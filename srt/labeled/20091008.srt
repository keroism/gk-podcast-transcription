00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:18,189
Scott: It's Thursday, October 8th, I'm Scott, I'm Rip, and this is GeekNights, tonight with the book club Der Steppenwolf.

2
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,048
Scott: Let's do this.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,780
Rym: I've been rollerblading to the train station every day because my car, like the brakes are busted and I just haven't had a chance to take it to a mechanic.

4
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:39,280
Scott: You haven't had the experience of driving on the brand new road.

5
00:00:39,982 --> 00:00:41,720
Scott: Ah, it's so smooth.

6
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,860
Rym: I had the experience of rollerblading on that road and let me tell you.

7
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,280
Scott: They paved our road, by the way.

8
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,520
Rym: It's a pleasant experience.

9
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,200
Scott: Our road that was desperately in need of paving was paved and it did an excellent job.

10
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:57,060
Scott: They did it very quickly and it's great.

11
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:04,060
Rym: In general, it makes me very happy that I live in this little city of Beacon because- The thing is I paid for this road with taxes and now I'm leaving.

12
00:01:05,404 --> 00:01:06,180
Rym: Well thanks for the road.

13
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,059
Scott: Yeah, great.

14
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:16,779
Rym: But the cool thing is, my only complaint about Beacon, other than the key food, is that all the infrastructure is shitty and old.

15
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:21,639
Rym: Like the power outages happen kind of often because like every pole is on the verge of death at any moment.

16
00:01:22,163 --> 00:01:23,640
Rym: Like at any second they're all just gonna fall over.

17
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,620
Scott: But I don't even have poles to be underground.

18
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:31,780
Rym: Yeah, all the modern suburbs are underground for the most part, at least the internal distribution in like a subdivision, not so much the like main carrier lines.

19
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,040
Scott: There's this city, everything's underground.

20
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,820
Rym: Yeah, including scary old steam pipes and electricity.

21
00:01:36,981 --> 00:01:38,540
Rym: No one knows where it's coming from or going.

22
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:47,140
Rym: But you know, Beacon, like my big complaint was all the old infrastructure, the busted roads, the busted sidewalks, and the elections are coming up.

23
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,415
Rym: And for a second I was thinking, "Huh, maybe I should figure out who's gonna raise taxes and fix this

24
00:01:52,457 --> 00:01:52,560
Rym: stuff.".

25
00:01:52,621 --> 00:01:54,457
Scott: I tried to figure out who to vote for, right?

26
00:01:55,525 --> 00:01:55,700
Scott: What?

27
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:05,760
Rym: Doesn't matter because in the last month it looks like they got all this government subsidy money from the bailout and the stimulus package and suddenly they're fixing everything.

28
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,479
Rym: Like they're replacing power poles and paving roads and fixing sidewalks.

29
00:02:10,362 --> 00:02:16,139
Scott: So I was trying to see who to vote for and I think I'm just gonna have to skip this vote because I happen to be moving very close to voting time.

30
00:02:17,263 --> 00:02:19,960
Scott: It's the local election, so it's the least important vote.

31
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,559
Rym: Well it's also the most important.

32
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,320
Scott: And I don't think I'll be registered in time to vote for like New York mayor, which could matter, but whatever.

33
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:31,800
Rym: Well think of it this way, it's the most important vote for you directly, but only if the candidates are reasonably different.

34
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,120
Scott: But anyway, so I looked at like the cards.

35
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,879
Scott: Apparently all the candidates go house to house.

36
00:02:37,301 --> 00:02:40,400
Scott: But when they came to our house, of course we were not home because we commute.

37
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:41,580
Scott: Yeah, great.

38
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,259
Scott: Good job, guys.

39
00:02:42,846 --> 00:02:44,080
Scott: And they all left little cards.

40
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,019
Scott: So I read little cards that they left.

41
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,819
Rym: I remember last time there was an election here, both parties basically said they would do the exact same thing.

42
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:57,579
Scott: And one of the cards though, I remember one of the cards and it said one item on one of the cards really stood out to me.

43
00:02:57,921 --> 00:03:03,020
Scott: It said, took money back from the MTA, so money doesn't leave our county.

44
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:06,159
Scott: And I was like, I was like, fuck you.

45
00:03:06,502 --> 00:03:07,099
Rym: You bastard.

46
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,339
Scott: The only reason my money came into your county is because the train is there.

47
00:03:10,642 --> 00:03:12,420
Scott: Without that train, you wouldn't have nothing.

48
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,300
Rym: I like beacon.

49
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,160
Rym: If there was no train, I would be living in Manhattan.

50
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,319
Rym: Cause what else am I going to do?

51
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,677
Scott: So it's like, uh, I, I didn't know who to vote for, but I knew not that guy anyway.

52
00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:24,160
Rym: Yeah.

53
00:03:24,241 --> 00:03:25,340
Rym: But you know, rollerblading.

54
00:03:25,621 --> 00:03:38,140
Rym: So I have my rollerblades in the city and one thing I've never really done in my life is rollerbladed in a dense urban environment, but muse games, you know, Emily and Alex, the game company, they made their game guns of Icarus and we had a game party last night.

55
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:39,779
Rym: So I was going to go.

56
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:46,880
Rym: It's downtown and I decided to rollerblade from midtown to Chinatown during the like rush hour commute.

57
00:03:47,184 --> 00:03:47,418
Scott: Good job.

58
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,640
Rym: That was one of the more exhilarating and death defying things I've ever done in my life.

59
00:03:53,761 --> 00:03:54,899
Scott: You need a helmet for that shit.

60
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,220
Rym: Actually, a helmet probably wouldn't have done me any good.

61
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,260
Rym: I had my, our risk guards.

62
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,037
Rym: That's really all you need.

63
00:04:00,162 --> 00:04:03,299
Scott: A helmet would have done you some good if a car hit you, a car wasn't going to hit me.

64
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:03,959
Scott: It could have.

65
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:04,720
Rym: I wasn't too worried.

66
00:04:05,122 --> 00:04:07,619
Rym: I got to say the most dangerous place to be.

67
00:04:08,163 --> 00:04:10,660
Rym: If you're on the street, it's one of those fucking bike lanes.

68
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,680
Rym: You're better off just in traffic dodging buses than in those bike lanes.

69
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:23,197
Scott: Well, it depends on which bike lane, you know, it's like, um, you know, the bike lane, like on Broadway is actually really wide and has a barrier next to it and like cars can't get into it.

70
00:04:23,366 --> 00:04:23,559
Scott: You know?

71
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,500
Rym: So it's like stretch.

72
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,579
Rym: You realize you get past that stretch and there's people just like parked blocking it.

73
00:04:27,888 --> 00:04:28,159
Rym: Oh yeah.

74
00:04:28,404 --> 00:04:29,080
Rym: It's like, wow, great.

75
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:29,698
Rym: Thanks dude.

76
00:04:30,042 --> 00:04:31,560
Scott: Bike people just sort of get used to it.

77
00:04:32,161 --> 00:04:32,699
Rym: And you know what?

78
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,699
Rym: Rollerbladers too.

79
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:49,958
Rym: But I got to say it was kind of awesome just dodging buses and going all over the street and cutting across and trying to figure out how to get to, I don't know if I'll do it again anytime soon because I afterward I thought maybe I might've died, but, uh, it was fun at least once.

80
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,259
Rym: I feel like everyone should do that at least once in their life.

81
00:04:52,681 --> 00:04:59,579
Scott: You know, there's like, you know, the thing is, you know, if you've never done it before, I could understand why you think, oh man, is death defying whatever, right?

82
00:05:00,681 --> 00:05:03,260
Scott: It's like little old ladies riding their bicycles around New York city.

83
00:05:03,381 --> 00:05:06,400
Scott: It is not nearly a dangerous death, defying kind of thing.

84
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,360
Scott: It just feels like it.

85
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,260
Scott: If you're not used to it as soon as you're used to it, it's just like, oh, whatever.

86
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:17,355
Rym: Cause I've ridden bikes in that sort of traffic and in fact I've ridden bikes in the city before and it's a completely different experience from rollerblading one.

87
00:05:17,396 --> 00:05:24,799
Rym: rollerblades are not like you can maneuver very well, but what you cannot do quickly in the street without a bunch of space around you is stop.

88
00:05:26,421 --> 00:05:34,220
Rym: And also cars apparently just can't see a rollerblader like they did like bikes at least like they, they see bikes and they know I'm there.

89
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:39,419
Rym: And while they might be mad at me and they might cut it close, I don't worry that the cars are just going to hit me out.

90
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:39,713
Rym: Right.

91
00:05:40,181 --> 00:05:41,440
Rym: Cars almost just hit me out.

92
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,919
Rym: Just like I was completely invisible.

93
00:05:44,902 --> 00:05:48,159
Rym: I hit a guy's car with the shoes I was carrying after he almost hit me.

94
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:56,580
Scott: If I do think about it, most of the time I've ever seen any sort of non bikes in the city, like skateboard guys and a blade.

95
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,760
Rym: It's always like in the, they're always on the sidewalk.

96
00:05:58,927 --> 00:05:59,180
Scott: Yeah.

97
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,400
Scott: They don't really go down the street.

98
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,771
Rym: So I tried to go down the sidewalk.

99
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:02,840
Rym: that was even more dangerous.

100
00:06:03,707 --> 00:06:03,897
Scott: Yeah.

101
00:06:04,346 --> 00:06:04,431
Scott: Yeah.

102
00:06:04,741 --> 00:06:06,960
Scott: Anyway, so I'm still moving.

103
00:06:07,282 --> 00:06:08,660
Scott: I'm getting, making a good progress.

104
00:06:08,986 --> 00:06:09,739
Scott: I have the keys.

105
00:06:09,862 --> 00:06:10,679
Scott: I've got stuff.

106
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,660
Scott: I'm going to get deliveries and whatnot.

107
00:06:13,062 --> 00:06:14,360
Scott: I went today to get a mattress.

108
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,577
Scott: So I may say I went to the sleepies nearest my work because they have sleepies, not mattress King.

109
00:06:19,365 --> 00:06:20,380
Scott: Where is there a mattress King?

110
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,039
Rym: I don't even know if that's a real place.

111
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:22,455
Scott: I know.

112
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:22,689
Scott: Right.

113
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,980
Rym: The thing is, right.

114
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,240
Rym: It sounds like it should be a real place.

115
00:06:25,561 --> 00:06:33,439
Scott: I usually, I would shop around for something like this and usually I would shop online also, but a mattress, you got to lay in it, you know, before you buy it.

116
00:06:33,761 --> 00:06:36,040
Scott: And a mattress is something you're going to have for a long time.

117
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:40,139
Scott: Like the matches I have now I've had for eight years, you know?

118
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:40,959
Rym: Wow.

119
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,039
Rym: The mattress I've had, I have now I've had for nine years.

120
00:06:44,411 --> 00:06:44,600
Scott: Yeah.

121
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:51,800
Scott: I mean, and you know, the dude at the mattress place was like, look, you know, he was, he was a real friendly guy, but he obviously was a skilled mattress salesman.

122
00:06:52,264 --> 00:06:53,399
Scott: There was no question about that.

123
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,599
Scott: Cause he's like, look, a mattress is something you got.

124
00:06:56,002 --> 00:06:59,700
Rym: He go up to you and he's like, the more expensive ones are clearly superior.

125
00:07:00,184 --> 00:07:00,229
Scott: No.

126
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:06,138
Scott: What he actually said was, look, a mattress is something you're going to have, you know, for like 10 years, if not more right.

127
00:07:07,021 --> 00:07:12,499
Scott: It's you're going to spend how much time on it, half your day, every day, or at least like a 30 year day, every day.

128
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:19,857
Scott: You know, you, you should get a good one, even if it costs more, you know, which is kind of true.

129
00:07:20,261 --> 00:07:23,340
Rym: Well, considering I'm sitting in an Aeron chair and you have a human freedom chair.

130
00:07:23,461 --> 00:07:25,893
Rym: I think that is exactly the argument to use on someone like.

131
00:07:25,954 --> 00:07:28,099
Scott: that is exactly the argument that I used on myself.

132
00:07:29,285 --> 00:07:31,040
Rym: I was like, well, you know, what matches did you get?

133
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,559
Scott: I got, Oh, what the, I forget what the hell it was.

134
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:39,340
Rym: It was, I forget to compare features because I, my mattress is a very expensive mattress.

135
00:07:39,581 --> 00:07:43,240
Scott: And I think the mattress is like $1,200, but that's about what mine was.

136
00:07:43,601 --> 00:07:45,897
Scott: So I, uh, you know, I basically, I knew, right.

137
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,000
Scott: The thing is we had that thread in the forum.

138
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:51,239
Scott: Like you can't avoid these psychological tricks, even though you know, they're there.

139
00:07:51,802 --> 00:07:57,600
Scott: The thing was what I did is I said, okay, psychological trick number one, the expensive wine tastes better, right?

140
00:07:57,722 --> 00:07:58,216
Scott: I knew that.

141
00:07:58,541 --> 00:07:59,238
Scott: So you know what I did?

142
00:07:59,741 --> 00:08:05,420
Scott: I laid on the mattresses and didn't look at any price tags, but until I had already determined which ones I liked better.

143
00:08:05,847 --> 00:08:06,379
Rym: Ah, good idea.

144
00:08:06,682 --> 00:08:06,772
Rym: Yep.

145
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,684
Rym: So what's the plan?

146
00:08:08,005 --> 00:08:14,440
Rym: unless like something ludicrous, like you ask and it's a thousand, a hundred thousand dollars just to pick what everyone felt the best, no matter what kind of.

147
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,520
Scott: And then trick number two, right.

148
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:22,015
Scott: Was I knew that you'd sort of remember which ones you slept in based on the order you like laid on them in.

149
00:08:22,761 --> 00:08:25,740
Scott: So I laid out, I kept switching between them in different patterns.

150
00:08:25,901 --> 00:08:30,480
Scott: You know, I kept going back and forth across the store and you know, to try, you know, to compare better.

151
00:08:30,962 --> 00:08:37,360
Scott: And a lot of this was really helpful because there were a lot of sort of like these test mattresses where it'd be like, you know, half the mattress is one way and half was the other way.

152
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,879
Scott: So you can just sort of roll over to sort of get a different feel.

153
00:08:40,861 --> 00:08:43,039
Rym: And some people buy actual mattresses like that.

154
00:08:43,227 --> 00:08:43,418
Rym: Yeah.

155
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:48,220
Scott: I also tested out these pillows and I found like the best pillow.

156
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:54,080
Scott: So I carry that same pillow to all the mattresses to get to get, you know, the correct comparison.

157
00:08:54,302 --> 00:08:55,740
Scott: You know, I'd always be using the same pillow.

158
00:08:56,422 --> 00:08:59,240
Scott: And then I picked a mattress and I'm like, yeah, just fucking give me this mattress.

159
00:08:59,360 --> 00:08:59,817
Scott: God damn it.

160
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,239
Scott: Whatever.

161
00:09:00,762 --> 00:09:01,579
Scott: But they have a policy.

162
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,640
Scott: If I think I can find the mattress cheaper, like elsewhere, I can get my money.

163
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,300
Scott: I can get the difference plus 10 percent.

164
00:09:07,741 --> 00:09:12,458
Scott: So I'm going to go and shop around, see if I can find that mattress online for less money and get some money back.

165
00:09:13,701 --> 00:09:19,479
Scott: But yeah, the one thing that I learned going there because I went there during lunch, I'm trying to move without missing any work.

166
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:21,759
Scott: So like every lunch, I'm doing something.

167
00:09:24,561 --> 00:09:31,380
Scott: If you have lunch in New York City or just pretty much anywhere, spend your lunch at the mattress store.

168
00:09:31,745 --> 00:09:32,599
Scott: It's like free naps.

169
00:09:33,167 --> 00:09:33,780
Scott: I mean, come on.

170
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,680
Rym: How long will they let me sleep before they come in a cost me?

171
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:47,300
Scott: This guy was like, like totally, you know, of course I was buying a mattress, but he was like, he was like encouraging me to just like lay around his store and, you know, not leave until I, you know, bought something.

172
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:53,523
Scott: But, you know, you know, he might catch on after three years, be like, you know, I was already like.

173
00:09:53,804 --> 00:09:57,121
Scott: he was like super friendly, you know, I totally love to be friends with that guy.

174
00:09:57,744 --> 00:10:01,060
Rym: Are you sure it wasn't professionally friendly, like the people in the fancy hotels?

175
00:10:01,341 --> 00:10:02,380
Scott: He seemed genuinely friendly.

176
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,002
Rym: It's hard to say.

177
00:10:03,022 --> 00:10:08,198
Rym: Yeah, I mean, he was trying to get you to buy a mattress more than a thousand dollars.

178
00:10:08,581 --> 00:10:12,157
Scott: I know it's like it was weird because it was like the perfect salesman, like I was.

179
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,440
Scott: his sales skills were either so good either.

180
00:10:15,761 --> 00:10:26,759
Scott: A, he was just genuinely super awesome or B, his sales skills were so awesome that, you know, whatever he can take my money because like, you know, some guys, their salesman, they come off with the hard sell.

181
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:31,900
Scott: This guy just came off as like this guy I want to hang out with because he's so great.

182
00:10:32,462 --> 00:10:34,640
Scott: And he knew a lot about mattresses.

183
00:10:36,441 --> 00:10:41,660
Scott: I might have to go meet this guy, go to the sleepies on 57th Avenue, New York, Manhattan.

184
00:10:41,924 --> 00:10:43,000
Rym: So what do you pay you for an ad?

185
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,240
Rym: Is that just going out here?

186
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:48,261
Scott: No, he was just real friendly and his psychological tricks worked on me despite me trying.

187
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:54,397
Scott: I avoided the trick of judging the mattress by the price, but I couldn't avoid the trick of good salesmen.

188
00:10:55,761 --> 00:10:57,260
Rym: So I had to go there at some point.

189
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,239
Rym: My mattress is getting old.

190
00:10:59,621 --> 00:11:01,140
Scott: Oh, apparently the mattress I have.

191
00:11:01,481 --> 00:11:04,880
Scott: I don't have to turn it over every six months.

192
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:09,100
Scott: I asked him, like, you know, so when, you know, should I turn my mattress over?

193
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,300
Scott: He's like, no, new mattresses don't have to turn them over.

194
00:11:11,582 --> 00:11:11,824
Scott: Wow.

195
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:13,520
Rym: I got to turn mine over every six months.

196
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,780
Scott: He did have one trick that I didn't fall for, though.

197
00:11:16,265 --> 00:11:17,360
Rym: I tried to sell you something.

198
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:20,740
Scott: Apparently the mattress has like a huge warranty, right?

199
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:25,263
Scott: Like if a spring pops out like in an old cartoon, I get, you know, they'll replace the whole thing.

200
00:11:25,344 --> 00:11:27,440
Rym: So he tried to sell you some sort of special warranty.

201
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:33,442
Scott: Apparently, mattress companies, all the mattress manufacturers have a trick in their warranties.

202
00:11:34,084 --> 00:11:38,478
Scott: If there's any stain whatsoever on the mattress, your warranty is just gone.

203
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:40,759
Scott: That's the trick.

204
00:11:40,881 --> 00:11:42,579
Scott: So why is this a trick?

205
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,740
Scott: Because they want to sell you a mattress cover.

206
00:11:46,442 --> 00:11:46,846
Rym: Wait, wait.

207
00:11:46,886 --> 00:11:48,240
Rym: One of those plastic things.

208
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:48,864
Scott: No, no, no.

209
00:11:48,924 --> 00:11:50,700
Scott: A mattress pad like I have already.

210
00:11:51,141 --> 00:11:51,362
Scott: Right.

211
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:58,740
Scott: The thing is, so you had these fancy mattress pads and he was like, oh, this one is hypoallergenic and this one keeps the dust mites out and this one's waterproof.

212
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,343
Scott: And they're right.

213
00:11:59,747 --> 00:12:01,380
Scott: And I was like, whoa, I don't need waterproof.

214
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:05,939
Scott: Well, he's like, imagine if you spill a glass of wine, you know, on your bed.

215
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,220
Scott: I'm like, well, you know, I'll lose my problem with that.

216
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:15,819
Rym: Is that if you want if you have a cheap mattress, then, yeah, like that artificial mattress pad, like pillow top cover, you need that.

217
00:12:16,381 --> 00:12:27,040
Rym: But if you have a mattress that already has the pillow top on it and you don't care that it's eventually going to have the vague color of body oil in the part you sleep on, I think is I have a mattress pad.

218
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,157
Scott: He was trying to sell me a mattress pad for like 70 bucks.

219
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,404
Scott: That was all fancy.

220
00:12:31,027 --> 00:12:38,980
Scott: And the thing was that mattress pad, a lot of the features of it that he claimed were duplicated in my already, you know, existing mattress.

221
00:12:39,122 --> 00:12:40,300
Rym: I got a waterproof mattress.

222
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:45,582
Scott: No, not the waterproof part, but like, you know, the anti allergen dust mite parts, whatever.

223
00:12:45,683 --> 00:12:47,579
Scott: I just ignored that anyway, but because I don't need that.

224
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,222
Rym: But regardless, I like you had to throw that in there just in case, like, oh, but I don't need that.

225
00:12:51,302 --> 00:12:51,583
Rym: Yeah.

226
00:12:51,683 --> 00:12:58,019
Scott: So I think is I'll just buy the same kind of mattress pad that I already have for a lot less than seventy dollars.

227
00:12:59,203 --> 00:13:00,860
Scott: So I was like, no, no mattress pad.

228
00:13:00,961 --> 00:13:02,320
Scott: Just deliver this to my apartment.

229
00:13:02,502 --> 00:13:03,127
Scott: So thank you.

230
00:13:03,773 --> 00:13:04,500
Rym: Fascinating.

231
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:04,861
Rym: Yeah.

232
00:13:05,003 --> 00:13:06,218
Scott: But yeah, free naps.

233
00:13:07,562 --> 00:13:13,919
Rym: Oh, yeah, until they realize you're not actually buying a mattress, then they don't let you back into the store, different disguise every day.

234
00:13:14,723 --> 00:13:15,937
Rym: I don't have that many disguises.

235
00:13:16,721 --> 00:13:21,242
Scott: Oh, go to different mattress stores like consecutive days with a disguise and rotate it around.

236
00:13:21,906 --> 00:13:24,220
Rym: So anyway, you know, it's Thursday.

237
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,440
Rym: We always try to make Thursday just fun and mixed up.

238
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,204
Rym: And we don't have to.

239
00:13:27,667 --> 00:13:30,945
Rym: it's not like we have to follow the format and do the news and all the stuff we normally do.

240
00:13:31,005 --> 00:13:34,919
Rym: And it's time to do the book club, which we should have done last Thursday's show.

241
00:13:35,501 --> 00:13:40,721
Rym: But I know I called Scott's bluff because he was like, well, I think the book will be done.

242
00:13:40,762 --> 00:13:44,020
Rym: I'll finish it and we'll do the book club the next gig nights Thursday.

243
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:44,805
Rym: And I was like, OK.

244
00:13:45,247 --> 00:13:47,762
Rym: And I didn't even bother finishing the book because I assume Scott wouldn't.

245
00:13:48,225 --> 00:13:50,299
Rym: And then Scott finished the book and I didn't.

246
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,331
Scott: So that's right.

247
00:13:51,635 --> 00:13:51,979
Rym: I had to.

248
00:13:52,823 --> 00:13:53,025
Rym: Yeah.

249
00:13:53,045 --> 00:13:53,206
Rym: Yeah.

250
00:13:53,368 --> 00:13:54,739
Scott: So I made you look like a fool.

251
00:13:55,362 --> 00:13:57,060
Rym: Yeah, but I finished the book anyway.

252
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,139
Scott: The long delayed book club.

253
00:13:59,802 --> 00:14:02,520
Scott: I feel like we haven't done any Thursday episodes other than book clubs.

254
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,059
Scott: Like we just keep skipping Thursdays.

255
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,780
Rym: I said we haven't done the book club in forever.

256
00:14:05,901 --> 00:14:08,900
Rym: And I how many of you actually read Stephen Wolf?

257
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:15,539
Scott: I think the thing is, from now on, starting today during the meta moment, I met a minute, whatever you want to call it.

258
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,050
Scott: Metamucil.

259
00:14:16,296 --> 00:14:16,460
Scott: Right.

260
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:23,960
Scott: I'm going to keep saying that during the meta segment of our show, I'm going to announce the book club book every single show speaking.

261
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:27,240
Rym: I think that will help of which it's your turn to pick.

262
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,248
Rym: What is the next book club?

263
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:29,500
Scott: Well, we'll talk about that later.

264
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:30,939
Rym: Oh, we're going to the second half now.

265
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,341
Rym: Yeah.

266
00:14:32,264 --> 00:14:36,818
Scott: So anyway, we read Steppenwolf now by what I want to say.

267
00:14:38,662 --> 00:14:41,140
Scott: OK, I hope that's all you with that pronunciation.

268
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,840
Rym: Somebody emailed us and said Ehrman essay.

269
00:14:44,261 --> 00:14:50,375
Scott: But yes, no, but someone emailed us who was like a scholar in this sort of, you know, in this German literature.

270
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:50,659
Scott: Right.

271
00:14:51,282 --> 00:14:54,140
Scott: So I am not, you know, putting them down in any way.

272
00:14:54,221 --> 00:14:55,860
Scott: In fact, I think that's totally awesome.

273
00:14:56,262 --> 00:15:00,160
Scott: And I totally respect everything that they have to say about this book.

274
00:15:00,381 --> 00:15:06,425
Rym: You know, that is pretty much the standard boilerplate for dudes about to get punched intellectually.

275
00:15:06,608 --> 00:15:07,258
Scott: No, not at all.

276
00:15:08,121 --> 00:15:09,046
Scott: The thing is, right.

277
00:15:09,086 --> 00:15:16,860
Scott: He was like basically in his email was like, you have to let me come on the episode where you talk about the show so I can talk about all these intellectual bits that you won't understand.

278
00:15:16,981 --> 00:15:21,969
Scott: Just reading it once without, you know, the meta context of, you know, the scholarly knowledges and all that.

279
00:15:22,453 --> 00:15:23,200
Scott: And you know what?

280
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,327
Scott: He's probably exactly right.

281
00:15:24,347 --> 00:15:26,180
Scott: There's probably a whole bunch of shit we don't know.

282
00:15:26,441 --> 00:15:30,767
Scott: We're going to sound like complete morons if like a literature scholar listens to this episode.

283
00:15:31,091 --> 00:15:31,820
Scott: That's all correct.

284
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:44,340
Scott: The thing is, uh, the GeekNights Book Club, the goal is get people to read because people don't read books anymore as much read a book.

285
00:15:44,641 --> 00:15:45,183
Scott: Exactly.

286
00:15:45,263 --> 00:15:55,860
Scott: So and I think that talking about a book in the scholarly way that we would appreciate as smart peoples that we are, would not really do such a good job of getting illiterates.

287
00:15:56,402 --> 00:16:06,665
Rym: Scott, I will say this, you know what you've actually just said, what I am here by covering my ass to make sure that no one realizes that I did not analyze this book in any depth.

288
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:07,939
Scott: I analyze it in depth.

289
00:16:08,381 --> 00:16:16,880
Scott: What I'm saying is that I want to get the guy to do to talk about all the scholarliness on another episode and not this episode.

290
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:17,663
Rym: I do agree with that.

291
00:16:17,723 --> 00:16:23,480
Rym: I want to split up because it's kind of like I read Steppenwolf, not necessarily from the academic perspective.

292
00:16:23,601 --> 00:16:31,269
Rym: Like if I was reading a book to analyze, like I used to do in high school and college or with certain books that I reread, like The Prince of Nothing, I'll sit there and like I'll analyze.

293
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:31,860
Rym: I'll take notes.

294
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,140
Rym: I'll think I'll try to like, oh, well, he quoted this.

295
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,680
Rym: I wonder if it was referencing this earlier and all that sort of stuff.

296
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:40,400
Rym: But I read this the way I would approach reading like any fiction novel.

297
00:16:40,561 --> 00:16:43,080
Rym: I just read it straight up, just go, let's go.

298
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:43,926
Rym: I didn't go back.

299
00:16:43,966 --> 00:16:45,760
Rym: I didn't find quotes again or anything.

300
00:16:46,001 --> 00:16:49,240
Rym: And I just have my straight up unadulterated opinion.

301
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,639
Rym: I never read this book in school.

302
00:16:50,961 --> 00:16:54,280
Rym: I never had anyone like analyze it for me or explain anything for me.

303
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,379
Rym: I even avoided looking at the Wikipedia page.

304
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,180
Scott: Yeah, I didn't look at the Wikipedia page at all.

305
00:16:58,662 --> 00:17:00,819
Scott: I know nothing about this book other than what was in the book.

306
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:10,663
Rym: So I want to point out before we continue, if you have not already read Steppenwolf, stop listening, because we're about to talk about Steppenwolf as though you've already read it.

307
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,519
Scott: Can we really spoil Steppenwolf?

308
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:21,790
Rym: I mean, I kind of even then if someone listens, I'm not going to be like, so the plot was that there was this man named Herman Allen stabs a bitch.

309
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:24,888
Rym: The end.

310
00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:25,115
Rym: Yeah.

311
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:34,980
Rym: Anyway, but just warning, we're going to spoil this book and it's not that spoilable, but I'd recommend you read it before you listen to what we're about to say.

312
00:17:35,822 --> 00:17:36,083
Scott: Right.

313
00:17:36,103 --> 00:17:40,000
Rym: So the first thing I want to jump right into the pretty much the biggest part.

314
00:17:40,604 --> 00:17:41,840
Rym: I don't think Hermione was real.

315
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,979
Rym: I think that was just all in his head the whole time.

316
00:17:45,342 --> 00:17:46,208
Scott: You don't think what was real?

317
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:47,980
Rym: The girl, the main character girl.

318
00:17:48,382 --> 00:17:51,219
Rym: I don't think there was any from the very beginning when he first met her.

319
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,960
Scott: I was the way you said her name.

320
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,740
Scott: I guess I was mispronouncing your name where you are on her mind.

321
00:17:55,921 --> 00:17:56,752
Rym: What are you going to call her?

322
00:17:56,894 --> 00:17:57,259
Scott: I don't know.

323
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:57,928
Scott: Herman.

324
00:17:57,948 --> 00:17:58,659
Rym: Her many.

325
00:17:59,563 --> 00:18:00,189
Scott: I have no idea.

326
00:18:00,209 --> 00:18:01,320
Rym: I go with Hermione.

327
00:18:01,862 --> 00:18:03,053
Scott: OK, whatever.

328
00:18:04,781 --> 00:18:07,260
Rym: That's probably just like hung himself.

329
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:07,761
Scott: Yeah.

330
00:18:07,822 --> 00:18:08,023
Scott: Right.

331
00:18:08,686 --> 00:18:11,860
Scott: But that's actually that gives us a good tangent.

332
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:12,102
Scott: Right.

333
00:18:12,122 --> 00:18:13,420
Scott: This book is really written in German.

334
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:13,781
Scott: Right.

335
00:18:14,267 --> 00:18:15,360
Scott: We're reading a translation.

336
00:18:15,864 --> 00:18:16,491
Scott: Is that correct?

337
00:18:16,511 --> 00:18:16,693
Rym: Yes.

338
00:18:17,401 --> 00:18:17,723
Rym: Yeah.

339
00:18:17,783 --> 00:18:20,880
Scott: So, I mean, I wonder what was lost in translation here.

340
00:18:21,081 --> 00:18:22,280
Scott: Obviously something.

341
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,204
Scott: I mean, there's parts in this book where there are like poems and rhymes and various things of that nature.

342
00:18:27,605 --> 00:18:31,842
Scott: You know, how well were those translated from, you know, the original?

343
00:18:31,922 --> 00:18:45,842
Scott: I mean, you know, I was like every time something like that came up, a poem or a rhyme or something or some song lyrics or anything along those lines, like I always just thought like, huh, I wonder what I'm missing here, that it not being in German.

344
00:18:46,707 --> 00:18:48,720
Rym: Well, here's a note from the translation.

345
00:18:49,381 --> 00:18:56,060
Rym: This is the first revised edition of Basil Creighton's translation of 1929.

346
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:56,302
Rym: Whoa.

347
00:18:56,624 --> 00:18:58,740
Rym: That's good in a way, because it was contemporary English.

348
00:18:59,341 --> 00:18:59,940
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

349
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,980
Rym: In the revision, we were intent on a more exact.

350
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,801
Rym: So they revised it in 1963.

351
00:19:04,801 --> 00:19:05,711
Rym: But the base is the 1929 one.

352
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,140
Rym: We exact and more readily understood rendition.

353
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,499
Rym: British spellings and idioms have been Americanized.

354
00:19:12,881 --> 00:19:17,764
Rym: Germanisms removed, awkward sentences improved and misleading translations corrected.

355
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,000
Scott: I want the Germanisms, though.

356
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:20,944
Scott: Oh, well, yeah.

357
00:19:20,964 --> 00:19:23,900
Rym: But how are you going to go down the road of the fan subs?

358
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,640
Scott: No, but I just wonder what I'm missing.

359
00:19:28,261 --> 00:19:35,759
Rym: Yeah, well, I feel in any translated work, if you really if you go beyond, I mean, let's be perfectly honest here, right?

360
00:19:36,601 --> 00:19:43,040
Scott: What's lost in translation matters a lot more in a great literary work than it does in an anime, even if it's a great anime.

361
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:43,967
Scott: I mean, come on.

362
00:19:44,028 --> 00:19:44,312
Scott: Right.

363
00:19:44,515 --> 00:19:44,860
Scott: Seriously.

364
00:19:45,321 --> 00:19:45,482
Scott: Yeah.

365
00:19:45,724 --> 00:19:54,559
Rym: So well, what I would just say is that if you're going to take any work seriously, like if you really like if Steppenwolf meant something to you beyond just being a novel, you got to learn German and read in German.

366
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:06,260
Rym: Well, what I would recommend is in the very least read of any work like this, a literal kind of translation and independently of that, a kind of like modernly rendered, you know, proper translation.

367
00:20:07,524 --> 00:20:08,680
Scott: Not a bad idea either.

368
00:20:09,162 --> 00:20:09,323
Scott: Yeah.

369
00:20:09,424 --> 00:20:19,182
Scott: Usually reading multiple translations, you can sort of add them together and sort of sort of infer what the original route was that someone could translate in those two different ways.

370
00:20:20,087 --> 00:20:39,520
Rym: But pretty much from the beginning, I just I figured that she was completely in his head and that was all just either in his head or in the very least he was you know, the character was taking his experience and writing about it as though the experience, everything was this girl, you know, because this is all read by the other main character nominally.

371
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,826
Scott: Well, yes, that's the thing, right?

372
00:20:40,846 --> 00:20:42,537
Scott: You look at this book as a whole, right?

373
00:20:42,738 --> 00:20:50,660
Scott: And what really drew me into the book was that first part where you have the guy talking about the Steppenwolf who lived in his same apartment building as he was.

374
00:20:50,781 --> 00:20:51,043
Scott: Right.

375
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:53,520
Scott: And that part was pretty awesome.

376
00:20:53,701 --> 00:20:58,100
Scott: And then the rest of the book is not the Steppenwolf talking directly.

377
00:20:58,281 --> 00:21:03,060
Scott: But this dude read, you know, reading the memoirs that the Steppenwolf left behind.

378
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:08,022
Scott: And he even says straight up like, yeah, I think a lot of the stuff in here is obviously not real.

379
00:21:08,845 --> 00:21:18,298
Scott: And I basically assumed like, OK, not all this anything in it that happens here that is fantastic in any sort of way is obviously not real.

380
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:19,342
Rym: Oh, yeah.

381
00:21:19,402 --> 00:21:23,940
Rym: But I'll go one step further and say that even the non fantastic meeting with this girl was completely.

382
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,954
Scott: Well, I mean, as soon as he pretty much from the point in the.

383
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:34,504
Scott: Memoirs where he like started seeing like the words appear like, you know, not for everyone.

384
00:21:34,524 --> 00:21:36,720
Scott: I was like, yeah, it's not from here on out.

385
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,462
Scott: Everything's fake.

386
00:21:37,924 --> 00:21:39,229
Rym: We'll see

387
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:40,976
Scott: hints of truth here and there, like

388
00:21:41,097 --> 00:21:55,071
Rym: having read other works by the author, I just I kind of got this impression that the intent there was to kind of express the this meta intent, the intent of the Steppenwolf, the guy writing this memoir, was that he had a profound revelation.

389
00:21:55,653 --> 00:22:05,319
Rym: and the profound revelation, if he had just explained the revelation, would not have felt so profound to someone analyzing it or reading about it, who didn't actually experience it.

390
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:19,119
Rym: So he translated his, you know, internal experience into this fantastical experience in order to express upon other people just the gravity of the feeling that he felt and the gravity of what happened to his life in his mind.

391
00:22:20,163 --> 00:22:22,740
Rym: So, you know, he didn't literally find a magic theater.

392
00:22:23,121 --> 00:22:29,302
Rym: He had some revelation that would have felt like finding a magical theater that opens your mind.

393
00:22:29,342 --> 00:22:36,740
Scott: And I think I think the part where he went to the to the professor's house, that was probably that was one of my favorite scenes.

394
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,423
Scott: That was pretty good.

395
00:22:37,443 --> 00:22:39,733
Scott: That was probably actually a mostly.

396
00:22:39,753 --> 00:22:42,780
Scott: I mean, like we talk about this, like, oh, that part was real.

397
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,424
Scott: That part wasn't.

398
00:22:43,645 --> 00:22:45,640
Scott: the whole book is a work of fiction, right?

399
00:22:45,923 --> 00:22:47,199
Scott: It's one of those books in a book.

400
00:22:47,621 --> 00:22:51,260
Scott: And the thing is, the book in a book always feel you think that would be sort of cliche.

401
00:22:51,781 --> 00:23:00,080
Scott: But every time I see the book in a book or even the book in a book in a book, which I have seen, it's out there, it works like really well.

402
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:03,176
Scott: I guess it's because nobody dares to do it unless they they're going to do it.

403
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:04,081
Scott: well, you know.

404
00:23:04,684 --> 00:23:09,459
Rym: But that's that whole scene where he sees that painting of Goeth and he's just like, fuck you painting.

405
00:23:12,601 --> 00:23:16,862
Rym: But actually, the reason I like that scene, too, is the thing is, I can really identify with that.

406
00:23:16,902 --> 00:23:21,845
Scott: You like how many times I see a painting of like some old historic character or a fictional character.

407
00:23:21,885 --> 00:23:24,379
Scott: And I'm like, that's not what the fuck that dude looks like.

408
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,686
Scott: But that wasn't his feeling.

409
00:23:25,806 --> 00:23:33,840
Rym: It was more it was such a complex feeling that at first he appreciates the painting and then he goes through these different like he and like he sees the painting and all these different layers.

410
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,464
Rym: And every time he peels away a layer, he gets more and more pissed off about the painting.

411
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:53,760
Rym: But that scene, too, is up until that point, the book pulls a couple of switcheroos on the Steppenwolf, because first, from the perspective of the dude just reading the memoir, you know, that bourgeois guy reading the memoir, the Steppenwolf is this fascinating and alluring character.

412
00:23:54,082 --> 00:23:55,760
Rym: And he seems cool.

413
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,887
Rym: He seems powerful.

414
00:23:56,927 --> 00:23:58,640
Rym: You think that is a man.

415
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,222
Rym: Look at that.

416
00:23:59,383 --> 00:23:59,504
Scott: Yeah.

417
00:23:59,524 --> 00:24:14,288
Scott: I mean, like, look at what the dude says about the Steppenwolf in the scene where they're like both in the music house and this or no, when they both go to see the lecturer and Steppenwolf gives them a look and he's like, oh, that look is incredibly powerful.

418
00:24:14,348 --> 00:24:16,159
Scott: Look, that's, you know, said so much.

419
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,544
Scott: Oh, my God.

420
00:24:17,564 --> 00:24:20,540
Rym: And then you get you get inside the Steppenwolf's head with his memoir.

421
00:24:20,641 --> 00:24:23,020
Rym: And again, like, oh, it's a man of two natures.

422
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,879
Rym: You feel like you're going along a certain way.

423
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:32,300
Rym: And then you find the Steppenwolf treatise and it's basically like, yeah, stupid old Steppenwolf making bullshit up in your head.

424
00:24:32,601 --> 00:24:33,772
Rym: That's all just crap.

425
00:24:33,812 --> 00:24:34,478
Rym: And you know it.

426
00:24:35,081 --> 00:24:35,383
Scott: Yeah.

427
00:24:35,666 --> 00:24:37,480
Scott: I liked how, you know, it was totally right.

428
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:44,920
Scott: It was like, you know, you sort of prevent for they present you with this analogy of, you know, that the the duality of the wolf and the man and whatever.

429
00:24:45,482 --> 00:24:45,724
Scott: And then.

430
00:24:45,744 --> 00:24:45,965
Scott: Yeah.

431
00:24:46,025 --> 00:24:53,417
Scott: And then the Steppenwolf book, the Steppenwolf treatise shows up and is like, look, is actually like a thousand bajillion components to the man.

432
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:55,368
Scott: that are all, you know, blah, blah, blah.

433
00:24:55,389 --> 00:24:57,120
Scott: It's like you can't possibly even understand.

434
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:57,987
Scott: It's so complex.

435
00:24:58,047 --> 00:24:59,300
Scott: It's like, oh, yeah, that's right.

436
00:24:59,861 --> 00:25:02,100
Scott: It's like someone gives you an analogy.

437
00:25:02,361 --> 00:25:07,927
Scott: And then, you know, at least in the book, they can just make this fictional world match that analogy.

438
00:25:07,947 --> 00:25:09,279
Scott: So you totally buy into it.

439
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:12,180
Scott: And then they sort of just like hit you over the head to remind you.

440
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,680
Scott: It's like, no, shit ain't that simple.

441
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,103
Scott: Stupid.

442
00:25:14,687 --> 00:25:16,660
Scott: It's like but then it was very refreshing.

443
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:25,360
Rym: Even then, you still you know, the way he reacts to the treatise and all that, you still feel like they're all these scenes where you feel like he's a a powerful and enigmatic and cool figure in general.

444
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:30,923
Rym: But the scene where he just kind of loses his cool and yells at the professor and like all of that together.

445
00:25:30,943 --> 00:25:46,960
Rym: And as the book goes on, you start to realize that, no, he's kind of just a jerk and a loner and he did it all to himself and he works himself up into these just fevers of just I don't know, he gets mad about stupid things for no good reason.

446
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:52,963
Rym: He blames it on himself and he's Steppenwolf and he's not a very likable fellow, both within and without.

447
00:25:53,083 --> 00:26:01,700
Scott: Well, I mean, the thing that I thought is like, you know, they build him up sort of early on, you know, they show him like saying really wise things like what was that really wise thing?

448
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:07,804
Rym: He said, oh, God, as the beginning, never, never have I read a book more quotable than this book.

449
00:26:08,046 --> 00:26:09,700
Rym: But there are quotes that you have to memorize.

450
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:20,759
Scott: They're like paragraph long quotation, just like my favorite one was still that one that was in the introductory part, like talking about men who live in their time and before their time and after their time.

451
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:27,303
Scott: No, but about, you know, men were made for land, you know, and that was the analogy at the end of that.

452
00:26:27,323 --> 00:26:33,060
Rym: But the whole thing before that was that, you know, the men who suffer, those who were born before the time where they would, you know, that's right.

453
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:33,422
Scott: Yeah.

454
00:26:33,462 --> 00:26:34,006
Scott: That one, too.

455
00:26:34,026 --> 00:26:35,679
Scott: Both of those pretty much.

456
00:26:36,863 --> 00:26:37,766
Scott: I sort of feel like that.

457
00:26:37,806 --> 00:26:43,170
Scott: both of those are what the books about, but regardless, the I forget what I was saying.

458
00:26:43,899 --> 00:26:44,000
Scott: Right.

459
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:44,522
Scott: All right.

460
00:26:44,542 --> 00:26:44,844
Scott: All right.

461
00:26:44,904 --> 00:26:47,980
Scott: Like men were made for, you know, the land.

462
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:53,045
Scott: And if you go into the sea and the sea, if you go in the sea, then you'll you know, you'll eventually drown.

463
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:55,757
Scott: And how I forget how much I had the exact quote.

464
00:26:55,837 --> 00:26:57,989
Scott: and on the book in front of me, I thought about getting all the.

465
00:26:58,331 --> 00:27:00,503
Rym: early on when I was reading, I was thinking, oh, that's a good quote.

466
00:27:00,523 --> 00:27:01,126
Rym: I was noting them.

467
00:27:01,207 --> 00:27:06,200
Scott: all like these are things I want to bring up, but not things that you can say quickly, like I Caramba.

468
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:18,562
Rym: Well, not only that, I realized that this book is one of those quotation per page books where it's just insight upon insight upon insight and quotation upon quotation upon quotation.

469
00:27:18,943 --> 00:27:24,962
Rym: And there are so many just half paragraph long aphorisms that I don't know what to say.

470
00:27:25,003 --> 00:27:25,566
Rym: They're brilliant.

471
00:27:25,586 --> 00:27:29,720
Rym: I just have to memorize them all because there is a quote for every occasion in Steppenwolf.

472
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:35,510
Scott: If you need to put someone down, it's like Queen, they got a song for every possible scenario.

473
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:36,440
Rym: It's exactly that.

474
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:45,643
Rym: If you need to be able to just trump anyone in any kind of philosophical argument, there is a Steppenwolf quote for you that will be relevant to whatever it is that you're talking about.

475
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:47,440
Scott: There's a lot of things like that.

476
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:51,308
Scott: I mean, you could probably do the same with like a playdoh, you know, you just any situation.

477
00:27:51,368 --> 00:27:52,279
Scott: I got a playdoh for that.

478
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:52,841
Scott: Watch out.

479
00:27:53,223 --> 00:27:57,943
Rym: Yeah, but the Steppenwolf ones are more pragmatically relevant to the real world.

480
00:27:57,963 --> 00:27:59,796
Scott: Yeah, I think it's weird.

481
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:10,987
Scott: It feels like the book is set up in a way at least that like I feel like, you know, it's like you read it and there are certain parts that you can like strongly relate to and there are certain parts that you don't.

482
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:17,844
Scott: But I sort of feel like the book was constructed so that no matter who you are, if you read it, you're going to strongly relate to some portion of it.

483
00:28:17,864 --> 00:28:22,384
Rym: Well, I think that's why on purpose people seem to really have very mixed feelings about this book.

484
00:28:22,424 --> 00:28:27,999
Rym: And a lot of people identify with it in basically completely opposite ways for the completely opposite reasons.

485
00:28:29,021 --> 00:28:39,340
Rym: I think it's because the idea of the Steppenwolf, like the idea of what he is, feels very alluring because it's almost this cop out, this answer like, ah, that explains me.

486
00:28:39,621 --> 00:28:40,789
Rym: I feel like the Steppenwolf.

487
00:28:40,809 --> 00:28:42,440
Rym: sometimes I feel like the outsider.

488
00:28:42,621 --> 00:28:50,780
Scott: That's the thing is they show you the Steppenwolf feeling so many different ways that you felt some of those ways before, no matter who you are, if you're a human being.

489
00:28:51,302 --> 00:29:05,240
Scott: And you sort of identify with those commonalities you have with the Steppenwolf and then those, you know, the things that you have in common with the Steppenwolf, you know, sort of grow larger in your view of him and the things you don't have in common with him sort of grow smaller.

490
00:29:05,762 --> 00:29:07,720
Scott: So then he just looks like you no matter who you are.

491
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,839
Scott: But he looks different to every person because every person is a different person.

492
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:11,161
Rym: Yep.

493
00:29:11,342 --> 00:29:15,924
Rym: And you could go one step further and say that the book means whatever you really wanted it to mean.

494
00:29:15,964 --> 00:29:16,386
Rym: But it does.

495
00:29:16,426 --> 00:29:24,984
Rym: it does it kind of cleverly where I could see people seeing the end of this book as a tragedy and as a victory, like I could see both interpretations.

496
00:29:25,326 --> 00:29:28,771
Rym: And I think it's really just a reflection of what kind of person you are as to how you take it.

497
00:29:29,016 --> 00:29:29,179
Scott: Yeah.

498
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:34,000
Scott: The thing is, I took it sort of like in this weird, completely neutral way.

499
00:29:34,341 --> 00:29:36,853
Scott: You know, it's like I just didn't like.

500
00:29:37,014 --> 00:29:38,320
Rym: I took it that I took it.

501
00:29:38,761 --> 00:29:47,901
Rym: I felt a lot at the end of the book, probably the same way Mozart felt about the Steppenwolf at the end of the book, just shaking your head like, dude, you just didn't get it.

502
00:29:49,249 --> 00:29:51,080
Scott: That was so weird when the Mozart showed up.

503
00:29:51,320 --> 00:30:03,400
Scott: That was great because because it was kind of like I just I just like imagined it like this crazy movie, like like suddenly Mozart appears and like I imagine I got my imagination of it was like completely unlike what was actually written.

504
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:09,089
Scott: Like I saw them like sitting like in chairs somewhere with like stars everywhere, like they were in outer space or something.

505
00:30:09,109 --> 00:30:10,580
Rym: I got that exact same vibe.

506
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,146
Rym: Really?

507
00:30:11,288 --> 00:30:11,814
Rym: And I think why?

508
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:20,942
Rym: Because he hinted this all the time and it was when he looked at that painting of Goeth and then later when he, you know, he talks about the celestial immortality and all those things.

509
00:30:21,585 --> 00:30:24,560
Rym: There is that feeling and I know you've experienced it.

510
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,404
Rym: I know I've experienced.

511
00:30:25,424 --> 00:30:27,114
Rym: I think a lot of people have experienced it where you.

512
00:30:27,135 --> 00:30:32,527
Rym: it's easy to forget that the immortals of the world and when I say immortals, I mean, you know, really.

513
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:33,000
Rym: Yeah.

514
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:40,200
Rym: People who effectively became immortal through their works, though not obviously living forever somewhere in a bunker.

515
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:40,708
Scott: Elvis.

516
00:30:41,015 --> 00:30:41,179
Rym: Yes.

517
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,023
Rym: Not like Elvis.

518
00:30:42,586 --> 00:30:58,200
Rym: But the whole the idea that is very easy to forget that they were people and to something to esteem upon their works, almost undo praise, maybe not undo is not the word, but it's almost easy to feel that they were transcendent geniuses.

519
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:04,159
Rym: They perceive the world beyond what anyone today could or beyond what I could, that they're beyond me.

520
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:11,060
Rym: And to strive for genius is to strive for this unattainable, peaceful, the celestial laughter of the sky and all those sorts of things.

521
00:31:11,981 --> 00:31:20,660
Rym: And you see the step of doing that, like he envisions these people, like he hates that painting of Goeth, but that's exactly how he sees Mozart.

522
00:31:21,001 --> 00:31:23,840
Rym: His mental picture of Mozart is the same as that painting.

523
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,765
Rym: And he didn't realize it.

524
00:31:24,826 --> 00:31:27,360
Rym: And then he meets Mozart and Mozart.

525
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,340
Scott: Mozart is just totally normal, like a jerk like everybody.

526
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:32,380
Scott: Yeah, Mozart was a jerk like everyone.

527
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:49,458
Scott: I mean, you know, whenever I start to like, you know, like praise famous people in that sort of way, which I do on occasion, you know, like raise, you know, these these sort of figures up to like a above human level, you can always think about Van Gogh is just completely nuts.

528
00:31:49,943 --> 00:31:51,539
Scott: But and that brings me back down.

529
00:31:51,901 --> 00:32:01,844
Rym: I think that's why we both pictured the same idea of like Mozart and all these people kind of sitting serenely among the stars, laughing the laughter of the immortals and this sort of.

530
00:32:02,269 --> 00:32:03,420
Rym: and that's what the Steppenwolf felt.

531
00:32:03,501 --> 00:32:05,739
Rym: And he felt like that's what he was striving for.

532
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:07,199
Rym: And that's what he had to do.

533
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,156
Scott: They were laughing at him, not with him.

534
00:32:11,741 --> 00:32:15,520
Rym: Except that's literally because that is kind of the point of the book.

535
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:22,080
Rym: I think that, you know, Mozart was a normal person and he got the world.

536
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:22,607
Rym: He got it.

537
00:32:22,627 --> 00:32:23,338
Rym: He laughed at it.

538
00:32:24,045 --> 00:32:25,240
Rym: At least Mozart of this book.

539
00:32:25,341 --> 00:32:26,419
Rym: Maybe not the real Mozart.

540
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,498
Rym: Yeah, I mean, it depends on what version of Mozart you're looking at.

541
00:32:30,642 --> 00:32:34,020
Scott: Oh, I could Salieri genius.

542
00:32:37,902 --> 00:32:39,519
Rym: These are originals.

543
00:32:43,562 --> 00:32:43,763
Scott: OK.

544
00:32:43,804 --> 00:32:45,236
Scott: Oh, man.

545
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:49,898
Rym: But that whole scene at the end, it actually reminded me I don't actually I got to.

546
00:32:50,179 --> 00:32:50,682
Rym: I need some help.

547
00:32:50,722 --> 00:32:53,280
Rym: Listeners, I saw something when I was a kid.

548
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,720
Rym: I don't know if it was a film, a short film.

549
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,419
Rym: I have no idea what it was.

550
00:32:58,661 --> 00:33:10,942
Rym: But it kept cutting between this old man talking about how he realized that he can sharpen pencils with a knife rather than using a pencil sharpener by just going around the edge with the knife.

551
00:33:11,905 --> 00:33:22,920
Rym: And these clowns in like this World War One prison and they kept making jokes and it ended with the clown giving the greatest joke of all.

552
00:33:23,263 --> 00:33:25,160
Rym: And he says he's going to do a magic trick for everyone.

553
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,920
Rym: And then they put him up against the wall and they shoot him and he just dies.

554
00:33:29,081 --> 00:33:29,885
Rym: And that was the trick.

555
00:33:30,469 --> 00:33:32,299
Rym: And I have no idea what this was.

556
00:33:33,124 --> 00:33:35,680
Rym: And like I have these student film.

557
00:33:36,021 --> 00:33:37,029
Rym: No, it was on TV, whatever.

558
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:44,899
Rym: But I was the whole end of Steppenwolf from the murder cars all the way to the end.

559
00:33:46,122 --> 00:33:49,460
Rym: I couldn't think of anything but this film and I have no idea what it is.

560
00:33:49,883 --> 00:33:52,018
Rym: And I wish I had more to explain, but I don't.

561
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,039
Rym: There's a tank in it at one point, like World War One kind of tank.

562
00:33:55,521 --> 00:33:58,280
Scott: I think one thing that was weird for me was that like murder cars.

563
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:58,822
Scott: No, no, no.

564
00:33:59,103 --> 00:34:08,971
Scott: Like earlier in the book, I sort of you know, I sort of was imagining like an older time, like, you know, obviously, I mean, what's the time period for this is like earlier 1900s, I'm guessing.

565
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:12,918
Rym: The book was written, you know, between World War One and World War Two.

566
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:13,402
Rym: Right.

567
00:34:13,462 --> 00:34:13,683
Scott: Right.

568
00:34:13,884 --> 00:34:17,684
Scott: But I was sort of like imagining it in like an almost like almost a Victorian world.

569
00:34:17,704 --> 00:34:21,460
Scott: Like I was imagining shit being old, like way, you know, much older.

570
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:35,300
Scott: And then like as the book got later on, you know, it's like the time, at least in the imagining in my head, like pushed it way up, like I was almost imagining like, you know, the 20s, you know, which I guess is what it's supposed to be.

571
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:35,520
Scott: Yeah.

572
00:34:35,882 --> 00:34:42,480
Scott: So it's like the way there was something about, you know, it you know, it started when like you met the girl and that sort of thing.

573
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:48,040
Scott: You know, the book like the time just fast forward in my head, sort of imagining like a different time period.

574
00:34:48,562 --> 00:34:50,940
Rym: Well, I feel the book was very timeless.

575
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:55,960
Rym: And I think ahead of its time in its perception of technology and the future.

576
00:34:55,980 --> 00:35:07,920
Rym: I mean, murder car aside, that whole part near the end where there was the talk of like modern world and the changing world and the whole idea that every generation feels like this is the end and everything's coming to chaos.

577
00:35:08,302 --> 00:35:08,918
Rym: That was true.

578
00:35:09,501 --> 00:35:17,482
Rym: But, you know, it's one thing we know that it's one of those things where, you know, that I know that the world's not falling apart anymore now than it was during the Greek Dark Ages.

579
00:35:17,502 --> 00:35:22,723
Rym: Well, I guess it really was falling apart during the Greek Dark Ages, but it was a renaissance.

580
00:35:23,567 --> 00:35:26,821
Rym: But that aside, like the whole every generation, like everything's falling apart.

581
00:35:26,921 --> 00:35:43,313
Rym: And yet to read the feeling of that in a book from the 30s to so literally see someone describing the decay of society exactly the way someone like me would feel it and describe it today in almost the exact same words, more

582
00:35:43,353 --> 00:35:45,362
Scott: shit changes, more shit stays the same.

583
00:35:45,704 --> 00:35:51,090
Rym: That whole murder car segment and the whole thing where Mozart pulls out the crappy gramophone.

584
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:52,360
Rym: He's like, listen to that.

585
00:35:52,621 --> 00:35:54,639
Rym: You can still hear the music even through the static.

586
00:35:55,202 --> 00:35:55,443
Scott: Yep.

587
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,240
Scott: That was that part with the gramophone.

588
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,640
Scott: That was fucking sweet.

589
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:02,360
Scott: That was brilliant because I was like, hells yeah.

590
00:36:02,701 --> 00:36:06,219
Scott: You know, there's the obvious surface level shit of shut the fuck up audio files.

591
00:36:08,528 --> 00:36:10,380
Scott: But, you know, it's like it's so true.

592
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:18,500
Scott: It's not the the actual, you know, the the the like the the details of the sensory input that really matter.

593
00:36:19,003 --> 00:36:21,420
Scott: You know, it's like you can dance to it just as well.

594
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:28,040
Scott: If it's, you know, full of static as if it's not as long as it's dance, as long as the signal is coming through, it's all good.

595
00:36:28,563 --> 00:36:30,080
Rym: You know, you can leave your friends behind.

596
00:36:30,541 --> 00:36:30,721
Rym: Yeah.

597
00:36:31,304 --> 00:36:35,761
Scott: And that, you know, that analogy is good for, you know, so many different kinds of messages.

598
00:36:35,862 --> 00:36:37,955
Rym: I think it was a broader metaphor, though, for it was.

599
00:36:38,056 --> 00:36:39,542
Rym: it was back to the whole Mozart thing of.

600
00:36:40,104 --> 00:36:47,660
Rym: he imagines this perfect clarity of, you know, the immortals of Mozart, of these people, of these achievements of genius.

601
00:36:48,621 --> 00:36:58,219
Rym: And he doesn't realize that the real world is full of static and noise and that nothing's ever as clear cut and perfect as he wants it to be in his head.

602
00:36:58,821 --> 00:37:04,724
Rym: And in the real world, you have to just accept the static and listen for the music behind the static.

603
00:37:05,006 --> 00:37:08,823
Rym: But if you look for just the music and you issue the static, you'll never find anything.

604
00:37:09,365 --> 00:37:15,000
Rym: And you'll die and boring old lonely man who may or may not have had gay orgy sex while taking cocaine.

605
00:37:15,844 --> 00:37:16,638
Scott: May or may not.

606
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:33,862
Rym: Actually, a funny moment when he when when he was talking to Hermione about Maria, who I want to talk about her separately, and he there's the point at which he's asking her like Maria tells him about something or Hermione tells him about some like technique of kissing that Maria

607
00:37:33,902 --> 00:37:34,183
Scott: had

608
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,897
Rym: and they talk about it and they're like, oh, no, we can't.

609
00:37:38,218 --> 00:37:39,248
Rym: we can't talk about that yet.

610
00:37:39,308 --> 00:37:40,159
Rym: We're not lovers yet.

611
00:37:40,581 --> 00:37:48,780
Rym: And then he thinks about it for a second and he wonders how the two girls would be so acquainted with each other's ways of loving.

612
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:52,780
Rym: And there's a sentence somewhere near the end of that chapter where he's basically like.

613
00:37:53,302 --> 00:38:02,018
Rym: and then the Stephen Wolf considered these brave new ramifications of the world or something like that, which is this kind of thinly veiled lesbian joke that was I found.

614
00:38:02,038 --> 00:38:03,184
Rym: I laughed out loud.

615
00:38:03,425 --> 00:38:06,442
Scott: One thing that I've noticed and I sort of have a theory about this, right.

616
00:38:07,586 --> 00:38:23,300
Scott: All the literature is that I read, you know, when I was you know, when I was in school, most of the books that I read that were highbrow or because school told me to and, you know, sexy parts were there, but not often for, you know, school politically correct bullshit reasons.

617
00:38:23,561 --> 00:38:23,801
Scott: Right.

618
00:38:24,543 --> 00:38:35,959
Scott: And I've sort of noticed that, like almost all of the highbrow books I've read in college and then since usually have some strong sexual elements to them.

619
00:38:36,762 --> 00:38:46,543
Scott: And I think pretty much like I'm getting the feeling is my theory that all the highbrow literature has strong sexual elements and that schools are basically like desperate.

620
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:50,002
Scott: They pretty much give you all the ones that don't, which is pretty much all they got.

621
00:38:50,022 --> 00:38:55,256
Scott: That's why everyone reads all the same books in high school because the only ones that are not offensive.

622
00:38:56,061 --> 00:38:59,960
Rym: Sadly, I'm very surprised that more high school.

623
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:05,023
Rym: I mean, this would be Stephen Wolf is like the perfect book to give to like a senior high school class.

624
00:39:05,064 --> 00:39:10,680
Scott: I read Siddhartha as a senior in high school, same dude, but that didn't have nearly as much sexiness in it.

625
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:11,391
Rym: I got to read that again.

626
00:39:11,411 --> 00:39:11,939
Rym: That was a good book.

627
00:39:12,201 --> 00:39:12,790
Scott: Yeah, it was good.

628
00:39:12,811 --> 00:39:13,359
Scott: I like that one.

629
00:39:13,521 --> 00:39:14,499
Scott: I like it better than this one.

630
00:39:14,802 --> 00:39:15,206
Rym: Oh, really?

631
00:39:15,569 --> 00:39:16,760
Rym: See, I got to read Demian again.

632
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,340
Rym: I don't know Demian more or not.

633
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,220
Scott: So I mean, as as something to read, to enjoy.

634
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,420
Scott: I mean, like I didn't really enjoy Stephen Wolf that much.

635
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:32,760
Scott: Like, it's not something I would read because I want to, you know, it wasn't like fun or pleasant, but I thought it both fun and pleasant.

636
00:39:33,542 --> 00:39:39,719
Scott: It was it was intellectually stimulating and it wasn't intellectually draining, which is which a lot of things are.

637
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,000
Scott: It was a book that that's a point in its favor, but it wasn't like a pleasure.

638
00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:47,461
Rym: It was a book that really forced me to analyze a lot of things about myself, to be honest.

639
00:39:47,501 --> 00:39:54,319
Rym: And while I didn't necessarily change any of my opinions, I analyzed them and I thought about a lot of kind of very personal, internal things.

640
00:39:54,983 --> 00:39:57,259
Scott: I also do that with any book that doesn't suck.

641
00:39:57,541 --> 00:40:01,280
Rym: I also I didn't analyze anything in myself when I read Hyperion.

642
00:40:02,965 --> 00:40:04,251
Rym: It was a good book, but it was.

643
00:40:04,452 --> 00:40:06,300
Rym: it was not an introspective book.

644
00:40:06,381 --> 00:40:07,898
Rym: It was an extrospective book.

645
00:40:09,522 --> 00:40:12,839
Scott: I did a little bit when I was thinking about the the console guy.

646
00:40:14,081 --> 00:40:23,598
Rym: Yeah, anyway, no, the only inward looking thing I thought at the end of that, not to not to spoil, but when you find out who the traitor is, the first thing I thought was the fuck is wrong with me that I didn't see this guy.

647
00:40:26,084 --> 00:40:26,932
Rym: Like I just I draw.

648
00:40:26,973 --> 00:40:27,740
Rym: I sat the book down.

649
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,920
Rym: I'm like, am I that stupid?

650
00:40:29,362 --> 00:40:30,280
Rym: Am I really that stupid?

651
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:30,764
Scott: Yes.

652
00:40:31,189 --> 00:40:32,018
Rym: And yes, we all are.

653
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:32,521
Scott: All right.

654
00:40:34,105 --> 00:40:46,654
Rym: But I feel like if I had read Steppenwolf when I was younger, I might have turned out slightly differently because I was closer to being the Steppenwolf when I was younger than I am now.

655
00:40:48,881 --> 00:40:59,079
Rym: Perhaps I'm talking like if I had read this in like middle school, I would have been a slightly different person or in the very least, I think I would have become the person I am now more rapidly than I did.

656
00:41:00,143 --> 00:41:01,820
Scott: Maybe the thing is, it's weird.

657
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:11,080
Scott: It's like, you know, I've obviously consumed a great deal of media in all mediums, right, that are available to us as, you know, human beings.

658
00:41:11,781 --> 00:41:25,540
Scott: And while there is no doubt that many of them have probably changed who I am or contributed to me being the way I am today, I can't actually make a lot of like direct connections like because I read that book at that time.

659
00:41:25,661 --> 00:41:26,959
Scott: That's why I do this.

660
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,720
Scott: I can't really do any of it's weird.

661
00:41:28,901 --> 00:41:35,540
Rym: I can, but only in retrospect, like, you know, I watched Captain Tyler a long time ago and I missed a bunch of episodes and all that.

662
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,699
Rym: But I watching it again now.

663
00:41:38,341 --> 00:41:42,200
Rym: It's almost frightening to see how influential it probably was on me.

664
00:41:42,441 --> 00:41:48,900
Scott: I think that is maybe if I did like reread something that I read way back and then remembered when I read it originally.

665
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,459
Rym: I think that's what you have to do.

666
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,280
Scott: Yeah, I don't do a lot of that, though.

667
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:59,160
Scott: I try to always get something new because, you know, I try not to do repeats, especially on something as, you know, time consuming as a book.

668
00:41:59,443 --> 00:42:00,320
Rym: It's so difficult, though.

669
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,440
Scott: I mean, my coworker, this book is time consuming.

670
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:03,399
Scott: I read it in a few days.

671
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:08,160
Rym: My coworker watched some Cowboy Bebop and he was like, man, that scene.

672
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:09,320
Rym: And he started talking about a scene.

673
00:42:09,982 --> 00:42:12,680
Rym: And all I could think was I got to watch Cowboy Bebop again.

674
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,500
Rym: Jesus Christ.

675
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:17,783
Scott: I started rewatching it again like some months ago, but then I stopped before I finished it.

676
00:42:18,026 --> 00:42:19,298
Rym: I think I'm going to rewatch it again.

677
00:42:20,245 --> 00:42:21,260
Scott: I already did that recently.

678
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:23,339
Scott: I watched the whole thing on the train some months ago.

679
00:42:24,482 --> 00:42:26,500
Scott: Anything else you got to say about Der Steppenwolf?

680
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:27,357
Rym: Murder car.

681
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,366
Scott: Murder car.

682
00:42:29,386 --> 00:42:33,104
Scott: That was that was I think, you know, I said the book was unpleasant, you know, well, not.

683
00:42:33,407 --> 00:42:34,639
Scott: but, you know, wasn't really fun.

684
00:42:35,422 --> 00:42:47,120
Scott: The part at the end with all the doors and the murder cars and all that, that was probably the most enjoyable part, other than the very, very introductory part where it wasn't the step before you actually read the Steppenwolf's memoirs themselves.

685
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,597
Rym: Each of the doors, I was fat.

686
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:57,278
Rym: I felt like I identified with him one last time where I I desperately wanted to enter several of the doors that he did not enter.

687
00:42:58,202 --> 00:43:02,959
Rym: And I was kind of pissed off that he entered murder car, of all things, because there were better doors than murder car.

688
00:43:03,561 --> 00:43:10,920
Scott: Well, you could tell that like he was, you know, sort of still resisting, you know, you know, look at the whole metaphor, the the room with the chess pieces.

689
00:43:12,061 --> 00:43:19,220
Rym: And he got them out and he kept wanting to use the chess pieces and make worlds and make lives and rearrange everything.

690
00:43:19,785 --> 00:43:21,580
Rym: But he kept getting distracted by all the other doors.

691
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:22,779
Rym: And then eventually it was too late.

692
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:23,343
Rym: Yep.

693
00:43:24,692 --> 00:43:25,920
Rym: That was a important part.

694
00:43:26,381 --> 00:43:28,439
Rym: Also, the have every girl door.

695
00:43:29,745 --> 00:43:31,120
Scott: I would have just stayed in that one forever.

696
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:35,399
Rym: But that was that was I think that was one of the most powerful parts of the book.

697
00:43:36,101 --> 00:43:42,901
Scott: Just that, you know, as I wondered, I mean, which dude does not have pretty much all that.

698
00:43:43,282 --> 00:43:43,583
Scott: Right.

699
00:43:43,844 --> 00:43:51,079
Scott: It's like there is not a guy, a human, a man on earth who cannot identify with that door and what happens beyond it.

700
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:52,023
Scott: Not one.

701
00:43:52,084 --> 00:43:53,640
Rym: But think about the moral of that door.

702
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:57,459
Rym: The moral of that is basically Courage Wolf.

703
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:03,380
Rym: The moral of that door is literally Luke Morgan's ask every girl out.

704
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:04,519
Rym: Don't be a pussy.

705
00:44:05,241 --> 00:44:05,805
Scott: That's true.

706
00:44:05,825 --> 00:44:07,900
Rym: That's kind of the moral of the book.

707
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,884
Rym: I mean, really, if you break it down, I mean, there are a lot of higher morals and there's a complex.

708
00:44:11,904 --> 00:44:18,420
Scott: And I'm sure, you know, according to the dude who is all scholarly, he's like, yeah, nobody really understands this book on their first go.

709
00:44:18,481 --> 00:44:19,679
Scott: So we're probably totally wrong.

710
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,479
Rym: It's a complicated book and it says a lot.

711
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:27,020
Rym: But I think complicated man, the core understands the core moral of the book.

712
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:34,489
Rym: to break it down into a very, very simple and possibly vulgar vernacular is do drugs at least once in your life.

713
00:44:34,751 --> 00:44:35,519
Rym: Don't be a pussy.

714
00:44:35,941 --> 00:44:36,485
Rym: Live a little.

715
00:44:36,808 --> 00:44:38,057
Rym: Have an orgy at least once.

716
00:44:39,762 --> 00:44:40,385
Rym: I'm not kidding.

717
00:44:40,405 --> 00:44:42,820
Rym: Like it's basically a just live your life.

718
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:44,620
Rym: Listen to the music through the static.

719
00:44:44,821 --> 00:44:46,100
Rym: Don't worry about the static.

720
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:47,352
Rym: Do the best you can.

721
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:47,960
Rym: Don't be a pussy.

722
00:44:48,224 --> 00:44:49,360
Rym: Seriously, don't be a pussy.

723
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,005
Rym: Good God.

724
00:44:50,308 --> 00:44:51,419
Rym: Just don't be a pussy.

725
00:44:53,882 --> 00:44:55,539
Rym: Don't strive for things that don't exist.

726
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:57,743
Scott: Dance.

727
00:44:58,276 --> 00:44:58,440
Scott: Yeah.

728
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:02,200
Scott: Learning to dance is like a large, large portion of the book.

729
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:05,379
Rym: It was a good metaphor to notice how it culminated in a dance.

730
00:45:05,801 --> 00:45:06,042
Scott: Yep.

731
00:45:07,328 --> 00:45:09,859
Scott: Incredibly long and multi-dance.

732
00:45:10,141 --> 00:45:10,362
Rym: Yep.

733
00:45:10,543 --> 00:45:15,145
Scott: I like that one part of the dance where like, you know, the one girl's like, oh, you're you suck.

734
00:45:15,185 --> 00:45:19,559
Scott: And then later she's like, whoa, you don't suck anymore because he transformed just by getting in.

735
00:45:19,921 --> 00:45:24,199
Rym: Well, actually, that's my going into hell because, you know, I'm back.

736
00:45:24,904 --> 00:45:26,179
Scott: I'm sure you've had again.

737
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:31,060
Rym: And I know a lot of people experience this and part of that's why I think people identify with the Steppenwolf.

738
00:45:31,901 --> 00:45:45,420
Rym: He's at like the concert when he sees all the people around him, like enraptured by the concert or like he sees that he has this impression of other people, that they are fully engaged by the concert, by the music.

739
00:45:45,683 --> 00:45:46,471
Rym: They're dancing.

740
00:45:46,511 --> 00:45:47,340
Rym: They're enjoying themselves.

741
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:48,124
Rym: They're doing whatever.

742
00:45:48,827 --> 00:45:52,767
Rym: But he is distracted in his own mind and he can't lose himself in the music.

743
00:45:52,807 --> 00:45:54,520
Rym: He's thinking about all these other things.

744
00:45:55,144 --> 00:45:56,480
Rym: And as a result, he feels a part.

745
00:45:56,881 --> 00:45:59,500
Rym: All those other people are drawn into this thing.

746
00:45:59,581 --> 00:46:00,250
Rym: And I am not.

747
00:46:00,392 --> 00:46:01,000
Rym: I'm the Steppenwolf.

748
00:46:01,301 --> 00:46:01,563
Rym: I am.

749
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:03,420
Rym: He's thinking about all these other things.

750
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:08,000
Rym: He can't be drawn in and he feels like he's missing out and he doesn't know why.

751
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:08,804
Rym: And it bothers him.

752
00:46:08,864 --> 00:46:11,500
Scott: And he just and he starts thinking about it.

753
00:46:11,601 --> 00:46:12,630
Scott: Why am I missing out?

754
00:46:12,892 --> 00:46:13,780
Scott: And that doesn't help you.

755
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,160
Scott: That's basically just going the opposite direction.

756
00:46:15,561 --> 00:46:17,200
Rym: I'm sure you felt that you're at a concert.

757
00:46:17,903 --> 00:46:24,200
Rym: But you get the the matter where you start thinking after the concert, what do I do where I should move my arms in the air?

758
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:28,920
Scott: Well, I mean, a lot of people have problems like that, like they can't go to sleep because they just keep thinking about shit or like lately.

759
00:46:29,381 --> 00:46:33,483
Scott: I just been thinking about all this shit I got to do for moving and I can't like do other stuff.

760
00:46:33,664 --> 00:46:37,282
Rym: But look, the the only time in this whole book, well, one of the only times.

761
00:46:37,382 --> 00:46:38,106
Rym: Well, no, the only

762
00:46:38,166 --> 00:46:39,854
Scott: time you're drowning in your thinking

763
00:46:40,216 --> 00:47:01,340
Rym: when he's happy, really, are when he just gives in and actually is able to enjoy what he is doing for what he is doing without worrying about the details of what he is doing and without trying to ascribe whatever he's doing to some higher purpose when he loses himself and making love to Maria, when he loses himself at the ball at the end.

764
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:03,900
Rym: Those are the only times he loses himself.

765
00:47:04,041 --> 00:47:07,100
Rym: And he's not like he becomes stupid or like literally loses his mind.

766
00:47:07,761 --> 00:47:10,417
Rym: He just gives in and doesn't.

767
00:47:11,423 --> 00:47:11,687
Rym: Yeah.

768
00:47:12,417 --> 00:47:12,559
Scott: Yeah.

769
00:47:13,001 --> 00:47:20,520
Scott: Also, I just sort of say, you know, he gets those, you know, there's that theater and it's like not for everyone for Mad Men only.

770
00:47:20,741 --> 00:47:21,223
Scott: Oh, shit.

771
00:47:21,464 --> 00:47:24,940
Scott: You know, and that's sort of like mysterious kind of shit like that.

772
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,267
Scott: Like, I love that kind of action.

773
00:47:26,448 --> 00:47:28,680
Scott: Like what was that Schwarzenegger movie?

774
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:29,785
Scott: Last Action Hero.

775
00:47:30,427 --> 00:47:33,260
Scott: Ah, where they go like that mysterious movie theater.

776
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:34,710
Scott: You know, you know all that.

777
00:47:34,791 --> 00:47:35,900
Scott: I love that kind of shit.

778
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:37,007
Rym: I'll say straight up.

779
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:39,039
Rym: That was a pretty good movie for what it was.

780
00:47:39,684 --> 00:47:39,785
Scott: Yeah.

781
00:47:39,805 --> 00:47:40,840
Scott: I just I just, you know, whatever.

782
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:43,199
Scott: There's that sort of like mysterious crap like that.

783
00:47:43,641 --> 00:47:44,634
Scott: Like, I like that.

784
00:47:45,642 --> 00:47:46,912
Rym: Oh, we didn't even get to talk about it.

785
00:47:47,234 --> 00:47:47,940
Rym: I don't want to get into it.

786
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:55,440
Rym: We've already gone on a while, but the whole thing about the bourgeois and just the whole, you know, the comfortable people never accomplish anything.

787
00:47:55,480 --> 00:48:02,220
Rym: They're always torn between two worlds, the the very poor and the very rich and the adventure and all the all the ways that you can be forced to live life.

788
00:48:02,341 --> 00:48:13,000
Rym: And then like the the middle class of mind, life is the worst one because you can't you're not ever shaken up and you basically live this comfortable, precarious existence forever.

789
00:48:13,321 --> 00:48:14,799
Rym: The clean doorstep and all that.

790
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,719
Rym: And there's a lot to say about that, but we've gone on long enough.

791
00:48:17,981 --> 00:48:18,203
Rym: Yep.

792
00:48:19,255 --> 00:48:19,699
Scott: All righty.

793
00:48:19,841 --> 00:48:21,060
Rym: So what's the next book?

794
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,057
Scott: We can do things of the day.

795
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:22,785
Rym: There's Scott.

796
00:48:22,826 --> 00:48:23,008
Rym: Yeah.

797
00:48:24,583 --> 00:48:24,945
Scott: All right.

798
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:26,900
Scott: So no things the day to day.

799
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:27,658
Scott: This is going to be weird.

800
00:48:28,462 --> 00:48:29,326
Scott: The next book.

801
00:48:29,567 --> 00:48:34,698
Scott: Well, OK, so the goal of the book club is to get people to fucking read.

802
00:48:34,798 --> 00:48:35,020
Scott: Right.

803
00:48:35,301 --> 00:48:36,632
Rym: I suggested The Little Prince.

804
00:48:37,015 --> 00:48:37,600
Scott: That's a good one.

805
00:48:37,741 --> 00:48:38,309
Scott: We'll do that next.

806
00:48:38,431 --> 00:48:38,978
Scott: Right.

807
00:48:40,581 --> 00:48:44,879
Scott: So I'm trying to think what book is going to get people to read.

808
00:48:45,222 --> 00:48:47,317
Scott: So I'm like, aha, I know what we'll get people to read.

809
00:48:47,539 --> 00:48:47,740
Scott: Right.

810
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:52,237
Scott: You can't come out with like some book they never heard of because then they might not want to read it.

811
00:48:52,257 --> 00:48:52,540
Scott: Right.

812
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:55,879
Rym: You might have to come up with a book that everyone's heard of, but no one's read.

813
00:48:56,381 --> 00:49:00,600
Scott: Well, the thing is, it's not a but I didn't come up with one that everyone's heard of, but no one's read.

814
00:49:01,102 --> 00:49:05,800
Scott: I came up with one that everyone's heard of, but probably not everyone's read.

815
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:06,661
Scott: Right.

816
00:49:06,943 --> 00:49:09,120
Scott: At least I haven't read it in like a bajillion years.

817
00:49:09,781 --> 00:49:14,420
Scott: And once, like, you know, like they hear it and we give them an excuse.

818
00:49:15,061 --> 00:49:18,060
Scott: There's like they're going to be like, oh, you can't I got to read it.

819
00:49:18,161 --> 00:49:19,073
Scott: How could I not?

820
00:49:19,336 --> 00:49:19,579
Scott: Right.

821
00:49:20,761 --> 00:49:21,913
Scott: So the book.

822
00:49:22,439 --> 00:49:22,560
Scott: Right.

823
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:29,879
Scott: And I also I wanted to pick one that would be, you know, sort of fun and entertaining and not so heavy and intellectual and brainy.

824
00:49:30,101 --> 00:49:37,259
Scott: You know, that way, you know, everyone could sort of get into it and, you know, not like shy away from something that might be all schoolish.

825
00:49:39,563 --> 00:49:42,660
Scott: And also I wanted to get something that be relatively short and easy to read.

826
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:44,139
Scott: I went, you know, I'm like, what?

827
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:48,539
Scott: There couldn't possibly be a better book, at least not within like.

828
00:49:48,619 --> 00:49:53,586
Scott: after I thought of it like a couple of weeks ago, I could not think of any possible better book club.

829
00:49:53,626 --> 00:49:55,760
Scott: pick for a show called GeekNights.

830
00:49:56,322 --> 00:49:56,585
Scott: All right.

831
00:49:56,867 --> 00:49:58,379
Scott: And you still have no idea what it is, dude.

832
00:49:59,403 --> 00:50:01,339
Rym: Maybe one of those chocolate war kind of books.

833
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:02,659
Scott: No, not even close.

834
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:07,800
Scott: OK, the book we are going to read is you're in the right.

835
00:50:09,044 --> 00:50:09,730
Scott: No, OK.

836
00:50:09,952 --> 00:50:10,760
Scott: Not that one either.

837
00:50:11,463 --> 00:50:13,840
Scott: It is the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

838
00:50:15,581 --> 00:50:20,858
Scott: Now, they they have a like a huge mega deluxe editions that have like all the books in it.

839
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:21,240
Scott: Right.

840
00:50:21,681 --> 00:50:27,119
Scott: I am only assigning you kiddies the very first original Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy book.

841
00:50:27,605 --> 00:50:28,071
Rym: All right.

842
00:50:28,294 --> 00:50:28,720
Rym: A little hint.

843
00:50:29,221 --> 00:50:32,500
Rym: A lot of people probably have not actually read these this book or any of them.

844
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:35,860
Rym: What I will recommend is that, like Scott said, you're brilliant.

845
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:40,820
Rym: This is your excuse to read them and never let anyone know your dark secret.

846
00:50:41,102 --> 00:50:41,404
Scott: Right.

847
00:50:41,767 --> 00:50:43,300
Scott: I haven't read it since like forever.

848
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:44,879
Scott: I barely remember half of it.

849
00:50:46,044 --> 00:50:49,059
Rym: So I remember listening to radio dramas of it.

850
00:50:49,381 --> 00:50:49,602
Scott: Yeah.

851
00:50:49,683 --> 00:50:55,699
Scott: I remember there's the radio drama and there's the more recent movie that I never saw, but I saw the trailer radio drama, which is brilliantly.

852
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:56,505
Rym: voice acted good.

853
00:50:56,526 --> 00:50:56,929
Rym: Yeah.

854
00:50:57,293 --> 00:50:58,020
Rym: Anyway, quick.

855
00:50:58,161 --> 00:50:58,552
Rym: They're coming.

856
00:50:58,635 --> 00:50:58,820
Rym: Nobody.

857
00:50:59,261 --> 00:51:02,340
Scott: So everyone go on Amazon buy a link.

858
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:13,740
Scott: I'm going to link to like the the mega deluxe edition that includes like all this stuff and also link to just, you know, the original book by itself with nothing extra added.

859
00:51:14,524 --> 00:51:15,980
Scott: And that's all we're going to talk about.

860
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:17,720
Scott: We're only going to talk about the very first book.

861
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:22,327
Scott: We're not going to talk about, you know, like freaking Sammons of Doubt or any shit like that.

862
00:51:22,427 --> 00:51:22,649
Scott: Right.

863
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:24,060
Scott: So keep that to yourself.

864
00:51:30,381 --> 00:51:32,480
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

865
