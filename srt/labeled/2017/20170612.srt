00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,443
Rym: It's Monday June 12th 2017.

2
00:00:12,443 --> 00:00:13,106
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,267 --> 00:00:15,296
Rym: Okay, and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:15,637 --> 00:00:24,040
Rym: It is like 95 degrees out and we're talking about that guy who deleted his production database at work and got fired and how.

5
00:00:24,222 --> 00:00:28,938
Rym: That's not his fault Let's do this.

6
00:00:31,761 --> 00:00:43,020
Rym: So I haven't biked to work in a while because it's been cold and rainy and also I've had a lot of meetings where I Was still fighting with my work to let me bring my bike in them.

7
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,760
Rym: I filed all the paperwork in my building finally was like god damn it and they just let me my building doesn't give a shit.

8
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,980
Scott: My building's been foreclosed on and like no one cares.

9
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,427
Scott: I saw people bringing them on the other.

10
00:00:51,447 --> 00:00:55,489
Scott: there's only one of their tenant and they were just bringing him in the Regular old elevator.

11
00:00:55,529 --> 00:00:56,617
Rym: make a deal with that other tenant.

12
00:00:56,637 --> 00:00:58,848
Rym: be like yo I'll pay you like a five bucks if you.

13
00:00:58,868 --> 00:01:00,114
Rym: let me just leave your bike in your place.

14
00:01:00,395 --> 00:01:01,944
Scott: Oh, that's not the worst idea I'm.

15
00:01:01,965 --> 00:01:10,540
Rym: that's what I would try my old company I. actually a big part of why I quit was that they wouldn't let me bring my bike into the office And I was kind of looking to quit anyway.

16
00:01:11,826 --> 00:01:13,092
Scott: But it's like I can't.

17
00:01:13,172 --> 00:01:14,820
Scott: there is no better job out there.

18
00:01:14,921 --> 00:01:16,200
Scott: Otherwise I would have left, you know.

19
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,738
Scott: But I've been here for eight years because people call me up all the time and their jobs aren't better.

20
00:01:20,758 --> 00:01:23,631
Rym: Yep It's uh, I've gotten some.

21
00:01:23,651 --> 00:01:24,495
Scott: there was a better job.

22
00:01:24,555 --> 00:01:25,600
Scott: I'd go but there isn't one.

23
00:01:25,801 --> 00:01:27,330
Rym: I've had a few that were definitely.

24
00:01:27,411 --> 00:01:30,706
Scott: I can't quit over something small like you're not letting me keep my bike enough.

25
00:01:30,886 --> 00:01:40,378
Rym: the ones that were better though recently are either very high risk of Disappearing, you know how those things go or Were jobs that?

26
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,726
Rym: They're better in every way except.

27
00:01:42,826 --> 00:01:44,353
Scott: I don't want someone said they can't hear me.

28
00:01:44,976 --> 00:01:45,860
Rym: That's fixed long ago.

29
00:01:46,201 --> 00:01:48,207
Rym: Okay, so it's because I muted it.

30
00:01:48,468 --> 00:01:51,919
Rym: when I plug it unplug your microphone to prevent a pop and I forgot to unmute it.

31
00:01:52,281 --> 00:01:52,645
Scott: There's not.

32
00:01:52,685 --> 00:01:54,180
Scott: it might have broken because he dropped it on the floor.

33
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,620
Rym: Nope, there is a pipeline that goes through the compressor to here and there's a separate pipeline that goes in here.

34
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,724
Rym: There's all these pipelines.

35
00:02:00,045 --> 00:02:01,732
Rym: It's like a complicated situation here.

36
00:02:02,174 --> 00:02:05,686
Rym: if we had that patreon level I'll do a video explaining how all this is set up.

37
00:02:06,007 --> 00:02:08,133
Rym: Mm-hmm, but I digress really come.

38
00:02:08,716 --> 00:02:23,631
Rym: Ah, I Could make it way more complicated if I wanted to make it unnecessary But yeah, it's super hot out and over the weekend be Emily and her friend Phil actually ran the Brooklyn pride 5k race and you didn't win because you slow.

39
00:02:24,033 --> 00:02:28,908
Rym: so the winner in my age group got a time Actually, it was only like 18 or so minutes.

40
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:31,816
Rym: I think okay and overall was like 17 minutes.

41
00:02:31,896 --> 00:02:32,678
Scott: What was your minutes?

42
00:02:32,678 --> 00:02:33,885
Scott: 21?

43
00:02:33,885 --> 00:02:41,240
Scott: So here are three minutes slow Yeah, so the person crossed the finish line and then we counted to a hundred and eighty and then ran across the finish line.

44
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,212
Rym: yep, so I'm not gonna win these things because winning times on most of the five.

45
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:52,460
Scott: you think about running a hundred like just go Outside and run and count, you know set a timer for three minutes and see how far you run in three minutes.

46
00:02:52,943 --> 00:02:53,668
Scott: That's how far.

47
00:02:53,768 --> 00:03:07,536
Rym: so I looked up the best 5k I've ever run because I actually have records of all this ever like a race a formal race where Someone with a real system gave me a real like formal time the best one I ran was exactly 20 minutes and some milliseconds.

48
00:03:07,798 --> 00:03:07,958
Rym: Mm-hmm.

49
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,429
Rym: And so that's that's running like six and a half minute miles.

50
00:03:11,449 --> 00:03:17,980
Rym: ish That was three years ago and I feel like I will never do better than that again in the rest of my life.

51
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:18,823
Scott: See I did.

52
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:26,339
Scott: my plan actually right was oh if you didn't get the flat tire If I didn't have the flat tire is I was gonna cuz I didn't realize until I got there.

53
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:29,160
Scott: See my my original plan was just to leave and go to the barbecue.

54
00:03:29,341 --> 00:03:32,380
Rym: Oh, you're gonna follow and like get a video of me be huffing and puffing and being sweaty.

55
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,820
Scott: I maybe waited the finish line, but because I had the flat tire I went to the finish line.

56
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,500
Scott: So but but the thing is once I realized that I thought the whole circle would be closed.

57
00:03:41,941 --> 00:03:43,507
Scott: When I realized it wasn't closed.

58
00:03:43,587 --> 00:03:46,437
Scott: I was like, oh, maybe we'll do some little Mac.

59
00:03:46,597 --> 00:03:50,299
Scott: Yeah uh-huh, and I would just go and like, you know, I would try to like.

60
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,860
Scott: You know go at a bad taste like mess you up and make you get all tired and fall over.

61
00:03:55,141 --> 00:03:56,005
Rym: So you missed it.

62
00:03:56,266 --> 00:03:58,978
Rym: actually it's a shame that didn't happen because did you vomit again?

63
00:03:58,998 --> 00:03:59,359
Rym: I vomited.

64
00:04:01,461 --> 00:04:04,352
Scott: So basically I even yelled at the beginning of the race don't vomit.

65
00:04:04,492 --> 00:04:06,560
Scott: and I realized I didn't say Rym don't.

66
00:04:07,862 --> 00:04:10,835
Scott: I'm like, wow, everyone else is really wondering why I yelled that.

67
00:04:11,056 --> 00:04:18,320
Rym: so it's a common thing Like a lot of people vomit after like significant running races more more like 10 K's or marathons, but or half marathons.

68
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:22,375
Rym: But basically it was real Ozone and pretty hot and there's a hill.

69
00:04:22,636 --> 00:04:23,198
Scott: It wasn't that bad.

70
00:04:23,238 --> 00:04:23,740
Scott: That was a good day.

71
00:04:24,203 --> 00:04:29,719
Rym: I mean it was way better than like today But the Ozone was like 85 ish during the race.

72
00:04:30,302 --> 00:04:38,388
Rym: So like everyone like all of us like the times across the board were slower than like people would probably get on a nicer day And also that hill like I don't train on hills at all.

73
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:40,575
Scott: Usually but the baby hill.

74
00:04:41,136 --> 00:04:46,100
Rym: to avoid the crowd I started near the front and I tried to follow not the front.

75
00:04:46,201 --> 00:04:47,416
Scott: I did see you at the start.

76
00:04:47,456 --> 00:04:52,880
Scott: you were Nearish they were near the front than you should have been and you were trying harder than it looked like you should have tried.

77
00:04:52,960 --> 00:05:04,255
Rym: No, my only goal was to get ahead of the main body so I didn't have to deal with people and to not keep up with the front runners because those are people who are like Professional runners like those are people who are shooting for a 16-minute Mm-hmm.

78
00:05:04,601 --> 00:05:09,380
Rym: I wanted to keep up with the people who are one group behind that Mmm, and I kept up with them.

79
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:14,440
Rym: Like I picked a guy and I was like I'm following him because he looks pro and he's like he's keeping a pace.

80
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,720
Rym: I'm gonna follow his exact pace because I don't keep good paces when I buy myself.

81
00:05:18,362 --> 00:05:31,260
Rym: And I kept up with him until the two and a half mile mark and then he slowed started disappearing in the distance And then I pushed to try to catch up and I pushed a little too hard and I vom.

82
00:05:31,381 --> 00:05:49,079
Rym: I basically there's this but there's a woman at the end like taking photos like a really nice camera Mm-hmm, and I'm running and I see the camera come up but she's gonna take a picture of me and I immediately turn my head to the left and just Explode exploded vomited behind me And then I turned right and just kept running and I saw her like bring the camera down like what the fuck.

83
00:05:50,341 --> 00:05:51,324
Rym: And it was real funny.

84
00:05:51,344 --> 00:05:57,300
Rym: and then anyone else vomiting, uh, I saw a couple other people vomit after they cross the finish line.

85
00:05:58,623 --> 00:05:59,610
Rym: Not a ton of people though.

86
00:05:59,631 --> 00:06:02,365
Scott: Mm-hmm Really do something about this.

87
00:06:02,425 --> 00:06:07,140
Rym: Yeah, you know what I should do about that either not push myself that hard or actually train.

88
00:06:08,544 --> 00:06:11,563
Rym: I've been training much lately but anyway I digress.

89
00:06:11,603 --> 00:06:16,990
Rym: races are fun and just a hobby of mine and this guy came out and hung out and then we didn't go to The pride parade because it was actually at night.

90
00:06:17,151 --> 00:06:18,499
Scott: I did so much stuff on Saturday.

91
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:19,605
Scott: first I went to that race.

92
00:06:19,766 --> 00:06:21,054
Scott: Yeah, and I had a flat tire.

93
00:06:21,115 --> 00:06:23,854
Rym: went to the bike shop Yeah, then you found the nice bike shot.

94
00:06:23,874 --> 00:06:24,640
Rym: You went to do bike shop.

95
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,125
Scott: Well that I went well, the one was closed.

96
00:06:26,145 --> 00:06:33,310
Scott: then I went to the barbecue and then I went to the mural project And then on Sunday, I live streamed all those things.

97
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:36,280
Scott: So if you followed my youtube channel, you could have seen all those things.

98
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,164
Scott: They're still there I guess.

99
00:06:37,585 --> 00:06:39,132
Scott: and then on Sunday.

100
00:06:39,152 --> 00:06:40,899
Scott: I just went to the barbecue.

101
00:06:41,361 --> 00:06:43,733
Scott: Yeah, I did less but I still did plenty.

102
00:06:43,753 --> 00:06:45,140
Rym: Yeah, well sunny went to the barbecue.

103
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:49,980
Rym: We hung out in the park for a while eating barbecue and chillin and then we played some board games and did some stuff.

104
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:53,340
Rym: It was a good weekend all told had some friends out.

105
00:06:53,763 --> 00:06:54,390
Rym: Now I got to do it.

106
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:55,480
Rym: I got to finish a bunch of kinetic.

107
00:06:55,621 --> 00:06:58,195
Rym: I got a lot of work to do in the next like couple weeks and I gotta go to London.

108
00:06:58,336 --> 00:07:04,759
Rym: So, uh, Mmm, uh, yeah two weeks from now there won't be shows cuz I'll be in London pretty much all week.

109
00:07:05,722 --> 00:07:06,370
Scott: Good luck with that.

110
00:07:06,511 --> 00:07:07,199
Scott: They got problems.

111
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:09,349
Rym: Nothing that look like me.

112
00:07:09,974 --> 00:07:14,200
Rym: I'm just saying Scott a lot of the places I go have had attacks like that.

113
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:20,806
Scott: In fact, like well, I'm not talking about that Like what Exedy problems.

114
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:22,033
Rym: Oh, yeah.

115
00:07:22,556 --> 00:07:28,627
Rym: Yeah That the the brexit stuff actually doesn't affect me that much not yet And most of what I'm just so.

116
00:07:28,647 --> 00:07:45,160
Rym: it's funny because what I'm doing there is I'm going to a convention where I'm on a panel about Miffed - which is this European regulation that Affects the UK now, but might not affect the UK after brexit, but Europe might force them to do it.

117
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,122
Rym: Anyway, they won't build it.

118
00:07:46,403 --> 00:07:47,366
Rym: There's actually a pretty.

119
00:07:47,386 --> 00:07:48,067
Rym: it's.

120
00:07:48,549 --> 00:07:57,417
Rym: it's somewhat funny that I'm on a panel about Miffed - in London While brexit is in the process of potentially happening.

121
00:07:57,437 --> 00:07:57,778
Rym: Mm-hmm.

122
00:07:58,521 --> 00:08:06,233
Rym: so in the news Scott you sent me this link and we both read it and it's just sort of a Can I'm not gonna vouch for like all the reporting in this?

123
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:07,839
Scott: Yeah, it's just some guys blog.

124
00:08:07,999 --> 00:08:11,473
Rym: Yep But I've stumbled across this blog multiple times in the past.

125
00:08:11,513 --> 00:08:12,196
Rym: It's always been pretty.

126
00:08:12,276 --> 00:08:25,447
Scott: Okay, so The story here Scott sent me the link is basically talking about like usually you read an article right and an article has like one fit like one bomb it drops and like has one quote pull that like You know pull quote that is like.

127
00:08:25,567 --> 00:08:28,921
Scott: that tells you what the big deal is and all the rest of it is just filler words Right.

128
00:08:28,961 --> 00:08:33,655
Scott: Yeah, this one is just dropping bombs and like every paragraph like oh shit.

129
00:08:34,076 --> 00:08:34,496
Scott: Oh shit.

130
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:35,480
Scott: Oh, that's what's going down.

131
00:08:36,446 --> 00:08:43,178
Rym: I recommend actually if you listen to GeekNights Monday Just go to this page and read this article because we're not gonna read it to you.

132
00:08:44,105 --> 00:08:45,640
Rym: And there's a lot of fascinating stuff.

133
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:45,780
Rym: But

134
00:08:45,800 --> 00:09:12,158
Scott: it basically tells this story about you know, Microsoft and Intel right being dependent on each other But also competing with each other trying to like gain dominance in this sort of partnered relationship, right and in doing so Right locking in the backwards compatibility of you know Wintel platform all the way back to the earliest x86 code Nope, and how time and time again people tried to bust in there, but couldn't bust in.

135
00:09:12,178 --> 00:09:14,647
Scott: they could you know No one from the outside could attack them.

136
00:09:14,707 --> 00:09:14,948
Scott: right.

137
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:20,948
Scott: but Nvidia, you know has finally, you know Going to succeed in the near future right.

138
00:09:21,009 --> 00:09:30,345
Scott: and all the really fascinating stuff is when it talks about the different technological decisions made by all these companies for Competitive reasons.

139
00:09:30,707 --> 00:09:34,280
Scott: right like aha Intel didn't put too many PCI Express.

140
00:09:34,521 --> 00:09:43,980
Scott: That's the one I was gonna bring up on the chipset because then that would mean that you know Nvidia Things could be so fast that you wouldn't care about the Intel stuff anymore.

141
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,328
Scott: All right, or you know, oh they didn't.

142
00:09:46,408 --> 00:09:49,840
Scott: you know Intel was trying to virtualize all of Windows at one point.

143
00:09:50,141 --> 00:09:56,280
Scott: So that way, you know Windows could be disposed of and you could just run your code on Intel stuff directly.

144
00:09:56,561 --> 00:10:06,489
Scott: There's an example on a nerd like a current like i7 Intel and Microsoft made DirectX in order to you know Prevent Intel from doing that and so and so.

145
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:09,037
Rym: but you'll get like 16 PCI Express lanes.

146
00:10:10,587 --> 00:10:17,120
Rym: So if you have one video card I'll use all 16. if you got to One of them will use eight and the other one will use eight or like eight and four.

147
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:17,722
Rym: There's all these.

148
00:10:18,164 --> 00:10:20,635
Rym: if you buy an expensive one, you might get 20 lanes.

149
00:10:20,655 --> 00:10:21,940
Rym: Like I think my mother bird is 20.

150
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:33,978
Scott: It's like a video card and the PCIe SSD it also talks about like Intel put those GPUs in the CPUs because that way Only super gamers would but would put Nvidia equipment in yep.

151
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,705
Scott: So you're locking normal.

152
00:10:35,786 --> 00:10:37,734
Scott: normal people wouldn't have that.

153
00:10:37,774 --> 00:10:39,099
Scott: so that way you couldn't build direct.

154
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:39,663
Scott: You couldn't.

155
00:10:39,704 --> 00:10:46,440
Scott: basically as software developers You couldn't build for Nvidia because people don't have it because only the super gamers have it.

156
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:57,020
Rym: They're all normal people have integrate integrated Intel stuff Which really puts into light the idea that Kaby Lake that you're the next Intel chipset has native support for 4k and like video stuff.

157
00:10:57,201 --> 00:10:59,609
Scott: But it's like basically all of this stuff is.

158
00:10:59,869 --> 00:11:03,080
Scott: you're just trying to get this competition for developers, right?

159
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:16,900
Scott: They want people to write software in a certain way because if software runs on their platforms Then they sell their platforms and if developers start writing software that runs on a different platform People don't need their platform anymore, right?

160
00:11:17,282 --> 00:11:19,980
Scott: So that that's what happens when you make an operating system or hardware.

161
00:11:20,081 --> 00:11:21,228
Scott: You need people you need.

162
00:11:21,369 --> 00:11:28,540
Scott: the most thing you need the most is Developers writing software for your shit because if that's what really sells products people don't aren't buying.

163
00:11:28,902 --> 00:11:30,990
Scott: You know Wintel because they like it.

164
00:11:31,011 --> 00:11:33,140
Scott: they're buying it because Photoshop runs on it.

165
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:36,772
Rym: Yeah, and it also runs on Mac, but Macs are super underpowered.

166
00:11:37,073 --> 00:11:38,578
Scott: Right, but that's also even Intel.

167
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:41,340
Rym: Yeah I didn't tell what is the different platform?

168
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:49,900
Scott: But if the software that people want to run runs on something else if it runs on a hundred percent Nvidia equipment They're not gonna buy no Intel garbo.

169
00:11:50,421 --> 00:11:52,086
Rym: The only problem is like it's talking about.

170
00:11:52,146 --> 00:12:01,880
Rym: GPUs are like faster and scaling faster and all that but because they weren't hindered by the backwards compatibility in our architecture decision, but they also use a ton of power.

171
00:12:02,402 --> 00:12:07,805
Scott: That's I think that's the one thing is like, you know and generate a shit ton of heat Shocking.

172
00:12:08,108 --> 00:12:20,280
Rym: if I play overwatch And I like use OBS to like livestream it and use OBS separately to encode to my disk Like my computer gets so hot that it like it hurts my feet if they're near the exhaust because this is what happened.

173
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:29,892
Scott: Right is like, you know for a while in like the Pentium 4 era right when we were having like AMD computers that set on fire AMD was basically going the route of like the hot rod.

174
00:12:29,912 --> 00:12:31,540
Scott: like we don't care about heat generation.

175
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,672
Scott: We'll just put bigger and crazier heat sinks on there.

176
00:12:33,913 --> 00:12:35,160
Scott: You don't care about power efficiency.

177
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,973
Scott: We'll just go as fast as we can and burn all the fuel.

178
00:12:38,013 --> 00:12:39,239
Scott: fuck fuel efficiency, right?

179
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:45,160
Scott: Intel the Pentium 4 kind of did that but then they really it wasn't working too great.

180
00:12:45,421 --> 00:12:50,560
Scott: So then they were like, alright, we actually need to make CPUs that are efficient because we got laptops and things, right?

181
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:58,160
Scott: We want to not use a lot of electricity to get more battery life and we want to you know Get more processing done per unit electricity.

182
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,440
Scott: We want to be more stable and less crashy and more reliable and that was the good road to go down.

183
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:08,500
Scott: They beat AMD going on that road also using dirty business tricks that you can read about elsewhere, right?

184
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,695
Rym: And also bringing their prices down because they had their prices high because no one competed with them.

185
00:13:12,715 --> 00:13:19,170
Rym: as soon as there was a competitor suddenly Intel chips got better and cheaper right but GPUs right.

186
00:13:19,391 --> 00:13:20,880
Scott: basically never gave a fuck.

187
00:13:21,303 --> 00:13:23,620
Scott: They're just like hot rod all the way, you know.

188
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:27,260
Scott: Just stick a million fans on there and use all the power in the world.

189
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:31,139
Scott: In fact you now you have to plug in two more power cables from your power supply because we need more power.

190
00:13:31,664 --> 00:13:41,303
Scott: We don't care about power efficiency We don't care about you know, pretty much anything except getting the most possible processing power, right use all the juice He got.

191
00:13:41,343 --> 00:13:42,632
Scott: yeah, you need a 800 watt power supply.

192
00:13:42,652 --> 00:13:47,706
Scott: now I got two of these bad boys is like And that's why they're faster.

193
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:49,411
Scott: if Intel had been like we don't give a shit.

194
00:13:49,471 --> 00:13:57,155
Scott: It would be faster too, but the backwards compatibility You know also, you know didn't allow them to be as parallel as the GPUs are right.

195
00:13:57,215 --> 00:14:04,180
Scott: GPUs are crazy parallel Like you talk about like 16 cores in your CPU the GPU is like whatever I got like.

196
00:14:04,762 --> 00:14:05,644
Rym: So remember I said like.

197
00:14:05,664 --> 00:14:15,674
Rym: here's a specific example from the article in Intel like chipset and like a modern one will have 16 Maybe 20 PCI Express lanes quote here.

198
00:14:16,381 --> 00:14:35,130
Rym: IBM has also partnered with Nvidia to produce a generation of monster number crunching CPUs with the power 9 sporting 160 PCIe lanes yep instead of 16 10 X Yep, and the risin's.

199
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:41,839
Rym: I didn't know this until relatively recently Mm-hmm the AMD risin CPUs cuz they don't give a fuck about protecting Intel's x86.

200
00:14:43,701 --> 00:14:46,835
Rym: They're putting shit tons of PCIe lanes in their new chips.

201
00:14:46,976 --> 00:14:47,157
Scott: Yep.

202
00:14:47,237 --> 00:14:47,760
Scott: They got tons.

203
00:14:48,162 --> 00:14:51,822
Rym: So it's interesting that in light of all that because it's not mentioned in this article I don't think.

204
00:14:51,883 --> 00:15:03,119
Rym: but you might have seen Intel announced recently their core i9 Which as far as I can tell are just skylake chips that have more cores, they're not even the newest lake They're the previous lake.

205
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:08,745
Rym: Yeah, they're not KB like the skylake as far as I know and as far as anyone has been able to tell me Mm-hmm, so it's just.

206
00:15:09,187 --> 00:15:28,637
Scott: it's just so fascinating that a you know, we're gonna see this You know, it really makes you believe that the move away from Wintel and over to like arm plus GPUs You know and not Windows and Intel is might happen is actually happening for reals now Because people are doing less and less on desktop computers, right?

207
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:33,680
Rym: You know, everyone's using Professionals and gamers use workstations anymore, right?

208
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:38,779
Scott: You know all your self-driving cars and you're pretty much everything that's not a desktop computer.

209
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:42,999
Scott: is You know probably gonna run on some arm and video type of thing.

210
00:15:44,242 --> 00:15:52,669
Scott: But also just to see all of the technological decisions made by these companies for business competitive reasons Right is really fascinating.

211
00:15:52,789 --> 00:15:57,310
Scott: So because normal developers when you're at work You don't work for these big places making these kinds of decisions.

212
00:15:57,712 --> 00:15:59,820
Scott: You just try to make the best technological decision.

213
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,814
Scott: You can yell for the sake of just technology and saving money or whatever.

214
00:16:04,256 --> 00:16:08,516
Scott: You're not saying aha Let's make DirectX so that Intel doesn't put us out of business.

215
00:16:08,536 --> 00:16:09,240
Rym: So look at this.

216
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:33,079
Rym: there's a lot of software that could get a huge advantage from having like native GPU processing built in like say games do or Adobe stuff like Premiere does right but Adobe and game companies only developed for that stuff because they know that 100% of the people using their software at least like 90% have the Nvidia hardware because that's just what you do.

217
00:16:34,002 --> 00:16:38,560
Rym: So as a result, like they have a reason like their user base has they know the hardware is there.

218
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:44,362
Rym: It's kind of like how you can assume when you design modern software that most people are using and have a mouse plugged into their Computer.

219
00:16:44,624 --> 00:16:44,765
Rym: Mm-hmm.

220
00:16:45,147 --> 00:16:51,494
Rym: But imagine if like only weirdos use mice Then you wouldn't be making software like games wouldn't support night mice natively.

221
00:16:51,514 --> 00:16:54,667
Rym: Yep, so Total aside, but someone.

222
00:16:54,707 --> 00:16:55,691
Rym: the chat point is that they're all.

223
00:16:55,892 --> 00:16:58,040
Rym: they're all like shocked that we know who Alex Saint John is.

224
00:16:58,701 --> 00:16:59,765
Scott: I don't know who that is.

225
00:17:00,207 --> 00:17:00,890
Scott: He wrote the article.

226
00:17:01,171 --> 00:17:03,280
Scott: So it's a name I've heard but I know nothing about him.

227
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:05,435
Rym: So in the chat, there's a message here.

228
00:17:05,455 --> 00:17:10,079
Rym: I Legit, remember this article because it's the first time I remember this so clearly.

229
00:17:10,762 --> 00:17:17,000
Rym: It was on the back page of a maximum PC 18 years ago about driving a Hummer into a pond covered in freshly cut grass.

230
00:17:17,323 --> 00:17:18,380
Rym: Well, they work for Microsoft.

231
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,631
Rym: Okay, and pretty sure it's the exact same dude.

232
00:17:21,953 --> 00:17:23,640
Scott: Probably I don't I don't know anything about him.

233
00:17:23,701 --> 00:17:24,900
Scott: Is he good dude or a bad dude?

234
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:28,920
Rym: I mean I only stumble upon this blog occasionally and usually because it's linked to from slash shop.

235
00:17:29,141 --> 00:17:31,950
Scott: So, I don't know if he's good or bad dude, but he wrote a good article.

236
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,395
Scott: So yeah about technology.

237
00:17:33,736 --> 00:17:47,780
Rym: This is fascinating And if you if this if everything we if anything we just talked about touches on anything you do in your career You should at least pay attention to what's going on this space because this might be a big inflection point that's coming.

238
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:54,770
Scott: I definitely want to like, you know, it's like hey, you know, you should probably learn to write software for you know These sort of arm and video type.

239
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,118
Rym: It's such a pain in the ass.

240
00:17:56,701 --> 00:18:01,240
Scott: But if you learn my god, you learn how to write that stuff using like the Vulcan stuff, right?

241
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,700
Scott: That's probably gonna be beneficial to you if you're a job seeker.

242
00:18:05,608 --> 00:18:06,758
Rym: So the other thing is that remember?

243
00:18:07,382 --> 00:18:13,497
Rym: Intel actually has another entrenched interest because they want to push their Intel Phi programming for this.

244
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:20,020
Rym: That's like instead of GPUs to do that kind of Intel's was pushing FPGAs, right?

245
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:24,220
Rym: Uh, so they want you to use the five which I sort of like FPGAs.

246
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:38,051
Rym: But it's sort of like you'll have a like you'll have a processor here that has 68 cores and there's ways like you can run Most x86 type software on those cores with some limitations and I learned a lot of it work a while ago And then I forgot most of it because it's not like.

247
00:18:38,112 --> 00:18:39,579
Rym: I'm not developing any software on it.

248
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:48,760
Rym: But this is another situation where Intel is pushing this thing but Nvidia and others might be able to provide an alternative.

249
00:18:49,821 --> 00:18:54,140
Rym: So keep an eye on all this biz in some actual science news.

250
00:18:54,623 --> 00:19:10,139
Rym: This is a pretty like tentative study but I'm partly bringing it up because I'm biased toward it because I think that e-cigarettes are a high indicator of douchebaggery in my In my anecdotal evidence of interacting with humans who use e-cigarettes on a regular basis.

251
00:19:12,063 --> 00:19:15,478
Scott: But the thing I've noticed that you about e-cigarettes that's you know more bothersome.

252
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:18,052
Scott: actually It's like it's like a dude who used to smoke.

253
00:19:18,253 --> 00:19:19,600
Scott: He's already a bad person.

254
00:19:20,142 --> 00:19:24,417
Scott: Right is now smoking an e-cig just as regularly as they were smoking the regular sig.

255
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:27,580
Scott: It's like Alright, well, it smells less bad in the world.

256
00:19:27,781 --> 00:19:29,086
Scott: So I guess it's a little better.

257
00:19:29,387 --> 00:19:32,900
Rym: but then they start using it like in buildings instead of going out to the street.

258
00:19:33,321 --> 00:19:45,225
Scott: But the thing that bothers me I think about the e-cigarette is that you had people who would otherwise Never smoke ever right they would smoke nothing but if you like You know you'll be like a party.

259
00:19:45,245 --> 00:19:48,798
Scott: and it's like if at the party someone passed around a real cigarette.

260
00:19:48,818 --> 00:19:57,440
Scott: all these people would have Been like no, but it's on passes around an e-cigarette everyone would be like, oh, all right I've never seen anyone pass an e-cigarette around unless they were smoking marijuana.

261
00:19:57,581 --> 00:20:00,900
Scott: I'm just saying you know marijuana or otherwise, right?

262
00:20:01,421 --> 00:20:07,760
Scott: You know people who otherwise would not smoke because of vaporizers seeming to be less deadly.

263
00:20:08,422 --> 00:20:12,880
Scott: Right people who otherwise don't do it are open to doing it in certain social situations.

264
00:20:13,061 --> 00:20:13,984
Scott: They otherwise would not

265
00:20:14,044 --> 00:20:25,917
Rym: just stare like the people I see most off like it's one the people I noticed vaping Otherwise the words because a lot of people who use vapes Tend to do it discreetly and they like ghosts like they go outside just like the wood for a cigarette But they do this instead.

266
00:20:26,341 --> 00:20:32,240
Rym: So instead of smelling like ass mixed with ass they smell like light ass mixed with cotton candy or whatever, right?

267
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,765
Rym: Which is still pretty annoying.

268
00:20:33,845 --> 00:20:36,034
Scott: the point is it doesn't matter how you poison yourself.

269
00:20:36,074 --> 00:20:37,340
Scott: poisoning yourself isn't cool?

270
00:20:37,722 --> 00:20:38,870
Rym: Yeah, I mean I poison myself.

271
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:39,736
Rym: I was I'm drinking some wine.

272
00:20:39,816 --> 00:20:40,319
Scott: It's not cool.

273
00:20:41,405 --> 00:20:41,976
Rym: Wines great.

274
00:20:42,037 --> 00:20:46,489
Rym: No But the article anyway, I digress.

275
00:20:46,791 --> 00:21:07,734
Rym: the article is simply that there is some significant evidence that Irrespective of whether or not you even have nicotine in your stupid e-cigarette The substrate itself the vape juice even if you don't put anything in it if it's just unadulterated on like nothing just vape juice Causes pretty much the same DNA damage that smoking cigarettes does.

276
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,420
Scott: so this isn't about lung damage.

277
00:21:10,042 --> 00:21:15,740
Rym: It's not about you know mouth cancer or like the deleterious effects of nicotine itself, right?

278
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,085
Rym: This is just the vape.

279
00:21:17,145 --> 00:21:21,420
Scott: this is just about DNA damage only is probably just as bad.

280
00:21:22,062 --> 00:21:25,415
Scott: So I guess maybe that is cancer, but not I guess you won't get emphysema.

281
00:21:25,476 --> 00:21:28,639
Scott: probably probably I won't say I don't know but they didn't test for that.

282
00:21:29,182 --> 00:21:33,380
Scott: The point is you know people act like oh, you know you say it's like no you're still poisoning yourself.

283
00:21:33,481 --> 00:21:35,031
Scott: Don't fool yourself because the other.

284
00:21:35,131 --> 00:21:36,420
Rym: but I'm mostly annoyed with these cigarettes.

285
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:46,523
Rym: Is that a lot of people who would otherwise sort of surreptitiously or just like God have a cigarette and like well They smell like open asses when they come back to whatever it is They left to go smoke They don't like.

286
00:21:47,045 --> 00:21:50,014
Rym: they don't like smoke as performative behavior.

287
00:21:50,095 --> 00:21:56,317
Rym: the way that I see a lot of vape people doing Like vape people seem to be more and more into like big clouds of vape like hey look at me.

288
00:21:56,337 --> 00:21:57,220
Scott: I don't care about.

289
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:00,822
Scott: I don't care about the social Aspect of it.

290
00:22:00,842 --> 00:22:03,872
Rym: Oh no, but there's a high correlation between the social aspect and disbeggery.

291
00:22:03,892 --> 00:22:08,960
Scott: I don't want human beings poisoning themselves And it's not cool to poison yourself.

292
00:22:09,301 --> 00:22:12,694
Scott: And it's really upsetting if you see someone that you care about poisoning themselves.

293
00:22:12,754 --> 00:22:14,220
Scott: imagine if they were drinking real poison.

294
00:22:14,621 --> 00:22:16,568
Scott: It's like oh, they're only drinking a little bit of poison.

295
00:22:16,588 --> 00:22:18,134
Scott: So it's not bothering me so much.

296
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:19,800
Rym: Yeah, I mean I drink alcohol.

297
00:22:20,021 --> 00:22:20,804
Scott: It's not poisoning.

298
00:22:20,884 --> 00:22:23,915
Rym: It's delicious though and humans co-evolved with it for centuries.

299
00:22:23,935 --> 00:22:25,340
Scott: cocaine makes you feel real good.

300
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,286
Scott: I actually go snort something.

301
00:22:26,306 --> 00:22:27,193
Rym: Okay, it's way more data.

302
00:22:27,233 --> 00:22:28,280
Rym: I got no interest in cocaine.

303
00:22:28,762 --> 00:22:35,312
Scott: Oh, so if I'm falling off a bridge if I jump off a bridge, but I fall really slow It's got water can poison you but I still die when you drink too much water.

304
00:22:35,332 --> 00:22:35,773
Rym: You'll die.

305
00:22:35,794 --> 00:22:40,209
Scott: I'm just saying just saying Just say you also die if you don't drink anyone.

306
00:22:40,349 --> 00:22:41,995
Rym: don't go biking when there's a lot of ozone.

307
00:22:42,015 --> 00:22:42,778
Rym: That's carcinogenic.

308
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:43,300
Rym: That's poisonous.

309
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:54,882
Rym: I don't bike too much Yeah, but you know Was uh took me an extra 10 minutes cuz I was a what it was 95 degrees and just a lot of ozone in the Air.

310
00:22:54,922 --> 00:22:55,958
Rym: so I was biking a little slow.

311
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,588
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

312
00:23:04,608 --> 00:23:05,592
Rym: What do you got for me Scott?

313
00:23:05,792 --> 00:23:07,900
Scott: So there's these dudes and I lost the link to them.

314
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:08,805
Rym: I got the link here.

315
00:23:08,825 --> 00:23:10,033
Scott: All right, I forget who they are.

316
00:23:10,073 --> 00:23:10,234
Scott: What's?

317
00:23:10,274 --> 00:23:11,260
Scott: it was the guy's YouTube name?

318
00:23:14,187 --> 00:23:15,311
Scott: World War two Wendell.

319
00:23:15,351 --> 00:23:19,046
Scott: right and this guy is in Wendell ice.

320
00:23:19,126 --> 00:23:21,020
Scott: yeah, he's in Lyster England, Lychester.

321
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,745
Scott: I don't know how to pronounce it correctly.

322
00:23:22,785 --> 00:23:22,925
Scott: what.

323
00:23:23,888 --> 00:23:25,693
Scott: and there is the river soar.

324
00:23:25,954 --> 00:23:32,858
Scott: SOA are and they are doing an activity Which I had not heard of before which apparently based on YouTube recommendations is a common activity.

325
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:37,060
Scott: It's called Magnet fishing and that's you already can imagine what it is.

326
00:23:38,101 --> 00:23:40,128
Scott: Take a big-ass fucking magnet.

327
00:23:40,148 --> 00:23:41,914
Scott: They got a really big one here like one.

328
00:23:41,934 --> 00:23:45,492
Scott: That's so strong that you You know, it's really strong.

329
00:23:45,532 --> 00:23:46,558
Scott: You don't want to mess around with it.

330
00:23:47,882 --> 00:23:50,332
Rym: It was like if this was in a box in the boat and went over.

331
00:23:50,373 --> 00:23:51,980
Rym: the Titanic would have brought the Titanic up.

332
00:23:52,221 --> 00:23:57,184
Scott: Yeah, so you you tie a rope around that shit and you know The strength of the rope.

333
00:23:57,204 --> 00:23:57,405
Scott: better.

334
00:23:57,425 --> 00:24:01,602
Scott: be really strong because the magnet might just get stuck on something and you end up pulling nothing out Right.

335
00:24:01,663 --> 00:24:16,320
Scott: Yeah, you toss it in a river You move it around till it goes clunk on something metal and you yank that shit up and you see what's at the bottom of The water is a thousand times more cooler than those lame-o's walking around beaches with metal detectors.

336
00:24:16,661 --> 00:24:24,708
Scott: It's also way cooler than actual fishing because what I want was some useless ass fish From a disgusting river that you're not gonna want to eat.

337
00:24:24,788 --> 00:24:33,246
Scott: when I get a useful human-made metal object from the bottom of a river like now one but two Stolen safes safes.

338
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:36,195
Scott: That's like the most coolest thing you can find as a save.

339
00:24:36,215 --> 00:24:37,720
Scott: Yeah, what metal detector guy on the beach?

340
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,958
Scott: Would you find some coins?

341
00:24:40,601 --> 00:24:42,782
Rym: fucking safes Floral they like.

342
00:24:42,802 --> 00:24:43,886
Rym: call the police cuz one.

343
00:24:43,966 --> 00:24:47,115
Scott: Yeah, what one of them was a recently stolen safe.

344
00:24:47,516 --> 00:24:48,860
Scott: and you look at the safe.

345
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:52,838
Scott: There's like a hole blasted in the front of it and that they took all the loot out of.

346
00:24:54,305 --> 00:24:59,660
Scott: And they found like yeah It was like a recent robbery and someone who tossed the safe into the river and they found it.

347
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,357
Scott: So they called the cops to come check it out.

348
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:05,404
Scott: But yeah Maybe we should do some.

349
00:25:05,746 --> 00:25:09,200
Scott: is it legal to magnet fish in like the East River looks like a lot of people are doing it.

350
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,019
Rym: I just googled for magnet fishing East River.

351
00:25:12,301 --> 00:25:14,250
Rym: Magnet fishing best finds from the river.

352
00:25:14,271 --> 00:25:15,617
Scott: You want a magnet find in?

353
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,003
Scott: You know where.

354
00:25:18,023 --> 00:25:21,273
Rym: I know where go on his canal, you know, we're gonna find.

355
00:25:21,293 --> 00:25:23,380
Rym: we're gonna find a barrel full of poison.

356
00:25:24,664 --> 00:25:25,717
Scott: At least you won't smoke it.

357
00:25:27,841 --> 00:25:32,938
Rym: The only problem with this is that one that the magnet he bought was like 500 bucks.

358
00:25:33,581 --> 00:25:35,665
Scott: Yeah You're gonna spend the five and two.

359
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:40,361
Rym: I remember the last time we had an idea like this and we went dumpster dive in a Bunch.

360
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:44,820
Rym: we got fishing is a better than dumpster diving and we were like, oh, we'll sell it all.

361
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,849
Rym: We didn't sell any other gonna sell them stuff.

362
00:25:46,869 --> 00:25:47,873
Scott: We find magnet fishing.

363
00:25:47,954 --> 00:25:49,420
Scott: We're just gonna dump right back in the water.

364
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:52,714
Rym: We're pretty sure it's actually illegal to dump it back in the water cuz that's dumping.

365
00:25:52,755 --> 00:25:53,920
Scott: We'll leave it right on the beach.

366
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,545
Rym: So my thing of the day.

367
00:25:59,066 --> 00:26:00,973
Rym: Phil showed this to me over the weekend.

368
00:26:00,993 --> 00:26:02,960
Rym: apparently it was it went viral a couple years ago.

369
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:03,843
Rym: I just never noticed.

370
00:26:04,645 --> 00:26:10,902
Rym: Uh, it is called my cousin Oscar and Oscar lives in Iceland Iceland.

371
00:26:10,922 --> 00:26:11,465
Rym: it's cold.

372
00:26:11,626 --> 00:26:13,755
Rym: They don't get a lot of sunlight in the wind.

373
00:26:13,795 --> 00:26:18,040
Scott: people always talk about like Oh, the Vikings are trying to be silly like internet people.

374
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:22,940
Scott: All right, they they called the Greenland Iceland in the Iceland Greenland, but no Iceland is also in Iceland.

375
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,904
Scott: They're both Iceland's.

376
00:26:23,924 --> 00:26:26,213
Scott: they just called one of them Greenland to be funny.

377
00:26:26,253 --> 00:26:34,275
Rym: The other one was true, but Oscar found out about the concept of daylight saving time in America.

378
00:26:34,416 --> 00:26:35,800
Scott: He didn't know about it in Australia.

379
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,768
Scott: They don't have that in Iceland.

380
00:26:36,909 --> 00:26:39,845
Scott: Most places don't have it So he didn't even know.

381
00:26:39,865 --> 00:26:44,037
Rym: it was a thing and he's pissed off about it and how we make.

382
00:26:44,117 --> 00:26:45,863
Scott: I'm also pissed off about Yeah, I'm his son.

383
00:26:45,883 --> 00:26:50,180
Rym: I feel like we should go back a couple hours like go to ADT right now.

384
00:26:50,321 --> 00:26:54,629
Scott: Yeah, right now right now The way the time is in the summer.

385
00:26:54,649 --> 00:26:55,995
Scott: I wake up.

386
00:26:56,035 --> 00:26:56,979
Scott: It's like seven ish.

387
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:01,500
Scott: The sun's already fucking up like you don't see no sunrise, which means we need to move that shit.

388
00:27:01,862 --> 00:27:05,280
Scott: It's like the sunrise should be one or two hours later in the day, right?

389
00:27:05,722 --> 00:27:09,160
Rym: Rise just as I get to work like I get as much daylight as possible.

390
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:14,732
Scott: Yeah, the Sun should rise like 637 and then right now The Sun is setting at 830 ish, right?

391
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:20,334
Scott: It's like why can't the Sun set it like eight nine thirty ten something like that.

392
00:27:20,595 --> 00:27:28,742
Scott: if we move the Sun set up We could have the Sun set We move the Sun rise up the Sun set could be like 10 11 and then as soon as it gets dark I go to bed.

393
00:27:28,963 --> 00:27:43,980
Rym: something was always nice as a kid is that I can hang out in the park all that time both Detroit Biking into like 10. no problem Detroit and Cedar Point are in the same time zone as New York But they're way to the west so we end up getting more daylight in the evening as a result.

394
00:27:44,221 --> 00:27:46,990
Scott: I'm just saying that's what we should be doing right.

395
00:27:47,050 --> 00:28:05,876
Scott: and then if you want to move the clock around move it to keep the sunrise close to wake-up time as possible, but Oscar is Dumpstruck that we have this giant like Biannual argument about daylight saving time over one fucking hour.

396
00:28:05,896 --> 00:28:07,000
Rym: He's like one hour.

397
00:28:07,481 --> 00:28:09,709
Rym: I would do anything to have another hour of daylight.

398
00:28:09,969 --> 00:28:11,856
Rym: I get three hours of daylight.

399
00:28:12,136 --> 00:28:13,200
Rym: Did you want to see my dog?

400
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,346
Rym: Oh, you can't because it's fucking dark.

401
00:28:15,426 --> 00:28:16,791
Rym: It's 3 p.m.. Right now.

402
00:28:16,851 --> 00:28:17,815
Rym: Let's go to the beach.

403
00:28:18,337 --> 00:28:19,240
Rym: Oh, I would die.

404
00:28:20,502 --> 00:28:23,800
Rym: The video is just pretty funny, and I urge you to send this to people.

405
00:28:24,041 --> 00:28:25,006
Scott: I think it's a little fake.

406
00:28:25,046 --> 00:28:29,025
Rym: the video he does it is it's very performative But it's the same time.

407
00:28:29,065 --> 00:28:31,756
Scott: he definitely used some after-effects to make it darker inside.

408
00:28:31,897 --> 00:28:32,580
Rym: I don't think he did.

409
00:28:33,243 --> 00:28:34,420
Scott: It's not really that dark.

410
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:39,259
Scott: I think he just has a crappy camera as he pointed out definitely definitely did tricks to make it look darker than it is.

411
00:28:39,822 --> 00:28:41,751
Rym: I mean if it's I mean when.

412
00:28:41,771 --> 00:28:43,600
Scott: I mean I can make that video in New York.

413
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:46,039
Scott: It just filmed the whole thing at midnight and change the time my watch.

414
00:28:46,603 --> 00:28:50,445
Rym: I don't think he did because I looked up and yeah The sun's only.

415
00:28:50,465 --> 00:28:53,800
Rym: just it's up for like four and a half hours in the middle of winter.

416
00:28:53,921 --> 00:28:57,620
Rym: But like the two ends of that four and a half hours are dawn and dusk.

417
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,069
Rym: There's only like three hours of actual sunlight.

418
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:01,856
Scott: It still seems a little bit exaggerated.

419
00:29:01,936 --> 00:29:02,076
Rym: No.

420
00:29:02,116 --> 00:29:03,000
Rym: I mean it just gets dark.

421
00:29:03,922 --> 00:29:05,315
Rym: It's dark, and that's it mm-hmm.

422
00:29:06,343 --> 00:29:09,480
Rym: So uh in the meta moment the book club book is Dune Frank Erbert's.

423
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,858
Rym: I'm gonna update the website, and we're gonna actually start reading it soon.

424
00:29:11,878 --> 00:29:17,294
Rym: uh You should follow Scott's YouTube channel and my youtube channel.

425
00:29:17,454 --> 00:29:18,819
Rym: both of them have good stuff on them.

426
00:29:19,742 --> 00:29:24,399
Rym: The antenna show is gonna come back as soon as Connecticut's done because I got to make sure that stuff's all out of the way.

427
00:29:24,843 --> 00:29:35,450
Rym: but I got the production pipeline set up and after Considerable effort I have fought uh and won Every goddamn copyright claim on the YouTube show.

428
00:29:35,651 --> 00:29:42,109

00:29:43,251 --> 00:29:46,620
Rym: I filed like 50 fucking counter notifications.

431
00:29:47,367 --> 00:29:48,600
Rym: I like made a template.

432
00:29:48,821 --> 00:29:51,595
Rym: Holy crap, but I fought for you guys.

433
00:29:51,876 --> 00:29:57,900
Rym: your tennis show is up I think it's gonna stay up, and I have a way to probably avoid this for the future episodes.

434
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:02,194
Rym: So shortly after Connecticut, and we're starting that production pipeline up again in earnest.

435
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:09,567
Rym: so stay tuned because actually There's more who ten a manga coming so Okay, and also there's a Twitter account.

436
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:12,859
Rym: I follow this new ten about the tweets like who tennis screenshots every day.

437
00:30:13,644 --> 00:30:15,817
Rym: I'm feeling who ten again in a big way.

438
00:30:15,938 --> 00:30:26,059
Rym: so Feeling doing that show and there's sunlight so we can do video shows and in the evening and still have natural light coming in the Window which makes it way easier to do video.

439
00:30:27,044 --> 00:30:27,792
Rym: So stay tuned.

440
00:30:27,853 --> 00:30:31,268
Rym: it's coming And I guess just right out of the main bit.

441
00:30:31,368 --> 00:30:33,316
Rym: so a lot of you might have seen this story.

442
00:30:33,396 --> 00:30:34,340
Scott: this story got po.

443
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,047
Scott: I saw where it was originally posted.

444
00:30:36,088 --> 00:30:37,393
Scott: I think I'd like programming read it.

445
00:30:37,454 --> 00:30:40,346
Scott: Maybe or something like that Wherever is originally posted.

446
00:30:40,446 --> 00:30:47,550
Scott: I saw it and basically the story is this is some kid who was getting like an internship Or like his first job out of college a brand new developer.

447
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:51,845
Scott: right he goes and gets a programming job wherever he can and he's Doing the the.

448
00:30:52,066 --> 00:30:59,758
Scott: you know employee set up your computer Which is when you're a developer is a little different because you have to you're not only Development environment build and fire.

449
00:30:59,778 --> 00:31:09,056
Scott: yeah You have to install it you have to set up a bunch of stuff and in doing so the reason we don't just automate it And just give it to you already set up is because you learn how the shit works by setting it up.

450
00:31:09,116 --> 00:31:17,750
Scott: right yep, so He did it and in doing so accidentally Erased the company's production database or whatever and like they.

451
00:31:17,951 --> 00:31:20,157
Scott: so they fired him because he messed up so bad quote.

452
00:31:20,197 --> 00:31:22,720
Rym: the CEO told me To leave and never come back.

453
00:31:23,001 --> 00:31:26,700
Rym: He also informed me that apparently legal would need to be involved to the severity of the data loss.

454
00:31:27,062 --> 00:31:29,860
Rym: I basically offered and pleaded to let me help in some way to redeem myself.

455
00:31:30,081 --> 00:31:30,483
Rym: I don't know.

456
00:31:30,503 --> 00:31:34,220
Rym: I was told quote I completely fucked everything up, so I just saw this story posted everywhere.

457
00:31:34,362 --> 00:31:40,360
Scott: I don't actually know if it's true This could be a fake story, but I can say this, but it doesn't seem like it's advertising anything.

458
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:50,245
Scott: So if it was a fake story that someone just wanted to spread around the internet to hoax people They there was no one who could gain anything from this story Other than starting this discussion.

459
00:31:50,406 --> 00:31:58,829
Rym: I have seen this exact same story like the same type of story occur Many times in my professional life.

460
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:02,280
Rym: I have heard anecdotes from people who did this thing.

461
00:32:02,902 --> 00:32:12,483
Rym: I have like this story that the beats of it even if this individual story We're not true has happened time and time again, and I want to say Categorically 100%.

462
00:32:12,483 --> 00:32:17,255
Rym: it is never the person who fucked up productions fault.

463
00:32:17,636 --> 00:32:27,000
Rym: it is the fault of the CTO For not having controls in place to prevent that from occurring not having backups not having like a redundancy plan.

464
00:32:27,541 --> 00:32:29,928
Rym: It is never the developers fault in this case right.

465
00:32:29,968 --> 00:32:33,076
Scott: so here's here's the details of this specific instance right.

466
00:32:33,417 --> 00:32:37,180
Scott: so the first problem Was why is it even possible?

467
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:43,338
Scott: For a developer on their computer sitting on their desk to connect to the production database?

468
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,883
Scott: at my work We have a production database.

469
00:32:44,983 --> 00:32:48,915
Scott: obviously yep say this production database is on Amazon's cloud or whatever.

470
00:32:49,356 --> 00:32:50,680
Scott: right you cannot.

471
00:32:50,801 --> 00:32:57,240
Scott: There is no network access to it from anywhere except a few Whitelisted web servers that are supposed to connect to it.

472
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:00,872
Scott: Yeah, every company I've ever been not connect to it except from those machines.

473
00:33:00,952 --> 00:33:03,842
Rym: the developers are on their own subnet.

474
00:33:04,163 --> 00:33:08,738
Rym: you can only access the source repositories and their own servers.

475
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:13,394
Rym: and like Staging areas and the internet of course the internet right, but it's like you could not.

476
00:33:13,435 --> 00:33:22,220
Scott: no matter how hard you tried No router that existed on the internet anywhere would route a packet from your computer to that database server.

477
00:33:22,524 --> 00:33:23,779
Scott: You cannot communicate with it.

478
00:33:24,071 --> 00:33:26,005
Scott: it's Absolutely impossible to do so.

479
00:33:26,025 --> 00:33:37,960
Scott: and and it's you would need like SSH keys and someone would have to make those for you by hand And specifically grant you access and tell you how to somehow connect through various machines to get there.

480
00:33:38,201 --> 00:33:41,640
Scott: There is no way you could accidentally do anything to it whatsoever.

481
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:51,319
Rym: It's called the concept like the fundamental concept cuz I I do a lot of qualitative risk analysis in my actual job And I've done this in my other jobs before too.

482
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:59,712
Rym: So like I analyze these kinds of risks and there's a thing called like a sock one audit and there's other thing like there's other Types of audits you can do but are like Sarbanes.

483
00:33:59,813 --> 00:34:00,879
Rym: Oxley has rules about this.

484
00:34:01,342 --> 00:34:04,680
Rym: But the gist is the idea of separation of duties meaning you have developers.

485
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:07,473
Rym: developers cannot ever touch production.

486
00:34:07,956 --> 00:34:08,379
Rym: you have QA.

487
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,712
Rym: Developers cannot touch QA systems.

488
00:34:12,275 --> 00:34:15,647
Rym: You have operations Operations troubleshoots production systems.

489
00:34:15,888 --> 00:34:19,540
Rym: They can never see the source code of the development systems.

490
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,719
Rym: They could never touch developer systems or the source code repository.

491
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:30,804
Rym: Right, you separate the roles and you don't just separate them with rules you separate them with hard IT Controls, right?

492
00:34:30,864 --> 00:34:51,538
Scott: So with a combination of network security, right of you know firewalls and these sorts of things and also, you know authentic authorization authentication mechanisms like SSH and such and such it becomes physically and Mathematically impossible for people to connect to a place that they are not supposed to connect to.

493
00:34:51,719 --> 00:35:06,460
Rym: Yep so if of someone like any employee of any company connects to something they shouldn't have and fucks it up either they Maliciously and with ill intent broke in which again that means your security sucks ass.

494
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,783
Rym: Yeah, it's really.

495
00:35:08,024 --> 00:35:11,914
Scott: it's really hard to break through as is to your company's controls.

496
00:35:12,295 --> 00:35:14,120
Rym: suck ass and it's your company's fault.

497
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:23,333
Scott: I think the only way it could happen at our company would be like if somebody was like SSH didn't do a machine and which they would only do in like a crazy situation.

498
00:35:23,353 --> 00:35:31,607
Scott: to begin with right and Some and they didn't lock their computer and they got up and walked away and someone else came over and was like Again, that's malicious intent.

499
00:35:31,688 --> 00:35:32,471
Rym: I'm saying right?

500
00:35:32,491 --> 00:35:34,520
Scott: It's like that's the kind of thing that would have to happen.

501
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,028
Rym: But even then that's a violation of procedures like so.

502
00:35:37,329 --> 00:35:40,920
Rym: most companies like you have DevOps, right or operations teams.

503
00:35:41,221 --> 00:35:45,260
Rym: They used to be called so like in any company I've ever worked for and like most places.

504
00:35:45,681 --> 00:35:47,667
Rym: Say you have your production system like you're on Twitter, right?

505
00:35:47,948 --> 00:35:49,493
Rym: There's servers that are running.

506
00:35:49,573 --> 00:35:51,560
Rym: the real Twitter live right now.

507
00:35:52,823 --> 00:36:04,970
Rym: the only people who can ever Like SSH into those servers are the people on the operations team whose sole job it is to troubleshoot Problems with those systems and to deploy new builds to them.

508
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:13,340
Scott: also something that's so big like Twitter is built in such a way with Redundancy that they would just like if they needed to actually do something to specific servers like that.

509
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,050
Scott: They would just remove them from the Twitter.

510
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:19,739
Scott: Twitter would continue working Yeah, and they would mess with them and then add them back to the real Twitter.

511
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:24,420
Scott: So let's almost everything they do would not be done by hand direct to machines.

512
00:36:24,761 --> 00:36:27,829
Scott: It would be through automation things that were separate.

513
00:36:27,849 --> 00:36:29,675
Scott: They would talk to these automation servers.

514
00:36:30,015 --> 00:36:34,139
Scott: that would then you know Orient the real servers, right?

515
00:36:34,983 --> 00:36:45,000
Scott: And that layer in between is like you can go push your button that says like increased capacity or You know to deploy this new build or something like that and you just pushes one button.

516
00:36:45,361 --> 00:36:47,388
Scott: You couldn't go do anything by hand and fuck it up.

517
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:50,640
Scott: It's that tested code that does that deployment that does everything.

518
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:52,977
Rym: Yeah, well, here's an example from two different companies.

519
00:36:53,038 --> 00:36:55,848
Rym: I were Almost to two and a half.

520
00:36:55,908 --> 00:36:56,994
Scott: I've never worked at a place.

521
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:57,717
Scott: That was stupid.

522
00:36:57,938 --> 00:36:59,825
Rym: Yeah now I've never worked partly cuz I mind.

523
00:36:59,845 --> 00:37:00,668
Scott: where have I ever worked?

524
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:04,020
Rym: hospitals dangerous factories and Wall Street.

525
00:37:04,201 --> 00:37:07,620
Rym: Yeah, like two of my jobs were death on the line.

526
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:11,280
Scott: If we fuck I've never worked at a place as stupid as the place or this person supposedly work.

527
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:20,473
Rym: Nope, but even if it's a single server like I've administered systems usually in an operational capacity We're like there is a single production server doing something really important.

528
00:37:20,955 --> 00:37:21,698
Rym: So you first.

529
00:37:21,738 --> 00:37:24,247
Rym: we have Developers on their own subnet.

530
00:37:24,468 --> 00:37:27,780
Rym: They'll never even know like they'll never see a production server.

531
00:37:28,062 --> 00:37:30,900
Rym: They write code they test code that right unit test.

532
00:37:31,121 --> 00:37:44,548
Rym: They live in their own world when they have code that's ready to go to production they check it in and Then the QA team has a separate procedure like on the other side of a firewall where they check out Compiled like code ready to run.

533
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:47,056
Rym: they then test it in an environment.

534
00:37:47,076 --> 00:37:48,120
Rym: They'll never see production.

535
00:37:48,462 --> 00:37:49,528
Rym: They'll never see dev.

536
00:37:49,890 --> 00:38:13,278
Rym: when they test it and they think it's good They stage it to the operations team the operations team stages it into a pre-production environment and they do like their sanity checks and like Practice the deployment and then usually there's an automated process saying Okay The thing we put in pre-production the CTO signed off hit this button and the next morning It'll be running in prod by an automated process.

537
00:38:14,841 --> 00:38:16,787
Rym: That way at no point.

538
00:38:17,148 --> 00:38:21,119
Rym: Is there any way for anyone to fuck up the thing that they are not responsible for?

539
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,559
Rym: Like ops can fuck up the production system because their job is to not fuck it up.

540
00:38:26,041 --> 00:38:31,880
Rym: Dev can fuck up like the current active build in the dev environment, but of course you can just roll back.

541
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,765
Rym: You know the right.

542
00:38:32,905 --> 00:38:33,488
Scott: that's the other.

543
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:35,740
Scott: the two other fuck-ups of this specific instance.

544
00:38:35,841 --> 00:38:39,399
Scott: Right, the other fuck-up is they didn't back this shit up.

545
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:46,680
Scott: Well, they'd not only than I'm at my company if you if you came into my company And I just let you connect to the MySQL prompt on the production.

546
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,113
Scott: Yeah, just like drop tables just like, you know, delete all databases.

547
00:38:50,153 --> 00:38:51,639
Rym: Maha ha ha ha ha stop star from.

548
00:38:51,659 --> 00:38:56,895
Scott: you know I can go to Oz and click like one button and roll the database back five minutes.

549
00:38:57,016 --> 00:38:58,219
Scott: and it rolls back five minutes.

550
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:01,852
Scott: and Even if you fuck that up, I have a nightly backup.

551
00:39:01,993 --> 00:39:03,960
Scott: I can restore it in like a minute.

552
00:39:04,061 --> 00:39:06,033
Scott: I just type like two commands and it restores it.

553
00:39:06,053 --> 00:39:13,780
Scott: Yeah, it's really fast It's not that big and it like more controlled environments like, you know The production ops thing and if you deleted all the backups, well, they're in more than one place.

554
00:39:14,001 --> 00:39:15,569
Scott: It's like it would be so difficult.

555
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:17,760
Scott: Yeah for you to actually cause any damage.

556
00:39:18,021 --> 00:39:27,156
Rym: So if I as an operation person like we deploy the build and we fuck it up There was always a very explicit procedure that had to be verified before you can even roll something out into production.

557
00:39:27,217 --> 00:39:32,736
Rym: that says if it Fucks up here is how to roll it back and we've and you test that procedure.

558
00:39:32,796 --> 00:39:33,920
Scott: Our rollback is so easy.

559
00:39:34,102 --> 00:39:35,236
Scott: We've done it so many time.

560
00:39:35,841 --> 00:39:36,985
Rym: Our rollback.

561
00:39:37,005 --> 00:39:41,060
Scott: we actually used to do it more but we haven't done in so long, but it worked every time.

562
00:39:41,221 --> 00:39:43,340
Scott: Yeah, cuz that's the other thing never had it not work.

563
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:50,079
Rym: You need procedures to separate all these things and to like like, you know Each like you whoever's responsible stuff like what they're supposed to do.

564
00:39:50,541 --> 00:39:56,397
Rym: You have procedures for rolling back and you have procedures to confirm that all that stuff actually works.

565
00:39:56,417 --> 00:40:08,654
Rym: a lot of companies Yeah that last part take quote unquote backups and then one day like the production system fails and they take the backup and they like Run the script to load into production and it just doesn't work.

566
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:09,959
Rym: They've never tested it.

567
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:13,594
Scott: The backup that you haven't tried to actually restore with.

568
00:40:13,795 --> 00:40:22,460
Rym: I saw in fact I saw a system once where someone had a really important wiki that was like all the internal business documentation like, you know serious stuff.

569
00:40:23,022 --> 00:40:25,812
Rym: so they had a primary server and then a backup server.

570
00:40:26,415 --> 00:40:36,612
Rym: one day they fucked up and Deleted everything on the primary server and that sent those deletes over to the back I don't see was just the MySQL database running.

571
00:40:36,653 --> 00:40:38,400
Rym: everything was a master slave.

572
00:40:38,641 --> 00:40:43,159
Rym: So the backup system was literally deleted in the same millisecond that the production system was.

573
00:40:44,381 --> 00:40:45,486
Scott: That's my SQL host.

574
00:40:45,566 --> 00:40:46,410
Scott: master sleeve works.

575
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:48,500
Scott: just sounds the MySQL commands to the other server.

576
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:54,860
Rym: Yeah, that's that's the we've done shows on that before the difference between high availability and disaster recovery.

577
00:40:55,101 --> 00:40:55,846
Rym: So the different things.

578
00:40:55,866 --> 00:40:59,659
Scott: so the third mistake here and this is the craziest mistake I don't even think you need to explain this.

579
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:11,786
Scott: Yeah, like in the instructions this new developer was following in order to set up their environment Was like, you know, you know, it was like go create, you know, you set up your own local database, you know Create username and password, whatever.

580
00:41:12,147 --> 00:41:17,749
Scott: but that document had the production host username and password in it And you were supposed to like replace them.

581
00:41:18,131 --> 00:41:23,131
Scott: that depending with your own But they just copied and pasted depending on the industry you're in.

582
00:41:23,151 --> 00:41:24,414
Rym: that violates laws.

583
00:41:24,776 --> 00:41:30,860
Rym: Yeah, but Don't put that no human being all like this.

584
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:38,859
Rym: So in the in like the place like the broker dealer I worked at right there was a there's technically a root password to the production Sit like the Linux servers, right?

585
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:42,920
Rym: It was unique for every server that existed in one play.

586
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:51,099
Rym: Well two places in the well three places in the world It was there was in an envelope in a safe deposit box that like the chairman of the board had a key to.

587
00:41:51,963 --> 00:42:05,416
Rym: It was in like a little safe in the president's office that could be opened in an emergency And it was in an encrypted like file that required multiple encryption keys from like the CTO and the head of operations to open.

588
00:42:05,577 --> 00:42:07,643
Scott: see what I do on Production servers.

589
00:42:07,663 --> 00:42:13,520
Scott: these days are all servers actually is the at the root password is unknown to every human being on earth.

590
00:42:13,741 --> 00:42:15,609
Scott: It's just generated completely randomly.

591
00:42:15,709 --> 00:42:16,452
Scott: It's really big.

592
00:42:16,512 --> 00:42:23,440
Scott: So you pseudo sue right and then If you want to connect to this machine, you have to SSH into it with it with a key.

593
00:42:23,681 --> 00:42:26,229
Scott: There's no other way to connect to it with it with the SSH.

594
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:27,514
Rym: every server I administer.

595
00:42:27,534 --> 00:42:29,380
Rym: There are no passwords for anyone.

596
00:42:29,502 --> 00:42:30,700
Scott: Yeah, there's no passwords at all.

597
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:37,695
Scott: Everything is keys, you know really big SSH keys and you can add and remove them from the authorized Post the keys file, whatever.

598
00:42:37,716 --> 00:42:41,852
Rym: Yeah But what's really crazy is that this company is like.

599
00:42:42,073 --> 00:42:43,780
Rym: it's such a fuck-up on so many levels.

600
00:42:44,222 --> 00:42:49,242
Rym: but the fact that they're like threatening to sue this kid is Ridiculous.

601
00:42:49,604 --> 00:42:55,587
Scott: Yeah, a lot of people in the comments because this is posted on like every tech site ever We're like, you know, I'm a lawyer.

602
00:42:55,628 --> 00:42:56,771
Scott: I'll cover you right.

603
00:42:56,811 --> 00:43:03,900
Rym: call me if they actually sue you if anything actually Depending on the state or the country you're in and I'm not a lawyer.

604
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:04,884
Rym: It's not legal advice.

605
00:43:05,406 --> 00:43:13,238
Rym: being fired for that is arguably a wrongful termination Possibly because you were following instructions that were probably poorly written, right?

606
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,640
Rym: They were probably written by the CTO once and they never really looked at him again.

607
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:21,120
Scott: So this is something else that bothers me and it's actually a problem at my work, right?

608
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,789
Scott: And it's you know related to this right.

609
00:43:23,829 --> 00:43:26,098
Scott: is this kid or I assume a kid, right?

610
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:29,715
Rym: Well Anyone who's junior in any position ever?

611
00:43:29,775 --> 00:43:34,633
Scott: I just call kid Was Copying and pasting the commands from this document.

612
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:35,195
Scott: Yep, right.

613
00:43:35,215 --> 00:43:47,424
Scott: I And at work people are always pressuring me to like write Instructions that they can use and then copy paste and there are people who are doing things and they're just following procedures without understanding what they're doing.

614
00:43:47,866 --> 00:44:03,185
Scott: and I'm like if you don't understand what you're doing to the point at which you would not need a Document to tell you and then you shouldn't be doing those things Right, it's like the reason that you're if like if you're gonna give a person as a list of commands to copy and paste to Set up a dev environment.

615
00:44:03,587 --> 00:44:04,592
Scott: You just set it up for them.

616
00:44:04,612 --> 00:44:05,577
Scott: They're not learning anything.

617
00:44:05,597 --> 00:44:07,408
Scott: Yeah, right It's like you.

618
00:44:07,488 --> 00:44:09,240
Scott: if you're a professional develop, it's you know.

619
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:13,558
Scott: It's understandable if you're a driver of a car not to know how a car works.

620
00:44:13,618 --> 00:44:25,320
Scott: completely Right, you know the basics, but if your job is professional developer You shouldn't understand what the hell is going on to the point at which you don't need to be copying and pasting these instructions.

621
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:26,107
Scott: Things are new to you.

622
00:44:27,842 --> 00:44:31,440
Scott: You should be learning them as you go to the point at which you need to copy paste them.

623
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:37,579
Rym: Here is an example understand like a real tech example of the driver of the car versus the I guess developer of the car.

624
00:44:38,383 --> 00:44:53,591
Rym: so the developer will make it like say you have a really critical like system that runs on a single server like some internal enterprise thing like a trading system or something real important that isn't like a distributed cloud thing and The developers know how to deploy it.

625
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:55,400
Rym: or like do a change to or whatever.

626
00:44:55,961 --> 00:45:17,675
Rym: But the person on the far other end of the chain and the operations team who is going to deploy it the final time for real To like the staging area for production that person might get a set of instruction that includes copy paste this command then this command because their only Mandate is to do exactly what the QA team and the dev team signed off on.

627
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,397
Rym: Mm-hmm.

628
00:45:18,417 --> 00:45:21,086
Rym: They don't need to know Necessarily what it does.

629
00:45:21,146 --> 00:45:24,580
Rym: In fact, it's better if they could do it not knowing anything.

630
00:45:24,701 --> 00:45:29,120
Rym: That way it's basically idiot proof because the work was already all done by the developers in the queue.

631
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:32,693
Scott: But if that person is mindlessly entering commands, then you don't just.

632
00:45:32,734 --> 00:45:34,420
Scott: you could just had the QA team push a button.

633
00:45:34,522 --> 00:45:34,873
Scott: You don't know.

634
00:45:35,802 --> 00:45:40,780
Rym: Well, the reason there is simply that that the the script might be push a button.

635
00:45:40,841 --> 00:45:45,493
Rym: The idea is you make it push a button in the end But the QA team shouldn't be the ones to push the button.

636
00:45:45,775 --> 00:45:49,915
Scott: the QA teams push the button But if the person doesn't understand what they're doing they're useless.

637
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:52,547
Scott: as soon as something goes wrong They're gonna be like a QA team.

638
00:45:52,567 --> 00:45:52,848
Scott: help me.

639
00:45:52,888 --> 00:45:58,615
Scott: and now the QA team is making decisions and you're just having this person Basically in between the brain that knows something.

640
00:45:58,715 --> 00:45:59,720
Scott: Here's the keyboard.

641
00:46:01,607 --> 00:46:04,369
Scott: If I know everything You're a know-nothing.

642
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:05,559
Scott: All you know how to do is type.

643
00:46:06,022 --> 00:46:09,400
Scott: Why should we use your fingers to do the typing when all the good stuff is in my brain?

644
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:11,045
Rym: I can tell you exactly why.

645
00:46:11,126 --> 00:46:11,688
Scott: as pointless.

646
00:46:11,708 --> 00:46:12,712
Rym: I can tell you exactly why.

647
00:46:12,752 --> 00:46:14,580
Rym: a big part of this is things like Sarbanes-Oxley.

648
00:46:15,023 --> 00:46:17,939
Rym: The people who are administering the system.

649
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:33,960
Rym: See like they'd like the DevOps people they have access to like legally Data information or whatever that might have regulatory or legal consequences to them knowing or having access to right.

650
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:44,060
Scott: So if they do not have the knowledge to where they need to use my brain and they're just basically you all they have is Keyboard fingers as in replacing my keyboard fingers then fire those fuckers.

651
00:46:44,362 --> 00:46:45,693
Scott: Someone who fucking knows something.

652
00:46:45,734 --> 00:46:46,480
Scott: don't do that job.

653
00:46:48,564 --> 00:46:51,723
Scott: You have to call me then you don't deserve your job Legally.

654
00:46:51,763 --> 00:46:53,230
Scott: the reason is the call me to have.

655
00:46:53,251 --> 00:47:10,180
Scott: the reason is those people legally Cannot have access to QA systems under it doesn't have access to the systems, but they need to be have Technological knowledge to where they're more than just someone who types what someone else told them to think for themselves.

656
00:47:11,042 --> 00:47:16,320
Rym: If you are not enough people on earth to hire for those roles Right, so if I'm just saying it you wait.

657
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:25,674
Scott: If you don't hire one of those not enough people on earth you end up like this shitty fucking company here that loses their production Day because you didn't spend enough to hire people who knew something.

658
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:26,900
Rym: at every place is there were confident.

659
00:47:27,342 --> 00:47:33,356
Rym: It doesn't matter if the dev team knows what they're doing for like a rollout or something Because it's already all been tested and it's bulletproof.

660
00:47:33,376 --> 00:47:36,840
Rym: and if they fuck it up They have backup procedures and fail at all the stuff in place.

661
00:47:37,141 --> 00:47:45,550
Rym: The problem was that this company assumed a whole bunch of shit had no controls Had no backups had no and basically the company had nothing.

662
00:47:46,392 --> 00:47:49,260
Rym: and there are a lot of companies that basically have nothing.

663
00:47:50,203 --> 00:47:54,599
Scott: If you want to hire ops people, they should be people that can solve the problem on their own and don't you know?

664
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:58,100
Scott: Oh, no, I just type in my my copy and pasters.

665
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:04,620
Rym: My preference is to only hire developers or IT people for QA and operations roles.

666
00:48:05,184 --> 00:48:07,119
Rym: That that is my preference and that's what I'm saying.

667
00:48:07,622 --> 00:48:14,480
Scott: Nobody nobody should be able to have a tech job that pays a lot and Responsibilities when all they know how to do is copy and paste.

668
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,505
Rym: But just make sure there is.

669
00:48:15,545 --> 00:48:22,577
Rym: there are examples where the people in QA and production ops Legally can never see the source code.

670
00:48:22,637 --> 00:48:27,500
Scott: That's fine But those people should not be so dumb that all they can do is copy and paste.

671
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:35,220
Scott: They should have the brains of their own and shouldn't have to call the developer Right to tell them what to type in because they don't understand anything about computers?

672
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:37,328
Rym: Well, usually what end isn't happening in those situations?

673
00:48:37,348 --> 00:48:40,600
Rym: like say there's a problem in production and then the developer needs to troubleshoot it.

674
00:48:40,943 --> 00:48:42,280
Rym: Then you do a thing.

675
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:49,420
Rym: We're like the ops person logs into a system and they're the one typing because the dev person might know all about the code.

676
00:48:49,821 --> 00:48:54,940
Rym: But I might not know anything about the exact details of like the configuration of this Linux server, right?

677
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:58,840
Rym: But we're the ops person types, but the dev person says but I need to see this.

678
00:49:01,201 --> 00:49:02,005
Scott: That's different right.

679
00:49:02,025 --> 00:49:10,660
Scott: I'm talking about a situation where the developer is it knows everything And the ops person knows nothing and they're literally typing in the exact commands.

680
00:49:10,847 --> 00:49:14,852
Scott: Yeah The developer is typing because they are a know-nothing who simply copies and paste.

681
00:49:14,912 --> 00:49:18,666
Scott: literally you're talking about a situation where it's like Oh check the logs.

682
00:49:18,967 --> 00:49:21,076
Scott: Tell me if you see any errors from the whatever right?

683
00:49:21,096 --> 00:49:23,465
Scott: It's like, oh, well The person knows something.

684
00:49:23,526 --> 00:49:25,935
Scott: right is like you can just communicate with them on a higher level.

685
00:49:26,176 --> 00:49:27,340
Scott: They're doing useful things.

686
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,691
Rym: So here I'll give you a good example.

687
00:49:28,711 --> 00:49:29,880
Scott: That's a person who's useful.

688
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:34,100
Rym: I'll give you a real example when I was at that broker when we did certain kinds.

689
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:45,360
Rym: But if I'm saying like type LS go to no But like so I they hope like everyone on our ops team was like super pro IT Like we knew our shit about Linux and we knew our shit about the systems.

690
00:49:45,781 --> 00:49:54,451
Rym: But at the same time the instructions for a rollout would have copy/paste of like the specific things to do Because that was what the QA team signed off right?

691
00:49:54,471 --> 00:49:56,479
Scott: But if you looked at those things, did you understand?

692
00:49:56,519 --> 00:49:57,520
Rym: Yes I knew what they did.

693
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:02,777
Scott: Yeah, you weren't blindly copying pasting a mystery command and then when we're looking at the output going.

694
00:50:02,918 --> 00:50:03,560
Scott: Oh what happened?

695
00:50:03,882 --> 00:50:04,223
Scott: I don't know.

696
00:50:04,465 --> 00:50:05,349
Scott: What does that command do?

697
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:05,691
Scott: I don't know.

698
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:07,380
Scott: Can you read that command and explain it to me?

699
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:10,548
Scott: No, I just copied and pasted it because my job is copy/paste man.

700
00:50:10,949 --> 00:50:13,175
Rym: Type who what type who?

701
00:50:13,215 --> 00:50:13,897
Rym: who should I type?

702
00:50:13,977 --> 00:50:14,218
Rym: What?

703
00:50:14,699 --> 00:50:18,072
Rym: Yeah Type man who?

704
00:50:18,355 --> 00:50:18,879
Rym: there's no man.

705
00:50:19,302 --> 00:50:24,613
Scott: It's like there's a. you obviously want to create these layers But you don't want to have one of the layers.

706
00:50:24,673 --> 00:50:25,820
Scott: just be copy/paste man.

707
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:28,920
Scott: If you just have a copy/paste man, just give someone two fucking jobs.

708
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,210
Scott: If the law doesn't you know, y'all prevent you from doing.

709
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:33,239
Rym: the problem is in finance and a lot of places.

710
00:50:33,279 --> 00:50:35,526
Rym: the law Literally set up that way.

711
00:50:35,606 --> 00:50:37,916
Scott: We've got to hire at least one person in each layer.

712
00:50:37,936 --> 00:50:38,900
Scott: Who's not a copy/paste?

713
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:42,579
Rym: Yeah, pretty much the minimum you need is dev QA.

714
00:50:42,881 --> 00:50:47,340
Rym: Production have to be three completely separate groups that do not have access to each other's systems.

715
00:50:48,004 --> 00:50:53,594
Scott: If you can if you're doing a less serious line of business You just need to separate the dev QA and the production.

716
00:50:53,614 --> 00:50:54,920
Scott: You only need the two layers, right?

717
00:50:55,461 --> 00:50:58,900
Scott: You know, it's not really a big deal if QA and Dev are messing around with each other.

718
00:50:59,503 --> 00:51:02,497
Scott: If you're making like a video game or something, it's like it's no big deal.

719
00:51:02,858 --> 00:51:03,100
Rym: Yeah

720
00:51:03,701 --> 00:51:07,162
Scott: But if you're making, you know a financial thing or a medical thing I think

721
00:51:07,383 --> 00:51:13,208
Rym: video game unless you're at unless you're a one or two person studio You probably still want all three layers only because I totally want

722
00:51:13,248 --> 00:51:17,500
Scott: to have the layers, but you don't need to strictly separate the non-production.

723
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:20,290
Scott: Oh, yeah, let's separate the production for the non-production.

724
00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:21,093
Rym: developers.

725
00:51:21,173 --> 00:51:23,180
Rym: go log into a QA system to examine some.

726
00:51:23,309 --> 00:51:25,420
Scott: Yeah It's like who gives a shit if it's not super secure.

727
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:30,600
Rym: What you definitely don't want developers also doing QA because if you know they should be doing they should not be doing the QA.

728
00:51:31,383 --> 00:51:35,840
Scott: Like developer it's okay for the developer about the access of systems and information.

729
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:40,980
Rym: Developer can write a unit test for their code as long as QA writes their own unit test for the same code.

730
00:51:41,882 --> 00:51:44,280
Rym: If you're doing unit tests, I mean there's different kinds of development, right?

731
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:46,426
Scott: But that's you know, but the point is the.

732
00:51:46,627 --> 00:51:50,540
Scott: the only thing you need no matter what is that production not production barrier?

733
00:51:51,001 --> 00:52:01,380
Rym: And you only need that second QA dev Barrier if your business is super serious or if you just make any amount of money because as soon as you make amount of money You probably want to have that extra make a ton of money.

734
00:52:01,482 --> 00:52:02,681
Scott: It's super serious Isn't it?

735
00:52:02,781 --> 00:52:03,624
Rym: to cover your ass?

736
00:52:03,664 --> 00:52:11,967
Rym: because the really is this company fucked up and it is literally like it is the fault of the CTO 100% that this company fucked up.

737
00:52:12,148 --> 00:52:13,513
Rym: Yeah, I wish I knew what company it was.

738
00:52:13,895 --> 00:52:15,160
Rym: Yeah, that'd be really funny to find.

739
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,067
Rym: I'm sure I could find out.

740
00:52:16,188 --> 00:52:18,724
Scott: it's probably not somebody's big Could be.

741
00:52:19,005 --> 00:52:20,832
Rym: I've seen big fuck-ups at big companies before.

742
00:52:21,354 --> 00:52:22,900
Scott: I can't imagine it would be somebody's big.

743
00:52:23,161 --> 00:52:26,252
Scott: It has like just one production database only that could be deleted.

744
00:52:26,794 --> 00:52:28,300
Rym: Ah, I've seen some shit.

745
00:52:29,461 --> 00:52:31,024
Scott: How big could it be?

746
00:52:31,044 --> 00:52:38,746
Scott: I and if all the websites we go to are still working so it wasn't any of them True slash shots up Right now, right.

747
00:52:38,827 --> 00:52:41,778
Rym: It's no it's not places where there's running as far as I know right now.

748
00:52:41,979 --> 00:52:49,351
Rym: Yeah but yeah, the moral of all this separation of duties and That developer is not the problem at that company.

749
00:52:49,472 --> 00:52:52,564
Rym: If you think that that developer is at fault for this nobody.

750
00:52:52,665 --> 00:53:04,536
Scott: nobody thinks that it's just a funny story because that someone actually Supposedly this actually really happened and they posted this story Literally everywhere on the internet and because everyone was like, oh my god that company so bad.

751
00:53:04,616 --> 00:53:05,820
Scott: It's spread like wildfire.

752
00:53:06,625 --> 00:53:08,302
Rym: That company is so bad It's so.

753
00:53:08,724 --> 00:53:12,280
Rym: it's one thing if you have a company that plays fast and loose cuz we know we could think of it this way.

754
00:53:12,661 --> 00:53:25,105
Rym: The more strict you are about that stuff the more money and time it takes to do anything Mm-hmm, but if you're fast and loose with that stuff, you can get product out a lot faster and then also crash and burn From one guy.

755
00:53:25,165 --> 00:53:25,667
Scott: mess it up.

756
00:53:26,149 --> 00:53:32,695
Rym: a big part of you know, corporate qualitative risk analysis Which I alluded to at the beginning isn't necessarily controlling for all that stuff.

757
00:53:33,077 --> 00:53:45,231
Rym: It's just understanding the risks of playing fast and loose and the risks of being more, you know more formal in that stuff and Deciding what level of risk you as a company are willing to accept.

758
00:53:45,511 --> 00:53:48,560
Rym: if you're making the next Twitter cowboy it up who gives a fuck?

759
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:55,480
Rym: But at the same time this company fucked up so bad that they were cowboying but they didn't even have a backup horse.

760
00:53:56,042 --> 00:54:00,459
Rym: No, like they didn't have a horse in the stable like even like halfway ready to go.

761
00:54:01,023 --> 00:54:03,059
Rym: They didn't even have like a backup of their production database.

762
00:54:03,261 --> 00:54:06,259
Scott: They want a vacation with one pair underwear than the chef and the shat in it.

763
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:10,040
Rym: Haha, I went to anime Boston once I only I forgot to pack socks.

764
00:54:10,361 --> 00:54:13,899
Rym: So I had one pair of socks for the whole weekend and I washed them in the sink every day.

765
00:54:14,703 --> 00:54:16,793
Scott: I I got a thing of the day coming up.

766
00:54:16,974 --> 00:54:17,678
Scott: That's poop related.

767
00:54:17,698 --> 00:54:24,519
Rym: Oh I have an anecdote that is poop related from the race that I'll save for the next show.

768
00:54:27,584 --> 00:54:30,480
Rym: So the you're the porta-potty though that was right, okay I know.

769

Scott: Yeah, okay.

770
00:54:32,245 --> 00:54:37,517
Rym: I have never in my life seen a porta-potty disaster on that scale in person.

771
00:54:37,798 --> 00:54:38,058
Scott: We're good.

772
00:54:41,476 --> 00:54:44,500
Rym: Now That happens during marathons a lot which is a big part of why I don't run marathons.

773
00:54:45,422 --> 00:54:55,180
Rym: Yeah, 5k is like 20 minute like a 5k is 30 minutes Even if you're like not that fit a 5k is an hour if you don't exercise at all.
