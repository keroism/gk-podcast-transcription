00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,559
Rym: It's Wednesday, February 22nd, 2017.

2
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,144
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,224 --> 00:00:16,149
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:16,229 --> 00:00:19,849
Rym: tonight We're talking about miss Kobayashi's dragon maid.

5
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:21,828
Rym: Let's do this.

6
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:26,817
Scott: Have you heard of this new subreddit the bird?

7
00:00:26,837 --> 00:00:28,780
Scott: It's a relatively new as far as I know.

8
00:00:28,982 --> 00:00:29,931
Scott: I'm newly aware of it.

9
00:00:29,992 --> 00:00:31,282
Scott: No matter how old it is I will see.

10
00:00:31,302 --> 00:00:31,643
Rym: we'll see.

11
00:00:31,663 --> 00:00:31,804
Rym: cuz.

12
00:00:31,884 --> 00:00:36,000
Rym: I found a few choice subreddits recent and it's called shower orange.

13
00:00:37,263 --> 00:00:38,546
Rym: Yes, I saw this.

14
00:00:38,727 --> 00:00:39,910
Scott: you saw the shower orange.

15
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:45,630
Rym: first someone posted the rules to that subreddit and then later I went and actually saw the subreddit.

16
00:00:45,891 --> 00:00:47,499
Scott: So I tried to shower orange this morning.

17
00:00:49,381 --> 00:00:49,803
Rym: How'd it go?

18
00:00:50,305 --> 00:00:51,268
Scott: I went to the very.

19
00:00:51,308 --> 00:00:52,834
Rym: that's very Cosmo Kramer.

20
00:00:52,954 --> 00:00:53,476
Scott: I went to the.

21
00:00:53,797 --> 00:00:54,440
Scott: yeah pretty much.

22
00:00:55,504 --> 00:00:58,073
Scott: I went to the grocery last night and bought five oranges.

23
00:00:58,534 --> 00:01:01,915
Scott: and first of all, I gotta say Oranges are a bad deal.

24
00:01:02,861 --> 00:01:05,931
Scott: Orange juice is like expensive orange juice.

25
00:01:05,951 --> 00:01:07,696
Scott: It's like four dollars for like half a gallon.

26
00:01:07,937 --> 00:01:08,980
Scott: right for quality.

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,931
Rym: Oh, you want to make a half a gallon of orange juice from oranges right?

28
00:01:12,212 --> 00:01:14,480
Scott: five oranges was four dollars.

29
00:01:15,321 --> 00:01:17,148
Scott: Okay, and these aren't good Florida oranges.

30
00:01:17,188 --> 00:01:20,020
Scott: These are New York oranges that didn't have much flavor, right?

31
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,635
Scott: So I bring the orange in the shower and a. it's convenient because you just wash it right there.

32
00:01:24,675 --> 00:01:26,020
Scott: It's nice and clean, right?

33
00:01:26,982 --> 00:01:31,239
Scott: Yeah - it gives you something to do in the shower beside when you're like maybe waiting for.

34
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:32,467
Rym: well See the problem is right now.

35
00:01:32,487 --> 00:01:34,886
Rym: I got the waterproof cell phone So for the like.

36
00:01:34,906 --> 00:01:38,248
Rym: while I'm standing there for a few minutes every morning I'll actually just kind of read FARC.

37
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:40,017
Rym: then I'll get about my business.

38
00:01:40,339 --> 00:01:40,600
Scott: anyway.

39
00:01:42,601 --> 00:01:44,430
Scott: It was a little bit hard to peel the orange.

40
00:01:44,933 --> 00:01:50,237
Rym: I don't have like fingernails and I gotta go to got to do the clementine if you want to peel it with your hand.

41
00:01:50,358 --> 00:01:50,740
Scott: It's wet.

42
00:01:51,421 --> 00:01:52,304
Scott: So, but I did it.

43
00:01:52,465 --> 00:01:55,537
Rym: I'd recommend cutting an incision into the orange before you go into the.

44
00:01:55,557 --> 00:01:56,400
Scott: I don't want to link any.

45
00:01:56,501 --> 00:01:58,277
Scott: I want to leak any shower into the orange.

46
00:01:59,721 --> 00:02:01,349
Rym: No, I mean you're in the shower with the orange.

47
00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:03,640
Scott: you're gonna see if it gets on the outside of the orange.

48
00:02:03,841 --> 00:02:04,625
Scott: That's not a problem.

49
00:02:04,665 --> 00:02:07,680
Rym: But as soon as it gets inside the orange water, what else are you gonna get in there?

50
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,556
Scott: I don't want to eat soap.

51
00:02:09,799 --> 00:02:11,448
Rym: I Imagine you eat the orange like before.

52
00:02:11,488 --> 00:02:12,333
Rym: you're fully soaked up.

53
00:02:12,694 --> 00:02:18,380
Rym: Nah, whatever anyway Actually, we're gonna put a garbage disposal in the bottom of the shower.

54
00:02:18,481 --> 00:02:20,620
Scott: I just took the peels out with me and threw them in the garbage.

55
00:02:22,621 --> 00:02:25,520
Scott: So when I open the orange, oh so this keeps going.

56
00:02:26,787 --> 00:02:27,440
Scott: Yeah, all right.

57
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,652
Scott: So so so when I open the orange I began to understand why people like this.

58
00:02:31,712 --> 00:02:34,540
Scott: because it like the citrus odor just like went.

59
00:02:35,582 --> 00:02:40,320
Rym: And it was like you get that just by spraying like a puff of citrus saw while you're in there.

60
00:02:40,521 --> 00:02:41,668
Scott: Yes, you could but it was.

61
00:02:41,689 --> 00:02:43,460
Scott: it was from a real orange like it was so good.

62
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,474
Scott: But the problem was that I disappeared like in less than a second.

63
00:02:47,714 --> 00:02:49,340
Scott: It was like, oh, it's gone.

64
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,528
Rym: I guess gotta have a steady stream of oranges.

65
00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:54,480
Scott: Yeah, just keep opening oranges one after another on a conveyor belt.

66
00:02:56,323 --> 00:03:06,671
Scott: and then I started eating the orange and I was just eating an orange and eating it in the shower wasn't any different than eating it outside the shower except Because I sort of had to take a shower.

67
00:03:06,691 --> 00:03:08,240
Scott: I kind of ate it in a hurry.

68
00:03:08,562 --> 00:03:16,358
Scott: Well, yeah, cuz always if I'm eating it outside, I'm gonna eat it like oh Like one wedge at a time, right, but I'm in the shower and it's like I have to finish showering.

69
00:03:16,378 --> 00:03:18,726
Scott: so I'm like, oh Right.

70
00:03:18,786 --> 00:03:20,699
Scott: So it changes that the eating part.

71
00:03:21,682 --> 00:03:26,293
Rym: Unless you have time to take a forever shower Which I usually do I kind of make time for that.

72
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,600
Scott: Yeah, but this is a morning shower.

73
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,182
Scott: I want to see.

74
00:03:28,223 --> 00:03:35,960
Scott: I usually I've been taking more night showers, but because it was shower orange I took a morning shower on purpose because I figured that's what it'd be more effective.

75
00:03:36,801 --> 00:03:38,711
Scott: Anyway, who wants to eat an orange like late at night?

76
00:03:38,892 --> 00:03:40,520
Rym: Yeah, I already got a message for the stream quote.

77
00:03:40,661 --> 00:03:43,474
Rym: I feel mildly uncomfortable looking at this subreddit.

78
00:03:43,494 --> 00:03:53,969
Scott: So I I ate the orange and then I finished taking a shower and I think The shower orange is not really all it's cracked up to be.

79
00:03:54,330 --> 00:04:06,200
Scott: but I'm withholding judgment because I think if I had I got a good orange from like Florida a fresh quality or a big old like hey one of those heavy feeling oranges.

80
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,226
Scott: Oh, this is I got the right variety of orange.

81
00:04:08,307 --> 00:04:12,600
Scott: It just wasn't fresh and powerful and local and whatnot, right?

82
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,839
Scott: So it wasn't when I opened it like each wedge only had a little bit of flavor.

83
00:04:15,859 --> 00:04:18,151
Rym: now I'm already imagining there might be forget the shower.

84
00:04:18,231 --> 00:04:19,839
Rym: The shower is just a pale imitation.

85
00:04:20,262 --> 00:04:22,552
Rym: You need to be floating in the ocean eating the orange.

86
00:04:22,954 --> 00:04:23,255
Scott: Sure.

87
00:04:23,275 --> 00:04:24,862
Scott: That'd be great But it's just.

88
00:04:24,922 --> 00:04:36,180
Scott: I need an orange that maintains its citrusy power and makes the whole shower Orange flavored and not just you know a whiff of orange flavor followed by a few bites of orange flavor.

89
00:04:36,422 --> 00:04:43,520
Rym: Hey this I feel like an orange cough drop will suffice Possibly yeah, also I could just you know my shower.

90
00:04:44,022 --> 00:04:52,132
Scott: Currently, you know, the the flavor that it has is the flavor of Neutrogena rainbat Much better flavor than orange.

91
00:04:52,815 --> 00:04:53,860
Rym: Yeah, you don't want to drink that.

92
00:04:54,403 --> 00:04:55,368
Scott: No, I don't want to eat it.

93
00:04:55,448 --> 00:04:59,911
Scott: But I mean it when I as soon as I get the soap out That's the whole shower gets that soap flavor.

94
00:05:00,172 --> 00:05:00,735
Scott: and I had love.

95
00:05:00,876 --> 00:05:01,680
Scott: I use luxury hotel.

96
00:05:01,841 --> 00:05:04,473
Scott: So so it right and I don't really.

97
00:05:04,573 --> 00:05:07,284
Scott: if I wanted to replace that with orange I would just get orange.

98
00:05:07,324 --> 00:05:09,914
Rym: So see I use some service.

99
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,118
Scott: They definitely make that.

100
00:05:11,138 --> 00:05:14,549
Rym: Yeah I just use like scentless sort of like sea salty soap soap.

101
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,713
Scott: You haven't tried the rainbat.

102
00:05:16,355 --> 00:05:16,596
Rym: Yeah.

103
00:05:16,737 --> 00:05:17,680
Rym: Well, I haven't tried the orange.

104
00:05:19,362 --> 00:05:20,429
Scott: Orange is better than nothing.

105
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:27,825
Scott: But so I guess if I was in a Shower that didn't have like a flavor and I wanted to flavor it up I'd get an orange.

106
00:05:27,906 --> 00:05:29,657
Scott: or if I maybe if I maybe I'd go with the grapefruit.

107
00:05:29,697 --> 00:05:31,771
Scott: if I go Grapefruit is actually one of these.

108
00:05:32,175 --> 00:05:32,720
Rym: it's banned.

109
00:05:33,362 --> 00:05:37,977
Scott: There's a wide variety of permitted citrus and grapefruit is not permitted and I agree.

110
00:05:37,997 --> 00:05:43,560
Rym: cuz grapefruits are awful I feel like I should make the grapefruit only one grapefruit to shower grapefruit.

111
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,114
Scott: First of all this now you're getting the spoon in the shower.

112
00:05:46,134 --> 00:05:54,629
Scott: It's already a problem With your hands, yeah, you can know.

113
00:05:54,910 --> 00:06:03,721
Rym: the only thing stopping you is human decency And the fact that it makes a big mess, but in the shower also it tastes disgusting Amazing.

114
00:06:03,741 --> 00:06:04,083
Rym: It's great.

115
00:06:04,425 --> 00:06:04,706
Rym: Granted.

116
00:06:04,746 --> 00:06:05,952
Rym: I do not like eating raw grapefruit.

117
00:06:05,973 --> 00:06:07,380
Scott: I just drink hydrochloric acid.

118
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:15,881
Rym: So, uh in the news and there's a bunch of news but I actually I want to talk about this because I caught up 100%.

119
00:06:15,881 --> 00:06:18,572
Scott: we've done this news before though on adventure time.

120
00:06:18,592 --> 00:06:19,215
Scott: We've done this news.

121
00:06:19,335 --> 00:06:24,588
Rym: So I have a geek bite of Reviewing the the miniseries because adventure time is actually only done.

122
00:06:24,628 --> 00:06:27,776
Rym: two of these miniseries that are sort of standalone.

123
00:06:27,816 --> 00:06:33,190
Scott: They did snakes which is Name really a miniseries is what I'm saying.

124
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,173
Scott: It's just a more.

125
00:06:34,233 --> 00:06:37,060
Scott: it's more than two episodes that go together.

126
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:38,571
Rym: Well, I say more and more.

127
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:43,880
Rym: Yeah, it's a series of episodes But stakes sort of told its own story about Marceline start to finish there.

128
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:50,039
Rym: And what I think interesting about islands is that stakes just sort of like told this side story?

129
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:57,716
Rym: Islands is like say adventure time had not occurred up to this point and like the next season adventure time was starting like the beginning of a show.

130
00:06:58,682 --> 00:07:00,759
Rym: Islands is almost like the prequel to that.

131
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:13,520
Rym: Islands literally is Finn and a few other characters find out there might be humans somewhere and Go off as Susan strong to some islands to find out what happened to the last of the humans.

132
00:07:13,761 --> 00:07:16,015
Scott: It makes sense and it is not a spoiler.

133
00:07:16,055 --> 00:07:16,740
Scott: That's like obvious

134
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:37,478
Rym: Yeah, but it's deeply tied to the continuity and actually already I noticed some things in the background You know, although like in stakes and all these other things you see like other characters and flashbacks and in the background You see a lot of well corpses and items that indicate the statuses and dispositions and end states of a lot of those people.

135
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:53,074
Rym: and It gave me a lot of confidence that the last season of adventure time which is not the one that's on now It's the one that airs next year because islands just occurs in the middle of the current season Which just has more episodes that are coming out.

136
00:07:53,094 --> 00:08:00,160
Scott: at some point, I guess I'm sticking with my strategy of I stopped watching and I'm gonna watch again when the final episode comes out.

137
00:08:00,201 --> 00:08:02,105
Scott: I'm gonna go And be done.

138
00:08:02,466 --> 00:08:12,900
Rym: thing is I just started catching up because it's so good and I kind of forgot because Steven universe has been the Hotness lately and I like Steven universe my hurry, but adventure time Has quite a long-standing.

139
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:19,159
Rym: I don't know you of its own thing and I think adventure time is a top-tier show.

140
00:08:19,179 --> 00:08:24,967
Rym: and Reminded of that by watching a bunch of it again Okay, also it's gonna end.

141
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,880
Rym: so, you know your strategy shoes goose that I missed.

142
00:08:28,822 --> 00:08:31,796
Scott: Ah, I don't think there's any choose goose and there's no reason for me to hurry up.

143
00:08:31,817 --> 00:08:32,419
Scott: I can just wait.

144
00:08:32,861 --> 00:08:35,371
Rym: However, you you say this is your strategy.

145
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:35,974
Rym: What are you gonna read?

146
00:08:36,014 --> 00:08:36,294
Rym: Dr.

147
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:39,004
Rym: McNinchy because it is 100% done.

148
00:08:39,245 --> 00:08:41,474
Scott: as soon as I get a chance probably real soon.

149
00:08:41,495 --> 00:08:42,760
Rym: Yeah, you can just blow through it.

150
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,360
Rym: I mean, it's you know, King radical was up to something and you're just gonna.

151
00:08:47,082 --> 00:08:52,133
Rym: Obviously, it's pretty good and it's a hundred hundred hundred hundred percent over.

152
00:08:52,153 --> 00:08:53,196
Rym: there will be never more.

153
00:08:53,216 --> 00:08:55,341
Scott: not even one more page of Dr.

154
00:08:55,381 --> 00:08:56,846
Scott: McNinchy will ever be created.

155
00:08:57,067 --> 00:09:03,275
Rym: In fact, if you go to the site now, it shows the first page of dr McNinchy and it warns you not to click back.

156
00:09:03,496 --> 00:09:04,964
Rym: Hmm All right.

157
00:09:05,265 --> 00:09:06,411
Rym: So you got any any news?

158
00:09:06,793 --> 00:09:07,556
Scott: Oh, I do have a news.

159
00:09:07,938 --> 00:09:12,919
Scott: So You know a lot of people have not seen as much Gundam as I've seen.

160
00:09:13,704 --> 00:09:16,260
Scott: But maybe they're not opposed to seeing some Gundam, right?

161
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,380
Scott: Maybe they're like, oh, you know, I do kind of want to see some Gundams, but I don't know which ones to watch.

162
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,267
Scott: There's so many I don't understand right?

163
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:28,994
Scott: Well, how convenient Hulu, which I recently Suspended my subscription because at South Park isn't on right now.

164
00:09:29,114 --> 00:09:29,315
Rym: Yep.

165
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:30,520
Rym: I had also pause my Hulu.

166
00:09:30,681 --> 00:09:32,780
Rym: I got a c-roll going and I got the Netflix going.

167
00:09:32,841 --> 00:09:35,020
Scott: I only have c-roll right now because I'm watching you all paddle.

168
00:09:35,861 --> 00:09:42,360
Scott: I might turn it back on because they just added to Hulu five Gundams and there are five excellent Gundams.

169
00:09:42,761 --> 00:09:46,512
Scott: Gundam seed which is the HD version that does not even have dub.

170
00:09:46,572 --> 00:09:47,615
Scott: It's subtitle only.

171
00:09:48,016 --> 00:09:49,320
Rym: I could almost watch that again.

172
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,547
Scott: Go just go right for it.

173
00:09:50,568 --> 00:09:51,513
Scott: Just go right into that.

174
00:09:52,077 --> 00:09:55,400
Scott: No problem They also got Gundam the origin which I kind of want.

175
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,753
Scott: That's the one I would resubscribe to see because I read.

176
00:09:57,773 --> 00:10:02,672
Scott: I read the all the manga But I haven't seen the anime of Gundam the origin or 8th MS team.

177
00:10:03,074 --> 00:10:04,880
Scott: I got 8th MS team, which is way short.

178
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,487
Scott: How many episodes is it like?

179
00:10:06,528 --> 00:10:07,934
Rym: like 8 not many?

180
00:10:08,035 --> 00:10:09,140
Scott: It's not a lot of episodes.

181
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,537
Scott: You can watch this marathon that crab go watch this shit in a day even though there's actually 12 12 episodes.

182
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:17,474
Scott: So that's like a one-day show, you know, you can watch it in like a week.

183
00:10:17,495 --> 00:10:18,640
Scott: You watch an episode every day.

184
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,879
Rym: It's like a whole arc of utenna.

185
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,218
Scott: Yeah Just watch two episodes every day and you'll see all of 8th MS team one of the best Gundams there is.

186
00:10:24,258 --> 00:10:25,263
Scott: it's on Hulu Right now.

187
00:10:25,685 --> 00:10:28,720
Scott: all of these are sub and dub except for Gundam seed, which is sub only.

188
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:35,763
Scott: Gundam wing the one that was on Cartoon Network one that I never watched all the way through in order I only see.

189
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:38,460
Scott: the only thing I've seen all the way through is the movie with the two mix music.

190
00:10:38,561 --> 00:10:39,829
Scott: I never saw the whole TV show.

191
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,520
Rym: all the way to show also has to mix music.

192
00:10:41,621 --> 00:10:46,613
Scott: I mean if I watched Gundam the origin Maybe I'll actually do that and watch Gundam wing all the way through in order.

193
00:10:46,653 --> 00:10:48,580
Rym: and then what do you think the plot of Gundam?

194
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,105
Rym: Wing is.

195
00:10:49,569 --> 00:10:50,779
Scott: so I'm just curious.

196
00:10:51,321 --> 00:10:55,215
Scott: There's a bunch of kids on a planet and there's some sort of war.

197
00:10:55,235 --> 00:10:56,579
Scott: There's an evil government.

198
00:10:57,182 --> 00:10:57,583
Rym: That's all.

199
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,591
Rym: the good guys are the bad guys.

200
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:01,580
Scott: kids are the good guys, but some of them are bad guys.

201
00:11:01,921 --> 00:11:10,013
Scott: are they and the kids get Gundams one Gundam per kid and There's that girl who's like, you know, basically Princess Leia.

202
00:11:10,033 --> 00:11:10,957
Scott: she's like in the government.

203
00:11:10,977 --> 00:11:11,780
Scott: She's like as Klein.

204
00:11:11,961 --> 00:11:17,040
Scott: Yeah, yeah, and then there's a dude who's not char, but he's char and they must fight in space.

205
00:11:19,002 --> 00:11:20,309
Rym: Except I think they mostly fight.

206
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:22,037
Rym: I think they also fight on the planet a lot.

207
00:11:22,178 --> 00:11:23,360
Scott: Yeah, sure They do that every Gundam.

208
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:23,984
Scott: That's how it works.

209
00:11:24,064 --> 00:11:27,259
Scott: and then this is dramatic part where you go into space and a dramatic part We come out of space.

210
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:28,105
Rym: I gotta say so.

211
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,432
Rym: if you three entries hell.

212
00:11:29,673 --> 00:11:34,317
Rym: if you have never seen Any Gundam somehow despite listening to GeekNights you can.

213
00:11:34,338 --> 00:11:34,800
Scott: that's the best.

214
00:11:34,882 --> 00:11:35,540
Scott: This is what I'm saying.

215
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:42,260
Scott: Is that all of these Gundams including the one I didn't mention yet Gundam double-o Which I have only seen a couple episodes of but I've never actually seen it.

216
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:46,360
Scott: So, I don't know if it's any good or not because they've only seen two episodes and those weren't bad.

217
00:11:46,841 --> 00:11:48,065
Scott: Is it any of these Gundams?

218
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:52,960
Scott: are Gundams that you can just watch right away with no Gundam knowledge whatsoever?

219
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,093
Scott: Yeah, you don't need to know nothing about no Gundams.

220
00:11:56,394 --> 00:11:57,560
Scott: So I pick any one of these.

221
00:11:58,024 --> 00:11:58,972
Scott: You can just start from episode.

222
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:03,336
Rym: one of any of these I'm not even talking like oh, there's all this backstory.

223
00:12:03,376 --> 00:12:04,040
Rym: That won't matter.

224
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,010
Scott: Like no, you can literally start from episode one of any of these.

225
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:07,331
Scott: Yep.

226
00:12:07,652 --> 00:12:07,953
Rym: Got him.

227
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:10,060
Rym: seed introduces the concept of a Gundam.

228
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,308
Scott: Maybe Gundam the origin would be.

229
00:12:12,368 --> 00:12:15,880
Scott: I don't know if it like retails the whole thing or if it's just the parts that weren't.

230
00:12:16,122 --> 00:12:20,206
Scott: I don't know enough about it to say that for sure, but all the other ones Yeah, you can just start watching from nothing.

231
00:12:20,367 --> 00:12:26,487
Rym: if I had to recommend I'd recommend Gundam seed Because it's better.

232
00:12:26,567 --> 00:12:31,120
Scott: but Gundam seed will tell you gonna make the mess team is the best of these that I know of.

233
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:35,454
Scott: Yeah, but gonna see like accessible Gundam seed is giving you.

234
00:12:35,614 --> 00:12:37,581
Scott: that is what all the other Gundams are Like.

235
00:12:37,621 --> 00:12:44,272
Scott: if you watch Gundam seed and then you go back and watch the original Gundam you be like, hey This is real similar to Gundam seed only like different characters.

236
00:12:44,332 --> 00:12:46,320
Scott: It's like yeah, that's how Gundam is.

237
00:12:47,123 --> 00:12:48,488
Rym: Yeah, wait, there's a mascot.

238
00:12:48,528 --> 00:12:49,070
Rym: what's going on?

239
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:50,455
Scott: And then you watch Gundam wing you'd like.

240
00:12:50,475 --> 00:12:51,198
Scott: this is really some.

241
00:12:51,218 --> 00:12:56,760
Scott: yeah The same story retold with characters of different names and different looking robots.

242
00:12:57,021 --> 00:12:58,447
Rym: Well, except war in the pocket is just.

243
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:03,413
Scott: war is sad war in the pockets even shorter than a semester Where the pocket is like one shot.

244
00:13:03,433 --> 00:13:06,208
Scott: It's like a movie basically Yeah, but anyway, but any of these are.

245
00:13:06,329 --> 00:13:08,640
Scott: all of these were like excellent choices to put up on the Hulu.

246
00:13:08,801 --> 00:13:14,940
Scott: So if you want to see Gundams your anime fan sign up for Hulu with the no ad version, you know.

247
00:13:15,001 --> 00:13:16,654
Scott: And then watch a Gundam and then turn it off.

248
00:13:16,675 --> 00:13:19,359
Scott: See you stop paying Cuz you don't want to pay for it even that you.

249
00:13:25,412 --> 00:13:28,730
Rym: So I use Twitter a lot and you keep tabs on Twitter.

250
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,196
Rym: Like I check it pretty much all day.

251
00:13:30,377 --> 00:13:38,834
Scott: I read every single goddamn tweet Yep, and I have done so since I started using Twitter for real Tweet.

252
00:13:38,975 --> 00:13:40,043
Rym: I'm muting for a little while.

253
00:13:40,104 --> 00:13:47,652
Scott: every single tweet If anyone I follow is seen by my eyes and read and if I don't like tweets I unfollowed Aggressively.

254
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:48,074
Scott: Yep.

255
00:13:48,636 --> 00:13:51,790
Scott: There's probably a bunch of people I follow that never tweet and I don't see any of their tweets.

256
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:52,594
Scott: I don't unfollow them.

257
00:13:52,654 --> 00:14:00,508
Scott: But if someone tweets badly or too much I unfollow Yep, and I it's tough now because I follow new things very rarely.

258
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:06,367
Rym: Yep I just followed a new account a new ish account at least that it uses emoji to everyday tweet.

259
00:14:06,648 --> 00:14:08,896
Rym: one like Randomized roguelike dungeon.

260
00:14:08,976 --> 00:14:15,579
Scott: I recently discovered the Darwin Awards this Twitter account that constantly post focus Lou is retweeting that about people hurting themselves.

261
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:18,870
Scott: Yeah, and they're very funny, but there's too many of them sung and unfollow.

262
00:14:19,071 --> 00:14:33,079
Rym: Yeah, I trust a few I don't need like one of those a day not you know, ten Yep, but so last night around the same time Casey Green and Emi Sisorega Both tweeted these horrific cats.

263
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:42,130
Rym: I saw these cats pretty much all morning this morning Yep, so I basically went and retweeted everyone in my feed who interacted with this thing and then I interacted with it.

264
00:14:42,692 --> 00:14:46,230
Rym: It is it's a neural network like learning experiment.

265
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:48,985
Rym: There's a bunch of other practical stuff on this site like this.

266
00:14:49,065 --> 00:15:01,590
Rym: one here is about Identifying the components of facades unlike buildings Like imagine that for like drone delivery, but it's neural networks figuring out what something is or interacting with it from training.

267
00:15:02,353 --> 00:15:10,365
Rym: but this one is trained to look at edges like lines like vector art and Find the cats or in this case what Scott drew the dick.

268
00:15:12,032 --> 00:15:17,990
Scott: Why don't we do this except instead of cats dicks and so usable under porn is the here's edges to shoes edges to hand.

269
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:19,309
Scott: Why don't we do edges to dicks?

270
00:15:20,551 --> 00:15:21,414
Rym: Why why not?

271
00:15:21,474 --> 00:15:22,739
Rym: Let's learn this.

272
00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:23,181
Rym: Let's see.

273
00:15:23,241 --> 00:15:24,767
Rym: So it uses tensorflow.

274
00:15:24,787 --> 00:15:28,640
Rym: chair We can learn that pretty easily make edges to dicks.

275
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:28,981
Rym: I read it.

276
00:15:29,021 --> 00:15:30,245
Scott: You want advertisement on it.

277
00:15:30,265 --> 00:15:30,928
Scott: You'll make a fortune.

278
00:15:31,108 --> 00:15:33,930
Rym: I read I read a tutorial on tensorflow.

279
00:15:34,091 --> 00:15:36,806
Scott: I tried to read a tutorial on it and it said dude all this math.

280
00:15:36,866 --> 00:15:39,684
Scott: and I said fuck you You're supposed to do the math for me and I didn't understand it.

281
00:15:39,845 --> 00:15:42,267
Scott: just to dicks?

282
00:15:44,024 --> 00:15:47,621
Rym: Yes It does not yet exist.

283
00:15:48,144 --> 00:15:51,169
Rym: Yes Feel the hatred flow.

284
00:15:52,154 --> 00:15:53,560
Scott: When then it must have a counterpart.

285
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,504
Scott: it just to boobs.

286
00:15:54,926 --> 00:15:57,430
Rym: No, it's just dicks Just dicks also boobs.

287
00:15:57,611 --> 00:16:13,524
Rym: Anyway, if you draw or attempt to draw a cat of some kind into this thing it will use machine learning and the height of modern technology to find the cat in it and This has already taken over Twitter for like three days.

288
00:16:13,544 --> 00:16:17,379
Rym: so you can just go enjoy it and Everyone will forget about it in like a week.

289
00:16:17,721 --> 00:16:18,827
Scott: Okay, is that it?

290
00:16:19,048 --> 00:16:19,310
Scott: That's it.

291
00:16:19,652 --> 00:16:22,569
Scott: So back when we were in college, we went to hockey games.

292
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:32,002
Scott: Yep, and you know sporting events at colleges, you know, the crowds are smaller The crowds are more rabid and dedicated and well organized and they're more.

293
00:16:32,063 --> 00:16:38,130
Scott: it's the same people every time right who are going to every Single game it's not and sitting in the same place every single game.

294
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:42,590
Scott: Not like a professional sporting event where there's thousands of people who are mostly there like one shot.

295
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,059
Scott: It's the only game they're gonna see that season.

296
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,226
Scott: your gear ever, right?

297
00:16:45,648 --> 00:16:58,100
Scott: So We used to do all sorts of organized chanting to mess with the goalie of the other team primarily Yeah, and also enjoy ourselves more Skate skate, but this is not unique to hockey.

298
00:16:58,401 --> 00:17:06,194
Scott: It also happens in the baseball and here is the best one I've seen of the baseball And Yeah, it's Texas.

299
00:17:06,255 --> 00:17:07,078
Scott: So fuck them.

300
00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:08,925
Scott: But hey, good job.

301
00:17:09,789 --> 00:17:10,534
Scott: I Enjoy this.

302
00:17:10,595 --> 00:17:11,180
Scott: keep doing it.

303
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:18,810
Rym: I am amazed Not that they do this because you know, like you said this is a kind of common thing the sheer persistence of this particular.

304
00:17:19,752 --> 00:17:22,930
Scott: I'm not amazed that if we had a thing like that at RIT, would we have persisted?

305
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:26,308
Rym: But we I mean the corner crew like to get the corner going and you could get.

306
00:17:26,387 --> 00:17:26,710
Rym: it's true.

307
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,470
Scott: They have an entire baseball stadium going which is much larger than a little corner crew.

308
00:17:30,691 --> 00:17:30,931
Scott: Yeah,

309
00:17:30,972 --> 00:17:36,170
Rym: like this this is the kind of thing where you imagine like a mother teaching her daughter like listen

310
00:17:36,571 --> 00:17:42,846
Scott: I also think it's easier to persist when you have that many people because like you can take a break and then someone else takes A break and you get back into it.

311
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,850
Rym: But there's also a fine line where the more people you have the more possibility of fracture.

312
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:49,174
Rym: I mean look at a Rangers game You can't get.

313
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:53,650
Rym: let's go Rangers going consistently for more than like two runs of it tops.

314
00:17:53,891 --> 00:17:55,055
Scott: It's very it's not easy.

315
00:17:55,315 --> 00:17:56,620
Rym: Like you started let's go Rangers.

316
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,710
Rym: The dude fucking next to you will be out of sync immediately.

317
00:18:00,072 --> 00:18:03,405
Rym: Yeah, so Texas A&M my head is off to you.

318
00:18:03,466 --> 00:18:04,369
Rym: That's not bad.

319
00:18:05,573 --> 00:18:08,873
Rym: in the meta moment the book club book is Frank Herbert's.

320
00:18:09,314 --> 00:18:13,184
Scott: do not hide it because we've never done a we.

321
00:18:13,224 --> 00:18:15,390
Rym: neither one of us has actually read it all the way through.

322
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:18,623
Rym: We just know a lot about dune because that's kind of pop culture II.

323
00:18:18,704 --> 00:18:20,170
Rym: but we don't know it that well.

324
00:18:20,431 --> 00:18:23,049
Rym: Like I know way more about the wheel of time than I do about dune.

325
00:18:23,777 --> 00:18:24,869
Scott: So I guess that's true.

326
00:18:26,113 --> 00:18:35,201
Rym: In fact because I've read all of the wheel of time I'm in that club of people who know about the wheel of time and I understand now why those people Always want to talk to other people about wheel of time.

327
00:18:35,262 --> 00:18:37,270
Scott: So you want to join the dune club do know?

328
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:39,069
Rym: I'm reading the first book of dune.

329
00:18:39,591 --> 00:18:48,029
Rym: I am confident that even though somehow I read all of wheel of time from that first book we did I am confident I will not have the desire to read the second dune book.

330
00:18:48,653 --> 00:18:51,046
Scott: Well, I didn't have the desire to read the first dune book in middle school.

331
00:18:51,066 --> 00:18:51,790
Scott: So let's find out.

332
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:52,914
Rym: Yeah, so we'll see.

333
00:18:53,617 --> 00:19:02,916
Rym: we're going to be live real soon on Friday Not this week not next week But the following week Friday at 6 p.m.

334
00:19:02,937 --> 00:19:05,243
Rym: In the bumblebee theater redoing a panel at PAX East.

335
00:19:05,563 --> 00:19:07,288
Rym: play dirty to win.

336
00:19:07,489 --> 00:19:23,263
Rym: and Let me tell you that that panel already got to the point where there is a line and beyond that line are additional slides Of winning techniques that even I will not use Panel I think I got.

337
00:19:23,303 --> 00:19:24,512
Rym: I got a Cuz.

338
00:19:24,593 --> 00:19:25,216
Rym: I was like here.

339
00:19:25,256 --> 00:19:28,934
Rym: here's the panel to Scott and Scott was like no no, no, you need to push it You need to go deeper.

340
00:19:28,954 --> 00:19:31,745
Rym: That's right, and we went deeper and it's still going deep.

341
00:19:32,026 --> 00:19:33,190
Rym: The bottom is not there yet.

342
00:19:33,492 --> 00:19:35,808
Rym: I think the bottom might be actually kill your opponent.

343
00:19:37,031 --> 00:19:43,329
Rym: No, like yeah, but like ahead of time so they don't show up to the tournament and you get a bye in the second round anyway.

344
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:57,406
Rym: Otherwise, you should follow me and Scott on YouTube and we're doing a thing because in the last 12 years We have done a lot of Game nights episodes and a lot of those happen to be reviews of board games.

345
00:19:57,889 --> 00:20:10,070
Rym: However While many people might particularly enjoy our style of board game review I feel like very few people who review games actually go to the depth that we go into or A lot of them are often wrong about things.

346
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:14,750
Rym: But anyway, I think our board game reviews are pretty good, but they're buried under all that other crap that happens.

347
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:18,124
Rym: Let's talk about cat dicks and you know edges to dicks and all that nonsense.

348
00:20:18,747 --> 00:20:29,630
Rym: So I'm taking Every single board game review we have ever done and putting them on YouTube with just Slideshows of images of the games and just the board game review and nothing else.

349
00:20:29,851 --> 00:20:33,406
Scott: Why would you want to listen to audio on YouTube when you could get the mp3?

350
00:20:33,627 --> 00:20:34,350
Scott: you just skip ahead?

351
00:20:35,631 --> 00:20:37,018
Rym: So skip ahead to where I don't.

352
00:20:37,098 --> 00:20:39,530
Rym: it's not like there's a time code saying because we could figure it out.

353
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:41,722
Scott: You listen for the thing of the day part and then you you know, what do you mean?

354
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:42,285
Rym: listen for?

355
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:43,250
Rym: that already means like scroll?

356
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:44,595
Rym: Forward nope scroll.

357
00:20:44,715 --> 00:20:44,976
Rym: Nope.

358
00:20:45,117 --> 00:20:45,378
Rym: Nope.

359
00:20:45,518 --> 00:20:46,040
Rym: Nope.

360
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:46,321
Rym: Okay.

361
00:20:46,341 --> 00:20:47,204
Rym: Now there's that music.

362
00:20:47,626 --> 00:20:48,710
Rym: They're still talking about dicks.

363
00:20:50,131 --> 00:20:50,976
Scott: Someone wants to do that.

364
00:20:50,996 --> 00:20:52,625
Scott: That's on them, but no one's gonna do that.

365
00:20:53,871 --> 00:21:02,784
Rym: Also, it is difficult to unless I make a separate podcast feed of just the main bits Most people can't be asked and most people don't even realize the podcast.

366
00:21:02,924 --> 00:21:03,647
Scott: Well, that's good.

367
00:21:03,687 --> 00:21:04,670
Scott: They shouldn't didn't waste time?

368
00:21:05,451 --> 00:21:07,120
Rym: No, so YouTube feels like a better way for this.

369
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:14,341
Rym: Plus that's the kind of thing that'll actually get Shared if someone's like hey play this game They'll actually link to a YouTube but they're not gonna link to.

370
00:21:14,381 --> 00:21:16,289
Scott: you're gonna link to a YouTube that just shows images.

371
00:21:17,534 --> 00:21:18,866
Rym: They seem to be popular already.

372
00:21:19,952 --> 00:21:21,949
Rym: People are said that's how things go.

373
00:21:22,332 --> 00:21:29,485
Rym: So what I say to you is if you like our board game reviews You should check this out and send these to the people, you know, who are too dumb to listen to podcasts.

374
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:31,977
Rym: I Think that's it.

375
00:21:32,017 --> 00:21:35,511
Rym: We can talk about the dragon show Dragon.

376
00:21:35,531 --> 00:21:39,627
Rym: yeah, I've been watching other anime which Scott hasn't and I'm not watching yo a pedal.

377
00:21:39,767 --> 00:21:40,490
Scott: I'm like a pedal.

378
00:21:40,671 --> 00:21:41,133
Rym: I think I'm.

379
00:21:41,253 --> 00:21:45,715
Rym: uh, I don't have anything else to say about yo a paddle It's nothing.

380
00:21:45,735 --> 00:21:46,519
Scott: there's nothing new to say.

381
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,505
Scott: It's just more of the same.

382
00:21:47,525 --> 00:21:53,076
Rym: I mean, it's like Initial D Like I didn't even watch all of initially.

383
00:21:53,117 --> 00:21:54,782
Rym: I kind of stopped around fourth stage.

384
00:21:54,842 --> 00:21:56,589
Rym: It's just kept going and stop.

385
00:21:56,629 --> 00:22:01,160
Rym: Karen Pons are really good, but you haven't watched any of that stuff.

386
00:22:01,381 --> 00:22:03,130
Scott: So anyway, it's Dragon Maid show.

387
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:04,730
Scott: So everyone was talking about the Dragon Maid show.

388
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:07,298
Scott: we got mentioned to me by like multiple people.

389
00:22:07,419 --> 00:22:11,614
Rym: it filled my Twitter feed like to a degree that I was shocked by Like.

390
00:22:11,735 --> 00:22:16,872
Rym: I just out of nowhere for like a week nothing with dragons in my Twitter feed and Then it went away.

391
00:22:16,932 --> 00:22:21,390
Rym: and actually as of now the thing that's filling my Twitter feed is that kimono friend show.

392
00:22:21,771 --> 00:22:22,414
Scott: I don't know what that is.

393
00:22:22,434 --> 00:22:26,310
Rym: But anyway, that's animal people, but it's kind of like a dameko dobe.

394
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,195
Rym: It's the one that we.

395
00:22:27,255 --> 00:22:27,878
Scott: that's a good thing.

396
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,895
Rym: It's the thing that we assumed doing Judge anime by its cover.

397
00:22:32,216 --> 00:22:35,525
Rym: that it was gonna be a worse version of dameko dobutsu.

398
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:36,568
Scott: is it so?

399
00:22:36,768 --> 00:22:37,089
Rym: I don't know.

400
00:22:37,591 --> 00:22:46,890
Rym: But it has got some Twitter staying power and a lot of people are saying no It looks low production value and not that good but stick with it a few episodes and everyone's like flipping out about this show.

401
00:22:47,292 --> 00:22:48,640
Scott: So anyway, Dragon Maid.

402
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,310
Scott: I heard about Dragon Maid from multiple people.

403
00:22:50,691 --> 00:22:55,350
Scott: So I said well ice multiple people have said something and friends are coming over.

404
00:22:55,530 --> 00:23:00,646
Scott: So let's watch this thing because Natalie was already way into it and Judith hadn't seen any.

405
00:23:00,727 --> 00:23:04,721
Rym: so yep I mean I were like, well, I like dragons.

406
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:07,290
Scott: We watched every episode that was on crunchyroll.

407
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:19,630
Scott: so the first thing about the show is it's made by the same studio that made lucky star and a bunch of garbage and The show is just like every other show that they've made Right, so

408
00:23:20,571 --> 00:23:25,590
Rym: Now I really I do like lucky star but that that those kinds of shows are not forever.

409
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:29,950
Rym: Those are the kinds of shows like Excel saga where your friend who's away.

410
00:23:30,131 --> 00:23:31,818
Scott: This isn't as crazy as that.

411
00:23:31,858 --> 00:23:38,350
Rym: Yeah, but your friend is way into anime tries to get you to watch it But yet it's really only for people who are way in and it is deaf.

412
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:53,930
Rym: This show is definitely for only people who are into anime first of all, but this this show Kobayashi So, you know made a dragon is for people who are into monster girls Moe but like edging into moe not like not like current moe.

413
00:23:54,211 --> 00:23:57,602
Rym: This is like it's like one step away from getting into the creepy stuff.

414
00:23:57,702 --> 00:24:06,990
Rym: Yeah, and you also are in The girl the tiny girl dragon, yeah, but at least as far as I only watched the first four episodes they haven't gone.

415
00:24:10,836 --> 00:24:12,330
Scott: So I don't wanna say the show is bad.

416
00:24:12,491 --> 00:24:14,520
Scott: Right because it's like it's.

417
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,946
Rym: it's good enough to where like.

418
00:24:15,986 --> 00:24:17,112
Rym: I kept watching it I didn't.

419
00:24:17,153 --> 00:24:19,490
Scott: it's a. I watched it because that's what we were doing.

420
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:22,229
Scott: I wouldn't I wouldn't personally wouldn't have gone past episode like two.

421
00:24:22,571 --> 00:24:27,507
Scott: But like it's good at what it is is but what it is is not a thing.

422
00:24:27,547 --> 00:24:27,989
Scott: I want.

423
00:24:28,209 --> 00:24:28,934
Scott: Yeah It's.

424
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:30,465
Scott: it's like there are some funny bits.

425
00:24:30,525 --> 00:24:36,404
Scott: for example There's the evil dragon guy fat after and it's like he is a funny.

426
00:24:36,665 --> 00:24:38,450
Scott: is his character is a funny joke, right?

427
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:39,329
Scott: He's an evil dragon.

428
00:24:39,451 --> 00:24:48,343
Rym: He's dark and you know He wants to like in the first episode where she calls him for advice and he's just like kill all the human kill all Who see your treasure trust?

429
00:24:48,424 --> 00:24:49,150
Rym: No one kill?

430
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:52,619
Scott: It's like he is a play likes to play video games.

431
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:56,290
Scott: It's like that's a funny character, but that joke gets old.

432
00:24:56,551 --> 00:24:59,650
Scott: It's only funny like two times and then he's not funny anymore.

433
00:24:59,891 --> 00:25:04,203
Scott: He's just did right and there's a lot of boobs and stuff which it's like.

434
00:25:04,303 --> 00:25:06,550
Scott: at my limit of tolerance for boobiness.

435
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,743
Rym: I'm like, alright, it's definitely at the limit like it's at.

436
00:25:09,763 --> 00:25:13,603
Scott: it's like if there's any more fan service I would like burn this with fire, but it's like.

437
00:25:13,663 --> 00:25:15,734
Scott: alright, that's the most fan service I can take without hurting.

438
00:25:15,774 --> 00:25:21,617
Rym: so on one hand it is refreshing that it's two girls But on the other hand it is.

439
00:25:21,637 --> 00:25:24,185
Rym: it is definitely at least 50% male gazey.

440
00:25:24,225 --> 00:25:26,233
Scott: Yeah It's not.

441
00:25:26,273 --> 00:25:27,160
Scott: there is the thing right?

442
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,510
Scott: It would be cool.

443
00:25:28,872 --> 00:25:32,910
Scott: It's cool that it's like a lesbian action right the female dragon and the female human.

444
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:34,795
Rym: Yeah, but I like how she is like.

445
00:25:34,835 --> 00:25:40,010
Rym: the normal girl is kind of just like this nerdy programmer normal person, right?

446
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:46,770
Scott: The problem is is they at least in the five episodes worth they don't make it explicit, right?

447
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:50,350
Scott: It's like just the dragon girl is obviously all over the regular girl.

448
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:59,044
Scott: There's nothing on explicit about that, but the regular girl is not Reciprocating in any way other than allowing allowing her to live in the house.

449
00:25:59,546 --> 00:26:00,850
Rym: She holds your hand a little bit.

450
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:03,959
Rym: She puts up with their crap when he's holding the hand.

451
00:26:03,999 --> 00:26:07,430
Scott: It's not like who holding the hand like my love story.

452
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:09,083
Scott: It's holding the hand like come with me.

453
00:26:09,164 --> 00:26:09,970
Scott: Stop messing around.

454
00:26:10,731 --> 00:26:12,879
Rym: They're just really good friends, right?

455
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:13,320
Rym: I don't know.

456
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:22,665
Rym: I mean think if we haven't seen not like I don't know where it goes I don't know if it has like an explicit end, but it's like it's got a They had in order to make that like, you know excusable.

457
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:23,890
Scott: they got across that line.

458
00:26:24,212 --> 00:26:38,574
Scott: Okay, I will give you the credit now that you you know, set it out loud But if you just sort of keep it on the down-low You're basically, you know, just leaving it for male gaziness and I can't give you credit just for pretending or alluding to Right some Yuri.

459
00:26:38,595 --> 00:26:42,370
Scott: Yeah, you gotta give me you gotta actually give Yuri or you don't get credit for it.

460
00:26:42,612 --> 00:26:44,530
Rym: So there seems to also be an undercurrent.

461
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:48,921
Rym: I'm looking at kind of what's coming up down the show and also I guess it was better There's some manga that I can look at.

462
00:26:49,002 --> 00:26:50,250
Rym: I'm sure there see where it's going.

463
00:26:50,753 --> 00:26:55,737
Rym: It seems like there is actually a plot around dragons Hiding the dragon world.

464
00:26:55,757 --> 00:26:59,450
Rym: There's some sort of war among the dragons and some nonsense going on.

465
00:26:59,872 --> 00:27:03,070
Rym: So bit by bit these dragons get attracted here, but it might go somewhere.

466
00:27:03,532 --> 00:27:05,820
Scott: Thank you for mentioning the best part of this show.

467
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:11,290
Scott: much like fancy Lala which has a plot about dinosaurs Dragon maid has a plot about dragons.

468
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:23,288
Scott: They alert to it showing you that like when the dragon met the maid like she was dying Sort of like Excalibur this big-ass awesome sword stabbed in her and she was wounded and she got healed.

469
00:27:23,348 --> 00:27:25,215
Scott: and she doesn't want to Go back to the dragon world.

470
00:27:25,255 --> 00:27:28,469
Scott: and the dragon world is fully humans, you know magic and fight with dragons and dude.

471
00:27:29,533 --> 00:27:30,870
Scott: Why did you make this garbage show?

472
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:36,167
Scott: You could have just given me a show about that dragon world a fantasy show and cut out all this maid bullshit.

473
00:27:36,267 --> 00:27:42,423
Rym: if season two were the Dragons come and fuck up this world or You just give me the oh, I'll go back to the other world.

474
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:43,971
Scott: It's like.

475
00:27:44,112 --> 00:27:51,420
Scott: all I care about is the stuff happening in the fantasy world with the Wizards the Knights and the actual Dragon form dragons breathing fire on them.

476
00:27:52,042 --> 00:27:55,194
Scott: if that was 90% of the show I would watch that.

477
00:27:55,636 --> 00:27:59,490
Scott: but it's only like 1% of this show and that's the part that's like.

478
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:02,481
Scott: Oh, it's like just give me tidbits of the good stuff.

479
00:28:02,641 --> 00:28:02,902
Scott: Yep.

480
00:28:03,043 --> 00:28:06,730
Scott: It's like someone else is watching the show thinking Oh, man, the boobs are the good stuff.

481
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:13,517
Scott: No I don't care about that sword business and that's a person who I should take a sword to Get you an anime that can do both.

482
00:28:13,537 --> 00:28:15,583
Scott: Yeah, but this doesn't do both.

483
00:28:15,664 --> 00:28:17,590
Scott: It just pretends to do what right?

484
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:20,970
Scott: It's like if it did even half the show was about the other dragon world.

485
00:28:21,242 --> 00:28:21,988
Scott: Yeah I'd be down.

486
00:28:22,491 --> 00:28:27,105
Scott: But it's like you get one second if you're lucky of other dragon world in each episode.

487
00:28:27,145 --> 00:28:29,736
Scott: now on the other hand that does and I don't Got I don't got time for that.

488
00:28:29,797 --> 00:28:31,890
Scott: I could just watch an actual fantasy anime.

489
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:36,267
Rym: Well like dragon half if you if you want dragon girl, I guess layers again.

490
00:28:36,287 --> 00:28:38,737
Rym: Yeah Well, you've never seen the slayers.

491
00:28:38,777 --> 00:28:39,861
Rym: that actually has dragons in it.

492
00:28:40,021 --> 00:28:42,250
Scott: I could I could watch that instead of dragon.

493
00:28:42,453 --> 00:28:43,490
Scott: Actually, I'll be a great choice.

494
00:28:43,671 --> 00:28:45,056
Rym: We should cuz you me and Emily cuz.

495
00:28:45,097 --> 00:28:47,607
Rym: you guys had never seen slayers next and remember.

496
00:28:47,627 --> 00:28:48,270
Rym: so we watched it.

497
00:28:48,712 --> 00:28:52,049
Rym: I've got all of Laura's DVDs still of slayers try which is the next season.

498
00:28:52,551 --> 00:28:53,133
Scott: Let's watch that.

499
00:28:53,173 --> 00:28:56,703
Rym: then you know, the plot is dragon slave the plot of slayers.

500
00:28:56,764 --> 00:28:58,489
Scott: try it kind of like what I try to do.

501
00:28:59,251 --> 00:29:08,630
Rym: Uh, so you find out that for all of slayers up to this point the world they're in There's an edge to it and it seems like it's been surrounded by this magic shield.

502
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:13,010
Rym: No one can get in or out and the shield suddenly disappears and people fall off the edge.

503
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:17,250
Rym: Nope, so Lena and all them are like let's fucking go out there in a boat and see what's out there.

504
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:18,394
Scott: Oh, it's water outside.

505
00:29:18,414 --> 00:29:19,517
Rym: Yeah, and you know what's out there?

506
00:29:19,979 --> 00:29:20,500
Scott: more land.

507
00:29:20,701 --> 00:29:23,510
Rym: Nobody knows magic and everyone's wet mad week.

508
00:29:24,092 --> 00:29:27,524
Rym: Okay, so they're like super powerful and there's dragon plots and stuff.

509
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:28,970
Scott: No, but the dragons out there.

510
00:29:29,171 --> 00:29:31,481
Rym: Well, there are two dragons who are just in the party.

511
00:29:32,024 --> 00:29:32,546
Scott: Oh, okay.

512
00:29:32,908 --> 00:29:34,797
Rym: Yeah, I Do.

513
00:29:34,817 --> 00:29:46,824
Rym: I do also like how God she's kind of just like Toru is just kind of like big and fat and like weird Dragon derp with her magic powers the business almost gooster.

514
00:29:47,245 --> 00:29:48,349
Rym: Oh, no, I'm talking about mr.

515
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:48,510
Rym: Coby.

516
00:29:48,591 --> 00:29:50,144
Rym: I went back to Kobayashi's dragon maid.

517
00:29:50,446 --> 00:29:53,743
Scott: Oh, that's Layers that show can use some summer goose.

518
00:29:53,763 --> 00:29:58,106
Rym: They're also kind of Derpy and bubbling bulbous in some sense.

519
00:29:58,408 --> 00:30:00,558
Rym: All right No, we will do that's lovely.

520
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:01,281
Rym: the next big show.

521
00:30:01,302 --> 00:30:02,487
Rym: watch watch us let's try.

522
00:30:02,507 --> 00:30:04,616
Rym: Mm-hmm We'll do a review of it at some point.

523
00:30:04,877 --> 00:30:12,873
Rym: Mm-hmm, but I guess think that what makes this show Tolerable is that the joke isn't just oh my god She's a dragon.

524
00:30:13,255 --> 00:30:16,170
Rym: it gets a little like it keeps changing up a little bit.

525
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:21,731
Rym: it usually seems to center around like like remember when they go to the park to play and It turned.

526
00:30:21,811 --> 00:30:28,617
Rym: basically they're shocked that she doesn't have any powers and they really really overestimate humans at every step of the way Mm-hmm.

527
00:30:30,551 --> 00:30:35,769
Rym: Yeah, it's a cute light-hearted show about dragon girls and some other character.

528
00:30:35,789 --> 00:30:36,391
Rym: Let's see There's.

529
00:30:36,552 --> 00:30:38,499
Scott: it's not an anime to run screaming from.

530
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:45,650
Scott: it's an anime to watch if you like this sort of thing Or if you've already watched all the other animes and you want to watch another anime.

531
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:51,210
Rym: It's like a light-hearted thing to watch while you're eating dinner, but it's not something you're gonna shotgun through like Gundam seed.

532
00:30:51,551 --> 00:30:52,113
Scott: Yeah, I know.

533
00:30:52,213 --> 00:30:53,899
Scott: I don't need to watch more than the five episodes.

534
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:54,722
Scott: I already watched like.

535
00:30:54,742 --> 00:30:55,966
Rym: here's a picture of tours father.

536
00:30:55,986 --> 00:31:03,843
Rym: Oh Yeah, goblin a bunch of monsters Catch the kawaddle.

537
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:07,381
Rym: Yeah, I Don't know if exactly where the show goes.

538
00:31:07,462 --> 00:31:10,677
Rym: I just know that according to the manga I don't care other than the higher plot.

539
00:31:10,817 --> 00:31:12,102
Scott: Just tell me what the actual plot is.

540
00:31:12,122 --> 00:31:12,885
Scott: I don't need to watch this.

541
00:31:13,446 --> 00:31:16,408
Rym: something about chaos Dragons as far as I can tell.

542
00:31:17,152 --> 00:31:17,835
Scott: Why is it too?

543
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:19,200
Scott: It should be way simpler than that.

544
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,207
Rym: I think there's two dragon factions.

545
00:31:21,709 --> 00:31:21,930
Scott: Okay?

546
00:31:22,951 --> 00:31:23,453
Rym: That's all I know.

547
00:31:23,473 --> 00:31:24,757
Rym: there are two dragon factions.

548
00:31:24,817 --> 00:31:27,105
Scott: all the dragons we've met so far are in the same faction.

549
00:31:27,246 --> 00:31:27,507
Rym: Oh, no.

550
00:31:27,547 --> 00:31:33,885
Rym: No, so Elma belongs to the order faction the rival to toru's chaos faction.

551
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:41,345
Rym: Elma's the kid one, uh Snow kana is the kid one.

552
00:31:41,365 --> 00:31:44,715
Rym: Okay You've already lost all the hair.

553
00:31:45,096 --> 00:31:45,538
Scott: I don't care.

554
00:31:46,723 --> 00:31:47,064
