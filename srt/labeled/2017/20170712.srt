1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,324
Rym: It's Wednesday July 12th 2017.

2
00:00:12,324 --> 00:00:14,918
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:14,958 --> 00:00:18,675
Rym: tonight We're back and we're talking about one of the most delightful anime.

4
00:00:18,695 --> 00:00:23,637
Rym: We've seen in a while eccentric family season 1 too many words.

5
00:00:23,697 --> 00:00:27,577
Scott: you could have just said Let's do this.

6
00:00:28,443 --> 00:00:32,278
Rym: It could be complicated though cuz season 2 is on like right now, and I'm actually halfway through it.

7
00:00:33,543 --> 00:00:46,289
Rym: It's real good and actually I was talking to Yuko and Judith both at Connecticut about season 2. they both said it is way more serious and probably better than season 1 and I'm really curious to see all that now.

8
00:00:46,812 --> 00:00:48,099
Rym: I really like season 1 a lot.

9
00:00:48,361 --> 00:00:51,219
Scott: Don't you save your talk about the main bit for the main bit all right?

10
00:00:51,481 --> 00:00:54,800
Rym: So you got any news about anime or animation comics?

11
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,111
Scott: You're not even gonna talk about the Connecticut that we just went to.

12
00:00:58,191 --> 00:00:58,734
Rym: that was gonna be.

13
00:00:58,774 --> 00:01:01,162
Rym: I was gonna make that my news Good.

14
00:01:01,182 --> 00:01:02,768
Scott: the new news is ways the opening bit.

15
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:03,290
Scott: Yeah.

16
00:01:03,732 --> 00:01:12,240
Rym: Oh, yeah opening bit, so I just biked home from work And it's like 88 degrees, and I'm sweaty cuz it's super hot out, and I biked real fast.

17
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,167
Scott: I think it's kind of a little bit cold out right now.

18
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:17,520
Rym: It actually got a lot chillier while I was biking home.

19
00:01:17,721 --> 00:01:18,344
Scott: It could be warmer.

20
00:01:18,364 --> 00:01:19,631
Rym: Yeah over lunch.

21
00:01:19,671 --> 00:01:21,078
Rym: It was like way hotter, and then it cooled off.

22
00:01:22,461 --> 00:01:27,787
Rym: But yeah, we were at ConnectiCon and I was in London like the week before that and I was in Hong Kong not too long before that.

23
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:35,300
Rym: so we've had a lot of Weeks where we didn't do shows and it's real hard to do a show the day after we come back from a convention.

24
00:01:35,802 --> 00:01:37,026
Rym: That's why Monday didn't happen.

25
00:01:37,508 --> 00:01:39,153
Rym: cuz I asked I also.

26
00:01:39,214 --> 00:01:40,498
Scott: I came home on my.

27
00:01:40,538 --> 00:01:48,399
Scott: you know I basically went to work straight from Connecticut Monday morning, so I was like I need to go home I can't spend another hour not at home and frankly I gotta go take care of my shit.

28
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:51,132
Rym: well I could have said something like oh that means we won't do a show.

29
00:01:51,413 --> 00:01:53,603
Rym: what I thought in my brain was yes Fuck the show.

30
00:01:53,623 --> 00:01:55,931
Scott: I have no idea for a Monday show anyway.

31
00:01:55,951 --> 00:02:03,854
Rym: I do actually I want to do a show on AV tech in like panel rooms and halls and things like that.

32
00:02:03,894 --> 00:02:04,416
Scott: we done that.

33
00:02:04,616 --> 00:02:06,622
Rym: I don't think I did a Tentative search.

34
00:02:06,663 --> 00:02:09,490
Scott: video output goes to the video display thing.

35
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,995
Scott: make sure the input is selected.

36
00:02:11,135 --> 00:02:12,920
Scott: audio output goes to the sound system.

37
00:02:13,582 --> 00:02:15,407
Rym: Go there's a few more components.

38
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:17,352
Scott: You got some microphones mix them nicely.

39
00:02:17,613 --> 00:02:17,914
Scott: There's.

40
00:02:17,954 --> 00:02:19,979
Rym: there are a few more components to that.

41
00:02:20,902 --> 00:02:26,880
Rym: Anyway, also I saw I noticed some things people are having problems with and actually they have the right adapter.

42
00:02:27,463 --> 00:02:30,199
Scott: Also, we told everyone VGA, but all the rooms at HDMI.

43
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:34,118
Rym: now They also had VGA, but people kept like kicking it under the table, okay?

44
00:02:35,003 --> 00:02:42,162
Rym: Well a lot of the rooms HDMI cables just stopped working and it looked like it's because they were just literally too long Mmm.

45
00:02:42,444 --> 00:02:43,950
Rym: They're all all those kinds of issues.

46
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,420
Scott: I thought it was because people had adapters that like weren't any good.

47
00:02:47,861 --> 00:02:49,092
Rym: Yeah, it wasn't just the adapters.

48
00:02:49,112 --> 00:02:51,240
Rym: There's more to it than that anyway.

49
00:02:52,641 --> 00:02:57,518
Scott: So his is anime news ready crunchyroll the place where I watch 90% of the anime that I watch.

50
00:02:57,558 --> 00:03:08,854
Scott: that's new And one of the only I guess the video streaming service that I cancel the least because I've said this before But just in case anyone doesn't know my strategy is because you get Netflix.

51
00:03:08,894 --> 00:03:10,180
Scott: you got who you got crunchyroll.

52
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,849
Scott: you get all these freaking shows out things out there and You know if you pay for any like.

53
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:19,220
Scott: if you pay for Netflix monthly, it's like, okay This could be months where that's worth your money is me months.

54
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,585
Scott: You don't watch Netflix at all.

55
00:03:20,646 --> 00:03:22,493
Scott: And what the hell did you just spend money on right?

56
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,200
Scott: I feel the same way about Adobe.

57
00:03:25,261 --> 00:03:31,520
Scott: There's like months where I'll make three videos and months or I won't even edit a photo and it's just like I paid 50 bucks for nothing that month anyway.

58
00:03:32,544 --> 00:03:34,060
Scott: But you can't you have to do that yearly.

59
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:39,076
Scott: You can't do it month to month with the Adobe thing easily, which is fine Cuz I'm using it literally all the times.

60
00:03:39,117 --> 00:03:39,480
Rym: I don't care.

61
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:47,799
Scott: It just feels comforting to know that at any time I have the full power to edit any Sort of digital content.

62
00:03:48,026 --> 00:04:00,479
Rym: Yep and that comes in handy when I want to make a sudden meme out of nowhere and I need to like bust open any kind of Digital content video audio image website anything I have full power at a whim so that's worth paying for.

63
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:00,880
Scott: but anyway.

64
00:04:01,201 --> 00:04:02,646
Scott: But video streaming services.

65
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:11,779
Scott: if you pay for crunchyroll some month and you don't watch a single goddamn anime episode You just threw money in the fire like right but crunchyroll I use more than you know.

66
00:04:11,921 --> 00:04:12,665
Scott: Cancel Netflix.

67
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:15,440
Scott: when I got no Netflix shows I cancel Hulu and I got no Hulu shows.

68
00:04:15,803 --> 00:04:21,595
Scott: I pretty much only subscribe to Hulu during South Park season but crunchyroll almost always on.

69
00:04:21,696 --> 00:04:40,328
Scott: so Crunchyroll is going down the path of the Netflix's and the Hulu's and the Amazon Prime's and that they realized hey You know just showing shows that someone else makes is pretty good, but to really get people to subscribe and pay We gotta make content that only we have.

70
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,900
Scott: if we stream something that someone else has it's like all right.

71
00:04:44,342 --> 00:04:50,299
Scott: You know if we stream something that's like a temporary exclusive lice It's like people can wait it out and watch it somewhere else.

72
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:58,247
Scott: But the reason all these people are making their own content is because that way it's like if we make something good You gotta pay us to see it.

73
00:04:58,348 --> 00:05:00,456
Scott: Otherwise the end is nowhere else.

74
00:05:00,476 --> 00:05:08,399
Rym: you will ever see it ever Yep, and also as soon as you own it You can do the kinds of things that a lot of licensers will not let you do sell merch.

75
00:05:09,123 --> 00:05:11,719
Rym: Look at look at Netflix with their offline mode.

76
00:05:12,342 --> 00:05:18,187
Rym: You'll notice that most stuff does not work in offline mode and the things that do work are the things that Netflix paid for themselves Right.

77
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:23,539
Scott: So anyway Crunchyroll has partnered because obviously crunchyroll doesn't have anyone who can animate on their staff right there.

78
00:05:23,921 --> 00:05:28,664
Scott: But they partnered with NBC Universal Entertainment Japan Which I didn't even know existed.

79
00:05:29,225 --> 00:05:30,228
Scott: who is previously?

80
00:05:30,248 --> 00:05:37,950
Scott: they have previously produced animes such as fruit of Grisaia Starm you - I guess they didn't make starm you one.

81
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:38,412
Scott: I don't know.

82
00:05:38,673 --> 00:05:39,576
Scott: I know starm you is.

83
00:05:39,636 --> 00:05:40,439
Scott: it's a Pokemon, right?

84
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,979
Scott: Drifters, is that related to Tokyo drifters or is it different?

85
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,007
Scott: Berserk that's an anime.

86
00:05:46,087 --> 00:05:48,480
Scott: I know that's a real anime the first real anime.

87
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,354
Scott: Yeah, as seven mortal sins don't know what the hell that is, but I guess they can produce anime.

88
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:54,899
Scott: They produce berserk, right?

89
00:05:54,999 --> 00:06:01,740
Scott: Okay So crunchyroll is partnering with them and they're going to produce anime that are yet unnamed.

90
00:06:02,163 --> 00:06:08,191
Scott: But we'll have international appeal, of course And then they're gonna put them on crunchyroll only and we're gonna watch them.

91
00:06:08,533 --> 00:06:10,580
Rym: it'll be interesting because this is kind of a big deal.

92
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:18,415
Rym: but a big part of why Netflix is able to have so much success with this is their unlimited bucket of money.

93
00:06:18,435 --> 00:06:22,590
Scott: Mm-hmm and NBC Universal Japan, I'm sure has money.

94
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:29,500
Scott: also anime that you make in Japan and pay With slave animation labor is inexpensive.

95
00:06:30,324 --> 00:06:47,216
Rym: That is actually probably the biggest factor that if you just take the existing Like studio system in Japan and just pump money into it and Commission anime I feel like it'll be real cheap to make a lot of content But at the same time that does not actually help the people in Japan.

96
00:06:47,236 --> 00:06:49,900
Scott: Mm-hmm I hope that you know.

97
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:57,651
Scott: the one thing I hope that comes from this actually is that they make some Original anime and not anime based on manga or sequels to exist it, right?

98
00:06:58,012 --> 00:06:58,233
Scott: Yeah.

99
00:06:58,273 --> 00:07:01,100
Rym: Well, I think there's a real bigger issue here.

100
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:07,920
Rym: Well not an issue but the idea of what is anime versus what is just animation is gonna get increasingly blurred.

101
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:12,060
Scott: I mean people are arguing about this Castlevania show on Netflix, which I watched.

102
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,953
Rym: I don't think anyone from Japan was super involved in like.

103
00:07:15,013 --> 00:07:16,741
Scott: no, it's not Japanese at all It's.

104
00:07:16,841 --> 00:07:16,962
Scott: it's.

105
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:19,293
Scott: it's in English is the primary language.

106
00:07:19,574 --> 00:07:20,197
Scott: That's right.

107
00:07:20,257 --> 00:07:21,764
Scott: It's not dubbed It's it.

108
00:07:21,825 --> 00:07:29,860
Scott: I mean it's dubbed in the way that dubbing means toss, you know voiceover But ADR style the original language of voice acting is English, right?

109
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:36,055
Scott: It is made by an American studio and mostly and no not Japanese really right it.

110
00:07:36,095 --> 00:07:44,220
Scott: but it you know has a Visual style that is not often seen in things that are produced.

111
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:50,620
Scott: You know, obviously anime comes in many different styles and you know animation comes in many different styles regardless of nation of origin.

112
00:07:51,185 --> 00:08:04,809
Scott: but the style of this is more like a lot of you know, generic not interesting anime styles and is not very much looking like you know a American, you know style animation.

113
00:08:04,829 --> 00:08:07,679
Rym: Well, I think what it'll be is that there was you know, the anime.

114
00:08:08,781 --> 00:08:27,620
Rym: Even though like we said there isn't really a particular style the kinds of shows and the things that came out of anime are going to start increasingly being adopted by just animation globally and the idea that something is anime because it came from Japan will be a lot like a Particular film movement like via our films from a certain era.

115
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,463
Scott: Yeah well Todd we'll talk more about the Castlevania show.

116
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,510
Scott: one's room watches it cuz only four episodes.

117
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:33,754
Scott: it's like 20 minutes each.

118
00:08:33,895 --> 00:08:35,320
Rym: the next the only thing big nights.

119
00:08:35,422 --> 00:08:36,299
Rym: We will review it.

120
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:44,011
Scott: But the only thing I want to say about it now is that when I was watching it It's like it was really the one thing that was really disappointing.

121
00:08:44,053 --> 00:08:48,424
Scott: the most disappointing about it was that it felt like It should have been.

122
00:08:49,026 --> 00:08:58,268
Scott: it was like leaning towards a Yoshitaka Amano style, but was so far away from it And obviously had no involvement with it whatsoever.

123
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:02,539
Scott: that like I just really wanted like they just should have had him do it.

124
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:07,034
Rym: Yeah, I really just want an animated feature a new one.

125
00:09:07,115 --> 00:09:08,339
Rym: That is just his crap.

126
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:15,660
Scott: Yep It's like they would have just hired Amano to do the arts on that show would have been like like the greatest thing ever.

127
00:09:15,782 --> 00:09:24,420
Rym: Anyway, so yeah the Castlevania thing is kind of a missed opportunity and I'm not gonna talk about it too much because like I said We're gonna literally review it on the next Wednesday show of GeekNights.

128
00:09:24,901 --> 00:09:28,794
Rym: So this past weekend as you know, we were ConnectiCon which is not an anime convention.

129
00:09:28,855 --> 00:09:30,480
Rym: It is just a convention.

130
00:09:30,641 --> 00:09:41,918
Scott: It's a nerdy convention of all nerdy things comics tabletop games video games You know an amaze everything nerdy is there and there's very little like it out there.

131
00:09:42,078 --> 00:09:44,886
Scott: cuz most There's a lot of everything cons.

132
00:09:44,906 --> 00:09:48,120
Scott: They just a lot of them don't have the balls to call themselves everything con.

133
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:57,774
Scott: Well, a lot of everything cons to are super tiny and a lot of it ain't that small and and they are not run as Well, it might be one of the better run everything cons that we know of.

134
00:09:58,075 --> 00:09:59,541
Rym: Yep, but we were there, you know We're.

135
00:09:59,862 --> 00:10:14,387
Rym: if you don't know we literally like run the entire panels department there And as always because we scheduled a whole bunch of panels and like random and had like the counts and everything I noticed a lot of interesting trends about Like what is popular and not now.

136
00:10:14,427 --> 00:10:22,280
Rym: and one thing I can say pretty definitively based on three years of trend data The pony fandom has all but vanished from the convention.

137
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,888
Scott: No, I mean I saw plenty of pony action.

138
00:10:24,968 --> 00:10:29,160
Rym: keep pony action in that people will wear merchandise about my little pony.

139
00:10:29,401 --> 00:10:31,229
Rym: There'll be tons of art in the artist alley.

140
00:10:31,249 --> 00:10:35,926
Rym: Mm-hmm, but there is almost no interest in attending Pony related panels.

141
00:10:36,207 --> 00:10:39,480
Rym: No, and there's almost no one submitting pony related panels.

142
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,930
Rym: No, meanwhile, you know, it came back in a big way.

143
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:44,983
Rym: I got a shit ton of Hetalia.

144
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:45,807
Rym: ask a nation.

145
00:10:45,847 --> 00:10:48,480
Rym: submissions really gone for years.

146
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:55,140
Scott: I only saw one Hetalia with my eyeballs, but I saw actually a big two scoops full of homestucks.

147
00:10:55,743 --> 00:10:56,608
Scott: Oh, yeah, there were.

148
00:10:56,669 --> 00:11:01,570
Scott: it wasn't like the homestucks back in the heyday But there were like two nice scoops worth of homestucks that I saw.

149
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:05,971
Rym: but in terms of submissions like Hetalia submissions We're up in a big way.

150
00:11:06,011 --> 00:11:06,716
Rym: I think we're way down.

151
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,088
Scott: I think the reason for that is.

152
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:12,000
Scott: I don't think it has anything to do with the popularity of Hetalia itself.

153
00:11:12,121 --> 00:11:16,460
Scott: I think is that the Hetalia community is a community that knows how to submit panels.

154
00:11:16,741 --> 00:11:20,800
Scott: I think that is more so than other pet communities regardless of size.

155
00:11:21,941 --> 00:11:24,710
Rym: I think cosplay related panels.

156
00:11:25,071 --> 00:11:27,940
Rym: I got more submissions for that than literally anything.

157
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,399
Scott: That's the biggest thing at the gun.

158
00:11:29,621 --> 00:11:31,848
Rym: But most of them still are.

159
00:11:31,868 --> 00:11:35,800
Rym: I am a cosplayer and and they don't really have anything going on in the panel.

160
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:39,737
Rym: so the ones I scheduled were ones like I am a pro and here's a technique.

161
00:11:40,219 --> 00:11:47,480
Rym: or Here is some like real information on plus-size cosplay and like how to do it right and stuff like that like real technical panels.

162
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:53,418
Rym: I'm not interested in how I make dozens of dollars with my youtube channel about cosplay photography.

163
00:11:53,438 --> 00:12:08,858
Rym: Nope But yeah, we ran our channels and what was really interesting is that ConnectiCon is one of those cons like Zenkai Con or like all the cons that are in a place Where the people who live in that place don't tend to travel to other conventions.

164
00:12:08,898 --> 00:12:16,304
Rym: that much Nope, so you'd have people for whom that convention is their first and or only Convention.

165
00:12:16,545 --> 00:12:23,600
Rym: Mm-hmm meaning we being lazy take all the content We've run it like five packs is and just recycle it at like Zenkai Con and ConnectiCon.

166
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:34,849
Rym: but when I ran for an anime openers, which is something I've run like years and years this everywhere I ran I pretty much filled the room and I think 90% of the people in the room.

167
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:43,184
Rym: never heard of me never been to a ConnectiCon before But didn't have any idea about any of this stuff and I'll for a lot of them I'd say half the room.

168
00:12:43,204 --> 00:12:45,255
Rym: It was their first convention ever.

169
00:12:45,517 --> 00:12:45,798
Scott: Mm-hmm.

170
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,880
Rym: So all I want to say is that that German Naruto shtick?

171
00:12:50,382 --> 00:12:51,889
Rym: I had to pause and rewind.

172
00:12:51,929 --> 00:12:52,914
Rym: people were laughing so hard.

173
00:12:52,934 --> 00:12:54,059
Rym: They could not believe it.

174
00:12:54,922 --> 00:12:57,009
Scott: Seen a German Naruto before they'd never.

175
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:00,700
Rym: the the foreign anime openers concept was already pretty crazy.

176
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,400
Rym: The Italian pony thing kind of kind of lost him.

177
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:03,822
Rym: They were.

178
00:13:03,842 --> 00:13:06,999
Rym: I had to back up and replay parts of that because they were making so much noise.

179
00:13:08,342 --> 00:13:23,188
Rym: but uh, yeah, uh The other trends I see is that there are fewer and fewer anime related panels being submitted and more importantly Almost all the anime panels are people who have submitted them in the past And or who I see it.

180
00:13:23,228 --> 00:13:31,760
Rym: other kinds like anime Boston or like Charles Dunbar and No one seems to have any interest in talking about most recent anime.

181
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,995
Rym: It's all panels about old anime submitted by people who are around our age.

182
00:13:36,055 --> 00:13:39,440
Scott: Maybe I'll do a eccentric family panel, huh?

183
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:41,081
Rym: Like.

184
00:13:41,242 --> 00:13:44,214
Rym: I think I only have like 35 minutes of content though.

185
00:13:44,354 --> 00:13:45,760
Scott: Well now if we get a second season in there.

186
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:48,526
Rym: Oh, yeah Seasons do some research about.

187
00:13:48,887 --> 00:13:52,577
Rym: so here's how hell is portrayed in this painting and how that relates to.

188
00:13:52,838 --> 00:13:53,580
Rym: I could be a fun panel.

189
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,444
Rym: Actually, hmm.

190
00:13:54,906 --> 00:13:58,220
Rym: I'm suddenly feeling a be like maybe we should make a new set of anime panels.

191
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,668
Rym: Is that a recycling over and over again?

192
00:13:59,728 --> 00:14:01,136
Scott: I could do your pet old panel.

193
00:14:01,156 --> 00:14:03,519
Scott: Yeah I could do a big you off at open.

194
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,466
Rym: The problem is the anime have the most to say about her.

195
00:14:05,486 --> 00:14:06,610
Rym: still the old ass anime.

196
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,152
Rym: There's almost.

197
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:08,477
Scott: I'll mostly talk about biking.

198
00:14:08,818 --> 00:14:17,249
Rym: Yeah But anyway things of the day.

199
00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:19,497
Rym: so remember that channel that we're a fan of.

200
00:14:19,537 --> 00:14:20,220
Rym: it's the woman who?

201
00:14:20,964 --> 00:14:29,074
Rym: makes Helper robots that are just awful Like they'll chop lettuce really dangerously with knives flying.

202
00:14:29,154 --> 00:14:30,880
Scott: Oh, I saw one just the other day.

203
00:14:31,002 --> 00:14:32,703
Scott: I don't know if it was this channel But it probably is.

204
00:14:32,743 --> 00:14:36,580
Scott: it was chopping a bread from the a loaf of bread from the top really poorly not.

205
00:14:37,021 --> 00:14:44,320
Rym: So this I just found this kids YouTube channel like ran it randomly and this clearly looks like a dorm room in a college campus.

206
00:14:44,809 --> 00:15:01,748
Rym: And basically he did a project where he used facial recognition technology to make a tiny robot and what that robot will do is Track any human face it sees and try to shine the laser pen in their eye And the video is pretty good because he tied.

207
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:05,858
Rym: he talks a lot about like why he made it and how it seems like it's Gonna be a really good thing.

208
00:15:06,682 --> 00:15:17,420
Rym: but then he's you know, it's obviously like a school project and showing off the code and then he goes to demonstrate it and Literally he turns it on and he starts to talk and it gets him right in the eye and he's like, ah shit.

209
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:29,019
Rym: And then he does the rest of the video trying to like Avoid it hitting him in the eye while he talks about how it works and it's way funnier than it has any right to be.

210
00:15:30,084 --> 00:15:30,990
Rym: Up there got him again.

211
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:32,359
Scott: Just close your eyes, bro.

212
00:15:33,261 --> 00:15:37,395
Rym: Yeah, if you get hit in the eye with a regular laser pen and you close your eye, you can still see it.

213
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:51,117
Rym: Mm-hmm And the related videos to this seem to mostly be people making dangerous weapons with laser pens or Diodes, but this video is actually really funny and I laughed out loud.

214
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:53,763
Rym: So So what do you got?

215
00:15:54,185 --> 00:16:02,710
Scott: Oh, so this is a illustrator based out of Tokyo that I follow on Twitter Because their arts are way awesome and they're called utomaru.

216
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:06,100
Scott: I think they that Twitter account itself was the thing of the day way back.

217
00:16:07,461 --> 00:16:23,580
Scott: But anyway utomaru has been doing the album art for this idol person named Oresama for I think like a couple albums, right and Oresama, I guess it's just some generic J-pop idol person or whatever, right?

218
00:16:25,722 --> 00:16:29,803
Scott: Anyway, so Oresama now has like a Is.

219
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:38,172
Scott: I got a major label now and they just had a new music video that came out just now And it's generic J-pop.

220
00:16:38,192 --> 00:16:39,320
Scott: It sounds like an anime opener.

221
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,407
Rym: Yeah My brain is literally.

222
00:16:41,487 --> 00:16:45,142
Rym: I'm listening to it with Scott before the show and I'm like, oh this sounds exactly Like.

223
00:16:45,483 --> 00:16:51,362
Rym: and my brain is every anime opener ever not all of them all the ones from a certain era Sure Cuz you know.

224
00:16:51,382 --> 00:16:57,847
Rym: like the late 90s anime openers have a particular sound to them as opposed to like the mid 2000s anime.

225
00:16:58,069 --> 00:16:59,680
Scott: anyway, we don't we don't care about this song.

226
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:05,740
Scott: What we care about is that utomaru's amazing illustrations are all over this music video.

227
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,288
Scott: So just like watch the music video.

228
00:17:07,308 --> 00:17:08,050
Rym: Yeah, you've retweeted.

229
00:17:08,092 --> 00:17:09,760
Rym: I've seen you've retweeted this cat hour before.

230
00:17:09,886 --> 00:17:18,310
Scott: Yeah Just watch the video and you can mute it if you want and just you can see like so much Illustrations were done and put all over this music video.

231
00:17:18,411 --> 00:17:20,538
Scott: I guess the song is called that bat back there.

232
00:17:20,698 --> 00:17:21,200
Rym: It's a good bat.

233
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:25,104
Scott: yeah, it looks like a drakey from Dragon Quest.

234
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:28,961
Scott: yeah does but yeah, the song is called trip trip trip Whatever.

235
00:17:28,982 --> 00:17:34,880
Scott: and it has like this RPG theme kind of going on while also has like a vacation traveling theme combined.

236
00:17:35,944 --> 00:17:36,660
Rym: That could be a good manga.

237
00:17:36,927 --> 00:17:43,460
Rym: It's visually Stimulating like that's how manga you're reading at the beach that I gotta borrow and read about the people in the dungeon delicious and dungeon.

238
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:44,640
Scott: Yeah, it's alright.

239
00:17:45,521 --> 00:17:51,960
Rym: So in the moment the book of book is Frank Herbert's do not and we both read it and I got a lot to say.

240
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,200
Rym: So the next Thursday episode of GeekNights will be a week from tomorrow.

241
00:17:55,221 --> 00:17:57,127
Scott: Yes We're gonna talk from today.

242
00:17:57,167 --> 00:18:07,391
Rym: for most of you the GeekNights book club is gonna talk about Dune which I had never read all the way through in my life until recently and To give you a preview of what we're gonna say about that book.

243
00:18:08,235 --> 00:18:14,475
Rym: It is way Simpler and more straightforward than the internet and people I have talked to over the years.

244
00:18:14,495 --> 00:18:16,759
Rym: that led me to believe I'm gonna even know the spoiler.

245
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:23,200
Scott: Nowhere in the book do the words quote the spice must flow appear.

246
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,708
Rym: Yeah, was that in the movie?

247
00:18:26,029 --> 00:18:27,354
Scott: It might be in the movie.

248
00:18:27,374 --> 00:18:30,760
Scott: I'm gonna have to go watch the movie I think so I could add it into the conversation.

249
00:18:30,921 --> 00:18:36,540
Scott: Well, I went and read even though I've heard bad things about the movie and I believe them but I gotta watch it anyway.

250
00:18:36,902 --> 00:18:37,665
Rym: Yeah, I could watch it.

251
00:18:37,705 --> 00:18:37,886
Rym: Now.

252
00:18:38,107 --> 00:18:40,940
Rym: What I really want to do is play the Dune board game again.

253
00:18:41,181 --> 00:18:42,405
Scott: I have played the food dude.

254
00:18:42,465 --> 00:18:45,015
Rym: I have played it, but I have not played it since I read Dune.

255
00:18:45,075 --> 00:18:45,316
Scott: Sure.

256
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:55,276
Rym: Ah Never before has an intellectual property been applied to a game So literally and yet still been an actually good game.

257
00:18:55,497 --> 00:18:56,099
Rym: Mm-hmm like.

258
00:18:57,041 --> 00:19:04,169
Rym: It's kind of amazing and I'm actually like legit shocked by that and I feel like we could do a whole episode on that Concept on a Tuesday.

259
00:19:04,189 --> 00:19:05,578
Rym: Mm-hmm, cuz it's nuts.

260
00:19:05,598 --> 00:19:15,260
Rym: Mm-hmm I feel like you could do the same thing with Game of Thrones But I don't know if anyone will because the Game of Thrones game is not that I played it.

261
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,102
Rym: Of course.

262
00:19:16,142 --> 00:19:17,674
Rym: wasn't there a second edition that we didn't play?

263
00:19:17,694 --> 00:19:18,500
Rym: that fixed some issues?

264
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,332
Rym: I don't remember.

265
00:19:19,434 --> 00:19:22,853
Rym: Hmm That was in our recess back when we used to go to those in the meta moment.

266
00:19:23,275 --> 00:19:24,379
Rym: other than the book club.

267
00:19:25,343 --> 00:19:27,840
Rym: We gonna pick the next book club book which we'll do at some point.

268
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:32,705
Rym: I think Scott said he has an idea so I'm able to go with that If you do have an idea.

269
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:39,575
Rym: if you listen to this because you her found us at Connecticut And you're somehow still listening all the way to this point.

270
00:19:39,876 --> 00:19:41,919
Scott: Whoa One what's wrong with you?

271
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:47,800
Rym: I'm amazed that you figured out we do a podcast because a lot of our fans like seem to not realize that.

272
00:19:48,802 --> 00:19:51,660
Rym: Like we have fans on YouTube who don't know about the podcast and vice-versa.

273
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,685
Scott: Even though you're now putting the podcast on YouTube It doesn't help.

274
00:19:54,906 --> 00:19:56,379
Rym: that is starting to help a lot.

275
00:19:56,781 --> 00:19:57,463
Rym: I see my seal.

276
00:19:57,524 --> 00:20:00,395
Rym: I've actually seen an uptick because I've been watching the Libsyn cuz.

277
00:20:00,415 --> 00:20:02,423
Rym: I'm trying to like now that I'm paying For it directly.

278
00:20:02,443 --> 00:20:06,219
Rym: I'm trying to tune what we pay for and tune my bit rates and all that stuff.

279
00:20:06,682 --> 00:20:09,939
Rym: But anyway, I've seen an uptick and I think they're starting to help in that way.

280
00:20:10,522 --> 00:20:11,906
Rym: I've also noticed something interesting.

281
00:20:12,468 --> 00:20:14,313
Rym: the Thursday shows get the most live streams.

282
00:20:14,353 --> 00:20:16,360
Rym: the Wednesday shows get the least live streams.

283
00:20:16,681 --> 00:20:18,489
Scott: Maybe this is because the day it might be.

284
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:27,378
Rym: I don't know if it's the content of the day or what but If you found us at Connecticut and you wanna and you like want to know more about any of the panels.

285
00:20:27,398 --> 00:20:37,434
Rym: we did Little little fun fact to three of the panels that for four of the panels We did a Connecticut are already on YouTube from other conventions.

286
00:20:37,534 --> 00:20:43,555
Rym: And if you watch them on YouTube They're just better more polished versions of what we have as Lee did a Connecticut.

287
00:20:43,796 --> 00:20:49,750
Rym: So that's the secret And otherwise like you should follow all our stuff on the internet.

288
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:55,830
Rym: Scott's YouTube channel has a lot of live streams like you were live streaming Like us running the panel's department at Connecticut.

289
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:57,014
Rym: No, they're pretty interesting videos.

290
00:20:57,536 --> 00:20:58,499
Scott: I watched the one I was using.

291
00:20:59,022 --> 00:21:02,377
Rym: I watched the one with you and Kate and I watched the one of you walking around.

292
00:21:02,417 --> 00:21:03,020
Rym: they were entertaining.

293
00:21:03,261 --> 00:21:04,448
Rym: I was legit entertained.

294
00:21:04,689 --> 00:21:06,540
Rym: All right, I feel like we should do that more.

295
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,760
Rym: I think we should live stream a random crap from conventions.

296
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:14,860
Rym: We go to way more often because it totally works and like it's moderately entertaining.

297
00:21:15,126 --> 00:21:17,652
Rym: uh What else do we got?

298
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:18,360
Rym: nothing really?

299
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:24,900
Rym: I guess the only important thing is because a lot of you are emailing me about this or posting random comments.

300
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,629
Rym: I'm like random videos on my channel about this.

301
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:30,899
Rym: So one now the Connecticut and all that travel is done.

302
00:21:31,742 --> 00:21:33,949
Rym: We're resuming all the projects that were on hold.

303
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:36,436
Rym: So the convention we're trying to start.

304
00:21:36,677 --> 00:21:37,580
Rym: we're working on that now.

305
00:21:37,961 --> 00:21:39,869
Rym: The utenna GeekNights presents show.

306
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:42,420
Rym: we're gonna put an episode up real soon.

307
00:21:42,481 --> 00:21:44,479
Rym: We're gonna produce it like I got my shit together.

308
00:21:46,082 --> 00:21:48,800
Rym: All those other like the game show all that crap we were talking about.

309
00:21:49,362 --> 00:21:50,668
Rym: We have time to work on that now.

310
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:57,552
Rym: The only thing that will get in our way between now and October is that if it's really nice outside, we're not doing shit.

311
00:21:57,572 --> 00:22:01,345
Rym: Mm-hmm and also the packs.

312
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:05,906
Scott: the next convention is real packs.

313
00:22:06,007 --> 00:22:17,787
Scott: labor day weekend in Seattle I always forget until like cuz I'm always focused on my next summer when summer ends Real packs arise.

314
00:22:17,847 --> 00:22:19,714
Rym: I mean we've got to the point in our lives.

315
00:22:19,774 --> 00:22:20,697
Rym: It's kind of fascinating.

316
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:29,835
Rym: the conventions We go to no matter what now are magfest PAX West PAX East packs out PAX Australia PAX Unplugged PAX dev.

317
00:22:30,096 --> 00:22:31,219
Rym: There's there's a pattern there.

318
00:22:31,239 --> 00:22:36,578
Rym: Yeah Thank icon And we pretty much dropped almost everything else.

319
00:22:36,598 --> 00:22:39,031
Rym: we'll see Boston now that I'm inspired to do some.

320
00:22:39,051 --> 00:22:39,333
Rym: I only

321
00:22:39,393 --> 00:22:40,840
Scott: skipped anime Boston one time

322
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:51,191
Rym: Yeah and I feel actually kind of refreshed by skipping it because this year was just a busy year that we might be able to bring an A-game to the next anime Boston because we're not missing good weather if we go to that.

323
00:22:51,492 --> 00:22:58,960
Rym: Mmm, but PAX West is The packs and me and Emily are gonna be in Seattle for nine days.

324
00:22:59,982 --> 00:23:00,609
Scott: It's a lot of days.

325
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:01,115
Rym: Yeah it is.

326
00:23:02,022 --> 00:23:03,266
Scott: I'm gonna be there for less days.

327
00:23:03,286 --> 00:23:04,792
Rym: Well, cause you don't go to PAX dev.

328
00:23:04,952 --> 00:23:07,120
Scott: I'm gonna arrive Thursday and leave Tuesday.

329
00:23:07,202 --> 00:23:13,360
Rym: I'm gonna arrive I think Monday Sunday night or Monday and then we're gonna leave like the following Tuesday.

330
00:23:14,841 --> 00:23:15,927
Rym: I think I'm gonna fly Delta though.

331
00:23:15,947 --> 00:23:17,856
Rym: I think it might be done with the jet blue.

332
00:23:17,876 --> 00:23:19,840
Scott: Mmm I already got jet blue tickets.

333
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:32,685
Rym: so I want to say the majority of my flights to or from packs for the past few years have been late and I don't think I've been on a single late flight might have been and I was looking as I fly a lot and actually Jet blue.

334
00:23:33,127 --> 00:23:35,720
Rym: is this really like dropping in the on-time performance?

335
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,815
Rym: Domestically and their fleet is aging pretty badly and the Delta tickets are actually cheaper.

336
00:23:40,835 --> 00:23:43,283
Rym: So We'll see.

337
00:23:43,766 --> 00:23:48,470
Rym: thing is if I do jet blue partly I got a ton of miles So I gotta like blow them all I get for free flights.

338
00:23:48,731 --> 00:23:52,246
Scott: Yeah, I don't know how many true blue points or whatever I looked never used my points.

339
00:23:52,286 --> 00:23:55,920
Rym: I've only yeah me there so I got a shit ton of points.

340
00:23:56,302 --> 00:24:05,520
Rym: Mmm, you know we could do though if I don't use them on packs Maybe we should just use them to go down to like Puerto Rico or something and like yes Let us go to a tropical place.

341
00:24:05,741 --> 00:24:08,673
Scott: No other reason then let's go to a tropical place.

342
00:24:08,854 --> 00:24:14,580
Rym: actually cuz I'm not the whole crew can do that But maybe like you made Emily's just do that like take a long weekend and just like pop down there use up all our miles.

343
00:24:15,501 --> 00:24:15,883
Rym: Let's do it.

344
00:24:15,903 --> 00:24:18,800
Scott: I'm actually I'm feeling that that's that's my idea.

345
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:22,060
Scott: You're stealing my idea the idea that I keep saying and everyone else is me.

346
00:24:22,401 --> 00:24:26,240
Scott: Well, because not everyone every time every time it's like where do we go?

347
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:33,240
Scott: I'm like, let's go to a place where the water is blue Why not like this guy could do both and everyone's like meh and I'm like, what is wrong with you?

348
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:37,819
Scott: Let's go to a place where the water is so clear that you can see the fishies.

349
00:24:38,204 --> 00:24:42,576
Rym: Part of well The thing is that the thing about going to the Jersey Shore is that the place of the water is black.

350
00:24:42,616 --> 00:24:50,740
Rym: that place but all Our friends can go because there isn't the barriers to entry of taking a bunch of time off work and or flying and or like.

351
00:24:51,141 --> 00:24:55,660
Scott: Let's go to a place where our anime will be anime of our lives will become island episodes.

352
00:24:55,941 --> 00:24:57,791
Scott: Let us go the island episode.

353
00:24:57,811 --> 00:24:58,233
Rym: We haven't.

354
00:24:58,394 --> 00:24:59,460
Scott: let us go to that place.

355
00:24:59,601 --> 00:25:04,000
Rym: Actually, I'm uh, I'm looking for an excuse to go back to Costa Rica cuz I want to visit Emily's family down there.

356
00:25:04,481 --> 00:25:06,047
Scott: Cuz what color the water they got?

357
00:25:06,067 --> 00:25:10,797
Rym: Uh, it's it's colorless cuz you can see all the way to the bottom Even when you swim way out there.

358
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,129
Rym: Yeah, and it's super except the only.

359
00:25:14,169 --> 00:25:16,500
Rym: the only drawback is if you go to give those beaches.

360
00:25:17,002 --> 00:25:24,550
Rym: The sand was so hot that if you tried to walk across the beach without sandals You would literally burn your feet to the point of blisters.

361
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:26,398
Scott: I mean that happened even in Jersey.

362
00:25:26,539 --> 00:25:33,120
Rym: Oh, yeah I remember running and feeling really bad about myself at Sandy Hook last year in the last trip we did.

363
00:25:34,181 --> 00:25:38,240
Rym: Also, I think I got a minor sinus infection from the bacteria in the water on our last Sandy Hook.

364
00:25:38,381 --> 00:25:40,910
Rym: So yeah, maybe some clear water might be a good idea.

365
00:25:40,931 --> 00:25:41,533
Rym: I don't have a problem.

366
00:25:42,035 --> 00:25:43,240
Rym: Yeah, I swam a lot more than you.

367
00:25:43,924 --> 00:25:46,500
Rym: I also got a bunch of water at my nose cuz I kept swimming underwater.

368
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,166
Rym: But yeah, I'm just I'm feeling beaches.

369
00:25:49,186 --> 00:25:50,431
Rym: Maybe we should go to Sandy Hook this weekend.

370
00:25:51,053 --> 00:25:52,037
Rym: Mmm every weekend.

371
00:25:52,097 --> 00:25:52,680
Rym: Just keep going.

372
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,965
Scott: It's a lot of money together.

373
00:25:54,145 --> 00:26:03,084
Rym: Yeah, I'm still looking at Airbnb's - maybe we can go down to like Jersey Shore but further north and just rent a house and we don't have to deal with you know Restrictions or people.

374
00:26:03,365 --> 00:26:04,349
Scott: why don't we at least go to?

375
00:26:04,389 --> 00:26:11,314
Rym: I mean at least go to Virginia Beach, which is nice thing Yeah, but it's way easier to just rent a car and just drive down the Garden State like an hour.

376
00:26:11,334 --> 00:26:11,455
Rym: Mm-hmm.

377
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,271
Rym: So you might recall we do our judge anime by its cover.

378
00:26:16,331 --> 00:26:28,000
Rym: when we do go to anime Boston and stay tuned We might just start doing that as a YouTube show because I think it's really good And I also like doing it and it's shockingly low effort because we're not even allowed to research the shows.

379
00:26:28,441 --> 00:26:35,180
Rym: But one of the shows we reviewed based on one screenshot and a few sentences was the eccentric family.

380
00:26:36,302 --> 00:26:38,294
Rym: And now we've both seen the entire first season.

381
00:26:38,374 --> 00:26:39,340
Scott: I've seen about half of this.

382
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,580
Scott: I could have swore you I've watched this a long time ago, but I'm re-watching it now.

383
00:26:43,841 --> 00:26:48,160
Scott: I just finished re-watching the first season anyway, because season two just came out.

384
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,666
Rym: Season two is real good.

385
00:26:49,686 --> 00:26:55,520
Scott: I haven't watched even any episodes of season two because yet just yesterday I finished re-watching season ones.

386
00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:01,540
Scott: I've seen the entirety of season one two times very and once very very recently as in yesterday.

387
00:27:02,242 --> 00:27:07,240
Scott: So and I could have swore we did an episode about this show after only watching a few episodes.

388
00:27:07,682 --> 00:27:11,819
Scott: But I guess you didn't find it doesn't matter because we're an eccentric doesn't even show up in the back end.

389
00:27:11,859 --> 00:27:16,608
Scott: search Yeah, and we definitely have not done An episode on it.

390
00:27:16,849 --> 00:27:21,840
Rym: I'm pretty sure what happened is we might have completed We might have mentioned it like as we both watched a couple episodes.

391
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,372
Rym: I think we just mentioned it in like the early part of an episode.

392
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:25,558
Rym: Mm-hmm, and that's probably it.

393
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:30,060
Rym: so Sport knows we'll we'll save spoilers to the end and we'll warn you.

394
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:36,653
Rym: So don't worry because season one alone does not really deserve a like Full final thoughts cuz it's not like Trigun where there's a lot.

395
00:27:36,673 --> 00:27:41,133
Scott: There's not a lot to say even though It's got a lot of eccentricities.

396
00:27:41,153 --> 00:27:50,148
Rym: Yeah Alright, this is my favorite show of last season like hands down Sure, cuz one punch man came out before that.

397
00:27:50,228 --> 00:27:50,730
Rym: Yes, it did.

398
00:27:51,452 --> 00:27:53,920
Rym: Uh, oh do I like this more than one punch man?

399
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,222
Rym: I feel like.

400
00:27:55,242 --> 00:27:57,774
Scott: well, no, this isn't even a show of 20 of the last season.

401
00:27:57,794 --> 00:28:00,005
Scott: This is a show from years ago 2015.

402
00:28:00,005 --> 00:28:00,447
Rym: yeah, you're right.

403
00:28:00,467 --> 00:28:00,708
Scott: He's in.

404
00:28:00,909 --> 00:28:02,899
Rym: one is old season two is right now.

405
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:06,978
Rym: Yeah, I think I like this and here's neither season came out the same time.

406
00:28:06,998 --> 00:28:12,356
Rym: as one bunch I like this show and one punch man equally for very different reasons.

407
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:13,520
Scott: No, I want one more.

408
00:28:14,563 --> 00:28:15,607
Rym: I think I like them equally.

409
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:19,700
Scott: he who punches only once yeah, but bent and Sama and whatever.

410
00:28:20,901 --> 00:28:27,458
Rym: so the gist of this show is that it's set in modern-day Kyoto and It's based on a novel.

411
00:28:29,402 --> 00:28:36,236
Scott: The first novel came out 2000 something 2007 and then that first season of the anime covers the first novel.

412
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:40,560
Scott: but then Another novel a sequel novel came out much more recently.

413
00:28:41,042 --> 00:28:45,200
Scott: So then they once that novel came out they guess they went into production with another anime.

414
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:45,481
Scott: There's

415
00:28:45,501 --> 00:28:48,516
Rym: also a manga which I haven't seen even one screenshot from yeah

416
00:28:49,501 --> 00:29:01,020
Scott: Yeah, and it this seems like it's the kind of thing that was like made out of like, you know Just because and wouldn't be that popular but apparently was popular enough to like just make another anime.

417
00:29:01,181 --> 00:29:06,223
Scott: So well, I'm very happy that like people like this so much that they keep making more so.

418
00:29:06,565 --> 00:29:20,780
Rym: the gist of the story is that in modern-day Kyoto the beasts and creatures and mythology of Japan is Alive and well and it just continues to coexist alongside humans just like it did in ancient times, right?

419
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,525
Scott: So there's a huge.

420
00:29:21,565 --> 00:29:28,097
Scott: the human society is perfectly normal But there's also like Tengu's and tanukis and these sorts of.

421
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:36,218
Scott: you know Mystical things, you know and they're combined in the same place and it's sort of hard to tell right?

422
00:29:36,318 --> 00:29:37,483
Scott: is it's like on the one Hand?

423
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,259
Scott: are these things?

424
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:40,584
Scott: You know, is it like?

425
00:29:40,604 --> 00:29:43,220
Scott: do the people see these tonic ease and things?

426
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,640
Rym: They definitely do occasionally because one of the a good a nice point of the show like a plot point.

427
00:29:48,761 --> 00:29:50,318
Rym: Is that one of the tonic II?

428
00:29:50,922 --> 00:30:04,120
Rym: Him and his dad one of their favorite things to do was he would shape-shift Into a particular tram that runs into used to run in Kyoto Yep, and just careen down the street scaring the ever-living shit out of drunk people late at night, right?

429
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:16,455
Scott: So it's weird because on the one hand people can obviously See human beings can obviously see and interact with the Tengu's and the tonic ease and things like that because sometimes the tender good Tengu and tanuki are fucking dangerous to those humans.

430
00:30:16,637 --> 00:30:16,898
Scott: Sure.

431
00:30:17,641 --> 00:30:28,439
Scott: But at the same time like when humans talk it's like they don't seem to know that like tonic ease Transform and like they think tonic ease are just animals in the woods

432
00:30:28,881 --> 00:30:35,306
Rym: which makes sense because you know to a modern person else you in less than a tonic II like Middle by transformed in humans

433
00:30:35,346 --> 00:30:44,660
Scott: are having a festival and is like boats flying in the sky That are clearly Visible and they don't seem to be reacting or giving a shit.

434
00:30:44,881 --> 00:30:46,326
Rym: The show sort of sets up that like.

435
00:30:46,346 --> 00:30:52,551
Rym: there's definitely this like liminal separation between the worlds because a lot of times Characters go to a place.

436
00:30:52,632 --> 00:30:54,039
Rym: That's like a it's not.

437
00:30:54,982 --> 00:31:03,518
Rym: It's not a physical place in the same sense as like the rest of the area that they're in like they'll enter basically some sort Of like TARDIS like space all the time.

438
00:31:04,141 --> 00:31:18,320
Scott: But I just think it's really an interesting way of avoiding those sorts of questions like you know about the boundaries between the worlds By just sort of being like man, you know, we'll just we'll just do whatever is convenient scene to scene.

439
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,749
Rym: It fits more with like.

440
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:21,380
Scott: this is not sturdy pots.

441
00:31:21,661 --> 00:31:30,769
Rym: It fits more with my sensibility my understanding of like Japanese Sensibility toward mythology in that these are things that sort of exist on the edges of your perception Like you see something weird.

442
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:32,699
Rym: Maybe that was a tonic II like you don't know.

443
00:31:33,161 --> 00:31:36,971
Rym: So it sort of fits into that like the humans who interact with these things.

444
00:31:37,272 --> 00:31:43,208
Rym: It is brief transient interactions that Startle or surprise them usually right?

445
00:31:43,228 --> 00:31:46,780
Scott: So anyway, it's called eccentric family and it's about this family of tanuki.

446
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:52,238
Scott: Yeah, and they live in like a temple or whatever and they have powers to transform because they're tanuki.

447
00:31:52,258 --> 00:31:53,406
Scott: there You can do.

448
00:31:53,426 --> 00:31:57,091
Scott: they're in the little cute animal form But they also can turn into many other forms.

449
00:31:57,111 --> 00:31:59,060
Rym: The cute animal form is super cute and different.

450
00:31:59,301 --> 00:32:04,160
Scott: Yeah, different different tanukis have different amounts and varieties of transformation power, right?

451
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,672
Scott: So the oldest brother can transform into a tiger and fucking bite the hell out of you.

452
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:12,085
Rym: Yeah, but he's way high strong Little bait.

453
00:32:12,126 --> 00:32:14,714
Scott: the kid who's you know, I guess he's elementary school age.

454
00:32:14,995 --> 00:32:18,164
Scott: He isn't so good at transforming Electricity.

455
00:32:18,305 --> 00:32:19,771
Scott: Yeah, he has electricity powers.

456
00:32:19,811 --> 00:32:21,558
Scott: He can recharge his phone just wherever he is.

457
00:32:21,578 --> 00:32:21,940
Rym: season two.

458
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:25,217
Rym: He keeps reading like books on Maxwell like he's gonna be dangerous someday.

459
00:32:25,237 --> 00:32:25,760
Rym: I think sure.

460
00:32:26,521 --> 00:32:38,680
Scott: But anyway, you have this family and the story is that their dad was like the best tonic II Into an entire fucking mountain to fool some Tengu who are super powerful.

461
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:39,925
Rym: Yeah, cuz Tengu are.

462
00:32:40,066 --> 00:32:43,480
Rym: Tengu are like one step below gods in this world.

463
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:50,460
Scott: So this guy was basically like the legendary god tanuki and this is his wife and and his idiot for idiot son.

464
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,725
Rym: And he's also an idiot.

465
00:32:51,926 --> 00:32:52,086
Rym: Sure.

466
00:32:52,106 --> 00:33:00,380
Scott: You're all idiots as far as we can tell right, but this family especially Inherited the idiot blood from their godlike tanuki.

467
00:33:00,721 --> 00:33:05,556
Rym: He's a blood into four idiot types among his own combined his four children.

468
00:33:05,696 --> 00:33:16,345
Scott: you get him basically But you only have the four children left and they all have different aspects of him and the story mostly focuses on Isaburrow, yep.

469
00:33:16,746 --> 00:33:19,800
Scott: Oh, it's hard to remember all their names because they're all wide Japanese.

470
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,146
Rym: I was the main kid and why?

471
00:33:21,246 --> 00:33:34,300
Rym: what I like the most is that and this sort of is a theme throughout the entire show It is very rare to see non-human characters in fiction who Legitimately are portrayed as having non-human sensibilities.

472
00:33:35,121 --> 00:33:38,252
Rym: Usually you see oh, it's animal people, but it's just people.

473
00:33:38,392 --> 00:34:02,720
Rym: but like the way these characters interact with magic and death and The things around them is very clearly and very specifically Non-human like what happened like oh, yeah dad messed up and the Friday fellows Just cooked him and ate him in a hot pot and like yasaburo is friends with one of the people who murdered his dad and Ate him in a hot pot because that's just a thing that happens sometimes.

474
00:34:03,954 --> 00:34:09,580
Rym: and Then this is sort of exemplified in this character because he's sort of like a laid-back lazy.

475
00:34:09,721 --> 00:34:23,087
Rym: Like my only goal in life is to just get into trouble have an interesting life yep, but as so he just will randomly be a girl for no reason just because like he doesn't really care like gender doesn't really Mean much to him and he's a tonic.

476
00:34:23,167 --> 00:34:25,275
Rym: Yeah, he don't transform into whatever.

477
00:34:25,717 --> 00:34:26,440
Rym: That's just what he can do.

478
00:34:27,541 --> 00:34:32,040
Scott: But yeah, the thing that I like a lot about the show also is that you know, he's the main character, right?

479
00:34:32,161 --> 00:34:40,599
Scott: But usually in an anime a stereotypical generic average anime The main character will always be sort of the character that doesn't have any character.

480
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,139
Scott: They'll be sort of just a generic.

481
00:34:42,321 --> 00:34:43,284
Rym: Why would a room?

482
00:34:43,525 --> 00:34:46,293
Rym: Oh No is like the the perfect archetype.

483
00:34:46,313 --> 00:34:53,380
Scott: the main character is a generic Nobody and all the other characters are interesting and quirky and you care about them.

484
00:34:53,681 --> 00:34:56,009
Scott: But the main character is blessed a full metal Alchemist.

485
00:34:56,069 --> 00:34:58,919
Scott: right Edward Elric is kind of average adventure guy.

486
00:34:59,461 --> 00:35:01,649
Rym: But then you got King Bradley and you're like, what's his?

487
00:35:01,709 --> 00:35:04,438
Scott: do right, but all the other characters are really cool.

488
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:07,380
Scott: or You know, what's another good example?

489
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:14,674
Rym: Like almost any Rishi boyo almost milk toast boring, dude And everyone around him is like a crazy dangerous goddess.

490
00:35:14,855 --> 00:35:22,600
Scott: any mecha show The main pilot of the mech is boring generic person and all the other mech pilots and villains are totally awesome.

491
00:35:23,662 --> 00:35:28,267
Scott: So in this show, however There is no boring generic character.

492
00:35:28,368 --> 00:35:31,898
Scott: right every character is wacky and crazy and interesting.

493
00:35:31,918 --> 00:35:35,012
Scott: So It's like you care about all of them, right?

494
00:35:35,072 --> 00:35:36,480
Scott: I care about this main character.

495
00:35:36,621 --> 00:35:39,190
Scott: Usually the main character is the person you care about the least.

496
00:35:39,752 --> 00:35:43,847
Scott: I can't say I care about the main character the most But there's no characters.

497
00:35:43,887 --> 00:35:44,690
Scott: I don't care about.

498
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:45,794
Scott: there's no characters.

499
00:35:45,834 --> 00:35:47,058
Scott: Like I hate and want to go away.

500
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:52,900
Scott: Yeah It's like they're all you know, even the annoying bad guy brothers with your kaku and king kaku.

501
00:35:53,161 --> 00:35:57,732
Scott: Normally they would be super annoying like oh my god, they're basically Starscream one and Starscream -.

502
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:05,560
Scott: Normally you're like get the fuck out of here, but actually it's like, okay, they're kind of funny, you know, they're not the worst.

503
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,423
Rym: I love all their sisters.

504
00:36:06,463 --> 00:36:08,090
Rym: I was like, oh, there's such pieces of shit.

505
00:36:08,331 --> 00:36:11,705
Rym: But then if anyone else calls them pieces of shit She's like, hey don't make fun of my brothers.

506
00:36:11,765 --> 00:36:12,267
Scott: That's right.

507
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,159
Rym: but Non-human sensibilities so like the.

508
00:36:19,104 --> 00:36:30,087
Rym: The gist of the show like the core of it really is that this family is partly blood relatives and partly just friends of the family like the old Tengu who threw his back out and can't really Tengu around so much anymore.

509
00:36:30,108 --> 00:36:43,034
Rym: and They face the same sort of Nuanced and complex problems that real families do except everything is sort of twisted with this Weird fantastic element like the one.

510
00:36:43,074 --> 00:36:52,408
Rym: brother is depressed But the way that expresses itself is that he transformed into a frog to sit in the bottom of a well because he's depressed and can't face the world anymore.

511
00:36:52,428 --> 00:37:00,653
Rym: and yet he literally like forgets how to Unshift from being a frog and that is like a point of drama in the family.

512
00:37:00,974 --> 00:37:07,799
Rym: and the mom has like a deep phobia of Thunder and dad was murdered by these people who still live in the city and just hang out there.

513
00:37:07,819 --> 00:37:21,040
Scott: and There's kind of really complicated relationships with all the characters way more complicated than anything in Dune Yeah, and like even though you know, they have these sort of complicated relationships that are you know?

514
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,740
Scott: It's like they just still like sort of hang out and talk to people.

515
00:37:24,001 --> 00:37:24,362
Scott: what's like.

516
00:37:24,723 --> 00:37:27,714
Scott: there was a. there was an episode where there's been ten.

517
00:37:27,774 --> 00:37:28,617
Scott: who is the human?

518
00:37:28,697 --> 00:37:36,420
Scott: who a Human who is abducted by a Tengu and got Tengu powers and she's real danger and she's ridiculously powerful.

519
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,931
Scott: And she seems like she's evil.

520
00:37:38,971 --> 00:37:41,060
Scott: and I just like she's so mysterious like what's her deal?

521
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:43,811
Scott: You don't even know and they don't tell you explicitly.

522
00:37:43,851 --> 00:37:48,060
Rym: the show is all about this sort of like Incidental storytelling, right?

523
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:57,585
Scott: But then there's a part where like you Saburo Runs out of town for like a year long period of time to run away from her because she's so mad at him Theoretically, he's afraid

524
00:37:57,605 --> 00:37:58,630
Rym: she's gonna just kill him and eat

525
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:02,066
Scott: him and now when she finally catches him It's just sort of like man.

526
00:38:02,769 --> 00:38:05,520
Scott: It's sort of like this really tense scenes.

527
00:38:05,861 --> 00:38:07,225
Scott: It's a tense episode.

528
00:38:07,245 --> 00:38:09,712
Scott: Well, it's because we're like what's gonna happen here.

529
00:38:09,852 --> 00:38:11,637
Rym: I don't know these characters like.

530
00:38:12,018 --> 00:38:12,560
Rym: it's a world.

531
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,267
Rym: It's a fantastical world.

532
00:38:14,287 --> 00:38:20,556
Rym: So some of the characters like the the Tengu even the old one are Real dangerous to be around.

533
00:38:20,918 --> 00:38:30,318
Rym: Mm-hmm like there's a moment where the Tengu goes on kind of a rampage later in season one and Like I feel like some of the people who are in those cars that were nearby might not have made it maybe

534
00:38:32,242 --> 00:38:40,220
Scott: But like they're just hanging out like, you know, there'll be ones like one minute They'll like be getting drunk with this dude and the next minute like they're running away from because he's so dangerous.

535
00:38:40,360 --> 00:39:02,929
Rym: So the problems and like the relationships are very much non-human and mystical But at the same time they evoke all the feelings that real families have with the real family drama Like, you know, you've got your brother who's depressed and you've got your other brother who's like running for office But he kind of sucks at it and he needs you to help him But you don't want to because you're busy with your own stuff.

536
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:09,514
Rym: and then your old the friend of the family grandpa Who's in love with this woman who's actually really bad for him and all that kind of stuff like it's.

537
00:39:09,916 --> 00:39:16,060
Rym: it's real family drama But it's a bunch of tonic II and Tengu and the family drama is all tonic II and Tengu drama.

538
00:39:16,261 --> 00:39:27,139
Scott: The only thing that makes me uncomfortable in this show is the arranged wedding to the cousin which I guess if you're a tonic II you can get with your cousin, but They're in human form and that's kind of gross.

539
00:39:29,182 --> 00:39:30,086
Rym: I don't think that's so bad.

540
00:39:30,126 --> 00:39:32,075
Scott: That's so that is cousin fucking.

541
00:39:32,557 --> 00:39:36,565
Scott: not so bad Books array, but it in the books.

542
00:39:36,645 --> 00:39:43,487
Rym: Rym says cousin fucking not so bad is arranged cousin marriages and things like that are not that uncommon Even today around the world.

543
00:39:43,789 --> 00:39:46,700
Scott: I'm saying that's not a good thing Even though it's true.

544
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:52,518
Rym: There was like a sideshow recently that was talking about how actually the danger of cousin is way low.

545
00:39:52,538 --> 00:39:52,598
Rym: Rym.

546
00:39:53,221 --> 00:39:54,576
Scott: I guess Rym has some hot cousins.

547
00:39:54,616 --> 00:40:02,906
Scott: He's looking Also Who's in favor of cousin screwing?

548
00:40:02,946 --> 00:40:03,387
Scott: Not Scott?

549
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:08,480
Rym: I point out a big part of that anti cousin romance the eccentric family.

550
00:40:08,831 --> 00:40:27,832
Rym: You know the the the shimo gamo family that we're talking about is like the the known idiot branch of like the greater family and their related family the Ebisugawa who are all they're like the more noble like they have real jobs and things family and there's sort of this weird fighting family Rivalry like.

551
00:40:27,873 --> 00:40:34,860
Rym: they're two Important bloodlines that are tied in ancient times and that was like an arranged marriage to combine them again.

552
00:40:35,321 --> 00:40:39,277
Rym: But then it broke up because the father was dead and there's a whole bunch of plot around that too.

553
00:40:39,458 --> 00:40:41,992
Rym: Mm-hmm I liked out the girl cow.

554
00:40:42,515 --> 00:40:43,280
Rym: Oh, what's her name?

555
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:47,131
Rym: There's just so the girl who was a cousin.

556
00:40:47,151 --> 00:40:52,326
Rym: Yeah, who was pledged to be married to ya Saburo Won't let him see her.

557
00:40:52,787 --> 00:40:53,048
Scott: Yeah.

558
00:40:53,229 --> 00:40:56,300
Rym: He has never seen what she looks like and there's some great scenes.

559
00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:03,268
Rym: We're like, they're in a bathhouse like on opposite sides yelling at each other and fighting But she won't let him see her at any point.

560
00:41:03,288 --> 00:41:04,712
Rym: Mm-hmm, but they're still friends.

561
00:41:04,732 --> 00:41:12,820
Rym: Like everyone's even the enemies are relatively friendly Except where there's a few points where there are some enemies who are not friendly.

562
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:17,192
Scott: But that's right and they can go from being friendly to like.

563
00:41:17,212 --> 00:41:19,980
Scott: is this huge range of interactions between?

564
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:23,894
Rym: Characters cousin marriage are legal and considered totally normal in Japan.

565
00:41:23,994 --> 00:41:32,300
Scott: in quotes in the chat great Sure, that's that rims moving to Japan to get with this Japanese cousin.

566
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:38,674
Rym: But uh Yeah, I don't want to spoil anything cuz I mean the.

567
00:41:38,694 --> 00:41:39,680
Rym: really this is a review, right?

568
00:41:40,281 --> 00:41:41,666
Rym: You should just watch this show.

569
00:41:41,687 --> 00:41:43,233
Rym: It is one of the best anime to come out.

570
00:41:43,253 --> 00:41:47,227
Scott: Not only is the show Good enough to be worth watching.

571
00:41:47,287 --> 00:41:49,154
Scott: I won't put it as a plus anime.

572
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:50,600
Scott: I'll just put it as a anime.

573
00:41:50,982 --> 00:42:03,040
Scott: It's not a legendary all-time show, but not only is it so great It's not animated like in a special way It's just well animated like the arts and the character designs especially are so good.

574
00:42:03,421 --> 00:42:09,180
Scott: You know between all the different forms the katana keys take and things like that and people are wearing different clothes and different scenes.

575
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:09,762
Scott: It's like y'all.

576
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:11,447
Scott: they put effort into this thing, right?

577
00:42:11,508 --> 00:42:12,290
Scott: It's never like.

578
00:42:12,531 --> 00:42:15,320
Scott: there aren't a lot of garbage animation mistakes and things.

579
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:21,020
Rym: All those scenes were like Benton is dragging that one drunk guy around on the roofs.

580
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:21,561
Scott: Yeah, like.

581
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:24,751
Rym: they're all just deeply Japanese and beautiful.

582
00:42:25,252 --> 00:42:27,940
Rym: and if you've been to Kyoto it that is Kyoto like one.

583
00:42:28,021 --> 00:42:30,260
Scott: Oh, yeah, everything is just taken from actual real.

584
00:42:31,223 --> 00:42:37,899
Rym: No, like a lot of the places you see in the show like we've been there Yep, but the number one reason to watch this show is simply that it's unique.

585
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:41,877
Scott: There's no animes like this besides this one that I can think of.

586
00:42:41,937 --> 00:42:42,580
Rym: not that we're good.

587
00:42:42,841 --> 00:42:48,800
Scott: Yeah, this is the only anime that is like this and that alone makes it worth watching even if it were bad.

588
00:42:49,063 --> 00:42:50,140
Scott: But guess what is good?

589
00:42:50,682 --> 00:42:51,244
Scott: So watch it.

590
00:42:51,706 --> 00:42:55,500
Rym: and season two is on crunchyroll and season one was re-added to crunchyroll.

591
00:42:55,821 --> 00:42:56,344
Rym: So you can get.

592
00:42:56,364 --> 00:42:59,479
Scott: season one was temporarily removed from crunchyroll, but now is back.

593
00:43:00,022 --> 00:43:04,199
Rym: So one annoyance though, they changed the translation direction in season two.

594
00:43:04,501 --> 00:43:04,802
Rym: Oh real.

595
00:43:04,842 --> 00:43:07,873
Rym: so they so like in season one the their dad.

596
00:43:08,074 --> 00:43:10,945
Rym: he had a title that nice a Mon Yep in season two.

597
00:43:10,985 --> 00:43:15,419
Rym: They actually just translate that literally to what to like tricksters I forget already.

598
00:43:15,941 --> 00:43:26,090
Rym: But it's like there's a set of Japanese terms that are translated literally and a set that are translated That are not translated and you just get like these Japanese.

599
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:30,572
Scott: I mean philosophically it should be Translating to English, right?

600
00:43:30,613 --> 00:43:36,020
Scott: Yeah, but in season two They saw that you're just used to seeing nice a Mon because they did a bad job in season one.

601
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,853
Scott: Yeah, but now you don't know what they're saying.

602
00:43:37,873 --> 00:43:44,960
Rym: in season two Some words that were translated are now not and some words that were not translated are now translated.

603
00:43:45,181 --> 00:43:49,716
Rym: Yeah, and they also they'd stop calling the Friday fellows and call him the Friday Club.

604
00:43:49,736 --> 00:43:53,411
Scott: I Think actually I remember Friday Club seems closer.

605
00:43:53,551 --> 00:43:55,359
Scott: Well, no, I remember hearing with my ear.

606
00:43:55,661 --> 00:43:59,860
Scott: So yeah, the word club boo as someone was talking.

607
00:44:00,402 --> 00:44:03,577
Scott: So, I don't know where the Friday fellows part came from.

608
00:44:03,597 --> 00:44:08,780
Rym: Yeah I also really wonder what their deal is cuz it seems like it's just a bunch of schlubby humans.

609
00:44:09,061 --> 00:44:13,900
Scott: Yeah, it seems like that's the one scary old guy except for the scary old guy who seems to have some kind of power.

610
00:44:14,021 --> 00:44:26,849
Scott: It seems like it's just a you know a human meetup group that no different than like anything else on meetup.com like it's just some people who hang out and Making a hotpot once a year is just a thing they do and they don't have any sort of well

611
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:37,074
Rym: Like when yasaburo is sort of trip forced or tricked into performing for them and he does a bunch of transformations And they don't seem to really understand that.

612
00:44:37,094 --> 00:44:38,340
Rym: that's legit real magic.

613
00:44:38,722 --> 00:44:39,547
Scott: No, well the get.

614
00:44:39,587 --> 00:44:44,719
Scott: then again, the old guy wasn't there at that time true The old guy who seems to know anything so besides Benton.

615
00:44:45,301 --> 00:44:49,152
Rym: Uh, the one thing I can say about that old guy is I noticed something.

616
00:44:49,594 --> 00:44:56,964
Rym: that old guy is the only person I have ever seen Benton in any way Respect.

617
00:44:57,345 --> 00:45:01,140
Rym: Yep, which implies that he is way dangerous.

618
00:45:01,241 --> 00:45:11,220
Scott: He definitely was the only person in the show Character in the show where you're like, whoa, that dude is actually evil bad guy or at least like dangerous.

619
00:45:11,462 --> 00:45:13,139
Scott: Yeah, like watch out for him.

620
00:45:13,501 --> 00:45:17,847
Rym: But you know, I keep saying subtle but the show is super subtle in that It has.

621
00:45:17,887 --> 00:45:19,760
Rym: it has a lot of really big funny moments and everything.

622
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:27,800
Rym: It's just a great show all around but so much of the story and so much of the nuance is just sort of Like the show doesn't come out and tell you thing.

623
00:45:28,121 --> 00:45:33,340
Scott: Everything in the show is completely unspoken for anything that matters is like not said out loud.

624
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:37,652
Scott: You know it just you have to watch it to understand and show.

625
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:38,375
Scott: but it's not like.

626
00:45:38,395 --> 00:45:40,240
Scott: it's like easier to follow than like utenna.

627
00:45:40,421 --> 00:45:42,045
Scott: Yeah, but it's they don't.

628
00:45:42,226 --> 00:45:42,727
Scott: no one says.

629
00:45:42,767 --> 00:45:47,280
Rym: but utenna is like allegorical and obtuse on purpose to make these meta points.

630
00:45:47,541 --> 00:45:48,546
Rym: This show is just.

631
00:45:48,828 --> 00:45:51,079
Rym: it trusts you to be paying attention while you're watching it.

632
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:55,020
Rym: Because if you pay attention you can figure out a good chunk of Benton's backstory.

633
00:45:55,421 --> 00:45:58,212
Rym: You can figure out a lot about why the family's the way it is.

634
00:45:58,694 --> 00:46:03,709
Rym: and I just really like Media that respect the audience to figure shit out on their own.

635
00:46:04,371 --> 00:46:09,747
Rym: and especially because the stuff you can figure out isn't super important You can enjoy it Even if you don't notice those.

636
00:46:09,807 --> 00:46:14,262
Scott: and knowing that it was originally novels I would really like for the novels to be Translated.

637
00:46:14,282 --> 00:46:16,530
Scott: a lot of stuff is always like light novels and like.

638
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:20,265
Scott: I have no interest in those but like actual novel I want to read dead.

639
00:46:20,808 --> 00:46:25,328
Rym: So briefly I will say that not only the show great But I've watched half of season two.

640
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:27,075
Rym: It is also great.

641
00:46:27,115 --> 00:46:28,400
Scott: It just keeps me sure it is.

642
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:42,860
Rym: I've never watched any season two though season two has a lot more serious dangerous stuff a lot of jikoku like hell and Love me some hell and all sorts of nonsense starts appearing at a call doom guy get your hell problem.

643
00:46:43,202 --> 00:46:44,349
Rym: Oh my god rock us.

644
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:45,677
Rym: All I'm gonna say no spoilers.

645
00:46:45,717 --> 00:46:45,858
Rym: here.

646
00:46:45,878 --> 00:46:49,772
Rym: a character Ends up in hell.

647
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:54,433
Scott: Yeah, and Hell is great, of course it is.

648
00:46:54,513 --> 00:46:56,280
Rym: hell is like super great.

649
00:46:56,541 --> 00:47:00,667
Rym: Of course, I can't key taro's hanging out down there But you see the hell stuff it is.

650
00:47:01,169 --> 00:47:03,760
Rym: it is exactly what you Scott want it to be.

651
00:47:04,001 --> 00:47:09,373
Scott: It is so perfect demons dancing and having a good time that are all freaky Yeah, but also like no.

652
00:47:09,413 --> 00:47:10,420
Rym: seriously, this is hell.

653
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,505
Rym: This is a good place.

654
00:47:11,545 --> 00:47:13,896
Scott: real bad people getting set on fire because they were so bad.

655
00:47:13,936 --> 00:47:14,478
Scott: They deserve it.

656
00:47:15,302 --> 00:47:19,320
Scott: Yeah, but maybe not everyone there deserves also Satan's a total badass who loves metal.

657
00:47:22,106 --> 00:47:24,121
Rym: So, I guess That's it Like.

658
00:47:24,181 --> 00:47:29,990
Rym: we're gonna talk to a few spoilers because I don't want to talk about some like the whole season so you can come back After you've seen the show, so I don't know.

659
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:30,996
Scott: I don't really have anything else to say.

660
00:47:31,037 --> 00:47:31,540
Scott: we want to spoil.

661
00:47:31,804 --> 00:47:32,679
Rym: All right, I won't spoil it.

662
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:34,064
Scott: We already spoil some stuff.

663
00:47:34,325 --> 00:47:48,156
Rym: my favorite scene in season one is there's a trope that you've seen in some movies and TV shows but you know the trope where there's a bunch of characters with a bunch of plots and then They all end up in the same restaurant.

664
00:47:48,256 --> 00:47:48,940
Scott: You mean like snatch?

665
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:57,606
Rym: Yeah, like snatch where everyone just happens to be in the same place at the same time when the car accident happened and then Everyone realizes what's going on and all hell breaks loose.

666
00:47:58,307 --> 00:48:05,743
Rym: That's kind of how season one ends and the scene with a bunch of tanuki Scattering.

667
00:48:05,763 --> 00:48:08,320
Rym: Mm-hmm is one of the funniest things I've seen.

668
00:48:08,681 --> 00:48:11,951
Scott: We can make all the hot pods we want like that scene.

669
00:48:12,512 --> 00:48:15,040
Rym: I was laughing so hard during that scene.

670
00:48:15,762 --> 00:48:16,344
Rym: I like.

671
00:48:16,946 --> 00:48:22,365
Rym: I guess it's get like how when you like you watch a lot of anime that aren't that great you kind of forget What a great anime is like.

672
00:48:22,425 --> 00:48:26,400
Rym: and then you see a great anime again like when we were watching a bunch of crappy shows.

673
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:29,752
Scott: Yeah, I'm just watching like generic your pedal, which I'm not gonna stop watching.

674
00:48:29,932 --> 00:48:30,896
Rym: It's good, but it's not.

675
00:48:30,916 --> 00:48:32,743
Scott: it's not something That's memorable.

676
00:48:32,783 --> 00:48:38,970
Rym: watching cuz there's bikes in but then you watch like a random episode of Ava and you're like, oh shit Right and real anime exists.

677
00:48:39,071 --> 00:48:39,594
Scott: It's out there.

678
00:48:39,654 --> 00:48:40,840
Scott: Just doesn't come around too often.

679
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:46,400
Rym: Yeah, so if you're looking for some great anime to watch you should watch eccentric family.

680
00:48:46,922 --> 00:48:48,006
Rym: It is so good.

681
00:48:48,167 --> 00:48:50,577
Scott: My favorite scene and part is the bathhouse.

682
00:48:50,597 --> 00:48:51,280
Scott: There's a whole episode.

683
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:55,040
Scott: Yeah, there's a whole episode in a bathhouse and it's awesome.

684
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:56,947
Scott: There's so much going on in that one.

685
00:48:56,988 --> 00:48:59,939
Scott: like almost most of the episode happens just in the bathhouse.

686
00:49:00,361 --> 00:49:04,100
Scott: There's that iron underwear that they had and they keep the iron underwear going.

687
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:06,120
Scott: Yeah, all this stuff keeps coming back.

688
00:49:06,562 --> 00:49:08,289
Rym: You two pieces of shit you not on.

689
00:49:08,309 --> 00:49:10,759
Rym: did you not realize the failure of your underwear plan?

690
00:49:10,799 --> 00:49:16,060
Scott: the Fujin Raijin fan from the very beginning of the show comes back at the end of the show, right?

691
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:20,830
Rym: There's also this song that'll play in the back cuz it does pretty good soundtrack.

692
00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:25,262
Rym: Like it's kind of nondescript doo doo doo doo doo That one.

693
00:49:25,483 --> 00:49:36,948
Rym: but no there's there's the one that's kind of jazzy that whenever it starts Shenanigans are about to follow and it's gonna be the tonic use fault Mmm, and that song you start to recognize it.

694
00:49:36,968 --> 00:49:38,133
Rym: cuz the season do they keep that up.

695
00:49:38,454 --> 00:49:40,120
Rym: stuff will be serious serious.

696
00:49:40,621 --> 00:49:42,166
Rym: And then the song starts playing.

697
00:49:42,186 --> 00:49:45,356
Rym: and the next thing, you know tonic explosion tonic everywhere.

698
00:49:45,376 --> 00:49:50,244
Rym: Mmm say I watch the show and Don't let the drunk.

699
00:49:50,304 --> 00:49:58,938
Rym: old Tengu drink all the port wine if the tea kettle that's letting your flying ship continue to fly Also needs port wine to keep flying.

700
00:49:59,682 --> 00:50:00,605
Rym: That is like the moral.

701
00:50:00,866 --> 00:50:02,030
Scott: they just bring more.

702
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:04,720
Rym: part one they did and he drunk it.

703
00:50:04,967 --> 00:50:12,102
Rym: No You notice they had another box that was like behind a bunch of stuff and there's a shot where you see that that box is Also all drunk.

704
00:50:12,824 --> 00:50:15,411
Scott: Yeah, I mean they could have just brought yet another box.

705
00:50:15,531 --> 00:50:20,400
Rym: I get another but I think they brought twice as much as They needed three times as much.

706
00:50:21,401 --> 00:50:22,966
Rym: Like I feel like that.

707
00:50:23,006 --> 00:50:24,310
Rym: Tengu could literally drink.

708
00:50:24,511 --> 00:50:26,497
Scott: also, why is that guy hooked on port so much?

709
00:50:26,537 --> 00:50:27,320
Scott: doesn't he like anything?

710
00:50:28,806 --> 00:50:35,400
Scott: Well, he also likes us really really really long cigars Mmm, I mean if you're a Tengu fine, it's not gonna hurt you, right?

711
00:50:36,202 --> 00:50:39,860
Scott: If I and if I was some sort of mystical being I'd be doing all kinds of dangerous drugs and shit.

712
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:46,262
Scott: I also enjoy the joy the sort of subtext that yes Alvaro is definitely like if I see someone smoking and I say man That's gross.

713
00:50:46,282 --> 00:50:46,744
Scott: Stop that shit.

714
00:50:46,764 --> 00:50:50,360
Scott: You're poisoning yourself to death and say actually no, I'm magical and this doesn't hurt me at all.

715
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:51,826
Scott: I would say damn I'm jealous.

716
00:50:51,866 --> 00:50:52,809
Scott: I would do that if I were you.

717
00:50:52,829 --> 00:50:55,439
Rym: but that cigar is like more than a foot long.

718
