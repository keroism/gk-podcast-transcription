1
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,724
Rym: It's Thursday, March 16th, 2017.

2
00:00:12,724 --> 00:00:13,185
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,907 --> 00:00:17,477
Rym: I'm not wearing a grandpa sweater And this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:17,938 --> 00:00:26,749
Rym: We ain't afraid of no sleep, and we ain't afraid of no bed busted Literally talking about beds, but not sleep only beds.

5
00:00:28,374 --> 00:00:29,407
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,834 --> 00:00:31,359
Rym: So yeah, we're.

7
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,469
Rym: uh we're back from PAX.

8
00:00:33,212 --> 00:00:40,010
Rym: This was the worst weather that has ever occurred out of PAX in the history of PAX as far as I can tell.

9
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:40,492
Scott: That is true.

10
00:00:40,753 --> 00:00:44,550
Rym: It was dangerously cold coupled with the fact that Boston

11
00:00:44,771 --> 00:00:45,615
Scott: It was woman cold

12
00:00:45,736 --> 00:00:56,327
Rym: being the city of cowards Not only forces packs to have ridiculous security where they check Everyone's bag coming in and out of the convention center and the convention center holds at one time like 40,000 people.

13
00:00:58,232 --> 00:01:00,110
Rym: But they also have metal detectors.

14
00:01:00,552 --> 00:01:05,090
Rym: So the lines take forever and people were trapped outside of the dangerous cold.

15
00:01:05,814 --> 00:01:07,160
Rym: And it was a giant shit show.

16
00:01:07,462 --> 00:01:10,555
Scott: it wasn't just witches tit cold It was like it was witches.

17
00:01:10,615 --> 00:01:12,181
Scott: lesbian orgy cold.

18
00:01:12,682 --> 00:01:18,304
Scott: well, which is lesbian orgy sounds great sure But it's also really cold which is don't heat up when they get it on.

19
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:19,670
Rym: you're thinking of the wrong kind of witch.

20
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:21,681
Scott: Imagine getting it on with like a block of ice.

21
00:01:23,992 --> 00:01:26,361
Rym: Maybe the Ice King is a better example.

22
00:01:26,462 --> 00:01:28,570
Scott: Well, that's what a witch is only the Ice King's a dude.

23
00:01:31,973 --> 00:01:41,370
Rym: But on top of all that like I put it this way it was so cold like I ski right It was cold enough to where that's the kind of weather where I say it's too cold to ski, and I don't go skiing.

24
00:01:42,372 --> 00:01:43,582
Scott: It's always too cold to ski.

25
00:01:43,864 --> 00:01:45,749
Rym: No You're just a baby.

26
00:01:46,393 --> 00:01:48,502
Rym: But this is kind of why I like cuz.

27
00:01:48,522 --> 00:01:56,550
Rym: you know we dish anime Boston this year And the reason was actually straight up cuz I know isn't it like next week or the week after or something in April sometime?

28
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,881
Rym: I don't even know cuz I didn't you know do anything.

29
00:01:59,001 --> 00:02:00,086
Scott: It's too soon is the point.

30
00:02:00,408 --> 00:02:10,717
Rym: but The actual reason we skipped anime Boston this year is because the security getting an anime Boston is even more of a shit show Because I guess anime Boston doesn't have as much clout.

31
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:16,558
Rym: so like the city does way worse security for them than they do for even packs And there's way less places.

32
00:02:16,598 --> 00:02:29,606
Rym: so the lines are even worse than anime Boston, but I don't know if I can ever go back to anime Boston cuz even PAX East is trying my patience like The fact that I can mostly skip the line is the only reason I go to PAX East anymore.

33
00:02:29,646 --> 00:02:32,430
Rym: as much as I love packs It's a real annoying.

34
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:44,884
Rym: I really hope packs leaves Boston when their contract is up with Boston because this shit is real bad And I think PAX East is going to be For the foreseeable future the only Boston convention we will ever go to.

35
00:02:44,924 --> 00:02:48,477
Scott: yeah when there's conventions in the Javits There's no fucking security.

36
00:02:48,497 --> 00:02:51,970
Scott: you can just walk right into the auto show PAX Prime packs, Australia.

37
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:57,596
Rym: You just walk in and wander around and while San Antonio has their you know security Multiple times.

38
00:02:57,657 --> 00:03:05,837
Rym: I went into that line which took two seconds and the dude Literally looked at my bag that was not open looked up at me and just gave me the head nod of yeah Just go in.

39
00:03:05,918 --> 00:03:06,730
Scott: that's called being white.

40
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,209
Rym: Yeah, that's the separate problem.

41
00:03:10,872 --> 00:03:17,615
Rym: But I do think that pack San Antonio is mostly just checking for people who are carrying guns in because there's weird guns Stuff in Texas.

42
00:03:17,877 --> 00:03:20,470
Scott: yeah, you can carry a gun outside the convention center all you want.

43
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:23,874
Scott: You just can't bring it in the building because it's Texas And that's how they do.

44
00:03:23,974 --> 00:03:30,821
Scott: so they have to check everyone to make sure you're not trying to sneak one in there because it's totally Cool to just walk around with one right outside.

45
00:03:30,982 --> 00:03:42,849
Rym: well totally cool by the law But not totally cool by like modern human standards no, but all that aside uh My laundry room has been unavailable for about a week in this building.

46
00:03:43,331 --> 00:03:44,595
Scott: You haven't done laundry in a week.

47
00:03:45,077 --> 00:03:48,670
Rym: uh no which luckily our laundry was like a hundred percent ahead.

48
00:03:48,891 --> 00:03:52,229
Scott: Why don't you just bring your laundry to some nice Greek lady like I do who do it for you?

49
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,481
Rym: Because we I mean the lottery in the building is nice.

50
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:55,186
Rym: It's not like yours.

51
00:03:55,206 --> 00:03:55,850
Rym: that takes forever.

52
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:59,484
Scott: I was like real good whatever, but you know why has it been unavailable?

53
00:03:59,524 --> 00:04:08,797
Rym: so the last time this happened It was because an unnamed young lady who I would guess was in her early 20s Started a fire in the dryer.

54
00:04:08,817 --> 00:04:11,046
Rym: because you know how do you start a fire in the dryer?

55
00:04:11,067 --> 00:04:11,850
Rym: what lots of ways?

56
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:13,149
Scott: What did you put in there like?

57
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:13,911
Scott: Matches.

58
00:04:14,252 --> 00:04:18,870
Rym: so the primary way dryer fires start and I know a lot about dryer fires cuz my dad was a fireman.

59
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:23,286
Scott: So it's not empty the lint you take the lint don't throw it in one you don't empty the lint.

60
00:04:23,386 --> 00:04:24,952
Rym: and there's a surprising number Of adults.

61
00:04:25,113 --> 00:04:26,137
Scott: lint is way flammable.

62
00:04:26,157 --> 00:04:31,375
Rym: Yeah, don't know you have to do that like you would be surprised How many people literally don't know.

63
00:04:31,415 --> 00:04:36,630
Rym: lint traps exist own houses and have completely clogged lint traps?

64
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,770
Scott: I empty the lint before and after every time I use the dryer.

65
00:04:39,951 --> 00:04:42,222
Rym: I'm like obsessed with the lint trap stuff.

66
00:04:42,262 --> 00:04:43,106
Scott: Also lint is awesome.

67
00:04:43,146 --> 00:04:46,650
Rym: We yeah Actually, I got a new shirt and something happened to me.

68
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:47,962
Rym: That is not happening to me many years.

69
00:04:48,224 --> 00:04:50,376
Rym: at the end of the day I had a whole bunch of belly button lint.

70
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:51,902
Scott: I have belly button every day.

71
00:04:52,163 --> 00:04:53,770
Rym: I do not get belly button lint.

72
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,359
Rym: I guess the shirt just like you have an Audi belly button.

73
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,764
Rym: I got a pretty deep belly button.

74
00:04:57,784 --> 00:04:58,527
Rym: It's just no lint.

75
00:04:58,587 --> 00:05:03,307
Rym: in there There's a couple is like a speck of lint.

76
00:05:03,348 --> 00:05:05,353
Scott: I guess That was it.

77
00:05:05,595 --> 00:05:06,541
Scott: I have like too many layers.

78
00:05:06,601 --> 00:05:07,729
Scott: I can't get to the lint hold on.

79
00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:13,309
Rym: wow We haven't done a show in a while because of the snowstorm and everything and I suddenly here's my here's my lint for today.

80
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:15,725
Rym: I'd say there's decent amount of lint back there.

81
00:05:15,745 --> 00:05:16,269
Scott: It's a little guy.

82
00:05:16,911 --> 00:05:29,185
Rym: so anyway, the other thing that'll cause the fires is the motor burns out because you have a shitty ass dryer and While your lint trap is clean There's lint inside your dryer and all these places you have no idea about.

83
00:05:29,225 --> 00:05:34,330
Scott: especially you have a crappy Top-loading dry and there's a spark somewhere inside the dryer that catches the lint on fire.

84
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:35,413
Rym: Something like that.

85
00:05:35,614 --> 00:05:38,964
Rym: or a wire will heat up and start a smolder of some lint.

86
00:05:39,285 --> 00:05:42,764
Rym: and then you know when the dryer kicks in And air comes pretty much all lint related.

87
00:05:43,127 --> 00:05:54,890
Rym: Yeah The lint if you have external lint exhaust and air exhaust lint gets in there and actually, you know You know that ours blows out the building, you know that accordion style like two people use.

88
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:58,161
Rym: Yeah ain't supposed to use that shit that she has been deprecated.

89
00:05:58,181 --> 00:06:02,394
Rym: You're supposed to use straight steel Tubing like pipes.

90
00:06:02,997 --> 00:06:03,238
Scott: No.

91
00:06:03,418 --> 00:06:10,643
Rym: All right, and if you have turk corners, you should have a Steel or a pipe corner not one of those elastic foldy things.

92
00:06:10,944 --> 00:06:14,618
Rym: if you have the elastic floaty thing fully things You should clean them or replace them like every year.

93
00:06:14,638 --> 00:06:19,078
Scott: All right, if I see any of those around in anyone's house I'll let them know like that's bad news.

94
00:06:19,621 --> 00:06:19,802
Rym: Mm-hmm.

95
00:06:20,164 --> 00:06:21,390
Rym: There's probably a lot of lint in there.

96
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:31,563
Rym: I've also seen people because I was remember we were trying to buy houses and Beacon who are literally just venting that lint like Into their walls are at it because they don't realize you're

97
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:32,990
Scott: supposed to vent it out of your house like

98
00:06:33,331 --> 00:06:40,229
Rym: Yeah, like people who have a you know, the the grease hood that usually those just go back into the kitchen through the grease filter But sometimes they go out of the house.

99
00:06:40,611 --> 00:06:45,109
Rym: I've seen houses where they look like they're going out of the house, but they actually just go into the attic.

100
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:59,689
Scott: Yeah Even in my mom's house, which is way old Right if you're in the backyard and the dryers on you can see there's this thing on the back of the house And is definitely air coming out because you can tell when you're outside if the dryers on or not.

101
00:07:00,672 --> 00:07:09,950
Rym: But the other cause of dryer fires are people who either put clothing That cannot be put in a dryer in a dryer that has flammable shit in it.

102
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,357
Scott: What kind of clothing is this?

103
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:13,949
Rym: some kinds of sports stuff some kinds of high-fashion stuff?

104
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,370
Rym: cosplay stuff often Anything that has certain kinds of vine?

105
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:21,108
Scott: I mean that's got to be something kind of really weird that you put.

106
00:07:21,188 --> 00:07:24,389
Scott: I mean I imagine like vinyl would just melt in there if it's too hot.

107
00:07:25,134 --> 00:07:27,326
Rym: So it might melt depending on how hot the dryer is.

108
00:07:27,386 --> 00:07:28,030
Rym: it might melt.

109
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,356
Scott: But how could it start a fire?

110
00:07:29,376 --> 00:07:30,381
Rym: but that is older.

111
00:07:30,401 --> 00:07:32,430
Rym: it doesn't have to necessarily start a fire fire.

112
00:07:32,813 --> 00:07:35,289
Rym: Most fire fires actually just cause a lot of smoke damage.

113
00:07:36,312 --> 00:07:36,593
Scott: You know what?

114
00:07:36,613 --> 00:07:37,035
Scott: It could be.

115
00:07:37,055 --> 00:07:48,250
Scott: it could be something that's like that goes in there Right and heats up a whole bunch and it like traps the heat in such a way So that the cotton touching it then starts on fire.

116
00:07:48,631 --> 00:07:49,937
Rym: All sorts of mechanisms right.

117
00:07:49,998 --> 00:07:52,710
Scott: like the dryer itself doesn't get hot enough.

118
00:07:53,292 --> 00:07:55,761
Scott: You know it doesn't spit out hot enough air to burn cotton.

119
00:07:55,801 --> 00:07:58,130
Scott: otherwise obviously every dryer would start a fire ever.

120
00:07:58,653 --> 00:08:01,489
Scott: But maybe you could put like for example a pizza stone in there.

121
00:08:01,945 --> 00:08:03,235
Rym: Yeah don't put a pizza stone in there.

122
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:11,430
Scott: and then or a piece of a pizza stone and the piece of a pizza stone keep getting Hotter and hotter and hotter as it absorbs heat and eventually some cottons touching it would ignite.

123
00:08:12,115 --> 00:08:12,477
Scott: I don't know.

124
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:14,130
Scott: I'm just guessing that might not be possible.

125
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:20,770
Rym: People will leave say a cell phone with a big-ass battery in their dryer in their pocket and do wash it.

126
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,834
Rym: So it's nice and wet.

127
00:08:22,457 --> 00:08:25,370
Scott: and why is your cell phone not on your body at all times?

128
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:36,089
Rym: But the other off thing that'll happen is if certain kinds of clothes if you clean them with certain kinds of solvents like fancy clothes And there's some of that solvent left that will smolder or ignite in the hot dryer.

129
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:42,390
Rym: Lots of ways you can cause a. you can put such a heavy load that it burns out the motor and causes a smoke problem.

130
00:08:42,611 --> 00:08:44,076
Scott: Flammable is in flammable.

131
00:08:44,135 --> 00:08:46,083
Rym: Yeah, I watched that episode recently.

132
00:08:46,144 --> 00:08:49,276
Rym: Okay, go to their old Simpsons Last night.

133
00:08:49,296 --> 00:08:50,427
Rym: We just watched the gabbo episode.

134
00:08:52,892 --> 00:08:53,616
Scott: He's also flow.

135
00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:01,310
Rym: so the first time this happened, uh We're in the apartment and we're asleep and I start I wake up and I have that danger sense.

136
00:09:01,371 --> 00:09:03,469
Rym: You know, sometimes you like danger sense like something's wrong.

137
00:09:04,192 --> 00:09:10,959
Rym: Rabbits are thumping like something's wrong and I said that rabbit warning system And I smell like a little bit of smoke.

138
00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:13,690
Rym: and you know, dad a fireman I mean there's smoke there's fine.

139
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:20,690
Rym: I jump out of bed I'm like, ah fuck and I turn on the light and there is like this burning smell and a little bit of smoke.

140
00:09:21,031 --> 00:09:28,979
Rym: And it's coming in from the outside of the building as I figured out by doing some air test Trying to figure out if I wasn't in your apartment.

141
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:29,782
Scott: Oh, okay.

142
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:31,067
Scott: Nothing fire extinguisher.

143
00:09:31,227 --> 00:09:31,970
Scott: I go downstairs.

144
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:36,510
Rym: I walk down because you know don't get in the elevator duh, so I go down the stairs.

145
00:09:36,631 --> 00:09:37,517
Rym: I get to the second floor.

146
00:09:37,637 --> 00:09:39,410
Rym: the smoke smoke fire alarm wasn't going off.

147
00:09:39,534 --> 00:09:42,261
Rym: No I get to the first floor and it doesn't get a lot.

148
00:09:42,342 --> 00:09:43,386
Rym: it gets a little stronger.

149
00:09:43,407 --> 00:09:44,613
Scott: a con 911.

150
00:09:44,613 --> 00:09:46,830
Rym: No, cuz I'm I know what I'm doing.

151
00:09:47,190 --> 00:10:02,565
Rym: I get to the ground floor and it smells like smoke and the doorman is standing there looking at this girl And she's just like I just got to go into the laundry room to check on something and he's like there was a fire in There because somebody put something they shouldn't have in the dryer.

152
00:10:02,826 --> 00:10:04,858
Rym: and she was like, it wasn't me I didn't put anything weird in there.

153
00:10:04,878 --> 00:10:06,490
Rym: I just need to check something.

154
00:10:06,994 --> 00:10:08,263
Rym: and he's like what dryer did you use?

155
00:10:08,283 --> 00:10:11,296
Rym: and she's like I Just need to check something.

156
00:10:11,316 --> 00:10:13,306
Rym: I just needed it was definite.

157
00:10:13,326 --> 00:10:14,110
Rym: It was her clothes.

158
00:10:14,471 --> 00:10:16,739
Rym: She put something in there that caused the smoke problem.

159
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:17,542
Rym: Uh-huh.

160
00:10:17,763 --> 00:10:19,750
Rym: The same thing happened again while we were at PAX.

161
00:10:20,513 --> 00:10:22,241
Rym: I assume it was another 20-something.

162
00:10:22,281 --> 00:10:23,346
Rym: It doesn't know how to do laundry.

163
00:10:23,387 --> 00:10:24,070
Rym: I might be wrong.

164
00:10:25,351 --> 00:10:26,776
Rym: I kind of hope it's the same person.

165
00:10:26,796 --> 00:10:30,550
Scott: Okay, that's never happened in my laundry or even RIT's laundry.

166
00:10:31,033 --> 00:10:33,427
Rym: I have an RIT's laundry's all the time.

167
00:10:33,448 --> 00:10:33,850
Scott: Didn't have one.

168
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:34,673
Scott: I was there ever.

169
00:10:34,793 --> 00:10:35,355
Scott: the laundry.

170
00:10:35,576 --> 00:10:39,550
Rym: the laundry room in colony was shut down multiple times for people fucking up shit in there.

171
00:10:39,632 --> 00:10:40,429
Scott: I never had that problem.

172
00:10:40,911 --> 00:10:41,834
Rym: Someone pulled once.

173
00:10:42,135 --> 00:10:43,178
Rym: some of it was vandalism.

174
00:10:43,238 --> 00:10:46,247
Rym: someone filled a bunch of the washers with crayons one time.

175
00:10:46,267 --> 00:10:47,150
Rym: That's bad.

176
00:10:47,391 --> 00:10:50,263
Rym: Yeah, someone put a bunch of bricks in the dryer and turned it on.

177
00:10:50,303 --> 00:10:51,006
Rym: I remember that one.

178
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:51,810
Scott: Don't do that.

179
00:10:53,331 --> 00:10:58,810
Rym: But yeah, so I currently can't do laundry unless I go to a semi-public laundromat and hopefully they will done.

180
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,878
Scott: You just bring your clothes to a nice lady who will clean them.

181
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:01,963
Rym: Yeah, I guess I could.

182
00:11:01,983 --> 00:11:07,444
Rym: that's so decadent weird though And I feel like a better use of my money would be getting a cleaning lady.

183
00:11:07,725 --> 00:11:08,990
Scott: It's not that much more expensive.

184
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:13,400
Scott: It cost me like 20 bucks Which is like what it costs to run all those laundry machines.

185
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:21,109
Rym: to do a load of laundry for us cost like a dollar 50 cost me 250 and the dryer costs like a dollar 250. the washer takes 23 minutes.

186
00:11:21,611 --> 00:11:22,637
Rym: The dryer takes 40 minutes.

187
00:11:22,657 --> 00:11:23,765
Scott: They take 40 minutes each.

188
00:11:23,785 --> 00:11:26,215
Rym: Yeah 40 minute washer.

189
00:11:26,235 --> 00:11:27,562
Rym: what the hell kind of washer do you have?

190
00:11:27,722 --> 00:11:29,170
Scott: and whatever kind of washer they got in the building.

191
00:11:29,591 --> 00:11:31,217
Scott: Top loader no side load.

192
00:11:31,237 --> 00:11:31,618
Scott: All right.

193
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:33,826
Rym: It's making sure cuz top loaders are bullshit.

194
00:11:34,067 --> 00:11:34,869
Scott: It's the ripoff guy.

195
00:11:37,632 --> 00:11:38,393
Rym: That was a tangent.

196
00:11:38,413 --> 00:11:39,175
Rym: you got any news.

197
00:11:39,917 --> 00:11:40,719
Scott: I do have a news.

198
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:47,823
Scott: they announced that they're gonna I guess this is reboot the matrix Movies, so there was only one matrix movie.

199
00:11:48,205 --> 00:11:49,110
Scott: Oh, yeah, there's one of them.

200
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:52,710
Scott: There's one matrix movie and I guess reboot doesn't mean remakes.

201
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:59,870
Rym: They're not gonna retell the same story Which I guess is good because a big part of the matrix was that most of us went into it.

202
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:01,175
Rym: I have no idea what it was about.

203
00:12:01,195 --> 00:12:03,825
Scott: They're gonna tell new stories in the matrix universe.

204
00:12:03,906 --> 00:12:05,411
Rym: So animatrix, that's fine I guess.

205
00:12:05,612 --> 00:12:11,690
Scott: I guess yeah like animatrix only live-action movies and more of them because they got no new ideas.

206
00:12:12,492 --> 00:12:13,775
Rym: My my concern.

207
00:12:13,975 --> 00:12:14,576
Rym: there's two ways.

208
00:12:14,616 --> 00:12:15,178
Rym: This could go.

209
00:12:15,599 --> 00:12:20,570
Rym: it could go the Star Wars like rogue one way where they're all pretty good stories.

210
00:12:21,693 --> 00:12:28,470
Rym: It could also go the like World-building for nerds way because I don't want to learn more about that world.

211
00:12:28,871 --> 00:12:32,526
Scott: Well, there was already that matrix MMO where you could learn everything you need to know about that work.

212
00:12:32,827 --> 00:12:37,241
Rym: Yeah Shame that that was canceled alongside those second two movies.

213
00:12:37,261 --> 00:12:45,118
Scott: They were planning on making yeah, you know, so Matrix is like is like it's the thing about this.

214
00:12:45,218 --> 00:12:49,270
Scott: right is like they're doing this constantly everywhere with everything these days.

215
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:52,120
Rym: But I don't feel like that's a these days thing old man.

216
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,670
Rym: I feel like that's just like it's the same burn rate.

217
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,238
Rym: We talked about this before we went live.

218
00:12:56,358 --> 00:13:02,886
Scott: Anyway, the point is the matrix one is Still so good, and I love it.

219
00:13:03,188 --> 00:13:14,679
Rym: So Is on a very short list of movies that if I'm like at a relative's house or there's a TV somewhere and that Movie is on unless something stops me.

220
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,984
Rym: I'll just wherever it stops.

221
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,430
Rym: I'll just watch it to the end, right?

222
00:13:18,253 --> 00:13:19,618
Rym: It's not episode four.

223
00:13:19,939 --> 00:13:23,703
Rym: if that's on no matter even if it's at the end of the movie beginning the movie I'm just gonna watch it.

224
00:13:24,935 --> 00:13:26,665
Rym: That's just gonna happen, right?

225
00:13:26,826 --> 00:13:35,470
Scott: So You know making more stuff in that universe is sort of like mmm, you know matters for some reason, right?

226
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,462
Scott: Just like making more Star Wars matters.

227
00:13:37,603 --> 00:13:40,068
Scott: No, so Let's see what happens.

228
00:13:40,313 --> 00:13:53,750
Rym: Well, yeah The thing is Star Wars had a lot of mystique in the sense that when we were kids Star Wars was all already out And they're like there was no chance as far as we could tell of them ever making more and the toys weren't being made.

229
00:13:54,071 --> 00:13:58,582
Rym: So like Star Wars stuff was like this thing from a bygone age.

230
00:13:58,602 --> 00:14:00,146
Scott: All right, well think about this right?

231
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:05,164
Scott: what year did Episode one the bad Star Wars movie come out?

232
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:05,967
Rym: bad Star Wars.

233
00:14:06,007 --> 00:14:06,690
Rym: I was in high school.

234
00:14:07,071 --> 00:14:13,462
Scott: Yeah, it was like 98 or 99 right when did Return of the Jedi Come out.

235
00:14:13,845 --> 00:14:14,369
Rym: Oh, that was what?

236
00:14:14,369 --> 00:14:15,892
Rym: 85.

237
00:14:15,892 --> 00:14:17,142
Scott: no, I think it's like 81, right?

238
00:14:19,794 --> 00:14:25,677
Scott: Like the year before you're born 83 83. so we were one year old.

239
00:14:25,777 --> 00:14:26,399
Rym: Yeah, we were.

240
00:14:26,419 --> 00:14:26,900
Rym: we were both.

241
00:14:26,921 --> 00:14:27,061
Rym: we hit.

242
00:14:27,081 --> 00:14:34,109
Rym: so 83 to 99 is how many years some number of years 16 years right between.

243
00:14:34,656 --> 00:14:37,234
Rym: I'm saying there was a lot more Cultural baggage.

244
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:41,565
Scott: I'm just saying there were 16 years between Return of the Jedi and Phantom Menace, right?

245
00:14:41,746 --> 00:14:45,282
Scott: No the matrix one Came out in what year.

246
00:14:45,524 --> 00:14:52,567
Rym: also in high school I think I could drive so pretty much of effectively same time as Phantom Menace.

247
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:55,223
Scott: and How many years ago was that?

248
00:14:55,243 --> 00:14:55,868
Scott: Yep?

249
00:14:55,868 --> 00:15:02,850
Rym: 16 or 17 1999 16 or 17 years between.

250
00:15:03,151 --> 00:15:08,469
Rym: But the matrix did not have extensive toy lines that were mystical to kids.

251
00:15:09,092 --> 00:15:10,878
Rym: The the matrix did not have like.

252
00:15:11,319 --> 00:15:16,316
Rym: you see it and your dad you're like your parents show it to you like hey Here's something you ain't ever seen.

253
00:15:16,336 --> 00:15:16,918
Rym: Yeah.

254
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,083
Scott: Well cuz now we've seen it.

255
00:15:18,464 --> 00:15:20,190
Rym: Yeah, there's very different situations like.

256
00:15:20,852 --> 00:15:25,250
Scott: But I mean the matrix is not Star Wars, but it's still so good.

257
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:28,519
Rym: I'm just not excited about the matrix reboot.

258
00:15:28,539 --> 00:15:29,702
Scott: who said anything about being excited.

259
00:15:29,722 --> 00:15:32,128
Rym: I'm barely even interested in it.

260
00:15:33,175 --> 00:15:42,244
Rym: Cuz I don't feel like There are long interesting long-form stories to tell in that world unless you get into world building Which is literally the last thing I care about.

261
00:15:42,606 --> 00:15:53,030
Rym: in the matrix Animatrix was only good because it was shorts that took the concept of Virtual reality world and like the fact that there's the stuff going on and told really short stories within that.

262
00:15:53,673 --> 00:15:57,050
Rym: But the key I think was that they were short and did not address the world itself.

263
00:15:57,511 --> 00:16:09,228
Scott: Just make some badass action movies with some hacking and some you know Keep the shit in the matrix or shits cool Don't none of this outside the major but the outside of the matrix was inside the matrix - done done.

264
00:16:11,251 --> 00:16:13,190
Rym: It's almost like they're just making it up as they went along.

265
00:16:15,093 --> 00:16:23,490
Rym: Anyway, anyway, so this is a moderately contentious news That was around and a lot of people were reporting on this from a lot of different angles.

266
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:26,103
Scott: You really think this is a much bigger news than I think it is.

267
00:16:26,284 --> 00:16:27,289
Scott: This is like a tiny news.

268
00:16:27,638 --> 00:16:34,750
Rym: It was there So a lot of people who were reporting on it were reporting on it from a particular angle to try to prove various points.

269
00:16:35,373 --> 00:16:51,330
Rym: But the gist of this because this is a minor drama that has happened Perennially because of the internet and the fact that the Americans with Disabilities Act and the extensions to it Don't necessarily fully account for the way that the modern internet progressed.

270
00:16:51,832 --> 00:16:54,606
Rym: I mean, I think the last extension to it was the 1990 ish.

271
00:16:56,372 --> 00:16:57,677
Rym: Anyway, I don't know the.

272
00:16:57,878 --> 00:17:05,666
Rym: uh, so basically the story was that Berkeley Started a university University University of California, Berkeley.

273
00:17:05,707 --> 00:17:10,210
Rym: Yes State University started putting all the things that you know.

274
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:14,666
Rym: They video lectures and they have one set of lectures and videos.

275
00:17:14,686 --> 00:17:15,369
Rym: That's for students.

276
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:25,646
Rym: Like you're in a class you can go to a thing like watch a video lecture but they took like 5,000 of their lectures that they just happen a video of and said skirt and audio to like.

277
00:17:25,665 --> 00:17:36,630
Rym: some of them were just basically like Audio recordings and just put it all on YouTube and iTunes and other places for free saying hey Here's a bunch of educational content and it cost us nothing to just give it to everybody.

278
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:37,937
Scott: Well, it cost Google something cuz.

279
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:38,682
Scott: then what's hosting?

280
00:17:38,702 --> 00:17:40,090
Rym: it cost them nothing, right?

281
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,696
Rym: Just put it out there for people to use.

282
00:17:42,238 --> 00:17:44,247
Rym: I believe most of it was licensed Creative Commons.

283
00:17:44,568 --> 00:17:57,540
Rym: Sure Basically Because of title two of the Americans with Disabilities Act and a lawsuit They were ordered to make all of that free content.

284
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,147
Rym: not for students because they already comply with the ADA.

285
00:18:00,187 --> 00:18:04,457
Rym: for students if a student Needs an accommodation to access course required materials.

286
00:18:04,678 --> 00:18:09,610
Rym: They make that accommodation obviously, but they were not making those accommodations for this free public stuff.

287
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:22,544
Rym: they just put out and Upon examining it they decided that there was no way they could in any reasonable timely or cost-effective fashion Make even general accommodations for all this content.

288
00:18:22,886 --> 00:18:24,010
Rym: They took it all down instead.

289
00:18:25,232 --> 00:18:29,770
Rym: Now they have pledged that they do want to re-release it conforming to these standards.

290
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:35,306
Rym: So subtitles closed captions those sorts of things aren't those the same thing, but it?

291
00:18:35,326 --> 00:18:36,530
Rym: well, they're not actually the same thing.

292
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:38,529
Rym: They're actually very different in subtle ways.

293
00:18:39,712 --> 00:18:43,230
Rym: That could be a whole topic of a show if you want to get into that.

294
00:18:43,551 --> 00:18:48,825
Rym: I waited to learn a lot about that in RIT Anime Club because we we presented subtitled screenings.

295
00:18:48,865 --> 00:18:51,690
Rym: We did not present closed captioning anyway.

296
00:18:53,094 --> 00:19:00,791
Rym: They do want to put it all back online But that's going to be at substantial cost and it'll take a long time to do so effectively.

297
00:19:01,192 --> 00:19:21,479
Rym: all that stuff is offline and the debate is whether or not that Action and everything that happened here serves the intended purpose and spirit of the ADA because on one hand The ADA has to be somewhat strict because otherwise Everyone who has a profit motive will push the line and do the minimum possible to comply with it.

298
00:19:22,066 --> 00:19:33,680
Rym: but on the other hand You basically forced a lot of free educational material that a large number of people could use that wouldn't exist Otherwise off the internet for an indefinite period because it wasn't as compliant as it could be.

299
00:19:34,451 --> 00:19:34,613
Scott: Mm-hmm.

300
00:19:35,743 --> 00:19:51,794
Rym: The twist to this is that because it was licensed mostly Creative Commons bunch of nerds Downloaded it all and are making it publicly available on another website because due to technicalities They do not have to be compliant with the ADA.

301
00:19:51,814 --> 00:19:52,397
Rym: Mm-hmm.

302
00:19:53,281 --> 00:20:01,319
Rym: So this is all a very interesting story and not being disabled and also not having Sort of like a policy expertise here.

303
00:20:01,741 --> 00:20:07,840
Rym: I'm not gonna weigh in with a very strong opinion because I have a very complex opinion and this is just a very interesting story.

304
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:23,580
Rym: I'm curious to see how this all shakes down because there's a fight like for example GeekNights if we had to make our lectures Closed captioned and someone wouldn't just do it for free Probably wouldn't put any of our lectures online because I couldn't afford to make that happen

305
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:24,401
Scott: Mm-hmm,

306
00:20:24,982 --> 00:20:30,618
Rym: but at the same time we are not a state-run institution nor are we a large for-profit institution.

307
00:20:30,638 --> 00:20:36,618
Rym: nor you know We're a small fry and this is all just very interesting and you can read these articles to find out more about it.

308
00:20:37,381 --> 00:20:39,407
Rym: Okay, you don't have any opinion on this.

309
00:20:39,427 --> 00:20:46,834
Scott: I just feel like you know, I like the ADA a lot But I feel like your solution should not be.

310
00:20:46,854 --> 00:20:50,158
Scott: you know This doesn't make you know, you're not.

311
00:20:50,178 --> 00:20:52,708
Scott: this Solution doesn't solve the problem, right?

312
00:20:52,748 --> 00:21:01,800
Scott: It doesn't make anything more accessible by removing if there's a Pizza place in town and the pizza place has stairs to get up to it, right?

313
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:11,600
Scott: It's like you can force this pizza guy to put in a ramp if he can afford it But if he can't and you force him to close all you did was make things worse for everyone.

314
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,109
Scott: You didn't make the world a better place.

315
00:21:13,129 --> 00:21:14,880
Scott: You need a different solution, right?

316
00:21:15,361 --> 00:21:18,380
Scott: You know find a way to get money for the pizza guy to build a ramp.

317
00:21:18,481 --> 00:21:21,017
Scott: Don't find a way to just shut him down if he can't build one.

318
00:21:21,037 --> 00:21:25,760
Rym: Yep Well, I think it specifically comes down to taking but also don't not do anything.

319
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:32,472
Rym: It is let a pizza guy operate with a staircase But in the case of taking existing media and making it.

320
00:21:32,693 --> 00:21:35,260
Rym: making it online as opposed to not making it online.

321
00:21:36,241 --> 00:21:46,999
Rym: You're sort of forced to not make it online if you are I guess held to the standards of the ADA because you're that kind of organization Which means you're most likely not going to make it online because you were gonna make it.

322
00:21:47,302 --> 00:21:49,600
Rym: You're only putting online because it cost you nothing to do so.

323
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:58,920
Scott: I mean, this is the another thing is, you know In general, I see a lot of people putting stuff online and then putting it online in such a way that it gets taken down.

324
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:05,380
Scott: It's like dudes just anonymously bit torrent that shit and then there's no one can take credit for it.

325
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:10,675
Scott: And I think a lot of people don't do that Specifically because they want to take credit like fansub.

326
00:22:10,715 --> 00:22:14,800
Scott: people want to take credit So they won't just put some anonymous fansub on the internet.

327
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,205
Scott: You know people make like some.

328
00:22:16,506 --> 00:22:16,686
Scott: there's.

329
00:22:16,867 --> 00:22:20,680
Scott: Nintendo has gone around hitting a lot of people who made like remakes of Nintendo games.

330
00:22:20,961 --> 00:22:22,870
Scott: There's that like 3d chrono trigger remake.

331
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:23,593
Scott: They got shut down.

332
00:22:23,613 --> 00:22:25,160
Scott: Remember that it's like dudes.

333
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:40,440
Scott: If you just didn't put your shit on a website that was identifiable and track trackable to you and just put builds up on bit Tor anonymously, there would be no one to send a takedown notice to and the whole internet could enjoy whatever awesome thing that you're making.

334
00:22:40,701 --> 00:22:45,540
Scott: It's simply your greed of wanting to take credit that is preventing this beautiful sharing of artwork.

335
00:22:46,002 --> 00:22:51,790
Scott: If I was Berkeley and I realized I mean they didn't realize it to begin with Right, I would just be like, oh, okay.

336
00:22:51,951 --> 00:22:52,955
Scott: Take it off my website.

337
00:22:52,995 --> 00:22:54,462
Scott: put it on bit torrent myself So I will.

338
00:22:54,522 --> 00:22:55,687
Scott: I will do that.

339
00:22:55,908 --> 00:22:56,450
Scott: who did that?

340
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:57,293
Scott: I don't know that one.

341
00:22:57,655 --> 00:23:04,960
Rym: It's a four terabyte archive Sure, but to most people they only know how to use YouTube to see anything.

342
00:23:05,061 --> 00:23:07,739
Rym: So putting it on bit torrent basically means no one will see it.

343
00:23:08,201 --> 00:23:11,813
Scott: You can ask me if some something is something people want now.

344
00:23:11,873 --> 00:23:12,836
Rym: people don't know why it.

345
00:23:12,876 --> 00:23:13,900
Scott: torrent is so easy.

346
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:20,304
Rym: There's so many people want to watch like their TV shows their cartoons and rather than using a bit torrent To see them legit.

347
00:23:20,545 --> 00:23:23,096
Rym: They watch those like mono audio.

348
00:23:23,137 --> 00:23:27,043
Rym: That's distorted Thing.

349
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:32,860
Scott: I've been complaining about pretty much my whole life is people would rather do hard work and get shitty results and learn something.

350
00:23:33,207 --> 00:23:33,880
Scott: It's so easy.

351
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:37,572
Scott: You literally click a link with a magnet next to it and the file downloads.

352
00:23:37,812 --> 00:23:41,384
Scott: then you double click the file and it opens in VLC it does.

353
00:23:41,424 --> 00:23:44,776
Scott: how is it really that I mean, yes, it's easier to go on YouTube.

354
00:23:44,816 --> 00:23:45,940
Scott: where you go to a website click.

355
00:23:46,482 --> 00:23:49,572
Rym: So I think it's like it's like two less steps.

356
00:23:49,612 --> 00:23:50,836
Rym: downloading is not their problem.

357
00:23:50,856 --> 00:23:51,980
Rym: they don't know how to find the stuff.

358
00:23:53,281 --> 00:23:54,366
Rym: You can't just go to pirate Bay.

359
00:23:54,386 --> 00:23:55,833
Rym: Pirate Bay is getting pretty bad.

360
00:23:56,014 --> 00:23:57,360
Scott: Pirate Bay has never failed for me.

361
00:23:58,487 --> 00:24:02,810
Rym: I can think of a lot of things pirate Bay will not have Or any torrent site that's legit.

362
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:05,140
Scott: you type in the thing you want you see a link to that thing.

363
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,495
Scott: You click it you click the thing with the magnet next to it.

364
00:24:07,556 --> 00:24:08,099
Scott: It downloads.

365
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:09,706
Rym: A lot of things are not available.

366
00:24:09,726 --> 00:24:13,500
Scott: They're just saying oh, those are things you shouldn't be watching because everything that I watch is on there.

367
00:24:13,801 --> 00:24:14,644
Rym: Okay, mr.

368
00:24:14,724 --> 00:24:19,120
Rym: Only watches Korean dramas, I don't watch any Korean drama only Korean music videos.

369
00:24:19,645 --> 00:24:26,773
Rym: Those are on YouTube for legally This library site quote until library launches to the public in April.

370
00:24:27,013 --> 00:24:29,920
Rym: The videos are only accessible to technical users via the command line.

371
00:24:31,187 --> 00:24:34,078
Rym: Okay They have a command line for this.

372
00:24:35,003 --> 00:24:37,733
Rym: Here's a guide to access library UC Berkeley.

373
00:24:37,753 --> 00:24:39,720
Rym: What do we have is if I click on this in a browser?

374
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:52,570
Rym: Yeah, the browser does not handle LBRY colon but anyway things of the day.

375
00:24:53,456 --> 00:24:57,984
Rym: so You guys know that I'm variously for whatever reason.

376
00:24:58,145 --> 00:24:59,510
Rym: I know a lot about nuclear weapons.

377
00:25:00,353 --> 00:25:03,182
Rym: So many people have been messaging me or emailing me evil.

378
00:25:03,223 --> 00:25:05,390
Rym: That's why I'm tweeting at me to tell me this exists.

379
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:08,589
Rym: Yes, I know it exists and it is now my thing of the day.

380
00:25:09,371 --> 00:25:25,130
Rym: basically, uh a whole bunch of videos of Atmospheric tests of nuclear weapons like the named ones like hardtack and The ones in the islands, yep, but mostly the ones that are on the a tolls, but also some that were in the desert.

381
00:25:26,931 --> 00:25:32,970
Rym: Videos of these have been declassified and they're all being scanned in and ultra high quality and just put on YouTube.

382
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:35,499
Scott: Well, I mean, I've already seen a whole bunch of these.

383
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:37,064
Scott: so I guess there's more that we didn't see.

384
00:25:37,305 --> 00:25:41,923
Rym: there are hundreds There are 216 tests and there are.

385
00:25:41,943 --> 00:25:48,639
Rym: I think they didn't destroy the world and they're between Thousand films of these.

386
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:51,150
Scott: Oh, cuz they're felt multiple films of each one.

387
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:55,546
Rym: Yeah, different angles close and far and also there's I mean what's to be classified?

388
00:25:55,606 --> 00:25:56,650
Scott: It's a big mushroom cloud.

389
00:25:57,491 --> 00:26:00,570
Scott: Well, so depending what can you learn from watching it?

390
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:06,387
Rym: You can learn a lot because remember atmospheric testing is banned and most nuclear testing is banned.

391
00:26:06,487 --> 00:26:06,929
Rym: actually good.

392
00:26:07,811 --> 00:26:13,932
Rym: The only way nuclear weapons can be developed is mostly by trial and error because the engineering problems are Immense.

393
00:26:13,952 --> 00:26:18,649
Scott: these videos contain like zoom in details of the bombs like insides before they like.

394
00:26:18,689 --> 00:26:29,989
Rym: now it's just a lot of stuff gets classified because While the individual data in general related nuclear weapons, the individual data are not particularly useful to making a nuclear weapon.

395
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:36,150
Rym: Correlating pieces of information from disparate sources has let people figure some shit out.

396
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:38,470
Rym: There probably should not have been figured out by those people.

397
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:43,753
Scott: I do not think that watching videos of mushroom clouds will teach you how to make So some.

398
00:26:43,834 --> 00:26:51,033
Rym: in the early days videos like this could be used to estimate yields thus estimating nuclear Capabilities.

399
00:26:51,395 --> 00:26:58,130
Rym: but in the modern era these videos are not particularly useful for that purpose So they wouldn't be wouldn't declassify them if they were useful.

400
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:07,258
Rym: Yeah, the point is they've been declassified now because in the modern era they are probably not as useful or it is now Cost effective to make them public.

401
00:27:08,522 --> 00:27:08,662
Rym: Mmm.

402
00:27:08,682 --> 00:27:15,985
Rym: So these videos are fascinating because many of them are Views of nuclear weapons that you never could have seen before.

403
00:27:16,085 --> 00:27:25,756
Rym: some of them are slow motion Video extremely slow motion of the frame by frame of the actual reaction and the plasma ball itself Mm-hmm add some scary shit.

404
00:27:25,796 --> 00:27:27,220
Rym: and these things are kind of amazing though.

405
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:37,582
Rym: A lot of the videos are just black Forever and then a white thing appears in the distance and then black again because There's a lot of videos for different purposes.

406
00:27:38,225 --> 00:27:40,935
Rym: if you're a nuclear enthusiast These are all fascinating.

407
00:27:41,437 --> 00:27:44,467
Rym: and the cool thing is if you watch a video, they're all classified.

408
00:27:44,487 --> 00:27:45,852
Rym: It's like the one on this page I'm looking at.

409
00:27:45,953 --> 00:27:47,441
Rym: is the nutmeg.

410
00:27:47,461 --> 00:27:52,977
Rym: I guess launch or the nutmeg Detonation from operation heart attack one.

411
00:27:52,997 --> 00:27:56,287
Rym: you go to Wikipedia and read exactly what the deal was with that.

412
00:27:56,327 --> 00:28:01,845
Scott: individual tests Like did they just like put these bombs down run the fuck away and then set them off?

413
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:03,250
Scott: or did they drop them from planes?

414
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,336
Scott: Or did they shoot them for summer?

415
00:28:04,417 --> 00:28:06,810
Rym: all different kinds all different guys all different kinds.

416
00:28:06,972 --> 00:28:08,548
Scott: I want to watch some of the submarine ones.

417
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:11,658
Rym: There's a famous video of a submarine launch.

418
00:28:11,698 --> 00:28:13,546
Rym: That is okay you to watch.

419
00:28:13,767 --> 00:28:15,755
Scott: they didn't The bomb part.

420
00:28:15,775 --> 00:28:17,161
Scott: I want to see how the submarine shoots it.

421
00:28:17,784 --> 00:28:18,427
Rym: Uh, those exist.

422
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:19,130
Rym: I'll send you some links.

423
00:28:19,836 --> 00:28:20,267
Rym: Those are cool.

424
00:28:20,711 --> 00:28:24,025
Scott: But though these are these are the surface and then open up a hole on top.

425
00:28:24,126 --> 00:28:26,714
Scott: or can it shoot it from when it's on From under the water.

426
00:28:26,915 --> 00:28:29,964
Scott: Yeah, so just a missile just comes out from under the water basically.

427
00:28:29,984 --> 00:28:31,408
Scott: Yeah, that's scary shit.

428
00:28:31,469 --> 00:28:31,870
Rym: Yeah it is.

429
00:28:33,791 --> 00:28:36,979
Rym: But yeah, these are videos of the explosions primarily.

430
00:28:36,999 --> 00:28:37,600
Rym: Mm-hmm.

431
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:39,305
Rym: So what you think of the day?

432
00:28:39,646 --> 00:28:44,114
Scott: So here is a video of Sam and Davis jr.

433
00:28:44,536 --> 00:28:46,121
Scott: One of the coolest people to ever live.

434
00:28:46,382 --> 00:28:48,730
Scott: Yeah, and he's in a commercial selling you something.

435
00:28:48,831 --> 00:28:56,866
Scott: the thing he is selling you is Manischewitz wine, but not just any manischewitz wine not the shit you get on Passover.

436
00:28:57,387 --> 00:29:01,594
Scott: He's selling you Almanetta Manischewitz one like almond.

437
00:29:01,835 --> 00:29:04,582
Scott: It is almond flavored manischewitz wine.

438
00:29:04,602 --> 00:29:05,705
Scott: I don't know if they still make it.

439
00:29:05,966 --> 00:29:06,247
Scott: It might.

440
00:29:06,468 --> 00:29:08,753
Rym: that sounds Horrifying.

441
00:29:08,834 --> 00:29:09,377
Scott: I don't know.

442
00:29:09,437 --> 00:29:10,483
Scott: I'm not gonna drink the shit.

443
00:29:10,543 --> 00:29:11,689
Scott: I don't have to find out.

444
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:14,020
Scott: But Sam Davis jr.

445
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:14,886
Scott: Says you should drink it.

446
00:29:14,946 --> 00:29:15,510
Scott: Maybe you should.

447
00:29:16,295 --> 00:29:16,557
Rym: All right.

448
00:29:16,577 --> 00:29:16,919
Rym: Let's see.

449
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,390
Rym: I'm looking at a wine website.

450
00:29:19,177 --> 00:29:23,528
Rym: Blah blah blah Cream almanada, I guess you can get it.

451
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:27,077
Rym: Okay, this website's bad.

452
00:29:27,097 --> 00:29:28,122
Rym: I give up.

453
00:29:28,483 --> 00:29:28,905
Rym: Okay.

454
00:29:28,925 --> 00:29:30,110
Rym: I don't want to taste this.

455
00:29:31,491 --> 00:29:33,476
Scott: Sammy says otherwise know what?

456
00:29:33,516 --> 00:29:39,882
Rym: so everywhere I click on seems to say email us and we'll tell you Look, I don't think you can get it.

457
00:29:41,632 --> 00:29:44,749
Rym: Yeah, all the all the Google I'm finding actually comes back to that.

458
00:29:44,769 --> 00:29:53,458
Scott: Sammy Definitely existed at one point when Sam Davis jr.

459
00:29:53,478 --> 00:30:00,948
Scott: Was young when Jewish wine was big with Gentiles - When you couldn't get a lot of other wine shortly after prohibition.

460
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:08,627
Rym: Many oh my god, this just the more I look at this the more terrified I am of it.

461
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:13,766
Scott: I'm sure you can get some other almond wine and to see how I like amaretto, but that's a cordial.

462
00:30:13,786 --> 00:30:14,508
Scott: It's not wine.

463
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:15,662
Rym: Yeah, it's a cordial.

464
00:30:16,971 --> 00:30:19,177
Scott: This is grapes plus almonds in the same.

465
00:30:19,197 --> 00:30:22,507
Rym: that does not feel good at best.

466
00:30:22,909 --> 00:30:25,270
Rym: at best That'll be the same as making like an oatmeal.

467
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:25,715
Scott: I mean, it's.

468
00:30:25,776 --> 00:30:33,399
Scott: I don't sure I don't drink wine But imagining having almonds on my left hand and grapes in my right hand and shove it in both of my face at the same Time and that's not the worst.

469
00:30:34,003 --> 00:30:37,032
Rym: Yeah Yeah Hmm.

470
00:30:37,454 --> 00:30:42,270
Rym: Yeah, I guess I could mix a little bit of amaretto with like a super sweet wine.

471
00:30:42,391 --> 00:30:43,919
Rym: We could try it and see what that tastes like.

472
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:49,198
Scott: I could just take my grape juice and Put some home and eat some almonds.

473
00:30:49,299 --> 00:30:54,439
Scott: You need some drink drink some grape juice while the almond Want an almond extract of some kind.

474
00:30:54,459 --> 00:30:57,630
Rym: I could give you a tincture of almond drops and get almond butter.

475
00:30:58,472 --> 00:31:00,244
Rym: I I don't think almond butter is gonna do it.

476
00:31:00,284 --> 00:31:04,950
Rym: I don't think you want to mix Butter with your beverage unless you're making a sitting bull.

477
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:09,505
Rym: I mean just like almond butter, which is a cocktail that if anyone actually orders that in a bar.

478
00:31:09,867 --> 00:31:10,750
Rym: My hat is off to you.

479
00:31:11,792 --> 00:31:13,842
Rym: Look at what a sitting bull is and you'll enjoy it.

480
00:31:13,862 --> 00:31:18,399
Scott: You're gonna get a Harvey while banger In the meta moment.

481
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,850
Rym: we were just at PAX East.

482
00:31:20,071 --> 00:31:23,190
Rym: I will try to get the video up of our panel as soon as I have a chance.

483
00:31:23,311 --> 00:31:28,198
Rym: I've been busy with a lot of other stuff and I'll be out of town this weekend So hopefully sometime by next week.

484
00:31:28,239 --> 00:31:29,022
Rym: I will get that going.

485
00:31:29,605 --> 00:31:32,022
Rym: our next con is ConnectiCon.

486
00:31:32,063 --> 00:31:37,024
Rym: maybe ConnectiCon and like July and zinc icon, I guess I'll be at that.

487
00:31:37,045 --> 00:31:44,543
Rym: you won't be at probably and Pax prime and I'll probably be at PAX Australia this year.

488
00:31:44,563 --> 00:31:46,449
Rym: That's probably gonna happen guys.

489
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:48,357
Rym: Well, so, uh people keep bugging me.

490
00:31:48,638 --> 00:31:49,441
Rym: you keep that every year.

491
00:31:49,502 --> 00:31:49,963
Rym: you guys like.

492
00:31:50,225 --> 00:31:51,449
Rym: Oh my god, you come back to PAX OS.

493
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:54,744
Rym: Pretty likely I'm coming back this year.

494
00:31:56,035 --> 00:31:56,720
Rym: You come with me.

495
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:57,809
Scott: Maybe we'll see.

496
00:31:58,852 --> 00:31:59,858
Rym: You can decide way later.

497
00:31:59,899 --> 00:32:01,770
Rym: cuz if I'm going I'm putting the panels in anyway.

498
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:05,242
Scott: I'm playing a lot of Zelda right now cuz you know, I don't play some Zelda.

499
00:32:05,442 --> 00:32:07,670
Scott: So I I set up this thing.

500
00:32:07,991 --> 00:32:08,895
Scott: It's actually pretty good.

501
00:32:08,935 --> 00:32:09,719
Scott: I highly recommend it.

502
00:32:09,739 --> 00:32:11,687
Scott: It's been working terrifically called restream.io.

503
00:32:12,932 --> 00:32:14,035
Scott: They they have a website.

504
00:32:14,055 --> 00:32:21,516
Scott: you make an account and then you stream to them with RTMP and they stream to YouTube and Twitch And maybe even other places at the same time.

505
00:32:21,596 --> 00:32:26,247
Scott: so you can watch me play Zelda either on YouTube or twitch.

506
00:32:26,448 --> 00:32:29,499
Scott: Whoa Two different channels whichever one you like better.

507
00:32:29,901 --> 00:32:32,130
Scott: You can use that and watch me play Zelda.

508
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:41,170
Scott: And if you it's better if people chat to me because then I have things to say and it won't just be me sitting there Quietly, you're not gonna be like welcome to my live stream up gamers.

509
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:42,459
Scott: No, that's not how I do.

510
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,950
Scott: But if you talk to me, I'll talk to you.

511
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:49,590
Scott: So, you know, otherwise, I'm just sitting there collecting, you know, spirit orbs and it's not exciting.

512
00:32:51,111 --> 00:32:51,856
Rym: Well, it's like if I did.

513
00:32:51,937 --> 00:32:53,850
Rym: people keep asking me do a live stream of sieve.

514
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:57,402
Rym: I don't think you understand what a live stream of me playing sieve is like.

515
00:32:57,442 --> 00:33:05,950
Rym: it's literally me staring at the screen Suddenly moving a bunch of stuff around and then going into like menus full of numbers and staring at them for like a minute.

516
00:33:06,231 --> 00:33:07,154
Scott: Yeah, this is it's.

517
00:33:07,295 --> 00:33:07,957
Scott: it's weird, right?

518
00:33:07,997 --> 00:33:11,510
Scott: I'm trying to figure out this sort of like chicken and egg problem of streaming.

519
00:33:11,671 --> 00:33:13,559
Scott: It's like the people have exciting streams.

520
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:18,017
Scott: They can do it because they have a. they're popular already They have this big old chat full of people.

521
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:26,150
Scott: and because they have a big old chat full of people they can like really get Some action going right when you play lighter games and you have banter going like all the time.

522
00:33:26,251 --> 00:33:33,289
Scott: But like if I if there's not even I don't need thousands of people I just need like, you know 20 people and like at least one or two of them.

523
00:33:33,691 --> 00:33:42,050
Scott: So at any given moment at least one or two are paying attention or saying something and then I can keep you know The talking going while the streaming is happening.

524
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:45,310
Scott: It won't just be me video of me being quiet while the game is playing.

525
00:33:45,431 --> 00:33:52,703
Rym: The other option is to do like my advanced war streams where you know enough about the game where you are Constantly talking about the game in detail.

526
00:33:52,723 --> 00:33:54,070
Scott: Yeah, I can do that.

527
00:33:54,130 --> 00:34:00,021
Scott: But the problem is is like I run out of materials like I did Faxanadu and I talked a whole bunch of the beginning of Faxanadu.

528
00:34:00,041 --> 00:34:02,150
Scott: then I ran out of material and then it got quiet.

529
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:08,629
Scott: I don't think I ever ran out of material on my old advanced war stream Zelda 1 I did a pretty good job because there was always something to say the whole time.

530
00:34:08,991 --> 00:34:13,870
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know, I say everything I know about the game and then it's just me playing the rest of it.

531
00:34:14,072 --> 00:34:18,710
Rym: I should bring those advanced war streams back anyway, I Haven't done that.

532
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,072
Rym: When did I?

533
00:34:19,092 --> 00:34:19,554
Rym: let's do that?

534
00:34:19,695 --> 00:34:20,076
Rym: That's what.

535
00:34:20,117 --> 00:34:22,184
Scott: that's some content for you while Rym is away.

536
00:34:22,224 --> 00:34:22,545
Scott: Whatever.

537
00:34:22,746 --> 00:34:24,072
Rym: Yeah, February 2015.

538
00:34:24,072 --> 00:34:29,947
Rym: Whoa, a lot of people watch that one Like way more than I thought I'm gonna be doing a lot of switch streaming.

539
00:34:30,007 --> 00:34:31,597
Scott: in general I got it all like set up.

540
00:34:31,657 --> 00:34:33,889
Scott: So it's not a lot of effort for me to just keep doing it.

541
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:37,402
Scott: So once I finish Zelda, I'll probably move on to some others these comments.

542
00:34:37,422 --> 00:34:39,110
Rym: who the hell was watching my advanced wars?

543
00:34:39,291 --> 00:34:39,773
Scott: I'm sure though.

544
00:34:39,793 --> 00:34:41,319
Scott: There's not a lot of advanced wars content.

545
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:42,303
Scott: It's people like advanced.

546
00:34:42,342 --> 00:34:42,563
Scott: Wow.

547
00:34:42,603 --> 00:34:46,775
Rym: Yeah, these comments are all like But worth nitpicking.

548
00:34:46,795 --> 00:34:49,384
Rym: you didn't move your bomber south of the AAS on that base.

549
00:34:49,404 --> 00:34:51,069
Rym: You kept attacking on this one turn.

550
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:52,793
Rym: Dude.

551
00:34:52,913 --> 00:34:57,074
Rym: okay, I'm not gonna argue with you, but maybe that was a better move I am confident.

552
00:34:57,116 --> 00:34:58,644
Rym: I made the correct decision in the street.

553
00:34:58,664 --> 00:34:59,590
Scott: You didn't even know what you did.

554
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,961
Rym: I am real fucking good at advanced war.

555
00:35:02,001 --> 00:35:02,664
Scott: How do you remember?

556
00:35:02,704 --> 00:35:03,950
Scott: Maybe that guy's the one who can beat you.

557
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:04,833
Rym: It's lands end.

558
00:35:04,954 --> 00:35:07,142
Rym: I know that map like inside and out.

559
00:35:07,323 --> 00:35:09,230
Rym: Anyway, that's the one that's shaped like Italy.

560
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,274
Scott: Let's talk about beds.

561
00:35:10,896 --> 00:35:12,903
Rym: So, uh, yeah beds.

562
00:35:13,806 --> 00:35:20,213
Rym: I've been using the same mattress for Years.

563
00:35:20,354 --> 00:35:21,739
Scott: doesn't it like get worn out?

564
00:35:21,799 --> 00:35:22,280
Scott: and me?

565
00:35:22,421 --> 00:35:23,445
Rym: it's a super.

566
00:35:23,525 --> 00:35:24,970
Rym: it's like a double pillow top.

567
00:35:25,131 --> 00:35:27,529
Rym: It's like oh, it's more than a foot thick.

568
00:35:27,791 --> 00:35:28,836
Scott: I don't like them pillow top.

569
00:35:28,957 --> 00:35:31,610
Rym: and it's on top of a box spring because it's an old-style bed.

570
00:35:31,874 --> 00:35:32,830
Rym: Oh, well, and then it's got member.

571
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:37,986
Rym: I bought the slats to replace the slats that broke because they were like a hundred years old.

572
00:35:38,006 --> 00:35:39,070
Rym: because it's an ancient bed.

573
00:35:39,295 --> 00:35:39,709
Scott: That's fine.

574
00:35:40,151 --> 00:35:47,236
Rym: So, uh, I'm thinking about getting a new mattress because I bed technology has changed a lot and the box spring is Obsolete.

575
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,730
Scott: matches are tough, right?

576
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:51,082
Scott: Cuz you know how they rip you off right and it's like you have this.

577
00:35:51,203 --> 00:35:52,390
Scott: this weird thing that goes on.

578
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:53,193
Scott: We're number one.

579
00:35:53,534 --> 00:35:55,561
Scott: you go to the mattress store, especially sleepies.

580
00:35:55,581 --> 00:35:56,102
Scott: Don't go there.

581
00:35:56,203 --> 00:35:59,455
Rym: Yeah, they're super regulated and like the mattress The industry is kind of fucked up.

582
00:35:59,997 --> 00:36:02,970
Scott: It's like they try to rip you off and charge you a fortune for this mattress.

583
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:04,489
Scott: It's not worth the fortune, right?

584
00:36:04,891 --> 00:36:10,530
Scott: But then on the other hand on the other hand a more expensive mattress is clearly superior.

585
00:36:10,731 --> 00:36:13,099
Rym: Yep, so it's like and you gotta try it out.

586
00:36:13,139 --> 00:36:14,443
Rym: You can't just buy one online cuz?

587
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,306
Rym: you don't know right?

588
00:36:15,387 --> 00:36:16,771
Scott: How do I Cuz?

589
00:36:16,851 --> 00:36:21,186
Scott: it's something like a mattress and this is this a line that mattress salesman will tell you.

590
00:36:21,246 --> 00:36:22,190
Scott: but it's also true.

591
00:36:22,876 --> 00:36:26,466
Scott: You sleep on this thing Hopefully eight hours a day, right?

592
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:33,570
Scott: Every goddamn day you use your mattress probably as much as if not more than you use your computer.

593
00:36:33,952 --> 00:36:35,802
Scott: It is one of the most important things.

594
00:36:35,842 --> 00:36:43,270
Scott: you own it also slowly Your vital juices and oils I'm saying of all the things you own you use that thing a lot.

595
00:36:43,632 --> 00:36:50,270
Rym: So getting a good one is Well case in point remember that show we did where Scott and I back and we didn't have a lot of money.

596
00:36:50,671 --> 00:36:52,519
Rym: Bought our fancy chairs, right?

597
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:57,477
Scott: Exactly, right in this chair no matter how Or you are.

598
00:36:57,517 --> 00:36:59,970
Scott: a good mattress is a good investment and that's you know.

599
00:37:00,171 --> 00:37:04,250
Scott: It's like a thing mattress salesman that are sleazy will tell you but it's also a true thing.

600
00:37:04,773 --> 00:37:06,886
Scott: But not true thing they tell you is like woo woo.

601
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:09,899
Scott: We're like this mattress will heal your energies.

602
00:37:09,959 --> 00:37:12,508
Scott: and but right it cost five hundred dollars more.

603
00:37:12,568 --> 00:37:13,150
Scott: get this one.

604
00:37:13,211 --> 00:37:14,514
Scott: Yeah, fuck you Right.

605
00:37:14,735 --> 00:37:22,468
Rym: the ancient Germans lay on the floor on beds of leaves Covered with skins or in a kind of shallow chest filled with leaves and moss.

606
00:37:22,829 --> 00:37:24,879
Rym: Sure I'm not in the Wikipedia page for bad.

607
00:37:24,919 --> 00:37:26,185
Rym: I don't know what else I'm gonna look at here.

608
00:37:26,245 --> 00:37:28,899
Scott: We're not ancient though We're modern so we don't do that.

609
00:37:29,381 --> 00:37:33,517
Rym: But yeah, so, uh I'm a rock in the queen-size bed.

610
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:36,210
Rym: I remember in RIT because you had a like a tiny bed.

611
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:37,649
Rym: Was that a single or a twin?

612
00:37:39,211 --> 00:37:40,177
Rym: Like that's how you had.

613
00:37:40,278 --> 00:37:44,930
Rym: you basically slept on a cot at RIT I mean, I just I arrived at college.

614
00:37:45,352 --> 00:37:55,470
Rym: They would go into our bedroom because one of the computers in there and they would always Always no matter what comment on the fact that I had this gigantic bed and Scott had a car in college.

615
00:37:56,277 --> 00:37:57,630
Scott: You know the fact that we're in college.

616
00:37:58,232 --> 00:38:00,500
Scott: It was unusual for you to have a gigantic bed in

617
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:11,740
Rym: our apartment was like people would look at our window and bother us sometimes Just because if you walked around colony and looked in people's windows I think we were the only apartment in the entire place that had real furniture Maybe like we had an actual couch.

618
00:38:12,021 --> 00:38:13,530
Rym: we had like a wine cabinet, right?

619
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:16,642
Scott: Yeah, it wasn't unusual for you to have a tiny bed in college.

620
00:38:16,702 --> 00:38:18,430
Scott: It was unusual for you to have a large one.

621
00:38:18,551 --> 00:38:19,655
Rym: Yeah great eyes.

622
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:26,470
Scott: as soon as he moved into colony we Went over to the furniture store and I bought the cheapest bed they had because it was a college bed.

623
00:38:26,731 --> 00:38:27,859
Rym: But it's still like my whole life.

624
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,036
Rym: as soon as I had a bedroom by myself I have always used a queen bed.

625
00:38:31,096 --> 00:38:34,088
Rym: queen bed has always been the minimum size of a bed for one.

626
00:38:35,052 --> 00:38:36,437
Rym: Mmm, I cannot I have.

627
00:38:36,577 --> 00:38:46,318
Rym: I do not like sleeping on twin beds and a single that did Might as well be a coffin Because I like to I like to.

628
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,950
Rym: I form the starfish if I'm in a bed.

629
00:38:48,131 --> 00:38:54,263
Scott: Well, there's a full-size bed, which is like it's weird Like you hardly ever see a full-size bed because but I had one.

630
00:38:54,283 --> 00:39:00,730
Scott: this is a weird size I guess bigger than twin and smaller than Queen but it's it's big enough for one person sleeping there.

631
00:39:01,011 --> 00:39:10,669
Rym: My parents when I was a kid had a king-size bed in the bedroom like big-ass bed But partly because you know adults but - we had dogs and the dogs want to sleep on the bed.

632
00:39:10,992 --> 00:39:11,822
Scott: Have you got dogs?

633
00:39:11,842 --> 00:39:12,530
Scott: You need the king-size?

634
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:15,884
Rym: Yeah, a queen-size bed plus any number of dogs not gonna work.

635
00:39:15,924 --> 00:39:17,170
Rym: I'm gonna be tiny tiny dog.

636
00:39:17,311 --> 00:39:18,721
Rym: Yeah, we never had tiny dogs.

637
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,009
Rym: We had real dogs.

638
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:23,984
Scott: The thing is, you know people make a big deal about bed size and it's like.

639
00:39:24,044 --> 00:39:36,090
Scott: clearly king-size is superior But if you're just one person as long as the bed is big enough to contain your body within its edges It's got to contain your body and your expected sprawl, right?

640
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:39,863
Rym: You know as long as it has got to be queen-size unless you sleep like a dead vampire.

641
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:45,770
Scott: No, I mean full-size is Big enough to hold an average adult person, right?

642
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:49,770
Scott: But maybe you're like fucking Andre the Giant and the king-size isn't even big enough.

643
00:39:50,131 --> 00:39:52,079
Rym: Well get a king-size sleep on it sideways.

644
00:39:52,621 --> 00:39:54,890
Scott: I'm just saying, you know, it depends on your body.

645
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:56,640
Scott: You just need a bed big enough for your body.

646
00:39:57,002 --> 00:39:58,470
Scott: What if you're a tiny person?

647
00:39:58,530 --> 00:39:59,617
Scott: You don't even need a full-size.

648
00:39:59,637 --> 00:40:01,427
Scott: You could fit in a twin size like right in the middle.

649
00:40:01,467 --> 00:40:02,852
Rym: No problem I'm pretty.

650
00:40:02,872 --> 00:40:06,990
Rym: there was a. I feel like there was a time where the double queen was in fashion.

651
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:09,615
Rym: Hey, I'm looking at bed sizes now.

652
00:40:09,956 --> 00:40:12,564
Rym: So small single or cot are all the same.

653
00:40:12,804 --> 00:40:14,710
Rym: Yeah, so that's that's even baby.

654
00:40:14,971 --> 00:40:16,637
Rym: There's single twin or bunk.

655
00:40:16,657 --> 00:40:17,339
Rym: They're all the same.

656
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:18,764
Rym: There's an extra long twin.

657
00:40:18,845 --> 00:40:20,230
Scott: I've never seen an extra long twin.

658
00:40:21,357 --> 00:40:25,700
Rym: All right, there's a Olympic queen Expanded super California.

659
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,166
Rym: What the fuck are all here?

660
00:40:27,447 --> 00:40:30,706
Scott: Here's a chart Like an aspect ratio chart.

661
00:40:30,787 --> 00:40:36,625
Scott: Yeah So California King is slightly longer and slightly less wider than a regular.

662
00:40:36,685 --> 00:40:36,765
Scott: can?

663
00:40:36,805 --> 00:40:38,430
Rym: it seems like the stupidest possible?

664
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:45,547
Scott: Unless you're really tall, I guess a king is actually not any longer than Queen.

665
00:40:45,607 --> 00:40:46,510
Scott: It's just a little bit wider.

666
00:40:46,772 --> 00:40:48,140
Rym: Yeah, that's the Queen though.

667
00:40:48,241 --> 00:40:52,382
Rym: I always thought of you know twin full Seven feet tall the king isn't long enough.

668
00:40:52,462 --> 00:40:53,709
Scott: I guess you need the California King.

669
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:56,410
Scott: I guess that extra few inches, but even that might not be long.

670
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:56,997
Rym: That's why cuz.

671
00:40:57,099 --> 00:41:03,569
Rym: in McMansions there was a time because I remember talking to real estate agents where they always talk about how this bedroom will fit a double queen.

672
00:41:03,609 --> 00:41:08,580
Rym: cuz Double queen seemed to be the thing whatever And there'd be two queen beds.

673
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:13,164
Scott: the point is as you can see on this chart This is a full-size bed is a reasonably sized bed.

674
00:41:13,185 --> 00:41:14,250
Scott: You just don't see them too often.

675
00:41:14,571 --> 00:41:17,004
Rym: Yeah, cuz but twin is way too small.

676
00:41:17,024 --> 00:41:21,441
Scott: Well, I mean if you're an adult Yeah, if you're a child and you fit on one is not a problem.

677
00:41:21,983 --> 00:41:24,918
Rym: even as a child middle school high school I had a queen-size bed.

678
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:29,136
Scott: Anyway, so Enough of that bed sizes, right?

679
00:41:29,176 --> 00:41:33,770
Scott: The point I'm gonna make is that a harder mattress is bullshit and you'll die you want.

680
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:37,216
Rym: Ideally, you want a pillow top slab.

681
00:41:37,838 --> 00:41:39,121
Rym: just sink into it.

682
00:41:39,281 --> 00:41:42,690
Scott: pillow tops are for babies and princesses who worried about peas and shit.

683
00:41:42,771 --> 00:41:44,025
Rym: I'm real worried about peas.

684
00:41:44,147 --> 00:41:46,896
Rym: now It's like my mouse right if there is.

685
00:41:47,317 --> 00:41:52,900
Rym: if there is so much as a speck of sand under my mouse pad I know I don't feel it.

686
00:41:53,001 --> 00:41:53,465
Scott: I'll feel it.

687
00:41:53,485 --> 00:41:55,913
Scott: but Bed now.

688
00:41:55,933 --> 00:41:58,504
Scott: the bed should be like a slab of granite with a sheet on it.

689
00:41:58,665 --> 00:41:59,026
Scott: So it's not.

690
00:41:59,067 --> 00:42:00,092
Rym: why don't you sleep on the Floor?

691
00:42:00,132 --> 00:42:01,001
Rym: then why don't you get a futon?

692
00:42:01,021 --> 00:42:01,748
Rym: Why even have a bed?

693
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:05,220
Rym: So the Japanese futon the problem.

694
00:42:05,521 --> 00:42:07,750
Scott: sleeping on the floor that shit is cold.

695
00:42:08,071 --> 00:42:08,874
Rym: It's not cold.

696
00:42:08,915 --> 00:42:10,200
Rym: If you're living a nice place.

697
00:42:10,501 --> 00:42:11,164
Scott: No, it's cool.

698
00:42:11,365 --> 00:42:12,329
Rym: Our floor is not cool.

699
00:42:12,489 --> 00:42:13,191
Rym: fine Then get.

700
00:42:13,352 --> 00:42:17,382
Rym: why don't you actually get like an elevated futon of some kind?

701
00:42:17,924 --> 00:42:20,350
Scott: because it's not hard and it's not the right.

702
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:20,952
Scott: It doesn't work.

703
00:42:21,213 --> 00:42:21,997
Scott: I'm just gonna get it.

704
00:42:22,017 --> 00:42:26,716
Scott: You just gotta get an extra firm mattress actual mattress But also extra firms.

705
00:42:26,757 --> 00:42:29,550
Scott: you lay on it and it moves a tiny bit.

706
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,582
Scott: So it fits the shape of your body because your body isn't flat right.

707
00:42:33,043 --> 00:42:34,730
Scott: it fits the shape of your body moving.

708
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:36,154
Rym: That's called being soft.

709
00:42:37,036 --> 00:42:42,049
Scott: It fits the shape of your body, but then Every part where it touches your body has no give.

710
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:43,915
Scott: it's like, you know, it's like.

711
00:42:43,935 --> 00:42:45,500
Scott: it's like if someone but that's not.

712
00:42:46,701 --> 00:42:47,765
Rym: That's like memory foam.

713
00:42:48,347 --> 00:42:51,960
Scott: No memory foam squishes too much right a firm mattress.

714
00:42:52,281 --> 00:42:53,125
Rym: How can it squish too much?

715
00:42:53,185 --> 00:42:54,049
Rym: once you sink into it?

716
00:42:54,229 --> 00:42:55,274
Rym: Everything has equal pressure.

717
00:42:55,314 --> 00:42:59,489
Scott: then you're all sunken in like Like an adult.

718
00:42:59,549 --> 00:43:00,253
Rym: I hate that shit.

719
00:43:00,333 --> 00:43:02,122
Scott: no sleep my side I.

720
00:43:02,182 --> 00:43:08,480
Rym: so I actually I think part of our disagreement is that I'm pretty skinny and my bony em stick way out.

721
00:43:09,905 --> 00:43:15,325
Rym: a big big chunks of my body can be described as Antlers encased in skin.

722
00:43:15,345 --> 00:43:16,227
Scott: I have that.

723
00:43:16,568 --> 00:43:21,284
Rym: Yeah, but if I sleep on my side for one my arm Will fall asleep.

724
00:43:21,525 --> 00:43:22,448
Scott: that happens to me a lot.

725
00:43:22,468 --> 00:43:24,475
Scott: Yeah, no matter what not no matter what.

726
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:29,524
Rym: but unless I twist a month or so and Also, I crush my balls.

727
00:43:30,969 --> 00:43:31,692
Scott: I don't have that problem.

728
00:43:32,133 --> 00:43:36,491
Rym: unless I put a spacer pillow between the knees I could just push my balls out front.

729
00:43:36,611 --> 00:43:38,600
Rym: Yeah, I can push them out front, but that shit ain't comfortable.

730
00:43:39,262 --> 00:43:39,965
Scott: I don't really have problems.

731
00:43:39,985 --> 00:43:42,720
Rym: I do like the hip splay, but then that's not comfortable.

732
00:43:42,821 --> 00:43:43,988
Scott: I don't really have a problem with that.

733
00:43:44,008 --> 00:43:48,966
Scott: I actually do sleep on my back Just like way back.

734
00:43:49,026 --> 00:43:51,274
Scott: are they like growing out of your taint instead of out of the front?

735
00:43:51,434 --> 00:43:55,227
Rym: they actually have a pretty sizable Roaming range.

736
00:43:55,268 --> 00:43:59,949
Scott: let's say How close are they?

737
00:44:00,029 --> 00:44:01,340
Scott: are they much closer to your asshole?

738
00:44:01,622 --> 00:44:03,194
Rym: I think no, I think they ever.

739
00:44:03,214 --> 00:44:03,980
Rym: they have quite a range.

740
00:44:04,101 --> 00:44:10,053
Rym: I think it's just that my thighs are actually really thick Really big sure like I cannot.

741
00:44:10,073 --> 00:44:13,169
Rym: if I close my legs together I will crush them right now.

742
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:19,277
Scott: so another important aspect of a bed Not just the mattress which is the most important part of the bed because it's the part that's actually functional right.

743
00:44:19,297 --> 00:44:23,098
Scott: the other parts are Just like decorations that hold the mattress up off the ground unless you have.

744
00:44:23,239 --> 00:44:24,926
Rym: so There's the difference between.

745
00:44:24,967 --> 00:44:27,679
Rym: like there's a modern beds often are much lower to the ground.

746
00:44:28,121 --> 00:44:31,040
Scott: Then older beds where I don't understand why you want a high up bed.

747
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,491
Scott: It's like what you want to climb into that shit.

748
00:44:32,632 --> 00:44:34,724
Scott: just keep it down low So it's easy to get into.

749
00:44:34,764 --> 00:44:36,733
Scott: and if higher up is warmer you want.

750
00:44:36,813 --> 00:44:38,440
Scott: by your own definition higher up is warmer.

751
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:39,563
Scott: It's barely warmer.

752
00:44:39,584 --> 00:44:41,650
Scott: Yeah, it's not warm enough to make a difference.

753
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:43,235
Scott: Your thermometer would not change.

754
00:44:43,275 --> 00:44:44,760
Rym: also being up high is kind of nice.

755
00:44:46,103 --> 00:44:53,309
Scott: No, if you're in a bunk bed you want That is at a height at which if you sit down on it It is a chair levels.

756
00:44:53,349 --> 00:44:55,179
Scott: That way it can also be used as a chair.

757
00:44:56,201 --> 00:44:57,551
Rym: Never sit on the side of your bed.

758
00:44:57,591 --> 00:44:58,940
Rym: I like to jump up into my bed.

759
00:44:59,021 --> 00:45:03,952
Scott: You can sit on the side of your bed and put your slippers on Or sit on the side of it and then swing your legs into it.

760
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:05,660
Rym: also higher a bed means storage underneath.

761
00:45:06,243 --> 00:45:09,440
Scott: I mean every bed should have a little storage underneath unless it's one of those ultra modern beds.

762
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,793
Rym: That's basically like way low to the ground making a bed.

763
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:12,920
Scott: That's literally on the ground.

764
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,485
Scott: It's just sacrificing storage space.

765
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:17,132
Rym: also super high up bed means the rabbits can't jump into it.

766
00:45:17,293 --> 00:45:17,875
Scott: Well, that's the end.

767
00:45:17,895 --> 00:45:19,239
Scott: cause trouble different problem.

768
00:45:22,424 --> 00:45:24,218
Rym: That is a very specific problem to our household.

769
00:45:26,042 --> 00:45:28,379
Rym: So yeah, Scott if you're in a bunk bed you want the upper bunk in the lower bunk.

770
00:45:29,263 --> 00:45:29,886
Scott: I don't really care.

771
00:45:30,208 --> 00:45:31,332
Rym: You really Wow, really?

772
00:45:31,594 --> 00:45:38,499
Scott: Yeah, I don't know why people care so much I mean when you're a kid the up one is so fun Right because I say you fall out of it like I did at RIT.

773
00:45:39,102 --> 00:45:43,940
Scott: Well, the point is the top part is so fun like we right until you roll out of bed.

774
00:45:44,342 --> 00:45:50,331
Scott: But the bottom part is like ah so luxurious Right, and especially the bunk beds we had when I was a kid.

775
00:45:50,572 --> 00:45:52,680
Scott: the bottom part was full and the top part was twin.

776
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,719
Scott: So it was like the bottom part was way better.

777
00:45:56,532 --> 00:46:05,820
Rym: But I do like the super soft pillow top Because I don't I just I enjoy the very calm soft comfy like sink into it very decadent feeling.

778
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:06,201
Rym: I'm very.

779
00:46:06,262 --> 00:46:07,285
Rym: that's very much my time.

780
00:46:07,305 --> 00:46:08,751
Scott: I like the hard time anyway.

781
00:46:09,513 --> 00:46:13,450
Scott: other bad aspects sheets Thread count ain't no joke.

782
00:46:13,832 --> 00:46:15,500
Rym: It's also mostly counterfeit lies.

783
00:46:15,966 --> 00:46:16,799
Scott: It's also true.

784
00:46:17,302 --> 00:46:22,220
Scott: See at the one hand you go into the store and it's like man thread count a billion and you're like what let me see.

785
00:46:22,441 --> 00:46:25,031
Scott: And it's actually thread count like a hundred and like this.

786
00:46:25,071 --> 00:46:26,356
Scott: shit is like fucking sandpaper.

787
00:46:26,396 --> 00:46:27,300
Scott: fuck that shit, right?

788
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,460
Scott: It is lying to you, you know.

789
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:36,689
Scott: But if you do actually get the high thread count biz like silk or like whoa It feels so good.

790
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:37,900
Scott: You lay down into it like whoa.

791
00:46:40,021 --> 00:46:51,399
Rym: But I find that the sheets themselves don't matter as much as what kinds of blankets you put over them because if you have A blanket that is a little more airy It'll make even crappy sheets feel way better.

792
00:46:51,841 --> 00:46:52,925
Rym: Well, let's just do coal.

793
00:46:52,945 --> 00:46:53,086
Rym: see.

794
00:46:53,106 --> 00:46:56,440
Scott: the sheets are about the texture of the material touching your skin.

795
00:46:56,541 --> 00:46:57,608
Scott: That's what the sheets are about.

796
00:46:57,668 --> 00:47:02,369
Scott: the blankets just go on top of the sheets And keep you warm as long as they got.

797
00:47:02,409 --> 00:47:07,572
Rym: so usually the blanket is the base layer for base warmth And then that comforters are actually keeping you warm.

798
00:47:07,612 --> 00:47:11,580
Scott: However, I Like the sheet is the part that touches your skin.

799
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:14,132
Scott: So the textures of the other parts don't matter.

800
00:47:14,212 --> 00:47:15,800
Scott: only their insulation properties matter.

801
00:47:16,221 --> 00:47:21,637
Rym: But if they're if they're insulating but also have a little bit more air give like the whole air is insulating.

802
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:23,765
Scott: That's what the air is for.

803
00:47:24,086 --> 00:47:24,849
Rym: It depends.

804
00:47:24,869 --> 00:47:25,954
Rym: So it's like technical fabrics.

805
00:47:25,974 --> 00:47:27,440
Rym: You could have things that will insulate it.

806
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:30,068
Rym: Do you know by unidirectional blankets?

807
00:47:30,329 --> 00:47:33,700
Rym: Yeah, actually that might be pretty good tactical blank tactical blankets.

808
00:47:35,952 --> 00:47:40,035
Rym: but I Don't like comforters and I would never own one because my.

809
00:47:40,416 --> 00:47:40,978
Scott: what are you doing?

810
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:42,759
Scott: What do you wear in the?

811
00:47:44,128 --> 00:48:02,800
Rym: What I'm getting to is my entire life I have only ever ever lived in places with the exception of colony Manor at RIT Where the HVAC systems were such that there were not drafts and the house was always Pretty much everywhere a very nice temperature to where a comforter was literally never ever ever needed ever.

812
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,372
Scott: So you just heat your whole house with fire and then not use blankets.

813
00:48:06,773 --> 00:48:07,656
Rym: No, I'd use blankets.

814
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:08,740
Rym: I would not use comforters.

815
00:48:08,841 --> 00:48:20,535
Rym: I would always have a sheet and then a reasonable medium or thin blanket Depending if it's summer or winter and never have a comforter Because the comforter would always be way too hot because the house is always like 76 degrees.

816
00:48:24,434 --> 00:48:27,589
Rym: So This apartment.

817
00:48:27,609 --> 00:48:28,900
Rym: we're in New York, right?

818
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:32,480
Rym: The other thing about no control over your heat your apartments always like a million degrees.

819
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:34,409
Scott: The other thing about do you have a comforter?

820
00:48:34,569 --> 00:48:35,614
Rym: Yeah, you use it.

821
00:48:35,775 --> 00:48:38,899
Rym: Yeah, I'm using it right now While your apartment's way too hot for that.

822
00:48:39,462 --> 00:48:40,646
Scott: That's the thing about a comforter.

823
00:48:40,766 --> 00:48:44,580
Scott: is that even in the summer you get under the comforter and it feels great.

824
00:48:44,821 --> 00:48:45,403
Scott: It feels great.

825
00:48:45,443 --> 00:48:46,306
Rym: No matter what too hot.

826
00:48:46,346 --> 00:48:46,848
Rym: You'll sweat.

827
00:48:47,028 --> 00:48:47,430
Scott: It's it's.

828
00:48:47,771 --> 00:48:50,380
Scott: it's temperature regulating magic of the comforter, right?

829
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:50,882
Scott: Is that like?

830
00:48:51,184 --> 00:48:52,691
Rym: what kind of cover do you have?

831
00:48:52,731 --> 00:48:54,479
Rym: This temperature regulating comforters are just too much.

832
00:48:54,861 --> 00:48:56,790
Scott: No, you get under it and you always feel great.

833
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:58,840
Scott: It doesn't matter what the temperature is outside.

834
00:48:59,021 --> 00:49:00,648
Rym: I'm gonna get under your comforter.

835
00:49:00,689 --> 00:49:01,352
Rym: It'll be too hot.

836
00:49:01,653 --> 00:49:02,658
Scott: There's no such thing as too hot.

837
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:07,520
Rym: There you you were just implying that keeping my house at 76 degrees was too hot.

838
00:49:07,902 --> 00:49:10,720
Scott: No, I said is a waste of energy when you just get under the blanket.

839
00:49:10,804 --> 00:49:11,060
Scott: Let's see.

840
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:16,599
Rym: However, it was not much of a waste of energy because I've also always lived in super fucking insulated houses.

841
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:21,874
Scott: Anyway, modern like it's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.

842
00:49:22,135 --> 00:49:23,980
Scott: you put a blanket people even in fact.

843
00:49:24,121 --> 00:49:26,460
Rym: Actually now they live in your days in New York.

844
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:29,613
Rym: The problem is stuff stays too warm because a lot of people have control over the heat.

845
00:49:29,834 --> 00:49:33,808
Scott: even in the days when people had Fireplaces in their bedrooms they still had blank.

846
00:49:34,009 --> 00:49:37,881
Rym: because fireplace in the bedroom means you live in a drafty ass piece of shit pre-world War.

847
00:49:38,021 --> 00:49:40,869
Scott: one house fireplace in the bedroom is way warm.

848
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:43,195
Rym: Yes one till you burn your house down to.

849
00:49:43,436 --> 00:49:44,820
Rym: fireplaces are way too warm.

850
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:54,200
Rym: I lived in a house for a while when I was in Poughkeepsie that was heated primarily by Fireplaces, let me tell you it was way too.

851
00:49:54,561 --> 00:49:58,716
Rym: I slept naked on the top of my bed because that that thing had two settings.

852
00:49:58,836 --> 00:50:01,204
Rym: no the Sun and Nothing.

853
00:50:01,346 --> 00:50:04,702
Scott: no such thing is too warm It's cold.

854
00:50:04,783 --> 00:50:08,255
Rym: You gotta get warm, but I actually prefer these days to have just a sheet and no blanket.

855
00:50:08,335 --> 00:50:15,373
Rym: pretty much ever even in hotels In the summer, yeah, even in the winter cuz that's just so airy and the hotel.

856
00:50:15,393 --> 00:50:17,420
Rym: you want to turn off that AC?

857
00:50:19,422 --> 00:50:22,259
Scott: Yeah, I mean in the summer yeah just a sheet.

858
00:50:22,279 --> 00:50:25,840
Rym: I Feel like we should skip pillows cuz that could be a whole show in and of itself.

859
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,605
Rym: Pillows could be a whole show.

860
00:50:28,685 --> 00:50:29,930
Scott: I switched to the Z pillow.

861
00:50:29,970 --> 00:50:30,752
Scott: It's been working out.

862
00:50:30,833 --> 00:50:32,940
Rym: Yeah, I bought the highest rated.

863
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,408
Scott: See memory foam is bullshit.

864
00:50:35,428 --> 00:50:36,393
Scott: I don't like no memory foam.

865
00:50:36,514 --> 00:50:37,640
Rym: I got you should try my pillow.

866
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:39,607
Rym: It's the highest rated pillow on Amazon.

867
00:50:39,667 --> 00:50:41,313
Scott: No mine is the highest rate pill on Amazon.

868
00:50:41,333 --> 00:50:42,818
Rym: is that your mind is eyes memory phone?

869
00:50:43,581 --> 00:50:45,429
Scott: It's silicone type stuff.

870
00:50:45,790 --> 00:50:48,020
Scott: It's pillow shaped not like a weird blob.

871
00:50:48,241 --> 00:50:51,038
Rym: I want the hump and then bigger hump.

872
00:50:51,179 --> 00:50:54,871
Rym: now I need neck support cuz I sleep on my back.

873
00:50:54,991 --> 00:50:57,137
Scott: the Z pillow has neck support.

874
00:50:57,338 --> 00:50:59,043
Scott: the way it works Is that it is.

875
00:50:59,224 --> 00:51:04,300
Scott: even though it is normal pillow shape the middle area is has more bigger holes in it and is less dense.

876
00:51:04,643 --> 00:51:07,828
Scott: So it squishes more than the part Normal pillow.

877
00:51:07,848 --> 00:51:08,372
Rym: that's bullshit.

878
00:51:08,452 --> 00:51:13,768
Scott: It is shaped like a normal pillow But when you put your head on it The middle part goes in more than the edge part.

879
00:51:13,788 --> 00:51:16,215
Rym: you find the pillow that I bought some bullshit.

880
00:51:16,255 --> 00:51:24,780
Rym: memory foam memory foams garbage Foam is great except while you're so people who say they have memory foam have some bootleg crab That smells like the inside of a factory from China.

881
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:28,420
Scott: You know, you scrolled a lot way down this page for the highest rated pillow.

882
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:28,741
Scott: It shouldn't?

883
00:51:28,761 --> 00:51:30,248
Rym: it's sorted by irrelevance not high.

884
00:51:30,308 --> 00:51:31,674
Scott: It may be the first one.

885
00:51:31,875 --> 00:51:32,920
Rym: average customer review.

886
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:33,622
Rym: Let's see.

887
00:51:34,143 --> 00:51:36,129
Scott: Is it the first one that black thing?

888
00:51:36,369 --> 00:51:38,114
Rym: It's that weird blousey.

889
00:51:38,736 --> 00:51:39,979
Scott: It's not that weird black thing.

890
00:51:40,019 --> 00:51:42,446
Rym: I'm guess No, it's not looking for it.

891
00:51:42,466 --> 00:51:44,010
Rym: I bought this pillow like three years ago.

892
00:51:44,151 --> 00:51:45,154
Rym: So, uh-huh.

893
00:51:45,354 --> 00:51:47,380
Scott: What if Z pillows where it's at?

894
00:51:48,683 --> 00:51:49,326
Rym: Only on the top?

895
00:51:49,426 --> 00:51:49,948
Scott: that's bullshit.

896
00:51:50,009 --> 00:51:51,816
Rym: Also doesn't need cold pillow.

897
00:51:51,917 --> 00:51:52,620
Rym: It looks more like this.

898
00:51:52,833 --> 00:51:53,603
Rym: Yeah This pillow.

899
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:59,802
Rym: the selling point was that the core is like a heat sink almost So it always feels cool no matter what.

900
00:51:59,922 --> 00:52:06,605
Scott: that is what the Z pillows all about has the holes in it and those holes make it always nice and cold and You get your pillowcase on.

901
00:52:06,625 --> 00:52:09,520
Rym: there is you know, it's not this pillow, but it kind of looks like this pillow.

902
00:52:09,782 --> 00:52:10,550
Scott: It's weird, right?

903
00:52:10,590 --> 00:52:11,620
Scott: You can never be too warm.

904
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:17,290
Scott: But for some reason I'm all about the cold pillow and when one part of the pillow warms up I move my head to a different part of the pillow.

905
00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:17,813
Scott: That's warm.

906
00:52:17,833 --> 00:52:20,985
Scott: I mean, it's cold and I got.

907
00:52:21,046 --> 00:52:21,950
Rym: I got these sleep.

908
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:23,536
Rym: Oh, it's lost of stars since I bought it.

909
00:52:23,637 --> 00:52:24,380
Scott: Yeah, it's some garbage.

910
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:25,143
Rym: Oh, I bought it in 2014.

911
00:52:25,143 --> 00:52:26,911
Rym: All right, that's some bull three years ago.

912
00:52:27,192 --> 00:52:27,654
Rym: So look at this.

913
00:52:27,694 --> 00:52:28,920
Rym: See it's nice shape.

914
00:52:29,486 --> 00:52:30,359
Scott: Yeah, it's a piece of shit.

915
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:41,394
Rym: It's this is the best fucking pillow and I have lent this pillow to friends who stay over because all my other normal pillows I actually have bird feathers in them because they're like fancy down pillows.

916
00:52:41,956 --> 00:52:46,700
Rym: down pillows are real comfortable But uh, if you're allergic to chickens, that's bad news.

917
00:52:47,322 --> 00:52:54,971
Scott: the only problem I have with feather pillows is that when the feather bottom parts poke out and stab you a Well-designed down pillow will not have that problem.

918
00:52:55,091 --> 00:52:56,818
Scott: pillows on my couch have that problem.

919
00:52:57,019 --> 00:53:00,168
Rym: Yep This pillow is the best pillow.

920
00:53:00,208 --> 00:53:01,271
Rym: It's so garbage.

921
00:53:01,472 --> 00:53:04,440
Rym: It's so cool on your skin garbage.

922
00:53:04,942 --> 00:53:06,067
Rym: Wonder why it got low rate?

923
00:53:06,087 --> 00:53:09,160
Rym: because you used to have five stars because people wise up and got the Z pillow.

924
00:53:09,401 --> 00:53:10,204
Rym: I think I got the Queen.

925
00:53:10,365 --> 00:53:11,931
Scott: one realized memory foam is bullshit.

926
00:53:12,473 --> 00:53:13,076
Rym: All right, let's see.

927
00:53:13,116 --> 00:53:14,100
Rym: Let me look at these reviews.

928
00:53:14,522 --> 00:53:14,743
Rym: Let's see.

929
00:53:14,763 --> 00:53:16,953
Rym: what people say is I have a blah blah blah.

930
00:53:17,174 --> 00:53:18,380
Rym: I want to see the one star reviews.

931
00:53:20,581 --> 00:53:21,867
Scott: They're always gonna say something stupid.

932
00:53:21,968 --> 00:53:24,500
Rym: a few things went terribly wrong with this pillow.

933
00:53:24,982 --> 00:53:27,571
Rym: Oh the pillow I got was not the one it's okay.

934
00:53:27,611 --> 00:53:30,040
Rym: So this guy got ripped off and got a bootleg pillow.

935
00:53:31,702 --> 00:53:32,385
Rym: This pillow sucks.

936
00:53:32,425 --> 00:53:33,248
Rym: no support at all.

937
00:53:33,831 --> 00:53:34,534
Rym: What's wrong with you?

938
00:53:34,574 --> 00:53:35,940
Scott: It's like it must have a giant head.

939
00:53:36,241 --> 00:53:37,365
Rym: It was hard to sleep on.

940
00:53:37,485 --> 00:53:39,171
Scott: okay, dude, maybe you had it upside down.

941
00:53:39,612 --> 00:53:40,475
Rym: they smell horrible.

942
00:53:40,556 --> 00:53:41,820
Rym: No, you got a bootleg.

943
00:53:43,082 --> 00:53:44,230
Rym: I'm not happy with this pillow.

944
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:45,660
Rym: I got it help cooling my head at night.

945
00:53:46,601 --> 00:53:47,223
Rym: Bad smell.

946
00:53:47,283 --> 00:53:48,567
Rym: No bad smell.

947
00:53:48,627 --> 00:53:50,032
Rym: No, it was so hard.

948
00:53:50,072 --> 00:53:51,195
Rym: This pill is not hard at all.

949
00:53:51,215 --> 00:53:53,439
Rym: I Think these people are all day.

950
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:58,879
Rym: This is like so when we were in on the ski trip right sound like a game developer reading their own steam reviews.

951
00:53:58,979 --> 00:54:02,540
Rym: Yeah When we were in on the ski trip, right?

952
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:10,190
Rym: I was looking at reviews because there aren't that many restaurants out in the boonies and there's this Mexican place and Most of the reviews were like this food is garbage.

953
00:54:10,471 --> 00:54:11,215
Rym: It'll make you sick.

954
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:12,159
Rym: Fuck this place.

955
00:54:12,902 --> 00:54:13,023
Rym: Like.

956
00:54:13,043 --> 00:54:14,148
Rym: the reviews were real bad.

957
00:54:14,188 --> 00:54:17,160
Rym: The place had like three stars total, maybe two and a half.

958
00:54:17,641 --> 00:54:23,639
Rym: There was one review and all it said was two words all lowercase run away.

959
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,926
Scott: But best review ever.

960
00:54:27,067 --> 00:54:28,772
Scott: it still gave it three stars.

961
00:54:29,133 --> 00:54:31,039
Scott: Well three stars run away.

962
00:54:34,261 --> 00:54:36,919
Scott: I Never seen my run away be one star.

963
00:54:37,241 --> 00:54:43,760
Rym: I really want to know what the story is there to where it still got the extra star Two star bonus for runaway.

964
00:54:47,061 --> 00:54:54,850
Rym: But I'm thinking about buying a new bed because that mattress is accumulated 16 to 20 years of my.

965
00:54:54,890 --> 00:54:56,496
Scott: yeah, that's about the lifetime for a mattress.

966
00:54:56,717 --> 00:55:01,420
Rym: Yeah, actually I've been told by people are trying to sell me mattresses that every five years you buy a new one.

967
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:02,947
Scott: That's people trying to sell you mattresses.

968
00:55:03,128 --> 00:55:03,690
Rym: See how I'm gonna.

969
00:55:03,731 --> 00:55:05,619
Rym: I'm gonna Google right now also often.

970
00:55:10,281 --> 00:55:13,591
Rym: I type how often and the first Google representations.

971
00:55:13,671 --> 00:55:14,373
Rym: Should you poop?

972
00:55:14,714 --> 00:55:15,576
Rym: Should you shower?

973
00:55:15,837 --> 00:55:16,780
Rym: Should you wash your hair?

974
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:18,028
Rym: Should you change your sheets?

975
00:55:18,533 --> 00:55:21,946
Scott: Okay I don't change my shoes enough.

976
00:55:22,428 --> 00:55:25,197
Rym: I do not change mine enough either, but I'm trying to change it more often.

977
00:55:25,758 --> 00:55:29,228
Rym: your Mattress that's actually one of the recommendations here.

978
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:32,580
Rym: five to seven years according to the National Sleep Foundation.

979
00:55:32,861 --> 00:55:37,173
Scott: The National Sleep Foundation is an organization that is trying to sell more mattresses.

980
00:55:37,614 --> 00:55:39,600
Scott: My mattress is already like eight years old.

981
00:55:39,821 --> 00:55:44,980
Rym: I'm not buying a new one for consumer reports, which is also kind of a scam and not as much consumer reports.

982
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,669
Scott: Hey, you're mostly legit ten years.

983
00:55:46,689 --> 00:55:48,940
Scott: All right, so I plan to buy a new mattress in three years.

984
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:49,984
Scott: There's nothing wrong with the mattress.

985
00:55:50,025 --> 00:55:53,580
Scott: I am mine is just so old that I bought it when I moved to New York.

986
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:58,460
Rym: Oh, no, and it's probably gained ten pounds from the oily secretions of my body over the last.

987
00:55:58,460 --> 00:55:59,325
Scott: Oh, that's something else.

988
00:55:59,627 --> 00:56:03,839
Scott: A lot of people don't have these but I highly recommend the mattress pad.

989
00:56:04,761 --> 00:56:05,524
Rym: Mattress pads.

990
00:56:06,168 --> 00:56:08,660
Rym: I have felt like are obsolete and black.

991
00:56:08,981 --> 00:56:10,930
Rym: So the mattress pad is pads always.

992
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:11,995
Rym: you know what I used to use them for.

993
00:56:12,015 --> 00:56:14,888
Rym: if you have a shitty mattress It makes the mattress more comfortable.

994
00:56:14,929 --> 00:56:17,240
Scott: No, so you're looking for that pillow top action, right?

995
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:21,160
Scott: I mattress pad I have does not provide any pillowy top.

996
00:56:21,702 --> 00:56:24,212
Scott: It is merely sort of like a mattress protector.

997
00:56:24,273 --> 00:56:33,559
Scott: in a way you put it over the mattress Then you put your sheets on and that way your oily secretions go into the mattress pad Which you can replace and your mattress is still beautiful to new always

998
00:56:34,102 --> 00:56:35,287
Rym: But I feel like that's what

999
00:56:35,347 --> 00:56:36,713
Scott: it's for

1000
00:56:36,974 --> 00:56:41,576
Rym: and make the mattress worse In terms of airiness because I actually part of what

1001
00:56:41,597 --> 00:56:43,002
Scott: I'm mine Do not affect.

1002
00:56:43,043 --> 00:56:46,853
Scott: the one I have is does not affect the feel of the mattress in any way.

1003
00:56:46,873 --> 00:56:59,440
Scott: All right, it is simply a Absorbing oiliness protector to keep the mattress itself You know relatively clean because it's easy to clean and take a mattress pad and throw it in the washing machine.

1004
00:57:00,122 --> 00:57:05,100
Scott: It's not easy to throw a mattress in the washing machine and the sheet is not enough to protect the mattress from your body.

1005
00:57:05,341 --> 00:57:07,309
Rym: Yeah, definitely not the sheets themselves.

1006
00:57:07,349 --> 00:57:08,996
Scott: You'll see that you need that extra layer.

1007
00:57:09,016 --> 00:57:13,114
Scott: So My mattress pad is all like yellow from skin oils.

1008
00:57:13,275 --> 00:57:14,199
Rym: Yeah, my mattress is all.

1009
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:16,043
Scott: yeah It's supposed to be.

1010
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:21,200
Scott: I should probably actually replace the mattress pad because even after washing it it's still yellow with skin oils.

1011
00:57:21,441 --> 00:57:22,446
Rym: But yeah, I'm thinking about dishes.

1012
00:57:22,466 --> 00:57:28,707
Rym: So actually if anyone wants an antique like Fancy rosewood bed.

1013
00:57:28,727 --> 00:57:31,276
Scott: I mean a bed the bed part is a bed, right?

1014
00:57:31,296 --> 00:57:34,740
Scott: It doesn't even fucking matter It's just if I get a modern bed.

1015
00:57:34,961 --> 00:57:37,834
Scott: All the bed does is hold the mattress off the.

1016
00:57:37,874 --> 00:57:47,420
Rym: if I get a modern mattress I want to get a modern bed frame because this is a classic old-style bed frame meaning It's two pieces of wood on the side a headboard a footboard and you put slats.

1017
00:57:47,501 --> 00:57:48,612
Scott: What do you think a modern bed is?

1018
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:54,360
Scott: It's some sort of square structure that you know has slats and elevates a mattress off the ground.

1019
00:57:54,561 --> 00:57:55,986
Rym: Often modern ones don't have slats.

1020
00:57:56,006 --> 00:57:59,940
Rym: They just have a pad like a plate like a pad or rails to put the thing on.

1021
00:58:00,164 --> 00:58:00,799
Scott: It's all the same.

1022
00:58:00,901 --> 00:58:11,379
Rym: It's some sort of platform that is Have built-in storage and stuff in a way that I don't want to just like slide shit under the bed Sure, but that those aren't related to the bed part.

1023
00:58:13,622 --> 00:58:20,492
Rym: So if anybody I don't want to put a modern mattress on this Current bed frame because it's an ancient as bed frame doesn't matter.

1024
00:58:20,532 --> 00:58:22,820
Scott: It'll the mattress is the part you sleep on.

1025
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:25,040
Scott: It'll feel the same no matter what frame is elevated.

1026
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:28,740
Rym: Yeah, but a lot of the modern mattresses I want this one because it has the slats.

1027
00:58:29,122 --> 00:58:32,680
Rym: I'd have to have a box spring or something under the mattress.

1028
00:58:32,921 --> 00:58:34,325
Rym: I just have a modern.

1029
00:58:34,345 --> 00:58:40,557
Scott: my IKEA bed had came with slats and I just put a big flat piece of wood over the slats And then put the mattress on top of that.

1030
00:58:42,581 --> 00:58:43,848
Rym: And it's what kind of matches do you have?

1031
00:58:44,391 --> 00:58:44,954
Scott: I don't even know.

1032
00:58:44,974 --> 00:58:45,980
Rym: no box spring though?

1033
00:58:46,181 --> 00:58:48,360
Rym: No, I do feel like box springs are obsolete.

1034
00:58:49,282 --> 00:58:52,506
Scott: You need a box spring depending on the kind of frame I don't know.

1035
00:58:52,689 --> 00:58:55,325
Rym: or if you got an old Usually use the box spring.

1036
00:58:55,365 --> 00:59:05,979
Scott: if the kind of frame you have is the kind is just like a metal rectangle with wheels under it And then you put the box spring on that and the box spring basically is the platform that the magic can go on.

1037
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:09,715
Rym: here We go types of frames platform frame which is used without box frames.

1038
00:59:09,896 --> 00:59:10,760
Rym: That's the modern ones.

1039
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:11,884
Rym: That's the one I'm looking at getting.

1040
00:59:12,326 --> 00:59:14,094
Rym: captain has drawers beneath the frame.

1041
00:59:14,194 --> 00:59:15,500
Scott: I guess that's what I had when I was a kid.

1042
00:59:16,203 --> 00:59:17,288
Rym: Oh water beds.

1043
00:59:17,549 --> 00:59:19,518
Rym: water beds were real big in the 80s water beds.

1044
00:59:19,558 --> 00:59:20,843
Scott: There's a kid I knew who had one.

1045
00:59:20,883 --> 00:59:23,010
Scott: it was really cool and fun, but I don't

1046
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:24,034
Rym: know

1047
00:59:24,495 --> 00:59:27,548
Scott: if it's a good idea to actually Sleep on one every night the

1048
00:59:27,628 --> 00:59:27,890
Rym: ones that

1049
00:59:27,910 --> 00:59:36,199
Scott: was like this thing where you see one or you're laying one And it's so cool and so awesome, and then if you actually do it every day, and that's like your main bed I think it's bad.

1050
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:40,780
Rym: They're not actually that comfortable if they have baffles to prevent them from sloshing.

1051
00:59:41,203 --> 00:59:44,020
Rym: Then you lose a lot of the aspects of it being a water bed.

1052
00:59:44,281 --> 00:59:47,675
Rym: But if you don't have those baffles every time you move it'll make waves also.

1053
00:59:47,715 --> 00:59:48,940
Scott: What if it lock leaks?

1054
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:49,884
Rym: Yeah, that happens.

1055
00:59:49,964 --> 00:59:50,286
Rym: Also.

1056
00:59:50,306 --> 00:59:52,440
Rym: They're so heavy that they will break your floor.

1057
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:55,207
Rym: true and there's.

1058
00:59:55,288 --> 00:59:58,877
Rym: they're probably full of bacteria and nasty as water in there.

1059
00:59:59,018 --> 01:00:02,435
Rym: well I mean sealed system, so it doesn't matter a lot of leases in New York.

1060
01:00:02,656 --> 01:00:03,480
Rym: ban water beds.

1061
01:00:03,982 --> 01:00:06,631
Scott: Yes, cuz you'll flood your fucking neighbors if it's not happens.

1062
01:00:06,672 --> 01:00:07,213
Rym: Don't go also.

1063
01:00:07,234 --> 01:00:07,836
Rym: They're too heavy.

1064
01:00:08,257 --> 01:00:08,940
Scott: That's also bad.

1065
01:00:09,901 --> 01:00:11,167
Rym: Yeah, everything on water beds is bad.

1066
01:00:11,207 --> 01:00:13,557
Rym: I feel like they were a trend in the 80s, then they just died.

1067
01:00:13,939 --> 01:00:20,240
Rym: yep So the modern version painted 1971 Popular in the 80s and 90s and now they're basically dead.

1068
01:00:20,601 --> 01:00:28,705
Scott: I feel like you can make a water bed like a new design out of something like you know more modern Material that doesn't just have one big blob of water But has lots of little.

1069
01:00:28,805 --> 01:00:30,772
Rym: that's what a lot of the ones in the 90s did.

1070
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:36,556
Scott: they had various baffles or like some pone in Some water chamber, oh, but it's like you could just use air instead.

1071
01:00:36,697 --> 01:00:37,260
Scott: air is fine.

1072
01:00:37,701 --> 01:00:38,962
Rym: Oh, they also had to be heated.

1073
01:00:39,723 --> 01:00:40,764
Rym: you had to heat that crap.

1074
01:00:40,884 --> 01:00:41,465
Scott: That's not good.

1075
01:00:43,868 --> 01:00:44,148
Rym: Wow.

1076
01:00:44,208 --> 01:00:45,370
Rym: Yeah, there are a lot.

1077
01:00:45,991 --> 01:00:47,638
Rym: Okay, there's a whole article on water beds.

1078
01:00:47,658 --> 01:00:48,904
Rym: another a bad news bear.

1079
01:00:49,004 --> 01:00:50,810
Scott: yeah air mattress is fine You don't need a water.

1080
01:00:50,910 --> 01:00:59,189
Rym: Only good thing for air mat for water beds is when you were a kid in the 80s and 90s You'd have regular trips to the mall with your family's lived in the burbs and think you did Rookstone would have it.

1081
01:00:59,390 --> 01:01:04,812
Rym: You'd you go into the department store because you always went into the department store because there's something your family always had to buy In there.

1082
01:01:04,832 --> 01:01:07,727
Rym: and what I would do me and my brother is we run off from her parents.

1083
01:01:08,069 --> 01:01:09,229
Rym: every time There's a bed on display.

1084
01:01:09,652 --> 01:01:17,125
Rym: We'd run at it and jump on it to see if it was a water bed Because maybe one in ten was totally a water bed back then also.

1085
01:01:17,325 --> 01:01:25,597
Scott: There's also those beds that like Like the motor to recline and change whatever Used to see those on TV commercials.

1086
01:01:25,797 --> 01:01:28,025
Rym: you still see those on TV commercials if you watch TV.

1087
01:01:28,045 --> 01:01:29,370
Rym: those are for old people or injured.

1088
01:01:30,072 --> 01:01:35,470
Rym: Yeah, I don't like technology beds because I feel like like a bed with a massage or a heater inside.

1089
01:01:35,591 --> 01:01:39,750
Rym: I feel like those are all just cheap crap that are gonna break or aren't actually that pleasant?

1090
01:01:40,222 --> 01:01:42,076
Scott: Yeah There hasn't been one yet.

1091
01:01:42,116 --> 01:01:45,328
Scott: if there was one that was so good it would become the new standard for beds everywhere.

1092
01:01:45,348 --> 01:01:48,950
Rym: unless I were Bedridden or old I would never want a bed that does that reclining nonsense.

1093
01:01:49,311 --> 01:01:50,816
