00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,998
Rym: I'd like to drink myself in velour.

27
00:01:07,705 --> 00:01:13,272
Rym: anyway in the news, uh I hope you voted and you're probably thinking wait didn't?

28
00:01:13,734 --> 00:01:15,560
Scott: I guess if you live in New York State?

29
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,457
Rym: We had our primary and Emily and I went in.

30
00:01:19,262 --> 00:01:20,125
Rym: so the saddest thing.

31
00:01:20,145 --> 00:01:23,458
Rym: we went to vote in the primary and one no one's there dot.

32
00:01:23,558 --> 00:01:31,626
Rym: there were ten poll workers there and they were all So Excited that someone showed up.

33
00:01:31,988 --> 00:01:32,249
Rym: Yeah.

34
00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:33,373
Rym: Yeah that we were there.

35
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:38,276
Rym: Well, I had a tab playing in the background and So happy that we were there voting.

36
00:01:38,296 --> 00:01:38,679
Rym: Mm-hmm.

37
00:01:39,222 --> 00:01:46,371
Rym: So the two choices we had where we had to vote in the mayoral primary for the Democrats Which that's actually you're voting for mayor.

38
00:01:46,411 --> 00:01:48,520
Scott: Basically, that's yeah, that's the mayoral election.

39
00:01:48,821 --> 00:01:53,519
Rym: I don't care if you want to say you're an independent because the Democrats are more centrist than you'd like.

40
00:01:53,559 --> 00:01:53,780
Rym: like that.

41
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:55,027
Rym: I can understand that.

42
00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:04,904
Rym: but if you live in a place like New York The Democratic primaries are the elections for literally everything because Republicans they win in shit Some districts.

43
00:02:04,984 --> 00:02:08,195
Scott: but yeah where you live you that was pretty much that was the vote.

44
00:02:08,275 --> 00:02:09,759
Scott: the people you voted for are the winners.

45
00:02:10,362 --> 00:02:19,140
Scott: Yeah, and you might think oh, well, you know, it's just it's already decided but it's like no It's not looking like some of the percentages.

46
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:23,140
Scott: It's not like, you know, one person is a hundred percent and everyone else has one.

47
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:27,580
Scott: It's like you'll see like Oh de Blasio had like 70 or 80.

48
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:31,633
Rym: Imagine that like 11 people voted in that to have primary.

49
00:02:32,014 --> 00:02:32,175
Rym: No.

50
00:02:32,215 --> 00:02:35,605
Scott: No, it gets down to two digits past the decimal point.

51
00:02:35,645 --> 00:02:35,746
Scott: the

52
00:02:35,766 --> 00:02:51,734
Rym: biggest danger is like in the Democratic primaries in New York, you'll see like one normal liberal I'm not a crackpot liberal and then a bunch of fake liberals are actually really conservative or religious or weird And you can't risk one of them win in a primary cuz no one voted.

53
00:02:51,874 --> 00:02:53,320
Scott: no, that's that happens.

54
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,244
Scott: It's simple fell there.

55
00:02:54,987 --> 00:02:58,060
Rym: So on the other side we had a public advocate.

56
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,238
Rym: I think was the other thing we could vote for which shit?

57
00:03:00,648 --> 00:03:07,878
Rym: Yeah so there were two people running and I looked up their platforms and their platforms are pretty much identical.

58
00:03:08,058 --> 00:03:11,413
Rym: other than The only way to distinguish these two candidates.

59
00:03:11,473 --> 00:03:12,820
Rym: is that the incumbent who I voted for?

60
00:03:13,702 --> 00:03:17,032
Rym: Black woman and the person running against her is a white dude.

61
00:03:17,252 --> 00:03:17,433
Scott: Mm-hmm.

62
00:03:17,754 --> 00:03:18,757
Rym: So I voted for her.

63
00:03:18,837 --> 00:03:20,822
Scott: cuz duh She hasn't done a bet.

64
00:03:20,882 --> 00:03:23,187
Scott: I mean if you look at her platform is great.

65
00:03:23,427 --> 00:03:39,960
Scott: if you look at like If you go to any sort of online community of New York City people who are either talking about local or state-level politics Basically everyone no matter what side they're on Bashes everybody who's currently in a elected position.

66
00:03:41,063 --> 00:03:44,333
Scott: Oh, it's exactly the same wasn't?

67
00:03:44,353 --> 00:03:44,433
Scott: you?

68
00:03:44,453 --> 00:03:48,406
Scott: go to a mess game and those are your players That you picked.

69
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:54,971
Scott: and during the offseason you were like, yeah trade for that guy And now that they're on the field your bum.

70
00:03:54,991 --> 00:03:56,939
Scott: Yeah, I got the field your bum, right?

71
00:03:57,482 --> 00:03:58,206
Scott: So that's what you see.

72
00:03:58,226 --> 00:04:00,580
Scott: You never see a single positive thing said about anyone.

73
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,493
Scott: So if you go look up, you know Letitia online and you'll see like people talking.

74
00:04:05,834 --> 00:04:08,960
Scott: everyone's like, ah, she's done such a crappy job She's worthless.

75
00:04:10,061 --> 00:04:14,839
Scott: But then it's like if you actually look at what anyone does it's like they're pretty much doing what they said.

76
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,166
Scott: They would All my representatives.

77
00:04:17,226 --> 00:04:18,652
Scott: It's like I was like.

78
00:04:18,812 --> 00:04:20,660
Scott: it's like even if I thought about running.

79
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,620
Scott: It's like well, I can't even run for anything cuz I'm not better than any of the people.

80
00:04:25,174 --> 00:04:28,209
Scott: Yeah But they're all doing what I would do on.

81
00:04:28,249 --> 00:04:33,027
Rym: the other difference was that the incumbent who I voted for has a little more like her.

82
00:04:33,067 --> 00:04:40,155
Rym: policies were more focused on social justice and The white dude his like the top of his policy list.

83
00:04:40,175 --> 00:04:46,259
Rym: we're all about small business Mm-hmm, and I feel like social justice is way more important right now for obvious reasons.

84
00:04:47,341 --> 00:04:51,559
Scott: Yeah, the important thing is small businesses in New York are having real problems.

85
00:04:51,619 --> 00:04:53,126
Rym: really Yeah, but it's really good.

86
00:04:53,267 --> 00:05:00,680
Rym: my message is that if you didn't vote in the primary, whatever But at least vote in the 2017 election not because it matters because you're probably gonna only have one person.

87
00:05:01,264 --> 00:05:03,320
Scott: Like it's like they're all I may say have no choices.

88
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:11,869
Scott: The only choice I have is I go in and it's like choose five judges and there's six judges and One of the judges is like not is a total crackpot.

89
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,374
Scott: Obviously not a real judge.

90
00:05:13,574 --> 00:05:14,437
Rym: Yeah, it's like.

91
00:05:14,477 --> 00:05:18,890
Rym: it's like It's choose the five judges you already have.

92
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,200
Rym: it's like, okay, just whack-a-mole and pick the crackpot.

93
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,760
Rym: It's almost like a capture for government.

94
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:28,560
Scott: This is why you got to go next year when you vote for governor because not only do you vote for governor the most important Action, right?

95
00:05:29,122 --> 00:05:38,999
Scott: You can also maybe kick out your awful state senator if you have an awful one like Like well the next district over does I have the best one and the next district over has the worst pretty much.

96
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:44,917
Rym: if you don't Live in the limits of actual New York City or state representatives are probably garbage, right?

97
00:05:45,077 --> 00:05:48,485
Scott: But also That's when the questions come out.

98
00:05:49,188 --> 00:05:52,620
Rym: Oh, yeah the questions that people don't read and vote randomly on the ones.

99
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,900
Scott: Remember we were in Beacon and we voted yes MTA money and everyone else voted no MTA money.

100
00:05:57,322 --> 00:05:58,988
Scott: And now everyone's complaining that.

101
00:05:59,088 --> 00:06:04,445
Scott: and as old as GeekNights that we were living in Beacon at the time As old as GeekNights, we voted.

102
00:06:04,505 --> 00:06:10,340
Scott: Yes, MTA money back then in last decade and now this decade everyone's like MTA sucks.

103
00:06:10,461 --> 00:06:12,330
Scott: It's like I seem to remember voting.

104
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:16,180
Scott: Yes, MTA money in 2008 or something.

105
00:06:18,782 --> 00:06:24,460
Rym: We could certainly fully fund the schools with a simple $1 per year tax and Homer's like taxes.

106
00:06:25,661 --> 00:06:31,417
Rym: So Yeah, in other news Scott forwarded this article to me and the headline really speaks for itself.

107
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:32,180
Rym: What was that headline?

108
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,479
Scott: Uranus opens and closes every day to let out planets.

109
00:06:40,007 --> 00:06:47,860
Rym: I feel like every copywriter in the entirety of Journalism was trying to craft the same headline for this story.

110
00:06:48,403 --> 00:06:49,308
Scott: I mean it really.

111
00:06:49,348 --> 00:06:51,420
Scott: I'm sure this is gonna tell you some story.

112
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,009
Scott: I don't haven't read it and I don't really care about like how.

113
00:06:54,129 --> 00:06:57,760
Scott: storms on Uranus or there's like a maybe a hole in the surface.

114
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:09,856
Scott: There's a storm in Uranus right now and this stuff inside of the planet that comes out for some reason You know and I saw pictures and it showed like it looked like, you know, Jupiter has a giant-ass storm on it.

115
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:22,579
Scott: giant-ass storm yeah, I Do was like a picture of like a day in the life of Uranus and in one part of it The storm was there and another part the storm was gone and it was opening and closing.

116
00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:23,322
Scott: somehow It's like.

117
00:07:23,563 --> 00:07:25,251
Scott: you don't need to really know much more than that.

118
00:07:25,271 --> 00:07:27,220
Scott: You're never going there not in your lifetime.

119
00:07:27,341 --> 00:07:30,177
Rym: So there's an episode of Rick and Morty and that shows great like.

120
00:07:30,197 --> 00:07:32,105
Rym: you haven't watched it I know but it's actually pretty great.

121
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,509
Scott: There was some drama with that show.

122
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,975
Rym: today a new drama.

123
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:41,960
Scott: No involving the No, the animators like making a union and the show running guy being upset.

124
00:07:42,703 --> 00:07:47,160
Rym: So the animator union thing has been an ongoing issue not just with that show.

125
00:07:48,621 --> 00:07:53,900
Rym: Yeah, well that that's a good time to good news for Tuesday the Korean TV stations are on strike - yeah.

126
00:07:54,522 --> 00:08:01,385
Rym: But anyway in that episode there's this like gaseous entity that That gets named fart.

127
00:08:02,087 --> 00:08:03,111
Rym: And really that's the thing.

128
00:08:03,231 --> 00:08:04,014
Scott: but it stands for.

129
00:08:04,054 --> 00:08:08,089
Rym: it's an acronym for something but you don't care No, so basically it can read minds and it.

130
00:08:08,611 --> 00:08:17,420
Rym: but I don't want to get into the weeds of this episode But it turns out it's evil and it'll destroy all life in the universe if it gets its way from its home like dimension.

131
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,304
Scott: so hold it in.

132
00:08:19,685 --> 00:08:25,204
Rym: so Morty murders it and then he goes back on the spaceship with Rick and Rick wasn't there.

133
00:08:25,265 --> 00:08:27,253
Rym: like Rick doesn't know that this thing was actually evil.

134
00:08:27,735 --> 00:08:32,120
Rym: and then Rick's like, I know you're sad You miss your friend fart, but I got good news.

135
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:38,820
Rym: I actually found out where his kind come from and There's a portal and there's thousands of them behind this portal and we're gonna get him.

136
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,900
Rym: We're gonna bring him into our universe and he's like, no, you'll kill us.

137
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,472
Rym: Oh, okay, and then Rick just farts and just laughs and that's the end of the episode.

138
00:08:45,773 --> 00:08:45,954
Scott: Mm-hmm.

139
00:08:46,656 --> 00:08:50,656
Scott: So yeah Uranus, uh, Always love a good Uranus joke.

140
00:08:50,757 --> 00:09:02,727
Rym: Yeah just killing time before we get to the main bits and Things of the day.

141
00:09:02,767 --> 00:09:04,212
Rym: So what do you got?

142
00:09:04,232 --> 00:09:04,774
Scott: So check this out.

143
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,360
Scott: This is a time-lapse, right?

144
00:09:07,021 --> 00:09:09,909
Scott: But this time-lapse is 30 days.

145
00:09:09,969 --> 00:09:13,760
Scott: I've made time lapses before of like Hurricane Sandy out my window and stuff.

146
00:09:14,323 --> 00:09:17,699
Scott: I recorded audio time lapses of board games at packs.

147
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:23,362
Rym: It's like if anyone wants that I have a branch recording of like a couple hours of the hurricane Whoever.

148
00:09:23,422 --> 00:09:31,620
Scott: this was made a 30-day long time-lapse, which like I'm just like, whoa How did you get you powered your camera for 30 days your 30 days of storage?

149
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:42,220
Scott: but I guess if you're only taking like what a photo every hour or so, there's plenty of time between shots to like You know change batteries or swap SD cards or who knows what you're doing.

150
00:09:42,842 --> 00:09:44,588
Scott: Right, we kept it, you know.

151
00:09:44,628 --> 00:09:48,179
Scott: still you got to remember and keep it going for 30 days and line everything up.

152
00:09:48,219 --> 00:09:48,802
Scott: make it Perfect.

153
00:09:49,043 --> 00:09:49,525
Scott: It's not easy.

154
00:09:49,545 --> 00:09:50,168
Scott: It's a lot of work.

155
00:09:50,771 --> 00:09:54,043
Scott: But this person was on a Container whistle.

156
00:09:54,805 --> 00:09:56,349
Rym: Oh, those are a good kind of whistle.

157
00:09:56,569 --> 00:10:08,340
Scott: I think it starts that it starts the time-lapse like leaving the Suez Canal And then it goes really really far and you can basically see the whole world, you know the whole Atlantic Ocean.

158
00:10:08,461 --> 00:10:16,596
Scott: I guess it's one of the better time lapses I've seen ever like it could be like top ten time lapses in history of time lapses.

159
00:10:16,656 --> 00:10:17,840
Scott: This is real good.

160
00:10:17,961 --> 00:10:19,458
Scott: It's only gonna take you how long to watch?

161
00:10:21,301 --> 00:10:21,723
Rym: Ten minutes.

162
00:10:21,965 --> 00:10:26,646
Scott: I think I think that's a good use of your ten minutes compared to whatever bullshit You were gonna do like listen to GeekNights.

163
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,133
Scott: It's just top this podcast right now.

164
00:10:28,213 --> 00:10:29,600
Rym: It's definitely worth ten minutes of your time.

165
00:10:30,441 --> 00:10:33,800
Rym: So this is just a tiny thing, but I bumped into it the other day, which is really cute.

166
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:42,145
Rym: It's a really short animation and it's just princess peach princess a peach pulling up a vegetable and Killing some dude with it.

167
00:10:42,205 --> 00:10:42,647
Rym: and that's it.

168
00:10:42,727 --> 00:10:43,530
Rym: and it's just really cute.

169
00:10:43,871 --> 00:10:44,815
Rym: and I like stuff like this.

170
00:10:45,397 --> 00:10:46,260
Rym: Okay, that's all I got.

171
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:47,484
Scott: Is it by an animator?

172
00:10:47,524 --> 00:10:52,278
Rym: We know it's not by one of the like four channels that we keep inexplicably going to.

173
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:53,464
Scott: you mean like Piece of sheep.

174
00:10:53,485 --> 00:10:54,874
Scott: He's a rice pirate.

175
00:10:54,894 --> 00:10:57,868
Rym: Yeah No, this is Mark Hendry.

176
00:10:58,009 --> 00:10:58,310
Scott: All right.

177
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:00,358
Scott: Well, maybe Mark Hendry's worth subscribing to.

178
00:11:00,438 --> 00:11:00,960
Scott: let's check it out.

179
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:07,034
Rym: Yeah, this is like 20 seconds long and the whole rest of the video is just like Storyboards and concept and animatic and how-to and like everything.

180
00:11:07,235 --> 00:11:07,396
Rym: Mm-hmm.

181
00:11:07,697 --> 00:11:08,240
Rym: It's just really cute.

182
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:17,660
Scott: Okay, so I yeah in the moment the booklet book is the fifth season I am halfway done with this book and I just read chapter where crazy shit happened.

183
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:19,374
Scott: I didn't think was gonna happen soon at the end of the book.

184
00:11:19,414 --> 00:11:26,840
Rym: I'm like, yeah I'm into it what I've read so far and I'm gonna power through it over the coming weeks so we can do a show On it, you know I can say about it.

185
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:35,519
Scott: It's doing one of those things that fantasy Novels tend to do where you have one chapter about one set of characters another chapter about another set of characters You start to go a little back and forth, right?

186
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:42,064
Scott: What these are people up to see what those people are up to right and usually when you have a situation like that It's a prince of nothing.

187
00:11:42,084 --> 00:11:44,573
Rym: Yeah, I end up caring a whole lot about some of them.

188
00:11:44,834 --> 00:11:48,508
Rym: Yeah, and not a whole lot about Like Oh kill moments again.

189
00:11:48,528 --> 00:11:50,175
Rym: I just want to yeah, it's like good stuff.

190
00:11:50,195 --> 00:11:51,460
Rym: another kill moments chapter.

191
00:11:53,862 --> 00:11:58,780
Rym: Then at the end when you stop seeing the horse breaking you're like wait, what's kill moments up to now?

192
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,667
Rym: Well, I want to kill moments chapter.

193
00:12:00,748 --> 00:12:05,087
Scott: No, I just want I just want horse breaking every chapter Interesting that kill moments.

194
00:12:05,127 --> 00:12:08,100
Rym: His name is kill moments considering the name of the king.

195
00:12:08,441 --> 00:12:15,420
Scott: Anyway, the point is that in this book fifth season that you should definitely read it is our book club selection.

196
00:12:15,962 --> 00:12:23,267
Scott: they have gotten to a point where I now equally care about Every single different thing they're focusing on.

197
00:12:23,307 --> 00:12:24,671
Scott: there is actually a moment.

198
00:12:24,731 --> 00:12:32,140
Scott: There is hot shit going on in all of the different Lines of story and I'm can't wait for the snatch car crash to happen.

199
00:12:33,306 --> 00:12:34,220
Rym: I just still can't get over.

200
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,847
Rym: I Love the planet and that kind of stuff.

201
00:12:37,148 --> 00:12:42,230
Rym: because now that I've seen that theme because there's the game player of games planet There's the dune planet.

202
00:12:42,251 --> 00:12:43,740
Rym: I'm starting to notice other planets.

203
00:12:43,981 --> 00:12:47,502
Rym: I think the prince of nothing planet might have like literal hell inside of it Mm-hmm.

204
00:12:47,744 --> 00:12:50,078
Rym: So I feel like that's gonna be a thing with me.

205
00:12:50,118 --> 00:12:56,220
Rym: now I might have to add planet with with a deal right next to weird magic system and precursor technology.

206
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:00,037
Scott: Yeah, if you don't have a terrible secret of space, it's terrible secret of the planet you are on.

207
00:13:00,158 --> 00:13:00,439
Scott: Yeah.

208
00:13:01,602 --> 00:13:14,460
Rym: So otherwise this weekend unless something horrible happens We're gonna actually do something that we should talked about a long time ago because as you know For every year at anime Boston, we would do a panel called judge anime by its cover.

209
00:13:15,062 --> 00:13:16,728
Rym: One of the up two of them are on YouTube.

210
00:13:16,748 --> 00:13:18,956
Rym: I think a cold guy uploaded one or two.

211
00:13:18,976 --> 00:13:24,359
Rym: Well, he uploaded one I uploaded two and we only stopped doing it because we skipped anime Boston.

212
00:13:24,379 --> 00:13:37,663
Rym: and now that there's like seven goddamn packs is to go to We've been cutting back on our non packs conventions Mm-hmm, and I don't know if we'll return to anime Boston regularly in the future Who knows.

213
00:13:37,703 --> 00:13:40,259
Scott: but the point is we're gonna do four times a year.

214
00:13:40,701 --> 00:13:41,002
Scott: I need to.

215
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:48,880
Scott: I guess we're gonna do the fall season in September and I forgot when I'm supposed to do this winter spring and summer ones.

216
00:13:50,164 --> 00:13:51,067
Scott: Someone will remind me.

217
00:13:51,469 --> 00:13:54,760
Scott: we're gonna take the anime chart for what animes are coming out.

218
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,780
Scott: So in about 30 days is gonna be new animes.

219
00:13:57,363 --> 00:13:59,453
Rym: The original one got like 13,000 views and we

220
00:13:59,513 --> 00:14:12,897
Scott: are going to go through each show looking only at the title the name of the studio a short description and a screenshot a promotional image and judge what that anime is gonna be about whether it's gonna be worth watching where there's gonna be good.

221
00:14:12,917 --> 00:14:18,460
Scott: and then Four months from now when the anime season ends, you can tell us how right or wrong we were.

222
00:14:18,722 --> 00:14:22,245
Scott: We've been very right in the past I gotta say in order.

223
00:14:22,306 --> 00:14:29,039
Scott: it'll be even more impressive if we actually make these predictions every single season And we can see what our actual track record is.

224
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,058
Scott: What's gonna help is that we can even make another set of videos at like the end of the post-mortem.

225
00:14:33,178 --> 00:14:38,706
Scott: we can do yeah at the end of a season we could be like how we did last season and then Is the new season.

226
00:14:38,746 --> 00:14:40,980
Scott: but so also you farted as the worst part?

227
00:14:44,561 --> 00:14:49,142
Scott: Usually your fart you always like oh here comes a deadly fart and I'll smell nothing What.

228
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:52,736
Scott: but no it smells like someone like diarrhea in the corner on the day.

229
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:59,080
Rym: The thing is It's definitely a fart as opposed to the seventh guest it actually I'm pretty sure this is the seventh.

230
00:14:59,281 --> 00:15:02,170
Scott: This is not going away.

231
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,293
Rym: I'm a space traveler.

232
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:03,915
Rym: What can I say?

233
00:15:04,156 --> 00:15:05,420
Scott: We found the guilty party?

234
00:15:07,702 --> 00:15:18,279
Rym: But in the video we uploaded in 2013 we were Right on literally every show except we said that Sailor Moon crystal was gonna be good.

235
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,286
Rym: They say that we did.

236
00:15:21,347 --> 00:15:21,748
Rym: we were like.

237
00:15:21,768 --> 00:15:24,379
Rym: this will probably be good and we gave a bunch of reasons why mm-hmm.

238
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:31,560
Rym: We were also Super super like doubly crazily right about eccentric family.

239
00:15:32,122 --> 00:15:37,060
Rym: What we said that show is gonna be was like 100% what that had no idea what we said then.

240
00:15:37,221 --> 00:15:39,220
Scott: But I know what we see now, which is that show is super great.

241
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:45,926
Rym: Well, I vaguely remember cuz I was looking at these videos recently to kind of guide how we do this now that we're gonna Do it as a YouTube show.

242
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:49,707
Rym: when we pulled the slide of her eccentric family You like clapped a little bit.

243
00:15:49,747 --> 00:15:51,596
Rym: you were like that shows gonna be our show.

244
00:15:52,179 --> 00:15:58,928
Scott: Anyway Lastly, I just want to remind everybody if you go to the internet which is I'm sure is a place that you go often.

245
00:15:59,349 --> 00:16:07,799
Scott: you can find us in many many places such as Twitter a Facebook our own website our own website for our crew calm.

246
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,387
Scott: iTunes Instagram where I posted like two photos.

247
00:16:12,427 --> 00:16:14,013
Rym: Google+ I post something by.

248
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:17,728
Rym: actually I forgot to post it the Tuesday show Doing that by hand.

249
00:16:17,808 --> 00:16:18,833
Scott: cuz I'm not doing that automatically.

250
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:21,619
Rym: there's no API that I know of And I don't think so.

251
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,342
Rym: Yeah, there were.

252
00:16:22,363 --> 00:16:26,338
Rym: cuz the only reason g-plus wasn't automated is there was never a fucking API for it that I know.

253
00:16:26,539 --> 00:16:29,948
Rym: right And don't tell me this than that.

254
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,253
Scott: different YouTube channels.

255
00:16:31,655 --> 00:16:34,927
Scott: Well, it's like so I You can find us on the internet.

256
00:16:34,947 --> 00:16:40,507
Scott: You should go on the internet and find us especially in our forum Which is more active than it has been.

257
00:16:40,889 --> 00:16:54,080
Scott: and when I told people to go there quite a few people listen to me and went there and if you're one of those people who went there and joined you should like just make a habit of going there once a Day and reading the threads that interest you and maybe saying something once in a while.

258
00:16:54,121 --> 00:17:01,529
Scott: Yeah They seen I got saying this has gotten people to sign up to our forum and it reminded me cuz not a lot of people Are posting regularly.

259
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:11,353
Rym: so like I'm like, I want to say 2006 through about 2009 the GeekNights forum was Crazy rocket like the traffic there was.

260
00:17:11,453 --> 00:17:11,855
Scott: kind of.

261
00:17:11,915 --> 00:17:18,480
Rym: it's never been dead But it's less rocking than it was but it's more rocket in the last year than it has been in the year before.

262
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,660
Scott: I think since we changed the software has helped a bit.

263
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:29,826
Scott: Yeah, cuz vanilla was starting to fall on his face pretty bad Yeah, and well cuz you know and we were paying for it then I saved a lot of money not paying for that anymore Yeah, and it works way better.

264
00:17:29,886 --> 00:17:33,980
Rym: what we're using now, like I have almost no complaints about this forum software.

265
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,306
Scott: well there I have a lot of complaints, but uh I fixed them.

266
00:17:37,647 --> 00:17:40,680
Rym: I've also I got to admit I've come around a little bit on Docker.

267
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:47,213
Rym: No, I've come around a little bit more Now that I've used it for some other projects.

268
00:17:47,334 --> 00:17:49,543
Scott: I still can't figure it the fuck out So I.

269
00:17:49,724 --> 00:17:55,244
Rym: so the problem is most people who make like Docker containers Suck at computers.

270
00:17:55,304 --> 00:18:02,180
Rym: so Docker containers feel like they suck if someone knows like generic computer and they make a Docker container.

271
00:18:02,221 --> 00:18:08,366
Rym: the Configuration of how you like make that Docker thing work Works the way you'd expect.

272
00:18:08,447 --> 00:18:10,313
Rym: the problem is most of the people are putting stuff in.

273
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,927
Rym: Docker are people who don't know shit about system Administration?

274
00:18:13,371 --> 00:18:14,179
Rym: that is my opinion.

275
00:18:14,962 --> 00:18:17,953
Rym: But this is a Thursday show so most you have no idea what we're talking about.

276
00:18:17,973 --> 00:18:18,475
Scott: still a mess.

277
00:18:18,976 --> 00:18:19,960
Scott: Yeah souvenirs.

278
00:18:20,504 --> 00:18:21,574
Scott: Well sort of right.

279
00:18:21,615 --> 00:18:28,193
Scott: so uh I mean, I guess we can talk about the concept of souvenirs first.

280
00:18:28,434 --> 00:18:37,919
Scott: right is like you're traveling somewhere and They're selling a bunch of useless crap like I love New York t-shirts and You buy one why?

281
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:45,699
Rym: So as a kid like when I like when I first when I did travel anywhere other than cedar point because our annual vacation We always went to see your point a bunch of times.

282
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,283
Rym: That was like.

283
00:18:46,303 --> 00:18:48,960
Rym: that was a big part of my life as you can tell if you listen to GeekNights.

284
00:18:50,061 --> 00:18:59,193
Rym: So when we went somewhere other than cedar point there was like this culture of you got to get souvenirs And it was just a thing and I didn't really think about it.

285
00:18:59,233 --> 00:19:02,518
Rym: every in every game in Disney World I have to get a souvenir.

286
00:19:02,538 --> 00:19:04,728
Scott: yet we would go to a gift shop and you'd go.

287
00:19:04,848 --> 00:19:09,425
Scott: every time there was a gift shop at a place you at you'd buy something and A lot of the times.

288
00:19:09,707 --> 00:19:16,516
Scott: it was because at least in those days the 90s 80s Those gift shops are selling things that you couldn't get.

289
00:19:16,536 --> 00:19:17,600
Scott: there was no internet.

290
00:19:17,821 --> 00:19:19,533
Scott: Yeah, it's a buy stuff on.

291
00:19:19,553 --> 00:19:20,480
Scott: there was no Amazon.

292
00:19:21,543 --> 00:19:21,843
Rym: You

293
00:19:22,124 --> 00:19:29,246
Scott: would see things in the gift shop that you would not see in any store in your town or any mall or any place That you could buy things at

294
00:19:29,286 --> 00:19:31,178
Rym: that board license plate with Mickey Mouse

295
00:19:31,318 --> 00:19:37,080
Scott: on it Alright, so you'd be like, whoa That is a thing and the only way I can get that thing is to buy it here in this one place.

296
00:19:37,401 --> 00:19:38,466
Scott: Therefore I will buy it.

297
00:19:38,506 --> 00:19:44,180
Scott: The other reason I think to buy a souvenir that legitimate reason is As some sort of memory thing, right?

298
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:57,587
Scott: It's like you buy this, you know from this place and then when you know someday in your house You notice it because you'd have it lying around and then now you're able to remember that trip you went on Whereas otherwise you might have forgotten it.

299
00:19:57,989 --> 00:20:00,139
Scott: Yep an additional memory aid.

300
00:20:00,501 --> 00:20:13,399
Rym: There's one other component to this is that most of the souvenirs I acquired over the years We're when I was a kid traveling with family and other family members would like push to get souvenirs, which usually men I mean a kid I just like buying stuff.

301
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:18,940
Rym: Yeah as a kid any time I had the discretion to make a purchase of any kind it was use it or lose this.

302
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:23,400
Rym: I was gonna use it, but I usually wanted like a toy as opposed to just a tchotchke.

303
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,574
Scott: Well, sometimes, you know you get you go to like a science museum gift shop.

304
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:28,518
Scott: This toys there.

305
00:20:28,538 --> 00:20:34,877
Scott: Yeah You know, sometimes you can get a useful thing and not just a useless thing like this.

306
00:20:34,897 --> 00:20:35,760
Scott: people collect spoons.

307
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:39,192
Rym: So yeah, so my grandma collected the fuck out of spoons.

308
00:20:39,413 --> 00:20:39,593
Scott: Uh-huh.

309
00:20:39,754 --> 00:20:41,520
Rym: She has a little tiny spoon.

310
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,300
Scott: Yes, the tiny collecting spoon that goes a wooden thing on the wall.

311
00:20:44,862 --> 00:20:53,596
Rym: They also did the pin thing after they went to Australia a bunch where they had a hat and they'd put all their pins in The Hat and they they really tried to get me into both of those.

312
00:20:53,616 --> 00:20:54,540
Rym: so they get us a spoon.

313
00:20:55,042 --> 00:20:57,919
Rym: Like at my birthday, I get like a real present and a spoon.

314
00:20:58,988 --> 00:21:14,487
Rym: but Before we get into actual souvenirs I found that as I've traveled more because in the last like six years I've traveled all over the world a bunch and also I moved to New York, or I don't get a lot of room I'd try to bring as little.

315
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:20,373
Rym: like I always try to come home with less than I flew out with Like I try to bring as little home as possible.

316
00:21:20,393 --> 00:21:22,749
Rym: So I Transitioned from like.

317
00:21:23,091 --> 00:21:28,598
Rym: the first time I was in London I was like who and I got some stuff and the first time I went to Hong Kong goes like oh shit I got to get something.

318
00:21:29,781 --> 00:21:38,210
Rym: But I really rapidly shifted from buying a traditional souvenir to buying something Consumable like a food or something that we'd bring.

319
00:21:38,271 --> 00:21:41,000
Rym: I'd bring home and we'd eat it immediately and then it's gone.

320
00:21:41,221 --> 00:21:43,349
Scott: Well for the memory purposes, we don't have internet.

321
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:45,859
Scott: So it's like there's some sort of digital record of my trip now.

322
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:49,597
Scott: So I don't really need to bring home like some tchotchke to remind myself.

323
00:21:49,618 --> 00:21:50,100
Scott: Well, that's it.

324
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,988
Rym: I make a point whenever I travel.

325
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:54,660
Scott: I got videos and photos that went up immediately.

326
00:21:54,760 --> 00:22:03,960
Rym: Even if I travel somewhere stupid I make sure that I take a few pictures with my phone no matter what because that Locks it into a bunch of digital timelines forever.

327
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:17,849
Scott: The other thing is that being someone who lives in New York City and works across the street from garbage souvenir shops Right that so I love New York t-shirts and other crap and someone who's been to places like The beach that sells horrible schlocky souvenir crap.

328
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:18,611
Scott: Oh, right.

329
00:22:18,631 --> 00:22:19,413
Scott: I can.

330
00:22:19,453 --> 00:22:23,265
Scott: now I now look at souvenirs as Schlocky worthless crap.

331
00:22:23,526 --> 00:22:30,390
Scott: So even if I go somewhere like say I don't know if I went to like Vienna Which is where I've never been but and they had like souvenirs.

332
00:22:30,771 --> 00:22:33,480
Scott: My eyes would still see them as worthless garbage crap.

333
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:39,760
Rym: Well, if they're that kind of souvenir like model statue of the Eiffel Tower, they don't have Eiffel Tower at Vienna.

334
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:42,334
Rym: Well, that's I'm on the Wikipedia page for the word souvenir.

335
00:22:42,354 --> 00:22:43,078
Rym: That's the first image.

336
00:22:43,339 --> 00:22:45,629
Scott: Yeah It's like you don't need a little metal Eiffel Tower.

337
00:22:45,951 --> 00:22:46,835
Scott: What are you gonna do with that?

338
00:22:47,096 --> 00:22:47,960
Rym: Yeah, that's worthless.

339
00:22:48,081 --> 00:22:50,199
Scott: Why did you even make those who buys those and what do they do with them?

340
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,140
Scott: So they put them in their house for a little bit and they throw them out.

341
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,811
Scott: They did go in a I don't know.

342
00:22:55,334 --> 00:23:01,300
Rym: my favorite souvenirs in my entire life are actually minor injuries.

343
00:23:02,961 --> 00:23:05,300
Scott: Partly cuz when I try that time, are you gonna take this episode?

344
00:23:05,701 --> 00:23:09,092
Rym: When I travel I tend to do sports like I run a lot.

345
00:23:09,153 --> 00:23:11,059
Scott: Yeah, don't do any with Rym mountain bike.

346
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:12,719
Rym: Yeah Yeah yet again.

347
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,309
Rym: So last weekend I was in Salt Lake City mountain biking.

348
00:23:15,509 --> 00:23:16,131
Rym: and what happened?

349
00:23:16,352 --> 00:23:18,078
Rym: someone on the trip like busted their hand.

350
00:23:18,118 --> 00:23:18,942
Rym: real bad It's.

351
00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:24,976
Scott: if we go on vacation if we're gonna do any sort of activities Don't go mountain biking with Rym's going alone and the rest of us are going a different way.

352
00:23:25,056 --> 00:23:26,926
Rym: if I go alone Nobody gets hurt.

353
00:23:26,946 --> 00:23:29,059
Rym: It's only if I go with other people they get hurt.

354
00:23:29,824 --> 00:23:32,460
Scott: At that time you almost found out your glasses fell whatever.

355
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:41,208
Rym: Yeah, but I survived and actually so there's a tiny crack like on the edge of the frames of those glasses and That little crack like I can't.

356
00:23:41,248 --> 00:23:43,879
Rym: you can't really see it, but I can feel it from my front my finger over it.

357
00:23:44,202 --> 00:23:45,079
Rym: This might sound weird.

358
00:23:45,821 --> 00:23:55,482
Rym: That is a souvenir to me because every time I put on those glasses I feel that little crack and I remember when I was out in the Outback on this pillar and I almost lost my only pair Of glasses.

359
00:23:55,562 --> 00:23:55,944
Scott: Yeah, great.

360
00:23:55,984 --> 00:23:58,797
Scott: Every time I look at the messed up scar on my chin.

361
00:23:58,817 --> 00:23:59,420
Scott: That's not a souvenir.

362
00:23:59,581 --> 00:24:00,163
Scott: That's like fuck.

363
00:24:00,203 --> 00:24:01,729
Scott: I wish my chin was the way it was before.

364
00:24:01,849 --> 00:24:09,040
Scott: like whatever like whatever I noticed like I was already a fucked Up chin from falling on my face previously and I fell in the same place of my same face two times.

365
00:24:09,101 --> 00:24:10,380
Rym: I got a couple scars on my knee.

366
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,844
Scott: My right chin is way bigger than my left chin and every time I feel them There's like some.

367
00:24:14,864 --> 00:24:16,600
Scott: I'm not getting plastic surgery to fix it fuck.

368
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:25,459
Rym: I got some spots on my left knee where hair doesn't grow because I've had like pretty big bike accidents over the years and Every one of those little divots that doesn't have hair.

369
00:24:25,963 --> 00:24:29,084
Rym: I have a specific memory of a great time I had mountain biking.

370
00:24:29,305 --> 00:24:32,700
Rym: great except actually the worst of those injuries was not mountain biking.

371
00:24:32,941 --> 00:24:36,193
Rym: I was just like biking on a sidewalk just way too fast.

372
00:24:36,394 --> 00:24:37,859
Scott: I mean I was just biking on a street.

373
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:41,067
Scott: Yeah into a tram track with a tram You were

374
00:24:41,107 --> 00:24:50,979
Rym: just biking on a street But it was the street filled with deadly traps to be fair Cuz as we learned after that trip the tram tracks claim a lot of bikers like on a monthly basis

375
00:24:50,999 --> 00:24:55,617
Scott: only Avoided all other obstacles, but there was one I did not foresee it came.

376
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,529
Rym: So it came before when I first started traveling globally.

377
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:03,359
Rym: My favorite souvenir was actually to bring back a tiny amount of local money.

378
00:25:04,481 --> 00:25:19,009
Rym: But now that I'm quite a bunch of bit of local monies from many places But now so now I have in my junk drawer I probably have like three pounds of coins from all over the world that Know why you can't exchange coins in the US.

379
00:25:19,411 --> 00:25:20,214
Rym: no one will take them.

380
00:25:20,996 --> 00:25:21,900
Scott: the bank will you know?

381
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,066
Rym: No, they'll take bills only.

382
00:25:23,208 --> 00:25:24,880
Scott: All right, what if they add up to enough money?

383
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,575
Rym: They still don't want the coins really for most countries.

384
00:25:27,595 --> 00:25:28,882
Rym: They don't want the coins You get.

385
00:25:28,903 --> 00:25:29,586
Scott: I mean you're in New York.

386
00:25:29,626 --> 00:25:32,040
Scott: You'd wait for someone from the country where the money's from.

387
00:25:32,241 --> 00:25:33,228
Scott: Yeah, change it with them.

388
00:25:33,248 --> 00:25:34,960
Rym: But the worst part is with the bills.

389
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,031
Rym: I'll bring them on my next trip, even though I think to India.

390
00:25:38,071 --> 00:25:41,588
Rym: that's technically illegal, but whatever really yeah Don't get if you take.

391
00:25:41,688 --> 00:25:48,358
Rym: so if you take rupees out of India In the airport that are like you cannot have Indian money when you come into the country.

392
00:25:48,499 --> 00:25:50,819
Rym: really You're also not allowed to have unapproved maps.

393
00:25:51,784 --> 00:25:52,879
Rym: What if a map?

394
00:25:54,121 --> 00:25:56,711
Rym: Shows the wrong borders in Kashmir?

395
00:25:56,751 --> 00:25:59,702
Rym: that map is technically illegal and you can be Arrested.

396
00:25:59,782 --> 00:26:01,428
Scott: or does Google Maps correct itself.

397
00:26:01,548 --> 00:26:03,915
Scott: No, when you enter in technically you're smart.

398
00:26:03,956 --> 00:26:05,180
Rym: Don't get me started on this.

399
00:26:05,501 --> 00:26:08,940
Scott: Okay, I guess I'm not bringing my phone to India while I'm planning to go to India.

400
00:26:09,343 --> 00:26:11,780
Rym: The other thing you cannot bring is satellite phones.

401
00:26:11,961 --> 00:26:13,567
Scott: It's not high on my list of places to go.

402
00:26:13,587 --> 00:26:16,680
Rym: satellite phones are like way illegal in most of Asia.

403
00:26:17,121 --> 00:26:17,422
Rym: Why?

404
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:21,431
Rym: because it lets you communicate without going through the state-controlled systems.

405
00:26:21,712 --> 00:26:27,126
Rym: Okay, so sad phones are a big no-no Mmm, you're just a sad phone.

406
00:26:27,648 --> 00:26:28,290
Scott: I've seen one.

407
00:26:28,791 --> 00:26:38,500
Rym: The the weirdest thing about them is that there's Just enough of a delay like when you're talking to where it makes conversations like really awkward and hard to follow.

408
00:26:38,861 --> 00:26:43,240
Rym: But it's not so long that you actually like pause and back off and wait for it.

409
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,629
Rym: So it's just really hard to talk on them.

410
00:26:44,649 --> 00:26:46,139
Rym: Mmm, but I digress.

411
00:26:46,943 --> 00:26:47,947
Rym: So now I just have this pie.

412
00:26:47,987 --> 00:26:51,440
Rym: I probably have like five or six hundred dollars worth of currency from all over the world.

413
00:26:51,561 --> 00:26:52,505
Rym: I can't do anything with it.

414
00:26:52,926 --> 00:26:57,959
Rym: Anyway, I got now I got a pile of like 25-pound notes.

415
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,144
Scott: Why don't we make a website?

416
00:26:59,164 --> 00:27:13,140
Scott: and the way the website works is people send in their money and we have a shittier Exchange rate but we let people descend in bulk all kinds of crazy currencies And then we'll just add it all together from all the different people that send us their money and we'll sort it out.

417
00:27:13,421 --> 00:27:15,410
Rym: Why don't I just make it and I'll make a loot box?

418
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:18,983
Rym: if you saw I'll make a pet here on patreon For GeekNights.

419
00:27:19,244 --> 00:27:23,560
Rym: if you're at that tier, I'll mail out a loot envelope and it's just random money from around the world.

420
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,687
Scott: Oh you get rid of your money that way.

421
00:27:24,848 --> 00:27:28,348
Scott: I was gonna say we should make a tier on patreon Which is don't give us real money.

422
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,579
Scott: Send us all your random foreign monies.

423
00:27:31,403 --> 00:27:39,260
Scott: We'll give you all Worthless stuff cuz and then we'll take we'll collect a bunch of foreign monies from all these people So and then sort them out and then we'll be able to exchange them.

424
00:27:39,461 --> 00:27:48,799
Rym: there is there is a coin from a country I travel to a lot not gonna name names cuz I don't want any of you to Take advantage of this cuz I'm not gonna take advantage of it other than one time when I did.

425
00:27:49,861 --> 00:27:54,435
Rym: It is detected as a quarter by pretty much any vending machine in America.

426
00:27:54,455 --> 00:27:58,589
Rym: Hmm, and it is worth Way less than a quarter.

427
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:00,660
Rym: Oh, really way less.

428
00:28:01,829 --> 00:28:05,284
Rym: I discovered this by accident But why don't we?

429
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:08,533
Rym: I did fill a laundry machine downstairs with this currency once.

430
00:28:08,573 --> 00:28:12,759
Scott: let if we if we go to this country again Let us get some rolls from the bank.

431
00:28:13,301 --> 00:28:19,039
Scott: Yeah, we could do that and then buy dollar, you know, $1 bottled water at conventions for much less.

432
00:28:20,242 --> 00:28:21,978
Scott: That's pretty much the only time I ever use a vending machine.

433
00:28:22,862 --> 00:28:25,212
Rym: So do you have any souvenirs?

434
00:28:25,513 --> 00:28:27,220
Rym: because I don't have that many actually.

435
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:36,879
Rym: So with the caveat of I'm excluding gifts because I've gotten gifts from people who are from countries But I treat that as like a very separate kind of thing.

436
00:28:37,201 --> 00:28:41,840
Scott: So I mean when we would travel places, you know, we go to the gift shop and you'd buy something, right?

437
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:52,140
Scott: But when I was very little but I guess I don't remember how we got into the habit of doing this But for some reason we would always buy a snow globe just like oh, I don't know why we did.

438
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:57,531
Scott: You know, it's I don't know but it's like I don't know when it started But I just remember it continuing like we got it.

439
00:28:57,672 --> 00:28:59,239
Scott: suddenly we had four snow globes.

440
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:05,200
Scott: I just like every time he went somewhere new he bought another fucking snow actually did the same thing with music boxes.

441
00:29:06,081 --> 00:29:08,100
Rym: Okay, so that that's just the thing that happens.

442
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:12,840
Scott: I guess they probably they're probably all like they're mad dusty and I think they don't have any water in them.

443
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:29,011
Scott: But I think somewhere in my house, there's probably like a box with like 50 to 100 snow globes in it and the old ones are like the kind that's made of white plastic and inside and it's weird to think of like Just how many different snow globes there are back in those days.

444
00:29:29,031 --> 00:29:34,356
Scott: like who designed and made all of those different globes Right, and then it's like then they had a different kind.

445
00:29:34,457 --> 00:29:36,124
Scott: eventually It stopped making the white kind.

446
00:29:36,185 --> 00:29:46,440
Scott: it started being the black kind that were a little bigger and had sparkles inside instead of the white Snow and they were a little less fancy because the inside of it wasn't like this little plastic sculpture that was painted.

447
00:29:47,144 --> 00:29:54,380
Scott: Not I mean, I'm saying using very the word sculpture very liberally But they started just being like a sheet of plastic with an image printed on it inside.

448
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:59,874
Rym: Yeah, that in general you've noticed that there's like with a lot of these kinds of shots keys Like there was an era in the 90s.

449
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:04,534
Rym: I feel like that was when like the production values of all that shit went up.

450
00:30:05,217 --> 00:30:12,378
Scott: and then in the 2000s the production values went way down and it was the early 90s was an 80s was up.

451
00:30:12,438 --> 00:30:22,976
Scott: and then well I mean you can even go to the museum's I've seen like, you know the world the world's fair souvenirs from you know Way back right and they were really high quality friggin souvenirs.

452
00:30:22,996 --> 00:30:23,880
Scott: I'm like, dude, I buy that.

453
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,516
Scott: Why doesn't someone like just make those again?

454
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,424
Rym: But you want to be you want to.

455
00:30:28,585 --> 00:30:32,880
Rym: why don't you make the quality of souvenirs Funko pop equivalent of snow globes?

456
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,700
Scott: But I mean like that's our company.

457
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,452
Scott: Physical quality of souvenirs has only been going down over time.

458
00:30:39,512 --> 00:30:40,957
Scott: It has never gone up right.

459
00:30:40,977 --> 00:30:44,609
Rym: apparently the Colombian 25 peso coin also works as a quarter.

460
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:47,660
Scott: Is it worth less than a quarter Scott?

461
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,349
Rym: Make a guess is 25 pesos worth less than 25 cents.

462
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:52,818
Scott: I don't know how much Colombian money's worth.

463
00:30:52,838 --> 00:30:53,300
Rym: Just make it.

464
00:30:54,381 --> 00:30:56,112
Rym: There's a Fermi guess you can make there.

465
00:30:56,152 --> 00:30:58,344
Rym: I Don't have any Colombian.

466
00:30:58,444 --> 00:31:00,894
Scott: There are countries that have money that's worth more than US dollar.

467
00:31:01,074 --> 00:31:02,380
Rym: Oh, yeah, that is true.

468
00:31:02,863 --> 00:31:04,071
Scott: Columbia sells a lot of drugs.

469
00:31:04,373 --> 00:31:05,259
Scott: It's not what they're known for.

470
00:31:06,441 --> 00:31:11,055
Rym: So you refuse to make one currency stereotype and you make a very different stereotype.

471
00:31:11,115 --> 00:31:11,456
Rym: Yes.

472
00:31:11,557 --> 00:31:12,499
Scott: That was why it was funny.

473
00:31:14,421 --> 00:31:19,800
Rym: So that so I was hoping when I went to the snow globes page on Wikipedia that I'd learned something really interesting.

474
00:31:20,303 --> 00:31:22,535
Rym: Now this is literally the most boring topic on earth.

475
00:31:22,575 --> 00:31:23,420
Scott: no, it's really boring.

476
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:34,880
Scott: However, it was interesting to find out at one point I don't know if it's still true But at one point in time there was like an interest in snow globes and like particular rare ones that were no longer made.

477
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:37,971
Scott: We're worth a bunch of money and we happen to have two of them.

478
00:31:38,553 --> 00:31:39,577
Scott: I think I still have them.

479
00:31:39,617 --> 00:31:40,440
Scott: So there's one.

480
00:31:41,202 --> 00:31:45,337
Scott: It was I remember like seeing a news story like Bronx Zoo snow globe.

481
00:31:45,357 --> 00:31:46,240
Scott: They don't make it anymore.

482
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:51,340
Scott: It's worth something and I'm like I have that is a white plastic snow globe with two polar bears in it.

483
00:31:51,722 --> 00:31:56,660
Scott: And it said Bronx Zoo and I still have it I think has no water in it, but it is mad dusty.

484
00:31:56,961 --> 00:31:57,703
Scott: But we still have it.

485
00:31:58,085 --> 00:32:09,060
Scott: and then as a place in Connecticut that you I don't know it was worth traveling to you can read all about online called Gillette Castle, which Keep in mind is a castle in North America.

486
00:32:10,226 --> 00:32:15,074
Scott: It's not old Right, it's not a real castle, you know like a European castle.

487
00:32:15,114 --> 00:32:19,227
Scott: that's actually from the medieval times But it is structurally a castle.

488
00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:25,620
Scott: and when we went there we bought a snow globe and then I saw a thing like oh They don't make that snow globe from Gillette Castle anymore.

489
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:32,040
Scott: It's in high demand from collectors and I have one of those really old snow globes used bone chips to make the snow.

490
00:32:32,924 --> 00:32:34,520
Scott: I was not aware of that.

491
00:32:34,921 --> 00:32:35,443
Scott: I thought it was.

492
00:32:35,724 --> 00:32:39,960
Scott: I thought it was plastic bits because the ones I the oldest ones I have are the white plastic kind.

493
00:32:40,101 --> 00:32:46,752
Scott: So I figure if there's white plastics Clear plastic for the top that the bits would be white plastic.

494
00:32:46,812 --> 00:32:47,293
Scott: I'll shoot up.

495
00:32:47,534 --> 00:32:52,171
Rym: How old is plastic And how old are snow globes?

496
00:32:52,593 --> 00:32:58,089
Scott: So plastic is When the old telephones are made with bakelite.

497
00:32:58,249 --> 00:32:59,673
Scott: that was sort of plastic.

498
00:32:59,914 --> 00:33:02,160
Rym: So it's probably the first like mass-market plastic.

499
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:06,877
Scott: I don't know if it counts as plastic right but bakelite is from like the 50s 60s ish, right?

500
00:33:06,937 --> 00:33:07,740
Scott: It's not it's not.

501
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:13,056
Scott: Plastic wasn't really used a lot until like 80s 90s 70s, you know.

502
00:33:13,096 --> 00:33:18,271
Scott: snow globes appeared in the Tracks in the 70s were made of plastic early 19th century.

503
00:33:18,331 --> 00:33:21,460
Rym: France seems to be when snow globes became a thing.

504
00:33:22,142 --> 00:33:23,547
Scott: Oh, so they were like metal and glass.

505
00:33:23,888 --> 00:33:26,416
Rym: they were like glass bone chips bone chips.

506
00:33:26,817 --> 00:33:28,184
Scott: Uh-huh Alrighty.

507
00:33:28,385 --> 00:33:28,647
Rym: All right.

508
00:33:28,707 --> 00:33:29,553
Scott: I thought I don't have.

509
00:33:29,573 --> 00:33:30,540
Scott: we didn't collect that kind.

510
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:36,638
Scott: We collected el cheapo kind not el fancy ceramic with the glass ball on top that lights up kind.

511
00:33:36,678 --> 00:33:37,160
Scott: we didn't do that.

512
00:33:37,763 --> 00:33:40,099
Scott: We did cheapo $2 plastic ones.

513
00:33:40,421 --> 00:33:47,974
Scott: So I guess that I have but they're still good because you look at them and you remember it's like oh, yeah I remember we went to that Gillette Castle and that Bronx Zoo and that wherever right.

514
00:33:48,356 --> 00:33:52,715
Rym: so most of the souvenirs I've gotten over my life are buried in boxes at my mom's house.

515
00:33:52,996 --> 00:33:53,378
Rym: Yeah

516
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:54,081
Scott: mine, too Yeah,

517
00:33:54,322 --> 00:34:08,339
Rym: but the the only two that I can well the only three I can think of that have real Significance that I think about regularly are one When I went to Disney World for the first time on a band trip Was also the first time I flew in a plane that I was not sitting in the front of.

518
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:15,713
Rym: It was the first time I went on a commercial flight as opposed to just riding in someone's Cessna Mm-hmm, and I was in Disney World.

519
00:34:15,753 --> 00:34:26,897
Rym: everyone's buying all these garbage Tchotchke like things and I remember the only souvenir I bought was this really tasteful Black and white like Mickey statue like old steamboat Mickey.

520
00:34:27,158 --> 00:34:30,049
Rym: Mm-hmm I just I remember I did it.

521
00:34:30,129 --> 00:34:41,130
Scott: I did a similar thing in Disney World and you actually Reminded me of like one of the few souvenirs that is actually in my apartment and not in a box somewhere Right is when I went to Disney World.

522
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:43,120
Scott: I wanted to get a fancy souvenir too, right?

523
00:34:43,601 --> 00:34:57,715
Scott: So what I got is I got this basically this pad of paper And it's basically this base and then a little notepad on it and the notepad has like a metal flap that holds the top down Like you'd put it on a fancy executive desk.

524
00:34:57,796 --> 00:35:00,889
Scott: that kind of deal Obviously, it's not gold or anything.

525
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:06,800
Scott: It's just like gold colored metal And then on top of the metal gold cover that holds the pad flat.

526
00:35:07,282 --> 00:35:10,814
Scott: It was like, you know, like Disney World Mickey with his magic hat whatever.

527
00:35:10,834 --> 00:35:12,580
Scott: and it's you know, it's like Disney World, right?

528
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:17,071
Scott: So it's like if you were an executive at Disney World You would put that on your desk and I bought.

529
00:35:17,091 --> 00:35:18,863
Scott: I was like, oh that's real fancy I want that.

530
00:35:19,265 --> 00:35:23,239
Scott: and it was so fancy that throughout my entire childhood I never wrote on that pad ever.

531
00:35:23,589 --> 00:35:29,376
Scott: Yeah And it's now in one of the drawers in my apartment and I saw it like the other day like oh there and you just Reminded me of it.

532
00:35:30,201 --> 00:35:36,407
Scott: So the second one is I when I went back to this I guess we had similar things at Disney World by one by one Really fancy souvenir.

533
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:37,533
Scott: No, don't we did.

534
00:35:37,554 --> 00:35:38,700
Scott: I didn't buy stupid Mickey ears.

535
00:35:41,045 --> 00:35:41,895
Scott: I didn't buy you know.

536
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:53,093
Rym: So the second one that I have a memory is of is pretty recent But Emily and I went back to Disney World for Ken marks wedding Mm-hmm, and I was the first time experiencing Disney as an adult and there was.

537
00:35:53,274 --> 00:35:59,159
Rym: there was a good time all I had all around but Every night because you know, there's not much to do at night.

538
00:36:00,383 --> 00:36:18,969
Rym: Yeah, but instead of seeing the fireworks in Disney the secret was because we're staying in shades of green is to go to the Polynesian because there's a nice like outdoor bar with good food and You can see over the water and you can see all the fireworks from there and they pipe the music from the fireworks Into the bar.

539
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:19,371
Rym: Mm-hmm.

540
00:36:19,573 --> 00:36:20,860
Rym: It's just like it's a really nice place.

541
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:28,100
Rym: so we went there every night and had a drink and some food hung out and Because it's the Polynesian they have ridiculous tiki drinks.

542
00:36:28,501 --> 00:36:44,911
Rym: so I ordered the ridiculous tiki drink and I got it in the ridiculous souvenir tiki mug and I still have that giant ridiculous tiki mug and anytime I drink a weird tiki drink I will put it in that ridiculous tiki mug and that encapsulates The entirety of my Disney experience.

543
00:36:44,971 --> 00:36:55,228
Scott: between that and the black and white Mickey Mouse You actually reminded me of another kind of souvenir which is the kind that you get for free when you do a thing Especially you go to a sporting event.

544
00:36:55,308 --> 00:36:56,051
Rym: I still have it.

545
00:36:56,251 --> 00:36:57,335
Rym: I still have that ticket.

546
00:36:57,957 --> 00:36:58,860
Rym: It's in my jewelry box.

547
00:36:58,981 --> 00:37:00,126
Rym: I used to keep it in my wallet.

548
00:37:00,187 --> 00:37:00,790
Scott: Oh the ticket.

549
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:02,720
Scott: Yeah, I still have the ticket also.

550
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,314
Scott: So I don't know where it is, but I do know I have it.

551
00:37:05,616 --> 00:37:10,435
Rym: ass sweat Seeping into my wallet was slowly eroding the quality of that ticket.

552
00:37:10,475 --> 00:37:14,950
Rym: tickets now somewhere secure But that ticket to this day.

553
00:37:15,011 --> 00:37:17,080
Rym: It was the greatest hockey game I've ever seen in my life.

554
00:37:17,261 --> 00:37:18,707
Scott: I wasn't even thinking of ticket stubs.

555
00:37:18,828 --> 00:37:20,676
Rym: I was thinking I kept that fucking ticket.

556
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:26,240
Scott: That's a souvenir I'm thinking of like things you get like for example, you know and again a quality decreasing over time, right?

557
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:32,965
Scott: If you go to a baseball game today The best you're gonna get is shitty bobblehead night, which isn't even gonna be as good as the bobbleheads They sell.

558
00:37:33,005 --> 00:37:41,435
Scott: it's like a lower tier of bobblehead tinier and crappier and it has Advertisements on it right in back in like late 80s early 90s.

559
00:37:41,515 --> 00:37:42,880
Scott: and we went to like Shea Stadium.

560
00:37:43,423 --> 00:37:46,480
Scott: We went I remember specifically we went on beach towel day.

561
00:37:46,984 --> 00:37:51,598
Scott: We got full-size Beach towels the kind you would pay money for.

562
00:37:52,041 --> 00:37:54,493
Scott: Fofre just handed him out of the door.

563
00:37:54,513 --> 00:37:55,800
Scott: No the gate, right?

564
00:37:56,161 --> 00:37:57,105
Scott: We all had one.

565
00:37:57,125 --> 00:38:01,340
Scott: so when we go to the beach every single person had this met Snoopy MetLife Beach.

566
00:38:02,582 --> 00:38:07,320
Scott: We all had them and we still have them because it was such a high-quality beach towel.

567
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:11,336
Scott: It's lasted 20 something years plus maybe even 30 years, right?

568
00:38:12,741 --> 00:38:14,004
Scott: That's how good the stuff was.

569
00:38:14,105 --> 00:38:24,720
Scott: now you'll get we go to like the playoff hockey which caused way more than a regular season baseball game And you give you this tiny worthless towel and a light stick that lasts five minutes.

570
00:38:25,262 --> 00:38:29,440
Scott: They throw the light stick out you rub your head with the towel and you put it in the closet.

571
00:38:30,221 --> 00:38:32,730
Rym: It's like come on and the only other souvenir I have.

572
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:36,160
Rym: that I think is kind of important even though I technically I guess smuggled an antiquity.

573
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:48,460
Rym: So, you know, I as you all know I used to spend a lot of time in Turkey as particularly Istanbul And I worry that I'll never be able to visit that city again, or at least not in the immediate term by any stretch.

574
00:38:49,162 --> 00:38:53,354
Rym: but a problem and I definitely contribute a little bit to this.

575
00:38:53,414 --> 00:39:04,445
Rym: but in countries like Turkey certain antiquities are protected but many of the more important ones are in extreme states of neglect or Are otherwise not controlled.

576
00:39:04,545 --> 00:39:09,660
Rym: so in Istanbul if you're ever there the famed Theodosian walls are still there.

577
00:39:10,121 --> 00:39:18,188
Rym: They've been restored to varying degrees of historical accuracy in some sections But the bulk of them are there in there.

578
00:39:18,468 --> 00:39:18,669
Rym: like.

579
00:39:18,729 --> 00:39:26,580
Rym: the core is the same original core from like 400 AD And those walls are probably the most important famous walls in all of history.

580
00:39:26,962 --> 00:39:30,780
Rym: The Great Wall is probably the only thing even close to it in comparison.

581
00:39:31,242 --> 00:39:32,426
Rym: But this thing actually fought off.

582
00:39:32,527 --> 00:39:36,000
Rym: like these walls were literally impenetrable until gunpowder.

583
00:39:36,723 --> 00:39:43,479
Rym: But if you're in Istanbul and you go over where these walls are on the edge of the old city You can just climb up on top of them.

584
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:49,080
Rym: Like there are people who have like made houses inside of them in some parts.

585
00:39:50,162 --> 00:39:54,760
Rym: I was threatened by some people with weapons who were living in there who didn't want me poking around.

586
00:39:55,344 --> 00:40:04,399
Rym: But I had a whole adventure Walking through the literal Theodosian walls like climbing up in these towers and it was just there like there's no one guarding.

587
00:40:04,419 --> 00:40:04,860
Rym: There's nothing.

588
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:09,255
Rym: So as I was leaving, I wasn't gonna like chip a piece out of these things.

589
00:40:09,296 --> 00:40:15,876
Rym: for obvious reasons Let me damage this ancient object further than I already have by walking around inside of them.

590
00:40:15,896 --> 00:40:22,645
Rym: Mm-hmm, but Some was some chips of the old part of the wall it like falling all over the ground.

591
00:40:23,147 --> 00:40:30,136
Rym: so I picked up this one tiny chip and I took it home with me and Obviously if everyone did this, this would be a problem and I'm saying you all shouldn't do it.

592
00:40:30,217 --> 00:40:30,779
Rym: I got mine.

593
00:40:31,375 --> 00:40:31,500
Scott: Well

594
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:52,540
Rym: But I have this tiny piece of the actual Theodosian walls and it's just sitting like I keep it with me and It's very profound Whenever I touch it to think about all that history and also to think about all the time I spent living in that city and the fact that I can't go back to that city right now.

595
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,403
Rym: It's not safely.

596
00:40:53,804 --> 00:40:55,872
Scott: you can not safely those planes that go there.

597
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:58,020
Scott: It is not say you go to the airport and give money.

598
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,506
Rym: It is not safe.

599
00:41:00,068 --> 00:41:01,232
Scott: don't let you in it is not.

600
00:41:01,352 --> 00:41:03,119
Rym: I would I would be feel safer.

601
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:11,200
Rym: I Can list a lot of places that you would consider pretty dodgy that I would be more comfortable visiting than Istanbul right now.

602
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:16,047
Rym: It is not safe for an American to travel to Istanbul without taking Precautions.

603
00:41:16,087 --> 00:41:17,639
Rym: that would make the trip not fun.

604
00:41:19,721 --> 00:41:22,048
Rym: So, yeah, I have that piece and I will probably have.

605
00:41:22,109 --> 00:41:30,736
Rym: I will probably carry that souvenir along with that Hockey game to my grave the only time I went anywhere where there could have been antiquities.

606
00:41:30,756 --> 00:41:31,860
Scott: stealing is on to Israel.

607
00:41:32,563 --> 00:41:39,289
Scott: I didn't steal any antiquities because I'm not evil person But I'm trying to remember what I did buy.

608
00:41:39,329 --> 00:41:39,691
Scott: that I don't.

609
00:41:39,892 --> 00:41:44,245
Scott: I didn't buy a lot because they didn't have a lot of money And actually I spent.

610
00:41:44,286 --> 00:41:45,549
Scott: I think I remember.

611
00:41:45,589 --> 00:41:49,779
Scott: I spent all my money or like I had money and then I lost my remaining monies.

612
00:41:50,345 --> 00:41:51,140
Scott: Do I remember?

613
00:41:52,261 --> 00:41:58,720
Scott: But basically cuz like even that was when I started to realize souvenirs are crap Especially with like, you know, like you could people are coming.

614
00:41:58,821 --> 00:42:03,146
Scott: I was 18 and like you could tell like these people coming up to you on the street They could tell you're a terrorist, right?

615
00:42:03,207 --> 00:42:07,647
Scott: Yeah, and they're like, hey, come on buy my drag about my drag And I'm like, I can tell it's direct now.

616
00:42:07,687 --> 00:42:08,470
Scott: I'm 18.

617
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:10,920
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I'm not even a New Yorker.

618
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:13,012
Scott: You haven't lived in New York yet, but I already know.

619
00:42:13,032 --> 00:42:13,977
Rym: Oh, I do have.

620
00:42:14,299 --> 00:42:27,903
Rym: well so I used to go to India a lot and I had a lot of free time just wandering around in Mumbai and Because you know the exchange rate and everything like there's the people trying to scam tourists all the time and sell them tapestries and carpets Usually carpets.

621
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:29,631
Scott: All right, I'll take a carpet.

622
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:31,460
Scott: These guys are trying to sell me like worthless junk.

623
00:42:31,822 --> 00:42:34,560
Rym: Yeah, they're trying to sell you a carpet and it's a scare.

624
00:42:34,644 --> 00:42:35,847
Rym: They're good They're gonna like.

625
00:42:35,868 --> 00:42:41,799
Rym: you'll get it carpets in the end But you'll get one way more carpets than you expected for way more money than you expected.

626
00:42:41,819 --> 00:42:42,100
Scott: Why not?

627
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,229
Scott: Why can't I just get the one carpet?

628
00:42:43,815 --> 00:42:45,825
Rym: Yeah, good luck There's a whole.

629
00:42:45,865 --> 00:42:46,148
Rym: there's like.

630
00:42:46,289 --> 00:42:46,510
Rym: I could.

631
00:42:46,792 --> 00:42:51,612
Rym: I could do a whole show Explaining in detail how the carpet and tapestry scams work.

632
00:42:51,732 --> 00:42:52,775
Scott: I just like one carpet.

633
00:42:52,956 --> 00:42:53,939
Scott: No one carpet.

634
00:42:53,979 --> 00:42:55,785
Scott: They're Fascinating one carpet.

635
00:42:55,926 --> 00:43:03,311
Scott: I'm only by one one and in fact when I much one no when I touch one No, when I travel to these places you try to hand me another one.

636
00:43:03,351 --> 00:43:04,013
Scott: Nope not touching it.

637
00:43:04,334 --> 00:43:12,060
Scott: I have watched other people Succumb to these scams and it's kind of funny how I mean I see people get scammed by the CD guys on the street.

638
00:43:12,361 --> 00:43:20,372
Rym: Yeah, but these get like the scams is particularly in like India and Turkey and like the places in that general like places that are like that.

639
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:29,397
Rym: they're surprisingly elaborate how these scams go, but I Want to make it want to make a game about that?

640
00:43:30,322 --> 00:43:31,508
Rym: We pick a board game about that.

641
00:43:31,548 --> 00:43:32,594
Scott: You could you owe a bunch of carpets.

642
00:43:32,614 --> 00:43:39,767
Scott: You got to get rid of them all Marrakesh - yeah You already won all the carpets now Zelda.

643
00:43:40,169 --> 00:43:42,297
Rym: so one time I was I was on my like.

644
00:43:42,317 --> 00:43:43,120
Rym: I had a whole day to kill.

645
00:43:43,281 --> 00:43:44,913
Rym: I had one meeting in the morning and I had nothing to do.

646
00:43:44,973 --> 00:43:45,859
Rym: I was flying on that night.

647
00:43:46,342 --> 00:43:53,788
Rym: so my cab driver like I asked him to my driver asked him to drive me back to my hotel and He starts on one of the scams.

648
00:43:54,149 --> 00:43:57,971
Rym: because one of the things they'll do is say hey if you got some time How about I can draw?

649
00:43:58,011 --> 00:44:03,359
Rym: let me take you to me I gotta want to get some coffee and then let's stop by my brother's shop and let's go have some tea there.

650
00:44:03,379 --> 00:44:07,895
Rym: if Any cab driver ever asks you to have tea with them they're going to scam you.

651
00:44:07,915 --> 00:44:09,319
Rym: they're not gonna rob you.

652
00:44:09,901 --> 00:44:11,065
Rym: they're gonna scam you.

653
00:44:11,085 --> 00:44:11,527
Rym: mm-hmm.

654
00:44:11,627 --> 00:44:18,808
Rym: the ones who are gonna rob you will be a beautiful woman who comes up to you at a bar and Asks you to join her at a better bar.

655
00:44:19,209 --> 00:44:20,573
Rym: that they're going to rob you.

656
00:44:20,593 --> 00:44:21,937
Rym: Yes, possibly kill you.

657
00:44:22,037 --> 00:44:26,534
Rym: Correct, but So I know it's a scam like I'm pretty much like.

658
00:44:26,554 --> 00:44:27,560
Scott: I don't understand about that.

659
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,680
Scott: It's like why are you asking someone to go to another bar?

660
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:32,479
Scott: It's like just walk up to someone stab them and take their money.

661
00:44:32,881 --> 00:44:35,230
Scott: Why you got to do this elaborate nonsense?

662
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:37,580
Rym: because the bar they take you to is in on it.

663
00:44:38,143 --> 00:44:40,237
Scott: So if they stabbed you in this bar wouldn't go down.

664
00:44:40,297 --> 00:44:44,312
Scott: Yes, so What if you happen to accidentally walk into a bar that's in on it?

665
00:44:44,413 --> 00:44:45,136
Rym: Let's do a show out.

666
00:44:45,156 --> 00:44:45,960
Rym: Well, then you're fucked.

667
00:44:47,081 --> 00:44:48,185
Scott: Did they stab you right away?

668
00:44:48,205 --> 00:44:49,470
Rym: Let's do a show on scams.

669
00:44:50,092 --> 00:44:51,096
Scott: I don't know a lot about scams.

670
00:44:51,116 --> 00:44:52,100
Rym: I know a lot about scams.

671
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:52,582
Rym: I'm not evil.

672
00:44:52,743 --> 00:44:53,887
Rym: I'll do a patreon on scams.

673
00:44:53,987 --> 00:44:57,623
Rym: I know a lot about tourist scams in other countries Mm-hmm.

674
00:44:57,824 --> 00:45:05,074
Rym: But anyway, so the cab driver like basically Begins the scam and I'm bored to get a lot of time to kill.

675
00:45:05,696 --> 00:45:14,871
Rym: So I basically Decided I was willing to spend about a hundred bucks because that's about how much it was gonna take Probably for that kind of scam to experience the full scan.

676
00:45:15,533 --> 00:45:16,376
Scott: how many carpets he got?

677
00:45:16,516 --> 00:45:17,680
Scott: How come you don't give me a carpet?

678
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:23,620
Rym: I bought this Chachki, that's a bunch of wooden nesting peacocks and it's on the piano in there.

679
00:45:23,881 --> 00:45:32,753
Rym: Okay, and that's because I had to but you had to buy something out of the end because otherwise the people who run the elaborate Scam, they'll actually get in trouble with the scam bosses.

680
00:45:32,793 --> 00:45:38,160
Rym: Like it'll fuck them up pretty bad So but basically I went through the whole thing.

681
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:45,250
Rym: So I haggle with these people for like an hour over tea About the carpets and I what about that one?

682
00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:46,213
Rym: What about that one?

683
00:45:46,233 --> 00:45:48,080
Rym: And then I don't want a carpet in the end.

684
00:45:48,361 --> 00:45:49,485
Rym: So at least buy something.

685
00:45:49,806 --> 00:45:52,156
Rym: so I start looking around and I see this one Chachki.

686
00:45:52,176 --> 00:45:53,180
Rym: and then there's the sword.

687
00:45:53,421 --> 00:45:56,900
Scott: How do you end up running a Chachki store that you have to scam people to buy stuff in?

688
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,749
Scott: Why not just run a legit store that sells growthful stuff.

689
00:46:00,251 --> 00:46:03,020
Rym: So here's the thing the those kinds of scams.

690
00:46:03,585 --> 00:46:06,785
Rym: It's not like they steal $4,000 from a tourist.

691
00:46:07,167 --> 00:46:12,864
Rym: It's more like they sell the tourists a carpet a set of carpets for $4,000.

692
00:46:12,864 --> 00:46:17,560
Rym: that if you bought equivalent carpets in the US would have been about two thousand dollars.

693
00:46:17,841 --> 00:46:22,906
Rym: Hmm, so they make a profit of like two thousand dollars But it cost it.

694
00:46:23,047 --> 00:46:27,479
Rym: you're buying it in the country where it cost two hundred dollars to make those carpets.

695
00:46:28,643 --> 00:46:33,660
Rym: So there is a huge upside and they pretty much only go after.

696
00:46:34,901 --> 00:46:52,947
Rym: wealthy looking people basically look for white people from countries where The people who are tourists from those countries don't know shit about scams and are very easy to scan and you steal enough from them To be valuable to you, but you don't scam them for so much money That they're gonna realize they even got scammed.

697
00:46:53,549 --> 00:46:56,598
Scott: I think when we were in Israel, they were selling these backgammon sets.

698
00:46:56,679 --> 00:47:00,469
Rym: everywhere In Turkey was the same thing with a backgammon set.

699
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:05,648
Scott: I could tell by looking at him that they were basically Mass-produced backgammon in Mexico.

700
00:47:05,708 --> 00:47:08,820
Rym: It was these like stone carved chest sets, right?

701
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:17,334
Scott: These backgammon sets came in two sizes small and big and I you could tell that Even though they looked like they were handcrafted some kind of art.

702
00:47:17,735 --> 00:47:19,120
Scott: They were actually mass-produced.

703
00:47:19,582 --> 00:47:24,200
Scott: They just looked they were just mass-produced things that looked like they were handcrafted with patterns and design.

704
00:47:24,561 --> 00:47:29,140
Rym: So these Mexican chest sets are handcrafted but in factories, right?

705
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:32,332
Scott: I mean it this wasn't like some actual artisan thing, right?

706
00:47:32,372 --> 00:47:34,320
Scott: This was some, you know, just some nonsense, right?

707
00:47:35,161 --> 00:47:40,619
Scott: So, you know people who you know people bought quite a few of those and I was like no I got one.

708
00:47:41,801 --> 00:47:42,203
Scott: I'm good.

709
00:47:43,248 --> 00:47:45,457
Scott: I like backgammon a lot, but that's not.

710
00:47:45,477 --> 00:47:50,796
Scott: I don't need that Yeah, but basically so that and I don't want to carry that around for the rest of this trip.

711
00:47:51,037 --> 00:48:01,438
Rym: that souvenir I have is like the memory of fully interacting with one of those things and It was just really fascinating to see like the four or five different people who?

712
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:06,916
Rym: Rotated in through the shop as part of the elaborate thing to get me to buy all these carpets that I didn't buy.

713
00:48:06,936 --> 00:48:07,478
Rym: Mm-hmm.

714
00:48:08,902 --> 00:48:11,799
Rym: And actually bringing that home was probably illegal because it's made out of wood.

715
00:48:12,663 --> 00:48:14,610
Scott: So customs didn't notice the wood.

716
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:17,160
Rym: customs doesn't notice shit, let's smuggle.

717
00:48:17,521 --> 00:48:25,709
Rym: I mean what what I would want that when I was in Hong Kong the first time I brought back a shit ton of tea Mm-hmm to bring back tea.

718
00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:26,332
Rym: It depends.

719
00:48:26,392 --> 00:48:27,879
Rym: probably you can usually bring back tea.

720
00:48:28,221 --> 00:48:38,297
Rym: I mean I could see not bringing back leaves and trees, but already had a checked bag full of like a giant sack of vegetable matter.

721
00:48:40,065 --> 00:48:40,592
Scott: Dead though.

722
00:48:40,754 --> 00:48:44,389
Scott: Yeah, but It's not like it's a tomato Scott.

723
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:47,060
Rym: another thing someone might have hidden in a suitcase.

724
00:48:47,201 --> 00:48:49,249
Rym: That is a large sack of vegetable matter.

725
00:48:49,329 --> 00:48:49,711
Scott: I'm pretty.

726
00:48:49,791 --> 00:48:50,694
Scott: even if they inspected it.

727
00:48:50,715 --> 00:48:51,357
Scott: I'm sure they would go.

728
00:48:51,458 --> 00:48:52,000
Scott: Oh, it's tea.

729
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:52,984
Scott: Oh, yeah, and close it.

730
00:48:53,205 --> 00:48:56,700
Scott: Yeah, I mean there's plenty of teas from Hong Kong available in the u.s.

731
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,407
Scott: It's not any legal thing to import.

732
00:48:58,427 --> 00:48:59,210
Rym: there is a difference there.

733
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:01,781
Scott: That's where you know where you're bringing enough to open up a tea Shop.

734
00:49:02,101 --> 00:49:05,269
Scott: yeah, you're not like a business getting around some Tara for something.

735
00:49:05,811 --> 00:49:15,680
Rym: so really but it's partly that sometimes like especially when I travel Europe I would forget to declare all the things I had and There's an allowance, but it's okay as long as you declare it.

736
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:19,733
Rym: But I wouldn't remember like that I'd bought a bunch of wine because I was there for two weeks.

737
00:49:19,814 --> 00:49:21,984
Rym: like on day two I bought a bunch of wine.

738
00:49:22,145 --> 00:49:35,518
Scott: the only thing that I would really buy and try to like import is go to you know Asia and buy electronic goods that are unavailable or more expensive here Like yes, I'll buy that camera that cost twice as much in America.

739
00:49:35,579 --> 00:49:39,980
Scott: Yes Buy that video game that is not available when I was waiting for the mind.

740
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:47,046
Rym: You know my weird cell phone is the Xperia when I was waiting for this to come out in the u.s.. I was in Hong Kong and you saw one.

741
00:49:47,167 --> 00:49:48,311
Rym: I saw the Asian.

742
00:49:48,511 --> 00:49:57,200
Rym: yes, I'll buy that very tiny laptop which was Great because actually the Asian variant of this phone is way better than the American version because it has a fingerprint sensor.

743
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:01,520
Rym: Yeah, but and it would have worked on LTE in the u.s.

744
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:04,670
Rym: Mostly, but it wouldn't work that well in Europe.

745
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:05,573
Rym: and the bands?

746
00:50:05,593 --> 00:50:06,015
Rym: I it was.

747
00:50:06,075 --> 00:50:08,644
Rym: it was worth it to wait for the u.s One phone has all bands.

748
00:50:09,145 --> 00:50:10,610
Rym: Yeah, does it every band.

749
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:13,740
Scott: I thought the iPhone has effectively every band you're gonna need.

750
00:50:14,347 --> 00:50:15,199
Rym: I want to check on that.

751
00:50:15,982 --> 00:50:21,079
Rym: I mean, I will look it up because there are some bands that are not so easy to get but I digress.

752
00:50:22,281 --> 00:50:32,662
Scott: Then did the new it like since like I forget at what point but at some point eventually Like at least the Verizon iPhone that I have which is unlocked because Verizon deals Effectively.

753
00:50:32,682 --> 00:50:37,239
Scott: you can just put a SIM card in it as long as you can get the SIM card activated, which is the hard part.

754
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:39,624
Rym: Anthony's in here in the shed.

755
00:50:39,924 --> 00:50:40,566
