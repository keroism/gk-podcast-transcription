Rym: Yeah, good fresh.

13
00:00:47,508 --> 00:00:52,439
Rym: They used to have a lot of good like takeaway lunch sandwiches But they really cut back on that to try to get you to pay way more money.

14
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,110
Rym: Yeah for basically the same food sitting down.

15
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,535
Scott: They sell the big cookie there.

16
00:00:56,595 --> 00:00:57,860
Scott: There's like a thousand calories.

17
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,426
Rym: I got something I shouldn't have gotten.

18
00:00:59,446 --> 00:01:03,280
Rym: they had a thing they called a cookie a french cream donut and it was - yo tart.

19
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:08,443
Rym: it was basically just a fried pastry filled with like Vanilla cream.

20
00:01:08,664 --> 00:01:09,005
Scott: Yeah.

21
00:01:09,065 --> 00:01:14,760
Scott: Anyway, so it's a place and when I go there usually they had to sit this tartan.

22
00:01:15,021 --> 00:01:15,788
Scott: That's really good.

23
00:01:15,949 --> 00:01:17,099
Rym: All those tartans are so good.

24
00:01:17,581 --> 00:01:23,280
Scott: It's like ricotta cheese on a piece of bread and then they put prosciutto and fig and aruba.

25
00:01:23,642 --> 00:01:27,848
Rym: I used to get the one that had like salmon and dill And they put honey on it, right?

26
00:01:28,028 --> 00:01:28,530
Scott: It's good stuff.

27
00:01:28,731 --> 00:01:32,965
Scott: So I was like, you know what I Was like thinking about it.

28
00:01:32,985 --> 00:01:34,192
Scott: Like I kind of want one of those.

29
00:01:34,312 --> 00:01:40,229
Scott: and then I was like, wait a minute That requires no cooking No cooking whatsoever.

30
00:01:40,793 --> 00:01:47,120
Scott: You can just buy bread Yeah, and a tub of ricotta cheese and I have honey and you buy a thing of prosciutto.

31
00:01:48,012 --> 00:01:52,286
Rym: so Discovered the ability to make your own lunch.

32
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:56,340
Scott: you can make this thing and like five minutes for way less money than they charge.

33
00:01:57,761 --> 00:02:02,768
Scott: The bread I got at the grocery was not as good as the bread they have but I guess I could have bought a bread There or made a bread.

34
00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:07,838
Scott: I mean you can buy just baguettes there Yeah, but it you know, they make it on that tartan bread, right?

35
00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:10,770
Scott: No Yeah, but you know the bread from the grocery store wasn't bad.

36
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:14,778
Scott: It just wasn't the same bread, but it Tasted basically the same.

37
00:02:16,022 --> 00:02:17,300
Scott: So that was a good time.

38
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,625
Scott: I was like, oh and now I have like, you know The I have enough to like.

39
00:02:20,665 --> 00:02:24,259
Scott: make it again like, you know, like twice before I go to PAX.

40
00:02:24,299 --> 00:02:25,387
Scott: at least That's not too bad.

41
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,680
Rym: We're picking up a CSA tomorrow.

42
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:31,805
Rym: So we got a cook every night starting tomorrow to use up all that food, you know, if anyone out there it's like think you know.

43
00:02:31,825 --> 00:02:37,500
Scott: when you go to a restaurant or something and you think about The things you're paying for there that cost a lot of money.

44
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,154
Scott: It's like some of those things like you have fancy steakhouse.

45
00:02:40,195 --> 00:02:41,180
Scott: They make a fancy steak.

46
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:44,328
Scott: It's like you could do that But like there's actually.

47
00:02:44,389 --> 00:02:46,620
Rym: that's a way easier to do than a lot of the other things.

48
00:02:46,902 --> 00:02:48,678
Rym: It's pretty simple is easy to do.

49
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:54,060
Scott: But even if I have the instructions on how to do it just doesn't you want to make a steak like in those places?

50
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,960
Rym: Just sous vide it like it's gonna be fine.

51
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,566
Scott: I'm just saying it's like the way they made.

52
00:02:57,586 --> 00:03:03,400
Scott: it's like I even if I try really hard and follow lots of internet instructions I just can't get it to taste the same way.

53
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:07,440
Rym: I look at it more like something I do with like cocktails, but I never order a cocktail.

54
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:08,486
Rym: That's really easy to make.

55
00:03:08,546 --> 00:03:11,060
Rym: I order the ones that are a pain in the ass to make because I don't want to make.

56
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:19,047
Scott: There are some things that you might be buying at places that for a lot of money like computers that you could make very easily Like computers, right?

57
00:03:19,067 --> 00:03:19,368
Scott: You couldn't.

58
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:20,934
Scott: you couldn't make a video card easily.

59
00:03:21,155 --> 00:03:22,139
Rym: No, but I can buy.

60
00:03:24,101 --> 00:03:27,874
Scott: The recipe for the guac at Chipotle is on the Chipotle website.

61
00:03:28,054 --> 00:03:28,616
Scott: I've made it.

62
00:03:28,716 --> 00:03:32,120
Rym: it's ridiculously easy Yeah, but guacamole is pretty easy to make in general.

63
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,786
Scott: I'm just saying you can get the even.

64
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:37,922
Scott: it comes out even better than what you get at Chipotle when you buy it there because It's fresh.

65
00:03:37,942 --> 00:03:39,870
Scott: Yeah, it just goes bad real fast.

66
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:41,979
Scott: So I hope you have a lot of friends in a party to eat it.

67
00:03:42,864 --> 00:03:45,820
Rym: So I went out to watch the Eclipse and everyone went out to watch you.

68
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,360
Rym: Yeah, the streets are all blocked in Midtown like our streets weren't blocked.

69
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:53,485
Scott: Everyone was but there's I guess in the Times Square tourist zone There's lots of pedestrian walk.

70
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:57,780
Scott: Yeah areas and the sign part was blocked by a lot of tall buildings.

71
00:03:58,141 --> 00:04:01,997
Scott: So people were huddled in masses in the areas where the Sun shone through.

72
00:04:02,017 --> 00:04:05,831
Rym: Yep Meanwhile shadow walkers like people just actually trying to get somewhere.

73
00:04:05,851 --> 00:04:08,100
Rym: We're like walking in the shadow between all these people.

74
00:04:08,646 --> 00:04:09,980
Rym: I was trapped in Bryant Park.

75
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,507
Rym: I actually jumped a fence to get into the subway and then I walked through the subway to get out on the other side to Get away from the crowd.

76
00:04:16,771 --> 00:04:17,640
Scott: Oh, I don't have that problem.

77
00:04:17,861 --> 00:04:21,995
Rym: But the craziest thing was that you know, New York like strangers don't interact.

78
00:04:22,036 --> 00:04:26,287
Rym: when a stranger interactions You they're either trying to rob you or they're crazy Or they're all.

79
00:04:26,328 --> 00:04:30,889
Scott: in return is when there's a reason to interact It's like but they don't if there's no reason.

80
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,780
Scott: they don't even you know, you don't acknowledge each other's existence.

81
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:38,960
Scott: But once you have a reason, you know, which takes some doing but then you interact with them.

82
00:04:39,022 --> 00:04:45,880
Rym: Yeah And I watched a lot of people just like interacting and more importantly there weren't just like interacting and like talking about the Eclipse.

83
00:04:46,301 --> 00:04:52,658
Rym: people were like sharing and passing around their different Eclipse viewing glasses and it was like a big old block party.

84
00:04:52,678 --> 00:04:55,025
Rym: and So I actually the watch.

85
00:04:55,066 --> 00:04:59,121
Rym: I looked at it through a bunch of different kinds of glasses after checking them to make sure they weren't Fake.

86
00:04:59,522 --> 00:05:00,144
Rym: Mm-hmm.

87
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:05,240
Rym: I saw easily two dozen people seriously hurt themselves looking at it without glasses.

88
00:05:05,562 --> 00:05:06,828
Scott: I saw people looking at the sun.

89
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,980
Rym: I saw literally there's this husband and wife.

90
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,376
Rym: They're kind of standing behind me and I hear the wife go.

91
00:05:11,396 --> 00:05:22,560
Rym: man I wish I brought my sunglasses and the guys like mine are working fine and I turn around and they're clearly regular sunglasses And I feel like that guy's gonna have a real bad day.

92
00:05:22,761 --> 00:05:26,111
Scott: There are a lot of tweets showing stupid people looking at the Sun.

93
00:05:26,352 --> 00:05:31,372
Scott: my favorite though was those one That was like our own president looking right up ahead.

94
00:05:31,472 --> 00:05:35,749
Scott: It was a Twitter search for the words Hurt my eyes my eyes hurt.

95
00:05:35,829 --> 00:05:37,115
Scott: Yes, and there was a lot of results.

96
00:05:37,155 --> 00:05:38,100
Scott: and then there was another one.

97
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,164
Scott: This is the really good one.

98
00:05:39,767 --> 00:05:42,900
Scott: It was just clips from neo gaff discussion.

99
00:05:43,101 --> 00:05:48,720
Scott: And oh, I saw that one too and it was like a bunch of people like before the Eclipse saying like it's a bunch of bullshit.

100
00:05:48,861 --> 00:05:53,788
Scott: Yeah, my mom's eye doctor says, you know People are getting crazy for no reason.

101
00:05:53,808 --> 00:05:56,618
Scott: and then a whole bunch of boats like oh my god.

102
00:05:56,658 --> 00:05:57,280
Scott: No, they weren't.

103
00:05:58,583 --> 00:05:59,758
Scott: It's like I'm a fucking moron.

104
00:06:00,823 --> 00:06:01,880
Scott: Why did we not believe?

105
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:03,940
Rym: But it was pretty cool.

106
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,680
Rym: I'm glad I took the time to go and just sort of enjoy it because it didn't get crazy dark.

107
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:08,893
Rym: I mean, we got like 70% in New York.

108
00:06:09,681 --> 00:06:12,634
Scott: I mean, I look it didn't get dark, but it's like I looked at it enough.

109
00:06:12,654 --> 00:06:13,960
Scott: I had brought my welding glass.

110
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,448
Scott: Yeah, I already owned and was.

111
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:19,136
Scott: apparently I was like, oh I have a welding glass.

112
00:06:19,196 --> 00:06:20,420
Scott: I wonder if that's sufficient.

113
00:06:20,521 --> 00:06:25,981
Scott: I went to the NASA safety website Yeah, and NASA was like you need a welding glass of 12.

114
00:06:25,981 --> 00:06:29,140
Scott: But some people for some people 12 is still not good enough.

115
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:34,362
Scott: They you should get 14. mine was 12 and I'm like, well, they said it's safe with 12.

116
00:06:34,362 --> 00:06:38,140
Scott: So I looked at it for like a fraction of a second even with the glasses that seem legit.

117
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,092
Rym: I only looked at it for like 10 seconds.

118
00:06:40,152 --> 00:06:46,070
Rym: I was like, okay, I saw it yeah, but I was more impressed by looking at the Dappling through the trees in Bryant Park.

119
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:54,335
Scott: cuz it made a million little crescents all over the ground Reflections off the buildings like Buildings, but I also I brought made a box of the hole in it this morning.

120
00:06:54,375 --> 00:07:01,515
Scott: It took like one minute Yeah, and then I looked at my box of the hole in it and then I was like, okay I'm still amazed at how many people today seem to have no idea.

121
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:05,068
Rym: an eclipse was happening Like how do you how do you live your life?

122
00:07:05,549 --> 00:07:06,773
Rym: It is not no stuff.

123
00:07:07,114 --> 00:07:07,475
Scott: I don't know.

124
00:07:08,077 --> 00:07:08,960
Scott: How does that happen?

125
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:09,522
Scott: I don't know.

126
00:07:09,603 --> 00:07:15,371
Scott: I feel like my feet has been nothing but people talking about the eclipse Also, I think a lot of people don't respect the box of the hole in it.

127
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:22,447
Scott: Yeah box of the hole in it is real good Camera without a film or a sensor.

128
00:07:22,588 --> 00:07:25,356
Rym: Yeah, you don't get the color aspect of it.

129
00:07:25,376 --> 00:07:26,078
Scott: Hey, dude, why not?

130
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:32,543
Rym: I'll debate which poll because usually when people make the pinhole they use it to make the dapple effect and get the outline on The grounds.

131
00:07:33,247 --> 00:07:34,654
Scott: no, I made a box of the hole in.

132
00:07:34,674 --> 00:07:35,700
Scott: it is basically just a camera.

133
00:07:35,761 --> 00:07:36,145
Scott: You can look.

134
00:07:36,185 --> 00:07:37,519
Scott: you can like look at anything through it.

135
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,580
Scott: Yeah, you know just you basically lets you look at stuff behind you as long as it's bright enough because it's a tiny pinhole.

136
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,577
Scott: So you need a lot of light to see anything, right?

137
00:07:45,283 --> 00:07:47,419
Scott: Something behind you is real bright you can just see it in there.

138
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:50,700
Rym: So anyway, that was fun and the next one will be a while from now.

139
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,679
Scott: And I think the best thing I saw you could fly around the world to see a different one.

140
00:07:53,981 --> 00:07:58,360
Rym: Yeah, the best thing I saw was someone showed during the eclipses path.

141
00:07:58,847 --> 00:08:09,220
Rym: they took a Google or whatever one of those traffic sites and you can see the path of the eclipse in terms of where there were traffic jams When you're zoomed all the way out from the u.s.

142
00:08:09,361 --> 00:08:09,823
Scott: But I did.

143
00:08:09,863 --> 00:08:14,066
Scott: is I only looked at the eclipse a little bit because I figure I can see better Images of it on the internet.

144
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:14,930
Scott: Yeah, and I can't.

145
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,100
Scott: and why risk my eyes even with protection?

146
00:08:17,241 --> 00:08:21,179
Scott: Yeah, so I spent most of my time taking pictures of the people.

147
00:08:21,807 --> 00:08:28,999
Rym: Yeah, you know I saw a lot of people doing being really into it and cheering and people were again hurting their eyes and yelling.

148
00:08:29,019 --> 00:08:35,166
Scott: a lot of People were like a lot of people are trying to take a picture with their phone And then I had mobile.

149
00:08:35,186 --> 00:08:38,595
Rym: people ask me just randomly like why aren't my pictures turning out?

150
00:08:38,674 --> 00:08:39,958
Rym: I was just like what's wrong with you?

151
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:46,218
Scott: Some people are putting their you know, they're protective glasses in front of their camera work.

152
00:08:46,258 --> 00:08:51,066
Scott: Okay Good luck exposing it properly.

153
00:08:51,327 --> 00:08:53,133
Rym: I watch someone do that.

154
00:08:53,434 --> 00:08:55,340
Rym: They held it and they took their little like glasses.

155
00:08:55,664 --> 00:08:56,760
Rym: They held it in front of their phone.

156
00:08:57,101 --> 00:08:58,426
Rym: They held their phone up and then they went.

157
00:08:58,727 --> 00:09:03,176
Rym: ah because they looked right into the Sun with the realize because they were holding their glasses, yep.

158
00:09:04,181 --> 00:09:08,840
Rym: So in some news Intel is launched in their 8th gen core CPUs.

159
00:09:09,161 --> 00:09:10,906
Scott: Yeah, they've been going real slow.

160
00:09:10,966 --> 00:09:14,316
Scott: But I think is AMD with their rise ends actually pushing.

161
00:09:14,798 --> 00:09:15,600
Scott: I don't know what's going on.

162
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,569
Rym: No, I'm honestly I'm not.

163
00:09:17,749 --> 00:09:18,714
Rym: it's really sure.

164
00:09:18,854 --> 00:09:19,276
Scott: schedule.

165
00:09:19,296 --> 00:09:20,040
Scott: I don't know the deal is.

166
00:09:20,221 --> 00:09:29,615
Rym: I'm not really sure if this is Nvidia pushing if the AMD Leap forward is going to be sustained or is even really relevant or not.

167
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:30,438
Scott: a joke in the long run.

168
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:30,819
Scott: I don't know.

169
00:09:31,421 --> 00:09:32,624
Rym: uh, we'll see how this all goes.

170
00:09:32,804 --> 00:09:38,177
Scott: but anyway, the point the thing is this new a gen is Mobile only laptop only.

171
00:09:38,217 --> 00:09:41,769
Scott: so this is gonna be a big boost for like surfaces and Mac books and the.

172
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:44,819
Scott: you know All the things we were complaining like the last MacBook is sucky.

173
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:45,522
Scott: Yeah.

174
00:09:45,782 --> 00:09:50,187
Scott: Well, it's now when you get these chips in there It'll you it'll be significantly better, right?

175
00:09:51,111 --> 00:09:54,327
Scott: But the desktop is not upgraded yet, but it's coming.

176
00:09:54,528 --> 00:09:54,990
Scott: apparently.

177
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,513
Scott: Yeah But it's not really.

178
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:59,744
Scott: I don't think it's gonna be a major upgrade for the desktop area.

179
00:09:59,824 --> 00:10:04,322
Scott: really unless you're the kind of desktop That's like got an Intel CPU with no GPU.

180
00:10:04,944 --> 00:10:06,893
Scott: if you're that kind and maybe oh, yeah Then you're good.

181
00:10:06,953 --> 00:10:08,925
Rym: That's like the best use case for this.

182
00:10:08,966 --> 00:10:17,234
Scott: if you want to make a Tiny tiny computer that can play like 4k video, but if you are just if you have a GPU in there I don't think this is gonna be better.

183
00:10:17,274 --> 00:10:21,530
Scott: So I'm gonna build a new computer when the ninth gen CPU comes out.

184
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:25,690
Scott: Yeah, whether it's the the what's I think this is what I don't not sure.

185
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:26,856
Scott: There's like they want to talk about.

186
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:27,479
Scott: there's like gonna be.

187
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:29,730
Scott: the 10 nanometer is a 10 the next number.

188
00:10:30,051 --> 00:10:30,272
Rym: So.

189
00:10:30,573 --> 00:10:32,903
Scott: and then there's another one they talk about like coffee something.

190
00:10:32,943 --> 00:10:34,771
Scott: so I don't know which one of those is right now like.

191
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:46,410
Rym: we're gonna wait and see which one of those is the good one by ridiculously fast like Crazy CPU on my new computer is running it like a little over a gigahertz right now.

192
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,077
Scott: Yeah, my computer is actually just fine.

193
00:10:48,098 --> 00:10:53,054
Scott: I just you know, even the thing is Again, right?

194
00:10:53,154 --> 00:10:58,048
Scott: It's it's not nearly as bad as it was when I had that shady hard drive.

195
00:10:58,289 --> 00:11:02,990
Scott: Oh, yeah That was crashing you but it's still got some some slight weird issues, right?

196
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:10,528
Scott: so for example Like I'm not even near the computer and like it detects that like headphones have been connected in a dialog box.

197
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:11,070
Scott: What?

198
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:11,876
Rym: What?

199
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:13,909
Scott: That's that's weird.

200
00:11:14,593 --> 00:11:15,599
Scott: It's not like before.

201
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:24,089
Scott: it was like blue screening with some consistency But there was one blue screen like I came home from going out and those blue screen once and I'm like, huh?

202
00:11:25,411 --> 00:11:26,595
Scott: I want no blue screens.

203
00:11:26,917 --> 00:11:30,248
Rym: That is part of why I upgrade cuz my computer was way older than your computer.

204
00:11:30,288 --> 00:11:35,070
Scott: Yeah like Older, but it wasn't bad about maybe heat issues.

205
00:11:35,171 --> 00:11:41,100
Scott: So I'm definitely gonna get you know, it's like I could just buy a computer now with super cooling But that's stupid when I have a perfectly good computer.

206
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,130
Rym: Yeah, but I gotta say like haven't gotten my new computer.

207
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:46,284
Rym: It's just so nice that it's basically silent.

208
00:11:46,384 --> 00:11:47,550
Rym: It's so fast.

209
00:11:49,331 --> 00:11:51,664
Scott: Also somebody published this Google Doc.

210
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:52,790
Scott: I can give you the link for it.

211
00:11:53,092 --> 00:11:53,779
Scott: That has.

212
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:54,990
Scott: it's basically just a spreadsheet.

213
00:11:55,491 --> 00:12:04,610
Scott: It's read-only but someone's keeping it up to date and it has all of these small computer cases available Oh and all their stats in one big spreadsheet.

214
00:12:04,672 --> 00:12:05,544
Scott: so you can be like Oh.

215
00:12:06,151 --> 00:12:13,652
Scott: So I could find one that lets you put the GPU in sideways and also allows water cooling and I can get these a really Tiny computer.

216
00:12:14,194 --> 00:12:15,197
Scott: that's also godlike.

217
00:12:15,538 --> 00:12:16,500
Rym: Yeah, not too shabby.

218
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:28,161
Rym: Maybe because when my current htpc finally dies That's the route I'm going there's gonna be like a tiny CPU and a tiny motherboard with a tiny m2 drive and like one RAM stick no video card.

219
00:12:28,604 --> 00:12:32,100
Scott: Yeah, I got a tiny Htpc, but it's got a 1070 in it.

220
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,666
Rym: Yeah, so I think I got a.

221
00:12:33,907 --> 00:12:34,630
Scott: I can play all the game.

222
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:37,030
Rym: I think I still got a 460 in the htpc.

223
00:12:37,151 --> 00:12:40,947
Scott: I play all the games actually a better video card in the htpc than in my desktop.

224
00:12:40,967 --> 00:12:43,158
Scott: because you know Yeah, there's some games over there.

225
00:12:43,761 --> 00:12:49,910
Rym: So in some other news, this isn't really news I just want to point it out because it's kind of funny and I'm surprised this is being talked about as much as they.

226
00:12:51,074 --> 00:13:00,241
Rym: But if you didn't see it There's this dude who basically complained that he did something with Visual Studio and it deleted Like all the code he's ever written.

227
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:01,769
Scott: I know this is weird cuz just the you know.

228
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:17,050
Scott: Well a while ago we were talking about someone who was like an intern or just a new hire or at something at a company following the docs to set up their environment and yeah leading the production database, right and You know, it's like we blamed the company, right?

229
00:13:17,652 --> 00:13:20,665
Scott: This guy's deleting his own work and we're gonna blame him.

230
00:13:20,685 --> 00:13:21,790
Scott: How does that work?

231
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:26,322
Scott: Well, it really just comes down to who was responsible for having backups.

232
00:13:26,462 --> 00:13:29,330
Scott: Yeah, their intern wasn't responsible for making backups.

233
00:13:29,772 --> 00:13:33,130
Scott: So, you know and he was following documentation, right?

234
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:36,279
Scott: This is someone who installed a piece of software on their own.

235
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:47,845
Scott: probably wasn't following any documentation written by anyone else Just doing things without knowing what they do independently One hard drive and has never backed anything up ever leading their own data and not having a backup.

236
00:13:47,865 --> 00:13:49,590
Scott: so they're responsible, right?

237
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:51,817
Scott: It's you know, just the circumstances.

238
00:13:51,877 --> 00:13:53,603
Scott: but yet again, we can't.

239
00:13:53,684 --> 00:13:59,163
Scott: I mean we remind people all the time But we can't remind you enough if your data is not backed up.

240
00:13:59,565 --> 00:14:00,789
Scott: You might as well just delete it now.

241
00:14:01,051 --> 00:14:13,279
Rym: Yep, if you're if you couldn't survive Literally reaching your computer right now pulling the hard drive out from the running system and smashing it with a hammer You're not backed up enough And you should back your stuff up.

242
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,640
Scott: Yeah, I mean like if you did that to me right now I'd lose data for sure.

243
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,574
Scott: Yeah, but it's not any data I'd give a shit about.

244
00:14:18,694 --> 00:14:24,486
Scott: all the data I give a shit about is it is a back it up very nice Caught fire.

245
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:32,164
Rym: My computer is up and running and I lost maybe a few hours worth of the work I'd done like in the two days before it caught fire.

246
00:14:32,586 --> 00:14:37,443
Rym: Otherwise, I was fine Mm-hmm, if every hard drive in the room, I'm sitting in now died.

247
00:14:37,784 --> 00:14:42,150
Rym: All of GeekNights is still online Mm-hmm and backed up in a couple different places.

248
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:49,677
Rym: so yeah, but in much more important news, especially considering the Times that we live in in the u.s.

249
00:14:49,697 --> 00:14:53,250
Rym: In particular iOS 11 is adding a very important feature.

250
00:14:53,391 --> 00:14:57,210
Scott: Yeah, so the thing that you know is like we talk about really good passwords, right?

251
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,890
Scott: And I won't lie the password to unlock my phone.

252
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:03,786
Scott: It's not one of those stupid swipey things like Android and it's not some crap.

253
00:15:03,847 --> 00:15:05,910
Scott: Oh four digit pin It's a real a password.

254
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:11,030
Scott: Yeah Which by the way iOS has a mode where you can force a real password to unlock your phone.

255
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:24,790
Scott: The problem is if you make that real password a password of any length of any significance You got to type that shit in on his iPhone Keyboard and type it in once in an elevator and the security company that works that elevator has it now exactly.

256
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,960
Scott: So that kind of sucks.

257
00:15:26,981 --> 00:15:28,870
Scott: So typing it is really annoying.

258
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:34,390
Scott: So what you want to do is you want to use, you know, the fingerprint scanner, right?

259
00:15:34,532 --> 00:15:35,930
Scott: So that you don't have to type it in all the time.

260
00:15:36,111 --> 00:15:41,589
Scott: The problem is at least legally in the United States as of today and we're not lawyers, right?

261
00:15:43,155 --> 00:15:51,653
Scott: As far as I'm aware They can't force you to reveal your password if they say arrest you and question you and I believe that comes down to the Fifth Amendment.

262
00:15:51,693 --> 00:15:53,849
Rym: yeah the Fifth Amendment and they can't prove you didn't forget it.

263
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:55,154
Scott: So exactly.

264
00:15:55,234 --> 00:15:59,349
Scott: but if you have a fingerprint thing enabled they can force you to touch it.

265
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:00,093
Rym: They can't.

266
00:16:00,214 --> 00:16:03,130
Rym: you can't say I lost my finger and I don't remember where I put it.

267
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:04,918
Scott: You can chop your finger off and set it on fire.

268
00:16:04,938 --> 00:16:08,955
Rym: Yeah that might wonder if that would count as Tampering or something.

269
00:16:09,055 --> 00:16:11,870
Scott: I don't know but I'm not about to chop my finger off to protect my phone.

270
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:17,910
Rym: It would depend on what I just done What I was worried they would find on my phone anyway.

271
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:22,545
Scott: So but how do you get the convenience of the fingerprint sensor, right?

272
00:16:22,585 --> 00:16:24,190
Scott: Plus it does add security, right?

273
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:27,570
Scott: I mean if you try to use the fingerprint scanner ten times my phone's just gonna erase itself.

274
00:16:27,811 --> 00:16:28,455
Rym: I just thought of something.

275
00:16:28,495 --> 00:16:31,430
Rym: actually one way you could do it make a rubber finger.

276
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:33,761
Scott: By the way, I don't give a shit because I have backups.

277
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:40,185
Rym: make a rubber finger pad That has a pattern that you just draw like an illustrator or something and then you printed.

278
00:16:40,205 --> 00:16:40,967
Rym: you use that.

279
00:16:41,008 --> 00:16:41,710
Rym: don't like your phone.

280
00:16:41,971 --> 00:16:42,874
Rym: No, you just know.

281
00:16:42,895 --> 00:16:44,441
Rym: just tear it off your finger and throw it away.

282
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:45,083
Scott: I don't know.

283
00:16:45,164 --> 00:16:49,285
Scott: But anyway, uh, So they're adding a new feature supposedly we don't know.

284
00:16:49,306 --> 00:16:50,010
Scott: this isn't for sure.

285
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:55,030
Scott: We'll find out when iOS the next iOS actually hits but it seems pretty confirmed.

286
00:16:55,492 --> 00:16:58,770
Scott: They're adding a new feature where you can disable the fingerprint.

287
00:16:59,011 --> 00:17:04,170
Scott: So I think I read something along the lines of like you push the power button like five times fast or something.

288
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,660
Rym: Yep, I got a quote here from a slash shot headline.

289
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:12,060
Rym: this presents you with the emergency SOS option Which you can swipe to call emergency services.

290
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,750
Rym: It prevents your iPhone from being unlocked without the passcode.

291
00:17:15,042 --> 00:17:15,169
Scott: Yep.

292
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,676
Scott: So you basically hit the power button five times.

293
00:17:16,696 --> 00:17:17,339
Scott: like what are there five?

294
00:17:17,842 --> 00:17:19,670
Scott: and now you need the passcode?

295
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:22,890
Scott: The fingerprint sensor has been disabled until you re-enable it.

296
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:29,410
Scott: So now you like you're about to go to the airport go one of your five and then don't unlock your phone until you're through all the security bullshit and on the plane.

297
00:17:29,531 --> 00:17:38,030
Scott: I feel like what then when you're getting when you're heading towards the customs in the other Airport go one of your five and So forth and now even if they try to search your phone, it's like good luck assholes.

298
00:17:38,292 --> 00:17:40,590
Rym: Now what I would really want is a step beyond this.

299
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,717
Rym: However, I realized that if they made what I want.

300
00:17:43,259 --> 00:17:53,369
Rym: a lot of people use iPhones would fuck up and do this to themselves But I want the option where if I put in a different passcode or like I swipe a different finger It immediately just wipes the phone.

301
00:17:53,691 --> 00:17:57,570
Scott: Oh, yeah, like this my real password and then there's another pass.

302
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:01,289
Scott: Yeah, maybe the password should be delete my phone and press enter.

303
00:18:01,671 --> 00:18:09,580
Rym: But what I do what it would do is one it should immediately log in to a like pretty generic Interface with no accounts blank iOS screen.

304
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:15,923
Scott: That looks like you just set up iOS with no data whatsoever And meanwhile while it presents that screen it is deleting everything.

305
00:18:16,184 --> 00:18:16,425
Scott: Yep.

306
00:18:16,686 --> 00:18:17,750
Rym: That's that's what I would like.

307
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:21,710
Rym: Mm-hmm kind of like in certain cut, you know, the thing is everything on the phone is already encrypted.

308
00:18:22,273 --> 00:18:25,610
Scott: So deleting it is it's it's like alright, whatever.

309
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:32,749
Scott: Yeah, and if you're not gonna trust Apple who seems to actually for all we can tell they seem to actually care about the privacy.

310
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:33,873
Scott: Oh, where was it?

311
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:37,085
Scott: I read someone they were using to help unlock the dude's phone.

312
00:18:37,105 --> 00:18:45,621
Rym: Remember I think someone claimed I have a proof of concept of Compromising the security coprocessor on iOS like a reason.

313
00:18:45,722 --> 00:18:46,725
Scott: anything is possible.

314
00:18:46,765 --> 00:18:50,633
Scott: But the point is Apple seems to care Even though there may be Vulnerabilities.

315
00:18:50,653 --> 00:18:59,262
Scott: I think we can trust them at least on this one aspect also based on the pressure They've been under I get the fact that they would develop this feature earns them credit.

316
00:18:59,383 --> 00:19:12,790
Scott: Yeah, right not they're not a hundred percent trust No one is but it's like, you know If you're not gonna trust Apple after all they've done at least in this one area You just I guess you just paranoid nutjob might as well just make your own computer with the soldering.

317
00:19:12,972 --> 00:19:15,008
Rym: Well, you know we talked about this a long time ago.

318
00:19:15,692 --> 00:19:21,270
Rym: You gotta trust someone yeah, or if you're not gonna trust anyone you're gonna live a real hard life.

319
00:19:21,531 --> 00:19:24,642
Scott: I'll trust someone who makes this feature and fights the FBI, right?

320
00:19:24,662 --> 00:19:25,104
Scott: Yeah.

321
00:19:25,285 --> 00:19:26,489
Scott: I'm glad this feature is coming.

322
00:19:27,571 --> 00:19:35,950
Rym: So yeah, but anyway things of the day.

323
00:19:36,311 --> 00:19:41,690
Rym: I think I've seen people tweet like panels from this comic before but someone finally linked me to the comment.

324
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:45,264
Scott: This is one of those things where it's like you don't realize it's a continuing webcomic.

325
00:19:45,324 --> 00:19:48,115
Scott: as you see it tweeted occasionally But you don't follow.

326
00:19:48,196 --> 00:19:52,896
Rym: I usually would see the one where this rabbits just sitting there and he's like, oh man What a fucking beautiful day.

327
00:19:53,137 --> 00:19:53,981
Rym: Look at that flower.

328
00:19:54,021 --> 00:19:54,624
Rym: Holy fuck.

329
00:19:54,664 --> 00:19:54,986
Rym: Yes.

330
00:19:55,046 --> 00:19:55,649
Scott: I've seen that one.

331
00:19:55,729 --> 00:20:02,750
Rym: Yep So this is the comic falls knees and it's basically that and I basically went through the whole archive.

332
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:04,859
Scott: I didn't haven't read webcomics in so long.

333
00:20:04,899 --> 00:20:06,224
Scott: I gotta like get back on that train.

334
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:06,666
Scott: you do.

335
00:20:06,686 --> 00:20:07,510
Rym: you're missing out on a lot.

336
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:07,974
Rym: I mean, dr.

337
00:20:08,014 --> 00:20:09,750
Rym: Me ninja like is completely done.

338
00:20:09,911 --> 00:20:13,064
Scott: I know I haven't had to find I had to get back on the webcomic train.

339
00:20:13,124 --> 00:20:17,861
Scott: catch up and you cover quest Escalated Come request in print.

340
00:20:17,942 --> 00:20:18,285
Scott: I've have.

341
00:20:18,305 --> 00:20:18,930
Scott: I have a bunch.

342
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:21,161
Scott: I have like at least three volumes that I've only read the first one.

343
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:21,865
Scott: You don't even know.

344
00:20:21,905 --> 00:20:24,296
Rym: like nightmare nights deal I have to restart it.

345
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:25,261
Scott: I basically forget it.

346
00:20:25,281 --> 00:20:26,567
Rym: You know what I could read the whole thing again.

347
00:20:26,607 --> 00:20:27,792
Rym: It's pretty good Order.

348
00:20:27,832 --> 00:20:29,658
Rym: the stick has been escalating rapidly.

349
00:20:29,678 --> 00:20:30,400
Scott: I'm sure it has.

350
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:33,329
Scott: I haven't read any webcomic in over a year, too.

351
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:36,458
Rym: What was the last thing you remember happening in order of the stick?

352
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:39,106
Scott: There was like they were at this like.

353
00:20:39,327 --> 00:20:40,410
Rym: is anyone a vampire?

354
00:20:40,511 --> 00:20:42,290
Scott: Yeah, the dwarf was a vampire.

355
00:20:43,551 --> 00:20:51,216
Scott: No, the dwarf is dead inside a dwarf vampire who was at the meeting of all the cleric, okay You're not as far behind as I thought you were.

356
00:20:51,236 --> 00:20:55,529
Rym: that's when I stopped reading webcomics, but there's good stuff going on in there now.

357
00:20:57,711 --> 00:20:58,201
Rym: SMBC xkcd.

358
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,317
Rym: Penny arcade today was actually plenty.

359
00:21:01,418 --> 00:21:04,265
Scott: arcade is one of the comics that I still haven't.

360
00:21:04,365 --> 00:21:07,226
Scott: I probably haven't read all of them since I stopped reading webcomics.

361
00:21:08,612 --> 00:21:10,483
Scott: By the way to start reading webcomics wasn't intentional.

362
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:11,650
Scott: it was just like an accident.

363
00:21:11,932 --> 00:21:14,070
Scott: Yeah, and now it's like too daunting to catch up.

364
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:17,583
Scott: But penny arcade will tweet like new comic and I'll click it and I'll read.

365
00:21:17,844 --> 00:21:21,158
Rym: so the one today was pretty good Yeah, but false knees is just cute.

366
00:21:21,399 --> 00:21:23,870
Rym: And if you want to see animals just just read it.

367
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,467
Rym: It's it's hard to describe why I find it funny.

368
00:21:26,487 --> 00:21:26,890
Scott: All right.

369
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:28,276
Scott: So here's a my thing of the day.

370
00:21:28,316 --> 00:21:32,339
Scott: is this trailer for a movie and I think it's an independent movie Or is it British?

371
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:48,176
Scott: I don't know where who's made it Doesn't seem like a Hollywood production, but it's a dark comedy about what a Rym's favorite not good people the style Joseph Stalin bad guy, so basically, the movie is about Stalin dies.

372
00:21:48,196 --> 00:21:50,185
Rym: Yeah, like in his office alone.

373
00:21:50,205 --> 00:21:52,592
Scott: I like the beginning and One.

374
00:21:52,653 --> 00:21:59,050
Scott: there's a whole bunch of other people who then freak out But it looks like an all-star cast.

375
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:08,790
Rym: It's like it's like the Arrested Development slash Curb Your Enthusiasm Slash best in show kind of it looks and the way the trailer is set.

376
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:11,603
Scott: It looks like the opening to snatch where they're like the Sun.

377
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:15,316
Scott: Yeah the politician It's like.

378
00:22:15,619 --> 00:22:25,550
Scott: oh so you got all these, you know The cast of characters all getting all mixed up because Stalin just died and somewhat seriousness But also mostly comedy.

379
00:22:25,771 --> 00:22:27,818
Rym: Yeah, I I legit laugh.

380
00:22:27,878 --> 00:22:31,430
Rym: just watching like half of the trailer like this looks really good.

381
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:40,218
Rym: It looks way good and bonus points for the fact that it is a movie made in English Set in Russia and instead of having everyone talk in fakie Russian accents.

382
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:41,600
Rym: They just talk like themselves.

383
00:22:42,711 --> 00:22:45,562
Scott: Yeah, no one's trying to do a fake Russian accent, which is nice.

384
00:22:45,642 --> 00:22:50,056
Rym: Yeah that counts for a lot, but this movie looks Real up my alley.

385
00:22:50,297 --> 00:22:52,606
Scott: Yeah, so check out this trailer.

386
00:22:52,626 --> 00:22:53,409
Scott: is the movie out.

387
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:54,857
Scott: Yeah I don't know anything about the movies release.

388
00:22:54,877 --> 00:22:55,863
Scott: You're gonna Google that yourself.

389
00:22:56,044 --> 00:22:57,109
Rym: I'll have to type it into IMDb.

390
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:58,476
Rym: I'm not even gonna do that right now.

391
00:22:58,717 --> 00:23:01,370
Rym: Yeah, so in the moment the booklet book apparently is still dune.

392
00:23:01,591 --> 00:23:03,357
Scott: So it's the fifth element.

393
00:23:03,417 --> 00:23:04,261
Scott: I started reading it.

394
00:23:04,522 --> 00:23:06,670
Rym: I'm on the nice website and it says book club.

395
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:12,800
Scott: I started reading the fifth season by NK jemisin on the train just now on the way here I'm in the prologue way.

396
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,439
Rym: I was gonna do that But then I finish.

397
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,090
Rym: I read the false son on the way to work.

398
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:17,492
Scott: You know what?

399
00:23:17,532 --> 00:23:20,910
Rym: I realize I read the other other story on the way home.

400
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:25,910
Scott: I realized recently I've made I found a way to make a simple but significant life improvement, right?

401
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:29,624
Scott: All right, I finished basically playing race for the galaxy on my phone.

402
00:23:29,946 --> 00:23:33,957
Rym: Yeah, I win about 66% of the time now.

403
00:23:33,977 --> 00:23:36,246
Rym: Yeah, and I think I can literally not do better.

404
00:23:36,346 --> 00:23:37,250
Scott: But anyway, I was done.

405
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:42,430
Scott: I'm like, all right I'm done playing race to the galaxy on my phone and I started trying to play war bits which is advanced wars.

406
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:44,360
Scott: But the problem is it's not easy to play.

407
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,170
Scott: I got the levels got more complicated.

408
00:23:46,692 --> 00:23:51,630
Scott: I couldn't play them in one train ride or one poop or anything anymore because they're real levels now.

409
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:55,060
Scott: Right, they have like airplanes and stuff and not even boats.

410
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,264
Scott: yet too much.

411
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,110
Scott: So and I'm like got two opponents.

412
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:58,829
Scott: Oh my god.

413
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:07,143
Scott: So I'm like, I'm gonna get a new game and I went through the app store to look for a new game And I didn't really see much worth playing even stuff that caused money.

414
00:24:07,465 --> 00:24:07,966
Scott: There wasn't real.

415
00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:10,493
Scott: and you know, I'm like You know what.

416
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:13,304
Scott: I'm not gonna play phone games anymore.

417
00:24:13,324 --> 00:24:13,947
Scott: It's gonna read.

418
00:24:14,108 --> 00:24:14,730
Scott: I'm just gonna read.

419
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,743
Scott: I'll use the Kindle app and set all those games.

420
00:24:17,045 --> 00:24:17,770
Rym: It's not a bad idea.

421
00:24:18,211 --> 00:24:21,945
Scott: So whenever I feel like playing a phone game just open Kindle app read pages.

422
00:24:22,466 --> 00:24:23,753
Rym: once it's so winter again I'll start.

423
00:24:23,773 --> 00:24:24,399
Scott: I can just do that.

424
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:25,610
Scott: I'm just gonna do that forever.

425
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:39,768
Rym: I'm done with phone games because when I'm not a police of the short time in my life rather than reading what I usually do Is listen to podcasts, but when I listen to podcasts, I pretty much listen to Pseudopod and podcasts like it like short contemporary fiction.

426
00:24:39,928 --> 00:24:42,760
Scott: Hmm That's not to say I'm not gonna play any phone or mobile games.

427
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:48,646
Scott: You're just only gonna play significant meaningful ones You know like yeah, like hey, let's play a Carcassonne while we're waiting.

428
00:24:48,666 --> 00:24:53,630
Scott: or hey I'm gonna play this war bits for serious or I'm gonna play Hearthstone, but I don't want to sit at the computer.

429
00:24:53,871 --> 00:24:56,205
Rym: Yeah, well playing race for the galaxy is just wrote at this point.

430
00:24:56,225 --> 00:24:56,487
Rym: So yeah.

431
00:24:57,671 --> 00:25:02,290
Rym: So yeah, the fifth season will be the book club book and well, I'll probably read it to and from packs.

432
00:25:02,391 --> 00:25:06,626
Scott: This is a soup a relatively new Super award-winning.

433
00:25:06,707 --> 00:25:15,529
Scott: Oh my god awesome book and the game won the Hugo Award two years ago or last year and the sequel to this book won the award this Year and the third one in the series just came out.

434
00:25:15,872 --> 00:25:20,749
Scott: So I'm probably actually just gonna read the whole series But we'll do the book club book after reading just this first one.

435
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:26,690
Rym: Multiple people who are already fans of this stuff have come out of the woodwork in the forums to be excited.

436
00:25:26,893 --> 00:25:28,050
Rym: So I'm actually getting more and more.

437
00:25:28,231 --> 00:25:33,110
Scott: So I picked it because it's like the biggest deal and the sci-fi fantasy novel world right now.

438
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:46,270
Rym: And now that I sort of you know My momentum of reading the prince of nothing kind of over and into me literally reading the entire appendix Like I know there's a lot of entries that are just men of the tusk died on this date in this battle.

439
00:25:47,036 --> 00:25:49,054
Rym: I read that entire fucking thing I didn't read.

440
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:50,929
Scott: I only read a few choice entries.

441
00:25:51,231 --> 00:25:56,030
Rym: So some of the ones that don't look like they're gonna be choice that are like a paragraph but they seem like a lame heading.

442
00:25:56,653 --> 00:25:57,477
Rym: Pretty choice.

443
00:25:57,517 --> 00:25:59,427
Scott: when you read I'll tell me what those ones are.

444
00:25:59,447 --> 00:26:04,687
Rym: Yeah, here's the rule Just skip anything that starts with man of the tusk because those are the only ones that are just like.

445
00:26:05,128 --> 00:26:07,477
Scott: alright What if it's man of the tusk and you skip it.

446
00:26:07,518 --> 00:26:16,441
Scott: and then meanwhile that second sentence was like, you know Oh cuz I read a journey to Ayana and because I read the ball Oh, you even read the man of the.

447
00:26:16,461 --> 00:26:25,334
Rym: the only one That was gave me any pause and I don't know if it was a mistake was that it did not list a death year for Confess.

448
00:26:25,575 --> 00:26:25,937
Scott: Mm-hmm.

449
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,541
Rym: So I read that I Really want to see confess come back.

450
00:26:31,702 --> 00:26:33,650
Scott: every other people who thought were dead came back.

451
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:34,453
Scott: So why the fuck not?

452
00:26:34,533 --> 00:26:41,818
Rym: and also conferences greatest moment in all those books is your boy was when nayer Bent him over his knee and spanked him.

453
00:26:41,838 --> 00:26:42,019
Rym: Yes.

454
00:26:42,219 --> 00:26:43,846
Rym: I'll never forget that.

455
00:26:43,906 --> 00:26:44,910
Scott: see good old spank.

456
00:26:45,352 --> 00:26:46,880
Rym: That was a real good scene.

457
00:26:47,202 --> 00:26:48,630
Scott: also met a moment, right?

458
00:26:49,071 --> 00:26:53,870
Scott: We if you're I mean you're either watching this on YouTube or you're listening to this podcast somehow.

459
00:26:54,131 --> 00:26:54,713
Scott: Yeah, right.

460
00:26:54,934 --> 00:26:56,541
Scott: That means you must really be.

461
00:26:56,601 --> 00:27:00,529
Scott: I mean that you shouldn't be do wasting your time on that Just like I'm not wasting my time on phone games.

462
00:27:00,691 --> 00:27:06,600
Scott: But I guess if you that's what you want to do You should know that there are other ways to interact with us on the internet.

463
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:10,680
Scott: They're probably more worth your time like Twitter Facebook Etc, etc.

464
00:27:11,572 --> 00:27:17,010
Scott: You can just search Google for GeekNights or search for GeekNights on whatever your favorite social media service place is.

465
00:27:17,352 --> 00:27:18,582
Scott: We're probably there already.

466
00:27:18,623 --> 00:27:22,481
Scott: We even have an Instagram That we only used one time, but we'll try.

467
00:27:22,501 --> 00:27:26,015
Rym: if you take you guys into Google at this point We're literally the entire first page.

468
00:27:26,136 --> 00:27:26,457
Scott: I'm trying.

469
00:27:26,497 --> 00:27:31,190
Scott: I'm thinking you know, it's like my instinct is there's a TV tropes article about GeekNights.

470
00:27:31,331 --> 00:27:31,893
Scott: Yes, there is.

471
00:27:31,954 --> 00:27:32,737
Scott: I don't know who wrote it.

472
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:35,290
Rym: But anyway, there's more in here than I expected right?

473
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:41,214
Rym: So one lazy person one sad person wrote we used to have a Wikipedia till that crazy guy Positioned to the.

474
00:27:41,234 --> 00:27:41,940
Scott: we're not notable.

475
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,928
Scott: So we shouldn't have one.

476
00:27:42,968 --> 00:27:45,477
Rym: Yeah We won the per sec award.

477
00:27:45,638 --> 00:27:46,622
Scott: Sure, whatever.

478
00:27:46,642 --> 00:27:48,150
Scott: That's not notable either.

479
00:27:50,512 --> 00:27:51,728
Scott: Got it here sure?

480
00:27:52,995 --> 00:27:53,709
Scott: What was I saying?

481
00:27:55,211 --> 00:27:56,982
Scott: Alright, I'm like, I'm trying to decide like.

482
00:27:57,626 --> 00:28:01,750
Scott: on the one hand I feel like if we make content we should put the content out on every possible channel.

483
00:28:01,811 --> 00:28:03,367
Scott: That's like sort of in what we tried to do.

484
00:28:04,055 --> 00:28:12,916
Scott: But now I'm thinking like hey Maybe we should do a content on this channel then a different content on that channel and not force people to follow us in all The places right?

485
00:28:13,097 --> 00:28:14,865
Scott: It's like well, let's do an Instagram live stream.

486
00:28:14,905 --> 00:28:15,990
Scott: Let's do a YouTube live stream?

487
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:16,854
Rym: I thought about that.

488
00:28:17,034 --> 00:28:18,380
Scott: Let's go fracture.

489
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,705
Rym: Like I don't know anymore.

490
00:28:19,726 --> 00:28:20,790
Scott: I don't know either anyway.

491
00:28:21,962 --> 00:28:28,870
Scott: But yeah The most important place you should go that's actually worth spending your time and not a waste of time is our forum Which is at our website.

492
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:33,210
Scott: So if you go to front recruit calm at the top of the page is a link for forum.

493
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:35,462
Scott: You could also just go to community that front recruit calm.

494
00:28:35,482 --> 00:28:41,570
Rym: if you go to forum for good I come you'll find the old forum that has like hundreds of thousands of posts that we have archive.

495
00:28:41,731 --> 00:28:47,570
Scott: it is read only but it is public and will be maintained like Han solo, but not unfrozen.

496
00:28:48,671 --> 00:28:51,701
Scott: But the current community is community our front recruit calm.

497
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,267
Scott: you can come and hang out there.

498
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:57,360
Scott: if you register It's gonna ask you to type in the reason you are registering.

499
00:28:57,741 --> 00:29:05,850
Scott: someone registered today and was like share ideas And talk with like-minded people early a porn spam bot something like that.

500
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:06,332
Scott: They wrote.

501
00:29:06,392 --> 00:29:07,598
Scott: that is not a good reason.

502
00:29:07,638 --> 00:29:08,804
Scott: that is not gonna get you through.

503
00:29:08,904 --> 00:29:17,062
Scott: someone else wrote something along the lines of oh Some people on the podcast told me to type something here.

504
00:29:17,082 --> 00:29:19,210
Scott: I hope this is gonna get me in and I'll get you.

505
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,694
Scott: I was like, yes, they got you in cuz.

506
00:29:20,734 --> 00:29:23,683
Scott: now there's no way that that is generic.

507
00:29:23,804 --> 00:29:25,890
Scott: Yeah, that is someone who clearly heard this message.

508
00:29:27,211 --> 00:29:27,633
Scott: There you go.

509
00:29:28,317 --> 00:29:29,925
Rym: So yeah, and our forums kind of rocking.

510
00:29:29,945 --> 00:29:31,010
Rym: so you go to you check it out.

511
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:31,950
Rym: There's cool stuff in there.

512
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:40,010
Scott: We have said this for a few episodes now and people took our words Heated our words and have joined and have thus increased the forums potency.

513
00:29:40,552 --> 00:29:49,863
Rym: So you can add to that potency by following and last and certainly not least There won't be much GeekNights next week meaning there won't be any Next week and maybe not even the week after.

514
00:29:50,124 --> 00:29:53,541
Rym: but there may well, yeah Cuz actually I'll be out of town the entire next week as well.

515
00:29:54,003 --> 00:29:54,264
Rym: I'll be in.

516
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:55,350
Rym: I'll be in Park City, Utah.

517
00:29:57,011 --> 00:29:58,097
Rym: Yeah mountain biking.

518
00:29:58,157 --> 00:29:59,203
Rym: so that should be fun.

519
00:29:59,585 --> 00:30:10,420
Rym: last time I went I Say I flipped over on a ridge and landed on a tree stump and got a bruise Size of like a softball.

520
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,145
Scott: This is the last episode of unique nights.

521
00:30:12,206 --> 00:30:12,466
Scott: It's big.

522
00:30:12,527 --> 00:30:13,329
Scott: I know the last episodes.

523
00:30:14,471 --> 00:30:15,234
Rym: Maybe one more episode.

524
00:30:15,254 --> 00:30:16,860
Rym: We're doing DuckTales on Wednesday.

525
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,888
Scott: Yeah, Wednesday will be the last episode of unique nights.

526
00:30:18,948 --> 00:30:24,044
Rym: So You know not gonna lie mountain biking is more dangerous than skiing, but it turns out.

527
00:30:24,064 --> 00:30:25,048
Rym: I'm really good at mountain biking.

528
00:30:25,088 --> 00:30:31,787
Rym: But anyway We will be at PAX West and Emily and I will be at also PAX dev.

529
00:30:33,052 --> 00:30:36,270
Rym: We will be in Seattle for at least eight days.

530
00:30:36,651 --> 00:30:38,940
Rym: Gotta be there for like six days.

531
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,350
Scott: I'm gonna get there Thursday and leave on Tuesday.

532
00:30:42,391 --> 00:30:44,239
Rym: Yeah, we're gonna get there Monday night Tuesday.

533
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,590
Rym: Wednesday is dev Thursday all day.

534
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:49,349
Rym: It's just all sticking around in Seattle and then pack starts the next day.

535
00:30:50,271 --> 00:30:50,794
Rym: So yeah, I guess.

536
00:30:50,814 --> 00:30:52,240
Rym: well, how late are you getting in on Thursday?

537
00:30:52,843 --> 00:30:53,184
Scott: I don't know.

538
00:30:53,787 --> 00:30:54,410
Rym: We'll check that later.

539
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:55,496
Rym: We always get dinner or something.

540
00:30:55,577 --> 00:30:57,970
Scott: I'm sure I'll definitely probably be there for dinner better.

541
00:30:58,833 --> 00:31:06,070
Rym: Getting there super late cuz we're thinking of it We might go hang out outside of the places We normally hang out like hang out with her own Jeremy or something.

542
00:31:06,311 --> 00:31:08,720
Rym: We'll see cuz we're just around all day and there's nothing.

543
00:31:08,821 --> 00:31:11,090
Rym: PAX dev ends a day before PAX West starts.

544
00:31:11,572 --> 00:31:19,570
Rym: But on Sunday at September 3rd at 6 30 p.m In the Hippogriff theater Hippogriff starts with H so you can assume it's in the Hyatt.

545
00:31:19,691 --> 00:31:20,314
Scott: It's in the Hyatt.

546
00:31:20,474 --> 00:31:22,806
Rym: We're doing the rage of the quitter.

547
00:31:22,886 --> 00:31:27,362
Rym: We're talking specifically Specifically about people who quit games at a butthurt rage.

548
00:31:27,983 --> 00:31:29,328
Rym: why and how they do that?

549
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:37,770
Scott: I think it'll be pretty fun All right, so we were gonna talk about this last time We did a Monday show, but I guess we forgot like a minute after we said we were gonna talk about it.

550
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:40,923
Scott: But we're having trouble with the Monday show ideas, right?

551
00:31:41,004 --> 00:31:53,430
Scott: It's it's not easy to come up with them partially because Like technology it's like technology moves fast But it's not moving as fast as it did and also we're less into it than we were before.

552
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:58,870
Scott: And most of the things that change are small like, you know Intel CPU increased degeneration.

553
00:31:58,870 --> 00:31:59,810
Rym: Well, here's a good example.

554
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:06,770
Rym: There was a time when which motherboard you chose had a huge impact on how well your computer worked.

555
00:32:07,313 --> 00:32:08,801
Rym: We are way past that point.

556
00:32:08,902 --> 00:32:10,310
Rym: It usually doesn't matter.

557
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:12,420
Scott: Yeah, the other thing is like, you know consider like anime is like.

558
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,038
Scott: it's always new anime series coming out I'm watching.

559
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:20,687
Scott: it's always news now It's always new games to talk about and the gaming show but it's like what it's like.

560
00:32:20,707 --> 00:32:22,874
Scott: there's not new Technology to talk about.

561
00:32:22,895 --> 00:32:23,757
Scott: the technology show.

562
00:32:23,797 --> 00:32:26,205
Scott: that much really it's you know, well there is.

563
00:32:26,285 --> 00:32:27,368
Scott: there was something it's like.

564
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:27,930
Scott: think about it.

565
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:30,454
Scott: It's like when early days of GeekNights It was like oh my god this.

566
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:34,070
Scott: iPhones now versus now where it's like the seventh iPhone is here.

567
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:36,680
Scott: It's different from the previous existed.

568
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:37,042
Rym: now.

569
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:39,150
Rym: smartwatches haven't changed, right?

570
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,074
Scott: So it's like they got worse.

571
00:32:40,316 --> 00:32:45,730
Scott: pebbles got all the other show ideas for tech We've already done and would come up with new ones.

572
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:48,137
Scott: So, uh, I don't know what's gonna happen.

573
00:32:48,157 --> 00:32:50,203
Scott: We might have to change we haven't Early.

574
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:50,925
Rym: I just wanted to.

575
00:32:50,985 --> 00:32:57,709
Rym: I was thinking about changing the format of Monday to and while it seems like a semi lame I know we can change a format to whatever we want.

576
00:32:57,749 --> 00:32:58,734
Scott: No one's paying us to do this.

577
00:32:58,774 --> 00:32:59,940
Rym: We've said this for 12 years.

578
00:33:00,001 --> 00:33:02,140
Rym: We've never changed the format of anything ever, right?

579
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:10,969
Scott: Well as the thing is like we're our original intent was to keep changing the format to find something that worked But I guess we're not using any metrics to judge what works.

580
00:33:11,451 --> 00:33:14,520
Rym: Well also man, but it's I've never even experiment, right?

581
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:19,120
Scott: So I think we're gonna just start experimenting with Monday because otherwise we got nothing.

582
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:23,940
Rym: So if you got any thoughts on our Monday show as opposed to the specifically Monday, that's all we care about right now.

583
00:33:24,021 --> 00:33:24,799
Scott: The other shows are fine.

584
00:33:25,061 --> 00:33:27,046
Rym: Then just let us know what you think.

585
00:33:27,307 --> 00:33:29,634
Rym: the best I can come up with is a lot of other tech.

586
00:33:29,654 --> 00:33:37,980
Rym: podcasts tend to just be Basically go through all the slashdot headlines from that day and just talk about them.

587
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:42,700
Scott: But I found that those people they just do tech news roundup only which is why I don't want to do.

588
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:51,759
Scott: But at the same time the main reason I don't want to do tech news roundup because Literally just makes us the same as every other tech, but at the same time I feel like we provide a very different.

589
00:33:55,962 --> 00:33:58,520
Rym: We're not Dvorak just not knowing stuff.

590
00:33:58,741 --> 00:34:01,069
Rym: Yeah, we don't know a whole different set of stuff.

591
00:34:01,249 --> 00:34:04,724
Scott: our tech news roundup is better than anyone else's but I don't want to just Do that.

592
00:34:04,764 --> 00:34:09,757
Scott: That's like we're just doing the same show everyone else is doing but at the same time I the format is almost just.

593
00:34:09,817 --> 00:34:12,871
Rym: it's like the Substrate just to give us an excuse to talks.

594
00:34:12,911 --> 00:34:17,286
Rym: what I've learned over the years, especially for the Thursday shows Is that he knows that it's tried.

595
00:34:17,607 --> 00:34:26,114
Rym: when we had a topic that was just an excuse for us to talk for an hour It did not matter what that topic actually was a lot of the early GeekNights.

596
00:34:26,135 --> 00:34:27,540
Rym: We never even got to that topic.

597
00:34:28,043 --> 00:34:35,659
Scott: Anyway, so I tweeted out today in the Ignites account I said tell us your Monday tech show ideas are well has run dry and people submitted ideas.

598
00:34:36,101 --> 00:34:36,504
Scott: So we're just.

599
00:34:36,625 --> 00:34:39,580
Scott: we did this for Thursday previously when we were dry on Thursday.

600
00:34:39,681 --> 00:34:42,407
Scott: We are still sort of dry on Thursday But not as dry as Monday.

601
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:44,739
Rym: Thursday's gonna pick up because there's a lot of movies and things.

602
00:34:45,482 --> 00:34:48,210
Scott: But we did an episode like this for Thursday before.

603
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:53,005
Scott: we just went down a list of Thursday show ideas and and basically Hit them all real fast.

604
00:34:53,025 --> 00:34:54,552
Scott: So people tweeted Thursday ideas.

605
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,094
Scott: We got a big.

606
00:34:55,415 --> 00:35:00,010
Scott: all these replies to this tweet I'm gonna go through but I just want to also mention some.

607
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:05,363
Scott: people sent in numerous ideas Like a few.

608
00:35:05,383 --> 00:35:07,652
Scott: like most of these ideas are from like three people.

609
00:35:07,873 --> 00:35:09,520
Scott: one person did way more than everyone else.

610
00:35:10,103 --> 00:35:12,398
Scott: That's a somewhat that guy thing to do.

611
00:35:13,682 --> 00:35:17,060
Scott: You should be sending in like one really good idea not a fucking course.

612
00:35:17,642 --> 00:35:26,099
Rym: If I say you submit one thing to someone and then you look and see that literally no one else is giving them anything Definitely then you fill the void.

613
00:35:26,553 --> 00:35:27,282
Scott: No Then you're like.

614
00:35:27,302 --> 00:35:30,816
Scott: that's even weirder if one person says a whole bunch and no one else is anything.

615
00:35:31,137 --> 00:35:32,745
Scott: at least we got a few People in here.

616
00:35:32,765 --> 00:35:33,348
Scott: Yeah.

617
00:35:33,609 --> 00:35:37,128
Rym: Well, I guess the other thing is a Quality forgives almost all.

618
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:45,820
Scott: so if those ideas were all good then all is forgiven Maybe but you know just to save time I'm not going to and also not to call out possible.

619
00:35:46,081 --> 00:35:47,067
Scott: I mean, this isn't like.

620
00:35:47,208 --> 00:35:49,340
Scott: I'm not gonna say if you do this, you're definitely that guy.

621
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,707
Scott: I'm just saying it's like that guy.

622
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:51,552
Scott: ish thing.

623
00:35:51,572 --> 00:36:01,011
Scott: if to do this I'm soft on sort of like someone who sends too many fan letters right into the fan club Yeah as opposed to the one tasteful fan letter, right?

624
00:36:01,373 --> 00:36:03,120
Scott: But anyway, so I'm not gonna say who tweeted what?

625
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:07,700
Scott: I'm just gonna go through the ideas and we're gonna judge them on their own merit and not based on the merit of whoever.

626
00:36:08,143 --> 00:36:11,359
Rym: I'm ready to type these into Google because you're gonna see how we do with the show All right.

627
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:17,720
Scott: So the first one was someone who doesn't I guess has hearing problems and doesn't realize that the fixed protocol is the fixed protocol.

628
00:36:18,001 --> 00:36:20,311
Rym: People in the finance industry don't know.

629
00:36:20,371 --> 00:36:22,440
Scott: that person wrote the fix-it protocol.

630
00:36:22,842 --> 00:36:25,914
Scott: It's fixed as an F I X for you know what it stands for.

631
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:27,300
Rym: It's a financial exchange protocol.

632
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,444
Scott: I thought it's interchange.

633
00:36:28,504 --> 00:36:29,629
Rym: No financial exchange.

634
00:36:29,649 --> 00:36:35,129
Rym: They use the X because I don't know what's the I. then Don't get me started.

635
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:41,715
Rym: fine if I financial Fi for financial X for the second letter of exchange because fuck you.

636
00:36:42,157 --> 00:36:42,799
Scott: It's not the fee.

637
00:36:45,342 --> 00:36:47,640
Rym: So wait that they want to learn about the fixed protocol.

638
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:56,659
Scott: Yeah, now I mean Rym really loves time with the fixed protocol That I am a world-leading expert on the fixed protocol.

639
00:36:57,022 --> 00:37:04,777
Rym: There's a fine distinction between Knowing a lot about something and enjoying the fact that you know a lot about something.

640
00:37:04,817 --> 00:37:05,699
Scott: the point is is that?

641
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,302
Scott: It's not really.

642
00:37:07,323 --> 00:37:09,652
Rym: I mean, what do we show it our show on?

643
00:37:09,712 --> 00:37:11,600
Scott: if we do a show about any protocol?

644
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:15,810
Scott: HTTP TCP any protocol you come up with right?

645
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:19,760
Scott: It's like as basically just reading documentation out loud at you, right?

646
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,930
Scott: There's really no point to doing a show like that.

647
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:24,020
Scott: There's not any opinions to add or anything.

648
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:26,014
Scott: It's literally just here's how the thing works.

649
00:37:26,034 --> 00:37:39,401
Scott: You could make a podcast Fucking protocol of the week and that would be a garbage podcast and people would basically Find the episode on the one they needed to learn about and then they wouldn't listen to it because just reading the documentation is faster And better.

650
00:37:39,742 --> 00:37:43,594
Rym: I think that would actually kind of interesting especially because I work.

651
00:37:43,614 --> 00:37:45,760
Scott: you want to make protocol of the week the podcast.

652
00:37:45,841 --> 00:37:46,365
Scott: That's all you.

653
00:37:46,406 --> 00:37:47,980
Rym: why don't we do a Monday show on API's?

654
00:37:48,267 --> 00:38:00,740
Rym: I Got a lot of opinions about like like soap versus rest and all the different ways people make API's and like how they serialize data and help some things do it well if something's do a poorly is

655
00:38:01,222 --> 00:38:01,524
Scott: Example

656
00:38:01,544 --> 00:38:02,087
Rym: of that's like

657
00:38:02,127 --> 00:38:04,400
Scott: that literally what Monday is and that's not it.

658
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:04,681
Scott: That's.

659
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:08,660
Scott: another problem is that is the thing that is very very poorly communicated with audio.

660
00:38:09,402 --> 00:38:16,504
Rym: Yeah, you want to realize without diagram, but without diagram, but I was just using text Diagrams would help a lot.

661
00:38:16,525 --> 00:38:20,523
Scott: I think anyway, the point is I think it's not a good show But I can.

662
00:38:20,543 --> 00:38:24,120
Rym: so I could do a full hour talking about the fixed protocol more more.

663
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:33,042
Rym: It'd be more like a college lecture though in the sense that even without diagrams or anything I feel like I could provide a sort of like the background like if like, you know The thing of this.

664
00:38:33,183 --> 00:38:41,996
Rym: if someone wants to learn more about something it helps for an expert to at least guide them toward The important broad strokes and like the hot the big picture of a thing.

665
00:38:42,377 --> 00:38:43,160
Scott: Anyway, let's continue.

666
00:38:43,965 --> 00:38:44,920
Rym: I'll give them a brief summary.

667
00:38:45,482 --> 00:38:49,960
Scott: So the fixed protocol is basically this ASCII string to get through a whole bunch of more right things here.

668
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:51,544
Rym: All right couple sentences.

669
00:38:51,725 --> 00:38:57,400
Rym: ASCII string format to send data between financial institutions or systems.

670
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,186
Scott: We're not actually doing these shows now.

671
00:38:59,226 --> 00:39:00,049
Scott: I don't think you understand.

672
00:39:00,089 --> 00:39:08,100
Scott: We're shooting down these ideas and I think it's fine idea If you go for an hour then do a show on it later.

673
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,791
Scott: We're not actually doing any of these shows now.

674
00:39:09,851 --> 00:39:11,180
Scott: the show is going through the idea.

675
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,454
Rym: Alright fine 35 equals 3 anyway.

676
00:39:15,622 --> 00:39:17,632
Rym: So the next I know the 35 equals 839 equals 3 is a joke.

677
00:39:19,582 --> 00:39:22,397
Scott: So the next one 35 equals 3 would have been a bummer.

678
00:39:22,437 --> 00:39:28,096
Scott: Joe Convention 101 how not to suck at registration system both pre-sales and on-site.

679
00:39:28,136 --> 00:39:29,280
Scott: First of all, it's not a Monday show.

680
00:39:29,521 --> 00:39:32,371
Scott: So there is so that second of all we've done that show.

681
00:39:32,391 --> 00:39:33,676
Rym: I would want to say that topic.

682
00:39:33,736 --> 00:39:40,619
Scott: there is a Monday Component and a Thursday component sure, but we've done this show and is not a Monday show.

683
00:39:42,182 --> 00:39:43,908
Rym: I think they're gonna be a Monday show there pretty easily.

684
00:39:44,189 --> 00:39:44,992
Scott: We've done this though.

685
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:46,498
Rym: Well when what what episode?

686
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:47,120
Scott: super wait.

687
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,704
Scott: We talked about convention so much.

688
00:39:48,765 --> 00:39:49,226
Scott: I'm sure we've.

689
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:50,470
Scott: just we've definitely just.

690
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:53,940
Rym: we've never talked about registration more than the technology side of it.

691
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,023
Rym: How do you load balance?

692
00:39:55,064 --> 00:40:00,240
Rym: How do you have systems that will concurrently handle all the people attempting to the buying part?

693
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,220
Rym: Yeah, that's that's that's how you can split into two the whole the Thursday party.

694
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,880
Scott: We talked about that, but it has nothing to do even specifically with registration.

695
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:11,820
Scott: It's just like have compute have enough computers for the number of people that are visiting.

696
00:40:11,941 --> 00:40:13,932
Rym: Yeah, that's an overly simplistic way to look at it.

697
00:40:13,993 --> 00:40:15,079
Scott: I that's all there is -.

698
00:40:15,139 --> 00:40:19,795
Rym: no It's not because you most of these systems care about the order that people attempt to register.

699
00:40:19,835 --> 00:40:21,863
Rym: so it can't just be Parallel.

700
00:40:21,903 --> 00:40:23,349
Scott: don't have a stupid system like that.

701
00:40:24,072 --> 00:40:24,956
Rym: So what do you mean?

702
00:40:25,016 --> 00:40:25,880
Rym: don't have a system like that?

703
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,083
Rym: It's just gonna be random.

704
00:40:27,123 --> 00:40:32,000
Rym: when people hit like the penny arcade whatever to get their badges who gets into the queue and who doesn't?

705
00:40:33,001 --> 00:40:34,689
Scott: No, it's just like and you go to the site.

706
00:40:34,709 --> 00:40:35,453
Scott: you buy badges.

707
00:40:35,493 --> 00:40:37,462
Scott: if you click buy after this sold out You don't get them.

708
00:40:38,306 --> 00:40:38,628
Rym: All right.

709
00:40:38,708 --> 00:40:41,220
Rym: So how do you deal with the giant load?

710
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,429
Scott: You have enough servers to handle the load.

711
00:40:43,449 --> 00:40:45,320
Scott: the people do the queuing systems because they're too cheap.

712
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:47,240
Scott: They won't buy enough fucking servers, right?

713
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,466
Scott: Just pay for the it's.

714
00:40:48,506 --> 00:40:51,380
Scott: this thing is up for like hours before it sells out, right?

715
00:40:51,621 --> 00:40:54,539
Scott: And if it's not something that's gonna sell out you don't need this to begin with.

716
00:40:54,821 --> 00:41:00,991
Scott: so if you're that big that you're selling out instantly pay the money to turn on because Thousand fucking servers on Oz.

717
00:41:01,171 --> 00:41:02,820
Scott: so you can handle this enormous load.

718
00:41:03,121 --> 00:41:08,620
Rym: How do you how do you how do you architect your thing to take advantage of that massive parallels and turn them all off?

719
00:41:08,901 --> 00:41:12,233
Rym: How do you architect your thing to take care of that massive load balancers?

720
00:41:12,313 --> 00:41:13,096
Scott: It's not a big deal.

721
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:14,260
Rym: How do load balancers work?

722
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,245
Rym: We've never done a show on that.

723
00:41:15,466 --> 00:41:17,095
Scott: I think we have done a show on load balancers.

724
00:41:17,135 --> 00:41:17,980
Scott: In fact, I don't know.

725
00:41:18,881 --> 00:41:19,304
Scott: That's a good.

726
00:41:19,385 --> 00:41:21,519
Scott: load balancers is a good show if we haven't done it.

727
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:25,597
Rym: Yeah, cuz actually load balancing is way more complicated than you probably think.

728
00:41:25,618 --> 00:41:29,231
Rym: Mm-hmm Like mmm load balancing will fuck up your day.

729
00:41:29,291 --> 00:41:39,490
Scott: But anyway and load balancing plus SSL Anyway Alright, so next next idea Iot, which if you don't know is Internet of Things.

730
00:41:39,972 --> 00:41:42,120
Scott: hype promise scary and reality today.

731
00:41:42,221 --> 00:41:42,967
Rym: So I'll show.

732
00:41:42,987 --> 00:41:44,379
Scott: the thing is internet.

733
00:41:44,547 --> 00:41:51,640
Rym: No Cuz I can answer the whole quest the whole thing And you always say that with utterly simplistic pointless answers that don't actually drive into the root of the problem.

734
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:52,700
Scott: They do Internet of Things.

735
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:58,220
Scott: So here's the only question is is a thing an IO device or is it a computer, right?

736
00:41:58,421 --> 00:42:05,244
Scott: It's like I could plug a toaster into a computer in which by USB or something in which case my computer is now controlling A toaster with IO.

737
00:42:05,264 --> 00:42:09,780
Scott: Yeah and controlling turn it on turn it off toast time or whatever the controls are, right?

738
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:15,540
Scott: And now merely I'm controlling the you know, the controls of the toaster with you know, a digital machine.

739
00:42:16,222 --> 00:42:18,660
Rym: No one cares about that semantic argument.

740
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:21,888
Rym: I want to talk about my idea of increasing automation.

741
00:42:21,969 --> 00:42:26,280
Scott: if I put a computer into the toaster is the toaster now a computer?

742
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:29,805
Scott: Right, and if it is continuing on that pedantic nonsense Yes.

743
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:41,660
Scott: and if the toaster is now a computer because it has its own computer you have to worry about like Updating it and all is I write bullshit But you wouldn't have to worry if it was merely and it's an IO device attached to another computer.

744
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:46,840
Rym: Nothing you said is the interesting problem the or the interesting question connecting itself to the internet and it's an extra.

745
00:42:47,181 --> 00:42:52,880
Scott: Everything is just like another computer connected the internet and that's not the interesting or controversial part from any other computer.

746
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,777
Rym: The interesting topic there is around one.

747
00:42:56,641 --> 00:42:59,009
Rym: There's the security aspect of how do you secure a world

748
00:42:59,049 --> 00:43:04,739
Scott: which doesn't matter if you don't have your toaster be a computer And you just have it be connected to a computer

749
00:43:05,523 --> 00:43:07,251
Rym: Then the computer still has to be secure

750
00:43:07,271 --> 00:43:09,641
Scott: the same as all security concerns for any computer Which

751
00:43:09,661 --> 00:43:11,348
Rym: have still not been effectively dealt with.

752
00:43:11,991 --> 00:43:15,057
Scott: it being a thing doesn't make it computer.

753
00:43:16,502 --> 00:43:19,575
Rym: Yeah, again, you're hung up on this ridiculous semantic computers the computer.

754
00:43:19,595 --> 00:43:20,640
Scott: There's no such thing as a thing.

755
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:27,567
Rym: There's a big difference between a very small number of computers or a very large number of computers Spread out among mass.

756
00:43:27,587 --> 00:43:31,000
Rym: consumers don't know shit about computers in terms of where and how you secure them.

757
00:43:31,641 --> 00:43:43,700
Rym: and also the consequences of that security are much more drastic when it starts to increasingly control things that affect your physical meat life like Say the hot water heater or the like shotgun that you tape to your door with a solenoid.

758
00:43:44,923 --> 00:43:55,480
Rym: But the interesting topic there is more around aside from the security problem The uses that are good or bad or how like say we solve the security problems and the ease of use problems.

759
00:43:55,983 --> 00:43:59,220
Rym: There are a lot of really interesting things that could drastically change our lives.

760
00:43:59,326 --> 00:43:59,496
Rym: Yes

761
00:43:59,701 --> 00:44:09,300
Scott: if all the things that you have to control and interact with on a daily basis can be very Improved by being controlled by a computer and not having to be controlled by your hands and your brain constantly

762
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,710
Rym: Yeah, and I think there's a whole topic there and there's a separate topic in the middle of.

763
00:44:13,091 --> 00:44:26,700
Rym: right now most Internet of Things things Don't actually do much and are more trouble than they're worth it's and their automation is counterbalanced by their ridiculous configuration Problems bad UX and in many cases poor failure.

764
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:31,820
Scott: This is why I'm saying we all of those Internet of Things things should not have their own computer.

765
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,466
Scott: They should not be a computer again.

766
00:44:33,566 --> 00:44:37,240
Scott: I simply be i/o devices controlled by the computer you already have again.

767
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:38,926
Rym: However, I don't think that is the question.

768
00:44:39,007 --> 00:44:41,978
Rym: Anyone's asking nor is that the interesting question and they're just.

769
00:44:42,118 --> 00:44:42,219
Scott: it's.

770
00:44:43,326 --> 00:44:51,947
Scott: By designating them as things Semantically when they're just more computers I think you sort of create Confusion right where there is none.

771
00:44:51,967 --> 00:44:58,148
Scott: if you just say like when people talk about the cloud if they just instead of saying the cloud Just say someone else's computer.

772
00:44:58,409 --> 00:45:00,579
Scott: It really simplifies the discussion, right?

773
00:45:00,759 --> 00:45:12,760
Rym: Yeah Well, there's a separate problem of like people who know technology on a broad and reasonably deep scale Versus people who have a shallow knowledge versus people who don't know anything.

774
00:45:13,661 --> 00:45:25,066
Rym: all three groups use very different nomenclature and more importantly the Implications of a lot of these words mean a lot of different things like normal people hear cloud and have a lot of really wrong Apprehensions about what that means.

775
00:45:25,087 --> 00:45:25,549
Scott: why I'm saying?

776
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:28,060
Scott: people say Internet of Things and they have a lot of wrong ideas.

777
00:45:28,282 --> 00:45:35,480
Scott: but I'm saying if you ignore if you Internet of Things means instead of your toaster being connected to a computer your toaster is a computer.

778
00:45:35,781 --> 00:45:42,783
Rym: But I would say though that you tell that you ignore the people who don't understand that and we trust that the listener is Intelligent out there.

779
00:45:42,803 --> 00:45:47,196
Rym: and we talk about the perspective of if computers control everything in my house.

780
00:45:47,256 --> 00:45:48,159
Rym: What the fuck happens.

781
00:45:49,522 --> 00:45:51,190
Rym: Anyway, cuz that's an interesting question right?

782
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:53,300
Scott: next one top X software thing.

783
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:56,029
Scott: You can learn to make money but be bored.

784
00:45:56,049 --> 00:45:59,300
Scott: fix protocol like board game protocol database.

785
00:46:00,465 --> 00:46:03,852
Scott: put of your mind in doing so.

786
00:46:05,021 --> 00:46:08,056
Rym: Fix protocol, you'll make a shit ton of money and you will hate it.

787
00:46:08,116 --> 00:46:08,900
Rym: It's so boring.

788
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,479
Scott: You want to make a lot of money?

789
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:14,799
Scott: You want to basically find a job that pays a lot?

790
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,244
Rym: Enterprise Java development.

791
00:46:17,425 --> 00:46:23,924
Scott: if you're good programmer job searches find a job that has a high salary and they're looking and they're only willing to Hire someone who knows them.

792
00:46:23,944 --> 00:46:36,520
Scott: a specific proprietary thing is it's not like top X. There's like a zillion of these things out there right each industry It is how many industries are there has some really specific thing that they use?

793
00:46:36,962 --> 00:46:37,625
Scott: Right, like?

794
00:46:37,906 --> 00:46:38,971
Scott: I'm sure it gets really like.

795
00:46:39,011 --> 00:46:40,538
Scott: I'm sure like, you know, how many?

796
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:46,250
Scott: applications are specific to like the pharmaceutical industry or the Manufacturing industry.

797
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:47,059
Rym: Well, there's the rub.

798
00:46:47,461 --> 00:46:52,359
Scott: I know any industry you can think of has some specific piece of software that they use that you've never fucking heard of.

799
00:46:52,519 --> 00:46:54,964
Scott: if you Are just a programmer You've got to learn.

800
00:46:55,024 --> 00:47:00,429
Scott: if you become a master of any one of those you will have a job in that industry for as long That thing.

801
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:05,531
Rym: if you're just a programmer You've got to be very good to get a high-paying job.

802
00:47:06,032 --> 00:47:12,500
Rym: if you are an okay programmer I'm very good or yeah, I'd say so or even a mediocre programmer.

803
00:47:12,962 --> 00:47:16,314
Rym: But you also have expert domain knowledge.

804
00:47:16,395 --> 00:47:17,800
Rym: in a non computer field.

805
00:47:18,302 --> 00:47:22,979
Rym: You will make as much money if not more money than the very good programmer anyway.

806
00:47:23,261 --> 00:47:29,600
Rym: So either be very very good at one thing like programming or be good at one thing and passively good.

807
00:47:29,841 --> 00:47:31,812
Scott: I don't understand how many tweets we have here.

808
00:47:31,832 --> 00:47:33,280
Scott: if we want to do them all we had to go faster.

809
00:47:33,565 --> 00:47:34,239
Rym: All right, keep going.

810
00:47:34,402 --> 00:47:35,314
Rym: We can always just stop.

811
00:47:35,517 --> 00:47:36,041
Scott: no We had.

812
00:47:36,182 --> 00:47:41,687
Scott: it's not fair because there's like a lot of the tweets at the top like the same people because they tweeted in groups And I'm going in order of time.

813
00:47:41,888 --> 00:47:42,150
Rym: All right.

814
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:42,974
Rym: All right, we'll speed it up.

815
00:47:43,115 --> 00:47:44,240
Scott: set up 2017.

816
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,907
Scott: What your GeekNights pipeline looks now.

817
00:47:46,288 --> 00:47:47,512
Scott: open audition push record.

818
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:53,451
Rym: Yeah, we plan 15 seconds into the future at most on gig night.

819
00:47:53,572 --> 00:47:55,560
Scott: open audition push record talk go home.

820
00:47:55,560 --> 00:48:01,559
Rym: I know sometimes the day we're gonna do a show on G chat One of us will mess with the other one to say what are we doing the show on?

821
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:04,209
Scott: Next one a review of Rym.

822
00:48:04,269 --> 00:48:04,954
Scott: So no speaker.

823
00:48:05,014 --> 00:48:06,040
Scott: I won that in a contest.

824
00:48:06,181 --> 00:48:09,177
Scott: I gave one away to a co-worker because I didn't need it and I gave one to.

825
00:48:09,217 --> 00:48:09,599
Scott: really what?

826
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:11,443
Rym: Exceeded expectations.

827
00:48:11,623 --> 00:48:17,862
Scott: It's a speaker that you connect to wirelessly, but it needs to connect via Ethernet like to the internet Can't?

828
00:48:17,882 --> 00:48:22,320
Scott: you can't just use it like on the beach or anything and then it plays music and it works real.

829
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,550
Rym: Well, and the speaker quality is really.

830
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:33,580
Rym: it only plays music though So it doesn't do any of the Alexa things of the Google But I prefer that as opposed to the Alexa thing that's listening to every word I say right and sending it to I assume the government.

831
00:48:34,361 --> 00:48:34,764
Scott: It's good.

832
00:48:34,784 --> 00:48:37,160
Scott: If you have a small room and you don't have a sound system.

833
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:38,466
Scott: The thing is I have a hat.

834
00:48:38,586 --> 00:48:41,680
Scott: my apartment has two rooms and like three or four sound systems.

835
00:48:41,801 --> 00:48:43,100
Scott: Yeah, no use for this thing.

836
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:47,080
Rym: But I did not have a sound system in the living room and it is like perfect for playing music while we're cooking.

837
00:48:47,602 --> 00:48:48,645
Scott: How to computer?

838
00:48:48,745 --> 00:48:49,046
Scott: good.

839
00:48:49,287 --> 00:48:52,337
Scott: You should just do what Scott do because I'm the best at computer.

840
00:48:52,358 --> 00:48:54,284
Rym: Uh Use computers.

841
00:48:54,625 --> 00:48:56,833
Rym: Yeah and use can actually try.

842
00:48:56,853 --> 00:48:59,060
Rym: when something breaks learn it like figure out what happened.

843
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:11,600
Scott: My number one recommendation is when you when you're doing things on your computer Do not customize the computer or the software don't change the settings leave everything as default and instead change yourself.

844
00:49:11,801 --> 00:49:13,667
Scott: Say alright, these are the settings.

845
00:49:13,708 --> 00:49:14,671
Scott: This is how this works.

846
00:49:14,731 --> 00:49:15,855
Scott: These are the keyboard shortcuts.

847
00:49:15,875 --> 00:49:17,120
Scott: Don't change them, right?

848
00:49:17,401 --> 00:49:23,078
Scott: Don't go changing your bash shell to some other shell say like Z shell or something it right say.

849
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:24,819
Scott: All right This is the shell I have.

850
00:49:25,643 --> 00:49:26,687
Scott: What can I learn?

851
00:49:26,747 --> 00:49:27,911
Scott: How can I better myself?

852
00:49:28,031 --> 00:49:29,718
Scott: What reflex can I build?

853
00:49:29,778 --> 00:49:30,260
Scott: what you know?

854
00:49:30,701 --> 00:49:38,114
Scott: I do to change me to make me better at this rather than trying to make the computer easier And that's how you get better a computer.

855
00:49:38,214 --> 00:49:38,738
Scott: That's what I do.

856
00:49:39,441 --> 00:49:46,546
Rym: I mean, it's hard because the way I actually am good at computers was computers used to be shitting hard to use and I wanted To play games.

857
00:49:47,089 --> 00:49:53,500
Rym: so I had to learn a bunch of stuff I hated just to make the games work and that by default made me go to computers.

858
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:57,220
Rym: So try to do things with computers anyway.

859
00:49:58,081 --> 00:49:59,767
Scott: Tech of Formula E racing.

860
00:49:59,827 --> 00:50:00,148
Scott: I don't know.

861
00:50:00,168 --> 00:50:02,457
Scott: It's a battery-controlled battery-powered f1 car.

862
00:50:02,477 --> 00:50:03,400
Scott: I don't know anything about it.

863
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:07,019
Rym: Wait, so anyone any showed any suggestion like that that the answer is always the same.

864
00:50:08,301 --> 00:50:13,040
Rym: We don't actually know anything about that and we very rarely are willing to do any amount of research for GeekNights.

865
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:18,380
Scott: So if we did that show it would literally be us reading the Formula E like Wikipedia page out loud.

866
00:50:18,601 --> 00:50:19,184
Scott: And that's not.

867
00:50:19,204 --> 00:50:24,046
Scott: that show would only be interesting shows if we got into Formula E Or if we had a guest.

868
00:50:24,147 --> 00:50:25,994
Scott: Yeah, that news which we're lazy.

869
00:50:26,014 --> 00:50:26,978
Rym: We haven't gotten guests in a while.

870
00:50:27,802 --> 00:50:30,572
Scott: Enterprise level software development slash management.

871
00:50:30,612 --> 00:50:31,957
Scott: What the hell does enterprise even mean?

872
00:50:31,977 --> 00:50:32,599
Scott: software is soft.

873
00:50:33,141 --> 00:50:34,284
Rym: no, I got enter.

874
00:50:34,304 --> 00:50:48,534
Rym: so I would say the definition of enterprise software is Very complex software aimed at achieving very complex like user experiences while simultaneously having extremely niche audiences and Necessity.

875
00:50:48,554 --> 00:50:49,720
Rym: Mm-hmm.

876
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:51,489
Scott: So what even counts as an enterprise is like a?

877
00:50:51,509 --> 00:50:54,604
Scott: well I mean, obviously there's no like big does a company have to be before it's.

878
00:50:54,624 --> 00:50:59,210
Rym: obviously there's no Specific line because that would be stupid and that's a stupid art.

879
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:00,709
Scott: That's what I'm pointing out is that it's stupid.

880
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:17,902
Rym: But at the same time the way enterprise software beyond a certain point on the sliding scale There's a point beyond which the complexity coupled with the small number of potential customers or users Coupled with the need for that thing because it's a very important niche.

881
00:51:18,344 --> 00:51:28,170
Rym: That's what makes something enterprise software and I Could probably talk for a few hours about that because I've been a product manager of enterprise software for like a decade.

882
00:51:28,671 --> 00:51:29,955
Scott: Anyway, adopt.

883
00:51:29,975 --> 00:51:30,757
Rym: There's a whole show there.

884
00:51:30,957 --> 00:51:32,582
Scott: That's a good idea of ipv6.

885
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:33,284
Scott: Where is it at?

886
00:51:33,825 --> 00:51:35,550
Scott: Why hasn't it taken off more by now?

887
00:51:35,691 --> 00:51:37,063
Scott: What would be the next major turning point?

888
00:51:37,103 --> 00:51:37,849
Scott: didn't we do this already?

889
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:39,870
Rym: I'm so long ago that stuff's changed.

890
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:42,078
Rym: but so when we're at RIT is the quick version.

891
00:51:42,439 --> 00:51:47,517
Rym: ipv6 was like a coming thing and I got space on the six mode to Do a project to like learn.

892
00:51:47,537 --> 00:51:51,050
Rym: our ipv6 works like back before and you know what happened to that class.

893
00:51:51,554 --> 00:51:53,429
Rym: I got bored and I withdrew because fuck it.

894
00:51:53,590 --> 00:51:56,723
Rym: I didn't care and I just died in that space eventually expired.

895
00:51:57,366 --> 00:52:02,745
Rym: and the reality is Ipv6 does not affect normal people at all and it never will it.

896
00:52:03,427 --> 00:52:07,785
Scott: I cannot imagine We've used NAT so much that ipv6 isn't gonna come.

897
00:52:07,805 --> 00:52:11,178
Rym: Well, no, it's just that Normal people in your house.

898
00:52:11,279 --> 00:52:13,729
Rym: It doesn't matter how IPs are assigned.

899
00:52:14,574 --> 00:52:15,430
Scott: Oh, yeah It's true.

900
00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:20,407
Scott: If your ISP just switched to ipv6 and it rolled out you wouldn't even know all the technology that you have supports it.

901
00:52:20,728 --> 00:52:22,180
Scott: windows supports It max supports that.

902
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:22,989
Scott: your router supports it.

903
00:52:23,411 --> 00:52:27,489
Scott: It's a new enough router which it probably is because even in beacon we had routers that supported it.

904
00:52:27,690 --> 00:52:35,341
Scott: But more your ISP just switched you to ipv6 and all the websites in the world switched to ipv6 and everything You wouldn't even fucking know now.

905
00:52:35,361 --> 00:52:39,066
Rym: That's partly because there are some.

906
00:52:40,553 --> 00:52:43,092
Rym: We could do a show on that maybe someday anyway but the world.

907
00:52:43,112 --> 00:53:02,830
Rym: so the problem is I would have to do a little more research because the state of The back plane of the internet and like the way IP addresses are used in the way routers like the way routing tables are structured has actually changed a lot in the last decade or so and I'll be honest my Personal knowledge of that off the top of my head is out of date.

908
00:53:03,171 --> 00:53:04,536
Rym: So I'd have to do a little bit of research.

909
00:53:04,636 --> 00:53:08,350
Rym: college was a long time ago and the protocols I know are literally obsolete.

910
00:53:08,731 --> 00:53:11,280
Scott: Anyway, the next one the fixed protocol.

911
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:12,023
Scott: we did that already.

912
00:53:12,043 --> 00:53:14,110
Rym: I could do a whole show on the fixed.

913
00:53:14,572 --> 00:53:15,919
Scott: Actually wrote it correctly though.

914
00:53:16,301 --> 00:53:17,930
Scott: Ah, what is wrong with century link?

915
00:53:18,010 --> 00:53:22,250
Scott: I assume that's someone's ISP century link and why do they have outages every goddamn week?

916
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:23,333
Rym: I've never heard of century.

917
00:53:23,373 --> 00:53:26,523
Scott: I assume it's someone's ISP cuz your ISP sucks home and business.

918
00:53:26,683 --> 00:53:27,245
Scott: Yeah, why?

919
00:53:27,306 --> 00:53:27,667
Scott: where?

920
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:28,650
Rym: where are they?

921
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:29,171
Rym: I don't know.

922
00:53:29,191 --> 00:53:30,115
Rym: I can't figure this out.

923
00:53:30,175 --> 00:53:33,810
Scott: Why 50% of your IT outages are sysadmins making mistakes.

924
00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:34,574
Scott: That's incorrect.

925
00:53:34,876 --> 00:53:37,450
Scott: a hundred percent of your IT outages are sysadmins making mistakes.

926
00:53:37,450 --> 00:53:39,522
Rym: No, ninety nine ninety eight percent.

927
00:53:39,562 --> 00:53:43,099
Rym: the other two percent are legit Coordinated attacks from the outside.

928
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:46,173
Scott: the point is if you set your shit up You should you can.

929
00:53:46,233 --> 00:53:50,506
Scott: it's possible to set shit up to be absolutely impossible to take down.

930
00:53:50,526 --> 00:53:51,910
Scott: You just cost more money.

931
00:53:52,251 --> 00:54:05,807
Scott: So if it goes down and you didn't it's either because a it wasn't worth Keeping that thing up in the face of attack because it wasn't that big a deal like the nice website is not really protected From a lot of things because it's not worth spending the money to protect.

932
00:54:05,868 --> 00:54:06,230
Scott: it goes.

933
00:54:07,052 --> 00:54:12,570
Rym: If the website goes down at midnight we'll fix it like in the morning, I don't need to be woken up.

934
00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:14,130
Scott: Yeah, it's like cuz I don't care.

935
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:22,689
Scott: but if you have something that you actually need to keep up all the time it is possible to spend enough money and Build a system that basically is gonna be up all the time.

936
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:26,688
Scott: Now the other reality is that it comes that when's the last time Google search went down?

937
00:54:27,029 --> 00:54:27,754
Rym: wait We can.

938
00:54:27,834 --> 00:54:32,441
Rym: I think we could do a real Monday show on uptime Like as a general like uptime itself.

939
00:54:32,501 --> 00:54:34,190
Rym: I got actually I feel a show there.

940
00:54:34,551 --> 00:54:35,494
Scott: Anyway, we're modern.

941
00:54:35,514 --> 00:54:36,898
Scott: tech would be without caffeine.

942
00:54:36,918 --> 00:54:37,560
Scott: It'd be just fine.

943
00:54:37,621 --> 00:54:38,403
Scott: I don't drink caffeine.

944
00:54:39,185 --> 00:54:40,650
Rym: Uh, I drink caffeine.

945
00:54:40,931 --> 00:54:42,637
Rym: I feel like tech would be fine.

946
00:54:42,958 --> 00:54:46,330
Rym: But caffeine is just one of the many tools I have in my tool chest.

947
00:54:46,672 --> 00:54:57,488
Scott: I think that the the culture of It's possible the culture of Silicon Valley startup work crazy hours Might be diminished somewhat because those people wouldn't be able to work.

948
00:54:57,528 --> 00:54:57,910
Scott: those crazy.

949
00:54:58,010 --> 00:55:00,361
Rym: Oh, those people would just use cocaine or something possibly.

950
00:55:01,165 --> 00:55:06,570
Rym: I also feel like The like glorification of caffeine in nerd spaces.

951
00:55:08,071 --> 00:55:08,893
Rym: I've really cuz I've.

952
00:55:08,913 --> 00:55:12,382
Rym: this has been going on since like Mountain Dew since before we were alive.

953
00:55:12,423 --> 00:55:17,945
Rym: before there were energy drinks in office culture But it really picked up in like nerd tech culture.

954
00:55:17,965 --> 00:55:27,549
Rym: I Honestly feel like the reason that happened in nerd tech culture specifically is because nerds are too afraid to do real drugs But they wanted to have a little bit of edge.

955
00:55:27,831 --> 00:55:31,510
Rym: So they talk about like how badass they are drinking the caffeine to stay up all night.

956
00:55:31,710 --> 00:55:32,011
Scott: I don't know.

957
00:55:32,152 --> 00:55:33,495
Rym: I feel like that's where that came from.

958
00:55:33,616 --> 00:55:37,787
Scott: Anyway, building HVAC and why power losses result in so much heat.

959
00:55:38,890 --> 00:55:40,539
Rym: Ah I could talk about building HVAC.

960
00:55:40,599 --> 00:55:41,001
Rym: That's it.

961
00:55:41,021 --> 00:55:41,544
Rym: That's a show.

962
00:55:41,564 --> 00:55:42,590
Scott: I actually know a lot about it.

963
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:43,640
Scott: I don't know anything about HVAC.

964
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:44,649
Scott: I know how air conditioner works.

965
00:55:45,731 --> 00:55:46,676
Rym: What kind of air conditioner?

966
00:55:46,817 --> 00:55:47,822
Scott: the kind you put in your window?

967
00:55:47,943 --> 00:55:49,310
Rym: What's the difference between one that has one?

968
00:55:49,831 --> 00:55:53,750
Rym: So the kind you put in your window, what about the ones that sit in the room and have tubes coming out of them?

969
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:54,773
Rym: How are they different?

970
00:55:54,793 --> 00:55:55,598
Scott: Isn't that the same thing?

971
00:55:55,678 --> 00:55:56,986
Scott: only instead of sticking out the window?

972
00:55:57,006 --> 00:55:57,690
Scott: It just has a tube.

973
00:55:57,831 --> 00:55:59,746
Rym: What if there's one tube versus two tubes?

974
00:55:59,786 --> 00:56:00,250
Rym: What's different?

975
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:02,075
Rym: Why is there one tube versus two?

976
00:56:02,256 --> 00:56:04,344
Scott: If there's two tubes, one's in and one's out.

977
00:56:04,625 --> 00:56:05,950
Rym: So how does a one tube one work?

978
00:56:07,310 --> 00:56:10,543
Scott: It just instead of having it in tube, it just is in on the front.

979
00:56:10,844 --> 00:56:11,587
Scott: It's in the room.

980
00:56:11,607 --> 00:56:13,081
Rym: All right And why is that different?

981
00:56:13,122 --> 00:56:13,690
Rym: Why does that matter?

982
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:15,858
Scott: I don't know because you want to use tubes instead of vents.

983
00:56:17,003 --> 00:56:17,867
Rym: I could do a show on this.

984
00:56:17,887 --> 00:56:18,470
Rym: That's another one too.

985
00:56:18,751 --> 00:56:19,293
Scott: I'm not.

986
00:56:19,314 --> 00:56:20,902
Scott: I don't know anything about air conditioning.

987
00:56:20,942 --> 00:56:22,330
Scott: I'd end up reading the Wikipedia page about it.

988
00:56:22,330 --> 00:56:23,859
Rym: All right, let's see HVAC and uptime.

989
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:24,986
Scott: We're not talking about this anymore.

990
00:56:25,006 --> 00:56:28,260
Scott: We're moving on SSO, I assume that means single sign-on.

991
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:29,366
Scott: I'm like.

992
00:56:29,406 --> 00:56:31,537
Rym: so my god I've been dealing with single sign-on.

993
00:56:31,959 --> 00:56:34,130
Scott: You have you basically have one system.

994
00:56:34,210 --> 00:56:40,514
Scott: Just that does logging in and the logging out and then all the other systems instead of having their own logins and logouts talk to That system.

995
00:56:40,856 --> 00:56:43,110
Scott: that's how you can log in with Google on a different site.

996
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:43,772
Scott: That isn't Google.

997
00:56:44,013 --> 00:56:47,064
Rym: Single sign-on is actually a pretty complex topic.

998
00:56:47,224 --> 00:56:54,879
Scott: That uses OAuth when it's on the web but if you're doing it like locally you might use something like Active Directory or LDAP.

999
00:56:55,306 --> 00:56:59,581
Rym: So Single sign-on is complicated because actually it's been changing.

1000
00:57:00,704 --> 00:57:06,162
Rym: It's been changing a lot lately Especially with like websites and web applications.

1001
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:15,170
Rym: Yeah, like the on the high level like yeah It's really simple like you use credentials from one side and you trust those credentials to then let someone access another side.

1002
00:57:15,651 --> 00:57:24,400
Rym: but the details of how you do that in a secure manner is Actually really complicated and it's a combination of front-end development, back-end development, APIs.

1003
00:57:25,842 --> 00:57:29,060
Rym: That's probably a whole show, but I don't know enough depth about it.

1004
00:57:30,281 --> 00:57:31,163
Scott: SSL.

1005
00:57:31,424 --> 00:57:33,188
Scott: They're like SSO and the next tweet was SSL.

1006
00:57:33,249 --> 00:57:35,555
Scott: I think we did one on SSL.

1007
00:57:35,595 --> 00:57:36,216
Scott: We may have.

1008
00:57:36,798 --> 00:57:38,925
Scott: The thing with SSL Is that like it's hard to.

1009
00:57:39,065 --> 00:57:43,000
Scott: actually it's such a mess that it's hard to learn it for reals.

1010
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,326
Rym: SSL certificates July 27th of 2009.

1011
00:57:45,326 --> 00:57:49,820
Rym: Right, but it's basically you're just gonna read instructions on how to set it up.

1012
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:51,567
Rym: We might have had a bad opinion back then.

1013
00:57:51,587 --> 00:57:54,280
Rym: Tonight on GeekNights we talk about the SSL certificate racket.

1014
00:57:54,942 --> 00:57:57,229
Scott: Yeah, there was a racket where the people selling the certs.

1015
00:57:57,529 --> 00:57:59,555
Scott: Yeah, the racket is by the way gone.

1016
00:57:59,636 --> 00:58:02,643
Scott: You can now use encrypt Encrypt Anywhere.

1017
00:58:02,723 --> 00:58:03,204
Scott: What's it called?

1018
00:58:03,445 --> 00:58:03,967
Rym: Oh, yeah.

1019
00:58:04,448 --> 00:58:05,030
Scott: Let's Encrypt.

1020
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:05,713
Scott: That's the site.

1021
00:58:05,733 --> 00:58:11,733
Rym: I feel like because of really Shitty use of those certificates that increasingly people are gonna distrust them.

1022
00:58:12,055 --> 00:58:13,540
Scott: You think Let's Encrypt is gonna get distrusted?

1023
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:15,668
Rym: I think Let's Encrypt is gonna get distrusted.

1024
00:58:15,768 --> 00:58:17,315
Scott: I think Let's Encrypt is actually legit.

1025
00:58:17,657 --> 00:58:18,440
Rym: Oh, I think they're legit.

1026
00:58:18,681 --> 00:58:22,071
Rym: I think that people that there's going to be a tipping point the problem with SSL certificates.

1027
00:58:22,232 --> 00:58:23,335
Scott: Chrome and trust them.

1028
00:58:23,415 --> 00:58:24,840
Scott: So does Starbucks and iE.

1029
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:27,027
Rym: Just I'm leery.

1030
00:58:27,047 --> 00:58:27,790
Rym: I have opinions.

1031
00:58:27,851 --> 00:58:28,814
Rym: We could do a show.

1032
00:58:28,955 --> 00:58:30,260
Scott: The racket has been busted.

1033
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:33,974
Rym: We could do an updated SSL show because 2009 was a long time ago.

1034
00:58:34,476 --> 00:58:35,300
Scott: IT heuristics.

1035
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:40,740
Scott: Why you know before everyone else does what the problem is based entirely on your monitoring.

1036
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:44,010
Rym: Do we ever do a show on like monitoring?

1037
00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:44,553
Scott: I think we have.

1038
00:58:44,935 --> 00:58:45,940
Rym: I think we talked about SNMP.

1039
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:47,041
Scott: I don't know.

1040
00:58:47,202 --> 00:58:48,224
Scott: Ad-hoc networks.

1041
00:58:48,285 --> 00:58:50,450
Scott: I took ad-hoc networking class in college.

1042
00:58:50,831 --> 00:58:54,080
Scott: Ad-hoc networking never really took off because it's such a pain in the ass.

1043
00:58:54,781 --> 00:59:04,940
Rym: It's the best use case for ad-hoc networking would be at a convention But no one's ever made it work because you need all the devices to play games and like play ball.

1044
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:11,420
Scott: Pretty much the most you're gonna get is like the little airdrop on your iPhone and during a disaster and same problem.

1045
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:13,275
Rym: It's just a. it's a really complicated problem.

1046
00:59:13,678 --> 00:59:21,100
Scott: Anyway, Decentralized networks and how you can prepare for providing a network that's really difficult to take down for protests and the like.

1047
00:59:21,563 --> 00:59:23,619
Rym: That's basically the same question question.

1048
00:59:24,423 --> 00:59:28,301
Rym: So the pirate boxes that we remember we talked about a long long time ago We used to.

1049
00:59:28,543 --> 00:59:31,320
Rym: if you watch our old panel videos you see us like you can make mesh networks.

1050
00:59:31,441 --> 00:59:34,240
Scott: The problem is it's the physicality of it is so difficult.

1051
00:59:34,662 --> 00:59:38,400
Rym: All right modern pirate boxes are way better and they have a lot of embedded software.

1052
00:59:38,601 --> 00:59:41,820
Rym: Yeah, so you're not gonna make a mesh network that has a wide radius.

1053
00:59:42,162 --> 00:59:54,839
Rym: But you can spin up a localized Wi-Fi and if you overpower it You'll probably be able to do okay to basically have like a 4chan equivalent That's local right there for like organizing within the radius of that thing.

1054
00:59:55,922 --> 00:59:58,540
Scott: There's a show modern signal jamming solutions.

1055
00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:02,560
Scott: I don't know if you're talking about how to signal jam or how to avoid signal jamming, but I know nothing about it.

1056
01:00:03,121 --> 01:00:06,711
Scott: I know get a better and more powerful radio antenna than the other guy.

1057
01:00:07,273 --> 01:00:15,357
Rym: I know about that from classes I took at RIT and that knowledge is literally 100% obsolete in the modern era.

1058
01:00:15,377 --> 01:00:15,577
Scott: All right.

1059
01:00:15,617 --> 01:00:17,159
Scott: The next one is CRISPR.

1060
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:22,839
Scott: CRISPR is CRISPR could change fucking everything and that is that that DNA thing.

1061
01:00:22,899 --> 01:00:25,056
Scott: Yeah Yeah, I don't know anything about it other than that.

1062
01:00:25,076 --> 01:00:25,500
Scott: It's a DNA.

1063
01:00:25,701 --> 01:00:26,504
Rym: So here's the show we could.

1064
01:00:26,565 --> 01:00:30,785
Scott: if we're gonna do a show on that I thought for first I was like are they talking about The DNA thing?

1065
01:00:30,826 --> 01:00:32,460
Scott: are they talking about some startup called CRISPR?

1066
01:00:33,102 --> 01:00:35,959
Scott: Yeah, so I feel like there's no E in between the P.

1067
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:39,456
Rym: I feel like we could do a show on that but it would be almost like a tech transfer.

1068
01:00:39,516 --> 01:00:40,380
Scott: I know nothing about it.

1069
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:42,052
Rym: so no, no, we're what we talk about.

1070
01:00:42,193 --> 01:00:50,180
Rym: is the like our opinions on the implications of increasingly directed like genetic manipulation of humans?

1071
01:00:51,003 --> 01:00:51,324
Scott: Do it?

1072
01:00:51,605 --> 01:00:55,540
Scott: I feel like yeah, but did I point out haven't you watched Gundam new types?

1073
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:58,800
Rym: Yeah, but also haven't you read the Prince of Nothing perhaps?

1074
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:04,012
Rym: Novel genetic experimentation on all of our babies at the same time is not the best idea.

1075
01:01:04,414 --> 01:01:16,220
Rym: Listen, uh, while I You need to keep pure my natural stuff and just to regress to the me Nothing fandom is probably greater than my Gundam fandom.

1076
01:01:16,481 --> 01:01:20,802
Scott: Yeah, I believe the real world is closer to Gundam that it is to Prince of Nothing I do.

1077
01:01:20,842 --> 01:01:25,460
Rym: but remember also the fundamental problem of Gundam especially Gundam seed where that was kind of a big part of the plot.

1078
01:01:25,625 --> 01:01:38,000
Rym: is that the consequence of increased genetic manipulation was better individuals who are just better in literally every way coupled with Decreased fertility and long-term consequences that might end their race.

1079
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:42,740
Scott: Anyway, we don't need more fertility because if we're living in space stations, we need less people up there.

1080
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:43,404
Rym: Yeah, but we might.

1081
01:01:43,686 --> 01:01:52,757
Rym: the problem is that we don't have a pure understanding and Some traits that are beneficial might be intrinsically linked to traits that are less desirable.

1082
01:01:52,777 --> 01:02:00,759
Rym: election pressure on there yeah, but I'm saying it's a very complex thing and we are not smart enough to grasp it and I feel like we'd end up Doing what the Incroy did?

1083
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:04,651
Scott: Wells where does the water come from and how do they run dry?

1084
01:02:04,771 --> 01:02:07,360
Scott: poisoned wells differences between modern and medieval wells?

1085
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:09,603
Scott: Hashtag will it end?

1086
01:02:09,683 --> 01:02:13,475
Scott: well, this is because I wrote in the original tweet our well has run dry.

1087
01:02:13,776 --> 01:02:14,819
Scott: they're commenting on that.

1088
01:02:15,842 --> 01:02:20,420
Rym: I know a little more about wells than I should because we have a friend who literally digs wells for a living.

1089
01:02:20,681 --> 01:02:22,829
Scott: Yep, we could get him on the show.

1090
01:02:22,849 --> 01:02:23,792
Scott: He's got her too.

1091
01:02:23,953 --> 01:02:25,980
Scott: Yeah, it's basically a family-run business, right?

1092
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:31,420
Scott: There's two people that we know that are awesome nerds in California who have a well digging business.

1093
01:02:31,561 --> 01:02:33,269
Scott: They know everything there is to know about wells.

1094
01:02:33,691 --> 01:02:35,380
Scott: We could get them on to talk about wells.

1095
01:02:36,323 --> 01:02:37,407
Scott: Is that science in tech?

1096
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:38,833
Rym: I know I know.

1097
01:02:38,873 --> 01:02:40,820
Rym: I know that I know what an artesian well is.

1098
01:02:40,881 --> 01:02:43,770
Rym: I remember that from like seventh grade physical science.

1099
01:02:43,790 --> 01:02:47,634
Rym: I Just don't know a ton about wells in detail.

1100
01:02:47,654 --> 01:02:52,255
Scott: Mm-hmm Yeah, anyway, uh predict the future on tech 2017 to 2019. didn't we do this already?

1101
01:02:54,362 --> 01:02:54,987
Rym: Not for 2019.

1102
01:02:54,987 --> 01:02:56,075
Scott: I don't know.

1103
01:02:56,135 --> 01:02:56,699
Scott: Let's do it right now.

1104
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:59,327
Rym: Well, you let's each make one production for something in tech.

1105
01:02:59,368 --> 01:03:01,815
Rym: That'll be in 2019 incremental improvements.

1106
01:03:01,895 --> 01:03:04,182
Scott: VR won't take off Nothing.

1107
01:03:04,202 --> 01:03:08,660
Scott: that's a. I won't take off none of the things that are hyped now or they're all garbage.

1108
01:03:09,245 --> 01:03:10,697
Scott: we'll just get incrementally better.

1109
01:03:10,718 --> 01:03:20,766
Scott: and I do think that I don't know about Internet of Things, but the definitely be more computerization of you know Things that are not currently computer-controlled.

1110
01:03:20,927 --> 01:03:37,980
Rym: I think we're gonna see legit murders and big robberies enabled by Internet of Things security issues in 20 by 2019. and I think I Think AI will like really fuck up gaming and start to win all games.

1111
01:03:38,301 --> 01:03:38,703
Scott: Oh, yeah, I don't.

1112
01:03:38,783 --> 01:03:39,687
Scott: I mean I don't mean that like.

1113
01:03:39,748 --> 01:03:49,000
Scott: I'm like people think about the AI like in terms of like You know sci-fi AI or the Amazon Alexa AI that kind of stuff like no one wants to like.

1114
01:03:49,081 --> 01:03:57,080
Scott: I don't think people really want to interact with Cortana or you know fucking Siri or whatever that kind of AI I do if it's smart enough as bullshit.

1115
01:03:58,047 --> 01:04:01,239
Scott: No, I don't want to talk to my fucking computer I would be.

1116
01:04:04,241 --> 01:04:10,925
Scott: But machine learning in terms of solving the problems it's good at solving, you know The statistical learning which I don't.

1117
01:04:11,126 --> 01:04:16,020
Scott: I don't consider that to be AI because not thinking it's just statistical really highly advanced statistical models.

1118
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:16,662
Rym: I have opinions.

1119
01:04:16,703 --> 01:04:19,654
Rym: I'm not gonna get into now because we're running out of time making decisions.

1120
01:04:19,955 --> 01:04:21,220
Rym: I just read my problem.

1121
01:04:21,341 --> 01:04:25,140
Rym: I just read like three dense textbooks on machine learning and AI and I have opinions.

1122
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:36,740
Scott: But that is going to solve some problems and and also create, you know better solutions to things and Increase efficiencies in many areas that will change society.

1123
01:04:37,322 --> 01:04:45,344
Rym: I think specifically the kind these the types the list of the types of problems that machine learning solutions Can solve.

1124
01:04:45,365 --> 01:04:51,985
Rym: real expand will expand to a dramatic degree and fuck some stuff You think a computer can do.

1125
01:04:52,005 --> 01:04:57,060
Rym: it's gonna be able to do like I think any video game will have perfect a eyes by 2019.

1126
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:58,365
Scott: just maybe all right.

1127
01:04:58,746 --> 01:05:02,258
Scott: the Russian hacking scandal election related or otherwise.

1128
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:02,700
Scott: what's real?

1129
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:03,263
Scott: What's not?

1130
01:05:03,344 --> 01:05:05,359
Scott: who worldwide might actually be at risk?

1131
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:07,339
Scott: I don't have enough information about it.

1132
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:11,660
Scott: If I did I would be like making some money getting paid off by journalists to give them my good info.

1133
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:13,869
Rym: I could probably give a really good summary.

1134
01:05:13,889 --> 01:05:16,740
Scott: I get a lot of yes, but I know a lot of facts.

1135
01:05:17,302 --> 01:05:21,219
Rym: I know a lot of facts because I read about this a lot, but there's not too many facts to know.

1136
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:22,946
Rym: There's more than you think.

1137
01:05:22,987 --> 01:05:24,656
Rym: there's a lot of interesting information out there.

1138
01:05:24,676 --> 01:05:25,220
Rym: That's legit.

1139
01:05:26,061 --> 01:05:27,166
Rym: You just don't read those kinds.

1140
01:05:27,206 --> 01:05:27,367
Rym: like you.

1141
01:05:27,387 --> 01:05:29,175
Rym: don't read all the Washington Post articles about it.

1142
01:05:29,195 --> 01:05:31,906
Rym: Mm-hmm I got a lot of opinions on that.

1143
01:05:31,986 --> 01:05:32,729
Rym: I do show on that.

1144
01:05:32,890 --> 01:05:34,476
Scott: tweet this article.

1145
01:05:34,516 --> 01:05:35,380
Scott: It's a link to an article.

1146
01:05:35,441 --> 01:05:36,636
Scott: I'm pulling up the article.

1147
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,333
Scott: Ideal OS rebooting the desktop operating experience.

1148
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:41,036
Scott: desktops are dead.

1149
01:05:41,097 --> 01:05:43,084
Rym: next Desktops are not dead.

1150
01:05:43,124 --> 01:05:44,628
Rym: desktops have become a professional tool.

1151
01:05:44,688 --> 01:05:54,194
Rym: a desktop computer or a desktop operating system in 2017 is the equivalent of the toolbox that an artisan carries with them.

1152
01:05:54,635 --> 01:05:57,353
Rym: normal people don't carry toolboxes everywhere But artisans do.

1153
01:05:57,373 --> 01:05:59,424
Scott: yeah How does AI even work?

1154
01:05:59,565 --> 01:06:01,229
Rym: also Linux desktop like fucking.

1155
01:06:01,249 --> 01:06:03,174
Rym: just burn it all and start from scratch.

1156
01:06:03,255 --> 01:06:05,200
Rym: had Windows desktop is actually pretty fine.

1157
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:08,855
Scott: How does AI even work in a set of instructions ever be truly alive?

1158
01:06:09,016 --> 01:06:10,000
Scott: our meat brains alive?

1159
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:12,376
Scott: We're just a combination of senses solipsism.

1160
01:06:12,416 --> 01:06:17,094
Rym: next question Yeah, but there's no difference between meat brains and computer brains in the long run.

1161
01:06:17,154 --> 01:06:18,017
Rym: They're just technically.

1162
01:06:18,358 --> 01:06:19,945
Scott: wait wait I got a few more.

1163
01:06:19,966 --> 01:06:24,950
Scott: This is someone who's submitted a bunch apparently at Debugging device drivers.

1164
01:06:24,970 --> 01:06:26,177
Scott: I don't know anything about that.

1165
01:06:26,681 --> 01:06:30,300
Scott: I guess a lot of times you're bringing out the oscilloscope to see what your hardware is doing.

1166
01:06:30,842 --> 01:06:40,237
Rym: So in terms of the consumer side of that the last time I had to debug device drivers Was when I had some firewire shenanigans for some firewire chipset.

1167
01:06:40,297 --> 01:06:40,960
Rym: shit wasn't working.

1168
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:48,740
Scott: I guess I don't know if they're asking about debugging it from a user perspective Like you're trying to set up your drive or you're developing a driver for a piece of hardware you have and you it's messed up.

1169
01:06:48,760 --> 01:07:00,470
Rym: So on the consumer side, you know how I solved that I said fuck it I disabled the chipset that I couldn't get to work and I just bought a PCI Express card that Google said would work with the Device I had and that was how I debugged it.

1170
01:07:00,550 --> 01:07:05,240
Scott: Yeah debugging distributed systems It's hard because things are on different computers.

1171
01:07:05,441 --> 01:07:06,646
Rym: Uh, you know what that turns into.

1172
01:07:06,706 --> 01:07:10,100
Rym: we could do a show on debugging like how you actually figure out the root of a problem.

1173
01:07:10,522 --> 01:07:13,460
Scott: I feel like that might be a good start one and work the other end process of animation.

1174
01:07:13,884 --> 01:07:22,149
Rym: I feel like solve every problem I feel like but like I feel like we could do a few case studies and Like give some examples of like the kinds of tools we use anyway.

1175
01:07:22,209 --> 01:07:24,836
Scott: general fun uses for tech skills outside the workplace.

1176
01:07:24,876 --> 01:07:25,297
Scott: games.

1177
01:07:25,538 --> 01:07:29,190
Scott: Yeah Video games setting up a home lab.

1178
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:30,235
Scott: I don't know what you mean by that.

1179
01:07:30,436 --> 01:07:31,380
Rym: I don't do science.

1180
01:07:31,681 --> 01:07:32,163
Rym: Why?

1181
01:07:32,324 --> 01:07:36,342
Scott: why star Nick's directory structures are exactly the layout They are.

1182
01:07:36,362 --> 01:07:45,542
Scott: cuz some dude had an old computer and he had a directory structure And then they had to add a hard drive to it because they fucking ran out of space and they mounted that hard drive on Usr.

1183
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:50,260
Scott: so now there's bin and use our bin because one hard drive ran out of space and then they had another fucking hard.

1184
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:51,845
Scott: Cuz that one ran out of space.

1185
01:07:52,026 --> 01:08:03,499
Scott: so they made it var and then because the everyone copied that computer They had the same fucking directory structure Even though they didn't made it more complicated and everyone copied everyone else and all the software is written and coded to these.

1186
01:08:04,602 --> 01:08:11,360
Rym: The Unix file system is literally people doing what people before them did because they assume that that's a standard for some good reason.

1187
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:21,992
Scott: now It is and there are Linux distributions that fix it and give you like that directory structures that make perfect sense and use English words like slash software slash home directory slash, you know, whatever.

1188
01:08:22,011 --> 01:08:26,578
Scott: but No one uses that shit and you're gonna have a lot of annoyances if you try to use it.

1189
01:08:27,060 --> 01:08:34,066
Rym: But at the same time I have annoyances using it because a lot of software doesn't play nice in that space Like especially enterprise software.

1190
01:08:34,407 --> 01:08:38,578
Rym: usually just install that in like opt because it's monolithic and it needs its own shit.

1191
01:08:38,599 --> 01:08:45,060
Scott: all together All right phone app updates your go-to Twitter verse tweet bot and bullshit likes in timeline.

1192
01:08:45,301 --> 01:08:48,010
Rym: So I guess I don't know what the good.

1193
01:08:48,029 --> 01:08:48,492
Rym: what a good.

1194
01:08:48,551 --> 01:08:49,676
Rym: third-party Twitter app.

1195
01:08:49,736 --> 01:08:50,840
Scott: I use tweet bot is great.

1196
