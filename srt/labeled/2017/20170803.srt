00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:14,170
Rym: It's Thursday August 3rd 2017 I'm Rym I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights' night.

2
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,653
Rym: We're talking about a big bike ride.

3
00:00:15,693 --> 00:00:20,019
Rym: We did upstate the Harlem Valley rail ride biking.

4
00:00:23,122 --> 00:00:24,137
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:27,383 --> 00:00:36,462
Scott: So my work has been like you know officially we get free breakfast every other Thursday, but I guess Unofficially, but anyway we seem to get on the.

6
00:00:36,683 --> 00:00:40,718
Scott: on the Thursdays where there's no breakfast We're getting free lunch, and the lunch is always from somewhere different.

7
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:44,330
Scott: so today the lunch was free barbecue.

8
00:00:45,134 --> 00:00:45,978
Rym: Oh from where?

9
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:48,230
Scott: from crabby old Dallas barbecue.

10
00:00:49,634 --> 00:00:58,710
Scott: And this place is not the worst But I mean it's one of those things where it's like They brought in this food, and if I was gonna go to a barbecue place I would never go there pretty much ever.

11
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:00,570
Scott: There's no reason to be to ever go to that place.

12
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:04,724
Rym: But I went there like once or twice in my life for zero dollars.

13
00:01:05,224 --> 00:01:06,008
Scott: zero money.

14
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:06,650
Rym: for zero money.

15
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,676
Rym: I'll eat some barbecue chicken and cornbread right?

16
00:01:08,917 --> 00:01:10,201
Scott: I got fried chicken.

17
00:01:10,602 --> 00:01:11,565
Scott: I got rib.

18
00:01:11,966 --> 00:01:13,130
Scott: I got cornbread.

19
00:01:13,391 --> 00:01:14,114
Scott: I got bean.

20
00:01:14,335 --> 00:01:15,018
Scott: I got shrimp.

21
00:01:15,058 --> 00:01:20,648
Scott: you got beans and cornbread shrimp ease And then there were even salads that no one ate.

22
00:01:22,911 --> 00:01:24,496
Scott: It's like there was so much food.

23
00:01:24,556 --> 00:01:25,198
Scott: It was crazy.

24
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:28,749
Scott: It's like I had to use like three wipey things on my fingers.

25
00:01:30,255 --> 00:01:36,730
Scott: For dessert I'm gonna eat vegetable And for breakfast tomorrow probably gonna eat nothing.

26
00:01:37,434 --> 00:01:38,339
Rym: I basically skipped lunch.

27
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:49,070
Rym: just cuz I wasn't super hungry cuz I had a big dinner and I like haven't done enough exercise since the bike ride, but Because of that I was so hungry when I came home that I ate an entire ice cream sandwich like right before you arrived.

28
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:56,290
Scott: Great yeah, but uh it was interesting to see like what different people chose to eat from the barbecue.

29
00:01:57,191 --> 00:02:07,037
Scott: Like a lot of people were taking the fried chicken covered in buffalo sauce which was not looking great Whereas I took the.

30
00:02:07,058 --> 00:02:09,150
Scott: you know they were the messy kind of ribs.

31
00:02:09,314 --> 00:02:10,955
Scott: Yeah But it's like you know.

32
00:02:10,996 --> 00:02:17,250
Scott: some people were like sitting there with a plastic knife trying to like cut off one rib And I'm like no no no no no I just grabbed the whole.

33
00:02:17,914 --> 00:02:18,377
Scott: They were like.

34
00:02:18,477 --> 00:02:19,604
Scott: you know they were like set.

35
00:02:19,624 --> 00:02:20,530
Scott: they were already pre-cut.

36
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:23,270
Scott: It's like you know sets of like four rib four rib four rib.

37
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:24,055
Rym: So you take four.

38
00:02:24,075 --> 00:02:26,490
Rym: you just tear it apart with your hands and shove it into your maw.

39
00:02:26,711 --> 00:02:27,174
Scott: I had to make.

40
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:30,190
Scott: I was very difficult at my desk trying to like not touch my keyboard.

41
00:02:31,371 --> 00:02:37,728
Scott: Cuz how often you eat barbecue at a desk with keyboard and a mouse yep And then the whole office smelled like barbecue sauce.

42
00:02:38,472 --> 00:02:40,197
Rym: The problem is having just read that person nothing.

43
00:02:40,237 --> 00:02:44,390
Rym: all I can think about is like the grease on my fingers and getting everywhere.

44
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,154
Rym: Mmm, cuz that grease.

45
00:02:46,535 --> 00:02:47,458
Rym: yeah bad news.

46
00:02:47,538 --> 00:02:47,900
Scott: We'll see.

47
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,407
Scott: we'll see what we get for lunch two weeks from now.

48
00:02:50,488 --> 00:02:53,478
Rym: Yeah yeah, my actually worry is turns cuz my company.

49
00:02:53,518 --> 00:03:09,630
Rym: we moved offices to the fashion district and like 7th Avenue and And It's like we're a software company and literally everyone else in our fancy building is a fashion company with like Designers on max designing dresses and things get some dresses.

50
00:03:09,811 --> 00:03:12,283
Rym: I'm getting a lot of weird looks from people like the kinds of conversations.

51
00:03:12,303 --> 00:03:14,876
Rym: We have in the hallway and It's just.

52
00:03:14,917 --> 00:03:16,230
Rym: it's interesting to be in that building.

53
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,070
Rym: I think we're literally the only non-fashion company in this gigantic.

54
00:03:19,531 --> 00:03:20,113
Scott: Is that place?

55
00:03:20,153 --> 00:03:21,738
Scott: then cuz plus.

56
00:03:21,778 --> 00:03:25,810
Scott: I think if you're a fashion company in that building you get like tax breaks or so from what?

57
00:03:26,894 --> 00:03:27,119
Rym: Being

58
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:28,040
Scott: in particular I don't

59
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:35,188
Rym: know anything I don't know for sure but I heard cuz I you know I overheard all the stuff about setting this office up that a lot of those incentives are going away or went

60
00:03:35,249 --> 00:03:35,510
Scott: away

61
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:40,805
Rym: and cuz fashion like the incentives are not gonna be there like they used to be.

62
00:03:40,866 --> 00:03:46,350
Rym: so there's big pressure for Companies that are willing to pay a lot more money to move on to 7th Avenue now.

63
00:03:47,691 --> 00:03:49,740
Rym: But I don't know cuz I don't know a lot about real estate.

64
00:03:50,262 --> 00:03:51,889
Scott: So yeah, but yeah, that's the thing.

65
00:03:51,929 --> 00:03:52,533
Scott: people It's like.

66
00:03:52,594 --> 00:03:54,750
Scott: why did all these businesses go in the same district?

67
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:55,332
Scott: Well, it's like.

68
00:03:55,573 --> 00:03:57,579
Scott: sometimes it's just you know convenience like.

69
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,208
Scott: oh, there's the you know, I don't know a bar.

70
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:06,110
Scott: It's like well people hang out here at night So I'll put more bars here and then all the nighttime people hang out in this area.

71
00:04:06,251 --> 00:04:09,770
Scott: No, and then that's how we get more business by being all in the same area, right?

72
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,290
Scott: We make a red light district or something.

73
00:04:11,491 --> 00:04:15,747
Scott: Well, like look at you have a company that's like indoors like you're designing fashion or something.

74
00:04:15,787 --> 00:04:16,350
Scott: Why would you be?

75
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:24,219
Scott: What's the point of being physically near someone who does the same thing, you know, I guess deliveries and you know Well, also remember that district.

76
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:29,464
Rym: if you go to the side streets off of 7th Avenue It's all that like you there's all those shops that are little or literally just like.

77
00:04:29,745 --> 00:04:30,790
Rym: do you want to buy an entire?

78
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,357
Rym: Bolt of a very specific fabric.

79
00:04:32,377 --> 00:04:33,020
Scott: Well, that's right.

80
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:41,350
Scott: Some places like a wholesale place will be like, aha I'll open up near these other guys like all you know, this way electronics manufacturers all in Shenzhen, right?

81
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:44,790
Scott: We're all near each other so that they can all get stuff from each other.

82
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,190
Scott: I'm putting together a circuit board.

83
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:55,050
Scott: I can go to the guy who makes Ram and I can go to the guy who make course even look like it in our Right here, there's two bouldering gyms like a few blocks from each other.

84
00:04:55,050 --> 00:05:00,250
Rym: That makes no sense because they're just competing with each other except the thing is they're both completely full like over capacity.

85
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,596
Scott: I guess the demand is just too high.

86
00:05:01,616 --> 00:05:05,070
Rym: you could probably build two more bouldering gyms here and they'd also be a capacity.

87
00:05:05,251 --> 00:05:10,790
Scott: Anyway, the point is there was actually in the in the district the fashion district at least as well as many others.

88
00:05:11,191 --> 00:05:21,430
Scott: They specifically give tax breaks and other, you know incentives to be there And that's what creates the district in the first like the diamond district and all these.

89
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:34,030
Scott: I don't know if the diamond district is that way but the fashion district there definitely were some kind of like, you know incentives Financially, like if you're making a fashion company and you you've put your office somewhere else.

90
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,158
Scott: Yeah, you're gonna be losing money.

91
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,810
Scott: The only thing that's driving up free money.

92
00:05:37,192 --> 00:05:46,247
Scott: I'm not the most fashionable dresser, but I'm far from the Kilt and the toe shoe guy is not an and floppy old man hat is not the most fashionable.

93
00:05:46,407 --> 00:05:50,758
Scott: Hawaiian shirt is Concede you don't set really.

94
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:51,200
Scott: I didn't know.

95
00:05:51,221 --> 00:05:55,609
Scott: I thought that that was like peak like Like the height of all fashion.

96
00:05:57,015 --> 00:06:01,049
Rym: I am NOT the bottom either because we have seen the bottoms.

97
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:07,910
Scott: Well your clothes are at least washed when they're when you leave the house, but also I don't dress that way like for work.

98
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:11,811
Rym: I'm usually wearing like a decent collared shirt like a Henley or something Like.

99
00:06:11,831 --> 00:06:12,976
Rym: I dress up a little nicer.

100
00:06:13,116 --> 00:06:16,590
Rym: usually though if I bike to work, I'm just in like biking gear because who cares?

101
00:06:17,553 --> 00:06:24,614
Rym: but Pretty much everyone in this building who doesn't work for my company is like fashionable to the point that you're like well, like you.

102
00:06:24,654 --> 00:06:28,789
Rym: look at him like wow and Everyone is like that in this building.

103
00:06:29,331 --> 00:06:40,300
Rym: literally everyone dude walked in and this dude was wearing like stiletto heels and He had like these sort of tight jeans that cropped short and then he had a jacket like a sport coat and a Henley.

104
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,588
Rym: That's what he had on and that sounds crazy.

105
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:44,555
Rym: If I tried to wear that I look like a moron.

106
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,060
Rym: this dude looked tight.

107
00:06:46,383 --> 00:06:48,078
Scott: Why don't you ask that dude like hey?

108
00:06:49,121 --> 00:06:50,550
Scott: You're like the most fashionable person.

109
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:51,979
Rym: I've seen make me like you.

110
00:06:52,702 --> 00:06:54,871
Scott: You tell me what to buy and he's gonna be like.

111
00:06:55,132 --> 00:06:55,553
Scott: he's gonna be like.

112
00:06:55,573 --> 00:06:56,236
Scott: this jacket is $1,000.

113
00:06:56,236 --> 00:07:01,172
Scott: You're like Like oh and you're like, why are you wearing it?

114
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:01,996
Scott: It's like I don't pay.

115
00:07:02,056 --> 00:07:07,013
Rym: yeah Because the $900 jacket looks like garbage.

116
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:07,776
Scott: He's like it's $1,000 for you.

117
00:07:11,184 --> 00:07:12,718
Rym: So there's some really important news.

118
00:07:13,645 --> 00:07:15,919
Rym: You remember the scary stories to tell in the dark books.

119
00:07:16,542 --> 00:07:18,210
Rym: yes, the ones that had that.

120
00:07:18,431 --> 00:07:26,117
Rym: pretty much everyone who was born between like 1978 and 1984 had these books as a kid and they're really like crappy ghost stories.

121
00:07:26,137 --> 00:07:28,063
Rym: Like they're not good ghost stories They're not even scary.

122
00:07:28,485 --> 00:07:34,726
Rym: Nope, but the art in these books was like Terrifying to kids.

123
00:07:34,827 --> 00:07:37,240
Scott: Well, this is black and white really creepy draw.

124
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:42,175
Rym: But it had like this really like thin line like creepy Cthulhu.

125
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:43,820
Scott: Did you find info about the artist?

126
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,999
Rym: No, I know all about the artist Stephen Gamel.

127
00:07:46,248 --> 00:07:47,785
Scott: Okay So the deal is.

128
00:07:47,805 --> 00:07:54,976
Rym: the books got republished in the 2000s and there was an uproar Because they replaced that art because I thought it was too scary with some bullshit.

129
00:07:54,996 --> 00:07:55,499
Rym: Mm-hmm.

130
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:59,094
Rym: So the news is and this was posted today.

131
00:07:59,154 --> 00:08:00,419
Rym: This is brand new news.

132
00:08:01,082 --> 00:08:06,440
Rym: They're finally due to hate like crazy demand from basically my generation.

133
00:08:06,961 --> 00:08:11,515
Rym: They're republishing these books in their original format with the original arts.

134
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:12,578
Scott: I just have the books.

135
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:13,180
Scott: like it's anyone.

136
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,044
Scott: I also have the book.

137
00:08:14,084 --> 00:08:14,788
Scott: anyone wants them.

138
00:08:14,868 --> 00:08:15,873
Scott: I know exactly where they are.

139
00:08:15,893 --> 00:08:17,220
Scott: I will sell them to you for money.

140
00:08:17,823 --> 00:08:18,608
Scott: Are they worth a lot?

141
00:08:19,352 --> 00:08:20,257
Scott: I have the trilogy in the.

142
00:08:20,277 --> 00:08:23,631
Rym: I think Literally everyone born between 1978 1984 has all those books.

143
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,130
Scott: There's three of them because we got them in the last.

144
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:30,080
Scott: they're gonna be released on the Kindle or something now.

145
00:08:31,325 --> 00:08:33,100
Scott: But I feel I'm not gonna buy them or read them.

146
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,630
Scott: But I feel like I would gladly sell my old ones for money.

147
00:08:35,831 --> 00:08:41,859
Rym: if I were ever going to make a horror video game I would hire this artist like him no matter what at any cost.

148
00:08:43,101 --> 00:08:46,600
Rym: Cuz these books like the art is what made them great.

149
00:08:47,503 --> 00:08:48,209
Rym: I was terrified.

150
00:08:48,229 --> 00:09:00,771
Rym: the one in particular in the first one Harold that story the one I got a fear on the screen that probably scared me the most as a kid because I had a wrestling buddy and I also had a my buddy and I was afraid between this this and child play that they'd Wake up and kill me one day.

151
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:11,380
Rym: Mm-hmm and I was a for there's one page in the first one where you're like you're reading this story and you turn the page and On the inside page when it comes around there's rotted skull lady.

152
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:14,380
Rym: And I did and the problem was because I turned the page.

153
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,793
Rym: I was touching the skull lady when I turned the page and I remember as a kid.

154
00:09:17,813 --> 00:09:18,716
Scott: I dropped a book.

155
00:09:19,077 --> 00:09:22,334
Rym: wash your hands Yep, don't turn the page shriek.

156
00:09:22,716 --> 00:09:26,839
Rym: wash your hands And then take the page and show to your brother because he's younger than you.

157
00:09:28,837 --> 00:09:32,612
Rym: So This is a big deal and I'm glad it's a I feel like there's.

158
00:09:32,712 --> 00:09:35,180
Scott: only everything old is cut is already been.

159
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:39,516
Scott: Is there anything left that hasn't been like re-released or remade from our generation yet?

160
00:09:39,757 --> 00:09:40,360
Scott: Huh?

161
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,540
Rym: Care Bears didn't get a gritty reboot.

162
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:47,316
Rym: sure Teddy Ruxpin didn't come back.

163
00:09:47,356 --> 00:09:49,505
Scott: I don't think pretty sure Dean ever went away.

164
00:09:49,525 --> 00:09:50,449
Scott: I don't know.

165
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,258
Rym: I don't know much about Teddy Ruxpin anymore.

166
00:09:52,278 --> 00:09:57,118
Rym: I definitely heard his name recently But yeah, so I'm pretty excited about this.

167
00:09:57,158 --> 00:09:57,419
Scott: was it?

168
00:09:57,499 --> 00:09:58,864
Scott: maybe it was the creator pet.

169
00:09:58,944 --> 00:10:01,159
Scott: I know that was Paddington Bear's creator I think passed away.

170
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,413
Scott: Oh I don't know.

171
00:10:03,814 --> 00:10:05,180
Scott: I don't really know the difference between the two.

172
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,726
Rym: They didn't make a new David the gnome.

173
00:10:06,746 --> 00:10:08,051
Scott: I Don't know.

174
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:08,996
Scott: How do you know they didn't?

175
00:10:09,177 --> 00:10:10,001
Rym: I assume they didn't.

176
00:10:10,222 --> 00:10:11,046
Rym: I'm looking at right now.

177
00:10:11,067 --> 00:10:11,649
Rym: So what's your news?

178
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:16,141
Scott: So there's an article on the Guardian that was actually quite fascinating.

179
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:17,465
Scott: It's written by a guy named.

180
00:10:17,485 --> 00:10:18,809
Rym: Oh, they're rebooting it.

181
00:10:20,111 --> 00:10:25,790
Rym: They're rebooting David the gnome Weinstein companies doing what's the year on it - this articles in 2015?

182
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:30,426
Rym: All right Spy kids reboot and David the gnome are rebooting.

183
00:10:30,446 --> 00:10:31,591
Scott: Uh-huh All right.

184
00:10:31,671 --> 00:10:37,310
Scott: Anyway, so this article is written by someone named John Ronson, which is the most porn name I've ever heard.

185
00:10:40,111 --> 00:10:47,330
Scott: But anyway, it's an art because obviously people aren't making too much money with porn anymore because internet right is killed the mark.

186
00:10:47,491 --> 00:10:51,987
Rym: If someone wants generic porn, there's probably literally an infinite variety.

187
00:10:52,248 --> 00:10:58,876
Scott: for all intents and purposes This is article here about you know, the business of making bespoke porn where someone you call them up You tell them what porn you want to make.

188
00:10:59,016 --> 00:11:02,190
Scott: they you know, they give you options of like actors and you know stuff.

189
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:04,750
Rym: So I'm pretty sure that's how two girls in one cup got made.

190
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:13,410
Scott: They try to make the porn as specific to your you know request as possible and send it to you Which is I guess, you know, if you're really into something weird go for it.

191
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,770
Scott: But this article is interesting not for the porn part, right?

192
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,441
Scott: which is actually pretty much they like don't even really talk about porn.

193
00:11:19,461 --> 00:11:21,630
Scott: much in the article is because it's pretty much what you expect like.

194
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:22,734
Scott: Oh people have a fetish.

195
00:11:22,754 --> 00:11:23,376
Scott: they call them up.

196
00:11:23,396 --> 00:11:24,099
Scott: They get porn man.

197
00:11:24,119 --> 00:11:33,601
Scott: All right, whatever right, but the weird stuff is This one guy for example was sending in books of stamp collections and

198
00:11:34,384 --> 00:11:36,009
Rym: we must show you stamps man

199
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:49,639
Scott: and Was like I want you to make a video of like, you know Someone stamping on like stepping on these and like destroying this book of stamp collecting and they're like why it's like, you know There's nothing porny going on in the video.

200
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:57,990
Scott: Well, it's porny for someone sure But this basically it's just like a. you know a foot stepping on this collection of stamps and totally ruining it.

201
00:11:58,238 --> 00:12:00,718
Scott: Oh, yeah Mess up those stamps and it goes into this thing.

202
00:12:00,798 --> 00:12:02,865
Scott: finally find out like what the deal is.

203
00:12:02,885 --> 00:12:09,490
Scott: it was one, dude Basically who apparently in Iceland I think it was there was a. that sounds about right.

204
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,493
Scott: It was a fad.

205
00:12:10,673 --> 00:12:23,790
Scott: for a period of time where everyone is super into stamp collecting and I go a whole street was just like full of stamp collecting shops right and stuff and This person apparently is caught up in that fad much like beanie babies, right?

206
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:26,650
Scott: So there's like basically the guy who has a closet full of beanie babies.

207
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:30,489
Scott: This is the guy who has a big huge stamp collection is just like why why do I have this now?

208
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:35,689
Scott: So he sent all his different books of stamp collections to like different people to have them.

209
00:12:36,111 --> 00:12:43,049
Scott: It was like more than one bespoke porn maker got this request And they already able to find the guy and question him.

210
00:12:43,331 --> 00:12:47,330
Rym: I guess it's hard to tell the line between just a bespoke film and bespoke porn.

211
00:12:47,491 --> 00:12:49,990
Scott: Well, I mean, I think if you're making bespoke porn, right?

212
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:55,003
Scott: You're basically, you know Just what was there between you and anyone else who's making bespoke film.

213
00:12:55,063 --> 00:12:56,990
Scott: is that you're willing to make a film of anything true?

214
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,623
Scott: Someone who's making bespoke films only isn't willing to do certain things, right?

215
00:13:00,945 --> 00:13:04,164
Scott: But if you're bespoke porn maker Well, you can make a video fucking anything.

216
00:13:04,486 --> 00:13:05,030
Scott: It doesn't matter.

217
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:14,310
Scott: So if you don't care about like the artistic merit, and I'm sure they don't do like the worst job in the world But you're not gonna get an Oscar winner from them now, right and as long as it's gonna be short.

218
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,029
Scott: They're not making you something that's like hours long.

219
00:13:17,332 --> 00:13:19,689
Scott: You know, I'm sure there's some kind of limit, right?

220
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:24,450
Scott: But if you want a bespoke film, it might be cheaper to call the bespoke porn people for it.

221
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:27,550
Scott: You know, even though it's non-poor and they'll be like, okay, that's easy.

222
00:13:27,972 --> 00:13:32,410
Scott: I think it's like we're willing to like do all this other crazy shit like, you know, whatever.

223
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:38,028
Scott: So we'll definitely do your step on a book video or you know, whatever it is.

224
00:13:38,048 --> 00:13:38,610
Scott: We don't care.

225
00:13:42,811 --> 00:13:54,429
Rym: There's one guy who want us to buy a van and have my wife and a couple of other girls drive around in it for A week and smoke cigarettes in the van and pee in the van at the end of the week drive the van into the desert And blow it up and he sent them pictures of the van.

226
00:13:55,671 --> 00:14:02,150
Rym: And I. the best part is his quest like their question to this person was and I quote why that particular van?

227
00:14:02,772 --> 00:14:03,736
Scott: Hmm, he's got it.

228
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:06,730
Scott: Maybe that's a van from like that the guy had in college or something.

229
00:14:06,951 --> 00:14:08,095
Scott: You know, it's just.

230
00:14:08,235 --> 00:14:09,480
Scott: it's got to be the right van.

231
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,182
Scott: Yeah.

232
00:14:10,644 --> 00:14:12,290
Rym: Let me drive my van into your heart.

233
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:21,010
Rym: So you didn't watch enough Steven Universe, you know, that's actually in like episode like two or three like that's at the beginning.

234
00:14:21,131 --> 00:14:22,863
Scott: Well, I mean, I only saw the dead.

235
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:23,930
Scott: I know the dad has a van.

236
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,260
Scott: I only saw the episode like one.

237
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,530
Rym: well now Harlock is in the show.

238
00:14:27,471 --> 00:14:34,790
Rym: Actual captain Harlow a character became Harlock in a spaceship with the crew dressed like Harlock having Harlock space battles.

239
00:14:35,613 --> 00:14:37,000
Scott: You haven't even watched captain Harlock.

240
00:14:37,341 --> 00:14:39,190
Rym: I've seen some of it, but I didn't watch the opener.

241
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:40,274
Scott: You haven't watched the show.

242
00:14:40,294 --> 00:14:42,884
Scott: I think I even know what the plot is of the show captain.

243
00:14:42,904 --> 00:14:45,454
Rym: Harlock is a Humble space pirate.

244
00:14:45,514 --> 00:14:47,301
Rym: is he fight fights under his own flag?

245
00:14:47,321 --> 00:14:47,944
Rym: Who's he fighting?

246
00:14:47,984 --> 00:14:49,590
Scott: Like if I know it's you don't know shit.

247
00:14:49,711 --> 00:14:50,476
Scott: No, what do you know?

248
00:14:50,496 --> 00:14:56,069
Rym: He's a space pirate fighting under his own flag For Nostra Liber dad.

249
00:14:57,315 --> 00:15:12,269
Rym: so in some other news This I guess it could be technology news but it's just sort of like a PSA because I've had to explain this to a lot of people professionally over the years, but Fonts are just as copyrighted as anything else.

250
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:13,234
Scott: They're super.

251
00:15:13,435 --> 00:15:16,169
Scott: more so even and the people who make because make.

252
00:15:16,189 --> 00:15:22,479
Scott: you know The people who make fonts a good fonts not easy to make if it's a quality font It takes a lot of effort to design and make.

253
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:33,157
Scott: and the people who make them, you know Since they put in so much effort they I mean regardless of what you think about intellectual property law as a concept Which we've talked about a trillion times.

254
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:37,530
Scott: The law is at least in countries where it's enforced like this one.

255
00:15:38,792 --> 00:15:41,270
Scott: You can't just go using a font for whatever you want, right?

256
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:44,270
Scott: It's like you can make a word document and print it out at work and it's not a big deal.

257
00:15:44,672 --> 00:15:52,778
Scott: but if you like make a website and you're like a Commercial business of the website and you use some font on your website You have to have the rights to do that.

258
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,550
Scott: you print out newspapers and sell them on the street.

259
00:15:56,314 --> 00:15:59,650
Scott: If you're using a font in that newspaper, you better have the rights to use that font.

260
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,156
Scott: Otherwise it gets complicated.

261
00:16:01,176 --> 00:16:03,284
Scott: if someone sees they're gonna come after you.

262
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:05,994
Scott: even if you make you know buy a font.

263
00:16:06,155 --> 00:16:15,346
Rym: usually the licenses will have clauses that limit like can only be used for print runs of less than 10,000 per year or can only be used in these circumstances but not in video.

264
00:16:15,366 --> 00:16:27,567
Scott: that's on broadcast TV like it actually has a lot of consequences for the performance of websites because for example, if you use something like Adobe typekit, which oh, yeah, it gives you access to a zillion fonts legally.

265
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:28,350
Scott: you got to pay for it.

266
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:30,650
Rym: It comes with they don't send you the file.

267
00:16:30,911 --> 00:16:34,690
Scott: No, you have to basically, you know put this complicate to do it legally, right?

268
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:48,810
Scott: You could obviously to pirate the font but to do it legally the way they want you to is you include this code on Your website that like loads up the font and delivers it to the customer If assuming they don't have it on their computer and if it somehow doesn't work it uses a font from the person's computer.

269
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:56,550
Scott: But anyway, the point is all of this like rights checking stuff really slows down the website when you're like look just a load of font.

270
00:16:56,851 --> 00:16:59,229
Rym: Oh, yeah, I changed the fuck as I get when I set up our.

271
00:16:59,289 --> 00:17:03,970
Scott: my Good, we could have just had a world where people go like font equals.

272
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:09,150
Scott: You know HTTP colon blah blah blah blah dot TTF and they just download fonts.

273
00:17:09,634 --> 00:17:15,002
Scott: but we can't have that world because People are so and you know people who make fonts or so.

274
00:17:15,303 --> 00:17:24,964
Rym: and there's also the thing recently where the use of a font in a document proved that said document was forged because that font didn't exist in the year the document purported to be from.

275
00:17:26,132 --> 00:17:26,634
Scott: It's like a mug.

276
00:17:26,654 --> 00:17:28,321
Rym: There's like a big thing with the brema.

277
00:17:28,342 --> 00:17:31,517
Scott: I said I just use the text file, bro Yeah, use the text file.

278
00:17:31,537 --> 00:17:32,321
Scott: You wouldn't have a font.

279
00:17:32,562 --> 00:17:33,024
Scott: Yeah,

280
00:17:33,466 --> 00:17:53,370
Rym: but well But anyway, so this is a sort of article that talks about this and how there's some big money and big damages here And all you really need to know is that just because the font is in like an application that you have Doesn't mean you actually have the legal right to use that font pretty much anywhere.

281
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:58,290
Scott: Yeah You might like use the font like making a logo in Photoshop and it's like you have a zillion fonts in Photoshop.

282
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,410
Scott: You get one from typekit into Photoshop.

283
00:18:00,516 --> 00:18:10,820
Scott: Yeah But you can do just by clicking and you have it now And then you make a logo with it and then you use that logo and now your logos Your famous trademark and then the person who made the

284
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:11,984
Rym: font sees

285
00:18:12,044 --> 00:18:13,630
Scott: that in your logo

286
00:18:15,412 --> 00:18:18,003
Rym: In your trademark like go lawyer

287
00:18:18,143 --> 00:18:18,264
Scott: up.

288
00:18:18,384 --> 00:18:19,730
Scott: now, they're coming for your monies.

289
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:23,289
Scott: I mean if you didn't pay for it properly in the beginning they coming for you.

290
00:18:23,515 --> 00:18:32,279
Rym: Yeah Fonts are complicated and also you might wonder well I don't people just use those free fonts because there's a lot of fonts that are basically public domain suck mostly like

291
00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:39,270
Scott: the high quality unique or You know perfect fonts that don't have like, you know these minor typographic issues.

292
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:40,174
Scott: You don't even think about it.

293
00:18:40,274 --> 00:18:46,800
Rym: ones that are really really polished are like made by Apple or but the best fonts are the ones that you literally like.

294
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:56,977
Rym: they're so good that you look at a website or like you look at a thing and it just looks good and you can't really even articulate why and then you look at something else and the font is So similar, but it looks wrong and you're like.

295
00:18:57,339 --> 00:18:59,909
Scott: you can't tell why but the typographic people can tell why.

296
00:18:59,989 --> 00:19:05,510
Rym: yeah I can't tell why but I can tell look what looks good or bad because that expertise is what helps them make good fonts.

297
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:07,974
Rym: Yep, cuz I've actually I Scarily enough.

298
00:19:08,034 --> 00:19:13,815
Rym: I've been doing a lot of like legit graphic design lately, which is weird But that's what I like.

299
00:19:14,156 --> 00:19:18,089
Rym: I know my way the hell around in design and illustrator now more so than I want to.

300
00:19:19,433 --> 00:19:27,102
Rym: so in some other news a bunch of articles were Running around about this lately, but it seems like this is legit.

301
00:19:27,564 --> 00:19:32,240
Rym: Okay, a lot of people are younger than us Literally don't know that broadcast TV exists.

302
00:19:33,063 --> 00:19:34,469
Scott: Why would they know they never watched it?

303
00:19:35,231 --> 00:19:35,652
Rym: they never.

304
00:19:36,113 --> 00:19:51,354
Rym: most people seem to think when when we switch from analog to digital most young people who basically noticed television who were like 10 15 years younger than us when they came of age, they just had cable probably and internet and Broadcast TV was gone.

305
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:59,330
Rym: and very few people except people who actually relied on broadcast television mostly in rural areas Bothered upgrading to modern digital antennas.

306
00:19:59,511 --> 00:20:07,519
Scott: I think even people who do live in rural areas right in the years between like, you know 2017 they all got satellite dishes.

307
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,810
Scott: satellite just used to be a giant enormous thing.

308
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:12,209
Scott: We had a satellite only just just for HBO.

309
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:17,830
Scott: That's all we got the only thing affluent people could get and only if they were willing to put some giant ass dish out.

310
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:18,775
Scott: But you know what?

311
00:20:18,876 --> 00:20:29,017
Scott: once there was DirecTV and Dish Network with the small dishes Everyone around the world who wasn't like in a very populous area that had You know cable all got dishes.

312
00:20:29,358 --> 00:20:38,285
Scott: and if you go to places that are even populous highly dense The populated areas if they don't have the infrastructure to actually wire everyone up with cable.

313
00:20:38,486 --> 00:20:39,910
Scott: Just everyone's got dishes.

314
00:20:40,011 --> 00:20:41,161
Scott: You go you go like India.

315
00:20:41,201 --> 00:20:42,150
Scott: It's like dishes everywhere.

316
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:48,226
Rym: It's actually crazy like when I was young even like the reason satellite receivers those big ones appeared.

317
00:20:48,607 --> 00:20:49,590
Rym: was that in the old days?

318
00:20:50,051 --> 00:20:58,476
Rym: Television shows even like proprietary like special stuff or premium stuff was broadcast to the local networks Unencrypted via satellite.

319
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:03,878
Rym: So if you just got a dish and pointed it into the sky You basically got the equivalent of free cable.

320
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:07,129
Rym: So people were buying dishes and like stealing TV.

321
00:21:07,772 --> 00:21:10,967
Scott: Also, there weren't as many satellites up in the sky helping out with this.

322
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:18,690
Scott: Yeah, right It's been since then a lot of rockets put a lot more satellites up there to help Have satellite TV.

323
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:26,702
Rym: They only started encrypting this stuff because nerds were basically watching TV for free or seeing shows before they were even released.

324
00:21:26,782 --> 00:21:30,193
Rym: like all sorts of nonsense was going on And cable.

325
00:21:30,233 --> 00:21:36,070
Rym: like I remember when cable came to my neighborhood as a kid cable used to be a ridiculous luxury.

326
00:21:36,311 --> 00:21:40,330
Scott: The point is TV with no commercial point is people younger than us, right?

327
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:42,599
Scott: So we're at least a few years younger than us did not?

328
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,463
Scott: we're not conscious.

329
00:21:43,564 --> 00:21:57,036
Scott: at a time when Broadcast television was used right pretty much at all by anyone everyone had a cable or a dish or was the kind of person didn't have TV and Broadcast TV is still out there.

330
00:21:57,398 --> 00:21:58,461
Scott: You know, it's still a thing.

331
00:21:58,481 --> 00:21:58,882
Scott: It's.

332
00:21:59,023 --> 00:21:59,946
Scott: it's I think in Japan.

333
00:22:00,006 --> 00:22:01,230
Scott: It's still like a huge thing, too.

334
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:10,236
Rym: Yeah, it's in other countries even but the US had such a cable culture and US TV culture is pretty like like I've Doing that anime openers panel.

335
00:22:10,256 --> 00:22:13,990
Rym: Like I learned a decent amount about like how Italian TV works as mother countries.

336
00:22:14,592 --> 00:22:19,670
Rym: US TV culture is like really weird and not many other places are like the way US like stuff worked out.

337
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:23,079
Rym: No for a lot of reasons, but another come out of this story.

338
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:30,689
Rym: Is that half the articles about this are clearly like planted by marketing companies to push an agenda?

339
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:36,569
Rym: Because I like some of these quotes are just obviously so fake like it's kind of awesome.

340
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:43,990
Rym: It doesn't Helping them out by spreading their message because some of the articles are legit and just talking about the technology.

341
00:22:44,511 --> 00:22:51,690
Rym: But basically what seems to be happening now is people are buying antennas who previously didn't know broadcast TV existed.

342
00:22:52,131 --> 00:22:54,841
Scott: Is this really happening or someone just writing articles saying it's happening?

343
00:22:54,901 --> 00:22:55,944
Rym: No, it's definitely happening.

344
00:22:55,964 --> 00:23:00,922
Rym: to antenna sales have actually risen Mm-hmm for the first time like since ever.

345
00:23:00,942 --> 00:23:03,190
Scott: it's interesting because you see things coming out like this.

346
00:23:03,331 --> 00:23:05,088
Scott: I almost considered it the YouTube TV.

347
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:11,364
Scott: Yeah You pay a very small amount of money to YouTube every month and then they will just YouTube.

348
00:23:11,404 --> 00:23:12,948
Scott: they will suddenly on YouTube.

349
00:23:13,069 --> 00:23:18,807
Scott: is your local TV stations live and you could even like, you know roll back and DVRs to some extent.

350
00:23:18,968 --> 00:23:20,353
Scott: I don't know exactly People are doing it.

351
00:23:20,434 --> 00:23:22,363
Rym: It seems mostly to watch sports.

352
00:23:22,704 --> 00:23:27,290
Rym: Yeah, that's what I was gonna do with it Which doesn't help me because I want to watch Rangers which would probably be blacked out anyway.

353
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,843
Scott: No, that wouldn't be on broadcast.

354
00:23:28,863 --> 00:23:37,619
Scott: That would be on You know, yeah MSG Network and not but you can watch football Yeah, and then you know Fox CBS whatever.

355
00:23:37,699 --> 00:23:48,658
Rym: but so yeah, basically if you didn't know There is TV that's digital that's just in the air and if you buy like a $10 antenna It'll just be on your TV.

356
00:23:48,899 --> 00:23:52,538
Scott: assuming that you're close enough to it, you know broadcast thing You'll no matter where you are.

357
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:53,789
Scott: You're gonna get at least one station.

358
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:56,439
Scott: Yep, you know where I lived in Connecticut growing up.

359
00:23:56,459 --> 00:24:08,790
Scott: we had because we were so close to New York, but also, Connecticut To CBS to Fox to NVC to every two of all the major station I had one better plus local stations that were you know syndicated and stuff.

360
00:24:09,292 --> 00:24:11,181
Rym: I was in the in Michigan in the Midwest.

361
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,050
Rym: I got US channels Detroit.

362
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:20,050
Rym: I also got the suburban channels because the Detroit channels were like way powerful and I got all the Canadian channels from Windsor.

363
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:22,605
Scott: Oh, wouldn't Canadian channels be using like different technology though?

364
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:29,677
Scott: No, okay There's the same because I'm pretty sure if you take your channel, I remember Channel 9 TV to like, you know somewhere else.

365
00:24:29,717 --> 00:24:33,870
Scott: It might not work not just NTSC pal, but you know other types of differences.

366
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:38,410
Rym: Well, let's not get into UHF and VHF and all that nonsense, right?

367
00:24:39,033 --> 00:24:41,043
Scott: Which I know the UHF has been sold off.

368
00:24:41,224 --> 00:24:42,450
Rym: It's all that stuff's gone.

369
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:46,509
Rym: We're now using it for I actually know a lot about it because this is how old we are.

370
00:24:46,972 --> 00:24:50,230
Rym: We learned about this at RIT and my wife one of my first IT classes.

371
00:24:50,812 --> 00:25:04,676
Rym: it was like literally like we learned like how the electrical signals work in like Ethernet and like exact like the details of like fiber encoding and broadcasting coding and radio encoding and all that nonsense and Literally everything I learned in that class.

372
00:25:05,058 --> 00:25:08,390
Rym: literally everything is obsolete and basically not used anywhere anymore.

373
00:25:08,491 --> 00:25:11,030
Rym: Mm-hmm, so I can tell you all about differential Manchester.

374
00:25:11,231 --> 00:25:12,596
Rym: But that's not what modern Ethernet uses.

375
00:25:12,657 --> 00:25:16,252
Scott: It's someone's job to like make sure this is broadcasting still works And it's like.

376
00:25:16,272 --> 00:25:19,450
Scott: would they even know if it's soft working is even as if no one's watching it.

377
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:21,930
Scott: Yeah, how much energy are we using on broadcasting?

378
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:27,698
Scott: You know TV and radio over the actually no way less No one is listening to.

379
00:25:27,798 --> 00:25:30,590
Scott: the old method radio towers is still really powerful.

380
00:25:31,011 --> 00:25:35,307
Scott: Yeah, the multi kilowatt radio towers and what they don't even know.

381
00:25:35,348 --> 00:25:39,002
Scott: if anyone's listening How do they know based on how many people call in when there's a contest?

382
00:25:39,303 --> 00:25:47,322
Rym: but the other crazy thing was back then because Like the world was old and archaic they would always everything we saw.

383
00:25:47,382 --> 00:25:51,635
Rym: they'd be like tonight at 7 o'clock 6 Central The Simpsons.

384
00:25:52,056 --> 00:25:57,859
Rym: they had to take into account the fact that they covered multiple time zones with a broadcast In a way that does not matter.

385
00:25:57,939 --> 00:26:03,129
Rym: in the modern era stuff usually just comes on at midnight For the next day on Netflix or whatever.

386
00:26:09,057 --> 00:26:09,805
Rym: but anyway things.

387
00:26:11,832 --> 00:26:14,890
Rym: So first I learned that you know what Harlock fights wine.

388
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:17,470
Rym: He is the destroyer of wine.

389
00:26:18,534 --> 00:26:20,890
Rym: He drinks a lot of wine sure yeah, but anyway.

390
00:26:21,231 --> 00:26:24,581
Rym: So I found this video kind of randomly and it was really fascinating.

391
00:26:24,661 --> 00:26:34,277
Rym: you know old medieval looking buildings or like old germanic buildings Like the second floor is actually like wider than the first floor like you see that a lot in old towns sometimes I know you're like.

392
00:26:34,944 --> 00:26:35,509
Scott: I've seen it.

393
00:26:36,071 --> 00:26:42,050
Rym: And if they go higher like every higher floor is always bigger than the floor under it to the point that it's kind of ridiculous.

394
00:26:42,553 --> 00:26:43,377
Scott: I've never seen one.

395
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:45,729
Scott: I'm sure that exists, but I can't.

396
00:26:45,869 --> 00:26:49,686
Scott: I mean I've definitely know the thing where the where the it was like little sort of like.

397
00:26:49,706 --> 00:26:52,293
Scott: you know triangular Struts and this.

398
00:26:52,635 --> 00:26:57,215
Scott: like all this the second floor sticks out sort of like there's a balcony But the balcony is on the inside.

399
00:26:57,577 --> 00:27:01,190
Scott: so but I never seen anything like continue going up like upside-down pyramid.

400
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:03,420
Rym: So why do you think that is like?

401
00:27:03,501 --> 00:27:04,847
Rym: why do they build buildings that way?

402
00:27:05,068 --> 00:27:05,550
Rym: What do you think?

403
00:27:05,651 --> 00:27:06,902
Scott: They were bad at building buildings.

404
00:27:07,589 --> 00:27:10,675
Rym: uh No, actually if they were bad at building buildings They wouldn't have done it that way.

405
00:27:10,715 --> 00:27:13,448
Rym: so try again cuz I had an idea that I was super wrong about.

406
00:27:13,468 --> 00:27:13,770
Rym: I don't know.

407
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:14,793
Scott: What do I know about architecture?

408
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:15,656
Scott: nothing nothing.

409
00:27:16,058 --> 00:27:18,807
Rym: it was because castles looked that way and it was the defensive thing.

410
00:27:19,148 --> 00:27:22,884
Rym: and this video is Basically like no none of you know shit about our defending a little wooden house.

411
00:27:22,924 --> 00:27:24,530
Scott: someone who said it on fire there It's done.

412
00:27:24,771 --> 00:27:34,330
Scott: I always assume a defense that castles did it for a defensive reason and other buildings did it to look like castles Uh-huh, but I never thought about it to even come up with the reason.

413
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:35,473
Rym: I thought about it a little.

414
00:27:35,974 --> 00:27:41,730
Rym: so this video goes into extreme detail on why medieval buildings are built that way.

415
00:27:42,292 --> 00:27:43,356
Rym: And it's not for the reason.

416
00:27:43,416 --> 00:27:50,990
Scott: I thought and it actually makes a lot of sense, and it's really interesting It makes a nice little tiny tiny place to hide if the rain is falling.

417
00:27:51,714 --> 00:27:53,869
Scott: Oh, yeah, actually you haven't invented the awning yet.

418
00:27:54,392 --> 00:27:58,730
Rym: It also means people in upper floors emptying the chamber pots will get them further away from the base of your house.

419
00:27:58,972 --> 00:27:59,578
Scott: Is that the reason?

420
00:28:00,003 --> 00:28:00,327
Rym: uh no?

421
00:28:01,252 --> 00:28:02,075
Rym: There's two reasons.

422
00:28:02,857 --> 00:28:04,182
Rym: one reason is structural.

423
00:28:04,322 --> 00:28:06,790
Rym: the structure is actually better that way which seems crazy.

424
00:28:06,871 --> 00:28:08,529
Rym: But then there's a bunch of diagrams explaining why?

425
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:12,903
Rym: Like that it's actually better to build a wooden house that way.

426
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:14,550
Scott: why don't we build houses that way anymore?

427
00:28:15,031 --> 00:28:21,490
Rym: Because we use very different building techniques like the kinds of houses We build are not the kinds of houses They used to build anyway.

428
00:28:21,891 --> 00:28:22,293
Rym: this is just.

429
00:28:22,393 --> 00:28:22,975
Rym: this was like.

430
00:28:23,437 --> 00:28:32,070
Rym: I was surprised at how interesting a video about this very specific and Minor detail of medieval architecture was but it ended up being really interesting.

431
00:28:32,913 --> 00:28:33,819
Rym: It's like 20 minutes long.

432
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:35,410
Rym: There's a lot to say which is terrifying.

433
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:41,640
Scott: Alright, so we you know we're gonna talk about this in a minute We spent the weekend and like upstate New York biking or whatever.

434
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:44,630
Scott: so I was thinking about the upstate New York boonies areas.

435
00:28:45,152 --> 00:28:50,478
Scott: But and in high school you would go with the youth group We would go to these conventions and the.

436
00:28:50,678 --> 00:28:58,027
Scott: our conventions were held in the Paramount Hotel in Parksville New York, so I was like alright you pointed that out.

437
00:28:58,067 --> 00:29:08,289
Scott: like any time We've been even within like 50 miles and you'll be like hey, right well by the time I was in college I think shortly after the last time I was there in the late 90s it burned down and that was the end of it.

438
00:29:08,611 --> 00:29:13,328
Scott: But we drove past it a few times in the RIT days because it was on the way to wherever we were going.

439
00:29:13,349 --> 00:29:14,595
Rym: every time You'd be like a ram.

440
00:29:14,615 --> 00:29:17,030
Scott: You know we took the other road instead of 90.

441
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,556
Rym: I mean, you know what that is.

442
00:29:18,576 --> 00:29:19,179
Scott: that's right.

443
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:21,950
Scott: It's like it's basically a lot like the hotel from the shining.

444
00:29:22,512 --> 00:29:29,152
Scott: Yeah big and it's you know back in the day you got to remember way back like well You know my parents age Right.

445
00:29:29,372 --> 00:29:46,330
Scott: the Jews from New York City in the summer would go up to the Catskills and spend their time basically their whole summer almost in these either bungalow colonies or Big giant luxury hotel places, and this is where you had like all the great comedians

446
00:29:47,696 --> 00:29:48,566
Rym: You ever hear of the borscht

447
00:29:48,587 --> 00:29:49,752
Scott: belt Borscht

448
00:29:49,772 --> 00:29:50,334
Rym: belt comedy?

449
00:29:50,354 --> 00:29:53,184
Scott: right all that stuff was in these kind of places right?

450
00:29:53,204 --> 00:29:59,590
Scott: you know dirty dancing that movie Was in one of the hotels up there one of the fancier ones that had ice skating and shit, right?

451
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:10,487
Scott: but you know the Paramount was one that still existed in the late 90s before it burnt down and I Was like I was thinking about it again because we were you know we were upstate, New York even though We were way east of where this is.

452
00:30:10,527 --> 00:30:10,709
Scott: yeah.

453
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,777
Scott: So I googled it, and I'm like.

454
00:30:12,918 --> 00:30:14,224
Scott: I wonder if there's any new info.

455
00:30:14,265 --> 00:30:16,434
Scott: so I went to Google Maps And I saw up.

456
00:30:16,474 --> 00:30:20,930
Scott: no it's still the same satellite image and the street view car still hasn't been on that road.

457
00:30:21,293 --> 00:30:31,648
Scott: I still can't see anything better But I can still see what's there which basically looks like a crazy Mashed up nonsense building with a rundown pool outside of it.

458
00:30:32,793 --> 00:30:43,950
Scott: but I found this interview, but I guess the guy who owned it for maybe a few years ago like 2010s and This interview is really fascinating from somebody who spent time in that hotel.

459
00:30:44,071 --> 00:30:45,729
Scott: I went to it like four or five times.

460
00:30:46,252 --> 00:30:47,538
Scott: It was very interesting to read with.

461
00:30:47,558 --> 00:30:56,729
Scott: this guy had to say about it, and it makes me think Maybe that fire was not no accident Insurance fraud in his way out of that hotel.

462
00:30:58,732 --> 00:31:01,850
Rym: But the hotel was like a hundred years old at that point right like it was old.

463
00:31:02,435 --> 00:31:09,749
Scott: It was like the most crazy Like we got lost every time we're in that hotel And we would like we try to walk like figure out our way around it.

464
00:31:10,112 --> 00:31:12,870
Scott: It was like a Resident Evil situation only we couldn't remember.

465
00:31:14,031 --> 00:31:19,606
Scott: We ended up in places that were like under construction Just like open to the air and really weird and then we entered like it.

466
00:31:19,787 --> 00:31:23,243
Scott: you'd go down a hallway And you'd be like in a different building like it was.

467
00:31:23,283 --> 00:31:25,353
Scott: so many additions added to it And they're all different.

468
00:31:25,735 --> 00:31:32,361
Scott: and it's like all the doors were red and the carpet was different in this area And there's these ghost girls who are trying to murder you.

469
00:31:32,381 --> 00:31:33,605
Scott: the banquet halls.

470
00:31:33,645 --> 00:31:34,408
Scott: We ate luncheon.

471
00:31:34,428 --> 00:31:41,774
Scott: We're just like enormous like the biggest friggin like hall you've ever seen like so like tables and chairs like it's Super-far.

472
00:31:41,794 --> 00:31:44,207
Scott: you could have a wedding for like a thousand people in there.

473
00:31:44,248 --> 00:31:47,199
Scott: probably It was insane how big this place was.

474
00:31:47,239 --> 00:32:00,330
Scott: and then like you know we would go and hang this that we did most of our Stuff in this like downstairs like kind of area that had like a stage and a huge dance floor and a bar And an empty cigarette vending machine because that's how old the place was.

475
00:32:02,071 --> 00:32:06,485
Scott: They still had those but most of the people staying there when we were there that weren't you know?

476
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:15,737
Scott: for an event like ours We're like hunters whereas back in the day like that was a happening place people were going there just to go there Which is crazy to me.

477
00:32:15,777 --> 00:32:17,264
Rym: like think about how different the world is like.

478
00:32:17,586 --> 00:32:18,430
Rym: would you go to a hotel?

479
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:22,426
Rym: Just like somewhere not that far from your house and just stay?

480
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:28,238
Scott: people do it today but they do it either on hotels that float or Hotels in tropical places.

481
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:31,314
Scott: Yeah, I'll do it in hotels that are like Nearby.

482
00:32:31,475 --> 00:32:34,350
Rym: usually they do it like like the Gaylord is kind of like a modern.

483
00:32:35,574 --> 00:32:37,319
Scott: People are going to do this kind of thing.

484
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:40,088
Scott: they'll go to a hotel, but they're not going to the hotel.

485
00:32:40,128 --> 00:32:46,190
Scott: to go to the Hotel it's that there's attractions in the area right and the hotel is just a place they sleep.

486
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:47,435
Scott: We're now back in the day.

487
00:32:47,836 --> 00:32:49,964
Scott: there weren't attractions right?

488
00:32:50,085 --> 00:32:56,510
Scott: it was the hotel built Attractions so that you would come to it and that it would provide you everything in the one place.

489
00:32:56,570 --> 00:33:00,964
Scott: It would be like you know people do have resorts in the tropics that hotel that.

490
00:33:01,144 --> 00:33:01,305
Scott: what's.

491
00:33:01,405 --> 00:33:06,350
Scott: also attractions in the same place Casino food what you know pool beach whatever.

492
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:08,636
Scott: This is the same idea only in the woods.

493
00:33:09,078 --> 00:33:12,788
Scott: only the idea of it not being tropical has sort of become not popular.

494
00:33:12,868 --> 00:33:22,169
Rym: Yeah So uh in the meta moment the book club book was Frank Herbert's dune And we read it a while ago, and we're done in the episodes up, and you can just listen to it.

495
00:33:22,855 --> 00:33:23,643
Rym: So yeah, we're done.

496
00:33:23,683 --> 00:33:24,249
Rym: We read dune.

497
00:33:25,015 --> 00:33:25,700
Rym: It was what it was.

498
00:33:25,761 --> 00:33:27,974
Rym: you can if you want to know our thoughts on it You can listen to this episode.

499
00:33:27,994 --> 00:33:32,410
Scott: so the new book club book is the fifth season not winter spring summer or fall.

500
00:33:32,592 --> 00:33:34,649
Scott: It's not another kind of season.

501
00:33:35,751 --> 00:33:41,090
Scott: By NK jemisin, this is like the hottest you know fantasy sci-fi author right now.

502
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:44,722
Scott: So and this is like I guess the first book you're supposed to read from this author's.

503
00:33:44,762 --> 00:33:45,364
Scott: that's what we're gonna.

504
00:33:45,384 --> 00:33:49,640
Scott: Do yep other the metamoment stuff.

505
00:33:51,211 --> 00:33:54,426
Scott: I've actually gotten a lot of people applying to the forums recently.

506
00:33:54,807 --> 00:33:55,370
Rym: Oh welcome.

507
00:33:56,032 --> 00:34:02,595
Scott: No, I accepted none of them because there's a when you fill out the form to join the forum There's like a fill a field.

508
00:34:02,615 --> 00:34:14,462
Scott: that's like reason for joining and a lot of people write something like Discussion or one person wrote I want to make friends who play csgo and someone else wrote something else right.

509
00:34:15,047 --> 00:34:23,438
Scott: and It's like some of these things are clearly not something a human would write or something a human ignored the field and just typed in Whatever or a human who would write.

510
00:34:23,458 --> 00:34:25,250
Rym: that is not someone I want to talk to necessarily.

527
00:35:28,291 --> 00:35:31,387

528
00:35:31,427 --> 00:35:33,939
Rym: our Scott backer Just has been a thing with us for a long time.

529
00:35:34,502 --> 00:35:37,778
Scott: since as long as GeekNights has existed This has been our fantasy series.

530
00:35:37,798 --> 00:35:43,085
Scott: Yeah, that is not the greatest fantasy series But we are super obsessed with it because it is the most GeekNights.

531
00:35:43,226 --> 00:35:46,375
Rym: Yeah, it's uh It fits us real well.

532
00:35:46,395 --> 00:35:48,824
Rym: a lot of its aspects, and there's reasons.

533
00:35:48,844 --> 00:35:50,450
Scott: not all of its aspects, but enough.

534
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:54,260
Rym: But we just finished the last book.

535
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,346
Rym: so or the latest book.

536
00:35:55,969 --> 00:35:57,233
Scott: so Appendices.

537
00:35:57,534 --> 00:35:57,836
Rym: I'm gonna.

538
00:35:57,856 --> 00:35:59,504
Rym: I'm reading the appendices like all night tonight.

539
00:35:59,886 --> 00:36:00,489
Scott: I got to work on.

540
00:36:01,436 --> 00:36:03,512
Rym: I'm reading the whole thing cuz the appendices I love.

541
00:36:03,553 --> 00:36:09,469
Scott: the one thing I love about these books is that well one appendices glossary one is apps But the other two have actual stuff.

542
00:36:09,891 --> 00:36:25,030
Rym: But the fact that every book has like a glossary at the end and the same thing will have a definition In every book, but in every book that definition is expanded More and more based on things you've learned along the way.

543
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:29,822
Scott: What's great is if you go online and look at other fans of these books they notice particular things.

544
00:36:29,862 --> 00:36:40,050
Scott: they notice that an unusual number of Moderately important figures in the world all died in this same year according to the glossary.

545
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:43,199
Rym: I noticed that in particular that can't be a coincidence.

546
00:36:43,219 --> 00:36:43,821
Scott: what happened?

547
00:36:43,861 --> 00:36:45,145
Scott: it happened in a dirt.

548
00:36:45,165 --> 00:36:55,183
Scott: that year happens to fall between It's the year of the tusk in between two of the books when you know An area of time that we don't get a lot of information about.

549
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,810
Scott: yep, so what's up with that?

550
00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:03,010
Rym: Well, I noticed too that there's a lot of people who died in the year that the book we just read takes place.

551
00:37:03,456 --> 00:37:11,390
Scott: There's also Quite a few like errors that have been pointed out by people online like someone's eye color changes from book to book.

552
00:37:11,491 --> 00:37:12,265
Scott: Yeah like that.

553
00:37:12,285 --> 00:37:20,610
Rym: so You know Scratchy stuck sort of itchy struck the same rib twice and yet two distinct notes were sounded.

554
00:37:21,934 --> 00:37:22,730
Rym: That kind of complaint.

555
00:37:23,172 --> 00:37:23,594
Rym: There's an hours.

556
00:37:23,614 --> 00:37:28,093
Rym: go back our AMA where he was answering a lot of questions too and for a couple of me was like most of All my questions.

557
00:37:28,114 --> 00:37:31,607
Scott: He was like he wrote RAFO which means read and find out.

558
00:37:31,788 --> 00:37:34,570
Scott: yep I'm just like we're at a heron spear.

559
00:37:34,691 --> 00:37:38,428
Scott: I thought I was gonna have my heron spear in this book, and I didn't get it, and he's like read and find out.

560
00:37:38,608 --> 00:37:41,076
Rym: yeah But that's good.

561
00:37:41,096 --> 00:37:42,059
Rym: There's the three answers.

562
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:42,982
Rym: It gives her basically.

563
00:37:43,363 --> 00:37:49,741
Rym: No you didn't read the book closely enough or No, that's a really clever thing you notice, but that's not intentional.

564
00:37:50,162 --> 00:37:51,366
Rym: or read your book dude.

565
00:37:51,847 --> 00:37:52,810
Rym: There's more book coming.

566
00:37:53,931 --> 00:37:55,357
Scott: Don't die before you write this book.

567
00:37:55,478 --> 00:37:56,020
Scott: How old are you?

568
00:37:56,301 --> 00:37:56,522
Rym: Yeah?

569
00:37:57,246 --> 00:37:58,210
Rym: I feel like he's doing okay?

570
00:37:58,730 --> 00:37:59,154
Scott: We'll make it.

571
00:37:59,981 --> 00:38:07,789
Rym: so uh yeah We did this bike ride, and it was pretty great, and I feel like well We have we'll get all our bike talk out in this show.

574
00:38:10,941 --> 00:38:11,081
Scott: right.

575
00:38:11,101 --> 00:38:13,570
Scott: so what happened was is you know my biking friend?

576
00:38:13,671 --> 00:38:29,970
Scott: Told me last year hey I went in this bike ride Where you take the train upstate to somewhere in the boonies and then you camp on a field and then you wake up in Bike all day and you come back and there's awesome food And they support the ride and there's awesome rest stops and awesome scenery.

577
00:38:30,392 --> 00:38:33,804
Scott: And then you come home on the train, and I'm like that sounds crazy fun.

578
00:38:33,824 --> 00:38:35,290
Scott: I would like to do this yep.

579
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:37,918
Scott: So this year I was like oh, it's spring again.

580
00:38:38,179 --> 00:38:41,430

581
00:38:41,851 --> 00:38:43,817
Scott: I will ask oh hey, Katie.

582

00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:47,910
Scott: Oh, it's the Harlem Valley rail ride, okay?

584
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:49,157
Scott: So I go in and register for it.

585
00:38:49,258 --> 00:39:00,596
Scott: once we decide I'm gonna do it right I'm not gonna do it alone, but once I figured people seem like it's gonna happen I just registered yep, and then I got a phone call that was like hey You're the first person to register it.

586
00:39:00,616 --> 00:39:03,186
Rym: I'm like really I registered the Thursday before.

587
00:39:03,206 --> 00:39:08,490
Scott: yeah apparently I'm real dumb for registering early even though it turned out great.

588
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:15,996
Scott: But most people register for these bike ride things that like close to the last second as possible because they want to check the weather Right which makes sense.

589
00:39:16,017 --> 00:39:16,257
Rym: there was.

590
00:39:16,358 --> 00:39:25,090
Scott: I like biking in the rain like I don't mind if it's regular Miles in driving rain, and I don't have to be anywhere, and it's not so slippery.

591
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:28,910
Scott: I'm gonna fall over and die or something right, but you know obviously I prefer it not to be raining.

592
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:40,690
Scott: Yeah, but apparently she you're showing me this other bike ride that was like nickel-and-diming everyone charging like extra money for rain Insurance and extra money for like extra stuff.

593
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:45,875
Scott: Really well, so there's a thing that Ride is very reasonable.

594
00:39:45,915 --> 00:39:48,182
Scott: I paid what like $75 something like that.

595
00:39:48,242 --> 00:39:51,312
Scott: I just covered everything yep, and I could ride any distance I wanted.

596
00:39:51,855 --> 00:39:57,137
Rym: and but so like I bike a lot like as a kid like I was a mountain biker And I'm kind of getting into mountain biking again.

597
00:39:57,237 --> 00:40:03,179
Rym: like I. biking is a big hobby of mine, but it is far Far from my primary hobby.

598
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:03,822
Scott: It's not like.

599
00:40:03,963 --> 00:40:11,450
Scott: it's not my primary hobby But it is if it is warm, and I'm not doing anything, and you know it's not raining or something.

600
00:40:11,571 --> 00:40:16,806
Scott: I do that because My other hobbies I could like play video games or do it.

601
00:40:16,846 --> 00:40:17,770
Scott: I could do that anytime.

602
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:19,580
Rym: You can only bike when it's nice out.

603
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:25,674
Scott: biking is you know it's not my number one But it's close to the top and it's definitely my number one thing I do outside.

604
00:40:25,734 --> 00:40:32,808
Scott: so if it's an opportunity to be outside it becomes the number one priority to do Because when it comes winter I do it zero at all.

605
00:40:33,451 --> 00:40:39,870
Rym: But it's interesting because I've never done like a big bike ride with people whose primary hobby is biking before.

606
00:40:40,413 --> 00:40:42,810
Scott: Yeah, and I'm definitely not gonna ever care about bike racing.

607
00:40:43,091 --> 00:40:49,014
Scott: This is just a you know bike around and enjoy the scenery and some people are doing it for fitness or training reasons But no one's.

608
00:40:49,276 --> 00:40:50,789
Scott: there's no reward for coming in first.

609
00:40:51,091 --> 00:40:51,473
Scott: They don't buy.

610
00:40:51,493 --> 00:40:52,337
Scott: you know my reward was.

611
00:40:52,377 --> 00:40:55,290
Scott: it's not like a dinner like 40 minutes before you right?

612
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:58,180
Scott: I was real hungry, but it's not like one of those things.

613
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:01,010
Scott: they hand out medals to everyone even if no matter where you finish.

614
00:41:01,191 --> 00:41:13,144
Scott: Right it's absolutely not a competition anyway it's literally just come out and you can go on a bike ride that is much longer and Interesting that you could normally go on by yourself with added safety and comfort.

615
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:15,050
Scott: so at you know with with company.

616
00:41:15,231 --> 00:41:19,390
Scott: Yeah, that's the big thing is like I could just take the train up there and go on this bike ride whenever I wanted to.

617
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:20,333
Rym: Yeah, I have the route now.

618
00:41:20,393 --> 00:41:32,614
Scott: Nothing's gonna stop me, but I would not have people waiting at farms to hand me food or Put porta potties to pee Someone.

619
00:41:32,634 --> 00:41:35,370
Rym: we're kind of going the same pace and we talked for like five minutes.

620
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:44,925
Rym: Then one of us would just pull ahead and that was that I met like 20 or 30 cool people just like Biking next to them and almost every one of them started the conversation in a way.

621
00:41:44,945 --> 00:41:52,085
Scott: you all have biking in common Yep, but pretty much all of them like Pete someone who bikes and cares about biking that much is a good person.

622
00:41:52,145 --> 00:41:55,954
Rym: pretty much every one of them was like So what happened to your?

623
00:41:56,154 --> 00:41:56,956
Rym: what happened to your bike?

624
00:41:56,996 --> 00:41:57,879
Rym: because I wasn't using?

625
00:41:57,959 --> 00:42:02,430
Rym: I was I Think I would might have been the only person on the long ride who didn't have a road bike.

626
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:03,374
Scott: We weren't on the long ride.

627
00:42:03,394 --> 00:42:04,800
Scott: We're on these 72 miles.

628
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:06,970
Rym: It has a whole bunch of there's a century, right?

629
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:08,950
Scott: So this is there's a super short ride.

630
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:11,180
Scott: That's pretty much just on the rail trail and I saw.

631
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,530
Rym: I looked at the people who are on the three short.

632
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:22,169
Scott: It was like it was like children and they pretty much all had like mountain bikes and hybrids and like it's like the fun ride For kids and you know family type ride, right?

633
00:42:22,571 --> 00:42:24,658
Scott: Then there's like, I don't know what it goes in between.

634
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:33,670
Scott: but then you start to get to like medium ride like 50 miles Which is like, okay, you're gonna bike but you're not super serious about biking, but you can do it, right?

635
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:35,827
Scott: You know, you'll enjoy your whole day bike in 50 miles.

636
00:42:36,291 --> 00:42:38,430
Rym: But there were four at the top that are like the big ones.

637
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:42,789
Scott: So he did 72 which we died at 72 because that's what else is doing.

638
00:42:42,869 --> 00:42:45,343
Scott: Yep I did 72 because I was like, hey, which one are we doing?

639
00:42:45,363 --> 00:42:45,765
Scott: We're doing 72.

640
00:42:45,765 --> 00:42:49,345
Scott: I Well, that sounds good and I did it because you were doing.

641
00:42:49,365 --> 00:42:50,290
Rym: I thought about doing the centuries.

642
00:42:50,411 --> 00:42:51,234
Rym: I've never biked a hundred.

643
00:42:51,295 --> 00:42:53,766
Scott: I felt like I could do the hundred like it would take.

644
00:42:53,907 --> 00:42:57,541
Scott: I would finish it Obviously it would take me a couple hours more than the 72.

645
00:42:57,541 --> 00:42:58,585
Scott: Yeah, but it had.

646
00:42:58,645 --> 00:43:00,050
Scott: daddy two giant hills.

647
00:43:00,092 --> 00:43:06,875
Rym: Yep Now there are two versions of the century that a normal one and then a leg save and they had one with five Fucking giant hills.

648
00:43:06,936 --> 00:43:08,121
Scott: I climb over a hundred.

649
00:43:08,242 --> 00:43:09,870
Scott: challenge you climb over a mile.

650
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:13,003
Rym: Yeah, people were doing that one when they started rolling into the camp at the end.

651
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,610
Rym: They looked like grim death.

652
00:43:14,911 --> 00:43:15,373
Scott: Yeah, there was.

653
00:43:15,473 --> 00:43:16,236
Scott: these are people.

654
00:43:16,537 --> 00:43:18,765
Scott: so there was one person who did the challenge?

655
00:43:18,986 --> 00:43:20,030
Scott: who was you know?

656
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:21,502
Scott: A friend of the friends we went with.

657
00:43:21,522 --> 00:43:22,409
Scott: so I didn't really know them.

658
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:30,879
Scott: Yeah, and they finished that challenge when we were on the train home and they but they only started one hour late You know, they they they're supposed to start it at seven.

659
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:33,910
Scott: They started at eight and these were people who are super serious.

660
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:36,940
Scott: I met a lot more serious and fit than we are who.

661
00:43:37,261 --> 00:43:41,770
Rym: there's a point where people who failed on the century Could cut off and join the end.

662
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:47,110
Scott: Yeah Before if you don't if you don't finish if you're not far enough along they force you to turn at a certain point like no.

663
00:43:47,612 --> 00:43:51,790
Scott: And also I think one of the monster hills was closed for some mysterious reason.

664
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:53,615
Scott: I heard rumors about like a lost hiker.

665
00:43:53,715 --> 00:43:58,950
Rym: Yeah, I googled like brat could not find even the slightest mention of anything like that.

666
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:01,749
Scott: Yeah, I don't know what the deal was But I mean small town news, right?

667
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:06,870
Scott: But one of the hills was closed for some reason that was out of the control of the people organizing the ride now.

668
00:44:06,971 --> 00:44:13,405
Rym: so on one hand I thought oh I should do the century because like No lie, like I bike a lot and I run a lot and I'm pretty like I can.

669
00:44:13,586 --> 00:44:14,369
Scott: I can just like bike.

670
00:44:14,369 --> 00:44:17,770
Scott: 40 Miles after work on Friday would not even a problem.

671
00:44:17,851 --> 00:44:25,767
Scott: I'm like a hundred if I'm biking all day With nothing else to do but bike and I don't have to stop and I have rest stops and all the support.

672
00:44:26,048 --> 00:44:32,235
Rym: I could definitely Do a hundred because normally I do self-supported rides meaning like I have a backpack with like everything I would need if I.

673
00:44:32,316 --> 00:44:38,250
Scott: this is like now I have to carry anything But I get all the luxury of if I was carrying stuff, you know what I had?

674
00:44:38,531 --> 00:44:45,233
Rym: I had a. I had an emergency pump one tube a patch kit and one water bottle And that's it.

675
00:44:45,374 --> 00:44:50,870
Scott: I had two water bottles and a tube and a co2 cartridge and some allen wrenches.

676
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:55,248
Scott: Yeah, my entire levers entire entire levers and that's all I had.

677
00:44:55,469 --> 00:45:06,810
Rym: Yep But on the side my human body and so the 72 was like the cut like it seems like everyone above that in the entire Ride I saw one person other than me who was not on a road bike.

678
00:45:07,754 --> 00:45:12,794
Rym: One and I was looking for him and everyone I talked to was like, oh man Something happened to your bike.

679
00:45:12,814 --> 00:45:20,941
Rym: like everyone like assumed that I like broke my bike and was using my backup bike and they were like Shocked that I ride that far on a hybrid.

680
00:45:21,142 --> 00:45:21,323
Scott: Hmm.

681
00:45:21,463 --> 00:45:21,925
Scott: You can do it.

682
00:45:22,166 --> 00:45:23,090
Scott: Yeah, it was it trimming.

683
00:45:23,412 --> 00:45:25,507
Scott: It's just maybe less comfortable and less efficient.

684
00:45:25,527 --> 00:45:28,930
Rym: possibly It's definitely less efficient because you know gearing is different all that stuff.

685
00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:35,693
Rym: But at the same time I'm actually more a mountain biker than a road biker to this day because I spent most of my life Doing mountain biking.

686
00:45:36,235 --> 00:45:37,700
Scott: I'm sure you know what the thing is like.

687
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:38,522
Scott: I only had to.

688
00:45:38,823 --> 00:45:40,389
Scott: my goal was to just.

689
00:45:40,669 --> 00:45:41,449
Scott: you know It's not a race.

690
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:52,110
Scott: I didn't care how fast I went and I pretty much assumed that I would go slower than everyone else because I don't bike for Fitness or try and it seemed like other people were actually trying to go fast to at least some extent.

691
00:45:52,312 --> 00:45:53,750
Scott: Yeah, where is it when I ride my bike?

692
00:45:53,970 --> 00:46:01,608
Scott: I basically if I feel like oh This is like hurting or I'm gonna be out of breath I slow down and I just make sure that I'm always like.

693
00:46:03,653 --> 00:46:07,770
Scott: I mean, I don't really I'm personally relaxed at all times.

694
00:46:08,633 --> 00:46:14,210
Scott: So I'll go super ridiculous slow as long like if it's up a hill I just like ah this feels great.

695
00:46:14,311 --> 00:46:17,510
Scott: So even if I'm climbing the steepest hill I'm just like ah, so it was interesting.

696
00:46:17,813 --> 00:46:23,784
Scott: I was way slow compared to other people But I mean I finished what compared to Rym who runs and climbs daily.

697
00:46:23,805 --> 00:46:25,350
Rym: You were like minutes after me.

698
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:31,196
Scott: I was 30 minutes after you and that doesn't include like the fact that I stayed at rest stops longer than you did because I was Going on well.

699
00:46:31,216 --> 00:46:41,290
Rym: for so for hanging out talking to people Supported rides are the best because like every 10 or so miles there was a rest stop with like water and Gatorade Gels and food and you could just relax.

700
00:46:42,531 --> 00:46:45,022
Rym: So I waited for like we had a group of people like we met.

701
00:46:45,042 --> 00:46:58,654
Rym: all these cool people were hanging out like friends of friends or whatever and I would like wait for some of them at each stop before I went away and I Think it was the third to last rest stop or I just stopped waiting for people and just tried to power through to the end As fast as I possibly could.

702
00:46:58,956 --> 00:47:06,530
Rym: Yeah, I would not had no interest in going as fast as I like that feeling So like on that first big climb, like I pushed myself up that hill.

703
00:47:06,971 --> 00:47:09,983
Scott: Yeah, so my goal was to a whole bunch of people come.

704
00:47:10,003 --> 00:47:11,107
Rym: I was really cuz I don't like.

705
00:47:11,147 --> 00:47:11,910
Rym: I'm not super in biking.

706
00:47:12,051 --> 00:47:14,281
Rym: I was actually kind of like weird.

707
00:47:14,301 --> 00:47:16,250
Scott: Well, first of all your bike had way lower gears.

708
00:47:16,391 --> 00:47:18,561
Scott: I probably could have gotten up the hill on your bike.

709
00:47:18,622 --> 00:47:20,350
Scott: Oh, yeah, but even though it's heavier than mine.

710
00:47:20,471 --> 00:47:23,307
Rym: But I was not in that lowest gear for a lot of those climbs.

711
00:47:23,367 --> 00:47:27,210
Rym: cuz I was go I was going as fast as I could use my lowest gear often and didn't give a shit.

712
00:47:27,632 --> 00:47:30,524
Scott: Because my goal is basically cuz these I never stand up.

713
00:47:30,584 --> 00:47:31,307
Scott: I saw a lot of people.

714
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:31,870
Scott: they stand up.

715
00:47:32,311 --> 00:47:33,956
Rym: I want a steep climb like standings.

716
00:47:33,996 --> 00:47:34,277
Rym: great.

717
00:47:34,377 --> 00:47:34,999
Scott: I never stand.

718
00:47:35,039 --> 00:47:37,767
Scott: why my goal is not staying why I just standings.

719
00:47:37,807 --> 00:47:38,990
Rym: a perfectly valid technique.

720
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:40,920
Scott: I just don't stand right and then weird.

721
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:41,604
Rym: I mean, I don't walk.

722
00:47:41,664 --> 00:47:42,086
Rym: That's my thing.

723
00:47:42,126 --> 00:47:42,709
Rym: I will never walk.

724
00:47:42,974 --> 00:47:43,409
Scott: I'll see him.

725
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:45,176
Scott: I usually I would never walk.

726
00:47:45,457 --> 00:47:57,580
Scott: but that hill was just at such a steepness that in my lowest gear While I was sitting I could not turn the pedal If I push pull push pull and just really get up.

727
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,528
Scott: if I stood I could have gotten up easily if I had.

728
00:48:01,752 --> 00:48:06,658
Scott: You know, you know knowing that the hill is gonna be that steep I probably could have maybe done a zigzag or something.

729
00:48:06,679 --> 00:48:07,361
Scott: cuz it basically comes.

730
00:48:07,562 --> 00:48:13,110
Scott: you turn a corner and there it is and I saw Someone else walking and I'm just like, oh well, but I only walked up the one hill.

731
00:48:13,352 --> 00:48:17,319
Rym: I did not walk at any point and I also did not run into trouble at any point.

732
00:48:17,339 --> 00:48:22,185
Rym: cuz there's one section way near the end Where the road like the trail was real shitty and covered in gravel.

733
00:48:22,406 --> 00:48:23,250
Scott: That was the shitty part.

734
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:25,480
Rym: Yeah, but the funny thing is because I was on a hybrid.

735
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:31,603
Scott: I was just like whoosh didn't even think about it Have too much problem with the gravel but I had to really look at the ground to avoid.

736
00:48:31,684 --> 00:48:35,919
Rym: I saw four different people get Flat tires like on that one spot.

737
00:48:35,939 --> 00:48:38,910
Scott: I didn't get a flat tire, but I was basically at that part.

738
00:48:38,991 --> 00:48:41,266
Scott: I was chillin with some people who were on a tandem bike.

739
00:48:41,628 --> 00:48:42,797
Scott: Oh And I was just.

740
00:48:42,858 --> 00:48:48,069
Scott: I was like, whoa awesome tandem bike Whoo, and then suddenly they stopped and they're like just behind me.

741
00:48:48,331 --> 00:48:50,342
Scott: So then I stopped and I'm like, whoa, you guys are right.

742
00:48:50,443 --> 00:48:55,970
Scott: and then I realized Everyone else was turning off the gravel on onto the rail trail again.

743
00:48:55,990 --> 00:49:01,510
Scott: And I'm like, oh they know if I didn't if I hadn't noticed them stopping I would have totally missed that turn-off right there.

744
00:49:01,671 --> 00:49:03,490
Rym: Yep, I almost followed it way toward the end.

745
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:03,731
Scott: It's all.

746
00:49:03,751 --> 00:49:06,830
Scott: the directions are painted on the ground, but they don't paint on the gravel.

747
00:49:07,011 --> 00:49:09,610
Scott: Yeah, the paint was on the pavement off to the side.

748
00:49:11,177 --> 00:49:14,436
Rym: I was I was following this guy for a while Like I was just kind of.

749
00:49:14,497 --> 00:49:22,920
Rym: I wasn't like drafting him But I was like following him because you can you can think less and focus more on the scenery if you keep like someone else Who's going at a good pace for you?

750
00:49:23,262 --> 00:49:24,570
Rym: Just like in your peripheral vision.

751
00:49:25,092 --> 00:49:35,510
Scott: So I like to follow someone because if I'm by myself I'd every now and then I'm like like There are a lot of times where I was alone and there wasn't a direction on the street for a long time and you had.

752
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:36,136
Scott: Then one would come.

753
00:49:36,156 --> 00:49:37,710
Scott: you have the cue sheet, right?

754
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:38,154
Scott: I didn't.

755
00:49:38,195 --> 00:49:39,109
Scott: I lost my leg right away.

756
00:49:39,512 --> 00:49:56,777
Scott: I have mine but never had to check it because every time I thought I might have been lost someone appeared or some direction appeared on the ground or direction from a previous year that was faded was on the ground and then I when I got to the end on Strava the map exactly matched a hundred percent Super accurately the map on the website.

757
00:49:56,817 --> 00:49:58,843
Scott: It even said exactly 72 miles.

758
00:49:59,084 --> 00:50:00,107
Scott: Yeah, 72 point.

759
00:50:00,287 --> 00:50:02,165
Scott: Oh, I was like damn That's some accurate map.

760
00:50:02,185 --> 00:50:05,603
Rym: right there My Strava says seventy two point four in the end and I looked.

761
00:50:05,925 --> 00:50:07,190
Rym: there's a spot toward the end.

762
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:16,600
Rym: The only time I stopped outside of rest off the entire time I pulled my bike like to pee in the woods twenty or thirty feet down this like driveway and then walked into the woods Peed forever.

763
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:17,810
Scott: I just peed on the side of the road.

764
00:50:18,051 --> 00:50:18,333
Rym: I went.

765
00:50:18,393 --> 00:50:25,330
Scott: I went off the road even though I the thing is like I peed at every rest stop But at that I had to pee again because I drank too much water.

766
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:27,358
Rym: Yeah, well at the end like I was getting pretty tired.

767
00:50:27,398 --> 00:50:30,309
Rym: So I drank a lot of water and that was a mistake.

768
00:50:30,912 --> 00:50:31,535
Scott: I wasn't tired.

769
00:50:31,575 --> 00:50:39,010
Scott: I was like when I got to the end I was like, ah, I'm into the end I was tired, but in that long flat section near the end, I tried to go fast.

770
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:40,957
Scott: Well, I didn't actually was surprising.

771
00:50:41,017 --> 00:50:44,390
Scott: is that even you know, obviously I was you know more fatigued.

772
00:50:44,611 --> 00:50:46,729
Scott: I didn't feel like tired and like I need to go to sleep.

773
00:50:47,172 --> 00:50:51,170
Scott: My body was clearly more fatigued closer to the end because I had biked already seventy miles.

774
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:57,770
Scott: Yeah, but when I got in the rail trail itself, it was covered in shade and the pavement on it was different for some reason.

775
00:50:58,039 --> 00:51:02,190
Rym: Oh, yeah I just started going faster there on the good parts that were technically rail trail.

776
00:51:02,671 --> 00:51:13,470
Scott: I was just going faster while still being comfortable because I think of the shade and the pavement something about it was just like Oh, you can go faster here because it appears the pavement on the street was I guess, you know, not as good.

777
00:51:13,651 --> 00:51:13,992
Scott: I don't know.

778
00:51:14,253 --> 00:51:15,016
Rym: So the cool thing is like.

779
00:51:15,057 --> 00:51:18,150
Rym: all the other people we were with are like way more like biking is their main.

780
00:51:18,652 --> 00:51:21,989
Scott: Yeah, I mean Katie was like I biked every weekend this summer.

781
00:51:22,432 --> 00:51:23,158
Scott: Yeah, I didn't do.

782
00:51:23,218 --> 00:51:24,509
Scott: I didn't hang out with my non Viking.

783
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:28,730
Rym: I don't think I'd ever biked more than 60 or so miles in one go ever.

784
00:51:28,810 --> 00:51:38,470
Scott: The thing is they also I think they did this program in New York that the New York Cycle Club does called the SIG Which has like different groups a B and C and it's a free program.

785
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:41,928
Scott: but like they teach you how to group ride for serious the a group is like.

786
00:51:42,531 --> 00:51:46,610
Scott: We teach you how to like form pace lines and we'll kick you out if you're too slow and stuff, right?

787
00:51:47,051 --> 00:51:55,529
Scott: But they did the B one I think which is why they knew to like have these clips to hold their cue sheet on their Handlebars like they learned all this stuff there that we didn't learn.

788
00:51:56,072 --> 00:51:59,988
Scott: But I went to the website cuz like they kept trying to push me to do it.

789
00:52:00,028 --> 00:52:01,561
Scott: like Scott You should really do the SIG.

790
00:52:01,581 --> 00:52:02,389
Scott: Oh, you should do it.

791
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:06,230
Scott: I went to the website to check it out last year the first first of all.

792
00:52:06,270 --> 00:52:09,350
Scott: It's a 10-week thing or 12 and you have to do every week.

793
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:11,589
Scott: You can't really miss it or else you get kicked out.

794
00:52:12,112 --> 00:52:15,590
Scott: The very first week of it last year was the PAX East weekend.

795
00:52:15,791 --> 00:52:17,195
Scott: Well, and it's just like.

796
00:52:17,235 --> 00:52:22,210
Scott: well and it's also like it starts in March at the beginning of March when it's cold.

797
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:27,183
Scott: Yeah, you gotta buy some you know, like equipment to go bike in the cold.

798
00:52:27,203 --> 00:52:28,587
Scott: Otherwise, you're gonna quit.

799
00:52:28,607 --> 00:52:33,990
Scott: Yeah But yeah, that's that's why you know, I think that's where a lot of them met or whatever.

800
00:52:34,323 --> 00:52:41,353
Rym: Yep but in terms like I Realized pretty well on that a lot of the people on this trail like not just the people were hanging out with but like everyone I talked to along the way.

801
00:52:41,795 --> 00:52:54,849
Rym: biking is definitely like their primary or sole hobby, but specifically this kind of biking No one I talked to it ever mountain biked and no one like all the jargon about like trail riding or single track.

802
00:52:54,889 --> 00:52:55,230
Rym: like no one.

803
00:52:55,370 --> 00:52:56,434
Rym: Any what I was talking about?

804
00:52:56,454 --> 00:52:57,276
Rym: They only do this.

805
00:52:57,296 --> 00:52:59,403
Rym: I remember I two different people.

806
00:52:59,423 --> 00:53:01,028
Rym: I ended up sort of like.

807
00:53:01,068 --> 00:53:01,610
Rym: they were curious.

808
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:08,009
Rym: I just explaining in detail like how mountain biking works like yeah You don't clip in you just put your feet on and they're like terrified of that and it was just.

809
00:53:08,694 --> 00:53:13,658
Rym: It's interesting to see these people have a very narrow and deep Hobby because I pretty much you're just like.

810
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:16,650
Rym: I'm not super deep on anything and I'm just all over the place on everything.

811
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:19,019
Scott: I'm sure those people have other hobbies besides bike.

812
00:53:19,039 --> 00:53:20,203
Scott: Yeah, but they're just.

813
00:53:20,223 --> 00:53:24,766
Scott: they're just way more into biking No, but only this kind of biking like I do.

814
00:53:24,806 --> 00:53:25,410
Rym: all kinds of rice.

815
00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:26,716
Scott: The thing is they care about.

816
00:53:26,776 --> 00:53:27,942
Scott: a lot of those people care about.

817
00:53:27,962 --> 00:53:28,243
Rym: as a kid.

818
00:53:28,324 --> 00:53:29,670
Rym: I used to like BMX biking.

819
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:31,496
Scott: I don't care about biking itself.

820
00:53:31,537 --> 00:53:32,500
Scott: Whereas for me.

821
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:45,050
Scott: It's like yeah, I do enjoy biking But I'm like I was looking at the scenery more than I was trying to you know Check the time or worry about my body's health or any of that nonsense, right?

822
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:46,997
Scott: I'm just like whoa cuz like you.

823
00:53:47,037 --> 00:53:47,338
Scott: go out to.

824
00:53:47,358 --> 00:53:50,230
Scott: this place was Millerton, New York and the surrounding towns.

825
00:53:50,655 --> 00:53:51,870
Scott: It's like farms.

826
00:53:52,351 --> 00:54:00,268
Scott: There were a few places very definition of bucolic and pest or there were a few places where their houses next to each other But there was a lot of trees.

827
00:54:01,391 --> 00:54:10,750
Rym: There's one spot where it like you get to the top of this mountain and it's like it says it was a slog to get Up there and we finally get to the top and then you kind of come over the crest and then there's a spray paint.

828
00:54:10,770 --> 00:54:17,175
Rym: That says two miles straight down fly But along like right around there There was another spray paint.

829
00:54:17,195 --> 00:54:18,942
Rym: that said look at an arrow to your left.

830
00:54:19,263 --> 00:54:24,912
Rym: in case like you're so focused on the ride You look to your left and it's like the most gorgeous Farmland.

831
00:54:24,993 --> 00:54:38,190
Scott: like there's a pond in the distance horses and cows Mostly horses up there, but then later on cows indoor cows and more cows all the goats All the rest stops seem to be in cooperation with certain farms.

832
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:44,058
Scott: It's like you go and you stop it like the horse farm and the people who run the horse farm were out there running the rest up.

833
00:54:45,652 --> 00:54:50,855
Scott: one of the rest stops is way better than the others in a misting tent and That's the one with ice right?

834
00:54:50,876 --> 00:54:51,418
Scott: It had ice.

835
00:54:51,921 --> 00:54:52,885
Scott: The other ones didn't have ice.

836
00:54:52,905 --> 00:54:53,749
Scott: This one had ice.

837
00:54:54,892 --> 00:54:58,670
Scott: So and one of the rest ups is sadder than the others and they're like the bare minimum amount of stuff.

838
00:54:58,792 --> 00:54:59,648
Scott: I should have skipped that one.

839
00:55:00,358 --> 00:55:08,050
Scott: But yeah The actual camp place where you like start is like the baseball field of Millerton is like the town park.

840
00:55:08,131 --> 00:55:09,508
Scott: I guess that's where we camped.

841
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:10,334
Scott: You don't have to camp.

842
00:55:10,375 --> 00:55:11,582
Scott: a lot of people stayed in hotels.

843
00:55:11,602 --> 00:55:14,535
Rym: like the vast majority of people Live in the area and drive.

844
00:55:14,616 --> 00:55:23,850
Scott: in the vast majority people just drove there Sunday morning got out and biked whereas we had went there Saturday woke up and biked Going there and camping is definitely the superior method.

845
00:55:23,938 --> 00:55:30,214
Rym: Yes There aren't that many people camping and it's like this really chill vibe and when we woke up in the morning is like there was Awesome breakfast.

846
00:55:30,274 --> 00:55:34,330
Scott: Yeah, it wasn't like the greatest breakfast ever, but it was like band camp breakfast.

847
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:37,162
Scott: The bagel was way better than streetcar bagel.

848
00:55:37,222 --> 00:55:38,608
Scott: Although it wasn't greatest bagel ever.

849
00:55:38,748 --> 00:55:43,830
Scott: It was free Of course, right every note and like they were actually making like French toast there, which is way good.

850
00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:45,259
Scott: The bacon was really sad.

851
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,285
Rym: sausage was good though.

852
00:55:46,305 --> 00:55:47,170
Rym: I should eat more of that sauce.

853
00:55:48,071 --> 00:55:52,867
Scott: But and then when we got back afterwards just bbq, yeah, it was really.

854
00:55:52,927 --> 00:55:57,201
Scott: it wasn't the kind of barbecue I had for lunch today, right but it was like it was pretty good.

855
00:55:57,241 --> 00:56:04,450
Scott: It's like, alright, I got a sausage and onions And the thing is like it like they do all this stuff to like help you out.

856
00:56:04,550 --> 00:56:10,993
Scott: It's like when we arrived on the train to get there They were there with a van because we called them Yeah Take all

857
00:56:11,013 --> 00:56:11,254
Rym: of our

858
00:56:11,354 --> 00:56:25,250
Scott: stuff except our bikes so that we could bike on the rail trail to get from the train in Wasek to Millerton and then when we had to go back home to New York They put our bikes in a pickup truck put us in a van and drove all of us to the train station.

859
00:56:25,692 --> 00:56:26,495
Scott: Like for nothing.

860
00:56:26,776 --> 00:56:30,710
Scott: just like, you know, that's just what they do and it was super organized and they actually took care.

861
00:56:30,891 --> 00:56:32,720
Rym: Yeah, like getting the bikes like everything.

862
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:34,770
Scott: everything happened on time perfectly.

863
00:56:35,091 --> 00:56:40,995
Rym: They exhibited the PAX tabletop enforcer mantra make it fit Yeah and they made it fairly.

864
00:56:41,035 --> 00:56:48,016
Scott: this operation is like actually only run by two people and I guess everyone else was just like volunteers or staff of some kind helping out.

865
00:56:48,076 --> 00:56:56,350
Scott: but like there were so many people helping out this vans driving around checking like if you You would you would like biking and you'd see nothing for like miles.

866
00:56:56,531 --> 00:57:00,808
Scott: But if you stopped and waited a van would eventually just drive by like and like be hey thumbs up.

867
00:57:00,828 --> 00:57:01,110
Rym: You're good.

868
00:57:01,411 --> 00:57:02,838
Scott: Yeah, like you need something from us.

869
00:57:02,959 --> 00:57:04,125
Scott: It's like a whole van full of help.

870
00:57:04,145 --> 00:57:05,110
Scott: They were just driving everywhere.

871
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:18,429
Rym: I'm glad I didn't have trouble cuz actually my front tire is still the original tire from when I bought this bike and it's pretty Original tire original tube, I bought that bike some time ago.

872
00:57:18,690 --> 00:57:25,780
Scott: But yeah, you know regardless of your biking athletic skill, right if you live in New York You can go to this specific ride.

873
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:28,376
Rym: It's where unless it's gonna rain that weekend I'm definitely doing it again.

874
00:57:28,396 --> 00:57:34,099
Scott: rise by the fun, you know based on where you live I'm sure you can find rides similar to this.

875
00:57:34,179 --> 00:57:35,202
Scott: Just don't do one in like.

876
00:57:35,222 --> 00:57:41,630
Scott: I don't know Colorado or Vermont or some places made of mountains Switzerland.

877
00:57:42,755 --> 00:57:43,397
Scott: Do it someplace.

878
00:57:43,438 --> 00:57:44,824
Scott: that's at least mostly flat ish.

879
00:57:45,165 --> 00:57:49,402
Rym: an interesting sort of side point Is that the websites like good in some ways like.

880
00:57:49,422 --> 00:57:55,442
Rym: it has a lot of info like there's a lot of stuff here But it also lacks all the like really pertinent details.

881
00:57:56,064 --> 00:58:01,947
Rym: that only means God seemed to care about Like everyone else like bike community just trusted like oh, yeah, it'll work.

882
00:58:02,007 --> 00:58:02,630
Rym: It'll just work out.

883
00:58:02,731 --> 00:58:04,670
Scott: But I think that they've a lot of people done this before.

884
00:58:05,891 --> 00:58:07,397
Scott: Partly there are hundreds of people doing.

885
00:58:07,417 --> 00:58:09,405
Rym: you know how my hobby has failed conventions.

886
00:58:09,687 --> 00:58:14,861
Scott: Yeah, like Opposite this is run so professionally like even the first packs we went to.

887
00:58:14,881 --> 00:58:18,257
Rym: I was like reading every detail on that website like okay It's in this building.

888
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:19,489
Rym: It starts at this time.

889
00:58:20,052 --> 00:58:23,726
Rym: Get my badge will be here because of this like I'm so like and this.

890
00:58:23,806 --> 00:58:27,222
Rym: it was just like yeah I just show up in camp and I'm like, well, when can I show up?

891
00:58:27,262 --> 00:58:28,790
Rym: and it turns out it doesn't matter to show up.

892
00:58:28,850 --> 00:58:32,942
Scott: Apparently some people show up early on Saturday bike on Saturday and then bike on Sunday.

893
00:58:33,022 --> 00:58:38,941
Rym: Yeah, I think next year I'd show up like a Several hours earlier on Saturday, but not like crack of dawn.

894
00:58:39,583 --> 00:58:41,470
Rym: get there like late afternoon.

895
00:58:42,212 --> 00:58:45,182
Scott: You could do like some you know, like a nice 20 30 mile pre-ride.

896
00:58:45,202 --> 00:58:47,710
Rym: Yeah, maybe play some bocce or something.

897
00:58:47,816 --> 00:58:49,704
Scott: Yeah someone was playing some people.

898
00:58:49,724 --> 00:58:53,602
Scott: I Think this family had brought a game that I hadn't heard of that.

899
00:58:53,622 --> 00:58:58,883
Scott: I looked up and it's called Something ladder with the bolo's.

900
00:58:58,923 --> 00:59:08,709
Scott: you basically have a bowl It was like three sticks Vertically and you have a bolo which is two balls with a rope attached to each other and you're trying to Throw it and get it to catch on the the thing.

901
00:59:09,934 --> 00:59:14,819
Scott: So it looked really fun But you should have brought some cub Because I planned like.

902
00:59:14,859 --> 00:59:15,541
Rym: I didn't plan like.

903
00:59:15,562 --> 00:59:17,870
Rym: I didn't actually like commit until like right before.

904
00:59:18,314 --> 00:59:19,121
Rym: So I bought my like.

905
00:59:19,141 --> 00:59:23,145
Rym: I registered on Thursday Which I think was the last day to register before the price increase.

906
00:59:23,205 --> 00:59:30,870
Rym: like if you did it the day Oh, if you do day of it's a hundred bucks and then 75 I thought I'll maybe I'll stay at a motel and I was like, oh, no, that's stupid.

907
00:59:31,111 --> 00:59:32,458
Rym: So I had to go like buy a tent.

908
00:59:32,598 --> 00:59:36,562
Scott: you didn't have to buy a tent you could just borrowed, you know The tent I was in was a two people tent.

909
00:59:36,582 --> 00:59:37,267
Scott: you could have stayed in that.

910
00:59:37,469 --> 00:59:39,097
Rym: Yeah Well, I asked you like how big a tent?

911
00:59:39,118 --> 00:59:42,979
Rym: I didn't know that you were like, I don't know and I can't trust that I'm not gonna risk it.

912
00:59:43,582 --> 00:59:44,770
Scott: Okay, you know you just like buying stuff.

913
00:59:44,891 --> 00:59:47,350
Rym: No, I didn't need a tent cuz I do plan to do some camping.

914
00:59:47,631 --> 00:59:49,617
Scott: I just borrowed my friend and I do have.

915
00:59:49,657 --> 01:00:01,530
Rym: my mom has all my old like camping and tent stuff and I thought maybe I want to mail it to me and like Emily's parents have like a hurled stuff, but I went and bought cuz they're not that expensive like a modern backpacking tent.

916
01:00:02,410 --> 01:00:05,710
Rym: Holy shit has that technology gotten better in the last 20 years?

917
01:00:05,710 --> 01:00:06,793
Scott: Yeah Despite not like.

918
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:13,721
Scott: I was afraid I haven't put together a tent in so long and any tent I've put together has not been Complicated or was old-style.

919
01:00:13,741 --> 01:00:15,470
Scott: I had I put together my friend.

920
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:23,990
Scott: I was worried about breaking it because it wasn't my tent and it was no and it's like with no instructions whatsoever This expensive tent belonging to my friend that I was afraid to break.

921
01:00:24,111 --> 01:00:24,292
Scott: I was.

922
01:00:24,393 --> 01:00:33,704
Rym: I put it together perfectly from the first try just like boop Yep but no instruction was up in like 30 seconds and the rest of the time was me fucking with it and like Making sure cuz I wasn't convinced.

923
01:00:33,845 --> 01:00:36,721
Scott: It was like whoa It's that was really easy and not a problem at all

924
01:00:36,983 --> 01:00:56,090
Rym: and we could see stars but like basically I didn't own any modern equipment because I haven't done like serious camping since I was a kid and all the stuff that I own through my family is old enough to where the technology is vastly superior today like my Hiking backpack is an external frame, which is like a monster by modern.

925
01:00:56,211 --> 01:01:00,230
Scott: I think I have a sleeping bag that I used in the desert from the year 2000.

926
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:02,339
Scott: Yeah, that sleeping bag is probably garbage.

927
01:01:02,399 --> 01:01:08,523
Rym: I went looked at modern sleeping bags like the world changed Yeah, but I didn't buy a sleeping bag cuz I don't need like.

928
01:01:08,543 --> 01:01:12,577
Rym: I'm not gonna do winter camping ever again No, so it's I enjoyed.

929
01:01:12,697 --> 01:01:16,970
Scott: it was a little bit colder than I thought but it was still warm enough that I made it.

930
01:01:17,491 --> 01:01:28,206
Rym: I bought a sleep sack, which is basically like a tiny sleeping bag that you can stuff in like a really tiny space But it only works if it's like 50 degrees or more like below.

931
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:32,789
Rym: that it won't help you Mmm, and it was actually really cheap like I got it on a sale at REI.

932
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:37,610
Rym: But basically I went like bought this stuff and now actually I might do a camping trip like right after packed.

933
01:01:37,691 --> 01:01:38,727
Rym: So it's kind of good that I got this.

934
01:01:39,833 --> 01:01:41,850
Rym: The only problem was that I have the sleeping pads.

935
01:01:42,011 --> 01:01:43,518
Rym: Like you don't want to sleep on grass directly.

936
01:01:43,859 --> 01:01:46,090
Rym: usually even in a tent like that's not comfortable.

937
01:01:46,951 --> 01:01:50,850
Rym: So I needed like a sleeping mat and I had to silence got one.

938
01:01:50,890 --> 01:01:54,950
Rym: But the ones I got are pretty big because they're like the luxury cover.

939
01:01:54,970 --> 01:01:55,856
Scott: Yeah, this is one.

940
01:01:55,876 --> 01:01:56,983
Scott: an Amazon is green.

941
01:01:57,124 --> 01:01:58,110
Scott: that goes way smaller.

942
01:01:58,130 --> 01:01:59,176
Scott: I'm gonna get up cuz.

943
01:01:59,197 --> 01:02:01,410
Rym: this is the one I'll bring to like feed Nuri's house.

944
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:08,870
Rym: So I'm gonna sleep on their floor Yeah, but I'm not necessarily or like winter camping because it's crazy insulated, but not carrying that like on my backpack.

945
01:02:09,452 --> 01:02:18,184
Scott: Yeah other funny things the people we were with they were all they spent like the whole time having the same conversation About this creepy dude.

946
01:02:18,305 --> 01:02:19,413
Rym: Oh my god I got.

947
01:02:19,474 --> 01:02:21,570
Scott: it's like all they could talk about was his creepy, dude.

948
01:02:21,610 --> 01:02:26,050
Rym: Well partly cuz Scott they has the gnosis of like creepy dude lore.

949
01:02:26,253 --> 01:02:35,949
Scott: Well, they they were in you know They did some biking event with this dude, right and afterwards the dude I guess messaged them all like in succession like trying to ask them out

950
01:02:36,692 --> 01:02:37,535
Rym: Yeah,

951
01:02:37,555 --> 01:02:44,659
Scott: and then of course now here at the biking event all of them are together and they're like We all got messages from the same creepy dude.

952
01:02:44,699 --> 01:02:51,163
Rym: really one of them was reading an email out loud and Scott's like there's warning signs There I'm like, that's creepy dude.

953
01:02:51,183 --> 01:02:52,509
Scott: So that was that was a funny story.

954
01:02:53,492 --> 01:02:54,683
Scott: another funny story was.

955
01:02:56,813 --> 01:02:58,470
Scott: I don't know were there any other funny stories.

956
01:02:58,752 --> 01:03:01,510
Scott: I was like trying to think like, you know, you think you do something like this like weird stuff.

957
01:03:01,530 --> 01:03:01,911
Scott: What how?

958
01:03:02,172 --> 01:03:04,280
Scott: there was this really awesome dog that I thought?

959
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:13,690
Scott: Oh, yeah that like but that austere Was like an enormous dog sitting at the end of a driveway that I buy a nine I described and I was like.

960
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:16,044
Scott: It was like he really guarded the driveway, but he like wasn't?

961
01:03:16,064 --> 01:03:16,990
Scott: you know, it wasn't misbehaving.

962
01:03:17,070 --> 01:03:20,225
Scott: It's like whoa, that is like the awesomest dog right there.

963
01:03:20,245 --> 01:03:23,790
Scott: Yeah There were horses, but they didn't bother anybody.

964
01:03:23,971 --> 01:03:28,170
Rym: Well, they came over like bothering people for treats and when no one gave him a truth, they're like and they just left.

965
01:03:28,614 --> 01:03:29,909
Rym: They're like no one's giving me an apple.

966
01:03:31,391 --> 01:03:32,556
Scott: What else happened there?

967
01:03:32,957 --> 01:03:37,529
Rym: I mean it just was fun time hanging out with a bunch of strangers swapping stories.

968
01:03:38,531 --> 01:03:39,877
Scott: There was a music guy at the end.

969
01:03:39,917 --> 01:03:43,290
Scott: He was actually really like quite a good musician, but was too loud.

970
01:03:43,310 --> 01:03:48,611
Scott: So it was hard to talk when you're hanging out as loud as like other kinds of it was like it was a metal concert Loud.

971
01:03:48,671 --> 01:03:53,407
Scott: it was just slightly difficult to talk to each other, you know hanging out at the end loud.

972
01:03:53,428 --> 01:03:55,012
Rym: Yep It's partly.

973
01:03:55,052 --> 01:03:56,717
Rym: it's very usually the circles.

974
01:03:56,777 --> 01:04:06,847
Rym: I hang out with with strangers are more on the gamer or technology side Very rarely on the sports side because most of the sports I do either do solo or I do with friends.

975
01:04:06,907 --> 01:04:11,363
Rym: like most of my Biking is alone self-supported or me and Emily's self-supported.

976
01:04:12,066 --> 01:04:18,610
Rym: and like skiing I mostly do by myself like I only on ski trips with other people other than Emily like twice a year tops.

977
01:04:19,751 --> 01:04:27,909
Rym: And this year like it was like I know it like I imagine doing all the other sports that I mostly do solo With all the people who do those sports and I think that would actually be fun.

978
01:04:28,352 --> 01:04:29,018
Rym: That's enough time.

979
01:04:29,118 --> 01:04:30,449
Rym: just do other stuff.

980
01:04:31,096 --> 01:04:32,190
Scott: Oh, oh, that's right.

981
01:04:32,210 --> 01:04:35,269
Scott: The other thing is so we all had to take our bikes on the train.

982
01:04:35,933 --> 01:04:38,705
Scott: The Metro North trains I measure North was not ready for us.

983
01:04:38,826 --> 01:04:39,630
Scott: on the way up.

984
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:49,382
Scott: It wasn't really a big deal because there weren't that many other bikers on our train But on the way back because like everyone arrived at different times taking different trains But on the way back is pretty much like everyone.

985
01:04:49,402 --> 01:04:56,910
Scott: there are two trains going back Basically and most of us are on this six o'clock train Like 50 bikes we like filled the bed.

986
01:04:57,032 --> 01:05:03,230
Scott: They you know The MTA technically has rules about like eight bikes per train or you per car or something like that.

987
01:05:03,371 --> 01:05:06,610
Scott: It's not a high number but like we friggin it was crazy.

988
01:05:06,670 --> 01:05:12,330
Scott: We filled the back of this Metro North train with bikes and all the seats and doctors were pretty not cool.

989
01:05:12,471 --> 01:05:13,254
Rym: It like they want to know.

990
01:05:13,294 --> 01:05:14,780
Scott: they you know, they they allowed it.

991
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:15,201
Scott: They were just.

992
01:05:15,241 --> 01:05:17,269
Rym: they were definitely annoyed by it.

993
01:05:17,722 --> 01:05:17,910
Rym: You know

994
01:05:17,930 --> 01:05:19,236
Scott: it was a hassle for them and

995
01:05:19,256 --> 01:05:43,010
Rym: then a lot of the people who got on the train later because the train complete basically completely Filled because this is like all the people who did upstate crap on a Sunday coming back into the city and the train shows up Basically full of bikes and though so the funniest thing actually on the way there We were on the train right and like we do our transfer and everything and this old man like I'm Away from everyone else by myself because I I talked to the doctor and I just like put my bike like in the empty car.

996
01:05:43,111 --> 01:05:45,510
Rym: That was roped off and that was way pleasant.

997
01:05:46,012 --> 01:05:51,834
Rym: But as I'm leaving this old man who was sitting there with Scott and then we're with the bike with the other bikes He goes the conductor.

998
01:05:51,875 --> 01:05:53,441
Rym: He's like, how can you let this happen?

999
01:05:53,481 --> 01:05:54,445
Rym: The conductor is like what?

1000
01:05:54,887 --> 01:05:57,102
Rym: and he's like Why are there bikes on this train?

1001
01:05:57,122 --> 01:05:57,646
Rym: They're in the way.

1002
01:05:57,687 --> 01:05:58,110
Rym: It's rude.

1003
01:05:58,110 --> 01:06:03,890
Rym: They're getting the seats and he's like this guy was so pissed that there were bikes on the train.

1004
01:06:03,910 --> 01:06:07,110
Scott: We'll just get pissed by things that are out of the ordinary and make them angry.

1005
01:06:07,311 --> 01:06:10,750
Scott: And then when we were in the talk about this literally all the time is the old.

1006
01:06:10,810 --> 01:06:12,960
Scott: This is the thing that is talked about the most.

1007
01:06:13,583 --> 01:06:15,150
Scott: Why do we need to keep talking about it?

1008
01:06:15,270 --> 01:06:23,170
Scott: There are people in this world who are dumb, angry, averse to change, averse to newness.

1009
01:06:23,472 --> 01:06:29,001
Rym: But the fact that he said anything that is unroutined The exact words he said were to the conductor.

1010
01:06:29,383 --> 01:06:31,430
Rym: How could you let this happen?

1011
01:06:33,731 --> 01:06:39,589
Rym: That's the kind of thing you say when like someone gets hit by the train or like a gunfight breaks out.

1012
01:06:40,252 --> 01:06:43,124
Rym: That's not something you say because you saw a bike.

1013
01:06:43,626 --> 01:06:44,710
Scott: The people are fragile.

1014
01:06:45,595 --> 01:06:48,363
Scott: Yeah Something's out of the ordinary.

1015
01:06:48,404 --> 01:06:48,808
Scott: Oh my god.

1016
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:58,316
Rym: But no, this was super super fun and I really like biking and I think I had to replace my clip shoes because the toes Like the clips are fine.

1017
01:06:58,356 --> 01:07:02,190
Rym: Like everything's fine, but my toes I've almost broken through the front of the shoes.

1018
01:07:02,834 --> 01:07:05,069
Rym: I think I've just worn them out from using them for so many years.

1019
01:07:05,732 --> 01:07:07,038
Scott: Mine are like the problem with mine.

1020
01:07:07,058 --> 01:07:09,589
Scott: There's nothing wrong with them, but it's like they're the right length.

1021
01:07:10,532 --> 01:07:19,456
Scott: but They are Things like super super tight Purpose.

1022
01:07:19,597 --> 01:07:21,150
Rym: I ordered like five from Zappos.

1023
01:07:22,312 --> 01:07:25,844
Scott: I did the same thing and the ones that were one size smaller.

1024
01:07:26,084 --> 01:07:27,730
Scott: My toe was like bumping up against the front.

1025
01:07:28,273 --> 01:07:36,590
Scott: Ah, you know why I kept the ones that I have But I think I might have to just buy like a different brand next time if they can't get narrow ones or something.

1026
01:07:36,731 --> 01:07:38,678
Scott: Yeah, you know maybe next year.

1027
01:07:38,698 --> 01:07:43,858
Rym: I mean my one pair is sort of like I might get a pair that's less walkable But just more like biker.

1028
01:07:43,958 --> 01:07:51,530
Scott: Also my helmet which is only a few years old and it's still you know It's still perfectly great like the fuzzy stuff on the inside is all like destroyed.

1029
01:07:52,152 --> 01:07:53,990
Scott: So I'm like, I don't want to buy a new helmet.

1030
01:07:54,030 --> 01:07:55,946
Scott: They're not cheap and there's nothing wrong with this one.

1031
01:07:56,491 --> 01:08:00,098
Scott: But so I wonder if I can just get replacement Cushion parts for the inside.

1032
01:08:00,118 --> 01:08:06,347
Rym: I was about to type in to find out how often Bike helmet should be replaced because there's probably some like specific guidance on there.

1033
01:08:06,448 --> 01:08:10,099
Rym: Yeah The recommendation searches for how often are.

1034
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:11,142
Rym: how often should you change your oil?

1035
01:08:11,263 --> 01:08:11,785
Rym: it makes sense.

1036
01:08:12,407 --> 01:08:13,390
Rym: How often should you shower?

1037
01:08:14,110 --> 01:08:15,014
Rym: How often should you poop?

1038
01:08:15,476 --> 01:08:17,464
Scott: You should poop like once every day or two.

1039
01:08:17,604 --> 01:08:20,357
Rym: Yeah 1.5 times a day on average I feel like is a good metric.

1040
01:08:20,397 --> 01:08:23,170
Scott: Yeah, I don't need to Google for this bike helmet.

1041
01:08:23,270 --> 01:08:24,910
Rym: All right, how often should you replace a bike helmet?

1042
01:08:26,511 --> 01:08:27,035
Rym: Five years.

1043
01:08:27,457 --> 01:08:27,698
Scott: It's not.

1044
01:08:27,719 --> 01:08:28,886
Scott: I don't think mine is five years old.

1045
01:08:29,006 --> 01:08:31,876
Scott: Mine is Three years old I want to say.

1046
01:08:31,895 --> 01:08:32,519
Scott: Yeah, I don't.

1047
01:08:32,538 --> 01:08:34,910
Scott: I think mine might be only two or three years old at this point.

1048
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:36,410
Scott: I bought it recently.

1049
01:08:37,390 --> 01:08:39,477
Scott: One that I replaced was well over five.

1050
01:08:39,497 --> 01:08:43,729
Scott: Yeah, the one I replaced might have been like nine or ten years old.

1051
01:08:44,451 --> 01:08:45,975
Rym: Yeah, oh this side is funny.

1052
01:08:45,996 --> 01:08:46,618
Rym: helmets.org.

1053
01:08:46,638 --> 01:08:47,421
Rym: When should I replace?

1054
01:08:47,801 --> 01:08:50,210
Rym: When should I replace my helmet and has a list of questions?

1055
01:08:50,830 --> 01:08:51,448
Rym: Did you crash?

1056
01:08:51,890 --> 01:08:55,341
Scott: Yeah, if you place it if you crash the helmet helmets are one use.

1057
01:08:55,642 --> 01:08:58,290
Scott: if they get hit by something you have to replace it.

1058
01:08:58,350 --> 01:09:00,828
Scott: It won't protect your head a second time.

1059
01:09:01,211 --> 01:09:04,589
Rym: But the second the second question is did you drop it hard enough to crack it?

1060
01:09:05,149 --> 01:09:06,639
Scott: I've dropped it but not hard enough to crack.

1061
01:09:06,698 --> 01:09:07,462
Rym: Is it from the 70s?

1062
01:09:09,090 --> 01:09:09,432
Rym: Replace it.

1063
01:09:09,752 --> 01:09:10,395
Scott: No, it's not.

1064
01:09:10,475 --> 01:09:12,444
Rym: Is the outside just foam?

1065
01:09:12,907 --> 01:09:13,509
Rym: Replace it.

1066
01:09:14,292 --> 01:09:16,500
Rym: Does it not have a certification sticker in it?

1067
01:09:16,741 --> 01:09:17,323
Rym: Replace it.

1068
01:09:17,363 --> 01:09:19,390
Scott: It has the sticker and the outside is still plastic.

1069
01:09:19,450 --> 01:09:20,537
Scott: Does the plastic actually help?

1070
01:09:21,341 --> 01:09:21,663
Scott: I think so.

1071
01:09:21,684 --> 01:09:22,750
Scott: Or is it just decorative?

1072
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:24,080
Rym: So the plastic?

1073
01:09:24,424 --> 01:09:35,719
Rym: I think Because I from what I know the the PVC or whatever that like the actual part of the helmet the part of the helmet that matters the foam is destroyed by UV light Like it's weakened over time.

1074
01:09:35,738 --> 01:09:36,462
Rym: That's the main reason.

1075
01:09:36,502 --> 01:09:38,149
Scott: The plastic is protecting it.

1076
01:09:38,328 --> 01:09:40,818
Rym: Yep I don't think the plastic does anything else structurally.

1077
01:09:40,837 --> 01:09:42,443
Scott: I don't know.

1078
01:09:42,484 --> 01:09:43,988
Rym: Maybe it forms like an initial like.

1079
01:09:44,049 --> 01:09:44,350
Rym: I don't know.

1080
01:09:44,370 --> 01:09:45,374
