00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:12,462
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,642 --> 00:00:14,908
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:18,553
Rym: We're reviewing Dream Daddy, oh baby.

5
00:00:19,354 --> 00:00:20,315
Rym: I dated some dads.

6
00:00:20,735 --> 00:00:21,796
Scott: I dated them days.

7
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:25,060
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:26,922 --> 00:00:27,665
Scott: What do you see?

9
00:00:27,685 --> 00:00:30,054
Rym: I see a book that I haven't finished yet.

10
00:00:30,074 --> 00:00:37,172
Scott: I I'm still got to read a couple of appendices But I've seen all there is to see.

11
00:00:37,614 --> 00:00:39,420
Scott: I'm at a point where I've seen holy consult.

12
00:00:39,641 --> 00:00:40,403
Rym: I've seen some go.

13
00:00:40,483 --> 00:00:45,940
Scott: I know all the secrets of the golden room and it's golden secret ways.

14
00:00:46,322 --> 00:00:48,558
Scott: There is nothing in the golden room that I don't know.

15
00:00:49,362 --> 00:00:52,495
Scott: There's still plenty of things that no one knows except the author, but that's how books do.

16
00:00:52,756 --> 00:00:57,647
Rym: I got some suspicions But I gotta wait and see In case no one knows how we're talking about.

17
00:00:57,668 --> 00:01:01,160
Scott: there's a series of fantasy novels called the prince of nothing.

18
00:01:01,823 --> 00:01:11,179
Scott: We've been reading these things for as long as GeekNights has existed and the newest most epic revealing one came out an early July.

19
00:01:11,199 --> 00:01:13,384
Scott: I Finished it.

20
00:01:13,766 --> 00:01:14,992
Scott: Oh, no, it came out late July.

21
00:01:15,053 --> 00:01:16,078
Scott: I finished it in like a week.

22
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:17,604
Scott: It came out.

23
00:01:17,685 --> 00:01:20,174
Scott: It was delayed from July 5th to like July 25th.

24
00:01:20,214 --> 00:01:20,736
Scott: So I read it.

25
00:01:20,816 --> 00:01:21,780
Scott: I got the Kindle edition.

26
00:01:21,901 --> 00:01:24,483
Scott: I finished it again Two days ago.

27
00:01:24,503 --> 00:01:26,350
Rym: the only reason I'm not done with it already.

28
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:27,474
Rym: Is that my company?

29
00:01:27,534 --> 00:01:29,240
Rym: actually we moved offices to Midtown.

30
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,552
Rym: I'm in the fashion district now like 38th Avenue or 38th Street and 7th Avenue.

31
00:01:33,572 --> 00:01:35,137
Scott: I'm kind of I am at 49th and 7th.

32
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:39,720
Scott: Yeah, but I don't want to go to the shnippers that is between both of us.

33
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,332
Rym: I think we will at some point tomorrow not tomorrow.

34
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,839
Rym: I got shit to do still next day.

35
00:01:44,181 --> 00:01:47,360
Rym: Well someday soon, but so my commute's real short.

36
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,955
Rym: So I'm not reading as much and I was gonna just finish the book last night, but then I was playing dream daddy instead.

37
00:01:52,975 --> 00:01:57,335
Rym: Oh Someone brought the prince of nothing on the go thread into the new forum.

38
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:00,227
Scott: good What what do you see?

39
00:02:00,267 --> 00:02:01,211
Scott: What do you see?

40
00:02:01,452 --> 00:02:02,859
Rym: I see MOG for our.

41
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:05,826
Scott: I Definitely don't see God.

42
00:02:05,886 --> 00:02:06,630
Scott: I see no guy.

43
00:02:07,012 --> 00:02:14,153
Scott: a compass has brought a school About confess, he's not even and he's even mentioned in the newest book.

44
00:02:14,413 --> 00:02:15,477
Rym: I don't think he's mentioned once.

45
00:02:15,698 --> 00:02:16,140
Scott: that's wise.

46
00:02:16,421 --> 00:02:21,084
Scott: I mean, there's one thing I like about the series that this characters will be major characters in one book But they don't.

47
00:02:21,104 --> 00:02:22,599
Scott: they're not big enough to go to the next book.

48
00:02:23,242 --> 00:02:25,070
Scott: But at least my man's in him has got a mention.

49
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,480
Rym: I was in him as he got the rusty treatment right there.

50
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,565
Scott: So did his successor.

51
00:02:28,645 --> 00:02:35,932
Scott: the new marshal of a tramp has got a page or a couple paragraphs Yeah, like half a page who maybe also in route got mentions.

52
00:02:36,093 --> 00:02:38,420
Scott: in route got his name printed in the book more than once.

53
00:02:38,581 --> 00:02:45,593
Rym: Yeah, that's more than not just and not counting the glossary where his Again, not idly to the leaves of DeLorean fall and such.

54
00:02:45,955 --> 00:02:50,456
Scott: Yeah, so, you know It's not like the greatest fantasy series ever written.

55
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,180
Scott: It's not perfect.

56
00:02:51,723 --> 00:02:58,668
Scott: The author is known to be misogynist at times But we just love these books because they're so GeekNights.

57
00:02:58,969 --> 00:03:00,012
Scott: Yeah, what they're?

58
00:03:00,172 --> 00:03:00,413
Rym: they're?

59
00:03:00,553 --> 00:03:06,249
Rym: they're all about what you see and What it is to be human and such.

60
00:03:06,529 --> 00:03:07,592
Rym: Yeah, what is the soul?

61
00:03:07,993 --> 00:03:08,375
Rym: It's the stuff.

62
00:03:08,395 --> 00:03:11,184
Rym: basically these books are everything We argued about.

63
00:03:11,747 --> 00:03:22,707
Rym: sitting around after D&D games late at night in college Coupled with the kind of crap we did in D&D games in college coupled with UM play God's sci-fi Coupled with oh my god magic was ours.

64
00:03:22,787 --> 00:03:26,136
Scott: Yeah goons and coupled with oh my god history nerd.

65
00:03:26,177 --> 00:03:30,419
Scott: It's actually the Crusades Yeah, but also coupled with horrific coupling.

66
00:03:31,582 --> 00:03:33,029
Rym: Yeah, that's yeah, that's also in there.

67
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,799
Scott: I guess this fits the North Star type action.

68
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,556
Rym: Yeah, that's that fits with fist of the normally not appropriate for eight-year-olds.

69
00:03:38,897 --> 00:03:41,992
Scott: No It might not even be appropriate for 80 year olds.

70
00:03:42,173 --> 00:03:45,533
Rym: These books are not appropriate for anyone.

71
00:03:47,082 --> 00:03:48,169
Rym: Well, yeah that that they've been.

72
00:03:48,249 --> 00:03:51,878
Rym: that's why the book club the new one is delayed NFL not safe for life.

73
00:03:53,261 --> 00:03:54,124
Rym: So it's Tuesday.

74
00:03:54,164 --> 00:03:57,093
Rym: So we have some gaming news before a lot of little gaming news.

75
00:03:57,134 --> 00:03:59,120
Rym: Yeah, so we'll start with this eSports.

76
00:03:59,441 --> 00:04:03,600
Rym: I know we've been talking about right stuff a lot because it's really happening big time now.

77
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,708
Scott: It's like it's sort of like we're at the.

78
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,420
Scott: we're at like the forefront here.

79
00:04:06,561 --> 00:04:07,391
Scott: So we're gonna just keep.

80
00:04:07,634 --> 00:04:13,399
Scott: you know Gonna keep our boat our surfboard on the crest of that wave as long as we can right cuz ever we don't even know.

81
00:04:14,107 --> 00:04:24,880
Scott: Say on the crest of waves there might be some other part of the wave that they stay on but the point is they like this is I'd like at the Part where the guy is hanging 10 right and is surfing super awesomely the perfect part.

82
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,924
Scott: so I'm just so glad.

83
00:04:25,964 --> 00:04:33,828
Rym: for once we did our panel where we like said all these things that need to happen for eSports to get big and It's recorded and on YouTube with a date.

84
00:04:33,868 --> 00:04:35,935
Scott: We have a thousand thousand GeekNights.

85
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:37,220
Scott: episodes of the same thing happen.

86
00:04:37,521 --> 00:04:40,216
Rym: Oh, yeah, except what we don't have is we did that one panel.

87
00:04:40,236 --> 00:04:40,960
Rym: We only did it once.

88
00:04:41,061 --> 00:04:50,480
Rym: We didn't record it at like PAX Prime 2009 where we were like Nintendo should do this and Sega should do this and basically almost a look.

89
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,754
Rym: We were like, why doesn't someone remake x-com?

90
00:04:53,076 --> 00:04:53,780
Rym: That would be good.

91
00:04:54,542 --> 00:04:56,840
Rym: And that it almost all of it happened anyway.

92
00:04:57,441 --> 00:05:04,800
Scott: So we talked a while ago about how the owner of the Mets piece of shit owner will upon bought some eSports team.

93
00:05:05,124 --> 00:05:13,574
Scott: Yeah, right But here we go The Madison Square Garden company owned by an even bigger piece of shit owner if that was possible.

94
00:05:13,634 --> 00:05:16,060
Scott: Dolan has bought some gaming team.

95
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,716
Scott: I never heard of what the hell's their name computer counter logic gaming.

96
00:05:19,856 --> 00:05:20,700
Scott: I don't know who they are.

97
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,979
Rym: It's more teams have the worst name.

98
00:05:22,063 --> 00:05:22,902
Scott: Yeah but it's.

99
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:29,765
Scott: what's really awesome is like they put this video and it's like you got like the Knicks and the Rangers like Retweeting this video and it puts.

100
00:05:30,266 --> 00:05:34,899
Scott: it's like Madison Square Garden company Rangers Knicks Liberty, which is W NBA team.

101
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:48,331
Scott: Yeah, and then counter logic gaming up for logos all equally sized horizontally arranged three of these team on the same level as New York Knicks of players who get paid millions of dollars every year.

102
00:05:48,732 --> 00:05:53,659
Rym: However, three of these logos look appropriate and One of them just does not look like it.

103
00:05:54,081 --> 00:06:04,569
Scott: I think they need some new branding because like I have a hard time caring about them with their branding I also think that they play MOBAs, which I don't care about But but they're not be under their logo.

104
00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:15,660
Scott: cuz even playing even playing MOBAs, right if they are playing those MOBAs in Madison Square Garden and They change their branding to make me care about them because they're more they would be more New York.

105
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,459
Rym: It was something New York II like the New York subway.

106
00:06:18,022 --> 00:06:22,600
Scott: They were the least bit New York II even playing League of Legends, which I never played in my life.

107
00:06:22,801 --> 00:06:23,563
Scott: I played dota though.

108
00:06:23,864 --> 00:06:31,896
Scott: Yeah, if they played that in Madison Square Garden and the season tickets are cheap enough I would still go yeah and cheer for them if they just change everything in brand.

109
00:06:31,936 --> 00:06:34,327
Scott: cuz I don't care about Counter logic gaming.

110
00:06:34,367 --> 00:06:37,380
Rym: I mean I went and saw the Knicks a few times and I really don't like basketball.

111
00:06:37,562 --> 00:06:43,252
Rym: I really don't like basketball But I had a pretty good time Being at those Knicks games partly because I could sit like right on the court.

112
00:06:43,312 --> 00:06:44,476
Rym: cuz no one goes to Knicks games.

113
00:06:44,677 --> 00:06:46,344
Scott: going to sports Is really we.

114
00:06:46,424 --> 00:06:50,080
Scott: I mean we went to RIT hockey before we cared about them and then we cared about them.

115
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,465
Scott: That's how that's how it works.

116
00:06:51,867 --> 00:06:53,534
Scott: you go and then you care more.

117
00:06:53,654 --> 00:06:55,080
Scott: It's a chicken and egg situation.

118
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,522
Scott: You don't go.

119
00:06:55,925 --> 00:06:58,740
Scott: Oh when I care about that, I would go if I cared more.

120
00:06:58,841 --> 00:07:04,279
Scott: It's like you're never gonna care though But if you go to one then suddenly you're gonna start caring and that's how you get hooked.

121
00:07:04,605 --> 00:07:09,607
Scott: It's tricky though Like if I got a candy and you never ate candy in your life You're gonna be like I don't need to eat.

122
00:07:09,647 --> 00:07:11,620
Scott: that is bad for you and then you eat one candy.

123
00:07:12,463 --> 00:07:16,530
Scott: I guess the problem is I Like I can tell a candy when I seen it.

124
00:07:16,571 --> 00:07:18,280
Scott: I got experience of living a long time.

125
00:07:18,381 --> 00:07:23,729
Rym: I know I'm glad that we went to that game of footy But I don't think I'd go to more games of footy.

126
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,897
Scott: would I go to more games of footy.

127
00:07:26,398 --> 00:07:27,141
Scott: That's a good I think.

128
00:07:27,162 --> 00:07:32,848
Scott: if I lived in Australia, I don't think I would go to season tickets of footy But I would go I would.

129
00:07:32,948 --> 00:07:35,320
Scott: it would be more like baseball where I go to like one footy a year

130
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:39,600
Rym: like if we go to PAX Australia this year and there's a footy game and I happen to be in Melbourne and

131
00:07:40,445 --> 00:07:46,614
Scott: And if I lived in Australia and like it was a thing I would probably be watching like, you know, the championship and the playoffs like on TV.

132
00:07:47,036 --> 00:07:47,297
Rym: I wouldn't.

133
00:07:47,377 --> 00:07:48,080
Rym: I've watched cricket.

134
00:07:48,161 --> 00:07:49,539
Rym: I would never watch cricket again.

135
00:07:49,721 --> 00:07:50,966
Rym: I can't could not care.

136
00:07:50,986 --> 00:07:54,380
Scott: cricket is weird because I love everything about it.

137
00:07:55,122 --> 00:07:59,217
Scott: The professional cricket right they do the the test matches that last for fucking ever.

138
00:07:59,418 --> 00:08:02,275
Scott: Yep, right But I actually would go.

139
00:08:02,295 --> 00:08:03,000
Scott: I can go to Queens.

140
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:08,660
Scott: I can just bike out there to where like the amateur just people are playing for fun on the weekend and that's actually way fun.

141
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,283
Scott: It's because they're so into it especially if you.

142
00:08:11,303 --> 00:08:21,919
Scott: just what you got to do is you can't just watch because the way cricket works is you send out two batters and The rest of the team is just like Except for the defense team is on is all over the place, right?

143
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:38,400
Scott: You just hang out with the batting team Which is only only has two people out there and they're chillin and eatin and talking and they're so happy that you care about their game And are actually paying attention to them and they're ready to talk your ear off about how great cricket is and explain what's going on.

144
00:08:38,501 --> 00:08:39,818
Scott: Yeah, that's a good time.

145
00:08:40,462 --> 00:08:41,486
Rym: Actually, I'm gonna watch cricket.

146
00:08:41,508 --> 00:08:48,380
Scott: I almost would rather watch the Trobriand Islanders playing great But the way they play cricket in out at the park is they don't play the infinite test match.

147
00:08:48,501 --> 00:08:52,240
Scott: They play a set number of you know runs or whatever or whatever it's called.

148
00:08:52,742 --> 00:08:55,553
Scott: So it's like there's a limited time to how long the thing is gonna get.

149
00:08:55,593 --> 00:09:03,866
Rym: and also like I know Emily be mad at me But I can't watch soccer and I just don't want to go to a soccer My hooligans and to.

150
00:09:04,087 --> 00:09:05,712
Rym: that is so boring.

151
00:09:05,892 --> 00:09:11,913
Scott: if soccer would a shrink the field and Be become more objective then I would I would like it.

152
00:09:11,953 --> 00:09:17,830
Scott: I would be like summer hockey, basically Only on grass, but those two things they did not fix.

153
00:09:18,031 --> 00:09:24,344
Scott: Yeah, so it is boring as hell, but I can't When there's an incredible soccer thing on you Internet.

154
00:09:24,365 --> 00:09:33,620
Rym: the gist of this news is that if you're not paying attention Esports all the real money people are coming into the eSports industry like right now.

155
00:09:34,101 --> 00:09:39,100
Rym: This is the like behind the scenes build-up because if public it's not even behind the scenes.

156
00:09:39,181 --> 00:09:40,699
Scott: This is in front of the scenes.

157
00:09:41,602 --> 00:09:42,465
Scott: Part already happened.

158
00:09:42,546 --> 00:09:45,860
Rym: So this is that there's some of this is appearing in front of the scenes.

159
00:09:46,563 --> 00:09:50,820
Rym: Usually when that happens, it's because there is a ton more going on behind the scenes.

160
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,369
Scott: Oh, there's a huge avalanche.

161
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:54,100
Rym: This is just what's bubbling out of the top.

162
00:09:54,287 --> 00:09:56,406
Rym: Oh, yeah I mean Wall Street dudes.

163
00:09:56,546 --> 00:09:58,072
Rym: I've stood because they know that I do this stuff.

164
00:09:58,112 --> 00:10:05,240
Rym: because like LinkedIn profile and like something fine GeekNights When I'm in like London or Singapore, whatever people ask me like so, how do I invest in eSports?

165
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,973
Scott: They know you can't invent sports traditionally have been hard to invest in.

166
00:10:08,993 --> 00:10:16,286
Rym: you have to buy a team and eSports You have to buy a team in most cases, but you could like invest in blizzard Like I actually buy like NFL stock.

167
00:10:16,587 --> 00:10:22,026
Scott: Otherwise, I totally wouldn't something actually maybe not but technically have stock You can buy for like a fan.

168
00:10:22,067 --> 00:10:23,152
Rym: Like I own one share.

169
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,600
Scott: That's the Green Bay Packers.

170
00:10:24,821 --> 00:10:28,533
Scott: That's the only one the only one but I bought only.

171
00:10:28,553 --> 00:10:30,620
Scott: that's the actually the team with the best ownership on earth.

172
00:10:30,782 --> 00:10:32,020
Rym: This is not investment advice.

173
00:10:32,141 --> 00:10:37,756
Rym: I'm not an investment advisor nor my lawyer But I bought a bunch of Blizzard stock a while ago and I can be an Activision stuff.

174
00:10:37,876 --> 00:10:40,611
Rym: Activision Blizzard ATVI I think is the ticker.

175
00:10:40,651 --> 00:10:47,969
Scott: Yes, because I But activisions non blizzard stuff is really falling though I know and their blizzard stuff is really taking up.

176
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:55,055
Rym: exactly if they if they I'm hoping that someday They will cleave all that like all the cruft from that company.

177
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:58,699
Scott: and just hey boss Why would they buy Blizzard that to then have?

178
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,223
Scott: Their main part?

179
00:11:00,363 --> 00:11:04,980
Scott: I'll be like if we bought some other podcast and then that podcaster plays the ignites and GeekNights went away.

180
00:11:05,787 --> 00:11:15,020
Scott: Yeah That happens more often than you'd think in corporate M&A Like that is you buy a thing and then that thing is better than the thing that bought it.

181
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:15,663
Scott: It's you.

182
00:11:15,703 --> 00:11:17,895
Rym: it's like you try to eat this little guy and then he turns around.

183
00:11:17,936 --> 00:11:18,720
Rym: just eat you right back.

184
00:11:18,821 --> 00:11:19,334
Rym: And what do you do?

185
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,696
Rym: Usually that'll happen if the other you still own it technically.

186
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:23,340
Scott: see what do you care?

187
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,302
Scott: But it's still weird.

188
00:11:24,343 --> 00:11:29,720
Rym: I feel like it usually happens when the buying party is a big old company with tons of money.

189
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:35,315
Rym: That's shitty and not doing well and it buys a smaller better run company.

190
00:11:35,596 --> 00:11:44,143
Rym: and the smaller better run company It does better than it because it's actually a dying giant but it now has been money invested into it so we can do things Like it hasn't?

191
00:11:44,163 --> 00:11:54,658
Rym: it has old money and it buys a young money team and the young money team They're young money thing then turns into the real money and the old money thing just dies Like it's this cancerous corpse of a company.

192
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:57,948
Scott: Activision is I mean blizzard is from the early 90s.

193
00:11:58,068 --> 00:12:02,380
Scott: Activision is from is only maybe 10 years older because Activision had Atari games.

194
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,589
Scott: Yeah, like pitfall Activision was like blizzard.

195
00:12:04,669 --> 00:12:07,080
Scott: blizzard started blizzard started with PC games.

196
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:11,035
Rym: I want to say like Activision is just this really long and they're both pretty.

197
00:12:11,055 --> 00:12:12,420
Scott: they're both downward spiral.

198
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,905
Scott: They're both pretty old is the point.

199
00:12:13,985 --> 00:12:16,353
Rym: Yeah, but I got faith in them.

200
00:12:16,614 --> 00:12:17,999
Rym: So pay attention to this stuff.

201
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:19,661
Rym: and There's.

202
00:12:20,304 --> 00:12:22,835
Rym: there are career opportunities in this space as well.

203
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:23,820
Scott: That's what I'm looking for.

204
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,072
Scott: Think about how many people work like a Rangers hockey game.

205
00:12:27,474 --> 00:12:28,920
Rym: How many people work for that team?

206
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,544
Scott: Well aren't players?

207
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:35,140
Scott: a lot a lot of those people work for the Mass Square Garden company, and they won't need new hires.

208
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,600
Scott: They're not gonna need new ticket salespeople or new ushers.

209
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,122
Scott: Yeah, right.

210
00:12:39,142 --> 00:12:51,140
Rym: They're not gonna tell me sports leagues and teams will need all that stuff, but they are gonna need I know other things equipment managers coaches Trainers like there's going to be an industry here.

211
00:12:51,200 --> 00:13:01,420
Rym: They're going to be people who go to school graduate with a degree in like sports medicine and are literally the trainer like Massaging the players hands and like keeping an eye on their tendonitis.

212
00:13:01,522 --> 00:13:02,518
Scott: It's not the job for me.

213
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:13,694
Scott: but if you look at like the job postings of your local sport company like on their websites like in our case Madison Square Garden corporation or Sterling Mets whatever.

214
00:13:13,714 --> 00:13:22,003
Scott: Yeah, all right just look at the job postings on those company sites and look for ones that mention the eSport part and there might be a Future for you.

215
00:13:22,024 --> 00:13:26,000
Scott: It is not does not involve some boring ass corporate desk.

216
00:13:26,209 --> 00:13:27,865
Rym: Yeah Like think someone has to like.

217
00:13:28,327 --> 00:13:30,134
Rym: set up the PCs for the tournament.

218
00:13:30,154 --> 00:13:35,480
Scott: and even if you start with a low ass You know, that's a low paying part-time job like guy who sets up the PCs.

219
00:13:35,661 --> 00:13:36,264
Scott: But you know what?

220
00:13:36,746 --> 00:13:39,480
Scott: That's an entry position and you're getting in at the very beginning.

221
00:13:39,741 --> 00:13:42,291
Scott: Yeah, stick with it for a long as time.

222
00:13:42,311 --> 00:13:45,573
Scott: look at like really like 10 years from now You'll be running to shit.

223
00:13:45,775 --> 00:13:46,200
Rym: look at what?

224
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,200
Scott: Manager like the general manager of a team which is like a job that pays millions of dollars a year.

225
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,184
Rym: It's like in the military.

226
00:13:53,204 --> 00:13:57,500
Rym: It's the non-commissioned officer track like trades with this is you could be trading players.

227
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,358
Scott: Let me talking about you on sports radio.

228
00:13:59,761 --> 00:14:04,740
Rym: But look what a team like that jet like the equipment manager retires and they'll always be like come on out on the eyes.

229
00:14:04,921 --> 00:14:07,477
Rym: You've been our equipment manager for 30 years.

230
00:14:07,537 --> 00:14:07,859
Scott: You're here.

231
00:14:09,523 --> 00:14:11,174
Rym: You could be that person.

232
00:14:11,355 --> 00:14:15,180
Scott: Yep So in some other news, let's do these news is quick.

233
00:14:15,369 --> 00:14:16,567
Scott: Yeah So that was the big news.

234
00:14:16,627 --> 00:14:18,540
Rym: there is a new hearthstone car.

235
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:27,740
Scott: Well, the hearthstone expansions coming real soon and that what they do is they always give Individual cards to different like media outlets including streamers websites, etc.

236
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:29,611
Scott: And they all reveal one card each.

237
00:14:29,832 --> 00:14:31,120
Scott: because there's plenty of cars to go around.

238
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,379
Scott: There's like hundreds of them in different countries - they at least dole them out.

239
00:14:34,801 --> 00:14:43,187
Scott: So the one I forget who revealed this one, but it's a Kotaku revealed as far as I'm concerned Kotaku anyway, it's an insane card.

240
00:14:43,207 --> 00:14:49,558
Scott: you play it and it takes a copy of your opponent's deck and Shuffles it into your deck.

241
00:14:50,542 --> 00:14:53,310
Scott: They've had things like this before but this is they've like.

242
00:14:53,411 --> 00:15:05,160
Rym: this is a new frontier in the pre digital era like even if you came up with like cleverness in a collectible or Non-collectible card game was limited by the physical reality of the card.

243
00:15:05,341 --> 00:15:14,040
Scott: I can't just Oh take a copy of some dudes magic deck, you know Go into a box get a full set of cards exact and then see what's in his deck with my eye or even stuff like.

244
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:14,643
Scott: Think about that.

245
00:15:14,743 --> 00:15:21,776
Scott: you get a copy of your opponent's deck you shuffle it into yours But you don't even know what's in there and you start drawing cards.

246
00:15:21,816 --> 00:15:26,092
Scott: and now when you draw a card You know that that was in his deck at the time that you copied it.

247
00:15:26,353 --> 00:15:28,400
Scott: Oh, it's just so much going on there.

248
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,264
Rym: so the fat.

249
00:15:29,284 --> 00:15:32,118
Scott: when Blizzard went digital feeling at the information and the.

250
00:15:33,022 --> 00:15:34,206
Scott: Yeah, it's okay.

251
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:35,390
Scott: They basically.

252
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:38,400
Scott: this is why I keep playing this game, even though it's a random bullshit money game.

253
00:15:38,481 --> 00:15:42,185
Rym: There's an ocean of amazing crazy things.

254
00:15:42,226 --> 00:15:47,380
Rym: they can do with the fact that it's digital while still maintaining the the simplicity of the card can see.

255
00:15:48,224 --> 00:15:57,900
Rym: But although up to this point, they've basically dipped their toes into that ocean They've been like poke and poke In the more and this in the in the expansion that just came out recently.

256
00:15:58,261 --> 00:16:03,240
Scott: They've done a few things like yeah cards that give plus ones and stuff to cards that are in your hand.

257
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,390
Scott: That would be impossible with physical cards, right?

258
00:16:05,611 --> 00:16:07,640
Scott: Yeah, and they've also done a lot of that's waiting.

259
00:16:07,881 --> 00:16:09,285
Rym: They still waited in a little bit.

260
00:16:09,325 --> 00:16:10,328
Scott: They've done a lot of stuff.

261
00:16:10,388 --> 00:16:19,740
Scott: Like oh if your deck contains no duplicates or Like all these things that you couldn't possibly or very very difficultly do with physical cards.

262
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,603
Scott: But this is just.

263
00:16:20,824 --> 00:16:24,617
Rym: this is a guy in a catapult catapulted into the middle of the ocean.

264
00:16:24,677 --> 00:16:25,620
Scott: This is ridonkulous.

265
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,584
Scott: I don't think it's like.

266
00:16:26,604 --> 00:16:28,009
Scott: can you really go further than this?

267
00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:29,073
Scott: How could you top this?

268
00:16:29,876 --> 00:16:31,100
Rym: I think this is just the beginning.

269
00:16:31,442 --> 00:16:41,335
Rym: I think there's gonna be a. I think there'll be an era of craziness at some point Mmm, so in some other news tiny tiny news, but GameStop is obviously a worthless company.

270
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:46,080
Rym: It exists basically solely to Prey on kids too young to have credit cards.

271
00:16:47,461 --> 00:16:49,728
Scott: People who refuse to use Amazon.

272
00:16:49,748 --> 00:16:55,615
Scott: Yeah, like GameStop sir, even even buying video games Even Best Buy is better than games.

273
00:16:55,655 --> 00:17:03,259
Rym: Yeah Maybe Walmart's cheaper than GameStop and Walmart maybe sell you a pre-order and then not have.

274
00:17:03,299 --> 00:17:06,359
Scott: I mean There's the worst places in GameStop, but listen.

275
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,040
Rym: Well, yeah, like by the worst place in GameStop is the guy in the alley behind game, right?

276
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,200
Scott: But we are not paid by Amazon in any way.

277
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:23,980
Scott: we honestly just use Amazon for everything because what Amazon does as a business is They screw over people who sell stuff in order to profit for themselves and to benefit customers.

278
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:27,954
Scott: And since we are all customers, you know using Amazon is to our advantage.

279
00:17:27,994 --> 00:17:29,160
Scott: It's very important cheap.

280
00:17:29,843 --> 00:17:30,145
Scott: I don't.

281
00:17:30,325 --> 00:17:33,200
Rym: I would not care if things like Amazon were more expensive.

282
00:17:33,341 --> 00:17:35,450
Rym: I'd still use them because I just don't want to go shopping.

283
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:37,238
Scott: The point is GameStop sucks.

284
00:17:37,258 --> 00:17:37,680
Scott: Don't go there.

285
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:45,340
Rym: Yeah, so GameStop doubled down on being terrible and they announced I don't know if they've personally done this before but they announced this early.

286
00:17:46,502 --> 00:17:49,955
Rym: It's August and they already announced that for Thanksgiving.

287
00:17:50,276 --> 00:17:51,219
Rym: They're staying open.

288
00:17:51,761 --> 00:17:54,370
Scott: So all kinds of places are staying open in Thanksgiving.

289
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:54,912
Scott: That's not new.

290
00:17:54,952 --> 00:18:06,379
Scott: I'm surprised they weren't open on Thanksgiving previously On Thanksgiving game because I feel like their customer base is almost exclusively 13-year-olds don't have credit cards, you know what the you know what the problem is.

291
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,931
Scott: Here's why they got to be open on Thanksgiving because you know who's open on Thanksgiving.

292
00:18:10,332 --> 00:18:21,020
Scott: Walmart steam-powered.com is open Thanksgiving with a big ol fucking sale every goddamn year and GameStop is sitting there closed at that same exact moment.

293
00:18:21,104 --> 00:18:23,050
Scott: Yeah This is why GameStop.

294
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:26,748
Rym: that is true because the other Demographic at GameStop other than 13 year olds.

295
00:18:26,788 --> 00:18:29,659
Scott: Are you gonna not buy games on Steam because they're open on Thanksgiving?

296
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:39,594
Rym: are The PR grandma who wants to buy a video game present For Christmas and she buys it on the way to the Thanksgiving dinner at the Super Sale.

297
00:18:39,614 --> 00:18:47,350
Scott: Mm-hmm, and she doesn't realize that Your grandma can buy you a steam gift card with her phone.

298
00:18:47,971 --> 00:18:48,734
Scott: you have the best grandma.

299
00:18:48,974 --> 00:18:49,255
Rym: Yeah.

300
00:18:49,436 --> 00:18:58,379
Rym: Yeah, so I weirdly Deeply enjoy watching large conventions fail which puts extra pressure when we start our convention to not fuck it up.

301
00:18:58,962 --> 00:19:02,020
Scott: But gonna be so small we can't fuck it up if we mess it up like there.

302
00:19:02,582 --> 00:19:07,800
Rym: I have dug this grave for myself, but it happened yet again, and there's a moral here.

303
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:14,566
Rym: Apparently there's a gamer cruise that was gonna be like like a PAX cruise or a joko cruise But it's gonna be like gaming.

304
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:15,430
Scott: who ran it?

305
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:16,796
Rym: the video gamer gauntlet.

306
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:17,720
Scott: I never heard of them.

307
00:19:18,069 --> 00:19:21,450
Scott: So basically, where was the cruise going to and from who even cares?

308
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:26,428
Scott: because the none of that's interesting could have been a cold cruise versus a Nice, you know Royal Caribbean.

309
00:19:26,448 --> 00:19:27,613
Rym: It was gonna be a big cruise ship.

310
00:19:27,794 --> 00:19:30,640
Scott: Well that they're only getting a part of it though Yeah, they're not the whole boat.

311
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:34,320
Rym: But the story is they got a bunch of sponsors to make this happen.

312
00:19:34,823 --> 00:19:39,451
Rym: Some of the sponsors pulled out because they're not well organized I guess yeah, and because some of the sponsors pulled out.

313
00:19:39,692 --> 00:19:43,185
Rym: the cruise line was like yo, you don't have enough credit So you need more sponsors.

314
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:44,068
Rym: I got a pony up money.

315
00:19:44,088 --> 00:19:44,770
Rym: Mm-hmm.

316
00:19:48,001 --> 00:19:50,210
Rym: Other sponsors were like, whoa, whoa.

317
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,576
Scott: Why do those sponsors pull out?

318
00:19:51,616 --> 00:19:52,399
Scott: Why would I pull in?

319
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,820
Scott: Yep So the moral here is this is a good deal.

320
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,403
Scott: Why did those be?

321
00:19:57,423 --> 00:20:03,839
Rym: the reason I bring this news up is because there's a pattern here with all these Big nerd events that are starting to pop up and fail.

322
00:20:04,502 --> 00:20:18,192
Rym: The problem is a lot of companies or people who have some money or some investment ties go to a nerd convention like packs or S DCC or something and they see it and they go.

323
00:20:18,212 --> 00:20:20,460
Scott: some assholes go to a convention and they see it.

324
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:20,922
Scott: They go.

325
00:20:20,982 --> 00:20:24,135
Scott: I could do this I could do this, but then I know like that.

326
00:20:24,315 --> 00:20:25,380
Rym: Oh, yeah, but here's the difference.

327
00:20:25,781 --> 00:20:26,503
Rym: Here's the difference.

328
00:20:26,905 --> 00:20:28,590
Rym: They try to start that big.

329
00:20:30,161 --> 00:20:32,194
Scott: They start cruises are not big.

330
00:20:32,536 --> 00:20:36,329
Scott: Yeah, but this Anyone can organize one of these crews already.

331
00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:39,600
Scott: So this one start crews events are actually some of the easiest to organize.

332
00:20:40,021 --> 00:20:40,584
Rym: It depends.

333
00:20:41,045 --> 00:20:42,350
Rym: so there's a lot of ways.

334
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:47,808
Rym: there's like four or five different structures to those kinds of events But they started at the level of.

335
00:20:47,828 --> 00:20:51,800
Rym: you need multiple big-money sponsors for the event to even occur.

336
00:20:52,343 --> 00:20:54,757
Rym: That's already too big for a first convention.

337
00:20:54,818 --> 00:20:57,708
Rym: Yep You're we're starting on the level of.

338
00:20:58,069 --> 00:21:01,280
Rym: we're personally funding the entire first event.

339
00:21:02,501 --> 00:21:03,945
Rym: That is the level you start at.

340
00:21:03,985 --> 00:21:07,795
Rym: we're shooting for like a hundred people a one room.

341
00:21:07,996 --> 00:21:11,848
Scott: Yeah one room maybe Two rooms ready to room.

342
00:21:11,908 --> 00:21:13,072
Scott: daddy to room is.

343
00:21:13,092 --> 00:21:13,754
Scott: the second room.

344
00:21:13,794 --> 00:21:14,035
Scott: is the?

345
00:21:14,115 --> 00:21:15,440
Scott: is the storage room for our stuff?

346
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,274
Rym: Yeah, and maybe the panel room for coat check is before.

347
00:21:18,314 --> 00:21:19,520
Scott: second room is the coat check?

348
00:21:19,881 --> 00:21:22,952
Rym: Yeah, if we have a panel track, there will be one track.

349
00:21:23,293 --> 00:21:24,116
Rym: Here are the panels.

350
00:21:24,156 --> 00:21:26,044
Rym: There's six of them Like that's.

351
00:21:26,225 --> 00:21:28,033
Scott: that's there in the same room as the other stuff.

352
00:21:28,173 --> 00:21:35,436
Rym: Yeah on a stage So there's a game called pub G. You might have seen player unknown battlegrounds.

353
00:21:35,456 --> 00:21:36,540
Rym: I really want to play it.

354
00:21:37,481 --> 00:21:40,853
Scott: I'm thinking about playing it, but it's too much money and it's whatever.

355
00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:44,386
Scott: but it's basically it's battle royale But the rules are slightly different.

356
00:21:44,407 --> 00:21:44,728
Scott: basically.

357
00:21:44,748 --> 00:21:55,506
Rym: instead in battle royale if you ever seen the movie, which you should Yeah, and do not read the comic it is vile Maybe and I say that having read a bunch of the last book of The Prince of Nothing Maybe you should be.

358
00:21:55,526 --> 00:21:56,373
Scott: I haven't read the book.

359
00:21:56,434 --> 00:22:07,500
Scott: the original Battle royale was actually a book the battle royale might I haven't read it might be good Battle royale manga is vile to the point that I stopped reading it after two volume.

360
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:08,659
Scott: But anyway, the movie is good.

361
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:16,916
Scott: So in the movie the way it works is you're there on the island and there's all these rules with the neck things and whatever It's like you have you can't be in certain zones at certain times.

362
00:22:16,956 --> 00:22:19,547
Scott: the way pub G What are games is there's a big circle.

363
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:22,880
Scott: they get smaller and smaller and smaller aiming at a certain point.

364
00:22:23,181 --> 00:22:30,649
Scott: so basically even though the game is long you're forced to get closer and closer to everyone over time and Eventually, there's one person left at the end who wins right.

365
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:33,960
Rym: so and now most people who I trust talk about this game.

366
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,352
Rym: They always say oh, it's bad.

367
00:22:35,433 --> 00:22:36,260
Rym: Here's all the problems.

368
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:38,140
Scott: But then they also I hear good things.

369
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,739
Rym: But then they also say that they have a lot of fun playing it and they just keep playing it.

370
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:44,434
Scott: Yeah, but I mean it's too much money right now for me to play.

371
00:22:44,454 --> 00:22:45,500
Scott: when I've got all these other games.

372
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,040
Rym: I could buy it for you with the patreon money, but then we'd have to do shows.

373
00:22:48,181 --> 00:22:50,820
Scott: How much am I gonna play it though using waste that throw that money away?

374
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:53,479
Rym: Well, what we'd have to do is like live stream it a bunch and then like do it.

375
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,360
Scott: I'm not gonna play it enough to be worth paying.

376
00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:08,273
Scott: But anyway, there's a controversy now because the game is early access and they're starting to sell some loot crates with you know cosmetic loot in them for 250 right whatever I don't care about as long as they're only selling cosmetic stuff.

377
00:23:08,293 --> 00:23:10,281
Scott: that never bothers me because I just don't buy it Right.

378
00:23:10,362 --> 00:23:13,980
Scott: I only take free stuff or and but if it's paid away, it's not pay to win, right?

379
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,206
Scott: Everyone's still on equal footing.

380
00:23:15,649 --> 00:23:16,534
Scott: So it's fine by me.

381
00:23:16,554 --> 00:23:17,117
Scott: I don't give a shit.

382
00:23:17,157 --> 00:23:19,380
Scott: if I played it I would just never buy a single loot crate ever.

383
00:23:20,261 --> 00:23:25,360
Scott: But people are real upset because they promised maybe that they wouldn't sell loot crates till they were officially released.

384
00:23:25,767 --> 00:23:26,459
Scott: But they're not yet.

385
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,283
Scott: So there's something loot.

386
00:23:27,343 --> 00:23:28,948
Scott: and there was another game that did this.

387
00:23:29,028 --> 00:23:32,700
Scott: was that our survival evolved that was sold a whole DLC before it.

388
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,845
Scott: Well, it's still early access.

389
00:23:33,925 --> 00:23:36,376
Scott: Yo, and here's the thing people and this.

390
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:44,820
Scott: I've said this long line This this beta early access stuff is just like this completely arbitrary distinction.

391
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:53,000
Scott: Right games don't get released and be done anymore If the game is either ready for the public to play it or not, right?

392
00:23:53,442 --> 00:23:57,400
Scott: It's like you might put some label on it to say oh it still has bugs.

393
00:23:57,601 --> 00:23:58,725
Scott: Oh, we're still working on it.

394
00:23:58,765 --> 00:24:01,898
Scott: But if people are playing it and having fun, it's fucking released.

395
00:24:01,918 --> 00:24:02,340
Rym: It's like dark.

396
00:24:02,601 --> 00:24:06,553
Rym: That's one of the problems with a video ball, which should have been great.

397
00:24:06,633 --> 00:24:09,000
Rym: Is that I think they spent they waited too long?

398
00:24:09,503 --> 00:24:12,320
Scott: Well, I think the thing is it's it's fine to wait too long.

399
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,927
Scott: That's what half-life 1 did.

400
00:24:14,008 --> 00:24:16,680
Scott: right is like we're gonna just work on this forever until it's perfect.

401
00:24:17,021 --> 00:24:18,325
Scott: And then they released it all at once.

402
00:24:18,827 --> 00:24:22,980
Scott: right, you know, but you basically didn't see much of it until it was released.

403
00:24:23,842 --> 00:24:31,222
Scott: Right, but I mean I completely ignore whether a game pretty much like the only thing I look at when a game is early access Is.

404
00:24:31,643 --> 00:24:42,420
Scott: I'm nicely seeing how done the game is right because sometimes because it's okay to release a game That's not a hundred percent done as long as it's playable, but some people are putting games out that are like there's nothing there.

405
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:47,059
Scott: It's literally like you can jump and it's a platform or you can jump and there's no bad guys or nothing.

406
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:48,290
Scott: yet And they're like early access.

407
00:24:48,391 --> 00:24:49,118
Scott: It's like what?

408
00:24:49,782 --> 00:24:53,799
Scott: But I mean these games are at a point to where like the game is there.

409
00:24:54,741 --> 00:24:56,653
Scott: Tons and tons of people are playing this thing.

410
00:24:57,136 --> 00:24:57,660
Scott: It's a game.

411
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,584
Scott: It's a real game.

412
00:24:58,885 --> 00:25:02,740
Scott: who cares if they call it early access because they're still doing stuff, right?

413
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:06,072
Scott: They just put on an update that added like vehicle horns.

414
00:25:06,153 --> 00:25:08,160
Scott: It's like such a minor changes going on.

415
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,816
Scott: Now you're telling me this game is not released.

416
00:25:10,521 --> 00:25:14,153
Scott: Seriously, it's like we got to start ignoring these labels.

417
00:25:14,333 --> 00:25:15,156
Scott: right at the same time.

418
00:25:15,196 --> 00:25:18,440
Rym: the players who are mad about this Just don't buy the cosmetic nonsense.

419
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,712
Scott: Don't be a person who cares about cosmetic nonsense and never buy.

420
00:25:23,792 --> 00:25:28,870
Scott: if no one bought any cosmetic nonsense game Developers wouldn't be selling it because they would.

421
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:30,456
Scott: no one would buy it because they'd go.

422
00:25:30,536 --> 00:25:31,460
Scott: Oh, why would I pay for that?

423
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,548
Scott: That's literally nothing.

424
00:25:32,588 --> 00:25:33,919
Scott: Why am I giving you money for bits?

425
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:39,140
Rym: That's stupid as people still whenever I play overwatch and I live stream it people increasingly get mad at me.

426
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,032
Rym: I have a hundred and seven unopened loot crates.

427
00:25:41,092 --> 00:25:45,769
Scott: You should just go for a thousand And that you should never open those loot crates.

428
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:49,810
Rym: I'm getting faster now because I'm actually playing the arcade mode So I get like a bunch of extra ones.

429
00:25:50,334 --> 00:25:51,220
Rym: Oh the arcade mode.

430
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,227
Rym: They have a really good mode now like our like it's.

431
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:54,612
Rym: it is so great.

432
00:25:54,692 --> 00:25:57,040
Rym: It's 6v6 and it's just deathmatch.

433
00:25:57,582 --> 00:26:00,932
Rym: You don't respawn and you play its best of like whoever wins.

434
00:26:00,952 --> 00:26:03,360
Scott: so counter-strike without bombs whoever wins three.

435
00:26:03,801 --> 00:26:11,668
Rym: But the rule is if you win around any characters that anyone on your team picked for that round You cannot use for the rest of the game.

436
00:26:12,149 --> 00:26:17,827
Scott: So if if we win round one and I chose That gamer girl with the robot.

437
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:22,145
Rym: Yeah, then no one can be the gamer girl the robot for the rest of nobody No one on your team.

438
00:26:22,567 --> 00:26:23,411
Scott: No one on the whole team.

439
00:26:23,492 --> 00:26:24,215
Scott: Not just me.

440
00:26:24,276 --> 00:26:25,160
Scott: Yeah, what I'm a whole team.

441
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,000
Scott: So there's only you run out of characters.

442
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:36,500
Rym: yeah, so usually you'll see like one team wins two in a row and then they're kind of bad at the remaining characters and then They get steamrolled like stuff like that.

443
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:43,705
Rym: Other team is gonna have to choose shitty characters in their round three or a team might mess up and pick two healers twice and I think I know healers for the last round.

444
00:26:43,745 --> 00:26:45,270
Rym: Like you can really mess yourself up.

445
00:26:45,932 --> 00:26:48,480
Rym: It's way fun like way fun.

446
00:26:48,761 --> 00:26:51,378
Rym: And the rose good mode, they're really short too good.

447
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:55,694
Rym: So I can like play three rounds of it in like ten minutes and then just be done.

448
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:57,480
Scott: I afraid I appreciate this mode.

449
00:26:57,681 --> 00:26:58,565
Scott: Yeah, it's a good mode.

450
00:26:59,268 --> 00:27:02,604
Rym: and last and this could almost be a whole episode But we'll see where that.

451
00:27:02,644 --> 00:27:06,981
Scott: basically it's similar to the previous news, which is why I wanted to bring it up Bad.

452
00:27:07,001 --> 00:27:11,080
Scott: so you're bad in in the Zelda game for the switch, right?

453
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:22,000
Scott: They had this thing where if you got amiibos You could hook them up and you would get like treasure chest falling out of the sky with stuff in them and some of the Stuff was exclusive stuff, but it was cosmetic stuff like Nintendo switch t-shirt.

454
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:24,740
Scott: It's like who cares if you can wear a Nintendo switch t-shirt.

455
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,143
Scott: I don't like.

456
00:27:25,164 --> 00:27:33,680
Rym: you can write a photo for a while like, okay You can get the actual Epona and not just some other horses, but it's like she's not as good as calamitous my giant Ganon steed.

457
00:27:33,823 --> 00:27:34,339
Scott: Yeah, you mean?

458
00:27:36,722 --> 00:27:38,836
Scott: The horse the demon horse.

459
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:41,919
Scott: anyway the fist King rides.

460
00:27:43,601 --> 00:27:47,980
Scott: Yeah, but now there's some Metroid games coming for the old DS, right?

461
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,509
Scott: There's that remake of Metroid to come for the DS.

462
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:53,200
Scott: Yep, and you can hook some amiibos up to it.

463
00:27:53,360 --> 00:28:02,594
Scott: It's specifically and it's not just any amiibos and specifically these Metroid amiibos But that new me amiibo the one with the Metroid on the broken canister.

464
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:10,999
Scott: if you get that amiibo It's specifically unlocks like hard mode and there's like actual game content is locked behind this amiibo.

465
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:27,157
Scott: now It's like I could probably find someone who has the amiibo and like wave it near my DS and be good to go but or I would just do the pirate how much the fucking amiibos cost I. And also it's sort of like stealth deal like you're really charged like it's like it's like.

466
00:28:27,177 --> 00:28:30,759
Scott: on the one hand you can say All right, you sell a DLC and you get a free statue.

467
00:28:31,582 --> 00:28:32,728
Scott: Now you can think of it that way.

468
00:28:32,749 --> 00:28:33,694
Scott: it's like oh here's a deal.

469
00:28:33,714 --> 00:28:34,579
Scott: this game has a DLC.

470
00:28:34,861 --> 00:28:41,840
Rym: It feels dirty to sell a physical piece of plastic and then say oh you need this to play the full game.

471
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:46,677
Scott: Well, it feels a little less dirty because you one person buys the piece of plastic and waves at night.

472
00:28:46,797 --> 00:28:47,379
Scott: Everyone's DS.

473
00:28:48,003 --> 00:28:52,888
Scott: Yeah, so you don't actually need to pay for it for everybody Right, but it's like this is still like.

474
00:28:52,968 --> 00:28:55,597
Scott: am I really gonna be able to find someone who has this fucking amiibo, right?

475
00:28:56,621 --> 00:29:00,020
Scott: I still have never waved even one amiibo near any of my Nintendo console.

476
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,145
Rym: But also I've read if I.

477
00:29:01,325 --> 00:29:04,780
Scott: the thing is if I get that Metroid game, which I will I really want that mode.

478
00:29:04,941 --> 00:29:08,600
Scott: Yeah, I want that I pay I want that and I don't want to buy that amiibo.

479
00:29:08,721 --> 00:29:09,980
Scott: I think there's a useless piece of plastic.

480
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:16,331
Rym: There's a wider problem that the amiibos Themselves sort of had a bubble and I feel like there's amiibo fatigue.

481
00:29:16,351 --> 00:29:16,913
Rym: is the problem.

482
00:29:16,993 --> 00:29:22,140
Rym: is people who collected them early really like them For their physical people who are nuts on collecting all the amiibos?

483
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,966
Scott: Yeah, but now I think they're gonna run out of space.

484
00:29:23,987 --> 00:29:26,335
Scott: the Nintendo store had a big ol amiibo section.

485
00:29:26,355 --> 00:29:27,720
Scott: Everyone is into the amiibos.

486
00:29:27,902 --> 00:29:29,699
Rym: I'm just waiting for the amiibo bubble to crash.

487
00:29:31,244 --> 00:29:41,040
Scott: Yeah, I'm not an amiibo fan But anyway things of the day.

488
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,044
Rym: What do you got for me?

489
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:53,469
Scott: Oh, so I you know We always talk about apparently we mispronounced his name wrong Neil Ciciriga the one of the creators of all great internet things.

490
00:29:54,371 --> 00:29:56,699
Scott: Right, you know, he's made some videos like that.

491
00:29:56,719 --> 00:29:59,590
Scott: You may have seen like what was that one in the arcade?

492
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:00,593
Scott: They did the long one.

493
00:30:00,613 --> 00:30:02,822
Rym: Oh, well, there's friend or foe.

494
00:30:02,962 --> 00:30:09,025
Scott: friend or foe is the one of the shorter one But if you don't know he is done like pop puppet pop Potter puppet pals.

495
00:30:09,045 --> 00:30:09,547
Rym: That was him.

496
00:30:09,728 --> 00:30:14,430
Rym: Yeah So many internet things like it boggles the mind.

497
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:24,902
Scott: Anyway, so he's got a new patreon with his friends here that he does videos with called guaranteed video and they have been guaranteeing videos and those videos have appeared.

498
00:30:24,983 --> 00:30:40,510
Scott: and the newest video is Everybody's pants now And I unironically fucking love that song and I had the original album on Came out and I love CNC music factory is my jam.

499
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:44,442
Scott: I figure they're like one step under Captain Jack in the same musical category.

500
00:30:44,964 --> 00:30:46,248
Rym: Oh, it's Captain Jack.

501
00:30:46,388 --> 00:30:47,685
Rym: Oh my god I can't believe it.

502
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:48,995
Rym: I love CNC music factory.

503
00:30:49,015 --> 00:31:00,622
Scott: They're great and They took that song and they changed the lyric to everybody's pants now and they made this great video And it is more than thing of the day worthy.

504
00:31:00,963 --> 00:31:06,710
Scott: you should patreon Guaranteed video so that you will be guaranteed video.

505
00:31:07,312 --> 00:31:11,171
Rym: I was guaranteed this video and I'm glad that I funded the creation of this video Mm-hmm.

506
00:31:11,412 --> 00:31:14,402
Rym: So someone tweeted this and it's just four strips.

507
00:31:14,482 --> 00:31:14,823
Rym: It's from.

508
00:31:14,843 --> 00:31:16,268
Rym: you know, there's a lot of manga.

509
00:31:16,388 --> 00:31:19,565
Scott: obviously There is more manga than you can read in your life.

510
00:31:19,665 --> 00:31:20,349
Scott: accept it now.

511
00:31:20,952 --> 00:31:39,183
Rym: But this one in particular doesn't look like this has ever been translated except some fan translations And it looks like it's just this really funny for kill me about link being kind of excitable and dumb and it's Really really really cute and way funnier than I expected it to be.

512
00:31:39,283 --> 00:31:40,747
Scott: and I'm kind of really in AIDS.

513
00:31:40,807 --> 00:31:41,710
Scott: Wind Waker link, right?

514
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:43,338

518
00:31:49,868 --> 00:31:55,050
Rym: Yep This is just really cute and funny and I highly recommend you find this wherever.

519
00:31:55,811 --> 00:32:02,457
Scott: There are lots of four commas that are You know out there and they're rarely Translated in the meta moment.

Scott: It's like the hotness.

527
00:32:15,971 --> 00:32:20,206
Scott: I'm probably gonna start it once I'm in a reading mood again because I just finished reading some.

528
00:32:20,287 --> 00:32:21,130
Scott: so I'll take a break.

Scott: I'm gonna burn I'm gonna.

537
00:32:32,811 --> 00:32:34,537
Scott: maybe maybe you've seen something.

538
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:35,199
Scott: I haven't seen.

539
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:38,389
Rym: I'm gonna see as soon as I can cuz I'm feeling it.

540
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:47,678
Rym: I I particularly appreciated that the korai horde not only came back but was used to very Excellent effect.

541
00:32:48,402 --> 00:32:49,750
Scott: Uh, you're not done with that korai horde.

542
00:32:49,911 --> 00:32:53,670
Rym: Well, the korai horde was used and then recovered to be used again.

543
00:32:54,273 --> 00:32:57,769
Rym: You're not done with that and I'm sure there is yet a third usage of it.

544
00:33:00,017 --> 00:33:02,209
Rym: That korai horde is already doing some good biz.

545
00:33:03,611 --> 00:33:05,538
Rym: The fact that it the fact that's the car.

546
00:33:05,558 --> 00:33:07,063
Scott: Let's actually get home with the show.

547
00:33:07,284 --> 00:33:09,190
Scott: Okay, so much prison nothing action.

548
00:33:09,572 --> 00:33:12,550
Rym: So there's this game called dream daddy a dating simulator.

549
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:13,514
Scott: And so this game was.

550
00:33:13,534 --> 00:33:17,810
Scott: I actually only saw the announcement for it like recently like weeks months

551
00:33:18,617 --> 00:33:19,869
Rym: Came out a couple weeks ago

552
00:33:20,132 --> 00:33:27,890
Scott: Yeah, I mean anyway, then it was well There was a little drama because they're like, oh we had to delay the release and like a couple weeks later It was released and it was like people got mad upset.

553
00:33:28,091 --> 00:33:31,450
Scott: I don't I'm like people do not announce release dates for anything.

554
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:34,440
Scott: Just let's say when it's done it's done and then put it out.

555
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:38,243
Rym: and mostly I don't understand the people who get mad when a release Date changes.

556
00:33:38,385 --> 00:33:42,170
Scott: Yeah Just I would never put out a release date for anything that I do ever.

557
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:44,530
Scott: I would just say I'm making this thing get hype.

558
00:33:44,771 --> 00:33:52,207
Scott: It's gonna come out when it's ready and then it'll be ready one day and I'll just release it surprise and people go Oh shit, and that's how I would do.

559
00:33:53,412 --> 00:33:56,469
Scott: And then you don't have to worry about delaying things cuz no one fucking knows.

560
00:33:56,489 --> 00:34:01,212
Rym: now This is on my radar for a while because obviously with pillified and like goes to Miami, you know I like.

561
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:05,466
Rym: I have a I'm very invested in visual novel scene.

562
00:34:05,487 --> 00:34:06,510
Scott: This is a visual now.

563
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:08,590
Rym: So I play a lot of visual novels for research.

564
00:34:08,931 --> 00:34:16,518
Rym: This one was all over my feed to the point that it felt like this omnipresent game Those are going to consume all right.

565
00:34:16,558 --> 00:34:17,141
Scott: So this is it.

566
00:34:17,161 --> 00:34:22,121
Rym: when I live-streamed it last night Almost everyone watching had never heard of it.

567
00:34:22,422 --> 00:34:24,050
Rym: What they were all like, what is this game?

568
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,495
Scott: Do you read internet?

569
00:34:25,534 --> 00:34:27,482
Rym: Yeah, you're talk to an old person.

570
00:34:27,944 --> 00:34:29,610
Scott: read internet all day every day.

571
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:33,201
Scott: Anyway, so this is a visual novel in which you date dads.

572
00:34:33,601 --> 00:34:33,882
Rym: like it.

573
00:34:33,943 --> 00:34:35,387
Scott: literally it does not have.

574
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:36,270
Scott: you are a dad.

575
00:34:36,571 --> 00:34:37,694
Scott: It's the visual novel.

576
00:34:37,754 --> 00:34:41,386
Scott: choose on adventure style not the Tokimeki simulation style.

577
00:34:41,426 --> 00:34:46,123
Rym: that I think is more fun But anyway, it's closer to that though than a lot of other visual now.

578
00:34:46,143 --> 00:34:52,898
Rym: It has some it's It pretends to have some yeah But anyway, but it doesn't both the.

579
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:53,922
Rym: the cleverness is.

580
00:34:53,962 --> 00:35:00,230
Rym: a lot of the greatest visual novels Appear to have a lot more going on in the back end than they actually do, correct?

581
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:03,004
Rym: But it doesn't matter because if you feel like it's there it's there.

582
00:35:03,064 --> 00:35:09,669
Scott: as far as games are concerned The story is you're dead a single dead and you move into this town, right?

583
00:35:09,729 --> 00:35:10,959
Scott: Oh, yeah I think you already live in the town.

584
00:35:10,979 --> 00:35:11,989
Scott: you're moving across town.

585
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:12,752
Rym: Yeah, you're moving.

586
00:35:12,772 --> 00:35:13,495
Scott: you're like you're moving.

587
00:35:13,515 --> 00:35:16,686
Scott: your point is you're moving to the cul-de-sac of dads.

588
00:35:16,867 --> 00:35:32,603
Scott: Yeah, like the dad Your daughter who is about to graduate high school It's her senior year of high school You move to a new house at a new cul-de-sac and every house in the cul-de-sac has a hot dad with or without children living in it.

589
00:35:33,689 --> 00:35:43,237
Scott: and You got a deal with your daughter and Because you know your your spouse is no more Maybe you'll hit on some of these dads.

590
00:35:43,598 --> 00:35:43,979
Rym: Yep.

591
00:35:44,441 --> 00:35:50,663
Rym: So I accidentally had sex with Robert like right away Like I wonder if there are any nice either town.

592
00:35:50,703 --> 00:35:52,310
Scott: There's there's these seven dads.

Scott: They show you that are like the seven dads on down.

594
00:35:54,659 --> 00:35:55,864
Rym: You think there's like an eighth day.

595
00:35:55,924 --> 00:35:57,470
Scott: Is there a secret eighth dad?

596
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:03,457
Scott: Because I didn't put a lot of effort in trying to unlock anything or do any good Play through once.

597
00:36:03,497 --> 00:36:04,181
Rym: just I wanted like.

598
00:36:04,563 --> 00:36:07,214
Scott: I just played through real fast straight through.

599
00:36:07,234 --> 00:36:11,494
Rym: I thought a lot of my design made my dad avatar and You may look like you.

600
00:36:11,694 --> 00:36:15,670
Rym: it looks exactly like me except I put the mustache back cuz it's dead.

601
00:36:16,051 --> 00:36:21,790
Rym: Mine looks a little like me cuz two people in the chat were like the default avatar looks exactly like Scott.

602
00:36:22,162 --> 00:36:25,601
Scott: Yeah The thing is you can really make the.

603
00:36:25,721 --> 00:36:26,785
Scott: the dad maker was like.

604
00:36:26,845 --> 00:36:28,230
Scott: it's almost like that in itself.

605
00:36:28,451 --> 00:36:31,490
Scott: Remember that MMO with the superheroes where you could really go nuts?

606
00:36:31,671 --> 00:36:34,263
Scott: Oh, yeah, it's like the dad maker is pretty.

607
00:36:34,464 --> 00:36:40,557
Rym: it's not quite me level But it's pretty like I clicked around and like a few minutes later I had a perfect Rym.

608
00:36:40,637 --> 00:36:43,230
Scott: you can make a lot of good dads with the dad.

609
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:46,664
Scott: Did you see someone made dad maker alone is worth buying this game.

610
00:36:47,045 --> 00:36:50,376
Rym: right after the game came out This hit my Twitter feed like eight different ways.

611
00:36:50,636 --> 00:36:54,346
Scott: Someone made Roger Klotz and made I don't know who Roger Klotz from Doug.

612
00:36:54,366 --> 00:36:59,614
Scott: Oh with the orange the green face in the orange hair Klotz.

613
00:37:00,612 --> 00:37:07,790
Rym: That guy yeah made him perfect except he's not green cuz I can't make sure he's like perfect like almost too perfect.

614
00:37:08,178 --> 00:37:08,609
Scott: Yeah, why not?

615
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:10,719
Rym: But the beauty of this game is just that.

616
00:37:10,739 --> 00:37:17,030
Rym: it's called dream daddy a dad dating simulator And you both are a dad and date dads because that that would be the question.

617
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:20,246
Rym: So am I a dad trying to date or am I trying to date dads?

618
00:37:20,427 --> 00:37:20,929
Rym: It's both

619
00:37:21,271 --> 00:37:21,913
Scott: Mm-hmm,

620
00:37:22,675 --> 00:37:27,590
Rym: and I really liked it and it actually did a lot of clever things that I haven't seen in a lot of visual novels

621
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:35,750
Scott: Yeah, so first of all, like the plot that involves the daughter is actually kind of like a decent plot Like, you know you learn, you know.

622
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:38,809
Scott: And it's like even though I'm not a parent and have no plans to be.

623
00:37:39,392 --> 00:38:04,172
Scott: You can feel this frustration in these like just these multiple choice dialogue options right now of between being like the Overprotective parent or being the not enough parent right and it's like oh this is that and you can you know It's like whoever wrote this did a good job and there's like a little bit of voice acting that did a good job All you know, there's like oh, yeah It's like, you know It's like.

624
00:38:04,232 --> 00:38:09,070
Scott: it's really really well crafted using the thing that I care about the most always as a piece of software.

625
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:10,775
Scott: Is it well craft it just works.

626
00:38:10,936 --> 00:38:14,667
Scott: It's like yeah, it works perfectly, you know, it works at all resolutions.

627
00:38:14,728 --> 00:38:17,981
Scott: It's smooth There's no weird lags or control problems.

628
00:38:18,042 --> 00:38:21,193
Scott: I get it's basically just perfect It saves.

629
00:38:21,214 --> 00:38:25,070
Scott: the one thing it does really nice as a piece of software is it saves the game basically constantly.

630
00:38:25,291 --> 00:38:27,760
Scott: Yep, so you it's basically like having a choose your own adventure.

631
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:30,690
Scott: that automatically puts a million fingers in all the pages.

632
00:38:30,932 --> 00:38:33,490
Rym: That's a real important part of the UX of a good visual novel.

633
00:38:33,571 --> 00:38:37,678
Scott: You can always go back and load and redo anything you want But basically what it is?

634
00:38:37,718 --> 00:38:39,389
Scott: the game starts up with the intro day.

635
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:40,194
Rym: That's all.

636
00:38:40,214 --> 00:38:45,029
Rym: it starts with that song and had they had like it's so well It has its own theme song about dads, right?

637
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:47,298
Scott: So on the intro day you sort of go around.

638
00:38:47,318 --> 00:38:50,590
Scott: you move and you meet all the town and get set up with the basics.

639
00:38:51,032 --> 00:38:56,029
Scott: Then eventually on the next day or after that is a barbecue where like all the dads are there.

640
00:38:56,733 --> 00:39:00,470
Scott: After that barbecue the next day you wake up and you learn how to use dad book.

641
00:39:00,591 --> 00:39:07,800
Scott: So in dad book is basically Facebook just for dads plus dating And there's all the dads profiles there and you can mess it.

642
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:18,410
Scott: you can choose which dad to message and the seven dads Yep, and whichever dad you message will say yes and go hang out with you that day And you can similar to Tokimeki like who you can hang out with this weekend, right?

643
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:26,963
Scott: You choose one of the dads and then you get some dad plot and you get some daughter plot and you know You hang out with that dad and stuff happens and basically you can hang out with.

644
00:39:27,144 --> 00:39:34,005
Scott: as far as I can tell because I only did Basically, I you know one dad pretty much but basically I did one dad.

645
00:39:34,466 --> 00:39:35,650
Scott: then I did a different dad.

646
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:37,443
Scott: Do the dad or just hang out with the dad?

647
00:39:37,503 --> 00:39:38,410
Scott: I chose one dad.

648
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:40,701
Scott: Okay, because I chose vampire dad.

649
00:39:40,822 --> 00:39:46,189
Scott: then on the second the second day I chose banana bread dad and then I went back to vampire dad.

650
00:39:46,209 --> 00:39:52,960
Scott: and Then if you choose the vampire dad or any dad a third time, they're like, you know This is gonna basically end the game.

651
00:39:53,101 --> 00:39:58,639
Scott: once you choose a dad a third time You're committing to that dad and it's like alright I'll just commit to vampire dad and end the game.

652
00:39:58,679 --> 00:40:02,359
Scott: so I did and obviously I didn't get the best ending Right, but I got.

653
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:04,630
Scott: I learned a lot about vampire dad, right?

654
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:05,974
Scott: I chose him a third time

655
00:40:05,994 --> 00:40:12,440
Rym: because a big part of visual novels like this kind is you want like you expect people to play through it a bunch to sort of plumb the depths of all right,

656
00:40:12,922 --> 00:40:13,564
Scott: so I think the way

657
00:40:13,584 --> 00:40:14,147
Rym: the plot

658
00:40:14,167 --> 00:40:21,531
Scott: I think what you want to Do if you want to really completely do this game is do every dad twice Right.

659
00:40:22,094 --> 00:40:27,670
Scott: go to yeah, you can see on dad book Every dad is three hearts because every time you hang out with them you get one heart.

660
00:40:28,072 --> 00:40:37,896
Scott: So hang out with every dad two times to see a ton of plot Save the game and then do the third Episode of each dad one at a time

661
00:40:37,916 --> 00:40:38,779
Rym: and

662
00:40:38,819 --> 00:40:48,004
Scott: then that will be an efficient way to go through the game with all dads And try to get you know The best endings and see all of the things there are to see in the game.

663
00:40:48,024 --> 00:40:53,370
Scott: because like I did it I'm gonna have to load the game way back and go to different dad.

664
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:55,499
Rym: So the thing is you're just gonna have to play it again, I think.

665
00:40:55,540 --> 00:41:02,970
Rym: because yeah based on what I played so far There's like a lot of the choices are arbitrary and just lead to like a slightly different funny joke.

666
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:08,610
Scott: But sometimes you'll one choice will like make hearts come out of a dad and another choice will make like a black smoke come out.

667
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:18,710
Rym: But also some choices will radically like will give you scenes You will not see otherwise just in the middle like in the first day You can have sex with Robert like right away even on the intro day.

668
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:20,602
Scott: Yeah, not and you didn't even go to dad book.

669
00:41:20,622 --> 00:41:21,770
Rym: I didn't even know dad would existed.

670
00:41:21,951 --> 00:41:35,149
Rym: I already had sex with Robert while my daughter had a slumber party and then I woke up in his apartment Hung over and he's like, yeah, you should probably leave and I'm like, oh shit I hope my daughter's alive cuz I just left her home alone.

671
00:41:35,531 --> 00:41:38,648
Scott: Yeah, I saw Robert in the back of the coffee shop and didn't talk to him.

672
00:41:38,688 --> 00:41:43,530
Rym: coffee shop No Because I did not want to let anyone get in the way of me and Matt getting together.

673
00:41:43,911 --> 00:41:46,037
Rym: Cuz Matt is the best dad and there's no one fight me.

674
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:47,261
Scott: Well, okay.

675
00:41:47,502 --> 00:41:50,350
Scott: So here's the thing with the dads at least what I gather.

676
00:41:50,471 --> 00:41:54,608
Scott: I don't want to like spoil any of these because the game is it's just a book right?

677
00:41:54,689 --> 00:41:55,030
Scott: It's a choose?

678
00:41:55,131 --> 00:41:55,714
Scott: Well, I don't.

679
00:41:55,774 --> 00:41:57,283
Scott: well, I don't believe the trademark term.

680
00:41:57,303 --> 00:41:58,530
Rym: So it's not a choose your own right.

681
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:00,955
Scott: But while I don't believe in spoilers I still not gonna.

682
00:42:01,055 --> 00:42:03,809
Scott: you know, I'm not gonna tell you anything cuz I want you to buy this game.

683
00:42:04,471 --> 00:42:05,434
Scott: Yeah, I like.

684
00:42:05,474 --> 00:42:06,758
Scott: I think the way it works.

685
00:42:06,818 --> 00:42:07,620
Rym: I'm gonna play some more.

686
00:42:07,981 --> 00:42:11,130
Scott: each dad on the surface seems to have a stereotype, right?

687
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:13,900
Scott: There's your old college roommate who seems a sporty dad.

688
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,084
Scott: Yeah, there's a bunch of kids.

689
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:18,437
Scott: There's the Christian ish yuppie.

690
00:42:18,537 --> 00:42:28,390
Scott: Where's a you know, looks like a guy from Scooby-doo who is clearly married to a demon from beyond?

691
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,206
Rym: It's had demon children, right?

692
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:33,990
Scott: It's like the stereotype surface level you see of all these guys, right?

693
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:34,692
Scott: Is you know?

694
00:42:34,792 --> 00:42:37,061
Scott: cool coffee shop owning banana bread.

695
00:42:37,101 --> 00:42:38,827
Scott: dad who Rym like thinks his best dad.

696
00:42:38,867 --> 00:42:39,610
Scott: He has the best voice.

697
00:42:40,493 --> 00:42:41,997
Scott: I thought he was best dad on day one.

698
00:42:42,038 --> 00:42:42,318
Scott: Also.

699
00:42:42,479 --> 00:42:45,950
Scott: Yeah, there's teacher dad sexy teacher dead.

700
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:46,894
Rym: Yep, there's.

701
00:42:47,095 --> 00:42:49,405
Rym: I points to him for being an insufferable pedant.

702
00:42:49,747 --> 00:42:58,430
Scott: Oh, yeah vampire dad Bad dad who's the one room had sex with so bad dads were in the the Vaughn from eska flown a shirt.

703
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:03,210
Rym: So I'm assuming this is like washed up Vaughn when he finally made it, you know, it's sunglasses motorcycle alcohol.

704
00:43:03,592 --> 00:43:06,503
Scott: He's like hey dog with spike necklace dad, right?

705
00:43:06,523 --> 00:43:08,109
Rym: I just saw when I went to the bar.

706
00:43:08,893 --> 00:43:21,904
Rym: There's like this shitty dive bar in town and I went there to watch sports ball but with to avoid having to be around all my daughter at a slumber party and First the wife of the middle guy tried to sex me and I was like hell.

707
00:43:21,944 --> 00:43:27,770
Rym: no and then this guy was like Hey, and I was like, hey and then one thing led to another and I was in his apartment.

708
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:28,412
Rym: Where's house?

709
00:43:28,813 --> 00:43:34,510
Scott: Hey, and then the final dad is the you know, the large, you know, oh, oh dad.

710
00:43:34,831 --> 00:43:40,950
Scott: Yeah, the you know the grilling and lawnmowing and sort of Viking ish kind of dad.

711
00:43:41,171 --> 00:43:43,059
Rym: It's complicated by the fact that they're all dads.

712
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:45,610
Rym: They'll have kids, but they all have very different kids situations.

713
00:43:45,731 --> 00:43:46,780
Rym: Some of the kids are good.

714
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:51,930
Rym: Some of them are bad Some of them are complicated, but anyway baby is not real because it never blinks.

715
00:43:52,303 --> 00:43:54,858
Scott: Yeah But anyway, the point is each of the dads.

716
00:43:54,918 --> 00:44:03,210
Scott: I think what happens is on the based on my judgment of vampire Dad is that on the third day of each of the dad you revealed his corn chip stash to you.

717
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:06,482
Scott: They revealed that there's another side to them that you don't see.

718
00:44:06,522 --> 00:44:11,194
Scott: you only see the stereotyped Sort of character that they you know They appear to be.

719
00:44:11,234 --> 00:44:16,142
Scott: so you only see vampire stuff for day one and day two and on day three You see what is really like.

720
00:44:16,182 --> 00:44:16,909
Scott: it's really a Larpur.

721
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:32,935
Scott: So I think that with all these other dads I Assume the same thing will happen that if I go out with them one two times I'll just see like if I hung out with college roommate dad I'd see him doing Sportsy stuff with his kids for day one and two and I think on day three like I'd learn his real Real deal that

722
00:44:32,956 --> 00:44:35,127
Rym: the kid he's carrying around everywhere is actually a robot.

723
00:44:35,308 --> 00:44:37,054
Rym: maybe Doesn't blink.

724
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:39,270
Rym: every other character blinks, but not that baby, right?

725
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,757
Scott: But I think that's generally the deal right.

726
00:44:42,098 --> 00:44:50,290
Rym: so so a really important aspect is that it has a lot of sort of Sort of minigames and some of them like are literally like a Pokemon battle.

727
00:44:50,491 --> 00:44:52,459
Rym: Yeah, and some of them you don't really.

728
00:44:52,479 --> 00:44:54,749
Rym: you don't quite realize it's a minigame until you lose it.

729
00:44:55,151 --> 00:45:16,310
Rym: like at one point we're cooking for cooking breakfast hungover with my daughter and That she says a weird word like Macadamia gazebo and my prompt is I can say a bunch of those words to check on the bacon and At first I'm trying to ignore her because I have a hangover and I don't want her prodding into the fact that I sex Robert.

730
00:45:16,371 --> 00:45:17,509
Rym: That'll have the previous night.

731
00:45:18,052 --> 00:45:28,067
Rym: So I just keep checking on the bacon and then she starts playing this word game with me and I as a player and this Is in the live stream legit get into it and start playing the word game with her in the voice dialogues.

732
00:45:28,428 --> 00:45:30,770
Rym: and because I didn't Check on the bacon it catches fire.

733
00:45:31,851 --> 00:45:35,361
Scott: Yeah, there's also actual like video game games like this one I go to.

734
00:45:35,381 --> 00:45:38,450
Scott: I went to a concert with the dad the Rym likes.

735
00:45:38,631 --> 00:45:46,509
Scott: Oh, yeah, right and after going to the concert, it's like when I first saw him on the intro day I thought he was best dad, but after going to the concert I wasn't into him as much.

736
00:45:47,731 --> 00:45:51,230
Scott: But there was a mini just so hot that I'll overlook almost anything and he's still the hottest.

737
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:57,950
Scott: Yeah but basically during the During that concert there was an actual game that was like get to the front of the crowd because I basically I went to the bathroom.

738
00:45:58,010 --> 00:45:58,873
Scott: Then the concert started.

739
00:45:58,893 --> 00:46:06,550
Scott: I had to basically find him in the crowd and like push my way up to the front and that game Was sort of not well programmed.

740
00:46:06,771 --> 00:46:12,369
Scott: It was sort of a pain in the ass and not the greatest and I lost it Because I couldn't figure out what the hell was going on.

741
00:46:15,732 --> 00:46:20,850
Scott: It was an actual video game and not a. it's like you had to maneuver in real time.

742
00:46:21,231 --> 00:46:22,957
Scott: It wasn't just multiple choice choices.

743
00:46:22,997 --> 00:46:26,528
Scott: It's like this other thing that affected the actual game and I

744
00:46:26,548 --> 00:46:28,821
Rym: for a second I thought I remember when you in order

745
00:46:28,861 --> 00:46:32,079
Scott: to play all of these little mini games I think you're gonna have to go out with each member

746
00:46:32,099 --> 00:46:34,873
Rym: in earth found you got to push through all the cultists to get to The big cultists.

747
00:46:35,194 --> 00:46:42,029
Rym: Yeah similar, but I feel like with all these little minigame things It's interesting because a lot of them sort of like that one in particular, right?

748
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:45,361
Rym: The way the dialogue goes you're like you.

749
00:46:45,501 --> 00:46:51,210
Rym: the dad the dad Sona that you make Kinda like not super social and not really well versed

750
00:46:51,250 --> 00:47:04,990
Scott: you don't have any choice in your own personality is like your dad is sort of a not like a do-nothing doesn't have a lot of Interests and is socially awkward and not socially awkward like he behaves in a bad way like at that guy.

751
00:47:05,332 --> 00:47:06,640
Scott: But then he's just like shy.

752
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:23,185
Scott: Yeah introverted Right, and it's really really cares about his daughter a lot But doesn't really like have anything interesting going on other than that, you know, yeah Warm caring kind of person, but he's not a complete self-insert because he has some right.

753
00:47:23,225 --> 00:47:26,135
Scott: if you're an extroverted like go-getter You can't be that.

754
00:47:26,377 --> 00:47:29,049
Scott: Yeah, you can't you know, you can try to force yourself to do that.

755
00:47:29,411 --> 00:47:33,307
Scott: But even if you choose those options like I'm gonna you know, it basically it's.

756
00:47:33,508 --> 00:47:38,209
Scott: it comes It doesn't come off as a guy who actually is extroverted but as a dad who is you know?

757
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:48,881
Scott: Do is still introverted but he's going out there because he knows he should and he's you know, succeeding and fighting himself Yeah as opposed to actually being the person you are.

758
00:47:49,041 --> 00:47:55,286
Rym: but to review it and again to not spoil anything because I think it's worth Playing it's if you're this game is really good.

759
00:47:55,306 --> 00:47:58,799
Rym: Oh, yeah Yeah, I laughed out loud repeatedly.

760
00:47:58,879 --> 00:47:59,622
Scott: It's real funny.

761
00:47:59,642 --> 00:48:01,167
Scott: It's well written.

762
00:48:01,227 --> 00:48:06,367
Rym: It's well made It's well crafted and there's clever stuff in the UX like little things like most visual.

763
00:48:06,387 --> 00:48:13,564
Scott: when the dads kissed I was like, I was actually like, ooh, yeah It wasn't just like, you know, it's like, you know, what's gonna happen, right?

764
00:48:13,744 --> 00:48:14,929
Scott: Yeah, you think it would just be like man.

765
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:17,197
Scott: All right, we finally got to that part, but it's like.

766
00:48:17,278 --> 00:48:17,960
Scott: I was actually like.

767
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,610
Rym: I don't think there are explicit sex.

768
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:21,292
Rym: Like you can.

769
00:48:21,312 --> 00:48:23,580
Rym: you can straight-up have explicit sex, but it doesn't just show that.

770
00:48:24,022 --> 00:48:24,865
Scott: but nothing was.

771
00:48:25,066 --> 00:48:26,169
Scott: never is no visual.

772
00:48:26,671 --> 00:48:31,147
Scott: Even the kissing was not even visually displayed on the screen, but there were words.

773
00:48:31,228 --> 00:48:31,910
Scott: it definitely happened.

774
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:36,605
Rym: It's like oh and we kissed when I when I when I sexed Robert on the first night.

775
00:48:37,127 --> 00:48:38,110
Rym: It was very well written.

776
00:48:38,472 --> 00:48:39,416
Rym: Yeah, put it that way.

777
00:48:39,436 --> 00:48:41,406
Rym: I could see why Robert is an attractive gentleman.

778
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:46,130
Scott: Mm-hmm But was it actually going into details about like your butt or whatever?

779
00:48:46,853 --> 00:48:50,887
Rym: It went into details about where he grabbed me and hips and things and it was pretty.

780
00:48:50,948 --> 00:48:55,589
Rym: it was pretty good Yeah, but there's the UX is pretty clever, too.

781
00:48:55,890 --> 00:48:59,325
Rym: So like it'll have a really good background like the fonts and everything are great.

782
00:48:59,386 --> 00:49:02,719
Rym: the things that like That'll that's the only thing that'll break me out of visual novel is there.

783
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:04,084
Rym: the font kerning is bad.

784
00:49:04,104 --> 00:49:05,810
Rym: The font spacing is bad.

785
00:49:05,871 --> 00:49:06,035
Rym: There's.

786
00:49:06,117 --> 00:49:15,129
Scott: oh, yeah Not only did it not have those problems, but I was able to rapidly push the spacebar to get through text crazy fast But if you don't which is really good for my eyes.

787
00:49:15,710 --> 00:49:21,750
Rym: Timing and cadence is actually someone put way more effort into the text cadence than they probably even needed.

788
00:49:21,852 --> 00:49:22,930
Scott: I mean, it's correct, right?

789
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:23,797
Scott: It's not usually.

790
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:28,470
Scott: that's something that would bother me a lot But I was able to fly through at my reading speed and get through the game nicely.

791
00:49:28,691 --> 00:49:33,430
Rym: But if you let the game do the text reveal on its own it doesn't feel slow.

792
00:49:33,591 --> 00:49:33,912
Scott: It's just.

793
00:49:34,013 --> 00:49:35,480
Scott: you know, you still push the spacebar though.

794
00:49:35,721 --> 00:49:37,510
Rym: Mostly I was doing it slower because I was live streaming it.

795
00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:39,157
Rym: So I want to make sure everyone can follow along.

796
00:49:39,197 --> 00:49:39,478
Scott: Yeah,

797
00:49:39,779 --> 00:50:05,737
Rym: and partly I'd waited cuz I was laughing out loud a lot but also like so it shows dialogue boxes based on when people are talking and The characters react pretty well, but it also has a separate dialogue box for any inner monologue which is important because a lot of visual novels have trouble differentiating between characters saying something versus descriptive text and the descriptive text is framed as Your own inner monologue with a different box.

798
00:50:06,038 --> 00:50:09,550
Rym: and all these factors together the UX is nearly impeccable.

799
00:50:10,752 --> 00:50:15,706
Rym: There I can come up with very few criticisms of how the games actually put together.

800
00:50:15,886 --> 00:50:22,924
Scott: another thing that happens is After each date with a dad you this score screen comes up.

801
00:50:23,125 --> 00:50:24,530
Scott: Oh, yeah and the score screen.

802
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:34,929
Scott: I don't know how much of it is real and fake but you do get like an s-rank a-rank c-rank d-rank f-rank with that dad And I think that that does have some effect on where the game goes.

803
00:50:35,491 --> 00:50:40,370
Scott: You get all s-ranks of the dad, I'm pretty sure you you get better stuff with them.

804
00:50:40,831 --> 00:50:46,110
Scott: I think my ranks like a then C then s or was it s CS?

805
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:46,996
Scott: I don't know.

806
00:50:47,056 --> 00:50:48,488
Rym: I got a big part of why I was into.

807
00:50:48,528 --> 00:50:50,014
Rym: Matt The the coffee shop guy.

808
00:50:50,074 --> 00:50:51,257
Rym: was that I?

809
00:50:51,478 --> 00:50:54,186
Rym: he really liked my name for the banana bread.

810
00:50:54,467 --> 00:50:55,490
Rym: like way liked it.

811
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:56,352
Scott: Which one did you choose?

812
00:50:56,593 --> 00:50:58,238
Rym: I already don't remember what the options were.

813
00:50:58,338 --> 00:51:00,385
Scott: He really liked mine, which one was yours.

814
00:51:00,485 --> 00:51:06,587
Scott: I forget banana bread Dream Daddy.

815
00:51:07,811 --> 00:51:09,118
Rym: The problem is I'm reading Princeton nothing.

816
00:51:09,138 --> 00:51:10,263
Rym: So I got too many right.

817
00:51:10,303 --> 00:51:10,986
Rym: right said bread.

818
00:51:11,027 --> 00:51:11,710
Scott: That's what I chose.

819
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:19,235
Rym: I chose right said banana bread also, but the fact that he has good taste means that he's like he's my main man My main dad.

820
00:51:19,255 --> 00:51:21,850
Rym: so far unless I learned like he's a serial killer or something.

821
00:51:22,452 --> 00:51:24,180
Scott: I mean, I think all the dads have a secret.

822
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,530
Scott: after that after the third date the game ends.

823
00:51:26,912 --> 00:51:30,149
Scott: You know once you get a third date with a dad and then you learn their real deal.

824
00:51:31,113 --> 00:51:40,003
Rym: I worry what would have happened if I'd bought a drink for the bad lady Mmm, because she comes over and like aggressively flirts with you.

825
00:51:40,023 --> 00:51:43,964
Scott: I learned about her actually in Vampire Dead's third day.

826
00:51:44,105 --> 00:51:50,457
Scott: Oh Even though like I didn't think I would see her at all because I didn't go into Area of the game.

827
00:51:50,678 --> 00:51:57,230
Scott: I think I get her deal by dealing with him But I'll say that she was doing quite the opposite of evil in that area.

828
00:51:57,913 --> 00:52:01,130
Scott: So if you want to see some non-evil of that lady go to the vampire.

829
00:52:01,211 --> 00:52:03,890
Rym: I only assume she's evil because her kids are clearly demon.

830
00:52:03,930 --> 00:52:08,930
Scott: I think it's just the way they draw her face on purpose to make her know her kids are clearly inhuman.

831
00:52:09,611 --> 00:52:11,658
Rym: They're like Anna syramore kids.

832
00:52:12,059 --> 00:52:12,401
Scott: Yeah.

833
00:52:12,983 --> 00:52:14,990
Scott: No, but I mean I got the at least from the barbecue.

834
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:19,287
Scott: I actually did like hated her husband and I thought she was probably I don't like her husband either.

835
00:52:19,328 --> 00:52:20,272
Rym: He's bad news I don't like.

836
00:52:20,292 --> 00:52:21,359
Rym: I didn't like either one of them.

837
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,909
Scott: Well, they're the Jesus II type people.

838
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:28,446
Rym: If I had to rank them based on the surface only it's definitely but I seem like the Pleasantville.

839
00:52:28,547 --> 00:52:31,355
Scott: very it's like yeah No good banana bread guy.

840
00:52:31,375 --> 00:52:33,362
Rym: I feel like Roberts got some hidden depths.

841
00:52:33,723 --> 00:52:33,964
Scott: Mm-hmm.

842
00:52:34,004 --> 00:52:34,566
Rym: I feel like there's.

843
00:52:35,027 --> 00:52:35,830
Rym: there's something there.

844
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:36,434
Rym: That's good.

845
00:52:36,535 --> 00:52:37,482
Scott: They all have hidden depths.

846
00:52:37,543 --> 00:52:44,380
Rym: Yeah, of course I mean, I guess his hidden death could be just worse than what he is on the surface Mmm, like oh, I'm a rebel.

847
00:52:44,441 --> 00:52:44,924
Rym: No, really.

848
00:52:44,964 --> 00:52:45,869
Rym: I killed a bunch of people.

849
00:52:47,632 --> 00:52:49,629
Rym: So yeah, this game is like super legit.

850
00:52:49,649 --> 00:52:53,006
Rym: good Even if you don't think you like visual novels, like I recommend it.

851
00:52:53,066 --> 00:52:53,548
Rym: It's not that.

852
00:52:53,569 --> 00:52:55,943
Scott: yeah I think this is actually a great like.

853
00:52:55,963 --> 00:52:59,231
Scott: if you are someone who hasn't played visual novels like.

854
00:52:59,271 --> 00:53:12,824
Scott: this is something that you could introduce to even people who aren't visual novel people or You know see if see if you're gonna like visual novel dude I think and this is so appropriate for anyone who's over like 18 or 16.

855
00:53:12,824 --> 00:53:14,690
Rym: My mom would legit like this game.

856
00:53:14,851 --> 00:53:18,448
Rym: Yeah, I don't know if my dad would but I mom my mom would definitely play this game.

857
00:53:18,689 --> 00:53:25,510
Scott: Yeah This game is so You know as such a broad appeal to anyone who has no problem with gayness.

858
00:53:26,052 --> 00:53:30,710
Scott: I'm uh, you can use it probably as a great way to detect if someone is a good person or a bad person.

859
00:53:30,810 --> 00:53:31,873
Scott: They don't like this game.

860
00:53:31,893 --> 00:53:33,477
Scott: They're probably a bad person.

861
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:37,367
Rym: Uh, uh, I feel like I'm looking forward to cosplay.

862
00:53:37,387 --> 00:53:39,575
Scott: Oh What a cosplay some day.

863
00:53:39,635 --> 00:53:40,981
Rym: I could be the vampire dad.

864
00:53:41,524 --> 00:53:42,910
Scott: You maybe could be the vampire dad.

865
00:53:43,051 --> 00:53:43,934
Rym: That's the only one I could be.

866
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:45,340
Scott: I can't be any of those dads.

867
00:53:45,561 --> 00:53:45,923
Rym: I'm not.

868
00:53:46,204 --> 00:53:47,470
Rym: I'm not hot enough to be most of them.

869
00:53:48,193 --> 00:53:52,130
Rym: Yeah, Pete could pull off Viking dad, I think if you grew a beard, yeah, it's a gross hair back.

870
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:53,618
Rym: Yeah, you could do it.

871
00:53:53,658 --> 00:53:57,835
Scott: No, none of the none of the dads in the game are bald Except if you make your own dad bald.

872
00:53:57,976 --> 00:54:02,027
Rym: Yeah, and I don't know anyone in person hot as hot as Matt.

873
00:54:02,348 --> 00:54:05,333
Scott: So Who do I know?

874
00:54:05,393 --> 00:54:07,019
Rym: that's that I know anyone that hot?

875
00:54:10,210 --> 00:54:10,832
Rym: I Got no one.

876
00:54:11,936 --> 00:54:12,076
Scott: Nope.

877
00:54:12,437 --> 00:54:12,638
Scott: Nope.

878
00:54:12,859 --> 00:54:12,999
Scott: Nope.

879
00:54:13,782 --> 00:54:15,828
Scott: I mean the dads are unrealistically hot.

880
00:54:15,929 --> 00:54:20,829
Rym: Yeah I Okay, I think we're done but you should play this game.

881
00:54:26,265 --> 00:54:28,800
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
