19
00:01:10,231 --> 00:01:12,038
Scott: There isn't any news about actual games.

20
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:15,270
Scott: then these tiny news is like some games came out, right?

21
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,021
Scott: So tumble seed which we've been talking about.

22
00:01:17,182 --> 00:01:18,772
Rym: Oh, yeah, we'll do a review of it Later.

23
00:01:18,792 --> 00:01:21,750
Rym: that games hard as balls are that is well.

24
00:01:22,171 --> 00:01:23,737
Rym: It's as hard as I expected it to be.

25
00:01:23,757 --> 00:01:24,841
Scott: I didn't expect it to be.

26
00:01:25,243 --> 00:01:26,969
Rym: you played ice-cold beer, right?

27
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:27,835
Scott: But I didn't.

28
00:01:27,976 --> 00:01:28,401
Scott: I didn't know.

29
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:33,930
Scott: the problem is like yeah I knew but it's like you can make an easy ice-cold beer right where there's like two holes and you right.

30
00:01:34,672 --> 00:01:35,837
Rym: You thought that's what they were gonna do me.

31
00:01:35,957 --> 00:01:38,245
Scott: it's hard right from the beginning.

32
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:39,670
Scott: it's like impossibly hard.

33
00:01:39,871 --> 00:01:42,169
Rym: How far is the highest you've ever gotten an ice-cold beer?

34
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,737
Scott: Listen, that's how my ice-cold beer I'm talking about tumble seat.

35
00:01:45,757 --> 00:01:46,018
Scott: Yes.

36
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:49,710
Rym: This is ice-cold beer plus roguelike nonsense, right?

37
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:50,713
Scott: But it's a video game.

38
00:01:50,753 --> 00:01:55,090
Scott: So I figure you'd have this curve where the first level would just have like a couple holes in it.

39
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:58,440
Scott: You know be like baby mode and then hard over time.

40
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,385
Scott: It's like no immediately in level one.

41
00:02:00,426 --> 00:02:01,168
Scott: It's balls hard.

42
00:02:01,228 --> 00:02:06,203
Scott: So anyway But strafe I think came out the oh, yeah, I backed that.

43
00:02:06,263 --> 00:02:08,330
Rym: I thought multiple people messaged me.

44
00:02:08,531 --> 00:02:13,830
Scott: I also kick-started it and that is a game that basically it looks like quake, but there's a trailer for it out.

45
00:02:14,171 --> 00:02:17,403
Scott: There's been a bunch of awesome trailers for it, but there's a new one.

46
00:02:17,423 --> 00:02:20,795
Scott: That's like basically like this epic Movie trailer thing.

47
00:02:20,835 --> 00:02:21,979
Scott: It's it's insane.

48
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:25,710
Scott: Like they supposed to spend more effort on this fucking trailer than on the actual game.

49
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:29,703
Scott: But yeah strafe the.

50
00:02:29,824 --> 00:02:32,851
Scott: if you want to play quake one on Steroids.

51
00:02:33,473 --> 00:02:35,037
Scott: that's brand-new in 2017.

52
00:02:35,037 --> 00:02:38,609
Rym: That's what strafe is just multiple peeler his website.

53
00:02:38,649 --> 00:02:44,674
Rym: here Multiple people have messaged me like just recently like hey, right Have you heard about this game?

54
00:02:44,694 --> 00:02:46,642
Rym: and I didn't remember it.

55
00:02:46,802 --> 00:02:51,702
Rym: I kick-started this until I looked and yes I actually backed it like day one, right?

56
00:02:52,063 --> 00:03:05,689
Rym: So, uh in some news eSports journalism You know the commentary commentation the color like all the stuff related to eSports still pretty amateur and has Shall we say?

57
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,433
Rym: Some troubles.

58
00:03:07,975 --> 00:03:08,497
Rym: Mm-hmm.

59
00:03:08,517 --> 00:03:13,885
Rym: So I saw a lot of people talking about this one eSports Article and here's the situation.

60
00:03:13,946 --> 00:03:19,670
Rym: Here's the headline Dream hack Austin melee tournament champion wins in the most pathetic way possible.

61
00:03:20,151 --> 00:03:21,956
Rym: Okay, so the store.

62
00:03:22,156 --> 00:03:27,610
Rym: now the best part about this article because most people were talking about this from solely a screenshot.

63
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:33,390
Rym: They could screenshot of the first paragraph of this and talked about like how much of a jerk this writer is.

64
00:03:33,811 --> 00:03:40,973
Rym: But the other half of Twitter was talking about how much of a jerk the guy the article is about is Okay.

65
00:03:41,114 --> 00:03:42,299
Rym: So here's the first paragraph.

66
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,865
Scott: what actually happened at the dream hang?

67
00:03:43,925 --> 00:03:45,050
Rym: I'll read the first paragraph first.

68
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:48,982
Rym: I don't like using the term douchebag too often in writing an online article.

69
00:03:49,263 --> 00:03:52,153
Rym: aside from the fact that I'm not a 20-something blogger looking For big hits.

70
00:03:52,193 --> 00:03:54,102
Rym: It's just not a favorable term.

71
00:03:54,122 --> 00:03:55,630
Scott: I don't care about this blog guy.

72
00:03:55,751 --> 00:03:58,330
Scott: I care about what happened at the gaming tournament the actual news.

73
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:01,710
Rym: So people are legit mad about what happened to the gaming - what happened at the gaming tournament?

74
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:07,750
Rym: So there's this whole drama about like the ladders and everything, but eventually it's a Smash Brothers melee tournament.

75
00:04:07,933 --> 00:04:08,643
Scott: I know that much.

76
00:04:08,663 --> 00:04:08,785
Scott: Yeah.

77
00:04:08,806 --> 00:04:09,834
Scott: All right I gathered that.

78
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:11,120
Rym: so quote.

79
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:20,570
Rym: at a certain point time during the match Both of them had three lives in stock But chewed at was heavily injured at 122 percent and the other guy had low percent hungry box.

80
00:04:22,172 --> 00:04:25,250
Rym: Already already had to earn his first kill and was having a hard time with the second.

81
00:04:25,772 --> 00:04:34,050
Rym: So he chose to do one of the biggest jerk moves you can add you can do as a gamer Run out the clock and he won the game by running out the clock, which I think is awesome.

82
00:04:34,311 --> 00:04:35,135
Scott: Why wouldn't you do that?

83
00:04:35,155 --> 00:04:36,441
Rym: That is literally what you should do.

84
00:04:36,461 --> 00:04:37,526
Scott: He had lower percent.

85
00:04:37,546 --> 00:04:38,310
Scott: So he was ahead, right?

86
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:40,016
Scott: So if the clock runs out he wins.

87
00:04:40,056 --> 00:04:43,629
Scott: yep, he just ran out the clock and the other guy couldn't catch it.

88
00:04:43,649 --> 00:04:51,410
Rym: now I'm sure a portion of you reading this we're gonna say something to the effect of well He did it within the rules and yeah, he did which should be the end of the argument, right?

89
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:54,000
Rym: If you don't let me pose a pose a scenario to you.

90
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,470
Scott: I mean you take a knee in football is how it works.

91
00:04:56,791 --> 00:05:02,269
Scott: It's like if you got a problem with that other a change the rules or be deal with it.

92
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:04,221
Rym: Yep, but he's like.

93
00:05:04,241 --> 00:05:11,993
Scott: but let me pose a question to you Also see how could he run out the clock the other guy who think one whose purses behind should be able to catch him and fight him?

94
00:05:12,536 --> 00:05:14,023
Rym: well the the example he gives us.

95
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:21,251
Rym: what if you're playing a fighting game and You haven't beaten the guy yet and there's less than 10 seconds and you have way more health and you just duck in the corner crouching Cuz?

96
00:05:21,271 --> 00:05:23,229
Rym: they can't do enough damage in those last 10 seconds.

97
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,155
Rym: Does that count?

98
00:05:25,236 --> 00:05:27,105
Rym: like this whole article poses this question?

99
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,150
Rym: Yeah, does that count?

100
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:33,390
Scott: I scored enough points and there's 10 seconds left in the football game To touchdowns in 10 seconds.

101
00:05:35,053 --> 00:05:36,519
Scott: Did they really win?

102
00:05:36,861 --> 00:05:38,850
Rym: were they really better than you?

103
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:40,233
Scott: Yeah, they got it.

104
00:05:40,254 --> 00:05:42,349
Scott: They got ahead of you and you weren't able to catch up.

105
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:43,493
Scott: That's how games work.

106
00:05:43,694 --> 00:05:48,890
Rym: or were they just a durch bag douche bag with a smirk on their face exploiting the game for an easy win?

107
00:05:50,195 --> 00:05:53,329
Scott: No They're a better gamer.

108
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,535
Scott: So we they use that.

109
00:05:55,816 --> 00:05:59,730
Scott: they did things within the rules in order to achieve victory.

110
00:06:00,355 --> 00:06:01,161
Scott: That is gaming.

111
00:06:01,524 --> 00:06:02,249
Rym: So I saw this.

112
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:03,459
Scott: I

113
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:31,338
Rym: literally saw to come 180 degrees separated takes all based on this one article from DreamHack where half the internet seems to think that This is great eSports journalism and that like they're calling this guy out for being a jerk and then normal intelligent people like us and the people who were saying that this writer is terrible and that eSports journalism is by and large terrible pointing out that you play to win the game if The end of a game is unsatisfying.

114
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:32,623
Rym: That's the game's fault.

115
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,410
Rym: Not the players fault, right?

116
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,790
Scott: But like I don't who cares about the stupid non journalist?

117
00:06:37,911 --> 00:06:41,330
Scott: You know, you're not a journalist if you're writing about like douche if using the word douchebag.

118
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:44,610
Scott: Yeah, like if you got using yourself for using the word douchebag.

119
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:51,050
Rym: I feel like if you got the word douchebag in your article, you're probably not a journalist unless you're quoting some douchebag.

120
00:06:51,191 --> 00:06:56,114
Scott: I mean this guy's basically someone who can write a reddit comment, but is instead right, you know It doesn't like.

121
00:06:56,275 --> 00:07:03,084
Scott: I can write a blog post and the only thing that makes it a blog post instead of a comment is where It goes on the page and anyone can make a web page.

122
00:07:03,104 --> 00:07:04,109
Scott: doesn't make you a journalist.

123
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,740
Scott: Who cares about this no-name non journalist guy?

124
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:18,430
Scott: because the only thing that matters is the Smash Brothers Melee tournament rules need to be modified so that you don't get these unsatisfying endings or running out the clock, right?

125
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:22,508
Rym: I think to me I see it as a completely satisfying.

126
00:07:22,588 --> 00:07:28,545
Scott: and well I think another problem here right is that is that affects greater eSports in general right?

127
00:07:28,685 --> 00:07:30,570
Scott: Is that most eSports?

128
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,850
Scott: You cannot modify the game code.

129
00:07:34,173 --> 00:07:41,770
Scott: So if so like something like League of Legends Right or like hearthstone is like the companies that make these things are making like tournament builds and stuff like that.

130
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:52,494
Scott: Yeah, right, but Smash Brothers is like no you're just playing the same Smash Brothers Everyone has at home and there's no way to actually modify the code of the game to make a tournament mode with different rules Or anything else.

131
00:07:52,534 --> 00:07:55,050
Rym: you have to make rules around the game, right?

132
00:07:55,370 --> 00:08:05,590
Scott: You can't modify the code at all and this results is always going to basically guarantee There will be problems in your sport because your rules are completely inflexible.

133
00:08:05,711 --> 00:08:07,490
Scott: You can't change the code of the game or anything.

134
00:08:07,591 --> 00:08:19,690
Scott: But there's also a separate problem that among like the journalism you see about Like even the worst regular sports like baseball which almost never changes the rules changes the rules more And Smash Brothers you can't change the rules.

135
00:08:20,131 --> 00:08:29,020
Rym: But in general with eSports like there's not as much journalism like you'll get some pretty legit journalism about like really big tournaments But anything even.

136
00:08:29,061 --> 00:08:30,369
Rym: I'll tear down from that.

137
00:08:30,972 --> 00:08:45,481
Rym: the only people who show up to cover these things tend to be the some guy with a blog who is Personally invested in the outcome and has very specific personal opinions and doesn't have any Actual like eSports knowledge or expertise, but

138
00:08:45,501 --> 00:08:50,410
Scott: anyway as for this specific instance though They could like like there are like, you know.

139
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:52,218
Scott: I made that general point like oh you should.

140
00:08:52,258 --> 00:08:59,645
Scott: you can't fix the code in case you have problems with the way the game is Coded for tournaments, right but in this particular instance, you don't need to do that.

141
00:08:59,846 --> 00:09:01,170
Scott: It could just play an infinite time.

142
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:01,933
Scott: Why don't they?

143
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:04,925
Rym: yeah like ice hockey like the NHL like there's gonna be a game tonight.

144
00:09:05,026 --> 00:09:10,143
Rym: if they're tied at the end of the Game, they will literally keep playing hockey for ever right?

145
00:09:10,163 --> 00:09:12,330
Scott: You could just you know say infinite time.

146
00:09:12,591 --> 00:09:13,897
Scott: It's five stock no matter what.

147
00:09:13,917 --> 00:09:15,363
Scott: No, wait, go wait.

148
00:09:15,383 --> 00:09:16,829
Scott: We'll sit here and wait for you guys.

149
00:09:17,372 --> 00:09:18,777
Scott: You can't running won't help you.

150
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:19,359
Scott: Yeah.

151
00:09:19,681 --> 00:09:21,909
Scott: Also, why couldn't the guy catch him?

152
00:09:24,613 --> 00:09:25,578
Rym: How did he run at the clock?

153
00:09:25,618 --> 00:09:26,603
Scott: why couldn't he be caught?

154
00:09:26,623 --> 00:09:28,432

155
00:09:28,512 --> 00:09:31,185
Rym: oh look he's just he's just jigglypuffing back and forth.

156
00:09:31,225 --> 00:09:33,305
Scott: I think Hey, hold on.

157
00:09:34,471 --> 00:09:35,617

Scott: Those ice climbers can't like can't hit shit.

173
00:09:57,871 --> 00:09:59,015
Scott: Yeah, why do they suck these?

174
00:09:59,055 --> 00:09:59,698
Scott: not far away?

175
00:09:59,718 --> 00:10:02,207
Scott: It's like he's running far away on the map like in some.

176
00:10:02,248 --> 00:10:02,830
Scott: it's not that.

177
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:04,337
Rym: It's not that Zelda map.

178
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:05,483
Scott: He's right there.

179
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:06,147

Scott: There's a he's just get him.

182
00:10:10,667 --> 00:10:22,495
Rym: There's an Unstated point like about beyond all of this that in general the people in the community around smash brothers anything Pretty toxic and weird.

183
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:27,688
Scott: Well, I mean experience people in a lot and most these kinds of things toxic and weird.

184
00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:31,756
Rym: Yeah You Got any news.

185
00:10:32,627 --> 00:10:32,910
Scott: Oh, yeah.

186
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:39,548
Scott: so there was a contest to make t-shirt designs for Nintendo that I guess Uniqlo would make.

187
00:10:39,588 --> 00:10:45,519
Scott: the shirts and You know Nintendo actually for whatever good or bad they do They're actually pretty good at merch.

188
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:50,863
Scott: if you go to the actual Nintendo store They always got pretty good merch there that like you would not expect them to have.

189
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:56,450
Scott: yeah, like surprisingly high-class stuff It's overpriced and maybe not the best quality construction.

190
00:10:56,972 --> 00:11:00,864
Scott: But the designs are you know, they're better than like we love.

191
00:11:00,905 --> 00:11:02,249
Scott: fine level, right?

192
00:11:02,309 --> 00:11:02,530
Scott: They go.

193
00:11:02,731 --> 00:11:03,395
Scott: Yeah, they get.

194
00:11:03,415 --> 00:11:08,249
Scott: you get like the gold Zelda of cartridge backpack and shit Which if I was a kid would have been the best back.

195
00:11:09,292 --> 00:11:11,522
Scott: But now you won't catch me dead wearing that.

196
00:11:11,602 --> 00:11:13,008
Scott: but it's still a really good design, right?

197
00:11:14,491 --> 00:11:15,334
Scott: But yeah these.

198
00:11:15,596 --> 00:11:24,367
Scott: so there was a contest to submit designs that Uniqlo would make with Nintendo licensed properties and the winners have been selected and I guess soon or now ish it gives.

Scott: They're pretty going.

203
00:11:30,595 --> 00:11:32,470
Scott: they won a contest without a lot of submissions.

204

Scott: Yeah.

208
00:11:41,662 --> 00:11:44,190
Rym: Yeah, I think my other favorite is the.

209
00:11:45,051 --> 00:11:46,658
Rym: This Pokemon shirt is a women's shirt.

210
00:11:46,758 --> 00:11:49,370
Rym: It's just the old fat Pikachu from the gameboy.

211
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,819
Rym: Like as a pattern, it's pretty good.

212
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:52,241
Rym: Mm-hmm.

213
00:11:52,602 --> 00:11:54,210
Rym: Also this boo shirt, which is a bunch of booze.

214
00:11:54,691 --> 00:11:58,041
Scott: Yeah, that thing is like it's got booze on it by wearing that.

215
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:03,697
Scott: it has that weird pattern and then Sleeves don't have the pattern on it situation.

216
00:12:03,717 --> 00:12:05,684
Scott: Yeah, it's a little weird this.

217
00:12:05,904 --> 00:12:07,630
Rym: I'd like I'd like to be able to get this fabric.

218
00:12:07,751 --> 00:12:08,635
Rym: That's just the booze.

219
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:11,128
Scott: I'll make something else that I feel like you could make a good pillow.

220
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:11,410
Scott: All right.

221
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:12,602
Scott: Well, how much is the shirt cost?

222
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:18,052
Scott: Uh, 1500 yen, so probably in America like plus Okay.

223
00:12:18,152 --> 00:12:20,464
Scott: Yeah, so just buy a whole bunch of that shirt.

224
00:12:21,047 --> 00:12:30,968
Scott: Yeah The Biggest size they got extra extra large Did even sell extra extra large Uniqlo, I feel like XL is the biggest size they make.

225
00:12:31,169 --> 00:12:36,078
Rym: yeah I mean luckily a Uniqlo small t-shirt fits me Okay, and a Uniqlo medium fits me like normally.

226
00:12:36,138 --> 00:12:43,029
Rym: so cuz I've gone there before where there was like one large shirt Like hanging out by itself and it's all smalls.

227
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:48,630
Scott: That's all I mean, this is a company that you know, it says like clothes for all but it's closer Japanese people who are small.

228
00:12:49,043 --> 00:12:54,866
Rym: Yeah I'm still sad though because they had those like really heavy jeans many years ago and I bought two pair.

229
00:12:55,248 --> 00:12:57,682
Rym: and now most of the Jeans, they have are not that heavy.

230
00:12:57,823 --> 00:13:04,150
Rym: They're more like Spandex jeans and the normal jeans they have are not quite the same not quite as heavy and I can't get that old heavy jean.

231
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:05,395
Scott: You just go somewhere else.

232
00:13:05,636 --> 00:13:09,050
Rym: Yeah, but the other places I go that have heavy jeans are more mom jean style.

233
00:13:09,812 --> 00:13:12,307
Scott: You can get jeans in many places.

234
00:13:12,328 --> 00:13:18,970
Rym: Yeah From the best jean that that old Uniqlo jean was particularly good and I really liked it.

235
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:19,813
Rym: You can get.

236
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,084
Scott: you just haven't looked how many jean place have you gone to?

237
00:13:22,144 --> 00:13:22,365
Scott: three?

238
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:23,410
Rym: Yeah, I gave up.

239
00:13:23,591 --> 00:13:24,937
Scott: You know how many you're in New York City.

240
00:13:24,957 --> 00:13:26,444
Scott: There's like a hundred different places.

241
00:13:26,464 --> 00:13:29,360
Scott: You can get a different jean Yeah, but I particularly like that one.

242
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:30,950
Rym: Oh, I didn't even notice this one.

243
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:34,924
Rym: It's the pipe instead of the pocket and just Mario and Luigi like peeking out of the pipe.

244
00:13:34,944 --> 00:13:36,610
Rym: That's a real good one, too.

245
00:13:42,261 --> 00:13:45,299
Rym: but anyway things of the day.

246
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:56,051
Rym: So, uh, you might have noticed that the Stanley Cup playoffs are going on right now and the NHL is Expanding again meaning that a lot of good players.

247
00:13:56,091 --> 00:13:57,896
Scott: We need to contract get rid of team.

248
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,040
Scott: Stop making new games.

249
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:05,488
Rym: I'm like, but a lot of good players who are perfectly happy living in great cities It'll be forced to move to Vegas.

250
00:14:05,508 --> 00:14:06,452
Scott: You don't have to move there.

251
00:14:06,492 --> 00:14:08,499
Scott: You just have to work there like half the year.

252
00:14:08,983 --> 00:14:10,438
Rym: Yeah, so you're living there half the year.

253
00:14:11,381 --> 00:14:12,204
Rym: Yeah, that's not.

254
00:14:12,224 --> 00:14:14,955
Scott: I'd have to buy a house there, you know, you can travel constantly.

255
00:14:14,975 --> 00:14:16,220
Scott: yeah, it would be a mad money.

256
00:14:16,262 --> 00:14:16,740
Scott: What do you care?

257
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,067
Rym: It would be really weird to live in Vegas.

258
00:14:19,489 --> 00:14:24,776
Scott: a lot of professional athletes that make enough money don't live Permanently in the place where their team is.

259
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:30,377
Scott: Yeah General and like, you know, they'll live out of a hotel for you know, whatever.

260
00:14:30,398 --> 00:14:36,328
Rym: Yep well, especially if you're gonna get traded or something, but so this video is something the NHL put out.

261
00:14:36,449 --> 00:14:47,921
Rym: I this partly in promotion the fact that there's a new team and it goes through Basically the entire history of the NHL showing all the teams that came and went and changed names and moved around Case.

262
00:14:47,962 --> 00:14:51,534
Rym: it didn't know who the Detroit Falcons were or the Montreal Maroon.

263
00:14:51,574 --> 00:14:52,638
Scott: You don't need to know who they are.

264
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,271
Rym: They're part of history.

265
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:55,080
Scott: Yeah big deal.

266
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:01,898
Rym: I'd like to bring some of those teams back and put them in places that would appreciate hockey rather than get more southern and Western teams and just get rid, you know get rid of like.

267
00:15:02,821 --> 00:15:05,293
Rym: Get rid of the Florida Panthers.

268
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,011
Scott: Yeah, st.

269
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,940
Rym: Louis deserves everything.

270
00:15:11,986 --> 00:15:13,730
Rym: Actually, you know what Nashville like.

271
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:19,266
Rym: if if the Rangers don't win the Stanley Cup pretty much is written for Nashville Yeah, I would like them to win.

272
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:20,410
Scott: Yeah, whatever.

273
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,192
Scott: They're doing pretty.

274
00:15:21,313 --> 00:15:23,620
Scott: anyone that's not Pittsburgh or Washington.

275
00:15:23,942 --> 00:15:25,107
Rym: Yeah, well pretty what.

276
00:15:25,127 --> 00:15:26,534
Rym: no Pennsylvania teams can win.

277
00:15:26,996 --> 00:15:32,280
Rym: really no team No team on the East Coast can win unless it's the Rangers as far as I'm concerned.

278
00:15:33,962 --> 00:15:35,388
Rym: So, uh, this is I don't know.

279
00:15:35,408 --> 00:15:38,580
Rym: this video is overdramatic but it's moderately interesting.

280
00:15:39,802 --> 00:15:54,720
Scott: So here's awesome, dude, Ludacris, you know, excellent Freestyle rap guy, right and he's got the children's book llama llama Red pajama and he's had some morning radio show somewhere.

281
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:01,900
Rym: The first YouTube comment actually describes literally everything that needs to be described about this.

282
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,644
Rym: Not gonna lie.

283
00:16:02,685 --> 00:16:04,315
Rym: This is actually fire emoticon.

284
00:16:04,476 --> 00:16:04,999
Scott: That's right.

285
00:16:06,241 --> 00:16:07,305
Scott: So yeah, I mean, you know, it's.

286
00:16:07,546 --> 00:16:07,667
Scott: it's.

287
00:16:07,687 --> 00:16:12,605
Scott: you take someone with you know, amazing talent and you have them Perform something.

288
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:18,907
Scott: that's not what they usually perform and you can see how you know The combination of the two art forms.

289
00:16:19,388 --> 00:16:21,275
Scott: right create some sort of magic, right?

290
00:16:21,295 --> 00:16:24,520
Scott: It's like a few weeks ago There was a something going around.

291
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:47,720
Scott: Basically a cat got on a field somewhere at some sporting event and all the sports photographers took pictures of the cat And you could see the combination of the art of sports photography and cat Which is not a combination that usually happens right and it's like oh and it helps you, you know understand You know both art forms better right you understand cat more and you understand.

292
00:16:48,282 --> 00:16:53,340
Scott: You know the sports photography more when you see them and used in a different context than they normally appear.

293
00:16:53,420 --> 00:17:01,319
Scott: So here you can understand freestyle rap and children's book writing more By seeing them combined in a new context.

294
00:17:02,281 --> 00:17:05,839
Rym: So I got a third mini thing of the day because it's related to hockey.

295
00:17:05,981 --> 00:17:09,079
Rym: I just stumbled upon this cuz I've spent a lot more time in the hockey reddits.

296
00:17:09,201 --> 00:17:16,619
Rym: just I do that every year around Stanley Cup time and If a lot of you especially, you know, this is Tuesday like GeekNights gaming night.

297
00:17:16,981 --> 00:17:22,980
Rym: So we sports count and all that and I know a lot of nerds very popularly like to pointedly hate on sports.

298
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,288
Rym: But sports people are just as nerdy as you.

299
00:17:26,308 --> 00:17:35,457
Rym: and if you want an example of this like this is a like a hockey meme About a particular hockey player that is in the style of your weird internet meme nonsense.

300
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:36,160
Scott: Okay?

301
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,448
Rym: Also, it's Tanner glass my man.

302
00:17:38,468 --> 00:17:40,058
Rym: Those girls were at the game.

303
00:17:40,078 --> 00:17:40,319
Rym: Just this.

304
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:48,220
Rym: I Wonder what their deal was like, how did they move into the Tanner glass specific fandom?

305
00:17:49,801 --> 00:17:52,353
Rym: In the meta moment the booklet book is Frank Herbert's Dune.

306
00:17:52,694 --> 00:17:53,980
Rym: I beat the fourth divine beasts.

307
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:56,313
Rym: So I'm getting closer to actually reading this book.

308
00:17:56,434 --> 00:18:00,740
Scott: I haven't played a Zelda Still I haven't even gone to Goron land at all.

309
00:18:00,961 --> 00:18:05,320
Scott: I gotta tell you I'm going around getting shrines and doing that kind of stuff, but I haven't done it in a while.

310
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,947
Rym: I got a lot of shrines.

311
00:18:07,007 --> 00:18:08,153
Rym: I found a bunch of shrines.

312
00:18:08,474 --> 00:18:09,740
Rym: I didn't do most of the shrine quest.

313
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:14,880
Rym: I actually found most of the shrines just by like dinking around in my own out in the wilderness.

314
00:18:15,162 --> 00:18:21,940
Rym: Yeah, you know, but I gotta say the Goron quest I saved it for last cuz I felt like Death Mountain would be the craziest one.

315
00:18:22,767 --> 00:18:24,179
Rym: It is the least fun one.

316
00:18:24,662 --> 00:18:35,439
Rym: It is the easiest one not just because I'm like super powerful and have like strong stuff now But just because like the puzzles in Goron land like I beat the whole thing in a couple minutes like no

317
00:18:35,941 --> 00:18:42,140
Scott: I only saved Goron land for last because I would need some sort of heat protecting gear to go in there where it's all firing.

318
00:18:42,441 --> 00:18:45,070
Rym: Yeah, except you know where you get the heat protecting gear on the way in.

319
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:48,240
Rym: no all the way in in Goron town.

320
00:18:48,525 --> 00:18:51,162
Scott: Oh, okay Protecting gear.

321
00:18:51,182 --> 00:18:52,025
Scott: I got in the desert land.

322
00:18:52,587 --> 00:18:53,108
Rym: That's not.

323
00:18:53,169 --> 00:18:54,674
Rym: no no you do not have that gear.

324
00:18:54,915 --> 00:18:56,480
Rym: you have heat protecting gear.

325
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,166
Rym: You do not have fire protecting gear.

326
00:18:58,407 --> 00:19:00,795
Scott: I don't need fire protecting gear until I actually go in fire.

327
00:19:00,816 --> 00:19:13,900
Rym: Uh If the air is so hot that everything catches fire in the open air once you get too close to death mountain Mmm, like you try to fly in and suddenly you're on fire and no amount of heat protection protects you from that.

328
00:19:14,623 --> 00:19:20,628
Rym: and I got to a point where I needed multiple layers of Fire protection independent of heat protection.

329
00:19:20,648 --> 00:19:21,691
Rym: They're two different things.

330
00:19:21,992 --> 00:19:23,597
Rym: Okay, there's also difference between.

331
00:19:23,637 --> 00:19:26,388
Scott: I'm sure I can just eat a food That takes care of it.

332
00:19:26,408 --> 00:19:27,795
Rym: There's only an elixir that does it.

333
00:19:27,815 --> 00:19:28,719
Rym: There's no food that does it.

334
00:19:28,921 --> 00:19:30,650
Scott: I'll make it I'll make the elixir and before you

335
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:44,400
Rym: know what I did I said fuck it I just ate a bunch of health and I ran all the way to Goron land eating health because when you're in there while you're Literally on fire if you talk to anyone the game resets your fire status and you catch fire again in a few seconds.

336
00:19:44,701 --> 00:19:50,100
Rym: If you keep talking to NPCs you can kind of like eventually find the one that gives you fireproof armor.

337
00:19:50,482 --> 00:19:52,816
Rym: Yeah, and you can spend money and buy that armor.

338
00:19:52,897 --> 00:19:53,380
Rym: then you're okay.

339
00:19:53,602 --> 00:19:55,540
Scott: I should have a bunch of money before I tried to go there.

340
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,567
Scott: Yeah, see that's the only reason I saved that one for last.

341
00:19:57,948 --> 00:20:07,460
Rym: but it's just really boring like the quest to get to you know Every they're like every beast has like fly around and shoot arrows at it or like blow up the feed and there's lightning.

342
00:20:07,721 --> 00:20:15,339
Rym: Yeah, this one is a stealth mission, but it's really janky and poorly done Like everything about the Goron quest is just the stealth mission in the.

343
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:19,578
Scott: The other stealth mission with the banana people was also bad.

344
00:20:19,879 --> 00:20:21,747
Rym: Yeah Well, the banana people one was not.

345
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:26,567
Rym: it wasn't that bad, but I just snuck up on everyone and murdered him one by one Mmm, I literally threw banana out.

346
00:20:26,628 --> 00:20:28,194
Rym: guy walked over and ate it stabbed her in the back.

347
00:20:28,495 --> 00:20:29,740
Rym: repeat until they were all dead.

348
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,573
Scott: Those guys when I fought those guys, they did not go down in one hit.

349
00:20:32,674 --> 00:20:33,056
Scott: I need him.

350
00:20:33,116 --> 00:20:33,980
Scott: They were very dangerous.

351
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:34,782
Rym: Did you sneak him?

352
00:20:34,802 --> 00:20:37,209
Rym: because if you get a sneak strike, it's one shot.

353
00:20:38,633 --> 00:20:47,000
Rym: I See you and you get close enough to him and option appears on the screen like hit wide a sneak strike.

354
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:47,361
Rym: I've never.

355
00:20:47,422 --> 00:20:48,446
Scott: I've never seen that ever.

356
00:20:48,627 --> 00:20:50,314
Rym: Whoa sneak up on sleeping guys sky.

357
00:20:50,334 --> 00:20:50,957
Rym: You get a one-shot.

358
00:20:50,977 --> 00:20:51,660
Rym: pretty much anyone.

359
00:20:51,962 --> 00:20:53,615
Rym: Okay, except like guardians.

360
00:20:53,635 --> 00:20:54,280
Rym: You can't do this too.

361
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,942
Rym: But like sneak up and even like those white Moblins and get a sneak strike instant death All right.

362
00:21:00,404 --> 00:21:02,172
Rym: Now, I don't think you can do it.

363
00:21:02,232 --> 00:21:04,020
Scott: I saw upgrade myself suit all the way.

364
00:21:04,442 --> 00:21:07,840
Rym: I don't even I just sneak up super slow maybe eating a little bit of stealth food.

365
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,156
Rym: I didn't even bother buying the stealth clothing.

366
00:21:10,176 --> 00:21:30,360
Rym: Mmm Not only is the Goron Sneak up dumb and you can just skip it by killing the things that are flying around trying to see you And even when they see you like it's not much of a puzzle It's just sort of brute force, you know, like whistle to tell him to stop or start moving But if you get even a little bit far away from him, he can't hear your whistle.

367
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:33,575
Rym: So it doesn't even really work and it was just really disappointing.

368
00:21:33,896 --> 00:21:44,120
Rym: from start to finish I beat the whole thing in one go and if you have not gonna divine beast yet I urge you to do the Goron one first because I think that's the only way to make it even remotely interesting.

369
00:21:44,622 --> 00:21:48,540
Scott: Um, plus I'm gonna do some castling before I go and you know get the last divine.

370
00:21:48,621 --> 00:21:51,720
Scott: I heard that if you go to the castle before doing all the divine beasts is different.

371
00:21:52,301 --> 00:21:56,660
Scott: So I want to do some a bunch more castling stuff before I get clear the last divine.

372
00:21:57,226 --> 00:22:01,440
Rym: I didn't know that cuz I cleared all the beasts I've been in the castle a little bit, but I kept getting scared and leaving.

373
00:22:01,581 --> 00:22:03,473
Scott: I heard that this you know different castle stuff.

374
00:22:03,534 --> 00:22:06,411
Scott: if you got different, you know You know, you don't get you have all the beasts or not.

375
00:22:06,552 --> 00:22:08,040
Rym: I found all the memories on my own.

376
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,224
Rym: I didn't even use the painter guy.

377
00:22:09,304 --> 00:22:10,328
Scott: I think I'm missing a couple.

378
00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:11,573
Rym: I'm missing two.

379
00:22:12,255 --> 00:22:13,660
Rym: One of them looks like it's the castle.

380
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:20,594
Rym: Yeah, I need the castle one and one of them looks like a grotto with like some stuff Yeah, and I can't find that one either.

381
00:22:20,614 --> 00:22:24,374
Rym: Mm-hmm Maybe I'll try to find the painter guy and see if it'll point me in the right direction.

382
00:22:24,494 --> 00:22:28,292
Rym: right - it's black, too Yeah, so otherwise, I don't know.

383
00:22:28,553 --> 00:22:30,020
Rym: follow us on YouTube.

384
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:40,227
Rym: it's both Scott's channel and my channel because we had good stuff going on and July so we got nothing for a while.

385
00:22:40,247 --> 00:22:43,679
Scott: to be honest with you ConnectiCon looking not as good as previous ConnectiCon.

386
00:22:43,921 --> 00:22:44,813
Rym: Oh, so why do you say that?

387
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,608
Scott: Let's see a lot less enthusiasm from the people.

388
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:51,859
Rym: which people all the people I mean all our friends who have been so.

389
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:57,240
Rym: most of The FRC over time has decided to bail on all the concept of conventions.

390
00:22:57,622 --> 00:22:59,010
Rym: They basically like.

391
00:22:59,512 --> 00:23:10,620
Rym: they go to cons and they like them but as soon as they encounter any amount of difficulty or resistance at all, like PAX East as soon as Badges sold out within a couple days Not even now and it's like instant.

392
00:23:11,122 --> 00:23:14,774
Rym: They all bailed 100% and they only go to mag fest because they can buy badges now.

393
00:23:14,794 --> 00:23:15,376
Rym: worry about it.

394
00:23:15,797 --> 00:23:17,042
Rym: now that mag fest is Selling out.

395
00:23:17,122 --> 00:23:19,092
Rym: I'll bet a lot of them start bailing on mag fest.

396
00:23:19,293 --> 00:23:19,614
Scott: We'll see.

397
00:23:19,634 --> 00:23:24,319
Rym: Ah I think PAX Unplugged is they're all going to PAX Unplugged now.

398
00:23:24,801 --> 00:23:27,027
Scott: And I think this is all going to PAX Unplugged.

399
00:23:27,067 --> 00:23:28,712
Scott: I haven't heard anyone except the hardcore.

400
00:23:28,732 --> 00:23:29,594
Rym: Go Joe's going.

401
00:23:29,735 --> 00:23:30,858
Rym: George is going.

402
00:23:30,898 --> 00:23:31,660
Rym: people are going.

403
00:23:31,801 --> 00:23:32,871
Scott: It's not everyone.

404
00:23:32,992 --> 00:23:33,900
Rym: I think a lot of a lot.

405
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:38,699
Rym: I think of why a subset of everyone that is a majority is going to go to PAX Unplugged.

406
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,690
Rym: But I think starting next year.

407
00:23:42,112 --> 00:23:44,040
Rym: Most of them will bail when it starts selling out.

408
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:46,239
Rym: I might still not sell out for two years.

409
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,990
Scott: I don't think PAX Unplugged is gonna sell.

410
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:53,000
Rym: even pecs out isn't really selling out Yeah, but pecs out is also far away from population centers.

411
00:23:53,582 --> 00:23:53,963
Scott: We'll see.

412
00:23:53,983 --> 00:23:59,139
Rym: Uh, I mean, I think 20 million people can take a short train ride to get to PAX Unplugged.

413
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:15,060
Rym: The problem with PAX Unplugged is solely that pretty much 99% of anyone I talked to who is really into tabletop Has never heard of PAX Unplugged and a lot of them have never even heard of a pecs in general.

414
00:24:15,683 --> 00:24:19,380
Rym: So there's still that barrier of just people don't know things about things.

415
00:24:19,821 --> 00:24:24,660
Rym: But even like pecs people don't seem to know that PAX Unplugged not only is happening but like is this year.

416
00:24:25,546 --> 00:24:30,167
Rym: I don't know what they can do about that Like advertise or something like.

417
00:24:30,207 --> 00:24:31,853
Rym: I don't know if pecs is ever advertised.

418
00:24:32,114 --> 00:24:32,575
Scott: No, never.

419
00:24:32,676 --> 00:24:33,900
Rym: I've never seen an ad for pecs.

420
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,940
Scott: I think they put local ads like, you know, the things on the street lights and shit.

421
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:43,026
Rym: yeah, but I will be a PAX Unplugged doing a bunch of stuff and pecs prime and PAX West.

422
00:24:43,067 --> 00:24:48,002
Rym: I'm actually planning my PAX West or my pecs Australia trip currently Cuz.

423
00:24:48,022 --> 00:24:51,680
Rym: I'm gonna go to go to a thing in Sydney and then I'm gonna go to pecs the next weekend in Melbourne.

424
00:24:52,905 --> 00:24:53,333
Rym: You gonna come?

425
00:24:54,192 --> 00:25:04,321
Rym: Hmm So Mario Kart I actually skipped because I didn't buy a Wii U Wii U Wii U. I never had Mario Kart 8.

426
00:25:04,321 --> 00:25:07,535
Rym: I've only ever played Mario Kart 8 at other people's houses.

427
00:25:07,555 --> 00:25:13,691
Rym: the Mario Kart I have played the most in my entire life is Probably still the one on the 3ds cuz.

428
00:25:13,731 --> 00:25:14,776
Rym: I played the ever-living hell.

429
00:25:14,836 --> 00:25:21,271
Scott: out of that Mario Kart I played the most in my whole life is Mario Kart Super Circuit for the GBA.

430
00:25:21,352 --> 00:25:27,640
Scott: the best Mario Kart there ever was and still Probably gonna ever be is I mean it was good for its era.

431
00:25:27,881 --> 00:25:31,532
Rym: I really liked the regular DS one until it was broken.

432
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:33,900
Scott: Well, this is a Super Circuit Mario Kart, right?

433
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:39,740
Scott: I've said this before but I'm gonna say it again It's not better because it's got like the most of the best courses or the most characters.

434
00:25:39,921 --> 00:25:44,360
Scott: It's like it's lacking and like all of these areas that you would usually judge a Mario Kart.

435
00:25:44,842 --> 00:25:52,888
Scott: The only thing that makes it the best Mario Kart is the most important thing which is that it is 100% skill based racing.

436
00:25:53,209 --> 00:25:56,120
Scott: Yes, it still has items like the blue shell.

437
00:25:56,621 --> 00:26:06,019
Scott: However in Mario Kart Super Circuit if you drive fucking perfectly like you don't touch a wall even a little bit I feel like you've said these exact words.

438
00:26:06,181 --> 00:26:07,069
Rym: episodes of geek now.

439
00:26:08,402 --> 00:26:27,020
Scott: Yes If you don't even let go of a for a fraction of a second the accelerate button if you drift perfectly around every single turn always getting blue sparks if you do all of these things in this game and Blue shell is on your ass that blue shell will remain on your ass without actually touching you.

440
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:31,749
Scott: And if you continue for a long enough time Eventually, the blue shell will be like this guy's too good.

441
00:26:31,809 --> 00:26:34,900
Scott: Fuck it and just give up on you until another blue shell gets fired.

442
00:26:35,081 --> 00:26:43,277
Scott: yeah, right and that makes it a Skill based racing game yet still has the fun of the items and whatnot, right?

443
00:26:43,298 --> 00:26:45,306
Scott: So You know all.

444
00:26:45,406 --> 00:26:49,383
Rym: there's a lot of modern ones like you can just say like shells only and stuff Hold on.

445
00:26:49,423 --> 00:26:55,180
Scott: so in Super Nintendo Mario Kart, it just you know, it's the controls are kind of if you play it now, right?

446
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,359
Scott: It's not it's got problems.

447
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,897
Rym: Yeah Like f-zero on the SNES is a way better racing game.

448
00:27:00,958 --> 00:27:07,460
Scott: Mario Kart 64 has a lot of problems like rubber banding and glitches and messed up maps and all good.

449
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:10,192
Scott: It's this the jankiest of all the Mario Karts, right?

450
00:27:10,655 --> 00:27:14,110
Scott: the DS 1 Snakey-snakey big problem.

451
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:18,871
Scott: Yes without without snakey great It was great, but it did have the.

452
00:27:19,293 --> 00:27:20,860
Scott: it lacks the perfect skill, right?

453
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,594
Scott: The blue shell will still just hit you no matter what pretty much right?

454
00:27:23,634 --> 00:27:31,235
Rym: Yeah, but at the same time If you were good I could be so far ahead even against like real legit people that the blue shell didn't matter.

455
00:27:31,376 --> 00:27:33,342
Scott: and can I go far ahead without snaking?

456
00:27:33,703 --> 00:27:43,220
Rym: well play to win the game, but that was also the game that probably had the Tightest ghost community of going after those ghosts, right?

457
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:55,796
Scott: But anyway, the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is actually the Wii U Mario Kart re-released on the switch except a. Everything's unlocked in terms of characters and maps right from the beginning.

458
00:27:55,836 --> 00:28:00,720
Scott: Yeah, unlike any of that shit The only thing that's not unlocked is a bunch of hats and nonsense is carrot is car parts.

459
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:03,639
Scott: So it's like and you get the car parts just by getting coins.

460
00:28:05,005 --> 00:28:11,160
Scott: So if you just play the game a bunch You're just gonna unlock those things as you go and it's like you'd be surprised how fast you unlock.

461
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:11,260
Scott: shit.

462
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,988
Scott: It's like every other race.

463
00:28:13,008 --> 00:28:15,740
Scott: We're getting we're unlocking something because it's only a hundred coins.

464
00:28:16,182 --> 00:28:19,560
Scott: So in a particular in one race, you're gonna go three laps.

465
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:26,860
Scott: You're gonna get like maybe up to 30 coins per one person if you get two people racing like 60 coins in one race.

466
00:28:27,101 --> 00:28:32,860
Scott: Yeah, like you get I'm already like thousands and thousands of coins collected with tons and tons of stuff unlocked.

467
00:28:33,121 --> 00:28:33,804
Scott: I don't even care.

468
00:28:33,824 --> 00:28:36,173
Rym: I played maybe an hour of this game total.

469
00:28:36,394 --> 00:28:37,840
Scott: So yeah, it's not me, right?

470
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:41,108
Scott: So this I think Mario Kart 8 Deluxe I don't.

471
00:28:41,148 --> 00:28:48,920
Scott: I never played Mario Kart 8 So I don't know too much of the other differences besides the fact that everything's and it feels pretty much the same, right?

472
00:28:49,300 --> 00:29:00,455
Scott: But I can tell you that of all the Mario Kart's I've played Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is the second best Mario Kart and this is why Even though first of all tons and tons of maps you got 12 times 4.

473
00:29:00,455 --> 00:29:06,748
Scott: I think it's 48 maps No 12 times 4 12. yeah, 48 maps.

474
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:08,334
Scott: That's a lot of maps, right?

475
00:29:08,675 --> 00:29:09,840
Scott: You got a bunch of battle modes.

476
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,660
Scott: We'll talk about those later, but at least I mean they're there.

477
00:29:12,761 --> 00:29:15,640
Scott: So I guess it's better than them not being there no matter how bad they are.

478
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:18,920
Rym: I'd pretty much rather them not be there because I think they've always been terrible.

479
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:19,823
Rym: I have this.

480
00:29:19,903 --> 00:29:20,725
Rym: more is better.

481
00:29:20,806 --> 00:29:22,250
Scott: even you know more is never less.

482
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:31,276
Rym: So I think most battle modes in games like this Existed solely because there was an error where people had like Super Nintendo or an n64 or something.

483
00:29:33,061 --> 00:29:38,978
Rym: but the vast majority of gamers did not have gaming computers and internet to be able to play.

484
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:45,819
Rym: like Modern FPS is online because there were just like real badly games online with computers people.

485
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:52,239
Scott: really I don't think Mario Kart battle mode exists because FPS is we're on PC, but people really wanted to play in general.

486
00:29:52,279 --> 00:30:00,080
Scott: like No connection between FPS is being better on PCs and Mario Kart battle mode.

487
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:19,040
Rym: Here's something I noticed of all my friends from my entire childhood the only people who ever ever played battle mode in Mario karts and professed to enjoy it were the same people who played a lot of 007 and professed to enjoy it and none of them owned a gaming PC at any point in my childhood.

488
00:30:19,381 --> 00:30:23,034
Rym: Anyone who had a gaming PC and internet never played any of this nonsense.

489
00:30:23,215 --> 00:30:24,760
Scott: Anyway, we'll talk about battle mode later, right?

490
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,182
Scott: They're there.

491
00:30:25,202 --> 00:30:25,705
Scott: They're there.

492
00:30:25,926 --> 00:30:26,369
Scott: They're there.

493
00:30:26,429 --> 00:30:26,932
Scott: They're there.

494
00:30:26,952 --> 00:30:29,929
Scott: All right How many characters.

495
00:30:29,969 --> 00:30:31,980
Scott: I can't even count the characters this so fucking many.

496
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:32,983
Scott: There's a lot.

497
00:30:33,525 --> 00:30:38,040
Scott: any character you want is gonna be one there and they are all for the most part different.

498
00:30:38,363 --> 00:30:42,766
Scott: So yeah, great King boo, though cannot take.

499
00:30:42,847 --> 00:30:46,480
Rym: I have not even tried to check if there's a Pareto frontier here or not.

500
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,403
Scott: It might be Bowser.

501
00:30:47,423 --> 00:30:54,203
Scott: I think right and this has so in this in just even in the non battle modes You got your 50 CC.

502
00:30:54,243 --> 00:30:54,746
Scott: Yeah, 100 CC.

503
00:30:55,148 --> 00:30:55,992
Scott: Yeah, you're 150 CC.

504
00:30:58,243 --> 00:31:15,594
Scott: You got your mirror mode, which is 150 CC But all the maps got flipped backwards and you got I think this might not be in Mario Kart 8 200 CC Did it doesn't matter you still have 200 CC Whether it's new or not.

505
00:31:15,695 --> 00:31:16,100
Scott: It's there.

506
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:19,934
Rym: So the only difference between 150 and 200 is you can you have to break in 200 200 is lit.

507
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,316
Scott: That's like the real deal is my you know it.

508
00:31:23,316 --> 00:31:27,714
Scott: 200 if you didn't have items would be f-zero just with a different skin on it.

509
00:31:27,774 --> 00:31:31,199
Scott: Really when you think about it There's even an f-zero map in this game.

510
00:31:31,642 --> 00:31:34,960
Scott: Some people are actually questioning whether you can still call the game Mario Kart.

511
00:31:35,342 --> 00:31:42,749
Scott: They posted a screenshot of like a splatoon character driving like You know some car.

512
00:31:42,769 --> 00:31:51,020
Scott: that's not a Mario car On a Zelda map and it's like there's not Mario anywhere on the screen at all.

513
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,826
Scott: Why is this Mario Kart?

514
00:31:52,866 --> 00:31:57,080
Scott: Mario Kart is because well no matter what you still have like mushroom and turtle shells your items, right?

515
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:09,540
Rym: Now it's interesting that probably that the the thing that a lot of you probably don't realize Unless you've read about this game You probably wouldn't notice it even if you own it and played it a lot is that by default it has auto-aim.

516
00:32:10,083 --> 00:32:12,699
Scott: Alright, so you have to really pay attention to this.

517
00:32:13,161 --> 00:32:19,502
Scott: There's three options that you can choose when you're playing and it lets you choose them on a player by player basis Which is good.

518
00:32:20,044 --> 00:32:21,530
Scott: Option one is auto-steer.

519
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:24,120
Scott: Now auto-steer is good that it's there.

520
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,340
Scott: I think it's bad that it's on by default, but it's good that it's there, right?

521
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:33,500
Scott: And this is because let's say you're playing with someone who sucks ass or a child or a child or someone who?

522
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,849
Scott: has disability or who knows what right.

523
00:32:36,292 --> 00:32:50,751
Scott: you can just freaking hold a and you it'll turn for you so you can just pay attention to like the item shooting and Not have to worry about steering and staying on the track so much and you can basically get all the fun of the fun parts of Mario Kart.

524
00:32:51,153 --> 00:32:55,828
Scott: and your lack of skill won't cause you to like Cry because you're falling off the track constantly.

525
00:32:55,909 --> 00:32:56,109
Rym: Yep.

526
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:59,060
Scott: However, you get punished for choosing this option.

527
00:32:59,200 --> 00:32:59,823
Scott: You won't beat.

528
00:32:59,883 --> 00:33:04,160
Scott: people are actually good at Mario Kart because a you will not allow you to take shortcuts.

529
00:33:04,421 --> 00:33:08,996
Scott: Like if you try to go towards a shortcut, it's like new it's like no that's going off the track.

530
00:33:09,056 --> 00:33:11,342
Scott: And that's how I Figured out.

531
00:33:11,402 --> 00:33:13,430
Scott: I didn't realize this option was there to begin with.

532
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:16,724
Scott: I figured it out because like how come I can't go on this Fucking shortcuts.

533
00:33:16,764 --> 00:33:17,751
Scott: I was going straight at it.

534
00:33:17,791 --> 00:33:18,516
Scott: How did this happen?

535
00:33:18,556 --> 00:33:30,400
Rym: Oh my god I found out because someone tweeted explaining it and then I found some reddits where all these people were like Mario Kart broken and they didn't understand why and they didn't know this option existed.

536
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:35,220
Scott: Yeah, but anyway, so you want to turn this off for real Mario Kart, but it's good that it exists.

537
00:33:35,361 --> 00:33:37,815
Scott: I just don't think it should be on by default, but that doesn't matter so much.

538
00:33:37,956 --> 00:33:42,648
Scott: option to motion controls Instead of regular stick control.

539
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:46,680
Rym: theoretically they could be better than they've been on any Nintendo console to date.

540
00:33:46,901 --> 00:33:48,888
Scott: I have heard a rumor.

541
00:33:49,089 --> 00:33:50,795
Scott: I'm not sure how what the details are.

542
00:33:50,815 --> 00:33:52,040
Scott: I think it's still being investigated.

543
00:33:52,140 --> 00:34:01,820
Scott: I haven't seen like absolute confirmation that if you choose motion controls you have 100 it overrides your car stats and gives you perfect traction.

544
00:34:02,363 --> 00:34:05,580
Scott: Why to make up for your use of motion control if that's true?

545
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:14,920
Scott: I've also heard a rumor that you could choose motion control and still steer with the stick And I guess you as long as you keep perfectly still you won't fuck yourself up with the motion control.

546
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,963
Rym: So I gotta get a vice to mount the pro controller in Right.

547
00:34:19,003 --> 00:34:26,991
Scott: So you would choose a car lay set up that is really low traction and really high other things Yeah, and then choose motion control to get perfect traction.

548
00:34:27,071 --> 00:34:28,757
Scott: If this is true, we don't know yet.

549
00:34:28,777 --> 00:34:32,980
Rym: We're still Already now into the mode of spreading rumors, right?

550
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:41,918
Scott: Okay, but you can choose to either use motion controls or not Which is fun because you can get that car steering action going on right which is fun for certain people But it's off by default, which is good.

551
00:34:42,641 --> 00:34:47,235
Scott: Option three and this is one that's the most debated auto accelerate.

552
00:34:47,315 --> 00:34:51,699
Scott: if you choose this option Basically, the game will just hold a for you the whole time.

553
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,840
Rym: You don't have to hold a which I generally hold a almost all the time, right?

554
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,629
Scott: But it's like when do I not want to hold a?

555
00:34:58,810 --> 00:34:59,633
Scott: almost never.

556
00:34:59,693 --> 00:35:00,456
Scott: so it's like oh, it's just.

557
00:35:00,797 --> 00:35:01,700
Scott: is that really bad?

558
00:35:02,262 --> 00:35:13,878
Scott: We don't know if there's any downside to picking this but it's like people both, you know on the side of you know Not high skilled people just you know, wanting to make the game easier and more fun can choose this option.

559
00:35:13,938 --> 00:35:14,400
Scott: just fine.

560
00:35:14,882 --> 00:35:19,747
Scott: But also pro people are like trying this option be like hey Why should I sit there holding the a button?

561
00:35:19,767 --> 00:35:26,291
Scott: I can occupy my finger like just using the brake and not Worrying about the item button at all the accelerate button at all.

562
00:35:26,311 --> 00:35:28,900
Scott: Yeah, right and it's like that's kind of good, right?

563
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,988
Scott: What's the downside of this auto accelerate?

564
00:35:31,048 --> 00:35:32,293
Scott: why not put it on?

565
00:35:32,313 --> 00:35:43,640
Rym: so the way I typically play cuz I you know I played mostly the 3ds one, but you know when I'm going for ghosts or anything I will often let go of a and kind of feather it on certain corners, but I never touch the brake.

566
00:35:44,102 --> 00:35:45,808
Rym: This might cause 200 CC.

567
00:35:45,828 --> 00:35:47,073
Scott: You gotta use water CC.

568
00:35:47,133 --> 00:35:48,297
Rym: I'm feathering the brake.

569
00:35:48,578 --> 00:36:00,876
Scott: Yeah But anyway, so yeah this this third option of auto accelerate deserves some amount of experimentation and investigation To see whether like if you just get used to not holding a like that could actually be an improvement.

570
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:09,400
Scott: if there's no hidden downside Like, you know if the hidden downside of the the auto steering is you can't take shortcuts and you can't get Pink's boost.

571
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:12,050
Scott: You can only get you know, blue sparks and orange sparks.

572
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:20,139
Rym: You can't get the third level of drip boost sparks Yeah, and if you try to like doesn't really really tight drift, it'll push you away from.

573
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:27,442
Scott: yeah But there's no there's seemingly no downside from the auto accelerate yet that we know of Okay.

574
00:36:27,462 --> 00:36:29,350
Scott: So the other thing in this game is the items.

575
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:30,134
Scott: There's a few items.

576
00:36:30,174 --> 00:36:31,701
Scott: I haven't seen before in Mario Kart There's.

577
00:36:31,721 --> 00:36:33,089
Rym: you haven't played modern Mario Kart.

578
00:36:33,129 --> 00:36:35,541
Scott: There's a boomerang which is like whatever It's.

579
00:36:35,682 --> 00:36:37,589
Scott: it's an item you get when you're in the middle of the pack.

580
00:36:37,609 --> 00:36:39,958
Scott: That's like a reusable green shell kind of.

581
00:36:39,999 --> 00:36:41,619
Scott: I guess It's real dangerous.

582
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:47,159
Scott: There's a. there's a the piranha plant which is you can eat other people to hurt them.

583
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,312
Scott: Yeah, but it also you keep jamming a and it.

584
00:36:49,372 --> 00:36:52,812
Scott: except you keep jamming the item button It accelerates you a little bit when it lunges forward.

585
00:36:53,275 --> 00:36:54,120
Scott: That's an okay item.

586
00:36:55,281 --> 00:37:02,464
Scott: The biggest difference that I see that I really like is that if you're away at the front and you're gonna get blue shelled Obviously the game gives you shit.

587
00:37:02,584 --> 00:37:03,507
Scott: items like coin.

588
00:37:03,607 --> 00:37:06,035
Scott: Yeah green shell banana peel.

589
00:37:06,356 --> 00:37:07,479
Scott: That's pretty much it, right?

590
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:20,440
Scott: But it also will occasionally give you this Oh horn it's like Bob right and it basically is like a AoE effect that originates on you and only goes in a very small radius.

591
00:37:20,962 --> 00:37:23,471
Scott: Right, it's basically the radius of a blue shell explosion.

592
00:37:23,972 --> 00:37:27,149
Scott: and what it does is it messes up other drivers But you're in first place.

593
00:37:27,189 --> 00:37:28,399
Scott: That's useless, right?

594
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:32,069
Scott: But it can also destroy items that are about to hit you.

595
00:37:32,471 --> 00:37:35,260
Scott: and I like this because let's say a blue shell is coming.

596
00:37:35,963 --> 00:37:42,380
Scott: If you've got the horn you've been saving it and you use it with perfect timing You can actually destroy the blue shell and defend yourself.

597
00:37:42,481 --> 00:37:44,840
Rym: But that means you've got to have the luck of having gotten the horn.

598
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,849
Scott: You got to have the horn.

599
00:37:45,869 --> 00:37:48,439
Scott: you have to not lose the horn But to like a lightning or something.

600
00:37:48,861 --> 00:37:53,780
Scott: You have to have the horn when the blue shell is coming and use it with precision skill at the right time.

601
00:37:54,442 --> 00:37:59,200
Scott: Also, you can hold shells and banana peels behind you to block shots that are coming up on you.

602
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:04,500
Scott: So it's not as good a super circuit where just perfect driving is enough to guarantee that you're safe.

603
00:38:05,022 --> 00:38:06,288
Scott: But you can.

604
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,840
Scott: you know, if you're driving you're getting a ton of items.

605
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,469
Scott: You can also get like double items for these double question blocks.

606
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:14,800
Scott: So you're gonna have enough items to defend yourself.

607
00:38:15,161 --> 00:38:19,800
Scott: So with enough skill you are going to win the vast majority of Mario Kart races.

608
00:38:20,901 --> 00:38:22,545
Scott: You don't really have to worry too much about getting.

609
00:38:23,127 --> 00:38:28,885
Scott: you're gonna occasionally get blasted by like blue shell lightning bolt red shell Right at the finish line.

610
00:38:28,925 --> 00:38:29,910
Scott: Yeah, but I've been.

611
00:38:30,031 --> 00:38:31,740
Scott: I played a lot of Mario Kart so far.

612
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:37,078
Scott: I played all the 50 cc's got gold cups all the 100 cc's got gold cups and I'm working on the 150s.

613
00:38:37,098 --> 00:38:46,126
Scott: now I'm getting gold cups still and that bullshit at the like end of race multiple item hit has only happened One time in all those races.

614
00:38:46,426 --> 00:38:50,619
Scott: because so I've been able to defend myself right and prevent a lot of that going on.

615
00:38:51,282 --> 00:38:54,920
Rym: So in terms of the items student for the randomness the options are a little bit changed.

616
00:38:55,001 --> 00:38:56,779
Rym: I found a list of all the changes between the games.

617
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:06,550
Rym: But when you choose the set of options to use in multiplayer you have options like frantic items Yeah, or more very important skilled items.

618
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,916
Rym: Yeah, I do say skill items only.

619
00:39:09,036 --> 00:39:11,046
Scott: I do like the multiplayer.

620
00:39:11,187 --> 00:39:15,447
Scott: really lets you customize Exactly what's gonna be used or not used.

621
00:39:15,487 --> 00:39:16,872
Scott: right, you know, you know.

622
00:39:16,952 --> 00:39:18,337
Scott: CPUs no CPUs.

623
00:39:18,377 --> 00:39:22,974
Rym: CPUs use special Like playing this game with no items like that.

624
00:39:23,014 --> 00:39:24,200
Rym: There's a time and a place for that.

625
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:28,560
Scott: Yeah, that's that's basically f-zero right and we might do that until f-zero comes out for the switch.

626
00:39:28,681 --> 00:39:30,260
Scott: But f-zero hasn't come out for the switch.

627
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,467
Scott: So we might choose that option.

628
00:39:31,607 --> 00:39:33,940
Rym: but I do prefer generally to play with items.

629
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:38,260
Scott: Yeah items are I mean, especially the skill items green shell banana peel, right?

630
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,040
Scott: It's like there's no bullshit in those.

631
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:44,220
Scott: You have to actually aim and hit someone with the green shell and they can defend themselves and they can dodge it.

632
00:39:44,521 --> 00:39:45,525
Scott: They got a rearview mirror.

633
00:39:45,565 --> 00:39:47,032
Scott: they get right banana peel.

634
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:50,348
Scott: It's like well, don't fucking run over the banana peel You won't have a fucking problem, right?

635
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:59,460
Scott: It's a skill based item Right only like the red shell the blue shell the lightning and even the lightning is not so bad because it hits literally everyone.

636
00:39:59,902 --> 00:40:04,860
Scott: So if you're in first, well, you know that the guys in second third fourth fifth also all got hit with lightning.

637
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:11,720
Scott: You're not gonna get boned by that right, you know, it would be bullshit If only first place got lightning, but that's not it's not it's just an equalizer.

638
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:15,955
Scott: It slows everyone down except for one person and they're not getting anywhere.

639
00:40:15,975 --> 00:40:16,718
Scott: Yeah, right.

640
00:40:16,738 --> 00:40:17,380
Scott: They're not catching up.

641
00:40:19,122 --> 00:40:25,380
Rym: So in terms of actual like gameplay like it is definitely, you know, every Mario Kart sort of replaces the previous one.

642
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:36,049
Rym: It's not like Smash Brothers where the like Tournament scene just seems to like keep every version around forever and have their own separate tournaments and it's not like a Mario Tennis Situation where they literally ruin the game.

643
00:40:36,069 --> 00:40:38,660
Scott: Yeah, where they make the game less good in the newer very now.

644
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:48,680
Scott: I was worried before the switch was announced and came out that Mario actually but in a way they did make it less good But they made less good an option like you can choose less good or choose not less.

645
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:58,095
Rym: Well, that is exactly it because when they released on the 3ds Mario Tennis, they literally made it bad and to this day I think we're the only people who pointed that out in a review what they did.

646
00:40:58,356 --> 00:41:03,440
Scott: No one even understands Nobody's analyzing Mario Tennis to the level of speedrunner types.

647
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,916
Scott: Yeah, cuz I don't think you can really do a Mario Tennis speedrun for those of you.

648
00:41:06,956 --> 00:41:07,620
Scott: Maybe we should.

649
00:41:08,826 --> 00:41:08,968
Rym: well.

650
00:41:08,988 --> 00:41:18,820
Rym: for those of you unaware the Mario Tennis was a game of positioning and timing and Like decision like what kind of attack to do like aiming those attacks.

651
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:25,811
Rym: So you could move to a spot and you could hit the button and your character would try to hit the ball Exactly when you hit the button.

652
00:41:25,831 --> 00:41:26,737
Rym: and there was other stuff you could do.

653
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:31,080
Rym: obviously In the Mario Kart on the 3ds Mario Tennis Mario Tennis.

654
00:41:31,362 --> 00:41:33,559
Rym: What they did is they made it to where?

655
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:37,860
Rym: When you hit the button has no impact on when your character hits the ball.

656
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:45,652
Scott: As long as you hit as long as you press the hit correct button As long as you press the correct button within the timing window You're gonna hit the ball in Mario.

657
00:41:45,733 --> 00:41:49,694
Scott: in previous Mario Tennis It mattered where within the timing window you hit the ball.

658
00:41:49,895 --> 00:41:51,000
Scott: It would hit the ball differently.

659
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:57,948
Rym: Yeah Like you made it less complex Like you would do crazy crap like be up and up to the net and just like BAM BAM Just like swatting things down.

660
00:41:57,989 --> 00:41:59,699
Rym: if you were skilled you could pull that kind of stuff off.

661
00:42:00,425 --> 00:42:04,876
Rym: They got rid of all that and made the game Literally worthless from a competitive standpoint.

662
00:42:05,037 --> 00:42:10,820
Rym: Mm-hmm And I was worried after that that Mario that in general Nintendo competitive games are gonna go down that road.

663
00:42:11,001 --> 00:42:12,351
Scott: No, they made it optional in this.

664
00:42:12,411 --> 00:42:21,270
Rym: Mario Kart, which is Mario Party's kind of went down that road too, even though they're already way down that road Party is already a random game.

665
00:42:21,391 --> 00:42:22,899
Rym: Yeah, but they kept going down that road.

666
00:42:23,441 --> 00:42:30,560
Rym: But Mario Kart 8 game for Mario Party is pretty legit because it has that option to be kind of baby mode.

667
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:34,830
Scott: It also has the option to be super real mode.

668
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:37,120
Scott: you can play 200 CC no items, let's go.

669
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,905
Scott: Yeah, just super hardcore.

670
00:42:40,169 --> 00:42:43,740
Rym: Yep, 200 CC when you're playing without items is basically real talk.

671
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,541
Scott: It's basically f-zero Right.

672
00:42:45,943 --> 00:42:54,140
Scott: and you know the environments in on the maps of Mario Kart are crazy and you might say well That's not f-zero f-zero right, but it's like actually f-zero maps are kind of crazy, too.

673
00:42:55,142 --> 00:42:57,579
Scott: They don't have obstacles and shit necessarily, but you know what?

674
00:42:59,741 --> 00:43:04,020
Scott: The environment affects all the racers equally like you go to a golf course and it's raining.

675
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,245
Scott: well It's like well, it's raining on everybody.

676
00:43:05,285 --> 00:43:07,474
Scott: It's not you know, so I think it's totally cool.

677
00:43:07,715 --> 00:43:08,820
Scott: I like mini golf style.

678
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:11,069
Scott: I don't think that makes it anti-competitive in any way.

679
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:13,418
Scott: Yeah, it's like you hit the moo moo cow and I didn't.

680
00:43:13,438 --> 00:43:14,040
Scott: that's your problem.

681
00:43:14,741 --> 00:43:16,819
Scott: Don't hit it next time suck you suck at driving.

682
00:43:17,561 --> 00:43:22,460
Rym: So I feel like I'm gonna play this a lot and I'll just retire the 3ds one because literally no reason ever play that version.

683
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,807
Scott: Yeah, I think this is not like you.

684
00:43:23,908 --> 00:43:26,100
Scott: if you got a switch you're gonna have this Mario Kart, right?

685
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:33,240
Scott: It's gonna be your game And you can play with four switches and two people per switch erratically, right?

686
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:40,318
Scott: But I when you do split-screen, it's hard to play not because you're small real estate But because you have a narrow field of view.

687
00:43:41,342 --> 00:43:47,337
Scott: There are a lot of times I was like messing up turns because I couldn't see where I was going Screen because I couldn't see too far to left and right.

688
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:49,390
Rym: Yep Nothing, but the real problem.

689
00:43:49,611 --> 00:43:50,356
Rym: and we ran into this.

690
00:43:50,376 --> 00:43:51,020
Rym: we were playing it today.

691
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,700
Rym: This is the first time we did multiplayer just to check the game out.

692
00:43:55,404 --> 00:43:56,596
Rym: My switch kept disconnecting.

693
00:43:57,361 --> 00:44:04,680
Scott: Yeah, like constantly but any when it was doc any Nintendo wireless thing ever has never had good connection.

694
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,292
Scott: I've always had connection issues.

695
00:44:06,392 --> 00:44:07,279
Rym: I got real good.

696
00:44:08,281 --> 00:44:11,874
Scott: Yes, the 3ds everything always had wireless connection issues.

697
00:44:11,934 --> 00:44:17,100
Rym: I got real good at the 3ds Mario Kart and I also played a lot of 3ds like Smash Brothers.

698
00:44:17,824 --> 00:44:28,594
Rym: I have never been able to play any Sustained number of games of either of them with other human beings because it just disconnects Constantly even in play even not at just the conventions were taught.

699
00:44:28,614 --> 00:44:29,840
Scott: too many people are trying to use it.

700
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,860
Scott: Right, we're talking about anywhere like in your house in the quiet my apartment.

701
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:35,060
Rym: That doesn't even get cell service from the outside.

702
00:44:35,401 --> 00:44:40,620
Rym: By switch was a few feet away from Scott and I was sitting on the couch playing on the TV and it just kept.

703
00:44:41,021 --> 00:44:43,510
Scott: We think it might be because his was docked and mine wasn't.

704
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:45,336
Scott: once he undocked it seemed to work.

705
00:44:45,517 --> 00:44:47,564
Scott: as soon as I undocked Zero disconnect.

706
00:44:47,585 --> 00:44:50,034
Scott: It's still you know, it's still shaky right?

707
00:44:50,074 --> 00:44:51,680
Scott: Nintendo Wireless is always shaky.

708
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:52,117
Scott: Yeah

709
00:44:52,762 --> 00:45:05,175
Rym: the worst was I went to PAX Australia the last time and I was there by myself like I had a bunch of friends in Australia like the awesome crew but there was a bunch of time and I was like by myself and I thought oh I'll go to the concerts and just play smash with people.

710
00:45:05,416 --> 00:45:06,963
Rym: So I go to the concerts I lay in a beanbag.

711
00:45:06,983 --> 00:45:12,585
Rym: I'm hanging out and there's a bunch of people with the SS and none of them play smash and they're saying Oh, yeah, it's nothing can connect.

712
00:45:12,605 --> 00:45:13,830
Rym: We're all just playing single-player games.

713
00:45:14,132 --> 00:45:18,438
Rym: So I rallied everyone like yeah, let's just try it Let's make it work and it does not work at all.

714
00:45:19,501 --> 00:45:20,204
Scott: So that's the thing.

715
00:45:20,224 --> 00:45:25,908
Scott: Yeah, but there's online play the online play, you know Lag varies based on who you're playing against.

716
00:45:26,209 --> 00:45:31,129
Scott: but Nintendo online play is free on the switch right now But it's gonna become non free at some point.

717
00:45:31,329 --> 00:45:39,860
Scott: I will I think that online play is gonna just be a non starter Have to see how if it's worth paying for like how much do you actually use it, right?

718
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:42,309
Rym: I am confident that it will not be worth paying for.

719
00:45:42,349 --> 00:45:44,097
Scott: I don't think I'm gonna pay for it cuz I can the we.

720
00:45:44,438 --> 00:45:45,883
Scott: I played Like dr.

721
00:45:45,923 --> 00:45:48,371
Scott: Mario online a few times and it's like they were.

722
00:45:48,391 --> 00:45:51,540
Scott: just you know, it was not as sustainable on the switch.

723
00:45:51,680 --> 00:46:05,196
Rym: We tried to play Bomberman online and like the idea of netcode does not seem to exist on Nintendo consoles Like there's like it the way lag Interacted with us at least in that Bomberman which obviously is a very small sample size

724
00:46:05,236 --> 00:46:07,499
Scott: did patch it recently though So we haven't tried it.

725
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:14,397
Rym: Yeah But the lag acted like PC games acted in the 90s with lag as opposed to how PC games in 2017 act with lag.

726
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:19,071
Rym: Yeah, or how tribes who acted with lag in the early 2000s?

727
00:46:19,251 --> 00:46:21,258
Scott: You could play tribes to online if 56 came out.

728
00:46:22,081 --> 00:46:22,564
Scott: It would work.

729
00:46:22,604 --> 00:46:23,832
Scott: Well, it wasn't great.

730
00:46:23,972 --> 00:46:25,180
Rym: It was totally playable.

731
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:25,884
Scott: You could play.

732
00:46:25,904 --> 00:46:33,407
Rym: you would have trouble if you were in like an intense spin fuser battle But if you were near other players or if you're playing like normal game, it worked pretty well.

733
00:46:33,487 --> 00:46:41,500
Rym: Yeah, but this Mario Kart is The Mario Kart and I feel like because the switch is like it is a legit console like it's real.

734
00:46:41,761 --> 00:46:45,360
Scott: You should probably buy it and Nintendo has done re-releases of their games before right?

735
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:47,914
Scott: It's like they'd like Wind Waker HD and stuff like that.

736
00:46:47,934 --> 00:46:49,040
Scott: It's like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.

737
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:53,238
Scott: It's like oh they just re-released this old this game that already exists this game that exists on the Wii U.

738
00:46:53,278 --> 00:46:53,700
Rym: that none of you.

739
00:46:53,841 --> 00:46:57,657
Scott: Right, there's no reason you don't skipping the Wii U was the smart move.

740
00:46:57,757 --> 00:46:58,340
Scott: I was smart.

741
00:46:58,581 --> 00:46:59,304
Scott: I am so smart.

742
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:02,416
Scott: I bought the switch instead of the Wii U. I made a good move.

743
00:47:02,456 --> 00:47:03,420
Scott: and now here's Mario Kart.

744
00:47:03,922 --> 00:47:06,113
Scott: So so here's all those games.

745
00:47:06,314 --> 00:47:12,483
Scott: just like I said, aha I was so sure that you know, the switch should be backwards compatible with the Wii U. But it wasn't.

746
00:47:12,744 --> 00:47:16,580
Scott: but hey, they were releasing the Wii U games to the switch pretty much immediately.

747
00:47:16,961 --> 00:47:18,688
Scott: Yeah, so there you go.

748
00:47:18,728 --> 00:47:20,515
Rym: Like here's the history of me and Nintendo consoles.

749
00:47:20,555 --> 00:47:21,759
Rym: It was NES SNES.

750
00:47:22,383 --> 00:47:33,120
Rym: I skipped the n64 we had the GameCube Then I got DS GBA DS 3DS switch and I skipped everything else.

751
00:47:33,221 --> 00:47:34,954
Scott: I had a Game Boy Color DS.

752
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:38,700
Rym: I did get a Game Boy But we got the Game Boy way later.

753
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:42,900
Rym: We actually had a Game Gear first and the Game Gear was mine and the Game Boy was my brother's.

754
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,828
Scott: As soon as the next handheld one.

755
00:47:44,908 --> 00:47:47,660
Scott: I mean, I've got every handheld right after the Game Boy.

756
00:47:47,901 --> 00:47:50,980
Rym: I never got another portable Nintendo console until the GBA.

757
00:47:52,821 --> 00:48:01,017
Scott: Anyway, so but you one thing I wanted you talked about before is Mario Party Even though Mario Party is his baby game Mario Party on the switch.

758
00:48:01,157 --> 00:48:04,290
Scott: just one of them Whichever one comes first is gonna be one at some point.

759
00:48:04,350 --> 00:48:05,254
Scott: Yeah, that's gonna.

760
00:48:05,294 --> 00:48:06,580
Scott: you just gotta get that one, right?

761
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:07,127
Scott: I don't know.

762
00:48:07,148 --> 00:48:08,786
Scott: We'll see Mario Party 9 or 10 or 11 whatever number it is.

763
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:17,360
Rym: I looked at some of the minigames and more recent Mario parties and I just feel like Mario Party is not for me.

764
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:21,254
Scott: I feel like a Mario Party but on switch could be so lit though.

765
00:48:21,294 --> 00:48:22,358
Rym: I feel like Mario Party.

766
00:48:23,061 --> 00:48:23,442
Rym: We could.

767
00:48:23,583 --> 00:48:30,487
Rym: I could only play it if we were actually streaming it and treating it more like a variety show But not that the actual game.

768
00:48:31,009 --> 00:48:31,952
Scott: I think on the switch.

769
00:48:31,973 --> 00:48:33,658
Scott: I think they could revive it for like one more.

770
00:48:33,719 --> 00:48:34,370
Scott: go We'll see.

771
00:48:34,981 --> 00:48:37,169
Rym: The last time I thought it was portable.

772
00:48:37,209 --> 00:48:41,226
Scott: you could just plop it on a table and start playing it and you hand out the mini Joy-cons.

773
00:48:41,307 --> 00:48:41,729
Scott: and true.

774
00:48:41,749 --> 00:48:47,755
Scott: Yeah, as long as you don't Joy cons have motion stuff in them and you can get.

775
00:48:47,916 --> 00:48:48,620
Scott: you know, they can get great.

776
00:48:49,162 --> 00:48:54,000
Rym: But case in point Wario where they only made one good one and it was the one on the game of cube, right?

777
00:48:54,180 --> 00:49:02,919
Scott: But imagine like we're sitting at someplace Sitting around the switch and everyone's got joy con and you see it's like the Nintendo finger minigame.

778
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:04,645
Scott: go It's a good time.

779
00:49:04,947 --> 00:49:15,690
Rym: Yeah, but they could have done that with Wario where they never did In fact, they released Wario where in the early days pretty sure there is a Mario Party on the Wii U. So, you know then who talks about it?

780
00:49:15,710 --> 00:49:18,019
Scott: What do you heard of which is like built for Mario Party?

781
00:49:18,059 --> 00:49:18,280
Scott: Come on.

782
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:22,875
Rym: Yeah, the switch is built for Wario where and they're never gonna make a good Wario where.

783
00:49:22,936 --> 00:49:25,283
Rym: I would I will eat my hat if They make a good Wario where.

784
00:49:25,403 --> 00:49:33,200
Scott: I think I do think the department at Nintendo that made like the second tier quirky games Has somehow disappeared?

785
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:40,669
Rym: Yeah And I wish it would come back because that the game the game cube era Remains like Nintendo's most innovative era.

786
00:49:40,729 --> 00:50:00,560
Scott: right during the game of cube days and the you know GVA days like there was a lot of these like quirky not prime time top tier Nintendo games Like they were producing on publishing all these second tier games that you know We're still official Nintendo games, but they were and they were great and awesome But no one paid too much attention to them, right?

787
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:05,220
Scott: There was that one where the guy was like the plug on his head and it was a whole bunch of Wario games.

788
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:11,534
Scott: yeah, like What's the other one I had like something the the robot battling things.

789
00:50:11,594 --> 00:50:24,305
Scott: that game wasn't that good, you know The Pikmin's right, you know now they're coming out some Pikmin platformer right now There were a bunch of Kirby games like the canvas curse and the DS and like all these You know, I'd be second tier Nintendo games.

790
00:50:24,486 --> 00:50:26,312
Scott: I feel like those don't really exist right now.

791
00:50:26,332 --> 00:50:28,920
Scott: I like the Mario Superstar saga.

792
00:50:30,841 --> 00:50:32,039
Scott: We're having all those games.

793
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:35,800
Rym: So the only other thing is I guess we can actually talk about the battle mode.

794
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:41,054
Rym: It is probably the best battle mode that's ever existed in a Mario still garbage.

795
00:50:41,255 --> 00:50:50,447
Scott: Yeah, it's not great But as a balloon fight where you drive around the track and if you get hit five times You die and you lose.

796
00:50:50,508 --> 00:50:54,560
Scott: but it's really judging you based on how many people balloons you break on other people.

797
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:56,160
Scott: It's like I ran around and barely got hit.

798
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:59,594
Scott: But I also didn't really hit me which is good because usually you complain about me.

799
00:50:59,654 --> 00:51:01,743
Rym: in any game like that is where's Rym hide In the corner.

800
00:51:02,024 --> 00:51:02,185
Scott: Yeah.

801
00:51:02,205 --> 00:51:03,029
Scott: Well, there's a mini-map.

802
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:04,216
Scott: you can see where everyone's hiding.

803
00:51:04,437 --> 00:51:06,248
Rym: Oh, yeah, come get me I'll go to the other corner, right?

804
00:51:06,611 --> 00:51:07,960
Scott: Well, you just got to drive fast.

805
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:11,380
Rym: There's a bomb blast which is the exact same thing except people only have a bombs.

806
00:51:11,842 --> 00:51:14,371
Scott: Yeah, pretty much and it's judging you based on your kills.

807
00:51:14,431 --> 00:51:16,860
Scott: But and if you die completely you lose three of your kills.

808
00:51:17,761 --> 00:51:25,513
Scott: There's a coin one which is like collect coins and like collect the most Coins and you can hit people and they lose their coins and then you get more coins.

809
00:51:25,855 --> 00:51:26,617
Rym: It's yeah.

810
00:51:26,738 --> 00:51:30,559
Scott: Yeah There's one that was slightly interesting which is the cops and robbers.

811
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,240
Rym: one Yeah, but they do not do a mirror match which I think is bullshit.

812
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:36,070
Scott: It's a. six people are cops.

813
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:38,080
Scott: effectively in six people are about renegades.

814
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:40,628
Scott: They said I was like renegades and something else.

815
00:51:40,688 --> 00:51:44,620
Scott: the cops have piranha plants the cops all have piranha plants and the renegades have nothing.

816
00:51:45,027 --> 00:51:49,675
Scott: It's just get away It's just don't get caught by the people with piranha plants and the piranha plant.

817
00:51:49,695 --> 00:51:50,157
Scott: people try.

818
00:51:50,237 --> 00:51:51,040
Scott: it's two teams.

819
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:52,109
Rym: Well, it's a kid's game.

820
00:51:52,149 --> 00:51:57,460
Rym: It's not six eggs It's jail tag or whatever kids would call that where if you get tagged got to go to jail.

821
00:51:57,802 --> 00:52:00,000
Rym: But if someone gets to the jail they can let everybody out.

822
00:52:00,301 --> 00:52:02,049
Scott: I couldn't figure out where the jail was or anything.

823
00:52:02,089 --> 00:52:04,280
Scott: I just ate a few people with my piranha plant and then it ended.

824
00:52:04,481 --> 00:52:05,043
Rym: Yep, I got.

825
00:52:05,144 --> 00:52:06,490
Scott: it ended pretty good jailed.

826
00:52:06,510 --> 00:52:08,540
Rym: You're literally just driving around in this tiny jail.

827
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:09,909
Scott: It ended pretty quickly.

828
00:52:09,929 --> 00:52:11,560
Scott: I think because we put their whole team in jail.

829
00:52:11,922 --> 00:52:15,520
Rym: Yeah, it was me and Scott were the only humans were playing with a eyes and they're not great.

830
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,693
Scott: There's one other mode which is the shine mode which is basically king of the hill.

831
00:52:18,753 --> 00:52:28,155
Scott: you get there's a shine on the map you Get it now you have it until you lose it by getting it smacked out of you I guess and you hold on to it for a long period of time and you're getting points.

832
00:52:28,255 --> 00:52:33,977
Scott: as you hold it and if you reach Certain number of points the game ends and you win and then second place is whoever held it.

833
00:52:34,038 --> 00:52:34,620
Scott: the second long.

834
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:38,740
Rym: Yeah, you basically get points in the you know, the tournament or whatever you're doing by how long you did it.

835
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:42,600
Rym: So it does reward the person who was in first the whole time and just got robbed at the end.

836
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:43,479
Scott: Yeah, they come in second.

837
00:52:44,381 --> 00:52:55,199
Scott: But it's like I got it immediately held on to it for what I think was almost enough to win based on the score and then it got stolen from me by a CPU and they held it long enough to win and then it was over.

838
00:52:55,219 --> 00:52:57,432
Scott: and It's kind of boring.

839
00:52:57,716 --> 00:53:03,440
Rym: Yep But I think the verdicts in like the part point of this isn't necessarily do a deep deep deep review.

840
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:08,180
Scott: It's like they just shove the battle mode in there because I guess people out there like battle mode.

841
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:10,880
Scott: But we don't like battle mode, but the racing mode is worth your money.

842
00:53:11,043 --> 00:53:11,860
Scott: You just ignore the battle.

843
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:15,329
Rym: The moral is the switch is a legit Nintendo console.

844
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:19,800
Rym: and now there's the second round of first party games coming out.

845
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,152
Rym: There's a reason to buy one.

846
00:53:21,173 --> 00:53:21,859
Scott: still round one.

847
00:53:22,382 --> 00:53:26,820
Rym: Well, I mean they staggered it such that you've pretty much only had breath of the wild.

848
00:53:27,743 --> 00:53:28,489
Scott: Still round one.

849
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:29,920
Rym: Yeah, but this came out.

850
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,466
Rym: I mean look it came out way to.

851
00:53:31,506 --> 00:53:32,490
Scott: round two is gonna.

852
00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:37,150
Scott: I there might be a round two before the holiday season But I feel like holiday season is actually round two.

853
00:53:37,451 --> 00:53:43,213
Scott: There might be a summer round two, maybe Maybe but the holiday season is when that Mario game comes.

854
00:53:43,253 --> 00:53:43,695
Scott: that's real.

855
00:53:43,736 --> 00:53:47,380
Scott: round two for sure Yeah, or round three if they somehow make a big summer release.

856
00:53:47,801 --> 00:53:53,180
Rym: But uh, I'm not saying that Nintendo is back to the buy side on the scene for me because they know I didn't buy this.

857
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:53,503
Rym: Which way?

858
00:53:53,725 --> 00:53:55,137
Rym: right away I waited to see.

859
00:53:56,240 --> 00:54:03,660
Scott: But I think I'm just gonna buy all the first-party games as they come out and Once you already buy the console, you're not getting your money's worth unless you buy games.

860
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:08,529
Rym: Yeah, I've got every first-party game, but I'm not even gonna wait to see Progress fee for the apartment.

861
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:09,899
Scott: You better live there a fucking long time.

862
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:13,329
Scott: You buy a switch you better start buying a lot of switch games.

863
00:54:13,389 --> 00:54:14,914
Scott: Otherwise you wasted your money on that switch.

864
00:54:15,175 --> 00:54:16,058
Scott: Yeah, unless you sell it.

865
00:54:17,067 --> 00:54:22,637
Rym: so It's not really relevant to Mario Kart, but I am buying every game digital and that is a 100% policy.

866
00:54:23,662 --> 00:54:25,236
Scott: Don't buy any cartridges now.

867
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:32,164
Rym: Digital distribution sucks because one you can't back up your save files and two It doesn't see like.

868
00:54:32,465 --> 00:54:33,649
Rym: basically you can't eat.

869
00:54:33,669 --> 00:54:37,520
Rym: like if you buy another switch, you can't transfer your games not easily.

870
00:54:37,621 --> 00:54:38,248
Scott: Anyway, there

871
00:54:38,268 --> 00:54:40,530
Rym: doesn't seem to be any way to do it but to get Nintendo to do

872
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:49,220
Scott: it and Was able to transfer and when I had a Wii which also had the same problem and my Wii was stole I was able to get all my games back on the new week.

873
00:54:49,321 --> 00:54:52,260
Rym: I feel like there's no good process for that and you lose all your save games.

874
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:55,269
Rym: You can't even back save games up on the SD card.

875
00:54:55,931 --> 00:55:02,153
Rym: They're tied intrinsically to the hardware with no way out Unless someone hacks it and I feel like Nintendo is never gonna fix that.

876
00:55:02,354 --> 00:55:02,857
Scott: Well, we'll see.

877
00:55:02,877 --> 00:55:12,940
Scott: Yeah I mean, it's definitely got DRM and lockdown and problems But it's just like well the convenience of not using the slow loading cartridges and having to have these tiny cartridges that you lose.

878
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:14,708
Scott: Yeah, it's like well just fuck it.

879
00:55:14,989 --> 00:55:17,580
Rym: And yeah, you might be saying but Rym and Scott I want to lick the cartridge.

880
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:18,022

Rym: I see you in slow motion going fuck.

891
00:55:41,661 --> 00:55:45,535
Rym: You make a motion like this and the bamboo goes up into the air.

892
00:55:45,556 --> 00:55:46,760
Scott: it didn't go that.

893
00:55:47,504 --> 00:55:53,399
Rym: And it spills a tiny bit of that water outside of itself and the room goes.

894
00:55:58,123 --> 00:56:00,411
Rym: That was one of the worst things I've ever smelled my entire life.

Rym: Here is our world our planet Earth floating in space.

923
00:58:07,556 --> 00:58:25,066
Rym: We will be going backward in time imperfectly, but done in a very disciplined manner, please Notice there is no subduction no rotation of tectonic plates No twisting no form-fitting no altering shapes or sizes.

924
00:58:25,126 --> 00:58:32,084
Rym: it would be impossible Impossible for these continental plates to fit together perfectly without this being true.

925
00:58:32,244 --> 00:58:39,549
Rym: and yet the upper tectonic plates fit together perfectly on a much smaller planet.

926
00:58:40,611 --> 00:58:45,690
Rym: Yes, there's been some erosion landslides blah blah, but overall this activity is insignificant.

927
00:58:46,572 --> 00:58:49,990
Rym: There is a kind of conspiracy of silence among certain scientists.

928
00:58:50,332 --> 00:59:00,625
Rym: They know but are not telling you that the upper tectonic plates of Earth Also join in the Pacific not partially they join totally.

929
00:59:00,986 --> 00:59:07,850
Rym: you are asked to believe that the continents Swim or drift about willy-nilly Bumping and crashing as if they were on a grease skillet.

930
00:59:08,758 --> 00:59:09,949
Rym: This is not true.

931
00:59:11,132 --> 00:59:14,890
Rym: The simple truth is apparently too upsetting to too many apple carts.
