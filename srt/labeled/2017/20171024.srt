00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,921
Rym: It's Tuesday, October 24th, 2017, and this is a Spooky October GeekNights.

2
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:17,378
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,708
Scott: I am the Ghost of Skaar, oooh.

4
00:00:21,191 --> 00:00:34,908
Rym: And tonight, we are talking about a game that is called, and I am quoting directly, "Ciderial Confluence colon Trading and Negotiation in the Elysian

5
00:00:35,028 --> 00:00:35,670
Rym: Quadrants."

6
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:36,445
Rym: AKA SpaceCube.

7
00:00:37,277 --> 00:00:38,390
Rym: Cube Trader the game.

8
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:38,946
Scott: SpaceCube.

9
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:50,050
Rym: So, yeah, it's October and I am sticking to this theme of trying to make spooky themed episodes of GeekNights, no matter how thin that theme is.

10
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,369
Scott: You know what the spookiest thing is?

11
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:55,824
Scott: Is that in like five days, GeekNights will be 12 years old.

12
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,430
Rym: Yeah, 12th anniversary of GeekNights.

13
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:01,329
Scott: That's old.

14
00:01:01,931 --> 00:01:06,748
Scott: If we had a baby then, that baby would be 12 now and could talk and be useful and be on the podcast.

15
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,288
Rym: Well, GeekNights can talk.

16
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:09,690
Rym: Great.

17
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:13,410
Rym: There's like 14 to 1500 hours of it talking.

18
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:13,900
Scott: Sure.

19
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:23,410
Rym: You know, some day, someone could, my hope is that long after we're dead, machine learning can take the entire archive of GeekNights and continue to make episodes forever.

20
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:24,610
Scott: That'd be cool.

21
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,810
Rym: That's actually like kind of feasible.

22
00:01:27,911 --> 00:01:31,709
Rym: Actually machine learning could probably just keep making episodes of Erise at Sura in around my one-half.

23
00:01:35,032 --> 00:01:44,050
Rym: So yeah, and as we said, we did this thing that we, in our hubris, called Review Con when it was literally just us and a bunch of our good friends playing board games.

24
00:01:45,250 --> 00:02:01,870
Rym: But in our hubris, Con Plague appeared and not in our hubris, but I wanted to Geek Bite one of the games we played at this mini convention because there is no way we could ever do a full episode of GeekNights on Spinderella.

25
00:02:02,734 --> 00:02:03,629
Scott: No, no, there isn't.

26
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:10,770
Rym: Unless we expanded to talk about dexterity games or like, I already realized there are ways to take this game and make it better.

27
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:23,429
Rym: Like you can make a pretty legit game, but the game is notable in that if you put it in a library at a PAX, I think a lot of people would check it out and play it once just for the novelty.

28
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:24,086
Rym: Oh yeah.

29
00:02:24,712 --> 00:02:30,250
Scott: I think it's the kind of game you don't even put away because you don't want, you know, you just want to leave it set up, right?

30
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:30,851
Scott: In fact,

31
00:02:30,891 --> 00:02:44,383
Rym: that's an idea for a future Unplugged to have a table that has like one area that has Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots, Spinderella, Crossfire, like all those kinds of games where people want to go and touch it and then realize they're not that good and then stop touching them.

32
00:02:44,711 --> 00:02:46,868
Scott: The board, like an arena of some kind for...

33
00:02:47,131 --> 00:02:47,788
Rym: Touching games.

34
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:48,650
Scott: Interesting games.

35
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,949
Scott: The one where you put the crane on your head.

36
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:50,355
Scott: Yeah.

37
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,829
Rym: Maybe I'll put a bunch of copies of Elkfest over there.

38
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:55,728
Rym: That's not a bad idea.

39
00:02:56,711 --> 00:03:00,349
Scott: The Elkfest tournament, the crossing of the Elk, one of those big...

40
00:03:01,013 --> 00:03:03,310
Rym: Elkfest tournament across the entirety of tabletop.

41
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:08,232
Scott: Just one, no, just have one of the long tables, but you only have to get across it the short way.

42
00:03:08,252 --> 00:03:10,550
Scott: and there's all these multiple games, right?

43
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:11,450
Rym: Everyone's playing a game.

44
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:12,470
Rym: And it's just real time.

45
00:03:12,633 --> 00:03:12,767
Rym: Right?

46
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:16,210
Scott: Well, you just have to get across the short little table to your opponent's side, right?

47
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,430
Scott: It's just you play, right?

48
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:23,590
Scott: And then you do a tournament and you narrow it down and when you got two people remaining, then you got to go down the whole long table.

49
00:03:23,991 --> 00:03:25,209
Rym: That ain't a bad idea.

50
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,910
Rym: And you just put a camera on top and just get a time-lapse.

51
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:34,030
Rym: So Spinderella is a kid's game and we played it and the notable thing is...

52
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:39,170
Scott: This game is good for children who have motor skills and can count.

53
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:45,570
Scott: But it also... So if you can play Candyland or Uncle Wiggly or Sorry or Trouble, you can play this game.

54
00:03:45,910 --> 00:04:03,869
Rym: It is interesting in that it has a few mechanics that interact together and unlike a lot of kids' games that hyper restrict what kids can do in the games, this one kind of lets you do these super broken degenerate strategy type things and I think that's actually a plus in its favor.

55
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:08,310
Rym: So basically, you got this magnetic spider contraption.

56
00:04:08,691 --> 00:04:09,790
Scott: It involves two spiders.

57
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,709
Rym: There are two spiders on the top.

58
00:04:12,132 --> 00:04:13,069
Scott: And they have a rope.

59
00:04:13,531 --> 00:04:15,570
Scott: One of them has a pulley and one of them has the end of the rope.

60
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:20,950
Scott: So when you move one spider, it sort of moves the location of the rope.

61
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:25,730
Scott: When you move the others in relation to the first spider, the length of the rope adjusts.

62
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:31,809
Scott: So if the spiders get too far apart, the rope goes way up and if they get too close to each other, it goes way down.

63
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:36,532
Rym: Now, the game pretty much just lets you sort of fudge with it to make what you want to happen happen.

64
00:04:36,552 --> 00:04:42,790
Rym: because the idea is that you're trying to roll your dice and move your mice, but the mice you're moving are little ants that don't want to get eaten by the spider.

65
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:49,576
Rym: And if you get to move the spider, you can move the upper spiders a certain number of spaces on this grid.

66
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:52,510
Rym: and well, this is sort of node system.

67
00:04:53,091 --> 00:05:04,150
Rym: And if you get the magnet spider on the bottom web down and it touches one of the ants and eats it and pretty good mechanic, it's like it works really well.

68
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:09,506
Scott: It's actually basically shoots and ladders, you know, sort of thing where you're trying to get to the end.

69
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:21,530
Scott: But instead of the shoots, there's one shoot and it's controlled by everybody when, depending on the dice, tells people when and how they can control the shoot and shoot always sends you back to the beginning.

70
00:05:21,891 --> 00:05:27,189
Rym: The the other interesting thing is there's a moderately complex mechanic for a kid's game in that there's a tree stump.

71
00:05:27,491 --> 00:05:28,809
Scott: The tree stump is what makes the game work.

72
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:29,995
Rym: You can also move in.

73
00:05:30,015 --> 00:05:34,249
Rym: the way the tree stump works is it's hollow underneath and there's a platform on top.

74
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:43,909
Scott: So if you put the tree stump on an ant that a protects it from the spider, which is good, but also keeps that ant from moving, which is bad.

75
00:05:44,512 --> 00:05:50,408
Rym: But if you move an ant and it lands on top of the tree stump, way easier for the spider to get that ant.

76
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:56,050
Rym: But if the tree stump moves with an ant on it, the ant gets to ride the tree stump.

77
00:05:56,572 --> 00:05:58,230
Scott: So the way you win, didn't I win?

78
00:05:58,851 --> 00:05:59,349
Scott: I don't remember.

79
00:05:59,590 --> 00:05:59,739
Scott: But you.

80
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:00,246
Scott: Yeah.

81
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:00,847
Rym: You know who won?

82
00:06:02,712 --> 00:06:06,010
Rym: The gods won because we fucked up so many rules.

83
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:06,561
Scott: We did.

84
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:11,968
Scott: But the point is we made like teleporting one of the ants to the end like right away with that tree stump.

85
00:06:12,232 --> 00:06:14,390
Rym: And the rules errors were not the fault of the rules.

86
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,589
Rym: The rules are excellently written.

87
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:22,889
Rym: The rules errors were the fault of Matt who taught us this game and did not put due respect to the rules of the game.

88
00:06:24,716 --> 00:06:25,350
Rym: And there's more to it.

89
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:25,990
Rym: It's pretty straightforward.

90
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:35,050
Rym: The one thing I would say, if you're going to play this with people are older than like four to six years old, you could still play it like with eight or nine year olds.

91
00:06:35,971 --> 00:06:42,169
Rym: The only thing I would change is I would make the rule of you touch it, you move it asshole regarding the spiders.

92
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:46,230
Rym: So you can't just sort of like move around to see what will happen.

93
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:50,470
Rym: You got to make your plan and be like, I'll move this spider and then this spider.

94
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:53,870
Scott: And you had to move them precisely and the correct number of spaces.

95
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,808
Scott: We sort of, you know, wiggled with it.

96
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:00,570
Rym: Demo weasel in the chat actually suggest the most important thing about this game.

97
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,830
Rym: Use real spiders and see how many people play it then.

98
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:04,489
Scott: Yeah, sure.

99
00:07:05,256 --> 00:07:06,030
Rym: So this game is cute.

100
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:18,407
Rym: And honestly, if you need a game that is in the genre of games like headache, problematic trouble, uh, sorry for kids, this is better than all of those games, but it is better than those.

101
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:20,390
Scott: It's better than uncle wiggly or candy land.

102
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:30,023
Scott: It's got all the things because kids, I think the one difference is that this might be slightly harder than candy land because the play candy land, you only need to know colors, but to play this different genre.

103
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:31,830
Rym: Candy land is one step down.

104
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,424
Rym: I'm talking about games, one step up from candy land.

105
00:07:34,444 --> 00:07:55,649
Rym: where you literally do not make decisions are games like headache, problematic, trouble, and sorry, where anyone over the age of 12 is not making decisions, but there are decisions that can be made in the game and there is a choice occasionally to completely fuck someone else over because that is a mechanic of trouble.

106
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:56,970
Rym: That is a mechanic of headache.

107
00:07:57,213 --> 00:07:58,429
Rym: That is a mechanic of sorry.

108
00:07:58,792 --> 00:08:00,430
Rym: That is the core mechanic of sorry.

109
00:08:01,232 --> 00:08:09,710
Rym: And that action when a six year old totally fucks over their dad in a game like this or the dad totally fucks over the kid.

110
00:08:10,432 --> 00:08:13,110
Rym: That is what makes those kinds of games fun for families.

111
00:08:13,571 --> 00:08:14,580
Rym: That moment also.

112
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,749
Scott: the spider mechanism is fun.

113
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:18,825
Rym: The spider mechanism is fun and very well thought out.

114
00:08:18,845 --> 00:08:20,128
Scott: just to play with it by yourself is fun.

115
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:30,286
Rym: Now, if you set this up at a table at any gaming con filled solely by adults, I guarantee you would see pretty much constant action until everyone in the room had touched it at least once.

116
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:31,070
Scott: Anyway.

117
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:31,845
Scott: All right.

118
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,370
Scott: So actual gaming news.

119
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:41,389
Scott: So everybody knows that, you know, uh, there's a lot of, uh, sexual assault accusations flying around these days.

120
00:08:41,914 --> 00:08:42,729
Scott: Most of them true.

121
00:08:43,013 --> 00:08:43,948
Scott: Maybe all of them.

122
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,750
Rym: I pretty much give the benefit of the doubt in the appropriate direction in all cases.

123
00:08:48,214 --> 00:08:48,427
Scott: Yeah.

124
00:08:48,691 --> 00:09:09,889
Scott: But, uh, anyway, so I mean, it's always the time to call people out, but obviously, you know, I'm not saying you have to because we all know that calling people out is often, uh, as many negative consequences for the color outer, but if you are brave enough to call people out, please do so because it gives us a great joy to see people go down and go down hard when they deserve it.

125
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:11,230
Rym: Neo gaff.

126
00:09:11,831 --> 00:09:15,789
Rym: I remember Neo gaff from a certain panel we did at a packs a long time ago.

127
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:25,510
Scott: So if you don't know, there was a forum way back called gaff gaming age forum, I think was it originally called and it went down, but the community, they wanted to keep the spirit alive.

128
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:29,850
Scott: So this guy made Neo gaff and the guy, I never knew who made Neo gaff.

129
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:34,490
Scott: Apparently it's someone named evil lore, which is a typical bad internet person name.

130
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:43,070
Scott: Well, it sounds like there might be some nominative determinism here anyway, but evil lore is someone who has not had much visible internet presence.

131
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:48,229
Scott: Not a person that people had seen around, you know, not someone to use their social media in a while.

132
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,720
Rym: So not like, like if park has drew Curtis who like.

133
00:09:51,584 --> 00:09:54,489
Scott: if you're on, you know who drew Curtis is, you can see him, you can talk to him.

134
00:09:54,651 --> 00:09:55,396
Scott: He's out and about.

135
00:09:55,577 --> 00:09:57,610
Rym: low tax is like tweeting all the time, right?

136
00:09:58,011 --> 00:10:01,730
Scott: You know, evil or is one of those behind the scenes internet people you don't hear from ever.

137
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:08,590
Scott: Like I didn't even know who this person was until this week, apparently is a shithead just like all the others I just mentioned.

138
00:10:08,852 --> 00:10:11,670
Scott: And he had been called out rightfully so.

139
00:10:11,931 --> 00:10:17,290
Scott: And his response to being called out was to temporarily completely shut down Neo gaff.

140
00:10:17,831 --> 00:10:27,369
Scott: Now I am not going, I am, this is not even done with the, and then he, they pre purged all posts on Neo gaff about his, uh, badness.

141
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,770
Rym: All I was going to say is that banned many peoples.

142
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:32,666
Rym: There is a presumption of innocence in the U?

143
00:10:32,746 --> 00:10:33,390
Rym: S legal system.

144
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:37,130
Rym: And I respect that because that is a very important part of our justice system.

145
00:10:37,651 --> 00:10:45,549
Rym: But at the same time, the actions that were taken by this individual are not the actions one would take if said allegations were in fact false.

146
00:10:46,352 --> 00:10:48,629
Rym: That is just a supposition I'm putting out there.

147
00:10:48,850 --> 00:11:06,608
Scott: Uh, anyway, uh, also the number of times people make false accusations along those lines, considering, you know, the repercussions of making even true accusations, uh, it's pretty rare for there to be false accusations, which is why I tend to believe any accusations that come out.

148
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,389
Rym: I mean, it seems like Neo gaff has always been kind of a hole anyway.

149
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:14,269
Scott: Well, no, here's the thing that you don't, you're not letting me finish his story and you didn't obviously didn't read the story either.

150
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,370
Rym: I have skimmed the top of this article.

151
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:18,250
Scott: You don't know jack about what's going on, right?

152
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:18,422
Scott: Nope.

153
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:22,270
Scott: Basically they took down Neo gaff.

154
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:28,649
Scott: All the people in Neo gaff were hitting evil or hard where it hurts and that's why he took it down.

155
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:35,028
Scott: He was trying to chill the descent and people were like, you were like evil or you're a scumbag ban me.

156
00:11:35,351 --> 00:11:41,470
Scott: That was like, that was the general sentiment on Neo gaff and now that it's back, sentiment hasn't changed.

157
00:11:41,812 --> 00:11:42,150
Rym: You're right.

158
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,649
Rym: Like every moderator quit.

159
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,630
Scott: And they got new moderators, but they're anonymous.

160
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:46,855
Scott: Yeah.

161
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:49,150
Rym: Meaning it's all gamer gators probably.

162
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:53,770
Scott: He keeps shut down the off topic sections of the site now and all this kind of stuff.

163
00:11:54,070 --> 00:12:01,012
Scott: So basically he shut down Neo gaff to figure out how you could keep people on it from attacking him.

164
00:12:01,373 --> 00:12:13,629
Scott: and obviously that doesn't work cause this is internet and now it's back up at least now and I don't know, but yeah, uh, I never went to Neo gaff other than a Google search result when it was relevant once.

165
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:14,350
Scott: Yeah.

166
00:12:14,612 --> 00:12:16,469
Rym: One time we went to Neo gaff once.

167
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:17,290
Scott: Anyway.

168
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:29,550
Scott: Uh, but apparently the general community of Neo gaff seems to be good even though the person who made it is the worst and it seems like that community is now basically done for a, okay, that's fine.

169
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:36,649
Rym: You know, that's actually interesting because I can, I generally assume that places on the internet are bad places and less proven otherwise.

170
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:43,950
Rym: So I started to assume Neo gaff was kind of a whole, I actually have a mad respect now for the core community that they were like, fuck this.

171
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,749
Scott: I mean, you didn't respect the people who made dude, bro.

172
00:12:46,395 --> 00:12:46,970
Rym: Oh yeah.

173
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:53,170
Rym: But I also read that not every post in the dude, bro thread was good people.

174
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:57,270
Scott: Anyway, just saying not every post on Neo gaff is good people now either.

175
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:05,709
Rym: But if you, uh, you loan some Neo gaff people who have fled in disgust and are afraid of these probably GG moderate are not listening to GeekNights.

176
00:13:06,231 --> 00:13:11,207
Rym: If you find out about GeekNights, just say in our forums pretty good and we will never have a problem like that.

177
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:13,170
Scott: No, we definitely won't have that problem.

178
00:13:13,572 --> 00:13:16,890
Rym: We are very proactive in banning people who do things anyway.

179
00:13:18,211 --> 00:13:25,869
Scott: So let's talk about the other mildly related news of things in the gaming journalism community area having problems.

180
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:27,889
Scott: The escapist people don't know.

181
00:13:28,733 --> 00:13:32,010
Scott: I saw the escapist on the very first day it went live.

182
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:33,227
Rym: I was still working at IBM.

183
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:34,408
Rym: I'd like read it.

184
00:13:34,996 --> 00:13:35,667
Scott: I was at RIT.

185
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,810
Rym: I was on co-op at IBM.

186
00:13:38,352 --> 00:13:40,990
Scott: The original escapist was not something you could read every morning.

187
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:48,570
Scott: The original escapist, they were trying to be a magazine of long form video game, real hardcore journalism.

188
00:13:49,151 --> 00:13:55,730
Scott: And what it was originally was his website you went to and you couldn't like get text of the articles like a normal blog.

189
00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:01,850
Scott: It was like trying to be like a PDF or some interactive, you know, magazine, but just in digital form, right?

190
00:14:02,734 --> 00:14:04,129
Scott: But the content was so good.

191
00:14:04,684 --> 00:14:04,850
Rym: Oh yeah.

192
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,150
Rym: 2005 I was working at IBM anyway.

193
00:14:07,511 --> 00:14:16,930
Scott: The content was so good then, but they didn't make a lot of content and obviously their format sucked, but they had good peoples together, uh, who are making that content.

194
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:19,890
Scott: And eventually, you know, they made really good stuff escapist.

195
00:14:20,231 --> 00:14:25,510
Scott: And then as they needed monies, they changed and changed and changed and changed and changed.

196
00:14:26,052 --> 00:14:28,530
Scott: And apparently it hasn't helped them because now they really need monies.

197
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:29,509
Scott: They're not doing well.

198
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:33,430
Scott: And they just got rid of, I think, I'm not sure exactly.

199
00:14:33,932 --> 00:14:38,770
Scott: It seems like they've gotten rid of all of their employees, all of paid people.

200
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:46,850
Scott: It says the majority of its paid staff, but the words that I heard where everyone except Yahtzee Crow Shaw is no longer on the, on the payroll.

201
00:14:49,892 --> 00:15:02,110
Scott: So yeah, I guess our IP escapist, I've, you know, you went downhill, I stopped paying attention to you a while ago, so I don't have any interesting though to know that something with such great roots, right?

202
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:08,968
Scott: Eventually, what very quickly became a large tree, then a large dead tree, then a large dead tree that fell in someone's house.

203
00:15:09,411 --> 00:15:11,290
Rym: So I had heard a bunch of rumblings.

204
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,990
Rym: I just googled for it and I found some articles.

205
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:21,930
Rym: I feel like I must, I must have gotten these rumblings from a bunch of sources, but it appears that escapist went way down the gamer gate hall.

206
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:23,628
Rym: Mm hmm.

207
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:29,550
Rym: Like there seems to be, it seems like the long decline accelerated a rapidly.

208
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:33,770
Scott: Well, I think, I think, you know, a lot of the people left and it's all different people from what it was before.

209
00:15:33,912 --> 00:15:35,090
Scott: Just took the property away.

210
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:41,070
Rym: I mean, a lot of people I know who worked or worked with them in any capacity bailed a long, long time.

211
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:46,829
Scott: Yeah, but I knew people who were there back in the good days doing good stuff and that's when it was good and I guess they all gone.

212
00:15:48,271 --> 00:15:55,990
Rym: It's interesting when these sorts of things happen, though, especially because unless you worked there, you never really know the inside story of like who was making hope.

213
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:58,429
Scott: And you always hope that years later someone will spill the tea.

214
00:15:59,071 --> 00:16:05,549
Rym: You know how you know where that tea gets spilled usually at some gaming con in a hotel room party like 10 years after the biz went down.

215
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:05,950
Scott: Yeah.

216
00:16:06,251 --> 00:16:12,910
Rym: So in like 10 years, we'll be at a mag fest or something and someone in a hotel party is going to be like, hey, remember, remember escapist?

217
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,010
Scott: Whoa, that thing.

218
00:16:14,175 --> 00:16:14,365
Scott: Yeah.

219
00:16:14,512 --> 00:16:15,170
Scott: What happened to that?

220
00:16:15,251 --> 00:16:16,489
Scott: I'll tell you the real deal.

221
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:16,830
Rym: Yeah.

222
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:18,950
Rym: Guy came in with a gun and shit went crazy.

223
00:16:19,815 --> 00:16:20,750
Scott: I don't think that's what happened.

224
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:23,750
Scott: But yeah, we can't promise.

225
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:24,110
Scott: Let's see.

226
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:25,110
Scott: I'm not going to read part of it.

227
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:25,483
Scott: Let's see.

228
00:16:25,954 --> 00:16:26,970
Scott: It's a serious situation.

229
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,790
Scott: We can't promise the escapist last forever.

230
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:31,330
Scott: It may have years left in it or it may disappear tomorrow.

231
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,870
Scott: We will do our utmost to keep the site running in an orderly fashion, whatever.

232
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:38,470
Scott: But they went so high and they fell so far and that's why it's notable.

233
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:56,029
Scott: I hope that that old escapist content is out there somewhere so that if you're actually interested in that, it's probably like going to be really valuable for somebody to go and find that original escapist because they were like long, well-researched essays about gaming like they were fantastic.

234
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:11,759
Rym: But anyway, things of the day, this video is not perfect, but it is a pretty good, succinct explanation of something that I actually know a lot about.

235
00:17:12,601 --> 00:17:18,819
Rym: And when I way back when I was playing Doom before when I was in high school, I was really big into modding Doom.

236
00:17:19,402 --> 00:17:28,198
Rym: So I used all those tools and I made levels and I made mods and I was fucking around with the code and I know a lot about line depth and side depth and how the textures worked and everything.

237
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:36,840
Rym: But if you didn't know, Doom is not three dimensional and Wolfenstein 3D is even less three dimensional.

238
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:37,341
Rym: Oh, yeah.

239
00:17:37,942 --> 00:17:49,120
Rym: But the details of why Doom looked so much better than Wolfenstein from that perspective is a pretty interesting technical discussion.

240
00:17:49,220 --> 00:18:02,979
Rym: And this video is in a pretty good detail about the difference between ray casting and these other methods with sectors that Doom use and why Doom was able to look so utterly amazing and yet would literally run pretty well on a four eighty six.

241
00:18:04,342 --> 00:18:06,840
Scott: And this video is John Carmichael is really good at programming.

242
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,560
Scott: Yeah, that's like the thing he's good at.

243
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,819
Scott: He wasn't good at making games.

244
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,740
Scott: That's why I like remember like what was a game rage or something?

245
00:18:12,942 --> 00:18:14,300
Scott: Oh, yeah, it was like super garbage.

246
00:18:14,582 --> 00:18:14,864
Scott: Right.

247
00:18:14,884 --> 00:18:17,039
Scott: But it's like he's just really good at programming.

248
00:18:17,401 --> 00:18:19,800
Scott: That's why is that he's able to do stuff like that.

249
00:18:19,941 --> 00:18:22,039
Scott: But, you know, that's the only skill he's got.

250
00:18:22,381 --> 00:18:25,955
Rym: Yeah, but basically Wolfenstein used this ray casting thing where it would cast.

251
00:18:26,918 --> 00:18:30,840
Rym: the engine would basically cast rays to figure out what pixel to display somewhere.

252
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:39,400
Rym: And because that is a performance and performance bottleneck, you couldn't have walls that were at more than 90 degree angles.

253
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,360
Rym: You couldn't have things that were different z heights.

254
00:18:41,761 --> 00:18:44,279
Rym: There's a reason why Wolfenstein is so blocky.

255
00:18:44,981 --> 00:18:47,494
Rym: Doom, you can have walls and angles and she can be real high up in the air.

256
00:18:47,977 --> 00:18:51,531
Rym: because Doom just had it was still 2D, but it had this third variable.

257
00:18:51,571 --> 00:18:57,700
Rym: that was like literally how high should we render this thing and the way it did that.

258
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,097
Scott: And you could go upstairs, too.

259
00:18:59,401 --> 00:19:01,820
Scott: So it wasn't just showing you things being high.

260
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,879
Scott: It was also like actually elevating you.

261
00:19:04,762 --> 00:19:07,914
Scott: You could fall down off of something down into the green slime.

262
00:19:07,954 --> 00:19:15,299
Rym: that was, you know, but the flat green slime floor, as you might have noticed when you play Doom, nothing could ever be on top of any other thing.

263
00:19:15,482 --> 00:19:16,360
Scott: They could be an elevator.

264
00:19:16,643 --> 00:19:17,313
Rym: No, you couldn't.

265
00:19:18,043 --> 00:19:19,219
Rym: Elevators didn't actually move.

266
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,938
Rym: Nothing moved up and down.

267
00:19:22,584 --> 00:19:24,160
Rym: You could never be on top of another thing.

268
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,320
Scott: There were still elevators.

269
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,800
Rym: Anything under you was a floor that went down forever.

270
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,280
Scott: You could jump off of an elevated surface and land on an imp.

271
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,320
Rym: Yeah, but you could not jump off of something and land on another thing.

272
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,356
Rym: You could not be above another thing or below another thing.

273
00:19:37,722 --> 00:19:41,142
Rym: If you felt like you were below something that was actually a ceiling and there was nothing above it.

274
00:19:42,146 --> 00:19:46,600
Rym: So this video actually explains the details and it's only 11 minutes long and it's pretty good.

275
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:52,800
Scott: Anyway, so this is Twitter account called Magic the Giffening.

276
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:53,948
Rym: Holy shit.

277
00:19:53,968 --> 00:19:55,060
Rym: Did I not know about this?

278
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,639
Scott: I can't believe you didn't know until now.

279
00:19:56,741 --> 00:19:58,179
Scott: So this is a little bit old.

280
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:04,604
Scott: It's not that it's sort of recent, but not super recent because we haven't done GeekNights in a while.

281
00:20:04,905 --> 00:20:08,462
Scott: But basically what it does is it takes a magic card from Magic the Gathering.

282
00:20:08,863 --> 00:20:15,500
Scott: It cuts out the area of the card where the art is and it uses supposedly machine learning of some kind.

283
00:20:15,601 --> 00:20:16,879
Scott: Or it could be just like Giffy.

284
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:17,823
Scott: I don't fucking know.

285
00:20:17,843 --> 00:20:23,665
Scott: It could be anything, but it finds a gift from the Internet to put in that spot.

286
00:20:24,207 --> 00:20:26,760
Scott: And sometimes it is not so good at choosing something.

287
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:30,040
Scott: It picks something weird that doesn't even make sense and is not funny or anything.

288
00:20:30,841 --> 00:20:46,800
Scott: But quite often it hits the nail on the head and creates a magic card with a hilarious animated gift that when juxtaposed with the completely unedited magic card around, it provides seconds of hilarity and it provides this multiple times a day.

289
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,039
Scott: Follow this Twitter account and enjoy.

290
00:20:49,221 --> 00:20:53,359
Scott: Even if you don't know anything about Magic the Gathering, it is funny for all.

291
00:20:55,727 --> 00:20:57,120
Rym: All right, I got to get away from this tab.

292
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,900
Rym: I'll be distracted in the moment.

293
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,360
Rym: The book club book, the fifth season.

294
00:21:01,743 --> 00:21:03,480
Rym: We're reviewing that on Thursday.

295
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,362
Rym: We're going to talk about it.

296
00:21:04,483 --> 00:21:15,900
Rym: So if you haven't read the fifth season yet, one, you spoil it and we're going to assume you already read it on this Thursday show on Thursday, October 26.

297
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,484
Scott: Ooh, spooky.

298
00:21:16,524 --> 00:21:20,180
Scott: You only have two days, maybe even one day, depending when you listen to this to read a whole book.

299
00:21:20,962 --> 00:21:23,460
Rym: It should only take you like a week to read this book.

300
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:33,280
Scott: Other upcoming things on Saturday, November 4th and 5th, which is the Sunday, there are going to be many things happening.

301
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,740
Scott: There's going to be Blizzcon is the third and fourth.

302
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:36,303
Rym: Oh, yeah.

303
00:21:36,403 --> 00:21:40,020
Scott: Which includes championships of your favorite Blizzard games or go there.

304
00:21:40,442 --> 00:21:47,821
Scott: The fourth and fifth, the same weekend is the Netrunner World Championships, along with a bunch of other Final Fantasy flight game championships no one cares about because they're not.

305
00:21:47,861 --> 00:21:51,478
Scott: Netrunner X-Wing, I think is actually at a different time of the year.

306
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:57,199
Scott: And Gamer X East, which we will be going to for at least one day, I think.

307
00:21:58,082 --> 00:22:03,720
Rym: But we don't know if it's going to be the Saturday or the Sunday yet, because last year it was a great con, but it was right after the election.

308
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:10,860
Rym: And for a lot of reasons, a lot of people who had like who had paid left early and it was a very subdued situation.

309
00:22:11,702 --> 00:22:13,580
Rym: But the foundation of the con was great.

310
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,817
Scott: So this year I'm really looking forward to it.

311
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,299
Scott: It was very organized and such and such.

312
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:24,003
Rym: So once we know what day our panel is on, we will be at the con pretty much all day that day.

313
00:22:24,023 --> 00:22:28,227
Rym: And if you are also there, we will play games with you because it's just a gaming con.

314
00:22:28,247 --> 00:22:28,938
Rym: We're going to play games.

315
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:35,183
Scott: On Sunday the 5th, if I'm not at Gamer X East, that is the day of the New York City Marathon.

316
00:22:35,544 --> 00:22:50,205
Scott: And what you can do, which is not it's not an authorized event in any way, but you can go to the start of the marathon down in South Brooklyn, just on this side of the Verrazano Bridge at the crackety crack, crack, crack, crack as a dawn before the marathon starts to

317
00:22:50,225 --> 00:22:50,908
Rym: get up pretty early

318
00:22:52,032 --> 00:22:54,121
Scott: and you can ride your bicycle along the route.

319
00:22:54,804 --> 00:22:58,280
Scott: I guess you could try to run the marathon or walk, but good luck with that.

320
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:02,880
Scott: Yeah, you can ride your bicycle along the route and get almost to the finish line.

321
00:23:03,701 --> 00:23:06,943
Scott: They don't let you to the actual finish line because, you know, it's like a secure whatever.

322
00:23:07,003 --> 00:23:10,120
Scott: But anyway, and then find a way to get home because the bridge is closed.

323
00:23:11,662 --> 00:23:17,044
Rym: I remember last year I bailed right at the bridge so I could go home before that happened anyway.

324
00:23:18,388 --> 00:23:27,104
Scott: But yeah, if I'm not doing something else, I'll probably do that again because it was depending on the weather to write, you know, OK, other things that are coming up.

325
00:23:27,165 --> 00:23:29,875
Rym: Hacks Unplugged is real soon.

326
00:23:29,895 --> 00:23:34,006
Scott: That is going to be November 16th, 17th and 18th and 19th in Pennsylvania.

327
00:23:37,322 --> 00:23:39,318
Scott: We're enforcing and we're doing an event.

328
00:23:39,862 --> 00:23:40,124
Rym: Yup.

329
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:41,739
Rym: From three thirty to five thirty p.m.

330
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:42,703
Rym: on Saturday.

331
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:45,914
Rym: We're going to give a lecture.

332
00:23:45,994 --> 00:23:51,580
Rym: that's kind of like our play dirty to win panel, but pretty much just focused on fucking people over in Carcassonne.

333
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,440
Scott: Teach you how to play Carcassonne, how to win at Carcassonne, and then you're all going to play Carcassonne and see who wins.

334
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:01,343
Scott: It's going to be real interesting to see who wins when everyone knows all the secrets of how to win.

335
00:24:01,564 --> 00:24:05,425
Rym: It's like battle bots and we're making the bots and then making them fight with each other.

336
00:24:05,525 --> 00:24:06,249
Scott: It's like giving.

337
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:10,657
Scott: it's like giving all these people like plus ten magic swords and then having them swing about each other.

338
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:11,863
Scott: It's going to be great.

339
00:24:12,225 --> 00:24:13,008
Rym: I'm really also.

340
00:24:13,089 --> 00:24:15,921
Rym: it's a tabletop packs like that my whole life.

341
00:24:15,981 --> 00:24:23,680
Scott: That same weekend in New York City at the Javits is Anime NYC, which we would go to if it were not also PAX Unplugged the same weekend.

342
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:28,020
Rym: I think anyway, NYC might be sold out or almost sold out now.

343
00:24:28,761 --> 00:24:28,923
Scott: Really?

344
00:24:29,328 --> 00:24:30,440
Scott: That is fascinating.

345
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,638
Scott: I guess it's worth going to.

346
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:38,102
Rym: Yeah, I like we said we would we would be there if PAX Unplugged weren't at the same time.

347
00:24:38,162 --> 00:24:38,463
Scott: All right.

348
00:24:38,504 --> 00:24:44,588
Scott: And then if you can make it to next year, the first week of next year, you have New Year's, then you've got.

349
00:24:44,648 --> 00:24:49,220
Scott: the next weekend is Magfest and the weekend after that is Pac South.

350
00:24:50,062 --> 00:24:51,691
Scott: Oh, baby.

351
00:24:51,711 --> 00:24:53,240
Scott: Ah, that's the way to start the year.

352
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,920
Scott: If you're not starting a year like that, why live?

353
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:02,640
Rym: The only problem is that that's a twenty eighteen starter because, as you know, Scott and I sort of split up the duties of what we do for GeekNights.

354
00:25:02,882 --> 00:25:05,720
Rym: And one of the things I do is actually arrange all our shit at cons.

355
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:14,520
Rym: It's actually been somewhat trying to arrange gamer hacks, Pac South, Pac's unplugged and Magfest all at the same time.

356
00:25:14,581 --> 00:25:15,589
Rym: I thank the gods.

357
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:16,820
Rym: I'm not going to Pac's house.

358
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:17,774
Scott: I'm making the.

359
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:18,120
Scott: oh yeah.

360
00:25:18,261 --> 00:25:19,480
Scott: Pac's house is like this weekend.

361
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:19,961
Rym: I know.

362
00:25:20,223 --> 00:25:20,464
Scott: Right.

363
00:25:20,565 --> 00:25:22,094
Rym: There's the thread in the forums.

364
00:25:22,215 --> 00:25:23,100
Rym: rocking because I'm working.

365
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,499
Scott: Work on new panel right now.

366
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,123
Scott: I already started.

367
00:25:25,284 --> 00:25:26,169
Rym: Yeah, I put that.

368
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:28,262
Scott: I put I don't know when we're going to use this panel.

369
00:25:28,323 --> 00:25:30,660
Rym: I put a version of it in for Magfest because fuck it.

370
00:25:30,861 --> 00:25:33,260
Rym: OK, but I put it in as an invite panel.

371
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,219
Rym: So we might use it partly to get someone smart like Dr.

372
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,498
Rym: Hazard also on the panel.

373
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,279
Rym: We can have present and have to learn.

374
00:25:41,282 --> 00:25:45,126
Rym: And then you might we might learn some stuff we can incorporate in the final version of the panel anyway.

375
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,139
Rym: So, yeah, a lot of stuff coming up.

376
00:25:47,681 --> 00:25:54,220
Rym: I will pick the next book club book, but I'm going to defer a little bit because I actually want to read the rest of the fifth season trilogy.

377
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:58,820
Scott: And I feel like every time I pick a book club book, right.

378
00:25:58,881 --> 00:26:00,320
Scott: It's always the start of some series.

379
00:26:00,501 --> 00:26:04,044
Scott: And you go on to read the whole fucking thing because I want I haven't picked a series yet.

380
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:05,160
Rym: And that right.

381
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:09,480
Scott: And then when you pick a book club book, it's just like I picked a one off book.

382
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:12,460
Scott: I guess I'm just better at picking book club books and you and I'll pick it.

383
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,780
Rym: I'll pick a series book this time.

384
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,906
Rym: We'll see what happens.

385
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:17,140
Rym: Plus, Wheel of Time is a special case.

386
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,019
Rym: I'm still kind of shocked that I read that whole thing.

387
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,080
Scott: I don't know why you read the whole thing because now I know.

388
00:26:22,003 --> 00:26:23,799
Rym: I know literally everything one can know.

389
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,780
Scott: I can live and die and not regret not knowing everything.

390
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,859
Scott: I just want to know about the snake men because there's nothing to know.

391
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,979
Rym: Well, there's a little bit to know and I know it all.

392
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:31,922
Scott: OK, great.

393
00:26:32,183 --> 00:26:37,759
Rym: The problem is knowing any one thing in the wheel of time is useless unless you know all the other things.

394
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:38,820
Scott: I don't care about the other things.

395
00:26:39,121 --> 00:26:40,780
Rym: Yeah, you would because the other is dependent.

396
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:43,780
Rym: But anyway, the fifth season is real good and you should read it.

397
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:49,060
Rym: And if you have not read it yet, I'd recommend not listening to you on Thursday because we're going to assume you read it.

398
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,580
Rym: You're going to wonder why I keep talking about so much metamoment.

399
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,260
Rym: I'm like, yeah, let's get into it then.

400
00:26:54,541 --> 00:26:58,940
Rym: So we played this game at RevuCon called Space Cube.

401
00:26:59,481 --> 00:27:07,460
Rym: So this game is called Sidereal Confluence, Trading and Negotiation in the Elysian Quadrant.

402
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:18,660
Scott: Now, the story that was told to me about this game, I don't know if it's true or not, but I totally believe it is that someone was trying to make a big four or five X game like, you know, Master of Orion Eclipse situation.

403
00:27:19,564 --> 00:27:21,260
Scott: And they ended up making so much game.

404
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:29,300
Scott: But then in the revision phase, they wisely trimmed away because that's what makes things good is remove all and remove all the cruft.

405
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,120
Scott: And so you get the pure magical essence.

406
00:27:31,623 --> 00:27:49,240
Scott: And apparently they removed everything from the game, the combat, everything except for this one part of the game where you deal with space trading of cubes and machines and stuff and this free trading mechanic and removed all the other parts of the game.

407
00:27:49,521 --> 00:27:55,560
Rym: So on the super, super high level, everyone has a unique asymmetric character with its own nonsense.

408
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:55,881
Scott: Right.

409
00:27:55,901 --> 00:28:01,420
Scott: So I got handed this big old card that looked like a race from like, you know, a game like Master of Orion.

410
00:28:01,641 --> 00:28:05,867
Scott: And I'm like reading all this text and I'm like, oh, my God, why do I have to play this?

411
00:28:05,948 --> 00:28:08,020
Scott: I don't want to let this be a video game.

412
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,159
Scott: I don't want to learn all this while you're reading it.

413
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,300
Rym: So I flip mine over.

414
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:18,903
Rym: And what I saw on the other side actually terrified me because there was way more shit back there and it looked like game mechanics.

415
00:28:19,144 --> 00:28:23,020
Scott: Yeah, but I'm reading this card and I'm like, why these stupid nerds?

416
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,940
Scott: I can't play nerdy games like this anymore.

417
00:28:25,181 --> 00:28:25,760
Scott: I'm not in high school.

418
00:28:25,981 --> 00:28:29,739
Rym: The thing I see is that the game starts getting unpacked, all these cards start coming out.

419
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,820
Scott: There's like a million cards with a million symbols and a pile of cubes.

420
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,018
Scott: And I'm like, oh, my God.

421
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:40,000
Rym: And the fascinating thing about this game and before we move any further, it wasn't bad.

422
00:28:40,021 --> 00:28:40,719
Rym: I had a good time with it.

423
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,680
Rym: Like, don't think that we're about to say this game is bad.

424
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,180
Scott: No, I'm just telling you what I was feeling at the time as a chronology.

425
00:28:46,421 --> 00:28:48,379
Rym: But when I looked at the cards.

426
00:28:49,923 --> 00:28:51,980
Rym: It looked like ridiculous bullshit.

427
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:58,100
Scott: The graphic design has much to be desired and it makes it look like a scary game.

428
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:03,060
Rym: And like the thing is, it is a scary game, but not nearly as scary as it appears to be.

429
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,579
Scott: No, that's the thing I'm trying to get at.

430
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:08,960
Scott: is the game looks way scarier than it really is.

431
00:29:09,521 --> 00:29:26,539
Scott: If it had a graphic design makeover and shrunk those alien race cards to be a bit smaller because they don't need to be that big and remove some of its heritage of being a space game, that was about four X or whatever, you would actually be able to see what this game is.

432
00:29:26,801 --> 00:29:29,300
Scott: You know, you can't judge this game by the cover, right?

433
00:29:29,744 --> 00:29:34,740
Scott: If you made it so you could judge it by the cover, then all those feelings from the start of it would go away.

434
00:29:34,882 --> 00:29:39,320
Scott: And you just have the reality of it, which is it's a lot like just a free trading game.

435
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:42,738
Scott: You trade stuff for stuff and see who gets the most victory points at the end.

436
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:43,585
Scott: That's it.

437
00:29:43,928 --> 00:29:45,219
Scott: That's really all there is to it.

438
00:29:45,541 --> 00:29:57,124
Rym: So thus the very fascinating things about this game was that once we learn the core mechanics, which took a while, I'm very much reminded of the concept of naive art.

439
00:29:57,485 --> 00:30:03,699
Rym: when there is a known craft with its own sort of assumptions and best practices like knitting or whatever.

440
00:30:04,345 --> 00:30:25,779
Rym: So it is entirely possible for someone who has never studied knitting, never read a knitting book, but has simply enjoyed the knitting of others and just started on their own learning how to knit, they might make perfectly great things, but they might do things in ways that would seem weird to someone who has more like domain knowledge of the craft.

441
00:30:26,142 --> 00:30:29,100
Scott: Yeah, because they don't know they're not learning from the past.

442
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,259
Scott: They're just trying to learn on their own and rediscovering everything that has already been learned.

443
00:30:33,884 --> 00:30:42,680
Rym: And I don't know if that's what happened with this game, but quote naive art is any form of visual art that is created by a person who lacks the formal education and training the professional undergoes, blah, blah, blah.

444
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,078
Scott: But it feels like that's what this game is.

445
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:56,240
Rym: In the sense that the mechanics it has are not that far from mechanics that I am well used to in just my general board gaming experience.

446
00:30:56,622 --> 00:31:00,460
Rym: And anyone who plays euro games has encountered time and time again.

447
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:11,780
Rym: But the way they are presented, the way they are explained, the proper nouns, all those things made them alien to me until it was explained.

448
00:31:12,561 --> 00:31:21,979
Rym: The things are not called what I expect them to be called mechanics that I would expect to be explained simply or explained in great depth, but end up being the simple mechanic I didn't expect them to be.

449
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,298
Rym: Things like that.

450
00:31:24,301 --> 00:31:34,960
Rym: The other fascinating thing is that this game, the individual cards, like the player boards, give very specific advice on how you should play that character.

451
00:31:35,442 --> 00:31:37,220
Scott: And it was very not right advice.

452
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:45,380
Rym: Well, mine was actually pretty much extremely right, because all mine said was you're going to have this one machine out fucking use it as much as possible.

453
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:45,864
Scott: Oh, OK.

454
00:31:45,884 --> 00:31:47,140
Scott: That's an advice you could actually follow.

455
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:47,943
Rym: So you know what I did?

456
00:31:48,587 --> 00:31:56,040
Rym: I did nothing but get the cubes to fuel that machine and make sure that I fueled it every single round, no matter what.

457
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,260
Scott: So basically, so here's how the game works.

458
00:31:58,381 --> 00:31:58,623
Scott: Right.

459
00:31:58,744 --> 00:32:04,300
Scott: Is you basically have these cards and each card is a machine and it has a cube that goes in and cubes that come out.

460
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:07,919
Scott: So you have a. I'm just going to make up a machine off my head because I can't see any right now.

461
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:14,400
Scott: I'm looking for one blue cube comes in and purple cube and a victory point come out.

462
00:32:14,461 --> 00:32:15,619
Scott: That's actually a way good machine.

463
00:32:15,901 --> 00:32:18,380
Scott: It's like, you know, this victory point is rare.

464
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:18,682
Rym: Yeah.

465
00:32:18,702 --> 00:32:19,758
Scott: Victory point is super rare.

466
00:32:20,281 --> 00:32:26,380
Scott: There's big cubes which are medium rare, small cubes, which are super common, you know, and you have all these machines in front of you.

467
00:32:26,742 --> 00:32:30,560
Scott: And what you'd really like to do is use every machine, every turn.

468
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:35,400
Rym: That would be ideal because every machine outputs more than you put into it.

469
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:35,681
Scott: Yeah.

470
00:32:35,702 --> 00:32:38,359
Scott: There's no machine that is not beneficial to run.

471
00:32:39,001 --> 00:32:39,283
Scott: Right.

472
00:32:39,544 --> 00:32:44,639
Scott: So you want to run every machine you can to basically increase your economy, get more stuff.

473
00:32:45,103 --> 00:32:46,779
Scott: If you have more stuff, you can do more stuff.

474
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,159
Scott: If you can do more stuff, you can get more victory points and win.

475
00:32:49,626 --> 00:32:49,891
Scott: All right.

476
00:32:50,055 --> 00:32:50,259
Scott: Yeah.

477
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:55,743
Scott: Also, every round you're going to produce a bunch of cubes from these planets you have.

478
00:32:55,945 --> 00:32:57,600
Scott: They just spit out cubes for nothing.

479
00:32:58,661 --> 00:33:01,600
Scott: Also, every round is the sequence where you can.

480
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,079
Rym: I think I had some planets that I actually had to put a cube on.

481
00:33:04,581 --> 00:33:04,788
Scott: Really?

482
00:33:04,892 --> 00:33:05,100
Scott: I didn't.

483
00:33:05,804 --> 00:33:07,420
Scott: Uh, anyway, I think I did anyway.

484
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,540
Rym: I kind of remember this game was so I got to look at my phone.

485
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,799
Rym: I took pictures of my board.

486
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:18,660
Scott: Anyway, there's also a phase everywhere where you secretly do a simultaneous reveal of stuff to try to win new planets with ships or something.

487
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:19,061
Rym: Yeah.

488
00:33:19,121 --> 00:33:21,779
Rym: There was a moderate amount of drama there that I actually did enjoy, too.

489
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:22,178
Rym: Yeah.

490
00:33:23,341 --> 00:33:31,120
Scott: But in the end, it's the main part of the game is there is a phase in which you freely trade stuff with everybody.

491
00:33:31,504 --> 00:33:33,140
Scott: You can make deals for the future.

492
00:33:33,461 --> 00:33:37,500
Scott: You can do a completely free trading, even more than traders of Genoa.

493
00:33:37,781 --> 00:33:41,660
Scott: You can just trade whatever you can feel like multiplayer trades.

494
00:33:41,781 --> 00:33:43,740
Rym: Like, yeah, I'll give you four cubes.

495
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:47,700
Rym: You can let each of you give me one of these cubes and then you can trade planets.

496
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:50,859
Scott: You can lend someone a machine for a turn that you then get back.

497
00:33:51,041 --> 00:33:54,700
Scott: You can there's a one character as wild cubes that no one else has.

498
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:55,959
Scott: They can trade those.

499
00:33:56,462 --> 00:33:58,039
Scott: It's like you can trade your ships.

500
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,959
Rym: What's funny is no one wanted his wild cubes like no one needed them.

501
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:04,080
Scott: You can trade friggin anything for anything.

502
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:09,938
Scott: So you basically what you do is you assign all the cubes you have to your machines to say, aha, this is how many machines I can run.

503
00:34:10,322 --> 00:34:12,400
Scott: Then you look and you say, well, I could run that machine.

504
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:18,420
Scott: If I had one more blue cube, you look at the cubes you're not using and you say, hey, who wants to trade me a blue cube for these cubes?

505
00:34:18,501 --> 00:34:20,599
Scott: I'm not using and maybe someone else has a blue cube.

506
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:21,385
Scott: They're not using.

507
00:34:21,728 --> 00:34:26,078
Scott: And now both of you end up running more machines if you make the trade and so on.

508
00:34:28,042 --> 00:34:31,600
Scott: So every turn you're trying to make trades to run as many machines as you can.

509
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:34,580
Scott: And then you try to get stuff in the auctions and the buying phases.

510
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:44,440
Rym: So what you're actually trying to get, the only thing you are judged on in the end of these purple victory points, and there are not many ways to get them.

511
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,480
Scott: The main way to get them is to discover new sciences.

512
00:34:48,761 --> 00:34:49,860
Scott: And what are new sciences?

513
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,679
Scott: They're really just machines, right?

514
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,179
Scott: There's a stack of cards.

515
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,600
Rym: There's some weird mechanics around them.

516
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:55,404
Rym: Like they're there.

517
00:34:55,947 --> 00:35:02,840
Rym: If I was going to design a game like this, I would probably get rid of that and let it just be the core machines and not this somewhat complicated.

518
00:35:03,141 --> 00:35:06,980
Scott: Anyway, the way the most points is to basically discover these science cards.

519
00:35:07,141 --> 00:35:07,363
Scott: Right.

520
00:35:07,403 --> 00:35:12,479
Scott: And when you discover a science, you get this new machine because you discovered some science and then you get to use it.

521
00:35:12,882 --> 00:35:16,560
Scott: And then the next turn, everyone else gets that machine, too.

522
00:35:17,343 --> 00:35:17,544
Scott: Right.

523
00:35:17,585 --> 00:35:22,740
Scott: So you get the exclusive right to use it for a turn and then everyone else gets to start using it to turn after.

524
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:27,559
Scott: However, that might not seem like, well, why would I discover this science if everyone else gets to use it?

525
00:35:27,661 --> 00:35:28,859
Scott: Well, just one turn later.

526
00:35:29,162 --> 00:35:31,020
Scott: Well, using it for the one turn is beneficial.

527
00:35:31,481 --> 00:35:34,440
Scott: But being the discoverer, you got a shit ton of victory points.

528
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,865
Rym: Now, what do we say?

529
00:35:35,885 --> 00:35:39,400
Rym: Shit, like five victory points is a big goddamn deal.

530
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,364
Scott: You got a lot of points.

531
00:35:40,425 --> 00:35:45,600
Rym: if you discover you'll have turns where you have like 20 cubes in front of you churning around.

532
00:35:46,002 --> 00:35:50,705
Rym: And the output of all that nonsense is like two victory points and you're very happy with yourself.

533
00:35:50,785 --> 00:35:57,900
Scott: The other thing is that to discover these sciences, you need to have a lot of cubes that are very and are all the same kind.

534
00:35:58,001 --> 00:36:02,483
Scott: And that is hard to do because you crank all your machines and they spit out a pile of cubes.

535
00:36:02,845 --> 00:36:06,285
Scott: But those cubes are going to be all sorts of different funny colors all over the place.

536
00:36:06,326 --> 00:36:07,880
Rym: You know, there's making a lot of green cubes.

537
00:36:08,382 --> 00:36:10,299
Scott: I like to get at some of the sciences.

538
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,619
Scott: It was like you need 12 blue cubes.

539
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,655
Scott: And I'm like, oh, I got a 10 and no one's going to trade me any.

540
00:36:15,876 --> 00:36:17,749
Scott: like I was about to get someone to trade me one.

541
00:36:17,769 --> 00:36:19,040
Scott: And they're like, wait a minute.

542
00:36:19,902 --> 00:36:22,927
Scott: And they didn't trade me because they saw that I would basically win the game if they did that.

543
00:36:22,988 --> 00:36:23,499
Scott: And they were right.

544
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:23,881
Rym: Yep.

545
00:36:23,922 --> 00:36:29,420
Rym: So that's the the only real problem I have with this game, because, again, the naive aspect doesn't really bother me.

546
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,579
Rym: That's just sort of fascinating, but because the game was good.

547
00:36:33,141 --> 00:36:45,280
Rym: But when we played it, the machine management itself, the solo game of manage my machine, even if there was no trading, is actually pretty complex and interesting in its own right.

548
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,003
Scott: There are also.

549
00:36:46,023 --> 00:36:50,579
Scott: the one interesting thing is that some machines, including your starting ones, could be upgraded.

550
00:36:51,664 --> 00:36:51,848
Scott: Right.

551
00:36:51,868 --> 00:36:52,380
Scott: So, oh, yeah.

552
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:55,280
Scott: That mechanic you try to get you can get victory points for doing that, too.

553
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:59,520
Rym: It's like I don't like burn a science and upgrade in order to in order to upgrade mine.

554
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:04,740
Scott: I needed forest planets to like devour and I was trying to get people to trade me forest.

555
00:37:05,081 --> 00:37:06,799
Rym: And I had a ton of them, but you wouldn't give me enough cubes.

556
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,438
Scott: I could didn't have enough cubes.

557
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:11,420
Rym: Well, that was going to give you my forest planet that gave me free green cubes.

558
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:12,221
Scott: Yeah.

559
00:37:12,723 --> 00:37:21,062
Scott: But, you know, you see the idea here and this the board, my starting suggestion seemed to imply that people would totally trade me those and they totally wouldn't know the science.

560
00:37:21,102 --> 00:37:33,940
Rym: upgrade pads are sort of interesting in that they they give you another route to sort of optimize and build your own world and adjust to the semi randomness that might be coming at you from other players.

561
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:44,819
Scott: The other thing is that when you start discovering lots of sciences or other players discover lots of sciences, some of those machines, the sciences can be upgraded by discarding other ones.

562
00:37:44,961 --> 00:37:47,779
Scott: So it's like it's like I'll give up this machine I never use.

563
00:37:48,202 --> 00:37:50,640
Scott: And that allows me to flip over this machine and make it better.

564
00:37:50,962 --> 00:37:54,240
Rym: I upgraded all of my starting machines because I had these weird like double machines.

565
00:37:54,520 --> 00:38:00,160
Scott: I wanted to because I gave a ton of victory points, but I was only able to do like two out of four, I think, because people wouldn't trade me there.

566
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:05,560
Rym: I upgraded mine because it basically like I started spitting out more medium cubes, which is free medium cubes all over the place.

567
00:38:05,901 --> 00:38:06,864
Rym: Yeah.

568
00:38:07,205 --> 00:38:20,024
Scott: My ability was that if I got a planet from the board, not from trading, but if I bought one in the auction, then basically I it would be a double planet and spit out double the cubes.

569
00:38:20,125 --> 00:38:24,439
Scott: And that was crazy, ridiculously powerful, which is why I was trying to win a planet every single turn.

570
00:38:24,701 --> 00:38:24,982
Rym: Yeah.

571
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:29,762
Scott: However, my ships were like half power or something because I was the plant people.

572
00:38:30,103 --> 00:38:33,679
Scott: So I had to get tons of ships and trades with people and then spend them all.

573
00:38:33,981 --> 00:38:39,105
Rym: See, the machine I kept cranking that it told me crank, it gave me a ton of ships every time I cranked it.

574
00:38:39,507 --> 00:38:43,599
Rym: So I always had a bunch of ships and pretty much get whatever I wanted anyway.

575
00:38:43,981 --> 00:38:48,119
Rym: So the other really interesting thing is, remember, we said that the game gives very specific advice to the players.

576
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,640
Rym: The game gives up.

577
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:57,120
Rym: I've never seen a game give this detail of helpful directional heuristics.

578
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,479
Scott: It was like a strategy guide.

579
00:38:58,861 --> 00:39:02,020
Rym: So on every machine, there'll be a ratio.

580
00:39:02,301 --> 00:39:12,759
Rym: It'll be like three to four or three to five or one to two or three and a half to four or three and three quarters to four.

581
00:39:13,501 --> 00:39:22,497
Rym: The game basically assigns an arbitrary value to everything that can be in the game, like every kind of cube and any machine.

582
00:39:23,725 --> 00:39:25,080
Rym: It'll give you this number.

583
00:39:25,281 --> 00:39:33,179
Rym: That is a pretty good heuristic or representation of in general how much value add the machine is in an abstract sense.

584
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:42,360
Rym: Also, on your little player help for four to seven machine is definitely giving you more bang for your buck than a six to seven machine.

585
00:39:42,601 --> 00:39:47,339
Scott: Also, on your player help card, there's a little chart that shows you what a fair trade generally is.

586
00:39:47,621 --> 00:39:52,080
Scott: It's like, oh, yeah, trading three small cubes is about equal to a medium cube.

587
00:39:52,221 --> 00:39:54,780
Scott: And like about two medium cubes is about equal.

588
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,779
Scott: It's like the fanciest octagon cube that I never had to use for.

589
00:39:58,262 --> 00:40:02,244
Scott: And it's like it takes you know, it's like about this many things is worth one victory point.

590
00:40:02,264 --> 00:40:04,660
Scott: It's like it tells you it is big, long strip.

591
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:05,806
Scott: What's equal?

592
00:40:05,907 --> 00:40:07,500
Scott: How many of what is equal to what?

593
00:40:07,961 --> 00:40:09,509
Scott: And that is so nobody.

594
00:40:09,811 --> 00:40:15,039
Scott: if you pay attention to that, you shouldn't be able to get ripped off because you know what values of things are instead of having to just guess.

595
00:40:15,321 --> 00:40:28,479
Scott: Yeah, like I see a lot of people that's good, I think, because first of all, I think you've got to avoid being trapped by that because there's times where it's like, well, I need to make this uneven trade because actually it pays out bigger for me because I can activate one more machine.

596
00:40:29,161 --> 00:40:36,499
Scott: But also a lot of people who play games with open trading have no idea how to value things at all when there's just free valuing.

597
00:40:36,761 --> 00:40:40,561
Rym: Now, if it's a relatively simple game, figuring that out is one of the skills of the game.

598
00:40:40,601 --> 00:40:44,080
Rym: I feel like if I had to figure that out, I just wouldn't trade it with anyone.

599
00:40:44,382 --> 00:40:45,939
Rym: Maybe this game's got so much going on.

600
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:51,239
Scott: Yeah, but it's like, you know, people who play games with just like where they have to value things on their own.

601
00:40:51,803 --> 00:40:53,259
Scott: A lot of people have trouble with that.

602
00:40:53,601 --> 00:41:00,120
Scott: So telling people what a fair trade is protects them from sharky good players trying to rip them off.

603
00:41:00,341 --> 00:41:11,780
Rym: I think that the majority of games of modern art I've ever played have had at least one player bid more money for a painting than it could possibly be worth in the best possible circumstances.

604
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:16,640
Rym: There is literally I can think of almost no reason you should ever do that.

605
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:23,900
Scott: It's like that painting, no matter what the draw is, if you get the perfect draw for the rest of the game, that painting will be worth 50.

606
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,300
Scott: Why are you bidding 60?

607
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,699
Scott: You're just losing ten dollars.

608
00:41:27,203 --> 00:41:27,978
Scott: Why would you do this?

609
00:41:28,341 --> 00:41:31,680
Rym: You're giving me an extra ten dollars for nothing.

610
00:41:31,884 --> 00:41:32,598
Rym: Are you sure?

611
00:41:33,242 --> 00:41:33,968
Rym: And they're always sure.

612
00:41:34,049 --> 00:41:35,260
Rym: They always think they got a good plan.

613
00:41:35,421 --> 00:41:37,008
Rym: I never understood why I don't.

614
00:41:37,129 --> 00:41:49,960
Rym: I don't get it, but I've never seen a game give this granular level of like base pricing or base heuristics embedded into the game and coupled with the player advice, which again is shockingly specific.

615
00:41:50,704 --> 00:41:51,618
Rym: I just don't know.

616
00:41:52,883 --> 00:41:54,960
Rym: I don't know how I feel about that in the long run.

617
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,999
Rym: I don't know if it's a good idea or a bad idea.

618
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:06,966
Rym: I don't know if it's a sign that maybe the game needs to be more elegant or if it's a way to take a messy game and make it playable with a smaller number of learning games.

619
00:42:07,329 --> 00:42:08,377
Rym: It's a complicated situation.

620
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:24,220
Scott: All I can say is that the name of this game and the graphic design of this game and the heritage of this game make it seem like a scary, scary, complicated for X space game when in reality it's just a game where you trade cubes, put them in a machine to get more cubes as efficiently as possible to get more cubes.

621
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,179
Scott: And hopefully you have the most victory cubes at the end of the game.

622
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:30,300
Scott: And it's a really straightforward kind of game.

623
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:39,146
Scott: If you like trading with people and bargaining, then this is the game for you, especially if you like wooden cubes and an outer space theme and asymmetry, a little bit of asymmetry.

624
00:42:39,529 --> 00:42:41,160
Scott: This game could be way fun for you.

625
00:42:41,261 --> 00:42:42,559
Scott: It's like, hey, it's not bad.

626
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:50,838
Scott: But I think if they fix the graphic design and maybe reduced some of the text on the cards, it would actually be much more approachable.

627
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,326
Scott: So don't be you got to.

628
00:42:53,788 --> 00:43:05,001
Rym: you know, if you're really in the mood for trading trades of Genoa or this, it's hard to say, though, because at the same time, a lot of the clutter on the cards is things like showing you what's on the back of a card that could be flipped.

629
00:43:05,162 --> 00:43:05,423
Scott: Yep.

630
00:43:05,945 --> 00:43:12,920
Rym: Or that heuristic, which I feel like without the heuristic, it would take a couple of plays before you could actually play the game.

631
00:43:14,324 --> 00:43:14,585
Rym: Yep.

632
00:43:14,605 --> 00:43:27,359
Rym: So the other real problem is that if the game is primarily about trading among our group, which was all like super savvy, sharp players, no one was willing to trade unless they were fucking ripping someone off in most cases, which is how we do.

633
00:43:28,141 --> 00:43:30,020
Rym: So there wasn't that much trading.

634
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:30,240
Rym: Right.

635
00:43:30,301 --> 00:43:36,559
Rym: I would I would always like almost always, if I couldn't get a good trade, I'd just say fuck it and work on my machine.

636
00:43:37,461 --> 00:43:44,400
Rym: And Matt gave some good feedback that by the time he had optimized his machine and knew what he wanted to do to trade, everyone else was done trading.

637
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:45,262
Rym: It didn't care anymore.

638
00:43:45,383 --> 00:43:52,920
Rym: I just know that I feel like it's more that the machine and the trading are both equal cognitive loads.

639
00:43:54,221 --> 00:44:02,722
Rym: And unless everyone in the group sets the balance between the two in terms of how they spend their term at around the same place, either some people are never going to get to trade.

640
00:44:02,742 --> 00:44:08,389
Scott: I think his cognitive load was bigger because his cubes were wild, whereas I drew mine was just like, oh, I have.

641
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:14,220
Scott: I went basically went down each machine in order of efficiency and power and was like, can I power this one?

642
00:44:14,502 --> 00:44:15,999
Scott: Yes, I have the cubes for that assigned.

643
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:23,080
Scott: I just went down until, well, I can't possibly power any more machines and I can't possibly get more efficiency out of the machines.

644
00:44:23,441 --> 00:44:27,240
Scott: Let's look at the what I have left and try to trade it to get ships and whatever I need.

645
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:27,763
Rym: See, I would.

646
00:44:27,883 --> 00:44:31,717
Rym: I would look from the perspective of here are things I want to do and here are things I like to do.

647
00:44:32,241 --> 00:44:36,385
Rym: And I would make a short note in my head of the kinds of cubes I need to do the things I'd like to do.

648
00:44:36,405 --> 00:44:38,560
Rym: And I wouldn't actively try to trade with people.

649
00:44:38,966 --> 00:44:39,639
Rym: I would listen.

650
00:44:40,081 --> 00:44:46,300
Rym: And if I heard anyone say the type of cube that I needed for the thing I'd like to do, I would look up and try to make a deal.

651
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,199
Rym: But otherwise, I ignored what everyone else was doing.

652
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:54,300
Rym: And then I had a second bucket of things I had to do and I can't do with my machine.

653
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:58,840
Rym: And that was the only time I would actually go up and say, anyone got any green cubes?

654
00:44:59,802 --> 00:45:03,600
Rym: I need green cubes, anyone, any Bueller, anyone.

655
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,042
Rym: But I do.

656
00:45:05,122 --> 00:45:15,899
Rym: I do feel like a problem is if I were trying to play this game more seriously, there's another thing I'd have to take into account, which is the thing you take into account in every other game that allows trading.

657
00:45:17,144 --> 00:45:18,620
Rym: How close is Scott to winning?

658
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:19,101
Rym: Yeah.

659
00:45:19,382 --> 00:45:20,206
Rym: How many points does?

660
00:45:20,267 --> 00:45:22,800
Scott: it is very difficult to track the positional heuristic.

661
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:29,546
Scott: I wanted to sort of spread my trades evenly in the game so that way I wouldn't benefit anyone else more.

662
00:45:29,586 --> 00:45:35,200
Scott: Because when you trade with someone and it's you're not getting ripped off, you're basically boosting the two of you ahead of all the other players.

663
00:45:35,641 --> 00:45:41,100
Scott: So if I trade with everyone evenly, I'm boosting myself, boost, boost four times because four other players, but that's not enough.

664
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:41,723
Rym: You got to pay attention.

665
00:45:41,743 --> 00:45:42,728
Scott: They're getting boosted once.

666
00:45:42,808 --> 00:45:50,779
Rym: each is Rym trading with Chris a lot, because if that's true, you don't want to trade with Chris at all, probably, because then if you spread evenly, Chris is still plus one.

667
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:53,431
Rym: Yeah, but there's almost there's.

668
00:45:53,451 --> 00:45:55,762
Rym: I don't think there's any way for a human to keep track of that.

669
00:45:55,802 --> 00:45:58,780
Scott: I could not keep track of who had what points really at all.

670
00:45:58,900 --> 00:45:59,644
Scott: It was too hard.

671
00:45:59,926 --> 00:46:00,810
Scott: And plus you keep.

672
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:03,333
Scott: you get these victory point chips and keep them secret behind a shield.

673
00:46:03,557 --> 00:46:03,659
Scott: Yep.

674
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:11,181
Rym: So so what I wonder is the people who are deeply into this game and really focus on the trading.

675
00:46:12,023 --> 00:46:19,205
Rym: I wonder if they just trade more without considering the true ramifications of their trading.

676
00:46:19,225 --> 00:46:20,639
Scott: The victory points are behind a shield, too.

677
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:21,964
Rym: Yeah.

678
00:46:21,984 --> 00:46:36,359
Rym: Or are they perhaps the kinds of people who might be drawn to this kind of game or graphic design, the kinds of people who will let the game take six hours to ensure that they fully explore the trading and the machining on every turn?

679
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:43,880
Rym: Because this feels like the kind of game to where there are people who will play it for six hours and enjoy every minute of those six hours.

680
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,138
Scott: We played it much faster than that.

681
00:46:46,061 --> 00:46:51,228
Scott: I could be if we played it again, knowing the rules now, we could play it much, much faster than it looks like.

682
00:46:51,269 --> 00:46:52,640
Scott: It looks like a game that will take six hours.

683
00:46:52,741 --> 00:46:54,899
Scott: We could play it in like one hour and maybe a little more.

684
00:46:55,161 --> 00:46:56,066
Rym: I think hour and a half.

685
00:46:56,086 --> 00:46:58,922
Rym: We could crank this game out if everyone already knew how to play.

686
00:46:59,023 --> 00:47:01,680
Scott: And I didn't have to remember anything and such and such.

687
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:08,760
Rym: And everyone is willing to not try to track a true positional heuristic of all the other players because I don't think it's possible.

688
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:12,600
Rym: I wonder if you could make the trading more interesting.

689
00:47:12,921 --> 00:47:17,564
Rym: You couldn't really fully structure it because that'd be a very different game and it would probably take a lot longer.

690
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:36,362
Rym: But if there were some way to implicitly advertise trades, like if you had a set of boards, you could like just put in front of you, that's like, I want to trade this because I know if I could have looked up and seen advertised trades, that might have sped up my own turn instead of everyone yelling at each other all the time.

691
00:47:36,402 --> 00:47:36,603
Rym: But the

692
00:47:36,664 --> 00:47:50,800
Scott: one thing this game actually got me thinking about was not not you know, it's not something I think this game should do, but maybe for a different game is, you know, we just talked about the knowing who you're trading with because you don't want to boost the person who's in first along with yourself.

693
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,206
Scott: You want to trade with people below you.

694
00:47:52,287 --> 00:47:52,508
Scott: Right.

695
00:47:53,352 --> 00:47:58,072
Scott: Or even with you to boost up and catch up to the people who are ahead of you if you're not in first already.

696
00:47:58,313 --> 00:47:58,775
Scott: Yeah.

697
00:47:59,116 --> 00:48:03,733
Scott: Is a game where somehow you could trade but not know who you're trading with.

698
00:48:04,074 --> 00:48:10,904
Scott: You just see deals and you can make them or not make them based on their own merits, not knowing who's on the other end.

699
00:48:11,085 --> 00:48:12,653
Scott: And that, you know, just some kind of game.

700
00:48:12,774 --> 00:48:15,589
Scott: I'm sure there might be a game like that, but, you know, I've never played it.

701
00:48:15,971 --> 00:48:17,761
Scott: It would be cool if there was a game like that.

702
00:48:17,821 --> 00:48:23,586
Scott: Perhaps it could use some sort of market as a middleman to obfuscate the who you're trading with or something.

703
00:48:23,606 --> 00:48:39,053
Scott: Uh, and thus, you know, you wouldn't have this sort of like politics that would go in a game like that, but you still have all the fun of trading and making deals because you'd be like, all right, I'll trade three blue cubes for two greens and and it's no one knows it's you.

704
00:48:39,395 --> 00:48:50,782
Rym: And so anyone who's willing to trade two greens for three blues is look and sees that and it's like, but that does remove what a lot of people like about these kinds of free form trading games, which is the politics side.

705
00:48:50,843 --> 00:48:51,867
Rym: Yeah, the negotiation.

706
00:48:52,249 --> 00:48:53,695
Scott: Well, I think here's the thing.

707
00:48:53,736 --> 00:48:57,728
Scott: I think if you did this, you could somehow keep the negotiation right.

708
00:48:58,069 --> 00:49:07,183
Scott: But by making the recipient of the person offering the trade anonymous, I think you actually flip the negotiation to the other side, right?

709
00:49:07,223 --> 00:49:12,767
Scott: If I go to you in a game Rym and I say, hey, Rym, I see you got two greens, I'll trade you one blue for it.

710
00:49:12,807 --> 00:49:13,370
Scott: What do you do?

711
00:49:13,591 --> 00:49:14,816
Scott: You go, give me two blue.

712
00:49:14,837 --> 00:49:17,790
Scott: Yeah, because I'm the one asking and I'm asking you.

713
00:49:17,810 --> 00:49:20,562
Rym: Well, you kept saying, hey, anyone got any forest colonies?

714
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:21,446
Rym: I'm like, fuck you.

715
00:49:21,627 --> 00:49:21,968
Rym: Exactly.

716
00:49:21,988 --> 00:49:23,877
Rym: As I look at my five forest college.

717
00:49:23,938 --> 00:49:24,420
Rym: Exactly.

718
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:28,638
Scott: But now let's say let's make it suddenly anonymous with this market aspect, right?

719
00:49:28,659 --> 00:49:38,255
Scott: Where there's some sort of intermediary and all you see out is out on the board, the opportunity to trade those two greens for a blue and maybe someone else sees it, too.

720
00:49:38,676 --> 00:49:40,643
Scott: So suddenly no longer is it.

721
00:49:40,944 --> 00:49:43,655
Scott: I'm going to give Scott as little as I can for that blue I need.

722
00:49:43,756 --> 00:49:48,520
Scott: It's now I need to get that blue because someone else is going to take that deal off the board.

723
00:49:48,962 --> 00:49:54,287
Scott: And now you're suddenly putting three greens or four greens because someone else is going to put in three greens, right?

724
00:49:54,528 --> 00:50:05,986
Scott: So you just by taking away knowing who the recipient is, you can suddenly it's now more of an eBay situation and less of a give Scott as little as possible situation.

725
00:50:06,027 --> 00:50:06,469
Rym: That'd be easy.

726
00:50:06,569 --> 00:50:09,141
Rym: A video game that is very difficult to do in a physical game.

727
00:50:09,221 --> 00:50:10,766
Scott: Oh, yes, yes, yes, obviously.

728
00:50:11,047 --> 00:50:17,915
Rym: But that's why I wonder if some sort of player aid, like not a rule, like I don't want to add structure to this.

729
00:50:17,955 --> 00:50:19,623
Rym: I don't want it to be like Res Publica.

730
00:50:19,643 --> 00:50:22,953
Rym: We're like, I have two blue cubes.

731
00:50:23,294 --> 00:50:23,795
Scott: Yeah, no.

732
00:50:23,915 --> 00:50:24,738
Scott: Oh, Res Publica.

733
00:50:24,778 --> 00:50:25,199
Scott: That's right.

734
00:50:25,219 --> 00:50:27,385
Rym: I don't want that.

735
00:50:27,626 --> 00:50:29,512
Scott: Yeah, that was interesting, though.

736
00:50:29,552 --> 00:50:30,194
Scott: But yeah, not that.

737
00:50:30,395 --> 00:50:30,615
Rym: Yeah.

738
00:50:30,876 --> 00:50:53,644
Rym: But I really wonder if you put some soft mechanic where they were player aids like a pool of cards or cardboard things where you could basically advertise trades without having to keep yelling at everyone like you have a common area in the middle and I can just put like three advertised trades like I'm willing to trade blue cubes and I like here's three blue cubes and willing to trade.

739
00:50:53,664 --> 00:50:58,585
Scott: There is some physical mechanism for creating a trade advertisement and then you could shuffle them.

740
00:50:58,887 --> 00:50:59,871
Rym: Yeah, right.

741
00:50:59,911 --> 00:51:03,351
Scott: And then you've splay them out and you know which ones are yours because you made them.

742
00:51:03,612 --> 00:51:04,478
Rym: Oh, I don't even want to shove.

743
00:51:04,498 --> 00:51:07,775
Rym: I don't even care about the anonymous part because even better, you know what?

744
00:51:08,017 --> 00:51:10,107
Scott: Maybe some of them are yours and you know what?

745
00:51:10,147 --> 00:51:12,438
Scott: You shuffle them up and you splay them out, right?

746
00:51:12,458 --> 00:51:17,376
Scott: You accidentally trade yourself because I put down trade one blue for two green, right?

747
00:51:17,497 --> 00:51:17,758
Scott: Yeah.

748
00:51:17,818 --> 00:51:19,605
Scott: Maybe I want to turn a blue into two green.

749
00:51:19,686 --> 00:51:21,112
Scott: So I put it out there and then I use it.

750
00:51:22,318 --> 00:51:25,469
Scott: I make the deal with myself, but I guess, oh, but those are my two green.

751
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:26,953
Scott: Yeah.

752
00:51:27,034 --> 00:51:27,435
Scott: Nevermind.

753
00:51:28,358 --> 00:51:30,304
Rym: It's like buying your own stock through scotch ride.

754
00:51:30,324 --> 00:51:31,226
Rym: Like you're just paying $14 son.

755
00:51:31,266 --> 00:51:42,748
Rym: So, but indeed because it is impossible to keep a reasonable positional heuristic in this game on all the other players and you have to just sort of ignore that aspect.

756
00:51:43,371 --> 00:51:49,617
Rym: I feel like you can avoid the politics situation by just letting it wash over you and focusing on making good machine.

757
00:51:49,698 --> 00:51:51,727
Rym: That's what I did and focusing on good trades.

758
00:51:51,767 --> 00:51:52,289
Rym: That's what I did.

759
00:51:52,310 --> 00:52:03,795
Rym: But then to keep the spirit of the game instead of doing some structural change like you're talking about, just having physical implements to be able to advertise trades without having to yell constantly.

760
00:52:04,698 --> 00:52:07,347
Rym: That would make this game cleaner to play.

761
00:52:07,728 --> 00:52:15,476
Rym: The only problem with that is that there is no table on earth that will have enough free space for said trade advertisement pieces.

762
00:52:15,878 --> 00:52:17,244
Scott: This game has got a lot of stuff.

763
00:52:17,305 --> 00:52:18,330
Scott: It takes up a lot of room.

764
00:52:18,350 --> 00:52:19,335
Scott: You need a big table.

765
00:52:19,435 --> 00:52:21,485
Scott: There's going to be cubes everywhere.

766
00:52:21,545 --> 00:52:33,990
Rym: We were playing games on a table that was big enough for us, our group to play two separate giant games and yet a small game of sidereal nonsense literally covered every square inch of the table.

767
00:52:34,572 --> 00:52:38,146
Scott: Granted it was two, three player games and this was one five player game.

768
00:52:38,427 --> 00:52:43,866
Rym: I do not own or know of a game that I would be willing to play that takes up more table space than this game.

769
00:52:43,886 --> 00:52:47,520
Scott: I think Eclipse takes up more space than this.

770
00:52:48,844 --> 00:52:52,074
Rym: I think Eclipse might not actually take up more space than this.

771
00:52:52,094 --> 00:52:52,636
Scott: I think it does.

772
00:52:53,439 --> 00:52:53,860
Scott: Definitely.

773
00:52:54,601 --> 00:52:56,028
Rym: Maybe with the science area.

774
00:52:56,049 --> 00:52:58,059
Scott: Yeah, Eclipse definitely takes up more than this.

775
00:52:58,099 --> 00:53:04,194
Rym: Of course I remember the way we got around that is we put the science area on the other side of the room just like on it so you could walk on a second table.

776
00:53:04,214 --> 00:53:08,318
Scott: because Eclipse is so big this game doesn't need a second table, but this game, it's just all your shit.

777
00:53:08,358 --> 00:53:11,587
Rym: Like your, your splay will be all over the place.

778
00:53:11,627 --> 00:53:12,509
Scott: Yes, it was big.

779
00:53:14,053 --> 00:53:24,220
Rym: Uh, but yeah, I enjoyed this game despite not expecting to based on my initial impression, looking at the rules or the graphics.

780
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:24,561
Rym: Yup.

781
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:25,425
Rym: I would play it again.

782
00:53:25,445 --> 00:53:31,529
Scott: The art, the art that is there that is like not the graphic design, but the art, the drawings is way good.

783
00:53:31,749 --> 00:53:35,923
Rym: Also the art of the proper nouns as in the world.

784
00:53:35,943 --> 00:53:38,977
Rym: Uh, I'm not the kind of person who cares about that sort of thing.

785
00:53:38,997 --> 00:53:43,373
Rym: There is a lot of world building nonsense all over the place.

786
00:53:43,494 --> 00:53:50,454
Rym: Everything's got proper nouns, everything and the proper nouns are very proper nouny.

787
00:53:50,955 --> 00:54:09,093
Scott: Anyway, so yeah, if you're into, if you want free trading, a big pile of cubes, uh, you know, some sort of relatively hardcore ish board gaming and a relatively unique experience because I've never played a free form trading game that has this scale of nonsense to deal with.

788
00:54:09,194 --> 00:54:09,896
Scott: Then go for this.

789
00:54:10,016 --> 00:54:14,740
Scott: Otherwise don't go for this, but if you want to trade, you can play Bonanza or Traders of Genoa or something.

790
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:16,664
Rym: Bust this game out.

791
00:54:16,704 --> 00:54:29,012
Rym: If you've got friends who are a little bit bored of games like Traders of Genoa and have already played a lot of games, this is not a first baby's first board game by any stretch, but I do want to play it again.

792
00:54:29,032 --> 00:54:30,036
Rym: I will play it again.

793
00:54:30,056 --> 00:54:31,440
Scott: I might play it again.

794
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:33,222
Rym: I want to play it at least one more time.

795
00:54:33,502 --> 00:54:34,303
Scott: Sure, I could go.

796
00:54:34,483 --> 00:54:34,804
Scott: I could do.

797
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:43,000
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

798
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:48,199
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

Rym: We are, as you saw, slowly picking up the schedule again, and we have a huge queue of both Tuesday and Wednesday episodes of GeekNights, and we'll do something for Thursdays.

806
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:49,047
Rym: But anyway, I leave you with- It's just like us, we're all trick-or-treating for candy, just like us.

807
00:56:49,147 --> 00:56:49,448
Scott: Look.

808
00:56:49,508 --> 00:56:49,989
Scott: See?

809
00:56:50,349 --> 00:56:50,630
Scott: See?

810
00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:56,442
Scott: I'm no scaredy cat.

811
00:57:00,788 --> 00:57:15,640
Media: I may be lazy, I may be fat, I don't do laughs, and I do not chat, but I may be selfish, yeah, and all of that, but the one thing I'm not is a scaredy cat.

812
00:57:23,187 --> 00:57:38,020
Media: I may be bossy, I may lack grace, I don't do sit-ups to trim my waist, I may be thoughtless, yeah, and all of that, but the one thing I'm not is a scaredy cat.

813
00:57:45,522 --> 00:58:04,529
Media: I don't have charm or much pizzazz, I don't chase mice and all that jazz, I may be sassy, yes, and all of that, but the one thing I'm not, yeah, the one thing I'm not, I say the one thing I'm not is a scaredy cat.
