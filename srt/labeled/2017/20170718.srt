1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,454
Rym: It's Tuesday July 18th 2017.

2
00:00:10,454 --> 00:00:17,838
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight reviewing board games.

3
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:22,408
Rym: the way that we do it dog Let's do this.

4
00:00:23,335 --> 00:00:25,650
Rym: Yeah, so we wanted to actually review a board game.

5
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:31,872
Rym: We've been playing recently, but we haven't played it enough and this show instead will be about Why.

6
00:00:31,952 --> 00:00:36,890
Rym: that makes it hard to review a lot of board games like we used to in the I don't know like five years ago.

7
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:38,334
Scott: It's all you.

8
00:00:38,354 --> 00:00:40,709
Scott: yeah, it's your idea you're carrying it.

9
00:00:40,971 --> 00:00:44,770
Rym: Hey, it was my crab people and I admitted it was a crab people, but that's what I got for tonight.

10
00:00:44,954 --> 00:00:52,630
Rym: I got nothing But we'll probably be able to play that game enough to the next Tuesday show be able to talk about it Or maybe I'll just blow through night in the woods and then we can do a full show on that.

11
00:00:52,951 --> 00:00:53,574
Scott: You can also play.

12
00:00:53,594 --> 00:00:55,722
Scott: I'm gonna start playing chef II on the switch.

13
00:00:56,224 --> 00:00:57,850
Scott: Oh, yeah play that we could do a show.

14
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:58,432
Rym: I'll play that.

15
00:00:58,814 --> 00:01:00,359
Rym: I'll play the hell out of that cuz.

16
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,030
Rym: uh, I can't get past much in tumble seeds.

17
00:01:03,932 --> 00:01:06,106
Scott: They just made tumble seed easier, yeah, maybe I should.

18
00:01:06,146 --> 00:01:06,750
Rym: I get that update.

19
00:01:07,273 --> 00:01:09,969
Rym: I actually went back into breath of the wild and went and did a whole.

20
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,780
Scott: I'm gonna do that also.

21
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:15,769
Rym: I went and got a whole bunch of shrines that were like the weird hard-to-find ones.

22
00:01:16,171 --> 00:01:19,284
Scott: I'm gonna be doing that soon because the DLC updated and I paid for that.

23
00:01:19,545 --> 00:01:25,493
Rym: Yeah, my money's worth You know, I didn't get the DLC and the more I look at what it is I don't think I care.

24
00:01:25,714 --> 00:01:28,165
Scott: but I also get other DLCs that are coming later.

25
00:01:28,185 --> 00:01:29,090
Scott: I'd say it was a pack.

26
00:01:29,371 --> 00:01:30,718
Scott: This is this isn't all I'm getting.

27
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:32,750
Scott: I'm getting like a whole other dungeon later.

28
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:34,578
Rym: Yeah, I will see.

29
00:01:34,638 --> 00:01:38,549
Rym: I'm gonna wait and see if the dungeon is great because breath of the way I'm gonna pay more for that dungeon.

30
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:53,510
Rym: Yeah, breath of the wild was already like this really like perfect gaming experience and because I've sort of played it Through so hard that the incremental returns on playing it more actually pretty minimal even if there's more content.

31
00:01:53,871 --> 00:02:00,270
Scott: I'm just tempted because I was tempted because all the Zelda games right you play them you beat them and then they're so done.

32
00:02:00,932 --> 00:02:02,426
Rym: It's like well, but no breath of the wild.

33
00:02:02,446 --> 00:02:02,850
Rym: to your point.

34
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:08,759
Rym: Yeah cuz like I booted up the other day cuz I was like waiting for something to finish like I was doing a render and I was just like, huh?

35
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,789
Rym: I wonder what's over there?

36
00:02:10,292 --> 00:02:10,976
Rym: I don't have any like.

37
00:02:11,015 --> 00:02:13,569
Rym: there's not a lot of waypoints or things in that area of the map.

38
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:17,464
Rym: I wonder if there's something there and I just went to this part of the map.

39
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:19,010
Scott: It's like, you know, even a game.

40
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:19,934
Scott: That's so enormous.

41
00:02:19,954 --> 00:02:23,307
Scott: You still I'm still have covered a great amount of it.

42
00:02:23,368 --> 00:02:27,720
Rym: Yeah That's the last area I explored.

43
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,460
Rym: I explored the fuck out of that area So the tempt ate.

44
00:02:30,501 --> 00:02:38,450
Scott: my favorite area The temptation of a Zelda that keeps going is like the temptation of the netrunner where they adding more car.

45
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:44,110
Rym: Well, it's also because you're so powerful by the end of breath of the wild if you did all this stuff.

46
00:02:44,511 --> 00:02:50,007
Rym: They're walking around like this god-man with weapons of the ancients just like silver line out, whatever.

47
00:02:50,027 --> 00:02:51,010
Rym: He won't even touch me.

48
00:02:51,456 --> 00:02:52,773
Rym: Let's go, bro Mm-hmm.

49
00:02:53,195 --> 00:02:55,525
Rym: I didn't even upgrade most of my stuff all the way like it didn't?

50
00:02:55,545 --> 00:02:58,821
Scott: I think I got the ancient armor But I got to do a lot of upgrading it by getting Lionel part.

51
00:02:59,123 --> 00:03:00,610
Rym: I decided that wasn't worth it.

52
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:03,050
Rym: I pretty much only ever wore the Zora like the full Zora.

53
00:03:03,472 --> 00:03:11,221
Scott: I think the thing is I just really want to be able to walk up to ancients get and have them shoot lasers and like Nothing even happens like oh you hit me with laser big whoop.

54
00:03:11,362 --> 00:03:12,104
Scott: Wha you're dead.

55
00:03:12,566 --> 00:03:13,670
Scott: That's what I really I just want to do.

56
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:14,382
Scott: That's so bad.

57
00:03:14,585 --> 00:03:23,734
Rym: Yep so, uh, yeah, if you didn't notice it's kind of actually important news because it is it is the most chill packs and it is Real packs.

58
00:03:24,055 --> 00:03:24,738
Rym: but PAX South.

59
00:03:24,798 --> 00:03:30,462
Rym: in San Antonio is January 12th through 14th, which Unfortunately is one week after mag fest.

60
00:03:30,482 --> 00:03:30,945
Scott: So you go to.

61
00:03:31,025 --> 00:03:32,177
Scott: you go to New Year's party Yeah.

62
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:39,544
Scott: And then the next weekend you go to mag fest and the next weekend you go to PAX South and you pay someone to do Your laundry in between because you know that time for that.

63
00:03:39,564 --> 00:03:45,105
Scott: Yeah I'm gonna be gone for a while in January between all the weekend before.

64
00:03:45,145 --> 00:03:46,810
Scott: that is is xmas, right?

65
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:53,694
Scott: so it's like you have four consecutive weekends from the end of December to the middle of January of Boom-boom-boom-boom.

66
00:03:53,955 --> 00:03:55,481
Scott: And if you don't do that, you ain't living.

67
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:55,983
Scott: Yep.

68
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:57,910
Rym: So PAX South remember it.

69
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,090
Scott: Why be a nerd alive on this world?

70
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,414
Scott: If that is not what you do

71
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:13,488
Rym: if PAX Prime is too hard to get into and too far away and too expensive and PAX East there's no hotels because the so hotels are probably sold out for the next 20 years already And you can't just fly to Sydney every year like I do.

72
00:04:14,252 --> 00:04:21,096
Rym: PAX South is like super great and I know we say this a lot but a lot of you don't seem to really understand How great it is.

73
00:04:21,116 --> 00:04:34,370
Scott: it is cheaper to go to PAX South in San Antonio Even if you live if you have to drive and use a hotel at PAX East Because you're just like you're within driving distance of it, but you have to pay for parking in hotel.

74
00:04:34,793 --> 00:04:41,548
Scott: It would be cheaper to fly to San Antonio because the hotel there is so cheap and the packs ticket is so much cheaper.

75
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:41,849
Scott: and

76
00:04:42,211 --> 00:04:46,526
Rym: packs badges went on sale because my alert went off because I forgot to turn it off after when

77
00:04:46,606 --> 00:04:51,217
Scott: I didn't get the alert because I turned it off and also In the bathroom when I had

78
00:04:51,237 --> 00:04:54,470
Rym: and my blood got up because you know my brain still says oh shit packs.

79
00:04:54,732 --> 00:04:56,969
Rym: So I went straight for the hotel and I got the good hotel.

80
00:04:57,271 --> 00:05:01,069
Rym: I won't say the name of the good hotel because I don't want it to ever become the hotel that sells out.

81
00:05:01,633 --> 00:05:02,762
Scott: It's not the cheapest hotel.

82
00:05:02,782 --> 00:05:03,669
Scott: So don't it won't sell true?

83
00:05:04,472 --> 00:05:05,455
Rym: Uh, yeah, none of that.

84
00:05:05,575 --> 00:05:08,504
Rym: I think the con hotel like the closest one is sold out.

85
00:05:08,524 --> 00:05:12,898
Rym: Mm-hmm, but nothing else is no and Three day badges are still available.

86
00:05:12,998 --> 00:05:14,403
Scott: Yep, three day.

87
00:05:14,684 --> 00:05:19,006
Rym: You can buy a single badge That covers three days at PAX South.

88
00:05:19,147 --> 00:05:27,628
Rym: Mm-hmm That might seem crazy if you've been to other paxes But that is how it is and it is a full pax and it focuses heavily tabletop and even the people.

89
00:05:27,648 --> 00:05:27,708
Scott: who?

90
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,683
Scott: Go to PAX for your swag and your industry.

91
00:05:30,724 --> 00:05:31,227
Scott: shit, right?

92
00:05:31,267 --> 00:05:37,308
Scott: It's like yeah It's not nearly as big as East or West not even close in that regard if that's what you're going to PAX for.

93
00:05:37,388 --> 00:05:48,000
Scott: however At the last PAX South that was the first place that they had like Nintendo Switches and all those and it's like it's still There and it's crowded.

94
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,252
Scott: not like they have none of it They don't.

95
00:05:50,372 --> 00:05:59,579
Scott: it's just not crazy like just walk up to one of these booths wait like five minutes and see what's going on And even the eSports like it packs out last time.

96
00:05:59,599 --> 00:06:01,425
Scott: There was a hearthstone tournament right there.

97
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,132
Scott: So I'm like, oh, I'm not doing anything Right now.

98
00:06:03,152 --> 00:06:11,650
Scott: I walk over and sit down and like every single famous hearthstone person Which is there and I'm sure the same was true over in the games for the eSports of other.

99
00:06:11,851 --> 00:06:14,660
Scott: You know things like even though it's PAX out.

100
00:06:14,821 --> 00:06:15,945
Scott: It's it's still a pax.

101
00:06:16,005 --> 00:06:17,450
Scott: It still brings out big guns.

102
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:20,430
Scott: It's just not a big hoo-ha because it's in San Antonio.

103
00:06:20,512 --> 00:06:25,467
Rym: yep, and Most paxes other than West are mostly locals who attend.

104
00:06:25,748 --> 00:06:26,250
Rym: so PAX out.

105
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:29,970
Rym: There's mostly people who live literally like within driving distance in Texas.

106
00:06:30,171 --> 00:06:34,170
Scott: Yeah, that most of the people there are from Texas, Oklahoma and nearby places.

107
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:38,527
Scott: There were not as many people from far away, but look it's cheap if it's from far away.

108
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:41,096
Scott: You can go Low prices.

109
00:06:41,116 --> 00:06:42,809
Scott: so we will find inventions.

110
00:06:42,849 --> 00:06:42,970
Scott: go.

111
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:46,483
Scott: I mean if you can't afford PAX out, you can't afford a convention.

112
00:06:46,523 --> 00:06:47,246
Scott: That's you can't.

113
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:48,210
Scott: that's outside your town.

114
00:06:48,336 --> 00:06:51,843
Rym: Yeah But at that point you gotta look for those local cons like the Zenkaik on the Connecticut.

115
00:06:51,883 --> 00:06:58,710
Scott: the one that makes you are the one That you can like drive to and from with your car to back to your house every day and pay for no hotel.

116
00:06:58,852 --> 00:06:59,849
Scott: That is the cheapest car.

117
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:02,479
Rym: Actually, I think that's part of why the hotels don't sell out.

118
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:06,344
Rym: at PAX out is a lot of people just come for the day Sure?

119
00:07:06,609 --> 00:07:10,890
Rym: or They drive in because they live near San Antonio and they just drive in every day.

120
00:07:11,158 --> 00:07:19,010
Rym: Sure Cuz I notice a lot of people drive out like the hotels are pretty dead at night FX out the parking lot has activity and is full.

121
00:07:19,612 --> 00:07:22,602
Rym: So there's another packs that finally we can announce about.

122
00:07:22,622 --> 00:07:25,230
Rym: at least we're doing at least one panel at PAX West.

123
00:07:25,592 --> 00:07:28,610
Rym: I believe it is our 42nd pax panel.

124
00:07:29,957 --> 00:07:38,810
Rym: That really but I think at this point pax is eclipse Literally every other con we've ever performed at even Otakon where we used to do like five plus a year.

125
00:07:39,131 --> 00:07:42,563
Scott: So unlike pax out, which doesn't sell out pax west.

126
00:07:42,884 --> 00:07:43,768
Scott: I think it's sold out.

127
00:07:43,988 --> 00:07:46,518
Rym: Yeah I don't think so.

128
00:07:46,739 --> 00:07:48,145
Rym: Anyway, I'll check.

129
00:07:48,305 --> 00:07:54,587
Scott: you might be able to buy a Monday But the point is I I've been going to soon be in possession once they mail it.

130
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,236
Rym: Oh Monday is low.

131
00:07:56,256 --> 00:07:56,699
Rym: Okay.

132
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,350
Rym: There are a few Monday badges.

133
00:07:58,571 --> 00:08:06,988
Scott: I have four full sets, but Emily's buying one set Yeah, and some internet person is probably buying another full set, but I still now that our panel is confirmed.

134
00:08:07,249 --> 00:08:08,493
Scott: Yes I have.

135
00:08:08,693 --> 00:08:13,526
Scott: I do not need these two other full sets of pax west badges.

136
00:08:13,847 --> 00:08:15,471
Scott: Friday, Saturday, Sunday Monday.

137
00:08:15,552 --> 00:08:30,655
Scott: if you want to go to pax west and the only thing keeping you from going is that you could not get badges in The crazy run up to buying them You can buy them from me for face value because I don't need them and I do need my money back that I only spent as insurance.

138
00:08:30,897 --> 00:08:39,621
Rym: we buy badges as Insurance because if our panel is rejected we need to go to pax or you will die If I couldn't get one then.

139
00:08:39,642 --> 00:08:41,030
Rym: well, so there's another secret I don't.

140
00:08:41,071 --> 00:08:55,367
Rym: we bring this up occasionally if you care a lot about game design or in the game industry or especially if you're a student at a University if you buy a badge to pax dev which is expensive But there's a huge discount if you're a current college student.

141
00:08:55,548 --> 00:08:57,394
Scott: Mm-hmm You have to be studying.

142
00:08:57,414 --> 00:08:58,861
Scott: games are gonna be studying like medicine.

143
00:08:58,881 --> 00:09:00,126
Rym: You can be studying studying.

144
00:09:00,146 --> 00:09:01,110
Scott: Can you be studying medicine?

145
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:06,784
Rym: I think they check you out like they might email you and be like, hey But I'm pretty sure if you're just going to university they'll let you in.

146
00:09:06,804 --> 00:09:21,661
Rym: All right, but You have the right even though pax west is sold out to just buy one set of full badges for pax to go with your pax dev to go with your pax dev because no one flies to Seattle just for pax.

147
00:09:21,722 --> 00:09:29,287
Scott: that's not cheap though because if you don't live nearby You're also gonna have to pay for extra hotel nights to use your pax dev bed and such and such.

148
00:09:29,307 --> 00:09:35,450
Scott: so that's not a cheap Option, but it is a way that you can spend money to avoid hassle and pegs.

149
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:39,646
Rym: Yeah, wealthy is real good and it's been getting better year by year.

150
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:43,130
Scott: I really enjoy it But I would if I had a ton more vacation days.

151
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:49,310
Rym: I don't go and the only caveat is Do not go if you expect to play games because it is a serious convention.

152
00:09:49,451 --> 00:09:53,810
Rym: We're literally like it's all workshops and like serious panels and business stuff.

153
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:57,124
Scott: It's if I actually can finish making a game and published a game.

154
00:09:57,184 --> 00:09:58,450
Scott: then I would go to pax dev.

155
00:09:58,651 --> 00:10:06,606
Rym: yep, I go partly because I've actually learned if I was really close to doing so and Actually, I've learned a lot too about things we need to do for the convention.

156
00:10:06,626 --> 00:10:12,316
Rym: We're starting that Pre-shit talks and I can talk about it a lot yet, but stay tuned.

157
00:10:12,357 --> 00:10:13,759
Rym: The GeekNights convention is coming.

158
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:22,196
Rym: Mm-hmm It's basically first come first serve.

159
00:10:22,557 --> 00:10:23,339
Rym: event by friend.

160
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:27,490
Rym: if you hear our voices saying this right now, that's good enough.

161
00:10:27,713 --> 00:10:28,509
Scott: That's pretty close.

162
00:10:29,953 --> 00:10:39,415
Rym: Not that many people listen to GeekNights now But we will be at pax west doing a panel on Sunday at 6 30 p.m And keep in mind It's not the last day.

163
00:10:39,516 --> 00:10:40,361
Scott: Monday's the last day.

164
00:10:40,401 --> 00:10:50,713
Rym: Yeah in a theater We've never performed in before the hippogriff theater Hi in the Hyatt because it begins with an H. I think it's the one we saw the Tetris guy in that one year or the One next to it.

165
00:10:50,894 --> 00:10:51,115
Rym: Yep.

166
00:10:51,135 --> 00:10:52,361
Rym: Those are both pretty big too.

167
00:10:52,562 --> 00:10:54,030
Scott: Yeah, they're hard the horizontal kind.

168
00:10:54,171 --> 00:10:56,947
Rym: So the panel is called the rage of the quitter.

169
00:10:57,007 --> 00:10:59,770
Scott: now you might say It's a redo of the quitting panel.

170
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:08,298
Rym: we did before you might say that but actually kind of rewriting that panel because we ran that panel a bunch of times and We both figured out a lot of stuff.

171
00:11:08,518 --> 00:11:10,967
Rym: and I actually I think we have a very different panel to give.

172
00:11:10,987 --> 00:11:17,330
Rym: and well We're still gonna talk about 10-cent beer night because that is one of the most wonderful things that's ever happened in baseball.

173
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:21,929
Rym: But this panel is gonna happen and we're gonna be a fax is gonna be awesome.

174
00:11:22,654 --> 00:11:23,259
Rym: see my scene.

175
00:11:23,501 --> 00:11:26,716
Rym: we talked about tumble seed and The game is hard.

176
00:11:26,736 --> 00:11:29,690
Scott: We did a whole episode in tumble seed games real hard.

177
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:30,193
Scott: Well, it's not.

178
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:31,399
Scott: see the thing is tumble seed.

179
00:11:31,459 --> 00:11:33,470
Scott: I think actually has the right level of difficult.

180
00:11:33,531 --> 00:11:39,470
Scott: I've said this before but I say it again It has the right level of difficulty for a roguelike type game.

181
00:11:39,551 --> 00:11:46,823
Scott: the problem of tumble seed is that The difficulty curve is too steep right away.

182
00:11:46,883 --> 00:11:50,918
Scott: The beginning of level one is there's holes There's monsters that chase you.

183
00:11:51,259 --> 00:11:54,210
Scott: it's like there's holes and bad guys right a fucking way.

184
00:11:54,292 --> 00:11:54,928
Scott: It's like no no, no.

185
00:11:55,311 --> 00:11:56,314
Scott: You can bring that on.

186
00:11:56,355 --> 00:11:56,595
Scott: you can.

187
00:11:56,656 --> 00:11:56,816
Scott: even.

188
00:11:57,358 --> 00:12:00,770
Scott: the game could actually probably get to a difficulty level towards the end.

189
00:12:01,071 --> 00:12:04,350
Scott: That is harder than its current difficulty level towards the end and it would be fine.

190
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:07,139
Scott: You have to start even in the easy mode.

191
00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:10,550
Scott: now the game starts and the board looks like Swiss cheese.

192
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:22,070
Scott: It's like you should start with one hole then one bad guy then maybe two holes, right Mario Mario starts with a flat splays no holes to fall in and one fucking goomba.

193
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:22,223
Scott: right.

194
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:35,090
Scott: you start at the absolute rock bottom where a baby would have to be the only one who could mess this up and Then you curve up nicely and then if you curve nicely you can get to the fucking Mount Everest Heights.

195
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:38,193
Scott: Right as long as your curve is nice You know you could.

196
00:12:38,274 --> 00:12:47,730
Scott: actually you could have a game that curves up nicely and because goes into fucking outer space or the difficulty Is ludicrous like doom nightmare mode difficulty right and that would be fine.

197
00:12:47,991 --> 00:12:54,500
Scott: You cannot have a game that starts at like hurt me plenty Even if it only goes up to ultra violence.

198
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,885
Scott: you started to hurt me plenty.

199
00:12:56,146 --> 00:12:59,899
Scott: people are gonna be like oh Cuz they didn't build the skills to deal with.

200
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,686
Scott: even that medium hurt me plenty level.

201
00:13:01,846 --> 00:13:03,637
Rym: having played it a bunch of Morrison We did that show.

202
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:14,216
Rym: I almost think too that really Even if it started with the Swiss cheese if there weren't enemies for like 10 minutes 10 minutes is too long I mean like just like a screen or two.

203
00:13:14,518 --> 00:13:18,859
Rym: even even 10 minutes like the Swiss cheese alone gives me trouble I but I really okay.

204
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:20,170
Scott: You just really you just really suck.

205
00:13:20,893 --> 00:13:23,725
Rym: I am actually like we're like ice.

206
00:13:23,745 --> 00:13:27,943
Rym: cold beer is a real hard game But I am way worse at it than you might expect.

207
00:13:28,003 --> 00:13:29,409
Scott: okay, you must be really bad cuz.

208
00:13:29,429 --> 00:13:33,763
Scott: I got Anyway, the new my friend Chris was way the netrunner Chris.

209
00:13:33,783 --> 00:13:34,687
Scott: He's way in a tumble seat.

210
00:13:34,727 --> 00:13:38,401
Scott: He was streaming it Whoa, he went away and came back and now it's been updated.

211
00:13:38,461 --> 00:13:39,285
Scott: So he streamed again.

212
00:13:39,305 --> 00:13:55,737
Scott: So what they done is Instead of just the adventure mode, which is still there There's now four other mountains one for each of the four parts of the big mountain So you can just play forest and then you can play jungle and then you can play Right and you can sort of.

213
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:59,893
Scott: it gives you this opportunity to build up your skills and do these little quest You know what.

214
00:14:00,033 --> 00:14:02,024
Scott: and it also gives you these auras.

215
00:14:02,044 --> 00:14:05,449
Scott: remember in the old one The auras are just like partially hurting you.

216
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:13,038
Scott: Yeah Now you can choose when you basically by playing the small mountains you unlock these auras So you can start with one of these auras.

217
00:14:13,058 --> 00:14:22,490
Scott: that's positive only and something like the first aura is like oh You know don't lose your spikes when you fall and or we don't lose your spikes and you get hit or don't lose hearts.

218
00:14:22,631 --> 00:14:23,917
Rym: You know what.

219
00:14:23,937 --> 00:14:26,490
Rym: all that is because I was thinking about the game as I played it more.

220
00:14:27,253 --> 00:14:32,070
Rym: The model for how to map the difficulty of a game like this is actually Crypt of the NecroDancer.

221
00:14:32,633 --> 00:14:43,898
Rym: Crypt of the NecroDancer is like a case study in Introducing increasingly difficult and complex things in a way that will give the character the person playing all the tools They need to get better.

222
00:14:44,201 --> 00:14:52,949
Scott: I'm pretty sure the games that equal that are Mario Super Metroid and I think Mega Man.

223
00:14:53,452 --> 00:14:56,402
Rym: I'd say though because of the way this game works at the stages and the levels.

224
00:14:56,422 --> 00:15:04,690
Rym: in the roguelike aspect NecroDancer is a closer fit Because Mega Man and Mario and all those games have one thing that's very different you the games are not random.

225
00:15:05,031 --> 00:15:10,450
Scott: Yeah, even net hack did a better job at curving up than the first tumble seed.

226
00:15:10,792 --> 00:15:16,156
Rym: Yeah, you can get through like one or two rooms As we said in the review.

227
00:15:16,237 --> 00:15:19,330
Rym: I appreciate the fact that the game is just fuck you in your face.

228
00:15:19,892 --> 00:15:24,610
Rym: That's kind of what ice-cold beer is and this was made by people who were ridiculous fans of that game.

229
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:32,284
Scott: Yes, but if I spend that money to buy this game and I can only play it for a minute before I want to return it That's a problem not for me.

230
00:15:32,304 --> 00:15:32,989
Rym: You sure.

231
00:15:33,712 --> 00:15:39,770
Rym: But yeah, this article talks about how the game will likely never recruit its costs and they talk it's sort of post-mortem.

232
00:15:40,192 --> 00:15:41,037
Rym: It's a fascinating read it.

233
00:15:41,057 --> 00:15:41,982
Rym: I'm not gonna paraphrase the whole thing.

234
00:15:42,003 --> 00:15:50,950
Rym: You just read it, but a sort of tangential point that I think you should bear in mind is that Most games do not recoup their costs.

235
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:55,050
Rym: No Don't think that the fact that this game is hard is the only reason it did.

236
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:55,512
Scott: Well, I think.

237
00:15:55,532 --> 00:16:02,115
Scott: I think also the costs of making tumble seed were higher than you would think because a they put in a lot Of platforms even the switch.

238
00:16:02,275 --> 00:16:02,496
Scott: Yep.

239
00:16:02,797 --> 00:16:06,210
Scott: Also look how fucking polished it is as a piece of software, right?

240
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:11,490
Scott: Even though according to the visuals the sound the they can even get the rumble, right?

241
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:21,125
Scott: It's like they polished the fuck out of this game and that cost them like months and months of development time Of course, which is why it's so great based on specific it.

242
00:16:21,165 --> 00:16:33,850
Rym: like Interactions I've had in the industry about games have succeeded or failed where I learn things about like the actual back-end process The games that tend to make the most money are the ones that spent way more time and money on the polishing aspects.

243
00:16:34,051 --> 00:16:36,483
Scott: Like there's nothing unpolished about tumble seed.

244
00:16:36,523 --> 00:16:37,810
Scott: It just has a difficulty curve.

245
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:41,030
Rym: They polished a knife and then they pushed it into my abdomen.

246
00:16:41,911 --> 00:16:42,453
Scott: That's right.

247
00:16:42,513 --> 00:16:50,469
Scott: It's We're announced as someone gonna yell at us from is pronouncing it again these.

248
00:16:52,051 --> 00:16:53,398
Rym: I'm so bad at German pronunciation.

249
00:16:53,478 --> 00:16:55,810
Scott: I cannot pronounce it, but it's why it's the game of the year.

250
00:16:56,152 --> 00:16:58,710
Scott: You've probably seen his logo on various board game boxes.

251
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:01,440
Scott: It's a red pawn with a little yellow flag sword fighting.

252
00:17:01,481 --> 00:17:03,890
Scott: very good and they yeah, they award this award.

253
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:09,410
Scott: We said this so many times in the show, but whatever every year they give this award out to the best board game.

254
00:17:09,751 --> 00:17:11,237
Scott: There's one that's the spiel.

255
00:17:11,257 --> 00:17:12,843
Scott: this are the default one.

256
00:17:13,204 --> 00:17:14,589
Scott: This one is the kinner spiel.

257
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:19,670
Scott: That's like the one for the kids game and then there's like a another one for a strategy game, right?

258
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:24,326
Scott: so the regulars feel this are you know, the the sort of criteria for winning?

259
00:17:24,425 --> 00:17:25,530
Scott: it is sort of like.

260
00:17:25,731 --> 00:17:28,532
Scott: You know not what you would expect But it doesn't matter.

261
00:17:28,553 --> 00:17:36,017
Scott: the games that win it are usually terrific and the game that won it this year is king domino Or is it king kingdom?

262
00:17:36,157 --> 00:17:38,243
Scott: I know kingdom, you know, you know what it's.

263
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:39,688
Rym: it's kingdom up.

264
00:17:40,069 --> 00:17:46,670
Scott: Yes It's a game that combines The theme of kingdoms with the play of dominoes.

265
00:17:47,451 --> 00:17:50,915
Scott: King domino king domino Whatever you want to call it.

266
00:17:51,216 --> 00:17:53,001
Rym: It's dominoes and kingdoms.

267
00:17:53,603 --> 00:17:55,007
Scott: Okay, I'd be seeing it.

268
00:17:55,127 --> 00:17:56,090
Scott: I really want to play it.

269
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:58,659
Scott: Yeah, I really don't want to keep it in my house.

270
00:17:58,719 --> 00:18:01,870
Rym: I see spend money on kingdoms dominoes all together.

271
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,737
Scott: I love kingdoms and I like dominoes.

272
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:05,344
Scott: So full also.

273
00:18:05,424 --> 00:18:05,966
Scott: I got green.

274
00:18:05,987 --> 00:18:07,814
Scott: look there's a green piece I played from here.

275
00:18:07,915 --> 00:18:09,481
Rym: I played a lot of dominoes as a kid.

276
00:18:09,501 --> 00:18:11,510
Scott: like straight dominoes itself is not great.

277
00:18:11,631 --> 00:18:18,570
Scott: No, dominoes is not a good game No, but dominoes is a good game to play with some Hispanic guys on a folding table out in Queens.

278
00:18:18,771 --> 00:18:24,230
Rym: But that's a lot like playing backgammon with a bunch of like old Turkish guys in Turkey exactly playing for the game.

279
00:18:24,451 --> 00:18:29,350
Rym: You're playing as an excuse to sit out in the evening under the Sun sipping some tea and bullshitting for four.

280
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,682
Scott: I'm playing as practice for my retirement year.

281
00:18:31,863 --> 00:18:40,928
Scott: Yeah, cuz that's one day I'm gonna be that old guy and some punk kid is gonna want to practice for his retirement And it's gonna come play backgammon and dominoes with me circle of life.

282
00:18:41,048 --> 00:18:41,430
Scott: That's right.

283
00:18:41,973 --> 00:18:43,564
Rym: I have no idea what the mechanics are.

284
00:18:43,584 --> 00:18:51,297
Scott: Yeah I think you play tiles that are domino like a forest test a touch of forest and then you put ponds on them Like I don't know.

285
00:18:51,579 --> 00:18:53,011
Rym: There's definitely some card counting I think.

286
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:57,367
Rym: as it looks I see a a board that tells you how many of each type exists.

287
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:58,350
Scott: I'm sure it's a great game.

288
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:03,782
Rym: We'll play it probably very soon Because I'm actually gonna get rid of a bunch of board games me too.

289
00:19:03,863 --> 00:19:05,550
Scott: if anyone wants a bunch of board games.

290
00:19:05,691 --> 00:19:06,990
Rym: Hey, well keep stay tuned.

291
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:09,750

Rym: if people make a tear and if you're at that tear every month We'll mail you something at least as valuable or nerdy as a board game.

301
00:19:48,178 --> 00:19:49,632
Rym: Until we run out of stuff No We'll get rid of.

Scott: I have volumes of initial D. I've got like 20 plus of them.

306
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:03,930
Scott: What if I said one person find one and one person find that's even funnier and one person find the right way to do it.

307
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,035
Scott: That's the right way to do it.

308
00:20:05,155 --> 00:20:10,200
Scott: I feel like I all got to go to the same phone all of dr Slump, but we want to keep that.

309
00:20:10,401 --> 00:20:11,929
Rym: I just want to read it before I give it away.

310
00:20:12,171 --> 00:20:12,673
Rym: That's exact.

311
00:20:12,694 --> 00:20:13,779
Scott: so I'm doing a full metal alchemist.

312
00:20:13,819 --> 00:20:15,810

314
00:20:17,838 --> 00:20:21,955
Scott: I'm gonna read them all and then sell get rid of them somehow I don't know.

315
00:20:21,975 --> 00:20:23,123
Rym: I feel like my brain does that.

316
00:20:23,445 --> 00:20:27,662
Rym: I lost Interest in full metal alchemists like the part of my brain that was into.

317
00:20:27,722 --> 00:20:29,389
Rym: it just said what was live-action?

318
00:20:29,409 --> 00:20:31,942
Scott: now I don't even it came like it came back the other day.

319
00:20:31,983 --> 00:20:33,370
Scott: I saw tweets about full metal alchemists.

320
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:34,115
Scott: I'm like what the fuck.

321
00:20:34,176 --> 00:20:36,009
Scott: and it's like oh, there's live-action like what the fuck.

322
00:20:37,151 --> 00:20:45,457
Scott: But the manga is different from the the other one, you know, yeah There's two anime and that stupid movie.

323
00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:47,063
Rym: none of them seem to link up.

324
00:20:47,104 --> 00:20:48,870
Rym: they're all just like it's the El Hazzard.

325
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:50,578
Scott: That's why I'm just gonna read the whole manga.

326
00:20:50,618 --> 00:20:53,230
Scott: cuz look that because the thing is the models don't even care.

327
00:20:53,451 --> 00:20:55,259
Scott: The person who made the manga is real good.

328
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:56,425
Scott: They also made silver spoon.

329
00:20:57,168 --> 00:20:58,698
Scott: Oh, yeah Yeah, it's a good the manga.

330
00:20:58,738 --> 00:21:00,208
Scott: I think might be the best version of it.

331
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:03,650
Rym: Yeah, the thing is I just finished eccentric family and yeah also.

332
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:09,439
Scott: Yeah, Oh Chikoku, but there wasn't as much Chikoku as you promised.

333
00:21:09,459 --> 00:21:14,634
Scott: big episode and then there's a callback there is but that you promised more Chikoku than there was.

334
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:18,470
Rym: I guess I guess that I was just so much Chikoku like crammed in also.

335
00:21:19,012 --> 00:21:19,915
Scott: That's my kind of Chikoku.

336
00:21:20,035 --> 00:21:23,105
Scott: Yeah, it is the best cut the industrialization of hell.

337
00:21:23,426 --> 00:21:24,390
Rym: Oh, yeah, that's some good biz.

338
00:21:26,552 --> 00:21:34,530
Rym: So in some other news we talked about this way back that Blizzard Is trying to do for real eSports like teammate like the new.

339
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:38,729
Scott: I wonder if it's because some Blizzard employees sat at a panel where we said that someone should do this.

340
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:39,718
Rym: Yeah, it might have been.

341
00:21:39,738 --> 00:21:40,990
Scott: could we take credit for this?

342
00:21:41,211 --> 00:21:50,230
Scott: I don't know But we did do a panel where we said a lot of these ideas and there were definitely Blizzard People in the audience at this panel and those are people who are smart.

343
00:21:51,551 --> 00:21:56,310
Scott: That's all I can say like how they haven't spoken to me since I actually have no idea.

344
00:21:56,652 --> 00:21:56,773
Scott: It's

345
00:21:56,813 --> 00:22:12,709
Rym: kind of like how back at RIT we all of us made that we had this long-running joke about mosh mosh revolution and then like a few days later Mosh mosh revolution appeared in mega Tokyo and we're pretty sure that Ken Hashimoto the blur

346
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,859
Scott: You mean can quote the blur.

347
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:16,903
Scott: quote Hashimoto?

348
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:18,470
Rym: Yeah, Ken the blur Hashimoto.

349
00:22:18,651 --> 00:22:19,695
Rym: Yes, pretty sure.

350
00:22:19,735 --> 00:22:22,465
Scott: where is and what is Ken the blur Hashimoto doing?

351
00:22:22,906 --> 00:22:24,730
Scott: Oh 2017?

352
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:29,585
Rym: Someone told me recently, but I forgot it all like some stuff happened with him.

353
00:22:29,706 --> 00:22:30,929
Rym: I guess I don't know.

354
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,467
Rym: Maybe for all I know he's listening to this.

355
00:22:33,192 --> 00:22:36,586
Rym: I would be very very sad the blur if you were listening to this.

356
00:22:36,928 --> 00:22:37,390
Rym: email us.

357
00:22:37,651 --> 00:22:38,655
Rym: I want to get you on the show.

358
00:22:38,695 --> 00:22:40,462
Scott: Also, how do you feel about being called the blur?

359
00:22:40,483 --> 00:22:45,416
Rym: I Feel like that was a badge of honor at least at one point I didn't think of as an insult.

360
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:48,570
Rym: that was just a descriptive nickname because he was the blur.

361
00:22:49,554 --> 00:22:59,090
Scott: The thing is as the problem happens a lot is you have a nickname for someone that's not insulting But it's just describing of their personality and and you know personage, right?

362
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,714
Scott: Yeah, but you don't use it.

363
00:23:00,895 --> 00:23:02,942
Scott: You don't call them that to their face.

364
00:23:03,504 --> 00:23:07,737
Scott: So it feels like you shouldn't like Because you haven't done that.

365
00:23:08,078 --> 00:23:09,684
Scott: it feels like you're insulting them.

366
00:23:10,046 --> 00:23:18,417
Scott: plus, you know There are certain kinds of nicknames that are phrased in such a way that you could call someone that like if someone's nickname is stumps You could like yo stumps.

367
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:20,227
Scott: Yeah, but you can't be like yo.

368
00:23:20,307 --> 00:23:22,592
Rym: the blur You know.

369
00:23:22,633 --> 00:23:23,877
Rym: definite articles just don't work.

370
00:23:23,978 --> 00:23:24,841
Scott: Yeah, it doesn't work.

371
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:26,407
Scott: But anyway, I give isn't?

372
00:23:26,427 --> 00:23:27,070
Scott: it was blurry.

373
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,097
Scott: I could be like a blurry.

374
00:23:28,137 --> 00:23:28,620
Scott: what's going on?

375
00:23:28,982 --> 00:23:29,989
Rym: That is not the news.

376
00:23:30,812 --> 00:23:33,361
Rym: the news is that it's really it's.

377
00:23:33,702 --> 00:23:34,184
Rym: it's really.

378
00:23:34,224 --> 00:23:40,330
Rym: take it off for real because The owners of some of the teams are now known right?

379
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:45,090
Scott: So to become an owner you have to buy a team license from Blizzard or whatever for millions of dollars.

380
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:46,557
Scott: Yep, and then you now own a team.

381
00:23:46,577 --> 00:23:47,240
Scott: Congratulations.

382
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:56,530
Rym: Jeff Wilpon who owns the New York Mets Now owns the New York team, which means we will never win anything and we will buy season tickets anyway.

383
00:23:56,771 --> 00:23:57,414
Rym: Well, what'd you say?

384
00:23:57,655 --> 00:23:58,158
Rym: We're gonna be.

385
00:23:58,379 --> 00:24:00,690
Rym: we're gonna those two old dudes like 80 years from now.

386
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:14,987
Scott: Well now think about the Mets exit have only existed since 1962. there are people at least some who have had season tickets to the New York Mets since 1962 and they were probably 30-something years old then and now they're 80 years old.

387
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:20,185
Rym: I mean, I knew some people tangentially as a kid whose family had passed down like Red Wings.

388
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:21,770
Rym: season tickets forever, right?

389
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:23,337
Scott: So now this is art.

390
00:24:23,357 --> 00:24:24,302
Scott: does every you know?

391
00:24:24,382 --> 00:24:25,990
Scott: sports are a thing that you know.

392
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:28,650
Scott: They feel like they're so long like they've always been there.

393
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:29,212
Scott: It's like no.

394
00:24:29,453 --> 00:24:30,859
Scott: the NBA is super new.

395
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,510
Scott: the Super Bowl is about as new as the Mets.

396
00:24:33,991 --> 00:24:35,255
Scott: Right is not.

397
00:24:35,376 --> 00:24:39,790
Scott: it's like MLS is actually a big deal and that's really new right?

398
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:40,796
Rym: Well, I mean look at.

399
00:24:40,837 --> 00:24:41,930
Rym: so I tweeted the other day.

400
00:24:42,051 --> 00:24:53,519
Rym: I was looking at magic and like the tiny percentage of magic I have played compared to all the magic that has happened in the many many many many years since I stopped playing It's like 20 years of magic.

401
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,352
Scott: Yeah, that's in a few sets a year Okay.

402
00:24:56,372 --> 00:25:01,205
Scott: Anyway, but the point is we will buy season tickets to the New York overwatch, whatever they are.

403
00:25:01,446 --> 00:25:02,048
Scott: Well, where they're?

404
00:25:02,068 --> 00:25:02,790
Scott: fucking jerseys?

405
00:25:03,092 --> 00:25:04,622
Rym: Yeah, I'll get a jersey.

406
00:25:04,642 --> 00:25:05,930
Rym: Yeah a hundred percent.

407
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:10,110
Scott: I don't even play the goddamn game and I'm gonna go there and go woo in the Boston team.

408
00:25:10,351 --> 00:25:11,135
Rym: They're the Boston team.

409
00:25:11,215 --> 00:25:14,110
Rym: Robert Kraft who owns the New York New England Patriots bought that team.

410
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:28,103
Scott: Yeah, so 30 years from now our kids look like whoa, we inherited The kids we won't have yeah are gonna inherit tickets to all our friends kids This team with the great legacy the New York, whatever overwatch player.

411
00:25:28,264 --> 00:25:30,190
Scott: They won four Reinhardt cups.

412
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:44,440
Scott: Yeah, the only the only thing is that I don't I really want it to be a thing that lasts a long time But I don't have confidence in any video game even counter-strike lasting as long as a game like baseball or hockey or Right.

413
00:25:44,461 --> 00:25:49,550
Scott: Yeah So we're gonna go see this overwatch team and cheer for them and whatever.

414
00:25:49,931 --> 00:25:52,362
Scott: And but then like 15 years now overwatch will be dead.

415
00:25:52,402 --> 00:25:53,607
Rym: and this is the big debate.

416
00:25:53,647 --> 00:25:54,190
Scott: What's gonna happen?

417
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:54,932
Rym: What will?

418
00:25:55,233 --> 00:25:58,065
Rym: what is going to be the dominant model of eSports in the future?

419
00:25:58,105 --> 00:25:59,390
Rym: Will it be a heterogeneous environment?

420
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:05,050
Rym: Will there be leagues that are multi or teams that are multi sport or that evolve over time?

421
00:26:05,291 --> 00:26:13,354
Rym: Whether be leagues just based on individual games or it'll be leagues based on genres like the fighting game league and they play it like Multiple fighting games.

422
00:26:13,414 --> 00:26:17,488
Scott: I wonder if like for example Street Fighter is already on Street Fighter 5 Evo just happened.

423
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:21,687
Scott: Yeah Someone I didn't want to win one, but that's whatever the.

424
00:26:22,792 --> 00:26:27,350
Scott: Can they keep Street Fighter going forever by making Street Fighter 6 Street Fighter 7 Street Fighter 8?

425
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:31,630
Scott: Can they keep that going for literally eternity or super as long as baseball?

426
00:26:32,552 --> 00:26:35,480
Rym: I mean today is like hockey version 9.

427
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,488
Scott: They've had Street Fighter going since you know, the 80s 90s, right?

428
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:43,490
Scott: So it's already been quite a while, but they got a long way to catch up to baseball levels.

429
00:26:43,771 --> 00:26:45,277
Scott: Can they keep it going?

430
00:26:45,377 --> 00:26:50,739
Scott: and if they can where they just get out like that if they can do it with Street Fighter Which I guess is the one that's furthest along.

431
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,730
Scott: I think it is the furthest along right then That means you can keep it going with counter-strike.

432
00:26:55,811 --> 00:27:04,170
Scott: You can keep it going with League of Legends Going with overwatch by making overwatch 2, overwatch 3, overwatch 4, CS go, CS stop, CS run, CS walk.

433
00:27:04,934 --> 00:27:06,704
Scott: Yeah, whatever you got to make right?

434
00:27:07,066 --> 00:27:07,750
Rym: So this is news.

435
00:27:07,991 --> 00:27:12,564
Rym: The other news I got is that apparently this seems to be like a recent thing.

436
00:27:12,584 --> 00:27:22,370
Rym: It appears that the MLB May be in a trademark dispute with the Overwatch League about how similar their baseball man is to Tracer.

437
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:26,825
Scott: But the NBA Jerry West logo is more similar to the MLB logo.

438
00:27:26,865 --> 00:27:28,310
Scott: It uses the same fucking colors.

439
00:27:28,973 --> 00:27:32,930
Scott: Why would you try they just suing the Overwatch League because it's the same shape?

440
00:27:33,811 --> 00:27:36,550
Rym: I think I am NOT a lawyer.

441
00:27:36,911 --> 00:27:43,750
Rym: This is just my personal opinion that this is a sign that traditional sports are afraid of eSports.

442
00:27:44,654 --> 00:27:47,470
Scott: I think that's just something that eSports people want to tell themselves.

443
00:27:48,114 --> 00:27:55,990
Rym: I feel like if eSports were not on this like Significant money tide that's coming in MLB would have not even looked at this twice.

444
00:27:56,371 --> 00:28:00,243
Scott: Mmm, cuz I like you definitely don't sue anyone who doesn't have any fucking money, right?

445
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:01,246
Scott: And this you're a patent troll.

446
00:28:01,647 --> 00:28:04,815
Scott: Yeah You sue people who have money.

447
00:28:04,976 --> 00:28:07,785
Scott: so that means that overwatch has enough money to be worth suing.

448
00:28:08,327 --> 00:28:11,260
Scott: well Activision Blizzard Yeah, they have enough money to be worth doing.

449
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,506
Rym: I own a bunch of their stock.

450
00:28:12,627 --> 00:28:21,099
Rym: Sure But anyway things of the day.

451
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:23,407
Rym: so we were just talking about the evolution of sports, right?

452
00:28:23,728 --> 00:28:25,601
Rym: This is an article I'm not going to summarize all.

453
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:43,938
Rym: you should read it yourself But it shows a lot of examples and talks in depth about how dramatically Goalkeeping in hockey has changed just in recent years because of a few very specific and seemingly minor changes to the way Goal-tender equipment functions.

454
00:28:43,998 --> 00:28:47,190
Scott: Yeah, people always talk about like I'm a goaltender said these giant pads.

455
00:28:47,271 --> 00:28:48,989
Scott: They keep getting bigger and that was true.

456
00:28:49,432 --> 00:28:53,410
Scott: But there have been recent some rules changes that have been made making them smaller in size, right?

457
00:28:53,750 --> 00:29:02,879
Scott: But so the fact that they rotate around the leg the size matters much less than these other things That lay people do who just seek.

458
00:29:02,899 --> 00:29:08,125
Scott: because a layperson looks at the giant pads looks at the old small pads It's like uh-huh that ruined goal tending.

459
00:29:08,165 --> 00:29:11,790
Scott: That's why But a layperson doesn't see this.

460
00:29:12,071 --> 00:29:16,067
Scott: But if you read this article and watch these videos, then you will see what lay people don't see.

461
00:29:16,127 --> 00:29:26,838
Rym: you layperson you yep, and it's very important because like we said, you know overwatch to overwatch 3 or a street fighter with the with the with the eSports leagues regular sports keep changing the rules.

462
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:34,665
Rym: hockey like so many versions and this version of hockey today is more different than hockey of the old time days.

463
00:29:35,188 --> 00:29:40,565
Rym: then Baseball like like all these sports change faster than video games do.

464
00:29:40,866 --> 00:29:47,088
Rym: if you actually think about it it's just people think of sports as being very continuous and think of the tradition as being very static.

465
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:51,741
Rym: and Unless you're a superfan, you don't notice all these actually really big changes that occur.

466
00:29:51,761 --> 00:29:52,242
Rym: Mm-hmm.

467
00:29:52,844 --> 00:29:53,285
Scott: So we got.

468
00:29:53,786 --> 00:29:56,549
Scott: so everyone knows Bowling is kind of lame.

469
00:29:57,123 --> 00:30:04,134
Rym: Yeah I took a bowling class and I got up to like 170 180 average after 10 weeks and I'm right back down to my 170 80 average.

470
00:30:04,154 --> 00:30:04,255
Rym: Yeah.

471
00:30:04,275 --> 00:30:19,249
Scott: Anyway yeah, the bowling is the thing that people do in small-town America because there's nothing better to do and things you do a birthday parties or work parties because it's generic and Appropriate for all ages and accessible even if you suck at it.

472
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:24,030
Rym: We used to go to the bowling alley right near RIT a couple a couple times because there was a DDR machine there.

473
00:30:24,071 --> 00:30:24,504
Scott: That's right.

474
00:30:24,911 --> 00:30:26,797
Scott: We thought the DDR we didn't play.

475
00:30:26,817 --> 00:30:30,390
Rym: they had like a max one machine there and all the other places had like fifth mix.

476
00:30:30,532 --> 00:30:33,193
Scott: so but anyway It's all.

477
00:30:33,233 --> 00:30:39,861
Scott: if you know anything about bowling you'll know that like they wax the bowling lanes otherwise, the ball wouldn't really roll too well and just some bare wood.

478
00:30:39,881 --> 00:30:40,303
Scott: right.

479
00:30:40,363 --> 00:30:43,922
Scott: it's waxed up and Because it's not just rolling.

480
00:30:43,982 --> 00:30:45,488
Rym: It's also sliding Yep.

481
00:30:45,731 --> 00:30:54,058
Scott: So the thing is bowling lanes based on the machine that waxes them or if they're waxed by hand, which I don't think anyone does They have a different pattern of wax.

482
00:30:54,118 --> 00:31:02,410
Scott: and that pattern of wax that is on the bowling alley Significantly influences the ball movement which to a normal person doesn't matter.

483
00:31:02,571 --> 00:31:14,810
Scott: But if you're a pro who's got a bowl of strike almost every time or at least a spare that small You know way in which the wax moves the ball around is the difference between a spare and a nine and that's enormous.

484
00:31:15,212 --> 00:31:20,777
Scott: You know, it's there's doing a strike and a nine right because the ball is just an inch to the right or an inch to The left because that wax.

485
00:31:20,958 --> 00:31:21,400
Rym: well think of it.

486
00:31:21,441 --> 00:31:33,070
Scott: if the wax were perfectly uniform Pretty much any confident bowler could do a 300 If the wax was a hundred percent the same on every bowling alley ever and it was always perfect every time.

487
00:31:33,511 --> 00:31:45,335
Scott: all you had to do is practice this thing and practice it so much that you could Perfectly repeat it every single time like line your foot up with the markers stand at the exact same distance Do the exact same moves

488
00:31:45,355 --> 00:31:47,682
Rym: like the bowling in Breath of the Wild with the

489
00:31:47,722 --> 00:31:50,190
Scott: snow and it's like a human can achieve that if they?

490
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:51,479
Scott: Put enough effort into it.

491
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,890
Scott: It's called pitching in baseball, right?

492
00:31:53,070 --> 00:32:00,190
Scott: They throw the ball in almost the exact same spot at a ludicrous speed by and they get there and they do it by Practicing and doing it over and over again, right?

493
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:10,265
Scott: So the fact that wax is different is what makes bowling at all challenging Which is actually kind of interesting because what sports do we have where the in?

494
00:32:10,485 --> 00:32:13,533
Scott: not your equipment not yourself But the environment.

495
00:32:13,553 --> 00:32:16,662
Scott: hockey the ice the ice and hockey makes a difference.

496
00:32:17,023 --> 00:32:19,810
Scott: the field and baseball actually makes a significant difference.

497
00:32:20,573 --> 00:32:24,290
Rym: The fields are different to like in different places like they're shaped differently in different football.

498
00:32:24,491 --> 00:32:28,963
Scott: You have grass and turf and the crowd influences a little and every any spectator.

499
00:32:28,984 --> 00:32:34,258
Scott: sport the crowd influences except for the annoying country Club ones like bowling golf tennis where you're supposed to be quiet.

500
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:35,341
Scott: right tennis.

501
00:32:35,361 --> 00:32:38,168
Scott: You got the clay composite grass situation, right?

502
00:32:38,509 --> 00:32:45,312
Scott: But In bowling, I think it might be matter like the most directly and obviously Partly cuz.

503
00:32:45,332 --> 00:32:47,641
Rym: there's not much else that could matter right?

504
00:32:47,681 --> 00:32:54,700
Rym: There's not that much like I'm not saying the I 70 or 80 like I'm not a good bowler.

505
00:32:54,841 --> 00:33:01,907
Scott: the pins do not matter in bowling is yeah There's only so many factors that matter you the ball in the lane and the wax in the lane and that's it.

506
00:33:02,108 --> 00:33:09,890
Scott: So If you we always knew that this is a thing the wax but I didn't actually know the details of the wax.

507
00:33:10,392 --> 00:33:11,116
Scott: How does it matter?

508
00:33:11,398 --> 00:33:12,665
Scott: How is it apply all this stuff?

509
00:33:12,725 --> 00:33:18,450
Scott: So Here's a great video explaining everything that a normal non bowling person needs to know about bowling wax.

510
00:33:19,053 --> 00:33:19,858
Scott: It's really interesting.

511
00:33:19,898 --> 00:33:25,602
Scott: if you care about even if you just care about games And sports even if you don't care about bowling itself, it's still interesting.

512
00:33:25,622 --> 00:33:27,349
Scott: Yeah, it's worth your time to watch this.

513
00:33:27,851 --> 00:33:28,713
Rym: It's in the in the moment.

514
00:33:28,733 --> 00:33:30,319
Rym: The book club book is Frank Herbert's doing.

515
00:33:30,499 --> 00:33:35,593
Scott: I have finished reading this book as have I so Tomorrow we're gonna work.

516
00:33:35,934 --> 00:33:38,843
Scott: Well tomorrow you're listening to this probably on Wednesday.

517
00:33:38,943 --> 00:33:39,504
Scott: Probably.

518
00:33:39,565 --> 00:33:41,390
Scott: Yeah, it's we're releasing this Tuesday night.

519
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:56,141
Scott: There's nine people listening to it right now, I guess most people will listen to this Wednesday, which means that Thursday we're gonna record an episode about dune and announce the next book club and Probably listen to that on Friday because it's a book club episode.

520
00:33:56,161 --> 00:33:58,670
Rym: We're gonna assume anyone who listens to it read the book.

521
00:33:58,951 --> 00:33:59,839
Scott: Yep, that's how we're

522
00:34:00,122 --> 00:34:00,908
Rym: gonna talk about it

523
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:04,523
Scott: And I'm sure since this is one of the most famous nerd books of

524
00:34:04,684 --> 00:34:06,290
Rym: are gonna be real mad about our opinion

525
00:34:06,591 --> 00:34:13,536
Scott: Because we also have a board game that is related to this and I haven't played the RTS So I can't really say anything about that.

526
00:34:13,717 --> 00:34:18,784
Scott: Yeah, even though that was one of the first real RTS games ever We're gonna have a lot to say about this.

527
00:34:18,804 --> 00:34:19,268
Scott: So you should listen.

528
00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:22,762
Rym: I think it tells the exact same story as Hyperion but much more simply.

529
00:34:22,782 --> 00:34:24,850
Scott: Oh, it's similar to Hyperion.

530
00:34:24,955 --> 00:34:29,402
Rym: Yeah Well very specific things are similar and what how much?

531
00:34:29,503 --> 00:34:31,690
Scott: well how much of Hyperion was inspired from dude?

532
00:34:32,071 --> 00:34:33,036
Rym: I think I'll significant.

533
00:34:33,056 --> 00:34:41,145
Rym: I think the core premise was inspired maybe of Humanities path and evolution and also that shut thou shall not disfigure the soul.

534
00:34:41,165 --> 00:34:41,786
Rym: Mm-hmm.

535
00:34:41,987 --> 00:34:44,998
Rym: That is stuff That's heavily cribbed in Prince of Nothing.

536
00:34:45,661 --> 00:34:46,101
Scott: Oh, yeah.

537
00:34:46,283 --> 00:34:46,563
Scott: Yes.

538
00:34:46,643 --> 00:34:46,844
Scott: Yeah.

539
00:34:47,005 --> 00:34:47,246
Scott: Yeah.

540
00:34:47,286 --> 00:34:58,829
Rym: Yeah, but All I want to say is that a lot of you over the years who have given me flag for not having really read dune Have implied that this book is way more complex than it was.

541
00:34:59,171 --> 00:35:11,227
Scott: Well, I think also just because something is some epic ultra-famous nerd book it gets like this huge Reputation that it has to like uphold right and the reputation comes after you write it not before.

542
00:35:11,307 --> 00:35:12,410
Scott: so it's like who can you blame?

543
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:13,249
Scott: On this right?

544
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:14,906
Scott: It's just like you know.

545
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:19,326
Scott: When so many nerds prop something up you start to look at the nerds and not at the thing.

546
00:35:19,587 --> 00:35:24,085
Rym: true true But just the characters were the opposite of inscrutable.

547
00:35:24,105 --> 00:35:27,234
Rym: Oh What's the Baron?

548
00:35:27,294 --> 00:35:28,117
Rym: our Conan won?

549
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:32,650
Rym: he wants little boys to rape and he's a bad guy.

550
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:35,419
Scott: He wants Monet and power.

551
00:35:35,479 --> 00:35:38,690
Rym: He wants to keep his line going because of his own stupid reasons.

552
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:43,964
Scott: He's also not actually that smart and he's won spies cuz everyone wants fun.

553
00:35:44,004 --> 00:35:46,249
Scott: Yeah, he's hoarding it and he's bad.

554
00:35:48,512 --> 00:35:51,024
Rym: That's that's the extent of the complexity of that character.

555
00:35:51,084 --> 00:35:57,716
Rym: and the bad guy Favorite my favorite.

556
00:35:57,937 --> 00:35:59,062
Rym: He's my favorite in the game.

557
00:35:59,162 --> 00:36:00,930
Rym: I think I want to always play the Harkonnen in the game.

558
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:03,390
Rym: My favorite character is actually Kynes Keens.

559
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:06,298
Rym: Well, yeah, Leah Keens the ecologist.

560
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:06,900
Scott: Mm-hmm.

561
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:11,132
Rym: I think he's my favorite character other than maybe Stilgar Still guys.

562
00:36:11,172 --> 00:36:12,096
Scott: All right, my favorite guys.

563
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:13,099
Rym: really Jessica a lot.

564
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,427
Scott: I thought your favorite guy would be Bard guy.

565
00:36:15,447 --> 00:36:17,851
Scott: Oh, yeah Gurney.

566
00:36:17,971 --> 00:36:19,857
Rym: Yeah, Gurney's a super great dude.

567
00:36:19,997 --> 00:36:26,388
Rym: Yeah, Gurney is like he's a multi-class fighter Bard And he's pretty high level too.

568
00:36:27,192 --> 00:36:29,903
Rym: Anyway, we will talk about dune in depth on the next show.

569
00:36:29,923 --> 00:36:37,153
Rym: and the other important meta thing other than things We've already talked about is that a big part of why I had the idea to do the show we're about to do.

570
00:36:37,173 --> 00:37:01,190
Rym: the topic is that I have listened to a Lot of the board game reviews that GeekNights has done over the years some of them from as far back as 2006 2007 well And some of them more recently and I noticed a lot about the way we review board games And we've gone through like Almost five sort of distinct eras of what we focus on and how we review the game.

571
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:07,188
Scott: Well, unlike some, you know journalistic outlets that actually care about reviewing with some sort of integrity or whatever.

572
00:37:07,268 --> 00:37:11,545
Scott: Well, they Yeah, they Pretending to have object.

573
00:37:11,565 --> 00:37:21,370
Scott: Yeah They tend to have a format or a process for reviewing like a checklist of things your review has to do Right and some of them even have scores and categories and shit and we don't do anything.

574
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:22,881
Scott: We just talk about something for 20 to 30 minutes.

575
00:37:22,901 --> 00:37:30,370
Scott: Yep, and So our formats have you know, like, you know, we might not forget to talk about an aspect of something or whatever.

576
00:37:30,555 --> 00:37:31,773
Scott: You know It just happens.

577
00:37:32,014 --> 00:37:33,198
Rym: but the thing was interesting.

578
00:37:33,258 --> 00:37:38,275
Rym: is that much like with anime and everything else when we started GeekNights We were fresh out of university.

579
00:37:38,295 --> 00:37:45,969
Rym: Mm-hmm, and we had consumed a lot of media a lot of games A lot of stuff in our entire lives up to that point.

580
00:37:46,532 --> 00:37:51,330
Rym: So we had a backlog of things we could review that we had immense experience with.

581
00:37:52,053 --> 00:37:58,849
Rym: So like when we started reviewing board games like we reviewed Puerto Rico on GeekNights We had already played it more than a hundred times.

582
00:37:59,391 --> 00:38:04,650
Rym: Mm-hmm when we reviewed Carcassonne or settlers we had played them to the point that we had solved them.

583
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:09,002
Scott: So all those early that's true is that we were reviewing.

584
00:38:09,022 --> 00:38:10,388
Scott: we were reviewing a game, right?

585
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:11,814
Scott: We were basically.

586
00:38:11,854 --> 00:38:14,810
Scott: the first episode of GeekNights was in 2005.

587
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:19,121
Scott: It had at least five years of material to work with.

588
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:25,985
Scott: now, even if we take a break for a vacation, it's like, okay great We've got an extra two weeks of material to work of things.

589
00:38:26,005 --> 00:38:27,110
Scott: We haven't talked about yet.

590
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:31,285
Scott: Once we drained that five-year pool of material, right?

591
00:38:31,386 --> 00:38:32,530
Scott: It's like now it's just a trickle.

592
00:38:32,892 --> 00:38:35,228
Rym: but the trouble was that are the.

593
00:38:35,671 --> 00:38:40,990
Rym: When we gave reviews that were good like in my opinion having listen to a bunch of them done some pretty mediocre reviews occasionally.

594
00:38:41,332 --> 00:38:45,029
Scott: Yeah in a thousand something episodes most of them are crap in fact by all of them.

595
00:38:45,916 --> 00:38:47,630
Scott: Some are slightly less crap, but they all crap.

596
00:38:47,971 --> 00:38:57,168
Rym: But our best reviews were when we'd played a game so much that we had a deep Intuitive understanding of all the mechanics of the game.

597
00:38:57,188 --> 00:39:00,790
Rym: Yep So I noticed that our reviews did follow a pretty specific format.

598
00:39:01,151 --> 00:39:10,082
Rym: We talked about the premise then we talked about the rules themselves and whether or not they were well written or consistent The learning experience the initial play experience.

599
00:39:10,383 --> 00:39:12,330
Rym: and then we talked about the end game.

600
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:14,039
Rym: Like how long will it take to get to the end game?

601
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,005
Rym: What is the end game?

602
00:39:15,105 --> 00:39:15,970
Rym: Is there an end game?

603
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:17,475
Rym: When will the game be done?

604
00:39:17,495 --> 00:39:19,062
Rym: Mm-hmm and that our.

605
00:39:19,102 --> 00:39:20,690
Scott: what's the most you can get out of this game?

606
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:23,303
Scott: yep, and you really invest your soul into it.

607
00:39:23,344 --> 00:39:36,879
Rym: and the games that we Liked the most and continue to still like where the games that we invested our souls into we're not just that were the games that after 20 or more plays We had not we had still not plumbed the depths.

608
00:39:36,899 --> 00:39:44,202
Rym: Mm-hmm and the rules to those games were Relatively elegant or simple or airtight.

609
00:39:44,443 --> 00:39:52,948
Rym: Yeah games that were Complex or we hadn't solved that were only not solved because there are a billion different kinds of cards We lost interest in pretty quick.

610
00:39:53,331 --> 00:40:03,590
Rym: But games like like Hans the Teutonic is a good example of a much more recent game that had all those aspects that we liked so much in the games that we lauded in the 15 years of doing GeekNights.

611
00:40:04,052 --> 00:40:05,400
Scott: Danica isn't really a new game.

612
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,103
Scott: It's just new to us.

613
00:40:06,184 --> 00:40:09,128
Rym: Well, I mean it's the time I'm just gonna be like three years ago.

614
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:17,553
Rym: Maybe four is the most recent game we've reviewed where I can say confidently that we know you just reviewed race to the galaxy a game We've played a time.

615
00:40:17,674 --> 00:40:23,172
Rym: Oh, yeah, it's the most recent game that was published that we've reviewed Fully.

616
00:40:23,192 --> 00:40:26,329
Rym: hmm in my opinion like with that level of deepness.

617
00:40:27,213 --> 00:40:33,863
Scott: After that, I think the other thing is a lot of the games you review games You've played more recently like we did one potion explosion, right?

618
00:40:33,984 --> 00:40:34,506
Rym: Well, we only.

619
00:40:34,526 --> 00:40:35,610
Rym: so that's that's the other thing.

620
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:38,810
Scott: It's like we played that game a few times, but there's nothing more to get out of it.

621
00:40:39,051 --> 00:40:45,061
Scott: So we did like even though our review might not have been the greatest review you could do I think it was not like what?

622
00:40:45,081 --> 00:40:46,710
Scott: Yeah, what else could we possibly say?

623
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:49,082
Scott: There's no reason to play that game any more than we have.

624
00:40:49,142 --> 00:40:50,750
Rym: so I want to say our reviews there.

625
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:58,209
Scott: So the first reviews were doing you can do a better review of a better game because you can play a better game more And a better game usually has more to say about it.

626
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:01,206
Rym: But it shows how we evolved in terms of understanding games because they aren't.

627
00:41:01,267 --> 00:41:07,338
Rym: for years We only reviewed games that we had played ad nauseam Or games that we played once and hate it.

628
00:41:07,358 --> 00:41:07,820
Rym: Mm-hmm.

629
00:41:07,981 --> 00:41:10,934
Rym: And usually we'd say yeah, we played this once we hate it Like we did that to innovation.

630
00:41:10,974 --> 00:41:13,001
Rym: We're like, ah, yeah, I'm sure.

631
00:41:13,021 --> 00:41:16,215
Scott: yeah, I'm sure even though I don't like innovation I don't want to play it.

632
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:23,570
Scott: I'm sure if we played it a bunch more Begrudgingly that we could find a lot more to say about it and do a better.

633
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:27,143
Rym: Identically to Twilight struggle it there they're in the same class.

634
00:41:27,203 --> 00:41:32,025
Scott: if we played a bunch of Twilight struggle we could definitely do a much better review of it

635
00:41:32,729 --> 00:41:33,914
Rym: and But at the same time

636
00:41:33,954 --> 00:41:35,642
Scott: I have no desire to do so still

637
00:41:35,682 --> 00:41:40,830
Rym: served its purpose because even games We don't like we tend to do a good job of describing who the game would be for like.

638
00:41:41,312 --> 00:41:44,247
Rym: If you like this you'll like this game if you're like for us.

639
00:41:44,428 --> 00:41:52,552
Rym: Yep But then we entered this era where we were doing GeekNights like much more fervently, but we tapped that cue Like.

640
00:41:52,792 --> 00:42:00,269
Rym: so we started buying new games to play them to review and what I noticed there I didn't do that was buying games to play them.

641
00:42:00,624 --> 00:42:08,269
Rym: Yeah But we also like would make a point of like tub Reviewing them as we played them to figure them out so that we'd be capable of doing review.

642
00:42:09,014 --> 00:42:11,770
Rym: But back then we still had a lot of free time so we could sort of do that.

643
00:42:12,051 --> 00:42:16,429
Rym: So we'd say we play the games like at least ten times before we'd review them, but we wouldn't play them a hundred times now.

644
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:18,554
Rym: There was a the air after.

645
00:42:18,595 --> 00:42:24,594
Rym: that is where we got really the most interesting because we finally learned enough about games and we started Doing this around like 2009.

646
00:42:24,594 --> 00:42:39,186
Rym: I want to say okay where We seem to read the rules of a game play it half-assedly once Pretty much be 90% sure of our review and maybe play it one more time just to make sure we're not wrong.

647
00:42:39,206 --> 00:42:45,578
Rym: Mm-hmm and We were incapable of doing that for a long time And I think we just learned a lot about games.

648
00:42:45,678 --> 00:42:51,691
Rym: and once you play enough games like potion explosion You can see what's going on in that game real quick There's.

649
00:42:51,771 --> 00:42:55,493
Rym: we could literally not say more about the game by playing it more But it.

650
00:42:55,734 --> 00:43:04,069
Rym: but had we reviewed potion explosion say back in 2006 I think we would had to play it like ten more times to realize the things we realized about it.

651
00:43:05,392 --> 00:43:16,431
Rym: Yeah, and nowadays, uh We just struggle to get together a group of people outside of conventions who are willing to play super serious games super seriously Repeatedly.

652
00:43:16,492 --> 00:43:19,280
Scott: and the thing is our problem isn't that we lack friends?

653
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,068
Scott: is that everyone is actually doing other things in life.

654
00:43:22,108 --> 00:43:23,633
Rym: for reals We're like we're.

655
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:25,138
Rym: we're shockingly busy.

656
00:43:25,158 --> 00:43:28,530
Scott: Well, I just like I'd rather go biking then go and play a board game.

657
00:43:28,791 --> 00:43:29,995
Rym: Yeah, well partly cuz it's summer.

658
00:43:30,196 --> 00:43:31,701
Rym: Yes, we got some plans though.

659
00:43:31,741 --> 00:43:46,240
Rym: There's there's some tentative plans of doing a writer's retreat at some point whereas I a small group of dangerous people are gonna get together and play like 15 games and review the fuck out of without stop and play tons of games.

660
00:43:46,481 --> 00:43:47,564
Rym: That'll be review con.

661
00:43:48,145 --> 00:43:50,030
Scott: Yeah game publishers.

662
00:43:51,051 --> 00:44:00,162
Scott: Usually I don't ask for free review copies of games and especially when people people have called us mostly with books They want us to talk to the authors on the GeekNights and stuff.

663
00:44:00,343 --> 00:44:02,130
Scott: Yeah, I always turn them the fuck down.

664
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:02,331
Scott: I don't.

665
00:44:02,451 --> 00:44:07,010
Scott: actually I don't say no, but I'm like is like look you can send us all the free shit you want.

666
00:44:07,293 --> 00:44:08,849
Scott: There is no guarantee that we'll review it.

667
00:44:09,111 --> 00:44:10,983
Scott: There's no guarantee we'll review it positively.

668
00:44:11,003 --> 00:44:13,679
Scott: if we do review it I promise you basically nothing.

669
00:44:13,719 --> 00:44:15,590
Scott: but feel free to send me free stuff if you want.

670
00:44:16,212 --> 00:44:20,270
Scott: And that basically is the same thing as no don't send me free stuff, right?

671
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:24,324
Rym: Well, actually the publisher offered to send us pen Dante too because we didn't actually own it.

672
00:44:24,425 --> 00:44:25,388
Rym: Sure, but I didn't.

673
00:44:26,893 --> 00:44:30,914
Scott: You are a board game publisher We are we're.

674
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:34,931
Scott: if we do this legit, right don't send it to us until we say we're doing this But we're.

675
00:44:34,992 --> 00:44:46,898
Scott: if we do this legit, then I promise you that if you send us a game And we will play it there at least sometimes and we will review it 100% honestly if you're ready to deal with that

676
00:44:47,079 --> 00:44:50,749
Rym: like to the rule that we offer to people to pay us money to do

677
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:54,490
Scott: and We will even send you the game fucking back because I don't want to keep it in my house.

678
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:55,675
Scott: Yeah, if we don't like it.

679
00:44:56,197 --> 00:45:01,239
Scott: Yeah, you know what if I do like the game and I want to keep it I'll even give you the money to buy the game from you.

680
00:45:01,259 --> 00:45:11,215
Scott: Yeah, right if I would have bought it otherwise Right, well, you know now I'm not gonna I'm not gonna buy before I try is what I'm saying for another board game in my very Small apartment.

681
00:45:11,296 --> 00:45:12,969
Scott: So so no one out there.

682
00:45:13,795 --> 00:45:14,449
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

683
00:45:14,691 --> 00:45:21,490
Rym: So nowadays it with our current knowledge of games and you know Like we've literally we've done this a few times.

684
00:45:21,631 --> 00:45:24,764
Rym: We've put some reviews up on GeekNights where we literally just read the rules.

685
00:45:25,065 --> 00:45:25,688
Rym: That was all we did.

686
00:45:26,592 --> 00:45:27,616
Scott: Sometimes it's all you need.

687
00:45:27,918 --> 00:45:30,830
Scott: Yeah, so some people get real mad about that, right?

688
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:38,880
Scott: There was a thread on the board games reddit actually recently that was like so mad at like reviewers Like not playing the game enough and stuff like that.

689
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:41,007
Scott: and it's like look, you know, you know on this.

690
00:45:41,088 --> 00:45:42,616
Scott: on the one hand It's true.

691
00:45:42,797 --> 00:45:44,430
Scott: You shouldn't judge a book by its cover.

692
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:49,498
Scott: This is why we do the judge anime by its cover panel, right and we say this at that panel The rule book is the whole book.

693
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:53,644
Scott: That's what listen, you know Judging anything by its cover.

694
00:45:54,167 --> 00:45:58,743
Scott: It's true You shouldn't judge things by their cover because you will not always be right.

695
00:45:59,145 --> 00:46:00,489
Scott: you will often be.

696
00:46:00,629 --> 00:46:02,217
Scott: you know Oh, this looks like crap.

697
00:46:02,257 --> 00:46:04,186
Scott: And then if you actually had played it you would have realized.

698
00:46:04,367 --> 00:46:05,110
Scott: Oh, no, it was great.

699
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:05,974
Scott: You look at some food.

700
00:46:06,014 --> 00:46:06,858
Scott: that food looks ugly.

701
00:46:06,898 --> 00:46:07,260
Scott: Oh my god.

702
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:08,003
Scott: It tastes delicious.

703
00:46:08,064 --> 00:46:09,450
Scott: It was what's that green slime?

704
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:10,153
Scott: It's guac.

705
00:46:10,535 --> 00:46:11,038
Scott: You just did.

706
00:46:11,058 --> 00:46:12,486
Scott: you just judged it by how it looked.

707
00:46:12,526 --> 00:46:13,130
Scott: what's wrong with you?

708
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:19,553
Scott: Yeah But at the same time the fact is if you judge things by their cover You will be right.

709
00:46:19,593 --> 00:46:21,038
Scott: like 90 plus percent of the time.

710
00:46:21,299 --> 00:46:23,005
Scott: romance novels look like romance novels.

711
00:46:23,045 --> 00:46:24,630
Scott: trashy sci-fi books look like Travis.

712
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:29,630
Scott: I've had books right pulp fight and fantasy novels look like pulp fantasy novels almost all the time.

713
00:46:29,932 --> 00:46:32,149
Scott: You can judge things by how they look almost all the time.

714
00:46:32,651 --> 00:46:47,343
Scott: so if you judge something based on one playthrough or a reading of the rules and it's a game and Depending on how much your understanding of games is and we're gonna just you know Be I guess arrogant and say we have an amazing understanding of games.

715
00:46:47,544 --> 00:46:47,925
Scott: We're great.

716
00:46:47,945 --> 00:47:00,133
Scott: Yeah, if you we can we are skilled talented and knowledgeable enough to judge things in areas where we are experts with less Experience.

717
00:47:00,153 --> 00:47:01,477
Rym: with the same point.

718
00:47:01,577 --> 00:47:05,690
Rym: I looked we we reviewed eccentric family on judge anime by its cover.

719
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:08,358
Rym: You know we said mm-hmm exactly 100% correct.

720
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:10,044
Rym: All right show is exactly what we said.

721
00:47:10,064 --> 00:47:11,267
Rym: It would be terrific.

722
00:47:11,749 --> 00:47:19,841
Rym: So today When we review games, I've we definitely Review games from the perspective of people like us.

723
00:47:20,223 --> 00:47:20,383
Scott: Mm-hmm.

724
00:47:20,785 --> 00:47:22,130
Scott: Well, that's how everyone reviews things.

725
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:27,265
Rym: They review it from the perspective of people like them Yep And the but a lot of people try to pretend they don't which is kind of.

726
00:47:27,285 --> 00:47:35,602
Scott: I will sometimes Remember to say things like if you're this kind of person though, you might like this like there's a lot of games I know that are like all theme and no substance.

727
00:47:35,944 --> 00:47:39,830
Scott: and if I look if you really love that Like, you know this fucking theme you'll probably love this shit.

728
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:40,553
Scott: But I don't like.

729
00:47:40,593 --> 00:47:44,270
Scott: if you're some, you know, I'll be like, oh if you're a grognard, you'll love this Twilight struggle, but I don't.

730
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:51,007
Rym: But I've also noticed that the specific factors we look for in a tabletop game are actually pretty simple.

731
00:47:51,408 --> 00:47:54,330
Rym: are the rules Well written is like are they unambiguous?

732
00:47:55,514 --> 00:47:56,750
Rym: Like that is number one.

733
00:47:56,972 --> 00:47:58,969
Scott: I need to go to board game geek for a fact.

734
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:03,450
Rym: But if there if the rules to a game are ambiguous like usually we don't even review it.

735
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:06,950
Rym: We just like cut it out of our brains and never look at it again.

736
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:08,413
Scott: Yeah, like there's unplayable garbage.

737
00:48:08,453 --> 00:48:09,235
Rym: It's like I picked up.

738
00:48:09,255 --> 00:48:11,419
Scott: that's like trying to play a game on Steam and it crashes.

739
00:48:11,459 --> 00:48:23,048
Rym: It's like yep Literally picked up games at PAX like I'll grab random games sometimes just start reading the rules to see if we'll play it at The table like between things and I put them back when I couldn't resolve a rule question on my own reading.

740
00:48:23,228 --> 00:48:26,901
Rym: Mm-hmm Number two is there's two sort of kinds of games.

741
00:48:26,921 --> 00:48:29,430
Rym: We look at German style like Euro tabletop games.

742
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:30,677
Rym: So that's mostly what we review.

743
00:48:31,361 --> 00:48:32,790
Rym: Are they primarily?

744
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:37,709
Rym: Optimization or machine driven or are they primarily?

745
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:40,093
Rym: exploratory meaning?

746
00:48:40,594 --> 00:48:46,048
Rym: are there dense mechanics that you're expected to explore and play repeatedly to understand?

747
00:48:46,068 --> 00:48:51,649
Rym: or are there Mechanics that you can logically figure out and build complex machines in your head with mm-hmm?

748
00:48:52,271 --> 00:48:54,639
Scott: He takers in your phrase is exploratory, right?

749
00:48:54,659 --> 00:49:04,630
Scott: You have a few pieces to work with placing tiles catastrophes Monuments, right and you have to explore different ways to use those pieces as you play it multiple times.

750
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:07,317
Scott: Right, and that's how the game works.

751
00:49:07,378 --> 00:49:11,317
Scott: But if you look at a game like say Puerto Rico, it's like well There's nothing to explore.

752
00:49:11,337 --> 00:49:12,689
Scott: You can see all the buildings right there.

753
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:17,448
Scott: Yeah, you just had to figure out or Agricola or any of these types of games, right?

754
00:49:17,488 --> 00:49:18,738
Scott: It's like alright Here's all the pieces.

755
00:49:18,779 --> 00:49:20,853
Scott: They're spelled out in English What?

756
00:49:21,033 --> 00:49:29,707
Scott: how to build an optimal machine given the fact that you're competing for machine parts with other people and such and such and Such and all these cards and stuff, you know?

757
00:49:30,171 --> 00:49:34,085
Scott: And in and then when do you start cranking that machine to spin out victory points?

758
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:35,530
Scott: and how hard can you crank it?

759
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:45,430
Rym: If a game is exploratory We expect it to be elegant meaning The fewest number of rules to achieve the most complexity with those rules.

760
00:49:45,891 --> 00:49:50,807
Rym: So if a game is super complex, but it has a billion unique cards to make it complex.

761
00:49:51,188 --> 00:49:53,698
Rym: F that noise That's an that's inelegant complexity.

762
00:49:53,718 --> 00:49:54,461
Scott: That's that's like.

763
00:49:54,802 --> 00:49:56,128
Scott: that's like a lot of PC games.

764
00:49:56,228 --> 00:49:57,615
Rym: Oh my god I wish I could quote it.

765
00:49:57,635 --> 00:50:01,890
Rym: There was a talk at PAX dev last year actually on this topic That was super great.

766
00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:07,490
Scott: Like if you look at a lot of 5x games or 4x games on the PC or like, you know Europe universalis is the greatest.

767
00:50:09,514 --> 00:50:22,130
Scott: That is a deep and complex game sure But it's like it's just tons and tons of numbers and graphs and so much Shit, it's like you cannot put all of that information into a human brain unless you're you know, especially powered.

768
00:50:22,170 --> 00:50:28,829
Scott: Yeah, right much more smarter than I am Smarter that you'll say you won't say stupid things like more smarter.

769
00:50:29,291 --> 00:50:58,978
Rym: but any sort of game that has that sort of exploratory bent to it if The mechanics are too complicated in light of how complicated the actual strategies are That is that is our main criteria I think like above all others and I think secondary to that is the fun economy because even if the game is dumb and broken and everything if it's short and we had a Moderate amount of fun in that very short time.

770
00:50:59,299 --> 00:51:02,170
Rym: Well also rated very highly even if it fails all these other categories.

771
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:06,689
Scott: Yeah, I mean there's a lot of games like that because especially, you know, just the social situations that we're in.

772
00:51:07,091 --> 00:51:17,288
Scott: You know you get a game like say red seven like not a masterpiece by any means but it's like oh But it's fun enough for five minutes that it takes to play and it's like a calm.

773
00:51:17,308 --> 00:51:19,169
Scott: played again I could play the red seven right the fuck now.

774
00:51:19,431 --> 00:51:34,930
Rym: So a game that has reasonable like a game that has high depth low complexity to achieve that depth Short time play like time span to play but a good experience in that time That's like the perfectly designed game our like basic rubric, right?

775
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:35,233
Scott: It's all.

776
00:51:35,274 --> 00:51:35,840
Scott: it's all about.

777
00:51:35,901 --> 00:51:36,386
Scott: you know in.

778
00:51:36,487 --> 00:51:40,290
Scott: you know How much you have to invest to play the game versus what you get out of it, right?

779
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:41,849
Scott: So you only have to invest a little bit.

780
00:51:42,171 --> 00:51:45,764
Scott: You don't need to get that much out for it to be good and worth your time.

781
00:51:46,065 --> 00:51:51,483
Scott: if you have to invest a lot To get you know, not so much, you know, that's not so great.

782
00:51:51,764 --> 00:51:52,507
Scott: You know eat like.

783
00:51:52,747 --> 00:51:53,570
Scott: so I think what happens?

784
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:59,210
Scott: I think there are a lot of games out there where you still have a positive experience playing them, right?

785
00:51:59,551 --> 00:52:07,557
Scott: So if you you invest like an hour of time and a bunch of work studying rules and you get fun out of it It's like positive experience.

786
00:52:07,577 --> 00:52:12,721
Scott: It's a good time and I think other people would be like, wow This is a really good time and they'll rate it really highly.

787
00:52:12,741 --> 00:52:16,114
Scott: where I'll be like, no, it wasn't worth the trouble Even though it's good, right?

788
00:52:16,175 --> 00:52:17,438
Scott: We'll rate that game badly.

789
00:52:17,579 --> 00:52:18,561
Scott: Whereas other people won't.

790
00:52:18,822 --> 00:52:19,003
Rym: Yep.

791
00:52:19,584 --> 00:52:29,950
Rym: We also there's the if a game is reactive or not meaning if there's multiple players How interactive is the game and how much do you have to react to what other players are doing?

792
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:32,090
Rym: Like how much do other players affect the state of the game?

793
00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:38,602
Scott: We're definitely you know, that's just our personal taste I think is we don't tend to like games that are straight races as much.

794
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:39,526
Scott: Yep, right.

795
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:40,971
Rym: They're good filler games Like.

796
00:52:41,011 --> 00:52:43,525
Rym: I actually liked that America game where we were just like writing.

797
00:52:43,585 --> 00:52:47,108
Scott: that's not a race This computer competing for the spots in turn order.

798
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:52,890
Rym: No, no, no, no, not that not the trivia game the one with like you're right the numbers on the map.

799
00:52:53,332 --> 00:52:54,256
Scott: Oh, yeah, that's just a race.

800
00:52:54,276 --> 00:52:55,542
Rym: That's just a solitaire race.

801
00:52:55,683 --> 00:52:57,230
Scott: Oh, yeah, we didn't talk about that game on the show.

802
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:59,100
Rym: Oh, no, we didn't but I think we did.

803
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:03,586
Scott: Yeah, you know a race, you know You're not supposed to touch the other racers when you're doing 100 meter - right?

804
00:53:04,570 --> 00:53:13,630
Scott: There's a lot of board games and other video games Competitive games in general that are just races where it's like everyone's playing solitaire and at the end who does the best solitaire?

805
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:15,977
Rym: Right that has a time and place.

806
00:53:16,038 --> 00:53:20,778
Rym: like if you have if you want a game that holds a large number of players That is the optimal way to do it.

807
00:53:20,999 --> 00:53:21,180
Rym: Mm-hmm.

808
00:53:21,341 --> 00:53:23,068
Rym: and there's that there's a time and a place for that.

809
00:53:23,148 --> 00:53:28,330
Scott: Candyland Is that never everyone's playing Candyland at the same time and whoever gets to the end first wins.

810
00:53:28,592 --> 00:53:30,043
Scott: So the game is literally a race.

811
00:53:30,103 --> 00:53:33,498
Rym: if a game is a race We sort of review it from the perspective of.

812
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:42,190
Rym: is the puzzle I am working on myself fun Mm-hmm, and is the socialization that occurs around that mechanic fun?

813
00:53:42,692 --> 00:53:46,710
Scott: And also how many times is solving the puzzle gonna be fun, right?

814
00:53:47,513 --> 00:53:53,015
Scott: Or if I've played it once if I is that ball I need I don't need to play it again because I've already figured out Rolling America, that's the name of that one.

815
00:53:53,055 --> 00:53:56,085
Rym: I've already figured Chris and Pat both simultaneously.

816
00:53:56,105 --> 00:53:57,209
Rym: We're like rolling America, right?

817
00:53:57,610 --> 00:53:57,852
Scott: It's like.

818
00:53:58,053 --> 00:54:00,490
Scott: have I already figured out the fastest way to run this race?

819
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:01,788
Scott: Well, then I never need to run it again.

820
00:54:02,172 --> 00:54:19,114
Rym: But if a game is interaction with other people Right as the Judonica and Tigger's new phrases are good examples there in that pretty much every most games most multiplayer game but if it's highly interactive I've noticed we Heavily dislike games that are also highly political Mm-hmm, like.

821
00:54:19,154 --> 00:54:23,490
Scott: well, every game is technically political it is but you can do based on the rules.

822
00:54:23,752 --> 00:54:26,290
Scott: The influence of the politics can be higher or lower.

823
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:31,087
Rym: Well, like Hansa, Judonica and Puerto Rico are both good examples of games that are like.

824
00:54:31,388 --> 00:54:36,467
Rym: the actions You're going to take are deeply dependent upon the game state created by the decisions.

825
00:54:36,527 --> 00:54:37,270
Rym: Everyone else is made.

826
00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:39,810
Scott: But you know Hansa is highly political, right?

827
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:44,345
Scott: It's like I can choose to attack Rym by messing with him But I think it's actually way less political.

828
00:54:44,365 --> 00:54:44,950
Rym: but you can't.

829
00:54:46,551 --> 00:54:49,481
Scott: There's a limit to your power and how much you can mess.

830
00:54:49,521 --> 00:55:02,448
Scott: you would need to have unity gang up on someone to ruin them And most you can't really afford to gang up on someone and sacrifice your own biz Whereas something like I'm not gonna say diplomacy something else like the scythe game, which is basically diplomacy.

831
00:55:02,468 --> 00:55:05,216
Scott: Yeah, right That's just basically a hundred percent political.

832
00:55:05,296 --> 00:55:06,660
Scott: It's really the vote who wins.

833
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:13,276
Rym: You said I we like games that are highly interactive But have minimal Political.

834
00:55:13,417 --> 00:55:25,430
Scott: there is still political interaction But your ability to the influence the influence of the political interaction on the victory condition is lesser Right than it could be because the rules are restrictive.

835
00:55:25,711 --> 00:55:30,430
Rym: Yeah, so the more the more the politics turns into risk the less we're interested in it.

836
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:37,056
Rym: Mm-hmm in terms of the machine games like, you know the straight-up crank the machine like Sulkin like that kind of game.

837
00:55:37,076 --> 00:55:38,843
Rym: you literally crank the berserk in here.

838
00:55:38,883 --> 00:55:39,546
Scott: Literally crank it.

839
00:55:39,566 --> 00:55:40,470
Rym: Yeah, I do like Salkin.

840
00:55:41,072 --> 00:55:42,336
Scott: I only played it half a time.

841
00:55:42,557 --> 00:55:45,407
Rym: I played it three times now and I actually like it more.

842
00:55:45,428 --> 00:55:47,137
Scott: Yeah I'm definitely something up.

843
00:55:47,157 --> 00:55:47,922
Rym: We should play this out.

844
00:55:48,063 --> 00:55:48,506
Scott: I feel it.

845
00:55:48,687 --> 00:55:49,110
Rym: Let's play it.

846
00:55:49,130 --> 00:55:51,042
Rym: I don't want to buy it, but I'm sure it'll be there.

847
00:55:51,063 --> 00:55:52,009
Scott: I definitely have room to keep it.

848
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:58,490
Rym: No, but I crystal skulls them or Kayla's any kind of game where there's sort of a machine of any kind that you can make.

849
00:55:59,211 --> 00:56:18,670
Rym: I noticed we tend to prefer the games where there are a. There are multiple paths to victory and some nuance to how you Optimize between them because I've noticed a lot of the games we don't like that We never reviewed on GeekNights because we're playing once in a packs and we're just not excited about them tend to be machine games.

850
00:56:19,112 --> 00:56:20,400
Rym: A lot of them have trained themes.

851
00:56:20,461 --> 00:56:21,044
Rym: I've noticed.

852
00:56:21,065 --> 00:56:27,150
Rym: Mm-hmm where There are like three ways to go and they're basically all mutually exclusive.

853
00:56:27,712 --> 00:56:33,150
Rym: Yeah, this I go after the gold points or the potion points or the hat points.

854
00:56:33,491 --> 00:56:36,661
Rym: But if you do one hat and three potions, there's literally no way you can win.

855
00:56:36,762 --> 00:56:37,785
Scott: Yeah, it's like we've.

856
00:56:38,106 --> 00:56:39,270
Scott: we've built three efficient.

857
00:56:39,350 --> 00:56:43,830
Scott: There's a bunch of pieces here to build machines with right and it's basically three machines.

858
00:56:44,372 --> 00:56:48,370
Scott: If you tried to build any one of the three machines, they're all pretty much equally efficient.

859
00:56:48,692 --> 00:56:55,629
Scott: But if you try to build a combination of more than one machine The efficiency is gone and you're not gonna get enough points if someone else just concentrates on one machine.

860
00:56:55,871 --> 00:56:57,098
Scott: Yeah, that's the first problem.

861
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:59,130
Scott: Another problem is some games.

862
00:56:59,653 --> 00:57:07,290
Scott: They have multiple machines or ways to build the machine But one of them is vastly more efficient than the others and off usually there's not enough parts to go around.

863
00:57:07,571 --> 00:57:12,468
Scott: So one person gets the efficient machine and everyone else gets a subpar machine and they've already been there already.

864
00:57:12,488 --> 00:57:13,735
Scott: the winner as soon As they held that one.

865
00:57:14,078 --> 00:57:15,650
Scott: I made the first baby in a curricula.

866
00:57:15,710 --> 00:57:22,665
Scott: Well, you're not guaranteed to win but that's like you're far along Much further along than the other players.

867
00:57:22,826 --> 00:57:25,596
Scott: Yeah What are the other?

868
00:57:25,616 --> 00:57:35,329
Scott: but you know a good machine building game has many different and interesting ways to build the machine in different combinations that can all work.

869
00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:37,924
Scott: and Also, they offer ways.

870
00:57:38,186 --> 00:57:44,230
Scott: for example Maybe I realize in some games like maybe in race to the gals about I think that's where I was going.

871
00:57:44,951 --> 00:57:46,970
Scott: Galaxy, maybe I realize huh?

872
00:57:47,851 --> 00:57:49,700
Scott: Rims got an efficient machine going.

873
00:57:50,042 --> 00:57:55,703
Scott: my machine is much less efficient But now you know what rooms gonna do it because my machine is less efficient.

874
00:57:55,803 --> 00:58:01,344
Scott: Maybe I can crank it harder Starting earlier and get as many victory points.

875
00:58:01,605 --> 00:58:02,790
Scott: at the moment the game ends.

876
00:58:02,870 --> 00:58:03,653
Scott: So I'll just start going.

877
00:58:03,954 --> 00:58:07,990
Scott: consume consume consume consume because I can't do what he's doing.

878
00:58:08,311 --> 00:58:10,518
Rym: Yeah, and there's another way to go.

879
00:58:10,558 --> 00:58:16,358
Rym: you see that I'm doing a strategy where I'll be producing semi regularly So you can assume that that'll happen.

880
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:19,590
Rym: never produce and build around using the fruits of production.

881
00:58:19,771 --> 00:58:21,890
Scott: Yep, so you find some other way.

882
00:58:21,910 --> 00:58:23,841
Scott: There's always some other way to win and the gate.

883
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:25,350
Scott: we don't like games that you know.

884
00:58:25,530 --> 00:58:30,389
Scott: It's the thing we think I've complained about and a lot of reviews like this game ends before it ends.

885
00:58:30,671 --> 00:58:33,070
Scott: Yeah, there's a lot of games have that problem.

886
00:58:33,150 --> 00:58:42,989
Rym: It's super common look at gate like look at when we play Puerto Rico or Tigris new Freighties or honestly The game is up in the air until like the second to last turn pretty close to the end.

887
00:58:43,009 --> 00:58:47,123
Rym: Yeah Yeah, Hanza in particular ends up often being shockingly close.

888
00:58:47,203 --> 00:58:50,436
Rym: Yeah, it's where you know, even though Hanza has problems It's not my favorite game.

889
00:58:50,456 --> 00:59:03,502
Rym: I use it as an example because what it is Shockingly elegant in what it has accomplished in terms of barely political player interaction Especially among skilled players because there is a cost to playing highly public.

890
00:59:03,522 --> 00:59:11,970
Scott: if you play that game politically you tear yourself down Deeply and usually the way to accomplish this when you make a game is to do is to is it goes hand in hand with?

891
00:59:12,070 --> 00:59:16,729
Scott: Another thing I complain about which is games often have like big pieces like in Puerto Rico.

892
00:59:16,749 --> 00:59:18,857
Rym: you big Park steampunk has.

893
00:59:18,897 --> 00:59:22,110
Rym: well steampunk has physically big pieces for no good reason, right?

894
00:59:22,290 --> 00:59:31,027
Scott: And it has things you'll never build but it's like, you know There's always like the big guy like in magic the gathering you have like the big creature Right the legend that takes black and green.

895
00:59:31,107 --> 00:59:36,030
Scott: Yeah There'll be something, you know, just something big right and usually a good game.

896
00:59:36,271 --> 00:59:41,578
Scott: you can play the big thing close to the end and Use it a few times and then the game ends.

897
00:59:41,899 --> 01:00:02,090
Scott: and that is a good thing because it means you can actually be behind most of the game and invest in building the big thing as an alternative to just playing efficiently throughout the game and that Big thing will come out and actually do some work before the game ends Thus allowing you to possibly catch up to the people who were playing the smaller or other medium-sized strategies, right?

898
01:00:02,370 --> 01:00:07,654
Scott: Yeah, whereas a lot of games I've noticed you can't even play the big thing Unless it's a miracle.

899
01:00:08,096 --> 01:00:13,077
Scott: and even if you do play the big thing like that will be the last turn of the game and you'll Maybe use it once if you're lucky.

900
01:00:13,097 --> 01:00:14,846
Scott: and that's you know, what was it?

901
01:00:15,108 --> 01:00:17,609
Scott: Oh my good I just will not have put that thing in the game.

902
01:00:17,770 --> 01:00:22,330
Rym: Oh my goods doesn't have that have the rule where at the end of the game you crank your machine twice.

903
01:00:22,551 --> 01:00:24,397
Scott: Yeah, and oh my goods.

904
01:00:24,437 --> 01:00:25,761
Scott: It's like at the very end of the game.

905
01:00:25,781 --> 01:00:28,550
Scott: Everyone gets to crank their machine one extra time.

906
01:00:28,670 --> 01:00:33,110
Scott: So it really gives you that incentive like oh you can build something really big at the end of the game.

907
01:00:33,333 --> 01:00:38,704
Scott: I made a bunch of windows And actually use them and not just have the game end on you.

908
01:00:38,865 --> 01:00:40,330
Rym: Yep, cuz I remember Kayla.

909
01:00:40,651 --> 01:00:41,857
Scott: That's the thing that we really like.

910
01:00:42,018 --> 01:00:49,490
Rym: like Kayla's feel that arguably the first worker placement game Which we were obsessed with because back when it came out the first worker placement game arguably it is Really?

911
01:00:50,330 --> 01:00:51,093
Rym: worker placement game.

912
01:00:51,113 --> 01:00:54,084
Scott: before there had to be name one there had to be.

913
01:00:54,144 --> 01:00:55,810
Scott: that can't be the first worker placement game.

914
01:00:56,913 --> 01:00:57,686
Scott: There's no way.

915
01:00:59,593 --> 01:01:01,408
Rym: What was the first worker placement game?

916
01:01:02,770 --> 01:01:03,570
Rym: Kayla's really.

917
01:01:04,811 --> 01:01:10,930
Rym: Maybe there's an old game called bus that might have predated it really but bus is from 1999.

918
01:01:10,930 --> 01:01:13,086
Scott: Kayla's really the first I did.

919
01:01:13,147 --> 01:01:18,217
Rym: we've talked Whoa Valley of the Mammoths, that's the one.

920
01:01:18,237 --> 01:01:18,920
Rym: I forgot about that.

921
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:19,522
Rym: So I never.

922
01:01:19,582 --> 01:01:20,346
Scott: I never heard of that.

923
01:01:20,366 --> 01:01:22,171
Rym: That's all this from 91.

924
01:01:22,171 --> 01:01:23,357
Scott: I never seen that in my life.

925
01:01:24,141 --> 01:01:24,784
Rym: I don't know if I've.

926
01:01:25,990 --> 01:01:27,640
Rym: I Don't know if I've seen this game or not.

927
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:28,163
Rym: I've never.

928
01:01:28,204 --> 01:01:29,210
Scott: I've never seen that.

929
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:33,203
Rym: I think my brain is conflating but my brain wants pictures with tempest.

930
01:01:33,363 --> 01:01:35,229
Scott: Yeah, they're not but my brain wants to play it.

931
01:01:35,671 --> 01:01:36,797
Scott: Yeah, it definitely looks like.

932
01:01:36,857 --> 01:01:37,420
Rym: I want to play that.

933
01:01:37,681 --> 01:01:37,922
Rym: Actually.

934
01:01:37,942 --> 01:01:39,590
Rym: I want to play tempest again - it's been a while.

935
01:01:39,590 --> 01:01:40,542
Scott: I'll play tempest and Vinci.

936
01:01:40,724 --> 01:01:50,003
Rym: Yeah But yeah, so that game had the problem where there are a bunch of big things that you pretty much never be able to build You're not gonna get that much stone ever.

937
01:01:50,144 --> 01:01:50,305
Scott: Mm-hmm.

938
01:01:51,332 --> 01:01:52,844
Scott: So unless you get the miracle play.

939
01:01:53,328 --> 01:01:53,590
Scott: Oh, yeah.

940
01:01:55,442 --> 01:02:04,338
Rym: So Otherwise, I think the main thing that we've reviewed pretty heavily is you sort of get a sense of One whether or not they actually play tested their fucking game.

941
01:02:04,358 --> 01:02:04,800
Scott: Mm-hmm.

942
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:09,132
Rym: and two whether or not they play tested with a wide audience.

943
01:02:09,473 --> 01:02:18,670
Rym: because a lot of new tabletop games partly because the industry sort of been democratized and a lot of people like The barrier to entry to tabletop is pretty low these days.

944
01:02:18,670 --> 01:02:21,200
Scott: There was a thread on working geek reddit about that.

945
01:02:21,221 --> 01:02:28,910
Scott: was some guy was like with no evidence whatsoever By the way was claiming that listen you guys keep complaining about Kickstarter exclusive shit.

946
01:02:29,251 --> 01:02:33,790
Scott: But you have to include exclusive shit on your Kickstarter or people won't buy your Kickstarter.

947
01:02:33,911 --> 01:02:39,881
Scott: they'll just wait for the regular edition because it's the same damn thing and it's like You don't have any evidence of that.

948
01:02:39,901 --> 01:02:40,890
Scott: Show me the sales figures.

949
01:02:41,203 --> 01:02:43,509
Scott: Yeah right but in that thread.

950
01:02:44,171 --> 01:03:01,770
Scott: The thing that's relevant is so many people in that thread so much of the people in the board game hobby in the community are really really interested and like fancy pieces and And the construction of the games and extra minis.

951
01:03:01,790 --> 01:03:04,504
Rym: We basically don't care about that at all and we give no I give me the.

952
01:03:04,544 --> 01:03:05,730
Rym: you know what I say about that.

953
01:03:05,851 --> 01:03:12,480
Rym: Usually if the pieces are particularly amazing We'll say the game's really well constructed.

954
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:17,276
Scott: Yeah, but like I give no shits about that whatsoever Give me the cardboard shits.

955
01:03:17,336 --> 01:03:19,805
Scott: Give me the you know, the plain old dice.

956
01:03:19,905 --> 01:03:21,150
Scott: I don't give it's I care about.

957
01:03:21,331 --> 01:03:22,315
Rym: You know what I'll complain about.

958
01:03:22,335 --> 01:03:25,570
Rym: I rarely like paper money because it's a pain in the ass.

959
01:03:25,651 --> 01:03:27,891
Scott: Sure, right and some you know We talked.

960
01:03:27,911 --> 01:03:29,636
Scott: we do talk about construction a little bit.

961
01:03:30,017 --> 01:03:33,387
Scott: only if all their board game reviewers talk about construction.

962
01:03:33,407 --> 01:03:46,410
Scott: a lot Your factor for them and a lot of people buy and enjoy board games Based on the construction and we give almost that factors into our view like almost not at all.

963
01:03:46,450 --> 01:03:58,310
Scott: So yeah, there's a lot of shitty games out there site that are really ridiculously on you know Undeservingly popular because of their construction getting them a huge amount of sales.

964
01:03:58,531 --> 01:04:03,348
Rym: Well, it's like all those anime because they talk about the liner notes and the quality of the truck.

965
01:04:03,368 --> 01:04:11,468
Scott: that right I also think what happens is that a game with quality construction gets big sales from that part of the community.

966
01:04:11,488 --> 01:04:14,619
Scott: and Because now the game is popular and everywhere.

967
01:04:14,639 --> 01:04:21,421
Scott: It's spilled, you know, it's yeah, it spills over into That terrible Ghostbusters game.

968
01:04:21,762 --> 01:04:22,183
Rym: cuz it's a.

969
01:04:22,564 --> 01:04:24,370
Scott: I don't think that many people bought it.

970
01:04:24,811 --> 01:04:28,344
Rym: So it's a lot of people bought it like a lot how many?

971
01:04:28,545 --> 01:04:29,810
Rym: but well they all bought it on the Kickstarter.

972
01:04:29,930 --> 01:04:32,703
Scott: No one bought it after that guys to this day.

973
01:04:32,783 --> 01:04:34,993
Rym: I've never seen someone play it at a con Ever.

974
01:04:35,355 --> 01:04:37,024
Scott: no, because it's not that many of us.

975
01:04:37,044 --> 01:04:40,484
Rym: they bought it for the pieces Which aren't even that paintable as far as I can tell.

976
01:04:40,504 --> 01:04:41,530
Scott: we give no shits about peace.

977
01:04:41,530 --> 01:04:48,010
Rym: Yeah, so basically it'll be a. it'll be like it'll be a negative if the pieces in like hinder the gameplay in some way.

978
01:04:48,153 --> 01:04:56,150
Rym: Oh, yeah We'll actually talk a lot more about graphic design than the physical construction because a lot of games have graphic design.

979
01:04:56,230 --> 01:04:57,116
Rym: That is very poor.

980
01:04:57,217 --> 01:04:58,102
Scott: sentinels a multiverse.

981
01:04:58,122 --> 01:04:58,927
Scott: Your art is the worst.

982
01:04:58,947 --> 01:05:01,215
Scott: I don't know I can't.

983
01:05:01,255 --> 01:05:01,998
Scott: I mean, it's not though.

984
01:05:02,058 --> 01:05:03,402
Scott: Literally the word is not great.

985
01:05:03,462 --> 01:05:03,943
Scott: It's awful.

986
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:06,250
Scott: Why can't people just admit it and come out with it?

987
01:05:06,630 --> 01:05:08,095
Scott: I'm like the only one who notices like.

988
01:05:08,135 --> 01:05:10,323
Scott: I feel like I'm like it's one of those situations.

989
01:05:10,364 --> 01:05:13,616
Scott: Yeah, like it's like a. they live Where I'm like.

990
01:05:13,918 --> 01:05:15,167
Scott: people think this art is good.

991
01:05:15,208 --> 01:05:19,073
Scott: It's like Overall.

992
01:05:19,213 --> 01:05:28,195
Scott: I know that I can't draw for shit but like if I practiced drawing For like a month I could do better Sentinels.

993
01:05:28,215 --> 01:05:29,640
Rym: is that the graphic design of like?

994
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:32,950
Rym: the you like the UX like the way the cards are actually laid out just is not.

995
01:05:33,151 --> 01:05:34,076
Scott: It's not a good game, right?

996
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:35,444
Scott: And it's not good.

997
01:05:35,725 --> 01:05:37,092
Rym: the character art It's not.

998
01:05:37,172 --> 01:05:37,413
Rym: I'm not.

999
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:37,553
Rym: just.

1000
01:05:37,573 --> 01:05:44,601
Rym: not so much that it's bad is that it's way like it goes off model like anytime I see it Like everyone looks like they're drawn differently.

1001
01:05:44,621 --> 01:05:46,630
Scott: Listen, Rob Liefeld draws better than whoever draws.

1002
01:05:48,158 --> 01:05:51,737
Rym: I'm not saying I'm talking about the graphic design of like.

1003
01:05:51,757 --> 01:05:55,830
Rym: was that game we played where you have the nobles like the Vienna Hotel or something?

1004
01:05:56,493 --> 01:05:57,056
Rym: That was okay.

1005
01:05:57,257 --> 01:06:01,956
Rym: Yeah, but the design of the cards made it off Hotel to read.

1006
01:06:01,976 --> 01:06:03,862
Scott: I didn't have a problem with what they were.

1007
01:06:03,882 --> 01:06:06,710
Scott: so I have a problem with like old glory to Rome old printing.

1008
01:06:06,912 --> 01:06:11,358
Rym: Well, that's that so old glory to Rome Physically hurts my brain to look at.

1009
01:06:11,378 --> 01:06:12,202
Scott: that's what I'm saying.

1010
01:06:12,322 --> 01:06:21,590
Rym: But a lot of games just have Poorly done like subtle parts of their graphic design like the sewer card in the new glory to Rome.

1011
01:06:21,791 --> 01:06:23,259
Scott: Yeah, that's I mean, but that doesn't it.

1012
01:06:23,682 --> 01:06:27,470
Scott: that just hurts your eye But it doesn't make it impossible to play in any way.

1013
01:06:27,570 --> 01:06:35,030
Rym: Yeah, but then there's also a lot of games that poorly distinguish aspects of the board that are interactive or relevant to the game.

1014
01:06:35,171 --> 01:06:37,080
Scott: Is that country bordering that country?

1015
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:38,829
Scott: How many games do you have to ask that question?

1016
01:06:38,949 --> 01:06:44,390
Rym: Yeah Why did you use a cursive script to describe the names of those people that I need to look up constantly in this game?

1017
01:06:44,950 --> 01:06:45,151
Scott: Mm-hmm.

1018
01:06:45,272 --> 01:06:46,097
Rym: So that's a problem.

1019
01:06:46,137 --> 01:06:47,625
Scott: But otherwise, why did you use that font?

1020
01:06:47,665 --> 01:06:48,490
Scott: That's not legible.

1021
01:06:48,911 --> 01:06:50,557
Rym: Yeah, where'd you even get that fun?

1022
01:06:50,858 --> 01:06:52,605
Rym: You went out of your way to find the worst possible.

1023
01:06:52,645 --> 01:06:53,970
Scott: Is that a one or a seven?

1024
01:06:56,565 --> 01:06:57,436
Rym: And What else?

1025
01:06:57,557 --> 01:06:58,503
Rym: what else we care about that?

1026
01:06:58,665 --> 01:07:07,366
Rym: because that's pretty much it the play testing things probably in the end one of the most critical ones because You can sort of tell right away if a game wasn't play.

1027
01:07:07,406 --> 01:07:08,270
Rym: tested that thoroughly.

1028
01:07:09,053 --> 01:07:17,026
Scott: You can definitely tell right away when the game says right on the front this we didn't notice this at all But because that game was honest, it was good.

1029
01:07:17,147 --> 01:07:17,930
Scott: We should make a game.

1030
01:07:18,010 --> 01:07:27,516
Scott: I wonder if we can get sued if we made a game that saying we play tested this way too goddamn much We play tested that fuck out of this game And that's the name of the game.

1031
01:07:27,556 --> 01:07:34,045
Rym: is we play tested the fuck out of this and think but they make the games So utterly simple that that's why it's perfect because there's barely a game there.

1032
01:07:34,065 --> 01:07:42,234
Rym: No, it's cops And it's just.

1033
01:07:42,455 --> 01:07:47,592
Rym: it's just white cards with the numbers printed on them, yes Really?

1034
01:07:47,612 --> 01:07:48,979
Rym: That would be a really nice font though.

1035
01:07:49,582 --> 01:07:51,350
Scott: We can make them like the best goddamn cards, right?

1036
01:07:51,390 --> 01:07:56,812
Scott: We'd have the red the red deck and the blue deck for the players and then the gold deck would be the points that you Bit up.

1037
01:07:56,972 --> 01:08:02,233
Scott: they'd be nice and big and we like me old lead to make it nice and even instead of going to 13 We'll go to 15.

1038
01:08:02,233 --> 01:08:05,695
Rym: Yeah, I Don't know we'd have to play.

1039
01:08:05,715 --> 01:08:06,157
Rym: test that.

1040
01:08:06,379 --> 01:08:06,943
Scott: Yeah, we play.

1041
01:08:06,963 --> 01:08:07,748
Scott: test the fuck out of it.

1042
01:08:08,351 --> 01:08:11,839
Rym: so yeah, that's how we review games and I cut.

1043
01:08:11,859 --> 01:08:23,374
Rym: that's why part of our that idea of having our own private review con Really tickles my fancy because that could push our geek nudge reviews into yet a new era of reviewing Mm-hmm.

1044
01:08:23,394 --> 01:08:25,689
Scott: I mean it would get us episodes for at least half a year.

1045
01:08:25,877 --> 01:08:27,652
Rym: Oh, yeah Plus obviously, you know We do is.

1046
01:08:28,135 --> 01:08:31,050
Rym: we'd also like just record the audio of the entire time.

1047
01:08:31,090 --> 01:08:33,260
Rym: We're playing the game live stream the entire time.

1048
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:33,863
Scott: We're playing the game.

1049
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:34,446
Rym: I could be fun.

1050
01:08:34,566 --> 01:08:34,747
Rym: Yeah.

1051
01:08:34,948 --> 01:08:39,406
Rym: Yeah Yeah, so we'll see that might be the the other con that we run the tiny one.

1052
01:08:39,567 --> 01:08:40,129
Rym: That's just us.

1053
01:08:41,430 --> 01:08:42,596
Scott: Anyway, that's it's not a con.

1054
01:08:42,778 --> 01:08:43,542
Rym: It's it could be a con.

1055
01:08:44,045 --> 01:08:44,648
Rym: It's our writers.
