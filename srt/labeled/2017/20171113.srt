00:00:12,586 --> 00:00:15,113
Rym: I am Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:20,548
Rym: We're talking about the IME Vulnerability that you probably don't know about.

5
00:00:20,569 --> 00:00:21,792
Rym: that definitely affects your PC.

6
00:00:21,832 --> 00:00:23,898
Scott: Can we just talk about IME in general?

7
00:00:24,158 --> 00:00:26,924
Scott: Yeah, probably Let's do this.

8
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:34,900
Rym: I guess the problem is it's kind of a complex Thing to talk about because a lot of people don't even know it exists.

9
00:00:36,086 --> 00:00:38,960
Scott: I was just talking about what it is and not worry too much about this specific.

10
00:00:39,181 --> 00:00:40,690
Rym: Well, I guess we'll talk about what it is and why.

11
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,399
Rym: it's why you should know what it is.

12
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,990
Scott: Let's go on to the other parts of the show first.

13
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:47,440
Scott: All right, so main bit does not come first.

14
00:00:47,722 --> 00:00:48,386
Rym: So I ran.

15
00:00:48,406 --> 00:00:56,260
Rym: Emily and I. we ran a race yesterday But it wasn't our usual like 5k running races that we run with the normal like NYC runner type thing.

16
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:57,663
Rym: Longer shorter.

17
00:00:58,005 --> 00:00:59,872
Rym: I was the same 5k cuz that's the like.

18
00:01:00,013 --> 00:01:01,660
Rym: that's the default race for most people.

19
00:01:02,202 --> 00:01:02,845
Rym: But we ran it.

20
00:01:03,368 --> 00:01:05,860
Rym: it was like a Rangers thing, oh you actually did that thing.

21
00:01:05,945 --> 00:01:10,339
Scott: Yeah Oh, I didn't realize it was yesterday because they kept advertising it so much during every game.

22
00:01:11,022 --> 00:01:13,833
Scott: And I think I said one time like oh, I guess you could do that.

23
00:01:13,853 --> 00:01:16,524
Rym: Yeah, and we told you actually did it All right, we can?

24
00:01:16,584 --> 00:01:19,620
Scott: I kept saying like are you faster than lunguist?

25
00:01:20,702 --> 00:01:23,757
Rym: So a few of booze booze Nevis actually came.

26
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:29,720
Rym: boo Nevis Yeah, and a whole bunch of retired Rangers like yeah famous ones the people who are playing did not come.

27
00:01:29,861 --> 00:01:31,553
Scott: Yeah, I get they could have used some exercise.

28
00:01:31,573 --> 00:01:32,600
Scott: then I'm gonna play until Wednesday.

29
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,365
Scott: Why don't they show up?

30
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:35,198
Rym: cuz they're asking boo about VCs teeth?

31
00:01:36,248 --> 00:01:38,448
Rym: They gone Do forgot one of them.

32
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:39,717
Rym: they found one in his live.

33
00:01:39,918 --> 00:01:43,893
Rym: Yep Like he spat and only one came out and they're like, where's the other one?

34
00:01:43,973 --> 00:01:45,680
Rym: and it was in anyway, that's all gross.

35
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,808
Rym: but yeah, so we ran the race.

36
00:01:47,848 --> 00:02:05,323
Rym: it was actually super fun and uh When the Rangers are involved as opposed to just like the running clubs There's a lot more hullabaloo around it because there's a lot more money involved Say but it was actually a pretty good race and I came in 15th overall.

37
00:02:05,805 --> 00:02:09,035
Rym: Okay out of like a thousand people actually who was in first place?

38
00:02:09,074 --> 00:02:09,597
Scott: boo Nevis.

39
00:02:09,798 --> 00:02:13,854
Rym: Yeah None of the Rangers people were in like anywhere near the front runners.

40
00:02:14,255 --> 00:02:15,299
Rym: They all started at the front.

41
00:02:15,681 --> 00:02:24,396
Scott: But I mean, you know boo Nevis is like, you know, he doesn't only play in the AHL He's on the New York Rangers a professional athlete getting paid plenty of money.

42
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:25,460
Scott: How come he's not faster than you?

43
00:02:25,864 --> 00:02:27,060
Rym: I don't know if he actually ran you.

44
00:02:27,803 --> 00:02:30,835
Rym: Okay, but a bunch of other people ran and they did not finish at the top.

45
00:02:31,197 --> 00:02:33,185
Rym: Well, they're old So I ran.

46
00:02:33,225 --> 00:02:36,559
Rym: my time was like 21 13, which is pretty good for someone my age.

47
00:02:37,062 --> 00:02:38,330
Rym: What's fascinating to me?

48
00:02:38,672 --> 00:02:41,745
Rym: Is that I was I think 15th overall.

49
00:02:41,765 --> 00:02:50,315
Rym: I was 14th overall in Men because the woman like the fastest woman actually was faster than me.

50
00:02:50,355 --> 00:02:51,579
Rym: She got a really good time.

51
00:02:52,282 --> 00:02:54,230
Scott: I saw she's an athlete of some game.

52
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,093
Rym: She looked at.

53
00:02:55,194 --> 00:03:02,516
Rym: she finished like right ahead of me and She ran at a steady pace like the entire time and I could not catch up to her despite.

54
00:03:02,536 --> 00:03:03,018
Rym: She's probably

55
00:03:03,038 --> 00:03:06,066
Scott: looking at you like this woman passed me

56
00:03:06,428 --> 00:03:21,720
Rym: but they posted video and I can see I actually like sprinted and passed a whole bunch of people right at the end, but I was like eighth in my age group and All the people who ran faster than me ran way faster than me in my age group meaning I could do better.

57
00:03:21,841 --> 00:03:23,269
Rym: It's not just old man Rym.

58
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:28,195
Scott: It's Rym needs to train harder Or you're not a professional athlete and they are.

59
00:03:28,215 --> 00:03:29,711
Rym: uh, no I think they all.

60
00:03:29,732 --> 00:03:34,402
Rym: it's kind of like, you know Those people we know who biking is their primary hobby as opposed to one of many hobbies Like.

61
00:03:34,786 --> 00:03:36,360
Rym: they only have one hobby and it's biking.

62
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,170
Scott: Listen DNA only gets you so far.

63
00:03:39,271 --> 00:03:40,960
Scott: You might not be able to be any fast.

64
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:45,720
Rym: I'm pretty happy that I can run like 14 15th overall in a moderately big race.

65
00:03:45,941 --> 00:03:47,048
Scott: How many people are in the race?

66
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:48,699
Rym: like eight or nine hundred thousand?

67
00:03:49,182 --> 00:03:51,613
Scott: Mmm, did they charge you money to be in the race for their charity or what?

68
00:03:51,654 --> 00:03:53,000
Rym: Yeah, but all the money went to charity.

69
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,582
Rym: So it was.

70
00:03:53,723 --> 00:03:54,647
Rym: it was garden of dreams.

71
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:55,872
Rym: Yeah, it's like health care thing.

72
00:03:55,912 --> 00:03:56,414
Rym: They split it 50/50.

73
00:03:56,414 --> 00:03:56,595
Rym: Mm-hmm.

74
00:03:57,961 --> 00:03:59,389
Rym: Garden of dreams actually does good stuff.

75
00:03:59,691 --> 00:04:00,194
Scott: It's okay.

76
00:04:00,335 --> 00:04:01,140
Scott: Yeah, you could do worse.

77
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:01,945
Scott: You could also do better.

78
00:04:01,965 --> 00:04:03,655
Rym: you could do a lot worse than garden of dreams.

79
00:04:03,675 --> 00:04:06,555
Scott: Yeah Better - you could do a lot better.

80
00:04:06,575 --> 00:04:06,716
Scott: Yeah.

81
00:04:07,903 --> 00:04:09,458
Rym: So yeah got some tech news.

82
00:04:10,381 --> 00:04:15,422
Scott: Yeah, so, you know, I don't know about anyone else right but for many years now, you know I'm pretty.

83
00:04:15,442 --> 00:04:21,620
Scott: you know, I know a lot of people out there are like full Google full Amazon full Apple full Microsoft, right?

84
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,021
Scott: Whatever.

85
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:24,353
Scott: I sort of spread my bones out a lot.

86
00:04:24,373 --> 00:04:31,260
Rym: You do I am full Google though I am like a hundred percent double down on Google Google some Apple some Amazon some Microsoft.

87
00:04:31,361 --> 00:04:32,514
Scott: I use a little bit everything.

88
00:04:32,534 --> 00:04:34,925
Scott: Oh Whoever the best one is.

89
00:04:35,185 --> 00:04:45,870
Rym: so I did split because I was using Amazon's cloud storage like not that not the server-side stuff But I was using the Amazon like Backup like cloud.

90
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,540
Rym: like these are facing cloud backup.

91
00:04:47,841 --> 00:04:52,376
Rym: I'm gonna stop using it because they ruined it and now it is too expensive for what I do.

92
00:04:52,497 --> 00:04:59,274
Scott: Anyway, so But for many years, you know as a result of using things like Google inbox and such right?

93
00:04:59,314 --> 00:05:02,723
Scott: I've used the Chrome browser primarily Yeah But why?

94
00:05:02,784 --> 00:05:13,900
Rym: because I the reasons why I used to use I used to you'd be pretty hardcore Firefox and the reasons I switched to Chrome Mostly centered around the fact that I am so Google and Google works just better in Chrome.

95
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,632
Scott: Well, cuz I mean I was using Firefox when it was Phoenix.

96
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:24,720
Scott: Yeah, right when the style of the time You know, I'm a belt right and the reason I switched to Chrome in those days is simply that it was just faster, right?

97
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,867
Scott: It was a time period where Firefox, you know got.

98
00:05:27,947 --> 00:05:38,340
Scott: originally Mozilla was this one program that had web browsing email Composer and those groups all in one app and it was slow as balls.

99
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:42,957
Scott: they made Firefox which is just the web browsing part of Mozilla and then they removed all the crap from it.

100
00:05:43,158 --> 00:05:51,474
Rym: and a lot of people a lot of Neck beards fears were that if you took all that nonsense out of a mainstream browser No one would do any of that nonsense anymore.

101
00:05:51,515 --> 00:05:52,259
Rym: They were kind of right.

102
00:05:52,621 --> 00:05:55,532
Scott: Well, I mean for composer to make web pages not necessary.

103
00:05:55,612 --> 00:06:00,055
Rym: Yeah, right and BBS is like, I'm sorry I know you but that tech is dead.

104
00:06:00,075 --> 00:06:00,780
Scott: It was dead.

105
00:06:01,081 --> 00:06:02,044
Scott: Didn't use it when I had it.

106
00:06:02,225 --> 00:06:04,713
Scott: message boards were dead and then Thunderbird.

107
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:05,636
Scott: people stop using that.

108
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,401
Scott: cuz never uses webmail or something Right.

109
00:06:07,502 --> 00:06:12,160
Rym: Yeah, I'm amazed when I run into someone who has a heart an email client.

110
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,510
Scott: That's like using pop except for except for Outlook and Exchange.

111
00:06:15,651 --> 00:06:17,657
Scott: Yeah, you know, anyone has an email client.

112
00:06:17,898 --> 00:06:20,809
Rym: Yep Like using Outlook like.

113
00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:23,079
Rym: that's a marginal use case at best anyway.

114
00:06:24,941 --> 00:06:27,710
Scott: So for many years, it's like I'm my computer at work.

115
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:33,960
Scott: For example, I have Chrome for my normal personal stuff And then I'll do my work in Firefox just to have a separate browser.

116
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,220
Rym: I know the same thing at work.

117
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:43,960
Scott: I know that you can actually open Chrome and have like two different chromes that have two different profiles But in practice that the user interface of that didn't work so well.

118
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,640
Scott: I'm like I would click on links and they'd open up in the wrong Chrome.

119
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,545
Scott: Yeah, because Chrome is your default browser But it doesn't know that.

120
00:06:49,585 --> 00:06:55,578
Scott: like aha when I click on a link in an email and outlook I want it to open in these in the chrome with this profile when I click on a link.

121
00:06:56,042 --> 00:06:58,140
Rym: Also a big part of that was in my previous job.

122
00:06:58,261 --> 00:07:09,747
Rym: I was basically the social media like marketing manager so I'd be tweeting and like doing social media stuff on behalf of the company and I wanted an Extra layer of Rym.

123
00:07:09,787 --> 00:07:10,469
Rym: It's Firefox.

124
00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:13,600
Rym: Don't tweet that like skeleton shit from that account.

125
00:07:13,821 --> 00:07:24,078
Scott: Yeah, anyway, so I just use Firefox for work and plus, you know at work, you know I don't want to use the ad block because we have ads on our site at work that I gotta see.

126
00:07:24,098 --> 00:07:28,440
Scott: Yeah But I don't want to browse anything at all without an ad block ever.

127
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,486
Scott: So I only use it to visit our own sites.

128
00:07:30,687 --> 00:07:33,154
Rym: also be wary because I add blockers.

129
00:07:33,174 --> 00:07:39,900
Rym: depending on how you do it have Access to data because they're an application that's actually inspecting content.

130
00:07:40,362 --> 00:07:43,836
Rym: So it ad blockers in a way will sidestep SSL TLS.

131
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,833
Rym: So instead, okay, they can they see the content.

132
00:07:48,516 --> 00:07:57,612
Rym: be wary of that I digress but if you're doing stuff for work, like you work at a real company Don't just run ad block without knowing what it's doing.

133
00:07:58,134 --> 00:08:02,109
Rym: if you're accessing corporate stuff with it Oh, yeah, just saying but I mean corporate stuff.

134
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,820
Scott: You don't need to block ads on exactly.

135
00:08:04,981 --> 00:08:14,332
Rym: so that's why again, I use Firefox for work stuff and I use Chrome for like right life, but What's happening right now is Firefox finally, right?

136
00:08:14,352 --> 00:08:16,800
Scott: They've done this many times where they're like, oh we got a new update.

137
00:08:16,921 --> 00:08:18,275
Scott: It's actually faster and better.

138
00:08:18,295 --> 00:08:18,760
Scott: I got new update.

139
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:22,556
Scott: It's actually faster and better but no for reals this time like not even joking.

140
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:25,090
Scott: actually for reals Not boy who cried wolf.

141
00:08:25,432 --> 00:08:26,700
Scott: There is a version of Firefox.

142
00:08:26,941 --> 00:08:28,588
Scott: It was it was it's set in stone.

143
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:35,490
Scott: you can get it right now as of this podcast on Monday night, but it's called what quantum it officially releases tomorrow.

144
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:36,352
Scott: It's Firefox 57.

145
00:08:36,352 --> 00:08:37,134
Scott: I tried it out.

146
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:41,246
Scott: It is Faster than Chrome no question.

147
00:08:41,347 --> 00:08:42,792
Scott: I'm on two Windows computers.

148
00:08:42,812 --> 00:08:44,418
Scott: that and a Mac and a Windows computer.

149
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:54,572
Rym: that I tried You is because quote the faster web browser in quotes in the modern era has meant as much to me as people who like Worry about the cast latency on their RAM.

150
00:08:54,632 --> 00:08:55,095
Scott: No, no, no.

151
00:08:55,115 --> 00:08:58,149
Scott: No, this is like Faster in terms of benchmarks.

152
00:08:58,249 --> 00:09:00,180
Scott: I can't say what I can say.

153
00:09:00,321 --> 00:09:03,600
Scott: Is that like without any sort of benchmark tool whatsoever?

154
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:11,362
Scott: You type URL into this site you push enter it appears you go to Safari or Chrome or whatever and there is a note You can.

155
00:09:11,382 --> 00:09:21,660
Scott: there's the visual noticeable delay in rendering Right and also the responsiveness of the page while scrolling up and down moving about clicking to go to the next page, right?

156
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,180
Scott: It feels like you just got a new computer with a fresh install when you use this Firefox.

157
00:09:25,663 --> 00:09:28,680
Scott: So at least that is my experience on two completely different computers.

158
00:09:29,282 --> 00:09:35,280
Rym: So it does lose the Google Direct integration stuff that Chrome has which is a big part of how I use Chrome.

159
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,915
Scott: Yeah, you lose the Chrome sync big deal.

160
00:09:37,935 --> 00:09:39,426
Scott: this Firefox sync It does the same thing.

161
00:09:39,608 --> 00:09:48,192
Rym: part of it too is that I use the notifications but also I use a hardware token for my two-factor and That only works with Chrome right now.

162
00:09:48,252 --> 00:09:48,513
Scott: Nothing.

163
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:49,660
Scott: I do only works with Chrome.

164
00:09:52,124 --> 00:10:01,360
Scott: The only feature that I would lose by going to Firefox is that Chrome has a feature where you can be looking at a web page on Chrome on say your computer.

165
00:10:02,081 --> 00:10:09,219
Scott: Open up Chrome on your mobile device and then be like show me my links that are currently open in tabs on my computer And then click on one to open it.

166
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,520
Rym: That is a good feature too that I imagine I will also lose if I go to this Firefox.

167
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,319
Scott: You didn't even know about the feature and you've never used it.

168
00:10:15,862 --> 00:10:24,454
Rym: Actually, I've been poking around with remember how Windows Phone used to have features been around for years By the way, have a thing that integrates with Windows.

169
00:10:24,534 --> 00:10:30,365
Rym: like you can say hey Windows There's my Windows Phone and do like a lot of that kind of stuff Because Windows Phone is dead.

170
00:10:30,425 --> 00:10:31,650
Rym: You can just do that with Android now.

171
00:10:31,952 --> 00:10:32,172
Rym: Yeah.

172
00:10:32,554 --> 00:10:35,860
Rym: Anyway, and it kinds kind of cool I've been playing with it anyway.

173
00:10:37,561 --> 00:10:39,468
Scott: Yeah, there's nothing that I use like.

174
00:10:39,528 --> 00:10:43,060
Scott: I even stopped using Chrome because Chrome on iOS is just worse than Safari.

175
00:10:44,551 --> 00:10:50,720
Scott: So I just get even though I was losing that one feature that I used occasionally Safari on iOS just so much better.

176
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:56,940
Scott: I only have Chrome installed on iOS because for some reason Jackbox only works in Chrome on a not Safari.

177
00:10:58,981 --> 00:11:01,147
Rym: So I got some stats from this article.

178
00:11:01,207 --> 00:11:05,220
Rym: right now Chrome is 60% of desktop browser usage.

179
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:16,120
Rym: if you told Rym and Scott when we were in college that any non Microsoft browser would be that percentage I would not believe you because the world has changed a lot.

180
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,357
Scott: Well, no, I mean I. when Chrome came out and Firefox came out and was called Phoenix.

181
00:11:20,377 --> 00:11:21,140
Scott: I started using it.

182
00:11:21,241 --> 00:11:23,463
Scott: I know that that was the shit I don't.

183
00:11:23,543 --> 00:11:24,025
Scott: I didn't know.

184
00:11:24,045 --> 00:11:27,760
Scott: I did know - but I didn't know at the time if we'd get non nerds to use it.

185
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,788
Rym: But that was what I'd expect.

186
00:11:29,908 --> 00:11:32,880
Rym: I thought that cool is definitely catching on big time.

187
00:11:32,981 --> 00:11:42,540
Rym: I always thought that corporations would never let people use non Microsoft browser and then the revolution happened and pretty much most companies force you to use Chrome or Firefox.

188
00:11:43,341 --> 00:11:45,610
Scott: In fact, there was a time is a funny story.

189
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:49,251
Scott: The RIT library had a little stage in it at one point I don't know if it's still there.

190
00:11:49,272 --> 00:11:55,460
Scott: Oh And you could sign up to do talks there and I was like so I figured out how to sign up but I signed up.

191
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:02,419
Scott: I'm like, ah, I know I'll go in there and I'll do a presentation about Phoenix and get people to use it because people don't fucking know and they this is RIT.

192
00:12:02,641 --> 00:12:03,465
Scott: They definitely want to know.

193
00:12:03,505 --> 00:12:04,249
Scott: and yep, right.

194
00:12:04,751 --> 00:12:08,799
Scott: and then so I sign up and I'm like, yeah I need a projector with a VGA cable so I can you know.

195
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,456
Scott: Demo this shit and a laptop because I didn't have one at the time.

196
00:12:11,476 --> 00:12:15,560
Rym: Yeah You could check laptops out from the library, right?

197
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:20,317
Scott: So I show up and the projector is not there and I went to the library desk.

198
00:12:20,337 --> 00:12:21,120
Scott: I'm like, where is it?

199
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:28,043
Scott: They're like, we don't know Mm-hmm, and then I looked around and there's all these people studying and it would be super awkward to suddenly do a presentation to people Studying.

200
00:12:28,063 --> 00:12:32,285
Scott: I thought they would like set up chairs facing the stages Schedule.

201
00:12:32,306 --> 00:12:34,177
Scott: so I just left and no one said anything.

202
00:12:34,217 --> 00:12:34,600
Scott: I never heard.

203
00:12:35,412 --> 00:12:41,403
Rym: I mean the only Alternative is to do what I did at that anime con long ago when one person showed up to my panel is just loudly start Doing the panel.

204
00:12:42,145 --> 00:12:46,140
Scott: I mean, I I would have been fine doing that but I couldn't demo Phoenix without.

205
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,666
Scott: I Needed those necessary equipment.

206
00:12:50,727 --> 00:12:51,790
Scott: I couldn't just do it by talking.

207
00:12:52,292 --> 00:12:53,877
Rym: So the article was what's interesting.

208
00:12:53,917 --> 00:13:01,435
Rym: the other statistic Let's see quote if you're already a Firefox user You should receive an automatic upgrade when it launches November 14th.

209
00:13:01,476 --> 00:13:04,768
Rym: So tomorrow tomorrow Chances are you're not a user.

210
00:13:04,788 --> 00:13:07,960
Rym: Yep, 13% of desktop users using Firefox.

211
00:13:08,382 --> 00:13:16,860
Scott: Well, I hope just try it out if you know if you're one of those people who left Firefox or you know Maybe you're concerned, you know concerned about like privacy and stuff like that.

212
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:22,967
Scott: Listen, Firefox is no no skin in any games where Google Microsoft Yeah, Apple all do.

213
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:30,940
Scott: Apple is really good on privacy though You know, they're at Google's not trying to make Google's making money off eyeballs Mozilla's making money off nothing.

214
00:13:31,282 --> 00:13:38,899
Scott: Yep, one thing though if you clean install Firefox Go to the settings and make sure you change your default search engine from Yahoo to Google.

215
00:13:42,546 --> 00:13:46,706
Rym: Yeah You know though it's.

216
00:13:47,591 --> 00:13:54,097
Rym: I'm just glad this is happening because Whenever one of anything starts to run away with the game.

217
00:13:54,157 --> 00:13:58,317
Rym: It's always dangerous And I'm glad that there is competition again here.

218
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:04,900
Scott: Yes, I think I'm gonna switch away from you know, make Firefox my personal browser and then use Chrome for the work browser.

219
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:08,140
Rym: I'm gonna hold off again because I use hardware two-factor.

220
00:14:08,522 --> 00:14:11,093
Rym: Oh, yeah, and I can't like I don't have to like.

221
00:14:11,134 --> 00:14:12,520
Rym: I can use the Google off app.

222
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:17,511
Rym: I actually have two different ways to do two-factor But I prefer to use my hardware token and that does that.

223
00:14:17,592 --> 00:14:19,699
Rym: don't think that'll work with the new Firefox anytime soon.

224
00:14:20,783 --> 00:14:26,977
Rym: So in other news, this isn't purely tech But it's an interesting thing that you that you should bear in mind because we've talked about this a lot.

225
00:14:27,459 --> 00:14:30,480
Rym: but Advertising, you know, we just mentioned adblock.

226
00:14:31,461 --> 00:14:37,717
Rym: The biggest danger with the fact that we're all moving to these models like Netflix where people pay for ad free content.

227
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:38,739
Rym: Is that?

228
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:52,700
Rym: Advertisers are desperate to do anything to advertise to someone who they know has enough money to pay not to see ads We've talked about this before where it's like, aha the people are buying ads for and it's free content.

229
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,070
Scott: But that means the people watching don't have any fucking money.

230
00:14:55,472 --> 00:14:57,260
Scott: You're paying to make ads go away.

231
00:14:57,702 --> 00:14:59,430
Scott: Oh, those are people who have money.

232
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,520
Scott: We really want to show ads to them.

233
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:03,399
Scott: They have enough money to make ads go away.

234
00:15:03,681 --> 00:15:05,328
Scott: That means they have money to spend on stuff.

235
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,760
Scott: if we advertise to them we can get some of that money.

236
00:15:08,102 --> 00:15:10,600
Scott: Yep, and now this is when you're a company like Netflix.

237
00:15:10,703 --> 00:15:21,760
Scott: It's like uh These advertisers will pay even more money for us to show these ads to the people who are paying to make the ads go Away, what do charge more money to the people who are paying to make ads go away show.

238
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:30,379
Scott: Yeah, that's why you know Hulu there is still like a few shows that like, you know I don't watch any of those garbage shows, but you still see ads even if you pay to make ads go away.

239
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:41,950
Rym: so the needle shifting again toward the advertisers because Amazon is apparently developing a Free ad Supported compliment to Prime streaming video.

240
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:42,692
Scott: Well, that's not.

241
00:15:42,753 --> 00:15:45,847
Scott: that's not them paying to show ads They're not who are paying for prime.

242
00:15:45,868 --> 00:15:48,686
Rym: They're not putting ads in the stuff You're already paying for though.

243
00:15:48,707 --> 00:15:50,439
Rym: Apparently they have done that a few times.

244
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:57,720
Scott: No This is if you don't even have Amazon Prime you can watch Amazon Prime streaming video with ads on it for free.

245
00:15:57,981 --> 00:15:58,805
Scott: That's all this is.

246
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:02,320
Scott: So apparently I didn't notice the opposite of what Hulu did Hulu's like.

247
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:06,139
Scott: Well, if you want to see any Hulu's now, you got to have an account and pay Amazon Prime's like.

248
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:06,816
Scott: oh well You know what?

249
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:11,430
Scott: Now you can watch Amazon Prime video, even if you don't have Amazon Prime.

250
00:16:11,691 --> 00:16:13,616
Rym: So apparently Amazon has that.

251
00:16:13,697 --> 00:16:21,638
Rym: I'm gonna quote this here Amazon put ads inside NFL games that people were seeing on Prime.

252
00:16:21,658 --> 00:16:22,019
Rym: Mm-hmm.

253
00:16:23,203 --> 00:16:25,479
Scott: So I have twitch prime which gets rid of all ads.

254
00:16:26,122 --> 00:16:28,529
Scott: I was watching the rocket league world championships yesterday.

255
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,315
Rym: the rocket league people put their own ad in.

256
00:16:30,415 --> 00:16:33,742
Scott: there were ads as part of the stream on Twitch.

257
00:16:33,842 --> 00:16:34,465
Scott: that we're not.

258
00:16:34,686 --> 00:16:36,373
Scott: they were not of twitch ads using.

259
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:38,000
Rym: so that's one important thing.

260
00:16:38,462 --> 00:16:40,249
Rym: It was not allowed to fucking do that.

261
00:16:40,269 --> 00:16:42,218
Scott: The event was sponsored by twitch.

262
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:45,232
Scott: yet I'm pretty sure that's against the twitch terms of sir.

263
00:16:45,292 --> 00:16:49,833
Scott: Yeah, you're not allowed to do that on Google I know which doesn't get a cut of those ads, you know, they're.

264
00:16:49,893 --> 00:16:51,380
Scott: they're sponsoring this event.

265
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:55,859
Scott: I wonder what was up with that, but I was pissed when I saw an ad that I could not get rid of.

266
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,706
Rym: Yep, and the danger here.

267
00:16:57,726 --> 00:17:11,159
Rym: The reason I bring this up is that any time a Company starts to edge back into the free supported by ads model That is what is on the verge of really fucking up the games industry right now.

268
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,708
Rym: Regarding these free-to-play games and their loot boxes.

269
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:17,079
Scott: if that becomes that's a gambling issue not an ad issue.

270
00:17:17,165 --> 00:17:17,232
Rym: No.

271
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:26,791
Rym: but if there is a model that is the shitty model and a company realizes that Way more people are willing to go the shitty way than the good way.

272
00:17:27,314 --> 00:17:29,180
Rym: They'll if they'll edge that way.

273
00:17:30,102 --> 00:17:38,203
Rym: So if Amazon decided that they can make more money by having only ad versions as opposed to paid versions They would do it.

274
00:17:38,805 --> 00:17:39,868
Rym: all these companies would.

275
00:17:40,329 --> 00:17:45,790
Rym: so right now Netflix seems to be the only hardline company and We'll see how this all goes.

276
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:57,550
Rym: It doesn't matter cuz yeah But anyway things of the day.

277
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:02,413
Rym: so I want to point out Scott came to me and he said and I quote My thing of the day is only a picture.

278
00:18:02,433 --> 00:18:09,284
Rym: Yep now I have done similar things in the past and all I could say to Scott was imagine if the Situations are reversed.

279
00:18:09,706 --> 00:18:10,167
Rym: and yeah, hi.

280
00:18:10,228 --> 00:18:12,134
Rym: and you and I said these words to you.

281
00:18:12,576 --> 00:18:13,720
Rym: What would your reaction be?

282
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,654
Scott: I would say Rym what kind of thing a day is just a picture?

283
00:18:16,714 --> 00:18:17,860
Scott: your thing a day is probably crap.

284
00:18:18,262 --> 00:18:19,710
Scott: My thing a day is gonna be way better.

285
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:23,549
Scott: Yeah, and here we have a case though Where the picture that is my thing of the day.

286
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,116
Scott: It's actually a tweet with a picture in it.

287
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:28,290
Rym: Yeah My thing of the day is this tweet.

288
00:18:28,572 --> 00:18:35,099
Scott: Yeah, and I go Rym I gotta think of this just a tweet basically really just the picture in the tweet.

289
00:18:35,521 --> 00:18:44,937
Scott: But I care I'll bet money that not only is it better than anything in the day that you'll come up with But it is also that you will admit it is better than anything in the day that you come up with.

290
00:18:44,977 --> 00:18:50,154
Scott: This is so good But yeah, it's someone's Halloween costume from the nation of Japan.

291
00:18:50,576 --> 00:18:51,722
Scott: They are cosplaying as Dad.

292
00:18:55,901 --> 00:19:10,691
Rym: It's so usually there's the situation in cosplay where sometimes someone has a really clever idea and they execute it the minimum Possible way to make the joke and the opposite side is the amazing costume that's very well put together But it's a thing that I don't know about.

293
00:19:10,751 --> 00:19:16,274
Rym: like it or it's not a joke Yeah, or it's like just it's a beautifully done character from a game.

294
00:19:16,314 --> 00:19:16,796
Rym: I don't know.

295
00:19:16,816 --> 00:19:24,280
Rym: Mm-hmm great This is both well executed and high concept, this is a very high concept.

296
00:19:24,582 --> 00:19:30,586
Scott: It gives me some inspiration for costumes of my own that I will not do Talk about doing and not actually do.

297
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:41,320
Rym: Chris typed death in the stream because that's what we're talking about And Google flagged it as possibly offensive and I had to manually approve the death threat the word death.

298
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,591
Rym: Yeah, I should report him for making death threats.

299
00:19:43,631 --> 00:19:44,535
Rym: get him banned from Google.

300
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,919
Rym: I Should write.

301
00:19:49,562 --> 00:19:53,716
Rym: So my thing today is just this music video that I stumbled upon called a float.

302
00:19:53,856 --> 00:19:54,880
Scott: is it better than my thing a day?

303
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:57,370
Rym: I think it's equal but different.

304
00:19:58,013 --> 00:19:59,097
Rym: Oh, look at this owls guys.

305
00:19:59,137 --> 00:19:59,840
Rym: It's a good owl, right?

306
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,403
Scott: That's a good owl.

307
00:20:00,524 --> 00:20:01,691
Rym: That's that is the kind of.

308
00:20:01,711 --> 00:20:03,060
Scott: why is the owl also a lighter?

309
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:08,800
Rym: The owl is not only also a lighter but it's also a day like laser spewing death machine.

310
00:20:09,621 --> 00:20:11,629
Rym: The owl basically saves the day in every situation.

311
00:20:11,649 --> 00:20:12,532
Rym: This is music video.

312
00:20:12,572 --> 00:20:13,516
Scott: I like cute owls though.

313
00:20:13,716 --> 00:20:14,640
Rym: Yeah, this owl is cute.

314
00:20:15,021 --> 00:20:15,643
Rym: He spins his head.

315
00:20:15,684 --> 00:20:30,177
Rym: He pops up all the time and it is just this music video about space pirates and pulp sci-fi animated nonsense and the music video is just really good and the song is really good and I think you should just watch this.

316
00:20:31,403 --> 00:20:32,414
Rym: That's all I got to say about it.

317
00:20:33,621 --> 00:20:39,680
Rym: Anyway in the meta moment the book club book was the fifth season by NK jemisin and I have now read the entire trilogy.

318
00:20:39,882 --> 00:20:51,839
Rym: So if that was fast, uh All I want to say is that I have posted some thoughts the the end of the thread in the book club in the in The GeekNights forum, which you should join because the GeekNights forum is pretty fucking baller.

319
00:20:52,401 --> 00:20:53,305
Rym: But you just join it.

320
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:55,452
Rym: use a link to it on our website.

321
00:20:55,512 --> 00:20:57,419
Rym: It's great, but we're talking about the book and

322
00:20:58,442 --> 00:21:00,589
Scott: Our website is front row crew calm by the way Yeah

323
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,113
Rym: And community dot front row crew calm is our new forum which is pretty warm

324
00:21:04,133 --> 00:21:09,460
Scott: dot front row crew calm is the old forum which Is locked in read-only mode for eternity and is slightly broken but still readable.

325
00:21:09,641 --> 00:21:20,280
Rym: Yep, forever, but in the bottom of the thread about the fifth season We're starting to talk about the full trilogy a little bit edging into spoilers, but without spoiling it spoiling anything at all.

326
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:31,416
Rym: I will say that people who have I can see why some people were not satisfied With the second and third books in terms of what the mysteries actually were and what some of the answers were.

327
00:21:31,436 --> 00:21:35,402
Rym: I am Satisfied.

328
00:21:35,984 --> 00:21:41,820
Rym: I am really happy with knowing what the deal is with the Guardians knowing what the deal is with the evil earth.

329
00:21:41,981 --> 00:21:44,680
Scott: Well, it's good to know that I'm gonna get know what the deal is.

330
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:47,040
Scott: It's not some secret of space that will never be revealed.

331
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,980
Rym: There are some things you don't learn the full deal, but it's totally fine.

332
00:21:51,141 --> 00:21:52,892
Scott: This is not the cool things like snake people.

333
00:21:53,274 --> 00:21:56,188
Rym: now seriously I like all the things you care about.

334
00:21:56,289 --> 00:22:07,122
Rym: I guarantee our answer to your satisfaction and The direction those answers go are a little bit ghost in the shell mmm and a lot Evangelion.

335
00:22:07,182 --> 00:22:08,045
Scott: well, those are two things.

336
00:22:08,105 --> 00:22:09,008
Scott: I like yep.

337
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:12,360
Rym: I am so 100% happy with the way this trilogy ended.

338
00:22:12,822 --> 00:22:14,350
Rym: I have nothing but positive things to say.

339
00:22:14,652 --> 00:22:15,597
Rym: if you like the first book.

340
00:22:15,859 --> 00:22:17,386
Rym: in the evening I spoke plug cookbook club.

341
00:22:17,728 --> 00:22:19,436
Rym: You should just read the rest of the books.

342
00:22:19,476 --> 00:22:23,383
Rym: They're great and I'm gonna pick the new book soon I'm gonna.

343
00:22:23,423 --> 00:22:23,824
Rym: I got.

344
00:22:23,885 --> 00:22:28,160
Rym: I'm really really tempted to pick that new translation of the Odyssey.

345
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:29,183
Scott: How long is?

346
00:22:30,046 --> 00:22:32,012
Rym: uh, you know exactly how long the Odyssey is.

347
00:22:32,073 --> 00:22:32,755
Rym: It's the Odyssey.

348
00:22:32,795 --> 00:22:33,537
Rym: We've both ready.

349
00:22:33,939 --> 00:22:34,340
Scott: What's that?

350
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:34,986
Scott: What's the new?

351
00:22:35,027 --> 00:22:35,532
Scott: why is it?

352
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:39,631
Scott: The translated newly any different than an older translation.

353
00:22:39,712 --> 00:22:41,096
Rym: When was the last time you read the Odyssey?

354
00:22:41,297 --> 00:22:41,959
Scott: the pop-up book?

355
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:49,600
Rym: Okay, so I've been hankering to read the Odyssey again for like a decade now, and I just haven't okay home.

356
00:22:50,002 --> 00:22:52,999
Rym: But there is apparently this new translation of the Odyssey.

357
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,606
Scott: Why is it better in?

358
00:22:55,726 --> 00:22:58,936
Rym: it's better in the same way that or different.

359
00:22:59,256 --> 00:23:03,028
Rym: the newer penguin Translation of the Count of Monte Cristo was better.

360
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:16,055
Rym: It's more colloquial and modern and it takes appropriate liberties with the translation of specific words and themes To make it a more modern flowing reading while maintaining everything that's good about the Odyssey.

361
00:23:16,075 --> 00:23:17,700
Scott: two different ones if you choose that.

362
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,949
Scott: So we're not gonna be able to compare two different.

363
00:23:20,029 --> 00:23:23,944
Rym: I am also not going to reread the old translations I have may have read.

364
00:23:23,964 --> 00:23:25,830
Scott: I will compare it to the pop-up book though.

365
00:23:26,212 --> 00:23:28,460
Rym: Yeah, God that pop-up book is so good.

366
00:23:28,982 --> 00:23:30,571
Scott: I just saw it the other day cuz looking at my shelf.

367
00:23:31,134 --> 00:23:31,496
Rym: I can't.

368
00:23:31,797 --> 00:23:37,014
Rym: the Cyclops and the sphere that pops out is so good.

369
00:23:37,054 --> 00:23:37,697
Rym: That is a choice.

370
00:23:37,737 --> 00:23:38,520
Rym: pocket pop-up book.

371
00:23:39,221 --> 00:23:46,940
Rym: So I'm leaning heavily toward picking this new translation of the Odyssey to learn about the journey of this complicated man.

372
00:23:47,542 --> 00:23:48,627
Rym: But I could be swayed.

373
00:23:48,647 --> 00:23:50,233
Rym: I got some other books that I'm thinking about.

374
00:23:50,454 --> 00:23:53,000
Scott: it isn't a definite picker It's not a definite pick.

375
00:23:53,521 --> 00:23:55,045
Rym: So I am soliciting comments.

376
00:23:55,546 --> 00:23:59,516
Rym: do will you read the Odyssey if you have never read it?

377
00:23:59,696 --> 00:24:01,320
Rym: read it before if I pick this?

378
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:07,107
Rym: Good modern translation because if you've never read the Odyssey What's wrong with you?

379
00:24:07,147 --> 00:24:08,534
Rym: That's like required high school.

380
00:24:08,555 --> 00:24:09,540
Rym: How do you not know about?

381
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:13,465
Scott: Cyclopses and sirens and yeah No all that cool shit.

382
00:24:13,645 --> 00:24:17,639
Rym: and also the fact that Odysseus is kind of a shithead and kind of a jerk.

383
00:24:18,581 --> 00:24:19,463
Scott: Listen people like jerks.

384
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:22,572
Rym: Yeah, but he is like.

385
00:24:22,612 --> 00:24:25,580
Rym: he does good things, but he also does really shitty things.

386
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:30,760
Rym: He's kind of a shithead, and it's just most people who read it don't seem to get that out of it.

387
00:24:30,821 --> 00:24:36,680
Rym: And I if you've not read it I want to find out if you think Odysseus is as much of a shithead as I think he is all about bro side.

388
00:24:38,681 --> 00:24:50,349
Rym: Well yeah Poseidon is the biggest piece of shit, and I'll never say that out loud to his face cuz he'll fucking drown me Poseidon seriously like you're cool.

389
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:52,219
Rym: We're cool right like I'm just joking.

390
00:24:55,241 --> 00:24:56,585
Scott: Okay, so actual metamoments.

391
00:24:56,846 --> 00:24:59,353
Scott: this weekend is PAX unplugged.

392
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:01,780
Scott: it is a PAX that is exclusively tabletop.

Scott: You can read the schedule yourself.

395
00:25:05,481 --> 00:25:08,389
Scott: Yep, if you're not already going it might be too late.

396
00:25:08,449 --> 00:25:09,933
Scott: I don't know what Saturday is.

397
00:25:10,013 --> 00:25:12,340
Scott: so it's in Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.

412
00:25:49,663 --> 00:25:51,420
Scott: That's how it's gonna be we're gonna be at both.

413
00:25:51,661 --> 00:25:57,339
Rym: We are definitely doing panels at mag fest because like they're in and it's mages and almost guaranteed packs out.

414
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:57,660
Scott: panel.

415
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:01,480
Rym: Yeah, we're probably doing panels at pecs out, but I never say guarantee.

416
00:26:01,702 --> 00:26:03,576
Rym: Hey, cuz I do not have a contract tax.

417
00:26:03,798 --> 00:26:07,672
Scott: East 2018 badges just went on sale.

418
00:26:07,692 --> 00:26:09,399
Scott: I think Saturday is sold out.

419
00:26:10,122 --> 00:26:14,498
Scott: It's a four-day con though you could go like Thursday Friday Sunday, maybe I don't know.

421
00:26:18,416 --> 00:26:21,715

422
00:26:21,735 --> 00:26:21,856
Scott: well.

423
00:26:21,876 --> 00:26:22,480
Scott: You can get a hotel.

424
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,106
Scott: Just it will be far away.

425
00:26:24,206 --> 00:26:27,719
Scott: Yeah, that sucks, or I think a lot of people just driving instead.

426
00:26:27,739 --> 00:26:28,040
Scott: look at that.

427
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,406
Scott: It's like Thursday Friday Sunday.

428
00:26:29,446 --> 00:26:31,454
Scott: You can buy these easily not even sold out.

429
00:26:31,554 --> 00:26:32,819
Scott: Oh Saturday completely sold out.

430
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:35,839
Scott: Yeah, I guess a lot of people see PAX East as a one-day.

431
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:42,860
Scott: You know expo Hall experience, but if you are actually a packs person you can experience a whole lot of packs.

432
00:26:43,041 --> 00:26:43,944
Scott: You know the real way.

433
00:26:43,964 --> 00:26:47,600
Scott: and just you know buy a scalp Saturday badge from somebody yeah.

434
00:26:47,781 --> 00:26:49,472
Scott: Or skip Saturday and enjoy Boston.

435
00:26:49,492 --> 00:26:57,530
Scott: you still get three days of packs Which is as much packs as you would have gotten last year caveat, and you'll still see the beginning and the finale Saturday.

436
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:58,299
Scott: this is what are you missing?

437
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,563
Scott: Panels on Saturday.

438
00:26:59,583 --> 00:27:01,972
Rym: you're missing the crowded as day in the expo halls.

439
00:27:02,032 --> 00:27:09,332
Scott: what I hope our pattern panel is not Saturday But also well I hope it is gonna be the crowded as day X East is in April.

440
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:17,960
Rym: so the odds of it being a Ridiculous hottie and nightmare escape of bitter cold are slightly lower slightly slightly.

441
00:27:18,801 --> 00:27:25,291
Rym: It's Boston, but it means you might be able to go enjoy Boston because last year You would not have gone out and enjoyed Boston cold.

442
00:27:25,351 --> 00:27:27,239
Rym: You'd have hidden around a fire for the entire time.

443
00:27:28,222 --> 00:27:30,071
Rym: So yeah, let's talk about this Intel thing.

444
00:27:30,452 --> 00:27:35,780
Scott: okay a lot of ground to cover here Alright, so you got you got to explain so people can understand this right.

445
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:38,791
Scott: There's a thing that came into existence in the late 2000s.

446
00:27:38,871 --> 00:27:43,285
Scott: the people sorted knew about in theory But Intel kept it a secret.

447
00:27:43,666 --> 00:27:49,967
Rym: you see articles in like really deep nerd places saying hey There's this thing called IME.

448
00:27:49,987 --> 00:27:50,871
Rym: Do you know about it?

449
00:27:50,891 --> 00:27:52,760
Scott: mm-hmm, but basically nowadays?

450
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:59,320
Scott: In more recent times like the past you know a few months more beans keep getting spilled about it and the truth comes out.

451
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,586
Scott: Here's what it is the Intel management engine.

452
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:04,193
Scott: right and in theory right.

453
00:28:04,554 --> 00:28:06,620
Scott: it has a good intentioned existence.

454
00:28:06,842 --> 00:28:08,313
Scott: Right you have a computer.

455
00:28:08,454 --> 00:28:08,958
Scott: It's got a CPU.

456
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,008
Scott: That's really complicated right.

457
00:28:11,069 --> 00:28:16,990
Scott: and you got this operating system that nominally Manages the CPU and the scheduling of processes and everything else.

458
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:17,230
Scott: right.

459
00:28:17,551 --> 00:28:23,919
Scott: so the operating system handles all the CPU biz and everything else Is talking you know through the operating system and whatnot right?

460
00:28:25,464 --> 00:28:32,473
Scott: But there are some things That perhaps even the operating system shouldn't be trusted to manage right.

461
00:28:33,074 --> 00:28:35,160
Scott: so for example power management.

462
00:28:35,321 --> 00:28:45,340
Scott: Right operating systems aren't really always that good at putting the computer to sleep for example Yeah, or waking it up when the from on LAN, or you know these sorts of things right?

463
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:45,703
Rym: It's like.

464
00:28:45,723 --> 00:28:46,900
Rym: I'll give you an analogy.

465
00:28:47,021 --> 00:28:51,651
Rym: This is not relevant to CPUs But in hard drives a solid-state disk right.

466
00:28:52,193 --> 00:29:00,140
Rym: so when you put data on a solid-state disk You have this interface with the disk, but inside the disk it has its own hardware and software.

467
00:29:00,542 --> 00:29:03,279
Rym: That is managing where the bits actually go.

468
00:29:03,962 --> 00:29:21,135
Rym: Because one the OS and the users shouldn't don't need to know that you just need the data to be there and two if the OS was gonna manage that it might fuck it up because there's a lot of internal details that are complicated and The manufacturer of that hard disk knows better than you.

469
00:29:21,437 --> 00:29:23,645
Scott: yep So this Intel management engine?

470
00:29:23,945 --> 00:29:24,166
Scott: right.

471
00:29:24,447 --> 00:29:26,974
Scott: the truth that we have learned about it is now this right.

472
00:29:27,335 --> 00:29:29,120
Scott: so basically it is an operating system.

473
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,328
Scott: It's Minix right which is an OS.

474
00:29:31,489 --> 00:29:36,549
Scott: it is and is now because we have discovered that it is What the Intel management engine is based on.

475
00:29:36,569 --> 00:29:38,839
Scott: it is actually the most deployed?

476
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,164
Scott: operating system on earth.

477
00:29:41,284 --> 00:29:48,543
Scott: Minix is basically a super Intel chip since like 2008 or 9 has it whether you're running Windows OS X Whatever.

478
00:29:48,905 --> 00:29:51,738
Scott: you got that Intel management engine because everyone's using Intel CPUs.

479
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:55,800
Rym: now We're not gonna get too deep into the details of Minix because it has a story.

480
00:29:55,941 --> 00:30:01,620
Scott: It's an open-source Unix operating system that can be really small yes But the way that the way to put it Minix Min.

481
00:30:02,062 --> 00:30:05,380
Rym: It is not a light or stripped-down version of Linux.

482
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,907
Rym: You know its own thing.

483
00:30:07,028 --> 00:30:15,020
Scott: it is a POSIX Unix II operating system That is just really tiny and if you wonder what POSIX is that is out of scope for this podcast anyway.

484
00:30:16,868 --> 00:30:19,105
Scott: So How we're like?

485
00:30:19,125 --> 00:30:19,648
Scott: well wait a minute.

486
00:30:19,668 --> 00:30:20,412
Scott: I'm running Windows.

487
00:30:20,452 --> 00:30:21,860
Scott: how does this other operating system?

488
00:30:21,961 --> 00:30:22,423
Scott: How does this?

489
00:30:22,584 --> 00:30:23,771
Scott: how does this work right?

490
00:30:23,972 --> 00:30:25,280
Scott: how exactly does this function?

491
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:29,120
Scott: I'm trying to explain it to someone who doesn't know anything about how CPUs work.

492
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:35,417
Scott: So basically you know on your computer You could become root and you're allowed to do things that you're not allowed to do and you're not root.

493
00:30:35,478 --> 00:30:37,439
Scott: you got to type in Your administrator password or whatever.

494
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,527
Rym: Use some sudo right.

495
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:48,777
Scott: push the yes button when Windows says hey you want to be administrator right now It's like yes right up CPUs actually have that same kind of thing right?

496
00:30:48,797 --> 00:30:52,473
Scott: the x86 Architecture in particular has what are known as rings.

497
00:30:52,533 --> 00:30:52,634
Scott: now.

498
00:30:52,674 --> 00:30:56,772
Scott: originally back in the day There was just ring zero and like rings one two three.

499
00:30:56,812 --> 00:30:58,500
Scott: I don't think anyone uses one and two anymore.

500
00:30:58,883 --> 00:31:00,680
Scott: I think it's pretty much three zero.

501
00:31:01,122 --> 00:31:06,860
Scott: And then they added all these negative ones like negative one negative two negative three right yep And for what it's worth as an IT major?

502
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:09,750
Rym: Well, I like I never really did assembly programming in RIT.

503
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,596
Rym: clearly not and yeah of course not.

504
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:12,759
Rym: that's not a requirement of IT.

505
00:31:13,463 --> 00:31:25,320
Rym: But the things I know and learned about like It's CPU architecture are on a higher level than this and I've never cared about how memory is actually protected, right?

506
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,268
Scott: So you got basically almost.

507
00:31:27,288 --> 00:31:30,020
Rym: I just assume like the OS does that it is protected.

508
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:37,683
Scott: I don't care how almost everything in a computer right is pretty much just writing on reading memory from locations Right.

509
00:31:37,964 --> 00:31:41,216
Scott: so like oh you want to you know talk to the network card.

510
00:31:41,236 --> 00:31:49,340
Scott: well the network card Probably has some memory location and when you you know move memory to that location then the CPU sends that data out.

511
00:31:49,924 --> 00:31:51,054
Scott: You know instead of writing it.

512
00:31:51,114 --> 00:31:56,480
Scott: so I say RAM You know it writes it to wherever the network card is and that's how you send on the lowest level.

513
00:31:56,781 --> 00:32:01,678
Scott: Talk to other things in the computer is by reading and writing data from addresses, right?

514
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,388
Scott: It's how you talk to the RAM.

515
00:32:03,428 --> 00:32:05,180
Scott: It's how you talk to anything right yeah.

516
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:18,349
Scott: So if you're running an assembly program and that assembly program is that ring three where the normal user programs run And you try to say yo CPU yeah see that memory location.

517
00:32:18,409 --> 00:32:19,893
Scott: I want you to write these bits there.

518
00:32:20,114 --> 00:32:21,117
Rym: No windows is there.

519
00:32:21,137 --> 00:32:26,250
Scott: yeah, it's like Dude, that's like yeah, that's that's where the Linux kernel is a memory.

520
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:40,649
Scott: You're not allowed to write to that spot and the CPU itself Depending on what you're doing will stop you from reading or writing memory to different locations based on what ring Of security your assembly instructions have permission for now.

521
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:49,560
Rym: this what Scott just said is the very important distinction because an operating system Will protect things like if I try to mess with files or something that I'm not supposed to or install software.

522
00:32:49,924 --> 00:32:57,630
Rym: The operating system has all these controls But if I installed a different operating system Then the controls might be different.

523
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:58,554
Rym: right not exist.

524
00:32:58,574 --> 00:33:07,152
Scott: so your operating system And you know Linux kernel whatever you're running windows is running at ring zero Which is when you when you become root, that's you're running at ring zero.

525
00:33:07,212 --> 00:33:10,926
Scott: right you have permission to access all the devices And do all the user stuff.

526
00:33:11,228 --> 00:33:13,178
Scott: that even stuff users can't do.

527
00:33:13,198 --> 00:33:15,667
Scott: yeah You know all everything is open to you.

528
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:22,719
Scott: basically as far as like a user of a CPU is concerned a human being But it rings negative one negative two negative three.

529
00:33:23,761 --> 00:33:27,973
Scott: There's all sorts of stuff going on that the operating system can't mess with.

530
00:33:28,013 --> 00:33:30,360
Scott: the computer is just built into the hardware.

531
00:33:30,821 --> 00:33:38,984
Scott: Right the code that is running you know firmwares and whatnot to manage power and CPU stuff And whatever else.

532
00:33:39,085 --> 00:33:43,436
Scott: Intel decides that the operating system shouldn't mess with it just happens right?

533
00:33:43,596 --> 00:33:50,800
Scott: so this Minix operating system When you turn your computer on turns on puts its in has a little bit of RAM that only belongs to it.

534
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:53,269
Scott: So a piece of your RAM is like locked away.

535
00:33:53,289 --> 00:33:56,420
Scott: if you tried to write code that was like read from that RAM.

536
00:33:56,787 --> 00:34:09,437
Scott: Right If you tried to read data from that memory location And you're running your code as root on your normal operating system Right you would just get back a bunch of F's or you know an arrow.

537
00:34:09,456 --> 00:34:10,280
Scott: who knows what would happen?

538
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,125
Rym: But it does actually.

539
00:34:11,145 --> 00:34:13,420
Rym: is your RAM chips or just have its own embedded storage?

540
00:34:13,581 --> 00:34:14,003
Scott: No, it just.

541
00:34:14,103 --> 00:34:14,366
Scott: it just.

542
00:34:14,507 --> 00:34:16,540
Scott: it's an operating system running on your computer, right?

543
00:34:17,001 --> 00:34:18,043
Scott: It doesn't have any.

544
00:34:18,304 --> 00:34:22,235
Scott: like the code of it is stored in the CPU Northbridge Southbridge.

545
00:34:22,275 --> 00:34:22,396
Scott: No.

546
00:34:22,416 --> 00:34:23,098
Scott: They don't know where it is.

547
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:24,822
Scott: actually It's.

548
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,978
Scott: I think it moved into the CPU itself like this code in there.

549
00:34:28,321 --> 00:34:29,208
Scott: But it you know it it.

550
00:34:29,592 --> 00:34:30,580
Scott: it's like a normal program.

551
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,632
Scott: It loads into memory when the computer starts in your RAM.

552
00:34:34,014 --> 00:34:44,340
Scott: if you could use a super Microscope and look at your RAM while it's functioning and read the zeros and ones and look at the electrons You could read the program in your RAM after it loaded in there, right?

553
00:34:45,081 --> 00:34:46,306
Scott: And then how does it run?

554
00:34:46,346 --> 00:34:48,875
Scott: it sends assembly instructions to the CPU to be executed.

555
00:34:49,156 --> 00:34:50,120
Scott: those assembly instructions?

556
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:50,743
Scott: Just run it.

557
00:34:50,783 --> 00:34:53,320
Scott: ring negative three and can do whatever the fuck they want.

558
00:34:53,782 --> 00:35:00,680
Rym: So if you were able take these bits in this part of memory I don't care if it's protected by anything and move them over here, right?

559
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:06,093
Scott: So under normal circumstances if someone roots your computer, right and they become root they can do.

560
00:35:06,173 --> 00:35:12,334
Scott: they can run assembly instructions at ring zero Which would give them permission to basically you're already boned right there.

561
00:35:12,455 --> 00:35:13,780
Scott: They're at turning on your webcam.

562
00:35:13,961 --> 00:35:16,574
Scott: They're reading all your hardware files in your hard drive.

563
00:35:16,594 --> 00:35:17,619
Scott: They're doing everything, right?

564
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:30,198
Scott: But if you can run assembly instructions on a computer at ring negative one negative two negative three Right, then not only can you do all those things obviously which much greater difficulty because you're gonna have to.

565
00:35:30,258 --> 00:35:30,980
Scott: it's like redirect.

566
00:35:31,261 --> 00:35:36,260
Scott: You're working on the assembly level trying to figure out like alright where in memory is this webcam?

567
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,938
Scott: Let me try to talk to it with assembly.

568
00:35:38,382 --> 00:35:46,420
Rym: Like think of it like if you were trying to hack someone's hard drive by poking wires Into the side right with a voltimeter, but it listening out what's going on.

569
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:54,798
Scott: If you can do it It's worth doing and it's definitely within That the capabilities of a single human being let alone an organized group with money.

570
00:35:54,818 --> 00:36:00,160
Scott: now It can be done easily especially since the IME has access to like the network card.

571
00:36:00,441 --> 00:36:02,908
Scott: They could just upload your data download your data all kinds of stuff.

572
00:36:03,089 --> 00:36:04,934
Scott: And here's the real problem.

573
00:36:05,476 --> 00:36:06,940
Scott: Is that your code?

574
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:07,441
Scott: That's right.

575
00:36:07,482 --> 00:36:10,053
Scott: You know, let's say you write an anti a virus checker.

576
00:36:10,274 --> 00:36:11,680
Scott: that's running as what root?

577
00:36:12,164 --> 00:36:13,759
Scott: You can't even see this shit happening.

578
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:17,614
Scott: You can put a root kit on someone's computer running at this low level.

579
00:36:18,035 --> 00:36:21,286
Scott: that is undetectable Completely undetectable.

580
00:36:21,306 --> 00:36:21,870
Scott: You wouldn't even know.

581
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:28,553
Scott: the only way to know that anything's happening Is that you somehow very closely examine the CPU and notice the hot.

582
00:36:28,934 --> 00:36:35,260
Scott: the CPUs didn't execute my instructions Executed some other instructions for a second and then it went back to executing my instructions.

583
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:35,942
Rym: So think about that.

584
00:36:35,982 --> 00:36:39,071
Rym: you could have a perfectly clean Windows OS.

585
00:36:39,111 --> 00:36:40,013
Rym: that is literally not.

586
00:36:40,214 --> 00:36:44,286
Scott: you can have a motherboard and a CPU That have been compromised.

587
00:36:44,426 --> 00:36:46,754
Scott: Yep, and that physically it's like.

588
00:36:46,794 --> 00:36:47,697
Scott: well, what am I gonna do?

589
00:36:47,757 --> 00:36:48,760
Scott: burn them now?

590
00:36:49,060 --> 00:37:00,400
Rym: these kinds of problems have been a problem in the enterprise world for a long time because When you're managing servers like real-world like practical examples, you often need out-of-band ways to control things.

591
00:37:00,481 --> 00:37:19,483
Rym: so there's a lot of ways to like control a computer from the outside like from a special network or a special connection or a Special card you stick in that could do similar sorts of things and securing those as a big part of corporate stuff, but This is that built into every computer Automatically not

592
00:37:19,563 --> 00:37:21,028
Scott: just built into a special server.

593
00:37:21,048 --> 00:37:25,000
Scott: Imagine if you're able to compromise the management engine of say a server farm.

594
00:37:26,445 --> 00:37:28,379
Scott: You would not simply spy on them.

595
00:37:28,821 --> 00:37:39,400
Scott: you would simply take their computers and start mining coins because you could basically schedule all the CPU cycles for yourself and None for whatever software is actually running on those machines.

596
00:37:39,741 --> 00:37:42,048
Scott: so suddenly all these computers are not doing that.

597
00:37:42,088 --> 00:37:51,260
Scott: basically all appear to be easily be frozen because they just stop executing the Instructions that the operating system wants to execute and they're executing some other instructions and you can't even see what's happening.

598
00:37:51,260 --> 00:38:00,066
Rym: You can even I guess be clever and have the OS be a minimally responsive and just make it think that it's got plenty of Space like spending plenty of capacity.

599
00:38:00,086 --> 00:38:06,360
Scott: You could just you could you could draw you could send some fake screenshots to the Looks like something's happening.

600
00:38:07,021 --> 00:38:08,138
Scott: Nothing's actually happening.

601
00:38:08,521 --> 00:38:13,055
Rym: So this kind of problem like people have always talked about it like Scott right people have.

602
00:38:13,536 --> 00:38:16,364
Rym: for a while people have been like hey Do you know this IME thing is here?

603
00:38:16,826 --> 00:38:18,130
Rym: What if someone like whoo-doo-doo?

604
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:23,811
Scott: Yeah, it's always been this theoretical but known threat, but only like super hardcore.

605
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:27,989
Scott: crazy security nuts were like I'm getting an open-source computer with open-source hardware because I can't.

606
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:31,280
Scott: I can't stand the the threat of this Intel management engine the government.

607
00:38:31,565 --> 00:38:34,623
Scott: They got my computer Yeah But you know They probably do like.

608
00:38:34,844 --> 00:38:35,788
Rym: it was theoretical.

609
00:38:35,868 --> 00:38:41,350
Rym: in the same way that if any of you are our age or young or older You might remember tempest vulnerabilities.

610
00:38:41,932 --> 00:38:43,800
Rym: tempest was the idea and it is gone now.

611
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:55,500
Rym: But the idea was that with old monitors CRT's cathode ray tubes the things that are literally obsolete now You don't have to worry about this because they basically acted like big antennas.

612
00:38:56,281 --> 00:39:07,100
Rym: There's a lot of reasons why theoretically if someone had a monitor you could get the same monitor And if you use the right kind of signals processing and other antennas you could pick up the electricity.

613
00:39:07,301 --> 00:39:10,820
Rym: That was being like the waves the data that was being sent to the monitor.

614
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:20,570
Rym: the same way a radio could pick up sounds from the radio struck to the images and there were Real proof-of-concept implementations of these kinds of vulnerability.

615
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:30,410
Scott: right like imagine your neighbor has a monitor and some antennas and then suddenly that monitor is showing everything that your monitor is showing and The ultra nerds who were crazy about this.

616
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:38,820
Rym: if you ran like old PGP you could literally Display, you know, they had a reader built in that had like quote-unquote tempest secure display.

617
00:39:39,241 --> 00:39:51,887
Rym: So you could read and it was basically notepad, but it was like gray with darker gray text to help limit the ability of a tempest attack, which was 99% of theoretical.

618
00:39:51,907 --> 00:39:52,189
Rym: back then.

619
00:39:55,261 --> 00:39:57,230
Rym: Only ultra nerds cared about this.

620
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:59,240
Rym: It was not a reasonable attack vector, right?

621
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:00,904
Rym: But it was there right.

622
00:40:00,924 --> 00:40:12,260
Scott: so the Intel management engine is mostly a concern to people because a you know While it does some things to manage your computer in an honest feature adding way It's like you don't really need it.

623
00:40:12,321 --> 00:40:16,253
Scott: If you just removed it You wouldn't even know that it was removed as long as your computer turned on.

624
00:40:16,293 --> 00:40:18,724
Scott: you removed it in such a way that your computer Still turned on.

625
00:40:19,126 --> 00:40:19,368
Scott: you would.

626
00:40:19,468 --> 00:40:24,133
Scott: only you would only miss it if you were using like Motherboard power management features or something like.

627
00:40:24,153 --> 00:40:25,399
Scott: you might not even know it's gone.

628
00:40:26,142 --> 00:40:37,220
Scott: But meanwhile its existence creates this theoretical threat by which somebody could totally own your computer And you would never know the government could actually mess it that all the computers that have Intel chips everywhere.

629
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:40,260
Scott: It's totally shady and it's totally closed source mystery.

630
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:44,196
Scott: No one knows what the hell's in there except Intel people and they've kept it a secret for this long.

631
00:40:44,336 --> 00:40:47,427
Rym: and the extra danger Is that because we know that it's minix.

632
00:40:47,769 --> 00:40:51,140
Rym: it means that fairly arbitrary code can run on this thing.

633
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,994
Scott: Yeah, no longer do you have to write.

634
00:40:54,054 --> 00:40:55,240
Scott: so, you know, it's like ah, it's minix.

635
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,592
Scott: We can just write some minix apps to run on this thing.

636
00:40:57,652 --> 00:40:57,974
Scott: Yeah.

637
00:40:58,195 --> 00:41:06,039
Scott: Yeah anyway, so recently There was an actual for reals vulnerability discovered in this.

638
00:41:07,081 --> 00:41:09,409
Scott: That's the most threatening one yet.

639
00:41:09,469 --> 00:41:12,520
Scott: There have been a few in the past that were related.

640
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:17,151
Scott: I think there was a ring negative to one a couple years ago in 2015.

641
00:41:17,151 --> 00:41:29,879
Scott: I watched a video about where they use this like memory remapping thing with like HCI or something the weirdest or I forget what it was, but it was a really weird thing.

642
00:41:31,303 --> 00:41:35,490
Scott: but and it really wasn't a Like it could get you but it wasn't.

643
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:41,340
Scott: you wouldn't have to worry about it too much Right, but this is basically a USB thread.

644
00:41:41,521 --> 00:41:47,955
Scott: So and it's totally legit use a thing called J tag, which I always forget what it stands for Joint test action group.

645
00:41:47,975 --> 00:41:55,520
Scott: All right So J tag is basically this sort of universal connector protocol kind of thing for debugging hardware, right?

646
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:03,199
Scott: So let's say you're working on a circuit board with it with a CPU on it and you got to debug that CPU like one instruction at a time.

647
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:13,860
Scott: you plug in something to the J tag port and you plug that into your actual computer that you're writing code on and Now you can debug the instructions running on the CPU on this little tiny board, right?

648
00:42:14,201 --> 00:42:15,866
Scott: That's the kind of thing you J tag for.

649
00:42:16,147 --> 00:42:27,480
Scott: so just about every circuit board out there that has a CPU That's you know Made by a company has some sort of J tag connector for you for people to develop and debug things happening on the on the board.

650
00:42:28,966 --> 00:42:34,620
Scott: so They discovered an Intel management engine vulnerability where you buy a USB device.

651
00:42:35,141 --> 00:42:44,257
Rym: Right because I guess the management engine is access to USB which and this is a consequence of the fact that USB Universal serial bus that's what stands for I'm pretty sure.

652
00:42:44,398 --> 00:42:49,020
Rym: Yes Is has become the universal bus?

653
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:57,570
Rym: So anything that would have been done in a proprietary or different way for this kind of like IO that isn't network IO has all become USB.

654
00:42:57,671 --> 00:43:12,409
Scott: So now you can quite Realistically create some software put it on a USB stick Plug it into the USB port of any computer with an Intel chip that has the Intel management engine Which is effectively all of them or almost all of them.

655
00:43:12,549 --> 00:43:15,238
Rym: and then what use J tag to get access to IME?

656
00:43:15,338 --> 00:43:22,240
Scott: and now You that computer is your computer and no amount of reformatting the hard drive is gonna make a difference.

657
00:43:22,401 --> 00:43:29,454
Rym: so what's even funnier is I saw this tweet and I think they already deleted it, but USB right you plug it in and you can unplug it.

658
00:43:29,474 --> 00:43:37,399
Rym: Mm-hmm It's actually pretty trivial to make a USB physical device that once you plug it in a little hook comes up.

659
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,743
Rym: now You can't unplug it.

660
00:43:38,764 --> 00:43:39,868
Rym: Mm-hmm.

661
00:43:39,888 --> 00:43:42,940
Rym: There's no way to remove it sort of physically removing the actual you could.

662
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:45,715
Scott: I mean if someone did that's like on the front port on my computer.

663
00:43:45,735 --> 00:43:46,660
Rym: It's disabled the front port.

664
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:51,060
Scott: Well, I could disable the front port or I could just open the computer and cut the wire that goes to the front port.

665
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:55,900
Scott: Plug the front port from the motherboard, but if you go into the back port, I'd have to like pry.

666
00:43:56,762 --> 00:43:59,234
Scott: You know, I had to like use pliers or something and yank it out now.

667
00:43:59,294 --> 00:44:03,665
Rym: Here's why now again I don't know the full details of this vulnerability Like how.

668
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:05,335
Rym: all we know is that it's a proof of concept.

669
00:44:05,356 --> 00:44:06,060
Rym: that seems legit.

670
00:44:06,221 --> 00:44:12,245
Scott: The point is if you put the hooks in for somebody who get pliers you it's the time It takes to own them is already passed.

671
00:44:12,325 --> 00:44:12,526
Rym: Yep.

672
00:44:12,987 --> 00:44:14,091
Rym: The hooks are mostly just funny.

673
00:44:14,291 --> 00:44:24,900
Rym: Yes, but here is a like from my perspective the kind of Vulnerability that makes like the kind of practical use of this kind of vulnerability that makes it terrifying.

674
00:44:25,061 --> 00:44:28,540
Rym: So I have this like jelly comb mouse right for my laptop.

675
00:44:28,941 --> 00:44:32,192
Rym: It's this like cheapo wireless mouse as USB dongle.

676
00:44:32,233 --> 00:44:34,300
Rym: in it you plug the USB dongle in it's just a wireless mouse.

677
00:44:34,843 --> 00:44:37,199
Rym: That's how a lot of like mice and things work these days.

678
00:44:38,641 --> 00:45:03,440
Rym: Because of this vulnerability if I were say China as a state actor and I had a company that I had compromised that was selling cheap USB Wireless mice the dongle I might pull the vulnerability in there that would trigger JTAG to take over IME And then use that solely for the purpose of compromising random number generation when people are generating a cryptographic key.

679
00:45:04,762 --> 00:45:09,127
Scott: Yeah, I don't know why you're so racist against China But I see no fun.

680
00:45:09,408 --> 00:45:18,060
Scott: Russia's Russian state actor the US government I mean judge a state actor right is like what's stopping like just logitech from delivering a bunch of shitty mice?

681
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,524
Scott: You've seen you know Lenovo.

682
00:45:19,605 --> 00:45:24,820
Scott: We've seen Sony with their right, you know big real companies not just knockoff crap.

683
00:45:24,961 --> 00:45:25,724
Scott: Oh stuff right.

684
00:45:25,804 --> 00:45:32,658
Scott: real things that you would buy at Staples could theoretically be Compromised and have evil spywares in a US.

685
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,730
Scott: Buy a USB stick from like SanDisk right.

686
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:40,720
Scott: obviously none of these companies that I'm mentioning have had any of these things happen.

687
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:50,553
Scott: This is all theoretical right, but the most trustworthy things you can imagine buying and plugging into USB port Theoretically could have some sort of thing.

688
00:45:50,593 --> 00:45:51,920
Scott: and then your computers are owned.

689
00:45:52,161 --> 00:45:56,515
Rym: Yeah, and it's owned in a way that is literally impossible to detect right now.

690
00:45:56,836 --> 00:45:57,920
Scott: yet, so you can't detect it.

691
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:07,570
Scott: But there have been many people recently Figuring out and getting really close or close enough To solutions to removing IME from your computer.

692
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:13,169
Scott: so you do something and now your computer doesn't have IME anymore Just has some blankness and your computer still boots.

693
00:46:13,309 --> 00:46:15,738
Rym: now again to all the things we're talking about.

694
00:46:15,878 --> 00:46:18,900
Rym: assume That Intel is not a malicious actor.

695
00:46:19,395 --> 00:46:38,710
Rym: Yeah But if you are at the point where your legitimate threat vector Involves Intel itself being directly compromised either you're a paranoid nut job, or you are a super serious for real James Bond style spy and One of those is more likely than the other.

696
00:46:38,991 --> 00:46:41,160
Rym: yes, you've got to trust someone.

697
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:44,680
Scott: Mm-hmm I mean you know you gotta also have a good chip at some point.

698
00:46:44,921 --> 00:46:48,200
Rym: But that's kind of why I mentioned you know when I said China or Russia like they have a state actor.

699
00:46:48,762 --> 00:46:54,120
Rym: I'm not worried about a company like Logitech being directly corporate malicious actors.

700
00:46:54,284 --> 00:46:54,920
Scott: Not too much.

701
00:46:55,041 --> 00:47:06,480
Rym: but I am worried about Say the US government going to a company like that and saying we are forcing you to do this and also you'll be arrested if You tell anyone I'm more worried about or like what is more confidence at the factory.

702
00:47:06,641 --> 00:47:09,814
Scott: Oh, no, yeah, what deploys something is way more common.

703
00:47:09,854 --> 00:47:11,079
Rym: this happens kind of often.

704
00:47:11,581 --> 00:47:18,017
Rym: USB stick like company does a promotion and gets a USB device that gets outsourced to a company.

705
00:47:18,318 --> 00:47:20,499
Rym: that company Itself is not corrupt.

706
00:47:20,761 --> 00:47:27,499
Rym: They're just lazy and someone hacks that that manga factories network and just gets malware injected into.

707
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:35,920
Scott: Suppliers are for all the chips and that perfectly boring Logitech mouse You just bought who knows like something could be on there and the mice work just fine.

708
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:39,300
Scott: So they pass QA and then people plug them in don't even know anything's wrong.

709
00:47:39,683 --> 00:47:41,680
Scott: And then next thing you know everyone about this mouse.

710
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:45,828
Scott: This is a computer is infected with like the most evil Magic and you wouldn't even know.

711
00:47:45,868 --> 00:47:48,740
Scott: you could not know for years right this Intel management things.

712
00:47:49,981 --> 00:47:58,634
Scott: It's like nine years and we're starting to figure stuff out here because hardware is so complex and the shit is so low-level That you know, it's real hard to figure shit out.

713
00:47:58,895 --> 00:48:04,897
Rym: Yeah, there could already be stuff We didn't even know and I'm in the long run in terms of catching these sort of things earlier.

714
00:48:05,057 --> 00:48:14,574
Rym: It's It's really hard to say because a lot of the neckbeards will argue that yeah back in the old days I got a full schematic of the like my processor when I bought a computer.

715
00:48:14,634 --> 00:48:18,951
Rym: and it's like yeah because your computer was a 286 welcome to the modern computer had 10k breath.

716
00:48:19,152 --> 00:48:23,867
Rym: Yeah, like you could make a physical Explains what's going on inside of that chip?

717
00:48:23,907 --> 00:48:28,819
Scott: You could draw all the bits onto a piece of paper and keep track of them with a pencil.

718
00:48:30,981 --> 00:48:32,547
Rym: So this is all just interesting.

719
00:48:32,587 --> 00:48:34,373
Rym: That's really all we have to say right now.

720
00:48:34,433 --> 00:48:36,139
Rym: Just be aware that all this exists.

721
00:48:36,159 --> 00:48:46,398
Rym: and uh I don't know I'm curious if anyone out there is actually in the kind of situation where this is a legitimate threat that threat vector that you actually Care about directly, right?

722
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:55,873
Scott: I mean, you know It's just something to be aware of when you see all the talking going on and the only recommendation I can make to you is to always update your shit, right?

723
00:48:56,014 --> 00:48:56,737
Scott: Don't do anything.

724
00:48:56,757 --> 00:48:57,620
Scott: That's not trustworthy.

725
00:48:57,981 --> 00:49:01,492
Rym: Don't plug in random USB devices that you find on the street, right?

726
00:49:01,512 --> 00:49:02,776
Scott: And also we I have.

727
00:49:02,796 --> 00:49:04,040
Scott: there's a thing you can buy online.

728
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:07,751
Scott: I have it's called a USB condom with and it's exactly what it sounds like.

729
00:49:08,453 --> 00:49:10,379
Scott: and basically what if I put my exploit in?

730
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:11,224
Rym: there There's a tiny chip.

731
00:49:11,244 --> 00:49:11,747
Rym: You don't know about.

732
00:49:11,767 --> 00:49:12,753
Rym: did you take it apart and see?

733
00:49:12,995 --> 00:49:15,911
Scott: no, okay You got to trust somebody.

734
00:49:15,931 --> 00:49:21,494
Scott: Yeah so and what it is is basically it's USB on one side and USB on the other side.

735
00:49:21,514 --> 00:49:24,645
