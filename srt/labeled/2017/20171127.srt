1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,131
Rym: It's Monday November 27th.

2
00:00:11,493 --> 00:00:11,936
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:11,956 --> 00:00:12,600
Rym: That's good.

4
00:00:12,781 --> 00:00:20,330
Rym: And this is GeekNights in the year 2017. tonight we're talking about how to decide what technology to buy.

5
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,227
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:24,512 --> 00:00:31,610
Rym: So despite being in the city for a long time I've been in the area of them, but I never actually been to the clusters like I'd never gone inside them.

7
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:32,197
Scott: I've been there.

8
00:00:32,378 --> 00:00:33,290
Scott: I've been there many a times.

9
00:00:33,431 --> 00:00:34,579
Scott: When I was going I was a kid.

10
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:35,103
Scott: we would drop.

11
00:00:35,123 --> 00:00:39,329
Scott: when you drove to New York We would go down the Henry Hudson Parkway and see the cloisters out the window.

12
00:00:39,681 --> 00:00:43,044
Scott: Yeah The car and I always wanted to go there because it looks like a castle.

13
00:00:43,144 --> 00:00:44,550
Scott: it is technically a castle.

14
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:49,425
Rym: It's basically the piece of all these castles and cathedrals and churches.

15
00:00:49,445 --> 00:00:54,039
Scott: right for anyone who doesn't know It's obvious that castles exist in Europe.

16
00:00:54,220 --> 00:01:08,390
Scott: castles don't exist in North America unless you count like Bannerman Castle as tech ruins or you know people who are weird and decided to build a castle even though Castle was now an old style of construction that no longer was necessary anyway.

17
00:01:09,391 --> 00:01:13,710
Scott: So why the hell is there a castle in New York City and the north of Manhattan is?

18
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:26,362
Scott: Because FDR went and got all these pieces of castles from other places in the world Most of which were just gonna be destroyed or in disrepair and brought them there and made a little museum Which is technically part of the met.

19
00:01:26,463 --> 00:01:26,644
Rym: Yep.

20
00:01:26,664 --> 00:01:27,950
Rym: You don't have to actually pay to go in.

21
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:34,322
Rym: It's suggested donation and if you Suggestedly donate the ticket they give you also works at the Met right.

22
00:01:34,342 --> 00:01:38,636
Scott: so the main feature of the cloisters is a. it's cool Architecture because it's like a castle.

23
00:01:38,837 --> 00:01:40,203
Rym: it is really cool B.

24
00:01:40,243 --> 00:01:41,830
Scott: It's at the top of a hill in an ice park.

25
00:01:42,052 --> 00:01:43,369
Rym: That park is also really great.

26
00:01:44,092 --> 00:01:53,636
Scott: See it houses many like artifacts of like Christian medieval times yep, which are Shockingly like.

27
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:58,010
Rym: we're looking at this one painting a lot of Jesus II shit in there Like why is there this Renaissance painting there?

28
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,865
Rym: Then it's like no, this is actually from the Netherlands in the 1300s and holy fuck.

29
00:02:02,905 --> 00:02:03,728
Rym: This guy could draw.

30
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:05,953
Scott: Yeah And the most.

31
00:02:06,374 --> 00:02:11,170
Scott: the number one reason that people go there is because it houses the famous unicorn tapestries.

32
00:02:12,072 --> 00:02:15,090
Rym: There is a conspiracy around that unicorn tapestry.

33
00:02:15,271 --> 00:02:20,585
Scott: When I was there the last time I was there There was a tour group looking at the tapestries.

34
00:02:20,726 --> 00:02:28,249
Scott: at the same time I was and some moron was like hey unicorns real and everyone laughs But there's like 40 year old dude sort of believed in unicorns.

35
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,460
Scott: for real.

36
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,554
Rym: I Guess it was too soon friend.

37
00:02:31,594 --> 00:02:32,457
Scott: Why is he asking?

38
00:02:32,658 --> 00:02:35,970
Scott: Why is he asking a tapestry expert about cryptozoology?

39
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:37,252
Rym: I mean one.

40
00:02:37,493 --> 00:02:40,144
Rym: maybe he was just a poorly attempting a joke.

41
00:02:40,164 --> 00:02:55,210
Rym: No, no but uh - I. Well, I remembered a certain person in my high school who didn't seem to know that World War two it happens and this became a As we started studying it and this person did not.

42
00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:02,910
Rym: They expressed incredulity and as the unit went on got increasingly distraught and it became readily apparent.

43
00:03:03,031 --> 00:03:08,640
Rym: They literally did not know about the war in the Pacific Like at all, they thought only half of the war happened.

44
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:11,670
Rym: like they didn't know that America and Japan had fought a war.

45
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:13,916
Rym: Alright, and it was.

46
00:03:13,996 --> 00:03:16,503
Rym: it was a fascinating individual I recall.

47
00:03:16,784 --> 00:03:17,787
Rym: but here's the thing.

48
00:03:17,927 --> 00:03:23,632
Scott: I know it's hard You know, this is I don't want to spend too much time in the opening bit but like yeah at what point It's like?

49
00:03:23,672 --> 00:03:25,221
Scott: I wasn't born with that knowledge.

50
00:03:25,321 --> 00:03:27,593
Scott: Yeah at what point of my life Did I know that?

51
00:03:27,694 --> 00:03:30,385
Scott: and how come when I was in history class?

52
00:03:30,445 --> 00:03:31,489
Scott: It wasn't a shock to me.

53
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,998
Scott: Yeah, like I like I don't know.

54
00:03:34,038 --> 00:03:37,630
Scott: It's not like I watched that many war movies before high school.

55
00:03:37,811 --> 00:03:42,030
Rym: I mean we didn't study World War two as like a unit until high school.

56
00:03:42,512 --> 00:03:50,399
Rym: But when I got to like 10th grade and like now's the World War two unit Because I had a Jewish education I was more aware.

57
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:53,548
Scott: but no other non Jews are also don't have this problem.

58
00:03:53,588 --> 00:03:55,575
Scott: Yeah But I don't know.

59
00:03:55,936 --> 00:04:02,549
Rym: but the unicorn tapestry is notable in that despite growing up in Michigan I knew all about that unicorn tapestry.

60
00:04:02,952 --> 00:04:09,739
Rym: And in fact, there's a picture of it in my Western Civ book my textbook Which I have because I stole it when I left high school.

61
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,752
Rym: and it's over there and there what there's a page that has the unicorn Tapestry.

62
00:04:13,772 --> 00:04:15,538
Rym: well one of the unicorn tapestries.

63
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:18,690
Scott: it's weird because on the one hand I feel like the unicorn tapestries.

64
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,725
Scott: They're sort of overhyped and overrated, but they're really impressive.

65
00:04:21,785 --> 00:04:26,089
Scott: and on the other hand I really like tapestries and I really like the unicorn tapestries a lot.

66
00:04:26,651 --> 00:04:29,460
Scott: It's almost like the initial D of old arts where it's like.

67
00:04:29,761 --> 00:04:32,530
Scott: I feel like it's not as great as it's not.

68
00:04:32,831 --> 00:04:35,640
Scott: It's not as great as all the hype but at the same time.

69
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,843
Scott: I really like it a lot.

70
00:04:37,204 --> 00:04:37,425
Rym: Yep.

71
00:04:37,746 --> 00:04:47,482
Rym: So, uh The picture in my textbook from Michigan of the unicorn tapestry Was the one that most people see and the one that's on all the merchandise

72
00:04:47,522 --> 00:04:51,317
Scott: where the unicorn is sitting down and there's like a circle And there's a big and the unicorn

73
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:52,422
Rym: has this look on its face.

74
00:04:52,482 --> 00:04:54,270
Scott: Like hey, yeah, what's up?

75
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:58,243
Rym: So you want to ride me bro all the other.

76
00:04:58,283 --> 00:04:59,890
Scott: have you had sex with anyone?

77
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:03,829
Scott: Cuz if you have yeah, I might not talk to you or let you see me or let you ride me.

78
00:05:04,112 --> 00:05:14,797
Rym: So let me describe briefly all that, you know If you've never felt the horn before well, maybe maybe this is an action for that's the tapestry the kids know and are like Yeah, that's that's the great unicorn.

79
00:05:14,817 --> 00:05:15,902
Rym: Look at that chill unicorn.

80
00:05:15,922 --> 00:05:17,007
Rym: He says a bunch of other ones.

81
00:05:17,027 --> 00:05:17,630
Scott: They tell a story.

82
00:05:17,861 --> 00:05:20,298
Rym: Yeah The story is bunch of medieval shithead.

83
00:05:20,378 --> 00:05:27,145
Rym: saw a unicorn purifying water and then the rest of them are them Hunting down and brutally murdering the unicorn to steal its horn.

84
00:05:27,366 --> 00:05:28,386
Scott: Yeah the end Yep.

85
00:05:28,651 --> 00:05:33,988
Rym: And in fact the pillow because you can buy a pillow at the store at the cloister that has the unicorn on.

86
00:05:34,028 --> 00:05:42,228
Rym: it has the nice In the circle, but if you look at it You can see they've kind of removed all the blood that's on the unicorn from his injuries.

87
00:05:42,248 --> 00:05:44,818
Scott: Mm-hmm And how do you know you corns a dude?

88
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,927
Rym: Uh, yeah, I could be a lady.

89
00:05:46,987 --> 00:05:47,369
Rym: We don't know.

90
00:05:48,312 --> 00:05:51,122
Scott: In fact industry it could be a transgender unicorn.

91
00:05:51,182 --> 00:05:53,430
Rym: Yeah, we do not know the identity of that unicorn.

92
00:05:53,611 --> 00:06:00,029
Rym: All we know is that those medieval fuckheads murdered it and it's covered in blood in most of the tapestries of it.

93
00:06:00,571 --> 00:06:05,570
Rym: And yet most people who have not been to the cloisters only know this picture of this chill unicorn sitting in a circle.

94
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,036
Rym: They don't know that's a cage.

95
00:06:07,096 --> 00:06:08,282
Rym: There's a chain around its neck.

96
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:08,663
Scott: Nope.

97
00:06:09,346 --> 00:06:10,250
Rym: But yeah, that was a chill time.

98
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:11,657
Rym: It was a good time up there chill time.

99
00:06:11,737 --> 00:06:13,947
Scott: I hear what the brutally dehorned unicorn.

100
00:06:14,008 --> 00:06:21,890
Rym: Yeah The tapestry where they got the horn is the worst because the top of it is like all these Spears through the unicorn and blood everywhere.

101
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:32,829
Scott: If you're if you're nerdy and you want to do nerdy type things related to cloisters and you come to New York once a year They have a medieval timey Ren Faire type thing there that you can go to.

102
00:06:33,332 --> 00:06:39,189
Rym: I'm sure there will be people there who will be more than happy to explain to you everything You never wanted to know about medieval swords.

103
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:49,580
Rym: We should go there cosplaying as Star Trek dudes in the holodeck a bloody unicorn and a unicorn hunter Perhaps a triptych of different states of the unicorn.

104
00:06:49,801 --> 00:06:54,121
Rym: I'll get a whole bunch of people make I'm into triptychs after being there Too because there's a lot of triptychs.

105
00:06:55,713 --> 00:06:58,324
Rym: It's a Monday, so I guess we won't talk about unicorns.

106
00:06:58,344 --> 00:06:59,650
Rym: we'll talk about technology.

107
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:01,658
Rym: So here's some news.

108
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:02,883
Scott: I got it's like a two news.

109
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,610
Scott: is that are really one news, right?

110
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:20,026
Scott: So the first news is that someone you know did a study and they found out that Pokemon go Right because people were playing it so much Did quite a lot of damage in terms of traffic related incidents for people playing Pokemon go.

111
00:07:20,126 --> 00:07:26,330
Scott: if Pokemon go had not been created There are people who would be less hurt less dead and less cars.

112
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,514
Scott: That would be less damage.

113
00:07:27,594 --> 00:07:32,750
Rym: half a million dollars in additional damage 31 additional injuries two additional deaths.

114
00:07:33,031 --> 00:07:39,070
Scott: Mm-hmm Pokemon go murdered two people real people in the real world.

115
00:07:39,491 --> 00:07:41,376
Scott: That's not something to like joke about.

116
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:42,699
Scott: that's an actual thing.

117
00:07:42,739 --> 00:07:48,494
Scott: the people at the company that makes Pokemon go by writing that software Murdered two people.

118
00:07:48,575 --> 00:07:53,690
Rym: now as a counterpoint before you get to the second in direct your second news that'll tie all this together.

119
00:07:55,332 --> 00:08:03,730
Rym: The mere act of adding bike lanes had similar effects because more people started biking Mm-hmm, even though the bike lanes probably made any individual biker safer.

120
00:08:04,111 --> 00:08:09,089
Rym: It actually increased the number of bike death, but it decreased actual overall deaths.

121
00:08:10,212 --> 00:08:11,800
Scott: Queens Boulevard used to be the Boulevard.

122
00:08:11,881 --> 00:08:13,590
Scott: every study that shown is bike lanes.

123
00:08:13,871 --> 00:08:16,880
Scott: They slow traffic and reduce overall right.

124
00:08:17,101 --> 00:08:26,353
Scott: so it's the total amount of damage Right, even though maybe someone else decided to bike who wouldn't have biked without the bike lane And they died.

125
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:36,226
Scott: the overall number of people who are harmed or died in all traffic related incidents are reduced when bike lanes are added And there's also a side story for that one person who died to other people were saved at least.

126
00:08:36,327 --> 00:08:45,866
Rym: there's a side story I have to get into about how anyone who's making technology should at least think about the potential ramifications of that technology and make ethical decisions, right?

127
00:08:45,906 --> 00:08:46,047
Scott: so?

128
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:50,866
Scott: Secondly you got this guy that I didn't know about and he has this spreadsheet.

129
00:08:50,886 --> 00:08:53,437
Scott: It's an Excel spreadsheet That's got like a zillion sheets in it.

130
00:08:53,718 --> 00:08:55,547
Scott: You can actually get the spreadsheet and mess with it.

131
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:56,109
Scott: Good luck.

132
00:08:57,772 --> 00:09:17,401
Scott: And what it is is it's basically this thing where he tries to take into account all possible factors of New York transit of all kinds and there's a few inputs and you change those inputs and you can go to All the other sheets and basically see what the effect would be on All these aspects of New York transit.

133
00:09:17,441 --> 00:09:24,168
Scott: and then sheets for like you know Buses and like all these different like a you know small things big things.

134
00:09:24,228 --> 00:09:26,482
Scott: It's like oh What would the effect be on this you know.

135
00:09:26,904 --> 00:09:27,770
Scott: so this bridge?

136
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:28,312
Scott: It's like alright.

137
00:09:28,332 --> 00:09:32,766
Rym: It tells you right and it how rigorous is the science and math behind this?

138
00:09:32,887 --> 00:09:33,910
Scott: I have no idea.

139
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:34,733
Scott: But it's it's.

140
00:09:35,114 --> 00:09:36,218
Scott: it's pretty impressive.

141
00:09:36,238 --> 00:09:39,048
Scott: I downloaded opened it and was like what the fuck.

142
00:09:39,088 --> 00:09:39,670
Scott: and then I deleted.

143
00:09:41,073 --> 00:09:47,244
Scott: But anyway While you know that aspect of it is questionable, right?

144
00:09:47,325 --> 00:09:53,030
Scott: It's like, you know a lot of the you know If you read the article, it's like oh, well, where did you get the numbers for calculating this?

145
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,518
Scott: And it's usually from like various studies and things.

146
00:09:55,578 --> 00:10:02,130
Scott: it's like oh someone studied that for every X we spend here It causes X so that that goes into the spreadsheet, right?

147
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:19,670
Scott: it sort of basically combines all these things together and the main purpose of it is to evaluate the effect of Possible, you know congestion pricing which is something's been discussed in New York a lot where we're gonna charge people money to drive a car Below some Street in Manhattan.

148
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:24,566
Scott: So basically in Manhattan in the busy area the where the big buildings are.

149
00:10:24,586 --> 00:10:34,141
Scott: if you want to drive your car there We're gonna charge you some money and we're gonna use this to pay for trains and buses and all the other good stuff Because no one has the balls.

150
00:10:34,181 --> 00:10:39,063
Scott: just tax rich people and take all their money Or anything like that, even though some people are asking for it.

151
00:10:39,123 --> 00:10:39,968
Scott: No one's actually doing it.

152
00:10:41,056 --> 00:10:46,787
Scott: so This spreadsheet you can use to figure out exactly, you know, well, what have we raised?

153
00:10:46,807 --> 00:10:47,630
Scott: the price too much?

154
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,344
Scott: Oh, it turns out that people just stop driving there.

155
00:10:50,485 --> 00:10:51,310
Rym: That's what I want?

156
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:56,768
Scott: Yes, you know, but it's like well, what would the actual total cost to society be?

157
00:10:56,788 --> 00:10:56,888
Scott: Right?

158
00:10:57,851 --> 00:11:00,606
Scott: Well, you know what areas would be helped or harmed and whatnot.

159
00:11:00,686 --> 00:11:04,038
Scott: So This spreadsheets really cool.

160
00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:07,552
Scott: the Pokemon go thing is pretty interesting But why are these?

161
00:11:07,592 --> 00:11:30,329
Scott: the same news is because clearly we have reached a point where even though we don't have perfect Information right we have the ability to at least accurately enough estimate I don't want to say predict but estimate the total cost to society of any particular project or policy or whatever.

162
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:40,519
Scott: yet Almost never do people take in this total cost of anything into account and when they make decisions People like people just start uber.

163
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:43,730
Scott: they just start companies without thinking about the total cost, right?

164
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:46,509
Rym: Well, cuz they're probably thinking about their own personal profit, right?

165
00:11:46,890 --> 00:12:01,586
Scott: Oh one of the interesting facts in this in the article from the guy with the spreadsheet is When you drive a car into Manhattan on a weekday you cost The everyone else at least $160 in externalities, right?

166
00:12:01,606 --> 00:12:07,130
Scott: You're basically doing $160 of damage to society if you drive a car into Manhattan on a weekday.

167
00:12:07,754 --> 00:12:08,258
Scott: Why doesn't?

168
00:12:08,358 --> 00:12:09,325
Scott: but we don't charge you 160 dollars.

169
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:15,447
Scott: You're basically stealing a hundred and sixty dollars from all of society as a whole whenever you do that.

170
00:12:15,929 --> 00:12:21,504
Scott: So Like nobody's charging you 160 bucks to do that and we absolutely should.

171
00:12:21,926 --> 00:12:23,170
Rym: well there was yet another.

172
00:12:23,332 --> 00:12:24,449
Rym: I'm not gonna try to dig it up right now.

173
00:12:24,571 --> 00:12:26,610
Rym: There's another article that I read that was talking.

174
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:41,863
Rym: It was I think was the New York Times But it was talking about the story of how and why the New York City subway has become so ridiculously underfunded despite being so like Literally and directly crucial to the economy of America as a whole and

175
00:12:42,003 --> 00:12:44,516
Scott: used by a shit ton of people who all pay for it millions

176
00:12:44,557 --> 00:12:52,030
Rym: and millions of people Unarguably, I'm of the mind that the New York City subway should be free for anyone to ride and be funded solely through tax dollars.

177
00:12:52,131 --> 00:12:54,970
Scott: It can be free if you tax people other people enough.

178
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:59,710
Scott: If you set I think they said the congestion price at like some likes number.

179
00:13:00,051 --> 00:13:03,401
Scott: Yeah, they could make all buses and all subways free forever.

180
00:13:03,843 --> 00:13:06,030
Rym: Yep, but then I see the guy who made this spreadsheet.

181
00:13:06,192 --> 00:13:07,210
Rym: I'm just skimming this article.

182
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:14,369
Rym: He's something like oh, but then it increases this traveler's amenity Which is like the benefit that travelers get out of the system.

183
00:13:14,591 --> 00:13:17,870
Rym: Yeah, and he already like he seems to make a lot of pro car arguments.

184
00:13:18,732 --> 00:13:27,090
Scott: The point is is that You know, I'm not I'm not vouching for the the reality of the spreadsheet, which is why I use much language like estimate.

185
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,375
Scott: Yeah, right.

186
00:13:28,495 --> 00:13:38,450
Scott: What I'm saying is that in general right people, you know There's lots and lots of people are doing large projects that are all over the news things like Bitcoin.

187
00:13:38,636 --> 00:13:59,889
Scott: It's like well They just fucking do it and everyone starts doing things without considering the environmental impact or any you know Impacts on you know, all sorts of things, right and It's understandable that like back in the day before we had computers that that was a thing because it's like yeah You first of all, I didn't have the knowledge let alone the power to you know.

188
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:04,570
Scott: Consider what would all the consequences be of doing this large thing?

189
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:18,501
Scott: but now to at least enough extent we have the power to do that and It must I think is actually morally mandatory when doing any large project To consider the total cost to society.

190
00:14:18,601 --> 00:14:18,742
Scott: hard

191
00:14:18,762 --> 00:14:19,885
Rym: to say though because you

192
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:26,174
Scott: if you're gonna make Pokemon go You better consider what's gonna happen when you make Pokemon

193
00:14:26,194 --> 00:14:34,421
Rym: go example does not take into account any of the benefits of self to society in terms of all the people that have walked Around who previously were not walking.

194
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:39,706
Scott: Yeah, I mean you got to count everything And make it you want to count Pokemon go before you release that shit.

195
00:14:39,726 --> 00:14:41,655
Scott: make a giant spreadsheet if you wanna.

196
00:14:41,977 --> 00:14:51,186
Rym: if you want to count everything then you have to worry about the fact that Quantitative analysis a lot of these things is both one extremely difficult or possibly dubious.

197
00:14:51,206 --> 00:15:02,946
Rym: Mm-hmm and two the goals of anything like what thing to optimize for or what counts as a cost versus a benefit is Highly partisan in America.

198
00:15:02,967 --> 00:15:08,425
Rym: Mm-hmm I mean certain people would say that anything that reduces the number of drivers is harm.

199
00:15:08,766 --> 00:15:10,230
Rym: Whereas I would say it's a benefit.

200
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:20,467
Rym: Yep, so that's part of the reason why this isn't so simple as let's just do the calculation because we can't agree on what we're calculating how we're calculating it and how to interpret the output.

201
00:15:20,627 --> 00:15:26,064
Scott: even if Somebody was to disagree with me and say more cars is better, right?

202
00:15:26,706 --> 00:15:27,368
Scott: It would be.

203
00:15:27,568 --> 00:15:33,090
Scott: at least They should at least do some amount of reasonable effort.

204
00:15:33,331 --> 00:15:38,090
Scott: So at least they know that the thing they're doing is going to make more drivers like they want, right?

205
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:44,329
Scott: As a pull I'd rather have that where they want the opposite thing of me and they're effective and intelligent and going about it.

206
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:50,792
Scott: Then just doing something they think will have more drivers without even estimating in advance Like.

207
00:15:50,832 --> 00:15:55,436
Scott: it's an interesting example, you know the best The best knowledge available.

208
00:15:55,777 --> 00:16:00,068
Rym: I'm not even so much concerned about this sort of like projecting forward because of all the perils.

209
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:02,407
Rym: I've noted Hitherto.

210
00:16:03,132 --> 00:16:09,090
Rym: But I'm more interested in the fact that we're not even dealing with the problems where we don't need to project anything.

211
00:16:09,451 --> 00:16:15,330
Rym: We have empirical historical data showing that the solutions we are attempting to problems fail.

212
00:16:15,411 --> 00:16:33,263
Rym: The best example of this is highways and freeways the fact that we add more lanes to highways and freeways to reduce congestion yet empirical evidence over the course of like 60 years shows that that literally Increases top drive times and increases congestion.

213
00:16:33,303 --> 00:16:34,287
Rym: It does not decrease.

214
00:16:34,307 --> 00:16:34,689
Rym: Mm-hmm.

215
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:39,890
Scott: So well, I mean, you know cuz you have a when you making you got to fix the bottlenecks, right?

216
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,169
Scott: Look at George Washington Bridge.

217
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,662
Scott: It's like the bridge still only has so many lanes.

218
00:16:43,762 --> 00:16:45,149
Scott: adding more lanes to it doesn't help.

219
00:16:45,532 --> 00:16:48,875
Scott: You got more lanes going in than there are on it So it's that.

220
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:52,815
Rym: but look at like LA no matter how many more lanes you add anywhere It doesn't.

221
00:16:52,915 --> 00:16:54,582
Scott: actually there's gonna be a bottleneck somewhere.

222
00:16:54,622 --> 00:16:56,370
Scott: They don't have ten lanes on Main Street.

223
00:16:56,792 --> 00:17:00,550
Scott: So it's handling the freeway doesn't do you any good if there aren't ten lanes and all the other roads.

224
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:13,109
Rym: It appears that even if they eliminate effectively all bottlenecks like say you got ten lanes from every destination to every other destination What ends up happening in practice is that more people start driving because driving is more convenient.

225
00:17:13,521 --> 00:17:19,510
Scott: Mm-hmm The fact that there is congestion is actually just have to have so many lanes to accommodate as many people as you have.

226
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:23,388
Scott: So if you got you know as many people as New York City just every road should be 50 lanes.

227
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:28,064
Scott: Cover the whole of Manhattan with just solid pavement and roads and nothing else.

228
00:17:28,223 --> 00:17:32,059
Scott: Yeah, and then we can all drive no problem What was that silly plan from?

229
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:34,469
Rym: like the Moses did the Robert Moses days of?

230
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:38,230
Rym: Fill in the East River and put buildings on it and make a big highway.

231
00:17:38,704 --> 00:17:44,790
Scott: Yeah There's also the one where you want to like make a road like a bridge that goes over Manhattan so you could just drive from Brooklyn in New Jersey.

232
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:50,230
Scott: Yeah, like you'd be up above like 30 something the avenue just like on a bridge going all the way across.

233
00:17:51,053 --> 00:17:52,206
Rym: Anyway, we need more mass transit.

234
00:17:52,408 --> 00:17:55,163
Rym: Yeah So I got a little.

235
00:17:55,223 --> 00:18:04,438
Rym: not really a news news but it's something that might be interesting to you guys because a long time ago back in 2008 we did a show on net.

236
00:18:04,438 --> 00:18:05,362
Scott: 2008 was a long time ago.

237
00:18:05,422 --> 00:18:05,643
Scott: Yeah.

238
00:18:05,864 --> 00:18:07,290
Rym: Okay network attached storage.

239
00:18:07,551 --> 00:18:11,708
Rym: We talked about the boxes with hard drives that you store files on in your house.

240
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:12,170
Rym: Mm-hmm.

241
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,592
Rym: So where you go listen to that episode, I'll link to it If you want to know.

242
00:18:14,672 --> 00:18:17,184
Scott: I still have the NAS that I bought way back.

243
00:18:17,364 --> 00:18:19,652
Rym: It's still here - mine It's an.

244
00:18:19,813 --> 00:18:22,442
Scott: it's a net gear like readiness and V plus.

245
00:18:22,623 --> 00:18:24,670
Rym: I got the net gear like - it's only got two drives.

246
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:25,613
Rym: It's a four bay.

247
00:18:25,734 --> 00:18:26,557
Scott: It kind of sucks.

248
00:18:26,637 --> 00:18:27,600
Scott: It's a little flaky.

249
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,310
Scott: Some of the features are a little man, but it works.

250
00:18:30,551 --> 00:18:31,735
Scott: It still works today.

251
00:18:31,755 --> 00:18:32,618
Scott: I can still.

252
00:18:32,738 --> 00:18:34,264
Scott: it still has all my files safely.

253
00:18:34,304 --> 00:18:35,850
Scott: None of the drives in have ever crashed.

254
00:18:36,672 --> 00:18:43,389
Scott: The power supply in it actually failed and I had to get a replacement which I replaced myself and it totally worked.

255
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,284
Scott: I Mean my files are still on there.

256
00:18:47,325 --> 00:18:47,949
Scott: What can I say?

257
00:18:48,572 --> 00:18:52,950
Scott: I feel like I want to replace it, but that's a lot of money and the one I still work.

258
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,214
Scott: So it's hard to justify.

259
00:18:54,295 --> 00:19:03,907
Rym: if you want a goodness and you're someone like us Meaning that you generate a lot of like media content like you have you have workflows that involve big files.

260
00:19:03,948 --> 00:19:04,650
Rym: You're not normal.

261
00:19:04,891 --> 00:19:07,802
Rym: Yeah, because normal people there are very soon.

262
00:19:07,822 --> 00:19:12,810
Scott: You do not need a NAS 90% of the time No, but like if I'm recording fork, I like I'll do it.

263
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:14,320
Scott: I'm doing a lot of 1080p videos.

264
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,709
Scott: just a 4k is too big.

265
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,314
Rym: Yeah, guys we record in 4k.

266
00:19:17,455 --> 00:19:19,661
Rym: say we have two cameras on a panel of packs.

267
00:19:20,082 --> 00:19:24,976
Rym: That's 16 gigs per camera For one panel.

268
00:19:25,117 --> 00:19:31,278
Scott: and I do like, you know, even if I only video panels and nothing else my whole life That's how many panels do we do a year?

269
00:19:31,298 --> 00:19:34,089
Scott: Oh my god times about 20 gigs each.

270
00:19:34,855 --> 00:19:36,509
Scott: Right if I don't want to delete anything.

271
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:46,505
Scott: It's like I could just make the video then delete all the raw source material, but that I feel wrong about that Especially because I have gone into my art even though not once ever have I gone back into the.

272
00:19:46,866 --> 00:19:48,231
Rym: I have gone back a couple Times.

273
00:19:48,593 --> 00:19:55,689
Rym: one time I went back to remaster a video Removing a clip that had some copyright troubles and re-render it.

274
00:19:56,272 --> 00:20:07,544
Scott: The main reason I keep all this stuff is because a I feel it's wrong to delete data but also be You know, you can't see stories, you know some old person.

275
00:20:07,584 --> 00:20:14,327
Scott: they go into a you know They die and someone moves into the house and looks in the attic and finds a trove of old something.

276
00:20:14,407 --> 00:20:21,566
Scott: but right I got I got silly but I gotta leave behind that trove So a newspaper article can be written about me after I die.

277
00:20:21,586 --> 00:20:22,210
Rym: Well think about this.

278
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:25,284
Scott: Like wow, we found this trove of old videos from the early 2000s.

279
00:20:25,344 --> 00:20:32,810
Rym: a lot of the stuff We know about like what it was like in New York City and like the 20s is because of just random photos shitheads took.

280
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:42,970
Scott: Yeah, it's like you look at like you see these photos of old-timey New York and you're like, whoa And it's like I take photos like that every day those photos just boring as hell because they're like current day, New York.

281
00:20:43,352 --> 00:20:49,670
Scott: But if I just keep that photo around for 50 years It'll be old-timey New York and that photo will be married a hundred.

282
00:20:49,730 --> 00:21:04,750
Rym: Yeah, like an award-winning photo if I just hold on to it for 70 years 100 years from now Someone finds Scott's b-roll of like some random packs and they're like This is actual video from inside the first penny arcade Expo unplugged before it became the government.

283
00:21:05,071 --> 00:21:05,793
Scott: Yeah, look at like.

284
00:21:06,335 --> 00:21:09,785
Scott: look at like the handful of photos you see from 70s nerd cons.

285
00:21:09,865 --> 00:21:13,110
Rym: It's like oh My I mean, I'm excited.

286
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:28,997
Rym: There's a picture a super low-res picture of the first I think was the second RIT anime club meeting in the year 2000. that shows me and Scott and pretty much all the friends like our entire crew from that era Sitting in different parts of this room.

287
00:21:29,017 --> 00:21:34,905
Rym: Mm-hmm seeing that photo is amazing, even though the photos like 60 pixels across.

288
00:21:35,107 --> 00:21:42,087
Rym: Yeah So, uh, yeah in one 2000 right now, you probably don't need an ass.

289
00:21:42,127 --> 00:21:42,950
Rym: do not do this.

290
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:56,806
Rym: but if you're like us and you need a Centralized place to put data from multiple devices because if you don't need multiple devices Just put a bunch of fucking hard drives in your regular computer and like raids one them.

291
00:21:56,886 --> 00:21:57,749
Rym: It's totally fine.

292
00:21:58,876 --> 00:22:07,530
Rym: I have five terabytes of raid one Like so ten terabytes rated into five terabytes and that's directly attached to six gig SATA in my computer.

293
00:22:08,213 --> 00:22:12,790
Rym: I'm using like eight hundred gigs of it right now if I don't count like garbage I'm just working.

294
00:22:12,892 --> 00:22:15,116
Scott: Yeah, dad Daz is also not a bad.

295
00:22:15,136 --> 00:22:18,550
Scott: if you don't need the network part of an ass a Daz is not a bad idea.

296
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:24,890
Rym: Just get like a drobo or whatever that just USB or something USB 3 and plug into the back your computer Fast enough for most of what you're doing.

297
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:34,470
Scott: What's also good about that solution is if you're maybe gonna switch computers Like you could unplug it from one and plug it into a laptop and that's actually faster than say sending the files over the network.

298
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:35,353
Scott: Yep, you know.

299
00:22:35,413 --> 00:22:40,070
Scott: so it's not a bad idea to do the Daz based on unless you really need the network part.

300
00:22:40,511 --> 00:22:44,587
Rym: So here's why the simple parameters why I'm getting a new NAS one.

301
00:22:44,607 --> 00:22:48,470
Rym: I Me and Emily together both generate a lot of media.

302
00:22:48,931 --> 00:22:54,769
Rym: So we want a unified backup pipeline for all of our shit meaning it has to be huge.

303
00:22:55,633 --> 00:23:03,830
Rym: so I want a real NAS that I can set up quotas and SIF slash Samba mounts, you know SMB all that nonsense.

304
00:23:04,292 --> 00:23:12,522
Rym: So all our device all our main computers that create media can do fun stuff Like the automatic Windows backup of the entire file system.

305
00:23:12,562 --> 00:23:13,043
Rym: Why not?

306
00:23:13,063 --> 00:23:13,384
Rym: Mm-hmm.

307
00:23:13,545 --> 00:23:21,427
Rym: Keep like three of those Right, you know incremental backups and also to archive to it stuff that I'm not actively working on.

308
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:27,706
Rym: and then Because I want to I want to have a full pipeline Because it's a real NAS instead of the crappy netgear.

309
00:23:27,746 --> 00:23:28,269
Rym: I got up there.

310
00:23:28,751 --> 00:23:33,405
Rym: I could do something like have it back itself up once a month to Glacier.

311
00:23:33,425 --> 00:23:45,604
Rym: Uh-huh, and I think the best solution for someone in that prosumer Low-level professional workflow is a Synology DS 1517 plus.

312
00:23:45,644 --> 00:23:52,404
Scott: yes, it all G's are pretty good the cute apps I just got feeling the Synology ones you look online it like there.

313
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:54,089
Scott: that software does like everything.

314
00:23:54,149 --> 00:23:54,712
Rym: Yep No, there's.

315
00:23:54,952 --> 00:23:59,290
Rym: there's multiple levels like Snellie's a lot of devices, but generally there's always two of every kind.

316
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:04,430
Rym: There's the one that's pretty much only for home people and there's the one that's kind of aimed at small office business.

317
00:24:04,892 --> 00:24:08,770
Rym: The latter one is way faster and more reliable and better in pretty much every way.

318
00:24:09,611 --> 00:24:11,196
Rym: So it's probably worth it to spend the extra money.

319
00:24:11,878 --> 00:24:15,570
Rym: So the 1517 plus has enough horsepower.

320
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:19,305
Rym: It's like a computer to where I can run like all the internal house services.

321
00:24:19,365 --> 00:24:19,626
Rym: I need.

322
00:24:19,767 --> 00:24:20,530
Scott: Yeah, that's another thing.

323
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,989
Scott: These NAS is provide a lot of features.

324
00:24:23,931 --> 00:24:28,770
Scott: Some of them might be redundant with your router like you can use it as a DHCP server or DNS server.

325
00:24:29,172 --> 00:24:30,678
Scott: Some of them have HDMI outputs.

326
00:24:30,699 --> 00:24:31,482
Scott: you can put videos.

327
00:24:31,743 --> 00:24:31,964
Scott: Let's see.

328
00:24:32,024 --> 00:24:33,190
Scott: Oh, you don't have an HD PC.

329
00:24:33,814 --> 00:24:41,330
Scott: You can plug the NAS into your TV Put video files on the NAS and then the NAS can actually play them and send them out to the TV through HDMI.

330
00:24:42,351 --> 00:24:43,014
Rym: I think.

331
00:24:43,034 --> 00:24:43,877
Rym: leave it run dockers.

332
00:24:43,937 --> 00:24:48,938
Rym: I could like put a getter up up there and just have it like run on my NAS I use as a print server.

333
00:24:48,958 --> 00:24:51,610
Scott: I have the printer plugged into the nest because my printer is USB.

334
00:24:51,811 --> 00:24:52,656
Scott: It doesn't have.

335
00:24:52,796 --> 00:24:55,010
Scott: it does not have its own network service.

336
00:24:55,351 --> 00:24:59,607
Scott: So you plug it into the NAS and now you every every device in the house can print.

337
00:24:59,868 --> 00:25:05,610
Rym: I used to do that But now I have a fancy like modern brother laser color printer and it just prints wirelessly and it just works.

338
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:12,850
Scott: Yeah newer mine is a also, you know as an older black and white laser jet that is not have any network capability.

339
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:14,818
Rym: Yeah, this crazy printer was so cheap.

340
00:25:14,879 --> 00:25:16,004
Rym: It was cheaper than it was.

341
00:25:16,024 --> 00:25:16,204
Rym: Yeah.

342
00:25:16,245 --> 00:25:17,490
Scott: Mine was also so cheap.

343
00:25:17,571 --> 00:25:18,664
Scott: I just bought it way long ago.

344
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:27,930
Rym: Yep I only bought this one because the old laser printer I had The toner ran out and the toner didn't cost that much less than just buying a brand new printer.

345
00:25:28,211 --> 00:25:32,650
Scott: Anyway, so but yeah NAS is do a lot of stuff and not just store your files these days.

346
00:25:32,911 --> 00:25:46,239
Rym: The other reason is I want it to be this separate thing because the danger of modern malware which can get even smart people is that if you get like a crypto crypto locker kind of malware and You have a Daz plugged into your computer.

347
00:25:46,501 --> 00:25:48,490
Rym: Guess what the Daz gets encrypted, too.

348
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:52,470
Scott: It'll be very difficult for a evil crypto locking malware to get to your NAS.

349
00:25:52,811 --> 00:25:57,170
Rym: Yeah, let alone even if it gets to the NAS sure it's not gonna get to the glacier backup.

350
00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:02,770
Scott: Yeah Well, this is one interesting thing people in talking about recently related to the big news of net neutrality.

351
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:07,870
Scott: Yeah, which is if we lose net neutrality you might end up in a situation where?

352
00:26:08,771 --> 00:26:09,338
Scott: You got a little.

353
00:26:09,581 --> 00:26:11,434
Scott: you know glacier You're a cloud back.

354
00:26:11,555 --> 00:26:15,430
Rym: I want to download your four terabytes of like every photo of your family for generations.

355
00:26:15,852 --> 00:26:17,440
Rym: That'll be ten grand for that bandwidth.

356
00:26:17,541 --> 00:26:18,123
Scott: It's like it's all.

357
00:26:18,164 --> 00:26:19,430
Scott: that's just metered bandwidth.

358
00:26:19,491 --> 00:26:20,430
Scott: That's not net neutrality.

359
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:26,468
Scott: But the point is they could block and or slow lane whatever your cloud backup provider is now.

360
00:26:26,709 --> 00:26:27,130
Scott: now what?

361
00:26:27,731 --> 00:26:27,992
Scott: Right.

362
00:26:28,334 --> 00:26:30,282
Scott: It's like I think actually backing up.

363
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:35,320
Scott: if you're doing only cloud backups I think you may want to yup like the new.

364
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,645
Rym: that is another reason why I'm.

365
00:26:36,665 --> 00:26:40,616
Scott: she may want to make sure you have local Backups once net neutrality is gone.

366
00:26:40,656 --> 00:26:45,949
Rym: My previous backup regime was Amazon cloud drive before they ruined it.

367
00:26:46,512 --> 00:26:56,821
Rym: so in the era before net neutrality was under a real threat and Amazon cloud drive existed I could pay 70 bucks a month for Infinite storage and you know what I did.

368
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:58,690
Rym: I uploaded like seven terabytes of shit.

369
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:01,260
Rym: I'm pretty sure people like me or why they shut that thing down.

370
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,930
Rym: Yep, but I was using cloud only backup.

371
00:27:04,051 --> 00:27:06,908
Rym: I was just putting stuff on Amazon cloud drive and saying fuck it.

372
00:27:07,089 --> 00:27:12,489
Rym: Yep It's not gonna download seven terabytes of crap and put it somewhere before the end of the year.

373
00:27:12,811 --> 00:27:15,009
Rym: I ain't paying like 400 bucks a month to keep it up there.

374
00:27:15,331 --> 00:27:19,510
Scott: I just want to also say I got you know, a lot of my files are not well organized.

375
00:27:20,692 --> 00:27:21,956
Scott: I'm sure that's true for everyone.

376
00:27:22,238 --> 00:27:24,205
Rym: miners almost really well organized.

377
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:27,079
Scott: My photos are well organized thanks to Lightroom, but nothing else is.

378
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:31,474
Rym: so the GeekNights archive is Organized by nature.

379
00:27:32,095 --> 00:27:33,981
Scott: I my video is not organized.

380
00:27:34,021 --> 00:27:36,207
Scott: Well, my video file is organized.

381
00:27:36,247 --> 00:27:36,628
Scott: I got my.

382
00:27:36,668 --> 00:27:37,250
Scott: I got Lightroom.

383
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:39,235
Scott: I mean premier projects like all over.

384
00:27:39,256 --> 00:27:51,650
Rym: I made a point of consolidating that and you know what setting up that pipeline like Making my premier workflow makes sense to anyone other than me and also makes sense to me because yours probably doesn't fully make sense.

385
00:27:51,731 --> 00:27:53,785
Rym: You're like you're trying to open a file and you're like, wait a minute.

386
00:27:53,806 --> 00:27:54,209
Rym: Where is it?

387
00:27:55,611 --> 00:27:58,762
Rym: It took me like two weeks of like every day.

388
00:27:58,862 --> 00:28:01,010
Scott: So I just want to say there's a strategy you can use.

389
00:28:01,071 --> 00:28:03,230
Scott: It's the Scott strategy for organizing files.

390
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:07,690
Scott: I did this way back in the day with mp3s and then luckily that was the end of mp3 collecting.

391
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,876
Scott: So I was safe folder based subfolders.

392
00:28:10,177 --> 00:28:14,710
Scott: make one folder name it old shit and try to get everything in there.

393
00:28:15,171 --> 00:28:16,074
Rym: Yep, right.

394
00:28:16,134 --> 00:28:17,980
Scott: Don't worry about organizing the old shit.

395
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,010
Scott: organize the new stuff just to have everything in the old shit folder.

396
00:28:21,452 --> 00:28:25,350
Scott: So put the old shit folder on the Nez and now on your brand new computer.

397
00:28:25,992 --> 00:28:37,210
Scott: Organize everything properly from from now on and like, you know come up make a folder for video projects Make one folder for each video you're making and now you're good forever more and all the old shit is in the old chip.

398
00:28:37,825 --> 00:28:47,440
Rym: now The only other rule that's very important any time you use something in the old shit folder put it in the new Place maybe move it first.

399
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:53,490
Scott: Maybe I mean if you're making a new video project Here's one of the sources for the new project is an old video from the old shit folder.

400
00:28:53,772 --> 00:28:56,010
Scott: Yeah, drag it into that folder for that new project.

401
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:58,620
Rym: Yeah I mostly organize my media now by.

402
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:05,464
Rym: where I took the footage like this is from PAX 2016 and then in there there's a folder like this is b-roll.

403
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:07,170
Rym: This is the panel we did.

404
00:29:08,194 --> 00:29:10,704
Scott: You know, the point is the old the main strategy.

405
00:29:10,725 --> 00:29:11,990
Scott: I'm trying to teach people is the old?

406
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:15,250
Scott: Oh, yeah, but Scott I put everything in the old shit folder strategy.

407
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:19,990
Rym: Do you have in your old shit folder an old shit folder that might have an old shit folder?

408
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:21,638
Scott: Because I do.

409
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:31,389
Scott: I have Only two layers deep of old shit folders my M. Oh, I have an old shit folder and it is mp3s and in that is an old shit folder even older mp3.

410
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:35,970
Rym: My oldest that's as deep as it goes on earth is my mp3 collection.

411
00:29:36,151 --> 00:29:40,995
Scott: Okay, so anyway, because I did organize it at one point That's why it only goes too deep.

412
00:29:41,557 --> 00:29:45,030
Rym: five bay nazis are the sweet spot right now.

413
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:45,894
Scott: I got four bay.

414
00:29:45,914 --> 00:29:46,920
Scott: I think four bay is good enough.

415
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,870
Scott: So you can get a big drives these days.

416
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:50,115
Rym: Yeah, so here's the other thing.

417
00:29:50,195 --> 00:29:53,750
Scott: like you have four eight terabyte drives 24 T. That's good enough for now.

418
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:56,767
Scott: Yeah, so I'm still living on four two terabyte drives.

419
00:29:56,807 --> 00:30:04,130
Rym: No problem Yeah, I got two five terabyte drives in my current computer and I'm looking at putting five eight terabyte drives in the NAS.

420
00:30:04,751 --> 00:30:08,020
Rym: Because not bad eight terabytes is the sweet spot right now.

421
00:30:08,281 --> 00:30:12,854
Rym: They're like 200 to 250 bucks for a 5400 rpm.

422
00:30:12,874 --> 00:30:14,840
Rym: and yes, you want a slower drive and a NAS.

423
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:15,523
Rym: don't be stupid.

424
00:30:15,763 --> 00:30:16,325
Scott: What's your hurry?

425
00:30:16,666 --> 00:30:17,810
Rym: Yeah, it's a NAS.

426
00:30:18,131 --> 00:30:19,856
Scott: If they even had they even sell.

427
00:30:19,876 --> 00:30:24,290
Scott: if you're not sure on Newegg Western Digital actually sell NAS drives.

428
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:27,223
Scott: I think a lot of it is just sort of like no bullshit mark.

429
00:30:27,364 --> 00:30:27,926
Rym: I looked into it.

430
00:30:27,946 --> 00:30:34,430
Rym: So I Think I recommend Western Digital because they seem to be the generally most reliable.

431
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:43,030
Scott: I mean, no, but I mean I'm time at the everyone all the different drive manufacturers these days are marketing Like these are sick drives that you should use for you're like, no, I learned why this?

432
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,529
Rym: Why I actually know the deal here.

433
00:30:46,831 --> 00:30:53,610
Rym: So and this is not a Western Digital ad but the black drives are the ones that are high performance.

434
00:30:54,313 --> 00:30:56,303
Rym: But the counterpoint is at least on paper.

435
00:30:56,444 --> 00:30:57,469
Rym: They are higher performance.

436
00:30:57,489 --> 00:31:00,722
Rym: Okay They're also louder they spin faster.

437
00:31:00,782 --> 00:31:02,770
Rym: They generate more heat and vibration.

438
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:04,880
Rym: But but they're faster.

439
00:31:05,404 --> 00:31:06,309
Rym: Don't put that shit in your NAS.

440
00:31:07,634 --> 00:31:09,850
Rym: They have the like blue which is like the normal drives.

441
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:13,876
Scott: If you don't want to just get a NAS and fill it with SSDs You can think of no.

442
00:31:13,916 --> 00:31:17,995
Scott: but like you think about how much space a three and a half inch drive takes up right now.

443
00:31:18,056 --> 00:31:20,268
Scott: think about how much space an m2 drive takes up.

444
00:31:20,288 --> 00:31:24,030
Scott: I Yes, so why can't I get a little tiny thing?

445
00:31:24,271 --> 00:31:28,427
Scott: That's got like 10 m2 drives in it and that's hide it away in a closet somewhere.

446
00:31:28,748 --> 00:31:29,330
Scott: It's just godspeed.

447
00:31:30,731 --> 00:31:32,435
Scott: Right, but has the IE lanes.

448
00:31:32,616 --> 00:31:37,269
Rym: because the problem is m2 is only useful if you plug it into PCIe.

449
00:31:37,852 --> 00:31:40,250
Rym: If you plug it into SATA, it's not really faster.

450
00:31:40,411 --> 00:31:45,810
Scott: I see someone just make a board that has a whole bunch of PCI ease and a controller chip and a network card.

451
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:50,530
Rym: Cuz those seep those lanes Lanes lanes back to the lanes.

452
00:31:51,733 --> 00:31:53,819
Scott: Make a chip that's got a thousand lanes on it.

453
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,103
Rym: Anyway, that's we'll.

454
00:31:55,384 --> 00:31:56,687
Rym: we'll talk about that in the future.

455
00:31:56,808 --> 00:31:57,129
Rym: Sure.

456
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:59,033
Rym: So Where's it?

457
00:31:59,053 --> 00:31:59,215
Rym: cuz?

458
00:31:59,295 --> 00:32:00,162
Rym: I want to wrap this up.

459
00:32:00,364 --> 00:32:01,190
Scott: gotta go to the metamoment.

460
00:32:01,471 --> 00:32:08,350
Rym: The deal with the five with those drives is that the NAS drives Western Digital splits into two kinds of NAS drives.

461
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:09,193
Rym: They're the red ones.

462
00:32:09,454 --> 00:32:11,442
Rym: There's the regular ones and the pro ones.

463
00:32:11,844 --> 00:32:16,319
Rym: the pro ones are louder Hotter and you probably don't want them.

464
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:17,745
Rym: In fact, you most definitely don't want them.

465
00:32:17,765 --> 00:32:18,870
Rym: They also cost a lot more money.

466
00:32:19,612 --> 00:32:27,630
Rym: The only reason you'd ever get those so-called pro Western Digital Reds for a NAS is if the NAS has more than five bays.

467
00:32:28,478 --> 00:32:38,731
Rym: the reason for this Ostensibly is that up to about five bays the vibrations from all these drives acting in sync is reasonable.

468
00:32:39,433 --> 00:33:00,822
Rym: if you have eight drives all in a giant as and they're all doing that of the same things you like raid five or eight six then Not only are the consequences of multiple failures more devastating the consequences of multiple failures are more likely because multiple simultaneous failures are more likely and Drives are prone to that synchronized vibration.

469
00:33:01,002 --> 00:33:06,592
Scott: Why not have the bays like individually like floating or something or Offsets.

470
00:33:06,612 --> 00:33:08,057
Scott: they're not all in the same position.

471
00:33:08,118 --> 00:33:11,570
Scott: or they're at angles or have half of them are vertical and have them horizontal.

472
00:33:12,296 --> 00:33:16,969
Rym: There's a lot of reasons for that But the way they are today, that's how any NAS you're gonna see is gonna be.

473
00:33:17,494 --> 00:33:19,229
Scott: I wonder how big data centers handle that problem.

474
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:29,227
Rym: Uh, they buy good drives and they use specialized harnesses or just use SSDs like you this to you unit where you just go SSD SSD SSD SSD you put like 32 of them in a row.

475
00:33:29,267 --> 00:33:33,201
Rym: Yeah Can I get one of those if you got like out like 80k?

476
00:33:33,242 --> 00:33:34,105
Rym: Yeah, let's do it.

477
00:33:34,547 --> 00:33:36,537
Rym: It'll be so loud We couldn't talk next to it.

478
00:33:36,638 --> 00:33:43,790
Rym: SSDs are loud or just the fan cooling Yeah, but anyway eight terabytes the sweet spot for three and a half inch drives right now.

479
00:33:44,271 --> 00:33:46,518
Rym: And ten terabyte is too much money.

480
00:33:46,538 --> 00:33:47,281
Rym: for how much you get?

481
00:33:47,542 --> 00:33:50,190
Rym: twelve terabyte is way too much money.

482
00:33:50,651 --> 00:33:52,397
Rym: It's good for a PC, but not for a NAS.

483
00:33:52,959 --> 00:34:00,809
Rym: the expensive Pro Red Western Digital NAS drives have Extra vibration dampening and extra environmental stuff to protect them from this stuff.

484
00:34:01,932 --> 00:34:08,210
Rym: The only other thing is you do RAID 5 or RAID 6 with a lot of drives because RAID 6 protects you against two failures.

485
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:16,126
Scott: My NAS has like its own custom RAID which is It's some sort of RAID 5 and I just said okay use whatever RAID you want.

486
00:34:16,146 --> 00:34:17,330
Scott: This is okay and it works.

487
00:34:17,571 --> 00:34:18,414
Rym: so here's the problem.

488
00:34:18,454 --> 00:34:30,650
Rym: if you have a lot of bays if a if a disk goes into NAS and you're using the equivalent of RAID 5 then if another drive goes before you You're only safe with one drive going down.

489
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:44,817
Rym: But it's worse because when you put a new drive in to replace it now all the existing drives Have to work overtime to rebuild the array into that new drive Correct increasing the chance that one will fail before it finishes Because those are the drives.

490
00:34:44,837 --> 00:34:47,210
Scott: I feel like you're still pretty safe with a RAID 5.

491
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:54,070
Rym: So I would go with RAID 6 if I had the 5 bay if I weren't gonna do this backup strategy to glacier.

492
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:58,910
Rym: If the RAID 5 the worst case scenario is in I lose a drive.

493
00:34:59,372 --> 00:35:01,159
Rym: I immediately put in the cold spare.

494
00:35:01,621 --> 00:35:03,690
Rym: the array fails before the cold spare finishes.

495
00:35:04,192 --> 00:35:07,003
Rym: I lose at most 30 days of data.

496
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,830
Rym: as I go back to my glacier backup.

497
00:35:09,233 --> 00:35:16,526
Rym: I'm willing to take that risk and that that gives daddy 32 terabytes of redundant storage for about two grand.

498
00:35:16,686 --> 00:35:17,830
Scott: if my crappy NAS.

499
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:23,470
Scott: That's a piece of junk that only had a power supply fail has kept me safe without even one failure.

500
00:35:23,631 --> 00:35:26,044
Rym: I've had two drives fail in that thing over the last.

501
00:35:26,204 --> 00:35:27,190
Rym: I'm feeling pretty good.

502
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:30,421
Rym: I've had two drives at the same time not at the same time.

503
00:35:30,502 --> 00:35:30,843
Rym: Okay.

504
00:35:31,144 --> 00:35:33,133
Rym: It's a two drive with RAID 1.

505
00:35:33,133 --> 00:35:39,330
Rym: So if I lost both, yeah So yeah, I'll link to the forum thread where I say exactly what I'm about to buy.

506
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,880
Rym: But this feels like the sweet spot.

507
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,269
Rym: and again, you only need this if you're like us.

508
00:35:51,152 --> 00:35:55,515
Rym: But anyway things of the day What do you got?

509
00:35:55,536 --> 00:36:10,710
Scott: so, you know, this is this is sort of genre of video article whatever where people like to Debunk experts at things particularly subjective things and the one that always comes to mind is like wine experts Like get some wine experts and they'll give them some wines without telling them what they are like.

510
00:36:11,071 --> 00:36:12,076
Scott: Oh, can you tell?

511
00:36:12,176 --> 00:36:14,505
Scott: and they can sort of not tell.

512
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:22,910
Rym: it's sort of best I've seen is there are some people who can tell but they'd like they're specially trained and they seem to not actually enjoy wine.

513
00:36:24,291 --> 00:36:27,340
Scott: Point is is that they're exposing the amount of bullshit.

514
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,624
Scott: Yeah is sort of outright.

515
00:36:28,865 --> 00:36:36,486
Scott: But anyway here I saw a link to this video today Where there was a cheese expert who is going to try to identify the more expensive cheese.

516
00:36:36,586 --> 00:36:43,910
Scott: and it's like I Thought at first is gonna be one of those videos where they're like, you know showing you that like cheese expert is bullshit or something.

517
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:47,530
Scott: But actually first of all, it wasn't a completely blind thing.

518
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:55,667
Scott: the cheese expert looks at the two cheeses a and B with their eyes and then taste the cheeses and then tells you which one is more expensive.

519
00:36:55,707 --> 00:37:04,050
Scott: right and First of all I think it's hard to argue after watching this video that cheese expert has a lot of bullshit in it.

520
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:10,046
Scott: Like they were able to successfully and correctly identify like every single fucking cheese.

521
00:37:10,166 --> 00:37:11,630
Rym: So fun fact.

522
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:19,849
Scott: I used to work with this awesome Greek dude at my old company and like they were able to tell you what kind of milk It was and like how long it was aged.

523
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:21,873
Scott: And like welcome.

524
00:37:21,914 --> 00:37:22,395
Scott: and it was like.

525
00:37:22,415 --> 00:37:29,021
Scott: this is a first of all you it watching this really made me appreciate cheese more Care about cheese more.

526
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:30,230
Scott: I learned a lot about cheese.

527
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:30,370
Scott: I

528
00:37:30,411 --> 00:37:34,003
Rym: went out and got some feta cuz we were gonna have like just like tomato

529
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:42,153
Scott: and it's clearly not an ad or anything because Like the person was able like I know exactly what cheese this is did not say any brands or anything Right,

530
00:37:42,414 --> 00:37:43,639
Rym: but I went out and got feta.

531
00:37:43,659 --> 00:37:49,270
Rym: cuz we're gonna make like a lunch in the office and I come back with it And it's just like in this nondescript bag like no label on or anything.

532
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:54,610
Rym: I bring this feta out and we start to eat it and he's like, why'd you get some bullshit Bulgarian feta?

533
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:56,190
Rym: Mm-hmm, and I'm like what?

534
00:37:56,991 --> 00:37:58,156
Rym: He's like, this is not Greek feta.

535
00:37:58,176 --> 00:37:59,160
Rym: This is Bulgarian.

536
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,847
Rym: Maybe it's American but ain't real.

537
00:38:00,867 --> 00:38:01,650
Rym: and he was right.

538
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:03,236
Rym: I bought like the cheap Bulgarian feta.

539
00:38:03,256 --> 00:38:06,890
Scott: Yeah, it's yeah, if you want to you know, learn something about cheese.

540
00:38:07,272 --> 00:38:13,279
Scott: I'm sure everyone but a lot of people listening to this who aren't lactose intolerant Most people I know really fucking love cheese.

541
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,685
Rym: Natalie's like me into this video.

542
00:38:14,785 --> 00:38:15,970
Scott: Oh, yeah, but it's like he's seen it.

543
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:16,715
Scott: It's like I'm.

544
00:38:16,735 --> 00:38:19,854
Scott: you know, I think most people are like me at least most people I know where it's like.

545
00:38:19,994 --> 00:38:20,657
Scott: you're not a cheese.

546
00:38:20,737 --> 00:38:22,183
Scott: nerd cheese isn't your hobby.

547
00:38:22,203 --> 00:38:23,187
Scott: You just cheese.

548
00:38:23,227 --> 00:38:23,870
Scott: it really delicious.

549
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:25,458
Scott: You always love to eat a cheese.

550
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,690
Scott: You also would love to learn about a cheese.

551
00:38:27,811 --> 00:38:30,830
Scott: It's just not something that comes to mind except when cheese is available.

552
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:35,150
Rym: That's why you need a friend like we go with Natalie will go out and come with like weird cheeses.

553
00:38:36,491 --> 00:38:40,844
Scott: So check out this cheese info here for a cheese layperson.

554
00:38:41,005 --> 00:38:41,446
Scott: good stuff.

555
00:38:41,707 --> 00:38:49,594
Rym: So speaking of Removing in for me deleting information why Scott can't delete these old videos of like packs 2008?

556
00:38:49,594 --> 00:38:57,630
Rym: so I found this Twitter thread and It's a real good Twitter thread about how someone wasted their day falling down this weird rabbit hole.

557
00:38:58,112 --> 00:39:04,171
Rym: So they found this picture of the Temple of Olympian Zeus in Athens from 1858.

558
00:39:04,171 --> 00:39:05,616
Rym: There's this thing on top of it.

559
00:39:05,636 --> 00:39:08,965
Rym: There's like this thing there in the phone in the picture.

560
00:39:09,065 --> 00:39:13,160
Scott: Yeah, so he's like What's that thing in this picture?

561
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:15,490
Rym: and then he looks at a picture of the restoration.

562
00:39:15,972 --> 00:39:20,387
Rym: There's no thing like that in the restoration, but there's a thing like that in this picture.

563
00:39:20,408 --> 00:39:21,010
Rym: Mm-hmm.

564
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:23,477
Scott: So then he goes maybe the restorations with the wrong angle.

565
00:39:24,019 --> 00:39:26,045
Rym: So there's not much to this ruin.

566
00:39:26,246 --> 00:39:27,570
Rym: Like it's just pretty tall.

567
00:39:27,851 --> 00:39:33,030
Scott: I mean, it's from Athenian times the shit old son way older than some piece of shit cloister.

568
00:39:33,452 --> 00:39:36,787
Rym: So then he finds in like a textbook or something.

569
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:41,422
Rym: That's all Older than the Parthenon another picture that doesn't have the thing on it.

570
00:39:41,643 --> 00:39:45,718
Rym: So he's like, alright, maybe someone added this thing Like no, it fell off.

571
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,109
Rym: No, it's so much crazier than that.

572
00:39:48,631 --> 00:39:59,872
Rym: so then he realized that the photo without the thing is the exact same photo as the photo with the thing and he Proved that the thing was clearly airbrushed out Mm-hmm.

573
00:40:00,233 --> 00:40:04,749
Rym: So the plot thickened and then he found this painting that shows the thing.

574
00:40:05,432 --> 00:40:08,281
Rym: Someone painted it with the thing and then he found another painting.

575
00:40:08,502 --> 00:40:13,959
Rym: then he found this like essay Someone wrote from a lot like from the 1700s.

576
00:40:14,401 --> 00:40:14,822
Rym: That was like.

577
00:40:14,862 --> 00:40:16,226
Rym: there's this thing like.

578
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,290
Rym: they mentioned the thing.

579
00:40:17,751 --> 00:40:25,050
Scott: Okay, and if you follow you sure this isn't a movie about a genie starring Sinbad the comedian.

580
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:36,815
Rym: If you follow this thread all the way to the end What the thing is is funny Crazy and Ridiculous together.

581
00:40:36,916 --> 00:40:37,619
Rym: it did exist.

582
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:40,070
Rym: It was a thing and now I know what that thing was.

583
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:42,583
Scott: Why doesn't someone just go there now and look at it cuz it's gone.

584
00:40:42,985 --> 00:40:43,970
Rym: Oh, it was removed.

585
00:40:44,655 --> 00:40:46,530
Scott: I mean, I meant the whole temple is still there, right?

586
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,395
Rym: Oh, yeah, but the thing was removed.

587
00:40:48,596 --> 00:40:53,250
Rym: the thing was added after this was built in ancient at like old times.

588
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:53,732
Scott: So it's not.

589
00:40:53,772 --> 00:41:06,059
Rym: the thing is not Athenian, but it was added to the Athenian thing Mm-hmm, and then someone else said what the fuck is this thing and removed it as it wasn't Athenian and There was very little documentation as to how or why.

590
00:41:06,259 --> 00:41:08,224
Rym: and this thread explains it all.

591
00:41:08,645 --> 00:41:10,630
Scott: and it was it perhaps Romans that added it.

592
00:41:11,031 --> 00:41:16,125
Rym: Oh, it ends with screaming hobos living on top of pillars demanding food from people who pass by.

593
00:41:16,145 --> 00:41:18,050
Rym: it goes crazy in a hurry.

594
00:41:18,552 --> 00:41:23,070
Scott: Okay, it's just some hostile architecture to keep hobos off the temple.

595
00:41:23,892 --> 00:41:30,650
Rym: It's so much better than that, but you end up with pictures like this of Saints sitting on top of pillars screaming at people, okay?

596
00:41:31,851 --> 00:41:33,859
Rym: This was a very fascinating thing that I read.

597
00:41:33,879 --> 00:41:36,589
Rym: all right, it's this guy this hobo guy.

598
00:41:37,911 --> 00:41:39,459
Rym: He's chained to the top of this pillar.

599
00:41:39,821 --> 00:41:40,987
Scott: Oh, is that what the thing is?

600
00:41:41,068 --> 00:41:43,595
Scott: Yeah People up there to punish.

601
00:41:43,735 --> 00:41:46,324
Rym: No, they've chained themselves up there to be closer to God.

602
00:41:46,786 --> 00:41:47,207
Scott: Good luck.

603
00:41:47,267 --> 00:41:47,950
Rym: It's good times.

604
00:41:48,391 --> 00:41:54,010
Rym: So some Christian nut jobs put it up there and then all then that our Turks removed them for it's complicated.

605
00:41:54,271 --> 00:41:55,155
Scott: You shoot arrows at him.

606
00:41:55,235 --> 00:41:55,778
Scott: I'll get him down.

607
00:41:55,999 --> 00:41:57,646
Rym: Yeah, or just don't bring them food.

608
00:41:57,666 --> 00:41:58,449
Scott: Oh rocks at him.

609
00:41:59,631 --> 00:42:01,959
Rym: So in the moment, we've been crazy busy.

610
00:42:01,979 --> 00:42:03,805
Rym: you notice we didn't do shows after back some plug.

611
00:42:03,845 --> 00:42:04,166
Rym: that's cuz.

612
00:42:04,206 --> 00:42:06,233
Rym: Scott apparently is dying of Tuberculosis.

613
00:42:06,614 --> 00:42:07,678
Scott: and then it was Thanksgiving.

614
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:11,070
Scott: Yep, but now up until the end of the month.

615
00:42:11,351 --> 00:42:14,810
Scott: We are doing Jack and shit, which means you're getting GeekNights episodes for four weeks.

616
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:16,761
Rym: Yep, and other associated projects.

617
00:42:16,821 --> 00:42:18,350
Rym: that includes that includes this one.

618
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:23,866
Scott: So this is the first of at least 18 nights episodes in a row and also much more important.

619
00:42:24,628 --> 00:42:32,638
Rym: in January There's gonna probably be like a couple weeks without a lot of GeekNights cuz we're gonna be presenting a ton of things gonna be New Year's there's gonna be mad.

620
00:42:32,658 --> 00:42:35,167
Rym: We're gonna be a MAGFest doing a bunch of panels.

621
00:42:35,267 --> 00:42:36,110
Scott: Can you hear it in the distance?

622
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:36,732
Rym: I hear him.

623
00:42:37,034 --> 00:42:37,417
Rym: What's that?

624
00:42:37,618 --> 00:42:38,242
Rym: Do you hear it?

625
00:42:38,262 --> 00:42:41,176
Rym: I Got a terrifying shirt off like toga.

626
00:42:41,196 --> 00:42:44,409
Rym: We're gonna be a PAX Unplugged doing at least one panel.

627

00:42:46,821 --> 00:42:48,450
Scott: Yes the PAX Unplugged already.

629
00:42:48,852 --> 00:42:53,450
Rym: You can see the number of packs is exceeded the ability of my brain to keep them all in order.

630
00:42:53,891 --> 00:43:01,998
Rym: I keep having these panic moments where I'll be like booking a hotel room for like pecks East and then be like, oh shit I didn't see my panels and they're like, oh wait.

631
00:43:02,058 --> 00:43:03,765
Rym: No, that's not even open yet.

632
00:43:03,825 --> 00:43:06,822
Rym: pecks East we I submit I got three packs is before pecks East.

633
00:43:06,843 --> 00:43:11,640
Rym: Yep So we will be at pecks out on Friday 4 p.m.

634
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:15,190
Rym: In the Bobcat theater talking about balance in game design.

635
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:19,446
Rym: This is a brand new GeekNights lecture courtesy of Scott cuz.

636
00:43:19,487 --> 00:43:20,370
Scott: Rym doesn't have anything new.

637
00:43:20,571 --> 00:43:23,590
Rym: Hey, do you know how much fucking work it took to make that Carcassonne panel?

638
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:25,077
Scott: I made this panel already.

639
00:43:25,137 --> 00:43:26,202
Scott: It's like 30% done.

640
00:43:26,262 --> 00:43:27,810
Scott: It took me like a couple hours.

641
00:43:27,951 --> 00:43:32,056
Rym: Yeah, it only took me like one day to make that Carcassonne panel But it was like one full day of like get.

642
00:43:32,097 --> 00:43:36,010
Rym: mostly I had to take pictures of Carcassonne tiles a lot of them.

643
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:37,789
Rym: That was a lot more word in front the old BGG.

644
00:43:38,833 --> 00:43:42,418
Rym: no, because Most people upload pictures of the BGG.

645
00:43:42,879 --> 00:43:44,786
Rym: upload them with the license of.

646
00:43:44,806 --> 00:43:45,810
Rym: you can't use this shit.

647
00:43:45,951 --> 00:43:46,995
Scott: Take a flatbed scanner.

648
00:43:47,036 --> 00:43:50,070
Scott: put all the Carcassonne tiles you can on it and the scan once now you get.

649
00:43:50,531 --> 00:43:54,224
Rym: That would be way more work than just setting up the cut it into a grid in Photoshop.

650
00:43:54,285 --> 00:43:55,670
Rym: That would be so much more work.

651
00:43:55,931 --> 00:43:59,125
Rym: I just took pictures of interesting Carcassonne situations.

652
00:43:59,285 --> 00:44:01,970
Scott: Anyway, uh, Use the app and take screenshots.

653
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:03,997
Rym: I'm gonna pick the next book club book real soon.

654
00:44:04,459 --> 00:44:08,715
Rym: lean in toward the new translation of the Odyssey like real hard I don't.

655
00:44:08,876 --> 00:44:10,463
Scott: you're not choosing as your book club book is.

656
00:44:10,503 --> 00:44:16,270
Scott: if you were actually gonna you know Make the good on your threat you would have done it already, but I don't know if it's still the case.

657
00:44:16,471 --> 00:44:25,399
Scott: But it was recently the case that Rym's favorite count of Monte Cristo Kindle version was like 57 cents or something like that the penguin book.

658
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,924
Scott: Oh, that's the good one, right?

659
00:44:26,964 --> 00:44:27,887
Scott: It was like 57 cents on Amazon.

660
00:44:29,012 --> 00:44:31,938
Scott: So I'm just like, oh 57 cent whatever.

661
00:44:32,099 --> 00:44:37,002
Rym: you should probably just read it anyway, even if I don't make it the book club Unlikely until I'm old man, but hey 57 cent.

662
00:44:37,022 --> 00:44:37,765
Rym: I was saying.

663
00:44:37,785 --> 00:44:39,774
Scott: I don't know if it's still true though Go take a look.

664
00:44:40,075 --> 00:44:44,994
Rym: All I'm saying is it's a lot of pages and something happens Every page.

665
00:44:45,014 --> 00:44:47,201
Rym: sure, there's no pages where nothing happens.

666
00:44:47,522 --> 00:44:49,067
Scott: So 10,000 things happen.

667
00:44:49,148 --> 00:44:49,348
Scott: It is.

668
00:44:49,388 --> 00:44:51,556
Rym: Yeah Yeah, it is not.

669
00:44:51,577 --> 00:44:52,942
Rym: it's like the Wheel of Time, right?

670
00:44:53,263 --> 00:44:56,054
Rym: It's not great expectations which to this day I never actually read.

671
00:44:56,636 --> 00:44:57,780
Scott: Ulysses the famous.

672
00:44:58,343 --> 00:45:00,290
Rym: I wrote multiple essays on great expectations.

673
00:45:00,632 --> 00:45:04,070
Rym: I know I can talk about miss Havisham forever and status house.

674
00:45:04,432 --> 00:45:07,730
Rym: I have no idea what actually happens in that stupid book pip and such.

675
00:45:08,294 --> 00:45:10,609
Scott: That's all I know is that it's the thing with the guy named Pip.

676
00:45:11,572 --> 00:45:14,750
Scott: You know less than me so, you know almost nothing it other than that it's a famous novel.

677
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:17,929
Rym: All I know is that to write essays on it in high school and I wrote them without reading it.

678
00:45:18,192 --> 00:45:19,345
Rym: Anyway, I got A's.

679
00:45:19,386 --> 00:45:23,143
Scott: I guess You should go on the internet and find GeekNights.

680
00:45:23,183 --> 00:45:35,780
Scott: in every place that GeekNights exist Which is every place that is on the internet you probably before net neutrality is gone You can still find us on YouTube and every social network and then once net neutrality is here Who knows if you'll be able to find us at

681
00:45:35,881 --> 00:45:36,022
Rym: all?

682
00:45:36,748 --> 00:45:42,687
Rym: So main bit Talking about how to kiss because we've recently like I bought a new computer.

683
00:45:42,767 --> 00:45:44,974
Scott: today is Cyber Monday.

684
00:45:45,094 --> 00:45:45,676
Scott: Whoo.

685
00:45:45,736 --> 00:45:50,107
Scott: Yeah, and let me tell you where people spend money for the sake of spending money.

686
00:45:50,407 --> 00:46:00,475
Rym: in my opinion there is nothing on sale for either Black Friday or Cyber Monday in the nerdy PC.

687
00:46:00,797 --> 00:46:13,789
Rym: can pro-sumer electronics area That is worth it, nope, everything that's on sale is either old inventory that people trying to get rid of Crappy stuff like the bottom tier

688
00:46:13,829 --> 00:46:20,523
Scott: T only stuff that would be good and on sale is stuff that is Incredibly low availability and is not worth the fight.

689
00:46:20,623 --> 00:46:26,730
Scott: in order to save that amount of money You could like to spend five hours fighting to save like a hundred bucks on something.

690
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:28,257
Scott: It's like dude in five hours.

691
00:46:28,378 --> 00:46:30,830
Scott: You could just work a job and make a hundred bucks even worse.

692
00:46:30,850 --> 00:46:38,689
Rym: So those NAS drives I want right like I was doing my research They're on crazy sale on Cyber Monday, and they're cheaper just normally on Amazon.

693
00:46:38,789 --> 00:46:41,696
Scott: So Yeah, oh you mean new egg Cyber Monday?

694
00:46:41,756 --> 00:46:41,977
Scott: Yeah.

695
00:46:42,017 --> 00:46:43,201
Rym: Yeah, but pretty much no.

696
00:46:43,421 --> 00:46:46,370
Rym: Cyber Monday tech sales seems to have anything worthwhile.

697
00:46:46,731 --> 00:46:47,434
Rym: No, it's always.

698
00:46:47,474 --> 00:46:51,250
Rym: it's literally like the laptop that is legit too slow for you to use.

699
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:55,270
Scott: Yeah, it's like I have a new egg wish list and a steam wish list and all these wish lists.

700
00:46:55,330 --> 00:46:59,670
Scott: I get notifications like whoa shit on your wish list is cheaper now because it's a sale day.

701
00:46:59,770 --> 00:47:03,470
Scott: But it's like yeah, but after the sale the price always goes down.

702
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:07,302
Scott: It just keeps going down and down and down forever until you get newer stuff.

703
00:47:07,503 --> 00:47:08,807
Scott: Yeah, new stuff is expensive.

704
00:47:08,888 --> 00:47:09,570
Scott: old stuff is cheap.

705
00:47:09,931 --> 00:47:15,526
Rym: Absolute RAM for your older computer is gonna be cheaper like a month from now than it is now.

706
00:47:15,847 --> 00:47:24,910
Rym: Yep, probably So, uh, we want to talk a little bit about how you how we at least like how you make the decision of what to Buy like how you actually do your research.

707
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:30,010
Rym: You're trying to buy like a NAS or a computer like the specific ways we figure this out.

708
00:47:30,211 --> 00:47:42,863
Scott: Well, first of all, I got to say a lot of people out there Right, especially I see on the internet a frequent comment is like hey, you know, I just got a Nintendo switch What are essential things I should get for it?

709
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:44,070
Scott: or hey, I just got an iPhone.

710
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:46,838
Scott: What are what are apps that I must have right?

711
00:47:46,858 --> 00:47:53,899
Scott: It's like this kind of thinking not just in technology But in all consumerism is wrong.

712
00:47:53,979 --> 00:47:57,510
Scott: thinking you're basically saying I just want to spend money.

713
00:47:57,570 --> 00:47:59,075
Scott: What the fuck should I spend it on?

714
00:47:59,356 --> 00:48:01,745
Scott: where which toilet should I throw money into?

715
00:48:01,825 --> 00:48:03,190
Rym: there's no orthogonal direction to go.

716
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:04,255
Rym: There's a third component.

717
00:48:04,557 --> 00:48:12,410
Rym: if someone said I am a gamer What are useful apps to have on my phone for tabletop gaming like scorekeepers and such?

718
00:48:12,830 --> 00:48:17,690
Rym: No, see that is different because that is still I have a task and I'm looking for tools.

719
00:48:17,911 --> 00:48:22,442
Scott: Okay, see, you know saying I'm a gamer what apps should I get is still.

720
00:48:22,503 --> 00:48:25,310
Scott: it's more specific but it's still not better enough.

721
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:25,992
Scott: It should be.

722
00:48:26,012 --> 00:48:28,580
Scott: well you wait until the exact moment.

723
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:30,827
Scott: You actually have a specific need.

724
00:48:30,867 --> 00:48:37,150
Scott: like holy crap I am here right now in my life and I'm trying to play a board game and I'm having trouble keeping score.

725
00:48:37,751 --> 00:48:42,384
Scott: Now I can ask what is the specific thing that will solve my problem?

726
00:48:42,464 --> 00:48:44,429
Scott: and then if it costs money then you buy it.

727
00:48:44,870 --> 00:48:48,159
Scott: Right, don't just go buying stuff right.

728
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:48,581
Scott: you

729
00:48:48,741 --> 00:48:49,022
Rym: only

730
00:48:49,122 --> 00:49:04,790
Scott: buy things that solve a problem you have We just talked about NAS is if you have not run into the situation in your life where you are facing a hardship And then have discovered that the hardship related to storage will be solved by a NAS and that is the best solution to your problem.

731
00:49:05,353 --> 00:49:08,410
Scott: Don't just go in looking at NAS and pricing them out, right?

732
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:17,089
Scott: You have to have the need for a thing comes first Then you do the research to find what is the best solution and then you go shopping.

733
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:17,954
Rym: now We're gonna skip.

734
00:49:17,974 --> 00:49:21,270
Rym: there is a separate problem of how do you know what your needs are?

735
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:22,996
Scott: Like what does you have a problem?

736
00:49:23,036 --> 00:49:26,671
Scott: There's something in your life that you are having trouble with people I'm playing.

737
00:49:26,711 --> 00:49:27,935
Rym: I'm playing a little devil advocate here.

738
00:49:28,296 --> 00:49:32,730
Rym: the people who clearly have a problem don't realize it's a problem.

739
00:49:32,951 --> 00:49:34,659
Rym: Well, they don't recognize.

740
00:49:34,819 --> 00:49:37,050
Scott: telling him how to shop isn't gonna help them, right?

741
00:49:37,691 --> 00:49:40,125
Scott: That's a different problem, which is you don't know you got a problem.

742
00:49:40,225 --> 00:49:41,050
Rym: But so think of it this way.

743
00:49:41,090 --> 00:49:41,713
Rym: There's a try fit.

744
00:49:41,733 --> 00:49:42,999
Rym: There's three elements.

745
00:49:43,039 --> 00:49:44,586
Rym: There's a triptych here you.

746
00:49:44,626 --> 00:49:47,055
Rym: there's the need Or the task.

747
00:49:47,096 --> 00:49:52,763
Rym: they're the same thing the task the thing you're trying to do That you either can't do now or want to be able to do better.

748
00:49:53,125 --> 00:49:57,901
Rym: There's the tool and Then there is the shopping.

749
00:49:57,942 --> 00:50:05,089
Scott: Yes, the actual purchasing of the thing Yes, so choosing the exact one and how much to pay get the best price for it, etc.

750
00:50:05,492 --> 00:50:12,143
Rym: So I will very rarely Occasionally, I'll poke around and be like are there hard drives that are cheap?

751
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:12,906
Rym: because I want to.

752
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:16,030
Scott: I want to be aware I'm just keeping I'm just collecting information.

753
00:50:16,262 --> 00:50:23,696
Scott: Yeah But I'm not buying unless I actually unless they have a bunch of full drives and go or buying a new computer and I'm going Oh shit, my drives are full.

754
00:50:23,756 --> 00:50:24,419
Scott: I need drives.

755
00:50:24,499 --> 00:50:27,068
Scott: I don't go randomly buying drives just because they're cheap.

756
00:50:27,731 --> 00:50:35,490
Scott: But if I'm in a situation where it's like, oh, I know I just but it I go to look at new I can see what drives cost just because I want to be informed of what the state of the world is.

757
00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:42,794
Scott: Yep So if you're the kind of person who buys computer, but even if I went to new egg and saw like 100 terabyte drive 10 bucks Unless I needed it.

758
00:50:42,814 --> 00:50:44,581
Scott: I wouldn't buy even the 10 bucks.

759
00:50:44,862 --> 00:50:49,169
Scott: Yep, cuz by they when I do need it They'll have thousand terabyte drive for five bucks.

760
00:50:49,611 --> 00:50:55,150
Rym: So I usually pretty much always first try to document for myself at least in my brain.

761
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:59,126
Rym: But sometimes I'll write it down or usually I'll draw something like what do I?

762
00:50:59,166 --> 00:50:59,950
Rym: what do I need to do?

763
00:51:00,131 --> 00:51:05,864
Rym: Like in the NAS case, I want to back up all these PCs with tons of storage and your current NAS is full.

764
00:51:06,085 --> 00:51:07,150
Scott: Yep, and you got a problem.

765
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:13,430
Rym: Yep to something and I want that thing to back up to some other thing like Amazon Glacier.

766
00:51:14,231 --> 00:51:23,335
Rym: So that already is a more complex task than you might think because I'm not just saying here's the workflow I want but I'm also thinking about What could be it?

767
00:51:23,395 --> 00:51:26,045
Rym: What could I do with this workflow that I couldn't have done before?

768
00:51:26,406 --> 00:51:27,510
Rym: Is there something I'm missing?

769
00:51:27,932 --> 00:51:28,998
Rym: Is there an alternative solution?

770
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:32,612
Rym: is the thing I'm trying to accomplish even worth accomplishing Right.

771
00:51:32,632 --> 00:51:36,667
Scott: So for example, like I have a router my routers mad old and it's got some problems with it.

772
00:51:36,688 --> 00:51:37,290
Scott: It's not perfect.

773
00:51:37,410 --> 00:51:38,814
Scott: Yeah, right, but it works.

774
00:51:39,315 --> 00:51:40,318
Scott: everything connects to it.

775
00:51:40,739 --> 00:51:43,125
Scott: It you know, it does the DHCP just fine.

776
00:51:43,145 --> 00:51:44,809
Scott: It totally works, right?

777
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:51,768
Scott: But I've thought you know my new iPads my new iPhones they use like newer faster Wi-Fi.

778
00:51:51,829 --> 00:51:59,410
Scott: this router I have only does a BGN this new stuff like AC and even other 802 11's that I don't even know what they are now.

779
00:51:59,831 --> 00:52:07,230
Scott: Right, but I could get faster Wi-Fi with a newer router and get better features and such, you know, whatever right?

780
00:52:07,990 --> 00:52:10,285
Scott: Should I buy a new router when I have a perfectly working one?

781
00:52:10,325 --> 00:52:11,049
Scott: and I said, you know what?

782
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:19,890
Scott: You know while it's tempting to go around researching routers and you look at them and you want to buy stuff because you know Consumerism buying stuff is fun, right?

783
00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:26,129
Scott: You have to have the conscious brain that fights against that urge to buy stuff and spend money because it's like alright.

784
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:30,040
Scott: I imagine that I bought a new fancy router and that Wi-Fi was somehow faster.

785
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:31,765
Scott: How would my life be different?

786
00:52:32,527 --> 00:52:36,833
Scott: I would be poorer and Would I even notice?

787
00:52:37,174 --> 00:52:48,316
Scott: yep, like the speed of 802 11 and or whatever the hell I have now is already faster than the internet connection I get from the cable modem now, so An alternative discussion might be.

788
00:52:48,336 --> 00:52:52,386
Scott: so I never had a problem where my Wi-Fi wasn't fast enough for what I'm doing.

789
00:52:52,687 --> 00:53:03,400
Rym: say your router is marginal meaning it, you know, the speed isn't really a problem, but it occasionally needs to be rebooted because Overheating and you have a real problem.

790
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:04,225
Scott: your shits broken.

791
00:53:04,245 --> 00:53:05,070
Scott: you gotta replace it.

792
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:08,930
Rym: But then there's the question of do you replace it with the cheap thing that?

793
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:10,335
Rym: Accomplishes the same thing before?

794
00:53:10,355 --> 00:53:15,797
Rym: or do your future proof by spending the money because you got to buy one Anyway to buy a better one?

795
00:53:15,918 --> 00:53:20,374
Rym: right and that comes down to the thing we say all the time on GeekNights You got to identify.

796
00:53:20,836 --> 00:53:23,283
Rym: are you at a plateau of that technology?

797
00:53:23,344 --> 00:53:24,427
Scott: Yeah, so this happens.

798
00:53:25,069 --> 00:53:28,570
Scott: quite, you know When it actually comes to buying something there's usually three options, right?

799
00:53:28,910 --> 00:53:32,729
Scott: There's the bleeding edge latest and greatest expensive option.

800
00:53:33,271 --> 00:53:40,923
Scott: There is the very reasonable middle price option that it's pretty much like just great but not you know as amazing as the bleeding edge option.

801
00:53:41,366 --> 00:53:45,663
Scott: and there's the Really crazy value el cheapo option.

802
00:53:45,683 --> 00:53:48,997
Scott: that's not as good as the other two But damn you get a lot for your

803
00:53:49,098 --> 00:53:53,743
Rym: money like a one terabyte internal like cheapo West digital drive is 50 bucks

804
00:53:53,823 --> 00:53:56,255
Scott: right and it's like Shockingly cheap like

805
00:53:56,275 --> 00:53:57,899
Rym: any bucks for a terabyte

806
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:03,356
Scott: like wow this hard drive might crash, but holy crap That's a lot for 50 bucks.

807
00:54:03,436 --> 00:54:07,410
Rym: Like that's such a value except yet 90 bucks for four terabytes.

808
00:54:07,470 --> 00:54:08,214
Scott: Like there's no read.

809
00:54:08,255 --> 00:54:10,990
Scott: like they're cheaper things than this, but why would you go cheaper?

810
00:54:11,070 --> 00:54:13,058
Scott: This is the cheapest thing you would possibly buy.

811
00:54:13,078 --> 00:54:16,150
Rym: tried to sort by cheapness and it's showing me cables because right sort.

812
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:18,256
Scott: Well, so it's like how do you choose which?

813
00:54:18,297 --> 00:54:19,240
Rym: here you go Scott?

814
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:30,607
Rym: You can buy right now today a refurbished Seagate Barracuda 160 gigabyte drive for 10 bucks, but I mean like damn.

815
00:54:31,189 --> 00:54:37,602
Rym: yeah That is a piece of garbage $10 for a literal piece of god.

816
00:54:37,622 --> 00:54:38,769
Scott: Well, you bought ten of them.

817
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:42,093
Scott: Be 160 bucks.

818
00:54:42,113 --> 00:54:43,417
Scott: no 160 gigs for no.

819
00:54:43,438 --> 00:54:49,612
Scott: No 1600 $50 0.6 terabytes for $100.

820
00:54:49,612 --> 00:54:51,697
Scott: Is that a better deal than one terabyte for 50 bucks?

821
00:54:51,758 --> 00:54:51,858
Scott: Yeah.

822
00:54:51,878 --> 00:54:59,894
Scott: No, yeah anyway See like it's.

823
00:54:59,995 --> 00:55:06,538
Scott: oh it's always like a tough choice depending on what your situation is and it comes down to like How much you care right?

824
00:55:06,558 --> 00:55:08,768
Scott: So it's like for example, let's say you're buying.

825
00:55:08,929 --> 00:55:10,875
Scott: well You're buying a mouse.

826
00:55:10,895 --> 00:55:11,377
Rym: how much you care.

827
00:55:11,417 --> 00:55:13,162
Rym: but think how much you care now.

828
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:15,950
Rym: how much do you care about the situation?

829
00:55:16,990 --> 00:55:18,214
Rym: Three to five years from now?

830
00:55:19,057 --> 00:55:21,504
Rym: and what's the opportunity cost for today?

831
00:55:21,524 --> 00:55:21,645
Scott: Mm-hmm.

832
00:55:21,665 --> 00:55:23,250
Scott: It's like you're buying a mouse, right?

833
00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:30,830
Scott: Well, even if you're not if you're a pro gamer You should be buying the expensive mouse because that's a very important piece of equipment for your pro gaming needs.

834
00:55:31,191 --> 00:55:38,564
Scott: Right, if you're a gamer but not super pro You can definitely get away with the perfectly normal middle-of-the-road mouse.

835
00:55:38,644 --> 00:55:43,950
Scott: if you get the basic cheapo mouse You're gonna have problems even with your middle-of-the-road normal gamer ring, right?

836
00:55:44,670 --> 00:55:48,110
Scott: But if you're a normal person you get el cheapo mouse.

837
00:55:48,411 --> 00:55:54,750
Scott: But the thing with el cheapo mouse is even though it's an amazing mouse for five bucks is gonna break.

838
00:55:55,292 --> 00:55:58,442
Scott: It's like getting the $5 sunglasses or the $5 umbrella.

839
00:55:58,663 --> 00:56:00,690
Scott: You're gonna have to buy like ten of them, right?

840
00:56:00,791 --> 00:56:02,078
Scott: It's not gonna last that long.

841
00:56:02,098 --> 00:56:06,256
Scott: you're gonna be buying a mouse every year when like a Chip break, you know a piece of it breaks

842
00:56:06,276 --> 00:56:17,868
Rym: the old parable of it's it's it's more expensive to be poor because you have to buy stuff that costs too much for how durable it is and Then it wears out immediately because you can't afford to buy the one durable thing.

843
00:56:18,069 --> 00:56:28,170
Scott: Yep So, you know, that's you know It's like well if you need the mouse immediately and all you can afford is a cheap one get the cheap one Because it's still pretty great for that cheapo price.

844
00:56:28,411 --> 00:56:36,743
Scott: But if you can afford to go in middle-of-the-road then you should because then you're actually gonna be saving money possibly if Durability is your issue.

845
00:56:36,764 --> 00:56:47,146
Scott: Yeah, right But if the only if the durability of the cheaper one is fine And the only issue is like your DPI because it's a mouse and you're not gaming just get el cheapo mouse You'll never notice the difference in your whole life.

846
00:56:47,328 --> 00:56:51,669
Scott: Yep So buying a nice like I'll never notice the difference in that faster router in my whole life.

847
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:55,250
Rym: But it is already a pretty specialized use case.

848
00:56:55,290 --> 00:56:59,309
Rym: So assuming I know like you'd like I said, I got to work for like there's a thing I want to do.

849
00:56:59,932 --> 00:57:02,341
Rym: Having a modern as will solve that problem.

850
00:57:02,903 --> 00:57:08,216
Rym: It additionally solves all these other like Problems that weren't pressing.

851
00:57:08,316 --> 00:57:16,110
Rym: like there are features that will be nice for me that I didn't need But if they come along with the solution to a problem I have then that's great.

852
00:57:16,833 --> 00:57:28,779
Rym: So I'll get the NAS but they're gonna figure out what drives to buy and that was how I'd you know I went to Newegg and I literally just showed to show me hard drives bigger than four terabytes Just to see like what are the options?

853
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:29,663
Rym: What do things cost?

854
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:33,816
Rym: so I can begin to figure out like, okay There's this green one in this red one.

855
00:57:33,856 --> 00:57:35,361
Rym: What the hell's the difference between those?

856
00:57:35,641 --> 00:57:38,590
Rym: does the NAS drive really matter all that nonsense?

857
00:57:38,931 --> 00:57:39,755
Scott: So the way to figure it.

858
00:57:39,775 --> 00:57:40,659
Scott: so that's like I get.

859
00:57:40,699 --> 00:57:43,450
Scott: I said basically choose between the cheap middle and fancy option.

860
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:49,936
Scott: But when you go to Newegg or Amazon or wherever you're going to buy anything, there's not only three choices There's like a thousand choices.

861
00:57:49,977 --> 00:57:50,117
Rym: Yep.

862
00:57:50,338 --> 00:57:51,604
Scott: So how do you narrow it down?

863
00:57:51,644 --> 00:57:52,950
Scott: Here's how I narrow it down.

864
00:57:52,950 --> 00:57:56,230
Rym: All right, because I'll see how you if I do it different so they'll use your hard drives, right?

865
00:57:56,330 --> 00:58:01,090
Scott: So first of all, there's certain specs of the thing that you know are set in stone.

866
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:02,756
Rym: It's got to be at least four terabytes.

867
00:58:02,796 --> 00:58:04,382
Scott: It has to be a SATA drive.

868
00:58:04,443 --> 00:58:06,672
Scott: Yeah, it can't be an old IDE drive Right.

869
00:58:06,692 --> 00:58:07,378
Scott: So you lock in.

870
00:58:07,459 --> 00:58:08,790
Scott: it must be SATA drives, right?

871
00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:13,710
Scott: You look at like SATA and like well all the new modern SATA is like six gigabits per second.

872
00:58:13,770 --> 00:58:17,590
Scott: So you filter out all the old versions of SATA only the new versions, right?

873
00:58:18,197 --> 00:58:22,761
Scott: Then you say okay And I need at least this much space per drive.

874
00:58:22,902 --> 00:58:24,367
Scott: Yeah, you filter on storage.

875
00:58:24,428 --> 00:58:25,050
Scott: That's set in stone.

876
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:26,377
Scott: You can't change your mind about that.

877
00:58:26,417 --> 00:58:27,100
Scott: It needs to be at least.

878
00:58:27,643 --> 00:58:28,789
Scott: you said four terabytes.

879
00:58:28,849 --> 00:58:29,010
Scott: fine.

880
00:58:29,151 --> 00:58:31,161
Scott: All the ones smaller than four get out of my face.

881
00:58:31,302 --> 00:58:34,538
Rym: Yep, just broad brushes here All right, then you get your price in there.

882
00:58:34,578 --> 00:58:37,030
Scott: Well, obviously I don't even know point.

883
00:58:37,191 --> 00:58:42,210
Rym: Oh really because I want to know if there's an outlier either real high or real low.

884
00:58:42,774 --> 00:58:43,942
Rym: I want to know about it.

885
00:58:44,063 --> 00:58:49,504
Scott: at this initial stage I don't filter out low prices but I do filter out high prices because they like.

886
00:58:49,524 --> 00:58:53,218
Scott: if you're looking for video cards like Yeah, like there's always someone throwing in one.

887
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:56,308
Scott: That's like the Intel i9 whatever it's like that.

888
00:58:56,328 --> 00:58:57,512
Scott: I don't need that It's never.

889
00:58:57,592 --> 00:58:58,295
Rym: I do like to know.

890
00:58:58,315 --> 00:59:02,750
Scott: so I pick a very red like there's a point at which the price is ridiculous.

891
00:59:02,931 --> 00:59:03,513
Rym: Hi, okay.

892
00:59:03,533 --> 00:59:03,855
Rym: Okay.

893
00:59:03,875 --> 00:59:04,980
Rym: So you're do the thing I do.

894
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,808
Rym: I'll be like not more than two gray.

895
00:59:06,868 --> 00:59:08,339
Scott: Yeah, right It's like hard drives.

896
00:59:08,379 --> 00:59:12,499
Scott: It's like a four terabyte drive Not spending more than say $200 than one of those.

897
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:14,766
Scott: filter out everything that cost more than 300.

898
00:59:14,766 --> 00:59:24,369
Rym: Oh Our drive filter I specifically looked for under 500 because I wanted to see I would never even spend 400 on a drive.

899
00:59:24,991 --> 00:59:29,806
Rym: But if you want to look sure, but you know Well, I wanted to see what the what the because here's the thing.

900
00:59:29,826 --> 00:59:30,590
Rym: get back to the plateau.

901
00:59:31,272 --> 00:59:33,940
Rym: I want to know where the plateau is on drives.

902
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:41,464
Rym: in terms of like a six terabyte drive is Not that much cheaper than an eight terabyte so you should probably go for the eight terabyte.

903
00:59:41,705 --> 00:59:45,545
Rym: the ten terabyte is Significantly more expensive than the eight terabyte.

904
00:59:45,585 --> 00:59:58,004
Scott: to figure that out What I do is I sort by the low price and then I keep changing the storage requirement to look across right like that, but Like there's some like these are the specs that you care about?

905
00:59:58,044 --> 00:59:59,592
Scott: the price the story We're only.

906
00:59:59,692 --> 01:00:01,943
Scott: you know, this is only hard drives, but it applies to everything else.

907
01:00:01,963 --> 01:00:03,330
Scott: Let me talk about video cards, right?

908
01:00:03,656 --> 01:00:04,870
Scott: It's like, okay well

909
01:00:05,012 --> 01:00:05,417
Rym: I know

910
01:00:05,437 --> 01:00:16,890
Scott: that I'm either getting a 1070 or 1080 because 1060 and 1050 or two weeks for my awesome gaming PC and I know it's got to be PCI Express 16 and I know it's got to have two HDM eyes in the back and two display ports.

911
01:00:16,971 --> 01:00:20,191
Scott: Not one of those four display port ones because I'm plugging it into a TV you

912
01:00:20,211 --> 01:00:32,076
Rym: know, it's gotta be in video which actually we should talk about because we if you keep an eye on the trends of the thing you're researching you'll also be able to narrow it down by a Reasonable list of trusted brand.

913
01:00:32,136 --> 01:00:33,201
Scott: right you're buying a TV.

914
01:00:33,301 --> 01:00:33,582
Scott: Okay.

915
01:00:33,622 --> 01:00:35,610
Scott: Well, I know that you know, these brands are good.

916
01:00:35,651 --> 01:00:36,709
Scott: These brands are not good.

917
01:00:37,652 --> 01:00:44,550
Scott: I know that I need to have this many inputs on the bag like this the spec, you know I need this many inches for my room because my room is this big.

918
01:00:44,590 --> 01:00:45,373
Rym: Oh, these are.

919
01:00:45,413 --> 01:00:45,715
Scott: how do you?

920
01:00:45,755 --> 01:00:46,719
Rym: how do you figure out the brand like?

921
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:49,149
Rym: do you even look at AMD or like?

922
01:00:49,329 --> 01:00:49,490
Rym: do you?

923
01:00:49,590 --> 01:00:51,778
Rym: Look at ATI video cards or just do you not know?

924
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:52,381
Scott: Okay.

925
01:00:52,903 --> 01:00:53,666
Scott: I know not anymore.

926
01:00:53,686 --> 01:00:56,830
Scott: Yeah, I might though I am slightly paying attention to all the rising.

927
01:00:57,332 --> 01:01:03,090
Scott: You know biz and radion biz but it I haven't heard enough biz from there to convince me to look at them yet.

928
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:07,810
Rym: Well, like hard drives, I pretty much limited it to Western Digital and Seagate because all the other drives.

929
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:08,793
Scott: Oh, you look to brands.

930
01:01:09,094 --> 01:01:09,555
Scott: Okay.

931
01:01:09,576 --> 01:01:12,926
Scott: Well, so I don't like in the brand what I do.

932
01:01:12,946 --> 01:01:14,170
Scott: I eliminate brand.

933
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:16,139
Rym: I eliminate the Sorni's in the magnet box.

934
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:23,670
Scott: the final thing I do and you know There's not a hundred percent validity to this but I sort by review rate user review, right?

935
01:01:23,952 --> 01:01:24,778
Scott: It's like an Amazon.

936
01:01:24,819 --> 01:01:26,270
Scott: I look at the stars and a new egg.

937
01:01:26,310 --> 01:01:31,250
Scott: I look at the eggs and I go bring the highest average reviews by users to the top.

938
01:01:31,651 --> 01:01:33,982
Scott: Sometimes this will send you on a false errand.

939
01:01:34,284 --> 01:01:43,616
Scott: For example, they're You know, this a system is as rock right as rock is like the cheapo aces boards that motherboards they kind of work But you know, they're good.

940
01:01:43,676 --> 01:01:46,150
Scott: They're not the worst but they're cheapo aces boards.

941
01:01:46,753 --> 01:01:49,430
Scott: They give rebates to people who write new egg reviews.

942
01:01:49,751 --> 01:02:03,806
Scott: So if you sort motherboards by reviews as rocks show up first like almost all the time because and you'll see in the reviews people are like I'm writing this because of You know the rebate review program, but they're still leaving a positive review.

943
01:02:03,986 --> 01:02:05,190
Scott: They're honest reviews.

944
01:02:05,733 --> 01:02:08,329
Scott: I've seen people doing for the rebate review program with one egg.

945
01:02:08,972 --> 01:02:10,237
Rym: So I used to I don't like.

946
01:02:10,357 --> 01:02:13,670
Rym: this option seems to have disappeared for me on Amazon because I tried to do it earlier today.

947
01:02:13,991 --> 01:02:23,221
Rym: But I used to sort things not by highest average review, but by number of reviews Because on Amazon that would tell me what's the thing most people after.

948
01:02:23,341 --> 01:02:33,433
Scott: well, I mean after sorting by best, you know highest rating Yeah, you can look and say oh well That first one has like only five ratings and it's like they'll be one with perfect five stars But only five like

949
01:02:33,453 --> 01:02:34,477
Rym: when you buy the CPU and

950
01:02:34,537 --> 01:02:37,187
Scott: another one has like 2,000 ratings and is like 4.3 stars.

951
01:02:38,270 --> 01:02:41,423
Scott: It's like if you got thousands of ratings and you're still at 4.3 stars.

952
01:02:41,805 --> 01:02:43,110
Scott: that is might as well be five stars.

953
01:02:43,130 --> 01:02:52,130
Rym: Yes, but if you're buying like a CPU and you're a gamer You just look for what CPU from the current generation has the most reviews.

954
01:02:52,472 --> 01:02:56,570
Rym: It's probably the one that every gamer is buying and that's probably the one you want.

955
01:02:56,696 --> 01:02:57,615
Rym: Yeah And it's in.

956
01:02:57,716 --> 01:03:00,693
Rym: previously was that Intel like 6700 K I7.

957
01:03:00,813 --> 01:03:05,450
Scott: the other thing is when you look at the reviews every site has a little graph showing you how many fives how many fours?

958
01:03:05,590 --> 01:03:05,987
Scott: How many threes?

959
01:03:06,930 --> 01:03:11,730
Scott: Sometimes you'll see two different things and both are rated like four and a half stars or four and a half eggs.

960
01:03:12,113 --> 01:03:14,130
Scott: When you actually look at the reviews, right?

961
01:03:14,391 --> 01:03:19,650
Scott: What you're gonna see is that one of them is gonna have a huge pile of fives and a little bit of ones.

962
01:03:19,974 --> 01:03:20,883
Scott: That's bringing it down.

963
01:03:21,328 --> 01:03:24,506
Rym: Oh Read I actually read the text.

964
01:03:24,688 --> 01:03:24,950
Rym: I read

965
01:03:25,610 --> 01:03:43,170
Scott: Yeah, and then so and then you look at another one and another one maybe has like sort of a little curve to it like some five fours threes twos ones and that's what's bringing the average down from fives and what you realize is that The one with the curve is sort of like, you know sort of mixed reviews, right?

966
01:03:43,511 --> 01:03:49,153
Scott: But the one with a big spike on five and a little bit of a little bump on the ones That's just like.

967
01:03:49,213 --> 01:03:51,785
Scott: well, it's a product in the real world.

968
01:03:51,825 --> 01:03:56,345
Scott: There's a small percent chance You're gonna get a broken one, you know, so I do the same thing with restaurants.

969
01:03:56,365 --> 01:04:09,530
Rym: if I look at like Yelp or Google Yeah if I see a restaurant that has a bunch of like low ratings and I Read them and if the complaints are all about the service and not the food I almost definitely go to that restaurant because the people who complain about the service usually are bad people.

970
01:04:09,791 --> 01:04:13,790
Rym: Yep, especially if you read the text and it's clear that they're just a bad person.

971
01:04:14,232 --> 01:04:14,854
Rym: Same thing with this.

972
01:04:15,075 --> 01:04:20,189
Rym: if I see a review of a hard drive and it's like one star head to RMA It's like okay, dude.

973
01:04:20,771 --> 01:04:26,648
Scott: Yeah, it's like one star head to RMA but it's like yeah any any product on Newegg or anywhere is gonna be.

974
01:04:26,668 --> 01:04:29,398
Scott: you know Probably, you know, no one's perfect right.

975
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:31,367
Scott: even iPhones don't all show up 100% perfect.

976
01:04:32,230 --> 01:04:35,111
Scott: So people are buying, you know, the QA is not 100%.

977
01:04:35,111 --> 01:04:36,624
Scott: Someone's gonna buy an iPhone open it up.

978
01:04:36,665 --> 01:04:37,230
Scott: It's not gonna work.

979
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:39,510
Scott: They're gonna have to return it and get everyone one star iPhone.

980
01:04:40,236 --> 01:04:41,788
Scott: That doesn't mean iPhones are bad, right?

981
01:04:42,250 --> 01:04:47,730
Scott: But some you know, so if that's the old of all the one-star reviews are RMA's then all the rest are five.

982
01:04:47,971 --> 01:04:49,018
Scott: That's a perfect product.

983
01:04:49,078 --> 01:04:50,729
Scott: say something with a curve though.

984
01:04:51,151 --> 01:04:52,675
Scott: Fours and threes and twos.

985
01:04:52,715 --> 01:04:58,210
Scott: that's people who have a working thing and found some other problem with it where they kept it.

986
01:04:58,531 --> 01:05:04,510
Scott: But they have a complaint about it and that to me is actually worse than a review that says had to return it.

987
01:05:05,712 --> 01:05:08,925
Rym: So the NAS is the non plus versions that are like 200 bucks cheaper.

988
01:05:09,487 --> 01:05:10,250
Rym: they were like that.

989
01:05:10,310 --> 01:05:17,429
Rym: They had a lot of middling reviews that were like, yeah, it works fine But like if I runs this kind of service on it, it's actually kind of slow turns out.

990
01:05:17,770 --> 01:05:26,830
Rym: It doesn't have as much RAM as the more expensive version like those kinds of things That led me toward getting the more expensive one because those are the kinds of things that I would complain about.

991
01:05:27,111 --> 01:05:33,170
Scott: And so this is how by using the reviews and the filters you can figure out what is the cheap option?

992
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:42,410
Scott: That's like Wow inexpensive, but you get a lot for it Which one is the middling option where it's like that's the middle-of-the-road choice and which one is the bleeding edge.

993
01:05:42,591 --> 01:05:43,580
Scott: But it is the best.

994
01:05:43,681 --> 01:05:45,614
Scott: it just cost more money But I have money.

995
01:05:45,895 --> 01:05:52,030
Rym: and then the last thing I do is I try to narrow it down to like two case studies Like I could do it this way or this way.

996
01:05:52,090 --> 01:06:03,930
Scott: So like this NAS with this kind of drive this NAS with this kind of drive and imagine what your life is gonna be Like if you choose a or choose B and try to actually figure out like what's actually gonna be like when I use these.

997
01:06:04,452 --> 01:06:06,519
Scott: What's gonna be different for me in my life?

998
01:06:06,579 --> 01:06:08,245
Scott: What actual impact is it gonna have?

999
01:06:08,265 --> 01:06:10,914
Scott: Yeah is you know, okay Yeah, I'll buy the end.

1000
01:06:10,995 --> 01:06:12,620
Scott: I think about are you gonna buy Nvidia 1080 or a 1070?

1001
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:15,410
Scott: It's like or a 1060?

1002
01:06:15,410 --> 01:06:15,974
Scott: You think about it?

1003
01:06:16,034 --> 01:06:18,810
Scott: All right, if I buy a 1060 what will my life be like?

1004
01:06:18,930 --> 01:06:29,766
Scott: Well, you know what is gonna happen is I'm gonna buy some game on Steam like and it's it's gonna be a little slow Because you know the 1060 actually is quite significantly slower than the 1070 and a 1080 right?

1005
01:06:31,270 --> 01:06:37,430
Scott: Yeah, that video I render is gonna take like quite a while longer to render like maybe even hours, right?

1006
01:06:37,470 --> 01:06:39,097
Scott: I'm gonna lose time in my life for that 1060.

1007
01:06:39,097 --> 01:06:42,330
Scott: Is it worth $100 to go to the 1070?

1008
01:06:42,330 --> 01:06:45,930
Scott: It's like alright, I guess it is because that my life will be significantly better at 1070.

1009
01:06:45,930 --> 01:06:47,720
Scott: There wasn't instant 1070 1080.

1010
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:49,510
Rym: It's like a lot more money.

1011
01:06:49,792 --> 01:06:52,250
Scott: It is a lot more money and it is faster.

1012
01:06:52,390 --> 01:06:55,359
Scott: But you know what that game that was slow in the 1060 is.

1013
01:06:55,379 --> 01:07:01,550
Scott: it means like yeah the 1080 will get even more frames But the 1070 will still get enough frames, right?

1014
01:07:01,670 --> 01:07:02,754
Rym: So they did like the 1080.

1015
01:07:02,754 --> 01:07:06,566
Scott: I made this how much faster will my video render with a 1080 versus the 1070?

1016
01:07:06,566 --> 01:07:06,787
Scott: faster?

1017
01:07:08,031 --> 01:07:09,054
Scott: But how much faster?

1018
01:07:09,154 --> 01:07:11,741
Scott: only 30 minutes faster not hours faster.

1019
01:07:12,343 --> 01:07:14,770
Scott: All right, I can see where I should aim here.

1020
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:23,925
Rym: Yeah, and it comes down to once you narrow it down to like that level of granularity You're gonna make those tough calls like looking right here for hard drives for 90 bucks.

1021
01:07:23,965 --> 01:07:25,210
Rym: I get four terabyte drives.

1022
01:07:25,230 --> 01:07:25,912
Rym: Yeah, tough call.

1023
01:07:25,972 --> 01:07:32,798
Scott: maybe even though I know the 1060 is gonna not be as good as the 70 to a significant degree It's just so much cheaper.

1024
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:34,950
Scott: That money is gonna make a difference in my life.

1025
01:07:35,030 --> 01:07:36,778
Scott: What am I gonna spend that money on that?

1026
01:07:36,838 --> 01:07:37,481
Scott: I'm saving.

1027
01:07:37,662 --> 01:07:39,570
Scott: I'll have to pay that money that I'm saving.

1028
01:07:39,630 --> 01:07:45,790
Scott: I'm gonna buy this other thing and that is I'm basically paying an hour of video and coding time to get something else.

1029
01:07:46,415 --> 01:07:46,879
Rym: I'll do it.

1030
01:07:47,202 --> 01:07:55,690
Rym: So with the NAS I Would have to pay more than double to double the space like to go from four terabyte drives to eight terabyte drives.

1031
01:07:56,051 --> 01:07:59,123
Rym: It cost me more than double the money to do that.

1032
01:07:59,263 --> 01:07:59,444
Rym: Yep.

1033
01:07:59,644 --> 01:08:02,802
Rym: So what I imagined then was What is the pain?

1034
01:08:04,430 --> 01:08:05,394
Rym: That I'm dealing with now?

1035
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:08,906
Rym: the pain of dealing with now is fucking NAS is full and I want to do complicated stuff.

1036
01:08:09,007 --> 01:08:13,175
Rym: Mm-hmm double the space Greatly reduces the chance.

1037
01:08:13,235 --> 01:08:16,968
Rym: I'm gonna have to deal with the NAS is full in the next five years.

1038
01:08:17,189 --> 01:08:18,979
Rym: Yep I mean I am willing to pay.

1039
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,510
Scott: how long have I had my NAS?

1040
01:08:20,710 --> 01:08:21,171
Scott: It's never been.

1041
01:08:21,232 --> 01:08:24,990
Scott: it was only it was only full when Windows backup rotation was failing.

1042
01:08:25,051 --> 01:08:29,987
Scott: So I get a boat too many Windows backups Yeah, so I just deleted them all and now I haven't been out of space since.

1043
01:08:30,389 --> 01:08:32,948
Rym: yeah But my NAS only has two terabytes of space in it.

1044
01:08:33,210 --> 01:08:35,501
Scott: Oh my after redundant mine has I think four.

1045
01:08:35,622 --> 01:08:37,109
Scott: is it four twos or four fours?

1046
01:08:37,430 --> 01:08:39,519
Rym: That's two twos got about a long goddamn time ago.

1047
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:50,662
Rym: Yeah, so I looked at the space I'm using today and the panels and like I actually projected Storage requirements assuming that I do a full-on fucking backup pipeline.

1048
01:08:50,884 --> 01:08:58,341
Rym: because my other biggest fear is I do not want to buy a NAS and still have Manual backups in different places.

1049
01:08:58,783 --> 01:09:00,430
Rym: I want one ring to rule them all.

1050
01:09:00,731 --> 01:09:05,109
Rym: So paying more than double to go from fair type of terabyte drives to a terabyte drives was worth it.

1051
01:09:05,511 --> 01:09:11,310
Rym: I could not project a reasonable scenario where 10 or 12 terabyte drives would save me anything.

1052
01:09:11,371 --> 01:09:12,908
Rym: They would just cost me a ton of money.

1053
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:21,350
Rym: Plus that NAS you can buy up to two Additional units that plug into it that can each hold five more drives.

1054
01:09:23,395 --> 01:09:24,587
Rym: So I can upgrade it.

1055
01:09:25,432 --> 01:09:30,350
Rym: So I could buy three years from now five twelve terabyte drives and shove them in there.

1056
01:09:30,390 --> 01:09:32,660
Scott: Well, assuming they're still selling that attachment thing.

1057
01:09:32,921 --> 01:09:34,689
Rym: Yeah, but QNAP seems okay about that.

1058
01:09:34,930 --> 01:09:35,232
Rym: We'll see.

1059
01:09:35,473 --> 01:09:39,109
Rym: I see a lot of reviews about people who've had these things longer not QNAP Synology.

1060
01:09:39,130 --> 01:09:40,228
Rym: QNAP was the one that looked bad.

1061
01:09:41,671 --> 01:09:43,317
Scott: So, yeah Synology does look better.

1062
01:09:43,558 --> 01:09:52,470
Scott: you get the feeling from you know, that's one thing you had to do especially with Brands, it's sort of get a feel for like what you know, it's like brands don't mean nothing.

1063
01:09:52,912 --> 01:09:56,970
Scott: It's like the brand itself is just a marketing logo symbol, whatever, right?

1064
01:09:57,250 --> 01:09:58,335
Scott: But you get a feel for like.

1065
01:09:58,395 --> 01:09:59,440
Scott: what is the company like?

1066
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:01,770
Scott: and I get a feel from Synology looking at their software.

1067
01:10:01,810 --> 01:10:11,766
Rym: It's a bunch of open source Linux nerds working there Because basically their client base includes like offices and companies not just like me.

1068
01:10:11,786 --> 01:10:15,812
Rym: Yeah in my house Yeah And.

1069
01:10:15,973 --> 01:10:19,110
Rym: but then I went to like QNAP site and it didn't look as polished.

1070
01:10:19,551 --> 01:10:22,542
Rym: So, of course that could be dangerous like don't go to aces website.

1071
01:10:22,562 --> 01:10:24,167
Rym: You'll never fucking buy an aces thing again.

1072
01:10:24,508 --> 01:10:24,910
Scott: That's right.

1073
01:10:26,451 --> 01:10:31,530
Rym: So yeah, just know what know what you want to do first and everything else follows from there.

1074
01:10:31,772 --> 01:10:33,845
Rym: And if you don't know what you want to do, don't do nothing.

1075
01:10:33,905 --> 01:10:34,610
Rym: Don't buy anything.

1076
01:10:36,815 --> 01:10:37,597
Scott: Don't buy stuff.

1077
01:10:37,617 --> 01:10:39,764
Scott: just cuz you like buying stuff unless you mad rich.

1078
01:10:39,804 --> 01:10:43,378
