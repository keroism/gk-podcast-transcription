1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,840
Rym: It's Tuesday August 15th 2017.

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,350
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights side.

3
00:00:15,652 --> 00:00:18,669
Rym: We're talking about Namco museum on the Nintendo switch.

4
00:00:20,032 --> 00:00:22,753
Rym: Let's do this This past weekend.

5
00:00:22,774 --> 00:00:29,090
Rym: We spent probably our last summer beach day because Pax is coming real soon, and it's also cold and rainy.

6
00:00:29,712 --> 00:00:30,896
Rym: Yeah, it's like there was.

7
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:34,990
Rym: basically we had this window of one day where we could go to the beach in a while.

8
00:00:35,071 --> 00:00:40,920
Rym: Just because weekends have been busy And it's actually been not the best beach weather We stayed on that beach as long as we possibly could.

9
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,010
Scott: we got back to that ferry as it was pulling.

10
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,039
Rym: Yeah, you guys like roll it.

11
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:47,289
Rym: cuz we rolled up ahead to throw away all our stuff in the dumpster.

12
00:00:47,611 --> 00:00:49,642
Scott: I would have made it sooner, but someone was slow.

13
00:00:49,662 --> 00:00:52,979
Scott: Yeah, but that happens We could have left early.

14
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,470
Rym: Yeah, we could have but we were on the beach.

15
00:00:54,510 --> 00:01:02,549
Rym: If no one wanted to leave the beach you couldn't wait for the next ferry - yeah We are already like we packed up already unbeached.

16
00:01:02,972 --> 00:01:04,664
Rym: If you're gonna let's stay for the second ferry.

17
00:01:04,684 --> 00:01:05,570
Rym: cuz that's two more hours.

18
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,941
Rym: You've got a commit to staying at the beach that two extra hours.

19
00:01:09,082 --> 00:01:09,323
Rym: Otherwise.

20
00:01:09,343 --> 00:01:10,346
Rym: There's no point plus.

21
00:01:10,406 --> 00:01:11,249
Scott: Oh, I need to go home.

22
00:01:11,691 --> 00:01:13,663
Rym: Yeah, cuz I got stuff to do for packs.

23
00:01:13,764 --> 00:01:14,830
Scott: I still haven't even done laundry.

24
00:01:15,573 --> 00:01:16,798
Rym: I did a big loader yesterday.

25
00:01:16,818 --> 00:01:19,930
Scott: cuz the way to clean my kitchen and living room, but the bedroom is a problem.

26
00:01:20,352 --> 00:01:28,424
Rym: I can do laundry pretty well while I play Civ 6. and so my first news Civ 6 if you weren't paying attention got a big update.

27
00:01:28,725 --> 00:01:30,190
Scott: Oh, some people are playing that game still.

28
00:01:30,352 --> 00:01:33,373
Rym: yeah, so I played it again and It's hard though.

29
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:37,330
Rym: So I didn't fully read the release notes because I didn't realize there was a patch.

30
00:01:37,651 --> 00:01:43,223
Rym: I just started playing Civ 6 kind of out of nowhere because the Civ 5 games that I'm playing with the patrons are going pretty well.

31
00:01:44,592 --> 00:01:47,144
Rym: The Civ 5 game I'm playing with our friends is not going well.

32
00:01:47,445 --> 00:01:48,410
Rym: You are all monsters.

33
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,014
Scott: Yeah, get them.

34
00:01:50,716 --> 00:01:52,864
Rym: the entire world is ganged up on me.

35
00:01:52,924 --> 00:01:54,088
Scott: All right, listen to Scott.

36
00:01:54,148 --> 00:02:05,570
Rym: finally Jesus Christ all of the world Jesus versus tiny Peaceful enlightened Portugal Just wants evil Rym going down.

37
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:13,810
Scott: It's only the real world would unite against evil the same way that that great world of civilization has united against evil.

38
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:21,105
Rym: Portugal Rym to go never at once violated a treaty in good faith.

39
00:02:21,406 --> 00:02:22,830
Rym: did not invade Germany on.

40
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,963
Scott: We're like victory-seeking.

41
00:02:25,983 --> 00:02:27,550
Rym: I attack our hungry.

42
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:35,605
Rym: The true danger the menace on the eastern horizon Western horizon the menace of Ethiopia and Lisa.

43
00:02:35,766 --> 00:02:36,509
Scott: good job people.

44
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:40,730
Scott: now Nobody turned your back on the rest of the United World, right?

45
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:49,490
Scott: You need to remain united until the threat of Rym to go has been 100% completely Just like the threat of scotch a goal was annihilated.

46
00:02:50,472 --> 00:02:54,490
Rym: Only hope grasp my mummified heart and understand the true danger.

47
00:02:54,651 --> 00:02:59,050
Rym: If you don't unite with me now in my great ordeal to destroy Ethiopia y'all are fucked.

48
00:03:00,132 --> 00:03:01,941
Scott: You can get Ethiopia after Rym is dead.

49
00:03:02,142 --> 00:03:06,198
Rym: No, if you know if you wait too long It's it's a lost cause because Ethiopia is equal.

50
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:11,896
Rym: if not actually if Ethiopia fully uses her continent Ethiopia is undefeatable.

51
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:12,257
Rym: You know what?

52
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:12,879
Scott: that's fine.

53
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,688
Scott: Cuz at Rym doesn't win as long as Rym doesn't win.

54
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:16,170
Scott: It's okay.

55
00:03:16,712 --> 00:03:20,430
Rym: I just want to point out that you got rolled by the AI and Lisa like right away.

56
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:23,810
Scott: I don't know how to play sieve too many stuff in sieve.

57
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,170
Scott: They got to simplify an abstract.

58
00:03:25,251 --> 00:03:35,098
Rym: But it's easy to forget how long ago Because I started upload I over to the first video of like turn hundred when James was still in the game in England How thoroughly I rolled him.

59
00:03:35,118 --> 00:03:38,610
Rym: and I would just point out as much as you might say I'm evil.

60
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,379
Rym: No one could blame me for invading England.

61
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,603
Rym: You would have done it.

62
00:03:43,105 --> 00:03:44,028
Rym: Anyone would have done it.

63
00:03:44,188 --> 00:03:45,593
Scott: I don't invade I just build.

64
00:03:45,714 --> 00:03:46,497
Scott: I just build stuff.

65
00:03:46,577 --> 00:03:56,407
Rym: Scott if your neighbor had three nice cities One composite Archer and the great library and nothing else not even walls.

66
00:03:56,447 --> 00:03:56,989
Rym: What would you do?

67
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:58,736
Scott: I keep.

68
00:03:58,796 --> 00:04:00,890
Scott: I just like happily peacefully building my shit.

69
00:04:01,131 --> 00:04:01,713
Rym: Why not just have?

70
00:04:01,753 --> 00:04:08,885
Scott: it was a no war version of sieve where everyone just could only build settlers and workers And buildings and you couldn't build any military units.

71
00:04:08,985 --> 00:04:09,850
Scott: That would be the best game.

72
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:11,964
Rym: That's just playing Sim City next to other people.

73
00:04:11,984 --> 00:04:19,103
Rym: I know Yeah But so I started playing Civ 6 just like for a few hours not a warlike person.

74
00:04:19,505 --> 00:04:21,050
Scott: I am NOT evil like Rym to go.

75
00:04:21,151 --> 00:04:21,779
Rym: I'm not evil.

76
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:26,641
Rym: I'm simply Appropriately bellicose to the time and circumstance of my civilization is back.

77
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:27,543
Scott: Is it portrait Rym?

78
00:04:28,025 --> 00:04:28,867
Rym: Yeah, I think it.

79
00:04:28,887 --> 00:04:29,650
Rym: Rym to go is better.

80
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:34,822
Rym: But I started playing Civ 6 and it just felt better.

81
00:04:34,902 --> 00:04:42,230
Rym: like I. all I could think to myself was wow I remember being pretty harsh on this UX and UI but it's actually feeling pretty good.

82
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:42,852
Rym: Maybe I was?

83
00:04:43,113 --> 00:04:45,461
Rym: no they actually changed it and I just didn't notice.

84
00:04:45,762 --> 00:04:55,190
Rym: this patch that came out recently Actually made a lot of subtle changes that combined just make the game feel so much better.

85
00:04:55,912 --> 00:04:59,100
Rym: The notifications are way more apt so you don't miss stuff.

86
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,007
Rym: The game just feels like really right that kind of thing.

87
00:05:02,488 --> 00:05:06,610
Scott: Yeah Like the game just tells you it's like I want to play it.

88
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:11,615
Scott: But the problem is I want to play all the games and I only have time for so many games Time for other stuff.

89
00:05:11,655 --> 00:05:13,040
Scott: I want to do this not games.

90
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:17,015
Scott: and then it's like how can I invest in a game that takes like Half a day to play.

91
00:05:17,035 --> 00:05:18,441
Rym: Yeah, but it was so fun.

92
00:05:18,481 --> 00:05:19,747
Rym: Like I got into that city.

93
00:05:19,767 --> 00:05:20,450
Scott: so fun.

94
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,623
Scott: But it's like there are also other things that are so fun.

95
00:05:23,663 --> 00:05:25,390
Rym: How do I choose if I didn't have a job?

96
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,169
Rym: I probably pay place if a lot more.

97
00:05:27,951 --> 00:05:32,090
Scott: Yeah, if I didn't have a job I could do all the things I want to do and the job takes 40.

98
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:36,063
Scott: I probably get a majority of my waking hours every week are spent at job.

99
00:05:36,504 --> 00:05:40,710
Scott: So doing this one stupid thing I just want to sit when I could be doing many great things.

100
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:47,470
Rym: I want to sit on a beach with a surface book Just playing save and every now and then saving my game and going swimming.

101
00:05:48,353 --> 00:05:50,350
Rym: But yeah, so you can read the change notes.

102
00:05:50,430 --> 00:06:03,562
Rym: But they made a ton of changes and most of them are actually really minor balance changes to individual saves and they added new saves like Aqueducts are 30% cheaper and sewers are 50% cheaper.

103
00:06:03,943 --> 00:06:08,259
Rym: districts as a whole or 10% cheaper Like they just made the game.

104
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,150
Scott: cheaper is good because you can do more stuff.

105
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:18,246
Rym: It's more cuz it felt it always felt like it took too long to build takes too long to build everything But they calm that down like military units would take like a couple turns and anything.

106
00:06:18,286 --> 00:06:19,390
Scott: I didn't like building military.

107
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,319
Scott: I like building buildings and they take for a fucking ever.

108
00:06:21,621 --> 00:06:23,430
Rym: They also fixed a lot of stuff with the AI.

109
00:06:23,672 --> 00:06:36,309
Rym: So if you're gonna win the game Even if the AI is like by its rules super friendly because you've been super friendly to it It'll get increasingly aggressive if you're actually on track to win, which is probably good.

110
00:06:38,072 --> 00:06:42,147
Rym: I feel like our eyes our human eye friends and that's if game should not have done this.

111
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:47,810
Rym: and again If you guys you're all evil and I hope you burn in hell once Ethiopia destroys you after you invade me.

112
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:48,641
Rym: But I digress.

113
00:06:48,905 --> 00:06:54,830
Rym: that's fine But like the combat preview just like works way better.

114
00:06:54,910 --> 00:07:03,744
Rym: So like, you know A unit that you gave a long set of orders to like ten turns of moving.

115
00:07:03,764 --> 00:07:06,995
Rym: if you hover over it It'll show you what it's gonna do.

116
00:07:07,737 --> 00:07:11,670
Rym: all these little things added up to where the game is just way more pleasant to play.

117
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:18,190
Scott: Well, these are all things that you know are a symptom of games, you know getting released before they're super super super polished.

118
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:21,727
Rym: Yeah in the old days These are the things that you had doing like the last six months of.

119
00:07:21,748 --> 00:07:21,969
Rym: you know.

120
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:26,586
Scott: Other people are releasing their games and calling it early access and some people aren't.

121
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:29,538
Scott: but when sim six is released It was basically, you know, what was the difference?

122
00:07:29,559 --> 00:07:30,885
Scott: because they didn't call it early access.

123
00:07:30,945 --> 00:07:31,870
Scott: It counts as released.

124
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,282
Scott: It's like it's just names for the same thing.

125
00:07:34,302 --> 00:07:35,910
Scott: Yep, you know, whatever.

126
00:07:36,484 --> 00:07:36,730
Rym: But yeah.

127
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:38,799
Rym: so if you Mables mean nothing.

128
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:47,943
Rym: if you haven't played civ6 in a while right about now is a good time to just poke at it because you might find it a lot more pleasant or Wait a little bit longer and maybe it'll be even cheaper.

129
00:07:47,984 --> 00:07:49,250
Scott: a nice bundle occlude everything.

130
00:07:49,691 --> 00:07:51,597
Rym: I just buy Civ games when they come out.

131
00:07:51,678 --> 00:07:55,570
Scott: I can yeah, I bought every sieve when it came out since sieve three.

132
00:07:56,193 --> 00:08:02,103
Rym: Yeah, I pirated sieve - because back then I didn't really understand Siva - I'm sim - I bought but I didn't get it.

133
00:08:02,283 --> 00:08:05,235
Scott: as soon as it was released It was like I went to copy us a

134
00:08:05,275 --> 00:08:13,953
Rym: friend of my parents like this like this other dad literally just like gave us a CD That I'd save on it and he was just like hey install this on your computer It's pretty good

135
00:08:13,973 --> 00:08:15,662
Scott: a CD with the real book and everything.

136
00:08:15,843 --> 00:08:16,286
Rym: Yeah, I never.

137
00:08:16,346 --> 00:08:17,070
Rym: I never had the book.

138
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:18,436
Rym: I just look like xcom.

139
00:08:18,858 --> 00:08:20,345
Rym: I just learned the game from trial and error.

140
00:08:20,365 --> 00:08:21,409
Rym: I never saw an instruction book.

141
00:08:22,492 --> 00:08:22,794
Scott: I saw.

142
00:08:22,874 --> 00:08:25,650
Scott: the only way time I saw the xcom instruction book is the PDF on Steam.

143
00:08:26,303 --> 00:08:29,882
Rym: Oh, yeah I never saw it as a kid and I never heard the sound.

144
00:08:29,923 --> 00:08:33,397
Scott: yeah pro tip if you got games on Steam They do have instruction manuals.

145
00:08:33,437 --> 00:08:34,201
Scott: They're on Steam.

146
00:08:34,241 --> 00:08:40,607
Scott: you go to the Steam page and on the right side There's all these links that have tons of info including like soundtracks PDFs, etc, etc.

147
00:08:41,571 --> 00:08:42,635
Scott: And it's it's not.

148
00:08:42,676 --> 00:08:45,650
Scott: it's somewhat not super obvious, but they're all there.

149
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:48,023
Scott: You should check them out especially for old games.

150
00:08:48,224 --> 00:09:00,832
Scott: in related news There are civilization board games off and on but there is a well There's a lot of games that are like they're effectively sieve the board game like through the ages Yeah, and then there's a lot of games that are actually branded Civilization.

151
00:09:00,852 --> 00:09:02,296
Scott: there's a few of those full disclosure.

152
00:09:02,457 --> 00:09:04,283
Rym: I have never liked any of these games.

153
00:09:04,985 --> 00:09:06,470
Rym: I've never enjoyed them.

154
00:09:06,651 --> 00:09:13,170
Rym: I like through the ages, but no I'm gonna use the word that Luke crane I think it might be is one of his most hated words on earth, but they're too fiddly.

155
00:09:14,311 --> 00:09:14,954
Rym: They don't buy.

156
00:09:15,074 --> 00:09:18,950
Scott: actual sieve isn't too fiddly which even though it's way more for actual save is way more fiddly.

157
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:23,530
Rym: But most of the fiddling is semi-automated or fully automated by the game.

158
00:09:24,353 --> 00:09:25,417
Scott: You still have to think about it.

159
00:09:25,758 --> 00:09:27,946
Scott: Yeah in this you have to think about a lot less cuz.

160
00:09:27,966 --> 00:09:28,508
Scott: this you know.

161
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:34,430
Rym: yeah But I don't want to play a card that says and I quote move even to each of your caravans up to four spaces.

162
00:09:34,772 --> 00:09:38,170
Rym: They can move into spaces matching this slots terrain or lower.

163
00:09:38,571 --> 00:09:40,697
Rym: Your caravans can move into barbarian spaces.

164
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:45,190
Rym: if you move over a caravan in barbarian space defeat that barbarian without gaining a trade token.

165
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:45,571
Scott: Right.

166
00:09:45,591 --> 00:09:45,911
Scott: so this?

167
00:09:46,011 --> 00:09:48,035
Rym: I do not want to parse all that text.

168
00:09:48,435 --> 00:09:54,542
Scott: That's because this particular civilization game is Published by fantasy flight, and this is a kind of crap.

169
00:09:54,602 --> 00:09:55,044
Scott: Oh game.

170
00:09:55,064 --> 00:09:55,767
Scott: They make it's.

171
00:09:55,907 --> 00:10:01,938
Scott: you could tell it's a Literally pictures of art from the game Fantasy flight game.

172
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:05,210
Rym: right away you see this on a table, and you're like that's fantasy flight.

173
00:10:05,331 --> 00:10:10,518
Rym: Yeah, or someone's ripping off fantasy flights is no they're publishing it So you can skip this one.

174
00:10:10,619 --> 00:10:20,671
Rym: probably look at all these pieces to prove It's good, but this game on my prediction is the game has a lot of complexity that does not translate into a lot of strategic Thinking.

175
00:10:20,691 --> 00:10:25,419
Rym: no and there will be numerous rules parsing issues.

176
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,010
Rym: Oh, yeah No, yeah, it appears to be multiplayer like four sieves.

177
00:10:30,734 --> 00:10:31,258
Rym: I just can't.

178
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,133
Rym: if you want to play a game play eclipse No, or dope.

179
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:37,402
Rym: if you want to play a game that gives the feels of sieve play tempest.

180
00:10:38,043 --> 00:10:42,080
Scott: mmm temp actually actually abstracts Eclipse.

181
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,570
Rym: yeah, you keep every turn.

182
00:10:43,671 --> 00:10:44,278
Rym: What do you want to do?

183
00:10:44,521 --> 00:10:45,269
Rym: walk around?

184
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:48,683
Rym: Sit and think make some babies fight with somebody.

185
00:10:48,723 --> 00:10:50,370
Rym: build a city like that's your options.

186
00:10:50,771 --> 00:10:52,035
Scott: Make babies every turn.

187
00:10:52,256 --> 00:10:55,166
Rym: make babies every turn is not the worst strategy sometimes.

188
00:10:55,206 --> 00:10:56,430
Rym: That's my real-life strategy.

189
00:10:59,828 --> 00:11:00,754
Rym: Oh yeah, people are.

190
00:11:01,015 --> 00:11:08,148
Rym: people are talking about how this is basically a port of sieve six and Not feeling this at all the more I look at it

191
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:18,883
Scott: You know just because it had people get in this trap where because something has an intellectual property license that is associated with some sort Of goodness well that like they had that they suddenly now you're paying attention with.

192
00:11:19,044 --> 00:11:22,524
Scott: if that board game didn't have a sieve license It wouldn't even be on your radar.

193
00:11:22,544 --> 00:11:24,233
Scott: You wouldn't know it existed You never talked about it.

194
00:11:24,273 --> 00:11:31,056
Scott: that just because it has this license and intellectual property trademark on it suddenly It becomes news on GeekNights.

195
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,344
Scott: right you have to escape this idea.

196
00:11:33,364 --> 00:11:36,808
Scott: right stop paying attention to things Just because there's some license attached to it.

197
00:11:36,869 --> 00:11:37,906
Rym: well I mean remember the.

198
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:47,276
Scott: It's like some crapo dice game, and they put a picture Luke Skywalker on it and suddenly whoa Everybody remember those adventure time games.

199
00:11:47,357 --> 00:11:48,982
Rym: because on the done that what the DS.

200
00:11:49,102 --> 00:11:50,086
Scott: Yeah, that's a perfect is.

201
00:11:50,146 --> 00:11:52,973
Rym: those games were Garbage weren't?

202
00:11:52,993 --> 00:11:54,116
Rym: the more I think about him.

203
00:11:54,176 --> 00:11:55,881
Rym: like they're they're bad.

204
00:11:56,182 --> 00:12:00,296
Rym: They're worse than some of the games in the Namco Museum We're about to talk about like.

205
00:12:00,316 --> 00:12:03,206
Rym: they're the worst and even worse.

206
00:12:03,527 --> 00:12:10,370
Scott: those games It's like a platform or someone made in a weekend like the first level of those games seems like okay.

207
00:12:10,651 --> 00:12:17,170
Rym: This is like this could become a decent game if I keep playing it and then everything after the first level is just increasingly garbage.

208
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:24,690
Rym: So yeah, I would skip this game unless the reviews are somehow really good from people like us.

209
00:12:25,972 --> 00:12:27,842
Rym: If we come back and say this game is good.

210
00:12:27,902 --> 00:12:32,035
Scott: I guarantee it's good It's got a lot to prove.

211
00:12:32,256 --> 00:12:35,590
Rym: yeah, if we don't come back and if we never talk about this game again never buy this game.

212
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:38,516
Rym: So uh how about that dota bot?

213
00:12:38,997 --> 00:12:41,103
Scott: yeah, so the dota international?

214
00:12:41,244 --> 00:12:46,578
Scott: What seven I think was the seventh one I don't know a team liquid one, which I guess yay.

215
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:47,220
Scott: They're cool.

216
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:50,970
Rym: Whatever I hear their name enough to where I recognize them.

217
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:53,355
Scott: Yeah, there's a guy who's on team liquid.

218
00:12:53,375 --> 00:13:02,456
Scott: I watch play Hearthstone all the time this Finnish dude and He the thing is he doesn't seem to compete in eSports very much But he has like a team liquid chair, and he's on the team, and he makes.

219
00:13:02,597 --> 00:13:03,160
Scott: he sells.

220
00:13:03,602 --> 00:13:07,799
Scott: You know he makes money and whatnot, but he doesn't do any eSports, so I'm like how does that work?

221
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,029
Scott: Imagine if I was only the New York Rangers, but I didn't like he.

222
00:13:11,069 --> 00:13:20,365
Scott: I just sat around at home and made hockey streams All day, but I wasn't actually in the NHL or any league not even a minor league Somehow like get it.

223
00:13:20,445 --> 00:13:21,228
Scott: I got a jersey.

224
00:13:21,248 --> 00:13:21,971
Scott: people buy it.

225
00:13:22,091 --> 00:13:23,617
Scott: I'm it's so weird right.

226
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:30,924
Scott: I don't know how that works But anyway One of the things that they do you know they don't just have the tournament there They have other events there.

227
00:13:30,964 --> 00:13:37,245
Scott: and one of the things they had was they had this AI bot set up and the bot Was very limited right.

228
00:13:37,325 --> 00:13:40,735
Scott: it played only one hero and all it did was solo mid.

229
00:13:41,236 --> 00:13:46,768
Scott: and they were like if you can beat this bot Then you can you know you get a prize or whatever.

230
00:13:46,888 --> 00:13:53,480
Scott: and there were some pro players who basically got destroyed by this bot Because they played it at its own game.

231
00:13:53,581 --> 00:13:58,820
Scott: They went into the middle And they did the things that it had been trained to beat which you know go to the middle and fight.

232
00:13:59,321 --> 00:14:07,413
Scott: But people quickly figured out after a little bit of practice like oh this bot is really honed in on doing this one thing It can't really do anything else.

233
00:14:07,735 --> 00:14:12,540
Scott: if you do this You'll confuse the hell out of it, and then you can sort of just win and get the prize.

234
00:14:13,021 --> 00:14:18,860
Rym: So everyone collected the prize on yeah, but before anyone says yeah, the MOBAs are so complicated.

235
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,640
Rym: This is why bots will never be good at it.

236
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:30,793
Rym: I want to remind you that it wasn't that long ago when there is that AI that could beat people at poker But it can only beat people at like two-player limit poker.

237
00:14:31,395 --> 00:14:37,847
Rym: and people were like yeah, Texas Hold'em No limit is so different, and then the bots were like yeah, no fuck you humans They'll never be good at poker again.

238
00:14:37,948 --> 00:14:39,919
Rym: ever like that happens so quick.

239
00:14:40,642 --> 00:14:47,120
Rym: Same thing's gonna happen here because the problem with MOBAs is that bots are almost like wait isn't there still online poker for real money?

240
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:48,304
Scott: Still a thing.

241
00:14:48,324 --> 00:14:52,480
Rym: yeah, I'm pretty sure a eyes are just going to ruin that space real quick.

242
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:59,180
Scott: But why can't I shouldn't I just do that right as soon as I get home get the best poker AI and just Hook it up to the online poker?

243
00:14:59,341 --> 00:15:02,980
Scott: I don't know like a hundred bucks in there and then come home to like a million bucks.

244
00:15:03,322 --> 00:15:07,503
Rym: I don't know all the details, but it's this team at CMU is the article I remember.

245
00:15:07,523 --> 00:15:10,900
Scott: give me why are they using their code to make free money with online folks?

246
00:15:11,101 --> 00:15:12,570
Rym: I assume they are because.

247
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:14,058
Rym: otherwise why would you make a poker AI?

248
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:23,194
Scott: Give me I can run it on a computer - why don't I deserve free tell you what guys.

249
00:15:23,234 --> 00:15:24,921
Rym: I'll pay for the Amazon server to run It.

250
00:15:25,202 --> 00:15:26,126
Scott: I'll pay for whatever.

251
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:26,528
Scott: It's all.

252
00:15:26,648 --> 00:15:29,139
Scott: I'll give the initial bidding money and the run the server.

253
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:37,408
Rym: I'll just take my portion of the free money I think is if I were them I'd run the bar for a while And I would sell the bot to everybody at the same time.

254
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:41,198
Scott: yeah, but and everyone's running the bot yeah, and then what?

255
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,034
Scott: well It should run the bot against itself and see what.

256
00:15:44,095 --> 00:15:46,663
Rym: how it does I Guess theoretically.

257
00:15:46,744 --> 00:15:56,428
Rym: theoretically if there were any come down to luck of which has the best car in a game that had perfect Perfect AI that was optimal and perfect.

258
00:15:56,468 --> 00:16:03,457
Rym: and let's skip all the like game theory ramifications of that and the the impossibilities of you Know deterministic world yeah, it would just be random at that point.

259
00:16:03,477 --> 00:16:06,326
Scott: hmm Then I could just put money in a slot machine.

260
00:16:06,346 --> 00:16:07,671
Rym: Yeah, yeah slot machine.

261
00:16:08,012 --> 00:16:08,494
Scott: What have we made?

262
00:16:08,514 --> 00:16:10,120
Scott: a slot machine that paid out fairly?

263
00:16:11,046 --> 00:16:11,780
Rym: What do you mean fairly?

264
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:20,980
Scott: Well because like a slot machine is programmed in such a way to pay out such that no matter how much even if you get Lucky, you're not gonna make more money than you put in over time.

265
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:27,191
Scott: No, we can make a slot machine that pays out even money over time Instead of always my house winning over time.

266
00:16:27,211 --> 00:16:28,880
Rym: Why would I ever have that slot machine?

267
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,283
Scott: It'll be fun.

268
00:16:30,887 --> 00:16:31,873
Rym: Yeah, I mean I guess we could.

269
00:16:31,893 --> 00:16:36,539
Rym: just I could have one in my house mmm, but I probably just rig it cuz.

270
00:16:38,121 --> 00:16:38,422
Rym: But yeah.

271
00:16:38,602 --> 00:16:47,252
Rym: so with MOBAs the skill that is primarily being tested in MOBAs is not the Overall strategy of what your team is gonna.

272
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:52,170
Scott: There's a lot of different skills on it Yeah, but a multi it's a multidisciplinary game.

273
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:55,420
Rym: well as we saw this bot is really good at like the close-in tactic.

274
00:16:55,601 --> 00:16:59,116
Rym: So have a widely different strategy, and it just flails.

275
00:16:59,136 --> 00:16:59,839
Rym: doesn't know what to do.

276
00:17:00,362 --> 00:17:03,178
Scott: It hasn't been trained yet, though eventually it'll be trained to do everything.

277
00:17:03,379 --> 00:17:05,858
Scott: yeah To buy items at the item shop.

278
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,825
Scott: I don't think it knows how to you know.

279
00:17:07,886 --> 00:17:12,880
Rym: change the parts of dough of MOBAs that are the hardest for humans to deal with.

280
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,220
Rym: Are the things that bots can do trivial?

281
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,125
Scott: That's the things.

282
00:17:16,226 --> 00:17:16,648
Rym: perfect.

283
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:20,686
Rym: last hitting no matter what Frame perfect input on any attack.

284
00:17:20,928 --> 00:17:27,066
Rym: if you're gonna gank and you use a power and you get frame perfect the last Pixel of your range get someone.

285
00:17:27,426 --> 00:17:34,440
Rym: that's the shit that humans mostly only do by luck or extreme skill that bots can do Trivial and the bot will do it every single shot.

286
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:39,235
Scott: Yeah, every time non-stop right and so like a speed run where it's like.

287
00:17:39,296 --> 00:17:40,922
Scott: Oh here comes a frame perfect part It's like.

288
00:17:40,982 --> 00:17:43,294
Scott: no every single frame is frame perfect.

289
00:17:43,314 --> 00:17:44,340
Scott: the whole game also.

290
00:17:44,581 --> 00:17:46,487
Rym: I set of body game is 40.

291
00:17:46,487 --> 00:17:53,228
Scott: what the game is 40 minutes long 60 FPS with 60 times 40 24,000 I think.

292
00:17:53,288 --> 00:17:57,659
Scott: great perfect inputs six 2,400. every single one of those frames will be frame perfect.

293
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:57,900
Rym: now.

294
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:01,700
Rym: But there's the the skill of humans communicating with you.

295
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,984
Rym: They're on a team to coordinate.

296
00:18:03,245 --> 00:18:07,780
Rym: the bots can communicate faster than humans can communicate if they're allowed to communicate.

297
00:18:08,001 --> 00:18:09,730
Rym: Well humans can talk to each other.

298
00:18:10,293 --> 00:18:11,720
Rym: let the bots talk over a microphone.

299
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,905
Rym: They'll come up with the language.

300
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:16,200
Scott: the bots don't communicate with each other through a communication channel.

301
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,357
Scott: They'll be able to communicate to each other with their movements in the game.

302
00:18:19,377 --> 00:18:24,920
Rym: Yep so It'll be real interesting to see when we get to the point.

303
00:18:25,101 --> 00:18:28,214
Scott: Why did that Bob buy that item sell that item and then buy a different item?

304
00:18:28,335 --> 00:18:29,540
Scott: oh it was signaling to the other bot.

305
00:18:30,012 --> 00:18:37,407
Rym: Yeah I wonder what'll happen to MOBAs as a sport if there are perfect Ai's that are better than all humans no matter what.

306
00:18:37,728 --> 00:18:41,680
Rym: because you can say those by AI's don't exist in the real tournament space.

307
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:47,099
Rym: We're only watching the humans compete, but I feel like the bot competitions would be more interesting to watch.

308
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:48,083
Scott: yeah I want to see race.

309
00:18:48,103 --> 00:18:51,778
Scott: car races where there's no drivers is who can make the best car AI.

310
00:18:51,878 --> 00:18:56,180
Rym: and also There's a there's precedence in the battle of engineering only and not athleticism.

311
00:18:56,381 --> 00:19:00,160
Rym: We know a possible endgame because chess is facing this problem right now, right?

312
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:06,520
Rym: So you can't just have a eyes and the chess tournaments because humans cannot beat a eyes just it's over right in chess.

313
00:19:07,183 --> 00:19:11,460
Rym: So what happened now is that it's humans only in the tournaments.

314
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,103
Rym: That's fine.

315
00:19:12,586 --> 00:19:18,458
Rym: the humans study what the bots are doing Because that is the height of chess.

316
00:19:18,518 --> 00:19:21,800
Scott: yes It's easy to study what a bot does in a fucking turn-based game.

317
00:19:22,062 --> 00:19:24,440
Scott: You can't study what a bot does in a real-time game.

318
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,384
Scott: I mean you can study.

319
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:29,059
Scott: you can study some of its broader strategies like oh see how it does this.

320
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,507
Scott: But you can't be framed perfect for.

321
00:19:31,567 --> 00:19:40,140
Rym: but the end result of this is that chess matches are increasingly ending in draws Because the attractors in chess are more often draws than defeats.

322
00:19:40,563 --> 00:19:42,859
Rym: So it's easier to draw a game out forever.

323
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,600
Rym: Rather than wait like you can't win because the against an AI because it'll always beat you you might be able to force a draw.

324
00:19:49,082 --> 00:19:57,457
Rym: So against a human you're almost better off always going for the draw unless the other person fucks up and the meta of chess is getting real fucked up before someone gets bad.

325
00:19:57,498 --> 00:20:02,475
Scott: at my math a 40-minute game that is 60 FPS would be a hundred and forty four thousand frames.

326
00:20:03,017 --> 00:20:06,531
Rym: All right 144 thousand frame perfect inputs.

327
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:10,418
Rym: Yep beat that beat that soloing mid.

328
00:20:13,221 --> 00:20:15,793
Rym: So in some other news we've talked about this off and on.

329
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:17,380
Rym: knit hog was not the best.

330
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,808
Scott: Why are we even talking about this?

331
00:20:18,888 --> 00:20:20,999
Scott: Well, because now it's just Rym's obsessed with it.

332
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:21,683
Rym: Well, cuz now it's.

333
00:20:21,844 --> 00:20:28,539
Rym: I really like the original lid hog for a lot of reasons They don't - is actually out now and I thought to myself I should buy it.

334
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,583
Scott: No play it.

335
00:20:29,965 --> 00:20:33,056
Scott: so I when we first saw screenshots of the game was hideous and ugly.

336
00:20:33,256 --> 00:20:37,380
Scott: when we saw an action It was nothing like knit hog one and it was even more hideous and more ugly.

337
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,792
Scott: Yeah, every indicator is that.

338
00:20:39,832 --> 00:20:45,860
Scott: yes, it's hideous and ugly But also nothing like knit hog one and a bad game and not a good game.

339
00:20:46,442 --> 00:20:50,740
Scott: The only way it seems to have improved over knit hog one is the netcode is better.

340
00:20:50,901 --> 00:20:52,911
Scott: So at the same time cream still wants to buy.

341
00:20:52,971 --> 00:20:54,659
Scott: remember what more do you need to know?

342
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:57,680
Scott: So remember there's good games you could be buying.

343
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:03,220
Rym: So remember Mario Kart or like Mario Tennis when it came out on the DS or the 3ds or whatever.

344
00:21:04,961 --> 00:21:08,758
Rym: Every single no one reviewed the parts of the game that I cared about.

345
00:21:08,858 --> 00:21:20,700
Rym: like No, I read a bunch of reviews of Mario Tennis and to this day I think we're literally the only people who pointed out that the last incarnation of Mario Tennis was a fundamentally different game.

346
00:21:21,081 --> 00:21:25,720
Rym: Like core mechanics were changed that made it not like timing didn't matter at all.

347
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:31,900
Rym: Like there's all these things that changed that no one reviewed it talked about and I have not found anyone who reviewed knit hog.

348
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:37,000
Scott: You don't need to talk about the details of a game when all you need to tell people is don't buy this don't play it.

349
00:21:37,301 --> 00:21:41,560
Scott: The details of a game are only we're talking about if the game is worth playing and worth thinking about.

350
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:53,552
Rym: So I have not yet read a review that mechanically talked about the impact of The changes to the game on whether or not it's good like no one Significant or important and a game that you shouldn't buy right?

351
00:21:53,632 --> 00:21:58,898
Rym: What's bad about it out - Okay, so first of all there than the fact that it's ugly as shit, right?

352
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,879
Scott: So knit hog one was all about like, you know, you got all you have is a sword, right?

353
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,979
Scott: And you can throw it and you can you know up down stabby stabby, right?

354
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:11,200
Scott: It was all this sort of like, you know clever movements and such and such right?

355
00:22:11,462 --> 00:22:13,197
Scott: Like the core of what a fighting game is.

356
00:22:13,801 --> 00:22:21,428
Scott: Whereas knit hog - there's all these different weapons and it's sort of like a smashy-smashy game and it's not Subtle and elegant in the way.

357
00:22:21,468 --> 00:22:22,071
Rym: need how but why?

358
00:22:22,172 --> 00:22:23,720
Rym: what exactly about the mechanics?

359
00:22:24,321 --> 00:22:27,819
Scott: I I want I haven't played it and I'm not gonna play it to find out cuz it's not worth it.

360
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:28,602
Rym: But that's the thing.

361
00:22:28,683 --> 00:22:36,494
Rym: no one who refused these kinds of games talks about that stuff in detail because they're smart enough to Spend their time when they're playing a shitty game.

362
00:22:36,514 --> 00:22:37,720
Scott: They don't think about it that hard.

363
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:41,459
Scott: It's not worth investing the short time in your life into something bad to figure out it.

364
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,385
Rym: But it might be good.

365
00:22:42,405 --> 00:22:43,933
Rym: and my point is no it's not.

366
00:22:44,175 --> 00:22:45,080
Scott: I guarantee it's not.

367
00:22:45,321 --> 00:22:46,024
Rym: I mean it might not be.

368
00:22:46,065 --> 00:22:47,512
Scott: the problem is it's definitely not.

369
00:22:47,592 --> 00:22:51,698
Rym: literally no one who's reviewed This game has talked about it in that detail.

370
00:22:51,798 --> 00:22:53,764
Rym: good But it might be you don't know.

371
00:22:53,965 --> 00:22:55,470
Rym: you're just sort of assuming a lot of things.

372
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:57,357
Rym: I think you're primarily you wanna bet on it.

373
00:22:59,022 --> 00:23:03,794
Rym: I think you're primarily prejudice against this game because I hate the art and I hate the anime.

374
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:09,330
Scott: if knit hug - is a good game Right, then I will pay for it.

375
00:23:09,411 --> 00:23:13,951
Rym: But if you pay are you buying it out - I'll buy a pal I'll buy with a page around money for one.

376
00:23:13,971 --> 00:23:15,080
Rym: I'm not finding with my money.

377
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:16,947
Scott: Oh, oh, that was gonna be.

378
00:23:17,108 --> 00:23:20,340
Scott: look at what Rym's wasting your money on fucking nidhag - he won't let me waste it.

379
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,957
Scott: I'd like a trip to some tropical island.

380
00:23:24,721 --> 00:23:25,163
Scott: You buy.

381
00:23:25,323 --> 00:23:30,660
Scott: if you buy nidhag - which you shouldn't do and it's actually good I will then pay for it.

382
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:42,237
Scott: So it doesn't cost you anything, but if you buy nidhag - and it sucks as I said, it sucks Yeah, you then also give me the price of nidhag - in my head and you stand you also.

383
00:23:42,357 --> 00:23:44,066
Scott: so basically you had to pay Double what it cost.

384
00:23:44,086 --> 00:23:45,920
Scott: thing is once to me and one to the creators.

385
00:23:46,301 --> 00:23:52,360
Rym: I do worry that it sucks, but I have no mechanical verification of that and all the people who say it sucks.

386
00:23:52,781 --> 00:23:55,973
Rym: Well, what a lot of people say it's great, but the people who say it sounds great.

387
00:23:56,294 --> 00:23:57,719
Rym: I've reviews are pretty good.

388
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:06,876
Rym: This rock-paper-shotgun review is the only Negative review from a legit outpost I can find and it's not even that negative.

389
00:24:06,896 --> 00:24:07,840
Scott: What a review of you read.

390
00:24:08,101 --> 00:24:10,636
Rym: I read a whole bunch today because I wanted to talk about this tonight.

391
00:24:10,656 --> 00:24:11,360
Rym: I was just skimming through.

392
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,974
Scott: Why do you want to talk about this baggie?

393
00:24:13,297 --> 00:24:18,879
Rym: Cuz you Also, I'd say that it's still a lot better than that civ6 board game.

394
00:24:20,021 --> 00:24:21,186
Scott: Well, that's not saying much.

395
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:29,960
Rym: and also like people don't review games Mechanically anymore mostly good game to review mechanically something worth thinking about.

396
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:33,289
Rym: Well, I think we're gonna review investing time.

397
00:24:33,309 --> 00:24:35,960
Rym: We're gonna talk about pac-man verse again in a little bit cuz it's back.

398
00:24:36,144 --> 00:24:36,453
Scott: Oh, yeah.

399
00:24:37,262 --> 00:24:39,829
Rym: So this is probably the biggest other news that we got.

400
00:24:40,331 --> 00:24:41,033
Rym: so for honor.

401
00:24:41,053 --> 00:24:43,460
Scott: I know I knew that there was a game called for honor.

402
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,526
Scott: I knew nothing else about it.

403
00:24:44,908 --> 00:24:49,732
Rym: It's a game that looks moderately fun But the gist at first I mean I have not actually played it.

404
00:24:49,812 --> 00:24:51,480
Scott: Is it an FPS or a third person?

405
00:24:52,881 --> 00:24:55,773
Rym: This stuff how do you not like talk to an old person to read the Internet?

406
00:24:56,195 --> 00:24:57,039
Scott: What kind of game is it?

407
00:24:57,721 --> 00:24:59,153
Rym: So usually you really don't know.

408
00:24:59,173 --> 00:24:59,879
Scott: I have no idea.

409
00:25:00,162 --> 00:25:02,199
Scott: So imagine that you didn't know either before a few days ago.

410
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:06,460
Rym: No, I knew because I've seen a whole bunch of memes about this game and people talk about this game.

411
00:25:06,541 --> 00:25:07,673
Rym: I saw a lot of people on Twitter.

412
00:25:07,774 --> 00:25:08,320
Scott: I've never heard.

413
00:25:08,522 --> 00:25:09,127
Scott: I only knew.

414
00:25:09,147 --> 00:25:10,660
Scott: I knew there was a game called for honor.

415
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:22,269
Scott: I knew nothing else about it until this news in which now I know that a thing happened to the for honor tournament But I still don't know what kind of game so imagine like Combat kind of like Dark Souls, but not that crazy.

416
00:25:22,309 --> 00:25:26,340
Rym: a third-person walk around hit things game, but no no, but it's a fighting game.

417
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,792
Rym: It's like 2v2 or 4v4 with an objective.

418
00:25:28,812 --> 00:25:47,120
Rym: It's a 2v2 So like a knight and an assassin in a FPS looking world like a castle or something Versus an assassin and a samurai and you have this big duel for honor With your weapons and it looks moderately fun.

419
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:47,421
Rym: It's just.

420
00:25:47,481 --> 00:25:52,080
Rym: it's a game that is not above my line of play right now because of all the reasons we talked about before.

421
00:25:52,422 --> 00:25:53,469
Scott: Yeah, I don't need to play that.

422
00:25:53,872 --> 00:25:54,697
Rym: I kind of want to play it though.

423
00:25:54,717 --> 00:25:57,840
Rym: It looks fun But if I'm gonna play anything I'd play that pub G before I play for honor.

424
00:25:59,541 --> 00:26:01,028
Rym: So the deal is there's been.

425
00:26:01,048 --> 00:26:03,739
Rym: um, so I learned some updates about some issues with this game.

426
00:26:04,182 --> 00:26:13,100
Rym: But basically for honor has a long-standing Exploit where you can do what they call it unlock tech and I don't know enough about the game to go into details.

427
00:26:13,542 --> 00:26:21,289
Rym: But basically you can do a thing to make it difficult or impossible For opponents to parry a certain kind of attack.

428
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:22,291
Rym: you might do so.

429
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:23,515
Scott: you can basically have an attack.

430
00:26:23,555 --> 00:26:26,682
Scott: that guaranteed to hit that guaranteed Unperiable.

431
00:26:26,742 --> 00:26:30,035
Rym: they could dodge it to do other things, but they can't parry it.

432
00:26:30,176 --> 00:26:37,228
Rym: Mm-hmm And someone legit just use this Saw constantly to win a tournament.

433
00:26:37,489 --> 00:26:41,480
Rym: good knowingly and constantly good job anyone cuz the rule that's part of the game.

434
00:26:41,842 --> 00:26:42,949
Scott: Why didn't the other people do this?

435
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:48,095
Rym: because they're stupid, okay That's the only explanation I can find is that the all maybe they weren't good enough.

436
00:26:48,135 --> 00:26:49,160
Scott: Maybe it's hard to do or something.

437
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,776
Rym: Yeah, it doesn't seem like it's that hard to do and also to their credit.

438
00:26:52,816 --> 00:26:57,754
Rym: I'm quoting the article He got the trophy for honors creative director said and this is a quote.

439
00:26:57,794 --> 00:26:59,560
Rym: This is what he said while he awarded the trophy.

440
00:27:00,304 --> 00:27:01,058
Rym: Good job, buddy.

441
00:27:01,781 --> 00:27:07,234
Rym: Soon you may have to change your play style Mm-hmm implying that the exploit will soon be patched out of the game.

442
00:27:07,676 --> 00:27:08,560
Rym: He got his 10 grand.

443
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:10,005
Scott: Yeah, they probably.

444
00:27:10,145 --> 00:27:13,195
Scott: you know the terms of the agreement and the tournament entry probably couldn't.

445
00:27:13,355 --> 00:27:15,081
Scott: they couldn't deny him because it wasn't against the Rules.

446
00:27:15,302 --> 00:27:19,600
Rym: so man machine on Twitter pointed something out real interesting because I don't know enough about the meta of this game.

447
00:27:19,921 --> 00:27:21,085
Scott: I don't even know what kind of game it was.

448
00:27:21,105 --> 00:27:23,473
Rym: There's way more to this story.

449
00:27:23,513 --> 00:27:28,308
Rym: Apparently the meta right now is Heavily defensive play and is boring.

450
00:27:28,589 --> 00:27:31,700
Scott: if someone can be super on you can't parry my attack.

451
00:27:32,121 --> 00:27:36,354
Scott: I guess my only way to do is to be super defensive and block or dodge everything.

452
00:27:36,434 --> 00:27:37,317
Rym: a smash tournament.

453
00:27:37,337 --> 00:27:41,127
Rym: That's based on Lives remaining as opposed to kills.

454
00:27:41,448 --> 00:27:44,679
Rym: the Rym strategies is pretty effective depending on the stage, right?

455
00:27:45,261 --> 00:27:46,613
Rym: Don't fight anyone hide forever.

456
00:27:46,673 --> 00:27:47,259
Rym: Fuck you all.

457
00:27:48,751 --> 00:27:54,960
Rym: But basically this defensive strategy much like the trap in hockey sucks to watch sucks to play against sucks to play.

458
00:27:55,241 --> 00:27:58,017
Rym: Yeah, so a lot of people in this is boring.

459
00:27:58,077 --> 00:28:12,070
Rym: a lot of people Seeing a fight coming up soon A champion of defense are apparently very defensive of this glitch because this glitch is Actually a really effective way to break that fucking defensive meta.

460
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:12,230
Rym: Mm-hmm.

461
00:28:13,092 --> 00:28:17,880
Rym: So the community is really split on whether or not Exploiting this is truly exploitative.

462
00:28:18,021 --> 00:28:21,938
Scott: It sounds like what you should do is not play this garbage game and play something else.

463
00:28:21,978 --> 00:28:28,908
Scott: the same thing You should do with Nidhogg do but at the same time Ubisoft, which I've never most garbage game publisher Not the most garbage.

464
00:28:28,949 --> 00:28:29,854
Scott: who's more garbage.

465
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,108
Rym: Uh Who's most garbage?

466
00:28:32,531 --> 00:28:33,700
Rym: who is the most garbage?

467
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,000
Scott: Even EA is better than Ubisoft.

468
00:28:36,221 --> 00:28:38,171
Rym: but the the other component of all this the bit.

469
00:28:38,231 --> 00:28:52,326
Rym: one of the big debates is that Many big eSports like almost everything in modern MOBAs were built around what were originally Basically exploits of a poorly designed game Dota, I mean last hitting.

470
00:28:52,346 --> 00:29:06,690
Rym: no one sane on earth would argue that last hitting is a good mechanic But it became an effective mechanic to optimize play in a game and then like Later game design sort of built around it.

471
00:29:07,092 --> 00:29:09,400
Rym: So is this one of those things?

472
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,304
Rym: Is this an exploit?

473
00:29:11,766 --> 00:29:15,220
Rym: and the answer is Ubisoft gets to decide because they're the ones who run this scene.

474
00:29:15,541 --> 00:29:20,320
Scott: I guess people are playing it and they have a tournament that is big enough to make the news.

475
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,591
Scott: So but props to the Ubisoft will be money.

476
00:29:23,892 --> 00:29:25,036
Rym: This is one of the first time.

477
00:29:25,057 --> 00:29:26,000
Scott: I don't give them any props.

478
00:29:26,281 --> 00:29:38,360
Rym: This is one of the first times in modern eSports where I think the use of an exploit was handled correctly and frankly I'm disappointed and all the other people in this tournament who did not do anything about it in the context of the game.

479
00:29:39,201 --> 00:29:39,724
Rym: Why did they?

480
00:29:39,966 --> 00:29:40,831
Rym: they knew he'd do it?

481
00:29:41,132 --> 00:29:42,400
Rym: What do they think was gonna happen?

482
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:48,539
Rym: It'd be like if I went to a Mario Kart DS tournament and I was like, I ain't gonna snake I have honor and everyone else is just like.

483
00:29:54,241 --> 00:29:56,187
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

484
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:56,729
Rym: What do you got?

485
00:29:57,431 --> 00:29:57,993
Scott: What do I have?

486
00:29:58,053 --> 00:30:00,100
Scott: So our friend Luca Crane?

487
00:30:00,625 --> 00:30:02,098
Scott: Who not Luca Crane?

488
00:30:02,138 --> 00:30:09,100
Scott: I just Luke Crane who has made the burning wheel and many other excellent games and his official job.

489
00:30:09,481 --> 00:30:12,229
Scott: I think they actually changed his job title to be correct.

490
00:30:12,871 --> 00:30:14,797
Scott: He is head of games at Kickstarter.

491
00:30:14,837 --> 00:30:15,620
Scott: That is his job.

492
00:30:15,963 --> 00:30:17,680
Scott: He is in charge of all kick-started games.

493
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:25,880
Rym: Luke Crane is literally responsible for the front row crew and GeekNights Discovering a world outside of Dungeons & Dragons like games in role-playing.

494
00:30:25,981 --> 00:30:31,031
Scott: Well, I think we knew that world was there But we basically looked down on it and paid no attention to it.

495
00:30:31,091 --> 00:30:38,250
Scott: cuz every nerd who's like I'm gonna make my own system All that guy and he was the one who wasn't that guy.

496
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:44,307
Rym: Yep, and then we spread birdie wheel far but anyway He was at some convention.

497
00:30:44,348 --> 00:30:45,432
Scott: I think in Europe somewhere.

498
00:30:45,512 --> 00:30:46,014
Scott: Where was this?

499
00:30:46,035 --> 00:30:48,887
Scott: I Can't tell I don't know.

500
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:50,514
Scott: It's called a maze.

501
00:30:50,594 --> 00:30:53,525
Scott: was the convention or conference He was at and it was.

502
00:30:53,565 --> 00:31:00,429
Scott: it was a video gaming conference of some kind and he's given a panel there as you know Head of games at Kickstarter and that's Vincent Baker.

503
00:31:00,489 --> 00:31:06,312
Scott: Oh, hey, that's me and he's talking about this game He made called inheritance, which is so full disclosure.

504
00:31:06,332 --> 00:31:08,480
Rym: I kick-started like the nice version.

505
00:31:08,562 --> 00:31:16,887
Scott: I mean, oh, yeah We don't need to tell you the story about this game because when you watch this video You're gonna hear the full story about this game, but I will say this I but it is a story.

506
00:31:16,987 --> 00:31:19,560
Scott: it is a story in which we are tangentially related.

507
00:31:19,802 --> 00:31:29,700
Rym: So this cuz we this Incident that is on the screen right now on the stream Where I'm standing there with my hand over my chest and Vincent Baker is lying on the ground.

508
00:31:30,162 --> 00:31:34,664
Rym: this was like a one of the later play tests of inheritance at a burning con.

509
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:35,869
Rym: right, yeah, was that a burning con?

510
00:31:35,889 --> 00:31:47,588
Rym: and This events this game this larp that I played that physical instance was literally like one of the top three best Gaming experiences I've ever had in my life.

511
00:31:47,728 --> 00:31:55,820
Scott: I played I'm not extremely extremely early version in 2000-whatever at UberCon that was using the burning wheel system.

512
00:31:55,881 --> 00:32:01,495
Scott: It wasn't a larp yet And that was one of the still one of the best RPG things there was like I got like.

513
00:32:01,575 --> 00:32:02,959
Rym: I cannot express you like.

514
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:05,405
Rym: Try the entirety.

515
00:32:05,425 --> 00:32:09,080
Scott: Yeah, it wasn't until mere months ago that we had this game in our hands.

516
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,446
Scott: That's how long this game was made.

517
00:32:10,506 --> 00:32:16,692
Rym: the entirety of my time playing tribes 2 is Equal to or possibly lesser than the 4 hours.

518
00:32:16,752 --> 00:32:18,660
Rym: I played this game this one time.

519
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,591
Rym: Yeah, probably and a bunch of our like holy shit.

520
00:32:21,952 --> 00:32:28,244
Scott: after all that waiting of 10 plus years We now have a copy of this game To this day.

521
00:32:28,284 --> 00:32:31,093
Rym: Vincent Baker is salty about what I did to him.

522
00:32:31,113 --> 00:32:35,999
Scott: Well according to Luke in this panel is still salty Yeah And all I say is that what could I do?

523
00:32:36,642 --> 00:32:42,863
Rym: Luke handed me the knife and basically said do what would do what thou wilt and What I will.

524
00:32:42,903 --> 00:32:44,851
Scott: a knife only does one thing stab.

525
00:32:44,891 --> 00:32:46,297
Scott: well two things stabby and cutty.

526
00:32:46,638 --> 00:32:48,896
Rym: and frankly you know the real villain here is our friend cat.

527
00:32:48,957 --> 00:32:52,851
Rym: because Not to so cats character.

528
00:32:53,192 --> 00:33:00,593
Rym: basically in joke heading character Said I could marry her daughter Which is the thing I actually wanted other than all the other things I wanted.

529
00:33:00,633 --> 00:33:01,757
Rym: but that was the thing I really wanted.

530
00:33:02,219 --> 00:33:07,120
Rym: and she Was like I'll only let you marry her if you bring me Vincent Baker's fucking head.

531
00:33:07,961 --> 00:33:09,227
Rym: And I was like sure.

532
00:33:09,247 --> 00:33:11,980
Rym: and then Luke was like oh, we got to play this out.

533
00:33:12,682 --> 00:33:15,031
Rym: Oh, we got to play this out and Vince is like really.

534
00:33:15,051 --> 00:33:16,897
Rym: and we had this final encounter.

535
00:33:16,937 --> 00:33:18,925
Rym: and holy crap That was a moment.

536
00:33:19,406 --> 00:33:23,120
Rym: this video is great though looks a pretty good lecturer as well.

537
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,446
Rym: You should go check out his other videos.

538
00:33:24,727 --> 00:33:27,700
Scott: Yeah, but yeah watch this so learn a story.

539
00:33:28,263 --> 00:33:36,500
Rym: I was doing research for some of our new panels and So remember way back I talked about I did this thing of the day long long time ago, but there's this video.

540
00:33:36,601 --> 00:33:38,579
Rym: That's every way to die in shadow gate.

541
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,271
Scott: So there's a don't do every way to die in deja vu.

542
00:33:42,813 --> 00:33:48,123
Rym: uh yeah, I've seen that video Okay, but I never actually played Uninvited.

543
00:33:48,464 --> 00:33:51,152
Rym: what the hell's uninvited you holy shit uninvited.

544
00:33:51,312 --> 00:33:53,499
Scott: is that another shadow gate or deja vu type game?

545
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:54,884
Scott: yes But I have never heard of.

546
00:33:55,285 --> 00:33:58,255
Scott: uh what the fuck what the fuck system is it on any s?

547
00:33:58,616 --> 00:34:00,302
Rym: really you can play it on the Thought.

548
00:34:00,322 --> 00:34:01,366
Scott: there were only two games.

549
00:34:01,607 --> 00:34:03,855
Rym: no so this was a hidden third game.

550
00:34:03,895 --> 00:34:05,722
Scott: this whole time my whole life I didn't know.

551
00:34:06,024 --> 00:34:09,579
Scott: are you sure this isn't like some alternate matrix kind of glitch thing we're like?

552
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:11,828
Rym: well I did not expect you to not know about this game.

553
00:34:11,868 --> 00:34:14,719
Scott: You just created this game out of nowhere to fool me.

554
00:34:15,542 --> 00:34:18,331
Scott: So all I'll say you think it always existed when it didn't.

555
00:34:18,672 --> 00:34:23,585
Rym: so this game is probably way more Complex and interesting than shadow gate.

556
00:34:24,087 --> 00:34:25,350
Scott: Let's deja vu is more interesting.

557
00:34:25,489 --> 00:34:32,040
Rym: Yeah, but more importantly the deaths in This game there aren't as many as shadow gate.

558
00:34:32,561 --> 00:34:38,679
Rym: Holy holy fuck are they like beyond the pale of horrible.

559
00:34:38,802 --> 00:34:40,100
Scott: I think this game was just invented.

560
00:34:40,742 --> 00:34:57,147
Rym: so this is a video that is a ton of the deaths in uninvited and the next video in this person's channel is the rest of the deaths and This is worth a watch because these deaths are Haunting and terrifying.

561
00:34:57,488 --> 00:34:59,839
Scott: oh yeah to research this game that you just made up.

562
00:35:00,782 --> 00:35:04,595
Scott: So the plot I think I just entered a different world here where they were three games.

563
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:13,280
Rym: in this plot of this game is that you and your Fiance or sister some girl like crash your car you go somewhere that you weren't invited.

564
00:35:13,521 --> 00:35:16,328
Rym: Yeah, you you crash your car and your sister disappears.

565
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:21,926
Rym: So you go into a house that you're not invited into and there's a Transylvanians in there.

566
00:35:21,946 --> 00:35:24,960
Scott: uh of the transvestite variety it appeared.

567
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,824
Rym: No, that would be a whole different game.

568
00:35:26,925 --> 00:35:29,210
Rym: No, I want to play a dating game.

569
00:35:29,611 --> 00:35:35,763
Rym: I want to play the dating game of that Holy shit Movie.

570
00:35:35,783 --> 00:35:40,460
Rym: you don't need a game a dating game of the rocky horror picture show characters.

571
00:35:41,022 --> 00:35:42,528
Rym: I can't believe that doesn't exist.

572
00:35:42,568 --> 00:35:43,090
Scott: Don't make it.

573
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:44,716
Rym: I should I should license it.

574
00:35:44,756 --> 00:35:45,880
Rym: Holy shit would that make money?

575
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,380
Rym: I would just hide the money expensive license.

576
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:54,760
Rym: I the people who made dream daddy that exact creative team should just make the rocky horror picture show dating game.

577
00:35:55,122 --> 00:35:56,591
Rym: I would invest all the money I have.

578
00:35:57,074 --> 00:35:57,939
Rym: that would make so much money.

579
00:35:58,622 --> 00:36:09,894
Rym: If you think the death screen and the death music and shadow gate is haunting The red skull of death in this game and the sound that happens when you die America's mortal enemy.

580
00:36:09,975 --> 00:36:10,640
Rym: This is good biz.

581
00:36:11,822 --> 00:36:14,539
Rym: In the matter moment the booklet book is the fifth season which we're gonna do soon.

Rym: Not three not five, but four days of paxing in the heart of Seattle.

597
00:37:05,202 --> 00:37:06,547
Rym: Oh, thanks.

598
00:37:06,567 --> 00:37:07,793
Rym: Wes is my favorite kind of love.

599
00:37:07,833 --> 00:37:09,219
Rym: you mag fat, but you're number two.

600
00:37:10,224 --> 00:37:12,074
Rym: Number two is still a pretty good honor there.

601
00:37:12,175 --> 00:37:12,960
Scott: It's a waffle.

602
00:37:13,801 --> 00:37:16,113
Scott: I'm gonna get a crack and my flight is like lady.

603
00:37:16,273 --> 00:37:17,620
Scott: I just like afternoon on Tuesday.

604
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,746
Scott: So I got all this time.

605
00:37:18,766 --> 00:37:21,559
Rym: I might go to biscuit bitch for breakfast before I fly home.

606
00:37:22,085 --> 00:37:22,874
Scott: It's gonna be yeah.

607
00:37:23,863 --> 00:37:27,080
Rym: But we're doing on Sunday a panel not on quitting.

608
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:31,252
Rym: I like the high level of like what is quitting but this is like rage.

609
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:35,866
Rym: quit specifically those fuckers Mm-hmm, and it's on Sunday.

610
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:37,974
Scott: I'm just can't think of a new panel idea.

611
00:37:37,994 --> 00:37:38,897
Scott: He's got a redo.

612
00:37:39,319 --> 00:37:39,941
Rym: All right We got.

613
00:37:40,001 --> 00:37:41,266
Rym: actually we were talking about this.

614
00:37:41,326 --> 00:37:50,036
Rym: So the 2018 heat nights panels will require more research But I think I'm doing these same panels, so I'm making new ones.

615
00:37:50,056 --> 00:37:51,020
Rym: We've only been doing it for a year.

616
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:54,819
Rym: We basically every year we pick a set of panels quitting panels like three years old at least.

617
00:37:55,562 --> 00:37:56,265
Rym: Well between.

618
00:37:56,305 --> 00:37:57,831
Rym: so I actually changed it all.

619
00:37:57,872 --> 00:37:58,936
Rym: if you looked at the slides yet.

620
00:37:59,056 --> 00:38:00,731
Rym: It's not the same pen Oh, but you barely.

621
00:38:00,812 --> 00:38:05,090
Rym: uh It's like 60% plus different same idea.

622
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:05,933
Scott: It's not a new idea.

623
00:38:05,973 --> 00:38:07,177
Scott: Yeah, it has got to make sense.

624
00:38:07,177 --> 00:38:07,297
Scott: 100% new.

625
00:38:08,402 --> 00:38:08,864
Rym: No, you don't.

626
00:38:08,925 --> 00:38:09,126
Rym: plus.

627
00:38:09,146 --> 00:38:14,931
Scott: it also has a completely different moral Like some DJ who can't come up with the new melodies you just remixing.

628
00:38:15,232 --> 00:38:15,934
Rym: I like to mix.

629
00:38:16,215 --> 00:38:19,612
Rym: that's you two mixes one song remixed A hundred times as you right now.

630
00:38:19,894 --> 00:38:20,760
Scott: I'm gonna make new music.

631
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:23,673
Rym: What panel did you give me that I could have submitted to PAX West?

632
00:38:24,095 --> 00:38:25,240
Scott: I didn't think we were gonna redo.

633
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,465
Scott: I thought you were gay.

634
00:38:26,626 --> 00:38:27,128
Rym: What do you think?

635
00:38:27,208 --> 00:38:27,770
Rym: I told you.

636
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:28,935
Rym: Hey, here's my ideas.

637
00:38:28,995 --> 00:38:32,695
Rym: and you said, okay You didn't say anything that I'm making new ones now.

638
00:38:32,715 --> 00:38:33,539
Scott: I'm tired of shit.

639
00:38:35,881 --> 00:38:38,410
Scott: You make any new ones lazy man, I did.

640
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:39,052
Rym: I made this one.

641
00:38:39,313 --> 00:38:40,758
Rym: it's not new I think it is.

642
00:38:40,778 --> 00:38:41,360
Scott: it's a remix.

643
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,405
Rym: It's actually pretty new.

644
00:38:42,425 --> 00:38:42,967
Scott: It's not new.

645
00:38:43,269 --> 00:38:45,017
Rym: Also how many times you think we've done this panel?

646
00:38:45,037 --> 00:38:45,600
Rym: because you're busy.

647
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:50,425
Scott: You're busy inventing entire video games and never existed like uninvited New panel.

648
00:38:50,846 --> 00:38:51,147
Rym: careful.

649
00:38:51,167 --> 00:38:53,917
Rym: If you play on invaded you'll get fully taken into the hell dimension.

650
00:38:53,937 --> 00:38:54,419
Rym: Uh-huh.

651
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:59,520
Rym: So yeah, Namco Museum came out on the switch.

652
00:38:59,681 --> 00:39:01,095
Scott: Well Namco Museum has been on man.

653
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:08,260
Rym: The museum is a franchise with many iterations that are all like there's like a mix match of different Namco games.

654
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,419
Scott: Yeah, I'm pretty sure it goes back to like PlayStation.

655
00:39:10,761 --> 00:39:12,486
Scott: I think is the maybe the first time.

656
00:39:12,506 --> 00:39:21,180
Rym: we are only talking about the release that just happened recently on the switch Right, which confusingly is literally just called Namco Museum.

657
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:24,860
Scott: If you go back in time to the arcades right all the best arcade games.

658
00:39:25,101 --> 00:39:27,648
Scott: There are some made by Nintendo like a Donkey Konga.

659
00:39:27,828 --> 00:39:31,960
Scott: Yeah, there is some made by Atari like a pole position or a centipede.

660
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,767
Rym: There's the Bimanis by Konami's.

661
00:39:33,908 --> 00:39:36,800
Scott: Well, that's way newer, but I'm talking about classic arcade games, right?

662
00:39:37,262 --> 00:39:44,447
Scott: Most of the best classic arcade games are made by Namco Pac-man Dig-dug Ms.

663
00:39:44,508 --> 00:39:46,783
Scott: Pac-man Galaga.

664
00:39:47,104 --> 00:39:53,199
Scott: it's like pretty much all if I'm gonna make an arcade in my house out of old real arcade machines.

665
00:39:53,219 --> 00:39:55,565
Scott: a Lot of them are gonna be Namco machines.

666
00:39:55,866 --> 00:39:57,310
Scott: Maybe even more than 50%.

667
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:58,513
Rym: so who made Rampart?

668
00:39:58,553 --> 00:40:00,880
Scott: actually don't know also Namco.

669
00:40:02,401 --> 00:40:13,525
Scott: Anyway, so they always release these collection things of like hey If you want to play these old Namco arcade games on your modern console, no, no Atari Really?

670
00:40:13,546 --> 00:40:15,040
Rym: It was on the Atari platform.

671
00:40:15,901 --> 00:40:17,968
Rym: All right captain news to me.

672
00:40:18,109 --> 00:40:19,454
Rym: Anyway, why did you think why?

673
00:40:19,514 --> 00:40:20,397
Rym: why did you make that up?

674
00:40:20,457 --> 00:40:21,140
Rym: Why were you wrong?

675
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,086
Scott: Cuz it's on the name code.

676
00:40:23,347 --> 00:40:25,274
Scott: is it collection with the cinestar and whatever?

677
00:40:25,294 --> 00:40:26,217
Rym: anyway anyway.

678
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:37,334
Scott: so Like I was saying they release these discs that collect a whole bunch of Namco arcade games together Right into a single software package.

679
00:40:37,394 --> 00:40:46,418
Scott: that even in the year 2017 you can buy a game from 1982 and not feel bad because you would never pay this amount of money to get just dig dug, right

680
00:40:46,941 --> 00:40:49,429
Rym: I mean I might depend but I've

681
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:54,775
Scott: probably put more money in quarters into dig dug machines Than it would cost to buy this collection.

682
00:40:54,896 --> 00:41:01,880
Rym: more importantly These games are sort of official like they're real official legit ports and like really what it is.

683
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,409
Scott: I'm pretty sure it's just meme.

684
00:41:03,429 --> 00:41:05,420
Scott: Oh, yeah where the user interface?

685
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,300
Rym: Well, because the options are the same like you and the options on dig dug.

686
00:41:08,381 --> 00:41:11,102
Rym: You can be like turn our peg man You can.

687
00:41:11,303 --> 00:41:16,862
Rym: there's a fix for the kill screen that you can turn on and off and you can like pick what arcade mode you Want to put.

688
00:41:16,882 --> 00:41:21,540
Scott: pretty sure that this is just an emulator with ROMs that you buy to run on your console.

689
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:26,595
Scott: That only plays a small set of ROMs that are included and that's it, but they're so polished.

690
00:41:26,895 --> 00:41:31,910
Rym: They just work perfectly And they link up to like internet servers.

691
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:34,560
Rym: So if you get a high score like it just ranks you with all your friends.

692
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:36,385
Scott: Yeah, and no one's hacked the scores yet.

693
00:41:37,068 --> 00:41:45,650
Rym: and more importantly this damn cool museum is special because it includes one of the best Multiplayer GameCube games on earth.

694
00:41:45,871 --> 00:41:46,092
Scott: Yes.

695
00:41:46,152 --> 00:41:50,120
Scott: Not only does this one most of the time They just include a bunch of old arcade games, right?

696
00:41:50,381 --> 00:41:53,600
Scott: But this one includes a non arcade game.

697
00:41:54,101 --> 00:42:09,116
Scott: that is a game that up until now if you wanted to play this game, you would need to buy a GameCube a GBA of some kind the game and Three game of cube controllers to go with your GBA and a link cable.

698
00:42:09,417 --> 00:42:10,200
Scott: if you can find one.

699
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,727
Scott: I have a whole bunch where you can't have them.

700
00:42:12,048 --> 00:42:13,153
Scott: It is included.

701
00:42:13,193 --> 00:42:14,820
Rym: No, there is no other way to play.

702
00:42:15,383 --> 00:42:16,890
Rym: No, there's one other way to play it.

703
00:42:17,011 --> 00:42:18,719
Rym: What is the other way ten years ago?

704
00:42:19,383 --> 00:42:21,698
Rym: Namco Museum came out Namco Museum came out on the DS.

705
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,182
Rym: Really Pac-man.

706
00:42:24,202 --> 00:42:32,205
Rym: Galica's Xevious Super Xevious Galaxian Mappy Land Tower of Druaga dig dug - oh And a remake of Pac-man verse.

707
00:42:32,566 --> 00:42:39,769
Scott: All right, but yeah Pac-man versus you have the arcade these days and they got this bullshit there Which we think we've talked about called Pac-man battle royale.

708
00:42:39,849 --> 00:42:40,572
Rym: It is awful.

709
00:42:40,753 --> 00:42:42,560
Scott: Pac-man battle royale is a pile of shit.

710
00:42:42,941 --> 00:42:50,120
Rym: The alternate rules that packs used for the omega-thon finale were way better than the actual rules of that game.

711
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,600
Scott: But that game is still a pile of shit even at the and even under those circumstances.

712
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:58,998
Scott: so the way that game works Pac-man battle royale is Eating pills doesn't fucking matter.

713
00:42:59,521 --> 00:43:04,260
Scott: All that matters is you live longer than your other Pac-man.

714
00:43:04,421 --> 00:43:07,694
Scott: There's four Pac-mans and you got to eat your friends or push them into ghosts.

715
00:43:07,734 --> 00:43:08,497
Scott: and that's the whole thing.

716
00:43:08,558 --> 00:43:09,100
Scott: and it's stupid.

717
00:43:09,645 --> 00:43:11,140
Scott: Pac-man verse is legit.

718
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:16,940
Scott: The way Pac-man verse works is one player is Pac-man and the other players are ghosts.

719
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,306
Rym: So you don't understand back then.

720
00:43:18,386 --> 00:43:26,696
Rym: this is why the GameCube link take cable was so utterly Revolutionary because the person who's Pac-man on their gay on their Gameboy?

721
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:30,411
Rym: Gameboy Advance Literally just sees normal Pac-man.

722
00:43:30,432 --> 00:43:31,215
Rym: They're just playing back.

723
00:43:31,235 --> 00:43:32,180
Scott: They're playing Pac-man.

724
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,279
Scott: They see the full the full map.

725
00:43:34,701 --> 00:43:44,000
Scott: All they're doing is playing Pac-man except they're playing against ghosts that are much more dangerous Because they're controlled by humans and not by the default Pac-man AI.

726
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,128
Rym: The ghosts are all on the TV.

727
00:43:46,188 --> 00:43:53,436
Scott: the ghosts are looking at the TV and but the thing with when you're a ghost All you can see is this very limited radius around your ghost.

728
00:43:53,456 --> 00:43:54,460
Scott: You can't see the whole map.

729
00:43:54,801 --> 00:44:00,080
Scott: So you're not always sure where Pac-man is and if you kill Pac-man you become Pac-man.

730
00:44:00,341 --> 00:44:03,436
Rym: Yep, we won't get into like the super details the way this works.

731
00:44:03,536 --> 00:44:08,606
Rym: on the switch everyone has a switch or You only need to one switch.

732
00:44:08,906 --> 00:44:13,140
Scott: one screen run switches the Pac-man and the other switch is all the Pac-man ghosts, right?

733
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,600
Rym: So we're not gonna get into depth about Pac-man first.

734
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,048
Rym: All I want to say is that it is like that is.

735
00:44:18,089 --> 00:44:26,180
Scott: the reason to pay for this game alone is to get Pac-man verse because it's the best way to get Pac-man verse cuz no other ways to get it are gonna be too difficult.

736
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:30,200
Rym: I cannot express to you how much we're going to play Pac-man verse at PAX West.

737
00:44:30,442 --> 00:44:37,770
Scott: You also need to know that even if you just have a switch Only one of your friends needs to pay the money to buy this game Everyone else.

738
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:38,012
Scott: that's.

739
00:44:38,113 --> 00:44:43,340
Scott: in the e-shop There is a free download that I recommend you get no matter what if you have a switch at all.

740
00:44:43,641 --> 00:44:47,360
Scott: That will let you give you basically the client to be a ghost, right?

741
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:52,720
Scott: So that way you can just join in on a Pac-man verse for free if one person owns it.

742
00:44:53,002 --> 00:44:54,050
Rym: It also has a mode.

743
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:56,403
Rym: if you only have one switch It just only.

744
00:44:56,604 --> 00:44:58,610
Rym: basically it's only ghosts and the.

745
00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:02,847
Rym: no one can be Pac-man and it's obviously not the full experience But it's not that bad.

746
00:45:03,109 --> 00:45:04,400
Scott: That's better than no Pac-man verse.

747
00:45:04,942 --> 00:45:06,571
Rym: Yeah, but I'll dig up the.

748
00:45:06,651 --> 00:45:08,380
Rym: I'm sure we reviewed this at some point a long time.

749
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,910
Scott: Yes, we did super long ago like two thousand five or six like.

750
00:45:12,211 --> 00:45:22,378
Scott: I cannot express to you how great Pac-man versus versus the best Multiplayer Pac-man and is maybe one of the best local multiplayer games period.

751
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:26,417
Scott: yeah It's not that I mean, it's not the best period but this is it's way up there.

752
00:45:26,638 --> 00:45:29,362
Rym: So damn cute Museum is Just.

753
00:45:29,402 --> 00:45:33,620
Rym: you know that and all these other games and it's worth buying just because of Pac-man first buy it.

754
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:39,560
Scott: Even if you don't care about any other the games on this list It is worth buying one copy of this in your friend group just for the Pac-man verse.

755
00:45:39,882 --> 00:45:43,160
Rym: I feel like we should spend like a couple minutes for viewing each of the games.

756
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:48,140
Scott: But it also comes with all these old classic arcade games and we'll review them all beginning with the best one dig dug.

757
00:45:48,742 --> 00:45:50,288
Rym: How about we go in chronological order?

758
00:45:50,349 --> 00:45:51,332
Rym: Cuz that's the list I have here.

759
00:45:51,413 --> 00:45:54,163
Scott: What's older than dig dug dig dig as old as me Pac-man.

760
00:45:54,444 --> 00:45:55,246
Scott: Pac-man is old and dig.

761
00:45:55,287 --> 00:45:56,691
Scott: I guess it is 1980.

762
00:45:56,691 --> 00:45:57,975
Scott: It's the original Pac-man.

763
00:45:58,035 --> 00:45:59,420
Scott: It's not as good as miss Pac-man.

764
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,547
Scott: It's not as good as Pac-man.

765
00:46:00,567 --> 00:46:02,580
Rym: see yeah, that's a lot of people disagree.

766
00:46:02,721 --> 00:46:04,369
Rym: I'd like I've gotten some vitriol over this before.

767
00:46:04,409 --> 00:46:06,137
Rym: I think miss Pac-man is better than Pac-man.

768
00:46:06,298 --> 00:46:09,549
Scott: sure Pac-man is almost the worst Pac-man.

769
00:46:09,569 --> 00:46:10,492
Scott: I think Pac-man jr.

770
00:46:10,553 --> 00:46:10,914
Scott: Is worse.

771
00:46:10,974 --> 00:46:11,496
Rym: Pac-man jr.

772
00:46:11,556 --> 00:46:12,179
Rym: Is not good.

773
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:15,407
Scott: I mean Counting actual Pac-man game.

774
00:46:15,467 --> 00:46:18,119
Scott: Okay, not like some 3d garbo Pac-man.

775
00:46:18,883 --> 00:46:19,526
Scott: That's not doesn't?

776
00:46:19,807 --> 00:46:21,254
Scott: I'm talking about 2d Pac-man's.

777
00:46:21,274 --> 00:46:22,400
Scott: where there's a there's a maze.

778
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,245
Rym: CEDX is real fucking good.

779
00:46:25,626 --> 00:46:26,047
Scott: Pac-man.

780
00:46:26,107 --> 00:46:28,153
Scott: CEDX 2 is not.

781
00:46:28,434 --> 00:46:29,978
Scott: it's not not it's not.

782
00:46:30,018 --> 00:46:30,700
Scott: no it's weird.

783
00:46:31,621 --> 00:46:34,773
Rym: Yeah, Pac-man CEDX is weird, but it's a good way.

784
00:46:34,893 --> 00:46:43,849
Scott: X plus is the best Pac-man Single-player yep, but miss Pac-man is the best like pure old pack your old one Yeah, but this is regular Pac-man, which you know.

785
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:44,451
Scott: it's like.

786
00:46:44,712 --> 00:46:46,218
Scott: how fun is regular Pac-man?

787
00:46:46,238 --> 00:46:52,920
Scott: pretty fun It's okay, it's but it's like hey if you have this you can play regular Pac-man on your switch if you're in a Pac-man mood.

788
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,967
Scott: Yeah, and I wish they would put Pac-man.

789
00:46:54,987 --> 00:46:56,252
Scott: you can turn off plus on.

790
00:46:56,292 --> 00:46:58,380
Scott: you can turn off the screen by the game again.

791
00:46:58,541 --> 00:46:59,589
Rym: You can turn off the kill screen.

792
00:46:59,609 --> 00:47:00,980
Rym: Just keep going past the last level.

793
00:47:02,369 --> 00:47:04,767
Rym: hmm Galaga is also older than Dig Dug.

794
00:47:05,028 --> 00:47:06,072
Scott: Oh, it's Galaga.

795
00:47:06,192 --> 00:47:06,915
Scott: I love Galaga.

796
00:47:07,096 --> 00:47:10,010
Rym: the thing is I love Galaga But I actually like Galaga 88 way more.

797
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:11,799
Scott: well Galaga 88 is a better game.

798
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:15,272
Scott: Yeah for if you have modern sensibilities, but Galaga is like.

799
00:47:15,313 --> 00:47:17,200
Scott: so Galaga is actually the sequel to Galaxian.

800
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,255
Scott: Galaxian is really a bad game.

801
00:47:19,416 --> 00:47:21,288
Scott: Yeah It's like this Galaxian.

802
00:47:21,308 --> 00:47:29,795
Scott: you have this grid of bad guys that are sort of meh and Occasionally they come flying down at you, and it's really kind of static and you shoot like pew pew right.

803
00:47:30,156 --> 00:47:37,220
Scott: Galaga is really dynamic Like you know guys are swooping down and swirling and flying and you can get captured.

804
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:42,860
Scott: There's a lot of there's actually significant complexity like do you let yourself get captured and then get the double-shit?

805
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,183
Scott: but now you're more vulnerable and interesting.

806
00:47:45,223 --> 00:47:50,410
Scott: different kinds of bad guys come in and you get the bonus round and the Positioning and it's like in the bag.

807
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:52,740
Scott: I shoot a ton of fucking missiles at you all over the place.

808
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:55,651
Scott: It's like Galaga is serious serious business.

809
00:47:56,072 --> 00:47:58,100
Scott: Galaga 88 is a really fancy Galaga.

810
00:47:58,220 --> 00:47:58,722
Scott: It's not like.

811
00:47:58,742 --> 00:48:02,957
Rym: it's also Galaga 88 technically came out according to Wikipedia in 87.

812
00:48:02,957 --> 00:48:08,022
Scott: Yeah, probably I think there's also a Galaga 90 for the Cerbographic 16.

813
00:48:08,022 --> 00:48:10,831
Rym: yeah, but anyway, so that's the two Galaga's their Galaga.

814
00:48:11,131 --> 00:48:14,020
Scott: Yeah, Dig Dug my boy Dig Dug is Dig Dug.

815
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:14,985
Scott: It's the best game on.

816
00:48:15,106 --> 00:48:25,280
Rym: so when I got when I got this thing I didn't I just played Dig Dug and I've been playing Dig Dug a bunch recently the third time I played Dig Dug ever since I bought this thing.

817
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:29,420
Scott: This is the best portable Dig Dug because I don't think before now, right?

818
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:29,922
Scott: It's like there's.

819
00:48:29,962 --> 00:48:33,340
Scott: you've been able to get Dig Dug on like lots of portable consoles, right?

820
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:36,391
Scott: But I don't think there has been a pure emu.

821
00:48:36,411 --> 00:48:41,200
Scott: there might have been on a PSP or a Vita or something But I don't know because I don't pay attention to those things.

822
00:48:42,481 --> 00:48:52,567
Scott: There has never been a pure, you know Emulated perfect Dig Dug legally released on a portable console I think before now that I'm aware of.

823
00:48:52,928 --> 00:48:56,240
Rym: but Dig Dug is one of our favorite old arcade games up there with Rampart.

824
00:48:56,421 --> 00:48:59,175
Rym: We just love the hell out of it and we're both pretty good at it.

825
00:48:59,195 --> 00:49:01,898
Rym: We're not like world-class Obviously not but we're pretty good.

826
00:49:02,482 --> 00:49:04,009
Scott: So the better than a normal person.

827
00:49:04,049 --> 00:49:12,277
Rym: I literally played it three times and on the third time I got the 37th highest score on like the leaderboards and as of today, I've only dropped to 42nd.

828
00:49:13,361 --> 00:49:15,831
Scott: I saw I checked the leaderboard on my switch yesterday.

829
00:49:15,851 --> 00:49:16,654
Scott: It said you were 50th.

830
00:49:17,056 --> 00:49:20,872
Scott: I guess I dropped a little further But anyway, I'm like I'm a hundred something.

831
00:49:21,274 --> 00:49:23,940
Rym: I can't beat the score I got the third time I played it.

832
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:26,250
Rym: I played it a lot more than three times since then.

833
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:35,580
Scott: the problem is I've learned how to get high scores and Dig Dug like Drop two rocks get the vegetable try to kill guys with rocks But so but the real pro mode is kiting three enemies simultaneously.

834
00:49:36,122 --> 00:49:42,846
Scott: I can do that as long as I'm not stuck on the bottom left corner of the screen where I usually am because that's where Meanwhile I was playing with.

835
00:49:42,906 --> 00:49:47,280
Rym: Judith was hanging out and we're just playing Dig Dug and we realized something really horrifying about this game.

836
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:51,714
Rym: It's the way you kill these monsters is really awful.

837
00:49:51,774 --> 00:49:53,380
Scott: You harpoon them and then you inflate you.

838
00:49:54,542 --> 00:49:55,928
Rym: It's like inflation girl.

839
00:49:55,989 --> 00:49:58,300
Scott: It's awful, but they're basically inflatable monsters.

840
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:02,840
Scott: They're in they're not like but like that's every lady real slow and watch with these the sprites.

841
00:50:03,161 --> 00:50:06,592
Rym: They just like explode out of their stomach like really horribly.

842
00:50:06,752 --> 00:50:08,177
Scott: Yeah, it's like this the North Star.

843
00:50:08,378 --> 00:50:09,140
Rym: Yeah, basically.

844
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,851
Rym: But uh Dig Dug is super great.

845
00:50:11,892 --> 00:50:12,857
Rym: I love the hell out of it.

846
00:50:13,099 --> 00:50:18,163
Rym: and If you've never played Dig Dug and you buy this for Pac-man first Dig Dug.

847
00:50:18,584 --> 00:50:22,317
Rym: Dig Dug and Galaga 88 are probably the two best games other than Pac-man verse.

848
00:50:22,538 --> 00:50:23,140
Rym: on this thing.

849
00:50:23,421 --> 00:50:24,307
Scott: Yeah, we have she.

850
00:50:24,328 --> 00:50:26,180
Scott: we've done an old GeekNights just about Dig Dug.

851
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:27,003
Scott: So you can go find that.

852
00:50:27,144 --> 00:50:31,140
Rym: you can go find that if you want, uh Tower of Deraga is horrible and you just don't play It.

853
00:50:31,221 --> 00:50:31,682
Rym: well, okay.

854
00:50:31,702 --> 00:50:36,276
Scott: So Tower of Deraga is one of these games that like steals quarters from children.

855
00:50:36,697 --> 00:50:42,320
Scott: Yes, that is true But the thing with the game is that it's like it's so close to being good.

856
00:50:42,481 --> 00:50:46,580
Scott: It's just like it's oldness ruins it if someone would just update Tower of Deraga a little bit.

857
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:47,764
Scott: It could be great and the way it.

858
00:50:47,784 --> 00:50:48,929
Scott: basically it's a game.

859
00:50:48,949 --> 00:50:51,960
Scott: whether the maze million levels as it has a million levels.

860
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:52,946
Scott: There's a maze and it.

861
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:55,120
Scott: the maze is one screen, but it's kind of long.

862
00:50:55,160 --> 00:51:02,804
Scott: So you have to scroll left and right to see the whole thing And you're a dude with a sword and you basically hold the sword Controls.

863
00:51:02,904 --> 00:51:11,732
Scott: you hold the sword button to make the sword come out and you walk into a bad guy to kill it and you let Go the sword button to put the sword away and have the shield out and have the shield out right.

864
00:51:12,334 --> 00:51:16,740
Scott: and and the first level It's like this green slimes and okay.

865
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:24,640
Scott: so you walk around and you stab I think five green slimes and that makes a treasure chest appear and in that treasure chest is The pickaxe which you used to bust open a wall.

866
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:25,925
Scott: You need this thing.

867
00:51:26,026 --> 00:51:28,075
Scott: if you don't get this in level one, you are so boned.

868
00:51:28,095 --> 00:51:29,280
Scott: You can't get it after level one.

869
00:51:29,722 --> 00:51:32,420
Scott: Like then you have to get a key and then go in the exit door.

870
00:51:33,565 --> 00:51:36,540
Scott: If you grab the key, you can't walk past the exit door anymore.

871
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:41,500
Scott: So I hope the mate you don't mess up and like kill the wrong slimes in the wrong order or anything.

872
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:45,552
Rym: This is one of those old games where like if you don't get a certain item at a certain point You'll get to the end of the game.

873
00:51:45,612 --> 00:51:46,160
Rym: You just can't win.

874
00:51:46,241 --> 00:51:47,071
Rym: You gotta go all the way back.

875
00:51:47,111 --> 00:51:52,796
Scott: in level two You have to kill I think two black slimes to get the most important item, which is the walk faster item.

876
00:51:53,258 --> 00:51:56,120
Scott: in level three I think you can get an item that gives you like an extra life.

877
00:51:56,200 --> 00:52:02,423
Scott: It's not as important but it's like so on and so forth and the instructions actually tell you how to get the item to appear In each level.

878
00:52:02,523 --> 00:52:06,700
Scott: Yeah, you can be really game with a fact, but really the it's in the game.

879
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:12,525
Scott: It gives you the manual but the really the pickaxe and if you don't get the pickaxe and the walk faster You're done.

880
00:52:12,827 --> 00:52:19,394
Scott: because the main problem with this game is That there's this fucking timer in every level like gauntlet and you have to get.

881
00:52:19,414 --> 00:52:31,400
Scott: if you don't get to the exit before the timer Horrible bad guys appear that are super that chase you down if I can kill you and there's not much you can do about them And it just eats your fucking quarters If someone just made this game more elegant and remove

882
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:31,661
Rym: Yeah,

883
00:52:32,163 --> 00:52:32,625
Scott: and things.

884
00:52:32,665 --> 00:52:34,273
Scott: sometimes you can get boned by the maze.

885
00:52:34,293 --> 00:52:37,918
Scott: like the maze is just arranged in a bad way So it takes super long to get to the exit.

886
00:52:38,622 --> 00:52:39,626
Scott: It's just basically just it.

887
00:52:39,787 --> 00:52:45,440
Rym: this game is why it's like one of those old games from an era like those Like those sort of earth or whatever games.

888
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:51,720
Scott: Someone just polished Tower of Druaga to make it not evil and not some arcade quarter muncher.

889
00:52:52,225 --> 00:52:56,331
Scott: It could actually be kind of fun But no such thing is the case.

890
00:52:56,371 --> 00:52:56,893
Rym: is this good.

891
00:52:56,933 --> 00:52:58,620
Rym: This just got replaced by roguelikes.

892
00:52:59,123 --> 00:53:01,516
Scott: Yeah, I think just play a roguelike instead is right.

893
00:53:01,717 --> 00:53:04,612
Rym: sky kid Which I never played before is way more fun than I expected.

894
00:53:04,672 --> 00:53:06,058
Rym: actually like sky kid a lot.

895
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:07,644
Scott: sky kids Okay, but it's so it's a.

896
00:53:07,885 --> 00:53:08,768
Rym: it's kind of hard.

897
00:53:08,788 --> 00:53:12,140
Rym: They still write to left shmup, which is annoying.

898
00:53:12,421 --> 00:53:16,995
Rym: Yeah, I want to go left to right based on World War one like a style combat.

899
00:53:17,136 --> 00:53:24,423
Rym: the way you got a fly You got a cool thing is you've got to take off and land and you can do a little loopy loopy loop and shoot while You're looping.

900
00:53:24,644 --> 00:53:31,100
Rym: Yeah, so like the dog fighting is actually like kind of complex Like you can't turn around and shoot backwards though and a lot of guys come from behind.

901
00:53:31,181 --> 00:53:32,754
Rym: Well, you can do a loop and shoot while you're looping.

902
00:53:32,936 --> 00:53:33,279
Scott: Good luck.

903
00:53:34,401 --> 00:53:37,592
Rym: So yeah, there's a high skill component like there's cool stuff going on, but it's got.

904
00:53:37,613 --> 00:53:39,620
Scott: this mechanic component means hardest boss.

905
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:48,573
Rym: Independent of that there'll be a target and you just get a picture of it and it'll appear at some point during each map and At some point during each map before the target.

906
00:53:48,735 --> 00:53:49,459
Rym: There'll be a bomb.

907
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:54,698
Scott: you have to pick up that bomb which means you have to go down near the ground where this dangerous because trees will just kill you.

908
00:53:55,079 --> 00:54:01,446
Rym: and The only way to launch the bomb is you'd start a loop and you'll like launch the bomb while you do the loop meaning while You're carrying the bomb.

909
00:54:01,667 --> 00:54:03,298
Rym: You're slow and heavy and can't do the loop anymore.

910
00:54:03,318 --> 00:54:05,163
Rym: and It's got.

911
00:54:05,585 --> 00:54:11,892
Rym: basically it's got a lot of the feels of like an old chop lifter game Mmm, and I liked chop lifter a lot.

912
00:54:12,053 --> 00:54:13,620
Scott: chop lifters a lot more dynamic though.

913
00:54:13,981 --> 00:54:16,692
Rym: Yeah, this is simpler, but I had a lot of fun with it.

914
00:54:16,933 --> 00:54:18,500
Rym: and also the that art of the Eagle.

915
00:54:19,003 --> 00:54:21,260
Rym: I love that Eagles face cuz he's just so like why?

916
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,349
Rym: Sure, that's like a Waluigi face.

917
00:54:23,409 --> 00:54:23,792
Scott: It's an oak.

918
00:54:23,872 --> 00:54:27,340
Scott: It's not the worst game on here But you know, it's not like you're gonna play that much of it.

919
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:28,440
Scott: It's an old cruddy arcade game.

920
00:54:28,681 --> 00:54:35,600
Scott: So rolling thunder rolling thunder - or just those like boring rolling thunder and rolling thunder - are boring elevator action.

921
00:54:35,841 --> 00:54:38,749
Scott: Crappy versions of elevator elevator action without the elevator.

922
00:54:38,969 --> 00:54:40,855
Scott: right elevator action is actually a good game.

923
00:54:41,075 --> 00:54:42,800
Scott: elevator action - is an incredible game.

924
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:45,778
Rym: They remind me of all those bad Sega port rolling thunder.

925
00:54:45,838 --> 00:54:59,740
Scott: rolling Thunder is elevator action but fucked up so that it's really annoying and unfun to play Because the bad guys just like you'll go into a door to hide and the bad guys just mill outside the door And you can't possibly exit because the bad guys don't move.

926
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:01,167
Scott: Oh, and what are you gonna do?

927
00:55:01,207 --> 00:55:03,680
Scott: get out and take a damage and then you get killed.

928
00:55:03,881 --> 00:55:07,140
Rym: The kinds of arcade games as a kid I'd like play once and never play again cuz I hated them.

929
00:55:07,361 --> 00:55:10,519
Scott: Yeah, it's you know, you're better off playing like sunset riders and playing this.

930
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:14,515
Rym: So tank force is actually reasonably fun as well.

931
00:55:14,635 --> 00:55:15,920
Scott: Force is a good game.

932
00:55:16,101 --> 00:55:18,700
Rym: It reminds me a little bit of that battle mode in advance.

933
00:55:19,521 --> 00:55:23,916
Rym: It's combat, but the controls are actually good, but the battle mode in advance wars DS as well.

934
00:55:23,936 --> 00:55:25,461
Scott: It doesn't really cheat you It's just.

935
00:55:25,642 --> 00:55:26,384
Scott: it's just fair.

936
00:55:26,444 --> 00:55:26,785
Scott: hard.

937
00:55:26,966 --> 00:55:29,795
Rym: protect your base kill the bad guys and the two players.

938
00:55:29,815 --> 00:55:31,645
Rym: seems like it's also pretty true player Is it?

939
00:55:31,665 --> 00:55:32,860
Scott: that's the one thing about this game?

940
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:35,691
Scott: Is that because the way the map is it's not like the game.

941
00:55:35,711 --> 00:55:37,578
Scott: get the game gets easier with two player.

942
00:55:37,618 --> 00:55:42,380
Scott: with one player It's kind of annoyingly hard because the bad guys are coming in from all these sides and you're just one tank.

943
00:55:42,421 --> 00:55:42,914
Scott: What can you do?

944
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:50,040
Scott: Yeah But if you have two players Playing co-op the way this is meant to be played this game gets real good or real fast and is that it's real fun?

945
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:50,784
Rym: I really like it.

946
00:55:50,924 --> 00:55:58,319
Scott: Yeah, imagine it combat, but instead of shooting each other You're protecting one area of the map and a million bad guys come in from all sides and there's two of you.

947
00:55:58,721 --> 00:56:10,993
Scott: But the controls are really good and you can get a lot of upgrades to get better shots and stuff and the environment is destructible, yep, so Splatterhouse is kind of notable because that was I think I'm pretty sure that game came out.

948
00:56:11,033 --> 00:56:12,037
Rym: I'm Sega guys.

949
00:56:12,198 --> 00:56:14,347
Scott: Splatterhouse I remember being a Genesis game.

950
00:56:14,407 --> 00:56:15,190
Scott: I don't remember it being.

951
00:56:15,371 --> 00:56:16,174
Scott: I think it might have been mad.

952
00:56:16,697 --> 00:56:17,520
Rym: Holy shit.

953
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,734
Rym: Do you not understand if you're younger than us?

954
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:20,700
Rym: how?

955
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:29,240
Scott: Controversial Splatterhouse was right because this is a game that actually showed like when you would chainsaw Like ghostly bad guys and they would get guts everywhere.

956
00:56:29,943 --> 00:56:37,051
Rym: It wasn't quite a giant fetus hanging from a womb at the end of the game Like it was a horror game that showed horror imagery.

957
00:56:37,071 --> 00:56:38,155
Scott: You're basically Jason.

958
00:56:38,235 --> 00:56:39,339
Scott: You had a Jason mask.

959
00:56:39,439 --> 00:56:45,640
Rym: Yep The mask of power even though it's basically a Jojo's mask, even though you're a good guy and not a horrible guys.

960
00:56:45,841 --> 00:56:49,280
Rym: Well, no, you're a good guy who gets possessed by the mask of horror.

961
00:56:49,583 --> 00:56:51,340
Rym: That's some ancient like Aztec thing.

962
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,043
Rym: But you go.

963
00:56:52,063 --> 00:56:55,860
Scott: you go into this mansion of evil to save your girlfriend who got captured by horror.

964
00:56:56,081 --> 00:56:57,209
Rym: Yeah, it has a bad ending.

965
00:56:57,229 --> 00:56:57,995
Rym: You can't save her.

966
00:56:58,055 --> 00:56:58,720
Rym: It's bad news.

967
00:56:58,901 --> 00:57:06,490
Scott: Yeah, everything in the mansion is hard and you go through basically horrifyingly Murdering and chopping up all these other evil things.

968
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:08,900
Rym: It's actually more fun than I expected.

969
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:11,384
Scott: No, Splatterhouse was actually a legit good game.

970
00:57:11,765 --> 00:57:14,470
Scott: It's a lot like I don't know how many people know this game.

971
00:57:16,101 --> 00:57:17,727
Scott: Oh, is it what the hell's the name of it?

972
00:57:18,651 --> 00:57:19,835
Scott: Is it Astya next?

973
00:57:20,738 --> 00:57:22,384
Rym: Oh, yeah Really?

974
00:57:22,404 --> 00:57:23,531
Scott: Is that what is called?

975
00:57:23,552 --> 00:57:24,095
Scott: Let me look it up.

976
00:57:24,156 --> 00:57:24,599
Scott: Hold on.

977
00:57:25,541 --> 00:57:33,106
Scott: Yes, Astia X as G and X is a game for the NES where you're this giant dude and give a Greek guy and you have.

978
00:57:33,266 --> 00:57:43,658
Scott: you're really kind of slow and your attacks are really slow and you're really big and your side scrolling and there's all these bad guys that are really fast all over the place and you had to beat them all.

979
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:48,856
Scott: and Splatter house is really really similar to that only better cuz unlike double dragon.

980
00:57:48,876 --> 00:57:51,339
Rym: You can't move up and down It's just left and right.

981
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:58,580
Rym: But even though you only have sort of punching kick and jump There's a lot of combinations and items and things that make it skill based.

982
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:00,849
Scott: It's really actually quite similar.

983
00:58:00,909 --> 00:58:03,600
Scott: you people love your fucking Dark Souls garbage, which I don't like.

984
00:58:03,801 --> 00:58:07,980
Scott: This is like 2d Dark Souls and insert of the combat way.

985
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:12,140
Scott: There's no exploring and that kind of stuff, but it's like in terms of the action aspect.

986
00:58:12,261 --> 00:58:18,880
Scott: It's like oh for this bad guy You need to back up a little bit and then get in on him and for this bad guy You got a crouch and whack him a bunch.

987
00:58:19,221 --> 00:58:22,371
Scott: There's yet to figure out a different way to approach all the different enemies.

988
00:58:22,451 --> 00:58:27,118
Scott: combat wise because you don't get a lot of health Get killed real fast.

989
00:58:28,083 --> 00:58:34,100
Rym: Yeah, but it's a piece of history But it's more fun than most of the other like I'd play it again before I would ever play tower of drive.

990
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:37,299
Scott: Yes, bladder house is actually a decent game like no one, you know.

991
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:47,645
Scott: That's the thing is that if you look at history when of people of controversial, you know video games like Mortal Kombat and stuff The only games that had these Controversies around there.

992
00:58:47,665 --> 00:58:54,380
Scott: There are plenty of other horrible violent games But like custard's revenge wasn't in the news because no one could buy it and it wasn't actually a good game.

993
00:58:54,761 --> 00:59:03,123
Scott: the games like splatter house immortal combat became controversial because a bunch of people were buying them because they were a fucking good Sad nap.

994
00:59:03,163 --> 00:59:03,706
Rym: go museum.

995
00:59:03,726 --> 00:59:06,378
Scott: Like if you want to switch there weren't any other games talk about.

996
00:59:06,418 --> 00:59:06,840
Rym: no, that's it.

997
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:07,519
Rym: That's all there.

998
00:59:07,784 --> 00:59:08,537
Scott: I feel like you missed one.

999
00:59:08,921 --> 00:59:11,930
Rym: Pac-man Galaga dig dug top dragga sky kid rolling thunder.

1000
00:59:11,970 --> 00:59:14,638
Rym: Galaga 88 splatter house rolling thunder to tank force.

1001
00:59:14,838 --> 00:59:15,460
Rym: pac-man verse.

1002
00:59:15,722 --> 00:59:17,415
Rym: Alright, there's nothing else on there.

1003
00:59:17,576 --> 00:59:19,284
Scott: Okay, but yeah It's I don't know if you're like.

1004
00:59:19,304 --> 00:59:24,804
Scott: I wouldn't pay full price for this right now on your switch unless you unless you're a fan Of one of these games.

1005
00:59:24,824 --> 00:59:27,676
Scott: right unless you really want to play one of these because you can get the.

1006
00:59:27,716 --> 00:59:31,119
Scott: let someone else buy pet Buy it and play pac-man verse for free with them.

1007
00:59:31,762 --> 00:59:36,800
Scott: But if you're the kind of person like me who's gonna try to you know, register some dig dug high scores when you're bored.

1008
00:59:38,004 --> 00:59:42,740
Scott: You know, I basically bought this and Magical drop and those are like my quick play switch games.

1009
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:47,220
Scott: I don't think I'm gonna buy any more quick play switch games unless something really great comes out on there.

1010
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,228
Rym: Oh, yeah, and there's a tiny feature that's really useful.

1011
00:59:49,529 --> 00:59:52,400
Rym: You can rotate the screen to any orientation.

1012
00:59:53,003 --> 00:59:55,677
Scott: Oh, yeah, cuz a lot of these games there are vertical arcade games like.

1013
00:59:55,717 --> 01:00:02,300
Rym: so Doug I play dig-dug holding a controller and I set it on the table like your switch sideways like a cocktail cabinet.

1014
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:05,253
Scott: It actually lets you rotate it 90 degrees in any direction.

1015
01:00:05,273 --> 01:00:10,173
Scott: So there's four different orientations Even though the two are which is just example of if you play.

1016
01:00:10,193 --> 01:00:14,127
Rym: if you poke around you'll see in the options There's so much polish to this.

1017
01:00:14,468 --> 01:00:16,674
Scott: Mm-hmm that it's an emulator.

1018
01:00:16,694 --> 01:00:25,449
Scott: It gives you all the features that you need For these games and not any other of the features that are in emulators, but honestly, it's worth paying full price for it Right now just because of pac-man first.

1019
01:00:25,469 --> 01:00:27,120
Rym: pretend you're buying pac-man first.

1020
01:00:27,441 --> 01:00:28,746
Rym: Yeah, cuz that game is worth.

1021
01:00:28,807 --> 01:00:30,172
Scott: how much did we pay for pac-man first?

1022
01:00:30,232 --> 01:00:30,795
Scott: on the GameCube?

1023
01:00:30,855 --> 01:00:30,996
Scott: fuck.

1024
01:00:31,056 --> 01:00:35,480
Rym: if I remember that was like Including 14 years ago the cost of link cables and everything else.

1025
01:00:35,601 --> 01:00:43,460
Rym: It was 2000 and then I gotta have friends So I gotta buy three hookers to come over and I gotta buy a house and I gotta buy food electricity.

1026
01:00:50,891 --> 01:00:53,138
