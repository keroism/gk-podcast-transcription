147
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:35,246
Scott: it was announced today Our new month the guy who made Zelda put up a video on the Nintendo YouTube channel and they announced that the Zelda game that's coming out for the the Switch the what's it called?

Scott: Uh, I mean, it's not great.

152
00:08:52,178 --> 00:08:52,499
Scott: It's a DLC.

153
00:08:52,901 --> 00:08:54,739
Scott: They're trying to get more money out of you like they do.

154
00:08:54,941 --> 00:08:55,362
Scott: I mean, I'm not.

155
00:08:55,523 --> 00:08:57,833
Scott: it's just like every other Nintendo thing and that they chart.

156
00:08:57,873 --> 00:09:00,405
Scott: they want us milk you a bunch of monies That's overpriced.

157
00:09:00,446 --> 00:09:11,397
Rym: I'm not opposed to the Theory or the like hypothetical of DLC is a concept But in practice tends to be kind of a serious.

158
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:12,060
Scott: how it's gonna work?

159
00:09:12,622 --> 00:09:14,652
Scott: You're gonna get your Nintendo switch on March 3rd.

172
00:10:07,882 --> 00:10:09,690
Scott: Other people are gonna have to pay that pack separately.

173
00:10:09,771 --> 00:10:11,780
Rym: I'll pack implies more packs down the road, right?

174
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:16,500
Scott: So you're getting pack number one in the summer, which will include a cave of trials.

175
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,140
Rym: So already there have been things that hold on.

176
00:10:20,981 --> 00:10:23,350
Scott: You're like you're like not let me finish all the stuff you're getting here.

177
00:10:23,491 --> 00:10:24,113
Scott: I'm already.

178
00:10:24,314 --> 00:10:28,249
Scott: it's like this as a whole bunch of stuff You're getting and you're like answering at the first thing.

179
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:28,812
Scott: All right.

180
00:10:28,832 --> 00:10:29,153
Scott: How do you know?

181
00:10:29,193 --> 00:10:30,860
Scott: The next thing isn't like a real bar of gold.

182
00:10:31,943 --> 00:10:32,205
Rym: All right.

183
00:10:32,447 --> 00:10:32,851
Rym: All right.

184
00:10:32,952 --> 00:10:33,093
Rym: Is it?

185
00:10:33,134 --> 00:10:33,800
Scott: what is the next thing?

186
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,005
Scott: I'm gonna tell you all the things.

187
00:10:35,045 --> 00:10:36,834
Scott: then you can say it's not enough stuff.

188
00:10:36,894 --> 00:10:37,376
Scott: because guess what?

189
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:38,119
Scott: It's not enough stuff.

190
00:10:41,061 --> 00:10:49,666
Scott: In the summer you get three things the cave of trials the hard mode and the mysterious Additional map feature.

191
00:10:49,686 --> 00:10:56,540
Scott: Oh and then in the holidays Right, so you're paying 20 bucks in March for something you're getting in December.

192
00:10:56,941 --> 00:10:58,787
Rym: Why don't I just pay 20 bucks in December?

193
00:10:58,827 --> 00:11:09,064
Scott: You're getting a new original story a new dungeon and Additional challenges, yeah, whatever those are Huh?

194
00:11:09,285 --> 00:11:10,009
Scott: So you're paying it.

195
00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:12,020
Scott: So you're basically it's like a season pass deal.

196
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:17,437
Scott: It's like instead of paying 50 bucks for your Zelda pay 70 and you'll get more Zelda later.

197
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:19,310
Scott: now on the one hand wait There's two packs though.

198
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,181
Rym: So it's gonna be 90.

199
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,606
Scott: No, you pay 20 bucks for everything.

200
00:11:22,667 --> 00:11:26,320
Scott: for pack 1 and pack in March you pay 20 bucks and that gets you all this shit.

201
00:11:26,722 --> 00:11:31,556
Scott: So if I don't pre-order it though, if you don't pay the 20 bucks in March You might have to buy the packs like separately.

202
00:11:31,596 --> 00:11:31,979
Scott: Who knows?

203
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,302
Rym: All right.

204
00:11:33,463 --> 00:11:34,729
Rym: See my worry already.

205
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:40,188
Rym: Is that Zelda games have had Especially the Gameboy ones like the mobile mobile.

206
00:11:40,228 --> 00:11:44,479
Rym: the the portable ones have had caves of fight stuff.

207
00:11:45,061 --> 00:11:48,672
Rym: We're often shall I say dare to use the word on the only.

208
00:11:48,752 --> 00:11:53,307
Scott: the only thing on this list of stuff that you actually want Is new original story and new dungeon.

209
00:11:53,387 --> 00:11:55,434
Scott: every and maybe new hard mode of a story.

210
00:11:55,474 --> 00:11:55,755
Rym: Is this?

211
00:11:55,856 --> 00:11:58,046
Rym: is this oh my god I lost my chicken.

212
00:11:58,086 --> 00:12:03,900
Rym: you get the chicken and the guy says a line, you know It's at least one whole dungeons worth.

213
00:12:04,781 --> 00:12:07,631
Rym: Yeah, but are we talking a dungeon like the dungeons Zelda 3?

214
00:12:07,631 --> 00:12:10,320
Rym: are we talking a dungeon like what kind of dungeons?

215
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,105
Scott: No one knows.

216
00:12:11,145 --> 00:12:12,540
Scott: it just says new dungeon, right?

217
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:18,460
Scott: But the point is is that it's a good thing in that I've played like every Zelda game except stupid Majora's Mask.

218
00:12:20,602 --> 00:12:26,220
Scott: And what happens is you play it you have so much fun Like you actually remember to keep playing it when you come home from work the next day.

219
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:33,600
Scott: Oh, and then you beat it and once you beat it, you're done son You just put that shit in the binder of discs or you stop playing it and that's it.

220
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,517
Rym: And you definitely don't a hundred percent because a lot of you never are.

221
00:12:36,537 --> 00:12:36,960
Rym: not that fun?

222
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,904
Scott: You never open that.

223
00:12:37,944 --> 00:12:39,530
Scott: you never launched that game again.

224
00:12:39,631 --> 00:12:40,796
Scott: Once you beat the final boss.

225
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:41,880
Scott: It's over, right?

226
00:12:42,021 --> 00:12:43,689
Scott: Except for it's like Zelda 1 right?

227
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:46,040
Rym: Yeah, maybe Zelda 3 I'll play like a few years.

228
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,667
Scott: You only replay the greatest Zelda's.

229
00:12:47,687 --> 00:12:48,972
Scott: you don't replay these other Zelda's.

230
00:12:49,012 --> 00:12:52,945
Scott: Yeah, like Zelda 2 like for example Skyward sword, right?

231
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:53,709
Scott: It was great.

232
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:54,372
Scott: I played it.

233
00:12:54,433 --> 00:12:57,234
Scott: But as soon as it was done is done I never played that again in my whole life.

234
00:12:57,314 --> 00:12:57,860
Scott: Yeah, right.

235
00:12:58,362 --> 00:13:03,822
Scott: Maybe when I'm really old if I completely forget it, maybe we had nothing really nothing better to do Unlikely.

236
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:13,139
Scott: Yeah, so if I'm paying 50 bucks for the Zelda, I'm Expecting it to be Twilight, you know a skyward sword right play it I beat it and then I'm done with it.

237
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,934
Scott: But if they give me a new dungeon, right?

238
00:13:15,974 --> 00:13:16,497
Scott: There's other stuff.

239
00:13:16,517 --> 00:13:17,060
Scott: who gives a shit?

240
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,140
Scott: But it is a new dungeon that makes me turn it on again.

241
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:23,559
Rym: I would turn on almost any Zelda game that I had beaten if there was like because you're not getting it.

242
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,660
Scott: Yeah, we're not gonna see another new complete Zelda game for like five more years.

243
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:33,968
Scott: But if they add stuff to the existing one so that I bust out again and get more Zelda That's again, you know.

244
00:13:34,149 --> 00:13:35,499
Scott: who can say that's not good?

245
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,085
Rym: Well, cuz I want that of.

246
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:41,520
Rym: imagine if the the good Castlevania is that they haven't made in a long time.

247
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:47,396
Rym: If I could pay 20 bucks and there's just another right side up castle on top of the upside-down castle.

248
00:13:47,817 --> 00:13:48,800
Rym: keep going, right?

249
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,391
Scott: But it's like, you know is 20 bucks too much and not enough?

250
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:55,180
Scott: and also it's like are you gonna make me ever?

251
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,067
Scott: It's 20 bucks to get me packs forever.

252
00:13:57,188 --> 00:13:59,136
Scott: Or is that holiday pack gonna be the end of it?

253
00:13:59,236 --> 00:14:04,956
Scott: or I'm sure Am I gonna debate 20 bucks in 2018 or you're not gonna put out any more stuff.

254
00:14:04,976 --> 00:14:06,020
Scott: It's a one-time thing.

255
00:14:06,121 --> 00:14:07,258
Scott: It's like how is this gonna go?

256
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,660
Scott: There's not enough info to evaluate whether this is okay or not.

257
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,158
Rym: Okay, right not opposed to this.

258
00:14:15,241 --> 00:14:20,676
Scott: Maybe I should cancel my Zelda pre-order and wait and then in 2018 by the game of the year edition.

259
00:14:20,876 --> 00:14:21,859
Scott: that includes everything.

260
00:14:21,939 --> 00:14:25,600
Scott: However Well, that would be the normal strategy in steam world.

261
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,569
Scott: Nintendo never cuts the price in their games.

262
00:14:28,609 --> 00:14:31,941
Scott: This Zelda game is gonna be 50 bucks in 2020.

263
00:14:31,941 --> 00:14:33,970
Scott: It probably will go down to 40 bucks in 2020.

264
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:35,618
Scott: It's like oh, it's.

265
00:14:35,658 --> 00:14:38,060
Scott: you know The reprint discount edition.

266
00:14:39,466 --> 00:14:42,820
Rym: Good games were the same price until they were out of stock.

267
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,864
Scott: So it's like you really got.

268
00:14:44,004 --> 00:14:47,719
Scott: you know, you don't have that option of wait for the $10 includes everything.

269
00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:48,100
Scott: edition.

270
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,150
Scott: It's like your choices are pay the 70 pay the 50 don't play.

271
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:56,410
Scott: or if you wait Who knows what'll even happen if you wait.

272
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:59,183
Rym: so mystery mystery land Like I'm.

273
00:14:59,223 --> 00:15:03,597
Rym: I don't take a principled stance against this stuff because look at uh, like Adobe software selling

274
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:04,500
Scott: your real game here

275
00:15:04,962 --> 00:15:13,353
Rym: But I'm happy to pay a monthly fee for software that is continuously updated Like just regularly gets updates for as long as I keep paying

276
00:15:13,494 --> 00:15:14,860
Scott: if it's significant updates.

277
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:16,144
Scott: But is this?

278
00:15:16,285 --> 00:15:20,500
Rym: but the question is is it worth 20 updates are only one of them is interesting.

279
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:25,460
Scott: I don't like three chests if you like you were playing Super Nintendo Zelda the best Zelda?

280
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:28,933
Scott: Yeah, right, you know that game cost 50 bucks in 1990, whatever.

281
00:15:28,953 --> 00:15:30,880
Scott: Yep, four five something like that.

282
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:34,460
Rym: I would still pay 20 bucks a quarter to this day if that just kept expanding.

283
00:15:34,641 --> 00:15:35,343
Scott: I'm just saying so.

284
00:15:35,905 --> 00:15:38,835
Scott: at that time you beat it when you're a kid on your Super Nintendo.

285
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:39,999
Scott: you began in the end.

286
00:15:40,562 --> 00:15:45,000
Scott: Would you then immediate immediately have shelled out $20?

287
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,513
Scott: For one more dungeon if it was the same size as like any other dungeon.

288
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:49,838
Rym: I got like one game a month.

289
00:15:51,381 --> 00:15:54,715
Rym: My parents would not give me 20 bucks just to make one game last longer.

290
00:15:54,755 --> 00:15:55,579
Rym: They'd say play it again.

291
00:15:56,809 --> 00:16:01,680
Scott: so You know if you're playing Zelda, would you pay 20 bucks per dungeon, you know?

292
00:16:02,701 --> 00:16:03,704
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

293
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:08,380
Scott: I really love it when there's more dungeons, but am I gonna pay 20 bucks per dungeon per year?

294
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,383
Rym: Here's the other problem.

295
00:16:09,825 --> 00:16:17,087
Rym: Every Zelda game has its scope of interaction like I'm being that dungeon in a day.

296
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:20,180
Scott: I'm coming home from work and the dungeon will be done before I go to bed.

297
00:16:20,525 --> 00:16:21,842
Scott: Is that worth $20?

298
00:16:21,842 --> 00:16:28,247
Rym: But any given Zelda game to like the universe of things that are possible in a given Zelda game is Limited with humble bundle right now.

299
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:30,574
Scott: Look at all what it gives you for the humble freedom bundle for $30.

300
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:35,010
Scott: Yeah Way more than one night of it.

301
00:16:35,211 --> 00:16:37,420
Scott: I mean, I love a Zelda dungeon, but do I love it that much?

302
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:41,960
Rym: Well, look at Zelda 3 or look at the most recent, you know, the Zelda 3 remake the portable one.

303
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:44,828
Rym: There's only so many mechanics in that game.

304
00:16:44,888 --> 00:16:51,328
Rym: unless you start drastically changing the game you run out of novel dungeons Like you run out of.

305
00:16:51,368 --> 00:16:53,379
Rym: there's only so many puzzles you can put in a Zelda game.

306
00:16:54,103 --> 00:16:57,600
Scott: Push the rock throw the rock shoot the arrow through the fire.

307
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:03,740
Rym: Yeah Use some sort of hook or jump or movement to get over an obstacle that you previously couldn't get over.

308
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:08,500
Scott: Well, this Zelda game is supposed to be more open world ish and less linears and bigger.

309
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:11,339
Rym: So I can sail forever through an endless sea of nothing.

310
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,344
Scott: So we're gonna see what.

311
00:17:12,405 --> 00:17:15,900
Scott: we're gonna see the reality once it comes out, which is freakishly soon March 3rd.

312
00:17:16,181 --> 00:17:18,651
Scott: It's currently February 14th, and I've already pre-ordered it.

313
00:17:18,711 --> 00:17:20,900
Scott: and March 3rd, it'll be on my doorstep.

314
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,248
Rym: March 3rd, I will be in London.

315
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:26,380
Scott: All right, I guess you're not gonna be live streaming switch games with me.

316
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,502
Rym: No, not right away.

317
00:17:27,522 --> 00:17:28,165
Rym: And we got packs.

318
00:17:28,224 --> 00:17:30,050
Scott: I'm gonna be that's right March 3rd.

319
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,895
Scott: I'm live streaming switch stuff.

320
00:17:32,016 --> 00:17:33,520
Scott: Yeah, come on over.

321
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:38,973
Rym: All right, so it's tangential gaming news, but some time ago.

322
00:17:38,993 --> 00:17:41,380
Rym: I warned all of you the PewDiePie was a piece of shit.

323
00:17:41,521 --> 00:17:43,879
Scott: Well, I mean you could tell he was not a good person.

324
00:17:44,423 --> 00:17:47,560
Scott: Like you, you know, you're that guy ometer that you get from going to conventions.

325
00:17:47,822 --> 00:17:50,640
Scott: Yeah, pretty much most YouTube people are not good people.

326
00:17:51,563 --> 00:17:52,788
Scott: I mean it was now.

327
00:17:52,848 --> 00:17:58,514
Scott: I would never if you had asked me at any point in history Once I knew who he was is he good person?

328
00:17:58,555 --> 00:17:59,419
Scott: My answer would have been no.

329
00:17:59,721 --> 00:18:07,209
Scott: So it's interesting because and I kind of I kept that if I know what you know what I found out though Markiplier great guy is a good person.

330
00:18:07,229 --> 00:18:08,053
Scott: Yeah, that's right.

331
00:18:08,335 --> 00:18:09,380
Scott: mark upon that his fan.

332
00:18:09,481 --> 00:18:11,826
Scott: I'm never gonna watch his shit But markiplier is a good person.

333
00:18:11,846 --> 00:18:18,770
Rym: markiplier never set off my that guy meter But PewDiePie did within less than a second.

334
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:24,870
Rym: like the pre warning system went off like NORAD was like Ram You're about to see a link to a YouTube channel.

335
00:18:25,601 --> 00:18:26,784
Rym: Watch the fuck out.

336
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:31,660
Rym: Mmm, but I couldn't like say oh, he's a bad guy just because that guy went off.

337
00:18:31,881 --> 00:18:47,702
Rym: I can just ignore him but a while ago you might recall some time ago He started complaining publicly that YouTube or Google was Minimizing his channel to promote minorities Unfairly.

338
00:18:47,722 --> 00:18:49,910
Rym: Mm-hmm and nonsense like that.

339
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:50,392
Rym: Mm-hmm.

340
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,443
Rym: And that was when I publicly started saying no he's a bad dude.

341
00:18:53,825 --> 00:19:00,195
Rym: and now yeah, he's so bad that YouTube canceled his show and Disney severed their relationship with him.

342
00:19:00,215 --> 00:19:00,557
Rym: Mm-hmm.

343
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:04,433
Rym: So he's finally going over the deep end and he started.

344
00:19:04,554 --> 00:19:11,115
Rym: basically he's like he's Sharing a lot of white supremacist stuff like straight-up Nazi stuff.

345
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,520
Rym: Hmm is the story?

346
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:26,314
Scott: So, you know what is true though that if you look at cuz I actually pay attention to like the I follow YouTube creators On Twitter and I why you know, I see YouTube ads in the subway and yeah, dude I'm a member of the Internet creators guild.

347
00:19:26,355 --> 00:19:27,020
Rym: I get a nice letter.

348
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:34,900
Scott: But anyway, YouTube does do a lot of advertisements for channels that they want to promote like this existing big channels on YouTube.

349
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:40,777
Scott: you know YouTube creators and YouTube spends money to make ads promoting those people and YouTube itself.

350
00:19:40,797 --> 00:19:49,169
Scott: at the same time and Absolutely, they feature right Women way more often than men.

351
00:19:49,269 --> 00:19:52,240
Scott: good and not white people way more often than white people.

352
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:57,457
Scott: Fantastic and that's great because we need more not white dudes on YouTube.

353
00:19:57,497 --> 00:19:58,500
Scott: to make it less awful.

354
00:19:58,801 --> 00:19:59,785
Rym: I mean GeekNights, like.

355
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:03,740
Rym: we're literally two upper-middle-class white dudes doing this in our spare time.

356
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,732
Scott: It's um, I do not I'm Jewish a minority.

357
00:20:06,953 --> 00:20:08,077
Rym: Yeah, dude.

358
00:20:08,318 --> 00:20:11,869
Rym: I'm an atheist I'm the both aces for the most hated minority in America.

359
00:20:12,491 --> 00:20:19,579
Scott: Yeah, if only we were also Muslim Hey not white And didn't have penises.

360
00:20:21,062 --> 00:20:32,580
Rym: But yeah both and me we don't need an entry and PewDiePie also does not need much help especially considering I read this Fascinating essay and there's actually a SciShow like mini episode.

361
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:56,836
Rym: I think it was SciShow might have been the other ones but it was talking about how if you set up a system that emulates Twitter where any given node will randomly reach retweet like a hundredth of the things that sees a Small number of YouTube accounts of these Twitter accounts will become Massive and viral and the most popular things ever in that fake network of unintelligent actors just by

362
00:20:56,896 --> 00:20:57,137
Scott: math.

363
00:20:57,157 --> 00:20:58,400
Scott: Oh, it's true.

364
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,506
Scott: Yeah, cuz it's just by luck.

365
00:20:59,847 --> 00:21:02,360
Scott: Yeah, it'll keep retweeting popular things constantly.

366
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:10,229
Rym: Anything that gets shared by anyone has a slightly higher chance of getting re-shared again, and you have this Evolution right.

367
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:21,182
Scott: So instead of making an aggregator that learns and tries to curate you just make a million monkey Aggregators and one of the monkeys will be a terrific aggregator just by chance Yep,

368
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:37,439
Rym: and a lot of the early YouTube celebrities seemed to mostly have been created by that like that's that that interaction of YouTube had a Recommendation engine and one video got a little more popular than the other ones and the recommendation engine just got to a loop.

369
00:21:38,324 --> 00:21:40,560
Rym: Mmm, I've read a lot of papers talking about that.

370
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:46,200
Rym: It might be true, but fact remains white dudes don't need any help and PewDiePie's a piece of shit.

371
00:21:46,603 --> 00:21:54,197
Scott: Well, also a lot of those early YouTube specifically right people did things that the you know YouTube thing liked right.

372
00:21:54,217 --> 00:21:56,914
Scott: they posted videos Frequently and such and such.

373
00:21:57,015 --> 00:22:06,200
Rym: Yep So you might have noticed I'm live streaming all the time, but I don't leave them public But I'm playing a lot of overwatch still but I'm just solo queuing competitive.

374
00:22:06,903 --> 00:22:16,100
Rym: I got within like two games of platinum But I fell short and then I had a series of catastrophic games with these randos.

375
00:22:16,322 --> 00:22:18,620
Scott: I mean, you know same thing when I played rocket League, right?

376
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:24,463
Scott: Yeah, you get on a streak where you get lucky and get paired up with people who are really good and then your rank gets Inflated.

377
00:22:24,483 --> 00:22:34,939
Scott: Yeah, and then you get paired in a game Where you're not so paired with people better than you we're gonna just win the game for you And then you lose a bunch because you can't carry the team and your teammates are worse than you.

378
00:22:35,381 --> 00:22:38,310
Rym: And overwatch once you get out silvers over time

379
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:41,299
Scott: right the law of averages, you know, you regress to the mean and

380
00:22:42,901 --> 00:22:50,228
Rym: Yeah, yep, but I'm gonna keep doing it because if it I'm just gonna let my competitive score float and kind of see how that Goes for us this season.

381
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:51,779
Scott: Yeah, I mean that's what you're supposed to do.

382
00:22:51,981 --> 00:22:59,434
Rym: But they also more importantly they added as a special because you know Every time they do an event like they add temporary game modes like all this fun stuff.

383
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:16,714
Rym: They added capture the flag Like old school capture the flag and the primary lesson I've learned from that is that because overwatch is the spiritual successor to like old CTF and old weapons factory and old team fortress.

384
00:23:16,834 --> 00:23:18,020
Scott: Is it literally a two-fort map?

385
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,386
Rym: No, they use the existing maps for now.

386
00:23:20,406 --> 00:23:20,587
Rym: Okay.

387
00:23:20,888 --> 00:23:26,859
Rym: Now if they make a two-fort map, like I don't know what I'll do I think I'll just quit my job and be like just play overwatch.

388
00:23:27,121 --> 00:23:33,470
Rym: If I played it every day Maybe I'll bet.

389
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:35,720
Rym: if I played every day I can at least make platinum reliably.

390
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,085
Rym: I don't know if I could go beyond that.

391
00:23:37,105 --> 00:23:40,820
Rym: cuz I am old like I'm already way past my physical prime.

392
00:23:41,663 --> 00:23:52,628
Rym: but The competitive the when you're playing this capture the flag mode the thing I've noticed that most overwatch players have clearly Never played the old capture the flag games before.

393
00:23:53,009 --> 00:23:54,333
Scott: why would they have they're so old.

394
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:57,220
Rym: the result is that when I play?

395
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:04,159
Rym: Competitive or quick play in the normal game like I'm good and other people are good and other people are better than me I'm gonna capture the flag.

396
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:07,559
Scott: You're just so great because they're not even messing with the flag and you're like worse than that.

397
00:24:07,861 --> 00:24:11,936
Rym: But many of our friends who play overwatch are way worse than me.

398
00:24:11,996 --> 00:24:12,919
Rym: at normal overwatch.

399
00:24:13,941 --> 00:24:17,075
Rym: Certain people in particular no names being named kind of bad.

400
00:24:17,376 --> 00:24:25,030
Rym: Not that I'm great I mean when I slide stream the people are better than me like Chie will just like send me messages like yeah What are you're playing diva in that map?

401
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,139
Rym: Here's the ten things you did wrong.

402
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:34,911
Rym: But our friends who are generally bad at overwatch But are our age are fucking amazing at the capture the flag.

403
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:40,471
Rym: hmm like me and Adam playing capture the flag together It's like capture kept kept kept which way I think.

404
00:24:40,632 --> 00:24:42,260
Scott: I think it's not that you're so great at it.

405
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,947
Scott: It's just that other people are.

406
00:24:44,369 --> 00:24:49,049
Scott: you know when you play capture the flag people are used to just playing FPS's and just trying to kill people.

407
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:52,246
Scott: right is the watch already isn't like that I mean, but it's like you know.

408
00:24:52,327 --> 00:24:57,878
Scott: it's like the capture the flag objective is Objectively different than every other.

409
00:24:58,707 --> 00:24:59,575
Scott: You know game mode.

410
00:24:59,615 --> 00:25:03,473
Scott: It's like well You're not you just you have six focused on movement and not on fighting.

411
00:25:03,493 --> 00:25:04,637
Scott: you have to go more than that.

412
00:25:04,737 --> 00:25:10,280
Scott: you get to a Place get a flag and get all the way back without being seen or killed or you know whatever.

413
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,363
Rym: But it's also you have to.

414
00:25:11,604 --> 00:25:17,700
Rym: you have six people on your team, and you've got to disperse them Colonel Blotto style between offense and defense.

415
00:25:18,703 --> 00:25:20,829
Rym: And if you mess that up, it's over.

416
00:25:21,271 --> 00:25:28,054
Rym: and almost every game with normal younger overwatch players They all in and draws because everyone's like super defense and doesn't quite get that.

417
00:25:28,575 --> 00:25:29,860
Scott: so over the flag.

418
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:37,951
Rym: They don't go for the flag hard enough like they can't coordinate because when you play normal overwatch You're either on offense or defense for an entire match.

419
00:25:37,991 --> 00:25:42,430
Scott: I mean even when we play Team Fortress 2 right It's just like yeah the flag.

420
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:44,360
Scott: it seems so ridiculous like get the flag.

421
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:52,400
Scott: It's a briefcase in a room in a basement in the way back And you know how the fuck can I even get in there, but you know what I captured the thing all the fucking time.

422
00:25:52,541 --> 00:25:54,730
Scott: Yeah, oh god that right tribes.

423
00:25:54,951 --> 00:26:04,160
Scott: It's on top of a tower right Ridiculously far away with a huge field of mountains in between you and it took you five minutes to fly over there.

424
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,765
Scott: It's on a helipad.

425
00:26:05,905 --> 00:26:10,980
Scott: It's in the middle of a helipad sticking out of a tower ridiculously up in the air in the wide open.

426
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:15,331
Scott: It's like how can I possibly get there without like being killed?

427
00:26:15,672 --> 00:26:18,540
Scott: grab it go off into the big open?

428
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:29,100
Scott: non-hidden area in the middle of the sky All the way back across the mountain range to my helipad to win is like how can you even do that?

429
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,700
Scott: And it's like you can do it.

430
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:39,812
Scott: It's just because the way the game is designed it seems so ridiculous like you don't even attempt it because it's so terrifying and it seems Hopeless, but when you actually try it.

431
00:26:39,913 --> 00:26:41,380
Scott: It's like oh, it's doable.

432
00:26:42,421 --> 00:26:46,316
Rym: Few things I've ever done in gaming are more stressful than having the flag.

433
00:26:46,677 --> 00:26:49,587
Rym: in a like Serious capture the flag game I mean.

434
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:53,762
Scott: granted when I get the flag more often than not I die and the flag falls on the Ground.

435
00:26:53,802 --> 00:26:55,999
Rym: yep, usually about a foot away from where you got it.

436
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:05,172
Scott: But I have captured many a flag in my day and really you know when I first started playing those games I didn't capture a lot of flags because I was afraid to go for it.

437
00:27:05,212 --> 00:27:08,572
Scott: and once I was willing to go for it I let you capture it.

438
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:16,570
Rym: Yeah But anyway things of the day what you got.

439
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:18,134
Scott: so snakes are cool.

440
00:27:18,515 --> 00:27:19,096
Scott: I like snakes.

441
00:27:19,317 --> 00:27:22,953
Scott: Thanks a pretty good good animal Right cooler than the regular snake.

442
00:27:23,355 --> 00:27:24,239
Scott: to head snake.

443
00:27:25,047 --> 00:27:26,159
Scott: How does ever to head person?

444
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,833
Scott: There are in fact the Siamese twins, but it's not like an actual to head person.

445
00:27:30,913 --> 00:27:30,993
Scott: like.

446
00:27:31,013 --> 00:27:32,237
Scott: well the same way.

447
00:27:32,258 --> 00:27:32,960
Rym: this right here.

448
00:27:34,083 --> 00:27:40,231
Rym: the recommended video on your two-headed snake is Abigail and Brittany Henzel who are famous like super share.

449
00:27:40,271 --> 00:27:43,099
Rym: twins is basically a body with two heads is it really?

450
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,017
Rym: yeah They're cool people.

451
00:27:44,903 --> 00:27:46,007
Rym: I've seen documentaries about them.

452
00:27:46,027 --> 00:27:46,529
Rym: Yeah, baby.

453
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:49,500
Scott: Yeah, it's close to two head person.

454
00:27:51,523 --> 00:27:53,752
Scott: How could it be more like they got separate brains.

455
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:55,740
Scott: they talk separately completely separate heads.

456
00:27:55,901 --> 00:27:58,520
Scott: conversation with each other separate personalities.

457
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,649
Scott: Yes, they just hang out who controls the walking.

458
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,277
Rym: uh it's complicated.

459
00:28:02,297 --> 00:28:02,980
Rym: watch the documentary.

460
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:03,980
Scott: Yeah, anyway.

461
00:28:04,281 --> 00:28:11,734
Scott: But anyway this two-headed snake is pretty cool because it's two independent heads And they sort of both control the body or whatever and you might think okay.

462
00:28:12,035 --> 00:28:13,280
Scott: I've seen a two-headed snake before.

463
00:28:13,641 --> 00:28:14,806
Scott: It's a video of a two-headed snake.

464
00:28:14,846 --> 00:28:15,549
Scott: What's a big deal.

465
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:22,679
Scott: this video is special because in this video Both heads of the snake drink water.

466
00:28:27,102 --> 00:28:33,940
Scott: Holy shit, I really wish that I had another mouth hole so I could drink water.

467
00:28:34,081 --> 00:28:36,912
Scott: That would be pretty good.

468
00:28:36,972 --> 00:28:38,760
Scott: like I'm not gonna complain about that one.

469
00:28:39,341 --> 00:28:42,330
Rym: I still think the third arm would be superior.

470
00:28:42,491 --> 00:28:47,085
Scott: the third arm is good because you can go mouse keyboard keyboard and Type and mouse at the same time.

471
00:28:47,105 --> 00:28:51,140
Scott: yeah before arms isn't really useful for anything except for like Goro cosplay.

472
00:28:51,804 --> 00:28:54,179
Scott: I don't really need the fourth arm, but the third arm would be good.

473
00:28:54,541 --> 00:28:58,532
Scott: So I'd rather have the second mouth for more water drinking than the four.

474
00:28:58,552 --> 00:29:01,897
Rym: you know what the fourth arms good for playing that hockey organ.

475
00:29:03,382 --> 00:29:05,620
Scott: Sure, you get like two organs at the same time.

476
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:12,835
Rym: So somewhat multiple people like link this to me when it was like just for whatever reason.

477
00:29:12,875 --> 00:29:14,500
Rym: everyone knows that this is my jam somehow.

478
00:29:14,621 --> 00:29:20,609
Rym: so no credit to everyone who sent this to me, but Beat of the brakeless bus.

479
00:29:20,911 --> 00:29:37,712
Rym: I saw this is this video of just two people like racing school buses drifting them around and It is set with these subtitles and the music of via the rising sun from initial D And it is way more entertaining than it has any right to be.

480
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,000
Scott: I saw a video like just the other day.

481
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:42,364
Scott: I don't know where it is I can't you send it to you?

482
00:29:42,384 --> 00:29:45,154
Scott: right now is a kid driving a car.

483
00:29:45,174 --> 00:29:56,968
Scott: his parents are in the car And he drifts around while his parents are yelling that they're like here the keys right now, and he's like That's good stuff, and he's just.

484
00:29:57,008 --> 00:29:58,253
Scott: you know he's drifting pretty great.

485
00:29:58,694 --> 00:30:00,120
Scott: You know and his parents are freaking out.

486
00:30:00,461 --> 00:30:03,611
Rym: Yeah, but it'd be like yeah, I could do it faster.

487
00:30:04,213 --> 00:30:06,119
Scott: Boonta would be like yeah, you suck.

488
00:30:08,978 --> 00:30:14,976
Rym: So The water yeah, so in the meta moment we were at PAX out, and it's totally done.

489
00:30:15,116 --> 00:30:15,638
Rym: It was awesome.

490
00:30:15,818 --> 00:30:17,538
Scott: very soon We're gonna be at PAX.

491
00:30:18,741 --> 00:30:25,550
Rym: Yup, we're doing a rewritten version of an old panel idea We did many years ago called we used to do.

492
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:33,298
Rym: this panel called how to win at games, so I'm doing like legit research, and I'm learning a lot about trying to upgrade the panel.

493
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,810
Rym: well I'm trying to go deeper with it like I'm trying to go like.

494
00:30:35,871 --> 00:30:37,258
Rym: so we talked about like the gays.

495
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:37,720
Scott: you're right.

496
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,603
Scott: You ran an idea.

497
00:30:38,644 --> 00:30:40,069
Scott: is he was gonna upgrade the old idea.

498
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:56,640
Rym: well the old idea was so old that I looked at the structure of it and Remember that panel was written back, and we still use that blue background, so I'm modernizing this panel And it's gonna be a lot more like the quitting panel or the grinding panel, and I've also learned some stuff.

499
00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:01,395
Rym: I found some papers that were not as publicly available back when I wrote that thing.

500
00:31:01,435 --> 00:31:05,626
Rym: in fact many of these things were published After I wrote that panel the first time.

501
00:31:06,388 --> 00:31:13,170
Rym: so we're gonna do play dirty to win on I believe Friday at 6 p.m It's not enough playing dirty to win.

502
00:31:13,512 --> 00:31:17,188
Rym: Yeah the moral is Play to win, and if you follow the rules.

503
00:31:17,649 --> 00:31:23,852
Rym: That's totally okay, and if the rules suck the game sucks You should still play to win mm-hmm and the other part.

504
00:31:23,892 --> 00:31:29,718
Rym: the other moral of that panel is most your friends Probably won't want to play games with you anymore if you actually do what we say.

505
00:31:30,882 --> 00:31:32,556
Rym: Play games with you sure?

506
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:36,066
Rym: yeah The book club book I still got to decide.

507
00:31:36,107 --> 00:31:39,839
Rym: I'm leaning toward dune Because I never actually read the whole thing.

508
00:31:40,802 --> 00:31:41,464
Rym: You know what fuck it.

509
00:31:41,504 --> 00:31:41,945
Rym: It's dune.

510
00:31:42,607 --> 00:31:48,321
Scott: the next book is dune pro-tip the paper dead tree version of dune is cheaper than the Kindle Version.

511
00:31:48,482 --> 00:31:52,155
Rym: pro tip I have like four copies of the paper edition of dune.

512
00:31:52,175 --> 00:31:53,620
Scott: I'll get around anyone.

513
00:31:54,642 --> 00:31:56,294
Scott: Another pro tip the library is free.

514
00:31:56,314 --> 00:32:00,192
Scott: another pro tip This is a way easy book just get like a used copy for like a dollar.

515
00:32:00,413 --> 00:32:06,219
Rym: another pro tip if you get a library card You can just download ebooks onto your Kindle, and I'm pretty sure you can do that with dune.

516
00:32:06,962 --> 00:32:10,460
Scott: Yeah, this is like when you go for the super popular book like this.

517
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,328
Scott: It's way easy to get like it meant.

518
00:32:12,509 --> 00:32:14,517
Scott: like why isn't it just fucking public domain already.

519
00:32:14,537 --> 00:32:15,220
Scott: It's like Jesus Christ.

520
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:28,509
Rym: I am very curious to see How my adult sensibilities react to dune which I read some of and stopped reading as a child and I know primarily Through the rules to the dune board game.

521
00:32:28,649 --> 00:32:30,214
Scott: I know it primarily through the board game.

522
00:32:30,234 --> 00:32:42,518
Scott: Yeah pop culture and interactions I've had over the course of my life because everyone else around me like knows everything about well 30-something year old Scott hate it like middle school Scott and now couldn't even get past like a few chapters and remembers nothing.

523
00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:48,100
Rym: and also Will 35 year old Rym who has now read books like the prince of nothing?

524
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,629
Rym: Decide that this isn't dense enough.

525
00:32:51,333 --> 00:32:52,198
Scott: I can guarantee.

526
00:32:52,258 --> 00:32:58,886
Scott: however We will make as many spice jokes as we please which is probably many Will flow.

527
00:32:58,906 --> 00:33:00,473
Scott: the spice jokes will flow.

528
00:33:00,554 --> 00:33:01,639
Scott: that is that is what will happen.

529
00:33:02,501 --> 00:33:08,643
Rym: Also, we will probably you'll the impression I get is we're gonna run into a lot of quotes or a lot of aphorisms that we didn't Realize.

530
00:33:08,663 --> 00:33:09,208
Rym: we're from dune.

531
00:33:09,228 --> 00:33:16,200
Scott: Oh That could be like when I like when we talked about because it's such a because it's such a big sci-fi thing.

532
00:33:16,301 --> 00:33:18,840
Scott: It's probably been referenced a whole bunch and I've missed all those references.

533
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,831
Rym: I'll be like here's the mind killer like that.

534
00:33:20,871 --> 00:33:22,300
Rym: That's all dune like that kind of stuff.

535
00:33:22,541 --> 00:33:26,293
Scott: I mean, I've never heard anyone say that you've never you ever heard someone give the fear litany.

536
00:33:26,775 --> 00:33:36,400
Rym: I mean, it's it's I was playing overwatch Like not that long ago and someone just started typing that into the chat on the team before the competitive match.

537
00:33:36,822 --> 00:33:38,814
Rym: Like that is a widespread litany.

538
00:33:38,834 --> 00:33:49,290
Rym: Mmm Yeah, type fear litany litany against fear dune fandom like first link.

539
00:33:50,073 --> 00:33:50,575
Scott: Never heard of it.

540
00:33:50,676 --> 00:33:51,338
Rym: You've never heard of.

541
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,463
Rym: I must not fear.

542
00:33:52,805 --> 00:33:54,010
Rym: fear is the mind killer.

543
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:57,324
Rym: No, there is the little death that brings total obliteration.

544
00:33:57,384 --> 00:33:58,770
Rym: Oh, I will face my fear.

545
00:33:59,111 --> 00:34:07,280
Rym: I will permit it to pass over me and through me and when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see Its path where the fear has gone.

546
00:34:07,341 --> 00:34:10,514
Rym: There will be nothing only I Will remain.

547
00:34:10,554 --> 00:34:11,458
Scott: I never heard that my life.

548
00:34:12,081 --> 00:34:16,074
Rym: I think Paula Trades says it okay It's a spell.

549
00:34:16,216 --> 00:34:17,723
Rym: the Bene Gesserit up already.

550
00:34:17,763 --> 00:34:18,266
Rym: I'm going deep.

551
00:34:18,588 --> 00:34:19,010
Rym: read the book.

552
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,498
Scott: Is that what you tell yourself to?

553
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:22,489
Scott: you know, take the spice without being afraid?

554
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,233
Rym: Ah, the litany gets fair.

555
00:34:24,273 --> 00:34:29,550
Rym: was a litany spoken by many highly educated people who face danger or fear during their everyday lives?

556
00:34:29,971 --> 00:34:30,232
Scott: Mm-hmm.

557
00:34:30,634 --> 00:34:30,935
Scott: All right.

558
00:34:31,356 --> 00:34:35,070
Scott: All right, try to use it for real then next time you're going to some danger.

559
00:34:35,433 --> 00:34:37,030
Scott: Well, is that what you say when you go skiing?

560
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,554
Rym: When I'm skiing, I'm just thinking yum.

561
00:34:39,636 --> 00:34:39,916
Rym: Yum.

562
00:34:40,077 --> 00:34:40,739
Rym: Yum.

563
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:41,120
Rym: Yum.

564
00:34:41,301 --> 00:34:44,969
Scott: And then the the volatile snowman comes from behind The tree comes from the front.

565
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:55,755
Rym: Otherwise both Scott and I are live streaming more and more and I'm increasingly building more and more Sophisticated live streams.

566
00:34:56,096 --> 00:35:02,178
Rym: if you've been watching my overwatch live streams, you'll see that it's not just overwatch But it's also a face cam and a hand.

567
00:35:02,238 --> 00:35:02,600
Rym: can

568
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:08,083
Scott: I think I'm gonna go to the new system that I see a lot of other People doing which is where you live stream,

569
00:35:08,304 --> 00:35:09,450
Rym: but you don't make that video

570
00:35:09,971 --> 00:35:20,886
Scott: That public and what you do is you record your whole live stream locally and then you edit like you find the bet the highlight And you upload the highlight to YouTube after as its own like just a YouTube video.

571
00:35:20,926 --> 00:35:21,810
Rym: That's what I've been doing.

572
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:25,005
Scott: I guess I've been well, I've been actually watching a lot of hearthstone on Twitch.

573
00:35:25,447 --> 00:35:26,130
Scott: Is it that season?

574
00:35:26,571 --> 00:35:31,509
Scott: Yeah, and that's what these people do is they play More hearthstone in like a day than I play in a month.

575
00:35:31,911 --> 00:35:38,961
Scott: But and they stream it all and then they take like the best hearthstone game They played and they put that on YouTube on its own in HD.

576
00:35:39,181 --> 00:35:39,402
Rym: Yep.

577
00:35:39,543 --> 00:36:00,690
Rym: So my pro tip for you because I've been doing that is When you record like, you know do the stream and just check that box to make sure it automatically goes unlisted like once it's done Mm-hmm, and then like that day go watch the video at like 4x speed and pull out all the interesting bits That might exist then because if you wait you will never look at that video again.

578
00:36:00,951 --> 00:36:01,554
Scott: Yeah, that's pretty much.

579
00:36:01,575 --> 00:36:04,190
Rym: you will never find the funny thing that you remember happening.

580
00:36:05,151 --> 00:36:06,597
Rym: And yeah, that is my advice.

581
00:36:06,637 --> 00:36:08,485
Scott: You can also like write down time codes or whatever.

582
00:36:08,606 --> 00:36:08,887
Scott: Yes.

583
00:36:08,987 --> 00:36:09,610
Rym: Is that gonna happen?

584
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:12,848
Scott: hmm, the other thing you can do is I can look at the.

585
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:20,979
Scott: If I look at the whole track like zoomed out like at the bottom part in the timeline I can see the parts where I'm talking right?

586
00:36:20,999 --> 00:36:27,990
Scott: Yeah, it's like if I'm talking that's probably the interesting part You know and the part where I'm just being quiet and playing is not the interesting part.

587
00:36:28,592 --> 00:36:32,430
Scott: So I can just find the parts where I say stuff and edit out all the long boring parts, right?

588
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:32,997
Scott: I don't do anything.

589
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:33,403
Rym: Yep.

590
00:36:33,443 --> 00:36:33,626
Rym: Yep.

591
00:36:33,666 --> 00:36:46,230
Rym: Yep Though there is all like the live stream like people seem to like a lot of people in bugging me to just live stream siv6 Even though like I'm not gonna say anything if I'm playing siv6 It's just gonna be just me slowly playing siv6 for like four hours.

592
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:56,452
Scott: Well, the thing I've realized is that it's really hard to become like the streaming person because The people who are like the big streams It's like.

593
00:36:56,512 --> 00:36:59,243
Scott: it's so easy for them because they have a ton of viewers already so they can.

594
00:36:59,364 --> 00:37:02,930
Scott: they can always go to the viewers See what they're saying and basically talk to them, right?

595
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:10,799
Rym: I'll have like six to twelve people watching the stream and so the only messages there are hey Rym And wow, you suck at overwatch, right?

596
00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:13,150
Scott: It's like, you know the people with the big twitch chats.

597
00:37:13,484 --> 00:37:19,208
Scott: Yeah It's a big flood of crap but they can still look at it and they'll be so like a non crap that they can respond to.

598
00:37:19,228 --> 00:37:27,846
Scott: and Also, they got people donating and subscribing and whenever anyone subscribes like they all have a shtick Like this is one guy every time someone subscribes to his channel.

599
00:37:27,866 --> 00:37:28,610
Scott: He gets his dick out.

600
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:30,918
Scott: No, he's like welcome to the dragon army, right?

601
00:37:30,938 --> 00:37:33,687
Scott: Yeah, he's like, thanks, you know, he's got something to end.

602
00:37:33,728 --> 00:37:34,350
Scott: people donate.

603
00:37:34,731 --> 00:37:38,086
Scott: They did not subscribing just like directly donating like here's a dollar.

604
00:37:38,106 --> 00:37:38,990
Rym: YouTube has that.

605
00:37:39,334 --> 00:37:42,578
Scott: They put a message with it They put a message and then the person reads.

606
00:37:42,638 --> 00:37:46,332
Scott: the message is like a guaranteed way to get the streaming person to read what you Got to say.

607
00:37:46,352 --> 00:37:47,276
Scott: and it's like.

608
00:37:47,336 --> 00:37:50,549
Scott: you can only do all that stuff and make your stream have that.

609
00:37:50,569 --> 00:37:56,470
Scott: if You got a bunch of viewers if you got like three You know, you can't really do that so much.

610
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:59,290
Scott: It's like all on you to keep talking while you're playing a game.

611
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:03,510
Rym: So the other way to do it is like an overwatch group up with people.

612
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:07,383
Rym: So you have funny people with you and just do what you.

613
00:38:07,423 --> 00:38:15,170
Rym: normally I'm playing a single-player game usually Yeah, or if you're doing that do a pseudo podcast like just start a discord chat.

614
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:18,330
Scott: Well, for example, like what I did I did played for Xanadu, right?

615
00:38:18,971 --> 00:38:23,410
Scott: And I talked a whole bunch at the beginning and then once I started, you know got deeper in the game.

616
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:27,418
Scott: It's just like I only really had to talk when something happened in the game And other than that, it was just.

617
00:38:27,439 --> 00:38:29,150
Rym: the worst thing is like Civ 5.

618
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:33,169
Scott: I already said all the things I had to say about Xanadu that would have said if we did a podcast on.

619
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:38,573
Rym: well You guys see how the Civ 5 videos I put up of like the long games were playing and I had a lot to say Like every turn.

620
00:38:39,054 --> 00:38:39,555
Rym: but that's cuz.

621
00:38:39,596 --> 00:38:41,702
Rym: I know Civ 5 like inside and out.

622
00:38:42,063 --> 00:38:44,590
Rym: I don't know Civ 6 enough to say shit.

623
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:46,316
Scott: I'm mostly looking at the screen just thinking.

624
00:38:46,336 --> 00:38:47,580
Scott: I haven't played Civ 6 in months.

625
00:38:48,042 --> 00:38:49,125
Rym: Oh, there's already an expansion.

626
00:38:49,145 --> 00:38:49,687
Rym: They added Poland.

627
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:52,113
Scott: Poland's pretty good.

628
00:38:52,153 --> 00:38:52,937
Scott: Didn't they have Poland before?

629
00:38:53,058 --> 00:38:53,239
Scott: No.

630
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,425
Scott: Okay Poland's pretty good.

631
00:38:54,546 --> 00:38:55,350
Scott: Does it got to pay for that?

632
00:38:56,791 --> 00:38:57,875
Rym: Maybe I think I paid for it.

633
00:38:57,895 --> 00:38:59,059
Rym: I don't know.

634
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,986
Rym: I play Civ 6.

635
00:39:00,986 --> 00:39:04,457
Rym: I think I'm gonna start a GMR game of it once.

636
00:39:04,477 --> 00:39:05,040
Scott: Do they have that?

637
00:39:05,442 --> 00:39:06,467
Rym: They tested it in alpha.

638
00:39:06,487 --> 00:39:07,070
Rym: It seems to work.

639
00:39:07,231 --> 00:39:09,243
Rym: I'm waiting for it to be like in the normal client.

640
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:10,028
Scott: I'll definitely do that.

641
00:39:10,189 --> 00:39:13,177
Rym: Yeah Only people who will take their fucking turn though.

642
00:39:13,197 --> 00:39:14,221
Scott: Yeah, I'll take my turn.

643
00:39:14,241 --> 00:39:18,459
Scott: Looking at you Andrew in the other game Just can't you make him forfeit?

644
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:27,382
Rym: You cannot kick people out Mm-hmm, you can set a threshold where if a certain number of turns get skipped where the AI took the turn Then it'll kick that player out.

645
00:39:27,825 --> 00:39:32,905
Rym: So one I said it low enough to where certain people might get kicked out of certain games in the near future.

646
00:39:32,926 --> 00:39:38,348
Rym: Mm-hmm Okay, so Scott sent me a message while I was in ski trip and he was like, yeah We're gonna play this game and do show on it.

647
00:39:38,671 --> 00:39:39,519
Scott: And then we did so.

648
00:39:39,539 --> 00:39:47,880
Scott: I was you know I had this idea for a board game that I've been half working on and like I made more progress on it than any other Solid like.

649
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:48,770
Rym: the concept is great.

650
00:39:48,972 --> 00:39:52,518
Scott: So my basic idea was you know I wanted to make a game based on gobs.

651
00:39:52,538 --> 00:40:00,290
Scott: because the only game based on gobs which if you don't know is the game of pure Strategy because so many people are so mad about randomness and all sorts of other things.

652
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:03,610
Scott: I'm like, well the game we're looking for is gobs, but gobs is boring as hell.

653
00:40:03,991 --> 00:40:12,390
Scott: Let's make interesting gobs by combining it with other stuff and the only game that does that is el grande Which combines it with current play again?

654
00:40:12,571 --> 00:40:16,470
Scott: El grande is is gobs plus colonel blotto, right?

655
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:22,950
Scott: So I'm like, well, let's just take gobs and combine it with something else and like advance wars or some shit Who knows and make a better game, right?

656
00:40:23,591 --> 00:40:25,884
Scott: so I was working on something along those lines.

657
00:40:26,025 --> 00:40:26,246
Scott: ish.

658
00:40:26,809 --> 00:40:32,710
Scott: and Then I'm on YouTube and I see this video about this board game called raptor as in the dinosaur not the call of the shadows.

659
00:40:34,232 --> 00:40:41,144
Scott: And I watched this like really short video that explained all the rules and I'm like, holy shit That's like 90% the game that I was making.

660
00:40:41,506 --> 00:40:42,029
Scott: what the fuck?

661
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:54,193
Scott: Okay, and then on my way home like this weekend I go to the game store and it's just sitting there right on the shelf and I'm like, oh, I guess I'm fucking buy that Cute.

662
00:40:54,213 --> 00:40:57,510
Scott: it's two-player game and I brought a home and I just brought it.

663
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:59,319
Scott: We just played it two times just now one time.

664
00:40:59,339 --> 00:41:01,128
Scott: I was the Raptor and one time room was the Raptor.

665
00:41:01,148 --> 00:41:02,074
Rym: Yep I like it.

666
00:41:02,618 --> 00:41:04,430
Scott: Yeah, this is like, you know to play a game.

667
00:41:04,771 --> 00:41:09,285
Rym: It's not as good like if you're looking for a deep two-player game, it's not lost cities.

668
00:41:09,386 --> 00:41:12,469
Rym: It's not battle line It's not seven wonders duel.

669
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:15,560
Rym: I don't think it's better than battle line.

670
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,809
Rym: I don't know battle line is so tight.

671
00:41:18,291 --> 00:41:19,435
Scott: It's not as good as lost cities.

672
00:41:19,456 --> 00:41:19,998
Scott: That's for sure.

673
00:41:20,058 --> 00:41:22,910
Rym: Yeah, I think battle line is deeper than lost cities.

674
00:41:23,091 --> 00:41:25,729
Scott: So what this game basically is is it's gobs?

675
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:32,230
Rym: Plus so gobs goof field game of pure strategy plus mouse guards swords and stronghold.

676
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:46,097
Rym: Yep, swords and strongholds has the idea that it's one of those like symmetric like perfect information games Except you're limited in actions because you have a small hand of cards from a small deck and you can only take actions that You have cards for.

677
00:41:46,117 --> 00:41:49,290
Rym: so it's like which is great because it limits the scope of interaction.

678
00:41:49,372 --> 00:41:50,751
Rym: This game is the same thing It's gobs.

679
00:41:51,032 --> 00:41:57,370
Rym: gobs is basically everyone has deck of cards and you all just play a card and then the highest card wins.

680
00:41:57,711 --> 00:41:59,837
Rym: Yep, but you all have the same deck.

681
00:41:59,877 --> 00:42:00,840
Rym: So what's your strategy?

682
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:04,089
Rym: You play the king first play the two first.

683
00:42:04,773 --> 00:42:05,618
Rym: You doing there?

684
00:42:05,638 --> 00:42:06,161
Rym: Yep.

685
00:42:06,302 --> 00:42:08,153
Rym: There's a lot of strategy in that Mm-hmm.

686
00:42:09,058 --> 00:42:10,870
Rym: But anyway, this game is nothing but strategy.

687
00:42:10,911 --> 00:42:11,728
Scott: It's pure strategy.

688
00:42:12,151 --> 00:42:13,155
Rym: But a big problem.

689
00:42:13,175 --> 00:42:20,927
Rym: if you try to take a game and use the gobs mechanic as your core mechanic Is that there is definitely an analysis paralysis situation?

690
00:42:21,208 --> 00:42:23,917
Scott: Well, the Difficult problem is okay.

691
00:42:23,977 --> 00:42:27,730
Scott: So you're playing gobs right and then gobs is somehow influencing this other game.

692
00:42:28,572 --> 00:42:29,877
Scott: You have to design it such that.

693
00:42:29,937 --> 00:42:31,723
Scott: well does the other game even matter?

694
00:42:31,823 --> 00:42:34,635
Scott: or is just whoever wins the gobs ends up winning the Game.

695
00:42:34,695 --> 00:42:36,610
Scott: so why even bother playing the other stuff?

696
00:42:37,051 --> 00:42:44,190
Rym: Just like otherwise the other game might as well just be Street fighter and it shows the health and the fighting based on what you played in the real game.

697
00:42:44,531 --> 00:42:46,416
Scott: Or do you make it such that?

698
00:42:46,677 --> 00:42:50,368
Scott: Oh, well, actually the gobs doesn't matter as much.

699
00:42:50,749 --> 00:42:52,797
Scott: in which case Why even have the gobs there?

700
00:42:52,817 --> 00:42:54,645
Scott: You're now no longer.

701
00:42:54,745 --> 00:42:55,930
Scott: Is it a game of pure strategy?

702
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:59,950
Scott: You've got more you've added in luck or whatever the flaws are of the other game.

703
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:06,675
Scott: So, you know Grande the gobs part is just bidding for first to go first, right and Deciding how meant that?

704
00:43:06,695 --> 00:43:12,820
Rym: the balance there is that the lower cards lets you bring capieros from the what's-its And also sometimes you want to go last?

705
00:43:13,061 --> 00:43:14,470
Scott: Yeah, you don't want to go first sometimes.

706
00:43:14,551 --> 00:43:20,504
Scott: So it's like that's only controlling part of the game But because that's an important part of the game, but not the whole game.

707
00:43:20,886 --> 00:43:21,509
Scott: It works out.

708
00:43:21,984 --> 00:43:26,668
Rym: Yep it can serve like a balance because typically the way these games work even though there aren't that many of them like.

709
00:43:26,708 --> 00:43:29,024
Rym: that's why this game is notable enough for us to have played it.

710
00:43:29,569 --> 00:43:30,853
Rym: and You're talking about it.

711
00:43:30,893 --> 00:43:38,032
Rym: Now is that you'll have like low numbers to high numbers, but the lower numbers have better powers Mm-hmm.

712
00:43:38,393 --> 00:43:42,590
Rym: So like a low number does a power but a high number wins the thing whatever the thing is.

713
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:52,730
Scott: so in raptor They use a mechanic that I obviously I didn't steal from them But me and also the designers of this game Which is Citadel's guy Bruno if I duty and another guy named Bruno Bruno?

714
00:43:53,592 --> 00:43:54,955
Scott: Actually has made what.

715
00:43:55,496 --> 00:44:02,413
Rym: so Bruno kathala worked with Antoine Bauza on seven waters duel, okay, which is Fantastic.

716
00:44:02,694 --> 00:44:02,955
Scott: All right.

717
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:05,787
Rym: So you got also five tribes and shadows over Camelot.

718
00:44:05,847 --> 00:44:09,050
Rym: Well, that's not good But yeah, but that looks like it's well, it's a bridge.

719
00:44:09,191 --> 00:44:12,870
Scott: So you got this other guy named Bruno kathala plus the citadels guy.

720
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:14,842
Scott: They came together and made this game.

721
00:44:14,863 --> 00:44:15,748
Scott: and here's how the game goes.

722
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:20,090
Scott: I mean you get scientists and you got el raptors the raptor and a bunch of babies, right?

723
00:44:20,632 --> 00:44:23,282
Scott: And really this the five raptor babies are the points.

724
00:44:23,784 --> 00:44:26,140
Scott: so either side can win though the.

725
00:44:26,566 --> 00:44:30,823
Scott: if the Raptor makes three babies escape the map then the raptor wins.

726
00:44:31,084 --> 00:44:35,486
Scott: if the scientists capture three babies they win and there are five babies.

727
00:44:35,849 --> 00:44:39,720
Scott: if The raptor yeah, you want to get three out of the five babies.

728
00:44:40,181 --> 00:44:48,014
Scott: if the mommy raptor kills all the scientists on the board So there's no scientist on the board at a given point in time The mommy wins.

729
00:44:48,716 --> 00:44:53,589
Scott: if the mommy raptor takes five damage and falls asleep the scientists win.

730
00:44:54,653 --> 00:44:55,878
Scott: See is what you do on your turn.

731
00:44:56,219 --> 00:44:58,689
Scott: You got a deck of nine cards one through nine.

732
00:44:59,473 --> 00:45:00,378
Scott: So it is the other person.

733
00:45:00,398 --> 00:45:01,081
Scott: you play gobs.

734
00:45:01,121 --> 00:45:02,769
Scott: you both play a card and reveal it.

735
00:45:03,351 --> 00:45:05,649
Scott: Whoever plays the higher number wins.

736
00:45:06,252 --> 00:45:07,315
Scott: The other person loses.

737
00:45:07,375 --> 00:45:11,690
Scott: the loser goes first and uses the ability on their card.

738
00:45:11,952 --> 00:45:15,375
Scott: Well, that doesn't sound like losing to me But the winner loses.

739
00:45:15,415 --> 00:45:19,106
Rym: just a convenient way to express it because there aren't that many games like exactly.

740
00:45:19,147 --> 00:45:20,210
Scott: the winner goes second.

741
00:45:20,411 --> 00:45:23,210
Scott: But what they do is they take the number on the card they played.

742
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:25,179
Scott: So let's say I play the eight and Rym played the two.

743
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,669
Scott: he does the ability on his card number two.

744
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:30,398
Scott: Then I take eight minus two is six.

745
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:33,870
Scott: I take six regular actions, which are way strong.

746
00:45:34,151 --> 00:45:34,532
Rym: So you can.

747
00:45:34,552 --> 00:45:36,339
Scott: then we play then we play again.

748
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:45,070
Scott: and the thing is it's not quite gobs Because you only have three cards in your hand at a time, you know, it's like limited got limited in real gobs.

749
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:46,696
Scott: You don't have a deck You've got a whole hat.

750
00:45:46,716 --> 00:45:48,349
Scott: you just hold every card in your hand all the time.

751
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:56,805
Rym: But what this does is if I held the entire deck in my hand The game would take like I could spend a lot of time computing strategies.

752
00:45:57,085 --> 00:45:58,550
Rym: the game can get locked in really quick.

753
00:45:58,832 --> 00:46:00,990
Rym: It removes a lot of the guys they take away.

754
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:02,374
Scott: They do what I said before.

755
00:46:02,434 --> 00:46:08,883
Rym: they remove some of the pure strategy of gobs to make it to add a tactical element of alright I got a one a two and nine.

756
00:46:10,194 --> 00:46:10,978
Rym: Let's play ball.

757
00:46:11,159 --> 00:46:11,420
Scott: Yep.

758
00:46:12,224 --> 00:46:13,109
Rym: What can I do with this?

759
00:46:14,191 --> 00:46:23,070
Scott: So, you know the actions are like move Raptor around move scientists shoot the Raptor a fire on the board Fire drive around in a jeep, right?

760
00:46:23,291 --> 00:46:23,473
Scott: It's just.

761
00:46:23,494 --> 00:46:24,426
Scott: it's just a nice little.

762
00:46:24,486 --> 00:46:24,689
Scott: you know.

763
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:25,552
Scott: Like what's it?

764
00:46:25,613 --> 00:46:31,170
Scott: three six not a nine by six grid with some obstacles and exits on both ends.

765
00:46:32,071 --> 00:46:32,714
Scott: You know, it's just.

766
00:46:32,814 --> 00:46:36,086
Scott: it's similar actually to you know, Mouse Guard swords and strongholds, right?

767
00:46:36,106 --> 00:46:40,405
Scott: Yeah a few pieces You're moving around you get more scientists onto the board.

768
00:46:40,605 --> 00:46:41,429
Rym: I'm liking this.

769
00:46:42,652 --> 00:46:45,730
Rym: Have a small repeat like cycling deck of actions.

770
00:46:46,131 --> 00:46:50,048
Rym: But a small number of those actually miles got is the three kinds of actions and it just sets.

771
00:46:50,068 --> 00:46:54,789
Rym: of those in the deck This one is you have nine unique cards and you just keep cycling through that deck.

772
00:46:55,392 --> 00:47:00,870
Rym: So everything's gonna come up eventually and the only real randomness is what options you have right now.

773
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:04,450
Rym: But by giving you three cards to pick from it's not completely random.

774
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:11,734
Rym: You just have to sort of decide what to do and like look at what the other person's played and just sort of make a Tactical decision.

775
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:14,810
Scott: Yeah, so the game, you know ends up turning out.

776
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:16,622
Scott: They have like lots of interesting decisions.

777
00:47:16,683 --> 00:47:20,149
Scott: right the start of your turn You have a really tough decision of what card to play.

778
00:47:21,151 --> 00:47:23,843
Scott: Then after you've played the card and you figure out what you're gonna get.

779
00:47:24,224 --> 00:47:28,150
Scott: It's like you got another hard decision Which is like well, what the hell do I do with my five action points?

780
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:31,630
Scott: Yeah, and then even at the start of the game, it's like where the hell do I place my guys?

781
00:47:31,791 --> 00:47:35,630
Scott: It's like there's all sorts of interesting decisions on like every single freaking turn of this game.

782
00:47:36,652 --> 00:47:37,495
Scott: So it's way fun.

783
00:47:37,636 --> 00:47:45,750
Scott: Even if it's not necessarily like the deepest or the hardest core It's like for two players an asymmetric game that's got replay value and is interesting.

784
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:48,392
Scott: It's like that doesn't come around too often I would guess.

785
00:47:48,673 --> 00:47:55,601
Scott: even if you own lost cities and mouse guard and all these other two-player games that are great battle line It'll be easy to get someone to play.

786
00:47:55,641 --> 00:47:56,508
Scott: there's no you know.

787
00:47:56,871 --> 00:47:58,237
Scott: Oh like you're not.

788
00:47:58,337 --> 00:48:01,270
Scott: you're gonna get bored of all those and you're gonna want another two-player game.

789
00:48:01,310 --> 00:48:02,476
Scott: And this is the one now.

790
00:48:02,617 --> 00:48:22,250
Rym: I do feel like there are probably degenerate strategies I. So yeah There's definitely see now that is heavily mitigated by the fact that you just might not draw the cards you need Mm-hmm, but at the same time there are definitely gonna be some pretty locked in strategies If you play this more than like five times, right?

791
00:48:22,350 --> 00:48:28,670
Scott: It definitely seems that the Raptors right are sort of like the agro team, right?

792
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:38,314
Scott: So the Raptor wants to go early and because you only start like four scientists on the board and you can almost always just like Kill one right away due to the initial placement rules Yeah, and it's bad structure.

793
00:48:38,334 --> 00:48:46,750
Scott: more scientists out because the depending yeah, you have to lose with those cards, which is right Anyway, but so the Raptor has to go agro.

794
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:54,750
Scott: They gotta kill scientists quickly move quickly and like get all the babies to one corner and start shoving them off the board.

795
00:48:54,910 --> 00:48:55,693
Scott: You know fast.

796
00:48:56,154 --> 00:49:01,030
Scott: if they can't move fast the scientists winning becomes more of an inevitability, right?

797
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:09,585
Scott: It's like if the scientists don't lose in the early game they just need to hold on and it's very hard for the Raptor to win as the game goes on.

798
00:49:09,625 --> 00:49:17,950
Scott: because the one big rule is that For the bait this see Raptor to wake up a baby the Raptor has to go near the baby.

799
00:49:18,472 --> 00:49:25,008
Scott: So the scientists can put Raptors to sleep everywhere and even if they can't capture them They can't leave easily, right?

800
00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:33,169
Scott: So they need to get them off the board quick and like all together quickly like hurry up my babies come You know, let's all get together and run away.

801
00:49:33,751 --> 00:49:36,178
Scott: Yeah, if you don't do that, it's bad news.

802
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:40,410
Rym: It seems like a very powerful like first run strategy.

803
00:49:40,432 --> 00:49:42,367
Rym: You know We always talk about like in those winning panels.

804
00:49:42,428 --> 00:49:42,630
Rym: how?

805
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:49,230
Rym: When you play a game the first time there's usually one like really great strategy that works until other people kind of figure out the game.

806
00:49:49,754 --> 00:49:59,696
Rym: Like the obvious thing to do as opposed to the obvious thing in this game is to shoot the Raptor first ignore the babies because as you keep getting sleep darts into the Raptor the Raptor slower and slower.

807
00:49:59,796 --> 00:50:01,242
Scott: Raptor really is a hard time moving.

808
00:50:01,302 --> 00:50:06,282
Scott: if you shoot like just shoot it as soon as you can And it will basically be almost impossible for it to move.

809
00:50:06,844 --> 00:50:07,869
Scott: and then what does it do?

810
00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:11,586
Scott: Yeah, it has to get a healing somehow which does it does a big healing card.

811
00:50:11,626 --> 00:50:12,430
Scott: Just how you gonna play it.

812
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:13,072
Scott: It's not hard.

813
00:50:13,213 --> 00:50:13,735
Scott: It's not easy.

814
00:50:13,915 --> 00:50:14,116
Scott: Yep.

815
00:50:14,598 --> 00:50:16,024
Rym: So but the game is super fun.

816
00:50:16,064 --> 00:50:19,739
Rym: like for the likeness of this game I'm really impressed with how fun it is.

817
00:50:19,919 --> 00:50:22,390
Scott: Yeah, I mean they made a lot more progress on this idea than I did.

818
00:50:22,771 --> 00:50:26,103
Rym: Yeah, well cuz they really constrained what they were doing.

819
00:50:26,203 --> 00:50:26,504
Rym: Yes.

820
00:50:26,544 --> 00:50:28,110
Rym: They made a very limited number of power.

821
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:31,250
Scott: I was making a much bigger game that but it was so similar.

822
00:50:31,290 --> 00:50:36,369
Rym: I was like, wow, in fact, my only complaints about this game at all are that the rules are not very well-written.

823
00:50:36,429 --> 00:50:43,474
Rym: really Okay, so actually I think the rules are way but no so qualify that by like our ridiculous standards They're way better.

824
00:50:43,535 --> 00:50:45,950
Rym: I mean listen then like potion explosion.

825
00:50:46,151 --> 00:50:51,610
Scott: There are a couple flaws in the rules, but overall this is like 90% well-written rules, right?

826
00:50:51,871 --> 00:50:52,578
Scott: They so the.

827
00:50:53,325 --> 00:50:53,870
Scott: here's the problems.

828
00:50:53,952 --> 00:51:06,048
Scott: I have one they are actually really good about using the word tile and the word space when Appropriate because a tile is a whole tile that has nine spaces on it and tile and space adjacency are both things, right?

829
00:51:06,489 --> 00:51:09,942
Scott: But Just be you know, they're they never mess up.

830
00:51:10,022 --> 00:51:11,047
Rym: What is the turn right?

831
00:51:11,248 --> 00:51:17,963
Scott: Well, okay They never mess up writing the rules when it comes to tile and space But it's just confusing cuz like you're in your brain.

832
00:51:18,425 --> 00:51:19,650
Scott: It's like tile space.

833
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:24,470
Scott: You have to actually like consciously pay attention to that to not mess it up or you might get really confused.

834
00:51:24,551 --> 00:51:26,182
Scott: Like wait adjacent tile.

835
00:51:26,242 --> 00:51:27,330
Scott: He has to be right next to me.

836
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:30,418
Scott: It's like no they actually mean the adjacent tile.

837
00:51:30,459 --> 00:51:35,854
Rym: when Scott was the Raptor and when I was there after we both made that Mistake to our detriment.

838
00:51:36,075 --> 00:51:40,550
Rym: Yes, we took an action and then realized oh, that's not gonna work out the way I expected right?

839
00:51:41,312 --> 00:51:43,459
Scott: The one rule they actually mess up.

840
00:51:44,081 --> 00:51:45,425
Scott: Well, they didn't mess this up.

841
00:51:45,505 --> 00:51:48,918
Scott: Well, they use the word turn Vague you're getting ahead.

842
00:51:48,958 --> 00:51:49,501
Scott: There's other rules.

843
00:51:49,542 --> 00:51:50,589
Scott: You gotta talk about first, right?

844
00:51:50,609 --> 00:52:06,527
Scott: So No, so is When you play the same exact number as your opponent you discard the card and it isn't 100% clear that whether you should draw a third card and then play another one or if you shouldn't.

845
00:52:07,009 --> 00:52:07,270
Scott: so.

846
00:52:08,132 --> 00:52:13,086
Scott: But obviously you should because otherwise you could theoretically get three ties and be left with an empty hand.

847
00:52:13,106 --> 00:52:14,370
Scott: see soft lock, right?

848
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:22,930
Scott: So obviously you always have three cards in your hand And if you tie you draw another one before you play another one, but it doesn't explicitly say that right, you know.

849
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:24,896
Scott: So that's just a poor writing.

850
00:52:24,936 --> 00:52:28,768
Scott: But obviously that's the ruling it could look like I said comes down into.

851
00:52:28,788 --> 00:52:31,216
Rym: it Doesn't define what a turn is right.

852
00:52:31,296 --> 00:52:32,620
Rym: also uses the word round.

853
00:52:32,981 --> 00:52:33,242
Scott: Yes.

854
00:52:33,322 --> 00:52:35,750
Scott: So here's the one problem that we couldn't answer.

855
00:52:36,131 --> 00:52:43,716
Scott: There's a card that let make forces your opponent to play their card first instead of simultaneously Right on the next turn.

856
00:52:44,277 --> 00:52:46,984
Scott: So I forced Rym to play his card first next turn.

857
00:52:47,024 --> 00:52:48,347
Scott: He does it I play.

858
00:52:48,367 --> 00:52:50,206
Scott: I choose To tie him.

859
00:52:51,111 --> 00:52:54,830
Scott: Okay, we obviously both draw new cards, right?

860
00:52:55,570 --> 00:52:59,003
Scott: But does Rym have to reveal this card to me?

861
00:52:59,023 --> 00:53:00,207
Scott: or was that it?

862
00:53:01,713 --> 00:53:06,650
Scott: It that is on the rule doesn't say so that's really the only thing that was big you.

863
00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:09,941
Rym: I think geek people have a lot more questions that we didn't even run into.

864
00:53:10,041 --> 00:53:12,610
Rym: for example, I replenish tranquilizer bullets.

865
00:53:13,552 --> 00:53:14,075
Scott: No, you have.

866
00:53:14,136 --> 00:53:16,289
Rym: the five scientists die for good.

867
00:53:17,371 --> 00:53:18,394
Scott: No, they don't.

868
00:53:19,076 --> 00:53:22,327
Rym: I think these board game geek people just don't parse rules.

869
00:53:22,367 --> 00:53:23,350
Scott: They just didn't read the rules.

870
00:53:23,592 --> 00:53:28,539
Scott: there's only five bullets in the game and the The Raptor only takes five hits.

871
00:53:28,881 --> 00:53:34,570
Scott: and I'm pretty sure the rule book even says Yeah, when you heal give the things back to the scientists you can shoot you again.

872
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:38,949
Rym: Oh my god, one guy's like I found a degenerate strategy always play your highest card.

873
00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:41,737
Scott: No, no, that is not.

874
00:53:42,078 --> 00:53:43,824
Rym: I will gladly play this game with you Dennis.

875
00:53:44,185 --> 00:53:49,015
Scott: Yes Always playing his highest card.

876
00:53:49,096 --> 00:53:49,959
Scott: Oh, okay.

877
00:53:49,979 --> 00:53:52,670
Rym: Yeah, so no one appears to have asked the questions.

878
00:53:53,831 --> 00:53:58,344
Rym: They're all asking dumb questions that are trivially answered by the rules because they didn't read.

879
00:53:58,725 --> 00:54:02,120
Rym: can fire be placed on occupied spaces Or must they always be placed on empty spaces.

880
00:54:02,261 --> 00:54:08,612
Scott: It says clearly in the rules No two things may be in the same space period ever done It's clear.

881
00:54:09,033 --> 00:54:14,930
Scott: So the rules like 99% or not 99% but like they're really well written compared to a lot of other games.

882
00:54:14,930 --> 00:54:16,174
Scott: I'm not gonna say they're garbage rules.

883
00:54:16,215 --> 00:54:19,044
Scott: No, they're there from it, but they're not perfect.

884
00:54:19,366 --> 00:54:20,590
Rym: They're above average rule.

885
00:54:20,872 --> 00:54:26,387
Rym: They're way above average, you know We ran into more problems with potion explosion than with this game.

886
00:54:26,467 --> 00:54:27,432
Scott: potion explosion Just like.

887
00:54:27,532 --> 00:54:30,346
Scott: I couldn't even right but this game I can even all day now.

888
00:54:30,406 --> 00:54:41,027
Rym: potion explosion I'd say about three quarters of the questions you had were technically answered but in obtuse Confusing or non sequential ways in potion explosion.

889
00:54:41,047 --> 00:54:47,370
Rym: Mmm This one had very few conflicts, but one of them was like we resolved it, but it was kind of unresolvable.

890
00:54:49,011 --> 00:54:52,450
Rym: Mmm, I'll forgive it cuz the game is pretty fun and I like the theme All right.

891
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:59,383
Scott: So if you're looking for a two-player game It's got some depth and some strategy and some dinosaurs asymmetric like take some cops.

892
00:54:59,744 --> 00:55:02,330
Rym: take that like foxes and snakes game.

893
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:05,250
Rym: Yeah, no, that's the one from Wheel of Time the real version of that.

894
00:55:06,233 --> 00:55:07,957
Scott: You can get this game the you know what?

895
00:55:07,997 --> 00:55:12,610
Scott: I think the only negative of this game is that the box is not.

896
00:55:13,751 --> 00:55:15,116
Scott: It's not enormous right.

897
00:55:15,156 --> 00:55:20,924
Scott: it's smaller than like a for, you know, Puerto Rico by which is bigger than it needs to be But it's bigger than it needs to be.

898
00:55:21,005 --> 00:55:26,950
Scott: but more importantly It's even if it's you know, even if you were to shrink the game into a smaller box, you know rebox it.

899
00:55:27,050 --> 00:55:31,942
Scott: Yeah, it's still like Kind of too big for a two-player game.

900
00:55:31,982 --> 00:55:33,850
Scott: It's not portable like a lot of cities.

901
00:55:34,192 --> 00:55:36,670
Rym: I keep battle line in one ziplock bag.

902
00:55:36,755 --> 00:55:44,359
Scott: Yeah You can't keep this game in one ziplock bag because you got to get the tokens and all these little boards and it's like in Cards, so it's like you can get.

903
00:55:44,399 --> 00:55:54,250
Scott: you can probably fit it maybe in something smaller but I still think it's too big for You know to be portable enough for a two-player game and then you have to set it up.

904
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:56,550
Scott: I'm like a table of like substantial size.

905
00:55:56,610 --> 00:55:59,722
Scott: You can't just like like lost cities you can play in like a cafe.

906
00:56:00,144 --> 00:56:01,730
Scott: for this you need like a real table.

907
00:56:01,991 --> 00:56:06,490
Scott: Yeah, it takes up as much space as like a real kind of game, but it's to player.

908
00:56:06,973 --> 00:56:09,710
Scott: So that's sort of like as like this physical problem.

909
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:14,345
Rym: Oh, oh Bruno Cathala is totally in the forum directly answering rules question.

910
00:56:14,365 --> 00:56:16,070
Scott: Well ask asked our two questions.

911
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:17,637
Rym: So for example, someone just asked here.

912
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:20,430
Rym: What do you do if you run out of fire tokens and you play a fire code?

913
00:56:20,913 --> 00:56:22,329
Scott: Oh, that's actually a good question.

914
00:56:22,913 --> 00:56:25,590
Rym: Bruno Cathala quote you ignore the effect.

915
00:56:25,923 --> 00:56:33,256
Scott: Yeah that makes sense because in other parts of the rules it says like if you run out of scientists you can't place any more or Stuff like that.

916
00:56:33,416 --> 00:56:36,010
Rym: now that is remember we did our design and game rules panel.

917
00:56:36,374 --> 00:56:38,030
Rym: That is a good sign.

918
00:56:38,532 --> 00:56:43,950
Rym: if a rule is ambiguous you have to look to other similar situations and see if it's unambiguous.

919
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:53,289
Rym: and As long as all those situations break in a similar direction Then you can reasonably assume the answer to the question even if you don't have Bruno telling you

920
00:56:53,571 --> 00:57:00,789
Scott: Well, so while you're in there just ask about you know If you use the revealing thing and then you tie do you have to reveal the next one?

921
00:57:01,192 --> 00:57:01,777
Scott: Or not?

922
00:57:02,039 --> 00:57:08,880
Rym: dude motherfucker Don't ask him if you can move the rafter Diagonally like that was first thing it says in the rule book.

923
00:57:08,941 --> 00:57:13,495
Scott: is that absolutely nothing in this game ever moves or shoots Diagonally ever under any circumstance.

924
00:57:13,535 --> 00:57:24,530
Rym: the end Bruno answered that one immediately and was like I confirm no diagonal move No diagonal shoot no diagonals everything all at game like no diagonals.

925
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:26,157
Scott: That's the first thing it says in the book.

926
00:57:26,217 --> 00:57:27,784
Scott: Jesus Christ read.

927
00:57:27,925 --> 00:57:28,447
Scott: Oh my god.

928
00:57:28,648 --> 00:57:32,464
Rym: Yeah Anyway, oh my god even in this thread.

929
00:57:32,886 --> 00:57:33,810
Rym: just to clarify.

930
00:57:34,732 --> 00:57:37,949
Rym: So someone else is like, but what if I'm killing or eating is that?

931
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:39,314
Rym: Diagonal like?

932
00:57:39,536 --> 00:57:42,050
Scott: no it says absolutely nothing in the game is diagonal.

933
00:57:42,211 --> 00:57:43,355
Scott: Everything is orthogonal.

934
00:57:43,456 --> 00:57:45,766
Scott: the end god damn board game geek like.

935
00:57:45,866 --> 00:57:47,111
Rym: come on guys Like.

936
00:57:47,152 --> 00:57:49,805
Scott: it's one thing to be a rules lawyer, but to be a rules lawyer.

937
00:57:49,825 --> 00:57:50,910
Scott: You gotta be literate.

938
00:57:52,791 --> 00:57:54,254
Scott: The Lawyers can read.

939
00:57:54,294 --> 00:57:55,378
Scott: that's how they do both.

940
00:57:55,459 --> 00:57:58,752
Rym: Bruno's like post constantly in this farm All right.

941
00:57:58,772 --> 00:58:00,421
Scott: Well, I'm gonna go and post our questions.

942
00:58:00,461 --> 00:58:02,009
Rym: if yeah good on you guys.

943
00:58:02,753 --> 00:58:06,190
Rym: Also, we should I'm just gonna buy lost cities duels and we'll play it into a review of it.

944
00:58:06,190 --> 00:58:08,319
Scott: Cuz you mean seven wonders seven wonders duel.

945
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:11,070
Rym: Yeah, I'll say this is already a duel cuz everyone is duel.

946
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:13,214
Rym: So so great.

947
00:58:13,234 --> 00:58:13,656
Scott: Hmm.

948
00:58:13,816 --> 00:58:16,867
Scott: Also, the power grid card game is not - it might be.

949
00:58:16,968 --> 00:58:17,550
Scott: is it to player?

950
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:21,603
Rym: I Heard tell to player would not be advised.

951
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:23,995
Scott: the point is we played power grid card game But not with two players.

952
00:58:24,035 --> 00:58:28,699
Scott: it was fun and it's power grid without the map But only the other parts of power grid which is fine.

953
00:58:28,719 --> 00:58:31,270
Scott: because I'm fine because the map is the part I like the least.

954
00:58:31,611 --> 00:58:32,757
Rym: I'm tired of the map.

955
00:58:32,938 --> 00:58:34,204
Rym: I have optimized the map.

956
00:58:34,305 --> 00:58:35,370
Rym: I play the map perfectly.

957
00:58:35,711 --> 00:58:41,990
Rym: I don't care like the map is just something that I might fuck up a calculation and be off by one dollar the man.

958
00:58:42,110 --> 00:58:46,588
Scott: So the map actually makes the game more political because someone like blocks you off and like well, fuck me.

959
00:58:46,789 --> 00:58:48,850
Scott: Yeah And turn or you know, whatever.

960
00:58:49,432 --> 00:58:55,570
Rym: So yeah peck south actually brought us many games to review and we skipped all of them to talk about this new game.

961
00:58:55,570 --> 00:58:56,092
Rym: That's pretty good.

962
00:58:56,453 --> 00:58:56,613
Rym: Mm-hmm.

963
00:58:56,914 --> 00:58:57,416
Rym: It's from 2015.

964
00:58:57,416 --> 00:58:58,660
Rym: It's relatively recent.

965
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:01,590
Scott: Uh, I thought it was like super new, but maybe not.

966
00:59:01,951 --> 00:59:04,118
Rym: It's from 2015 according to the BGG.

967
00:59:04,138 --> 00:59:07,830
Scott: Well, I guess it might have gotten reprinted recently and that's why I'll to check.

968
00:59:08,171 --> 00:59:10,138
Rym: Yeah, maybe I do not.

969
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:13,751
Scott: maybe it's was out in 2015 in like Germany and now it's 2015.

970
00:59:13,751 --> 00:59:14,778
Scott: It's gotten published in the US.

971
00:59:14,818 --> 00:59:15,161
Scott: finally.

972
00:59:15,221 --> 00:59:16,389
Scott: Yeah, it could be like that.

973
00:59:17,251 --> 00:59:19,083
Rym: See if there's any note here, but I think I'm done.

974
00:59:19,143 --> 00:59:20,029
Rym: I think we're done with the show.

975
00:59:20,251 --> 00:59:21,818
Scott: All right, you need to player games.

978
00:59:25,575 --> 00:59:29,750

00:59:30,132 --> 00:59:30,718
Scott: Yeah, it made.

Scott: You know what?

982
00:59:32,654 --> 00:59:35,450
Rym: It's better than the moose game by far because the moose games got some problems.

983
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:36,733
Scott: It's better than the moose gaming.
