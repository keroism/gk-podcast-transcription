00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,575
Rym: It's Thursday, June 22nd 2017.

2
00:00:10,575 --> 00:00:13,483
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:16,492 --> 00:00:17,538
Rym: We'll see how this goes.

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,449
Rym: We're talking about predicaments.

5
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,208
Rym: Let's do this.

6
00:00:24,641 --> 00:00:25,423
Scott: So work today.

7
00:00:25,443 --> 00:00:28,072
Scott: I go to pee like you do.

8
00:00:28,092 --> 00:00:30,139
Scott: Yeah, like you do and I go to the urinal.

9
00:00:30,621 --> 00:00:32,350
Rym: I feel like three times a day at work.

10
00:00:32,531 --> 00:00:34,100
Scott: Yeah, I feel a lot of work as they drink too much water.

11
00:00:35,005 --> 00:00:37,196
Rym: In fact the more I'm working the more water I drink.

12
00:00:37,216 --> 00:00:44,700
Scott: like if I'm working hard I'm just like chugging water anyway, so You know, it's one of those urinals that has a tiny pool of water at the bottom.

13
00:00:44,941 --> 00:00:55,838
Scott: you know, not that not the kind with the disc or the the waterless kind like they do right and Sometimes people don't flush fully or the flusher is kind of like the flusher.

14
00:00:55,898 --> 00:00:58,419
Scott: on this one You have to sort of push it down really hard and hold it.

15
00:00:58,661 --> 00:01:07,580
Scott: Yeah, if you just sort of bump it once it goes like and it doesn't flush So quite often when you go in the water will be yellow, which is really not a big deal.

16
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:09,351
Scott: Yeah, it's like I don't really care.

17
00:01:09,372 --> 00:01:10,620
Scott: You know, it happens to everyone.

18
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:20,620
Scott: I'm super paranoid though, like whenever I'm in a public bathroom of any kind, especially the work one I always like, you know get up before I leave the stall or walk away from the toilet.

19
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,651
Scott: I look at it to make sure it's completely flushed.

20
00:01:22,872 --> 00:01:31,579
Scott: Yeah, then after I wash my hands I got I almost had to double-check and Occasionally like I'll leave the stall wash my hands and someone will be in the stall now and I can't check.

21
00:01:32,445 --> 00:01:34,459
Scott: Oh, no, did that person just see my poop?

22
00:01:35,682 --> 00:01:39,600
Rym: But anyway, I'd be almost proud of it if they saw it be like, all right, you saw my mighty works.

23
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,047
Rym: I'm just very mighty upon my work.

24
00:01:42,107 --> 00:01:44,755
Scott: I'm just paranoid about being and despair.

25
00:01:44,775 --> 00:01:45,859
Scott: I know that I don't flush.

26
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:49,960
Scott: Oh, no Don't flush even though I'm super paranoid about flushing all the time.

27
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,204
Scott: Anyway, so

28
00:01:51,224 --> 00:01:58,240
Rym: I watched a dude not flush and not wash his hands and walk the fuck out and he works on my floor Not in my company though some other company

29
00:01:58,626 --> 00:01:59,379
Scott: Saying if he were if

30
00:02:00,961 --> 00:02:01,804
Rym: My company

31
00:02:01,884 --> 00:02:07,260
Scott: if I was a boss and someone did that I talked to him once I'd say wash your goddamn hands.

32
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:10,616
Scott: I mean if I saw him do it again fired, I would do something different.

33
00:02:10,656 --> 00:02:11,420
Scott: It was not a restaurant.

34
00:02:11,481 --> 00:02:12,025
Rym: I would just send it.

35
00:02:12,086 --> 00:02:17,033
Rym: if it was a restaurant fired immediately I would just send an email to team and be like guess who doesn't fucking wash his hands.

36
00:02:17,394 --> 00:02:17,976
Scott: That's part of it.

37
00:02:17,996 --> 00:02:18,960
Scott: Yeah anyway.

38
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,214
Scott: So I go and you know the waters yellow, which is a big deal.

39
00:02:24,295 --> 00:02:24,857
Scott: I'm gonna.

40
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:26,102
Scott: I don't know whose water Is.

41
00:02:26,343 --> 00:02:30,784
Scott: let it mellow it's there I'll flush it and then I'll pee and then I'll Why flush NP?

42
00:02:30,824 --> 00:02:31,789
Rym: Why not pee then flush?

43
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:32,653
Rym: It's not gonna get on you.

44
00:02:32,874 --> 00:02:33,899
Scott: I'm gonna tell you why.

45
00:02:34,601 --> 00:02:39,186
Scott: Obviously, it's not likely to get on me But there is the chance I can see.

46
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:40,230
Rym: that I can see.

47
00:02:40,712 --> 00:02:42,900
Scott: well, even if it was just normal tea.

48
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:43,806
Rym: Wait, did it get on you?

49
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:45,919
Scott: No, okay, I flushed and then I peed.

50
00:02:48,148 --> 00:02:57,426
Scott: Where the story's going the color of this P now I Know eating various foods.

51
00:02:57,627 --> 00:03:01,440
Scott: Yeah, right and I've seen red pee because someone's got a problem, right?

52
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,771
Scott: They can go to the hospital probably if you got red.

53
00:03:03,852 --> 00:03:07,459
Rym: a friend of ours who was on chemo Like her pee was basically bright pink during all of that.

54
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,244
Scott: Yeah, I've seen.

55
00:03:08,304 --> 00:03:08,565
Scott: I've seen.

56
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:11,520
Rym: I show just did an episode on what different colors of pee mean.

57
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:14,880
Scott: Yeah, I've seen a blue pee even in my life, right?

58
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:15,803
Rym: I peed a weird.

59
00:03:15,864 --> 00:03:23,904
Rym: I was on a weird antibiotic once and my pee was like Bright green to the point that I called the doctor and I was like yo and he was like, yeah Yeah, I should have warned you

60
00:03:24,225 --> 00:03:27,536
Scott: this P was a color I had not seen in my 35 years of life.

61
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:28,823
Rym: What's the?

62
00:03:28,844 --> 00:03:30,099
Rym: what's the Xcode for it?

63
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:36,756
Scott: So it was yellow and you might be saying well yellow But that's like the color piece supposed to be the least surprising pee color.

64
00:03:36,897 --> 00:03:40,950
Scott: Yeah, right No, it was yellow like a fucking yellow highlighter.

65
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:44,420
Scott: I thought whoa, somebody just dropped a highlighter in there.

66
00:03:44,521 --> 00:03:45,587
Scott: I was like, is that even pee?

67
00:03:45,728 --> 00:03:47,660
Scott: I thought maybe it was some kind of cleaning chemical.

68
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,720
Rym: Maybe maybe the company we're gonna talk about in the news.

69
00:03:50,941 --> 00:03:54,293
Scott: I thought it like maybe wasn't pee like it was a cleaning chemical or something.

70
00:03:54,353 --> 00:03:56,300
Scott: and and I would just like flush this away.

71
00:03:57,027 --> 00:03:58,300
Scott: I flush it and it's still there.

72
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,220
Scott: It's probably some thing they installed in the toilet right to put this chemical in there, but no it went away.

73
00:04:03,721 --> 00:04:06,469
Scott: Someone's pee was highlighter fucking yellow.

74
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:08,475
Rym: I'm like, maybe they ate a highlighter.

75
00:04:08,635 --> 00:04:09,979
Scott: I don't know what it wasn't.

76
00:04:10,723 --> 00:04:11,105
Scott: I don't know.

77
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,076
Scott: I don't know how it was that way.

78
00:04:13,096 --> 00:04:13,820
Scott: It was in a urinal.

79
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,734
Scott: It wasn't like someone dropped something in a sit-down.

80
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,564
Scott: What is up with that?

81
00:04:18,624 --> 00:04:19,607
Scott: like what that's?

82
00:04:19,628 --> 00:04:20,731
Rym: that's pretty that's good.

00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:22,417
Scott: is that explained in your little video there.

84
00:04:22,457 --> 00:04:23,420
Scott: highlighter yellow pee.

85
00:04:23,601 --> 00:04:24,766
Rym: I haven't actually watched this yet.

86
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,072
Rym: It's in my queue of videos to watch.

87
00:04:26,112 --> 00:04:27,097

Rym: Okay.

Rym: Look I can see they talk about Orange red red blood.

92
00:04:37,621 --> 00:04:40,591
Scott: Yeah, it's bad news, uh green yeah, we've talked about green.

93
00:04:40,672 --> 00:04:44,614
Scott: hang we talked about that green again blue I told you we talked about blue.

94
00:04:44,634 --> 00:04:47,252
Rym: Yep, a Purple urine bag syndrome.

95
00:04:47,312 --> 00:04:48,199
Scott: I've never heard of that.

96
00:04:48,219 --> 00:04:49,086
Scott: my fuck.

97
00:04:51,141 --> 00:04:53,528
Rym: This is a long article some sort of off-white.

98
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,915
Scott: I mean, I have clear pee a lot black.

99
00:04:56,035 --> 00:04:57,500
Scott: Oh god, you'd squid ink.

100
00:04:57,703 --> 00:04:58,520
Scott: I don't know black.

101
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,447
Rym: I guess I just got if I file.

102
00:05:00,507 --> 00:05:03,036
Scott: if maybe your bile from your poop lines leaks into you.

103
00:05:03,096 --> 00:05:07,274
Rym: if I pee and it's black I literally just without calling anyone or saying a word.

104
00:05:07,294 --> 00:05:08,580
Rym: I just go straight to a hospital.

105
00:05:08,922 --> 00:05:10,629
Scott: I call 9-1-1 while I'm walking to the.

106
00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:13,100
Rym: I just go straight to a hospital and be like take a picture.

107
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,370
Rym: I would go straight to the hospital and be like Deal with this.

108
00:05:16,492 --> 00:05:19,928
Scott: I peed black Not highlighter yellow a.

109
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,220
Rym: I didn't see a highlighter yellow in there anywhere.

110
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:25,713
Scott: Like I should have taken a picture because it was maybe that bright one there.

111
00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:26,937
Scott: That looks more green.

112
00:05:27,178 --> 00:05:29,647
Scott: Yeah Well, oh maybe though could be cool.

113
00:05:29,687 --> 00:05:30,309
Rym: It's the brights.

114
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:31,733
Rym: the motion you get highlighter.

115
00:05:31,773 --> 00:05:33,840
Scott: yellow starts to become neon green eventually.

116
00:05:34,021 --> 00:05:36,880
Scott: Yeah, you go along the spectrum there, but I don't know if chemicals work.

117
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,633
Rym: I'll watch this video tonight because it's literally in my like.

118
00:05:39,674 --> 00:05:40,920
Rym: you have YouTube videos to watch.

119
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,900
Rym: Yeah, cuz I don't you know, I don't watch these immediately.

120
00:05:43,081 --> 00:05:44,326
Rym: Let all my subscriptions queue up.

121
00:05:44,506 --> 00:05:46,213
Scott: that was the most surprising thing that happened.

122
00:05:46,233 --> 00:05:57,320
Rym: today was seeing high letter yellow P In the office, darling, so you might have noticed that the other night two nights ago We did the show and you know I stream most of GeekNights and I didn't stream that episode like a tweet in stream most episodes.

123
00:05:57,481 --> 00:06:00,171
Rym: We started streaming almost every episode because it's like real easy to do.

124
00:06:00,211 --> 00:06:00,633
Rym: Okay.

125
00:06:01,135 --> 00:06:13,904
Rym: Uh, the reason I didn't stream Is that we were trying to start the show and every time I launched audition OBS would crash Mm-hmm or hang and every time I launched OBS Audition would hang.

126
00:06:14,045 --> 00:06:15,812
Scott: just use X split or whatever.

127
00:06:16,033 --> 00:06:17,399
Rym: X split would also have hung.

128
00:06:18,404 --> 00:06:19,290
Rym: So interesting.

129
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,195
Rym: I knew that.

130
00:06:20,356 --> 00:06:21,823
Rym: so here's the deal I learned.

131
00:06:21,884 --> 00:06:25,540
Rym: I like figured out exactly what's going on and it's because OBS is doing something didn't expect.

132
00:06:25,901 --> 00:06:33,205
Rym: So if you have for real audio hardware, like you're muxing a giant like audio interface You'll won't use MME.

133
00:06:33,285 --> 00:06:34,990
Rym: the windows like multimedia, whatever.

134
00:06:35,551 --> 00:06:37,516
Rym: MME is the thing that windows does.

135
00:06:37,937 --> 00:06:38,980
Rym: that for the love of God.

136
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,337
Rym: Why can't Linux just do this?

137
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:48,563
Rym: Where if you have like ten sound cards, which you might not think you have a lot of sound cards But in the modern era you actually have a lot of sound cards Don't realize it?

138
00:06:49,086 --> 00:06:52,420
Rym: every monitor that takes HDMI is a sound card technically.

139
00:06:52,681 --> 00:06:56,271
Rym: Yep, every headphone that you plug in with USB.

140
00:06:56,492 --> 00:06:57,334
Rym: That's a sound card.

141
00:06:57,835 --> 00:06:59,400
Rym: Your motherboard probably is a sound card.

142
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,855
Rym: You even know about if there's like an audio jack in there.

143
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:02,479
Rym: There might be two.

144
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:10,200
Rym: MME just makes all those work all at the same time, but you can't record from all of them at the same time.

145
00:07:11,021 --> 00:07:12,004
Rym: There's all these issues.

146
00:07:12,606 --> 00:07:14,893
Rym: one you pick the one that you're recording bag.

147
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:16,920
Scott: You can only play to one at the same time.

148
00:07:17,107 --> 00:07:23,862
Scott: Yeah Unless you install some bullshit software that's all those by default only plays to one and records to one and all the other ones are Just off.

149
00:07:24,203 --> 00:07:28,080
Rym: and if you do if you do if you install weird you can record from one and play on a different one.

150
00:07:28,205 --> 00:07:31,900
Scott: Yeah You just can't have two of them recording at the same time or two of them playing it.

151
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,718
Rym: You might be able to have two different pieces of software that don't interact working with two different sound cards.

152
00:07:36,758 --> 00:07:37,280
Rym: that could happen.

153
00:07:37,601 --> 00:07:38,224
Scott: Oh, you can do that.

154
00:07:38,244 --> 00:07:42,761
Scott: Yeah, you can have one piece that you can have iTunes play sound on one and YouTube play sound on Another.

155
00:07:42,942 --> 00:07:46,897
Rym: yep, like my rig right my my streaming thing or my my headset.

156
00:07:47,238 --> 00:07:48,663
Rym: I have Overwatch.

157
00:07:48,683 --> 00:07:53,540
Rym: like audio will come in one interface to it, but the voice chat comes into another one.

158
00:07:53,540 --> 00:08:01,099
Rym: Like you can do the stuff like you just can't like play a song in iTunes and have it play out of like five Different speaker, but if you have pro audio equipment, I can totally do that.

159
00:08:01,704 --> 00:08:03,680
Rym: I can route audio all over the fuck place.

160
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,100
Scott: Especially the hardware outside of your computer can do it too, right?

161
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,890
Scott: So send the audio out of your computer into another device.

162
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,436
Scott: that device can plug in a million.

163
00:08:11,477 --> 00:08:14,170
Scott: Whatever is Windows remember in the old days.

164
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,080
Rym: We used to get guests on GeekNights.

165
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:19,177
Rym: I did not have the like kind of mixer that I have today.

166
00:08:19,237 --> 00:08:24,800
Rym: back then The way we did that is by having all these different sound cards like Skype little computer.

167
00:08:25,021 --> 00:08:34,740
Rym: Skype was using one sound card on one computer and like Skype - is using a different sound card on another computer And I like analog mixed all that shit together.

168
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:39,774
Rym: Anyway, if you have for real audio hardware, you won't use MME.

169
00:08:40,095 --> 00:08:41,539
Rym: you use something called ASIO.

170
00:08:41,861 --> 00:08:48,739
Rym: Yep, if you're if you want to fuck shit up you use was API which is like bootleg ghetto windows.

171
00:08:48,939 --> 00:08:50,966
Rym: shit ASIO don't use it.

172
00:08:51,247 --> 00:08:54,680
Rym: Remember that time when I needed help in MATLAB to fix an episode of GeekNights?

173
00:08:54,982 --> 00:08:56,010
Rym: That was because I was happy.

174
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,058
Rym: don't use was happy ever.

175
00:08:58,074 --> 00:09:14,178
Rym: anyway ASIO lets you do magic But it has one very specific limitation only one piece of software can in a sense subscribe to any given specific channel of audio.

176
00:09:15,043 --> 00:09:26,380
Rym: So audition right now is recording the raw Output from channel one of the mixer which is me and the raw output of channel two of the mixer Which is Scott and that is independent of the faders.

177
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:27,605
Rym: I move the faders around.

178
00:09:27,906 --> 00:09:31,280
Rym: that'll mess with the stream, but it won't actually mess with what's recorded.

179
00:09:31,381 --> 00:09:33,996
Rym: The recording is raw because I don't want anything.

180
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:44,984
Rym: nothing I do live should affect the raw recording cuz I do everything in post kind of like how if Scott's recording video He doesn't want to like do digital zooms or effects in camera He's gonna do that shit in post.

181
00:09:45,225 --> 00:09:47,754
Rym: don't ruin your actual like source material.

182
00:09:47,774 --> 00:09:48,357
Rym: Mm-hmm.

183
00:09:48,939 --> 00:09:54,779
Rym: So I set up an advanced war stream and I happen to set it up to record a raw channel.

184
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:02,400
Rym: The OBS stream I do GeekNights on is actually recording the main mix that is affected by the faders because it's going through the compressor.

185
00:10:02,481 --> 00:10:03,388
Rym: So I have a live effect.

186
00:10:03,429 --> 00:10:04,619
Rym: So that is also compressed.

187
00:10:05,262 --> 00:10:07,433
Rym: Otherwise, it'd be like the audio would be all over the place.

188
00:10:07,694 --> 00:10:09,000
Rym: It'd be hard for you to listen to in the streaming.

189
00:10:09,081 --> 00:10:09,968
Rym: That's why it sounds good.

190
00:10:09,988 --> 00:10:19,548
Rym: Ah OBS apparently if you define any audio source, even if it's not being used in X split I checked seems to do the same thing.

191
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:21,700
Rym: So don't say like Oh exploit would fix this.

192
00:10:22,642 --> 00:10:28,289
Rym: Even though I was not using that like that set up I wasn't recording or anything because it was configured.

193
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,740
Rym: OBS subscribes to every single audio source.

194
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,122
Rym: It knows about mm-hmm.

195
00:10:33,222 --> 00:10:36,808
Rym: So it subscribed to a source that was also in my audition thing.

196
00:10:37,068 --> 00:10:38,290
Rym: So they would both hang each other.

197
00:10:39,401 --> 00:10:40,324
Rym: Why do they hang each other?

198
00:10:40,685 --> 00:10:46,000
Rym: because ASIO drivers are super finicky because they're only used in like super pro set up.

199
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,812
Scott: Yeah, wouldn't you write in the code of OBS or in the code of audition?

200
00:10:48,832 --> 00:10:50,820
Scott: Like if cannot subscribe.

201
00:10:51,482 --> 00:10:54,773
Scott: Fail gracefully put up a message about not being able to subscribe.

202
00:10:54,813 --> 00:10:55,375
Scott: don't crash.

203
00:10:55,616 --> 00:11:02,927
Rym: you'd think that You would really think that now audition will depending on how it fails.

204
00:11:02,947 --> 00:11:10,088
Rym: because the problem is it can actually fail in a bunch of different ways and the real problem is that The ASIO drivers are highly hardware specific.

205
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:20,460
Rym: So I have specific drivers for this exact hardware and I also have specific drivers for my exact firewire and that shits all old.

206
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,545
Rym: It isn't being updated that much thus.

207
00:11:22,626 --> 00:11:23,448
Rym: It just sort of hangs.

208
00:11:23,728 --> 00:11:33,160
Rym: the moral is bugs No matter how weird and obscure or difficult to troubleshoot can always be troubleshooted by using basic troubleshooting techniques.

209
00:11:33,623 --> 00:11:40,100
Rym: I'd looked at what was different between the last time I streamed in that time And the only thing that was different was I made it advanced for a stream.

210
00:11:40,502 --> 00:11:42,230
Rym: So that was how I was able to troubleshoot that.

211
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,140
Rym: and now we're streaming the show again, whatever.

212
00:11:45,324 --> 00:11:51,669
Rym: that is also why Scott is occasionally silent in the very beginning of the show because I usually haven't muted in the main mix because I'm not using that microphone all the time.

213
00:11:52,334 --> 00:11:53,260
Rym: So anyway, you got some news.

214
00:11:55,063 --> 00:11:55,689
Scott: What was my news?

215
00:11:55,730 --> 00:12:01,960
Scott: All right, so You know, we talked about Star Wars a bunch because there's a lot more Star Wars now than there's ever been.

216
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,831
Scott: Yeah, every year we're gonna get some Star Wars.

217
00:12:04,871 --> 00:12:07,280
Scott: It's a Star Wars bonanza every single year.

218
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,732
Scott: There's gonna be a Star Wars in one of the upcoming years.

219
00:12:09,792 --> 00:12:10,757
Scott: I think maybe next year, right?

220
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:18,298
Scott: Because this year is this year's gonna be episode eight eight Yes, eight eight.

221
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:28,869
Rym: It's weird that like until before the new Star Wars came I could immediately say exactly which number but now I got to count up Because there's so many and it's weird.

222
00:12:28,909 --> 00:12:39,720
Rym: Next year is gonna be Han Solo Han Solo, which because of how good rogue squadron, not rogue squadron, Rogue One was I was really looking forward to the Han Solo movie.

223
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,949
Scott: I mean, I'm just I'm like young.

224
00:12:42,009 --> 00:12:44,600
Rym: Lando Calrissian just signed me the fuck up, right?

225
00:12:44,701 --> 00:12:46,880
Scott: I mean, I wasn't like super looking forward to it.

226
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:51,060
Scott: It wasn't like on my hype list, but like I was definitely gonna go right to the theater and see it.

227
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,331
Scott: Yeah, see me some Han Solo.

228
00:12:53,512 --> 00:12:55,240
Rym: I'm pretty much going to all these Star Wars movies.

229
00:12:55,402 --> 00:12:57,140
Scott: Give me the full-on Wookie action, right?

230
00:12:57,501 --> 00:12:58,366
Scott: So, you know, it was.

231
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:00,780
Scott: it was definitely something I was gonna go do a nerdy thing.

232
00:13:01,182 --> 00:13:09,939
Scott: That was uh, you know gonna happen at some point, but yep Apparently it's got some drama some pretty surprising drama, right?

233
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,108
Scott: Like I didn't see this coming.

234
00:13:12,148 --> 00:13:15,060
Scott: I'd like they were just rolling right along Disney with all these other.

235
00:13:15,481 --> 00:13:16,786
Scott: You know Star Wars movies.

236
00:13:16,806 --> 00:13:20,920
Scott: just putting them out, you know, none of them have been bad since the prequel movies, right?

237
00:13:21,381 --> 00:13:23,880
Scott: So just rolling along it seemed like everything was going great.

238
00:13:23,941 --> 00:13:25,979
Scott: They got tons of money and they're profiting.

239
00:13:26,201 --> 00:13:29,800
Rym: You didn't see a lot of like Hollywood drama coming out of the productions, right?

240
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:41,251
Scott: Suddenly we get this news that over creative differences who know what creative differences there could be at a Han Solo movie between two Directors you make a badass Han Solo who goes around space.

241
00:13:41,271 --> 00:13:44,300
Rym: Han soloing you make it even more badass Lando Calrissian.

242
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,560
Scott: Who's just there fucking shit up making you wish it was a Lando Calrissian movie.

243
00:13:47,821 --> 00:13:48,986
Rym: I I feel like you know what they need.

244
00:13:49,167 --> 00:13:54,909
Rym: and then if we make sure Shubaka gets most of the screen time I want them to make a show like far like 13 episodes.

245
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:55,893
Rym: It's just Lando.

246
00:13:56,214 --> 00:13:56,515
Rym: Sure.

247
00:13:57,198 --> 00:13:57,860
Scott: Just call it Lando.

248
00:13:58,621 --> 00:14:00,216
Rym: That's exactly you call it Lando.

249
00:14:00,822 --> 00:14:08,011
Scott: Colin works every time But you The directors had some directors.

250
00:14:08,032 --> 00:14:09,940
Scott: there were two of them the Lord and Chris Miller.

251
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:11,752
Scott: I guess we're let go.

252
00:14:11,772 --> 00:14:12,880
Rym: they had from the movie.

253
00:14:13,101 --> 00:14:16,340
Scott: How could you have creative differences over a Han Solo movie and yeah.

254
00:14:16,641 --> 00:14:18,468
Scott: and then they bring in what.

255
00:14:18,669 --> 00:14:27,400
Rym: maybe what if the only thing I can think of is one of them is Han shot and is a stone-cold fucking killer and the other one is like Lucas style Han Solo reboot?

256
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:34,909
Scott: No I get the feeling was differences but like I feel like the two of them agreed and then but the two of them Disagreed with Disney somehow why?

257
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:36,616
Rym: so I have the exact quote here.

258
00:14:36,656 --> 00:14:37,780
Rym: I found a more recent article.

259
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:40,167
Scott: Oh the move comes two days.

260
00:14:40,468 --> 00:14:41,210
Rym: So the move is.

261
00:14:41,491 --> 00:14:47,880
Scott: they hired a third new director Ron Howard Which is a famous person that I. I know the name of this famous person.

262
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:52,280
Scott: I know they're a famous Hollywood person if you're only not until we did research before the show.

263
00:14:52,401 --> 00:14:53,729
Scott: Could I have told you anything about him?

264
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:55,379
Rym: I know he's a really wood person.

265
00:14:55,941 --> 00:15:00,517
Rym: What I'm curious how many of you know him as fucking Opie from the Andy Griffiths.

266
00:15:00,537 --> 00:15:01,320
Scott: Probably everyone.

267
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:12,750
Rym: We just don't know about Hollywood, but as an aside the Andy Griffiths the show is super legit And if you've never seen it It's a. it's a really good show like.

268
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:22,479
Rym: it's a really good sitcom and he played the kid But anyway, so he has been tapped to take over the direction, which is good because he's a well-known good director.

269
00:15:22,539 --> 00:15:28,136
Rym: fine After directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller were let go from the movie so they didn't quit.

270
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,260
Rym: they were fucking fired.

271
00:15:30,521 --> 00:15:32,687
Rym: They had spent four and a half months directing.

272
00:15:32,887 --> 00:15:43,242
Rym: they've already filmed a whole bunch of shit - right creative differences over style and Tone came to a head between them and a separate person Lawrence Kasdan.

273
00:15:43,282 --> 00:15:48,778
Rym: I have no idea who that is Disney executive who has the studio backing and screenwriter or something.

274
00:15:48,798 --> 00:15:49,159
Rym: Mm-hmm.

275
00:15:49,761 --> 00:15:52,960
Rym: So yeah, there's a whole bunch of follow-up drama that I don't know about.

276
00:15:53,120 --> 00:16:02,420
Scott: I mean the thing that you would guess would just be that one of the parties wanted sort of like a light Adventure fun time and the other person wanted a more serious badass kind of time.

277
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:07,268
Scott: I could see that there were like a 60s Batman versus a night, you know 80s 90s back.

278
00:16:07,288 --> 00:16:08,170
Scott: You know what the problem is.

279
00:16:10,363 --> 00:16:11,649
Scott: Yeah, I don't give a shit either.

280
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:12,091
Scott: one of those.

281
00:16:12,152 --> 00:16:19,991
Rym: so both in the same movie for all I care It should be both in the same movie have a roller coaster tone Like it's silly and campy, but then hon just fucking murders a guy.

282
00:16:20,071 --> 00:16:22,098
Scott: That's how the original Star Wars was.

283
00:16:22,158 --> 00:16:24,998
Scott: It's super It's campy, but he also just fucking murders a guy.

284
00:16:25,704 --> 00:16:27,820
Scott: It's both at the same time and that's what it should be.

285
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,760
Scott: So if they're fighting if they're having that fight, which is just a guess who knows what the fight was, right?

286
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,128
Scott: If that's the fight they're having they're both wrong.

287
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,278
Scott: Yeah, but I don't care who is gonna.

288
00:16:36,318 --> 00:16:36,539
Scott: here we go.

289
00:16:36,861 --> 00:16:39,560
Rym: Howard is considered a safe choice to complete the task.

290
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:44,456
Rym: Sure, someone who will ably finish the movie while being a calming presence on sets.

291
00:16:45,058 --> 00:16:45,640
Scott: Yeah, probably.

292
00:16:45,801 --> 00:16:51,520
Rym: So basically the kids had a fight so they hired and a famous adult to come in and be like, alright We're gonna go buy the book.

293
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:59,680
Rym: So I feel like my worry is I feel like the movie will be competent now But won't push any envelopes that it might have pushed with a more maverick team.

294
00:17:00,021 --> 00:17:03,919
Scott: I think it'll also be weird and that so much of the movies already been made.

295
00:17:04,925 --> 00:17:07,400
Scott: How much can they get it to you know?

296
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:12,260
Scott: Not be awkward like having a scene that was shot with one mood trying to make a different mood.

297
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,813
Scott: But then again, we have things like shining the feel-good movie trailer.

298
00:17:16,154 --> 00:17:17,839
Scott: So the power of editing is vast.

299
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,325
Scott: Also, I'm sure they can do it.

300
00:17:19,365 --> 00:17:24,160
Rym: they got Disney movie they can just reshoot and Ron Howard has enough gravitas to be like.

301
00:17:24,281 --> 00:17:25,566
Rym: Nope, you're doing it this way.

302
00:17:25,906 --> 00:17:27,493
Rym: We're throwing out everything you film in certain.

303
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:28,880
Rym: Oh, you could totally do whatever he wants.

304
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,067
Scott: I'll make the money back.

305
00:17:30,147 --> 00:17:30,550
Scott: I'm sure.

306
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:41,500
Scott: Yeah, they could just put Someone who looks like Han Solo on screen and have a little you know Plastic Millennium Falcon toy move back and forth and then someone makes some Chewbacca noises here.

307
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,092
Scott: I would pay ten bucks to see it.

308
00:17:44,212 --> 00:17:46,749
Rym: I'm still gonna go see it day one The only things that would cause me.

309
00:17:46,769 --> 00:17:48,280
Scott: maybe not day one but day early.

310
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:51,657
Rym: I'll go see it like one of the one of the earliest days week one.

311
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,991
Rym: Yeah, cuz day one I'm not doing midnight showings anymore.

312
00:17:54,012 --> 00:17:55,220
Scott: Definitely one of the earlier.

313
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,859
Rym: I'll do like the Friday after work like the week it comes out.

314
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,464
Scott: Yeah, if it depends if it's a Christmas one or a different part of the May 25th, I think yeah I'll just go see it like the week of.

315
00:18:04,644 --> 00:18:07,955
Rym: yeah, but I will not go see it right away.

316
00:18:07,975 --> 00:18:14,482
Rym: if Ron Howard also quits Cuz that means shit went down It's.

317
00:18:14,522 --> 00:18:16,333
Scott: I guess that's just the biggest nerd news there is.

318
00:18:16,454 --> 00:18:17,419
Rym: or if Lando isn't in it.

319
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,971
Scott: So we had to say something about if Lando or Chewbacca in it.

320
00:18:21,131 --> 00:18:21,713
Scott: They're in it.

321
00:18:21,894 --> 00:18:25,339
Rym: Yeah, so unless Ron Howard gets fired I feel like we're just still gonna go see this.

322
00:18:25,581 --> 00:18:28,660
Scott: Why wouldn't we we'd go see it even if everyone was fired and they started over.

323
00:18:28,869 --> 00:18:40,676
Rym: Yeah So there's a news here and I didn't see this picture until someone sent it to me in a in a chat where we talked About all the scary politics that would scare a lot of you if we talked about it on Twitter.

324
00:18:41,158 --> 00:18:43,864
Rym: So anyway I'm looking at the picture right now.

325
00:18:43,904 --> 00:18:45,570
Rym: So if you're watching the live stream, you can see it.

326
00:18:46,272 --> 00:18:53,389
Rym: This picture is actually like Super super fucking terrifying if you know what it's a picture of.

327
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:57,260
Rym: Mm-hmm because it is a picture of four cylinders of plutonium.

328
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,508
Scott: Plutonium just looks like metal by the way.

329
00:18:59,548 --> 00:19:01,176
Rym: Plutonium is a metal unless you like.

330
00:19:01,217 --> 00:19:01,920
Rym: there are salts of it.

331
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,507
Rym: There are chemicals of its radioactive.

332
00:19:03,547 --> 00:19:06,139
Scott: So it goes away slowly, but it's not that fast.

333
00:19:07,281 --> 00:19:14,320
Rym: It's not like it just disappears while you're looking at it, but not to get too deep into How that what the scary thing about this picture is.

334
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:28,527
Rym: But if you really want to know because I know nuclear weapons and nuclear stuff is kind of a slightly more scary thing Today than it might have been say before the election last year Not a lot of big scary thing but like one step

335
00:19:28,548 --> 00:19:35,244
Scott: scary scares people more than it should because of history and also Science fiction.

336
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:46,302
Rym: Yeah books and movies and but if you want to know why this is scary Google for the Wikipedia article or the Wikipedia page about something called the demon core because basically there's a concept of Criticality.

337
00:19:46,683 --> 00:19:54,868
Rym: if you have a nuclear material like plutonium or enriched uranium and you have too much of it in a small enough space Yeah, it's radioactive, but it's not gonna nuke.

338
00:19:55,049 --> 00:19:56,394
Rym: It's just radioactive.

339
00:19:56,434 --> 00:20:00,565
Rym: Like it's not great to hang out around it No, but it's just radioactive.

340
00:20:00,705 --> 00:20:04,032
Scott: right if you put too much bananas radioactive.

341
00:20:04,073 --> 00:20:05,977
Scott: It's like sitting in a banana warehouse.

342
00:20:06,398 --> 00:20:11,476
Rym: Yeah The Yiga clan yes, maybe that's why they're all weird.

343
00:20:11,597 --> 00:20:25,520
Rym: Yes But if you put too much of this material in a in the wrong shape too close to itself There is a critical mass of the components like of this element and fission occurs.

344
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:31,160
Rym: Yes, such that fission occurs and fission occurs in less than a second less than a millisecond.

345
00:20:31,501 --> 00:20:35,620
Rym: So you'll have a material that is not great to hang around but totally okay.

346
00:20:35,782 --> 00:20:41,600
Scott: Like you can stand there and be fine You can wear like a lead armor or have a shield like between you and it or whatever.

347
00:20:41,801 --> 00:20:46,063
Rym: but the terrifying thing is that these are sitting here and they're Cylinders.

348
00:20:46,424 --> 00:20:56,040
Rym: if someone bumped to this table and this one in the middle Rolled a little bit to the left and touch this other one you would get what is called a criticality excursion.

349
00:20:56,522 --> 00:21:01,220
Rym: That means that in a flash in a fraction of a second everyone standing there would be dead.

350
00:21:01,542 --> 00:21:06,066
Rym: Every single person in that room is Is it is already dead?

351
00:21:06,327 --> 00:21:11,680
Rym: They will actually die in a week or two, but there is no radiation poisoning.

352
00:21:11,881 --> 00:21:13,064
Rym: Yes, they are dead.

353
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:16,816
Scott: Even if they're wearing all sorts of nice anti radioactive armors and shields.

354
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:18,000
Scott: It's too much radiation.

355
00:21:18,301 --> 00:21:18,541
Scott: They're dead.

356
00:21:18,561 --> 00:21:27,055
Rym: whoever took this picture is very lucky to be alive and should never be anywhere near nuclear material again ever.

357
00:21:28,123 --> 00:21:32,371
Scott: And Why not take a picture of just one plutonium?

358
00:21:32,732 --> 00:21:34,939
Scott: Why do you have to take a picture of four plutonium's?

359
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,204
Scott: Why not just one?

360
00:21:36,244 --> 00:21:37,752
Scott: the picture of one isn't good enough.

361
00:21:37,772 --> 00:21:39,359
Rym: Did you did you not know?

362
00:21:40,281 --> 00:21:41,930
Rym: Like did you just not like how?

363
00:21:42,252 --> 00:21:43,760
Scott: and you you're a photographer?

364
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,400
Scott: You don't anything about your excuse for knowing anything about radiation, right?

365
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:52,640
Scott: But you're in a place where they're keeping plutonium's where the most expert people are.

366
00:21:53,640 --> 00:22:02,460
Rym: Shouldn't they not give you yes Oh Scott the demon core the reason I'd linked it I'm talking about that is because a lot of the times this happened probably the most pain.

367
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,252
Rym: There's one core that killed a bunch of people.

368
00:22:05,634 --> 00:22:08,387
Rym: We eventually used it in a nuke Mm-hmm, I think they use it.

369
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:12,920
Rym: But anyway, one of the testing ones an island somewhere Uh, so not on an island on land.

370
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:18,300
Rym: But the way this killed some people was that they had it the two halves of it.

371
00:22:18,581 --> 00:22:25,724
Rym: They were like holding them together and they were holding them apart with a flathead screwdriver that they were just holding in the middle to Keep them from touching.

372
00:22:26,307 --> 00:22:27,271
Scott: So they're like too close.

373
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:29,462
Rym: It's like a Pac Man, but it's fine That's.

374
00:22:29,502 --> 00:22:30,629
Rym: how does the tolerance are?

375
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:34,687
Rym: it's like a Pac Man, but they have a screwdriver Just holding the two apart while they're fucking with it.

376
00:22:34,727 --> 00:22:37,817
Rym: Someone slips someone slipped and the screwdriver fell out dead.

377
00:22:38,098 --> 00:22:38,579
Rym: That was the end.

378
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:43,720
Rym: Yep, those people knew more about nuclear material than most people on earth do today.

379
00:22:43,901 --> 00:22:48,020
Rym: Then these were the experts of the world and they were fucking holding them with a screwdriver.

380
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:55,605
Scott: Why not make some sort of like mold that you put them in so that they're like a little wall, but you know Yeah, so it's gone.

381
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:57,534
Rym: So the way they have people actually work with this stuff.

382
00:22:57,554 --> 00:22:58,900
Rym: They do have controls like that.

383
00:22:59,281 --> 00:23:08,408
Rym: Someone just went and got all this shit and put it out on a table and said hey look And the story is all these safety lapses.

384
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:12,260
Rym: Los Alamos appears to be a shit show of nuclear safety today.

385
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,069
Scott: You think that's like the number one place?

386
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:14,572
Scott: Shouldn't it be?

387
00:23:14,592 --> 00:23:16,100
Rym: it probably is the number one place.

388
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,506
Scott: It'd be the least shit show.

389
00:23:17,526 --> 00:23:25,873
Rym: nuclear weapons are terrifying and the reality is that the u.s Actually critically under funds and under like trains the people who do this stuff.

390
00:23:26,254 --> 00:23:27,938
Rym: Mm-hmm, and you can.

391
00:23:28,078 --> 00:23:29,686
Rym: we're not news We're just commentary.

392
00:23:29,928 --> 00:23:30,713
Rym: you can read these.

393
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:32,886
Rym: if you're scared of this stuff Don't read these articles.

394
00:23:33,349 --> 00:23:35,180
Rym: if you're interested in it read these articles.

395
00:23:35,561 --> 00:23:41,566
Rym: But mostly I just want an excuse to talk about this picture because just loves talking about anything nucleated Holy shit, though this picture.

396
00:23:41,667 --> 00:23:44,579
Rym: like I I cannot get over this.

397
00:23:45,081 --> 00:23:46,645
Scott: Well, they're not screwdriver closed.

398
00:23:46,665 --> 00:23:48,109
Scott: They're like screwdrivers apart.

399
00:23:48,169 --> 00:23:49,914
Rym: So that nobody died.

400
00:23:50,135 --> 00:23:52,000
Rym: Nobody sneezed and bumped the table, I guess.

401
00:23:53,462 --> 00:24:00,675
Rym: And I guess the only other news we'll talk about before we get into the predicament Is that we try not to talk about politics too deeply on the show.

402
00:24:01,016 --> 00:24:11,390
Rym: I'm a politics now so the Republican Party in the US actually released the text of their health care bill and It is a monstrous like literal murder bill.

403
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:14,020
Rym: like it would literally ruin health care in America.

404
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:15,359
Rym: So I'm not gonna get into it.

405
00:24:15,801 --> 00:24:24,706
Rym: All I'm gonna say is that if you live in America and you live in a state that has even one Republican senator Call them and swear at like.

406
00:24:24,766 --> 00:24:27,719
Rym: call them and scream at them like call them and scare them.

407
00:24:28,522 --> 00:24:31,634
Rym: I like I live in a state where there's no one I can call.

408
00:24:31,774 --> 00:24:33,119
Rym: There's nothing I can do about this.

409
00:24:33,744 --> 00:24:36,422
Scott: My representatives are the best representatives like there's no.

410
00:24:36,442 --> 00:24:38,007
Scott: what like you couldn't if I get someone?

411
00:24:38,027 --> 00:24:43,945
Rym: my senators said that she like both my senators said that they will try to Grind the Senate to a halt to stop.

412
00:24:44,106 --> 00:24:54,320
Scott: I don't even have the kind of Democrats representing me that are like the centrist kind Like they're all the lefty guy and that like I'm like, oh run for no cuz I don't want to replace this person.

413
00:24:54,561 --> 00:24:55,023
Rym: I called my.

414
00:24:55,183 --> 00:24:56,188
Rym: I don't want to move.

415
00:24:56,368 --> 00:25:00,300
Rym: I called my state senator about a single pair and they were like, dude I fucking signed it.

416
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,142
Rym: I'm a sponsor.

417
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:06,297
Scott: my guy is like whenever there's a news like so-and-so in New York pushing for whatever.

418
00:25:06,357 --> 00:25:07,220
Scott: It's always my guy.

419
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,809
Scott: Well, I guess he's doing all.

420
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:12,500
Scott: I'm only bringing this up better at it than me.

421
00:25:12,762 --> 00:25:16,068
Rym: There's a lot of you out there Like we have a. really we have a decent number of fans.

422
00:25:16,489 --> 00:25:20,036
Rym: if you just happen to live in a state that has a Republican Center move.

423
00:25:20,762 --> 00:25:28,405
Rym: Well, yeah move but before you move call them like as I call them every once a day and swear at them Like I'm not even joking.

424
00:25:28,786 --> 00:25:33,060
Rym: You've got to make them scared that people in their state might actually do something.

425
00:25:34,143 --> 00:25:34,549
Rym: That's all.

426
00:25:34,671 --> 00:25:35,198
Scott: they don't give a shit.

427
00:25:36,522 --> 00:25:40,220
Scott: They might because the only thing they only share the rich people column.

428
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,805
Scott: No, they're scared.

429
00:25:41,825 --> 00:25:46,100
Rym: or if the people who actually vote get actually somehow angry which rarely happens.

430
00:25:47,762 --> 00:25:48,404
Rym: Thank you, man.

431
00:25:48,485 --> 00:25:49,027
Rym: I get mad.

432
00:25:49,489 --> 00:25:50,714
Scott: Don't get mad.

433
00:25:50,734 --> 00:25:52,020
Scott: No one's getting mad red circus.

434
00:25:57,025 --> 00:25:59,097
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

435
00:25:59,117 --> 00:26:11,587
Scott: what he got Right, so a long time ago I did a thing of the day where this guy goes to like the dollar store and buys like the most garbage like $1.00 kitchen knife.

436
00:26:11,808 --> 00:26:21,550
Scott: right but is an expert at knife sharpening Which means he actually knows how to use a whetstone which you know, I also sort of know the theory But I don't have the practice.

437
00:26:21,571 --> 00:26:22,033
Rym: I'm not good.

438
00:26:22,074 --> 00:26:23,080
Rym: I'm not even that good at home.

439
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:28,231
Scott: I've never actually done it right but I try to hone stuff and I'm not like I Feel like I should buy like $3.

440
00:26:28,231 --> 00:26:29,500
Scott: if I really wanted to get into it.

441
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:32,053
Scott: I should buy like three $1 knives and the stones.

442
00:26:32,134 --> 00:26:34,064
Scott: but it's like I already do enough shit But I just pay.

443
00:26:34,084 --> 00:26:35,713
Scott: so paying someone to sharpen knives.

444
00:26:35,754 --> 00:26:36,840
Scott: They charge like a few dollars.

445
00:26:37,021 --> 00:26:40,520
Scott: It's not worth it to do it yourself unless you're way into it or you do it a lot.

446
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,250
Scott: Anyway, but so that guy sharpened that $1 knife to.

447
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:44,113
Scott: it was crazy sharp.

448
00:26:44,134 --> 00:26:45,338
Scott: He was cutting paper and stuff.

449
00:26:45,358 --> 00:26:45,840
Scott: It was awesome.

450
00:26:45,941 --> 00:26:47,618
Scott: Right, he's back at it again.

451
00:26:48,385 --> 00:26:50,280
Rym: He back at it again in the Krispy Kreme.

452
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,449
Scott: He was in some kind of.

453
00:26:51,489 --> 00:26:52,820
Scott: he tells the story in the video.

454
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,270
Scott: But he was at some kind of store.

455
00:26:54,653 --> 00:27:02,331
Scott: and some poor guy Comes in trying to sell this old rusty knife to the store and the store was like no We're not even to give you like 30 cents for that.

456
00:27:03,116 --> 00:27:03,940
Scott: I guess it was in yen.

457
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,105
Scott: So convert whatever.

458
00:27:05,767 --> 00:27:08,337
Scott: but then he goes to the guy and he's like, oh, I'll buy that from you.

459
00:27:08,417 --> 00:27:10,788
Scott: and the guy's like Oh, really three dollars.

460
00:27:10,808 --> 00:27:15,139
Scott: Yeah, and he's like fine You know paid three dollars, right?

461
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:24,946
Scott: But this knife while it starts out all rusty is actually a hella nice fucking knife and he sharpens and shines that shit Like oh baby, this is so good.

462
00:27:24,966 --> 00:27:33,707
Scott: I just love seeing people restore a busted thing to Being awesome thing Again, it's just so.

463
00:27:33,747 --> 00:27:37,279
Scott: if only we could do that with like busted old subway.

464
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:38,663
Scott: Yeah Right.

465
00:27:38,704 --> 00:27:40,194
Scott: We should get this guy working on the subway.

466
00:27:40,415 --> 00:27:44,089
Scott: Yeah Take his whetstone onto the rails and clean.

467
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:46,517
Rym: So I got two things today, but they're deeply related.

468
00:27:47,139 --> 00:27:57,317
Rym: So You know in like old cartoons when Wile E. Coyote has like some dynamite that he's gonna blow up He has a big box with a tea stick on it and you push the tea down little plunger.

469
00:27:57,338 --> 00:28:01,382
Rym: Yep So this is big lives of YouTube channel I follow anybody.

470
00:28:01,483 --> 00:28:13,856
Rym: usually he takes dodgy Chinese electronics and takes it apart and explains exactly how it'll kill you but in this case he Explains in extreme detail how those old dynamite explode.

471
00:28:13,896 --> 00:28:14,759
Rym: his work is back then.

472
00:28:15,341 --> 00:28:24,595
Rym: Batteries did not have enough power if they even existed in a lot of places or enough reliability to be used for this And there wasn't like power like you couldn't plug in anything.

473
00:28:24,615 --> 00:28:25,600
Rym: This is like Wild West times.

474
00:28:26,322 --> 00:28:31,980
Rym: So he explains in extreme detail how those old dynamite blasters worked.

475
00:28:33,063 --> 00:28:37,765
Rym: And then in case you're wondering how they do it today It's not that different.

476
00:28:37,945 --> 00:28:43,408
Rym: and there's another video he has that shows a modern Abra dynamite Exploder and apparently in the industry.

477
00:28:43,508 --> 00:28:44,674
Rym: I didn't know a lot about these things.

478
00:28:45,216 --> 00:28:47,529
Rym: They're just called Dynamite exploders.

479
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:53,954
Rym: modern ones don't have plungers Nope They have cranks and buttons and they do not take power and they do not have batteries.

480
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:59,700
Rym: and they work almost the same way Just with more safety, I guess dynamite does not require power to explode.

481
00:29:00,142 --> 00:29:04,040
Rym: It requires very little the blasting caps, but essentially this is videos fascinating.

482
00:29:04,161 --> 00:29:16,200
Rym: the first one is okay because you learn how this old technology works, but this dynamite exploder is cool because it seems very retro and like very minimalist and simple and almost weirdly archaic.

483
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:24,220
Rym: and Yet this is how it's done today Because these old systems and these old methods are hyper reliable.

484
00:29:24,802 --> 00:29:26,168
Rym: They have no requirements.

485
00:29:26,188 --> 00:29:27,152
Rym: They don't need batteries.

486
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:28,377
Rym: They don't need power.

487
00:29:28,437 --> 00:29:29,160
Rym: They need dynamite.

488
00:29:29,671 --> 00:29:30,823
Rym: They yeah you need dynamite.

489
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:38,326
Rym: if you got dynamite you need the wires to connect to the dynamite and you got some wires and you got a Dynamite exploder and you got blasting caps.

490
00:29:38,567 --> 00:29:39,931
Rym: you can make dynamite explode.

491
00:29:40,131 --> 00:29:41,535
Scott: you need things.

492
00:29:41,716 --> 00:29:43,822
Rym: how this thing works is Fascinating.

493
00:29:44,063 --> 00:29:56,760
Rym: how durable this thing is is ridiculous and I had to look up what a thyristor has to be able to you know Not get destroyed if the dynamite it also has to work in a mine and mines are not the most comfortable places.

494
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,999
Scott: Yeah, the big rock falls on it.

495
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:02,000
Scott: It still needs to work and also not accidentally blow up all the dynamite if a rock falls on it.

496
00:30:02,201 --> 00:30:06,279
Rym: And also you'll learn what a thyristor is which I literally had to look up because I did not know.

497
00:30:08,241 --> 00:30:10,930
Rym: In the moment the booklet book is Frank Herbert's do I read a whole bunch.

498
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:11,973
Scott: I finished the.

499
00:30:12,374 --> 00:30:12,655
Scott: the first.

500
00:30:12,675 --> 00:30:16,708
Scott: we're reading Dune book one Yeah, which actually has like it has like.

501
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:24,474
Scott: each chapter isn't that long but there's like three sort of Parts, so it's like book one book two and book three are all in that first volume.

502
00:30:24,935 --> 00:30:26,500
Scott: So I finished the first one.

503
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:30,460
Rym: I mean, I'm doing the second one now I'm gonna read the whole thing because I'm going to London next week.

504
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,165
Rym: So I'm pretty much gonna read the whole thing on my trip.

505
00:30:32,767 --> 00:30:35,235
Scott: It's bait that board game is so accurate.

506
00:30:35,315 --> 00:30:37,020
Scott: Yeah, it's ridiculous.

507
00:30:37,985 --> 00:30:40,339
Scott: I didn't realize how accurate that board game was.

508
00:30:41,043 --> 00:30:43,719
Scott: They literally turned the book directly into that board game.

509
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:52,602
Rym: It's kind of amazing that you can have an IP in a game that so closely matches the source material in both theme and Substance.

510
00:30:52,762 --> 00:30:53,144
Scott: it's great.

511
00:30:53,204 --> 00:30:57,600
Scott: And like the the final thing that is in the game that wasn't in the book yet just happened.

512
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,055
Scott: It was a nexus in the book just now.

513
00:30:59,236 --> 00:31:03,964
Rym: No Also this weekend Emily will be there.

514
00:31:04,024 --> 00:31:05,290
Rym: a bunch of our friends will be there.

515
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:07,320
Rym: a bunch of our friends are speaking there.

516
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,063
Scott: I might go there.

517
00:31:08,103 --> 00:31:14,204
Rym: Joe foo, you might you know, uh, the visual novels like the people I work with outside Before.

518
00:31:14,224 --> 00:31:16,169
Rym: yeah, Joe foo is gonna be giving a talk.

519
00:31:16,209 --> 00:31:18,355
Rym: So is cat small who is fucking amazing.

520
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:19,197
Scott: She's running the thing.

521
00:31:19,237 --> 00:31:19,498
Rym: Yeah.

522
00:31:19,638 --> 00:31:25,454
Rym: Yeah and Game devs of color Expo is Saturday in New York City in Harlem.

523
00:31:25,875 --> 00:31:26,697
Rym: It's totally cheap.

524
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:27,941
Scott: It's $20.

525
00:31:27,941 --> 00:31:31,900
Scott: It's $20 a day of gaming talks like serious game.

526
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:33,969
Scott: Are you gonna get a bargain like that ever?

527
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:38,933
Rym: and if you're poor like you can't afford 20 bucks They'll help you out to like seriously.

528
00:31:38,974 --> 00:31:40,120
Rym: go to their website and check them out.

529
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,122
Scott: I'm sure you sure anyone who can listen to a podcast has $20.

530
00:31:44,122 --> 00:31:51,787
Rym: Yeah, but if you if you don't for whatever reason they pointedly have will help you get into this thing Mmm, and this is gonna be pretty cool.

531
00:31:52,189 --> 00:31:54,739
Rym: Also, it's coming up in a few weeks Kinetic.

532
00:31:54,840 --> 00:32:03,932
Rym: on ConnectiCon 15 is July 7 through 9. the website says 6 through 9 But on the 6th, all you can do is pick up your badges.

533
00:32:03,952 --> 00:32:05,720
Scott: We still run the panels department there.

534
00:32:05,821 --> 00:32:14,200
Rym: I guess I scheduled I guess Scott's in charge of like all our like day of logistics and operations in the panels department.

535
00:32:14,481 --> 00:32:16,069
Scott: It's we don't have a lot of staff this year.

536
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:18,260
Scott: So I'm just scheduling everyone for the whole con.

537
00:32:18,674 --> 00:32:26,976
Scott: Yeah I'm gonna let everyone punch in at the beginning and punch out at the end to Ease difficulty or worrying about shifts, but people just take breaks whenever.

538
00:32:27,217 --> 00:32:31,620
Rym: but seriously Like don't fly to Connecticut to go to Connecticut.

539
00:32:32,223 --> 00:32:41,438
Scott: But if you live within like a couple hour drive if you can drive today ConnectiCon or take some other kind of transportation to Hartford easily it is worth going to.

540
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:45,952
Scott: I don't know It's worth paying for it depends, but it's definitely worth going to.

541
00:32:46,012 --> 00:32:55,499
Scott: if you're a nerd who cares about anime Yeah, or gaming or any other kind of game doing its tabletop area is better than most tabletop cons like straight up.

542
00:32:56,302 --> 00:32:59,296
Rym: And it's that that departments run by people kind of like how we run panels.

543
00:32:59,357 --> 00:33:02,249
Scott: the same deal Even if you just want to have like one.

544
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:02,992
Scott: it's really good.

545
00:33:03,013 --> 00:33:23,633
Scott: if you just want like one day of nerdery Right, just go and you know, check out the guest list Maybe the someone your way into because basically where other cons will have like a few top-tier people's ConnectiCon you tends to get a ton of mid-tier people's right like people are on TV and people who write books like people you care about but like you might not know that you care about them.

546
00:33:23,674 --> 00:33:27,728
Scott: until you look at the list of guests you're Whoa, I actually sort of want to.

547
00:33:27,769 --> 00:33:29,557
Scott: oh man, wouldn't it be cool to see all these people?

548
00:33:29,617 --> 00:33:30,080
Scott: and that is.

549
00:33:31,101 --> 00:33:32,246
Rym: So we'll be doing some shows here.

550
00:33:32,266 --> 00:33:35,300
Rym: We're doing like four panels and I guess I'm hosting the opening ceremony.

551
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,430
Rym: We'll find out how that all goes.

552
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:39,306
Scott: I Did not volunteer for that.

553
00:33:39,386 --> 00:33:43,640
Scott: I was like, yeah, let's have uncle yo do it and otherwise subscribe to our stuff.

554
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:48,476
Rym: You know YouTube and all that and I think it's time for the predicament because I didn't have a good idea for show.

555
00:33:48,496 --> 00:33:50,363
Rym: I Got the demon coral.

556
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:51,870
Rym: Let me move that out of the way.

557
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:55,126
Rym: I Did too.

558
00:33:55,186 --> 00:33:56,736
Rym: they I think he might also do half of it.

559
00:33:56,797 --> 00:33:59,119
Rym: I'm not sure I haven't really looked into that so much.

560
00:33:59,561 --> 00:34:02,815
Rym: So, uh, I asked our patreon patrons because we talked.

561
00:34:03,156 --> 00:34:07,916
Rym: I think we streamed it But we didn't record it in the show about this like predicament that I guess people on reddit.

562
00:34:07,936 --> 00:34:08,639
Rym: We're talking about.

563
00:34:09,202 --> 00:34:12,614
Rym: Okay, and the idea was like so you're in outer Brooklyn.

564
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:13,295
Scott: No.

565
00:34:13,335 --> 00:34:14,340
Scott: No you live in Brooklyn.

566
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:19,487
Scott: Yeah, you're in Manhattan like at work or something or out on the street and you poop your pants.

567
00:34:20,069 --> 00:34:20,710
Scott: What do you do?

568
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:22,353
Scott: and People are bit.

569
00:34:22,373 --> 00:34:24,223
Scott: Well, it's like the answer was pretty much.

570
00:34:24,565 --> 00:34:25,530
Scott: Well, you pooped your pants.

571
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:28,005
Scott: It's not gonna be good right no matter what happened.

572
00:34:28,025 --> 00:34:28,489
Rym: What do you do?

573
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:29,192
Scott: What do you do?

574
00:34:29,212 --> 00:34:33,030
Scott: is you go buy new pants you go find a Starbucks bathroom, whatever you throw your pants?

575
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:38,909
Rym: Oh, so I have a very specific go commando whatever start with that one because this is you know, this is very similar to the like.

576
00:34:39,433 --> 00:34:41,245
Rym: How many five-year-olds could you fight off?

577
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:42,030
Rym: kind of question?

578
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:44,558
Rym: But the difference is these are more.

579
00:34:44,598 --> 00:34:46,889
Rym: at least this was more like a very specific practical thing.

580
00:34:47,291 --> 00:34:50,870
Rym: So I thought so I thought very specifically what I would do just in case you know good happen.

581
00:34:52,234 --> 00:34:56,889
Rym: What I would first do is go to the nearest Starbucks and assess the damage in that bathroom.

582
00:34:57,577 --> 00:34:58,083
Rym: I just get right.

583
00:34:58,103 --> 00:35:05,480
Rym: in that bathroom I would sacrifice my underwear because I'm assuming they're a lost cause Mm-hmm, and I would clean myself up as best I could.

584
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:13,170
Rym: I would actually wash the inside of the pants in the sink as best I could and then I would go out to the nearest clothing store of any kind.

585
00:35:13,971 --> 00:35:17,490
Rym: Buy pants buy underwear because you can buy underwear like every drugstore.

586
00:35:18,072 --> 00:35:23,167
Rym: Go back to a different Starbucks because by then people might remember I was the guy who left a bunch of.

587
00:35:23,528 --> 00:35:24,786
Rym: left a poop smell in the sink.

588
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:31,670
Rym: Wash myself again change everything throw the old pants away, and then I would take the subway home.

589
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:35,030
Scott: Just go home and then you know and never speak of it again.

590
00:35:36,673 --> 00:35:37,215
Scott: Set your life.

591
00:35:37,777 --> 00:36:01,968
Rym: I did have a situation in Australia where I Didn't poop my pants But I almost did cuz I ate some Mexican food in Manly and that Mexican food fucked me up real bad, and I was on a long hike in the woods so I pooped I cleaned up with the boxers I Buried them, and I never spoke of it again.

592
00:36:02,873 --> 00:36:04,219
Rym: And that is what I did at manly.

593
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:08,745
Rym: so if you ever dig a hole somewhere in the woods in manly You might find my poopy boxers one time.

594
00:36:08,785 --> 00:36:13,550
Scott: I was biking Down in like by the Obobo bridge.

595
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:16,143
Scott: Yes, I mean it was down there.

596
00:36:16,163 --> 00:36:26,377
Scott: right I was in a woods but and I had to poop real bad, so I went into the woods a bit and I squatted and I pooped and Just after I got a

597
00:36:26,437 --> 00:36:27,803
Rym: hope for the clean delivery

598
00:36:27,883 --> 00:36:33,941
Scott: just after I finished pooping And I started to walk away some people were approaching and I ran.

599
00:36:33,961 --> 00:36:39,278
Scott: yeah, but I'm pretty sure they saw that poop Because it was.

600
00:36:39,298 --> 00:36:43,259
Scott: it was like it was like a pile But this is not the poop emoji.

601
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,650
Rym: so 11 patrons gave us predicaments.

602
00:36:46,753 --> 00:36:48,529
Rym: I skimmed him But I did not read them in detail.

603
00:36:48,992 --> 00:36:52,067
Rym: We'll blow through as many of these as we feel like and we'll see how this goes.

604
00:36:52,349 --> 00:36:54,458
Rym: yeah I don't know how realistic these are.

605
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:57,613
Rym: I only read one just to kind of make sure they were Plausible.

606
00:36:57,633 --> 00:36:59,242
Rym: there was a pretty good one about a ride at a hot.

607
00:36:59,262 --> 00:37:03,162
Rym: you didn't scream this content But if they're bad, we'll read them out loud and shame the person.

608
00:37:03,283 --> 00:37:04,730
Scott: well you can edit the show to move.

609
00:37:04,991 --> 00:37:05,996
Rym: I'm not editing that.

610
00:37:06,578 --> 00:37:07,302
Rym: so the first one.

611
00:37:07,322 --> 00:37:08,105
Rym: I'll just go in order.

612
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:10,295
Rym: uh Is unattributed?

613
00:37:10,797 --> 00:37:11,319
Rym: I'll just read it.

614
00:37:11,881 --> 00:37:13,969
Rym: the both of you are trying to find a place to eat at PAX.

615
00:37:14,811 --> 00:37:16,335
Rym: Okay, not determine the location.

616
00:37:16,716 --> 00:37:21,370
Rym: you split off from your normal party, and you go down a street with a very distinct fog.

617
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:30,450
Rym: Alright, okay, as you emerge on the other side of the fog you hear a faint Foghorn and you look around only to notice that all the traffic is no longer on the road.

618
00:37:31,133 --> 00:37:34,030
Rym: Your cell phones GPS doesn't find our location and every building is boarded.

619
00:37:34,191 --> 00:37:37,089
Rym: Okay, so obviously we're in Silent Hill now, okay?

620
00:37:37,691 --> 00:37:41,969
Rym: Looking back the way you came you see a cliff face with signs the state not to climb down.

621
00:37:42,952 --> 00:37:43,919
Rym: So I guess there's a cliff there.

622
00:37:43,939 --> 00:37:48,882
Rym: ahead of you is more fog But you can vaguely catch the outline of a person like objects.

623
00:37:49,244 --> 00:37:50,890
Rym: well to your side you see two alleyways.

624
00:37:51,171 --> 00:37:53,481
Rym: You're unable to determine where they ultimately end.

625
00:37:53,501 --> 00:37:55,430
Rym: How do you get out of this situation?

626
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:59,745
Scott: I mean if I'm trapped in some haunted fantasy world it's gonna be pretty dangerous.

627
00:37:59,786 --> 00:38:00,850
Scott: I'm probably gonna die anyway.

628
00:38:01,252 --> 00:38:01,794
Rym: There's all.

629
00:38:01,814 --> 00:38:05,189
Scott: I don't believe in that bullshit, so I just go to the person and be like yo where we at.

630
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:06,194
Rym: no No, see you back up.

631
00:38:06,496 --> 00:38:07,018
Rym: There's there's.

632
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,170
Rym: there's a very small list of potential situation.

633
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:14,290
Scott: I could also be hallucinating which is even more likely so I should just sit down and take a nap in order.

634
00:38:14,411 --> 00:38:15,998
Rym: I think here's the most likely scenarios.

635
00:38:16,139 --> 00:38:16,963
Rym: It's number one.

636
00:38:16,983 --> 00:38:19,552
Rym: I am dreaming Also good.

637
00:38:19,572 --> 00:38:24,930
Rym: Yeah, so my first goal just to figure out if I am dreaming or not jump down the cliff.

638
00:38:25,071 --> 00:38:26,400
Rym: No, don't jump down the cliff because what is?

639
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,044
Scott: you're not dreaming?

640
00:38:27,326 --> 00:38:27,910
Scott: pinch yourself.

641
00:38:28,212 --> 00:38:31,090
Rym: So I actually I just hope because I like the lucid dream.

642
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:33,258
Rym: I actually have a very specific process in my life.

643
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:44,269
Rym: if I ever end up in a situation that seems strange I look at my hands, and that's a trigger And then I just think can I trace back all the steps that led me to where I am now?

644
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:47,923
Rym: Because if I can't it's almost definitely a dream because dreams.

645
00:38:47,943 --> 00:38:59,947
Rym: you're like in your grandma's house But there's a weird door and now you're in New York, and then you're flying like it doesn't make sense But in real life stuff makes sense if I can't determine that I'm dreaming like if it all makes sense.

646
00:39:00,168 --> 00:39:02,390
Rym: number two I am hallucinating.

647
00:39:03,172 --> 00:39:10,670
Rym: In which case try to do as little as possible because I don't know what my meat body is doing out in the non hallucinating world.

648
00:39:10,791 --> 00:39:13,530
Scott: Yeah, sit down to where I sit down and wait.

649
00:39:14,712 --> 00:39:20,921
Rym: If Scott's next to me, I ask him if he's seeing the same shit as I am Because maybe he said you're all alone now you got separate.

650
00:39:21,001 --> 00:39:24,677
Rym: Oh, yeah, if we get completely separated Yeah, but if like Scott and I are together.

651
00:39:25,139 --> 00:39:26,926
Rym: I'm like Scott am I hallucinating?

652
00:39:26,946 --> 00:39:28,050
Rym: Are you hallucinating?

653
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:32,190
Rym: Did someone spike our water at the panel and we're both on LSD?

654
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:34,996
Rym: Scenario number three next most likely.

655
00:39:35,016 --> 00:39:39,590
Rym: This is a crazy elaborate prank like Japanese game show style.

656
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:44,750
Rym: And fourth most likely magic is real, and this is magic nonsense.

657
00:39:45,732 --> 00:39:49,650
Rym: So all I try to do is eliminate options one two and three as quickly as possible.

658
00:39:50,092 --> 00:39:52,224
Rym: Because of magic's on the table then all bets are off.

659
00:39:52,425 --> 00:39:53,290
Scott: start casting spells.

660
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:54,171
Rym: Yep I am.

661
00:39:54,493 --> 00:39:55,716
Rym: that is Scott Johnson's go-to.

662
00:39:56,078 --> 00:40:05,823
Rym: if you ever find a legit vampire or a real ghost you immediately Read like every magic spell you've ever heard of in your entire life Go to the borders and get yourself an economic on staff.

663
00:40:06,204 --> 00:40:07,390
Rym: You just start wearing amulets.

664
00:40:07,751 --> 00:40:10,722
Rym: You start looking for more vampires like spice of garlic.

665
00:40:10,802 --> 00:40:12,810
Rym: All you got to find is one and it's game on.

666
00:40:13,532 --> 00:40:15,138
Rym: So yeah, that's that's it after that.

667
00:40:15,198 --> 00:40:15,499
Rym: It's all.

668
00:40:15,539 --> 00:40:16,582
Rym: just choose your own adventure.

669
00:40:16,763 --> 00:40:17,907
Scott: Yeah, that was lame next.

670
00:40:17,967 --> 00:40:18,088
Scott: Okay.

671
00:40:18,108 --> 00:40:19,714
Rym: Thanks Alright, let's see.

672
00:40:19,774 --> 00:40:20,597
Rym: How do I get to the next?

673
00:40:20,617 --> 00:40:23,930
Scott: this is not my idea, but we don't have any other ideas for Thursday.

674
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:27,522
Scott: So you have no choice, but alright fall on this backup plan.

675
00:40:27,562 --> 00:40:29,830
Rym: So a Canadian appropriate to this one.

676
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:31,083
Rym: This is the hockey that I skinned.

677
00:40:31,224 --> 00:40:33,956
Scott: a Canadian Like a heavy time Canadian.

678
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:37,968
Scott: a Canadian person a Canadian person not a Canadian person from Canada.

679
00:40:38,049 --> 00:40:44,370
Rym: Yep Game seven of the NHL Eastern Finals Rangers versus a new at New Jersey.

680
00:40:44,471 --> 00:40:53,007
Rym: Okay triple overtime Victory for the Rangers on a clearly blown call by the refs that does not get overturned.

681
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:53,749
Scott: Oh, we'll take it.

682
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:56,173
Scott: I think we can get but I'll admit this bullshit.

683
00:40:56,333 --> 00:41:06,510
Rym: our riot ensues throughout the arena a parking lot and City, all right, you both arrived in full Rangers attire by car.

684
00:41:07,234 --> 00:41:12,677
Rym: You have a hundred and fifty dollars cash total Mm-hmm and your individual credit cards.

685
00:41:13,118 --> 00:41:17,930
Rym: the bridge of a given starts in the front row behind the devil goaltender crap.

686
00:41:17,991 --> 00:41:25,067
Rym: So we're like we're surrounded Surrounded by a gang of irrational angry drunk David putty like devil's fans and body pain.

687
00:41:25,408 --> 00:41:26,110
Rym: Please get home.

688
00:41:26,331 --> 00:41:27,857
Scott: They're not actually gonna mess with us.

689
00:41:27,897 --> 00:41:28,640
Scott: We'll just go home.

690
00:41:29,101 --> 00:41:31,290
Scott: So we walk to the car and drive away slowly.

691
00:41:32,812 --> 00:41:33,956
Rym: It's a legit riot.

692
00:41:34,177 --> 00:41:39,015
Rym: So like cars are being flipped over in the parking lot and in the entire city There's fight like the stands.

693
00:41:39,035 --> 00:41:40,200
Rym: they're fighting and angry.

694
00:41:40,341 --> 00:41:42,610
Scott: the train will take us home and we wouldn't even drive there.

695
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:43,681
Scott: We would definitely take the train.

696
00:41:43,782 --> 00:41:44,570
Rym: So the crowd's angry.

697
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:47,489
Rym: What if they like attack us like people are attacking each other fights everywhere?

698
00:41:48,671 --> 00:41:50,421
Rym: Run, okay, so we run we fight.

699
00:41:50,702 --> 00:41:52,893
Rym: I guess forget on the train I guess by.

700
00:41:52,913 --> 00:41:54,881
Rym: you know, you know now that I think about this.

701
00:41:54,941 --> 00:41:57,230
Scott: riots aren't like as inescapable as you think.

702
00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:02,774
Scott: It's like I've been at sporting events where they're like big brawls and stuff and it's like yeah You're just not.

703
00:42:02,794 --> 00:42:03,035
Scott: if you're.

704
00:42:03,076 --> 00:42:04,967
Rym: no, you know, make yourself a part of it.

705
00:42:04,987 --> 00:42:05,550
Scott: You're not part of this.

706
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:06,675
Scott: Families at this game.

707
00:42:06,695 --> 00:42:10,010
Scott: Well, you're older in right a city gonna be just fine - you just escape.

708
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:11,234
Rym: Well people like I mean I would.

709
00:42:11,274 --> 00:42:16,715
Rym: so I was in a riot in a crowded hockey game and I almost got hit a couple Times you can get.

710
00:42:16,835 --> 00:42:24,310
Scott: you can get hit like by you know, a stray bullet like, you know If there's some shooting that's unrelated to you, but I got hit like fists were coming and flying like they're right here.

711
00:42:24,552 --> 00:42:26,347
Scott: You just get away from the hot zone.

712
00:42:27,431 --> 00:42:31,710
Rym: So, yeah, so I think the city and the parking lot literally don't matter.

713
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:34,119
Rym: I actually I came up with a really good idea.

714
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:35,786
Rym: So one let's assume these drum thing.

715
00:42:35,846 --> 00:42:36,890
Scott: You need a really good idea.

716
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:38,297
Scott: I don't think it's a bad situation.

717
00:42:38,398 --> 00:42:38,981
Scott: So what?

718
00:42:39,001 --> 00:42:39,744
Rym: so these these?

719
00:42:40,106 --> 00:42:46,110
Rym: these quote irrational Surrounded by an irrational angry drunk David putty like devil's fans and body paint.

720
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:49,008
Rym: So there there are legit angry dudes who are trying to punch us.

721
00:42:50,194 --> 00:42:51,490
Rym: So I guess we punch it back and run.

722
00:42:51,570 --> 00:43:03,110
Rym: but all I would do is I would run and try to get into like the hallways and You know all those hallways like at any arena that you're not supposed to go into that there's usually like a person.

723
00:43:03,592 --> 00:43:08,190
Scott: Yeah, I mean you could definitely be using emergency exits to get out, you know, I wouldn't try to get out.

724
00:43:08,311 --> 00:43:18,837
Rym: I would try to get into all the hallways that like staff use Because the way those are not usually like blocked or locked like you can usually get into them But there's arena staff who will let you in.

725
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:25,948
Rym: if the arena staff are there and are in such control that they still won't let Me in I am safest by being right next to them.

726
00:43:26,454 --> 00:43:26,990
Rym: That's all right.

727
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:29,137
Scott: There's also plenty of security at these things.

728
00:43:29,338 --> 00:43:35,339
Rym: if the security is overwhelmed and they can't stop me from getting into those back hallways It's really really ridiculous.

729
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:37,750
Rym: I just run it is not it and I just wait.

730
00:43:38,051 --> 00:43:42,250
Scott: There could not be that such a riot could not and you're it just couldn't be this.

731
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:42,854
Rym: I think it could.

732
00:43:42,874 --> 00:43:45,129
Scott: this is even more ridiculous than the hallucinating.

733
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:49,990
Rym: A lot of people got like surrounded and attacked during like riots in LA and they couldn't get away.

734
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:50,613
Rym: Like what do you do?

735
00:43:51,055 --> 00:43:52,342
Scott: That was a different kind of riot.

736
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:53,186
Rym: This road is this.

737
00:43:53,227 --> 00:43:53,830
Rym: rides like that.

738
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:55,237
Rym: It's like legit off the hook.

739
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:56,503
Rym: be what it sounds like.

740
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,608
Rym: it is triple overtime.

741
00:43:57,628 --> 00:44:00,822
Scott: in New Jersey Hockey arena is half full of businessmen and children.

742
00:44:01,384 --> 00:44:02,429
Rym: Well, what if they're all crazy?

743
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:05,957
Rym: Stadium, all right.

744
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:08,570
Rym: What if same scenario but it was soccer.

745
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:12,770
Scott: I don't go there because that kind of thing can happen there if I won't do a soccer game like that.

746
00:44:13,811 --> 00:44:18,590
Rym: If soccer if hockey fans were like soccer hooligans, I would not wear a Rangers jersey at that game.

747
00:44:19,273 --> 00:44:21,602
Rym: I would actually wear a New Jersey Jersey to blend in.

748
00:44:21,782 --> 00:44:26,418
Scott: I would not go to a place That was the soccer stadium where that sort of thing could happen.

749
00:44:26,779 --> 00:44:30,170
Rym: All right, let's see you're at a dinner party dinner and boardgame party.

750
00:44:30,491 --> 00:44:32,099
Rym: This is from the terrible secret of space.

751
00:44:32,119 --> 00:44:36,737
Rym: Mm-hmm hosted by a couple with whom you are friends Mm-hmm, and they begin to argue during the board game.

752
00:44:37,179 --> 00:44:39,647
Rym: The argument grows in intensity becoming louder and meaner.

753
00:44:39,667 --> 00:44:45,290
Rym: awkward Yep, with both of them escalating to the point of trying to provoke other people into joining the argument on their side.

754
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:47,909
Rym: So so far just to stop the person who submitted this.

755
00:44:48,773 --> 00:44:54,405
Rym: that happens on a like Regular basis in our own friend group every time like all the time.

756
00:44:54,445 --> 00:44:55,408
Scott: Like you're allowed to argue.

757
00:44:55,428 --> 00:44:55,890
Scott: What's the pattern?

758
00:44:56,291 --> 00:44:59,547
Rym: We literally try to provoke each other into joining sides in these arguments.

759
00:44:59,567 --> 00:45:00,190
Scott: What's the problem?

760
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:03,440
Rym: How do you extradite yourself extricate yourself from the situation?

761
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:03,741
Rym: You don't?

762
00:45:03,762 --> 00:45:05,347
Scott: you just are social fallout as possible.

763
00:45:05,387 --> 00:45:06,873
Rym: No, I just argue Just argue.

764
00:45:06,893 --> 00:45:07,516
Rym: What's the problem?

765
00:45:07,596 --> 00:45:10,850
Rym: You take the opportunity to win the game while the other players are distracted and unfolding.

766
00:45:10,951 --> 00:45:12,181
Scott: Of course, I complain.

767
00:45:12,241 --> 00:45:12,564
Scott: Come on.

768
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:13,270
Scott: Let's take your turn.

769
00:45:13,471 --> 00:45:17,533
Scott: I'm not one to stop arguing but take your goddamn Turns.

770
00:45:17,714 --> 00:45:18,337
Rym: I was Christ.

771
00:45:18,377 --> 00:45:19,343
Scott: take your goddamn turn.

772
00:45:19,443 --> 00:45:23,990
Rym: if they keep taking their turns Then the arguments not that bad and I'm gonna use their distraction to win the game.

773
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:27,749
Rym: Duh, if their argument stops the game, I argue with them.

774
00:45:28,651 --> 00:45:30,337
Rym: Yeah, I don't even try to get out.

775
00:45:30,457 --> 00:45:33,228
Rym: I this is literally my regular gaming experience.

776
00:45:33,248 --> 00:45:33,850
Scott: What's wrong with that?

777
00:45:34,191 --> 00:45:34,773
Scott: I don't see.

778
00:45:34,793 --> 00:45:35,878
Scott: how is this even a predicament?

779
00:45:35,938 --> 00:45:36,841
Scott: This is just every day.

780
00:45:37,122 --> 00:45:39,010
Rym: How would you solve the Brewster's millions problem?

781
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:41,122
Scott: What's the Brewster's millions from you don't know the Bruce's.

782
00:45:41,142 --> 00:45:42,310
Scott: I've heard of Brewster's millions.

783
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:43,737
Scott: Isn't it like a TV show or something?

784
00:45:43,978 --> 00:45:44,239
Rym: Okay.

785
00:45:44,259 --> 00:45:51,290
Rym: So the idea is you're given a Ridiculous amount of money in a bank account cash you use for anything each time.

786
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,800
Rym: I'm not gonna read this whole thing, but I can.

787
00:45:52,901 --> 00:45:54,109
Rym: I can summarize it pretty succinctly.

788
00:45:54,270 --> 00:46:02,779
Rym: Okay, you must within 30 days from the moment you got this crazy amount of money Like let's say 300 million dollars Mm-hmm.

789
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:13,489
Rym: If you liquid spend all of it and by the end of 30 days have nothing left But things you own before you got the third 300 million you get 3 billion.

790
00:46:14,632 --> 00:46:18,570
Scott: Wait, I have to spend all the 300 and you can't give it to charity.

791
00:46:18,851 --> 00:46:22,672
Rym: You can't gamble it because because you can't make stupid gambling I can't.

792
00:46:22,953 --> 00:46:25,686
Scott: I can't just invest it you because then you're making more money.

793
00:46:25,927 --> 00:46:33,849
Rym: you have to get Reasonable and appropriate value for the spending of the money and have none left and nothing left by the end of 30 days.

794
00:46:33,849 --> 00:46:40,422
Rym: 30 million, let's say 300 million 300 million giant amount of money.

795
00:46:40,442 --> 00:46:40,964
Scott: So I have to have.

796
00:46:40,984 --> 00:46:43,253
Scott: I have to spend it all You.

797
00:46:43,413 --> 00:46:44,055
Rym: you can't just give it.

798
00:46:44,075 --> 00:46:48,250
Rym: you have to get some reasonable value for your spending like you can throw a giant party.

799
00:46:48,551 --> 00:46:49,314
Rym: That's totally cool.

800
00:46:49,535 --> 00:46:50,459
Rym: You can't just burn it.

801
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:52,929
Rym: You can't just like buy Faberge eggs and eat them.

802
00:46:53,431 --> 00:46:54,796
Scott: Couldn't I just buy like a sports team?

803
00:46:54,816 --> 00:46:56,623
Rym: I guess that's making money.

804
00:46:56,643 --> 00:47:01,734
Rym: You'd have to make that sports team suck Like The sports team is an asset.

805
00:47:01,915 --> 00:47:04,324
Rym: You'd have to destroy the value of the asset within 30 days.

806
00:47:04,344 --> 00:47:06,371
Scott: Oh I had.

807
00:47:06,411 --> 00:47:10,690
Scott: so I have to but then I would get 3 billion and then I could just buy like multiple sports.

808
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:14,930
Rym: Yeah, the goal is you spend it all and then you are one of the wealthiest people in the world forever.

809
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:18,080
Scott: I'd buy a Boat and sink it.

810
00:47:18,664 --> 00:47:19,390
Rym: No, it's specific.

811
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:19,591
Rym: There's.

812
00:47:19,611 --> 00:47:22,019
Rym: so there's a specific rule in the Bruce's millions thing.

813
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:26,572
Rym: You cannot buy luxury goods just to destroy them Specifically.

814
00:47:26,592 --> 00:47:29,070
Scott: so basically this is a really stupid question.

815
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:31,910
Scott: It's like oh tell me how do you solve this problem?

816
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:37,775
Scott: And then we're gonna make a special exception for every possible answer like like what's one plus one But you can't say two.

817
00:47:37,835 --> 00:47:39,220
Scott: who is not an allowable answer to me?

818
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:40,424
Scott: another answer besides what.

819
00:47:40,504 --> 00:47:44,789
Scott: I actually have a really trivial way to Do this get to get it all in cash and burn it.

820
00:47:45,475 --> 00:47:52,750
Rym: I would just found a Bunch of game companies to make the kinds of games that I want with ridiculous budgets and give the games away for free.

821
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:55,497
Scott: But you still own these game companies.

822
00:47:55,517 --> 00:47:58,730
Rym: the game companies are worth bupkis because they don't have any revenue stream.

823
00:48:00,093 --> 00:48:00,557
Scott: Oh, I got it.

824
00:48:00,879 --> 00:48:01,262
Scott: I got it.

825
00:48:01,584 --> 00:48:12,150
Scott: I would hire an employee To work for me and pay them to be your personal and I would pay them $300,000,000 for like one hour of being my personal servant.

826
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:15,339
Rym: Okay, even if they need value, right say you have to get reasonable value.

827
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:22,119
Rym: hire a giant team of butlers to cater your personal living Experience to a ridiculous ultra stupid degree.

828
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:27,757
Scott: I would hire an army of people for whatever amount of time Minimum wage to March somewhere.

829
00:48:27,837 --> 00:48:29,021
Rym: do the Lewis black ball washer.

830
00:48:29,422 --> 00:48:30,626
Scott: Yeah, something whatever.

831
00:48:30,706 --> 00:48:32,030
Rym: That's what I do Lewis black ball washer.

832
00:48:33,716 --> 00:48:41,358
Scott: I'd have the Lewis black ball washer Equivalent of a bunch of game studios and hire people to do whatever for a amount of time and then all the money's gone And all the people are fired the end.

833
00:48:41,378 --> 00:48:43,410
Rym: I'd also hire people remember that movie the game.

834
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:47,310
Scott: I hire some of them to clean my apartment - I do that.

835
00:48:47,652 --> 00:48:50,770
Rym: I would hire people to run the game for me from that movie the game.

836
00:48:52,692 --> 00:48:54,379
Rym: All right, whatever they're actually killing time.

837
00:48:54,399 --> 00:48:55,383
Rym: I don't think we'll get through all of them.

838
00:48:55,664 --> 00:48:57,030
Scott: It's also really stupid question.

839
00:48:57,172 --> 00:48:57,743
Rym: I think it's fine.

840
00:48:57,804 --> 00:49:06,570
Rym: ever accused Invisible people have invaded the city and they explode on contact with non invisible people and they want to do this.

841
00:49:07,092 --> 00:49:11,130
Rym: You and only you can see them and they only respond with laughter.

842
00:49:12,331 --> 00:49:13,415
Rym: What will you do?

843
00:49:13,496 --> 00:49:16,790
Rym: so I can see them and if they touch a person they explode including me.

844
00:49:17,411 --> 00:49:20,402
Rym: Yeah, I get the fuck out of the city because that's dangerous.

845
00:49:20,422 --> 00:49:22,430
Rym: There's no way to solve that and I wait for it to die down.

846
00:49:22,832 --> 00:49:23,495
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

847
00:49:23,535 --> 00:49:24,239
Rym: That's all I would do.

848
00:49:24,259 --> 00:49:24,661
Rym: There's nothing.

849
00:49:24,701 --> 00:49:26,450
Scott: I could get any explosions all over the place.

850
00:49:26,571 --> 00:49:28,700
Scott: Yeah, they're gonna be grabbing everyone exploding everyone.

851
00:49:29,022 --> 00:49:30,830
Scott: just cuz I can see them coming just like that.

852
00:49:31,011 --> 00:49:34,950
Scott: It just means I have a better chance of running away and properly like those golden compass monsters.

853
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:35,615
Rym: You're just.

854
00:49:35,675 --> 00:49:36,602
Scott: everyone else is just fuck.

855
00:49:36,643 --> 00:49:37,630
Scott: but at least I can get away.

856
00:49:37,871 --> 00:49:41,370
Scott: I mean I use the internet while I was running on my phone to warn people of well danger.

857
00:49:41,451 --> 00:49:42,823
Rym: I mean I'd warn my friends.

858
00:49:42,844 --> 00:49:43,891
Rym: we get the fuck out I'm sure.

859
00:49:44,011 --> 00:49:53,260
Scott: as I was running I could do various things to help other people like throw sacks of flour around or You know stuff like that.

860
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,507
Rym: Oh, yeah, I think his flowers.

861
00:49:54,527 --> 00:49:59,510
Scott: a good idea But you know in general just run until I'm away from this craziness cuz you can't win.

862
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:04,910
Scott: I would save myself and I just if I get far enough away the density of these invisible people is lowered.

863
00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:07,520
Scott: I could just get guns cuz that's invaded and I have no problem.

864
00:50:07,581 --> 00:50:11,389
Scott: if there were invisible people who explode and kill you when they Touch you I have no problem shooting them.

865
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:19,701
Scott: so yeah, as soon as I get far enough away from the city to gun land, I would get some gun and Slowly make my way back sort of like a zombie situation.

866
00:50:19,761 --> 00:50:20,926
Rym: It says invaded the city.

867
00:50:20,966 --> 00:50:21,770
Rym: So they invade New York.

868
00:50:22,111 --> 00:50:23,798
Rym: I let the invisible people have New York.

869
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:25,405
Rym: I go live in some other city.

870
00:50:25,425 --> 00:50:26,670
Rym: That's that's the best.

871
00:50:26,952 --> 00:50:29,830
Scott: I'm sure the government would come and clean them out after and then I could come back.

872
00:50:29,951 --> 00:50:32,314
Rym: Yeah, but if they invade the rest of the country What was I gonna do about it?

873
00:50:32,514 --> 00:50:35,485
Scott: go to somewhere across water because there's still people.

874
00:50:35,585 --> 00:50:37,050
Rym: they they only respond with laughter.

875
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:39,199
Rym: So I can't like make myself their leader or anything.

876
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:40,504
Scott: It's a really stupid question.

877
00:50:40,544 --> 00:50:40,765
Scott: Again.

878
00:50:40,825 --> 00:50:42,916
Rym: Anyway, I think it was fine Plus you got really into it.

879
00:50:43,378 --> 00:50:44,042
Rym: All right, let's see.

880
00:50:44,163 --> 00:50:44,525

883
00:50:56,097 --> 00:51:04,923
Rym: Okay But the couple you're living with forces you to do household chores dishes for meals laundry Vehicles weeding panics by hand in crazy temperatures.

884

Rym: They don't let you use the car.

885
00:51:06,247 --> 00:51:07,170
Rym: They basically make you a slave.

886
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:10,164
Scott: Okay, but I still get to leave after the two weeks though, right?

891
00:51:21,854 --> 00:51:22,858
Scott: They know go fuck yourself.

892
00:51:23,059 --> 00:51:27,468

00:51:43,643 --> 00:51:48,714
Rym: if you piss the farmers off They discredit your two weeks meaning you have to do it again somewhere else I do it somewhere else.

903
00:51:49,156 --> 00:51:55,547
Rym: if if society exists such that I could not get out of this situation I would turn to organize my violence.

904
00:51:55,588 --> 00:52:06,323
Scott: to end I just want to point out right look how many not only on the millions one but on this one and all the other ones Right how many exceptions people have to make to make a situation truly a predicament.

905
00:52:06,363 --> 00:52:11,985
Scott: that shows you just how safe Modern real society is.

906
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:14,955
Rym: look at ever almost So difficult.

907
00:52:15,015 --> 00:52:18,210
Rym: every predicament movie has to make cell phones not work.

908
00:52:18,370 --> 00:52:19,153
Scott: They're like not.

909
00:52:19,194 --> 00:52:25,457
Scott: my cell phones are the biggest most powerful tool that everyone's carrying right like the ultimate weaponry But there's like even without cell phones.

910
00:52:25,518 --> 00:52:29,090
Scott: It's like there are just so many ways to get out of a bad situation.

911
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:34,686
Scott: It's like it's really hard for bad things of any large magnitude to happen, right?

912
00:52:35,308 --> 00:52:44,566
Scott: It's like It's not really reasons to worry about much because like people have to come up with such ridiculous Nonsense scenarios for there to be any sense of danger whatsoever.

913
00:52:44,747 --> 00:52:48,022
Rym: I'm looking for one That's like really short because we've done basically a whole show.

914
00:52:48,042 --> 00:52:49,790
Scott: That's why Godzilla is a thing, right?

915
00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:54,606
Scott: You need some ridiculous thing like giant radioactive monsters stomps and breathes fire on everything.

916
00:52:54,866 --> 00:52:55,930
Scott: That's the level of danger.

917
00:52:56,371 --> 00:52:58,136
Rym: Here's a short one from Ren from New Zealand.

918
00:52:58,518 --> 00:53:02,229
Rym: really simple and there's no exceptions at all home invasion at night.

919
00:53:02,249 --> 00:53:04,749
Rym: You're in your bed So, uh, you're in your bedroom.

920
00:53:05,271 --> 00:53:11,067
Rym: Mm-hmm the door busts open at night someone comes in and they have a melee weapon to the bedroom.

921
00:53:11,267 --> 00:53:11,468
Rym: Yeah.

922
00:53:11,708 --> 00:53:12,330
Scott: All right bedroom.

923
00:53:12,391 --> 00:53:13,439
Rym: They have a knife or a bat.

924
00:53:13,459 --> 00:53:14,669
Rym: you can't quite tell cuz it's dark.

925
00:53:14,851 --> 00:53:16,440
Scott: Are they gonna hurt me or they just want to rob me?

926
00:53:16,963 --> 00:53:18,130
Rym: Uh, it's home invasion.

927
00:53:18,251 --> 00:53:21,044
Rym: So you don't know what their intentions are, but they're yelling cuz I'm.

928
00:53:21,164 --> 00:53:22,350
Rym: it's really simply what are they?

929
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:23,112
Scott: What are they yelling?

930
00:53:23,394 --> 00:53:24,960
Rym: We don't know it would you don't know?

931
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:27,590
Rym: Okay, so let's just assume they're yelling and it's unintelligible.

932
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:29,754
Scott: Whoa, bro, chill out.

933
00:53:29,774 --> 00:53:30,276
Scott: Chill out, bro.

934
00:53:30,497 --> 00:53:31,340
Scott: Whoa, what's the problem?

935
00:53:31,621 --> 00:53:32,826
Rym: I think I'm gonna rob me.

936
00:53:32,846 --> 00:53:33,208
Scott: Go ahead.

937
00:53:33,248 --> 00:53:34,660
Scott: Go rob me Just don't stab me.

938
00:53:34,863 --> 00:53:35,450
Scott: What's the problem?

939
00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:48,010
Rym: I feel like honestly in that situation if I'm in my bedroom and someone busts in yelling and has what looks like a weapon I Yell, I do the yellow bro thing, but I also probably immediately attack them with the sheets.

940
00:53:48,454 --> 00:53:49,830
Rym: I just throw the sheets at their face.

941
00:53:49,970 --> 00:53:54,891
Scott: I mean, I'd probably be you know defending with the pillow hoping they can like a knife gets caught in the I'd be doing other Things.

942
00:53:54,911 --> 00:53:56,698
Rym: but like I immediately attack.

943
00:53:56,738 --> 00:54:01,941
Scott: but the primary thing I'm trying to do is just like talk to them Like why you're robbing me like if someone like.

944
00:54:01,961 --> 00:54:05,096
Scott: if I'm walking down the street and someone shows up to me There's like give me your phone.

945
00:54:05,136 --> 00:54:06,582
Scott: I'd be like really like.

946
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:08,230
Rym: really you want a hundred bucks instead.

947
00:54:09,292 --> 00:54:10,490
Scott: It's gotta find my iPhone.

948
00:54:11,451 --> 00:54:12,194
Scott: Sure, you want it.

949
00:54:12,576 --> 00:54:13,500
Rym: I'll give you my cash.

950
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:15,870
Scott: I mean if you're gonna stab me, I'll just give you the fucking phone.

951
00:54:15,870 --> 00:54:16,500
Scott: It's not a big deal.

952
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:20,250
Scott: Here you go Like I'm gonna call the cops as soon as you run away.

953
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:21,868
Scott: You sure you don't want to give him the phone back?

954
00:54:22,491 --> 00:54:30,279
Rym: I guess I would know regardless of any words that giver said I would not stop attacking them Until I had full control of the situation.

955
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:34,855
Rym: no matter what words they said, even if they said I'm just gonna rob you Probably still attack them.

956
00:54:35,056 --> 00:54:36,985
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know, there's definitely opportunity.

957
00:54:37,025 --> 00:54:38,150
Rym: No, no, they might be lying.

958
00:54:39,132 --> 00:54:41,149
Scott: There's definitely opportunities to see where things go.

959
00:54:41,431 --> 00:54:47,250
Scott: But I mean my primary technique is to just like talk to them and be like really you're robbing me.

960
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:48,558
Scott: I mean you're gonna take my credit card.

961
00:54:48,578 --> 00:54:49,665
Scott: I'm just gonna cancel that shit.

962
00:54:49,685 --> 00:54:49,946
Scott: Come on.

963
00:54:49,966 --> 00:54:50,530
Scott: Are you serious?

964
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:52,581
Rym: Yeah, of course, there's a big difference.

965
00:54:52,601 --> 00:54:54,799
Scott: like you're gonna stab me Okay, cuz now it's a murder.

966
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:58,970
Scott: the cops don't give a shit about a mugging But if you're suddenly a murder you're gonna have every cop in town over here.

967
00:54:58,990 --> 00:55:02,150
Rym: So to be fair though a mugging is much more opportunistic.

968
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:12,370
Rym: but home invasion like that already implies like a lot of premeditation and In a somewhat unhinged it's still not as nearly as bad as the consequences of murder.

969
00:55:12,431 --> 00:55:16,384
Rym: But if I was gonna rob a house I would rob a house that didn't have anyone in it.

970
00:55:16,424 --> 00:55:17,510
Rym: like I wait for them go to vacation.

971
00:55:18,333 --> 00:55:21,986
Scott: I hope my apartment got burgled when I wasn't there and the cops didn't even bother.

972
00:55:22,026 --> 00:55:23,792
Scott: but if they do I'd follow you Okay book.

973
00:55:23,872 --> 00:55:25,919
Scott: I know when you're on vacation and then I robbed your house.

974
00:55:25,999 --> 00:55:35,330
Scott: if they had murdered me or it assaulted me in some Way, the cops would have definitely put in much more effort into finding their asses and it wouldn't have been that hard.

975
00:55:35,611 --> 00:55:48,236
Rym: It's because all they did was a home invasion with a weapon implies Dangerous and crazy because home alone is the style to go except if there's a home alone kid in the house Just rob all the other neighbors houses.

976
00:55:48,337 --> 00:55:51,910
Scott: Also, you know, I can call 911 silently in my phone.

977
00:55:52,592 --> 00:55:55,401
Rym: I I would fight all their father burgling because I couldn't.

978
00:55:55,522 --> 00:55:57,950
Rym: I couldn't dial 9-1-1 on my phone while I was fighting them.

979
00:55:58,050 --> 00:56:02,620
Rym: It has an emergency button on the front like, you know, yeah that takes a few clicks though I gotta swipe up and then hit.

980
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:03,467
Scott: it's right next to my.

981
00:56:05,215 --> 00:56:05,457
Rym: How many?

982
00:56:05,497 --> 00:56:06,504
Rym: how quickly could I download?

983
00:56:06,524 --> 00:56:06,705
Rym: no one.

984
00:56:06,746 --> 00:56:11,220
Rym: let's see swipe emergency call 9-1, okay, I do like four clicks here.

985
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:13,150
Scott: Hmm, but you can do it as soon as you know.

986
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:14,680
Scott: You get a chance as soon as you can right?

987
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:16,210
Scott: Yeah, and you don't even need to say anything.

988
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:19,050
Scott: You can just sort of leave it on speaker and with the volume all the way down.

989
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:20,838
Scott: So you don't hear the 9-1-1, but they hear you.

990
00:56:21,059 --> 00:56:23,470
Scott: Yep, and they would get the idea of what's going on.

991
00:56:24,891 --> 00:56:26,758
Rym: Alright, I think I killed enough time.

992
00:56:26,778 --> 00:56:27,721
