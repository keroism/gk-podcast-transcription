1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:08,840
Scott:

2
00:00:08,635 --> 00:00:12,293
Rym: It's Monday August 7th 2017.

3
00:00:12,293 --> 00:00:12,774
Rym: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:12,934 --> 00:00:17,949
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight the AV technology of public speaking.

5
00:00:19,591 --> 00:00:20,625
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:22,316 --> 00:00:27,460
Rym: So as you guys know I Basically am a product manager like my day job is a product manager.

7
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:28,905
Rym: So that means a lot of things.

8
00:00:28,985 --> 00:00:47,869
Rym: but I encountered a problem that was kind of funny Because most of the software I have product managed or dealt with and basically my entire professional career Has been like back-end enterprise software like the crap that a company uses to manage their nonsense or like

9
00:00:48,271 --> 00:00:48,934
Scott: monitoring

10
00:00:48,954 --> 00:00:51,143
Rym: of like IT operations and all that kind of crap.

11
00:00:51,786 --> 00:00:59,110
Rym: so uh Very rarely our operating systems other than Windows or maybe Linux used in those kinds of places.

12
00:00:59,895 --> 00:01:02,834
Rym: But anyway, I got a ticket came across my desk And it was.

13
00:01:03,236 --> 00:01:07,598
Rym: it was notable because I saw something that I have not Ever seen.

14
00:01:07,638 --> 00:01:10,070
Rym: I guess I've seen it maybe once in my entire professional career.

15
00:01:11,011 --> 00:01:30,804
Rym: someone was complaining that something didn't work on OS X. all right, and basically, I got this swing GUI for like this enterprise II software and someone want like Java web start even someone wants to run it on Their Mac and you might think but Rym and Scott isn't Java portable?

16
00:01:31,285 --> 00:01:32,770
Rym: and the answer is now with gooies.

17
00:01:34,071 --> 00:01:39,470
Rym: The reality is that very little GUI code is portable in a reasonable way unless it's a web page.

18
00:01:40,312 --> 00:01:42,084
Scott: So I mean a swing GUI was gonna.

19
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:42,810
Scott: It's gonna work.

20
00:01:42,911 --> 00:01:43,920
Scott: It's just not gonna look.

21
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:44,828
Scott: it's gonna look weird.

22
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:54,402
Rym: No so on Linux because generally most people who make swing gooies these days either make a it's like on Linux only or Expected to be mostly on Linux or suspected mostly on Windows.

23
00:01:54,462 --> 00:01:56,270
Rym: if you could like mess with the look and feel.

24
00:01:56,711 --> 00:01:58,770
Scott: No one's testing it and all the different.

25
00:01:59,592 --> 00:02:01,117
Scott: But you know it's gonna load.

26
00:02:01,679 --> 00:02:16,552
Rym: so yet on OS X what I found because I recall this coming up But maybe one time ever my life is that a lot of swing gooies Just won't load on OS X now in the old days like the old old days or even like old like like Apple before OS 10.

27
00:02:16,552 --> 00:02:19,460
Rym: The problem is usually that Mac's had their own Java.

28
00:02:20,122 --> 00:02:22,730
Rym: You know there's like Oracle Java, and then there's Apple Java.

29
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,476
Rym: Yeah, and Apple Java just didn't work for shit.

30
00:02:24,497 --> 00:02:27,689
Rym: with most swing gooies especially with Java web star was involved.

31
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:32,790
Rym: no But in the modern era they kind of dropped that and you can just put Oracle Java there.

32
00:02:33,374 --> 00:02:35,167
Rym: And there's a lot of reasons why we know

33
00:02:36,811 --> 00:02:39,201
Scott: You're not supposed to even have Java these days if you can avoid it

34
00:02:39,342 --> 00:02:47,889
Rym: yep, but there's a lot of OS specific calls that you can make in gooies and oftentimes you end up having to make those just to make a thing work.

35
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:49,794
Rym: and Frankly I was shocked.

36
00:02:49,814 --> 00:03:08,190
Rym: this thing even worked in Linux because one of the things this thing can do is on its own internally generate a PDF Using system libraries and system calls and that worked on Linux amazingly, but can't even get to that point on OS X. So that was just interesting.

37
00:03:08,371 --> 00:03:15,095
Rym: And I'm really shocked that someone's using OS X in the world that I live in and I almost want to find out more about Like what the deal is like.

38
00:03:15,175 --> 00:03:19,210
Scott: why is OS X is really popular, but I just is weird for a finance person.

39
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:24,812
Rym: It's weird for like someone who does operations or like DevOps to run a Mac Mmm.

40
00:03:24,993 --> 00:03:27,561
Scott: I mean and not I mean anywhere else, but finance.

41
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:29,867
Scott: That's not unusual at all, but in finance.

42
00:03:29,887 --> 00:03:35,521
Rym: It's unusual yeah It's unusual in like industrial DevOps as well I think for a lot of reasons.

43
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:40,063
Scott: it's certain industries But you know overall the most office II type places.

44
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:49,510
Rym: you're gonna see a lot of Macs going on yeah But at the same time most office II places don't really have DevOps Mmm, or if they do that's usually like a separate team or it's outsourced software.

45
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:59,465
Rym: But yeah the funniest thing was we literally didn't have like any Macs to even test on because that's not even the thing we support.

46
00:03:59,485 --> 00:04:00,650
Scott: you went to the Apple store and bought one.

47
00:04:00,731 --> 00:04:03,070
Rym: So well actually I borrowed the CEO just has a MacBook.

48
00:04:03,271 --> 00:04:09,001
Rym: So I just borrowed it from him and likes plopped in the developers desk And I was like let's see if this even works at all.

49
00:04:09,242 --> 00:04:11,370
Rym: Let's go have fun spend a day poking at this.

50
00:04:13,111 --> 00:04:14,255
Rym: So yeah, it's Monday.

51
00:04:14,275 --> 00:04:14,516
Rym: Well.

52
00:04:14,536 --> 00:04:15,820
Rym: We'll talk about why.

53
00:04:15,861 --> 00:04:22,481
Rym: that's notable when we get to metamoment, but there is a lot of news and As always GeekNights Monday is not just about technology.

54
00:04:22,501 --> 00:04:24,670
Rym: It's about the social ramifications of technology.

55
00:04:24,951 --> 00:04:26,295
Scott: It should just be about technology.

56
00:04:26,436 --> 00:04:29,827
Rym: Yeah, you really want to talk about how gedit doesn't have a maintainer anymore.

57
00:04:29,847 --> 00:04:31,454
Scott: That's not Interesting.

58
00:04:31,835 --> 00:04:36,764
Scott: whether even if you are talking about name an interesting technology news There aren't a lot.

59
00:04:36,805 --> 00:04:42,819
Rym: yeah Plus I feel like colloquially Technology news basically covers the shit.

60
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:44,304
Rym: That's on like gizmodo and whatever.

61
00:04:44,425 --> 00:04:45,950
Scott: I mean most technology news.

62
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:55,957
Scott: I've said this a zillion times, but 90% of technology news is actually either Business news or it's some other kind of news But it's like related to technology.

63
00:04:55,978 --> 00:05:00,897
Scott: somehow like you'll see some news that should be in the finance part of the newspaper But because it's about Google.

64
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:02,426
Scott: It's in the tech part of the newspaper.

65
00:05:02,486 --> 00:05:03,832
Scott: It's like really Well.

66
00:05:03,852 --> 00:05:07,082
Rym: the funniest thing is that we also technically when we founded GeekNights.

67
00:05:07,263 --> 00:05:11,080
Rym: You know 12 years ago Monday is Science and technology.

68
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,710
Rym: Where's the last time we talked about science?

69
00:05:14,311 --> 00:05:19,289
Rym: There is a news about a big radio telescope in China that literally can't hire anyone to run it.

70
00:05:19,771 --> 00:05:20,093
Scott: Why not?

71
00:05:20,455 --> 00:05:22,770
Rym: because there's no one qualified enough who's willing to work there?

72
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,265
Scott: no, and they don't have a Chinese person.

73
00:05:26,567 --> 00:05:35,929
Rym: the Requirements of the job from what I can gather There's maybe like someone said that there's maybe between 20 and 40 people in the world who are qualified to do that kind of job.

74
00:05:37,012 --> 00:05:39,299
Scott: They can't trains who was doing it before no one.

75
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,469
Rym: it's a new new radio telescope as far as I can tell who made it.

76
00:05:42,933 --> 00:05:43,276
Rym: I don't know.

77
00:05:43,317 --> 00:05:48,570
Rym: I didn't person who made it should be Talk about science because you know how much I know about this.

78
00:05:48,771 --> 00:05:49,454
Rym: No, I read.

79
00:05:49,835 --> 00:05:52,949
Rym: I read a two-sentence summary of an article that I didn't click on.

80
00:05:52,989 --> 00:05:56,682
Scott: yet I just can't imagine whoever made the thing knows how to operate it.

81
00:05:56,722 --> 00:05:58,569
Scott: that person's job is not operating it.

82
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:01,600
Scott: Uh, so I or training someone to operate it.

83
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,704
Scott: Yeah, it's.

84
00:06:02,724 --> 00:06:04,210
Rym: no it's not just operating it.

85
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,329
Scott: Have you ever built something you don't know how to use?

86
00:06:08,358 --> 00:06:10,334
Rym: Yeah, yeah I have that have you?

87
00:06:10,354 --> 00:06:15,850
Rym: I have built things that have great UX's to do tasks that I do not fully understand.

88
00:06:16,951 --> 00:06:18,035
Rym: That is the thing I have done.

89
00:06:18,597 --> 00:06:19,299
Rym: that has happened.

90
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:22,590
Scott: But I mean we're talking like someone manufactured this physical.

91
00:06:22,731 --> 00:06:25,730
Rym: No, the job is not like point the radio telescope.

92
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,902
Rym: The job is like manage the entire operation of the telescope facility.

93
00:06:30,183 --> 00:06:32,670
Rym: radio telescopes aren't just devices their entire facilities.

94
00:06:33,531 --> 00:06:37,083
Rym: Like this involves like managing the physical plant.

95
00:06:37,284 --> 00:06:39,170
Rym: see I threw that word in there and all that nonsense.

96
00:06:39,511 --> 00:06:45,889
Rym: But again, I know two sentences more about this story than you do and that's why I'm not talking about it on GeekNights.

97
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:53,890
Rym: I brought it up as an illustrative point as to why we don't talk about science on GeekNights because we are not scientists.

98
00:06:54,755 --> 00:07:03,168
Rym: I remember like eight years ago We said something we we said one thing about viruses and got three complaints about how wrong we were from scientists.

99
00:07:03,248 --> 00:07:03,428
Scott: Mm-hmm.

100
00:07:04,752 --> 00:07:05,794
Scott: So yeah, we so wrong.

101
00:07:05,955 --> 00:07:14,096
Rym: but at the same time this news is pretty closely cloven to Technology as it is practice.

102
00:07:14,116 --> 00:07:20,094
Scott: Well, I mean this has been the biggest news of tech all week is basically someone who works at Google Sent out.

103
00:07:20,175 --> 00:07:32,650
Scott: I guess I don't know how some screed some sort of internal Documentation or internal Communicate is at best a diatribe, but I would probably simply just call it a incoherent screen.

104
00:07:32,831 --> 00:07:40,800
Scott: It's just a memo from a that guy who works at Google to all the other Google employees And basically saying all the that guy stuff.

105
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:41,262
Scott: Yep.

106
00:07:41,523 --> 00:07:43,730
Scott: His diversity stuff is no good.

107
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:47,282
Rym: Yeah, I mean all the women who work with me are incompetent.

108
00:07:47,442 --> 00:07:49,670
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know, there's genetic differences.

109
00:07:49,771 --> 00:07:52,792
Scott: That's why they don't know how to use a computer Like the dirt.

110
00:07:52,812 --> 00:07:57,490
Rym: but they're all that awful nonsense that's always there in the undercurrent of like every technology.

111
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:02,988
Scott: So, I mean there's nothing really to say about the the dude and his his you know memo or whatever.

112
00:08:03,008 --> 00:08:03,530
Scott: that is that guy.

113
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,059
Scott: Yeah, this is that guy.

114
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:12,410
Scott: But what I do want to talk about is How that guy got to work at Google in the first place, right?

115
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:20,570
Scott: They have these crazy interview processes with multi layers of you know And all this stuff and you have to be really skilled to even work at Google, right?

116
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:23,942
Scott: Because even though they're paying a lot and desperate to hire people all the time.

117
00:08:23,982 --> 00:08:24,885
Scott: They're still choosy.

118
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:26,350
Scott: They reject tons of people.

119
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:28,056
Scott: Yeah, so why?

120
00:08:28,136 --> 00:08:29,661
Scott: how is it that they let?

121
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:32,289
Scott: and you know, there's even a part of the hiring process.

122
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,981
Scott: We're like a whole bunch of people have to give unanimous thumbs up.

123
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,230
Scott: even one thumbs down on you will make you not hired.

124
00:08:37,337 --> 00:08:37,510
Rym: Yep.

125
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:43,208
Scott: Now I think now that did qualify that this guy got unanimous thumbs up from several all everyone who interviewed him.

126
00:08:44,053 --> 00:08:45,900
Rym: Alright, so that thumbs up thumbs down thing.

127
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,370
Rym: I think that only applies to certain management positions.

128
00:08:49,156 --> 00:08:57,130
Scott: The point is someone who is a who has Working at Google and is in a position high enough such that they can share a memo with the entire company.

129
00:08:57,832 --> 00:08:59,075
Scott: Everyone at all of Google.

130
00:08:59,295 --> 00:08:59,556
Rym: Yep.

131
00:08:59,797 --> 00:09:06,156
Scott: I mean credit was hired by Google's very very supposedly thorough and difficult interview process.

132
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:18,584
Rym: as we learned from key girl con a lot of organizations even big ones have a way to send a message to a lot of people and I Can email team at my current company and send something to literally everyone who works for

133
00:09:18,604 --> 00:09:28,590
Scott: I actually have an access to an email System where I could send email from anyone so I could send it legit verify DKM emails like from the CEO to whoever.

134
00:09:29,414 --> 00:09:29,795
Rym: You know what?

135
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:32,709
Rym: Actually I if I wanted to I could do the same thing.

136
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:35,657
Scott: I would not receive the replies.

137
00:09:35,697 --> 00:09:36,780
Scott: the CEO would receive them.

138
00:09:37,021 --> 00:09:37,282
Scott: Yeah.

139
00:09:37,603 --> 00:09:38,585
Scott: Yeah, I could send.

140
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:46,390
Scott: I could send emails from the CEO Well or anyone else I guess an emails from Rym, yeah, well because you managed our email system.

141
00:09:46,691 --> 00:09:49,928
Scott: So yeah, I'm you know, but at night I could do Rym at Broadway.

142
00:09:49,948 --> 00:09:50,109
Scott: calm.

143
00:09:51,256 --> 00:09:57,146
Rym: Well think of it this way like, you know I used to work in DevOps right like for a broker dealer like big deal for all the security in the world.

144
00:09:57,166 --> 00:10:02,765
Rym: in the end There's a small number of people who have root on a system that could theoretically do anything.

145
00:10:02,825 --> 00:10:05,810
Rym: cuz like there's root I get used for things sometimes.

146
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:10,242
Scott: Anyway, the point is they hired this guy even with their crazy interview process.

147
00:10:10,283 --> 00:10:17,488
Scott: and what this tells me and is something that I need People to realize right is that there are people at Google.

148
00:10:17,508 --> 00:10:26,643
Scott: this, you know Even though this guy is clearly a minority if you at least judging by the voices on the internet Yeah, and you know from what I'm not an oppressed minority the literal opposite of that.

149
00:10:26,764 --> 00:10:28,750
Scott: No, he's a physical minority.

150
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:29,070
Scott: You know what?

151
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:33,646
Scott: It's like if you counted all the Google employees and forced them to vote yay or nay on this guy.

152
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:37,329
Scott: with no other voting option You would get mostly nays on this guy.

153
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:41,866
Rym: yep, because when you meet of that guy most people realize he's that guy.

154
00:10:41,966 --> 00:10:54,691
Scott: you would get a Scary number of yeas, even though they're less than the nays People who agree with this guy there is a scary number of them and they're working at Google a company with access to all your personal Information.

155
00:10:54,972 --> 00:10:58,221
Scott: so so the thing is it's not just the Google right.

156
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:02,253
Scott: you look at all these companies that like you're always complaining about stuff For example Twitter.

157
00:11:02,614 --> 00:11:04,920
Scott: why you know delete these insensitive tweets.

158
00:11:05,241 --> 00:11:08,430
Scott: YouTube why you not close the accounts on all these videos?

159
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,833
Scott: Yeah, right and they're.

160
00:11:09,933 --> 00:11:16,030
Scott: part of the reason is because the people working there some of them are that guys.

161
00:11:16,431 --> 00:11:19,845
Scott: Yeah, they don't just fire all of that guys like they should like.

162
00:11:19,926 --> 00:11:22,289
Scott: I would in fact I wouldn't hire them in the first place.

163
00:11:22,591 --> 00:11:35,270
Rym: But as we learned on the rail ride once again for whatever reason you and I have this like Dunyane like ability to see that guy from a meet from the furthest horizon.

164
00:11:35,433 --> 00:11:42,906
Rym: We see them in the distance And we're like that guy and then they open their mouth and we look at each other and we're like confirm Can I get a job where all I do is?

165
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:43,931
Scott: Companies?

166
00:11:43,951 --> 00:11:52,560
Scott: when they're interviewing people I come in and interview them as like a disinterested party just to tell when it comes to Specifically the misogynistic version of that guy.

167
00:11:52,621 --> 00:11:56,895
Rym: The one thing I can say is that well, this is like a racist and Misogyny.

168
00:11:57,178 --> 00:12:05,684
Rym: I can say pretty definitively Any woman who talks to that guy for even a second realizes it immediately.

169
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,470
Scott: you think how many people at Google?

170
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,978
Scott: Do you think we're interviewed by even one woman?

171
00:12:10,038 --> 00:12:11,564
Rym: That's what I'm getting at.

172
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:17,547
Rym: even the purpose of diversity Google isn't just to meet some quota of like this.

173
00:12:17,607 --> 00:12:20,754
Scott: many of this Interviewed this guy.

174
00:12:21,015 --> 00:12:27,196
Scott: where that guys it is very unlikely that any of them Were ladies or not white people.

175
00:12:27,216 --> 00:12:32,210
Rym: but the purpose of diversity is to literally have a diversity of perspective and opinions.

176
00:12:32,392 --> 00:12:37,782
Rym: so if Some women had interviewed that guy they might have recognized it was that guy.

177
00:12:37,842 --> 00:12:44,172
Rym: but it's even more subtle than that because I've been through Google's interview process multiple times.

178
00:12:44,272 --> 00:12:48,359
Rym: I've actually gone through a lot of interview processes over the years partly just to see.

179
00:12:48,379 --> 00:12:54,634
Rym: and There is a common thread with tech companies like Google.

180
00:12:55,376 --> 00:13:05,767
Rym: they seem to Narrowly focus the parameters of how their applicants are rated to exclude Testing for that guy?

181
00:13:05,988 --> 00:13:08,580
Rym: testing for empathy testing for racism?

182
00:13:09,001 --> 00:13:10,185
Rym: They mostly test for.

183
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,393
Rym: can you do an arbitrary logic puzzle?

184
00:13:13,015 --> 00:13:14,320
Rym: Can you talk about?

185
00:13:15,402 --> 00:13:17,518
Rym: the business process that we're hiring you for?

186
00:13:18,661 --> 00:13:26,634
Rym: Finding out if you have domain knowledge finding out if you have basic intelligence like they Really constrain what they're asking about and what they're interviewing about.

187
00:13:27,175 --> 00:13:30,134
Rym: They don't ask about hobbies they don't ask about like your real life.

188
00:13:30,598 --> 00:13:40,010
Rym: and They don't do the thing like when I interview people I ask subtle shibboleth questions because I'm looking for things like Do you use keywords that imply that you know the things?

189
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,177
Rym: I don't have to actually grow your technology skills.

190
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:53,113
Rym: I Give them the opportunities to use shibboleths that might appear on say red pill or Storm for you know, the kinds of things that a normal person would never say.

191
00:13:53,635 --> 00:14:03,009
Rym: but if a white dude I'm talking to says certain words I pretty much assume they're a Nazi or a racist and just discount them immediately Like I try to find that out.

192
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:08,952
Scott: and just in case anyone wasn't aware in the United States We had the freedom of speech whatever but you don't have.

193
00:14:08,972 --> 00:14:10,880
Scott: you have no freedom of speech at work.

194
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:20,679
Scott: So you I could literally fires if I was a boss of a company and someone walked in with an Eagles Jersey I legally could and Maybe would fire them.

195
00:14:21,242 --> 00:14:26,786
Scott: Well, yeah, just for that reason and no other reason and the law would just be like, all right Yeah, you can do that.

196
00:14:27,088 --> 00:14:35,308
Rym: My most company has worked for in Subordination to your direct line manager is a fireable offense Even if the dress code was like.

197
00:14:35,348 --> 00:14:39,289
Scott: you may wear sports jerseys it because the see I'm the CEO I own the company.

198
00:14:39,309 --> 00:14:40,300
Scott: you can make an arbitrary rule.

199
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,500
Scott: No, we can just be like, I don't fuck the Eagles what that who even hired you Eagles fan get fuck out of here.

200
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,151
Scott: You got it.

201
00:14:46,172 --> 00:14:52,400
Rym: Goodbye But that basically the whole system of hiring in most of technology.

202
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:56,615
Scott: so obviously if you can do that you can fire this guy for no other reason than this memo.

203
00:14:56,776 --> 00:14:58,081
Scott: but and you wouldn't get you Couldn't?

204
00:14:58,101 --> 00:15:02,260
Rym: you couldn't fight back though that guys who have infiltrated, you know real society.

205
00:15:02,682 --> 00:15:16,286
Rym: there's sort of an extra subtle problem where they coach their Vile opinions under the guise of every argument having two sides and every argument having equal weight or Fake science.

206
00:15:16,567 --> 00:15:24,998
Rym: Yep by simplifying or making story They'll use the word objectivity and have no idea what that word actually means or have no like.

207
00:15:25,038 --> 00:15:25,720
Rym: they use that word.

208
00:15:26,081 --> 00:15:32,140
Scott: They use the word objectivity right because they're only discussing, you know, like oh, I'm just gonna tell it's a genetic difference.

209
00:15:32,382 --> 00:15:34,459
Scott: I'm making a scientific argument here, right?

210
00:15:34,781 --> 00:15:37,110
Scott: I'm not saying anything about feelings or any.

211
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,520
Scott: it's just all numbers and genes and stuff.

212
00:15:39,922 --> 00:15:43,277
Scott: but your information is inaccurate that you are using.

213
00:15:43,378 --> 00:15:47,712
Rym: so Yep, but uh, I don't know.

214
00:15:47,732 --> 00:15:49,520
Rym: I mean, I don't know what to do about this.

215
00:15:49,881 --> 00:15:58,336
Rym: I feel like the problem would fix itself if there were a More diverse and empathetic circuit of how job interviews are done.

216
00:15:58,476 --> 00:15:59,620
Rym: I think I can't happen.

217
00:15:59,721 --> 00:16:01,915
Rym: It's just because the intention is chicken already there.

218
00:16:02,016 --> 00:16:02,620
Scott: It's a chicken egg.

219
00:16:02,902 --> 00:16:04,579
Scott: Companies already have these people there.

220
00:16:05,001 --> 00:16:10,480
Scott: So it's how can you become more diverse if the people making hiring decisions are these people?

221
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:11,823
Scott: Right to begin with.

222
00:16:11,964 --> 00:16:14,655
Rym: so the other day I was on the subway basically had to just fire everyone.

223
00:16:14,675 --> 00:16:21,284
Scott: and then you know Like if I started a company, I thought like I should have a rule that if you know, even sadly I'm a white dude.

224
00:16:21,887 --> 00:16:24,180
Scott: If I make a company I should be the only white dude there.

225
00:16:24,301 --> 00:16:27,019
Scott: Everyone else should either be only straight white dude.

226
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,695
Scott: Every single other person at are you 100% straight?

227
00:16:31,739 --> 00:16:39,020
Scott: I mean Like every single other person at the company besides me should be not dude not white not straight.

228
00:16:39,341 --> 00:16:41,029
Scott: Well, at least one of the three or

229
00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:56,540
Rym: the very least like I guess when I whenever it like is, you know I am in an industry that's heavily male at least is I pretty much always tried to give anyone who's not like me Way more benefit of the doubt and sort of always do the opposite for anyone who is like a cishet white.

230
00:16:57,507 --> 00:16:58,899
Rym: But even that is not enough.

231
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:05,871
Scott: Yeah, if you're a white dude you better you got to be like fucking amazing for me to Being hired right cuz it is shocking.

232
00:17:06,051 --> 00:17:12,919
Scott: Well, I guess I also I also give Sometimes I'll give credit to like, you know straight white dudes at least if they're from a different country.

233
00:17:13,301 --> 00:17:13,988
Scott: No, right.

234
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:14,592
Scott: Yeah.

235
00:17:14,613 --> 00:17:15,540
Rym: Well, it's more matter.

236
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:20,999
Rym: you got to put everything in context, but in this case like these people exist throughout technology.

237
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:26,409
Rym: and I saw I've ran into these two dudes on the subway Not that long ago.

238
00:17:26,489 --> 00:17:28,020
Rym: I was just sitting on the subway long train home.

239
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:39,247
Rym: we were stuck and these two white dudes who are in their like mid 20s are standing there and they must have just met at like a networking event and I think they both worked in finance because they they had that look and they had that attitude and they had that dress

240
00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:39,651
Scott: I know.

241
00:17:39,672 --> 00:17:48,392
Rym: and They're talking to each other and like it's so hard to date in the city and the subways cars totally quiet so everyone on the subway car is just giving them the side.

242
00:17:48,432 --> 00:18:00,200
Rym: I listening to them and slowly They come out to each other as being conservative Mm-hmm, and then immediately they're like, oh man and they hug each other and they're like you just can't talk about this stuff.

243
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:11,120
Rym: Like if I say anything about Trump and I don't like really like rag on him then like any woman I'm dating just like immediately breaks up with me and like I have to hide this and like I'm afraid to come out to them.

244
00:18:11,763 --> 00:18:15,500
Rym: And it's apparent that shitheads like that are the minority.

245
00:18:16,068 --> 00:18:21,650
Rym: but they've infiltrated Organizations and because of the way hiring is done.

246
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:27,307
Rym: They are not selected out of those organizations and they have undue power in those organizations.

247
00:18:27,869 --> 00:18:42,416
Rym: and it was weird to see two of the most privileged people I've ever met on the subway Using all the language of an oppressed minority to talk about the fact that they feel Discriminated against because their political opinions are literally vile.

248
00:18:42,436 --> 00:18:42,737
Rym: Mm-hmm.

249
00:18:43,802 --> 00:18:48,039
Rym: so in other news This has been making the rounds but you know Hyperloop.

250
00:18:50,107 --> 00:18:51,759
Rym: I don't want to talk about the technology of it.

251
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:57,784
Scott: Listen if there's some crazy guy out there who says he's got another fucking like perpetual motion machine He doesn't make the news, right?

252
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:02,740
Scott: Why just cuz it's Elon Musk rich asshole who used to work who has money because he worked at PayPal.

253
00:19:04,321 --> 00:19:05,547
Scott: How he does the crazy?

254
00:19:05,588 --> 00:19:06,814
Scott: perpetually no idea.

255
00:19:06,974 --> 00:19:08,100
Scott: and suddenly it's in the news.

256
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,310
Scott: It's like why do we got to talk about it?

257
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,580
Scott: Just cuz some rich guys doing it.

258
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:22,699
Rym: well, there's a big difference between a crazy, you know crazy guy has a vision for how we're gonna connect the subways together across the whole country and Same crazy guy also has billions of dollars to throw at it.

259
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:25,853
Scott: Yeah, but it's like, you know, just the rich guy just writing the news.

260
00:19:25,913 --> 00:19:27,520
Scott: It's like I'm tired of hearing about this asshole.

261
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:36,088
Rym: Yeah but so on one hand It's easy for armchair engineers like us even to point out the flaws in the system because we don't actually like.

262
00:19:36,229 --> 00:19:59,960
Rym: I haven't read all the papers on the engineering of Hyperloop and how Feasible it actually is but there's a narrative that's been poking around in the media lately Saying that It's actually way more feasible to build than people realize and the primary thing holding it back Is that city governments and state governments and federal governments aren't willing to give?

263
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,373
Rym: Permits to actually build these things.

264
00:20:02,393 --> 00:20:03,680
Scott: Yeah, I'm tired of reading news.

265
00:20:03,741 --> 00:20:05,301
Scott: That is about you know The news.

266
00:20:05,402 --> 00:20:07,811
Scott: rich guys are doing this and the news is also.

267
00:20:08,052 --> 00:20:11,143
Scott: this is written by a rich guy so that it's easier for him To do what he wants.

268
00:20:11,405 --> 00:20:11,666
Rym: Yep.

269
00:20:12,268 --> 00:20:15,220
Scott: So you think I must write paid for those stories or you know.

270
00:20:15,802 --> 00:20:20,220
Scott: Or basically hung out with reporters and got him to write those stories or his PR people did it?

271
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,660
Scott: You know because he's basically blaming everyone else for his problems.

272
00:20:22,861 --> 00:20:24,994
Scott: It's like but I feel like the okay rich guy.

273
00:20:25,034 --> 00:20:25,960
Scott: we should bend over for you.

274
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:26,542
Scott: No, how about?

275
00:20:26,562 --> 00:20:28,288
Scott: we should make things harder for you of anything?

276
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:32,100
Rym: It's not just coming up with a good technology idea.

277
00:20:32,221 --> 00:20:34,110
Rym: This is true of war.

278
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:37,966
Rym: This is true of space travel And this is true of mass transit.

279
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:45,060
Rym: a good idea or even a good technology or even a provable working Technology is not actually the hard part.

280
00:20:45,622 --> 00:20:50,140
Rym: I mean there already exists way better subway cars than what we have in New York City today.

281
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,546
Scott: Yeah, we can have subway.

282
00:20:51,787 --> 00:20:59,040
Scott: they exist today subway trains that are awesome luxurious fast safe and drive themselves.

283
00:20:59,584 --> 00:21:03,586
Scott: We don't need to invent anything new We just need to buy them and install them.

284
00:21:04,028 --> 00:21:06,916
Rym: but buying them installing them is a complicated process because

285
00:21:07,157 --> 00:21:11,393
Scott: probably a trillion dollar Hundreds of billions of dollars the same

286
00:21:11,494 --> 00:21:21,989
Rym: taxpayer driven municipal and state and federal tax system that would pay for that is the same taxes and has to pay for like Education and there's not infinite money.

287
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:23,174
Rym: So which one do you pick?

288
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:24,680
Rym: or like feasibility?

289
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,787
Rym: Oh, we'll just build a tunnel under New York City.

290
00:21:27,269 --> 00:21:28,173
Rym: Good fucking luck.

291
00:21:28,234 --> 00:21:29,740
Rym: building a tunnel under New York City.

292
00:21:30,182 --> 00:21:33,840
Rym: No one knows what's down there like literally no one.

293
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:41,426
Scott: I read that the Second Avenue subway at least is way deeper than it needed to be and in fact That's why it costs so much money.

294
00:21:41,487 --> 00:21:42,732
Scott: is because they made it so deep.

295
00:21:42,792 --> 00:22:01,111
Scott: and the reason they made it so deep is Because to make it at the normal depth, which is would have been possible to do would have required Just a lot of wrangling of bureaucracy to get various utilities like phone water gas internet Etc Verizon you got Verizon Con Edison, etc.

296
00:22:01,372 --> 00:22:03,480
Scott: to all get their shit together, right?

297
00:22:04,622 --> 00:22:10,120
Scott: There wasn't enough political will to get those people in the room and force them to get their shit together.

298
00:22:10,601 --> 00:22:15,457
Scott: So instead they just spent a huge pile of money to just dig deeper and avoid all because it's like.

299
00:22:15,778 --> 00:22:23,167
Scott: well same time Rather waste a bunch of money then do some work now So that bureaucracy like digging deeper.

300
00:22:23,187 --> 00:22:32,862
Rym: it might in the end of cost just as much to act because that bureaucracy is protecting poorly documented and physically Difficult situation.

301
00:22:32,922 --> 00:22:35,370
Scott: right but you could have gotten it done.

302
00:22:35,531 --> 00:22:40,180
Scott: and the thing is if you would have got made on it wouldn't have cost taxpayers money to get it done.

303
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:44,680
Scott: It would have cost all those companies money to get it done because you basically just write a law base.

304
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:50,103
Scott: Effectively that says you all have to sort your shit out because the subway is coming through and we're gonna have meetings to sort Your shit out.

305
00:22:50,143 --> 00:22:50,686
Scott: that doesn't cost.

306
00:22:50,707 --> 00:22:51,713
Scott: so it's not taxpayers?

307
00:22:51,773 --> 00:22:52,055
Scott: anything.

308
00:22:52,075 --> 00:22:52,820
Rym: not quite that easy.

309
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,519
Rym: So I was researching this a little bit and I learned some fun stuff about even like the big dig, right?

310
00:22:57,821 --> 00:23:05,912
Rym: So literally digging those tunnels even after they forced all those changes and like had a guaranteed plan They ran into pipes that no one knew what they were.

311
00:23:05,932 --> 00:23:06,575
Rym: Mm-hmm.

312
00:23:06,917 --> 00:23:07,560
Rym: What do you do then?

313
00:23:08,141 --> 00:23:10,338
Rym: It's how much money it cost even to find out what that pipe is.

314
00:23:11,222 --> 00:23:16,560
Rym: One of them they ran into a pipe destroying the pipe and it also destroyed the tunnel boring machine.

315
00:23:17,442 --> 00:23:22,017
Rym: so then they had to put another tunnel boring machine in to get to the first one to fix it.

316
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:45,038
Rym: and the reality is Cities have huge amounts of infrastructure and the concerns go so much beyond simply having good technology That yes hyperloop might be technologically feasible But to make it pragmatically feasible is probably a 30 or 40 year project and I don't feel like the people involved in it Have the staying power to make that

317
00:23:45,118 --> 00:23:45,280
Scott: happen.

318
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:54,731
Scott: I also feel like in 30 or 40 years will invent something better and with that it'll be like oh this things have done And then it'll take us 30 or 40 years to get that in place.

319
00:23:54,952 --> 00:23:57,340
Rym: no meanwhile, we'll have just gotten new subway cars.

320
00:23:59,661 --> 00:24:00,985
Rym: So it's a complicated problem.

321
00:24:01,046 --> 00:24:02,711
Scott: is the teleporting in that time?

322
00:24:02,952 --> 00:24:07,986
Rym: so we did a show recently about passwords and Just to drive that point home.

323
00:24:08,568 --> 00:24:13,531
Rym: if you use last pass which seems to be the most popular of those passwords It's a very popular one.

324
00:24:13,733 --> 00:24:14,659
Scott: It's also I've heard of it.

325
00:24:14,961 --> 00:24:15,583
Rym: It's really like.

326
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:20,240
Rym: it's not perfectly secure, but it's pretty secure on average.

327
00:24:20,441 --> 00:24:22,712
Scott: I mean, it's it's had its problems.

328
00:24:22,873 --> 00:24:30,880
Scott: I would never use it personally I would never recommend using it, but if you must if your alternative is to do garbage, this is better than garbage.

329
00:24:31,363 --> 00:24:32,229
Rym: Oh, yeah, so guess what.

330
00:24:32,249 --> 00:24:33,740
Rym: it has a free tier and a paid tier, right?

331
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,301
Scott: What is that?

332
00:24:34,342 --> 00:24:36,310
Scott: What do you pay get for when you use the paid tier?

333
00:24:36,471 --> 00:24:38,560
Rym: if I know because I don't use services like this.

334
00:24:38,621 --> 00:24:49,979
Rym: But here's what's happening they're taking a bunch of the features that were in the free tier and moving them into the pay tier and they need money and They're substantially raising the price of the pay tier doubling it.

335
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,665
Rym: so here's some things this implies.

336
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:59,479
Rym: one if you ever rely on a free service either some day it's gonna cost you money.

337
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:04,513
Rym: or You're the product or it's fake like there aren't that many options.

338
00:25:05,175 --> 00:25:06,318
Rym: and two or someday.

339
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:06,940
Rym: I'd love to monetize.

340
00:25:08,282 --> 00:25:12,580
Rym: And two if they're doing this I worry that last pass is not financially viable.

341
00:25:13,564 --> 00:25:24,835
Rym: I don't think you want to trust a company that may be having financial trouble With the keys to your entire kingdom, yeah It's like Oh last pass just like shuts down because they ran out of money either.

342
00:25:24,855 --> 00:25:30,015
Scott: or you know Situation a of today is you might be forced to suddenly be paying.

343
00:25:30,135 --> 00:25:31,420
Scott: What does it cost for the pay tier?

344
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,680
Scott: I don't even know you might be forced to pay money.

345
00:25:33,861 --> 00:25:35,668
Rym: Oh, so one it's not.

346
00:25:35,688 --> 00:25:42,672
Rym: the last pass premium has now doubled in price to $24 a year, that's not that expensive.

347
00:25:42,913 --> 00:25:44,360
Scott: So yeah that big a deal.

348
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:49,780
Scott: But in principle, however, if they have they go under or something, it's like you're trapped.

349
00:25:50,001 --> 00:25:52,713
Scott: It is possibly screwed based on how they're.

350
00:25:52,813 --> 00:25:54,420
Scott: I don't know how exactly their system works.

351
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:57,570
Scott: If anything stored in the cloud that might disappear or who knows what.

352
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:01,376
Scott: yeah, you could potentially be in trouble if they like go out of business.

353
00:26:03,241 --> 00:26:10,320
Scott: Does all the systems that we recommended like dice where super Gen vest or even just making up passwords memorizing?

354
00:26:10,904 --> 00:26:12,940
Scott: It was password cards.

355
00:26:13,502 --> 00:26:22,319
Scott: None of those things can be suddenly shut down because you're not dependent on any cloud-based thing Yep, and cloud-based commercial venture has to make money somehow.

356
00:26:22,864 --> 00:26:28,091
Scott: mm-hmm, uh You definitely don't want to trust your security to someone with a profit motive.

357
00:26:28,512 --> 00:26:30,960
Rym: Nope, unless their profit motive is maintaining your security.

358
00:26:31,493 --> 00:26:38,439
Rym: maybe Like if Gmail had a serious like Google two-factor or like Gmail if there was a gigantic security hole.

359
00:26:38,479 --> 00:26:41,919
Rym: suddenly That would really hurt their ability to continue making money from it.

360
00:26:42,221 --> 00:26:48,400
Rym: They have a vested interest in a certain degree of security sure, but obviously there's a much deeper topic there.

361
00:26:48,783 --> 00:27:03,140
Rym: So really tiny news, but this is good news Even though you still can't trust Lenovo because they Lenovo does with that malware so long ago, but Lenovo is ditching all its Android nonsense and They're going to put stock Android on all their future smartphones.

362
00:27:03,441 --> 00:27:07,240
Scott: I heard that this is actually in response to customer demand, which is really interesting.

363
00:27:07,822 --> 00:27:09,408
Scott: Customers have demanded this forever.

364
00:27:09,488 --> 00:27:11,054
Scott: First of all, I've demanded.

365
00:27:11,074 --> 00:27:16,220
Scott: as long as Android phones have existed They're suddenly listening to customers, which is like, oh wow, they're listening to customers.

366
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:24,560
Scott: But then the other thing is well, why are other companies either a the customers aren't telling them this or be aren't listening to customers?

367
00:27:24,941 --> 00:27:29,394
Scott: Yeah, I mean well, so even Sony I still wouldn't buy Lenovo because Lenovo.

368
00:27:29,454 --> 00:27:37,640
Rym: but I mean I have a Sony phone and it's a weird phone and I love the Physicality of it so much that I put up with the fact that it's a Sony branch of Android.

369
00:27:38,442 --> 00:27:45,099
Rym: I think the only reason I've been able to put up with it is that it's like 98% stock and it doesn't get in my way.

370
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:48,371
Rym: and Shockingly, it actually is getting timely updates.

371
00:27:48,532 --> 00:27:57,940
Rym: Like I just get updates regularly yeah, so Even then I still would rather have stock Android and it bothers me that it's not stock Android.

372
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,449
Scott: Can't you just flash it with stock Android?

373
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:02,691
Rym: Uh, because it's a weird Sony phone I kind of don't want to go down that road.

374
00:28:02,711 --> 00:28:07,358
Rym: Mm-hmm Because I really really like this phone and it kind of works as is.

375
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:16,660
Rym: But this is kind of good news and I'm really hoping that this portends More people giving up on take Android and make it worse just for their own fun.

376
00:28:16,801 --> 00:28:27,181
Scott: I think what you'll see is if people start buying Lenovo phones Then if that gives them a competitive advantage in the marketplace if people choose Lenovo phones because of the stock You

377
00:28:27,221 --> 00:28:28,806
Rym: shouldn't because you can't trust Lenovo

378
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:35,676
Scott: right but you know if someone else won't listen to us right then you'll see Other companies be forced to do the same thing.

379
00:28:35,858 --> 00:28:44,680
Rym: Yeah so, uh, I Guess the last news is actually pretty interesting and there's a much broader topic here.

380
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:54,940
Rym: so this article is fairly just to get you thinking about it, but When GPS became commonly available and was usable by normal people that was actually a pretty big deal.

381
00:28:55,281 --> 00:28:58,212
Scott: GPS used to and was like first like a military.

382
00:28:58,392 --> 00:29:00,962
Scott: only thing like you couldn't access it Right.

383
00:29:01,082 --> 00:29:01,684
Scott: It was not a thing.

384
00:29:01,724 --> 00:29:06,220
Scott: normal people could not find out their exact latitude and longitude to several decimal digits.

385
00:29:06,501 --> 00:29:16,020
Scott: Yeah, you know it was just not available, you know, and then I think it was available to like maybe boat people next You know, like it was not a thing that was you know allowed.

386
00:29:16,141 --> 00:29:16,483
Scott: It's like

387
00:29:16,503 --> 00:29:17,147
Rym: there was like

388
00:29:17,207 --> 00:29:19,199
Scott: and now your phone can fucking do it really well

389
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:35,420
Rym: Yep, and the militaries of the world rely heavily on GPS because actually rangefinding target finding like Navigation if you don't know it like it is difficult to express briefly how utterly challenging those problems actually are.

390
00:29:35,661 --> 00:29:35,883
Scott: Right.

391
00:29:36,145 --> 00:29:38,440
Scott: It's it's basically the system is like kind of a miracle.

392
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,880
Scott: We have all these satellites in space that cost us a bunch of money But now they're up there.

393
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:46,929
Rym: So we're good and you can hit a button and see on a map exactly where your ship is Middle of the Pacific Ocean.

394
00:29:46,949 --> 00:30:02,423
Scott: satellites are basically covering hitting Almost the entire earth effectively the entire earth with these signals so that no matter where you are You can basically use a device to listen to this signal and do some math and then your device will tell you exactly your latitude and longitude.

395
00:30:02,946 --> 00:30:04,675
Scott: so and it's like it's freaking.

396
00:30:04,695 --> 00:30:13,720
Rym: fantastic, but Knowing where you are if GPS becomes unavailable is a difficult problem to say the least.

397
00:30:13,821 --> 00:30:15,051
Scott: But why would it become unavailable?

398
00:30:15,071 --> 00:30:16,080
Scott: It's satellites in space.

399
00:30:16,261 --> 00:30:22,200
Scott: What can anyone do besides like shoot out the satellites in space interfere with the GPS signals that aren't that strong or spoof them?

400
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:25,234
Rym: Or otherwise just jam them so that now your GPS can't get a lock.

401
00:30:25,375 --> 00:30:26,018
Scott: Can you do that?

402
00:30:26,078 --> 00:30:32,660
Rym: Yeah or Knock down the satellites, which is way easier than putting satellites up.

403
00:30:32,881 --> 00:30:34,085
Scott: It's definitely possible.

404
00:30:34,145 --> 00:30:36,715
Scott: But no, I don't think there has been to my knowledge.

405
00:30:36,735 --> 00:30:38,120
Scott: I keep thinking about that.

406
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:43,451
Rym: I've been thinking about that because there hasn't been a major war involving Equivtech countries about a certain level.

407
00:30:43,471 --> 00:30:45,280
Scott: I've been thinking about that for a long time.

408
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:49,040
Scott: Oh Scott, we don't want to take out the TV satellites, but how come Scott?

409
00:30:49,942 --> 00:30:54,880
Rym: Read so I'm weird and I read a lot about military technology.

410
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:59,554
Rym: Yeah I don't care about what that is a that has been a big fucking deal for a long time.

411
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:00,276
Rym: the.

412
00:31:00,377 --> 00:31:10,495
Rym: the theory goes that if there were ever a conflict between modern equiv tech nations like US and China, yeah, or They would just kill each other.

413
00:31:10,515 --> 00:31:11,000
Scott: satellites, right?

414
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:20,437
Rym: Like basically everyone would just destroy everyone else's satellites and everyone's in the dark because that hurts a country like the US Way more than it hurts another country.

415
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:23,865
Scott: Xcom help us.

416
00:31:23,945 --> 00:31:24,347
Scott: No.

417
00:31:24,467 --> 00:31:25,612
Scott: Yeah satellites.

418
00:31:25,693 --> 00:31:27,320
Scott: No, we can't X come without those.

419
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:39,469
Rym: So this is an article that will give you some flavors of information about the previous technology That was used before GPS and why it is so much harder to jam It's not quite as good.

420
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:41,340
Scott: Well uses antennas like on the ground.

421
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:48,595
Rym: Yeah and if you really want to go into this go read about how like Bombers found their targets during World War two.

422
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:49,400
Scott: isn't the way it works?

423
00:31:49,420 --> 00:32:02,186
Scott: You basically just have multiple antennas on the ground and broadcasting and you know where the antenna is Right because you program you hard code in like this antenna is at this coordinate and then your device picks up the radio signals From the very powerful antennas.

424
00:32:02,206 --> 00:32:02,668
Scott: You don't need that.

425
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:04,215
Scott: You just need to be in the radius.

426
00:32:04,276 --> 00:32:05,180
Scott: It's got alright.

427
00:32:05,461 --> 00:32:09,258
Rym: How do you tell based on a single radio signal how far away it is?

428
00:32:10,623 --> 00:32:11,832
Scott: So you had to be within two?

429
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,564
Scott: Towers not one.

430
00:32:14,624 --> 00:32:19,963
Scott: just being near one tower isn't good enough because all you can calculate is how far away from the one tower Am I?

431
00:32:20,043 --> 00:32:22,439
Scott: you don't know if you're knowing you even do that?

432
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:30,184
Scott: Yeah, cuz you know what the original signal like strength is and you get that how strong the one years where it is It gets a little.

433
00:32:30,204 --> 00:32:33,960
Scott: that's like if you shout at me and I'm like, oh well, it's the it's the inverse square law.

434
00:32:34,221 --> 00:32:41,393
Scott: So if you're sure I know if I know the original decibels of your shout And then I know that the shout that I heard was half that many decibels.

435
00:32:41,493 --> 00:32:43,420
Scott: I know that I'm this far away from you.

436
00:32:43,641 --> 00:32:44,871
Scott: I just don't know which direction.

437
00:32:44,911 --> 00:32:45,940
Scott: I am far away from you.

438
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,240
Rym: So basically what you're describing is kind of World War two era technology.

439
00:32:50,662 --> 00:33:02,299
Scott: Yeah, but if you have two towers like Lord of the Rings Then you can hear both towers and now suddenly you not only know how far away you are Exactly where you are.

440
00:33:02,621 --> 00:33:18,157
Rym: so I guess the gist of all this is the Battlestar Galactica problem and There is some real reason why some of these older radio navigation technologies might be re-enabled or rebuilt globally pretty much only for military

441
00:33:18,298 --> 00:33:18,419
Scott: use

442
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,074
Rym: Because like from this article

443
00:33:21,174 --> 00:33:22,220
Scott: you wouldn't use it in your phone.

444
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:22,661
Scott: Oh, yeah, these.

445
00:33:22,681 --> 00:33:24,587
Scott: so this kind of technology can't really be put in the phone.

446
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:32,500
Rym: The antenna is too big like this is like old big technology.

447
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:36,113
Rym: Okay, like be long like 90 to 110 kilohertz.

448
00:33:36,153 --> 00:33:38,080
Scott: You can put it in a boat or a plane just fine.

449
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:50,996
Rym: Yeah Yeah but this is an interesting problem and you could learn a lot about this like the use of old technology or redundant systems and radio navigation because It's relevant.

450
00:33:51,016 --> 00:33:58,600
Rym: nowadays North Korea has repeatedly blocked GPS along its border because that would be a highly effective way to make it difficult for say the u.s.

451
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:02,339
Rym: Or South Korea to target their installations if there were a sudden.

452
00:34:02,761 --> 00:34:09,312
Scott: I didn't realize their technology was good enough to block GPS blocking Signals or jamming them to the point that they're useless.

453
00:34:09,594 --> 00:34:13,871
Scott: pretty easy to do Mmm, I didn't think that they were like smart enough.

454
00:34:13,993 --> 00:34:15,600
Rym: Think about how easy it is to block Wi-Fi.

455
00:34:15,761 --> 00:34:17,858
Scott: Did they even have GPS in North Korea?

456
00:34:18,581 --> 00:34:20,199
Rym: Yeah, they can get GPS signals.

457
00:34:26,851 --> 00:34:29,243
Rym: but anyway things of the day.

458
00:34:29,283 --> 00:34:29,786
Rym: what do you got?

459
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:30,570
Scott: so?

460
00:34:31,512 --> 00:34:36,826
Scott: You know when you're rendering graphics, you know 3d computer graphics for video games, especially right.

461
00:34:37,206 --> 00:34:39,513
Scott: you have to render them in But it real time.

462
00:34:39,533 --> 00:34:53,138
Scott: so like if you're doing 60 FPS video game you need to render the full resolution of your screen 60 times every second in order to you know be decent right if you're rendering something like fucking a movie You don't have to do that shit.

463
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:54,704
Scott: You can like take all fucking day.

464
00:34:54,724 --> 00:34:56,290
Scott: You can render like a frame per day.

465
00:34:56,371 --> 00:34:57,860
Scott: I mean, you know, that's probably too slow.

466
00:34:57,921 --> 00:34:58,988
Scott: The movie will come out in 20 years.

467
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:02,850
Rym: Well go read about how long it took to render the original Toy Story, right?

468
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:06,270
Scott: It's like the Toy Story looks like crap now, but the computers were crap then right?

469
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:09,909
Scott: So it's like your computer could render Toy Story these days, but not those days.

470
00:35:10,371 --> 00:35:28,047
Scott: So, you know, you just let the thing render super long time and that's why computer graphics and movies a lot of them Especially the ones that are used for like just special effects in non completely computer generated movies like You know Like you CG to like show someone getting shot or something or who knows what and like it looks 100% real.

471
00:35:28,851 --> 00:35:29,132
Scott: Why?

472
00:35:29,213 --> 00:35:32,230
Scott: because they didn't have to render 60 frames in a single second.

473
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:36,566
Scott: They could render the 60 frames in like a few hours and spend all the time in the world rendering it.

474
00:35:36,707 --> 00:35:41,770
Scott: Absolutely perfectly Anyway, so there are different rendering methods, right?

475
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:48,022
Scott: So when you're use it when you're rendering for a video game You can't use certain methods of rendering because they're too slow.

476
00:35:48,504 --> 00:35:59,434
Scott: and one of the methods one of the most Simple basic and most like I've programmed raytraces before right is ray tracing and the way ray tracing works is you basically create You know a scene.

477
00:35:59,454 --> 00:36:06,520
Scott: you're like, oh, well, there's a cube here and there's a flat surface here And there's a big red ball over there and there's a person there.

478
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,785
Scott: over here you model the.

479
00:36:08,126 --> 00:36:13,964
Scott: you know The the physical space right and the reflective properties of each material.

480
00:36:14,486 --> 00:36:31,709
Scott: and then you create a light source And you basically shoot lines out from that light source and they bounce off all the surfaces and you're basically Simulating photons and then you simulate an eyeball somewhere and after shooting all these arrays everywhere you figure out which ones hit the

481
00:36:31,809 --> 00:36:32,030
Rym: eyeball.

482
00:36:33,231 --> 00:36:36,725
Rym: Right, you basically recalculate everything that could happen, right?

483
00:36:36,745 --> 00:36:49,378
Scott: Yeah, you're basically simulating effectively simulating all these rays of light to hit every part of the scene and You know hit the eyeball and then you whatever Something hits the eyeball, you know what color all the pixels on the screen are.

484
00:36:49,459 --> 00:36:51,588
Scott: and then now you can draw a picture of what it looks like.

485
00:36:51,649 --> 00:37:02,410
Scott: and if you Do this and if you shoot enough lines and do enough samples of each pixel It looks like super real and incredible assuming that your model is detailed enough, right?

486
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:06,450
Scott: I mean most of the models we did were like a cube in which case it looks like a cube.

487
00:37:06,712 --> 00:37:16,519
Scott: You could have just drawn a cube with like a pen but you know if you can get a really accurate model of like a person and you program in the reflective properties and the you Know the properties of the light source.

488
00:37:16,921 --> 00:37:18,109
Scott: It looks real basically.

489
00:37:18,129 --> 00:37:26,946
Scott: so You know, the dream has been to use ray tracing like a video game But doing that you can't render a whole screen 60 times a second.

490
00:37:27,146 --> 00:37:28,030
Scott: It just can't be done.

491
00:37:28,992 --> 00:37:32,881
Scott: but what if your game is really sort of not great looking?

492
00:37:33,462 --> 00:37:36,489
Scott: and what if you have a really brand new awesome supercomputer?

493
00:37:36,509 --> 00:37:41,219
Scott: and What if you lower the sampling rate so that it's kind of noisy looking?

494
00:37:41,921 --> 00:37:42,563
Scott: here you go.

495
00:37:42,583 --> 00:37:49,410
Scott: This is quake - a love story Quake - rendered with ray tracing in real time.

496
00:37:49,672 --> 00:37:57,006
Rym: The craziest thing is like you watch the whole video But toward the end like the shadows of these dudes walking around make it really apparent.

497
00:37:57,026 --> 00:37:58,190
Rym: What the hell's going on here.

498
00:37:58,372 --> 00:37:59,261
Scott: Oh, yeah, look at that.

499
00:37:59,463 --> 00:38:00,109
Rym: Oh my god.

500
00:38:00,357 --> 00:38:05,674
Scott: So yeah You can see it gets really noisy a lot because the sampling rate is so low And other parts.

501
00:38:05,694 --> 00:38:06,917
Scott: so they turn the sampling rate up.

502
00:38:06,957 --> 00:38:16,850
Scott: You can see the frame rate drop significantly and it's quake - so it doesn't look You know anything quick - it still looks like quake - though the models themselves are still blocky old models.

503
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:19,301
Rym: I played quake - in software only mode.

504
00:38:19,342 --> 00:38:21,130
Rym: my friend can at a voodoo card.

505
00:38:21,511 --> 00:38:24,543
Rym: Yeah, so he could actually use OpenGL to render on a video car.

506
00:38:24,563 --> 00:38:26,410
Scott: I had a TNT - I was using open here.

507
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:29,110
Rym: I got a creative graphics blaster extreme around that time.

508
00:38:29,251 --> 00:38:40,450
Scott: But the point is is like you can get an idea of when our you know Rendering technology gets even even better than it is now like something like maybe 10 years out when you've got the Nvidia.

509
00:38:43,052 --> 00:38:49,164
Scott: We can probably be applying this to like much better-looking game but at the same time reach the dream at the same time.

510
00:38:49,546 --> 00:38:56,688
Rym: look at how Barely, they can do it with an ancient game and modern computers are crazy powerful.

511
00:38:56,989 --> 00:39:00,861
Rym: Yep So this is a really simple thing of the day.

512
00:39:00,961 --> 00:39:03,070
Rym: I bumped into it and it was funnier than I expected.

513
00:39:04,312 --> 00:39:06,421
Rym: It's just these kids and they video themselves.

514
00:39:06,462 --> 00:39:07,084
Rym: It's from like 2013.

515
00:39:07,084 --> 00:39:08,149
Rym: It's kind of an old video.

516
00:39:08,892 --> 00:39:15,870
Rym: They just they picked ten laws of the things that are illegal to do in Britain and they just went and did.

517
00:39:16,411 --> 00:39:23,930
Rym: They specifically had to be things that are currently still illegal and that people have been cited for in recent memories.

518
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:31,210
Rym: So it can't be like thou shalt not walk a dog on the left side of a street Which is around on a Tuesday not like talking an elevator in New York.

519
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:39,769
Rym: Yeah, so they went and broke nine of these laws and video themselves doing it And it's just kind of funny.

520
00:39:40,331 --> 00:39:40,813
Rym: I think more.

521
00:39:40,893 --> 00:39:42,778
Rym: but the only one that they faked is.

522
00:39:42,859 --> 00:39:46,850
Rym: one of the laws was you can't shoot cannons in the city.

523
00:39:47,211 --> 00:39:51,487
Scott: Why don't I get a really tiny handheld cannon like pew firing a cannon within 300 yards of a house?

524
00:39:52,852 --> 00:39:53,576
Rym: So they were like.

525
00:39:53,878 --> 00:39:55,590
Rym: that's actually a really reasonable law.

526
00:39:56,112 --> 00:39:58,100
Rym: I don't think anyone should be able to fire a cannon within 300.

527
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:08,189
Scott: They could have just chosen a different law Yeah, but instead they made a little CG cannon on a hill and they're like, yeah I would have just done gotten a tiny real cannon and gun pew pew.

528
00:40:08,612 --> 00:40:10,522
Rym: I feel like the law might define what a cannon is.

529
00:40:10,562 --> 00:40:10,884
Rym: I don't know.

530
00:40:10,904 --> 00:40:11,929
Rym: I didn't delve too much into it.

531
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:18,669
Scott: I mean still a tiny tiny cannon that actually uses gunpowder and shoots a tiny ball and she shoot it into like You know a bucket or something.

532
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,890
Rym: I knew a guy when I worked at IBM who had one of those on his desk.

533
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:24,724
Rym: You could literally like put a tiny pellet into it and like put some flash powder into it.

534
00:40:24,864 --> 00:40:26,249
Rym: Yeah fire it you could do it.

535
00:40:26,651 --> 00:40:28,639
Scott: There's no limit on the smallness of a cannon.

536
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:36,185
Rym: as tiny as it was it was louder than you expected Oh, yeah, and it would shoot that tiny little ball like through really hard cardboard.

537
00:40:36,265 --> 00:40:37,630
Scott: It's still a fucking cannon ball.

538
00:40:37,791 --> 00:40:39,504
Rym: Yeah, it's basically just a tiny gun.

539
00:40:39,544 --> 00:40:44,369
Scott: Yes Gunpowder, you don't put gunpowder in non guns.

540
00:40:45,951 --> 00:40:50,130
Rym: So in the moment, uh, we mentioned this the other night and I'm gonna mention it again.

541
00:40:50,692 --> 00:40:57,901
Rym: If you ever tried to join the GeekNights forum, which is a pretty rockin forum It is at community dot front row career calm.

542
00:40:57,941 --> 00:40:59,810
Scott: do not go to forum dot front row career calm.

543
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:02,923
Scott: That is the old legacy forum that is locked for all eternity.

544
00:41:03,164 --> 00:41:04,630
Scott: It's frozen in time.

545
00:41:04,891 --> 00:41:10,530
Rym: It has that legacy forum has hundreds of thousands of posts and tens of thousands of topic.

546
00:41:10,571 --> 00:41:11,830
Scott: It is full of much content.

547
00:41:11,951 --> 00:41:16,470
Scott: But all the activity if you want to talk to people is on the new forum at community different recruit.

548
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:16,791
Scott: I calm.

549
00:41:16,831 --> 00:41:18,699
Scott: the old one is just an archive.

550
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:27,486
Rym: if you're watching this live stream like You should be in this forum because I feel like you've already gone like way beyond casual fan.

551
00:41:27,566 --> 00:41:28,369
Scott: all sad 14 people.

552
00:41:29,211 --> 00:41:39,830
Scott: Yeah, if you're if you're listening to this podcast in mp3 form and you're so sad that you're not I mean already pretty sad listening to GeekNights, but if you're so sad you want GeekNights in real time.

553
00:41:40,312 --> 00:41:42,078
Scott: It's on YouTube live now.

554
00:41:42,178 --> 00:41:43,623
Scott: most times we do it.

555
00:41:43,663 --> 00:41:49,937
Scott: Yep, if it's not around six ish Eastern time on the appropriate day.

556
00:41:49,957 --> 00:41:54,090
Rym: Yep, but if you want to talk about all this other people are four is pretty great.

557
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:57,369
Rym: But if you sign up for our forum, it asks you to prove you're human.

558
00:41:58,272 --> 00:42:07,858
Rym: You have to actually convince Scott or myself that you know who we are or some Somehow prove right that you're not about.

559
00:42:07,898 --> 00:42:14,150
Scott: someone wrote in that form field something like want to discuss video games And it's like that's not good enough, right?

560
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:15,393
Scott: Someone else wrote.

561
00:42:15,834 --> 00:42:18,641
Scott: what do you see and that means?

562
00:42:18,901 --> 00:42:21,087
Scott: Oh, that's that person definitely knows.

563
00:42:21,488 --> 00:42:27,566
Scott: Yeah, right You have to write something like just say like you're a listen like saying I'm a GeekNights listener.

564
00:42:27,607 --> 00:42:28,670
Scott: that enough that's enough.

565
00:42:28,851 --> 00:42:31,823
Rym: If you're like eight people gaga, not only you're approved.

566
00:42:31,863 --> 00:42:40,612
Scott: I'm probably gonna email you and be like, hey, right You need to write something in there that indicates to me that you're a human being and you are actually a listener of this Podcast.

567
00:42:40,672 --> 00:42:48,889
Scott: if you just write like want to discuss things or looking for a friend or fan of something That's gonna be like I want to argue about fruit.

568
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:51,095
Scott: Yeah, that's a big dick cuz.

569
00:42:51,155 --> 00:42:53,903
Rym: I further I'd got like 200 160 pose that would get you in for sure out of nowhere.

570
00:42:57,871 --> 00:42:59,659
Rym: Otherwise our book club book was doing.

571
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:00,161
Rym: we're done with it.

572
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:01,930
Rym: The next book is the fifth season.

573
00:43:02,352 --> 00:43:04,950
Scott: Yep, it looks pretty good by NK jemisin.

574
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:05,471
Scott: So it's.

575
00:43:05,552 --> 00:43:11,610
Scott: it's the hot fantasy sci-fi of the past, you know recent times much more recent than doing at least.

576
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:14,639
Scott: Yeah, even though I guess it's still a few years old probably.

577
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:16,284
Scott: but yeah, we're gonna get on that.

578
00:43:16,324 --> 00:43:17,448
Scott: biz get with the times.

579
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:20,682
Rym: and also In a few weeks is PAX West.

580
00:43:20,722 --> 00:43:21,506
Rym: We're gonna be there.

581
00:43:21,646 --> 00:43:24,039
Scott: Oh my god I just all my in.

582
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:33,096
Scott: I use Google inbox for my email and You know when I get emails like a convention, I'll just snooze them and then I'll be like, oh these are emails Like I bought plane tickets.

583
00:43:33,458 --> 00:43:35,370
Scott: I don't need to have these sitting in my inbox.

584
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:37,536
Scott: Yeah, go away come back.

585
00:43:37,617 --> 00:43:47,888
Rym: Like when the convention is soon all my PAX West emails reappeared this morning Yep, and that dread presence beyond the horizon mark for our eyes is in Seattle.

586
00:43:48,108 --> 00:43:51,276
Rym: Yeah And also that panel we're doing on quitting.

587
00:43:51,798 --> 00:43:58,118
Rym: it started as being basically just like a clone of our old quitting panel But it's actually way different now.

588
00:43:58,139 --> 00:43:58,640
Rym: Uh-huh.

589
00:43:58,721 --> 00:44:00,326
Scott: You say this every time and it's never true.

590
00:44:00,426 --> 00:44:01,510
Rym: Did you even look at the slides yet?

591
00:44:01,771 --> 00:44:03,423
Rym: No, it's basically a completely different panel.

592
00:44:03,504 --> 00:44:06,941
Scott: Uh-huh I'm gonna have to start making panels again.

593
00:44:06,981 --> 00:44:07,704
Scott: I just need an idea.

594
00:44:07,744 --> 00:44:08,648
Rym: Hey Dave, we take turns.

595
00:44:08,708 --> 00:44:09,130
Rym: you did a few.

596
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:12,870
Scott: I'm gonna make good panels that are actually a hundred percent original.

597
00:44:13,091 --> 00:44:15,890
Rym: This was the thing is it's more that we did our panel on quitting.

598
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:25,649
Rym: But we mostly talked about like all different kinds of quitting like people who quit before a game and during the game And why this one is only people who rage quit from ongoing games.

599
00:44:26,556 --> 00:44:34,626
Rym: So it's a very narrow and specific Focused panel based on things I learned from doing the panel before and I did some research - mm-hmm.

600
00:44:35,107 --> 00:44:36,595
Rym: I got some stuff in here Mm-hmm.

601
00:44:37,992 --> 00:44:43,151
Rym: Also, I got a really good animated gif that's relevant and an important headline Mm-hmm.

602
00:44:43,572 --> 00:45:00,203
Rym: from when all right a team called the RIT Tigers beat a team the Newman whatevers In a game of hockey 24 goals to zero and how that might have been mean and how.

603
00:45:00,704 --> 00:45:02,729
Rym: maybe they should have rage quit that game.

604
00:45:03,952 --> 00:45:05,969
Scott: It's almost we wanted our money's worth.

605
00:45:06,292 --> 00:45:13,309
Rym: It's noble of them that they didn't Much like the could the non men mansions that stood and bared there next to the men that came for them.

606
00:45:14,654 --> 00:45:17,114
Rym: I'm thinking our prince nothing a lot But yeah We're gonna be this packs.

607
00:45:17,676 --> 00:45:23,455
Rym: that is also relevant because a bunch of you have been bothering me mostly on the patreon About the utenna show.

608
00:45:23,475 --> 00:45:24,760
Rym: Yeah, it's coming back.

609
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:26,124
Rym: But wait until after packs.

610
00:45:26,185 --> 00:45:30,859
Rym: cuz I got a lot of shit to do before packs But it is coming back and I'm doing work on it.

611
00:45:31,561 --> 00:45:36,681
Rym: Yeah speaking of panels and public speaking We've never actually done a show on this.

612
00:45:36,821 --> 00:45:38,650
Scott: Are you sure I'm pretty confident?

613
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:40,173
Scott: I'm not a hundred percent sure.

614
00:45:40,274 --> 00:45:45,330
Rym: and also it's actually kind of changed a lot sure like just in the last few years.

615
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:49,009
Rym: I think it changed more than in like the 20 years before that.

616
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:56,410
Scott: But anyway, we want to talk about the AV equipment and setup for having a room in which public speaking is going to occur.

617
00:45:56,851 --> 00:45:57,071
Scott: So

618
00:45:57,432 --> 00:46:04,450
Rym: a presentation at a library or a panel at a convention or a lecture at a TED talk on a stage

619
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:18,690
Scott: Right, so there's a lot of stuff going on there and it's it's similar to like a lot of the stuff that you'll see for Like, you know if you're doing like stage stuff for like theater But it's a lot less because you don't need all the crazy lighting you just turn lights on so that you can see the person

620
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:26,174
Rym: But at the same time it's a lot more than most Organizers of things give the people who need it.

621
00:46:26,755 --> 00:46:36,947
Rym: and I feel like because one nerd conventions sort of Appropriated the word panel to mean literally anything that happens in a room on a stage when really

622
00:46:37,007 --> 00:46:37,910
Scott: things that aren't panels

623
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:47,389
Rym: Yeah, so but also nerd conventions are all work at least for a long time Especially if you don't get it like PAX is run by people who don't know shit about this stuff.

624
00:46:48,491 --> 00:47:02,510
Rym: So as a result a lot of people got used to very poor Technology being provided to them and have a very poor understanding of what is actually Really appropriate to give people who are doing a presentation of some kind in public, right?

625
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:09,630
Scott: So the number one thing obviously we're gonna start with the most important right is you need some Microphones and you need people to be able to hear what's coming out of the microphone, right?

626
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:16,210
Scott: Yep So at the highest end you're gonna have some kind of crazy things like we have which is like the country man Which is like a thing that goes over your ear.

627
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:21,370
Scott: These are the TED talk and it's a little tiny stick that comes out in the front of your face and it's totally wireless.

628
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:28,327
Scott: Yeah The wireless stuff is a big pain because it's different everywhere there that you go and it's way expensive.

629
00:47:28,447 --> 00:47:29,370
Scott: and it's way expensive.

630
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:32,884
Scott: So you don't buy this stuff you rent it unless you are a building.

631
00:47:32,904 --> 00:47:43,215
Scott: that like if you are a building And you're gonna have you know public speaking occurring in you like like let's say you are a college and you're have a you're building A theater in the college.

632
00:47:43,516 --> 00:47:46,389
Scott: you might just install a wireless thing that's gonna work in there.

633
00:47:46,771 --> 00:47:51,089
Scott: But if you're a person who goes around talking you don't buy that and bring it with you.

634
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:54,423
Scott: No, because you're gonna need a different thing every place you go.

635
00:47:54,483 --> 00:47:56,010
Rym: Yeah, we look I looked into it cuz way back.

636
00:47:56,030 --> 00:47:57,606
Rym: we're like, why don't we just buy wireless stuff?

637
00:47:57,627 --> 00:48:05,467
Rym: and A few listeners who you know work in a TV for a living emailed us and every one of them said don't buy it Do not buy it.

638
00:48:05,654 --> 00:48:06,275
Rym: Yes trap.

639
00:48:06,396 --> 00:48:14,895
Scott: and if you if you're like a Convention and you're renting out a building and the rooms don't have the stuff you need you rent it from someone to bring it To there and set up.

640
00:48:14,915 --> 00:48:16,382
Scott: who knows they're doing so.

641
00:48:16,984 --> 00:48:25,430
Rym: in terms of those microphones You pretty much definitely need one microphone per person who's going to be talking?

642
00:48:25,602 --> 00:48:35,110
Scott: Yeah a lot of times People have a whole bunch of people talking in the room and the room is being used by many many people at least a convention And there aren't enough microphones for everybody.

643
00:48:35,991 --> 00:48:49,974
Rym: Yeah, not having enough microphones to have one per person or Not having a like a system where there is not one per person And if you if you don't have one per person you have to have the wireless handheld kind so they can pass it to each Other.

644
00:48:49,994 --> 00:48:51,850
Rym: yeah, actually I found that that's almost worse.

645
00:48:52,257 --> 00:48:57,350
Scott: It's not great But it's still better than like everyone leaning in to these sticks that are on the table that don't move.

646
00:48:57,430 --> 00:49:07,189
Rym: I think it's worse because I've noticed just from years of experience Also like sitting in panel rooms at PAX being like a live streaming team if and even a ConnectiCon if it's all.

647
00:49:07,249 --> 00:49:08,814
Rym: if there's A wireless mic people are passing.

648
00:49:09,115 --> 00:49:18,622
Rym: whoever's holding it will be fucking with it when other people are talking and making noise with it Yeah, and they'll put it down All the time and they won't fucking pass it.

649
00:49:19,044 --> 00:49:20,550
Rym: Yeah, they just won't actually ever pass.

650
00:49:20,610 --> 00:49:24,450
Scott: It's also the kind of microphone that's basically a stick that comes up off the table.

651
00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:36,803
Scott: Yep this should only ever be used on a Turn when someone is standing at the lectern and talking like or if you're at a table like a commencement speech at a college or something you might be standing at a lectern and talking.

652
00:49:36,863 --> 00:49:40,209
Scott: or if you're the president at a press conference you're Standing there and talking at a lectern.

653
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:42,097
Scott: Well if otherwise do not use those.

654
00:49:42,157 --> 00:49:46,272
Scott: I seen a lot of places that will have a long table and they'll set up like four Of those.

655
00:49:46,574 --> 00:49:49,250
Scott: and yeah four people can sit at the table and talk.

656
00:49:49,631 --> 00:49:52,541
Scott: But it really sucks to do it that way and it doesn't.

657
00:49:52,582 --> 00:49:54,930
Scott: it forces those people to be stuck at the table.

658
00:49:55,251 --> 00:49:57,097
Scott: And if there's more than four people it sucks.

659
00:49:57,358 --> 00:50:01,030
Scott: and if someone else comes in doesn't use those it sucks cuz they're there.

660
00:50:01,433 --> 00:50:01,836
Scott: It's like it's.

661
00:50:01,877 --> 00:50:02,582
Scott: if they're just bad.

662
00:50:02,723 --> 00:50:06,198
Rym: only on lecterns I'll qualify that they are fine.

663
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:23,288
Rym: if the thing that is happening is actually a panel There are exactly the same number of people as they are those microphones who are forced to sit at them and they expect to sit And they are expected to sit which might seem crazy, but like we don't sit when we do presentations.

664
00:50:23,348 --> 00:50:23,950
Scott: This is true.

665
00:50:24,070 --> 00:50:27,990
Scott: However, I find that you know conventions at least are doing the stupid table thing.

666
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,863
Scott: Yeah, if you have a real panel like a good panel.

667
00:50:30,903 --> 00:50:41,186
Scott: you have chairs Then you don't have a table in front of the people and then the people have like lavalier You know microphones pinned on and that's how you make a classy looking panel.

668
00:50:41,226 --> 00:50:47,649
Scott: if it's actually a panel Yeah of you know of people all talking But you know in that you don't put a table in front of the people hiding them.

669
00:50:48,273 --> 00:50:50,949
Scott: Right you do the classy thing where there's just chairs.

670
00:50:51,793 --> 00:51:01,935
Rym: So it depends, but the point is and even in all those cases You you need to have a mixer and a system to manage those levels And you need someone.

671
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:06,210
Scott: some people are gonna be louder than other people even with the exact same microphone for everyone.

672
00:51:06,311 --> 00:51:08,724
Scott: Someone's one of them is gonna be louder for some reason.

673
00:51:08,824 --> 00:51:09,428
Scott: who knows what?

674
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:16,790
Scott: yeah Just the volumes and all the different inputs to make sure that everyone sounds the same loudness to the audience.

675
00:51:16,930 --> 00:51:20,381
Scott: If you don't have guy quieter make quiet whispery person louder.

676
00:51:20,481 --> 00:51:24,818
Rym: if you don't have independent control over all those microphones You're already gonna have a problem.

677
00:51:24,958 --> 00:51:27,210
Rym: Oh, yeah now the reality is at most nerdy conventions.

678
00:51:27,512 --> 00:51:30,669
Rym: It's awful and no one cares uh-huh, and they just deal with it.

679
00:51:31,272 --> 00:51:33,802
Scott: But that's not too much effort to get it exactly right.

680
00:51:33,922 --> 00:51:35,810
Rym: yep pecs gets it exactly right.

681
00:51:35,830 --> 00:51:38,467
Scott: I have a person in every room managing it all constantly.

682
00:51:38,588 --> 00:51:42,590
Scott: yep I mean I've done that job someone's job to only do that and nothing else.

683
00:51:42,791 --> 00:51:47,495
Rym: You know you're gonna like a concert like a fancy thing and you see that person You're sitting in from a giant mixer board.

684
00:51:47,957 --> 00:51:51,929
Rym: They're literally just like listening to all the audio and constantly fucking with everything.

685
00:51:51,949 --> 00:51:56,710
Scott: yeah The other thing you need to worry about is the is from the listening angle not the talking angle.

686
00:51:56,851 --> 00:51:58,629
Scott: Yeah is depending on the shape of the room.

687
00:51:59,011 --> 00:51:59,834
Scott: You know some.

688
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:06,388
Scott: some rooms have like built-in speakers in the ceiling and you can just use them right and they'll probably be fine If it's just talking going on.

689
00:52:06,731 --> 00:52:09,562
Scott: But if you have any kind of music or something those are probably gonna be really shitty.

690
00:52:09,823 --> 00:52:21,952
Scott: unless the room has a great sound system Built in so you got to bring your own speakers, and if the room is long It's a long room you need extra speakers in the back otherwise people in the back Can't hear.

691
00:52:22,053 --> 00:52:32,095
Rym: you cannot just put stacks at the front if the room is long because either It'll be way too loud to the people in the front or it'll be way too quiet for the people in the back you need To put a set.

692
00:52:32,276 --> 00:52:32,639
Scott: you know it.

693
00:52:32,981 --> 00:52:36,761
Scott: basically you put a set in the front And then maybe a set halfway down and another set.

694
00:52:36,781 --> 00:52:38,690
Scott: maybe even right the more the better.

695
00:52:38,771 --> 00:52:49,778
Scott: But two is usually enough for the longest rooms I've seen yeah, and that way even someone who's sitting farthest away from the front ones or even all the way in the back is Gonna be able to hear the speakers.

696
00:52:49,918 --> 00:52:50,560
Rym: now luckily.

697
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:52,366
Rym: This is not music.

698
00:52:52,447 --> 00:52:53,470
Rym: No one's performing.

699
00:52:53,530 --> 00:52:55,922
Rym: We're not talking about if you're if you're doing a musical set.

700
00:52:56,043 --> 00:52:57,470
Rym: This is a totally different ballgame.

701
00:52:57,571 --> 00:52:58,799
Rym: I don't know that that's like.

702
00:52:59,363 --> 00:53:00,309
Rym: that's a lot.

703
00:53:00,832 --> 00:53:08,310
Rym: But because it's people talking they don't need monitors meaning They don't need something feeding their own audio back to them.

704
00:53:08,430 --> 00:53:11,130
Scott: Yeah, they don't need to have monitors on the stage in front of them.

705
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:14,083
Scott: They don't have or a lot of people these use in-ear monitors.

706
00:53:14,103 --> 00:53:15,067
Rym: Yeah, you don't need any of that.

707
00:53:15,087 --> 00:53:15,750
Scott: You don't need those.

708
00:53:16,870 --> 00:53:19,522
Rym: Provided that I'd probably turn it down because it would just mess me up.

709
00:53:19,562 --> 00:53:21,390
Scott: if you're talking you don't need to hear yourself talk.

710
00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:25,095
Scott: But if you're singing you need to not only hear yourself sing But you all.

711
00:53:25,215 --> 00:53:28,250
Scott: you also need to hear the music so you can sing along to it properly.

712
00:53:28,732 --> 00:53:32,725
Scott: But you know the music coming out of speakers is too delayed for you.

713
00:53:32,846 --> 00:53:33,910
Scott: if you're on you know it's not good.

714
00:53:34,271 --> 00:53:44,510
Rym: Do not put the speakers Too close to the people who are on stage and especially do not put them behind the stage.

715
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:45,510
Scott: That's how you get the feedback.

716
00:53:49,015 --> 00:53:49,881
Rym: And the other thing you know.

717
00:53:49,921 --> 00:53:58,530
Scott: if anyone didn't know this already I think it's common sense, but just in case someone doesn't know the reason that a feedback happens is because it's feed back.

718
00:53:58,631 --> 00:53:58,995
Scott: You haven't.

719
00:53:59,299 --> 00:54:00,230
Scott: you have an amplifier.

720
00:54:00,411 --> 00:54:06,050
Scott: So you talk into the microphone and the sound that goes in the microphone gets louder and then comes out of the speaker, right?

721
00:54:06,556 --> 00:54:20,698
Scott: If it comes out of the speaker It's now louder than it started and that louder sound goes into the microphone again And it gets louder again And it gets goes back into the microphone in a loop and it keeps getting louder all the time And it can't get any louder.

722
00:54:20,718 --> 00:54:27,600
Scott: so the amplifier just maxes out and the maxed out sound is It really hurts everyone's ears because it's so ridiculously loud.

723
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:30,750
Scott: Yeah, so it's the amplifier amplifying itself over and over again.

724
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:34,988
Scott: So that's why you can't have the sound that comes out of the speakers go into the microphone.

725
00:54:35,269 --> 00:54:41,823
Rym: now There are clever ways to Catch or remove feedback from all live audio.

726
00:54:41,883 --> 00:54:43,549
Scott: However, you are not using those.

727
00:54:43,609 --> 00:54:57,090
Scott: Yes No as much as those systems exist for the vast majority of public speaking even like kind of the bigger stuff we do even a big Fancy professional concert places someone will still mess up and there can be feedback because they don't use that shit.

728
00:54:57,411 --> 00:54:58,254
Rym: Yeah, I mean yet.

729
00:54:58,355 --> 00:55:02,210
Rym: I mean this mixer actually I have that I can integrate into those kind of systems.

730
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:14,750
Rym: I have ways to do that live but there are consequences and those systems are complicated and Unless you have dedicated professional staff running everything you do not want to use complicated systems.

731
00:55:15,192 --> 00:55:16,620
Rym: No, because they are complicated.

732
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,250
Scott: All right, so that's that's the audio situation.

733
00:55:18,493 --> 00:55:29,746
Rym: There's a couple more pieces of the audio Because people talking a lot of hearing will want to play videos and they need the audio from those videos to go into the system.

734
00:55:30,589 --> 00:55:36,990
Rym: and Most organizations most conventions have no way to accomplish this.

735
00:55:37,933 --> 00:55:39,981
Scott: So people are gonna be playing video.

736
00:55:40,061 --> 00:55:44,589
Scott: if they're playing video from like, you know a DVD or something You're just getting you know, no one's bringing their own player.

737
00:55:44,911 --> 00:55:45,112
Scott: It's like.

738
00:55:45,152 --> 00:55:49,030
Scott: you need to set up just players and stuff in advance if people are gonna use them, right?

739
00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:50,433
Scott: Yeah, which you could just set them up.

740
00:55:50,473 --> 00:55:50,895
Scott: You're good.

741
00:55:51,276 --> 00:56:00,030
Scott: But if people are bringing laptops, right laptops are either a Going to have a regular headphone jack of some kind, right?

742
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:11,870
Scott: and if they have that you need to have basically a special box that takes in headphone input and Outputs into the mixer and usually has power and some kind of amplifier or something, right?

743
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:13,314
Scott: They sell these boxes that do this.

744
00:56:13,696 --> 00:56:22,667
Scott: you need those boxes because you can't just run a cable from someone's phone Into the mixer but Rym and Scott that XLR cable is like a hundred feet long.

745
00:56:22,727 --> 00:56:23,450
Rym: Why is it different?

746
00:56:23,490 --> 00:56:24,495
Rym: The answer is they're different.

747
00:56:24,515 --> 00:56:25,921
Rym: they work differently it does.

748
00:56:25,961 --> 00:56:27,186
Scott: you can't do that, right?

749
00:56:27,327 --> 00:56:28,050
Scott: It doesn't work that way.

750
00:56:28,070 --> 00:56:28,959
Scott: You need to buy these boxes.

751
00:56:28,979 --> 00:56:29,868
Scott: You need to have them right?

752
00:56:30,210 --> 00:56:30,914
Scott: Yep other.

753
00:56:31,155 --> 00:56:41,209
Scott: however today I was gonna talk about this in the video section but some people a lot of people now are using HDMI and HDMI can not only carries video but can carry audio.

754
00:56:42,011 --> 00:56:53,170
Scott: So if you are taking HDMI from people's, you know laptops or devices Which you very may well be you need to be able to handle the audio that's coming over that HDMI.

755
00:56:53,371 --> 00:56:57,610
Scott: You can get it out of there and send it to your mixer while without messing with the video part.

756
00:56:58,234 --> 00:57:00,629
Scott: You can do this and if you can do it, you should do it.

757
00:57:00,730 --> 00:57:10,570
Scott: So the funny thing a lot of it is someone will not do this and the audio will go into the projector And a lot of projectors will have speakers built into them crappy ones.

758
00:57:10,610 --> 00:57:14,930
Scott: You'll hear audio coming out of the projector and it's not going to the audio system.

759
00:57:15,091 --> 00:57:20,510
Scott: If this is the case, you can actually solve this by taking an audio out cable from the projector and putting into the mixer.

760
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:22,638
Scott: Yep, right, but people don't do that.

761
00:57:22,678 --> 00:57:25,990
Scott: So it's like this tiny crappy speaker in the projector is making noise.

762
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:27,937
Scott: Everyone's like what is going on?

763
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:29,642
Scott: How come I can't hear the video.

764
00:57:29,743 --> 00:57:31,930
Scott: It's like I can hear it, but it sounds so distant.

765
00:57:31,991 --> 00:57:33,382
Scott: How come it's not coming out of the speaker?

766
00:57:33,604 --> 00:57:36,873
Scott: That's why Don't let that happen.

767
00:57:37,335 --> 00:57:42,670
Rym: as a side note what I see most commonly that happens is people who present and this is like a separate problem.

768
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:51,924
Rym: We're not gonna get into people who don't know how to tell their laptop to send the audio out Speaker hole versus the HDMI have no idea how their own laptop works.

769
00:57:52,125 --> 00:57:53,027
Scott: Yeah at all.

770
00:57:53,128 --> 00:57:53,368
Scott: Nope.

771
00:57:53,809 --> 00:57:54,492
Scott: Nope They don't know.

772
00:57:54,793 --> 00:58:02,422
Rym: so you're gonna have to have someone in that room who knows how laptops work in a general sense But I digress in terms of video.

773
00:58:02,664 --> 00:58:19,070
Rym: the conventional wisdom conventional gig inventions that Has existed until I'd say about two years ago this started to change is that you should assume that everyone will have VGA And if you present anywhere you should assume that they will take VGA and pretty much every convention will say have VGA.

774
00:58:19,994 --> 00:58:21,482
Rym: I have found just in the last couple years.

775
00:58:21,925 --> 00:58:22,910
Rym: That is no longer the case.

776
00:58:23,010 --> 00:58:31,934
Rym: I've been to conventions where they do not have VGA for me to plug into and I there's so many people who have laptops that Cannot output VGA

777
00:58:32,055 --> 00:58:40,050
Scott: in newer laptops and newer devices only have HDMI or just mini DisplayPort or DisplayPort outputs and do not have VGA output

778
00:58:41,033 --> 00:58:42,642
Rym: Only have HDMI input.

779
00:58:42,703 --> 00:58:52,310
Scott: and also it's an Places you go to based on how new they are or how recently they've been updated And what their projector is is gonna have VGA or HDMI.

780
00:58:52,491 --> 00:58:59,104
Scott: So if you're going to do lectures at places or whatever you bring every goddamn adapt You need to be able to output either one.

781
00:58:59,144 --> 00:59:05,841
Scott: you make sure it works And if you're setting up the tech in the room You need to be able to accept either one of those two.

782
00:59:05,902 --> 00:59:08,170
Scott: VGA and HDMI are the only ones you need to support.

783
00:59:08,631 --> 00:59:12,839
Scott: you might need mini DisplayPort is also good to have in case someone doesn't have the adapter for that.

784
00:59:12,859 --> 00:59:16,329
Scott: and You know, you need to be able to handle all of those.

785
00:59:16,993 --> 00:59:19,445
Scott: We can't just force people into use one anymore.

786
00:59:19,485 --> 00:59:20,410
Scott: You got to have the full set.

787
00:59:20,591 --> 00:59:25,067
Rym: Yep, and this this is a break from the advice we've given for a decade because it's different now.

788
00:59:25,087 --> 00:59:25,488
Rym: Mm-hmm.

789
00:59:26,091 --> 00:59:31,314
Rym: so along those lines there is resolution and Aspect ratio.

790
00:59:31,334 --> 00:59:31,595
Scott: right.

791
00:59:31,635 --> 00:59:46,977
Scott: so presentation older projectors are gonna be a four-thirds aspect ratio Which is like an old square TV, but newer ones are gonna be 16 9 and the problem is if you're making You know slides for your lecture or whatever Do you make them 16 9?

792
00:59:46,977 --> 00:59:48,022
Scott: do you make them 4 3?

793
00:59:48,022 --> 00:59:51,076
Scott: and the answer is you make both which is a pain Yeah, so I don't anymore.

794
00:59:51,096 --> 00:59:53,750
Scott: or at least make sure they look good on either shape screen.

795
00:59:54,051 --> 00:59:59,150
Scott: Yeah, and make sure you know how to make your laptop display it without stretching and distorting it on any shape screen.

796
00:59:59,230 --> 01:00:05,090
Rym: So the problem was in the old days if you outputted 16 9 or 16 10 from your laptop the projector was shitty.

797
01:00:05,170 --> 01:00:06,598
Rym: Oh, just squish it make it look awful.

798
01:00:06,618 --> 01:00:19,349
Rym: So you pretty much had to make everything 4 by 3 and Do your own letterboxing or whatever if you want it to be look different, but nowadays usually the projectors I'll take a lot of different aspect ratios just fine and kind of deal with it.

799
01:00:19,851 --> 01:00:26,290
Rym: But conventions or people are running the event will often just fuck up the projectors configuration.

800
01:00:27,517 --> 01:00:29,715
Rym: so Two or three years ago.

801
01:00:29,775 --> 01:00:33,210
Rym: I pretty much would always say do 4 by 3 because that's the safest.

802
01:00:34,132 --> 01:00:35,223
Rym: But I we switch.

803
01:00:35,263 --> 01:00:40,690
Rym: cuz my tool was like Why don't you guys switch and he goes to way more events than we do and he does AV like for like he knows the shit.

804
01:00:41,273 --> 01:00:49,571
Rym: so we took him up on it and we switch and We got burned by it at one packs, but it really looked good at like two other packs Is?

805
01:00:50,174 --> 01:00:53,710
Rym: I feel like it works out more often than it burns us.

806
01:00:53,770 --> 01:00:59,290
Rym: So I've switched to 16 by 9 now for our panels, but I never put important information on the edge.

807
01:00:59,773 --> 01:01:01,890
Rym: So if it gets squished, it'll be okay.

808
01:01:02,171 --> 01:01:07,010
Scott: The point is if you're running the room you want to make sure you know, you can't have two projectors, right?

809
01:01:07,090 --> 01:01:07,593
Scott: That's ridiculous.

810
01:01:07,613 --> 01:01:10,930
Rym: You just need to have a modern projector that can do both fine.

811
01:01:10,990 --> 01:01:12,419
Rym: You need someone who knows how to configure.

812
01:01:12,439 --> 01:01:17,662
Scott: you need to be able to support though Right either one and have it show up if it's letterbox.

813
01:01:17,703 --> 01:01:19,208
Scott: It's not a big deal, right?

814
01:01:19,248 --> 01:01:21,938
Scott: It's like, okay We're using less of the screen, but I don't care right?

815
01:01:21,998 --> 01:01:26,755
Scott: It's it's showing right and so you can tell the person why it's Looking that way.

816
01:01:26,775 --> 01:01:28,141
Rym: Yeah, so here's the real moral.

817
01:01:28,182 --> 01:01:29,930
Scott: I think it just has to show up on the screen.

818
01:01:30,010 --> 01:01:30,754
Scott: Some people can read it.

819
01:01:31,256 --> 01:01:37,356
Rym: Generally if you're doing an event like once or twice a year Probably shouldn't own a projector.

820
01:01:37,637 --> 01:01:42,797
Rym: No, you should probably just rent them every year because they change Yeah, and they get they.

821
01:01:42,857 --> 01:01:43,179
Rym: also.

822
01:01:43,219 --> 01:01:45,530
Scott: if you own a projector you got to deal with shit like bulbs.

823
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:47,617
Scott: Yeah, kind of the nonsense.

824
01:01:47,657 --> 01:01:48,199
Scott: you'd rent them.

825
01:01:48,219 --> 01:01:49,043
Scott: They'll always be perfect.

826
01:01:49,143 --> 01:01:50,670
Rym: Yeah, it's kind of like with the wireless systems.

827
01:01:51,111 --> 01:02:00,108
Rym: owning it will cost you more in the long term term than just renting it unless you Like run events as a job right and you use the projector.

828
01:02:00,148 --> 01:02:02,096
Scott: the same About the wireless stuff.

829
01:02:02,116 --> 01:02:08,519
Scott: The only time you should be buying this sort of equipment is If you own a space.

830
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:10,950
Scott: you own a theater you own an auditorium.

831
01:02:11,292 --> 01:02:13,890
Scott: You need to put technology in the auditorium permanently.

832
01:02:14,433 --> 01:02:17,350
Scott: The other time you would own it is if you are a company that rents it out.

833
01:02:17,490 --> 01:02:23,509
Scott: Otherwise do not own any of this stuff because you will not use it enough even if you use it every day.

834
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:27,674
Scott: Right, if you're traveling and you're the speaker person It's it.

835
01:02:27,715 --> 01:02:28,740
Scott: what's the point you're getting?

836
01:02:28,821 --> 01:02:30,570
Scott: every place you go is gonna have stuff for you.

837
01:02:30,610 --> 01:02:31,540
Scott: Why are you owning this?

838
01:02:31,580 --> 01:02:32,085
Scott: for no reason?

839
01:02:32,287 --> 01:02:41,185
Scott: Yep The only thing we own is microphones that can be plugged in anywhere because a lot of places Only give us the handheld kind or the shitty kind but it's we.

840
01:02:41,326 --> 01:02:42,450
Scott: everything else is up to them.

841
01:02:42,530 --> 01:02:49,767
Scott: We're just gonna plug into their stuff and obviously if we can't because their system is crappy Well, just use whatever microphones they give us and deal with it.

842
01:02:49,928 --> 01:02:54,804
Rym: Yep So this is a very important thing that most the conventions especially just don't.

843
01:02:54,844 --> 01:02:58,969
Rym: do you need to have monitors multiple if possible.

844
01:02:59,553 --> 01:03:02,910
Scott: You don't need this but it's extremely extremely helpful and recommend.

845
01:03:02,991 --> 01:03:13,970
Rym: Well, so here's that for a small event You only don't need it because usually the person who's presenting has a laptop in front of them anyway Mm-hmm, but in a more professional setting the laptop won't actually be in front of them.

846
01:03:14,178 --> 01:03:19,329
Scott: Yeah Their laptop is gonna be like wherever the wires are and they might not be near where that is.

847
01:03:19,691 --> 01:03:20,554
Rym: So you need.

848
01:03:20,574 --> 01:03:24,890
Scott: so now they can't see what slide they're on without turning around and looking back at the big screen.

849
01:03:25,016 --> 01:03:32,933
Rym: Yep So you need screens showing them what they are showing the audience and ideally you want those to be like down on the floor by The audience.

850
01:03:33,175 --> 01:03:35,790
Rym: so you're looking at the audience when you're looking at them, right?

851
01:03:35,910 --> 01:03:46,730
Scott: So normally where the audio monitors would be right because you don't have those because it's their own singing you put video monitors Actual monitors that show what's on the big screen to the person who's on the stage.

852
01:03:47,173 --> 01:03:51,277
Scott: So now they can see what's going on Right and they know what slide they're on.

853
01:03:51,558 --> 01:03:54,490
Scott: but they're still facing forward to our the audience the whole time and it's awesome.

854
01:03:54,791 --> 01:04:05,330
Scott: So in the old days where we couldn't rely on that at all and when laptops like my oldest laptop couldn't display I mean even panels that have that you'll see I'll be looking at the big screen or the laptop a lot.

855
01:04:05,390 --> 01:04:08,445
Scott: But when the panels do have it, I still use it plenty.

856
01:04:08,465 --> 01:04:08,847
Scott: It's great.

857
01:04:09,028 --> 01:04:23,623
Rym: Yep Like I our panels I could not do them the way that we do them without that because we you know we do like 80 slides in an hour because we make slide transitions like as Beats in the talk meaning I really need to reflect.

858
01:04:23,683 --> 01:04:29,344
Rym: see if I double-click by accident And I don't have something to look at the panel is gonna literally be off forever.

859
01:04:29,625 --> 01:04:32,432
Rym: Mm-hmm a Concurrent to that.

860
01:04:32,753 --> 01:04:35,982
Rym: you need to have countdown timers in the room.

861
01:04:36,002 --> 01:04:39,110
Scott: Those are also not guaranteed absolutely necessary.

862
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:42,270
Rym: Yeah, I don't trust they'll be there and I are extremely helpful.

863
01:04:42,451 --> 01:04:44,700
Rym: My clicker has won my watch has won.

864
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:47,250
Rym: Scott's watch has won like I'm paranoid about it.

865
01:04:47,531 --> 01:04:57,990
Rym: But if you run an event and you care about technology and like having things go the countdown timer has to be there Has to be accurate assuming that the person has a limited time for their talk, which almost always is the case.

866
01:04:57,990 --> 01:05:00,079
Scott: Yes, so that way the person knows.

867
01:05:00,099 --> 01:05:02,590
Scott: Oh my I'm almost out of time, right?

868
01:05:02,830 --> 01:05:06,210
Scott: Um, you know, they can see I had to pace themselves if you don't have a clock there.

869
01:05:06,471 --> 01:05:08,684
Scott: That's big and prominent and in their field of view.

870
01:05:08,724 --> 01:05:18,790
Scott: all the time though Everyone who talks you no matter how pro there will lose track of time Yep, and either run long or run short and more importantly professionals like are used to that.

871
01:05:18,911 --> 01:05:24,419
Rym: Like if that's not there It's really hard for me because I am deeply.

872
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:25,161
Rym: it's like I like.

873
01:05:25,261 --> 01:05:32,415
Rym: it's instinctual to use that and I time myself very specifically Along those lines too.

874
01:05:33,077 --> 01:05:41,690
Rym: You need to have ways to cut off audio and kick people out And technologically you should be able to cut off their mics.

875
01:05:42,370 --> 01:05:43,796
Rym: Cuz shit might go down.

876
01:05:43,956 --> 01:05:44,378
Scott: That's right.

877
01:05:44,418 --> 01:05:49,405
Scott: If you just have people in there and you can't turn the microphones off Yeah, baba booey baba booey might happen.

878
01:05:49,425 --> 01:05:50,572
Scott: Mm-hmm You need.

879
01:05:50,652 --> 01:05:58,830
Scott: that's why you want the tech person sitting there at the mixer and if that person starts spouting profanities You can just mute them and then call security.

880
01:05:59,111 --> 01:06:08,890
Scott: Yep, and you don't have them continuing to spout profanities very loudly because you can't take the microphone away from them But you can still turn off the microphone remotely and they can't come over and mess with the mixer.

881
01:06:09,913 --> 01:06:10,759
Scott: They wouldn't even know what to do.

882
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:18,586
Rym: Probably anyway, yep so Anything else that you could learn about this technology is basically like they're all actually just skills.

883
01:06:18,606 --> 01:06:20,898
Rym: that like anyone who's ever been a roadie For a band.

884
01:06:20,918 --> 01:06:27,190
Scott: Yeah, or like everybody's Worry about so much more difficult shit like audio monitoring lighting that changes the light.

885
01:06:27,230 --> 01:06:30,550
Scott: I mean lighting is important, but it doesn't change while the person is talking.

886
01:06:30,670 --> 01:06:32,155
Scott: Maybe you didn't?

887
01:06:32,195 --> 01:06:38,786
Scott: you turn up more lights when they're done and dim them a little bit when they start or maybe you do a Spotlight thing and a Ted but you don't.

888
01:06:38,968 --> 01:06:39,612
Rym: yeah It's not.

889
01:06:39,652 --> 01:06:43,250
Scott: it's not lighting that changes with scenes or different songs or anything.

890
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:45,481
Scott: It's one lighting dirt for the whole thing the end.

891
01:06:45,662 --> 01:06:49,482
Rym: so in a panel or presentation though You do have to balance the three.

892
01:06:49,523 --> 01:06:50,810
Rym: there's three areas to worry about.

893
01:06:50,830 --> 01:06:53,340
Rym: This is like a crash course in lighting 101 for your kids.

894
01:06:53,681 --> 01:06:57,313
Rym: There's the house lights stage lights Projection.

895
01:06:57,474 --> 01:06:59,370
Rym: those three things have to be in balance.

896
01:06:59,772 --> 01:07:05,288
Rym: You gently the house lights are not that important and you if you can it's better to dim them to put the focus on the people in front of the room.

897
01:07:06,311 --> 01:07:08,821
Rym: You don't want them to be out because then people can't take notes.

898
01:07:08,861 --> 01:07:11,190
Scott: It's not a dark movie situation, right?

899
01:07:11,670 --> 01:07:12,414
Scott: Oh, you need to.

900
01:07:12,474 --> 01:07:15,770
Scott: you want people to be able to see where they're walking to see their neighbors, right?

901
01:07:15,930 --> 01:07:16,191
Scott: There's.

902
01:07:16,211 --> 01:07:21,530
Rym: ideally you want the stage to be bright but to in to not splash onto the projection.

903
01:07:22,192 --> 01:07:28,970
Rym: But the reality is most spaces that panels are in that's impossible like a ConnectiCon the lowest light setting.

904
01:07:29,051 --> 01:07:31,890
Rym: That's not off has lights like on the screen.

905
01:07:31,990 --> 01:07:35,910
Scott: You need the projection itself to be bright enough that everyone in the room can see it clearly.

906
01:07:35,970 --> 01:07:40,770
Scott: You might need more than one screen even right, you know have two projectors showing the same thing, right?

907
01:07:40,970 --> 01:07:44,010
Scott: That way, you know you people on the left and people on the right can see it.

908
01:07:44,030 --> 01:07:45,509
Scott: It's good and really wide rooms.

909
01:07:45,610 --> 01:07:50,090
Scott: Yeah There's people sitting on the way right side of the room with the projectors in the way left can't see anything.

910
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:52,300
Scott: So you want two projectors one on the right one on the left.

911
01:07:52,642 --> 01:07:54,370
Scott: You'll see this a lot like big arenas.

912
01:07:54,450 --> 01:07:58,990
Scott: They'll have like screens on the left and right side of the stage showing, you know, it's the same idea.

913
01:07:59,271 --> 01:08:03,204
Rym: But but generally the important thing is usually you'll have to compromise like usually.

914
01:08:03,525 --> 01:08:08,285
Rym: just the way these things are set up You won't be able to have the screen be in a dark area.

915
01:08:08,305 --> 01:08:11,289
Rym: So it's easy to see and Brightly light the front of the room.

916
01:08:11,832 --> 01:08:26,200
Rym: so if you have to choose between the two you have to always you have to be able to make a spot judgment between Are the people presenting primarily the slides or whatever is on the screen or are they themselves the Presentation and light the appropriate one?

917
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:27,444
Rym: and that's it another.

918
01:08:27,464 --> 01:08:29,250
Scott: there are also some advanced techniques All right.

919
01:08:29,250 --> 01:08:30,562
Scott: So first advanced technique.

920
01:08:30,944 --> 01:08:38,399
Scott: and you know Usually you won't do this if you won't have to know to do this because you're paying someone to do this for you And they just do it.

921
01:08:38,459 --> 01:08:40,330
Scott: but the double up projector, right?

922
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:41,676
Scott: You know take more.

923
01:08:41,716 --> 01:08:53,410
Scott: you could take multiple projectors and as long as they're identical Projectors and you put them in like this brace you put them together Physically one on top of the other right stacked and then they project the exact same image.

924
01:08:53,531 --> 01:08:57,149
Scott: But you aim the top one a little bit down and aim the bottom one a little bit up.

925
01:08:57,491 --> 01:09:02,050
Scott: So they're projecting the exact same thing to the exact same spot.

926
01:09:02,533 --> 01:09:05,609
Scott: So basically you're really just doubling the bulb power.

927
01:09:06,171 --> 01:09:12,510
Scott: So this is how you can get a ridiculously bright projection, you know, because you can't get a brighter bulb You can't get a better projector.

928
01:09:12,609 --> 01:09:21,064
Scott: just get more projectors and aim them all at the exact same spot for super precisely lined up and you'll get this Ridiculously bright image bouncing off the wall.

929
01:09:21,145 --> 01:09:27,666
Scott: and bonus point Even if the room is really bright that Projected image will be so much brighter that you'll be able to see it no matter what.

930
01:09:27,746 --> 01:09:30,479
Rym: but bonus points now You're ever done and see if a projector dies.

931
01:09:30,499 --> 01:09:34,336
Scott: Yeah, if a projector dies, okay Well, it's kind of dim now.

932
01:09:34,395 --> 01:09:42,330
Scott: It's half as bright, but you can just turn the brightness up all the way on the remaining one and You still have an image there even though a bulb blew out.

933
01:09:42,450 --> 01:09:51,585
Rym: This is also why you rent this technology because if you rent projectors from good places You can say give me double projectors and they'll just do it rather than you having to own.

934
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:53,050
Scott: you might even have to ask for it.

935
01:09:53,069 --> 01:09:53,752
Scott: They'll just know.

936
01:09:53,773 --> 01:10:01,478
Scott: you just say I need projection in this room on both sides of this stage and they say oh Well, this room is big and we're not gonna be able to turn the house lights off We're gonna need double projectors in here.

937
01:10:01,498 --> 01:10:02,444
Scott: They don't even tell you they're doing.

938
01:10:02,465 --> 01:10:02,968
Scott: they just do it.

939
01:10:03,431 --> 01:10:05,488
Scott: Yeah, right because you don't need to know details like that.

940
01:10:06,051 --> 01:10:07,134
Rym: So little subtle things.

941
01:10:07,515 --> 01:10:26,510
Rym: if you have wireless microphones or microphones in a crowd or anything either physically like put them in a stand that can't be rotated or Do something to ensure like if you have to like talk to the people who are presenting To make sure that they never walk out in front of a mile they speaker holding a microphone.

942
01:10:26,911 --> 01:10:31,025
Scott: Yeah, another thing with the wireless microphones if you're providing them is the batteries.

943
01:10:31,085 --> 01:10:32,710
Rym: the batteries are just gonna die constantly.

944
01:10:33,216 --> 01:10:47,883
Scott: Use up so much battery You don't even realize you need to bring with you a crap ton of the appropriate batteries Especially how long this event is going to run and you want to check them In between every single time anyone uses them constantly.

945
01:10:47,983 --> 01:10:52,302
Scott: Yep, right, you know, even if it's like, okay That person only used one of the three bars.

946
01:10:52,322 --> 01:10:53,710
Scott: We can just leave this battery alone.

947
01:10:54,293 --> 01:10:56,850
Scott: But you cannot have the battery die while someone's up there.

948
01:10:56,971 --> 01:11:02,706
Scott: So if it's down to one bar Even if it might even it can probably make it to the end of the next talk or whatever.

949
01:11:03,027 --> 01:11:03,750
Scott: replace that shit.

950
01:11:03,991 --> 01:11:06,070
Scott: Yes, it cannot go out mid talk.

951
01:11:06,271 --> 01:11:09,663
Scott: It cannot happen and the microphones are not made in such a way.

952
01:11:09,703 --> 01:11:11,349
Scott: where they have like redundant batteries in them.

953
01:11:12,555 --> 01:11:14,549
Scott: It's just when that battery dies they die.

954
01:11:15,192 --> 01:11:28,295
Scott: So make sure that it's definitely guaranteed to have enough power to last the length of the talk That is about to happen plus a nice buffer before you know, you allow that battery to be used Otherwise new one.

955
01:11:28,778 --> 01:11:29,482
Rym: I guess the last thing.

956
01:11:29,502 --> 01:11:32,010
Rym: and like roadies and like AV people This is like babies first.

957
01:11:32,131 --> 01:11:38,829
Rym: But like say you're actually setting up a room like this Even if it's like a really simple event and you think it's easy and you've got it.

958
01:11:39,311 --> 01:11:48,968
Rym: There's some basic you need to like label all the cables make to make a little diagram even if you draw it crappily of like where all the microphones are on the stage and put it next to your mixer.

959
01:11:48,988 --> 01:11:50,655
Rym: and Label which ones which?

960
01:11:50,976 --> 01:11:57,244
Rym: because if something goes wrong and someone's way too loud or way too quiet You see it's like oh god Rym's being too loud Rym's.

961
01:11:57,304 --> 01:11:59,588
Scott: microphone to three Yep - all right.

962
01:12:00,855 --> 01:12:04,790
Scott: And then you turn Scott down by accident while he's hot while Scott's talking you turn him down.

963
01:12:04,810 --> 01:12:17,410
Rym: It's like oops label all your cables on both ends and maybe once in the middle like Organize all the cables effectively like all this basic stuff that it's hard to sort of explain what to do without spending an hour.

964
01:12:17,531 --> 01:12:20,110
Rym: So just go read like a roadie blog or something.

965
01:12:20,672 --> 01:12:21,354
Rym: It's not hard.

966
01:12:21,675 --> 01:12:28,175
Rym: but do more preparation and more labeling than you think is Necessary or even reasonable.

967
01:12:28,195 --> 01:12:31,889
Rym: it couldn't hurt like whatever you think you is a reasonable amount of labeling double it.

968
01:12:32,070 --> 01:12:33,659
Scott: Yeah, it's it's very hard.

969
01:12:33,699 --> 01:12:35,690
Scott: It does not a lot of things you can do that would hurt.

970
01:12:35,830 --> 01:12:37,255
Scott: It's just things you can forget to do.

971
01:12:37,296 --> 01:12:37,717
Scott: that would hurt.

972
01:12:37,757 --> 01:12:48,641
Scott: Yeah, so putting in more effort might be wasted effort But you can't really make things bad by trying harder like run a couple extra XLR cables Even if you don't have that many microphones.

973
01:12:48,742 --> 01:12:54,886
Rym: that might save your ass Mm-hmm, if you have like if you have an extra laptop that you just keep that's there.

974
01:12:54,927 --> 01:12:58,600
Rym: in case like the laptop They're using dies like they shouldn't expect that.

975
01:12:58,921 --> 01:13:00,648
Rym: but that's the kind of thing that'll save your event.

976
01:13:00,949 --> 01:13:01,473
Scott: Mm-hmm Just

977
01:13:01,715 --> 01:13:10,027
Rym: plan for every eventuality Put extra redundant technology in and frankly rent almost all of the actual physical equipment and you're getting

978
01:13:10,087 --> 01:13:12,455
Scott: including staff to manage yeah, and

979
01:13:12,515 --> 01:13:23,207
Rym: have at least one person who either does this professionally or Actually knows what they're doing and actually actually knows Mm-hmm, and I'm just really hungry.

980
01:13:23,227 --> 01:13:23,489
Rym: So I'm so.

981
01:13:30,274 --> 01:13:32,810
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

982
01:13:32,870 --> 01:13:37,610
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

983
01:13:37,931 --> 01:13:39,898
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at front row.

984
01:13:39,938 --> 01:13:42,930
Scott: crew calm for show notes discussion news and more.

985
01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:50,610
Rym: Remember GeekNights is not one but four different shows sci-tech Mondays gaming Tuesdays anime comic Wednesdays and indiscriminate Thursdays.
