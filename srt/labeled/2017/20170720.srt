00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,509
Rym: It's Thursday July 20th 2017.

2
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:12,211
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,391 --> 00:00:18,671
Rym: I'm scared and tonight on the GeekNights book club We're talking about dune by Frank Herbert.

4
00:00:19,273 --> 00:00:20,236
Rym: just the first book.

5
00:00:20,296 --> 00:00:20,637
Rym: none of that.

6
00:00:20,658 --> 00:00:21,340
Rym: other nonsense.

7
00:00:22,601 --> 00:00:23,613
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:25,282 --> 00:00:25,623
Rym: Last night.

9
00:00:25,643 --> 00:00:29,196
Rym: I actually went to a concert like down at the Highline Ballroom.

10
00:00:29,256 --> 00:00:29,737
Rym: It was pretty good.

11
00:00:30,159 --> 00:00:33,339
Rym: Okay I went to see the Aquabats, but isn't that a band for children?

12
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,183
Rym: Ostensibly yes.

13
00:00:35,203 --> 00:00:39,260
Scott: I mean my sister liked them when she was still pre-college age.

14
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:45,679
Rym: well, they had like a kids show, but they're basically like a neo ska Band and they play real music.

15
00:00:46,193 --> 00:00:47,464
Rym: Yeah and it was a good show.

16
00:00:47,504 --> 00:01:00,047
Rym: like I was that I went and it was interesting because a lot of the audience was like a Third parents with like young kids a third people our age and a third people older than us who were just like Really into the Aquabats.

17
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:01,072
Scott: That's weird.

18
00:01:01,153 --> 00:01:03,715
Rym: I didn't know about the older crew though You know what the opening acts were?

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,707
Rym: Reggie and the full effect which was.

20
00:01:07,169 --> 00:01:07,872
Scott: I've heard of it.

21
00:01:08,073 --> 00:01:09,920
Rym: There was an interesting set.

22
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,516
Rym: They did and they actually dune came up which is why I mentioned this.

23
00:01:14,038 --> 00:01:14,460
Scott: What the hell?

24
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:15,386
Rym: So he does like.

25
00:01:15,427 --> 00:01:16,820
Rym: he plays these songs that are kind of weird.

26
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,628
Rym: it's almost like a joke band and they like.

27
00:01:18,648 --> 00:01:20,939
Rym: they come out and these they're all dressed like the Cobra Kai.

28
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:29,900
Rym: and Then the main guy comes out and he's dressed up like Daniel-san from karate kid And he does like a song and stand up and kind of back and forth.

29
00:01:30,542 --> 00:01:33,433
Rym: And he tells this anecdote where he was like I guess drunk or something.

30
00:01:33,734 --> 00:01:37,507
Rym: and he went to see showgirls in the theater Which I've never actually seen.

31
00:01:37,527 --> 00:01:38,713
Scott: I haven't seen that either.

32
00:01:38,733 --> 00:01:44,334
Rym: apparently the dude who played Paul Atreides in one of the dune adaptations is a character.

33
00:01:44,374 --> 00:01:45,920
Rym: He plays a character in that movie.

34
00:01:46,302 --> 00:01:49,480
Scott: The only thing I know about showgirls is that the girl from Saved by the Bell gets naked.

35
00:01:49,823 --> 00:01:50,610
Rym: Oh, yeah, that's that.

36
00:01:50,651 --> 00:01:51,620
Rym: That is the other thing that I knew.

37
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:54,220
Scott: That's the only thing I. that's the only thing I know about that movie.

38
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,353
Scott: It was like a big deal because it was when it came out.

39
00:01:57,373 --> 00:01:59,080
Scott: It was NC 17 and not yokes.

40
00:01:59,501 --> 00:02:02,873
Scott: So it was actually in movie theater and his anecdote was around that.

41
00:02:02,913 --> 00:02:03,294
Rym: how like.

42
00:02:03,535 --> 00:02:06,148
Rym: it's kind of shameful that he went to see that Movie because that movie's not good.

43
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:06,732
Scott: No, but

44
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:27,255
Rym: Apparently because the person who played Paul Atreides is in this movie playing some other character He tells his long anecdote where he's there seeing the movie on like opening night and the theaters packed and that dude comes on screen And he just sort of blurts out like Maa Dib Maa Dib and one other person in the audience laughed.

45
00:02:27,556 --> 00:02:31,151
Rym: I don't even know If someone just has never seen any of the adaptations.

46
00:02:31,393 --> 00:02:34,335
Scott: if someone just goes Maa Dib Maa Dib I don't know what the fuck that means.

47
00:02:34,355 --> 00:02:37,743
Rym: Yeah Laughed at it.

48
00:02:38,005 --> 00:02:43,003
Scott: Yeah, I can see there's an apostrophe pronounced Kwisatz Haderach Kwisatz Haderach.

49
00:02:43,203 --> 00:02:43,364
Rym: Yeah.

50
00:02:43,384 --> 00:02:43,805
Rym: All right.

51
00:02:44,006 --> 00:02:48,520
Rym: Well, apparently that's it's like real close to this Kabbalah word for someone who can teleport.

52
00:02:48,681 --> 00:02:50,491
Rym: I was I read a little bit up on dune.

53
00:02:50,511 --> 00:02:51,054
Rym: Mm-hmm.

54
00:02:51,477 --> 00:02:54,187
Rym: Oh, you know Kabbalah Can you cast Kabbalah spells?

55
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:54,851
Scott: Mm-hmm.

56
00:02:55,414 --> 00:02:56,640
Rym: So anyway, yeah, the concert was great.

57
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:03,760
Rym: But you know the other opening act was CJ Ramone as in the old lead singer of the Ramones and they just did like classic punk and it was awesome.

58
00:03:04,182 --> 00:03:08,217
Rym: Okay, so it's a pretty good show and dune came up which was weird.

59
00:03:08,297 --> 00:03:15,443
Rym: and then like There was this long segment where he keeps telling all these dune jokes and half the audience gets it and half the audience has no Idea what's going on?

60
00:03:15,503 --> 00:03:17,450
Rym: And then that was just interesting.

61
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,333
Rym: and that's all I had there.

62
00:03:18,353 --> 00:03:27,967
Rym: and I'm just killing time before Things of the day.

63
00:03:27,987 --> 00:03:28,670
Rym: So what do you got?

64
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:28,991
Rym: actually?

65
00:03:29,011 --> 00:03:31,140
Rym: I can see it here but tell the crowd what you got.

66
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:35,318
Scott: So this is someone runs this website called what email put games by email calm.

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,161
Rym: It's a.

68
00:03:36,321 --> 00:03:41,437
Scott: it's a website where you can play games by email and a lot of those games involve dice and randomness, right?

69
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:58,758
Scott: So people who are dedicated enough to play a game by email are the kind of person who's really gonna care about the randomness of those dice and they don't probably know enough about Dev random to realize that that's actually pretty legit.

70
00:03:58,798 --> 00:03:59,912
Scott: random I'm just saying so.

71
00:04:00,862 --> 00:04:07,859
Scott: Basically, he was the website was originally coded just to use the random number generators that are in computers Which are fine for games like this.

72
00:04:08,023 --> 00:04:16,367
Scott: yep And but people complained about the randomness like they complained like they were winning or losing because the randomness was no good Because people can't tell what's random.

73
00:04:16,588 --> 00:04:17,231
Scott: Yep.

74
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:27,899
Scott: So people were like according to this article by the creator of this website We're like putting more effort and writing like dissertations on the right the bad randomness of games by email calm.

75
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:36,803
Scott: so The creator of games by email calm made a machine that physically rolls actual goddamn dice 200,000 rolls

76
00:04:36,823 --> 00:04:38,982
Rym: a day 200,000

77
00:04:38,982 --> 00:04:49,380
Scott: dice rolls a day and uses computer vision to look at the dice To capture the numbers that they have rolled and then it uses those numbers to you know for all of the games by email.

78
00:04:50,242 --> 00:04:53,470
Scott: So you cannot possibly complain about the randomness and evil.

79
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:57,320
Scott: still complain people still complain because people don't know what the fuck they're talking about.

80
00:04:57,762 --> 00:05:01,280
Scott: But you know, if you're really upset, he'll send you some dice from the thing.

81
00:05:01,561 --> 00:05:04,440
Rym: Well, he'll crush them and send them to you as an example to the other dice.

82
00:05:04,728 --> 00:05:13,970
Rym: Sure the the funniest thing about this is that he points out that one side effect of the way you built it is that it Destroys the dice and there's a high rate of die attrition.

83
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:17,180
Scott: dice can only roll so many times before they disintegrate.

84
00:05:17,662 --> 00:05:22,518
Rym: Casino dice like they wear out real fast actually change the dice in the casino like constantly.

85
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:31,700
Scott: now Imagine actually this gives me a cool idea at a con like packs or especially PAX Unplugged Like if you think about how much how much the dice in a casino roll in a day even unfelt.

86
00:05:32,142 --> 00:05:36,100
Scott: Like if you didn't change them, you'd have like balls in like, you know some weeks.

87
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,989
Scott: Well, like it'd be really smooth like a burning wheel.

88
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:42,520
Rym: I roll my dice like six times tops in a given night.

89
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:44,414
Scott: Yeah, if you just played burning wheel all day.

90
00:05:44,495 --> 00:05:48,069
Scott: every day though Your dice would turn into balls because due to erosion.

91
00:05:48,109 --> 00:05:50,897
Rym: really I've seen some ball looking Warhammer dice before.

92
00:05:51,178 --> 00:05:51,760
Scott: I know right?

93
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:58,180
Rym: So but imagine so, you know like in a fancy wedding of like the champagne fountain or some nonsense at the chocolate fountain.

94
00:05:58,361 --> 00:05:59,659
Scott: Yeah, we want to have a dice bow.

95
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:08,711
Rym: Imagine at the middle of packs PAX Unplugged there's a dice fountain and in the packs app You could just ask it for die rolls from that thing during packs.

96
00:06:09,032 --> 00:06:09,212
Rym: Mm-hmm.

97
00:06:09,413 --> 00:06:11,800
Rym: That would be like the cool weird thing to do.

98
00:06:12,402 --> 00:06:14,692
Scott: I'm just saying check out this cool dice rolling.

99
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:15,456
Rym: It's pretty cool.

100
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:17,024
Rym: Like it's it's legit I would.

101
00:06:17,124 --> 00:06:19,137
Scott: you know, I don't really even it only rolls d6.

102
00:06:19,841 --> 00:06:25,067
Scott: I wish he would start a service where like I don't want to play any games by email I just want to app on my phone.

103
00:06:25,128 --> 00:06:27,380
Scott: right if I need a real dice roll I can get one from there.

104
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:34,102
Rym: Yeah, especially if it showed me a picture of the dice I feel like that would like seal the deal with people who don't understand RNG Mm-hmm.

105
00:06:34,665 --> 00:06:38,120
Rym: So all I got is, you know way back in her undertale was a fantastic game.

106
00:06:38,222 --> 00:06:47,469
Rym: I love the hell out of it but the Phantom around it kind of got like pony level of creation of stuff and People made all these like animatics and cool things.

107
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:55,079
Rym: and I just noticed recently that one of those animatics They actually went and finished the entire animation like they made the thing and it's done and it's out there.

108
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:58,991
Rym: Okay, and it's actually like really super well done.

109
00:06:59,011 --> 00:07:03,945
Rym: and it's the the fight you see between a Character and another character.

110
00:07:04,226 --> 00:07:07,356
Rym: that is spoiler that you'll only see if you do a genocide route and murder people.

111
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:09,923
Rym: and it's just super Well done.

112
00:07:09,943 --> 00:07:11,288
Rym: and I'm really impressed with it.

113
00:07:11,548 --> 00:07:21,998
Rym: and I'm extra impressed that some fan animatic stuff turned into a finished thing because oftentimes you see a YouTube thing that's like work in progress and that is literally the last thing ever uploaded on that account.

114
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,920
Rym: Okay, so I'm impressed by the fact that this finished and it's legit good.

115
00:07:27,463 --> 00:07:34,559
Rym: And also if you don't want to do the genocide run, which I didn't because I'm not a bad person You can see some of the stuff that you wouldn't see otherwise in the game.

116
00:07:35,821 --> 00:07:37,506
Rym: And that's that other than in the meta moment.

117
00:07:38,128 --> 00:07:38,670
Rym: The book club book.

118
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,355
Rym: is Dune talking about it.

119
00:07:40,436 --> 00:07:43,909
Scott: in like two minutes I'd selected a new book club book.

120
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,556
Rym: Oh, so what is the new book club book?

121
00:07:45,576 --> 00:07:46,118
Scott: I'm gonna find it.

122
00:07:46,138 --> 00:07:48,640
Scott: Hold on Oh, yeah, so cuz I'm like Ram.

123
00:07:48,983 --> 00:07:50,580
Scott: It doesn't take me long to select a new book club.

124
00:07:50,921 --> 00:07:59,205
Rym: All I'm gonna warn you about is that if you did not read Dune, you're going to spoil Dune Dunes pretty straightforward.

125
00:07:59,726 --> 00:08:07,832
Scott: I mean, I feel like like do it like so dude was already spoiled like Old that the statute of limitations is out.

126
00:08:07,872 --> 00:08:10,280
Scott: Like I knew a lot of shit about doing before I read it.

127
00:08:11,143 --> 00:08:12,309
Rym: I don't think anything.

128
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:18,612
Rym: any event that happened in this book surprised me No But anyway other than that the Baron was way worse than I thought.

129
00:08:18,853 --> 00:08:20,480
Scott: the next book club book is.

130
00:08:20,862 --> 00:08:22,190
Scott: So there's this lady in Brooklyn.

131
00:08:22,673 --> 00:08:23,740
Scott: I think she still lives in Brooklyn.

132
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,915
Scott: I saw her at gamer X last year, but I mean I knew about her before then.

133
00:08:27,116 --> 00:08:27,880
Rym: Oh right that book.

134
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,009
Scott: Yeah, so well, she's got a lot of books.

135
00:08:30,029 --> 00:08:30,611
Scott: So her name is.

136
00:08:30,631 --> 00:08:31,535
Rym: you talked about this book.

137
00:08:31,575 --> 00:08:32,178
Rym: You wanted to do it.

138
00:08:32,198 --> 00:08:43,857
Scott: Her name is NK Jemisin, right and she apparently writes these fantasy novels that are like the hotness right now Or they've been the hotness for like a year or two, but you know fantasy novels.

139
00:08:43,876 --> 00:08:44,340
Scott: you got time.

140
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:48,783
Scott: You don't got to stay on top of those and read them as soon as they come out unless it's a prince of nothing I'm just saying.

141
00:08:48,803 --> 00:08:52,420
Scott: but I mean we even read the first prince of nothing how long after it came out, right?

142
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,820
Rym: Yeah, like three cycles of our friends had already read that book before we read it, right?

143
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:00,577
Scott: It's like, you know, so it's still the new hotness because books are slow compared to say YouTube.

144
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:06,500
Scott: Yeah So I think this is like she's got a lot of books in there if you go to Amazon.

145
00:09:06,961 --> 00:09:12,760
Scott: But apparently the hottest book is this series which is about the broken earth.

146
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:23,302
Scott: So the broken earth book number one is called the fifth season and the cover is green, which is good Because some of the other covers are like red or blue Careful.

147
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:30,124
Rym: the cover of I think the third of that horrible trilogy dragons gold serpent silver Cameras copper was green.

148
00:09:30,145 --> 00:09:32,753
Scott: I'm just saying just say I've read.

149
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:35,060
Scott: I actually started reading like a chapter of this book.

150
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,700
Rym: It's three dollars on Kindle.

151
00:09:36,841 --> 00:09:43,145
Scott: Yeah, I started reading one chapter of this book before I switched to do not because this was no good But because I had to read the book.

152
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:43,707
Rym: I just bought it.

153
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:51,890
Scott: So so yeah, this is like praised by Everybody like that you ever knew this is mad.

154
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:52,853
Scott: got like so much praise.

155
00:09:52,953 --> 00:09:54,780
Rym: this won the Hugo Award for best novel.

156
00:09:55,181 --> 00:09:59,920
Scott: This book is a huge huge hotness in the world of fantasy.

157
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:13,539
Scott: It's like people who know like whose main nerdery is fantasy type sci-fi type novels, you know, those kind of nerds They're like all over this already like this, you know, but if you're just a regular old nerd, you know And that's sort of off to the side.

158
00:10:14,162 --> 00:10:15,688
Scott: Well, this is what you're missing apparently.

159
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:17,054
Scott: So let's find out what the deal is.

160
00:10:17,536 --> 00:10:30,220
Rym: All right, I'm into it But be warned the last of the Prince of Nothing books is coming out imminently five days Supposedly, I think we're gonna read that first and then we're gonna jump on this book.

161
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,025
Scott: But it doesn't count as book club though.

162
00:10:32,085 --> 00:10:33,890
Rym: No, that's just the ongoing.

163
00:10:33,971 --> 00:10:35,756
Rym: That's like our favorite fantasy book series.

164
00:10:35,796 --> 00:10:36,959
Rym: for some reason, right?

165
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:39,457
Scott: Something about it.

166
00:10:39,719 --> 00:10:42,005
Rym: Yeah We'll see how it ends.

167
00:10:42,085 --> 00:10:44,374
Scott: I'm mostly the horses and men getting broken.

168
00:10:44,736 --> 00:10:47,525
Rym: I just the literal Broken horse.

169
00:10:47,545 --> 00:10:48,049
Rym: Mm-hmm.

170
00:10:48,592 --> 00:10:56,645
Rym: I guess I should have seen that coming Mm-hmm, but like should have seen us betrayal coming because the book literally says from like page three I did see it coming.

171
00:10:56,665 --> 00:10:57,549
Scott: I was just waiting to see.

172
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,620
Rym: I think everyone sees what's coming.

173
00:11:00,001 --> 00:11:01,206
Rym: So yeah, we're talking about Dune.

174
00:11:01,507 --> 00:11:04,860
Rym: So last warning if you somehow don't gonna do any meta moments.

175
00:11:05,542 --> 00:11:07,028
Rym: Uh, the next book club was that.

176
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:10,300
Rym: oh, yeah, we're going to be at PAX West doing at least one panel.

177
00:11:10,601 --> 00:11:18,713
Rym: We're doing a much updated and rewritten panel on quitting Focusing more on specifically people who quit because they're butter.

178
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:19,395
Scott: translation.

179
00:11:19,435 --> 00:11:21,020
Scott: barely changed because we had new ideas.

180
00:11:21,241 --> 00:11:22,427
Scott: We had no new ideas.

181
00:11:22,508 --> 00:11:24,700
Rym: I think it is gonna be significantly changed barely change.

182
00:11:24,881 --> 00:11:31,932
Rym: We ran that old quitting panel again at ConnectiCon and I actually have a much more Specific and nuanced point.

183
00:11:31,972 --> 00:11:34,346
Rym: I want to make about quitting Insignificantly changed.

184
00:11:34,487 --> 00:11:35,752
Rym: I think it'll be significantly changed.

185
00:11:35,772 --> 00:11:39,586
Scott: doesn't have any new ideas for panels Actually, it's trying to get a free ticket again.

186
00:11:39,606 --> 00:11:45,082
Rym: I did submit like three other panels, but this is one they wanted so Mm-hmm.

187
00:11:45,745 --> 00:11:55,290
Rym: So yeah, otherwise, I think the next con after that is gonna be PAX Unplugged Which will be at doing a bunch of panels and then pecs Australia Which I'm very likely to be at and I am now.

188
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:58,279
Rym: I'm 100% confident that our friend row is also going to be there.

189
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:13,042
Rym: Because well, we'll talk about that in the next Tuesday show, but for the first time ever GeekNights has an official champion in the omegathon finale Finale.

190
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:14,668
Scott: you got to make it to the finale.

191
00:12:14,728 --> 00:12:17,820
Rym: I'm pretty much Babe Ruth and I'm pre Babe Ruth in her.

192
00:12:18,061 --> 00:12:19,046
Scott: That's a bad idea.

193
00:12:19,127 --> 00:12:21,540
Rym: row is pro Rose like the most pro we know.

194
00:12:21,624 --> 00:12:26,415
Scott: Yeah But the omega-thon might have a random round two or some shit and then what it will and then what.

195
00:12:26,696 --> 00:12:32,114
Rym: but usually the random isn't Like in or out it's the bottom of a pile is gonna be knocked.

196
00:12:32,315 --> 00:12:34,758
Scott: out is saying I mean I don't like it happen.

197
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:43,891
Rym: well either we're gonna be going crazy at the omega-thon finale because row is pro or We're going to be heckling mercilessly whoever it is that knocked row out.

198
00:12:44,071 --> 00:12:46,218
Scott: I think we're just gonna be heckling mercilessly either way.

199
00:12:46,238 --> 00:12:48,146
Rym: Yeah we're.

200
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:51,932
Rym: uh We've never been this invested in an omega-thon before.

201
00:12:52,194 --> 00:12:52,857
Scott: why would we be?

202
00:12:53,238 --> 00:13:08,578
Rym: Yeah It's an extra fitting because the first packs we ever went to Row who is just like a listener like a fan of GeekNights offered to pick us up at the airport and we just trusted the stranger to like show up at the airport and like literally pick us up and drive us to a hotel.

203
00:13:08,598 --> 00:13:11,659
Rym: and It totally happened and it was cool.

204
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,468
Rym: So that otherwise our YouTube channels to go in.

205
00:13:14,809 --> 00:13:18,500
Rym: we're live streaming this podcast so you could actually watch like my sweaty butt.

206
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,129
Rym: I don't know about.

207
00:13:19,189 --> 00:13:19,859
Scott: you don't need to do that.

208
00:13:20,221 --> 00:13:20,684
Rym: There are.

209
00:13:20,704 --> 00:13:22,575
Scott: I don't even need to be listening to this like you should.

210
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:27,160
Scott: if you're listening to geek Surely there must be some better way you could be spending this hour of your life.

211
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:33,920
Rym: There are nine people watching us live right now nine saddest people and there are way more than nine messages in this chat.

212
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,026
Scott: Nine sad messages.

213
00:13:36,548 --> 00:13:38,576
Rym: there are in fact, one, two, three, four five.

214
00:13:38,616 --> 00:13:39,680
Scott: There's only one night.

215
00:13:39,921 --> 00:13:45,340
Rym: Oh, oh, no, there there's actually exactly nine messages in the chat and there is one message that is not sad.

216
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,648
Scott: So it's actually only eight sad mess.

217
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:48,972
Rym: No, these guys they seem pretty chill.

218
00:13:48,992 --> 00:13:49,454
Rym: They're happy.

219
00:13:49,474 --> 00:13:51,220
Scott: No, there's one message is not sad.

220
00:13:52,204 --> 00:13:53,900
Rym: I think though your message is the only sad one.

221
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,906
Rym: That's the not sad one, even though I have the same policy.

222
00:13:55,926 --> 00:13:57,451
Rym: But anyway, I digress dude.

223
00:13:57,832 --> 00:14:04,440
Rym: We're talking about Frank Herbert's 1965 epic science fiction novel called dune, right?

224
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:11,180
Scott: So this is like one of the legendary nerd books of all time and we never read it into completion before.

225
00:14:11,241 --> 00:14:12,239
Scott: Yep in middle school.

226
00:14:12,826 --> 00:14:17,480
Scott: I've said this before but you know We got to say everything about the book in the actual episode about the book, right?

227
00:14:17,841 --> 00:14:19,272
Scott: I think in middle school or something.

228
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:20,038
Scott: I don't remember.

229
00:14:20,058 --> 00:14:27,426
Scott: ish I tried to read it and because it was such a famous nerd book and I did not get very far and was Unpleased with it.

230
00:14:27,506 --> 00:14:36,811
Scott: and then for a long period of my life, you know Especially at RIT nerds would talk about doing on occasion because that's gonna happen and I'd be like, yeah, I'm not into dune I don't know what the deal is.

231
00:14:36,831 --> 00:14:43,210
Rym: I don't know why Star Trek either I just sorta like.

232
00:14:43,651 --> 00:14:46,760
Rym: I always heard that people talked about doing a lot and I read a little bit of it.

233
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:51,400
Rym: I didn't care that much and I was into really dumb fantasy novels back then.

234
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:51,741
Rym: Yeah,

235
00:14:51,862 --> 00:15:01,400
Scott: as time went on Eve just by being a nerd and living in the internet and knowing nerds I learned things about dune because that's how happens and we played the dune game, which is quite a good game

236
00:15:01,641 --> 00:15:04,697
Rym: And actually I have a lot more to say about that game now that I read this book.

237
00:15:04,817 --> 00:15:08,240
Rym: Oh, yeah But anyway save that talk for the end though, right?

238
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,515
Scott: So I said, you know, we know we got this book club going on.

239
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:15,140
Scott: even you know We did that wheel of time on basically the same premise, right?

240
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:19,877
Scott: Which was like hey because you're a nerd what good or bad you sort of have to read this cuz and

241
00:15:19,917 --> 00:15:24,060
Rym: a side effect of that Was I actually just read all of the wheel of time

242
00:15:24,703 --> 00:15:28,460
Scott: Anyway, but which you see wouldn't have even read one of those if not for me selecting it.

243
00:15:28,682 --> 00:15:30,113
Rym: I ain't gonna do that with dune.

244
00:15:30,778 --> 00:15:35,495
Scott: So I said well, you ain't a nerd if you haven't read the dune good or bad.

245
00:15:35,575 --> 00:15:36,479
Scott: So let's read the dune.

246
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:45,079
Rym: So the most important thing I want to get out there is that one despite having not read it until now It is exactly what I thought it was.

247
00:15:46,021 --> 00:15:52,996
Rym: Nothing was surprising at all And I already knew almost the entire plot just from casual pop culture interaction in the first.

248
00:15:53,056 --> 00:15:53,197
Scott: like.

249
00:15:53,317 --> 00:15:57,512
Scott: there are all these proper Nouns about dune that I vaguely knew what they had.

250
00:15:57,532 --> 00:15:59,980
Rym: them all straight in like a few pages, right?

251
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:06,474
Scott: But in like the first chapter every single one of those proper nouns is introduced But then every single one of them like right away.

252
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:08,882
Rym: They're all explained Explicitly.

253
00:16:09,465 --> 00:16:12,180
Scott: a lot of them get explained explicitly pretty much right away.

254
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:20,232
Scott: But the one thing I think that they're lacking is that in I'm gonna compare it to Prince of Nothing Because that's how we do.

255
00:16:20,292 --> 00:16:21,500
Rym: This is like 90%.

256
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,926
Rym: I'm gonna be comparing this to Prince of Nothing.

257
00:16:22,946 --> 00:16:25,014
Scott: But anyway in Prince of Nothing, it's proper.

258
00:16:25,054 --> 00:16:26,620
Scott: It's even more proper noun hell.

259
00:16:26,761 --> 00:16:43,427
Scott: However, the Prince of Nothing Uses, you know Latin roots and you know roots itself But it's proper nouns in real-world languages Which this does too in a way that you can infer the meaning of the word Just from how it feels.

260
00:16:43,527 --> 00:16:48,500
Scott: to read and say whereas dune does not do that because that's how to act doesn't mean shit.

261
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:53,645
Rym: You get that explanation Apparently, you know Kabbalah.

262
00:16:53,705 --> 00:16:55,128
Rym: it's like a spell I guess.

263
00:16:55,168 --> 00:16:58,617
Scott: in the Kabbalah maybe but in Prince of Nothing.

264
00:16:58,677 --> 00:17:03,860
Scott: if someone says I own the Ione or Ionia Ionia sounds like the name of a country.

265
00:17:04,402 --> 00:17:13,577
Scott: it and it is and it kind of feels like the name of a country like Ionia wouldn't be a name of a Beverage or a person right it cuz it ends in yeah, right?

266
00:17:13,656 --> 00:17:17,007
Rym: It's like oh, that's Or just II I don't remember.

267
00:17:17,027 --> 00:17:27,987
Scott: well Ionia is you know, well I'm saying with the AI the Ione people right So that Ionia is a great anyway, right, but I'm saying to say like Ione It's like oh that feels like.

268
00:17:28,429 --> 00:17:31,080
Scott: it just feels like, you know, your name wouldn't be Ione.

269
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:37,844
Scott: So I'd say that a lot of the name of our people like when you read it in context It's like the Ione.

270
00:17:37,884 --> 00:17:44,427
Rym: but a lot of a lot of the words in dune are like based in languages and have some reasonable Context but a lot of them aren't.

271
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:52,396
Rym: but more importantly rather than just being used by Characters and then you infer meaning the same way you infer meaning in real the real world.

272
00:17:52,717 --> 00:17:59,360
Rym: when you talk to people Dune introduces terms and then sort of just explicitly explains what they are.

273
00:17:59,922 --> 00:18:02,572
Rym: It never just casually uses a word it waits you to figure it out.

274
00:18:02,913 --> 00:18:04,700
Rym: It explains what it all is at some point.

275
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,307
Rym: Mm-hmm and also some of like the.

276
00:18:07,769 --> 00:18:11,620
Rym: the provenance of these words like the etymology like what they seem to be based on.

277
00:18:12,061 --> 00:18:17,717
Rym: It's just like a vague smattering of like Arabic and Persian and Hebrew and stuff.

278
00:18:17,737 --> 00:18:18,659
Rym: Just sort of all mixed up.

279
00:18:19,102 --> 00:18:20,518
Rym: Mm-hmm and some of them like chamurky.

280
00:18:21,861 --> 00:18:27,600
Rym: That was not that important and I was shocked at how specifically they focused on the different kinds of poisons.

281
00:18:28,381 --> 00:18:30,345
Scott: Yeah, which is kind of poison.

282
00:18:31,046 --> 00:18:43,330
Rym: The other thing is that the book is really straightforward and the characters are really simple and The world that is constructed is actually also pretty simple.

283
00:18:44,131 --> 00:18:45,896
Scott: Yeah, like there's nothing fancy about it.

284
00:18:45,956 --> 00:18:46,177
Scott: Right?

285
00:18:46,197 --> 00:18:48,143
Scott: You know, it's like there's no mysteries.

286
00:18:48,183 --> 00:18:50,650
Scott: There's literally even wheel of time is fancier.

287
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:52,519
Scott: It's like ooh, like what's the deal?

288
00:18:52,659 --> 00:18:53,624
Scott: What's the deal in doing?

289
00:18:53,644 --> 00:18:54,327
Scott: you're never asking?

290
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:54,890
Scott: What's the deal?

291
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,716
Scott: Even the stuff they try to keep in mystery.

292
00:18:57,058 --> 00:19:00,110
Scott: like the guild it's like oh and the cages blows his load.

293
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:00,954
Scott: It's like you can.

294
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:07,530
Rym: just a spaceman loses his contact in the end and you see his eyes are blue and you're like Oh, I see what's going on, but I knew that they were fucked.

295
00:19:07,631 --> 00:19:09,750
Scott: I knew they were fucked up in spice a long time ago.

296
00:19:09,931 --> 00:19:14,458
Scott: That before you read the book cuz it always talks about how Even in the book it like it right away.

297
00:19:14,478 --> 00:19:16,165
Scott: It talks about like yeah, the guild loves this.

298
00:19:16,245 --> 00:19:17,370
Scott: They keep buying all the spice.

299
00:19:17,611 --> 00:19:21,091
Scott: Yeah, they're selling all the spice to the guild and then it's like oh It's.

300
00:19:21,231 --> 00:19:24,670
Scott: it's supposed to be a big reveal that despite that the guild guy has blue eyes, too.

301
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:32,790
Rym: That might have been a bigger reveal if not for the fact that we knew a lot about - no They tell you earlier in the book that like the guild people are buying all the spice.

302
00:19:33,171 --> 00:19:47,672
Rym: Make a big point about how the Emperor and the guild and the Harkonnen are all Hoarding spice because it's literally the most valuable thing in the world and because there's that big plot They're obviously hoarding it to corner the market when the plot happens like.

303
00:19:47,993 --> 00:19:54,775
Rym: the book does set up all these rational explanations and it is easy to feel like we Figured stuff out earlier.

304
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,099
Scott: partly because it does it.

305
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,728
Scott: there's no figuring stuff out earlier like at one point.

306
00:20:00,011 --> 00:20:00,614
Scott: What's this?

307
00:20:00,654 --> 00:20:03,690
Scott: Paul has like a you know, one of his visions and it's like yeah he had a vision.

308
00:20:03,832 --> 00:20:09,425
Scott: It's like literally like, you know He had a vision of the future where he's a pilot of a guild spaceship all fucked up on spice.

309
00:20:09,727 --> 00:20:13,029
Scott: and it's like oh Well, they just that's already halfway through the book, right?

310
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:18,454
Scott: But it's like they just tell it to you and that's way before the end of the book where they wrote It's the good.

311
00:20:18,494 --> 00:20:20,323
Scott: this guild guy loses contact lens.

312
00:20:20,363 --> 00:20:21,307
Scott: Yeah, right.

313
00:20:21,327 --> 00:20:24,849
Rym: at the same time It causes sort of interesting thing that I haven't seen in a lot of books.

314
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:28,110
Rym: Where to compare to the prince of nothing or wheel of time?

315
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:43,864
Rym: When you're in a cow perspective of a character you tend to be there for a while like you're in some random characters head like you're in the I don't know a Cameon's head because each chapter will be coming like from a specific character in dune.

316
00:20:44,065 --> 00:20:46,110
Scott: There's just sort of this narrator, right?

317
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:52,550
Rym: Well, you jump between the characters heads a lot Yeah And you get their exact thoughts like in the say like it's best.

318
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:57,038
Rym: There's one scene in the book that dinner party Which is probably my favorite scene in the entire book.

319
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:00,670
Rym: Mmm, and it's literally like all the big important characters.

320
00:21:01,312 --> 00:21:07,999
Rym: Well, most of them are at this dinner party and it's one of those like high Political tension like everyone like what's going?

321
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,827
Rym: all these people have different motivations.

322
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:10,630
Rym: What do they want?

323
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:12,015
Rym: what's that guy gonna do?

324
00:21:12,296 --> 00:21:13,762
Rym: like everyone's posturing?

325
00:21:13,802 --> 00:21:21,050
Rym: and there's intrigue and drama but Every character's motivation is explicitly explained to you the reader.

326
00:21:21,612 --> 00:21:26,750
Rym: You literally know everyone's secret everyone's motivation everyone's everything throughout that entire scene, right?

327
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:30,170
Scott: This is I told you this is omniscient narrator just sort of telling you the story.

328
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,986
Rym: Well kind of like how Paul Atreides becomes omniscient, right?

329
00:21:33,006 --> 00:21:33,649
Scott: But it's not.

330
00:21:34,712 --> 00:21:41,518
Scott: You know a lot of books will use sort of like narrative devices like, you know First-person storytelling or like saga.

331
00:21:41,678 --> 00:21:48,377
Scott: you have like the daughter is telling the story from when she's older about her baby years Like oh my parents such-and-such.

332
00:21:48,397 --> 00:21:48,577
Scott: right.

333
00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:52,270
Scott: Dune is literally using no fancy writing techniques whatsoever.

334
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:57,195
Scott: It's just a narrator and dialogue between characters Characters perspective and like.

335
00:21:57,456 --> 00:22:05,069
Rym: what are those better Jesser and up to and it cuts to Jessica and Jessica's like I am up to XY and Z. That is what I want.

336
00:22:05,251 --> 00:22:08,870
Scott: It reads the way that like a D&D book could read like oh the you know.

337
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:12,067
Scott: Or like it's written the same way that you know much better.

338
00:22:12,168 --> 00:22:16,280
Rym: obviously Like that those D&D books hide everything from you.

339
00:22:16,722 --> 00:22:24,190
Scott: no, no not in terms of the hiding in the information But in terms of just the the fact that it's a narrator, you know, just telling you what's happening, right?

340
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:28,305
Scott: It's not written in a fancy, you know, there's no sort of device right?

341
00:22:28,365 --> 00:22:33,010
Rym: Yeah in the way that it's told Well, the pros is pretty simple too, but that's not what I want to focus on yet.

342
00:22:34,694 --> 00:22:42,830
Rym: But I feel like the story is actually kind of the same story that Hyperion is trying to tell and that parts of The Princess of Nothing are trying to tell a lot of things.

343
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:45,017
Scott: Obviously you mean you mean things that came after this?

344
00:22:45,078 --> 00:22:48,569
Rym: Yeah crib from Dune, but the story is just I mean it is.

345
00:22:48,870 --> 00:23:00,569
Scott: It is one of those situations where something is such a big deal in the nerd world and so famous But you didn't read it and when you go back to it you realize Oh all the things were borrowing or referencing or homaging this and I missed it.

346
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,878
Rym: So then I read a spoiler.

347
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,510
Rym: so in one of the later Dune books There's a group of people called the face dancers.

348
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:12,361
Rym: They could do the thing with their faces to look like anyone just like the the what sits in The Prince of Nothing Like that exact same thing.

349
00:23:12,462 --> 00:23:15,428
Rym: Yeah, but the story is just.

350
00:23:16,112 --> 00:23:21,427
Rym: humanity has this like transhumanist crisis because they invent AI and they have nuclear weapons.

351
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,501
Rym: and It's almost like you.

352
00:23:23,521 --> 00:23:24,370
Rym: look at the culture books.

353
00:23:24,671 --> 00:23:25,836
Rym: The culture books are the.

354
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,250
Rym: what if humans just embrace transhumanism and become crazy different?

355
00:23:29,772 --> 00:23:34,390
Rym: Awesome and Dune is what if humans freak out and try to remain human forever?

356
00:23:34,832 --> 00:23:43,750
Rym: Mm-hmm, and the only story here is that you have this existence of humanity that Had this like transhumanist crisis and it's discreet.

357
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:50,870
Rym: Oh, they've mentioned it as the butlerian jihad where they basically said, you know Thou shalt not to figure this figure this way before the beginning of the book.

358
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:53,884
Rym: Yeah, but it's explained pretty explicitly like nothing.

359
00:23:54,045 --> 00:23:54,788
Scott: They just tell it to you.

360
00:23:55,235 --> 00:24:00,000
Scott: Yeah Especially in that appendix the history of the human race is not like a mystery to humans.

361
00:24:00,141 --> 00:24:12,150
Rym: humans decide you can't make Humans have to be human as they are now Literally forever and they issue all technology that could make humans different, right?

362
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:16,370
Scott: It's weird though, but they keep some technology that they still had there like it's weird.

363
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:25,393
Scott: They'll be fighting with swords and knives and poisons and things and though but they'll also be using like ridiculous fancy poison detecting machines Yeah, the stupors.

364
00:24:25,533 --> 00:24:33,542
Rym: and they'll also be using like lays guns and shields, but they don't use other wet like they use swords Dark guns.

365
00:24:33,582 --> 00:24:38,500
Scott: they have ridiculous Ridiculous spaceships some sort of ornithopter flying device like.

366
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,908
Scott: there's some level of fancy technology.

367
00:24:40,928 --> 00:24:49,230
Scott: That is Simon Simultaneously high but also low and it really feels a lot like the kind of technology that you see in Star Wars, right?

368
00:24:50,013 --> 00:24:51,754
Scott: it's Simultaneously fancy.

369
00:24:51,774 --> 00:24:55,847
Scott: this x-wing could enter hyperspace but go somewhere else but look at it.

370
00:24:55,907 --> 00:24:56,930
Scott: It's a piece of shit, right?

371
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:57,824
Scott: So it's an ornithopter.

372
00:24:57,905 --> 00:24:58,190
Scott: Look at this.

373
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:04,630
Scott: It can fly around and it can survive in this crazy storm kind of but it's obviously not really a great flying device.

374
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:06,170
Scott: It's kind of a piece of shit, right?

375
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:06,511
Scott: But

376
00:25:06,611 --> 00:25:24,632
Rym: the storytelling there is kind of an interesting subtle thing and it's pretty consistent Because remember I mentioned like there's so much focus on those proper nouns of different kinds of poison and all that the society that humans have built is this like static thing where the rules of conflict like if humans have a Conflict.

377
00:25:24,994 --> 00:25:32,163
Rym: the rules are very specific and designed to ensure that Individual humans matter a lot and the technology just not.

378
00:25:32,525 --> 00:25:42,977
Rym: if you want to assassinate someone There are specific rules of the kinds of poison to use and rules of the ways you can try to detect and stop that poison Like if you want to fight someone in.

379
00:25:43,057 --> 00:25:47,210
Scott: obviously all these rules only matter for like these ultra elite people who run the galaxy.

380
00:25:47,391 --> 00:25:48,421
Rym: Oh, yeah, no one else matters.

381
00:25:48,542 --> 00:25:49,430
Rym: normal humans don't matter.

382
00:25:49,731 --> 00:25:55,770
Scott: It's really only a story of you know courts and emperors and kings and dukes and not really a story of normal people.

383
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:58,077
Scott: Yeah, you know they don't matter too much.

384
00:25:58,518 --> 00:26:03,112
Rym: Well, yeah, we can talk a little about normal people other than other than as followers or supporters Of.

385
00:26:03,133 --> 00:26:04,802
Scott: you know, it's very futile system.

386
00:26:04,843 --> 00:26:05,325
Scott: They built it.

387
00:26:05,345 --> 00:26:06,251
Rym: Well, it's literally 10,000 years.

388
00:26:06,271 --> 00:26:16,950
Rym: there is no democracy involved But every rule like the rules of atomics and like the rule of have the fight with someone with knives.

389
00:26:17,071 --> 00:26:19,550
Scott: I didn't use atomics on people.

390
00:26:19,731 --> 00:26:24,064
Scott: I'd atomic that terrain and I just happened to let this horrible storm through that ruined you.

391
00:26:24,506 --> 00:26:35,828
Rym: but the rules are so specific to ensure that among the people who run society an Individual human will be making decisions and matter a lot and nothing else will matter.

392
00:26:35,848 --> 00:26:49,568
Rym: Mm-hmm and that definitely fits into this rule of Humans must remain human and it's this arbitrary definition of humanity at this certain point in time probably right about like the year after the Butlerian Jihad ended.

393
00:26:49,588 --> 00:27:04,999
Rym: and the whole story of Dune seems to be that the Bene Gesserit and like making of the Mentats and all these things like the breeding programs are everybody trying to skirt the rules To make non-humans yet.

394
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:08,750
Rym: They refuse to actually let them be fully non-human.

395
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:11,161
Rym: So they still constrain them and as a result they fail.

396
00:27:11,503 --> 00:27:17,290
Rym: and the story at the end of this book I feel like is Paul Atreides who is the best Mentat and he's there.

397
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:22,190
Rym: He's basically the Dunyane like the end of all that line of genetics and nonsense.

398
00:27:23,252 --> 00:27:26,210
Rym: The the moral of the story is what you made is not human.

399
00:27:26,872 --> 00:27:31,224
Rym: You cannot remain static and the entire book is just telling that story.

400
00:27:31,505 --> 00:27:33,290
Rym: Yeah, pretty much humans are static.

401
00:27:33,491 --> 00:27:34,293
Rym: They're uniform.

402
00:27:34,514 --> 00:27:38,327
Rym: They're boring and they suck and transhumanism is the right way to go.

403
00:27:38,387 --> 00:27:39,170
Rym: The culture is the right way.

404
00:27:40,353 --> 00:27:48,130
Scott: But I think what's also interesting is that you know In putting they were able to put down technology to some extent only because there's also magic, right?

405
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:50,773
Scott: Yeah, there's a lot even though it's a sci-fi Arguably, they.

406
00:27:51,034 --> 00:27:54,509
Scott: it's a sci-fi with the space and the lasers, but it's also the fantasy.

407
00:27:54,717 --> 00:27:56,317
Scott: well so it's like Star Wars again.

408
00:27:56,357 --> 00:27:59,974
Rym: prescience is coached in terms of Higher order.

409
00:28:00,035 --> 00:28:04,799
Rym: beings like the AI's and things that they jahad it against Could access other dimensions.

410
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:12,170
Rym: the Bene Gesserit stuff in the appendix kind of says this Explicitly that their goal in making the quiz ops heterok was to make a multi-dimensional human.

411
00:28:12,972 --> 00:28:17,064
Rym: But the problem is the multi-dimensional human is not humans the multi-dimensional being.

412
00:28:17,385 --> 00:28:19,813
Rym: but the prescience could be Like.

413
00:28:19,913 --> 00:28:21,520
Rym: it can be explained by that stuff.

414
00:28:21,882 --> 00:28:27,421
Rym: Yeah, and also the way Paul Sees the future is definitely cuz you know how there's like the blind spots.

415
00:28:27,462 --> 00:28:28,043
Rym: He can't see.

416
00:28:28,465 --> 00:28:30,090
Rym: it's definitely coached in terms of.

417
00:28:30,512 --> 00:28:38,992
Rym: It's actually just a supercomputer in his mentat brain Calculating based on all the information he has what would have occurred kind of like it I think.

418
00:28:39,112 --> 00:28:52,470
Scott: I think it's also sort of bowing to the sort of possibly true Scientific idea that this basically existing dimensions for all possible futures and they collapse into right.

419
00:28:52,731 --> 00:29:01,461
Scott: So there are certain Nexus points in which you don't you can't really tell which one you're gonna collapse into Because you know, right and then and then as you move.

420
00:29:01,702 --> 00:29:07,160
Scott: as you're slowly going through dimension after dimension It becomes more obvious which ones are more probable than others.

421
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,264
Scott: quantum mechanics.

422
00:29:08,384 --> 00:29:10,130
Scott: Yeah ish kind of thing, right?

423
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:18,828
Scott: It's like you never say any of that explicitly But it sort of leans to similar conceptual ideas to that sort of real-world science in some ways.

424
00:29:19,089 --> 00:29:32,739
Rym: Yep But there's a few points when Paul's having his awakening where he definitely Like it's sort of implied that the parts he can't see here because he doesn't have enough input into his mentat brain and actually He's just a magic computer now.

425
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,185
Rym: Yeah, like he's just a fancy computer.

426
00:29:34,406 --> 00:29:34,627
Rym: I like.

427
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:39,935
Rym: there's one little scene I like where I think his father is like Blah blah blah son.

428
00:29:39,955 --> 00:29:43,910
Rym: You might like you could be a mentat if you want to be and he's like, but that's stupid.

429
00:29:44,453 --> 00:29:47,692
Rym: Uh, I'm like obviously you weren't training me I mean.

430
00:29:47,712 --> 00:29:52,426
Rym: and then he realizes that mentats can't be told that they're being trained.

431
00:29:52,446 --> 00:29:55,709
Rym: and then he's like, oh shit You didn't tell me because I am a mentat.

432
00:29:59,351 --> 00:30:02,624
Scott: So his dad is the best guy in the whole book, yeah, he's got flaws.

433
00:30:02,644 --> 00:30:03,950
Rym: he's not like the best person.

434
00:30:04,331 --> 00:30:08,510
Rym: No, he's a pretty good person by the standards of this fucked up society, right?

435
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:11,261
Scott: It's like whenever I read some fantasy story.

436
00:30:11,321 --> 00:30:13,430
Scott: I always want to read the story about like the great.

437
00:30:13,631 --> 00:30:17,946
Scott: It's always like there's always used to be a kingdom that was great and it it's ass got crumbled.

438
00:30:17,966 --> 00:30:19,030
Scott: and now you're reading the story.

439
00:30:19,592 --> 00:30:22,161
Rym: Nothing you want to read about says watha idea stuck with the came in and in.

440
00:30:22,242 --> 00:30:25,796
Scott: here at least we get a chapter of the Duke in his home place.

441
00:30:25,817 --> 00:30:26,379
Scott: That's awesome.

442
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:26,962
Scott: What's the name of that?

443
00:30:27,043 --> 00:30:27,585
Scott: Awesome planet?

444
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:28,490
Rym: They're from Caledon.

445
00:30:28,751 --> 00:30:29,193
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

446
00:30:29,414 --> 00:30:30,197
Scott: I just want to read like.

447
00:30:30,357 --> 00:30:30,659
Scott: give me the.

448
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,390
Scott: is there a prequel book about just like awesome parties on Caledon?

449
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:35,459
Rym: I think there is a prequel but I've I've.

450
00:30:35,539 --> 00:30:38,090
Rym: I have it on good authority that I should not read any more Dune books.

451
00:30:38,311 --> 00:30:41,350
Scott: I also have that good authority and I don't find I'm wasting my time with it.

452
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:46,230
Rym: It's just like best as every further work is a diminishing returns situation.

453
00:30:46,431 --> 00:30:53,270
Scott: Yeah, but it's like, you know, this Duke is awesome Duke and he just got moved to this other planet by the Emperor for political reasons.

454
00:30:53,531 --> 00:30:53,992
Rym: Yeah, right.

455
00:30:54,233 --> 00:30:55,858
Scott: and it's like even though he's now.

456
00:30:55,878 --> 00:30:59,370
Rym: no, he's only awesome in the context of that feudal nightmare society.

457
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,500
Scott: Sure, right, but he's like as far as Kings go.

458
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,045
Scott: He's legit good.

459
00:31:04,106 --> 00:31:05,410
Scott: You could call this guy a good King.

460
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:05,770
Scott: well like.

461
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:12,609
Rym: there's that scene where he goes out to see the spice harvest and he risks his life and his son's life to save those people.

462
00:31:12,629 --> 00:31:21,770
Rym: and He's very clear like fuck the machines Fuck the spice save those individual like six humans down there and everyone's so like everyone's freaking out about it in any other novel.

463
00:31:22,312 --> 00:31:36,040
Rym: You would wonder if he did that because he actually cared about those people or if it was a clever ploy To like get the Fremen on his side, but because you it doesn't matter but because you know the characters motivations It's obvious that he does actually care about the people.

464
00:31:36,221 --> 00:31:36,361
Scott: Yeah.

465
00:31:36,422 --> 00:31:38,248
Scott: No, he's legit like awesome Duke guy.

466
00:31:38,288 --> 00:31:38,870
Scott: It's like damn.

467
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:39,809
Scott: It's like I like that guy.

468
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:44,024
Scott: it's like I always want to see like the badass heroic actually good King like.

469
00:31:44,085 --> 00:31:55,750
Rym: actually if the story if Hue had not you a had not betrayed and the entire book was just Them trying to avoid the cat the trap that the Harkonnen have set that would have been awesome.

470
00:31:55,830 --> 00:32:01,419
Rym: Yeah, if the whole book was just like that dinner party and just kept going until they won I would have enjoyed it just as much.

471
00:32:01,741 --> 00:32:03,289
Scott: Yeah, actually and you could have just ended it.

472
00:32:03,681 --> 00:32:07,387
Scott: Yeah I do like even though that there are more dunes and clearly they play.

473
00:32:08,452 --> 00:32:10,502
Scott: Frank Herbert intended there to be more dunes.

474
00:32:10,542 --> 00:32:19,862
Scott: Yeah, right from the get-go You know because he didn't say everything you had to say in the one book It still stands alone as itself as a complete book.

475
00:32:19,902 --> 00:32:21,426
Scott: that doesn't feel like you need like.

476
00:32:21,466 --> 00:32:24,930
Scott: if there had never been another dune at All yeah, you wouldn't feel like you were missing anything.

477
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:29,526
Rym: That is a big difference from like other fantasy series like Locke Lamora the Wheel of Time.

478
00:32:29,587 --> 00:32:30,550
Rym: every book ends and you're like.

479
00:32:30,732 --> 00:32:32,250
Rym: I really got to know what happens now.

480
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:32,871
Scott: Yeah It's like.

481
00:32:32,932 --> 00:32:35,521
Scott: it really feels like there's supposed to be a volume.

482
00:32:35,581 --> 00:32:42,950
Scott: to a lot of times when there's a volume one even if they Didn't get a guaranteed contract to write a volume to it feels like the day intended for one from the get-go.

483
00:32:43,071 --> 00:32:45,242
Scott: But here no, this is a standalone book.

484
00:32:45,262 --> 00:32:46,850
Scott: You can pretend the other ones don't even exist.

485
00:32:46,932 --> 00:32:50,639
Rym: No problem And the end is actually solid ending pretty satisfying.

486
00:32:50,679 --> 00:33:02,959
Rym: like it's one of those situations of let's get all the characters who are important who are still alive in one room and kill some of them and then let's get them all in one room again whoever's left and resolve Every plot thread and they.

487
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:07,770
Scott: it's surprisingly that ending part The only thing negative about the ending part is it feels kind of rushed.

488
00:33:08,312 --> 00:33:11,670
Scott: Yeah, like it's like they get them all in one room and then everything happens real fast.

489
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:16,809
Rym: Yep, like how odd pops out and he was the only one where I wasn't a hundred percent sure what he was gonna do.

490
00:33:17,511 --> 00:33:18,535
Rym: Yeah, I'd seen at the end.

491
00:33:18,655 --> 00:33:21,385
Rym: Mm-hmm, but I realized I look back and flip through.

492
00:33:21,405 --> 00:33:22,630
Rym: he was set up.

493
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:25,301
Rym: You know, all the other characters are like what's dangerous?

494
00:33:25,361 --> 00:33:26,104
Rym: What's what up to?

495
00:33:26,185 --> 00:33:27,430
Rym: is he really on their her cone inside?

496
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:35,346
Rym: But if you read what he actually does he's just fucking with the Baron Harkonnen the entire time Waiting for his moment to betray that dude.

497
00:33:35,568 --> 00:33:38,236
Rym: Yeah Actually, I think my favorite character.

498
00:33:38,296 --> 00:33:39,942
Rym: I keep saying it's Keens or Kynes.

499
00:33:40,003 --> 00:33:41,990
Scott: likely it kinda think it's Kynes cuz it's a wife.

500
00:33:42,071 --> 00:33:42,678
Scott: It was Keens.

501
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:50,084
Rym: It would be ke a actually Really like and I remembered this guy just a second ago the Count Fenring.

502
00:33:50,706 --> 00:33:52,150
Scott: Oh, that's definitely a Rym character.

503
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:54,216
Scott: Yeah, that guy's totally like.

504
00:33:54,537 --> 00:33:56,905
Scott: oh, but he's also ridiculously badass.

505
00:33:56,965 --> 00:33:58,530
Rym: said there was a really good scene.

506
00:33:58,571 --> 00:33:58,854
Rym: What am I?

507
00:33:59,158 --> 00:34:00,090
Rym: this is also one of my favorite?

508
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:01,978
Scott: You know who Count Fenring reminds me of?

509
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:02,400
Scott: Uh-huh.

510
00:34:02,581 --> 00:34:04,790
Scott: Kefka like he's that he's that kind of guy.

511
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:08,226
Scott: Yeah, only less ridiculously evil, but there's that.

512
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:11,196
Scott: but he's also Aesthetically, he seems the same.

513
00:34:11,255 --> 00:34:12,360
Rym: Yeah, but unlike Kefka.

514
00:34:12,541 --> 00:34:13,324
Rym: He's actually honored.

515
00:34:13,344 --> 00:34:17,038
Scott: like if you had to draw a picture of him I draw Kefka like they could share wardrobes.

516
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:32,864
Rym: I imagine even though there's not not exactly the same There's that moment where I think he's talking to the Baron and he talks like so Baron Like he's humming and hmm and all the time and you're like god, what the fuck dude.

517
00:34:33,366 --> 00:34:50,420
Rym: and then the next scene is Someone like he basically like it says yes him and his wife Were talking in their private humming language and you're like, oh They were just talking to each other right in front of this stupid Baron's face and plotting against him And he didn't even realize it.

518
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:52,772
Rym: The Baron is not the smartest He's.

519
00:34:53,033 --> 00:34:57,370
Rym: he's not as capable as I expected him to be from playing the game.

520
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:57,972
Scott: Well, yeah.

521
00:34:58,032 --> 00:34:59,597
Scott: Well, the thing is with the Baron right.

522
00:34:59,717 --> 00:35:01,723
Rym: everybody was playing him literally everyone.

523
00:35:02,144 --> 00:35:04,170
Scott: It's it's weird and that he is.

524
00:35:05,171 --> 00:35:07,750
Scott: He's not like completely incompetent, right?

525
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:12,563
Scott: He's not like one of those like really stupid bumbling know-nothing.

526
00:35:12,603 --> 00:35:14,489
Rym: bad plan was pretty good, right?

527
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:20,229
Scott: It's like you see a lot of like I guess in a lot of kids stuff, especially where the bad guy is like bad.

528
00:35:20,792 --> 00:35:22,850
Scott: Yeah, Skeletor is a great example.

529
00:35:22,971 --> 00:35:27,550
Scott: He's bad and he's bad at being bad right or like, you know, Megatron like messes up every time.

530
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:29,535
Scott: Cobra Commander messes up every time.

531
00:35:29,675 --> 00:35:43,730
Scott: a bad guy who's actually skilled and really dangerous doesn't really do too much right, you know, but Here it's like yeah, he is a bad guy who is not nearly as good at anything as anyone else around him.

532
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:48,575
Scott: Well, even the person that he wants to be his successor is better than he is Yeah at everything in life.

533
00:35:51,871 --> 00:35:56,788
Scott: But he's actually I mean his plan to get Reno kill the Duke of what.

534
00:35:56,828 --> 00:35:57,510
Scott: I get worried, right?

535
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,061
Scott: It's like God, you know, he's.

536
00:35:59,383 --> 00:36:00,270
Scott: he's not completely.

537
00:36:01,011 --> 00:36:07,729
Scott: He's like actually has skills which actually is good because it just shows you how really awesome everyone else is.

538
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:11,460
Scott: It's like this really dangerous.

539
00:36:11,481 --> 00:36:20,570
Scott: this pretty dangerous dude is Actually chump change compared to all these actually really amazing Jessica or still gar or any of those people right?

540
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:29,283
Scott: Yeah, so it's like oh and that makes everyone in the book, even though there's not really any superheroes besides computer man Paul Arguably still got like some of the Fremen.

541
00:36:29,303 --> 00:36:32,807
Scott: so guys not I mean They're just super at fighting because they lived in the harsh desert.

542
00:36:32,928 --> 00:36:35,197
Rym: true Well, I saw the car but it's right.

543
00:36:35,217 --> 00:36:37,445
Scott: that's a another example of the same technique.

544
00:36:37,505 --> 00:36:47,270
Scott: right the sourdough car Are presented as like these ultimate fighting Navy SEALs space dudes of super dangerous and they were and they are.

545
00:36:47,691 --> 00:36:51,021
Scott: But Fremen kick their asses in like a fight like one.

546
00:36:51,101 --> 00:36:54,110
Scott: Fremen is like five is worth like five sourdough cars.

547
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,421
Scott: Yeah, so I'm just.

548
00:36:55,441 --> 00:37:07,388
Scott: I'm pronouncing it that way on purpose Although seems to her on the prison by using this relative technique where you show you present one thing is being really strong and then you present something else is kicking that thing's ass.

549
00:37:07,408 --> 00:37:11,319
Scott: it The thing that kicked ass seems so awesome.

550
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:15,490
Scott: And so it you know nerds love all these powerful epic dudes.

551
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:17,736
Scott: It's like D&D with everyone's level 20.

552
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:18,658
Scott: Oh shit, son.

553
00:37:18,959 --> 00:37:20,443
Scott: Get your nerd jerk off on.

554
00:37:20,463 --> 00:37:26,549
Rym: meanwhile based on popular media I kind of expected Duncan, Idaho to have a lot more screen time.

555
00:37:27,092 --> 00:37:28,097
Rym: Yeah, and he was.

556
00:37:28,298 --> 00:37:30,730
Rym: he was Indiana Jones and then he just died like right away.

557
00:37:31,272 --> 00:37:32,576
Scott: I think it's true for like.

558
00:37:32,736 --> 00:37:35,766
Scott: there's a lot of characters in here like Peter DeVry.

559
00:37:35,826 --> 00:37:37,030
Rym: He's just dead like right away.

560
00:37:37,251 --> 00:37:43,170
Scott: There are a lot of characters that have a name and it's a name that I knew even before reading the book.

561
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:46,142
Scott: For example Beast Rabanne is the one that comes to mind first, right?

562
00:37:46,363 --> 00:37:50,325
Scott: It's like dude, the dude's name is beast Come and he's like Beast Rabanne.

563
00:37:50,365 --> 00:37:50,910
Scott: that first of all.

564
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:52,449
Scott: That's as really nice to say.

565
00:37:52,911 --> 00:37:59,315
Scott: Like that you imagine just before knowing nothing about do and you imagine a character and a fantasy novel named Beast Rabanne And it's like.

566
00:37:59,537 --> 00:38:00,730
Scott: that's got to be awesome, dude.

567
00:38:00,951 --> 00:38:05,770
Scott: That sounds like someone the Kenshiro punches in the head a few times and takes like an extra punch to explore.

568
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:06,733
Rym: Is he ever in more than like?

569
00:38:06,773 --> 00:38:10,403
Rym: like you never actually see right any of him administering Arrakis?

570
00:38:10,423 --> 00:38:13,737
Scott: they talk about Beast Rabanne Like 10 or 20 times in the book.

571
00:38:16,633 --> 00:38:21,790
Scott: You only actually see Beast Rabanne like once and maybe twice.

572
00:38:22,011 --> 00:38:25,225
Scott: all he does is like talk to the Baron for a second and that's it.

573
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:25,828
Scott: and you like.

574
00:38:26,976 --> 00:38:27,641
Scott: then he's dead.

575
00:38:27,661 --> 00:38:32,381
Scott: and it's like There's such a big character, but you know, nothing about them.

576
00:38:32,521 --> 00:38:37,702
Rym: Actually like Peter DeVry gets a bunch of screen time You're like, wow, this guy is gonna be a big part.

577
00:38:37,822 --> 00:38:38,164
Rym: Oh, whoa.

578
00:38:38,204 --> 00:38:38,526
Rym: He's dead.

579
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:38,847
Rym: Okay.

580
00:38:38,968 --> 00:38:41,024
Scott: Yeah, Duncan I know this name keeps coming up.

581
00:38:41,044 --> 00:38:48,770
Rym: people keep talking In the later books, they keep resurrecting his like they use his DNA and they keep bringing like clones of him back.

582
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,075
Scott: Yeah, Scott Johnson's told us that.

583
00:38:50,095 --> 00:38:54,190
Scott: yeah, so that's why everyone talks about Duncan, Idaho, but no but not sound nothing about in real life.

584
00:38:54,231 --> 00:38:56,653
Scott: I'm saying just in this book Oh, he's Duncan.

585
00:38:56,773 --> 00:39:16,249
Scott: Idaho's name comes up as characters talk about him or think about him But his actual presence on the pages where he's in the scene Right where you see him doing something or he's actually doing something of note in the time frame of this story From the time they land on dune to the end.

586
00:39:17,334 --> 00:39:19,290
Rym: Not much Duncan, Idaho action really.

587
00:39:20,894 --> 00:39:23,059
Scott: I just imagined him as Indiana Jones.

588
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:26,187
Scott: Of course, Indiana Jones didn't exist when this book was written.

589
00:39:26,227 --> 00:39:38,120
Rym: Yeah, so I wonder how much Indiana Jones Meanwhile gurney Halleck who no one had talked about ever I didn't really know who that character was actually a major character and it's like one of the top characters Yeah, and he's also great.

590
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,068
Rym: Like I really like him.

591
00:39:39,129 --> 00:39:45,028
Scott: Yeah Well, I mean if you take gurney Halleck and you know, he has sex with fenring Rym comes out.

592
00:39:45,088 --> 00:39:49,683
Rym: Yep Well, cuz gurney came from one of those prison type planets.

593
00:39:50,064 --> 00:39:51,690
Rym: Yeah, so he's like that powerful.

594
00:39:51,951 --> 00:39:53,758
Scott: Yeah, he's a powerful dude and a bard.

595
00:39:53,798 --> 00:39:55,404
Scott: He's spooning and strong.

596
00:39:55,485 --> 00:39:55,846
Rym: Yep.

597
00:39:56,428 --> 00:39:57,192
Rym: We should let's go You know what?

598
00:39:57,212 --> 00:39:59,629
Rym: He reminds me of to the bard guy in the wheel of time.

599
00:40:00,473 --> 00:40:02,660
Scott: He just reminds me of bard guide the beginning.

600
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,647
Scott: I can find a fantasy 6.

601
00:40:04,647 --> 00:40:05,871
Rym: Yep bard guy I could.

602
00:40:06,253 --> 00:40:07,277
Scott: that's how generic this does.

603
00:40:07,317 --> 00:40:07,939
Scott: I could pick eggs.

604
00:40:07,999 --> 00:40:10,830
Scott: Are you thinking of for know what the guy that always named Scott?

605
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:11,646
Scott: What's his actual name?

606
00:40:13,391 --> 00:40:15,800
Rym: That doesn't help because you name like every first guy you meet.

607
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,045
Scott: that's not the magical girl.

608
00:40:17,647 --> 00:40:18,410
Rym: He's not a bard.

609
00:40:20,371 --> 00:40:21,596
Scott: It still feels like that guy.

610
00:40:21,997 --> 00:40:24,666
Rym: the only bard is in Final Fantasy 4.

611
00:40:24,666 --> 00:40:25,730
Scott: well that guy's too spoon.

612
00:40:25,831 --> 00:40:26,602
Scott: He's more like fenring.

613
00:40:26,744 --> 00:40:30,015
Rym: Yeah He's not that dangerous though either.

614
00:40:30,356 --> 00:40:30,898
Scott: No, he's not.

615
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,346
Rym: let's just go through all the characters because there's there's.

616
00:40:33,707 --> 00:40:37,924
Rym: they're so simple That you can say we can say like a few words about every character.

617
00:40:37,944 --> 00:40:40,194
Rym: Mm-hmm Paul Atreides It's just like this.

618
00:40:40,596 --> 00:40:43,990
Rym: it's interesting because he we get this sort of coming-of-age story.

619
00:40:44,352 --> 00:40:46,364
Scott: Yeah, there's a little bit of a coming-of-age story.

620
00:40:46,384 --> 00:40:47,410
Scott: is the main character?

621
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:53,030
Rym: He's the only character in the entire novel who at any point evolves, I think yeah.

622
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:56,562
Scott: But it's still like, you know fantasy about being a super powerful guy.

623
00:40:56,642 --> 00:40:57,124
Rym: Whoo.

624
00:40:57,405 --> 00:40:58,388
Scott: It's a super powerful.

625
00:40:58,428 --> 00:40:58,910
Rym: Perfect guy.

626
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:05,841
Scott: Yeah, we already talked about he has some internal struggles, but it's mostly the struggle of oh my god I have too much power.

627
00:41:05,881 --> 00:41:06,407
Scott: What the fuck?

628
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:15,256
Rym: I'll be just like ah I want to fuck over the Harkonnens and the Emperor get my revenge and I want to save the people of this planet But I don't want them to jihad the universe.

629
00:41:15,296 --> 00:41:20,130
Scott: Yes, and that's the one thing that keeps you I guess not just sort of.

630
00:41:20,731 --> 00:41:37,734
Scott: That's the one thing that keeps him tied to humanity and not just be like at first like you can really get you know Identify with him because he's yeah, he's like this, you know, right because he's basically superhero generic, you know what's it called the What.

631
00:41:37,774 --> 00:41:41,027
Scott: the thing where you put yourself in is the character the self insertion.

632
00:41:41,127 --> 00:41:49,817
Scott: yeah, right It's not Mary Sue, but you know the the you know, the dude one anyway, but it's like, you know He's the guy that you want to be right.

633
00:41:50,218 --> 00:42:00,620
Scott: and then as it goes on and has he becomes just sort of not a person anymore you sort of like You know and he's in less scenes Actually, like you see less of him as like he goes into the desert

634
00:42:00,681 --> 00:42:03,110
Rym: and when he acts is much more like you being happened.

635
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:05,419
Scott: Right, you become detached from him right?

636
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,664
Scott: Like what happened to this guy?

637
00:42:06,704 --> 00:42:08,170
Scott: He's not I don't know him anymore.

638
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:12,790
Rym: But then you get those little glimmers where he's like, oh no, it's yet another my friends become a creature.

639
00:42:13,011 --> 00:42:13,474
Scott: Yeah, he's like.

640
00:42:13,494 --> 00:42:17,031
Scott: he's like I can't let this horrible jihad Happen.

641
00:42:17,252 --> 00:42:21,729
Scott: it's like oh, alright, he's still like, oh, you know good person wants to.

642
00:42:21,749 --> 00:42:24,826
Scott: you know Even when he's like he's like my mom wants me to leave this jihad.

643
00:42:24,846 --> 00:42:25,549
Scott: I can't let it happen.

644
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,136
Scott: It's like oh look at that.

645
00:42:27,156 --> 00:42:28,802
Scott: It's like that's pretty that's awesome.

646
00:42:28,822 --> 00:42:37,430
Rym: Well, though you get the impression that still being herself Didn't really have the full knowledge of what the Bene Gesserit were trying to do and that was a Bene Gesserit plan.

647
00:42:38,071 --> 00:42:40,061
Rym: Her plan was somewhat different.

648
00:42:40,081 --> 00:42:54,430
Scott: She just wanted the best for her son, really You know, she wanted him to be awesome Duke and be awesome and strong and she did cake Harkonnen ass And she did actually legit love Duke Leto and Duke Leto legit loved her and didn't marry her cuz political reasons.

649
00:42:54,578 --> 00:43:00,630
Rym: Yep I'm glad that the plot of Every like dark the Harkonnen plant of the sea and everyone thought Jessica was a traitor.

650
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:10,476
Scott: I like how every character who was actually a terrific scene where he Gurney comes he's like you traitor and he's like wait actually We'll tell you how it went down.

651
00:43:10,496 --> 00:43:14,090
Scott: it's right away and he's like, oh my bad my bad.

652
00:43:14,452 --> 00:43:17,009
Scott: It's like how many fucking anime?

653
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:18,852
Scott: Other shit.

654
00:43:18,952 --> 00:43:20,216
Rym: that's ten episodes.

655
00:43:20,317 --> 00:43:24,550
Scott: people don't open their fucking mouth and just tell someone what the deal is.

656
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:26,213
Scott: Drama.

657
00:43:26,253 --> 00:43:30,390
Scott: and look we finally, you know, I'll give doing so much credit for that, right?

658
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:37,970
Scott: Finally someone comes in and drama is avoided in one scene because someone just tells someone everything right away.

659
00:43:38,618 --> 00:43:39,450
Scott: Good job, dude.

660
00:43:39,651 --> 00:43:43,905
Scott: Also all you people do in your stories borrowing from dune.

661
00:43:44,166 --> 00:43:45,370
Scott: How come you don't borrow that?

662
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:50,528
Scott: Yeah bother every other fucking thing in dune you steal from the one thing you should be stealing.

663
00:43:50,568 --> 00:43:51,110
Scott: you don't steal.

664
00:43:51,312 --> 00:43:56,765
Rym: Yep, you know you got the good guy You got the early bad guys who are gonna turn good and you got the bad guy.

665
00:43:56,785 --> 00:44:01,363
Rym: have those early bad guys Just turn good life three pages in right?

666
00:44:01,825 --> 00:44:02,507
Rym: Oh, oh, okay.

667
00:44:02,527 --> 00:44:03,190
Rym: We're on the same side.

668
00:44:03,732 --> 00:44:07,582
Scott: Whenever this good guys fighting give them a minute to talk and see.

669
00:44:07,642 --> 00:44:13,019
Scott: if they just resolve their differences when they air the truths and Then if they still can't resolve then they can fight.

670
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:15,730
Scott: right but don't have these good guy fights for no reason.

671
00:44:16,151 --> 00:44:21,367
Rym: Later to when Hawat because someone refuses to tell someone something remember her what out of nowhere is like.

672
00:44:21,627 --> 00:44:25,102
Rym: by the way, Jessica I thought you were the traitor and I was wrong and I'm sorry.

673
00:44:25,122 --> 00:44:25,947
Rym: then he died.

674
00:44:26,189 --> 00:44:27,796
Rym: Yep Oh, by the way, I have this poison.

675
00:44:27,817 --> 00:44:28,640
Rym: they were gonna betray you.

676
00:44:28,701 --> 00:44:29,223
Rym: I killed myself.

677
00:44:29,263 --> 00:44:30,750
Rym: instead you to dick everybody.

678
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:31,334
Rym: I'm out.

679
00:44:31,395 --> 00:44:32,563
Rym: He drops the mic and falls dead.

680
00:44:32,785 --> 00:44:33,530
Rym: Yeah, I like that.

681
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:37,410
Rym: I like how out a lot because he just played the Baron the entire time.

682
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:41,105
Scott: But yet again Hawat is a character who's there a lot in the like first few chapters.

683
00:44:41,206 --> 00:44:42,230
Rym: Yep goes away.

684
00:44:42,633 --> 00:44:43,559
Scott: You don't really see him.

685
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:44,929
Scott: you hear about him a few times.

686
00:44:45,332 --> 00:44:48,387
Scott: Maybe there's a scene where he talks to the Baron and then there he is at the end.

687
00:44:48,689 --> 00:44:50,399
Scott: Yep It's like where were you?

688
00:44:50,439 --> 00:44:52,089
Scott: people talked about you more than I saw you.

689
00:44:52,852 --> 00:44:57,950
Rym: I liked you a - because again because they didn't have the mystery, you know is the reader right away.

690
00:44:58,571 --> 00:45:00,702
Rym: He's like, you know, he is the betrayer.

691
00:45:00,742 --> 00:45:02,190
Scott: I think it's like maybe even page one.

692
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:09,815
Rym: They're like, oh by the way you a is the betrayer, but then the whole you keep reading and you're just waiting Like when's he gonna betray?

693
00:45:09,876 --> 00:45:10,859
Scott: How's he gonna betray?

694
00:45:10,919 --> 00:45:13,830
Rym: and you see everyone else and they add an additional mystery.

695
00:45:13,931 --> 00:45:15,989
Scott: It's like oh you a has this special training.

696
00:45:16,371 --> 00:45:17,494
Scott: How could he possibly?

697
00:45:17,554 --> 00:45:20,904
Scott: but this special betray training prevents him from betraying?

698
00:45:21,246 --> 00:45:22,630
Scott: How could he still betray?

699
00:45:23,131 --> 00:45:24,074
Scott: The special training?

700
00:45:24,114 --> 00:45:28,366
Scott: and then they reveal the reason that it he was able to betray despite the training.

701
00:45:28,406 --> 00:45:31,254
Rym: the power of his love was Greater than his conditioning.

702
00:45:31,394 --> 00:45:34,242
Rym: Yep, but none of the characters know that.

703
00:45:34,262 --> 00:45:35,566
Rym: it's all the characters like.

704
00:45:35,586 --> 00:45:37,914
Rym: there's all these infuriating scenes But in the good way.

705
00:45:38,216 --> 00:45:40,749
Rym: where people sit around they're like, who's the betrayer?

706
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:45,880
Rym: Well, it can't be you and everyone's like duh can't be you a special training Who else is it?

707
00:45:46,142 --> 00:45:47,150
Rym: and you're just like god?

708
00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:50,930
Scott: I just want to tell you people well because that's you have this narrator who just tells you everything.

709
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:55,184
Rym: But I also like how his betrayal is so just direct and simple.

710
00:45:55,204 --> 00:45:56,970
Rym: It's like oh, I turned off the shield and killed some people.

711
00:45:57,332 --> 00:45:58,078
Scott: Yeah, that's it.

712
00:45:58,219 --> 00:45:59,750
Scott: She'll stand on the shield at the right time.

713
00:46:00,172 --> 00:46:01,639
Rym: It's just literally the shield comes down.

714
00:46:01,659 --> 00:46:03,830
Scott: and that because the thing is they're so good.

715
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:10,850
Scott: And there's a little bit especially in that beginning part that nerds also love that procedural security part.

716
00:46:11,073 --> 00:46:22,250
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know You get a little bat from the ghost in the shell and such and such or it's like, alright We're gonna tell you every detail of how we're protecting ourselves and how we can't be betrayed.

717
00:46:22,596 --> 00:46:23,390
Scott: You know what?

718
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:26,409
Scott: You know and it's like and that makes it more interesting of like.

719
00:46:26,449 --> 00:46:28,844
Scott: oh How are they gonna get through this like and sort of like?

720
00:46:28,924 --> 00:46:29,850
Scott: oh, here's a dungeon.

721
00:46:30,252 --> 00:46:33,004
Scott: Look at all the traps in the dungeon how dangerous it is.

722
00:46:33,024 --> 00:46:34,289
Scott: How are they gonna get through there?

723
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:38,101
Scott: Yeah, then learn it, you know get the details of how to get through.

724
00:46:38,121 --> 00:46:39,987
Scott: is a shit that nerds love?

725
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:40,770
Scott: nerds eat that shit up.

726
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:42,603
Scott: Yeah, so there it is.

727
00:46:42,643 --> 00:46:43,148
Scott: They give it to you.

728
00:46:43,651 --> 00:46:52,910
Rym: So I like the Lady Jessica because she was actually probably the most complex character Because she had a lot of very different conflicting motivations, right?

729
00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:59,670
Scott: And then it's like then she has the baby and then she has the mistake with the baby But she's also has all these different phases, right?

730
00:46:59,830 --> 00:47:02,540
Rym: I like how instrumental she is like Paul would have just died without her.

731
00:47:02,922 --> 00:47:07,963
Rym: and anytime Paul a few times Paul's like I don't need you mom and she's like son.

732
00:47:08,204 --> 00:47:09,409
Rym: You don't even know the half of it.

733
00:47:10,773 --> 00:47:11,760
Rym: You think you know the voice?

734
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:13,090
Rym: Let me show you the fucking voice.

735
00:47:14,752 --> 00:47:21,845
Rym: But the only thing that bothers me about her and it's kind of a Because I read the Wheel of Time not that long ago and I read this what is with old sci-fi?

736
00:47:22,427 --> 00:47:31,209
Rym: and like male and female are these intrinsic traits of being that are like a big part of the fundamental reality of the universe.

737
00:47:32,771 --> 00:47:37,548
Scott: It's because dudes who wrote old sci-fi books didn't get a lot of sex action.

738
00:47:37,568 --> 00:47:40,890
Scott: Yeah nerds had a lot of sex fantasies Every.

739
00:47:42,811 --> 00:47:43,856
Scott: Haven't you seen the photos?

740
00:47:43,896 --> 00:47:45,505
Scott: and like the 70s sci-fi conventions?

741
00:47:45,545 --> 00:47:49,490
Scott: Yeah, right Those are really like half orgy half sci-fi convention.

742
00:47:49,791 --> 00:47:57,240
Rym: But at the same time I do appreciate that Jessica was a complex very powerful car Really one of the most powerful characters in the book.

743
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:05,149
Scott: I would actually say for a sci-fi book written at this time It was restrained compared to say a Robert Heinlein, which is what you get when you just let it go.

744
00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:06,359
Rym: Just let it go.

745
00:48:09,171 --> 00:48:11,679
Rym: Herbert was probably holding back all the things you expect.

746
00:48:11,719 --> 00:48:16,270
Rym: like Jessica surprised me a lot too because she was the one character with the most complex motivations.

747
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:17,835
Rym: So she would do things.

748
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:28,915
Rym: that surprised me and I don't think any other character surprised me at any point Except when Fen ring at the end was like no, we're cool I'm not I'm not gonna I'm not gonna fight you.

749
00:48:28,935 --> 00:48:29,657
Rym: We're good.

750
00:48:29,677 --> 00:48:40,070
Rym: I The footnotes we find out that he is like one gene short of being Paul Atreides.

751
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:46,650
Scott: He's super badass, but he I like how he retired to like the Grey Gardens with the Emperor.

752
00:48:46,892 --> 00:48:48,169
Rym: Yeah, the prison planet.

753
00:48:48,891 --> 00:48:52,935
Rym: They were best bros Aaliyah the little sister.

754
00:48:52,955 --> 00:48:53,016
Rym: Mmm.

755
00:48:53,718 --> 00:48:54,881
Rym: I didn't know anything about her.

756
00:48:55,102 --> 00:48:57,730
Scott: I never heard of her before actually one of the few characters.

757
00:48:57,811 --> 00:48:58,536
Scott: I'd never heard the name.

758
00:48:58,677 --> 00:49:02,857
Scott: I knew reading but was a little girl Basically gonna be.

759
00:49:03,318 --> 00:49:04,642
Scott: she's basically the magical girl.

760
00:49:04,662 --> 00:49:07,430
Scott: Yeah, it's like they like putting her in this book.

761
00:49:07,834 --> 00:49:16,857
Scott: It's like she did some stuff But really it's just creating her in this book so that she she clearly plays you know a large role in the future.

762
00:49:17,017 --> 00:49:20,812
Rym: her great scenes are just when the other Ben and Jess are at like the Reverend.

763
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:23,926
Rym: mother is like she's an abomination and Jessica's like dick.

764
00:49:24,268 --> 00:49:37,843
Rym: Yeah, and When she's kidnapped and she's sitting with the Emperor and the Baron and she's just sort of fucking with both of them It's it's like she's like a child don't like in the Prince of Nothing book There's the one young Dunyane during that one part.

765
00:49:38,205 --> 00:49:41,866
Scott: It definitely reminds me There are a lot of anime characters again that remind me of that.

766
00:49:41,966 --> 00:49:57,750
Scott: Yeah The girl the psychic girl in one punch man, or you know, there's a lot of those You know person who looks like a little girl or is a little girl But like you you imagine them like sitting on a fence like Humpty Dumpty kicking their legs and like sass and everybody.

767
00:49:58,491 --> 00:49:59,194
Scott: That kind of scene.

768
00:49:59,214 --> 00:49:59,414
Rym: Yep.

769
00:49:59,455 --> 00:49:59,675
Rym: Yep.

770
00:49:59,896 --> 00:50:00,679
Scott: You know that kind of.

771
00:50:00,739 --> 00:50:09,150
Rym: I like how the Emperor thinks he's got her as this powerful Leverage and tool against Paul and he's using her to mess with the Baron because the Baron's done at that point.

772
00:50:09,836 --> 00:50:15,003
Rym: but then she Starts scaring the Emperor and the Emperor's like, you know what I could do to you.

773
00:50:15,043 --> 00:50:17,440
Rym: and she's like no you won't you're gonna die You're all gonna die.

774
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:18,148
Rym: You're all fucked.

775
00:50:20,087 --> 00:50:21,238
Rym: Oh Wow, we talked about how like.

776
00:50:21,258 --> 00:50:22,909
Rym: we talked about that Emperor, right?

777
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:25,416
Scott: The Emperor is actually like.

778
00:50:25,436 --> 00:50:29,087
Scott: he's not like, you know, he's not super good.

779
00:50:29,107 --> 00:50:31,999
Scott: He's not super evil Like he's just he's an emperor.

780
00:50:32,019 --> 00:50:34,129
Scott: He's obviously like he's not a chump.

781
00:50:34,491 --> 00:50:38,730
Scott: Yeah, you know you think like, you know a lot of times you get an emperor who's a chump or something like that.

782
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:44,030
Rym: There's a reason why his family's been in power for 10,000 years and it's not just that the Bene Gesserit made that happen, right?

783
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:46,550
Scott: It's like he's actually pretty good at being an emperor.

784
00:50:46,670 --> 00:51:00,045
Scott: He's like really confident and you know, he's doing what he can do and the really only reason he goes down is because Paul too strong, yep, but I also like how He definitely has some honor and he actually likes the Duke a lot.

785
00:51:00,146 --> 00:51:00,627
Rym: Yeah, he would.

786
00:51:00,647 --> 00:51:08,650
Scott: he hates the Baron Yeah, he's forced into helping the Baron Yeah, but it's like, you know Fenring and you know Lido or like it would be his best buds.

787
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:12,950
Scott: Yeah, you know, it's just he's the Emperor so he can't be best buds too much.

788
00:51:13,771 --> 00:51:20,330
Rym: He's not really human anymore in the sense that he's almost just like this archetype all of that static society.

789
00:51:20,972 --> 00:51:30,482
Rym: So there's almost a side argument to be made that people like him like all the leaders of these houses They also lost their humanity because they're just instruments of this static system.

790
00:51:30,703 --> 00:51:34,468
Rym: Yep, like no one's human anymore in trying to remain human No one is human.

791
00:51:35,451 --> 00:51:38,146
Scott: Also, you know, it's pretty much like the guild really runs the show.

792
00:51:38,166 --> 00:51:40,833
Rym: Yeah Where's the guild?

793
00:51:40,893 --> 00:51:45,030
Rym: also as we learn socks and what they do, yeah, they messed up real bad.

794
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:48,202
Rym: They could have had everything and they're they're actually the biggest jumps.

795
00:51:48,242 --> 00:51:49,186
Rym: I think in the entire book.

796
00:51:49,688 --> 00:51:50,310
Scott: It's weird, right?

797
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:53,076
Scott: It's like everyone's bound down to the chumps But really they're just.

798
00:51:53,137 --> 00:51:58,466
Rym: ooh when Paul goes them in the end He's like I'll destroy it all they're like and you think like they're gonna be like.

799
00:51:58,506 --> 00:51:59,008
Rym: no you won't.

800
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:02,423
Rym: But they can see the future and they look at each other and they're like, ah shit.

801
00:52:02,725 --> 00:52:06,169
Scott: Yeah, you got us But that's the thing is big, you know that.

802
00:52:06,971 --> 00:52:07,572
Scott: That's another thing.

803
00:52:07,612 --> 00:52:09,217
Scott: this book does that nerds love right?

804
00:52:09,277 --> 00:52:09,497
Scott: Is it?

805
00:52:09,878 --> 00:52:14,190
Scott: it has this sort of this fake science magic system, right?

806
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:18,590
Scott: You know talk about this in Prince of Nothing also with the the gnosis, right?

807
00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:29,498
Scott: so instead of the gnosis is this sort of biological thing going on with how do the worms work and the spice and what a little makers that has all these hits that Water and that is it.

808
00:52:29,558 --> 00:52:31,805
Scott: How could we have not have even mentioned water until now?

809
00:52:32,026 --> 00:52:35,050
Rym: So cuz we're not from it We don't understand the importance of water, right?

810
00:52:35,710 --> 00:52:36,272
Rym: But the.

811
00:52:36,473 --> 00:52:37,056
Scott: so there's like.

812
00:52:37,076 --> 00:52:42,919
Scott: they created this whole fake biological system Which is basically the magic system of the universe.

813
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:48,392
Scott: Yep that for nerds to eat up on right and at the same time It's a really sort of like Like.

814
00:52:48,412 --> 00:52:52,930
Rym: there's the story's kind of like a spice and wolf is about like debasing silver and currency.

815
00:52:53,372 --> 00:52:55,142
Rym: Yeah, this spice spice and wolf.

816
00:52:55,202 --> 00:52:55,464
Rym: Mm-hmm.

817
00:52:55,625 --> 00:53:01,726
Rym: This book is about Like just basic environmentalism and like cycles and planets and things.

818
00:53:01,927 --> 00:53:02,128
Rym: Yep.

819
00:53:02,589 --> 00:53:02,730
Scott: Yep.

820
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:08,444
Scott: But so, you know, they tie that in there, right and by bringing that in.

821
00:53:08,464 --> 00:53:21,490
Scott: they created this sort of like dependent Cycle so that like yeah, they need the spice But it's like the guild is in charge of everything because they control the space travel Even though technically the chome company is right.

822
00:53:21,550 --> 00:53:22,695
Scott: Well, that's another we were talking about.

823
00:53:22,715 --> 00:53:30,490
Scott: the chome thing is the coolest scariest thing that we don't actually know a lot about Right, so that it's like but the spice comes from this planet with the Fremen on it.

824
00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:30,932
Scott: It's like.

825
00:53:30,973 --> 00:53:33,790
Scott: but so everyone's sort of interdependent in this circle.

826
00:53:34,231 --> 00:53:38,264
Scott: So no one can really just be on top of everything and just run the show.

827
00:53:38,284 --> 00:53:57,426
Scott: Yeah, and that's what allows For that fundamental structure that involves like this ecological thing Right is what allows for this political intrigue and wheelings and dealings of people trying to basically get ahead You know and get leverage against the other people in the same system, right?

828
00:53:57,606 --> 00:53:58,570
Scott: So you had a chome thing.

829
00:53:58,952 --> 00:54:00,097
Scott: That's the one weird thing.

830
00:54:00,117 --> 00:54:01,382
Scott: You have an emperor who rules.

831
00:54:01,403 --> 00:54:10,182
Scott: Yeah, you've got the land Noble you have been addressed or it's a sort of like Infused the entire galaxy with like their religion.

832
00:54:10,342 --> 00:54:11,065
Scott: ish in there.

833
00:54:11,306 --> 00:54:11,948
Scott: What's out?

834
00:54:11,988 --> 00:54:12,630
Scott: What do they call it?

835
00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:14,739
Rym: Oh, whatever that they like precede the religion.

836
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:15,785
Rym: What do they call that?

837
00:54:16,247 --> 00:54:16,910
Rym: I already forget.

838
00:54:16,910 --> 00:54:17,949
Scott: I forget what it's called.

839
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:18,833
Scott: But basically they went.

840
00:54:19,013 --> 00:54:24,090
Scott: they went around everywhere preceding like these knowledge in knowledge and superstitions into everyone.

841
00:54:24,251 --> 00:54:28,616
Rym: So some random been adjusted like when Jessica is just like, oh, okay I see how they treated the myth.

842
00:54:28,857 --> 00:54:30,987
Rym: if I say these words, they'll think I'm a goddess or whatever.

843
00:54:31,007 --> 00:54:36,486
Scott: Let's rock Yeah, and then you have the guild who controls all space travels.

844
00:54:36,868 --> 00:54:38,254
Scott: Yep, right So I get the.

845
00:54:38,294 --> 00:54:45,301
Scott: and then you have all these dukes and barons who are like under you know Like different Kings basically underneath the Emperor cuz they ever can't just run everything right.

846
00:54:46,525 --> 00:54:50,336
Scott: and then you have this lands dread And that's the noble houses.

847
00:54:50,356 --> 00:54:51,701
Rym: That's like the counterbalance.

848
00:54:51,902 --> 00:54:54,390
Rym: That's like old magnet pre-magnet Carta style nonsense.

849
00:54:54,550 --> 00:55:02,150
Rym: That's like the nobles who are ostensibly together equal in power to the Emperor and the Emperor nominally rules at their consent.

850
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:06,830
Scott: Yep, that kind of like the Commission of the NFL rules the consent of the owners of all the team.

851
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:08,656
Rym: Yeah, that's how they have the convention.

852
00:55:08,696 --> 00:55:12,327
Rym: Like if you use an atomic will destroy your entire planet.

853
00:55:12,347 --> 00:55:12,829
Rym: Mm-hmm.

854
00:55:13,732 --> 00:55:17,403
Scott: And then you had this chome company that everyone has shares in.

855
00:55:17,584 --> 00:55:19,490
Scott: everyone has shares in the chome company.

856
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:24,270
Scott: If you have enough shares you get like a. you get a directorship or something in the company missionary or protective?

857
00:55:24,491 --> 00:55:26,742
Rym: Uh, yeah, thank you Lord truck, right?

858
00:55:26,802 --> 00:55:27,626
Scott: That's what it's called.

859
00:55:28,149 --> 00:55:28,370
Scott: Right?

860
00:55:28,690 --> 00:55:28,931
Scott: So you have.

861
00:55:29,192 --> 00:55:29,553
Scott: it's like.

862
00:55:29,573 --> 00:55:30,276
Scott: it's like.

863
00:55:30,477 --> 00:55:34,110
Scott: so you're a duke and you have represented in the lands dread.

864
00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:36,790
Scott: Yeah, you also have a seat at the chome company.

865
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:42,750
Scott: Not all dukes do not all dukes do but like a seat of the chome company is the most valuable thing.

866
00:55:43,433 --> 00:55:46,146
Scott: But it's like and the chome company own the guild.

867
00:55:46,226 --> 00:55:48,920
Scott: not really There's a bunch of.

868
00:55:49,021 --> 00:55:54,190
Rym: even at the end when Is ready to be the God Emperor of all?

869
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:55,011
Rym: Mm-hmm.

870
00:55:55,051 --> 00:56:00,470
Rym: He still is like I can get guy can get gurney like a directorship in the chome company.

871
00:56:00,711 --> 00:56:04,125
Rym: Yep, like that's you can't just give him an entire paradise planet.

872
00:56:04,386 --> 00:56:05,270
Rym: You're the God Emperor.

873
00:56:05,531 --> 00:56:08,381
Rym: How dangerous is this company and what exactly does it actually do?

874
00:56:08,542 --> 00:56:10,690
Scott: and when I like there was one really important.

875
00:56:10,891 --> 00:56:15,790
Scott: See the biggest thing revealed I think about the chome company, which I'm sure it gets revealed much more in other books.

876
00:56:15,890 --> 00:56:19,810
Scott: Yeah, is that there's a scene very close to the end when the Emperor's already landed on the planet.

877
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:21,396
Scott: He set up his little temporary castle.

878
00:56:21,476 --> 00:56:31,950
Scott: Yep, and they're looking to see like what flag he puts up And he oh, yeah Cuz he doesn't put up if he puts up like the Duke's Lido's flag is basically acknowledging that Paul runs the shit.

879
00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:34,224
Rym: And if he puts up the hard code, it was an hour Conan flag.

880
00:56:34,284 --> 00:56:34,687
Scott: It's like art.

881
00:56:34,707 --> 00:56:38,201
Scott: Let's fight Yo, but he could have put up his own flag, I guess.

882
00:56:38,261 --> 00:56:42,035
Scott: but he puts up the chome flag, which is like All right.

883
00:56:43,614 --> 00:56:46,617
Scott: Okay So it's like who runs the who's like.

884
00:56:46,979 --> 00:56:47,300
Scott: is it just?

885
00:56:47,962 --> 00:56:49,688
Scott: who are the other directors of chome like?

886
00:56:49,728 --> 00:56:50,150
Scott: what the deal?

887
00:56:50,370 --> 00:56:50,733
Scott: I don't know.

888
00:56:50,794 --> 00:56:57,948
Scott: It's not super well explained Sinister and terrifying whatever it is and they even tell you what the letters stand for.

889
00:56:57,968 --> 00:57:00,364
Rym: I forget But it's just like a normal corporate sounding.

890
00:57:00,565 --> 00:57:01,049
Rym: You know what it is.

891
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:07,120
Rym: It's one of those mega corpse in like a net run, but there's only one of them Yeah, and it runs everything like what.

892
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:08,165
Scott: like what's the deal?

893
00:57:08,185 --> 00:57:10,594
Scott: Yeah Yeah, I don't know.

894
00:57:10,996 --> 00:57:12,441
Rym: so the Baron Harkonnen like.

895
00:57:12,682 --> 00:57:24,799
Rym: there are heel characters and stories That Frank Herbert went out of his way to make the Baron the most vile Possible being to make you hate him over Literally anyone else in these books.

896
00:57:25,362 --> 00:57:27,390
Scott: Is it fat shaming to the vet?

897
00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:36,422
Scott: It's like like they make him fat to a degree that requires science fiction Yep to hold up his fat off the grass because otherwise he can't want pedophile.

898
00:57:36,442 --> 00:57:44,150
Scott: Yeah, they make him a murderous pedophile And he doesn't seem to have any motivation other than selfishness and greed.

899
00:57:44,331 --> 00:57:54,430
Scott: yeah, he just wants fade to take over when he dies because he likes fad and Doesn't like anyone is why he just wants what he likes because that's what he wants cuz he's a bad guy.

900
00:57:54,751 --> 00:57:58,280
Scott: He doesn't have like a reason or any nobility or anything.

901
00:57:58,601 --> 00:58:01,188
Scott: He just wants power and money.

902
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:02,453
Scott: and What do you want?

903
00:58:02,513 --> 00:58:03,939
Rym: He kind of reminds me of in Prince of Nothing.

904
00:58:03,959 --> 00:58:05,384
Scott: There's the president of our country.

905
00:58:05,465 --> 00:58:06,188
Rym: Well, yeah.

906
00:58:06,348 --> 00:58:09,290
Rym: Yeah I was gonna make only way more confident.

907
00:58:09,892 --> 00:58:14,550
Rym: Yeah, I would actually rather have the Baron Harkonnen than Trump because the Baron wouldn't fuck up on purpose.

908
00:58:15,014 --> 00:58:16,929
Rym: Sure, like the Baron might fuck up.

909
00:58:17,251 --> 00:58:21,170
Rym: But look who the Baron would have succeeded if it weren't that he was the least dangerous person.

910
00:58:21,271 --> 00:58:22,429
Rym: It also the danger room.

911
00:58:22,590 --> 00:58:31,583
Scott: It also doesn't seem like the people who living in Harkonnen had any bad were like living a bad time Until the Baron spends all the money he spent.

912
00:58:31,643 --> 00:58:32,245
Scott: remember he spell.

913
00:58:32,266 --> 00:58:32,527
Rym: Yeah.

914
00:58:32,587 --> 00:58:48,870
Scott: Yeah Just It seemed like his kingdom or whatever you call it that a Baron has was actually not really the worst place But he spent all his money in his treasury to fuck up the Duke Leto the good Duke and then that ruined his own country.

915
00:58:49,151 --> 00:58:52,230
Rym: Ostensibly was because he wanted fade to become the Emperor and he had this whole plan.

916
00:58:52,792 --> 00:58:54,118
Scott: You know, there aren't any stuff like.

917
00:58:54,299 --> 00:58:56,750
Scott: I'm sure there might have been but you don't read a lot in this book.

918
00:58:56,770 --> 00:58:59,057
Rym: Hanet Ober advancing mercantiles.

919
00:58:59,238 --> 00:58:59,619
Scott: Sure.

920
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:06,190
Scott: It doesn't talk a lot about for example, like the Baron You know genociding his people or anything like that.

921
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:06,370
Scott: Like.

922
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:07,834
Scott: yeah, it doesn't seem like it was bad.

923
00:59:07,955 --> 00:59:10,602
Rym: You do see the slave pits and the fights.

924
00:59:10,682 --> 00:59:12,166
Scott: those weren't Harkonnen people.

925
00:59:12,748 --> 00:59:17,949
Rym: Yeah Well kind of like how in the Sardaric or Sardaric or Sardaric are occur.

926
00:59:18,270 --> 00:59:25,310
Rym: They the ones who survived the prison planet live like God Kings except that they are expected to die if there's a fight.

927
00:59:25,892 --> 00:59:30,850
Scott: Yeah, I mean that's you know, it's like alright look you're basically a God King when you're not working but your job is awful.

928
00:59:30,910 --> 00:59:32,959
Scott: It's like being underwater welder you get paid a fortune

929
00:59:33,099 --> 00:59:33,842
Rym: you might die and you

930
00:59:33,882 --> 00:59:48,790
Scott: might die in your job because it's super fucking dangerous Yeah, or like being a professional athlete Yeah during your when it's your job You have to train and do all this ridiculous intense labor for a very short, you know, 10 20 Maybe 15 years of your life, you know, it's horrible suffering.

931
00:59:49,172 --> 00:59:53,270
Scott: But when you're not working and when you retire you're gonna be the multi-millionaire.

932
00:59:53,451 --> 00:59:56,604
Rym: So I kind of liked Peter to ride like as a weird sort of like like.

933
00:59:56,644 --> 00:59:59,336
Rym: he seemed like I thought he was gonna be The square boss like the real villain.

934
00:59:59,356 --> 01:00:00,140
Rym: Oh, really?

935
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:02,330
Rym: Okay, then they just went down like a chump like right away.

936
01:00:02,531 --> 01:00:03,679
Rym: Yep, and that was just.

937
01:00:04,021 --> 01:00:05,310
Rym: he was interesting.

938
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:14,944
Rym: He reminded me of the assassin guy in the prince of nothing and he reminded me This is the original the Baron's original mentat.

939
01:00:14,964 --> 01:00:16,349
Scott: Yeah, right the one wasn't.

940
01:00:17,391 --> 01:00:20,249
Scott: He wasn't as good as who wants a whole lot replaced him.

941
01:00:20,470 --> 01:00:24,967
Scott: He was also addicted to spice and like super nihilist and I thought he was addicted to something else.

942
01:00:25,007 --> 01:00:25,710
Scott: That wasn't spice.

943
01:00:25,871 --> 01:00:28,481
Rym: No, you're thinking of I think oh, he's the other guy.

944
01:00:28,622 --> 01:00:30,348
Rym: you're thinking of Harford Nefad.

945
01:00:30,951 --> 01:00:35,130
Scott: Yeah, the guards addicted to that music dress the captain of the guard just like dies randomly.

946
01:00:35,411 --> 01:00:43,135
Scott: So the Baron just picks a new captain of the guard in a very Darth Vader and I was about to say Admiral neats Admiral.

947
01:00:43,435 --> 01:00:44,438
Rym: Yeah can Nefad.

948
01:00:44,518 --> 01:00:48,910
Scott: Yeah, but the admiral neat basically is addicted to some kind of drug.

949
01:00:49,612 --> 01:00:51,229
Rym: That's the Emperor something like that.

950
01:00:51,390 --> 01:00:56,430
Scott: It seems like it was basically like some sort of cyber drug where it's like involved movies in VR.

951
01:00:56,631 --> 01:00:59,885
Rym: He'd like take a drug and then listen to weird music at the same time.

952
01:01:00,006 --> 01:01:00,850
Scott: Yeah, something like that.

953
01:01:00,910 --> 01:01:02,275
Scott: That guy I'd be addicted to that.

954
01:01:02,455 --> 01:01:04,463
Rym: Yeah, that guy was not the worst like.

955
01:01:04,984 --> 01:01:12,450
Rym: he was surprisingly competent Yeah, and the things the Baron was mad at him for were not like the most important things.

956
01:01:12,719 --> 01:01:15,170
Rym: No Fade was actually the most dangerous to the Baron.

957
01:01:15,792 --> 01:01:19,967
Rym: The Baron's only goal is to make Fade the Emperor and the Fade just keeps trying to kill the Baron.

958
01:01:20,389 --> 01:01:24,377
Scott: Yeah like It's not fat and disgusting.

959
01:01:24,458 --> 01:01:25,845
Scott: Oh my god, my disgusting uncle.

960
01:01:25,905 --> 01:01:26,770
Scott: Well, he's in charge.

961
01:01:26,970 --> 01:01:27,392
Scott: I hate.

962
01:01:27,432 --> 01:01:33,009
Rym: it's just like ultra ambitious and that seems to be his soul like Fade didn't actually seem to be.

963
01:01:33,631 --> 01:01:41,664
Scott: Usually when you cease like, you know that story of someone trying to put their evil nephew or son into power It's usually the nephew or son is also evil.

964
01:01:41,886 --> 01:01:46,970
Scott: Yeah in this case It's like actually if he succeeded in getting Fade route that it might be better than the Baron.

965
01:01:47,090 --> 01:01:48,033
Scott: It's like Fade route.

966
01:01:48,053 --> 01:01:49,358
Scott: that didn't seem like he was bad.

967
01:01:49,378 --> 01:01:51,204
Scott: No, he's mad combat.

968
01:01:51,284 --> 01:01:54,716
Scott: He would use dirty tricks sometimes Well, but they weren't really dirty.

969
01:01:54,736 --> 01:01:56,845
Scott: They were just like yeah, I poisoned my other knife.

970
01:01:56,965 --> 01:01:58,956
Scott: cuz you know, that's how one I like out.

971
01:01:59,097 --> 01:02:02,396
Rym: there's that moment where he's like Pull poison me he's poison.

972
01:02:02,436 --> 01:02:04,524
Rym: Paul's like yeah, you also use poison you piece of shit.

973
01:02:04,665 --> 01:02:05,468
Rym: We're both cheating.

974
01:02:05,528 --> 01:02:07,494
Scott: Don't pretend Yeah, but it's just like.

975
01:02:07,514 --> 01:02:19,190
Rym: he doesn't really seem like a bad person by a generally objective moral sensibility But in the context of this fucked up society, he was by far the one of the least worst people there.

976
01:02:19,451 --> 01:02:21,219
Scott: Yeah, if he would he's killed and replaced his uncle.

977
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:24,152
Scott: it probably he might even just like stop, you know being even.

978
01:02:24,192 --> 01:02:34,686
Rym: but it almost makes you fantasize like if the Emperor and the fen rings and Fade and Paul and Lito were all just friends and Jessica like they could have run the world a lot better.

979
01:02:34,706 --> 01:02:37,115
Rym: Mm-hmm Uh, let's see.

980
01:02:37,135 --> 01:02:38,161
Rym: Who else did we talk about?

981
01:02:38,402 --> 01:02:39,166
Rym: princess Arulan?

982
01:02:39,186 --> 01:02:41,533
Rym: You basically never I got it.

983
01:02:41,553 --> 01:02:45,230
Rym: I got to talk about princess Arulan, but you like how you get all her right?

984
01:02:45,410 --> 01:02:50,808
Scott: Oh, yeah at the beginning of every chapter There's a little you know a quote from something right and a lot of books do this.

985
01:02:51,471 --> 01:02:52,213
Rym: Nothing does that

986
01:02:52,293 --> 01:03:09,869
Scott: sure but the quote the vast majority of the quotes not a hundred percent of them but like 90 plus percent are from some fictional book that's never been actually written and the author of that fictional book is Princess Arulan and you learn as you read these a few some number of chapters in.

987
01:03:09,889 --> 01:03:13,677
Scott: Oh Princess Arulan is the Emperor's daughter.

988
01:03:13,778 --> 01:03:19,512
Scott: Yeah, and she wrote a lot of books and apparently she's writing a lot about Paul Right.

989
01:03:19,753 --> 01:03:21,902
Scott: He knows Paul intimate and the whole book.

990
01:03:21,963 --> 01:03:23,790
Rym: All I'm thinking is when she gonna show up, right?

991
01:03:23,870 --> 01:03:27,505
Scott: It's like so, you know, there's a some princess named Arulan.

992
01:03:27,766 --> 01:03:35,150
Scott: She's gonna survive Lives long enough to write all this shit about Paul and she's super close to Paul and knows everything there is to know about him.

993
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:42,694
Scott: So as Paul's going along and this he's not even in the picture whatsoever except for these pre chapter Paragraph quote things.

994
01:03:43,095 --> 01:03:44,861
Scott: It's like when are they gonna meet?

995
01:03:44,921 --> 01:03:45,824
Scott: How did they get close?

996
01:03:46,025 --> 01:03:47,590
Scott: What's Paul doing with this other person?

997
01:03:47,690 --> 01:03:49,722
Scott: Does this person become princess Arulan like?

998
01:03:49,924 --> 01:03:50,890
Scott: because what's what's her name?

999
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:54,620
Scott: The the girl that Paul actually Johnny Johnny right is like.

1000
01:03:54,721 --> 01:03:56,546
Scott: is Johnny gonna become princess Arulan like?

1001
01:03:56,566 --> 01:03:56,727
Scott: what's?

1002
01:03:56,988 --> 01:03:57,670
Scott: what's the deal with that?

1003
01:03:57,871 --> 01:03:58,635
Rym: I had no idea.

1004
01:03:58,695 --> 01:04:06,970
Scott: and then at the very end of the book, it's like here's princess Arulan Here's her deal and it's like Oh Paul marries her for just to become Emperor in name and whatever.

1005
01:04:07,011 --> 01:04:13,115
Scott: It doesn't give a shit about her But she's just gonna be there all the time because she's out the Empress or so Whatever it is.

1006
01:04:13,156 --> 01:04:14,710
Rym: She seems pretty dangerous to like.

1007
01:04:15,682 --> 01:04:17,386
Scott: Way awesome and way good like they're even like.

1008
01:04:17,707 --> 01:04:18,710
Scott: oh, yeah, you don't have to worry about her.

1009
01:04:18,810 --> 01:04:20,255
Scott: She's just quiet and cares about writing.

1010
01:04:20,295 --> 01:04:20,917
Scott: just ignore her.

1011
01:04:21,218 --> 01:04:26,330
Scott: just technically married because that way you're marrying the Emperor's daughter Technically speaking.

1012
01:04:27,193 --> 01:04:30,184
Rym: So let's talk about the Fremen a little down fret.

1013
01:04:30,204 --> 01:04:31,990
Rym: So spice is just oil, right?

1014
01:04:32,210 --> 01:04:39,349
Rym: this is all like a really big metaphor for oil in the Middle East powering the international machinery of Capitalism, but what about them worms?

1015
01:04:40,430 --> 01:04:41,695
Rym: The worms are part of that cycle.

1016
01:04:42,097 --> 01:04:49,101
Scott: I wonder if the worms like it's even though they Even though they explain the cycle to you, right?

1017
01:04:49,322 --> 01:04:52,754
Scott: They don't actually fully explain Everything like.

1018
01:04:53,175 --> 01:04:55,403
Scott: is the spice a worm shit.

1019
01:04:55,885 --> 01:05:09,270
Scott: Yeah worm vomit Disintegrated worm, you know skins like like what like what, you know, and then it's like oh Well, if you mix the spice with water you get this other magical poison shit, and it's like how does that fucking work?

1020
01:05:09,410 --> 01:05:10,737
Rym: I think it's a much more important point.

1021
01:05:10,778 --> 01:05:14,409
Scott: There is this, you know, the spice smells like cinnamon So you just put it in all your fucking food.

1022
01:05:14,450 --> 01:05:21,630
Rym: It's like oh my god one like leotkien's and the ecologists and the scientists and the Fremen all understand how this works.

1023
01:05:21,891 --> 01:05:28,470
Rym: Yeah, and if anyone else had spent any time studying it they could have also figured out how them to study it.

1024
01:05:28,650 --> 01:05:31,338
Scott: Yeah, and they because they're providing the guild with spice.

1025
01:05:31,399 --> 01:05:32,983
Scott: they you know, they created this.

1026
01:05:33,304 --> 01:05:34,448
Scott: they create this.

1027
01:05:34,508 --> 01:05:39,644
Scott: the you know Frank Herbert created this structure where oh the guild desperately needs the spice.

1028
01:05:40,005 --> 01:05:41,410
Scott: the Fremen give the spice to the guild.

1029
01:05:41,651 --> 01:05:45,250
Scott: Therefore the guild protect the secret of the spice right and so forth.

1030
01:05:45,459 --> 01:05:52,337
Scott: Yeah And the guild knows the Fremen can destroy all the spice but because water is toxic It's really good, you know.

1031
01:05:52,357 --> 01:05:53,020
Rym: or to the make yet.

1032
01:05:53,060 --> 01:05:54,305
Rym: This is like the makers or whatever.

1033
01:05:54,325 --> 01:05:55,028
Rym: Mm-hmm.

1034
01:05:55,048 --> 01:06:01,530
Rym: I Suspect that if you make the planet habitable and livable the spice disappears.

1035
01:06:01,871 --> 01:06:06,565
Scott: That's why you have to make only part of the planet because there's already that other plot about hell.

1036
01:06:06,605 --> 01:06:08,350
Rym: planets make the most dangerous people.

1037
01:06:08,571 --> 01:06:09,253
Rym: Yeah, help.

1038
01:06:09,373 --> 01:06:12,764
Rym: you need hell planets to fuel the hell machinery of the society.

1039
01:06:12,925 --> 01:06:14,470
Scott: or you just don't make any dangerous people.

1040
01:06:14,752 --> 01:06:15,597
Rym: Yeah, but then you also.

1041
01:06:15,657 --> 01:06:21,730
Scott: but there are dangerous people already existing So they're just gonna run everything unless you make other dangerous people to fight them.

1042
01:06:21,832 --> 01:06:24,603
Scott: Yeah and it just so happens that we're.

1043
01:06:24,744 --> 01:06:28,840
Scott: the story was in such a situation where the sour dark hours are the most dangerous.

1044
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:30,988
Scott: people actually use their dangerous abilities.

1045
01:06:31,490 --> 01:06:34,380
Scott: and Then they encountered the Fremen who are actually the most dangerous.

1046
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:37,090
Scott: people just weren't revealing or using their dangerousness.

1047
01:06:37,472 --> 01:06:41,849
Scott: And then this is the story of you know, the beast is unleashed Here they go.

1048
01:06:42,091 --> 01:06:46,014
Rym: but there's also that very simple obvious metaphor of Spices oil.

1049
01:06:46,295 --> 01:06:49,204
Rym: people exploit the oil because it runs Lawrence of Arabia.

1050
01:06:49,445 --> 01:06:55,249
Scott: Yeah, he goes into the desert He comes back, you know and fight grabs the desert people in fights against the man.

1051
01:06:55,592 --> 01:06:58,553
Rym: But I like how leotkine seems to be Pretty like.

1052
01:06:58,734 --> 01:07:06,718
Rym: he seems like actually the most baddest ass of all the characters because in that dinner party scene He's like the one who's in the most control.

1053
01:07:06,738 --> 01:07:12,569
Scott: Mm-hmm You don't see them too much.

1054
01:07:12,801 --> 01:07:13,753
Scott: Yeah They don't do a lot.

1055
01:07:14,054 --> 01:07:20,149
Rym: you feel like they're cool and you're like gurney and the one guy one of the two like they hang Out and there's all these scenes with them.

1056
01:07:20,270 --> 01:07:25,230
Scott: But the one thing I do is like I want to say is that before reading the book, right?

1057
01:07:25,330 --> 01:07:26,309
Scott: Like I knew the word Fremen.

1058
01:07:26,370 --> 01:07:28,276
Scott: I knew the Fremen were the mysterious desert people.

1059
01:07:28,778 --> 01:07:40,423
Scott: but I got the idea before reading this that the Fremen were like literally Mysterious desert people like like you really don't see them, you know They're sort of like, you know cloaked figures in the dark and you don't like

1060
01:07:40,443 --> 01:07:42,812
Rym: the ale were for like the first half of the wheel Of time.

1061
01:07:43,093 --> 01:07:44,157
Scott: right exactly, right?

1062
01:07:44,197 --> 01:07:45,603
Scott: It's like oh, what's their deal?

1063
01:07:45,663 --> 01:07:47,530
Scott: But no, it's like this walk up like yo, I'm Fremen.

1064
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:48,213
Scott: How's it going?

1065
01:07:48,233 --> 01:07:52,190
Rym: Oh Lord Crunk is giving me like the details of this life cycle of the sandworm in here.

1066
01:07:52,491 --> 01:07:55,103
Scott: But anyway, it's just like, you know, it's like yeah, I'm a Fremen person.

1067
01:07:55,144 --> 01:07:55,606
Scott: How you doing?

1068
01:07:55,626 --> 01:07:56,470
Scott: Like right away.

1069
01:07:56,490 --> 01:07:57,694
Rym: Oh, you wanna know still see works.

1070
01:07:57,715 --> 01:07:59,602
Scott: Let's go as soon as they land on the planet.

1071
01:07:59,662 --> 01:08:04,739
Scott: It's like this that basically housekeeping Fremen lady and she just like mopey.

1072
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:05,643
Rym: Yeah, baby.

1073
01:08:05,884 --> 01:08:07,490
Scott: Yeah, maybe she's like, hey, how you doing?

1074
01:08:07,670 --> 01:08:17,064
Rym: And it's like, oh, I guess Fremen's are just out and about and then you get the backstory of the Fremen were a chaste Genocided people from somewhere else and were forced onto this plan, right?

1075
01:08:17,104 --> 01:08:18,450
Scott: Right, but it's super long ago.

1076
01:08:18,609 --> 01:08:21,421
Scott: But I'm saying like I had the wrong impression.

1077
01:08:21,441 --> 01:08:23,429
Scott: Like I had the right impression about Baron Harkonnen.

1078
01:08:23,670 --> 01:08:25,617
Scott: Yeah, you know I the only.

1079
01:08:25,858 --> 01:08:30,434
Rym: I thought the ramen would be inscrutable and they were just literally like well We're in the Fremen now.

1080
01:08:30,854 --> 01:08:32,560
Rym: Yep, Fremen from the Fremen.

1081
01:08:32,742 --> 01:08:34,046
Rym: Yep, the worms.

1082
01:08:34,287 --> 01:08:35,069
Rym: What's the worm riding?

1083
01:08:35,210 --> 01:08:37,678
Rym: No, they literally just put hooks on there at worms and ride them.

1084
01:08:38,059 --> 01:08:40,506
Rym: Yeah, like really straightforward.

1085
01:08:40,767 --> 01:08:41,609
Rym: It's not even magic.

1086
01:08:41,872 --> 01:08:43,850
Rym: Oh, if you hook it open it tries to keep it out of the sand.

1087
01:08:43,890 --> 01:08:46,308
Rym: So it rolls over on his back and then you're good to go like it's.

1088
01:08:46,389 --> 01:08:48,542
Scott: yeah It doesn't want to rub its hooked area on the sand.

1089
01:08:48,562 --> 01:08:48,925
Scott: That would hurt.

1090
01:08:49,066 --> 01:08:53,450
Rym: Yeah, if I got hooked I don't want to rub my wound in sand Even though I'm a sandworm.

1091
01:08:54,029 --> 01:08:58,149
Rym: Yeah, but I mean I'm a. I don't want my hooked wound to be like in out in the air.

1092
01:08:58,270 --> 01:08:59,758
Rym: Even I want a band-aid on it or something.

1093
01:08:59,779 --> 01:09:00,482
Rym: Mm-hmm.

1094
01:09:00,502 --> 01:09:01,830
Rym: I can like rub it against my bike seat.

1095
01:09:02,312 --> 01:09:05,426
Scott: Yeah, and it's like the worm doesn't really notice that there's like a tiny person on it.

1096
01:09:05,447 --> 01:09:06,090
Scott: It doesn't give a shit.

1097
01:09:06,674 --> 01:09:08,609
Rym: So I guess because we've talked a lot.

1098
01:09:08,710 --> 01:09:27,823
Rym: so the only other thing I really want to point out is that what I thought was really interesting is that So little is described in detail that it is very hard to visualize literally anything except for like a few people's faces and A handful of the devices that they use.

1099
01:09:27,944 --> 01:09:28,870
Scott: Yeah, like they don't really.

1100
01:09:31,470 --> 01:09:33,801
Scott: What's gurney's guitar thing called a balisette.

1101
01:09:33,902 --> 01:09:41,270
Scott: yeah, it's a real instrument about it Yeah, but they describe that balance describe him the ornithopter even like they describe it.

1102
01:09:41,350 --> 01:09:44,361
Rym: But I've seen so many different renditions how people drew.

1103
01:09:44,421 --> 01:09:46,990
Scott: Oh, yeah, they talk about like oh the the spice collecting thing.

1104
01:09:47,071 --> 01:09:53,633
Scott: I imagine it looking basically like the thing that the Star Wars again Jawas.

1105
01:09:54,075 --> 01:09:56,570
Scott: oh, yeah, I imagined it being like a big Jawa tank thing.

1106
01:09:56,751 --> 01:10:00,369
Rym: I imagine more like this giant scarab beetle just like scuttering over the land.

1107
01:10:00,594 --> 01:10:03,930
Scott: Maybe you know But it was big and they had it had treads and it was hard to get it out of there.

1108
01:10:03,930 --> 01:10:08,366
Rym: Landscapes and planetary stuff and like were described in detail and so are specific things like.

1109
01:10:08,386 --> 01:10:17,600
Rym: some still suit stuff But most things were described based on like How they matter to the people but not in any actual.

1110
01:10:17,620 --> 01:10:23,755
Scott: they would describe what a thing did what it was named how it moved But not what things look like.

1111
01:10:23,795 --> 01:10:23,896
Scott: what.

1112
01:10:23,936 --> 01:10:32,060
Scott: this is Lou are not a lot of adjectives and those sorts of words used to describe What things looked like what shape they were.

1113
01:10:32,101 --> 01:10:33,084
Scott: well color they were.

1114
01:10:33,104 --> 01:10:37,689
Rym: that explains why all the art I've ever seen related to doing is super abstract and weird.

1115
01:10:38,051 --> 01:10:39,336
Scott: I kind of like that our style though.

1116
01:10:39,456 --> 01:10:42,086
Rym: I do like the art style in the board game.

1117
01:10:42,126 --> 01:10:43,090
Rym: They have a lot of Hill board game.

1118
01:10:43,331 --> 01:10:44,578
Scott: No, that's all right.

1119
01:10:44,618 --> 01:10:45,322
Rym: That's good stuff.

1120
01:10:45,704 --> 01:10:48,982
Scott: Mm-hmm Like you serve for Dune art on Google Imager.

1121
01:10:49,002 --> 01:10:50,128
Scott: It's like you see a lot of good stuff.

1122
01:10:50,309 --> 01:10:53,868
Scott: Yeah So there's a movie about this.

1123
01:10:55,535 --> 01:10:56,398
Scott: I haven't seen.

1124
01:10:56,719 --> 01:11:00,210
Scott: people say like a lot of crazy shit about it and David Lynch did it.

1125
01:11:00,310 --> 01:11:02,279
Scott: Yeah, so positive or negative.

1126
01:11:02,299 --> 01:11:04,570
Scott: I feel like I have to see it for the same reason.

1127
01:11:04,630 --> 01:11:06,830
Scott: I had to read the book easy Thursday show, right?

1128
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:07,972
Rym: Sure.

1129
01:11:08,316 --> 01:11:09,450
Rym: Yeah, but people say it's bad.

1130
01:11:09,570 --> 01:11:10,534
Rym: But I still do this.

1131
01:11:10,554 --> 01:11:14,790
Rym: they don't know if they say it's bad because they love the book and it's not perfect or what?

1132
01:11:15,350 --> 01:11:22,601
Rym: I mean, I like a lot of movies that I also want to see that Joe Durovsky's Dune Documentary because I feel like that could have been the good Dune.

1133
01:11:23,063 --> 01:11:24,910
Scott: Oh, there's a documentary about the Dune that they didn't make.

1134
01:11:24,950 --> 01:11:26,598
Scott: Yeah, I heard about that too.

1135
01:11:26,939 --> 01:11:29,330
Rym: Yeah, I feel like we should watch that too and do a show on it.

1136
01:11:29,757 --> 01:11:30,409
Scott: I think you know.

1137
01:11:30,490 --> 01:11:33,400
Scott: But in a way does making a movie about it ruin the.

1138
01:11:33,801 --> 01:11:45,098
Scott: the fact that you used to use your imagination For all of these things that aren't described and how they look I feel like giving them an actual concrete, you know picture Right sort of.

1139
01:11:45,139 --> 01:11:46,189
Scott: take that away a bit.

1140
01:11:46,471 --> 01:11:53,115
Rym: I feel like if you animated it instead of doing live-action and made it kind of Really abstract.

1141
01:11:53,135 --> 01:11:55,644
Scott: the problem is you can't who you gonna get to do the art.

1142
01:11:55,704 --> 01:11:56,347
Scott: Mobius died.

1143
01:11:56,367 --> 01:11:58,787
Scott: Yeah Who's gonna draw it?

1144
01:12:00,031 --> 01:12:06,035
Rym: We've got to do a selective breeding program for 10,000 years to have the Mobius reborn Mobius quitter act.

1145
01:12:06,136 --> 01:12:10,748
Scott: I feel like Mobius is really the only art style that goes to Dune in my mind.

1146
01:12:12,111 --> 01:12:12,974
Rym: But I don't like.

1147
01:12:13,496 --> 01:12:17,510
Rym: I enjoyed reading this book like I don't have any regrets I don't you know.

1148
01:12:17,550 --> 01:12:21,269
Scott: I mean when I was young, I guess I couldn't even get through the first chapter and I said I didn't like it.

1149
01:12:21,389 --> 01:12:22,755
Rym: now I'm not like.

1150
01:12:22,895 --> 01:12:25,304
Scott: I don't think I'm not gonna say this is like it's not great.

1151
01:12:25,786 --> 01:12:26,750
Scott: It's not like my favorite.

1152
01:12:26,911 --> 01:12:29,122
Scott: I'm not a Dune nerd now or anything.

1153
01:12:29,162 --> 01:12:30,750
Scott: I'm not gonna read well any more.

1154
01:12:31,532 --> 01:12:36,286
Rym: Would have tried the next book had so many of you not warned me away from them.

1155
01:12:36,547 --> 01:12:42,275
Scott: Maybe maybe If I you know, but it's like It was worth reading.

1156
01:12:42,415 --> 01:12:48,011
Scott: I think if you're a nerd that you should read it, uh, you know for many reasons It's got a lot of great moments Like.

1157
01:12:48,071 --> 01:12:52,107
Rym: I have a 10 to 10 or 15 more of those like little moments that I really enjoyed.

1158
01:12:52,187 --> 01:12:55,945
Scott: but right I mean we've what we haven't even begin to cover like the amount of things that you can.

1159
01:12:56,086 --> 01:12:59,149
Scott: the book is large Yeah, but you can still read it quickly.

1160
01:13:00,091 --> 01:13:04,830
Scott: And because it's so large is just there's so many things to talk about if you have a nerdy kind of mind.

1161
01:13:05,514 --> 01:13:13,330
Scott: So it's fun, it's enjoyable It's worth like the almost no money it cost to buy and not a lot of time it cost to read.

1162
01:13:13,611 --> 01:13:21,070
Scott: Yep, but I can't say that this is like, you know, it gets credit for being like, you know, so legendary.

1163
01:13:21,351 --> 01:13:22,514
Scott: Well, I don't know

1164
01:13:22,614 --> 01:13:24,800
Rym: that may have not really been seen together

1165
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:45,449
Scott: and I don't know if the actual I don't I don't think it's actual quality is Worthy of its, you know legendary Hall of Fame status, but I think that it's Unprecedented nous right, you know and it's Its influence is what gets it into the Hall of Fame status, right?

1166
01:13:51,330 --> 01:13:53,870
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1167
01:13:53,910 --> 01:13:58,670
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1168
01:13:58,971 --> 01:14:03,990
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at front row crew comm for show notes discussion news and more.
