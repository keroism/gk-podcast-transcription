00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,405
Rym: It's Tuesday March 28th 2017.

2
00:00:12,405 --> 00:00:12,827
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:22,117
Rym: That's good, and this is GeekNights tonight America a party game where close counts involving Friedman Freese.

4
00:00:23,244 --> 00:00:24,277
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:40,608
Rym: So you know After several Nintendo things ago I agreed and I said very openly on GeekNights that Nintendo had moved at least for now from a buy site Unseen company to a wait and see company.

6
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:44,038
Rym: So when the switch was announced and we could pre-order it.

7
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,144
Rym: I Chose not to pre-order it.

8
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:49,253
Rym: to wait and see I saw.

9
00:00:49,313 --> 00:00:57,724
Scott: well, this is all the game in my life I have played and beaten every single player Zelda game except Majora's Mask, do you?

10
00:00:57,824 --> 00:00:59,549
Rym: I guess you're not counting the CDI games either.

11
00:00:59,769 --> 00:01:10,103
Scott: No, but I'm counting all the real made developed by Nintendo even Capcom Single-player official mainline Zelda game.

12
00:01:10,163 --> 00:01:26,337
Scott: so the ones on the GV the GV the GVA the DS but not CDI or NES SNES N64 no game of cube We and and now the Wii U one is the same as the the switch one.

13
00:01:26,397 --> 00:01:27,199
Scott: So switch one.

14
00:01:28,362 --> 00:01:38,760
Rym: But I true my word I waited and saw and everyone else is playing Zelda cooking food Taving horses and no other games and having a real good time.

15
00:01:38,901 --> 00:01:41,439
Scott: Actually, you should buy the snippy clip game so I don't have to buy it.

16
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:45,760
Rym: Uh, yeah I almost want to get one to switch because I feel like it would get brought out of parties.

17
00:01:46,002 --> 00:01:48,000
Rym: But I've seen real mixed reviews.

18
00:01:48,181 --> 00:01:52,859
Scott: I watched Gabe and Tyco play one to switch and I said wow, that would be fun for like 10 minutes.

19
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,908
Scott: It's not worth 50 fucking dollars.

20
00:01:54,928 --> 00:02:01,057
Rym: You know what it would be fun for 10 minutes or 10 dollars But not 50 minutes or 50 dollars.

21
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:08,003
Rym: Nope So I feel like it would have the same scenario that the Wario were on the We had.

22
00:02:08,064 --> 00:02:14,520
Scott: I will however, there is a blaster master game out for it and that blaster master game I heard is co-op.

23
00:02:15,425 --> 00:02:16,934
Scott: So yeah, we should do that.

24
00:02:16,954 --> 00:02:17,719
Rym: I'd be into that.

25
00:02:18,747 --> 00:02:20,360
Rym: I've been buying my games on Amazon.

26
00:02:20,721 --> 00:02:24,816
Scott: We could like what we could like stream it for like an hour after each podcast or whatever.

27
00:02:24,836 --> 00:02:25,940
Rym: That's actually a pretty good idea.

28
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,305
Scott: I'll bring my pro con.

29
00:02:27,686 --> 00:02:31,480
Rym: Yeah, but yeah, so of course I realized that.

30
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,243
Rym: yeah What have I done?

31
00:02:32,263 --> 00:02:33,367
Rym: I've made a terrible mistake.

32
00:02:33,407 --> 00:02:36,600
Rym: And of course the Wii U was the Wii U. the switch was sold out everywhere.

33
00:02:37,321 --> 00:02:46,500
Rym: So I had one on release day because I just waited a little while and then it was back in stock on Amazon And I just bought it with next day delivery and was immediately playing Zelda.

34
00:02:47,261 --> 00:02:53,693
Scott: There's no reason to wait in line or go anywhere Right, and we're not shilling for Amazon.

35
00:02:53,754 --> 00:02:57,812
Scott: Amazon doesn't pay us anything Except for the affiliate program, which anyone can do.

36
00:02:57,892 --> 00:02:58,434
Scott: it's not like.

37
00:02:58,535 --> 00:02:59,680
Scott: they came to us with that.

38
00:02:59,761 --> 00:03:01,213
Scott: I went to you know, I just signed up.

39
00:03:01,274 --> 00:03:04,327
Scott: It's just the thing And we make like no money on that.

40
00:03:04,407 --> 00:03:05,814
Rym: Anyway, well partly cuz.

41
00:03:05,834 --> 00:03:06,638
Rym: yeah, I don't have like.

42
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:09,353
Rym: I Haven't made links whenever I linked to this stuff.

43
00:03:09,373 --> 00:03:10,359
Rym: Like I don't make the link.

44
00:03:10,641 --> 00:03:15,027
Scott: Yeah, we get like if you buy the book club book from the link on our website We get like what 50 cents.

45
00:03:15,067 --> 00:03:16,739
Rym: so it sold out again.

46
00:03:17,443 --> 00:03:17,997
Scott: That's a shame.

47
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:25,666
Rym: But of course I just have it and a lot of people were complaining to me when I said hey It's just on sale and I just bought it.

48
00:03:25,947 --> 00:03:26,869
Rym: They were like bullshit.

49
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:27,330
Rym: No, it isn't.

50
00:03:28,372 --> 00:03:31,622
Rym: It only showed up as in stock to people who have Amazon Prime.

51
00:03:31,822 --> 00:03:32,284
Scott: take that.

52
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,290
Rym: Yeah, that's what happens.

53
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:35,153
Scott: That's what happened.

54
00:03:35,735 --> 00:03:43,799
Rym: So, uh, yeah, it's pretty great and I've only beaten like nine shrines The world of that game super dangerous.

55
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:48,010
Rym: I really like the way that cooking is portrayed.

56
00:03:48,475 --> 00:03:49,688
Scott: Where do you see a line now?

57
00:03:51,312 --> 00:03:53,280
Rym: I already I've run into a lot of situations.

58
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,368
Rym: I'm like that looks like some kind of moblin.

59
00:03:55,388 --> 00:03:56,936
Rym: ask dude I can probably take it.

60
00:03:57,017 --> 00:03:58,566
Rym: Whoa one hit insta-death.

61
00:03:58,607 --> 00:04:02,630
Scott: Yeah that whoa Anything that looks like a moblin or a lizard I can take anything.

62
00:04:03,272 --> 00:04:07,465
Scott: But no, I can actually if you encountered any things with lasers coming out of there.

63
00:04:07,505 --> 00:04:08,910
Rym: Yeah, I encountered a few of those.

64
00:04:09,191 --> 00:04:12,364
Scott: Yeah, I actually beat a few of those most my most recent play.

65
00:04:12,384 --> 00:04:16,339
Scott: I smashed some of those Yep, with with great care though.

66
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:16,860
Scott: I had to be.

67
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,752
Scott: it wasn't like I was so strong that I could just take them Right.

68
00:04:19,873 --> 00:04:21,630
Scott: It's like I had to be tricky.

69
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:22,734
Rym: I beat a camp cuz.

70
00:04:22,774 --> 00:04:24,099
Rym: I'm pretty weak-ass in the game.

71
00:04:24,179 --> 00:04:27,030
Rym: Like the enhanced lizard spear is a pretty fucking great weapon.

72
00:04:27,231 --> 00:04:29,889
Scott: Yeah, that's basically a stick with a nail in it.

73
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:36,430
Rym: But uh, I saw a bunch of dudes who are war would could one shot me with that and they were down like on a beach.

74
00:04:36,751 --> 00:04:42,588
Rym: So I stood up on a hill and spent five minutes just rolling bombs down at him till I eventually killed.

75
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:45,036
Rym: everybody Picked up all their sweet-ass weapons.

76
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:54,286
Rym: Mmm I also encountered apparently Team Rocket exists those ninja type dudes.

77
00:04:54,507 --> 00:04:55,590
Scott: Yeah, I still know what their deal is.

78
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:59,870
Rym: Yeah, I don't know what their deal is, but I'm pretty sure wherever they live is where the bananas are.

79
00:05:00,211 --> 00:05:01,557
Scott: Yeah, I want to find them and kill them.

80
00:05:01,637 --> 00:05:04,450
Scott: Yeah, cuz those guys all bombs down the hill at their village.

81
00:05:04,691 --> 00:05:08,509
Rym: Yeah that village if I find once I find out where you live you guys are done.

82
00:05:09,691 --> 00:05:10,794
Rym: But yeah, this game's real good.

83
00:05:10,855 --> 00:05:12,079
Rym: You should get a switch and play this game.

84
00:05:12,681 --> 00:05:19,789
Rym: If you don't have it isn't a $400 game Yeah, but I there's gonna be a few other games on the switch.

85
00:05:19,809 --> 00:05:23,998
Rym: and Also, the switch is a pretty good console so far.

86
00:05:24,098 --> 00:05:27,690
Rym: So no review yet, but I bought a switch and Scott bought a switch.

87
00:05:28,113 --> 00:05:36,758
Rym: This is the first time Ever that Scott and I both owned a non portable console You know because we lived in the same place.

88
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:37,702
Scott: We just get one.

89
00:05:37,742 --> 00:05:42,422
Scott: we didn't need to reason to game of cubes Yeah, but it was always me buying those wheeze in a game again.

90
00:05:42,482 --> 00:05:46,552
Scott: It was it was Yeah Cuz.

91
00:05:46,652 --> 00:05:49,182
Scott: I remember back when you should buy me a computer.

92
00:05:49,523 --> 00:05:50,186
Rym: back when the n64 came out.

93
00:05:51,797 --> 00:05:58,730
Rym: I remember thinking to myself This is kind of a bullshit console And I'm just gonna throw myself a hundred percent into PC gaming for the rest of my life.

94
00:05:59,131 --> 00:06:02,950
Rym: And I didn't resume buying Nintendo stuff until the DS.

95
00:06:03,971 --> 00:06:05,173
Rym: No, GBA GBA DS.

96
00:06:05,614 --> 00:06:08,159
Rym: Those are the two things but no mainline console.

97
00:06:08,179 --> 00:06:08,841
Rym: now until the switch.

98
00:06:10,123 --> 00:06:27,032
Rym: I By the time we split our domiciles, I no longer needed a GameCube Because the GameCube at this point exists solely to play Rampart which we could do on MAME if we really want to I guess or WarioWare.

99
00:06:27,052 --> 00:06:29,482
Scott: there's a lot of games to play in Game of Cube f-zero.

100
00:06:29,502 --> 00:06:32,153
Rym: Oh, yeah that f-zero That is lit.

101
00:06:32,193 --> 00:06:34,663
Rym: That is the best f-zero has ever been.

102
00:06:34,724 --> 00:06:41,090
Scott: I have many GameCube games In my little binder that are not available on any other thing easily.

103
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:48,570
Rym: Yeah, if I had a rank NES consoles or NES Nintendo consoles, I think it would be SNES NES GameCube switch.

104
00:06:49,194 --> 00:06:50,585
Scott: Yeah, the real Smash Brothers.

105
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:54,980
Rym: Yeah So I'm one yani gaming news.

106
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:56,906
Scott: Yeah, so this big deal going on.

107
00:06:57,448 --> 00:07:00,313
Scott: is the Starcraft Remastered?

108
00:07:00,373 --> 00:07:00,534
Scott: right?

109
00:07:00,574 --> 00:07:09,315
Scott: so Blizzard has been doing this trying to milk their old games for money for which we've we said in a panel And we did a PAX prime and like why you no do this 2010?

110
00:07:09,315 --> 00:07:10,709
Rym: Literally they should do this.

111
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:13,579
Rym: We like basically everything we've said people should do in that panel.

112
00:07:14,061 --> 00:07:16,710
Rym: as of this like 90% of that panel has come to pass.

113
00:07:17,011 --> 00:07:20,770
Scott: So on the one hand it seems good and the other hand it seems a bad, right?

114
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:26,370
Scott: So in the good part is like hey old Starcraft is gonna be zero fucking dollars.

115
00:07:26,591 --> 00:07:32,210
Scott: They were charging money for real Starcraft up until now and now they're gonna give you real Starcraft for nothing.

116
00:07:32,431 --> 00:07:37,668
Scott: Not bad, which is good for anyone who doesn't already have real Starcraft, but I fucking paid money for real Starcraft.

117
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,878
Scott: at some point I forget yeah, god damn it.

118
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:40,441
Scott: You assholes.

119
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:41,084
Scott: I could have waited.

120
00:07:41,124 --> 00:07:45,400
Scott: I didn't need to pay for that Even though I suck at.

121
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,650
Scott: RTS is big time.

122
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,238
Scott: I actually really like single-player Starcraft.

123
00:07:49,258 --> 00:07:51,566
Scott: Starcraft 2 yeah, and the plot and such.

124
00:07:51,747 --> 00:07:52,851
Scott: it's like Starcraft 2.

125
00:07:52,851 --> 00:07:58,885
Scott: I played on like mega easy mode Went through the campaigns which are fun and saw the plots and things.

126
00:07:58,925 --> 00:08:00,835
Scott: I think it might be one expansion still I didn't do.

127
00:08:00,896 --> 00:08:07,530
Scott: I might do that at some point Probably post Zelda world because it usually only takes like a day or two to do the whole campaign or whatever right?

128
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:08,120
Scott: But it's worth it.

129
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,001
Scott: But anyway, so here's what they're doing.

130
00:08:11,804 --> 00:08:12,729
Scott: old Starcraft is free.

131
00:08:13,614 --> 00:08:15,889
Scott: They're gonna patch old Starcraft for free.

132
00:08:16,271 --> 00:08:20,250
Scott: You don't have to put in this patch if you don't want to because if you're some Starcraft purist.

133
00:08:21,015 --> 00:08:28,863
Scott: but what all the patch does is basically Allow you to connect to people using the new Starcraft.

134
00:08:28,943 --> 00:08:30,889
Scott: That's how compatible the new one is gonna be.

135
00:08:32,732 --> 00:08:33,034
Scott: Right?

136
00:08:33,316 --> 00:08:36,232
Scott: it doesn't change the mechanics in any way Right?

137
00:08:36,273 --> 00:08:40,164
Scott: they're just allowing you to play on the internet against people using the new Starcraft.

138
00:08:40,203 --> 00:08:47,506
Scott: the new Starcraft is really the exact same goddamn Game just looking fancy so you can you play the old one for free or the new look fancy.

139
00:08:47,526 --> 00:08:50,658
Scott: looking one for not freeze The new rush 20 guys right?

140
00:08:50,698 --> 00:08:51,120
Scott: so the new.

141
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,940
Scott: imagine if like you could play counter-strike against someone But you were using like modern textures.

142
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:01,409
Scott: the other person had blocky old CS 1.0 people And you could just play against each other because it's still the same game.

143
00:09:01,831 --> 00:09:02,493
Scott: This is like.

144
00:09:03,034 --> 00:09:11,727
Scott: it's annoying though because does that mean you're not gonna get like the user interface improvements of Starcraft 2 To go along with the graphical improvements.

145
00:09:11,807 --> 00:09:12,250
Scott: I don't know.

146
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:15,402
Scott: I really wish you could get those graphic user interface improvements.

147
00:09:15,843 --> 00:09:22,790
Scott: the other question is if you're playing online Serious competition is it unfair that you have those user interface improvements, and it's different?

148
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:23,111
Scott: You know?

149
00:09:23,191 --> 00:09:23,774
Scott: is that really?

150
00:09:23,794 --> 00:09:31,289
Scott: are they gonna disable those and you play it competitively so that even though you have fancy graphics You're still limited to like the way you had to control Starcraft?

151
00:09:31,511 --> 00:09:36,256
Rym: You could you have the same questions about doom like all that There's like controlling the stupid worker.

152
00:09:36,296 --> 00:09:41,151
Scott: guys in Starcraft 1 sucks way more than in Starcraft 2.

153
00:09:41,151 --> 00:09:46,170
Scott: Yeah, they come out of the base and just automatically start working, and you don't like keep clicking on right.

154
00:09:46,471 --> 00:09:47,134
Scott: You know I hope that.

155
00:09:47,395 --> 00:09:48,781
Scott: are they gonna change that kind of stuff.

156
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:50,329
Scott: It doesn't seem like they are.

157
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:56,719
Rym: well I feel like if they did the kinds of people who still care about the original Starcraft Probably actually care about the clicking.

158
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,724
Scott: they care about that a lot.

159
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:02,539
Scott: Yeah, that's why it's important anyway And also for you know for competition to be fair.

160
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:07,298
Scott: even though I prefer not the clicking be I prefer the new way better As someone who sucks.

161
00:10:07,882 --> 00:10:11,610
Scott: obviously for it to be a fair competition You can't have different control schemes for different people.

162
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:15,369
Scott: It's got to be the same for everybody right whether it's new way or old way It's got to be the same forever.

163
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:21,510
Rym: Yep, listen seems to be pretty good in general about being ultra customizable for the people who care about that kind of.

164
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:29,650
Scott: Yes, so the new one is gonna be non free But I might buy it anyway because I actually never completely beat Starcraft 1 single-player.

165
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,478
Scott: I only got most of the way through the Zerg.

166
00:10:31,558 --> 00:10:34,390
Rym: I definitely did not beat Starcraft 1 single-player ever.

167
00:10:34,531 --> 00:10:36,103
Scott: I beat the tech I was playing on easy mode.

168
00:10:36,124 --> 00:10:36,910
Scott: right cuz I suck.

169
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:41,852
Scott: But yeah, I played Terran and then I played most of Zerg and not any protoss parts.

170
00:10:42,404 --> 00:10:50,049
Scott: so But the new one is gonna remaster like the story parts, so it'd probably be more enjoyable to see what's going on there.

171
00:10:51,558 --> 00:11:01,830
Scott: but also It's gonna give you like 4k resolution Widescreen aspect ratio because remember the original one is designed for 4.3 right and all new graphics.

172
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:06,129
Scott: So it should be way nicer to look at and easier to see what the hell's going on.

173
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:08,790
Scott: Maybe they'll even like redo voices or something.

174
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,195
Rym: Yeah, because I know that problem.

175
00:11:10,215 --> 00:11:13,970
Rym: what if you never used to replaying doom with the like upper-res?

176
00:11:14,171 --> 00:11:15,910
Rym: You know ports of doom over the years.

177
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:20,670
Rym: So if you play an old doom like it took me a minute to see anything in that muddy mess.

178
00:11:20,771 --> 00:11:37,978
Scott: Yeah, so if you never played any Starcraft ever Right and you it's something you should play you can either a get the old one for free and play it and learn about Starcraft B. if you got money and you want a better experience pay for the newer one and See if you're a competitive Starcraft player.

179
00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:41,089
Scott: You probably don't give a shit about what someone who plays on easy has to say.

180
00:11:43,492 --> 00:11:47,990
Scott: So whatever but You know, it's a good end of bad, right?

181
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:52,750
Scott: I'm salty that I paid for Starcraft where if I had just waited until now it could have got it for free.

182
00:11:53,611 --> 00:12:01,809
Scott: But on the other hand, maybe I'll go back and do some more Starcraft and just like finish all the single-player parts Completely after I'm done with all these other games.

183
00:12:02,751 --> 00:12:06,084
Rym: So as you guys know, I play a lot of overwatch.

184
00:12:06,124 --> 00:12:07,530
Rym: It's kind of my main game.

185
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:10,270
Rym: In fact, it only got sidetracked recently because of Zelda.

186
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:14,543
Rym: But I kind of got this urge just out of nowhere.

187
00:12:14,603 --> 00:12:25,690
Rym: My body was like, you know, you haven't done in a while You haven't played Counter-Strike in a while and Scott and I were talking today that yeah, like even though we don't really play Counter-Strike anymore I haven't played Counter-Strike in long.

188
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:31,993
Rym: We probably played more Counter-Strike over the course of our lives than many other games We have ever played.

189
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:37,889
Rym: quite possibly we played a lot of Counter-Strike for many years before we.

190
00:12:38,109 --> 00:12:42,587
Scott: yeah It's like you just play a little Counter-Strike a little Counter-Strike over the years and years and years little.

191
00:12:42,687 --> 00:12:44,998
Rym: I would play like four Hours a day in RIT.

192
00:12:45,058 --> 00:12:45,923
Scott: There were peak times.

193
00:12:45,963 --> 00:12:47,270
Scott: we played shit tons of Counter-Strike.

194
00:12:47,432 --> 00:12:59,512
Scott: But you know, I've been playing Counter-Strike You know on and off and on and off and on and off sometimes intensely every single day Sometimes not at all for years, but since beta 7?

195
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:01,861
Rym: We played before the p90 existed.

196
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:03,326
Scott: No, the p90 was there.

197
00:13:03,346 --> 00:13:04,851
Rym: They edited it In the year 2000.

198
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:06,537
Scott: the p90 was there the first time I installed Counter-Strike.

199
00:13:11,112 --> 00:13:16,410
Scott: But I was playing Counter-Strike at a time where I had to download it separately and mod Half-Life 1 to play it.

200
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,442
Rym: Yeah, we only got Steam and there was no Steam.

201
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:19,710
Scott: Steam did not exist.

202
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:20,594
Scott: There was only WAN.

203
00:13:20,655 --> 00:13:23,730
Rym: When Steam existed it existed solely to give updates to Counter-Strike.

204
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:27,344
Scott: WAN is the World Opponent Network and that is what there was before.

205
00:13:27,364 --> 00:13:28,347
Scott: there was Steam anyway.

206
00:13:28,368 --> 00:13:29,010
Scott: It's an ancient history.

207
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:30,175
Rym: So I go and I start playing.

208
00:13:30,717 --> 00:13:34,852
Rym: and the first thing I notice because I just jump into a random game like, you know Easy, whatever.

209
00:13:34,873 --> 00:13:37,742
Scott: You're playing Counter-Strike Source or Counter-Strike Global Offensive?

210
00:13:37,863 --> 00:13:38,726
Rym: Go Global Offensive.

211
00:13:38,866 --> 00:13:39,930
Rym: I'm not playing the old shit.

212
00:13:40,573 --> 00:13:40,794
Rym: Plus.

213
00:13:40,995 --> 00:13:42,342
Rym: Source is the worst.

214
00:13:42,502 --> 00:13:46,104
Rym: If you're gonna play if you want to play old Counter-Strike You wanna play original Counter-Strike or go?

215
00:13:46,145 --> 00:13:46,406
Scott: No Source?

216
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:50,365
Rym: Yeah, Source is like the middle child that no one wants.

217
00:13:50,385 --> 00:13:51,430
Scott: Is there anyone who plays Source?

218
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:53,275
Scott: Or is it like a dead game?

219
00:13:53,495 --> 00:13:58,210
Rym: Last I checked it was still surprisingly high in the list of games People are playing on Steam.

220
00:13:58,511 --> 00:14:02,905
Scott: But is it the least loved Counter-Strike or more people playing Source than 1.0?

221
00:14:02,905 --> 00:14:10,860
Rym: It was the least loved Years ago when I checked I do not know offhand right now I also heard like people still play Left 4 Dead.

222
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,050
Scott: I wonder how popular that is compared to old Counter-Strike.

223
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:15,222
Rym: Wow, I can't imagine what it would be like.

224
00:14:15,242 --> 00:14:16,428
Scott: Because it can't be more popular than CSGO.

225
00:14:16,992 --> 00:14:17,858
Scott: So it has to be.

226
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:19,430
Scott: but is it more popular than old Counter-Strike?

227
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:25,754
Rym: I can't imagine like what it would be like to interact with the people who are still playing Left 4 Dead in Left 4 Dead Like.

228
00:14:25,794 --> 00:14:27,080
Rym: are they just perfect at the game?

229
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:27,944
Rym: Like what what could?

230
00:14:28,165 --> 00:14:40,821
Rym: Anyway, so Already, I've played so much Overwatch and I haven't really played any FPS's but Overwatch that when I start playing Counter-Strike Stuff felt weird in this very specific way.

231
00:14:41,082 --> 00:14:43,550
Scott: You mean it felt like oh right the overwatch is wrong.

232
00:14:43,852 --> 00:14:45,361
Scott: Yeah, this is what right feels like.

233
00:14:45,401 --> 00:14:51,684
Rym: The guns, so the guns Felt really tiny and my hand on the mouse felt like I was.

234
00:14:52,146 --> 00:15:02,730
Rym: it felt like I was using up I don't know a spoon to try to do open-heart surgery Like everything just felt really tiny and fiddly and actually looked and started comparing screenshots.

235
00:15:03,396 --> 00:15:08,856
Rym: Everything Overwatch is enormous Yeah and the gun on your screen Takes up a huge amount of screen.

236
00:15:08,876 --> 00:15:11,907
Rym: real estate actually and the things that happen are huge.

237
00:15:12,228 --> 00:15:15,523
Rym: and in Counter-Strike It's this tiny little gun and it goes puh-puh-puh-puh-puh.

238
00:15:15,825 --> 00:15:24,213
Rym: Yep, so What's weird is that I kind of in some ways was better at Counter-Strike that I've been in a long time Really?

239
00:15:24,233 --> 00:15:25,679
Scott: You think it was the opposite, right?

240
00:15:25,699 --> 00:15:37,056
Scott: Yeah, but after you go around clubbing people It's kind of hard to do some, you know pointy knife fight, but at the same time Some of my like old Hesitancy and carefulness.

241
00:15:37,076 --> 00:15:46,922
Rym: I was a lot more reckless which meant it sounds like me two-thirds of the time and in a disaster Yeah, at the M5 But one-third of the time me and a p90 took out the entire enemy team.

242
00:15:47,223 --> 00:15:49,370
Rym: So just by running in gah.

243
00:15:50,612 --> 00:15:56,095
Rym: But the other thing was that the game sounded way Way different.

244
00:15:56,618 --> 00:15:58,186
Rym: So I but I wasn't using headphones.

245
00:15:58,246 --> 00:15:58,910
Rym: I said my speakers.

246
00:15:59,111 --> 00:16:06,310
Rym: I just assumed that because I have like changed computers and changed physicals A lot of stuff has changed that it was just the speakers.

247
00:16:06,951 --> 00:16:13,166
Rym: but then I switched to headphones and it still sounded weird and the gun sounded way different.

248
00:16:13,527 --> 00:16:19,916
Rym: and then I found this thread on Reddit titled from six months ago Why valve changed?

249
00:16:20,116 --> 00:16:27,283
Scott: the gun sounds what the fuck the gun sounds where I think from what I heard were Recorded from the original gun they were.

250
00:16:27,303 --> 00:16:28,770
Scott: I got like a fire new ones.

251
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:32,745
Scott: I went to a firing range with microphones and recorded the original guns.

252
00:16:32,765 --> 00:16:34,070
Scott: and that's what those guns sound like.

253
00:16:34,392 --> 00:16:35,782
Scott: So why the hell would they change them?

254
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:40,499
Rym: So they sound Way weaker and more muted.

255
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:43,550
Rym: Uh-huh, but they're not as blown out.

256
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:49,701
Rym: So those old gun sounds they're kind of they're a little bit clips Like they blew out the microphones early.

257
00:16:50,063 --> 00:16:53,990
Scott: because I'm like, I'm like listen Even though it was the year 299 or whatever, right?

258
00:16:54,070 --> 00:17:00,390
Scott: If you take a microphone to a gun range and make a you know, 64-bit 44, whatever kill her 40 kilohertz WAV file.

259
00:17:00,932 --> 00:17:02,639
Scott: You're not gonna really do any better today.

260
00:17:02,659 --> 00:17:04,767
Scott: We get the same exact WAV file technology.

261
00:17:04,827 --> 00:17:05,329
Scott: We had then.

262
00:17:05,368 --> 00:17:10,890
Scott: well Well, so I really sound like you can do a better job now because of logical reasons audio middleware.

263
00:17:12,311 --> 00:17:15,230
Rym: But does it can do a better job of layering the sounds in the game?

264
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:17,910
Scott: I mean like yeah, that's true, but a WAV files away file.

265
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:22,188
Rym: There's no reason to change the original Because the way there's a huge like.

266
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,079
Rym: Guns are way louder.

267
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:28,673
Rym: If you've never fired a gun guns are super loud Firing range.

268
00:17:28,693 --> 00:17:30,761
Scott: you wear big head earmuffs cuz bang.

269
00:17:30,821 --> 00:17:31,323
Scott: It's loud.

270
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:32,247
Scott: It's explosions.

271
00:17:32,307 --> 00:17:35,636
Rym: Like I don't care how Metal really hard.

272
00:17:35,777 --> 00:17:37,461
Rym: Imagine the loudest gun you can think of.

273
00:17:37,581 --> 00:17:41,110
Rym: I promise you it is way louder in real life than you have any idea.

274
00:17:41,632 --> 00:17:44,905
Rym: Even if you have like a silencer on it, it is even silence.

275
00:17:44,945 --> 00:17:46,210
Scott: guns are still loud.

276
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:48,690
Scott: They're just not nearly as loud as guns that aren't silence.

277
00:17:48,871 --> 00:17:55,510
Rym: Most microphones will not actually capture that full range from silence to the gun in a realistic way.

278
00:17:55,510 --> 00:18:01,010
Scott: Yeah, I guess at the time that they made those or even now because you there wasn't like super professionals, right?

279
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:07,102
Scott: These are some guys making a mod of Half-Life 1 for no money But also for human perception reasons.

280
00:18:07,564 --> 00:18:15,330
Rym: a blown-out gun sound Does actually sound more like what a gun would sound like to a human because it kind of blows out your perception of audio.

281
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:17,506
Rym: Cuz our ears are not that good.

282
00:18:17,707 --> 00:18:18,090
Scott: That's true.

283
00:18:18,432 --> 00:18:20,320
Rym: So they kind of sounded.

284
00:18:20,742 --> 00:18:33,427
Rym: they were bad and wrong But they were right in the way that a human would experience them if they were actually present when a gun went off Mm-hmm, but the the two reasons that appear to be stated as to why they made the.

285
00:18:33,467 --> 00:18:35,716
Scott: can you still I mean Did you still have a pro like if something?

286
00:18:35,736 --> 00:18:39,939
Scott: if you heard a gunfire in the distance and counter-strike I could tell you which Gun, they're sure you still can.

287
00:18:39,959 --> 00:18:41,712
Rym: in fact you can way easier You didn't.

288
00:18:41,732 --> 00:18:46,107
Scott: you didn't have to relearn be like those sounds it's still set clearly like oh that's an aug.

289
00:18:46,147 --> 00:18:46,770
Scott: they got there.

290
00:18:47,011 --> 00:18:48,740
Rym: I got picked it up again pretty quick.

291
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,002
Rym: All right.

292
00:18:49,122 --> 00:18:50,449
Scott: Oh, that's clearly the sound of the AK.

293
00:18:50,871 --> 00:18:53,341
Scott: The only problem was the M the sound of one a cake laughs.

294
00:18:53,361 --> 00:18:57,195
Rym: the m4 fooled me and I thought it was the weaker Whatever gun instead.

295
00:18:57,255 --> 00:18:58,379
Rym: Yeah, then I was like, oh wait.

296
00:18:58,419 --> 00:18:58,901
Rym: No, that's an m4.

297
00:18:59,001 --> 00:18:59,784
Rym: Oh shit thing.

298
00:18:59,844 --> 00:19:00,446
Scott: I never buy.

299
00:19:00,567 --> 00:19:08,230
Rym: Yeah, but So the rationale one which in retrospect I agree with and I think it's a good change.

300
00:19:08,811 --> 00:19:15,470
Rym: The gun sounds as they were both with the blown-out effects and their relative volume and how they were layered.

301
00:19:16,043 --> 00:19:19,870
Rym: however I don't know what audio middleware they use in counter-strike if they even use any.

302
00:19:20,351 --> 00:19:30,263
Rym: But all that combined meant that if you play counter-strike for more than like 20 minutes you get some actual like serious ear fatigue And then counter-strike has always been that way.

303
00:19:30,323 --> 00:19:31,350
Rym: That's just something you dealt with.

304
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:32,315
Scott: I never had that problem.

305
00:19:32,476 --> 00:19:34,264
Rym: You probably didn't didn't really think about it.

306
00:19:34,767 --> 00:19:42,750
Rym: ear fatigue It's not like it's gonna give you a headache or anything But what'll happen is you start to get lazy and start to miss a lot of other audio cues.

307
00:19:43,553 --> 00:19:44,858
Rym: It might also make you irritable.

308
00:19:44,878 --> 00:19:47,187
Rym: There's a lot of things that can happen with your counter-strike.

309
00:19:47,207 --> 00:19:57,730
Rym: makes you irritable but Basically the play experience if you play for long periods of time It's actually way better now because you don't get that ear fatigue.

310
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:14,230
Rym: So two hours later you're still experiencing audio and reacting to cues at about the same level You already first started as opposed to the previous days where ear fatigue would mean you might just miss Sounds like someone sneaking up on someone or someone defusing the bomb.

311
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:24,375
Rym: So it actually makes counter-strike a lot more playable and a lot more pleasant to play in the long run And it also makes the game more fair in that everyone has a better chance to hear Necessary audio cues

312
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:25,357
Scott: as apparently

313
00:20:25,397 --> 00:20:30,390
Rym: the pros are doing shit like having some people firing guns simultaneously when someone else starts defusing.

314
00:20:30,511 --> 00:20:39,154
Scott: Well, that's oh that's good strategy Yeah, but that's also kind of like ultra fiddly and also you gotta be pretty close to them in the first place to hear the Defusing right?

315
00:20:39,334 --> 00:20:41,142
Scott: You can't hear the defusing all the way across the map.

316
00:20:41,162 --> 00:20:44,582
Rym: You can hear it not across the map No, but you can hear it like around the corner.

317
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:45,650
Scott: Yeah close.

318
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:55,990
Rym: so The other reason that has been stated here is that the old blown-out sounds might have sounded really cool when you're playing the game.

319
00:20:56,492 --> 00:21:01,450
Rym: They sounded like ass on a television or a stream as a spectator.

320
00:21:02,015 --> 00:21:02,246
Scott: Why?

321
00:21:03,451 --> 00:21:05,338
Rym: Because they're blown-out terrible audio.

322
00:21:05,479 --> 00:21:08,450
Rym: So the same ear fatigue and stuff will happen for the spectator.

323
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:11,300
Scott: Did I at least give people the option to use the old sound?

324
00:21:11,601 --> 00:21:11,862
Scott: Nope.

325
00:21:11,882 --> 00:21:14,090
Scott: Can I go in the folder and put the old wave files in there?

326
00:21:14,651 --> 00:21:15,074
Scott: Nope.

327
00:21:15,095 --> 00:21:16,807
Scott: It would say I'm cheating because I modified the files.

328
00:21:16,867 --> 00:21:19,346
Rym: if I do that I assume so and also it would just make you worse at the game.

329
00:21:19,386 --> 00:21:39,478
Rym: probably yeah, but Basically, if you take counter-strike and put it on TV The old sounds sound way bad partly because the speakers people use that the headphones people use when they're just like watching a stream tend to be way less quality than what they use when they play a game and There's a lot of other factors.

330
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:46,011
Scott: you can read this thread and see more details on it But all I want to do now is just mention that it's the year 2017.

331
00:21:46,011 --> 00:21:48,525
Scott: Yeah, and we're talking about Starcraft encounter stray.

332
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:53,766
Scott: Yeah 17 year old game and an old and even older game than that.

333
00:21:53,786 --> 00:22:02,263
Scott: Yep Fascinating whose games are like almost 20 years old, basically Yeah, you know what else we're still talking about and they're still the games of talk.

334
00:22:02,283 --> 00:22:04,090
Rym: go to any average Wednesday GeekNights.

335
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:06,218
Rym: We'll bring up Evangelion occasionally.

336
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:07,564
Scott: These are still the games of note.

337
00:22:07,624 --> 00:22:08,608
Scott: Even Jillian's even older.

338
00:22:08,628 --> 00:22:15,710
Rym: Yep So they changed another sound too and this one pissed the counter-strike community off.

339
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:17,615
Scott: What noise could they change the chain?

340
00:22:17,695 --> 00:22:23,170
Rym: the knives of the chicken guns now make a unique and subtle sound?

341
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:29,550
Scott: in the last few bullets of their clip The clips emptying so it is a hollow space in it.

342
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:31,480
Rym: So there's a low ammo noise.

343
00:22:31,801 --> 00:22:32,143
Rym: you can.

344
00:22:32,425 --> 00:22:38,724
Rym: if you were paying attention You can listen and hear when someone is running out of ammo with a particular gun.

345
00:22:38,844 --> 00:22:40,709
Scott: Is that true in real life as well?

346
00:22:41,571 --> 00:22:48,115
Scott: Sometimes if someone has an AK and they just start shooting it like crazy and the clip gets to like 80% Empty will the noise sound different?

347
00:22:48,416 --> 00:22:52,530
Rym: So by default, I don't think that is something a human could figure out.

348
00:22:53,432 --> 00:22:53,918
Scott: What do you mean.

349
00:22:53,938 --> 00:22:56,074
Scott: take an AK and just let You.

350
00:22:56,535 --> 00:23:00,690
Rym: I don't think you could perceive that difference even if it existed in the real world.

351
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:01,753
Rym: That's my guess.

352
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:07,290
Rym: but I know that in World War two and the Vietnam War a lot of clips would make a noise.

353
00:23:07,732 --> 00:23:09,861
Rym: Well, that clips magazines gun people.

354
00:23:09,902 --> 00:23:11,549
Rym: don't fucking bother me about that shit.

355
00:23:13,032 --> 00:23:15,829
Rym: They would make a pinging sound when you ran out of ammo.

356
00:23:16,191 --> 00:23:21,692
Rym: Hmm, which was good because it would remind you that you're out of ammo and it was bad because it told everyone around you You're out of ammo.

357
00:23:21,953 --> 00:23:26,808
Rym: Mmm, but basically they change this like a typewriter to get it.

358
00:23:26,828 --> 00:23:27,290
Scott: to get it to get it.

359
00:23:30,436 --> 00:23:32,410
Rym: Some of the grognards who play counter-strike.

360
00:23:32,631 --> 00:23:38,590
Rym: We're super mad about it because it removes the skill of counting how many bullets everyone's used and blabber blabber blabber.

361
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:40,509
Scott: This is why Starcraft ain't changing shit.

362
00:23:40,912 --> 00:23:42,160
Scott: It's the same deal.

363
00:23:42,361 --> 00:23:53,742
Rym: But meanwhile the wider Professional community that isn't like super grognardy about it seems to have agreed that actually it's a minor change That's probably pretty good and that people are overreacting this.

364
00:23:53,843 --> 00:24:00,730
Scott: This is the two extremes right the Starcraft Which is you know run and played by the purists and the counter-strike not afraid to change shit.

365
00:24:00,931 --> 00:24:03,210
Scott: Yeah, we're on like the third version of counter-strike.

366
00:24:03,411 --> 00:24:07,949
Scott: There's still only now the first Starcraft and the new one is compatible with the old one.

367
00:24:08,431 --> 00:24:13,770
Rym: Overwatch changes things all the time as well, but a big difference between how Blizzard does this stuff.

368
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:16,142
Scott: Well, how ever watch is not 20 years old.

369
00:24:16,162 --> 00:24:16,684
Scott: You don't have.

370
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:17,770
Scott: you don't have purists, right?

371
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:18,092
Scott: You can.

372
00:24:18,334 --> 00:24:24,983
Scott: it's a brand new thing so you can keep changing it all you want Yep, and set the standard right kind of like how hockey rules change all the time.

373
00:24:25,284 --> 00:24:28,627
Rym: baseball rules don't change that often Right, they probably should.

374
00:24:29,571 --> 00:24:30,416
Scott: They're changing more.

375
00:24:30,456 --> 00:24:39,651
Rym: But yeah, I think it's I think baseball too late for baseball but valve Basically just made the change and then you know The butter.

376
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:49,149
Rym: people got butter and the pro people like there's all this like internal nonsense community drama around this really really minor change.

377
00:24:50,290 --> 00:25:00,541
Rym: But blizzard every time they're gonna make a change they always put the changes on this public test region so you can always play on the current version or The coming version.

378
00:25:00,561 --> 00:25:01,630
Rym: that's getting feedback.

379
00:25:02,312 --> 00:25:07,790
Rym: So the community as a result feels like they have input even though Blizzard appears to mostly ignore those people because they're wrong.

380
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:08,790
Scott: Yeah, you know what?

381
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:14,110
Scott: No one does that for card games and they really should because every card game on earth when they come up with new cards.

382
00:25:15,354 --> 00:25:16,730
Scott: It's like just have a test thing.

383
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:18,496
Rym: Yeah have the test and have that.

384
00:25:18,536 --> 00:25:22,530
Scott: have the crazy, you know, the evil players who like to make the evil decks.

385
00:25:22,791 --> 00:25:26,970
Scott: You know play there and figure out the evil cards first and then never release the evil cards to everyone else.

386
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:32,929
Rym: Yep, it's like a honeypot for shitheads like a really shitty card and then let people base their beta decks around it.

387
00:25:34,211 --> 00:25:48,950
Rym: so this is all fascinating and you should read both these articles because they go to a lot more depth than I have any time to get into on the show because It's time for things of the day.

388
00:25:49,472 --> 00:25:50,156
Rym: You got for me.

389
00:25:50,538 --> 00:25:51,584
Scott: What's the name of this thing?

390
00:25:51,624 --> 00:25:52,710
Scott: It has a name in Dutch.

391
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:54,777
Scott: I'm not gonna I can't pronounce it headwinds.

392
00:25:55,018 --> 00:25:57,265
Scott: I know the actual name of it is like something Dutch.

393
00:25:57,326 --> 00:25:59,454
Rym: Hagen win fight Fiest.

394
00:25:59,574 --> 00:26:00,439
Scott: yeah, just okay.

395
00:26:00,499 --> 00:26:02,750
Rym: It might send if you might say I guess like fighting.

396
00:26:02,991 --> 00:26:05,058
Scott: Yeah, but the point is what I can win fights in.

397
00:26:05,138 --> 00:26:06,282
Scott: this is a competition.

398
00:26:06,302 --> 00:26:07,165
Rym: Hagen van fights in.

399
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:08,470
Scott: this is a Dutch competition.

400
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:18,650
Scott: Someone's gonna make fun of me for how I said that hanging in some fights in in the competition people are bicycling Into a headwind so the wind is blowing at their face and they're biking forward.

401
00:26:20,693 --> 00:26:23,620
Scott: It is a very very very very strong headwind.

402
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:31,802
Scott: they wait for a day with this particular weather in order to do it and Then everyone on a shitty ass bike.

403
00:26:32,203 --> 00:26:33,287
Scott: Oh my god.

404
00:26:33,347 --> 00:26:34,270
Scott: with one gear.

405
00:26:34,611 --> 00:26:39,007
Scott: No, they say everyone has the same shitty kind of shitty ass bike with one gear.

406
00:26:39,027 --> 00:26:42,278
Rym: this guy in the video I've got up looks like he's probably crying.

407
00:26:42,318 --> 00:26:45,770
Scott: you have to bike like X kilometers into the headwind.

408
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:48,660
Scott: It's not stopping and whoever has the best time.

409
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,268
Scott: It's just time trial is the winner.

410
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:56,883
Rym: I Feel really bad when I'm biking into like that little bit of wind.

411
00:26:56,923 --> 00:27:07,169
Scott: you get coming around the curve on the east side bike path Don't know if I open my balcony, and I see that there's a wind and I see like trees moving I Don't get on my bike, and I go take the subway.

412
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:17,070
Rym: This guy just he looks like he's crying while he's right Is like a previous winner and he was not the winner this time trying to defend his title.

413
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,796
Scott: Yeah, this video is actually kind of old.

414
00:27:18,836 --> 00:27:20,743
Scott: When's it from like 20?

415
00:27:20,743 --> 00:27:23,011
Rym: It is from December 11th 2014.

416
00:27:23,011 --> 00:27:25,730
Scott: Yeah, so this is an old, but I mean they still do this, right?

417
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:29,790
Scott: I'm sure you can maybe if you search around find a video from a newer one, but this video is good enough.

418
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:30,633
Rym: Yeah, this is pretty good.

419
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:33,924
Rym: So because I was talking about counter-strike.

420
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:37,639
Rym: Here's an article from a blog I follow that it's an interesting blog it has.

421
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,170
Rym: if you're into this kind of thing you can follow the blog.

422
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:47,207
Rym: But my thing of the day is you know the p90 the gun that's in counter-strike They get it's the best gun in goes in ghost in the shell.

423
00:27:47,247 --> 00:27:50,909
Scott: effectively It's the best gun in Goldeneye and counter-strike.

424
00:27:51,231 --> 00:27:55,208
Rym: It is the fabric national p90 and the fabric national 5-7 pistol.

425
00:27:56,072 --> 00:28:03,184
Rym: These are two weapons that people who don't know shit about guns But think they know shit about guns because they played counter-strike or other games.

426
00:28:03,425 --> 00:28:04,830
Rym: We'll talk about all the time.

427
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:11,237
Scott: Well, the p90 is just used in so many movies and things because even though it's a real gun in the real world That's also widely used like.

428
00:28:11,297 --> 00:28:13,104
Rym: it is a ultra modern gun.

429
00:28:13,305 --> 00:28:14,430
Scott: It's the submachine gun.

430
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:21,237
Scott: It shoots a lot of bullets really really well and it loads with like this Rectangular magazine on the top that put.

431
00:28:21,257 --> 00:28:22,862
Rym: the bullets are sideways right.

432
00:28:22,902 --> 00:28:25,590
Rym: they twist down a loading ramp into the gun, right?

433
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:29,759
Scott: It looks like super futuristic But it's totally just a real gun that you can buy.

434
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:32,609
Scott: and if you're like some special forces person you probably have some.

435
00:28:32,709 --> 00:28:35,010
Rym: it was Originally designed for rear echelon troops.

436
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:48,455
Rym: So basically people in the military who are behind the front lines in a war who need to be able to defend themselves But don't need to be fighting on the front lines of a war and they don't need like an assault rifle or like a regular Old rifle like an m16.

437
00:28:48,556 --> 00:28:51,770
Scott: Yeah, you don't need something that can like shoot across the battlefield.

438
00:28:51,891 --> 00:28:58,090
Scott: You need something goes like you're in town and if some crazy bad guys in town You have to do some you know urban type warfare.

439
00:28:58,893 --> 00:29:07,810
Rym: So like if you kind of like you do in counter-strike where you're in a little high-capacity Uh, you know, I think these things hold like 50 bullets a whole lot.

440
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:13,756
Rym: Yeah, and if you don't need like an m4 carbine or anything bigger like a full-on rifle or whatever It's gonna fucking kill someone.

441
00:29:13,796 --> 00:29:14,239
Scott: is the point.

442
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:14,701
Scott: it's a gun.

443
00:29:15,164 --> 00:29:16,270
Scott: It's gonna kill them just the same.

444
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:25,301
Rym: So as crazy as this gun is this article actually has a bunch of images of the prototypes When they were designing this gun because it is a crazy gun.

445
00:29:25,402 --> 00:29:28,370
Rym: and if you think it's crazy these prototypes you just way crazy.

446
00:29:28,451 --> 00:29:31,450
Rym: I mean if you just look at this one looks like it's something from Robocop.

447
00:29:31,691 --> 00:29:34,383
Scott: I mean you just look at the actual gun and you know that it's like.

448
00:29:34,544 --> 00:29:35,970
Scott: it's so crazy to begin with right?

449
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:38,890
Scott: So the prototypes is you know, everything about this gun is great.

450
00:29:39,292 --> 00:29:49,641
Rym: this article is just really interesting if you don't know anything about this thing and When some nerd who thinks they know about guns because they played counter-strike tries to talk to you about the FNP 90 You can talk even more about the FNP 90.

451
00:29:49,641 --> 00:29:51,310
Rym: You'll know one more thing than they know.

452
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:53,485
Scott: So are these prototypes like the p80 the p70 the piece?

453
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:55,996
Rym: No These are just prototypes.

454
00:29:56,117 --> 00:30:01,486
Rym: as they were designing they had a set of Not to get too much into how the fan by the way is the company that makes it.

455
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:02,250
Rym: I'll break national.

456
00:30:02,511 --> 00:30:22,143
Rym: Yeah, when a gun is being designed usually the military like a military or a police Organization will say here are our requirements We want it to have at least this much capacity Use this kind around have these kinds of performance characteristics and then gun manufacturers will design guns that meet or exceed those requirements And then they'll have trials.

457
00:30:22,547 --> 00:30:22,608
Scott: Mmm.

458
00:30:23,091 --> 00:30:35,156
Rym: So these are some of the designs that did not make it to the final rounds of that early prototyping And This one has like a pistol built into it like a pistol grip and it looks like a pistol But then the gun shoots out the bottom.

459
00:30:35,658 --> 00:30:36,139
Scott: guns are bad.

460
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:36,782
Scott: Don't kill people.

461
00:30:36,942 --> 00:30:39,310
Rym: Yeah, but guns are also really fascinating.

462
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:39,691
Rym: You know what?

463
00:30:39,711 --> 00:30:39,972
Rym: You know what?

464
00:30:39,992 --> 00:30:41,475
Rym: It's like it's like fighter jets.

465
00:30:41,876 --> 00:30:46,900
Rym: everything about fighter jets is Absolutely amazing except the fact that we use them to murder.

466
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,005
Scott: Mmm.

467
00:30:48,025 --> 00:30:49,030
Scott: We just use them to get places.

468
00:30:49,312 --> 00:30:56,427
Scott: Yeah, you know how fast I could get like I had to go to Europe how fast I could be there if I could take like a b2.

469
00:30:56,587 --> 00:30:57,210
Rym: What's that fighter?

470
00:30:57,571 --> 00:30:59,601
Scott: Yes, we saw if anything would get you.

471
00:30:59,701 --> 00:31:01,550
Rym: what's that fighter jet we saw in the in the museum?

472
00:31:01,951 --> 00:31:03,569
Rym: That was notable for that.

473
00:31:03,911 --> 00:31:08,150
Rym: It could fly faster than his own bullets and one of them shot itself down in a test, right?

474
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:10,480
Scott: But the point is, you know, you can get where you're going real fast.

475
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,649
Scott: Just you'll need to refuel like three times.

476
00:31:14,275 --> 00:31:30,458
Rym: You know when I was a kid I did a star base program at International Guard base and one of the things we learned was doing navigation for like jets and stuff and like route planning and we literally had to plan like attack runs for f-16s, which meant like Refueling and how far could you go?

477
00:31:30,518 --> 00:31:33,010
Scott: and like we're not far at all because you're going so fast.

478
00:31:33,071 --> 00:31:38,084
Scott: They go real fast but the burn rate fuel tank is not large and you're burning all the fuel in like one.

479
00:31:38,124 --> 00:31:38,846
Rym: go the fuel.

480
00:31:38,866 --> 00:31:49,750
Scott: the fuel burn rate was Like a full order of magnitude more than a normal play Really old arcade games where you're like in a jet and there's like fuel and the fuel keeps running out and you're like god damn it.

481
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:50,413
Rym: It's kind of like that.

482
00:31:50,453 --> 00:31:50,976
Rym: It's realistic.

483
00:31:51,358 --> 00:31:52,382
Rym: It's always been like that.

484
00:31:52,403 --> 00:31:53,930
Scott: It's still like that.

485
00:31:54,030 --> 00:32:04,910
Rym: Yeah, so yeah in the meta moment, the book club book is Frank Herbert's Dune Dune, which we've just never read all the way through and probably make fun of us for it and fuck you.

486
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:05,291
Rym: It's.

487
00:32:05,472 --> 00:32:15,930
Scott: that's how important nerd book of all time previous booklet book was good or bad Rebecca which you should read cuz it's short important movie not nerd book of all time.

488
00:32:16,971 --> 00:32:32,777
Rym: Otherwise, we have no conventions until we have like zinc icon and then I think ConnectiCon and then Pax Prime and then Pax unplugged and then I am almost definitely going to be at Pax Australia this year Bringing the panels back.

489
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:38,688
Rym: Scott can come if he wants but because anyway You don't have to decide until way later because you'll get the badge.

490
00:32:38,728 --> 00:32:42,529
Rym: either way I can go by myself and I'm not paying to fly so mmm.

491
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:46,386
Rym: But right now round-trip tickets to Sydney and coach are like 700 bucks.

492
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:49,678
Scott: Yeah, but we're going to Melbourne not Sydney.

493
00:32:49,738 --> 00:32:51,223
Rym: Yeah, same price basically.

494
00:32:51,343 --> 00:32:53,550
Rym: Okay, plus you can fly between Melbourne and Sydney.

495
00:32:54,032 --> 00:32:55,377
Rym: It's like a dollar.

496
00:32:55,477 --> 00:32:57,987
Rym: It's like less than an hour flight and it's like 30 bucks.

497
00:32:58,047 --> 00:32:58,549
Rym: cuz I've done it.

498
00:32:58,931 --> 00:33:01,282
Rym: Yeah, you just fly like tiger air or something.

499
00:33:01,302 --> 00:33:01,684
Rym: Mm-hmm.

500
00:33:04,093 --> 00:33:13,083
Rym: Another thing that's kind of important is We've been getting just recently like over the last month or two Multiple requests from people for various reasons.

501
00:33:13,224 --> 00:33:15,837
Scott: multiple meaning a handful with three Oh, which is still planning.

502
00:33:15,858 --> 00:33:17,730
Rym: Yeah, three people which you know is significant.

503
00:33:18,091 --> 00:33:26,468
Rym: significant considering we're not a popular thing and also just consider is a large percentage of our audience considering the percentage of people for whom This is a necessity.

504
00:33:27,511 --> 00:33:42,297
Rym: Asking for closed captions on our panel videos, which upon doing research it would cost about $20,000 for me to pay a company to sub to do real closed captions that are accurate on Just our panel videos and nothing else.

505
00:33:42,578 --> 00:33:47,238
Rym: Mm-hmm to do all our videos would be like $300,000 probably.

506
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:47,961
Rym: Mm-hmm.

507
00:33:48,062 --> 00:33:49,990
Rym: I can I cannot pay for that out of my pocket.

508
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:57,045
Scott: There's also no reason to do that because in the relatively midterm Robots and computers be able to do it for us.

509
00:33:57,106 --> 00:33:57,529
Rym: I hope so.

510
00:33:58,032 --> 00:34:07,848
Rym: so basically enough I'm gonna link to a forum thread where we're talking about this because If you didn't know you there's a whole interface built into YouTube, it's actually a really good interface.

511
00:34:07,888 --> 00:34:08,330
Scott: I tried it.

512
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:13,290
Scott: I subtitled like I closed captioned 10 seconds of our video of one of our videos.

513
00:34:13,571 --> 00:34:15,924
Scott: I closed and it was very is very easy to do.

514
00:34:15,944 --> 00:34:16,949
Rym: It's just time-consuming.

515
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:18,356
Scott: It's just very time-consuming.

516
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:27,750
Rym: Yeah, one of our listeners on quality took the time to Completely closed caption all of the designing game rules panel your hero.

517
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:33,710
Rym: It took him a whole weekend and in this forum thread He noticed some really interesting things about how me and Scott talk.

518
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:38,010
Scott: Those were not new information to me, but they may be new information to anyone else who isn't paying attention.

519
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:41,310
Rym: Yep, they are spot-on about how the two of us interact.

520
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:46,830
Rym: Another listener and I don't know who cuz they didn't claim credit did my five nights at Freddy's video.

521
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:48,601
Rym: Someone else did another video.

522
00:34:48,822 --> 00:34:50,050
Rym: There's a spreadsheet I made.

523
00:34:50,371 --> 00:34:58,350
Rym: So if anyone wants to contribute closed captions to our videos Go to this thread and make sure you're not wasting your effort if someone else has already claimed a video to work on it.

524
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:03,104
Scott: I'm also really curious how we have fans who are hearing impaired because we're doing a podcast.

525
00:35:03,525 --> 00:35:11,375
Scott: if you want to start subtitling the thousands of episodes of GeekNights Good luck.

526
00:35:11,535 --> 00:35:12,901
Scott: or transcribing.

527
00:35:13,041 --> 00:35:14,146
Rym: Yeah transcribing them.

528
00:35:14,166 --> 00:35:14,246
Rym: Yeah.

529
00:35:15,793 --> 00:35:18,990
Scott: But also I know no one listening needs the closed caption.

530
00:35:19,513 --> 00:35:21,063
Rym: I did add a patreon goal.

531
00:35:21,164 --> 00:35:31,990
Rym: if I hit that goal I'm gonna take all the patreon money that comes in and just as fast as I can pay a company to do our videos in Order of how often they are watched.

532
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:35,389
Scott: You're just gonna use all the patreon money for that all the L basically.

533
00:35:35,429 --> 00:35:42,166
Rym: if so Basically if people hit that goal I think I can do two a month with that in with that new income coming in like I won't.

534
00:35:42,226 --> 00:35:52,201
Rym: I won't take the previous money Except I took some of the previous money and I paid a company 300 bucks to do a professional Closed captioning of our old mastering game mechanics panel.

535
00:35:52,702 --> 00:35:55,270
Rym: and those subtitles are also fantastic.

536
00:35:55,551 --> 00:36:02,510
Rym: Like they did a fucking I cannot believe that they got the word Provost without asking me what the hell we were talking about.

537
00:36:02,711 --> 00:36:03,518
Scott: That's pretty good.

538
00:36:03,558 --> 00:36:04,970
Rym: They missed two words in the whole thing.

539
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:12,070
Rym: They missed the concept of king making which is a kind of really like weird inside baseball term, I guess and tantamount.

540
00:36:12,873 --> 00:36:14,146
Scott: They don't know the word tantamount.

541
00:36:14,308 --> 00:36:25,970
Rym: well I said it real fast today in a context that I Could see how someone who does not know about games might think I was talking about a game mechanic of some kind.

542
00:36:26,191 --> 00:36:32,060
Scott: Maybe because we talk real fast Was it really worth it for the person to put it cuz like.

543
00:36:32,161 --> 00:36:34,230
Scott: I saw how much effort it was to do five seconds.

544
00:36:34,853 --> 00:36:37,889
Scott: If you paid me $300, I would not have continued to the end.

545
00:36:38,591 --> 00:36:39,033
Scott: And the per.

546
00:36:39,093 --> 00:36:45,693
Scott: and if it's a company the company's taken some of that 300. so the person doing it is making less than the 300.

547
00:36:45,693 --> 00:36:53,941
Rym: the other reason I bring all this up is that for about I assume only one person did the whole thing and they didn't Have a team for a but they got the whole thing done in three business days.

548
00:36:54,222 --> 00:36:55,727
Scott: Yeah, that's a that's a one-person job.

549
00:36:55,747 --> 00:37:02,484
Rym: if I Got some quotes - I am looking at getting translated subtitles as well.

550
00:37:02,664 --> 00:37:03,968
Scott: See that would be super worth it.

551
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:06,758
Scott: So I Caption that's uptight.

552
00:37:06,879 --> 00:37:08,630
Rym: I would start with Spanish.

553
00:37:09,035 --> 00:37:12,157
Rym: Yeah, that's a good idea And I think I I'm not sure what I would do next.

554
00:37:12,318 --> 00:37:12,539
Rym: if why?

555
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:15,870
Rym: you know if this all panned out, but probably German.

556
00:37:16,011 --> 00:37:19,930
Rym: But so many German speakers also speak English, but I feel like I could probably do better.

557
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:20,974
Rym: But it's like.

558
00:37:20,994 --> 00:37:23,524
Scott: shouldn't we do Chinese and other Chinese?

559
00:37:23,545 --> 00:37:24,729
Rym: I guess we could.

560
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:33,270
Rym: You know, yeah the most spoken languages there are or Japanese partly because actually there is a burgeoning like Andy tabletop scene over there.

561
00:37:33,912 --> 00:37:39,028
Rym: I feel like there is a dearth of game design lectures about tabletop in Japanese.

562
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:40,374
Scott: Arabic Also good choice.

563
00:37:40,575 --> 00:37:41,801
Rym: Arabic could actually be a really good choice.

564
00:37:41,962 --> 00:37:43,993
Rym: good choice, but Spanish first We'll see.

565
00:37:44,093 --> 00:37:45,684
Rym: I'm still getting quotes and looking at all this.

566
00:37:46,066 --> 00:37:47,232
Rym: stay tuned This.

567
00:37:47,694 --> 00:38:00,489
Rym: this might be a good direction to put patreon money for this foreseeable future Because I feel like that's just a nice public good like it's the exact kind of thing That I couldn't afford to do on my own but I would do if I could have money to just do it.

568
00:38:01,151 --> 00:38:06,100
Scott: I feel like even so like that's that's a better use of patreon money than other things.

569
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:12,237
Scott: but Shouldn't we be spending it to subtitle things that people should actually be watching.

570
00:38:12,278 --> 00:38:12,979
Scott: Well, not us.

571
00:38:13,319 --> 00:38:21,330
Rym: Yeah, if you're Why are we doing gig nights when we could literally be in Somalia right now helping people?

572
00:38:22,073 --> 00:38:23,399
Scott: We couldn't we would just die in Somalia.

573
00:38:23,419 --> 00:38:23,861
Scott: It's a horrible.

574
00:38:23,881 --> 00:38:24,584
Rym: Why don't we try?

575
00:38:24,624 --> 00:38:25,448
Rym: Why are you even?

576
00:38:25,689 --> 00:38:25,970
Rym: why are we?

577
00:38:26,131 --> 00:38:31,450
Rym: Donating all our income you go first hundred percent of our income you go first so worthy causes not going there.

578
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:34,627
Scott: Oh, yeah, you know I could be doing a lot of work doing research on the surface of the Sun.

579
00:38:34,647 --> 00:38:35,110
Scott: Why don't I go?

580
00:38:35,851 --> 00:38:39,065
Rym: Yeah, so anyway, we're at packs PAX East.

581
00:38:39,185 --> 00:38:39,908
Rym: they all blur together.

582
00:38:39,928 --> 00:38:48,149
Rym: at this point There's just so many packs and we weren't enforcing and paneling we were playing games and our good friends Chris and Anthony They uh, they bring the games.

583
00:38:48,531 --> 00:38:54,770
Rym: They said something to me and it was a combination of words that did not at first make sense.

584
00:38:55,051 --> 00:38:59,370
Rym: They said hey, I got a Friedman Freese trivia game if you want to play it.

585
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:03,329
Scott: So that's apparently not entirely true, but it sort of is true, right?

586
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:04,312
Scott: So here's the thing.

587
00:39:04,332 --> 00:39:07,843
Scott: Rym does not like trivia games in general and I understand why.

588
00:39:07,863 --> 00:39:08,605
Scott: here's the real.

589
00:39:08,645 --> 00:39:09,348
Rym: so it's complicated.

590
00:39:09,368 --> 00:39:13,924
Rym: I Really like trivia games and also really hate trivia games.

591
00:39:14,125 --> 00:39:15,450
Rym: I was a varsity quiz ball, right?

592
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:17,416
Scott: Here's the problem with trivia games, right?

593
00:39:17,456 --> 00:39:18,078
Scott: Is there games of?

594
00:39:18,278 --> 00:39:19,402
Scott: they're not games of skill.

595
00:39:19,944 --> 00:39:23,370
Scott: They're not games of decision-making They're not even games of luck.

596
00:39:23,912 --> 00:39:29,990
Scott: It's just you either of a lot of them most of them especially trivial pursuit the worst of all are just binary.

597
00:39:30,271 --> 00:39:36,256
Scott: you I get asked a question and you either know the answer and Succeed or you don't write.

598
00:39:36,316 --> 00:39:37,920
Scott: someone either asks you like, uh-huh.

599
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,585
Scott: What's the first boss of Zelda 1?

600
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:41,190
Scott: and you know like Aquinas, right?

601
00:39:42,111 --> 00:39:48,467
Scott: Somebody asks you, you know, what year did Louis Armstrong releases first album?

602
00:39:48,507 --> 00:39:49,390
Scott: And what was it named?

603
00:39:49,691 --> 00:39:51,095
Rym: Yeah, it's like the Rangers games.

604
00:39:51,115 --> 00:39:51,818
Rym: They'll have the trivia.

605
00:39:51,838 --> 00:39:55,390
Rym: That's like how many goals did so-and-so score in this important game?

606
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:56,193
Rym: And it's multiple choice.

607
00:39:56,213 --> 00:40:01,290
Rym: You're like, yeah, I got this and then it's like a 3 b 4 c 5 d 6.

608
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:03,657
Scott: Yeah, and it's like you either know it or you don't.

609
00:40:03,698 --> 00:40:10,210
Scott: it's binary and it's not fun or exciting or you know And you barely you don't even really learn anything value.

610
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:10,792
Rym: Well, I guess it's.

611
00:40:10,893 --> 00:40:11,033
Rym: it's.

612
00:40:11,214 --> 00:40:19,450
Rym: it's fun and exciting if the domain of the trivia overlaps heavily with the domain of knowledge of all the players.

613
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:20,172
Rym: Correct.

614
00:40:20,413 --> 00:40:22,802
Rym: That is the only situation where those games are fun.

615
00:40:23,042 --> 00:40:25,170
Scott: Yeah, but even if we go to nerd trivia, right?

616
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:30,595
Scott: so I've been to nerd trivia is very few times because I don't like them but Also, I don't drink.

617
00:40:30,615 --> 00:40:31,882
Scott: So I was at a non drinky one.

618
00:40:31,902 --> 00:40:33,632
Scott: Yeah, it was a nerd NYC thing Remember, I

619
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:37,610
Rym: remember that and one of the questions was like fist of the North Star something exactly

620
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:43,363
Scott: That was in my domain and I was like, yeah I know what else knew what the hell you know fist of the North Star was.

621
00:40:43,403 --> 00:40:45,050
Rym: you were the only table that got that one.

622
00:40:45,452 --> 00:40:49,168
Scott: But then they were asking questions about like Star Trek or whatever other garbage.

623
00:40:49,208 --> 00:40:52,423
Scott: and I'm like I don't think I remember what games of Thrones and I'm like, I don't.

624
00:40:52,483 --> 00:41:00,233
Rym: one of the questions specifically was Name all of the ajas in the Wheel of Time and that was before we'd read that fucking Book.

625
00:41:00,414 --> 00:41:03,687
Rym: and in fact, unless you've read a lot of the books you wouldn't know the answer, right?

626
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:04,490
Scott: I'm like, I'm just like.

627
00:41:05,833 --> 00:41:06,922
Scott: It's not a fun game, right?

628
00:41:06,942 --> 00:41:13,709
Scott: So This trivia game unlike garbage like Trivial Pursuit right fixes those problems.

629
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:24,308
Scott: now It's not the only trivia game to fix those problems, right jackbox fixes many of those problems by a using multiple choice and be bringing in humor even when you have no clue.

630
00:41:24,348 --> 00:41:25,692
Scott: the humor can make It valuable.

631
00:41:25,932 --> 00:41:31,730
Scott: There's also games like wits and wagers where you're sort of guessing like over-under kind of things on numbers.

632
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:36,415
Scott: Yeah, so and then you know that way it's not just pure Do you know it or do you not?

633
00:41:36,476 --> 00:41:37,640
Scott: and it's fun for everybody.

634
00:41:37,801 --> 00:41:40,030
Rym: some games really focus the domain.

635
00:41:40,291 --> 00:41:47,030
Rym: So if you are in that domain like Starcraft trivia and you play with all your Starcraft obsessed friends are like Simpsons trivia

636
00:41:47,191 --> 00:41:58,630
Scott: exactly, so here's a game called fauna and fauna is a game by Friedman Freese who Makes all his games begin with F and usually have two words like fresh fish and power grade.

637
00:41:58,630 --> 00:41:59,395
Rym: We'll go shop.

638
00:41:59,576 --> 00:42:00,421
Rym: Yeah power.

639
00:42:00,461 --> 00:42:01,890
Scott: It is actually called something else.

640
00:42:04,395 --> 00:42:06,830
Scott: Show his games come in green boxes, right?

641
00:42:07,011 --> 00:42:12,070
Scott: Anyway, the game called fauna is an animal trivia game and we didn't play fauna.

642
00:42:12,491 --> 00:42:17,807
Scott: Well, we played as a game called America a party game something something counts.

643
00:42:18,088 --> 00:42:24,958
Scott: So everyone Everyone's sitting at the table knows about America because we're all We did not.

644
00:42:25,259 --> 00:42:31,900
Scott: we're mostly American right and even the people who are not American, you know They were living in America for a significant period of time.

645
00:42:32,362 --> 00:42:34,329
Scott: and new American things, right?

646
00:42:34,369 --> 00:42:45,330
Scott: So This game is the exact or close to or exactly the same mechanics as fauna But as American trivia with a map of the United States and is made by someone else.

647
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:51,610
Rym: So the conceit is pretty simple that the the the execution is basically flawless.

648
00:42:51,923 --> 00:43:02,376
Scott: Yeah so the conceit is the only problem it has that other trivia games also have is that you will eventually go through all of the trivia cards and then The game is done for you.

649
00:43:02,577 --> 00:43:16,322
Rym: it is physically designed so that one the person who Chooses, you know, which of the two categories to use which is a great mechanic to have in any trivia game Because it allows you to direct the domain which adds a little bit of strategy.

650
00:43:16,402 --> 00:43:26,774
Rym: unlike trivial pursuit where you roll dice to determine The domain the person who asks the question is not prevented from also trying to answer because of the physical design of how those cards Work, that's true.

651
00:43:26,795 --> 00:43:27,801
Rym: They can't see the answer.

652
00:43:28,042 --> 00:43:29,410
Rym: That's a baby's first mistake.

653
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:37,332
Rym: If you make a trivia game, yep, and to the the physical thing you put them in has two sides and every trivia card has Two sides.

654
00:43:37,613 --> 00:43:48,456
Rym: So if you when you finish a card you put it facing the same direction in the other side It guarantees you will cycle through every single question Exactly once and then hit the end.

655
00:43:48,798 --> 00:43:56,430
Rym: so you will never get the situation that a lot of trivia games will get into Where you play it again and a question you saw three games ago pops up again.

656
00:43:56,791 --> 00:43:58,962
Rym: But there are questions you have not seen right?

657
00:43:59,243 --> 00:44:00,710
Scott: you keep the cards in the bog.

658
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:03,489
Scott: You can do it in trivial pursuit also if you keep the cards nicely in the.

659
00:44:03,509 --> 00:44:04,839
Rym: yeah But this game has a like.

660
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:06,210
Rym: that is part of the rules.

661
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:06,973
Rym: I keep that shit.

662
00:44:07,013 --> 00:44:09,784
Scott: you own a copy and you're the only one who ever plays it.

663
00:44:10,165 --> 00:44:14,139
Scott: you will eventually See a card you saw the first time you played.

664
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:20,630
Scott: you could even like put a slip of paper there to remember where that spot Is yep, and then you'll be like, oh we've played this whole game and then you can sell it to someone else.

665
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:21,335
Rym: I'm pretty confident.

666
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:25,209
Rym: by the time I got to the beginning again because there's a lot of questions I'd have forgotten the answers to a lot of them.

667
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:26,840
Scott: That's also true cuz.

668
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,369
Scott: there's a lot of questions in this box.

669
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:42,070
Rym: But the conceit is that once the question is asked and you pick from one of two topics The question will be about a thing like Pez or something something American the Olympics a sport and they'll actually be three questions.

670
00:44:42,593 --> 00:44:45,432
Rym: The answer to one of them will be a year Mm-hmm.

671
00:44:45,472 --> 00:44:49,566
Rym: the answer to one of them will be a number and the answer to one of them will be a state.

672
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:57,302
Scott: Mm-hmm In the United States like Connecticut Oklahoma five Guessing cubes.

673
00:44:57,383 --> 00:45:04,234
Rym: It's a cube game Yep And on your turn you choose one of those questions and you put your cube on What you think.

674
00:45:04,274 --> 00:45:07,530
Scott: the answer to that question is now you don't have to even be exactly right.

675
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:14,856
Scott: For example, if you think that you know the Mets won the World Series in 1986, which they did There isn't a spot.

676
00:45:14,896 --> 00:45:15,539
Rym: just that's the thing.

677
00:45:15,579 --> 00:45:16,162
Rym: I would not know.

678
00:45:16,222 --> 00:45:18,633
Scott: there isn't a spot just for 1986.

679
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:22,191
Scott: There's a spot that's like 1985 through 1990.

680
00:45:22,191 --> 00:45:23,638
Rym: they're all ranges.

681
00:45:23,678 --> 00:45:24,462
Scott: They're all ranges.

682
00:45:24,523 --> 00:45:30,743
Scott: So you just put your cube there 1985 through 1990. right now the next person has to put their cube out.

683
00:45:30,763 --> 00:45:32,830
Scott: you take turns so they're like damn it.

684
00:45:32,951 --> 00:45:33,878
Scott: I knew it was 1986, but I can't go there.

685
00:45:35,751 --> 00:45:39,970
Scott: They can just put their cube next to yours and still get points because they're one away.

686
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:42,739
Rym: So even they could go answer a different question, right?

687
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:52,230
Scott: They might be like, well, they got a lot of points for picking 1986 But I know that, you know, the state the Mets play in is New York and they'll put their cube on New York.

688
00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:53,035
Scott: It's like aha.

689
00:45:53,055 --> 00:45:55,230
Scott: I got points for that and now people go.

690
00:45:55,472 --> 00:45:58,070
Scott: I know it's New York also, but they can't put their cube on New York.

691
00:45:58,431 --> 00:46:01,340
Scott: So they put their cube on adjacent states like New Jersey.

692
00:46:01,521 --> 00:46:05,797
Rym: So you get I think three points if you are correct Yep, and you get nothing.

693
00:46:05,837 --> 00:46:07,727
Scott: It's seven points if you get a bunch of points.

694
00:46:07,767 --> 00:46:13,418
Rym: if you're correct Yeah, and you get a smaller number of points if you are Next to the correct answer.

695
00:46:13,438 --> 00:46:17,930
Scott: if you're more than one space away from the correct answer Then you get no points and you lose your cube.

696
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:18,934
Rym: yep, and you only get.

697
00:46:18,995 --> 00:46:28,270
Rym: and if you lose too many cubes you either recent you bump back out to I think three like you Reset or if you're at three or more you get one cube from your lost pile back every round.

698
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:36,250
Scott: now Here's another benefit of this game Usually in a game of trivia when no one knows the answer because something ridiculous like what year did something's crazy happen?

699
00:46:36,411 --> 00:46:37,918
Scott: Like what year was Pez invented?

700
00:46:37,958 --> 00:46:39,425
Scott: it was like I don't fucking know right?

701
00:46:39,807 --> 00:46:42,658
Rym: one person's like 1976. is someone else like 1908?

702
00:46:42,658 --> 00:46:44,444
Scott: it could have been 18 something.

703
00:46:44,464 --> 00:46:45,869
Scott: You don't even know they had sugar then right?

704
00:46:45,889 --> 00:46:47,992
Scott: It's like Right.

705
00:46:48,273 --> 00:46:51,926
Scott: So everyone starts guessing but you can vote and you can say you know what.

706
00:46:52,347 --> 00:46:56,450
Scott: I think Nobody got the answer exactly, right?

707
00:46:56,690 --> 00:47:00,330
Rym: And you can also say I don't think anyone's even gonna be near the answer.

708
00:47:00,711 --> 00:47:06,069
Scott: And if you say that and it turns out to be true you get points if everyone else is actually wrong.

709
00:47:06,752 --> 00:47:14,250
Scott: so you can just bet on people being wrong when no one knows the answer which gives a Strategy and fun element to questions that are bullshit.

710
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:17,182
Scott: So they're not just complete wastes like they are in trivial pursuit.

711
00:47:17,283 --> 00:47:18,970
Rym: the scope of the questions is great.

712
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:27,750
Rym: So like the number part see it's a scale and it starts like you can bet like zero one, two, three But then the scale gets bigger and bigger.

713
00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:34,992
Rym: So when the top half the gradations are a hundred thousand a million ten million a hundred million a billion Right.

714
00:47:35,012 --> 00:47:41,176
Scott: So if you think it's between a hundred million and a billion you just vote on the hundred million spot and you're good to Go, you'll be exactly right.

715
00:47:41,217 --> 00:47:45,862
Rym: if you're right the years go to like to the year The game was made and they started 1492, right?

716
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:53,630
Scott: Yeah, the the billion spot the spots at the very end actually count for like up to infinity or to negative infinity.

717
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:59,226
Scott: So like if you think it was sometime before 14, whatever you just vote on 14 Whatever and that goes all the way back to.

718
00:47:59,629 --> 00:48:00,896
Scott: you know The creation of the universe.

719
00:48:01,077 --> 00:48:04,614
Rym: now in terms of play the way this ends up shaken down Is that one?

720
00:48:04,654 --> 00:48:10,700
Rym: a lot of people will act like they know the answer and then on the turn they'll be like, ah I don't actually know.

721
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:16,761
Rym: Yeah, and two You get context from other players Which is where a lot of the magic happens.

722
00:48:16,781 --> 00:48:22,590
Rym: because even if you don't really know Like so one of the questions that we were all we were all super fucking dumb about this.

723
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:25,603
Rym: We were super stupid, but it was where did you?

724
00:48:25,644 --> 00:48:27,070
Rym: where did jaws take place?

725
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:28,999
Rym: Like where was that book slash movie set?

726
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:30,667
Scott: We were so sure it was like Jersey.

727
00:48:30,687 --> 00:48:35,910
Scott: Yeah I'm like It was not a southern tropical beach, right?

728
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:38,557
Scott: Because you've seen the movie but it was.

729
00:48:38,597 --> 00:48:42,410
Scott: it was still a beach in the summer right clearly Atlantic waters.

730
00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:43,915
Scott: It wasn't beautiful Pacific water.

731
00:48:43,956 --> 00:48:45,983
Scott: Yeah, so we're all like God Jersey.

732
00:48:46,023 --> 00:48:46,304
Scott: That's it.

733
00:48:46,344 --> 00:48:47,027
Scott: It's warm enough.

734
00:48:47,047 --> 00:48:47,850
Scott: You're going to the beach.

735
00:48:48,233 --> 00:48:50,069
Scott: It felt like Jersey, you know.

736
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:54,788
Rym: So half of us kind of knew or at least thought we knew and we're very confident like put our guys right down there.

737
00:48:54,808 --> 00:49:00,550
Rym: other People saw like oh both of them are guessing like the Jersey area and they seem really confident.

738
00:49:00,651 --> 00:49:03,610
Scott: So I'm gonna go to like Pennsylvania, which is right or Delaware, right?

739
00:49:06,833 --> 00:49:08,343
Scott: Right next to be adjacent, right?

740
00:49:08,383 --> 00:49:09,390
Scott: It's a next to Jersey.

741
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:12,489
Scott: They were just trying to get points but putting their cubes next to the right answer.

742
00:49:12,731 --> 00:49:17,250
Rym: But in another one like what it was I think the question was literally what stays the Pez Museum in world?

743
00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:18,251
Rym: Right.

744
00:49:18,532 --> 00:49:22,968
Rym: So someone hazards a guess and then other people are like, yeah, that feels right.

745
00:49:23,009 --> 00:49:32,380
Scott: and guess near Well, I there is actually in Connecticut where I lived a Pez visitor center and a Pez factory, I think and You can see it's like billboards for it.

746
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:37,620
Scott: And there was an incident in high school where a kid brought went there and he brought a shit ton of Pez to high school.

747
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:39,768
Scott: I'm just handing out sacks of Pez to everybody.

748
00:49:39,788 --> 00:49:40,350
Scott: It was crazy.

749
00:49:40,370 --> 00:49:41,414
Scott: So I vote.

750
00:49:41,474 --> 00:49:42,940
Scott: I voted Connecticut with confidence.

751
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:46,380
Scott: I was like, yeah Pez Museum in Connecticut and apparently that's crazy wrong.

752
00:49:46,741 --> 00:49:51,557
Scott: There's only a Pez visitor center and factory in Connecticut and the Pez Museum is somewhere else.

753
00:49:51,919 --> 00:50:07,956
Rym: So basically what this means is that Even if there is a huge disparity in knowledge because some of the questions like around the Supreme Court of the Olympics it ranged from Someone who like literally knows everything about the Olympics to someone who literally has no idea about any

754
00:50:08,177 --> 00:50:09,340
Scott: doesn't know what the Olympics is

755
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:14,279
Rym: Yep, and they can both play this trivia game together and have a good time,

756
00:50:14,339 --> 00:50:14,460
Scott: right?

757
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:14,761
Scott: Cuz you.

758
00:50:14,801 --> 00:50:19,800
Scott: if you don't know the trivia you can use you can play a game of cube placing strategy instead.

759
00:50:20,222 --> 00:50:26,208
Scott: You know figuring out who do you think is right and just putting your cube next to theirs because you can't put out you Can't put out all three cubes at once.

760
00:50:26,229 --> 00:50:28,200
Scott: You got to put one cube at a time and take turns.

761
00:50:28,301 --> 00:50:28,900
Rym: Yep, you go around.

762
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:37,040
Rym: So if you know a lot about the Supreme Court and you know the answer to two of them Then you're thinking now is which one of these questions will no one else know?

763
00:50:37,241 --> 00:50:40,760
Rym: So I'll get a second go to put my answer on the second correct one.

764
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:46,040
Scott: The other thing is that any cubes you put out that don't score any points you lose those cubes.

765
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:53,860
Scott: You've only got five cubes because one of your cubes is a scoring cube on the scoring track And then you only get one cube back from the graveyard per turn.

766
00:50:53,980 --> 00:51:00,680
Scott: So you do want to take at least one risk per turn because you're gonna get that cube back.

767
00:51:01,102 --> 00:51:04,760
Scott: But if you take two risks per turn you're sort of limiting your ability.

768
00:51:04,841 --> 00:51:11,120
Scott: So like there were times you're like I could guess and get a point But I used up all my cubes because you're always gonna have at least three cubes no matter what.

769
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:14,632
Rym: Yep, I've noticed people who went bankrupt early and were basically stuck on three cubes.

770
00:51:14,653 --> 00:51:16,660
Rym: for us the game almost never.

771
00:51:17,363 --> 00:51:18,608
Rym: I don't think they ever won this game.

772
00:51:18,870 --> 00:51:19,091
Scott: Yeah.

773
00:51:19,131 --> 00:51:21,120
Scott: Well, it means they also put out a bunch of wrong cubes.

774
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:34,888
Scott: Yeah, but usually they put out a bunch of wrong cubes like way early and so it's like it's simultaneously this trivia game But it's also a like a real board game of like place cubes for optimal point scoring Right, and you're sort of balancing these two things.

775
00:51:35,269 --> 00:51:37,818
Scott: So you got interesting stuff going on two different ways.

776
00:51:37,959 --> 00:51:44,577
Scott: Yep So this game saw a lot of table actually played it like two or three times at a pack.

777
00:51:44,617 --> 00:51:45,760
Scott: So it was worth packs time.

778
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:46,945
Rym: Yep, I played it.

779
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:48,854
Rym: I want to say three times.

780
00:51:48,895 --> 00:51:53,040
Rym: I think three times it packs And I would have played it again, but we ran out of packs.

781
00:51:53,441 --> 00:51:57,920
Scott: It's also great because it's super accessible to people who aren't super hard gaming types.

782
00:51:58,121 --> 00:52:04,240
Rym: Yeah, they might miss out on that cube point placing strategy, but everyone else is gonna get into it like real hard, right?

783
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:13,131
Scott: But then but the trivia part is like anyone can get into and since if you're like us living in the u.s You're gonna know stuff right.

784
00:52:13,332 --> 00:52:17,769
Scott: the other original version which is animal trivia It might be harder for a lot of people.

785
00:52:17,829 --> 00:52:20,540
Rym: some of our friends would know a lot about that and some of our friends would.

786
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:26,339
Scott: Right, but everyone is gonna you know, because we're Americans there's gonna be cards, you know and cards you don't.

787
00:52:26,379 --> 00:52:38,608
Scott: but no You're gonna have some connection to the game if you live in or are from this place, but this mechanic Is I mean the only you could make other you should.

788
00:52:38,728 --> 00:52:42,960
Scott: someone should make many many trivia games using the same mechanic.

789
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:43,925
Rym: Dude, if I could I would just.

790
00:52:43,986 --> 00:52:46,560
Rym: I would just license it and make a series of game.

791
00:52:46,641 --> 00:52:49,904
Rym: The problem is it first state per city I'd make.

792
00:52:50,005 --> 00:52:53,180
Scott: one problem is like if we did like video game trivia, right?

793
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,167
Rym: We're gonna put for the man.

794
00:52:54,268 --> 00:52:56,605
Scott: if we did nerd trivia Like what's the map gonna be?

795
00:52:56,625 --> 00:53:00,000
Scott: we could do a number and a year for nerd trivia, but what's our math gonna be?

796
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:05,220
Rym: Yeah, you might and if you just have three number things or like that It would be it would lose a lot of its magic, right?

797
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:06,759
Scott: You need to have some sort of map.

798
00:53:06,981 --> 00:53:13,848
Scott: Money would be taking a game like you could do Lord of the Rings trivia and have a man Map of Middle Earth, but it's enough.

799
00:53:13,908 --> 00:53:15,294
Scott: how much how much?

800
00:53:15,454 --> 00:53:16,378
Scott: Lord of the Rings trivia.

801
00:53:16,418 --> 00:53:16,920
Scott: Can you make?

802
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:18,466
Scott: Can you make enough to fill a box?

803
00:53:18,546 --> 00:53:21,560
Rym: I don't know confidently if you include the silver fucking rillion, right?

804
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:23,818
Scott: And there's not enough locations in Middle Earth.

805
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:29,080
Scott: So you'd have to be really fine-grained with the locations and only so many of them are plot points.

806
00:53:29,441 --> 00:53:37,439
Scott: Yeah, it's like you would need like, you know a really complex universe To get as complex as the real universe.

807
00:53:38,203 --> 00:53:40,073
Rym: Market this to local color types.

808
00:53:40,434 --> 00:53:41,540
Rym: So there'd be a New York City one.

809
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,047
Rym: It's a map of New York City.

810
00:53:43,167 --> 00:53:45,860
Scott: you could do in New York City one broken up into neighborhoods.

811
00:53:46,041 --> 00:53:46,705
Scott: Yeah, absolutely.

812
00:53:46,725 --> 00:53:47,650
Scott: You could make a New York City.

813
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:49,400
Rym: every state every city.

814
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:51,969
Rym: That's got some history basically every single city in like.

815
00:53:52,029 --> 00:53:52,431
Rym: the thing

816
00:53:52,692 --> 00:54:03,461
Scott: is it might get boring because if you do like New York State like you're only gonna have so many topics and that are interesting and if you start doing ones that cover the boring areas It's like alright a bunch of worthless cars But

817
00:54:03,582 --> 00:54:11,640
Rym: as we found actually the boring ones for America Ended up being real interesting because even if like it was like Pez like other than you no one had any.

818
00:54:12,887 --> 00:54:13,859
Scott: We didn't do a lot of this.

819
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:21,640
Scott: But if you actually you're supposed to read the cards in completely out loud at when you're answering After you're revealing the answer they just teach you stuff and then you'll learn things.

820
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:22,345
Scott: Yeah, we did.

821
00:54:22,385 --> 00:54:24,280
Scott: We just read the answer like oh is this day?

822
00:54:24,421 --> 00:54:27,400
Scott: We didn't read the text underneath because we were running low on packs time.

823
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:33,060
Scott: Yeah But if you do read the text underneath you will get fascinating and interesting information and educate yourself.

824
00:54:33,562 --> 00:54:37,455
Rym: So yeah, if you avoid trivia games, you know trivial pursuit doesn't explain its answers.

825
00:54:37,475 --> 00:54:38,760
Scott: It says here's the answer.

826
00:54:39,222 --> 00:54:43,440
Rym: Also, we did not really encounter questions that were just broken or wrong.

827
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:44,002
Rym: We don't.

828
00:54:44,042 --> 00:54:48,056
Scott: common problem is on the questions about the states.

829
00:54:48,177 --> 00:54:49,120
Rym: It does split it up.

830
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:53,500
Scott: It tells you in advance whether it's the east half of the US or the west half.

831
00:54:53,701 --> 00:54:55,913
Scott: We're using the Mississippi River as the dividing line.

832
00:54:55,953 --> 00:54:57,180
Rym: I think at least three times.

833
00:54:57,481 --> 00:55:05,300
Scott: I think a I rally would have rather had those hints not be there Yep, and be at least one card only one card.

834
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:07,347
Scott: We saw it was actually wrong it.

835
00:55:07,488 --> 00:55:10,338
Scott: the hint was West and the answer was Easter rice verse.

836
00:55:10,379 --> 00:55:19,620
Rym: I forget But at the same time I feel like that might be oh So that might be good for people who don't know a lot about American geography.

837
00:55:19,881 --> 00:55:21,928
Rym: But there are two sides to the board.

838
00:55:21,949 --> 00:55:28,047
Rym: the front side names all the states with their Two letter acronym or initialisms.

839
00:55:28,688 --> 00:55:29,871
Rym: the bag does not have that.

840
00:55:29,971 --> 00:55:31,816
Scott: only play with the bank side only.

841
00:55:31,876 --> 00:55:33,420
Scott: side only blank side only.

842
00:55:34,242 --> 00:55:37,472
Rym: But this game only no babies super fun.

843
00:55:37,632 --> 00:55:45,220
Scott: Like we really enjoyed playing this at Pat This is a game that I would like to actually get and bring to like Thanksgiving with family.

844
00:55:45,341 --> 00:55:46,808
Rym: Yeah, just like.

845
00:55:46,908 --> 00:55:49,260
Scott: bring this because it's like because it's a real game.

846
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:53,640
Scott: They're like I would enjoy playing but also a game that everyone else would enjoy playing who's not gamers?

847
00:55:59,223 --> 00:56:01,740
