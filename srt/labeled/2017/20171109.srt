1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,751
Rym: It's Thursday, November 9th, 2017.

2
00:00:11,751 --> 00:00:12,293
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,373 --> 00:00:12,855
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,015 --> 00:00:14,660
Rym: And this is GeekNights tonight.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:15,997
Rym: Snacks.

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,378
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,819
Rym: So, uh, Scott paid me to go to the Rangers game with him last night.

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,660
Scott: I accidentally pushed the wrong button on the incredibly simple Google Wallet.

9
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,952
Rym: Yeah, I'm sitting at work and I get basically just I get this Google notification.

10
00:00:30,972 --> 00:00:32,057
Rym: It's like Scott sent you 130 bucks.

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,138
Rym: I'm like, huh, I'll bet Scott's hit send instead of take.

12
00:00:37,178 --> 00:00:37,720
Scott: That's right.

13
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,658
Rym: And I bet he's gonna message me and then immediately there's a message like oops.

14
00:00:41,881 --> 00:00:45,806
Scott: There's a message take twice as much as twice as much as was just given.

15
00:00:46,568 --> 00:00:51,839
Rym: But not to get too much into it because I know you nerds don't care but you should because sports are pretty great.

16
00:00:53,342 --> 00:00:56,773
Rym: The Rangers, the hockey team of whom we are fans.

17
00:00:57,134 --> 00:00:59,000
Scott: They started off the season El Garbajo.

18
00:00:59,301 --> 00:01:02,471
Rym: They're one of the original six and they have been a reliably good team.

19
00:01:02,531 --> 00:01:05,480
Rym: Not always a great team, but a contender for a while now.

20
00:01:06,962 --> 00:01:07,644
Scott: Last year they were good.

21
00:01:07,825 --> 00:01:08,166
Scott: Okay.

22
00:01:08,447 --> 00:01:09,431
Rym: They made it to the playoffs.

23
00:01:09,471 --> 00:01:11,660
Rym: It's already better than most people can hope for.

24
00:01:12,861 --> 00:01:14,449
Scott: NHL playoffs let a lot of teams in.

25
00:01:14,469 --> 00:01:16,620
Scott: They should probably eliminate the first round.

26
00:01:17,101 --> 00:01:18,265
Rym: But they played well, like they were.

27
00:01:18,285 --> 00:01:20,011
Rym: they were a respectably good team.

28
00:01:20,052 --> 00:01:21,216
Rym: They were not embarrassing.

29
00:01:21,356 --> 00:01:29,667
Rym: Yeah, and this season began and they went from being a respectably good team to being like the third worst team in the entire NHL.

30
00:01:30,151 --> 00:01:37,780
Rym: I think Buffalo, like the Sabres and the Coyotes were the only teams doing worse than them because at that point the Coyotes hadn't won a single game.

31
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,386
Rym: And that seems to have turned around.

32
00:01:42,887 --> 00:01:44,451
Rym: They've won five games in a row now.

33
00:01:44,472 --> 00:01:47,400
Rym: The game we saw last night was actually pretty fucking great.

34
00:01:47,861 --> 00:01:52,919
Scott: I was at the first game of this five game win streak and the fifth game of this game win streak.

35
00:01:53,821 --> 00:01:55,067
Rym: It was a good feeling.

36
00:01:55,087 --> 00:01:58,040
Scott: Started on Halloween and it's continued until yesterday.

37
00:01:58,422 --> 00:02:01,780
Rym: The only the only the bad part was they still gave up some shitty goals.

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,624
Rym: So we scored a goal and we start celebrating and then before they even finish announcing that goal Boston just scored.

39
00:02:09,644 --> 00:02:10,467
Scott: That is a weird thing.

40
00:02:10,487 --> 00:02:11,994
Scott: is that I've always wondered like they don't.

41
00:02:12,214 --> 00:02:15,232
Scott: whenever the the pug drops they cut off all music immediately.

42
00:02:15,292 --> 00:02:16,320
Rym: But they don't cut off announcements.

43
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:23,367
Scott: But it's like they'll score a goal then there'll be a face-off for that to start play again and then they'll start while they're playing.

44
00:02:23,387 --> 00:02:28,809
Scott: they'll start announcing the goal that was just scored like goal scored by such-and-such.

45
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,500
Scott: and it's like they're playing and like you're half paying attention.

46
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,260
Scott: Apparently the players are half paying attention too because that's when people score right away again.

47
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,660
Scott: It's like you should do the announcement while you know, and then drop the puck again.

48
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,983
Rym: Yeah, but I like how I'm looking at that.

49
00:02:41,003 --> 00:02:49,058
Rym: I just I typed Rangers and I see the game here and it says quote Jimmy Vesey turned nightmare season around in 29 stunning seconds.

50
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,254
Rym: Vesey's like the rising star, but none of you nerds care even though you should.

51
00:02:54,294 --> 00:02:55,499
Rym: but that's what we're up to last night.

52
00:02:56,262 --> 00:03:01,540
Scott: Also, the game started at 8 instead of 7 because it was on NBC because it's a Northeast original 6 matchup.

53
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,030
Scott: so then that you know gets NBC's, you know dick real hard.

54
00:03:05,331 --> 00:03:08,480
Rym: Games starting at 8 actually really sucks.

55
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,165
Rym: It's amazing how much that hour means when the game starts at 7. it's like I leave work at the normal time I get some food and I go to the game.

56
00:03:14,165 --> 00:03:19,280
Rym: 8 is like I've got too much time to kill to just like stay at work.

57
00:03:19,921 --> 00:03:24,344
Scott: I basically spent an hour at like the mermaid house of Wi-Fi just killing time.

58
00:03:24,364 --> 00:03:35,780
Scott: I don't know how people do work in those places because it's just noisy and bothersome and people coming in and out and it's like I just wanted to kill people.

59
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:41,200
Rym: Yeah, it's not like a normal like a co-working space where you literally just like get a tiny office somewhere.

60
00:03:41,641 --> 00:03:42,955
Rym: Yeah, it's like it's not like we work.

61
00:03:43,177 --> 00:03:43,400
Scott: Anyway.

62
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:56,039
Rym: Yeah, thing is I'm it's weird because I'm in this giant open floor with like hundreds of people in my new place and yet like other people's conversations never really bother me and like it's just it feels like being in a normal office.

63
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:56,420
Rym: It's weird.

64
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,720
Rym: I don't know if there's like white noise generators.

65
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:07,500
Rym: I just don't notice like I got to try to figure out but I can open a ticket to change the temperature of like the area right around my desk.

66
00:04:08,421 --> 00:04:09,667
Rym: So it was a little chilly so I did it.

67
00:04:09,727 --> 00:04:19,644
Rym: I like open this ticket and then like a minute later it gets like noticeably warmer right at my desk and I walked away a little bit and it was the normal temperature away a little bit.

68
00:04:19,665 --> 00:04:20,269
Rym: Mm-hmm.

69
00:04:20,591 --> 00:04:21,540
Rym: It's kind of amazing.

70
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:22,782
Scott: Mm-hmm.

71
00:04:22,802 --> 00:04:24,488
Scott: What happens if someone actually has a good office?

72
00:04:24,548 --> 00:04:31,232
Rym: and yeah, he does everything and uh, you know, so uh, Oh, I can hit a button to play an ad in the live stream.

73
00:04:31,252 --> 00:04:32,056
Rym: That wasn't there before.

74
00:04:32,337 --> 00:04:32,820
Scott: Don't do that.

75
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,241
Scott: All right.

76
00:04:33,282 --> 00:04:40,914
Rym: Well, it's grayed out because I don't think I've been able to thing good I should make an ad for us and hit play and see what happens.

77
00:04:40,934 --> 00:04:41,637
Scott: That would be okay.

78
00:04:41,717 --> 00:04:42,339
Rym: That would be funny.

79
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:46,854
Scott: Would we have to pay YouTube and ourselves for that?

80
00:04:47,035 --> 00:04:48,160
Rym: Maybe if someone clicked on it.

81
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:50,104
Rym: That would be bad.

82
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:50,888
Rym: You'll all click on it.

83
00:04:50,908 --> 00:04:52,978
Rym: Then I have to pay myself money minus the cut.

84
00:04:53,299 --> 00:04:53,460
Rym: Yeah.

85
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,209
Rym: Maybe I won't do that.

86
00:04:54,391 --> 00:04:54,979
Scott: Yeah, don't do that.

87
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,856
Rym: So, uh, there's only one news really cuz I don't feel like talking about anything else.

88
00:04:58,876 --> 00:04:59,760
Rym: and also it's really funny.

89
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:00,401
Rym: Mm-hmm.

90
00:05:00,441 --> 00:05:04,220
Rym: If you're not aware out there, there's these things called Funko Pops.

91
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:17,080
Scott: Alright, so the story of Funko Pop as I see it, right, as someone who's a nerd who sees sort of on the out not into that fandom, but you know from outside the fandom looking in, right, is that obviously nerds always like to collect plastic doodads.

92
00:05:17,421 --> 00:05:17,843
Scott: Yup.

93
00:05:17,883 --> 00:05:22,720
Rym: Especially if those doodads are one, associated with some IP they like and two, there is a set.

94
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,880
Scott: Right, so in college I collected some plastic doodads when I finally had money, but then I stopped.

95
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,873
Rym: I've still got a bunch of those plastic doodads.

96
00:05:28,994 --> 00:05:29,679
Rym: I got that Lupin.

97
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,446
Scott: I got a whole box full of them, but then I stopped.

98
00:05:31,487 --> 00:05:33,274
Scott: cuz I wizened up, right?

99
00:05:33,856 --> 00:05:34,740
Scott: Even that Mech Warrior game.

100
00:05:36,182 --> 00:05:53,060
Scott: Anyway, um, you know, and then what happened was is like sometime after I moved to like New York after college these like vinyl figurines became real popular like the Kid Robot store and stuff like these, you know, stylish high-fashion like fancy vinyl figurines were like all the rage.

101
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,553
Scott: There was a whole geekery about those which is I could respect it.

102
00:05:56,614 --> 00:05:58,200
Scott: like, you know, there was something going on there.

103
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:58,781
Rym: Like I don't know.

104
00:05:58,822 --> 00:06:04,080
Rym: I'm not gonna collect that stuff anymore, but at the same time I have a handful of like high-quality vinyl type things.

105
00:06:04,502 --> 00:06:06,600
Rym: They're really high-quality like they feel good.

106
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:11,540
Scott: So this company Funko Pop appeared at some point and basically they were like there's a barrel there, right?

107
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:16,013
Scott: They were mass at the bottom of this barrel mass market producing that sort of.

108
00:06:16,314 --> 00:06:22,060
Scott: they made it like this kind of toy with every possible licensed property imaginable.

109
00:06:22,441 --> 00:06:31,914
Scott: But what they did is they made everything from like pro athletes to Ninja Turtles to you know obscure characters in a video game that only a few people know.

110
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:48,040
Rym: now prior to this when you Usually when you saw like your favorite rock star from a thing you like in a particular style It was always like an artist in an artist alley at a con Like I draw in this style and I draw all the characters from all the anime you're like in that style.

111
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:59,680
Rym: that was a thing and this company seems to just taking that and remove the soul from it and made this like Mass market right crank out IP for things that don't have enough social currency.

112
00:06:59,881 --> 00:07:00,605
Scott: It's all sort of like.

113
00:07:00,706 --> 00:07:03,280
Scott: it's certainly Beanie Babies with intellectual property.

114
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:14,484
Scott: so the idea was that hey we can sell to people who like our toys and they'll buy any of them and Will also people who care about a particular intellectual property, which everyone cares about Something right.

115
00:07:14,524 --> 00:07:22,011
Scott: as a Transformers fan a football fan a baseball fan, you know metal fan We will have a figure for pretty much everyone.

116
00:07:22,031 --> 00:07:27,969
Scott: So everyone's gonna buy a few of these no matter who they are Right, and that's how we'll make some whole ton of monies.

117
00:07:28,109 --> 00:07:33,785
Scott: and apparently they got enough money from somewhere to produce all these fucking things Zillions of them everywhere.

118
00:07:33,825 --> 00:07:38,480
Rym: Well, I mean it's pretty like the process of making these cannot be very different.

119
00:07:38,561 --> 00:07:41,480
Scott: No, there's obviously a factory that spits out just zillions of them for nothing.

120
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:47,520
Scott: But and then it must cost like 50 cents to make and they charge a lot like dollars for them, right?

121
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:58,755
Scott: but if you look like I knew long ago these things are going down the toilet when I saw them like Stop every single nerd store every single booth at every single con and all the lead like

122
00:07:58,795 --> 00:07:59,998
Rym: a little tower of these and

123
00:08:00,078 --> 00:08:03,617
Scott: all the loot Crates in the universe right specifically the loot crate.

124
00:08:03,658 --> 00:08:09,980
Rym: at this point I'm pretty sure loot crate means the things that are in this box are about to fail in the mass market.

125
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:18,758
Scott: Yes Cuz loot crate is a way for companies that make nerdy shit to dump their excess inventory and still get some money for it because if you just put it on a clearance shelf No one will buy it for any amount of money.

126
00:08:18,778 --> 00:08:18,940
Scott: again.

127
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:30,490
Rym: The anime cons were ahead of the game because the the low tier like anime Sellers it would show up at conventions would make grab boxes of mystery boxes and stuff like that inventory You can't move.

128
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:36,380
Rym: and when you bought him It was 40 bucks for basically a bunch of garbage that they were literally going to throw away if they couldn't sell right?

129
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,986
Scott: So Funko pop.

130
00:08:38,066 --> 00:08:45,160
Scott: when you see so many Funko pop things everywhere Just trying to sell trying so hard to get rid of these things, right?

131
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:49,837
Scott: You see just so so much, you know over production and such not enough demand.

132
00:08:49,858 --> 00:08:50,500
Scott: There was demand.

133
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:50,782
Scott: There were.

134
00:08:50,802 --> 00:08:57,800
Scott: people were into these like almost every nerd I know except for me like has some of these but at the same time people are way into them more than others.

135
00:08:58,062 --> 00:09:00,460
Scott: But the demand did not meet the supply.

136
00:09:00,681 --> 00:09:02,915
Scott: It's not like they were flying off the shelves at the conventions.

137
00:09:02,955 --> 00:09:06,180
Scott: at the end of the convention It'd still be tons of these things at Barnes & Noble.

138
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,335
Scott: There's just tons of them at the local game store.

139
00:09:08,355 --> 00:09:09,060
Scott: There's tons of them.

140
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:12,711
Rym: I guess about them is that I mean I didn't like the aesthetic.

141
00:09:12,892 --> 00:09:13,574
Rym: but that's not.

142
00:09:13,835 --> 00:09:15,420
Rym: that doesn't necessarily mean something's bad.

143
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,613
Scott: There's a lot of things I don't like.

144
00:09:16,674 --> 00:09:17,180
Scott: that succeed.

145
00:09:17,364 --> 00:09:21,952
Rym: Oh, yeah But the aesthetic is basically like those black soulless eyes.

146
00:09:22,373 --> 00:09:29,280
Rym: and as soon as I saw these start to appear everywhere All I could think was that those black soulless eyes are the soulless eyes of the person who's trying to catch this out.

147
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:33,932
Scott: Anyway, so I didn't know this was happening or else I might.

148
00:09:34,012 --> 00:09:38,328
Scott: I sold short but the Funko pop is its own company It's not owned by anything.

149
00:09:38,872 --> 00:09:43,430
Scott: and they made an IPO which seems like the dumbest idea in the universe to go public.

150
00:09:43,571 --> 00:09:47,265
Rym: and if I don't there or not there was an IPO and I Knew anyone involved in it.

151
00:09:47,285 --> 00:09:50,960
Rym: I would have I would have pointed out to them that this is a bad idea.

152
00:09:51,121 --> 00:09:52,669
Rym: Yeah, and this is not just us like.

153
00:09:52,749 --> 00:09:54,680
Rym: Oh hindsight is not the worst idea.

154
00:09:55,202 --> 00:10:05,140
Rym: I a pair as best I can tell part of the reason the IPO does that I think some initial investors like Took their money back and as a result, they needed money to cover debt.

155
00:10:05,943 --> 00:10:07,791
Scott: Yeah, something like that, but that's not shady.

156
00:10:07,811 --> 00:10:08,875
Rym: stuff like that happens all the time.

157
00:10:08,915 --> 00:10:12,836
Scott: Like that's normal business Yeah, but anyway, this IPO is the worst IPO.

158
00:10:12,876 --> 00:10:16,460
Scott: like all time They said I said a starting price anyway.

159
00:10:17,122 --> 00:10:31,980
Rym: It's so bad that when I typed Funko pop IPO into Google to get the article to talk about this on the show every article I see is either the announcement or All these things talking about how crazy this IPO is gonna be like right here, right?

160
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:38,934
Scott: Cuz when you're doing an IPO and it hasn't happened yet you pump the news You do all sorts of press releases and stuff with your numbers that you've worked out.

161
00:10:38,974 --> 00:10:40,540
Scott: Like please buy our stock.

162
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,650
Scott: Here's all the great reasons.

163
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:42,820
Scott: We're gonna perform so well.

164
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,668
Scott: We're making tons of money in this.

165
00:10:44,989 --> 00:10:51,309
Rym: from a little while ago Funko pop IPO could top 245 million more than doubling initial estimate.

166
00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:52,592
Rym: Mm-hmm Funko pop.

167
00:10:52,812 --> 00:10:53,353
Scott: That's a new.

168
00:10:53,373 --> 00:10:56,180
Scott: that's a news created by Funko pop before the IPO.

169
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,943
Scott: That's how I peels.

170
00:10:57,024 --> 00:10:57,988
Scott: every IPO has this.

171
00:10:58,048 --> 00:11:05,095
Scott: any IPO ever has new people pumping the news Full of hype to get people to buy the stock and also to get bots to buy the stock.

172
00:11:05,255 --> 00:11:07,967
Rym: Funko bumps up Size of planned IPO.

173
00:11:07,987 --> 00:11:10,519
Rym: so they raised the size of the IPO as well like their projections.

174
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,579
Rym: now I'm not gonna get into explaining how IPOs really work cuz you don't care and you won't understand any.

175
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,725
Rym: well Yeah, but it's it's.

176
00:11:17,368 --> 00:11:19,799
Rym: it's not as complicated as you'd think.

177
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,886
Rym: it's just not really relevant to this.

178
00:11:22,926 --> 00:11:30,439
Rym: because what's relevant is that as many of you know, I I do some stock investment and I tend to invest in a lot of nerdy stuff.

179
00:11:31,084 --> 00:11:41,047
Rym: But I do it because I understand nerdy stuff Like I know a lot about nerdy company what you want to invest in real estate if you don't know anything about real estate Nerdy things.

180
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:42,279
Scott: so we invest in nerdy things.

181
00:11:43,085 --> 00:11:44,960
Rym: I've made a lot of money on my stocks over the years.

182
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:52,197
Rym: Like I'm not gonna lie about that The reason I have in my opinion and I'm not giving you investment advice.

183
00:11:52,217 --> 00:11:53,220
Rym: This is not advice.

184
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,749
Scott: Hey, everyone call the SEC and they'll shut Rym down.

185
00:11:55,970 --> 00:12:12,583
Rym: Hey, they'll take his patreon monies, but I When I invest whenever I think that Wall Street has an opinion about a nerdy thing But I being the person who is involved in nerdy things Understands it better than they do So.

186
00:12:12,623 --> 00:12:19,535
Rym: for example, I bought a shit ton of Hasbro a long time ago because I was like Hasbro's got the my little pony license And holy shit, is that gonna make that money?

187
00:12:19,555 --> 00:12:22,871
Rym: Mm-hmm or Hasbro's got the Disney Princess license

188
00:12:23,032 --> 00:12:26,480
Scott: and D&D and yeah This is the coast and magic

189
00:12:26,661 --> 00:12:34,440
Rym: I like how I bought a bunch of Toyota stock a long long time ago because they had that scandal about breaks like though the the Accelerators and breaks are failing and killing people.

190
00:12:34,601 --> 00:12:36,011
Scott: You don't want to invest in this company.

191
00:12:36,051 --> 00:12:38,906
Scott: that's depending on buying licenses from people to make stuff.

192
00:12:38,946 --> 00:12:42,339
Scott: you want to invest in the company that has the license and is selling it to funko pop.

193
00:12:42,359 --> 00:12:47,260
Scott: because Even if funko pops don't sell Hasbro still got their money from all the transformers funko pops.

194
00:12:47,441 --> 00:12:49,880
Scott: It doesn't matter whether those funko pops actually sell or not.

195
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,796
Rym: So what happened with the funko pop IPO is not just like ha ha.

196
00:12:53,816 --> 00:12:54,740
Rym: look at this nerd company.

197
00:12:55,282 --> 00:13:07,719
Rym: This is like legit Wall Street people whose job it is to underwrite IPOs Literally had no idea what funko pop was and what its real value proposition was.

198
00:13:08,604 --> 00:13:10,498
Scott: I can imagine the going out of business soon, right?

199
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:16,219
Rym: Uh, so funko pop shares plunged more than 40 percent after the IP.

200
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:22,819
Scott: This is actually really good because it means the CEOs and executives and board members of funko pop won't be mega rich from it.

201
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:26,400
Scott: This was really got more money than we do, but they lost a lot of money.

202
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:34,552
Rym: This was the worst less rich the worst first day for an IPO Full stop in two decades.

203
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:35,957
Scott: What was the one two decades ago?

204
00:13:36,057 --> 00:13:36,740
Rym: I don't even know.

205
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,021
Rym: I don't.

206
00:13:37,261 --> 00:13:43,420
Rym: so they're having to caveat that IPO is really dropped off after the like 2008 like when the market went south.

207
00:13:43,581 --> 00:13:45,239
Scott: Yeah, everyone just gets a VZ now.

208
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:49,133
Scott: Yeah, which I think that's they don't depend on going public to get investment.

209
00:13:49,153 --> 00:13:51,080
Rym: VC has its own problems.

210
00:13:51,181 --> 00:13:55,464
Rym: So I like the pendulum is gonna go back but knows There are many ways.

211
00:13:55,484 --> 00:13:59,200
Scott: there are many ways to get your monies, I wish the pendulum would swing toward just getting a loan.

212
00:13:59,523 --> 00:14:00,739
Scott: No one seems to do that anymore.

213
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:08,380
Rym: It's very interesting to me how little anyone involved in this IPO process seemed to know about like nerd stuff.

214
00:14:08,902 --> 00:14:10,347
Rym: And yet funko like pop.

215
00:14:10,388 --> 00:14:18,555
Rym: this company their entire business model seemed to be Panda to the lowest common denominator of nerds like you'd think.

216
00:14:18,876 --> 00:14:20,200
Rym: they can hit that out of the park.

217
00:14:21,963 --> 00:14:26,020
Rym: But it seems like they are super overvalued and this is all really funny to me.

218
00:14:26,101 --> 00:14:32,020
Scott: I feel like funko pop could have done Well, if they simply produce the right numbers of each funko pop, right?

219
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,634
Scott: It feels like they just made too many of ones that weren't gonna sell.

220
00:14:35,655 --> 00:14:36,980
Scott: and maybe right.

221
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,129
Scott: It's like you just have to calculate like aha.

222
00:14:39,431 --> 00:14:41,520
Scott: This character has this many fans.

223
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:41,842
Scott: It's like.

224
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:45,660
Scott: it's like a. it's like the least popular Harry Potter character, but Harry Potter is still popular.

225
00:14:45,721 --> 00:14:48,000
Scott: Well this many if we have if they have good analytics.

226
00:14:48,301 --> 00:14:52,395
Scott: Well, there's this many people who will collect every single Harry Potter funko pop no matter what and is.

227
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:59,000
Scott: this many people are specifically a Fan of this character judging by the amount of fanfiction and we'll make a few extra like one for each store.

228
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:10,702
Rym: so make this many instead of now you go and there's like a thousand of them and no one wants them, so Part of the reason why I think they had so much trouble is that they had a lot of that private equity money Like.

229
00:15:10,722 --> 00:15:15,100
Scott: that's how a lot of companies they just set it on fire without caring about spending it wisely.

230
00:15:15,461 --> 00:15:16,444
Rym: No, I don't think it's even that.

231
00:15:16,484 --> 00:15:21,500
Rym: the problem with private equity money is that those people want to make money

232
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:21,901
Scott: Mm-hmm,

233
00:15:22,302 --> 00:15:32,823
Rym: and as a result, they're not actually that interested sometimes in the long-term viability of your company Mmm, and there's a lot of issues with the things they might want to do that You may not want to

234
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:32,923
Scott: do.

235
00:15:32,983 --> 00:15:39,871
Scott: are you saying that those are the people who got stock before the IPO because they own they invested And then they sold it once the IPO happened.

236
00:15:39,911 --> 00:15:40,875
Rym: It's not actually stock.

237
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:41,860
Rym: It's way more complicated than that.

238
00:15:42,243 --> 00:15:46,828
Scott: The point is they own part of the company PC as soon as it goes public.

239
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:48,533
Scott: they sell and then the IPO tank.

240
00:15:48,593 --> 00:15:59,491
Rym: if you have a company that say could be worth 10 mil and could make a million dollar profit a year like forever, but you take a hundred mil or 500 mil no one.

241
00:15:59,551 --> 00:16:00,879
Scott: No one can wait a hundred years.

242
00:16:01,602 --> 00:16:03,269
Scott: I mean even I'm not great.

243
00:16:03,289 --> 00:16:08,351
Scott: I'm like against greed, but honestly if I gives you a hundred mil I can't wait a hundred years to give a hundred mil back.

244
00:16:08,773 --> 00:16:23,043
Rym: But basically if Like if your investments are too big your company will have to grow bigger than might actually be viable or than what you might have Actually wanted to do if you didn't take all that money like if you gave GeekNights 500 grand.

245
00:16:23,324 --> 00:16:25,289
Rym: we probably keep doing what we're doing now and quit our jobs.

246
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:33,011
Rym: if you gave us like 500 million dollars I would just buy like we would just.

247
00:16:33,071 --> 00:16:34,760
Rym: I would just retire forever and never do anything.

248
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:39,920
Scott: I would buy a cheap sports team somewhere and then yeah instead of doing GeekNights and then you'd get paid back from that.

249
00:16:40,061 --> 00:16:43,700
Rym: I could make more returns for you by investing that money just back in the market.

250
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:47,419
Scott: I could just buy an index fund and give you half of the interest.

251
00:16:47,821 --> 00:16:51,376
Rym: Yeah, like I couldn't do anything with that money to make GeekNights better.

252
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:52,279
Scott: No, there's no way.

253
00:16:52,420 --> 00:17:02,180
Scott: There's no way GeekNights could make even at the most successful GeekNights If it was like a Broadway show and a TV show on primetime could make back five hundred million dollars.

254
00:17:02,581 --> 00:17:06,940
Rym: but the other thing is that I've never liked Funko pop because it really feels like.

255
00:17:07,481 --> 00:17:13,400
Rym: The only reason this exists at all in the scale that it did was that and this is the same thing again.

256
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,207
Rym: Anime cons are always kind of ahead of this.

257
00:17:15,688 --> 00:17:18,700
Rym: nerds would be fans of some anime in America.

258
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:30,439
Rym: but they want merch because a lot of nerds really want like this social currency to carry around and Officially licensed merch lagged behind the thing that they were into by three to five years.

259
00:17:31,241 --> 00:17:39,300
Rym: As a result they would buy bootleg shit because they really needed a full metal alchemist t-shirt and plastic thing and plush to prove that They are fans of that thing.

260
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:45,380
Scott: Yeah, I just I just got over needing to have a plastic figurine like, you know, 15 some odd years ago.

261
00:17:45,822 --> 00:17:49,680
Scott: And now I'm done with that part of my life and I have a bunch of figurines in the closet and that's it.

262
00:17:50,041 --> 00:18:03,400
Rym: I'm happy to express my fandom for say little witch academia by when talking to other anime fans saying things like hey guys I really like little witch academia, you know in a Gundam I can buy a few Gundams because that's an activity of building them just like Legos.

263
00:18:03,681 --> 00:18:08,280
Scott: There's an activity going on but you buy a Funko pop and you put it on the shelf and it sits there looking at you.

264
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,839
Scott: I guess you spend a bunch of money on that.

265
00:18:11,361 --> 00:18:27,380
Rym: The reason I didn't trust Funko pop in the end was that the business model of selling the social currency That of IPS that you don't own two people who literally build their personal identity Around those IPS and thus that social currency.

266
00:18:28,322 --> 00:18:34,658
Rym: that demographic is not a demographic you want to tie yourself to know as a company and doesn't have a lot of money because then you get.

267
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:41,219
Rym: then you're gonna Turn into like Marvel and DC comics themselves the floppies and the demographic they cater to.

268
00:18:42,582 --> 00:18:50,348
Rym: and I definitely noticed in my nerd dealings that most of the people have money if They're buying the like vinyl nerdy stuff.

269
00:18:50,368 --> 00:18:51,753
Rym: They're not buying the Funko pops.

270
00:18:51,993 --> 00:18:55,979
Rym: They're buying the like much more expensive smaller run limited things.

271
00:18:56,782 --> 00:19:03,840
Rym: They're not more discerning in terms of buying social currency and wrapping their identity up, but they're not buying the Funko pops.

272
00:19:05,242 --> 00:19:10,496
Rym: so this is all just kind of funny and I Laugh at it more than I'm saddened by it.

273
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:16,846
Rym: what anyway?

274
00:19:16,927 --> 00:19:18,980
Rym: things of the day?

275
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,573
Rym: So I gotta say I gotta tip my hat to Scott.

276
00:19:22,136 --> 00:19:24,840
Scott: your thing of the day My thing of the days are always better than your thing of the day.

277
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,450
Scott: It's just this week in particular.

278
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,880
Scott: I had a plus things the day.

279
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:29,839
Rym: Do our thing of the day off?

280
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:37,334
Scott: this is just showing is just a Key example of how much better my things of the day usually are.

281
00:19:37,736 --> 00:19:38,599
Scott: but it's just this week.

282
00:19:38,901 --> 00:19:43,599
Rym: So I was looking at stats though in the forum my things that they get clicked on more often than yours do.

283
00:19:43,659 --> 00:19:43,900
Scott: how do you?

284
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:44,342
Scott: Know that?

285
00:19:44,362 --> 00:19:47,275
Rym: because it says how many times any link I clicked on in any forum post.

286
00:19:47,536 --> 00:19:55,377
Rym: Uh-huh So that's I haven't looked at old threads to see if that still is true But that there's an interesting metric we can use.

287
00:19:55,397 --> 00:19:58,134
Scott: in the future We'll have to make one of those things really get shows two things.

288
00:19:58,194 --> 00:20:01,079
Scott: the day you click one Which you and you think is better like hot or not?

289
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:07,320
Scott: Oh, yeah, you just keeps picking random ones and then at the end it'll be like aha Well, we were gonna do at some point is do a thing of the day Thursday.

290
00:20:07,361 --> 00:20:08,720
Rym: This is like about our Thursday shows.

291
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:21,405
Rym: That's like if we really don't have an idea is we're both gonna pick what we think are our own personal best top 10 things of the day and then try to do some sort of tournament with them and let you guys decide who is truly the king of Things

292
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:25,906
Scott: Thousands of things of the day and how many of them are 404. now, I'd like figure out.

293
00:20:26,509 --> 00:20:28,190
Rym: Yep That's why we haven't done it yet.

294
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:31,989
Scott: I'd have to take me a whole day just to go through my things of the day and figure out which ones.

295
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:36,006
Rym: Meaning this episode is not happening until it's like the worst weather outside.

296
00:20:36,247 --> 00:20:39,198
Rym: It's not gonna happen Someday ten years from now.

297
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:41,010
Rym: We're really out of episode ideas.

298
00:20:42,656 --> 00:20:44,087
Rym: So I'll do my thing today.

299
00:20:44,127 --> 00:20:47,870
Rym: first Because Scott's is just - I can't get over how great this is.

300
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:54,160
Rym: So I chose a Simpsons appropriate thing of the day because I realized that I quote.

301
00:20:54,702 --> 00:20:57,009
Rym: my favorite character on The Simpsons was always Moses like.

302
00:20:57,049 --> 00:21:01,068
Rym: but My second favorite character was always Gil Gunderson.

303
00:21:02,555 --> 00:21:05,187
Rym: All gail old gills eating food tonight.

304
00:21:05,327 --> 00:21:05,488
Rym: Mm-hmm.

305
00:21:06,111 --> 00:21:08,920
Rym: And he's done in that many episodes for what he is is pure gold.

306
00:21:09,382 --> 00:21:17,072
Rym: and I realized that I quote Gil a lot Like some people quote like certain things from The Simpsons like that's their thing Gil's.

307
00:21:17,112 --> 00:21:17,894
Rym: the one I quote.

308
00:21:18,316 --> 00:21:19,862
Rym: and I realized that a bunch of our friends.

309
00:21:20,403 --> 00:21:24,721
Rym: They assumed I was quoting something rightly But they didn't know is from The Simpsons.

310
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,730
Rym: They didn't know who old Gil was.

311
00:21:27,651 --> 00:21:29,120
Scott: I did not know kennel Gil.

312
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:29,582
Rym: get a taste.

313
00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:30,729
Rym: I'll look at that brass ring.

314
00:21:32,271 --> 00:21:35,145
Rym: So this is a compilation of the best of Gil Gunderson.

315
00:21:35,346 --> 00:21:41,830
Scott: Okay, great I'm sure as Rym picked The Simpsons thing today because y'all saw that I had already picked The Simpsons thing of the day.

316
00:21:42,515 --> 00:21:47,690
Scott: This is steamed hams Except it's a custom guitar hero song.

317
00:21:47,790 --> 00:22:01,189
Scott: apparently there's like a mini genre of this on YouTube that I wasn't aware of where you'll take something that is Definitely not rhythm a rhythm song and then make a guitar hero track custom guitar hero track to it.

318
00:22:01,851 --> 00:22:12,025
Scott: So this is literally just that scene from The Simpsons where Super Nintendo Chalmers goes to Skinner's house for dinner Like top five favorite scenes in the entire run.

319
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:20,610
Scott: then on top of it There's a guitar hero fretboard with the dots coming down that you can I guess play if you've got a modded guitar hero set up.

320
00:22:21,112 --> 00:22:21,353
Rym: It is.

321
00:22:21,554 --> 00:22:25,050
Scott: and if you go on YouTube and look at related videos, there's tons of these things.

322
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:28,650
Scott: But this is the best of them by far kind of like a rhythm heaven.

323
00:22:28,731 --> 00:22:31,149
Rym: Like that's another thing people would make like fake rhythm heavens.

324
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:35,324
Rym: Yeah, and the pony one was probably the best one of those should just put DDR hours instead.

325
00:22:35,344 --> 00:22:35,424
Scott: Yeah.

326
00:22:36,006 --> 00:22:46,750
Rym: Yeah Well, so I did find someone made arrows and I found this by accident But it seems like the thing that I would seek out or that I would have secretly made.

327
00:22:47,272 --> 00:22:50,990
Rym: But someone made pretty good arrows to piss Admiral dildo captain.

328
00:22:51,379 --> 00:22:52,731
Scott: Oh, but yeah but anyway the the.

329
00:22:53,032 --> 00:23:06,189
Scott: what's fun about this is that the the notes you have to play not only include all of the dialogue between Skinner and Chalmers but also the background music like didn't do which you call steamed hams.

330
00:23:06,369 --> 00:23:16,588
Rym: Yes The Aurora Borealis The see I got literally top five Simpsons scenes like.

331
00:23:16,608 --> 00:23:23,270
Rym: I Cannot express to you how much I like this thing today because of how much I like this scene.

332
00:23:23,712 --> 00:23:26,609
Rym: So Scott you make a fine steamed ham.

333
00:23:28,892 --> 00:23:36,425
Rym: In the moment we were at gamer X East it was exactly what it purported to be And we have a weekend to relax.

334
00:23:36,968 --> 00:23:37,370
Rym: and then next.

335
00:23:38,861 --> 00:23:42,559
Rym: well, we gotta prepare but Next weekend is PAX Unplugged.

336
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:43,081
Scott: Oh crap.

337
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:45,110
Rym: It is the tabletop only packs.

338
00:23:45,371 --> 00:23:50,267
Rym: We will be there enforcing and doing an event on Saturday and tabletop tourney for 3 30 p.m.

339
00:23:50,287 --> 00:23:50,990
Rym: For two hours.

340
00:23:51,891 --> 00:23:53,618
Rym: It's just gonna be great and you should be there.

341
00:23:53,779 --> 00:23:58,539
Scott: the badges for PAX East one on sale today Which for you is probably already yesterday.

342
00:23:58,559 --> 00:23:59,544
Rym: They're already sold out.

343
00:23:59,584 --> 00:24:00,046
Rym: You're fucked.

344
00:24:00,086 --> 00:24:01,050
Rym: The hotels are sold out.

345
00:24:01,693 --> 00:24:04,343
Scott: If you're gonna be there though, so away probably.

346
00:24:04,605 --> 00:24:05,930
Rym: yep, we're gonna be enforced.

347
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:10,105
Scott: We'd haven't had like some panel approved, but it's like 99 submissions are not even open.

348
00:24:10,145 --> 00:24:14,506
Scott: Yeah, there's 99% chance We're gonna enforce there again, and we'll be there again.

349
00:24:14,526 --> 00:24:17,235
Scott: We already got 100% chance will enforce.

350
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:19,101
Scott: cuz we're already they could reject us.

351
00:24:19,422 --> 00:24:20,285
Scott: No, we're counting.

352
00:24:20,365 --> 00:24:21,930
Scott: I'm accounting for that possibility.

353
00:24:22,171 --> 00:24:25,882
Rym: I don't think they reject people who are already registered.

354
00:24:25,903 --> 00:24:29,096
Scott: Listen, there's a non zero percent chance They could decide.

355
00:24:29,116 --> 00:24:29,479
Scott: you know what?

356
00:24:29,499 --> 00:24:30,668
Scott: We don't like those veganized guys.

357
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:33,623
Rym: Yeah I mean there's a chance that they could just cancel PAX East like.

358
00:24:33,643 --> 00:24:33,864
Rym: well.

359
00:24:34,507 --> 00:24:34,688
Scott: Yeah.

360
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:36,153
Scott: Sorry guys We also have to account for that.

361
00:24:37,036 --> 00:24:37,337
Rym: You know what?

362
00:24:37,438 --> 00:24:38,221
Rym: I don't account for that.

363
00:24:38,381 --> 00:24:42,466
Scott: Okay in the not accounting for things like that We're a hundred percent going to be there.

364
00:24:42,668 --> 00:24:46,844
Rym: Yep I mean that is like worrying about the existential solipsistic nature of the universe.

365
00:24:46,864 --> 00:24:52,570
Rym: Like I don't roll that Determination into my chances of whether or not packs will happen anyway.

366
00:24:52,911 --> 00:24:57,830
Rym: But I actually only Saturday is sold out because PAX East is a good packs.

367
00:24:58,092 --> 00:25:06,910
Rym: But it's now four days Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday Yep, but PAX East has probably the highest percent percentage of day trippers like people who literally only come for a day.

368
00:25:07,153 --> 00:25:08,250
Scott: Also, there's hotel issues.

369
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:14,450
Scott: We tried to book a two-bedroom for Wednesday night Thursday night Friday night Saturday night Sunday night check out on Monday.

370
00:25:14,511 --> 00:25:18,234
Rym: there are zero of those at Hotels that matter.

371
00:25:18,314 --> 00:25:23,030
Rym: and I say that matter because the main problem with PAX East is that it is the biggest packs by.

372
00:25:23,291 --> 00:25:26,870
Scott: People keep taking shuttles to these faraway hotels on the other side of town.

373
00:25:27,494 --> 00:25:28,844
Scott: Only we don't do that shit.

374
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:35,089
Rym: There are only Arguably four or five hotels that are within a reasonable distance.

375
00:25:35,129 --> 00:25:41,735
Scott: Yeah So the hotel that we wanted to stay at their two bedrooms didn't have Wednesday night So I had to.

376
00:25:41,896 --> 00:25:43,329
Scott: we got to one bedrooms.

377
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:48,090
Scott: It's not ideal in a different hotel that is still right next to that one.

378
00:25:48,191 --> 00:25:50,510
Rym: This nearly doubled our costs for PAX East.

379
00:25:50,771 --> 00:25:54,704
Rym: I'm telling you guys PAX South cost less to go to then PAX East.

380
00:25:55,005 --> 00:26:00,190
Scott: no matter where you live Even no matter where you live on earth PAX South is cheaper than packs.

381
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:04,945
Rym: If you live in Southie and are just going to like walk to PAX East.

382
00:26:04,965 --> 00:26:05,246
Rym: Yes.

383
00:26:05,266 --> 00:26:05,868
Rym: This is cheaper.

384
00:26:05,909 --> 00:26:07,072
Scott: Sure That's right.

385
00:26:07,393 --> 00:26:10,182
Rym: But if you live in New York PAX South is cheaper than PAX East.

386
00:26:10,323 --> 00:26:18,210
Scott: Mm-hmm, and especially now that there's a fourth day If you can get to PAX East without using a car from your house, then it's cheaper.

387
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:18,952
Scott: otherwise not.

388
00:26:19,654 --> 00:26:28,842
Rym: but yeah, it's gonna be a real busy time for us because right after PAX East or PAX Unplugged is Holidays and then more holidays and then we got New Year's mag.

389
00:26:28,882 --> 00:26:35,248
Rym: fast packs unplug or pack PAX South one two three boom boom boom and then PAX East is like right after that.

390
00:26:35,348 --> 00:26:46,240
Rym: so anime Boston is great and really the only reason we stopped going to anime Boston is that I need a break between all that Nonsense and the nonsense that happens starting in May.

391
00:26:46,943 --> 00:26:49,222
Rym: So yeah, we got a lot of cons coming up Mm-hmm.

392
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:53,605
Rym: Otherwise follow scops YouTube channel and my youtube channel because there's a ton of crap there.

393
00:26:53,706 --> 00:26:57,778
Scott: all the other internet services That you can think of social media networks and whatever.

394
00:26:57,858 --> 00:27:01,769
Scott: look for me Rym and or GeekNights on those things because we are there.

395
00:27:02,712 --> 00:27:05,001
Rym: So snacks because Thursdays is like.

396
00:27:05,021 --> 00:27:07,170
Scott: are you sure we didn't do the show already?

397
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:11,289
Rym: I could did a cursory like half-assed search.

398
00:27:11,752 --> 00:27:13,583
Rym: Okay, and I don't know if we did it.

399
00:27:13,785 --> 00:27:17,566
Rym: if we did it in the past I'm sure someone will say something if no one says anything.

400
00:27:17,586 --> 00:27:18,270
Scott: That's fine.

401
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:21,080
Scott: Let's let's let's be pedantic cuz that's.

402
00:27:21,221 --> 00:27:22,988
Scott: that's how GeekNights do right.

403
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:23,610
Rym: Wikipedia.

404
00:27:23,911 --> 00:27:28,165
Rym: What is a portion of food smaller than a regular meal?

405
00:27:28,366 --> 00:27:28,547
Scott: What?

406
00:27:28,707 --> 00:27:29,510
Scott: how big is a meal?

407
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:30,111
Rym: What if I?

408
00:27:30,131 --> 00:27:31,054
Rym: so let's go to the Wikipedia.

409
00:27:31,094 --> 00:27:35,448
Rym: wait, so there's Wikipedia articles on both food measuring calories like.

410
00:27:35,849 --> 00:27:40,410
Rym: so Scott Do you want to argue about what constitutes food or what constitutes a meal a meal?

411
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:43,158
Scott: Cuz the snack is smaller than a regular meal meal.

412
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:45,345
Rym: a meal is an eating occasion.

413
00:27:45,445 --> 00:27:49,689
Rym: eating has its own Wikipedia page That takes place at a certain time.

414
00:27:50,884 --> 00:27:58,850
Rym: Oh That actually sets us up pretty well and includes Specific prepared food or the food eaten on that occasion.

415
00:27:59,431 --> 00:28:01,497
Rym: Okay, so meals are scheduled.

416
00:28:01,798 --> 00:28:02,941
Rym: snacks are unscheduled.

417
00:28:03,001 --> 00:28:03,743
Scott: I agree with this.

418
00:28:03,924 --> 00:28:09,501
Scott: snacks are the things you eat in between Breakfast lunch dinner and not dessert either now.

419
00:28:09,561 --> 00:28:11,347
Rym: Yeah, I would argue if you it's like.

420
00:28:11,448 --> 00:28:11,829
Scott: it's like.

421
00:28:11,849 --> 00:28:14,490
Scott: oh I already ate breakfast which is a nice breakfast sandwich.

422
00:28:14,671 --> 00:28:16,038
Scott: It's not yet time for lunch.

423
00:28:16,078 --> 00:28:21,383
Scott: some pizza, but I'm hungry and it's morning I will eat this fruit and that counts as a snack.

424
00:28:21,483 --> 00:28:23,130
Scott: or oh it is lunches past.

425
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:26,162
Scott: I already ate pizza and I'm not yet home to cook a dinner.

426
00:28:26,182 --> 00:28:29,215
Scott: I am still at work, but I am hungry And it's three o'clock.

427
00:28:29,276 --> 00:28:31,166
Scott: Let me eat this granola bar.

428
00:28:31,206 --> 00:28:31,830
Scott: That is a snack.

429
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:34,469
Rym: So I think the scheduling aspect is what makes the difference.

430
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:40,290
Rym: Primarily so that means that if you are the kind of person who eats second breakfast, that is not a snack.

431
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:50,690
Rym: That is just another meal and you're gonna get fat or your hobbit All right, so I I think we need to argue about what food is but I actually I'm gonna click on this Wikipedia article.

432
00:28:51,811 --> 00:28:56,466
Rym: All right food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for an organ.

433
00:28:56,587 --> 00:28:57,550
Scott: I agree with that anyway.

434
00:28:58,392 --> 00:29:00,353
Scott: so Snacking like.

435
00:29:00,393 --> 00:29:02,864
Scott: I guess I don't remember what snacks I ate when I was a vivid.

436
00:29:03,145 --> 00:29:04,652
Rym: I actually yeah, baby I don't.

437
00:29:04,692 --> 00:29:11,183
Rym: but from elementary school on I have a Perfect memory of the kinds of snacks that I ate.

438
00:29:11,203 --> 00:29:11,344
Scott: Yep.

439
00:29:11,384 --> 00:29:12,410
Scott: There are many snacks I ate.

440
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:17,728
Scott: I ate a cup of yogurt with fruit on the bottom when I was a kid on the bottom.

441
00:29:17,748 --> 00:29:18,270
Rym: I hated yogurt.

442
00:29:18,391 --> 00:29:19,418
Rym: I never ate yogurt as a kid.

443
00:29:19,459 --> 00:29:20,345
Rym: That shit was disgusting.

444
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:20,990
Scott: I like yogurt.

445
00:29:21,373 --> 00:29:22,501
Scott: I had to have fruit on the bottom.

446
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:23,690
Scott: just yogurt was no good.

447
00:29:24,031 --> 00:29:34,710
Rym: I also liked jelly to up to a point and then at some point in my young childhood I decided that jelly was bullshit, right and I stopped eating jelly of any kind until I became an adult and I started eating jelly again.

448
00:29:34,811 --> 00:29:35,245
Scott: Okay

449
00:29:36,133 --> 00:29:52,783
Rym: Others Remember so a thing I would do when I was a young kid and it's so specific and I remember this partly because it came Up in conversation recently because I once fell down the stairs and hurt my neck real bad had to take a ride in an ambulance Mm-hmm, and I remember the moment when I fell down the stairs.

450
00:29:53,084 --> 00:29:57,118
Rym: My mom thought I was pushed by a ghost But I actually just slipped.

451
00:29:57,338 --> 00:30:09,490
Rym: and I remember so specifically that my heel of my left foot Brushed the front of the next step instead of landing firmly on the step and then I slid like Forward off of it and that caused me to roll down the stairs.

452
00:30:10,073 --> 00:30:21,870
Rym: But just as the reason I was distracted walking down the stairs It was jelly was that I had been in the kitchen eating snacks Right before this and I ran upstairs.

453
00:30:21,971 --> 00:30:22,816
Rym: I don't remember why.

454
00:30:22,836 --> 00:30:25,210
Rym: I went upstairs to do something and then I came back.

455
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:33,610
Rym: I was coming back down the stairs and I was thinking to myself Should I eat the cheese it and then the alphabets?

456
00:30:34,272 --> 00:30:38,989
Rym: Well, like one of the other or should I combine them before I put them in my mouth?

457
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:42,038
Rym: Yeah, well, why savory alphabet?

458
00:30:42,139 --> 00:30:43,644
Scott: alphabets are like a gross.

459
00:30:43,664 --> 00:30:45,530
Scott: They're basically Cheerios in a different shape.

460
00:30:45,651 --> 00:30:46,295
Rym: They were sweeter.

461
00:30:46,315 --> 00:30:46,838
Rym: They had like sugar.

462
00:30:46,858 --> 00:30:47,523
Rym: I had sugar in there.

463
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:52,142
Rym: I never ate discuss Alphabets in a bowl without milk and I'm one bowl of that.

464
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:54,030
Rym: and I also had a bowl of cheese.

465
00:30:54,331 --> 00:30:54,953
Scott: What the hell's wrong.

466
00:30:55,214 --> 00:30:59,089
Rym: and I remember vaguely that I had some sort of rhythm to like how many of each I would eat.

467
00:30:59,833 --> 00:31:01,243
Scott: So I remember a lot like cheeses.

468
00:31:01,303 --> 00:31:02,170
Scott: I should buy cheeses again.

469
00:31:02,431 --> 00:31:02,491
Scott: I

470
00:31:02,551 --> 00:31:22,570
Rym: used to actually through elementary school middle school high school I actually thought a lot about snacking like I would prepare snacks like they were meals like I'd come home from high school and I would like go to the kitchen and get out like three kinds of cheese and like Make all these different slices and like arrange them on a plate with crackers and croutons and peanuts

471
00:31:23,391 --> 00:31:23,752
Scott: Probably

472
00:31:23,792 --> 00:31:26,122
Rym: like a third of a pound of cheese.

473
00:31:26,242 --> 00:31:28,070
Scott: all told I would just go into the kitchen.

474
00:31:28,233 --> 00:31:33,890
Rym: I would sit at the computer Eating this cheese and snacks while I was doing whatever it is.

475
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:35,857
Rym: I did on computers before the internet was really

476
00:31:35,897 --> 00:31:50,947
Scott: all I did if I was hungry and I would go into the kitchen and try To find something and I take it and eat it and then I'd go back and then if I was still hungry I'd go back again and get something else and was still hungry go back again Get something else and repeat but I would never eat the same thing two times in a day.

477
00:31:51,972 --> 00:31:53,057
Rym: You you're weird about that.

478
00:31:53,117 --> 00:31:57,515
Rym: even now, you know, we'll be like, hey, let's get some Italian food You'll be like I had Italian food.

479
00:31:57,575 --> 00:32:02,430
Scott: Okay, so if it's a meal, I can't have the same scheduled meal two days in a row.

480
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:05,527
Scott: So if I ate Indian food yesterday, I can't eat Indian today.

481
00:32:05,648 --> 00:32:09,243
Rym: higher Ethnic class of food is what's covered.

482
00:32:09,444 --> 00:32:13,957
Scott: Yeah, if I ate Italian food yesterday American food two days in a row.

483
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,830
Scott: if I ate hamburger yesterday, I don't get hamburger today.

484
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:18,196
Rym: But would you eat a hot dog today?

485
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,025
Rym: Is that the same class of food?

486
00:32:20,447 --> 00:32:24,564
Rym: Probably not Okay, but yet all Indian food is the same is pad.

487
00:32:24,584 --> 00:32:27,338
Rym: See you and pad kebab Those are two different kinds of food.

488
00:32:28,041 --> 00:32:29,770
Scott: if I ate Thai food yesterday won't eat that food.

489
00:32:30,352 --> 00:32:32,278
Rym: Okay, so you've just got racist food preferences.

490
00:32:32,418 --> 00:32:38,639
Scott: Anyway, the point is just saying if it's a snack Right say like a banana, right?

491
00:32:38,859 --> 00:32:39,702
Scott: Well, that's not a meal.

492
00:32:39,723 --> 00:32:41,750
Scott: I can eat one banana each day.

493
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:48,976
Scott: I just can't eat a tube banana in the same day unless it's some extenuating circumstance like long bike ride After a bike ride.

494
00:32:49,157 --> 00:32:50,644
Rym: So the other day I ran a half marathon.

495
00:32:50,664 --> 00:32:51,930
Scott: We have free bananas for you.

496
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:53,364
Scott: Well, I guess I will eat ten of them.

497
00:32:53,566 --> 00:32:59,352
Rym: the other day I ran a half marathon and when I run a half marathon usually means I run to some distant point and then I take the Subway home.

498
00:32:59,694 --> 00:32:59,835
Rym: Mm-hmm.

499
00:33:00,056 --> 00:33:02,408
Rym: So cuz I don't want to run a big loop cuz I'll get bored.

500
00:33:02,428 --> 00:33:06,538
Rym: Yes I ran up to the top Manhattan and There's fucking nothing up there.

501
00:33:07,001 --> 00:33:08,910
Scott: Like there's like a fruit stand in the corner.

502
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:12,963
Scott: No, I'm talking like 225th Street even a dirty hot water dog.

503
00:33:13,083 --> 00:33:13,765
Rym: So up there.

504
00:33:13,805 --> 00:33:14,748
Rym: There's no street food.

505
00:33:14,808 --> 00:33:17,093
Rym: on a Saturday There's delis.

506
00:33:17,134 --> 00:33:19,844
Rym: that looked so bad that I would rather like I wouldn't.

507
00:33:20,004 --> 00:33:21,490
Scott: you can get some yellow food group from there.

508
00:33:22,172 --> 00:33:24,100
Rym: Uh, yeah, I did not trust the yellow food group in that place.

509
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,690
Scott: You know wrapped in sealed yellow food group.

510
00:33:27,012 --> 00:33:29,629
Rym: Well, so on my body rejects food like that at this point.

511
00:33:30,611 --> 00:33:32,256
Scott: Like not hungry though.

512
00:33:32,336 --> 00:33:34,081
Rym: I would read no matter how hungry I am.

513
00:33:34,462 --> 00:33:36,027
Rym: I'd rather go hungry than eat a Twinkie.

514
00:33:36,609 --> 00:33:41,382
Scott: I mean I've never been hungry enough to eat the Twinkie.

515
00:33:41,402 --> 00:33:45,345
Scott: not they don't make Twinkies anymore But there is a point at which I will eat.

516
00:33:45,446 --> 00:33:50,003
Rym: when I was a kid I would eat like two packs of Twinkies and I actually didn't like Twinkies.

517
00:33:50,023 --> 00:33:52,130
Scott: I was all about the ring ding ring.

518
00:33:53,034 --> 00:33:59,389
Scott: So I like those hostess cupcakes, but I like those are okay But I like the non chocolate one one.

519
00:33:59,651 --> 00:34:03,385
Scott: There was a snack that I had a lot when I was high school and such with cakes.

520
00:34:03,585 --> 00:34:10,270
Scott: No, it was a box full of Not real ring dings, but these you would get into it.

521
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:13,630
Scott: There were these little plastically wrapped two tiny ring dings.

522
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:17,630
Scott: So you'd go in there and grab and open the plastic and there'd be two tiny ring dings.

523
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:18,614
Rym: How tiny cuz.

524
00:34:18,695 --> 00:34:20,043

525
00:34:20,083 --> 00:34:21,149
Rym: Bing I get the bot.

526
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:25,664
Rym: Okay Cuz I had the box of zebra cakes and they'd always come with individually wrapped plastic things.

527
00:34:25,684 --> 00:34:27,610
Rym: that had two zebra cakes each Mm-hmm.

528
00:34:27,953 --> 00:34:28,436
Scott: But yeah, I was like.

529
00:34:28,456 --> 00:34:31,170
Scott: it was like mini ring dings in a box and you get two at a time.

530
00:34:31,391 --> 00:34:32,114
Rym: so I ran all.

531
00:34:32,174 --> 00:34:44,029
Rym: I ran from my apartment all the way to the top of Manhattan and it was like I ran like 14 or 15 miles and I Needed to eat something and there's nothing up there except the gentrifying is happening.

532
00:34:44,692 --> 00:34:51,010
Rym: So there's this like super overpriced bullshit food seller type supermarket in the middle of this.

533
00:34:51,291 --> 00:34:59,653
Rym: Uh-huh, so I go in there and I basically bought like four bananas and a much more of those bananas way too much money Like 40 cents each.

534
00:34:59,933 --> 00:35:08,538
Rym: Okay, and a small bag of clementines and I just ate them all as I rode the subway home Because the biker eating a bike ride.

Rym: It was like eat oranges eat lemons If you have to it's other snacks that I see.

539
00:35:19,906 --> 00:35:20,610
Scott: it's weird like this.

540
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:24,410
Scott: I gotta address something the snacks I eat back in the day or nothing like the snacks I eat today.

541
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:28,470
Scott: Oh back at some point I changed from one kind of snack to a different kind.

542
00:35:28,731 --> 00:35:34,982
Rym: So I when I was like when I was elementary school up through high school The primary snack I ate was savory.

543
00:35:35,404 --> 00:35:41,744
Rym: usually snack mixes Like doodads was my favorite snack mix in the world like that when doodads disappeared.

544
00:35:42,225 --> 00:35:43,329
Rym: I literally do.

545
00:35:43,369 --> 00:35:45,537
Rym: that is I don't know if they were sold around.

546
00:35:45,557 --> 00:35:47,545
Scott: the things I ate before right.

547
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:48,850
Scott: I ate the mini ring ding.

548
00:35:49,412 --> 00:35:51,161
Scott: I ate the string cheese.

549
00:35:51,181 --> 00:35:52,930
Scott: You get one string cheese, right?

550
00:35:54,012 --> 00:35:55,058
Scott: I would eat yet.

551
00:35:55,098 --> 00:35:57,170
Scott: I don't know if they still make these as a kudos.

552
00:35:57,933 --> 00:36:02,690
Rym: Like imagine checks and checks makes but like way more flavorful, okay, so I eat these kudos bars.

553
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:05,004
Scott: I don't know if they still make them but what they are.

554
00:36:05,025 --> 00:36:05,890
Rym: I remember those things.

555
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:06,914
Rym: I did not like those things.

556
00:36:07,075 --> 00:36:10,550
Scott: So imagine like nowadays they have bars like kind bar, right?

557
00:36:10,931 --> 00:36:13,670
Rym: Oh my god, my by crave doodads so much now.

558
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:18,970
Scott: So a kind bar is kind of like this stiff granola bar that's supposed to be healthy or whatever.

559
00:36:19,191 --> 00:36:24,970
Scott: Right a kudos bar is basically that with absolutely no pretending to be healthy, right?

560
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:33,109
Scott: It's it's granola filled with like chocolate chips and some kind of sticky sugar to hold it together and then 100% sealed in chocolate.

561
00:36:34,071 --> 00:36:36,963
Scott: This chocolate on every edge like that ice cream on a stick.

562
00:36:36,983 --> 00:36:38,570
Scott: That's just chocolate with the ice cream inside of it.

563
00:36:39,115 --> 00:36:39,702
Scott: It's like that.

564
00:36:39,783 --> 00:36:44,984
Scott: so it's like yeah It's a granola bar that does not pretend to be a healthy kind or whatever.

565
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:47,070
Scott: crud with those like Clif bar.

566
00:36:47,373 --> 00:36:48,890
Scott: It's like no no, no, this is chocolate.

567
00:36:49,693 --> 00:36:50,279
Rym: It's interesting.

568
00:36:50,502 --> 00:36:54,584
Rym: I don't treat Bars as snacks like I. never I never.

569
00:36:54,644 --> 00:36:55,430
Scott: a bar is a snack.

570
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:56,590
Rym: Yeah, so here's the thing.

571
00:36:56,650 --> 00:37:01,650
Rym: I never but I never eat those kinds of things in the context of I'm sitting here and I'm hungry.

572
00:37:02,172 --> 00:37:07,368
Rym: I only ever eat those things in the context of I am on a long sporting thing and I need to bring.

573
00:37:07,448 --> 00:37:08,070
Scott: I'm talking about.

574
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,355
Scott: You know the olden days, right?

575
00:37:09,395 --> 00:37:12,448
Scott: I would all see, you know yogurt with the fruit on the bottom and eat.

576
00:37:13,592 --> 00:37:17,184
Rym: I mostly eat things that were like actual fruit like an actual banana.

577
00:37:17,445 --> 00:37:19,150
Scott: Oh pretzel stick out all pretzel stick.

578
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:22,866
Scott: The thing with pretzel stick right is that we get the big rods.

579
00:37:22,926 --> 00:37:23,790
Scott: rods are the way to go.

580
00:37:24,272 --> 00:37:26,461
Scott: I would always eat two pretzel rod.

581
00:37:26,943 --> 00:37:27,706
Rym: I didn't like cigar.

582
00:37:27,767 --> 00:37:28,550
Rym: I just keep eating them.

583
00:37:28,611 --> 00:37:30,290
Rym: Just hold it in my mouth like a cigar and suck on it.

584
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:31,334
Scott: Yeah, two pretzel rod.

585
00:37:31,354 --> 00:37:35,693
Scott: and the way I'd eat it is I'd eat all the salt first and then I need the pretzel Right.

586
00:37:36,035 --> 00:37:38,170
Scott: Yeah, and then I would do it through the other pretzel.

587
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:43,385
Rym: I pretty much when I snacked I only wanted cheese and snack mix type things and nuts.

588
00:37:44,047 --> 00:37:46,230
Scott: if it was a cheese situation It was the string cheese.

589
00:37:46,351 --> 00:37:53,843
Scott: But actually when I was way younger you would I would get the thing that was Four crackers a red plastic stick and a little cheese bucket.

590
00:37:54,225 --> 00:37:58,735
Rym: Oh when I was in elementary school I love those in first grade I eat like two or three of them.

591
00:37:58,836 --> 00:38:00,243
Scott: one go in first grade.

592
00:38:00,323 --> 00:38:09,530
Scott: in the toy section of the room There was a bowl a big bowl like a mixing bowl Yeah And it was 100% full with red plastic sticks that were cleaned off after everyone ate and tossed.

593
00:38:10,373 --> 00:38:13,366
Scott: It was like there must have been a thousands of red sticks in this bowl.

594
00:38:13,386 --> 00:38:14,230
Scott: It was great.

595
00:38:14,491 --> 00:38:20,558
Rym: Yep, so I got to address something because in the stream a lot of people to get you the fact that I stopped eating jelly And they all have the same question.

596
00:38:20,578 --> 00:38:22,548
Rym: So what'd you put on your peanut butter and jelly?

597
00:38:22,708 --> 00:38:23,050
Rym: You know what?

598
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,376
Rym: I'm not I'm gonna be blunt.

599
00:38:24,838 --> 00:38:27,090
Rym: I think peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are fucking disgusting.

600
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:27,732
Scott: No, they're great.

601
00:38:28,053 --> 00:38:30,260
Rym: I and I like savory sweet combinations.

602
00:38:30,661 --> 00:38:31,463
Rym: I like peanut butter.

603
00:38:31,483 --> 00:38:33,690
Rym: I like peanut butter sandwiches peanut butter toast.

604
00:38:34,232 --> 00:38:37,362
Rym: I like jelly preserves and marmalade and all those things.

605
00:38:37,723 --> 00:38:40,853
Rym: peanut butter and jelly on white bread is Disgusting.

606
00:38:40,873 --> 00:38:40,993
Scott: Okay.

607
00:38:41,013 --> 00:38:41,657
Scott: So here's the thing.

608
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:44,250
Scott: white bread is disgusting has to be wheat bread.

609
00:38:44,712 --> 00:38:45,113
Scott: I can't do.

610
00:38:45,153 --> 00:38:45,274
Scott: no.

611
00:38:45,294 --> 00:38:47,662
Rym: white peanut butter and jelly on bread is disgusting.

612
00:38:47,843 --> 00:38:49,670
Rym: Oh, no, no, I do not like that.

613
00:38:50,111 --> 00:38:50,593
Scott: It's so good.

614
00:38:51,436 --> 00:38:51,998
Scott: It's a staple.

615
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,130
Rym: But what really amazes me is that as a kid?

616
00:38:56,151 --> 00:39:06,570
Rym: I would eat snacks all and when I say kid, I mean all the way through high school I would eat snacks that are bigger than meals I eat today Like I would get home from school and maybe added the snacks together.

617
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:19,046
Rym: Yeah, I'd literally eat like a third a pound of cheese and like half a box of crackers and just like wall I was fucking around on the computer Pretty much right before dinner and then I'd eat dinner and I'd be totally fine.

618
00:39:19,087 --> 00:39:22,649
Rym: Yeah nowadays I basically like I almost never eat snacks.

619
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:27,909
Scott: So that's the thing is like in college snacks are all over the place because food was hard to get.

620
00:39:27,929 --> 00:39:29,136
Rym: yeah I was dead in college.

621
00:39:29,177 --> 00:39:29,438
Rym: That's it.

622
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,425
Rym: No, it wasn't snacks.

623
00:39:30,445 --> 00:39:35,544
Scott: That was fuel like Calories I consume just like food all over the place random who knows what.

624
00:39:35,605 --> 00:39:39,190
Rym: right if you got calories in college You fucking ate it cuz you didn't know when the next calories.

625
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:43,286
Scott: Yeah, but then once you know entered the real world like the snacking.

626
00:39:43,346 --> 00:39:44,250
Rym: so there's no animals.

627
00:39:44,331 --> 00:39:49,730
Rym: Right, if you like you rescue certain kinds of animals They'll do a thing where they're food aggressive because they were deprived of food.

628
00:39:50,172 --> 00:39:53,450
Rym: So when they have access to food, they don't trust that they'll still have access to be eat all of it.

629
00:39:53,751 --> 00:40:04,608
Rym: I was food aggressive in college and it wasn't until I had like several years in a row of having money and literally like Going to the grocery store and just buying whatever I wanted instead of thinking I can afford $14 worth of groceries.

630
00:40:05,471 --> 00:40:10,910
Scott: Yeah, but nowadays like I've almost eliminated all like, you know, there were times when I would be snacking right?

631
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:11,681
Scott: I switched from.

632
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:16,490
Scott: you know I stopped eating yogurt with fruit on the bottom and started eating the fah-yay Greek yogurt with the fruit next to it.

633
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:18,939
Rym: Yeah, I went on to the ciggas and that's where it's the only yogurt.

634
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:19,602
Scott: It's gross.

635
00:40:19,742 --> 00:40:20,485
Rym: It's so good.

636
00:40:20,505 --> 00:40:20,967
Scott: It's gross.

637
00:40:21,348 --> 00:40:23,697
Rym: So good Try the cream ciggas.

638
00:40:23,998 --> 00:40:24,861
Rym: It's in the flat bit.

639
00:40:25,082 --> 00:40:25,624
Rym: Try it once.

640
00:40:25,685 --> 00:40:26,367
Rym: It's not what you think.

641
00:40:26,508 --> 00:40:27,050
Scott: No, it's no good.

642
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:27,774
Rym: It's real good.

643
00:40:27,995 --> 00:40:28,538
Scott: Why would I do that?

644
00:40:28,558 --> 00:40:30,047
Scott: when I can stick with my fah-yay is okay.

645
00:40:30,691 --> 00:40:33,121
Rym: I mean, I only like the fah-yay with the honey though.

646
00:40:33,141 --> 00:40:34,407
Scott: Maybe all of them are good.

647
00:40:34,427 --> 00:40:47,499
Scott: There's so many flavors kiwis Pear berries so mangoes when I snack Cuz when I start.

648
00:40:47,539 --> 00:40:52,229
Rym: when I worked at IBM like way back in the day I snacked all the time for the vending machines because I was just always hungry.

649
00:40:53,452 --> 00:41:00,869
Rym: But now I work in a place that just has like free snacks all the time And it's funny because they definitely want you to like be healthy about it.

650
00:41:01,271 --> 00:41:13,609
Rym: So like most of the snacks are like bean crisp type things But they know there is garbage food if you want it, but it's like here's a tiny wrapper with one Oreo cookie in it.

651
00:41:14,212 --> 00:41:16,507
Rym: Mmm, no good, but they do have.

652
00:41:16,547 --> 00:41:16,990
Rym: there's this thing.

653
00:41:17,191 --> 00:41:32,504
Rym: There's this cart that comes out every day at like 2 30 and it's there until the end of the day And it's snack mix like the kind of snack mix I keep talking about like Chex Mix doodads type stuff and I've been eating that again cuz I still like that kind of food.

654
00:41:32,745 --> 00:41:38,269
Scott: the other snack the other snacks I still eat is like a fruit like I'll go to the Apple House buy a bunch of apples and eat one apple every day.

655
00:41:39,301 --> 00:41:43,240
Scott: or You know, I got like a bag of nuts.

656
00:41:43,642 --> 00:41:53,349
Rym: right I'll get like a bag of nuts, you know I don't eat fruit as snacks anymore But I eat fruit as a meal cuz I'll eat like a banana and like an orange as breakfast.

657
00:41:55,072 --> 00:41:56,330
Scott: Banana alone is not breakfast.

658
00:41:56,411 --> 00:41:58,750
Scott: I got to cut up that banana and put it in a Rice Krispie to make it break.

659
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:04,962
Rym: So for most of my life, I just either didn't eat breakfast or I'd like especially in college Like I pretty much would eat a I a tree.

660
00:42:05,042 --> 00:42:06,230
Scott: This is the most best food.

661
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:12,250
Rym: No I treated lunch like dinner and I'd eat a giant lunch and a small dinner and I'd skip breakfast for a long time.

662
00:42:12,954 --> 00:42:15,310
Rym: I only started eating breakfast again very recently.

663
00:42:15,751 --> 00:42:24,057
Scott: other snacks I eat are like these days is like I'll get a bowl put some salsa in it and get the chips and Just eat until I want to stop.

664
00:42:24,137 --> 00:42:27,810
Scott: but my pro technique is I put sour cream in that bowl of salsa.

665
00:42:28,478 --> 00:42:29,208
Scott: That's my pro technique.

666
00:42:30,411 --> 00:42:30,994
Rym: That's pretty good.

667
00:42:31,014 --> 00:42:31,918
Rym: So nowadays.

668
00:42:31,939 --> 00:42:37,699
Rym: Yeah, when I want to usually when I snack it's either I'm desperately hungry between GeekNights and eating dinner.

669
00:42:38,241 --> 00:42:41,754
Rym: So I'll go eat like a handful of peanuts or something Like.

670
00:42:41,774 --> 00:42:43,965
Rym: I'll just go open the kid like whatever crackers are open.

671
00:42:43,985 --> 00:42:44,789
Rym: I'll just eat some of them.

672
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:49,730
Rym: but when I actually snack now, there's the only kind of snacks I have that aren't like a random banana are?

673
00:42:50,971 --> 00:43:00,887
Rym: I'll get out like a small collection of cheeses and meats and cut like a small Charcuterie kind of plate and I'll eat that like some olives and some cheese and some crackers like.

674
00:43:00,987 --> 00:43:04,629
Rym: I'll prepare it Like it's a meal and then I'll eat it from a little plate.

675
00:43:05,592 --> 00:43:09,816
Scott: Yeah, I mean the thing is like, you know, I don't eat like Prepackaged snacks anymore.

676
00:43:09,836 --> 00:43:18,736
Scott: Yeah, there are times when like some snacks would get into my house I would buy them or whatever and then if I had a like a box of snack It sort of fell into two categories.

677
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:19,740
Scott: right category one.

678
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,987
Scott: I forgot about it and didn't eat it like.

679
00:43:22,048 --> 00:43:24,996
Rym: oh no What's this bag of tidbits?

680
00:43:25,156 --> 00:43:26,200
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

681
00:43:26,481 --> 00:43:27,846
Scott: how did what's this in my cabinet?

682
00:43:27,906 --> 00:43:28,308
Scott: Oh my god.

683
00:43:28,348 --> 00:43:28,930
Scott: How old is this?

684
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:36,989
Scott: Or the category of like I would buy a bag of golden Oreo and every day I would eat two or three golden Oreo.

685
00:43:37,653 --> 00:43:39,990
Scott: Usually is dessert though, but something sugary like that.

686
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:44,710
Scott: But you know just like once a day eat one serving of the thing until it's gone.

687
00:43:44,951 --> 00:43:55,295
Rym: I guess what's interesting is that most of the sweet snacks that I ate through high school and Into college until I stopped and that I don't eat now Basically just garbage.

688
00:43:55,516 --> 00:44:05,070
Rym: Yep, like the good like their garbage to the point that I feel vaguely sick like zebra cakes Disgusting and yet I would eat two to five of them a day in high school.

689
00:44:05,614 --> 00:44:06,986
Scott: I mean that's really been the.

690
00:44:07,248 --> 00:44:09,376
Scott: you know The key is like I don't.

691
00:44:09,697 --> 00:44:10,259
Scott: I just don't.

692
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:13,450
Scott: I eat the meals of the day and I don't eat a lot of other food.

693
00:44:13,812 --> 00:44:17,910
Scott: I haven't even bought fire yogurt and like many many moons mostly cuz it hasn't been on sale.

694
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:18,874
Scott: They buy it was on sale.

695
00:44:19,295 --> 00:44:28,065
Rym: So I think part of that is that while I am still hyperactive like you bike a lot I ain't run all the time, but I'm not also growing like I was in high school

696
00:44:28,325 --> 00:44:28,787
Scott: obviously,

697
00:44:29,268 --> 00:44:40,368
Rym: but to a Lot of the garbage I ate was sort of like the cheap garbage and now that I have some money I just pretty much always eat really high quality food.

698
00:44:40,389 --> 00:44:44,702
Rym: and Once that happened, I find it very difficult to eat.

699
00:44:44,943 --> 00:44:48,630
Rym: like when I say the high quality versus low quality I don't mean like cheap food is not bad.

700
00:44:48,691 --> 00:44:59,610
Rym: There's really good cheap food but like Like the food you would buy in the grocery store For like kids to snack on like zebra cakes and things like that are just so disgusting to me that I cannot eat them anymore.

701
00:44:59,871 --> 00:45:07,341
Scott: It's like I just you know by if I have a food in the house in the apartment and it's noticeable It's not hiding somewhere like the back of the fridge and I see it.

702
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:09,270
Scott: then I'll eat the one serving a day.

703
00:45:09,692 --> 00:45:12,430
Scott: So I just don't put that kind of food in the house, right?

704
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:12,691
Scott: And it's.

705
00:45:12,711 --> 00:45:16,010
Scott: but you know, it helps a lot is actually the blue apron like food delivery?

706
00:45:16,231 --> 00:45:20,025
Scott: Yeah, it's like if you don't go to the grocery store, you don't see those things.

707
00:45:20,266 --> 00:45:21,793
Scott: So you don't buy them So you don't need them.

708
00:45:21,813 --> 00:45:27,970
Rym: when I go grocery shopping It's not wander around the grocery store and grab all the shit I want.

709
00:45:28,151 --> 00:45:30,785
Rym: It's what do I need to cook the meals for the next few weeks?

710
00:45:30,846 --> 00:45:31,449
Rym: All right, I need.

711
00:45:31,469 --> 00:45:34,480
Scott: yeah I have a recipe and I get the ingredients for that recipe.

712
00:45:34,781 --> 00:45:37,330
Scott: I don't buy anything else in the grocery store.

713
00:45:37,371 --> 00:45:38,710
Rym: Yeah, I don't browse fresh right?

714
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:44,137
Rym: I literally type like white onion because I need white onions and then I click buy then I type Dandelion.

715
00:45:44,157 --> 00:45:46,333
Scott: so these things aren't in my house They're not there.

716
00:45:46,413 --> 00:45:49,246
Scott: so I don't eat them even though I might and I might want to.

717
00:45:49,266 --> 00:45:52,543
Rym: it doesn't happen And that might be part of why we're not.

718
00:45:52,563 --> 00:45:53,749
Scott: that I don't know.

719
00:45:53,951 --> 00:45:56,203
Scott: But I've never been fat even when I was eating those new.

720
00:45:56,284 --> 00:45:57,330
Scott: even I was eating many ring things.

721
00:45:57,611 --> 00:45:58,514
Scott: That is one thing.

722
00:45:58,595 --> 00:46:07,050
Rym: cuz you ate that crap when you weren't that active like before you started biking a lot But I ate that crap and I was crazy active and neither like we didn't either one of us really gained.

723
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:08,763
Scott: Anyway, DNA matters a lot.

724
00:46:08,944 --> 00:46:20,153
Rym: Yeah but Most the list of snacks that I ate as a kid That I find disgusting today is so expensive like Doritos Cheez-its.

725
00:46:20,474 --> 00:46:22,923
Rym: Well, I used to eat Cheetos.

726
00:46:23,325 --> 00:46:23,526
Scott: Yes.

727
00:46:23,546 --> 00:46:24,590
Scott: Yeah, I don't I never eat.

728
00:46:25,413 --> 00:46:30,150
Rym: Pour like a quarter of a bag of Cheetos into a bowl and eat them all while I play video games.

729
00:46:30,531 --> 00:46:31,334
Scott: See my whole life.

730
00:46:31,454 --> 00:46:35,389
Scott: I never ate anything with what I call flavor powder, right?

731
00:46:35,409 --> 00:46:35,710
Rym: I did.

732
00:46:36,092 --> 00:46:40,270
Rym: I love the shit out of Oreos in middle school Oreos Doritos in middle school, right?

733
00:46:40,451 --> 00:46:46,670
Scott: So for example, like when I was talking about getting a corn chip with salsa I get a corn chip that has nothing on it, but corn and salt pretty much.

734
00:46:46,911 --> 00:46:51,945
Scott: Yeah, if you go to the potato chip aisle, it's like I'll get regular potato chip.

735
00:46:52,206 --> 00:46:53,670
Scott: I'll get roughly potato chip.

736
00:46:54,071 --> 00:46:56,520
Scott: I'll get a darker russet potato chip.

737
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:58,186
Scott: It's made with a or kettle chip.

738
00:46:58,306 --> 00:46:59,210
Scott: Those are all just fine.

739
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:02,884
Rym: I'll go one step further and sometimes I'll get like vinegar and sea salt.

740
00:47:02,964 --> 00:47:03,667
Rym: No, that's okay.

741
00:47:03,707 --> 00:47:04,590
Scott: No, we'll not do that.

742
00:47:04,691 --> 00:47:06,339
Scott: No, I don't do any.

743
00:47:06,399 --> 00:47:14,327
Scott: as soon as it's like barbecue chip or The chips that have powder on them are disgusting right but this that's the.

744
00:47:14,427 --> 00:47:15,089
Scott: I don't get Vin.

745
00:47:15,129 --> 00:47:17,259
Scott: Nope I don't get any but flavored but not.

746
00:47:17,521 --> 00:47:19,430
Rym: it's not like it's synthetic vinegar.

747
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:26,910
Scott: All Doritos are like these basically tasteless chips that are covered in like this powder of flavor and it's like.

748
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:27,333
Scott: no I don't eat.

749
00:47:27,373 --> 00:47:28,601
Scott: I don't cheese balls.

750
00:47:28,682 --> 00:47:28,883
Scott: Nope.

751
00:47:28,924 --> 00:47:32,945
Scott: Don't eat cheese balls Combos those pretzels with the poison in the middle.

752
00:47:32,965 --> 00:47:37,502
Rym: So when I was So I would eat like I had the snacks I would eat.

753
00:47:37,843 --> 00:47:41,844
Scott: but most of the memory in those my whole life They're that I knew in middle school.

754
00:47:41,884 --> 00:47:46,990
Rym: in high school Like everyone else like one they get lunch from the school cafeteria, which I never did cuz that shit was disgusting.

755
00:47:47,338 --> 00:47:53,190
Scott: I would only Occasionally buy just a french fry in the school cafeteria if I had some money because they actually made a good fry.

756
00:47:53,331 --> 00:47:57,130
Rym: Like I got the burger for my high school once and I can't imagine eating that as a human be.

757
00:47:57,291 --> 00:48:02,439
Scott: Oh, no, I never ate the burger from the high school is disgusting but Everyone in my middle school in high school.

758
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:06,789
Rym: They eat like combos and the slush puppies.

759
00:48:08,177 --> 00:48:15,461
Rym: yeah, and That shit always looked disgusting and felt disgusting and I remember the one time I put like a combo in my mouth and it Disgusting.

760
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:20,490
Scott: no Whenever I brought my lunch, mostly my mom would make a lunch and put it in a baggie.

761
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:37,470
Rym: Oh, there was a definite turning point in my life when my mom was like you can make your own lunch and for about four years I packed a Bag of garbage every day took it to school ate it all before first period And then went out to Arby's and bought lunch.

762
00:48:37,731 --> 00:48:49,733
Scott: I had to usually one or two sandwiches peanut butter and jelly or salami or whatever and then some snack action in there right and then at lunch I would open it and eat all of it and then I'd only get like a french fry if I Was still hungry.

763
00:48:49,773 --> 00:48:51,620
Scott: and then actually in high school.

764
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:52,765
Scott: There was a there was a period.

765
00:48:53,026 --> 00:48:55,277
Scott: they had this little candy store That would open during lunch.

766
00:48:55,538 --> 00:48:56,343
Rym: Oh, we had one of those.

767
00:48:56,464 --> 00:48:57,209
Rym: the students ran it.

768
00:48:57,751 --> 00:49:04,830
Scott: Yeah, pretty much sort of I would go in there and I would buy something that was new at the time Which is mini M&Ms.

769
00:49:04,891 --> 00:49:14,066
Scott: It was this plastic tube Full of tiny tiny M&Ms and you'd open up the tube and just dump the whole tube of M&Ms in your mouth All at once like a shot.

770
00:49:14,389 --> 00:49:18,749
Scott: I Collected every single one of those tubes at a plastic bag full of tubes.

771
00:49:19,693 --> 00:49:25,410
Scott: I don't know if I still have it somewhere if I got thrown out But I had those tubes from all those mini M&Ms I ate.

772
00:49:28,291 --> 00:49:32,950
Rym: But yeah, I guess I don't know if it's just that our lifestyle changed or that we have money.

773
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:40,965
Rym: But when I snack nowadays, I pretty much like I said, I only make like I cry making a snack for myself I treat it the same way as cooking a meal.

774
00:49:40,986 --> 00:49:44,481
Scott: Mm-hmm If you're I'm just gonna say I'm not a doctor.

775
00:49:44,521 --> 00:49:45,404
Scott: do not take Scott's.

776
00:49:45,485 --> 00:49:46,950
Scott: non doctor non science.

777
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:49,057
Scott: They say don't snack non science.

778
00:49:49,097 --> 00:49:53,570
Rym: diet advice because I've read science stuff that says if you just don't snack You are better off.

779
00:49:54,092 --> 00:50:04,085
Scott: If you are someone who's doing some weird fad diet nonsense, or you're thinking about it or whatever Try doing the diet of Scott, which is a eat when you're hungry.

780
00:50:04,165 --> 00:50:06,914
Scott: B. Don't eat when you're not hungry All the time.

781
00:50:06,934 --> 00:50:12,170
Rym: I mean you're just gonna have to suffer and I'm gonna admit I am literally hungry all the time.

782
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:12,994
Scott: I'm hungry right now.

783
00:50:13,015 --> 00:50:15,890
Scott: I'm hungry right now, but I'm gonna go home and reheat my food and eat it.

784
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:19,082
Scott: But yeah, just don't eat a snack or a dessert.

785
00:50:19,223 --> 00:50:21,110
Scott: only eat the three meals a day and that's it.

786
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:24,099
Scott: They could be big meals, but just don't eat anything else.

787
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:26,426
Rym: Well, don't eat bags of garbage.

788
00:50:26,526 --> 00:50:27,730
Rym: Yeah, don't eat feed bags.

789
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:30,229
Scott: Don't need to don't eat too many ring things every day.

790
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:35,255
Rym: But at the same time if doodads if I found a box of doodads that was somehow not expired I would probably eat them.

791
00:50:35,819 --> 00:50:35,980
Scott: Mm-hmm.

792
00:50:36,483 --> 00:50:39,920
Scott: But at the same time I I used to eat Nilla wafers.

793
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:40,363
Scott: Those are good.

794
00:50:40,645 --> 00:50:41,310
Rym: Those are okay.

795
00:50:41,554 --> 00:50:42,268
Scott: I like Nilla wafer.

796
00:50:43,074 --> 00:50:46,350
Scott: The way to eat Nilla wafer is I put it in my mouth and suck on it a little bit.

797
00:50:46,450 --> 00:50:50,984
Scott: I would suck on it a whole bunch to drain it of all sugar and then eat it.

798
00:50:51,365 --> 00:50:54,695
Rym: I would do that with the Precursor to Cheez-Its.

799
00:50:55,497 --> 00:50:59,430
Scott: It's weird that like these foods have a particular way you to eat them.

800
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:06,227
Rym: That's why I fell down the fucking stairs Broke my neck because I was working out the way to particularly eat the combination of different.

801
00:51:06,247 --> 00:51:08,515
Scott: the way I eat the fire Yogurt is like I don't.

802
00:51:08,856 --> 00:51:12,090
Scott: some people I guess flip over the fruit and squeeze it onto the right.

803
00:51:13,192 --> 00:51:13,935
Scott: No, I do is?

804
00:51:13,995 --> 00:51:21,805
Scott: I take I spoon some yogurt and then I spoon a tiny amount of fruit and I try to get Fruit into every single spoon and measure it exactly right.

805
00:51:21,865 --> 00:51:22,106
Rym: Yep.

806
00:51:22,708 --> 00:51:28,069
Scott: Yeah With the fruit on the bottom yogurt, I would just stir it up real good.

807
00:51:28,331 --> 00:51:38,696
Rym: When I make myself like a little charcuterie plate of some kind I will literally like pick a particular cracker and take like the piece of salami and one of the pimento olives and then I'll eat all of those together.

808
00:51:38,716 --> 00:51:43,938
Rym: and I like craft every one of the like Things that I put into my mouth one by one.

809
00:51:44,019 --> 00:51:48,314
Scott: if I spread the cheese onto the cracker with the red stick each cracker needs The perfect coating.

810
00:51:48,374 --> 00:51:48,595
Scott: Yep.

811
00:51:48,695 --> 00:51:54,530
Scott: No, I would put and then all the left all the leftover cheese I scoop with the red stick and put directly in my mouth.

812
00:51:54,691 --> 00:51:57,629
Scott: So I scooped out with my tongue and so there is until there is none left.

813
00:51:57,891 --> 00:51:59,950
Rym: I would throw the red stick away after I had spread the cheese.

814
00:52:00,071 --> 00:52:01,769
Rym: I would just lick the inside of that thing out.

815
00:52:02,312 --> 00:52:03,799
Scott: I would I do if I spread some.

816
00:52:03,859 --> 00:52:11,370
Scott: if I use a knife to like make a peanut butter the jelly sandwich I spread the peanut butter then I lick the knife clean then I spread the jelly then I lick the knife clean.

817
00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:12,803
Scott: You might say oh my god, you licked a knife.

818
00:52:12,823 --> 00:52:13,550
Scott: They went in the jelly.

819
00:52:13,811 --> 00:52:15,415
Scott: Yeah, but I'm the only one eating that jelly.

820
00:52:15,455 --> 00:52:15,977
Scott: So whatever.

821
00:52:16,819 --> 00:52:17,842
Scott: No one else is eating my jelly.

822
00:52:18,704 --> 00:52:22,615
Rym: I would not do that Even if I was the only one.

823
00:52:22,675 --> 00:52:29,660
Scott: if I am sharing the peanut butter and jelly with other people I get my own plastic disposable knife to lick and don't use the knife everyone else is using.

824
00:52:30,483 --> 00:52:32,690
Scott: so I am respectful of other people's.

825
00:52:33,395 --> 00:52:36,014
Scott: You know not getting my spit in their jelly So interesting.

826
00:52:36,034 --> 00:52:38,126
Rym: when I think about it, I don't consider cook, but I like to like.

827
00:52:38,166 --> 00:52:38,930
Scott: I like to lick the knife.

828
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:42,267
Rym: But I eat cookies like all the time cookies or snacks, but unless after dinner.

829
00:52:42,307 --> 00:52:42,790
Scott: that is dessert.

830
00:52:42,991 --> 00:52:44,743
Rym: Yeah, but I just eat cookies all the time.

831
00:52:44,803 --> 00:52:45,770
Rym: Like if there's cookies I eat them.

832
00:52:45,850 --> 00:52:48,550
Scott: Well, yeah, but the thing is if there's cookies I feel food aggressive.

833
00:52:48,610 --> 00:52:51,610
Scott: But the only time there are cookies is packs.

834
00:52:52,832 --> 00:52:56,470
Scott: If I buy a bag of cookies, which I haven't done in forever or if I bake cookies, right?

835
00:52:56,610 --> 00:52:58,155
Scott: There aren't cookies around that often.

836
00:52:58,196 --> 00:53:02,170
Scott: So when they are around I'll eat one or two or three or four.

837
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:02,692
Rym: Well, you know what?

838
00:53:02,732 --> 00:53:08,890
Scott: The difference is when I heard snack period when I eat a bunch of cookies like the most cookies I'll eat like let's say there's a bucket of cookies.

839
00:53:09,312 --> 00:53:18,540
Scott: I'll eat one time between lunch and dinner three or four cookies And then if I am hungry after dinner for dessert three or four cookies And that is the most cookie.

840
00:53:18,641 --> 00:53:19,690
Scott: I will eat this maximum.

841
00:53:19,791 --> 00:53:28,810
Rym: But that is why like I eat a lot of cookies Compared to the amount of cookies I buy but I basically only buy or make like nice fancy cookies.

842
00:53:29,332 --> 00:53:30,678
Rym: I basically don't eat things like I don't know.

843
00:53:30,758 --> 00:53:33,329
Scott: you don't buy the goods every time I kind of mix it up.

844
00:53:33,611 --> 00:53:36,710
Rym: Those shortbread cookies for fresh direct are real real goddamn good.

845
00:53:37,432 --> 00:53:44,110
Rym: And as I've gotten older, I've come to particularly appreciate the simple the humble sugar cookie and the simple shortbread cookie.

846
00:53:44,171 --> 00:53:45,649
Rym: Those might be my favorite kinds of cookies.

847
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:54,811
Rym: But when I think of snack, I pretty much always think of savory things vaguely in the realm of pretzels peanuts Chex mix type stuff Mm-hmm.

848
00:53:55,333 --> 00:54:04,105
Scott: There is the magic mix which when I if I have a whole but usually I'll make the magic mix because I need it For some you know thing to take it somewhere like biking or whatever, but I treat that.

849
00:54:04,165 --> 00:54:05,390
Rym: I treat that like fuel.

850
00:54:05,451 --> 00:54:06,550
Rym: I don't think of it as a snack.

851
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:10,369
Rym: I think of it as I am on a long run and I need to eat something halfway through it.

852
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:15,410
Scott: But if I happen to have a I make them the magic mix in a like a gallon ziplock bag.

853
00:54:15,530 --> 00:54:24,670
Scott: Yeah, so there's a ton of it when I make it and if I have it in the fridge and I'm hungry between meals I'll go in there take the whole bag out and just eat a few fistfuls of it till I don't want anymore.

854
00:54:24,972 --> 00:54:31,063
Rym: So I realized the thing I was talking about where as a kid I would be very weirdly particular about how I combine my snacks.

855
00:54:31,565 --> 00:54:37,554
Rym: I realized I do still do that because When I went when I do the like standing in the kitchen I needed II.

856
00:54:37,714 --> 00:54:40,390
Rym: I need to eat a handful of something because it's gonna take me a while to cook dinner.

857
00:54:41,432 --> 00:54:47,824
Rym: my go-to is to eat like Some croutons and then some peanuts and stop eating the croutons.

858
00:54:47,844 --> 00:54:49,189
Scott: So croutons are for salad only.

859
00:54:49,209 --> 00:54:50,953
Rym: I Actually will put.

860
00:54:51,033 --> 00:54:56,730
Rym: I'll bite into the croutons first and then I'll put some peanuts in my mouth and then I'll chew them up together.

861
00:54:56,974 --> 00:54:57,443
Scott: What the hell?

862
00:54:59,133 --> 00:55:01,603
Rym: That is a better experience than the croutons.

863
00:55:01,664 --> 00:55:03,110
Scott: peanut and crouton do not go together.

864
00:55:03,912 --> 00:55:10,229
Rym: I think if pop culture had put croutons in checks mix tile style snack mixes you would have no problem with this.

865
00:55:10,693 --> 00:55:12,270
Scott: No, I would have a huge problem with that.

866
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:13,493
Rym: But do you have a problem with snack mixes?

867
00:55:13,534 --> 00:55:24,839
Rym: the ones that are like peanut checks pretzel stick cheese thing maybe a raisin cheese cheese stick Like a tidbit What you don't remember.

868
00:55:24,879 --> 00:55:26,128
Rym: what's in like checks mix do ya?

869
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:29,037
Rym: This checks like this kind of raisin.

870
00:55:29,057 --> 00:55:30,702
Scott: I know you hate raisin.

871
00:55:30,722 --> 00:55:32,267
Rym: I do not hate raisin.

872
00:55:32,307 --> 00:55:33,070
Scott: I thought you hated raisin.

873
00:55:33,171 --> 00:55:34,097
Rym: I like raisins fine.

874
00:55:34,198 --> 00:55:35,790
Scott: Pretty sure you change your mind on raisin.

875
00:55:36,352 --> 00:55:41,590
Rym: I'm not a fan of eating a fistful of raisins by themselves, but I like raisins like in certain other things.

876
00:55:41,891 --> 00:55:43,499
Rym: Mm-hmm golden raisins in.

877
00:55:43,539 --> 00:55:44,102
Scott: that reminds me.

878
00:55:44,122 --> 00:55:45,006
