1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,759
Rym: It's Wednesday, May 3rd, 2017.

2
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:12,982
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,203 --> 00:00:15,589
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:17,980
Rym: tonight We got a double feature.

5
00:00:18,362 --> 00:00:24,208
Rym: We're talking about two comics dissolving classroom and wrecked hearts.

6
00:00:25,853 --> 00:00:26,887
Rym: Let's do this.

7
00:00:28,172 --> 00:00:29,198
Rym: So speaking of wrecked hearts.

8
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:37,517
Rym: I was looking pretty tough for the Rangers It's still tough before last night out of out of four games true But we lost the first.

9
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:44,746
Scott: imagine if we play four games of anything Yeah, and you have to win three of them, and if you don't win three you actually lose.

10
00:00:44,906 --> 00:00:51,079
Scott: even so if I just win two Then that's it, but you have to win three.

11
00:00:51,099 --> 00:00:53,890
Scott: yeah, that's not good for you and no matter what game.

12
00:00:54,051 --> 00:00:55,160
Rym: I want to be fair.

13
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,233
Scott: even if we're playing coin toss It's not good for you.

14
00:00:57,313 --> 00:01:02,070
Rym: game one against the Senators for the Rangers was pretty close and the Rangers doing okay like they just lost.

15
00:01:02,612 --> 00:01:08,130
Rym: And then game two was like crazy scoring double overtime bullshit, and it was a real close game.

16
00:01:09,056 --> 00:01:24,050
Rym: The game last night was a blowout Yeah in the other direction like It was like I'm watching the game and like they scored and then I walked away to pee and I come back and I see What I assume is a replay of the score, and then I realized that no they just scored again

17
00:01:24,691 --> 00:01:24,872
Scott: Mm-hmm.

18
00:01:25,374 --> 00:01:27,683
Rym: so uh now Scott got me to.

19
00:01:27,703 --> 00:01:34,810
Rym: Scott and I are going to the game tomorrow and Before last night I was kind of assuming that this is gonna be the last hockey game of the season for us.

20
00:01:35,312 --> 00:01:46,278
Rym: Well now mathematically cannot be the last time you know this season, but I went from Expecting to go and see the end of the Rangers run to Not expecting to go and see them win.

21
00:01:46,338 --> 00:01:52,900
Rym: because I've learned from the master Scott as a New York fan If you're winning a game by three you could still fuck it up.

22
00:01:53,181 --> 00:02:06,416
Rym: if you're winning by four you're probably gonna win By five in hockey Before it counts and you can say yeah, this game is over and turn it off because if you turn that game off It's gonna be a big comeback.

23
00:02:06,777 --> 00:02:08,162
Scott: even if you turn it off with ten points.

24
00:02:08,222 --> 00:02:09,085
Scott: It's still well uh.

25
00:02:09,487 --> 00:02:15,590
Rym: so uh What was what was the deal with that game with the Mets that I literally until yesterday assumed was a joke?

26
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,870
Scott: Oh the pitcher got injured pretty early, and then they don't have another pitcher.

27
00:02:20,072 --> 00:02:21,826
Scott: No, they do, but you know but is he bad?

28
00:02:21,906 --> 00:02:22,350
Rym: like how bad?

29
00:02:22,852 --> 00:02:24,943
Scott: They put a lot of pitchers in baseball these days.

30
00:02:24,983 --> 00:02:26,250
Scott: you change pitchers like a whole bunch.

31
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,903
Scott: Oh, yeah, usually I mean a minimum.

32
00:02:28,923 --> 00:02:30,210
Scott: you're using like three a game.

33
00:02:31,052 --> 00:02:35,627
Scott: You know four or more sounds right, but they used a lot of and they just got their asses kicked cuz.

34
00:02:35,808 --> 00:02:38,150
Rym: uh That was quite days outs.

35
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:42,886
Rym: They scored more in that game than RIT scored against Newman in that famous hockey game by one.

36
00:02:43,047 --> 00:02:45,896
Scott: see it's all like when you have A close game in any sport right.

37
00:02:46,377 --> 00:02:52,210
Scott: it's always sad when you like you lose by one because it's like ah I got a loss Even though I played really well.

38
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:56,510
Rym: But then like when you push into three overtimes in a hockey game like you feel like you should have won.

39
00:02:56,771 --> 00:02:58,661
Scott: And but if you lose by 100, it's like well.

40
00:02:58,721 --> 00:03:01,853
Scott: That's the same thing as losing by one, so it's like It's like all right.

41
00:03:01,893 --> 00:03:02,215
Scott: Whatever.

42
00:03:02,235 --> 00:03:03,320
Scott: We're gonna lose anyway.

43
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:03,903
Scott: who gives a shit.

44
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:07,097
Rym: Yeah, let's arrest the good people Which doesn't matter is my guess for pitchers.

45
00:03:07,117 --> 00:03:08,563
Rym: that matters in basketball.

46
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,290
Scott: They rest the good people, and it's a big problem.

47
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:13,345
Rym: Oh, yeah Because people only pay to see basketball to see the good.

48
00:03:13,385 --> 00:03:18,050
Scott: in the regular season Basketball is a big controversy is going on because the games they rest the good people.

49
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:21,750
Scott: But you paid to see the good people and now you paid all this money to see bench people.

50
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:29,846
Scott: Yeah, I guess you're gonna watch him on the bench anyway They might not even show up if they're traveling they don't come to your town, so I stay home.

51
00:03:30,247 --> 00:03:40,254
Rym: it is it's Wednesday So there's a bunch of anime news and anime adjacent news But the one that you all out there might have noticed if you're dirty pirates Which I assume a lot of you are.

52
00:03:40,314 --> 00:03:43,144
Rym: yeah, is that an anime torrent site called?

53
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:56,541
Rym: Yeah went down and That wouldn't really be news except that torrent site seems to have been the one that was the to use a Wall Street term the Liquidity provider for all the rest of the anime torrent.

54
00:03:56,602 --> 00:03:59,210
Scott: it was the backbone of many anime torrent sites.

55
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:09,010
Rym: Yeah, a liquidity provider is basically someone who is willing to publicly say hey I'll trade the stock like they will put liquidity into the market even but it's on other venues.

56
00:04:09,552 --> 00:04:14,712
Rym: So this was like this is where the torrents that people actually downloaded Originated.

57
00:04:15,153 --> 00:04:20,115
Rym: so all these other torrent sites that people thought oh, there's a ton of anime torrent sites There weren't?

58
00:04:20,154 --> 00:04:22,690
Rym: really there was one and a bunch of people leeching off of those.

59
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:36,988
Scott: There's more but some of them have been private and so you know yeah It's like torrents are still the best way to distribute pirate stuff without getting taken down like YouTube style, but they are Increasingly retreating to the realm of nerdy people who know the deal.

60
00:04:37,008 --> 00:04:41,250
Scott: no yeah Well it's really people always like oh my god torrents so hard.

61
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,474
Scott: Oh, they're not it's.

62
00:04:42,494 --> 00:04:46,849
Scott: you click a link you install a program wait on it so already set up that exe.

63
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:47,110
Rym: so wait.

64
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:52,150
Rym: I'm confident that if I just type torrent software the first exe I get is gonna be some malware.

65
00:04:52,231 --> 00:04:56,074
Scott: I think it'll probably be the official you Software.

66
00:04:56,114 --> 00:04:58,910
Scott: you turn oh wow yeah, all right, which is micro towards.

67
00:05:00,012 --> 00:05:01,178
Scott: Now micro you torrent.

68
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:09,306
Rym: I just people who call it you torrent are The people who type us for microseconds instead of actually typing the mu symbol.

69
00:05:09,346 --> 00:05:10,450
Scott: Yeah, can you type a new symbol?

70
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:11,839
Scott: Yes, type it right now.

71
00:05:11,859 --> 00:05:15,557
Rym: I copy pasted Watch.

72
00:05:15,598 --> 00:05:16,425
Rym: how I type it watch.

73
00:05:16,526 --> 00:05:16,970
Rym: I type watch.

74
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:19,489
Rym: Okay, what's going on here?

75
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:20,774
Scott: How do you think I?

76
00:05:20,815 --> 00:05:24,290
Scott: how do you get to the Wikipedia page for it without typing it by typing?

77
00:05:25,351 --> 00:05:26,014
Rym: Micro wouldn't?

78
00:05:26,054 --> 00:05:27,961
Scott: it is pretty slow here.

79
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:33,022
Scott: It's easier to micro Wikipedia the symbol But if you just go and type you it'll work in Google.

80
00:05:33,043 --> 00:05:34,409
Scott: you don't need to type the micro.

81
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:35,172
Rym: yeah But I need.

82
00:05:35,212 --> 00:05:37,763
Rym: I want to type the micro when I am typing the word.

83
00:05:37,823 --> 00:05:38,526
Scott: I'll learn the show.

84
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:39,530
Scott: so what's the alt code?

85
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:40,052
Scott: It's right there.

86
00:05:40,092 --> 00:05:41,319
Rym: What is like if I can't type it?

87
00:05:41,359 --> 00:05:43,772
Scott: that often anyway the point is use You're just.

88
00:05:44,234 --> 00:05:47,049
Scott: the point is I see someone not you install this program.

89
00:05:48,611 --> 00:05:49,594
Scott: You torrent is.

90
00:05:49,674 --> 00:05:53,546
Scott: it is micro torrent is legit even though it has ads in it.

91
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:54,127
Scott: It's you know.

92
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,030
Scott: It's not malware.

93
00:05:55,190 --> 00:06:01,950
Scott: It's not sure that when you run the setup that exe you uncheck all the evil boxes someone in the chat.

94
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,869
Rym: It's just like typing it over and over again.

95
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,957
Scott: Yeah, the other thing is that you can.

96
00:06:05,977 --> 00:06:09,850
Scott: there are other torrent clients that are really even less evil like transmission and such.

97
00:06:09,931 --> 00:06:17,710
Scott: Yeah, but anyway you install a program Then you go to a website you click a link the file downloads you double click on the file it plays.

98
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:21,288
Scott: It'll play in Windows Media Player, but if for some reason it doesn't it'll play in VLC.

99
00:06:22,151 --> 00:06:24,559
Scott: Perfectly there is some crazy nut jobs.

100
00:06:24,579 --> 00:06:24,900
Scott: You're like.

101
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,075
Scott: Oh you got to install this CCCP when do not install Bad news.

102
00:06:30,095 --> 00:06:35,270
Scott: because basically way back in the day way back there VLC didn't play all the files.

103
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:41,227
Rym: But generally the files VLC didn't play were the ones that came from the shadiest of the sites.

104
00:06:41,328 --> 00:06:46,208
Scott: right nowadays VLC plays absolutely everything and his toe is even super legit.

105
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:50,210
Scott: yeah And there's no reason it was all some shady Windows Media Player piece of garbage.

106
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,848
Rym: Also most of this stuff just plays in Windows Media Player.

107
00:06:52,888 --> 00:06:53,150
Rym: guys.

108
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:57,446
Scott: Yeah, regular Windows Media Player like it just works, or you know what do you have on Macs?

109
00:06:57,486 --> 00:06:58,630
Scott: quicktime something right?

110
00:06:58,810 --> 00:06:59,225
Rym: I don't even know.

111
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,577
Scott: Point is you'll download a video file.

112
00:07:01,597 --> 00:07:02,320
Scott: You'll double-click it.

113
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,350
Scott: It's gonna fucking play on your computer, and that's it.

114
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:12,250
Scott: It's not as great as YouTube where you type in a URL and then press play that's true, but it's download a file Double-click on it

115
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:26,022
Rym: And there's a gap between like the fact that you're getting this torrent file and getting the video and all these pieces Means that you're not gonna get malware unless you're dumb right or super Unknowledgeable mm-hmm, but even then point

116
00:07:26,102 --> 00:07:31,540
Scott: is if you want to distribute pirated stuff And you want to avoid YouTube takedowns just use bit torrent.

117
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,282
Scott: stop fighting it.

118
00:07:32,643 --> 00:07:34,027
Scott: just use the old pirate Bay.

119
00:07:34,107 --> 00:07:36,233
Scott: use whatever tracker is The tracker right now.

120
00:07:36,253 --> 00:07:39,062
Rym: I change trackers even matter unless you're in the know.

121
00:07:39,182 --> 00:07:46,770
Rym: it is increasingly hard for a normal person who does not Know how to find the torrents in the first place especially when the torrent aggregators keep going down.

122
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:47,715
Scott: I just go to pirate Bay.

123
00:07:47,735 --> 00:07:48,660
Scott: It's still there still work.

124
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,610
Rym: for now part of a is having some increasing trouble.

125
00:07:50,751 --> 00:07:53,123
Scott: It's it's heavy increasing troubles for like decade plus.

126
00:07:53,224 --> 00:07:54,290
Scott: It's still there still works.

127
00:07:55,271 --> 00:08:00,498
Rym: But most kids today just go to those like Blatant pirate sites like kiss anime or all.

128
00:08:00,518 --> 00:08:06,939
Scott: because if you go to Google and type in like I want to watch Naruto or Naruto Streams those are the fucking first results.

129
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,225
Scott: Yeah, you search for some like.

130
00:08:08,285 --> 00:08:09,570
Scott: I want to read Naruto manga.

131
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:09,991
Scott: It's like.

132
00:08:10,011 --> 00:08:11,957
Scott: the first result isn't buying it on Amazon.

133
00:08:12,198 --> 00:08:14,646
Scott: the first result isn't a site that has it legit.

134
00:08:14,967 --> 00:08:16,511
Scott: the first result is some pirate site.

135
00:08:16,531 --> 00:08:18,556
Scott: that is very interesting to me.

136
00:08:18,697 --> 00:08:28,002
Rym: that the the piracy means that are more old-school in the sense of I Am pirating this thing to share with you because fuck everybody.

137
00:08:28,022 --> 00:08:30,330
Rym: I'm doing it for the freedom of media.

138
00:08:30,571 --> 00:08:32,398
Rym: That's right versus that's me.

139
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,570
Rym: and those get taken down way harder than the site that's like.

140
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:38,770
Rym: Yeah, we're just like openly making money off of other people's stuff.

141
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:42,543
Scott: We're just a website that puts manga up with next to ads acting like we're legit.

142
00:08:42,604 --> 00:08:45,637
Rym: We are a crime website Doing crime.

143
00:08:45,657 --> 00:08:47,830
Scott: there's no nobility whatsoever.

144
00:08:48,011 --> 00:08:49,838
Scott: at least there's something noble about like.

145
00:08:49,979 --> 00:08:58,927
Scott: I am going to subtitle this and share it with the world because Someone who does not speak Japanese should not be denied this anime the joy of seeing space without Yamato.

146
00:08:59,128 --> 00:09:00,010
Scott: Yes for all.

147
00:09:00,111 --> 00:09:01,549
Rym: How is this website up?

148
00:09:02,431 --> 00:09:04,529
Rym: Like how how is this happening?

149
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:16,824
Rym: but anyway, yeah, if you use Torrance to get anime like a million voices just cried out and were suddenly silenced and You'll still be able to get torrents of anime tomorrow.

150
00:09:16,864 --> 00:09:17,990
Scott: You just have to go somewhere different.

151
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:18,432
Scott: It's a look.

152
00:09:18,472 --> 00:09:20,098
Scott: figure out what the new site is guys.

153
00:09:20,298 --> 00:09:23,450
Rym: It's not hard like c-roll is not paying us or anything.

154
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:25,897
Rym: The c-roll is not expensive.

155
00:09:26,117 --> 00:09:29,908
Scott: crunchyroll is way cheap like in almost everything's on there.

156
00:09:29,948 --> 00:09:31,353
Scott: if it's not on there It's on Hulu.

157
00:09:31,413 --> 00:09:32,035
Scott: if it's not on there.

158
00:09:32,075 --> 00:09:32,918
Scott: It's on Funimation.

159
00:09:32,999 --> 00:09:42,654
Scott: when I was on Netflix when I was at alright Amazon Just pick whichever one has the show you want to watch and then once you're done watching all the shows what I do And switch to another one.

160
00:09:42,735 --> 00:09:48,672
Rym: and had no money and had internet to like I had the direct connect of pirate everything in the world Forever.

161
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:52,670
Rym: if crunchyroll existed then I think I would have just paid for it.

162
00:09:53,452 --> 00:10:01,810
Rym: It was just like the idea that you could just go to a website Pay a little bit of money and have access to like more than a couple of anime.

163
00:10:02,312 --> 00:10:03,917
Rym: It's still kind of crazy to me now.

164
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:04,921
Scott: You can get all the anime.

165
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,069
Scott: every episode of Fist of the North Star is on there.

166
00:10:08,113 --> 00:10:12,510
Scott: So for less than the cost of all the DVDs of all of us to the North Star you can watch it all.

167
00:10:12,932 --> 00:10:22,607
Rym: So in some other news, it's kind of really it's tangentially related, but on Monday We were talking about like pirate and stuff and today We're talking about pirate and stuff and like the nobility of the old world.

168
00:10:22,647 --> 00:10:24,256
Rym: so once again People met.

169
00:10:24,276 --> 00:10:25,527
Rym: someone made this cool like 2d.

170
00:10:26,171 --> 00:10:28,158
Rym: Hey, I made breath of the wild, but it's 2d.

171
00:10:28,359 --> 00:10:31,550
Rym: check this out and of course it got taken down.

172
00:10:32,092 --> 00:10:33,738
Rym: Like you can't get away with this.

173
00:10:33,778 --> 00:10:37,618
Scott: you can just stop making a website that says hey Look at me.

174
00:10:37,719 --> 00:10:38,790
Scott: My name is Scott Rubin.

175
00:10:39,091 --> 00:10:40,054
Scott: I made this thing.

176
00:10:40,074 --> 00:10:44,166
Scott: that is obviously blatant infringement of Nintendo's intellectual properties.

177
00:10:44,467 --> 00:10:45,490
Scott: come and get me Nintendo.

178
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:58,310
Scott: Yeah, no, I would put it up anonymously on bit tour and say I don't know who made this now Here, that's really awesome, and it keeps getting updated and it's totally these towards and the cryptographically sign that shit.

179
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:02,885
Rym: So at some point in the future you could prove that you're the one who made it.

180
00:11:03,126 --> 00:11:06,569
Rym: Sure, but You got to get it out there first.

181
00:11:07,471 --> 00:11:17,681
Rym: If you're if your goals are purely noble if your goal is to make money and be the kiss anime of 2d breath of the wild Well, I don't know what you're expecting there.

182
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:18,926
Rym: The world is different now.

183
00:11:19,227 --> 00:11:21,595
Rym: Yep And yet more news.

184
00:11:21,896 --> 00:11:31,189
Scott: if you want to see jubilees like jubilee movies if you don't realize they're on DVD I think all of them now, but if you want to see even in the ocean waves on DVD in America now.

185
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:35,084
Rym: Fathom events, which is that thing where they'll do like an event in movie theaters.

186
00:11:35,144 --> 00:11:37,957
Rym: Sometimes it'll be a live stream thing Sometimes it'll be like.

187
00:11:38,058 --> 00:11:40,110
Scott: I wonder how much it cost to make our own fathom event.

188
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:44,150
Rym: I was thinking about that because a lot of who would buy a ticket to our fat.

189
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:45,749
Scott: So and what cut would we get?

190
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:53,609
Rym: Podcasts that are two and a half to three tiers above us in terms of like real tears like in terms of like, you know hundreds of thousands of listeners.

191
00:11:54,710 --> 00:12:02,113
Rym: They do fathom events where they get on a stage somewhere and do the podcast and people can watch it live or semi-live Movie theaters.

192
00:12:02,214 --> 00:12:03,841
Scott: Yeah, so it's not out of the realm.

193
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,440
Rym: It probably just costs some amount of money.

194
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,589
Scott: You need real good internet in the place that has the stage.

195
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:12,902
Rym: Yeah, I pretty sure that's taken care of.

196
00:12:13,425 --> 00:12:14,149
Rym: I could look into it.

197
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:24,419
Rym: I'm sure there are dozens of people who would be interested in the Be a thousand there after this But already a thousand jay kids have a job.

198
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:31,326
Rym: G kids is the go-to way to see anime in theaters and G kids and fathom are bringing six Ghibli movies.

199
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:36,990
Rym: Totoro Laputa Kiki's spirited away howl's moving castle Nausicaa.

200
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:49,950
Rym: There's gonna be subtitled and dubbed in theaters, but pretty much only in big cities I mean in New York, like every year IFC has like every Ghibli movie in New York.

201
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:53,390
Rym: I think I've seen every major anime movie.

202
00:12:54,111 --> 00:13:00,114
Scott: Hasn't been like a month gone by that I've lived here that you haven't been able to see at least one Ghibli movie in a Theater somewhere?

203
00:13:00,134 --> 00:13:01,784
Rym: never mind every new anime movie like.

204
00:13:01,804 --> 00:13:02,930
Rym: we just see them all in theaters.

205
00:13:03,131 --> 00:13:03,754
Rym: like it's not.

206
00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:12,304
Rym: the moral of this news is live in a city or I guess Tampa like if you live like in Florida or something, that's a real city.

207
00:13:12,665 --> 00:13:13,347
Scott: It's a city.

208
00:13:13,407 --> 00:13:14,310
Scott: It's certainly not a town.

209
00:13:14,611 --> 00:13:15,354
Rym: Yeah, that is true.

210
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:17,643
Rym: But I mean technically beacon is a city.

211
00:13:17,904 --> 00:13:22,584
Scott: Yeah, well Tampa has Professional sports teams all of them.

212
00:13:22,604 --> 00:13:29,898
Rym: Oh, that's a good Nationally known professional sports team.

213
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,784
Scott: Yeah, Tampa has every sport.

214
00:13:32,106 --> 00:13:33,390
Rym: Yeah, I think that's the line.

215
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,758
Scott: I don't think it has basketball team.

216
00:13:34,838 --> 00:13:39,342
Scott: Seattle does not have every kind of sport though I think the only basketball team in Florida is their Miami Heat.

217
00:13:39,483 --> 00:13:40,207
Scott: Do they need to have any?

218
00:13:40,227 --> 00:13:40,790
Scott: that's another one.

219
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:44,050
Scott: So is the line Orlando Magic, but there's no Tampa basketball team.

220
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:48,163
Rym: Is the line just one or all of the major sports?

221
00:13:48,604 --> 00:13:50,310
Rym: cuz Seattle don't got no hockey team.

222
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,296
Scott: Yeah has to have.

223
00:13:51,357 --> 00:13:52,323
Scott: they had basketball.

224
00:13:52,344 --> 00:13:52,585
Scott: they had.

225
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:53,149
Scott: they had three.

226
00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:53,752
Scott: now They have two.

227
00:13:53,772 --> 00:13:57,046
Scott: Yeah, and I think if you have a football team in America, that's nice.

228
00:13:57,227 --> 00:13:57,990
Scott: I'd already counts.

229
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:59,094
Rym: I think you know, here's what you need.

230
00:13:59,114 --> 00:14:04,929
Rym: You need either a football team or Any two other national sports teams?

231
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:06,997
Rym: Yeah, it's one of those.

232
00:14:07,299 --> 00:14:08,547
Rym: football or pick two.

233
00:14:09,776 --> 00:14:18,298
Scott: But anyway, I think San Diego They had the Chargers and the Padres And now they lost the Chargers.

234
00:14:18,438 --> 00:14:21,369
Scott: Yeah, they only have baseball in San Diego.

235
00:14:21,409 --> 00:14:23,859
Scott: now I guess they might have soccer, but I don't think they have.

236
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:25,244
Scott: there's no hockey.

237
00:14:25,284 --> 00:14:26,710
Rym: it Vegas doesn't have hot.

238
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,523
Scott: No, it's the San Jose Sharks.

239
00:14:28,543 --> 00:14:31,214
Scott: There's no San Diego Hockey team.

240
00:14:31,294 --> 00:14:33,222
Rym: Vegas won't have hockey till next year.

241
00:14:33,744 --> 00:14:34,627
Rym: Well the end of this year.

242
00:14:34,929 --> 00:14:37,157
Scott: technically Yeah, Vegas is a major city without any.

243
00:14:37,257 --> 00:14:39,706
Rym: well is Vegas a city or is Vegas a theme park?

244
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:50,695
Rym: Oh But yeah, you can see Ghibli's in the theater and Actually with modern projection like it's all digital and like really high quality It's actually worth it.

245
00:14:50,735 --> 00:14:56,270
Rym: If you've never seen a Ghibli movie in the theater, even if you've seen them all It's worth it to see one of them in the theater.

246
00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:08,074
Scott: I also imagine most people haven't seen all of them like we've seen all of them but like we're oddities people in the United States who are among a small number of people who have seen all of these almost all of these things and honestly like Ones worth seeing.

247
00:15:08,214 --> 00:15:16,061
Rym: if you haven't seen like all the Ghibli movies in the theater and you haven't seen La Pita Castle in the sky I go see that one in the theater because

248
00:15:16,161 --> 00:15:16,763
Scott: it's the first

249
00:15:16,964 --> 00:15:25,489
Rym: one and also it is Like there's a lot going on in that movie that is enhanced by being in a theater setting just the scope of it.

250
00:15:26,297 --> 00:15:27,208
Rym: Anyway, I digress.

251
00:15:28,531 --> 00:15:29,295
Rym: Another piece of news.

252
00:15:29,576 --> 00:15:33,070
Rym: you guys know we were for a while doing that new tennis show which is coming back.

253
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:35,097
Rym: Just I got to do a bunch of crap first.

254
00:15:35,117 --> 00:15:35,639
Rym: Stay tuned.

255
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,770
Rym: I'm fighting off like three takedowns, right?

256
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:41,117
Scott: But here's some mutana that's not being taken down.

257
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:46,681
Rym: All of utana is just on YouTube legally legally Subtitled for free.

258
00:15:46,963 --> 00:15:50,964
Scott: No crunchyroll Funimation Hulu required go to you.

259
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:51,567
Rym: Only up to 480p.

260
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:59,979
Rym: But utana was only made in like 480p like the blu-rays you can see Like cell defects.

261
00:16:00,119 --> 00:16:05,996
Rym: if you watch the remastered blu-rays like you can see 16 by 9 HD show.

262
00:16:06,036 --> 00:16:08,864
Scott: the show is from 1990 something not late.

263
00:16:09,225 --> 00:16:09,406
Rym: Yeah.

264
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:11,010
Rym: It's a four by three anime.

265
00:16:11,191 --> 00:16:13,530
Scott: It was made for analog crap o TVs.

266
00:16:13,971 --> 00:16:22,408
Rym: So watching on YouTube in 480p is just fine and frankly if you're free for free Just you know, if you're a GeekNights fan, you've been a GeekNights fan for the last 12 years.

267
00:16:23,011 --> 00:16:25,623
Rym: You've probably seen utana because we talk about it a lot.

268
00:16:26,165 --> 00:16:35,279
Rym: if you've never seen Shojo Kakuma utana, it is a real important anime in terms like there's By so many things and there's not one.

269
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:41,770
Scott: it also once you see it and you're gonna go back to some other thing you saw And be like, oh, that's a new tenor reference that I miss desert.

270
00:16:42,392 --> 00:16:44,076
Rym: But also it's a bridge.

271
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:53,805
Rym: those references to utana are in a way bridges because utana is referencing Even weirder stuff like brother dear brother that I'm sure you've never seen.

272
00:16:53,825 --> 00:16:55,250
Scott: isn't brother your brother newer than antenna?

273
00:16:59,068 --> 00:17:00,735
Scott: You I'm pretty sure you 10.

274
00:17:00,735 --> 00:17:02,560
Scott: It doesn't reference brother dear brother.

275
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,563
Rym: They're very similar.

276
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:04,786
Rym: Yeah 91 other.

277
00:17:04,807 --> 00:17:10,214
Rym: I think they were contemporary Mmm, but the manga 70s the anime didn't come out till 91 92.

278
00:17:10,214 --> 00:17:14,773
Scott: I don't know Whatever the point is.

279
00:17:15,155 --> 00:17:16,297
Scott: it's for free on YouTube.

280
00:17:16,338 --> 00:17:16,858
Scott: Holy crap.

281
00:17:16,878 --> 00:17:18,407
Scott: Watch it utana.

282
00:17:19,392 --> 00:17:20,097
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

283
00:17:20,117 --> 00:17:21,467
Rym: There are things that are like it.

284
00:17:22,673 --> 00:17:29,729
Rym: But the things that are like it are also made by ikuhara Rosa Versailles kinda.

285
00:17:30,553 --> 00:17:37,820
Rym: Yeah, or well, I mean there's yurikuma which is the most recent iteration of let's have I mean Rosa Versailles right heavily.

286
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,069
Scott: It's probably the thing that influenced utana a bunch.

287
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:57,840
Rym: yeah, visually I guess you know, but I Can't think of anything that told the same story that attended the way that told it with that combination of weird music and weird allegory, you know allegory or allegory is If you haven't seen utana you literally have no excuse.

288
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,182
Rym: you can.

289
00:17:58,463 --> 00:18:03,785

Scott: Me too.

296
00:18:13,128 --> 00:18:31,380
Rym: Yeah But anyway things of the day.

297
00:18:31,763 --> 00:18:39,100
Rym: There was a toy Series like one of those lines of toys that I had as a kid that I remember being super fucking legit.

298
00:18:39,843 --> 00:18:48,720
Rym: But at the same time I also remembered he-man being super fucking legit Mm-hmm, and there was a point in my life when I learned my lesson that he-man is the opposite of legit.

299
00:18:49,164 --> 00:18:50,479
Scott: I mean, it's legitimately bad.

300
00:18:51,242 --> 00:18:53,189
Rym: Yeah, and it is the toys thing.

301
00:18:53,229 --> 00:18:55,778
Scott: is the he-man toys are actually good the show which is bad.

302
00:18:55,818 --> 00:18:57,592
Rym: They're okay They're not as good as the show is.

303
00:18:57,653 --> 00:19:08,712
Rym: hey, yeah Yeah mass toys were like way better than even the best transformers in terms of the physicality of the toy The best toy in terms of action figures ever.

304
00:19:08,752 --> 00:19:09,554
Scott: It's the technodrome.

305
00:19:09,734 --> 00:19:11,680
Scott: They're real metal Voltron.

306
00:19:12,101 --> 00:19:14,552
Rym: Yeah, if you're gonna go yeah, you wanna go real toys.

Rym: There was my grandpa's.

309
00:19:17,563 --> 00:19:19,610
Scott: it was actually a gun the shop.

310
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:30,075
Rym: It was an actually a gun, but you put these low Gunpowder cartridges in it that weren't that dangerous But it was basically actual gun actual gun.

311
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:33,649
Scott: Yeah actual weak gun But not as good as Voltron.

312
00:19:33,709 --> 00:19:38,229
Rym: so I found I stumbled upon The commercial for these toys.

313
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:39,696
Rym: the toys were spy tech.

314
00:19:39,937 --> 00:19:40,519
Scott: I never heard of it.

315
00:19:40,841 --> 00:19:51,400
Rym: So these toys were almost without an exception Garbage legit spy shit like if you wanted to actually spy on people for real.

316
00:19:52,421 --> 00:19:53,064
Rym: They were like.

00:19:54,491 --> 00:19:56,100
Rym: I'm skip they legit did it.

319
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:56,983
Rym: So, you know what they were.

320
00:19:57,003 --> 00:20:02,600

321
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,182
Rym: it Was really good.

322
00:20:03,644 --> 00:20:05,854
Rym: One of them was some walkie-talkies like back then.

323
00:20:05,894 --> 00:20:08,686
Rym: walkie-talkies were like a Walkie-talkies like $100.

324
00:20:08,686 --> 00:20:09,149
Scott: No, they were cheap.

325
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,493
Scott: Well, I had walkie-talkies, but they weren't spy tech but they were.

326
00:20:13,513 --> 00:20:19,767
Rym: but they were branded like a part of the toy set But you could hide him cuz you like warm on your belt Large and actually they worked quite well.

327
00:20:20,068 --> 00:20:23,840
Scott: and I had a Morse code chart printed on the front and I know exactly the Fisher price one.

328
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,807
Rym: I know exactly an orange button.

329
00:20:25,848 --> 00:20:28,980
Rym: You know, I had that exact walkie-talkie, but you could also talk.

330
00:20:29,863 --> 00:20:33,416

331
00:20:33,617 --> 00:20:38,746
Scott: these guys Yes, that's the one they actually Think was a little better than that one.

332
00:20:39,147 --> 00:20:39,589
Rym: Oh, really?

333
00:20:39,609 --> 00:20:41,013
Rym: Yeah, is it that one?

334
00:20:41,555 --> 00:20:42,578
Scott: No, that's an actual.

335
00:20:42,939 --> 00:20:46,688
Scott: yeah The chart on the front of mine wasn't a piece of paper.

336
00:20:46,809 --> 00:20:50,100
Scott: it was like a plastic in like raised thing.

337
00:20:50,861 --> 00:20:52,044
Rym: Was it this one?

338
00:20:52,305 --> 00:20:54,170
Rym: No, cuz that one I also had.

339
00:20:54,371 --> 00:20:59,827
Scott: it was mine regret, but it's very very similar effectively the same toy Yeah, but these were like hidden.

340
00:20:59,887 --> 00:21:03,855
Rym: like you wore the belt pack and actually worked really well and you had this tiny like transmitter in your ear.

341
00:21:05,101 --> 00:21:06,226
Rym: It had sunglasses you could wear.

342
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:08,012
Rym: that had like mirrors you could see behind you.

343
00:21:08,053 --> 00:21:10,000
Rym: that were discreet like they're actually discreet.

344
00:21:10,562 --> 00:21:12,109
Rym: It had motion detectors you could leave.

345
00:21:12,129 --> 00:21:16,626
Rym: that would like set off alarms and had signal lights and Like they weren't.

346
00:21:16,646 --> 00:21:18,919
Rym: that like super high-tech like they were pretty simple stuff.

347
00:21:19,481 --> 00:21:21,026
Rym: But I put.

348
00:21:21,066 --> 00:21:26,447
Rym: I looked into like how well they work and I found a bunch of people like reviewing them from a modern Standpoint.

349
00:21:27,314 --> 00:21:33,260
Rym: they were legit Like if you want to spy on other people's for real to find things out about them.

350
00:21:33,641 --> 00:21:45,740
Rym: These toys were way more functional than I think like parents who bought them for their kids realized And I would not be surprised if more than one kid found out where dad was going when he worked late with this shit.

351
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:54,000
Rym: Yeah, so this is one of the first commercial for spy tech and the craziest thing about this commercial seems vaguely familiar.

352
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:58,294
Rym: Yeah, you watch the commercial at commercials and you'll see they were skipping through it.

353
00:21:58,414 --> 00:21:59,337
Rym: They were a series.

354
00:21:59,858 --> 00:22:02,650
Rym: I had Every one of these fucking toys.

355
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:08,635
Rym: I had none of these toys and I used them to spy on the neighbors Like I like legit spied through neighbors windows.

356
00:22:08,655 --> 00:22:09,700
Scott: What'd you learn about the neighbors?

357
00:22:10,363 --> 00:22:13,619
Rym: Real boring stuff like nothing interesting at any point ever.

358
00:22:13,941 --> 00:22:19,000
Rym: Yeah, but the craziest part was that they came with manuals that were like how to spy on people.

359
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:23,900
Rym: I found some of the manuals and I was reading through them today when I thought about doing this new this thing of the day.

360
00:22:24,821 --> 00:22:30,055
Rym: They give legit advice on how to do dead drops and like how to tail people without getting caught.

361
00:22:30,476 --> 00:22:32,040
Rym: Mm-hmm like real advice.

362
00:22:33,461 --> 00:22:34,818
Rym: So that was a thing.

363
00:22:36,782 --> 00:22:41,079
Rym: Oh number one comment on this video, why are a bunch of kids stalking that guy commuting to work?

364
00:22:42,502 --> 00:22:44,115
Rym: Comment one because they know what's up.

365
00:22:47,101 --> 00:22:47,584
Rym: So what do you got?

366
00:22:47,624 --> 00:22:53,340
Scott: for me this is just a tweet with some pictures in it But what this is is in Turkey's doing some archaeology.

367
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:57,256
Scott: It's like as despite how our bad things are there you can still do archaeology.

368
00:22:57,296 --> 00:22:58,140
Scott: They're just fine.

369
00:22:59,573 --> 00:23:01,507
Scott: and This guy uncovered a mosaic.

370
00:23:01,567 --> 00:23:03,655
Scott: mosaics are like the best except for tapestries.

371
00:23:03,695 --> 00:23:04,840
Scott: mosaics like second best.

372
00:23:05,061 --> 00:23:08,940
Rym: Yeah, when I was in Turkey, one of the best things is seeing the old mosaics all over the city.

373
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,067
Scott: I kind of want to make mosaics.

374
00:23:10,128 --> 00:23:12,060
Scott: I feel like I can't draw but I feel like I could make a mosaic.

375
00:23:12,181 --> 00:23:13,530
Rym: It's basically just pixel art.

376
00:23:13,732 --> 00:23:14,820
Scott: Yeah, I could do that anyway.

377
00:23:16,121 --> 00:23:17,930
Scott: Only pixels can be any shape and size.

378
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:19,015
Scott: Yeah color.

379
00:23:19,377 --> 00:23:36,900
Rym: Yeah Yeah, this mosaic is a totally fucking badass skeleton from like what years Ancient time, uh, if I had to guess just look centuries ago I saw this when it got tweeted because this is basically dumb other fucking share zone, right?

380
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,988
Scott: But basically it's an awesome skeleton.

381
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:41,458
Scott: It's at least centuries old.

382
00:23:41,538 --> 00:23:45,932
Rym: if not, okay It's it's earlier than I thought I was gonna guess like 500 600 AD.

383
00:23:46,012 --> 00:23:47,196
Rym: It's actually third century.

384
00:23:47,537 --> 00:23:52,475
Scott: Yeah, that's old Millennia old and what does it say on the skeleton?

385
00:23:52,615 --> 00:23:53,840
Scott: be cool and live your life?

386
00:23:54,521 --> 00:23:56,168

Rym: You're gonna be a skeleton Or more importantly you're gonna be a skeleton someday.

390
00:24:10,581 --> 00:24:16,300
Scott: Anyway, it's basically the same exact message as the happy birthday comic with the grim reaper moving the little bead.

391
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:18,507
Scott: Yeah, the fairy ballad version.

392

397
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:46,832
Scott: Yeah, I think I'll probably go beat him right now if I wanted to but I don't.

398
00:24:47,254 --> 00:24:50,250
Rym: I'm poking around the Goron zone And I'm not finishing the Goron zone.

399
00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:51,560
Scott: I didn't even go to the Goron zone.

400
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:56,840
Scott: Yeah, I've been to every other zone But I'm cleaning up all the other zones and upgrading tons and tons of shit before I go to the Goron.

401
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:02,939
Scott: Also, I learned I imagine when I do go to the Goron zone I'm just gonna blow it out of the water like I did not know horses could die.

402
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:06,220
Rym: Yeah, they kept saying one died, but I didn't really think about it.

403
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,360
Rym: So I was fighting some mob limbs that were way more dangerous than any right to be in a place.

404
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:14,675
Rym: That is way more dangerous than I expected and they fucking killed my horse.

405
00:25:15,116 --> 00:25:16,879
Rym: Yeah, but now my good horse I don't really care.

406
00:25:17,563 --> 00:25:21,839
Rym: It was uh, it was a horse that I got because I thought it was good and then I found way better horses.

407
00:25:22,643 --> 00:25:25,859
Rym: But yeah now I know that horses can die and it's real sad.

408
00:25:26,383 --> 00:25:28,095
Rym: Emily was like is that horse dead?

409
00:25:28,115 --> 00:25:32,716
Rym: and I was like I think that horse died and she was real upset about it because I let my horse die.

410
00:25:32,817 --> 00:25:33,600
Scott: They got hit points.

411
00:25:34,222 --> 00:25:38,480
Rym: Yeah, so luckily my main horse sunset is pretty strong.

412
00:25:39,202 --> 00:25:40,466
Rym: I feel like sunsets invincible.

413
00:25:40,506 --> 00:25:42,792
Scott: Mostly my main horse is not Epona.

414
00:25:43,535 --> 00:25:46,813

415
00:25:47,015 --> 00:25:54,416
Rym: Yeah I got the giant horse, but the funniest thing about that giant horse is that giant horse is named kaku.

416
00:25:54,917 --> 00:25:58,053
Rym: Oh, I named mine Calamitous, but kaku.

417
00:25:58,154 --> 00:26:03,453
Rym: Oh, yeah That's the actual name of that Because I know where that horse came from.

Rym: I know one island.

419
00:26:06,081 --> 00:26:20,408

422
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:42,260
Rym: But raising yeah, but they were like the big horse was like convening a council of horses around himself.

423
00:26:42,401 --> 00:26:44,559

00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:27,020
Rym: But I am bringing back advanced wars with Rym because actually a lot of you have been asking me for that.

Rym: I don't know.

468
00:29:16,322 --> 00:29:17,969
Rym: I'm real good at arrow biz.

469
00:29:18,009 --> 00:29:19,334
Scott: play against him in a row biz.

470
00:29:19,535 --> 00:29:21,964
Rym: Whoo Cuz you won't play against me.

471
00:29:22,767 --> 00:29:25,656
Rym: No, so yeah, we are we're doing double feature here.

472
00:29:25,716 --> 00:29:26,780
Rym: cuz these are two little comics.

473
00:29:27,566 --> 00:29:29,159
Rym: They could not be more different.

474
00:29:30,701 --> 00:29:32,006
Rym: That is well, I know.

475
00:29:32,106 --> 00:29:35,056
Scott: one of them is actual manga and one of them is manga influenced.

476
00:29:35,257 --> 00:29:36,000
Rym: Yeah, manga ask.

477
00:29:36,401 --> 00:29:37,930
Scott: So we'll talk about that first.

478
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:44,894
Scott: So basically, you know, I've heard of Not the dissolving classroom, but the diss is a disappearing classroom.

479
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:46,459
Scott: Yeah, I think is the other one.

480
00:29:47,021 --> 00:29:48,688
Scott: There might even be more in the series.

481
00:29:48,708 --> 00:29:51,297
Rym: Well, so this didn't even of a series.

482
00:29:51,337 --> 00:29:52,020
Scott: I didn't even realize.

483
00:29:52,861 --> 00:29:53,565
Rym: Several I think it's.

484
00:29:53,786 --> 00:29:54,751
Rym: I want to say there's five.

485
00:29:55,012 --> 00:29:56,560
Scott: I didn't even realize it was a series.

486
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,763
Rym: Oh, there's seven of them.

487
00:29:57,803 --> 00:29:58,345
Scott: What are they?

488
00:29:58,365 --> 00:30:03,177
Rym: dissolving classroom meet again children of the earth worshiping beauty or dissolving beauty.

489
00:30:03,437 --> 00:30:04,260
Rym: dissolving apartment.

490
00:30:04,842 --> 00:30:05,625
Rym: She's a cheese.

491
00:30:05,645 --> 00:30:10,142
Rym: It means dissolving love and the demons conference is gonna be the last one Right.

492
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:13,051
Scott: So like, you know, there's two different classroom ones, right?

493
00:30:13,653 --> 00:30:22,411
Scott: Anyway, anyway, I didn't realize it - they're all they're all by Junji ito, but Junji Ito You probably know from.

494
00:30:22,431 --> 00:30:33,640
Rym: you probably don't know the name of it But you've definitely encountered the weird spiral manga Because people like to post screenshots of that all the time all over the internet with no context.

495
00:30:33,701 --> 00:30:34,580
Rym: So that's what that is.

496
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:39,599
Scott: The thing is it's like this Junji Ito is a name you associate with like Japanese horror manga, right?

497
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,003
Scott: Who did the?

498
00:30:41,324 --> 00:30:42,509
Scott: what's the one with the fish?

499
00:30:42,569 --> 00:30:43,453
Scott: is that Uzumaki?

500
00:30:43,573 --> 00:30:44,457
Scott: Is that also Junji?

501
00:30:44,497 --> 00:30:45,280
Scott: That's Junji Ito.

502
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:49,380
Scott: Alright, I feel like there's one other person who also does horror manga.

503
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:56,771
Scott: That's super famous and like but I just get them confused all the time because they all blend together because the styles feel similar well, because yeah, I mean.

504
00:30:56,912 --> 00:31:06,573
Rym: obviously there's a lot of Variants in there, but most of the Japanese visual media like drawn or animated horror I've encountered has pretty much looked like this.

505
00:31:06,593 --> 00:31:13,479
Rym: I mean Well, I mean other than yamashibai which is a similar style in a lot of ways.

506
00:31:14,283 --> 00:31:17,599
Rym: That's I mostly encounter yamashibai and Junji Ito.

507
00:31:18,825 --> 00:31:27,587
Rym: so this comic is straight-up body horror in a Japanese style Like that is it?

508
00:31:27,667 --> 00:31:32,945
Rym: in a nutshell if body horror is Your jam you will like this.

509
00:31:33,427 --> 00:31:38,585
Rym: if body horror bothers you you will hate this and you should not read it because you will hate it.

510
00:31:40,421 --> 00:31:54,292
Rym: So the story is basically about this normal-looking dude and this really scary looking girl who is this younger sister and If you encounter them your brains probably going to melt.

511
00:31:54,373 --> 00:31:56,040
Rym: and that's pretty much the entire plot.

512
00:31:56,625 --> 00:31:58,160
Scott: Yeah, it's like I didn't know what this was.

513
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:02,340
Scott: I just knew it was like a famous horror manga and I didn't realize it was a series.

514
00:32:02,581 --> 00:32:10,720
Scott: but it showed up and I read it and it was way quick to read which is nice and I didn't know exactly what the story was at all.

515
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:18,740
Scott: I knew as I figured it was gonna be about us like a You know a school of kids in class in a classroom and that horror shit would keep happening to them.

516
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,367
Scott: But no that was only like the beginning part.

517
00:32:21,548 --> 00:32:29,060
Scott: and then it's actually these multiple stories that are only linked together a little Bit kind of because there's a few characters they keep going through.

518
00:32:29,887 --> 00:32:30,734
Scott: Right the whole thing.

519
00:32:30,855 --> 00:32:40,780
Rym: Yep So the basically you're introduced to these characters and if you'd start reading it You're gonna think wow that sister is super scary and dangerous and the kids just trying to deal with it.

520
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,880
Scott: Yeah, what's the deal with this kid who has a crazy evil sister who's murdering everyone?

521
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,160
Scott: He can't keep her under control.

522
00:32:46,802 --> 00:32:51,960
Rym: The moral of this is that kid is a bad person and he deserves all this even though actually he seems to be enjoying himself.

523
00:32:52,664 --> 00:32:53,771
Rym: You can't tell right?

524
00:32:53,831 --> 00:32:55,340
Scott: It's sort of it's somewhat ambiguous.

525
00:32:55,541 --> 00:33:05,880
Rym: Well, it's all ambiguous because I feel like those two characters exist Primarily from face value as a vehicle to get body horror into your eyes.

526
00:33:06,322 --> 00:33:07,368
Scott: Yeah, pretty much they are.

527
00:33:07,388 --> 00:33:15,119
Rym: they're just a vehicle for body horror Mostly around your body melting or becoming horrifying in some way and you can't get around it.

528
00:33:15,582 --> 00:33:22,015
Rym: but on a much more meta level the When you read this and I'm not gonna spoil too much because you know, you can just read this thing

529
00:33:22,055 --> 00:33:22,376
Scott: Satan,

530
00:33:22,737 --> 00:33:33,420
Rym: but yeah Originally, he sort of portrays himself as like yeah, I'm cursed by the devil my sister, you know I messed with devil shit and now my sister is cursed and I'm trying to protect her and live my life.

531
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:39,400
Rym: I'm so sorry, but then the sister is like, yeah, he was fucking torturing animals and Satan came after him.

532
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,565
Scott: He fucking loves the devil.

533
00:33:41,289 --> 00:33:42,535
Scott: He's not he's not accident.

534
00:33:42,595 --> 00:33:43,640
Scott: He's like he's Satan's best.

535
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:51,193
Rym: I really like oh I tortured animals as a kid because That's how I relieve stress in my life and that no he's like.

536
00:33:51,213 --> 00:33:53,140
Scott: no you tortured animals cuz you love Satan.

537
00:33:53,684 --> 00:34:09,014
Rym: Yeah, like you want him to love you back But the G you find find out like early on that the deal is if he apologizes to you Satan gives him an orgasm essentially and your brain starts melting.

538
00:34:09,637 --> 00:34:20,380
Rym: and the more he Apologizes to you the more your brain melts until you die and then melt into a puddle And the sister eats your brains and you or they store it in bottles.

539
00:34:21,482 --> 00:34:23,509
Rym: You think that is too much of a spoiler.

540
00:34:23,549 --> 00:34:27,924
Rym: his other seems like the first ten pages and it just goes off from his other Superpower is.

541
00:34:27,984 --> 00:34:32,418
Scott: he tells people how pretty they are and they become ugly but think they're pretty.

542
00:34:32,458 --> 00:34:40,344
Scott: when he does this It's like more the more he says well also being like this heart, you know, like gross-out kind of horror Thing.

543
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:49,420
Scott: it's also this commentary in Japanese society Which you know has worse problems than America does in terms of you know, personal appearance.

544
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,045
Scott: Issues now bear in mind.

545
00:34:51,065 --> 00:34:55,540
Scott: we earned also constantly apologizing even when you're not the person who did anything wrong.

546
00:34:55,620 --> 00:35:07,757
Rym: we are neither Japanese nor experts on Japanese culture, but the plot of this dude Apologizes to people all the time to basically be on one hand.

547
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:11,680
Rym: He does bad things and his sisters does bad things.

548
00:35:11,961 --> 00:35:17,798
Rym: He apologizes for those things and everyone around him is sort of obligated to accept those apologies.

549
00:35:17,918 --> 00:35:20,305
Scott: and he likes Apologizing a lot.

550
00:35:20,526 --> 00:35:21,127
Rym: but think about this.

551
00:35:21,408 --> 00:35:29,592
Rym: you do something bad and then you are automatically forgiven By society whether or not you should be forgive.

552
00:35:29,612 --> 00:35:32,300
Scott: you are forgiven for melting these people's brains and loving Satan.

553
00:35:32,742 --> 00:35:37,140
Rym: Yeah, but so he apologizes to people and they have to accept it.

554
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:40,180
Rym: So as a result, he gets to keep doing these terrible things to people.

555
00:35:40,441 --> 00:35:44,320
Rym: But also he is not actually ever apologizing because he's sorry.

556
00:35:44,641 --> 00:35:50,900
Rym: He's apologizing for his own selfish reasons and taking advantage of the fact that other people will accept those apologies.

557
00:35:51,262 --> 00:35:58,919
Rym: Mm-hmm, and the one girl who was sort of saved from this Really is only saved because she passes out before he can keep apologizing to her.

558
00:35:59,221 --> 00:36:05,220
Rym: Yeah, but she has her whole arc which she tries to expose them and I'm not gonna spoil whether or not she succeeds.

559
00:36:05,866 --> 00:36:09,299
Scott: The point is in him, you know If you want to read some horror mangas, right?

560
00:36:09,782 --> 00:36:12,112
Scott: Is like the go-to of the horror manga.

561
00:36:12,293 --> 00:36:14,020
Rym: cuz these guys these are direct.

562
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,786
Rym: These are like you want to see some horror?

563
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:16,549
Rym: Let's see how many pages.

564
00:36:16,589 --> 00:36:19,860
Rym: a lot of the other zero as far as poor on the cover.

565
00:36:20,101 --> 00:36:22,219
Rym: Let's start horror in the first page.

566
00:36:23,022 --> 00:36:28,736
Rym: Okay, there's no horror in the very first page of the manga except he apologizes to everyone in the class.

567
00:36:29,298 --> 00:36:33,250
Rym: one two Three four up there's there's some horror.

568
00:36:33,652 --> 00:36:36,120
Rym: Anyway, the point is let me suck your brains out here.

569
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:42,680
Scott: Bigger series like this go which is the one with the fish and Uzumaki, which is I think the spiral one, right?

570
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,659
Scott: Oh, it's like those are longer series.

571
00:36:45,001 --> 00:36:46,610
Scott: So you might not know if you're into this.

572
00:36:46,891 --> 00:36:48,620
Scott: like you don't want to go into you can just read this.

573
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,359
Scott: It's like a one-shot tiny deal.

574
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:57,954
Scott: It's like be your intro to the world of this kind of style of manga To figure out if you want to go deeper and read the rest of everything out there.

575
00:36:58,255 --> 00:37:13,560
Rym: Yep, or not what's cool is at the very end after you learn a bunch more about Satan and Whether or not the story resolves itself because it resolves itself to a degree You get a couple of really really short like four-page comics.

576
00:37:14,581 --> 00:37:16,467
Rym: Did you read those at the very end like after the story?

577
00:37:17,049 --> 00:37:19,015
Scott: Yeah, and I remember them.

578
00:37:19,216 --> 00:37:26,717
Rym: They're not about people melting They're just like horror vignettes like really simple ones that are kind of interesting.

579
00:37:26,737 --> 00:37:36,328
Rym: I It's hard for me to be super like generally objective about a review of this kind of stuff Because I really like horror in general.

580
00:37:36,368 --> 00:37:40,800
Rym: I mean, I listen to pseudopod like constantly like I like contemporary horror fiction.

581
00:37:40,901 --> 00:37:43,503
Scott: I've been watching horror movies since I was like I would really like.

582
00:37:43,543 --> 00:37:47,420
Scott: I just I just like this for like the pictures of Satan and the pictures of people's heads melting.

583
00:37:47,661 --> 00:37:49,893
Scott: Yeah, right that alone is enough for me to read it.

584
00:37:49,913 --> 00:37:51,100
Scott: But is it enough for you to read it?

585
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,460
Scott: It might make you want to not read it depending on who you are.

586
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,082
Rym: Yeah, I like.

587
00:37:54,142 --> 00:37:56,308
Scott: I cannot stress this and it's not for everybody.

588
00:37:56,329 --> 00:38:06,040
Rym: if you do not like body horror, which is a very Specific genre of horror then you will not like this at all.

589
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:10,974
Scott: If you don't want to see a human body doing things human bodies don't do.

590
00:38:10,994 --> 00:38:11,055
Scott: Yep.

591
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:12,639
Scott: Don't look at this.

592
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:22,679
Rym: If you're were if you were bothered by irrevocable diffuse harm to your person Because this is pretty horrifying shit, and I love it.

593
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:25,268
Rym: So there's not much else to say.

594
00:38:25,308 --> 00:38:27,900
Scott: I'm not gonna spoil a big manga, which is why we're doing a two-shot.

595
00:38:28,364 --> 00:38:30,140
Rym: But it goes way.

596
00:38:30,301 --> 00:38:31,387
Rym: It just goes.

597
00:38:31,467 --> 00:38:32,614
Rym: you're gonna think like, okay.

598
00:38:32,634 --> 00:38:33,700
Rym: I see what's going on with this.

599
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:38,738
Rym: No, it'll escalate like page by page and never stop escalating.

600
00:38:38,799 --> 00:38:41,611
Scott: Yep So the other thing we read is wrecked heart.

601
00:38:41,631 --> 00:38:43,560
Scott: So this I got at the mocha festival this year.

602
00:38:43,961 --> 00:38:50,292
Scott: I just saw it on a table and I was like, wow, that looks really well put together And I like the colors and hearts.

603
00:38:50,493 --> 00:38:51,317
Scott: so I'm gonna buy that.

604
00:38:51,357 --> 00:38:51,860
Scott: so I bought it.

605
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,831
Scott: So what it is is it's not a manga.

606
00:38:54,851 --> 00:38:57,380
Rym: it's by two awesome artists in Sweden.

607
00:38:57,741 --> 00:39:07,007
Scott: Yeah, so it's called wrecked hearts and it's basically two different comics that have similar themes of Heartbreak and hearts.

608
00:39:07,247 --> 00:39:08,852
Rym: Well dark shoujo.

609
00:39:08,872 --> 00:39:11,299
Rym: So it's heartbreak sci-fi shoujo.

610
00:39:11,399 --> 00:39:13,532
Scott: Yes Which is already great.

611
00:39:13,694 --> 00:39:19,200
Scott: Yeah The physical publishing of it looks like a manga, right?

612
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:22,590
Scott: It's got the even has a little strip of paper that goes around the cover.

613
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:25,499
Scott: Yeah, like a manga in Japan would write and such.

614
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:27,294
Scott: So that's pretty nice.

615
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,830
Scott: Inside has got nice paper.

616
00:39:29,971 --> 00:39:37,940
Scott: The first story is Sort of got like a watercolor to it and the second story sort of has like a zip a tone deal.

617
00:39:38,081 --> 00:39:39,733
Rym: When Scott told me to read this we could read on a gig.

618
00:39:39,773 --> 00:39:45,480
Rym: not so what he said was Emily wrote Andrew the first of these two guys, so there's two stories in here.

619
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:57,944
Scott: The first story is the real thing by Luca Oliveri, which I'm pretty sure is Emily's pen name Yeah, and the second one is dark energy by mythilda kitty which is Not written by Emily.

620
00:39:58,104 --> 00:39:59,247
Rym: Yep.

621
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,932
Scott: I mean could be but it doesn't seem like it.

622
00:40:00,972 --> 00:40:01,975
Scott: The first one definitely is.

623
00:40:02,196 --> 00:40:12,888
Rym: so the first one has mysterious girls with powers and shape-changing and complicated gender roles and romance and space and Hockey, that's right.

624
00:40:12,969 --> 00:40:13,995
Scott: It doesn't have bunnies though.

625
00:40:14,297 --> 00:40:16,138
Rym: No bunnies It's like if it had bunnies.

626
00:40:19,203 --> 00:40:22,474
Rym: And the second one is more I don't know.

627
00:40:22,515 --> 00:40:29,240
Rym: it reminded me of particularly like that kind of moto-hagio type show Joe sci-fi.

628
00:40:29,581 --> 00:40:33,440
Rym: Yes story was like they were 11 to it because actually they both fit into that.

629
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,828
Rym: They were 11 mold.

630
00:40:34,969 --> 00:40:36,880
Scott: It's got some Tezuka going on in there.

631
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:43,197
Rym: The second one was way more Tezuka and the first one was way more like 70s sci-fi show Joe.

632
00:40:43,418 --> 00:40:43,538
Scott: Mm-hmm.

633
00:40:44,521 --> 00:40:45,805
Scott: But yeah, I mean they're both sort of that.

634
00:40:45,885 --> 00:40:46,949
Scott: but anyway, right.

635
00:40:46,989 --> 00:40:53,448
Scott: so the first story right you've got basically this girl and He plays hockey.

636
00:40:53,469 --> 00:40:58,545
Scott: Yep space hockey space On the moon.

637
00:40:58,565 --> 00:40:59,728
Scott: Oh, man.

638
00:40:59,828 --> 00:41:03,337
Rym: Yep, and she's just really funny and like the character.

639
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:13,699
Rym: like they're short stories They escalate pretty quickly but her dad's an alien and she's actually totally a shape-shifter with crazy powers and She's just living among the humans and can't really reveal what she really is.

640
00:41:14,724 --> 00:41:21,330
Scott: She also really has the hots for this dude, but when she dreams about the dude She dreams that she's a dude, but she's a shape-shifter.

641
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:23,236
Scott: So is she even the dude?

642
00:41:23,336 --> 00:41:24,078
Rym: is there even gender, right?

643
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:28,408
Scott: So it has that sort of, you know Transgender message going on there, right?

644
00:41:28,488 --> 00:41:31,177
Scott: It's like oh well what you know, here's a shape-shifting person.

645
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:31,839
Scott: What do you think of that?

646
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,243
Scott: Transphobic person.

647
00:41:33,263 --> 00:41:33,685
Scott: Yep.

648
00:41:34,006 --> 00:41:34,748
Rym: Yeah gender.

649
00:41:34,869 --> 00:41:35,892
Scott: Yeah, how about that?

650
00:41:35,972 --> 00:41:49,455
Rym: Yeah, and and it's a short stories We're not gonna really spoil anything But you sort of pieced together that part of the reason why she dreams that she's a dude when she's with him is because he had a boyfriend who may or may not be dead.

651
00:41:49,475 --> 00:41:54,693
Rym: hmm and She is not allowed to use her powers because her dad told her not to.

652
00:41:54,713 --> 00:41:59,920
Scott: and she decides Well, you don't want everyone to know that you're a shape-shifting alien when they don't know shape-shifting aliens exist.

653
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,574
Rym: Yeah It's not clear that anyone knows that aliens exist at all.

654
00:42:04,136 --> 00:42:09,620
Rym: in like this world Like the fact that she's an alien could be a real real problem if it got out.

655
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,571
Scott: But apparently they do have space travel.

656
00:42:11,592 --> 00:42:12,899
Scott: they go and do it on the moon and shit.

657
00:42:13,745 --> 00:42:24,099
Rym: but she decides to have this plan to Shape-shift into a dude and go on an all-male hockey trip with them.

658
00:42:24,743 --> 00:42:25,951
Scott: I don't think it's an all-male hockey trip.

659
00:42:25,971 --> 00:42:27,340
Scott: I think it's just a school hockey trip.

660
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:31,110
Rym: But yeah, she has a plan that involves touching his dick.

661
00:42:31,512 --> 00:42:32,675
Scott: Yeah good plan.

662
00:42:32,815 --> 00:42:38,833
Scott: Yeah, that's a solid plan A+ and you can find you read this you'll find out how much dick-touching happens.

663
00:42:38,993 --> 00:42:41,260
Rym: Yeah, uh, this is I really liked it.

664
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,044
Rym: It's a good story.

665
00:42:42,144 --> 00:42:44,515
Scott: Yeah, and it's I mean, even though we just talked about dick-touching.

666
00:42:44,555 --> 00:42:47,450
Scott: It's not like a porn It's not a yaoi or anything like that.

667
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:49,560
Scott: It's not graphic sexually in any way.

668
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:52,710
Scott: It's appropriate for young teens who at least know what sex is.

669
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:54,235
Rym: Yeah, this is like 13 14 and up, right?

670
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,317
Scott: I mean this is worse shit on TV in primetime than this.

671
00:42:58,337 --> 00:43:09,766
Rym: and It does the thing that I like about this that I don't want to say this era of shoujo or this era of this kind of sci-fi because This is from this current era.

672
00:43:09,806 --> 00:43:16,767
Rym: This is contemporary science fiction, but that 70s style like Japanese shoujo sci-fi.

673
00:43:17,348 --> 00:43:27,640
Rym: it really covers that those kinds of issues in that kind of way and It addresses its subject matter in a really interesting and thoughtful way without spelling it all out for you.

674
00:43:27,861 --> 00:43:35,042
Scott: And also, I mean the second story does this also, but it is not go where you predict it's gonna go Can't?

675
00:43:35,062 --> 00:43:36,411
Rym: we can't like it's.

676
00:43:36,431 --> 00:43:37,960
Scott: it is a fresh story, right?

677
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:42,497
Scott: It is not some old tired trope that is repeated right is totally fresh.

678
00:43:42,618 --> 00:43:50,996
Rym: Yeah and Refreshing to read the second story is dark energy Vaguely because I really don't want to ruin much about it because you should read it.

679
00:43:51,017 --> 00:43:51,540
Rym: It's really good.

680
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,588
Scott: It's got some cuteness going on a lot of cuteness.

681
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:56,460
Rym: It is much more Tezuka sci-fi in a lot of ways.

682
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,869
Scott: Like you said, yeah, it's got a little katamari action.

683
00:43:58,909 --> 00:43:59,210
Scott: There's

684
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:01,739
Rym: a cute little robot guy who kind of looks like a taiko drum

685
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:02,904
Scott: Yeah, and

686
00:44:03,185 --> 00:44:15,000
Rym: he can turn into a boy but only for a little while at a time or it rains his battery Mm-hmm, and there's this girl with a mysterious past who's alone on a spaceship and may or may not also be a plant on the spaceship

687
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:20,520
Scott: Right that she lives on a spaceship that basically is a place that grows plants and she's all alone on there.

688
00:44:21,102 --> 00:44:32,017
Rym: Right and she meets this robot almost like a biodome kind of deal and they hang out together And the robot has a crush on her and it escalates while the robots lonely in space.

689
00:44:32,098 --> 00:44:32,900
Scott: and so is this girl.

690
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:50,568
Scott: So you meet the first person you meet and saying like if I'm not like regardless of who the hell they are It could be ugly fat that guy Yep right and if I'm alone in space for a long period of time and I end up on a space station and the only living thing there is That guy I mean, I

691
00:44:51,109 --> 00:44:52,052
Rym: don't feel it now,

692
00:44:52,153 --> 00:44:59,622
Scott: but I could imagine even going that far Suddenly be real to be into the lonely fat that guy like oh my god It's a person.

693
00:45:00,104 --> 00:45:02,191
Scott: even the worst person is better than no person.

694
00:45:02,432 --> 00:45:05,020
Scott: interaction of any kind and this is a great person.

695
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:06,125
Scott: It's a cute plant girl.

696
00:45:06,345 --> 00:45:07,450
Rym: Yeah, cute plant girl.

697
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:07,932
Rym: Thank you.

698
00:45:08,093 --> 00:45:09,338
Rym: I go drama robot cute.

699
00:45:09,458 --> 00:45:09,840
Scott: I go dry.

700
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:16,899
Rym: potentially cute space girl who might be the other girls ex is also totally badass.

701
00:45:16,919 --> 00:45:17,060
Scott: and

702
00:45:18,181 --> 00:45:28,263
Rym: to not really say anything else about where this goes it deals with a Bunch of issues in a really oblique way Yeah the ideas of in

703
00:45:28,303 --> 00:45:34,340
Scott: a really short amount of time and without and it still leaves space space for space stuff and cute stuff

704
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:45,540
Rym: Yep, and also like really existential stuff, but self-identity toxic relationships Past relationships in light of the future loneliness.

705
00:45:47,082 --> 00:45:49,751
Rym: And like I said, it deals with these in really oblique ways.

706
00:45:49,892 --> 00:45:57,680
Rym: both of these comics, but particularly the second one They're like the failure of a lot of contemporary science fiction is spelling out.

707
00:45:58,081 --> 00:45:59,125
Rym: Here's the question.

708
00:45:59,245 --> 00:46:03,140
Scott: I am asking in right like the first one is a little less subtle with its.

709
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,769
Scott: You know, we are going to discuss trans things.

710
00:46:06,111 --> 00:46:08,078
Scott: Yeah, right, even though it does a really good job.

711
00:46:08,118 --> 00:46:09,592
Rym: gender identity It's not issues.

712
00:46:09,653 --> 00:46:18,280
Rym: attraction It's not super subtle and in like that is my message But it brings in a lot of ancillary and related issues in subtle ways to complement the story.

713
00:46:18,561 --> 00:46:32,201
Rym: This other one is like here is a story and if you're clever you'll realize oh It's about like these four or five things And it doesn't really give you a clear answer.

714
00:46:32,301 --> 00:46:51,424
Scott: it just says have you thought about this stuff Mmm, and I don't want to say a lot more because it's if you want to read some not manga that has very nice contemporary and modern ish Storytelling with really good arts in a really nice Publication format.

715
00:46:51,805 --> 00:46:53,290
Scott: I don't know how you can get this thing.

716
00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:54,895
Rym: You can buy it on this website right here.

717
00:46:55,397 --> 00:46:56,260
Scott: Oh, how about that?

718
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:02,420
Scott: So yeah, I bought had to buy it at a really indie comic-con, but you can buy it on some website.

719
00:47:03,102 --> 00:47:08,075
Scott: The website seems legit and I'm sure if you give that website money, they will send you this comic.

720
00:47:08,757 --> 00:47:09,459
Scott: I'm confident.

721
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:19,820
Rym: Funniest thing is it's not just that it looks like Emily drew it but that character Shapeshifter in a lot of ways also reminds me of Emily.

722
00:47:20,101 --> 00:47:28,190
Rym: I'm just saying because I always if Emily's left her own devices and she just falls asleep anywhere in a bed on a couch or Anything she pretty much looks like that by the end not bundled enough.

723
00:47:28,832 --> 00:47:36,972
Rym: Yeah, she's not bundled enough, but holding the pillow and ruling I'm just saying I'm Somewhat confident that what's the person Luca?

724
00:47:37,173 --> 00:47:38,540
Scott: Is that the one who did the first comic?

725
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:39,122
Rym: I think so.

726
00:47:39,142 --> 00:47:41,899
Scott: I'm pretty sure Luca Oliveri is Emily's fan name.

727
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:44,370
Rym: Yeah, or they there might be.

728
00:47:44,411 --> 00:47:46,380
Rym: they might be doppelgangers of each other or something.

729
00:47:46,982 --> 00:47:54,640
Rym: There is a shared sensibility into how to make a sci-fi shoujo story.

730
00:48:00,913 --> 00:48:03,450
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
