1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,924
Rym: It's Tuesday, January 3rd, 2017.

2
00:00:10,924 --> 00:00:11,145
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:11,225 --> 00:00:20,900
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight overcooked.

4
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:23,795
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:25,642 --> 00:00:27,835
Rym: So normally this would be in the meta, but I guess it counts as news.

6
00:00:27,996 --> 00:00:30,829
Rym: very briefly Magfest is this week.

7
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,195
Scott: Why didn't you put that in the meta?

8
00:00:32,216 --> 00:00:32,959
Scott: Why are you saying that now?

9
00:00:33,821 --> 00:00:38,160
Rym: I'm it would be meta if I talked about what we're doing at magfest, but magfest is this week, okay?

10
00:00:39,264 --> 00:00:46,869
Rym: If you're going to magfest and you don't already have a badge They will technically be selling them at the door.

11
00:00:46,889 --> 00:00:50,820
Rym: However, they have said definitively they're going to sell out.

12
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,266
Rym: It's just a matter of when like.

13
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:57,596
Rym: if you show up at the Gaylord and you don't already have a badge pre-reg You're playing with fire.

14
00:00:57,697 --> 00:01:03,192
Scott: You might People I see online selling their badges for like 50 bucks.

15
00:01:03,353 --> 00:01:11,460
Scott: Yep, so you can get one if you're proactive Yep, but don't expect to get one if you're way to the last second irresponsible.

16
00:01:11,901 --> 00:01:13,486
Rym: Also, they only now have they're.

17
00:01:13,527 --> 00:01:17,740
Rym: they're being smart because once it once the con sells out and will reliably sell out forever.

18
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,900
Rym: You can change a bunch of business like Otakon changes rules about single-day badges.

19
00:01:22,181 --> 00:01:24,392
Rym: Pax got rid of the four-day badges to try to like.

20
00:01:24,432 --> 00:01:25,819
Rym: there's all this stuff that can happen.

21
00:01:26,341 --> 00:01:28,149
Rym: Magfest got rid of single-day badges.

22
00:01:28,631 --> 00:01:30,660
Rym: So instead what they do now is there's only one kind of badge.

23
00:01:31,003 --> 00:01:34,019
Rym: You can't show up on Friday and be like, yeah Can I get a Friday and a Sunday badge?

24
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:43,698
Rym: What you can do is you can always buy a four-day badge and every day that four-day badge gets cheaper Like if you buy it on Sunday, what if I want to do Friday only can I return my bed?

25
00:01:43,738 --> 00:01:49,978
Scott: No Because magfest but Sunday only is like dirt cheap because nothing.

26
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:55,469
Rym: yeah I mean magfest is basically doing the opposite of packs and turkeys, you know Good gaming con sell out.

27
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,119
Rym: that is just the reality of the world.

28
00:01:57,882 --> 00:01:58,966
Rym: You kids think this is bad.

29
00:01:59,006 --> 00:02:05,408
Rym: try to get tickets to like a major sporting event for the good team in a major city or Like well popular concert.

30
00:02:05,508 --> 00:02:07,214
Scott: Well, I mean they just charge more money, right?

31
00:02:07,255 --> 00:02:08,680
Scott: It's like oh you want to go to the Super Bowl?

32
00:02:09,223 --> 00:02:13,350
Scott: No problem $5,000 P. Yeah, it's like.

33
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,278
Rym: it's not like everyone who wants to go to the Super Bowl can hit f5.

34
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:20,230
Scott: People are complaining so much about like oh my god.

35
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,354
Scott: I can't get a pecs badge.

36
00:02:21,434 --> 00:02:22,056
Scott: It's not fair.

37
00:02:22,136 --> 00:02:23,260
Scott: cuz I got a reload.

38
00:02:23,381 --> 00:02:25,392
Scott: I'm not available on the internet at the time.

39
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:26,136
Scott: They go on sale.

40
00:02:26,196 --> 00:02:29,620
Scott: It's like alright Would you rather have a pecs badge be a thousand dollars?

41
00:02:30,681 --> 00:02:32,428
Scott: I don't think you have a thousand dollars.

42
00:02:32,449 --> 00:02:45,014
Rym: a pecs move toward for individual day badges Because a lot of people it basically it generally lets more humans go to packs though Not every human will necessarily easily get to experience all four days.

43
00:02:45,034 --> 00:02:51,080
Rym: A lot of those humans don't deserve four days But the idea is that they want to hide like they want new people to keep experiencing packs.

44
00:02:51,501 --> 00:03:01,868
Rym: magfest is going the more the opposite way of only four day badges because Generally, the magfest experience is best Experienced by going for all four days.

45
00:03:01,908 --> 00:03:08,372
Rym: like you go into this place and you emerge Well some days later not quite sure what day magfest.

46
00:03:08,412 --> 00:03:10,440
Rym: try to remember what the fuck your job is in real life.

47
00:03:10,521 --> 00:03:11,631
Scott: The thing is that magfest is 24/7, right?

48
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:13,985
Scott: Yeah, we can control.

49
00:03:14,065 --> 00:03:18,564
Scott: when you get in you don't have a badge yet, but when you leave it's like, okay What are they do at midnight?

50
00:03:18,604 --> 00:03:30,720
Scott: go into the concert as it's happening find everyone with a Saturday badge and kick their ass out And then at midnight suddenly let the people with Sunday badges waiting to go to the concert run into it while it's halfway.

51
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,820
Scott: It's not logistically feasible.

52
00:03:33,961 --> 00:03:34,584
Rym: This is one of those things.

53
00:03:34,685 --> 00:03:42,540
Rym: everyone who thinks they have a good idea about anything about running cons Like you really don't understand the logistics of how this actually works unless you've actually run this stuff professionally.

54
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,279
Scott: They can like pull the fire alarm at a certain time kick everyone out and then let everyone back in.

55
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,175
Rym: Well, Otakon used to do that at 2 a.m.

56
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:55,765
Scott: Right, but I mean, you know It's like say kick out all the people with the one day badge of today then let in all the people with the one day Badge of tomorrow.

57
00:03:55,946 --> 00:03:58,460
Scott: Yeah, and then people instead go hide up in hotel rooms.

58
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:00,963
Scott: Whatever plus.

59
00:04:01,003 --> 00:04:05,120
Rym: also magfest is the kind of con where you can have a lot of fun lobby conning it like for real.

60
00:04:05,307 --> 00:04:11,726
Rym: Oh, yeah Like if you don't care about getting into tabletop and you don't care about the arcade or the concerts Which means you're dumb and you probably shouldn't be there.

61
00:04:11,746 --> 00:04:17,149
Rym: like there's room parties going 24/7 at that con You can just go to room party like.

62
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:19,000
Rym: I know people who don't have badges There's gonna be.

63
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:26,606
Scott: they're basically hosting room parties the entire time and fully enjoying a magfest because people with badges spend half the time At room parties.

64
00:04:26,647 --> 00:04:29,492
Rym: anyway, yep John will be at the room parties.

65
00:04:29,552 --> 00:04:30,740
Rym: I assume he's at this magfest?

66
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,195
Scott: I don't know.

67
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,143
Scott: But anyway, it's just.

68
00:04:32,223 --> 00:04:38,633
Rym: it's an interesting thing to look at thinking think to this moment five ten years from now We're these opposite philosophies.

69
00:04:38,674 --> 00:04:53,720
Rym: if they continue unabated magfest I predict will end up being a Family of people where like 70 80 percent of the people who go to magfest now are the same people going Five years from now just already been that way for more than five years.

70
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,615
Rym: well packs is going to increasingly be a mix of young new old.

71
00:04:57,635 --> 00:05:03,392
Rym: you two like every Part of gaming will be at packs But some of the older people will be pushed out due to this.

72
00:05:03,493 --> 00:05:04,900
Rym: one day badge and the churn and the price.

73
00:05:05,443 --> 00:05:06,108
Rym: We'll see how it goes.

74
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,506
Rym: but magfest is great And you should be there.

75
00:05:10,089 --> 00:05:10,733
Rym: So you got any news?

76
00:05:10,874 --> 00:05:11,900
Scott: There's a lot of news going on.

77
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,513
Scott: So first of all frog fractions 2 is out, but it's crazy.

78
00:05:16,994 --> 00:05:18,097
Scott: I mean, well, it's frog fraction.

79
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:23,560
Rym: So, of course Crazy about a game that teaches kids fractions with frogs anyway.

80
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:26,073
Scott: So you should know what frog fractions 1 is.

81
00:05:26,153 --> 00:05:27,440
Scott: if not, you can play it for free.

82
00:05:27,521 --> 00:05:30,179
Scott: Just type frog fractions into the internet and play it.

83
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:41,284
Scott: Yeah Like if you don't know why we're talking about this game go go play that game Just frog fractions 2 did a kickstarter and they said you won't know when we actually release frog fractions 2 But we will.

84
00:05:41,887 --> 00:05:42,590
Scott: so people.

85
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:48,989
Scott: there was an ARG which had clues Interspersed throughout multiple like indie games on steam.

86
00:05:49,571 --> 00:05:53,381
Scott: right there were clues as to where frog fractions 2 was and someone finally figured it Out.

87
00:05:53,763 --> 00:05:54,847
Scott: there's some game on steam.

88
00:05:54,867 --> 00:05:55,872
Scott: I don't even know the name of it.

89
00:05:55,912 --> 00:06:11,458
Scott: It's like something fairies or whatever Right, which actually is a game you can play but hidden inside of that game is frog fractions 2 and Then frog fractions 2 has a lot of crazy shit in it.

90
00:06:12,182 --> 00:06:15,414
Scott: Including I saw one part where you have to load.

91
00:06:15,715 --> 00:06:30,560
Scott: one part looks like to our fortress another part as it looks like Windows 3.1 and another part has you like Loading in your Mass Effect save files into the frog fractions 2 and it does something with them that I'm not sure of?

92
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,570
Rym: Yeah, maybe nothing like, you know.

93
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:33,756
Rym: these things go who knows.

94
00:06:33,817 --> 00:06:39,497
Scott: but yeah If you already frog fractions 1 you can now frog fractions 2.

95
00:06:39,497 --> 00:06:40,400
Scott: I also have a geek bite.

96
00:06:40,563 --> 00:06:44,294
Scott: I played this game Owlboy, which is it was making the rounds like.

97
00:06:44,334 --> 00:06:45,922
Rym: we saw it at a bunch of cons I saw.

98
00:06:45,962 --> 00:06:53,799
Scott: I saw it at PAX and it looked incredible super high reviews like characters On the steam sale, so I'm like, alright, I'll buy this.

99
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,864
Scott: I got a whole week of nothing to do.

100
00:06:56,525 --> 00:07:06,853
Scott: So I bought it and I played it and But just below the top of steer which is still amazing.

101
00:07:06,913 --> 00:07:08,180
Scott: pixel arts like it looks good.

102
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:13,800
Scott: I was like good and the music while not like memorable music is well-made music.

103
00:07:13,921 --> 00:07:16,342
Scott: Right, whoever made the music is good at making music It's just.

104
00:07:16,785 --> 00:07:19,300
Scott: but you're not gonna remember how many these songs right?

105
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:25,044
Rym: Not like a mega man or a Metroid music or even like an undertale where I'm just like humming those songs Constantly even today.

106
00:07:25,124 --> 00:07:26,348
Scott: right the thing with this game.

107
00:07:26,368 --> 00:07:36,463
Scott: Is that as a game is bad It's not a good game yet, it's got like perfect reviews Everywhere.

108
00:07:36,564 --> 00:07:38,711
Rym: like every critic says this game is amazing.

109
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,496
Rym: It's got five stars right Steve.

110
00:07:40,516 --> 00:07:41,640
Scott: So basically I was in review.

111
00:07:41,721 --> 00:07:42,589
Scott: It's really short.

112
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,720
Scott: First of all, right.

113
00:07:44,902 --> 00:07:48,855
Scott: So you're not really and most of the game you're not even actually playing.

114
00:07:48,956 --> 00:07:54,774
Scott: you're standing there watching Characters talk with text bubbles and pushing a a whole bunch to get through that text.

115
00:07:55,015 --> 00:07:55,316
Scott: the other.

116
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,646
Scott: it's like half the time I spent playing this.

117
00:07:57,687 --> 00:07:59,458
Scott: I think steam said I spent five hours on it.

118
00:07:59,921 --> 00:08:02,876
Scott: I spent two and a half hours reading character dialogue boxes.

119
00:08:03,398 --> 00:08:11,685
Scott: Okay The other thing is the game is I'm not gonna go into great detail because I already typed up the great detail on the forum But which I'll talk about in a minute.

120
00:08:11,886 --> 00:08:14,614
Scott: So but it has control issues.

121
00:08:14,735 --> 00:08:16,260
Scott: It has scrolling issues.

122
00:08:16,821 --> 00:08:22,259
Rym: My experience I saw you streaming it and I logged in in the middle of your stream and just watch a little bit.

123
00:08:22,499 --> 00:08:33,360
Rym: and the moment I logged in you were in this like sort of boss fight thing and I saw that every you kept triggering an event on that screen that caused a door somewhere else to open or close.

124
00:08:33,967 --> 00:08:42,428
Rym: so like You'd be in the middle of doing something and then the game would like pause and like slide the screen to the right and show This door open slide back.

125
00:08:42,628 --> 00:08:46,200
Rym: you try to do something else that it would pause again and it just kept doing this.

126
00:08:46,682 --> 00:08:47,507
Rym: And I got so frustrated.

127
00:08:47,547 --> 00:08:48,532
Rym: I stopped watching your stream.

128
00:08:48,593 --> 00:08:49,940
Scott: It has bad level design.

129
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:54,680
Scott: It has all has lots and lots of problems with the actual game part, right?

130
00:08:55,542 --> 00:08:58,412
Scott: Just one example right is like you're an owl and the.

131
00:08:58,592 --> 00:09:00,920
Scott: the conceit is that the unique game?

132
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,309
Scott: Mechanic is that you carry your friends around right?

133
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:04,051
Scott: So you're fly.

134
00:09:04,071 --> 00:09:08,560
Scott: you can fly pretty much whatever but whichever friend You're carrying is what weapon you have.

135
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,705
Scott: So it's sort of like weapon.

136
00:09:09,765 --> 00:09:13,140
Scott: choosing right is changing friends and you have a magic teleporters.

137
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,216
Scott: You can change friends as easily as you can change weapons in doom, right?

138
00:09:16,236 --> 00:09:16,799
Scott: It's no problem.

139
00:09:17,703 --> 00:09:19,250
Scott: The weapon for shooting is right.

140
00:09:19,391 --> 00:09:21,560
Scott: trigger the analog trigger, right?

141
00:09:21,941 --> 00:09:25,151
Scott: So I'm the guy with the little gun and I hold down right trigger.

142
00:09:25,171 --> 00:09:27,096
Scott: he goes pew pew pew pew pew pew pew.

143
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,733
Scott: But if I jam the right trigger and go click click click click click click click.

144
00:09:31,773 --> 00:09:33,861
Scott: He goes pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew Right.

145
00:09:34,745 --> 00:09:43,300
Scott: So the result is that if it would be fine if it was a face button I'm used to jamming on a face button like a or X or Y or B or whatever, you know, no problem.

146
00:09:43,782 --> 00:09:46,954
Scott: But because it's an analog button have to push it all the way down.

147
00:09:46,974 --> 00:09:47,676
Rym: Did you remap it?

148
00:09:47,697 --> 00:09:49,483
Scott: I Couldn't it mean?

149
00:09:49,503 --> 00:09:50,988
Scott: I don't think so.

150
00:09:51,069 --> 00:09:52,012
Scott: Maybe I'd even try.

151
00:09:52,032 --> 00:09:54,300
Scott: Yeah, like it hurt my finger to do that.

152
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:58,632
Scott: Also the button to pick up a friend and put down a friend is left.

153
00:09:58,672 --> 00:10:00,497
Scott: trigger, you know, the analog one.

154
00:10:00,578 --> 00:10:03,910
Scott: Yeah, so There's something on the ground that I want to pick up.

155
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:04,593
Scott: That's not a friend.

156
00:10:04,613 --> 00:10:05,960
Scott: It's like a vegetable which gives you health.

157
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,185
Scott: I got to pull that out of the ground.

158
00:10:07,647 --> 00:10:10,499
Scott: So I fly over to it and I'm holding a friend.

159
00:10:10,841 --> 00:10:13,960
Scott: So I push the drop button, but now I drop the friend in front of the vegetable.

160
00:10:14,901 --> 00:10:18,780
Scott: So then I go down to the ground and push the pickup button and I pick up the friend and not the vegetable.

161
00:10:19,562 --> 00:10:20,670
Scott: So, how do I get rid of the friend?

162
00:10:20,711 --> 00:10:21,940
Scott: There's no get rid of friend button.

163
00:10:22,061 --> 00:10:29,020
Scott: I got to fly away a little bit and throw the friend like off into the distance and Then I can pick up the vegetable and then bring the friend back.

164
00:10:29,221 --> 00:10:35,530
Scott: It's just like there's lots of annoying shit like that all over the place and you think okay Maybe the story you said half the game was story.

165
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,414
Scott: Maybe that would redeem it.

166
00:10:36,896 --> 00:10:37,700
Scott: The story is bad.

167
00:10:38,321 --> 00:10:41,976
Scott: It's a crayley crappy story and I'll give you two examples of why the story is crappy.

168
00:10:41,996 --> 00:10:47,180
Scott: at the beginning of the game You go to like the first big town, you know, there's the hometown and then the big town.

169
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,559
Scott: That's how it goes right in every video game ever.

170
00:10:50,601 --> 00:10:56,296
Scott: When you get to the big town, it's already under attack by pirates and the pirates completely destroy it spoilers.

171
00:10:56,316 --> 00:11:04,100
Scott: No, no You didn't even get to like meet anyone in the town or go to any buildings in town or talk to anyone in the town.

172
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:10,120
Scott: it's like you get there and it's blown up and Then everyone is so sad about the main capital city being blown up or whatever.

173
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:16,528
Scott: It's like you never gave me a chance to give a fuck about that city by letting me visit the shops and Talking to the characters who live there.

174
00:11:16,548 --> 00:11:20,362
Rym: I do have a counterpoint in Final Fantasy 4 Spoilers.

175
00:11:20,522 --> 00:11:29,467
Rym: when you encounter the second town the the mist village with the summoners Yeah, where you were sent unknowingly on a mission of genocide You actually don't get to interact.

176
00:11:29,487 --> 00:11:32,117
Scott: you come into the town, but you genocided that town.

177
00:11:32,177 --> 00:11:32,920
Scott: So that's different.

178
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,427
Rym: Yeah, you got a prior.

179
00:11:34,467 --> 00:11:36,375
Scott: you had a prior experience with the town.

180
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:45,020
Rym: to give you meaning Is literally to say you see the end you're like, oh sweet a new town It's an RPG and then you act then you genocide all over it.

181
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:57,227
Scott: Then I'm just saying right but anyway, the other thing is later in the game There's a part, you know way at the very end of the game where a character is doing something right and it's like you're trying to stop them and He's and he's like.

182
00:11:57,248 --> 00:11:58,180
Scott: I don't have time to explain.

183
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,346
Scott: I'm not gonna tell you guys.

184
00:11:59,808 --> 00:12:01,416
Scott: and it's like just tell us.

185
00:12:01,436 --> 00:12:10,657
Scott: he's like no All right, then we're gonna have to fight you to make sunglasses Right and then yeah, it's basically put on the sunglasses and then we fight and then we're done fighting.

186
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:11,780
Scott: he explains himself.

187
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,820
Scott: It's like oh we were on the same side all along and it's like go fuck yourself.

188
00:12:16,981 --> 00:12:20,114
Scott: You had time to explain apparently, but you just didn't want to.

189
00:12:20,215 --> 00:12:21,500
Scott: so we had to have this boss fight.

190
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:28,952
Scott: You could have just fucking explained and we would have said okay the end I mean, I have more sort of nuanced and there wasn't any reason he didn't explain.

191
00:12:28,992 --> 00:12:34,505
Scott: it wasn't like oh, he's pressed for time or you know, it just Like.

192
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,740
Rym: I have a lot of nuanced thoughts and like the whole situation here.

193
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:43,103
Rym: But I guess my high-level takeaways from like this situation are that one in like generally There's still like.

194
00:12:43,123 --> 00:12:47,217
Rym: a lot of indie games are very similar to each other differing only by aesthetic.

195
00:12:47,538 --> 00:12:54,853
Rym: Mm-hmm - maybe four or five years ago in any game of this caliber because it looks really great Like it's got all the pieces in there.

196
00:12:54,893 --> 00:12:55,760
Scott: pixel art is so good.

197
00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:05,940
Rym: This would have been like in a game relative to indie games out in the market like five years ago on Steam But by 2017 standards this game does not stand out at all.

198
00:13:06,082 --> 00:13:07,499
Rym: Like there's almost no reason to play it.

199
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,509
Rym: I'm like like unless you had a very specific reason.

200
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:11,980
Rym: you wanted to play it like I was your thing.

201
00:13:12,143 --> 00:13:13,039
Scott: Why this game is bad?

202
00:13:13,202 --> 00:13:13,899
Rym: I was your thing.

203
00:13:14,301 --> 00:13:20,102
Rym: You've never played like old SNES games that do these kinds of things better and you have a lot of free time and you got The game for free.

204
00:13:20,163 --> 00:13:25,724
Scott: if you want to play a good pixel art platform or you can play like SNES Lion King or Genesis Aladdin or something.

205
00:13:25,744 --> 00:13:26,707
Scott: You don't need to play this.

206
00:13:27,148 --> 00:13:30,620
Rym: Yeah, those games have their problems, but I feel like they're not.

207
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,551
Rym: They're the same kinds of problems that this game has.

208
00:13:33,591 --> 00:13:34,857
Scott: Better at platforming than this game.

209
00:13:35,118 --> 00:14:03,020
Rym: Yeah It also brings up a you know a side point that there's generally in the modern era of the internet and the ease of creation and distribution of games in that you could make a game just by doing it on your own without a lot of investment other than your time and skill and all that business, but There will be so much competition for the attention of gamers That the vast majority of indie games are generally worth ignoring and you're not missing much.

210
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:12,700
Scott: Well, I think there's something that's happening not just you know in games especially but also other areas Is that content creation in general for a lot of things these days is multidisciplinary, right?

211
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,281
Scott: It used to be.

212
00:14:13,321 --> 00:14:21,083
Scott: the only multidisciplinary content was movies which needed, you know film and acting and music and lighting and you know All these multiple.

213
00:14:21,103 --> 00:14:23,050
Rym: you lose definition of multidisciplinary.

214
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:26,882
Scott: I'm just saying but like book doesn't require multiple disciplines It requires writing.

215
00:14:26,902 --> 00:14:28,205
Rym: Well, look at like podcast even.

216
00:14:28,245 --> 00:14:36,740
Rym: Podcast requires both have some entertaining or like some reason to be providing content and Separately, you got to know about like audio engineering, right?

217
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:40,269
Scott: And the point is that video game requires the most disciplines.

218
00:14:40,289 --> 00:14:44,140
Scott: you need art and programming and game at least, right?

219
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,046
Scott: You need at least three things.

220
00:14:45,066 --> 00:14:48,125
Rym: And if you think game design and programming are the same thing That's why your games bad.

221
00:14:48,245 --> 00:14:50,900
Scott: You need at least three things to make a video game, right?

222
00:14:51,862 --> 00:14:55,480
Scott: And the person who made our boy right was excellent at pixel art.

223
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,008
Scott: Okay, the team that made our boy.

224
00:14:58,028 --> 00:14:59,916
Scott: I don't know how many people it was competent.

225
00:14:59,977 --> 00:15:02,226
Rym: as the programming part It works like it came out.

226
00:15:02,266 --> 00:15:06,080
Scott: Yeah, it doesn't have bugs, but they're really bad at the game part.

227
00:15:06,201 --> 00:15:09,940
Scott: It's like you have to be good at all the parts or get someone who's good at all the parts.

228
00:15:10,424 --> 00:15:16,978
Scott: You can't just focus on the one part You're good at and do I do a run-of-the-mill job or just a just to get over the?

229
00:15:17,259 --> 00:15:19,300
Scott: you know The bare minimum on the other parts.

230
00:15:19,741 --> 00:15:21,706
Rym: Not that long ago.

231
00:15:21,726 --> 00:15:25,094
Rym: I would say this game was pretty good at all the parts.

232
00:15:25,595 --> 00:15:27,440
Rym: It's just there's a lot more games now.

233
00:15:27,861 --> 00:15:28,503
Scott: No, it's not.

234
00:15:28,563 --> 00:15:29,085
Scott: It's not good.

235
00:15:29,205 --> 00:15:30,027
Scott: Super Metroid is.

236
00:15:30,168 --> 00:15:34,262
Scott: I mean, oh, yeah Super Metroid is from 1990 something and this is from 2016.

237
00:15:34,262 --> 00:15:34,698
Scott: Oh, yeah.

238
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:40,950
Rym: But I suspect that like the Lion King Genesis game Not that much better than this in terms of controls.

239
00:15:41,071 --> 00:15:44,040
Scott: probably similar point is if you're making a game, right?

240
00:15:44,341 --> 00:15:47,434
Scott: You know, you have to at least look think about the greatest game in that genre.

241
00:15:47,454 --> 00:15:58,040
Scott: right if you make an action RPG It has to be so good good enough that somebody would rather play your game than play link to the past again.

242
00:15:58,783 --> 00:16:03,886
Scott: Well, if I would rather play link to the past again, then play your new action RPG It's not good enough.

243
00:16:03,927 --> 00:16:07,965
Scott: get back to work and I would rather play Super Metroid again then play.

244
00:16:07,985 --> 00:16:09,713
Scott: oh boy, I'd rather be nice.

245
00:16:09,995 --> 00:16:19,360
Rym: so I a Professional opinion that is near to mine But I'm actually mirroring the things that were told to me by multiple different people in the industry over the years.

246
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:23,657
Rym: There are two fundamental ways to have well three fundamental is to have actual success.

247
00:16:24,179 --> 00:16:31,454
Rym: one Have enough and have enough investment budget money company size Whatever to where like the revenue will work out in the end.

248
00:16:31,474 --> 00:16:32,258
Rym: You just don't care.

249
00:16:32,378 --> 00:16:32,579
Rym: luck.

250
00:16:33,463 --> 00:16:37,100
Rym: Well, I'm ignoring the luck part in terms of things you have control over.

251
00:16:37,846 --> 00:16:47,427
Rym: Two is property where people buy To focus on a niche audience that you can guaranteed Support enough to where the game will succeed.

252
00:16:47,468 --> 00:16:48,491
Rym: So for example fortress.

253
00:16:48,692 --> 00:16:51,020
Rym: Yeah dwarf fortress does not have graphics.

254
00:16:51,341 --> 00:16:56,359
Rym: However, dwarf fortress serves the desires of a player base sufficient to support that game.

255
00:16:57,364 --> 00:17:03,493
Rym: So you can make a game that's like super aesthetic like owl boy And even if the game itself like has a lot of other problems.

256
00:17:03,874 --> 00:17:05,640
Rym: like people are reviewing this game really highly.

257
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,348
Rym: So I guess people are really into owl.

258
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:09,118
Rym: furries would be really into this game.

259
00:17:10,221 --> 00:17:14,356
Rym: You know if they're into the aesthetic they might overlook the other issues with it and then that would be fine.

260
00:17:14,978 --> 00:17:28,357
Rym: or three have like polish your game far beyond where you think you need it to be and there's a lot of evidence from the inside of the game industry that the games that are remembered and that succeed and that make more money than was expected are.

261
00:17:28,377 --> 00:17:38,905
Rym: the games have spent a Significant portion of their time budget not on the game itself But on that last 10% of the game like polishing the controls like spending a month Just polishing the can.

262
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:41,352
Scott: make sure that jump is so perfect right cuz look.

263
00:17:41,433 --> 00:17:46,410
Scott: that's what Nintendo did right on every game ever Right Mario's jump always so perfect.

264
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:48,940
Scott: the fireball bounces the exact right number of pixels.

265
00:17:49,081 --> 00:17:51,780
Scott: It takes the exact right number of fireballs to kill Koopa.

266
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,728
Rym: Now if you do all those things you still might not succeed.

267
00:17:53,748 --> 00:17:56,700
Rym: video ball hasn't done great despite the fact that I think they did.

268
00:17:56,861 --> 00:17:59,139
Scott: Video ball has polished too much.

269
00:17:59,622 --> 00:18:01,328
Scott: But the problem with video balls?

270
00:18:01,348 --> 00:18:03,818
Scott: they entered into a market that Rocket League was already in.

271
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:08,594
Rym: yep Oh, that's it, but again being good does not necessarily mean you'll succeed.

272
00:18:08,634 --> 00:18:10,240
Rym: in this modern era of a million games.

273
00:18:10,762 --> 00:18:14,980
Rym: It's kind of weird to me that a game that doesn't seem that good at all like this seems to be succeeding.

274
00:18:15,722 --> 00:18:16,287
Rym: It's pretty well.

275
00:18:16,307 --> 00:18:17,740
Scott: I mean it's doing okay.

276
00:18:18,102 --> 00:18:20,962
Rym: I mean, I don't know about sales like there's no way to know like how much money It's making.

277
00:18:20,982 --> 00:18:23,835
Rym: it's a pretty expensive game, but it's got a 1500 reviews on Steam.

278
00:18:25,701 --> 00:18:28,029
Rym: I mean I bought it on Steam sale.

279
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,699
Scott: I paid too much for it, and what are they charging for it now?

280
00:18:32,242 --> 00:18:35,083
Rym: Let's see $24.99.

281
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:35,705
Scott: that's too much.

282
00:18:35,886 --> 00:18:41,504
Scott: I would buy this game not even for $5 for if you really want to play it wait for $2.50.

283
00:18:41,504 --> 00:18:54,000
Rym: less than $5 Yep, but it goes to show like if you just look at the Steam page you see this indie platformer five stars Overwhelmingly positive reviews, and if you click on all the video and look at the screenshots it looks incredible.

284
00:18:54,161 --> 00:18:56,388
Rym: It looks great like I would just buy it like oh, man.

285
00:18:56,408 --> 00:19:01,125
Rym: This game looks great, but seeing Scott play it and Knowing Scott's opinion.

286
00:19:01,567 --> 00:19:17,870
Rym: I'm pretty confident games not worth playin And I'm sorry on YouTube, but games are competitive space now, and I can't I can't give a review to charity things of the day.

287
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:27,349
Rym: someone posted this in the new GeekNights forum and It is a Viking games comma Joms Wickinger.

288
00:19:28,245 --> 00:19:34,070
Rym: Nah People were debating on the reddit thread about this whether or not the people in the video are actually speaking German.

289
00:19:34,772 --> 00:19:35,594
Rym: Maybe dodge like.

290
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,039
Rym: no one can figure out the language.

291
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:37,701
Rym: They're speaking.

292
00:19:38,022 --> 00:19:43,881
Rym: it is vaguely English, and that's the best they can come up with They might just be drunk and speaking German like no one can really tell.

293
00:19:43,901 --> 00:19:51,205
Rym: this is apparently a Viking game And the game goes as such as best we can tell from this video of people playing it.

294
00:19:51,747 --> 00:20:07,790
Rym: you get two individuals You get them moderately intoxicated you blindfold them you give them each a heavy cloth sack And you put tell them to stand around a large chest like a treasure chest And they must have at least one hand touching the chest at all times.

295
00:20:08,577 --> 00:20:09,729
Rym: That's the setup for this game.

296
00:20:10,432 --> 00:20:17,390
Rym: Then they take turns doing something like hey Scott like saying hey Scott and Scott has to say yes like Marco Polo.

297
00:20:17,992 --> 00:20:20,721
Rym: And then I say may I hit you with this bag?

298
00:20:20,741 --> 00:20:23,450
Rym: and Scott has to say hit me with the bag.

299
00:20:23,772 --> 00:20:24,577
Scott: Why do I have to say that?

300
00:20:24,597 --> 00:20:26,490
Scott: I'm gonna say no no you may not hit me with the bag.

301
00:20:26,733 --> 00:20:27,989
Rym: Well, then you know then you lose.

302
00:20:28,732 --> 00:20:32,036
Rym: so you you have to say that and Then you have to be.

303
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:34,528
Rym: you can now be quiet like I guess you could make more noise if you want to.

304
00:20:34,569 --> 00:20:48,502
Rym: you probably Don't want to and I have to try blindfolded holding and touching this chest to hit you with the sack Knowing that you are also touching the chest blindfolded and as far as I can tell from this video This game is way harder than you think it would be.

305
00:20:48,522 --> 00:20:50,190
Scott: and how big is the sack?

306
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,105
Rym: It's like I don't know.

307
00:20:52,146 --> 00:20:56,409
Rym: imagine like Half size basketball like in a cloth sack.

308
00:20:57,232 --> 00:21:03,874
Scott: I mean can you can I like how much of me has to be touching the chest door hands my hand hand has to be touching the chest.

309
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:18,890
Rym: the sack is on like a two-foot rope and like people like say their name like they say the thing and then they like lie down and like Hug the chest or like fling themselves out out of the way like this game is kind of crazy.

310
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:19,694
Scott: You know the chest is.

311
00:21:19,754 --> 00:21:23,110
Rym: look this guy's got one finger on it, and he's like getting away from the chest.

312
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,174
Scott: You're blindfolded.

313
00:21:24,214 --> 00:21:25,419
Scott: How do you know the sack is coming?

314
00:21:26,162 --> 00:21:28,189
Rym: You don't that sucks if it hits you in the face.

315
00:21:28,911 --> 00:21:29,615
Scott: Let's not play this.

316
00:21:29,816 --> 00:21:30,620
Rym: it's a Viking game.

317
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,364
Rym: What do you expect?

318
00:21:31,605 --> 00:21:32,510
Rym: This is like Scott?

319
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:36,787
Rym: This is probably not actually more Jane dangerous than how we play jungle speed.

320
00:21:37,269 --> 00:21:39,899
Rym: sure It's probably a similar level of danger anyway.

321
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:46,607
Scott: I kind of want to play this game alright, so Basketball the sport I like to watch the least.

322
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:50,846
Rym: yeah I like to watch the last two minutes of a closed basketball game sometimes in the playoffs.

323
00:21:50,946 --> 00:22:01,253
Scott: Yeah, anyway Especially NBA basketball is even worse than other basketballs, but anyway There is a player Onuaku, and he is was in like the d-league Which is like the.

324
00:22:01,273 --> 00:22:04,483
Scott: you know the the AHL of basketball that no people.

325
00:22:04,524 --> 00:22:06,430
Scott: It's like the least paid attention to League.

326
00:22:08,072 --> 00:22:12,130
Scott: I think more people care about women's basketball than d-league NBA men's basketball.

327
00:22:12,535 --> 00:22:13,790
Rym: I actually didn't know it existed.

328
00:22:14,731 --> 00:22:27,124
Scott: yeah, anyway, so but you know he got called up to the Houston Rockets a real NBA team and He happens to be somebody who shoots free throws Underhanded like a man like a few players have done in the past.

329
00:22:27,204 --> 00:22:28,108
Rym: play to win the game.

330
00:22:28,128 --> 00:22:29,765
Rym: if it works It works doesn't work.

331
00:22:30,585 --> 00:22:39,668
Scott: Yeah I mean he went from being basically a bad free-throw shooter to an excellent free-throw shooter with like a ridiculously like I think they said 90-plus percent free-throw shooting.

332
00:22:40,450 --> 00:23:03,510
Scott: Shaquille O'Neal on the other hand You know one of the greatest players ever right sucked at free-throw shooting and was frequently fouled and sent to the free-throw line because sucked at free-throw shooting and he said I'd rather miss him than shoot underhand and look like a you know granny or whatever and He didn't play to win even though he won because he was still so good and playing with good players and good coaches.

333
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:09,390
Scott: But I would say one he Shaquille O'Neal could have won even more if he had swallowed his pride and shot underhand.

334
00:23:09,872 --> 00:23:13,810
Scott: So way to go Onuaku showing people who play to win the game.

335
00:23:14,232 --> 00:23:19,030
Scott: I hope we get some more play to win the game attitude and less worrying about looking cool attitude.

336
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:23,370
Rym: I'm gonna update our winning panel because we got that arm Edwards quote like you play to win the game.

337
00:23:23,834 --> 00:23:25,410
Rym: I'm gonna add a video of the granny free-throw.

338
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:45,310
Scott: Well, cuz see actually the thing is if people use the granny free-throw more right and start getting their free-throw percentages up across the league It could actually change the overall strategy of basketball to where people are actually Much more seriously trying to avoid fouling people which would make the overall game of basketball much much better.

339
00:23:45,551 --> 00:23:52,469
Scott: Yeah, like it wouldn't make it better enough to where I'd like watching it But it would make it still significantly closer to making me want to watch it.

340
00:23:52,791 --> 00:24:02,150
Rym: Well, I mean look at the end result of a football as in soccer You really want to draw a penalty like getting a penalty is the best thing you can do in a soccer game.

341
00:24:02,612 --> 00:24:09,210
Rym: That is more likely to get a goal than anything else you could do including trying to shoot a goal Kick a goal whatever you do to get a goal in the moment.

342
00:24:09,832 --> 00:24:16,597
Rym: You may have noticed that if you go to forum dot front row crew comm the forum is still there But you can't post in it anymore.

343
00:24:16,717 --> 00:24:19,186
Rym: No, and there's two threads at the top forum closed.

344
00:24:19,306 --> 00:24:20,390
Rym: and look ye mighty.

345
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:28,591
Rym: Yeah, we're tired of paying $150 every month for this thing, especially because vanilla not getting better getting actually worse over time Right.

346
00:24:28,652 --> 00:24:35,750
Scott: So what we're gonna do is we're gonna get a backup of it from vanilla and We're gonna load it into the open source version of vanilla.

347
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:41,950
Scott: So it's gonna change how it looks cuz it's gonna go back to the open source way And then we're just gonna leave it that way forever.

348
00:24:42,131 --> 00:24:44,310
Scott: So we don't lose any data because we don't lose data.

349
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:48,910
Scott: We back shit up here also like big really like I and cool cool URLs don't change.

350
00:24:49,191 --> 00:24:52,907
Rym: I really don't want to lose it because you guys have been using this forum for 11 years.

351
00:24:52,947 --> 00:24:58,114
Scott: There's a 11 years of good stuff in there and Content.

352
00:24:58,174 --> 00:24:58,535
Rym: in there.

353
00:24:58,795 --> 00:25:05,070
Rym: you can find threads that were started eight years ago ended six years ago and were resurrected this month

354
00:25:05,271 --> 00:25:17,549
Scott: right, but anyway, uh we started a new forum a community dot front worker comm and Because it's new and fancy people are all excited and posting a lot more than they usually do at least for now.

355
00:25:17,991 --> 00:25:20,198
Rym: Also, all the lurkers came out of the woodwork.

356
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:29,750
Scott: Well the lurkers I realized had to make accounts because Even though they're just reading and not posting they still need to be able to mark stuff like as read.

357
00:25:31,725 --> 00:25:34,750
Rym: So That's why I have that's the main reason I have a FARC account.

358
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:41,374
Rym: I mean, I don't post that off and I very rarely actually post a FARC anymore, but FARC remembers exactly where you read to in every Thread.

359
00:25:41,394 --> 00:25:41,677
Rym: Mm-hmm.

360
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:42,810
Rym: That's real important.

361
00:25:43,031 --> 00:25:51,157
Scott: So if you were ever, you know not joining our forum or not paying attention and we talked about it or anything like that You're pretty much if you're listening to this.

362
00:25:51,638 --> 00:25:56,154
Scott: you should already have an account on this forum our forums Pretty great.

363
00:25:56,275 --> 00:26:01,050
Scott: What you do is every time you sit down at your computer you go to it and you reload it every single time.

364
00:26:01,217 --> 00:26:09,910
Rym: Yep You know hard it is cuz I you know 11 years of typing FR and just hitting enter because every browser ever log into just like goes to farm to forever good icon.

365
00:26:10,532 --> 00:26:13,003
Rym: Real hard to switch that to see ya enter.

366
00:26:13,023 --> 00:26:14,790
Rym: I got muscle memory.

367
00:26:15,011 --> 00:26:17,985
Scott: I have a different methods of browser handling so I don't have that issue.

368
00:26:18,025 --> 00:26:19,010
Rym: I don't use bookmarks.

369
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:20,214
Scott: I don't use bookmarks either.

370
00:26:20,234 --> 00:26:21,639
Scott: I have a bunch of tabs that are there.

371
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:26,832
Rym: Oh, yeah pinned pin tabs all the time Pin tabs forever a hundred years I guess.

372
00:26:26,852 --> 00:26:27,295
Scott: I just go.

373
00:26:27,375 --> 00:26:33,221
Scott: I just go ctrl tab ctrl R ctrl tab ctrl R Move forward reload move next tab reboot next tab reload.

Rym: It's great.

377
00:26:36,354 --> 00:26:38,928
Rym: The rules are simple and they're not like other forums.

378
00:26:38,988 --> 00:26:43,120
Rym: rules And I hope you will appreciate the way our forum functions because it is.

379
00:26:43,141 --> 00:26:48,223
Rym: I think we've done a reasonably good job of making that Community be a kind of community like you.

380
00:26:48,243 --> 00:26:49,350
Rym: look at the penny arcade forums.

381
00:26:50,034 --> 00:26:52,269
Rym: The actual people who do penny arcade ain't posting in there.

382
00:26:52,632 --> 00:26:54,110
Rym: They do occasionally but yeah.

383
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:57,220
Rym: But like that is a you talk about a den of villainy.

384
00:26:57,481 --> 00:27:07,430
Rym: good god those forums our forums are a place I actually go to because I enjoy being there and that is rare among forums about things that have people that run said things.

385
00:27:08,152 --> 00:27:09,697
Rym: We're going to be live at the magfest.

386
00:27:09,717 --> 00:27:12,806
Rym: We were talking about doing well Scott's doing two panels.

387
00:27:13,187 --> 00:27:14,110
Rym: I'm doing six panels.

388
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:16,275
Rym: So GeekNights is doing six panels.

389
00:27:16,756 --> 00:27:18,681
Rym: anime openers around the world quitting?

390
00:27:19,082 --> 00:27:20,465
Rym: when does Sisyphus rage quit?

391
00:27:20,846 --> 00:27:30,441
Rym: the sounds of horror in games and cinema the grind and the virtual mixed and augmented reality panel that actually has a bunch of like Academics on it, you know what the fuck they're talking about.

392
00:27:30,783 --> 00:27:35,077
Rym: and in explain me I was already going for the.

393
00:27:35,579 --> 00:27:40,279
Rym: the inexplicably me is exactly how I'm On the panel.

394
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,470
Rym: you preempted myself deprecation.

395
00:27:42,691 --> 00:27:46,166
Scott: I know you were trying to do some self-deprecation, but instead I grabbed it and made an insult.

396
00:27:46,528 --> 00:27:46,950
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

397
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:49,165
Rym: I am actually eminently qualified to be on that panel.

398
00:27:49,205 --> 00:27:53,476
Rym: Fuck you Sure, but yeah, we're gonna be a magfest.

399
00:27:53,717 --> 00:27:56,205
Rym: our panels are Friday mostly and two on Saturday.

400
00:27:56,225 --> 00:27:57,148
Scott: It's not on Thursday, right?

401
00:27:57,248 --> 00:28:04,670
Rym: No Just don't go on Thursday or Sunday because Sunday is the day where you go and play space war for like three hours.

402
00:28:04,751 --> 00:28:05,217
Rym: Then you go home.

403
00:28:05,481 --> 00:28:06,974
Rym: Mm-hmm So we'll be there.

404
00:28:07,356 --> 00:28:09,285
Rym: also the book club book is Rebecca.

405
00:28:09,365 --> 00:28:15,807
Scott: I'm almost done with it Yeah, so now that once we get the forum thing 100% situated I'm gonna start working on the website then.

406
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:17,849
Rym: Yep We're gonna make like the book clubs.

407
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:22,370
Scott: We're about to find out when Rym post this episode if it posts to the new forum the new thread.

408
00:28:22,511 --> 00:28:23,394
Scott: It's exciting time.

409
00:28:23,434 --> 00:28:24,016
Scott: I tested it.

410
00:28:24,097 --> 00:28:24,759
Scott: It should work.

411
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,289
Rym: Yep, but it's you know, it's the UAT.

412
00:28:27,329 --> 00:28:29,564
Rym: now Yeah, cuz basically I'm the UAT.

413
00:28:29,685 --> 00:28:30,894
Rym: cuz the shit breaks I don't fix it.

414
00:28:30,934 --> 00:28:33,129
Rym: cuz Scott doesn't give me like a route to the back end of the server.

415
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:39,374
Rym: Would you do anyway, I'd go look at while whatever logs I see like what the error was Uh-huh.

416
00:28:39,535 --> 00:28:41,002
Scott: Okay, which log even look at?

417
00:28:41,022 --> 00:28:42,710
Rym: no, so it depends on what the problem like.

418
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:45,887
Rym: So this is the forwarder on the back end is like a MySQL database.

419
00:28:46,148 --> 00:28:51,546
Rym: Yeah Alright does does Django have a log file somewhere where it logs like shit that happened?

420
00:28:51,907 --> 00:28:55,390
Rym: No, not at all Alright, then I look at the MySQL log and see if there was like an insert that failed.

421
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:56,494
Rym: That's like my first go-to.

422
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:56,997
Scott: No.

423
00:28:57,539 --> 00:29:00,290
Rym: Alright, I'd look in the Apache log and see if anything funky happen.

424
00:29:00,812 --> 00:29:04,326
Rym: There's no Apache engine X. Yeah, I'd look at the engine X log then.

425
00:29:04,346 --> 00:29:09,029
Scott: All right If you didn't get a website if you didn't get a 500 error, then that's not gonna be there.

426
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:11,726
Scott: Yeah, usually your problem is episode didn't upload.

427
00:29:11,746 --> 00:29:18,310
Rym: Yep So I guess I'd look in the director where the episode gets uploaded to actually then get its ID threes and shit put on.

428
00:29:18,531 --> 00:29:19,859
Scott: That seems like a good spot to look.

429
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,629
Scott: Yeah, you don't know what to do once you get there.

430
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,779
Rym: Yeah, but I could probably suss it out.

431
00:29:24,483 --> 00:29:25,126
Rym: have my life.

432
00:29:25,146 --> 00:29:26,010
Scott: You know how to use celery.

433
00:29:27,091 --> 00:29:28,240
Rym: That's the test scheduler, right?

434
00:29:28,321 --> 00:29:29,530
Rym: Yeah, I can figure that out.

435
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:32,195
Rym: Celery can't be that hard.

436
00:29:32,235 --> 00:29:35,830
Rym: It's like the baby one that people use in Django, but it's all but it's all stuff.

437
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,759
Scott: The thing is it's not like you're using celery.

438
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:40,424
Scott: It's like you're using code that I wrote.

439
00:29:40,605 --> 00:29:42,310
Scott: that was you know, I'm using.

440
00:29:43,211 --> 00:29:46,570
Rym: It's like celery schedules code you wrote to be run.

441
00:29:48,191 --> 00:29:50,459
Scott: Read the code to figure out what the hell I wrote.

442
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,363
Scott: Is it Python?

443
00:29:51,563 --> 00:29:52,687
Rym: Yeah, I'm not too worried.

444
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:57,847
Rym: I'm just saying I'll tell you what though if I got in there and celery linked to a pearl file.

445
00:29:57,987 --> 00:29:59,294
Rym: I would just quit I would just give up.

446
00:29:59,757 --> 00:30:03,450
Rym: Well, no, I'd look at it first then I'd give up anyway.

447
00:30:04,991 --> 00:30:20,829
Rym: you'd be surprised how many people I interview in the course of just my life over the last decade for like The kind of position that would effectively would be troubleshoot problems on a website like this and the people I interview Can't even begin to figure out how to troubleshoot a system that there isn't documentation for.

448
00:30:22,632 --> 00:30:24,785
Rym: I feel like that's a basic IT skill, but I digress.

449
00:30:25,006 --> 00:30:25,650
Rym: We'll be at MagFest.

450
00:30:25,931 --> 00:30:29,506
Rym: We're gonna be at PAX South doing at least one panel, maybe two panels.

451
00:30:29,566 --> 00:30:31,427
Rym: that's coming up in a few weeks So we'll talk about it later.

452
00:30:32,571 --> 00:30:34,399
Rym: PAX East if you're an enforcer do the thing.

453
00:30:34,419 --> 00:30:38,838
Rym: if you want to be an enforcer Go to the PAX East website.

454
00:30:39,301 --> 00:30:39,964
Rym: open.

455
00:30:40,045 --> 00:30:40,990
Rym: enrollment has begun.

456
00:30:41,071 --> 00:31:03,256
Rym: You can apply to be a PAX enforcer And if you've never done it before and you're passionate about gaming conventions or you're passionate about PAX I recommend trying to do it like at least once like that's a side of PAX that it's real good to see because I've imagined All my life if there were a PAX where everyone who attended it had at some point in their life been an enforcer They'd know the deal.

457
00:31:03,356 --> 00:31:06,029
Rym: It would be like the most chill possible convention you could ever have.

458
00:31:06,814 --> 00:31:08,969
Rym: If more people are enforcers, the world will be a better place.

459
00:31:10,154 --> 00:31:12,132
Rym: so Scott logged in.

460
00:31:12,153 --> 00:31:23,590
Rym: well first he messaged me but I didn't respond to those in the shower for our New Year's party and then we Got over and he went over to my steam, you know, he's steam and he bought a game on my account Which is fine because I kind of expect that to happen and we played this game.

461
00:31:26,312 --> 00:31:26,694
Scott: Just come up.

462
00:31:26,734 --> 00:31:29,889
Scott: whenever I need a game on Steam I should just come over here and say buy his gift.

463
00:31:29,969 --> 00:31:36,941
Rym: I Think I would eventually notice if you're buying gifts, I think that would be.

464
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:39,770
Rym: that would be misappropriation of funds in that case.

465
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:43,350
Rym: But anyway, the game was this little steam game called overcooked.

466
00:31:43,951 --> 00:31:45,078
Rym: I think I've seen it like.

467
00:31:45,098 --> 00:31:46,949
Rym: I think I've seen people linked to her to talk about it.

468
00:31:47,262 --> 00:31:47,720
Scott: Yeah I was just.

469
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:53,333
Scott: you know I was reminded of it for like the second or third time and then it was New Year's and we were coming over and having A bunch of people.

470
00:31:53,353 --> 00:31:54,979
Rym: so I'm like, ah, right this game.

471
00:31:55,019 --> 00:31:56,184
Scott: I remember this game.

472
00:31:56,224 --> 00:31:57,188
Scott: This game was like 20 bucks.

473
00:31:57,791 --> 00:31:58,884
Rym: I thought there's like five bucks.

474
00:32:01,511 --> 00:32:05,166
Rym: But the the gourmet edition - ah, okay, so 20 bucks is for the bundle.

475
00:32:05,206 --> 00:32:06,795
Scott: we like everything, okay Yeah, that's what we got.

476
00:32:06,815 --> 00:32:07,560
Rym: All right, not bad.

477
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,003
Rym: Not bad.

478
00:32:08,547 --> 00:32:20,170
Scott: But anyway See it's overcooked and it's the perfect game for a party because it's a real video game with you know Real-time action and local four-player co-op with four game pads.

479
00:32:20,511 --> 00:32:26,830
Scott: What could be better for your party than such a game on Steam with your HD with your real computer hooked up to your television?

480
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:28,015
Scott: Like a smart person.

481
00:32:28,236 --> 00:32:30,450
Rym: the overall conceit is that?

482
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:34,904
Rym: Cthulhu, which is the flying spaghetti monster finally came to earth.

483
00:32:35,306 --> 00:32:41,740
Rym: It's the end day 1999 it's basically lavos and You want to cook amazing food for it?

484
00:32:42,101 --> 00:32:43,306
Rym: So it will eat you later.

485
00:32:43,326 --> 00:32:46,198
Rym: Mm-hmm And of course you fuck up and bail.

486
00:32:46,258 --> 00:32:47,704
Scott: it is suck at cooking so much.

487
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:48,528
Scott: You can't do it.

488
00:32:48,648 --> 00:32:55,690
Scott: So You know this king onion or whatever his name is sends you back in time to learn how to be chef, right?

489
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:56,433
Scott: It's like well, you can't?

490
00:32:56,553 --> 00:33:00,429
Scott: you have no time to learn how to be chefs now and you're the only ones here.

491
00:33:00,752 --> 00:33:02,769
Scott: So we're gonna send you back in time.

492
00:33:03,555 --> 00:33:11,450
Scott: You can then you know with a time machine Practice your cooking skills and then when the flying spaghetti monster comes again, you'll be so good at cooking.

493
00:33:11,771 --> 00:33:17,770
Scott: You can feed it, you know, say it's desire and the world will not end because it won't be so angry.

494
00:33:17,911 --> 00:33:22,610
Rym: It's got like a top-down map like Lolo three style and like all this business going on.

495
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:24,698
Rym: But the actual game is just.

496
00:33:24,999 --> 00:33:26,123
Rym: it has multiplayer and other stuff.

497
00:33:26,163 --> 00:33:27,810
Rym: but co-op, you know up to four players.

498
00:33:28,412 --> 00:33:37,898
Rym: You have a shared kitchen you walk little guys around and you have got to cook food like get lettuce and Tomatoes and mushrooms.

499
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:44,990
Rym: chop them up and combine them in different Combinations and cook the meat and then make a burger on a bun Deliver it and then get the plates and put them back and wash them, right?

500
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:45,753
Scott: So a lot of ways.

501
00:33:45,793 --> 00:33:49,750
Scott: it's like diner - almost right diner - has like these orders in the top left.

502
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:52,607
Scott: It's like you have to do all the things but diner - you do alone, right?

503
00:33:53,271 --> 00:33:54,778
Scott: And it's just do all the things.

504
00:33:54,819 --> 00:33:59,470
Rym: this is diner - is also much more sort of Iconic and a little more abstracted, right?

505
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:01,056
Scott: This is you have to do all these.

506
00:34:01,518 --> 00:34:04,390
Scott: these are orders in the corner, right more like a board game.

507
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:08,525
Scott: We'll have orders like oh, you know to complete this order and cash it in.

508
00:34:08,606 --> 00:34:12,563
Scott: and traders of genoa You're gonna need you know, two purples and a green right?

509
00:34:12,905 --> 00:34:18,790
Scott: It's like oh to make this burger You're gonna need a bun and a cooked meat, you know and onion and a tomato.

510
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:20,054
Scott: It's like this, you know stuff.

511
00:34:20,074 --> 00:34:23,204
Scott: so and everything has a process and you have four people.

512
00:34:23,244 --> 00:34:24,989
Scott: so like you need a burger.

513
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:32,850
Rym: So someone gets a bun from the supply of infinite buns Someone else gets a meat chops it up takes it over and starts cooking it in a pan, right?

514
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:33,556
Rym: And there's a timer.

515
00:34:33,637 --> 00:34:34,870
Rym: that goes and the pan will be done.

516
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:41,152
Scott: Someone else chops a lettuce and a tomato and puts them in a you know onto the the burger waiting for that meat to come On there.

517
00:34:41,614 --> 00:34:42,558
Rym: how hard could this be?

518
00:34:42,618 --> 00:34:43,964
Scott: you put the whole thing on a plate.

519
00:34:44,225 --> 00:34:45,389
Scott: then it's all done.

520
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:50,710
Scott: You got to put the plate onto the conveyor belt and then the plate comes back dirty.

521
00:34:50,911 --> 00:34:51,956
Scott: You only have a few plates.

522
00:34:52,117 --> 00:34:54,850
Scott: you got to wash them and then someone left something cooked too long.

523
00:34:55,091 --> 00:34:55,955
Scott: It started on fire.

524
00:34:55,975 --> 00:34:59,130
Scott: You got to use a fire extinguisher and there's all these things that can happen.

525
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,360
Scott: Hopefully there won't be any fires.

526
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,347
Scott: you want to worry about that.

527
00:35:01,509 --> 00:35:06,330
Rym: now It starts like all right the kitchen and like just do your thing like it's sort of a fun like semi cooperative.

528
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:15,681
Rym: But just do your thing and it seems easy, but then they throw all the bullshit at you and this game is Super stressful, it's really really difficult.

529
00:35:15,701 --> 00:35:17,045
Scott: It gets really difficult.

530
00:35:17,085 --> 00:35:21,370
Rym: really simple stuff like Like one of them is just the kitchen is in two halves.

531
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:35,992
Rym: so like some of the stuff like you can get vegetables and chop them on the left side and you can cook meat and Serve on the right side, but there's a narrow little hallway between the two And if people are trying to go left and right at the same time You're

532
00:35:36,053 --> 00:35:37,220
Scott: fucked right.

533
00:35:37,281 --> 00:35:44,810
Scott: there are other much more difficult ones Like you're on the deck of a pirate ship and all the tables with all the stuff You're trying to use are sliding all over the place.

534
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:52,190
Rym: You're in a series of three different food trucks that are passing each other with open sides back and forth on the freeway.

535
00:35:53,031 --> 00:35:55,079
Scott: Yeah, it's it's gets pretty ridiculous.

536
00:35:55,099 --> 00:35:56,986
Rym: The kitchen is literally surrounded by lava.

537
00:35:57,006 --> 00:36:07,010
Scott: Yeah So you're trying to cook and complete enough orders in a given time limit and score enough points Under crazier and crazier conditions, right?

538
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:16,299
Scott: So we played through a whole bunch and got really far But we were doing very poorly getting lots of one single stars on levels and God I'm gonna tell you when we played without you the next day.

539
00:36:16,319 --> 00:36:17,665
Rym: We like fucking aced everything.

540
00:36:17,966 --> 00:36:18,870
Scott: Well, you had practice.

541
00:36:19,071 --> 00:36:20,194
Rym: No, we were.

542
00:36:20,214 --> 00:36:25,809
Rym: we were just a better team without you yelling at us to do things the opposite of how we were all doing things.

543
00:36:28,393 --> 00:36:33,049
Scott: But anyway, so the Way to sneeze there.

544
00:36:34,151 --> 00:36:35,516
Scott: Don't sneeze all over that food in the kitchen.

545
00:36:35,536 --> 00:36:36,881
Scott: What kind of chef is that dude?

546
00:36:37,082 --> 00:36:42,789
Rym: So in one of the levels we're like, fuck it We're just like throwing stuff on the ground like leaving out extra plates to be ready.

547
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:47,550
Rym: You know, we play around and if you leave food out rats come and take it away.

548
00:36:47,711 --> 00:36:49,289
Scott: No, the rats are only in this one level.

549
00:36:49,812 --> 00:36:51,901
Scott: That was the rats because each level has a different obstacle.

550
00:36:51,941 --> 00:36:53,990
Scott: that what it was one level where the obstacle was rats.

551
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:54,694
Scott: There are other levels.

552
00:36:55,036 --> 00:36:55,861
Scott: There weren't any rats.

553
00:36:55,941 --> 00:36:56,927
Scott: You can just throw food on the ground.

554
00:36:56,967 --> 00:36:57,450
Scott: No one cares.

555
00:36:57,791 --> 00:37:01,325
Rym: I threw a lot of cooked hamburger on the ground and just left it there until the time was.

556
00:37:01,345 --> 00:37:04,765
Scott: the point is after playing and Getting as deep as we could before it said, uh-huh.

557
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:07,050
Scott: You suck too much But you're not gonna let you play more levels.

558
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:07,933
Scott: Do you get more stars?

559
00:37:07,973 --> 00:37:12,310
Scott: you went back to try to get three stars some easy levels because their skills had gone up and we?

560
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:15,202
Scott: Got in the zone in those easy levels and it was like whoa.

561
00:37:15,263 --> 00:37:16,810
Scott: Yeah, this is so good.

562
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:29,990
Rym: this game has a an excellent arc of like auto wear and stressed out and overwhelmed and then you move into like basic competency and then you move into like Ultimate flow like when you get flow going in this game.

563
00:37:30,472 --> 00:37:34,650
Rym: It's like doing a nine photo in DDR like your brain just feels like it's in this slot, right?

564
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:37,921
Scott: but when we got we only got the flow going on like easy levels.

565
00:37:37,981 --> 00:37:44,510
Scott: if we got the flow going and like really difficult levels That would be like like a peak gaming kind of experience.

566
00:37:44,671 --> 00:37:49,750
Rym: The next day when you weren't here We got a burger plate like we got a burger one like you know.

567
00:37:49,891 --> 00:37:51,378
Rym: So the stuff to back up a little bit.

568
00:37:51,398 --> 00:37:52,704
Rym: the way it works is the three stars.

569
00:37:52,724 --> 00:37:54,313
Rym: in every level like in those kinds of games.

570
00:37:54,374 --> 00:38:00,006
Rym: but generally like Star one is like get ten points like you you've made one.

571
00:38:00,467 --> 00:38:01,170
Rym: get two stars.

572
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:04,207
Rym: It's like get 80 points like you were reasonably efficient.

573
00:38:04,227 --> 00:38:06,420
Scott: three stars Yeah, 400 fuck you.

574
00:38:08,392 --> 00:38:15,052
Rym: We got to the point to where we crushed the three stars on some of these like we went way beyond what we need to go Beyond.

575
00:38:15,675 --> 00:38:17,121
Rym: but even then it wasn't the crazy hard ones.

576
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:19,270
Rym: It was like making complicated burgers.

577
00:38:19,411 --> 00:38:22,002
Rym: It wasn't like make complicated burgers on the pirate ship.

578
00:38:22,042 --> 00:38:22,645
Rym: that's on fire.

579
00:38:22,665 --> 00:38:25,557
Scott: Yeah, yeah As I mean we didn't.

580
00:38:25,698 --> 00:38:26,241
Scott: there's a lot.

581
00:38:26,261 --> 00:38:33,310
Scott: there's a lot of levels in this game Especially be at expansions like it seems to have a lot of levels in it like, you know We don't even think we've seen half the game But it

582
00:38:33,351 --> 00:38:43,638
Rym: does a really good job of giving you like three different goals to shoot for that really fit into those levels of overwhelmed Like adequate apprentice level skill.

583
00:38:43,959 --> 00:38:46,670
Rym: and then the third star is you are now an expert.

584
00:38:46,972 --> 00:38:47,455
Scott: Yeah, we all.

585
00:38:47,495 --> 00:38:49,669
Scott: there's a versus mode which I think is two on two.

586
00:38:50,252 --> 00:38:52,523
Scott: We tried that but we're only one-on-one.

587
00:38:52,563 --> 00:38:53,930
Scott: we didn't get it set up right or whatever.

588
00:38:54,151 --> 00:38:59,034
Scott: So our other do just stood there are they just stood there, but the versus mode is okay, I guess It's pretty fun.

589
00:38:59,135 --> 00:39:02,130
Scott: If you really want to do some verses instead of cop is basically the same thing.

590
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:04,030
Scott: Oh, you know, it's two little identical kitchens.

591
00:39:04,261 --> 00:39:05,494
Scott: Yeah And you have the same orders.

592
00:39:05,514 --> 00:39:08,806
Scott: who does it better and who can get more stars within a time limit?

593
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,131
Scott: and that's a perfectly fine Game.

594
00:39:10,152 --> 00:39:12,726
Scott: you want to see who's better at doing the cooking game by.

595
00:39:12,886 --> 00:39:15,420
Rym: so I mean I don't want to say that much else about it.

596
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,290
Scott: cuz the game is there isn't that much else about it.

597
00:39:17,551 --> 00:39:18,635
Scott: That's why it's so great.

598
00:39:19,016 --> 00:39:19,538
Rym: one flaw.

599
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:22,550
Scott: there is one major floss soul flaw in this game.

600
00:39:23,193 --> 00:39:26,390
Rym: Is that the analog stick to move your guy around is?

601
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:38,030
Rym: Super analog and super floaty, but you need to precisely select Discrete squares in the game like pick up this tomato not that tomato, right?

602
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:47,662
Scott: There are a lot of times where I'd like try to put a tomato on the cutting board and it would just go like Whoop and I put the tomato next to the cutting board To pick it up again and put it back and it's through cooked

603
00:39:47,702 --> 00:39:49,690
Rym: food in the garbage like four times.

604
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:55,390
Scott: It's because the analog stick and the controls are just a little bit flaky and not precise enough and there's no reason for that.

605
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:59,010
Scott: You know, everything's big enough in the game that like aiming at a single square shouldn't be difficult.

606
00:39:59,171 --> 00:40:02,650
Scott: I would have made maybe turn the sensitivity down.

607
00:40:03,272 --> 00:40:09,395
Rym: I mean the way I would have polished this is I would have made the characters still be floaty because the floaty of walking around Is actually good.

608
00:40:09,415 --> 00:40:12,305
Scott: You could have also done twin stick using the right stick to aim.

609
00:40:12,566 --> 00:40:13,530
Rym: I know this is much simpler way.

610
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:16,090
Rym: So leave them floaty because the characters have big hitboxes.

611
00:40:16,572 --> 00:40:21,359
Rym: I wouldn't make it like grid because that would remove some of that like panicky ad hoc movement Mmm.

612
00:40:21,951 --> 00:40:28,558
Rym: and when they're floaty like you'll try to pass people in a narrow ish hallway and you like bump into each other and then you Sort it out, but it slows you down a little bit.

613
00:40:28,579 --> 00:40:30,670
Rym: Like it's one of those things you can improve for efficiency.

614
00:40:30,771 --> 00:40:31,174
Rym: I like that.

615
00:40:31,214 --> 00:40:33,189
Rym: It's like getting the sparks in Pac-Man say edx

616
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:33,771
Scott: Mm-hmm,

617
00:40:34,112 --> 00:40:44,206
Rym: but I would have made it so that the if you're clear if you're near one of these squares You can work with because it's a grid on all the countertops and all the things you can interact

618
00:40:44,246 --> 00:40:45,050
Scott: with it locks in.

619
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:54,376
Rym: I would have made those 100% lock-in if you're next to what if you actually do want to put the chopped tomato next to the kind of walk a little More to the left.

620
00:40:54,699 --> 00:40:54,840
Rym: Mmm.

621
00:40:55,122 --> 00:40:55,909
Rym: That's what I would have done.

622
00:40:56,213 --> 00:40:57,310
Scott: You could you know, you just have it.

623
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:59,140
Scott: You could have had done that as long as you.

624
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,010
Scott: just I don't think you do absolute lock-in.

625
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:01,495
Scott: I think we do.

626
00:41:01,515 --> 00:41:02,910
Scott: is you have a sensible radius?

627
00:41:03,253 --> 00:41:10,454
Rym: Yeah around a you know Like a stove or maybe like if you jam the analog stick like way at an angle It'll target the next one.

628
00:41:10,494 --> 00:41:15,570
Rym: But like the towel like is a wider band of lock-in on the one you're you're most overlapping with.

629
00:41:15,942 --> 00:41:16,916
Scott: Yeah it should be.

630
00:41:16,936 --> 00:41:28,207
Scott: it should be much more difficult to Accidentally put your tomato on the floor as opposed to the cutting board because that wasn't flying next to the cutting board And even when we had flow we still kept fucking that up like that was.

631
00:41:28,327 --> 00:41:29,757
Rym: that was a yeah We just yes problem.

632
00:41:29,777 --> 00:41:34,290
Scott: We would just get better at correcting ourselves Like I'd put the thing down by accident pick it up and put it in the right place again.

633
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:35,616
Scott: But it was I think our friends cuz.

634
00:41:35,836 --> 00:41:37,825
Rym: so this game isn't just for a player like you.

635
00:41:37,845 --> 00:41:38,930
Rym: play with four people and it works.

636
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:44,450
Rym: Great, and even you can split controllers up so that if you only own two controllers I think you can still do four player.

637
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:47,203
Scott: Yeah, because each half of a controller has a stick and a button.

638
00:41:47,323 --> 00:41:48,730
Scott: all you need to play is a stick and a button.

639
00:41:49,092 --> 00:41:50,401
Scott: See one Xbox two buttons.

640
00:41:51,085 --> 00:41:53,930
Scott: sure two buttons But the point is every controller has a stick and two buttons.

641
00:41:53,930 --> 00:42:05,290
Rym: But this game is legit more multiplayer much like the jackbox games because one of our friends was Calling out orders as a spectator and that was actually super fun.

642
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:09,610
Rym: Like you might argue that's cheating and I thought I don't care but we had a lot of fun with that.

643
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:12,520
Scott: So people it was because when you're all working you're.

644
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,170
Scott: it's like you need all four people to be concentrating on what to do.

645
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:19,190
Scott: It's hard to also pay attention to what the orders are, right?

646
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:20,681
Scott: So someone to tell that to you with it.

647
00:42:20,721 --> 00:42:27,029
Scott: cuz like every time you look at that You're not looking at the guy you're moving, you know, this is fundamentally a game about making efficient systems.

648
00:42:27,571 --> 00:42:44,923
Rym: I will identifying how to make a system efficient increasingly identifying the next bottleneck as you eliminate bottlenecks and simultaneously Developing a tactical ability to when your plan gets fucked up by something unexpected Deviate from the plan while maintaining a reasonable degree of efficiency, right?

649
00:42:44,943 --> 00:42:45,966
Scott: And there's a lot you might think.

650
00:42:46,067 --> 00:42:46,950
Scott: Oh, this is really simple.

651
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:56,098
Scott: It's like you do the or the ingredient getting in the chopping you do the cooking you do the plating you do the dishes And then what you know, that's great.

652
00:42:56,158 --> 00:42:58,730
Rym: But now there's a bun shortage or we're out of clean plates.

653
00:42:58,992 --> 00:43:00,670
Scott: Well, there's no bun shortages infinite buns.

654
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:01,895
Scott: But the point is there's a bunch.

655
00:43:01,955 --> 00:43:05,710
Rym: there's a shortage of buns out on the right side where we're actually preparing the food, right?

656
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:08,380
Scott: That is so a good example.

657
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,990
Scott: is the one level that really bothered us was the one where?

658
00:43:11,991 --> 00:43:13,784
Scott: The cutting boards would slide in the pile.

659
00:43:13,825 --> 00:43:15,996
Rym: Oh my god That one.

660
00:43:16,036 --> 00:43:17,923
Scott: so only at the beginning of the level.

661
00:43:18,465 --> 00:43:24,590
Scott: the cutting boards are on the left So only the people on the left side of the screen can chop anything and then it slides.

662
00:43:24,791 --> 00:43:30,271
Scott: Now only the two players on the right side of the screen can chop anything because the cutting boards have moved with everything that was on them.

663
00:43:30,291 --> 00:43:31,214
Scott: they just slid away.

664
00:43:31,234 --> 00:43:32,679
Scott: so you have to constantly.

665
00:43:32,699 --> 00:43:37,561
Scott: you have to basically have two different modes of what you're doing and You have to win when the deck slides.

666
00:43:37,601 --> 00:43:40,254
Scott: you have to change modes and be like, okay These are my tasks now.

667
00:43:40,756 --> 00:43:45,170
Scott: and you also to pick up like the task that the other players just left off that what they were Like.

668
00:43:45,211 --> 00:43:45,994
Scott: what were they doing?

669
00:43:46,014 --> 00:43:52,430
Scott: I need to do the task that they he was doing but much like in say Oh where he left off or counter-strike?

670
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:53,713
Rym: You'll have your blood.

671
00:43:53,753 --> 00:43:56,182
Rym: default operating orders like your plan like.

672
00:43:56,202 --> 00:44:01,850
Rym: you'll come up with a strategy and follow that strategy But you have to like to get high level like ultra high level play.

673
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:12,490
Rym: You have to have the ability to deviate from that strategy in a way that other players will deviate in a way that together You'll maintain efficiency without having to stop and say here's the new plan.

674
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:14,438
Scott: It's the ultimate real co-op like.

675
00:44:14,498 --> 00:44:17,008
Scott: it's the most real video game co-op there is.

676
00:44:17,028 --> 00:44:17,269
Scott: it is.

677
00:44:17,691 --> 00:44:19,800
Rym: This game is great and you should buy.

678
00:44:19,821 --> 00:44:29,970
Scott: in terms of the real time Yeah, if you have four if you're in a college or if you have a lot of parties or conventions Your laptop to conventions and plug it into the TV in the hotel room.

679
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:31,735
Rym: This is like a must own right.

680
00:44:31,876 --> 00:44:43,224
Scott: if you have frequently or semi frequently at least four people in the same place with a computer connected to a television or a big enough screen and enough game pads then you must buy this game.

681
00:44:43,244 --> 00:44:52,840
Scott: if You're just like a solo person or you don't have a lot of friends or you're sad or you don't have a computer connected There is like single.

682
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,690
Scott: you can just play this with other people who bought it already.

683
00:44:55,931 --> 00:45:02,495
Scott: When they bring their setup or you go to their house or something, right, you know But if you're the party house, you gotta have overcooked in that party.

684
00:45:08,265 --> 00:45:10,810
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

685
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:15,610
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

686
00:45:15,911 --> 00:45:17,898
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at front row.

687
00:45:17,938 --> 00:45:20,930
Scott: crew calm for show notes discussion news and more.

688
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:28,610
Rym: Remember GeekNights is not one but four different shows sci-tech Mondays gaming Tuesdays anime comic Wednesdays and indiscriminate Thursdays.

00:45:33,392 --> 00:45:39,612
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience, but unlike those other late shows It's actually recorded at night.

691
00:45:50,266 --> 00:45:56,824
Rym: and the patreon patrons in order the modern money they give us on a continuing basis are Alan Joyce Rebecca Dunn Nicholas Brando hiding Nickle Amanda to shit.

692
00:45:56,865 --> 00:45:58,090
Rym: construction noises Ivy fame.

693
00:45:58,190 --> 00:45:58,892
Rym: I stated calm.

694
00:45:58,932 --> 00:46:04,687
Rym: William Eisenberg's Jeremy minor Chris Reimer and Thomas on Bertie would have won Christian coons word.

695
00:46:04,967 --> 00:46:06,010
Rym: order doesn't matter.

696
00:46:06,111 --> 00:46:09,895
Rym: It's only important that the first and last Sure, man.

697
00:46:09,915 --> 00:46:13,170
Rym: Holy kid Rilla Val James David White Rochelle, Monta, Nona superboy.

698
00:46:13,491 --> 00:46:15,958
Rym: And then the wing hussars arrived earned serious.

699
00:46:15,998 --> 00:46:17,301
Rym: Brian Fisher sailor Vista.

700
00:46:17,402 --> 00:46:28,143
Rym: my decision to lower my pledge has nothing to do with Scott Matthew Smith Don Schleich jar Thomas and Joe sure Joe star Tyler Ella shot saw Sean Yeager Sam Cordery Clinton Walton run from New Zealand.

701
00:46:28,183 --> 00:46:29,368
Rym: Ryan parent drew open letter.

702
00:46:29,388 --> 00:46:37,187
Rym: Brian Sidroni Curian if Redacted Chris mid give Chris Knox Daniel Redmond Shawn Klein Chris Reimer and Thomas Hahn.

703
00:46:37,608 --> 00:46:41,924
Rym: true to my word I do one take every time and I read the whole thing in one go.

704
00:46:41,944 --> 00:47:03,842
Rym: if you guys trip me up you trip me up, but yeah, we're back at least for magfest then we're not doing any more shows this week obviously and Then we'll get interrupted again by packs house in a ski trip, but we'll be Mostly on track to do normal GeekNights and ramp back up to a normal schedule in the coming months as we typically do At the beginning of the new year, so we'll see you at magfest.

705
00:47:03,902 --> 00:47:07,552
Rym: and now I leave you with Replicating eating up memory.

706
00:47:07,753 --> 00:47:08,194
Rym: What do I do?

707
00:47:08,574 --> 00:47:09,857
Rym: type cookie you idiot?

708
00:47:10,358 --> 00:47:11,320
Rym: I'll head him off at the pass.

709
00:47:16,101 --> 00:47:18,651
Rym: Yeah, but you're a bug attacking all login and overly files.

710
00:47:18,692 --> 00:47:19,515
Rym: run antivirus.

711
00:47:19,575 --> 00:47:20,720
Rym: Give me a systems display.

712
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:29,851
Rym: Die dickweeds.

713
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:35,408
Rym: a Rabbit is in the administration system.

714
00:47:35,509 --> 00:47:36,293
Rym: send a flu shot.

715
00:47:36,474 --> 00:47:37,540
Rym: rabbit flu shot.

716
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:38,723
Rym: Someone talk to me.

717
00:47:38,743 --> 00:47:44,079
Rym: a rabbit replicates till it overloads a file that it spreads like cancer cancer.

718
00:48:01,655 --> 00:48:02,321
Rym: Oh, it's the Gibson.

719
00:48:02,361 --> 00:48:03,389
Rym: it's finding us too fast.
