1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,621
Rym: it's Tuesday April 11th 2017.

2
00:00:12,621 --> 00:00:16,390
Rym: I'm Rym I'm smarter than Rym and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:21,357
Rym: tonight we are talking about the Legend of Zelda breath of the wild.

4
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:23,961
Scott: am I the wild?

5
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:26,045
Rym: I breathe I'm just the breath.

6
00:00:26,766 --> 00:00:27,828
Rym: let's do this.

7
00:00:30,132 --> 00:00:32,616
Rym: it's a warm today.

8
00:00:32,637 --> 00:00:35,184
Rym: I rode my bike to work today.

9
00:00:35,486 --> 00:00:39,964
Scott: my life has been restored like I was down to half a heart but now I got extra hard.

10
00:00:40,044 --> 00:00:41,851
Rym: yep I just had this feeling all day.

11
00:00:41,871 --> 00:00:42,774
Rym: it was like 77 degrees.

12
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:54,343
Scott: I went out for lunch I rode my bike I ate lunch in the office way quick and then I walked over to the grassy river area and I just laid in the grass for as long as I could get away with.

13
00:00:54,403 --> 00:00:58,599
Rym: yep though I did on my way home and I will not tell.

14
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:05,532
Rym: my goal for this entire summer is to not once tell yet another story of some fixie guy fucking up or getting in my way.

15
00:01:05,652 --> 00:01:08,586
Scott: but yet well you can just say there was a fixie guy fucking up today.

16
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:10,594
Rym: yeah but this unless it tops this one.

17
00:01:10,614 --> 00:01:14,247
Rym: so the EMTs were at the base.

18
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:18,725
Rym: you know the the Queensborough the Williamsburg Bridge on the approach into Brooklyn.

19
00:01:19,006 --> 00:01:22,964
Rym: okay on that long downhill mm-hmm there were a bunch of EMTs.

20
00:01:23,145 --> 00:01:23,971
Scott: someone fell and hurt them.

21
00:01:24,011 --> 00:01:25,663
Rym: so someone had a pretty serious bike accident.

22
00:01:25,683 --> 00:01:34,045
Rym: they were putting them into a stretcher and there's a whole crowd of people around and I see a fixie bike and it looks damaged mm-hmm it hit somebody or just himself.

23
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:35,775
Rym: only one person appeared to be injured.

24
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:37,605
Scott: all right was it the cyclist or another person?

25
00:01:37,726 --> 00:01:41,525
Rym: it was the cyclist I assume mm-hmm because it looked like.

26
00:01:41,605 --> 00:01:42,471
Rym: I mean I just biked by.

27
00:01:42,511 --> 00:01:44,242
Rym: I wasn't gonna gawk at someone with their injury.

28
00:01:44,282 --> 00:01:48,083
Scott: but yeah I do not rubberneck based on the position I don't want to see the injury.

29
00:01:48,103 --> 00:01:51,682
Rym: I'll probably bar based on the position of some bloody bandages and such.

30
00:01:51,983 --> 00:01:56,739
Rym: it looked like the back of the dudes left or right like that.

31
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:01,773
Rym: basically suppose that your pedals hit the back of your leg mm-hmm.

32
00:02:02,074 --> 00:02:05,889
Rym: that area was injured in pretty serious looking fashion.

33
00:02:05,949 --> 00:02:12,373
Scott: if they weren't fixed to the rear wheel maybe they would stop spinning and not whack the back of your leg.

34
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:21,215
Rym: so my my suspicion is that someone did that thing that fixie bike riders like to do where when they're going downhill you know human can pedal that fast.

35
00:02:21,537 --> 00:02:32,257
Scott: they pull their legs up and let the pedals just go away and then they should have done what the person did in my thing of the day for Thursday then it would work.

36
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:37,887
Rym: the problem is at the base of that bridge there's those two big poles to prevent cars from driving in the bike area.

37
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:38,491
Scott: that is correct.

38
00:02:38,632 --> 00:02:41,993
Rym: so you've got to be able to maneuver around those things if you're going real fast.

39
00:02:42,033 --> 00:02:46,162
Rym: it's not like you can just turn a bike on a dime especially if your feet are not on the pedals.

40
00:02:46,604 --> 00:02:51,230
Scott: yeah apparently I heard a story cops were ticketing people for not walking their bikes over the RFK bridge.

41
00:02:51,331 --> 00:02:52,276
Scott: what it's like?

42
00:02:52,336 --> 00:02:54,087
Scott: why don't you take it these fucking fixie guys?

43
00:02:54,127 --> 00:02:54,670
Scott: instead?

44
00:02:54,731 --> 00:02:56,079
Scott: it's like your law I think pretty sure.

45
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:03,196
Scott: the law says you have to have brakes on your bike yep or lights like if they take it for those things I would not care as much about.

46
00:03:03,217 --> 00:03:08,285
Scott: you know because all the cyclists are pretty much like whenever cops ticket cyclists they're like why are you doing this?

47
00:03:08,305 --> 00:03:11,124
Scott: you shouldn't be doing this at all even though we are breaking laws.

48
00:03:11,185 --> 00:03:13,475
Scott: technically because you should be harassing drivers.

49
00:03:13,496 --> 00:03:16,710
Scott: drivers amazing because drivers are murdering people.

50
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,895
Scott: right and you know.

51
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:25,394
Scott: obviously there's some truth to that but at the same time it's like well you are still violating laws so it's not really that don't do that but

52
00:03:25,454 --> 00:03:27,082
Rym: it's mostly dumb laws because there's

53
00:03:27,102 --> 00:03:30,362
Scott: some of the law that the RFK one is kind of dumb but like the RFK

54
00:03:30,422 --> 00:03:34,305
Rym: one is extra dumb because that bridge is so long that walking over it is ridiculous.

55
00:03:34,606 --> 00:03:36,917
Scott: oh well you know I wonder why that rule exists.

56
00:03:36,957 --> 00:03:37,902
Scott: it is not wide enough.

57
00:03:37,942 --> 00:03:40,699
Scott: because no it's because there's one part where there's no fence.

58
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:47,703
Rym: I'm actually afraid of some fight between the Port Authority and the MTA and a couple other.

59
00:03:47,783 --> 00:03:50,498
Rym: like basically there's all these arguments out jurisdictions.

60
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:57,312
Rym: so bridges that are under certain people's jurisdictions just bike all you want and bridges that are other people's jurisdictions.

61
00:03:57,353 --> 00:04:01,857
Rym: they hate bikes and there's this weird like internal New York City politics thing going on.

62
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:02,520
Scott: anyway.

63
00:04:03,861 --> 00:04:18,786
Scott: the point is that they should go after people who if you want to take a cyclist ticket them for something that's actually bad like not having lights at night or not having brakes on your bike or actually just like running a red light in front of actual traffic.

64
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,957
Scott: yeah not a red light at like.

65
00:04:20,997 --> 00:04:24,958
Scott: the thing is they do take it for red lights a lot and that's what cycles doing now.

66
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:27,288
Scott: take it like T sections.

67
00:04:27,348 --> 00:04:36,682
Rym: yeah they're going like on the right side of the road getting a ticket on a T where the part of the T that cost that for the light goes into a brick wall.

68
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:37,726
Rym: yep yep.

69
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:42,844
Rym: so what they're doing lately is though they won't pull people over right away.

70
00:04:42,864 --> 00:04:45,719
Rym: I saw a whole bunch of reports of this on a couple of red.

71
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:46,523
Rym: it's just recently.

72
00:04:46,563 --> 00:04:51,664
Rym: follow you a bunch of 20 red lights because technically they're traffic tickets.

73
00:04:52,227 --> 00:04:59,662
Rym: so they follow all the same rules as cars meaning each subsequent offense of the same type in a certain period adds like a multiplier to your fine.

74
00:05:00,044 --> 00:05:07,683
Rym: so this guy got basically a six thousand dollar ticket for running a stop sign because he ran ten stop signs in the middle of the night on an abandoned road.

75
00:05:07,944 --> 00:05:10,936
Rym: yep so I yeah but I won't complain about.

76
00:05:10,976 --> 00:05:15,079
Scott: I'm sure there weren't any cars doing any really dangerous things at that time.

77
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:16,521
Rym: yep.

78
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:26,651
Rym: so it's gaming day and the most important game right now is NHL hockey because hockey playoffs start tomorrow.

79
00:05:28,156 --> 00:05:31,330
Scott: it's gonna be some good stuff even if you didn't pay attention to hockey all year.

80
00:05:31,351 --> 00:05:34,263
Scott: or you don't care about hockey everyone.

81
00:05:34,304 --> 00:05:39,069
Scott: the hockey games tomorrow are gonna be nothing like the hockey games that you have seen the rest of the year.

82
00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:41,785
Rym: regular hockey is like oh someone wins someone loses.

83
00:05:41,866 --> 00:05:42,891
Rym: maybe there's a rivalry.

84
00:05:42,952 --> 00:05:43,998
Scott: are we making the playoffs?

85
00:05:44,018 --> 00:05:44,420
Scott: are we not?

86
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,103
Scott: okay we're in.

87
00:05:45,123 --> 00:05:45,906
Scott: we don't really care.

88
00:05:46,328 --> 00:06:01,385
Scott: once it's playoff hockey everyone tries super hard and everyone is super serious and if there's a tie they don't just do a shootout they just keep playing literally forever until someone wins for real wins not you that win.

89
00:06:01,426 --> 00:06:11,790
Scott: you have to win in a regular old hockey golden goal and they just keep going mm-hmm and so start watching tomorrow and even if you know nothing it will be excitement.

90
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:12,957
Rym: there's also a dynamic watch.

91
00:06:13,058 --> 00:06:15,452
Scott: any team you want cuz it's not just don't root for anything.

92
00:06:15,472 --> 00:06:27,036
Rym: normally in any sport during the regular season you play a bunch of different teams never play the same team twice in a row mm-hmm and you only usually play teams that are in your area and you occasionally play teams that are further away.

93
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:40,143
Rym: if you do it all in hockey with the finals you basically play against the same team up to seven games and you start like learning from each other and adapting to each other in a way that I

94
00:06:40,163 --> 00:06:45,265
Scott: find the goalies weakness weak point and I'm at it like it's a red spot on some boss.

95
00:06:45,285 --> 00:06:47,233
Rym: yeah it's good stuff.

96
00:06:47,755 --> 00:06:51,571
Rym: so you got any gaming news other than the fact that the most important sport is happening right now.

97
00:06:51,591 --> 00:06:58,204
Scott: so mad cats is a company that for most of my life I associated them with shitty third-party controllers.

98
00:06:58,245 --> 00:06:58,990
Scott: cuz that's what they made.

99
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:01,083
Scott: they made really stupid third-party controllers you'd go to.

100
00:07:01,103 --> 00:07:01,725
Scott: so anything is.

101
00:07:02,067 --> 00:07:08,652
Scott: in my life I have never bought a third party garbage controller right ever.

102
00:07:08,752 --> 00:07:11,845
Scott: I've bought third-party controllers but never bad ones.

103
00:07:12,066 --> 00:07:16,344
Scott: only what an occasion when they happen to be a really high quality one was rare.

104
00:07:16,424 --> 00:07:21,663
Scott: I have mostly like 90% bought first party quality controllers.

105
00:07:21,783 --> 00:07:26,559
Rym: I bought one logitech gamepad once at RIT and I mean shit.

106
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,864
Scott: I bought gravis gamepad.

107
00:07:28,025 --> 00:07:29,290
Scott: the real deal.

108
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,117
Rym: even gravis gamepads though not great.

109
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,977
Scott: that was the best you can get in those days yeah but not great for a PC.

110
00:07:35,018 --> 00:07:37,349
Scott: that was a first-party controller for a DOS PC.

111
00:07:37,631 --> 00:07:39,299
Scott: the gravis gamepad was the first party.

112
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:40,002
Scott: can gamepad?

113
00:07:40,203 --> 00:07:41,368
Rym: I'll give you that anyway.

114
00:07:41,609 --> 00:07:46,293
Scott: the point is and mad cats was like the worst at making third-party controllers.

115
00:07:46,313 --> 00:07:49,971
Scott: they had ones that were had like weird shapes and crazy were not good to use.

116
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,060
Scott: they were bad in every conceivable way.

117
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,167
Scott: they were cheap and flimsy.

118
00:07:53,489 --> 00:07:59,039
Scott: but like I'd go to other people's houses even people had more money than me right and they would have third-party controllers.

119
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,893
Scott: I guess they bought them because they were cheaper.

120
00:08:00,933 --> 00:08:05,356
Scott: or they thought they were cooler looking or they didn't know better and it's like oh my god.

121
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:20,211
Scott: and of course you know the worst was when it was someone they thought they were led a Nintendo console and this kid he bought he chose to buy this third-party mad cat's n64 controller for it so you get a four for golden eye right.

122
00:08:20,492 --> 00:08:26,677
Scott: it's like if he chose this one and liked it that he chose it over getting a regular Nintendo one.

123
00:08:26,697 --> 00:08:31,384
Scott: why does he insist on using the regular Nintendo one in his house and make you use the mad cats?

124
00:08:31,404 --> 00:08:33,977
Rym: because he realized he made a terrible mistake.

125
00:08:33,996 --> 00:08:40,822
Rym: that in public no so but then they had kind of a renaissance and that they you know they have.

126
00:08:40,922 --> 00:08:50,119
Rym: once rock band the first rock band came out and guitar hero those games sort of brought back the weird controller era for a while right.

127
00:08:50,139 --> 00:08:58,535
Scott: there seemed to be something happened you know some years ago where mad cats someone took it over or something they started actually making like.

128
00:08:58,556 --> 00:09:01,669
Rym: they say like the to their loyal customers.

129
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:05,424
Rym: they were like super open and really helpful good customer service.

130
00:09:05,464 --> 00:09:13,642
Scott: they suddenly like something changed and they became like they had it factories or they could make controllers apparently right and they turn.

131
00:09:13,662 --> 00:09:15,133
Rym: I don't know if they met him directly or if they.

132
00:09:15,294 --> 00:09:29,638
Scott: the point is they had the capability of designing and building game controllers and they used it to make good controllers at some point and they became like a really cool company that made good stuff including like fight sticks especially.

133
00:09:29,659 --> 00:09:30,502
Scott: I have a mad cat's.

134
00:09:30,824 --> 00:09:32,874
Rym: I also have a mad cat's fight like a Street Fighter.

135
00:09:32,934 --> 00:09:39,449
Rym: for Super Street Fighter 4 fights they came with a keychain that also looks like the fight stick that has the Allen wrench.

136
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:42,447
Rym: I need to open my fight stick because I can modify my fight stick.

137
00:09:42,467 --> 00:09:42,910
Scott: yeah it's like.

138
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:49,947
Scott: it's like that's way cool and it also happens to be a really good fight stick with like real buttons real stick a square gate not no bullshit.

139
00:09:50,249 --> 00:09:54,870
Scott: you know like angle gate that they use in the US you can replace the gate if you want.

140
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:55,673
Scott: sure it's like.

141
00:09:55,734 --> 00:09:57,100
Scott: it's like pretty awesome.

142
00:09:57,743 --> 00:10:09,132
Rym: so mad cats turn their ship around but now well unfortunately by turning their ship around they turned it into the rock band for ship right early rock band for had to go crazy nuts or they were done.

143
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:10,357
Scott: so now they're done.

144
00:10:10,417 --> 00:10:11,381
Scott: mad dots is going out.

145
00:10:11,522 --> 00:10:18,389
Rym: oh business if you notice at the PAX is like seeing who is spending money at PAX especially in like.

146
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:25,604
Rym: the more social gaming scene is actually a pretty good indicator of who's doing well because for a long time it was like the rock band stage.

147
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,878
Rym: everywhere you'd see rock band type just like on a stage.

148
00:10:29,059 --> 00:10:39,582
Rym: there'd be like five of them and then right before mad cats went under suddenly it was all jackbox instead and all the fake instrument games kind of fell by the wayside.

149
00:10:39,622 --> 00:10:41,511
Scott: right the fake instrument games went away.

150
00:10:41,531 --> 00:10:44,445
Rym: just dance kind of replaced them but not enough right.

151
00:10:44,506 --> 00:10:46,757
Scott: and then they tried to bring him back.

152
00:10:46,898 --> 00:10:49,772
Scott: they like they put in an effort like all right we let him go.

153
00:10:49,792 --> 00:10:50,415
Scott: it was.

154
00:10:50,455 --> 00:10:51,882
Scott: you know it was hot for a while.

155
00:10:51,922 --> 00:10:53,007
Scott: people have cooled off.

156
00:10:53,047 --> 00:10:55,338
Scott: we'll wait and then we'll bring them back.

157
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:57,508
Scott: but the bringing them back did not work.

158
00:10:57,749 --> 00:10:59,658
Scott: oh it did not failed at the bring back.

159
00:10:59,939 --> 00:11:01,026
Scott: they didn't wait long enough.

160
00:11:01,046 --> 00:11:01,690
Scott: they were too.

161
00:11:01,991 --> 00:11:04,988
Scott: you know they needed that Monet's and they went and they gambled too soon.

162
00:11:05,008 --> 00:11:05,088
Scott: yeah.

163
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:11,617
Rym: and meanwhile those like the replacement in that sector now really seems to be those just dance style games.

164
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:23,391
Rym: but I've noticed that they have a higher social barrier to entry and that people who are totally fine playing a fake guitar on stage totally not fine having to freeform dance in front of a screen.

165
00:11:23,411 --> 00:11:28,538
Rym: so you've got kind of a different demographic playing those games when there is a stage at a convention.

166
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:30,528
Scott: I'm telling you DDR the window is open.

167
00:11:30,568 --> 00:11:35,273
Rym: now's the time DDR could come back in a big way and that's not just because we're DDR nuts.

168
00:11:35,313 --> 00:11:38,813
Scott: I really do think they've waited long enough on DDR that they could bring it back now.

169
00:11:38,873 --> 00:11:44,724
Scott: I mean as far as I can see that I mean waiting longer is only gonna increase the chance of DDR being successful again.

170
00:11:44,784 --> 00:11:45,528
Scott: so wait longer.

171
00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:54,323
Rym: step mania I got some updates and it's kind of way worse now like it's ugly as shit and it doesn't come with arrows that look like DDR.

172
00:11:54,383 --> 00:11:57,845
Scott: can you mod that like crazy though can't we just make it look like I tried?

173
00:11:57,945 --> 00:11:58,991
Rym: I gotta make it.

174
00:11:59,031 --> 00:12:02,429
Scott: we should just download the graphics from fourth mix plus and make it indistinguishable.

175
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:04,700
Scott: I found an actual fourth mix plus machine.

176
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,352
Rym: I found a pack someone made that was literally DDR fourth mix.

177
00:12:07,452 --> 00:12:22,838
Rym: shit yeah and I I have tried every way that the quote-unquote documentation of step mania says to make that work and it the arrows just seem to randomly look worse and worse and worse and don't look like the images I can see in the pack.

178
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:24,624
Rym: I'm telling it to you at least it's open source.

179
00:12:24,644 --> 00:12:26,009
Scott: you could work on it I could.

180
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:34,235
Rym: so in other news this kind of thing is happening a lot lately.

181
00:12:34,335 --> 00:12:37,428
Rym: so this is this particular story isn't really that noteworthy.

182
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:42,542
Rym: it's more that this kind of thing is something you really got to pay attention to especially attention to eSports.

183
00:12:43,044 --> 00:12:50,373
Rym: there's a counter-strike tournament and there is a long-standing glitch and it's kind of a fiddly glitch in counter-strike.

184
00:12:50,755 --> 00:12:54,533
Scott: where smoke counter-strike go you mean well yeah counter-strike.

185
00:12:54,594 --> 00:13:11,354
Rym: if you anyone who says counter-strike definitely means counters 1.7 1.6. because you know anyone who's counter-strike 1.6 today is not gonna say yo I play counter-strike they're gonna say yo I play counter-strike 1.6 semi-colon.

186
00:13:11,615 --> 00:13:15,411
Rym: it is far superior to all other counter-strikes and that's their whole life.

187
00:13:16,376 --> 00:13:18,707
Rym: if they say just counter strike they're playing whatever the new one is.

188
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:33,626
Rym: but this glitch has been around forever as far as I can tell and basically smoke grenade can put out a no idea.

189
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,077
Rym: I mean how do you even test for that smoke?

190
00:13:36,097 --> 00:13:37,485
Rym: there's a lot of different kinds of smoke grenades.

191
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:42,173
Scott: most of them are not explosions they're just putting out a Molotov really that strong in counter-strike.

192
00:13:42,193 --> 00:13:43,139
Scott: they don't burn that long.

193
00:13:43,642 --> 00:13:46,956
Scott: uh so if even if you even if you could do it reliably how good is it?

194
00:13:47,398 --> 00:13:51,975
Rym: have you ever played modern competitive counter-strike not competitively okay.

195
00:13:51,995 --> 00:13:55,027
Rym: so you've never played like modern five on five.

196
00:13:55,690 --> 00:14:04,923
Rym: basically it comes down to like really tight scripted rotations and picks and the strategies are real specific.

197
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:16,251
Rym: so if you throw a Molotov into an area like a choke you know guaranteed that that team is not going to come through that hallway for a specific number of seconds because that would be suicide.

198
00:14:16,673 --> 00:14:18,863
Rym: so you can plan accordingly and those seconds matter.

199
00:14:19,285 --> 00:14:25,555
Rym: so if you throw a Molotov down a hallway you can turn your back on it and go do your business whatever it is you're gonna do.

200
00:14:25,595 --> 00:14:33,254
Rym: but if that Molotov goes out earlier than it should have there can be people in places that your brain knows they cannot be and you're instantly dead.

201
00:14:34,218 --> 00:14:37,536
Scott: ah so you throw a Molotov and you know no one's coming from the left.

202
00:14:37,557 --> 00:14:40,051
Scott: so we're just gonna guard the right and wait and we'll know.

203
00:14:40,131 --> 00:14:45,320
Scott: we know the timing because we're pros of when the Molotov will be out and then we can pay attention to those places again.

204
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:49,437
Rym: it'd be like in you know quake where you see the quad damage.

205
00:14:49,477 --> 00:14:57,861
Rym: if someone gets it and now it's gone you know exactly how many seconds it'll be till someone can get quad damage again right and then suddenly someone just has quad damage again.

206
00:14:57,881 --> 00:14:59,367
Rym: that's what it's like.

207
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:05,392
Rym: but on a suit is a pretty significant effect if you can do it but it's difficult to pull off.

208
00:15:05,473 --> 00:15:06,518
Rym: it seems really glitchy.

209
00:15:06,598 --> 00:15:08,609
Scott: it's not just an automatic thing like smoke.

210
00:15:08,669 --> 00:15:10,438
Scott: throw a smoke at a Molotov and it goes out.

211
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:12,186
Rym: no sometimes they just bounce out of it.

212
00:15:12,547 --> 00:15:13,732
Rym: but it's been.

213
00:15:14,435 --> 00:15:15,198
Rym: incidents relate.

214
00:15:15,218 --> 00:15:15,961
Rym: this is the like.

215
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:28,433
Rym: the height of counter-strike is that this glitch which is difficult to trigger rare and highly situational has caused a problem in several super serious counter-strike tournaments in recent memory.

216
00:15:28,473 --> 00:15:29,237
Scott: so fix that shit.

217
00:15:29,297 --> 00:15:31,531
Rym: valve won't fix it and has made no statement.

218
00:15:31,632 --> 00:15:32,860
Scott: I guess they don't care about competitive.

219
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:37,695
Rym: counter-string valve seems to like not really care about game.

220
00:15:37,715 --> 00:15:39,019
Scott: this is okay.

221
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:40,848
Scott: so I mean no it's not just valve right.

222
00:15:41,109 --> 00:15:42,617
Scott: this is a thing that is happening.

223
00:15:42,698 --> 00:15:47,190
Scott: I think in every competitive like game there is period.

224
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,115
Rym: right companies.

225
00:15:50,217 --> 00:15:50,478
Scott: okay.

226
00:15:50,498 --> 00:15:53,628
Scott: so look I think Lowell takes care of their shit.

227
00:15:53,688 --> 00:16:00,914
Scott: right but very very few games take care of their competitive scene well and quickly.

228
00:16:00,974 --> 00:16:02,701
Scott: right netrunner is like the worst.

229
00:16:02,742 --> 00:16:04,572
Scott: they never update never update anything.

230
00:16:04,612 --> 00:16:06,161
Scott: you know communication from no one.

231
00:16:06,302 --> 00:16:07,951
Scott: I don't know about magic recently.

232
00:16:08,011 --> 00:16:08,936
Scott: I guess they're good.

233
00:16:08,996 --> 00:16:10,262
Rym: cuz magic is pretty good about.

234
00:16:10,322 --> 00:16:11,547
Scott: they're pretty good but it's like cycling.

235
00:16:11,628 --> 00:16:15,404
Rym: it took them a long time to get good right.

236
00:16:15,746 --> 00:16:16,369
Scott: Hearthstone.

237
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:21,694
Scott: it's like yeah they heard they're doing better but it's like there's just so slow at doing anything right.

238
00:16:21,775 --> 00:16:25,127
Rym: it's like overwatch is like if I it like holy shit.

239
00:16:25,207 --> 00:16:26,070
Scott: I ran it.

240
00:16:26,191 --> 00:16:29,623
Scott: I ran a competitive game like I was in charge of it.

241
00:16:29,924 --> 00:16:36,375
Scott: I would be updating that shit weekly and perhaps more often than weekly fixing everything polishing everything right.

242
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:41,980
Scott: when I saw like something you know going off the Prado frontier I'd be nerfing I'd be boosting.

243
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,684
Scott: I still want.

244
00:16:42,724 --> 00:16:45,981
Rym: that is literally what overwatch is like it has been since launch.

245
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:49,270
Scott: I'd be tweaking like we more than weekly.

246
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:50,954
Scott: you know so hot.

247
00:16:50,995 --> 00:17:00,962
Rym: so there's an argument to be made that cuz you know overwatch and most like people are trying to have seasons now to make spot eSports a little more reasonable to manage.

248
00:17:01,042 --> 00:17:13,339
Rym: yeah it would make sense to whatever the rules are at the start of season like if there's a glitch like unless like you have a rule like normal you got to do it like Debbie and Linux you get the stable and that you know.

249
00:17:13,642 --> 00:17:14,829
Rym: that is exactly what overwatch.

250
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:15,473
Rym: does you realize what?

251
00:17:15,515 --> 00:17:20,781
Rym: over the way overwatch works there is the legit current version that's in competitive during the season mm-hmm.

252
00:17:20,963 --> 00:17:22,509
Rym: there's also the public test region.

253
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:28,015
Rym: so the next set of tweaks is always there and you can just log in and play with the like.

254
00:17:28,076 --> 00:17:31,777
Rym: yeah the next set of rules and as soon as those are solid there are really push.

255
00:17:31,797 --> 00:17:40,783
Scott: there are a very large number of competitive games in the world and the number of ones that handle this sort of thing prop the competitive scene properly and tend to it like a garden.

256
00:17:40,803 --> 00:17:54,082
Rym: there is a good argument that you might not necessarily want to make constant minor changes in the course of a given season because that might benefit players who took advantage of things before later in the season.

257
00:17:54,444 --> 00:17:54,886
Rym: it's better.

258
00:17:55,268 --> 00:17:57,097
Rym: look what a hockey does every year they're like.

259
00:17:57,399 --> 00:17:57,499
Rym: so.

260
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,525
Rym: did anything go wrong this year?

261
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:00,215
Rym: oh yeah this thing happened.

262
00:18:00,235 --> 00:18:17,424
Rym: well but if something is egregious you gotta fix that shit right away and this one wouldn't be egregious except that these skills at the upper levels of counter-strike are so high and the factors that determine victory are so narrow that this is coming up repeatedly.

263
00:18:17,504 --> 00:18:20,497
Rym: mm-hmm but I don't think valve cares that much.

264
00:18:20,778 --> 00:18:21,381
Scott: they don't give a shit.

265
00:18:21,461 --> 00:18:28,128
Rym: counter-strike really feels like it's fallen off like it's not gonna be the big eSport down the road.

266
00:18:28,169 --> 00:18:30,039
Scott: well if they if they would just fix them.

267
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:31,508
Scott: you know they just tend to their garden.

268
00:18:31,548 --> 00:18:32,152
Scott: it'd be fun.

269
00:18:32,172 --> 00:18:33,560
Scott: it's still counter-strike.

270
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,544
Scott: it's still a big deal.

271
00:18:34,564 --> 00:18:35,829
Scott: I just feel like.

272
00:18:35,889 --> 00:18:37,455
Scott: I don't know.

273
00:18:37,596 --> 00:18:39,363
Rym: valve does not feel like a game company.

274
00:18:39,564 --> 00:18:44,912
Scott: it or it also counter-strike hasn't been the number one eSports since the mobas and such right.

275
00:18:44,972 --> 00:18:47,767
Scott: it's been like you know in the top five area.

276
00:18:47,787 --> 00:18:51,324
Scott: so it's probably gonna stay in the top five area just cuz it's fucking counter-strike.

277
00:18:51,384 --> 00:18:56,121
Scott: yep but you know it's not gonna be number one as long you know unless they clean that shit.

278
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:05,650
Rym: well anyway things of the day.

279
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:06,653
Rym: what do you got for me?

280
00:19:06,733 --> 00:19:07,336
Scott: what was my thing?

281
00:19:07,376 --> 00:19:07,899
Scott: they all right.

282
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,376
Scott: so this is website and on the website is a map or not?

283
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:11,859
Scott: I say map.

284
00:19:11,899 --> 00:19:13,909
Scott: it's a globe of the earth an interactive one.

285
00:19:13,949 --> 00:19:16,420
Scott: you can drag and zoom around like a Google Earth kind of deal.

286
00:19:16,963 --> 00:19:19,793
Scott: but on this globe of earth are green dots.

287
00:19:20,575 --> 00:19:29,142
Scott: now this each green dot represents a terrestrial radio station that you can stream on the internet for free.

288
00:19:29,604 --> 00:19:39,004
Scott: so you just zoom in on a green dot and you can hear that radio station playing as if you are standing in that general area on the earth obviously with internet delay.

289
00:19:39,486 --> 00:19:42,561
Scott: also it obviously does not have every radio station there is.

290
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:57,308
Scott: it has a very small percentage of them because not a lot of them are streaming on the internet for free but it has still plenty because there's so many terrestrial radio stations on earth and it's really fascinating to go and listen to ones far away.

291
00:19:57,328 --> 00:19:57,890
Scott: that's something I do.

292
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,699
Scott: and we travel like we were in Australia.

293
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,177
Scott: yeah and I was like oh my god turn on the Australian terrestrial radio.

294
00:20:03,217 --> 00:20:07,092
Scott: we got to hear what they got here Italian station.

295
00:20:07,133 --> 00:20:08,419
Rym: imagine America like.

296
00:20:08,439 --> 00:20:12,033
Rym: imagine people who are visiting America finding out what's on a.m.

297
00:20:12,094 --> 00:20:13,096
Rym: radio in America.

298
00:20:13,116 --> 00:20:18,835
Scott: oh god yeah listen don't judge us by our craziest people.

299
00:20:18,975 --> 00:20:22,574
Rym: if you ever come to America there's there's you know there's radio.

300
00:20:22,594 --> 00:20:22,935
Rym: we also.

301
00:20:23,015 --> 00:20:30,965
Scott: we also have I think more radio stations in other places cuz we're so big and we had radio before other places and such yep.

302
00:20:31,387 --> 00:20:35,305
Scott: but and we have the AM and the FM and I don't know well other places.

303
00:20:35,325 --> 00:20:37,596
Rym: well so am and FM have different usage profiles.

304
00:20:37,616 --> 00:20:40,890
Rym: am is actually more reliable in a lot of situations.

305
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,581
Scott: well because it's you can get higher power.

306
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:46,785
Scott: at least the FCC lets you have higher powers like this am stations in New York City.

307
00:20:46,805 --> 00:20:53,719
Scott: it's not just that it's better broadcast in the Empire State Building and you can hear them and like Connecticut and upstate and shit.

308
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,950
Scott: yeah Jersey you can hear them real far away.

309
00:20:57,392 --> 00:21:10,145
Rym: so if you've been playing Zelda which we're gonna talk about at all you occasionally encounter people who have a really weird set of dialogue that suddenly swerves into them threatening you and then they try to murder you.

310
00:21:10,165 --> 00:21:10,849
Rym: yeah

311
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,200
Scott: there's ninjas and if you beat the ninja boss

312
00:21:13,381 --> 00:21:14,929
Rym: members of the Yiga clan

313
00:21:14,989 --> 00:21:25,684
Scott: if you beat that their ninja boss which you have to do at some point if you want to game what will happen is randomly as you walk around the world from that point forward ninjas will just appear and be like haha

314
00:21:25,745 --> 00:21:27,678
Rym: I'm here like they don't even pretend anymore.

315
00:21:27,698 --> 00:21:31,909
Scott: yeah it's just like you be walking through the woods and suddenly you hear like haha poof and there's a ninja and it's like fuck.

316
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,480
Scott: I don't want to fight a ninja right now I'm busy.

317
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,104
Scott: god damn it.

318
00:21:34,285 --> 00:21:35,914
Rym: that was almost a mandark life you did there.

319
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:38,163
Scott: yeah that's that's what the ninjas do.

320
00:21:38,183 --> 00:21:42,281
Rym: I've only run into the ninjas as disguise.

321
00:21:42,381 --> 00:21:44,933
Scott: yeah you didn't beat the ninja boss yet you didn't.

322
00:21:44,953 --> 00:21:51,906
Rym: I anger the Yiga clan but when you when you kill one of them now when you first start the game like and you run into one of these guys.

323
00:21:52,247 --> 00:21:54,574
Rym: they are crazy dangerous.

324
00:21:54,595 --> 00:21:58,272
Scott: there's a trick to beating those easy ones yeah but one you gotta get it.

325
00:21:58,312 --> 00:22:01,290
Rym: yet have a little bit more equipment and maybe some art containers.

326
00:22:01,431 --> 00:22:04,887
Scott: now there's a trick the regular tiny guys who appear front.

327
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:10,362
Scott: you can just beat them with just arrows shoot him in the face and he goes ah and then you can shoot him in the face again before he does anything.

328
00:22:10,383 --> 00:22:14,284
Scott: you just keep shooting him with arrow until he died and you can go pick up his rupees.

329
00:22:14,304 --> 00:22:16,294
Rym: yep but they're distinguishing.

330
00:22:16,334 --> 00:22:23,126
Rym: characteristic is that when you kill them they always have bananas and you'll see why when you visit their their hideout.

331
00:22:23,448 --> 00:22:26,202
Scott: so this is a video their entire bananas - ash like I did.

332
00:22:26,403 --> 00:22:29,698
Rym: this is a video that someone made and it's just on Twitter and it is.

333
00:22:29,718 --> 00:22:34,478
Rym: it is the story of link and his bananas and it is more amusing than it should be.

334
00:22:34,699 --> 00:22:39,783
Scott: I recommend cooking five bananas together to make a potion that will get our food of some kind.

335
00:22:39,843 --> 00:22:42,355
Scott: it gives you plus three attack boost.

336
00:22:42,696 --> 00:22:46,435
Scott: so if you drink that shit or eat it whatever I don't even know what kind of food it is.

337
00:22:46,475 --> 00:22:48,386
Scott: just three minute five bananas cooked together.

338
00:22:48,406 --> 00:22:53,514
Scott: you can now beat really strong bad guys with a lot less sword swinging because you do so much more damage.

339
00:22:53,715 --> 00:22:56,269
Rym: yeah put some barbarian gear on you're good to go.

340
00:22:56,349 --> 00:22:58,662
Scott: yeah it's basically like you're eating.

341
00:22:58,702 --> 00:23:00,834
Scott: this is like putting on the strongest barbarian gear.

342
00:23:01,598 --> 00:23:06,017
Rym: so in the moment the booklet book is still Frank Gerberts dune we're going to be.

343
00:23:06,058 --> 00:23:12,501
Rym: well I am going to be because Scott is not coming live at Zank icon in a couple weeks.

344
00:23:12,983 --> 00:23:13,686
Scott: good luck with that.

345
00:23:13,906 --> 00:23:20,795
Rym: on Saturday I'll be doing our grind panel and foreign anime openers which the former you can just watch on YouTube.

346
00:23:20,956 --> 00:23:23,133
Rym: I mean if you're listening to this you don't need to go to that panel.

347
00:23:23,454 --> 00:23:28,618
Rym: I'm literally just gonna do the exact same thing that we do a packs but foreign anime openers.

348
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:36,150
Rym: the only way to ever see that is by going to a con where I do it and we stopped going to anime Boston because of the security.

349
00:23:36,871 --> 00:23:40,470
Rym: so there are many opportunities to see that panel and it'll never be on YouTube.

350
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:44,625
Rym: hmm and on Sunday I'll be doing our our rage quitting panel as well.

351
00:23:45,067 --> 00:23:50,862
Rym: hmm and otherwise I'm just gonna be in their tabletop because they actually have a pretty big tabletop area just playing games.

352
00:23:51,164 --> 00:23:53,334
Rym: hmm oh you still haven't put the new book club book on.

353
00:23:53,354 --> 00:23:55,907
Rym: the website still says Rebecca it's your book club.

354
00:23:56,289 --> 00:23:56,792
Rym: oh it is mine.

355
00:23:56,832 --> 00:23:58,643
Rym: I guess Rebecca was yours because I should edit it.

356
00:23:59,328 --> 00:24:00,495
Rym: when did you put Rebecca up?

357
00:24:00,555 --> 00:24:04,658
Rym: I feel like you only did it relatively recently in the span of how long we talked about Rebecca.

358
00:24:04,698 --> 00:24:06,507
Scott: go look and see the exact date I put it up.

359
00:24:06,889 --> 00:24:09,782
Rym: it's all moot because I'm not reading Dune until I beat Zelda.

360
00:24:10,325 --> 00:24:17,917
Scott: yeah even though I've beaten three out of four beasts in Zelda I'm still far away from beating that game and there's just so much stuff.

361
00:24:18,178 --> 00:24:37,664
Rym: yeah so uh the Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild is the first long-form like like triple-a single-player game I have played in many many many years where I stayed up late on more than one occasion when I should have gone to bed and kept playing it.

362
00:24:37,866 --> 00:24:40,644
Scott: you might have done that for some other Zelda's if you had actually fucking played him.

363
00:24:40,805 --> 00:24:44,953
Rym: yeah I mean I didn't like Twilight Princess that much like I got bored about a third of the way through just stopped.

364
00:24:44,973 --> 00:24:46,921
Scott: that one was okay.

365
00:24:47,102 --> 00:24:48,889
Rym: yeah it just it wasn't.

366
00:24:48,909 --> 00:24:52,906
Scott: the best part about that one was the ancient like you know Triforce area.

367
00:24:52,946 --> 00:25:01,553
Rym: like I didn't even get because the the problem with that game was that the whole beginning of the game which is so slow and easy and dumb and I just got sick of it didn't care anymore.

368
00:25:02,236 --> 00:25:06,414
Rym: I really liked the Zelda 3 remake but it was really just a Zelda 3 remake.

369
00:25:06,494 --> 00:25:08,582
Rym: there wasn't much else to it mm-hmm.

370
00:25:09,445 --> 00:25:14,282
Rym: so I I don't want to say this this is not the best Zelda game but it might be in my top five.

371
00:25:14,302 --> 00:25:16,610
Scott: it's real good.

372
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:23,620
Scott: top three I mean it's basically even though it you know cuz it's hard to say a lot of people like oh my god best game ever.

373
00:25:23,681 --> 00:25:24,767
Scott: oh my god best Zelda right.

374
00:25:24,827 --> 00:25:25,832
Scott: so it's too soon.

375
00:25:25,912 --> 00:25:32,112
Scott: it's too soon to say that but but what is true is that you know the same way.

376
00:25:32,152 --> 00:25:40,025
Scott: you won't say Evangelion is the best anime there is but it still changed anime and had this huge impact like like a nuke on the anime world.

377
00:25:40,467 --> 00:25:47,273
Scott: right this game has set the new standard for all single-player video games on all platforms.

378
00:25:47,434 --> 00:25:50,472
Scott: it's also it's like if you're not as good as this you're not worth playing.

379
00:25:50,833 --> 00:25:58,760
Rym: it is also definitely told people or shown people what an open world sandbox II type game should be.

380
00:25:58,941 --> 00:26:01,149
Rym: right it's a I mean Fallout 3 right.

381
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:04,408
Scott: people like oh look at this I was gonna compare it to the same game.

382
00:26:04,428 --> 00:26:09,199
Rym: yeah you wander around Fallout 3 and it's breathtaking for like 10 minutes and then you realize that everything's the same.

383
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,005
Rym: there's nothing.

384
00:26:10,085 --> 00:26:11,372
Scott: follow three is enormous.

385
00:26:12,075 --> 00:26:16,052
Scott: breath of the wild is I can't haven't measured it but it it's definitely bigger.

386
00:26:16,354 --> 00:26:24,367
Rym: I thought it was big already but I went into like this northeastern area that I haven't been to yet like last night is way.

387
00:26:24,387 --> 00:26:25,412
Scott: it's holy shit.

388
00:26:25,453 --> 00:26:28,630
Rym: there's like a whole world over there that I have not even encountered.

389
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:29,879
Scott: you don't even know how big it is.

390
00:26:29,939 --> 00:26:31,168
Scott: it's so big right I can't?

391
00:26:31,208 --> 00:26:33,139
Scott: that's something I've asked for for so long.

392
00:26:33,199 --> 00:26:33,943
Scott: I'm like Nintendo.

393
00:26:34,204 --> 00:26:38,403
Scott: just make another Super Metroid game exactly the same only like four times as big.

394
00:26:38,784 --> 00:26:42,141
Scott: oh my god just make this game only way way bigger.

395
00:26:42,221 --> 00:26:42,885
Scott: and it's like my other.

396
00:26:42,925 --> 00:26:44,915
Rym: complain about Zelda games for a long time has been.

397
00:26:45,256 --> 00:26:47,546
Rym: I don't want it to be just a linear plot of.

398
00:26:47,988 --> 00:26:51,020
Rym: go here get the item that lets you go to area to go to three.

399
00:26:51,040 --> 00:27:00,075
Scott: so you know Super Metroid I can say is the best game ever still at least for now and super mess Metroidvania ever made.

400
00:27:00,195 --> 00:27:10,366
Scott: Super Metroid perfected the get item to unlock new areas to get item to unlock new areas pattern and at the time that was a revolution in gaming and that is still a great way to make a game.

401
00:27:10,507 --> 00:27:15,267
Scott: yeah the problem is it people started making every game that way.

402
00:27:15,388 --> 00:27:29,247
Scott: every game where you're exploring a large space relatively large space was get the item to open the new area to get the item and get a new ability to open a new area and so forth and that's still a very good game design you know.

403
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:47,563
Scott: obviously you can follow that pattern and make a bad game or a great game but it just became tired because people have played it so much that now you know the openness of something that is like Zelda 1 which is just go anywhere the hell you want do anything you want became refreshing right?

404
00:27:47,683 --> 00:27:50,937
Rym: yeah that was the thing in the Zelda 1. like I can't.

405
00:27:50,977 --> 00:28:03,200
Rym: I was looking for the quote but I'm pretty sure Miyamoto or someone since I think was Miyamoto said something to the effect of you wanted the game to in some ways evoke the feeling yet as a kid of just wandering through forests and finding stuff right.

406
00:28:03,301 --> 00:28:09,392
Scott: and Zelda 1 and this game have so much in common and evoke that same feeling for the following reasons right.

407
00:28:09,734 --> 00:28:10,497
Scott: so number one.

408
00:28:10,517 --> 00:28:13,633
Scott: the first thing that this is in Zelda 1 have in common is that you know.

409
00:28:13,834 --> 00:28:16,429
Scott: you just appear at the start wherever the hell the start is.

410
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:18,483
Rym: yep and you don't know shit you don't know anything.

411
00:28:18,503 --> 00:28:20,034
Rym: then you probably have a. well you probably.

412
00:28:20,175 --> 00:28:22,067
Scott: you read the instructions and Zelda 1.

413
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:24,726
Rym: so you read these directions Zelda 1 or if you're playing breath of the wild.

414
00:28:24,908 --> 00:28:26,376
Scott: you know things about Zelda.

415
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:27,643
Scott: yeah unless this is your.

416
00:28:27,723 --> 00:28:28,890
Scott: yeah that's your little kid.

417
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,661
Rym: you have this vague idea of I'm linked.

418
00:28:30,701 --> 00:28:32,531
Rym: there's Ganon the princesses out there somewhere.

419
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:34,117
Scott: yeah and you should eat saving.

420
00:28:34,177 --> 00:28:41,487
Scott: so anyway you see a man wearing red and old white man wearing red with a white beard who you know.

421
00:28:41,507 --> 00:28:44,501
Scott: and so the one he just gives you a sword says don't go alone take this.

422
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:46,712
Scott: yeah but in in breath of the wild.

423
00:28:46,953 --> 00:28:52,376
Scott: he teaches you everything you need to know to go into the dangerous world which isn't just sword.

424
00:28:52,396 --> 00:29:03,060
Scott: yep right and they give you in that starting area every ability you need to actually play this game and they teach you how to use all those like imagine if it's Zelda 3.

425
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:09,632
Rym: they gave you every one of those items in the first hour of the game and then they dropped you into the world and said go nuts

426
00:29:09,974 --> 00:29:16,865
Scott: and you can go anywhere and do anything except you're limited by your skills and the dangerousness of the world and you

427
00:29:16,905 --> 00:29:18,050
Rym: don't know about the world.

428
00:29:18,211 --> 00:29:19,096
Rym: so you start playing.

429
00:29:19,116 --> 00:29:24,143
Rym: you're like like oh I'll climb up on that thing and then it's actually way taller than you expected.

430
00:29:24,163 --> 00:29:24,968
Rym: you fall to your death.

431
00:29:25,209 --> 00:29:29,518
Rym: yeah then you're like oh I'll go east and then you see a guy who kind of looks like a lion centaur.

432
00:29:29,538 --> 00:29:30,345
Rym: then you're immediately dead.

433
00:29:30,365 --> 00:29:31,251
Rym: you don't even know what happened.

434
00:29:31,332 --> 00:29:36,575
Scott: a lot of guys one-shot you generally in the game even later in the game even late in the game.

435
00:29:36,596 --> 00:29:41,846
Scott: it's like I'd have like 30 hearts or like like 10 hearts and 20 temporary hearts and a guy hits me and it takes.

436
00:29:41,886 --> 00:29:44,880
Scott: so even with my most defensive armor y'all lose 10 hearts.

437
00:29:45,342 --> 00:29:46,407
Scott: so it's like I got.

438
00:29:46,467 --> 00:29:52,116
Rym: modeling with one of those like particularly pokey Spears can do a lot of damage if you don't have a lot of defense.

439
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:53,243
Scott: yeah you can get messed up.

440
00:29:53,344 --> 00:29:56,462
Scott: they'll be like a robot with a laser and your old Zelda games.

441
00:29:56,482 --> 00:29:57,528
Scott: those are easy to dodge.

442
00:29:57,568 --> 00:29:58,412
Scott: they weren't a big deal.

443
00:29:58,432 --> 00:30:02,104
Scott: and in this game laser you're on fire and you're dead.

444
00:30:02,244 --> 00:30:04,312
Rym: yeah that sound it makes.

445
00:30:04,352 --> 00:30:04,875
Rym: that music.

446
00:30:04,915 --> 00:30:05,377
Rym: is that piano?

447
00:30:05,417 --> 00:30:09,433
Rym: music starts playing like you see the laser sight on your head.

448
00:30:09,855 --> 00:30:11,198
Scott: oh yeah all right.

449
00:30:11,259 --> 00:30:21,742
Scott: so the other thing that's just like Zelda one right is that as you go in Zelda one there were only like so many different like sprites and different things on the map.

450
00:30:21,802 --> 00:30:27,502
Scott: to you know the light was like tree brown tree staircase yeah rock ground.

451
00:30:27,622 --> 00:30:35,753
Scott: but it's like every area still felt way different right you had all these areas that like fell even though the map isn't that big.

452
00:30:35,793 --> 00:30:41,123
Scott: I memorize the whole freaking thing that like it feels like this geographic zones like it feels like a world.

453
00:30:41,163 --> 00:30:51,205
Scott: it's like you get the beach you got the you know the Lost Woods you got the graveyard mountains you got the forest you have all these like you know in each area sort of has.

454
00:30:51,285 --> 00:30:57,150
Scott: it feels like a separate significant place with like a meaning and a mood to it.

455
00:30:57,411 --> 00:31:09,154
Rym: holy shit just breath of the wild capture that like I'll be riding my horse and I'll see like here's an area where just a bunch of like foxes appear to live and there's like some stuff here in this tiny little area in the middle of this giant world.

456
00:31:09,476 --> 00:31:10,602
Rym: I remember that spot.

457
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:16,586
Scott: but the other thing that's all the one does to make that even stronger is to create landmarks right.

458
00:31:16,606 --> 00:31:24,300
Scott: so in Zelda one it would be like aha this is the spot on the beach where there's like these weird platforms out in the water.

459
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:29,077
Scott: oh and this is the spot where there's three trees arranged just so.

460
00:31:29,158 --> 00:31:30,122
Scott: and here's that.

461
00:31:30,182 --> 00:31:34,562
Scott: and here's the screen where there's two big rocks and it's like it has a name.

462
00:31:34,622 --> 00:31:38,643
Scott: and then you play this game and it's like oh there's just landmarks everywhere.

463
00:31:38,703 --> 00:31:40,413
Scott: it's like there's the tree that's on the.

464
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:42,987
Scott: that's just for some reason on the peak of a mountain.

465
00:31:43,007 --> 00:31:44,416
Rym: yeah I wonder what's up there.

466
00:31:44,516 --> 00:31:48,941
Scott: I wonder what's the deal with that is and it's like oh there's the three caves.

467
00:31:48,962 --> 00:31:50,389
Scott: I don't even know if there is the three caves.

468
00:31:50,429 --> 00:31:59,894
Rym: I'm even better because the carrot like one of the first characters you talk to basically early in the game says there is a village and he gives you directions.

469
00:32:00,417 --> 00:32:07,672
Rym: that are the kinds of directions a real person would give you in the real world to get to a place and the map doesn't just show you where it is.

470
00:32:08,014 --> 00:32:09,804
Rym: you just like go and see oh there's a mountain.

471
00:32:09,824 --> 00:32:11,212
Rym: that kind of looks like what he said.

472
00:32:11,533 --> 00:32:13,421
Rym: I guess I'll follow the road toward that.

473
00:32:13,602 --> 00:32:15,973
Scott: but like those landmarks it's like you know.

474
00:32:15,993 --> 00:32:33,201
Scott: they sort of give you like this feeling of like it help you navigate because you can remember landmarks right and they give you feelings of meaning to places right just like putting a few rocks in a particular pattern in the spot like gives that space like a meaning and a reason to go there and take a look and see what's going on.

475
00:32:33,261 --> 00:32:33,423
Scott: right.

476
00:32:33,443 --> 00:32:34,992
Scott: it's something to look at something to do there.

477
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:40,252
Rym: now a side point in terms of making it interesting to go and look at those things.

478
00:32:40,935 --> 00:32:53,578
Rym: the the little Korok guy quests there's 900 of them are brilliant in that regard because these quests basically if you ever see something that looks interesting at all odds are if you fuck with it even a little bit you'll get rewarded.

479
00:32:53,779 --> 00:32:55,429
Scott: it does something everything does something.

480
00:32:55,469 --> 00:33:05,100
Rym: so like literally you'll be like riding your horse down a road for many minutes like on your way to a town you've heard of because some guy said there's a town that way I'm super late in the game.

481
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,531
Scott: there's a town that a guy just told me about.

482
00:33:07,792 --> 00:33:10,865
Scott: that I had never been to and I have to go find it now.

483
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:25,771
Rym: I just found another ancient tech laboratory and I'm like oh great I guess there's more of stuff but you'll just be like on your way to this place and then you see a circle of rocks except one of the rocks is missing from the circle and you're like

484
00:33:25,871 --> 00:33:36,504
Scott: huh and even though this is just like this would be in any other game just like a wasted space just like a grassy area that just exists to me to make it take longer for you to get from point A to point B.

485
00:33:36,624 --> 00:33:44,426
Rym: if you wander off and find a rock and walk back over and put it in the spot to complete the ring totally a quest yep so that's the main difference.

486
00:33:44,446 --> 00:33:47,357
Scott: you talk about fallout 3 right and fallout 3 you have.

487
00:33:47,377 --> 00:33:55,083
Scott: not only are all the different things to do just repetitive it's either like kill some guys or fetch a thing.

488
00:33:55,665 --> 00:33:59,040
Scott: and oh this cave looks exactly just like every other cave.

489
00:33:59,161 --> 00:34:03,239
Scott: this house looks exactly like every other house in in breath of the wild.

490
00:34:03,259 --> 00:34:08,820
Scott: this is huge world but the world is like jam-packed and rich full of stuff.

491
00:34:08,981 --> 00:34:09,463
Scott: everywhere.

492
00:34:09,543 --> 00:34:12,576
Scott: it's like down to the micro and the macro level.

493
00:34:13,059 --> 00:34:14,666
Scott: you know everything is like interesting.

494
00:34:14,706 --> 00:34:27,539
Scott: it's like how many people and how many hours did they spend like manually populating this giant video game space with so much shit and just little details like if you're on a road like at night.

495
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:30,356
Rym: sometimes you'll see a little bit of torchlight off in the distance and you'll just.

496
00:34:30,416 --> 00:34:34,842
Rym: people are traveling back and forth consistently between places and getting it in.

497
00:34:34,882 --> 00:34:44,248
Rym: if there's monsters there the monster just attack them and if you save them then they react to you and like they remember you and the world just keeps changing as you mess with it it doesn't change them.

498
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:50,632
Scott: those people's traveling people are mostly set in they are certain but they're all.

499
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:54,469
Rym: they're almost all tied to some minor quests right some kind.

500
00:34:54,509 --> 00:35:00,135
Scott: but it's like you know it's there isn't like this repeated stuff like everything is varied and you'll see.

501
00:35:00,215 --> 00:35:14,407
Scott: you know and just by taking these sit like you I was I was going down I was horsing down a road and I see to my left there's like a grassy area that's kind of long and has an interesting significant shape to it like a landmark you would see in Zelda 1 and has weird trees like.

502
00:35:14,467 --> 00:35:16,334
Scott: they look sort of like baobab trees from I

503
00:35:16,696 --> 00:35:18,361
Rym: know and it's like in there you go in there

504
00:35:18,763 --> 00:35:21,231
Scott: and it's like

505
00:35:22,015 --> 00:35:22,116
Rym: even

506
00:35:22,136 --> 00:35:29,996
Scott: though this is just a little place that sort of fills up space on the map here in between two different other things like it has the sort of significance it's.

507
00:35:30,136 --> 00:35:31,524
Scott: it's different from other places.

508
00:35:31,604 --> 00:35:33,916
Scott: it's like you pay attention to it just because it's.

509
00:35:34,037 --> 00:35:35,384
Scott: it feels nice in there.

510
00:35:35,525 --> 00:35:40,884
Scott: it's like it has a you know sort of a you know significance to it.

511
00:35:40,944 --> 00:35:42,188
Rym: so it feels real.

512
00:35:42,228 --> 00:35:47,036
Rym: it feels like when I was a kid and it's not like to the woods and it's not just meaningless to go in there.

513
00:35:47,177 --> 00:35:47,942
Scott: just look around.

514
00:35:48,002 --> 00:35:53,352
Scott: it's like there's all kinds of mushrooms to collect in there and this stuff happening in every single one of these places.

515
00:35:53,432 --> 00:35:54,618
Rym: yep like I got.

516
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:55,864
Rym: I got to one area.

517
00:35:55,924 --> 00:35:57,029
Rym: I said this big grassy field.

518
00:35:57,049 --> 00:35:59,885
Rym: I'm like huh and I see some horses way off in the distance.

519
00:35:59,945 --> 00:36:03,227
Rym: I'm like yeah I don't have a horse with me right now I don't know where a nearby stable is.

520
00:36:03,267 --> 00:36:03,972
Rym: I should go get a horse.

521
00:36:04,012 --> 00:36:04,756
Rym: it'll make this easier.

522
00:36:04,776 --> 00:36:13,218
Rym: and then I start going toward the horses and I realized that those horses all have riders and those riders are all Bokoblins with Spears right.

523
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:14,945
Rym: so now I got to deal with that.

524
00:36:15,126 --> 00:36:16,270
Scott: so the game is not.

525
00:36:16,451 --> 00:36:18,527
Scott: but it looks like what the negative things in this game.

526
00:36:18,587 --> 00:36:20,117
Scott: right because we just talked about the game.

527
00:36:20,158 --> 00:36:21,567
Scott: we'd be here for like an hour right.

528
00:36:21,647 --> 00:36:22,812
Scott: so there's our negative thing.

529
00:36:22,872 --> 00:36:29,514
Scott: so one negative thing is that the controls are not a hundred percent perfect.

530
00:36:29,574 --> 00:36:31,283
Scott: the camera they're way good.

531
00:36:31,303 --> 00:36:33,152
Rym: actually the camera to scroll faster.

532
00:36:33,252 --> 00:36:37,527
Scott: the pro controller is very very significantly better than the.

533
00:36:37,688 --> 00:36:40,999
Scott: the other regular controllers very significantly better.

534
00:36:42,423 --> 00:36:46,199
Scott: however here's an example of something that is not good right.

535
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:57,991
Scott: so in every other Zelda game you either couldn't jump or I guess there were 2d Zelda games you got the feather and you could jump with a which is knowing the second Zelda you could jump sure guess so.

536
00:36:58,071 --> 00:37:02,530
Scott: but in 3d Zelda games in 3d Zelda games the jumping was always automatic.

537
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:04,496
Scott: you would just walk and link would jump.

538
00:37:04,857 --> 00:37:05,077
Scott: right.

539
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:09,952
Scott: in this game you jump by pressing a button.

540
00:37:10,655 --> 00:37:16,223
Scott: so of course if you're making a video game you want a to be the jump button right because B is the running button.

541
00:37:16,263 --> 00:37:17,289
Scott: it makes sense like Mario.

542
00:37:17,309 --> 00:37:18,656
Rym: there's some knockoff bullshit game.

543
00:37:18,676 --> 00:37:19,621
Rym: then up is the jump on.

544
00:37:19,722 --> 00:37:21,230
Scott: why is the attacking button?

545
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:29,642
Scott: and in every 3ds all the game so far since there was no jumping you would use a as your sort of interact with things.

546
00:37:29,703 --> 00:37:32,072
Scott: button like read read the sign talk to the person.

547
00:37:32,232 --> 00:37:41,965
Scott: oh so because they ran out of buttons and because you don't need X for the item button anymore X has become the jump button.

548
00:37:41,985 --> 00:37:46,258
Rym: it's like oh my god for like 10 minutes isn't good but you can see why they done that right.

549
00:37:46,299 --> 00:37:51,054
Scott: another thing that's bad.

550
00:37:51,074 --> 00:37:57,764
Scott: there'll be like certain puzzles in the game that are real finicky right as soon as you use the motion controls.

551
00:37:58,247 --> 00:37:59,251
Scott: well that's one thing.

552
00:37:59,291 --> 00:38:03,430
Scott: but you know in other Zelda games let's say there's a block pushing puzzle.

553
00:38:04,173 --> 00:38:09,353
Scott: the block would be like on rails and you couldn't possibly push the block in a wrong way.

554
00:38:09,835 --> 00:38:11,241
Scott: or mess yourself up right.

555
00:38:11,562 --> 00:38:12,888
Rym: and these are all physics based.

556
00:38:12,928 --> 00:38:15,118
Rym: like it's always you might push it off a cliff.

557
00:38:15,319 --> 00:38:15,882
Rym: it's talking.

558
00:38:15,902 --> 00:38:23,739
Scott: well all physics engines so like it sometimes give a real finicky to get the block in just the right spot or you know get that thing balanced.

559
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,629
Scott: just so is that you can complete the puzzle.

560
00:38:25,649 --> 00:38:35,634
Rym: but with that negative also comes a slight positive in that the puzzles can be pretty complex and your solutions can be the kinds of things that in other Zelda games you would think.

561
00:38:35,714 --> 00:38:37,745
Rym: why can't I just do this right?

562
00:38:37,785 --> 00:38:39,574
Rym: why can't I just throw the thing over there?

563
00:38:39,635 --> 00:38:43,053
Rym: because if you come up with a clever way to beat a puzzle it'll probably work right.

564
00:38:43,574 --> 00:38:46,182
Scott: it's finicky because it's free form.

565
00:38:46,804 --> 00:38:51,339
Scott: but by allowing for that finickyness you get the free form.

566
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:52,423
Scott: this there was a place.

567
00:38:52,443 --> 00:38:59,637
Scott: I just went over there cuz I saw a beach and I wanted to go to the beach and then I saw some stuff in the distance and I wanted to go to it.

568
00:38:59,677 --> 00:39:00,139
Scott: so I did.

569
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:06,366
Scott: and then when I got over there I saw a real dangerous dude and he was gonna kill me in one shot.

570
00:39:06,447 --> 00:39:10,586
Scott: but I also saw he was keeping his treasure chest in the interesting place I saw from far away.

571
00:39:10,606 --> 00:39:12,636
Scott: so I used my stealth.

572
00:39:13,078 --> 00:39:20,890
Scott: I grabbed the interesting treasure chest that were full of like 500 rupees dove off the cliff into the water before he noticed.

573
00:39:21,633 --> 00:39:22,316
Rym: I spent like.

574
00:39:22,336 --> 00:39:26,676
Scott: you can't do that if the game's not free form and a more strict game would have been like.

575
00:39:26,917 --> 00:39:29,468
Scott: you must come into this area through this entrance.

576
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:42,093
Rym: you know where you're getting the treasure without beating the bad guy up now to prevent you from because the fact that you can kind of fly and if you level up your stamina and get some climbing gear you can climb real high and just jump into everything.

577
00:39:42,133 --> 00:39:44,706
Rym: so like there's these mazes I found this giant labyrinth.

578
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:48,949
Rym: the way they prevent you from just flying over the top of it is very clever.

579
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:55,801
Rym: the game makes like real-world reasons why you can't do something rather than just invisible blocking you like every other Zelda game.

580
00:39:55,861 --> 00:39:56,083
Rym: yeah.

581
00:39:56,223 --> 00:40:09,065
Rym: so if you try to fly over the top of that thing sure that seems to work except there's all these flying ancient monstrosities flying around the top of the thing and they attack you if you come anywhere near the top of that labyrinth

582
00:40:09,105 --> 00:40:15,421
Scott: and even if you go to where you think the end of the labyrinth is and just drop in from the top it's like okay congratulations.

583
00:40:15,482 --> 00:40:17,855
Scott: now you're in the labyrinth but you're in a labyrinth now.

584
00:40:17,875 --> 00:40:20,329
Scott: it's getting out kind of sucks but it's like you can do it.

585
00:40:20,369 --> 00:40:20,892
Scott: go ahead.

586
00:40:20,933 --> 00:40:27,587
Scott: it's like the labyrinth is actually designed in such a way at the bottom where there's all these walls that extend to the ceiling.

587
00:40:27,888 --> 00:40:30,740
Scott: but there are openings in these walls that are only at the bottom.

588
00:40:30,921 --> 00:40:41,337
Scott: and so it's like unless you know the labyrinth already coming in from the top only helps you so much you still have to do some work and you get attacked by those sky watchers anyway and those things are real danger.

589
00:40:41,478 --> 00:40:44,075
Scott: well you went to the suit the most dangerous labyrinth first.

590
00:40:44,216 --> 00:40:46,932
Rym: Wow which is also what I did I didn't know there were other labyrinth.

591
00:40:46,952 --> 00:40:51,253
Scott: there are three labyrinths for the three pieces of Barbaro gear the other two labyrinths.

592
00:40:51,293 --> 00:40:59,558
Rym: I went I saw a tower in the distance and I wanted to get it because I wanted to fill in a part of the map and on my way to the tower I saw the labyrinth.

593
00:40:59,578 --> 00:40:59,921
Rym: I'm like who?

594
00:40:59,941 --> 00:41:01,532
Rym: what the fuck is that I went over there instead?

595
00:41:01,552 --> 00:41:06,954
Scott: I did that too but I went to that area only after having a reason to go to that area.

596
00:41:06,974 --> 00:41:09,227
Scott: that's also my favorite area of the game that Akkala.

597
00:41:09,368 --> 00:41:12,467
Rym: so the feeling of the controls the only times it really gives cause.

598
00:41:12,487 --> 00:41:19,456
Rym: the problem for me is I will often with the regular controller accidentally crouch when I'm in the middle of a fight.

599
00:41:19,697 --> 00:41:22,998
Rym: this is real easy to accidentally push your left thumb a little time.

600
00:41:23,118 --> 00:41:26,154
Scott: you know that's been around since PlayStation where you push the analog sticks.

601
00:41:26,215 --> 00:41:26,938
Scott: I hate that too.

602
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:30,214
Scott: in as a button that shouldn't be a button add two more buttons.

603
00:41:30,737 --> 00:41:34,336
Scott: I know people are gonna go it's fine and yeah I don't really have a problem with it that often.

604
00:41:34,718 --> 00:41:37,610
Scott: but in this game in principle I don't like.

605
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:38,575
Scott: because like what?

606
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:42,639
Scott: if I'm just like moving the stick aggressively I'm going to push it inwards right.

607
00:41:42,699 --> 00:41:43,906
Scott: it's just the thing that happens.

608
00:41:43,946 --> 00:41:49,458
Rym: in fact the more tense the fight is the more likely I'm to push it inwards and that has killed me easily half a dozen times.

609
00:41:49,478 --> 00:41:55,379
Scott: yeah I do not like you know analog sticks being pushed in ever but that's just the thing.

610
00:41:55,439 --> 00:42:03,896
Rym: so whatever yep but that feeling is also is a problem in one very specific minor area that I wouldn't complain about except it's so integral to the game.

611
00:42:04,881 --> 00:42:09,183
Rym: I have thrown my cooking ingredients in the fire next to the cook pot like ten times.

612
00:42:09,243 --> 00:42:10,611
Scott: that's happened a lot to me as well.

613
00:42:10,752 --> 00:42:11,876
Rym: I lost some.

614
00:42:11,977 --> 00:42:13,423
Rym: I saw some good stuff to the fire.

615
00:42:13,443 --> 00:42:13,804
Scott: I didn't.

616
00:42:14,106 --> 00:42:18,608
Scott: it was not easy to figure out the interface for like hold Oh hold multiple things and drop.

617
00:42:18,629 --> 00:42:19,472
Scott: it didn't.

618
00:42:19,552 --> 00:42:21,878
Scott: it wasn't obvious okay.

619
00:42:21,918 --> 00:42:29,544
Scott: so another flaw in this game is that it's very annoying early in the game that your weapons degrade.

620
00:42:29,564 --> 00:42:31,130
Scott: they degrade too quickly.

621
00:42:31,492 --> 00:42:34,468
Rym: now I would argue that it's a positive in a very different sense.

622
00:42:34,528 --> 00:42:34,749
Scott: right.

623
00:42:34,789 --> 00:42:36,380
Scott: well that's what I was gonna get right.

624
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:41,991
Scott: it's like they made this negative thing where you get weapons and you beat a bunch of bad guys up and then your weapons are gone.

625
00:42:42,011 --> 00:42:46,232
Scott: you got to use like the weapons the bad guys dropped or do other things to beat them.

626
00:42:46,252 --> 00:42:50,432
Rym: I use a lot of Bokoblin clubs from the early game I mean even later in the game.

627
00:42:50,473 --> 00:42:52,125
Scott: I'm pretty much using stuff bad guys drop.

628
00:42:52,165 --> 00:42:59,472
Scott: well they're just dropping better stuff for me and that's kind of frustrating like especially way early in the game.

629
00:42:59,773 --> 00:43:06,430
Rym: it's super frustrating but it adds this element combined with the fact that you have stamina like you think I'll just climb to the top of this thing.

630
00:43:06,892 --> 00:43:14,485
Rym: well do you have enough stamina like you might not be able to make it to the top and then you fuck right it and the cooking and the danger.

631
00:43:14,505 --> 00:43:22,331
Rym: it means that it has this sort of like survival in the wild aspect which really adds to what I think.

632
00:43:22,371 --> 00:43:28,598
Scott: what it does is it just forces you to variate what you're doing right and I'll just fight everything you run into.

633
00:43:28,638 --> 00:43:36,989
Scott: well no in other Zelda games right you would get the best stuff and then you would just always use you like in Zelda 64. once you got the mirror shield like that was it?

634
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:38,416
Scott: yep you're still the one.

635
00:43:38,597 --> 00:43:43,865
Scott: once you got the big once you got the big Goron sword the master sword you that those only two swords you use.

636
00:43:43,925 --> 00:43:47,822
Rym: if you've got the master sword you never use that whiz robe thing ever again.

637
00:43:48,244 --> 00:43:48,445
Scott: right?

638
00:43:48,485 --> 00:43:52,483
Scott: it's like you know once you have certain things you don't use the crappier stuff.

639
00:43:52,564 --> 00:43:57,067
Scott: now it's like yeah you'll find crappy stuff once you have better stuff and it'll be too crappy.

640
00:43:57,550 --> 00:44:00,927
Scott: but you still use a variant stuff to fight different guys.

641
00:44:00,947 --> 00:44:03,118
Scott: you got to get different kinds of arrows and got it.

642
00:44:03,138 --> 00:44:06,799
Scott: you know you got to really mix it up because things are getting destroyed all the time.

643
00:44:06,819 --> 00:44:07,846
Scott: you can't keep using the same.

644
00:44:07,866 --> 00:44:11,909
Rym: it also gives you this sense of a real world because that I'm glad the game didn't make.

645
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:14,242
Rym: you actually get hungry and need to eat food just to live.

646
00:44:14,262 --> 00:44:15,408
Scott: yeah that that was like.

647
00:44:15,629 --> 00:44:18,662
Rym: you do need to eat food or find places to sleep.

648
00:44:18,703 --> 00:44:20,932
Scott: yeah there aren't hearts lying on the ground.

649
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:25,694
Scott: right when you kill a bad guy they drop stuff that makes sense for them to drop.

650
00:44:25,734 --> 00:44:30,516
Scott: yeah when you kill a keys it drops bat wings and occasionally extra good eyeballs.

651
00:44:30,697 --> 00:44:32,566
Rym: yeah it's never gonna drop rupees.

652
00:44:32,667 --> 00:44:38,415
Scott: you can turn those into rupees cuz every place that sells and buy stuff will buy things from you for the same exact price.

653
00:44:38,516 --> 00:44:41,268
Scott: yeah so an eyeball is worth X rupees at worst.

654
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:45,510
Scott: or you can use it for cooking something or take it to the monster shop or you know.

655
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:49,274
Scott: you get these resources by killing things and you can use them in a variety of ways or cycle.

656
00:44:49,314 --> 00:44:55,522
Rym: just makes the game feel very much like this sort of real world dangerous well environment.

657
00:44:55,542 --> 00:44:59,541
Scott: they did something that no other Zelda game had ever done which is to make rupees matter.

658
00:44:59,561 --> 00:45:01,069
Rym: oh no he's matter a lot.

659
00:45:01,089 --> 00:45:09,007
Scott: every other Zelda game you'd be getting rupees all the time but once you bought everything there was to buy with rupees you didn't need rupees anymore.

660
00:45:09,027 --> 00:45:10,676
Scott: you just got them all the time.

661
00:45:10,776 --> 00:45:12,163
Rym: for what was the minish cab?

662
00:45:12,203 --> 00:45:15,641
Rym: have minish cab I think I nine nine nine rupees and nine nine nine shells.

663
00:45:15,661 --> 00:45:15,902
Rym: I was like.

664
00:45:15,982 --> 00:45:21,893
Scott: well in Zelda one an arrow would cost you a rupee but once you had every it didn't really matter anymore right?

665
00:45:22,073 --> 00:45:24,883
Scott: yeah until this Zelda game it's like.

666
00:45:24,984 --> 00:45:28,381
Scott: I still need more rupees even though I found the bowling game and I'm getting.

667
00:45:28,421 --> 00:45:32,342
Scott: basically I'm basically able to farm rupees at like 280 rupees a minute.

668
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:34,855
Rym: I've been cooking expensive dishes and selling them right.

669
00:45:34,895 --> 00:45:37,991
Scott: it's like once even though I have a zillion rupees I need more.

670
00:45:38,031 --> 00:45:39,639
Scott: this is a fancy armor I want to buy.

671
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:45,264
Scott: that cost six thousand rupees and I spent ten thousand rupees like to get a fairy fountain.

672
00:45:45,666 --> 00:45:46,389
Scott: it's like damn.

673
00:45:46,489 --> 00:45:51,273
Scott: I need more rupees all the time and there's plenty of them out there but I still want more.

674
00:45:51,313 --> 00:45:52,459
Scott: I need more rupees.

675
00:45:52,941 --> 00:45:54,126
Scott: no other Zelda game has done that.

676
00:45:54,146 --> 00:46:02,887
Rym: I also appreciate how dangerous it makes the world feel in general like there's this very powerful cycle of your stuff is not that strong.

677
00:46:02,907 --> 00:46:06,223
Rym: you don't have that many hearts so going to places feels scary.

678
00:46:06,244 --> 00:46:19,428
Scott: you're like sneaking around and avoid just like in Zelda 1. if you went up to the northern parts of Zelda 1 and the overworld but when you were not strong enough that it was way dangerous up there you went to the graveyard with like your wooden sword is there?

679
00:46:19,469 --> 00:46:20,534
Scott: take you so many stabs.

680
00:46:20,554 --> 00:46:21,679
Scott: those ghosts would mess you up.

681
00:46:22,342 --> 00:46:29,342
Rym: but then you get some weapons you get some hearts you get some stamina wheels and some confidence you get some you get better at the game and you start to feel better.

682
00:46:29,363 --> 00:46:34,728
Rym: but then you wander into this desert and there's way differently dangerous stuff in there.

683
00:46:34,788 --> 00:46:35,633
Rym: now you're scared again.

684
00:46:35,693 --> 00:46:44,079
Scott: yeah it's like even if you have a whole bunch of stuff and you're like normally in like an RPG you would level up and then you'd no longer be afraid of things once you're leveled up so much.

685
00:46:44,099 --> 00:46:46,009
Scott: yep you still need skills.

686
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:46,552
Scott: in this game.

687
00:46:46,713 --> 00:46:51,901
Scott: everything is still super dangerous even when you level up a whole time those line else right.

688
00:46:51,941 --> 00:46:59,361
Scott: it's like you can go to a Lionel and it's like if you have skills you can beat Lionel with like a stick in a pot lid or a bunch of sticks and a bunch of pot lids cuz they'll keep breaking.

689
00:47:00,085 --> 00:47:07,739
Scott: or you can go to Lionel the dangerous dude with a whole ton of masterful equipment and still get your ass kicked cuz you don't have skills.

690
00:47:08,181 --> 00:47:09,630
Rym: so Lionel's are interesting.

691
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:18,392
Rym: it does a million damage because in one of the cool one of the great beast quest you basically they're like yeah the best way to get shock arrows is to go seal him from this.

692
00:47:18,433 --> 00:47:18,875
Rym: Lionel.

693
00:47:19,278 --> 00:47:20,767
Rym: he's super dangerous though watch out.

694
00:47:20,808 --> 00:47:27,597
Rym: so I just snuck up there and I kept seeing him in the distance and I took a picture of him and told my sensor to key on him.

695
00:47:27,617 --> 00:47:35,389
Rym: and I just walked slowly counterclockwise picking up arrows that he had left behind and making sure he didn't see me.

696
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:49,980
Scott: and if that area is designed in such a way that when you finally finish the loop around and all right at the very end is this little outlet place with a whole bunch of arrows on this one tree and you take them all and then it conveniently there's little outcropping.

697
00:47:50,282 --> 00:47:53,779
Scott: if you jump off of it you land in the water exactly where you need to go.

698
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:57,837
Scott: yeah so it's like they designed it specifically so that you would sneak around and jump off.

699
00:47:57,857 --> 00:48:04,667
Rym: he saw me and was running at me and I grabbed the arrows and ran and jump right.

700
00:48:04,728 --> 00:48:06,900
Scott: it's like you could have just fought him and beat him.

701
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:12,007
Scott: it's possible but they designed it so that you would sneak around and jump off and sneaking actually works.

702
00:48:12,168 --> 00:48:14,019
Rym: so the other night I was just wandering.

703
00:48:14,059 --> 00:48:17,821
Rym: it was night in the game because there's day night cycle and rain and lightning and all that stuff.

704
00:48:18,143 --> 00:48:25,056
Rym: it was a night and I just was like on my way somewhere and an area I haven't really explored and I see like something in the distance.

705
00:48:25,077 --> 00:48:26,102
Rym: I can't quite see what it is.

706
00:48:26,464 --> 00:48:28,234
Rym: so I clicked the thing to Emily sit next to me.

707
00:48:28,254 --> 00:48:29,320
Rym: I clicked the thing to zoom in on it.

708
00:48:29,381 --> 00:48:32,841
Rym: Emily's like wow it's a line out like this blue looking one.

709
00:48:32,901 --> 00:48:33,787
Scott: those are real dangerous.

710
00:48:33,847 --> 00:48:34,592
Scott: I couldn't beat that one.

711
00:48:34,612 --> 00:48:35,577
Scott: I beat some other ones.

712
00:48:35,617 --> 00:48:37,708
Scott: I beat a zebra looking one and a red one.

713
00:48:37,728 --> 00:48:38,854
Rym: so he's way far away.

714
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:43,639
Rym: the blue one messed me up and his eyes are glowing and he's looking straight at me mm-hmm.

715
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,290
Rym: and so I just stand there and I'm like holy shit.

716
00:48:46,391 --> 00:48:47,557
Rym: that is really creepy.

717
00:48:47,959 --> 00:48:54,193
Rym: he's just like looking straight at me but I'm way far away from him right like wait his perfect arrow shot and he's got three hours at once.

718
00:48:54,313 --> 00:48:58,190
Rym: so I on zoom and I just stand there like is he gonna attack me?

719
00:48:58,290 --> 00:49:01,084
Rym: and he just stands there not moving just stare.

720
00:49:01,144 --> 00:49:01,848
Rym: I zoom in again.

721
00:49:01,888 --> 00:49:03,114
Rym: he's always staring at me.

722
00:49:03,576 --> 00:49:05,123
Rym: so finally I back up a little bit.

723
00:49:05,163 --> 00:49:06,147
Rym: he doesn't react at all.

724
00:49:06,489 --> 00:49:08,800
Rym: so I assume maybe you know I'm out of his range.

725
00:49:09,504 --> 00:49:11,192
Rym: so I turn around and start walking away.

726
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:15,811
Rym: suddenly all these arrows come raining down from behind and I spin back around.

727
00:49:15,992 --> 00:49:17,337
Rym: he's right next to me and then I'm dead.

728
00:49:17,578 --> 00:49:20,308
Rym: yep that was really scary.

729
00:49:20,649 --> 00:49:24,526
Scott: that's the thing is the game is so free even right and it's in his.

730
00:49:24,727 --> 00:49:26,014
Scott: you know you can just do whatever.

731
00:49:26,355 --> 00:49:34,560
Scott: that it creates stories almost like the dwarf fortress creates stories right of the things that happen with all these interacting systems that actually interact and work well together.

732
00:49:35,002 --> 00:49:37,476
Scott: but like in other Zelda games you can only climb in a vine.

733
00:49:37,496 --> 00:49:39,105
Scott: now you can climb on anything almost.

734
00:49:39,186 --> 00:49:40,372
Scott: you know it's out of games.

735
00:49:40,693 --> 00:49:42,500
Scott: you know trying to thing wouldn't work.

736
00:49:42,601 --> 00:49:48,165
Scott: only the very specific thing the specific way to do something worked and you had to do that.

737
00:49:48,226 --> 00:49:49,512
Rym: it's like I can't be clever.

738
00:49:49,593 --> 00:49:50,578
Scott: anything will work.

739
00:49:50,759 --> 00:49:52,308
Scott: all your clever things will actually work.

740
00:49:52,329 --> 00:49:55,524
Scott: you can drop a metal thing from really high up onto a bad guy.

741
00:49:55,584 --> 00:49:56,589
Scott: it'll crush and kill him.

742
00:49:56,890 --> 00:50:02,292
Rym: yeah I've thrown by push boulders down and knocked my bokoblins off their horses.

743
00:50:02,352 --> 00:50:06,616
Scott: right they actually spent some ridiculous amount of time to make all these systems like interact.

744
00:50:06,636 --> 00:50:11,703
Scott: you can put a food on the ground and a bad guy will go over and try to get the food and be distracted.

745
00:50:11,724 --> 00:50:12,689
Rym: favorite thing when I want.

746
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:15,769
Rym: you know sometimes there's a whole bunch of bokoblins like in a little skull house.

747
00:50:16,612 --> 00:50:25,183
Rym: so what I like to do is I'll roll a bomb down to the entrance and they'll all run out to see it like gather around the bomb and then I blow the bomb up.

748
00:50:25,344 --> 00:50:27,714
Rym: yep you can do stuff like that.

749
00:50:28,357 --> 00:50:33,658
Rym: in the end it just makes games like fallout feel really sparse and crappy.

750
00:50:33,678 --> 00:50:37,934
Scott: it makes every single-player game like this is not worth playing.

751
00:50:37,974 --> 00:50:38,818
Rym: right a single-player.

752
00:50:38,858 --> 00:50:45,202
Rym: this is set the bar for open-world games in a way that no one has ever even come close before.

753
00:50:45,242 --> 00:50:45,744
Rym: I don't think.

754
00:50:46,326 --> 00:50:47,089
Scott: now there are.

755
00:50:47,109 --> 00:50:47,651
Scott: let's see.

756
00:50:47,953 --> 00:50:48,174
Scott: you know.

757
00:50:48,194 --> 00:50:49,882
Scott: the thing is it's like you know.

758
00:50:49,902 --> 00:50:51,953
Scott: there's just so many good things in the game.

759
00:50:51,973 --> 00:50:57,200
Rym: no one will see them all you can write probably beat the game and miss a full third of what you could have.

760
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:03,487
Scott: right that even though it's not perfect those good things like override all those imperfect parts.

761
00:51:03,527 --> 00:51:03,668
Scott: like.

762
00:51:03,688 --> 00:51:09,852
Scott: you go back and you look at a game like say Mario 64 which like made the 3d platformer playable.

763
00:51:10,334 --> 00:51:14,956
Scott: and now you look at Mario 64 and it's like it has so many problems and it's like it's.

764
00:51:14,976 --> 00:51:19,780
Scott: you know it's finicky and there's some glitches and all this stuff right and this is a lot like.

765
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:26,975
Scott: the same thing is they took you know this kind of game and they're like no we're gonna show you how to do and they showed everyone how to do.

766
00:51:27,477 --> 00:51:35,953
Scott: but you know in the future you're gonna see that like this game you know has its has its problems yeah but I mean all games will have that sure.

767
00:51:35,973 --> 00:51:37,520
Rym: so it also does a really good job.

768
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:42,061
Rym: Super Metroid doesn't with the story in that there aren't a lot of co.

769
00:51:42,201 --> 00:51:43,387
Scott: I forgot about that problem.

770
00:51:43,407 --> 00:51:47,366
Scott: that's the biggest problem in this game is this cutscenes with bad voice acting.

771
00:51:47,407 --> 00:51:48,030
Scott: fuck them to hell.

772
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:51,764
Rym: the voice acting is not great it's atrocious.

773
00:51:51,965 --> 00:51:54,193
Rym: the Japanese voice acting does sound better.

774
00:51:54,213 --> 00:52:01,718
Rym: I haven't heard it but you cannot have Japanese language acting with English subtitles.

775
00:52:03,062 --> 00:52:04,528
Rym: so you got to deal with it.

776
00:52:04,568 --> 00:52:06,095
Rym: but luckily there aren't that many cutscenes.

777
00:52:06,758 --> 00:52:07,120
Scott: there is.

778
00:52:07,884 --> 00:52:08,909
Scott: you haven't gotten a lot of memories.

779
00:52:08,929 --> 00:52:11,827
Scott: there's a cutscene for every fucking memory but there aren't that many memories.

780
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:12,833
Rym: I've gotten most of them.

781
00:52:13,256 --> 00:52:14,422
Scott: there's a lot of freaking cutscenes.

782
00:52:14,523 --> 00:52:15,629
Rym: yeah there's too many.

783
00:52:15,991 --> 00:52:20,739
Rym: compared to the other things I've done in the game there aren't that many cut scenes is annoying though.

784
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,330
Scott: you haven't done all the things I've done when you.

785
00:52:22,410 --> 00:52:24,567
Scott: oh cuz you've only done one great beast I've only done one great.

786
00:52:24,587 --> 00:52:27,400
Scott: there's like multiple cutscenes per great beast.

787
00:52:27,882 --> 00:52:33,987
Rym: all the cutscenes of the grill of the first great beast I did are my hot shark boyfriend being amazing.

788
00:52:34,148 --> 00:52:38,890
Rym: the other one the other one previous hot shark girlfriend who is now dead being amazing.

789
00:52:39,071 --> 00:52:42,084
Scott: all the cutscenes for the I've done the bird and the camel.

790
00:52:42,164 --> 00:52:44,495
Scott: yeah I haven't gone to Goron land yet.

791
00:52:44,636 --> 00:52:47,330
Rym: I think that's I'm near the Goron land right now I'm not.

792
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:49,138
Scott: I'm gonna go on land last.

793
00:52:49,278 --> 00:52:57,260
Scott: I'm just gonna do every other land and then once I'm completely cleaned out every other land I'll go to Goron land because it's got to be like tons of stuff in Goron land.

794
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:00,035
Rym: right I think I'm doing Gerudo next because that's the area.

795
00:53:00,075 --> 00:53:00,578
Rym: camel land.

796
00:53:00,638 --> 00:53:03,071
Rym: I've been poking around Gerudo it's a camel land.

797
00:53:03,091 --> 00:53:04,278
Rym: I've been poking around in that area.

798
00:53:04,439 --> 00:53:05,204
Scott: yeah it's a good area.

799
00:53:05,626 --> 00:53:08,947
Scott: I think that's the area I've cleaned out the most like because I didn't.

800
00:53:09,088 --> 00:53:10,416
Scott: it's so annoying to go in the desert.

801
00:53:10,436 --> 00:53:12,587
Scott: mmm I don't my horses are like hello.

802
00:53:12,728 --> 00:53:17,495
Scott: I don't want to say I have a hundred percent cleaned it out but I feel like I've done like so many quests there.

803
00:53:17,535 --> 00:53:21,316
Scott: there's almost nothing left for me to do there except probably a million Korok seeds.

804
00:53:21,437 --> 00:53:23,107
Scott: yeah maybe a shrine or two who knows?

805
00:53:23,127 --> 00:53:27,170
Scott: I don't feel I'd be very surprised if there's more than like two or three shrines there.

806
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:28,535
Scott: that I haven't gotten anyway.

807
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:39,114
Scott: but the story great beast the main four plot areas of the game have so much cutscene stuff and it's kind of annoying with the bad voice acting.

808
00:53:39,275 --> 00:53:44,561
Rym: yeah but if there weren't the voice acting they're not that bad because they are relatively short right.

809
00:53:45,143 --> 00:53:50,132
Scott: one interesting Zelda thing in this game is that in other Zelda games the Triforce is like all up in right.

810
00:53:50,152 --> 00:53:52,087
Scott: they're like Triforce, Triforce, Triforce, Triforce, Triforce.

811
00:53:52,127 --> 00:53:53,875
Rym: This one's definitely Triforce.

812
00:53:53,995 --> 00:53:59,819
Scott: No one has mentioned the Triforce at all right even though it's obvious to anyone who's played Zelda before.

813
00:53:59,879 --> 00:54:02,734
Scott: I've seen the Triforce only on a few things.

814
00:54:02,754 --> 00:54:06,212
Scott: there's like one spot in the game where it's on the ground on a plaque or something.

815
00:54:06,232 --> 00:54:07,519
Rym: And there's those three dragons.

816
00:54:07,861 --> 00:54:08,082
Scott: right.

817
00:54:08,102 --> 00:54:10,836
Rym: so the three dragons and the three shrines or what not the shrines.

818
00:54:10,856 --> 00:54:12,624
Rym: so three power whatever right.

819
00:54:12,644 --> 00:54:15,439
Scott: so nobody has told enemy about the dragons.

820
00:54:15,479 --> 00:54:23,356
Scott: but you'll be playing and you'll just see this freaking long ass Chinese dragon up in the sky making noise doing a thing and you're just like whoa.

821
00:54:23,437 --> 00:54:26,250
Rym: I'm going to hide behind this tree until that is gone.

822
00:54:26,411 --> 00:54:27,094
Scott: gives you like this.

823
00:54:27,174 --> 00:54:29,164
Scott: you know that mystical kind of like.

824
00:54:29,305 --> 00:54:29,989
Scott: what is that?

825
00:54:30,009 --> 00:54:31,416
Scott: no one even told me about that.

826
00:54:31,436 --> 00:54:36,421
Scott: but that's a thing I want to explore kind of feeling and the game rewards you for exploring.

827
00:54:36,682 --> 00:54:40,079
Scott: you know cool stuff that you just see that no one even told you about is just there.

828
00:54:40,722 --> 00:54:41,848
Scott: but there's three dragons.

829
00:54:41,868 --> 00:54:44,585
Scott: one of them is power one of them's courage and one of those wisdom.

830
00:54:44,646 --> 00:54:46,074
Scott: they obviously go with the Triforce.

831
00:54:46,496 --> 00:54:48,927
Scott: and there's three shrines power courage and wisdom.

832
00:54:48,947 --> 00:54:52,119
Scott: and you have to offer a scale to each shrine.

833
00:54:52,139 --> 00:54:56,434
Scott: I did the wisdom one which the dragon was at the shrine.

834
00:54:56,474 --> 00:54:58,041
Scott: it's like it's set up for you to be easy.

835
00:54:58,062 --> 00:55:15,176
Scott: and but it wasn't easy to be that dragon anyway and I put the shrine in there I put the scale in the shrine I found the power shrine and I've seen the power dragon in the sky but I have no idea how to get to the dragon or get a scale from it and I don't know where the courage shrine is.

836
00:55:15,236 --> 00:55:24,737
Scott: though I can guess and I've seen the courage dragon but I have no idea where the courage shrine is or how to get the scale from the dragon.

837
00:55:24,777 --> 00:55:27,030
Scott: you see you mess with the dragon is if I can destroys you.

838
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:36,924
Rym: so last night I was it was night again and I was like wandering around on the edge of this cliff just in an area and I saw a shooting star like huh and then it came down and crashed way off in the distance.

839
00:55:36,964 --> 00:55:40,886
Scott: I've seen his shooting star in the distance but I couldn't make it there because dangerous stuff.

840
00:55:40,906 --> 00:55:43,538
Rym: yep I saw it crash and I was like whoa.

841
00:55:43,578 --> 00:55:50,771
Rym: so I put it like a beacon pin in it and I started heading that way and I couldn't figure out a way to get where it landed and I gave up.

842
00:55:50,912 --> 00:55:53,381
Scott: I couldn't get where it landed cuz I was murdered by lasers.

843
00:55:53,401 --> 00:55:56,254
Scott: I haven't seen another one.

844
00:55:56,274 --> 00:55:57,501
Rym: yeah I've one place.

845
00:55:57,521 --> 00:55:59,592
Rym: I thought oh I'll just I'll fly down into this area.

846
00:55:59,613 --> 00:56:02,389
Rym: so I'm flying down flying down flying down and I hear the noise.

847
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:07,496
Rym: if there's a guardian I figure okay I'll do the thing where I like drop kite drop kite and they'll usually miss me.

848
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:10,227
Rym: and then like five more lasers.

849
00:56:10,328 --> 00:56:14,423
Rym: I literally had six of those lines like all pointed at me.

850
00:56:14,443 --> 00:56:18,058
Rym: yeah and I was like well let's just teleport back to a safe place.

851
00:56:18,158 --> 00:56:18,500
Scott: yeah.

852
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:21,315
Scott: so examples of annoying things that have happened right.

853
00:56:21,335 --> 00:56:23,733
Scott: so I was riding a horse and trying to get away from some Guardians.

854
00:56:23,773 --> 00:56:27,172
Scott: yeah and I'm like whipping the horse and then the horse just stops didn't?

855
00:56:27,192 --> 00:56:29,383
Rym: did you run the horse out of the horse?

856
00:56:29,444 --> 00:56:29,986
Scott: still shouldn't?

857
00:56:30,027 --> 00:56:30,147
Scott: just?

858
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:32,560
Scott: I mean I'm okay if it threw me off and kept running.

859
00:56:32,901 --> 00:56:33,826
Scott: right that makes sense.

860
00:56:34,148 --> 00:56:37,764
Scott: a horse just stopping when someone's shooting lasers at it and it's on fire.

861
00:56:37,864 --> 00:56:41,200
Scott: one thing a horse on fire should keep running like holy shit.

862
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:42,225
Scott: my ass is on fire.

863
00:56:42,526 --> 00:56:45,219
Scott: throw me off I don't care but it stopped.

864
00:56:45,259 --> 00:56:49,485
Scott: and because it stopped if it threw me off I wouldn't have died because I would have been able to like get up and run.

865
00:56:49,526 --> 00:56:53,349
Rym: problem is you're trying to run this horse to death and the horses I'm getting shot at by lasers.

866
00:56:53,611 --> 00:56:58,843
Rym: the horse was like you know what if I just stand here this motherfucker on my back will die and then I get to go home and eat my own.

867
00:56:58,863 --> 00:57:01,840
Rym: no the horse died and I ran away and horses actually die.

868
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:02,725
Rym: I've never seen a horse.

869
00:57:02,786 --> 00:57:05,719
Scott: yeah you got shot by lasers didn't burn to death it died.

870
00:57:05,739 --> 00:57:06,704
Scott: it was stupid.

871
00:57:06,764 --> 00:57:07,326
Scott: or is that you know?

872
00:57:07,346 --> 00:57:11,407
Scott: they have all these systems that you see so many times that are so intelligent.

873
00:57:11,709 --> 00:57:13,076
Scott: that system was not intelligent.

874
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:14,864
Rym: maybe that horse just wasn't intelligent.

875
00:57:15,025 --> 00:57:16,391
Scott: no I got a horse.

876
00:57:16,472 --> 00:57:22,923
Rym: now it's uh it's not like the special horse but this horse I have a special but there are other special or fast.

877
00:57:23,265 --> 00:57:23,707
Scott: yeah I have the.

878
00:57:23,727 --> 00:57:26,703
Scott: I have the white horse Zelt the grandchild of Zelda's horse.

879
00:57:26,844 --> 00:57:27,527
Scott: it's the fastest.

880
00:57:27,608 --> 00:57:28,452
Rym: I do not have that horse.

881
00:57:28,493 --> 00:57:29,398
Rym: I just have some random horse.

882
00:57:29,438 --> 00:57:31,108
Rym: I found that is just wicked fast.

883
00:57:31,289 --> 00:57:34,164
Rym: yeah and I have another horse that I stole from some Bokoblin.

884
00:57:34,406 --> 00:57:35,673
Scott: another thing about horses.

885
00:57:35,713 --> 00:57:36,619
Scott: so there's a horse race.

886
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:37,586
Scott: you probably haven't gotten there.

887
00:57:37,667 --> 00:57:38,673
Rym: I got the horse race.

888
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:40,828
Scott: it's one of those things you to jump over a bunch of sticks.

889
00:57:40,888 --> 00:57:41,894
Rym: I beat the shit out of that.

890
00:57:41,914 --> 00:57:42,557
Rym: that was so easy.

891
00:57:42,698 --> 00:57:46,958
Scott: I tried to do it and my fucking horse like I'm aimed at the stick dead-on.

892
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:48,204
Rym: how fast are you going?

893
00:57:48,244 --> 00:57:49,309
Scott: I was going way fast.

894
00:57:49,350 --> 00:57:50,515
Scott: it was the white Zelda horse.

895
00:57:50,837 --> 00:57:54,293
Scott: oh and he just gets up to the stick and just stops but he balked.

896
00:57:55,016 --> 00:57:56,843
Scott: that happens every single time.

897
00:57:56,863 --> 00:57:57,807
Rym: maybe you can't.

898
00:57:57,828 --> 00:57:59,315
Rym: maybe he doesn't like to race pick a different horse.

899
00:57:59,697 --> 00:58:00,783
Scott: I'm just saying it's like that's.

900
00:58:00,924 --> 00:58:03,176
Rym: I beat that race my first time.

901
00:58:03,356 --> 00:58:08,765
Scott: I did multiple tries and didn't beat it even though I had built the skill to do it and I felt like I was doing nothing wrong.

902
00:58:09,047 --> 00:58:12,001
Scott: just the horse was doing perfectly up until this one stick.

903
00:58:12,041 --> 00:58:14,595
Scott: for some reason it always stopped on that stick.

904
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:15,725
Rym: I think you're doing something wrong.

905
00:58:15,745 --> 00:58:17,235
Scott: there was something wrong with lesson.

906
00:58:17,356 --> 00:58:19,809
Scott: there was something wrong with the like something messed up.

907
00:58:20,232 --> 00:58:21,078
Scott: I don't know what the hell.

908
00:58:21,098 --> 00:58:22,085
Rym: I think you're just doing it wrong.

909
00:58:22,105 --> 00:58:24,376
Scott: go watch on the twitch VOD of like.

910
00:58:24,457 --> 00:58:27,269
Rym: what well what I was doing and see what happened.

911
00:58:27,309 --> 00:58:36,213
Scott: so many fucking tries on this stupid thing and at first I was messing up but eventually I figured it out and just for some reason it just bullshitted me on this one spot.

912
00:58:36,574 --> 00:58:38,522
Rym: yeah I found that horse race to be really easy.

913
00:58:38,542 --> 00:58:40,369
Scott: I felt way easy.

914
00:58:40,429 --> 00:58:41,876
Scott: it felt like I was doing everything right.

915
00:58:41,956 --> 00:58:42,499
Scott: I mean it.

916
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:43,665
Scott: so it was right way.

917
00:58:43,906 --> 00:58:47,250
Scott: I think it's something maybe a different horse I don't know but it was just fucking bull.

918
00:58:47,531 --> 00:58:48,818
Scott: yeah fucking bullshit there.

919
00:58:48,838 --> 00:58:50,084
Scott: so I was fucked up.

920
00:58:50,265 --> 00:59:01,187
Rym: but in terms of the story aside from the voice acting I like the fact that the story itself is actually I'm a different horse race pretty sparse in that you way.

921
00:59:01,227 --> 00:59:10,060
Rym: I mean it's a you know technology post-apocalyptic world all that stuff and you basically don't really remember shit which works.

922
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:13,900
Rym: from a storytelling standpoint it's very easy because you don't know what's going on.

923
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:17,384
Scott: so that doesn't need to have a lot of story right you know it's like you plays all the one.

924
00:59:17,404 --> 00:59:21,066
Scott: the story is in the instruction manual and at the end of the game and nowhere in between.

925
00:59:21,086 --> 00:59:26,680
Scott: I actually think that the story parts actually kind of bother me mostly because it's bad voice acting other than the voice I can.

926
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:29,475
Rym: I do like the story because it's it's it hints at this.

927
00:59:29,495 --> 00:59:31,507
Rym: you know the long arc of Zelda and how.

928
00:59:31,547 --> 00:59:38,960
Rym: there was a lot of era mm-hmm and then there was the normal era and you live in the post-apocalyptic yeah again and won that last war era.

929
00:59:39,121 --> 00:59:40,948
Scott: yep I like this.

930
00:59:41,048 --> 00:59:46,654
Scott: I like the small stories right like in the town like there's a story of this one person in their deal.

931
00:59:46,674 --> 00:59:48,866
Scott: the big story I don't really care so much.

932
00:59:48,886 --> 00:59:50,878
Scott: those characters are like except shark man.

933
00:59:51,019 --> 00:59:54,696
Rym: I'm pretty invested in the shark fan except like even Zelda Zelda is so annoying.

934
00:59:54,756 --> 01:00:07,277
Scott: I'm like excuse me princess reminds me a little bit of princess bubblegum and that this cell he's definitely trying to be princess bubblegum but she's her personality is unpleasant and like oh my god she's a little more.

935
01:00:07,357 --> 01:00:13,187
Rym: I like how there isn't really at least as far as I've run into much implied romance between Lincoln's.

936
01:00:13,228 --> 01:00:14,172
Rym: all that I kind of like that.

937
01:00:14,775 --> 01:00:18,250
Scott: I like how there was never implied romance before too much either.

938
01:00:18,411 --> 01:00:21,727
Rym: yeah well excuse me there was a lot of romance in the cartoon.

939
01:00:21,747 --> 01:00:25,062
Scott: the cartoon there was sure yeah and in general fan.

940
01:00:25,082 --> 01:00:26,629
Scott: but in the games it's just like you know.

941
01:00:26,849 --> 01:00:30,510
Scott: it's like you sort of assume that just because that's the way human brains are.

942
01:00:30,590 --> 01:00:37,639
Scott: but it's like hey I don't remember them ever kissing or having the same bedroom or doing any you know.

943
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:41,257
Rym: but I like the fact like for example Miffa you know your dead shark girlfriend mm-hmm.

944
01:00:41,659 --> 01:00:46,324
Rym: she like you like you've ever run into humans in the game and they don't know the fuck you are.

945
01:00:46,385 --> 01:00:48,075
Rym: cuz you you're from a hundred years ago.

946
01:00:48,095 --> 01:00:49,705
Scott: well I have the Master Sword so some of it.

947
01:00:49,725 --> 01:00:51,757
Scott: there's one person who's like oh you are the hero.

948
01:00:51,777 --> 01:00:52,702
Scott: you have the Master Sword.

949
01:00:53,306 --> 01:00:59,335
Scott: there are other people someone I met who was like yeah there was a hero who had this Master Sword a long time ago.

950
01:00:59,355 --> 01:01:00,583
Scott: I wonder if I've ever seen him again.

951
01:01:00,623 --> 01:01:01,026
Scott: I'm like here.

952
01:01:01,187 --> 01:01:02,011
Scott: let me show it to you.

953
01:01:02,031 --> 01:01:11,719
Rym: well highly and any Hylian you meet pretty much who isn't old definitely has no idea who you are or if they know who you are they were not around when you were around last time.

954
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:13,088
Scott: yeah you've been asleep for a hundred years.

955
01:01:13,129 --> 01:01:13,933
Rym: kids don't care at all.

956
01:01:13,974 --> 01:01:14,698
Rym: kids are just like.

957
01:01:14,939 --> 01:01:19,180
Rym: they just ignore you or that one kid shows you the dark god that he's friends with.

958
01:01:19,943 --> 01:01:20,867
Rym: I like that kid a lot.

959
01:01:21,168 --> 01:01:22,595
Rym: hey mister you want to meet my friend.

960
01:01:22,735 --> 01:01:28,063
Scott: the point is if you need you know I mean this game is so enormous and there's so much stuff in it.

961
01:01:28,123 --> 01:01:32,763
Scott: like if you are a person who plays video games and nervous dad it's must play.

962
01:01:32,944 --> 01:01:42,968
Scott: it's like every other game you know compared to this is like oh if you every night you can't be as good as this with your single-player triple-a game don't even publish it every

963
01:01:43,028 --> 01:01:49,821
Rym: negative I can come up with about this game is outweighed by the fact that I like this game enough to wear instead of teleporting.

964
01:01:49,862 --> 01:01:52,856
Rym: sometimes I ride my horse anyway because it's pleasant.

965
01:01:52,996 --> 01:01:55,065
Scott: I actually stopped riding horses.

966
01:01:55,106 --> 01:01:55,668
Scott: I'm just walking.

967
01:01:55,688 --> 01:01:58,060
Scott: I got so much stamina now it doesn't really matter.

968
01:01:58,281 --> 01:02:02,164
Rym: I like the horse riding because they will just follow a road and I'm kind of scanning.

969
01:02:02,204 --> 01:02:11,593
Scott: yeah the thing with the horse riding is that like I miss small stuff when I'm riding the horses going from place to place real fast right I teleport and walk everywhere I do apply.

970
01:02:11,754 --> 01:02:16,440
Rym: I fly most of my early upgrades which is part of why I don't have the Master Sword yet because I haven't.

971
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:18,777
Rym: I didn't go to the Dark God to swap everybody the Dark God.

972
01:02:18,817 --> 01:02:20,348
Rym: yeah I'll just get more hearts it's worth.

973
01:02:20,368 --> 01:02:22,379
Scott: but I got a lot of takes a long time to get that many hearts.

974
01:02:22,439 --> 01:02:29,990
Rym: I got a lot of stamina first so I in the early game I could climb and fly to a lot of really dangerous places.

975
01:02:30,633 --> 01:02:33,485
Rym: so I snuck into some towers like when you first see a wiz robe.

976
01:02:34,249 --> 01:02:35,858
Rym: they're like magic man from Adventure Time.

977
01:02:35,898 --> 01:02:37,488
Rym: they're terrifying and free.

978
01:02:37,508 --> 01:02:38,574
Scott: yeah they're not scaring me now.

979
01:02:38,674 --> 01:02:42,895
Rym: no now I can just like arrow them to death if I want yep but yeah the game that.

980
01:02:42,915 --> 01:02:50,015
Scott: the one last thing is the game is so many callbacks to old Zelda's that if you haven't played the old Zelda's you won't get them but they're so unnecessary.

981
01:02:50,055 --> 01:02:57,507
Scott: huh I mean it's not necessary to get them yeah but because I played almost every single player Zelda there is to completion.

982
01:02:57,527 --> 01:03:00,304
Scott: I see all these things and they're so awesome.

983
01:03:00,324 --> 01:03:01,572
Scott: it's like getting the Master Sword.

984
01:03:01,592 --> 01:03:02,477
Scott: you need 13 hearts.

985
01:03:02,578 --> 01:03:04,589
Scott: nope you need 13 hearts to get the magic sword.

986
01:03:04,609 --> 01:03:07,003
Scott: in Zelda 1. the old man won't let you take it.

987
01:03:07,023 --> 01:03:08,753
Scott: unless you have that many heart master you're using it.

988
01:03:08,773 --> 01:03:09,898
Rym: I can have this right.

989
01:03:10,239 --> 01:03:10,822
Scott: there is.

990
01:03:10,842 --> 01:03:22,836
Scott: in Zelda 1 the end of the game is inside of the left rock of spectacle rock which plays with two mountains and in this game there's a place called spectacle rock on the map with two mountains and it's just like.

991
01:03:22,856 --> 01:03:24,864
Scott: there's so many things.

992
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:28,784
Rym: the woods is just a straight-up lost woods like figure out the maze right.

993
01:03:28,824 --> 01:03:43,350
Scott: there's so many things that are just from old Zelda games that have been just upgraded and inserted into this Zelda game especially Zelda 1 the other open-world Zelda that if you know those things it's like even though even the most dangerous guy but the line.

994
01:03:43,370 --> 01:03:46,564
Scott: now is the most dangerous guy from Zelda 1 the line?

995
01:03:46,604 --> 01:03:52,398
Scott: now it's the same guy a centaur with a sword who shoots things that you think the most dangerous guys tell the one is blue his robe.

996
01:03:52,418 --> 01:03:54,770
Scott: no blue his robe is not as dangerous as line.

997
01:03:54,931 --> 01:03:56,980
Rym: those were real easy to kill if you had a shield.

998
01:03:58,044 --> 01:04:02,965
Rym: so real dangerous if there was a lot of them plus dark knots were way harder to kill than Lionel's.

999
01:04:03,748 --> 01:04:04,934
Scott: Lionel did way more damage.

1000
01:04:04,955 --> 01:04:05,598
Scott: you would mess you up.

1001
01:04:05,619 --> 01:04:07,087
Rym: don't get hit by him jeez.

1002
01:04:07,128 --> 01:04:10,038
Scott: they're tough especially this via screen just full of line up.

1003
01:04:10,078 --> 01:04:14,333
Rym: yeah I cannot recommend this game enough.

1004
01:04:14,574 --> 01:04:17,446
Scott: yeah I mean you know a switch is out now.

1005
01:04:17,466 --> 01:04:23,598
Rym: I mean we could probably we could literally probably do a Zelda only show the switch factor right with the portableness.

1006
01:04:23,678 --> 01:04:24,945
Scott: it's like how can you not?

1007
01:04:25,106 --> 01:04:34,820
Scott: yeah like I'm going to count in a few weeks I'm just gonna play Zelda and if you train if you're not buying a switch if you're one of those people who accidentally bought a Wii U spy this game you can buy the game for Wii U.

1008
01:04:35,081 --> 01:04:36,426
Rym: yeah cuz.

1009
01:04:36,467 --> 01:04:38,938
Rym: then I mean no there aren't other switch games.

1010
01:04:38,998 --> 01:04:39,962
Scott: I mean worth playing.

1011
01:04:40,003 --> 01:04:51,796
Scott: you probably spent as much money on steam games you aren't playing as you would pay to get a switch and this game and you're actually gonna play that if you buy it like all the steam games you bought for the same amount of money.

1012
01:04:52,238 --> 01:04:53,123
Scott: so just do it.

1013
01:04:53,384 --> 01:04:57,342
Rym: yep but like we could literally probably do weeks and weeks of shows.

1014
01:04:57,423 --> 01:04:58,306
Rym: just about Zelda.

1015
01:04:58,367 --> 01:04:59,873
Scott: it's so big I can just talk forever.

1016
01:05:00,094 --> 01:05:04,313
Scott: yeah which is how every game every single player game you know to be worth.

1017
01:05:04,353 --> 01:05:05,458
Rym: what can I say about Fallout 3?

1018
01:05:05,458 --> 01:05:13,333
Scott: for me to spend $50 and that much of my life on a game it should be so big that I can't I can talk about it for hours.

1019
01:05:13,393 --> 01:05:14,900
Scott: otherwise why is it even worth playing?

1020
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:18,017
Rym: beat fallout 3 that giant you know quote-unquote open-world.

1021
01:05:18,399 --> 01:05:25,661
Rym: and the only thing I really would say that was interesting was the end was dumb because the one you could have said a robot in or the one guy was already radioactive immune.

1022
01:05:25,722 --> 01:05:27,108
Rym: so like it didn't make sense.

1023
01:05:27,229 --> 01:05:29,540
Rym: yeah I don't have any interesting stories.

1024
01:05:30,002 --> 01:05:32,472
