00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:13,333
Rym: It's Monday April 17th 2017.

2
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:13,795
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,136 --> 00:00:16,283
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:16,303 --> 00:00:18,510
Rym: We're talking about PC cooling.

5
00:00:21,632 --> 00:00:29,763
Scott: Let's do this Alright, so remember when I was like man.

6
00:00:29,803 --> 00:00:31,330
Scott: my computer keeps having these blue screens.

7
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:32,475
Scott: I'm gonna play I can't?

8
00:00:32,534 --> 00:00:34,202
Scott: I gotta find a replacement motherboard.

9
00:00:34,222 --> 00:00:35,929
Scott: I remember remember that.

10
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:42,467
Scott: So I replaced that motherboard and it totally worked Until until stop working.

11
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:43,752
Scott: No, it didn't stop working.

12
00:00:43,892 --> 00:00:44,756
Scott: It's just like the computer.

13
00:00:44,776 --> 00:00:45,760
Scott: still it's like it's weird.

14
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,255
Scott: The computer works perfectly and just blue screens randomly and it's not it.

15
00:00:50,556 --> 00:00:54,094
Scott: the blue screen message Every time is a different.

16
00:00:54,194 --> 00:00:54,860
Scott: one is different.

17
00:00:55,323 --> 00:00:58,120
Scott: So it's like you google all these different ones and you keep getting answers.

18
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:09,167
Scott: It's like none of these are what I have and you google and it's like I keep getting a bunch of different blue screen messages and that doesn't help you either right, I'd still guess either motherboard or Probably mother.

19
00:01:09,247 --> 00:01:10,740
Scott: is it the second motherboard?

20
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,845
Rym: Well, you gotta use motherboard.

21
00:01:12,905 --> 00:01:17,600
Rym: the blue screen and motherboard itself might have a congenital defect the effect of the womb.

22
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,210
Scott: So the blue screening waxes and wanes, right?

23
00:01:20,451 --> 00:01:22,840
Rym: Well based on what I don't know, huh?

24
00:01:22,981 --> 00:01:24,126
Scott: It just waxes and wanes.

25
00:01:24,227 --> 00:01:25,895
Rym: Anyway, so I don't know what you're from.

26
00:01:25,935 --> 00:01:26,820
Rym: I don't have these problems.

27
00:01:27,243 --> 00:01:28,774
Scott: I just read that's a hardware problem.

28
00:01:28,794 --> 00:01:29,016
Scott: It's not.

29
00:01:29,096 --> 00:01:30,527
Scott: I'm saying I Did.

30
00:01:30,709 --> 00:01:32,080
Rym: I have not had problems like this?

31
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,076
Rym: There must be something wrong with something you did and wrong with some hardware.

32
00:01:35,117 --> 00:01:35,338
Scott: Nothing.

33
00:01:35,378 --> 00:01:35,639
Scott: I did.

34
00:01:36,842 --> 00:01:38,113
Scott: Hardware problem happens to anybody.

35
00:01:38,194 --> 00:01:45,700
Scott: so Yeah, cuz the things that I complain about other people doing is like they fuck up their own shit like oh you installed that malware.

36
00:01:45,881 --> 00:01:47,367
Scott: Oh you installed that shitty program.

37
00:01:47,587 --> 00:01:48,852
Scott: Oh you you you're complaining.

38
00:01:48,873 --> 00:01:50,720
Scott: your phone is broken, but you jail broke it.

39
00:01:50,881 --> 00:01:51,764
Scott: Why are you complaining?

40
00:01:51,784 --> 00:01:54,034
Scott: I don't tell people when they have a hardware problem.

41
00:01:54,075 --> 00:01:57,626
Scott: I don't get on the case Hardware breaks sometimes.

42
00:01:57,646 --> 00:01:59,113
Rym: maybe it's just time to buy a new computer.

43
00:01:59,294 --> 00:02:00,420
Rym: No, even though you wanted to wait.

44
00:02:00,602 --> 00:02:01,940
Scott: No, I don't want to buy a new computer.

45
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:06,840
Scott: So I'm like, well, I did a RAM test again of like the tenth time and it says your RAM is a-ok.

46
00:02:07,101 --> 00:02:07,504
Scott: So I'm not.

47
00:02:07,524 --> 00:02:11,707
Scott: I didn't even try removing RAM sticks or anything Even though that seems like it's what it should be right.

48
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:20,047
Scott: and I figure well if the CPUs busted I'm buying a new computer right, so so It's only that computer right?

49
00:02:20,328 --> 00:02:35,560
Scott: Yes, because a thing my new Htbc is so perfect and I think it is never because a thing that could crashed or failed in any way It is the most solid computer since my high energy ionizing radiation could cause single bit errors.

50
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:37,920
Rym: That would lead to crashes that frequently anyway.

51
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:41,436
Rym: Well, I mean if there was a high rate it like a high source of radiation like.

52
00:02:41,476 --> 00:02:42,420
Rym: so I thought your apartment.

53
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,748
Scott: So obviously blue screens are mostly caused by driver situations, right?

54
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:50,280
Scott: So I thought maybe my Nvidia, you know card would be bad.

55
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,920
Scott: Maybe I'll try to use my you know, the built-in card on the motherboard and just take the Nvidia card.

56
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,338
Rym: That's actually a pretty good test.

57
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,676
Scott: But you know, I figure I just updated the Nvidia driver and that didn't have an effect.

58
00:03:01,717 --> 00:03:05,680
Scott: so it's like well I don't really want to not have maybe the video card.

59
00:03:05,821 --> 00:03:08,960
Scott: I don't want to go down to one monitor and have no GPU, right?

60
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,999
Rym: So in fact, I wouldn't be super surprised about something weird like the video card putting stress on the PSU.

61
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:17,099
Scott: Anyway, I'll do that if I have to write it's not a PSU from.

62
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,604
Rym: so Have you done voltage test?

63
00:03:19,644 --> 00:03:24,380
Scott: you sure if it was a PSU problem the computer would turn off and not blue screen.

64
00:03:24,781 --> 00:03:35,820
Scott: It depends anyway, so I go online, you know, I start researching some of the different blue screen messages Right, and one of them, you know, basically a lot of them were clearly not what was wrong with me?

65
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,110
Scott: Yeah, they were like, oh your RAM is busted.

66
00:03:38,131 --> 00:03:39,095
Scott: I'm like, nope, that's not me.

67
00:03:39,115 --> 00:03:40,120
Scott: They're like, oh you got a malware.

68
00:03:40,181 --> 00:03:41,198
Scott: I'm like, nope, that's not me.

69
00:03:42,561 --> 00:03:52,955
Scott: but one of them was like yeah when Windows 10 was brand new there was some problem with this SATA driver and You know, it got fixed in a way in a later Windows update.

70
00:03:53,277 --> 00:04:05,051
Rym: and I'm like Okay So does your motherboard like a lot of old motherboards have the regular SATA driver and then the other SATA chip to give you The newer motherboard?

71
00:04:05,091 --> 00:04:10,289
Scott: just is all Intel everything okay, so but anyways cuz I had that problem once with an 8-bit motherboard and it was the.

72
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:15,929
Rym: there was the normal chipset that gave me like for my And then there was this other chipsets.

73
00:04:16,009 --> 00:04:18,959
Scott: obviously my windows 10 is updated so that's not the problem.

74
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,470
Scott: The problem is not an out-of-date driver.

75
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,039
Scott: Yeah, but I was like, huh?

76
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:28,952
Scott: That's weird though that You know that could cause a blue screen even though it's like storage related.

77
00:04:28,972 --> 00:04:31,620
Scott: you figure when storage fails you just get failing storage.

78
00:04:32,661 --> 00:04:34,005
Scott: So I figured huh?

79
00:04:34,045 --> 00:04:36,613
Scott: Well about you know, there's a harmless process of elimination.

80
00:04:36,633 --> 00:04:38,980
Scott: I got that really old SSD in there.

81
00:04:39,806 --> 00:04:40,734
Scott: I'm just gonna unplug it.

82
00:04:42,023 --> 00:04:43,532
Scott: I'll just unplug the old SSD.

83
00:04:43,834 --> 00:04:48,520
Scott: You know, I only for storage I only use it for swap when I'm for scratch space in Adobe.

84
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,036
Rym: I don't use it for anything else just scratch space or also like Windows swap.

85
00:04:52,257 --> 00:04:53,040
Scott: No only scratch.

86
00:04:53,844 --> 00:04:55,331
Scott: So I don't use it for literally anything.

87
00:04:55,351 --> 00:04:57,180
Scott: So I'm like, I'll just unplug that and see what happens.

88
00:04:58,002 --> 00:05:00,338
Scott: There hasn't been a blue screen since I am play, huh?

89
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:07,289
Scott: And I'm like really an SSD can cause blue screens like that and I don't know for sure because it hasn't been long enough To you know, I could you know.

90
00:05:07,329 --> 00:05:08,780
Scott: next step is removing the video card.

91
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,871
Rym: That is the problem with that sort of intermittent hardware.

92
00:05:10,891 --> 00:05:14,607
Rym: problem is that unless you have Multiple copies of the same hardware.

93
00:05:14,627 --> 00:05:17,480
Rym: There's really no way to like test it to figure it out.

94
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:22,558
Scott: So if the blue screen happens again hard drives going back in video cards coming out.

95
00:05:24,342 --> 00:05:26,999
Rym: But if it never happens again, you still don't know for sure if that was it.

96
00:05:27,283 --> 00:05:28,943
Scott: Oh, no, if it never happens again I'll be confident.

97
00:05:28,963 --> 00:05:32,040
Scott: was that I was that SSD and I bought in your motherboard for nothing.

98
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:38,364
Rym: But eh, whatever the worst case would be if it doesn't happen for a while and then it happens once Happens like I run.

99
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:42,200
Scott: I read I first I got tried reinstalling Windows and it didn't happen for a long.

100
00:05:42,923 --> 00:05:44,491
Scott: And then it happened and I'm like what the fuck.

101
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:46,480
Rym: so with the computer.

102
00:05:47,201 --> 00:05:57,410
Rym: Two or three computers ago that I used to do use like resound and GeekNights like in the old days with Gen 2 It would blue screen Occasionally and I figured out there's a bunch of different causes.

103
00:05:57,511 --> 00:05:58,134
Rym: that were they were all.

104
00:05:58,154 --> 00:05:59,540
Rym: basically there are multiple things causing it.

105
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:07,580
Rym: One of them was the USBs on the case had subtle shorts And when I unplugged them they stopped happening.

106
00:06:08,022 --> 00:06:16,129
Rym: but they then they started happening again less frequently with a different set of error codes and I eventually narrowed that one down to.

107
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:31,608
Rym: if I ever let the computer hibernate or go to sleep Then I would have blue screens and when I disabled all that stuff and powered it down every day before I went to work and only Powered it up and when I was home never blue screened again Unless I plugged in those USBs.

108
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:34,578
Scott: No, I'll probably buy a new computer and next to you.

109
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:41,659
Scott: Yeah Like a 1180 if you can hold everyone else in the 1080s I'd be like, haha 1180 what you could do about it?

110
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:45,720
Rym: Like if you're gonna buy a computer like we're in this great plateau time to buy one.

111
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:50,080
Rym: But if you can hold out like another six months or a year, you're gonna get another generational.

112
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:53,153
Scott: Yeah, I mean there's no you know, my computer power wise just fun.

113
00:06:53,253 --> 00:06:54,760
Rym: Yeah, mine was not power wise.

114
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,969
Rym: That's why I got the new one And I so I did a test of a pipeline.

115
00:06:58,029 --> 00:07:00,278
Rym: cuz you know that old advance war show I did a few times.

116
00:07:00,338 --> 00:07:01,062
Rym: people really Liked it.

117
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:02,210
Rym: people keep watching it.

118
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,680
Rym: There's like tons of views on those old videos.

119
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,204
Scott: There's no other advances content.

120
00:07:05,364 --> 00:07:12,835
Rym: the my old CPU was literally not fast enough to fully run the DS emulators out there.

121
00:07:13,963 --> 00:07:17,200
Rym: So it would like run slow and cause problems.

122
00:07:17,621 --> 00:07:18,784
Rym: So I tested all that on.

123
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:26,146
Rym: the new computer works like a champ and I turned on the ultra high quality sound processing Including the weird stuff 100%.

124
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:28,995
Rym: it just maxes out one of my cores and everything's fine.

125
00:07:29,376 --> 00:07:30,760
Rym: So I'm gonna start doing the advanced war show.

126
00:07:30,801 --> 00:07:37,232
Rym: I think Yeah, you got any news On this Monday this tech news day.

127
00:07:37,252 --> 00:07:38,237
Scott: I do have a news.

128
00:07:38,318 --> 00:07:43,898
Scott: so You know Apple Apple made some sort of recent more announcement of.

129
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:46,388
Scott: we're like, yeah We're actually gonna do Mac Pro.

130
00:07:46,468 --> 00:07:49,540
Scott: We know whatever right but nothing is set in stone for that, right?

131
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,879
Scott: They yeah, they could come out with some more garbage or whatever.

132
00:07:53,302 --> 00:07:56,612
Scott: But basically they admitted like that the Mac the trash can Mac Pro from what?

133
00:07:56,612 --> 00:08:04,828
Scott: 2012 or whatever it was sufficient, you know, they basically designed themselves into a hole where they couldn't like.

134
00:08:05,149 --> 00:08:09,623
Scott: upgrade when you know to newer stuff and it's like Dumb asses.

135
00:08:09,663 --> 00:08:19,820
Scott: just get the best possible hardware the same computer that I would buy today install OS X on it overpriced it by Thousand to two thousand dollars and sell it.

136
00:08:20,568 --> 00:08:21,520
Scott: Everyone will buy it.

137
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,679
Rym: There's a little bit of nuance to that like the big complaints about the newer.

138
00:08:25,244 --> 00:08:27,200
Rym: You can ask book pros not being powerful enough.

139
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:34,063
Rym: We're a little bit complicated because some aspects of them were criminally underpowered but other aspects of them We're not talking about.

140
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:37,618
Scott: we're talking about Mac Pro the desktop thing the MacBook Pro, whatever.

141
00:08:37,638 --> 00:08:48,020
Rym: Yeah But the people who complained about his performance didn't seem to realize that the storage was all PCIe Which is actually like out of the realm of most computer users experience.

142
00:08:48,321 --> 00:09:00,180
Scott: Whatever the point is, you know, the CPUs the GPUs most of all have always been underpowered and max Yeah, but anyway, you know still eat today and whenever Apple even updates it or price still be overpriced garbage, right?

143
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,140
Scott: They don't know how to make a powerful desktop, right?

144
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:12,207
Scott: I'd be very surprised if they succeeded at this even though if they just put me in charge of it Windows would just die on the desktop Because I would just be like, oh here's a $2,000 computer.

145
00:09:12,247 --> 00:09:13,690
Scott: it runs OS X and it's godlike.

146
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:14,964
Scott: Congratulations.

147
00:09:15,024 --> 00:09:16,313
Scott: We now have 100% market share.

148
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:26,757
Scott: That was easy anyway But yeah, so they're gonna fail and people, you know who must keep OS X for whatever reason they just can't Windows They can't bring themselves to Windows and obviously you can't Linux.

149
00:09:29,381 --> 00:09:36,549
Scott: It's true they've been doing hackintoshes more and more and hackintoshing has become more and more like Successful like it works better than it used to.

150
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:38,316
Rym: I mean if you're not still it's still.

151
00:09:38,336 --> 00:09:40,305
Scott: I'm not saying it's smooth It's still hacky.

152
00:09:40,365 --> 00:09:41,450
Scott: It's hackintosh, right?

153
00:09:41,731 --> 00:09:42,113
Scott: It's not.

154
00:09:42,535 --> 00:09:45,280
Scott: Oh perfectly good Macintosh, right It's hackintosh.

155
00:09:45,482 --> 00:09:55,112
Scott: But if you want to do it you can do it like if you don't need to play games and you want a powerful computer and you want to run OS X and You don't want to pay a whole bunch for a shitty computer from Apple.

156
00:09:55,674 --> 00:10:03,975
Scott: You can buy regular parts Just figure out which the right parts beforehand and install OS X on a normal desktop computer With an Intel i7 and a 1080 and whatever.

157
00:10:05,548 --> 00:10:17,192
Scott: so What the big news is is that Nvidia put out some new drivers for their new crazy Titan ridiculous video card But also for pretty much all Pascal video cards, which are

158
00:10:17,373 --> 00:10:18,456
Rym: all so the 1050 the 10 series

159
00:10:19,561 --> 00:10:25,824
Scott: Yeah, the 10 series and up right all the new ones the ones that you would buy today Not the old ones that you know There's no reason to buy.

160
00:10:25,844 --> 00:10:35,037
Rym: it also supports all the older geforce and quadra going all the way back to the 8000 series Sure, but anyway, the point is they released Mac drivers for these things.

161
00:10:35,137 --> 00:10:50,843
Scott: It's like wait a minute Wait, you released Mac drivers OS X drivers for a video card that the only way anyone could possibly put one of these video cards into a Mac is either a You've got the old trash can Mac Pro and you find a way to make it fit in there Which

162
00:10:50,864 --> 00:10:51,612
Rym: I'm dubious.

163
00:10:51,653 --> 00:10:53,498
Scott: if that's possible I don't think you can do that too.

164
00:10:54,186 --> 00:11:04,868
Scott: You can get one of these like External things were like you take a video card and you plug it into your macbook pro with like a you know Thunderbolt cable kind of deal or USB C cable.

165
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,974
Rym: Why is that a thing?

166
00:11:06,994 --> 00:11:08,257
Scott: I think it's possible.

167
00:11:08,317 --> 00:11:10,183
Scott: But yeah, whatever Yeah possible.

168
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:12,191
Rym: I mean a lot of things are possible with computing.

169
00:11:12,251 --> 00:11:14,480
Rym: run J2 the world is possible.

170
00:11:14,581 --> 00:11:16,860
Scott: See you make yourself a hackintosh.

171
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:23,900
Scott: So now there's an the one part of hackintoshing that was before You know or one of the parts that was slightly hacky is now significantly less hack.

172
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:29,456
Scott: You have an official legit Nvidia driver that we presume and video is testing on hackintoshes.

173
00:11:29,476 --> 00:11:30,640
Scott: cuz what else the hell could they test?

174
00:11:31,242 --> 00:11:31,765
Rym: So that's it.

175
00:11:32,167 --> 00:11:33,273
Rym: The real story here.

176
00:11:33,434 --> 00:11:34,460
Rym: Isn't that it happened?

177
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:37,050
Rym: It's why did Nvidia do it?

178
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:37,793
Rym: for the fuck of it?

179
00:11:37,813 --> 00:11:39,340
Rym: did Nvidia do it because of some agreement?

180
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:49,805
Scott: Oh because they're gonna make some Monet because there's people who are Mac people who are insisting on being Mac people are not buying Nvidia cards and now it's like hey all you people who insist on Not windowsing.

181
00:11:50,328 --> 00:11:52,079
Scott: Maybe we'll sell some Nvidia cards to you.

182
00:11:53,907 --> 00:11:56,980
Scott: It was worth it for us to make this driver to get those extra sales.

183
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:04,720
Rym: I don't know if that alone is enough business driver because I've seen Companies leave way more money on the table because it's not worth the effort.

184
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:12,105
Scott: well, also, I'm pretty sure the Apple computers like have ATI cards in them, right I Don't even know anymore.

185
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:20,379
Scott: I think I don't think this Nvidia's in the max right now From what I've definitely been in there in the past, but I don't think they are now.

186
00:12:22,061 --> 00:12:23,467
Rym: Everything is talking about hackintoshes.

187
00:12:23,487 --> 00:12:26,720
Scott: when I google for that obviously right just go to app.

188
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,950
Scott: Yeah, oh that I think has and I think that is Nvidia.

189
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:30,311
Rym: That's from 2012.

190
00:12:30,311 --> 00:12:30,552
Scott: Yeah.

191
00:12:30,572 --> 00:12:34,165
Rym: Oh My god this website.

192
00:12:34,205 --> 00:12:35,010
Rym: I don't even care anymore.

193
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:45,900
Rym: I've already given up but I Wonder if this is part of a longer-term thing where the next max are just going to have modern video cards.

194
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:52,901
Rym: Or maybe actually if Apple were smart and they didn't want to go your route of put you in charge of everything the smart Route.

195
00:12:53,102 --> 00:12:57,398
Rym: Yeah, but there's that there's a middle path where you make them at the new whatever the new Mac.

196
00:12:57,419 --> 00:13:00,849
Scott: Yeah, no Completely still like trash can.

197
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:13,603
Rym: Mac Pro has AMD cards in it But you make it still the like closed black box except you have a slot where you can put in a commodity video card The.

198
00:13:14,004 --> 00:13:19,520
Rym: so someone who buys the new Mac could keep replacing the video card and upgrading it.

199
00:13:19,761 --> 00:13:29,473
Rym: but they can't replace anything else without going through the Apple process and that would require probably a Relatively simple deal between Nvidia and Apple.

200
00:13:29,493 --> 00:13:30,939
Rym: I could see that happening though.

201
00:13:31,882 --> 00:13:35,492
Rym: Imagine the new trash can that has a video card slot you slot the video card.

202
00:13:35,532 --> 00:13:41,063
Scott: the MacBook Pros have Intel iris graphics 450.

203
00:13:41,063 --> 00:13:49,220
Rym: Yeah, probably if you want a powerful laptop at this point you just get a surface book Pro with the performance base for service book, whatever.

204
00:13:49,582 --> 00:13:50,851
Rym: There's the surface and the surface book.

205
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,260
Rym: get the one that has the performance base.

206
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,518
Scott: No, if you want a powerful laptop you get the gaming one.

207
00:13:55,578 --> 00:13:57,566
Scott: Oh, yeah You think it actually has a real GP.

208
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:58,770
Scott: got ones with 1080s in them.

209
00:13:58,931 --> 00:14:00,838
Rym: that weighs almost as much as my desktop.

210
00:14:00,938 --> 00:14:01,360
Scott: It runs.

211
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:02,922
Scott: It runs.

212
00:14:03,344 --> 00:14:06,914
Rym: not really a laptop so much as a portable computer that has a screen.

213
00:14:06,954 --> 00:14:11,767
Scott: It's still smaller than Like a mini ITX desktop.

214
00:14:12,148 --> 00:14:12,670
Rym: That is true.

215
00:14:13,051 --> 00:14:15,620
Scott: That is in fact true and doesn't require carrying a monitor.

216
00:14:16,082 --> 00:14:25,920
Rym: So in other news, this is this is a good use of technology and I'm really surprised This wasn't more widely deployed sooner and it may have been but I never really noticed it.

217
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:36,140
Rym: But so cops in Colorado are trying out this technology where the front of the cop car Can shoot a big old dart covered in glue like James Bond.

218
00:14:36,421 --> 00:14:41,400
Rym: Yeah, that sticks to the car in front of them and it's just a GPS beacon.

219
00:14:41,701 --> 00:14:47,877
Scott: Yeah, but I mean if you're sitting in your car and you're driving and you're trying to get away from the cops and you hear Thunk, you know, you'll be like, huh?

220
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:52,179
Scott: So then the cops stop following you and you go, huh and you get out of your car.

221
00:14:52,503 --> 00:14:53,940
Rym: You've got to stop to get out.

222
00:14:54,181 --> 00:14:57,994
Rym: They don't necessarily have to stop following you but it's not a high-speed pursuit.

223
00:14:58,275 --> 00:15:04,940
Rym: The only way to deal with this thing Pretty quickly, especially if the cops are chasing you your buddy, you know does a little action scene, right?

224
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,046
Scott: He's hanging out the window.

225
00:15:06,066 --> 00:15:07,695
Rym: Well, it's on the back of the car.

226
00:15:07,715 --> 00:15:08,600
Rym: I don't think that's gonna happen.

227
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:14,800
Rym: Yeah, you get on the trunk, you know crowbar I feel like your best option is to because remember that you got to abandon the car.

228
00:15:14,961 --> 00:15:18,580
Rym: Anyway, it's just gonna force you to abandon it sooner and turn it into a foot chase.

229
00:15:19,204 --> 00:15:26,439
Rym: but cops are actually using this stuff now and technology's actually made it pretty sweet and pretty safe and pretty affordable.

230
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:33,549
Rym: and supposedly they've been using these things for nine months now and They've had 85% success rate.

231
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:35,174
Scott: success rate is measured.

232
00:15:35,194 --> 00:15:37,000
Scott: how when when do they use them?

233
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:37,983
Scott: When do they not use them?

234
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:43,100
Rym: in situations where they would have had a high-speed pursuit because the suspect attempted to escape?

235
00:15:44,142 --> 00:16:03,060
Rym: so instead they just shoot the dart and then Helicopters and other cops can just sort of corral them or figure out where they dump the car and then as the foot chase Makes it a lot harder to get away because the whole goal of a high-speed pursuit is To still have the car and be out of line of sight of the cops long enough to get away.

236
00:16:03,961 --> 00:16:15,559
Rym: This makes that real hard to do because you can't even if you stop to try to take the thing off the car Like the cops know literally exactly where you are and that you've stopped gonna put an EMP in your car.

237
00:16:16,823 --> 00:16:18,810
Rym: The EMP would also take out the car.

238
00:16:19,472 --> 00:16:20,054
Scott: get old car.

239
00:16:20,596 --> 00:16:21,560
Rym: Oh, yeah, you know car.

240
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:26,736
Rym: I feel like the James Bond already have has ways to deal with this.

241
00:16:27,057 --> 00:16:29,859
Rym: This is more for James meth addict.

242
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:33,684
Rym: I Couldn't come up with another name.

243
00:16:33,724 --> 00:16:36,535
Scott: So just yeah, that's pretty much 90% of the time who's running.

244
00:16:36,555 --> 00:16:37,760
Rym: but this is in my idea.

245
00:16:37,981 --> 00:16:41,496
Rym: this is a good and interesting use of technology because there's a problem.

246
00:16:41,556 --> 00:16:45,268
Rym: the problem is Someone doesn't want to get arrested.

247
00:16:45,309 --> 00:16:52,591
Rym: when the police decide they're going to arrest them and there's and the cops have a choice Let the criminal go or chase them with their car.

248
00:16:52,651 --> 00:16:55,139
Rym: And as we know when you have cars chasing each other.

249
00:16:55,942 --> 00:17:02,760
Rym: Blues Brothers is gonna happen at some point and actually a lot of people get killed in high-speed pursuits Usually people unrelated to the high-speed pursuit.

250
00:17:04,121 --> 00:17:09,036
Rym: So even the ACLU weighed in saying that as long as they use them as they're intended.

251
00:17:09,578 --> 00:17:10,160
Rym: This is great.

252
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,061
Rym: It's not illegal.

253
00:17:12,402 --> 00:17:16,228
Rym: They're pretty much fine with it because this is only used when someone is.

254
00:17:16,248 --> 00:17:23,640
Scott: this isn't the kind I mean, you know Long law enforcement in general has misused GPS like they sneak up to your car at night and stick it inside.

255
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,640
Scott: This is a thing that's like funk.

256
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:30,340
Scott: It's on the back of your car and they're only using it when the cop is behind you and chasing you.

257
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,199
Scott: Yeah, it's not like, you know, there this is.

258
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:38,255
Rym: You can hide it in your car at night to see what you're doing all they do, but this isn't that.

259
00:17:38,275 --> 00:17:40,907
Rym: yeah This uses.

260
00:17:40,947 --> 00:17:41,934
Scott: this is an okay use.

261
00:17:43,281 --> 00:17:49,159
Scott: It's also very obvious like, you know, like even if you're even if you're just speeding and they you know They drive behind you and use it.

262
00:17:49,441 --> 00:17:54,755
Rym: I love the idea of you know, if we're gonna have cars that humans still drive.

263
00:17:54,775 --> 00:18:04,960
Rym: I am really okay with 100% enforcement of reasonable traffic laws like everyone who ever runs a stop sign immediate ticket immediate never drive again ever.

264
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:06,867
Scott: I think any driving.

265
00:18:06,887 --> 00:18:12,610
Scott: if we have cars that are have computers driving them Right and they drive effectively perfectly.

266
00:18:13,273 --> 00:18:17,612
Scott: if you don't drive as perfectly as they do You shouldn't be allowed to drive because you're effectively murdering.

267
00:18:17,672 --> 00:18:25,700
Rym: the practical reality of shitty Is that you need a car to live unless you live in like one of four places in the entire country, right?

268
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,072
Scott: So we'll give you a self-driving car.

269
00:18:27,253 --> 00:18:27,838
Rym: Okay, okay.

270
00:18:28,544 --> 00:18:34,782
Scott: Okay The problem you don't even have to give you one self-driving cars just driving around everywhere on their own and you just have one get in.

271
00:18:35,223 --> 00:18:45,720
Rym: but the leap the leap of society between we have the technology and We give that technology to all Americans to make society better.

272
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,660
Rym: I feel like the Gulf between those two is politically insurmountable.

273
00:18:49,821 --> 00:18:50,906
Scott: I'm also okay with the all.

274
00:18:50,926 --> 00:19:05,738
Scott: there's another with another plan right the same opposite plan Which is in places where people have used sidewalks we ban all cars No, and in places where people don't use sidewalks, you know, like the rest of the country We don't have any traffic rules.

275
00:19:06,723 --> 00:19:12,196
Scott: Everyone who drives X everyone who drives will just eventually die and will buy buy natural selection will get rid.

276
00:19:12,216 --> 00:19:14,987
Scott: of all people who want to drive Everything will be great.

277
00:19:15,229 --> 00:19:25,233
Rym: So I have driven cars in and around Istanbul and I've also ridden on motorbikes in Hyderabad in Mumbai.

278
00:19:25,734 --> 00:19:27,620
Scott: That's like almost the worst in the world.

279
00:19:29,161 --> 00:19:30,024
Rym: Also Sao Paulo.

280
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:32,451
Scott: I've heard a Kyra heard Cairo is possibly the worst.

281
00:19:32,491 --> 00:19:35,440
Rym: Sao Paulo and Brazil like in the downtown.

282
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:38,149
Rym: It's like New York in the freeways outside of New York.

283
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,352
Scott: Holy shit.

284
00:19:39,593 --> 00:19:41,620
Rym: Four lanes is actually twelve lanes.

285
00:19:50,473 --> 00:19:53,129
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

286
00:19:53,972 --> 00:19:58,429
Rym: Emily and I the other night stumbled upon this literally just randomly looking at YouTube shit.

287
00:19:59,751 --> 00:20:03,884
Rym: There is a movie slash documentary from 1988 called computer dreams.

288
00:20:06,212 --> 00:20:16,218
Rym: Okay, what it is is a showcase of the heights of computer animation in 1988.

289
00:20:16,218 --> 00:20:20,534
Scott: so slightly better than Tron, uh Not really.

290
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:20,594
Scott: no.

291
00:20:21,516 --> 00:20:26,409
Rym: so a lot of the things that we think of as computer animation were mostly practical effects back then.

292
00:20:27,473 --> 00:20:38,270
Rym: This looks like like the the best things in this documentary Look worse than the worst student project you have ever seen in your life from any year since.

293
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,178
Scott: But you said it was 1988 though, right?

294
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,969
Scott: Yeah, okay, but what year did Tron come out?

295
00:20:42,969 --> 00:20:46,438
Scott: 1983 two three something like that.

296
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,986
Scott: I think Tron is definitely before 1982, right?

297
00:20:49,006 --> 00:20:49,266
Rym: I was right.

298
00:20:50,651 --> 00:20:53,382
Scott: Yeah, so this is six years after Tron.

299
00:20:53,422 --> 00:20:55,290
Scott: shouldn't everything look at least as good as Tron?

300
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:58,762
Scott: So how good should look should look six years better than on.

301
00:20:58,902 --> 00:21:00,307
Rym: how good to try to actually look into.

302
00:21:00,367 --> 00:21:04,329
Rym: which parts of Toronto Are you thinking about that are actually computer generated fully?

303
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,499
Rym: Versus which ones actually use a lot of the light cycles.

304
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,306
Scott: The light cycles are computer generated.

305
00:21:09,386 --> 00:21:10,470
Rym: They don't look that good.

306
00:21:11,214 --> 00:21:11,878
Scott: Tron looks good.

307
00:21:11,898 --> 00:21:13,889
Scott: Yeah, we're looking at GL Tron there.

308
00:21:15,032 --> 00:21:16,648
Rym: That's the photo on IMDb.

309
00:21:17,332 --> 00:21:19,140
Scott: That might be GL Tron and not actual Tron.

310
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,390
Rym: the point is the best part about the documentary.

311
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:22,473
Scott: There's this documentary.

312
00:21:22,513 --> 00:21:23,516
Scott: that is your thing of the day.

313
00:21:23,576 --> 00:21:25,922
Scott: look better than those screenshots of Tron.

314
00:21:26,323 --> 00:21:27,787
Scott: So it's six years better.

315
00:21:27,807 --> 00:21:33,230
Rym: Uh So it's kind of all over the place because it's a highlight from a lot of different studios.

316
00:21:33,311 --> 00:21:35,531
Scott: I think it's not the height of 88.

317
00:21:35,531 --> 00:21:38,522
Scott: So there's probably some demo scene stuff from 88 that looks better.

318
00:21:38,763 --> 00:21:40,650
Rym: Well demo scene is very different from this stuff.

319
00:21:40,851 --> 00:21:42,890
Scott: Well, you said the height demo scene is the height.

320
00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:46,127
Rym: well so demo scene is a little bit different because that is not so much.

321
00:21:46,147 --> 00:21:50,930
Rym: that is computer graphics as opposed to like models and computer like rendering.

322
00:21:52,132 --> 00:21:52,818
Scott: It's one of those.

323
00:21:52,858 --> 00:21:54,330
Scott: or what it looks like isn't great.

324
00:21:54,511 --> 00:21:59,870
Rym: A lot of demo scene stuff is raster graphics or very specialized draw the pixels.

325
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:03,572
Rym: I'm just saying as opposed to here is a model of a thing You're not.

326
00:22:03,612 --> 00:22:05,219
Scott: you're not talking about how like how good it looks.

327
00:22:05,239 --> 00:22:11,750
Scott: you think about like the the height is in terms of like the Functionality behind it like whoa, this looks like crap, but it's actually a physics engine from 1988.

328
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,658
Rym: So the technology the output the uses of it.

329
00:22:14,678 --> 00:22:19,110
Rym: the craziest part is this one bit showed the idea of modeling.

330
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:21,550
Rym: How do you make a computer model of a person to then like animate?

331
00:22:22,312 --> 00:22:39,723
Rym: So they literally sculpted a person and then drew on that physical model basically a mesh of polygons and then used a light pen to trace over the Physical model to input the data into the computer to make the model.

332
00:22:39,904 --> 00:22:40,105
Scott: Mm-hmm.

333
00:22:40,867 --> 00:22:41,690
Scott: I remember when they did that.

334
00:22:41,911 --> 00:22:42,715
Rym: Yeah, you remember that.

335
00:22:42,755 --> 00:22:44,785
Rym: you remember it to them doing that in 1989.

336
00:22:44,785 --> 00:22:48,950
Scott: I remember those days I've seen that I've seen I've seen that technology in use before.

337
00:22:49,813 --> 00:22:55,714
Rym: This video also gives some pretty heavy vaporwave vibes if you watch it, so Good luck.

338
00:22:55,734 --> 00:22:56,095
Rym: Have fun.

339
00:22:56,135 --> 00:22:56,456
Rym: Watch it.

340
00:22:56,516 --> 00:22:56,978
Rym: Enjoy it.

341
00:22:57,199 --> 00:22:58,041
Rym: And it's pretty.

342
00:22:58,824 --> 00:23:00,449
Rym: it's pretty interesting to see this.

343
00:23:01,274 --> 00:23:15,050
Scott: So in more crime news, there are some people in prison I don't know what for they were at the what the hell the Ohio department Rehabilitation and Corrections Center somewhere in Ohio Marion Correctional Institution Anyway in Marion, Ohio.

344
00:23:15,672 --> 00:23:20,907
Scott: So they were in prison and part of their prisonness was they got computer classes in prison.

345
00:23:20,927 --> 00:23:28,410
Scott: and I was like when I read that I was like, hey, maybe I should like go to prison like no just like just like Rikers Island wanted me to teach people.

346
00:23:28,832 --> 00:23:32,227
Scott: You know, I guess they're gonna close it right but you know, I'll go teach people in prison.

347
00:23:32,247 --> 00:23:32,810
Scott: How do you computer?

348
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:33,833
Scott: I'll teach him real good.

349
00:23:34,175 --> 00:23:36,062
Rym: I suspect they will not pay you enough money.

350
00:23:36,424 --> 00:23:37,408
Scott: It's a volunteer job.

351
00:23:37,468 --> 00:23:37,910
Scott: I assume.

352
00:23:38,911 --> 00:23:51,699
Scott: but anyway, all right, but they got computer classes in prison totally cool and Apparently these the the supervision at this prison was good enough to keep anyone from escaping Because I guess no one escaped as far as I could tell.

353
00:23:52,241 --> 00:23:56,841
Scott: but they didn't really give a shit what people did in the prison Which seems to be how prison goes.

354
00:23:56,861 --> 00:24:05,870
Scott: Yes, so They took these computer parts and basically took working computers back into some sort of you know place.

355
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:06,976
Scott: So they're not supposed to have them.

356
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:12,329
Scott: and not only did they have working computers They plugged them in to the network.

357
00:24:13,473 --> 00:24:20,910
Scott: They put the computers in the ceiling and connected them to the network Yep, and logged in using an employee's login when that employee was not at work.

358
00:24:21,756 --> 00:24:23,609
Scott: This wasn't just the prison network.

359
00:24:24,011 --> 00:24:29,310
Scott: It was like the state's computer network because it was a state prison and it's all the state places are on the same network.

360
00:24:30,112 --> 00:24:34,322
Scott: So I'm assuming they only found out because the state IT guys noticed.

361
00:24:34,743 --> 00:24:34,904
Scott: Huh?

362
00:24:34,924 --> 00:24:37,049
Scott: There's a lot of activity coming from like these two.

363
00:24:38,752 --> 00:24:40,116
Scott: Where the hell are these computers?

364
00:24:40,297 --> 00:24:41,521
Scott: Oh shit, they're in this prison.

365
00:24:42,103 --> 00:24:43,107
Scott: Who's the hell's doing it?

366
00:24:43,307 --> 00:24:44,050
Scott: Oh, it's this guy.

367
00:24:44,431 --> 00:24:46,419
Scott: He's doing it when he's not even on the job.

368
00:24:46,479 --> 00:24:49,370
Scott: When is he easy logging in on like Sunday morning to internet?

369
00:24:49,671 --> 00:24:50,754
Scott: What the hell right.

370
00:24:51,136 --> 00:24:55,010
Scott: and then they found out and it's like whoa, but if we are ever in prison obvious.

371
00:24:55,492 --> 00:24:57,441
Scott: So so way to go prisoners good job.

372
00:24:57,481 --> 00:24:58,345
Scott: This was on FARC.

373
00:24:58,767 --> 00:25:01,174
Scott: So I don't Prison.

374
00:25:01,194 --> 00:25:02,644
Scott: bad job unless it was just drugs.

375
00:25:02,684 --> 00:25:03,489
Scott: in which case good job.

376
00:25:03,952 --> 00:25:05,358
Rym: So, uh, what did you read?

377
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:06,684
Rym: what they use the computers to do?

378
00:25:06,704 --> 00:25:07,568
Scott: look at porn.

379
00:25:07,608 --> 00:25:07,970
Scott: I assume.

380
00:25:08,199 --> 00:25:19,701
Rym: Oh, yeah You assume that to quote the Ohio Inspector General says visitors found inmate use the computer to steal the identity of another inmate Submit credit card applications on his behalf and commit tax fraud.

381
00:25:19,741 --> 00:25:21,085
Scott: Well, they just.

382
00:25:21,106 --> 00:25:21,768
Scott: you're in prison.

383
00:25:21,788 --> 00:25:22,510
Scott: What good is money?

384
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:23,536
Scott: What good is a credit card?

385
00:25:23,556 --> 00:25:24,020
Scott: You're in prison.

386
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,350
Scott: Amazon ain't gonna deliver shit one.

387
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:30,470
Rym: I assume you're gonna get out of prison at some point at least you think you will - you pry no people on the outside.

388
00:25:30,894 --> 00:25:32,790
Scott: You're having your people on the outside buy good shit.

389
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:35,067
Scott: So when you get out you be like, ah, here's all the good shit about it.

390
00:25:35,611 --> 00:25:38,869
Rym: Maybe or maybe you're sending money to people and then they're getting your.

391
00:25:38,929 --> 00:25:42,270
Rym: you know They're sneaking the contraband in because our prisons let people do whatever they want.

392
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,667
Scott: I see computers in so why not right?

393
00:25:44,727 --> 00:25:46,394
Scott: Yeah That's pretty good.

394
00:25:46,454 --> 00:25:47,841
Scott: I also read that.

395
00:25:47,981 --> 00:25:55,610
Scott: I don't know if they had a. I don't know if they had a printer But apparently they made like security passes and use that get through security checkpoints.

396
00:25:56,192 --> 00:25:59,826
Rym: So I've known a few people have worked at prison over the years and so have you and I did that.

397
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:03,838
Rym: the one thing I've Learned from talking to anyone who's ever interacted with their prison system.

398
00:26:04,339 --> 00:26:05,402
Rym: Is that it's garbage.

399
00:26:05,503 --> 00:26:14,570
Rym: people in prison are bored and They will eventually figure out how to get around things because they're bored.

400
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:19,550
Scott: That's right back in the day prisoners used to like, you know study in the library and pass the bar, right?

401
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:29,470
Scott: I'm sure some of them still do that because they know their public defender can't help them because they got 7,000 cases So they end up doing it themselves, you know, cuz they're not guilty or whatever, right?

402
00:26:29,731 --> 00:26:36,822
Scott: So that you know, that's just one of the things you can do with your prison time man If I was in prison, I would you know, it was some skill.

403
00:26:36,842 --> 00:26:39,390
Scott: I would practice that I'd be become the god of something.

404
00:26:39,851 --> 00:26:44,426
Scott: Nope, no matter at least way and at least one thing possibly more than one thing.

405
00:26:44,467 --> 00:26:45,530
Rym: You're real good at shivs.

406
00:26:46,445 --> 00:26:49,956
Scott: Oh, man Where's that?

407
00:26:49,996 --> 00:26:50,218
Rym: cop?

408
00:26:50,238 --> 00:26:54,116
Rym: prison comics momo Shav is like ain't done yet.

409
00:26:54,136 --> 00:26:54,537
Rym: Yeah.

410
00:26:54,897 --> 00:26:56,020
Scott: No, man, you go to the MoMA.

411
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,505
Scott: They'd be like Scott's shivs like masterpieces.

412
00:26:58,525 --> 00:27:02,661
Rym: I Saw an exhibit in a museum once.

413
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:07,720
Rym: that was a collection of Improvised weapons from US prison.

414
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:10,150
Scott: Oh, that was the thing of the day a long long time ago.

415
00:27:10,331 --> 00:27:12,290
Rym: No when I was a kid, I saw it in a museum in Detroit.

416
00:27:13,175 --> 00:27:18,494
Scott: Are you sure it wasn't the thing of the day that we're from a long time ago It was it's been the thing of the day I think multiple times.

417
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:24,491
Scott: that is often a thing on the internet is an extremely early thing of the day like 2005 or 6.

418
00:27:24,491 --> 00:27:28,084
Rym: Anyway, oh look a ton of improvised prison weapons.

419
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:30,414
Rym: Oh Look at this gun.

420
00:27:31,237 --> 00:27:31,960
Scott: It's a gun.

421
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,706
Rym: That's a pretty good zip gun there.

422
00:27:33,887 --> 00:27:34,630
Scott: Congratulations.

423
00:27:35,671 --> 00:27:37,965
Rym: That looks like a four-barreled shotgun.

424
00:27:38,005 --> 00:27:39,650
Scott: someone made Good job.

425
00:27:42,231 --> 00:27:43,253
Rym: Here's some pretty good shivs.

426
00:27:43,655 --> 00:27:47,445
Rym: Well, this guy's got like a cross guard for his fans like a dueling spoon.

427
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:47,545
Rym: Yeah.

428
00:27:48,006 --> 00:27:55,827
Rym: Yeah In the middle of the book the book is still Frank Gerberts dune Dune a not do.

429
00:27:56,652 --> 00:27:57,333
Rym: Yeah, we'll read it.

430
00:27:57,353 --> 00:27:58,737
Scott: It's on Carmack's doom.

431
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:00,261
Rym: We'll read it at some point.

432
00:28:00,682 --> 00:28:02,607
Rym: It's doing some point.

433
00:28:02,988 --> 00:28:07,856
Rym: after I Began in I'm hanging out with the bird people now.

434
00:28:07,876 --> 00:28:08,920
Rym: I think I'm gonna do that great be.

435
00:28:08,961 --> 00:28:13,736
Rym: second and I got the master sword Finally, yeah, I just I never.

436
00:28:13,796 --> 00:28:19,613
Rym: I only have two stamina wheels and I just went around beating shrines until I got enough heart containers I beat.

437
00:28:19,753 --> 00:28:21,057
Scott: I got I will.

438
00:28:21,237 --> 00:28:25,510
Scott: I've never treated with the dark guy in a clean house before I you know, whatever.

439
00:28:25,811 --> 00:28:27,359
Rym: Yeah, I've never treated with the dark God.

440
00:28:27,379 --> 00:28:29,610
Scott: I haven't played in a while gonna play probably me today.

441
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,949
Rym: I was playing last night during that awful hockey game.

442
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,715
Scott: anyway What other metamoments we got?

443
00:28:35,996 --> 00:28:37,301
Rym: our YouTube channels are pretty good.

444
00:28:37,321 --> 00:28:37,983
Rym: You should follow them.

445
00:28:38,224 --> 00:28:40,230
Scott: We're making more video contents lately.

446
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:41,052
Scott: You should watch.

447
00:28:41,293 --> 00:28:42,356
Scott: you follow us on.

448
00:28:42,537 --> 00:28:44,462
Scott: you know, any social media that you got?

449
00:28:45,044 --> 00:28:47,010
Scott: Twitter Facebook's Instagram.

450
00:28:47,312 --> 00:28:48,980
Scott: Yeah, we have all those things.

451
00:28:49,402 --> 00:28:50,990
Scott: We are on all the places of the Internet.

452
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:59,128
Rym: so I'm actually trying to post to Instagram more because I made an account and I never really used it and I Noticed that a ton of you are following it even though I never really post anything.

453
00:28:59,148 --> 00:28:59,550
Rym: So I'm gonna start.

454
00:29:00,518 --> 00:29:03,698
Scott: I think I have a GeekNights' Instagram I made I don't know where with the.

455
00:29:03,778 --> 00:29:14,429
Scott: I gotta log into it again, but I met when I made it I was like, aha every time we do a thing like go to a convention or whatever I could post like a photo and then I kept meaning to do it and then not doing it.

456
00:29:14,892 --> 00:29:17,848
Scott: But maybe now that I've said something maybe we'll do it.

457
00:29:19,714 --> 00:29:21,929
Scott: We can post photos of GeekNights things there.

458
00:29:22,911 --> 00:29:28,270
Rym: So, uh, otherwise, yeah, let's just get right into it with computer cooling because we've never really talked about this in depth.

459
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:33,590
Rym: We've always talked about like the side issues around it or we talked about servers.

460
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:41,970
Scott: This is one of those topics right where we feel like we did a show on it because we it comes up all the time And we talk about it all the time, but it never got its own show.

461
00:29:42,492 --> 00:29:45,503
Scott: We did do a show on server room cooling which has nothing to do with this.

462
00:29:45,704 --> 00:29:47,311
Rym: Yep, and we did that show in like 2013.

463
00:29:47,311 --> 00:29:49,170
Rym: I want to say it was a long time ago.

464
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:52,250
Scott: So I'm gonna start way low cuz that's how we got to do in GeekNights.

465
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:57,110
Rym: Yeah Like the old how computers work series I did back in 2006 you got yourself a computer.

466
00:29:57,692 --> 00:29:58,915
Scott: And how does the computer work?

467
00:29:59,035 --> 00:30:03,186
Scott: is basically this chip which is basically a bunch of wires really tiny.

468
00:30:03,206 --> 00:30:04,610
Rym: No, you're going that low.

469
00:30:04,951 --> 00:30:09,790
Scott: Yeah, it's a basically a flat piece of silicon with electricity running through it like crazy.

470
00:30:09,951 --> 00:30:17,878
Scott: Right now if you take a wire and just put it on a double-a battery, which is not a lot of electricity That wire gets so hot it burns you.

471
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:18,861
Rym: Well, it depends.

472
00:30:19,223 --> 00:30:21,250
Rym: I mean the battery will get hotter than the wire.

473
00:30:21,511 --> 00:30:23,743
Scott: I'm just saying it gets hot.

474
00:30:23,763 --> 00:30:25,110
Scott: That's how electrons work, right?

475
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,034
Scott: They make metal hot.

476
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:26,516
Scott: what show?

477
00:30:26,537 --> 00:30:28,124
Rym: the electron turns through stuff.

478
00:30:28,405 --> 00:30:29,490
Rym: they get hot, right?

479
00:30:29,851 --> 00:30:41,883
Scott: So when you have a big old power supply on your computer and you're shoving all those watts through this basically extremely thin flat piece of silicon Semiconductor it gets crazy hot right?

480
00:30:42,024 --> 00:30:43,069
Scott: That's just how it does now.

481
00:30:44,292 --> 00:30:47,970
Rym: Why not let it get hot now in the old days with like old crappy computers?

482
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:55,690
Scott: Sure, a lot of old computers would just be super hot Yeah, and it's like as long as it doesn't get so hot that it breaks.

483
00:30:56,773 --> 00:30:57,438
Scott: Why not right?

484
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,910
Scott: I mean it makes your room warm.

485
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:02,813
Scott: But it's not really an issue unless it like melts the chip and it stops working Right.

486
00:31:02,874 --> 00:31:10,870
Scott: as long as the computer keeps working It's fine any and computer chips can operate at pretty high temperatures actually like hot enough to burn you.

487
00:31:10,931 --> 00:31:11,848
Scott: But the computer is just fine.

488
00:31:12,211 --> 00:31:24,557
Rym: But in the old days like 486 like these early days of computing They're like the wires inside of all this stuff were actually pretty big and the things weren't doing that much work And they weren't using that much power.

489
00:31:24,678 --> 00:31:30,080
Rym: Like I don't think you realize how slow a 286 is yeah compared to modern computing.

490
00:31:30,481 --> 00:31:36,097
Scott: It's like my modern computer is like a thousands of Maybe even hundreds.

491
00:31:36,198 --> 00:31:42,490
Scott: I made tens of I don't even know how many a lot Yeah, at least thousands anyway, so in the old days you pretty much just like a computer just worked.

492
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,775
Rym: You didn't really think about cooling.

493
00:31:43,996 --> 00:31:48,938
Rym: you definitely never had to do anything about cooling Yeah, you didn't even build your own.

494
00:31:49,058 --> 00:32:01,390
Scott: often often the computer would have you know, even Things that aren't actual like full PCs But just electronics will have heat sinks for any parts that heat up right and a heat sink is a really basic device.

495
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:04,019
Scott: It's a piece of metal shaped in an interesting way.

496
00:32:04,139 --> 00:32:08,637
Scott: So basically all you're trying to do with a heat sink is increased surface area.

497
00:32:08,878 --> 00:32:14,469
Scott: right you've got this chip that's flat and It gets hot and the heat comes out the top.

498
00:32:15,254 --> 00:32:27,204
Scott: So if you put a piece of metal on top that conducts heat Right that piece of metal will heat up and then that piece of metal has wings or you know fins on it of some Kind or spikes or some something to increase the surface area.

499
00:32:27,224 --> 00:32:33,310
Scott: It's all about surface area and That will just conduct the heat into the air more efficiently.

500
00:32:33,734 --> 00:32:35,230
Scott: So it cools down faster.

501
00:32:35,312 --> 00:32:43,470
Scott: You know like if you take a heat sink and you just put it on like your forehead like your forehead will feel cool because The heat coming out of your head is being conducted, right?

502
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:44,342
Scott: I don't know why.

503
00:32:44,425 --> 00:32:46,886
Scott: you know We make hats for people in the winter to stay warm.

504
00:32:46,906 --> 00:32:51,870
Scott: that insulate We can make heat sink has to cool down in the summer and I just I guess it's not stylish.

505
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:55,069
Scott: Well, the reason would also be really heavy wearing metal on your head.

506
00:32:55,270 --> 00:33:03,201
Rym: The main reason you need to increase all the surface area is because it turns out if you don't know this that air like the air You breathe it's actually a really good insulator.

507
00:33:03,361 --> 00:33:04,887
Rym: Yeah, the only reason the air.

508
00:33:05,811 --> 00:33:09,430
Scott: That's why winter coats are warm because they're all poofy and the air is insulating.

509
00:33:09,611 --> 00:33:13,530
Scott: The only reason the layers keep you warm cuz every layer has area between.

510
00:33:14,411 --> 00:33:18,384
Rym: Without a fan like with that heat sink is because the air actually moves around.

511
00:33:18,424 --> 00:33:22,461
Rym: because the convection says the air gets hot It'll start cycling around and moving out of the way.

512
00:33:22,521 --> 00:33:24,490
Rym: because there's a lot of reasons not getting into the physics.

513
00:33:24,611 --> 00:33:34,190
Rym: But because air is not a good Conductor of heat you need to have the biggest surface area possible to spread that heat out exposed to as much air as possible.

514
00:33:34,491 --> 00:33:39,393
Scott: So the heat sink was like the first step of cooling computers that they didn't break from all the heat They made right.

515
00:33:39,413 --> 00:33:42,490
Rym: and then the old days you pretty much just had a heat sink on your CPU, right?

516
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:49,330
Scott: So the second step was we had to introduce fans right because the air just from convection alone wasn't moving around enough.

517
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:50,458
Scott: now You're like, well, wait a minute.

518
00:33:51,023 --> 00:33:51,870
Scott: Why do I need a fan?

519
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:54,881
Scott: Can't I just like not put my computer in a box.

520
00:33:55,162 --> 00:33:57,010
Scott: right if we didn't put our computers in boxes?

521
00:33:57,231 --> 00:34:00,150
Scott: It's like yeah, you actually probably wouldn't need as much fans.

522
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:09,070
Scott: You could just make sure that like your room has good circulation or you've got an air conditioner on or something You know, but like you would need a lot less fan if you didn't put your computer in a box.

523
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:15,135
Rym: So air that's moved on its own by the heat action alone Doesn't move that much.

524
00:34:15,295 --> 00:34:18,666
Scott: No, but when you've got a lot more air in the room, right?

525
00:34:18,746 --> 00:34:19,830
Scott: It's not as much of a problem.

526
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:27,768
Scott: However, the thing is when you put your computer in a box, you know You're trapping that hot air in there to some extent even if you got holes and stuff, right?

527
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:41,610
Scott: So the reason we put the computer in a box, even though it causes a slight heat problem Is because you're gonna expose your expensive computer to someone stepping on it someone spilling something on it someone kicking it.

528
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:43,172
Rym: So forget all those practical concerns.

529
00:34:43,232 --> 00:34:44,594
Rym: only two real reasons.

530
00:34:45,135 --> 00:34:46,237
Scott: one boxes are cool.

531
00:34:46,498 --> 00:34:48,000
Rym: electronics attract us.

532
00:34:48,831 --> 00:34:53,449
Rym: So if electronics are exposed to the open air, they will be covered in dust.

533
00:34:53,469 --> 00:34:55,550
Rym: Why do you think you need to dust your TV all the time?

534
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:59,010
Scott: Yeah, so that's why even though it's bad for heat.

535
00:34:59,091 --> 00:35:08,721
Rym: We put the computer in a box But - if you just have all the components out in the air and you don't have some sort of active Directed movement of air over those heat sinks.

536
00:35:09,102 --> 00:35:10,750
Rym: You're not actually gonna get that much cool.

537
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:12,618
Scott: It'll still be better than in the box.

538
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,170
Scott: Well, it's an improvement over in the box is what I'm saying.

539
00:35:15,331 --> 00:35:20,109
Rym: Yeah, assuming you don't have any fans, but by putting it in the box you can direct air through.

540
00:35:20,532 --> 00:35:22,670
Scott: You can direct air through it even without the box, right?

541
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:29,210
Rym: Yeah with unless you direct the air pretty like if you don't have channels or some way to really direct the air You're not gonna get that much better.

542
00:35:29,812 --> 00:35:42,369
Rym: fans are pretty directed and the first of the big difference between old computers and new computers is that as Computers have gotten more complicated more parts of the computer generate a lot of heat that needs to be distributed.

543
00:35:42,409 --> 00:35:42,851
Scott: Yes That's.

544
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:47,870
Rym: that's why motherboards today have a whole bunch of passive heat sinks and heat pipes all the fuck over them.

545
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:55,770
Scott: Yeah, so computers got faster and they got hotter and we figured well, we can't really make them faster without making them hotter very easily.

546
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:58,924
Scott: Let's just make them faster and solve the heat problem separately, right?

547
00:35:58,984 --> 00:36:00,250
Scott: so fans.

548
00:36:01,151 --> 00:36:05,490
Scott: So there's a lot of argument going on the internet like about how you should do fans, right?

549
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,057
Scott: Like what kind of fans you should get?

550
00:36:07,137 --> 00:36:07,700
Scott: how many?

551
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,710
Scott: which direction do you aim them all this stuff?

552
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,203
Scott: So I'm gonna tell you what you should do.

553
00:36:11,244 --> 00:36:15,965
Scott: number one You got to make the heat sure the heat sink on the CPU the hottest thing.

554
00:36:16,447 --> 00:36:18,254
Scott: as a fan on it It's gonna come with one.

555
00:36:18,555 --> 00:36:21,265
Rym: So right again now this really comes down to you can?

556
00:36:21,285 --> 00:36:24,033
Rym: there are passive heat sinks for CPUs.

557
00:36:24,494 --> 00:36:32,283
Rym: the drawbacks of these are one it better not be a super high-performing Chip or it's gonna slow itself down because it's gonna get too hot adding.

558
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:35,535
Scott: having that you got the increased surface area Thanks to this awesome heat sink.

559
00:36:35,595 --> 00:36:37,481
Scott: If you start blowing the air onto it.

560
00:36:37,842 --> 00:36:40,090
Scott: That's just like whoa super cooling right there.

561
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:41,227
Scott: It's so good, right?

562
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:54,009
Scott: If you want to see this in action, look at passive heat sinks on modern computers or go Go on YouTube find videos of like CPU fans taken with like thermal like infrared camera type things and it's like Oh, I see how the fan works.

563
00:36:54,552 --> 00:37:09,470
Rym: Ooh, you can also see videos of like blowing smoke into computers to see how the smoke travels through all the fans but the passive heat sinks on modern CPUs are Enormous because they have to be enormous if there's no fan in it actively moving air through it.

564
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:15,790
Rym: Yep, because all the air moving through really does is expose it to more air of a lower average temperature, right?

565
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:16,974
Scott: You know think about this right?

566
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:20,506
Scott: Imagine you're in your room, right and it's summer.

567
00:37:20,887 --> 00:37:21,610
Scott: It's hot summer.

568
00:37:21,791 --> 00:37:25,129
Scott: It's so hot that I'm even sweating a little bit and I'm like mmm.

569
00:37:25,611 --> 00:37:27,338
Scott: Maybe I will turn on the air conditioner.

570
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:28,202
Scott: Maybe right?

571
00:37:28,222 --> 00:37:28,764
Scott: That's how hot.

572
00:37:28,804 --> 00:37:29,728
Scott: it is crazy hot.

573
00:37:29,848 --> 00:37:39,469
Scott: So Do you want a fan to be blowing on you or do you want a fan to be aimed blowing away from you?

574
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:47,190
Rym: All right, so that is actually a difficult question depending on a lot of very specific circumstances, but we're gonna skip all that.

575
00:37:48,012 --> 00:37:56,527
Rym: Yeah, so in general you just want air to be moving over or through Whatever the surface is that you're using to distribute that heat.

576
00:37:56,929 --> 00:37:57,069
Rym: Mm-hmm.

577
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:59,757
Scott: So, you know you got you're the CPU.

578
00:38:00,238 --> 00:38:02,684
Scott: your heatsink is your skins, right?

579
00:38:03,025 --> 00:38:04,630
Scott: You just got to have air moving across.

580
00:38:04,951 --> 00:38:11,490
Scott: Yep, right, you know if you'd aim your fan go out the window to try to get the hot air out of your room.

581
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:21,470
Scott: You know that means the cold the new fresh air is gonna be like sucked into your room through like all the not airtight parts of Your room right like underneath your front door and stuff.

582
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:29,455
Rym: Yep So you basically need a fan on the CPU directing air from the water area of your case Into and then out of that Heating.

583
00:38:29,536 --> 00:38:30,764
Scott: so it's the same thing with a computer.

584
00:38:30,844 --> 00:38:31,650
Scott: we think about the box.

585
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:39,510
Scott: Your computer is in your case as a room and the CPU is the person in the room Right in the outside is cold and the inside is hot.

586
00:38:40,152 --> 00:38:45,307
Scott: You got to have some fans definitely the top fan aiming up blowing the hot air out.

587
00:38:45,328 --> 00:38:47,788
Scott: cuz hot air rises Right, you got to get the hot air out of the box.

588
00:38:48,371 --> 00:39:01,850
Scott: You also got to bring the cool air that's in the room outside the box into the box you have the in intake fans and Outtake fans because when you get that cool air from your room blowing right on to the CPU the CPU goes.

589
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:03,948
Scott: Now a lot of the same way you go.

590
00:39:05,212 --> 00:39:12,380
Rym: Just have the power supply would have its own fan drawing air from inside the case And skicking out the back and we'll have matters.

591
00:39:12,762 --> 00:39:14,990
Rym: usually didn't have any other case fans?

592
00:39:15,592 --> 00:39:16,235
Scott: No, usually not.

593
00:39:16,576 --> 00:39:19,910
Rym: if they did they maybe had an intake fan in the front someone.

594
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:22,370
Scott: I don't think my apple 2gs has any fans whatsoever.

595
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:29,193
Rym: My 486 had one intake fan on the front and the PSU was the exhaust fan on the back and it was roughly a static Pressure case.

596
00:39:29,795 --> 00:39:32,186
Scott: I think the 486 only had PSU fans.

597
00:39:32,206 --> 00:39:33,230
Scott: I don't think had any other fan.

598
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:34,437
Rym: I definitely had an intake fan.

599
00:39:34,457 --> 00:39:38,236
Rym: cuz I would I would take it apart and dust the hell out of it Dog hair, right?

600
00:39:38,317 --> 00:39:40,224
Scott: So that's the other problem, right?

601
00:39:40,244 --> 00:39:41,970
Scott: We talked about dust before right?

602
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:45,749
Scott: But once you get these fans going on dust becomes a big issue.

603
00:39:45,829 --> 00:39:52,630
Rym: now It's less dust than if you just have it out in the open But you're still taking air from the room and pushing it into a closed box.

604
00:39:52,731 --> 00:39:55,509
Scott: So all the dust in your room gets sucked in by this fan.

605
00:39:55,992 --> 00:40:03,604
Scott: So on all your fans that suck air in you need to put filters Right to keep the dust out and then you had to clean those filters once in a while.

606
00:40:03,925 --> 00:40:08,987
Scott: and I can tell you I have filters On my computer on all my intake fans and my computer is so dust-free.

607
00:40:09,007 --> 00:40:10,768
Scott: when I open it It looks like it looks almost new.

608
00:40:11,171 --> 00:40:12,495
Rym: I have some old.

609
00:40:12,696 --> 00:40:21,390
Rym: most people did not put filters on their computer intakes unless they were nerds who made custom computers Only recently have a lot of like in the last five or six years of most cases.

610
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:24,110
Scott: Yeah, all modern cases will come with filters.

611
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:28,870
Rym: But I've noticed pre-built computers pretty much never do and a lot of pre-built computers still use negative pressure.

612
00:40:29,171 --> 00:40:35,570
Rym: So everything we're talking about what nerds will say is do you have a positive pressure case or a negative pressure case, right?

613
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:39,884
Scott: So positive pressure means that you got more air being sucked into the box.

614
00:40:40,305 --> 00:40:41,610
Scott: then you have pushing out.

615
00:40:41,851 --> 00:40:48,803
Scott: So your fans that spit air out are not pushing out as many Cubic feet per second of air as the fans that push air in.

616
00:40:49,164 --> 00:40:59,212
Scott: so now the air pressure inside The box is higher than the air pressure outside the box Which means dust can't like, you know get sucked in through like the crevices in the side of the case Cuz.

617
00:40:59,312 --> 00:41:02,150
Scott: air is getting, you know pushed out of those holes, right?

618
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:04,058
Scott: So nothing's gonna come in there now.

619
00:41:04,138 --> 00:41:12,490
Rym: in my experience people used to argue and I've I've argued on both sides of this based on experience over the years if they're in the absence of any filters.

620
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:18,370
Rym: A lot of people argue that positive pressure still reduces internal dust as opposed to negative pressure.

621
00:41:19,112 --> 00:41:26,530
Rym: Some people will argue the opposite and I have found over the course of my entire life that actually that is so highly situational.

622
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:28,970
Rym: That's very difficult to make a broad judgment, right?

623
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:30,757
Scott: Now really negative pressure would be.

624
00:41:30,797 --> 00:41:36,722
Scott: you got so many so many fans in your computer spitting air out That the air just gets sucked in from the outside.

625
00:41:36,782 --> 00:41:45,715
Scott: the pressure inside your computer is so low And now all this cool air is getting just like pulled into the computer on its own and you think oh both of those sound Kind of good, which one do I want?

626
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:50,570
Scott: and the answer is you want positive be only want a little bit positive, right?

627
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:54,377
Scott: You don't want to be like super positive Because that's that causes problems.

628
00:41:54,437 --> 00:42:01,502
Scott: all the fans that are trying to suck air in and out fighting against each other Right, like if you had two fans both trying to pull air out.

629
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:03,710
Scott: It's like they're pulling against each other, right?

630
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:07,730
Scott: There's like, you know, the air sort of connects them like a rope, you know physics.

631
00:42:08,312 --> 00:42:16,189
Scott: So, you know, you don't have too much positive or too much negative, but you want slightly positive so that you don't get dust You know pushing its way into the holes.

632
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:17,377
Rym: So let's talk practical.

633
00:42:17,497 --> 00:42:26,278
Rym: the reality is in the older days You really had to think a lot about how you're gonna route your air and how you gonna where you gonna put all your stupid ribbon Gables and all this nonsense, but now you

634
00:42:26,318 --> 00:42:29,312
Scott: buy a case that had like a whole bunch of fan holes and no fans Like.

635
00:42:29,332 --> 00:42:32,030
Scott: well, do I put fans on all these holes and which direction do I point them?

636
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:39,650
Rym: And nowadays pretty much buy a modern computer case from one of the modern companies that sells to nerds and everything is already set up.

637
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:43,702
Rym: Yep The fans will all be pointing in the right direction and just do what the case says.

638
00:42:43,802 --> 00:42:45,146
Scott: almost everything these days.

639
00:42:45,206 --> 00:42:46,974
Scott: a standard mid tower case At least right.

640
00:42:46,994 --> 00:42:51,276
Scott: if you buy not standard mid tower case, it's gonna be weird But a standard mid tower case right.

641
00:42:51,316 --> 00:43:00,552
Rym: your PSU is gonna have an intake and an outtake fan on its own and your PSU is Gonna be in the back bottom of the case, which is the opposite of how computers used to be used to be in the top Back.

642
00:43:00,693 --> 00:43:01,116
Scott: Yeah.

643
00:43:01,176 --> 00:43:02,747
Scott: Anyway, and it's gonna just deal with itself.

644
00:43:02,827 --> 00:43:07,186
Scott: No problem Right, the GPU is gonna have fans built into it that are appropriate to itself.

645
00:43:07,246 --> 00:43:08,070
Scott: Just let it do its thing.

646
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:10,580
Rym: We'll talk a little bit about the three kinds of GPU fans.

647
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:25,178
Scott: Yeah, your CPU will have a Cooler that comes with it and if it doesn't buy a very standard one There's no reason to get one of those ginormous stupid ones unless You're overclocking which you shouldn't do well

648
00:43:25,299 --> 00:43:32,284
Rym: or so the the high-end Normal i7 chip today the normal i7 the highest one does

649
00:43:32,304 --> 00:43:33,689
Scott: no longer comes with the heatsink.

650
00:43:33,789 --> 00:43:36,090
Rym: Yep So you have to buy an aftermarket heatsink.

651
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:40,050
Rym: That's correct and the chip will just perform better if you cool it more up to a certain point.

652
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:41,332
Rym: Bigger heatsink.

653
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:43,458
Scott: Yeah, that's not a matter of overclocking.

654
00:43:43,498 --> 00:43:44,301
Scott: That's just how it is.

655
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:47,550
Rym: Well, arguably it's overclocking because it has the spec.

656
00:43:48,611 --> 00:43:50,099
Scott: It's not about a semantic argument.

657
00:43:50,139 --> 00:43:50,743
Scott: The point is you're not.

658
00:43:51,145 --> 00:43:55,450
Scott: when I say overclocking I mean going be trying to push the chip beyond its spec, right?

659
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:59,370
Scott: It says it's gonna go this fast and you try to make it go even faster than advertised.

660
00:43:59,591 --> 00:44:02,981
Scott: Right that auto scaling with temperature thing is advertised.

661
00:44:03,302 --> 00:44:03,663
Scott: Therefore.

662
00:44:03,703 --> 00:44:06,071
Rym: It's not overclocking what I'm running out right now Let's see.

663
00:44:06,091 --> 00:44:10,167
Rym: So right now my 4 gigahertz CPU is running at.

664
00:44:10,187 --> 00:44:14,196
Rym: that's my RAM Maximum speed 4 gigahertz current speed.

665
00:44:14,497 --> 00:44:19,150
Rym: It's - clocked down to under a gigahertz cuz I ain't doing much right anyway.

666
00:44:19,592 --> 00:44:22,723
Scott: So, you know get if it comes with a heatsink just use that.

667
00:44:22,923 --> 00:44:24,830
Scott: if not get a real standard one.

668
00:44:24,891 --> 00:44:27,474
Scott: Get like one with five stars a new egg But nothing ridiculous.

669
00:44:27,514 --> 00:44:28,618
Scott: that like messes you up right.

670
00:44:28,919 --> 00:44:40,193
Scott: and then your case if standard mid-tower case is what we're talking about here Is probably gonna have to intake fans in the front Outtake fan on the top and an exhaust fan on the top All right, and the

671
00:44:40,273 --> 00:44:41,057
Rym: CPU

672
00:44:41,077 --> 00:44:48,219
Scott: all right and an exhaust fan on the back aiming out Yep And that's gonna be even right for fans to in To out the CPU fan.

673
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:50,510
Scott: the GPU has its own fans and the PSU has own fan.

674
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:55,550
Scott: Now the PS now is enough to cool a modern computer well enough to function.

675
00:44:55,671 --> 00:44:57,861
Rym: I've seen two common designs on the PSU though.

676
00:44:57,921 --> 00:44:59,287
Rym: Some of them will put the PSU in.

677
00:45:00,151 --> 00:45:04,744
Rym: So the PSU is itself static pressure meaning it doesn't affect the pressure right.

678
00:45:04,825 --> 00:45:08,797
Scott: a lot of cases these days have it in like a Separate compartment where it doesn't affect the rest.

679
00:45:08,817 --> 00:45:12,109
Rym: like my PSU sucks in from the bottom outside and out the back.

680
00:45:12,911 --> 00:45:13,433
Scott: That's a good way.

681
00:45:13,654 --> 00:45:15,359
Rym: It's its own loop, but other ones.

682
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:19,412
Scott: make sure the filter on the bond will act as an Exhaust fan.

683
00:45:19,472 --> 00:45:25,250
Rym: so if this PSU is drawing air from the inside of the case it counts as an exhaust fan.

684
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:26,150
Rym: You got to take that into account.

685
00:45:26,251 --> 00:45:29,390
Scott: Yeah, you know, but then you're pulling hot computer air into your PSU.

686
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:32,409
Scott: So make sure you got a real good PSU that can tolerate that hot air.

687
00:45:32,659 --> 00:45:41,770
Rym: Yep Now in the old days used to worry about things especially though with like old and like the AMD chips You would want to worry about like the idea of impinging air flow.

688
00:45:42,192 --> 00:45:52,510
Rym: So you could often make an old case cooler by having the top fan Coming in instead of going out because you'll have better heat exchange there and then have an exhaust fan in the bottom.

689
00:45:53,214 --> 00:45:54,904
Rym: None of that nonsense matters anymore.

690
00:45:54,944 --> 00:45:57,595
Rym: Just do what the cases do And buy a reputable case.

691
00:45:57,816 --> 00:46:00,426
Scott: So another thing that's happened recently is back.

692
00:46:00,506 --> 00:46:01,650
Scott: water cooling is not new.

693
00:46:01,711 --> 00:46:03,146
Scott: I've been seeing water cooling since the 90s.

694
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:09,679
Rym: It used to be only for overclockers and nerds for whom the water cooling is itself And it was always a custom thing.

695
00:46:09,719 --> 00:46:12,130
Scott: like you would buy hoses you would buy a pump, right?

696
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:16,089
Scott: You'd like, you know You would mod your case to attach the pump and get power to it.

697
00:46:16,371 --> 00:46:17,516
Scott: You'd like fill it with like you get.

698
00:46:17,536 --> 00:46:18,359
Scott: you wouldn't use water.

699
00:46:18,379 --> 00:46:23,830
Scott: you do some like sort of cooling liquid and like you People would mess up and get their computers wet and shit, right?

700
00:46:24,311 --> 00:46:30,366
Scott: But more recently this has become a thing that you can do very easily and perhaps even should.

701
00:46:30,446 --> 00:46:30,667
Scott: right.

702
00:46:31,008 --> 00:46:44,870
Scott: if you are building a Computer and you are building something that is top of the line like, you know an a-plus computer like you want horsepower You can buy these cool liquid coolers that come with the case and fit in it perfectly.

703
00:46:45,372 --> 00:46:49,130
Scott: Require, no difficult setup like the liquids already in there, right?

704
00:46:50,013 --> 00:46:51,181
Scott: The hoses are already attached.

705
00:46:51,201 --> 00:46:52,389
Scott: You don't got to worry about anything.

706
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:59,810
Scott: This is basically a radiator and a heatsink part and you just put the radiator in the case where it belongs.

707
00:47:00,191 --> 00:47:07,110
Rym: It just fits in there perfectly and then and the manufacturer will tell you based on the case what direction the fan should point.

708
00:47:08,132 --> 00:47:09,377
Scott: Everything is just automatic.

709
00:47:09,438 --> 00:47:16,365
Scott: and then you take instead of putting a heatsink on your CPU You just take the thing on the other end of the hoses and put that on your CPU.

710
00:47:17,088 --> 00:47:17,630
Scott: and there you go.

711
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:20,750
Scott: You've got this now radiator thing which it comes with fans.

712
00:47:21,231 --> 00:47:28,416
Rym: It's just like all pre-packaged totally easy and the fact that it's liquid cooling doesn't really matter because all this is The.

713
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:31,270
Rym: it's not a heat pipe But it's doing the same kind of thing.

714
00:47:31,451 --> 00:47:39,041
Rym: All it's doing is taking the heat from the CPU and instead of having the heatsink be right there It's sending it to a heatsink that's far away.

715
00:47:39,081 --> 00:47:41,010
Scott: a big heatsink on the front of the case.

716
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:43,069
Scott: Yeah, we're too big-ass fans on it.

717
00:47:43,352 --> 00:47:50,168
Rym: A little heatsink on your CPU CPUs heatsink right at the edge of the case instead of like in the middle of all.

718
00:47:50,188 --> 00:47:50,410
Rym: your not.

719
00:47:50,811 --> 00:47:58,108
Scott: And you got these intake fans pulling the cold air from outside the case right onto that heatsink and that's like Crazy cool in that CP.

720
00:47:58,330 --> 00:48:07,909
Rym: now ideally if you really wanted to make this like super optimal the right way to do that would be to have the heatsink with You know be entirely outside of the case just in its own loop.

721
00:48:08,331 --> 00:48:12,069
Rym: The only reason we don't do that is silly is because that's a pain in the ass for a lot of reasons.

722
00:48:12,652 --> 00:48:21,250
Scott: So basically if you want to go crazy, you can you know have like a refrigerator where the compressor Send the liquid out into a compressor and like cool it off, right?

723
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:23,981
Rym: So but the generally the way these things work.

724
00:48:24,041 --> 00:48:29,149
Rym: if you do unless you're doing something crazy You only need one of these and you're really only needed for the CPU.

725
00:48:29,771 --> 00:48:41,530
Rym: Yeah, because it'll draw air cold air from your room into the case warming it up by cooling the CPU But then that air in the case will be blown out through your normal cooling loop with the fans.

726
00:48:42,273 --> 00:48:44,783
Scott: The best part about this right is something we didn't talk about yet.

727
00:48:44,843 --> 00:48:46,490
Scott: Is that it's way quiet, right?

728
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:48,260
Scott: It's like you're already gonna have.

729
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:54,453
Scott: if you have a fan on your CPU That's probably gonna be among your loudest fans except for maybe your GPU fan Which we'll get to.

730
00:48:54,533 --> 00:48:59,170
Scott: and if you're basically use liquid cooling you eliminate that sound a hundred percent, right?

731
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:02,750
Scott: Even if you get the quietest fan in the world, it's not as quiet as no fan.

732
00:49:03,071 --> 00:49:03,937
Scott: So fan.

733
00:49:04,017 --> 00:49:06,150
Scott: you're gonna have those two intake fans on the front.

734
00:49:06,311 --> 00:49:11,117
Scott: Anyway, whether you got using liquid or not So you just eliminated a whole fan.

735
00:49:11,338 --> 00:49:12,762
Scott: you were saving so much noise.

736
00:49:12,802 --> 00:49:20,244
Rym: the only other where the fans on the heatsink With the liquid cooling because they're not right next to CPU can be way bigger.

737
00:49:20,425 --> 00:49:24,719
Rym: and the two things that influence how loud a fan Are the faster it is louder it is.

738
00:49:24,739 --> 00:49:29,436
Rym: Mm-hmm the bigger it is the quieter It is because it can move slower.

739
00:49:29,958 --> 00:49:33,550
Rym: and by moving slower because as bigger fins move the same amount of air.

740
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:41,226
Scott: Fans are measured in like cubic feet per second Like how much how much feet cubic feet of air can the fan push?

741
00:49:41,246 --> 00:49:42,150
Scott: you've got a bigger fan.

742
00:49:42,551 --> 00:49:43,033
Scott: It spins.

743
00:49:43,254 --> 00:49:47,790
Scott: one time it pushes more air than a little fan spinning like 10. so it can be quiet, right?

744
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:49,617
Scott: So spinning faster is louder.

745
00:49:49,998 --> 00:49:52,528
Scott: bigger fans spin less make less noise.

746
00:49:52,689 --> 00:49:57,350
Scott: also Fancy or more expensive fan up with better bearings are quieter.

747
00:49:57,390 --> 00:50:00,139
Rym: So there's a reason you buy the $40 fans for your.

748
00:50:00,781 --> 00:50:08,710
Scott: if you really the $12 if you really care about quietness You just spend a lot of money and get the highest rated fancy fans like the Noctua's or whatever they are.

749
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:09,693
Scott: Yeah, and those are.

750
00:50:10,175 --> 00:50:13,247
Scott: I think I put two of those in my htbc because that's a computer.

751
00:50:13,267 --> 00:50:18,610
Scott: you want to be quiet And it already had sort of like sad cooling because in a weird htbc case.

752
00:50:18,951 --> 00:50:22,890
Scott: So I wanted to make sure I had really good the best cooling I could get considering limitations.

753
00:50:23,031 --> 00:50:28,533
Scott: Yep, so I put two of the fancy Noctua fans in there and like I never hear them ever now It's very important.

754
00:50:28,553 --> 00:50:30,401
Scott: I think they cost me like 20 or 30 bucks.

755
00:50:30,421 --> 00:50:30,963
Rym: talk about that.

756
00:50:30,983 --> 00:50:31,365
Rym: They were not.

757
00:50:31,385 --> 00:50:32,530
Scott: they were not the cheapest fans.

758
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:33,975
Scott: $5 fans like.

759
00:50:33,995 --> 00:50:37,285
Rym: there are two very different use cases there for the htbc use case.

760
00:50:37,465 --> 00:50:42,267
Rym: one is plays games Generates heat because it's fast and has a video card use case.

761
00:50:42,307 --> 00:50:44,637
Rym: two is You're not playing games on it.

762
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:46,406
Rym: If you're not playing games on it.

763
00:50:46,466 --> 00:50:47,230
Rym: Don't need a video card.

764
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:48,394
Rym: It doesn't need to be super fast.

765
00:50:48,595 --> 00:50:50,662
Rym: You can go with a completely passive solution.

766
00:50:50,682 --> 00:50:53,090
Rym: That'll be literally silence.

767
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:59,970
Rym: Yeah, I mean look like an app but inside your tiny case you love this giant ass block of aluminum crap.

768
00:51:00,111 --> 00:51:01,238
Rym: Just stick it out of your CPU.

769
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:03,029
Rym: What do you care, but it won't make any noise?

770
00:51:04,051 --> 00:51:07,830
Rym: So there are still reasons to have passive cooling in modern computers.

771
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:09,876
Rym: It really depends on how much heat you're generating.

772
00:51:10,257 --> 00:51:17,030
Rym: more heat is generated by either having video cards or having fast chips doing stuff All right, so we talked about GPU fans a little bit.

773
00:51:17,111 --> 00:51:20,798
Scott: But you know when you go to buy a GPU You're gonna see different kinds of fans on them.

774
00:51:20,838 --> 00:51:21,841
Scott: a lot of them these days.

775
00:51:21,922 --> 00:51:24,110
Scott: the high-end ones will have like three fans on there.

776
00:51:24,270 --> 00:51:29,696
Scott: Well, some of them will have two fans and some of them will have like this weird blowy fan That's totally sideways and different.

777
00:51:29,897 --> 00:51:32,388
Rym: So the weird blowy fan or the turbine or whatever.

778
00:51:32,408 --> 00:51:34,315
Rym: Mm-hmm You pretty much don't want that.

779
00:51:34,656 --> 00:51:38,650
Rym: Usually those will be called like the founders edition or the reference edition?

780
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:40,329
Scott: Well, no that has nothing to do with the fan.

781
00:51:41,174 --> 00:51:44,410
Rym: Usually though so the reference editions always have that weird turbine fan.

782
00:51:44,430 --> 00:51:51,172
Scott: The reference edition is just means that like we're gonna charge you more for this and like this is the original Nvidia design Something.

783
00:51:51,313 --> 00:51:59,210
Rym: but as best I can tell the only reason they have that weird turbine fan is Because of a convention where the reference editions always have that.

784
00:52:00,035 --> 00:52:02,490
Rym: I think it's like three articles about this.

785
00:52:03,373 --> 00:52:06,462
Scott: I've never seen any connection between the fan style and the found.

786
00:52:06,582 --> 00:52:09,030
Rym: every reference edition has the turbine.

787
00:52:09,412 --> 00:52:16,703
Rym: Anyway, so and the reason for that is nonsense The turbine fans are one just louder and two.

788
00:52:17,104 --> 00:52:19,050
Rym: they count as an exhaust fan.

789
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:21,458
Rym: They pull air in from your case.

790
00:52:21,498 --> 00:52:22,261
Rym: Just like that PSU.

791
00:52:22,281 --> 00:52:24,950
Rym: I was talking about and blow it out the back, right?

792
00:52:25,971 --> 00:52:26,513
Rym: And they suck.

793
00:52:26,714 --> 00:52:29,764
Scott: I actually intentionally got the turbine fan on the 1070 in my HTPC.

794
00:52:31,571 --> 00:52:35,287
Scott: Cuz the HTPC is way narrow and there's no if I got the regular.

795
00:52:35,528 --> 00:52:41,109
Scott: Oh, yeah Cuz the right, okay I got the regular two or three fans where the hell they blowing just down.

796
00:52:41,592 --> 00:52:49,450
Scott: Cuz it's a. it's a weird case where the video card is like sideways And those fans be blowing at the ground and then the hot air would rise right back into them.

797
00:52:49,594 --> 00:52:52,601
Scott: Yep And so I got the blowy fan to make sure it blows out the back.

798
00:52:52,942 --> 00:53:01,298
Rym: now the regular fan the ones you're thinking of where There's like two or three big like case looking fans on it that those are a lot quieter Usually.

799
00:53:01,318 --> 00:53:02,590
Scott: yeah, you got three fans on there.

800
00:53:02,590 --> 00:53:09,650
Rym: They don't need to spin very fast But they work a lot like an old CPU cooler did in that they're just blowing air inside your case to cool it down.

801
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:12,008
Rym: So you gotta make sure the case is still getting the hot air out of the.

802
00:53:12,029 --> 00:53:22,650
Scott: yeah usually you're gonna have you know cool air coming right across the bottom of the case in the front and out the back and That's gonna go right past that GPU and take that hot air that those plans blow right out the back.

803
00:53:23,093 --> 00:53:32,353
Rym: So I would generally recommend Get the fan that had the the GPU that has two or three normal looking fans on it and not the turbine unless you have A good reason to.

804
00:53:32,774 --> 00:53:35,524
Rym: the third way to go is passive which is just for like.

805
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:36,166
Rym: like.

806
00:53:36,246 --> 00:53:38,970
Rym: if you're doing passive cooling Why do you even have a video card?

807
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:50,210
Scott: You can probably get away with using your like Intel like a core whatever You know you can get like you know like 1050s and stuff or like you know weaker video cards that can still do stuff that some of them only have like one fan.

808
00:53:50,531 --> 00:53:52,358
Scott: You know this you'd be surprised.

809
00:53:52,378 --> 00:53:55,490
Scott: like the kind of video card you can get that's got one fan or no fans.

810
00:53:55,550 --> 00:53:59,290
Scott: It is pretty significantly powerful faster even than the integrated graphics.

811
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:00,615
Rym: But the other kind is.

812
00:54:00,635 --> 00:54:13,350
Rym: you do the same thing just like we talked about with liquid cooling the CPU Where there's no fans on the GPU and instead it again Just has a two pipes or two tubes and a separate fin thing to be the heat sink.

813
00:54:13,451 --> 00:54:22,230
Scott: So sometimes you can buy a video card that already has this yep Or you can buy a video card and somehow take the fans off and attach one of these which is doable.

814
00:54:22,532 --> 00:54:29,948
Rym: But as I wouldn't recommend that right in general You don't need to liquid cool your GPU if you only have one GPU.

815
00:54:29,968 --> 00:54:44,709
Rym: my My straight-up recommendation if you have a fast computer liquid cool the CPU And then the only things generating heat in the case directly are the GPU and all those heat sinks All of your motherboard for all those chips and your RAM.

816
00:54:45,151 --> 00:54:51,830
Scott: Let's think about once you you know every when you cool that CPU with the liquid cooling you're helping out the GPU, right?

817
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:54,282
Scott: There's less heat in the case now, right?

818
00:54:54,443 --> 00:54:55,790
Scott: You're just helping everybody, right?

819
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:56,995
Scott: So it's like oh the GPU.

820
00:54:57,055 --> 00:54:59,687
Scott: you might have been struggling if the CPU is poorly cooled.

821
00:54:59,727 --> 00:55:00,390
Scott: heating up this case.

822
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:03,930
Rym: Yes, the G is pumping hot air directly into your video card.

823
00:55:03,950 --> 00:55:08,509
Scott: But now I brought I brought down the case temperature with my superior cooling in another area.

824
00:55:09,031 --> 00:55:12,043
Scott: So now the cooling of the GPU is now doing even better.

825
00:55:12,184 --> 00:55:18,717
Rym: It's everyone works together now Irrespective of whether or not SLI and multiple video cards is a good idea.

826
00:55:19,439 --> 00:55:20,422
Rym: if you're doing that.

827
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:23,029
Rym: that is the use case for the liquid cooled GPU.

828
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:24,418
Scott: Yeah, and for no other reason.

829
00:55:24,458 --> 00:55:28,090
Scott: when you put two video cards next to each other You want two video cards pumping air through each other?

830
00:55:28,813 --> 00:55:31,430
Scott: One of them is gonna be blowing its hot air onto the back of the other one.

831
00:55:31,471 --> 00:55:37,732
Scott: Yeah, right You want a liquid cool the one that would be blowing on its friend and let the friend blow on the bottom of the case Or whatever.

832
00:55:37,772 --> 00:55:42,810
Scott: right and then that way you protect the bottom card from the card that's next to it now.

833
00:55:43,271 --> 00:55:55,054
Scott: That being said I have seen setups at like conventions and packs or whatever where like Ati's got like a booth or something and they got like four GPUs in the same box and they all had fans and they all Work just fine.

834
00:55:55,134 --> 00:55:55,878
Scott: It could totally work.

835
00:55:55,898 --> 00:55:58,470
Scott: Yeah, it's just probably, you know, not for the best.

836
00:55:59,092 --> 00:56:02,688
Rym: So the other cooling that you might hear occasionally a lot of people don't really understand.

837
00:56:02,708 --> 00:56:03,110
Rym: with these hours.

838
00:56:03,170 --> 00:56:09,550
Rym: You'll see you'll hear about my heat pipe or you'll see like pipes all over your motherboard Which wasn't a thing a long time ago.

839
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:10,273
Rym: It's happening more and more.

840
00:56:10,314 --> 00:56:13,790
Rym: the problem is the chips that do stuff like it, you know in the old days.

841
00:56:14,711 --> 00:56:20,850
Rym: Yeah, it's actually it's gotten so much more complicated than that, but it also doesn't matter like it's a chipset now.

842
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:27,743
Rym: It used to worry about that a lot because like certain North bridges wouldn't be compatible with certain things But nowadays none of that matters.

843
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:28,650
Rym: you don't worry about it.

844
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:31,830
Scott: Well, you do have to choose the right chipset, but you don't care which chips are in the set.

845
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:33,719
Scott: All you got to know is that oh, I got the Z 270.

846
00:56:33,719 --> 00:56:34,181
Scott: Okay.

847
00:56:34,201 --> 00:56:38,657
Scott: Yeah, I got an Intel H whatever it is.

848
00:56:38,778 --> 00:56:40,246
Scott: I know I know what chipset I have.

849
00:56:40,266 --> 00:56:40,890
Scott: That's all you got to know.

850
00:56:40,910 --> 00:56:42,309
Scott: You don't got to know what chips are in the chipset.

851
00:56:42,410 --> 00:56:48,930
Rym: But all those different parts of the motherboard and the RAM Actually generate a lot of heat these days because a lot's going on in there.

852
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:51,289
Scott: They don't generate so much heat that they need a fan of their own.

853
00:56:51,551 --> 00:56:52,617
Rym: But they need heat sink.

854
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:56,577
Scott: the motherboards thin at the mother But the motherboard includes those right.

855
00:56:56,657 --> 00:56:58,423
Scott: they're gonna just have heat sinks on them.

856
00:56:58,443 --> 00:57:01,952
Scott: Yeah already built into the motherboard You don't even think about it It's just there.

857
00:57:02,073 --> 00:57:07,561
Rym: but if you see all those pipes all those are doing is they're doing what the liquid cool Would do but they're passive.

858
00:57:07,621 --> 00:57:19,516
Rym: instead of having a pump Literally pumping liquid through the heat sink, you know Through all these channels inside of it and through all these channels on the puck on top of the CPU They're passive.

859
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:28,349
Rym: They basically will have a liquid evaporating and moving to one end of the pipe and it'll transfer the heat from the hot side to the cold side right.

860
00:57:28,369 --> 00:57:33,633
Scott: you got a Whole bunch of chips in a set and some of those chips are gonna be hotter than others depending on what's going on with The computer.

861
00:57:33,653 --> 00:57:50,350
Scott: and so it's like oh you got this heat sink on this one chip But it's not doing much because that chips not hot But meanwhile this other chip is crazy hot right now and it's heat sink is like, you know It's adding it's gonna be adequate But why not link it together with these other heat sinks and that way they can all sort of share the load.

862
00:57:50,611 --> 00:57:58,610
Scott: It also means long as they don't all get crazy hot at once Each one of them is now being cooled better than it otherwise would be and now your computer lasts longer.

863
00:57:58,730 --> 00:58:04,190
Rym: It's also important because you'll often have an area of the motherboard that's further away from stuff.

864
00:58:04,210 --> 00:58:08,297
Rym: We have more room to put a big heat sink But the area that's actually hot.

865
00:58:08,678 --> 00:58:11,647
Rym: you can't put a bunch of heat sinks and crap there because proximity matters.

866
00:58:11,707 --> 00:58:17,084
Rym: computers are so performant These days that the distance between components actually does matter.

867
00:58:17,485 --> 00:58:27,109
Rym: That's why they design them the way they do You know pump all that heat from the hot area to a further away less valuable real estate on the motherboard And that's you can have the heat sink some fancy motherboards.

868
00:58:27,752 --> 00:58:43,090
Rym: So because basically if you're doing a super high performance computer and you've got the you know The second GPU with liquid cooling and the CPU with liquid cooling at that point You're better off having both of those use the same cooling loop and that's when the complicated crap happens.

869
00:58:43,150 --> 00:58:44,890
Scott: Yeah that you had to do effort to make that happen.

870
00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:47,197
Scott: That's not something you can just buy easily because if

871
00:58:47,217 --> 00:59:00,239
Rym: you're going that road some motherboards will actually have on the motherboard two little headers And you plug those into your cooling loop and the same thing that's cool in the CPU in the GPU Will also cool all the things on the motherboard.

872
00:59:00,279 --> 00:59:02,285
Rym: There's channels built into the motherboard.

873
00:59:02,826 --> 00:59:04,070
Rym: That is crazy nonsense.

874
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:07,200
Rym: You probably don't need anything like that.

875
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:09,510
Scott: It's like there's all this stuff and you think do I need that?

876
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:09,791
Scott: It's like.

877
00:59:09,851 --> 00:59:12,064
Scott: no that's just for people who like make this their hobby.

878
00:59:12,124 --> 00:59:13,090
Scott: It's not for normal people.

879
00:59:13,291 --> 00:59:15,419
Rym: Yep, but don't be afraid of liquid cooling.

880
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:21,642
Rym: I highly recommend if you have a modern fast computer and You're the CPU you buy doesn't come with a heatsink.

881
00:59:21,964 --> 00:59:23,229
Rym: buy the liquid cooling one.

882
00:59:23,973 --> 00:59:30,058
Scott: If you can't make sure you get a case and the cooling thing that go together Yeah All the same manufacturer from the same company.

883
00:59:30,118 --> 00:59:35,409
Scott: if you try to buy like one liquid coolie thing and put it in a different case You're gonna have a bad time, right?

884
00:59:35,830 --> 00:59:36,694
Scott: Yeah, these things are not.

885
00:59:36,714 --> 00:59:39,890
Scott: there's not like a standard for these so much as there is for other things.

886
00:59:40,331 --> 00:59:45,249
Scott: So you want to make sure you get a nice, you know a set pair and everything will go very easily for you.

887
00:59:46,473 --> 00:59:55,177
Rym: And otherwise, I mean as long as you buy a nice case Cables got small you don't have to worry about ribbon cables like literally Redirecting air and causing hot spots.

888
00:59:55,277 --> 00:59:58,170
Scott: modern cases like show you where you're supposed to route the cables.

889
00:59:58,270 --> 01:00:01,283
Scott: But even if you just do a big mess, it's not they're not.

890
01:00:01,444 --> 01:00:03,010
Scott: I guess it's not a big ribbon cable.

891
01:00:03,070 --> 01:00:04,156
Scott: It's not blocking anything.

892
01:00:04,216 --> 01:00:11,208
Scott: It's really not going to affect your airflow that much Yep, and nowadays all the PS use I have like they let you they're modular.

893
01:00:11,228 --> 01:00:11,730
Scott: Yeah, they let you.

894
01:00:13,072 --> 01:00:13,636
Rym: Don't plug them in.

895
01:00:13,676 --> 01:00:15,590
Scott: you don't have a big mess of cables in there hurting you.

896
01:00:15,891 --> 01:00:22,420
Rym: Actually cut a bunch of cables off of a PSU a long time ago And I sort of like wrapped him up and got him out of the way.

897
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:29,347
Rym: and I used to cut ribbon cables for my hard Drives, you know take a razor and cut along all the lines and they could bundle them.

898
01:00:29,387 --> 01:00:31,800
Scott: So they'd be out of the way Yeah, but weren't they flat for a reason?

899
01:00:32,021 --> 01:00:33,470
Rym: Yeah, they were it was it was they did.

900
01:00:33,610 --> 01:00:34,834
Rym: Sometimes it worked sometimes it did.

901
01:00:34,854 --> 01:00:39,450
Scott: there were definitely some ribbon cables that I got I remember like towards the latter days of IDE.

902
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:51,550
Scott: I would buy you buy a hard drive to come with a ribbon cable that was already bundled like yeah, and I'm like, alright Whatever it worked and in terms of hard drives and everything like they do generate heat.

903
01:00:52,051 --> 01:00:59,770
Scott: They usually every everything generates heat but like SSDs even magnetic drives They don't need to be cooled, right?

904
01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:07,537
Rym: Well modern cases will place them in in in areas where they will get enough cooling As long as you do what the case said to do.

905
01:01:07,698 --> 01:01:08,280
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

906
01:01:08,681 --> 01:01:11,070
Scott: you don't have to put fans on them or anything.

907
01:01:11,070 --> 01:01:12,958
Scott: It's like, you know back in the day that used to be.

908
01:01:12,978 --> 01:01:17,834
Scott: I think I actually did have at one point This super long ago.

909
01:01:17,854 --> 01:01:19,358
Scott: This is the Pentium three, right?

910
01:01:19,378 --> 01:01:27,143
Scott: No had which at the time was crazy a sea gate 7200 rpm drive.

911
01:01:27,445 --> 01:01:34,647
Scott: Oh Right, so that was so many rpms then oh my god, I think it was four gigabytes this drive.

912
01:01:34,688 --> 01:01:38,656
Scott: it was insane And you know that was.

913
01:01:38,716 --> 01:01:40,120
Scott: that was too fast.

914
01:01:40,261 --> 01:01:41,965
Scott: this needed its own cooling right.

915
01:01:41,986 --> 01:01:45,060
Scott: you couldn't just put this drive in with the other Drive, this is gonna be like set on fire.

916
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:46,730
Scott: I wanted this drive to last a long time.

917
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:48,577
Scott: It was expensive and high quality.

918
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:51,670
Scott: So, you know top of the line magnetic hard drive here.

919
01:01:52,052 --> 01:01:54,670
Scott: So I bought a thing that was a giant heatsink.

920
01:01:55,151 --> 01:02:05,950
Scott: You put the hard drive in there and had fans two little fans on the front and then you put the hard drive into a five And a quarter slot instead of a three and a half slot and now that hard drive is gonna be so cool.

921
01:02:07,691 --> 01:02:14,523
Rym: Most cases will just have the hard drives in a place where the intake fans Like that air will just kind of wash over room and that'll be enough.

922
01:02:14,724 --> 01:02:18,988
Scott: Yeah, but I Probably didn't need that thing back in the day, but I had it.

923
01:02:19,270 --> 01:02:24,709
Rym: Yeah well also back then like cases sucked and there were a lot of hot spots and like that was a that's still a big.

924
01:02:24,830 --> 01:02:32,810
Scott: I Don't think I needed to put my three and a half inch hard drive in the five and a quarter slot with its own Enormous heatsink with its own two tiny fans.

925
01:02:33,293 --> 01:02:34,664
Rym: It's hard to say like I'd like.

926
01:02:34,866 --> 01:02:35,390
Scott: we know a lot.

927
01:02:35,450 --> 01:02:38,061
Scott: I couldn't say I could have saved that money when I was younger.

928
01:02:38,463 --> 01:02:41,389
Scott: maybe used it on something better like food.

929
01:02:43,091 --> 01:02:44,739
Rym: So, uh, it's actually like.

930
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:56,096
Rym: it's interesting how it got more complicated But at the same time like just in the last four or five years, I'd say in terms of actually building computers It's way easier.

931
01:02:56,156 --> 01:03:06,215
Rym: I think the worst time was about six to ten years ago Where you started to have advanced cooling needs, but there weren't a lot of good off-the-shelf Solutions.

932
01:03:06,315 --> 01:03:09,050
Scott: the need the needs and the problem are more difficult than ever.

933
01:03:09,070 --> 01:03:13,749
Scott: There's more heat than ever but the products you can buy just solve the problem for you.

934
01:03:14,050 --> 01:03:17,232
Scott: Yeah, and you don't need to think about it or work hard at it You didn't.

935
01:03:17,252 --> 01:03:23,950
Rym: you know like you used to is you only need to work hard if you're already doing weird stuff and you're already Edging into set like hobbyist nonsense, right?

936
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:29,410
Scott: If you're not a hobbyist like the off-the-shelf stuff just by the default and it's gonna work great and it's totally awesome.

937
01:03:29,715 --> 01:03:35,927
Rym: but seriously Positive pressure and have intake filters if your computer doesn't.

938
01:03:35,947 --> 01:03:36,610
Rym: not too positive.

939
01:03:36,951 --> 01:03:38,419
Scott: Oh just slightly positive.

940
01:03:38,519 --> 01:03:44,822
Rym: if your computer does not have intake filters You should dust the hell out of your computer with an air And get filters on there.

941
01:03:44,842 --> 01:03:48,199
Scott: and if you don't have filters You can just stretch some pantyhose over the front of those intake fan.

942
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:48,982
Rym: Yeah, that works.

943
01:03:49,223 --> 01:03:50,026
Scott: It works crazy.

944
01:03:50,066 --> 01:03:50,970
Scott: Well, and it's so cheap.

945
01:03:51,191 --> 01:03:53,610
Rym: Yeah, it's like nothing like that changed my life.

946
01:03:53,811 --> 01:03:57,667
Rym: I did that to my computer two times ago, and then I never had to dust it again.

947
01:03:57,687 --> 01:03:58,330
Rym: It was just amazing.

948
01:03:58,551 --> 01:03:59,575
Rym: Yeah, just every month.

949
01:03:59,977 --> 01:04:01,805
Rym: I would literally I didn't even clean the pantyhose.

950
01:04:02,026 --> 01:04:02,709
Rym: I would just replace it.

951
01:04:03,412 --> 01:04:04,519
Scott: I mean, yeah, I have filters.

952
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:08,216
Scott: the filters on my computers are Magnated on so are mine.

953
01:04:08,236 --> 01:04:15,310
Scott: They're just like this you turn your computer off you peel them off you go outside You shake them and yep, I just whack them on the balcony all the dust falls off.

954
01:04:15,631 --> 01:04:19,668
Scott: You can also take a can of compressed air and spray them and then just slap them back on there.

955
01:04:19,829 --> 01:04:21,516
Scott: done Do it like once every few months.

956
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:24,288
Rym: Yep, and in terms of just you know, I'll mention it.

957
01:04:24,328 --> 01:04:26,720
Rym: laptops They cool themselves.

958
01:04:26,962 --> 01:04:28,510
Scott: don't mess with the laptop cooling.

959
01:04:28,731 --> 01:04:32,745
Scott: Yeah, but if you see a laptop is blowing a lot and is making a lot of noise.

960
01:04:32,765 --> 01:04:34,270
Scott: I don't buy that laptop.

961
01:04:34,391 --> 01:04:35,318
Scott: That's a crappy one.

962
01:04:35,339 --> 01:04:36,629
Scott: That's bad cooling design.

963
01:04:36,911 --> 01:04:37,573
Rym: Well, I mean it like.

964
01:04:37,594 --> 01:04:38,015
Rym: so might like.

965
01:04:38,035 --> 01:04:41,570
Rym: I have a Lenovo x230 which is still a great laptop like even today like it'll place.

966
01:04:41,650 --> 01:04:45,049
Rym: If six, okay, which is still kind of amazing me that'll totally pull that off.

967
01:04:45,511 --> 01:04:51,688
Rym: but if I start playing Civ six and that's this fan that usually isn't spinning and suddenly it spins.

968
01:04:51,728 --> 01:04:59,128
Rym: you hear this like An air hot enough to be uncomfortable is coming out of the side of this tiny laptop.

969
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:00,913
Scott: Mm-hmm That's not good.

970
01:05:01,154 --> 01:05:01,375
Rym: Yeah.

971
01:05:01,415 --> 01:05:02,940
Scott: Well, I mean it's gonna die.

972
01:05:03,181 --> 01:05:03,863
Rym: I think it'll be fine.

973
01:05:03,903 --> 01:05:04,344
Scott: It's good day.

974
01:05:05,067 --> 01:05:06,714
Rym: It's uh, it'll be fine It's gonna die.

975
01:05:06,734 --> 01:05:07,981
Rym: that laptop is so old.

976
01:05:08,021 --> 01:05:08,826
Rym: Like I'm shocked.

977
01:05:08,866 --> 01:05:09,410
Rym: It still works.

978
01:05:15,322 --> 01:05:17,860
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
