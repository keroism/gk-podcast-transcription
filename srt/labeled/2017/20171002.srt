1
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,128
Rym: It's Monday October 2nd 2017.

2
00:00:05,128 --> 00:00:05,409
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:05,429 --> 00:00:12,733
Rym: I am Scott and this is spooky GeekNights.

4
00:00:12,793 --> 00:00:13,515
Rym: It's tonight.

5
00:00:13,857 --> 00:00:17,438
Rym: We're talking about terrors of technology.

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:32,462
Scott: All right, so yesterday was October the first You go apple picking.

7
00:00:32,603 --> 00:00:35,704
Scott: Yeah, so Originally, it was like hey, let's go apple picking.

8
00:00:35,724 --> 00:00:42,258
Scott: then it's like wait a minute Let me search for the best place to go apple picking cuz usually when we live upstate It's like oh we go to the nearby apple pick.

9
00:00:42,318 --> 00:00:45,470
Rym: Yeah, like just drive north and you hit apple field, right?

10
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:53,797
Scott: So you just go to the one nearby and they're all mostly all have everything you want because everything you want is cider and Cider doughnuts.

11
00:00:53,817 --> 00:00:55,129
Scott: I had a doughnut and apples.

12
00:00:55,451 --> 00:01:03,007
Scott: those are the three things you want and every single one of the places has those three things and some of them have a Maze and maybe you want the maze or maybe not and you get a pumpkin.

13
00:01:03,027 --> 00:01:03,530
Scott: All right, whatever.

14
00:01:03,651 --> 00:01:06,290
Rym: Yep, sometimes you buy some maze because we're in the city.

15
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,220
Scott: I had like pick one out like which place is the best apple?

16
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,103
Rym: or you know what?

17
00:01:10,123 --> 00:01:14,273
Rym: that's actually a tricky proposition because remember They all have delicious Apple.

18
00:01:14,313 --> 00:01:22,330
Rym: that time when we were we took the taconic home from upstate back to New York instead of Going the normal way on the throughway and then we saw that farmer's stand.

19
00:01:22,351 --> 00:01:30,536
Rym: We're like, oh shit We stopped and bought some stuff and then we passed like ten more farmer stands that were all way better than the one that we Stopped to had delicious apples.

20
00:01:30,717 --> 00:01:32,405
Rym: Yeah, but the other ones had more.

21
00:01:32,465 --> 00:01:33,430
Rym: it looked fancier.

22
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,722
Scott: Yeah, the farmers invested more in the construction of their stand.

23
00:01:36,802 --> 00:01:38,790
Rym: Anyway made the mistake of going to the first one.

24
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,085
Scott: So I discovered though the Warwick Apple Fest.

25
00:01:42,105 --> 00:01:46,341
Scott: so Warwick is a town I've been looking at because it's near some lake houses, which I've been investigating.

26
00:01:46,361 --> 00:01:48,910
Scott: Yeah, so I'm like, oh well, there's a giant Apple Fest.

27
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,338
Scott: It's like the biggest Apple Fest ever every year.

28
00:01:51,839 --> 00:01:52,822
Scott: Let's go check it out.

29
00:01:52,902 --> 00:01:55,350
Scott: So I'm just gonna quickly talk about what happened there.

30
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,741
Scott: So the Apple Fest itself is pretty much the way you phrase that.

31
00:01:58,782 --> 00:02:00,267
Rym: let's talk about what happened there.

32
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:05,102
Scott: Oh, yeah, so The Warwick Apple Fest is like 99% white people.

33
00:02:05,122 --> 00:02:12,130
Scott: That's okay And you know what for it is upstate New York for an Apple Fest.

34
00:02:12,512 --> 00:02:14,987
Scott: There are surprisingly few apples at the Apple Fest.

35
00:02:15,027 --> 00:02:15,430
Scott: there were deaf.

36
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:21,090
Scott: You could definitely get a pie there or a cider or whatever, but not a lot of apples at the Apple Fest.

37
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:26,350
Scott: It's mostly craft fair local businesses people taking advantage of the fact the Apple Fest is happening.

38
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:30,190
Scott: So they're throwing a tag sale on their front lawn because their houses in like a great position.

39
00:02:30,674 --> 00:02:32,310
Scott: You know the church is in such a great position.

40
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,843
Scott: So the church leaders are out selling apple butter on the street.

41
00:02:35,145 --> 00:02:36,010
Rym: make sense, you know.

42
00:02:37,311 --> 00:02:41,070
Scott: So the thing is when you think about those townie fairs, they usually kind of small.

43
00:02:41,612 --> 00:02:48,102
Scott: This was like them, you know, it didn't have any different stuff than other townie fairs But it was substantial and crowded.

44
00:02:48,283 --> 00:02:52,607
Scott: for one of those townie fairs Like whoa, you needed to park in the high school and take a shuttle bus.

45
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:54,516
Scott: Wow It was hard to walk down the street.

46
00:02:54,556 --> 00:03:02,664
Scott: It sounds like the Awaka festival back in Leroy and it took like Set more than two hours to see all the stuff and there was some good stuff.

47
00:03:02,825 --> 00:03:03,086
Scott: Actually.

48
00:03:03,106 --> 00:03:04,612
Scott: There's an old lady who was way Awesome.

49
00:03:04,732 --> 00:03:11,910
Scott: She was from New Jersey and what she does is she collects t-shirts and sweatshirts All right, and when she gets enough of them that are all sort of go together.

50
00:03:12,354 --> 00:03:27,191
Scott: She sews them together into a quilt and I needed a new couch blanket and she happened to have one that had like 12 New York Rangers together from our failed Stanley Cup finals in 2014-15. ish.

51
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:30,675
Scott: So I'm like, oh whatever.

52
00:03:31,037 --> 00:03:32,121
Scott: It's better than the shitty blanket.

53
00:03:32,142 --> 00:03:32,664
Scott: I got now.

54
00:03:32,965 --> 00:03:33,929
Scott: It's actually way warm.

55
00:03:34,633 --> 00:03:40,335
Scott: So, you know anyway, so that was good, but then it's like well We wanted to go up.

56
00:03:40,376 --> 00:03:45,793
Scott: We wanted actual apples, right and we couldn't really get any at the Apple Festival Oddly enough.

57
00:03:45,914 --> 00:03:47,119
Rym: Well, yeah, I see mostly pictures.

58
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,530
Rym: only the only pictures there are pictures of the pie contest.

59
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:55,230
Scott: Yeah, there's a pie contest eating and also baking But we didn't hang around for that anyway.

60
00:03:56,411 --> 00:04:02,090
Scott: So I had previously researched right just in case I thought of this like what if we can't get apples at the Apple Fest?

61
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:07,660
Scott: So I researched the best nearby Apple pickin which was a place called massacre orchards.

62
00:04:07,761 --> 00:04:11,010
Scott: like a person who wears a mask or a person who makes a mask?

63
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:11,512
Scott: I don't know.

64
00:04:12,114 --> 00:04:22,010
Scott: So you go to massacre orchards and if I found out hmm Maybe massacre orchards isn't so good because apparently it was the only one that lets you drive right up to the tree.

65
00:04:22,593 --> 00:04:25,750
Rym: Oh, and I'm like, oh that's that's that's a bad sign.

66
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:29,541
Scott: So I'm thinking that's a place for lazy people to go apple picking.

67
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:35,750
Scott: not a because normally you park walk out get apples and walk Back, yeah half the fun is just like walking around outside in the apple orchard.

68
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:44,982
Scott: But actually while that is true that massacre orchards was an apple orchard for lazy people It was actually the most happen in apple orchard.

69
00:04:45,062 --> 00:04:47,210
Rym: Oh, look they publish their ripening schedule.

70
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,880
Scott: Yeah, they just let you like dry cuz.

71
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,290
Scott: they just let you drive the fuck right up to the tree, right?

72
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:55,982
Scott: Yeah, but actually not only that they just let you have free range.

73
00:04:56,023 --> 00:04:56,966
Scott: Like it's a public park.

74
00:04:57,006 --> 00:04:58,434
Scott: They don't give a shit Right.

75
00:04:58,637 --> 00:05:09,550
Scott: So people basically People who knew better about massacre orchards were literally just driving up their like SUVs or pickup trucks Opening up the back and having picnics all day in the apple orchard.

76
00:05:10,531 --> 00:05:13,450
Scott: And you can eat an apple in the apple orchard and they don't give a shit, right?

77
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:14,033
Scott: You just can't.

78
00:05:14,194 --> 00:05:18,515
Scott: if you leave though, they search your car for apples And you got to pay.

79
00:05:18,576 --> 00:05:21,269
Scott: so it's $30 a bag when you leave with apples, right?

80
00:05:23,551 --> 00:05:26,783
Scott: But also they had you know, the country store area, right?

81
00:05:27,485 --> 00:05:32,745
Scott: So in the country store area They had the cider donuts which were great, but not like the best ever, right?

82
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:39,403
Scott: They also had Pizza which I didn't eat because I didn't know about it, but it looked.

83
00:05:39,945 --> 00:05:41,170
Scott: it didn't look like New York Pizza.

84
00:05:41,612 --> 00:05:50,650
Scott: It was like a fluffy square kind of pizza, but whether you want to even call it pizza It still looked like a legendary pizza if you were buying them like crazy, right?

85
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,055
Scott: And cider.

86
00:05:53,115 --> 00:06:06,330
Scott: so I waited in line cuz you know I went to the into the country store area where you can buy pick up something go to the register and It was so crowded at this place That like that country store didn't have apple cider.

87
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:14,950
Scott: You had to go up wait in this line to get apple cider and that was the same line to also get pizza and donuts And ice cream and pie by the slice with ice cream on it.

88
00:06:16,373 --> 00:06:20,155
Scott: And while I was waiting in line the power went out At the little state so I couldn't.

89
00:06:20,195 --> 00:06:29,150
Scott: I was like waiting in this huge line just to get cider and then only I found out As we were leaving That when you pay for the app, oh, yeah, you can just get cider with the exit.

90
00:06:29,812 --> 00:06:31,057
Scott: You can get cider at the exit.

91
00:06:31,077 --> 00:06:32,643
Scott: they didn't tell me that in advance Scott.

92
00:06:32,663 --> 00:06:34,470
Rym: that's in like their main fact.

93
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:35,717
Scott: Yeah on the website.

94
00:06:35,737 --> 00:06:39,439
Scott: There was nowhere at the orchard to figure that out But anyway, so I made a mistake.

95
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,110
Rym: so you went to a place without going to the website.

96
00:06:41,411 --> 00:06:45,210
Scott: I went to the website just say what is best app orchard anyway, even talk about the pizza.

97
00:06:45,511 --> 00:06:50,125
Scott: Yeah, so if you want to go to the most happen an apple orchard.

98
00:06:50,226 --> 00:06:54,887
Scott: Oh, I forgot the most important part The Apple Festival which is in the same town as its orchard.

99
00:06:54,928 --> 00:06:58,610
Scott: by the way The orchard had no presence at the festival other than advertising in the guidebook.

100
00:06:59,732 --> 00:07:06,784
Scott: The Apple Festival is 99% of white people the apple orchard 90-plus percent not a white people.

101
00:07:06,804 --> 00:07:08,848
Rym: Oh What is up with that?

102
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:14,690
Scott: What can you explain the not white people who are all happy to know that you should just go to the apple orchard and have?

103
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:15,172
Scott: A picnic.

104
00:07:15,192 --> 00:07:16,257
Rym: I don't know the Fed.

105
00:07:16,338 --> 00:07:17,101
Rym: It's a white.

106
00:07:17,142 --> 00:07:20,376
Rym: sounds like it's got a lot of that sort of country.

107
00:07:20,397 --> 00:07:21,913
Rym: kitsch Feel.

108
00:07:21,933 --> 00:07:23,238
Scott: yeah, I don't know.

109
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:26,068
Scott: It was definitely, you know, it was a festival.

110
00:07:26,228 --> 00:07:26,569
Scott: It was fine.

111
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,175
Scott: The festival doesn't?

112
00:07:28,195 --> 00:07:29,782
Scott: it's not a thing that I think you need to repeat.

113
00:07:30,265 --> 00:07:39,449
Rym: Yeah, but on one hand I love apple picking but on the other hand Because I have an oral allergy to pollen and apple skins a lot of the joys of apple picking are lost on me.

114
00:07:40,212 --> 00:07:42,881
Rym: Cuz I can't just eat apples like I used to when I was young.

115
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:45,230
Rym: Mm-hmm, but I can cook them and bake them.

116
00:07:45,812 --> 00:07:49,465
Rym: But if I get even one bag of apples, he just cleaned the apple.

117
00:07:49,485 --> 00:07:52,421
Scott: cuz the pollen just clean the pot So it impregnates the skin.

118
00:07:52,441 --> 00:07:53,105
Rym: I have to peel.

119
00:07:53,165 --> 00:07:54,974
Rym: I can peel them And then I can eat them.

120
00:07:54,994 --> 00:07:57,985
Rym: just fine or I can make the skin is so delicious.

121
00:07:58,146 --> 00:07:59,090
Rym: that's the problem.

122
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:06,350
Rym: Whatever occasionally I'll eat apples But usually I got to go to a place where I know there aren't birch trees and easel crumbed and then ate apple.

123
00:08:06,973 --> 00:08:10,814
Rym: Uh, well, so if I eat an apple, it won't kill me and it's not like an allergy Like I'll get puffed up.

124
00:08:11,155 --> 00:08:14,850
Rym: basically my throat will swell up and make it hard to swallow for like four hours.

125
00:08:15,372 --> 00:08:16,008
Rym: Hmm, that's it.

126
00:08:16,172 --> 00:08:17,974
Rym: But it doesn't get worse than that No matter how many apples.

127
00:08:18,055 --> 00:08:21,090
Scott: I have you a problem because you'd eat an apple and then you'd go to the country store.

128
00:08:21,412 --> 00:08:28,378
Scott: Yeah pizza and a pie and a cider donut Yeah, that'd be trouble.

129
00:08:28,558 --> 00:08:32,730
Scott: but yeah if you are looking at I don't know if that's the ideal apple picking experience for everyone.

130
00:08:32,951 --> 00:08:46,342
Scott: But if you want to go to it like spend all day in an apple orchard just having a good time You know partying you can't grill out there, but you can do pretty much anything else and Such and such and have you know, like a party apple orchard.

131
00:08:46,362 --> 00:08:47,707
Scott: I recommend this one.

132
00:08:47,908 --> 00:08:48,410
Rym: All right.

133
00:08:49,251 --> 00:08:54,730
Rym: So in some news, I don't really want to dwell on the mass shooting because they happen all the time in America.

134
00:08:54,891 --> 00:08:55,838
Scott: What is there new to say?

135
00:08:55,858 --> 00:08:56,664
Scott: I shoot people.

136
00:08:57,652 --> 00:09:05,790
Rym: I think the last new thing to say was after Sandy Hook When we realized that even children being killed in mass was not enough for the government to do anything.

137
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:06,955
Scott: People want to shoot people.

138
00:09:06,975 --> 00:09:09,045
Scott: They don't care if someone else shot someone.

139
00:09:09,085 --> 00:09:09,306
Scott: good.

140
00:09:09,326 --> 00:09:12,581
Scott: Yep They're probably secretly at home being like, oh it's good.

141
00:09:12,621 --> 00:09:13,506
Scott: Someone shot those kids.

142
00:09:13,546 --> 00:09:15,375
Scott: Yeah, because they're evil That's how they are.

143
00:09:15,436 --> 00:09:16,522
Rym: Or it's all a false flag.

144
00:09:16,542 --> 00:09:17,870
Rym: They're they're all crisis actors.

145
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:22,950
Scott: No, I don't think they actually someone actually believes that but I think I have so because of our belief.

146
00:09:23,071 --> 00:09:26,030
Rym: I know a lot about people who may just like it when people get shot.

147
00:09:26,211 --> 00:09:31,369
Scott: I know a lot about people who literally believe they just fantasize about shooting people and if someone else shoots people they like it.

148
00:09:31,932 --> 00:09:40,540
Rym: but yeah that happens and I don't know what you can do other than if you got into the habit of calling your senators and reps because of health care.

149
00:09:41,921 --> 00:09:46,922
Rym: Not a bad time to start doing the same thing over this cuz it's working a little bit, uh-huh Yeah, right.

150
00:09:46,983 --> 00:09:49,452
Rym: No, there's some really you don't read like 538 or anything.

151
00:09:49,492 --> 00:09:51,720
Rym: There's some evidence that it's having an effect?

152
00:09:53,544 --> 00:09:53,705
Scott: Uh-huh.

153
00:09:54,367 --> 00:09:55,691
Scott: I believe when I see it.

154
00:09:55,872 --> 00:09:57,357
Rym: Okay, you're just choosing not to look at it.

155
00:09:57,377 --> 00:09:58,380
Rym: But anyway in other news.

156
00:09:59,701 --> 00:10:13,511
Rym: so hacking has been in the news a lot lately because there's been a bunch of hacks and also a lot of people are stupid and use guessable passwords or use the same password everywhere or Log into their email on a public computer and don't log out or very

157
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:14,976
Scott: large important organizations.

158
00:10:15,057 --> 00:10:18,968
Rym: I really shitty IT Yep, but you can do a good bit wide extent.

159
00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:22,980
Rym: protect yourself from many of those things by having basic security practices.

160
00:10:23,601 --> 00:10:27,755
Scott: But this you could learn if you listen to geek then yeah, which comes down to people.

161
00:10:27,796 --> 00:10:29,020
Scott: only listen to hear GeekNights.

162
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,687
Scott: They don't listen to it.

163
00:10:29,727 --> 00:10:32,526
Rym: So they won't Use unique passwords.

164
00:10:33,129 --> 00:10:34,879
Rym: don't give anyone your password ever.

165
00:10:36,321 --> 00:10:40,070
Rym: That two-factor that alone will cover like 90% of the problems.

166
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,252
Rym: you're likely to run into that.

167
00:10:41,292 --> 00:10:42,395
Scott: me I do it.

168
00:10:43,177 --> 00:10:50,114
Rym: one of the biggest Vulnerabilities today is the fact that most companies want to make money.

169
00:10:50,235 --> 00:10:52,060
Rym: Obviously, they don't care that much about support.

170
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,559
Rym: They don't care that much about really anything.

171
00:10:55,223 --> 00:10:57,499
Rym: Unless those things get in the way of making money.

172
00:10:58,303 --> 00:11:05,739
Rym: So they actually want to care a lot about the support Experience because they want people to be happy and keep giving them money.

173
00:11:06,201 --> 00:11:15,220
Rym: Mm-hmm a big part of that is that they try to reduce barriers to getting support Like if you need help from I don't know your cable company because your cable stopped working.

174
00:11:15,661 --> 00:11:20,139
Rym: They want to make it real easy for you to get that help so that you won't just cancel the service.

175
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:21,541
Scott: But

176
00:11:22,044 --> 00:11:40,160
Rym: to make it easy it turns out that because most people are kind of stupid They don't like to do things like put a password into the website where they have to go complain about their cable service not working or They don't want to have to like prove who they are on the phone before someone resets their password or unlocks their account.

177
00:11:41,102 --> 00:11:47,420
Rym: The end result of this is that most of the vulnerabilities out there that are trivial to exploit do not require much technology knowledge.

178
00:11:48,027 --> 00:11:56,790
Rym: they simply require Trying to open a support ticket of some kind with a company and eventually that company will probably just give you access To someone else's account.

179
00:11:57,655 --> 00:11:58,420
Scott: you didn't read this article.

180
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:58,741
Scott: Did you

181
00:11:59,102 --> 00:12:01,930
Rym: so this article that I'm about to link to

182
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:02,692
Scott: see if you read this

183
00:12:02,932 --> 00:12:26,464
Rym: goes to a much more specific example of using exploits in that kind of technology like for example the way you auto register an account on a domain and how you can get companies to give you credentials to things that you shouldn't have access to through basically purely automated systems that Rely on basic things like oh they have an email address at organization comm.

184
00:12:26,504 --> 00:12:37,576
Rym: that must be good never mind the fact that Certain other magic number organization at organization address calm will actually send a message through somewhere That is publicly accessible.

185
00:12:37,877 --> 00:12:38,078
Scott: right.

186
00:12:38,098 --> 00:12:40,850
Scott: so think about this right, so let's say Craigslist has a slack.

187
00:12:41,119 --> 00:12:46,543
Scott: Yeah well the Craigslist slack will let you have an account if you have an email address at Craigslist.

188
00:12:46,563 --> 00:12:49,909
Scott: because who can get an email address at Craigslist unless you work for Craigslist?

189
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:57,810
Scott: Craigslist has a system of generating anonymous email addresses for people to help them do transactions anonymously.

190
00:12:58,415 --> 00:13:00,110
Scott: Those email addresses are at Craigslist.

191
00:13:00,271 --> 00:13:05,249
Scott: So if you get a email support ticket at like Time Warner who knows where right?

192
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:06,251
Scott: Your name?

193
00:13:06,312 --> 00:13:11,690
Scott: but their support system might generate this email address that autumn forwards to you to help you be anonymous.

194
00:13:12,032 --> 00:13:19,170
Scott: Or you know just for your support ticket it creates a brand new email address That sends emails to you and that email address is at Time Warner.

195
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:25,288
Scott: And now you can use this support ticket email address to log in to like the Time Warner slack is.

196
00:13:25,308 --> 00:13:28,598
Scott: who would have an email Address at Time Warner except time Warner employee?

197
00:13:28,638 --> 00:13:31,086
Scott: well that people with help desk tickets will have.

198
00:13:31,487 --> 00:13:34,466
Rym: and this is you know Social engineering is what we usually talk about.

199
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:37,485
Scott: no this engineering this is an actual vulnerability.

200
00:13:37,505 --> 00:13:37,706
Scott: by by.

201
00:13:39,073 --> 00:13:42,670
Scott: Not any individual product will write would have this problem.

202
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:55,359
Scott: It's a. it's the fact that one organization with one domain you thinking False assumptions about the don't security of the domain set up multiple products that combine together Cause a problem in one of the other.

203
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,946
Rym: the reduction of friction.

204
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:57,730
Rym: people they want.

205
00:13:58,332 --> 00:14:20,010
Rym: Everyone out there wants it to be very easy for you to if you're authorized to use something Click on a thing and it just works, you know single sign on and all these different methods, but the Prove who you are purely by the domain of your email address is shockingly common and this is a very Specific set of detailed examples of how these exploits can be used.

206
00:14:20,136 --> 00:14:26,910
Scott: Yeah You set up one thing and it's based on the assumption that yeah Of course everyone who has at front row crew dot-com email addresses is someone we know and trust.

207
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:31,830
Scott: Yeah, and you set up another thing where I just create automatically crazy email addresses for people.

208
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:37,336
Scott: It's like oh they both make sense on their own and then when they're both installed on the same domain together It's like oopsie.

209
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:39,266
Scott: I didn't realize that wasn't thinking about that.

210
00:14:39,286 --> 00:14:51,570
Rym: Yep, and There's no good way around this because the reality is almost any company That's small ish or even medium-sized and they want to reduce friction for things like making accounts or proving identity.

211
00:14:52,112 --> 00:15:06,289
Rym: This is the kind of shit they're gonna do because the alternative is to set up complicated single sign-on mechanisms that require actual authentication of the person on the other side of the connection and not just some trivially spoof credential that they might have.

212
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:13,126
Rym: and There's not much you can do about it except if you start a small company.

213
00:15:13,507 --> 00:15:14,149
Rym: don't do this.

214
00:15:17,153 --> 00:15:29,385
Rym: But I wanted to give a very specific Example of how these things work because when people usually say hacking as Scott and I often complain about Most hacking comes down to your password was easily guessed and/or is the same across.

215
00:15:29,465 --> 00:15:31,270
Scott: all is an example of a hacking.

216
00:15:31,793 --> 00:15:35,290
Scott: That is you know, it's this is this is real hacking, right?

217
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:37,326
Scott: You want to see a real example of real hacking?

218
00:15:37,366 --> 00:15:37,769
Scott: This is it?

219
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:38,853
Scott: It's now it is.

220
00:15:38,953 --> 00:15:43,150
Scott: it's not someone the Pharisee cracking codes with a black screen with green text.

221
00:15:43,331 --> 00:15:44,608
Scott: It's just something stupid like this.

222
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:50,603
Rym: but at the same time this is Social engineering adjacent because it's only because it has to do with a help desk.

223
00:15:50,643 --> 00:15:52,730
Rym: Not just that it's the same kind of workflow.

224
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:56,429
Rym: So where a lot of this comes from is that a support desk?

225
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:08,319
Rym: will usually especially in a middle-sized company have processes for how credentials get figured out and identity gets proven and a lot of the implementations of this kind of logic.

226
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:18,830
Rym: the prover you are with your email address was in response to Automating those workflows so that no one has to call a person on the phone because the person is easily socially engineered.

227
00:16:19,292 --> 00:16:26,405
Rym: But because the workflows primarily mirror the thing that the person on the phone was doing anyway They're just as vulnerable but in a different way.

228
00:16:26,425 --> 00:16:29,089
Rym: Hmm So yeah, you got some news.

229
00:16:29,632 --> 00:16:34,511
Scott: I don't have any news, but I do have a geek bite of this Apple watch I bought.

230
00:16:35,193 --> 00:16:46,825
Scott: so I bought the new Apple watch because they added the 3g the LTE feature right which suddenly made the Apple watch Sound way good and the pebble watch with iPhone at least was declining in quality.

231
00:16:46,925 --> 00:16:48,490
Rym: Meanwhile pebble on Android is great.

232
00:16:48,651 --> 00:16:51,750
Rym: I don't know what I'll do when this thing breaks because I love the hell out of it.

233
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,838
Rym: But I bought a new one and can't get an Apple watch.

234
00:16:54,319 --> 00:16:56,528
Scott: So the Apple watch let's just go over quickly.

235
00:16:56,568 --> 00:16:58,735
Scott: number one They got some problems.

236
00:16:58,755 --> 00:17:01,444
Scott: they have still have not fixed for the actual LTE.

237
00:17:01,504 --> 00:17:02,949
Scott: the reason I bought it still doesn't work.

238
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:04,694
Scott: Verizon I can't.

239
00:17:04,734 --> 00:17:11,569
Scott: I mean a lot of other people have gotten it to work But I still can't make it work and I contacted Verizon and they said yeah, we know it's a problem.

240
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:15,365
Scott: We have to fix it with Apple and you'll hear from us when it's fixed.

241
00:17:15,707 --> 00:17:16,550
Scott: I tried it yesterday.

242
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:18,542
Scott: It didn't work still and I haven't heard from them.

243
00:17:19,106 --> 00:17:21,502
Scott: So Okay, at least I'm not paying $10 a month.

244
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:24,878
Scott: So, you know, that's okay.

245
00:17:25,181 --> 00:17:26,930
Scott: I'm not paying for the broken part, which is fine.

246
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:32,933
Scott: But yeah, I guess a lot of the things I had to say about Apple watch are things that are probably true of the first Apple watch.

247
00:17:32,953 --> 00:17:36,670
Scott: so I'm like, I'm not sure about the differences between one two and three because I only had three.

248
00:17:36,941 --> 00:17:40,925
Rym: Yep I never had one and two and the only thing I can confirm is what cuz you had the problem.

249
00:17:40,945 --> 00:17:43,025
Rym: is you also because you Have an Apple device.

250
00:17:43,811 --> 00:17:47,883
Rym: Smart watches that aren't an Apple watch are often crippled in many ways.

251
00:17:47,943 --> 00:17:48,144
Scott: Yeah.

252
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:53,040
Scott: So the first thing is that The ability to easily change.

253
00:17:53,301 --> 00:17:56,090
Scott: it's like it's annoying that you have to buy an Apple watch band, right?

254
00:17:56,171 --> 00:17:57,949
Scott: You can't just buy a standard watch band.

255
00:17:58,632 --> 00:18:00,477
Rym: But like even my pebble uses right.

256
00:18:00,517 --> 00:18:05,814
Scott: but standard watch bands actually are slightly annoying to remove and put back on What they have.

257
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:07,870
Scott: that little because you need a little tool.

258
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:10,780
Rym: I need a little bar standard watch bands have.

259
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,409
Rym: I have one extra one sitting on my desk right here.

260
00:18:13,891 --> 00:18:16,382
Rym: Modern watch bands use this little bar.

261
00:18:16,603 --> 00:18:16,744
Rym: Yeah.

262
00:18:16,764 --> 00:18:16,945
Rym: Yep.

263
00:18:16,965 --> 00:18:18,575
Scott: It's a little bar with a little button I need.

264
00:18:18,636 --> 00:18:19,870
Rym: you need to push the button and it comes off.

265
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,841
Scott: You need a tool to get in there and push the belt out.

266
00:18:21,921 --> 00:18:22,645
Rym: Look that sticks out.

267
00:18:22,665 --> 00:18:23,289
Rym: There's a little button.

268
00:18:24,231 --> 00:18:24,553
Scott: I cannot.

269
00:18:24,653 --> 00:18:26,362
Scott: I've always needed a tool to get it in there.

270
00:18:26,383 --> 00:18:27,669
Rym: push the never had one that looked like that.

271
00:18:27,911 --> 00:18:28,554
Scott: Yeah, it's the one.

272
00:18:28,614 --> 00:18:30,502
Scott: it's the kind I have on my time watch.

273
00:18:30,523 --> 00:18:32,812
Scott: I cannot get it out without a tool I could.

274
00:18:32,872 --> 00:18:34,036
Scott: it's so small and pointy.

275
00:18:34,417 --> 00:18:38,170
Rym: Uh, I can look I can just take it off my pebble or look at that.

276
00:18:38,552 --> 00:18:39,175
Scott: Oh, what happened?

277
00:18:39,256 --> 00:18:40,101
Scott: Anyway, how?

278
00:18:40,343 --> 00:18:41,490
Rym: how did you have trouble with this?

279
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,158
Scott: I've never been able to get one out without a tool.

280
00:18:43,198 --> 00:18:44,464
Scott: they even make a tool the out.

281
00:18:44,505 --> 00:18:46,354
Scott: if you go to the watch shop They'll use a tool.

282
00:18:46,374 --> 00:18:48,084
Rym: No, I just did it right here.

283
00:18:48,104 --> 00:18:48,627
Rym: I'll do it again.

284
00:18:48,888 --> 00:18:49,210
Scott: Put it back.

285
00:18:49,411 --> 00:18:50,497
Scott: How did you have trouble with this?

286
00:18:50,517 --> 00:18:52,567
Scott: I could never get one of those on or off without a tool.

287
00:18:52,849 --> 00:18:53,994
Scott: anyway It's back on.

288
00:18:54,456 --> 00:18:55,038
Scott: Oh Jesus.

289
00:18:55,159 --> 00:18:56,022
Scott: Congratulations.

290
00:18:56,103 --> 00:18:56,986
Rym: Oh, look, I'll take the bottom.

291
00:18:57,187 --> 00:18:57,830
Rym: Oh, it's off.

292
00:18:58,171 --> 00:19:03,867
Scott: The point is is that Apple overcharges hella for these proprietary watch bands like 50 bucks each.

293
00:19:03,927 --> 00:19:04,950
Scott: It's bullshit, right?

294
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,540
Scott: If you go nothing wrong, I know exactly how it works.

295
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:12,390
Scott: I cannot physically get in there to push the button cuz it's so tiny.

296
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:15,217
Rym: Okay, that's crazy to me.

297
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:15,840
Scott: Okay.

298
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,390
Scott: I don't have any fingernails either because I bet them all off.

299
00:19:18,972 --> 00:19:21,701
Rym: I'll use my smallest fingernail the one that I busted off.

300
00:19:21,901 --> 00:19:22,985
Rym: Oh, look how it's off.

301
00:19:23,587 --> 00:19:35,369
Scott: Anyway, okay The point is if you go ahead and you go on Amazon you can actually buy Apple watch bands made by other people that aren't Apple for like almost nothing.

302
00:19:35,389 --> 00:19:38,175
Scott: and Actually, it's kind of nice.

303
00:19:38,255 --> 00:19:39,820
Scott: just be changing watch bands like we.

304
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:41,084
Rym: you mean like I've done.

305
00:19:41,425 --> 00:19:46,043
Scott: for as long as I've worn watches I've never been able to easily change a watch band.

306
00:19:46,063 --> 00:19:47,570
Rym: There's no tool that's needed for this.

307
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:48,875
Scott: I've always needed a tool.

308
00:19:49,076 --> 00:19:49,277
Rym: Are you?

309
00:19:49,398 --> 00:19:51,688
Rym: I don't think you had the same kind of bar with the button.

310
00:19:51,889 --> 00:19:52,150
Scott: It is.

311
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,153
Scott: It's the same exact kind.

312
00:19:53,695 --> 00:19:55,020
Scott: I I guarantee it.

313
00:19:55,241 --> 00:19:56,947
Rym: this fascinates me Scott.

314
00:19:57,047 --> 00:19:57,468
Rym: Okay, no end.

315
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,035
Scott: The point is you like.

316
00:20:00,216 --> 00:20:03,510
Scott: it's easier to change the app even even if I had a fingernail.

317
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:05,179
Rym: This be like imagine we had a mutual.

318
00:20:05,219 --> 00:20:07,130
Scott: we get off of this and talk more about Apple watch.

319
00:20:08,771 --> 00:20:16,356
Rym: Imagine if we had a mutual friend like scojo or something and we just learned like he can't take seatbelts off without help Like you just can't do it without a tool.

320
00:20:16,457 --> 00:20:17,381
Rym: There's a little bit.

321
00:20:17,401 --> 00:20:22,017
Scott: if a seatbelt was microscopic Just pop it off and on.

322
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:24,470
Rym: I literally changed my watch band every time I go running.

323
00:20:24,811 --> 00:20:29,250
Scott: Anyway, I am most people did not change the watch band so easily.

324
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:34,790
Rym: I'm confident that anyone I hand this watch to without prompting can change the watch band in less than 10.

325
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:37,384
Scott: Anyway, let's talk about the other parts of the Apple watch.

326
00:20:37,424 --> 00:20:40,689
Rym: besides changing watch band I feel like this is the most important part for you.

327
00:20:40,952 --> 00:20:48,231
Scott: So it has a heart rate monitor That I'm not sure how good it is because I know nothing about heart rates or if my heart what a heart rate should Be.

328
00:20:48,612 --> 00:20:52,104
Rym: so the new pebble and I didn't get was supposed to have that and it doesn't so.

329
00:20:52,244 --> 00:20:57,065
Scott: and it works by basically shining a green Light into your arm and detecting how much light is reflected.

330
00:20:57,085 --> 00:20:59,674
Scott: black because blood Absorbs green light.

331
00:20:59,894 --> 00:21:00,336
Rym: what's what?

332
00:21:00,396 --> 00:21:04,150
Rym: the useful thing about them is don't worry about the instantaneous rate because they're not that accurate.

333
00:21:04,371 --> 00:21:09,745
Rym: Obviously you opt for trending especially feel if you have like Strava Pro Gives you what does it give you?

334
00:21:09,785 --> 00:21:10,270
Scott: it gives you what?

335
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,135
Scott: Walking average resting rate.

336
00:21:13,456 --> 00:21:14,259
Rym: Yeah, I don't know.

337
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:18,531
Rym: So if those trend upward over a long period of time go to a doctor I don't know I don't.

338
00:21:18,591 --> 00:21:23,409
Rym: if they turn down over a long period of time like a way long period of time also go to a doctor.

339
00:21:23,529 --> 00:21:26,461
Scott: the Battery people are acting like the battery lasts like one day.

340
00:21:26,481 --> 00:21:28,530
Scott: I had the battery last like today.

341
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,196
Rym: That's probably cuz your LTE isn't working.

342
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:31,500
Scott: It's probably a thing.

343
00:21:31,761 --> 00:21:34,250
Scott: But also here's the thing that's it is bad.

344
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:38,321
Scott: So I was have the Strava app which works.

345
00:21:38,361 --> 00:21:39,727
Scott: I push play on the watch it starts.

346
00:21:39,747 --> 00:21:40,470
Scott: recording is great.

347
00:21:40,631 --> 00:21:47,978
Scott: Yep, it seems like when I do that and I push start on my watch It doesn't just tell my phone to start Strava ing.

348
00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:52,150
Scott: it actually just the watch does the Strava ing and kills the fucking battery.

349
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:56,824
Rym: well Cuz the idea is that people who do that want to just cape the watch and know which.

350
00:21:57,005 --> 00:21:57,868
Scott: that would be fine.

351
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:01,359
Scott: if I Was out there with watch only.

352
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,550
Scott: I would hope that it would say oh my phone isn't nearby.

353
00:22:03,751 --> 00:22:06,809
Scott: I guess I'll have to do the Strava myself with my own GPS and my own LTE.

354
00:22:07,412 --> 00:22:11,070
Scott: But if the phone is nearby, it should say oh the phone is here.

355
00:22:11,211 --> 00:22:14,070
Scott: Let me just tell the watch to do the Strava and save my fucking battery.

356
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:15,477
Scott: That's what my watch does.

357
00:22:15,497 --> 00:22:16,923
Scott: that is not what the Apple watch does.

358
00:22:16,964 --> 00:22:20,209
Scott: if you push play on the watch It uses the watch and kills the battery.

359
00:22:20,731 --> 00:22:25,665
Scott: So I'm only can push play on the watch in instances where I don't have the phone with me.

360
00:22:25,685 --> 00:22:27,230
Scott: Yeah, that's annoying.

361
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:31,402
Scott: One good thing is the pebble even on iPhone.

362
00:22:31,442 --> 00:22:33,550
Scott: Let me control music just fine, right?

363
00:22:34,273 --> 00:22:35,860
Scott: And the same thing with Apple watch.

364
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,410
Scott: it lets me control the music on the phone just fine, right?

365
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,670
Scott: It can also play its own music, which I haven't done ever.

366
00:22:41,192 --> 00:22:42,036
Scott: I don't know why you'd want to.

367
00:22:42,418 --> 00:22:43,725
Scott: I guess you've got the wireless headphone.

368
00:22:43,745 --> 00:22:44,709
Scott: you would but I don't have those.

369
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:48,258
Scott: But there are additional features.

370
00:22:48,338 --> 00:22:52,009
Scott: right the the pebble can only do forward back play pause stop.

371
00:22:52,411 --> 00:23:06,403
Scott: Yeah, the Apple watch when I'm listening to a podcast can do go forward 15 second back for back Right, which is I've used that a ton like Oh podcast advertisement starting 15 second Right without having to get my phone out and then push the button.

372
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:07,889
Scott: So that's really nice.

373
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:13,942
Scott: There's I remember the milk app that doesn't really work so well, uh-huh.

374
00:23:14,584 --> 00:23:16,730
Scott: It doesn't synchronize but that's remember the milk's fault.

375
00:23:18,092 --> 00:23:19,136
Scott: One thing that's crazy.

376
00:23:19,176 --> 00:23:19,497
Scott: Good.

377
00:23:19,959 --> 00:23:22,390
Scott: Is that the Apple pay is on the watch?

378
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:26,370
Scott: Yeah, I went to Dwayne Reed and I just sort of waved my arm and then they gave me stuff.

379
00:23:26,611 --> 00:23:29,610
Rym: Well same thing with the all the passes like when we went the Rangers game.

380
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:31,900
Rym: Emily's had it on her watch and just boop and got in.

381
00:23:32,281 --> 00:23:34,370
Scott: all the Apple passbook stuff is on the watch.

382
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:36,181
Scott: So he's like, okay, just walking fast to our garden.

383
00:23:36,201 --> 00:23:36,925
Scott: Like look at my watch.

384
00:23:36,965 --> 00:23:37,368
Scott: Let me in.

385
00:23:37,408 --> 00:23:39,838
Scott: Okay That's like pebble watch.

386
00:23:39,858 --> 00:23:40,763
Scott: Definitely can't do that.

387
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:41,709
Scott: Not even close.

388
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:43,993
Scott: But yeah, it does.

389
00:23:44,033 --> 00:23:48,085
Scott: a bunch of you know at the expense of some battery life and some money.

390
00:23:48,105 --> 00:23:52,482
Scott: if you have an iPhone It does a lot fancier better stuff.

391
00:23:52,522 --> 00:23:53,950
Scott: Not everything works perfectly.

392
00:23:54,851 --> 00:24:00,547
Scott: Some of the things are not, you know the greatest but overall it's better than pebble.

393
00:24:00,608 --> 00:24:03,155
Scott: if you have iPhone It just costs a lot of money.

394
00:24:03,556 --> 00:24:08,270
Scott: So if you want those betterness things then and you have money then do it.

395
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:10,529
Scott: I assume the LTE will be fine once it fucking works.

396
00:24:10,777 --> 00:24:19,360
Rym: Yeah But it doesn't right now because the rally is that having a smartwatch if you go like if you do stuff is a Really useful addition to your life.

397
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:29,281
Rym: notifications are way more reliable And also which again is only a problem for you with a pebble in the iPhone because they're Lockstep on the pebble with and they're just more reliable.

398
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,586
Scott: I always see them every time.

399
00:24:30,847 --> 00:24:39,290
Scott: but also Better than pebble you can reply to them Most of them anyway, and you can reply to them in very very useful ways, right?

400
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:49,399
Scott: So if I reply to a text I can like draw on the screen to write words and then push send No way pebble doesn't even have a touchscreen right.

401
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,505
Scott: I can talk which I think pebble can do.

402
00:24:51,846 --> 00:24:56,549
Scott: you can talk at the watch And then it'll turn into text and reply which I can do.

403
00:24:56,569 --> 00:25:00,872
Scott: that But do like any notification like a tweet or a hangout or yeah That's something

404
00:25:00,912 --> 00:25:11,444
Rym: I really want to have because with Google Glass it did that really well And that was one feature of Google Glass I used quite a bit was Responding to things and just talking and it would type the message and I could just send it

405
00:25:12,026 --> 00:25:15,200
Scott: and the custom watch faces And you know I can start.

406
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,210
Scott: you know I usually like if I go do laundry.

407
00:25:17,331 --> 00:25:22,141
Scott: I got to bring my phone to just set a timer so that when I know when the laundry is done I'll just do that on the watch.

408
00:25:22,202 --> 00:25:23,130
Scott: now watch has timer.

409
00:25:23,492 --> 00:25:25,683
Rym: Oh, you mean like my watch does the pebble watch?

410
00:25:25,703 --> 00:25:27,150
Scott: you had to get like an app to be a timer.

411
00:25:27,411 --> 00:25:28,617
Rym: There was always a built-in timer.

412
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:29,883
Scott: I never used it.

413
00:25:30,003 --> 00:25:31,129
Scott: I guess it worked great.

414
00:25:31,209 --> 00:25:36,113
Scott: actually Didn't integrate with my phone, so I think if I set the timer I don't know.

415
00:25:36,153 --> 00:25:36,435
Scott: I don't know.

416
00:25:36,616 --> 00:25:38,003
Rym: I said a button BAM got a timer.

417
00:25:38,184 --> 00:25:39,290
Scott: I haven't actually tested it.

418
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:41,261
Scott: I wonder if I set the timer on the Apple watch.

419
00:25:41,301 --> 00:25:42,890
Scott: will the phone ring when it's done?

420
00:25:43,251 --> 00:25:44,174
Rym: I don't think so.

421
00:25:44,255 --> 00:25:44,616
Scott: I don't know.

422
00:25:44,997 --> 00:25:48,510
Scott: I haven't tried it yet, but there is a. there's a nicer timer than pebble watch.

423
00:25:48,631 --> 00:26:00,783
Rym: Yep, but I feel like if you want a smartwatch also It does Siri shit, but I don't use Siri regardless if if you get an iWatch or a non iWatch I feel like if you if you feel like you want a smartwatch at all.

424
00:26:00,864 --> 00:26:07,445
Scott: pretty much now's the time to buy because I don't Think I don't know anything that they seem to have plateaued in their power batteries.

425
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:16,062
Rym: Processing power and material science together will limit any Significant advancement in the usability of smartwatches for years to come.

426
00:26:16,122 --> 00:26:18,310
Scott: Do not buy official watch bands from Apple.

427
00:26:18,371 --> 00:26:19,179
Scott: They make you buy one.

428
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,170
Scott: you can't get all Apple watch.

429
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:22,984
Rym: I thought they were supposed to have like logic or something in them, but they don't know.

430
00:26:23,045 --> 00:26:24,070
Scott: it's just a just a band.

431
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:26,470
Scott: It has little plastic clips at the end of the slide into the watch.

432
00:26:26,678 --> 00:26:29,490
Scott: Yeah I thought they had logic in them which is why they were 50 bucks plus.

433
00:26:29,594 --> 00:26:33,123
Scott: But no So you have to get one because your Apple watch must come with one.

434
00:26:33,144 --> 00:26:37,820
Scott: so pick the Apple watch that comes with the one You like and then buy a whole bunch of them on Amazon.

435
00:26:37,841 --> 00:26:39,687
Scott: Yeah, also I got the.

436
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:40,670
Scott: I've had a tiny wrist.

437
00:26:41,152 --> 00:26:42,698
Scott: I got these smaller Apple watch.

438
00:26:42,738 --> 00:26:45,690
Scott: I didn't get the bigger one and these watch bands fit way better.

439
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:50,329
Scott: I'm actually using the third smallest hole and not and not the smallest hole.

440
00:26:51,491 --> 00:26:52,134
Rym: Yeah, I got.

441
00:26:52,154 --> 00:26:53,619
Rym: I use like some Barton.

442
00:26:53,639 --> 00:26:54,884
Rym: I think Burton Barton.

443
00:26:54,964 --> 00:26:55,345
Rym: That's right.

444
00:26:55,446 --> 00:26:56,610
Rym: I buy because I buy this man.

445
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,336
Scott: I just went on Amazon and got whatever.

446
00:26:58,497 --> 00:26:59,801
Rym: I'm in the third smallest hole here.

447
00:26:59,821 --> 00:27:03,096
Rym: when usually I'm always on an extra smallest hole That I've cut myself.

448
00:27:03,398 --> 00:27:04,445
Rym: Yeah, so that's progress.

449
00:27:04,727 --> 00:27:07,659
Rym: Mm-hmm What are our wrists just getting smaller?

450
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,610
Rym: or are we finally being accommodated as a demographic with tiny wrists?

451
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:12,369
Scott: I just bought the smaller watch the.

452
00:27:18,917 --> 00:27:21,684
Rym: but anyway Things of the day.

453
00:27:21,704 --> 00:27:22,249
Rym: what do you got?

454
00:27:22,951 --> 00:27:25,137
Scott: So there's a. there's in New York City.

455
00:27:25,237 --> 00:27:30,952
Scott: if you're in Queens at least Western Queens and you want to go to Brooklyn These.

456
00:27:30,972 --> 00:27:35,690
Scott: you got to take a bridge because there's some water and there's also a highway and there aren't that many bridges.

457
00:27:35,891 --> 00:27:37,537
Scott: Actually trains the stuff in the way.

458
00:27:37,577 --> 00:27:39,865
Scott: you can't get there without a bridge in Western Queens.

459
00:27:39,885 --> 00:27:43,918
Scott: There's some poisonous water Western Brooklyn and you want to get to.

460
00:27:43,978 --> 00:27:45,807
Scott: nor, you know go north in the clouds.

461
00:27:45,827 --> 00:27:46,390
Scott: There's two bridges.

462
00:27:46,551 --> 00:27:51,550
Scott: There's the bridge we use 90% of the time which is the Pulaski bridge because it's the one that's closest to the water.

463
00:27:51,671 --> 00:27:52,797
Scott: They finally have an awesome.

464
00:27:52,938 --> 00:27:59,294
Scott: It had a shitty bike path that was mixed with pedestrians But now they take away the lane away from the cars and there's an awesome bike But it's so great.

465
00:27:59,334 --> 00:28:00,980
Scott: You can just fly over on your bike.

466
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,587
Scott: We it's the greatest right?

467
00:28:02,627 --> 00:28:04,555
Scott: It's also the closest We can walk there from here.

468
00:28:04,575 --> 00:28:05,118
Scott: It's so close.

469
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:08,734
Rym: Yep, and it's probably the most used by non carp It's right near Hebrew.

470
00:28:08,775 --> 00:28:11,810
Rym: No, you won't go there, but I think we're gonna cook tonight.

471
00:28:11,871 --> 00:28:13,588
Scott: But I also have left over blue apron.

472
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:20,950
Rym: But the problem with the Pulaski is that if you're driving it connects busy non freeway roads together.

473
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:22,470
Rym: It's like normal roads connected.

474
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:27,726
Scott: Anyway, there's another bridge over to the to the east a little bit called the cuz you go cuz you go.

475
00:28:27,746 --> 00:28:30,499
Scott: let's go something something I can't pronounce.

476
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:32,109
Scott: I'm sorry bridge cuz co.

477
00:28:32,813 --> 00:28:43,810
Scott: Anyway, Polish, I assume they what they did with this bridge is They replaced some of it with an awesome bridge of modernness that has that new design where there's like a triangle of cables.

478
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,135
Scott: You know the design I'm talking about.

479
00:28:45,155 --> 00:28:45,316
Scott: Yep.

480
00:28:45,637 --> 00:28:47,043
Rym: You see those bridges all over the world.

481
00:28:47,083 --> 00:28:48,750
Scott: It's like the new bridge style.

482
00:28:48,831 --> 00:28:50,949
Scott: It's like they'll trend in bridge design these days, right?

483
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:51,933
Scott: You don't have a step.

484
00:28:51,973 --> 00:28:52,374
Scott: one comes.

485
00:28:52,394 --> 00:28:56,608
Scott: distance is basically one tower with a bunch of cables instead of two towers, right?

486
00:28:57,049 --> 00:29:04,235
Scott: Anyway And then they have gonna get rid of the old one and then replace the old one with a new one and now have double Bridge.

487
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:05,390
Rym: because that's the trouble with New York.

488
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:14,306
Rym: You can't just tear down a bridge and then build a new one because millions of people use that bridge every and they're even gonna have You know bike and pedestrian on there - yeah once that the other one's done.

489
00:29:14,406 --> 00:29:15,350
Scott: So which is gonna be great.

490
00:29:15,611 --> 00:29:20,030
Rym: I biked over there a bunch to watch the construction because there were some big crazy crane things going on over time.

491
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,870
Scott: People have been driving on the new one for a while.

492
00:29:21,992 --> 00:29:29,837
Scott: Oh, yeah for a long time We're gonna blow up the old one and then there's like well actually we're not gonna blow up the old one We're just gonna take it apart carefully.

493
00:29:29,857 --> 00:29:33,167
Scott: It's like I. they get ten minute hauling and delaying and whatever.

494
00:29:33,588 --> 00:29:41,545
Scott: finally yesterday at 8 in the morning, New York time they Energetically felled the old one meaning they blew it up.

495
00:29:41,686 --> 00:29:47,610
Scott: meaning they blew it up Basically, they blew it up in such a way that it would sort of fall apart and then just fall straight down.

496
00:29:48,034 --> 00:29:48,864
Scott: They did a good job.

497
00:29:48,924 --> 00:29:49,349
Scott: It worked.

498
00:29:50,574 --> 00:29:54,587
Scott: I was in bed at 8 a.m But I knew that it was gonna happen at 8 a.m.

499
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:58,765
Rym: Yep, I thought I'd go watch it and then I didn't because I know I'm getting.

500
00:29:58,905 --> 00:30:07,510
Scott: I'm going over there at 8 a.m on Sunday, but I did Listen, and I didn't even open my window because my window is actually really good at blocking sound.

501
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:11,686
Scott: No, but I'm like if it's really loud, I'll be able to hear it through the window at 8 a.m.

502
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:17,908
Scott: I definitely heard like some sort of exploding noise in the distance, even though my windows are closed.

503
00:30:17,948 --> 00:30:20,680
Rym: comment here I felt my apartment shake a mile away in Sunnyside.

504
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,725
Rym: They don't mess around.

505
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:22,086
Scott: Nope.

506
00:30:22,307 --> 00:30:24,880
Rym: second comment This is a shitty old bridge everyone hated.

507
00:30:24,941 --> 00:30:26,087
Rym: We're happy to see a cow.

508
00:30:26,248 --> 00:30:26,690
Rym: That's true.

509
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:32,010
Rym: Also that bridge if you like go look at that bridge because you can see it in the video.

510
00:30:32,373 --> 00:30:34,270
Scott: You can see the old one next to the new one.

511
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:36,060
Scott: Also, this video starts out muted.

512
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,649
Scott: make sure you unmute it before you play it.

513
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:40,567
Rym: Yeah, because it's it's it's worth it, especially cuz we watch the video.

514
00:30:40,587 --> 00:30:43,276
Scott: You'll see There's many videos of this.

515
00:30:43,356 --> 00:30:45,043
Scott: DJ hammers even made a video of it.

516
00:30:45,083 --> 00:30:49,457
Scott: But this is the best video of this Energetic felling that I have seen.

517
00:30:49,557 --> 00:30:54,316
Rym: but if you think the kuzco bridge looks shitty from a distance I've run under that thing a lot.

518
00:30:55,118 --> 00:30:56,944
Rym: It looks like it's a deathtrap.

519
00:30:56,984 --> 00:30:58,950
Rym: Like it looks almost as bad as the frogs now.

520
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:01,890
Scott: Yeah, people talk about infrastructure right and how we don't maintain it.

521
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:04,439
Scott: Well, look, we did it at least in this one tiny spot.

522
00:31:04,841 --> 00:31:07,310
Rym: Hurray and it took a long time to get to this point.

523
00:31:07,431 --> 00:31:08,998
Scott: Yeah, we this is how hard.

524
00:31:09,019 --> 00:31:11,210
Scott: we shouldn't be this hard, but we at least we did something.

525
00:31:11,591 --> 00:31:20,470
Rym: So Scott if you take a polarizer a linear polarizing filter like in sunglasses Mm-hmm, and you hold it up it blocks what percentage of the light?

526
00:31:22,831 --> 00:31:25,969
Scott: Depends on isn't it like dependent rotation and where the lights coming from?

527
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:28,722
Scott: All right, like if there's glare coming off a window onto your.

528
00:31:29,004 --> 00:31:30,330
Rym: it depends on the phase of the light.

529
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,333
Rym: So let's put it another way.

530
00:31:31,794 --> 00:31:39,336
Rym: if you have one that's oriented say vertically and you put another one that's oriented 90 degrees So it's perpendicular to that one.

531
00:31:39,376 --> 00:31:39,918
Rym: What happens?

532
00:31:40,099 --> 00:31:41,022
Scott: you get zero light.

533
00:31:41,283 --> 00:31:49,509
Rym: That's why if you put on good sunglasses You probably can't read your cell phone screen if you hold it sideways because LCDs are polarized often.

534
00:31:50,133 --> 00:31:55,461
Scott: Oh, well, I think I don't have that problem with my phone But I do have the problem with my monitors.

535
00:31:55,602 --> 00:31:59,404
Scott: if I look at my monitors with sunglasses I can't see anything with my with my cell phone.

536
00:31:59,424 --> 00:32:01,714
Rym: if I turn it 90 degrees I literally cannot see anything.

537
00:32:01,754 --> 00:32:06,590
Rym: because all of my glasses I have them with a vertical polarization, but I digress.

538
00:32:07,571 --> 00:32:12,207
Rym: What happens if you put a third filter in between the two at a 45 degree angle?

539
00:32:14,271 --> 00:32:20,283
Scott: Mmm, it's probably gonna let some light through because the some light gets to the first one and the second one probably messes with the light.

540
00:32:20,591 --> 00:32:30,048
Scott: So the second one messes with it in such a way that some of it will not be at the wrong angle Anymore that the first one put it in so it'll get through the third one.

541
00:32:30,912 --> 00:32:32,177
Rym: But you realize how crazy that sounds.

542
00:32:32,197 --> 00:32:37,577
Rym: you have a thing that you put up and if you put another one in 90 degree angles It blocks 100% of the light.

543
00:32:38,099 --> 00:32:45,350
Rym: but then if you put another filter and the filter cannot add light It can only block light in between those two light gets through again.

544
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,935
Scott: Okay, imagine like a hockey puck.

545
00:32:46,995 --> 00:32:49,202
Scott: right and the hockey puck is horizontal, right?

546
00:32:49,543 --> 00:32:53,194
Scott: Okay, so we set up, you know a slit That's a horizontal slit.

547
00:32:53,275 --> 00:32:54,961
Rym: So let's horizontal hockey pucks through.

548
00:32:55,081 --> 00:32:56,145
Scott: it gets horizontal hockey bucks.

549
00:32:56,305 --> 00:32:57,670
Rym: All vertical ones get blocked, right?

550
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:58,192
Scott: So the sort of.

551
00:32:58,392 --> 00:33:04,610
Scott: after that the horizontal one goes through and then we have another one that blocks horizontal ones Let's vertical ones and now nothing gets through.

552
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:08,747
Scott: Yeah, but now imagine if the middle one sort of sends some of the hockey puck.

553
00:33:08,767 --> 00:33:12,670
Scott: No, that's No, some of them will end up vertical.

554
00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:14,597
Rym: No the analogy there would be.

555
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:20,078
Rym: in the middle of those two you put one that has a. It's the shape of a hockey puck and an angle.

556
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,025
Rym: only angle pucks can get through it.

557
00:33:22,105 --> 00:33:23,935
Scott: No, it knocks him around It's not.

558
00:33:23,995 --> 00:33:25,249
Rym: what do you mean knocks him around?

559
00:33:26,071 --> 00:33:26,928
Rym: Yeah, no.

560
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:36,775
Rym: so This video because this is something that I've in theory I've known since I took high school physics But I never really.

561
00:33:36,896 --> 00:33:38,321
Scott: also light is not.

562
00:33:38,421 --> 00:33:40,810
Scott: light isn't a wave and a particle so it's all fucked up.

563
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:50,678
Rym: Oh, yeah, but I'm just gonna say when I was a kid and I was in AP physics class We had a similar problem and the teacher was like So why is light this way?

564
00:33:50,938 --> 00:33:54,030
Rym: and I was like because it's both a wave and a particle as light is fucked up.

565
00:33:54,131 --> 00:33:54,595
Rym: And you know what?

566
00:33:54,636 --> 00:33:56,050
Rym: He said he said yes, that's true.

567
00:33:56,130 --> 00:34:02,605
Scott: And also that's a stupid answer because that doesn't tell me shit It tells you the light is fucked the fuck up and never does the things that physical things do.

568
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:17,723
Rym: this video for the first time expresses in sufficient detail while simultaneously avoiding going too deep Why this happens and why it's crazy.

569
00:34:17,884 --> 00:34:18,585
Scott: I have to watch it.

570
00:34:18,626 --> 00:34:19,610
Rym: This video is really good.

571
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:21,496
Scott: It's minute learn more about particles.

572
00:34:21,596 --> 00:34:24,887
Rym: And yeah, but but it taught it also gets into like.

573
00:34:24,927 --> 00:34:25,650
Rym: it shows you like.

574
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:26,577
Rym: hey This is what happens.

575
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:28,150
Rym: So here's something for you Scott.

576
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:32,670
Rym: What happens if you put like ten filters in between the first one in the last one?

577
00:34:32,971 --> 00:34:37,545
Rym: Depends which ones and well, they're angled and how pretty much all the fucking light will get through now.

578
00:34:37,565 --> 00:34:38,208
Rym: What?

579
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:45,809
Rym: Yeah And they point out how fucking impossible that is and how basically how does it get?

580
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:51,728
Scott: Okay So what if I took a vertical one and then a horizontal ones and I know light gets no light gets through.

581
00:34:51,848 --> 00:34:56,268
Scott: then I add Filters after can suddenly light reappear.

582
00:34:57,491 --> 00:34:58,354
Rym: Watch this video.

583
00:34:58,515 --> 00:34:58,916
Rym: Mm-hmm.

584
00:34:59,077 --> 00:35:00,944
Rym: The video is like 17 minutes long.

585
00:35:00,984 --> 00:35:01,888
Rym: This is not trivial.

586
00:35:01,928 --> 00:35:08,109
Scott: to explain That'd be like, ah, I can't get through this wall But if you add more walls behind this wall now I can walk through them up.

587
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:23,992
Rym: the the root of it is is Bell's theorem and it gets into something fascinating where the numbers don't even add up the way you'd expect them to and the conclusion one can make is that there could not be a Variable.

588
00:35:24,073 --> 00:35:25,037
Rym: we don't know about.

589
00:35:25,077 --> 00:35:28,010
Rym: that determines whether or not the filter will block a light particle.

590
00:35:28,872 --> 00:35:30,958
Rym: It cannot there cannot be an answer.

591
00:35:31,319 --> 00:35:38,329
Rym: it must be probabilistic and it does a really good job of explaining Why and also why that question even matters?

592
00:35:39,391 --> 00:35:43,229
Rym: Like of all the minute physics videos because they I love these videos like this is a great channel.

593
00:35:44,033 --> 00:35:52,017
Scott: But a minute physics, I thought you said metaphysics But this one I don't know.

594
00:35:52,057 --> 00:35:52,819
Rym: this one really.

595
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:56,890
Rym: it helped me with something that's bothered me for most of my adult life.

596
00:35:58,472 --> 00:36:00,727
Scott: Most of his adult life he's laying in bed before bed each night.

597
00:36:00,768 --> 00:36:03,229
Rym: It's like Polarization, you know what?

598
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:09,922
Rym: so here's what would happen every time I was wearing my Sunglasses out somewhere and I picked up my phone to take a picture and I remembered.

599
00:36:09,962 --> 00:36:11,989
Rym: Oh, I can't see and I did some of this.

600
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:15,425
Rym: Then I would think about this and it would bother me again.

601
00:36:15,445 --> 00:36:18,688
Rym: Uh-huh So yeah, this is a really good video.

602
00:36:19,972 --> 00:36:25,015
Rym: In the meta moment the book club book is not the first not the second not the sixth But the fifth season.

603
00:36:25,035 --> 00:36:28,104
Rym: I'm gonna finish it hopefully before the next Thursday show.

604
00:36:28,124 --> 00:36:29,890
Rym: How much did you read first chapter?

605
00:36:30,231 --> 00:36:31,256
Scott: Great, it's not that long.

606
00:36:31,276 --> 00:36:32,060
Scott: I finished the whole thing.

607
00:36:32,221 --> 00:36:34,516
Scott: I'll probably read it a long while ago I got some flight.

608
00:36:34,597 --> 00:36:44,690
Scott: I started reading the second one but I held off because I play Metroid video games and also because I don't want to Accidentally mess up my brain because it picks up exactly where the first one ends.

609
00:36:45,012 --> 00:36:47,130
Scott: So I don't want to mess up my brain and mess up the pot.

610
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:54,581
Rym: We made that mistake with wheel of time because I we both way over in that first book And that colored my perceptions for good or ill.

611
00:36:54,722 --> 00:36:59,637
Rym: yep, but yeah, I got a bunch of flights coming up this coming weekend So I will probably have it done by Thursday.

612
00:36:59,918 --> 00:37:01,523
Rym: Hmm next Thursday, not this Thursday.

613
00:37:02,205 --> 00:37:03,208
Scott: other things actually.

614
00:37:03,248 --> 00:37:07,243
Scott: this weekend None of us will be there or have anything to remotely to do with it.

615
00:37:07,323 --> 00:37:09,110
Scott: But the New York Comic Con is this weekend?

616
00:37:10,053 --> 00:37:19,550
Rym: Yep, I actually met a lot of people who are desperate to get tickets and they're all just buying them from bootleggers Apparently new comic-con or scalpers really newer comic-con is even worse than ever before.

617
00:37:19,851 --> 00:37:21,957
Scott: They're having pre-event lotteries.

618
00:37:22,037 --> 00:37:30,942
Scott: you go online and there's a digital lottery that chooses whether you're gonna get like some exclusive You know swag or go to a panel or something based on these lotteries.

619
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:33,047
Scott: that happened before the convention even starts.

620
00:37:33,569 --> 00:37:39,990
Scott: I guess Lottery like that because you have to buy tickets from you know, their special, you know, make an account thing.

621
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:42,748
Scott: So now they're using those accounts to do these other sorts of lottery.

622
00:37:42,849 --> 00:37:50,735
Rym: if Pax's still had the problem where every panel had people waiting three hours plus to get into it and they all filled all the time That would always make sense.

623
00:37:50,755 --> 00:37:52,041
Rym: Just do a lottery right there.

624
00:37:52,322 --> 00:37:54,230
Rym: So no one has to wait for three hours.

625
00:37:55,311 --> 00:37:56,013
Scott: I'm not into it.

626
00:37:56,134 --> 00:37:56,676
Rym: What are you gonna do?

627
00:37:56,716 --> 00:37:57,579
Rym: What's what's the alternative?

628
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:58,342
Scott: wait for three hours?

629
00:37:58,683 --> 00:37:59,486
Rym: Why why?

630
00:37:59,546 --> 00:38:00,630
Rym: why is that a good answer?

631
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:02,253
Scott: What's wrong with it?

632
00:38:02,273 --> 00:38:03,338
Rym: So three hours for the panel.

633
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:04,603
Rym: have everyone show up who wants to go.

634
00:38:04,623 --> 00:38:06,229
Rym: just do a lottery right there.

635
00:38:06,551 --> 00:38:12,432
Scott: Be like you for me the person who shows up and waits the longest the person who wants to see it the most badly All right.

636
00:38:12,452 --> 00:38:13,517
Rym: Well, so what about?

637
00:38:13,537 --> 00:38:16,590
Scott: there's no one for being dumb and waiting wanting to go to that panel so bad.

638
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:19,770
Rym: What about the situation where there isn't a place to put a line for that long?

639
00:38:20,011 --> 00:38:26,390
Rym: What about the situation when there are three one-hour panels each of which has a three hour line?

640
00:38:27,311 --> 00:38:28,829
Rym: waiting for it in the same place?

641
00:38:29,951 --> 00:38:34,207
Rym: The moral is don't wait in line for stuff at conventions and don't collect stupid swag.

642
00:38:34,789 --> 00:38:45,110
Rym: Oh, yeah well, the real moral is the New York Comic Con is a soul-sucking nightmare that I Despite having free tickets to for years after I stopped going until eventually they stopped offering me the free tickets.

643
00:38:45,932 --> 00:38:49,794
Rym: I didn't even though I could just take the subway right there Literally had no inclination.

644
00:38:49,814 --> 00:38:52,303
Scott: The next invention we are going to is the week before Thanksgiving.

645
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:56,017
Scott: It is PAX Unplugged unplugged We will be is gonna be so lit.

646
00:38:56,218 --> 00:38:57,162
Rym: Yeah, it weird.

647
00:38:57,242 --> 00:38:58,447
Rym: There's this is all.

648
00:38:58,467 --> 00:38:59,090
Rym: this is our fuck.

649
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:04,699
Scott: The only thing bad about it is is in stupid, Pennsylvania, but that's a Cancelled out by the fact that is easy to get to.

650
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:09,678
Rym: it's cancelled out by the fact that it's way Cheaper and easier to take a train to than Boston.

651
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:17,320
Rym: the hotel cost like a third of what the hotel in Boston would cost And it won't be freezing cold yet like Boston is.

652
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:19,147
Rym: and we'll see if it has bag checks.

653
00:39:19,207 --> 00:39:20,271
Rym: actually don't know I don't know.

654
00:39:20,331 --> 00:39:23,662
Scott: But anyway, I don't imagine they'll be big enough for bag checks.

655
00:39:23,682 --> 00:39:23,983
Scott: We'll see.

656
00:39:24,244 --> 00:39:28,040
Rym: Yeah, but it's gonna be Lid for a lot of reasons.

657
00:39:28,061 --> 00:39:35,240
Scott: We'll talk about it a lot more as it gets close The exact same weekend as PAX Unplugged is a convention We would be doing if it wasn't PAX Unplugged.

658
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:37,710
Scott: and that's anime NYC the first ever anime NYC.

659
00:39:38,514 --> 00:39:41,550
Scott: It looks like we know people who are gonna be there and are working on it.

660
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:53,292
Scott: so if any anime con you are an anime person and not a Gaming con person and you really want to see an amaze and not tabletop games go to anime NYC.

661
00:39:53,693 --> 00:39:54,255
Rym: it I like.

662
00:39:54,376 --> 00:39:57,286
Rym: it is a who's who of people who know what like.

663
00:39:57,306 --> 00:40:01,721
Rym: they're like the kinds of people Who we are friends with who we'd sit around and talk about.

664
00:40:01,761 --> 00:40:04,290
Rym: man, you know, it's bullshit about the way bad cons are run.

665
00:40:04,752 --> 00:40:06,060
Rym: Yeah, let's run it like packs.

666
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,086
Rym: Well, it's all those people.

667
00:40:07,106 --> 00:40:09,196
Rym: Mm-hmm I can't promise it'll be great.

668
00:40:09,558 --> 00:40:12,289
Scott: But it's the first one and I trust the people.

669
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:18,750
Rym: Yeah No Anime con that's all I can go has ever had as much of a chance as being the packs of anime cons as this one.

670
00:40:19,432 --> 00:40:20,496
Scott: Any other meta things.

671
00:40:20,576 --> 00:40:24,350
Scott: make sure you come and find us on the internet and all the places that we exist on.

672
00:40:24,871 --> 00:40:30,270
Rym: Scott's YouTube channel has the first episode of our judge anime by its cover series that we're going to continue doing.

673
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:42,069
Rym: it channels social media networks things Twitter's and our forum our own website front recruit calm a show that I used to appear on a lot a long time ago And I haven't because I've been busy.

674
00:40:42,512 --> 00:40:47,154
Rym: I made a guest appearance on the most recent Friday night party line Which is surprised that still exists.

675
00:40:47,215 --> 00:40:50,245
Rym: third not only they go in strong, but they're on episode 134.

676
00:40:50,245 --> 00:40:51,690
Scott: I'm surprised that still exists.

677
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:52,935
Rym: Yeah, it was super fun.

678
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:56,690
Rym: I forgot how much fun it is to be on a podcast where one I don't have to plan shit.

679
00:40:57,314 --> 00:41:07,073
Rym: someone else sends me a list of the topics and If I don't have anything to say I can just sit there and be quiet and someone else has got to say something Speaking of things.

680
00:41:07,133 --> 00:41:10,725
Scott: I've I didn't realize that atomic trivia war 9000 still exists.

681
00:41:10,806 --> 00:41:12,130
Rym: Yeah, it's also pretty late.

682
00:41:12,231 --> 00:41:13,458
Rym: I was on it a while.

683
00:41:13,498 --> 00:41:15,510
Scott: God I was on it some months ago.

684
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:17,300
Scott: I completely forgot about it until just now.

685
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:17,944
Scott: it was I think wasn't.

686
00:41:17,964 --> 00:41:19,030
Scott: you were out of town or something.

687
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:22,745
Scott: Yeah, I was on it and I basically was like, oh that still exists.

688
00:41:23,026 --> 00:41:28,530
Scott: Okay, I'll be on it Okay, and then they I wanted extra hard trivia and they made extra hard trivia.

689
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:35,578
Scott: But then when it was like actual Zelda trivia, I just toward it toward it When it was trivia, I actually knew it.

690
00:41:35,778 --> 00:41:37,042
Scott: just I was like, oh, okay.

691
00:41:37,342 --> 00:41:40,210
Rym: What is the thing that dodongo dislike it?

692
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:42,036
Scott: Mmm, is it?

693
00:41:42,681 --> 00:41:43,849
Scott: is it fake smoke?

694
00:41:44,894 --> 00:41:47,869
Scott: Smoke you put in the little electric train.

695
00:41:50,552 --> 00:41:54,949
Scott: So, yeah, uh, what do I bet you'd like to have more of?

696
00:41:56,471 --> 00:42:02,790
Rym: Well, the real answer in my heart is heart containers cookies, but I'll accept more bombs.

697
00:42:04,912 --> 00:42:14,725
Rym: All I gotta say is as a kid I remember when I first met the guy who said I bet you'd like to have more bombs Because I've been so that points like yes, I do bet like.

698
00:42:14,845 --> 00:42:21,955
Rym: up until that point I thought four was like fucking or eight or however is all however many you could get and I would like like.

699
00:42:22,036 --> 00:42:26,969
Rym: I couldn't even imagine the possibility that I could expand that inventory slot like I could.

700
00:42:27,009 --> 00:42:27,310
Rym: my heart.

701
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:33,550
Scott: Yeah, oh one last thing Murder ball, which is pretty much going way downhill.

702
00:42:33,971 --> 00:42:35,977
Scott: Yeah, not only is it going downhill.

703
00:42:36,017 --> 00:42:40,950
Scott: in general the New York football Giants are oh and four, you know what that means.

704
00:42:41,471 --> 00:42:45,563
Scott: When they they were so close to winning like they lost to two of those games.

705
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:47,710
Scott: I'm basically last-second field goals, right?

706
00:42:48,472 --> 00:42:49,656
Scott: The game that they just lost.

707
00:42:49,736 --> 00:42:54,110
Scott: I watched like only the very last second of it and I was actually like hoping they would lose.

708
00:42:54,291 --> 00:42:55,968
Scott: Yeah, it was so much better that way.

709
00:42:57,491 --> 00:42:58,313
Scott: But that doesn't matter.

710
00:42:58,333 --> 00:42:59,336
Scott: We're done with murder ball.

711
00:42:59,356 --> 00:43:00,458
Scott: Goodbye murder ball.

712
00:43:00,498 --> 00:43:01,280
Rym: It's time.

713
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:01,882
Scott: It's time.

714
00:43:01,902 --> 00:43:08,385
Scott: It is I think three days two or three days Until hockey hockey is here.

715
00:43:08,405 --> 00:43:09,914
Rym: Yep I got.

716
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:17,070
Rym: I gotta see if the Red Wings can recover from their reckoning and If the Rangers can at least make it into the playoffs and put a good show.

717
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:20,649
Scott: I think Rangers hockey starts in three days and yeah hockey starts in two day.

718
00:43:21,211 --> 00:43:25,844
Scott: So you're probably listening to this on October 3rd, most likely even though we're recording it.

719
00:43:26,245 --> 00:43:27,128
Scott: the night of October 2nd.

720
00:43:27,931 --> 00:43:29,689
Scott: Hockey is probably tomorrow.

721
00:43:30,171 --> 00:43:31,315
Rym: Yep, baby.

722
00:43:31,355 --> 00:43:35,630
Rym: God the first article when I type Rangers hockey is Rangers in danger of underachieving.

723
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:36,895
Rym: Yeah, it's possible.

724
00:43:36,935 --> 00:43:38,883
Rym: me VC something Kevin a something.

725
00:43:38,903 --> 00:43:40,570
Scott: Yeah, it's entirely possible.

726
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:44,410
Rym: Yep thing is as old as Lundquist is we got still does those saves?

727
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:52,221
Scott: Yeah, we got some old people who are now a year older, you know, we got some new people who are untested Yeah, one of whom appears to be a piece of shit.

728
00:43:52,241 --> 00:43:52,744
Scott: But you know what?

729
00:43:52,865 --> 00:43:53,830
Scott: Oh, yeah the that guy fuck.

730
00:43:53,830 --> 00:43:56,463
Scott: Yeah, right, but can't be worse than Giants.

731
00:43:56,946 --> 00:44:07,269
Scott: No, no Hockey causes less brain damage than murder ball much less Yeah, in fact, they could eliminate the hitting from hockey and people probably wouldn't give a shit.

732
00:44:07,832 --> 00:44:08,375
Scott: No, let's compare.

733
00:44:08,415 --> 00:44:15,285
Scott: I went to see some roller hockey to take photos of it like a week ago And there's basically no hitting in that roller hockey and it was fucking lit.

734
00:44:15,706 --> 00:44:17,594
Scott: It was oh my god There's no spectators.

735
00:44:17,614 --> 00:44:19,842
Rym: You should come to some NWHL games with us this year.

736
00:44:20,284 --> 00:44:21,770
Scott: Well, they're paying the ass to get out there.

737
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:22,353
Rym: They're in Jersey.

738
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:22,453
Rym: Now.

739
00:44:22,514 --> 00:44:23,318
Rym: We stick the path over it.

740
00:44:23,338 --> 00:44:24,544
Scott: I don't have to be asked to get to.

741
00:44:24,845 --> 00:44:25,770
Rym: it's pretty easy.

742
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:28,020
Scott: I have to go through hell literally to get there.

743
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:30,149
Rym: Yeah, but then you get some pretty good hockey.

744
00:44:31,191 --> 00:44:32,195
Scott: Bring it to the the.

745
00:44:32,316 --> 00:44:35,550
Scott: I was able to bicycle and pay zero money to see the roller hockey.

746
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:36,514
Rym: We could bicycle.

747
00:44:36,574 --> 00:44:37,959
Rym: we go up over the GWV.

748
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:38,301
Rym: Yeah.

749
00:44:38,341 --> 00:44:39,907
Rym: No, that'd be a fun ride.

750
00:44:40,067 --> 00:44:40,208
Rym: Yeah.

751
00:44:40,268 --> 00:44:45,260
Rym: No So, yeah, uh, we decided for good or ill.

752
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:58,814
Rym: I'm just gonna warn you guys cuz this is the first show we've done in October that Regardless of what our topic is for the for this entire month We're gonna force ourselves to try to make it spooky themed Spooky podcast.

753
00:44:58,894 --> 00:45:02,750
Scott: all of October and also as you know, the Halloween is the anniversary of GeekNights.

754
00:45:03,312 --> 00:45:04,478
Scott: The first non beta.

755
00:45:04,518 --> 00:45:06,890
Scott: GeekNights was technically a Halloween episode.

756
00:45:07,232 --> 00:45:11,451
Scott: So we released in 2005 and it is now 2017.

757
00:45:11,451 --> 00:45:13,377
Scott: So this is I guess 12 years cuz.

758
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:14,581
Scott: 17 minus 5 is 12.

759
00:45:14,581 --> 00:45:14,802
Rym: Yep.

760
00:45:14,862 --> 00:45:26,699
Rym: The full story is on November 1st We released the first episode of GeekNights to the public not just to the beta listeners and then the next day I list I've re-listened to the beta episode.

761
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:31,573
Rym: we've recorded the previous day on the 31st and I decided it was above the line Of quality.

762
00:45:32,016 --> 00:45:41,876
Rym: so I uploaded it and retroactively posted it Mm-hmm, and that is why the first episode of GeekNights was the second one published and that'll be a trivia question someday Somewhere.

763
00:45:42,381 --> 00:45:43,008
Scott: No, it won't be.

764
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:46,599
Scott: But all right the spooky technology.

765
00:45:46,639 --> 00:45:48,647
Scott: what the hell is spooky about technology.

766
00:45:48,687 --> 00:45:49,269
Scott: This is all you.

767
00:45:49,691 --> 00:45:51,119
Scott: I had the idea, but I don't have.

768
00:45:51,179 --> 00:45:53,350
Scott: I didn't have any actual content, but you wanted to go with it.

769
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:55,287
Rym: Anyway, I got a bunch of ways that could take this.

770
00:45:56,011 --> 00:45:59,320
Rym: So one time I saw a ghost.

771
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:09,389
Rym: I was in my office at IBM a long long time ago and There was a problem with the DHCP network on a network that I was ostensibly responsible for.

772
00:46:10,333 --> 00:46:17,343
Rym: Some of the devices on the network could not get IP addresses But some of them could?

773
00:46:17,363 --> 00:46:18,750
Scott: was it out of IP addresses?

774
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:19,111
Scott: Did it?

775
00:46:19,131 --> 00:46:22,390
Scott: was it like the block was 255 and there was more than that many devices.

776
00:46:22,811 --> 00:46:24,216
Rym: So there was nothing like that.

777
00:46:24,297 --> 00:46:29,817
Rym: like I didn't stop giving out new addresses like I got some logs from the DHCP server Which I administered which so that was easy.

778
00:46:29,837 --> 00:46:33,129
Rym: Yeah, and it had plenty of space and everything was fine.

779
00:46:33,169 --> 00:46:35,450
Rym: then Okay, and there's no like network tickets.

780
00:46:35,991 --> 00:46:37,556
Rym: so I starts to investigate.

781
00:46:37,576 --> 00:46:45,807
Rym: so I go down to the lab and I start going to individual machines and just Trying to do like a release renew or an if config just to see what's going on.

782
00:46:45,907 --> 00:46:46,390
Scott: That sounds good.

783
00:46:46,572 --> 00:46:46,977
Rym: I start with.

784
00:46:46,997 --> 00:46:48,050
Rym: I got all these Linux boxes.

785
00:46:48,211 --> 00:46:58,470
Rym: I deployed all these like Linux thin clients and then it goes came out of the computer and said So what that meant was because I made these machines.

786
00:46:58,972 --> 00:47:06,620
Rym: there was a back door so I could basically go to one and do a thing and enter my credentials and just get a Console and I could just like start fucking around with the network stuff.

787
00:47:07,243 --> 00:47:10,689
Rym: So I started like checking out the DHCP servers working fine.

788
00:47:11,432 --> 00:47:14,882
Rym: So I do a packet capture just in case and everything looks fine.

789
00:47:14,903 --> 00:47:17,370
Rym: Like I see the ad like the DHCP is all happening.

790
00:47:18,331 --> 00:47:20,210
Rym: So the problem is still occurring.

791
00:47:21,074 --> 00:47:29,189
Rym: so then I go to Another one of my thin clients somewhere else on the same like physical network and I do the DHCP renew and it fails.

792
00:47:30,975 --> 00:47:34,898
Scott: It just times out It was too far away from the DHCP server.

793
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:35,801
Scott: It didn't reach in time.

794
00:47:36,222 --> 00:47:46,678
Rym: So man, I Start going I look behind the computer and I see the wires and I see that there's a wire plugged into the back and there And there's a link light.

795
00:47:46,979 --> 00:47:49,410
Rym: but the link light looks weird.

796
00:47:50,912 --> 00:47:53,381
Rym: so I unplug it and the light turns off and I hear a click.

797
00:47:54,525 --> 00:48:01,669
Rym: I plug it back in and After like four seconds, there's a click and the light turns back on.

798
00:48:03,471 --> 00:48:11,809
Rym: So then I follow the cable and it goes to an adapter to a big fucking token ring connector That's plugged into the wall.

799
00:48:13,255 --> 00:48:14,710
Rym: It was token ring.

800
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,393
Scott: So Spooky token ring.

801
00:48:18,794 --> 00:48:23,146
Rym: the DHCP is not working and it was working before it seems to be on token ring.

802
00:48:23,467 --> 00:48:25,876
Rym: Yeah, okay Token rings a loaded.

803
00:48:26,137 --> 00:48:29,290
Scott: I know the token ring is a lower level of OSI stack and you can do that.

804
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:32,801
Rym: But I feel like you shouldn't guys go here some terror stories.

805
00:48:32,841 --> 00:48:35,810
Rym: We can talk a lot about mouse multi access units.

806
00:48:36,172 --> 00:48:37,220
Rym: That's the equivalent matter.

807
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:38,690
Scott: Is that on the same level as token ring?

808
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:44,507
Rym: That's that is the equivalent of a hub or a switch for token ring, okay, they're really complicated.

809
00:48:44,547 --> 00:48:45,330
Rym: they have relays in them.

810
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:53,127
Rym: That's the click Literally relays to add the device to the ring or remove the device from the ring physically.

811
00:48:53,147 --> 00:48:53,528
Rym: Mm-hmm.

812
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:59,850
Rym: So I want to do a packet capture on the actual token ring network to see what's going on.

813
00:49:00,851 --> 00:49:01,936
Rym: There's no way to do that.

814
00:49:02,117 --> 00:49:04,890
Scott: You got to use your trap after you zap it with your pro time.

815
00:49:05,191 --> 00:49:08,062
Rym: So I go to my boss and I say what can I do?

816
00:49:08,082 --> 00:49:09,547
Rym: and he he looks at me.

817
00:49:10,571 --> 00:49:13,061
Rym: He gets this rye smile and he says follow me.

818
00:49:13,081 --> 00:49:15,009
Scott: No, you know the boss knew what to do.

819
00:49:15,472 --> 00:49:23,611
Rym: So he takes me into a part of the data center I've never been but the containment unit and in this room is an EPA guy Dick.

820
00:49:23,832 --> 00:49:27,843
Rym: he hands me a device that looks like a fucking Ghostbusters trap.

821
00:49:27,943 --> 00:49:28,525
Scott: Is it a fluke?

822
00:49:29,247 --> 00:49:30,450
Scott: Is it made by the fluke company?

823
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:31,454
Rym: No, we had flukes.

824
00:49:31,795 --> 00:49:37,862
Rym: and he says this is the only known device To do packet capture on the token ring network.

825
00:49:38,204 --> 00:49:39,630
Rym: and I say what is it?

826
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:47,737
Rym: And he says this is a portable computer from before you existed from before 1982.

827
00:49:47,737 --> 00:49:48,809
Rym: I don't know how old they actually are.

828
00:49:49,231 --> 00:49:58,936
Rym: But so he opens it and sure enough this big fucking metal box is actually a computer like this keyboard comes out of it It's got an orange phosphor screen.

829
00:49:59,317 --> 00:50:04,510
Rym: Mm-hmm, and we boot it and it has some packet capture software on it.

830
00:50:04,891 --> 00:50:11,319
Scott: Okay, and it has token ring connectors and this guy is boss actually knew That that's what that was and knew how to use it.

831
00:50:11,339 --> 00:50:11,399
Scott: Yep.

832
00:50:12,021 --> 00:50:14,410
Rym: Okay, so I take it out there worked.

833
00:50:14,932 --> 00:50:19,389
Rym: so I take it out there and I start doing packet capture a fucking token ring network.

834
00:50:19,409 --> 00:50:34,895
Rym: and I'm looking at the packets and sure enough some of the DHCP requests are working fine and some of them the DHCP server is sending the address back and the machine just isn't acting like it didn't get it At the low level.

835
00:50:34,915 --> 00:50:40,801
Rym: Mm-hmm, and I don't understand even with the packet capture I don't understand needs a new token ring card.

836
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:42,630
Rym: and then I noticed something.

837
00:50:44,514 --> 00:50:47,859
Rym: Some of the packets on the network Were 802.3 frames.

838
00:50:50,692 --> 00:50:55,772
Rym: Some of the packets on the network were ethernet two frames Mm-hmm.

839
00:50:56,615 --> 00:50:59,805
Rym: the old devices were using ethernet.

840
00:50:59,825 --> 00:51:11,750
Rym: to the new devices like the DHCP server we're using 802.3 and The old devices were incapable of handling both formats.

841
00:51:12,111 --> 00:51:15,422
Rym: And if you need to know the details of what the difference is between those two.

842
00:51:15,823 --> 00:51:20,782
Rym: fuck you that is so not Interesting and I don't want to talk about it.

843
00:51:20,902 --> 00:51:22,610
Scott: But did with the packet capture machine.

844
00:51:22,711 --> 00:51:23,597
Scott: How did that one do?

845
00:51:23,618 --> 00:51:25,008
Rym: I guess you didn't give a fuck?

846
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:27,089
Rym: Oh, I guess you're was like, here's the packets.

847
00:51:27,297 --> 00:51:31,161
Rym: Okay and I was looking at the bytes and it was decos decoding the headers.

848
00:51:31,542 --> 00:51:33,549
Rym: and that's when I noticed because I forget.

849
00:51:33,609 --> 00:51:38,277
Rym: but there's like a length field in Ethernet.

850
00:51:38,338 --> 00:51:45,370
Rym: no in 802.3 But there's a type field at the same byte location and ethernet - I don't fucking remember.

851
00:51:45,490 --> 00:51:50,490
Rym: This was a long goddamn time ago to do that again, but I really want to see that capturing computer.

852
00:51:51,414 --> 00:51:51,755
Rym: I'll try.

853
00:51:51,956 --> 00:51:53,060
Rym: I might have taken a picture of it.

854
00:51:53,101 --> 00:51:53,502
Rym: I'll try it.

855
00:51:53,522 --> 00:51:54,627
Rym: I'll try to find that.

856
00:51:54,928 --> 00:51:55,129
Scott: Mm-hmm.

857
00:51:55,471 --> 00:51:57,547
Scott: But yeah, I think you had a phone with a camera.

858
00:51:57,588 --> 00:52:04,210
Rym: then Uh, I had a phone with a camera that I was not allowed to bring anywhere because you couldn't have phones in the facility.

859
00:52:04,411 --> 00:52:05,334
Rym: Mm-hmm.

860
00:52:05,434 --> 00:52:07,120
Rym: Also, you know, I taken a picture with that camera.

861
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:09,689
Rym: I could not have gotten the picture off my phone.

862
00:52:10,132 --> 00:52:11,710
Rym: Mm-hmm, cuz I didn't have the weird cable.

863
00:52:11,951 --> 00:52:15,350
Rym: So you don't have a picture of it, but I might have taken a picture with my fucking actual camera.

864
00:52:15,951 --> 00:52:19,895
Rym: okay, cuz I took pictures of stuff cuz Working at IBM.

865
00:52:19,956 --> 00:52:22,870
Rym: that was like a crazy world of ancient technology.

866
00:52:24,032 --> 00:52:27,769
Scott: So the ghost maybe we can just search for token ring packet capture and find a picture of it.

867
00:52:28,213 --> 00:52:34,490
Rym: So yeah, that was what I was one Avenue I had to take with this show of tell IT troubleshooting stories like they're ghost stories.

868
00:52:35,052 --> 00:52:37,542
Scott: Yeah, you added no ghost in this whatsoever.

869
00:52:37,582 --> 00:52:39,510
Scott: only I did and it was only bad jokes.

870
00:52:39,711 --> 00:52:46,130
Rym: It was it was more just the scare the the investigation of and then I opened the door and there was a missing cable.

871
00:52:47,115 --> 00:52:50,414
Scott: I don't have any scary Technology stories really.

872
00:52:50,434 --> 00:52:52,261
Scott: here's my scary technology story, right?

873
00:52:52,281 --> 00:52:52,783
Scott: All right.

874
00:52:52,803 --> 00:52:53,224
Scott: Here's there.

875
00:52:53,244 --> 00:52:54,750
Scott: Yeah, it's real scary, right?

876
00:52:55,150 --> 00:52:59,475
Scott: So when I was in kindergarten, there was Apple - oh Baby that.

877
00:52:59,495 --> 00:53:02,230
Scott: and I said when I saw that Apple - I said, you know what?

878
00:53:03,071 --> 00:53:06,928
Scott: I've never seen that before but every minute you let me touch that and go touch that.

879
00:53:07,069 --> 00:53:09,590
Scott: Yeah Yeah, and I was so excited to do computer.

880
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:11,576
Scott: I was like, oh baby computer, right.

881
00:53:12,098 --> 00:53:17,967
Scott: and then for my whole life all the way even even when I had a computer in high School and even in college the internet was so fast.

882
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:23,110
Scott: Oh my god I just wanted a computer any second I could computer even when it was like news.

883
00:53:23,251 --> 00:53:26,950
Scott: I got to use some shitty old Solaris machine in the CS lab at alright.

884
00:53:27,673 --> 00:53:30,383
Scott: I was so excited to just use a different kind of computer.

885
00:53:30,464 --> 00:53:31,026
Scott: It was novel.

886
00:53:31,086 --> 00:53:32,030
Scott: I could learn something about it.

887
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:46,997
Scott: Oh, man, and then after actually having a job where I have to sit a computer for eight hours a day every day I Don't want to sit a computer no more and life is lame and Everything is gone.

888
00:53:47,037 --> 00:53:48,526
Scott: And that's the scariest thing of all.

889
00:53:48,546 --> 00:53:49,853
Rym: All right I think it was.

890
00:53:49,933 --> 00:53:51,841
Rym: it might not have been this exact one, but it was kind.

891
00:53:51,881 --> 00:53:52,946
Rym: it was a compact 386 of some kind.

892
00:53:54,772 --> 00:53:55,740
Scott: Okay, so it's not that old.

893
00:53:55,861 --> 00:53:56,769
Scott: No, I'm just.

894
00:53:57,731 --> 00:53:58,312
Scott: I've seen those.

895
00:53:58,473 --> 00:53:58,754
Scott: Yep.

896
00:53:59,014 --> 00:54:02,003
Scott: You could even run Windows on that 20 megahertz on a 386.

897
00:54:02,003 --> 00:54:03,487
Rym: That seems right.

898
00:54:04,048 --> 00:54:04,730
Rym: had a floppy drive.

899
00:54:05,611 --> 00:54:06,876
Rym: Yeah supports Windows 31.

900
00:54:06,876 --> 00:54:07,117
Rym: We did.

901
00:54:07,137 --> 00:54:08,362
Rym: the windows was not on this thing.

902
00:54:08,382 --> 00:54:10,470
Scott: No, you could play doom on that easily.

903
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:12,815
Scott: Easy doom easy doom.

904
00:54:13,758 --> 00:54:16,787
Rym: I think the ISA bus had the token ring card in it.

905
00:54:17,168 --> 00:54:17,389
Scott: Mm-hmm.

906
00:54:17,871 --> 00:54:22,569
Rym: Oh I say yeah, I say bitches PCI came way.

907
00:54:22,871 --> 00:54:26,864
Scott: Everyone now has like your computer has like a PCI Express maybe more than one of them for the.

908
00:54:26,944 --> 00:54:31,645
Scott: that's x16 for your video card And you might have an X and it has some regular PCI Express's.

909
00:54:31,967 --> 00:54:36,024
Scott: back in the day We had ISA and PCI and then they added PCI.

910
00:54:36,044 --> 00:54:36,927
Scott: It was like, holy shit.

911
00:54:36,947 --> 00:54:45,310
Rym: and then AGP and then AGP had a bunch of different flavors and also AGP had three different mutually incompatible voltage standards.

912
00:54:45,731 --> 00:54:46,534
Rym: Oh, yeah, you could.

913
00:54:46,895 --> 00:54:50,227
Rym: you could fuck up a computer bad if you messed up with AGP.

914
00:54:50,528 --> 00:54:52,215
Rym: Mm-hmm ISA card.

915
00:54:52,235 --> 00:54:55,470
Rym: so when I had my old kid, here's a. here's a horror story for the young kids today.

916
00:54:56,610 --> 00:54:59,589
Rym: Computers used to not have any way to connect them to networks.

917
00:55:01,071 --> 00:55:05,688
Scott: So yeah motherboards today have like Ethernet cards built in and some of them even have Wi-Fi built in.

918
00:55:06,592 --> 00:55:06,994
Scott: Used to be.

919
00:55:07,014 --> 00:55:08,661
Scott: you had to buy an Ethernet card.

920
00:55:08,701 --> 00:55:09,966
Scott: Yeah or buy a modem.

921
00:55:10,007 --> 00:55:10,549
Scott: I had a u.s.

922
00:55:10,609 --> 00:55:11,954
Scott: Good I love modem good.

923
00:55:11,974 --> 00:55:15,887
Rym: You had an RS-232 and maybe a parallel port you could plug shit into.

924
00:55:15,907 --> 00:55:28,004
Rym: yeah, and So when I got when we had a modem a 33-6 modem and before that we had a 2400 baud modem We had a 14-4 modem, but then I got a 56 came up.

925
00:55:28,265 --> 00:55:28,968
Rym: Oh, I never had a 56 K.

926
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:45,670
Scott: 14-4 to 56 K. I basically was always one step ahead like everyone else had a 386 and I got a 46 of the 14-4 modem and then everyone else had a Pentium 2 and I got a Pentium 3 with a TNT 2 and a 56 K modem and I was like I was always one step ahead.

927
00:55:45,811 --> 00:55:48,307
Rym: See we had the 2400 baud modem that I used.

928
00:55:48,348 --> 00:55:53,749
Scott: of course The thing is was I really one step ahead or was I actually just buying a computer one year after everyone else?

929
00:55:54,270 --> 00:55:55,900
Scott: Yeah, everyone else had Pentium twos.

930
00:55:55,940 --> 00:56:00,889
Scott: Well, I had a 100 megahertz And then a year later, I'm like, alright enough of that.

931
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:10,970
Rym: But so the reason I didn't upgrade to a 56 K from a 33-6 is because Cable modems like early as beta cable modems got rolled out to my whole neighborhood.

932
00:56:11,111 --> 00:56:12,701
Scott: Yeah, we I don't think we could have got.

933
00:56:12,742 --> 00:56:13,507
Rym: I had a cable modem.

934
00:56:13,628 --> 00:56:16,610
Scott: way There are people in town who had them but we did not have one.

935
00:56:16,991 --> 00:56:22,009
Rym: So when he got a cable modem, we needed to plug an Ethernet into the computer and didn't fucking have that.

936
00:56:23,231 --> 00:56:27,970
Rym: So we only had one PCI card in the one PCI slot in the computer.

937
00:56:28,735 --> 00:56:30,989
Rym: So we got an ISA network card.

938
00:56:31,279 --> 00:56:38,590
Rym: Oh I had a PCI network card But we also already had because I upgraded because I was really into music production even way back then.

939
00:56:39,172 --> 00:56:44,739
Rym: So my parents like as a huge gift got me an all 32 sound card Which was also ISA.

940
00:56:44,819 --> 00:56:47,170
Scott: In that Pentium 3 I got a Sound Blaster Live.

941
00:56:48,172 --> 00:56:55,707
Rym: Yeah, Sound Blaster Live I bought for RIT Mm-hmm, and that actually was kind of in retrospect the Sound Blaster Live was kind of a piece of shit.

942
00:56:55,968 --> 00:57:05,500
Rym: Yeah But the Sound Blaster 16 I had before that was way better, but it was fully backward compatible with the old Sound Blaster stuff Yes, which mattered to no one unless they did.

943
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,828
Rym: MIDI pretty much mattered when I had DOS.

944
00:57:08,149 --> 00:57:09,255
Rym: Yeah Yeah that too.

945
00:57:09,315 --> 00:57:13,170
Scott: It mattered when I ran Linux in 1999.

946
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:33,429
Rym: but the horror story is when I got broadband if I was downloading a file or Visited a website While I was playing music through Winamp because of the nature of the ISA bus the music would stutter as packets came in over the network card.

947
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:43,650
Rym: So I had to do some shenanigans to upgrade to get around that problem and none of you will ever experience that nightmare.

948
00:57:45,595 --> 00:57:46,482
Rym: Wow, the show's almost gone.

949
00:57:46,502 --> 00:57:47,430
Rym: in an hour we could just stop.

950
00:57:47,711 --> 00:57:48,555
Scott: I don't have like.

951
00:57:48,656 --> 00:57:54,190
Scott: I mean I had the idea to do a show with spooky technology stories But I don't actually have spooky technology stories.

952
00:57:54,451 --> 00:57:59,950
Rym: I have a bunch that are only spooky in the sense of problems that couldn't be reproduced that were agonizingly difficult.

953
00:58:00,493 --> 00:58:06,201
Scott: I'm sure there might have been one of those and I may have discussed them on the episode of E-ignites around the time they happened.

954
00:58:06,321 --> 00:58:13,610
Scott: if they happened within the past 12 years or I've just completely forgotten them because my memory is and I don't remember any of that worthless nonsense.

955
00:58:13,811 --> 00:58:16,000
Rym: Yep, whatever are the other way we could have gone with?

956
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:17,044
Rym: the show is talking about.

957
00:58:17,064 --> 00:58:20,275
Rym: we thought about talking about technology That scares us.

958
00:58:20,395 --> 00:58:23,970
Scott: like the problem is not a lot scares me nuclear technology like nuclear weapons.

959
00:58:24,091 --> 00:58:26,747
Scott: Yeah, don't just don't go near it and don't use it on me.

960
00:58:26,828 --> 00:58:33,090
Rym: Yeah What about all the stuff in the show Black Mirror like the technology that might fuck up society and/or us?

961
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:37,169
Scott: I mean, I haven't watched that show but I've read enough sci-fi things and I'm not really scared of them.

962
00:58:37,491 --> 00:58:39,943
Rym: Yeah, but they are scary even if not to us personally.

963
00:58:39,963 --> 00:58:46,170
Scott: Yeah, I mean There's people out there who are scared of like, you know cute bunnies, even though they're not scary.

964
00:58:46,532 --> 00:58:49,250
Scott: That does that mean that cute bunnies are scary?

965
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:54,505
Rym: Yeah, all the people who aren't afraid of bunnies and Monty Python and the Holy Grail we saw it happen to them.

966
00:58:54,525 --> 00:58:55,007
Rym: Uh-huh.

967
00:58:56,090 --> 00:58:56,777
Rym: I Think we need to stop.

968
00:58:56,797 --> 00:58:57,869
Scott: Yeah, I think so.

969
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:08,524
