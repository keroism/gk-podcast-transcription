00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,502
Rym: It's Monday July 24th 2017.

2
00:00:11,502 --> 00:00:12,144
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,365 --> 00:00:14,432
Rym: I was good, and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:14,693 --> 00:00:19,450
Rym: We're talking about passwords Hunter - was it hunter?

5
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:20,820
Rym: - or hunter five whatever that old.

6
00:00:22,561 --> 00:00:23,577
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:26,311 --> 00:00:30,829
Scott: So it's been a long time since I've talked about stu leonard on this show.

8
00:00:31,171 --> 00:00:34,909
Rym: Yes, you know once we stopped living upstate like don't go to stu leonard as often.

9
00:00:34,929 --> 00:00:35,573
Scott: well I mean so.

10
00:00:35,593 --> 00:00:40,759
Scott: when I was a kid we went and I was like a special deal right like Stu leonard was the fancy grocery store.

11
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,230
Scott: before there was Trader Joe's or any other fancy place, right?

12
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,924
Scott: It was pretty much supermarket and stu leonard was another thing.

13
00:00:45,964 --> 00:00:47,030
Scott: It was completely different.

14
00:00:47,473 --> 00:00:52,930
Rym: It was like the IKEA of groceries and when I worked in Yonkers I literally worked like right next to the one there.

15
00:00:53,252 --> 00:00:55,770
Rym: So I would stop there on the way home to Pekin like right once a week.

16
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:58,070
Scott: Well, but it was only one of when I was a kid.

17
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:00,890
Scott: There's only one in Connecticut and then they open a few more.

18
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:01,937
Scott: There's still not that many.

19
00:01:01,998 --> 00:01:04,997
Scott: you only can go to it if you're in New York Connecticut kind of area.

20
00:01:05,058 --> 00:01:07,130
Rym: most important part about stu leonards is that turkey chili?

21
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:10,665
Scott: But anyway, you mean the chicken chili with beans whatever what it was it was.

22
00:01:10,706 --> 00:01:13,489
Scott: Oh, that's I guess That's what I'm gonna eat cuz that's in my fridge.

23
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:20,438
Scott: So, you know, I haven't been to one since in like super long time Because I don't have a car.

24
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:28,344
Scott: I used to when I would drive from Pekin to Connecticut I would pass by the one in Danbury off 84 But I haven't been to one in so long.

25
00:01:28,365 --> 00:01:41,005
Scott: So I went to one yesterday no Saturday and The Yonkers one and it's pretty much the same as it was was before, you know They had all like the same foods that they've always had that gorgonzola salad.

26
00:01:41,106 --> 00:01:43,856
Scott: Oh that gorgonzola salad Pretty much everything that they.

27
00:01:43,876 --> 00:01:45,602
Rym: you know, I just make that salad now.

28
00:01:45,863 --> 00:01:47,670
Scott: Yeah, but they sell like the full filet mignon.

29
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,619
Scott: It's like they sell everything they always sold.

30
00:01:50,082 --> 00:01:51,810
Scott: I didn't notice a lot of new stuff there.

31
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,050
Scott: You can still scoop pistachio nuts on the scoop, right?

32
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:57,930
Rym: I saw you're in some of those pistachios, but obviously you wouldn't bring this up if there wasn't something different.

33
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:06,453
Scott: Yeah, so the thing that's two letters is most known for which is the reason it was a special occasion to go there when I was a kid in the 80s 90s.

34
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:07,697
Scott: whatever is that?

35
00:02:07,718 --> 00:02:11,269
Scott: the store is full of animatronic shit like like five nights at Freddy's.

36
00:02:11,691 --> 00:02:19,062
Scott: yeah, pretty much like, you know, the Confederate dog and Singing right and the.

37
00:02:20,776 --> 00:02:27,915
Scott: You know This the milk carton singing and the Chiquita banana singing and the cow that you push the button and it goes move And all that stuff.

38
00:02:27,975 --> 00:02:38,570
Scott: so the one in Yonkers, I'd actually never been to that one before but that's the one we went to and It had way less Animatronic shit, I guess that's better than I've been in the past.

39
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:48,969
Scott: The only thing that was in there was a singing tree from Poland spring water The the dog and cow singing with the banjo and the right the Civil War dog and cow.

40
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:59,790
Scott: and There were a few of those, you know, like monkeys that keep flipping over a bar over and over again The bars in this video right here, they didn't have the cow that goes moo and you push the button.

41
00:02:59,871 --> 00:03:01,362
Scott: They didn't have the singing milk cartons.

42
00:03:01,403 --> 00:03:02,310
Scott: They didn't have any of that stuff.

43
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:07,950
Scott: So it's like I think the most of that stuff was always at the original Westport, Connecticut location.

44
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:14,308
Rym: I feel like that is like the 90s mall animatronics era, but it was before the 90s.

45
00:03:14,348 --> 00:03:15,010
Scott: this stuff, right?

46
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:15,566
Scott: It was you know.

47
00:03:15,891 --> 00:03:20,170
Scott: And then it's more like Stu Leonard is more like a Casa Bonita with the diving.

48
00:03:20,512 --> 00:03:21,095
Scott: It's like it was.

49
00:03:21,115 --> 00:03:28,266
Scott: they had a unique thing that only they had But that thing has been toned down in these other locations.

50
00:03:28,286 --> 00:03:29,390
Rym: Well, there's only two alternatives.

51
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:36,015
Rym: I'm not sure what's changed in the many years since I've been there with animatronics because it amusement parks at malls And I guess it's do Leonard's.

52
00:03:36,176 --> 00:03:38,246
Rym: there's only two ways animatronics can go.

53
00:03:38,266 --> 00:03:48,289
Rym: either they get scaled back over time because that's ancient archaic technology or They become decrepit and I guess you can keep maintaining him and scaling them up.

54
00:03:48,953 --> 00:03:56,990
Rym: I feel like yeah, I have an expert person I feel like there is no interest in the world that I feel like animatronics are a dying art that will just disappear.

55
00:03:57,131 --> 00:04:04,330
Scott: So I think it actually you know It seems like it, you know, the one kind of logic is like they have it because it's quirky, right?

56
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:08,204
Scott: Just because no and then you get rid of it because we're spending money on this thing.

57
00:04:08,224 --> 00:04:10,988
Scott: that obviously isn't increasing our business It's just costing us money, right?

58
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:18,930
Scott: But I think in the day of internet You actually want to have that thing because it gives you a reason to go to the grocery store.

59
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:19,695
Rym: Ah, but you would.

60
00:04:19,714 --> 00:04:34,390
Rym: that's not just you know Fresh direct you would craft it a little bit differently then you would want to craft it in such a way that People there would have a reason to do Mimi nonsense around it and she read it around.

61
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:39,990
Scott: I think it just makes your store into a. you know, you get tourists to come to your store Which is a regular grocery store.

62
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:57,025
Scott: The thing is about Stu Leonard is that even back in the day Even if you lived close to it, it would be weird to use that as your everyday grocery store Because you got to walk along this path with very little opportunities to cut across Like IKEA where you have to go along the path and see everything.

63
00:04:57,045 --> 00:05:00,830
Scott: It's like that You can't just go in get an egg and come out.

64
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:09,475
Scott: You got to go through the whole store and pass all the things And if I recall correctly when we would go we would buy a lot of nonsense But our path.

65
00:05:09,515 --> 00:05:19,430
Scott: the other thing about Stu Leonard's is that you only when you go there you pretty much only buy Stu Leonard brand Stuff because that's the reason you're going there is to get stuff that they have that no one else has.

66
00:05:20,193 --> 00:05:24,270
Scott: You don't go there to get like brand name stuff because they overcharge up the ass.

67
00:05:26,452 --> 00:05:30,331
Scott: Big time is like you go in there and it's like oh bag of chips $5.

68
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:34,511
Scott: and then you go over and it's like oh another bag of chips for $5.

69
00:05:34,511 --> 00:05:43,718
Scott: But these are stews made in store daily kettles sweet potato chips, and it's like if you buy some Lays It's like alright.

70
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:49,422
Scott: I'll give you a fucking $5 or a bag of giant Chips, but them lays for $5.

71
00:05:49,422 --> 00:05:53,724
Scott: You can shove that where the Sun don't shine The Sun don't shine in my mouth.

72
00:05:53,805 --> 00:05:57,009
Scott: So Not putting lays in my mouth.

73
00:05:57,572 --> 00:06:01,953
Rym: So anyway in the news is a bunch of like little news is that I think are worth Mentioning?

74
00:06:01,973 --> 00:06:04,930
Rym: and I think first off is that this is a little bit old.

75
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:14,170
Rym: But it's probably moderately important because if you're not aware There's a lot of ways to encode video like if you then the like you might look at the extension.

76
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,101
Scott: It's a lot crazier than and like image encoding.

77
00:06:17,142 --> 00:06:18,326
Scott: because you know, you have a JPEG.

78
00:06:18,366 --> 00:06:19,270
Scott: It's named JPEG.

79
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,629
Scott: It's you know, the file extensions map one to one.

80
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:29,510
Scott: Yeah with the kind of file But with videos you have containers and encoding and you are you cloud it and code the audio and the video with two different codex.

81
00:06:29,651 --> 00:06:31,789
Scott: Yeah, and you can do all sorts of crazy combination.

82
00:06:33,131 --> 00:06:34,736
Rym: Usually there's lots.

83
00:06:34,756 --> 00:06:38,226
Scott: this is why things like VLC are not, you know are important?

84
00:06:38,246 --> 00:06:40,514
Scott: because they get that shit playing right what?

85
00:06:40,836 --> 00:06:49,407
Rym: and there's lots of ways to encode video and one of the more recent like pushes forward is h.265 and all the stuff under that.

86
00:06:49,989 --> 00:07:09,590
Rym: but Hulu Netflix and Amazon are at least working together Ostensibly to use a royalty-free format that they're calling AV one that should perform similarly if not better than a shot to 65 But more importantly quote will be licensed under royalty-free terms for all use cases.

87
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:17,330
Scott: that's extra important because They want people to make devices and software that lets you watch Amazon Netflix and whatever.

88
00:07:17,511 --> 00:07:22,950
Scott: So let me say unless if it's just one of those services people aren't gonna have an incentive to implement it.

89
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:25,610
Scott: But if it's like oh, this is the thing that every service is using.

90
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:29,230
Scott: We better create decoders for this and put them in all of our products.

91
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,840
Rym: Well, like I have a camcorder that'll record a.

92
00:07:32,181 --> 00:07:39,650
Scott: now if you start up some other video service And you don't use this codec You might find that people can't use your service because that your videos don't play.

93
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:39,972
Scott: It's not

94
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:54,784
Rym: just that though because one of the biggest reasons why a lot like there's been so much trouble especially say in the 90s and early 2000s was that To make any codecs better you just be violating someone's patent Mm-hmm, and there was basically no way to innovate in that space.

95
00:07:55,165 --> 00:07:56,250
Rym: and even big companies.

96
00:07:56,895 --> 00:08:04,184
Rym: But they'd have sort of this mutually assured Destruction of equal and opposing patents and they'd sort of just come to this unsteady Cold War truce.

97
00:08:04,806 --> 00:08:12,430
Rym: So open codecs Basically remove the primary source of friction for a lot of the media industry.

98
00:08:12,812 --> 00:08:22,230
Rym: So unless you're Sony in the old days you have a vested interest in removing that friction Because it'll help your competitors, but it'll also help you and you'll all just make more.

99
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:27,650
Scott: The other thing is that all of these companies with the big big video game like YouTube and such right?

100
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,098
Scott: They use so much fucking bandwidth.

101
00:08:30,138 --> 00:08:33,615
Rym: So even if they can get so much CPU as well That's like.

102
00:08:33,635 --> 00:08:35,390
Rym: that's not a trivial concern.

103
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:48,529
Scott: But the point is even a small savings a tiny savings like of a fraction of a percent Multiplied by all the videos they have and all the videos they send out will save them More money than you have in like a day.

104
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,376
Rym: If they

105
00:08:50,456 --> 00:09:07,348
Scott: team up to improve codecs with more brain power they can make a bet even better codec that squishes things even smaller without losing quality and Thus all of them will save even more money Whereas if they just worked on their own codecs individually, none of them would be as good.

106
00:09:08,011 --> 00:09:14,924
Rym: The all use cases part is probably the most important part because my camcorder at least one of my camcorders It has a uses AVCHD like.

107
00:09:14,944 --> 00:09:17,355
Rym: that's the thing it uses But old and crappy.

108
00:09:17,535 --> 00:09:20,405
Rym: Yeah, but that it was the state of the art when I bought that camcorder.

109
00:09:20,425 --> 00:09:21,850
Scott: Yeah, it has its uses still.

110
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:27,550
Rym: Yeah, it does but and I have other cameras that use other codecs or have different options.

111
00:09:27,871 --> 00:09:52,710
Rym: But most of the cameras I own have notes buried in the manuals that came with them Saying things like you have a license to use this list of codecs for home personal use only Technically you can't use these these transitionary formats from a lot of Consumer or prosumer devices in a commercial endeavor and most people don't worry about those things don't think about those things.

112
00:09:52,750 --> 00:10:08,206
Rym: But technically like by using that camcorder in certain situations like in a monetized video on YouTube If I may or may not have been violated it's because you Transcoded it in Adobe Media Encoder before you put it on YouTube and then you're not even using that codec.

113
00:10:08,267 --> 00:10:09,370
Scott: YouTube is how do they?

114
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:12,430
Scott: Even know what codec you use because YouTube is then using its codecs to deliver.

115
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:15,069
Scott: They don't even know what the original video was uploaded with.

116
00:10:15,109 --> 00:10:16,576
Rym: actually I remember researching and they can't.

117
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:25,630
Rym: they only YouTube could tell them it's actually really debatable What counts as personal use and whether or not like use in the camera and then transcoding counts or not?

118
00:10:25,951 --> 00:10:26,031
Scott: And

119
00:10:26,072 --> 00:10:28,280
Rym: basically, it's just a nightmare that

120
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:37,061
Scott: just words that lawyers wrote somewhere, you know Because that's how they do and it doesn't actually count and no one's ever tried to fight or and if they did they probably get it appears

121
00:10:37,081 --> 00:10:45,270
Rym: a lot of that is because the Licensing fees and royalties for these codecs were much less if you were restricted from using them in commercial capacities.

122
00:10:45,732 --> 00:10:55,309
Rym: The idea was that they charge the people who sell the studio camera way more money for the license But they can't charge that much for like dumpy thousand-dollar camcorder, right?

123
00:10:55,470 --> 00:11:00,669
Rym: well, there's also countries where like Europe Europe is like has a war on video.

124
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:08,589
Scott: a Camera that can record video longer than 30 minutes is considered a professional video camera So and there's an extra tax on professional video equipment there.

125
00:11:09,132 --> 00:11:20,830
Scott: So all these cameras that could otherwise record forever But for no reason have artificial limits in them there that forced them to only record 29 minutes and 59 seconds in a single video.

126
00:11:21,672 --> 00:11:22,576
Rym: One has that per GX.

127
00:11:22,596 --> 00:11:23,280
Rym: one has that problem.

128
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,169
Scott: you have to push the video record button again.

129
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:35,540
Scott: Yep, you know the Sony a7 which is like one of the top video cameras has that limitation everywhere in the world, but the Panasonic gh5 I think has that limitation nowhere in the world.

130
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,150
Scott: the gh4 they made different versions for different parts of the world.

131
00:11:38,211 --> 00:11:39,827
Scott: You know every all these all these crazy things.

132
00:11:42,691 --> 00:11:46,224
Rym: Pretty sure there's only one version of the gx-1 and it had the limitation everywhere.

133
00:11:46,385 --> 00:11:46,565
Scott: Yeah.

134
00:11:46,786 --> 00:11:51,245
Scott: Well, it's not a video camera It's a camera that has video because every camera has video in the year 2017.

135
00:11:51,245 --> 00:11:57,189
Rym: Yeah I am thinking about just buying a legit studio camcorder because they're not actually that much money.

136
00:11:57,209 --> 00:12:03,410
Rym: and Especially if we do our convention and all that stuff we're talking about one of those would be way useful.

137
00:12:04,092 --> 00:12:05,096
Rym: So I'm looking into that.

138
00:12:05,337 --> 00:12:05,920
Scott: do whatever you want.

139
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,622
Scott: So is your money?

140
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,225
Rym: there's some other.

141
00:12:07,365 --> 00:12:08,550
Rym: well, it might be the patreon's money.

142
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:10,163
Scott: That's my beach money.

143
00:12:10,203 --> 00:12:10,750
Scott: Don't touch that.

144
00:12:11,691 --> 00:12:17,370
Rym: So in other news you might have seen that there was a Pokemon go fest and if you didn't see that well good job.

145
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:18,483
Rym: I'm glad you avoided it.

146
00:12:19,451 --> 00:12:25,630
Scott: There's a convention for a single game Pokemon go that single free to play zero skill game.

147
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:30,365
Scott: That game is big enough still that they could have a convention and get people to show up.

148
00:12:30,405 --> 00:12:31,167
Scott: and not only that.

149
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:42,016
Scott: but they had Smaller not super, you know There's only one event in Chicago was actually endorsed and supported by Niantic the company that makes You know Pokemon go.

150
00:12:42,478 --> 00:12:59,905
Rym: but there were other sort of semi official Maybe real events around the world all the same time and it was a disaster for the reasons that like I don't know how Professionals everywhere especially like nerd professionals at a game company fail at this.

151
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:01,570
Rym: they it's sold out like right away.

152
00:13:01,731 --> 00:13:13,162
Rym: So they had a long time between when they sold their stupid tickets and when the event happened To plan for this and at no point did anyone say hey What's gonna happen if all these people show up in a park and try to use their cell phones?

153
00:13:14,105 --> 00:13:15,730
Rym: and yeah, nothing worked.

154
00:13:15,972 --> 00:13:16,375
Rym: No one could.

155
00:13:16,456 --> 00:13:21,358
Rym: no one could play Pokemon go Pokemon go fast all the events that they had.

156
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:40,186
Rym: they had to fake the results because no one could actually play at all And because it was in a park they couldn't even do the kinds of things that like big convention centers or sports arenas do because those usually involve having Wi-Fi antennas up in the sky pointing down in limited cones.

157
00:13:40,206 --> 00:13:53,770
Rym: You'd have to get you know Deployable equipment and spread it around but the the method that is the most effective at giving a large Numbers of a large group of people in a small area service won't work if you can't put the antennas above them.

158
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:54,211
Scott: That's right.

159
00:13:54,252 --> 00:13:59,470
Scott: this I've seen these things like I've seen like AT&T deploy these at like events is basically a box.

160
00:13:59,954 --> 00:14:09,510
Scott: Yeah has a generator in it But it also plugs in and it has this big stick coming out the top with a little thingy on it And you basically bring a whole bunch of these to like a music festival or whatever.

161
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:12,225
Scott: Right and they set them up all over the place.

162
00:14:12,265 --> 00:14:17,490
Scott: now it actually works But you have to tell them this is happening and they did not so they could have like that.

163
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:20,550
Scott: You know if they were smart they could even like called like Verizon and t-mobile.

164
00:14:20,751 --> 00:14:21,876
Rym: I think there's a difference though.

165
00:14:21,936 --> 00:14:24,004
Scott: I've gotten like a partnership and a sponsorship.

166
00:14:24,024 --> 00:14:25,370
Scott: There is a very important difference.

167
00:14:26,771 --> 00:14:29,589
Rym: Unlike normal events This is an event where?

168
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:33,405
Rym: Literally everyone is going to be using a lot of data on their phone the entire time.

169
00:14:33,425 --> 00:14:36,950
Scott: you think people are using a lot of Data on their phone or all the entire time in a music festival.

170
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:42,090
Rym: I don't think 90 plus percent of them are at any given moment for the entire concert.

171
00:14:42,331 --> 00:14:46,150
Scott: No, but the number of people the music festival is much larger.

172
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:49,957
Rym: Usage is being bigger than most music.

173
00:14:50,018 --> 00:14:51,081
Scott: How big was this thing?

174
00:14:51,101 --> 00:14:54,290
Scott: I had another website actual number on turns.

175
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,636
Rym: Well, it's only one day event.

176
00:14:55,998 --> 00:14:56,239
Scott: Mm-hmm.

177
00:14:56,902 --> 00:14:58,288
Scott: The point is I'm pretty sure right.

178
00:14:58,871 --> 00:15:04,029
Scott: They tell them how many people they could have handled it, right if they call them They just didn't even think about it or do anything because they're morons.

179
00:15:04,331 --> 00:15:08,044
Rym: I actually don't think they could have handled it because of how much data.

180
00:15:08,064 --> 00:15:10,536
Scott: I think it's definitely possible Because of how much data.

181
00:15:10,556 --> 00:15:12,670
Scott: that game is just a fire festival situation.

182
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:24,190
Scott: people don't know how to run an event because there's so many things involved in running an event that you you need this Extremely large body of knowledge to handle all these different areas from like first aid stations.

183
00:15:25,031 --> 00:15:26,896
Scott: You know fucking toilets.

184
00:15:26,936 --> 00:15:29,946
Scott: You got a handle, you know, there's vendors.

185
00:15:29,986 --> 00:15:30,608
Rym: No, but here's.

186
00:15:30,628 --> 00:15:31,390
Scott: so here's the other thing.

187
00:15:32,552 --> 00:15:35,912
Scott: So much shit, you got a handle Stuff.

188
00:15:36,173 --> 00:15:37,559
Rym: they didn't even handle the basic stuff.

189
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,230
Scott: They literally right just like fire festival.

190
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:42,504
Rym: It was like well, no fire festival was a scam.

191
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:43,350
Rym: that wasn't a matter of not.

192
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:53,061
Scott: I'm just saying people running an event who don't do all the things necessary to run the event because they don't know all the things necessary To fire festival didn't even do anything.

193
00:15:53,101 --> 00:15:53,984
Rym: that was just a scam.

194
00:15:54,205 --> 00:15:55,429
Scott: I'm pretty they did some stuff.

195
00:15:56,934 --> 00:15:57,639
Scott: It was just a mega.

196
00:15:57,659 --> 00:15:59,210
Rym: an event wasn't even prepared.

197
00:15:59,471 --> 00:16:04,550
Rym: So like all they're like all their stuff like the rooms you could render over were just fake like it was just all fake.

198
00:16:05,196 --> 00:16:08,214
Scott: I don't think it was a hundred percent fake Pictures of stuff.

199
00:16:08,636 --> 00:16:10,081
Rym: Yeah, I read a lot about the event.

200
00:16:10,101 --> 00:16:14,555
Scott: Also the tumbling con with it with the with the On ball pit.

201
00:16:14,655 --> 00:16:15,318
Rym: Oh dash con was.

202
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:16,342
Rym: it was what you're describing.

203
00:16:16,423 --> 00:16:17,387
Rym: it's just a better example.

204
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,030
Scott: They're all the same.

205
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:18,333
Scott: They're all.

206
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,890
Scott: it's basically an event.

207
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,220
Scott: It doesn't have all the things an event needs but you're missing.

208
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:29,312
Scott: how the thing is if you have it a big event if it's big Enough if you're missing even one thing you just ruin everything Everything.

209
00:16:29,432 --> 00:16:36,149
Rym: so there were four our lines to get in because they never at any point considered How they would get all these people into the park.

210
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:45,551
Rym: no one that they knew the exact number of people would show up and You can calculate how many people get through a turnstile at a time and they literally just Couldn't even make that happen Didn't

211
00:16:45,571 --> 00:17:00,789
Scott: even think about it because they had no event running experience and they didn't hire someone to help run the event or anything Like that - that would say hey, you know You need to think about how to get the people in the park Like it doesn't you know, if you've never done something it doesn't cross your mind the things involved in it.

212
00:17:01,072 --> 00:17:02,210
Scott: It's true for everything in the world.

213
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:05,183
Scott: Someone goes into like a wood shop and they never made or anything out of wood before.

214
00:17:05,204 --> 00:17:12,170
Scott: they just start doing it with no Experience or studying or knowledge or preparation or help from anyone and there's gonna be so many things they overlook.

215
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:17,309
Scott: They're just gonna make this fucked up thing throw it out and learn some lessons and start again.

216
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:23,241
Scott: but if that first time you do it is In some practice piece of wood where you don't care.

217
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,348
Scott: It's the real deal with thousands of people.

218
00:17:25,952 --> 00:17:26,957
Rym: That's a big fucking problem.

219
00:17:26,977 --> 00:17:29,890
Rym: The thing is from what I can gather they did have professional event people.

220
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,736
Rym: I think it's just even people in this profession.

221
00:17:31,756 --> 00:17:35,829
Scott: find out who those people are and don't hire them for your event because they're fuck-ups.

222
00:17:36,613 --> 00:17:37,316
Scott: but the moral is.

223
00:17:37,336 --> 00:17:52,550
Rym: there's a real fundamental moral here and the moral is Don't ever make an event that relies on cellular networks or Wi-Fi full stop Because if you're at a large gathering of people you must assume that the internet will not work.

224
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:58,000
Scott: And if you are hosting a large gathering of human beings You must assume that it will be an internet dead zone.

225
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:09,110
Rym: Even if it's in like the middle of Tokyo or something The Penny Arcade Expo did once an omega-thon finale that involved Wi-Fi just on the stage and it couldn't work.

226
00:18:09,792 --> 00:18:13,005
Rym: It could not work and they knew exactly what they were doing.

227
00:18:13,366 --> 00:18:14,692
Rym: if they can't make it happen No one can.

228
00:18:14,712 --> 00:18:18,810
Scott: however that convention center now has perhaps the best conventions that are Wi-Fi I've experienced.

229
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:24,730
Rym: However, the method that it uses to provide that is a method that literally cannot be deployed in outdoor arenas.

230
00:18:24,891 --> 00:18:32,957
Scott: It can if you've deployed many many boxes that have long tall sticks on them that aim down Which I don't think has ever been deployed.

231
00:18:32,977 --> 00:18:34,964
Scott: that system is a music festivals.

232
00:18:35,004 --> 00:18:36,469
Scott: I've seen it with my own eyeballs.

233
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:37,895
Rym: No, so that this is a thing.

234
00:18:37,935 --> 00:18:38,798
Scott: they have that.

235
00:18:38,878 --> 00:18:39,742
Rym: Did you read the paper?

236
00:18:39,762 --> 00:18:41,910
Rym: We linked to on the BCEC system.

237
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:42,995
Rym: It's a stationary system.

238
00:18:43,015 --> 00:18:48,709
Scott: It's not the thing you're thinking of for music festivals and is a you can deploy Something that will give everyone service.

239
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:55,929
Rym: Are tightly targeted to some shockingly small geographic areas inside of the BCEC.

240
00:18:56,952 --> 00:19:02,570
Rym: Anyway, don't if you went to Pokemon go fest I don't know what you were expecting because it's what could possibly have happened.

241
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:06,030
Scott: I mean if you're a sad person who's so sad that you're playing Pokemon go like that?

242
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:08,178
Scott: You deserve what you got a Pokemon go fest.

243
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,969
Scott: Maybe it'll teach you to not waste your life playing Pokemon go.

244
00:19:11,471 --> 00:19:16,030
Rym: Well because well, I mean it has its purpose that it got some people to walk around outside.

245
00:19:16,191 --> 00:19:18,682
Scott: I feel like I want to make a bad game that gets really popular.

246
00:19:18,722 --> 00:19:23,681
Scott: get everyone to come to an event and then use the Whole event to be like look this whole thing was a trap guys.

247
00:19:23,721 --> 00:19:25,006
Rym: That's just the plot of the wave.

248
00:19:25,407 --> 00:19:29,423
Rym: only with Nazis Mmm, that's exactly the plot of the wave.

249
00:19:29,443 --> 00:19:29,925
Rym: Mm-hmm.

250
00:19:31,191 --> 00:19:35,310
Rym: So in some other news that people are shockingly mad about Microsoft is killing MS paint.

251
00:19:36,032 --> 00:19:39,243
Rym: So what a lot of people are really mad about this is another.

252
00:19:39,263 --> 00:19:49,670
Scott: there's a new paint thing in my in Windows now that just old paint is also there Although nothing more than update to Windows is removing MS paint.

253
00:19:49,871 --> 00:19:52,621
Scott: So, you know what right now if you're upset about this is what you do.

254
00:19:53,143 --> 00:19:54,127
Scott: paint is one file.

255
00:19:54,167 --> 00:19:54,890
Scott: paint that exe.

256
00:19:55,692 --> 00:20:00,530
Scott: Even if you don't save your copy of paint that exe it is readily available on the internet.

257
00:20:00,911 --> 00:20:02,957
Scott: So I'll not a copy of paint dot exe.

258
00:20:03,278 --> 00:20:08,389
Scott: put it like on your fucking desktop or whatever and just double-click on that Motherfucker whenever you want some paint.

259
00:20:08,611 --> 00:20:11,621
Rym: So the most amazing thing is I was reading comments on reddit slash dot.

260
00:20:11,661 --> 00:20:24,331
Rym: people are actually mad about this and the primary complaints are people who claim to use it professionally in their day-to-day work and Yet for whatever reason like never thought to use a real Application.

261
00:20:24,572 --> 00:20:25,354
Scott: paint on point.

262
00:20:25,374 --> 00:20:29,826
Scott: paint on net is free free zero dollars and they make ridiculous arguments about.

263
00:20:30,066 --> 00:20:33,100
Rym: but my computer's locked down So I can't install anything.

264
00:20:33,321 --> 00:20:33,884
Scott: quit your job.

265
00:20:33,944 --> 00:20:34,850
Scott: get to go to her real work.

266
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:43,621
Scott: Well, if your job requires you to be able to draw terrible pictures and ask IT and say I need to be able to use A paint program in order to do my job.

267
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:45,170
Scott: I cannot do it without a paint program.

268
00:20:45,532 --> 00:20:46,821
Scott: You've removed MS paint.

269
00:20:46,942 --> 00:20:49,697
Scott: Give me a paint for also I'd realize or I cannot do.

270
00:20:49,718 --> 00:20:50,662
Rym: I realize pretty quickly.

271
00:20:50,702 --> 00:20:54,013
Rym: a lot of the people complaining Don't realize?

272
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:58,910
Rym: the snipping tool exists and has existed for a long time and they use it what they use MS paint for this.

273
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,535
Rym: I think this is the majority use case.

274
00:21:00,856 --> 00:21:10,990
Rym: is they hit print screen and then they paste the print screen into MS paint And then they crop it because they literally have never heard of the snip tool that's been around for a long time.

275
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:11,433
Scott: Yeah You know what?

276
00:21:11,454 --> 00:21:12,790
Scott: I do on my Microsoft Surface.

277
00:21:13,152 --> 00:21:23,428
Scott: I take them the pencil and I click the eraser area because it clicks in Yeah, and then this thing shows up on the right side of the screen and one of them says Screenshot sketch or something like that.

278
00:21:23,871 --> 00:21:31,152
Scott: So I touch it and now it has a screenshot of my screen already in a paint thing and I can doodle on it or crop It or whatever.

279
00:21:31,192 --> 00:21:31,593
Rym: I do one better.

280
00:21:31,613 --> 00:21:33,841
Rym: Just hit the windows key type snip.

281
00:21:34,323 --> 00:21:35,407
Rym: Yeah, I did the wrong one.

282
00:21:35,447 --> 00:21:44,660
Rym: But anyway windows key Snip and you get the snipping tool and you can literally just get an arbitrary screenshot Yep, and you can doodle on it.

283
00:21:45,121 --> 00:21:48,937
Rym: Yep, and then I can copy to my clipboard Save it as a file.

284
00:21:49,178 --> 00:21:50,203
Rym: I could even email it.

285
00:21:50,244 --> 00:21:51,469
Rym: I guess like directly.

286
00:21:51,771 --> 00:21:52,877
Scott: Is it what hat people?

287
00:21:53,219 --> 00:21:55,269
Scott: many people learn a way to do something?

288
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,356
Scott: Yeah, as long as it gets the job done.

289
00:21:57,436 --> 00:22:00,850
Scott: people except nerds don't give a shit about efficiency.

290
00:22:01,091 --> 00:22:01,774
Scott: They really don't.

291
00:22:01,855 --> 00:22:05,170
Scott: very few people care about efficiency or learning anything new.

292
00:22:05,413 --> 00:22:06,668
Scott: They have a way of doing a thing.

293
00:22:06,972 --> 00:22:08,874
Scott: They hate learning so they keep.

294
00:22:08,914 --> 00:22:15,296
Scott: they want to be able to just keep doing things the way they do them for the rest of their entire life and Never have to learn anything new ever.

295
00:22:15,698 --> 00:22:20,994
Scott: and that these are the people that I do not respect and would not hire and do not Want to work with ever.

296
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:27,540
Scott: so I could pretty much do job interviews and just be like, you know Would you be upset if there was a new way of doing a thing?

297
00:22:27,641 --> 00:22:29,930
Scott: or like test someone in some way to see if which?

298
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,033
Scott: Kind of person they are?

299
00:22:31,053 --> 00:22:34,405
Scott: I just hire all that even if they don't have any knowledge or skills.

300
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:38,530
Scott: if they're the kind of person Who wants to improve their way of doing things?

301
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:41,509
Scott: I know that that person will be able to do any job pretty much.

302
00:22:42,012 --> 00:22:55,253
Rym: But the other thing is from a like pure just software perspective I think it's probably good because I would rather the OS like this doesn't seem like a necessary function of OS is anymore to have a Drop picked a.

303
00:22:55,714 --> 00:22:57,720
Scott: I wish my my drawing application.

304
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:01,130
Scott: I think it's I think it's problem that Windows fucking comes with anything, right?

305
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:03,539
Scott: It's like they pre-installed all this garbage, right?

306
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:06,170
Scott: It's like you get all the it's like the Cortana and stuff.

307
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:08,679
Scott: It's like give me Windows that comes with fucking nothing.

308
00:23:08,719 --> 00:23:09,482
Rym: That's called Linux.

309
00:23:10,145 --> 00:23:11,590
Scott: I'm just saying right that's called Linux.

310
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:14,903
Scott: They could make Windows that comes with absolutely nothing.

311
00:23:14,923 --> 00:23:15,747
Scott: No one wants that.

312
00:23:15,988 --> 00:23:16,510
Scott: I want that.

313
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,314
Rym: I don't even want that.

314
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:21,634
Scott: cuz how many to you and Steven if you clean install Windows these days Right clean install.

315
00:23:21,674 --> 00:23:27,050
Scott: you have to go uninstalling a bunch of shit like what like nowadays if you install the Windows 10 recently.

316
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,816
Rym: Yeah, I remove some stuff.

317
00:23:28,856 --> 00:23:30,763
Scott: I think they put like the knowledge the Cortana.

318
00:23:30,783 --> 00:23:36,383
Scott: they put like Candy Crush installer OneDrive, please get Microsoft Office.

319
00:23:36,423 --> 00:23:37,610
Scott: annoying thing.

320
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:39,596
Rym: I don't sell the Microsoft Office thing.

321
00:23:39,656 --> 00:23:42,545
Scott: the whole big fat start menu full ads.

322
00:23:42,585 --> 00:23:43,989
Scott: You got to get rid of.

323
00:23:44,371 --> 00:23:45,278
Rym: Yeah, just let him be there.

324
00:23:45,439 --> 00:23:46,608
Scott: You just let the ads be there.

325
00:23:46,628 --> 00:23:46,790
Scott: yours.

326
00:23:46,911 --> 00:23:47,718
Scott: I time ad block.

327
00:23:47,739 --> 00:23:48,889
Scott: you let ads in your start menu.

328
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:53,290
Rym: Just let him be so my start menu is up for however long it takes to type the name of the application.

329
00:23:53,531 --> 00:23:55,177
Rym: I'm just saying I just didn't even buy.

330
00:23:55,237 --> 00:23:55,538
Rym: remove.

331
00:23:55,598 --> 00:23:58,829
Rym: Are you that simple-minded that it bothers you that much?

332
00:23:59,531 --> 00:24:03,764
Scott: Oh, you're the person who says block all ads ever is now saying it's okay to have ads.

333
00:24:04,145 --> 00:24:08,466
Scott: Yeah in your fucking start menu Yeah, okay, uh-huh are these actually ads?

334
00:24:08,506 --> 00:24:08,949
Rym: though what is?

335
00:24:09,009 --> 00:24:10,214
Scott: yeah Those are actually all ads.

336
00:24:10,274 --> 00:24:14,050
Rym: by the thought that that picture of GeekNights is an ad there's a lot of ads in there.

337
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,356
Rym: I'm just saying that's not an ad.

338
00:24:15,436 --> 00:24:15,617
Scott: there's.

339
00:24:15,637 --> 00:24:17,908
Scott: there are things in there that are not ads but many of them are.

340
00:24:17,948 --> 00:24:19,554
Rym: but more to The point that ms.

341
00:24:19,594 --> 00:24:22,382
Scott: Paint really only is added in the start menu itself.

342
00:24:22,442 --> 00:24:33,697
Rym: because in the era unless you remove them before internet operating systems like a computer with nothing on it had to be Amusing and reasonably functional.

343
00:24:33,818 --> 00:24:36,830
Rym: even if you never ever put a disk in it installed software.

344
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:37,336
Scott: No internet.

345
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,101
Scott: Where would you go and get software from?

346
00:24:40,201 --> 00:24:41,329
Scott: you had to go to the store and buy?

347
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:42,152
Scott: Software.

348
00:24:42,392 --> 00:24:50,180
Scott: and if you bought a computer and you just set it up and you turned it on if it didn't do anything useful It's like it's like an old Apple computer.

349
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,890
Scott: You got to put it in a program, right?

350
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,034
Scott: It's like what.

351
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:59,335
Rym: but like people would like you needed a bunch of games in a computer because an average family most family members We have no reason to use a computer.

352
00:24:59,817 --> 00:25:04,368
Rym: So you pretty much needed to have amusements built in but nowadays We don't need that.

353
00:25:04,791 --> 00:25:06,176
Rym: But you do need some other things.

354
00:25:06,257 --> 00:25:08,806
Rym: like you still need a web browser to come with the OS.

355
00:25:08,827 --> 00:25:10,915
Rym: it makes sense for a web Browser to get built in.

356
00:25:11,216 --> 00:25:14,530
Scott: it should be Chrome or it should turn on and let you choose which one you want.

357
00:25:15,091 --> 00:25:22,370
Scott: You know rather than including IE that you use actually Windows today comes with fucking two web browsers edge and Internet Explorer.

358
00:25:22,611 --> 00:25:23,615
Scott: Jesus fucking Christ.

359
00:25:24,277 --> 00:25:25,562
Rym: that doesn't really bother me though.

360
00:25:25,703 --> 00:25:27,590
Scott: It doesn't bother me, but it's like are you serious?

361
00:25:28,571 --> 00:25:29,898
Scott: Remember really now?

362
00:25:29,918 --> 00:25:32,030
Scott: and you're just using one of them to install Chrome.

363
00:25:32,231 --> 00:25:35,470
Scott: So for a normal person actually Firefox has improved a lot.

364
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:45,323
Rym: 90% of what they do on a computer is a browser recently like the past few weeks and the other 10% of it is some sort of like email app and For gamers, it's like steam 20%.

365
00:25:45,323 --> 00:25:47,918
Rym: steam 70% browser 10%.

366
00:25:47,918 --> 00:25:52,965
Scott: me when you guys seem in Chrome like you're done Yeah, what else you need unless you actually do things with your computer.

367
00:25:52,985 --> 00:25:55,979
Rym: I mean, I got audition running Some people have Adobe stuff.

368
00:25:56,019 --> 00:25:58,349
Scott: Yeah, I got OBS running over there.

369
00:26:00,054 --> 00:26:04,926
Rym: But yeah, people are shockingly mad about this and I find that really fun.

370
00:26:04,966 --> 00:26:06,350
Scott: We'll get mad about fucking everything.

371
00:26:06,491 --> 00:26:07,635
Scott: That's how they do every time.

372
00:26:07,675 --> 00:26:11,870
Scott: people get mad about some software changing like Twitter redesigned ravel ravel ravel.

373
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:13,376
Scott: This did it ravel ravel ravel.

374
00:26:13,396 --> 00:26:15,524
Scott: and I go lol get with the program.

375
00:26:15,564 --> 00:26:18,821
Scott: life is things are gonna change Constantly for the rest of your life.

376
00:26:19,103 --> 00:26:22,981
Scott: if you're gonna ravel every time Just die already like why.

377
00:26:23,142 --> 00:26:30,807
Rym: so another really quick news here Snopes the website that long ago told us whether or not there was rat meat in our chicken nuggets.

378
00:26:30,847 --> 00:26:33,021
Rym: if we were too stupid to Just assume there isn't.

379
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:37,090
Rym: mm-hmm Appears to be in trouble, but it could be fake.

380
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:40,726
Scott: I need Snopes to tell me if it's not fake or not, but where would we check?

381
00:26:40,846 --> 00:26:41,529
Rym: How do we know?

382
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:43,415
Scott: Snopes is still up right now.

383
00:26:43,516 --> 00:26:44,441
Rym: Yeah, you can read this.

384
00:26:44,461 --> 00:26:47,113
Rym: I'm not not gonna we're not news We're commentary.

385
00:26:47,695 --> 00:26:52,291
Rym: my hot take is that I I don't think nopes does not have good I.

386
00:26:52,372 --> 00:26:59,621
Scott: if this is true and it is a hundred percent the people at Snopes are Morons when it comes to fucking computers, we should look at other website.

387
00:26:59,661 --> 00:27:00,765
Rym: looks you have you like that.

388
00:27:00,805 --> 00:27:02,170
Scott: might you have no business?

389
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:03,781
Scott: running such an important website?

390
00:27:03,841 --> 00:27:10,993
Scott: if you don't if you just Let basically pay someone to take care of all your computer stuff if they lost their DNS Like.

391
00:27:11,194 --> 00:27:14,450
Scott: I really need Snopes to continue to exist because it's an important resource.

392
00:27:14,891 --> 00:27:20,550
Scott: But I have no sympathy for the people who own it losing their livelihood if they fuck up because they fucked up.

393
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:25,610
Rym: But if they're in so much trouble, how are they about like the people who run their website holding them hostage?

394
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:31,910
Rym: How have they been able to put the save Snopes banner to donate on Snopes because they still have access to like the admin of?

395
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:34,892
Scott: Snopes, you know in the CMS Yeah But they don't have.

396
00:27:35,233 --> 00:27:41,090
Scott: it seems like they either don't know or don't like have access to like the DNS the actual servers.

397
00:27:41,552 --> 00:27:45,767
Scott: You know the anything like that, so they can't actually like, you know do any.

398
00:27:45,807 --> 00:27:46,730
Rym: so I got a guess.

399
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:49,690
Rym: This is an uninformed pure guess on my part.

400
00:27:49,951 --> 00:27:59,870
Rym: I suspect that they are dumb and they did the penny arcade of Accidentally sold their company or accidentally gave someone else rights and that is the real problem here.

401
00:28:00,071 --> 00:28:10,550
Rym: I'm sure I feel like the people who run their website own part of like own the IP in some way to where They are being extorted and it's kind of their own fault.

402
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:17,742
Scott: I mean if that's a guess doesn't know I mean I Do know is that I don't know anything about the legal aspect or who owns what.

403
00:28:17,802 --> 00:28:31,610
Scott: but the point is if you don't know enough About technology and you have valuable technology people who do know about technology can hold you ransom Yep, and it is not really much you can do about it even with legal resource because they just delete all your shit.

404
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:31,933
Scott: Then what?

405
00:28:32,357 --> 00:28:35,689
Scott: Yeah, you've got a Law can't bring back the data.

406
00:28:35,972 --> 00:28:40,202
Rym: You gotta hire someone who knows what they're doing But you don't know how to vet the person right.

407
00:28:40,282 --> 00:28:43,679
Scott: what they should do is they should Start by backing up their shit.

408
00:28:43,699 --> 00:28:45,710
Scott: And if they don't have backups, they should scrape that shit.

409
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:48,023
Scott: Yeah, and then just try to save your DNS.

410
00:28:48,063 --> 00:28:53,790
Scott: if you control your DNS record You can just point it in new fucking servers and you don't need to worry about your hosting company there.

411
00:28:53,971 --> 00:29:01,544
Rym: Just stop paying them, but I feel like if we ever find out what happened back there I imagine it's a really pathetic drama mess.

412
00:29:01,966 --> 00:29:11,403
Scott: just from reading this I can tell you the people at Snopes are not not guilty or not not negligence Yep, and now we're not giving them any money.

413
00:29:11,463 --> 00:29:14,717
Rym: We're not saying that the people Allegedly holding them hostage.

414
00:29:14,817 --> 00:29:16,162
Rym: They might also they might be evil.

415
00:29:16,282 --> 00:29:18,310
Scott: Oh, yeah, but I'm still not giving confident.

416
00:29:18,492 --> 00:29:20,410
Scott: Yes, but I'm not giving any money to incompetent.

417
00:29:21,032 --> 00:29:22,336
Rym: I'd say let's just make Snopes.

418
00:29:22,396 --> 00:29:27,836
Scott: and the problem is the value of Snopes is important enough that someone as soon as this message went Up someone has already scraped it.

419
00:29:27,896 --> 00:29:30,206
Scott: So I am and not worried at all about losing the.

420
00:29:31,491 --> 00:29:32,033
Scott: The Snopes with.

421
00:29:32,053 --> 00:29:37,770
Rym: the value of Snopes is primarily in the investigative journalism and the data not the name or anything else.

422
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:38,895
Rym: right this point exactly.

423
00:29:38,976 --> 00:29:44,402
Scott: so they could even just start up a new site Snopes - and As long as it's all their trademark then it.

424
00:29:44,462 --> 00:29:47,575
Scott: then they can call it Sin seppone or something.

425
00:29:47,595 --> 00:29:52,770
Scott: Yep, and just host all their recaptured data that they probably you know, and whatever.

426
00:29:53,071 --> 00:29:54,316
Rym: So we'll see where this goes.

427
00:29:54,337 --> 00:29:57,310
Rym: I am NOT donating money until I know what's going on.

428
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,079
Rym: Yes, much as I like Snopes I do not trust.

429
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:01,785
Scott: donate your money to the Internet Archive.

430
00:30:01,825 --> 00:30:03,110
Scott: instead who will archive Snopes?

431
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:06,080
Scott: Yeah, and knows about and they know about computers very much.

432
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,910
Scott: They are talented IT professionals at the Internet Archive.

433
00:30:09,131 --> 00:30:13,850
Rym: So this is your news even though you've asked me four times today what your own news is.

434
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:14,612
Scott: Yeah, I guess I forget.

435
00:30:14,673 --> 00:30:15,857
Scott: so check this out.

436
00:30:15,917 --> 00:30:18,686
Scott: This is some VC garbage startup.

437
00:30:18,746 --> 00:30:21,802
Scott: Somewhere is making like They're making some bullshit.

438
00:30:21,822 --> 00:30:22,570
Scott: That's not gonna work.

439
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:25,443
Scott: You know typical Silicon Valley nonsense get but what.

440
00:30:25,483 --> 00:30:31,610
Rym: but the what they're doing is Because the kind of thing that could undermine open source consumer software.

441
00:30:31,751 --> 00:30:35,730
Scott: They have this technique that that they are using to which market their shit.

442
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:37,695
Scott: I'm not gonna say their name because it would market them.

443
00:30:38,096 --> 00:30:46,530
Scott: So what they're doing is step one hire someone who is The maintainer of a popular open source thing.

444
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:57,610
Scott: For example, they hired someone who is the manager of a plug-in for the atom text editor Which is the text editor that's made by github, I believe and is a very popular text editor.

445
00:30:57,851 --> 00:31:10,890
Scott: So they hired someone who made a very popular plug-in for Adam and then in hiring this person They I guess they couldn't force them to do it But I guess the person did it of their own free will possibly because a bunch of money showed up who knows.

446
00:31:11,272 --> 00:31:25,619
Scott: but this person worked for this startup and Then as after they were hired by the startup They merged in a patch into this plug-in that effectively added what amounts to Advertising for the startup they now work for.

447
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:28,588
Scott: that would be like if I merge some.

448
00:31:28,849 --> 00:31:29,689
Scott: you know I was working.

449
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:38,190
Rym: I don't know you were gonna patchy and you merge like you just merge in all these like ads for GeekNights into the comments Of all those modules and scripts, right?

450
00:31:38,291 --> 00:31:39,758
Scott: It's like that's basically what they did.

451
00:31:39,778 --> 00:31:42,070
Scott: the details of this happened.

452
00:31:42,171 --> 00:31:52,610
Scott: At least there's at least two recorded incidents of this and perhaps more Because they only have so many employees right and those employees only have so many existing popular open source projects in their portfolios.

453
00:31:53,491 --> 00:32:03,101
Scott: but Yeah That basically means people are just innocently using this open source project not realizing the person who maintains It was hired by an evil company and modified it.

454
00:32:03,381 --> 00:32:05,830
Scott: and now when they update they get this evil update.

455
00:32:07,152 --> 00:32:18,875
Scott: So yeah now people who actually care about these projects have to go and like fork them Because depending on the license and remove these evil patches and also find people to now be the maintainers because the original maintainer is in The pay of the evil people.

456
00:32:19,055 --> 00:32:26,530
Scott: exactly so and that maintainer you can't trust any software They make ever because they're a person they basically ethics they Lenovo'd at that point.

457
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:34,101
Scott: Yeah, that person anything that that person works on ever even after this startup goes out of business, which it will Is now a tainted person?

458
00:32:34,222 --> 00:32:34,766
Rym: No, they're doing.

459
00:32:34,806 --> 00:32:35,330
Rym: I trust them.

460
00:32:35,711 --> 00:32:39,424
Rym: It seems like their plan is to do this as far and wide as possible.

461
00:32:39,886 --> 00:32:52,581
Rym: and from a cynical perspective I mean, it's clever because the kinds of people who maintain like these types of open source projects often need the money It's and their salary is way cheaper than legitimate advertise.

462
00:32:52,642 --> 00:32:55,490
Scott: It's a clever technique to market, right?

463
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:55,992
Scott: It's like who?

464
00:32:56,012 --> 00:32:56,835
Scott: I wouldn't have thought of that.

465
00:32:56,936 --> 00:33:00,250
Scott: but your market you're making tools for developers.

466
00:33:00,793 --> 00:33:02,360
Scott: Right who are the smart people?

467
00:33:02,541 --> 00:33:04,430
Scott: and now you're burning the bridge with the customer.

468
00:33:04,892 --> 00:33:10,787
Scott: But it would be smart if you could use this kind of technique to like Let's say you hired the people who work on VLC.

469
00:33:11,371 --> 00:33:13,838
Rym: I was about to say name into the stuff that normal people.

470
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,045
Scott: Yeah, then the people using VLC.

471
00:33:16,105 --> 00:33:17,610
Scott: Well don't know any better, right?

472
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:22,361
Scott: It's like oh, there's an ad in VLC now god damn Oh, well, right smart people will stop.

473
00:33:22,401 --> 00:33:24,370
Scott: but most of the people using a VLC don't know better.

474
00:33:24,691 --> 00:33:33,890
Scott: But if you're going for dev tools like the atom text editor or the Python auto-complete Which they also now people who said that shit up for developers, you know better, you know fooling them.

475
00:33:34,451 --> 00:33:52,689
Rym: But it does show a very a power a profound weakness in the open source movement as a whole in that Some projects are important enough to the fundamental fabric of technology and the modern world Like the Linux kernel that there is in that there is plenty of money and funding and people to keep it going.

476
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:57,969
Scott: Well, also is these kinds of also projects that are large enough like that aren't you know?

477
00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:59,540
Scott: Linchpin on a single person.

478
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:04,965
Scott: even if Linus Torvalds dies Or Greg koa Hartman dies or turns evil, right?

479
00:34:05,527 --> 00:34:07,836
Scott: It won't affect Linux They will just kick that person out.

480
00:34:08,076 --> 00:34:16,469
Scott: even Linus Torvalds can be kicked out of Linux if he does if he fucks up too much Right, but imagine like so some really important Apache module or some bright work.

481
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:16,751
Scott: It's.

482
00:34:17,053 --> 00:34:26,730
Scott: the vulnerability is in projects that have a lar Relatively large number of users and a relatively small number of maintainers which could even be one maintainer.

483
00:34:27,292 --> 00:34:36,869
Scott: And then that person that single person becomes compromised in some way and is now, you know they're deploying software onto all these people's computers around the world the thousands of developers and

484
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:42,405
Rym: It would also be a great way to start sneaking malware in if you were a bad person.

485
00:34:42,465 --> 00:34:50,850
Rym: because the reality is Most people who download open-source software download binaries and run them without thinking about it or a lot of people do curl pipe.

486
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:56,984
Rym: Exact I mean even if you compile it, did you actually step through the code?

487
00:34:57,085 --> 00:34:58,148
Rym: No, you'd of course you didn't.

488
00:34:58,268 --> 00:34:58,850
Scott: no one does.

489
00:34:59,051 --> 00:35:09,529
Scott: Yeah, you can make a Python module and put it on pi pi and if someone pip installs it You can make a node module put it on NPM Installs it you can make a deb and to put it up somewhere and someone can apt install it.

490
00:35:09,549 --> 00:35:12,749
Scott: and If they don't look before they install you got them.

491
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:14,397
Rym: But the weakness to installing.

492
00:35:14,417 --> 00:35:14,798
Scott: these are the

493
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:24,057
Rym: kinds of projects where you know The economy's not great and it doesn't look like it's getting better for the average person which you know Obviously, especially

494
00:35:24,118 --> 00:35:26,978
Scott: someone who's writing software in their spare time for free meaning

495
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:37,022
Rym: that there's a lot of economic pressure on people who maintain these projects to either quit maintaining them to get a job that pays food money or To take money from this evil company.

496
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:37,484
Rym: Mm-hmm.

497
00:35:37,846 --> 00:35:52,880
Rym: So We'll see how quickly this blows up in this terrible company's face And we'll see if there becomes a trend of other people trying to Ransom hostage or otherwise compromise open-source software.

498
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:57,315
Scott: This company will live as long as it's VC funding keeps it alive And then that'll be it.

499
00:35:57,456 --> 00:36:02,347
Rym: Yeah, just like all other startups I definitely do want to keep tabs on whoever funded this.

500
00:36:02,669 --> 00:36:12,290
Scott: and The point what you should do is look at all the open-source software you use that's actually somewhat important and Go and if it's not a major project, you don't worry about vim, right?

501
00:36:13,072 --> 00:36:16,001
Scott: Right, but it's yeah some plug-in you're using or something.

502
00:36:16,022 --> 00:36:17,887
Scott: All right, go and check.

503
00:36:18,068 --> 00:36:18,670
Scott: Well, you know what?

504
00:36:20,452 --> 00:36:26,662
Rym: What the deal is with it, like I use the hell out of notepad plus plus to this day, that's fine You can trust that right pretty sure I can.

505
00:36:26,823 --> 00:36:27,508
Scott: yeah, you can trust it.

506
00:36:28,372 --> 00:36:33,090
Scott: But like for now, you know check the I guess heritage what you know, the what's the word?

507
00:36:34,211 --> 00:36:34,856
Scott: I don't know.

508
00:36:35,037 --> 00:36:39,395
Scott: There's a word for there ends an edge For the provenance.

509
00:36:39,515 --> 00:36:41,663
Scott: check the provenance of yours not an edge.

510
00:36:41,723 --> 00:36:42,726
Rym: That's not the proven edge.

511
00:36:43,047 --> 00:36:43,609
Scott: No, it's not.

512
00:36:44,651 --> 00:36:50,130
Scott: You should know the provenance of all of the the little things that you're installing for free to make sure they're legit.

513
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:52,121
Scott: Just check them all once and well and then once.

514
00:36:52,181 --> 00:36:57,510
Scott: if you check everything you use now once Then you can now easily check everything you add in the future.

515
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:59,920
Rym: Another thing is well if you work for a company, this is more important.

516
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:07,148
Rym: if you are a company that uses open source software Someone's job should be to periodically vet the open source packages.

517
00:37:07,168 --> 00:37:10,464
Scott: You're using Yeah every time and then don't update them without checking again.

518
00:37:10,484 --> 00:37:16,850
Scott: Yeah, also Another general rule that I follow a lot of people don't is just minimize how much stuff you use.

519
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:29,447
Scott: I see people they got like, you know a million fucking plugins in their vim and the firefox and all these add-ons and it's like I use as few as humanly possible just Because you you know, you you keep your attack surface area down.

520
00:37:29,467 --> 00:37:37,106
Rym: Yeah But anyway things of the day.

521
00:37:37,186 --> 00:37:49,551
Rym: so in case I didn't drag Pokemon go fest enough from a like poor planning perspective this video is a super cut of how bad Pokemon go fast really was.

522
00:37:49,571 --> 00:38:09,535
Rym: it's someone just took actual promotional video that was filmed at Pokemon go fast and it's great because you see these MC's who are clearly professionals trying to Not react to the crowd as a crowd of 10,000 people is chanting things like we can't play and Kind of losing their shit.

523
00:38:10,905 --> 00:38:26,113
Rym: It also interestingly really highlights how bad an idea Pokemon go fest as a Like as a concept was because of how non interactive the game actually is Mm-hmm the fest like you.

524
00:38:26,173 --> 00:38:29,640
Rym: if you watch this video You'll see the kinds of events and the kinds of things they're doing.

525
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:37,663
Rym: There's no content you can provide to people at an event like this other than like a place to hang out with the other people Who do the thing?

526
00:38:38,045 --> 00:38:40,940
Rym: because the game is not actually interactive in any meaningful way.

527
00:38:41,232 --> 00:38:50,320
Rym: No and You see that by how desperately they had to stretch The kinds of events that they put on at the event and then had to fake the fact that none of the events actually worked.

528
00:38:50,944 --> 00:39:00,848
Rym: Mm-hmm, but to their credit these people Super pro emcees like remember when he fucked up that late show and there's that moment where the two of us look at each other For a second because we don't know what to do.

529
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:02,374
Rym: That never happens.

530
00:39:02,695 --> 00:39:15,756
Rym: They like power through it to the end bonus points for the fact that they keep trying to coin all this like pro gamer terminology around Pokemon go a Game that has literally zero skill input.

531
00:39:15,997 --> 00:39:17,404
Rym: Mm-hmm they they have these cut.

532
00:39:17,424 --> 00:39:26,254
Rym: they kept these phrases like savage season, which is a Technique you can use to one shot a Pokemon and it's literally made up bullshit.

533
00:39:26,595 --> 00:39:30,587
Rym: and this one guy is like Committed to acting like.

534
00:39:30,648 --> 00:39:33,557
Rym: this is a thing real people say in the real world.

535
00:39:33,577 --> 00:39:36,712
Rym: Mm-hmm It's just fascinating to watch this.

536
00:39:36,792 --> 00:39:40,227
Scott: I mean shit like this isn't new Yeah, but this video is pretty.

537
00:39:40,247 --> 00:39:43,740
Rym: this video is a lot like all those long shots of the ball pit at.

538
00:39:44,123 --> 00:39:46,099
Scott: I got an actual technology thing of a day here.

539
00:39:46,561 --> 00:39:49,209
Scott: So the first RAM today.

540
00:39:49,249 --> 00:39:50,794
Scott: people don't know how RAM today works.

541
00:39:50,914 --> 00:39:52,920
Scott: RAM today at least as far as I'm aware.

542
00:39:53,041 --> 00:39:55,460
Scott: Maybe things have changed since I learned about how RAM works.

543
00:39:55,641 --> 00:40:01,399
Scott: But as far as I know SD RAM that we were using like DDR one It's still the same principle just way way way better.

544
00:40:02,002 --> 00:40:14,355
Scott: It's basically sort of a really fancy circuit breaker with really tiny tiny break Yeah, and then you basically just like the circuit breaker in your basement Imagine just like a bajillion fucking tiny switches now go click click click.

545
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:20,816
Scott: They're electronic obviously with no moving parts But and back in the day the first ever RAM right?

546
00:40:20,936 --> 00:40:22,080
Scott: How the fuck did it work?

547
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,328
Scott: We had vacuum tubes.

548
00:40:23,751 --> 00:40:24,900
Scott: that wasn't really RAM.

549
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,116
Scott: That was the transistors of the vacuum tubes and the computer would just compute.

550
00:40:29,136 --> 00:40:30,320
Scott: you had the input and the output.

551
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:33,436
Scott: There wasn't a lot of storage besides a flip-flop, right?

552
00:40:33,456 --> 00:40:35,044
Scott: Which is a register That's not RAM.

553
00:40:35,184 --> 00:40:45,140
Scott: RAM is like an a memory that is external to the CPU That is addressed by the CPU and read to and written from written to and read from right?

554
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:47,930
Scott: Not a register that the CPU is using to compute.

555
00:40:48,472 --> 00:40:54,439
Scott: the first ever RAM ever Was not the fancy circuit breaker DDR kind we have now.

556
00:40:55,606 --> 00:41:04,800
Scott: It was this thing called core memory Which if you look there's a million videos about this like you can make it yourself Right memory or memory plane and you can make some yourself.

557
00:41:04,901 --> 00:41:37,555
Scott: The way it works is you basically sew with thread Strings a mesh and on the vertices of the mesh are little donut Magnets tiny magnets that are donut shaped and you send electricity through, you know the edges right a lot of the you know, the on the side through these strings and The when you know, you hit certain vertices with the electricity the donuts physically flip around like And from some of the side you can write and some of the side you can read.

558
00:41:37,575 --> 00:41:50,240
Scott: you can flip the donuts and you can read which way the donuts are currently flipped by, you know, seeing what comes out and it was The thing is it was prone to error because physical donut things moving around.

559
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:58,655
Scott: So it was lots and lots of error correction going on to avoid that and sometimes the computer would crash if those error and you had to start over.

560
00:41:59,036 --> 00:42:03,178
Scott: but you know It wasn't nearly as bad as it was before the invention of this stuff.

561
00:42:03,801 --> 00:42:08,640
Rym: So core memory was extra fascinating because the way you actually made it there were never hand.

562
00:42:08,867 --> 00:42:12,388
Rym: Well, yeah Because there were never efficient machines to make it.

563
00:42:12,809 --> 00:42:21,800
Rym: and lots of people like in the fin during the Cold War like the early 50s their job was to basically knit RAM to using computers, right?

564
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:26,300
Scott: So here's a video with a guy who worked on the team that made the RAM talking all about it.

565
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:30,356
Scott: It's fucking fascinating and he has the RAM and he can show it to you and it still works today.

566
00:42:30,637 --> 00:42:31,440
Scott: Just slow as balls.

567
00:42:31,621 --> 00:42:40,203
Scott: Yeah slower than your hard drive with moving discs in it Probably slower than like a 1.44 floppy drive Really slow.

568
00:42:40,644 --> 00:42:44,214
Rym: so in about a moment the book club book was Dune Frank Herbert's.

569
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:45,898
Rym: we finished it the episodes up.

570
00:42:46,119 --> 00:42:47,747
Rym: go listen Enjoy, we talked about Dune.

571
00:42:47,767 --> 00:42:49,014
Scott: We're probably gonna watch the Dune movie.

572
00:42:49,034 --> 00:42:50,060
Scott: That's supposed to be hella bad.

573
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,627
Rym: Yeah, we're gonna watch the Dune movie and then you it.

574
00:42:52,667 --> 00:43:04,578
Scott: yeah, and then I guess the new book club book is the fifth season Not C's own season right as in a season like spring winter summer fall and then a fifth season after that.

575
00:43:04,678 --> 00:43:06,884
Scott: Oh my god Stupid smarch.

576
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:08,430
Scott: Yeah, that's a month.

577
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:09,214
Scott: That's not a season.

578
00:43:09,977 --> 00:43:19,907
Scott: This would be like Falter By NK Jemisin.

579
00:43:19,947 --> 00:43:24,547
Scott: this book is like the hot shit in the sci-fi fantasy Genres of recent years.

580
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:26,655
Scott: all her books are but this is like.

581
00:43:26,755 --> 00:43:29,708
Scott: that seems to be the main Starting point for this author.

582
00:43:29,728 --> 00:43:30,512
Scott: So that's where we going.

583
00:43:30,833 --> 00:43:31,034
Rym: Yep.

584
00:43:31,074 --> 00:43:32,220
Rym: You can see I already bought it.

585
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:33,608
Rym: I bought it when Scott announced it.

586
00:43:33,869 --> 00:43:38,286
Rym: He has to update the website and we'll do it Probably after the prince of nothing book comes out.

587
00:43:38,828 --> 00:43:41,676
Scott: Yeah, cuz prince of nothing is gonna come out in tomorrow.

588
00:43:41,897 --> 00:43:46,656
Scott: Yep, supposedly Yeah, and we're gonna read that and then we're gonna start reading this book club book.

589
00:43:46,897 --> 00:43:51,495
Scott: Yeah Otherwise, are you starting the book club book in like three days proud?

590
00:43:51,636 --> 00:43:52,299
Rym: Yeah, something like that.

591
00:43:52,842 --> 00:43:53,826
Rym: I'm pretty much gonna read the prison.

592
00:43:53,866 --> 00:43:57,240
Rym: nothing like probably before that bike ride like on the train up.

593
00:43:57,461 --> 00:43:59,336
Scott: I'm gonna read it in the tent while I'm waiting for the bike.

594
00:43:59,376 --> 00:44:01,400
Rym: Yeah So, yeah.

595
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:14,460
Rym: Otherwise, I'd like Scott's YouTube channel as a ton of stuff and my youtube channel has a ton of stuff and together They're like the entire cannon of GeekNights video Except for a few videos that are orphaned on an account that for complicated reasons We can't access anymore.

596
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:18,777
Rym: But I'm just gonna scrape them all out and stick them on my youtube channel just so I can control them.

597
00:44:18,797 --> 00:44:26,862
Rym: Hmm and yeah, otherwise the next convention we're gonna be at is Pax West the real Pax.

598
00:44:26,883 --> 00:44:30,300
Scott: the tickets are in that my friend just got his tickets in the mail.

599
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:32,708
Scott: Mine might be in my mailbox right the fuck now.

600
00:44:32,728 --> 00:44:34,394
Rym: I booked my flights today.

601
00:44:34,414 --> 00:44:36,320
Scott: Oh, I booked him while ago.

602
00:44:36,421 --> 00:44:38,560
Rym: Yeah, you know what Delta was actually cheaper than jet blue.

603
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:42,140
Scott: I feel like I've been booking flights too early and I could save money by booking later.

604
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:43,325
Scott: So I'm gonna start booking later.

605
00:44:43,646 --> 00:44:44,971
Scott: I'm waiting for the PAX South flights.

606
00:44:45,031 --> 00:44:45,614
Scott: I didn't book him yet.

607
00:44:45,694 --> 00:44:47,200
Rym: Probably PAX South is way too soon.

608
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,003
Scott: Yeah, I'm gonna wait.

609
00:44:48,184 --> 00:44:51,700
Rym: I read you is for domestic flights two months for international flights three months.

610
00:44:52,364 --> 00:44:53,852
Scott: I read a few things online.

611
00:44:53,872 --> 00:44:57,569
Scott: I couldn't tell if they were true or not But I figured there's no reason not to at least give them a shot.

612
00:44:57,830 --> 00:45:00,480
Scott: They said 47 days is the ideal time.

613
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,970
Scott: So 47 days before PAX South.

614
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:07,712
Scott: I'm gonna go try to buy tickets and see that prices I mean, I said alert if they're higher than they were before.

615
00:45:07,732 --> 00:45:10,699
Scott: Oh, well, and if they're lower, oh, okay I guess they weren't lying to me.

616
00:45:10,901 --> 00:45:13,900
Rym: I actually do use kayak mostly because I found that at least for a while.

617
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:14,282
Rym: I mean, I can't.

618
00:45:14,322 --> 00:45:23,106
Rym: I'm not saying I endorse them and you know those kinds of sites come and go all the time But right now they're the ones I use because I booked a lot of flights And I had pretty good luck with them.

619
00:45:23,186 --> 00:45:27,400
Rym: Like they've never overcharged me and I pretty much always find the best option.

620
00:45:27,521 --> 00:45:28,204
Scott: I've used it before.

621
00:45:28,425 --> 00:45:31,620
Scott: Yeah, in fact, it's a little janky the way it works, but it works.

622
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:36,042
Rym: Well, the problem is I always have to uncheck EWR cuz I'm not flying out of Newark Fuck you.

623
00:45:36,102 --> 00:45:41,318
Rym: Yep, and I have to uncheck like Gatwick cuz I'm not flying to Gatwick if I'm going to London.

624
00:45:41,358 --> 00:45:41,740
Rym: Fuck you.

625
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:46,820
Scott: Well, I mean actually, you know if the flight is like serious enough flight and you're saving enough money?

626
00:45:47,845 --> 00:45:49,975
Scott: Never true you can get to EWR not too bad.

627
00:45:51,121 --> 00:45:55,279
Rym: I would have to save at least five hundred dollars before I would even consider going to EWR.

628
00:45:56,144 --> 00:45:58,599
Scott: No, cuz it doesn't cost five hundred dollars to get there back.

629
00:45:59,801 --> 00:46:01,065
Scott: Get to get to Newark.

630
00:46:01,386 --> 00:46:04,296
Scott: It only costs like an hour of your time an hour.

631
00:46:04,356 --> 00:46:05,520
Rym: if there's minimal traffic.

632
00:46:05,722 --> 00:46:06,107
Scott: I know.

633
00:46:06,147 --> 00:46:07,260
Scott: what do you do that my traffic?

634
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:14,213
Rym: Well the last time I Jersey Transit goes there and all at 24 hours a day Jersey Transit The last time I flew to Newark for a work trip.

635
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:17,897
Rym: I took a cab actually Fucking cab because the company just set it up.

636
00:46:17,917 --> 00:46:20,570
Scott: for now You can take Jersey Transit to get to Newark 24/7.

637
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:22,960
Scott: So no matter when your flight is you can get there.

638
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,620
Rym: Also Penn Station so much right now.

639
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:27,612
Scott: I wouldn't trust that because like it depends when your flight is right.

640
00:46:27,632 --> 00:46:30,383
Scott: if your flight involves a rush hour trip Maybe not.

641
00:46:30,403 --> 00:46:34,200
Scott: but if your flight is like oh get to eat get to Newark early crack of dawn on Saturday.

642
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:36,510
Rym: It's also just like the times I flown there.

643
00:46:36,571 --> 00:46:37,254
Rym: It just kind of sucks.

644
00:46:37,274 --> 00:46:38,640
Rym: I mean, it's not as bad as LaGuardia.

645
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:39,342
Rym: Don't get me wrong.

646
00:46:39,443 --> 00:46:44,320
Scott: No, but already is the guard is the worst but at least I can basically walk there.

647
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,025
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

648
00:46:45,227 --> 00:46:46,536
Scott: well, I guess okay.

649
00:46:46,556 --> 00:46:47,677
Scott: I'll go here occasionally.

650
00:46:48,620 --> 00:47:02,060
Rym: Third sixty six percent of the time that I have landed at LaGuardia in the last year I have walked out of the airport because transit was fucked and there was no other way out Mmm, and I feel real bad for people who don't have that luxury.

651
00:47:03,502 --> 00:47:04,727
Rym: And actually it's a pretty nice walk.

652
00:47:04,767 --> 00:47:08,825
Rym: like you walk out of LaGuardia and eventually you get on like, you know There's a couple streets.

653
00:47:08,845 --> 00:47:09,268
Rym: You can take.

654
00:47:09,549 --> 00:47:14,320
Scott: I take toward my home when I've landed LaGuardia Usually take a cab home and I've been lucky that that has worked.

655
00:47:14,521 --> 00:47:15,927
Rym: Yeah, two of the times I landed there.

656
00:47:16,047 --> 00:47:16,489
Scott: I have.

657
00:47:16,569 --> 00:47:19,060
Scott: I have now learned how to use the select bus service.

658
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:19,744
Scott: I'm gonna try it.

659
00:47:20,106 --> 00:47:21,414
Rym: Yeah, the one time I had trouble there.

660
00:47:21,454 --> 00:47:23,920
Rym: The traffic was so bad The select bus couldn't get into the airport.

661
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:30,592
Rym: I learned how to use like busing so I walked out and I caught the local bus that does kind of the same route from outside the airport.

662
00:47:30,733 --> 00:47:32,899
Rym: Hmm So, uh, yeah.

663
00:47:34,061 --> 00:47:35,588
Rym: So this topic I think is worth.

664
00:47:35,910 --> 00:47:38,120
Scott: I feel like we've talked about this so many times.

665
00:47:38,221 --> 00:47:41,779
Scott: It feels like either in news bits and also we did an episode on it.

666
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:48,096
Scott: He's already said everything we got to say but but it's important enough that we could say some more.

667
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:53,260
Rym: also some like some things have legit changed in this topic in the last year like there is.

668
00:47:54,041 --> 00:48:01,147
Rym: There are changes to best practices regarding passwords and the last show we did where we definitely talked about This is the main topic was

669
00:48:01,207 --> 00:48:03,079
Scott: two years ago, which is not that long ago

670
00:48:03,401 --> 00:48:06,633
Rym: But we called it don't share your password and I'm

671
00:48:06,753 --> 00:48:10,742
Scott: sure that in the discussion of passwords We said everything there is to say about pass But I think

672
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:18,360
Rym: I feel like we mostly talked about all the people who like have they share Passwords with each other which and I think that is a really common practice now

673
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,143
Scott: Do not

674
00:48:19,163 --> 00:48:20,388
Rym: do all the streaming services

675
00:48:20,529 --> 00:48:21,553
Scott: never do

676
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:24,425
Rym: even though as I say that For a long time.

677
00:48:24,465 --> 00:48:32,935
Rym: We were logging into Emily's parents crunchyroll account because yeah, they shared their password But I just have my own account now because I didn't know that that was not maintainable.

678
00:48:32,955 --> 00:48:34,280
Rym: that a lot of reasons.

679
00:48:34,842 --> 00:48:46,280
Rym: But obviously don't share your passwords don't make your password hunter - but NIST Which is an organization you can the national different standards and technology or something something like that.

680
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:50,540
Rym: Yeah, they issue guidance for things is a good way to describe them.

681
00:48:50,645 --> 00:48:58,060
Rym: Yeah Technology and science things and they've changed a lot of the best practices around how you should manage passwords.

682
00:48:58,181 --> 00:49:04,393
Rym: So I think we should do a quick refresh on in 2017. how should you deal with your passwords?

683
00:49:04,694 --> 00:49:05,860
Rym: and the answer is not?

684
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:11,720
Rym: To use a service where you give them your passwords and then they log into your sites for you All right.

685
00:49:11,805 --> 00:49:17,537
Scott: well To give people credit using one of those services like last pass or one pass or whatever.

686
00:49:17,577 --> 00:49:20,677
Rym: those fucking things are Last pass might be the safest one.

687
00:49:20,738 --> 00:49:30,920
Scott: I don't know I don't know which one's good and which one's bad because I don't use any of that garbage, but They're better than the regular whatever, you know, they're better than like doing nothing and doing some crap.

688
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:34,952
Rym: Yeah, if you're bad at passwords, definitely use something like last pass.

689
00:49:35,052 --> 00:49:37,860
Rym: It's way safer than whatever garbage you're doing now, right?

690
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:39,606
Scott: It's like it's got its problems.

691
00:49:39,626 --> 00:49:43,440
Scott: I wouldn't trust it, but it's like for your mom.

692
00:49:43,722 --> 00:49:49,225
Scott: It's like if your mom is just gonna like make her password like the name of the pet With like a number after it.

693
00:49:49,345 --> 00:49:52,155
Scott: Yeah, then your mom would be helped by last pass.

694
00:49:52,255 --> 00:49:53,560
Scott: It's still better than that.

695
00:49:54,106 --> 00:50:03,333
Scott: So, okay But otherwise if you actually have anything you care about protecting for real Like your steam account that has thousands of dollars with the games in it.

696
00:50:03,433 --> 00:50:03,714
Scott: Yep.

697
00:50:04,257 --> 00:50:05,080
Scott: Do not use this.

698
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:10,136
Rym: Oh god YouTube in the background is just looping terrifying stew letters animatronics on this tab.

699
00:50:10,317 --> 00:50:11,200
Scott: Okay anyway.

700
00:50:12,161 --> 00:50:19,120
Scott: So the reason that they are bad is some of them are like storing your passwords encrypted in the cloud somewhere.

701
00:50:19,321 --> 00:50:21,630
Scott: So now it's theoretically possible.

702
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:24,260
Scott: someone could like get your passwords because they're stored somewhere.

703
00:50:24,461 --> 00:50:27,652
Scott: It depends even if your passwords are only stored on your computer.

704
00:50:27,913 --> 00:50:28,936
Scott: They're stored.

705
00:50:29,137 --> 00:50:30,080
Scott: They're written down.

706
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,467
Scott: They're in a place where they can be stolen from.

707
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:36,457
Scott: the password should not exist anywhere other than your brain.

708
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:38,022
Rym: So think of it.

709
00:50:38,083 --> 00:50:42,640
Rym: like you're saying you've got 20 keys to all the different buildings you go into on a daily basis.

710
00:50:43,001 --> 00:51:06,770
Rym: what these password services do in the best-case scenario is they give you a box and You put all your keys in that box and then you lock that with one key And then because physical analogues don't work that one key now magically has the properties of all those other keys Meaning if someone steals that one key they can get into all your buildings instead of just the one.

711
00:51:06,993 --> 00:51:07,236
Scott: All right.

712
00:51:07,297 --> 00:51:08,189
Scott: So what should you do?

713
00:51:08,350 --> 00:51:16,110
Scott: well, if you I've said this before in the show for sure, but if you have something super secure and Super important you need the best password.

714
00:51:16,471 --> 00:51:19,402
Scott: There's a thing called dice where and that's what you should use.

715
00:51:19,744 --> 00:51:25,202
Scott: you roll some fucking dice And it brings you up a big-ass long sentence full of words.

716
00:51:25,282 --> 00:51:27,850
Rym: This protects you from random number generator.

717
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:30,361
Scott: It's relative key logger attacks.

718
00:51:30,521 --> 00:51:32,530
Scott: It's relatively easy to remember.

719
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:36,830
Rym: Well, I guess not at use key logger attacks, but at create generation keylog attacks.

720
00:51:37,435 --> 00:51:41,637
Scott: It will generate for you an amazing password that is super secure.

721
00:51:41,938 --> 00:51:48,995
Scott: that is relatively easy to remember compared to its secureness and You just remember it and it's awesome.

722
00:51:49,797 --> 00:51:51,000
Scott: And so anything you really care.

723
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:51,321
Scott: I'm gonna.

724
00:51:51,361 --> 00:51:55,130
Scott: I've been slowly trying to convert every single password to dice Where?

725
00:51:56,430 --> 00:51:57,859
Scott: But you know, I have so many passwords.

726
00:51:57,879 --> 00:51:58,725
Scott: It's sort of an ordeal.

727
00:51:58,745 --> 00:52:03,603
Scott: Yeah So here's other things that I use right now that are pretty good.

728
00:52:03,944 --> 00:52:04,164
Scott: Right?

729
00:52:04,525 --> 00:52:08,889
Scott: So I use a thing called Super super gen pass.

730
00:52:09,134 --> 00:52:11,134
Scott: Oh, yeah So super gen pass.

731
00:52:11,154 --> 00:52:16,550
Scott: the way it works is you remember one password in your brain only right and you might be going.

732
00:52:16,651 --> 00:52:18,829
Scott: Oh, no, I'm typing my password into the shady website.

733
00:52:19,011 --> 00:52:21,926
Scott: But no, I've looked at the source code for super gen pass.

734
00:52:21,966 --> 00:52:22,770
Scott: It's not that complicated.

735
00:52:22,770 --> 00:52:25,058
Scott: There's not that much in there and it's a hundred percent JavaScript.

736
00:52:25,118 --> 00:52:28,429
Scott: It runs totally on your computer and sends nothing anywhere, right.

737
00:52:28,449 --> 00:52:49,592
Scott: and The way it works is you type in your password and then you type in the domain of the website you need the password for and it uses math that I'm not going to explain to combine that one password you remembered with the Domain of the website to generate a unique password for that website And that's the password you actually use on that website Meaning

738
00:52:49,813 --> 00:52:57,342
Rym: even if you're using the same password in your brain and say that website Just stores your password clear text and their server gets compromised.

739
00:52:57,643 --> 00:52:59,930
Rym: the password that was stolen is literally worthless.

740
00:53:00,596 --> 00:53:03,797
Rym: It's not any other website, yep If I can you become.

741
00:53:03,837 --> 00:53:06,490
Scott: you're effectively using the same password in every website.

742
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:21,130
Scott: You have to remember the one password but You're actually using a different password on every website and all you need is this little bit of code and the domain names To sort of combine the password you remember with the domain to get the real password to log into that site.

743
00:53:21,372 --> 00:53:23,990
Scott: Yeah, now your passwords are not stored anywhere.

744
00:53:24,391 --> 00:53:29,630
Scott: No one can like find your password by like stealing some files or decrypting anything or anything like that.

745
00:53:30,171 --> 00:53:36,750
Scott: They if they break into that website while they broke into that website, but your account is you know gonna be fine, right?

746
00:53:36,890 --> 00:53:39,786
Rym: No, I actually do something very similar, but I just do it in my head.

747
00:53:39,847 --> 00:53:42,958
Rym: I have an algorithm I can follow in my head based on sure.

748
00:53:43,018 --> 00:53:45,124
Scott: It's less mad and mathematically rigorous.

749
00:53:45,204 --> 00:53:45,606
Scott: Of course.

750
00:53:45,646 --> 00:53:47,090
Scott: It's some fancy hashing?

751
00:53:47,311 --> 00:53:50,501
Rym: It is definitely not but I feel like it's sufficient.

752
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:53,390
Scott: I mean we've talked about it's probably sufficient the level.

753
00:53:53,510 --> 00:54:03,110
Rym: It doesn't take much how crazy you are about passwords and security and all these things Opsack is just what's your level of paranoia and what's your level of acceptable risk versus convenience?

754
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:06,084
Scott: Another thing I use is called password card.

755
00:54:06,145 --> 00:54:07,150
Rym: password cards are real good.

756
00:54:07,451 --> 00:54:13,250
Rym: I recommend this to anyone who I think is too dumb to use a more technological solution, right?

757
00:54:13,471 --> 00:54:15,290
Rym: So smart enough to realize that they need a solution.

758
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:24,397
Scott: the way password card works is you go to this website password card and you randomly generate a password card, right and they've made hundreds of thousands of password cards.

759
00:54:24,518 --> 00:54:28,732
Scott: and then you print it out and it prints you this nice little card with symbols and numbers all Over it right.

760
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:32,165
Scott: and then you go to a website and you need a new password.

761
00:54:32,225 --> 00:54:34,534
Scott: or you got a new account You need a new password.

762
00:54:34,554 --> 00:54:41,150
Scott: You look at your password card and you say which combination of these weird symbols Am I gonna use for the password for this banking website?

763
00:54:41,690 --> 00:54:48,107
Scott: Maybe I'll start at the dollar sign and go down to the right Diagonally and then back up in a v-shape and I'll use those symbols, right?

764
00:54:48,127 --> 00:54:51,570
Rym: Okay I've never gone that complex with my password card usage.

765
00:54:51,853 --> 00:54:59,650
Scott: I'm just saying that's an example Right of something you might do and you remember because the bank website to start at the dollar sign and to go in the v-shape.

766
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:01,779
Scott: Because whatever you just have to remember that little bit.

767
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:07,210
Scott: you just remember a smaller piece of information Which is where on this password card is my password?

768
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:11,430
Scott: Which is easier to remember than the actual crazy password full of symbols and nonsense.

769
00:55:12,052 --> 00:55:17,850
Scott: And then you'd pull out your password card and you look at it and it's like having your passwords written down on a paper.

770
00:55:18,574 --> 00:55:30,339
Scott: But unlike having your passwords written down on paper no one can take the paper and Figure out your password because they take this paper and it's a fucking jumble of nonsense and they don't know where on this piece of Paper your password is.

771
00:55:30,359 --> 00:55:31,629
Scott: it's just a jumble.

772
00:55:33,356 --> 00:55:35,583
Scott: It means nothing to nobody except you.

773
00:55:36,045 --> 00:55:41,890
Rym: if you use it naively It gives people a bunch of low-hanging fruit guesses as to what your past.

774
00:55:41,930 --> 00:55:46,928
Scott: Yes, if you're like, oh well my password to the banking website is start at the dollar sign and go straight down.

775
00:55:46,948 --> 00:55:48,609
Scott: Yep Don't do that.

776
00:55:48,751 --> 00:55:49,254
Rym: But here's the more.

777
00:55:49,275 --> 00:55:51,330
Rym: this is where we're gonna deviate from the shows we've done in the past.

778
00:55:51,892 --> 00:56:15,250
Rym: This in particular is a good case study because it still generates the kind of entropy focused unintelligible passwords that hitherto have been considered secure and NIST has issued updated guidelines and basically the best practices today are to not use Passwords like this and instead to use pass phrases because that way you don't need a token.

779
00:56:15,733 --> 00:56:23,430
Rym: It goes back to being what passwords originally are Something that literally only exists in your brain and only comes out of your brain when you're entering it to authenticate.

780
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,954
Rym: Yep So what?

781
00:56:25,014 --> 00:56:44,048
Rym: NIST has basically been issued a whole bunch of guidelines and these were earlier this year and there's been a lot of debate about it, but the idea is that humans are not good at remembering a random string of uppercase and lowercase ridiculous characters and You'll actually generate more entropy by just typing a very long password that consists of words.

782
00:56:44,931 --> 00:56:49,768
Scott: Yeah, if you just have a ton of lowercase letter think about it, you know, okay, so one character, right?

783
00:56:50,911 --> 00:56:52,698
Scott: You're using 26 letters of the alphabet.

784
00:56:52,819 --> 00:56:55,650
Scott: Okay, uppercase and lowercase and you got eight characters.

785
00:56:55,690 --> 00:56:56,573
Scott: So eight times 26.

786
00:56:56,573 --> 00:56:59,862
Scott: Well 26 to the eighth power possibilities.

787
00:56:59,922 --> 00:57:02,610
Scott: It's a lot of possibilities, but not for a fucking computer.

788
00:57:02,731 --> 00:57:03,317
Scott: It's not.

789
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:08,419
Scott: no no, no, so You could increase the number of characters you allow.

790
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:11,006
Scott: allow hyphens question marks plus minus divide.

791
00:57:11,086 --> 00:57:14,241
Scott: Okay, so now it's 40 to the 8th power.

792
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:20,803
Scott: Okay How much bigger is 40 to the 8th power compared to 26 to the 8th power?

793
00:57:21,044 --> 00:57:25,717
Rym: and you really gonna remember T uppercase V You that weird double s squiggly underscore.

794
00:57:25,778 --> 00:57:28,486
Rym: underscore 9 1 1 8 4 uppercase T.

795
00:57:28,566 --> 00:57:42,590
Scott: You know, what if you want I I I you just take 26 to the 9th power the 10th power the 11th power the 12th power Your complexity is going to increase much much more rapidly than it will allowing more characters, right?

796
00:57:43,551 --> 00:57:49,490
Scott: So just between uppercase lowercase and space you've got 53 characters, I guess, right?

797
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:51,306
Scott: Yeah, you don't need to include anything else.

798
00:57:51,306 --> 00:57:58,250
Scott: 53 characters to the very long sentence that has you know, five five-letter words.

799
00:57:58,511 --> 00:58:03,690
Scott: That's now 50 something to the 25th power and all you have to remember is a sentence with five words.

800
00:58:03,791 --> 00:58:06,364
Rym: And let's say let's say do you stuff you remember like?

801
00:58:06,384 --> 00:58:07,470
Rym: let's say I'm really into Tolkien.

802
00:58:07,571 --> 00:58:08,438
Rym: So I use a really lot.

803
00:58:08,459 --> 00:58:14,981
Scott: like I use a Tolkien quote You can write looky mighty right and it's like.

804
00:58:15,281 --> 00:58:18,550
Scott: looky mighty is already a great password because it's like a ton of letters.

805
00:58:18,831 --> 00:58:21,686
Scott: But if you write the whole fucking thing, like my name is Ozzie.

806
00:58:21,706 --> 00:58:22,590
Scott: Mandy is king of kings.

807
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:24,335
Scott: Look upon my works ye mighty and despair.

808
00:58:24,816 --> 00:58:25,899
Scott: That's hella long.

809
00:58:26,301 --> 00:58:27,685
Scott: You can always remember that.

810
00:58:27,725 --> 00:58:31,621
Scott: look I just quoted it and Nobody's guessing that in a million fucking years.

811
00:58:31,741 --> 00:58:33,430
Scott: Yeah, that is super secure password.

812
00:58:33,772 --> 00:58:42,429
Scott: I feel like if there's someone your name is Rym and that's what people are gonna guess Day one, but if you're like guess number if your name is not Rym, no one's guessing that yep.

813
00:58:42,971 --> 00:58:50,014
Rym: So this wants everyone to increase the maximum length of passwords to at least 64.

814
00:58:50,014 --> 00:58:51,920
Scott: that sounds good to me which is perfect now.

815
00:58:52,061 --> 00:58:54,188
Rym: I'd like to see what sentence are you not?

816
00:58:54,268 --> 00:58:54,830
Scott: Yeah, why not?

817
00:58:54,830 --> 00:58:56,594
Scott: 128 256.

818
00:58:56,594 --> 00:59:00,086
Rym: well cuz right now you got a shocking number of sites.

819
00:59:00,146 --> 00:59:01,230
Rym: limit you to like 16.

820
00:59:01,230 --> 00:59:11,302
Rym: Yeah That's awful, which is not enough because actually the passwords that I use today that I algorithmically generate I decided not to use passphrases because so many things I log into.

821
00:59:11,583 --> 00:59:13,510
Rym: don't let me have long enough passwords for that.

822
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:14,930
Scott: Yeah, that's a super problem.

823
00:59:16,291 --> 00:59:24,149
Scott: That's the number one thing keeping me from a hundred percent dice where besides laziness is a lot of sites I can't because they don't allow my password to be that long.

824
00:59:24,672 --> 00:59:29,195
Rym: So another no reason is to have no Composition rules.

825
00:59:29,255 --> 00:59:32,267
Rym: do not require people to use uppercase and lowercase right now.

826
00:59:32,287 --> 00:59:32,910
Rym: require numbers.

827
00:59:32,950 --> 00:59:33,878
Rym: Do not require symbols.

828
00:59:33,918 --> 00:59:34,523
Scott: think about this.

829
00:59:34,805 --> 00:59:40,330
Scott: if you have it Let's say you have a two-letter password right and you require uppercase.

830
00:59:40,430 --> 00:59:43,059
Scott: Well now you've actually just decreased the possibilities.

831
00:59:43,761 --> 00:59:46,630
Scott: the search space of all legal passwords is now smaller.

832
00:59:46,871 --> 00:59:47,595
Scott: Yeah, you might.

833
00:59:47,997 --> 00:59:57,879
Rym: it's like sure even if you get up to eight twelve That has three digits on it and you have a rule that says no two digits can be the same that it makes it way Easy to figure out your pick combination.

834
00:59:57,899 --> 01:00:00,030
Scott: Yeah, they just removed a lot of possible combinations.

835
01:00:00,351 --> 01:00:11,550
Scott: So even though you might be allowing someone to have a stupid password like password That still forces the person who's trying to guess the password to go through every possible guess.

836
01:00:11,630 --> 01:00:14,906
Scott: They can't just eliminate all these guesses like oh this one doesn't have uppercase.

837
01:00:14,927 --> 01:00:15,550
Scott: Don't even try it.

838
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:16,739
Scott: This one doesn't have a number.

839
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:18,110
Scott: don't even try it, right?

840
01:00:18,271 --> 01:00:22,050
Rym: So they basically say have a minimum and have a very high maximum.

841
01:00:22,311 --> 01:00:25,382
Rym: Yep, and the minimum minimum is eight now, which is fine.

842
01:00:25,582 --> 01:00:28,073
Scott: It is good, but I'd make the minimum like 12.

843
01:00:28,073 --> 01:00:29,589
Rym: Yeah, I would make the minimum higher.

844
01:00:29,756 --> 01:00:30,852
Rym: Yeah but 16.

845
01:00:30,852 --> 01:00:31,578
Rym: I'm on this website.

846
01:00:31,598 --> 01:00:36,521
Rym: that I think is a summary of some of the news Guidelines and make sure you allow spaces because that's what allows phrases.

847
01:00:36,581 --> 01:00:39,330
Rym: They say it very succinctly here favor the user.

848
01:00:39,871 --> 01:00:54,545
Rym: Make your password policies user-friendly to put the burden on the verifier not the password user Mm-hmm, and the verifier is not gonna have any more or less trouble with a long quote from Tolkien than it will from a long String of unintelligible characters.

849
01:00:54,565 --> 01:00:55,029
Scott: That's right.

850
01:00:56,911 --> 01:01:07,602
Rym: So, you know the basic dictionary stuff, but the no composition rules is a big problem because so many things require ridiculous bullshit in their passwords Mm-hmm, and that's like.

851
01:01:08,287 --> 01:01:11,382
Rym: as a result I still like my not everyone's following these guidelines.

852
01:01:11,442 --> 01:01:13,250
Scott: In fact few people are following these guidelines.

853
01:01:13,371 --> 01:01:22,403
Rym: I have had let's just say in a professional capacity Large Very well-funded institutions that require this bullshit.

854
01:01:22,443 --> 01:01:24,650
Scott: who has really really awful password practices?

855
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:26,414
Scott: American Express.

856
01:01:26,515 --> 01:01:30,370
Scott: Yep, American Express forces you to use a tiny garbage password.

857
01:01:30,430 --> 01:01:33,841
Scott: Yeah, it's like for something that should be very very secure.

858
01:01:34,101 --> 01:01:35,004
Scott: your fucking money.

859
01:01:35,526 --> 01:01:36,669
Scott: Don't use American Express.

860
01:01:37,973 --> 01:01:39,645
Rym: So Amtrak for a long time.

861
01:01:39,665 --> 01:01:40,350
Rym: I don't know if it's changed.

862
01:01:40,531 --> 01:01:41,681
Rym: I still use my weird old password.

863
01:01:41,701 --> 01:01:47,370
Rym: there had so many Requirements that I could not make any of the algorithms I used to generate passwords work with it.

864
01:01:47,691 --> 01:01:53,470
Rym: So I basically for a while made a throwaway password and did an email password reset every time I had to log into their site.

865
01:01:53,530 --> 01:01:54,535
Scott: That's not a bad system.

866
01:01:54,576 --> 01:01:57,330
Scott: In fact for a while, that's basically two-factor, right?

867
01:01:57,430 --> 01:02:06,050
Scott: Mozilla was like bullshitty - Mozilla was using was developing this thing that they said I was gonna use but they Closed it because it was called persona?

868
01:02:06,251 --> 01:02:06,895
Scott: I think no.

869
01:02:07,036 --> 01:02:09,210
Scott: and it they closed it because it didn't get enough traction.

870
01:02:09,732 --> 01:02:14,347
Scott: But actually I thought it was gonna be great because basically what it did is it did exactly that.

871
01:02:14,407 --> 01:02:17,530
Scott: it's like oh well password You know email reset is the thing.

872
01:02:17,630 --> 01:02:24,639
Scott: so what we'll do is we'll just when you log in we send you an email you go to the email and click and now You're logged in for as long as the cookie lasts.

873
01:02:24,659 --> 01:02:25,102
Scott: and that's it.

874
01:02:25,363 --> 01:02:29,830
Scott: No bothering with stupid passwords Just email email the thing only if that lets you reset.

875
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:30,042
Scott: Why not?

876
01:02:30,210 --> 01:02:31,755
Scott: Just let it have it log you in.

877
01:02:32,116 --> 01:02:42,909
Scott: and then it also included some fancier ways to let you log in because the idea would That you would you know open ID was the was now also now dead which would be I had an open ID.

878
01:02:43,211 --> 01:02:45,530
Rym: Yeah, it's tied to a Yuba key that no longer works.

879
01:02:45,550 --> 01:02:46,803
Scott: Yeah Open ID was a thing.

880
01:02:46,884 --> 01:02:52,770
Scott: for a while The old Yuba key until the login with Google login to Facebook login with Twitter Oh off took over instead.

881
01:02:52,830 --> 01:02:55,559
Scott: Yeah But the idea would that be you would be log into.

882
01:02:55,599 --> 01:02:59,554
Scott: you would set up your own sort of off server with you know Sort of open ID way.

883
01:02:59,955 --> 01:03:03,990
Scott: log in do it with the persona and your open ID fashion with the email.

884
01:03:04,415 --> 01:03:05,690
Scott: So no, you didn't even type in a password.

885
01:03:05,810 --> 01:03:15,098
Scott: All you did is you guess you login you did your email you click the thing you're logged in and then when you go to other websites That uses Oh off to connect you in.

886
01:03:15,118 --> 01:03:21,810
Scott: so you never had to have a password anywhere and just log in everywhere with your one persona login at that one place that you completely control.

887
01:03:22,071 --> 01:03:23,937
Scott: Yep, and that never came to be so.

888
01:03:23,957 --> 01:03:32,245
Rym: some of the other guidelines and these are more for people who are developing all systems Never allow people to use password hints nor require them.

889
01:03:32,345 --> 01:03:36,140
Scott: looking at a lot of websites Yep, how you go to win even Microsoft Windows?

890
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:38,650
Scott: Yeah, you can have a password hint on the screen.

891
01:03:38,770 --> 01:03:39,754
Rym: It made me type something.

892
01:03:40,277 --> 01:03:42,024
Rym: Yeah, I typed the word fuck.

893
01:03:42,185 --> 01:03:44,314
Scott: I just left it there work I just type.

894
01:03:44,494 --> 01:03:45,177
Scott: I forget what I type.

895
01:03:45,197 --> 01:03:45,800
Scott: you said whatever.

896
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:47,186
Scott: Yeah, nothing.

897
01:03:47,266 --> 01:03:48,030
Scott: Nothing helpful.

898
01:03:50,830 --> 01:03:54,199
Rym: Knowledge-based authentication is obviously a terrible idea.

899
01:03:54,219 --> 01:03:56,665
Rym: This is usually a problem with password recovery.

900
01:03:56,706 --> 01:03:58,390
Rym: Like what was the name of your favorite pet?

901
01:03:58,510 --> 01:03:59,588
Rym: What's your mom's middle name?

902
01:03:59,971 --> 01:04:05,983
Scott: Someone can some someone can find out my mom's middle name so I don't actually type my mom's middle name there I type something else.

903
01:04:06,165 --> 01:04:10,687
Scott: Yep So if someone finds out, you know, they can research and find out my mom's middle name or my.

904
01:04:11,048 --> 01:04:12,388
Scott: you know Pets name or what?

905
01:04:13,271 --> 01:04:18,281
Scott: School, I went to so I always put something else there Which is helpful, but probably the most important one.

906
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:28,961
Rym: if you run a system Never people never require people to change their passwords and never expire passwords Unless like my work which expires them all the goddamn time.

907
01:04:29,222 --> 01:04:32,834
Rym: Oh my god, don't even get me started about some LDAP nonsense I've been dealing with recently.

908
01:04:32,954 --> 01:04:39,075
Rym: Yeah, but two if you're a user of passwords, which I hope you are Don't just rent the.

909
01:04:39,236 --> 01:04:45,296
Rym: don't change your passwords regularly pick passwords and use them unless you have a reason to change them Like a site was compromised.

910
01:04:45,316 --> 01:04:48,927
Rym: Yeah, if you change your passwords frequently, you're more likely to forget them and have trouble Mm-hmm.

911
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:58,600
Scott: And if you're more likely to forget them You're more likely to use a less good password, right if you if you have some super long sentence But you type it a hundred times a day every day forever.

912
01:04:58,921 --> 01:05:00,065
Scott: You're gonna remember it forever.

913
01:05:00,126 --> 01:05:01,230
Scott: It's gonna stay secure forever.

914
01:05:01,370 --> 01:05:11,410
Scott: Yep, it's the math means they need like a billion years to guess it until the quantum computer is invented So don't you don't have to change it except for every billion years now.

915
01:05:11,771 --> 01:05:22,969
Rym: I guess the important gist of this is that all the things you should do to make your passwords better are Not really supported by a lot of the things people need to log into Mm-hmm, which is a problem.

916
01:05:23,331 --> 01:05:29,672
Scott: Well a good thing you can do for example is like I was talking before about the login with Google login with Twitter login with Facebook.

917
01:05:29,793 --> 01:05:33,950
Scott: yep, a lot of those places like Google will allow you to have the real deal password.

918
01:05:34,211 --> 01:05:38,469
Rym: Yep, Google password, which is the literally the most important password in the world, right?

919
01:05:39,010 --> 01:05:41,330
Rym: It's a really long password.

920
01:05:41,430 --> 01:05:48,910
Scott: So use those things if you have the opportunity because then even if some website is real shitty and doesn't have good password policy You don't need a password on the website.

921
01:05:48,990 --> 01:05:55,744
Scott: Just log in with Google and since your Google safe your web your account on that site is safe and you're good You don't need a password there.

922
01:05:55,886 --> 01:05:56,048
Scott: Yep.

923
01:05:56,692 --> 01:06:01,830
Rym: So the other interesting thing is that I mean we've talked about two-factor before and obviously you should use two-factor wherever possible.

924
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:13,190
Rym: Mm-hmm because the concept of passwords in a real secure environment is increasingly obsolete Because while it may be a token that only exists in your brain in an ideal world.

925
01:06:13,591 --> 01:06:20,378
Rym: The reality is they are trivially compromised by key loggers malware Hide-resolution cameras.

926
01:06:20,498 --> 01:06:23,670
Scott: It's always possible that someone could still get my password.

927
01:06:23,791 --> 01:06:25,330
Scott: What if like someone's in one of the you know?

928
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:27,801
Scott: I'm not gonna close my window every time I type my password right.

929
01:06:27,842 --> 01:06:36,790
Scott: maybe somebody in an adjacent building It's a super long zoomy lens and zooms into my fingers and records in slow-mo high def and they see me type in the password.

930
01:06:37,031 --> 01:06:43,690
Scott: it's like there are ways to get someone's password no matter how fucking good the password is if you're Going through enough effort.

931
01:06:43,770 --> 01:06:51,698
Scott: so if something is secure enough and valuable enough that more likely someone is to go through with the effort to get that password and They can get it.

932
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:52,122
Rym: Yep.

933
01:06:52,223 --> 01:06:57,427
Scott: So that's Starbucks with the security camera typing your password on your laptop.

934
01:06:57,728 --> 01:07:06,843
Rym: Yeah What I say the other day if you live in a building that has a doorman or work in a building as a doorman That doorman probably knows the unlock code to everyone's phones.

935
01:07:07,425 --> 01:07:07,666
Rym: Yes.

936
01:07:07,746 --> 01:07:08,208
Rym: What are you doing?

937
01:07:08,228 --> 01:07:08,670
Rym: You're an elevator.

938
01:07:08,710 --> 01:07:09,316
Rym: You open your phone.

939
01:07:09,336 --> 01:07:11,292
Rym: look at Twitter for the 30 seconds It takes.

940
01:07:11,533 --> 01:07:13,340
Rym: yeah, you might say oh, but I use my phone.

941
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:14,104
Rym: I use the fingerprint.

942
01:07:14,465 --> 01:07:15,570
Rym: That's even easier to get.

943
01:07:15,872 --> 01:07:16,900
Scott: Yeah, touch.

944
01:07:17,101 --> 01:07:18,109
Rym: Did you touch anything?

945
01:07:20,655 --> 01:07:21,685
Rym: In fact, I only steal.

946
01:07:21,705 --> 01:07:22,129
Scott: you have it.

947
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:29,043
Scott: I have it set to where the fingerprint will only open it after a very short locking period After a long locking period like I actually put the phone away.

948
01:07:29,124 --> 01:07:30,470
Scott: I need to type up password again.

949
01:07:30,690 --> 01:07:37,490
Scott: Yeah, not some pin not a swipey thing with lines Android actually typing in a real password on the phone.

950
01:07:38,330 --> 01:07:41,598
Rym: Yeah, because What do you touch your phone with?

951
01:07:41,658 --> 01:07:44,430
Rym: primarily probably your thumb or your fingers?

952
01:07:45,110 --> 01:07:55,170
Rym: Your fingerprints are all over your phone and I've seen there's been many proofs of concept of extracting those fingerprints Printing a 3d model on rubber or something and then just open in a phone.

953
01:07:55,311 --> 01:07:58,930
Scott: But anyway, you need the two-factor because someone can get the password.

954
01:07:59,131 --> 01:08:07,513
Scott: But to get the password and to also get a physical thing that you possess in your possession is very very difficult Right.

955
01:08:07,734 --> 01:08:10,850
Scott: Oh they zoomed in with the zoom lens and they saw me typing in the password.

956
01:08:10,950 --> 01:08:12,034
Scott: This is the security camera.

957
01:08:12,054 --> 01:08:17,350
Scott: the Starbucks recorded my password when I was typing it in and they don't have my phone because I own It.

958
01:08:17,411 --> 01:08:18,636
Scott: it's in my hand right now.

959
01:08:18,676 --> 01:08:19,982
Scott: They didn't rob me and mug me.

960
01:08:20,665 --> 01:08:21,729
Scott: Oh the mugger mugged me.

961
01:08:21,810 --> 01:08:23,337
Scott: He's got my phone, but he didn't.

962
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:25,490
Scott: he's not the same person who stole my password.

963
01:08:25,791 --> 01:08:37,189
Scott: so you to do both things in the level of difficulty there is so high and The things that you a GeekNights listener have are so not valuable that it's so not worth it.

964
01:08:37,611 --> 01:08:42,550
Scott: Yeah, if you have a two-factor you safe, you know you very safe as an aside.

965
01:08:43,470 --> 01:08:45,037
Scott: safe, but so safe.

966
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:54,790
Rym: one of the other changes is that they have formally Obsoleted the idea of using SMS as a second factor.

967
01:08:55,413 --> 01:09:03,416
Scott: Looking at you looking at you twitch and Fucking Twitter Tumblr Fuck all you dude support.

968
01:09:03,475 --> 01:09:04,921
Scott: Oh off you I have a Yuba key.

969
01:09:05,183 --> 01:09:08,076
Scott: Let me let me use my fucking you know Google authenticator app.

970
01:09:08,337 --> 01:09:08,679
Rym: I have you.

971
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:10,026
Rym: I could literally plug my Yuba key.

972
01:09:10,046 --> 01:09:10,850
Rym: I have a physical token.

973
01:09:10,910 --> 01:09:12,716
Scott: I plug into USB plug it into your phone.

974
01:09:12,737 --> 01:09:16,894
Rym: Uh, you can if you get the RFID one, you don't have the NFC one You don't have that one.

975
01:09:17,035 --> 01:09:17,738
Rym: I could get that one.

976
01:09:18,041 --> 01:09:19,450
Rym: Actually you can do three factors.

977
01:09:19,551 --> 01:09:20,420
Rym: So there is a way.

978
01:09:20,682 --> 01:09:26,550
Rym: if you have an Android phone It won't work on iPhones because Apple won't let them because a lot of dumb reasons for that.

979
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:36,743
Rym: But you can get a token a physical like token that has RNG stuff in it with NFC And you use the Google authenticator app on your phone and a password.

980
01:09:37,206 --> 01:09:43,760
Rym: the authenticator app Can't generate the numbers unless you have the RFID token against your phone.

981
01:09:44,162 --> 01:09:45,890
Scott: if I ever have a company everyone has to do that.

982
01:09:46,151 --> 01:09:46,834
Scott: Yeah, that would be.

983
01:09:46,874 --> 01:09:49,426
Rym: that would be like if the company did anything that mattered.

984
01:09:49,667 --> 01:09:52,515
Rym: Yeah I'm not doing that for our convention.

985
01:09:52,756 --> 01:09:57,423
Scott: No, I'm talking about for like the bank or the you know Expensive shit.

986
01:09:57,606 --> 01:10:00,757
Rym: Yep So, uh, but they you can.

987
01:10:00,958 --> 01:10:03,505
Rym: SMS does not count as two-factor right now.

988
01:10:03,525 --> 01:10:04,729
Scott: You might think well, wait a minute.

989
01:10:04,749 --> 01:10:05,170
Scott: Wait a minute.

990
01:10:05,230 --> 01:10:07,500
Scott: What's wrong with having someone just text me the code?

991
01:10:07,541 --> 01:10:09,570
Scott: That's the same as emailing me the code, right?

992
01:10:10,570 --> 01:10:13,942
Scott: No, it's not and this is why I'm using Gmail.

993
01:10:14,022 --> 01:10:17,354
Scott: right in order for someone to get in that Gmail They had a hey Google.

994
01:10:17,535 --> 01:10:22,030
Scott: They need the really good password and the end the Google authenticator app for my phone.

995
01:10:22,311 --> 01:10:26,090
Scott: They ain't getting in there to get my email or they have to break into Google's nonsense.

996
01:10:26,672 --> 01:10:30,865
Scott: Good luck breaking into actual Google and all that shits encrypted on their servers.

997
01:10:30,945 --> 01:10:32,350
Scott: Anyway, yeah, good luck.

998
01:10:32,450 --> 01:10:34,017
Scott: So so SMS one.

999
01:10:34,097 --> 01:10:34,620
Scott: what happens?

1000
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:35,283
Scott: what it's clear.

1001
01:10:35,303 --> 01:10:36,930
Scott: Someone sends me a text message.

1002
01:10:37,372 --> 01:10:38,216
Scott: It's not encrypted.

1003
01:10:38,256 --> 01:10:46,147
Scott: that text message can be spied upon on the network Especially if I'm getting wife text over Wi-Fi or something, right like use an iMessage or who knows what.

1004
01:10:46,207 --> 01:10:49,519
Rym: now that is Obscurity because it's like sniffing.

1005
01:10:49,579 --> 01:10:54,697
Rym: that kind of traffic is a giant pain in the ass, but it's possible And it's not even that hard.

1006
01:10:54,717 --> 01:10:58,330
Scott: and that text message doesn't originate like on some phone system.

1007
01:10:58,390 --> 01:11:06,481
Scott: It originates on the internet and then it only hits the phone system like near the when it gets close to me and that whole Area, it's unencrypted and snoopable on the internet.

1008
01:11:06,501 --> 01:11:21,770
Scott: All right, not only that But it has been proven that the customer support Services at all of the phone companies in the United States, especially but also probably other places are very susceptible to social engineering.

1009
01:11:22,051 --> 01:11:30,515
Scott: I could trivially with what I know about my friend say Rym Call his phone carrier t-mobile, which I know because I'm his friend.

1010
01:11:30,635 --> 01:11:41,693
Scott: Yep and convinced them that this phone I just bought is rims new phone and they should begin to send all of rims phone calls phone number and text messages to this phone that I just Bought at the store.

1011
01:11:42,154 --> 01:11:45,405
Scott: and that rims phone was lost stolen fell in a toilet.

1012
01:11:45,505 --> 01:11:46,950
Scott: something like that seems implausible.

1013
01:11:47,171 --> 01:11:57,776
Rym: I had to call t-mobile a while ago because my data plan literally stopped working SMS work, but data didn't and at no point when I was like Changing Sims.

1014
01:11:58,078 --> 01:12:00,670
Rym: Did I have to prove my identity to anyone?

1015
01:12:00,810 --> 01:12:09,401
Scott: So I'm sitting there trying to log into rims tumblr and it says oh by the way We just texted you a message for off And I go Oh rims using two-factor.

1016
01:12:09,663 --> 01:12:19,169
Scott: Let me just take this spare phone Call t-mobile get rims number ported to my phone in ten minutes and then log into team log into tumblr again and Okay.

1017
01:12:19,692 --> 01:12:24,346
Scott: Now the OAuth was the message is sent to this phone and I logged in and the two-factor was worthless.

1018
01:12:24,748 --> 01:12:25,470
Rym: now the art.

1019
01:12:25,691 --> 01:12:50,268
Rym: Some people multiple people when I was talking about this back when this guidelines like the the request for comments period was going on Had a counter-argument and their argument was yes SMS two-factor is insecure But for the majority of people it's one better than nothing and two by deprecating it You're harming all the people who are too poor to have a smartphone You

1020
01:12:51,072 --> 01:12:52,216
Scott: Should be sending you you.

1021
01:12:52,316 --> 01:12:56,590
Scott: first of all, they're very very inexpensive smartphones available these days that are cheap.

1022
01:12:57,032 --> 01:12:58,759
Scott: Yeah, they're cheaper than flip phones.

1023
01:12:59,060 --> 01:13:02,880
Scott: like to get a phone that can run the Google off app You don't even need data.

1024
01:13:03,041 --> 01:13:03,948
Scott: You can get iPhone one.

1025
01:13:04,311 --> 01:13:06,989
Rym: Remember the Google off app does not need data to work.

1026
01:13:07,211 --> 01:13:07,977
Scott: You know iPod touch?

1027
01:13:08,078 --> 01:13:09,610
Rym: it generates the codes on the phone.

1028
01:13:09,931 --> 01:13:10,957
Scott: You can get some old they should.

1029
01:13:11,058 --> 01:13:13,250
Scott: Google's just make little tiny things that do the off app.

1030
01:13:13,511 --> 01:13:15,784
Scott: That's all they do and to they'd be like five bucks.

1031
01:13:16,126 --> 01:13:21,425
Rym: I would argue that Giving someone a false sense of security is way worse than them.

1032
01:13:21,505 --> 01:13:22,710
Rym: Just having bad security.

1033
01:13:22,931 --> 01:13:35,045
Rym: uh-huh, if you think the door to your house locks and you don't realize that like Literally anyone could open the door and only you don't realize this That's way more dangerous than you being afraid that someone's gonna open your door in any right.

1034
01:13:35,106 --> 01:13:36,832
Scott: if you have a door with no lock On it.

1035
01:13:36,932 --> 01:13:37,877
Scott: It's like all right.

1036
01:13:37,897 --> 01:13:39,504
Scott: Well, at least I know I'm not safe.

1037
01:13:39,524 --> 01:13:40,690
Scott: I'm gonna sit here with my shoddy.

1038
01:13:40,932 --> 01:13:46,238
Scott: Yeah, but if you have a door you think is locked I'm told no one getting this safe.

1039
01:13:46,519 --> 01:13:48,549
Scott: It's fucking Fort Knox and then someone walks the fuck in.

1040
01:13:48,910 --> 01:13:50,114
Scott: you're a shoddy across the room.

1041
01:13:50,154 --> 01:13:58,249
Rym: now imagine you're pooping in a public bathroom and you think the stall is locked and Someone just opens it and is standing there and pees on you.

1042
01:13:58,631 --> 01:14:01,050
Rym: Yep, which happened to a friend of mine at band camp.

1043
01:14:01,393 --> 01:14:02,929
Scott: But if you see the lock is dark.

1044
01:14:03,291 --> 01:14:10,229
Scott: If you see the lock is clearly not functioning on this stall and all the other stalls are occupied though You can hold that shit close at the finger.

1045
01:14:12,232 --> 01:14:13,540
Scott: You got options when you know.

1046
01:14:13,601 --> 01:14:16,519
Scott: you got to be in the know so people They got to know.

1047
01:14:16,599 --> 01:14:21,930
Scott: if you use the text message off You at least got to let people know so they can hold that close with their finger.

1048
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:22,392
Scott: So

1049
01:14:22,412 --> 01:14:30,524
Rym: my advice to you just so we have a moral because we gave you a lot of advice that a lot of websites won't Let you actually do is other than all the stuff like to do

1050
01:14:30,565 --> 01:14:34,461
Scott: the best you can do Whatever you can do it to the best of your ability.

1051
01:14:34,521 --> 01:14:36,690
Rym: use passphrases that don't expire anywhere.

1052
01:14:36,771 --> 01:14:46,115
Scott: You can do things that are relative According to the value of what you are protecting and if something you didn't put full effort into protecting is stolen Oh deal with it.

1053
01:14:46,135 --> 01:14:46,758
Scott: That's your own fault.

1054
01:14:46,938 --> 01:14:49,469
Rym: And if you're in charge of a system a lot of you work in IT.

1055
01:14:49,732 --> 01:14:51,289
Rym: That's probably why you're listening to get nice Monday.

1056
01:14:52,411 --> 01:14:53,396
Scott: Follow these guidelines.

1057
01:14:53,416 --> 01:14:56,070
Rym: Yes, don't force stupid passwords on your users.

1058
01:14:56,150 --> 01:14:57,696
Rym: Don't expire their passwords.

1059
01:14:57,756 --> 01:15:03,256
Scott: and if say your boss if some if you have some stupid boss who's making you do something stupid Give them this document.

1060
01:15:03,276 --> 01:15:04,260
Scott: show them the guidelines.

01:15:06,670 --> 01:15:09,139
Rym: That's what the DoD probably at least I hope does.

1064
01:15:09,159 --> 01:15:09,561
Rym: Yep.

1065
01:15:09,902 --> 01:15:10,444
Scott: This is the.

1066
01:15:10,645 --> 01:15:12,150
Scott: this is more secure than what we have.

1067
01:15:12,190 --> 01:15:13,557
Scott: You just don't know anything about security.

1068
01:15:13,798 --> 01:15:14,804
Scott: This is what experts say.

1069
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:22,093
Scott: we're doing with the experts say If you don't think I'm an expert that means you don't value expert knowledge in which case you should quit that job Immediately.

Scott: Yep.

1071
01:15:22,474 --> 01:15:23,217

01:15:28,584 --> 01:15:29,530
Rym: Scott should know security.

1077
01:15:29,631 --> 01:15:31,768
Rym: Otherwise like a big website would be in a lot of trouble.

1078
01:15:32,612 --> 01:15:33,595
Scott: But I never had a problem.

1079
01:15:34,337 --> 01:15:45,536
Rym: one of my formal roles and my current company is doing risk analysis and part of that includes writing and Auditing security procedures.

1080
01:15:46,077 --> 01:15:52,874
Rym: I am like I legit am in charge of that stuff for a company and I do it and I research It and you've had zero incidents.

1081
01:15:53,075 --> 01:15:53,315
Scott: Yeah.

1082
01:15:53,396 --> 01:16:10,056
Rym: Well, yeah, I can say this any incident any incident that has ever happened has been due to someone not following a procedure or Circumventing something and the remediation of course is prevent circumvention or force people to follow procedures But fire people.

1083
01:16:10,558 --> 01:16:12,486
Scott: I would have zero tolerance for failing to follow you.

1084
01:16:12,788 --> 01:16:17,339
Scott: That's the one thing It's like if I had to work, you know people I whenever I talk about like yeah I was a boss.

1085
01:16:17,420 --> 01:16:21,796
Scott: I'd be like a million Lazy time on the beach.

1086

Scott: Yeah, not giving a shit take as much time for lunch as you want right laziest workplace.

1087
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:33,590

1088
01:16:33,771 --> 01:16:35,659
Scott: Yeah, you fucked up a security procedure.

1089
01:16:35,679 --> 01:16:38,230

1090
01:16:38,411 --> 01:16:40,639
Rym: Well on the same token, there's a difference between negligence.

1091
01:16:40,659 --> 01:16:41,903
Scott: I'd educate you in advance.

1092
01:16:42,365 --> 01:16:53,089
Scott: do lots of education up front I wouldn't just you know, but well, there is a difference between Satan negligence and gross negligence, for example Sure, but like if someone just leaves the fucking door open or yeah doesn't lock their computer when they stand up.

1093
01:16:53,551 --> 01:16:57,686
Rym: Oh, if someone doesn't like the computer when they stand up goatse is the appropriate punishment for that.

1094
01:16:57,706 --> 01:16:58,268
Scott: That's correct.

1095
01:16:59,935 --> 01:17:03,808

1096
01:17:05,372 --> 01:17:11,430
Rym: I'm sure I could come up with it up with a appropriate similar punishment a leak spin that doesn't go.
