1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:13,394
Rym: It's Monday December 11th 2017.

2
00:00:13,394 --> 00:00:18,310
Rym: I'm Rym, I'm Scott and this is the last Monday episode of GeekNights for 2017.

3
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:23,265
Rym: Yeah, and tonight we're talking about something that in almost 13 years.

4
00:00:23,305 --> 00:00:26,268
Rym: We've somehow never talked about talking about headphones.

5
00:00:29,912 --> 00:00:30,947
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:32,692 --> 00:00:37,490
Rym: So I kept talking about that NAS and if you follow me on Twitter in the forum, I did buy it.

7
00:00:37,751 --> 00:00:41,147
Rym: I bought the five port like Synology 1517 plus whatever.

8
00:00:41,167 --> 00:00:41,870
Scott: I'm sure it's fine.

9
00:00:42,211 --> 00:00:46,730
Rym: I bought six eight terabyte NAS drives and it is just great.

10
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:47,352
Scott: I'm gonna get.

11
00:00:47,372 --> 00:00:57,589
Rym: you got a spare one just in case I got a hot spare because with five drives with raid five I only have one drive redundancy and the deal with real.

12
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,242
Scott: I mean, you're not you're not super like it, you know corporate or whatever.

13
00:01:01,262 --> 00:01:14,249
Rym: You don't need you know, one drive redundancy is just fine yes, however and Yeah The reason I bought the hot the cold you want to get the most space for your money here is The drive was cheap It was actually on sale and two.

14
00:01:14,792 --> 00:01:41,645
Rym: I don't want to be in a situation where I don't think about it and then like four years from now the drives die and I got to like oh and like buy a drive on Amazon and hope I get same-day shipping and all that nonsense and also because it's a five drive array with raid five if one drive dies the chance of a second drive dying actually increases immensely because The rebuild process is actually pretty intensive across all the remaining drives.

15
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:45,942
Rym: So I want to start the rebuild Immediately like as quickly as possible.

16
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:47,652
Rym: if a drive actually dies Well, isn't?

17
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:53,912
Scott: people used to say you should buy a mix of drives that are the same capacity from different Manufacturers.

18
00:01:53,992 --> 00:01:55,800
Rym: I used to do that in the old days.

19
00:01:55,881 --> 00:01:57,026
Rym: I do not do that anymore.

20
00:01:57,146 --> 00:02:06,581
Rym: It's a pain in the ass Yep, so instead I figured this plan is just have a cold spare laying around if you do Good enough for a person in a house.

21
00:02:06,621 --> 00:02:08,550
Scott: It's beyond good enough for a person in a house.

22
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:12,392
Rym: Yeah, especially because I'm gonna put a monthly snapshot of the whole NAS on glacier Mm-hmm.

23
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:15,890
Rym: that'll cost me at most like a hundred bucks a month.

24
00:02:16,475 --> 00:02:22,380
Scott: backup of all GeekNights on S3 not even glacier costs like less than two dollars.

25
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:30,803
Rym: Yeah, dude all GeekNights with the raw Like black slash wave like a lossless masters.

26
00:02:31,405 --> 00:02:33,289
Rym: is it less than half a terabyte?

27
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,718
Rym: Yeah Anyway, yeah, this is great.

28
00:02:35,758 --> 00:02:37,403
Rym: I have nothing but good things to say about it.

29
00:02:37,544 --> 00:02:37,785
Rym: Mm-hmm.

30
00:02:38,467 --> 00:02:44,885
Scott: So I watched Die Hard yesterday cuz it's the season right and you know, there's a Christmas movie.

31
00:02:44,925 --> 00:02:46,710
Scott: Yeah, there's an ongoing argument on the internet.

32
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,689
Scott: Everybody knows it's been discussed before it'll be discussed again.

33
00:02:50,031 --> 00:02:54,005
Scott: Right that whether it is or is not a Christmas movie, but I can see both sides of that debate.

34
00:02:54,025 --> 00:02:56,115
Scott: whatever you want to say Right.

35
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:57,530
Scott: I got to tell you something.

36
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:01,450
Scott: All right, you know, I'm not gonna say, you know, we're not gonna have the argument.

37
00:03:01,551 --> 00:03:06,981
Scott: But I want to say if you haven't seen that movie recently The movie doesn't just take place during Christmas.

38
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:08,990
Scott: There is a fuck ton of Christmas in that movie.

39
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:11,790
Scott: Yeah, the end the song during the credits is let it snow.

40
00:03:11,975 --> 00:03:15,924
Scott: Yeah The opening song is Christmas and Hollis and Bruce Willis is like.

41
00:03:15,965 --> 00:03:17,089
Scott: that is Willis is like.

42
00:03:17,471 --> 00:03:19,139
Scott: I thought you plays in Christmas music.

43
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,150
Scott: I was like, this is Christmas music.

44
00:03:21,452 --> 00:03:24,650
Rym: No, the fact that it is a Christmas party is actually important.

45
00:03:25,131 --> 00:03:30,688
Scott: He takes the gun to his back with you know Christmas themed tape that he finds.

46
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:34,501
Rym: in a way He is a Kris Kringle with a machine gun coming through the chimney.

47
00:03:34,561 --> 00:03:35,945
Scott: Hey, ho ho ho.

48
00:03:36,347 --> 00:03:37,129
Scott: I have a machine.

49
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,032
Scott: now I have a machine.

50
00:03:38,213 --> 00:03:41,322
Scott: right there is Christmas and almost like every shot in the movie.

51
00:03:41,843 --> 00:03:43,689
Scott: use that for your argument pleasure.

52
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,110
Scott: now.

53
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:52,525
Rym: I would say however that gremlins Fits more into the template of a Christmas special than Die Hard does whatever.

54
00:03:52,545 --> 00:03:58,894
Rym: I haven't seen gremlins in More than a decade, however Possibly two decades.

55
00:03:59,316 --> 00:04:02,166
Rym: Yeah, I think we should watch gremlins what you tell you.

56
00:04:02,286 --> 00:04:03,410
Scott: All right, let's let's move on.

57
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:04,438
Scott: Do you see some news?

58
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:05,750
Rym: So there's a bunch of tech news.

59
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,620
Rym: We're gonna skip over all the Bitcoin stuff.

60
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:13,010
Rym: cuz you know, funnily enough I looked at slash dot right here in the poll right now is do you own Bitcoin?

61
00:04:13,431 --> 00:04:18,795
Rym: No say no because I don't own any and Most people do not own any.

62
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:21,005
Rym: but I digress don't care about Bitcoin.

63
00:04:21,024 --> 00:04:22,069
Rym: I'm gonna talk about it right now.

64
00:04:22,851 --> 00:04:33,219
Rym: the technology discussion of Bitcoin really only comes down to the power usage thing at this point and when you know the network itself all This value of it has nothing to do with technology.

65
00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:36,250
Rym: That is purely a Thursday show if we even bothered.

66
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:40,568
Rym: So yeah Scott's news, I guess I'll just introduce it.

67
00:04:41,731 --> 00:04:44,321
Rym: Another laptop manufacturer is dead to the world, right?

68
00:04:44,341 --> 00:04:55,746
Scott: So we talked about this way back that Lenovo laptops at one point shipped with some spywares Already built into them and for us that means basically even though it's only some models.

69
00:04:55,867 --> 00:04:56,870
Rym: that's burn notice, right?

70
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:00,082
Scott: We can basically never trust a Lenovo laptop ever again.

71
00:05:00,343 --> 00:05:02,030
Scott: They it's like oh you do me wrong.

72
00:05:02,151 --> 00:05:03,783
Scott: It's only one time you got to do me wrong.

73
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:04,649
Scott: You know, how do I know?

74
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:12,485
Rym: It's like if I do I know if I bought a gun and it had a malware in it Occasionally the bullet would run circular and hit me instead, right?

75
00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:13,770
Scott: It's like you fucked up one time.

76
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:18,550
Scott: It's like sure there might be other manufacturers one time you fucked up in an egregious way, right?

77
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:21,030
Scott: And it's like people like well, how do you know you can trust Dell?

78
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:23,670
Scott: It's like I don't know but I know I can't trust Lenovo.

79
00:05:24,071 --> 00:05:28,530
Rym: It's the difference between negligence and what I would term gross necklace, right?

80
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:34,490
Scott: Oh, it's like it's possible that every pot lab major laptop manufacturer is putting evil shit on their computers.

81
00:05:34,951 --> 00:05:35,513
Scott: It was hard.

82
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:42,109
Scott: it was all the ones that definitely have been caught doing so in the past in favor of the ones who have Not been caught yet.

83
00:05:42,331 --> 00:05:47,930
Rym: And frankly it is hard for me to have said never buy Lenovo again because my current life is probably still the best one.

84
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:53,227
Rym: Yeah, my current laptop is a Lenovo except for the spyware from before the spyware thing happened.

85
00:05:53,287 --> 00:05:54,853
Rym: It's now 230.

86
00:05:54,853 --> 00:05:57,965
Rym: It is such a great laptop that I bought in 2009 and it's still great.

87
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:02,302
Rym: It's my primary laptop today and I love it other than the spyware part.

88
00:06:02,322 --> 00:06:02,884
Scott: They're just fine.

89
00:06:02,984 --> 00:06:03,245
Scott: Yes.

90
00:06:03,346 --> 00:06:18,708
Scott: Anyway, it's News is that HP has been caught with a key logger built into their like Synaptics keyboard driver or whatever which is extra funny because apparently this happened in May.

91
00:06:18,788 --> 00:06:22,264
Scott: in May They got caught with a key logger built into the audio driver.

92
00:06:22,304 --> 00:06:26,370
Scott: And basically they've said Crap, those were left in there accidentally.

93
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:32,990
Scott: We were supposed to know they were in there for debugging purposes and we were supposed to remove them Which is actually kind of believable.

94
00:06:33,472 --> 00:06:38,429
Scott: Knowing how these industry works and how do you know the dev people who are in charge of making the stuff for the lattice?

95
00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:38,710
Scott: probably?

96
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,354
Scott: Work, that's probably true.

97
00:06:40,414 --> 00:06:42,099
Scott: It's a likely believable story.

98
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:45,789
Scott: Yeah, but you can't prove it, you know, I can't trust you.

99
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:49,190
Scott: now It doesn't matter whether you it's true or you put it out there maliciously.

100
00:06:51,051 --> 00:07:01,950
Rym: Trust you now here is one of the most dangerous types of vulnerabilities right because it gets raw Credentials and if you don't have two factors set up on something your apps.

101
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,698
Rym: Yep, so type in a credit card.

102
00:07:03,738 --> 00:07:06,050
Scott: do not buy any HP computer.

103
00:07:06,232 --> 00:07:08,168
Scott: And again, you know, I'm sure we've said this enough.

104
00:07:08,632 --> 00:07:13,858
Scott: Basically do not buy any pre-built computer that has the software pre-installed.

105
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:19,754
Scott: always get a computer and install the software yourself unless it is from an ultra ultra ultra Trustworthy place.

106
00:07:20,096 --> 00:07:21,442
Scott: It's hard to do that with a laptop.

107
00:07:21,663 --> 00:07:29,526
Rym: In fact, actually my Lenovo laptop I paid for a generic Windows license because that was the only way to install generic windows on it.

108
00:07:29,566 --> 00:07:34,229
Rym: because the old OEM key nonsense Yeah, and I was willing to pay that money and I'm glad I did.

109
00:07:35,151 --> 00:07:39,190
Rym: But at the same time the problem with laptops is that you can build your own computer.

110
00:07:39,733 --> 00:07:41,582
Rym: You can't really build your own laptop.

111
00:07:41,602 --> 00:07:43,070
Scott: You can but it won't be a good one.

112
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:43,652
Scott: Yeah, I did.

113
00:07:44,114 --> 00:07:46,262
Rym: you can build your own laptop in the same way.

114
00:07:46,302 --> 00:07:47,446
Rym: You can build your own phone.

115
00:07:47,527 --> 00:07:56,050
Rym: if you want to make something that is Objectively inferior to even like the most crap Oh commercial option then yeah, you can build your own laptop.

116
00:07:56,473 --> 00:07:57,318
Rym: It's gonna suck.

117
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,990
Rym: your battery is not gonna last that long.

118
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,114
Scott: I said, you know, I haven't.

119
00:08:00,134 --> 00:08:02,341
Scott: I have the Lenovo somewhere in the closet.

120
00:08:02,362 --> 00:08:02,944
Scott: haven't used it.

121
00:08:03,064 --> 00:08:04,188
Scott: iPad has just been king.

122
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:07,217
Scott: Yeah, well, I got the pro iPad though.

123
00:08:07,317 --> 00:08:11,470
Rym: I do things on my laptop regularly that require a real operating system.

124
00:08:12,032 --> 00:08:12,553
Scott: I do not.

125
00:08:12,874 --> 00:08:13,697
Rym: Yeah, I play games.

126
00:08:14,058 --> 00:08:15,723
Rym: I run premiere like I play here.

127
00:08:15,743 --> 00:08:21,245
Rym: I run the Adobe Premiere I plug a firewire mixer into audition.

128
00:08:21,426 --> 00:08:21,888
Scott: I don't do that.

129
00:08:22,028 --> 00:08:32,270
Rym: Yeah But I think I could run garage bin on here or the only laptop I think that I can say is pretty is guaranteed to have the least chance of this nonsense.

130
00:08:32,792 --> 00:08:36,246
Rym: It's kind of like if you want an Android phone and you want it to be pure you gotta buy it from Google.

131
00:08:36,688 --> 00:08:39,096
Rym: if you want A Windows laptop you want it to be pure.

132
00:08:39,116 --> 00:08:41,381
Rym: You gotta buy the surface books.

133
00:08:41,804 --> 00:08:42,044
Rym: Mm-hmm.

134
00:08:42,525 --> 00:08:45,415
Rym: Cuz Emily has one and it's great Service.

135
00:08:45,455 --> 00:08:47,301
Scott: yeah, I have a service pro at work is good.

136
00:08:47,442 --> 00:08:49,810
Rym: She has the one with the performance base has a real video card.

137
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:55,369
Scott: It's also a Dell one is apparently super expensive, but you can even choose to not have IME on it when you buy.

138
00:08:55,489 --> 00:08:56,432
Rym: Oh Interesting.

139
00:08:56,492 --> 00:09:02,349
Scott: It's super expensive like super tough industrial meant for business corporate type, you know.

140
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:09,988
Rym: and If my laptop died, I'd either get an iPad Pro or more likely I'd get a Microsoft Surface device of some kind.

141
00:09:10,309 --> 00:09:23,609
Scott: also You know, you know the Apple stuff I think is definitely trustworthy because you look at look at how much Apple goes on about protecting Your privacy and they do believe in that even though they charge you a fortune for it and even though our next news?

142
00:09:23,971 --> 00:09:26,923
Scott: Yeah, but you may want to think twice because of our next news.

143
00:09:27,224 --> 00:09:30,513
Rym: So there was a bug in OS X.

144
00:09:30,554 --> 00:09:32,040
Scott: this is old news already a couple weeks.

145
00:09:32,261 --> 00:09:34,310
Rym: Yeah, we just didn't talk about it because the schedule.

146
00:09:34,431 --> 00:09:42,068
Rym: Yeah, I'm not gonna get into the technical details of it But the gist of it was there is a root account in your OS X devices that you never know about.

147
00:09:42,128 --> 00:09:42,670
Rym: you don't use.

148
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:43,817
Rym: There's no password on it.

149
00:09:44,138 --> 00:09:52,809
Rym: It's not something you're supposed to ever log in with Because it's still Unix even though it's OS X. but yeah, right like Ubuntu like I don't know if it's still that way.

150
00:09:53,791 --> 00:10:08,370
Scott: Yeah, Ubuntu does something slightly different from other Linux distributions where there is a root account because it's Linux But they basically put a random password on that root account so that you're never using that account And instead your main account is given sudo access.

151
00:10:08,531 --> 00:10:12,169
Scott: It's now in the sudo group and that's how you're supposed to do any root type thing.

152
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,960
Rym: I think that's the right way to do it.

153
00:10:14,001 --> 00:10:15,208
Scott: I think it's not a bad idea.

154
00:10:15,228 --> 00:10:18,250
Scott: It's great I you know, I do that intentionally to other Linux machines.

155
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,536
Scott: They do not have it set that way.

156
00:10:19,797 --> 00:10:26,544
Rym: generally a server that's used by more than one person There is almost no reason any human should ever log in directly as root ever.

157
00:10:26,684 --> 00:10:28,270
Scott: Yeah, just use the sudoers file.

158
00:10:28,531 --> 00:10:29,657
Scott: Yeah, you want to know another.

159
00:10:29,677 --> 00:10:31,004
Scott: here's another pro tip for you.

160
00:10:31,024 --> 00:10:31,788
Rym: It's your sue?

161
00:10:31,808 --> 00:10:38,501
Scott: no No, so imagine you're trying to edit a file that is owned by root and you are using sudo because you're not logged in as root.

162
00:10:39,032 --> 00:10:43,310
Scott: Normally most people type in something sudo space vim space, right?

163
00:10:44,553 --> 00:10:46,142
Scott: That is mostly just fine.

164
00:10:46,323 --> 00:10:46,846
Scott: It will work.

165
00:10:46,967 --> 00:10:47,370
Scott: Of course.

166
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:52,570
Scott: However, of course what will happen is you're basically running vim as root.

167
00:10:52,911 --> 00:10:59,990
Scott: So vim has root permissions and now because it has root permissions it can edit the file Which is owned by root and save it and such.

168
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:09,962
Scott: However, this also means that vim or your other text editor of choice, but it should be vim is running as root Which means it could do other things with root permission.

169
00:11:09,982 --> 00:11:11,307
Scott: Maybe got some vim plugins.

170
00:11:11,367 --> 00:11:12,170
Scott: Who knows right?

171
00:11:12,611 --> 00:11:13,536
Scott: You don't know what it can do.

172
00:11:13,576 --> 00:11:15,444
Scott: Your text editor is not running as root.

173
00:11:15,786 --> 00:11:17,817
Scott: There is a command sudo edit.

174
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:28,546
Scott: people don't know about this command But you type sudo edit space name a file and what that will do is launch your regular old text editor Whatever your default text editor is which is vim.

175
00:11:28,586 --> 00:11:41,399
Scott: It should be And it will give it the sudo root permissions to edit the file but the text editor itself will run as your user and not as root and Thus will be much more secure.

176
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,090
Rym: So well, there's a similar thing.

177
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,009
Scott: You can learn to type sudo edits.

178
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:52,678
Scott: It was all one word sudo edit space file name instead of sudo space vim space file name and you will be Technically slightly more secure.

179
00:11:52,698 --> 00:11:53,684
Scott: It'll probably never matter.

180
00:11:53,724 --> 00:11:54,347
Scott: But hey, why not?

181
00:11:54,428 --> 00:11:54,790
Scott: It's better.

182
00:11:54,950 --> 00:12:07,650
Rym: So I will not get into the details of this because it is way too complex for this show let alone without showing you an Example, but another common example of where people think they need to be rude is when they're trying to do things like promiscuous packet capture.

183
00:12:08,792 --> 00:12:15,167
Rym: And there are ways to set up permissions in your system such that a non Root user can do that sort of.

184
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:16,337
Scott: yes You need to give.

185
00:12:16,599 --> 00:12:28,019
Scott: you need to take the necessary things and give them permissions on a group and then add your user to that group to give yourself the limited permission to access that Part, but anyway full root on Apple machines.

186
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,070
Scott: There's no password about running High Sierra the newest OS X.

187
00:12:32,331 --> 00:12:35,162
Rym: There's no password on root because you should never log in as it.

188
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:37,090
Rym: it doesn't exist as far as most Apple users.

189
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,963
Scott: yeah, if you have a brand new OS X machine you type root and press enter.

190
00:12:39,983 --> 00:12:40,626
Scott: you can't log in.

191
00:12:40,646 --> 00:12:54,184
Rym: and Basically if you type root as the login on any of these Apple devices That's that was running the latest version of OS X and you try to log in with root With that with any password or no password, it'll fail.

192
00:12:54,224 --> 00:12:57,594
Rym: if you click login as expected But what happens?

193
00:12:57,614 --> 00:12:59,661
Rym: you click login a second time?

194
00:13:00,063 --> 00:13:01,287
Scott: Well, no, it's actually.

195
00:13:01,388 --> 00:13:02,010
Scott: that's not the case.

196
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:08,350
Scott: It's only in this one specific place and the system preferences menu where you try to unlock a specific screen.

197
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:18,209
Scott: Yeah and then Because of the way it works it sort of creates the root account with no password and makes it log in able whereas previously Wasn't there Yep.

198
00:13:18,311 --> 00:13:30,097
Scott: So essentially once you see you basically go to the system preferences Right as a non root user type in some stuff push the button and now the account is created and now you can you know Fully created and now you can log in as it.

199
00:13:30,298 --> 00:13:33,790
Scott: I found you can't just do it just immediately from the login screen.

200
00:13:34,092 --> 00:13:34,715
Scott: You can only do.

201
00:13:34,735 --> 00:13:35,700
Scott: you have to do this thing.

202
00:13:36,022 --> 00:13:37,510
Scott: then you could do it from the login screen.

203
00:13:38,352 --> 00:13:38,837
Rym: So there's.

204
00:13:39,161 --> 00:13:58,352
Rym: I can't find the article again but I found one that actually went into a lot of interesting detail about like the background password files and like How this kind of bug could have been introduced because basically it's a logic error in that There's places in the back end to create accounts as a convenience for if an account doesn't exist It should.

205
00:13:58,633 --> 00:14:04,853
Rym: there's places in the back end to check if an account exists and should be used and because of the order different things Were called.

206
00:14:05,476 --> 00:14:11,079
Rym: if the account wasn't log in a bullet didn't have a password Some of the code would say oh, there's no password.

207
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,665
Rym: I guess this is a new account.

208
00:14:12,706 --> 00:14:13,689
Rym: Let's get it all set up.

209
00:14:14,191 --> 00:14:14,292
Scott: It's.

210
00:14:14,472 --> 00:14:15,375
Scott: it's one of those.

211
00:14:15,717 --> 00:14:22,127
Scott: it's one of those things that's really interesting and got a lot more press than other Vulnerabilities even though other vulnerabilities are actually much worse.

212
00:14:22,147 --> 00:14:25,842
Scott: to do this You need physical access and a normal non root log into the machine, right?

213
00:14:26,203 --> 00:14:27,909
Scott: So who has that right to your machine?

214
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:31,021
Scott: Unless you're in a corporate environments a little more serious, right?

215
00:14:31,042 --> 00:14:37,884
Scott: Yeah, but the point is that It's notable and got a lot of press because it's something that literally anyone can do.

216
00:14:37,964 --> 00:14:39,490
Scott: anyone go watch a video and do this.

217
00:14:39,571 --> 00:14:41,309
Scott: No software required no coding.

218
00:14:41,349 --> 00:14:44,200
Rym: no They were no terminals involved.

219
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,444
Scott: No, nothing you can able to do.

220
00:14:45,665 --> 00:14:46,387
Scott: anybody can do.

221
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:51,141
Scott: a child can do it once they see the video from a completely logged out machine at any time.

222
00:14:51,402 --> 00:14:53,969
Rym: and a lot of people run VNC.

223
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:56,819
Rym: Yep, and there were videos.

224
00:14:57,019 --> 00:14:59,848
Rym: the day it broke a bunch of people just started randomly.

225
00:14:59,869 --> 00:15:01,013
Scott: VNC You can remote.

226
00:15:01,093 --> 00:15:05,590
Scott: if you can remote desktop to a Mac and connect you can and get to the system preferences screen.

227
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,136
Scott: You can do this.

228
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:19,709
Rym: Yep, so This was not the first Ridiculous vulnerability in High Sierra and apparently they even like the patch They released seems to have at one point undone their previous patch to fix this.

229
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:26,890
Scott: Yeah, so like while I do believe as I said before Apple believes about you know in protecting user privacy, right?

230
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:30,930
Scott: They're in the interest of selling devices not selling your data like Google and Facebook and whatnot.

231
00:15:32,752 --> 00:15:38,655
Scott: Their software quality has been you know, not it's not just fanboys saying This like it's sort of.

232
00:15:38,755 --> 00:15:44,879
Scott: it's somewhat objective that the software quality of Apple has been Decreasing ever so slightly as of late.

233
00:15:45,040 --> 00:16:00,921
Rym: Well, I've seems I saw a great set of commentators UX people talking about how you can definitely see a point in the last several years where the UX of Apple devices has started to diverge more into Windows II Context menu II like the kinds of problems like.

234
00:16:01,242 --> 00:16:07,450
Rym: they de-simplify the experience and they're starting to have Inconsistent experiences in a way that they wouldn't have say seven years ago.

235
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:12,110
Scott: You know in other Apple news Johnny I've the famous number one designer of Apple.

236
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:19,577
Scott: Oh, yeah, he is now back, you know sort of number one in charge of designing whereas for like a couple years He was taking a little backseat now.

237
00:16:19,617 --> 00:16:20,742
Scott: He's back in the driver's seat.

238
00:16:20,822 --> 00:16:22,330
Scott: So we'll see what comes of that.

239
00:16:22,611 --> 00:16:28,628
Rym: Yep now on one hand if you have physical access to a computer you can compromise it.

240
00:16:28,728 --> 00:16:29,270
Scott: That's correct.

241
00:16:30,112 --> 00:16:36,512
Rym: You can protect the data by doing things like the true whatever the vault is in Microsoft like you can set up a window Drives.

242
00:16:36,553 --> 00:16:38,519
Rym: Yeah, you can encrypt drives protect data.

243
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,730
Rym: You cannot protect like the system itself.

244
00:16:41,891 --> 00:16:47,030
Rym: Someone could just mount volumes someone could just replace our physical security, right?

245
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:47,543
Scott: It's like you do.

246
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:52,330
Scott: Okay The computer is locked in a little vault and there's wires coming out to just a monitor as in keyboard.

247
00:16:52,551 --> 00:17:04,789
Rym: but there is but there is definitely a line that is crossed when the only thing you need is The keyboard and mouse access to a screen that the system provides.

248
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:16,790
Rym: Yep So If you have an Apple device and you don't know anything about this if you have a Mac Yeah Go update your shit and generally just take updates because you don't really have a lot of control over these guys.

249
00:17:16,971 --> 00:17:20,230
Scott: I think I also saw some people I guess before there was a fix.

250
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:23,166
Scott: They were like making a root account and setting a password on it to prevent.

251
00:17:23,469 --> 00:17:31,029
Rym: Yep It's interesting because this is the kind of problem where if this occurred in say a Linux device I feel like it would have been caught a lot sooner.

252
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:42,170
Rym: But at the same time Linux people could like people who use a Linux device would be more capable of Recognizing the why with like the password files and doing what Scott just said just add a root.

253
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,363
Rym: I had a count and add a password and now it's good.

254
00:17:44,685 --> 00:17:45,328
Rym: No one can log in.

255
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:46,353
Rym: It is.

256
00:17:46,493 --> 00:17:50,930
Rym: you cannot expect someone who has this more streamlined Apple experience to be able to do something like that in a hurry.

257
00:17:51,772 --> 00:17:58,768
Rym: And if Apple wants to be taken seriously as a Windows alternative They need to be able to stay ahead of these sorts of things.

258
00:18:04,913 --> 00:18:17,930
Rym: But anyway things Of the day, so I found this pretty fascinating Documentary, it's not like the most high production value, but it was published pretty recently and it's the story of the Atari Jaguar.

259
00:18:19,172 --> 00:18:23,810
Scott: I remember I was it must have been in like middle school and there was like a day camp or something.

260
00:18:24,012 --> 00:18:25,504
Rym: Oh did some kids say and that's 64-bit.

261
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:30,530
Scott: Yeah, that's like when the game Pro came and I was like man Atari's making the 64-bit, you know.

262
00:18:30,871 --> 00:18:34,669
Scott: And they're like, no one believe me, but I had the game Pro right there and they're holy shit.

263
00:18:35,152 --> 00:18:38,230
Rym: I was at a not summer camp, but like this other thing.

264
00:18:38,331 --> 00:18:41,030
Scott: But the thing is I looked at it and I immediately knew like that's no good.

265
00:18:41,271 --> 00:18:43,940
Rym: Yeah, well because I was trained I was raised on Nintendo.

266
00:18:44,261 --> 00:18:45,365
Rym: Sega was like tell.

267
00:18:45,405 --> 00:18:48,658
Scott: looking at the console itself I didn't even see any games and I was like, that's no good.

268
00:18:48,738 --> 00:18:50,767
Rym: I saw the controller and I was like what?

269
00:18:51,169 --> 00:18:55,705
Scott: Yeah No, nope, but then I remember despite being a kid.

270
00:18:55,725 --> 00:18:57,210
Scott: I had no desire.

271
00:18:57,311 --> 00:18:58,803
Scott: It's like if someone bought me one.

272
00:18:58,844 --> 00:19:03,350
Scott: I've been like, okay But like even as a middle school kid who fucking loved the shit out of video games.

273
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,497
Scott: I'm gonna play the same crappy video game all day.

274
00:19:05,517 --> 00:19:07,223
Scott: I did not want one.

275
00:19:07,263 --> 00:19:09,110
Scott: Like I had no desire for one whatsoever.

276
00:19:09,312 --> 00:19:10,425
Rym: So I knew that the Annie.

277
00:19:10,486 --> 00:19:14,727
Rym: as a kid I knew that the NES was an 8-bit system that the SNES was a 16-bit system.

278
00:19:15,993 --> 00:19:18,385
Rym: I did not actually know what that meant.

279
00:19:18,787 --> 00:19:26,215
Rym: when I was a child I sort of knew what it meant but not as much as I know now which is weird because I knew actually in detail how The MMC chips work.

280
00:19:26,255 --> 00:19:30,450
Rym: the memory mappers that made NES game like it made real NES games possible.

281
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:33,424
Scott: The point is but I didn't know what to write the fuck over 32.

282
00:19:33,424 --> 00:19:35,452
Scott: It went to 64.

283
00:19:35,452 --> 00:19:36,494
Rym: But I remember.

284
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:36,956
Rym: you know what.

285
00:19:36,996 --> 00:19:39,242
Scott: my computer my desktop computer, you know what.

286
00:19:39,282 --> 00:19:40,986
Scott: this iPad Pro is a 64-bit computer.

287
00:19:43,351 --> 00:19:46,421
Scott: So the Atari Jaguar also a 64-bit computer kind.

288
00:19:46,442 --> 00:19:46,622
Rym: Yep.

289
00:19:46,963 --> 00:19:48,528
Rym: So I remember big graph.

290
00:19:48,609 --> 00:20:11,770
Rym: like you I said something something Jaguar is 64-bit because I was talking to all these nerds at the Starbase thing and One of the nerds who was my age, but who knew a lot more about computers like super nerd guy He was like actually it's not really 64-bit and explained in excruciating detail Why it was not actually a quote-unquote 64-bit system and I didn't know or care.

291
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:13,034
Rym: And it was just.

292
00:20:13,275 --> 00:20:13,958
Rym: that's a memory.

293
00:20:13,998 --> 00:20:21,305
Scott: the point is the graphics on the the Jaguar produces It's computing power are significantly less than that of the PlayStation.

294
00:20:21,426 --> 00:20:22,450
Rym: It's you know what it's kind of like.

295
00:20:22,591 --> 00:20:35,530
Rym: it's kind of like how the PlayStation 1 the Atari 7800 and the Nintendo Entertainment System are On a surface view actually very comparable in terms of performance game.

296
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:41,796
Scott: If you get an NES Donkey Kong cartridge and an Atari 7800 Donkey Kong cartridge They're pretty close and they could have.

297
00:20:42,398 --> 00:20:55,777
Scott: and if you take an NES cartridge that does not use memory mappers Yeah, you can you take a Super Mario 3 or a Kirby's Adventure with the MMC 5 chip and compare that to a 7800. it looks like Elgar.

298
00:20:55,817 --> 00:21:00,250
Rym: It looks like it just kills it right because all that all that's in the cartridge That's not in the console, right?

299
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:11,816
Scott: The but the NES console on its own with no cartridge help using the most basic cartridges is at the level of you know an Atari 7800 yeah baseball or Mario one at best.

300
00:21:11,876 --> 00:21:15,590
Rym: look at any as games that before the MMC one ship.

301
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:18,358
Rym: That's not that far off from an Atari 7800.

302
00:21:18,358 --> 00:21:25,581
Scott: the ones that have the classic label on them like gyro my yeah Balloon, but yeah those NES games.

303
00:21:25,641 --> 00:21:26,825
Scott: That's what the Atari 7800 is equal to yep.

304
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:31,867
Rym: But the NES of course was actually as a platform way more capable.

305
00:21:31,927 --> 00:21:32,570
Rym: similar story.

306
00:21:32,871 --> 00:21:39,490
Rym: This is a 25-minute pretty fascinating documentary that gets into the entire story of the Atari Jaguar.

307
00:21:39,911 --> 00:21:43,100
Rym: Okay, and it's actually pretty fascinating like there's some details.

308
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,887
Rym: I didn't know some of the people involved in the early days.

309
00:21:45,907 --> 00:21:51,110
Rym: It's it's Terrifying that they were able to sell this as a good idea.

310
00:21:51,251 --> 00:21:54,510
Scott: I'm guessing I know about half the story because I read game pros so much.

311
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,529
Scott: Yeah, then, but I don't know the whole story.

312
00:21:56,891 --> 00:21:57,795
Rym: There's a similar one.

313
00:21:57,815 --> 00:22:00,868
Rym: I thought about the 3do, but I wanted to go with this one because this one is 3do.

314
00:22:01,511 --> 00:22:03,569
Scott: Yeah, I know a lot of 3do story also.

315
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:09,668
Rym: Yeah But the either taught our Jaguar was something that I wanted as a kid in the same way that I wanted an Atari.

316
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:11,253
Scott: links did Not want either one.

317
00:22:11,795 --> 00:22:14,564
Scott: so the I got also a documentary.

318
00:22:14,604 --> 00:22:15,928
Scott: someone posted this in the forum.

319
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:16,490
Scott: I forget who.

320
00:22:17,352 --> 00:22:19,688
Scott: Good job posting the good thing right good job.

321
00:22:20,474 --> 00:22:23,798
Scott: Anyway, so what this is is Something we are very familiar with.

322
00:22:23,838 --> 00:22:29,958
Scott: I'm not sure how of all the listeners are familiar with it But there was a thing on the internet called time cube.

323
00:22:31,891 --> 00:22:34,827
Rym: Time cube remember the internet used to be a much weirder place.

324
00:22:35,572 --> 00:22:38,319
Rym: It still is a weird place But in that you'd like a zombie.

325
00:22:38,339 --> 00:22:42,076
Rym: you go to a website that had something weird on it And that was not.

326
00:22:42,137 --> 00:22:44,486
Rym: that would have been the equivalent of a thing of the day back then.

327
00:22:44,567 --> 00:22:45,979
Scott: yeah like look Oh my god.

328
00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:46,729
Rym: Look at this website.

329
00:22:46,931 --> 00:22:49,261
Rym: It has an animation on it, and I don't know what it's for.

330
00:22:49,362 --> 00:22:55,249
Scott: so time cube was his crazy website That was you know notable for its like large colorful text.

331
00:22:55,771 --> 00:23:02,350
Scott: You know that looked like a really poorly made 90s website or dimensional time is a few right from Geo cities.

332
00:23:02,531 --> 00:23:04,457
Scott: And basically it was clearly.

333
00:23:04,879 --> 00:23:05,381
Scott: you know it's like.

334
00:23:05,401 --> 00:23:06,725
Scott: did someone really believe this?

335
00:23:06,786 --> 00:23:08,050
Scott: it was just a crazy website.

336
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:14,874
Rym: It had feelings of like an Illuminati type of thing like I used to think it was a joke because it read like Subgenius type stuff.

337
00:23:14,895 --> 00:23:15,757
Scott: yeah, I read it.

338
00:23:16,018 --> 00:23:16,941
Scott: You know subgenius.

339
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:20,130
Scott: actually recently the subgenius people have like revealed themselves.

340
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:25,290
Scott: Yeah, let everyone know it's a joke before it turns into a Scientology by accident before it's in a Scientology of accident.

341
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:32,093
Scott: But yeah It's like if you know this could have easily been another one of those like something someone made to be fake and the I did A fundamental idea.

342
00:23:32,534 --> 00:23:36,604
Scott: you can sort of see why someone would think this completely wrong idea.

343
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:42,943
Scott: Is that there's four Simultaneous days in one day right which is like.

344
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:45,150
Scott: obviously not true, but you think about it.

345
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:48,021
Scott: well It's always midnight somewhere right.

346
00:23:48,362 --> 00:23:50,430
Scott: and the earth you know you think about it.

347
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:55,169
Scott: You know the clock sort of has four quadrants because circle yeah, right?

348
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:56,582
Scott: Which is you know.

349
00:23:56,603 --> 00:23:57,170
Scott: so it's like?

350
00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:04,788
Scott: Oh, there's actually four days because when even though a quarter of a day has passed if we go from midnight to 6 a.m.

351
00:24:06,353 --> 00:24:08,924
Scott: Some way somewhere else on earth has gone from 6 a.m..

352
00:24:08,944 --> 00:24:14,123
Rym: To noon But Scott those cubes each have 16 quadrants within them.

353
00:24:14,204 --> 00:24:18,876
Scott: No no it has four fours Don't say 16 you say four four.

354
00:24:18,936 --> 00:24:21,945
Rym: no because four over 16 is cube divinity.

355
00:24:21,965 --> 00:24:30,050
Scott: Yeah, anyway, so The rest of the site, it's basically some crazy nonsense idea right would not have stood out today.

356
00:24:30,251 --> 00:24:31,758
Rym: But back then it was kind of like.

357
00:24:31,798 --> 00:24:34,150
Rym: it was notable for being crazier.

358
00:24:34,611 --> 00:24:39,126
Scott: Most other things you'd find on the internet and actually I can sort of see how people come to these ideas.

359
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:50,531
Scott: before I understood physics Or knew anything I had you know you have this very slim Understanding of the way things work like you see a model of an atom, and you're like hey that looks a lot like our solar System.

360
00:24:50,591 --> 00:24:51,674
Rym: I get it right.

361
00:24:51,714 --> 00:24:52,898
Rym: No you don't get it Rym.

362
00:24:53,239 --> 00:24:53,880
Rym: You're six.

363
00:24:54,261 --> 00:24:57,370
Scott: Yeah, I thought like when I was super young and stupid.

364
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:58,494
Scott: I thought well wait a minute.

365
00:24:58,856 --> 00:25:00,904
Scott: You know things get more energy right.

366
00:25:01,185 --> 00:25:02,209
Scott: temperature right.

367
00:25:02,229 --> 00:25:03,333
Scott: yeah It's more energy.

368
00:25:03,916 --> 00:25:07,270
Scott: the molecules move faster right if they get hot enough.

369
00:25:07,632 --> 00:25:10,345
Scott: They approach the speed of light, but they can't go faster than the speed of light.

370
00:25:10,546 --> 00:25:13,076
Scott: not allowed to write Oh, there's some rule that says you can't.

371
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:16,328
Scott: but my brain was like oh, I know why you can't.

372
00:25:16,589 --> 00:25:19,395
Scott: because Obviously right you go faster.

373
00:25:19,777 --> 00:25:23,890
Scott: if you go faster than the speed of light you go faster than time and you go forward in time.

374
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:29,090
Scott: That's why it looks like nothing can go faster than the speed of light because it just disappears when it gets too hot.

375
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:35,632
Rym: Logic where I was one sure that white holes exist on the other side of black holes and if you get too cold it slows Down.

376
00:25:35,793 --> 00:25:40,735
Scott: if it goes below absolute zero it goes back it it gets stuck in time And it goes backwards in time.

377
00:25:40,755 --> 00:25:45,330
Scott: if it gets even negative cold right net less than zero Kelvin's it goes backwards this time.

378
00:25:45,431 --> 00:25:51,910
Scott: That's why we think nothing can get less than absolute zero And that's what I thought when I was a kid and you can see how that makes sense to someone who knows nothing.

379
00:25:51,971 --> 00:25:54,274
Scott: I've noticed that I feel knows a little bit But knows nothing.

380
00:25:54,294 --> 00:26:03,187
Rym: smart kids today like the like the couple generations after Millennials as soon as they think that first thing in these threads of our kid logic they immediately type it into Google.

381
00:26:03,427 --> 00:26:13,862
Scott: yep, but anyway So you can see how someone with that kind of know a little bit But don't know enough, but has some sort of logic But is also mentally disturbed would think would believe in time cube.

382
00:26:14,123 --> 00:26:26,883
Scott: and actually here's a documentary about The old man with mental problems who made time cube and believed in it and one other person who also may have Probably also believed in it and the only two people who ever believed in it.

383
00:26:27,003 --> 00:26:28,528
Rym: actually I watched some of this.

384
00:26:28,548 --> 00:26:30,846
Rym: it is terrifying and fascinating.

385
00:26:30,946 --> 00:26:41,589
Scott: it is Fascinating but also a sad story of some mentally disturbed people but also a story of the internet culture and the nerd culture that surrounds these sort of things.

386
00:26:41,609 --> 00:26:43,923
Scott: and You know it's it's.

387
00:26:44,368 --> 00:26:47,660
Scott: uh It's a good story of 90s internet to know about.

388
00:26:48,262 --> 00:26:56,473
Scott: and now you'll know if you if you don't know about time cube You should watch this so that you know what other people are talking about because very often people like us will say Ah time cube.

389
00:26:56,534 --> 00:27:00,367
Scott: and just by saying time cube we can say a lot with very few words.

390
00:27:00,689 --> 00:27:01,050
Rym: in fact.

391
00:27:01,191 --> 00:27:03,682
Rym: I remember these specific instant way back.

392
00:27:03,742 --> 00:27:12,978
Rym: This is earlier like old GeekNights We went to that open everything conference and the guy who gave the closing keynote the opening keynote Whatever whatever speech.

393
00:27:13,018 --> 00:27:19,228
Rym: He gave the nut job was Great dangerously crazy and a dangerous bad person.

394
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:25,569
Rym: yes That dude like went on a crusade to remove our Wikipedia page because we talked about him.

395
00:27:25,993 --> 00:27:27,710
Scott: I don't even know how he knew that we talked about him.

396
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:31,250
Rym: But these one of those people who I think Google's for himself like I'm just never gonna mention his name again.

397
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,362
Rym: Cuz I do not want to intersect with crazy again.

398
00:27:33,523 --> 00:27:33,985
Scott: He's a crazy.

399
00:27:34,005 --> 00:27:34,850
Scott: I wonder he's alive.

400
00:27:35,132 --> 00:27:35,939
Scott: That's the kind of person.

401
00:27:35,979 --> 00:27:37,330
Scott: I would not be surprised if they're dead.

402
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:41,050
Rym: He appears to be out there like aggressively going after people who have wronged him.

403
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:45,446
Rym: So I just don't even say but he starts giving this talk and everything dangerous nut.

404
00:27:45,627 --> 00:27:50,806
Rym: we're all sitting here And we're being super quiet and everyone's just like sitting there like not saying anything.

405
00:27:50,826 --> 00:27:51,870
Rym: cuz we were play crowd.

406
00:27:52,071 --> 00:27:59,783
Scott: Well cuz the talk was supposed to be about something that was actually related to open and it started reasonable It started reasonably, but then I'm like he's not talking anything about openness.

407
00:27:59,823 --> 00:28:01,290
Scott: and then the slides.

408
00:28:01,832 --> 00:28:05,147
Scott: The the graphic design of the slides looked like he had a stroke.

409
00:28:05,469 --> 00:28:13,998
Scott: yes They looked like slides that a crazy person would make in PowerPoint the kind of slides that what's-his-face made Secretary of Defense in the early 2000s.

410
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:22,128
Rym: I wrote time cube question mark on the piece of paper I had to take notes on and I kind of held it up because Scott was sitting behind me and some other people were.

411
00:28:22,148 --> 00:28:24,850
Rym: and I hear Yeah, yeah.

412
00:28:25,332 --> 00:28:27,582
Rym: And then everyone in the room started like it's time cube.

413
00:28:27,843 --> 00:28:29,390
Rym: and then the dude left after his speech.

414
00:28:29,976 --> 00:28:31,390
Rym: And I think I we Scott I stood up.

415
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,741
Rym: We're like so was that time cube?

416
00:28:33,781 --> 00:28:37,434
Rym: and everyone's like that was time cube yeah So yeah, this.

417
00:28:38,017 --> 00:28:40,146
Rym: this is interesting in the moment.

418
00:28:40,507 --> 00:28:41,170
Rym: the book club book.

419
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:43,437
Rym: I think I have not a hundred percent decided.

420
00:28:43,457 --> 00:28:45,082
Scott: I'm pretty sure are you so indecisive.

421
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:46,708
Rym: I'm calm 99% sure.

422
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,916
Rym: I'm going to make our next book club.

423
00:28:49,117 --> 00:28:49,921
Scott: Why can't you just be 100% sure?

424
00:28:49,941 --> 00:28:50,081
Scott: fine 100%.

425
00:28:50,081 --> 00:28:50,905
Scott: it's there we go.

426
00:28:52,291 --> 00:28:53,476
Rym: It's this new translation.

427
00:28:53,516 --> 00:28:54,500
Scott: Why was that so hard?

428
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,649
Scott: What was what was the 1% you're holding out for uh?

429
00:28:58,691 --> 00:29:00,075
Scott: Okay, that's 100%.

430
00:29:00,075 --> 00:29:09,744
Rym: just give up the nature of the last decade of my career is to never Authoritatively promise anything ever because that is always a dangerous game.

431
00:29:09,764 --> 00:29:14,480
Scott: you can promise a book that is published But anyway available on the kindle.

432
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:20,043
Rym: there's this new translation of the Odyssey And I've actually been meaning for a way the Odyssey is super old Rym.

433
00:29:20,104 --> 00:29:21,589
Scott: It's ancient literally ancient.

434
00:29:21,931 --> 00:29:24,802
Scott: Well, what could we possibly get from a new translation?

435
00:29:24,822 --> 00:29:26,670
Scott: That would be different from in the previous translation.

436
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:33,690
Scott: So the thing what new thing is the humanity discovered that would somehow get the translation of the Odyssey to be more correct?

437
00:29:35,162 --> 00:29:38,849
Rym: so This translation is done by a woman.

438
00:29:39,391 --> 00:29:43,582
Rym: Okay, novel which already means that it may perhaps have a different perspective.

439
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:46,590
Scott: has any woman ever translated the Odyssey before?

440
00:29:47,554 --> 00:29:49,363
Rym: This article right here says quote first woman.

441
00:29:49,403 --> 00:29:51,553
Rym: to translate the Odyssey in English Don't don't.

442
00:29:51,593 --> 00:29:52,235
Scott: the classes is.

443
00:29:52,295 --> 00:29:56,230
Rym: Emily Wilson has given Homer's epic a radically contemporary voice, okay?

444
00:29:56,371 --> 00:29:57,075
Scott: So is there some?

445
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:59,450
Scott: perhaps it's not a super.

446
00:30:00,552 --> 00:30:03,046
Scott: You know direct translation that is literal.

447
00:30:03,087 --> 00:30:08,144
Scott: there is perhaps You know a lot of a so a good writing added of our modern times.

448
00:30:08,204 --> 00:30:21,484
Rym: the anecdote that made me extremely interested in this was around a particular the line in the beginning of the Odyssey where There is an unresolved debate as to what the word is.

449
00:30:21,504 --> 00:30:23,250
Rym: Okay, like what does it mean?

450
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:24,414
Rym: How would it have been used in that?

451
00:30:24,454 --> 00:30:26,421
Rym: like what does this sentence mean?

452
00:30:26,441 --> 00:30:28,910
Rym: Mm-hmm sing to me of the man muse?

453
00:30:30,292 --> 00:30:42,025
Rym: And it's basically tell me about a something man and people have debated apparently forever what the something is and Her translation is something no one has ever put forth before.

454
00:30:42,045 --> 00:30:44,032
Rym: Yeah the word complicated.

455
00:30:44,052 --> 00:30:50,167
Rym: hmm that intrigued me immensely because I have always had differing opinions as to whether or not.

456
00:30:50,227 --> 00:30:52,434
Scott: what were the other few things people Said it was supposed to.

457
00:30:52,595 --> 00:30:53,961
Rym: I'm not an expert on the Odyssey.

458
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:56,010
Scott: They just saw you why you made it your book club.

459
00:30:56,993 --> 00:31:00,388
Scott: The last time I read the I only know about Cyclops isn't poking him in the eye.

460
00:31:00,428 --> 00:31:01,769
Rym: last time I read the Odyssey

461
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:02,976
Scott: Sirens and not listening to him

462
00:31:03,378 --> 00:31:05,510
Rym: was in my freshman year of high school

463
00:31:05,734 --> 00:31:07,654
Scott: Not making him angry But also be him and

464
00:31:07,674 --> 00:31:25,718
Rym: I read it for class and the other translation we read was like the stodgiest Translation on earth and I remember getting shit from my teacher Because I argued that Odysseus is kind of a shithead and kind of a jerk and that he is not Necessarily the hero that we're all making him out to be.

465
00:31:26,361 --> 00:31:29,110
Rym: and my evidence was that when he gets away from the Cyclops.

466
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:35,855
Rym: he turns around starts taunting the dude and the Cyclops starts throwing rocks and kill some more of his men and I was told no shut up.

467
00:31:35,956 --> 00:31:40,313
Rym: Odysseus is the hero and I want my vengeance Mm-hmm.

468
00:31:40,915 --> 00:31:41,136
Rym: Also.

469
00:31:41,156 --> 00:31:44,690
Rym: I've just been meaning to read the Odyssey again as an adult and this is a really good excuse.

470
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:45,922
Scott: Can I just read the pop-up book?

471
00:31:46,326 --> 00:31:46,729
Scott: Do I have to?

472
00:31:47,431 --> 00:31:48,579
Rym: We should do the pop-up book.

473
00:31:48,961 --> 00:31:50,229
Scott: Can I just read the pop-up book?

474
00:31:50,872 --> 00:31:52,238
Scott: I feel like you might miss out.

475
00:31:52,479 --> 00:31:55,210
Rym: I feel like you might miss out on a complicated story.

476
00:31:55,491 --> 00:31:57,738
Scott: Can I just watch the DuckTales episodes?

477
00:31:57,779 --> 00:32:01,010
Scott: There's a two-parter of DuckTales that matches the Odyssey.

478
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:01,753
Scott: Can I watch that?

479
00:32:02,235 --> 00:32:05,910
Rym: you could watch one of the many modern movies or read one of the many modern books?

480
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:09,320
Rym: That is actually just an analogy or allegory to the Odyssey.

481
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,343
Rym: Mm-hmm.

482
00:32:10,664 --> 00:32:11,647
Rym: Yeah, I'm gonna make it that.

483
00:32:11,667 --> 00:32:12,770
Rym: I think this will be interesting.

484
00:32:13,245 --> 00:32:21,742
Rym: Okay And it'll be a salve to your wounds if you want to get away from people talking about ready player one Which will not be our book club book because I'm not willing to read it.

485
00:32:21,803 --> 00:32:23,690
Scott: Wasn't it a book club book early on?

486
00:32:23,851 --> 00:32:24,427
Scott: We didn't read it.

487
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:26,536
Scott: We definitely discussed it.

488
00:32:26,717 --> 00:32:27,721
Rym: We discussed it at length.

489
00:32:27,802 --> 00:32:29,510
Rym: I never read it because I know better.

490
00:32:30,431 --> 00:32:31,415
Rym: You read it Emily read it.

491
00:32:31,455 --> 00:32:32,057
Rym: I did not read it.

492
00:32:32,218 --> 00:32:32,700
Scott: Not reading it.

493
00:32:33,061 --> 00:32:33,222
Scott: Nope.

494
00:32:33,322 --> 00:32:35,819
Scott: I mean, I'm not you're not talking about it I'm done with.

495
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,395
Rym: it Was the fifth season.

496
00:32:39,496 --> 00:32:40,580
Rym: I've read the whole trilogy.

497
00:32:40,962 --> 00:32:41,464
Rym: it's great.

498
00:32:41,644 --> 00:32:42,227
Rym: You should read it.

499
00:32:42,267 --> 00:32:49,009
Rym: You should read it all And like I it's Evangelion mixed with Ghost in the Shell at the end and that made me really happy.

500
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:52,079
Rym: Otherwise, we got a bunch of conventions coming up.

501
00:32:52,100 --> 00:33:00,237
Rym: We're gonna be a packed south doing a panel we're gonna be at mag fest doing a bunch of panels and Yeah, we got nothing for the rest of the year.

502
00:33:00,257 --> 00:33:01,903
Rym: and then in January there's a bunch of stuff.

503
00:33:01,924 --> 00:33:02,546
Rym: Hmm.

504
00:33:02,807 --> 00:33:03,550
Rym: Follow us on YouTube.

505
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:06,436
Rym: So headphones.

506
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:08,289
Rym: Yeah, so we're gonna be very clear here.

507
00:33:09,194 --> 00:33:12,230
Rym: I guess earbuds have to be included in this conversation.

508
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,633
Scott: Okay So the thing is right.

509
00:33:13,733 --> 00:33:14,455
Rym: here's do not.

510
00:33:14,516 --> 00:33:22,130
Scott: for some reason even though headphones are something that just about everyone in You know has money even people who don't have a lot of money.

511
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:28,170
Scott: But anyone who lives in a modern society these days has most probably multiple pairs of headphones the thing everyone's got.

512
00:33:28,712 --> 00:33:31,829
Scott: Yet people are always talking about them always buying them.

513
00:33:32,131 --> 00:33:37,672
Scott: They're for sale like everywhere from the bodega to the fanciest stores pretty sure Place.

514
00:33:37,953 --> 00:33:42,570
Rym: one of the first threads ever in the original gig nights forum was like what headphones should I buy?

515
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:43,396
Scott: Yeah, there was like what.

516
00:33:43,497 --> 00:33:47,602
Scott: it's like a constant thing Like people are always talking about headphones as if they're.

517
00:33:47,722 --> 00:33:55,588
Scott: it's almost like they're a disposable thing Even though you buy one and keep them for you hope like for a long time and it's like this thing.

518
00:33:55,648 --> 00:33:56,170
Rym: Oh my god.

519
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:57,394
Rym: Yeah to July 2006.

520
00:33:57,394 --> 00:33:59,963
Rym: This is one of the first threads in the forum.

521
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:07,088
Rym: the big headphones for his earbuds debate Yep, and I made the second comment and then you made the third comment cuz there weren't that many people back then.

522
00:34:07,188 --> 00:34:15,538
Scott: anyway for some Reason my co-workers were like, you know The one of the things like my co-workers talk about is like they keep talking about headphones Like they can't get away from that discussion.

523
00:34:15,578 --> 00:34:16,181
Scott: It's like why?

524
00:34:16,643 --> 00:34:18,050
Scott: why is it that headphones?

525
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:22,788
Scott: There's one thing that should be so boring and has been like a solved problem since like the 70s or 80s.

526
00:34:24,431 --> 00:34:28,005
Scott: Why is it such a constant thing that doesn't go away people?

527
00:34:28,025 --> 00:34:29,270
Scott: there isn't like a final answer.

528
00:34:29,992 --> 00:34:31,558
Scott: So many choices.

529
00:34:31,697 --> 00:34:38,806
Rym: you might think the debate keeps going because of audiophiles and woo-woo but I found that that is the audiophile woo-woo side of the headphone.

530
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:43,422
Rym: debate is This whole other world that does not intersect with any of these conversations.

531
00:34:43,462 --> 00:34:44,063
Rym: We've been having.

532
00:34:44,164 --> 00:34:44,344
Scott: Nope.

533
00:34:44,606 --> 00:34:49,822
Rym: Not at all and It really weirds me out because literally there are only two reasons.

534
00:34:49,944 --> 00:34:51,790
Rym: I have ever bought headphones in my life.

535
00:34:52,551 --> 00:34:53,313
Rym: Reason number one.

536
00:34:53,896 --> 00:34:55,542
Rym: I do not currently own headphones.

537
00:34:55,723 --> 00:34:55,943
Scott: Yeah.

538
00:34:56,204 --> 00:34:59,720
Rym: reason number two the headphones I was using for something broke.

539
00:34:59,982 --> 00:35:00,203
Scott: Mm-hmm.

540
00:35:01,088 --> 00:35:03,318
Scott: I own The only other reason.

541
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,936

00:35:06,322 --> 00:35:11,083
Scott: I have Also three that I'm currently you have them are hanging right there.

543
00:35:11,103 --> 00:35:13,030
Scott: I have three active pairs of headphones.

544
00:35:13,131 --> 00:35:15,390
Scott: I might have some like free Apple one stuffed in a drawers.

545
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:16,816
Rym: Oh, yeah, I got a bunch of like shit.

Scott: I have three active pairs of headphones.

548
00:35:20,191 --> 00:35:21,536
Rym: Yeah, two of mine are hanging right there.

549
00:35:21,576 --> 00:35:23,724
Rym: The third ones are in this drawer right here because they're earbuds.

550
00:35:23,864 --> 00:35:27,355
Rym: Yeah, so I Guess I'll start with that.

551
00:35:27,415 --> 00:35:39,770
Rym: I have three use cases for the headphones and frankly I only wear Headphones that are big as opposed to headphones that are actually earbuds that go in my ear when I'm in my house.

552
00:35:40,392 --> 00:35:44,009
Rym: I never ever bring those kinds of headphones anywhere.

553
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:49,888
Scott: now See, I would not mind wearing those around except the prop, you know, cuz I'm just wearing them.

554
00:35:49,928 --> 00:35:50,370
Scott: It's fine.

555
00:35:51,072 --> 00:35:56,975
Scott: the problem is you take them off and you've got these big-ass bulky headphones to carry around and that's Yep, right.

556
00:35:57,016 --> 00:35:59,310
Scott: It's like standing on the subway with big headphones on.

557
00:35:59,671 --> 00:36:03,204
Scott: Okay, as soon as I get off the subway and I take them off fuck.

558
00:36:03,485 --> 00:36:08,602
Rym: but also big headphones Do not isolate sound as much as insertion.

559
00:36:08,822 --> 00:36:09,926
Scott: We'll talk about that later.

560
00:36:09,946 --> 00:36:11,491
Rym: All right, let's just talk about headphones then All right.

561
00:36:11,671 --> 00:36:15,024
Scott: So the second headphone I got I also have you know a big.

562
00:36:15,044 --> 00:36:16,590
Scott: I have a big headphone at home.

563
00:36:17,153 --> 00:36:20,270
Scott: Right that goes over my ear, right and that is a you know.

564
00:36:21,532 --> 00:36:22,636
Scott: And I have a big one at work.

565
00:36:22,716 --> 00:36:23,699
Scott: and why do I have to?

566
00:36:24,121 --> 00:36:27,978
Scott: because at work I need one that as I know It has noise canceling it at home.

567
00:36:28,018 --> 00:36:28,822
Scott: I don't so at home.

568
00:36:28,842 --> 00:36:31,820
Scott: I have one of better sound quality Yep, and I don't want to difference.

569
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,570
Scott: they're big so I don't want to carry them.

570
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:37,950
Scott: So I have one at work and one at home and then I have earbuds which I use for anywhere else.

571
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:40,368
Scott: That is not sitting at a desk that work or home.

572
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:42,377
Rym: Yep So here are my three use cases earbuds.

00:36:42,578 --> 00:36:43,723
Rym: are that anytime?

574
00:36:43,763 --> 00:36:45,230
Rym: I'm not at a desk at work or home.

575
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:47,640
Rym: Yeah at work work just provides a headset.

576
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,263
Rym: I just use that.

577
00:36:48,805 --> 00:36:49,910
Rym: I don't really listen to music at work.

578
00:36:50,293 --> 00:36:51,383
Scott: I listen to music a lot of work.

579
00:36:51,403 --> 00:36:52,190
Rym: I used to but I'm too.

580
00:36:53,292 --> 00:36:55,509
Scott: Most of my job is and I'll like watch YouTube at work.

Rym: Yeah, I'm.

582
00:36:56,994 --> 00:37:03,176
Rym: so I'm thinking about bringing a nice set of headphones into listen to music like when I have more idle work But I'm still new at this job.

583
00:37:03,217 --> 00:37:04,402
Rym: So I got too much like talking.

584
00:37:04,443 --> 00:37:06,412
Scott: when you run Spotify in a Bloomberg term I can do it.

585
00:37:07,014 --> 00:37:10,144
Rym: Well, my Bloomberg terminal is just like a regular computer.

586
00:37:10,646 --> 00:37:11,910
Rym: I can just run the software on it.

587
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:14,121
Rym: Okay, I have rude I can do whatever I want.

588
00:37:14,201 --> 00:37:15,146
Rym: I don't worry about that.

589
00:37:15,448 --> 00:37:18,578
Rym: But uh Because I yeah, I got actually Amazon music.

590
00:37:18,598 --> 00:37:21,550
Rym: like I do listen to music sometimes on the work headphones, which is not great.

591
00:37:22,294 --> 00:37:28,530
Rym: so use case number two is Headset, it's not just that I want a headphone

592
00:37:28,792 --> 00:37:29,558
Scott: It's a microphone,

593
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:39,437
Rym: but I want a microphone on it Because most there's a lot of use cases where I need to be able to listen to something and talk Usually in the context of gaming.

594
00:37:40,099 --> 00:37:42,610
Rym: I don't particularly care about the quality of the talking.

595
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:46,653
Rym: It just has to be good enough right and I want it to be USB.

596
00:37:46,974 --> 00:37:59,181
Rym: dumbest shit just works with any game and any Skype and anything and I really only use it for that purpose like it is my like normal Using a computer and I don't care that much about the quality.

597
00:37:59,221 --> 00:38:01,853
Scott: Yeah, the thing is you don't care about the quality That's fine.

598
00:38:01,893 --> 00:38:05,710
Scott: But the problem is even if you don't care about the quality, I've done a lot of research on this.

599
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:11,526
Rym: Oh, yeah, I think when I say I don't care about the quality I mean above a certain line that very things reach.

600
00:38:11,687 --> 00:38:20,926
Scott: the research I've done on this is that even if you don't care about getting you know Low-quality audio and low-quality microphone if you buy a gaming headset out there 99% garbage.

601
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:27,004
Scott: Yeah, the price of them is always ridiculous compared to what you get.

602
00:38:27,144 --> 00:38:40,895
Scott: even the expensive ones like they're good But for what you pay for them you could instead get Amazing headphones that are just headphones and a microphone and have money left over gaming headsets Pretty much or just a ripoff.

603
00:38:41,196 --> 00:38:47,769
Scott: It's like sure you're not gonna be able to get a combined microphone and headphone in one unit You know.

604
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:51,906
Scott: But are you really gonna pay one or two hundred dollars extra just to combine the two things?

605
00:38:52,187 --> 00:38:52,970
Scott: you can go a lot.

606
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:56,830
Scott: What a lot of people have been doing is going Amazon buy some great headphones.

607
00:38:56,971 --> 00:38:57,735
Scott: They're like these people.

608
00:38:57,816 --> 00:39:04,050
Scott: this headphone this Sony one is actually the one a lot of people A lot of great headphones you can buy of varying qualities and differences.

609
00:39:04,231 --> 00:39:12,696
Scott: But I get ones that have a quarter regular old jack whatever but like for like a hundred less than a hundred bucks or maybe even less than 200 right that are great.

610
00:39:12,776 --> 00:39:14,321
Scott: great for music great for everything.

611
00:39:14,642 --> 00:39:23,569
Scott: and then get like a $10 clip-on microphone To clip to the wire of the headphone because the microphone that's on a gaming headset is a crappy $10 microphone.

612
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:36,030
Scott: Anyway, so you just clip that bad boy on there and now you get two wires go in your computer one for microphone one for Headphone and now you just saved a ton of money over the gaming headset and also improved on the quality of whole bun.

613
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:46,890
Rym: No, I think most people regardless of gaming headset or not Hey USB Headset that has a microphone and speakers is probably the best UX for almost anyone using computers.

614
00:39:47,412 --> 00:40:01,070
Rym: Because the thing is they if they need a way to listen to sound they want they may listen to music but they're not gonna like freak out about the quality of the music and Head like the microphone built in most people do not have a mixer with a microphone boom.

615
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:14,233
Scott: well, there are what they do sell these days actually and a lot of people are actually way into these because You know you date even if you're not an audio file like the amps on like a sound card built into whatever your computer or Laptop is.

616
00:40:14,273 --> 00:40:16,145
Scott: Oh, yeah, probably right crap.

617
00:40:16,226 --> 00:40:18,136
Scott: Oh, right is They easily?

618
00:40:18,177 --> 00:40:19,224
Scott: it's a USB stick.

619
00:40:19,345 --> 00:40:19,889
Scott: That's tiny.

620
00:40:20,451 --> 00:40:27,235
Scott: That's basically just an amp a USB port and one or at least one headphone hole and maybe Microphone hole or not.

621
00:40:27,355 --> 00:40:37,090
Scott: and you know basically just turn your regular headphone and microphone or just headphone Into a USB one without needing some giant block of technology that comes with the gaming headset.

622
00:40:37,271 --> 00:40:41,704
Scott: Yeah, and a lot of those actually make you know sound really terrific compared to.

623
00:40:41,724 --> 00:40:43,450
Scott: you know, it's not audiophile nonsense.

624
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:50,128
Scott: It's just like oh an actual amp to drive real headphones that a sound card built into motherboard does not have.

625
00:40:50,329 --> 00:40:51,769
Rym: yep Now I get away from that.

626
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:55,552
Rym: I'll skip my third use case but for that use like for now but at the summer.

627
00:40:55,592 --> 00:41:04,015
Rym: for the third use case of my quality like headphones for the purposes of listening to music or Mastering audio or editing a video.

628
00:41:04,657 --> 00:41:08,827
Rym: I have just like studio monitor headphones that I plug directly into a mixer.

629
00:41:08,847 --> 00:41:12,390
Rym: Mm-hmm and I would not even don't have to do that.

630
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:15,125
Rym: Yes, if I if you do not have that use case if

631
00:41:15,145 --> 00:41:15,969
Scott: you're not editing audio

632
00:41:16,331 --> 00:41:22,047
Rym: Yes, or you're not the cat like if or listening to music is a specific hobby like

633
00:41:22,087 --> 00:41:24,536
Scott: you're not doing anything else You're just laying there listening music

634
00:41:24,596 --> 00:41:31,249
Rym: in which case you probably have some sort of like modern hi-fi system and you sit down Yeah in your chair close your eyes put your headphones on and listen to music for an hour.

635
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:40,890
Rym: but so I use this because I have a professional need to and I have a mixer that has all the right amps and drives and everything to where the computer has nothing to do with the quality.

636
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:52,050
Rym: But since that use case is weird the headset if you're gonna buy a headset the cheap Gaming ones are pretty much just as good as the expensive gaming ones might as well buy the cheap ones.

637
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:59,507
Rym: I did some research though And I tried cuz I bought that rig that Scott also bought and it was it had the rig it still.

638
00:41:59,547 --> 00:42:00,330
Scott: I mean it kept working.

639
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:01,073
Scott: It didn't break.

640
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:02,238
Scott: mine had a broke.

641
00:42:02,579 --> 00:42:05,190
Scott: Well, it had a bunch of good features, which is why I bought it.

642
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:05,853
Rym: So here's the deal.

643
00:42:05,893 --> 00:42:06,857
Rym: that thing was expensive.

644
00:42:06,877 --> 00:42:09,930
Scott: It wasn't that expensive, but it was definitely overpriced for what it was.

645
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:13,185
Rym: It was expensive compared to a like this gaming headset.

646
00:42:13,205 --> 00:42:14,330
Scott: It was also really comfortable.

647
00:42:14,672 --> 00:42:17,610
Rym: It was really one is really comfortable and I tried it at a pack.

648
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:19,041
Scott: So that's why I knew it was comfortable.

649
00:42:19,062 --> 00:42:19,445
Scott: cuz I try.

650
00:42:19,465 --> 00:42:26,450
Rym: yeah same It had a feature where you could plug it into your computer as two different sound cards.

651
00:42:26,651 --> 00:42:37,761
Scott: Also the main the main feature I bought it for is you plugged your phone into it And now what you could do is you could hear your phone while you're gaming and let your phone could like interrupt your game which was actually a problem I had that it solved.

652
00:42:37,781 --> 00:42:42,064
Scott: like I'm playing a game with headphones on and The phone rings or I get a text.

653
00:42:42,085 --> 00:42:42,649
Scott: I don't know.

654
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:44,495
Rym: Oh, it was three way to a three way.

655
00:42:44,515 --> 00:42:49,350
Scott: you can play music on the phone and listen to that music, right?

656
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:51,433
Scott: Music.

657
00:42:51,594 --> 00:43:02,126
Rym: so I could like be on a discord server and Doing voice comms there and mixing that with the regular game Had a bunch of cool features in this little like volume puck.

658
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:02,830
Scott: It was really great.

659
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:03,914
Rym: It wasn't durable at all.

660
00:43:03,954 --> 00:43:04,737
Rym: Like it fell apart.

661
00:43:04,778 --> 00:43:08,994
Scott: Yeah, the ear the ear cup was all put, you know a nice squishy cushion Which is why it's so comfortable.

662
00:43:09,014 --> 00:43:12,910
Scott: It just exploded in my proof mind the year and I snapped.

663
00:43:13,051 --> 00:43:17,945
Scott: I couldn't get a replacement and when I went for warranty service They were like, oh you got to basically pay like a zillion dollars for a new one.

664
00:43:17,986 --> 00:43:20,390
Rym: I was like screw you Yep, mine just snapped in to one day.

665
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:22,621
Rym: I literally put it on my head and it just so instead.

666
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:26,378
Scott: now what I have in my computer at home is I have like $10 Amazon speakers.

667
00:43:26,398 --> 00:43:34,010
Scott: Yeah, and I have like a AKG headphone that I own really only use in streaming because otherwise you use the $10 Amazon speakers.

668
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:34,097
Rym: Yep.

669
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:41,690
Rym: so when I'm when I'm streaming I either use the I use the mixer with either the microphone boom or the countryman and I just either don't listen to the sound at all.

670
00:43:42,131 --> 00:43:47,930
Scott: I used the microphone that's attached to the webcam or the microphone that I put on top of my camera.

671
00:43:48,312 --> 00:43:49,235
Rym: Oh, I could use the way.

672
00:43:49,316 --> 00:43:51,244
Rym: this webcam actually is a pretty good microphone.

673
00:43:51,264 --> 00:43:52,710
Scott: Yeah webcam microphone just fine.

674
00:43:53,095 --> 00:43:54,010
Rym: They used to not be good.

675
00:43:54,090 --> 00:44:02,250
Scott: But now the problem is if your camera and microphone are not combined into one unit They may be out of sync when you stream if you're streaming, but otherwise, what do you care?

676
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:10,492
Rym: So I went out on a limb though And when I threw away my rig because it was kind of piece of garbage and also its microphone quality was like worse than cheap gaming.

677
00:44:10,512 --> 00:44:11,421
Scott: Yeah, Oh way bad.

678
00:44:11,441 --> 00:44:15,302
Rym: So Sennheiser makes pretty good general audio stuff.

679
00:44:15,342 --> 00:44:17,250
Scott: Sennheiser headphones are very excellent.

680
00:44:17,532 --> 00:44:19,403
Rym: Sennheiser makes a gaming headset.

681
00:44:19,443 --> 00:44:20,510
Rym: That was actually pretty cheap.

682
00:44:21,431 --> 00:44:22,896
Rym: So I bought it as what.

683
00:44:23,097 --> 00:44:24,080
Rym: this was the literal.

684
00:44:24,421 --> 00:44:26,870
Rym: last time I would try buying a quote-unquote gaming headset.

685
00:44:27,474 --> 00:44:28,339
Rym: It actually works great.

686
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:28,822
Scott: It's fine.

687
00:44:29,004 --> 00:44:33,468
Rym: And the microphone is Like ten times better than the rig.

688
00:44:33,529 --> 00:44:38,762
Rym: sure It's not better than a real microphone But it's way better than any gaming heads that I've ever tried.

689
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:40,990
Rym: So I use it and it's fine.

690
00:44:40,990 --> 00:44:47,719
Scott: Yeah, and if you're just like if you're just gaming and you're not streaming your face with a camera You don't care if it's a slight out-of-sync ness.

691
00:44:47,779 --> 00:44:53,518
Scott: with your you know microphone you can have a separate microphone From the video that's on your face.

692
00:44:53,698 --> 00:44:56,690
Rym: Oh, we got a mod mic user in the chat - it'll be totally anyway.

693
00:44:56,931 --> 00:44:57,615
Scott: So let's talk.

694
00:44:57,655 --> 00:45:00,107
Scott: Here's the main decisions you have to make when buying headphones.

695
00:45:00,147 --> 00:45:06,590
Scott: Yeah Alright, so the first thing you got to decide is if you're gonna do some sort of noise cancelling or blocking or not?

696
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:07,634
Scott: Right, and there's there's.

697
00:45:07,674 --> 00:45:09,842
Scott: many says right and it's like well, why would it?

698
00:45:09,962 --> 00:45:12,070
Scott: why would you not do noise cancelling?

699
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:17,227
Scott: And the fact is if you don't have any kind of noise cancelling or blocking you're gonna get better audio quality.

700
00:45:17,287 --> 00:45:22,550
Scott: the best the best Sounding headphones are what's known as open headphones the kinds that go over your ear in a big cup.

701
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:29,117
Scott: but people standing next to you can actually kind of hear what you're listening to because the headphones are open and You'll hear sound.

702
00:45:29,137 --> 00:45:31,070
Rym: so like if I'm wearing my gaming headset playing overwatch.

703
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:32,015
Rym: It's open acoustics.

704
00:45:32,417 --> 00:45:38,130
Rym: if Emily yells something from the other room or like the doorbell rings I'll hear it which is I wanted that in my gaming headset.

705
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:42,447
Rym: Yeah, I want to be able to hear the real world but other people can hear the music you're listening to.

706
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:44,416
Scott: but that's how you Get the best audio quality.

707
00:45:44,456 --> 00:45:45,722
Scott: just that's the way acoustics work.

708
00:45:45,763 --> 00:45:47,290
Scott: if you're in a studio, right?

709
00:45:47,551 --> 00:45:48,541
Scott: You're using headphones.

710
00:45:48,602 --> 00:45:49,370
Scott: people can you know?

711
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:52,766
Scott: If the volumes loud enough people sitting next to you can sort of hear what you're listening to.

712
00:45:52,786 --> 00:45:55,262
Scott: but you're you know You're in a quiet studio room.

713
00:45:55,282 --> 00:45:58,677
Scott: It doesn't really matter You know if there's no noises coming from out interrupting.

714
00:45:58,717 --> 00:46:03,190
Rym: so closed acoustics physically block the sound to a reasonable degree.

715
00:46:03,672 --> 00:46:04,596
Rym: Now it depends.

716
00:46:04,897 --> 00:46:09,014
Rym: there's other factors, yes, they will block more sound yes But they won't sound.

717
00:46:09,054 --> 00:46:17,422
Scott: the quality of the sound won't be as good and whatever you're listening to now in terms of Actual attempts to block outside sounds there are two technologies.

718
00:46:17,783 --> 00:46:21,256
Scott: There is active noise cancelling and isolation.

719
00:46:21,276 --> 00:46:49,550
Scott: so what active noise cancelling is is This actually you need power for the headphones a battery or some other source of power USB Something and Inside the headphones will be a microphone that you don't know about and that microphone will listen to the noises of the outside world And then it will see the sound waves because the microphone that's what it does It's these sound waves and it will generate exact opposite sound waves to create a cancelling like a wave in the ocean.

720
00:46:49,651 --> 00:46:51,848
Scott: I just make the opposite wave and now the ocean is flat.

721
00:46:52,532 --> 00:46:55,222
Scott: So basically this isn't block all noise.

722
00:46:55,503 --> 00:46:59,438
Scott: if somebody says yell at you suddenly That's not sort of a constant wave.

723
00:46:59,498 --> 00:47:02,630
Scott: it can't like predict that and make an opposite wave against someone talking.

724
00:47:03,131 --> 00:47:20,215
Scott: But if there's a constant noise an air conditioner the engine in your car a lot of cars use this technology The sound of the tires against the road in your car Some sort of humming in the room, you know any sort of constant noise the sound of the the noise outside in the street in New York right that the wind.

725
00:47:20,556 --> 00:47:20,757
Scott: right.

726
00:47:21,198 --> 00:47:24,730
Scott: this will detect that noise make an opposite noise and cancel it.

727
00:47:25,011 --> 00:47:25,836
Scott: So you don't hear that.

728
00:47:25,856 --> 00:47:28,470
Scott: you only hear what you're listening to and that's active noise cancelling.

729
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:33,683
Rym: Oh, it's clever because it means that if a siren happens or someone yells at you You'll probably hear.

730
00:47:33,723 --> 00:47:35,234
Scott: you can hear it Maybe a lot of times.

731
00:47:35,274 --> 00:47:38,990
Scott: what will happen is we hear the beginning of the siren and then it'll slowly fade a little bit.

732
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:41,298
Scott: Yeah, it picks up on what's going on.

733
00:47:41,639 --> 00:47:41,900
Scott: Yeah.

734
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:44,769
Rym: Now, of course the problem with these is one power and two.

735
00:47:45,535 --> 00:47:47,734
Rym: They're not a hundred percent the power It's.

736
00:47:47,754 --> 00:47:48,449
Scott: so I have a trip.

737
00:47:48,551 --> 00:47:50,090
Scott: I have the like these Bose ones at work.

738
00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:57,109
Scott: Everyone has them and it takes one triple-a battery and I'll have to change it like once a week and I'm listening a lot At work like eight hours a day, right?

739
00:47:57,491 --> 00:48:01,321
Scott: So if you're not doing eight hours a day at work You're gonna change that battery even less than once a week.

740
00:48:01,602 --> 00:48:03,130
Scott: pretty good one and love right?

741
00:48:04,034 --> 00:48:05,269
Scott: So that's not a big problem.

742
00:48:05,953 --> 00:48:07,984
Scott: Just bring one triple-a battery with you on your trip.

743
00:48:08,024 --> 00:48:08,466
Scott: spare one.

744
00:48:08,486 --> 00:48:16,258
Rym: You'll be good to go but also they're not that consistent like that really depends on the quality of the algorithms and the Hardware in the headphones themselves.

745
00:48:16,298 --> 00:48:22,749
Scott: You can't stand next to the subway and like it'll still You'll still have to turn the volume up to be able to hear what you're listening to.

746
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:24,615
Scott: It's not super amazing.

747
00:48:24,655 --> 00:48:27,984
Scott: And also it muddies the actual music you listen to a little bit.

748
00:48:28,144 --> 00:48:28,746
Scott: Yep, right?

749
00:48:29,047 --> 00:48:31,498
Scott: It's it's not huge It doesn't sound bad.

750
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:33,050
Scott: It's just it is noticeable.

751
00:48:33,231 --> 00:48:37,166
Rym: This is why I prefer isolation because it physically blocks the outside.

752
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:38,210
Rym: sounds that you can't right.

753
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:41,570
Scott: So what isolation is is usually earbuds have isolation, right?

754
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:43,960
Scott: Do not get earbuds that are not isolating.

755
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:51,727
Scott: if you care about your hearing and you're in a loud place Because the way this works is you'd stick the earbuds in your ear and the earbuds are also earplugs.

756
00:48:52,249 --> 00:48:52,590
Scott: That's it.

757
00:48:52,831 --> 00:48:54,198
Scott: There's no technology.

758
00:48:54,258 --> 00:48:55,445
Scott: It's literally just boop.

759
00:48:55,485 --> 00:48:56,330
Scott: You plug up your ear.

760
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:58,470
Scott: So now all you can hear is what the headphones are doing.

761
00:48:58,731 --> 00:49:02,342
Scott: You can't hear the outside world because you got fucking earplugs and I found that most.

762
00:49:02,462 --> 00:49:11,589
Rym: it seems like I think these are the superior Solution but I found that there are I'd say like 20 to 30 percent of people just get freaked out by having something so deep In their ear and just can't wear them.

763
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:13,117
Scott: Well, I mean, it's not I mean in.

764
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:16,374
Scott: your doctor would basically tell you never stick anything in your ear But I think in.

765
00:49:16,414 --> 00:49:21,297
Rym: your doctor would tell you to use these over loud earbuds Like yeah, here's the thing right.

766
00:49:21,357 --> 00:49:28,630
Scott: if you go around using say the Apple default earbuds, which suck by the way Not the wireless ones, you know, and then you get the wireless one suck too.

767
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:30,359
Scott: But yeah, it's not the wireless part.

768
00:49:30,419 --> 00:49:32,490
Rym: and then you go somewhere loud like a subway, right?

769
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:35,681
Scott: You go somewhere loud like a subway or some play any place.

770
00:49:36,283 --> 00:49:37,768
Scott: a bus drives by you on the road.

771
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:38,370
Scott: You're in a city.

772
00:49:39,091 --> 00:49:43,110
Scott: What's gonna happen is you're not gonna be able to hear what the audio coming from your headphones.

773
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,256
Scott: Your natural reaction is to turn up the volume.

774
00:49:45,738 --> 00:49:46,881
Scott: But the fact is you're hearing.

775
00:49:46,921 --> 00:49:50,010
Scott: damage right is determined by decibels over time.

776
00:49:50,412 --> 00:49:54,730
Scott: So you're still hearing the bus and you're hearing the music you've made louder and it doesn't feel loud.

777
00:49:54,750 --> 00:50:00,598
Scott: It doesn't feel like it's hurting but the amount of decibels you're putting into your ear over time is Damaging your hearing.

778
00:50:00,618 --> 00:50:06,326
Scott: if you get isolation earbuds You know what as soon as I got them way back in the day like mid-2000s.

779
00:50:06,406 --> 00:50:07,230
Rym: It was like night and day.

780
00:50:07,310 --> 00:50:08,074
Rym: We got those edamote.

781
00:50:08,114 --> 00:50:14,903
Scott: I went from putting my volume on my iPod iPod That's how long ago this was at like 75% now and like anything above 25% is too loud.

782
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:18,236
Scott: It hurts in fact isolation.

783
00:50:18,256 --> 00:50:21,910
Rym: earbuds like I got some sure ones now because as much as the edamote ix are higher quality.

784
00:50:22,372 --> 00:50:26,370
Rym: They're not that durable and I've had several break on me and they kept warranty replacing them.

785
00:50:26,430 --> 00:50:26,936
Scott: They did keep.

786
00:50:26,977 --> 00:50:28,190
Scott: so here's the thing my edamote ix.

787
00:50:28,210 --> 00:50:32,347
Scott: They kept war plate replacing them for free with a warranty and they weren't very durable.

788
00:50:32,367 --> 00:50:32,950
Scott: which upset me.

789
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:39,772
Scott: You know what happened the stupid Apple thing with the adapter to go in the lightning hole because my iPhone doesn't have a hood phone Hole anymore.

790
00:50:40,033 --> 00:50:46,930
Scott: Yeah, thanks to that little adapter that little tiny wire the Etymotic jack doesn't go directly into my phone anymore.

791
00:50:47,031 --> 00:50:50,190
Scott: It goes into a little wobbly white wire that then goes into a lightning hole.

792
00:50:50,871 --> 00:51:00,743
Scott: since then the jack has not become damaged because it's not straining against this phone and The current pair of edamote ix that I have have lasted super long.

793
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:02,730
Scott: good to hear super long.

794
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:07,950
Scott: So if you have edamote ix and even if you have a phone that doesn't need a stupid lightning adapter.

795
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:13,428
Scott: Just get a tiny headphone extension cable and that will probably protect the jack on it from breaking.

796
00:51:13,689 --> 00:51:17,309
Rym: now The it's not really a drawback is something you need to be aware of.

797
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:23,930
Scott: Ideally you get headphones with a replaceable cable and now they last forever because the shows always yours are like that I can replace every piece of them.

798
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:25,999
Scott: Yeah, the cable is the plate part that's gonna break.

799
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:28,009
Rym: the shares also have a little loop that goes over the top.

800
00:51:28,029 --> 00:51:30,678
Rym: my ear That like holds them in better, but no whatever.

801
00:51:30,738 --> 00:51:31,521
Rym: but there I mean it doesn't.

802
00:51:31,541 --> 00:51:34,190
Rym: they're all use what's comfortable from a good brand.

803
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:46,615
Rym: Yeah, but what you're probably gonna want to buy if you get the those kinds of isolation earbuds is a little pass-through device that has speaker jacks on both ends and A little separate volume control.

804
00:51:47,076 --> 00:51:57,370
Rym: because if you plug edamote ix or sure isolation earbuds into like an airplane's Jack to watch a movie the lowest volume setting is painful and loud.

805
00:51:57,510 --> 00:52:01,790
Rym: Yeah, which think about how much to hearing damage you were getting if you were using regular headphones.

806
00:52:02,596 --> 00:52:03,463
Rym: So you're gonna want to get these.

807
00:52:03,705 --> 00:52:12,750
Rym: they're so cheap And you want to you I use these whenever I fly to be able to use my nice Insertion earbuds on the plane and not hear the plane noise all right, so we talked about noise cancelling.

808
00:52:12,991 --> 00:52:15,457
Scott: We talked about open versus closed right.

809
00:52:15,497 --> 00:52:20,370
Scott: the other main thing you got to decide these days in the year 2017 is wired verse wireless.

810
00:52:20,892 --> 00:52:22,859
Rym: I am not a fan of wireless headphones.

811
00:52:22,919 --> 00:52:23,782
Rym: I never have been.

812
00:52:23,802 --> 00:52:24,424
Scott: why not?

813
00:52:24,886 --> 00:52:31,610
Rym: because one When I listen to music or something I'm always next to the device that is generating the sound.

814
00:52:32,151 --> 00:52:35,526
Rym: I don't have a use case of watch a movie on the TV with headphones on.

815
00:52:35,767 --> 00:52:37,238
Scott: no definitely I don't have that use case.

816
00:52:37,258 --> 00:52:39,938
Rym: some people do that thing But I don't especially.

817
00:52:39,958 --> 00:52:40,260
Scott: you know.

818
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:43,512
Scott: that's good if you have like a family in a house And you want to watch a movie But not wake up.

819
00:52:43,553 --> 00:52:48,168
Scott: people who are maybe upstairs the only devices might want to watch on the TV and not in your tablet.

820
00:52:48,449 --> 00:52:51,653
Rym: my Headset is plugged directly into the only computer I'll ever use it on.

821
00:52:51,994 --> 00:52:56,690
Rym: my nice studio monitor headphones are plugged directly into a real audio device.

822
00:52:57,316 --> 00:52:58,730
Rym: So I have no reason to need a wireless.

823
00:52:59,472 --> 00:53:01,829
Rym: Wireless is extra complication for no benefit for me.

824
00:53:02,111 --> 00:53:07,350
Scott: So the reason I see is that the thing is I don't have any wireless headphones anymore, right?

825
00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:10,042
Scott: I did have some Bluetooth ones that work for a while.

826
00:53:10,082 --> 00:53:16,610
Scott: my previous work ones were Bluetooth And they were actually some weirdo brand no one ever heard of from on Amazon like there was like August or something.

827
00:53:17,413 --> 00:53:22,190
Scott: But I got a Bluetooth adapter for the work laptop, and I and it totally worked and sounded great.

828
00:53:22,251 --> 00:53:23,790
Scott: It was actually crazy comfortable.

829
00:53:24,472 --> 00:53:31,630
Scott: The thing was is Bluetooth is just kind of flaky and yeah, but even with an iPhone I mean some people probably might not have that experience.

830
00:53:31,730 --> 00:53:36,170
Scott: But my experience any Bluetooth using any the combination of devices is always flaky.

831
00:53:36,451 --> 00:53:41,750
Scott: There's pairing and unpairing and repairing and it doesn't just always just work.

832
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:42,575
Scott: And that's annoying.

833
00:53:42,757 --> 00:53:52,793
Scott: all right, and there was also used to be issues We're like well like as the Bluetooth profile has changed over time like the audio quality like you need compression because Bluetooth didn't have Bandwidth.

834
00:53:52,933 --> 00:53:56,270
Scott: yeah, then there wasn't stereo, and then there was stereo, and now it's even better.

835
00:53:56,351 --> 00:54:01,286
Scott: They added a different profile But you know the quality is not compared to wire.

836
00:54:01,346 --> 00:54:03,216
Scott: the quality isn't there And there's a hassle to it.

837
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:10,490
Rym: and for my phone like the other use case I didn't mention I always have my phone in my pocket within cable distance of my ears.

838
00:54:10,510 --> 00:54:14,385
Scott: Yeah, I've never had a problem with the cabling versus distance.

839
00:54:14,425 --> 00:54:15,610
Scott: That's never been an issue for me.

840
00:54:16,031 --> 00:54:20,790
Scott: It's just that even if I'm just sitting at my desk even if I'm just standing on the subway with my phone, right?

841
00:54:21,152 --> 00:54:22,258
Scott: Wires are still annoying.

842
00:54:22,579 --> 00:54:24,510
Scott: it would be nice for the wires to not be there.

843
00:54:24,550 --> 00:54:30,060
Scott: It's like the my headphone wires in the way of my mouse wire and occasionally I got like swatted away or routed around something.

844
00:54:30,541 --> 00:54:31,003
Scott: You know it's.

845
00:54:31,123 --> 00:54:38,770
Scott: I would rather the wire not be there Yeah, but of course this means I got to bring in the other hassles like dealing with Bluetooth or recharging the headphones.

846
00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:41,459
Scott: It's gonna be way more recharging than for the noise cancelling.

847
00:54:41,479 --> 00:54:44,829
Scott: you can be charging that shit every day if you got wireless headphones, right?

848
00:54:45,730 --> 00:54:51,890
Scott: however There is a new revolution in the wireless headphone, and that is the new Apple stuff.

849
00:54:52,191 --> 00:54:54,237
Scott: I just called whatever they call it right.

850
00:54:54,377 --> 00:54:58,590
Scott: Apple has a non bluetooth protocol for connecting headphones to Apple devices.

851
00:54:59,012 --> 00:55:02,109
Scott: That just works doesn't have any of the hassle and the quality is way better.

852
00:55:03,073 --> 00:55:14,507
Scott: But in order to use this I'd have to buy brand new headphones that use Apple stuff which are probably gonna be beats headphones because Apple owns beats now and Yeah, so I haven't bought those.

853
00:55:15,393 --> 00:55:19,190
Rym: So the other two questions are if you need a microphone?

854
00:55:19,592 --> 00:55:20,897
Rym: Does it need to be high quality?

855
00:55:20,937 --> 00:55:24,010
Rym: and the answer is very simple if you don't care?

856
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:25,734
Rym: Any old headset will do.

857
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:31,269
Rym: if the microphone has to be high quality you're buying a separate microphone However, you do it.

858
00:55:31,310 --> 00:55:35,847
Scott: So here's the thing is that I've noticed there's a lot of microphones on gaming headsets and stuff like that.

859
00:55:35,887 --> 00:55:39,158
Scott: in my experience I've actually not been low quality.

860
00:55:39,559 --> 00:55:41,384
Scott: They just been really fucking quiet.

861
00:55:41,605 --> 00:55:43,190
Rym: That's partly because they're low quality.

862
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:51,953
Scott: So it's like even if you turn up the volume on the recording volume all the way turn the levels up all the way Bring that noise floor all the way up Nobody can hear you.

863
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:54,561
Scott: you use the decibel boost in your sound card settings.

864
00:55:54,802 --> 00:55:57,972
Scott: people still can't hear you when you're talking on your counter Strike.

865
00:55:58,012 --> 00:56:00,729
Rym: that's just because those are shitty microphone, right?

866
00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:03,799
Scott: Really people don't need the greatest audio quality.

867
00:56:03,819 --> 00:56:06,629
Scott: if you're not recording a radio show like GeekNights the quality doesn't matter.

868
00:56:06,649 --> 00:56:11,830
Scott: as long As people can hear what you're saying you're just telling them go left or they set up us the bomb, right?

869
00:56:11,991 --> 00:56:12,838
Scott: What do you need to say?

870
00:56:12,899 --> 00:56:14,149
Scott: you just need to say what's going on?

871
00:56:14,410 --> 00:56:16,143
Scott: Yep, but you need people to hear.

872
00:56:16,163 --> 00:56:17,150
Scott: you need to be loud enough.

873
00:56:17,230 --> 00:56:25,161
Scott: So that's the thing you're gonna be looking for and for most people who are not making Singing or performing or do making sure this way.

874
00:56:25,221 --> 00:56:26,806
Rym: you want really good quality.

875
00:56:26,827 --> 00:56:28,794
Scott: just need volume So people can hear you.

876
00:56:28,974 --> 00:56:32,327
Rym: you're listen to our old episode on microphones and buy the best microphone.

877
00:56:32,428 --> 00:56:32,548
Rym: like.

878
00:56:32,568 --> 00:56:32,890
Rym: that's it.

879
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:34,576
Rym: Yeah, mod mics are pretty good.

880
00:56:34,957 --> 00:56:39,533
Rym: If you want to like stick a microphone on some good headphones tons of microphones out there It'll be just fine.

881
00:56:39,914 --> 00:56:44,008
Rym: So the other question is do you need fancy headphones or not?

882
00:56:44,048 --> 00:56:44,670
Rym: And by fancy?

883
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:45,753
Rym: I mean people.

884
00:56:45,814 --> 00:56:49,750
Rym: the audio people will often say studio headphones or monitor headphones.

885
00:56:50,232 --> 00:56:53,830
Rym: That doesn't necessarily mean that's gonna make your music sound the best.

886
00:56:54,312 --> 00:56:57,627
Rym: That means it's gonna sound the closest to the signal, right?

887
00:56:57,667 --> 00:57:02,303
Rym: So basically Yes, that is I need these headphones these monitor headphones.

888
00:57:02,664 --> 00:57:04,310
Rym: They will not make my music sound better.

889
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:09,430
Rym: They'll let me hear exactly whatever garbage I made in my signal processing pipeline.

890
00:57:09,772 --> 00:57:13,310
Rym: So I know what to change in it to make it sound better across the board.

891
00:57:13,370 --> 00:57:18,230
Scott: I see if you look at an equalizer right an equalizer You've probably seen an equalizer even if you didn't know what it is.

892
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:22,396
Scott: if you don't if you don't know what I'm talking about just Google for a picture of equalized and be like Oh that right.

893
00:57:22,678 --> 00:57:26,270
Scott: and most people on their audio devices They're lucky if you have any equalizer.

894
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:38,330
Scott: But if you do a lot of times just a bass knob and a treble knob Sometimes you actually get a full equalizer and basically all you're doing is saying Okay, the low frequency sounds are louder or quieter the high frequency sounds are louder.

895
00:57:38,671 --> 00:57:41,622
Rym: I've learned over the years that humans cannot be trusted with this power.

896
00:57:41,642 --> 00:57:44,010
Rym: No, and they make terrible decisions.

897
00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:47,863
Scott: Yes, so for example, you could take you're listening to some music.

898
00:57:48,124 --> 00:57:53,108
Scott: You could make the low sounds louder Which would make the bass no bass is going doom doom doom doom.

899
00:57:53,430 --> 00:57:55,979
Scott: You could make the bass go doom doom doom doom doom.

900
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:59,050
Scott: and now the sound where the person say there's like a little hi-hat going.

901
00:58:00,114 --> 00:58:01,163
Scott: You could make that really quiet.

902
00:58:01,203 --> 00:58:01,910
Scott: So you hear nothing like.

903
00:58:03,171 --> 00:58:04,014
Rym: This is why the audio.

904
00:58:04,094 --> 00:58:07,285
Rym: every rental car you ever rent has garbage because someone did that.

905
00:58:07,305 --> 00:58:08,229
Scott: you could do the opposite.

906
00:58:08,289 --> 00:58:11,536
Scott: and suddenly it's like doom doom doom and Right.

907
00:58:11,596 --> 00:58:12,849
Scott: That's what you do with the equalizer.

908
00:58:13,050 --> 00:58:24,810
Scott: So when you buy headphones a lot of headphones you buy these days if you buy monitors that are actually real studio monitors That's like and you don't do have any sort of equalizer between the music and the headphone.

909
00:58:25,111 --> 00:58:26,556
Scott: That's like having an equalizer.

910
00:58:26,576 --> 00:58:27,539
Scott: That is all at zero.

911
00:58:27,559 --> 00:58:28,803
Rym: It's try to have a flat.

912
00:58:28,944 --> 00:58:29,947
Scott: everything is zero.

913
00:58:30,288 --> 00:58:33,687
Scott: all of the Frequencies of sound are being played equally.

914
00:58:33,707 --> 00:58:34,850
Scott: now That's good.

915
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:39,410
Scott: If you're producing music because you need to be able to hear, you know, you want to hear a flat signal.

916
00:58:39,490 --> 00:58:43,465
Scott: But if you're listening to music for enjoyment, you don't want a flat signal.

917
00:58:43,505 --> 00:58:44,850
Scott: a flat signal has no energy.

918
00:58:44,930 --> 00:58:46,115
Scott: It has no emotion.

919
00:58:46,215 --> 00:58:46,838
Rym: It's not fun.

920
00:58:46,858 --> 00:58:47,962
Rym: It depends on the original recording.

921
00:58:48,002 --> 00:58:49,267
Rym: Let's be a little more nuanced there.

922
00:58:49,769 --> 00:58:58,370
Rym: if you understand audio, but you don't and You listen to music a flat response is also probably what you want.

923
00:58:58,691 --> 00:59:09,706
Rym: But if you Devon actually seriously for real studied and don't know like the ramifications of using an equalizer or Like what different sound ranges do in the human ear then?

924
00:59:10,910 --> 00:59:12,590
Rym: You're only gonna make it sound worse for yourself.

925
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:20,340
Scott: It also depends on the kind of music you're listening to but basically modern headphones if you buy them at the store like beats Headphones or pretty much any kind of headphone that's meant for consumers.

926
00:59:20,861 --> 00:59:23,350
Scott: It's probably got some bass boost, right?

927
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:24,559
Scott: You know, it's it.

928
00:59:24,639 --> 00:59:28,858
Scott: you know what when you listen to that It's gonna make the music sound more enjoyable for you.

929
00:59:28,879 --> 00:59:29,801
Scott: probably right.

930
00:59:30,182 --> 00:59:36,189
Rym: so it comes down to trying out the headphones that make some Like listen to the same track on ten different headphones at some headphone store.

931
00:59:36,351 --> 00:59:38,570
Rym: So I didn't go buy the ones that sounded best on Amazon.

932
00:59:38,771 --> 00:59:43,030
Scott: So it is true that some headphones sound better than others and some headphones sound different than others.

933
00:59:43,291 --> 00:59:46,966
Scott: What's not true is audiophile nonsense that the thousands out you need $1 headphones, you know.

934
00:59:48,392 --> 00:59:51,307
Rym: Yeah, I mean the most expensive headphones I've ever bought.

935
00:59:51,327 --> 00:59:55,118
Scott: you can get incredible Headphones on Amazon for like less than 100 bucks.

936
00:59:55,199 --> 00:59:56,543
Scott: They're real just for listening.

937
00:59:56,583 --> 00:59:57,185
Scott: They're terrific.

938
00:59:57,486 --> 01:00:04,350
Scott: Yeah, I'd say like 250 is the Literal upper and no headphones more than two and fifty dollars that are worth buying.

939
01:00:04,450 --> 01:00:11,540
Rym: I think like for anybody and if you think there are I Welcome you to try to explain to us what's better about them.

940
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:15,591
Scott: Yeah, like it's like some of the best headphones ever seen or 250.

941
01:00:15,591 --> 01:00:17,418
Rym: Yeah, I mean right now what am I using?

942
01:00:17,438 --> 01:00:18,583
Rym: Let me see how much these calling.

943
01:00:18,864 --> 01:00:20,430
Rym: I forget what I even paid for these things.

944
01:00:20,571 --> 01:00:25,515
Scott: Let me the ones I have at home are the are the ones that I guess they have this Sony MDR 75.

945
01:00:25,515 --> 01:00:30,534
Rym: Oh sixes Mm-hmm, right.

946
01:00:30,554 --> 01:00:31,036
Rym: Yeah, six.

947
01:00:31,578 --> 01:00:37,717
Rym: Mm-hmm your orders on Amazon 80 bucks 80 bucks, they're great.

948
01:00:37,818 --> 01:00:40,145
Rym: They're they're effectively studio monitors.

949
01:00:40,205 --> 01:00:41,208
Rym: as far as I need there.

950
01:00:41,871 --> 01:00:45,247
Rym: They have a flat response close enough to what we do to produce GeekNights.

951
01:00:45,428 --> 01:00:51,134
Scott: Yeah ignites I guess sounds okay at home for streaming and for sitting at my You know desk.

952
01:00:51,194 --> 01:00:53,325
Scott: if I don't want to use the $10 Amazon speakers.

953
01:00:53,405 --> 01:00:58,024
Scott: I have a KG K240 semi open studio headphones.

954
01:00:58,426 --> 01:01:02,424
Scott: they sound Terrific more terrific than any headphone you're ever gonna need in your life.

955
01:01:02,746 --> 01:01:05,994
Scott: and there's $67 $68 whatever.

956
01:01:06,275 --> 01:01:07,640
Rym: we paid about the same right?

957
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:08,483
Scott: It's like you.

958
01:01:08,643 --> 01:01:09,767
Scott: you're not gonna need better than that.

959
01:01:09,787 --> 01:01:10,470
Scott: I don't know who you are.

960
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:11,256
Scott: They're way comfortable.

961
01:01:11,276 --> 01:01:13,311
Scott: They're like these two big giant circles They go.

962
01:01:13,512 --> 01:01:19,410
Rym: ah, I guess the only other option is there are on ear headphones as opposed to like full-size surround the ear headphones.

963
01:01:19,471 --> 01:01:21,104
Scott: Yeah, I don't like the on ear one.

964
01:01:21,145 --> 01:01:21,669
Rym: No one does.

965
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:24,360
Scott: Surrounding the ear is so comfortable.

966
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:26,070
Scott: going on the ear is sort of awkward.

967
01:01:26,210 --> 01:01:33,418
Scott: I've never here's where I found used to be that on the ear was all you could get like there were no earbuds back in The day on the air had.

968
01:01:33,478 --> 01:01:47,879
Rym: the only uses I personally can think of are In like production rooms or in like media production where you're taking them out and putting them off a lot Or you have them on only one ear because you're listening to a feed But you're also interacting the real

969
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:48,403
Scott: world over.

970
01:01:48,463 --> 01:01:49,449
Scott: the ear ones on one ear?

971
01:01:49,489 --> 01:01:51,774
Rym: no Yeah, yeah, I've.

972
01:01:51,975 --> 01:01:52,837
Rym: so I had.

973
01:01:53,299 --> 01:01:55,325
Rym: I don't use these anymore because I don't need that kind of.

974
01:01:55,406 --> 01:02:11,089
Rym: I used to have these headphones I used in like band stuff where it had one cup over that was on ear on just my right ear and Nothing on my left ear and it just mounted on my head so I could hear stuff coming from the system While I was interacting with other people in the real world.

975
01:02:11,391 --> 01:02:15,169
Rym: Kind of like how you have one eye in a camera and then one eye looking at the world same thing.

976
01:02:16,552 --> 01:02:18,243
Rym: But I don't think you want on here.

977
01:02:18,284 --> 01:02:21,950
Rym: I feel like there's no Reasonable use case for on here in the modern era.

978
01:02:22,151 --> 01:02:22,974
Scott: I mean some people.

979
01:02:23,034 --> 01:02:28,170
Scott: if you're if you're just if you just like think on ear is more comfortable over here Then go for it, right?

980
01:02:28,310 --> 01:02:33,187
Scott: But I personally think it's like over the ear when you're sitting down and you don't need earbud.

981
01:02:33,267 --> 01:02:37,259
Scott: if you're on the go Traveling go moving around you want to carry the headphones.

982
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:43,224
Scott: you need earbud because they're small enough to just put in a pocket in Even though you might want to bring the big ones.

983
01:02:43,526 --> 01:02:44,210
Scott: It's just a hassle.

984
01:02:44,270 --> 01:02:44,752
Scott: Don't do it.

985
01:02:44,873 --> 01:02:46,560
Scott: Even though I see tons of people doing it.

986
01:02:47,022 --> 01:02:49,050
Rym: Oh and headphones that are really expensive.

987
01:02:49,151 --> 01:02:51,870
Rym: That's claimed to have a much broader frequency response.

988
01:02:53,130 --> 01:02:57,167
Rym: You probably can't hear those frequencies anyway.

989
01:02:57,529 --> 01:03:00,821
Scott: Yes Congratulations, you got headphones.

990
01:03:00,862 --> 01:03:01,525
Scott: That would be better.

991
01:03:01,646 --> 01:03:07,192
Scott: if you're a dog Yeah, but you're a human and your ear is not golden despite What.

992
01:03:07,593 --> 01:03:10,263
Rym: if you're young younger people can hear some higher frequencies.

993
01:03:10,283 --> 01:03:10,965
Scott: that is true.

994
01:03:10,985 --> 01:03:16,383
Rym: if you get above 2400 kilohertz let's say or 20 even a baby can't hear that shit.

995
01:03:16,383 --> 01:03:19,693
Rym: 20 kilohertz 24 kilohertz above that You're not gonna hear anything.

996
01:03:19,773 --> 01:03:20,154
Scott: That's right.

997
01:03:20,816 --> 01:03:21,358
Rym: And don't get it.

998
01:03:21,719 --> 01:03:25,330
Rym: Don't try to tell me about super sub harmonics or anything.

999
01:03:25,592 --> 01:03:26,946
Rym: No, cuz I'm just gonna make fun of you.

1000
01:03:27,107 --> 01:03:27,289
Scott: Yep.

1001
01:03:28,173 --> 01:03:31,866
Scott: So yeah, you know and obviously, you know, you got to consider the price.

1002
01:03:31,886 --> 01:03:32,829
Scott: right, you know.

1003
01:03:32,990 --> 01:03:34,274
Scott: just consider those factors.

1004
01:03:34,354 --> 01:03:42,414
Scott: wireless not wireless open close if it's closed and isolating or isolate or Canceling difference.

1005
01:03:42,494 --> 01:03:43,539
Scott: isolating and canceling.

1006
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:44,303
Rym: Yep, right.

1007
01:03:44,384 --> 01:03:45,690
Rym: What kind of connectors on the end?

1008
01:03:45,810 --> 01:03:48,050
Rym: Are you gonna plug it into your phone that doesn't have a headphone jack?

1009
01:03:48,350 --> 01:03:50,610
Rym: Are you gonna plug it into a real mixer with a quarter inch Jack?

1010
01:03:51,030 --> 01:03:51,412
Scott: Durability?

1011
01:03:51,472 --> 01:03:55,370
Scott: want to get one with like replaceable cables or placeable nubs this sort of thing.

1012
01:03:55,430 --> 01:03:58,270
Scott: So if they wear out you don't got to make this decision again and buy new ones.

1013
01:03:58,290 --> 01:03:59,796
Scott: You can just buy one and keep it forever.

1014
01:03:59,816 --> 01:04:02,990
Scott: just replacing parts save a lot of money if they sit on your desk.

1015
01:04:03,070 --> 01:04:05,202
Rym: I recommend having a hook or a stand of some kind.

1016
01:04:05,222 --> 01:04:06,690
Rym: that'll really increase the durability.

1017
01:04:06,790 --> 01:04:08,538
Scott: Yeah, there's actually one thing that happened to me.

1018
01:04:08,618 --> 01:04:13,947
Scott: one time has had some black headphones that squishy pads and they were just sitting on a table.

1019
01:04:13,968 --> 01:04:16,435
Scott: and Then you know I left.

1020
01:04:16,818 --> 01:04:20,036
Scott: I came back home and The Sun the window was open.

1021
01:04:20,377 --> 01:04:27,966
Scott: the Sun and hit the black headphones and slightly melted the leathery material Squishy pad and it was slightly stuck to the table.

1022
01:04:27,986 --> 01:04:28,730
Scott: That's amazing.

1023
01:04:28,910 --> 01:04:32,142
Scott: Yeah, so, you know, I guess that's not headphone specific.

1024
01:04:32,182 --> 01:04:34,450
Scott: that could happen to any you know thing like that.

1025
01:04:34,611 --> 01:04:36,047
Scott: But still something to be aware of.

1026
01:04:41,903 --> 01:04:44,440
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1027
