1
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:09,240
Scott:

2
00:00:09,255 --> 00:00:14,274
Rym: It's Thursday August 17th 2017 I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,394 --> 00:00:16,561
Rym: that was good, and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:16,581 --> 00:00:19,250
Rym: We're talking about cars that thing we don't like anymore.

5
00:00:22,211 --> 00:00:23,226
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:26,428 --> 00:00:51,476
Rym: so I come home today and I'm looking at some YouTube stats while I'm just setting stuff up and a whole bunch of our videos got flagged as not monetizable because they're not advertiser friendly mm-hmm, which Basically as far as I can read that only applies to extreme vulgarity like racism like the Sexy stuff, but and I thought oh crap the automatic filter or whatever.

7
00:00:51,517 --> 00:00:52,380
Rym: maybe we're swear too much.

8
00:00:52,842 --> 00:01:01,636
Rym: But then I went and looked at what videos were flagged mm-hmm And it's like the most random selection of like the most inoffensive possible.

9
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:06,267
Rym: like one of them is me playing overwatch Silently for like 20 minutes.

10
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,294
Scott: Yeah, you can't advertise on something.

11
00:01:08,314 --> 00:01:10,180
Scott: That's as blizzards content in it.

12
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:10,802
Rym: Oh, no, you can.

13
00:01:10,842 --> 00:01:13,653
Rym: you totally can because all my other overwatch videos weren't flagged.

14
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:14,336
Rym: just that one.

15
00:01:14,637 --> 00:01:15,782
Scott: Oh, that's an AI It's doing.

16
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:19,680
Rym: it's not a good job, so and then another one was like one of our live stream shows.

17
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,591
Scott: I was like oh how much are you making that much YouTube money on that video?

18
00:01:22,611 --> 00:01:24,760
Rym: you actually my YouTube money at this point?

19
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,770
Rym: Covers the Libsyn costs completely.

20
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:26,991
Scott: all right.

21
00:01:27,031 --> 00:01:27,977
Scott: well then dispute it.

22
00:01:28,017 --> 00:01:31,889
Scott: then Your 30 cents more YouTube money from that video.

23
00:01:31,989 --> 00:01:36,119
Rym: oh one of them one of them was a video that has one view.

24
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:38,584
Rym: That I guess.

25
00:01:38,925 --> 00:01:46,400
Rym: I guess it was one of those live streams that failed and I guess I made it unlisted But it was monetized by default, and I guess nope that video is really offensive.

26
00:01:46,862 --> 00:01:49,752
Scott: It's probably that no one wants to buy ads on a one-second video.

27
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:51,780
Rym: Oh see I thought that I thought maybe it's something like that.

28
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:58,579
Rym: But I looked at the list of things that will flag a video like this And that's not the kind of thing that flags it mm-hmm.

29
00:01:58,901 --> 00:02:04,100
Rym: It's specifically things that advertisers would be uncomfortable with not things that are not likely to be watched.

30
00:02:04,561 --> 00:02:08,816
Scott: Maybe they you know that the YouTube code that does this is not so great.

31
00:02:08,836 --> 00:02:10,100
Rym: Yeah exactly so it's interesting.

32
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,310
Rym: So I disputed a couple because it's just.

33
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:16,532
Rym: it's not like the copyright thing where I have to like Write a legally binding document and sign it.

34
00:02:16,552 --> 00:02:17,779
Rym: you click a button, and it's like okay.

35
00:02:18,622 --> 00:02:20,188
Rym: So we'll see I'm gonna poke around with that.

36
00:02:20,871 --> 00:02:28,849
Rym: I don't make care about any YouTube money, so I Ignore that it's paying for the lips in though, so I'm gonna let it keep paying for the lips in also I assume anyone smart as ad block.

37
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:29,673
Rym: It doesn't see ads.

38
00:02:29,753 --> 00:02:31,020
Scott: so I have YouTube red.

39
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:31,843
Scott: I don't see ads.

40
00:02:32,244 --> 00:02:36,780
Scott: yeah, even if I use the YouTube app on my iPad which you know has no ad blocker in it.

41
00:02:37,181 --> 00:02:41,075
Rym: Yeah, I currently do not actually pay for YouTube red because I don't watch.

42
00:02:41,616 --> 00:02:47,453
Rym: like when I watch YouTube lately It's pretty much just like videos of cockatoos doing things or DuckTales.

43
00:02:47,573 --> 00:02:55,500
Scott: I watch mostly YouTube and also Not only does it remove all ads from YouTube you also get Google Play music for free.

44
00:02:55,661 --> 00:02:56,646
Scott: So I switched to.

45
00:02:56,706 --> 00:02:57,812
Scott: I stopped paying for em.

46
00:02:57,892 --> 00:02:59,239
Scott: I was playing for Amazon music.

47
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,951
Rym: now I'm not but I pay for the Amazon music.

48
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:10,900
Scott: I use it a lot with the Sonos I stopped playing the Amazon music And I started paying for the Google music instead and now it's I'm saving money because the Google YouTube red is cheaper than Amazon music.

49
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:14,213
Rym: What I watch the most of these days is actually Netflix.

50
00:03:14,233 --> 00:03:18,363
Rym: like I've been using my Netflix a lot It's good stuff.

51
00:03:18,805 --> 00:03:19,449
Scott: Yeah, I'm wet.

52
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:21,820
Scott: It's South Park season real soon, so it's gonna be Hulu time.

53
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:25,592
Rym: Yeah, but uh so Little Witch Academia season 2 is out now.

54
00:03:25,773 --> 00:03:27,017
Scott: Yeah, I'm gonna watch it at some point.

55
00:03:27,298 --> 00:03:30,043
Rym: It's uh Real good.

56
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:34,239
Rym: I know I've watched enough to where it doesn't know that I but now I know for sure.

57
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:35,385
Scott: Oh, it is this.

58
00:03:35,445 --> 00:03:36,812
Scott: gold is real valuable.

59
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,280
Scott: this steak is delicious.

60
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,304
Rym: It might look like gold.

61
00:03:39,646 --> 00:03:42,296
Rym: what is water is real wet might be a gilded turd.

62
00:03:42,316 --> 00:03:43,180
Rym: there might be poop in there.

63
00:03:43,443 --> 00:03:44,334
Scott: Water so wet.

64
00:03:44,476 --> 00:03:46,868
Rym: Oh, man I mean everyone on earth said they're ready player.

65
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:53,448
Rym: one was gonna be the best book I'd ever read and then I Flipped through it and I learned that horrible truth.

66
00:03:53,729 --> 00:03:54,511
Scott: I read the whole book.

67
00:03:54,872 --> 00:03:55,414
Rym: I did not.

68
00:03:55,534 --> 00:03:56,798
Rym: so why did?

69
00:03:56,838 --> 00:03:57,419
Rym: why did you read it?

70
00:03:58,322 --> 00:03:59,331
Scott: I was way back in the day.

71
00:03:59,391 --> 00:04:00,218
Scott: It was like beacon day.

72
00:04:01,782 --> 00:04:04,840
Rym: So anyway, there we got a bunch of random news because it's Thursday.

73
00:04:04,941 --> 00:04:06,691
Rym: it's like, you know the lounge on GeekNights.

74
00:04:06,711 --> 00:04:13,100
Rym: talk about anything we want and This is Scott linked us to me earlier and it's just sort of an interesting idea.

75
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:19,175
Rym: I don't really want to talk about the details of this so much but the idea well I think the deal is this was a startup and they did.

76
00:04:19,195 --> 00:04:24,152
Scott: their price was $50 a month and the price went down to $50 a month is way too much.

77
00:04:24,213 --> 00:04:28,276
Scott: price went down to $10 a month and that's Like crazy for what they give you.

78
00:04:29,308 --> 00:04:37,186
Rym: Yeah But the idea is to pay like 10 bucks a month and then you can just go to the movie theater as Much as you want.

79
00:04:37,246 --> 00:04:38,252
Scott: It's like as much as you want.

80
00:04:38,292 --> 00:04:39,520
Scott: It's once a day once it.

81
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,671
Scott: Yeah, well, which is them as much as you want?

82
00:04:41,691 --> 00:04:43,380
Scott: who goes to the movies more than once in one day?

83
00:04:43,561 --> 00:04:44,063
Rym: Uh, you know who?

84
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:49,906
Rym: I can see a situation where I would do that if I were homeless Sure, I would pet.

85
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:52,500
Rym: I would might pay the $10 a month to basically be rents.

86
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:56,660
Scott: The problem is if you're homeless you want to be in a city because where there's more help for homeless people.

87
00:04:56,761 --> 00:04:59,480
Scott: But if you're in a city movie theaters more expensive.

88
00:05:00,004 --> 00:05:09,300
Rym: But if I only got to pay 10 bucks a month Then I'd sleep in the movie theater all day just shuffling between Pick the longest movie and sit in the back and every time the movie and just move to another movie.

89
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:17,839
Scott: Yeah, so that's exactly the problem with this service is it lets you go to like the big-time cinema chains And I think it was like AMC regal those places, right?

90
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,420
Scott: But I don't go to those movies ever like once a year for Star Wars.

91
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:25,138
Rym: I mean I go to them like I don't know maybe every other month.

92
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:30,920
Rym: Yeah, I usually want to go to like what we'd see at the Angelica or like and this isn't gonna let me go there.

93
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,442
Scott: just the other.

94
00:05:31,462 --> 00:05:42,519
Scott: like a week ago, I went to go see Lawrence of Arabia and 70 millimeter at the Museum of the Moving Image and It's like first of all surprised that that many people were there to see something that's four hours long.

95
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,650
Scott: Second of all, obviously this service would not have gotten me a ticket to that.

96
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:52,908
Scott: Yeah, and so it's completely worthless to me Because that's the only kind of thing I'm interested in going to the theater.

97
00:05:52,928 --> 00:06:03,097
Scott: for if something's playing in a regal or you know Major, you know cinema chain then it's gonna be streaming on a major service within like a few months.

98
00:06:03,799 --> 00:06:06,226
Scott: So you know and I'm not I don't go.

99
00:06:06,286 --> 00:06:09,299
Scott: I go to those kinds of movies once or twice a year.

100
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:15,392
Scott: and Even though it's even more important Can I sign up for this service in the month?

101
00:06:15,432 --> 00:06:17,140
Scott: I'm gonna go to the theater, right?

102
00:06:17,701 --> 00:06:23,881
Rym: So if it's ten bucks is already like less than a movie ticket to see Star Wars is $15.

103
00:06:23,881 --> 00:06:30,618
Scott: I can sign up for this in December see Star Wars then cancel before January and get $5 off my Star Wars ticket.

104
00:06:30,638 --> 00:06:34,875
Rym: Yeah The problem with this business model is it says here that movie pass.

105
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:35,498
Rym: the people will do it.

106
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:39,492
Rym: quote Will pay theaters the full price of each ticket used by subscribers.

107
00:06:39,713 --> 00:06:41,860
Scott: Yeah, they're using some VCS money to pay the difference.

108
00:06:42,091 --> 00:06:45,872
Scott: Yeah So does any more selling or selling your data to make money to make up the difference?

109
00:06:45,933 --> 00:06:47,899
Rym: does any VC want to invest in?

110
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,626
Rym: Because I promise we will.

111
00:06:50,807 --> 00:06:56,000
Scott: I promise I will not buy a tropical island and live on it with your money.

112
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:04,040
Scott: and So fast, I promise to actually incorporate a business and do something that may or may not be profit.

113
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:09,220
Rym: But like most of the time I want to go to a theater I want to go to like Nighthawk or something like the place that serves food and drink.

114
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,417
Scott: Yes, I think this gets you regular movies again.

115
00:07:11,457 --> 00:07:14,739
Rym: It also It excludes 3d and IMAX.

116
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,811
Scott: Yeah, I can't imagine this giving you the fancy 3d IMAX.

117
00:07:18,892 --> 00:07:21,840
Scott: choose your seat reclining kind of movie theater.

118
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,120
Scott: Yeah, it's gonna give you a regular old seat and regular old 2d theater.

119
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:25,963
Scott: Yeah,

120
00:07:26,143 --> 00:07:46,020
Rym: I'm basically completely uninterested in going to a movie theater unless either it has predetermined assigned seating or You know like I have to I want to pick my seat but well in advance So I can just show up right when the movie starts There's no lines not gonna get there early and sit there forever or it has to be a theater that serves like booze and food.

121
00:07:46,743 --> 00:07:51,160
Scott: Yeah, and this also isn't gonna help you out with any food or anything, which at movie theaters is expensive.

122
00:07:51,201 --> 00:07:52,719
Scott: So that's not a place you want to go often.

123
00:07:53,313 --> 00:07:53,600
Rym: Yeah.

124
00:07:54,061 --> 00:08:00,400
Scott: So I feel like this kind of service is actually already the kind of person there are people who are like so into movies.

125
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,647
Scott: They're just constantly fucking going there for them.

126
00:08:02,687 --> 00:08:06,118
Scott: This is amazing and for anyone else like it's your.

127
00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:15,767
Scott: even this Ridiculous discount where a month going to the movie 30 times in a month once a day for the price less than the price of Going once is still bad.

128
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:16,991
Rym: I mean ten bucks.

129
00:08:17,072 --> 00:08:19,620
Rym: It costs less than some streaming services.

130
00:08:20,162 --> 00:08:22,834
Scott: How many people go to the movies once a month?

131
00:08:23,397 --> 00:08:24,080
Rym: when I was a kid?

132
00:08:24,381 --> 00:08:26,148
Rym: We went to the movies like every other week.

133
00:08:26,168 --> 00:08:31,753
Rym: I mean I did not but remember back then maybe once I mean, what was my option?

134
00:08:31,793 --> 00:08:31,994
Rym: my 240p TV?

135
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:38,240
Rym: Or go to the theater, it's not like HD existed yet in homes when I was a kid.

136
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,245
Scott: Okay, maybe in high school.

137
00:08:39,265 --> 00:08:42,260
Scott: We went the most often and that was like maybe once every other month.

138
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:48,899
Rym: so In some other news you might know if you live in North America an eclipse is coming real soon.

139
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,020
Scott: It's kind of eclipse the solar or the lunar kind solar.

140
00:08:53,201 --> 00:08:56,560
Scott: This might be the pretty sure we're not gonna see another lunar one for a long-ass time.

141
00:08:56,681 --> 00:09:03,071
Rym: But the solar one is interesting cuz I don't think I've ever been in a place Where to a total solar eclipse was like nearby.

142
00:09:03,091 --> 00:09:05,640
Scott: I don't ever and my memory is worthless.

143
00:09:05,761 --> 00:09:10,853
Scott: But I do remember seeing an eclipse a solar eclipse at my house in Connecticut.

144
00:09:10,873 --> 00:09:14,294
Scott: this was Maybe just a bunch of bullshit.

145
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:18,520
Rym: the path of totality Goes like right across the middle of the u.s.

146
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,148
Rym: Like a lot of people in America like the u.s.

147
00:09:21,168 --> 00:09:25,000
Rym: Specifically can see a complete and total solar eclipse.

148
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:33,179
Rym: It's only gonna be about 50 60 percent where we are Which is fine because solar eclipse is a really weird and eerie because it's just like gets dark and animals freak out.

149
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,644
Rym: But the news is not that.

150
00:09:35,704 --> 00:09:36,426
Rym: the news is one.

151
00:09:36,968 --> 00:09:43,347
Rym: if you want to look at it, and you don't already have special glasses It's too late.

152
00:09:43,488 --> 00:09:49,119
Rym: Amazon is literally sold out Like completely and - you just make a box of the hole in it.

153
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:53,220
Rym: No, that's a shitty way to look at an eclipse who says uh me there's way better way.

154
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,678
Scott: Have you ever used the box of the hole in it?

155
00:09:54,941 --> 00:09:56,709
Rym: Have you ever used real solar eclipse glasses?

156
00:09:57,091 --> 00:09:59,040
Scott: the box of the hole in it is pretty cool solar eclipse.

157
00:09:59,503 --> 00:10:01,455
Scott: It seems lame, but actually it's pretty sweet.

158
00:10:01,576 --> 00:10:02,260
Scott: the glass is one.

159
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,930
Rym: You can see it in color instead of just a shadow and two.

160
00:10:05,231 --> 00:10:07,660
Scott: you look directly color white yellow.

161
00:10:07,921 --> 00:10:14,579
Rym: no, it actually it'll shift depending to look like orange or red and These glasses you can just look directly at the Sun.

162
00:10:15,022 --> 00:10:22,419
Scott: but well you could just get a welding glass and hold in front of your face or similar, but The problem is because the eclipse is coming through the u.s.

163
00:10:23,002 --> 00:10:24,990
Rym: There's a lot of bootleg glasses out there.

164
00:10:25,271 --> 00:10:29,726
Rym: so my warning to all of you is one don't look at the Sun.

165
00:10:29,746 --> 00:10:36,160
Rym: and that advice does not matter if Whether or not there is an eclipse because the Sun will fuck up your eyes.

166
00:10:36,522 --> 00:10:39,040
Rym: And if there's an eclipse it fucks them up just as fast.

167
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,924
Rym: But it doesn't hurt.

168
00:10:39,944 --> 00:10:40,929
Rym: so you won't realize it.

169
00:10:41,331 --> 00:10:44,485
Rym: you could look straight at the Sun to think wow that's cool You're gonna blind yourself.

170
00:10:44,505 --> 00:10:53,394
Rym:  if you look through your eclipse glasses Anything other than the Sun and you can see anything your eclipse glasses are fake.

171
00:10:54,216 --> 00:10:55,700
Rym: There's a lot of bootlegs out there.

172
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,785
Rym: Yep eclipse.

173
00:10:58,327 --> 00:11:03,380
Rym: uh the other reason I bring this up is literally the other day I'm sitting at work, and I said something something eclipse.

174
00:11:04,521 --> 00:11:07,840
Rym: No one knew an eclipse was coming like no one.

175
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,892
Scott: I've just seen news about the eclipse for like six months.

176
00:11:11,032 --> 00:11:16,020
Scott: every day for like a few weeks now There's news about the eclipse in some feed somewhere.

177
00:11:16,455 --> 00:11:20,331
Rym: Yeah I Realized there's a ton of people who just do not like.

178
00:11:20,351 --> 00:11:23,723
Scott: compared to the last time there was an eclipse people are way high on This eclipse.

179
00:11:23,964 --> 00:11:30,050
Rym: I mean imagine the person in like Tennessee because looks like he's gonna right through, Tennessee Who's just like sitting in their yard drinking a beer.

180
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:30,552
Rym: they don't know.

181
00:11:30,572 --> 00:11:32,219
Rym: and then the Sun just goes out.

182
00:11:32,923 --> 00:11:34,679
Scott: How about the caveman back in the day?

183
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,165
Scott: The Sun would just go out.

184
00:11:37,547 --> 00:11:38,994
Rym: Oh dogs found religion.

185
00:11:39,356 --> 00:11:40,100
Rym: call the cops.

186
00:11:41,681 --> 00:11:43,029
Scott: So don't look at the Sun.

187
00:11:43,089 --> 00:11:44,638
Scott: why do you need to be told not to look at?

188
00:11:44,658 --> 00:11:47,049
Rym: yeah I feel like 2017 told me that there's a.

189
00:11:47,209 --> 00:11:51,263
Scott: it's like don't poop your pants unless you're a small Small.

190
00:11:51,363 --> 00:11:55,000
Scott: look directly at the Sun unless you're a small child who doesn't know better.

191
00:11:55,241 --> 00:12:03,135
Scott: You know you don't need to be told not to look at the Sun and by the way if you have children Do not let them be outside alone during the Eclipse because they will look at the Sun.

192
00:12:03,175 --> 00:12:03,797
Scott: look at the Sun.

193
00:12:05,743 --> 00:12:10,675
Rym: But like seriously if you have kids Don't let them be outside alone during the Eclipse.

194
00:12:10,736 --> 00:12:14,249
Rym: like I'm serious They will look at the Sun and fuck up their eyes also.

195
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:17,440
Rym: Maybe your dog will - oh no animals get freaked out by it.

196
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,123
Rym: They don't look at the Sun.

197
00:12:18,143 --> 00:12:18,887
Rym: They usually run away.

198
00:12:19,148 --> 00:12:21,400
Scott: You never know can't hurt to keep them indoors.

199
00:12:21,881 --> 00:12:23,185
Rym: So you got any news yourself.

200
00:12:23,526 --> 00:12:24,609
Scott: do I have a news?

201
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,014
Rym: that is I pulled it up already.

202
00:12:26,054 --> 00:12:26,555
Rym: It's this thing.

203
00:12:27,177 --> 00:12:40,080
Scott: Oh, yeah, right, so You know when you're looking for a job, and you're not looking in Europe or something where they have reasonable mandatory vacation plans Mandated by the government of like 40 some days or some shit right in the u.s.

204
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,627
Scott: You get almost no vacation days.

205
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:44,823
Scott: if you're you're pretty much less than every other Civilized country.

206
00:12:44,863 --> 00:12:48,554
Rym: if you're lucky like a like the best you're gonna get in a normal company in the u.s.

207
00:12:48,655 --> 00:12:52,549
Rym: Is 20 days plus Holidays plus unlimited sick days.

208
00:12:52,589 --> 00:12:53,453
Rym: That's like the best deal.

209
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:53,936
Rym: You're gonna get.

210
00:12:53,976 --> 00:12:59,237
Rym: it's like a good deal And if you work there for 10 years or 20 years us like you'll get 20 you'll get 25 days.

211
00:13:00,941 --> 00:13:08,880
Scott: Anyway, so a lot did you always read a story about like oh this place actually people everyone telecommutes everyone works from home.

212
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,720
Scott: They actually have unlimited vacation.

213
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,225
Scott: they actually you know.

214
00:13:12,285 --> 00:13:14,271
Scott: and the thing is first of all unlimited vacation is bullshit.

215
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:20,889
Scott: because what happens with the limited vacation in reality is People end up like not afraid to use it.

216
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:24,640
Scott: and also some people are competitive like I gotta outwork the other people.

217
00:13:24,761 --> 00:13:25,928
Scott: I know you end up.

218
00:13:26,089 --> 00:13:27,760
Scott: It's like you think I'll have a limited vacation.

219
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,609
Scott: That means I could just like go to tropical island for a month.

220
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,252
Scott: No one does.

221
00:13:31,813 --> 00:13:33,780
Scott: All right, so unlimited vacations bullshit.

222
00:13:33,961 --> 00:13:35,124
Rym: I would say it's only bullshit.

223
00:13:35,144 --> 00:13:40,000
Rym: because of poor management a well-run company people would use that vacation and the company would still make money.

224
00:13:40,181 --> 00:13:40,562
Scott: It's never.

225
00:13:40,823 --> 00:13:45,100
Scott: apparently the evidence is that when you have unlimited vacation policies people just don't use them.

226
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,532
Scott: Yeah They'll use like less days than if you gave them a set number of days.

227
00:13:48,572 --> 00:13:51,866
Rym: and then there's probably another class of person who literally just Never comes to the office again.

228
00:13:51,886 --> 00:13:54,319
Scott: Yeah, that's me and then you get fired anyway.

229
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:59,580
Scott: So, you know and you can never act when you're looking for a job you can never actually find any of these places.

230
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,049
Scott: I think they just made up places for our articles.

231
00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:03,253
Scott: They're never hiring anyone.

232
00:14:03,273 --> 00:14:05,080
Scott: These companies have like five employees.

233
00:14:05,501 --> 00:14:09,614
Scott: But anyway, here's a story that I assume is about a made-up company and isn't real.

234
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:15,113
Rym: but here as supposedly this Mandatory vacation is not that there are places to do that.

235
00:14:15,153 --> 00:14:17,040
Rym: I've worked with people who worked in places like that.

236
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,012
Scott: Well, how come they're not hiring?

237
00:14:18,052 --> 00:14:18,579
Scott: Let me work there.

238
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:22,334
Rym: So it's a lot of Wall Street companies and the rationale some.

239
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:23,660
Rym: sometimes it's a compliance thing.

240
00:14:24,762 --> 00:14:30,500
Rym: If a trader like you think about a truck driver truck driver gets tired because they work too hard They fall asleep at the wheel they can cause serious damage.

241
00:14:30,781 --> 00:14:31,565
Rym: So there's laws.

242
00:14:31,786 --> 00:14:38,254
Rym: you can only drive so much in a day and in a week and all that stuff For certain kinds of trading jobs same deal.

243
00:14:38,556 --> 00:14:39,660
Rym: You can't get overwork.

244
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,832
Rym: You've got to take certain amount of vacation a year and you're not like.

245
00:14:43,153 --> 00:14:47,613
Rym: some of these places will literally like you have to leave Your blackberry at work and they lock your account out.

246
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,020
Rym: You can't check working map, right?

247
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,528
Scott: So here's what this place does supposedly right.

248
00:14:51,989 --> 00:14:53,875
Scott: whatever company this is is the way they did.

249
00:14:53,895 --> 00:14:58,892
Scott: the mandatory vacation as they said It wasn't even like you must take this many days.

250
00:14:58,912 --> 00:15:01,280
Scott: It was every X the week.

251
00:15:01,341 --> 00:15:02,519
Scott: I think it was seven or eight weeks.

252
00:15:03,004 --> 00:15:04,559
Scott: You must take a week off like that.

253
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,680
Scott: It's you only work for that number of weeks and then they schedule in advance like this week.

254
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,684
Scott: You're not working this week.

255
00:15:09,704 --> 00:15:10,567
Scott: You're not working this week.

256
00:15:10,587 --> 00:15:14,240
Scott: You're not working and then and so you're forced to not work those weeks.

257
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:18,820
Scott: But wait, what if that person just like, you know, like you said goes to tries to check their work email?

258
00:15:19,462 --> 00:15:23,780
Scott: They got something even better than turning off your blackberry or leaving it at work.

259
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:32,920
Scott: Yeah, right if you check a work email or do anything like that You don't get paid for that vacation week And you just don't get it.

260
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:43,979
Scott: So you're like afraid to do and to even call into work or go to the office or anything because that's gonna cost you Presumably a lot of money hundreds or even thousand dollars and who knows how much you get paid, right?

261
00:15:43,979 --> 00:15:47,367
Scott: 150 second, you know your salary divided by 52.

262
00:15:47,367 --> 00:15:51,760
Scott: It's still a lot of freaking money for pretty much anyone, right?

263
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,187
Scott: It's just because percentage based right?

264
00:15:53,207 --> 00:15:57,627
Scott: It's a week of work no matter how much money you make so you don't want to lose that.

265
00:15:58,352 --> 00:16:02,734
Scott: so this is pretty great and Company wherever you are hiring me.

266
00:16:02,774 --> 00:16:03,340
Scott: I have skills.

267
00:16:03,423 --> 00:16:21,926
Scott: well I mean if anyone knows any companies that are actual companies that are actually like this that are hiring and aren't just made up companies to write articles about because I have not once in My entire life actually seen like a job post at any company with any sort of remote working or you know mandatory Vacation or any of these things.

268
00:16:21,987 --> 00:16:26,768
Scott: or you know work whenever you work the number of hours You need to work whatever however many that is.

269
00:16:26,808 --> 00:16:29,320
Scott: I've never actually seen a real place that does that.

270
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,387
Scott: I've only seen articles talking about this bullshit.

271
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:36,203
Scott: If anyone knows a real place that does that point me at it So tangentially.

272
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:41,480
Rym: I've worked at many places that have the the similar but related concept of unlimited sick days.

273
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,070
Scott: I have I have don't.

274
00:16:43,111 --> 00:16:44,903
Scott: I don't have unlimited sick days But I have.

275
00:16:45,265 --> 00:16:47,759
Scott: the sick days unlike the vacation days don't reset every year.

276
00:16:48,643 --> 00:16:50,452
Scott: So I have like a zillion sick days.

277
00:16:50,492 --> 00:16:50,975
Scott: That's cool.

278
00:16:51,115 --> 00:16:58,796
Rym: If I got way sick unlimited if you're an employer is better because one no one's gonna come into the office and get everybody sick.

279
00:16:59,017 --> 00:17:06,520
Rym: mm-hmm and two People aren't just going to use all the sick days you give them every year as vacation days because they don't get it on vacation.

280
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:10,720
Rym: So people will take real vacations because they won't be afraid of wasting their days.

281
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,079
Rym: I'm sick, and they'll stay home when they have the flu.

282
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:14,327
Rym: I cannot.

283
00:17:14,387 --> 00:17:18,688
Rym: it is it was it's night and day the places I work that did that and the places I work that didn't.

284
00:17:18,989 --> 00:17:21,559
Rym: and how often the entire office would get sick mm-hmm.

285
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:23,478
Rym: So there's some other news.

286
00:17:24,345 --> 00:17:29,691
Rym: You know Millennials are killing everything and I'm gonna go to in depth in this But there's a really funny set of sentences all the every time.

287
00:17:29,711 --> 00:17:31,176
Scott: you know you mean that's always like.

288
00:17:31,196 --> 00:17:32,280
Scott: that's like a meme these days.

289
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,852
Scott: Oh my god Millennials are killing whatever, but you know what?

290
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,382
Scott: anything I've seen Anything.

291
00:17:37,422 --> 00:17:45,448
Scott: I've seen either a parody or a real article saying Millennials are killing X. now X is always something I want to die perfectly.

292
00:17:45,569 --> 00:17:51,440
Scott: I've never seen someone write like oh Millennials are killing something that Scott wants to stick around.

293
00:17:52,442 --> 00:17:57,451
Scott: Like Millennials are killing all the pretty fishies or yeah Killing all the delicious fruits.

294
00:17:59,644 --> 00:18:06,631
Scott: I've never seen any article fake or real saying that it's always Millennials are killing X. and whether it's a parody article or a real article.

295
00:18:07,072 --> 00:18:09,660
Scott: It's always like yeah kill X fuck X yeah.

296
00:18:10,531 --> 00:18:18,320
Scott: so Applebee's if you're not aware kill Applebee's fuck him if you don't live in the u.s We ate there a lot in college days, but the garbage yeah.

297
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,832
Scott: But you know why we ate there a lot cuz one.

298
00:18:19,852 --> 00:18:20,860
Scott: that's where people went.

299
00:18:20,921 --> 00:18:22,563
Scott: We didn't have money And there was nowhere else to go.

300
00:18:22,724 --> 00:18:32,087
Rym: when we went that Applebee's had a policy where they would sell all their Appetizers half-off after like 10 o'clock at night I mean this like weeknight, and we were po.

301
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:40,019
Rym: so we would go there and as a group probably order like 17 or 18 appetizers and no actual food.

302
00:18:41,481 --> 00:18:44,299
Rym: But Applebee's is not a restaurant so much as a microwave.

303
00:18:45,345 --> 00:18:48,279
Rym: They just have bags of food that they microwave and bring to you like it.

304
00:18:49,681 --> 00:18:51,073
Rym: Don't look into how Applebee's works.

305
00:18:51,093 --> 00:18:51,880
Rym: You'll feel real bad.

306
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,047
Scott: I mean all those restaurants pretty much work the same way.

307
00:18:54,087 --> 00:18:57,618
Scott: the food is largely to a great extent pre-prepared.

308
00:18:57,658 --> 00:18:58,280
Scott: difference between.

309
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,519
Scott: There's not any real chefs back there.

310
00:19:00,641 --> 00:19:01,670
Scott: It's you know it's based on.

311
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:13,720
Scott: usually there's centralized Chefing warehouses that pre make the food and ship it to the restaurants already ready right and the people at the restaurants are basically not Any more skilled than say fast-food workers who just assemble the food following instructions.

312
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,990
Scott: It's a little more complicated than putting together McDonald's burger, but not much.

313
00:19:17,271 --> 00:19:19,980
Rym: Yeah, it's less complicated than like a blue apron.

314
00:19:20,321 --> 00:19:26,220
Rym: Yeah, that's why they're the only difference between like Applebee's TGI Fridays, Ruby Tuesday.

315
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,364
Scott: They're all the same restaurant.

316
00:19:27,384 --> 00:19:29,431
Scott: as far as I'm concerned there the branding is different.

317
00:19:29,913 --> 00:19:31,900
Rym: the demographic they go after is different.

318
00:19:32,061 --> 00:19:32,905
Scott: They're owned by different.

319
00:19:32,925 --> 00:19:34,352
Scott: some of them are owned by different companies.

320
00:19:34,372 --> 00:19:42,626
Scott: some of them are owned by the same company But they're all basically the same food with different menus different styles But the same damn thing.

321
00:19:42,646 --> 00:19:46,480
Rym: so Applebee's is like shutting a hundred and like a ton of stores and consolidation.

322
00:19:47,641 --> 00:19:50,853
Rym: Apparently the same company owns I hop and I have to not doing well either.

323
00:19:50,994 --> 00:19:52,460
Scott: I hop has never been doing well.

324
00:19:52,581 --> 00:19:58,109
Scott: He was like you know when I was young and like I the best Menu is fistfights like when I was a kid.

325
00:19:58,149 --> 00:19:59,052
Scott: I really wanted to go to.

326
00:19:59,133 --> 00:19:59,434
Rym: I have.

327
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:00,337
Scott: I was like I'm.

328
00:20:00,377 --> 00:20:01,060
Scott: I got pancakes.

329
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:01,684
Scott: I'm gonna win.

330
00:20:01,704 --> 00:20:04,099
Rym: the one came by RIT and we were like oh shit hard.

331
00:20:04,501 --> 00:20:09,640
Scott: It was hard to find I hop because they were always going out of business and not doing well even when I was very young.

332
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,377
Scott: Yeah, I'd go to diners and shit instead.

333
00:20:11,397 --> 00:20:13,630
Rym: well I remember we wouldn't go to I hops cuz.

334
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,479
Rym: people were like yeah, they'll be fistfights cuz.

335
00:20:15,499 --> 00:20:16,906
Rym: yeah There's fistfights, and I hops.

336
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:21,584
Rym: I don't know why I know why but Actually, I got another news.

337
00:20:21,604 --> 00:20:40,660
Rym: That's related to why there are fistfights that I hops mm-hmm, but so Applebee's rather than just Taking it like a noble warrior and dying of their wound in glory they have a plan to stay alive and It's kind of amazing because they basically decided that our friend scojo his dad.

338
00:20:41,423 --> 00:20:45,280
Rym: That is the exact kind of person that they can milk money from forever.

339
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,249
Scott: Yeah, that's the kind of person who will eat at Applebee's.

340
00:20:47,269 --> 00:20:52,975
Scott: the person who doesn't who doesn't taste food is very picky You know only wants to eat meat and potatoes and nothing.

341
00:20:53,036 --> 00:20:53,660
Rym: I have a quote.

342
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:59,976
Rym: This is literally the whitey white people the strategy of who Applebee's is going to go after.

343
00:21:00,136 --> 00:21:01,560
Scott: but isn't that that's already the strategy?

344
00:21:01,981 --> 00:21:03,447
Scott: That's the strategy of all these restaurant.

345
00:21:03,487 --> 00:21:05,274
Rym: Oh, no, but how it like how they're doing it.

346
00:21:05,535 --> 00:21:06,820
Rym: This is amazing in my perspective.

347
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,480
Rym: There's a quote for the article from Applebee's.

348
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:16,509
Rym: I think this pursuit the pursuit being trying to go after Millennials who have a more sophisticated dining mindset Led to decisions.

349
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:21,118
Rym: that quote created confusion among core guests.

350
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:27,740
Rym: Yeah, why do you write to your way from what I'll call its middle America roots?

351
00:21:28,281 --> 00:21:34,638
Rym: So basically they added a rugel into the menu and middle class American white people were like what the fuck is that?

352
00:21:34,658 --> 00:21:35,300
Rym: and they got confused.

353
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,892
Scott: Mm-hmm, so quote regular the best of all lettuces moving forward.

354
00:21:39,912 --> 00:21:40,935
Rym: Yeah, it's spicy.

355
00:21:40,955 --> 00:21:41,416
Rym: It's got like some.

356
00:21:41,497 --> 00:21:42,680
Rym: it's good stuff the best.

357
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,375
Rym: Oh, I don't make a pure real salad though.

358
00:21:45,395 --> 00:21:46,159
Rym: You sprinkle that it was.

359
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:58,831
Rym: no No, you got to buy a mix, but you know, it's still the best lettuce quote moving forward They said that Applebee's will focus on routine traditionalist who Actually enjoy casual dining chains.

360
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:00,900
Rym: Yeah and have favorite menu items.

361
00:22:01,121 --> 00:22:02,167
Scott: I mean, that's Applebee's will.

362
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:03,454
Rym: just they even know this.

363
00:22:03,675 --> 00:22:06,663
Rym: they say the words Actually, enjoy.

364
00:22:06,683 --> 00:22:11,560
Rym: I mean, they're like, let's find people who actually eat this shit and like market that exclusive.

365
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,580
Scott: They already been doing their whole existence.

366
00:22:13,648 --> 00:22:20,160
Rym: No They were trying to expand into people who have taste buds and they realize that that will scare away their non taste bud demographic.

367
00:22:21,002 --> 00:22:21,988
Scott: I mean you just make a new rest.

368
00:22:22,029 --> 00:22:25,489
Scott: if you want to get people who actually have taste buds You have to make a new restaurant with the new brands.

369
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:26,817
Scott: You don't know that it's Applebee's.

370
00:22:26,897 --> 00:22:32,073
Rym: take Applebee's Shit food, but call it like artisanal beef burger.

371
00:22:32,194 --> 00:22:38,829
Scott: I mean and for a grown Was not a separate business.

372
00:22:38,889 --> 00:22:40,377
Scott: imagine if so wouldn't eat their shake shacks.

373
00:22:40,417 --> 00:22:41,585
Scott: not that good I'm not saying.

374
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:42,149
Scott: I'm just saying.

375
00:22:42,169 --> 00:22:44,585
Scott: but people who have you know People eat there right.

376
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:47,100
Scott: people who refuse to eat at McDonald's go to Shake Shack, right?

377
00:22:47,581 --> 00:22:51,379
Scott: If you were McDonald's you could just use your McDonald's money and open up shake shacks.

378
00:22:51,762 --> 00:22:53,573
Scott: It's assuming like or you make up a new.

379
00:22:53,694 --> 00:22:54,680
Scott: make up a new thing, right?

380
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:02,543
Scott: Imagine if Chipotle wasn't actually its own thing if Chipotle had just been a thing that Taco Bell came up with and it was owned By Taco Bell.

381
00:23:02,563 --> 00:23:03,989
Rym: Ah, but there's a big difference.

382
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:12,480
Scott: instead of opening up Taco Bell's they started opening up You know fancier thing that sector that the so-called fast casual like Chipotle is basically in that category.

383
00:23:13,422 --> 00:23:22,684
Rym: They're doing better not because of branding or anything But because I guess young people with taste buds just want better food and that kind of food while it's not great is Actually prepared.

384
00:23:22,704 --> 00:23:24,270
Rym: Yeah, like.

385
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,274
Rym: it's not just a bag.

386
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:25,857
Rym: You can see it.

387
00:23:25,877 --> 00:23:28,526
Scott: You can see prepared Yeah, and it's prepared very simply.

388
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:30,853
Rym: but I feel like what's killing.

389
00:23:30,913 --> 00:23:35,892
Scott: if Applebee's wanted to get money from different people They could just use their money instead of opening up an Applebee's.

390
00:23:35,993 --> 00:23:40,690
Scott: open up make up a new brand Right and no, but there have arugula there.

391
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:44,060
Rym: their value prop is the super master's food.

392
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:56,120
Rym: And I think the real problem, I mean Olive Garden owns Capitol Grill and Capitol girls great and Olive Gardens garbage Yeah, but at the same time Capitol Grill Has a much different value proposition and demographic.

393
00:23:56,961 --> 00:23:58,228
Scott: Yeah, you need a different.

394
00:23:58,309 --> 00:24:00,260
Scott: we can't take the existing Applebee's brand.

395
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,284
Rym: No But your argument is just.

396
00:24:01,525 --> 00:24:02,871
Scott: it's too hard to try to please you.

397
00:24:02,891 --> 00:24:08,292
Rym: just make a video game studio just make games because there's more Margins that like you know, I'm saying look Applebee's Applebee's.

398
00:24:08,312 --> 00:24:10,460
Rym: just take all their money and put it in an index fund.

399
00:24:10,561 --> 00:24:18,020
Scott: You can't take your existing Applebee's brand Which is always made food for one kind of person and suddenly sort of shift it to aim at a different person.

400
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:23,198
Scott: All right, so now they I guess someone's stupid they're trying to do that and now they're just going back.

401
00:24:23,439 --> 00:24:24,590
Scott: yep It's not.

402
00:24:24,893 --> 00:24:25,560
Scott: what's the big deal?

403
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,310
Rym: I feel like it.

404
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:31,994
Rym: the the thrust is that Because of internet and people and like things like Yelp people act like like.

405
00:24:32,034 --> 00:24:34,744
Rym: even I like me and everyone I know if there's a New restaurant in town.

406
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:38,180
Rym: I go check out its reviews and like see what's up with it and see if it's real food.

407
00:24:38,281 --> 00:24:39,818
Rym: I don't go back to places that have bad food.

408
00:24:40,821 --> 00:24:42,485
Scott: Why would you go to a place of bad food?

409
00:24:42,566 --> 00:24:47,580
Rym: a routine traditionalist who actually enjoy eating a casual restaurants people who are dying.

410
00:24:48,181 --> 00:24:52,154
Rym: So another minor news that is interesting and kind of an end of an era.

411
00:24:52,395 --> 00:24:53,980
Rym: Chuck E. Cheese's isn't doing well either.

412
00:24:54,221 --> 00:24:55,205
Scott: No, why would it be so?

413
00:24:55,225 --> 00:24:55,868
Scott: if you're not familiar?

414
00:24:55,908 --> 00:24:58,780
Rym: Chuck E. Cheese's much like major magics in the u.s.

415
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:09,118
Rym: if that even still exists is a chain of places where Families can take their children to lose them and then get into fistfights with other families while eating terrible pizza.

416
00:25:09,138 --> 00:25:16,934
Rym: Mm-hmm that's basically the service they provide and The showcase of all these kinds of restaurant quote-unquote arcade restaurants.

417
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:20,487
Rym: the ball pit was the Animatronics on stage.

418
00:25:20,929 --> 00:25:22,819
Rym: That's what five nights at Freddy's was making fun of.

419
00:25:23,502 --> 00:25:29,140
Rym: Chuck E. Cheese's is trying to rebrand so they're getting rid of a lot of the old animatronics.

420
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,648
Rym: They're retiring them and what they're doing?

421
00:25:31,668 --> 00:25:32,691
Scott: don't give a shit about this.

422
00:25:33,112 --> 00:25:35,440
Rym: Oh, yeah, but what they're doing is even worse.

423
00:25:36,303 --> 00:25:49,780
Rym: Chuck E. Cheese's plans to modernize several restaurants by toning down its wacky colorful design Removing animatronics and Adding dance floors where humans dressed as the eponymous rodent will come out and dance with children.

424
00:25:50,129 --> 00:25:54,995
Rym: All right I don't really think that children ever wanted to go to a Chuck E.

425
00:25:55,035 --> 00:25:56,620
Scott: Cheese's to dance.

426
00:25:56,781 --> 00:25:57,666
Scott: No, that was a kid.

427
00:25:57,707 --> 00:25:59,860
Scott: is there to play games because there aren't arcades anymore.

428
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,469
Rym: So when I was a kid, I wanted to go to a Chuck E.

429
00:26:01,509 --> 00:26:03,400
Scott: Cheese's only have crane games now.

430
00:26:03,581 --> 00:26:06,694
Rym: Yeah, uh and fistfights even.

431
00:26:06,734 --> 00:26:08,060
Scott: we went to Dave and Busters, right?

432
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:12,520
Scott: So this I went to a Dave and Busters recently like within the month it had like one almost playable game.

433
00:26:12,561 --> 00:26:19,123
Scott: I Went to that Dave and Busters in the Palisades when it was brand new and when I was one of the only Dave and Busters That existed.

434
00:26:19,163 --> 00:26:21,471
Scott: and when I went to it in those days, right?

435
00:26:21,953 --> 00:26:23,860
Scott: It had fancy pool tables.

436
00:26:24,362 --> 00:26:26,693
Scott: It had you know, the shuffleboard table shuffleboard.

437
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:28,040
Rym: Oh, yeah, that's good stuff, right?

438
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,369
Scott: It had laser tag that was relatively high quality.

439
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:35,420
Scott: I mean, it wasn't Cuzar but it was relatively high quality laser tag.

440
00:26:35,501 --> 00:26:37,134
Scott: It was you know, it wasn't the greatest but he was.

441
00:26:37,235 --> 00:26:37,659
Scott: it was there.

442
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:53,803
Scott: And it had all these legit arcade games like, you know time crisis DDR and like all the street fighters back me all the legit arcade games that you expect now, right and when you were standing at any arcade game there's a little switch.

443
00:26:53,823 --> 00:27:01,058
Scott: you could flick and you flick the switch weight service would come to the arcade machine and ask you what you Wanted to drink or eat and then bring it to you.

444
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,420
Scott: So you could eat or drink and they even had a cup holders on the machines and everything.

445
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:10,180
Rym: I feel like within ten years something like that could be remade in some capacity.

446
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:19,854
Scott: so target people like in between that time which was in I guess the late 90s and now the 2017 that Dave and Busters is still there the same exact location.

447
00:27:20,436 --> 00:27:21,520
Scott: There's no laser tag there.

448
00:27:21,902 --> 00:27:24,376
Scott: They still had the shuffleboard tables and the pool tables.

449
00:27:24,396 --> 00:27:30,636
Scott: Yeah however The there were basically no real arcade games to speak of.

450
00:27:30,676 --> 00:27:33,432
Scott: the only real arcade games They had were a pump.

451
00:27:33,956 --> 00:27:34,359
Scott: pump it up.

452
00:27:34,379 --> 00:27:35,343
Scott: no Yeah, what.

453
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:36,106
Scott: and just one of them.

454
00:27:36,227 --> 00:27:39,600
Scott: and if you looked at the pricing to play this pump, right?

455
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:48,820
Scott: Pretty much every game was ridiculously overpriced because you had to basically get a card Put money on the card and I did math on my phone to figure out like how much these games actually cost to play.

456
00:27:49,682 --> 00:27:50,749
Scott: They had one air hockey.

457
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:52,480
Scott: That was a good air hockey, right?

458
00:27:53,001 --> 00:27:57,000
Scott: It was basically like two dollars to play this air hockey two dollars plus man.

459
00:27:57,102 --> 00:27:57,979
Rym: I remember when I was a kid.

460
00:27:58,541 --> 00:27:59,524
Rym: Arcade games were a quarter.

461
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:03,736
Rym: a new arcade game was 75 like Mortal Kombat was 75 cents.

462
00:28:03,756 --> 00:28:05,808
Scott: when it first came to play There was one Ms.

463
00:28:06,252 --> 00:28:08,787
Scott: Pac-man Galaga And a game that moved cost a dollar.

464
00:28:08,867 --> 00:28:11,156
Scott: it cost over a dollar to play one round of Ms.

465
00:28:11,196 --> 00:28:12,320
Scott: Pac-man slash Galaga.

466
00:28:13,061 --> 00:28:14,649
Scott: Right, they didn't have it.

467
00:28:14,871 --> 00:28:16,358
Scott: There was not a single fighting game there.

468
00:28:17,301 --> 00:28:19,266
Scott: There was the Mario Kart arcade game.

469
00:28:19,747 --> 00:28:26,164
Rym: cost like multiple dollars to play once also to be honest when I finally played that Mario Kart Arcade game.

470
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:26,889
Rym: it's not good.

471
00:28:27,211 --> 00:28:29,384
Scott: It's actually if you look at it It kind of is good.

472
00:28:29,464 --> 00:28:31,532
Scott: the problem is in order to like it's made.

473
00:28:31,612 --> 00:28:33,800
Scott: it's actually a Japanese arcade machine, which is weird.

474
00:28:33,941 --> 00:28:36,480
Rym: Oh, it could be almost good if you played it with people.

475
00:28:36,542 --> 00:28:44,859
Scott: Yeah It's meant for you to play it like Constantly like go to the game center after school every day and keep playing like the initial D game that I would do.

476
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:48,160
Scott: that It's actually a real Japanese arcade machine.

477
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,360
Scott: Not the kind of thing you could you want in a Dave and Buster's that cost like multiple dollars to play even just one race.

478
00:28:54,063 --> 00:28:59,379
Scott: Every single other machine in the place was basically gambling for children.

479
00:28:59,902 --> 00:29:01,689
Scott: but actually I think it's weird.

480
00:29:01,729 --> 00:29:11,340
Scott: right how it's like if we have gambling in a casino and Where you put down a dollar on the craps table and you could win real money or lose your dollar most likely.

481
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,628
Scott: Right, that is perfectly.

482
00:29:13,648 --> 00:29:13,728
Scott: Okay.

483
00:29:14,029 --> 00:29:17,320
Rym: Oh, I do not know legally exactly why those are different.

484
00:29:17,661 --> 00:29:21,275
Scott: It's only for adults that this is allowed right and children cannot do this.

485
00:29:21,696 --> 00:29:26,371
Rym: only people who are Looking Wildwood little kids can like get yes and win a TV right.

486
00:29:26,451 --> 00:29:32,219
Scott: yet you go and here in the Dave and Buster's They have what's basically a gambling machine, right?

487
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:40,575
Scott: Ski-ball is gambling or you know, there's some skill involved but not really right and you put your money in and you gamble and like.

488
00:29:41,037 --> 00:29:42,765
Scott: there's like a Real good examples.

489
00:29:42,806 --> 00:29:44,980
Scott: They had like a dealer no-deal machine, right?

490
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:50,920
Scott: And it's like you put in real money and the only thing that can come out is tickets, right?

491
00:29:51,282 --> 00:29:53,130
Scott: Even if you lose no tickets come out.

492
00:29:53,170 --> 00:30:01,267
Scott: if you win tickets come out, but your money is gone No matter what it's gambling with a hundred percent chance of losing Right, at least at the casino.

493
00:30:01,307 --> 00:30:05,640
Scott: You have a non zero percent chance of losing even though it's you know, really high.

494
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:21,060
Rym: So I remember coming to a terrible realization It's a hundred percent chance of losing your money and all you're gonna get is maybe some worthless plastic garbage Tickets Would go to the arcade and like I get tickets in the course of playing even some real games.

495
00:30:21,161 --> 00:30:21,998
Rym: I really care about them.

496
00:30:22,461 --> 00:30:31,790
Rym: But then I realize plastic frog and some candy on my way realized one day there is one like bullshitty crane type game And I figured out how to always get the maximum payout.

497
00:30:31,991 --> 00:30:32,694
Scott: cranes go.

498
00:30:32,854 --> 00:30:37,271
Scott: actual cranes though are gambling We know because they're all rigged, but this wasn't actually a crane.

499
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:39,220
Rym: It was like a roll of quarter and lands on a strip.

500
00:30:39,401 --> 00:30:39,924
Scott: We were good at.

501
00:30:39,964 --> 00:30:45,048
Scott: that's the one we used also because I was the only game Where you could that had the highest ticket.

502
00:30:45,108 --> 00:30:46,735
Rym: to coin radio me and a bunch of kids.

503
00:30:46,755 --> 00:30:48,080
Rym: we figured out the exact angle.

504
00:30:49,446 --> 00:30:53,609
Scott: We got a hot glue gun and we glue Oh use the glue tape to tape it in the exact right.

505
00:30:53,649 --> 00:30:58,266
Scott: we filled the two sides with hot glue because you could get 200 tickets for one token.

506
00:30:58,286 --> 00:30:58,787
Scott: we get that guy.

507
00:30:58,807 --> 00:31:00,192
Rym: remember we unplugged.

508
00:31:00,212 --> 00:31:05,249
Rym: remember those like hologram games Like the cowboy game or the time crappy Sega ones.

509
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:05,651
Rym: Yeah.

510
00:31:05,751 --> 00:31:08,300
Rym: Yeah, we unplugged that machine to plug the glue gun in.

511
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,203
Rym: Glue gun did.

512
00:31:10,223 --> 00:31:15,170
Rym: and then we and then the kids start like putting quarters in and like getting the max pay out a machine run Out of tickets.

513
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:19,520
Rym: Oh, yeah It ran out of tickets and the guy had to come over and put more tickets in and then you emptied it again.

514
00:31:19,721 --> 00:31:23,989
Rym: We had emptied it like three or four times and then the guy was like, yeah This machine's coming out of service.

515
00:31:24,069 --> 00:31:25,540
Rym: and then the next day the machine was gone forever.

516
00:31:27,101 --> 00:31:29,828
Rym: But while the kids were doing this, I didn't put any money in the machine.

517
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:37,298
Rym: I calculated that you were basically getting like Four cents per quarter worth of actual money.

518
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:43,014
Scott: So even with you it's like 200 tickets, you know gets you this prize.

519
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:45,000
Scott: What's the most valuable prize here?

520
00:31:45,702 --> 00:31:47,068
Scott: There's always the TV.

521
00:31:47,089 --> 00:31:48,516
Scott: the TV is this many tickets.

522
00:31:48,556 --> 00:31:53,308
Scott: to get that TV You'd have to put this many tokens in that machine Even if you got the jackpot every time.

523
00:31:53,428 --> 00:31:56,180
Scott: so I'm glad I was just buying that TV for this much money.

524
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,666
Scott: You could buy a TV for less than that.

525
00:31:57,787 --> 00:31:58,651
Rym: Oh, yeah, they had a game.

526
00:31:58,671 --> 00:32:00,579
Rym: I remember they had a Sega Game Gear.

527
00:32:02,083 --> 00:32:06,240
Rym: We had a game gear but my dream in life was to get a Saturday to game gear.

528
00:32:06,401 --> 00:32:08,710
Rym: It had a link cable thing that I was never able to use.

529
00:32:08,831 --> 00:32:12,585
Scott: only one game used maybe uh What used it there was?

530
00:32:12,605 --> 00:32:20,078
Scott: uh, so that Advance Wars like game crystal warriors for the original game boy game boy The only games I ever remember using the link cable for on October.

531
00:32:20,118 --> 00:32:21,707
Rym: Holy shit Was that a good game with the link cable?

532
00:32:21,767 --> 00:32:22,189
Scott: is that the?

533
00:32:22,611 --> 00:32:24,300
Scott: there was an f1 racing game?

534
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:30,660
Scott: Yeah, it was pretty good and Pokemon F1 racing game was like the game that they launched with the four-way game boy.

535
00:32:31,365 --> 00:32:33,240
Scott: Like that was the game that was meant to go with it.

536
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:36,272
Scott: That was like the Crystal Chronicles of that thing that game boy.

537
00:32:36,312 --> 00:32:37,056
Scott: only three games.

538
00:32:37,116 --> 00:32:38,060
Scott: I remember ever using it.

539
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,123
Scott: Maybe there was another one.

540
00:32:39,144 --> 00:32:45,823
Rym: I don't remember that game gear would have cost and the best-case scenario like $600 to win.

541
00:32:46,625 --> 00:32:55,427
Rym: so yeah, but anyway things Of the day.

542
00:32:55,447 --> 00:32:55,990
Rym: What do you got?

543
00:32:56,593 --> 00:33:04,560
Scott: So, uh You know, we always enjoy a good ol good ol fight or a good ol sporting event when someone gets some comeuppance.

544
00:33:05,264 --> 00:33:10,229
Scott: alright, so I found this video I came across today is Various sporting events.

545
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:15,069
Scott: most of them fights cuz you know But some of them also football and other basketball and whatnot.

546
00:33:15,129 --> 00:33:16,834
Rym: where the first one is so good.

547
00:33:17,115 --> 00:33:20,879
Scott: No, the soccer one is the best one Where you have one athlete?

548
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,591
Scott: Taunting the other athletes and what what?

549
00:33:24,912 --> 00:33:25,855
Scott: oh, I'm so great.

550
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:34,609
Scott: Oh, right, dude You know, you know the game is on but they're spending time in the game to say show me your moves Or I'm better than you.

551
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:36,400
Scott: Look I can do some bullshit.

552
00:33:38,565 --> 00:33:39,299
Scott: There's a lot of good.

553
00:33:41,961 --> 00:33:43,968
Scott: But anyway, oh that I saw that.

554
00:33:44,149 --> 00:33:45,795
Scott: oh, yeah, that's piece of shit.

555
00:33:46,016 --> 00:33:51,290
Scott: DJ X anyway, uh So here are many is a compilation here.

556
00:33:51,531 --> 00:33:58,208
Scott: Not just one one of these would be enough to be thing of the day but there's a whole compilation right of Instances you may have seen.

557
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:07,843
Scott: I saw I seen some of these before Yeah where one player taunts another player and that or perhaps someone in the crowd taught somebody and then Come up ins.

558
00:34:08,625 --> 00:34:09,507
Rym: This is a good thing.

559
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,752
Scott: So it's very satisfying.

560
00:34:10,792 --> 00:34:16,574
Scott: you get how many minutes have come up and see almost four Whoa, and for a YouTube compilation, that's a long one.

561
00:34:16,594 --> 00:34:17,620
Scott: The soccer one's the best one.

562
00:34:18,161 --> 00:34:28,431
Rym: So I found this essay a while ago and I kept forgetting about it, but it's really really fascinating and it is titled Alternative endings in Danish and Russian silent film.

563
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:31,679
Scott: was this like a silent movie that had different endings?

564
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:34,913
Rym: Oh, no, no, no, no, I'm gonna read or different times.

565
00:34:34,953 --> 00:34:35,576
Scott: They screened it.

566
00:34:35,596 --> 00:34:36,600
Scott: They showed different endings.

567
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:41,300
Rym: So I'm gonna read the entire first paragraph of the introduction because that's the only way that it describes it.

568
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:45,092
Rym: Well, this is really this paper is so fascinating.

569
00:34:45,213 --> 00:34:46,076
Rym: I'm just very.

570
00:34:46,136 --> 00:34:46,879
Rym: I'm just gonna read this.

571
00:34:47,581 --> 00:35:00,630
Rym: Toward the beginning of the last century film companies began producing and exporting Alternative endings for different national markets drawing on stereotypes to create a film narrative that would satisfy the Edge is the first thing or an audience.

572
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:03,060
Scott: It's the first thing I said where the different countries got different.

573
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,063
Scott: Yeah, so like who?

574
00:35:04,123 --> 00:35:06,310
Rym: the Russian people are sad, let's have sad endings.

575
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:06,631
Scott: Mm-hmm.

576
00:35:07,333 --> 00:35:22,191
Rym: at the center of this study are two countries Denmark and Russia who were to exchange specially adapted endings in the 1910s until the Russian Revolution of 1917 was severely restricted to Restrict trade and everything I messed up.

577
00:35:22,835 --> 00:35:29,080
Rym: in both cases The endings consist of a final scene in which the fate of the characters is altered.

578
00:35:29,561 --> 00:35:38,900
Rym: This meant that Danish actors would often come to a tragic or fatal end on the Russian screen When they had a happy resolution in other markets such as the UK US Denmark Sweden.

579
00:35:39,381 --> 00:35:49,759
Rym: Meanwhile Russian film companies would retain the inevitable end for the domestic audience But produce alternative happy endings for Western spectators of the same film.

580
00:35:50,781 --> 00:35:52,245
Scott: Would the Russians?

581
00:35:52,746 --> 00:35:58,040
Rym: Russian movies ended in fatal tragedy, but they'd have a happy ending for like the US or Denmark.

582
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:02,260
Scott: So there's this stereotype, I guess that must have existed saying that Russian people wanted to see.

583
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,378
Rym: People made this for themselves, too.

584
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:08,451
Rym: It wasn't just like dumb Americans don't understand the world and make different endings.

585
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:11,279
Rym: Russia made different endings for itself as well.

586
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:17,897
Scott: the thing is Was there perhaps a chicken egg cause and effect situation?

587
00:36:17,917 --> 00:36:23,328
Scott: We're actually showing Russian said so you want to know the deal.

588
00:36:23,609 --> 00:36:24,251
Rym: read this essay.

589
00:36:24,291 --> 00:36:28,969
Rym: This is a fully researched paper that explains Literally every aspect of this.

590
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:31,640
Rym: it is really really really fascinating.

591
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:40,220
Scott: So the Russians and other people made the Russians more sad by showing them tragedies Read your essay and made everyone else stupid by showing them happy and I haven't even finished it yet.

592
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,820
Rym: I only read like the first 10 or 11 pages.

593
00:36:41,941 --> 00:36:43,287
Rym: But this is super gets.

594
00:36:43,388 --> 00:36:48,438
Scott: if some of these movies are still available in some form Do they conclude both endings on the the DVD or?

595
00:36:49,802 --> 00:36:52,400
Scott: Yeah, though there's a clue like clue the movie.

596
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:58,480
Rym: I think there's a couple of old Buster Keaton movies that I'm gonna watch soon because I learned about them and they're interesting.

597
00:36:58,601 --> 00:36:59,285
Rym: But I digress.

598
00:36:59,325 --> 00:37:00,552
Scott: I've seen quite a few of them.

599
00:37:00,572 --> 00:37:01,457
Scott: I don't know if I've seen them all.

600
00:37:01,598 --> 00:37:07,552
Rym: Yeah So anyway in the meta moment, uh Our forum the GeekNights community.

601
00:37:07,753 --> 00:37:08,920
Rym: we upgraded it a while ago.

602
00:37:09,081 --> 00:37:13,220
Rym: So if you were an old-time listener GeekNights, you stop going to our awesome forum.

603
00:37:13,582 --> 00:37:16,520
Rym: That entire thing is archived in stasis in perpetuity.

604
00:37:17,261 --> 00:37:22,978
Scott: Hundreds of thousands of all of the public components of the old forum right are visible on the internet.

605
00:37:23,018 --> 00:37:27,033
Scott: not perfectly But all the content is there for you to go and look at.

606
00:37:27,073 --> 00:37:30,199
Scott: we're gonna keep it there frozen in time Like cats in America, right?

607
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:37,000
Scott: But our new form if you have a login for the old form You can still log in if you want to see like your direct messages to other people and stuff like that.

608
00:37:37,081 --> 00:37:38,438
Scott: I guess they're still in there somewhere.

609
00:37:39,222 --> 00:37:41,772
Scott: But you cannot make any new content on the old forum.

610
00:37:42,375 --> 00:37:42,676
Scott: You're right.

611
00:37:42,716 --> 00:37:43,640
Scott: We did this a while ago.

612
00:37:44,021 --> 00:37:46,412
Scott: The new forum is new and it's rockin.

613
00:37:46,653 --> 00:37:48,200
Scott: we finally got people to go to it.

614
00:37:48,541 --> 00:37:52,580
Scott: So because we mentioned it so we're gonna keep mentioning it to hopefully keep more people going to it.

615
00:37:52,982 --> 00:38:08,117
Rym: So if you if you're listening to these words That probably means that you'd have a lot in common with other people who listen to these words and our forum is kind of known at least for the people who've gone to it for being now if not an ivory tower then at least

616
00:38:08,418 --> 00:38:08,438
Scott: a

617
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,549
Rym: Slightly less poop filled tower.

618
00:38:11,569 --> 00:38:13,900
Rym: that's slightly above the poop line of the Internet.

619
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:19,644
Scott: So you want to go to our website for a crew calm and at the top of the website is a link like community Or forum or whatever.

620
00:38:19,684 --> 00:38:21,652
Scott: it click on that shit and then sign up.

621
00:38:21,712 --> 00:38:23,700
Scott: the thing you need to know is that when you sign up?

622
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:29,960
Scott: There's gonna be a box and that box is gonna say why are you joining and a lot of people fill in that box?

623
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:37,598
Scott: someone filled in that box today and They wrote something that was so obvious that that was the person who knew who they were.

624
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:41,251
Scott: So I said But somebody else filled it out and they were just like.

625
00:38:41,331 --> 00:38:48,500
Scott: I want to have discussions with like-minded people And now that seems like a sentence that is clearly answering the question as do I fellow children?

626
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:53,338
Scott: And it is an answer in that box that you're pretty sure like a bot wouldn't write that right.

627
00:38:53,539 --> 00:39:07,946
Scott: However If that sentence didn't tell me anything to prove that this was a person who listens to GeekNights and knows who we are Right, you need to write something in that box so that I know that you if you any guy deleted your application And you didn't get into the forum.

628
00:39:08,409 --> 00:39:10,500
Scott: try again and write something in that box.

629
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,489
Scott: That's better this time, right?

630
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:19,795
Scott: something that lets me know that you are Someone who was actually in our community and not just a random internet person or bot.

631
00:39:20,217 --> 00:39:30,420
Scott: now if you're not sure You could even write for example, if you wrote something like Rym is a doodoo head It's like oh, this is a person who knows what GeekNights is All right, the box not gonna figure out to put the word Rym in there, right?

632
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,460
Scott: If someone wrote something like, you know, I want to insult Scott a whole bunch.

633
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,855
Scott: It's like oh, I know this is a person who knows what the deal is.

634
00:39:36,895 --> 00:39:37,680
Scott: I'll approve that right?

635
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,364
Scott: So what I'm gonna link to?

636
00:39:38,384 --> 00:39:41,945
Scott: but if you say I want to talk about video games, it's like well I don't know.

637
00:39:42,006 --> 00:39:42,530
Scott: you could just be.

638
00:39:42,571 --> 00:39:43,539
Scott: so who knows who you are?

639
00:39:43,822 --> 00:39:50,360
Rym: If you're not sure if you want to deal with this forum What I'm actually gonna link to is the rules of our forum and you can just go to this site one.

640
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:51,320
Rym: We updated them recently.

641
00:39:51,441 --> 00:39:54,639
Rym: So I kind of want people who haven't read them in a long time to read them but to.

642
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:05,043
Rym: These rules will tell you exactly what kind of community we have and as much as I love both packs and penny arcade their forums are Something.

643
00:40:05,785 --> 00:40:07,730
Scott: well, I mean there's definitely worse forums than.

644
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:10,979
Rym: oh, yeah, there are worse forums, but I wouldn't go to those forums either.

645
00:40:11,901 --> 00:40:15,234
Rym: Our forum is a place that I would hang out at and I do hang out at.

646
00:40:15,555 --> 00:40:20,240
Scott: and the other thing about our forum Is that all the content in it is actually public on the internet?

647
00:40:20,721 --> 00:40:23,655
Scott: So unless private messages and shit, which I guess they're in there somewhere.

648
00:40:23,696 --> 00:40:24,218
Scott: I don't use those.

649
00:40:25,501 --> 00:40:31,760
Scott: But so if you don't want to make an account you can just read and lurk Without having to do any account making or anything all you want.

650
00:40:32,001 --> 00:40:36,900
Rym: But if you make the account, it'll keep track of like how far you're read into the like 400 post fruit thread.

651
00:40:37,061 --> 00:40:41,420
Scott: Yeah, it's useful to make an account even if you don't post anything because then it's easier to like.

652
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,020
Scott: You know mark things as read and see when there's new posts and that sort of thing.

653
00:40:45,121 --> 00:40:47,296
Scott: So and like you can like things even if you don't post.

654
00:40:47,598 --> 00:40:57,037
Rym: Yep Also very soon We're gonna be at PAX West Emily and I'll be in Seattle for like eight days and Scott will join us Shortly after we get there and you're like there two or three days after.

655
00:40:57,057 --> 00:41:01,390
Scott: yeah PAX West the mothership the real pack will be there.

656
00:41:01,651 --> 00:41:02,293
Rym: We'll be home.

657
00:41:02,473 --> 00:41:06,986
Rym: It's real soon and we're only doing one panel on Sunday September 3rd 6 30 p.m.

658
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,029
Rym: In the Hippogriff theater.

659
00:41:08,169 --> 00:41:14,616
Scott: Our panel is competing with like all these big-time events like, you know So, I don't know how many people are gonna come to it.

660
00:41:14,817 --> 00:41:15,280
Rym: Yeah, we'll see.

661
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:21,378
Rym: I mean one year we did like literally the last panel and no one no one came a peck south.

662
00:41:21,438 --> 00:41:22,080
Rym: a ton people came.

663
00:41:22,301 --> 00:41:23,631
Scott: Yeah, but no but it PAX West.

664
00:41:23,732 --> 00:41:28,600
Scott: our attendance has been Dwindling yeah, but East and South we're still getting good attendance.

665
00:41:28,781 --> 00:41:32,500
Rym: Oh, man West as far as I can see panel attendance across the board has dwindled.

666
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:36,079
Scott: There's so much more panels and they're spread out among different buildings.

667
00:41:36,521 --> 00:41:41,980
Rym: So the secret is the first letter of the name of a panel room at where it is every year.

668
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:46,820
Scott: I'm like afraid that like we're actually gonna get denied for panels at West because it's getting so bigger.

669
00:41:47,041 --> 00:41:50,900
Rym: It's big time because there was a time when we would do like three or four panels at a pack.

670
00:41:51,123 --> 00:41:55,580
Scott: It's getting bigger time or you know It's a bigger deal at PAX West than it is the other paxes, but you know what?

671
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:56,700
Scott: I saw a panel on the schedule.

672
00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:01,160
Scott: I went through guidebook and added all the stuff I might want to see and there was some real good stuff in there.

673
00:42:01,467 --> 00:42:04,490
Rym: Oh, yeah Well that chicken panel I went to with the last packs.

674
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:09,131
Scott: There was a panel about like Like the data science of.

675
00:42:09,291 --> 00:42:10,317
Scott: I'm going to that one if I can anyway.

676
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:20,040
Scott: but there was one that was like let's rate the top ten NES games of all time and it's like Like alright if that's on the schedule, then I'm not worried about us getting on the schedule.

677
00:42:20,281 --> 00:42:21,690
Rym: So I double-checked.

678
00:42:22,012 --> 00:42:25,938
Rym: this will be our 42nd panel at a pax

679
00:42:26,803 --> 00:42:27,024
Scott: Mmm,

680
00:42:27,144 --> 00:42:28,571
Rym: that's a lot of panels

681
00:42:29,053 --> 00:42:31,945
Scott: and that's only the ones at paxes Yeah, and other conventions

682
00:42:32,106 --> 00:42:43,590
Rym: if you add up other conventions were over 400 so over Yeah, a lot of panels over the years, but because the name of the panel groom is hippogriff It starts with H. It's in the Hyatt.

683
00:42:43,851 --> 00:42:44,031
Scott: Mm-hmm.

684
00:42:44,433 --> 00:42:46,260
Rym: So go over to the Hyatt to see our panel.

685
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,489
Rym: That's where we saw Tetris guys.

686
00:42:47,509 --> 00:42:47,791
Rym: somebody.

687
00:42:47,851 --> 00:42:50,366
Scott: it's not in the Tetris guy room It's in the room further back than that.

688
00:42:50,426 --> 00:42:51,531
Scott: Yes, the smaller one.

689
00:42:51,692 --> 00:42:52,174
Scott: Obviously.

690
00:42:52,295 --> 00:42:52,978
Rym: I didn't look at the map.

691
00:42:53,038 --> 00:42:53,440
Rym: Is it smaller?

692
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,334
Rym: I thought they were the same size, but it's more squarish.

693
00:42:56,454 --> 00:42:57,580
Scott: Is the other ones wider?

694
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,505
Rym: I can never tell.

695
00:42:58,525 --> 00:42:58,666
Rym: I don't

696
00:42:58,686 --> 00:42:59,451
Scott: know what the capacity

697
00:42:59,512 --> 00:43:00,358
Rym: I mean in the old

698
00:43:00,398 --> 00:43:00,982
Scott: days You

699
00:43:01,485 --> 00:43:15,467
Rym: know, you can tell that panels have changed at paxes like they don't really fill that often unless there's swag or big celebrities because in the old days like our game mechanics and mechanism design panel filled this giant fucking room and There's so many more panels now.

700
00:43:15,548 --> 00:43:18,100
Rym: packs actually did a good job of like spreading the crowd out.

701
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:19,892
Rym: You can usually see a panel you want to see.

702
00:43:20,375 --> 00:43:23,099
Rym: unlike the old days You have to line up like three hours to see anything.

703
00:43:23,401 --> 00:43:26,480
Scott: Anyway, so the last thing we got time as the book club books.

704
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,849
Rym: Oh, you have an updated the site yet a book club still doing.

705
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:31,856
Scott: I actually thought about doing it and then I got busy and Didn't do it.

706
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:42,579
Scott: So the book club selection for the next book club episode which will probably happen after pack sometime in September or something is the fifth season by NK Jemisin.

707
00:43:43,761 --> 00:43:46,029
Scott: Summer not March not fall.

708
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:46,953
Rym: stupid smart, right.

709
00:43:47,435 --> 00:43:48,880
Scott: this book, right?

710
00:43:49,080 --> 00:44:10,272
Scott: I have learned won the hugo award two years ago and The next book in the same series as this book by the same author when the hugo award This year and the third and I think final book in this three book series Just came out and this is like nobody I don't think anyone's ever won the hugo award twice in a row.

711
00:44:10,532 --> 00:44:12,660
Scott: old friend same book in the same series.

712
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:17,756
Rym: old friends and people have been coming out of the woodwork in the Ignite community because we mentioned this book.

713
00:44:17,797 --> 00:44:20,066
Rym: is the book club to Talk about in the forum.

714
00:44:20,247 --> 00:44:25,851
Scott: I chose this book is the book club because it's such a big frickin deal And this book was just optioned.

715
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:28,140
Scott: They're gonna make a TV series on TNT.

716
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:30,346
Scott: Yeah, so this is like this.

717
00:44:30,526 --> 00:44:36,905
Scott: This is like the hottest of the hotness of sci-fi fantasy type, you know literature Novels right now.

718
00:44:36,925 --> 00:44:41,966
Rym: I feel like this is gonna tide us over cuz now that the Last Prince I mean, I don't.

719
00:44:42,066 --> 00:44:47,366
Scott: I've only read like half a chapter and and then I stopped to redo it and I'm gonna go back to It.

720
00:44:47,406 --> 00:44:54,783
Rym: price just start over because I forget I gotta finish the the the false son after the because I finished the appendix in the friends of nothing But I didn't finish.

721
00:44:54,963 --> 00:44:56,949
Scott: I read the whole finish all the appendix.

722
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:58,775
Rym: I read every entry in the appendix.

723
00:44:58,795 --> 00:45:07,420
Scott: But anyway, uh the point is I Can I cannot imagine this being not a miraculous incredible amazing book?

724
00:45:07,841 --> 00:45:18,879
Scott: No, probably gonna end up just going one two three with all three of these books and also if they're all as great as I Presume they are I'll probably just read every work of nk.

725
00:45:19,701 --> 00:45:22,471
Rym: That's probably good because the no god is gonna be.

726
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:26,359
Scott: it's gonna be a while before that but it's gonna be a while before I Need to read any other books.

727
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:31,257
Scott: So this yeah those books alone will be able to carry me over probably all through the winter and maybe into next year.

728
00:45:31,277 --> 00:45:36,293
Rym: Yep Though I didn't remember that Scott backer actually read his two non fantasy books.

729
00:45:36,614 --> 00:45:36,895
Scott: I didn't.

735
00:45:47,645 --> 00:45:51,520
Rym: the only gimmick is he has perfect memory and no one else on earth does no magic.

736
00:45:51,621 --> 00:45:53,350
Rym: Just he has literally perfect memory.

737
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:55,300
Rym: That's it, but I don't know no one else.

738
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:57,219
Scott: I don't even remember what's on the previous page in the book.

739
00:45:59,402 --> 00:46:07,770
Rym: And the other one neuropath is basically all the same shit that happens in The Prince of Nothing like that kind of stuff But in a world where there is no magic and there aren't gods.

740
00:46:07,851 --> 00:46:09,739
Rym: So the answer is just well, you're fucked.

741
00:46:09,819 --> 00:46:10,100
Rym: No free.

742
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:10,883
Scott: Well, mm-hmm.

743
00:46:11,526 --> 00:46:12,771
Scott: So I have cars.

744
00:46:13,414 --> 00:46:13,836
Scott: Oh, and I was.

745
00:46:13,856 --> 00:46:15,376
Scott: this is your idea I didn't have.

746
00:46:15,396 --> 00:46:21,360
Scott: well Are you sure we haven't done an episode about show such a fundamental aspect of life in modern society?

747
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:30,220
Rym: We did a show a long goddamn time ago where we still when we used to do our how to not suck at series Called how to not suck at driving and I listened to a little bit of it.

748
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:34,200
Rym: We seem to just talk about the technique of driving and how to not be a shitty driver.

749
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:34,740
Scott: All right.

750
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:41,120
Scott: So the thing with cars that before cars it sucked to get anywhere like to go somewhere was an Oregon Trail situation.

751
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:41,983
Rym: Well, does that for you?

752
00:46:42,003 --> 00:46:47,549
Rym: or if you were rich and you lived in like London you just sit in a tiny box and people Carry it on sticks.

753
00:46:47,791 --> 00:46:54,931
Scott: Yeah, or Eventually, we invented trains but even those or and boats But even those would take a long ass time to get anywhere.

754
00:46:55,232 --> 00:46:57,260
Scott: the car was such a tremendous invention.

755
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:03,120
Scott: You could finally fucking go someplace alone without a whole bunch of people in a schedule on a train or a boat.

756
00:47:03,522 --> 00:47:04,507
Scott: Just on your own.

757
00:47:04,527 --> 00:47:07,040
Scott: you can go really far really fast.

758
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,286
Scott: You could actually get to like the.

759
00:47:08,728 --> 00:47:14,790
Scott: you know, fucking California for New York Right and like a reasonable amount of time like a few days.

760
00:47:14,810 --> 00:47:29,148
Rym: Now, of course the problem an entire year-long journey in America Gas prices being cheap coupled with mass-produced cars meant we could just start building houses in places that were previously non-viable And people were just commute into the city.

761
00:47:29,208 --> 00:47:39,237
Scott: and even after we invented planes which let us go really far really fast like California in a few hours Cars were still much better for going shorter distances really fast.

762
00:47:39,438 --> 00:47:47,792
Scott: So I Loved driving driving as an activity either For transportation or racing or recreation.

763
00:47:48,194 --> 00:47:49,840
Scott: I still think driving is mad fun.

764
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:57,484
Rym: I love playing racing games and driving cars is fun, but ever since I moved to commute in New York I hate cars.

765
00:47:57,505 --> 00:48:02,117
Rym: I think I would either love a future where driving a car is illegal.

766
00:48:02,558 --> 00:48:10,047
Scott: Not only While I still enjoy the heck out of driving as an activity to do right even if I'm not even going anywhere Just driving a car.

767
00:48:10,127 --> 00:48:11,417
Scott: operating a vehicle is fun.

768
00:48:11,437 --> 00:48:23,066
Scott: Yeah As much as I enjoy that I get this twinge you're like, oh right the hassle and cost of having a car even if I live in a place where I need the car is Worse is not worth.

769
00:48:23,126 --> 00:48:25,697
Scott: that hassle to the enjoyment doesn't make up for it.

770
00:48:25,797 --> 00:48:31,100
Scott: And also Today we have different technologies available for transportation.

771
00:48:31,682 --> 00:48:35,052
Scott: Right besides car better car different car, right?

772
00:48:35,092 --> 00:48:35,413
Scott: We host.

773
00:48:35,433 --> 00:48:37,480
Rym: those options don't exist unless you live in New York.

774
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:38,927
Scott: I'm just saying there are.

775
00:48:39,108 --> 00:48:43,308
Scott: there are other options that exist if we would You know in state car called the bus.

776
00:48:43,549 --> 00:48:46,320
Rym: Yeah, what a car that only goes on one lane called a train.

777
00:48:46,622 --> 00:48:52,247
Scott: There are things we have if we would say that are better than car Even though they just haven't been set up.

778
00:48:52,287 --> 00:48:55,220
Scott: So car is like is a forced choice in most places.

779
00:48:56,181 --> 00:49:00,832
Scott: but Cars now like back then they helped the world.

780
00:49:00,872 --> 00:49:05,760
Scott: they helped, you know for all the damage They did in terms of murdering people and pollution and whatnot.

781
00:49:06,141 --> 00:49:10,360
Scott: They advanced society by just you know, finally making transportation possible.

782
00:49:10,922 --> 00:49:19,189
Scott: But now we're at a point at which the harm they are doing in their current form is Greater than the benefit they are giving.

783
00:49:19,209 --> 00:49:22,080
Scott: Yeah, so we really need to do something about car.

784
00:49:22,681 --> 00:49:25,911
Rym: So at least for my personal experience though, it's interest.

785
00:49:25,951 --> 00:49:28,740
Rym: I think uber as much as uber is horrible.

786
00:49:29,244 --> 00:49:39,532
Rym: I'm not talking about their business model or anything But that sort of like really changed a lot of people's relationship with cars I think because the conventional wisdom has been forever.

787
00:49:40,213 --> 00:49:43,464
Rym: if you live in America, you must own a car Full stop.

788
00:49:43,765 --> 00:49:48,180
Scott: The only exception was I mean I bought one as soon as I could, you know could buy one.

789
00:49:48,241 --> 00:49:49,474
Scott: It's like as I had to have one.

790
00:49:49,494 --> 00:49:58,485
Scott: the only Necessity was if you live like food water car house if you both lived and worked in New York City Maybe Yonkers.

791
00:49:58,606 --> 00:49:59,511
Scott: Yeah when I moved here.

792
00:49:59,531 --> 00:50:11,500
Scott: I was like, yeah I'm not gonna need the car but ended up driving it here and bringing it here and then after like You know like six months or something I was like, wow, I've had this car here and I keep moving it back and forth across the street.

793
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:15,316
Scott: Yeah, and I'm not using this car ever.

794
00:50:15,416 --> 00:50:16,260
Scott: I used it once.

795
00:50:16,381 --> 00:50:18,880
Rym: I remember I drove to comp con when I was on the Otakon staff.

796
00:50:18,961 --> 00:50:20,280
Rym: I borrowed your car and I just drove there.

797
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:26,120
Scott: Yeah There were occasional times when I needed the car But most of the time I was just moving it back and forth across the street doing nothing.

798
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,745
Scott: And so I got rid of it.

799
00:50:28,247 --> 00:50:31,717
Scott: and I have a friend actually who Lee has the car.

800
00:50:31,738 --> 00:50:32,480
Scott: he lives in New York.

801
00:50:32,802 --> 00:50:38,320
Scott: He leaves the car at his parents house in Connecticut and we're like Why the fuck do you still have that car use it like once in a blue moon?

802
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:41,398
Scott: The parents like take care of the car for him and he's just like what the fuck.

803
00:50:41,418 --> 00:50:51,732
Rym: seriously Really, but at the same time rid of that shit the convenience because there's times when a car be useful Like for example if I wanna go skiing There's like the best way to go skiing like you just got to drive.

804
00:50:51,752 --> 00:51:01,869
Rym: you realize rent a car but renting cars Success because the car rental industry acts like it's still the 90s to this day Like renting cars sucks.

805
00:51:01,909 --> 00:51:04,140
Rym: if I want to say I want to rent a car for the weekend in New York, right?

806
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:04,621
Rym: Sure.

807
00:51:04,902 --> 00:51:05,364
Rym: There's a car.

808
00:51:05,384 --> 00:51:09,000
Rym: There's a million car rental places that I can walk to from our apartment.

809
00:51:09,781 --> 00:51:10,864
Scott: They all give you a car.

810
00:51:11,286 --> 00:51:14,216
Rym: They all close early and they're not open on Sundays.

811
00:51:14,256 --> 00:51:28,839
Rym: if I weren't in a car for a weekend I probably have to rent it in the morning before I go to work and park it somewhere and then go get it when I'm Gonna go to my thing and then I have to drive home on Sunday and then I have to park it somewhere and then pay Because I can't actually drop it off or give it back to them until Monday

812
00:51:29,201 --> 00:51:29,362
Scott: Mm-hmm,

813
00:51:30,447 --> 00:51:31,754
Rym: and also it costs a ton of money.

814
00:51:31,794 --> 00:51:37,280
Rym: renting a car in New York City Costs like eight times more than renting it even a little bit outside of New York.

815
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:40,957
Scott: So there were for a while these services like zipcar which I guess still exists.

816
00:51:41,077 --> 00:51:41,720
Scott: it did barely.

817
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:46,780
Scott: I canceled my zipcar cuz it's garbage now Yeah, but it used to be a big deal for a few years.

818
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:50,316
Scott: You're like we were making use of it and it was totally zipcar used to be literally.

819
00:51:50,336 --> 00:51:51,160
Rym: Oh we need a car.

820
00:51:51,381 --> 00:51:56,560
Rym: I literally was opening up my phone and then pick a car nearby walk over to it.

821
00:51:56,862 --> 00:51:58,353
Rym: We just open and we just drive it.

822
00:51:58,474 --> 00:51:59,160
Rym: We used them all the time.

823
00:51:59,180 --> 00:51:59,621
Rym: They were great.

824
00:52:00,042 --> 00:52:03,232
Scott: and but now all of those services for I don't know what reason.

825
00:52:03,352 --> 00:52:09,989
Rym: I know exactly why I've failed and I know 100% why uber Uber is killed zip.

826
00:52:10,090 --> 00:52:11,060
Rym: I think uber killed zip car.

827
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:15,180
Scott: So are you gonna use an uber to go to the grocery store get groceries and then go back?

828
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:20,746
Scott: So what happened was as far as this is just my opinion or you get one uber to go to the grocery store another uber You to go home.

829
00:52:20,786 --> 00:52:21,658
Rym: Yeah, that's what you do.

830
00:52:22,622 --> 00:52:23,780
Rym: That's cheaper than a zipcars.

831
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:27,979
Rym: The problem was zipcars model was if you need a car for like a few hours use it.

832
00:52:28,421 --> 00:52:33,520
Rym: But as far as I can tell hardly anyone in the city's used it for that because no one needed that.

833
00:52:33,607 --> 00:52:36,911
Scott: No I only I need the car for that's like when I had the car.

834
00:52:37,132 --> 00:52:39,340
Scott: the times I used it were like driving up to Albany.

835
00:52:39,602 --> 00:52:51,684
Scott: Go to my parents house go on a weekend trip go you know like these sorts of things the things that are too long to use a subway or a Car.

836
00:52:51,704 --> 00:52:52,991
Scott: what amaze I don't want to have to park.

837
00:52:53,413 --> 00:52:54,499
Rym: zip car would have made their money.

838
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:59,080
Rym: We have people in New York like using a car every like every week or so for like an hour.

839
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:06,299
Rym: But everyone as far as I can tell when I tried to reserve cars They would reserve them for entire weekends or entire weeks and use it just like a normal rental car.

840
00:53:06,801 --> 00:53:08,929
Rym: Because and I can't stress this enough.

841
00:53:08,969 --> 00:53:11,800
Rym: This is this is like a defining characteristic of Millennials.

842
00:53:11,921 --> 00:53:14,010
Rym: I think I don't want to interact with a human.

843
00:53:14,613 --> 00:53:16,060
Rym: I don't want to go to a physical place.

844
00:53:16,341 --> 00:53:20,862
Rym: I want to go to a website click a thing and then have the service automatically appear Mm-hmm.

845
00:53:21,224 --> 00:53:22,269
Rym: So zip car was great.

846
00:53:22,329 --> 00:53:23,213
Rym: I'd go to a website.

847
00:53:23,414 --> 00:53:24,680
Scott: I was talking to someone today.

848
00:53:25,181 --> 00:53:27,408
Scott: It was like making an eye doctor appointment, right?

849
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:29,294
Scott: They were so afraid.

850
00:53:29,314 --> 00:53:31,300
Scott: They didn't want to talk on the phone to anybody.

851
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:32,845
Rym: Remember Austin, right?

852
00:53:32,966 --> 00:53:36,780
Scott: They were able to make an eye doctor appointment with a new patient.

853
00:53:37,424 --> 00:53:44,080
Scott: Right entirely by going on the internet I you know, then they received a phone call from the eye doctor to confirm the appointment.

854
00:53:44,843 --> 00:53:46,088
Scott: I do all my doctor stuff.

855
00:53:46,108 --> 00:53:47,252
Scott: I don't go to the eye doctor.

856
00:53:47,593 --> 00:53:48,156
Rym: I don't call.

857
00:53:48,216 --> 00:53:49,320
Scott: my doctors are perfect.

858
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:53,076
Rym: I go to a website and I schedule like my dental appointment and it just works automatically.

859
00:53:53,096 --> 00:53:55,731
Rym: I get a calendar invite Otherwise, I'll forget.

860
00:53:55,751 --> 00:53:56,600
Scott: I'm my dentist.

861
00:53:56,700 --> 00:54:02,402
Scott: I made one appointment the first one over the phone and then ever since then you make the appointment for the next appointment on Your way out.

862
00:54:02,663 --> 00:54:04,872
Scott: Yeah, so and then they text me when the thing is.

863
00:54:04,912 --> 00:54:15,780
Rym: and such remembered RIT What Papa John's wasn't good, but when we could order it online We started ordering there almost exclusively just because no one wanted to call on the phone.

864
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:21,340
Scott: The main thing with ordering things like food, especially on the other side doesn't understand you.

865
00:54:21,621 --> 00:54:25,660
Scott: Yeah, you don't have to worry about hearing and the the fuzziness of human language.

866
00:54:25,901 --> 00:54:31,218
Scott: It's like if the order is written down in text, it's like ah, it's exactly right, you know, yep

867
00:54:32,243 --> 00:54:45,100
Rym: But anyway, I hate talking to rental car people when I rent cars at airports like I hate every second of it, but Zip car was great and then people like me only use it on the weekends, which they probably lost money on that proposition.

868
00:54:45,321 --> 00:54:45,643
Rym: so they kept.

869
00:54:45,683 --> 00:54:48,359
Rym: they raised the prices to the point that it was cheaper to rent a regular car.

870
00:54:48,379 --> 00:54:58,455
Rym: and Remember the one time we drove one out to Pennsylvania and then the time the car broke down like we got a flat tire They had to like get someone to fix it for me because that's how their business model worked.

871
00:54:58,555 --> 00:55:01,426
Scott: and they're giving everyone free gas Yeah, and free easy pass.

872
00:55:01,466 --> 00:55:03,755
Scott: I feel like they shouldn't know if it wasn't for easy pass.

873
00:55:03,775 --> 00:55:05,402
Rym: the easy pass pass through to your credit Card.

874
00:55:05,704 --> 00:55:11,091
Scott: Okay, but the free gas I feel like because back then If I get a real rent a car, right?

875
00:55:11,231 --> 00:55:13,760
Scott: It's like I have to fill it with my own gas money.

876
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:15,528
Scott: I don't know why they like easy pack.

877
00:55:15,568 --> 00:55:20,639
Scott: I was I was totally happy to zip car included free gas Oh, you know why they did was very simple shouldn't they have?

878
00:55:21,441 --> 00:55:31,780
Rym: You know made you pay for your own fucking gas because they wanted people to leave them generally full and people would just fill it Up if they just used another credit card and they theoretically baked it into the prize.

879
00:55:31,925 --> 00:55:33,946
Rym: but anyway So they lost.

880
00:55:34,207 --> 00:55:34,648
Rym: all the people.

881
00:55:34,688 --> 00:55:39,608
Rym: all the people who use the service pretty much just used it like I did which wasn't good for Them and anyone who would use it.

882
00:55:39,628 --> 00:55:55,240
Rym: the way that would actually make the money switch to like uber Because uber is cheaper to get a car to drive you to the place car to drive you home then zip car to ran a car for hours in a set amount of time and if you're bringing the car back late to its parking spot you Get in trouble and lose money and all that nonsense.

883
00:55:56,502 --> 00:55:58,294
Rym: So now there's really just no solution.

884
00:55:58,354 --> 00:56:05,299
Rym: people who are Willing to give up on all moral character use uber and I just don't use cars unless I'm absolutely forced to.

885
00:56:05,319 --> 00:56:12,604
Scott: I mean Even regardless of the economic model of the car owning renting Uber in taxi Whatever right.

886
00:56:13,227 --> 00:56:15,194
Scott: using a car hurts the world.

887
00:56:15,234 --> 00:56:17,990
Scott: You're poisoning the air You're burning fuel.

888
00:56:18,071 --> 00:56:19,300
Rym: lying probably hurts your words.

889
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,827
Scott: You're putting your life at risk.

890
00:56:20,888 --> 00:56:22,556
Scott: cars are super dangerous to be in.

891
00:56:22,616 --> 00:56:23,380
Rym: we're going to packs.

892
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:26,080
Rym: It's really way worse for the environment than driving anywhere.

893
00:56:26,662 --> 00:56:31,238
Scott: I'm just saying I get to wait in terms of saying if you care about the earth flying all these care about.

894
00:56:31,279 --> 00:56:31,660
Scott: I mean this.

895
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:34,129
Scott: You know this I'm only doing it occasionally, right?

896
00:56:34,209 --> 00:56:41,225
Scott: Yeah, but that all the people are driving a car fucking every day You're comparing like a short car ride to like Okay, so you're gonna make that argument.

897
00:56:41,265 --> 00:56:43,150
Rym: my counterpoint is without.

898
00:56:43,310 --> 00:56:53,412
Scott: the one flight to packs doesn't pollute the earth more than a person driving their car every day all year without Radically like forcing people to move massive imminent domain everywhere.

899
00:56:53,432 --> 00:56:56,220
Rym: There's no other way to get around in an efficient manner.

900
00:56:56,683 --> 00:57:11,040
Rym: I'm just saying and I think Self-driving cars kind of solve that because if we get to the point to where we ban non self-driving cars Then cars form a grid of information sharing and basically function like mass transit.

901
00:57:11,964 --> 00:57:13,840
Rym: So I feel like the window of humans individually.

902
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:15,964
Scott: Inefficiency of cars.

903
00:57:16,045 --> 00:57:20,200
Scott: and like you take this big old car that could carry four people uses a ton of space.

904
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:23,960
Scott: You're just one person right, but the car is gonna move itself.

905
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,570
Scott: So it's a whole bunch of energy wasted because it's a giant car.

906
00:57:26,972 --> 00:57:29,060
Scott: some people might know one has those tiny cars.

907
00:57:29,421 --> 00:57:30,083
Scott: No one has those.

908
00:57:30,163 --> 00:57:31,447
Scott: Yeah, right motorcycles.

909
00:57:31,467 --> 00:57:31,989
Scott: It's like you're good.

910
00:57:32,310 --> 00:57:32,591
Scott: You're good.

911
00:57:32,992 --> 00:57:35,199
Rym: Yeah, you're just gonna die, but you're good, right?

912
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:38,531
Scott: But you know, so and it's it's super inefficient.

913
00:57:38,571 --> 00:57:44,054
Scott: Like you could have carpooled right the self-driving car It's like a car sitting there not moving for a lot of the time.

914
00:57:44,114 --> 00:57:47,688
Scott: right with self-driving cars You're gonna have the minimum number of needed cars.

915
00:57:47,969 --> 00:57:48,270
Scott: when will?

916
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:51,422
Scott: they'll drive all the trips necessary and no other X plus.

917
00:57:51,442 --> 00:57:54,380
Rym: you could like get rid of traffic lights eventually.

918
00:57:54,601 --> 00:57:58,839
Rym: Cars are just like automatic and efficient and they're just a grid and they just work.

919
00:57:59,181 --> 00:58:01,191
Scott: But anyway, there's also the danger of cars right.

920
00:58:01,432 --> 00:58:03,060
Scott: flying is ridiculously safe.

921
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:06,980
Scott: Yeah, people are super afraid to fly and when they get in a car, they're not afraid at all.

922
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:07,827
Scott: So I gotta get in a car.

923
00:58:07,867 --> 00:58:09,017
Scott: I'm like, oh my god, I'm gonna die.

924
00:58:09,037 --> 00:58:13,457
Scott: Yep I didn't used to be that way, but now it's just like I really thought of that problems.

925
00:58:13,497 --> 00:58:13,878
Scott: that is wise.

926
00:58:14,704 --> 00:58:16,660
Rym: I wasn't sure how this show would go cuz we had no plan.

927
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:17,483
Rym: I was worried we'd you.

928
00:58:17,503 --> 00:58:20,052
Rym: cuz I figured we just get into like anecdotes like cars.

929
00:58:20,092 --> 00:58:24,066
Rym: we owned and things but with Car getting into a car.

930
00:58:24,126 --> 00:58:30,596
Rym: One of the biggest problems I have is that you and I are both Extremely picky about driving technique and safety.

931
00:58:30,616 --> 00:58:38,760
Rym: Mm-hmm And I don't fucking trust like almost anyone I know to drive a car that I'm in let alone like cab.

932
00:58:39,382 --> 00:58:41,310
Scott: I mean, you know Rym doesn't crash.

933
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:43,720
Scott: He said that one time he rear-ended people in the big pile up.

934
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:44,364
Rym: Oh, yeah I got.

935
00:58:44,486 --> 00:58:52,569
Rym: I was in a Massive pile up of the back of my car was smashed in the front of my car was never crashed ever But you backed into a fucking car.

936
00:58:52,729 --> 00:58:53,332
Scott: That was not.

937
00:58:53,533 --> 00:58:54,577
Scott: that's not like a crash.

938
00:58:54,617 --> 00:58:55,440
Scott: That was a crash.

939
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:55,962
Rym: You crashed.

940
00:58:55,982 --> 00:58:57,308
Scott: your car is not like.

941
00:58:57,509 --> 00:58:59,799
Rym: you crashed your car to another car that wasn't even moving.

942
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:06,909
Scott: Extremely tiny parking lot Extremely tiny rationalize.

943
00:59:07,191 --> 00:59:09,120
Scott: I pulled into a spot, right?

944
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:14,620
Scott: I read I ran in I put some quarters in a laundry machine and ran out was in there for less than a minute.

945
00:59:14,786 --> 00:59:17,208
Scott: All right I got in my car and I tried.

946
00:59:17,228 --> 00:59:19,657
Scott: I started backing out when I pulled when I parked.

947
00:59:19,698 --> 00:59:20,220
Rym: we didn't look.

948
00:59:20,722 --> 00:59:23,234
Scott: When I parked there were no other cars in the lot.

949
00:59:23,375 --> 00:59:26,971
Scott: you drove a vehicle in there for one minute.

950
00:59:27,273 --> 00:59:33,060
Rym: you engaged a Multi-toned vehicle to move without looking at what might be in its path.

951
00:59:33,541 --> 00:59:35,227
Scott: I slightly buzzed.

952
00:59:35,247 --> 00:59:36,812
Scott: I was going the speed limit.

953
00:59:36,912 --> 00:59:40,279
Scott: a new car had appeared in like the one minute I was in the laundromat.

954
00:59:40,521 --> 00:59:48,412
Rym: I was going the speed limit on a freeway in tight traffic and I came up over the crest of a hill and there was an accident and cars were stopped and I hit the car in front of me.

955
00:59:48,493 --> 00:59:50,883
Rym: point behind me hit me and the car Behind him hit.

956
00:59:50,903 --> 00:59:52,632
Scott: the point is and Rym drives a car.

957
00:59:52,813 --> 00:59:54,280
Scott: He hits the brake way late.

958
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:57,280
Scott: So you're very uncomfortable to be in the car, even though it's safe.

959
00:59:58,301 --> 00:59:59,245
Rym: Actually, what I do is something.

960
00:59:59,547 --> 01:00:02,840
Scott: I hit the brakes if I see a red light way far away.

961
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:04,609
Scott: I hit the brakes so far in advance.

962
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:14,340
Scott: I accelerate so lightly I grab it's like a. it's a nice very slow curve up to speed and it's curved slowly down.

963
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:14,702
Scott: So there's.

964
01:00:14,742 --> 01:00:17,253
Scott: no you know, the car doesn't move back and forth.

965
01:00:17,293 --> 01:00:18,097
Scott: It's so smooth.

966
01:00:18,137 --> 01:00:22,740
Scott: when I Drive I refuse to accelerate or decelerate rapidly if necessary.

967
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:29,200
Scott: So the real problem is that driving unless it's necessary driving in Rym though speeds up real fast and then stops real fast.

968
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:32,212
Scott: Yeah, you know what driving it is while it is.

969
01:00:32,333 --> 01:00:38,697
Rym: It is very uncomfortable though In the city, that's kind of the only way to drive until you get down to the freeway and freeway.

970
01:00:38,717 --> 01:00:40,846
Rym: just cruise control Just whatever just chill.

971
01:00:41,409 --> 01:00:43,980
Rym: but on the freeway when you say that I'm breaking late.

972
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:47,939
Rym: what I really do is I am hyper averse to an accident like.

973
01:00:47,959 --> 01:00:54,717
Rym: I Do not want to crash my car and I'm like crazy Psychotically focused on not crashing my car.

974
01:00:54,858 --> 01:01:02,475
Rym: Mm-hmm so say I'm on the freeway and I got cruise control on and I'm just chillin and In the lane ahead of me like weaving way ahead.

975
01:01:02,736 --> 01:01:03,440
Rym: I see brake lights.

976
01:01:04,022 --> 01:01:15,880
Rym: I immediately do a quick hard brake to shed a significant amount of speed so that whatever is coming I have shed speed early because the longer you wait the less safe chance you have to shed speed.

977
01:01:16,262 --> 01:01:28,925
Rym: So on the freeway if there's even the hint of trouble ahead I do a short sharp brake to shed a bunch of speed Then assess the situation and then decide if I'm gonna engine brake or hold course or whatever I'm gonna do.

978
01:01:29,005 --> 01:01:35,850
Rym: but I do recognize that that sharp reaction is Uncomfortable for everyone who's in the car except me.

979
01:01:36,070 --> 01:01:37,356
Scott: Yes, don't do that.

980
01:01:37,536 --> 01:01:38,360
Scott: That's bad driving.

981
01:01:39,241 --> 01:01:43,777
Rym: Anyway cars suck and I hope that no human is allowed to drive cars on any public street.

982
01:01:43,877 --> 01:01:45,424
Rym: at some point in my life People seen that.

983
01:01:45,444 --> 01:01:46,772
Scott: so the self-driving car right.

984
01:01:46,853 --> 01:01:53,120
Scott: people seem to have this idea Like if the cars aren't perfectly safe if they ever hit anyone then we can't use them yet.

985
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:55,349
Rym: So you humans already drive like shit, right?

986
01:01:55,429 --> 01:01:58,000
Rym: I would trust current self-driving cars over most of you.

987
01:01:58,020 --> 01:01:59,893
Scott: That is totally totally stupid.

988
01:01:59,933 --> 01:02:00,920
Scott: Here's how it works, right?

989
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:06,477
Scott: Let's say a human driving a car has a 10% chair every every 10 trips.

990
01:02:06,557 --> 01:02:07,540
Scott: They're gonna have accident.

991
01:02:07,620 --> 01:02:08,927
Scott: Obviously that's way high.

992
01:02:08,987 --> 01:02:11,460
Scott: but you know, I'm just using made-up numbers, right?

993
01:02:11,862 --> 01:02:14,520
Rym: Look at all the dents in cars parked in New York, right?

994
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:19,139
Scott: but the point is let's say a person driving a car has a 1 in 10 chance of an accident, right.

995
01:02:19,159 --> 01:02:29,688
Scott: if if the self-driving car has a 0.9 in 10 chance of an accident if it's even a fraction Safer than a person it's still flawed.

996
01:02:30,350 --> 01:02:41,042
Scott: if it's at if it's even a fraction safer than a human Multiplied by all the trips made in cars and all the miles driven that adds up to less people dying Yep.

997
01:02:41,082 --> 01:02:43,150
Rym: Now you can't even point.

998
01:02:43,330 --> 01:02:45,820
Scott: Oh, oh one percent safer than a person.

999
01:02:46,104 --> 01:02:47,300
Scott: It doesn't have to be a hundred percent.

1000
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,127
Scott: See if it's one.

1001
01:02:49,208 --> 01:03:03,060
Scott: if it's a fraction of a percent safer than a person driving Added up over all the trips and all the cars all over the world Many many many many lives will be saved and the fact is they're not a fraction of a percent safer than a person.

1002
01:03:03,322 --> 01:03:05,659
Scott: They're drastic even in their current shitty state.

1003
01:03:06,001 --> 01:03:07,646
Rym: So they are in some degrees.

1004
01:03:08,027 --> 01:03:11,900
Rym: but on the other hand there's certain kinds of situations still that they don't handle at all.

1005
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:14,227
Rym: Yes that a human would but well even so.

1006
01:03:14,448 --> 01:03:21,253
Scott: but even they are still in their current shitty form as shitty as it is drastically safer than a human.

1007
01:03:21,293 --> 01:03:22,781
Scott: because like in those states They don't know.

1008
01:03:22,842 --> 01:03:23,444
Scott: you're not.

1009
01:03:23,484 --> 01:03:24,146
Rym: when we say human.

1010
01:03:24,166 --> 01:03:25,952
Rym: We're not saying like someone who's a good driver.

1011
01:03:25,992 --> 01:03:27,517
Rym: We're saying the average driver.

1012
01:03:27,557 --> 01:03:36,379
Rym: Yes even in Weird situations where the driving test consists of did you knock down less than 50% of the cones you're good to go, right?

1013
01:03:37,742 --> 01:03:41,620
Scott: Even in those situations those self-driving cars are likely to just sit there doing nothing.

1014
01:03:41,962 --> 01:03:44,340
Scott: They're not like gonna drive around like crazy hitting people, right?

1015
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:52,592
Rym: So well, so there is a counter danger self-driving cars Probably because of shitty Internet of Things security.

1016
01:03:53,054 --> 01:03:54,360
Rym: probably really easy to hack.

1017
01:03:55,404 --> 01:03:58,740
Rym: Different scenario, but I think that actually might be a big danger.

1018
01:03:58,981 --> 01:04:03,700
Rym: Yes, but because if you're gonna assassinate someone, yeah, the car doors won't open and the car just drives off a cliff.

1019
01:04:04,002 --> 01:04:07,624
Scott: yes, that is true, but Given those numbers.

1020
01:04:08,306 --> 01:04:16,160
Scott: I think it's amoral to allow people to drive and to not immediately say you're starting right now All cars must be self-driving counterpoint.

1021
01:04:16,601 --> 01:04:19,288
Scott: It would be more killing people by not doing that.

1022
01:04:19,308 --> 01:04:29,628
Rym: you would kill people if you made that mandate without buying everyone a self-driving car Because the people who'd be hurt most by that are poor people who need to drive to get to their job because of the shitty Way our society set up.

1023
01:04:29,688 --> 01:04:34,580
Scott: you just make it so that all new cars You don't you can't just take say everyone has to throw out your car now, right?

1024
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:35,746
Scott: It's a waste of resources, right?
