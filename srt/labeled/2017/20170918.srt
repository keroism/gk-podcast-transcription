1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,490
Rym: It's Monday September 18th 2017.

2
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,032
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,172 --> 00:00:15,101
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:15,422 --> 00:00:18,070
Rym: We're not talking about portable electricity.

5
00:00:19,931 --> 00:00:20,947
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:22,811 --> 00:00:27,745
Rym: So yesterday kind of something Emily and I started doing is every fall give or take.

7
00:00:27,785 --> 00:00:29,509
Rym: it's kind of random exactly when we do it.

8
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:35,250
Rym: But we head upstate to a place called breakneck Ridge, which is not named after a hiker who broke his neck.

9
00:00:36,014 --> 00:00:42,564
Scott: It's named after a bull who broke its neck By falling off the cliff just like a hiker is likely to do so.

10
00:00:42,604 --> 00:00:46,720
Rym: the as the legend goes The people of Cold Spring.

11
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,350
Rym: there was a bull that was terrorizing the farmland.

12
00:00:50,052 --> 00:00:59,690
Rym: So they got a bunch of farmers together and they chased it up breakneck Ridge and off breakneck Ridge Killing it and then they named breakneck Ridge breakneck Ridge.

13
00:00:59,871 --> 00:01:02,420
Scott: Why not kill bull Ridge or falling bull?

14
00:01:02,782 --> 00:01:08,429
Rym: Well the boat the mound on the other side of the river It's called Mount Taurus I believe not on the other side of the river.

15
00:01:08,671 --> 00:01:14,619
Scott: Storm King is on the other side of the river but everything on the other side of the river is based on animals bear Mountain bull mountain.

16
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,809
Scott: Yeah horse mountain, but So what we usually do is we get off the train mountain.

17
00:01:20,191 --> 00:01:27,069
Rym: Metro North in New York has this cool thing where there's a couple of stations that aren't an actual full strain station They're just a wooden platform.

18
00:01:27,471 --> 00:01:34,394
Rym: That's like not even that big and some trains will stop at these little wooden platforms usually request No, you don't.

19
00:01:34,474 --> 00:01:36,201
Rym: actually it's for a long time.

20
00:01:36,522 --> 00:01:42,149
Rym: In fact at the stand of the exact right door Yep, and they they announced when the trains about to leave like where it is.

21
00:01:42,515 --> 00:01:46,808
Rym: but anyway So breakneck Ridge is one of those stations and it used to be.

22
00:01:47,471 --> 00:01:52,450
Rym: There'd be like two trains that stop there on the way up and two trains that stop there on the way down only on side.

23
00:01:52,450 --> 00:02:03,387
Rym: It's Saturday and Sunday But when we went this time and we do this all the time like this is a regular trip we do There were like six trains instead of the usual to a lot of people going.

24
00:02:03,889 --> 00:02:08,949
Rym: yeah so a lot of people are starting to do this way more than used to.

25
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:15,230
Rym: Like tons of people get off at breakneck Ridge to the point that now there's all these porta-potties set up like at the station.

26
00:02:15,852 --> 00:02:21,710
Rym: There's like a tent set up at the trailhead with like maps and it's only sure there's a Metro North ticket machine.

27
00:02:22,751 --> 00:02:24,459
Rym: No, but you can just buy tickets on the train.

28
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:26,307
Rym: So obviously bless who buys tickets.

29
00:02:26,327 --> 00:02:27,050
Rym: You have a smartphone app.

30
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:33,010
Rym: I'm amazed how many people I see like in beacon frantically buying tickets at the station before the train comes.

31
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:39,650
Scott: Hilarious when I'm in Grand Central and there's a line of people on the weekend at the ticket room with all the machines.

32
00:02:39,735 --> 00:02:53,910
Scott: Yeah and right next to the entrance to the ticket room is a giant sign that says buy your ticket with this app and it has the URL to go get the app and everything and you see someone standing with a smartphone waiting in line with the sign next to them.

33
00:02:54,812 --> 00:02:57,782
Rym: It is trivial to buy a ticket on the app.

34
00:02:57,862 --> 00:02:58,625
Rym: it just works.

35
00:02:58,685 --> 00:03:00,330
Scott: though, there's a woman supports Apple pay.

36
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:00,893
Scott: Just go.

37
00:03:00,933 --> 00:03:04,030
Rym: there's a weird bug with the app that I found it has not affected.

38
00:03:04,071 --> 00:03:05,369
Scott: Did you find a way to get a free ticket?

39
00:03:06,091 --> 00:03:17,820
Rym: No, so whenever I buy a ticket right now and I show it the time it shows on the app for what time it is now and when I bought the ticket is In the Utah time zone.

40
00:03:18,302 --> 00:03:19,650
Scott: Oh, cuz you're stuck in the wrong time zone.

41
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,759
Rym: No, but my phone is not in that time zone.

42
00:03:21,779 --> 00:03:25,970
Scott: now my phone is definitely in the right time So my phone does not have this problem.

43
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:29,480
Rym: Uh, yeah, so my phone shows the time the correct time.

44
00:03:30,062 --> 00:03:32,810
Rym: only the Metro North app shows the wrong time.

45
00:03:33,031 --> 00:03:34,136
Scott: Yeah, well iPhones don't have this.

46
00:03:34,277 --> 00:03:34,981
Rym: no other Apple.

47
00:03:35,202 --> 00:03:36,690
Rym: You don't know that you haven't been to Salt Lake City.

48
00:03:37,732 --> 00:03:39,190
Scott: I've been to Seattle.

49
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:44,190
Rym: Yeah So have I. and when I went to Seattle because I've used this app before it did not happen.

50
00:03:44,411 --> 00:03:49,170
Rym: It only happened after I went to Salt Lake City your phone your phone has been touched by Mormons.

51
00:03:49,592 --> 00:03:50,495
Rym: Yeah, something like that.

52
00:03:50,556 --> 00:03:51,118
Rym: It's weird.

53
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,050
Rym: But so we did the hike and it's a metro north.

54
00:03:54,371 --> 00:03:58,130
Rym: It's an extremely strenuous and difficult hike and it takes us about six hours.

55
00:03:58,292 --> 00:04:04,568
Rym: if you do the Schofield Ridge it takes like three hours if you don't just go field Ridge because Schofield Ridge is actually way.

56
00:04:04,628 --> 00:04:06,696
Rym: it's a Surprisingly difficult hike over there.

57
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:09,166
Rym: But anyway, we did the hike and everything was fine.

58
00:04:09,226 --> 00:04:15,910
Rym: We went back to Beacon and The place where I once almost it was an abandoned building.

59
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:19,309
Rym: There's a lot of abandoned factories all over Beacon that I broke into almost all of them.

60
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:22,826
Rym: Most of them have been turned into fancy loft apartments now.

61
00:04:23,088 --> 00:04:25,553
Scott: that makes sense Gentrification.

62
00:04:25,654 --> 00:04:26,922
Scott: we were there before it was cool.

63
00:04:26,942 --> 00:04:28,089
Scott: We left before it was uncool.

64
00:04:28,129 --> 00:04:35,820
Rym: now It got cool like way cool, but Beacon just in the last like six months Gentrified to a degree that is surprising.

65
00:04:36,101 --> 00:04:39,270
Rym: even knowing that they already built all these crazy lofts and all those old fact.

66
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,029
Scott: It was slightly gentrifying when we were there.

67
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:44,210
Scott: Like they started opening up more restaurants and stuff as we left.

68
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:54,525
Rym: So so many people get on the train to go from Beacon back to the city on a Sunday evening that the train completely filled Mmm, and even the conductor was like, yeah, this has been a problem.

69
00:04:54,946 --> 00:04:55,709
Rym: I don't know what to do.

70
00:04:56,552 --> 00:04:56,853
Rym: Good luck.

71
00:04:56,873 --> 00:04:57,334
Rym: Have fun.

72
00:04:57,354 --> 00:04:58,217
Rym: You're gonna get to stand.

73
00:04:58,257 --> 00:05:00,143
Scott: probably good move moving.

74
00:05:00,685 --> 00:05:08,430
Rym: and on Main Street now There's a giant apartment building being built where like on Main Street used to be right in the middle.

75
00:05:08,992 --> 00:05:12,350
Rym: No Main Street is like way different from what you remember.

76
00:05:12,751 --> 00:05:15,259
Rym: It's all fancy bars fancy restaurants.

77
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,868
Rym: Like when we lived in beacons a sushi place still there.

78
00:05:17,908 --> 00:05:19,855
Rym: Yeah, of course it is All right, what was a floor?

79
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:23,830
Rym: was an upscale or were there even upscale restaurants in Beacon?

80
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,438
Scott: There was the sushi place that was not upscale.

81
00:05:26,498 --> 00:05:27,521
Scott: It was for a while.

82
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:30,190
Scott: There was cafe Maya, which was again not upscale.

83
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:30,933
Rym: That was just nice.

84
00:05:30,973 --> 00:05:31,736
Scott: the suko Thai.

85
00:05:31,796 --> 00:05:32,600
Scott: Fuck you suko Thai.

86
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:32,981
Rym: Fuck you.

87
00:05:33,001 --> 00:05:33,564
Rym: They're still there.

88
00:05:33,724 --> 00:05:37,258
Scott: Fuck you, but was there The.

89
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:41,192
Rym: was there a restaurant in Beacon that you would consider fancy Like?

90
00:05:41,232 --> 00:05:42,797
Scott: what level of fanciness I mean?

91
00:05:42,817 --> 00:05:46,870
Rym: because the sushi place wasn't unfancy, uh, like any of the places in Vernon Jackson?

92
00:05:48,551 --> 00:05:50,235
Scott: No, not not it was.

93
00:05:50,356 --> 00:05:59,048
Scott: there was no place that was like, you know a place that someone wear nice clothing - so You could wear nice clothing suko Thai if you wanted to but fuck now.

94
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:02,304
Rym: now We only if you wanted a fancy like quote-unquote upscale place.

95
00:06:02,344 --> 00:06:03,550
Rym: He went to like fish kill or something.

96
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:08,947
Rym: There's like three upscale restaurants in Beacon now, they're building so many apartments.

97
00:06:08,987 --> 00:06:15,670
Rym: the craziest thing There's a giant construction going on right now right next to the train station big apartment building.

98
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:29,497
Rym: It looks like where we're next to the train station Like, you know when you go up the road toward where we used to live and there's all those like old Like condos those white condos right there Like in a place that was just woods before.

99
00:06:29,517 --> 00:06:31,844
Rym: it's just gigantic apartment building.

100
00:06:32,186 --> 00:06:36,530
Scott: Okay, so yeah Someone bought the woods I feel like I Got.

101
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:42,590
Rym: I'm gonna look at some real estate prices in Beacon because of all the upstate places Beacon actually has the most investment value.

102
00:06:43,232 --> 00:06:44,116
Scott: That is a little late.

103
00:06:44,136 --> 00:06:46,184
Scott: You could have you missed your chance on that one.

104
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:56,018
Rym: See while I think it is late it's still not too late because the buildings they're building is like Gonna add 20% more housing to Beacon.

105
00:06:56,038 --> 00:07:00,210
Scott: Yeah, I was thinking like further out cheaper, but also larger.

106
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:07,490
Rym: So Beacon will larger than Beacon name a town that's larger than Beacon not the town being larger the property that we buy.

107
00:07:08,651 --> 00:07:17,806
Rym: So anyway, I realize if you want to say if the house isn't next to a metro-north station It's also on a lake and unless it's next to a metro-north station.

108
00:07:17,826 --> 00:07:18,750
Rym: It's worthless and I'm out.

109
00:07:18,931 --> 00:07:20,218
Scott: I don't care if it's worth listen.

110
00:07:20,278 --> 00:07:21,685
Scott: It's I want to store stuff.

111
00:07:21,705 --> 00:07:22,550
Rym: No, it's not useful.

112
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:24,574
Rym: If I can't just take a train to it I don't care.

113
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:25,379
Scott: I can get a car.

114
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:27,150
Scott: if I have a house I have a car and go there.

115
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,799
Rym: We're gonna keep the car down here.

116
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,509
Rym: you can leave it there leave it there.

117
00:07:30,952 --> 00:07:33,370
Rym: So how are you gonna get to the house to then use the car?

118
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:35,716
Scott: Amanda has a car.

119
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,078
Rym: Ah Yeah, it's all you.

120
00:07:38,138 --> 00:07:43,130
Scott: if you don't want to be in a town that has metro-north If you're a town that has metro-north it cost too much money and that defeats the purpose.

121
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:47,549
Rym: But it still cost way less than you think Cause way too much money.

122
00:07:48,713 --> 00:07:49,668
Rym: How much is too much money?

123
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,374
Scott: Like too much money.

124
00:07:52,394 --> 00:07:53,418
Scott: All right more.

125
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:56,307
Scott: I sought to continue to pay New York rent if I didn't right.

126
00:07:56,347 --> 00:08:00,000
Rym: cuz that's check That Pete sent us a link to was still like a hundred and fifty.

127
00:08:00,362 --> 00:08:00,984
Scott: That's really cheap.

128
00:08:01,366 --> 00:08:02,530
Rym: Yeah, but it's a shack.

129
00:08:03,172 --> 00:08:07,528
Rym: It's a cabin in the woods with generator power, but it has an enormous amount of land.

130
00:08:07,628 --> 00:08:17,791
Scott: I've seen houses with two stories and Sewer, well, maybe not sewers but electricity and phones and internet and whatnot on a lake for 150.

131
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:21,264
Scott: No, they were just dilapidated crappy houses, but they were still houses.

132
00:08:21,465 --> 00:08:30,050
Rym: So but beacon is Gentrified and growing to a degree that was shocking to me who already had the impression that it was gentrifying rapidly.

133
00:08:30,451 --> 00:08:33,822
Rym: Something changed in the last like three to six months.

134
00:08:33,922 --> 00:08:36,289
Scott: Oh, what's what's we instead of going to beacon?

135
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,150
Scott: Think about what's gonna be the next beacon?

136
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:41,904
Rym: I think it's gonna be it more like town has just gentrified with his.

137
00:08:41,985 --> 00:08:43,130
Rym: here's what I think is gonna happen.

138
00:08:43,611 --> 00:08:48,349
Rym: Beacon is gonna fuck like cold spring and all the towns near it.

139
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:56,898
Rym: That because they don't have local economies like vegan does Cold spring I don't think can be fucked.

140
00:08:56,939 --> 00:08:57,641
Scott: It's got money.

141
00:08:58,022 --> 00:09:00,130
Scott: Yeah, but cold air is in his super mansions.

142
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:00,893
Scott: They don't give a shit.

143
00:09:00,953 --> 00:09:04,145
Rym: Cold spring is like just commuter town as a put.

144
00:09:04,185 --> 00:09:06,696
Scott: like people people who live there They're giving you say about the train.

145
00:09:06,716 --> 00:09:08,122
Scott: Why not croaty croaty croats?

146
00:09:08,685 --> 00:09:11,055
Rym: Hey Curtis not that nice.

147
00:09:11,075 --> 00:09:12,461
Rym: There's not there's nothing there.

148
00:09:12,662 --> 00:09:13,364
Scott: It's not about what.

149
00:09:13,405 --> 00:09:15,975
Scott: you're only going to your own house Doing anything else there.

150
00:09:15,995 --> 00:09:19,169
Scott: No, we're at a beacon house that do stuff going to just to go to your house.

151
00:09:19,531 --> 00:09:21,742
Scott: If I want to do stuff, I live in New York City.

152
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:23,130
Scott: I don't need to go somewhere to do stuff.

153
00:09:23,431 --> 00:09:25,059
Scott: I'm going somewhere to put my stuff.

154
00:09:25,461 --> 00:09:27,270
Scott: so my apartment in the city could have no stuff.

155
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:28,541
Rym: So anyway, we got any.

156
00:09:28,561 --> 00:09:29,530
Rym: tech news is Monday.

157
00:09:29,771 --> 00:09:40,630
Scott: There's tons of tech news because we delayed because Apple was inconvenient with their timing this this Apple day Yeah, and so Apple Day was like two weeks ago, but GeekNights is today.

158
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:45,790
Scott: So we held on to the Apple news and somehow did not forget it and also didn't use it on a non Monday.

159
00:09:45,911 --> 00:09:46,554
Scott: Good job us.

160
00:09:47,157 --> 00:09:49,970
Scott: All right, so let's let's go Apple news real quick.

161
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:52,980
Scott: Number one new Apple TV does 4k.

162
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,686
Scott: fuck the Apple TV TV.

163
00:09:54,786 --> 00:09:55,488
Scott: I break its back.

164
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:56,010
Scott: make it humble.

165
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:58,886
Scott: It sucks chrome cast and it still sucked.

166
00:09:58,906 --> 00:10:05,630
Scott: the Apple TV Costs more than all the competing products like Chromecast and fire stick and I think the fire sticks actually be canceled.

167
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,158
Rym: but yet it does less.

168
00:10:07,298 --> 00:10:11,812
Scott: it does less than all of those and It's big.

169
00:10:11,953 --> 00:10:17,930
Scott: you can just get a computer that does a raspberry pie is like cheaper and better than Apple TV and does more.

170
00:10:18,431 --> 00:10:31,883
Scott: Right, there is no reason to buy Apple TV for anyone even I guess if your whole life is Apple and you only do Apple things and you're only interested in doing things Apple TV does then you're paying more to get a Maybe nicer user interface.

171
00:10:31,903 --> 00:10:37,970
Scott: Well like on it If you're the kind of person who's buying movies on iTunes, then maybe Apple TV is good for you.

172
00:10:39,292 --> 00:10:41,564
Rym: That's everyone I knew used FaceTime.

173
00:10:41,845 --> 00:10:53,050
Scott: then that would be a better if it's literally the only thing connected to your TV because you don't Right, but the thing is I always use this analogy and I'm gonna keep using this analogy because I still believe in it, right?

174
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:56,543
Scott: Here's someone who lives in a town and you never leave the town.

175
00:10:56,784 --> 00:10:58,150
Scott: So you say who needs a car?

176
00:10:58,511 --> 00:10:59,635
Scott: I never need to leave town.

177
00:10:59,675 --> 00:11:00,619
Scott: I've never left town.

178
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:01,783
Scott: Why would I buy a car?

179
00:11:01,864 --> 00:11:02,044
Scott: Right?

180
00:11:02,185 --> 00:11:03,550
Scott: I only need to do things in the town.

181
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:09,537
Scott: I'll stick with my bicycle and then one day someone forces you to leave town And you realize what you've been missing.

182
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:13,472
Scott: and now you see why it was stupid to not have the car and leave town Right?

183
00:11:13,492 --> 00:11:15,200
Scott: That's what an Apple TV user is like.

184
00:11:15,522 --> 00:11:17,170
Scott: I only do things that Apple TV does.

185
00:11:17,412 --> 00:11:19,750
Scott: I'm never gonna need to play emulated games on my computer.

186
00:11:20,031 --> 00:11:24,410
Scott: I'm never gonna need to watch a video on my computer that the Apple TV won't watch for some reason.

187
00:11:24,811 --> 00:11:25,915
Scott: I'm never gonna need to do this.

188
00:11:25,975 --> 00:11:28,504
Scott: and that because I only do the Apple TV things.

189
00:11:28,925 --> 00:11:34,789
Scott: if you did the other fucking things Because you use something that wasn't Apple TV you'd realize how shitty the Apple TV was.

190
00:11:34,809 --> 00:11:36,094
Scott: now It doesn't fucking do anything.

191
00:11:36,114 --> 00:11:40,590
Rym: All right, so the Apple TV, so I watch three will.

192
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:43,680
Rym: Really once Scott gets his then we'll talk about it.

193
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:48,470
Scott: I ordered it so I get to go get it on Friday But as far as I don't want to talk about it too much.

194
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:51,630
Rym: But the main reason the only feature it has is you can put a SIM card in it, right?

195
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:54,500
Scott: Well, no, it has an electronic SIM card built into it.

196
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,109
Rym: Okay, so I can have a SIM card in it.

197
00:11:58,571 --> 00:11:58,873
Scott: Yes.

198
00:11:59,034 --> 00:11:59,356
Scott: Yes.

199
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:01,170
Rym: It has its own data plan, right?

200
00:12:01,772 --> 00:12:02,776
Scott: Well, it uses your own.

201
00:12:02,796 --> 00:12:04,202
Scott: it uses your data plan.

202
00:12:04,222 --> 00:12:06,410
Scott: you pay ten dollars extra a month in the u.s.

203
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,790
Scott: But actually in every other country it cost more than yeah.

204
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:18,797
Scott: But anyway, so yeah The main reasons I got it were it's not they didn't redesign it and make it thinner and better Which is sad right because that's what I was really waiting for.

205
00:12:18,817 --> 00:12:22,367
Scott: Yeah, but you know the pebble not supported anymore.

206
00:12:22,387 --> 00:12:22,427
Scott: Go.

207
00:12:22,828 --> 00:12:23,009
Scott: Bye.

208
00:12:23,049 --> 00:12:24,740
Scott: Bye And it's not.

209
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,930
Rym: pebble still working a lot better.

210
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:35,352
Rym: But I've noticed online just sort of a. this is purely just a sampling like self-selected sample people I know who use primarily iPhone.

211
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:44,290
Rym: their pebble has been degrading or working less and less Well has always worked less with iPhone than with and with but on Android it's still working like a champ, right?

212
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,076
Scott: But like there are lots of notifications.

213
00:12:46,136 --> 00:12:50,210
Scott: I'll get that won't be on my watch and then suddenly I'll get a notification on my watch.

214
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,176
Scott: It's very inconsistent.

215
00:12:51,196 --> 00:12:53,089
Rym: Yeah, I'm not now I'm having no problems like that.

216
00:12:54,352 --> 00:12:56,661
Scott: Anyway, but I mean my pebble time still works.

217
00:12:56,701 --> 00:12:58,670
Scott: if anyone wants a pebble time, let me know.

218
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:02,363
Rym: It's pretty much the second best smartphone in the world the best one being the pebble time.

219
00:13:02,463 --> 00:13:04,290
Rym: steal our watch my watch anyway.

220
00:13:06,031 --> 00:13:10,810
Scott: So the other thing with the new Apple watch is they added this supposedly?

221
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:14,101
Scott: Advanced better heart monitoring something now.

222
00:13:14,944 --> 00:13:16,330
Scott: I don't know if that's bullshit or not.

223
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:17,627
Scott: I'm gonna find out and let you know.

224
00:13:17,913 --> 00:13:20,609
Scott: No, of course I don't even know if I'd be able to tell because I'm not a doctor.

225
00:13:21,273 --> 00:13:26,456
Scott: But if it has any merit whatsoever Right, you got to figure.

226
00:13:26,496 --> 00:13:30,410
Scott: heart disease kills the most people of anything in our part of the world.

227
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,079
Scott: That is the number one killer.

228
00:13:32,099 --> 00:13:33,124
Scott: more than car accident.

229
00:13:33,466 --> 00:13:34,210
Scott: more than anything.

230
00:13:34,311 --> 00:13:37,429
Scott: Of course a lot of the heart disease deaths are from smoking which I don't do.

231
00:13:38,212 --> 00:13:42,428
Scott: But besides the point it's still the thing most likely to kill Scott is heart disease.

232
00:13:42,508 --> 00:13:42,950
Rym: pretty much.

233
00:13:43,010 --> 00:14:02,386
Scott: So if this Apple watch can in any way Even remotely provide any sort of valid information that may help to detect heart disease early and keep me alive somewhat longer right then the five whatever four or five hundred dollars it cost is Basically, that's too cheap.

234
00:14:03,216 --> 00:14:05,134
Scott: But also if it's true It could just be bullshit.

235
00:14:05,155 --> 00:14:05,858
Rym: forget your life.

236
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:09,434
Rym: even an exact even like the fact that I you know I wanted the new pebble.

237
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:11,300
Rym: that never came out because pebble is gone.

238
00:14:11,501 --> 00:14:13,106
Rym: Yeah, but it had a heart rate monitor.

239
00:14:13,126 --> 00:14:16,570
Rym: I don't even want Necessarily accurate information.

240
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:26,682
Rym: I just want consistent information from the same source to use in my stat tracking because if you use Strava or something for exercise like when I Bike and ski and you can you can start and stop.

241
00:14:26,702 --> 00:14:30,321
Scott: your Strava runs from your Apple watch Of course, which I can do from my pebble.

242
00:14:30,361 --> 00:14:31,226
Scott: my pebble doesn't do that.

243
00:14:31,628 --> 00:14:35,446
Rym: Wow iPhone and pebble does really didn't work with me which me?

244
00:14:35,486 --> 00:14:38,600
Scott: well no it works It's just the iPhone just worked on.

245
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:44,409
Scott: my pebble like iOS does not Have all of the Bluetooth things like open.

246
00:14:44,852 --> 00:14:53,045
Rym: I always doesn't have all of the NFC stuff like if you want to use a separate External security token like a yubikey NFC on your iPhone.

247
00:14:53,085 --> 00:14:53,667
Rym: It just won't work.

248
00:14:53,707 --> 00:14:54,610
Rym: It only works on Android.

249
00:14:54,711 --> 00:14:55,113
Scott: Yeah, they don't.

250
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,520
Scott: they don't really have NFC.

251
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,390
Scott: that they you know, they don't allow that.

252
00:14:58,742 --> 00:15:03,210
Scott: Yeah Cuz they want to charge you for making Apple accessories and we want you to use Apple stuff, right?

253
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:05,650
Scott: You like they didn't even do Bluetooth headphones anymore.

254
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:10,710
Scott: They got like their Apple X headphone thing, which is admittedly better than Bluetooth headphone.

255
00:15:11,173 --> 00:15:13,185
Scott: But you have to buy headphones that use it.

256
00:15:13,226 --> 00:15:13,910
Scott: You can't just buy any.

257
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:22,936
Rym: so the trouble is on one hand like I like my smartwatch partly because it makes it easy for me to do sports like when I'm running and The having a smartwatch.

258
00:15:22,996 --> 00:15:28,997
Rym: even the old iPhone - I watch - would do this but you start to carry your phone with you That had independent GPS.

259
00:15:29,037 --> 00:15:31,906
Rym: you could theoretically get the data without the watch.

260
00:15:32,368 --> 00:15:34,276
Rym: the problem You're like you don't need the data plan.

261
00:15:34,296 --> 00:15:37,690
Rym: You'll get the GPS data because you don't need the data plan for GPS, right?

262
00:15:38,051 --> 00:15:48,529
Rym: The problem is Emily's tried that and the GPS and the I've watched appears to suck ass Mmm, like it's way less accurate and shitty if you don't have an iPhone with you.

263
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:53,243
Rym: I wonder if the iPhone 3 I watch 3 has improved the GPS.

264
00:15:53,444 --> 00:15:54,747
Scott: I wonder we'll find out.

265
00:15:54,808 --> 00:15:56,753
Scott: I've never used the GPS.

266
00:15:56,914 --> 00:16:08,862
Rym: I think oh, I just want to carry my watch but when I go for long runs runs I actually want my phone with me because I might take a break and I want to read the internet The internet and I watch yeah on that tiny ass screen.

267
00:16:08,882 --> 00:16:09,363
Rym: No, thank you.

268
00:16:09,384 --> 00:16:10,950
Scott: Hey Siri, tell me what the news is.

269
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:12,759
Rym: Yeah, do you actually do that?

270
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:14,690
Rym: Or do you want to just read Twitter on a real screen?

271
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:18,490
Scott: I watch my might want to do it instead of yeah I'm the you know Cuz.

272
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:24,870
Rym: I just just leave my head if you regularly read long parts of a timeline or long news articles on your watch?

273
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:28,890
Scott: Well, I imagine if I'm biking I could just like hey Siri read me the something.

274
00:16:29,332 --> 00:16:30,657
Rym: Yeah, but that's not what I do.

275
00:16:30,938 --> 00:16:32,203
Rym: I stop after running like 10.

276
00:16:32,203 --> 00:16:33,930
Scott: Yeah, so I don't run.

277
00:16:34,311 --> 00:16:35,094
Scott: Running is tiring.

278
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:46,367
Rym: or I stop in Rockaway after I biked and I want to just sit and read the news while I eat a hot Dog, you know that on your watch also I like to look at a large map to navigate and plan if I'm running somewhere.

279
00:16:46,407 --> 00:16:47,190
Rym: I've never been before.

280
00:16:47,772 --> 00:16:50,505
Scott: Anyway, we'll find out how good it is, right?

281
00:16:50,545 --> 00:16:51,188
Scott: I still need to.

282
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:54,237
Scott: you know I still need the functionality the pebble gives only better.

283
00:16:54,257 --> 00:16:56,944
Scott: Yeah, and the iWatch is gonna give that.

284
00:16:57,084 --> 00:17:00,534
Rym: so I don't think the iPhone 8 Does anything like.

285
00:17:00,574 --> 00:17:01,076
Rym: I guess I don't know.

286
00:17:01,096 --> 00:17:11,829
Scott: I think what they realize somehow is that like cuz he I bought the iPhone 3g The four the five the six and the seven right every two year and I realized aha this these s phones are bullshit.

287
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:14,630
Scott: Why would you pay money to upgrade from like five to five s?

288
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,115
Rym: Ah, but isn't the iPhone 8?

289
00:17:16,115 --> 00:17:18,646
Rym: even this article is like it feels like it's just the 7s, right?

290
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,415
Scott: It's barely better.

291
00:17:20,476 --> 00:17:21,821
Scott: So then they went from six.

292
00:17:21,963 --> 00:17:23,430
Scott: I don't think they made success, right?

293
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,940
Rym: It was six seven if I don't even remember.

294
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,490
Scott: there might have been success, but they went from seven to eight.

295
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:29,776
Scott: There's no 7s, right?

296
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:32,530
Scott: They realized what I they they trying to fool me.

297
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:38,850
Scott: They're like, ah, haha Scott won't know if we don't put the s that this is just a minor increment and not an actual upgrade.

298
00:17:39,312 --> 00:17:40,599
Scott: But you're not fooling anyone.

299
00:17:40,639 --> 00:17:42,890
Scott: you release the iPhone X at the same goddamn time.

300
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:46,402
Rym: So so meanwhile the iPhone X. here's the thing that I gotta get out before I get anything out.

301
00:17:46,422 --> 00:17:46,542
Rym: Mm-hmm.

302
00:17:47,265 --> 00:17:49,891
Rym: I don't like the Continued.

303
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:54,810
Rym: let's make a weird aspect ratio or have weird no-go areas on the screen for you.

304
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,783
Scott: I don't really care about that so much.

305
00:17:56,964 --> 00:18:00,082
Scott: from a design The way I see it is the phone is not.

306
00:18:00,183 --> 00:18:01,490
Scott: any bit is just the right.

307
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:05,090
Scott: It's basically the regular size of iPhone 7 which is only slightly too big.

308
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:11,110
Scott: Yeah Yet the screen is as big as the iPhone 7 plus screen true because it's the whole fucking thing.

309
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,375
Scott: You got rid of those other areas.

310
00:18:12,696 --> 00:18:16,390
Scott: So you're getting the giant and normal screen without the giant and normal phone.

311
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:17,577
Scott: That's a good.

312
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,045
Scott: the screen is better.

313
00:18:19,106 --> 00:18:19,830
Scott: It's ridiculous.

314
00:18:20,811 --> 00:18:30,560
Rym: Sane resolution two different UX articles from people who make iPhone apps talking about how that bar area and Slightly changing aspect ratios is increasingly.

315
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:33,430
Scott: the bar area of course drives designer people crazy.

316
00:18:34,832 --> 00:18:36,520
Scott: But like how much do I really care?

317
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,449
Rym: I guess why is that there?

318
00:18:38,991 --> 00:18:42,584
Scott: It's because it's basically that bar at the top is basically a Kinect.

319
00:18:42,805 --> 00:18:44,090
Scott: It's a Microsoft Kinect in there.

320
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:46,447
Rym: But why not just have the bar go all the way across the top?

321
00:18:47,374 --> 00:18:55,969
Scott: Instead of as you get that really useless screen You know because by pushing the time and the symbols out of the way now that you gain that much more space.

322
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,669
Rym: right True except for full-screen apps and I have to deal with it.

323
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:03,557
Scott: See that's the thing I don't understand is the full-screen apps like.

324
00:19:03,637 --> 00:19:07,390
Scott: why should the full-screen apps even be allowed to intrude into those little areas?

325
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:17,983
Scott: Those little ear areas should always contain the time and the symbols no matter what and they should only option should be to make it Black to hide them if you want like watching a video or something.

326
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:22,320
Scott: that is the correct answer Should only be able to go into the space below.

327
00:19:22,481 --> 00:19:24,830
Scott: Why should apps be able to creep into those two notches?

328
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:29,770
Scott: I guess you could if you wanted to make a cute app that does something up there like a game.

329
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,337
Scott: No, no, but then how's that?

330
00:19:31,377 --> 00:19:33,467
Scott: What's that app gonna do on a regular iPhone?

331
00:19:33,527 --> 00:19:34,070
Rym: Yeah, that's it.

332
00:19:34,171 --> 00:19:35,850
Rym: None of you were clever enough to use that thing.

333
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:38,630
Rym: Well what Scott suggested is the correct answer.

334
00:19:39,051 --> 00:19:41,842
Scott: But I guess if you're on the lock screen it can put like nice.

335
00:19:41,882 --> 00:19:43,067
Scott: your picture can extend up.

336
00:19:43,107 --> 00:19:43,910
Scott: there is kind of nice.

337
00:19:44,131 --> 00:19:46,099
Rym: That is dumb.

338
00:19:46,441 --> 00:20:00,855
Rym: why I mean just it's bet you know, oh, yeah Well, I guess the only things you should be able to use that area are the iPhones direct notification status bars itself Yeah, or apps that appear on the lock screen Probably controlled by Apple.

339
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:04,766
Scott: I mean just your lock screen literal your actual lock screen background up there.

340
00:20:04,846 --> 00:20:06,090
Scott: Yeah, right or whatever.

341
00:20:06,211 --> 00:20:07,099
Scott: But yeah, it's like hell.

342
00:20:07,401 --> 00:20:08,087
Rym: I know that aside.

343
00:20:08,591 --> 00:20:14,050
Rym: the other thing I'm gonna complain about is that people are kind of talking about the pricing in a rude way because it's $1,000.

344
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:14,713
Rym: No, no, no, it's not.

345
00:20:14,733 --> 00:20:16,077
Scott: It's like 11 or 12 hundred.

346
00:20:16,138 --> 00:20:24,850
Scott: It's a $1,000 for the 64 gigabyte worthless one that no one should buy because 64 gigs is not enough.

347
00:20:25,071 --> 00:20:28,601
Rym: I'm gonna quote this verge article because this article exemplifies what I'm talking about.

348
00:20:28,622 --> 00:20:29,424
Rym: I'm gonna read a sentence.

349
00:20:29,845 --> 00:20:53,007
Rym: It'll come in two storage configurations 64 gigabytes in other words never by for $999 and 256 gigabytes too much for a whopping One thousand one hundred forty nine dollars now 149 dollars as an incremental increase in price between 64 gigabytes and 256 gigabytes is not whopping.

350
00:20:53,449 --> 00:20:56,236
Rym: No $149 is default.

351
00:20:56,557 --> 00:21:00,650
Rym: You should not buy the small iPhone X at the same time.

352
00:21:01,392 --> 00:21:01,954
Scott: How much?

353
00:21:02,174 --> 00:21:02,576
Scott: what's it?

354
00:21:02,616 --> 00:21:06,026
Scott: What's a 256 gigabyte SD card go?

355
00:21:06,107 --> 00:21:07,110
Rym: I don't even care about that.

356
00:21:07,831 --> 00:21:14,090
Scott: Apple's always been that way as I'm saying, but that's the biggest deal as they still are way overcharging for the storage.

357
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:15,494
Rym: There should be my Android phone.

358
00:21:15,615 --> 00:21:18,865
Rym: I can stick that arbitrarily sized micro SD card in there.

359
00:21:18,925 --> 00:21:25,110
Scott: that larger size 256 gigs cost Apple basically nothing extra to make.

360
00:21:25,854 --> 00:21:26,497
Rym: You're missing the port.

361
00:21:26,537 --> 00:21:27,100
Rym: forget that one.

362
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,748
Rym: Apple's never gonna let you put your SD card in.

363
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:32,027
Scott: No, no No, I'm saying they should have a single configuration.

364
00:21:32,128 --> 00:21:36,521
Scott: No Or a thousand dollars, you know how I me.

365
00:21:36,621 --> 00:21:39,090
Rym: the designer freaks out about those pixels on the top.

366
00:21:39,653 --> 00:21:41,343
Rym: So here is why app.

367
00:21:41,705 --> 00:21:46,450
Rym: in my opinion Apple has the 64 gigabyte so they can advertise a lower price.

368
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:53,793
Rym: It exists solely so that their marketing media can say the iPhone X starts at 999 dollars.

369
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:58,590
Scott: why not make those smaller one 128 so that it's actually you can buy that one.

370
00:21:58,932 --> 00:22:13,593
Rym: It probably because if it was 128 256 I just buy the 128 because if they make it 64 gigabytes Then a much higher percentage of people will buy the bigger correct sized one for the extra hundred forty six is actually too Much.

371
00:22:13,634 --> 00:22:15,150
Scott: you don't need all this space Yeah.

372
00:22:15,451 --> 00:22:29,710
Rym: But I literally think they just made the 64 gigabyte one nine nine nine so that they can have a price point that is under $1,000 because muggles still don't understand what smartphones actually cost because of like a decade of phone price subsidies.

373
00:22:30,071 --> 00:22:34,750
Scott: I have the iPhone 7 and when I got the iPhone 7 I got the upgrade plan because I was hoping for iPhone 8.

374
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,438
Scott: That was a significant upgrade right now.

375
00:22:36,699 --> 00:22:42,662
Scott: Yeah, and I pay for the iPhone 7 $37 a month and that includes the best Apple care and everything.

376
00:22:42,722 --> 00:22:52,769
Scott: and now basically at any time starting now ish I can go and give them my iPhone and get a new one and pay the monthly fee for that and Do not have to pay 37 a month anymore, right?

377
00:22:53,931 --> 00:22:55,899
Scott: Pretty much all the iPhones worth getting.

378
00:22:56,441 --> 00:23:02,137
Scott: the old which is the iPhone X that's big Costs 50 something plus a month.

379
00:23:02,498 --> 00:23:06,650
Scott: Am I gonna pay $20 more every month to get that phone?

380
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:11,490
Scott: It's like that's to get those pixels up there to get some extra pixels and some better cameras.

381
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:14,319
Scott: It's like no for $20 more a month.

382
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,850
Scott: I could just go spend that on plenty of other good shit.

383
00:23:18,051 --> 00:23:20,622
Rym: Well, I wonder where Apple might be losing some momentum.

384
00:23:20,723 --> 00:23:21,707
Scott: and iPhone 8.

385
00:23:21,707 --> 00:23:26,663
Scott: It's like, okay I could go get the iPhone 8 but it's not better in any significant way.

386
00:23:26,703 --> 00:23:31,950
Scott: that matters to me compared to my iPhone 7 and And it will cost me more money.

387
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:32,893
Scott: so why would I do that?

388
00:23:32,993 --> 00:23:42,581
Rym: Apple is increasingly having trouble marketing iPhones like new versions that come out as Game-changing and revolutionary whereas Android there's no marketing around.

389
00:23:42,641 --> 00:23:48,510
Rym: this Android phone will fucking change your life with the keynote, but smartphones have hit sort of a plateau.

390
00:23:49,112 --> 00:23:57,055
Rym: Where there aren't new life-changing features that are capable of being added until battery technology or processor You could just stop overcharging.

391
00:23:57,095 --> 00:24:04,010
Scott: people put out that iPhone X at a lower profit margin and people will buy it like Insano and they'll kick all the Android phones asses.

392
00:24:04,271 --> 00:24:06,679
Scott: I don't know but Apple has never been concerned in doing that.

393
00:24:06,739 --> 00:24:11,760
Scott: like Ferrari could sell cars at a low profit margin and kick all The Ford's asses, but they don't do that either.

394
00:24:11,801 --> 00:24:12,626
Scott: It's a luxury brand.

395
00:24:12,646 --> 00:24:13,189
Scott: That's how they do.

396
00:24:13,631 --> 00:24:15,135
Rym: Yeah, but there's no.

397
00:24:15,256 --> 00:24:20,030
Rym: there's no way to market cutting-edge features when there's nothing new in the smartphone world.

398
00:24:20,473 --> 00:24:21,539
Scott: That screen is pretty new.

399
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,928
Rym: Yeah, but it's so.

400
00:24:22,968 --> 00:24:24,996
Rym: it's 2436 by 1125 but by how many inches?

401
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:29,313
Rym: 5.8.

402
00:24:29,313 --> 00:24:29,714
Scott: Yeah.

403
00:24:29,895 --> 00:24:30,296
Scott: All right.

404
00:24:30,617 --> 00:24:30,978
Scott: All right.

405
00:24:31,239 --> 00:24:32,663
Scott: That's right the best screen on earth.

406
00:24:32,824 --> 00:24:35,411
Rym: That's more pixels than this fucking monitor I'm looking.

407
00:24:35,431 --> 00:24:38,421
Scott: that is the best screen that a consumer can buy.

408
00:24:38,562 --> 00:24:42,715
Rym: that is more pixels than the Dell ultra sharp I'm literally looking at right.

409
00:24:42,735 --> 00:24:43,758
Scott: That's why it's $1,000.

410
00:24:43,758 --> 00:24:46,024
Scott: Yeah for the screen alone.

411
00:24:46,044 --> 00:24:48,411
Scott: I would pay but not $1,000.

412
00:24:48,411 --> 00:24:56,795
Rym: So in other news and again, we're gonna talk about this in more depth later, but just in case you didn't notice Equifax got hacked.

413
00:24:57,216 --> 00:24:59,344
Rym: and normally when someone got hacked

414
00:24:59,404 --> 00:25:00,930
Scott: and someone got their password guessed

415
00:25:01,155 --> 00:25:08,579
Rym: Well, no, no No, so when someone got hacked and database got released like company got hacked not individual and information got released Usually it's

416
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:10,794
Scott: SQL injection the

417
00:25:10,935 --> 00:25:19,010
Rym: salted rainbow table of rainbow the salted table of like password hashes Yeah and usernames, but this one's different.

418
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:31,302
Rym: So if you've been ignoring this hack, the reason it's different is that the data that was breached was ahem first names last names birthdays Social Security numbers Mm-hmm.

419
00:25:31,791 --> 00:25:36,750
Rym: That means you're fucked if your data got hacked and everyone's data is in there.

420
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:46,930
Scott: If you're a United States person with credit, yeah, these companies my data is I haven't even looked Didn't they release like a thing where you can show?

421
00:25:47,792 --> 00:26:05,790
Rym: So I am just I so according to the reporting on this issue because I'm we're not a primary source here The website they gave out where you could check to see if you got hacked Provides random results that vary based on what browser you use to submit the exact same information.

422
00:26:06,294 --> 00:26:08,590
Scott: Oh, really and even I didn't check.

423
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:11,057
Scott: I just assumed my stuff is in there because I read it.

424
00:26:11,218 --> 00:26:14,106
Rym: the click-through agreement if you check says you can't sue them.

425
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:20,750
Rym: Ah So they're just evil and this is real fucking bad.

426
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:32,721
Rym: I know the click-through agreement for not suing them was like if you pay for their credit No No, apparently the click-through agreement - if you use the site that would tell you if you were hacked you agree to not sue them Uh-huh.

427
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:40,312
Rym: And apparently that website just returned random results according to a whole bunch of reporters who put the same data into a bunch of different Places.

428
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:40,733
Rym: Mm-hmm.

429
00:26:41,155 --> 00:26:47,930
Rym: This is real bad because in the US your social security number I don't know if you I said for people to understand what Equifax is, right?

430
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:54,515
Scott: There are these companies called credit bureaus and there's a law the fair credit reporting act that determines how these companies work And there's only four.

431
00:26:54,555 --> 00:26:56,062
Scott: but I learned today five of them.

432
00:26:56,143 --> 00:26:57,228
Scott: Apparently there's a fifth one.

433
00:26:57,268 --> 00:26:57,690
Scott: That's weird.

434
00:26:57,911 --> 00:26:59,661
Scott: Yeah, fourth one is actually also weird.

435
00:26:59,923 --> 00:27:01,130
Scott: The other three are less weird.

436
00:27:01,271 --> 00:27:08,580
Scott: The not weird ones are Equifax the bad one Experian and TransUnion, those are the real ones.

437
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,986
Scott: The fourth one is in Novus.

438
00:27:10,006 --> 00:27:10,930
Scott: That's slightly weird.

439
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:16,394
Scott: And then the fifth one I learned about just today when I was reading about this is PCR be I think or something.

440
00:27:16,454 --> 00:27:17,316
Scott: we don't worried about that.

441
00:27:17,356 --> 00:27:26,042
Scott: But what these companies do is You're they report or companies report to them Incidences that are related to people's credits like this.

442
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:28,070
Rym: bum didn't pay this credit card, right?

443
00:27:28,231 --> 00:27:33,493
Scott: For example, the only time I had a negative report is when the hospital in Rochester Right.

444
00:27:33,574 --> 00:27:34,177
Rym: I remember that.

445
00:27:34,197 --> 00:27:36,270
Rym: I remember you bitching about that for like six years.

446
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:38,075
Scott: So I didn't pay them.

447
00:27:38,236 --> 00:27:49,190
Scott: and if you checked if you get did a credit report on Scott Rubin to see if Scott Rubin is Someone you should loan money to and it would say yeah He's always pays every bill except for this one to this hospital.

448
00:27:49,291 --> 00:27:51,629
Scott: But now that's gone because there's a time limit on those things.

449
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:51,775
Scott: Yep.

450
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:56,869
Scott: So now if you look up on the credit bureau or any of them and say should I lend money to Scott Rubin.

451
00:27:56,909 --> 00:27:57,110
Scott: is he?

452
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:59,322
Scott: Someone who will pay his bills and pay back this loan.

453
00:27:59,362 --> 00:28:00,608
Scott: It says absolutely.

454
00:28:00,649 --> 00:28:02,696
Scott: Yes God is a person who has money.

455
00:28:02,876 --> 00:28:05,003
Rym: these companies really is basically scores.

456
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:07,170
Rym: Like how good are you at money, right?

457
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:12,850
Scott: So they're what their information can significantly impact lives of every United States citizen.

458
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:19,408
Rym: So here's an example if you want to buy a car They check that and if your number is too low They give you a higher interest rate or they won't sell you a car.

459
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:27,107
Scott: You could try to get a job and because of information at Okofax Someone might decide not to hire you because of what these data that these come.

460
00:28:27,127 --> 00:28:27,670
Rym: that is legal.

461
00:28:28,091 --> 00:28:29,856
Rym: It is totally you you can require.

462
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:30,619
Rym: try to get you.

463
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:38,170
Scott: try to rent an apartment and the person renting you the apartment will ask These companies if that's a good idea and if they say no the person won't rent you the apartment.

464
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:46,075
Scott: yep, your lives are if you're in the United States are extremely extremely impacted by these companies and Bottom and the top.

465
00:28:46,095 --> 00:28:50,781
Rym: so if you have a low credit scar, you can't get the job You need to pay off your bills.

466
00:28:51,002 --> 00:28:52,410
Rym: Yeah, and you can't get a cheap apartment.

467
00:28:52,812 --> 00:28:55,765
Rym: And if you need to buy a car because in America you need to own a car.

468
00:28:55,785 --> 00:29:00,350
Rym: unless you live in New York City You're gonna have to buy a car from a garbage place.

469
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:04,110
Rym: That's gonna rip you off and charge a lot for a shitty car and give you high interest rate.

470
00:29:04,351 --> 00:29:08,890
Rym: But on the other side if you have perfect credit you get lower interest on everything.

471
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:17,103
Scott: Yeah Anyway, these companies because they provide this service according to the Fair Credit Reporting Act law Whatever have everyone's fucking data.

472
00:29:17,223 --> 00:29:18,390
Scott: who has money in this country?

473
00:29:18,722 --> 00:29:19,573
Scott: Yeah They just have everyone's.

474
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:23,389
Scott: it's like it might as well be a government database times four of them or five of them.

475
00:29:23,973 --> 00:29:30,569
Scott: tons of info out there at these companies and Equifax's IT was apparently garbage and all that got leaked.

476
00:29:31,152 --> 00:29:35,105
Scott: Someone just took down took their database all the infos from there about all the US citizens.

477
00:29:35,145 --> 00:29:36,550
Scott: now that would all their monies.

478
00:29:37,051 --> 00:29:47,445
Rym: But it's worse because the data that was leaked first name last name social security number birth date That's enough plus more for oh, yeah plus a lot more.

479
00:29:47,927 --> 00:29:51,663
Rym: and also if you Paid for services with Equifax.

480
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:52,749
Scott: They got even more monies.

481
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:53,572
Rym: Well, they also.

482
00:29:53,913 --> 00:29:56,883
Rym: some of the data is for two hundred nine thousand US people.

483
00:29:57,444 --> 00:29:59,070
Rym: They actually got credit card numbers.

484
00:29:59,511 --> 00:30:01,057
Scott: No, I did a. I got.

485
00:30:01,418 --> 00:30:02,843
Scott: I did my free credit report one.

486
00:30:02,944 --> 00:30:04,650
Rym: I did my credits like almost seven hundred.

487
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:06,136
Scott: Yeah, these companies you have likes.

488
00:30:06,156 --> 00:30:09,490
Scott: you have to pay these companies money for them to tell you information about.

489
00:30:10,294 --> 00:30:13,169
Rym: You can get one a year for once a year for free.

490
00:30:13,392 --> 00:30:16,877
Scott: They have to tell you What your credit score is and what.

491
00:30:16,978 --> 00:30:19,547
Scott: but more than once a year you have to pay if you want.

492
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:21,294
Scott: you're in to see if Anything happened to.

493
00:30:21,374 --> 00:30:28,210
Rym: actually I still have that old capital one credit card the one I got when I was in high school Mm-hmm, and they started giving me a free credit report like every month.

494
00:30:28,371 --> 00:30:30,250
Scott: Oh, yeah, Chase Bank gives me a free credit report.

495
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:32,666
Scott: Yeah, she saw there's other service, but I don't.

496
00:30:32,686 --> 00:30:33,270
Scott: I haven't used it.

497
00:30:33,752 --> 00:30:35,299
Rym: I used them all to see my credit is real good.

498
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:35,942
Rym: Apparently Mike.

499
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:36,706
Scott: I did it once.

500
00:30:36,766 --> 00:30:37,510
Scott: my credit was fine.

501
00:30:37,592 --> 00:30:38,549
Scott: Nothing's happened since then.

502
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:43,010
Rym: My credit is apparently better than someone my age should have only because I got my first credit card.

503
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:43,674
Rym: I was 16.

504
00:30:43,674 --> 00:30:45,103
Scott: point is someone can go and take this.

505
00:30:45,123 --> 00:30:47,858
Scott: if someone has this data Which they can just go get a home loan.

506
00:30:47,938 --> 00:30:50,510
Scott: They can go get a loan and buy a house in my name.

507
00:30:51,533 --> 00:30:53,360
Scott: I have to find out if they did somehow.

508
00:30:53,421 --> 00:30:54,324
Scott: How would I know if they did?

509
00:30:54,625 --> 00:30:54,886
Rym: Yep.

510
00:30:55,468 --> 00:30:57,958
Rym: So This is real bad.

511
00:30:58,078 --> 00:31:01,110
Scott: Someone out there claims to be Scott Reuben buys a house has a mortgage.

512
00:31:01,251 --> 00:31:03,729
Scott: It's written down that the Scott Reubens mortgage or living in the house.

513
00:31:04,372 --> 00:31:05,074
Scott: They don't pay it.

514
00:31:05,436 --> 00:31:09,370
Scott: then someone knocks on my door and it's like hey, how can we not paying your mortgage?

515
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:10,253
Scott: I'm like what mortgage?

516
00:31:10,675 --> 00:31:11,780
Rym: so what?

517
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:20,990
Rym: one of the things that I'm an expert in is Like sock and I all that ISO nonsense around like how do you do good IT security practices?

518
00:31:21,473 --> 00:31:23,990
Rym: And how do you document that you do them?

519
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:28,310
Rym: And how do you prove to other people and how do you report if you're an entity that has to report on that?

520
00:31:28,752 --> 00:31:30,341
Rym: Like what you're doing for security.

521
00:31:30,361 --> 00:31:37,050
Rym: I Feel like the fact that this breach happens means that a lot of that was not happening at this company.

522
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:40,201
Rym: Nope, and the fact that this company has such critical like.

523
00:31:40,221 --> 00:31:42,028
Rym: there's a concept a PII.

524
00:31:42,329 --> 00:31:46,086
Rym: I think it's Personally identifiable or identifying information.

525
00:31:46,106 --> 00:31:46,287
Rym: Mm-hmm.

526
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:53,090
Rym: That kind of data is so much more dangerous and so much more highly regulated than other kinds of data.

527
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,910
Scott: We don't even store credit card numbers at work.

528
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:59,010
Scott: We just if you try to buy something from us, we use the credit card number take your money and then that's it.

529
00:31:59,272 --> 00:32:00,790
Scott: Oh, yeah, we don't let you save it or anything.

530
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:05,164
Rym: You can avoid storing PII in a system that you control.

531
00:32:05,485 --> 00:32:06,910
Rym: it saves you a lot of headaches.

532
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:07,635
Scott: That's what we do.

533
00:32:08,199 --> 00:32:11,656
Rym: but a company like this Failing so horribly.

534
00:32:11,676 --> 00:32:23,530
Rym: This is a sector that probably needs really heavy-handed regulation Mm-hmm, which is not happening And as far as I can so I looked up to see what the happening at the other three or four major places.

535
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:28,150
Scott: Yeah, we learned some one of them was running PR to like say how they're not awful.

536
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:29,996
Scott: Another one was like oh shit.

537
00:32:30,016 --> 00:32:32,784
Scott: We're gonna be worried like doomsday right?

538
00:32:32,865 --> 00:32:38,760
Scott: and the other one was like we're the weird one We're the discoverer of credit reporting.

539
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:47,130
Scott: Yeah, who knows what's up with that anyway, but Yeah, I wonder because what I heard from eco facts the little that I heard was that their IT was so garbage.

540
00:32:47,251 --> 00:33:01,150
Scott: They were running like Windows Server 2003 and like the person in charge of their IT was not someone who came from an IT background which on the one hand is Perfectly fine because you know my first boss had a philosophy degree.

541
00:33:01,411 --> 00:33:04,741
Scott: Well, my first boss after college my current boss is a journalism degree.

542
00:33:04,761 --> 00:33:10,441
Scott: It's like you don't need to have you know Education in IT to work in the IT industry.

543
00:33:10,542 --> 00:33:12,810
Rym: CTO doesn't mean you make all the technology decisions.

544
00:33:13,231 --> 00:33:17,144
Rym: It means that you're the one responsible for those decisions being made right.

545
00:33:17,164 --> 00:33:19,130
Rym: a subtle difference between those two statements.

546
00:33:19,631 --> 00:33:26,230
Scott: But it still does appear that their IT setup was generally a shit show that had not been updated.

547
00:33:27,391 --> 00:33:29,883
Scott: That kind of old busted Windows thing.

548
00:33:29,923 --> 00:33:35,264
Scott: you can imagine, you know One of those companies that people still have IE 6 kind of deal But that was not the source of the breach.

549
00:33:35,284 --> 00:33:41,550
Rym: according to them The source of the breach was a flaw in Apache struts, which one doesn't matter if you use someone else's software.

550
00:33:41,952 --> 00:33:42,334
Rym: They're not.

551
00:33:42,515 --> 00:33:48,350
Rym: if you use someone else's software, especially open source software They are not responsible for your security.

552
00:33:48,731 --> 00:33:51,158
Rym: You are responsible for verifying their security.

553
00:33:51,198 --> 00:33:55,290
Scott: shows that the people working there were not people who were good at security.

554
00:33:56,033 --> 00:34:02,970
Rym: Also on top of all that Apparently some executives that krafax sold a bunch of stock right before they announced that they'd been hacked.

555
00:34:03,071 --> 00:34:05,564
Scott: So, how did they know that they had been hacked?

556
00:34:05,604 --> 00:34:06,689
Scott: if they're so incompetent IT?

557
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:09,630
Scott: They must have know had some confidence to know that this had happened.

558
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:15,612
Scott: maybe someone sent them a ransom note or so or maybe they found out that they were hacked and How would?

559
00:34:15,672 --> 00:34:16,614
Scott: how did they even find out?

560
00:34:17,318 --> 00:34:18,100
Rym: Uh, there's a lot.

561
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:23,695
Rym: so usually what'll happen is someone will notice something hinky But That's a new word.

562
00:34:23,735 --> 00:34:24,338
Rym: I like that word.

563
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,646
Rym: It's one of my favorite words lately.

564
00:34:25,686 --> 00:34:26,330
Rym: that implausible.

565
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,717
Rym: But something hinky is going on.

566
00:34:28,958 --> 00:34:34,239
Rym: but like some ops person notices something hinky Like that's a weird DNS request.

567
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,705
Rym: like they're looking through some logs.

568
00:34:36,025 --> 00:34:38,090
Rym: So they open a ticket like hey Let's look into this later.

569
00:34:38,511 --> 00:34:45,099
Rym: And then eventually it gets just like my desk if I worked for a company that does the kinds of stuff and I look at And go wait a minute.

570
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:46,649
Rym: That's there's something up there.

571
00:34:46,992 --> 00:34:53,822
Rym: I'm gonna open a bunch of our tickets to look into this hinky business And then eventually a report goes up the CTO saying something fucking hinky happened.

572
00:34:54,103 --> 00:34:56,130
Scott: Yeah, but you sell your own stock.

573
00:34:56,431 --> 00:34:57,414
Scott: Yeah, I wish I should.

574
00:34:57,554 --> 00:35:02,950
Scott: I wish I could set up a bot that automatically detects when an insider is selling and then also sell.

575
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:05,016
Scott: Yes, it just insider activity.

576
00:35:05,057 --> 00:35:07,344
Rym: Like if it's got people do that all the time.

577
00:35:07,404 --> 00:35:09,290
Rym: That's that's a common trading strategy.

578
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:10,013
Scott: How do I do that?

579
00:35:10,114 --> 00:35:12,424
Scott: Because you know, how can Scott Rubin do that?

580
00:35:12,706 --> 00:35:16,845
Rym: Uh, pretty easily I mean so usually and again, I'm not giving financial advice.

581
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:22,761
Rym: Mm-hmm, but Insider holdings are Regulated or controlled to some degree.

582
00:35:22,781 --> 00:35:32,385
Rym: so like if someone who works for a big company Wants to sell a bunch of stock in the company they work for I have to say so Yeah, they make an announce So you'll see things like scheduled like some executives will schedule.

583
00:35:32,425 --> 00:35:40,829
Rym: like every month I am selling this number of shares on this day Mm-hmm, because they you know, they want that to be taken into account by everyone else.

584
00:35:41,413 --> 00:35:44,289
Rym: But apparently these Agra facts executives just fucking sold stock.

585
00:35:45,411 --> 00:35:51,550
Rym: And then like right before this happened and according to the news I'm reading they're now the focus of a criminal investigation.

586
00:35:51,657 --> 00:36:08,453
Scott: Yes You are not allowed to do the insider trading good or bad And unless you're a congressperson in the United States in which case you can do that all you want Because you just you know that a certain law is gonna happen It's gonna affect an industry and you just buy or sell stock in that industry then we could do a job dick about it, but uh Not.

587
00:36:08,473 --> 00:36:11,739
Scott: if you're someone who works at a company so Jail time for you.

588
00:36:11,759 --> 00:36:13,008
Rym: So here's the two takeaways.

589
00:36:13,249 --> 00:36:24,540
Rym: one If you are in any way responsible for information about people in a commercial setting Like, you know all the citizens of the United States.

590
00:36:24,881 --> 00:36:30,784
Rym: you should understand something about Secure our system and organization controls.

591
00:36:30,844 --> 00:36:32,170
Rym: I never remember what sock stands.

592
00:36:32,331 --> 00:36:36,487
Scott: Also other countries because I pretty sure these credit bureaus only apply to the United States.

593
00:36:36,828 --> 00:36:40,161
Scott: other countries Please tell me how credit reporting is handled there.

594
00:36:40,402 --> 00:36:44,137
Scott: Like if you need a loan and say France How do they find out if you're good for it or not?

595
00:36:44,358 --> 00:36:45,764
Rym: Yeah, probably way better.

596
00:36:45,804 --> 00:36:49,984
Scott: word of mouth like hey Oh, oh those does really have the money.

597
00:36:50,185 --> 00:36:51,090
Rym: Well, see there's so many problems.

598
00:36:51,271 --> 00:36:55,424
Rym: The problem really is that the information that was leaked should not be that dangerous.

599
00:36:55,444 --> 00:37:02,050
Rym: the fact that a few numbers Like a social security number is that dangerous to be leaked in the US is the real problem.

600
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:08,747
Scott: I'm hoping it's one of those situations where the fact that it's fine You know, you had to wait for the egg to be cracked before people do something about it.

601
00:37:08,807 --> 00:37:18,431
Rym: So but I Companies or people who have this sort of information need to do real due diligence on security and Like.

602
00:37:19,034 --> 00:37:22,310
Rym: it's not an easy thing and it's gonna be a lot of work and cost you a lot of money.

603
00:37:22,391 --> 00:37:26,078
Rym: But you need to be doing it because if you're not doing it You're gonna get fucked by something like this.

604
00:37:26,379 --> 00:37:41,585
Rym: But my second takeaway is that if This situation is that bad and so much information is leaked that identity theft becomes endemic then credit scores Start to mean bupkis because they're filled with fake data and garbage.

605
00:37:41,646 --> 00:37:45,410
Scott: credit scores are already Often filled with fake data and garbage.

606
00:37:45,671 --> 00:37:51,870
Rym: So if you have bad credit and actually and the credit that the whole system gets undermined by this you come out.

607
00:37:51,994 --> 00:37:52,308
Rym: Okay.

608
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:59,546
Scott: Well, if you believe that then maybe you believe in that fifth weirdo credit bureau, which relies on self-reported data.

609
00:37:59,566 --> 00:38:04,244
Rym: Ah Hey, I totally paid that bill that one time to that guy.

610
00:38:04,264 --> 00:38:06,517
Scott: Well, I think you have to prove your Reports, right?

611
00:38:06,538 --> 00:38:07,930
Scott: You can't just type in anything you want.

612
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:13,674
Scott: You prove like your history of paying for stuff and then that's that's what's used for, you know How good you are.

613
00:38:13,715 --> 00:38:15,042
Rym: so really briefly the last news.

614
00:38:15,062 --> 00:38:25,080
Rym: Let's talk about because this is like Real technology news which we always can pull a scout always complains Seal or approval real tech news.

615
00:38:25,141 --> 00:38:26,045
Rym: this just happened.

616
00:38:26,125 --> 00:38:29,373
Rym: So like Dateline 702 p.m.

617
00:38:29,453 --> 00:38:30,999
Scott: Eastern talking about it for years.

618
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,547
Rym: Yeah, but it actually happened.

619
00:38:33,587 --> 00:38:34,270
Scott: It happened is done.

620
00:38:34,591 --> 00:38:38,050
Rym: So the World Wide Web Consortium, these are the band in the consensus.

621
00:38:38,411 --> 00:38:43,545
Scott: These are the people who determine the formats for like HTML CSS?

622
00:38:43,645 --> 00:38:45,490
Scott: what's gonna be in browsers HTTP?

623
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:48,139
Scott: All you know because the web is like the number one thing you use.

624
00:38:48,641 --> 00:38:49,143
Scott: and they did.

625
00:38:49,204 --> 00:38:50,710
Scott: they decide all the standards.

626
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:54,230
Scott: So basically it's representatives through a bunch of companies and interest groups.

627
00:38:54,491 --> 00:38:57,501
Scott: They all meet and they all collaborate and decide.

628
00:38:57,882 --> 00:38:59,407
Scott: are we gonna remove the blink tag?

629
00:38:59,487 --> 00:39:00,410
Scott: All right, we're removing it.

630
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:02,018
Scott: All right, CSS is gonna work like this.

631
00:39:02,078 --> 00:39:04,310
Scott: All right, that's how it's gonna work and they all work together.

632
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:10,970
Scott: So as far as I know all the Apple Microsoft, you know Mozilla, it's like, you know, everybody's in on this.

633
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:16,830
Rym: But as far as I know this stuff the consortium has almost always been done by major consensus.

634
00:39:16,931 --> 00:39:25,790
Rym: Yes that they wait for everyone to agree on Like the majority of what they're talking about has their rules for proceedings and voting and appeals.

635
00:39:25,971 --> 00:39:34,359
Scott: But generally the way it works is they all compromise and work and compromise and work together until they decide Alright, that's what the standards gonna be.

636
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,989
Scott: everyone agrees on it and then they all vote.

637
00:39:37,029 --> 00:39:38,815
Scott: Yay And now I am anyone's voting.

638
00:39:38,875 --> 00:39:40,681
Scott: nay, they change it a little bit.

639
00:39:40,761 --> 00:39:43,430
Rym: I am a fan of administration by consensus.

640
00:39:43,551 --> 00:39:45,746
Rym: We run the RIT Anime Club that way the executive board.

641
00:39:45,766 --> 00:39:46,250
Scott: How do you think?

642
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:47,842
Scott: Did you think you could run a country that way?

643
00:39:47,862 --> 00:39:54,410
Rym: Uh Maybe not a country but I'm talking about like the like local administration like running a body of some kind.

644
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:55,293
Scott: Yeah, if any because.

645
00:39:55,313 --> 00:40:00,190
Scott: yeah, especially well because you have a small body right you have a small number of representatives in that body.

646
00:40:00,837 --> 00:40:11,672
Scott: It's like if you can't you know each one of those representatives represents a Significant percentage like if you have a hundred people with five representatives if one of them is going and I think you need a consensus Right.

647
00:40:11,732 --> 00:40:15,029
Scott: It's like you're having 20% of your people's happy, right?

648
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:17,239
Rym: But this is apparently.

649
00:40:17,279 --> 00:40:19,109
Rym: this might be the first time they have ever abandoned.

650
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:24,330
Scott: This is the first time there was an appeal ever that's for sure and it might be the first time they abandoned consensus.

651
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:27,580
Scott: 50 what 58 percent agreed to this.

652
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:30,148
Rym: Yeah, fifty eight point four percent agreed with this.

653
00:40:30,349 --> 00:40:33,280
Rym: Mm-hmm It was appealed which has never happened before.

654
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,425
Scott: 42 percent of the web.

655
00:40:36,411 --> 00:40:40,505
Scott: People who have to deal with the web do not want this to happen, but it's gonna happen.

656
00:40:40,526 --> 00:40:46,210
Rym: The appeal was denied Mm-hmm, and the EFF said fuck you and resigned from the organization, right?

657
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:49,823
Scott: So the EFF is no longer involved in w3c as of today.

658
00:40:49,863 --> 00:40:51,610
Scott: They might rejoin but unlikely.

659
00:40:51,971 --> 00:40:53,254
Rym: So, what is this all about?

660
00:40:53,654 --> 00:40:59,146
Rym: It's whether or not to have a standard way to do DRM on the world wide web.

661
00:40:59,427 --> 00:40:59,627
Scott: Mm-hmm.

662
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:03,480
Rym: I It is a complicated problem because on what he

663
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:06,090
Scott: talked about this on GeekNights before when it was first proposed

664
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:16,470
Rym: Yeah on one hand if you don't standardize it then Private companies might put their own standards and we might get back into plug-in hell to view proprietary media.

665
00:41:17,332 --> 00:41:24,730
Scott: On the other hand, it's basically people want to be able to watch like beautiful amazing 4k Netflix in the browser.

666
00:41:25,212 --> 00:41:29,829
Scott: But Netflix, you know and the people giving content to Netflix and what and etc.

667
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:36,569
Scott: We don't want to allow that because if it's through the browser Well, it could you know, you could just pirate all that shit and rip it.

668
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:42,789
Scott: So because the browser is like this piece of software the users controlling so they want some kind of DRM in there to prevent that.

669
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:46,349
Scott: Otherwise, they're just gonna force everyone to use like Netflix app and stuff.

670
00:41:47,581 --> 00:41:49,063
Rym: But on the other hand which has the DRM?

671
00:41:49,143 --> 00:41:53,229
Rym: anyway, if you allow it to be a standard that's a formal part of the WWW.

672
00:41:54,211 --> 00:42:07,088
Rym: that sort of like they cut the concept of DRM at its fundamental core is like directly Contradictory to the goals of the world wide web as stated when it was created.

673
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:13,410
Rym: Mm-hmm The idea is that information should always be you have a certain shareable sortable linkable.

674
00:42:13,551 --> 00:42:14,655
Scott: Yeah, you have a server.

675
00:42:14,716 --> 00:42:15,238
Scott: someone sends.

676
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:16,624
Scott: get with a URI.

677
00:42:16,664 --> 00:42:18,050
Scott: you're supposed to send them that thing.

678
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:20,884
Scott: You're not supposed to be like, alright, here's that encrypted thing.

679
00:42:21,286 --> 00:42:21,970
Scott: Did you pay money?

680
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:24,557
Rym: So I am heavily like.

681
00:42:24,717 --> 00:42:28,110
Rym: I'm even fairly ambivalent on the between ideology and pragmatism.

682
00:42:28,752 --> 00:42:31,159
Rym: But in the end, I sort of feel like the fuck you to.

683
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:33,867
Rym: DRM is more important than the standardization right now.

684
00:42:33,887 --> 00:42:38,530
Scott: Mm-hmm Like, you know DRM was like is on the downswing, right?

685
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:42,990
Scott: It's like all the DRM on PC games are getting busted and you know, making people unhappy.

686
00:42:43,612 --> 00:42:49,250
Scott: You know DRMs and other things, you know app I all the music services like iTunes doesn't have DRM anymore.

687
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:52,906
Scott: You just download mp3s or ACs in that case, right and they just play.

688
00:42:52,946 --> 00:42:53,670
Scott: they're just file.

689
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:59,732
Scott: Yeah, right DRM was taking a beating, you know We don't need to see DRM make a comeback and the very least I also don't.

690
00:42:59,813 --> 00:43:08,925
Rym: I don't really want to dilute the like the magic of what the world wide web was Even though we've sort of gone very far from what the world wide web originally was.

691
00:43:09,166 --> 00:43:17,466
Rym: those core guiding philosophies I think are still important and I'm actually very proud that the EFF was willing to walk away from this organization.

692
00:43:17,506 --> 00:43:18,429
Scott: Well, it doesn't help.

693
00:43:18,469 --> 00:43:25,190
Scott: the EFF's representative at the w3c is actually number one anti DRM.

694
00:43:25,551 --> 00:43:29,964
Scott: Well number two anti DRM person after Richard Stallman Corey doctor.

695
00:43:30,766 --> 00:43:41,108
Rym: Oh, so but this is this undermines the authority of the w3c to a degree Because the w3c's authority came primarily from the fact that everybody agreed.

696
00:43:41,148 --> 00:43:41,590
Rym: in the end.

697
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:51,966
Scott: There's still a lot of questions as to whether like for example Mozilla will implement right and such and such Yeah Or whether like will the Firefox fork on Linux the ice weasel?

698
00:43:52,127 --> 00:43:54,569
Rym: if that's still how they do We don't know what's gonna happen.

699
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:57,540
Rym: Yes, result of all there are some browsers gonna break from.

700
00:43:57,561 --> 00:44:00,049
Scott: the standard is like what's gonna happen here, right?

701
00:44:00,049 --> 00:44:04,020
Scott: 42% of web things gonna not work right.

702
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:04,722
Scott: a movie.

703
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:07,350
Rym: This is the moment of drama.

704
00:44:07,792 --> 00:44:17,865
Rym: We're like the representative of one of the countries in the UN in a movie Like slams their fist on the table and walks away and abandons the UN.

705
00:44:17,986 --> 00:44:18,226
Scott: Yep.

706
00:44:18,487 --> 00:44:19,410
Rym: So what happens next?

707
00:44:20,732 --> 00:44:21,508
Rym: Nobody knows.

708
00:44:27,382 --> 00:44:29,550
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

709
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:32,480
Rym: so real quick, you know, I'm a big fan of roller coasters and Cedar Point.

710
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:48,240
Rym: So I found this video while I was looking for another video and it's basically a roller coaster nerd talking about Most of the roller coasters that Existed at Cedar Point over the last hundred years that no longer exist and talks about like what their deal was.

711
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:50,132
Scott: Are there any that you haven't been on mr.

712
00:44:50,172 --> 00:44:51,300
Scott: Cedar Point fanboy?

713
00:44:52,121 --> 00:44:53,284
Rym: Yes, many of them.

714
00:44:53,345 --> 00:44:59,022
Rym: so I haven't been on this one that was built in 1908 and shut down in 1917.

715
00:44:59,022 --> 00:45:01,203
Rym: Okay, I'm sure okay From 1929 they tore it down in 1951.

716
00:45:01,203 --> 00:45:01,806
Rym: I did not ride that one.

717
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:12,969
Rym: Okay, but I have ridden Oh jumbo jet which my parents have ridden on Oh, but it was shut down in 78.

718
00:45:12,969 --> 00:45:14,474
Rym: So I was not ridden on it.

719
00:45:14,735 --> 00:45:25,476
Rym: Okay, but Several of these I have ridden on like avalanche run Disaster transport the Wildcat the second while disaster transport is a way cool name.

720
00:45:25,797 --> 00:45:26,800
Rym: It was a pretty cool coaster.

721
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:27,564
Scott: It's taken down.

722
00:45:27,986 --> 00:45:28,468
Rym: I'd taken.

723
00:45:28,508 --> 00:45:30,900
Rym: so here's I'll tell you the story of this one cuz it's real short.

724
00:45:31,201 --> 00:45:33,631
Rym: There was a roller coaster that was part roller.

725
00:45:33,671 --> 00:45:35,819
Scott: I just like the name good name part flume.

726
00:45:36,161 --> 00:45:38,590
Rym: So the roller coaster was I love me a flume.

727
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:41,020
Rym: It was on a rail, but not water flume just flume without water.

728
00:45:41,322 --> 00:45:49,076
Rym: Oh, so basically it was on rails But then it would go off the rails into like a halfpipe and then go back onto rails.

729
00:45:49,597 --> 00:45:50,299
Rym: It was really cool.

730
00:45:50,962 --> 00:45:53,454
Scott: If it was a water flume, that would be my favorite ride ever.

731
00:45:53,715 --> 00:45:54,860
Rym: So they got rid of that.

732
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:55,823
Rym: There was a water flume.

733
00:45:55,843 --> 00:45:56,626
Rym: There was very similar.

734
00:45:56,666 --> 00:45:58,211
Scott: There's a roller coaster.

735
00:45:58,271 --> 00:46:08,200
Scott: That's a log shape and then at the end The tracks and then it goes blue White water line And then they sort of fish the logs back onto the track.

736
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:11,360
Rym: There was the log ride and white water landing which was also a flume.

737
00:46:11,701 --> 00:46:15,200
Scott: Usually when you do a flume, it's just up and then sploosh.

738
00:46:16,662 --> 00:46:17,768
Rym: There was one like that.

739
00:46:17,808 --> 00:46:19,920
Rym: I think it was called white water landing, but they tore it down.

740
00:46:20,503 --> 00:46:21,146
Rym: I wrote it a lot.

741
00:46:21,186 --> 00:46:22,472
Scott: But anyway, I'm all about the flume.

742
00:46:22,793 --> 00:46:33,290
Rym: they shut down avalanche run But instead of tearing down the coaster They built a building around the entire coaster and they turned it into disaster transport Which was basically a better space mountain.

743
00:46:34,134 --> 00:46:38,010
Rym: Like legit better space mountain And then they tore that down.

744
00:46:38,231 --> 00:46:40,640
Scott: I mean the best part of space mountain is the space and not the mountain.

745
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:42,318
Scott: Yeah, everyone knows that.

746
00:46:42,962 --> 00:46:56,544
Rym: but yeah, this video is just like a real nerd history and the real crazy takeaway from this video is that There is not a lot of documentation of things like have these roller coasters like one of them that Existed for like 20 years.

747
00:46:56,825 --> 00:46:57,487
Rym: the guys like.

748
00:46:57,908 --> 00:47:03,206
Rym: this is the only known photo of this coaster in the world and nobody Actually knows who built it.

749
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:07,020
Scott: Yeah, no one was caring or keeping track of these sorts of things like they were historic.

750
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:09,007
Scott: It was just like some carny amusement park.

751
00:47:09,047 --> 00:47:12,239
Scott: Yeah, so just kind of think of it as like an important thing to you know.

752
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:13,644
Rym: Yeah, I'll leave the dips.

753
00:47:13,845 --> 00:47:14,969
Rym: So anyway, this video is pretty good.

754
00:47:15,611 --> 00:47:18,000
Scott: Okay, so I got two sort of two things of the day.

755
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,827
Rym: So I'm taking a play from the Rym handbook.

756
00:47:19,847 --> 00:47:21,935
Scott: Not really the sort of related.

757
00:47:22,277 --> 00:47:23,160
Scott: I'm gonna make them related.

758
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:31,270
Scott: So I found out today that you can buy on Amazon for like 40 bucks Endoscopes, I don't know if they're safe to shut up.

759
00:47:31,551 --> 00:47:33,900
Rym: You better not be announcing your new twitch channel.

760
00:47:34,202 --> 00:47:37,800
Scott: I don't know if you can shove these up your ass or down your throat safely.

761
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:40,428
Rym: You've just got you definitely can.

762
00:47:40,488 --> 00:47:42,173
Rym: the question is not can but should?

763
00:47:42,193 --> 00:47:45,423
Scott: I don't know if these are medical endoscopes But the point is they're.

764
00:47:45,544 --> 00:47:50,200
Scott: they're law their cameras at the end of long thin snakey devices, right?

765
00:47:50,782 --> 00:47:53,349
Scott: And they come in both wireless and wired.

766
00:47:53,409 --> 00:47:57,120
Scott: so you could like connect onto your phone and like see what the camera sees.

767
00:47:57,381 --> 00:47:59,612
Scott: We're just holding your phone and the USB ones.

768
00:47:59,653 --> 00:48:01,060
Scott: I assume just work like webcams.

769
00:48:01,382 --> 00:48:04,358
Rym: So I think we don't want to watch Scott's livestream if it suddenly starts.

770
00:48:04,398 --> 00:48:04,740
Rym: three, right?

771
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:10,640
Scott: So first of all, is it is would you watch you know endoscope videos on YouTube?

772
00:48:13,245 --> 00:48:18,366
Scott: Right, so I figure even if you're not using this for YouTube purposes, okay I cooked on one of these.

773
00:48:18,667 --> 00:48:22,240
Rym: most of the pictures are like I'm trying to fix my air conditioner.

774
00:48:22,461 --> 00:48:25,215
Rym: I shove it up there to see what's going on inside exactly.

775
00:48:25,295 --> 00:48:26,280
Scott: How useful is this thing?

776
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:28,611
Scott: You can look under the couch without getting your head on the floor.

777
00:48:28,872 --> 00:48:30,360
Scott: You can look behind the stove.

778
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:31,504
Scott: You can look dude.

779
00:48:31,544 --> 00:48:32,809
Scott: This one has accessories.

780
00:48:33,009 --> 00:48:35,960
Rym: It has a hook extension a magnet extension.

781
00:48:36,181 --> 00:48:39,457
Scott: Yeah, you can look in your throat when you're sick to see if there's anything in there, right?

782
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:45,460
Scott: You can look at your asshole not I'm not in it but like at it without using like five mirrors.

783
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:49,272
Rym: Right, it only takes me two mirrors tops.

784
00:48:49,352 --> 00:48:49,854
Scott: It's still two.

785
00:48:49,874 --> 00:48:51,660
Scott: It's still more than zero mirrors, right?

786
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:52,041
Scott: It's like.

787
00:48:52,322 --> 00:48:55,133
Scott: this is just a really really really useful thing to have.

788
00:48:55,354 --> 00:49:01,640
Scott: I'm not gonna buy one right now But as soon as I'm the next time I'm at my house our apartment I might buy this one.

789
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:04,271
Scott: I just clicked on and I'm thinking to myself man.

790
00:49:04,291 --> 00:49:06,098
Scott: It would be really useful to have an endoscope.

791
00:49:06,158 --> 00:49:09,895
Scott: right now I'm doing I'm using like two mirrors to look at my asshole at that.

792
00:49:10,257 --> 00:49:12,286
Scott: at that moment I will click go to Amazon.

793
00:49:12,487 --> 00:49:15,520
Rym: Oh this guy stuck it into his wall to help with a cable run.

794
00:49:16,083 --> 00:49:16,626
Scott: Oh, look at that.

795
00:49:16,686 --> 00:49:17,430
Scott: How great is it?

796
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:17,872
Scott: You can wait.

797
00:49:17,993 --> 00:49:19,380
Rym: wait a lot of why is this?

798
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:25,860
Scott: Just a picture of a bathroom because a lot of people are using it on the drains of tubs and sinks to see what the Hell is down there.

799
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:26,950
Rym: But no This is just so.

800
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:29,043
Rym: the pictures are Like looking.

801
00:49:29,163 --> 00:49:34,887
Scott: so like look down your sink to see if you dropped your ring down there before you take the catch-off to say That's where it actually went.

802
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:36,154
Scott: How useful is that?

803
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:37,080
Scott: saves you so much work?

804
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:47,820
Rym: Oh, I know what I could do the livestream of go to places that like outside a building somewhere Especially in New York and just go up into like weird places that are not necessarily publicly accessible.

805
00:49:48,564 --> 00:49:49,720
Scott: Oh, you know you're walking down the street.

806
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,470
Scott: There's like a tiny hole cut in something.

807
00:49:51,872 --> 00:49:53,079
Scott: stick the endoscope through the hole.

808
00:49:53,099 --> 00:49:55,940
Scott: now You can see everything is going on back there stick it down the great.

809
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:58,074
Rym: You know all those great in New York City, you'll see greats.

810
00:49:58,114 --> 00:50:13,019
Rym: and sometimes down there It's just like the subway but sometimes like down there like when you used to go to those events down in Mercer those gaming nights at the think cafe you look down a great and it's like 50 or 60 feet deep and there's like a room down

811
00:50:13,059 --> 00:50:13,220
Scott: there.

812
00:50:13,361 --> 00:50:13,744
Scott: I got a fair.

813
00:50:13,764 --> 00:50:15,035
Scott: which endoscope has the best light?

814
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:15,620
Scott: at the end of it?

815
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:16,725
Scott: You can't get one without a light.

816
00:50:16,926 --> 00:50:19,979
Rym: this one comes with a mirror a hook and a magnet does have a light.

817
00:50:20,664 --> 00:50:21,834
Rym: I yes, there's an LED.

818
00:50:21,854 --> 00:50:22,580
Rym: You can just turn on.

819
00:50:22,821 --> 00:50:26,040
Scott: That's the important part because you're usually gonna be looking in dark places.

820
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,524
Scott: Anyway, endoscope is thing a day.

821
00:50:28,105 --> 00:50:38,140
Scott: now if you have an endoscope, you know to look at your to look at your backside there You might want to still you know, do something about protecting your front side.

822
00:50:39,501 --> 00:50:42,393
Scott: So here is a typical weigh-in for a boxing match.

823
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:59,493
Scott: I don't even know who these boxers are But one of the boxers I assume the one on the left brought his kid to the to the weigh-in which is cute and his kid like father like son, let's just say and Yeah, the guy on the right, you know, he's probably got enough money from boxing.

824
00:50:59,513 --> 00:51:01,720
Scott: I don't know if an endoscope will help him.

825
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:07,630
Rym: I Got these guys come in real quick to break it up.

826
00:51:08,271 --> 00:51:08,592
Rym: Yeah.

827
00:51:08,934 --> 00:51:13,207
Scott: Yeah, this is this is a the best 42nd video I saw today.

828
00:51:13,228 --> 00:51:15,279
Rym: Okay, it couldn't have been too bad cuz he's laughing at the.

829
00:51:15,339 --> 00:51:20,144
Scott: yeah I mean it was a little kid right but still That's it's not hit.

830
00:51:20,586 --> 00:51:21,188
Rym: Yeah strike.

831
00:51:21,449 --> 00:51:23,195
Rym: That's right in the moment.

832
00:51:23,215 --> 00:51:24,760
Rym: The booklet book is the fifth season.

833
00:51:25,481 --> 00:51:30,460
Scott: I just read a chapter of this book with some terrible secret of earth.

834
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:40,609
Rym: Holy shit, this book going places and We were at the penny arcade Expo in Seattle And we did a panel on rage quitting and guess what.

835
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:44,562
Rym: that whole panel is on YouTube in glorious 2k Mm-hmm.

836
00:51:44,863 --> 00:51:48,313
Rym: I didn't do 4k cuz that it would have been like a 30 gigabyte export.

837
00:51:48,394 --> 00:51:51,957
Scott: now this week this week We are gonna make a video of.

838
00:51:53,422 --> 00:51:55,255

00:51:55,356 --> 00:51:55,839
Scott: I'm doing it.

840
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:57,208

842
00:52:00,021 --> 00:52:02,132
Rym: We gotta do video, you know what you didn't do it the day.

843
00:52:02,212 --> 00:52:03,619
Rym: I could do it cuz you were hanging out with your mom.

844
00:52:03,841 --> 00:52:05,347
Scott: So well, you know what you're gonna do.

845
00:52:05,367 --> 00:52:06,412
Rym: Hey, what are you gonna do?

846
00:52:07,115 --> 00:52:08,120

851
00:52:23,292 --> 00:52:24,898
Rym: So we've already gone 53 minutes.

852
00:52:26,362 --> 00:52:27,908
Rym: I think we just did a tech news roundup.

853
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:30,680
Rym: No, I don't think we have time to talk about batteries.

854
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:31,282
Scott: Why not?

855
00:52:31,704 --> 00:52:32,969
Rym: because I'm hungry and we've already gone.

856
00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:35,500
Rym: an hour and ten minutes is not enough time.

857
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:37,673
Scott: But we didn't even do a main bit at all.

858
00:52:38,397 --> 00:52:38,880
Rym: We just died.

859
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:39,341

Rym: 54 minutes almost.

864
00:52:47,286 --> 00:52:48,210
Scott: it doesn't feel like that.

865
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:50,380
Scott: We don't usually don't mess up our timing like this.

866
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,070
Rym: We talked a lot in the front bit.

867
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:52,834
Rym: How do we didn't?

868
00:52:52,995 --> 00:52:53,900
