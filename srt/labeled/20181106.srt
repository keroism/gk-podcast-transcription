00:00:48,327 --> 00:00:54,984
Scott: So what I've discovered like the reason it could just it could just be because I am.

17
00:00:55,245 --> 00:00:57,619
Rym: I guess you curate your Twitter feed like I do.

18
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:04,409
Scott: I'm just well just saying like in my circle of people not just on the internet just in general like I've voted every time since I was 18.

19
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:07,020
Scott: I'm pretty sure you voted almost every time.

20
00:01:07,961 --> 00:01:10,354
Scott: Did you send some absentee ballots back to Michigan?

21
00:01:10,374 --> 00:01:19,308
Rym: Yeah, but I sent some back to Connecticut when there was a couple of midterms or all actually some off years where I didn't vote because I Was traveling overseas and I didn't set up the absentee in time.

22
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,677
Scott: I mean, you know, they weren't in beacon.

23
00:01:21,717 --> 00:01:27,478
Scott: We went to the VA Hospital the the veteran center, whatever it's called.

24
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,228
Scott: They still had the good machines.

25
00:01:31,448 --> 00:01:34,760
Rym: they moved our lever polling place to a different place.

26
00:01:35,001 --> 00:01:35,766
Scott: Yours got moved.

27
00:01:35,787 --> 00:01:39,975
Rym: it got moved last year and mine It's way further away and there's no subway.

28
00:01:40,015 --> 00:01:44,259
Scott: that takes you though Mine is so has been the same for nine years since I lived here.

29
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:50,544
Scott: Yeah, right and not only is it the same place the same two people at the desk the same two ladies at the desk Same deal.

30
00:01:50,785 --> 00:01:54,859
Scott: I don't remember the number because I know where they are even though I do know the numbers right?

31
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:05,266
Scott: The thing is for for the first time ever even more than any past election Even presidential elections There was a line today.

32
00:02:05,307 --> 00:02:08,221
Scott: at this morning before I went to work the line today I went.

33
00:02:08,241 --> 00:02:12,838
Scott: there was a line because there were five scanning machines and two of them were not working.

34
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:15,900
Rym: Oh So I saw more people in law.

35
00:02:16,042 --> 00:02:17,260
Scott: So it was two pages.

36
00:02:17,682 --> 00:02:21,618
Scott: So you got to put you got to tear it apart and you got to put in one page and then put in the other page.

37
00:02:23,022 --> 00:02:26,620
Scott: Order, it doesn't matter what orientation but you got to put anyone and then put in.

38
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,279
Rym: I watched a lot of people having a lot of trouble understanding the fact that there were two pages to deal.

39
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,219
Scott: well Because those people haven't, you know, I voted in the same place the same way nine times.

40
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,548
Scott: Yeah, and I'm a person who can whoosh.

41
00:02:38,649 --> 00:02:43,110
Scott: I wish at the MTA to buy a metro card I wish at the grocery store.

42
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:45,702
Scott: I wish to get past the TSA Right.

43
00:02:45,923 --> 00:02:47,812
Scott: I'm a person who can whoosh through things.

44
00:02:48,193 --> 00:02:49,640
Scott: people who can't whoosh through things.

45
00:02:49,781 --> 00:02:53,040
Scott: They got problems for something that for I don't know why they don't do it every year.

46
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,185
Scott: They should be used to it by now.

47
00:02:54,365 --> 00:03:00,335
Rym: So even though I like read those propositions We were voting on like a million times thought about him a lot.

48
00:03:00,355 --> 00:03:03,810
Scott: I read him again I went with I went yes.

49
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:04,011
Rym: Yes.

50
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:05,717
Scott: Yes, and I almost went yes.

51
00:03:05,797 --> 00:03:10,254
Scott: No, yes Yeah, I was thinking that too because I didn't see any compelling.

52
00:03:10,354 --> 00:03:11,899
Scott: there were a lot of people arguing for yes.

53
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:15,090
Scott: No No, there were some right-wing people arguing for no, no.

54
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:18,260
Scott: No, yeah, mostly people who had a hard-on for hating the mayor.

55
00:03:19,101 --> 00:03:19,422
Scott: That's it.

56
00:03:19,482 --> 00:03:24,637
Rym: the only complaint I could find about two was that it gives the mayor's office too much power.

57
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:31,540
Rym: it does but The risk of there being a Republican mayor in New York City in the modern era pretty low.

58
00:03:31,922 --> 00:03:36,827
Rym: And if anything, I think the next mayor is gonna be left of de Blasio Because it's the city voting.

59
00:03:36,847 --> 00:03:37,892
Rym: I don't have to worry about upstate.

60
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:41,243
Scott: Yeah, but yeah, so I just want the SES.

61
00:03:41,283 --> 00:03:41,504
Scott: Yes.

62
00:03:41,784 --> 00:03:42,587
Scott: Yeah, it's fine.

63
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:46,878
Rym: So I hope you voted and I hope you're listening to this.

64
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:47,259
Rym: cuz I'm.

65
00:03:48,481 --> 00:03:50,347
Rym: It's not in the bag, but I'm hopeful.

66
00:03:50,407 --> 00:03:51,270
Rym: That's all I'm gonna say.

67
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:54,000
Rym: Okay, you're probably here to escape from all that.

68
00:03:54,302 --> 00:03:55,050
Scott: Yeah, that's what I'm.

69
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,979
Scott: that's what I got to say.

70
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:01,335
Scott: Right is that there's too many people who like sit around all night constantly watching.

71
00:04:01,355 --> 00:04:02,579
Rym: I'm gonna do that as it.

72
00:04:02,619 --> 00:04:04,632
Scott: yeah That's you know, that's fucking stupid.

73
00:04:04,692 --> 00:04:07,546
Scott: right when I'm playing a board But I'm playing a board game.

74
00:04:08,028 --> 00:04:13,020
Scott: if I take my turn and I can't do anything till it's my turn again I just get up from the table.

75
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,573
Scott: I don't got to pay attention to what the fuck's going on until it's my.

76
00:04:15,633 --> 00:04:18,329
Scott: until I can do something again You can't do nothing right?

77
00:04:18,409 --> 00:04:20,140
Scott: Well, do I need to sit there while the score is counted?

78
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,980
Scott: No, I'll just come back and find out after everyone else finished counting the score.

79
00:04:23,161 --> 00:04:23,743
Scott: It's tough though.

80
00:04:23,803 --> 00:04:27,420
Scott: And this is a board game where I don't get another turn until next fucking year.

81
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:29,026
Scott: So I don't got to do nothing.

82
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:30,834
Scott: Why should I pay attention all night for no reason?

83
00:04:30,874 --> 00:04:32,260
Scott: I'm gonna watch ice hockey.

84
00:04:32,642 --> 00:04:34,449
Scott: Yeah, there's a good ice hockey.

85
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:35,915
Scott: I'm gonna play some video games.

86
00:04:36,177 --> 00:04:36,819
Scott: I'm gonna read a book.

87
00:04:37,304 --> 00:04:38,600
Scott: So I'm gonna watch a little ice hockey.

88
00:04:38,681 --> 00:04:46,440
Rym: But I got a better plan to avoid cuz I am compelled because I have this weird duality where there's the rational like.

89
00:04:46,901 --> 00:04:49,913
Rym: I have put the input into the system that I can and there's nothing I can do.

90
00:04:49,933 --> 00:04:51,218
Rym: and then there's the.

91
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:56,613
Rym: I Appreciate this as a spectacle and enjoy watching it burn.

92
00:04:56,674 --> 00:05:00,471
Scott: You know what a better spectacle is hockey 39 saves baby.

93
00:05:00,996 --> 00:05:03,151

00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:38,569
Scott: If you don't own it then you lost it.

136
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:40,457
Scott: or someone stole it or you sold it someone who.

137
00:06:40,477 --> 00:06:41,020
Rym: I just stolen it.

138
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,108
Scott: It was a copy in the house in Beacon.

139
00:06:43,128 --> 00:06:43,851
Scott: We played it once.

140
00:06:43,911 --> 00:06:44,955
Scott: it belonged to not me.

141
00:06:45,316 --> 00:06:45,577
Rym: Yep.

142
00:06:45,758 --> 00:06:46,320
Scott: I didn't buy it.

143
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,148
Rym: I only remember playing it with Luke.

144
00:06:48,168 --> 00:06:50,700
Rym: Are you sure Alex didn't own it and he just left it in our house?

145
00:06:51,081 --> 00:06:51,764
Scott: That's possible.

146
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:55,600
Rym: I think Alex owned it because the other game Alex owns that we cannot get is Vinci.

147
00:06:55,921 --> 00:06:56,785
Scott: I mean, that's possible.

148
00:06:56,866 --> 00:06:57,469
Scott: But what?

149
00:06:57,489 --> 00:06:59,860
Rym: how much money I'd have to give Alex to get his Vinci from him?

150
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,845
Scott: I'm sure he's not using it.

151
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:02,976
Rym: Yeah, but I don't know if you'd want to part with it.

152
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:03,720
Scott: I wouldn't either.

153
00:07:03,941 --> 00:07:10,002
Rym: So the other thing that I did when we're getting into the news is as you know Overwatch Competitive.

154
00:07:10,203 --> 00:07:12,713
Scott: well, well, it was it was it was Blizzcon.

00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:26,700
Scott: Also, there is a new Starcraft 2 champion who is not from Korea.

159
00:07:26,841 --> 00:07:31,099
Scott: The first time ever a non-korean made it to the finals and the first time ever a non-korean won.

160
00:07:31,901 --> 00:07:34,414
Scott: Congratulations, I forget your name and I don't have it on my screen.

161
00:07:34,998 --> 00:07:49,419
Rym: So I Tried something I decided at the end of the previous competitive season to do something I've never done and because when I play overwatch, it's always like super chill people because I'm usually playing with like Gold's Maybe some Platinum's maybe upper Silver's at most.

162
00:07:50,042 --> 00:07:55,940
Rym: So, uh, I joined the random solo queue by myself to do ten placement matches.

163
00:07:56,141 --> 00:08:02,425
Rym: Uh, yeah, holy fuck are the worst people on earth Doing that?

164
00:08:02,786 --> 00:08:06,320
Rym: I got put with teams with the things that I noticed the most are number one.

165
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:14,333
Rym: There is always always always 100% of the time a group of two That is together in the game with a bunch of randos who never joined the voice chat.

166
00:08:14,373 --> 00:08:23,983
Rym: never communicate and lose the game for you okay, and to Every single person who was salty in the voice chat was French Canadian Mm-hmm.

167
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:27,340
Rym: I don't know if it was just an artifact of when I was playing a beer geography.

168
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:31,272
Rym: Yeah, right every time someone was getting real butter.

169
00:08:31,292 --> 00:08:33,400
Rym: It sounded French Canadian.

170
00:08:35,062 --> 00:08:37,759
Rym: But that was at the end of the season like three days to go.

171
00:08:38,322 --> 00:08:42,860
Rym: So I made it six matches in and it was so bad that I just stopped and I even stopped livestreaming.

172
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,381
Rym: I just gave up.

173
00:08:43,883 --> 00:08:49,080
Rym: so I did it again at the beginning of the season and it was like night and day.

174
00:08:49,703 --> 00:08:58,568
Rym: I actually found some good people and I played some real games and My new plan is to just play rando competitive overwatch Rank be damned.

175
00:08:58,628 --> 00:09:01,360
Rym: Let's just ride this train straight into hell, right?

176
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:11,120
Scott: Well, I mean that's the Hearthstone is the same thing because the way they do the seasons and most Blizzard games Right with their ranks and ladders is they give you everyone a big reset or whatever and every month.

177
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,499
Scott: So what happens at the beginning of the month?

178
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:19,800
Scott: Everyone is doing the same thing and getting back into it has been d ranked or has to place match again.

179
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:25,500
Scott: So because you're in with everyone you get matched really well with people who are close to your level, right?

180
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,280
Scott: You know things are doing good, right?

181
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:43,299
Scott: But then at the end of the month if you're still doing like placement matches or you're like You know low ranks at the end of the month Like if you play Hearthstone at the end of the month ranked and you didn't play all month because you're just not that into it I can just like get win streak like up like ding ding ding ding.

182
00:09:44,986 --> 00:09:49,528
Scott: But if I play in the early part of the month It's like depending on how much I've been downranked.

183
00:09:49,949 --> 00:09:53,500
Scott: It's like yeah, there's people there who are about my level who also got down, right?

184
00:09:54,140 --> 00:10:02,142
Rym: Everything's still about where it belongs, you know, so in some news The TLDR is Salty.

185
00:10:02,182 --> 00:10:10,211
Rym: babies are mad that a company released a game that is not targeted at them Mm-hmm, and they're mad enough to have tanked Blizzard stock.

186
00:10:11,134 --> 00:10:19,900
Rym: I don't know how the stock market so stupid And What all I want to say is nothing I am about to say is investment advice.

187
00:10:20,302 --> 00:10:22,391
Rym: I am NOT giving you investment advice.

188
00:10:22,752 --> 00:10:29,797
Rym: I am simply talking about decisions I have made and personal opinions I have based on publicly available information.

189
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,079
Rym: I Have to say that a lot on getting nice.

190
00:10:34,221 --> 00:10:35,184
Rym: So here's the deal.

191
00:10:35,745 --> 00:10:37,089
Rym: Blizzard has Blizzcon.

192
00:10:37,651 --> 00:10:40,318
Rym: Uh, I wouldn't go to Blizzcon, but this comes like.

193
00:10:40,358 --> 00:10:40,920
Rym: it's not bad.

194
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,324
Rym: It's not like.

195
00:10:41,344 --> 00:10:44,787
Rym: I guess I mean Where they fuck it up.

196
00:10:44,947 --> 00:10:47,175
Scott: It's better than e3 or twitchcon.

197
00:10:47,276 --> 00:10:48,500
Rym: I think it's more like going.

198
00:10:48,944 --> 00:10:50,800
Scott: I just don't see a real reason to go there.

199
00:10:51,101 --> 00:10:52,468
Scott: We were discussing this on the forum.

200
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:53,312
Scott: right is the most of?

201
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:54,800
Scott: Blizzcon is an advertisement.

202
00:10:55,241 --> 00:10:59,113
Scott: So why would you pay and travel to attend an advertisement?

203
00:10:59,133 --> 00:11:03,238
Rym: No, I would say based on the content edit It's more like going to AGD queue.

204
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,509
Scott: AGD queue isn't really the greatest thing to attend either.

205
00:11:06,569 --> 00:11:08,136
Scott: but at least it's not an advertisement.

206
00:11:08,176 --> 00:11:10,544
Scott: and if it is an advertisement It's an advertisement for charity.

207
00:11:10,564 --> 00:11:21,240
Scott: A big part of cons like that like both of those is The drinking and hanging out outside of the con which is you can do that without buying a badge.

208
00:11:21,441 --> 00:11:22,183
Scott: I'm not I'm not.

209
00:11:22,284 --> 00:11:25,014
Scott: I'm not judging anyone for attending a gathering.

210
00:11:25,315 --> 00:11:27,558
Scott: attending a gathering is great No matter where it is.

211
00:11:27,901 --> 00:11:29,648
Scott: I'm saying why buy the badge?

212
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:41,400
Scott: right if Pax did not have anything valuable on the inside of it And I still wanted to attend to gather I would honestly just go to Paxes that are nearby and not go into the Pax and not buy a badge.

213
00:11:41,623 --> 00:11:48,480
Scott: In fact, I hate to say this I'm only judging the buying a badge and going inside value not be going to hang out with people value.

214
00:11:49,043 --> 00:11:55,990
Rym: But anyway, like Blizzcon is fine because it's at least it's run well Unlike twitchcon like it doesn't fail in basic ways,

215
00:11:56,371 --> 00:11:56,591
Scott: but

216
00:11:57,113 --> 00:12:02,428
Rym: at Blizzcon they announced that there's going to be a Diablo Mobile game an MMO for phones

217
00:12:02,669 --> 00:12:12,538
Scott: and I was like, oh I can clear that's actually you know It's like Diablo is a game where you mindlessly click on monsters and get loot and then you do it again and again and again And get better loot and more stats.

218
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,194
Rym: and Was that is just Diablo, right?

219
00:12:16,234 --> 00:12:17,100
Scott: That's what Diablo is.

220
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,952
Scott: So I'm like, you know what that kind of game.

221
00:12:18,992 --> 00:12:27,718
Scott: if you're sitting at your PC You really want to play a mindless game like that and very rarely maybe once every couple years I'll spend like a day playing a stupid game like that.

222
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:32,420
Scott: Yeah In fact, I just played like a $1 do-nothing steam game for like it for like a few hours.

223
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,466
Rym: But it's like you put that.

224
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:38,336
Scott: if you put that garbage on my phone it's like.

225
00:12:38,376 --> 00:12:41,028
Scott: well if I'm on the subway Yeah, a garbage game is perfect.

226
00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:43,300
Scott: Yeah, especially if I can play it on the toilet.

227
00:12:43,861 --> 00:12:44,263
Scott: That's like.

228
00:12:44,324 --> 00:12:45,773
Scott: and I was like when I saw this news.

229
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:46,880
Scott: I was like, oh, you know what?

230
00:12:47,461 --> 00:12:49,995
Scott: I don't really want to play Diablo on my computer that often.

231
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:50,900
Scott: I played Diablo 3.

232
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,420
Scott: It took me like a couple days to beat and then I didn't play it again.

233
00:12:53,621 --> 00:12:56,150
Rym: So I saw this news and I ignored my phone.

234
00:12:56,211 --> 00:12:57,937
Scott: I'm like him maybe I thought like.

235
00:12:57,978 --> 00:12:59,646
Rym: I thought okay That's probably good for Blizzard.

236
00:12:59,747 --> 00:13:00,773
Rym: I had a bunch of Blizzard stock.

237
00:13:00,873 --> 00:13:02,020
Rym: I can see why they're doing this.

238
00:13:02,302 --> 00:13:03,572
Rym: I'll probably poke at it.

239
00:13:03,673 --> 00:13:04,500
Rym: I doubt it'll be good.

240
00:13:04,841 --> 00:13:08,439
Rym: I looked at who they're sort of outsourcing it to probably not gonna be a good game.

241
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:12,653
Scott: Yeah, no That's the thing is that when I first saw the news making it is basically a shovel.

242
00:13:12,693 --> 00:13:16,680
Scott: when I first saw the news I thought it was Blizzard making the game themselves.

243
00:13:16,841 --> 00:13:17,946
Scott: But no they gave that.

244
00:13:17,966 --> 00:13:23,900
Scott: they licensed the IP of Diablo to a company that made Garbage-o games and it's a garbage-o game.

245
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,179
Scott: And in fact people are pointing at an existing game.

246
00:13:26,521 --> 00:13:30,940
Scott: Because if it's like they're not the first person to ever think to put a Diablo action RPG on a phone.

247
00:13:31,522 --> 00:13:43,863
Scott: They pointed at an existing game that doesn't have Diablo IP obviously But it's basically looks 90% like what they showed from the Diablo and that game isn't a game I'm gonna play.

248
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:50,851
Rym: so whatever that canceled my Diablo phone plan, so it's not for me I don't care, and it'll probably make money.

249
00:13:50,891 --> 00:13:52,720
Rym: and that's basically all I thought about it.

250
00:13:53,121 --> 00:14:00,184
Rym: And then a little while later I get a stock alert because Blizzard stock dropped like 7% on this news, okay I don't know who.

251
00:14:00,244 --> 00:14:11,886
Scott: the people who so that means people know I have access to People who owned Blizzard stock chose to sell it so much that it went down 7% which is a huge percentage.

252
00:14:12,006 --> 00:14:14,073
Scott: so in a day so full disclosure.

253
00:14:14,093 --> 00:14:16,060
Rym: I own a lot of Blizzard stock.

254
00:14:16,401 --> 00:14:18,892
Rym: Yeah, okay, like I like I've it's one of my.

255
00:14:18,932 --> 00:14:20,600
Rym: it's a big part of my portfolio.

256
00:14:21,302 --> 00:14:26,380
Scott: So I immediately wonder what percentage of my index fund portfolio, so I immediately have a minor amount of pressure.

257
00:14:26,602 --> 00:14:27,813
Scott: I own some indirectly.

258
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:35,000
Rym: oh Did something go wrong, and I didn't in any way think that this was gonna be related to anything that happened at Blizzcon.

259
00:14:35,121 --> 00:14:38,060
Rym: I assume there was some like event that it like something happened.

260
00:14:38,803 --> 00:14:40,711
Rym: And then I like I have access to a bloomer terminal.

261
00:14:40,751 --> 00:14:41,976
Rym: so I start poking around the news.

262
00:14:42,539 --> 00:14:42,820
Rym: nothing.

263
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:51,660
Rym: There's nothing other than that trending hashtag not my Diablo and salty babies flipping out in social media.

264
00:14:52,781 --> 00:14:58,600
Rym: So basically the best I can tell is like what happened is that this announcement occurred.

265
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:10,560
Rym: Hedge funds and real investors who like know what they're doing looked at and said wow a game company That's good at what they're doing is taking a popular IP and going international with it because that's exactly what they're doing.

266
00:15:11,102 --> 00:15:19,912
Rym: When you want to go international with a game especially if you want to go into say China Eastern Europe you basically make a shovelware MMO, and it makes shit tons of money.

267
00:15:19,932 --> 00:15:20,574
Rym: That's like what you do.

268
00:15:20,594 --> 00:15:21,216
Rym: That's like.

269
00:15:21,256 --> 00:15:21,978
Rym: That's fine.

270
00:15:22,179 --> 00:15:26,846
Rym: Yep and I Guess and this is all pure speculation.

271
00:15:26,867 --> 00:15:39,380
Rym: I have to like really disclaim this is that what happened is that most entities that invest in gaming Don't actually have a lot of people who really know a lot about gaming that are making these decisions?

272
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:39,902
Rym: They're investing.

273
00:15:40,082 --> 00:15:41,266
Scott: I'm one of my co-workers.

274
00:15:41,286 --> 00:15:45,179
Scott: Who's very young and I think somewhat naive, but not the naivest right.

275
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:45,380
Scott: you know.

276
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,192
Scott: There's those naive investors who are like doing real stupid shit, and yeah shit.

277
00:15:49,433 --> 00:15:55,100
Scott: He's a couple levels above that right yeah But he's big on investing in game companies cuz he knows a lot.

278
00:15:55,180 --> 00:16:03,317
Scott: He knows as much about video games as any of us normal game And I invest in like Hasbro and Blizzard and likes the kind of companies.

279
00:16:03,357 --> 00:16:04,180
Rym: I know a lot about right.

280
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:04,803
Scott: You know he's.

281
00:16:05,024 --> 00:16:07,540
Scott: he's buying and selling game stocks, and I guess he's making money.

282
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,359
Scott: He's not poor and he's has a normal job, too.

283
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,920
Scott: He's not doing it like he's not obviously not day trading because I see him sitting there coding all day.

284
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:19,449
Scott: So it's made like it's obviously not a negative gambling behavior I've made like irresponsible level.

285
00:16:19,629 --> 00:16:22,940
Rym: I've made over a hundred percent gains year over a year for two years in a row.

286
00:16:23,222 --> 00:16:28,532
Scott: Yeah, it's like if you're an expert on something And there's nobody playing the market who's also an expert on the thing.

287
00:16:28,632 --> 00:16:34,109
Scott: you can make money even without insider Trading with the specific knowledges about specific companies.

288
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:37,379
Scott: yeah, because I don't know any because you have general knowledge right.

289
00:16:37,419 --> 00:16:39,649
Scott: for example Let's say you're investing in pharmaceuticals.

290
00:16:39,669 --> 00:16:41,900
Scott: a lot of experts are investing in pharmaceuticals.

291
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,087
Scott: It's tough to compete there.

292
00:16:43,328 --> 00:16:45,380
Scott: the markets probably gonna move in the correct direction.

293
00:16:46,224 --> 00:16:51,926
Scott: But if you're investing in like you know lasers How many laser experts are there?

294
00:16:51,986 --> 00:16:56,380
Scott: and if you see like a paper like who someone invented some cool new tech or something and you?

295
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:01,577
Scott: Know that certain company is the most positioned to move on that or whatever.

296
00:17:01,597 --> 00:17:02,300
Rym: so here's an aside.

297
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,780
Rym: I'm gonna tell her that's gonna ruin another company's business.

298
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:06,345
Scott: They're not prepared for this new.

299
00:17:06,506 --> 00:17:12,089
Rym: and you know the first time I ever made like real money in the stock market was a long long Time ago when I first bought stock.

300
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:13,257
Rym: I was like I'm a buy stock.

301
00:17:13,297 --> 00:17:16,680
Rym: cuz I'm smart I know what I'm doing which was probably a mistake cuz I didn't know.

302
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:24,940
Scott: I won the stock market game in When I was in seventh grade, and then we went to the stock exchange.

303
00:17:25,501 --> 00:17:27,487
Scott: Yeah, and then they took us to McDonald's.

304
00:17:27,988 --> 00:17:31,698
Rym: so basically I saw all those news stories.

305
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:46,700
Rym: remember when Toyota Like a long time ago had the issue were like the accelerator was getting stuck and killing people yep And I saw that story and I saw Toyota's stock just collapse And I thought to myself That is definitely just old people messing up the pedals.

306
00:17:46,972 --> 00:17:48,385
Rym: Yeah There is no way.

307
00:17:48,888 --> 00:17:51,680
Rym: this problem is like is a real mechanical problem.

308
00:17:52,001 --> 00:18:01,235
Rym: And I base this on the fact that just because of being someone who reads FARC There are so many stories of old people making that mistake and like it.

309
00:18:01,275 --> 00:18:02,780
Rym: like that is a common problem.

310
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,189
Rym: It is a shockingly common cause of accidents.

311
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:12,544
Rym: is old people hit the accelerator instead of the brake yep And then they hit it harder when the car doesn't stop mm-hmm Other.

312
00:18:12,604 --> 00:18:19,167
Rym: the other thing that commonly causes that is old people will like Shove the floor mat on top of the pedal.

313
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:24,568
Rym: Yeah, that's the other thing that happens a lot yep, so I thought there's no way There's a real problem here.

314
00:18:24,588 --> 00:18:25,253
Rym: That's ridiculous.

315
00:18:25,273 --> 00:18:26,260
Rym: Toyota's a smart company.

316
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,295
Scott: It wouldn't fuck up that bad.

317
00:18:28,102 --> 00:18:35,454
Rym: So I took literally all my savings and bought Toyota stock and I made a shit ton of money Relative to how much money I had back.

318
00:18:35,494 --> 00:18:39,500
Rym: when it bounces back Yeah, cuz like a few weeks later are people not buying Toyota's now.

319
00:18:40,323 --> 00:18:43,052
Scott: Then I learned that buying Toyota's just as much as any other car.

320
00:18:43,112 --> 00:18:49,080
Scott: so then I learned that space and it's also that's a very popular Call me the most popular car up there with Honda.

321
00:18:49,120 --> 00:19:00,558
Rym: It's basically contra investing where you believe that a stock has tanked or is otherwise undervalued Because you have domain specific knowledge not insider domain specific knowledge FARC articles.

322
00:19:00,859 --> 00:19:01,140
Scott: Yeah.

323
00:19:02,185 --> 00:19:09,860
Rym: So in the gaming sector what I guess happened Is that most people who invest in games don't really know a lot about it.

324
00:19:10,181 --> 00:19:19,071
Rym: so the algos that actually deal with these investments are primarily driven by Clever people who think that they want to base stuff on sentiment.

325
00:19:19,172 --> 00:19:19,653
Scott: Yeah, they got.

326
00:19:19,694 --> 00:19:36,780
Scott: there's a lot of sentiment analysis stuff That's very popular these days not just for Investing but also just for like, you know looking at social media like the bunch of tweets It'll search for something and collect a bunch of tweets and they be like, ah, we did sentiment analysis on all these tweets This search and it turned up negative.

327
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:41,420
Scott: So that means the populace as a general has a negative feeling about this thing.

328
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:58,220
Rym: We search for our positive feelings about this thing with the fact that like that hashtag was trending Probably in my personal opinion triggered a lot of sell-off Algos on the worry that people wanted to be ahead of the fact that this game company messed something up in gamers.

329
00:19:58,361 --> 00:19:58,805
Rym: No better.

330
00:19:58,845 --> 00:19:59,833
Rym: Let's trust the gamers.

331
00:20:00,337 --> 00:20:01,900
Rym: Mm-hmm And that's ridiculous.

332
00:20:02,663 --> 00:20:13,979
Rym: And as far as I can tell like hedge funds and people like the people who invest in games who hire Subject matter experts to advise them are probably doubling down on Activision Blizzard right now.

333
00:20:14,523 --> 00:20:16,660
Rym: That's my guess and I to him doubling down.

334
00:20:17,102 --> 00:20:22,988
Rym: I bought a lot of Activision Blizzard stock today because of this better Hope you write because you lose a lot of money.

335
00:20:23,149 --> 00:20:27,913
Rym: Well also one I've never lost money and two I only invest for like the five-year ten-year horizon.

336
00:20:27,933 --> 00:20:28,979
Rym: Like I don't ever sell stock.

337
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,628
Scott: really My index funds are still killing it.

338
00:20:31,668 --> 00:20:33,132
Rym: so killing it by what?

339
00:20:33,152 --> 00:20:36,608
Rym: if you made a hundred percent year-over-year two years in a row I don't need a hundred percent.

340
00:20:36,628 --> 00:20:40,850
Scott: I'm gonna I'm gonna have listen No, but none of us even make it a hundred percent.

341
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:43,140
Scott: gonna have enough money to mathematically retire.

342
00:20:43,341 --> 00:20:47,040
Rym: No, my retirement plan is a combination of Mad Max and communism.

343
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:51,574
Scott: But here's the thing is that all the other people our age all the other Millennials, right?

344
00:20:51,775 --> 00:20:53,219
Scott: They have nothing for retirement.

345
00:20:53,761 --> 00:20:55,672
Rym: That is also terrifying.

346
00:20:55,692 --> 00:20:57,080
Scott: All right, it's very terrifying.

347
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:02,680
Scott: So the fact that I have any amount I figure even though it's not enough.

348
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:14,912
Scott: Like if I had to retire today, obviously enough enough money, even if you add the you know, 20 whatever years of more investing It's still not enough money to retire But I'll have so much more than everyone else.

349
00:21:15,132 --> 00:21:16,537
Scott: So won't I be able to get?

350
00:21:16,577 --> 00:21:17,600
Scott: I'll be doing alright.

351
00:21:17,801 --> 00:21:21,495
Rym: So Scott my retirement stuff is like your retirement stuff.

352
00:21:21,997 --> 00:21:22,640
Rym: This is separate.

353
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,529
Rym: This isn't money for when I'm seven.

354
00:21:24,589 --> 00:21:27,020
Scott: not most people are not wealthy enough to have extra money.

355
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:39,110
Rym: Yeah, these investments are from when I'm like uncle money bangs or D. Yeah, I am also taking a huge amount of risk by putting almost all my savings Yeah liquid cash in a relatively small number of chosen equities.

356
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:42,459
Rym: That's what I keep saying, but it's never gotten me wrong so far.

357
00:21:43,722 --> 00:21:46,097
Scott: But anyway, I'm doing great putting it on red.

358
00:21:46,117 --> 00:21:46,580
Scott: It's been red.

359
00:21:47,485 --> 00:21:50,846
Rym: I Mean, I can't go wrong.

360
00:21:51,027 --> 00:21:52,872
Rym: all gills gonna eat food tonight.

361
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:54,297
Scott: I'll put it on black this time.

362
00:21:54,317 --> 00:21:56,303
Scott: Oh shit zero That's an option.

363
00:21:56,344 --> 00:22:00,540
Rym: What what's that is green the wolves in on old gills doorstep.

364
00:22:02,163 --> 00:22:04,960
Rym: But anyway, I think this is ridiculous.

365
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,984
Rym: I think the people who are mad about this are being ridiculous The anyone.

366
00:22:09,285 --> 00:22:13,599
Rym: and what's weird is this news made it into like basic culture.

367
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:20,834
Rym: people I know in the real world who know nothing about games Heard about this and they were all mad about it for the same reason.

368
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:24,019
Rym: the reason they were mad They all said the same thing they said.

369
00:22:24,421 --> 00:22:31,158
Rym: But what about all the people who spent thousands of dollars to fly to Blizzcon only to get this instead of Diablo 4 like?

370
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,285
Scott: That's what I was saying before.

371
00:22:34,365 --> 00:22:38,860
Scott: why are you flying and paying to go to witness an advertisement in person?

372
00:22:39,442 --> 00:22:41,387
Scott: Get what you deserve pay and fly.

373
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:45,338
Rym: that is one to watch games and get drunk with your friends and hang out.

374
00:22:45,378 --> 00:22:47,707
Rym: don't fly there To get a press release.

375
00:22:48,008 --> 00:22:48,631
Scott: you can get the.

376
00:22:48,731 --> 00:22:49,856
Scott: I got the same press release.

377
00:22:49,896 --> 00:22:53,036
Scott: it cost me nothing And also I didn't get advertised.

378
00:22:53,077 --> 00:22:53,500
Scott: in the face.

379
00:22:53,781 --> 00:22:55,387
Rym: I think they're Diablo.

380
00:22:55,588 --> 00:22:58,098
Rym: MMO for phones is going to make a shit ton of money.

381
00:22:58,379 --> 00:23:00,249
Rym: probably It's just not for you.

382
00:23:00,269 --> 00:23:02,180
Rym: Diablo 4 will come out when it comes.

383
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:06,902
Scott: I wonder how much money goes to the company that made it and how much goes to blizzard The other.

384
00:23:06,942 --> 00:23:17,818
Rym: but basically if you're a fan of a thing that doesn't mean you get to say how said thing is made and you're Probably not the most important factor in the decisions that are being made.

385
00:23:17,939 --> 00:23:24,190
Scott: also If the thing you know if there's an if there's an intellectual property you like and it gets attached to something You know it's like.

386
00:23:24,292 --> 00:23:31,115
Scott: I like Megaman, right This good Megaman stuff Megaman 11 just came out whatever 12.

387
00:23:31,115 --> 00:23:35,720
Scott: I don't fucking know yeah But I still like Megaman yeah.

388
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:40,840
Scott: And then they come up like a crappy Megaman board game and a crappy Megaman cartoon and a Megaman battle network.

389
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,368
Rym: It's I don't give a shit about a network.

390
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:44,440
Scott: I don't give a crap about any of that garbage, right?

391
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:44,964
Scott: But it's like.

392
00:23:44,984 --> 00:23:46,519
Scott: I don't have to stop liking Megaman.

393
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:50,120
Scott: I don't have to be mad that they applied the Megaman IP to something else.

394
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:54,836
Scott: It's like okay They applied the Diablo IP to something else that you don't give a shit about.

395
00:23:55,218 --> 00:23:55,760
Scott: who cares?

396
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:58,769
Rym: The creation of art is not a zero-sum game.

397
00:23:58,849 --> 00:24:00,374
Rym: kids like it's not like.

398
00:24:00,414 --> 00:24:03,664
Scott: there's a limited amount of things the Diablo IP can be applied to.

399
00:24:03,684 --> 00:24:08,297
Scott: you could literally we could remake everything on earth so that everything has the Diablo IP.

400
00:24:08,377 --> 00:24:09,340
Scott: every movie is Diablo.

401
00:24:10,941 --> 00:24:11,363
Scott: Every.

402
00:24:11,443 --> 00:24:12,768
Scott: every TV show is Diablo.

403
00:24:12,788 --> 00:24:16,745
Scott: the TV show The main character is always Satan.

404
00:24:17,006 --> 00:24:19,492
Rym: every time so occasionally a game will be made.

405
00:24:19,532 --> 00:24:22,620
Rym: that is not for you specifically crying nerd on Twitter.

406
00:24:23,063 --> 00:24:32,180
Rym: Yeah in other news riot The other big game company, and this is pretty breaking news like a little while like earlier today, right?

407
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,740
Scott: So this today's today's news is like a double news from riot, right?

408
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:41,080
Scott: So the news from today is that a current and former employees are suing riot for gender discrimination.

409
00:24:41,221 --> 00:24:42,928
Scott: And I all I got to say is I'm not surprised.

410
00:24:43,029 --> 00:24:45,520
Scott: every video game company hasn't been super gender discrimination.

411
00:24:45,581 --> 00:24:46,550
Rym: Yeah, I'm not surprised.

412
00:24:46,631 --> 00:24:52,278
Rym: and age-discriminated Every company is not sued for gender discrimination and age discrimination.

413
00:24:52,398 --> 00:24:53,924
Rym: Yeah I mean, I've already got.

414
00:24:54,486 --> 00:24:59,996
Rym: we're getting to the point like in four more years Scott and I are gonna be age-discriminated Again, it's gonna happen probably.

415
00:25:00,178 --> 00:25:02,606
Rym: yeah I'm already I'm already.

416
00:25:02,827 --> 00:25:05,299
Rym: it's weird how much older I am than a lot of people I work with.

417
00:25:06,584 --> 00:25:08,560
Rym: But yeah, so right is straight up being sued.

418
00:25:09,505 --> 00:25:10,440
Rym: You can read the article.

419
00:25:10,668 --> 00:25:18,424
Rym: I mean I'm Definitely not going to give you legal advice or talk about a legal issue like this because I know a lot less about this than I do about the stock market.

420
00:25:18,444 --> 00:25:19,950
Rym: Mm-hmm, and I don't know a lot about.

421
00:25:20,091 --> 00:25:21,677
Scott: I know what the HR people tell me.

422
00:25:21,958 --> 00:25:23,582
Rym: Yep But

423
00:25:23,702 --> 00:25:28,476
Scott: and they can't be trusted all completely because they're on they're there to defend the company not to defend

424
00:25:28,536 --> 00:25:40,920
Rym: lizard like the people I know in the industry who know a lot about the inside of Blizzard like Activision Blizzard Tend to have positive things to say like crunch isn't bad Like it seems like it's a reasonably okay place to work for a big.

425
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:44,940
Scott: It's not as bad as the other game companies at least in at least one or two ways.

426
00:25:45,301 --> 00:25:47,086
Rym: It seems neutral to slightly positive.

427
00:25:47,126 --> 00:25:49,232
Rym: is the what the impression I get from the average person?

428
00:25:49,854 --> 00:25:54,830
Rym: the impression I get about riot Is pretty bad and pretty bro II.

429
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:55,974
Rym: like I get the impression.

430
00:25:56,074 --> 00:26:05,260
Scott: only thing I've ever gotten a good impression About riot is that they seem to actually put in an effort and try to get shitheads out of their player base.

431
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:08,710
Rym: Yeah, and community, but they don't go as far as Kaplan with overwatch.

432
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:11,820
Rym: who's like I will fucking ban you for quitting a game.

433
00:26:12,402 --> 00:26:13,587
Rym: Let's go bring it.

434
00:26:13,607 --> 00:26:14,712
Rym: What are you gonna ban?

435
00:26:14,732 --> 00:26:15,295
Rym: ban for life?

436
00:26:15,335 --> 00:26:16,520
Rym: Oh, you made a new account band.

437
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,605
Rym: It's like that your money didn't?

438
00:26:17,645 --> 00:26:18,650
Scott: we do a story on geek?

439
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:19,494
Scott: that's a while ago.

440
00:26:19,715 --> 00:26:20,760
Scott: We didn't do the story.

441
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:25,720
Scott: We discussed the story where like that the worst possible guy was finally unbanned after a super long time.

442
00:26:26,545 --> 00:26:28,317
Scott: I would never unban the worst possible guy.

443
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:31,752
Rym: be like nope That's so I'm gonna run just gonna quote the article because this is everything that needs to be said.

444
00:26:31,792 --> 00:26:33,720
Rym: the class-action lawsuit alleges that quote.

445
00:26:34,281 --> 00:26:40,360
Rym: Like many of riots games female employees plaintiffs have been denied equal pay and found their careers stifled because there are women more.

446
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:50,440
Rym: So plaintiffs have also seen their working conditions negatively impacted because of the ongoing sexual harassment misconduct and bias which predominate these sexually hostile working environment of riot games.

447
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:50,962
Scott: I believe it.

448
00:26:51,565 --> 00:26:54,580
Rym: I have no reason to do in any way.

449
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:59,378
Scott: I mean if someone said that and replaced that company name with literally any company name, I would say I believe it.

450
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:01,135
Scott: Yeah It's like this.

451
00:27:02,207 --> 00:27:03,799
Scott: What a company would I not believe it?

452
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,123
Rym: You know what the exceptions would be?

453
00:27:05,404 --> 00:27:10,700
Rym: Scott companies that are so small that I personally know literally every employee of that company.

454
00:27:11,462 --> 00:27:14,088
Rym: Yeah, maybe then I would be able to argue against it.

455
00:27:14,229 --> 00:27:21,232
Rym: maybe but I do get the impression that riots kind of egregious compared to Even other game companies and like that.

456
00:27:21,292 --> 00:27:23,442
Rym: this rumblings been around for a long time Like this is.

457
00:27:23,582 --> 00:27:25,571
Rym: this is just that's a common rumbling.

458
00:27:25,892 --> 00:27:27,037
Rym: and now there's this lawsuit.

459
00:27:27,298 --> 00:27:30,152
Rym: Mm-hmm Of course, my thing of the day is also hanging out here.

460
00:27:30,172 --> 00:27:39,147
Rym: So I think it's time for Things of the day about that.

461
00:27:39,388 --> 00:27:42,920
Rym: So riot if you didn't know there have been music videos.

462
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:46,959
Rym: They're basically like League of Legends, but like real music video.

463
00:27:47,481 --> 00:27:54,854
Scott: I mean, you know all these companies nowadays actually seem to be doing something I think is smart which is you got a video game coming out.

464
00:27:54,914 --> 00:27:55,778
Scott: Maybe it's triple-a, right?

465
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,065
Scott: Maybe it's not.

466
00:27:57,347 --> 00:27:58,091
Scott: you want to promote it.

467
00:27:58,172 --> 00:27:59,360
Scott: You can a put out a demo.

468
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:04,000
Scott: Well, if you put in a demo people play it and then they don't buy a game because they got everything they needed from the demo.

469
00:28:04,522 --> 00:28:05,385
Scott: You can make a trailer.

470
00:28:05,586 --> 00:28:06,489
Scott: trailers are pretty good.

471
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:07,895
Scott: Yeah, a lot of trailers.

472
00:28:07,935 --> 00:28:09,220
Scott: They have some bull shots in them.

473
00:28:09,361 --> 00:28:12,140
Scott: So right, some of them have real game footage, right?

474
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,799
Scott: But trailer trailers are okay for promoting your game.

475
00:28:15,241 --> 00:28:26,819
Scott: what I see lately as I think might be the best way to promote a game or at least I like it the most is Create content with the IP That's free just on YouTube to promote the game.

476
00:28:27,061 --> 00:28:30,539
Scott: For example, there were those TF 2 videos with the characters meet the so-and-so.

477
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,689
Scott: Yeah, there was the watch.

478
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:34,900
Rym: does the like little movies for every character, right?

479
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:39,094
Scott: It seems like every Blizzard game is making like like the last hearthstone expansion.

480
00:28:39,114 --> 00:28:40,700
Scott: They made like a little animated series.

481
00:28:40,823 --> 00:28:41,339
Rym: Oh, who was it?

482
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,402
Rym: Someone on Twitter said something.

483
00:28:42,443 --> 00:28:51,508
Rym: the effect of Blizzard realized that they can weaponize how thirsty the average gamer is in the marketing of Right, it's like, you know you people are.

484
00:28:51,549 --> 00:28:53,315
Scott: now I think it's anyone.

485
00:28:53,335 --> 00:29:01,359
Scott: if you're making a game I think of any kind even a board game just making anything maybe anything period you want to market it create some sort of like.

486
00:29:02,201 --> 00:29:11,576
Scott: Not you know a commercial like you see on television but more like a Super Bowl commercial where it's like it's actual entertaining content that happens to include your IP.

487
00:29:11,596 --> 00:29:19,041
Scott: that is You know something that someone would want to watch on its own and that is now a promotional item for the actual Thing.

488
00:29:19,121 --> 00:29:24,097
Scott: so Katie is worlds like make transformers the cartoon to sell transformers the toy.

489
00:29:24,478 --> 00:29:33,600
Rym: So Katie D they have a DB a debut single and it is this League of Legends music video and it is fucking amazing, right?

490
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:34,703
Scott: So here's the deal, right?

491
00:29:34,763 --> 00:29:37,832
Scott: So the KDA is a is a it's.

492
00:29:37,852 --> 00:29:42,967
Scott: I don't know if it counts as a k-pop group or not But yeah, basically there's four members.

493
00:29:43,188 --> 00:29:50,320
Scott: I don't know all their names, but two of them are from re Evelyn Kaisa and Akali, right.

494
00:29:50,381 --> 00:30:01,905
Scott: so anyway two of them are from this actual kpop group called g idol and g idol is a group that came out of like was new this year and Was I became.

495
00:30:01,945 --> 00:30:03,512
Scott: I thought I was like, oh another new group.

496
00:30:03,592 --> 00:30:08,099
Scott: and then they were strangely incredibly popular I think because they have this one member.

497
00:30:08,822 --> 00:30:11,693
Scott: So, yeah, I don't know what her name is, but she's way popular.

498
00:30:11,713 --> 00:30:13,620
Scott: and then I saw her in something else and she was way good.

499
00:30:14,141 --> 00:30:21,062
Scott: But anyway, so two of the people in kata are from g idol and the two other people I think from America or something I never heard of them.

500
00:30:21,703 --> 00:30:29,871
Scott: and they sing the parts of these four characters who are computer generated Animated characters in this music video.

501
00:30:29,891 --> 00:30:30,856
Rym: They're like little characters.

502
00:30:30,896 --> 00:30:31,760
Rym: You could pick and play right?

503
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:36,016
Scott: There's like four Lowell characters wearing specific skins that were just released.

504
00:30:36,056 --> 00:30:37,079
Scott: I guess that you could buy.

505
00:30:38,421 --> 00:30:43,074
Scott: And then they're dancing and singing and then the actual singers are the four people I just mentioned.

506
00:30:43,555 --> 00:30:49,935
Scott: and then there are four other people Who created a dance the choreography for the music video?

507
00:30:49,996 --> 00:30:51,280
Rym: You sent me the link to the practice.

508
00:30:51,841 --> 00:30:56,514
Scott: So now those four people who I don't know their names their dance practice video went up today.

509
00:30:57,015 --> 00:31:01,430
Scott: So they basically created for Hatsune Miku is basically for virtual.

510
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:12,712
Scott: Yeah, they took four of their existing lol heroes Hatsune Miku them, but the singers are not digital singers They're actual for real people and the dancers are for other different real people.

511
00:31:13,133 --> 00:31:13,534
Rym: and this.

512
00:31:13,715 --> 00:31:17,592
Rym: so I saw this blow up because they've done Although there's other lol videos like this.

513
00:31:17,672 --> 00:31:18,557
Rym: There's this metal like.

514
00:31:18,577 --> 00:31:19,100
Rym: there's a bunch of them.

515
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:24,339
Rym: They're good, but I saw this blow up in my Twitter feed among like all the people I know who play lol.

516
00:31:24,945 --> 00:31:27,033
Rym: So I thought okay I should watch it and it was awesome.

517
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:33,300
Rym: and Then a little while later like a few days go by and it blows up among all my friends who hate lol.

518
00:31:34,045 --> 00:31:34,932
Scott: And then it blew it out.

519
00:31:34,952 --> 00:31:35,335
Scott: I hate lol.

520
00:31:35,355 --> 00:31:35,960
Scott: I'm just indifferent.

521
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,310
Scott: It's a MOBA just like all the other MOBA and then it.

522
00:31:38,371 --> 00:31:38,893
Rym: well, I hate.

523
00:31:38,973 --> 00:31:39,938
Rym: I hate MOBAs.

524
00:31:40,018 --> 00:31:41,967
Scott: personally I'm not really big on MOBAs.

525
00:31:41,987 --> 00:31:44,640
Scott: Yeah, I don't hate them, but I'm not into them.

526
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,364
Scott: I would put it this way.

527
00:31:45,384 --> 00:31:48,460
Scott: The thing is I would be into them if they fixed a long list of issues.

528
00:31:48,521 --> 00:31:50,402
Scott: But those issues are so egregious I can't play.

529
00:31:50,482 --> 00:31:56,943
Rym: The tropes of the game genre MOBA do not suit the personal preferences of Rym in Playing games.

530
00:31:57,043 --> 00:32:00,000
Scott: The core of the MOBA does suit the personal preferences of Scott.

531
00:32:00,803 --> 00:32:04,780
Scott: The details of every single MOBA implementation I've ever seen completely ruin it.

532
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:08,893
Rym: What's worse is even like they all get something right, but then something wrong.

533
00:32:08,913 --> 00:32:09,495
Rym: Mm-hmm.

534
00:32:09,615 --> 00:32:10,317
Rym: And I there's none.

535
00:32:10,357 --> 00:32:11,543
Rym: that just got all the things Right.

00:32:11,765 --> 00:32:12,633
Scott: I mean I can make one.

537
00:32:12,674 --> 00:32:13,219
Scott: that's too much work.

538
00:32:13,441 --> 00:32:16,660
Rym: But also I worry that if you got everything quote unquote, right?

539
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,747
Rym: You're gonna make a game that's quote unquote.

540
00:32:18,787 --> 00:32:21,096
Rym: good that no one wants to play because it isn't fun.

541
00:32:21,438 --> 00:32:21,940
Scott: I would agree.

542
00:32:23,642 --> 00:32:28,700

601
00:35:29,167 --> 00:35:35,124
Scott: and if you don't know there is a Google Doc spread a Google Sheet Out there that you can.

602
00:35:35,224 --> 00:35:36,327
Scott: that's publicly visible.

603
00:35:36,628 --> 00:35:45,967
Scott: that has all the information on every day that every packs went on sale Sold out if it sold out How much the badges cost literally everything.

604
00:35:45,987 --> 00:35:49,556
Scott: so you can plan your packs ticket purchasing whatever.

605
00:35:49,636 --> 00:35:53,279
Rym: and if you really want to go deep I'm not going to link to any instance of it.

606
00:35:53,380 --> 00:36:08,940
Rym: But a long time ago when the contract got signed for PAX East and general Boston used to just publish like everything that's gonna happen in Boston on this like it's kind of not secret Just not well-known like bureaucracy.

607
00:36:09,081 --> 00:36:15,920
Scott: Sometimes you can go to like the Convention Center website and you can see that either a Pax is listed even though it's not on the packs website.

608
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,129
Rym: You'll see like read expose something something or be.

609
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:27,702
Scott: the thing that happens actually even more often is the Convention Center has only booked Literally every single weekend except that one conspicuous weekend in March April ish Right around.

610
00:36:27,722 --> 00:36:30,474
Scott: what PAX East usually is so same for any other convention.

611
00:36:30,495 --> 00:36:35,839
Rym: if you really care You can find out the dates to every PAX East through.

612
00:36:35,899 --> 00:36:38,528
Rym: I think 2024 is as far as I've seen like.

613
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:40,193
Scott: so the schedule is.

614
00:36:40,614 --> 00:36:47,765
Rym: we got PAX Unplugged coming up first And then we got lag fest mag fest pecs out Paxis that's right.

615
00:36:47,926 --> 00:36:48,751
Scott: So that's what's coming up.

616
00:36:49,535 --> 00:36:50,340
Rym: So stay tuned.

617
00:36:50,704 --> 00:36:52,462
Rym: We're gonna be at all of them Of course.

618
00:36:52,642 --> 00:36:56,213
Scott: and the book club book is 2001 a space odyssey.

619
00:36:56,775 --> 00:37:00,895
Scott: as soon as I finished the fantasy novel I'm reading right now I'm gonna read it and then we'll do an episode.

620
00:37:01,338 --> 00:37:16,388
Rym: and If you need because again You're probably listening to this after the election happened if you need a social place to hang out on the internet that is guaranteed 100% Nazi free because Twitter still won't ban the Nazis Just say in the geek guides forum.

621
00:37:16,911 --> 00:37:17,252
Rym: That's like.

622
00:37:17,332 --> 00:37:19,260
Rym: our one rule is you can't be a nice.

623
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:27,520
Scott: Yeah You go to our website front row crew calm where you can find it literally all of our content and then from there you could Got links to all of our social medias.

624
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,306
Scott: You go to community dot.

625
00:37:29,346 --> 00:37:35,010
Scott: front row crew calm for the currently active forum and you want to look at the old forum You can still go to forum dot front row crew calm.

626
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:36,840
Scott: It's a little broken, but all the contents there?

627
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,160
Rym: Yeah, there is a shit ton of content in there.

628
00:37:39,329 --> 00:37:42,750
Rym: Yeah This forums and going for a long time and a lot.

629
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:46,100
Rym: and the scary thing is there's a number of people who post regularly.

630
00:37:46,746 --> 00:37:48,220
Rym: There's a number of people who post occasionally.

631
00:37:48,722 --> 00:37:54,860
Rym: There is a shocking number of people who have accounts and read this forum religiously, but never say anything.

632
00:37:55,141 --> 00:37:58,801
Rym: They don't say a goddamn thing, but there's a lot of content like the forums good stuff Like.

633
00:37:58,921 --> 00:37:59,182
Rym: I would.

634
00:37:59,745 --> 00:38:03,780
Rym: I would not tell you to go here if I didn't personally like use this on a daily basis.

635
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:04,683
Scott: That's also ours.

636
00:38:05,345 --> 00:38:06,348
Rym: Yeah, but I use it.

637
00:38:06,529 --> 00:38:09,660
Scott: There are people there who are wisely not GeekNights listeners.

638
00:38:10,041 --> 00:38:14,000
Rym: Yeah, I think there's more non GeekNights listeners in the GeekNights forum than there are.

639
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,467
Scott: They listen to a GeekNights.

640
00:38:15,507 --> 00:38:17,878
Scott: They join the forum and they stop listening to a GeekNights.

641
00:38:17,918 --> 00:38:20,219
Scott: Yep That is the wisest move.

642
00:38:21,862 --> 00:38:25,660
Scott: That is the the the the the the most expanded brain.

643
00:38:26,202 --> 00:38:28,269
Rym: Alright, so I thought I should make that.

644
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:28,671
Scott: that's.

645
00:38:28,691 --> 00:38:29,132
Rym: that's a good.

646
00:38:29,152 --> 00:38:30,597
Rym: that's a good expanded brain.

647
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:36,380
Rym: So Rollin rights are a genre of games that have existed for a long time.

648
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:42,198
Rym: I'm not gonna try to even like talk about the history of them because you don't know it.

649
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:43,588
Rym: No, well one I don't know it.

650
00:38:43,953 --> 00:38:49,640
Rym: and two No one gave a shit about rollin rights in like the broader like tabletop community.

651
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:55,262
Scott: Yeah, this is like a recent thing like past couple to two three years I want to say like

652
00:38:55,282 --> 00:38:56,185
Rym: maybe

653
00:38:56,225 --> 00:38:57,649
Scott: even more recent than the

654
00:38:57,729 --> 00:39:04,480
Rym: rollin rights were like creeping in here and there and like you'd occasionally see One there were more in Japan than there were like in the US.

655
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:12,954
Scott: It's a genre of tabletop games rollin right that for most of my life The only one I ever saw was Yahtzee and I didn't even realize it was a genre.

656
00:39:13,456 --> 00:39:15,525
Scott: and now over the past I you know, what was that?

657
00:39:15,565 --> 00:39:17,193
Scott: We played when did we play rolling America?

658
00:39:17,213 --> 00:39:18,499
Scott: It was a pack last PAX East.

659
00:39:19,022 --> 00:39:20,668
Rym: I think it was two packs ago.

660
00:39:20,728 --> 00:39:22,515
Scott: I think it was two PAX East ago.

661
00:39:22,555 --> 00:39:25,387
Scott: So that's when I sort of realized Oh, not another game.

662
00:39:25,467 --> 00:39:26,512
Scott: Oh this I see how it works.

663
00:39:26,532 --> 00:39:28,260
Rym: So I can think of one other rollin right?

664
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:31,956
Rym: I played as a kid that you didn't name triple Yahtzee a different Yahtzee.

665
00:39:31,976 --> 00:39:32,257
Scott: Yeah.

666
00:39:32,297 --> 00:39:34,787
Rym: Yeah, okay So the Yahtzee was way bad.

667
00:39:34,807 --> 00:39:36,875
Scott: Anyway, so is with the deal.

668
00:39:36,915 --> 00:39:50,468
Scott: a rollin right game is Exactly what it says everyone has every player has some sort of sheet alright, or it could be a dry erase board or paper with a pencil and Some sort of dice get rolled.

669
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:52,376
Scott: It could be you roll your own dice.

670
00:39:52,436 --> 00:39:53,460
Rym: It could be cards or something else.

671
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:53,901
Rym: it's right.

672
00:39:54,041 --> 00:40:12,136
Scott: some sort of random input occurs and you have to put take that random input and put it onto your board right and Then another input is generated and you put it onto your board and you continue doing this and at the end We see who's got the best board who is optimally placed.

673
00:40:12,497 --> 00:40:15,366
Scott: all these inputs Yep, right onto the board that they have.

674
00:40:15,868 --> 00:40:20,604
Rym: now this seems on this if you don't think about it a lot and we both fell for this.

675
00:40:20,644 --> 00:40:31,057
Rym: the first time I played a modern rollin right was when we played roll in America and the rules Were explained to us and we looked at each other and thought wow We're all just gonna do the exact same thing cuz we're all intelligent adults.

676
00:40:31,318 --> 00:40:32,607
Rym: No Right.

677
00:40:32,628 --> 00:40:33,200
Scott: So here's the thing.

678
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:40,679
Scott: So at the first at the first baby level of rollin right is Yahtzee right and the thing with Yahtzee is there's a luck involved Because everyone's rolling their own dice.

679
00:40:41,011 --> 00:40:41,220
Scott: Yeah.

680
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:47,200
Scott: So if I get different it's easy to optimally place and mostly easy for top to me place in Yahtzee.

681
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:47,541
Scott: We.

682
00:40:47,561 --> 00:40:53,840
Rym: sometimes it's a little trick Scott and I verified years ago with a website where you play Yahtzee nearly optimally.

683
00:40:53,860 --> 00:41:00,534
Scott: Yeah, like we play Yahtzee This is a very very early GeekNights thing of the day was was a website that will.

684
00:41:00,835 --> 00:41:07,960
Rym: basically there's an optimal Yahtzee playing Computer and you play a ton of Yahtzee and then it tells you how close your play is to perfect optimal mathematical play, right?

685
00:41:08,081 --> 00:41:16,015
Scott: So if you could say roll all the dice in advance on Yahtzee You could obviously place them optimally but because you have to place immediately after you roll.

686
00:41:16,035 --> 00:41:19,780
Scott: It's like alright I just got four of a kind but that's also a 20.

687
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,846
Scott: It's also four sixes.

688
00:41:20,866 --> 00:41:23,680
Scott: do I go 24 in the sixth column or do I go like wait?

689
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,526
Scott: I just thought of a game 28 in the.

690
00:41:25,907 --> 00:41:26,389
Rym: so here's the.

691
00:41:26,429 --> 00:41:27,573
Rym: here's the game of Yahtzee.

692
00:41:28,035 --> 00:41:34,154
Rym: to make this more like a modern roll And right so someone's turn they roll the dice and they're out there.

693
00:41:34,174 --> 00:41:38,260
Rym: the end result of these rolls Everyone has to put on their sheet, right?

694
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,570
Scott: So that that is what modern roll and rights are.

695
00:41:40,972 --> 00:41:42,500
Rym: but the problem is with Yahtzee.

696
00:41:43,241 --> 00:41:47,400
Rym: The person's going to whoever rolled the dice is then gonna like optimize the dice like they're gonna.

697
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:49,449
Scott: Oh, they're doing the rerolls in their favor.

698
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:52,040
Scott: So imagine that might be not in someone else's favor.

699
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:52,364
Rym: Yeah Oh.

700
00:41:52,520 --> 00:42:02,925
Rym: So imagine a Yahtzee game where some of the real dice get rolled in the middle and there is some sort of mechanic For everyone to affect those dice Independently are your?

701
00:42:03,286 --> 00:42:05,155
Scott: are your score sheets public or not?

702
00:42:05,275 --> 00:42:06,260
Scott: That's a big difference.

703
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,147
Rym: Yeah, I think the score sheets aren't public.

704
00:42:08,167 --> 00:42:08,951
Rym: and then it gets real.

705
00:42:09,011 --> 00:42:11,616
Scott: is then I see I see Rym or discord a board of a kind.

706
00:42:12,685 --> 00:42:13,698
Scott: I guess I reroll in this.

707
00:42:15,049 --> 00:42:18,630
Rym: So rolling I think I think there's a game there.

708
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:19,433
Rym: I gotta think about this.

709
00:42:19,714 --> 00:42:20,556
Scott: Yeah, that's not about.

710
00:42:20,577 --> 00:42:21,640
Scott: but anyway, so that's Yahtzee.

711
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:28,060
Scott: You have this luck involved where you're trying you're solving a puzzle of optimally placing these numbers into slots to get the most points.

712
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:33,298
Scott: But since your dice are not the same as everyone else's dice there's luck involved, right?

713
00:42:33,398 --> 00:42:34,422
Scott: I got a Yahtzee You didn't.

714
00:42:34,642 --> 00:42:36,932
Scott: yeah, the next level rolling right is what's happened.

715
00:42:36,992 --> 00:42:39,040
Scott: Most of these games are these days, which is okay.

716
00:42:39,122 --> 00:42:44,988
Scott: We roll dice Everyone has a sheet everyone starts with the same sheet Everyone gets the same inputs the in.

717
00:42:45,149 --> 00:42:56,219
Scott: if we gave you all the inputs if we rolled all the dice in advance You could easily Everyone could just sit there and think for a long time and optimally put all the inputs in the right slots on the sheet To get the highest score.

718
00:42:56,601 --> 00:43:02,686
Scott: But because you have to put them in one at a time and you don't know what the next inputs are going to be in The future it's like alright.

719
00:43:02,786 --> 00:43:03,729
Scott: you had to gamble for it.

720
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:04,171
Scott: Let me think.

721
00:43:04,251 --> 00:43:05,696
Scott: real simple example, right?

722
00:43:06,278 --> 00:43:06,780
Scott: Here's a game.

723
00:43:07,302 --> 00:43:09,048
Scott: There's three squares, right?

724
00:43:09,771 --> 00:43:15,940
Scott: if you put numbers in the squares in Increasing sequential order you get a perfect score.

725
00:43:16,943 --> 00:43:22,519
Scott: If any numbers are out of order, then you you know, you you lose points every time.

726
00:43:22,539 --> 00:43:22,760
Scott: a number.

727
00:43:23,362 --> 00:43:26,093
Rym: This game I roll a d-hundred a 40 is rolled.

728
00:43:26,113 --> 00:43:26,635
Rym: Where do you put it?

729
00:43:26,655 --> 00:43:27,599
Scott: Do you put it in number one?

730
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,888
Scott: Or number three, right?

731
00:43:29,988 --> 00:43:32,300
Scott: It's like I. you're sort of gambling a little bit.

732
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:35,340
Scott: So it is kind of luck, but you're also playing the odds, right?

733
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,820
Scott: I would put my 40 in the middle slot and then the next roll is a 10.

734
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:43,304
Scott: So I put that in the left slot and then the third roll is 20. ah fuck.

735
00:43:43,365 --> 00:43:43,787
Scott: I got.

736
00:43:43,868 --> 00:43:44,572
Scott: I got one row.

737
00:43:44,592 --> 00:43:45,075
Scott: It's 100.

738
00:43:45,075 --> 00:43:52,549
Rym: Yes, right Yeah, so typically what a lot of these games will have is another element where one the board will be bigger There's more places or something.

739
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:54,100
Rym: Yeah, and it doesn't have to be places.

740
00:43:54,180 --> 00:44:00,700
Rym: It can be lines it can be shapes like part of the reason why this genre I think is starting to like explode is that?

741
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:08,657
Rym: With very minimal materials you can design like very different games Like in a very minimalist fashion.

742
00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:11,450
Scott: Yep So some examples of roll and rights I've played.

743
00:44:11,671 --> 00:44:12,695
Scott: and the thing is roll and rights.

744
00:44:12,735 --> 00:44:18,013
Scott: the best thing about them Is that there's no digging people over which turns people away from games a lot.

745
00:44:18,294 --> 00:44:18,896
Scott: Yep, right?

746
00:44:19,077 --> 00:44:21,571
Rym: There's no There could be but there is.

747
00:44:21,591 --> 00:44:25,220
Scott: you can play them solitaire You can just sit there roll dice and try to get the best score.

748
00:44:25,421 --> 00:44:28,601
Rym: These are games you could theoretically have an unlimited number of players Like.

749
00:44:28,621 --> 00:44:37,100
Scott: you could have a panel where you're rolling dice at the front and everyone's yeah Just on the big screen in the front you could actually somebody should make one with jackbox technology.

750
00:44:38,401 --> 00:44:43,640
Scott: Everyone Jack everyone fills out their sheet on their phone and then in the whole room We see who got the best sheet from the same dice.

751
00:44:44,142 --> 00:44:49,970
Rym: I feel like if a pet if we're ever at a gaming con where they need extra panel content Let's run rolling rights for an entire room.

752
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:50,573
Rym: Yeah, let's make it.

753
00:44:50,593 --> 00:44:52,080
Scott: Let's make a jackbox rolling right anyway.

754
00:44:52,461 --> 00:44:56,715
Scott: So examples of roll and rights I played recently that are hot are Ganshan clever.

755
00:44:56,956 --> 00:44:59,619
Rym: That's the one I didn't play I've only played it solo.

756
00:44:59,861 --> 00:45:11,040
Scott: I think I read the rules once and I vaguely remember reading something that when you play it With other people that like the dice you don't use go to the next person and there's some sort of interactivity.

757
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:14,359
Scott: That's really fascinating which makes me it makes me want to play it with other people.

758
00:45:15,224 --> 00:45:20,128
Scott: But when you play it solo, which you can do for free on the web There's sort of a janky web app, but it totally works.

759
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:31,150
Scott: It's basically sort of like Yahtzee you roll the dice There's different dice of different colors and it's like, okay well I can use this dice for the number or for its color and then I take it and then I remove it and I roll The remaining dice and this.

760
00:45:31,514 --> 00:45:32,220
Scott: you can read the rules.

761
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:40,365
Scott: but you have a big of this really crazy score sheet and you can score in different spots on the sheet and It's like you sort of want to get.

762
00:45:40,586 --> 00:45:57,539
Scott: you can try to pick one area and get in it a whole bunch or spread your Out over different areas and then when you reach certain Milestones and certain spots on the sheet you get bonus stuff like extra dice and extra fill-ins and I guess I don't know If it's mathematically possible to fill in the whole sheet.

763
00:45:57,942 --> 00:45:58,886
Scott: I've never done that.

764
00:45:58,987 --> 00:46:04,420
Scott: but you add up a score at the end and You get you know, you try to get hundreds of points or whatever.

765
00:46:04,601 --> 00:46:12,140
Rym: so in a way this sort of functions like those rotating tournaments like in a bridge tournament where There's a table with a deck with an order of cards.

766
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:16,531
Rym: So every group plays like the same deck to see who optimizes it's all.

767
00:46:16,992 --> 00:46:29,134
Rym: it does that with a modern minimalist sensibility yep, and it does it well and the games are fun and I think rolling America is the one I played the most.

768
00:46:29,314 --> 00:46:30,940
Scott: rolling America is real simple the way it works.

769
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,838
Scott: You roll some roll dice, right?

770
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:36,260
Scott: And then you have to put the numbers onto your map of America in these states.

771
00:46:36,561 --> 00:46:40,420
Rym: But then the numbers like one through six can't be more than one away from all it.

772
00:46:40,581 --> 00:46:48,280
Scott: So if I put five in Florida and if I put a four in Georgia I'm good because they're two adjacent states and their numbers are one apart from each other.

773
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:52,760
Scott: But guess what Florida is also adjacent to what Alabama next to it, right?

774
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,653
Scott: And it's like well, what if I get a I have to put a two and out?

775
00:46:55,693 --> 00:46:57,883
Scott: if I put a three in Alabama That's good.

776
00:46:57,923 --> 00:47:01,195
Scott: It's one away from Georgia, but it's two away from Florida.

777
00:47:01,216 --> 00:47:02,219
Scott: That's not good.

778
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:11,975
Rym: So another common element of these games then and this is what really makes these John those genres start to shine is Usually they'll give all the players a limited number of special powers.

779
00:47:12,015 --> 00:47:13,240
Rym: They can use that their discretion.

780
00:47:14,086 --> 00:47:22,842
Rym: so things like skip this role or Do this one twice or change a number or change a cut like something they can use a limited number of times a wildcard of Some kind right.

781
00:47:23,022 --> 00:47:29,118
Rym: so which together with the rolling gives a very nice and distinct element of push your luck.

782
00:47:29,298 --> 00:47:31,609
Scott: a good example This we played railroad Inc.

783
00:47:32,111 --> 00:47:32,795
Scott: I nk.

784
00:47:32,855 --> 00:47:33,740
Rym: I like that one a lot.

785
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:36,912
Rym: We played it at PAX West West.

786
00:47:37,112 --> 00:47:38,819
Scott: there's red and blue versions that was in first.

787
00:47:38,839 --> 00:47:43,651
Scott: look Yeah, they're mostly the same game but there's red and blue versions that are slightly different and the way it works is this dice.

788
00:47:44,013 --> 00:47:50,863
Scott: the dice have pictures on them of roads railroad tracks and Tunnels.

789
00:47:51,226 --> 00:47:55,512
Scott: Yeah, all these sort of like, you know the transportation lines that you would draw like

790
00:47:55,553 --> 00:47:56,920
Rym: SimCity looking transportation

791
00:47:57,101 --> 00:48:07,488
Scott: Right and you the dice get rolled and everyone has a little dry erase grid and you have to put those Pictures onto your thing and make a network of Interconnecting roads and rails.

792
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:09,240
Scott: and you don't want to leave dead ends.

793
00:48:09,502 --> 00:48:11,399
Scott: You want things to connect to the edge of the board?

794
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,898
Scott: You want to make you know a long road you want to.

795
00:48:13,958 --> 00:48:17,130
Scott: you know You want to arrange them in a way that scores the most points.

796
00:48:17,612 --> 00:48:21,591
Scott: and then there's like like Rym was saying this certain of like Get out of jail free make it.

797
00:48:21,611 --> 00:48:22,800
Scott: you're allowed to make a few mistakes.

798
00:48:23,201 --> 00:48:27,480
Scott: There's like a few dice you can better to sort of freebies you can use like once per game.

799
00:48:27,842 --> 00:48:28,404
Scott: You can ignore.

800
00:48:28,424 --> 00:48:30,635
Scott: you don't have to place every dice every time like you know.

801
00:48:30,715 --> 00:48:32,957
Scott: ignore some Right the stuff like that.

802
00:48:33,301 --> 00:48:33,602
Scott: So you don't.

803
00:48:33,722 --> 00:48:40,188
Scott: if you're not like locked in everyone can approach the game really differently and with the same dice You're like four or five players.

804
00:48:40,530 --> 00:48:41,897
Scott: Everyone's boards are completely different.

805
00:48:41,937 --> 00:48:51,219
Rym: Yep So the push your luck element the like risk/reward element, like I'm not doing well I'm going to take bigger risk Like there's a lot of things that make these games good.

806
00:48:51,802 --> 00:48:59,436
Rym: But if you're like are a game designer and you want to like make some basic games and like try to design games This is a really good genre to try.

807
00:48:59,456 --> 00:49:04,580
Scott: actually I just remembered there was a roll and write that I played after Yahtzee, which is roll through the ages.

808
00:49:04,901 --> 00:49:06,607
Scott: Oh, yeah, roll through the ages.

809
00:49:06,647 --> 00:49:07,189
Scott: hate that game.

810
00:49:07,329 --> 00:49:08,413
Scott: It's basically Yahtzee.

811
00:49:08,674 --> 00:49:10,380
Scott: It's really just Yahtzee with a different theme.

812
00:49:10,661 --> 00:49:12,367
Scott: Yeah, it was like nothing about it.

813
00:49:12,448 --> 00:49:15,500
Scott: that like was anything like the modern roll and writes.

814
00:49:16,062 --> 00:49:17,550
Scott: But if you come I didn't think of it.

815
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:23,420
Rym: if you come up with a good idea for something like this You can basically just make it with dice and dry erase stuff.

816
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,089
Scott: Yeah, roll and writes are just so simple to make.

817
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:29,400
Scott: there's actually there's a bunch of it's like text adventures, right?

818
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:36,022
Scott: There's like communities of people just cranking out roll and writes and the fun part is usually the theme of the sheet of paper that They make.

819
00:49:36,443 --> 00:49:37,407
Scott: yeah, right?

820
00:49:37,507 --> 00:49:43,556
Scott: It's like, you know, Ganshan clever is just like numbers on a board But a lot of the ones I see is like Halloween.

821
00:49:43,596 --> 00:49:51,460
Scott: roll and write You know, it's like, you know, what I you know anime roll and rise, you know, you know would you go up?

822
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:53,600
Scott: I'll put my six in my Super Saiyan area.

823
00:49:53,740 --> 00:50:05,680
Rym: But the other thing about these is that just by their nature both physical and design wise they're really good to Bust out if you got like a weird number of people while you're waiting to start a bigger game a different game.

824
00:50:05,941 --> 00:50:07,646
Rym: They're great to bust out at restaurants.

825
00:50:07,826 --> 00:50:10,213
Rym: They're great to bust out in lines at conventions.

826
00:50:10,233 --> 00:50:12,420
Scott: They're accessible to almost anybody.

827
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:18,500
Scott: Right because it's sort of like, you know, it's the kind of thing you could just get one on your phone, you know I don't have it actually searched.

828
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:22,575
Scott: I probably should for some phone apps of rolling rights because I can sit there and it's just.

829
00:50:22,615 --> 00:50:23,800
Scott: you're just solving this puzzle.

830
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:34,520
Scott: All right, it's like as opposed to a puzzle that you would normally solve where it's like, okay, you know There's one correct solution find it you have all the time in the world.

831
00:50:34,681 --> 00:50:34,962
Scott: It's like.

832
00:50:35,022 --> 00:50:40,140
Scott: no the inputs come in a certain order and you can only see what one input at a time without knowing the future.

833
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,309
Scott: Inputs, but they're also eyes it that way.

834
00:50:42,449 --> 00:50:45,060
Rym: they're not random in the sense of oh you just rolled double sixes.

835
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:45,943
Rym: That's why you won.

836
00:50:46,124 --> 00:50:50,940
Rym: It's you made the optimal decisions based on the inputs that we all shared.

837
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:53,913
Rym: Yep, so check these games out.

838
00:50:54,014 --> 00:51:03,180
Rym: This is going to be a Fast growing and I think very popular sector of tabletop and I think it's already a fast growing and popular section of tabletop.

839
00:51:03,361 --> 00:51:08,600
Scott: It's like and I don't think it's Reese's Peak yet, but I think it will level off, but I don't think it'll go away.

840
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:10,027
Scott: I think this will be like a constant.

841
00:51:10,288 --> 00:51:12,520
Scott: There'll always be a few rolling rights hanging out.

842
00:51:13,322 --> 00:51:14,560
Scott: There's always some text adventures.

843
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:20,360
Rym: I think it's gonna level off and then there's good as like someone's gonna come up with a clever twist on the genre.

844
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:24,433
Scott: There are already tons of clever twists exactly.

845
00:51:24,473 --> 00:51:26,460
Rym: I think people will keep coming up with clever twists.

846
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:31,327
Scott: Yeah the one that's one that's hot right now that I played is called welcome to where you have to.

847
00:51:31,347 --> 00:51:40,740
Scott: you have like this town and you're like Putting things into houses and the sheet of paper that you fill out looks really nice and it's like there's certain score bonuses for like.

848
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:47,608
Scott: You know the houses with the pools and you draw fences between the houses and you want to make groups Of houses that are like together.

849
00:51:47,688 --> 00:51:48,612
Scott: nicely, right?

850
00:51:48,733 --> 00:51:54,080
Scott: Yeah, it wasn't bad But I don't think it was as fun as some of the other ones but it's really popular right now.

851
00:51:54,181 --> 00:51:54,999
Scott: People are way into it.

852
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:56,386
Rym: But think about the kind of things you could do.

853
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:57,170
Rym: you could play a game.

854
00:51:57,210 --> 00:52:01,519
Rym: you can have a game like this where there's a Shared space multiple people are writing on.

855
00:52:01,769 --> 00:52:08,350
Rym: Yep You could do something like between two cities where like you and me Share a board and then me and the person in my right share a board.

856
00:52:08,571 --> 00:52:11,892
Rym: there are the possibilities of this tiny Between two rules.

857
00:52:12,196 --> 00:52:17,733
Rym: Yeah Though I think this is a space that you should watch closely and play these games.

858
00:52:18,475 --> 00:52:18,916
Scott: I make some.

859
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:20,020
Rym: yeah, I'll make one.

860
00:52:26,274 --> 00:52:28,810
