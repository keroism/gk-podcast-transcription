1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,843
Rym: It's Thursday March 9th, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:12,943 --> 00:00:19,664
Rym: We talk about how not to suck at life Specifically how to deal with dangerous awkward and otherwise odd situations.

3
00:00:20,326 --> 00:00:21,350
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:24,750
Scott: So today I get to work around 9 around usual time.

5
00:00:25,031 --> 00:00:28,630
Rym: Yeah, I actually rolled in around 11 since I slept through my alarm.

6
00:00:29,155 --> 00:00:38,810
Scott: awesome, so Around 10, you know the phones start resetting which is what happens when they can't get an IP address because they're all vo IP phones.

7
00:00:39,981 --> 00:00:47,034
Scott: and since my computer is plugged into the phone, I lost my internet connection also and It didn't.

8
00:00:47,315 --> 00:00:52,610
Scott: usually it resets once and then it comes back online, you know Cuz sometimes a little hiccup and the phones are real sensitive.

9
00:00:52,871 --> 00:00:58,926
Scott: yeah, so it didn't come back on and the phones kept resetting and resetting and resetting.

10
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:11,566
Scott: so I used my cell phone, which is the only Communication device I had at all that would work and called my boss and I said Hey, can you go to the optimum online website and tell me the system status?

11
00:01:11,627 --> 00:01:13,894
Scott: and he says There's a major outage.

12
00:01:13,914 --> 00:01:18,189
Scott: go home and I'm like, I drove an hour to get here and I've been here an hour.

13
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:21,022
Scott: Why why would I drive an hour to get home now?

14
00:01:21,585 --> 00:01:22,188
Scott: That's just silly.

15
00:01:23,271 --> 00:01:25,303
Rym: Well, it depends what if there was nothing out there to do.

16
00:01:25,424 --> 00:01:26,530
Rym: I just drive home immediately.

17
00:01:26,751 --> 00:01:29,565
Scott: Well, yeah, but my parents house is like 30 minutes away.

18
00:01:29,866 --> 00:01:30,449
Scott: So I went there.

19
00:01:30,951 --> 00:01:32,979
Scott: I didn't figure you know, I called my mom and she was home.

20
00:01:33,019 --> 00:01:34,284
Scott: So hey, why not?

21
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:39,340
Rym: Hey, you should have gone to Stu Leonard's Maybe yeah on the way home.

22
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:39,702
Scott: Yeah.

23
00:01:39,722 --> 00:01:40,867
Rym: Yeah, we still have croutons though.

24
00:01:40,908 --> 00:01:41,330
Rym: It's all good.

25
00:01:41,471 --> 00:01:41,933
Scott: Yeah, I went to.

26
00:01:41,974 --> 00:01:44,530
Scott: I went to stop and shop and I got some good food there.

27
00:01:44,851 --> 00:01:47,203
Scott: we'll see if it you know tastes good some I try.

28
00:01:47,223 --> 00:01:52,390
Scott: got some new things there and You know, so that story didn't go anywhere.

29
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:57,194
Scott: You know stuff The internet.

30
00:01:57,234 --> 00:01:58,701
Scott: well, here's the end of the story.

31
00:01:58,721 --> 00:02:03,044
Scott: I got an email that says yeah The Internet's not gonna be up there tomorrow either.

32
00:02:03,064 --> 00:02:03,990
Scott: don't go to work tomorrow.

33
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,758
Scott: So I might finish that theme tomorrow everybody.

34
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,583
Rym: Hey, at least they warned you.

35
00:02:09,044 --> 00:02:09,204
Scott: Yep.

36
00:02:09,626 --> 00:02:10,328
Rym: Yeah this weekend.

37
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:11,190
Rym: We're doing a bunch of stuff.

38
00:02:11,271 --> 00:02:20,650
Scott: We're gonna do the theme Hopefully we're gonna do a Libsyn hopefully Awesome gonna gonna get all that crap done for all you people's and for us people's.

39
00:02:21,632 --> 00:02:23,449
Scott: Maybe I'll rearrange the furniture in my room also.

40
00:02:24,731 --> 00:02:27,021
Rym: Yeah, I'm sure they all just care about that.

41
00:02:27,383 --> 00:02:37,755
Rym: Yeah, so in the news IBM now they've been doing a lot of arts outsourcing and a lot of companies been outsourcing mostly to India but also to Vietnam and Russia in various places.

42
00:02:38,417 --> 00:02:44,593
Rym: now IBM is doing something that hasn't been done often and they're doing it very Much.

43
00:02:44,693 --> 00:02:48,770
Rym: so they're outsourcing high-level jobs as opposed to low-level jobs.

44
00:02:49,693 --> 00:03:00,068
Rym: so normally when you hear about outsourcing you think you know, all right, they're outsourcing tech support or Phone calls like phone data centers or whatever or maybe chip manufacturing.

45
00:03:00,469 --> 00:03:04,650
Rym: now They're outsourcing actual solutions development to Bangalore, India.

46
00:03:05,832 --> 00:03:06,214
Scott: All right.

47
00:03:06,295 --> 00:03:07,722
Scott: Well those Indian people are smart.

48
00:03:07,742 --> 00:03:09,110
Scott: They know what they're doing kind exactly.

49
00:03:09,351 --> 00:03:09,933
Rym: That's the thing.

50
00:03:09,953 --> 00:03:16,098
Rym: a lot of people in this country seem to be very unafraid of outsourcing because they say Oh, no one can do the job.

51
00:03:16,178 --> 00:03:16,520
Rym: I do.

52
00:03:16,661 --> 00:03:17,284
Rym: Haha.

53
00:03:17,424 --> 00:03:21,355
Rym: I'm a smart American and Now that's really not the case.

54
00:03:21,395 --> 00:03:26,250
Scott: you're not special and those other people are smarter and they'll be willing to get paid less.

55
00:03:26,733 --> 00:03:27,942
Rym: They're also more determined.

56
00:03:28,305 --> 00:03:39,207
Scott: Yeah, so Your choices are pretty much beat them in terms of how much you're willing to be paid and you know your quality of life and such or Be unemployed when they take your job.

57
00:03:40,351 --> 00:03:47,554
Rym: See, I'm very glad that I'm in IT because the part of the stuff I do is actually very difficult to outsource because I physically Do things.

58
00:03:48,117 --> 00:03:50,430
Scott: Yeah, I don't seem to have problems getting a job either.

59
00:03:50,691 --> 00:03:55,550
Rym: Oh, yeah, honestly, I got three job offers in the past week and all of them are very enticing.

60
00:03:56,013 --> 00:04:03,112
Scott: Yeah, when I had my resume up, I got a whole bunch, you know It's just a lot of them were kind of like I didn't want to do them as opposed to they didn't want me You know.

61
00:04:03,654 --> 00:04:06,826
Scott: and then I finally picked one and I got it and maybe a little while from now.

62
00:04:06,906 --> 00:04:07,750
Scott: I'll go find another one.

63
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:12,922
Rym: Yeah but IBM already has almost 40,000 workers in India and they're going to be expanding that greatly.

64
00:04:12,942 --> 00:04:17,329
Rym: and I find it interesting that they claim They're not gonna fire anyone over this.

65
00:04:17,731 --> 00:04:22,810
Rym: They're gonna you know business speak realign their watch hits and inward-facing blah blah blah.

66
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:31,153
Rym: But they're gonna repurpose all of the facilities that otherwise would be closed down that used to do what they're shipping off to India Mm-hmm.

67
00:04:31,334 --> 00:04:32,678
Rym: I wonder how long that'll last.

68
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:38,730
Scott: Yeah, then there'll be this layoff that's completely unrelated to those Outsources, but that'll be at least years down the road.

69
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:44,910
Rym: I do know that IBM despite all of its problems is very good about when when something's gonna be shut down.

70
00:04:45,312 --> 00:04:48,210
Rym: They give everyone who works for them time to at least find other jobs.

71
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:53,910
Scott: Oh, yeah, and if you can't find another job, then you probably deserve to be laid off anyway, because you're worthless.

72
00:04:54,211 --> 00:05:00,936
Rym: Yeah, I mean I used to think that the IT industry was really in a lot in a rut, but not so much I mean, I'm really not kidding.

73
00:05:00,976 --> 00:05:03,484
Rym: I've gotten not just like oh, let's interview this person.

74
00:05:03,524 --> 00:05:05,190
Rym: But hey, do you want a job?

75
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:14,598
Rym: many of them like people call me constantly now because I put my resume up online a few weeks ago and they just keep offering me more and For various jobs all over the place.

76
00:05:14,618 --> 00:05:16,927
Scott: because I think what happened is in the in the early 90s.

77
00:05:16,947 --> 00:05:31,568
Scott: there they when there was an explosion there was almost on this huge demand for I information in IT and CS workers and such and They fulfilled that demand by hiring, you know people who are like high school kids and stuff and everything.

78
00:05:31,588 --> 00:05:32,090
Scott: It was crazy.

79
00:05:32,272 --> 00:05:38,629
Rym: Yeah, I mean when we were in high school You could get a job making web pages if you knew basic HTML and they'd pay you 10 20 bucks an hour.

80
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:40,658
Scott: Yeah, those are crazy times.

81
00:05:40,739 --> 00:05:49,010
Rym: yeah for any of you who missed the dot-com boom It was a an awesome time to be alive and I'm glad that I was not in the industry when it crashed.

82
00:05:49,352 --> 00:06:00,949
Scott: I am also glad anyway, but after that, you know it's like all of a sudden all these people who are CS and IT majors started graduating from school and people started taking CS and IT as as their major because there was big money in it.

83
00:06:01,351 --> 00:06:04,561
Scott: So now there's company and then yeah, and then all the companies met a business.

84
00:06:04,702 --> 00:06:07,170
Scott: So the demand decreased and the supply increased.

85
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:16,910
Scott: But now We have this Increasing demand still for real IT and CS jobs and not companies that are gonna disappear tomorrow.

86
00:06:17,162 --> 00:06:23,045
Rym: Yeah and there's a lot of companies that have people already who don't really have the skills the company needs.

87
00:06:23,226 --> 00:06:30,048
Scott: and all those IT and CS Graduates that you know took it for the money aren't really smart and they don't really know what they're doing.

88
00:06:30,329 --> 00:06:35,626
Rym: granted I took it just for the money, but this stuff isn't that complicated if you actually paid attention at all.

89
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:38,940
Scott: Yeah, and You know, it was like in CS.

90
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,930
Scott: You could always tell the people who knew it was going on.

91
00:06:41,071 --> 00:06:42,469
Scott: It was like two levels of programmers.

92
00:06:42,991 --> 00:06:49,810
Scott: There are people who did the CS work as work and they didn't care about computers or CS at all outside of their schoolwork.

93
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:51,695
Scott: Those people didn't really make it.

94
00:06:51,736 --> 00:06:52,739
Scott: they got lame jobs.

95
00:06:53,240 --> 00:07:01,670
Scott: the people who code and you know coded before they got to school Coded things in their spare time and continued to code their own things after graduating.

96
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:04,129
Scott: Those are the people that are worth something like me.

97
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:10,230
Rym: Yeah, IT is much broader because the skill base is very varied and it really depends on where you're working and what you're doing.

98
00:07:10,391 --> 00:07:12,129
Scott: Well, this is a very varied skill base for CS.

99
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:25,223
Rym: oh, yeah, but yeah IT is very different from CS in that really people skills and just being generally smart matter a lot more than Knowing about specific tech because anytime you change jobs Every company uses a completely different tech.

100
00:07:25,263 --> 00:07:26,430
Rym: You're gonna have to learn it all over again.

101
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:32,196
Rym: Anyway, but as long as you know the base like the like if you know TCP IP you can deal with whatever crap They throw at you.

102
00:07:32,277 --> 00:07:33,509
Rym: networking wise, you know.

103
00:07:34,611 --> 00:07:35,836
Scott: Yes, CS is sort of the same way.

104
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:39,230
Scott: if you know object-oriented programming you can do whatever language they want.

105
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:47,469
Scott: The thing is people always people don't know how to hire CS people, you know That's one thing that Joel on software always writes about is how to hire programmers.

106
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:59,590
Rym: now actually, there seems to be a very large market growing in companies or people who know how to hire people and they offer their services to Companies to find them people so the HR people don't hire someone stupid.

107
00:07:59,991 --> 00:08:09,167
Scott: The thing is is that those people themselves are good workers that are now getting paid to Essentially not do work that they should be hired to do and that you know, that's fine.

108
00:08:09,187 --> 00:08:24,850
Rym: I Mean the thing is it's all well and good to care about your job but I work mostly because they pay me and I use the fact that I am paid to Fund all of my other fun things like podcasting or anime conventions or real life.

109
00:08:25,153 --> 00:08:26,869
Scott: Yeah, I work for the money.

110
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:37,809
Rym: But also I would not do a job if it was not if it was extremely painful to do Well, yeah, I mean being stung by bees in the eye that that's not the most fun job and it is rather painful.

111
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:40,850
Scott: I meant like, you know a job I didn't like.

112
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,621
Rym: I've liked almost no job I've ever had like.

113
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:51,257
Scott: if they paid me my current salary Even if they paid me double my current salary if my job was like filing papers in a cubicle or something If someone paid wouldn't do it.

114
00:08:51,338 --> 00:08:57,546
Rym: if someone paid me double my current salary I'd do whatever they asked and then I just quit after a few years with a pile of money.

115
00:08:57,566 --> 00:08:59,051
Scott: No, I wouldn't do it It would have.

116
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:01,622
Scott: it's not worth my time to do something.

117
00:09:01,662 --> 00:09:03,007
Scott: That's so unpleasant.

118
00:09:03,047 --> 00:09:09,890
Scott: No matter what I'm paid Well, not no matter what I'm paid They could pay me so much that I would only have to do it for like a week or two and then I could quit.

119
00:09:10,151 --> 00:09:12,382
Rym: no, no your example double your salary.

120
00:09:12,482 --> 00:09:18,224
Rym: if I was making six figures and All I had to do was file papers, that's great.

121
00:09:18,285 --> 00:09:19,110
Rym: I do it for two years.

122
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,500
Rym: I have a giant pile of money.

123
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:21,770
Rym: I'd quit and I'd go do something fun.

124
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:31,949
Scott: No, cuz if I was getting paid six figures and I was filing papers after like a month I would just want to kill myself and it wouldn't be worth the money.

125
00:09:32,451 --> 00:09:35,783
Scott: Just that the immense pain of filing papers all day every day.

126
00:09:35,863 --> 00:09:37,288
Rym: See I don't find it painful to me.

127
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,538
Rym: the eight hours I spend at work is lost no matter what.

128
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,165
Rym: so I really don't care what I'm doing.

129
00:09:41,266 --> 00:09:48,001
Rym: if I work for a company They're buying my time and I will give them my time and I'll do whatever they ask Me of me in that time.

130
00:09:48,022 --> 00:09:51,310
Rym: and other than that I really don't care so that time's not lost to me.

131
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:56,370
Scott: My entire goal in life is to get back as much of that time as possible while still getting enough money.

132
00:09:56,752 --> 00:09:59,189
Rym: Yeah, the best way to get that back is to become rich and not have to work.

133
00:09:59,671 --> 00:10:02,923
Scott: Well, there's one way but the other way is to do work.

134
00:10:02,983 --> 00:10:04,327
Scott: That isn't a loss of time.

135
00:10:04,348 --> 00:10:09,110
Rym: Yeah Well, I don't think I could ever have a job in technology that I wouldn't consider a loss of time.

136
00:10:09,892 --> 00:10:10,635
Scott: I think I could.

137
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,119
Rym: yeah, well coding is very different.

138
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:12,420
Rym: coding.

139
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,243
Rym: you create things.

140
00:10:13,664 --> 00:10:14,026
Rym: IT.

141
00:10:14,066 --> 00:10:15,270
Rym: you maintain things.

142
00:10:16,013 --> 00:10:18,022
Scott: I maintain things that are already created.

143
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:19,630
Rym: Yeah, you also create new things.

144
00:10:19,891 --> 00:10:22,261
Rym: I don't create anything other than maybe a bash script here or there.

145
00:10:22,642 --> 00:10:24,490
Rym: Anyway, we've gone off on a long tangent.

146
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,444
Rym: The point is IBM is outsourcing.

147
00:10:26,464 --> 00:10:27,350
Rym: This is even technology.

148
00:10:27,471 --> 00:10:37,338
Rym: This is like solutions development stuff But high-level work that they're just outsourcing to India because there's no reason to keep it here in the u.s suck For some people.

149
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:37,881
Rym: Yep.

150
00:10:38,082 --> 00:10:39,250
Scott: Hooray for some other people.

151
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,590
Rym: Globalism Actually.

152
00:10:44,851 --> 00:10:50,995
Scott: President Bush had a recent comment about outsourcing that was actually Uncharacteristically intelligent.

153
00:10:51,136 --> 00:10:53,650
Rym: Yeah, his speechwriter must have gotten a raise or something.

154
00:10:54,051 --> 00:10:54,935
Scott: Yeah, what he said?

155
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:59,170
Scott: he was talking about outsourcing to India and he said yeah, it's a natural economic thing.

156
00:10:59,210 --> 00:10:59,853
Scott: It's gonna happen.

157
00:10:59,874 --> 00:11:00,718
Scott: What are you gonna do about it?

158
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,627
Scott: All right, whatever you think about that.

159
00:11:02,648 --> 00:11:03,070
Scott: I don't care.

160
00:11:03,473 --> 00:11:11,230
Scott: The next thing he said was you know Maybe you American people should think about making things to sell to all those middle-class people in India.

161
00:11:12,193 --> 00:11:17,078
Rym: And I was like, yeah, maybe we should Except no one wants to make anything here.

162
00:11:17,158 --> 00:11:19,125
Rym: No one wants a factory in their account in their town.

163
00:11:19,848 --> 00:11:22,835
Scott: Ah Just cuz you don't want one.

164
00:11:23,136 --> 00:11:26,587
Scott: at least Bush is at least willing to say it's not anything you need it.

165
00:11:27,049 --> 00:11:29,810
Rym: honestly I don't think he really paid attention to what he was saying.

166
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:33,549
Rym: I'm pretty sure that was a speech writer and some AIDS could be but he did say it.

167
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,636
Scott: Whether he meant it or knew it or not.

168
00:11:35,676 --> 00:11:36,259
Scott: It doesn't matter.

169
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:38,468
Scott: Yeah, he said it so we'll go by it.

170
00:11:39,451 --> 00:11:53,840
Scott: All right, so in the other news Hillary Clinton our senator and Joe Lieberman my former senator not the greatest senators in the world, but not the worst but whatever I don't consider very many senators at all to be anywhere near great.

171
00:11:54,201 --> 00:11:55,544
Scott: Yeah, Obama's good.

172
00:11:55,564 --> 00:11:56,607
Rym: Yeah, he's.

173
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:59,506
Rym: even though he's not great He's good, but he hasn't done anything amazing.

174
00:11:59,687 --> 00:12:09,109
Scott: Nope anyway, these two people have been notorious for anti video gaming actions and Just today they passed a bill.

175
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,014
Scott: they didn't pass the bill into law.

176
00:12:11,054 --> 00:12:19,720
Scott: they passed it out of the committee into the Senate and it is the Children and Media Research Advancement Act the camera.

177
00:12:20,722 --> 00:12:21,710
Rym: Now isn't this the law?

178
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,020
Rym: that's just supposed to put money.

179
00:12:23,161 --> 00:12:25,999
Rym: So the CDC will investigate the effects of games on kids.

180
00:12:26,361 --> 00:12:27,645
Scott: That is the major.

181
00:12:28,006 --> 00:12:35,399
Scott: the law does a lot of things but the number one thing it does is the Center for Disease Control And Prevention is going to do a major study.

182
00:12:36,361 --> 00:12:37,330
Scott: basically, they're paid.

183
00:12:37,371 --> 00:12:46,340
Scott: they agreed to Give them 90 million dollars to create evidence that shows that video games make violence and such and such as that.

184
00:12:46,982 --> 00:12:51,738
Rym: Now the thing is if they actually do science these studies could show that video games don't do anything.

185
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:57,040
Scott: Yep And the problem is will they do science or will they just do basically?

186
00:12:57,641 --> 00:13:00,420
Scott: What you know happens when Microsoft pays someone to do a study?

187
00:13:01,282 --> 00:13:02,489
Scott: Microsoft the answer they want.

188
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:07,013
Rym: Lieberman is very Devoted to this cause Hillary.

189
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:18,160
Rym: However, I Really think that the only reason she even is ever anywhere near this issue is simply because it gives her a way to look Good in front of various soccer bomb types or other conservatives

190
00:13:19,322 --> 00:13:21,941
Scott: Maybe who knows we don't know them But

191
00:13:22,262 --> 00:13:26,320
Rym: because most of her other ideas and policies are generally very good and well

192
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,120
Scott: Most of Joe Lieberman's other ideas are generally very good.

193
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,829
Scott: I'd say he's about 80% good.

194
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:36,770
Scott: Yeah, so, you know It's just I can't tell and there's no way to know.

195
00:13:36,891 --> 00:13:39,700
Scott: but maybe we should go ask the CDC what they're gonna do.

196
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,830
Scott: And why is it the CDC that's doing this study?

197
00:13:41,911 --> 00:13:43,680
Rym: because that the Centers for Disease Control.

198
00:13:43,861 --> 00:13:48,140
Rym: One of the main things they do is they research possible threats to the health and well-being of Americans.

199
00:13:48,981 --> 00:13:56,590
Scott: Yeah, but I don't know if this really falls into a disease category, but if it has Physiological or psychological effects that it definitely does.

200
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:00,907
Scott: Well, it says here that the advocacy group Citizens against the government waste.

201
00:14:01,329 --> 00:14:01,911
Scott: I'm for that.

202
00:14:01,931 --> 00:14:03,478
Scott: I am against government waste.

203
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:07,713
Rym: careful The way the government works is that any time there's something named something and me it it's.

204
00:14:07,894 --> 00:14:09,660
Rym: it's actually rooting for the exact opposite.

205
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:14,199
Scott: You mean how the Constitution Party wants to destroy the Constitution or how the Federalist Party was?

206
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,308
Rym: Anti-federalist and the anti-federalists were actually federalists.

207
00:14:17,468 --> 00:14:17,689
Scott: Yep.

208
00:14:17,889 --> 00:14:32,559
Scott: Anyway, they deemed Lieberman the porker of the month Criticizing him for spending taxpayer money on redundant studies already undertaken by groups like the Kaiser Family Foundation And the American Academy of Pediatrics, huh?

209
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:49,359
Scott: so, you know knowing that that lends a little bit more credence to the point that This study is them trying to buy a study that gives them the result they want as opposed to a study that desperately needs To be done because it's already being done.

210
00:14:49,886 --> 00:14:58,572
Rym: It's probably a lot like the Porn stuff that the government's doing been doing lately against Google where they want to subpoena all their search results So they can see how much porn is out there perhaps.

211
00:14:58,593 --> 00:15:00,940
Scott: I Just don't like the whole thing.

212
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:03,099
Scott: The government really shouldn't you know?

213
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:08,700
Scott: Because the simple fact is they shouldn't be legislating it no matter what the result of the study is because of freedom of speech.

214
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:11,680
Scott: Therefore they shouldn't be doing the study in the first place.

215
00:15:12,135 --> 00:15:22,180
Rym: well No I If they were actual science if they if the government was just paying scientists to study various things I'd be all for a study because it would add to the general knowledge base of the human race.

216
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:24,890
Scott: Yeah, but they're not doing it, you know to be a study.

217
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,777
Scott: They're trying to manufacture evidence.

218
00:15:26,877 --> 00:15:27,700
Rym: See that's the problem.

219
00:15:28,043 --> 00:15:29,559
Rym: The government should be paying for research.

220
00:15:29,901 --> 00:15:33,420
Rym: The government should be shouldn't be paying scientists to make up the research for them.

221
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:37,760
Scott: And also if the government is gonna pay for research, they should not do so much redundant research.

222
00:15:37,861 --> 00:15:41,037
Scott: They should go for you know, something something better to be studying than this.

223
00:15:41,157 --> 00:15:41,660
Scott: That's not good.

224
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,814
Rym: Well, that's just because it gets decided by committee instead of by scientists.

225
00:15:44,975 --> 00:15:45,960
Scott: Yeah, I know that's the problem.

226
00:15:53,113 --> 00:16:04,910
Rym: So we've been wanting a griddle in our kitchen for a long time Mostly because we watch the hibachi guy use his giant Hot metal plate to make awesome hibachi food for us and we can't really do it in our kitchen.

227
00:16:05,311 --> 00:16:15,498
Scott: I know it's like all the easy and great foods that we could cook quickly that would taste great for dinner require a hot Very hot very flat piece of metal.

228
00:16:15,538 --> 00:16:18,206
Scott: and we have these coily electric things.

229
00:16:18,266 --> 00:16:18,787
Scott: and it's not.

230
00:16:19,108 --> 00:16:19,670
Scott: it's not so good.

231
00:16:19,831 --> 00:16:21,950
Rym: Yeah, the heats not that even not only that but even breakfast.

232
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:32,130
Rym: You know making pancakes on something like that is so much easier than using some sort of pan Yep, but anyway, there's a company out there that is just marketed and made a anti griddle.

233
00:16:32,932 --> 00:16:35,800
Rym: It's a griddle but instead of heating it freezes.

234
00:16:36,321 --> 00:16:39,028
Rym: it gets down to negative 30 degrees Fahrenheit.

235
00:16:39,048 --> 00:16:40,519
Scott: That's cold Fahrenheit.

236
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:41,548
Rym: that's like negative woman.

237
00:16:43,172 --> 00:16:44,738
Rym: That's like negative 34 Celsius.

238
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,249
Scott: Wow, you could like make ice cream on that or something.

239
00:16:48,113 --> 00:16:53,389
Rym: Yeah, the main uses they seem to talk about are say you make some sort of creamy You know pudding type thing.

240
00:16:53,932 --> 00:17:01,658
Rym: You can put it on this thing shape it into a shape and then take it off right away and it'll be frozen and crunchy On the outside, but cool and creamy on the inside.

241
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:06,829
Scott: I see these being utilized heavily in the next pastry championship.

242
00:17:08,692 --> 00:17:14,996
Rym: I just hope we see more of these around because I got to say I like the Cold Stone Creamery a lot and there Aren't any around here.

243
00:17:15,016 --> 00:17:20,133
Scott: Yeah, it's just ice cream to me, but you ever eaten at one It's ice cream.

244
00:17:20,153 --> 00:17:22,643
Rym: Yeah, it's ice cream like subway where you pick what you want in it.

245
00:17:23,366 --> 00:17:23,646
Scott: Yeah.

246
00:17:23,867 --> 00:17:26,557
Rym: Yeah Anyway, I think this is cool.

247
00:17:26,738 --> 00:17:29,050
Scott: I think it's cool, but I don't know how much we would actually use.

248
00:17:29,171 --> 00:17:29,940
Rym: Oh, we wouldn't use one.

249
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:30,344
Rym: It's like 800 bucks.

250
00:17:31,131 --> 00:17:31,855
Scott: I mean even it was.

251
00:17:32,016 --> 00:17:34,550
Scott: it was it as much as a George Foreman grill.

252
00:17:34,795 --> 00:17:35,549
Scott: How much would we use it?

253
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:39,790
Rym: The only reason we wouldn't is because we don't have the skill to make the things that would go on it in the first place.

254
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:40,474
Scott: There you go.

255
00:17:40,514 --> 00:17:41,419
Scott: It's like I have a blender.

256
00:17:41,439 --> 00:17:42,505
Scott: I barely use the blender.

257
00:17:42,545 --> 00:17:44,232
Scott: Maybe I should use it more Summer.

258
00:17:44,253 --> 00:17:45,156
Scott: I'll use it more in the summer.

259
00:17:45,176 --> 00:17:46,320
Rym: Let's make milkshakes every day.

260
00:17:46,822 --> 00:17:47,585
Scott: No, not every day.

261
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:48,067
Rym: Why not?

262
00:17:48,248 --> 00:17:48,810
Scott: We'll get fat.

263
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,378
Rym: No, you won't you anyway, I won't.

264
00:17:51,162 --> 00:17:52,790
Scott: so I found another thing on Craigslist.

265
00:17:53,011 --> 00:17:58,230
Scott: This is akin to the hey crackhead with the guy with the spark plugs getting stolen.

266
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:08,010
Scott: This is in the same category and oh my god I. our podcast isn't marked explicit, but this is like beyond explicit and alright, so and I'm gonna read it.

267
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:09,977
Rym: Yeah, the next few minutes are going to be explicit.

268
00:18:10,439 --> 00:18:11,423
Scott: So the introduction.

269
00:18:11,463 --> 00:18:12,246
Scott: Let me let me read this.

270
00:18:12,286 --> 00:18:18,145
Scott: It's from a social worker And the social worker is obviously having a hard time with terrible terrible people.

271
00:18:18,727 --> 00:18:19,470
Scott: And this is what he says.

272
00:18:19,711 --> 00:18:20,818
Scott: I don't even know it's a he or she.

273
00:18:21,523 --> 00:18:26,110
Scott: after years of idealism I finally decided I'm sick and fucking tired of helping the disenfranchised and oppressed.

274
00:18:26,432 --> 00:18:29,650
Scott: I have a master's degree in social work and I've worked in a number of different settings.

275
00:18:30,153 --> 00:18:37,126
Scott: I've been a social worker for Children's Protective Services a Therapist and a psych ward and I've worked as a case manager for a nonprofit.

276
00:18:37,146 --> 00:18:38,150
Scott: that shall remain nameless.

277
00:18:38,712 --> 00:18:44,507
Scott: I've had a number of clients over the years that I would now like to thank for helping me come to the realization that certain People are beyond help.

278
00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:52,638
Scott: He then goes on to describe six very specific Terrible terrible terrible people.

279
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,589
Rym: now, we don't need to read these on the air here.

280
00:18:56,132 --> 00:18:59,789
Scott: Well, let me give you a taste of just one of these six.

281
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:02,520
Rym: Yes, and if you're interested read the rest, these are.

282
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:04,267
Rym: this isn't as fun like the.

283
00:19:04,367 --> 00:19:06,837
Rym: the medical thread We talked about a while ago was hilarious.

284
00:19:07,219 --> 00:19:09,448
Rym: This is less hilarious and more horrifying.

285
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:13,224
Scott: Yeah So the crackhead mother with 27 cats.

286
00:19:13,606 --> 00:19:17,415
Scott: obviously she has Toxoplasmosis Exactly.

287
00:19:18,099 --> 00:19:20,050
Scott: I called you in advance to set up our appointment.

288
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:28,017
Scott: You knew I was going to be at your house that day and that I would be evaluating your progress and making your home Habitable so that your kids would be returned to you.

289
00:19:28,739 --> 00:19:29,261
Scott: So why?

290
00:19:29,281 --> 00:19:32,210
Scott: oh, why did you answer the door with a crack pipe in your hand?

291
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:40,104
Scott: Oh It's not yours you were just holding on to it for your neighbor.

292
00:19:40,566 --> 00:19:41,309
Scott: sure I'll buy that.

293
00:19:41,892 --> 00:19:43,017
Scott: Let me ask you something though.

294
00:19:43,478 --> 00:19:44,282
Scott: Are those your neighbors?

295
00:19:44,342 --> 00:19:46,190
Scott: cat turds overflowing in the kitchen sink?

296
00:19:47,372 --> 00:19:47,976
Scott: No, you're right.

297
00:19:48,057 --> 00:19:49,930
Scott: Those litter boxes are expensive.

298
00:19:50,472 --> 00:19:54,410
Scott: Perhaps you should consider getting rid of a few of the cats so there'll be room for your children.

299
00:19:55,052 --> 00:19:59,189
Scott: Just a thought by the way, is that your neighbor's blood coagulating over there on the couch?

300
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:09,698
Scott: God Yeah, so there's five more of those and at the end that he said, I don't know if it's a he still he says Okay, I feel much better now.

301
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,150
Scott: I think I might go back to school for an MBA or something.

302
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:16,143
Scott: I'm tired of working to help these people for 60 hours a week at 35,000 a year.

303
00:20:16,163 --> 00:20:22,466
Scott: I don't blame this guy But I don't know what to do about these people and it's really tough.

304
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:30,033
Rym: Yeah, maybe we'll do a show on it someday because we had a debate about this just before the show a debate where neither of Us knew what to do.

305
00:20:30,053 --> 00:20:43,515
Rym: Yeah, I mean we're very opinionated, but when it comes down to these types of people I mean, I guess these types of people sounds bad but the types of people that you'll read about if you read Scott's thing of the day, I don't know what to do.

306
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,515
Scott: it's like I'm against killing and I'm against.

307
00:20:47,937 --> 00:20:53,704
Scott: you know hurting them and Jail or rehab won't really fix them because they're just so.

308
00:20:53,904 --> 00:20:56,333
Scott: that's terrible terrible people There's not.

309
00:20:56,715 --> 00:21:03,586
Scott: you can't help them but at the same time you don't want to let them go on hurting society But you don't want to kill them because that's wrong.

310
00:21:03,606 --> 00:21:04,049
Scott: So what do you do?

311
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:07,419
Rym: Yeah, you can't exile them because that just hurts them and someone else now.

312
00:21:07,961 --> 00:21:09,144
Scott: Yeah, what is not?

313
00:21:09,245 --> 00:21:10,508
Scott: there's no right answer.

314
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:12,132
Scott: I mean You know.

315
00:21:12,293 --> 00:21:14,641
Scott: if you you can decide that killing is okay.

316
00:21:14,801 --> 00:21:16,888
Scott: if you somehow decide that I don't know how you could yeah.

317
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:19,546
Rym: And if you can watch try gun, it might change your mind a little.

318
00:21:19,808 --> 00:21:27,993
Scott: yeah But if you can't decide that you just kind of have to figure out what hurts society the least without being Evil.

319
00:21:28,615 --> 00:21:33,210
Rym: Yeah, so we'll do a show on that someday so you can hear all of our varied opinions about it.

320
00:21:33,713 --> 00:21:35,484
Scott: Yeah, but Wow, I don't know.

321
00:21:36,209 --> 00:21:41,989
Rym: Yeah So anyway today the final day of our first theme week how to not suck week?

322
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:45,959
Rym: Yeah, well we'll pick a better theme another time.

323
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:47,283
Scott: I know I had not to suck.

324
00:21:47,463 --> 00:21:49,510
Scott: don't put anything in your mouth and apply suction.

325
00:21:49,631 --> 00:21:54,130
Rym: Yeah, yeah Scott's been making that joke all week and he's been waiting for the opportunity to say it on the air.

326
00:21:54,231 --> 00:21:54,795
Rym: So there you go.

327
00:21:54,876 --> 00:21:55,340
Scott: There you go.

328
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,570
Scott: Yeah, it's obvious.

329
00:21:56,951 --> 00:22:03,290
Rym: So today we came up with a lot of ideas and a lot of them we wanted to save or we already done and we'd forgotten.

330
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:09,112
Scott: Yeah, can you imagine we haven't even done a hundred episodes and already we forgot some of the episodes We did.

331
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:18,661
Rym: I had to go search in our own archives to see if we had talked about money though I note that unlike slash dot we don't have dupes because we actually do search through search through our archives to make sure we haven't Done something already.

332
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:22,070
Scott: Yes Actually slash that hasn't had so many dupes lately.

333
00:22:22,531 --> 00:22:25,799
Scott: I think they've been improving because now dig is putting the pressure on.

334
00:22:26,059 --> 00:22:30,792
Rym: it is Though dig doesn't quite have the quality of comments yet No, but they have.

335
00:22:30,812 --> 00:22:34,658
Scott: this a comment system that a beginning to think is is challenging.

336
00:22:34,698 --> 00:22:35,940
Scott: slash that system pretty well.

337
00:22:37,311 --> 00:22:43,450
Rym: But anyway, anyway today we decided that we're going to do very simply how to not suck under pressure.

338
00:22:44,173 --> 00:22:54,691
Scott: What we're gonna do is we're gonna go through some situations that are pretty tough that most people would freak out in or mess up or do something stupid in and we're gonna tell you how not to do something Stupid.

339
00:22:55,213 --> 00:22:57,923
Rym: and then at the end we're gonna go through some generic advice on.

340
00:22:58,183 --> 00:23:00,050
Rym: you know, what did you learn from all these situations?

341
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:00,773
Rym: What did you learn?

342
00:23:01,114 --> 00:23:18,469
Rym: because basically both of us have been in a lot of very difficult dangerous or otherwise frightening situations and We've noticed that most people when confronted with a dangerous or unexpected situation I don't want to say don't deal with it properly, but just don't deal with it at all.

343
00:23:18,871 --> 00:23:23,790
Scott: Yeah, and it's not just you know, physically dangerous things like you're in a store and a guy comes in with a gun.

344
00:23:24,415 --> 00:23:36,088
Scott: It's like, you know emotional personal situations where someone's freaking out or you know People are in a fight or someone's really really mad or something, you know, something like that.

345
00:23:36,954 --> 00:23:38,330
Scott: Those actually happen more often.

346
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:47,669
Scott: It's much more useful advice to figure out how to deal with those than to deal with the rare occurrences Of crazy violence or a giant fire or something like that.

347
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:51,190
Rym: Alright, so let's start off with something real real light.

348
00:23:52,071 --> 00:23:53,316
Rym: Let's say you're at someone's house.

349
00:23:53,336 --> 00:23:56,448
Rym: You stand over and you accidentally break something.

350
00:23:57,691 --> 00:23:59,999
Scott: Well number one don't try to hide it.

351
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,162
Scott: admit you broke it.

352
00:24:01,403 --> 00:24:03,149
Rym: Yeah, don't be Peter from the family guy.

353
00:24:04,671 --> 00:24:10,430
Scott: If you broke it because it was if it was your fault that it broke like you bumped into something and it fell or whatever.

354
00:24:10,531 --> 00:24:16,683
Scott: Admit you did it Apologize and What's the word compensate?

355
00:24:17,147 --> 00:24:31,810
Rym: Yes Now we know specifically that many people don't do this because back when we lived in gotten colony and you know at RIT we had a bunch of eggs in our fridge and We had a bunch of friends over and then all the friends went home and we opened the fridge and all the eggs are broken.

356
00:24:32,452 --> 00:24:38,870
Rym: It looks like someone knocked it out of the fridge and there was egg matter on the ground outside the fridge and there's a big mess.

357
00:24:39,972 --> 00:24:41,544
Scott: Yeah, so we don't know who did it.

358
00:24:41,705 --> 00:24:43,557
Rym: we to this day We don't know and no one ever did it.

359
00:24:43,577 --> 00:24:49,390
Scott: to consider this if we found out who did it We would have freaking been pissed off at them and maybe hurt them or something.

360
00:24:49,872 --> 00:24:54,579
Scott: But if someone would have just said I broke the eggs and cleaned it up and threw them out Whatever we wouldn't care.

361
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:55,869
Scott: It's just two dollars worth of eggs.

362
00:24:56,452 --> 00:25:01,649
Scott: It's the hiding it and trying to be all sneaky that you know, we'll get the the heat put on you.

363
00:25:02,656 --> 00:25:05,049
Scott: so Don't try to be all sneaky.

364
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:09,909
Rym: Alright, let's say you're driving your car and someone hits your car.

365
00:25:11,274 --> 00:25:13,011
Scott: number one Stop.

366
00:25:13,753 --> 00:25:19,550
Rym: Yeah, someone actually hit my car when we were driving back from Otakon lab this previous year.

367
00:25:20,233 --> 00:25:20,575
Scott: Oh, yeah.

368
00:25:20,616 --> 00:25:20,978
Scott: Yeah.

369
00:25:21,018 --> 00:25:21,984
Rym: Yeah, I forgot about that.

370
00:25:22,005 --> 00:25:22,367
Rym: Didn't you?

371
00:25:22,407 --> 00:25:22,789
Scott: Yeah, I did.

372
00:25:23,112 --> 00:25:23,534
Rym: So we're in.

373
00:25:23,615 --> 00:25:24,601
Rym: I think we're still in Jersey.

374
00:25:24,621 --> 00:25:25,849
Scott: only his car was damaged.

375
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:37,170
Rym: Yeah So I. but basically we're on the freeway and now I-95 or any of you've ever driven on it And at the end of any weekend, especially in the summer It basically becomes an unmoving block of traffic.

376
00:25:38,612 --> 00:25:43,859
Rym: So we're driving on it and I'm going along, you know Maybe 45 50 because he can't go so fast.

377
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,410
Rym: and we come up over the crest of a hill and there's cars stopped ahead of us.

378
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:48,517
Rym: So I slow down and come to a stop.

379
00:25:49,322 --> 00:25:57,470
Rym: guy come up behind me Doesn't even seem to notice that the cars ahead of him hurt a dead Stop doesn't even slow down until he's about 10 feet away from the back of my car.

380
00:25:57,952 --> 00:26:00,843
Rym: I see him slam on the brakes cars skidding back and forth.

381
00:26:01,004 --> 00:26:02,350
Rym: He barely misses my car.

382
00:26:02,953 --> 00:26:06,130
Rym: He hits my rear-view mirror with side mirror.

383
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:11,246
Rym: Yeah with his side rear-view mirror his shatters in a shower of glass.

384
00:26:11,567 --> 00:26:12,530
Rym: Mine is undamaged.

385
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:14,690
Scott: Those things are expensive the side mirrors.

386
00:26:16,712 --> 00:26:18,137
Rym: So I roll down my window.

387
00:26:18,197 --> 00:26:26,019
Rym: cuz now he's basically sitting next to us since traffic isn't moving and I say hey Let's pull over, you know insurance blah.

388
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,522
Rym: and he flicks me off.

389
00:26:27,582 --> 00:26:30,449
Rym: Yells is your fault for stopping man and drives off like on the shoulder.

390
00:26:32,271 --> 00:26:32,988
Rym: Great yeah.

391
00:26:34,252 --> 00:26:38,078
Scott: so what you want to do is In a situation like that.

392
00:26:38,098 --> 00:26:40,070
Scott: There's not really much you can do because the guy's running away.

393
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:42,660
Scott: But write down his license plate and yes, which I did.

394
00:26:42,781 --> 00:26:44,970
Rym: and to call the police which I also did.

395
00:26:45,291 --> 00:26:51,165
Rym: Yeah, I never heard back what happened to him, but I filed a police report with the yeah It was New Jersey because that's where I filed the report.

396
00:26:51,448 --> 00:26:54,990
Scott: Yep Just you know, don't let it go if someone's that stupid now.

397
00:26:55,030 --> 00:27:02,476
Rym: Now this goes for crime in general because it seems that whenever like a crime is happening a lot of times Everyone thinks oh, it's not my responsibility.

398
00:27:02,617 --> 00:27:03,981
Rym: Uh, someone else will deal with it.

399
00:27:04,021 --> 00:27:05,586
Rym: Someone else already called 9-1-1.

400
00:27:05,867 --> 00:27:06,690
Rym: It's not my problem.

401
00:27:07,174 --> 00:27:13,344
Scott: Yeah, when I see you know something happening I call 9-1-1 even if I see people on the phone who are 99% probably calling 9-1-1.

402
00:27:15,292 --> 00:27:16,970
Rym: Yeah, like when we saw that horrible car fire.

403
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:25,542
Scott: Yeah We were driving down the highway and on the other side of the highway is this car and it was on fire Like like wow, it was a giant fireball.

404
00:27:25,582 --> 00:27:28,070
Rym: Like if anyone was inside that car they were dead totally dead.

405
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:29,257
Scott: There might have been dead people in it.

406
00:27:29,297 --> 00:27:29,720
Scott: We don't know.

407
00:27:29,821 --> 00:27:32,175
Rym: Yeah, cuz there was no one standing around it It was one person.

408
00:27:32,215 --> 00:27:33,422
Rym: Oh, yeah, there's that one guy like.

409
00:27:33,502 --> 00:27:36,624
Rym: it was a kind of fat guy in a white shirt But I don't even remember who it was.

410
00:27:36,664 --> 00:27:37,370
Scott: It was just a person.

411
00:27:37,571 --> 00:27:41,050
Rym: Yeah, but like there was no one else around and this car was engulfed in flames.

412
00:27:41,551 --> 00:27:45,723
Scott: It was like this giant window fire was coming out of every window and go.

413
00:27:45,743 --> 00:27:55,713
Scott: it was a giant pillar of black smoke going straight Up, I'm surprised maybe the gas tank had already exploded or was about to but we saw this the smoke pillar coming around the corner For mile.

414
00:27:55,753 --> 00:27:56,555
Rym: really we're driver like.

415
00:27:56,595 --> 00:27:57,458
Rym: what's that smoke?

416
00:27:57,939 --> 00:27:58,902
Rym: Yeah, what the hell's that?

417
00:27:59,143 --> 00:28:00,106
Rym: And finally we get there.

418
00:28:00,206 --> 00:28:01,430
Rym: Oh cars on fire.

419
00:28:01,715 --> 00:28:02,330
Scott: Yeah, it was crazy.

420
00:28:02,352 --> 00:28:08,750
Rym: No What was funny is that there was a cop like a half a mile back on the road pulling someone over for speeding.

421
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:09,676
Rym: You had no idea.

422
00:28:09,978 --> 00:28:11,730
Scott: Yeah, but I'm sure he found out pretty quick.

423
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:16,430
Rym: Yeah, so of course we called 9-1-1 and the 9-1-1 operator says wait a minute.

424
00:28:16,551 --> 00:28:18,059
Rym: Is it on blah blah blah and blah blah blah?

425
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:20,693
Rym: We're like, yeah, that sounds right and they said yeah We know about it.

426
00:28:21,336 --> 00:28:28,323
Rym: All right, but we called because a lot of times you'd be surprised How many times someone needs help and no one bothers to stop or call?

427
00:28:28,363 --> 00:28:29,607
Rym: They all assume someone else will do it.

428
00:28:30,149 --> 00:28:41,549
Rym: Mm-hmm There are even studies Farc had an article recently about it where they've shown that the more people are present at an accident or a dangerous situation The less likely it is that anyone will call for help.

429
00:28:42,392 --> 00:28:44,177
Scott: Yeah, because everyone thinks someone else did it.

430
00:28:44,518 --> 00:28:45,200
Rym: Yeah, so you know what.

431
00:28:45,581 --> 00:28:48,610
Rym: do it because you're that someone else to everyone else?

432
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:50,236
Scott: Yeah, do it no matter what.

433
00:28:50,377 --> 00:28:58,070
Scott: if there's anything that requires 9-1-1 ever Always call it even if someone is saying they called it already and you know.

434
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:03,878
Rym: If you're driving to work and you're the only other car on the road and you see an accident Don't just keep going.

435
00:29:04,341 --> 00:29:04,642
Rym: Stop.

436
00:29:04,702 --> 00:29:05,587
Rym: Make sure they're okay.

437
00:29:05,627 --> 00:29:06,270
Rym: Call the police.

438
00:29:06,451 --> 00:29:09,865
Scott: Yeah, if the police aren't there yet, you know, and you can do something about it.

439
00:29:09,986 --> 00:29:10,810
Scott: do something about it.

440
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:16,230
Scott: In fact at the very minimum keep driving but call 9-1-1 and say hey, I just passed an accident.

441
00:29:16,692 --> 00:29:18,258
Rym: In fact, some states have laws.

442
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:19,543
Rym: I don't know exactly which states.

443
00:29:20,025 --> 00:29:23,870
Rym: they're called Good Samaritan laws And some of these laws protect you if you try to help someone.

444
00:29:24,131 --> 00:29:27,890
Scott: Yeah, it's like if you try to help someone but you actually end up doing something bad.

445
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:30,270
Scott: It's okay because you were trying to do good.

446
00:29:30,431 --> 00:29:30,956
Scott: We're not gonna.

447
00:29:31,056 --> 00:29:32,529
Scott: you're not gonna get in trouble if you screw up.

448
00:29:32,954 --> 00:29:41,777
Rym: but some of these other laws State such things as if you were the first person to come across an accident and you don't stop and try to help or at Least stop and notify the authorities.

449
00:29:42,138 --> 00:29:44,588
Rym: you can go to jail or get a ticket or whatever the fines may be.

450
00:29:45,331 --> 00:29:48,410
Scott: Yeah, because I guess by doing that you're just delaying.

451
00:29:48,751 --> 00:29:53,748
Scott: You know how long it takes until the accident is handled and you're actually hurting people, you know, it's by your.

452
00:29:54,169 --> 00:30:01,150
Scott: well You're not really hurting them But you know your inaction is causing greater harm when you could have prevented harm.

453
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:06,930
Scott: One other thing I had I learned in Red Cross training is it let's say someone next to you as a heart attack, right?

454
00:30:07,851 --> 00:30:12,209
Scott: And you're gonna do CPR on them or you're gonna use a different fibrillator or something like that, right?

455
00:30:13,172 --> 00:30:15,089
Scott: You can't call 9-1-1 cuz you're doing that.

456
00:30:15,812 --> 00:30:18,201
Scott: What you do is you need to point at someone.

457
00:30:18,221 --> 00:30:19,385
Scott: you need to say you call 9-1-1.

458
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:24,120
Scott: You can't just say someone call 9-1-1 because nobody will.

459
00:30:24,661 --> 00:30:29,349
Scott: you need to point at someone and say you do it and Then watch them and make sure they do it.

460
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:32,678
Rym: Yep That applies to basically any dangerous situation.

461
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:42,953
Rym: if you're going to take charge take charge if you kind of half-assed Lee You know like you start to do something, but you don't say or you're not very authoritative Nothing's gonna happen.

462
00:30:43,475 --> 00:30:46,726
Scott: you need to say you do this you do that you do this and I'm gonna do this.

463
00:30:46,746 --> 00:30:47,429
Scott: go go go.

464
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,663
Rym: Yeah, don't wait for someone else to do that.

465
00:30:49,683 --> 00:31:02,838
Scott: Mm-hmm Cuz if you wait around for someone else to do that You're pretty much gonna wait for the police and I think it's been shown in many many studies that the number one factor in Saving lives and such is response time.

466
00:31:02,938 --> 00:31:08,819
Scott: So if you can do anything, you know - that is beneficial No matter how small it is.

467
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:14,110
Scott: the fact that you're doing it sooner is very helpful Especially when it comes to CPR and other forms of resuscitation.

468
00:31:15,371 --> 00:31:24,500
Rym: When in doubt it I mean even poorly done CPR is better than no CPR in most cases if someone actually had a heart attack Or isn't breathing.

469
00:31:25,043 --> 00:31:31,030
Scott: Yeah, and I mean the Heimlich maneuver I mean even if you don't go for CPR training You should know how to save a person who's choking on something.

470
00:31:31,572 --> 00:31:35,568
Rym: In fact, I just say as a general corollary how to not suck under pressure.

471
00:31:35,688 --> 00:31:41,690
Rym: in general I think everyone who doesn't have a reason not to should learn basic CPR and you know basic Heimlich things like that.

472
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:43,700
Scott: Yeah, the Red Cross gives little thingies.

473
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,685
Scott: You can go get training.

474
00:31:44,806 --> 00:31:48,430
Rym: You can read a website That'll give you the basic idea of it pretty handily.

475
00:31:48,571 --> 00:31:50,521
Scott: Yeah that too, but you know the Red Cross training it.

476
00:31:50,561 --> 00:31:52,048
Scott: you get the little card and stuff.

477
00:31:52,089 --> 00:31:52,350
Scott: It's cool.

478
00:31:52,531 --> 00:31:53,815
Scott: Yeah, I have a little card.

479
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:55,261
Rym: Oh, I don't have the card.

480
00:31:55,301 --> 00:31:57,710
Rym: I did it in like middle school and with the Cub Scouts.

481
00:31:58,511 --> 00:32:02,181
Scott: Alright, let's go back to some less dangerous personal type situations.

482
00:32:02,281 --> 00:32:07,916
Scott: Alright, let's say you're hanging out and Two people start yelling at each other and fighting.

483
00:32:08,438 --> 00:32:09,942
Rym: We've had that happen often.

484
00:32:10,343 --> 00:32:11,045
Scott: Yep.

485
00:32:11,105 --> 00:32:14,857
Scott: I think that's the number one most Occurrence that happens now.

486
00:32:14,957 --> 00:32:21,260
Rym: whenever this happens what I usually observe is that everyone is not involved Just sits there and like pretends it isn't happening.

487
00:32:21,862 --> 00:32:23,167
Scott: You know, that's not what I observe.

488
00:32:23,267 --> 00:32:28,710
Scott: I observe when It seems like there's different levels like when people are grr at each other, right?

489
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:31,296
Scott: But they're not confronting directly.

490
00:32:31,557 --> 00:32:33,243
Scott: people just seem to not talk about it.

491
00:32:33,423 --> 00:32:35,530
Scott: Try to stay, you know, try to distract.

492
00:32:36,234 --> 00:32:40,198
Scott: You know obfuscate You know and keep the people apart from each other.

493
00:32:40,218 --> 00:32:43,730
Scott: if people are standing there yelling at each other, right?

494
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:46,970
Scott: People will just kind of watch like ooh, what's gonna happen?

495
00:32:48,092 --> 00:32:50,589
Scott: Everyone will start paying attention to it instead of trying to obfuscate.

496
00:32:51,372 --> 00:32:54,865
Scott: As soon as it comes to blows people go in and grab them and pull them apart.

497
00:32:55,166 --> 00:32:59,000
Scott: It's like no no, no, you're not fine You know, that's at least that's what I've seen.

498
00:32:59,021 --> 00:33:00,811
Rym: Well, I guess it depends on what tie I mean.

499
00:33:00,831 --> 00:33:02,720
Rym: if it is it two strangers is it?

500
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,830
Rym: you know a group of friends and two people are angry at each other.

501
00:33:05,253 --> 00:33:07,067
Rym: Is it some drunks outside of a club man?

502
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:11,870
Scott: If I walk no matter what if I see, you know, all two drunks outside of a club might be an exception.

503
00:33:12,433 --> 00:33:18,400
Scott: But if I see two people like fighting an angry fight like, you know Trying to hurt each other and they don't have deadly weapons.

504
00:33:18,922 --> 00:33:20,649
Scott: I'm gonna friggin try to break it up.

505
00:33:22,071 --> 00:33:27,433
Rym: Well, see I would say Larry just because you don't know what they're fighting about or whose side you should be on No, you'd be on.

506
00:33:27,513 --> 00:33:28,055
Scott: they're fighting.

507
00:33:28,096 --> 00:33:29,963
Scott: the fact people shouldn't be fighting no matter what.

508
00:33:30,344 --> 00:33:31,850
Scott: so you don't care whose side you're on.

509
00:33:32,191 --> 00:33:38,217
Rym: Alright, alright, but here's just here's my point my cynical point What if it's two stupid people fighting over something stupid?

510
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:42,850
Rym: it if you letting them fight is probably the best societal outcome?

511
00:33:43,594 --> 00:33:45,142
Scott: No, it's not beating them.

512
00:33:45,243 --> 00:33:46,288
Scott: you beating them both up.

513
00:33:46,349 --> 00:33:52,374
Rym: separate Stupid people often tend to be fairly strong Sometimes.

514
00:33:52,555 --> 00:33:59,610
Scott: here's it is a slightly related example of fighting When I was walking down the street and there was a purse snatcher on the other side of the road.

515
00:33:59,751 --> 00:34:02,930
Scott: Oh, yeah, I talked about this in a the podcast the day it happened.

516
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:07,088
Rym: Yep It actually gave me a little bit of faith in humanity that maybe there's a lot of people out there who don't suck.

517
00:34:07,148 --> 00:34:08,473
Scott: quite so bad Is a purse snatcher.

518
00:34:08,654 --> 00:34:15,873
Scott: so people tried to catch him and of course a fight broke out and of course people ganged up on him And you know got him, you know You don't want to.

519
00:34:16,415 --> 00:34:19,929
Scott: there's sometimes when you got a you got a fight and sometimes when you break up fights.

520
00:34:20,493 --> 00:34:25,197
Rym: Yeah, I mean I guess in general at least far as I'm concerned I'll often take risks.

521
00:34:25,458 --> 00:34:31,070
Rym: if I think that the risks are appropriate to help people and If you're not if you won't take the risks, that's fine.

522
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:35,005
Rym: But bear in mind that if no one takes the risk often someone's going to get hurt.

523
00:34:35,609 --> 00:34:42,610
Scott: Yep Another thing is if you see a fight about to happen You can sometimes do something to stop it before you have to pull people apart.

524
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:48,770
Scott: Like if you see an angry guy running down the street, he's gonna hit someone, you know You can maybe stand in his way or knock him over.

525
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:54,983
Rym: He won't see you coming because he's looking at the guy's going to hit or if two Drunk punk kids are about to fight outside of a club.

526
00:34:55,304 --> 00:35:00,030
Rym: Just walk over call me say Alright guys, neither one of you wants to get arrested because someone already called the cops.

527
00:35:00,373 --> 00:35:01,849
Rym: So we'd best all get out of here.

528
00:35:02,151 --> 00:35:08,522
Rym: Yep, you know if you have the gift of gab at all You can very easily defuse bad situations like that now.

529
00:35:08,582 --> 00:35:09,505
Rym: back when I was in high school.

530
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:18,917
Rym: I was involved in a fairly Interesting situation along these lines and I'll just tell the story and how I reacted to it because I think it's a decent lesson in How to react to this sort of thing.

531
00:35:18,937 --> 00:35:40,710
Rym: All right, so I had a friend who was She's a good person, but she's a little unstable I guess and to make a long story short and to not mention any names She called me one day, you know early mid-evening needing a ride to her boyfriend's house and I wondered what was up and I heard yelling in the background, but I was bored and I figured this could only be interesting.

532
00:35:41,694 --> 00:35:47,138
Rym: So I drive over to her house I pick her up and I drive her over to his house and I park and she runs out of my car and runs Up to his front door.

533
00:35:47,887 --> 00:35:48,170
Rym: Okay?

534
00:35:49,953 --> 00:35:55,514
Rym: A large woman probably her boyfriend's mom since we're all in high school answers the door and Then the boyfriend comes out.

535
00:35:55,574 --> 00:36:01,654
Rym: There's a giant screaming shouting horrible mess of a rigmarole and rigmarole.

536
00:36:01,714 --> 00:36:10,749
Rym: yeah, I've said that word a lot lately and I probably would have walked out to see what was going on, but it ended before I could even really leave my car.

537
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:19,630
Rym: and Basically when what I gathered later the guy had broken up with her and she was not too happy with this She immediately tried to throw herself in front of traffic.

538
00:36:20,891 --> 00:36:30,850
Rym: uh-huh, yeah, so I bolted from my car and I tackled her and At this point the people in the house had like closed the door and they wanted nothing to do with it ended at this point.

539
00:36:31,671 --> 00:36:32,856
Rym: So I grabbed her.

540
00:36:32,936 --> 00:36:38,150
Rym: I put her in my car and I had a. my car didn't have child locks But my lasers locks are actually broken.

541
00:36:38,251 --> 00:36:45,916
Rym: So I basically locked her in the passenger side of my car And then I pulled up my cell phone and I didn't call the police or anything right away but I called another friend.

542
00:36:45,996 --> 00:36:47,924
Rym: so I'd have another body to you know.

543
00:36:47,964 --> 00:36:55,869
Rym: help deal with all this and Basically to make a long long long story short we ended up calling a hospital and taking care of the situation.

544
00:36:56,411 --> 00:36:57,074
Scott: Hospitals good.

545
00:36:57,335 --> 00:36:59,464
Rym: Yeah, and she from what I've heard.

546
00:36:59,504 --> 00:37:03,636
Rym: She's doing okay now, but Basically, here's a bad situation.

547
00:37:03,656 --> 00:37:07,370
Rym: a girl is trying to kill herself by throwing herself onto a freeway where their car coming.

548
00:37:08,311 --> 00:37:12,666
Rym: Now I tackled her and I can't think of any other way to resolve that situation.

549
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:15,076
Rym: I Anything else I could have done.

550
00:37:15,739 --> 00:37:18,110
Scott: there really isn't much you could do now other than you know.

551
00:37:18,171 --> 00:37:19,189
Rym: Just sit there and not care.

552
00:37:19,894 --> 00:37:23,879
Scott: You could drive your car out in front of traffic in front of her But then you're kind of like that.

553
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,890
Rym: I think that could have just made the situation worse.

554
00:37:26,171 --> 00:37:27,357
Scott: Yeah, you could have.

555
00:37:27,718 --> 00:37:34,690
Scott: you could have hit her with your car to like break her leg that way That way she'd learn her lesson and then you just drag her to the side of the road.

556
00:37:34,951 --> 00:37:45,170
Rym: Yeah, now the thing I know there's really there's not much else you can do though I guess I guess the examples I can make here that when you're in a situation like this You have to think and you have to keep a clear head.

557
00:37:45,593 --> 00:37:55,453
Rym: I mean if I just stood there going oh my god She probably would have been hit by a car Probably and to you have to think about a lot of things just in general and you won't be able to think unless you have A clear head.

558
00:37:55,815 --> 00:38:10,940
Rym: so I finally get her in my car and the whole time I'm watching because there was a way to unlock the door and I had to drive her somewhere so we could deal with her and I was very keenly aware of the fact that there's a decent chance She'll try to fling herself out of my car at some point.

559
00:38:11,302 --> 00:38:11,563
Rym: Yep.

560
00:38:11,643 --> 00:38:13,030
Rym: So I was prepared for that.

561
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:14,009
Scott: She should have put her in the trunk.

562
00:38:15,051 --> 00:38:16,576
Rym: It was a frickin laser.

563
00:38:16,596 --> 00:38:17,660
Scott: It has a trunk.

564
00:38:17,861 --> 00:38:18,463
Rym: Not in there.

565
00:38:18,483 --> 00:38:22,014
Rym: You can put a person in the trunk the backseat at least There's all right.

566
00:38:22,355 --> 00:38:23,378
Rym: You've ever seen a laser.

567
00:38:23,478 --> 00:38:24,742
Scott: It has a tiny backseat.

568
00:38:25,023 --> 00:38:27,350
Rym: All right, I couldn't fit in the backseat.

569
00:38:28,152 --> 00:38:29,216
Rym: I could not sit back there.

570
00:38:29,257 --> 00:38:32,170
Rym: There's no way I was gonna shove her back there because she was resisting me.

571
00:38:32,471 --> 00:38:35,827
Rym: She was still trying to throw herself in front of traffic the whole time.

572
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:38,194
Scott: great Yeah, that's pretty much.

573
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:44,568
Scott: the number one piece of advice at all is don't go crazy and just start doing stuff reflexively.

574
00:38:44,708 --> 00:38:47,656
Scott: or you know Don't use your penis brain.

575
00:38:47,716 --> 00:38:51,606
Scott: Don't use any other brain except the one in your head and keep it in control.

576
00:38:51,807 --> 00:38:52,990
Rym: Just think logically.

577
00:38:53,892 --> 00:38:55,559
Scott: Yeah, I mean think about this.

578
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:06,250
Scott: the purpose of seatbelts in a car Isn't so much to keep you from flying out the window Although it does have that effect is to keep the driver in the driver's seat in control.

579
00:39:07,013 --> 00:39:12,075
Scott: It's a safety mechanism which keeps the brain behind the vehicle Behind the wheel.

580
00:39:12,216 --> 00:39:14,328
Rym: I see the analogy you're making and it's a good one.

581
00:39:14,509 --> 00:39:18,050
Scott: Yes That is the number one thing no matter what the situation is no matter how crazy.

582
00:39:18,752 --> 00:39:20,035
Scott: Keep the brain behind the wheel.

583
00:39:20,436 --> 00:39:21,258
Rym: now case in point.

584
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:22,622
Rym: Here's a nice quick example.

585
00:39:22,682 --> 00:39:28,845
Rym: Say you're in a nightclub and a fire breaks out Like a sudden flash fire and it's a crowd.

586
00:39:29,508 --> 00:39:34,930
Rym: now Half the crowd is probably gonna freak out and start screaming and running for the exit and creating a big mess.

587
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:40,690
Rym: The first thing you need to do is one get away from the fire to get away from the crowd.

588
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:43,339
Rym: Don't follow the crowd don't scream and run.

589
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,410
Rym: just think and look for a way out.

590
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:48,178
Rym: That doesn't involve the crowd and just walk slowly toward it.

591
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,210
Scott: Also check for fire extinguishers fire alarms.

592
00:39:53,034 --> 00:39:56,540
Scott: You know know your exit paths But think these things.

593
00:39:56,621 --> 00:40:01,205
Rym: if you're not clear in the head There's no way you're gonna think of all that you'll be crushed by the masses trying to get out the door.

594
00:40:01,366 --> 00:40:07,189
Scott: if this smoke get Low if this fire stop drop and roll, you know, this is first-grade stuff.

595
00:40:07,229 --> 00:40:14,090
Rym: kiddies Stop drop and roll, but adults No one in the world seems to be able to actually deal with this sort of thing when there's ever an actual design.

596
00:40:14,151 --> 00:40:17,358
Rym: Like look at New Orleans It was just an unmitigated disaster.

597
00:40:17,378 --> 00:40:29,877
Rym: and of not counting all the federal mistakes and you know The various issues surrounding New Orleans the fact remains that everyone assumed that the government and other people were going to take care of them And they did not work.

598
00:40:30,379 --> 00:40:32,550
Rym: at least many people did not work to take care of themselves.

599
00:40:32,871 --> 00:40:37,149
Rym: Yep, don't rely on other people to save you because they often will not get there in time.

600
00:40:37,671 --> 00:40:46,162
Scott: Yeah, and while the on the one hand these people do have some sort of a you know a complaint that hey The government said it would do this and it didn't do it true?

601
00:40:46,182 --> 00:40:53,929
Scott: on the other hand If they're not gonna do it, you can't complain so much if you don't do anything to help yourself at all.

602
00:40:54,632 --> 00:41:03,290
Scott: You know, I mean if you did everything you could and then it's still you were still stuck And then someone said they would help you and they didn't then you could have a real complaint.

603
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:09,815
Scott: But if you're you know, just not doing anything and expecting someone else to save you I really don't have any pity.

604
00:41:10,417 --> 00:41:15,618
Rym: now even on a small scale just any small anything that happens to you Don't expect anyone else to just march in and save you.

605
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:23,207
Rym: you'll often have to deal with the situation on your own And if you wait for the police to arrive or you wait for the fire department to arrive things may just get worse.

606
00:41:23,388 --> 00:41:28,530
Scott: on the interim Mm-hmm, and I notice a lot of people either just when things are gonna happen to them.

607
00:41:28,651 --> 00:41:36,028
Scott: they either just let the things happen and Then feel bad for themselves that their life sucks and then their life begins to suck because they let bad things happen to them.

608
00:41:37,611 --> 00:41:43,350
Scott: Or they you know, it's try to get other people to do things about it And then sure they avert a lot of trouble.

609
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:48,450
Scott: But then they end up as people who can't really do anything and they're always relying on others.

610
00:41:49,194 --> 00:41:52,210
Scott: And then eventually they get into a trap and then they're like, oh my god.

611
00:41:53,171 --> 00:41:57,245
Rym: Now to back away from disaster talk a bit in addition to keeping a clear head.

612
00:41:57,787 --> 00:41:58,569
Rym: take action.

613
00:41:58,589 --> 00:42:07,114
Rym: if There's a situation and you can affect it and you think that affecting it or changing it will alter the outcome in a positive way act Now.

614
00:42:07,174 --> 00:42:10,509
Rym: this may seem stupid but most people just don't act, you know, they act by reflex.

615
00:42:11,252 --> 00:42:14,966
Scott: Yep, you know you might have the clear head and you might be thinking of the right thing to do.

616
00:42:15,027 --> 00:42:22,463
Scott: like, you know The best thing for me to do is to walk right out of that exit over there But your body is still running running like a crazy nut.

617
00:42:22,946 --> 00:42:26,601
Scott: don't do that Because then you're all your effort of clear headedness has gone to waste.

618
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:28,810
Rym: now a nice non-threatening example.

619
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:31,769
Rym: Let's say you're living with someone and they do something you don't like.

620
00:42:32,171 --> 00:42:39,509
Rym: Maybe they don't do the dishes or they're passive-aggressive weird and they bother you or they leave their toenail clippings out.

621
00:42:40,472 --> 00:42:41,616
Scott: Great examples from real life.

622
00:42:41,977 --> 00:42:44,987
Rym: Yeah, not between the two of us, but mostly from other people we know.

623
00:42:45,368 --> 00:42:52,410
Rym: but anyway Now if you don't confront them about this situation you really have no complaint you can make.

624
00:42:53,213 --> 00:42:59,540
Scott: yeah, I mean, let's say Rym has a problem with Leaving his dirty clothes all around the house.

625
00:42:59,761 --> 00:43:01,530
Rym: Yeah, like underwear just on the ceiling.

626
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:12,130
Scott: yeah, now if I don't say anything like hey, can you stop leaving your underwear on the ceiling and One day there's like a crazy fight and I'm like, oh you leave your underwear in the ceiling.

627
00:43:12,573 --> 00:43:14,850
Scott: I really can't say that cuz I didn't tell him to stop.

628
00:43:15,231 --> 00:43:16,174
Scott: Yeah, is he supposed to know?

629
00:43:16,194 --> 00:43:22,375
Rym: we know a lot of people who are just very passive-aggressive out there and instead of Confronting a situation.

630
00:43:22,395 --> 00:43:25,930
Rym: They'll just get angrier and angrier and they expect everyone else to know that they're angry.

631
00:43:26,572 --> 00:43:30,043
Scott: It's much easier to just you know, sometimes tell a person.

632
00:43:30,364 --> 00:43:31,427
Scott: Hey, can you do this?

633
00:43:31,688 --> 00:43:32,330
Scott: Hey, can you do this?

634
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:33,378
Scott: Then to all at once go.

635
00:43:33,741 --> 00:43:34,770
Rym: Oh my god, you're terrible.

636
00:43:35,932 --> 00:43:41,329
Rym: I mean, I guess to put it succinctly nip problems in the bud to quote the late and great Barney Fife.

637
00:43:41,872 --> 00:43:46,589
Rym: Mmm, and there's a. if a situation is bad Stop it before it gets worse.

638
00:43:47,471 --> 00:43:49,861
Rym: If there's like if you have a little fire on your desk put it out now.

639
00:43:50,162 --> 00:43:52,050
Rym: don't wait until your whole desk is on fire.

640
00:43:52,752 --> 00:43:54,698
Rym: Yeah, you know stitching time saves nine.

641
00:43:54,718 --> 00:43:55,461
Rym: Mmm.

642
00:43:55,581 --> 00:43:57,488
Rym: I could just keep saying things like that all night.

643
00:43:57,748 --> 00:44:02,889
Scott: Yeah Another thing the to keep in mind is you want to not be a wuss?

644
00:44:03,871 --> 00:44:06,469
Rym: Yeah, now that may sound very generic, but it's very true.

645
00:44:07,173 --> 00:44:09,402
Scott: I mean you might think of the right thing to do.

646
00:44:10,085 --> 00:44:11,129
Scott: you might you know?

647
00:44:12,171 --> 00:44:18,030
Scott: Exactly, you might get the action ready, but then you wuss out because you're afraid.

648
00:44:18,313 --> 00:44:20,070
Rym: Have you ever been in like a crowd situation?

649
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:29,129
Rym: When you know you're right and when you know your course of action is a good one or you know, you know Like alright, that's what they should do to fix this and then you just stand there and wait for them to do it.

650
00:44:29,973 --> 00:44:33,006
Scott: Or you tell someone, you know, let's go back to the previous example.

651
00:44:33,046 --> 00:44:39,148
Scott: you tell someone Hey, stop leaving your underwear around the house and they don't stop Don't let it go.

652
00:44:40,071 --> 00:44:43,223
Scott: You know, you just let it go cuz you're too wussy to do something about it.

653
00:44:43,624 --> 00:44:45,250
Rym: in other words be that guy.

654
00:44:45,572 --> 00:44:49,279
Rym: You know how whenever this is normally you don't want to be that guy But in this case you want to be that guy.

655
00:44:49,902 --> 00:44:53,141
Rym: if no one's taking charge Be the guy who takes charge.

656
00:44:53,584 --> 00:44:55,316
Rym: actually at Katsucon There's a little example.

657
00:44:55,396 --> 00:44:57,169
Rym: one of the announcers on stage was talking about.

658
00:44:57,712 --> 00:45:03,514
Rym: He was making an announcement about how two panels were switched the antenna panel and the club summit panel and he didn't remember the name Of the second panel.

659
00:45:03,936 --> 00:45:04,740
Rym: So he's up there.

660
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:16,410
Rym: He says the antenna panel and the I don't have a and he just starts floundering and No one's like making a move to tell him what it is and he's not making a move to find out.

661
00:45:16,771 --> 00:45:21,070
Rym: So I just shout it out the club summit panel and he looks he's like, oh, thanks.

662
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:22,214
Rym: And then the show kept going.

663
00:45:22,797 --> 00:45:25,025
Rym: you want to be that guy the guy who everyone thinks.

664
00:45:25,387 --> 00:45:26,190
Rym: Ah, he fixed it.

665
00:45:27,171 --> 00:45:30,950
Scott: Mm-hmm, no matter what you think, you know bad will happen to you.

666
00:45:31,957 --> 00:45:41,418
Scott: The consequences of whatever You know the damage for your bravery might be or the risk because that's what bravery is It's a risk taking to achieve something good.

667
00:45:41,438 --> 00:45:50,150
Scott: You know, the more risk you take the braver you are and Whatever that risk is it's probably worse than just letting the bad thing happen.

668
00:45:51,212 --> 00:45:52,477
Scott: You know or equal.

669
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:57,269
Rym: I mean, I guess I have another relevant old saying Fortune favors the bold.

670
00:45:58,213 --> 00:46:05,457
Rym: if you're basically if you live your life actively and you take an active role in the Situations that can affect you you can alter their outcome.

671
00:46:06,039 --> 00:46:12,341
Rym: if you live your life passively and you passively accept what life gives you You're never gonna get anything beyond what life gives you.

672
00:46:12,682 --> 00:46:14,450
Rym: and I got to tell you life gives you shit.

673
00:46:15,213 --> 00:46:17,183
Scott: Yeah, life pretty much gives you the sticks.

674
00:46:17,927 --> 00:46:21,570
Rym: I mean We're not - I only get one stick.

675
00:46:23,132 --> 00:46:31,010
Scott: Yeah sticks Like all these situations that happen that you remember are gonna be situations in which bad things are gonna happen.

676
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:34,101
Scott: You know when good things happen, you don't have to do anything.

677
00:46:34,442 --> 00:46:36,470
Scott: You don't need to know stuff to deal with good.

678
00:46:37,213 --> 00:46:38,098
Scott: You know good hat.

679
00:46:38,118 --> 00:46:40,610
Scott: you need the same amount of good will happen that you can bring about.

680
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:47,399
Scott: we have to do most importantly is take the bad stuff and Make it as less bad as you possibly can.

681
00:46:47,479 --> 00:46:48,162
Rym: What do you want to be?

682
00:46:48,182 --> 00:46:50,370
Rym: Neville Chamberlain or Winston Churchill?

683
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:58,020
Scott: Funny I don't know how many people listening know about history.

684
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,825
Scott: that would get the joke they better.

685
00:46:59,845 --> 00:47:01,250
Rym: that wasn't that long ago.

686
00:47:01,901 --> 00:47:04,276
Scott: Yeah We weren't alive though.

687
00:47:04,597 --> 00:47:05,421
Rym: No, we weren't alive.

688
00:47:05,441 --> 00:47:05,923
Rym: But you know what?

689
00:47:06,185 --> 00:47:06,506
Rym: I know.

690
00:47:06,526 --> 00:47:10,810
Rym: Yeah All right, so that wraps up our first themed week how to not suck week.

691
00:47:11,432 --> 00:47:17,690
Rym: I'll note that the only reason we picked that theme was because it seemed easy and we're still recovering from last weekend.

692
00:47:17,871 --> 00:47:18,774
Rym: So we're kind of tired.

693
00:47:18,955 --> 00:47:25,358
Scott: Yeah, and we're sorry if you know a week and how not to suck sucked but Next week is gonna be a much better week.

694
00:47:25,378 --> 00:47:26,342
Rym: We think we're gonna.

00:47:26,382 --> 00:47:28,110
Scott: week is gonna be such an awesome week.

696
00:47:28,472 --> 00:47:31,169
Scott: It'll make up for any suckage of the how not to suck week.

697
00:47:31,573 --> 00:47:33,770
Rym: Yeah, mostly because we're gonna get a good night's sleep this weekend.

698
00:47:34,151 --> 00:47:37,845
Scott: Yeah here let me how not to suck at deciding what to do for the podcast all week.

00:47:44,566 --> 00:47:45,370
Rym: All right, let's warn him.
