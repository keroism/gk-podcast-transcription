00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,184
Rym: I called Luke like the right and honorable just to see if he'd react to it and the fact that he did was funny be Wrong and dishonorable.

Rym: We're here with Jared Sorenson the creator of parsley games such as action castle and Z Ward.

17

Scott: He's like my joke.

21
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:21,118

00:02:30,406 --> 00:02:33,840

Guest: It was ridiculously fun.

95
00:04:31,711 --> 00:04:33,120
Rym: I would like to go to that in Essen.

96
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:38,283
Rym: I really want to go to and I'm trying to swing some business to have an excuse to be over in Germany right around Essen time.

97
00:04:38,443 --> 00:04:38,725
Rym: Yeah.

98
00:04:39,046 --> 00:04:39,869
Guest: Yeah, you should definitely.

99
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:40,632
Scott: let's go in a tangent.

100
00:04:40,652 --> 00:04:41,656
Scott: What's it like over there?

101
00:04:41,998 --> 00:04:42,560
Guest: It's crazy.

102
00:04:43,186 --> 00:04:50,316
Guest: I really want to go to the Finnish game con for a bunch of reasons But the Danish con fast of all it's.

103
00:04:50,517 --> 00:04:52,462
Guest: um It's weird.

104
00:04:52,522 --> 00:04:54,048
Guest: It's not typical role-playing.

105
00:04:54,108 --> 00:04:54,871
Guest: It's not what you think about.

106
00:04:54,911 --> 00:05:04,845
Guest: It's not a bunch of people sitting around a table with dice and screens and character sheets, it's a lot of Essentially like improv acting.

107
00:05:05,266 --> 00:05:08,435
Guest: like you get a scenario which is the scenarios are weird.

108
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:14,329
Guest: Most of them are realistic Historical or kind of literary.

109
00:05:14,851 --> 00:05:18,919
Guest: the one I was in was like a Lars Van Trier movie we had.

110
00:05:19,984 --> 00:05:26,652
Guest: it was called Easter a tragedy and I played the Sun in a four-person household.

111
00:05:27,274 --> 00:05:32,230
Guest: my sister and I had come back from From Copenhagen to visit our family out in the country.

112
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:38,546
Guest: And so we visited mom and dad and in the game We actually went to this The the con.

113
00:05:38,586 --> 00:05:42,340
Guest: that part of the con was held in classrooms and we actually knocked on the door of the classroom.

114
00:05:42,982 --> 00:05:46,452
Guest: Our mom and dad let us in and we sat down and actually ate Thanksgiving.

115
00:05:46,472 --> 00:05:47,835
Guest: I'm not Thanksgiving.

116
00:05:47,855 --> 00:05:50,644
Guest: I'm sorry Easter dinner Is Easter.

117
00:05:50,965 --> 00:05:53,111
Guest: a tragedy was actual food actual food.

118
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:53,653
Scott: like.

119
00:05:53,673 --> 00:05:55,840
Scott: you didn't have to go get lunch because the food was like the game.

120
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:56,287
Scott: It was.

121
00:05:56,552 --> 00:05:56,816
Guest: it was.

122
00:05:58,225 --> 00:06:04,748
Guest: It was brown bread butter Pickled herring Historically accurate food.

123
00:06:04,829 --> 00:06:06,619
Guest: It was all like traditional Easter.

124
00:06:07,303 --> 00:06:12,670
Guest: Easter the GM that the guy who wrote The GM was okay.

125
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,294
Guest: So here's the weird thing about Danish tradition.

126
00:06:14,635 --> 00:06:16,320
Guest: The GM is essentially the director.

127
00:06:17,062 --> 00:06:20,735
Guest: So if he doesn't like how things are going he will step in and he will whisper in your ear.

128
00:06:21,257 --> 00:06:24,530
Guest: be more intense Or you feel very sad about this.

129
00:06:24,771 --> 00:06:33,697
Rym: Well, Luke does that to me when I play in his game But but I mean the Danish guys will.

130
00:06:33,757 --> 00:06:38,294
Guest: actually We were in things where they made us redo scenes that they were.

131
00:06:38,334 --> 00:06:40,040
Guest: they didn't feel we captured the moment.

132
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,532
Scott: They're recording these on video.

133
00:06:41,653 --> 00:06:42,378
Guest: No, no, it was.

134
00:06:43,523 --> 00:06:48,980
Rym: That almost might cheapen it in that it like without having a record you only have the rosy memory.

135
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,185
Rym: So there's no.

136
00:06:50,205 --> 00:06:52,916
Scott: so this isn't like there's no rules book you can buy for this right?

137
00:06:52,956 --> 00:06:53,960
Guest: No, no, there's scenarios.

138
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,102
Guest: Oh the scenario tradition.

139
00:06:55,142 --> 00:06:56,624
Guest: It's weird because they'll they'll.

140
00:06:56,924 --> 00:06:59,708
Guest: they'll have people write scenarios and the writer.

141
00:06:59,868 --> 00:07:13,690
Guest: the role of the writer is Huge like, you know RPGs whatever you come with the scenario who cares see it's all about the players play play play In Denmark, it's all about the writer of the scenario and the person who runs it and it's basically the writers vision in the directors.

142
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,738
Scott: Implement implementation of that.

143
00:07:16,758 --> 00:07:19,730
Guest: you're essentially it's like George Lucas directing his human actors.

144
00:07:20,233 --> 00:07:23,149
Guest: You know where he just kind of treats them as the same as the CG actors.

145
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:25,573
Guest: It's weird.

146
00:07:25,633 --> 00:07:27,421
Guest: we had we had one player in one of the games.

147
00:07:27,461 --> 00:07:32,329
Guest: I was in actually run out of the room crying and she With the game Because it got really intense.

148
00:07:33,773 --> 00:07:34,757
Rym: So I got a question.

149
00:07:34,797 --> 00:07:37,670
Rym: Do you think we could sell something like that?

150
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:42,525
Rym: Not not monetary not commercialized but like get people in the US to play a game.

151
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,250
Guest: totally no problem.

152
00:07:44,411 --> 00:07:52,663
Guest: So I could I could rewrite Easter a tragedy for an American audience Which it basically just involves changing maybe the holiday and definitely changing the food.

153
00:07:53,084 --> 00:07:58,053
Guest: Well the language I had an English version of it But pretty much straight-up run it.

154
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:01,498
Guest: you are a conservative family out in the Midwest.

155
00:08:01,998 --> 00:08:03,140
Guest: you're home from the big city.

156
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:07,730
Scott: No from the military from the military, whatever, you know, whatever.

157
00:08:08,771 --> 00:08:13,730
Guest: And the interesting thing about so the interesting thing about Easter which I which I didn't explain is every.

158
00:08:14,713 --> 00:08:20,090
Guest: The game is divided into phases and essentially the game ends when the good mood at the table is broken.

159
00:08:20,492 --> 00:08:24,370
Guest: So when a fight breaks out or when somebody cries or when when something bad happens.

160
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:31,326
Guest: And the thing is when once you eat dinner There's a very there's a set ritual about what you eat when and what you talk about and stuff like that.

161
00:08:31,707 --> 00:08:46,226
Guest: and it's weird talking about Basically making small talk with people you don't know in real life who are portraying people that you don't know because you haven't Met them before in the game, but you're supposed to intimately know them because you're a family.

162
00:08:46,628 --> 00:08:49,229
Guest: really weird But by the second phase it was easy.

163
00:08:50,013 --> 00:08:50,877
Guest: so the first phase we.

164
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:56,790
Guest: you go through dinner and blah blah blah blah, and then the mother says Well, you should probably be heading back.

165
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:08,984
Guest: It's getting dark and that's the cue for everybody to basically say their goodbyes Shake hands hug whatever and then leave and then the GM hands out little secrets about what happened in that year And then you go back and you play the next year Easter dinner.

166
00:09:09,688 --> 00:09:18,466
Guest: Oh You do this over and over and over again Which meant I ate a lot of pickled herring during that game Which thankfully I like that stuff, but it was.

167
00:09:18,486 --> 00:09:19,972
Guest: you know It was.

168
00:09:20,133 --> 00:09:20,615
Guest: it was rough.

169
00:09:21,378 --> 00:09:22,081
Rym: that's some good stuff.

170
00:09:22,121 --> 00:09:22,442
Rym: we got it.

171
00:09:22,783 --> 00:09:26,536
Rym: we got to get that gaming Concept into us gamers.

172
00:09:26,697 --> 00:09:29,508
Scott: is everyone at the con playing Easter or were there just a bunch of different?

173
00:09:29,568 --> 00:09:29,910
Scott: No there was.

174
00:09:30,274 --> 00:09:35,325
Guest: I think there were four Sessions of Easter going on concurrently, and that's yeah, so there were only.

175
00:09:35,365 --> 00:09:36,730
Scott: there weren't that many scenarios.

176
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,517
Scott: They were doing the same one a lot.

177
00:09:38,859 --> 00:09:38,999
Guest: Well.

178
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:42,318
Guest: Here's the thing it's really weird is what they'll do is They'll hand off.

179
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:48,708
Guest: They'll write the scenario They'll hand it off to a bunch of GM's and a bunch of GM's at the con will run the same scenario for a bunch of groups.

180
00:09:50,332 --> 00:09:55,854
Guest: So it's not like this one game system being run by many people, but it's different Scenarios or adventures or whatever.

181
00:09:56,215 --> 00:09:58,321
Guest: it's like no you're running Easter a tragedy.

182
00:09:58,381 --> 00:10:00,287
Guest: you're running sex drugs and rock and roll.

183
00:10:00,327 --> 00:10:10,348
Guest: you're running 15 men and there's a meeting where you actually get the materials and sometimes That's the first time you've seen this stuff, so you read it the GM's read it, and then they run it.

184
00:10:11,451 --> 00:10:15,430
Scott: That could even work with just our kind of tabletop RPGs where you know you go to a con.

185
00:10:15,853 --> 00:10:21,060
Scott: Someone writes up like three Burning wheel mascot scenarios for the con and just hands them out.

186
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,250
Scott: get it yeah ten GM's over and you're like here's the scenarios.

187
00:10:24,871 --> 00:10:27,630
Scott: Everyone go and run them you know and then it's like players.

188
00:10:27,852 --> 00:10:33,345
Rym: He has all the tables there's an interesting kind of mechanism Designed to that of the whole con and that now all these players are playing.

189
00:10:33,365 --> 00:10:37,199
Rym: these games have a shared But disparate experience which forces them to talk to each other.

190
00:10:37,319 --> 00:10:38,462
Rym: Oh, how did your yeah go?

191
00:10:38,623 --> 00:10:39,786
Rym: well everybody died.

192
00:10:39,867 --> 00:10:43,470
Guest: well Easter so Easter Theoretically will last until the mood is broken.

193
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:53,090
Guest: we we went I think three or four years before my sister and father got into an argument about Drinking because she did not want to tell him she was pregnant because he would have flipped out.

194
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,881
Guest: And so he was like oh, why are you being rude?

195
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:56,404
Guest: Why you know?

196
00:10:56,505 --> 00:10:57,510
Guest: I'm just trying to be hospitable.

197
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,539
Guest: Why are you being you know so rude and so bratty?

198
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,187
Guest: and they got into a screaming match in.

199
00:11:01,207 --> 00:11:01,770
Guest: the game ended?

200
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,356
Scott: Oh, but he wanted her to drink.

201
00:11:03,456 --> 00:11:06,593
Guest: Yeah, and she was like no, but she doesn't want to say I'm pregnant I can't drink.

202
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:07,457
Guest: She just has to say no.

203
00:11:07,477 --> 00:11:08,341
Guest: I'm not feeling like it.

204
00:11:08,944 --> 00:11:10,210
Guest: He's like oh your brother's gonna drive.

205
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:11,838
Scott: That's good on the writer.

206
00:11:11,858 --> 00:11:12,625
Scott: They're coming up with that.

207
00:11:12,665 --> 00:11:13,190
Scott: It's really good.

208
00:11:13,471 --> 00:11:17,570
Guest: So what happens in the fifth year is the father drops dead at the table of a heart attack?

209
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:25,100
Guest: So no matter what happens the game ends after like five years, but man that fifth year It's like a Darren Aronofsky film everybody's secrets that you get.

210
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,704
Guest: it's just like oh my god.

211
00:11:26,724 --> 00:11:27,467
Guest: I want to kill myself.

212
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:31,455
Rym: This is so depressing I Feel like it solves a big problem.

213
00:11:31,475 --> 00:11:36,582
Rym: I mean even at burning apocalypse con like the so-called hardcore like we are hardcore role players Let's go.

214
00:11:37,938 --> 00:11:39,429
Guest: No idea what hardcore isn't.

215
00:11:41,072 --> 00:11:41,374
Rym: This is.

216
00:11:41,394 --> 00:11:44,063
Rym: this is like a guy coming up to me like I'm a metal head.

217
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:45,810
Rym: I listen to Metallica every day.

218
00:11:48,191 --> 00:11:51,769
Guest: There's one game very controversial game, I don't even know if I should talk about it.

219
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:58,330
Guest: It's called And I'm spacing on the title something about the fat man.

220
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:00,981
Scott: Is it insulting to fat people?

221
00:12:01,202 --> 00:12:02,169
Scott: yes, okay?

222
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,721
Guest: Extremely, so here's how you play.

223
00:12:05,264 --> 00:12:06,110
Guest: everybody plays.

224
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:16,346
Guest: So What happens is the fastest people got the fattest male player in the game session plays the fat man.

225
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,093
Rym: that might prove contentious in the US.

226
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,789
Guest: well get out the scales.

227
00:12:21,593 --> 00:12:28,450
Guest: You know the scales in the in the measuring tape so that so that the largest male player Plays the fat man everybody else plays the friends of the fat man.

228
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:37,095
Guest: And I'm kind of air quoting friends because what the friends of the fat man do during the game is insult the fat man Constantly berate and belittle him.

229
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:46,527
Guest: the fat man has a pocketful of candy and whenever he eats a piece of candy They have to stop berating and belittling him and actually complement him and act really super nice to him like they're.

230
00:12:46,668 --> 00:12:48,054
Guest: like the fat man Is the best friend.

231
00:12:48,295 --> 00:12:50,044
Rym: wow that's already a little messed up.

232
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:53,509
Guest: No it gets better It's so much better.

233
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,075
Guest: So the fat man has.

234
00:12:57,336 --> 00:13:06,975
Guest: the fat man character is given a safe word which if the game gets too Stressful and intense he can say that the the safe word in the game will end Except privately.

235
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:09,489
Guest: the friends of the fat man are told to ignore the safe word.

236
00:13:10,611 --> 00:13:20,987
Guest: So the game ends when the fat man gets so upset that he actually leaves and the game is supposed to and I love this Is what's great about Denmark because everything has this deep meaning to it, and they're very serious and very earnest.

237
00:13:21,027 --> 00:13:21,750
Guest: They're really cool.

238
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:28,430
Guest: But it's kind of comical because the the scenario guys like yes, this is and I can't really do a Danish accent.

239
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:35,229
Guest: Yes this because of the game is to make you feel guilty about about being so mean to the fat man.

240
00:13:35,671 --> 00:13:37,198
Guest: That's what the game is about about your shame.

241
00:13:37,218 --> 00:13:38,363
Guest: I'm like.

242
00:13:38,504 --> 00:13:39,829
Guest: it just seems like abuse to me.

243
00:13:42,251 --> 00:13:44,580
Scott: You're teaching the people the players a lesson.

244
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,845
Scott: what about the fat man?

245
00:13:45,885 --> 00:13:47,070
Guest: Yeah, he's crying in the dark.

246
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:51,207
Scott: I know I feel like you could be sacrificed for the better of the group.

247
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:51,910
Rym: some experiences.

248
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:55,029
Rym: We've talked about a GeekNights back in the day with casting people out of the crew.

249
00:13:55,471 --> 00:14:00,470
Rym: Did you know it's very difficult when there's a guy that nobody's actually friends with but you know he's really in a tentacle porn.

250
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:01,888
Rym: you Try to make him leave you alone.

251
00:14:02,351 --> 00:14:03,334
Rym: Finally someone breaks it to him.

252
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:07,729
Rym: You could make it the game that you give to people as the final resort.

253
00:14:07,849 --> 00:14:14,469
Guest: Yes Hey You want to play a game in case of bad game or break glass and inside is a cop games as tools to.

254
00:14:14,529 --> 00:14:17,850
Rym: actually You're working on your YouTube game.

255
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:22,183
Rym: My game is a card game that you play to decide what the fuck to do.

256
00:14:22,263 --> 00:14:24,470
Rym: right now who gets control of the internet TV?

257
00:14:24,952 --> 00:14:29,968
Rym: Yes, but mine's a card game that also does meta stuff like ordering pizza.

258
00:14:30,891 --> 00:14:32,255
Scott: That's actually a clever idea right cuz?

259
00:14:32,275 --> 00:14:37,050
Scott: like people always talk about you know jokingly how like diplomacy is a friend killer or something right?

260
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:37,876
Scott: Well, it's like what.

261
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,508
Scott: if you want to get rid of some friends?

262
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,076
Scott: You could make a game that helps you.

263
00:14:42,137 --> 00:14:49,163
Scott: it's like you know or maybe even stand because most most games They help you make friends even if they're not designed specifically to do so.

264
00:14:49,545 --> 00:14:52,479
Scott: you could probably make a game That is like the friend making game.

265
00:14:52,882 --> 00:14:56,054
Scott: right you know you need to make the Girlfriend getting game.

266
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,263
Guest: well, that's breaking the ass Emily care boss.

267
00:14:58,283 --> 00:14:59,367
Scott: Did that did she?

268
00:14:59,668 --> 00:15:00,090
Scott: what's it called?

269
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,636
Guest: I'm not breaking the ice is it?

270
00:15:02,299 --> 00:15:07,282
Rym: so there's actually a lot of like mini LARP's with simple rules that are designed for that.

271
00:15:07,322 --> 00:15:07,443
Rym: like.

272
00:15:07,463 --> 00:15:08,187

Rym: don't break the ice.

277
00:15:17,225 --> 00:15:17,626

Guest: that is it.

282
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:35,896
Guest: yeah apparently people actually have gotten together after playing that game, huh All right, nobody's gone together after playing action castle though There's too many people although.

283
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:36,518

00:15:43,864 --> 00:15:49,334
Guest: Maybe maybe in the future Playtesting that will be interesting Not it.

289
00:15:49,656 --> 00:15:51,286
Guest: I probably won't do it at Gen Con.

290
00:15:51,306 --> 00:15:52,794
Rym: maybe packs But packs you get.

291
00:15:52,894 --> 00:15:55,926
Rym: mag fest has a surprising proportion not to of like.

292
00:15:56,127 --> 00:16:00,311
Rym: I'm gonna do it 50 I'm gonna do it in Finland 70 30.

293
00:16:00,311 --> 00:16:02,683
Scott: Yes, yeah, I mean if they have the real food.

294
00:16:02,703 --> 00:16:04,150
Scott: They've got to have the real sex too, right?

295
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:08,089
Guest: I mean that apparently they they have done large shot of our IT.

296
00:16:08,972 --> 00:16:09,855
Rym: It was exactly like.

297
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:10,959
Scott: you don't want those people.

298
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:11,962
Rym: I mean they were.

299
00:16:12,003 --> 00:16:13,187
Rym: they weren't role-playing vampires.

300
00:16:13,207 --> 00:16:14,190
Rym: They were vampires.

301
00:16:14,692 --> 00:16:16,340
Scott: That's different people are.

302
00:16:16,381 --> 00:16:17,566
Scott: they didn't even count as people.

303
00:16:17,707 --> 00:16:19,389
Scott: I mean come on whatever.

304
00:16:20,491 --> 00:16:24,710
Rym: But but to back up a little bit, you know the super the so-called hardcore like role players in America.

305
00:16:25,534 --> 00:16:32,989
Rym: Even like the best role players I know will be in character for maybe 30 seconds of their great monologue and then it always trails off into.

306
00:16:33,009 --> 00:16:35,702
Rym: yeah I try to convince the guy to not kill my son.

307
00:16:35,802 --> 00:16:36,626
Rym: It's role-playing.

308
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:40,784
Rym: It's not acting Yeah, but I feel like the acting is happening.

309
00:16:40,824 --> 00:16:44,368
Guest: helps if you're a good actor it helps Yeah, but I like the games that trick people into acting.

310
00:16:44,409 --> 00:16:48,510
Rym: Yeah Like, you know burning wheels duel of wits kind of tricks people into like having a reasonable argument.

311
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,274
Rym: It's interesting.

312
00:16:49,294 --> 00:16:52,470
Scott: I actually don't know how well I would do as cool as like the Danish thing sounds.

313
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,540
Scott: It's like I'm not that good at acting.

314
00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:00,529
Scott: So like when it's so free like makes you stretch Yeah, but it's like, you know, that's why I like when there's dice and stuff.

315
00:17:00,851 --> 00:17:04,970
Scott: Not just because I like rolling dice, which I do but they do not like dice over there, right?

316
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:09,785
Scott: But because it helps me suck suck less when I have some numbers to go by right?

317
00:17:09,805 --> 00:17:11,329
Scott: It's like I'm a computer guy.

318
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:12,409
Scott: I know how to make numbers go up.

319
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:17,050
Scott: So it's like I'll just do the thing I need to make those numbers go up which happens to also be good acting at the same.

320
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:19,902
Rym: Yes, you did this like you go between the two like I found it's got you personally.

321
00:17:19,922 --> 00:17:23,215
Rym: you role-play better when you're not playing A character but you're playing an accent.

322
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:25,445
Rym: if you pick an accent you play a good character.

323
00:17:25,768 --> 00:17:29,740
Rym: That's Yeah, that's we need to make that an RPG.

324
00:17:30,624 --> 00:17:33,635
Scott: all the accent RPG Ridiculous accent.

325
00:17:33,816 --> 00:17:35,810
Rym: So how did you come up with the idea for action cows?

326
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:36,436
Rym: Like when was the?

327
00:17:36,457 --> 00:17:37,690
Rym: what was the moment where you're sitting there?

328
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,181
Rym: They're like I should run this for a bunch of people.

329
00:17:40,422 --> 00:17:41,446
Guest: I was at a party.

330
00:17:41,507 --> 00:17:42,210
Guest: I've told the story.

331
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:44,361
Guest: God, I just told the story in the genocides.

332
00:17:44,421 --> 00:17:45,326
Guest: go listen to her podcast.

333
00:17:45,547 --> 00:17:45,768
Scott: Okay?

334
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,936

Guest: yeah, listen to it's.

336
00:17:50,543 --> 00:17:51,668

00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,009
Guest: I was at a party.

339
00:17:54,951 --> 00:17:55,815
Guest: We were kind of hanging out.

340
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:56,618
Guest: I had this idea.

341
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:59,810
Guest: I'm a big text adventure fan from my days of yore.

342
00:18:00,091 --> 00:18:11,172
Guest: I actually worked for info comm as a 12 year old Playtesting one of their games and I got to tour their office and meet all the peeps there and I actually have My.

343
00:18:11,272 --> 00:18:20,800
Guest: I was going through my box of my box of sad memories and in my box of sad memories is a t-shirt I made with Floyd the robot from Planet Fall and on the back.

344
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,675
Guest: It says I love info comm and it would barely fit a Cabbage patch kid.

345
00:18:24,695 --> 00:18:25,319
Guest: It's hilarious.

346
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:25,742
Guest: I'm like man.

347
00:18:25,762 --> 00:18:26,849
Guest: I was a tiny little kid.

348
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:29,662
Guest: It's crazy.

349
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:32,662
Guest: But yeah, I loved info comm.

350
00:18:32,682 --> 00:18:38,286
Guest: I had a poster in my Poster in my bedroom for years that said what kind of computer were using for these info comm games?

351
00:18:38,447 --> 00:18:38,889
Guest: Oh Apple 2e.

352
00:18:41,314 --> 00:18:42,104
Guest: I owned a GS.

353
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:42,630
Guest: I never played.

354
00:18:43,491 --> 00:18:49,350
Guest: Yeah, I played wizardry all the time on my GS wizardry and Dungeon Master and some crappy games.

355
00:18:50,072 --> 00:18:53,345
Scott: If the thief the Apple 2 GS is probably the best computer there ever was.

356
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:54,469
Guest: that was pretty sweet.

357
00:18:54,771 --> 00:18:59,868
Rym: Yeah, that's why I have one because I know you know our experience with action castle was you we didn't.

358
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:00,972
Rym: you were just this weird Guy.

359
00:19:00,992 --> 00:19:04,850
Rym: and Luke still am a weird guy you are but Luke Crane was this other weird guy.

360
00:19:04,971 --> 00:19:08,541
Rym: He's very weird and you know He was that weird guy who tricked us into playing a stupid game.

361
00:19:08,722 --> 00:19:11,676
Guest: and I tricked you and I'm playing my stupid game Cuz we were at PAX.

362
00:19:11,716 --> 00:19:11,957
Rym: we did.

363
00:19:11,977 --> 00:19:14,770
Rym: you know that beyond Dungeons and Dragons like you guys should play.

364
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:15,954
Guest: That's right.

365
00:19:15,974 --> 00:19:17,243
Guest: Cuz cuz we did the.

Guest: We were.

368
00:19:18,793 --> 00:19:22,030
Guest: everybody was like kind of milling around looking for something to do after we were stupid.

369
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:25,907
Rym: We were like so and if anyone wants to play this game, that's the guy who made it.

370
00:19:25,967 --> 00:19:27,249
Rym: follow us out We'll find a table.

371
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:30,434
Scott: It was like Jared's gonna do the thing and I'm like what thing Cuz.

372
00:19:30,454 --> 00:19:34,796
Rym: we formed an angry mob of like 200 people who were like we want to play this We want to play burning meal.

373
00:19:34,876 --> 00:19:36,422
Scott: it's like already think but that was.

374
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:37,848
Scott: I was oh wait, I think.

375
00:19:38,089 --> 00:19:39,015
Scott: yeah I think that was.

376
00:19:39,035 --> 00:19:41,010
Rym: that was our first temper of oh wait.

377
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:44,284
Scott: So that's it's been like three four years.

378
00:19:44,304 --> 00:19:45,670
Rym: That was our first packs panel.

379
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:48,042
Rym: That was one of the first like fan panels ever at a packs.

380
00:19:48,082 --> 00:19:49,530
Rym: That was it was fun.

381
00:19:49,792 --> 00:19:51,988
Rym: Yeah, there's some like crappy video of that panel.

382
00:19:52,008 --> 00:19:52,229
Rym: we ran.

383
00:19:52,671 --> 00:19:55,161
Rym: I forgot how tiny those rooms used to be at packs for panels.

384
00:19:55,582 --> 00:19:57,690
Scott: I think they said what did they use that room for now?

385
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,663
Scott: I think that's now like the mag mag fest stage, right?

386
00:20:00,764 --> 00:20:02,070
Rym: Yeah, Scott came over to me.

387
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:10,609
Rym: He's like, yeah that the guy with the hair is gonna do some thing to get the crowd from killing us 30 Something people just kind of lined up going what is going on?

388
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:17,429
Rym: Yep, and then by the end like it became this legend of packs I got recognized in Grand Central Station leaving a Depeche Mode show.

389
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:30,709
Guest: These two kids who are at the anime con ConnectiCon They recognized me they were at that con and they recognized me in Grand Central and as I walked by I heard Hey, that's is that the action castle guy.

390
00:20:31,452 --> 00:20:32,174
Guest: And then I turned around.

391
00:20:32,214 --> 00:20:38,255
Guest: and then they do the torch hands and they go action castle and I was just like, oh my god Isn't that great?

392
00:20:38,275 --> 00:20:48,684
Rym: Like cuz we're you know, we're all like D level internet celebrities like D List like C list is perhaps even F list Like the bottom of Wil Wheaton's fandom, like we're.

393
00:20:48,744 --> 00:20:50,570
Rym: so like we're a level under if not more.

394
00:20:51,112 --> 00:20:55,650
Rym: Isn't it really fun when someone recognizes you in like New York like you feel like a big man for a few minutes?

395
00:20:55,731 --> 00:20:57,329
Rym: Yeah, I do but I'm like that.

396
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,449
Rym: Okay, really not at all.

397
00:21:00,212 --> 00:21:00,814
Guest: It's just kind of.

398
00:21:00,955 --> 00:21:03,423
Guest: it's what it makes me think of cuz.

399
00:21:03,523 --> 00:21:04,266
Guest: I think I've made some.

400
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:13,416
Guest: I haven't made a lot of Well known games, but you know, I've made some kind of cool ones some I'm really proud of and and it's like like John Gielgud going.

401
00:21:13,436 --> 00:21:19,463
Guest: I you know, I was in other movies - Besides that Star Wars crap, you know on my tombstone.

402
00:21:19,483 --> 00:21:26,273
Guest: It's gonna be like action castle guy Say I'm not dead yet Let's talk about.

403
00:21:26,313 --> 00:21:29,350
Rym: if all the games you've made that you can talk about what's your what's your favorite one?

404
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:30,697
Rym: Like what's the one that you're the most proud of?

405
00:21:30,797 --> 00:21:33,050
Rym: not maybe the most popular successful the one that you're proud?

406
00:21:33,314 --> 00:21:34,368
Guest: It's definitely not the most popular.

407
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:35,711
Guest: Successful.

408
00:21:35,732 --> 00:21:36,434
Guest: a free market.

409
00:21:36,775 --> 00:21:37,337
Scott: Oh, no.

410
00:21:37,478 --> 00:21:38,722
Rym: Yeah, I really like free mark.

411
00:21:38,783 --> 00:21:45,989
Rym: I really like free market - The only problem I have with it is that most people only ever experience it as a one-off at a con.

412
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:50,010
Rym: Yeah, and I feel like advancing the characters is 80% of what I love about that game.

413
00:21:50,211 --> 00:21:51,037
Guest: It's it's awesome.

414
00:21:51,077 --> 00:21:52,950
Guest: The character advancement system is awesome.

415
00:21:53,473 --> 00:21:53,593
Rym: What.

416
00:21:53,633 --> 00:21:55,824
Rym: so what do we do to get people to have that experience?

417
00:21:55,845 --> 00:21:56,910
Rym: because no one gets that at cons.

418
00:21:57,011 --> 00:21:58,840
Rym: I think that's the only reason free market isn't like.

419
00:21:58,981 --> 00:21:59,604
Rym: maybe you could do.

420
00:21:59,624 --> 00:22:07,747
Rym: maybe you could just do like instead of playing for the cam Make a cam of free market like an official place where you can log your characters.

421
00:22:08,149 --> 00:22:10,637
Scott: No I'm saying is we should do?

422
00:22:10,677 --> 00:22:12,690
Scott: is instead of playing for four hours, right?

423
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:13,091
Scott: We should do.

424
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:26,309
Scott: is you make the characters in one hour and then end the session every hour so that you get to Experience points on the yeah, I think if I ever do free market demos I'll split the session into two parts so people can see how the you know.

425
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:36,310
Scott: Yeah I'm thinking about doing that because the reason I want to do that is because something I learned Running free market at burning apocalypse con is that when the players actually know how it works, right?

426
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,919
Scott: Cuz I play the game I played in.

427
00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:39,850
Scott: we actually knew how to how to work it, right?

428
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:42,861
Scott: And we basically said it's one session burn everything, right?

429
00:22:42,981 --> 00:22:50,250
Scott: All right, we just set all our shit on fire and dominated And the first thing we did in the game was make level 3 tech for everybody.

430
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:52,210
Scott: So we're like, all right, everyone set it on fire for the rest of the yeah.

431
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,367
Guest: I think that that was what if that was a bullshit rule, by the way, right?

432
00:22:56,052 --> 00:22:56,955
Scott: We should have only had one.

433
00:22:56,975 --> 00:23:00,770
Guest: you should have one two at the most tied right or three level ones.

434
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:05,781
Scott: but the point is is that we You know, we could have just done the challenge four times.

435
00:23:05,822 --> 00:23:06,947
Scott: It would have been the same thing, right?

436
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:14,130
Scott: But we you know when you're not gonna go into the next session, you don't care about destroying your stuff, right?

437
00:23:14,391 --> 00:23:15,257
Scott: So you can easily.

438
00:23:15,277 --> 00:23:17,370
Scott: you can easily win if you just get rid of all your items.

439
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:22,816
Guest: Okay, well the answer to that is just if I was the I haven't done this yet Cuz it'd be a real dick thing to do.

440
00:23:22,856 --> 00:23:27,592
Guest: but just have the the NPC super super user User characters.

441
00:23:28,054 --> 00:23:28,856
Guest: what the hell are they called?

442
00:23:28,876 --> 00:23:29,197
Guest: I don't know.

443
00:23:29,317 --> 00:23:34,494
Guest: Yeah, but the you know, the super user control characters have them burn out stuff Like.

444
00:23:34,655 --> 00:23:36,646
Guest: I have tons of tech that's not even written down.

445
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:37,430
Guest: I'm just gonna burn it.

446
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,239
Scott: That's one thing that I always have trouble with.

447
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,270
Scott: is like when you're the super user, right?

448
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:43,104
Scott: It's like how you know, what can I act?

449
00:23:43,124 --> 00:23:43,810
Scott: do I have gene line?

450
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:44,816
Scott: I'm the super.

451
00:23:44,836 --> 00:23:45,502
Guest: you do have gene line.

452
00:23:45,543 --> 00:23:46,229
Scott: sometimes you do it.

453
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:49,648
Scott: Sometimes it's a specific like if you're doing a certain kind of challenge, right you have two and two.

454
00:23:49,668 --> 00:23:51,878
Guest: Yeah Here's what you have access to against yourself.

455
00:23:51,998 --> 00:23:53,866
Scott: You're used to use the other guy's character sheet, right?

456
00:23:54,147 --> 00:23:55,734
Scott: Oh, it's thin slicing It's against yourself.

457
00:23:55,814 --> 00:23:56,919
Scott: I'll just use whatever's on your sheet.

458
00:23:56,939 --> 00:23:57,481
Scott: You got gene line.

459
00:23:57,501 --> 00:24:00,733
Scott: I have it too, but sometimes it's like What do I have?

460
00:24:01,235 --> 00:24:01,878
Guest: Well, there's there's.

461
00:24:01,918 --> 00:24:04,730
Guest: I mean you do the little card drawing thing to it to generate the NPC.

462
00:24:05,011 --> 00:24:07,200
Guest: So sometimes you have tech and you know, you can burn it.

463
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,285
Scott: Yeah, I got it.

464
00:24:08,345 --> 00:24:09,450
Scott: I always keep forgetting to do that.

465
00:24:10,013 --> 00:24:10,736
Scott: Do the card drawing.

466
00:24:10,917 --> 00:24:13,129
Guest: the whole printing thing though when you were printing was a bowling ball.

467
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:15,356
Guest: Yeah, because I overheard your game cheating.

468
00:24:15,396 --> 00:24:20,954
Guest: So the idea with printing is we kind of looked at rapid prototyping right now and just said Future.

469
00:24:21,115 --> 00:24:24,250
Guest: so it's not like I print a billion marbles.

470
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,877
Guest: It's you print one perfect marble because it's.

471
00:24:27,018 --> 00:24:29,003
Guest: it's not made to produce mass-produced stuff.

472
00:24:29,043 --> 00:24:34,141
Guest: It's made to rapidly produce one thing cultivation is what you'd want if you want a million marbles.

473
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:40,240
Guest: because you just set up like a little face a factory and But you couldn't print a factory you'd have to print.

474
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,526
Guest: you could print a factory that would help you print.

475
00:24:42,786 --> 00:24:44,170
Guest: cultivate marbles.

476
00:24:44,653 --> 00:24:45,599
Scott: Okay, I got you.

477
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,768
Guest: you print one factory.

478
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:50,010
Guest: People are always like oh, why don't you just make another space station?

479
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:51,135
Guest: I'm like you got.

480
00:24:51,155 --> 00:24:53,448
Guest: you can't print the space where the matter come from.

481
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,236
Scott: The matter is not a problem.

482
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:01,270
Guest: It's just the the space like where you're gonna store these giant girders.

483
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:04,110
Guest: The problem is you'd have to do it like piece by piece by piece.

484
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:05,214
Guest: It would take away.

485
00:25:05,234 --> 00:25:06,258
Guest: you could totally do it you could.

486
00:25:06,499 --> 00:25:09,230
Guest: it's like the the with the maker bot reproducing itself.

487
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:11,664
Guest: It doesn't reproduce a maker about it reproduces all the parts.

488
00:25:11,724 --> 00:25:12,790
Scott: And what about see the problem?

489
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:15,710
Scott: I've always thought of is, you know, it's like well, why don't you go out into space?

490
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,360
Scott: I'm like if you got into space you can't get back in.

491
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,347
Scott: Yeah, you left.

492
00:25:18,448 --> 00:25:18,750
Scott: Yeah, right.

493
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:21,188
Scott: So it's like, okay, we're gonna build a space station outside.

494
00:25:21,229 --> 00:25:25,027
Scott: Okay Well, the first guy brings a girder out and he won't get back in to print the second.

495
00:25:25,047 --> 00:25:25,690
Guest: You'd have drones.

496
00:25:28,213 --> 00:25:29,057
Rym: Well, that can be a goal.

497
00:25:29,077 --> 00:25:31,429
Guest: I mean, yeah, you could totally do that in the game.

498
00:25:31,912 --> 00:25:35,152
Rym: Like it's just it sets up the end game really well Cuz the first.

499
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:40,370
Scott: every time I would just laugh because the players wouldn't think of the drones like you did and someone would go outside of the space station.

500
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:40,711
Scott: I'd be like.

501
00:25:40,852 --> 00:25:45,210
Rym: the first thing the characters always ask like when I'm talking about the game is could I fucking blow up the space?

502
00:25:48,032 --> 00:26:00,069
Guest: When we were developing this game one of one of the the guys because we worked with Hidden City To develop free market originally and one of the guys who worked there was like well What's to prevent me from making like a rapist murder sociopath?

503
00:26:00,652 --> 00:26:03,545
Guest: And I said do you want to play him rapist murder sociopath?

504
00:26:03,565 --> 00:26:07,569
Guest: and he's like, no I said well That's what's stopping you your own desire.

505
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:09,434
Guest: But somebody could.

506
00:26:09,454 --> 00:26:10,678
Guest: I'm like, yeah somebody could.

507
00:26:11,019 --> 00:26:11,461
Guest: so far.

508
00:26:11,541 --> 00:26:12,264
Guest: Nobody has.

509
00:26:12,806 --> 00:26:14,110
Guest: we've had some weird characters.

510
00:26:14,231 --> 00:26:16,766
Guest: We've had some characters who were definitely not social.

511
00:26:17,755 --> 00:26:19,084
Scott: Was the closest you've come to?

512
00:26:19,447 --> 00:26:19,769
Scott: rape is?

513
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:23,679
Scott: Closest the closest that you've seen.

514
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,365
Guest: the closest game was the group.

515
00:26:25,526 --> 00:26:26,590
Guest: That was essentially.

516
00:26:27,874 --> 00:26:28,897
Guest: They were a cult.

517
00:26:28,977 --> 00:26:30,181
Guest: that were cannibals.

518
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:33,230
Guest: they had a religious cult that that dealt with eating people.

519
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:34,334
Scott: That's close to what we had.

520
00:26:34,374 --> 00:26:38,250
Guest: and they got a ballerina to cut off her feet and eat them.

521
00:26:38,511 --> 00:26:39,884
Guest: Whoa, that was a pretty dark game.

522
00:26:40,005 --> 00:26:40,570
Scott: That was okay.

523
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:42,217
Scott: So we did see we did.

524
00:26:42,257 --> 00:26:45,430
Rym: is why is it always food like the majority of persons I've ever seen our food?

525
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:48,198
Guest: Well, I the thing that people need I have in the.

526
00:26:48,318 --> 00:26:51,287
Scott: when we played at the first burning con they did.

527
00:26:51,307 --> 00:26:52,170
Scott: it was similar.

528
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:54,903
Scott: It was cannibalism, but it was like gourmet cannibalism.

529
00:26:54,963 --> 00:26:56,310
Scott: eating yourself is so cool.

530
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,335
Scott: It's transgressive.

531
00:26:57,395 --> 00:27:00,310
Guest: It's one you can do it because there's no laws against it, too.

532
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:04,430
Guest: It's it's you're physically capable of doing it because you can regrow parts or grow parts.

533
00:27:04,732 --> 00:27:13,300
Scott: We're doing a cooking show and they got this girl like cutter you know hands off into the pot so they can cook it and serve it up to everyone and then the Aggregates are repairing your hand.

534
00:27:13,662 --> 00:27:16,272
Scott: Yeah, it's like it's Sure.

535
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:28,004
Guest: I mean if you lived in the society, you could have a cannibal gourmet cookery show Sure, and some people are like hey since you can't do that now and there's no way to do that in other role-playing games Let's do that, which is perfectly understandable.

536
00:27:28,225 --> 00:27:33,697
Guest: when I play D&D I want to kill orcs and dragons because I rarely get a chance to do that in real life Because you know, I live in the city.

537
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:40,786
Rym: I feel like this gives free markets and dragons in the city They're just underground Gators and the rats but it gives free market an opportunity to.

538
00:27:40,846 --> 00:27:56,200
Rym: I think just not disturb but like unnerve people when they like they play and I think every player can kind of get to this moment or They kind of realize that Social strictures maybe don't make sense or that maybe there is no absolute morality And I think it can put people into an interesting state of mind.

539
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:01,017
Guest: I played one game where they met The the game it it got.

540
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:04,190
Guest: it was kind of comical and there was bees in an opera house and it was really light-hearted.

541
00:28:04,371 --> 00:28:13,130
Guest: And then it got real dark real quick and it involved This woman's grandfather contacting her from the hole which is the the hub the center of the donut.

542
00:28:13,632 --> 00:28:16,628
Guest: I'm the center of the space station saying I'm here pick me up.

543
00:28:17,713 --> 00:28:19,864
Guest: And she's like Mike again and her grandfather was.

544
00:28:20,024 --> 00:28:20,949
Guest: her grandfather was dead.

545
00:28:21,411 --> 00:28:25,428
Guest: She had a memory of her father from her grandfather from Earth and she's like, where's my grandfather doing?

546
00:28:25,448 --> 00:28:26,775
Guest: He's dead He what.

547
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:31,033
Guest: so she goes there and he's there waiting for And she's like.

548
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:35,848
Guest: and he says you're my granddaughter, right and she's like, I'm really confused.

549
00:28:35,888 --> 00:28:36,370
Guest: what's going on?

550
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:40,890
Guest: It turns out that some hacker on the space station was just messing with people.

551
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:43,429
Guest: He's a switcher and he was a hacker and he made this blank.

552
00:28:44,031 --> 00:28:46,017
Guest: He got genetic material was able to reproduce.

553
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:50,208
Guest: her grandfather gave him some false memories and let him loose.

554
00:28:50,549 --> 00:28:52,056
Guest: and she's like Why did you do that?

555
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:54,349
Guest: He's like, I wanted to see what he'd do and I wanted to see what you do.

556
00:28:54,811 --> 00:28:56,298
Guest: And she's like, well, what is he gonna do now?

557
00:28:56,358 --> 00:28:58,367
Guest: And he says that's not up to me.

558
00:28:58,407 --> 00:28:58,950
Guest: He's a person.

559
00:28:59,551 --> 00:29:09,327
Guest: Yeah, he has his own free will and she's looking at him like Like those two things like you built this person to play a prank on me but I'm not responsible for him because he's his own person.

560
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:20,619
Guest: like There's a moment in the game Which we don't specifically talk about but if you if you kind of put the pieces together It's clear that blanks are technology.

561
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:24,228
Guest: up to a certain point blanks for those people don't know are essentially.

562
00:29:24,248 --> 00:29:25,130
Guest: they're like replicants.

563
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:26,114
Guest: They're created humans.

564
00:29:26,155 --> 00:29:26,657
Guest: They're they're.

565
00:29:26,878 --> 00:29:27,420
Guest: they're printed.

566
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:35,660
Guest: They're not actually born or or grown they're they're just output on a matter printer using cells instead of you know, carbon or metal or plastic.

567
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:43,910
Guest: and at a certain point They go from being tech to being a user on the space station and we never say what?

568
00:29:44,451 --> 00:29:46,409
Guest: You need to do to actually create a blank?

569
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:50,202
Scott: I always thought it was just a printing challenge.

570
00:29:50,644 --> 00:29:51,327
Scott: It's a blank.

571
00:29:51,387 --> 00:29:51,870
Scott: It's a really.

572
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:55,205
Guest: There's three parts of it.

573
00:29:55,245 --> 00:30:00,204
Guest: there's First you have to print the body right or cultivate the body.

574
00:30:00,264 --> 00:30:01,188
Guest: I guess gross gross.

575
00:30:05,832 --> 00:30:06,494
Guest: You need data.

576
00:30:06,574 --> 00:30:08,942
Guest: you need nine points of data, I think you can steal.

577
00:30:09,123 --> 00:30:11,210
Scott: you can donate memories, right the people, right?

578
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:12,428
Guest: You have to fill it full of memories.

579
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:20,235
Guest: You I have to fill it full and enough memory so I can upgrade those into skills so that it's not just the needs at Least an experience.

580
00:30:20,315 --> 00:30:26,553
Guest: It needs a couple experience at least and it needs interface.

581
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:34,828
Guest: it needs a key to be recognized by the So that's that's a mob challenge and I was like, oh wait it needs one needs a mobbing challenge.

582
00:30:36,991 --> 00:30:42,189
Guest: Yeah, so we never we kind of gloss over because we just want to see what people do because we're not we're not sure.

583
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:52,900
Guest: but yeah, there's that uncomfortable moment when somebody realizes one that My favorite one of my favorite reviews of the game was this game's broken because you should just play a blank because they have three Gene line, it's the only thing you can't improve.

584
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,027
Guest: Why would you take anything else?

585
00:30:54,088 --> 00:30:57,489
Guest: I'm like Yeah, why would you play anything else than a blank?

586
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,939
Guest: like eventually Wouldn't everybody on the space station be a blank?

587
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:08,458
Guest: because eventually people would just I mean if they're the superior being That we created wouldn't they surpass us?

588
00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:11,930
Rym: Isn't that kind of welcome to the plot of the majority of anime that we like?

589
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:15,800
Scott: Points you get your gene line, which you can't increase.

590
00:31:16,242 --> 00:31:20,356
Scott: experience which you can write Technology, which you can.

591
00:31:20,376 --> 00:31:21,704
Scott: and what's the other one?

592
00:31:22,348 --> 00:31:22,670
Guest: interface?

593
00:31:23,881 --> 00:31:25,414
Guest: Yeah Gene line.

594
00:31:25,435 --> 00:31:29,466
Guest: if you have a gene line three, you can't level up You can't you can't ever improve that.

595
00:31:29,486 --> 00:31:29,910
Scott: thought about it.

596
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:34,792
Guest: And if your gene line - you can't ever increase the three you can you can decrease down to one but wouldn't like You know.

597
00:31:34,873 --> 00:31:41,176
Scott: third fourth gen, you know non Blanks have No quids came around.

598
00:31:41,276 --> 00:31:46,810
Guest: quids are quids which are the kids the children of the second gen the little crazy little geniuses.

599
00:31:47,131 --> 00:31:49,239
Guest: They're gene line - oh, they're human.

600
00:31:49,339 --> 00:31:51,929
Scott: They've been right, but it waited long enough like six sevens.

601
00:31:52,431 --> 00:31:59,335
Guest: maybe they would know because you because the ideas of blank is a perfect gene line because you've Designed it specific for.

602
00:31:59,596 --> 00:32:05,073
Scott: so they're not, you know, so there's not you know, really genetically engineering the the natural babies There is.

603
00:32:05,113 --> 00:32:06,520
Guest: that's why they have a - not a one.

604
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,429
Guest: immigrants and first-gen have a one, right?

605
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:10,696
Guest: Because they're alive.

606
00:32:10,978 --> 00:32:12,850
Scott: about your games like actually becoming serious.

607
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,055
Scott: I have a really hard time.

608
00:32:14,075 --> 00:32:19,445
Scott: every game I play in or run always ends up silly in some way It's very silly world.

609
00:32:19,566 --> 00:32:20,110
Guest: It's a crazy.

610
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:23,650
Guest: I mean if you lived in that world, it would be silly but it would also kind of be horrifying.

611
00:32:23,891 --> 00:32:24,413
Guest: It was also.

612
00:32:24,533 --> 00:32:25,858
Guest: it would also be kind of amazing.

613
00:32:25,938 --> 00:32:27,203
Scott: I can't seem to bring out the horror.

614
00:32:27,223 --> 00:32:28,508
Scott: Maybe it's my fault.

615
00:32:28,849 --> 00:32:35,876
Guest: probably I think it eventually will come when when people realize what's at stake You also haven't run a campaign.

616
00:32:35,896 --> 00:32:37,122
Rym: That's true a game over maybe.

617
00:32:37,162 --> 00:32:40,870
Scott: maybe if as you get more sessions the heart You know would be easier to get away from the silliness.

618
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:45,590
Rym: Maybe when the players start to get to the point where they can do big things big things have big consequences.

619
00:32:45,772 --> 00:32:48,352
Rym: Yeah, big consequences lead to big Revelations.

620
00:32:48,513 --> 00:32:49,899
Scott: Oh, can I have another pad of character sheets?

621
00:32:49,979 --> 00:32:50,923
Scott: I'm I'm out.

622
00:32:51,144 --> 00:32:54,715
Guest: I am all out - I Wish I want extra cards.

623
00:32:54,775 --> 00:32:57,065
Scott: I'm like, you know, I'll trade you a deck of cards.

624
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:58,350
Guest: No, I don't have any more characters.

625
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,350
Rym: She said just a poor guy to kind of arguing with Luke.

626
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,478
Rym: He was like, what if there's no more like?

627
00:33:02,518 --> 00:33:03,561
Rym: what if I lose my deck?

628
00:33:03,682 --> 00:33:07,358
Rym: and like you're both dead and there's no more free Market, like this is a pretty sight.

629
00:33:07,378 --> 00:33:07,881
Scott: and print him out.

630
00:33:07,921 --> 00:33:09,290
Guest: This is a pre scarcity game.

631
00:33:09,531 --> 00:33:11,637
Guest: Yeah about post scarcity economy.

632
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,708
Guest: print one out or pre post scarcity.

633
00:33:15,049 --> 00:33:16,932
Scott: Yeah All right.

634
00:33:16,952 --> 00:33:21,669
Rym: So let's talk about some of your other games since you want to you know, like, you know lacuna all this old stuff.

635
00:33:22,472 --> 00:33:23,295
Rym: Does anyone play lacuna?

636
00:33:23,336 --> 00:33:24,460
Rym: I mean we play a bunch of times.

637
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,270
Guest: Yeah, I get lots of actual play reports and people.

638
00:33:27,652 --> 00:33:27,893
Guest: I still.

639
00:33:27,913 --> 00:33:30,966
Guest: I just sent one off in the mail yesterday to somebody in England.

640
00:33:31,066 --> 00:33:43,557
Rym: All right, nice Because as an aside someone gave me a copy of lacuna to get you to sign Three packs as ago and I said I've turned and said, okay How should I give it back to you?

641
00:33:43,577 --> 00:33:45,990
Rym: and the person already like ran away and I never found them.

642
00:33:47,232 --> 00:33:48,584
Guest: Remember that I signed it though, right?

643
00:33:48,645 --> 00:33:49,210
Scott: I've still got it.

644
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:50,938
Scott: Yeah, you're that guy and you're listening.

645
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:53,208
Scott: or if you're just someone who wants to get a free copy.

646
00:33:53,248 --> 00:33:56,570
Scott: lacuna If you if you are that side free sign copy.

647
00:33:56,691 --> 00:33:58,910
Rym: I remember enough about you to figure out if it's you or not.

648
00:33:59,051 --> 00:34:01,749
Scott: So I think it was a guy from a podcast maybe or something.

649
00:34:03,172 --> 00:34:04,826
Guest: It was either a guy or a girl.

650
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:06,693
Guest: Narrows it down.

651
00:34:06,954 --> 00:34:09,784
Rym: At least it wasn't one of those genderless pygmies from the burning wheel game.

652
00:34:09,824 --> 00:34:15,606
Scott: I ran it to BAC hmm, so so let's talk about like just you know, what are you doing lately?

653
00:34:15,706 --> 00:34:19,239
Scott: playing any games or Listen any music's watching movies.

654
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,710
Scott: What's cool for you right now for me?

655
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:32,616
Guest: I'm spending a lot of time working on Z Ward and I have a lacuna - It's for real I've been working.

656
00:34:32,656 --> 00:34:33,880
Scott: return of the spider-man what's?

657
00:34:34,081 --> 00:34:34,462
Guest: no it's.

658
00:34:34,663 --> 00:34:35,585
Guest: it's actually a sort.

659
00:34:35,626 --> 00:34:44,536
Guest: it's a not a standalone game it's a source book and it's um, the idea is it's a collection of People places and things in blue city.

660
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:47,108
Guest: So it's kind of like a little travelogue of blue city.

661
00:34:48,291 --> 00:34:54,565
Guest: But it's specifically because I didn't want to just do Because blue city the whole idea of it is you don't know what's in it.

662
00:34:54,585 --> 00:34:54,947
Scott: There's no set.

663
00:34:56,592 --> 00:34:58,361
Guest: So I was like, well, it's gonna be lame to do a source book.

664
00:34:58,481 --> 00:35:00,310
Guest: So I need to do something interesting with it.

665
00:35:00,632 --> 00:35:07,290
Guest: So what I did is I did 26 Originally 26 locations and they're all tramps the tram stops of the the train.

666
00:35:08,014 --> 00:35:20,529
Guest: so each and they're all you know the ones that are from the game like boxer and diamond and abattoir and cafe and all the stuff from the original game book and then a whole bunch of new ones and Each is like a page of information about stuff going on in that area.

667
00:35:20,549 --> 00:35:27,570
Guest: and The idea is there's a corresponding map tile that will go with each tram stop and during the game.

668
00:35:28,172 --> 00:35:31,605
Guest: What you'll do is you start with cafe station because that's most of the time that's where you.

669
00:35:31,966 --> 00:35:44,866
Guest: you enter the world on when you dive into blue city and Then when you want to take the tram or go to another area the the GM will just grab another tile at random Put it face face up and say that's all I get to.

670
00:35:44,986 --> 00:35:45,830
Rym: you know, whatever station.

671
00:35:45,991 --> 00:35:48,029
Rym: Well, you don't know how long that's gonna take you.

672
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:54,361
Scott: It's a little bit like those Like the newer D&D dungeon crawlies like the Raven loft.

673
00:35:54,382 --> 00:35:56,470
Scott: you flip the tile to make the next room.

674
00:35:56,490 --> 00:36:02,082
Guest: Yeah, as opposed to having a map that's or definitely inspired by stuff like that I played a lot of Raven loft and you know a shard along.

675
00:36:02,242 --> 00:36:05,354
Scott: I played the Raven loft once I was like It's not my style.

676
00:36:05,916 --> 00:36:07,242
Rym: Yeah, I'm not into those games.

677
00:36:07,262 --> 00:36:08,949
Rym: So I want to make a game that's like that.

678
00:36:09,672 --> 00:36:10,856
Rym: Yeah, we talked about this with Luke.

679
00:36:10,876 --> 00:36:11,397
Rym: So yes.

680
00:36:11,779 --> 00:36:11,999
Guest: Yes.

681
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:12,702
Guest: I'm aware of this.

682
00:36:12,722 --> 00:36:16,588
Guest: Yeah, I Hear about this all the time.

683
00:36:18,311 --> 00:36:28,347
Guest: But yeah, so I don't want to you know kickstart that I also want to put in a lot of um There's a lot of Easter eggs about because you know You need to explain a little bit what the hell's go actually going on in blue city because I know.

684
00:36:29,791 --> 00:36:31,618
Guest: So I figured I might share a little bit of that.

685
00:36:31,658 --> 00:36:33,505
Guest: So there's little you can't.

686
00:36:33,665 --> 00:36:45,821
Rym: you can't figure out the mystery Just you know from the book, but it definitely gives you some interesting Like the idea of no one knowing but you because everyone I play a game with They always came up with what the mystery really is.

687
00:36:45,841 --> 00:36:47,810
Rym: Yeah, it's always very similar.

688
00:36:47,891 --> 00:36:49,923
Rym: But then like every twist is different.

689
00:36:49,984 --> 00:36:50,869
Guest: Everybody thinks they're right.

690
00:36:51,451 --> 00:36:57,290
Scott: I mean, there's the one thing about one of the like mystery agents like the higher-up ones, right?

691
00:36:57,390 --> 00:37:03,360
Scott: Like there's the list of them in the book like the break agents and it's like you sort of see him in the background Of the double static right minor agent.

692
00:37:03,381 --> 00:37:04,990
Scott: my eyes, you know that Sun up with him.

693
00:37:06,071 --> 00:37:08,361
Guest: Nobody asked nobody actually no one person asked me.

694
00:37:08,442 --> 00:37:09,466
Guest: So where is agent minor?

695
00:37:09,667 --> 00:37:10,290
Guest: And I said, what do you mean?

696
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:14,370
Guest: He's like, well, they said he's a wall, but where's his body?

697
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:23,339
Scott: Right, and I'm like, you're the first person asked me sort of the obvious twist which is like the mystery agents used to be the Criminals and they got cleaned.

698
00:37:23,379 --> 00:37:27,440
Scott: now that the mystery that is never said in the book I know it's not said in the but every day master does that.

699
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:33,163
Scott: I know if you've read if you actually look read the book Slowly and carefully you had to be a moron not to at least come to that conclusion.

700
00:37:33,183 --> 00:37:36,775
Scott: whether it's true or not, you know You could come to that.

701
00:37:36,795 --> 00:37:40,230
Rym: conclude like the face Jared is making Scott while he's saying all this.

702
00:37:41,451 --> 00:37:44,867
Scott: But you know, but other than that, it's like there is still plenty of mystery like this.

703
00:37:44,907 --> 00:37:45,490
Scott: spider-man.

704
00:37:45,771 --> 00:37:46,595
Scott: What the fuck are they?

705
00:37:46,856 --> 00:37:50,050
Scott: they they're the guys who come at you late in the game when your statics too high.

706
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:51,274
Scott: What else what else are they?

707
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:51,716
Scott: I don't know.

708
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:53,081
Scott: They're spider-man.

709
00:37:53,483 --> 00:37:54,145
Scott: They're scary.

710
00:37:54,286 --> 00:37:55,470
Scott: They're on the cover of the book.

711
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:56,274
Scott: They must be important.

712
00:37:56,354 --> 00:37:57,359
Rym: I just get more interested.

713
00:37:57,379 --> 00:37:58,323
Rym: Like what is static like?

714
00:37:58,343 --> 00:37:59,810
Rym: they're trying to figure out what that means.

715
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:00,647
Scott: I have no idea.

716
00:38:02,619 --> 00:38:03,390
Rym: Could be ghost in the Shelly.

717
00:38:04,252 --> 00:38:06,350
Scott: It's a number that tells you how close the spider-man again.

718
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:11,182
Guest: Well static static was always in the game But it only had a stat and an actual purpose in the game.

719
00:38:11,343 --> 00:38:17,185
Guest: on the the second attempt and the first attempt It was just like okay be mean to the players and fuck with them and confuse them.

720
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:23,129
Guest: and now it's like, okay Be nice to the players until this number starts to go up and then slowly.

721
00:38:23,652 --> 00:38:25,605
Scott: Well, I think that's the magic which I like.

722
00:38:25,645 --> 00:38:26,410
Scott: that game works.

723
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:27,093
Scott: So well is.

724
00:38:27,134 --> 00:38:30,350
Scott: not only do you have that but it's it controls the pacing, right?

725
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:38,943
Scott: so if you well the heart rate and static both control pacing, so if you Even if the GM knows nothing about good pacing the game the numbers are just right.

726
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,950
Scott: good pacing can't not happen unless you cheat.

727
00:38:41,334 --> 00:38:41,678
Rym: Well, look at.

728
00:38:41,718 --> 00:38:43,236
Rym: look at all the like RPGs We like.

729
00:38:43,257 --> 00:38:44,310
Rym: like burning wheel mouse guard.

730
00:38:44,411 --> 00:38:55,749
Rym: These games are all designed to control Who gets control of the scene and when and like in burning wheel people push for things like they want a challenging test to advance or they want a routine test and that pushes the story toward these ebbs and flows.

731
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:59,284
Rym: and Mouse guard is the system of checks like earning checks.

732
00:38:59,324 --> 00:39:00,830
Rym: right fucking myself, right?

733
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:04,850
Guest: Now is the point in the game where things get really complicated because I want two checks instead of one.

734
00:39:04,991 --> 00:39:06,289
Guest: So I'm gonna you know break the tie-in.

735
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:12,728
Rym: I've never seen a mouse guard game where a player uses a check against them and the entire rest of the table doesn't go.

736
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:17,588
Guest: no Yeah, well you don't need those two dice.

737
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:21,129
Guest: They're probably gonna roll ones anyway.

738
00:39:22,292 --> 00:39:23,708
Guest: So so yeah lacuna part two.

739
00:39:25,371 --> 00:39:27,743
Guest: I'm not sure when that's gonna come out 2012.

740
00:39:27,743 --> 00:39:29,310
Guest: I guess I've been busy with Z Ward.

741
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:35,522
Guest: I'm gonna kickstart it and one of the things I'm gonna do with the book It's gonna be a book a PDF and I want to do tiles.

742
00:39:35,562 --> 00:39:37,510
Guest: I want to do cool map tiles.

743
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:38,256
Scott: I want your tiles.

744
00:39:39,183 --> 00:39:40,090
Guest: I want to do really nice one.

745
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:48,465
Guest: So, you know as it I haven't worked at the details But the the deal is you know PDF downloads that you can print out yourself at the low levels and at the high levels.

746
00:39:48,907 --> 00:39:57,767
Guest: if I raise enough money I'll do really sweet, you know, I'd like to do like, you know Small world style cards chipboard with the linen cover stuff.

747
00:39:58,249 --> 00:40:02,185
Guest: nice Yeah, small world by the way, one of my favorite games small world's good.

748
00:40:02,205 --> 00:40:03,250
Scott: Have you played the underground?

749
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:03,892
Guest: I haven't.

750
00:40:03,912 --> 00:40:04,577
Scott: I want not either.

751
00:40:04,597 --> 00:40:06,430
Rym: Have you played the original Vinci?

752
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:10,165
Rym: No, because Vinci is kind of an abstracted version.

753
00:40:10,225 --> 00:40:10,949
Rym: That's really fun.

754
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:16,066
Rym: But the fundamental difference is that there's no restrictions on what can combine with what.

755
00:40:16,388 --> 00:40:17,090
Rym: it's just two things.

756
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:20,542
Rym: So you can have like crazy weird powers that don't sometimes cheat.

757
00:40:21,224 --> 00:40:22,268
Guest: well small world you don't.

758
00:40:22,288 --> 00:40:22,950
Guest: there's no restrictions.

759
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:28,803
Scott: there is in small world for example, there's race and ability in Vinci, oh you can have like.

760
00:40:28,863 --> 00:40:33,839
Rym: it's just a bag of Regeneration or like, you know medicine and barbarian.

761
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:43,330
Guest: Okay, so to be like in small world if you grab orcs in spirits There's no number of turns there's a number of victory points.

762
00:40:43,491 --> 00:40:45,629
Rym: Okay, anyone goes over that the game ends at the end of that turn.

763
00:40:45,973 --> 00:40:47,590
Rym: So you see this weird like posturing.

764
00:40:48,394 --> 00:40:51,149
Scott: You know in small world, it's like, you know, it's gonna end.

765
00:40:51,471 --> 00:40:56,290
Scott: So that means I know I should decline on this turn because you know I want to decline two turns before the end of the game.

766
00:40:56,310 --> 00:41:08,040
Scott: So I come back into the board the sec the turn before the last time unless you have whereas in Vinci I decline when I think we're three turns away from the end and somebody else Purposefully delays to bring in an extra turn.

767
00:41:08,361 --> 00:41:10,310
Scott: and now I have one low scoring turn in for them.

768
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:11,395
Scott: It's a high scoring turn.

769
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:14,229
Guest: So Vinci is the small world as like pandemic is to.

770
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,781
Scott: They're made by the same guy and basically Vinci.

771
00:41:18,841 --> 00:41:23,423
Scott: not only does it have some problems with it But it had a lot of misprints and the production quality was low.

772
00:41:23,684 --> 00:41:24,850
Scott: He really wanted to redo it.

773
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:27,722
Scott: He put the small world theme on it, which made it sell small world.

774
00:41:27,762 --> 00:41:29,770
Guest: I mean it's the game itself is beautiful.

775
00:41:32,691 --> 00:41:35,020
Scott: She's just colored in little googly tiles.

776
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,208
Rym: Yeah, I just I like the skeletons a lot.

777
00:41:37,309 --> 00:41:38,895
Guest: skeleton Hi, I just it's.

778
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:42,449
Rym: I like how the the fish men have like basically a fish bone.

779
00:41:42,469 --> 00:41:46,405
Guest: Yeah The icons are great like everything about the game is like the troll troll layers.

780
00:41:46,446 --> 00:41:47,430
Scott: Those are some my favorite.

781
00:41:48,653 --> 00:41:49,810
Guest: Yeah, the pieces are all real.

782
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:54,858
Guest: I like the fact that even the mountains even though I'm like when I first started playing them Like why are there mountain pieces at?

783
00:41:54,898 --> 00:41:55,884
Guest: the mountains are on the board?

784
00:41:55,944 --> 00:41:59,942
Rym: Yeah, and at first I thought oh It's because that way everything is tokenized but forests aren't.

785
00:42:00,023 --> 00:42:05,204
Rym: and that pissed me off for like an hour Mmm, like I was trying to figure out why and I couldn't and it really bothered me.

786
00:42:05,224 --> 00:42:07,533
Guest: Well, it's because the mountains are Tokens.

787
00:42:07,553 --> 00:42:10,426
Guest: they count as a you know, but forests count as defense.

788
00:42:11,049 --> 00:42:12,493
Guest: They don't Know.

789
00:42:12,896 --> 00:42:14,426
Rym: oh they did in Vinci see here.

790
00:42:14,446 --> 00:42:14,970
Scott: Here's the problem.

791
00:42:16,111 --> 00:42:16,633
Rym: Here's the problem.

792
00:42:16,673 --> 00:42:21,550
Rym: We had no Vinci inside and out and this game is very close to it.

793
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:25,970
Rym: It's like 99% but there are such tiny differences that we never know the answer at any specific question.

794
00:42:26,071 --> 00:42:28,649
Guest: Some of the forests have the like little magic gem for wizards.

795
00:42:29,731 --> 00:42:32,390
Rym: That's actually burning real gold and burning wheel revised.

796
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:40,070
Guest: I'm having the same problem like oh plus one and then everyone the tables like no I I do that when we do like when we were play testing free market or when I'm play testing.

797
00:42:41,053 --> 00:42:45,167
Guest: You know actually if I'm doing like and parsley game from memory and it hasn't actually come out yet.

798
00:42:45,308 --> 00:42:49,447
Guest: Sometimes I'm like Which which game which version of the game am I running right now?

799
00:42:53,162 --> 00:42:55,414
Guest: All right, so that's what's going on.

800
00:42:55,434 --> 00:42:56,198
Scott: Yeah, nice.

801
00:42:57,184 --> 00:43:04,560
Scott: So so wait, but you know, you see you're kick-starting, you know The Z Ward now and you're gonna kick start the lacuna - yep when it's ready like how you know.

802
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:09,960
Scott: Do you think like the Kickstarter well will dry up like, you know, how often can you kick start?

803
00:43:10,061 --> 00:43:10,465
Guest: I don't want to.

804
00:43:10,525 --> 00:43:10,909
Guest: I don't want to.

805
00:43:11,494 --> 00:43:12,100
Guest: I want to do one.

806
00:43:12,261 --> 00:43:13,044
Guest: I decided I'm gonna do.

807
00:43:13,084 --> 00:43:14,571
Scott: I would be worried about if I was kick start.

808
00:43:14,611 --> 00:43:22,076
Guest: Yeah, like I. well Kickstarter is awesome for for me right now for my my constraints that I'm dealing with.

809
00:43:23,442 --> 00:43:31,352
Guest: it's really good and it's also really cool because It's I mean, I've done pre-orders on parsley games before and it was like 30 people.

810
00:43:31,834 --> 00:43:32,135
Guest: Yay.

811
00:43:32,155 --> 00:43:33,499
Guest: I got 200 people.

812
00:43:35,306 --> 00:43:35,758
Guest: It's weird.

813
00:43:36,701 --> 00:43:38,166
Rym: There's a culture around Kickstarter.

814
00:43:38,206 --> 00:43:42,280
Guest: there's a culture adds to the momentum exactly and it's also a nice affirmation.

815
00:43:42,401 --> 00:43:44,855
Guest: I'm getting lots of emails from people saying yay.

816
00:43:44,895 --> 00:43:45,680
Guest: I love these games.

Rym: I'll say this, you know, we run the panels department at Kinetic Con workshops all that stuff.

00:43:55,161 --> 00:44:00,920
Rym: You guys you and Luke other than us are the most asked about people who come to the con?

820
00:44:01,321 --> 00:44:01,843

00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,019
Guest: Yes, you do have to.

00:44:50,593 --> 00:44:51,376
Guest: I'm interested.

845
00:44:51,396 --> 00:44:52,098
Guest: I totally.

00:44:52,118 --> 00:44:52,540
Rym: it's way fun.

847
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:57,360
Rym: I can't speak for getting you on panels or anything slowly for that, but there's a gaming intellectuals.

848
00:44:57,441 --> 00:45:00,440
Rym: We're part of the mag 9 like 9 gaming 9.

849
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,485
Scott: maybe the mags.

850
00:45:01,545 --> 00:45:02,689
Scott: first of all, it's the 10th mag.

851
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:05,180
Rym: Well one you and I together count as one person, right?

852
00:45:05,821 --> 00:45:06,666
Scott: So there's also.

853
00:45:06,766 --> 00:45:07,772
Scott: it's the 10th mag fest.

854
00:45:07,792 --> 00:45:09,120
Scott: So it would it be the mag 10 now?

855
00:45:09,441 --> 00:45:09,785
Scott: It was not.

856
00:45:09,825 --> 00:45:11,060
Scott: is it even 10 people anymore?

857
00:45:11,581 --> 00:45:13,432
Rym: I think it's like 11 people there's gonna be.

858
00:45:13,834 --> 00:45:14,700
Rym: we just got the list of it.

859
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:17,431
Rym: We're on to where I don't know if I'm allowed to say anything whatever.

860
00:45:17,893 --> 00:45:19,339
Rym: We're on to discussion.

861
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:19,480
Scott: temp.

862
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:20,767
Scott: We're tentatively on to.

863
00:45:20,787 --> 00:45:21,330
Scott: there you go.

864
00:45:21,732 --> 00:45:22,657
Rym: Well, we're definitely on to.

865
00:45:22,718 --> 00:45:23,040
Rym: I'm still.

866
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:26,780
Rym: no I would totally do it if I could get on panels and I'm saying I don't know if I can swing.

867
00:45:27,325 --> 00:45:32,078
Guest: Could if you could I'm just saying Let's table this and take it offline.

868
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:37,397
Rym: We can introduce you to the person who runs the stuff and he will probably want you to do stuff.

869
00:45:37,517 --> 00:45:46,265
Rym: and I'm sure Because it's a really open con like we were running like just burning wheel and mouse guard and like danger patrol games for people Just randomly the whole con.

870
00:45:46,708 --> 00:45:49,260
Rym: you could just walk into an open area start doing action castle.

871
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:52,560
Rym: You'd have a crowd of like a hundred within I know and no one would care.

872
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:55,724
Scott: It's not like packs of the enforcers to be like, excuse me Can you move?

873
00:45:55,865 --> 00:45:58,340
Guest: or origins where they just don't let you do it, right?

874
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:04,179
Rym: It people just be like whatever I mean, there's guys just like jamming on electric guitars like outside the hotel and no one cares.

875
00:46:05,401 --> 00:46:05,683
Scott: We'll see.

876
00:46:05,723 --> 00:46:07,752
Scott: maybe this hotel will be more stuffy than the last one.

877
00:46:08,094 --> 00:46:08,576
Rym: We'll see.

878
00:46:08,597 --> 00:46:12,794
Rym: also Better not fucking happen.

879
00:46:12,814 --> 00:46:16,829
Scott: Oh my god Is our friend coming back?

880
00:46:17,533 --> 00:46:17,855
Scott: John St.

881
00:46:17,876 --> 00:46:18,097
Scott: John.

882
00:46:20,085 --> 00:46:20,667
Rym: The John St.

883
00:46:20,687 --> 00:46:21,329
Rym: John will be there.

884
00:46:21,349 --> 00:46:22,352
Scott: This is a bigger hotel.

885
00:46:22,432 --> 00:46:24,660
Scott: So maybe he can break his hotel room party record.

886
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:27,063
Scott: We'll see.

887
00:46:27,687 --> 00:46:29,094
Rym: All right, I think we can wrap this up.

888
00:46:29,135 --> 00:46:34,934
Rym: So one last question What is the last movie that you've seen all the way through any movie?

889
00:46:34,954 --> 00:46:35,436
Rym: I'm just curious.

890
00:46:35,897 --> 00:46:47,820
Rym: Uh, that would have been Because I just jeopardy the movie because I just you know The the movie that M Night Shyamalan tried to make about Avatar that then he died that car accident.

891
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:48,442
Rym: They didn't finish.

892
00:46:48,482 --> 00:46:54,020
Rym: it may have said I'm Netflix streaming and I may have showed Emily why it was so bad.

893
00:46:54,803 --> 00:46:56,311
Scott: And I thought you saw that movie.

894
00:46:56,371 --> 00:46:58,341
Rym: I saw it all the way through the second worst movie I've.

895
00:46:58,361 --> 00:46:59,788
Scott: why did you watch it a second time?

896
00:46:59,808 --> 00:47:00,451
Rym: I didn't watch it.

897
00:47:00,572 --> 00:47:00,954
Rym: I flipped.

898
00:47:01,054 --> 00:47:02,220
Rym: I put two three scenes.

899
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:03,689
Rym: I showed her Fire.

900
00:47:03,729 --> 00:47:05,259
Rym: Lord Ozo is a chubby, dude.

901
00:47:06,541 --> 00:47:13,880
Rym: It's a bunch of white people living in the Arctic race bender, right who spends 15 minutes explaining backstory without showing you any.

902
00:47:14,881 --> 00:47:15,644
Rym: And what did I show?

903
00:47:15,724 --> 00:47:24,355
Rym: I showed her the scene where Katara runs across the entire wide screen Over the course of like three seconds to girlishly shove a guy nice.

904
00:47:24,556 --> 00:47:26,483
Rym: It's the worst scene at any movie I've ever seen.

905
00:47:27,207 --> 00:47:28,715
Guest: I saw a Halloween night.

906
00:47:28,775 --> 00:47:39,372
Guest: I saw a phantasm the original Which if you haven't seen it, it's very weird Scott's not up on a lot of the like those kinds of movies.

907
00:47:39,593 --> 00:47:41,541
Scott: I'm going through the IMDb top 250.

908
00:47:41,541 --> 00:47:43,148
Scott: I just watched Rebecca.

909
00:47:43,168 --> 00:47:45,880
Scott: So I'm almost done with page two top 250.

910
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:46,402
Rym: What's in there?

911
00:47:47,004 --> 00:47:50,635
Rym: a lot is the original house on Haunted Hill and or Vincent Price's.

912
00:47:50,936 --> 00:47:52,360
Rym: is any Vincent Price movie in there?

913
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,022
Scott: I have no idea.

914
00:47:53,564 --> 00:47:54,386
Scott: I haven't seen him yet.

915
00:47:54,406 --> 00:47:55,550
Scott: Then I'm on page two.

916
00:47:55,590 --> 00:47:56,574
Guest: Maybe Edward Scissorhands.

917
00:47:57,155 --> 00:47:57,958
Scott: I don't think that's on there.

918
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:01,970
Rym: really Have to guess it'd be up there.

919
00:48:02,030 --> 00:48:03,460
Rym: It was I like that movie.

920
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:11,046
Rym: Yeah, Tim Burton's movies that I do like plus it was When it came out, it was kind of like scared me Edgy and slightly controversial.

921
