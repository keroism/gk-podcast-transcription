1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,281
Rym: It's Wednesday March 15th, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:15,025
Rym: We talk about our favorite anime.

3
00:00:15,587 --> 00:00:16,610
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:17,372 --> 00:00:22,749
Rym: Well, I spent yet another morning down in Manhattan and it looks like I'm gonna have a new job sometime in the next month or so.

5
00:00:24,015 --> 00:00:25,284
Scott: Job, that's better than the one you got.

6
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:35,988
Rym: Oh significantly better in terms of paying at least $10,000 more a year and better benefits and Possibly regular travel to such places as Tokyo and London.

7
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:37,994
Scott: Regular travel, I think.

8
00:00:38,015 --> 00:00:39,179
Scott: what did you say once a year?

9
00:00:39,199 --> 00:00:40,545
Rym: Yeah once or twice a year.

10
00:00:40,565 --> 00:00:44,921
Scott: Yeah, we'll see It's not like zipping around the world awesomeness.

11
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:47,169
Rym: Hey go to Japan once for free is enough for me.

12
00:00:47,712 --> 00:00:50,610
Scott: Yeah, it's it's better than zero anyways, of course.

13
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:56,844
Rym: Honestly, if I go anywhere like that for business I'll totally take the print the next week after my business is done as vacation days and stay there.

14
00:00:56,864 --> 00:00:58,530
Rym: Yeah, it's a good move.

15
00:00:58,631 --> 00:00:59,255
Rym: That's the plan.

16
00:00:59,296 --> 00:01:00,847
Rym: then all I have to pay for is a hotel room.

17
00:01:01,732 --> 00:01:04,947
Rym: Yeah, maybe I'll sleep on the floor at katsu's family's house or something.

18
00:01:04,967 --> 00:01:13,807
Scott: Well I finally got my They the raise I was supposed to get like three month to a month and a half ago.

19
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:17,460
Scott: Ah But I think they messed up and gave me too much money.

20
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,797
Scott: Hopefully they're not listening, but that's okay As I got moneys.

21
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,450
Scott: Yeah, yeah money.

22
00:01:24,874 --> 00:01:31,889
Rym: So anyway in the news There's this dude and for some reason this decided to make it to the level of news where it was on Slashdot and all over the place.

23
00:01:32,452 --> 00:01:41,270
Rym: But some guy was playing World of Warcraft and he happened to be playing it on Linux in wine And he happened to be using a keyboard that allows you to make keyboard macros.

24
00:01:41,391 --> 00:01:43,726
Scott: And if he can get that to work in wine, all I want is steam.

25
00:01:43,746 --> 00:01:47,405
Scott: damn it Was he using the sedaga thing or is he using real wine?

26
00:01:47,426 --> 00:01:48,250
Rym: You know, I don't know.

27
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,183
Rym: I've never tried to make World of Warcraft run in wine.

28
00:01:50,224 --> 00:01:51,090
Rym: I don't know how hard it is.

29
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,070
Rym: Some things just work really easily in wine.

30
00:01:53,311 --> 00:01:56,330
Scott: I really just want steam to work in wine without paying for stupid.

31
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:04,790
Rym: Internet Explorer runs fine in wine, but not civilization - oh no Internet Explorer works better in wine than in Windows.

32
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,294
Rym: Yeah, it really does.

33
00:02:06,314 --> 00:02:06,876
Rym: Yep.

34
00:02:07,397 --> 00:02:12,010
Rym: But anyway this guy now the fact that he was using wine is not terribly relevant.

35
00:02:12,191 --> 00:02:15,210
Rym: All it did was expedite his banning from World of Warcraft.

36
00:02:15,652 --> 00:02:20,509
Rym: Basically, he programmed his keyboard to do repetitive tasks for him.

37
00:02:21,131 --> 00:02:25,686
Rym: So he hits the I don't know B, I think that fancy logitech gaming keyboard.

38
00:02:25,726 --> 00:02:28,595
Scott: the LCD display Yeah Where you can set up you can.

39
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:31,606
Scott: it has like extra buttons on it and you can program it.

40
00:02:31,647 --> 00:02:36,686
Scott: to say when I hit this Button do like a then B then F G and then up.

41
00:02:36,867 --> 00:02:37,650
Rym: Yeah, they're just macros.

42
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:43,402
Rym: So we made macros that would kill mobs for him in the game and he just kind of sit there tapping the button while they watch TV.

43
00:02:44,671 --> 00:02:50,846
Rym: well, he was sitting there doing that and apparently a GM noticed and Private message him saying hey you a bot.

44
00:02:51,487 --> 00:02:55,737
Rym: and because he didn't notice the PM they banned him from World of Warcraft for botting.

45
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:02,420
Rym: and His argument in his defense is that he wasn't botting he was using a macro keyboard and there's nothing wrong with that.

46
00:03:03,066 --> 00:03:04,319
Scott: I don't think there is anything wrong with that.

47
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:21,114
Rym: Well, here's the thing by the only reason I bring this up as news because one This guy sounds like a total douche the guy who's complaining because if you read the his complaints He basically says to the effect of I blah blah blah ISP I'm important blah blah blah blah and then he goes on and talks about his problem.

48
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:22,600
Rym: Like he makes a big deal about himself.

49
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:24,483
Scott: Well, see the real.

50
00:03:24,503 --> 00:03:27,171
Scott: I don't know why we keep having news about World of Warcraft.

51
00:03:27,211 --> 00:03:30,120
Rym: the thing we hate because it's fodder for entertainment.

52
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:33,093
Scott: Yeah, it is that get an epic talking about this news.

53
00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:45,019
Scott: That really bothers me is that This guy wrote somewhat intelligent emails compared to what most people write and the company like didn't even It's like companies don't communicate with people.

54
00:03:45,341 --> 00:03:52,538
Scott: It's like I hate it when you send a letter to a company and they don't actually read it and custom You know send you a response now.

55
00:03:52,921 --> 00:03:55,918
Rym: See I anticipated you would say that because I agreed with you at first.

56
00:03:56,701 --> 00:03:57,924
Rym: Until I actually read.

57
00:03:58,506 --> 00:04:05,217
Rym: he kept replying as far as I can tell to the do not reply to this or you will get an automated response email address.

58
00:04:07,844 --> 00:04:08,578
Rym: That's what I saw.

59
00:04:09,741 --> 00:04:10,624
Scott: No, it looked.

60
00:04:10,745 --> 00:04:11,327
Scott: it's like they were.

61
00:04:11,347 --> 00:04:18,793
Scott: they give you if you read the first email it says do not reply to this But you know like directly but they give you an address that you can email to.

62
00:04:19,276 --> 00:04:23,311
Scott: and then it looked like from then on He was talking to that email address that you're supposed to email.

63
00:04:23,652 --> 00:04:25,579
Rym: I'm going based on the comments from slashdot.

64
00:04:27,161 --> 00:04:28,788
Scott: Who knows what you can say about that?

65
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:34,154
Rym: Yeah, but anyway the point is here that more importantly I don't care that the guy was banned and it's probably good for him.

66
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:35,140
Rym: He'll probably get a life or so.

67
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,260
Scott: Oh, yeah, definitely great for him that he was banned.

68
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,051
Scott: I don't know why he's so.

69
00:04:38,132 --> 00:04:46,146
Scott: I mean you'd be upset because he spent all these hours to make some numbers go up and now the numbers are deleted in the database, but Good now he's gonna get a life.

70
00:04:46,868 --> 00:04:48,534
Scott: But the thing is he won't play another mo.

71
00:04:48,795 --> 00:04:53,808
Rym: apparently World of Warcraft Can be played by a keyboard without a person there.

72
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:55,914
Scott: Oh, yeah, so can every MMO.

73
00:04:56,175 --> 00:05:00,844
Rym: now now this is not some MMOs couldn't You.

74
00:05:00,864 --> 00:05:14,325
Rym: but anyway, the problem here to me is that if you're playing a game Against a computer that could be played just as well if not better by a computer as opposed to by you then Why even play?

75
00:05:14,726 --> 00:05:17,256
Rym: all you're doing is spending time to make a number go up.

76
00:05:17,658 --> 00:05:18,019
Rym: I don't get it.

77
00:05:18,381 --> 00:05:27,180
Scott: yeah, I mean think about if you're sitting there and there's a button and If you push the button a number goes up and all you have to do is push that button a whole bunch of times.

78
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:28,807
Scott: What what are you doing?

79
00:05:28,887 --> 00:05:30,493
Scott: sitting there pushing that button repeatedly?

80
00:05:30,514 --> 00:05:32,080
Scott: What the hell's the point if anything?

81
00:05:32,281 --> 00:05:41,088
Rym: I say you should be encouraged to write macros to get through that tedious crap because I'll admit way back when I played the realm You know that old ass MMO by Sierra.

82
00:05:41,469 --> 00:05:42,051
Rym: It's still around.

83
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:42,873
Rym: the fans bought it.

84
00:05:42,953 --> 00:05:51,459
Rym: It's kind of scary that it's still up, but Once I got past level 60 or 65, there was nothing else in the game to kill because the game wasn't done yet.

85
00:05:52,443 --> 00:05:56,920
Rym: And I wanted to be level 100, you know, because I was a middle school high school kid with infinite free time.

86
00:05:57,644 --> 00:06:07,852
Rym: Now instead of killing, you know Whatever's over and over again thousands and thousands of times a day hour after hour to get the one experience point I'd get to try to get myself up to a higher level.

87
00:06:07,873 --> 00:06:12,240
Rym: I Just wrote a little Windows macro that would attack any monster.

88
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,081
Rym: it saw well it would.

89
00:06:13,101 --> 00:06:16,718
Rym: you easily stand on a screen and attack any monster that walked into the middle of the screen and kill it.

90
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,554
Rym: because I Was so powerful nothing could hurt me and that way I didn't have to waste my time and I still got to level 100.

91
00:06:21,554 --> 00:06:26,920
Rym: I Don't see why people have a problem with other people using bots to level in a game.

92
00:06:27,904 --> 00:06:28,840
Rym: I don't need someone else.

93
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,580
Rym: I mean if you have fun gaining levels in the game and exploring all the new content fine.

94
00:06:33,161 --> 00:06:37,180
Rym: If someone else doesn't enjoy that I say that there should be no problem with them using a bot.

95
00:06:37,381 --> 00:06:39,730
Scott: My question is why are any people playing it at all?

96
00:06:39,991 --> 00:06:40,613
Scott: It just uh.

97
00:06:41,135 --> 00:06:42,400
Rym: now I can see how the game would be fun.

98
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:49,175
Rym: I mean I wouldn't mind playing the game if one I'd have to pay for it and Two if I could just pick whatever level I wanted to be play at that level.

99
00:06:49,195 --> 00:06:53,760
Rym: when I was done with that pick a different Level play at that part of the game and then when I played all the parts of the game just stop.

100
00:06:54,262 --> 00:06:55,869
Scott: Yeah, I mean like I wouldn't.

101
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:58,138
Scott: World of Warcraft was like a big world to explore some.

102
00:06:58,239 --> 00:07:00,820
Scott: you know Zelda's kind of fun when you're walking around exploring.

103
00:07:00,961 --> 00:07:06,907
Scott: So maybe if the whole game was I can go anywhere the hell I want and do anything I want and just see everything to see.

104
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:08,613
Scott: then I might do that once.

105
00:07:08,653 --> 00:07:13,236
Scott: it would take me a few hours and I'd walk around Or ride around and see everything there was to see.

106
00:07:13,256 --> 00:07:23,822
Rym: I mean honestly The only thing that bothers me about MMOs at least current MMOs at all Is just the fact that most of the game is just a grind to try to get to a higher level or get a higher Whatever.

107
00:07:24,364 --> 00:07:31,274
Rym: and the only factor in determining how good you are compared to another character The only factor at all is how much time you spent playing the game.

108
00:07:31,294 --> 00:07:32,760
Rym: There's no skill involved.

109
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:43,752
Scott: And if you say there's skill involved well, uh, you're wrong and I'll argue you till the end of time Yeah, Oh whoever spends the most time playing the game That means they're the best as opposed to whoever's the best is the best.

110
00:07:44,153 --> 00:07:46,079
Scott: I mean what if you know?

111
00:07:46,861 --> 00:07:59,989
Scott: It's like saying if one guy sucks at sword fighting But he practices for a hundred years and another guy happens to be a natural amazing sword fighter And he practices for ten minutes that the ten minute guy should never win Regardless of his natural talent.

112
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:01,235
Rym: now some MMOs handle that.

113
00:08:01,296 --> 00:08:02,140
Rym: look at puzzle pirates.

114
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:07,340
Rym: All right You've got puzzles that you do and say sword fighting is a versus Tetris II kind of puzzles.

115
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:14,020
Rym: Now if you're if you play the game, you know for years and years and years and you get really really good at that.

116
00:08:14,301 --> 00:08:15,367
Rym: That's the equivalent of leveling.

117
00:08:15,387 --> 00:08:17,699
Rym: you've gotten good in the real world at doing that thing.

118
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:24,817
Scott: Well, there are in sword fighting puzzles a bad example because there's actually swords that kind of change the pattern and make it difficult But not so much.

119
00:08:25,841 --> 00:08:28,630
Rym: All I was saying is that you can get better at it by practicing.

120
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:28,951
Rym: Yeah.

121
00:08:29,111 --> 00:08:29,272
Rym: Yeah.

122
00:08:29,452 --> 00:08:33,102
Rym: Yeah, so you effectively level in the real world Mm-hmm.

123
00:08:33,123 --> 00:08:41,879
Rym: Now if you just happen to be naturally good or say you start a new character now, you're level one again or whatever You're still just as good in the real world.

124
00:08:42,302 --> 00:08:48,546
Rym: So now your low-level new character is gonna be awesome just because you're awesome in World of Warcraft or anything.

125
00:08:48,887 --> 00:08:52,400
Rym: if you start a new level one character your character sucks ass because there's really.

126
00:08:52,842 --> 00:08:56,040
Rym: The only thing involved are the stats and the stats only get bigger by playing the game longer.

127
00:08:56,595 --> 00:09:03,440
Scott: Yeah Well, there is one thing is that if you played the game and you know your way around it It takes you less time to get the levels because you know, right?

128
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,863
Scott: That's the only thing.

129
00:09:04,923 --> 00:09:17,080
Scott: is it's like if you already know this arbitrary knowledge about this imaginary world Then it will take you less time To do these things because you already know what you're doing and the time it takes to figure it out is now already spent.

130
00:09:17,484 --> 00:09:18,920
Rym: It's like when I beat Zelda 2 again.

131
00:09:19,081 --> 00:09:20,005
Rym: I knew where everything was.

132
00:09:20,066 --> 00:09:22,880
Rym: I just went and got it and it saved me about 20 hours worth of gameplay.

133
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:35,355
Scott: It's like if you went to the store to buy a stick of gum, right and it costs five bucks for your first stick of Gum, but then every other stick of gum ever cost only one dollar because you've already paid the four dollar stick of gum entry fee Of learning how to chew gum and buy it.

134
00:09:36,923 --> 00:09:38,120
Rym: That was quite an example.

135
00:09:38,341 --> 00:09:44,079
Scott: I just had to make something up that was crazy because you got to be crazy to sit there and push a button over and Over again to make a number go anyway.

136
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:50,160
Rym: I guess the only thing I want to say about this is to all of our listeners out there Even though this is anime day, so I'm gonna come off it in a minute.

137
00:09:50,501 --> 00:09:54,460
Rym: But it's my news so you can all go to hell for anyone who plays World of Warcraft.

138
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:02,460
Rym: Why on earth can I'd like you to give me in the forums any reason why people botting should be against the rules?

139
00:10:04,584 --> 00:10:05,616
Rym: All right, that's all I want.

140
00:10:05,637 --> 00:10:09,045
Rym: I Submit that to you all as a challenge.

141
00:10:09,787 --> 00:10:14,200
Rym: And if someone gives me a good enough argument, I'll concede defeat and you'll win something.

142
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:20,162
Scott: If he says you're gonna win something that means you're not gonna win Argument.

143
00:10:20,464 --> 00:10:24,060
Rym: Well, I point out that no one won our previous mini contest.

144
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:27,920
Scott: No one seems to even try any of our thousands of contests for prizes.

145
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,558
Rym: Yeah, no one told me what the Duchy of Grand Fenwick was.

146
00:10:30,619 --> 00:10:39,610
Scott: yet I guess that means that everyone either doesn't know our trivia's and they can't stand up to our challenges because we're always right or they Don't realize that we actually do have a lot of money.

147
00:10:39,751 --> 00:10:42,442
Rym: and if someone actually came out with the awesome Yeah, hello.

148
00:10:42,482 --> 00:10:44,710
Scott: My company just paid me more money than they're supposed to.

149
00:10:44,971 --> 00:10:45,693
Scott: hello money.

150
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:46,837
Scott: You can have it.

151
00:10:46,857 --> 00:10:47,740
Scott: It could be yours.

152
00:10:47,941 --> 00:10:49,266
Rym: I don't think we're gonna give him money.

153
00:10:49,286 --> 00:10:50,570
Rym: I think we'll give him swag.

154
00:10:51,032 --> 00:11:00,813
Scott: Yeah, so today's anime manga comics day And since we got all anime for the main part of our show I gotta talk about some manga news and some comics news.

155
00:11:01,235 --> 00:11:02,500
Scott: Well, the manga is my thing of the day.

156
00:11:02,581 --> 00:11:04,018
Scott: So we'll stick the comics news here.

157
00:11:04,882 --> 00:11:13,613
Scott: You may or may not know but I bet that you know because I don't know movies and shit That's going on in the world and I know about this now.

158
00:11:13,653 --> 00:11:18,740
Rym: You may not know the guy's name Yeah, but if we tell you the things he's done you'll think oh that guy

159
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,422
Scott: Yeah, so

160
00:11:19,764 --> 00:11:21,169
Rym: and if you don't listen, well,

161
00:11:21,811 --> 00:11:38,549
Scott: so there's this movie coming out V for Vendetta And actually I have cautious optimism, which is more than I've had for any movie since probably Lord of the Rings and it's gonna have the Rogers not Roger Smith agent Smith.

162
00:11:39,215 --> 00:11:45,797
Scott: slash Elrond is going to be V and Natalie Portman is gonna be the girl.

163
00:11:46,601 --> 00:11:50,053
Rym: Now it surprises me to this day and it makes me feel old.

164
00:11:50,133 --> 00:11:51,879
Rym: How many people don't know who Natalie Portman is?

165
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:55,325
Scott: Remember the damn name.

166
00:11:55,667 --> 00:11:58,560
Scott: All I could remember was Star Wars chick and the professional chick.

167
00:11:58,881 --> 00:12:01,692
Rym: Yeah, I remember from the professional but slash dot.

168
00:12:02,174 --> 00:12:08,220
Rym: for any of you who are younger that I mean Younger than us even because this joke was old before we knew about slash dot.

169
00:12:08,822 --> 00:12:12,435
Rym: Natalie Portman has been this long-standing inside joke on slash dot.

170
00:12:12,495 --> 00:12:13,940
Rym: I don't even understand the inside joke.

171
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,040
Rym: It was before my time, but apparently all the nerds knew who she was.

172
00:12:18,281 --> 00:12:24,885
Scott: Yeah, she was in an awesome movie called the professional and then she was princess whatnot in Star Wars episode Princess whatnot.

173
00:12:25,186 --> 00:12:25,688
Scott: I don't know.

174
00:12:25,789 --> 00:12:26,230
Scott: What's her name?

175
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,616
Rym: Alright Gauri.

176
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:31,946
Scott: Okay, so The guy who wrote V for Vendetta.

177
00:12:32,006 --> 00:12:33,029
Scott: His name is Alan Moore.

178
00:12:33,069 --> 00:12:34,633
Scott: He's his British comic writer.

179
00:12:34,673 --> 00:12:35,094
Scott: Basically.

180
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,340
Rym: He's a scary-looking dude, but he's brilliant.

181
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,885
Scott: He looks like a Dane like you.

182
00:12:38,945 --> 00:12:44,080
Scott: read his stuff and you think he's just some like awesome British genius guy who writes awesome stuff.

183
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,557
Scott: But really he's actually scary biker with a Rasputin beard.

184
00:12:48,617 --> 00:12:49,340
Rym: He's Rasputin.

185
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:52,440
Rym: He must have survived and lived to this day in order to make comics.

186
00:12:52,962 --> 00:12:54,470
Scott: Yeah, you'll see a picture of him in the link.

187
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:55,878
Scott: He's a scary biker.

188
00:12:55,998 --> 00:12:57,603
Scott: Awesome Crazy guy.

189
00:12:57,683 --> 00:12:59,449
Scott: Anyway, he wrote V for Vendetta.

190
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:00,955
Scott: He also wrote Watchmen.

191
00:13:01,196 --> 00:13:02,340
Rym: Watchmen is what is I mean?

192
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,665
Rym: I'm holding it in my hands right now.

193
00:13:04,126 --> 00:13:07,258
Rym: It is perhaps one of the greatest works of American comic-dom ever.

194
00:13:07,719 --> 00:13:09,266
Rym: Yep Well Western comic-dom.

195
00:13:09,447 --> 00:13:17,097
Scott: Yeah, but yeah, this guy's amazing at the writing and He wrote League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, I think and all kinds of crazy stuff.

196
00:13:17,479 --> 00:13:25,428
Scott: now He was kind of the deep story is I'm not gonna go into all the details mostly because I don't know all of them But he did contract with DC Comics.

197
00:13:26,191 --> 00:13:30,634
Scott: He ended up being unhappy with the contract and He got out of it.

198
00:13:31,482 --> 00:13:47,669
Scott: but in the contract he pretty much gave DC the rights to his stuff and You know, he's like, oh they tricked me out of it, you know, but then another second he'd be like, yeah You know, I was I was stupid and I gave it to him but now He doesn't want them to have it.

199
00:13:47,709 --> 00:13:54,812
Scott: basically he wants them to like stop printing his books Even though they keep sending him a check, huh?

200
00:13:55,093 --> 00:13:56,980
Scott: Yeah, he's a little bit nutty in this department.

201
00:13:57,162 --> 00:14:04,920
Scott: I don't know what what he's thinking but like He's kind of mad that they're making these shitty movies out of his stuff and he doesn't want them to be able to make the movies.

202
00:14:05,881 --> 00:14:09,280
Scott: But if they're going to make the movies he wants them to take his name off of it.

203
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:14,442
Scott: They're that he thinks they're using his name to like promote like He's.

204
00:14:14,622 --> 00:14:25,964
Scott: he commented on how they printed new copies of E for Vendetta that say now a motion picture on the top And he's real unhappy about that, especially since his name is in big letters on it You know.

205
00:14:26,064 --> 00:14:29,120
Scott: and how people are using his name like in association with the movie.

206
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:34,418
Scott: When he's trying to say, you know, I think the quote was I've read this screenplay.

207
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:55,820
Scott: It's rubbish Yeah, so this guy's real sort of angry at what people are doing with the things that he's written and You know the feeling I get is That he's just being cranky after he signed a contract and then later realized what he had done and too late you signed a contract.

208
00:14:56,127 --> 00:15:00,873
Scott: tough shit You know, that's my feeling just based on interviews with him and such.

209
00:15:01,515 --> 00:15:03,020
Rym: Yeah, I don't actually know much about him.

210
00:15:03,261 --> 00:15:04,305
Rym: I just know about his works.

211
00:15:04,686 --> 00:15:06,091
Scott: Yeah, his works are excellent.

212
00:15:06,152 --> 00:15:08,340
Scott: I suggest you indulge in all of them.

213
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:15,799
Rym: Yeah, if you wonder why I was silent while Scott was on his monologue because I was holding watch in my hand I started flipping through it and then I started reading it and then I forgot that I was on the air.

214
00:15:16,621 --> 00:15:18,065
Scott: Yeah, it's it's really good.

215
00:15:18,206 --> 00:15:19,249
Rym: It's one hell of a comic.

216
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:22,300
Scott: Yeah, and so is V for Vendetta, which you should read.

217
00:15:22,701 --> 00:15:27,019
Rym: Yes, especially in light of the current socio political situation out there.

218
00:15:27,501 --> 00:15:31,191
Scott: Yeah, see I from what I can tell is number one.

219
00:15:31,913 --> 00:15:37,950
Scott: I saw I watched the second trailer for the movie and It's a trailer anyone can watch.

220
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:46,580
Scott: I don't think it's one of those spoiler trailers But there's at least one scene in this trailer that I know for sure does not happen in the comic anywhere.

221
00:15:47,365 --> 00:15:52,431
Scott: so either that's just a trailer scene or the movie is actually gonna change.

222
00:15:52,511 --> 00:16:03,670
Scott: what happened in a big way and I've also heard like whisperings around the net that like okay V for Vendetta if you don't know is about Literally anarchy versus fascism in a direct conflict.

223
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:11,400
Scott: That's what it's about that to put it very very bluntly Yeah, that's without telling you any details of characters or plot or anything.

224
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:16,860
Scott: But that's that's the general theme of it anarchy versus fascism ha extremes in conflict.

225
00:16:17,805 --> 00:16:26,118
Scott: from what I've heard the movie is like liberal versus fascism Like it's not the same thing.

226
00:16:27,283 --> 00:16:36,159
Scott: That says the whisperings I've heard and I'm not sure and I'll probably go see the movie just to be able to talk about it Or see if my cautious optimism pays off.

227
00:16:37,161 --> 00:16:38,506
Scott: Yeah, whoever's making this movie.

228
00:16:38,607 --> 00:16:47,014
Scott: You're pretty much either going to like lose me on movies forever Or maybe you know like light a tiny little fire.

229
00:16:47,576 --> 00:16:48,580
Rym: Yeah, the stakes are high.

230
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,219
Rym: Maybe Scott go to movies again.

231
00:16:50,601 --> 00:16:55,340
Scott: Maybe who knows it doesn't take much for me to go to movies used to make a movie that doesn't suck.

232
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:58,254
Rym: Honestly, most of the movies we've gone to lately were anime movies.

233
00:16:58,757 --> 00:16:59,400
Scott: Yeah, I can't.

234
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:03,220
Scott: Since Lord of the Rings when have I been to a non sucky movie?

235
00:17:03,682 --> 00:17:04,484
Scott: That wasn't anime.

236
00:17:04,747 --> 00:17:07,579
Scott: that wasn't in an art theater either like a Hollywood movie, huh?

237
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,839
Rym: Oh, you know what snakes on a plane snakes on a motherfucking plane.

238
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,003
Rym: There's not a goddamn thing you can do about it.

239
00:17:20,755 --> 00:17:34,180
Rym: So it being anime day now earlier today I was poking around looking for videos of old cosplays for various reasons and There are basically a lot of laws and problems with putting the cosplay videos from cons online.

240
00:17:34,685 --> 00:17:40,994
Scott: Like you're not allowed to portray copyrighted characters and all this stuff and it's all legal gray areas and blah.

241
00:17:41,315 --> 00:17:47,940
Rym: now Otakon has had a very strict Long-standing policy on this and they've gone after people who have put up the cosplay videos in the past.

242
00:17:48,662 --> 00:17:54,520
Rym: Well, I discovered looking through Google video that all of those cosplays are in fact available online.

243
00:17:55,261 --> 00:17:58,160
Rym: Awesome, not only those but cosplays from many other conventions.

244
00:17:58,823 --> 00:18:10,780
Rym: I linked to it in my post, but it's basically cosplay memories calm and They're basically flaunting all the warnings and cease-and-desist and whatever they've gotten and they just host a pile of cosplay videos.

245
00:18:11,522 --> 00:18:14,309
Scott: Now look, there's a big picture, Ohio con 2003.

246
00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:18,300
Rym: download the video now if you watch no other cosplay video in your life ever.

247
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:22,865
Rym: I want you to go to Otakon 2004 Mmm, and watch.

248
00:18:22,985 --> 00:18:28,674
Rym: there are two skits and it lists because it breaks everyone up into four parts and it lists what sketches are in each part.

249
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:32,893
Rym: Watch the one that involves Muppets and utenna.

250
00:18:32,913 --> 00:18:36,147
Scott: I think it's called like Something something.

251
00:18:36,267 --> 00:18:38,520
Rym: if you search for the word Muppet, you'll find it on the page.

252
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,307
Rym: Yeah, and to shadow with an axe.

253
00:18:41,668 --> 00:18:43,532
Scott: shadow with an axe is the man.

254
00:18:43,572 --> 00:18:46,680
Rym: He is quite literally shadow with an axe.

255
00:18:47,342 --> 00:18:48,606
Scott: This guy's freaking awesome.

256
00:18:48,626 --> 00:18:50,130
Scott: I remember I saw him cuz I was in.

257
00:18:50,552 --> 00:18:51,394
Scott: I've got this new.

258
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:53,360
Scott: was it starting in 2004?

259
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,431
Scott: We started this thing where we would go to the overflow room for the cosplay.

260
00:18:57,054 --> 00:18:59,623
Rym: Yeah, I mean you don't have to worry about Coming and going.

261
00:18:59,643 --> 00:19:00,367
Rym: there's no line.

262
00:19:00,628 --> 00:19:03,220
Rym: You can yell and scream and make fun of people and no one cares.

263
00:19:04,201 --> 00:19:04,843
Scott: Yep, I think.

264
00:19:04,903 --> 00:19:14,039
Scott: and also in 2004 you there's a. you can see Mike Pfeffer our friend doing his Jewish wolf would yeah doing his comedy routine, which isn't so bad.

265
00:19:14,661 --> 00:19:18,313
Scott: That was actually quite a good year for cosplay the most recent one only.

266
00:19:18,353 --> 00:19:21,484
Scott: like one or two of them were entertaining the rest of Them were kind of bleh.

267
00:19:21,925 --> 00:19:22,929
Rym: Yeah, I missed it this year.

268
00:19:22,949 --> 00:19:24,233
Rym: I forgot what I've ever last year.

269
00:19:24,253 --> 00:19:25,036
Rym: I forget what I was doing.

270
00:19:25,056 --> 00:19:26,543
Scott: I Don't know.

271
00:19:26,584 --> 00:19:27,636
Scott: We only saw part of it.

272
00:19:28,644 --> 00:19:30,634
Scott: It was kind of yeah.

273
00:19:30,855 --> 00:19:34,445
Scott: Yeah Yeah, all right.

274
00:19:34,525 --> 00:19:37,899
Scott: So I was gonna talk about this manga thing for my thing of the day.

275
00:19:38,462 --> 00:19:44,806
Rym: This is kind of weird and I just want to preface Scott's thing by saying if any of you know what the deal is with This let us know.

276
00:19:44,826 --> 00:19:53,440
Scott: Yeah, go to our forums at front row crew calm Slash forum, whatever and tell us well, actually the forums have been pretty rocking this week.

277
00:19:53,902 --> 00:20:03,472
Scott: Yeah, like more so than usual it seems like it gets real quiet But if I bother to start a thread it will explode which means there's a lot of people just sitting there checking for new stuff but not putting new stuff.

278
00:20:03,956 --> 00:20:09,515
Scott: so People if you put new stuff in the forum other people will start talking to you.

279
00:20:09,555 --> 00:20:11,000
Scott: They're there, you know.

280
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:18,760
Rym: So I have noticed like now some people are starting to post the thread for the day's episode on their own Which is good because we didn't really want to have to do that forever.

281
00:20:18,881 --> 00:20:22,559
Scott: The only reason I did that was like sort of like as a a seed.

282
00:20:23,162 --> 00:20:26,977
Scott: Yeah, what's the word for the chemicals that make reactions catalyst?

283
00:20:27,218 --> 00:20:27,700
Scott: That's it.

284
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:30,914
Scott: It's trying to catalyze the conversations going on in there.

285
00:20:30,934 --> 00:20:39,640
Rym: I didn't want it to become a thing yeah, but our eventual goal was that you guys would all talk amongst yourselves and Just have fun without us always having to be there in the way.

286
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:46,765
Scott: Yeah, but for now on my policy is gonna be if the forms are quiet for like more than I don't know like 12 hours I'll start something.

287
00:20:47,328 --> 00:20:47,750
Rym: You know what?

288
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:49,056
Rym: Let's just start horrible arguments.

289
00:20:49,377 --> 00:20:53,556
Scott: All right, cool All right, that'd be awesome to start giant flame war forum.

290
00:20:53,837 --> 00:21:00,732
Scott: Haha alright, so anyway when Osamu Tezuka first started drawing manga like Astro Boy and whatnot?

291
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:10,740
Scott: or Tetsu on Adam or whatever you want to call him He everyone knows that he got a lot of inspiration from Mickey Mouse and Mickey Mouse has four four fingers.

292
00:21:11,727 --> 00:21:28,851
Scott: so he drew Astro Boy with four fingers just like Mickey Mouse And he stuck with that until one day He went and talked to some people at Disney and he said hey Disney people Why do you draw Mickey Mouse with only four fingers?

293
00:21:29,212 --> 00:21:31,060
Rym: Well, why did they draw him with only four fingers?

294
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:42,620
Scott: well apparently if you try to animate Mickey Mouse like an animation of him as opposed to a Comic on paper and you draw him with four fingers Well, if you draw him with four fingers It looks fine.

295
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:50,835
Scott: If you draw Mickey Mouse with five fingers and animate him with old-school animation technology It looks like he has six fingers when he's moving.

296
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:57,220
Rym: now I've seen because I know the Simpsons did that for the same reason in fact even made jokes about it one day.

297
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:00,156
Rym: They talked about like the fifth magic finger on someone.

298
00:22:00,176 --> 00:22:04,860
Scott: Mm-hmm So I don't know what that's caused by but I assume it's true.

299
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:08,458
Scott: But what happened was after they told that to mr.

300
00:22:08,498 --> 00:22:08,780
Scott: Tezuka?

301
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:20,153
Scott: He stopped drawing Astro boy with only four fingers instead of drawing him with five because he's probably thought that was stupid Uh-huh, and it's probably just their shitty animation techniques, which whatever.

302
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:22,020
Rym: I have no idea, but I have no idea.

303
00:22:22,321 --> 00:22:25,720
Rym: I have no idea either but I know that other animators have had the same problem.

304
00:22:26,246 --> 00:22:26,468
Scott: I do.

305
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,420
Scott: I do have no idea.

306
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:32,199
Scott: But I also know that I've seen Astro Boy with four and five fingers in different situations.

307
00:22:32,259 --> 00:22:32,540
Rym: All right.

308
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:37,357
Scott: So anyway, anyway, there's a new problem quote-unquote problem.

309
00:22:37,738 --> 00:22:44,680
Scott: in manga Someone or a few people are drawing people with six fingers now.

310
00:22:45,922 --> 00:22:47,850
Scott: There are a few examples on this page here.

311
00:22:48,232 --> 00:22:50,200
Rym: The one from Death Note is kind of scary-looking.

312
00:22:51,001 --> 00:22:56,500
Scott: Yeah, the one from Death Note is kind of freaky, but the most of them involves someone pointing.

313
00:22:57,062 --> 00:23:07,576
Scott: So what it looks like you see it doesn't look too freaky when someone's pointing so I can understand what it's about is, you know Four fingers clenched with a thumb clenched looks like a fist.

314
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:13,613
Scott: It looks perfectly normal If you add an index finger pointing, but you still have the four clenched fingers.

315
00:23:14,194 --> 00:23:14,997
Scott: It looks kind of.

316
00:23:15,097 --> 00:23:16,260
Scott: it doesn't look kind of scary.

317
00:23:17,181 --> 00:23:18,586
Scott: Yeah, it doesn't look out of the ordinary.

318
00:23:18,626 --> 00:23:26,960
Scott: You won't catch it because four fingers clenched in a fist makes sense It looks right and one pointing finger and a bunch of clenched fingers looks right.

319
00:23:27,101 --> 00:23:32,000
Scott: So, you know, even though there's six fingers there, it doesn't Get all weird on you.

320
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:35,717
Scott: so maybe the artist messed up or maybe they did it on purpose because they thought it looked better.

321
00:23:35,737 --> 00:23:42,600
Scott: because In some ways, you know drawing only three fingers clenched can look kind of silly, you know with one sticking out.

322
00:23:43,664 --> 00:23:44,246
Scott: I can see that.

323
00:23:44,326 --> 00:23:47,840
Scott: but the one picture that's the scariest is the one from Prince of Tennis.

324
00:23:47,981 --> 00:23:52,985
Scott: This guy's throwing a ball in the air and his hand is looks kind of like a squid Cuz.

325
00:23:53,025 --> 00:23:54,734
Scott: he's got like the four fingers.

326
00:23:54,754 --> 00:23:57,887
Scott: It's you it's a. That one freaks me out.

327
00:23:57,907 --> 00:23:58,952
Scott: I don't know what they did there.

328
00:23:59,455 --> 00:24:00,520
Scott: That's the one that messes me up.

329
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:04,380
Rym: So well, I know in photography, I mean there was a long time ago at the end of high school.

330
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,073
Rym: I was at a photo shoot, you know, most people get their high school like photo whatever.

331
00:24:08,093 --> 00:24:09,077
Rym: Oh, yeah.

332
00:24:09,097 --> 00:24:11,310
Scott: Yeah high school pictures We just we had a photo studio.

333
00:24:11,351 --> 00:24:11,955
Scott: We all went to.

334
00:24:12,418 --> 00:24:22,199
Rym: yes I went to the studio and one picture they wanted is they wanted me to be like standing there with my sport jacket off But holding it like up over my shoulder in my like in my finger with my fist.

335
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:33,205
Rym: You've seen this pose and you know magazines whatever and I held it the way I always do two fingers in the coat to hold it up and then my other two fingers just in my fist Mm-hmm, and that's the way most people hold a coat.

336
00:24:33,245 --> 00:24:34,929
Rym: just because it's easy one finger is not enough.

337
00:24:34,949 --> 00:24:37,568
Rym: and The photographer said nope.

338
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,639
Rym: You gotta only have one finger in there.

339
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:43,589
Rym: otherwise, it looks weird when I take the picture even though it looks okay in the real world.

340
00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:45,767
Rym: and That stuck with me to this day.

341
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:46,552
Scott: Really?

342
00:24:46,733 --> 00:24:47,578
Scott: Yeah, huh?

343
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,163
Rym: Showed me cuz he took two pictures.

344
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:50,965
Rym: Yeah, sure enough.

345
00:24:51,005 --> 00:24:53,570
Rym: My fist just looked kind of off when both fingers were hidden.

346
00:24:54,668 --> 00:25:02,643
Scott: hmm Yeah, I gotta admit the four-fingered with the point one single finger pointing looks okay You know.

347
00:25:02,844 --> 00:25:05,555
Rym: now I gotta look at Phoenix Wright and make sure he only has five fingers.

348
00:25:05,957 --> 00:25:06,479
Scott: Oh my god.

349
00:25:07,323 --> 00:25:09,633
Scott: Oh my god, if Phoenix Wright has six fingers, I'm surprised.

350
00:25:09,834 --> 00:25:10,175
Scott: Hold on.

351
00:25:10,196 --> 00:25:11,099
Scott: I gotta go to the website.

352
00:25:12,201 --> 00:25:16,514
Rym: Well, the pause there was while we looked it up and sure enough Phoenix Wright has five fingers.

353
00:25:16,735 --> 00:25:18,240
Scott: Hooray Phoenix Wright is not a freak.

354
00:25:19,481 --> 00:25:22,492
Rym: So it being favorites week and it being Wednesday.

355
00:25:23,094 --> 00:25:28,739
Scott: We're gonna talk about our favorite anime and I guess we'll say a favorite manga in comics for some other day.

356
00:25:29,112 --> 00:25:42,020
Rym: Yeah Since we realized that talking about comics my any one of these categories would take an entire show at least so probably have favorites week Number two sometime in the future basically whenever we run out of better ideas for themes.

357
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:52,800
Scott: Yeah, so I think I've said this at the beginning of every episode this week And I'm going to continue to because we have separate feeds and some people might be only listening to this episode this week.

358
00:25:53,021 --> 00:25:54,169
Rym: Yeah, I wouldn't imagine why.

359
00:25:54,189 --> 00:26:00,959
Scott: yeah, I don't know why either but The favorites week is not the same thing as best week.

360
00:26:02,081 --> 00:26:06,274
Scott: You see when something is your favorite that means you like it more than anything else.

361
00:26:06,916 --> 00:26:13,100
Scott: when something is the best That means you consider it to be superior in quality, even though you might completely hate it.

362
00:26:14,185 --> 00:26:15,160
Rym: Now it's not the same thing.

363
00:26:15,281 --> 00:26:16,780
Rym: So for some people it is the same thing.

364
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,993
Rym: But I found that most people there's actually a very clear distinction.

365
00:26:20,013 --> 00:26:21,840
Rym: if you actually think about it now.

366
00:26:22,121 --> 00:26:23,144
Rym: I'll clear there right away.

367
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:27,919
Rym: my favorite anime are irresponsible captain Tyler and shoujo kakumei Utena.

368
00:26:28,501 --> 00:26:44,139
Scott: But the best anime in my opinion are cowboy bebop Evangelion eska flown a yep I mean if you think about movies the best movie is citizen Kane But I really couldn't watch it too many times without going but it It's the best movie.

369
00:26:44,621 --> 00:26:51,280
Scott: But my favorite movie would either be like the original Star Wars trilogy or the first matrix movie or something like that.

370
00:26:51,441 --> 00:26:52,533
Rym: Yeah, maybe Lord of the Rings.

371
00:26:52,958 --> 00:26:56,208
Rym: Yeah But anyway, all right, so anime.

372
00:26:56,248 --> 00:26:59,840
Rym: now we've both been watching anime for a long time.

373
00:27:00,903 --> 00:27:04,611
Scott: Let's see When I was in thundercats and such.

374
00:27:04,852 --> 00:27:06,379
Rym: Oh if you count that stuff my whole life.

375
00:27:06,741 --> 00:27:12,160
Scott: But if you only count real anime, we I think we both go back to the sci-fi channel in the early high school days.

376
00:27:12,441 --> 00:27:13,225
Rym: Yeah high school.

377
00:27:13,305 --> 00:27:14,390
Rym: I'm talking fourth grade.

378
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:16,540
Scott: No, I don't think it was on sci-fi channel.

379
00:27:16,741 --> 00:27:26,617
Rym: Maybe it wasn't even though the first time I'm aware of the sci-fi channel showing anime I was in fourth grade and they showed vampire hunter D. Kashan robot hunter robot carnival.

380
00:27:27,239 --> 00:27:28,021
Rym: Oh god What else.

381
00:27:28,141 --> 00:27:33,555
Rym: project a co Odin which I'd forgotten about until those anime world order guys talked about it.

382
00:27:33,655 --> 00:27:34,477
Rym: It's the worst show ever.

383
00:27:34,497 --> 00:27:38,400
Scott: Oh Yeah, I think they actually said it was the worst show ever.

384
00:27:39,803 --> 00:27:42,855
Rym: I mean I used to say great digital target was the worst show ever, but I think it is.

385
00:27:43,056 --> 00:27:44,180
Rym: I'd forgotten about Odin.

386
00:27:45,065 --> 00:27:47,199
Scott: Well, maybe we'll have to reconsider by watching them both.

387
00:27:50,276 --> 00:27:51,993
Scott: The Worst week is gonna be a different week.

388
00:27:52,013 --> 00:28:01,933
Rym: So yeah Now when I first saw anime like when I first realized that wait a minute These are cartoons, but they're good and they're not just for kids.

389
00:28:01,954 --> 00:28:02,816
Rym: Oh my god.

390
00:28:02,837 --> 00:28:05,809
Rym: I Freaked out and I loved any anime I could see.

391
00:28:05,949 --> 00:28:07,175
Rym: I watched anything.

392
00:28:07,255 --> 00:28:08,280
Rym: I rented every single tape.

393
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:15,722
Scott: They had a blockbuster I remember like I wasn't like super into anime like I had seen it and I knew what it was and I kind of wanted to See more.

394
00:28:15,782 --> 00:28:17,347
Scott: but I wasn't like whoo crazy.

395
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:20,940
Scott: and then there was like an anime week on the sci-fi channel at some point.

396
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:21,642
Scott: We're like every night.

397
00:28:21,663 --> 00:28:26,420
Scott: They showed some anime and like the first day was like fatal fury.

398
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,770
Scott: It was like king of fighters or something like that.

399
00:28:29,212 --> 00:28:33,820
Scott: You know, the the neo-geo fighting game And I was even watching that and like all excited.

400
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:38,420
Scott: But yeah, I mean I read much to make me go.

401
00:28:39,582 --> 00:28:41,006
Rym: Yeah, I mean any anime in the world.

402
00:28:41,047 --> 00:28:44,377
Rym: I loved it and it really honestly for all the years.

403
00:28:44,498 --> 00:28:45,120
Rym: I watched anime.

404
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,620
Rym: It wasn't until I got to college that I saw what I would consider good anime.

405
00:28:49,481 --> 00:28:50,788
Scott: Yeah towards the end of high school.

406
00:28:50,909 --> 00:28:59,017
Scott: I actually wanted to watch a lot of anime And then when I saw there was a little anime club, I was like, oh, yeah There's where I'm gonna get it cuz right now I can't really get it so much.

407
00:28:59,359 --> 00:28:59,460
Rym: now.

408
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:08,767
Rym: I remember very clearly that the first anime club meeting of the RIT anime club now all of us the whole crew was there But none of us knew each other yet.

409
00:29:09,249 --> 00:29:09,931
Scott: We're sitting.

410
00:29:09,951 --> 00:29:14,215
Rym: I was sitting like with some weird stranger people that yeah I was sitting with a friend of mine from high school.

411
00:29:14,638 --> 00:29:14,779
Rym: Mm-hmm.

412
00:29:15,401 --> 00:29:20,137
Rym: And all I know is that they showed cowboy bebop episode 5 and showed that.

413
00:29:20,377 --> 00:29:21,160
Scott: yeah, they showed gunsmith.

414
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,047
Rym: Yeah, gunsmith cats, which is awesome.

415
00:29:23,127 --> 00:29:25,375
Scott: They showed music videos, which I'd never seen before.

416
00:29:25,536 --> 00:29:26,600
Rym: Yeah anime music videos.

417
00:29:26,741 --> 00:29:28,780
Rym: I had found one once when I was in high school.

418
00:29:28,941 --> 00:29:30,309
Scott: I don't even know what the hell they said.

419
00:29:30,329 --> 00:29:31,275
Scott: they were showing music videos.

420
00:29:31,295 --> 00:29:32,000
Scott: I was like, what the hell?

421
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,183
Rym: Yeah, well, here's the thing.

422
00:29:33,244 --> 00:29:36,156
Rym: I found an AMV and I didn't know what it was, but it's.

423
00:29:36,236 --> 00:29:37,220
Rym: I still have it to this day.

424
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:42,240
Rym: It's just a crappy little AVI to Sailor Moon and Phil Collins some Phil Collins song.

425
00:29:43,003 --> 00:29:46,819
Rym: And I remember thinking it was this unique awesome thing and the person who did it must have been so cool.

426
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:57,856
Rym: and Then I saw AMV is there's a million of them and oh it's real hard to be cool now on the internet where everything is mixed with everything But a cowboy bebop.

427
00:29:57,897 --> 00:29:59,803
Rym: and To this day.

428
00:29:59,863 --> 00:30:04,580
Rym: I still really haven't found a show that as a whole in my opinion is better than cowboy bebop.

429
00:30:05,142 --> 00:30:05,985
Scott: I mean, I gotta agree.

430
00:30:06,025 --> 00:30:07,932
Scott: The best anime is kind of bebop.

431
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:09,980
Rym: But I mean there are shows that are real close.

432
00:30:10,161 --> 00:30:12,120
Rym: Evangelion I think is a masterpiece.

433
00:30:12,762 --> 00:30:18,620
Scott: No, I think Evangelion, you know, it's great, but it's not the best because it just you know, it's not accessible.

434
00:30:18,922 --> 00:30:21,340
Rym: Yeah, well, I guess it's the best you need to have everything.

435
00:30:21,882 --> 00:30:23,709
Rym: I guess I can agree in any area.

436
00:30:23,829 --> 00:30:26,399
Scott: if you if you're min-maxing you can't possibly be the best.

437
00:30:27,021 --> 00:30:31,610
Rym: All right, then how about eska flown a which I think is very much up there even slightly higher than Ava?

438
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,944
Scott: No, not really.

439
00:30:34,345 --> 00:30:39,380
Scott: It doesn't really because it's just a. it's just a really really good, you know fantasy anime.

440
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,699
Scott: It doesn't have any amazingness that would make it, you know the best.

441
00:30:43,681 --> 00:30:48,500
Rym: Yeah, see part of it might be that I saw eska flown a a long time ago, but I've seen it again recently.

442
00:30:48,661 --> 00:30:53,280
Rym: I still love it, but cowboy bebop is looking for another watching sometime soon.

443
00:30:53,681 --> 00:30:58,160
Scott: Yeah, you can watch it like it's one of the it happens to be the best but you can also watch it a thousand times.

444
00:30:59,002 --> 00:31:00,735
Rym: I remember one time our friend Pete was over.

445
00:31:00,755 --> 00:31:08,800
Rym: I think it was Pete me I forget who it was and We were gonna watch like the first five episodes of cowboy bebop because he'd never seen it and we ended up watching the whole show.

446
00:31:09,302 --> 00:31:10,266
Rym: Alex might have been Ali.

447
00:31:10,286 --> 00:31:10,848
Rym: I don't remember.

448
00:31:10,868 --> 00:31:11,853
Rym: that was a long time ago.

449
00:31:11,873 --> 00:31:13,058
Scott: Yeah, we ended up just watching the whole.

450
00:31:13,078 --> 00:31:13,580
Scott: we couldn't stop.

451
00:31:13,942 --> 00:31:16,035
Rym: Yeah, we just watched the whole show over the course of a weekend.

452
00:31:16,056 --> 00:31:17,784
Scott: Mm-hmm Yeah, it's a show.

453
00:31:17,825 --> 00:31:19,211
Scott: you really once you see one episode.

454
00:31:19,231 --> 00:31:21,400
Scott: if you have the rest of them there is just dangerous weapon.

455
00:31:21,957 --> 00:31:37,309
Rym: well I guess one test that seems to really show in terms of cowboy bebop is that I gave cowboy bebop to my dad and he Loved it and I've lent it to people who hate anime never heard of anime don't care about it, whatever and Without exception they've all loved it.

456
00:31:37,952 --> 00:31:39,399
Rym: Yeah, they've all wanted to see more.

457
00:31:40,345 --> 00:31:43,062
Scott: That's what's so terrific about it All right.

458
00:31:43,122 --> 00:31:46,372
Scott: Anyway, my favorite anime not the best anime.

459
00:31:46,632 --> 00:31:47,013
Scott: Actually.

460
00:31:47,154 --> 00:31:52,715
Scott: I'm not even gonna argue that they're the best anime are probably the original macross

461
00:31:53,198 --> 00:31:53,379
Rym: and

462
00:31:55,002 --> 00:31:57,478
Scott: Maybe I don't want to say initial D, but I think I might

463
00:31:58,982 --> 00:32:05,479
Rym: See to me initial D at least the first season and the movie because the rest of the show I'm really losing interest real fast.

464
00:32:06,461 --> 00:32:11,120
Rym: But I love it, but I listed as one of those shows that I know it's dumb, but I love it.

465
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,591
Rym: Anyway, yeah initial D.

466
00:32:12,632 --> 00:32:13,660
Scott: I'm not gonna say it's good.

467
00:32:13,881 --> 00:32:18,720
Scott: I mean if you're gonna argue about the best anime, it wouldn't even get on to any of anyone's list.

468
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,983
Rym: It's definitely on the B list.

469
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:25,900
Scott: Yeah, maybe even the C list, but I just can't watch it without feeling really really good.

470
00:32:26,281 --> 00:32:31,580
Rym: I think that's a side effect of one the eurobeat music which we had never experienced before until we saw this show.

471
00:32:32,022 --> 00:32:37,953
Scott: But I mean I've why I've watched all of initial D Maybe five times at least the first season at least five times.

472
00:32:37,993 --> 00:32:41,423
Scott: He's not exaggerating and he was not Every time.

473
00:32:41,443 --> 00:32:42,327
Scott: and it's to.

474
00:32:42,407 --> 00:32:45,980
Scott: even if I watch an episode I've seen before it's still exciting.

475
00:32:46,443 --> 00:32:48,880
Scott: I get I still getting the manga and it's still exciting.

476
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:53,254
Rym: You should see how many inside jokes we have that are based solely on initial D.

477
00:32:53,636 --> 00:32:54,759
Scott: It's just so much fun.

478
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:56,520
Rym: I mean, here's an example.

479
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:01,240
Rym: There's a scene later on in the show where he's talking me the main characters racing some guy, right?

480
00:33:01,662 --> 00:33:04,917
Rym: Which yeah, you never expect that in initial D a show about racing.

481
00:33:05,098 --> 00:33:13,419
Rym: Yeah, and suddenly talking me passes this guy and the guy turns and sees talking me there and he has this look on his face.

482
00:33:13,439 --> 00:33:15,203
Rym: and Now we make this.

483
00:33:15,283 --> 00:33:20,180
Rym: we make the look to each other whenever we see someone failing or whenever we're about to fail at something.

484
00:33:20,642 --> 00:33:22,792
Scott: Yep, it's like up you make the face.

485
00:33:22,812 --> 00:33:29,634
Rym: I Guess part of the reason we really like it is that initial D. when we first saw it We thought it was the stupidest thing ever.

486
00:33:29,816 --> 00:33:33,086
Scott: Oh my god I went to a club Watch four episodes of it.

487
00:33:33,167 --> 00:33:34,532
Scott: the first four and at the first.

488
00:33:34,572 --> 00:33:39,280
Scott: the fourth episode is a cliffhanger because you don't know who's gonna win The race and I remember we all walked out like that was the dumbest thing.

489
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:45,319
Scott: I walked out and I actually thought that was really dumb, you know, and I also thought I wonder who wins.

490
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:53,520
Scott: But at the same because I haven't seen any initial D I don't know who that the same guy wins every time and we kept kind of talking about it like yeah that show sucks.

491
00:33:53,681 --> 00:33:57,520
Scott: But I didn't you know, I definitely had a bad opinion of it after watching four episodes.

492
00:33:57,942 --> 00:34:01,017
Scott: It's like I must have not heard the Eurobeat music or something.

493
00:34:01,238 --> 00:34:05,899
Scott: I don't know yeah, so then we then we went and there was a marathon of the whole first season.

494
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:10,875
Rym: and We went because we figured we'll go and we'll leave after we found out if he wins.

495
00:34:10,996 --> 00:34:13,304
Rym: just because we wanted closure We ended up staying to the end.

496
00:34:13,706 --> 00:34:13,928
Scott: Yep.

497
00:34:14,007 --> 00:34:23,940
Scott: I mean when I went in for that marathon of the whole first season It's like there was a lot quieter in the room so I can concentrate and I can really absorb all the stuff that was going.

498
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:25,485
Scott: You had to get into it.

499
00:34:25,626 --> 00:34:31,005
Scott: if you just kind of casually watch initial D you'll think it's this boring What the hell's going on stupidity.

500
00:34:31,146 --> 00:34:35,300
Rym: or if you expect any sort of deep meaning from this show, you're gonna be disappointed.

501
00:34:35,442 --> 00:34:36,620
Scott: Yeah, you're gonna be real disappointed.

502
00:34:37,481 --> 00:34:44,951
Scott: But if you sit there and watch initial D and you get into it and you feel the energy It's so much fun.

503
00:34:44,971 --> 00:34:45,678
Scott: Oh my god.

504
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:50,119
Rym: Yeah, the best way to do it like a thousand times I guess my advice is never watch initial D alone.

505
00:34:50,641 --> 00:34:52,929
Rym: The more people you have in the room the better.

506
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:56,685
Rym: even people that hate the show because everyone will be yelling by the end of An episode.

507
00:34:56,705 --> 00:34:57,129
Rym: Mm-hmm.

508
00:34:57,674 --> 00:34:58,299
Scott: That's what it's about.

509
00:34:59,026 --> 00:35:08,969
Rym: Now for me, like I already said irresponsible captain Tyler which is one of the first anime I watched all the way through and For reasons, I really can't really describe.

510
00:35:09,029 --> 00:35:10,133
Rym: I just love that show.

511
00:35:10,153 --> 00:35:11,478
Rym: It's funny.

512
00:35:11,518 --> 00:35:11,960
Rym: It's cute.

513
00:35:12,563 --> 00:35:13,971
Rym: The end made me cry a little bit.

514
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:15,419
Rym: the movie made me cry even more.

515
00:35:16,162 --> 00:35:22,267
Rym: Yeah, you don't cry at the end of initial D and I guess part of the reason I really like Tyler is that for anyone Who knows me?

516
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:27,720
Rym: Uh If a person like Tyler existed, they would be my role model hero and God.

517
00:35:28,801 --> 00:35:30,164
Scott: Yeah, that makes sense.

518
00:35:30,546 --> 00:35:33,735
Rym: I mean, I don't really plan at all into the future.

519
00:35:34,236 --> 00:35:35,660
Rym: I'm generally very happy-go-lucky.

520
00:35:35,741 --> 00:35:40,136
Rym: I tend to just leave everything to chance and Tyler is I guess the epitome of that.

521
00:35:41,341 --> 00:35:42,484
Rym: Plus in the show.

522
00:35:43,186 --> 00:35:44,710
Rym: he this is kind of us in a side.

523
00:35:45,111 --> 00:35:47,940
Rym: He ends up with this alien princess girl who?

524
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,424
Rym: Ironically enough.

525
00:35:49,666 --> 00:35:50,633
Rym: I guess not ironically.

526
00:35:50,693 --> 00:35:55,693
Rym: just coincidentally I Dated in college a girl who looked almost exactly like her.

527
00:35:56,034 --> 00:35:57,440
Scott: you dated an alien princess.

528
00:35:58,183 --> 00:36:02,963
Rym: Well, I'll note that the alien princess actually just looked like a normal redheaded girl Mm-hmm.

529
00:36:03,124 --> 00:36:06,395
Scott: So Rym has a personal connection with the show and thus making it his favorite.

530
00:36:06,555 --> 00:36:13,492
Rym: I Have no personal connection at all with initial D Other than the fact that you tend to drive fast and or recklessly at times.

531
00:36:13,874 --> 00:36:20,219
Scott: No, not really But they don't really drive recklessly and initially there's many wrecks.

532
00:36:20,962 --> 00:36:22,607
Scott: Yeah, they're not less right now, of course.

533
00:36:22,708 --> 00:36:26,059
Rym: I could also give an equally important nod to shoujo kakumei.

534
00:36:26,139 --> 00:36:32,287
Rym: utenna Yeah, which we a bunch of us watch together for a while Mm-hmm.

535
00:36:32,692 --> 00:36:36,780
Scott: I mean Utenna is a good show, but it's kind of crazy.

536
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:44,439
Scott: Yeah, well, it's got some aspects of it I like a whole lot and other aspects are just kind of like and I'd rather have just that part of the show.

537
00:36:44,741 --> 00:36:47,399
Rym: Watching utenna is like reading Hawthorne.

538
00:36:47,961 --> 00:36:56,003
Rym: Every single sentence is just a metaphor metaphor metaphor metaphor metaphor to the point that you're barely aware of the fact that there's a show Happening around it.

539
00:36:56,605 --> 00:37:13,789
Scott: Yeah, I think that part of the problem with utenna is that a lot of the times imagine if You just someone's blatantly doing things that are supposed to be symbolic like they're just throwing symbols at you but a lot of them just represent nothing or they're just Symbols for the sake of making symbols

540
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:16,159
Rym: see very few of them actually mean nothing in the show.

541
00:37:16,714 --> 00:37:25,480
Scott: Yeah I think because no matter what symbol if I made a show that was just a bunch of symbols Someone out there could come up with a meaning for every single one of them no matter what the plot was.

542
00:37:25,901 --> 00:37:28,592
Rym: I think most of this part that you're referring to is from the.

543
00:37:29,033 --> 00:37:39,780
Rym: there's a part in the black rose saga Which is in the middle of the show Where it the show seems to make fun of itself and they start throw it like absolutely ridiculous metaphors all over the place.

544
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,373
Scott: Well, that's one particular the point that there's.

545
00:37:41,474 --> 00:37:50,274
Rym: even at one point There's like it shows something and then there's a hand that appears on the screen Pointing at it to draw your attention to it to remind you that it's symbolic of something.

546
00:37:50,655 --> 00:37:51,960
Rym: Mm-hmm, which was just silly.

547
00:37:52,622 --> 00:37:53,204
Scott: Yeah, that's just.

548
00:37:53,264 --> 00:37:54,930
Scott: that's one part in like one episode.

549
00:37:54,971 --> 00:37:57,540
Scott: but in general the show does all kinds of stuff.

550
00:37:57,741 --> 00:38:01,132
Scott: You know whether some of it means something some of it doesn't.

551
00:38:01,213 --> 00:38:08,034
Scott: some of it you can make mean something like Nikki in the stopwatch thing and oh, no, that's specifically not supposed to mean anything.

552
00:38:08,175 --> 00:38:19,059
Scott: Yeah, you see what I'm talking about Mickey's just an anal kind of little person Yeah, and like people always lie when they're meeting in places and they'll have the shows over dramatic.

553
00:38:19,099 --> 00:38:20,993
Rym: All right All right, here's how I like it.

554
00:38:21,053 --> 00:38:27,420
Scott: on very prurient level It's most of the symbols are just weird accessories in scenes that they draw attention to frequently.

555
00:38:28,323 --> 00:38:30,020
Rym: See, I think that there's a lot more.

556
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:33,138
Rym: I think that there was a lot of thought put into what was shown where and when.

557
00:38:33,158 --> 00:38:35,450
Scott: oh Yeah, there might have been thought to it.

558
00:38:35,692 --> 00:38:37,963
Scott: It was crazy thought But it was.

559
00:38:38,043 --> 00:38:40,373
Scott: you know, it doesn't matter whether the thought was there or not.

560
00:38:40,414 --> 00:38:40,735
Scott: the point.

561
00:38:40,795 --> 00:38:47,595
Rym: on a very basic level I like the show because it's got the tall thin pretty angular people and rose petals flying everywhere.

562
00:38:47,936 --> 00:38:49,640
Rym: Everything's overdramatic and crazy.

563
00:38:50,281 --> 00:38:55,076
Rym: Everyone is just really really Anime, I guess is a one way to put it.

564
00:38:56,062 --> 00:39:06,274
Rym: Yeah, and honestly what I really like about the show is just that Once you see the end and you figure out what's going on because the show is kind of weird You go watch the show all over again.

565
00:39:06,314 --> 00:39:06,940
Scott: It's totally different.

566
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:13,689
Rym: Yeah, watching the show the second time through this is one of those shows where once you realize what's going on Every every single thing in the show is different.

567
00:39:13,709 --> 00:39:19,389
Rym: now because you watch it again and you realize wait a minute But in the very first episode that happens because of this.

568
00:39:19,711 --> 00:39:20,413
Rym: Oh shit.

569
00:39:20,613 --> 00:39:21,195
Rym: I get it.

570
00:39:21,436 --> 00:39:21,918
Rym: Oh, man.

571
00:39:21,938 --> 00:39:22,620
Rym: This is crazy.

572
00:39:22,881 --> 00:39:33,883
Scott: Yeah, it's like when we first I didn't figure it out until like two minutes before the end Yeah, and I didn't open like I had it in my brain and I should have said something because then people would have been like Oh Scott got it.

573
00:39:33,924 --> 00:39:35,088
Scott: But no, I didn't say anything.

574
00:39:35,128 --> 00:39:36,473
Rym: Yeah, cuz not a shit talker.

575
00:39:36,533 --> 00:39:39,711
Scott: I Could be lying, but I'm not.

576
00:39:40,135 --> 00:39:40,640
Rym: Yeah, I figured.

577
00:39:41,641 --> 00:39:42,606
Rym: Yeah, I mean it's.

578
00:39:42,687 --> 00:39:45,280
Rym: it's one of the few shows where we were all watching it together.

579
00:39:45,862 --> 00:39:49,960
Rym: And there's a point in the show at the end where quite literally we all screamed.

580
00:39:50,942 --> 00:39:53,256
Rym: It takes a lot to make me scream during a show.

581
00:39:53,276 --> 00:39:55,166
Rym: Mm-hmm I mean I've cried.

582
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:57,600
Rym: I'll admit that I cry like a girl and a lot of anime.

583
00:39:57,881 --> 00:39:59,771
Scott: I used to cry at a lot of stuff but not anymore.

584
00:39:59,811 --> 00:40:01,600
Rym: Really I cry like a little girl.

585
00:40:02,223 --> 00:40:05,040
Rym: I just start bawling sometimes I try to hold it in just doesn't work.

586
00:40:05,502 --> 00:40:07,592
Rym: I just I cry but I don't scream.

587
00:40:07,753 --> 00:40:08,919
Rym: and utenna made me scream.

588
00:40:10,081 --> 00:40:14,737
Rym: Yep, well, we could list all the shows we've cried at the end of no because I can't really remember.

589
00:40:14,757 --> 00:40:15,038
Scott: try gun.

590
00:40:16,162 --> 00:40:17,589
Scott: Yeah, kinda yeah you cried.

591
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:21,503
Scott: we all cry more in like 23 than 26.

592
00:40:21,503 --> 00:40:23,012
Rym: yeah, 26.

593
00:40:23,012 --> 00:40:23,515
Rym: See try gun.

594
00:40:23,535 --> 00:40:24,360
Rym: I think is a really good shot.

595
00:40:24,441 --> 00:40:33,386
Scott: Definitely wouldn't call it the best or my favorite but it's very high on my list if try gonna continued more in the vein of the first few episodes instead of it kind of Changed a little towards the end.

596
00:40:33,426 --> 00:40:36,400
Scott: It would have been a much better more favorite show.

597
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:42,120
Rym: See, I don't know because the first few episodes were just silly and then later it had, you know plot meaning character development.

598
00:40:42,582 --> 00:40:43,626
Scott: Yeah, you should read the manga.

599
00:40:44,148 --> 00:40:45,452
Rym: the manga makes no sense.

600
00:40:45,854 --> 00:40:47,480
Rym: the manga is just crazy batshit.

601
00:40:47,881 --> 00:40:49,125
Rym: I can't follow the manga.

602
00:40:49,406 --> 00:40:53,479
Rym: if I had not already seen the show the manga would be entirely indecipherable to me.

603
00:40:54,242 --> 00:40:55,850
Scott: Yeah, the manga doesn't really create.

604
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,698
Scott: the guy draws really action scenes.

605
00:40:57,759 --> 00:41:04,380
Scott: Well He's like a hammer trying to whack all the nails and also the screws and the bolts and the nuts.

606
00:41:04,782 --> 00:41:05,646
Rym: I just can't follow it.

607
00:41:05,706 --> 00:41:08,560
Rym: I'd like to because I want to know more about these characters in this world.

608
00:41:08,761 --> 00:41:11,340
Scott: Oh, I kind of know but maybe I'll explain it someday.

609
00:41:11,681 --> 00:41:16,200
Rym: I just can't read that manga and this is coming from a guy who's read Sailor Moon.

610
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:21,279
Scott: Yeah, so you my other favorite anime I said already was Matt the original Macross.

611
00:41:21,339 --> 00:41:26,780
Scott: now I saw Robo tech not when it was shown in the 70s, but when it was shown on Cartoon Network.

612
00:41:27,541 --> 00:41:31,039
Rym: Yeah, I watched much of it then and I didn't know much of what was going on.

613
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:39,485
Scott: Yeah See this is the thing is that was the first show where I was watching Toonami like religiously when Moltar was the guy I miss him.

614
00:41:39,746 --> 00:41:41,552
Scott: Yeah, when they would show Space Ghost and Thunder.

615
00:41:41,592 --> 00:41:43,900
Scott: That's why I started watching because it's Space Ghost and Thundercats.

616
00:41:44,903 --> 00:41:49,854
Scott: One day they show the show Robo tech and I was like, alright I'll watch the first episode of this show and it was alright.

617
00:41:50,497 --> 00:41:53,738
Scott: and the next day There was another episode and it continued from episode one.

618
00:41:54,702 --> 00:42:01,400
Scott: So I promised myself I wasn't gonna miss any episodes and I managed to make it well into the second story of Robo tech.

619
00:42:01,728 --> 00:42:03,505
Scott: You know Which was actually?

620
00:42:03,846 --> 00:42:09,606
Scott: I think it's Southern Cross is the name of the real and because it Robo tech if you don't know It's like three or four animes combined.

621
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:12,495
Scott: They basically put these animes end-to-end.

622
00:42:12,575 --> 00:42:22,599
Scott: So the first anime is Macross Southern Cross and Genesis Rider Mospita and they put these shows end-to-end Right as if they were one big show.

623
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:29,100
Scott: But really it's three animes stuck together and redubbed and they said that they made a proto culture.

624
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:35,510
Scott: yeah, they took proto culture and they pretended that certain characters are related to other characters to make them stick together.

625
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:41,930
Scott: and Basically if you just watch these three anime separately on their own they're all much better than Robo tech.

626
00:42:42,191 --> 00:42:49,904
Scott: Yes, but when I watched Robo tech for the first time I realized that the show had changed and I learned that they were actually separate shows.

627
00:42:50,345 --> 00:42:55,578
Scott: and the first show is Macross and like Back this is so long ago.

628
00:42:55,598 --> 00:42:59,401
Scott: I was still crying at the end of anime, but I didn't really cry but it was just like at the end.

629
00:42:59,461 --> 00:43:04,989
Scott: I was like Yeah, yeah Macross is a good show cuz I watched the whole thing through.

630
00:43:05,009 --> 00:43:08,390
Rym: well He bought that crazy box set that came out way back in the day.

631
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:13,330
Scott: Yeah, so then I watched started watching the second show and I watched the second show through to the end.

632
00:43:13,892 --> 00:43:18,150
Scott: But it didn't really quite give the odd because I think it was destroyed too much by its Robo tech a vacation.

633
00:43:18,472 --> 00:43:19,944
Scott: So Southern Cross, I'm sorry.

634
00:43:20,024 --> 00:43:20,649
Scott: You're not so good.

635
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:26,950
Scott: I never actually saw the third one because Cartoon Network didn't air it and I don't know where to find it.

636
00:43:27,131 --> 00:43:29,070
Scott: I'm sure I could get it on DVD now, but whatever.

637
00:43:30,031 --> 00:43:42,910
Scott: But then when I got the the box set which is I think sophomore year college Yeah, we were gonna make that took all of the original of Macross the original on Robo tech a fine version.

638
00:43:43,353 --> 00:43:49,723
Scott: They read they up to the graphics so they were visible and they added subtitles instead of dubbing.

639
00:43:49,743 --> 00:43:52,170
Scott: and you watch that and it's like.

640
00:43:53,514 --> 00:43:55,309
Scott: And then I could really see what the hell was going on.

641
00:43:56,432 --> 00:43:57,234
Scott: And it's hella good.

642
00:43:57,957 --> 00:43:58,097
Scott: it's.

643
00:43:58,539 --> 00:43:58,700
Scott: it's.

644
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,165
Scott: let's see what's so great about it.

645
00:44:00,265 --> 00:44:03,957
Scott: number one, it's got awesome robots But it's robots that make sense.

646
00:44:03,997 --> 00:44:07,548
Scott: It's not like crazy condoms with super attacks or anything.

647
00:44:07,608 --> 00:44:16,710
Scott: It's like Imagine if we had military technology, you know a hundred years from now It's definitely gassaraki robots as opposed to big O robots.

648
00:44:16,754 --> 00:44:23,470
Scott: Yeah Imagine if like we had some alien technology that we learned stuff from and we advanced far into the future from now.

649
00:44:24,213 --> 00:44:25,099
Scott: It's like fighter jets.

650
00:44:25,139 --> 00:44:27,050
Scott: Well, our fighter jets would transform into robots.

651
00:44:27,211 --> 00:44:27,694
Scott: It makes sense.

652
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,009
Scott: and the fighter jets in the show?

653
00:44:30,451 --> 00:44:35,510
Scott: The story is that one of the guys working on the show actually said what if we had a plane that turned into a robot?

654
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:36,312
Scott: That would be awesome.

655
00:44:36,653 --> 00:44:38,078
Scott: And everyone was like what you're crazy.

656
00:44:38,479 --> 00:44:42,090
Scott: So then he made the toy first and the toys so high quality.

657
00:44:42,852 --> 00:44:46,590
Scott: So then they just made the show look exactly like the toy and it makes perfect sense.

658
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:49,017
Rym: Didn't the toy come first in big O as well.

659
00:44:49,037 --> 00:45:02,010
Rym: I I remember reading something like the guy made the toy to try to pimp his show idea.

660
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:09,949
Rym: You know the big O robot and all I remember the very funny part was that the people he showed the toy to asked him Why the hell does he have interchangeable fists?

661
00:45:12,753 --> 00:45:18,625
Scott: Yeah, that's good one No, but then macross also has the great music.

662
00:45:18,745 --> 00:45:23,146
Scott: even the dubbed Robotech has awesome music and the thing about it.

663
00:45:23,206 --> 00:45:26,898
Scott: It's not like The music isn't like music in other shows.

664
00:45:27,038 --> 00:45:40,280
Scott: It's classy sort of show tune pop tune type of things that min may sings and they're all really like no matter what Set decade you're in no matter what the music style of the times is.

665
00:45:40,842 --> 00:45:45,355
Scott: if you watch this show the song is kind of grow Like they play the same.

666
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:58,609
Scott: you'll hear her sing the same song and like every single episode and she has about maybe ten songs at most probably less than that, but they all grow on you and you recognize them and it's like And you begin to associate them in your mind with different things going on.

667
00:45:59,731 --> 00:46:03,186
Scott: It's just really good and the space battles don't have too much stock footage.

668
00:46:03,588 --> 00:46:03,990
Rym: No, no.

669
00:46:05,751 --> 00:46:16,127
Rym: Now another show that's near and dear to me though people often make fun of me and I have good reasons for this show Being as good to me as it is or as I'm going to claim it is Sailor Moon.

670
00:46:16,853 --> 00:46:22,936
Scott: So in one sec, I've seen all 200 episodes and all the movies and I'm gonna be proud of.

671
00:46:23,056 --> 00:46:24,622
Rym: well, the thing is way back.

672
00:46:24,663 --> 00:46:30,282
Rym: there wasn't so much anime I can get my hands on and I found this fan subber and I ended up.

673
00:46:30,302 --> 00:46:32,110
Rym: these are like this is back before they were digi subs.

674
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:33,335
Rym: Like you couldn't get fan subs.

675
00:46:34,058 --> 00:46:37,050
Rym: So I got all these VHS fan subs of Sailor Moon.

676
00:46:37,491 --> 00:46:40,379
Rym: It was like the first non American released anime I'd ever seen.

677
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:49,615
Rym: so being the anime fan that I was I sat down and watched it And I gotta say of all the magical girl shows out there.

678
00:46:49,636 --> 00:46:59,099
Rym: I think Sailor Moon is still probably the definitive one and If you cut out about a hundred and seventy five of those episodes I really think there's a good plot there.

679
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:10,879
Scott: if you cut out a hundred and seventy five episodes Maybe I mean if you want to just compare based on quality and enjoyment I don't think you can really say that Sailor Moon is better than fancy Lala.

680
00:47:10,899 --> 00:47:19,610
Rym: I Sailor Moon has a hurricane michiro, which I think who I think are awesome.

681
00:47:20,435 --> 00:47:37,849
Rym: I don't know what the hell that is actually, it has the Sailor Moon s because it's broken up into different story, you know, yeah and Sailor Moon s. if any of you have never seen any of Sailor Moon and you want to see kind of not really the origin But like the defining magical girl show watch Sailor Moon s from start to finish.

682
00:47:38,991 --> 00:47:39,895
Rym: That is in my eyes.

683
00:47:39,956 --> 00:47:41,362
Rym: What is magical girl show should be?

684
00:47:41,583 --> 00:47:42,970
Scott: is that the one they kept out of American?

685
00:47:43,753 --> 00:47:44,274
Rym: Yeah, that was that.

686
00:47:44,355 --> 00:47:58,933
Rym: that was right at the point because they were showing Sailor Moon in America to little kids and they were dubbing it and changing it and then they got to Sailor Moon s and that's when they realized that this show probably isn't for American kids because Lesbians death.

687
00:47:59,294 --> 00:48:00,418
Rym: Oh my god plot.

688
00:48:00,759 --> 00:48:04,049
Scott: So the lesbian porn part with is what you think a magical girl show should be.

689
00:48:05,153 --> 00:48:07,169
Scott: See, there's actually the last time you watch this.

690
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:11,650
Rym: Actually, the last time I watched it was when I was a senior in high school.

691
00:48:12,391 --> 00:48:17,710
Scott: So are you sure your memory isn't slightly blurred based on your senior in high school wanting to look at Lesbians?

692
00:48:17,751 --> 00:48:25,072
Rym: Oh, no, I'm not saying the show is great I'm just saying that in terms of shows that have affected me or shows that I like there's a place in my heart for Sailor Moon.

693
00:48:25,233 --> 00:48:29,577
Scott: All right, because I think the show is favorites Which means has to be the top of the list.

694
00:48:29,597 --> 00:48:33,573
Scott: because if we're just gonna go based on shows that I like and shows That affected me.

695
00:48:33,593 --> 00:48:34,478
Scott: Well, let's let's see.

696
00:48:34,518 --> 00:48:36,649
Scott: Let's get a little pen and paper out here.

697
00:48:37,133 --> 00:48:44,146
Rym: Well, see if we're talking about favorites, I mean Even if I list every show I've liked that's less than maybe 5% of all the anime out there.

698
00:48:44,427 --> 00:48:45,250
Scott: Yeah, that's true.

699
00:48:45,971 --> 00:48:49,243
Scott: But if you're gonna talk about just liked at all, we got like Gundam.

700
00:48:49,304 --> 00:48:51,654
Rym: see I like Sailor Moon a lot I mean.

701
00:48:51,694 --> 00:48:54,449
Rym: granted a lot of that is clouded by the fact that I saw it a long time ago.

702
00:48:54,992 --> 00:48:57,926
Scott: Yeah, I'm trying to you know, but since it's favorites, I'm trying to stick with stuff.

703
00:48:57,946 --> 00:49:01,364
Scott: That's like, all right Yeah, really say I like that more than I like that.

704
00:49:01,384 --> 00:49:05,502
Rym: Well, like you mentioned Gundam seed I wouldn't even bring it up because I liked it, but I didn't like it that much.

705
00:49:05,863 --> 00:49:10,770
Scott: Yeah, I don't know I could really think of stuff that I liked as much as initial D and Macross.

706
00:49:11,091 --> 00:49:17,496
Scott: I could think of stuff that is as good as and stuff that I liked a lot but not as much I remember in high school.

707
00:49:17,556 --> 00:49:19,966
Rym: I really liked Tenchi Muyo and to this day.

708
00:49:20,026 --> 00:49:23,830
Rym: I still love it though I hate every spin-off and every TV series after the original.

709
00:49:24,164 --> 00:49:32,289
Rym: Well We've been talking mostly about series for a lot of reasons because we tried to think of anime movies that really affected us or we really loved or our favorite movies.

710
00:49:32,389 --> 00:49:34,883
Rym: and It's a lot harder to pick a favorite movie.

711
00:49:34,923 --> 00:49:35,909
Rym: I think than a favorite show.

712
00:49:36,613 --> 00:49:37,014
Scott: I think it's just.

713
00:49:37,035 --> 00:49:42,175
Scott: there's not a lot of quantity of anime movies and a lot of them are like Summary movies and recap movies.

714
00:49:42,215 --> 00:49:47,530
Rym: So you really can't grow movies that are just long episodes like the cowboy bebop movie or all the Sailor Moon movies.

715
00:49:47,891 --> 00:49:52,430
Scott: Yeah, well, I think Ghibli is like, you know overall is the anime movie King?

716
00:49:52,671 --> 00:49:53,795
Rym: Yeah, I don't think we even need that.

717
00:49:53,835 --> 00:49:57,690
Rym: Well, we'll consider non Ghibli movies because honestly Ghibli movies are just amazing.

718
00:49:57,871 --> 00:50:02,192
Scott: Yeah, but if I had to pick one Ghibli movie, I would just pick spirited away Overall.

719
00:50:02,233 --> 00:50:02,956
Scott: the rest I think.

720
00:50:03,217 --> 00:50:06,270
Rym: for me, I don't know I actually really really liked house moving castle.

721
00:50:06,491 --> 00:50:10,504
Scott: Yeah, I liked it a lot too, but I think spirited away had a few things on it.

722
00:50:10,906 --> 00:50:11,969
Scott: Hmm like little.

723
00:50:11,989 --> 00:50:14,518
Scott: well Let's see house moving castle had the fire.

724
00:50:14,639 --> 00:50:19,554
Scott: That's really like a huge trump card right there But it's pretty.

725
00:50:19,574 --> 00:50:24,349
Scott: we had a little footballs and I think the story made a little bit more sense.

726
00:50:25,632 --> 00:50:27,640
Scott: You know stuff like that now.

727
00:50:27,701 --> 00:50:33,030
Rym: honestly if I had to pick my favorite anime movie ever I left a list too because one of them is fairly fairly recent.

728
00:50:33,493 --> 00:50:39,090
Rym: So I want to give a nod to the old movie that I like as well Because the old movie was kind of knocked out of the first place position recently.

729
00:50:40,012 --> 00:50:45,917
Rym: my favorite anime movie prior to the second one is Lupin the third castle of Cagliostro.

730
00:50:45,937 --> 00:50:46,960
Rym: Oh Lupin.

731
00:50:47,321 --> 00:50:48,002
Scott: Oh, man.

732
00:50:48,243 --> 00:50:50,990
Rym: Yeah, I mean, I love every Lupin movie.

733
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:52,452
Rym: Oh, yeah crappiest crap.

734
00:50:52,492 --> 00:50:59,995
Rym: Lupin movie Babylon gold is on my list of good anime and it's really close between the fuma conspiracy and Cagliostro.

735
00:51:00,035 --> 00:51:02,190
Rym: those are both like the prime of Lupin.

736
00:51:02,732 --> 00:51:06,809
Rym: But I think Cagliostro edges out just a little bit just because of the scene at the end.

737
00:51:07,612 --> 00:51:11,729
Rym: Not gonna spoil anything, but the last scene in that movie just brings a little man tear to your eye.

738
00:51:12,612 --> 00:51:25,758
Scott: Yeah, Cagliostro is real good and I really like Lupin, but I think fuma conspiracy I like more because Cagliostro is like just missing some of those like Lupin Elements that all the other Lupin movies have.

739
00:51:26,039 --> 00:51:27,885
Rym: well Cagliostro was a little more serious.

740
00:51:28,186 --> 00:51:35,768
Scott: Yeah, it was more serious And you know while more serious, I think makes it a better movie It doesn't make it a more favorite movie of mine, you know.

741
00:51:36,612 --> 00:51:40,910
Rym: Yeah, I can see where you're coming from and I got to admit this isn't a spoiler because it happens immediately.

742
00:51:41,492 --> 00:51:44,722
Rym: Fuma conspiracy the main thing going on in that movie.

743
00:51:44,762 --> 00:51:47,070
Rym: Is that going on gets married?

744
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:50,129
Rym: If you don't know who going on is that doesn't mean anything to you.

745
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:54,245
Scott: But if you do if you don't know who go mine is why haven't you seen a new upon?

746
00:51:54,606 --> 00:51:55,710
Rym: Yeah, we'll talk to us.

747
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:56,695
Rym: We'll give you some movies.

748
00:51:56,795 --> 00:51:57,358
Rym: I mean Dan.

749
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:04,410
Scott: Yeah, you need to see every Lupin movie and Probably the TV show as much as you can and at least the movies.

750
00:52:04,471 --> 00:52:05,990
Rym: I think the movies are better than the TV show.

751
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:11,310
Rym: Yeah, the movies are where it's at and even if you hate Lupin Castle Cagliostro is an amazing movie.

752
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:12,581
Scott: Oh, yeah, if you don't.

753
00:52:12,722 --> 00:52:17,010
Scott: even if you don't like Lupin Cagliostro, like I said doesn't have all the Lupin things in it.

754
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:18,416
Scott: It's more serious and whatever.

755
00:52:18,497 --> 00:52:30,786
Rym: so plus it has one of the best lines in any show ever With your sword and my anti-tank rifle, yep dot dot dot Yep, but I got to say both movies were edged out recently by the place promised in our early days.

756
00:52:30,806 --> 00:52:32,454
Scott: I Don't know.

757
00:52:32,474 --> 00:52:34,028
Scott: I don't like police promise that much.

758
00:52:34,351 --> 00:52:37,930
Rym: I don't know why the show affected me so much this movie, but I just loved it.

759
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:38,532
Rym: It was just.

760
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:42,006
Rym: this movie has the saddest happy moment.

761
00:52:42,086 --> 00:52:42,849
Rym: I've ever seen.

762
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:45,279
Rym: Imagine a scene where nothing bad happens.

763
00:52:45,339 --> 00:52:47,869
Rym: In fact only good things happen, but it's still sad.

764
00:52:49,271 --> 00:52:56,215
Rym: Yeah, it did have that and I just think it was generally a very good atmospheric Well-drawn well-done movie.

765
00:52:56,836 --> 00:52:57,077
Scott: Yep.

766
00:52:57,157 --> 00:52:57,959
Scott: It was all those things.

767
00:52:58,581 --> 00:52:59,122
Scott: I won't deny.

768
00:52:59,142 --> 00:53:00,586
Scott: All right, so I just didn't.

769
00:53:00,606 --> 00:53:05,203
Scott: I Know I actually liked the other work by the same guy.

770
00:53:05,243 --> 00:53:05,685
Scott: What was it?

771
00:53:06,106 --> 00:53:06,950
Rym: Oh a Hoshi no Koi.

772
00:53:07,091 --> 00:53:09,230
Scott: Yeah, I like that a lot more and it wasn't even a whole movie.

773
00:53:09,411 --> 00:53:11,910
Rym: See I like that one, but I liked it a lot less than this one.

774
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:16,196
Scott: No, I liked Hoshi no Koi the most this one because I'd seen Hoshi no Koi.

775
00:53:16,236 --> 00:53:22,935
Scott: a lot of this was Hoshi no Koi ish You know, it just seemed a little more Slower and dragged out.

776
00:53:23,015 --> 00:53:25,222
Rym: and see what were you say slower and dragged out.

777
00:53:25,383 --> 00:53:30,149
Scott: I say atmospheric and yeah That's all point of view type of thing.

778
00:53:30,379 --> 00:53:31,754
Rym: Yeah I mean we have different tastes.

779
00:53:32,035 --> 00:53:37,093
Rym: Scott likes the giant robots a lot more than me and I like the show Joe crap as he Would call it.

780
00:53:37,435 --> 00:53:40,050
Scott: I don't like the giant robots because they're giant robots.

781
00:53:40,471 --> 00:53:46,310
Rym: Shows that have giant robots happen to have be the type that you don't like giant robo, which I think is awesome.

782
00:53:46,652 --> 00:53:47,338
Scott: Yeah, I don't like it.

783
00:53:47,761 --> 00:53:48,829
Rym: I don't it's awesome.

784
00:53:49,472 --> 00:53:50,274
Scott: No, it's like.

785
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:55,030
Scott: giant robo is a lot more like Astro Boy than it is like other than macross or anything.

786
00:53:55,271 --> 00:53:57,778
Scott: All right, it just happens to have giant robots.

787
00:53:58,140 --> 00:53:59,805
Rym: All right, so I've listed place promised.

788
00:53:59,825 --> 00:54:01,410
Rym: What's your favorite non-loupon?

789
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:02,193
Rym: Animated movie.

790
00:54:02,354 --> 00:54:03,784
Scott: I'm the part anime movie.

791
00:54:03,904 --> 00:54:04,529
Scott: Oh, it's real hard.

792
00:54:05,373 --> 00:54:07,622
Scott: The Pat LeBourne movies are really really good.

793
00:54:07,843 --> 00:54:09,450
Rym: Yeah, I don't like him that much but they're good.

794
00:54:09,731 --> 00:54:16,520
Scott: I think the second one is the best one and I mean well Akira is really good.

795
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:19,330
Scott: But once you read the manga, it doesn't feel so good anymore.

796
00:54:19,410 --> 00:54:23,490
Scott: It's like when I saw Akira before and I'd only seen a few other anime movies.

797
00:54:24,253 --> 00:54:28,550
Scott: It was kind of like whoa my god, but then once you read the manga, it's like yeah that movies not so much.

798
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:33,069
Scott: Yep, now the beginning of the movie beginning the first half of Akira is the best anime movie.

799
00:54:34,336 --> 00:54:39,830
Scott: The second half The second half of the Akira movie is not the best anime movie ever.

800
00:54:40,132 --> 00:54:42,290
Rym: I gotta give a big nod to the ghost in the shell movies.

801
00:54:42,591 --> 00:54:46,330
Rym: Yeah, because they I mean one goes to the first one a lot more than the second one.

802
00:54:46,470 --> 00:54:48,741
Rym: Yeah, I like the second one a lot for a lot of reasons.

803
00:54:48,761 --> 00:54:49,685
Rym: I mean, it was really pretty.

804
00:54:49,705 --> 00:54:55,503
Rym: it got me For any of you who have seen it that scene where you thought the movie was broken.

805
00:54:56,205 --> 00:54:56,827
Rym: that got me.

806
00:54:57,148 --> 00:55:01,923
Rym: Yeah, and I liked seeing a lot like just kind of a look into Bato's life.

807
00:55:01,943 --> 00:55:02,486
Rym: Mm-hmm.

808
00:55:02,847 --> 00:55:03,510
Rym: I like that a lot.

809
00:55:03,791 --> 00:55:06,521
Scott: Yeah, Bato, it's like the major is just totally.

810
00:55:06,541 --> 00:55:08,790
Scott: if you want to know about her you can read the manga.

811
00:55:09,031 --> 00:55:13,410
Scott: So the fact that they focus on the other characters and the TV show in the movies is awesome.

812
00:55:13,784 --> 00:55:17,243
Rym: Yeah Cuz you see Bato and he's got his dog and he's got his life and it's just.

813
00:55:17,343 --> 00:55:23,670
Rym: I really like that movie and I I guess The two of the ghost in the shell movies together would be very very high in my list as an entity.

814
00:55:23,791 --> 00:55:25,308
Scott: That's got to be a high on anyone's list.

815
00:55:26,931 --> 00:55:28,418
Scott: The Galaxy Express like.

816
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:33,060
Scott: I would have said that was the best but then re-watching it I mean, it's still really good, but I don't it does.

817
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:34,790
Scott: it's not the same as it was before.

818
00:55:35,471 --> 00:55:36,115
Rym: Yeah, though.

819
00:55:36,135 --> 00:55:37,725
Rym: We're watching a lot of that stuff now.

820
00:55:37,745 --> 00:55:44,079
Scott: Yeah It's like my memory of watching the ghost in the Galaxy Express movie the first time would be like the best.

821
00:55:44,179 --> 00:55:47,700
Rym: but oh Yeah, that completely chart.

822
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:49,750
Rym: because I said place promised and Lupin movies.

823
00:55:50,071 --> 00:55:52,101
Rym: But there's one other anime movie that like it.

824
00:55:52,322 --> 00:55:53,528
Rym: it's tied with all of them.

825
00:55:53,568 --> 00:55:56,239
Rym: to me It's eraser at Sura to beautiful.

826
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:57,444
Scott: Oh, you like that one.

827
00:55:57,745 --> 00:55:58,910
Rym: Well, I like you're a say at Sura.

828
00:55:59,233 --> 00:56:00,489
Rym: I just think it's cute and funny.

829
00:56:00,913 --> 00:56:03,050
Rym: But the thing is for anyone doesn't know the story and I'll be real brief.

830
00:56:03,572 --> 00:56:08,330
Rym: The second movie there are five or six movies and the second movie was done by different people.

831
00:56:08,713 --> 00:56:10,670
Rym: In fact, it got licensed by a different company.

832
00:56:11,071 --> 00:56:21,143
Rym: So you can buy a box set that has one three four five six and then you can buy two by itself and there's a hole To stick it in in the other box Mm-hmm, and I guess it is.

833
00:56:21,263 --> 00:56:26,129
Rym: it is just a very good Screen representation of how dreams work.

834
00:56:27,296 --> 00:56:38,181
Rym: That may sound weird But it's a good movie like a really good movie and I saw it on the sci-fi channel way way back and to this day I still consider it one of my favorite movies ever animated or otherwise.

835
00:56:38,582 --> 00:56:38,783
Rym: Yeah.

836
00:56:39,364 --> 00:56:41,571
Scott: Well, you also like that whatever tenchi movie It was.

837
00:56:41,591 --> 00:56:47,775
Rym: I like the first tenchi movie tenchi muyo in love because it's just cute funny happy whatever You know.

838
00:56:47,835 --> 00:56:49,746
Scott: early watch and I watched it.

839
00:56:49,826 --> 00:56:50,309
Scott: It was lame.

840
00:56:51,232 --> 00:56:53,970
Rym: No, that was the second one I had you watch because it's only an hour long.

841
00:56:54,211 --> 00:56:54,572
Scott: Oh, okay.

842
00:56:54,773 --> 00:56:57,907
Rym: The second one is kind of a. the third one is just a freaking doujinshi.

843
00:56:57,947 --> 00:56:59,433
Rym: as far as I'm concerned It's just terrible.

844
00:56:59,453 --> 00:56:59,976
Rym: Mm-hmm.

845
00:57:00,839 --> 00:57:03,390
Scott: Yeah, I don't really know anything or care.

846
00:57:03,651 --> 00:57:13,563
Rym: Yeah for any of you who like all those like, you know modern harem shows like I don't know love Hina Tenchi muyo is the original Yeah, the creator of the harem to show.

847
00:57:13,624 --> 00:57:14,268
Scott: Thank you very much.

848
00:57:15,191 --> 00:57:17,950
Scott: Thanks for bringing these terrible types of shows into the world.

849
00:57:18,071 --> 00:57:19,838
Rym: It's okay to have one of any kind of show.

850
00:57:19,898 --> 00:57:22,510
Rym: the problem is when people keep trying to make that show over and over again.

851
00:57:22,791 --> 00:57:25,480
Scott: No, the problem is when that type of show is a nasty harem show.

852
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:28,350
Rym: I thought it was funny and generally heartwarming.

853
00:57:29,231 --> 00:57:30,294
Scott: I thought it was a harem.

854
00:57:30,956 --> 00:57:32,120
Rym: You haven't really seen much of it.

855
00:57:32,902 --> 00:57:33,564
Scott: I saw enough.

856
00:57:33,965 --> 00:57:35,530
Rym: No, you didn't I seen enough.

857
00:57:37,031 --> 00:57:38,817
Scott: I'm not about to go seek out anymore.

858
00:57:38,837 --> 00:57:39,359
Scott: That's for sure.

859
00:57:40,101 --> 00:57:44,252
Scott: Oh, oh, oh, I just remembered an anime movie I like a whole lot.

860
00:57:44,532 --> 00:57:47,957
Scott: Oh like just as much as the Pat LeVoir movies and spirited away.

861
00:57:47,977 --> 00:57:51,433
Rym: All right, Tokyo Godfathers I forgot about that.

862
00:57:51,453 --> 00:57:53,862
Scott: I like it a lot a whole lot.

863
00:57:53,922 --> 00:57:56,210
Scott: like I could watch that thing a hundred times.

864
00:57:56,832 --> 00:57:58,860
Rym: Oh my it's not in my top ten list.

865
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:01,430
Rym: Like I list every movie I mentioned so far above that one.

866
00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:03,938
