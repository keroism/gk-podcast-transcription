1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,749
Rym: It's Thursday, July 15th, 2021.

2
00:00:09,749 --> 00:00:10,050
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,249 --> 00:00:13,660
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,341 --> 00:00:15,691
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,732 --> 00:00:19,859
Rym: Tonight, we're talking about counterfeits, bootlegs, and illegitimate goods.

6
00:00:21,481 --> 00:00:22,497
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:25,872 --> 00:00:26,630
Scott: Warm, Diddy.

8
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:28,401
Rym: Warm, indeed.

9
00:00:28,421 --> 00:00:33,470
Scott: I, uh- Finally a warm day, but of course it's a day where I gotta fuckin' work and I can't go to the beach or whatever.

10
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:41,450
Rym: Yup, but at least, so, in pre-COVID times, like, I would bike to work unless I had to, like, be dressed up extra fancy for, like, a special meeting or something.

11
00:00:41,712 --> 00:00:43,329
Rym: I'd bike to work every day, use my own bike.

12
00:00:43,871 --> 00:00:53,050
Rym: But, uh, in COVID times, once I start, like, nowadays, it's kind of a pain in the ass with all the protocols they've got at work to, like, bring my bike and use the bike loading dock.

13
00:00:53,432 --> 00:00:56,568
Rym: So I've been using the city bikes instead of, you know, taking my real bike.

14
00:00:57,771 --> 00:01:08,050
Rym: Also because my building, like, years ago, people freaked out about, I guess, theoretically, supposedly, someone's bike got stolen from the bike room, which, frankly, I don't even care.

15
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:15,430
Rym: But because of that, the building, like, I have to talk to the doorman and they have to, like, buzz me in and it's also a pain in the ass, so the city bike's just better.

16
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,410
Rym: But because it's so hot, I've been using those e-bikes pretty much every day to and from work.

17
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,234
Rym: And I gotta say- Using the e-bike?

18
00:01:22,274 --> 00:01:23,623
Scott: I just use the- I've never used the e-bike.

19
00:01:23,643 --> 00:01:24,630
Scott: I just keep using the regular one.

20
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,188
Scott: Why would I pay money for the e-one?

21
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,830
Rym: So, the reason I use the e-one is only for commuting.

22
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:32,950
Rym: Is that, uh, and usually, I actually only use it on the way to work.

23
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,449
Rym: On the way home, I use a regular bike.

24
00:01:35,371 --> 00:01:37,980
Scott: I got nothing against the e-one, it's just.

25
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:47,350
Scott: I don't need to use the e-one, I can use the regular one, so why should- I could, but I'm usually wearing, like, pants and a real shirt because I'm going to an office- Why are you wearing pants and a shirt when it's warm?

26
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,689
Rym: Because of the kind of job I have.

27
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,010
Scott: So, I can't, like- I would just show up in shorts and t-shirts.

28
00:01:53,070 --> 00:02:07,488
Rym: So, riding a regular city bike, I'll be a little sweaty coming into work and I don't always want to be, but the thing about the e-bike, I realized, that taking it to work, it costs about half what a MetroCard swipe would and it is five-

29
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:10,080
Scott: Well, that's on top of the price.

30
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,810
Scott: If you didn't have the annual pass, it wouldn't cost.

31
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:16,270
Rym: Ah, but I have the annual pass because I use regular city bikes all the time in my regular life.

32
00:02:16,731 --> 00:02:24,570
Rym: So, it's basically free because I'm paying for it anyway, but the e-bike is just objectively better than the subway unless it's raining.

33
00:02:25,935 --> 00:02:26,810
Rym: Or, like, super cold.

34
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,930
Scott: As long as you're going somewhere the subway goes.

35
00:02:29,011 --> 00:02:29,273
Rym: Yeah.

36
00:02:29,779 --> 00:02:31,938
Scott: So, basically- Or somewhere the city bike goes.

37
00:02:31,978 --> 00:02:33,710
Scott: The subway goes more places than the city bike does.

38
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:34,010
Rym: Yup.

39
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:40,470
Rym: So, I'm using these e-bikes to go to work so I don't have to huff and puff with a giant fucking city bike over the Queensborough bridge.

40
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,750
Scott: You know, the other way to avoid huffing and puffing is just bike slower.

41
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:44,930
Scott: Nah, I'm not willing to do that.

42
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,829
Scott: You seem to be incapable of doing that.

43
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:47,534
Rym: No, fuck that.

44
00:02:47,836 --> 00:02:50,130
Rym: If I'm not going, like, 15 miles an hour, I'm not happy.

45
00:02:50,991 --> 00:02:51,757
Scott: I just go,

46
00:02:51,817 --> 00:02:53,308
Scott: "Doop-doop-doop-doop-doop-doop-doop-doop-doop.".

47
00:02:53,711 --> 00:02:56,410
Rym: You've seen my Strava's when I went, like, Emily and I were out joyriding.

48
00:02:57,432 --> 00:02:58,259
Scott: I just go,

49
00:02:58,279 --> 00:02:59,408
Scott: "Doop-doop-doop-doop-doop.".

50
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:14,569
Rym: So, in the last three times I've gone over the Queensborough bridge on my way to or from work, so yesterday coming home, today going to, and today coming home, I want to see what your guess would be.

51
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:24,190
Rym: How many times was I passed on the Queensborough bridge by a motorcycle that was gasoline-powered in the bike lane?

52
00:03:24,912 --> 00:03:26,650
Scott: Probably at least five or six times.

53
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,108
Rym: Exactly six times.

54
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:29,132
Scott: Alright.

55
00:03:29,698 --> 00:03:30,830
Scott: Yeah, they use them all the time.

56
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:37,950
Rym: They gotta do something about that, especially considering that traffic in New York City is literally the worst it's ever been in history right now.

57
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:40,458
Scott: I mean, listen, it's like, yes, I agree.

58
00:03:40,538 --> 00:03:48,330
Scott: Technically, you know, you're not supposed to be using, you know, that vehicle should be in the driving area and not in the, but, you know, you're right.

59
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:53,050
Rym: I'm totally cool with it, but gas-powered two-stroke engines should not be in that space.

60
00:03:53,351 --> 00:04:05,490
Scott: Yeah, of course, you're right, but that problem is so insignificant compared to the real problem, which is, right, that person is there not because you're punishing that person, it doesn't help you, right?

61
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:10,410
Scott: You need to, the only, because you need to, that person is there because a car has pushed them there.

62
00:04:10,771 --> 00:04:13,470
Scott: They feel safer in there than they do over with the car.

63
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,084
Rym: So, the problem though, so...

64
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:16,769
Scott: Punishing them does nothing, right?

65
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:17,910
Rym: So, here's my, these are not...

66
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:21,390
Scott: Even if cops were good and were, you know, it's like, there's no point.

67
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:28,307
Rym: So, here's the thing though, these are not, like, these instances, I'm not talking about, like, little putt-putt, like, the kids... Yeah, I know, yeah, I know.

68
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:38,610
Rym: But what happened to me three times just recently, one of them was on my home just now, it was a full-size motorcycle honking and, like, driving fast on that bike lane.

69
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:44,990
Scott: Yeah, yeah, but that, if the cars, if the cars were lessened, that person wouldn't be there.

70
00:04:45,513 --> 00:04:46,790
Rym: I don't know, actually.

71
00:04:46,991 --> 00:04:48,295
Scott: I don't blame that person.

72
00:04:49,499 --> 00:04:55,426
Scott: That's such a small, insignificant problem compared to the... How many lanes of cars are over there?

73
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,390
Rym: Well, you gotta get rid of all those lanes of cars.

74
00:04:57,931 --> 00:04:58,578
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

75
00:04:58,618 --> 00:04:59,670
Scott: That's the real problem.

76
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:04,510
Scott: I'm not gonna go be blaming, like, this, you know, sort of side effect.

77
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:09,828
Scott: That's, like, one motorcycle guy when there's thousands and thousands of cars right fucking there, right?

78
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:10,708
Rym: Yep.

79
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:13,178
Rym: But it is a very narrow path.

80
00:05:13,218 --> 00:05:19,209
Rym: Granted, that'll be a little less bad when they actually make it bikes only and get rid of the pedestrian access, which is supposedly coming this year.

81
00:05:20,271 --> 00:05:21,355
Scott: Yeah.

82
00:05:21,435 --> 00:05:25,250
Scott: But, yeah, no, I mean, there was actually two, two, some things going around recently.

83
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:31,290
Scott: One of them was, like, look, you know, evidence shows in this, you know, one study each, but, you know, whatever.

84
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:38,690
Scott: One study was, like, yeah, increasing cop enforcement doesn't actually reduce the number of crashes.

85
00:05:38,851 --> 00:05:42,210
Rym: Oh, yeah, because I saw a bunch of other articles talking about that.

86
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:47,707
Scott: And the second one, the second one was, like, actually camera enforcement.

87
00:05:47,727 --> 00:05:49,516
Scott: that's on all the time and just tickets.

88
00:05:49,576 --> 00:05:50,503
Scott: every single person does.

89
00:05:52,431 --> 00:05:52,632
Rym: Yeah.

90
00:05:52,873 --> 00:05:55,910
Rym: I mean, even from a naive analysis, think of it this way.

91
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:07,950
Rym: What percentage of people who are flagrantly violating very objectively easy to observe traffic rules like running stop signs and red lights don't get ticketed because there is an absolute enforcement.

92
00:06:08,272 --> 00:06:12,070
Rym: So the odds are you'll get ticketed so infrequently that there's no deterrent effect.

93
00:06:13,032 --> 00:06:16,767
Scott: So this is why I say you should defund the police, which don't increase safety.

94
00:06:18,231 --> 00:06:31,130
Rym: Like I said, every stop sign and red light in New York City should have 100 percent enforcement with no exceptions via technology, and the police should not be able to chase anyone or interact with someone in person for those violations.

95
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:31,990
Rym: They're just mailed tickets.

96
00:06:32,171 --> 00:06:38,470
Scott: And the penalties should not be just these fines because a fine is a price.

97
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,068
Scott: It means a rich person can still do it.

98
00:06:40,891 --> 00:06:46,208
Scott: The penalty should be you're not allowed to drive ever again and we confiscate all your cars and you're not allowed to buy a car.

99
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:49,089
Scott: And if we catch you driving, then we kill you.

100
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:49,572
Scott: I don't know.

101
00:06:49,652 --> 00:06:52,789
Scott: Something really horrible that would make you... I don't know.

102
00:06:53,912 --> 00:06:58,130
Scott: I don't know what to do about someone who has lost their license and drives anymore.

103
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:08,850
Rym: This is something, I don't know if it's still true, but I remember growing up in Michigan, most people who were getting pulled over for drunk driving had suspended licenses for drunk driving.

104
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:15,610
Rym: And they just keep driving and no amount of consequences will stop them from driving short of putting them in jail.

105
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,001
Scott: Well, I mean, that's the fault.

106
00:07:17,021 --> 00:07:17,850
Scott: They're living in Michigan.

107
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,089
Rym: Take away their car, they get another car.

108
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,310
Scott: Yeah, that person, it's not their fault.

109
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:25,406
Scott: I mean, they shouldn't be drunk driving, but it's not their fault.

110
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:31,170
Scott: The fault is they're stuck in a place where if they don't have a car and drive, they can't go anywhere.

111
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:35,789
Scott: But they also choose to drive drunk so frequently that they get pulled over repeatedly.

112
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:45,370
Scott: So any consequence that you administer by pulling them over or ticketing them is not worse than the consequence of you can't go anywhere.

113
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:59,370
Scott: So in order to make them, it's like you either have to make it a place where they can go places without the car, then they'll be like, oh, OK, why would I, you know, there's no way to go anywhere.

114
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:07,990
Rym: We'll just get on that with a deadlocked impossible to change Senate and the 40 years of infrastructure investments necessary to do that, even just in the orbit of major cities.

115
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:14,489
Scott: If you had some fucking guts, like some people from Texas have some guts, right, then maybe something would happen.

116
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,769
Rym: Yeah, actually, that's the news we could talk about.

117
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:21,950
Rym: So if you're not aware, American politics is, of course, super fucked up.

118
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:24,870
Rym: We basically have fascists on one side and a coalition.

119
00:08:25,011 --> 00:08:27,030
Scott: It's been super, I mean, it's been super fucked up.

120
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:33,070
Scott: It's just, you know, there's more realization and, you know, consequences of the fucked upness happening.

121
00:08:34,071 --> 00:08:34,273
Rym: Yep.

122
00:08:34,595 --> 00:08:36,850
Rym: But one thing that's happened specifically.

123
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,328
Scott: At what point was it not fucked up?

124
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:48,850
Rym: And recently, and this is this is kind of an amazing, this is the kind of thing that, you know, when people say a lot of Americans who are on the left and the reasonable positions also don't understand our government that well.

125
00:08:49,254 --> 00:08:50,169
Rym: So they'll get mad.

126
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,110
Scott: People in general don't understand our government that well.

127
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:56,990
Rym: Why doesn't Pelosi, the Speaker of the House, do X or why doesn't the president, Joe Biden, do Y?

128
00:08:57,352 --> 00:09:00,650
Rym: And usually the answer is that's not actually within their powers.

129
00:09:01,072 --> 00:09:02,308
Rym: That's not something they can do.

130
00:09:03,691 --> 00:09:09,610
Scott: It's within their power if they act in a Trumpian way and just ignore what's within their power and do things anyway.

131
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,130
Rym: No, no, no, because there's a fundamental problem there.

132
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:17,690
Rym: The Trumpian way was usually preventing something from happening or making something happen badly.

133
00:09:18,092 --> 00:09:21,790
Rym: Making something actively happen is usually not possible.

134
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:32,110
Rym: And that's sort of the word, which is so happens that the bad side in America almost exclusively wants to prevent things from changing or break things.

135
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:37,710
Scott: So we can let's at least find the things that we want to stop from happening and stop them from happening.

136
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:38,792
Scott: Right.

137
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:39,234
Rym: Oh, yeah.

138
00:09:39,354 --> 00:09:43,750
Rym: And that's actually I think Biden signed more executive orders than like any modern president.

139
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:49,030
Rym: But when people say like, oh, why don't the Democrats do the crazy option?

140
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:55,490
Rym: They kind of already are in in many cases where like the crazy option, they're doing as much as they legally can.

141
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,250
Rym: And they're not at the point where they're going to start throwing bricks.

142
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:09,070
Rym: So in the state of Texas, which is a fucked up state that was formed due to a land grab where we basically stole a bunch of land from Mexico in order to protect slavery and the Alamo is a farce.

143
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:23,170
Rym: But I digress is going to pass extreme voting restrictions, like the kind of voting restrictions that arguably end democracy in Texas and threaten the ability of like a Democrat to ever win a statewide election and all sorts of nonsense.

144
00:10:25,171 --> 00:10:31,050
Rym: The Democrats in the state legislature of Texas are doing the crazy thing.

145
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:33,281
Rym: What they did is they fled the state.

146
00:10:33,663 --> 00:10:34,426
Rym: They went to D.C.

147
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,170
Rym: and they're in hiding.

148
00:10:35,772 --> 00:10:41,947
Rym: So now the state legislature cannot have a quorum to vote on this bill.

149
00:10:41,987 --> 00:10:43,090
Rym: that will destroy democracy.

150
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,056
Scott: And they also can't change.

151
00:10:45,116 --> 00:10:46,060
Scott: They also can't change.

152
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,310
Scott: They don't have enough people to change the rules about quorums.

153
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,772
Rym: Exactly.

154
00:10:49,792 --> 00:10:56,930
Rym: So the consequence of this, though, is that those Democrats will be arrested if and when they ever return to Texas.

155
00:10:58,211 --> 00:11:05,490
Rym: The governor has actually ordered their arrest because their governor is a super piece of shit fascist who really wants these voting restrictions to be in place.

156
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:10,550
Rym: So that is the level of politics we've got going on in America right now.

157
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:18,189
Rym: I'm not going to give you the play by play on that whole story, but I highly recommend you read about that in particular, because that's what you do.

158
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:21,236
Scott: You could do a similar thing in the U.S.

159
00:11:21,296 --> 00:11:26,570
Scott: Senate if you, you know, some Republican senators just couldn't find their way to the Senate somehow.

160
00:11:28,632 --> 00:11:30,964
Scott: There just happened to be, what is it, 10 we need missing?

161
00:11:30,964 --> 00:11:32,650
Scott: 10, I think, to get 60?

162
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,253
Rym: So it's a little bit.

163
00:11:34,614 --> 00:11:43,130
Rym: Quorum in the Senate is a little more complicated, but you need, you may effectively need 60 affirmative votes to bring something forward.

164
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:44,231
Scott: Right.

165
00:11:44,311 --> 00:11:45,877
Scott: OK, so you got, you got what, at least 48.

166
00:11:45,877 --> 00:11:46,299
Scott: Right.

167
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,888
Scott: So let's get let's get 12 just to be safe.

168
00:11:48,888 --> 00:11:49,951
Scott: 13.

169
00:11:49,951 --> 00:11:53,770
Scott: How hard is it for 13 old white dudes to have a hard time?

170
00:11:56,951 --> 00:12:08,050
Scott: How hard can that be to arrange when you say command the largest military on earth and a secret service and, you know, let's actually, people always spread these conspiracies.

171
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,613
Scott: Why not do a real one?

172
00:12:10,035 --> 00:12:15,570
Scott: If you can have a CIA start a bunch of revolutions, everyone know you've done it, but there's no consequences.

173
00:12:15,811 --> 00:12:20,583
Scott: Oh, well, have a CIA, you know, delay 13 old white dudes.

174
00:12:20,643 --> 00:12:22,588
Scott: Everyone knows you did it, but no consequences.

175
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:23,430
Scott: Same thing, right?

176
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,809
Rym: Wait till they wait till they go poop because they probably all poop at the exact same time every day.

177
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:29,790
Scott: That's way less bad than overthrowing countries that aren't even your country.

178
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,610
Rym: Just telling you, wait till they poop at their scheduled time and lock them in the bathroom.

179
00:12:34,392 --> 00:12:34,637
Scott: Yeah.

180
00:12:35,044 --> 00:12:35,370
Rym: Anyway.

181
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:52,350
Rym: But yeah, if you live in America and you're not in Texas, your local politicians, they're the ones you can pressure to do this kind of shit, because usually there are a lot more interesting loopholes to exploit at the state and municipal level than there are at the federal level.

182
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:59,430
Scott: And of course, in the exact spot where I live, every single small representative that I have is already about as left as can be.

183
00:12:59,530 --> 00:12:59,638
Scott: Yep.

184
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:03,850
Scott: I'm represented in the state by outright socialists.

185
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:11,808
Rym: I mean, even at the federal level, Maloney, my rap, not the most progressive, but also going hard against the Republicans.

186
00:13:11,828 --> 00:13:12,530
Rym: Like, she's not bad.

187
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:19,364
Scott: Well, she's one of those, well, you know, she's one of those ones where, you know, she sort of goes with, she went with the flow, right?

188
00:13:19,405 --> 00:13:21,970
Scott: She saw things moving to the left and she moved to the left.

189
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:22,372
Scott: You know what?

190
00:13:22,493 --> 00:13:24,002
Rym: I don't care why someone gets there.

191
00:13:24,042 --> 00:13:25,290
Rym: They just got to get there at this point.

192
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,710
Scott: We're still voting against her in the primary.

193
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:28,394
Rym: Oh, of course.

194
00:13:28,434 --> 00:13:32,350
Scott: I mean, I will always vote for- We have an actual, there's an actual socialist who's trying to primary.

195
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:35,983
Rym: I will always vote for the most radical progressive in any primary, because why not?

196
00:13:36,224 --> 00:13:37,810
Rym: Worst case, they don't get the nomination.

197
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:44,230
Rym: And also, as the number of people who vote that way in the primaries grow, that pulls the rest of them a little bit further.

198
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:49,809
Scott: But there's no point in me calling any of my at least smaller rep- I mean, I guess I can call the state senators.

199
00:13:49,849 --> 00:13:50,871
Rym: They need- But that's the problem.

200
00:13:51,132 --> 00:14:09,350
Rym: We live in, like, if you live in a state that's doing okay, you have no influence on the federal government because a senator in America from a state you don't live in not only gives zero fucks what you think, but if you call them, they will use the evidence that people from out of state are calling them as an excuse to ignore popular will and actually do the thing that's unpopular.

201
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,097
Scott: Well, it's like, even if- and it's like, what?

202
00:14:11,137 --> 00:14:12,042
Scott: If I call Schumer, what?

203
00:14:12,062 --> 00:14:12,746
Scott: He's like, "Okay,

204
00:14:12,928 --> 00:14:13,169
Scott: yes.".

205
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:13,550
Scott: Yeah.

206
00:14:14,352 --> 00:14:16,536
Rym: No, I think I wrote a letter to Schumer a while ago.

207
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:18,580
Rym: I was mad about, like, something.

208
00:14:18,621 --> 00:14:22,128
Rym: I wanted a January 6th commission, and his response was basically, "So do

209
00:14:22,408 --> 00:14:22,428
Rym: I!".

210
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:23,887
Rym: Mm-hmm.

211
00:14:24,852 --> 00:14:26,685
Rym: I co-sponsored all these things that you want.

212
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:27,148
Rym: Here you go.

213
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:29,668
Scott: Keep voting for me.

214
00:14:30,071 --> 00:14:30,311
Rym: Yep.

215
00:14:30,672 --> 00:14:32,738
Rym: And before anyone says, "Well, why don't you move to West

216
00:14:32,758 --> 00:14:33,159
Rym: Virginia?".

217
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:37,270
Rym: No one should have to move to a shitty place to make the place they live better.

218
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:38,515
Rym: Mm-hmm.

219
00:14:39,471 --> 00:14:41,990
Rym: Anyway, you got some news about bowling balls, it looks like here.

220
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:43,151
Scott: I do.

221
00:14:43,252 --> 00:14:50,710
Scott: So apparently, in New York, you know, people- I don't know if you haven't heard about the world of recycling, right?

222
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:52,894
Scott: But there's plenty of exposés out there.

223
00:14:52,935 --> 00:15:00,029
Scott: you can read about the realities of recycling in various places and how a lot of stuff you recycle just ends up in the trash, et cetera, et cetera, right?

224
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:07,210
Scott: You know, industry is really responsible for climate change more than we are, et cetera, as consumers, yada, yada.

225
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:18,270
Scott: But this particular story, right, was quite interesting from a different angle, is that at the recycling center in New York City, a few bowling balls show up about every day.

226
00:15:19,332 --> 00:15:22,684
Scott: Just a few bowling balls a day, so like 1,000 something, 1,200ish balls a year, they get there, right?

227
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,795
Scott: People think they can recycle a bowling ball.

228
00:15:26,815 --> 00:15:28,820
Scott: You got this bowling ball, right?

229
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:32,610
Scott: Maybe it's broken, maybe you just don't use it anymore, you can't sell it, you can't give it away.

230
00:15:34,511 --> 00:15:40,450
Scott: And, you know, you feel bad just throwing it out because it's such a large, heavy, not necessarily inexpensive object.

231
00:15:41,851 --> 00:15:45,830
Scott: And it's like, so you recycle it to feel better about yourself, but they can't fucking recycle the bowling ball.

232
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,592
Scott: So they got too many fucking bowling balls there.

233
00:15:49,193 --> 00:16:01,890
Scott: And then, so it's like, I just think that's really fascinating because it always reminds me of my often repeated anecdote about the bowling ball, where you, my friends that bought the bowling ball, you think you're gonna get involved in some hobby, right?

234
00:16:02,311 --> 00:16:07,810
Scott: And then you don't, and now you've got this hobby equipment that you bought that you don't use, right, lying around.

235
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:09,635
Scott: And I always say, you know, don't buy a bowling ball.

236
00:16:09,655 --> 00:16:15,490
Scott: If you're gonna buy equipment for your hobby, make sure you're actually gonna do that hobby and you're not just gonna buy a bicycle and not ride it.

237
00:16:15,971 --> 00:16:18,237
Scott: That would be a bowling ball, metaphorically speaking.

238
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:22,188
Scott: And here's literal bowling balls showing up at the recycling center, three a day, right?

239
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:27,548
Scott: So people are making this mistake en masse, right, of buying hobby equipment and not using it.

240
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:38,490
Scott: And yeah, it was fascinating because in the article I learned about bowling balls and how, like, the ultra bowling balls, like, only get so much use, like, the ultra pro ones.

241
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:43,590
Scott: And there's one, like, there's really good ones, but they crack, so the pros keep going through ball after ball.

242
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:50,630
Scott: How they make the bowling balls without holes and then, you know, you buy a bowling ball with no holes in it and then they drill the holes for you, right?

243
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:52,298
Scott: So then it's like, well, now it's got the holes in it.

244
00:16:52,318 --> 00:16:53,443
Scott: You can't, like, give it to someone else.

245
00:16:53,463 --> 00:16:54,709
Scott: It's your ball, now it's for your hand.

246
00:16:54,991 --> 00:16:56,339
Rym: Granted, I just used alley balls.

247
00:16:56,379 --> 00:16:56,942
Rym: They were fine.

248
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:58,250
Rym: Not that I was a particularly good bowler.

249
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,255
Scott: Yeah, I used those too.

250
00:16:59,275 --> 00:17:00,259
Scott: I've never owned a bowling.

251
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,425
Scott: My parents owned bowling balls.

252
00:17:01,485 --> 00:17:01,767
Scott: I didn't.

253
00:17:01,807 --> 00:17:02,370
Scott: I never owned one.

254
00:17:04,332 --> 00:17:09,109
Scott: But I was thinking, right, oh, what if I went to that recycling center and I got the bowling balls?

255
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:11,497
Scott: They're basically gonna give it to me for free, right?

256
00:17:11,818 --> 00:17:15,910
Scott: The problem with recycling is that they can't sell the stuff to anyone, right, at a reasonable price.

257
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:22,626
Scott: But I could get the bowling balls, three bowling balls a day, and then I bet I could set up an installation at some museum or gallery.

258
00:17:22,646 --> 00:17:24,290
Scott: that's, like, a mountain of bowling balls.

259
00:17:24,851 --> 00:17:25,132
Scott: Right?

260
00:17:25,192 --> 00:17:29,100
Scott: And it would have so many meanings to it artistically, right?

261
00:17:29,121 --> 00:17:32,889
Scott: You know, it's like, you know, the story that I tell of the bowling ball, you know, the trash.

262
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:38,142
Scott: I'd be like, this is how many bowling balls are attempted to be recycled each year, right?

263
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:41,010
Scott: Look at how many there are, 1200 bowling balls and a pyramid, right?

264
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:41,932
Scott: Whoa, right?

265
00:17:42,313 --> 00:17:44,238
Scott: It would also be fucking cool, bowling ball pyramid.

266
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:48,610
Scott: All the different balls, all the different colors, you know, that were involved in it, right?

267
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:51,070
Scott: Maybe I could mix some pins in there, you know, who knows?

268
00:17:51,632 --> 00:17:55,930
Rym: I can imagine a lot of uses for it, a lot of bowling balls, many of which are illegal.

269
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:02,130
Scott: Yeah, it would be sort of like, you know, that Ai Weiwei one with all the bicycles and the big tower, but kind of like that, right?

270
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:04,855
Scott: So I was like, yeah, I should do that, and then I realized, wait a minute.

271
00:18:05,738 --> 00:18:11,110
Scott: Even if I get a gallery to agree to accept my installation, and even if I can construct the installation, right?

272
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:14,376
Rym: What, are you gonna bike over there on a city bike and pick up three bowling balls a day?

273
00:18:21,474 --> 00:18:23,249
Rym: So you set one in the front of the city bike.

274
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:28,041
Scott: Even if I get it, I imagine like, okay, I get a mini storage container, right?

275
00:18:28,101 --> 00:18:31,510
Scott: And I put three bowling balls in it, then I put six in, and eventually what?

276
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:34,710
Scott: They're so high that when I open the container, they fall on me and I die.

277
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:40,988
Rym: But Scott, that, that moment when they find your body is the true installation.

278
00:18:41,048 --> 00:18:41,690
Rym: That's the art.

279
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:49,970
Scott: It'd just be me at the mini store with the open door buried in bowling balls with my body bruised severely.

280
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:53,655
Rym: And the exhibit is called the individual responsibility.

281
00:18:54,316 --> 00:19:04,970
Rym: That is exactly, that the individual trying to take responsibility for these massive problems as opposed to systemic solutions will in fact just kill the individuals and not solve the problem.

282
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:14,050
Scott: Yeah, there was, I also saw a tweet today that showed a, like a mudslide in California or someplace, and it was a Prius was being washed away in the mudslide.

283
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,295
Scott: And it's like, it's like, yep.

284
00:19:16,696 --> 00:19:22,970
Scott: And you know, you buying the hybrid or electric car is not going to make up for to solve the climate change.

285
00:19:23,994 --> 00:19:26,489
Scott: You know, everyone having no car that will solve it.

286
00:19:27,151 --> 00:19:27,271
Rym: Yeah.

287
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:34,790
Rym: Even honestly, even just having slightly better mass transit in like the four biggest cities in America would have a measurable impact.

288
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:36,051
Scott: Yep.

289
00:19:36,394 --> 00:19:38,107
Scott: Anyway, so that was it.

290
00:19:38,891 --> 00:19:45,130
Scott: It was just an article about a small, fascinating article, but it, yeah, it has a, there's a lot to say.

291
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:47,161
Rym: I didn't know about those reactive balls at all.

292
00:19:47,241 --> 00:19:48,670
Rym: And that's, that's like, that's a whole topic.

293
00:19:49,592 --> 00:19:51,310
Scott: It spoke to me personally, this article.

294
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:51,611
Rym: Yeah.

295
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,090
Rym: Not that I ever particularly want to bowl again.

296
00:19:55,170 --> 00:20:06,590
Rym: I feel like most people who end up bowling in America in the year of our Lord 2021 are there because someone else thought a bowling party would be a good idea and everyone showed up because no one wanted to say, no, we don't like bowling.

297
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:07,460
Scott: Or in the bowling league.

298
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,370
Scott: There's bowling league people.

299
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,460
Rym: Yeah, but I don't feel like that is a growing hobby.

300
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,550
Scott: I'm not sure.

301
00:20:12,991 --> 00:20:14,119
Scott: It seems, hold, hold and steady.

302
00:20:14,462 --> 00:20:14,946
Scott: I would guess.

303
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:19,254
Rym: Ping pong was rising for a while, but it seems like it hit its plateau.

304
00:20:20,996 --> 00:20:32,250
Rym: Anyway, and some other news, this is kind of relevant to our main bit, but a doctor in Napa got in California was, it looks like the DOJ went after them.

305
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:36,677
Rym: Because they were faking vaccinations.

306
00:20:36,757 --> 00:20:43,110
Rym: Now this isn't like someone who just like prints out an image of the vaccine card and writes some bullshit on it to try to pretend they got vaccinated.

307
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:52,170
Rym: This was a doctor selling vaccination cards that they had filled out legitimately to make it officially look like this person had been vaccinated when they were not.

308
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,850
Scott: So obviously this person was caught and now they're not a doctor anymore.

309
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:55,291
Scott: Yep.

310
00:20:55,613 --> 00:20:58,066
Rym: This has happened a few times already, but.

311
00:20:59,112 --> 00:20:59,560
Scott: It's Dr.

312
00:20:59,641 --> 00:21:00,150
Scott: Nick out here.

313
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:09,470
Rym: The reason I want to link to this article is because you got, this is, this is why homeopathy and chiropractic and acupuncture and all that bullshit is so harmful to society.

314
00:21:09,931 --> 00:21:18,190
Rym: You can make a straight line from the deregulation of those industries in the nineties to the rise of fascism in America today.

315
00:21:19,171 --> 00:21:24,110
Rym: Not all the rise of fascism, but like bring an elevation of the rise, like an acceleration.

316
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:31,890
Rym: Because if you look at this story, which is typical of these kinds of story, you always wonder like, so what does this doctor, are they crazy?

317
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:34,770
Rym: Do they just think the vaccines are fake and they're trying to help people?

318
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:36,313
Rym: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

319
00:21:36,574 --> 00:21:41,650
Rym: I'm going to read the, uh, the money line, uh, the say the line part from this article.

320
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:51,449
Rym: Quote, "The doctor was also accused of selling her patients what she called immunization pellets that she said contained small amounts of COVID-19.

321
00:21:52,412 --> 00:21:55,628
Rym: She falsely claimed that those pills would give people immunity from the

322
00:21:55,668 --> 00:21:55,990
Rym: coronavirus.".

323
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:04,450
Rym: So whenever someone is doing this kind of crap, they're rarely doing it because they actually believe that the vaccines are dangerous.

324
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:12,070
Rym: Usually they are selling some sort of supplement or natural medicine scam and this is just part of their marketing.

325
00:22:12,271 --> 00:22:13,930
Rym: This is how they sell this bullshit.

326
00:22:16,372 --> 00:22:16,553
Scott: Yeah.

327
00:22:16,573 --> 00:22:20,339
Scott: I mean, also, you know, the surgeon general, what, like, uh, today, right?

328
00:22:20,379 --> 00:22:26,790
Scott: Did a whole speech about like, yes, misinformation is really, you know, like a severe problem, right?

329
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:29,555
Scott: He's like, he's like, the internet company should be blocking it.

330
00:22:29,575 --> 00:22:37,970
Scott: And he wasn't, you know, it's like the, if you read articles about this, you know, they mostly are focusing on the vaccine COVID misinformation, which is, uh, obviously a big problem.

331
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:39,090
Rym: But it's about everything.

332
00:22:39,851 --> 00:22:44,337
Scott: The surgeon general was talking about all, he said, it's an urgent threat, right?

333
00:22:44,918 --> 00:22:53,230
Scott: All, uh, you know, medical misinformation is an urgent threat to, you know, the safety of humanity, I guess.

334
00:22:53,530 --> 00:23:08,730
Rym: And if you'll take any major right-wing conservative media company in America and look at where they make their money, they've almost all of them eventually come to rest on the same industry, the fake supplements industry.

335
00:23:11,252 --> 00:23:16,899
Rym: Uh, in some other news, uh, that is also directly relevant to what we're going to have more news.

336
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:24,830
Rym: One more, uh, this is, this is pretty, this is also directly straight up relevant to our main bit, but, uh, it's not actually what we're going to talk about today.

337
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:35,790
Rym: Uh, so a U S consumer agency, and there's a whole bunch of other lawsuits around this, but there's a big one now, uh, the federal government, the consumer product safety commission is suing Amazon.

338
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:45,950
Rym: Uh, this is breaking news as of today, like a couple hours ago for, to force them to recall a huge number of hazardous products.

339
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:51,499
Rym: Amazon has so many products that they're not counterfeits.

340
00:23:51,719 --> 00:23:52,781
Rym: They're not bootlegs.

341
00:23:53,002 --> 00:23:57,210
Rym: This is not like a fake hairdryer that from like a full legs.

342
00:23:58,851 --> 00:24:03,638
Rym: These are just products with brands that you might not recognize because they're not real.

343
00:24:03,798 --> 00:24:05,180
Rym: Like it's a shell company.

344
00:24:05,501 --> 00:24:11,950
Rym: It's, there's probably the same product sold under a hundred different brands, but these are things like carbon monoxide detectors that just don't work.

345
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:17,998
Rym: Uh, hairdryers that will just kill you if they get wet, like they don't have any safety controls in them.

346
00:24:18,399 --> 00:24:25,090
Rym: Children's sleepwear that says, that says non-flammable, but that are in fact extremely inflammable.

347
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:26,031
Scott: Yeah.

348
00:24:26,051 --> 00:24:32,262
Scott: I mean, these are things that technically speaking, uh, customs is supposed to be watching this stuff when it comes in, right?

349
00:24:32,282 --> 00:24:36,390
Scott: Cause almost none of this stuff is manufactured in the U S very, very small amount of it.

350
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:39,495
Scott: So your customs is, is, is failed here, right?

351
00:24:39,515 --> 00:24:41,318
Scott: They should have turned this stuff away at the port.

352
00:24:41,879 --> 00:24:48,410
Rym: Um, but now Amazon should be doing some control and maybe not letting any wacko sell shit on Amazon.

353
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:49,711
Scott: Well, I think that's.

354
00:24:49,731 --> 00:24:56,040
Scott: the other problem is even if you go to a place and eat, you know, a store like a Walmart or a target or a best buy, they're not good stores.

355
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:03,210
Scott: They're just, they're evil also, but they won't have just, but every, everything they sell in those stores, there is a person whose job it is.

356
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:04,832
Scott: They're called a buyer, right?

357
00:25:04,852 --> 00:25:07,556
Scott: They buy, they buy wholesale goods.

358
00:25:07,596 --> 00:25:08,658
Scott: That's a job you can have.

359
00:25:08,698 --> 00:25:09,399
Scott: It's a fun job.

360
00:25:09,439 --> 00:25:10,881
Scott: I've always wanted it, but it's hard.

361
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:15,328
Scott: It's a powerful job also because you basically can choose who makes money and who doesn't.

362
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:16,730
Scott: It's a very powerful position.

363
00:25:17,171 --> 00:25:19,935
Scott: But, um, that person, right?

364
00:25:20,576 --> 00:25:23,119
Scott: If you work at say, if they're the buyer for target, right.

365
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:27,586
Scott: And they're buying children's clothes, they're not buying the inflammable clothes.

366
00:25:27,646 --> 00:25:30,250
Scott: And if they buy something that will be, that would be the end of them.

367
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:38,360
Rym: And if they buy something that says non-flammable and it turns out it is in fact inflammable, then they're going to see whoever they bought it from.

368
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:38,541
Scott: Right.

369
00:25:38,581 --> 00:25:39,382
Scott: Target will see.

370
00:25:39,402 --> 00:25:39,983
Scott: Exactly.

371
00:25:40,343 --> 00:25:40,503
Scott: Right.

372
00:25:40,603 --> 00:25:43,087
Scott: Amazon is like, Hey, where we have a website.

373
00:25:43,207 --> 00:25:45,670
Scott: Anyone who wants to sell anything, just sign up at our website.

374
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:48,315
Scott: Amazon may not ever even see the merchandise.

375
00:25:48,375 --> 00:25:54,807
Scott: It may go, you might just go to the Amazon website, buy something that sends a signal to someone else that someone else mails you something directly.

376
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:56,310
Scott: Amazon has not seen those goods.

377
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:57,111
Scott: Right.

378
00:25:57,331 --> 00:26:04,838
Scott: But yet they are now, uh, I guess, you know, what's the word for when you like, uh, aid in a crime, aiding and abetting.

379
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:05,919
Scott: Yeah.

380
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:08,422
Rym: Well here, actually I can, I can summarize it.

381
00:26:08,762 --> 00:26:14,547
Rym: The CPSC said that Amazon had to quote, accept responsibility for these dangerous goods.

382
00:26:15,508 --> 00:26:17,130
Rym: Uh, this is, this is some dangerous shit.

383
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:31,602
Rym: If you read the article, Amazon's response was it is unclear why they have filed a complaint seeking to force us to take actions almost entirely duplicative of those we've already taken, which is obvious.

384
00:26:31,622 --> 00:26:41,750
Rym: corporate bullshit speak because, uh, according to CPSC, Amazon's unilateral actions are insufficient to remediate the hazards posed by the products in question.

385
00:26:42,591 --> 00:26:47,499
Rym: I hope the USPC or the CSPC comes down on Amazon like a ton of bricks.

386
00:26:47,779 --> 00:26:54,630
Rym: This isn't just like Amazon should be broken up, but independently Amazon should be prosecuted for even selling these things in the first place.

387
00:26:54,750 --> 00:27:04,147
Scott: In my opinion, there's a lot of things that should be, there's a lot of things, a lot of these companies, almost every, almost every company period that is successful comes through.

388
00:27:04,187 --> 00:27:05,590
Rym: Amazon is complicit.

389
00:27:06,531 --> 00:27:06,811
Scott: Yes.

390
00:27:07,312 --> 00:27:10,698
Scott: Almost every successful company ever.

391
00:27:11,179 --> 00:27:11,420
Scott: Right.

392
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,241
Scott: Got it.

393
00:27:12,301 --> 00:27:16,209
Scott: Start with crimes and then basically gets it sorted out later.

394
00:27:16,249 --> 00:27:16,990
Scott: Crunchyroll started.

395
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:18,833
Rym: I was about to bring up crunchyroll.

396
00:27:18,853 --> 00:27:29,090
Scott: It's like, it's like, you know, almost every Uber, they just started out by ignoring every taxi law there was and there's blatant, just ignore all these laws and nobody arrested them for it.

397
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:31,756
Scott: And then they got enough money and then they became a thing.

398
00:27:32,136 --> 00:27:38,310
Scott: And now you can't like, I feel like you should still like, if I became in a position of power, I would just arrest the CEO of Uber.

399
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:42,680
Scott: Like you filed, you know, I'd be, if I was a prosecutor, I guess I'd have to be a federal prosecutor.

400
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,050
Scott: and I'd be like, Hey, here's all these taxi regulations you've been ignoring for the entire existence of your company.

401
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:49,496
Scott: We're going to take you to court over them.

402
00:27:49,536 --> 00:27:51,120
Scott: No, I don't know why nobody's done this yet.

403
00:27:51,782 --> 00:27:52,223
Scott: I love it.

404
00:27:52,263 --> 00:27:53,446
Scott: Regulations still exist.

405
00:27:53,647 --> 00:27:54,650
Scott: You're still ignoring them.

406
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:56,172
Rym: And we accept this stuff.

407
00:27:56,192 --> 00:28:03,523
Rym: If you go to the Wikipedia page about crunchyroll under history, the first heading is origins and illegal distribution.

408
00:28:04,204 --> 00:28:07,870
Rym: The second heading is move to legal distribution.

409
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:10,934
Scott: I mean, even small businesses, right?

410
00:28:10,994 --> 00:28:17,890
Scott: It's like, you know, a small business, there's so many laws and regulations and taxes and all sorts of stuff you have to do.

411
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:25,464
Scott: If you do everything by the book correctly, perfectly, and you're starting like, say a restaurant just out out of the gate, you do everything perfectly.

412
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:27,728
Scott: Doing everything perfectly costs you so much money.

413
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:28,289
Scott: You're just done.

414
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:28,970
Scott: Right.

415
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:32,416
Scott: If you want to start a restaurant, just so I can start slinging food.

416
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:33,058
Rym: Right.

417
00:28:33,458 --> 00:28:38,569
Scott: And then when the health inspector comes and gives you the F grade and tries to shut you down, then you fix your shit.

418
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:39,090
Scott: Right.

419
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:43,576
Scott: That's how you get a business actually off the ground, which is a problem, obviously.

420
00:28:44,617 --> 00:28:44,877
Scott: Right.

421
00:28:44,977 --> 00:28:45,458
Scott: Exactly.

422
00:28:45,538 --> 00:28:52,347
Scott: So and this is why, you know, people get credence when they start making arguments for deregulation.

423
00:28:52,367 --> 00:28:53,709
Scott: They're like, oh, we got to deregulate.

424
00:28:53,729 --> 00:28:54,870
Scott: So people can actually succeed.

425
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:58,515
Rym: Yeah, but no, if you have deregulation, that same thing will happen.

426
00:28:58,836 --> 00:29:03,422
Rym: But that second heading, the second heading move to legal, that'll never happen.

427
00:29:04,303 --> 00:29:04,704
Scott: Exactly.

428
00:29:04,924 --> 00:29:07,808
Scott: The restaurant will just keep operating with rat poop in the food forever.

429
00:29:08,229 --> 00:29:08,850
Scott: It's like you can't.

430
00:29:15,192 --> 00:29:17,874
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

431
00:29:17,994 --> 00:29:23,836
Rym: So following my theme, this video is called This Tent Could Kill You.

432
00:29:24,217 --> 00:29:25,297
Rym: Dangerous Cheap Tent.

433
00:29:25,837 --> 00:29:31,280
Rym: This is one of those things that like should not be allowed to be sold, but yet is sold because it's cheap.

434
00:29:31,881 --> 00:29:40,695
Rym: And because I'm getting into camping again and I had to buy a bunch of new camping stuff, these things are front of mind because I know about camping equipment.

435
00:29:40,775 --> 00:29:43,720
Rym: I understand like the risks, the dangers, what you need.

436
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,945
Scott: You watched a bunch of YouTube videos about it.

437
00:29:45,965 --> 00:29:47,309
Rym: Well, no, I also grew up camping a lot.

438
00:29:47,329 --> 00:29:50,337
Scott: The people who made those YouTube videos know about camping equipment.

439
00:29:50,377 --> 00:29:51,400
Scott: You just watch YouTube videos.

440
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:56,309
Rym: Well, I also learned this as a kid from like my Cub Scout, like den leaders and everything.

441
00:29:56,329 --> 00:29:56,489
Rym: And yeah.

442
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:57,812
Scott: OK, how much time?

443
00:29:58,072 --> 00:29:58,333
Scott: OK.

444
00:29:58,814 --> 00:30:00,577
Rym: Not I mean, some of those things haven't changed much.

445
00:30:00,597 --> 00:30:02,240
Rym: You know, it's changed since I was a kid.

446
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:09,250
Rym: And now, one, people tend to use bear canisters instead of hanging their food from a tree because the ladder doesn't actually really work that well.

447
00:30:10,371 --> 00:30:12,274
Rym: Two, tents are just better.

448
00:30:12,755 --> 00:30:14,918
Rym: Like they're so much better.

449
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,620
Rym: If you have an old tent, literally throw it away.

450
00:30:17,161 --> 00:30:18,444
Scott: That was the thing in old movies.

451
00:30:18,464 --> 00:30:20,327
Scott: You'd always see someone struggling to set up a tent.

452
00:30:20,367 --> 00:30:20,588
Scott: Yeah.

453
00:30:20,648 --> 00:30:23,494
Scott: And I never understood it because I never set up an old shitty tent.

454
00:30:23,514 --> 00:30:26,540
Scott: I only ever set up a pretty good tent in my life.

455
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,705
Rym: Water purification, so much better.

456
00:30:30,726 --> 00:30:33,953
Rym: When I was a kid, it was put you put iodine and bleach into the water, then drink it.

457
00:30:33,993 --> 00:30:34,775
Rym: It tasted like shit.

458
00:30:35,216 --> 00:30:36,600
Rym: It's so much better now.

459
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:49,680
Rym: But this video is a 10 minute long video that takes one of these cheap, no brand, like bullshit fake tents that I wouldn't blame an on expert for buying.

460
00:30:50,261 --> 00:30:50,842
Rym: Kind of like a bike.

461
00:30:50,862 --> 00:30:56,112
Rym: How are you supposed to know a Huffy is a piece of shit if no one told you and you don't know a lot about bikes?

462
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:57,896
Rym: You go you go to go to Amazon.

463
00:30:58,136 --> 00:31:00,080
Rym: You see that huffy and you think, oh, I need a bike.

464
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,141
Rym: The specs are good.

465
00:31:01,402 --> 00:31:02,263
Rym: They read this box.

466
00:31:02,523 --> 00:31:02,884
Rym: All right.

467
00:31:02,964 --> 00:31:03,645
Rym: This is a tent.

468
00:31:04,847 --> 00:31:05,608
Rym: It's waterproof.

469
00:31:05,968 --> 00:31:07,170
Rym: It says I can camp with it.

470
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:07,931
Rym: I'm going to buy it.

471
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:08,672
Rym: I'm going to camping.

472
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:13,880
Rym: And this tent is dangerous for like so many reasons.

473
00:31:14,521 --> 00:31:20,414
Rym: This tent is just like a death trap and it is terrifying that it is allowed to be sold by anyone.

474
00:31:20,434 --> 00:31:23,060
Scott: So what do you got?

475
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:23,580
Scott: All right.

476
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:31,151
Scott: So every I think it's every year, if I'm not mistaken, there is a person in New York City who is called the public advocate.

477
00:31:31,391 --> 00:31:31,651
Scott: Right.

478
00:31:31,671 --> 00:31:33,193
Scott: They're basically they're.

479
00:31:33,394 --> 00:31:33,594
Scott: it's.

480
00:31:33,614 --> 00:31:34,175
Scott: they're a weird.

481
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:37,980
Scott: it's a weird position to be in because basically you're not the vice mayor.

482
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,222
Scott: You're not the deputy mayor.

483
00:31:39,362 --> 00:31:41,045
Scott: But if the mayor goes down, you're next.

484
00:31:41,565 --> 00:31:46,433
Scott: And at the same time, you can submit, you know, bills to the city council to vote on.

485
00:31:46,653 --> 00:31:47,915
Scott: But you can't vote on shit.

486
00:31:48,055 --> 00:31:50,279
Scott: You can just be like, hey, you guys want to make a lot of this.

487
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:51,100
Scott: It's an idea I had.

488
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,321
Scott: You're also.

489
00:31:53,421 --> 00:31:56,847
Scott: generally I've the public advocate is like sort of the opposite of the mayor.

490
00:31:56,867 --> 00:31:58,309
Scott: Like everyone just loves the fuck out of them.

491
00:31:59,732 --> 00:32:04,480
Scott: Usually I've never seen people say bad things too much about any of the public advocates I've had.

492
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:16,294
Rym: I think part of it is that public advocate is a position like in New York City in particular, where progressive activists who tend to also vote in primaries and vote in elections regularly care a lot.

493
00:32:16,915 --> 00:32:21,060
Rym: And conservatives, but also uninvolved people don't think about it or even know it exists.

494
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:29,976
Scott: Anyway, so one of the things the public advocate does every once in a while, I think it's annually, is they release a list of the fucking worst landlords of the city, just like a ranking.

495
00:32:30,196 --> 00:32:30,437
Scott: Right.

496
00:32:30,597 --> 00:32:32,200
Scott: So it's sort of fun, but it's also true.

497
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:38,107
Scott: So this dude made this, I guess, his YouTube channel says Jeff seal.

498
00:32:38,367 --> 00:32:38,587
Scott: Right.

499
00:32:38,627 --> 00:32:39,989
Scott: So I assume that's the person's name.

500
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:42,593
Scott: They made a three part documentary.

501
00:32:42,633 --> 00:32:44,236
Scott: It's like a full on movie, basically.

502
00:32:44,276 --> 00:32:46,479
Scott: It's very Michael Moore, old school style.

503
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:46,960
Scott: Right.

504
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,181
Rym: I like that style.

505
00:32:48,201 --> 00:32:56,254
Scott: Not that old, not sort of the, not sort of what Michael Moore became over time, but more of his original kind of deal where he goes to find these landlords.

506
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:59,679
Scott: So in the movie, in the movie, you know, he's got, he's looking at the, he's going to the tenants.

507
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:00,380
Scott: Right.

508
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,282
Scott: And then he's trying to, you know, confront the landlords.

509
00:33:03,763 --> 00:33:04,023
Scott: Right.

510
00:33:04,143 --> 00:33:06,365
Scott: And then he sneaks into the landlord convention.

511
00:33:06,785 --> 00:33:07,026
Scott: Right.

512
00:33:07,086 --> 00:33:09,848
Rym: And so the landlord convention.

513
00:33:10,429 --> 00:33:23,620
Scott: So, um, yeah, if you want to get mad about how it's legal for someone to own proper, you know, own land period, uh, and, you know, charge people for shelter, which is necessary for life.

514
00:33:24,861 --> 00:33:29,148
Scott: Read about the term rent, then, and then to also do a bad job of it.

515
00:33:29,308 --> 00:33:29,548
Scott: Right.

516
00:33:31,391 --> 00:33:33,274
Scott: Um, you know, it's like, it's one thing to be a landlord.

517
00:33:33,334 --> 00:33:34,976
Scott: It's another thing to be a bad lid.

518
00:33:35,056 --> 00:33:35,337
Rym: Yup.

519
00:33:35,897 --> 00:33:37,680
Rym: Like slum lord on purpose.

520
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:38,881
Scott: Yup.

521
00:33:39,022 --> 00:33:43,153
Scott: So you can watch this, uh, pretty good documentary here and get, get mad.

522
00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:45,860
Rym: I'm uh, I'm already mad.

523
00:33:46,100 --> 00:34:04,617
Rym: The only reason I even I'm okay with my landlord is that I do prefer a corporate landlord as opposed to an individual person because I have found generally individual people who are doing it as an investment tend to be way more like weirdly aggressively shitty companies are a little more afraid of being sued if they're big enough or a little more.

524
00:34:04,717 --> 00:34:08,159
Scott: like after the show, I'll tell you something quick about my landlord.

525
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:19,871
Rym: So, uh, yeah, in the meta moment, still reading the, uh, tale of Genji, uh, Genji continues to sleepwalk through life and, uh, yeah, I would have made some different decisions from what.

526
00:34:19,931 --> 00:34:27,300
Scott: it's the first novel ever written by any human being in the history of literature period anywhere on earth.

527
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,184
Scott: The first novel, we still have it.

528
00:34:29,244 --> 00:34:30,868
Scott: We, you know, of what, what there is of it.

529
00:34:30,908 --> 00:34:31,690
Scott: We have all of it.

530
00:34:32,031 --> 00:34:32,672
Scott: You can read it.

531
00:34:32,712 --> 00:34:33,313
Scott: We're reading it.

532
00:34:33,373 --> 00:34:35,679
Scott: It's translated into our language so that we can read it.

533
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:41,348
Scott: Um, supposedly if you were a Japanese person reading it in Japanese, it would be sort of like reading Shakespeare.

534
00:34:41,368 --> 00:34:49,300
Scott: Like it's a really old style language, you know, so it'd be as hard as an English, you know, someone who speaks current English, like some teenager trying to read Shakespeare.

535
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,661
Scott: They're going like, what the hell are they saying?

536
00:34:52,143 --> 00:34:52,925
Scott: It's that kind of thing.

537
00:34:53,185 --> 00:34:54,746
Scott: Uh, but thankfully it's in English.

538
00:34:55,188 --> 00:35:01,416
Scott: Uh, and the English translation is actually easier to read than a Shakespeare depending on which one.

539
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,440
Scott: Um, so yeah, it's just long.

540
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:04,821
Scott: Yep.

541
00:35:05,081 --> 00:35:06,283
Rym: And we will be live.

542
00:35:06,303 --> 00:35:07,104
Scott: We're still going there.

543
00:35:07,244 --> 00:35:15,998
Rym: This weekend on Saturday at 1 45 PM Eastern time in the PAX 2 Twitch stream with an all new Atari game design panel that we recorded a while ago.

544
00:35:16,259 --> 00:35:17,000
Rym: We gave it to PAX.

545
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:22,267
Rym: Uh, if you like the overlay and like the aesthetic of the panel, let me know.

546
00:35:22,347 --> 00:35:23,348
Rym: Cause I made that myself.

547
00:35:23,428 --> 00:35:24,590
Rym: PAX didn't make that for me.

548
00:35:25,471 --> 00:35:26,813
Rym: Uh, I spent some time on that.

549
00:35:26,853 --> 00:35:27,735
Rym: I'm kind of proud of it.

550
00:35:28,556 --> 00:35:31,260
Rym: Uh, if you don't like it, speaking, tell Scott so he can make fun of me.

551
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:39,165
Scott: And, uh, speaking of packs online, you know, it's happening right now as we speak, if you're watching this live, you're not watching this live.

552
00:35:39,205 --> 00:35:41,347
Scott: Well, there's going to be VODs of PAX East online.

553
00:35:41,367 --> 00:35:42,748
Scott: So you're, you're, you didn't miss anything.

554
00:35:42,768 --> 00:35:44,609
Scott: Uh, but there is a few things.

555
00:35:44,669 --> 00:35:47,371
Scott: Number one, the keynote, which I didn't watch yet.

556
00:35:47,431 --> 00:35:47,851
Scott: I'm going to watch.

557
00:35:47,871 --> 00:35:50,773
Scott: the VOD was by the CEO of Jackbox.

558
00:35:50,873 --> 00:35:52,774
Scott: So I'm assuming that's a great keynote.

559
00:35:53,194 --> 00:35:55,176
Scott: I just based on that alone and I'm going to check it out.

560
00:35:56,096 --> 00:35:57,257
Scott: Uh, I might be wrong though.

561
00:35:57,277 --> 00:35:57,477
Scott: Who knows?

562
00:35:57,497 --> 00:36:01,440
Scott: Maybe the CEO of Jackbox is a boring person, but I guess that's possible, but it seems unlikely.

563
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:10,829
Scott: Tonight, Thursday the 15th at 8 PM Eastern time, uh, you may also have to watch a VOD of this too, because that's one hour from the time that I'm speaking.

564
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:18,717
Scott: Uh, is a panel in the PAX2 channel where they are going to rank the best bathrooms in video games.

565
00:36:19,237 --> 00:36:21,800
Scott: I'm going to watch, I'm going to watch that live in an hour.

566
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,901
Rym: That is so good.

567
00:36:22,962 --> 00:36:23,843
Rym: What a topic.

568
00:36:24,123 --> 00:36:25,305
Rym: A plus topic.

569
00:36:26,126 --> 00:36:30,391
Scott: Our panel is Saturday and then the Omegathon final is Sunday and also Saturday.

570
00:36:31,032 --> 00:36:34,437
Scott: Our panel's at 1 45, but it's 7 30 PM on Saturday.

571
00:36:34,898 --> 00:36:36,760
Scott: This is a super art fight at PAX East online.

572
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:44,085
Scott: Uh, I don't know if it's prerecorded or not, but, uh, if I got nothing to do on 7 30 Saturday, I'm going to be watching that also.

573
00:36:44,105 --> 00:36:44,806
Scott: I put it on my calendar.

574
00:36:44,966 --> 00:36:48,468
Rym: I would bet it's prerecorded based on other things I know, but not sure.

575
00:36:48,608 --> 00:36:51,591
Rym: There are, I think there's a few things that might be live live at PAX.

576
00:36:51,611 --> 00:36:52,571
Scott: Prerecorded or not.

577
00:36:52,651 --> 00:36:53,352
Scott: A super art fight.

578
00:36:53,372 --> 00:36:54,893
Rym: Yeah, a super art fight is always a good time.

579
00:36:55,733 --> 00:36:56,654
Scott: So, yeah.

580
00:36:57,355 --> 00:36:58,275
Rym: Anything you want to foist?

581
00:36:58,375 --> 00:36:59,516
Rym: I had nothing new today.

582
00:36:59,656 --> 00:37:00,817
Rym: No one took me up on Omegathon.

583
00:37:00,877 --> 00:37:01,938
Scott: Oh, we're still foisting?

584
00:37:01,958 --> 00:37:03,319
Rym: If you have something, will you just move on?

585
00:37:03,619 --> 00:37:04,200
Rym: The second dibs?

586
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:04,780
Scott: Yeah, let's move on.

587
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:05,620
Scott: I do.

588
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:06,241
Scott: I'll have things.

589
00:37:06,261 --> 00:37:07,522
Scott: We'll get a dibs next week.

590
00:37:07,582 --> 00:37:07,802
Rym: Yeah.

591
00:37:07,942 --> 00:37:09,603
Rym: We're, we're getting rid of a lot of baseline stuff.

592
00:37:09,643 --> 00:37:10,624
Rym: before we move on to things.

593
00:37:10,684 --> 00:37:15,107
Rym: I want to start, uh, I got to decide if we call it second dibs officially or call it the foisting.

594
00:37:15,947 --> 00:37:16,668
Scott: It's called second.

595
00:37:16,808 --> 00:37:17,709
Rym: I like foisting though.

596
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:18,709
Rym: Too bad.

597
00:37:18,809 --> 00:37:20,210
Rym: I like to foist things on people in general.

598
00:37:20,711 --> 00:37:21,571
Rym: So my go-to moves.

599
00:37:22,732 --> 00:37:23,853
Scott: Did anyone get your ogre?

600
00:37:23,913 --> 00:37:24,713
Scott: Does anyone want it?

601
00:37:24,893 --> 00:37:32,458
Rym: No, there are people who will want it and third dibs, but these are people who will only get it when it is a time where we will see them in person again.

602
00:37:32,518 --> 00:37:34,860
Scott: So like, but no, you have not had any second dibs required.

603
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,782
Rym: I have not had a second dibs request for the ogre big box.

604
00:37:38,563 --> 00:37:39,443
Scott: Well, that's a shame.

605
00:37:39,563 --> 00:37:39,764
Rym: Yep.

606
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:41,325
Rym: I do have a backup plan for it though.

607
00:37:43,246 --> 00:37:44,367
Rym: If you want it, like let me know.

608
00:37:44,427 --> 00:37:45,988
Rym: Otherwise someone else is getting it.

609
00:37:47,189 --> 00:37:47,529
Rym: Uh, yeah.

610
00:37:47,789 --> 00:37:49,871
Rym: So counterfeits and bootlegs.

611
00:37:50,591 --> 00:37:51,232
Rym: It's interesting.

612
00:37:51,252 --> 00:37:56,055
Rym: Now what I want to be clear about is what we're not talking about are scams.

613
00:37:56,916 --> 00:37:58,937
Rym: Like things that are just a straight up scam.

614
00:37:59,298 --> 00:38:02,440
Rym: Like on Amazon where you buy one kind of hard drive, they send you a different hard drive.

615
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:06,963
Scott: I think if we just say what a counterfeit and a bootleg is and just say anything that's not, that is not what we're talking about.

616
00:38:06,983 --> 00:38:07,083
Scott: Right?

617
00:38:07,103 --> 00:38:18,271
Scott: So a counterfeit or a bootleg is when you're at least in the, in the year 2020, we're not talking about, you know, uh, you know, gun and running whiskey up from who knows where that kind of bootleg, right?

618
00:38:18,291 --> 00:38:25,415
Scott: Uh, a counterfeit slash bootleg in the year 2021 is when you are selling, you know, a one good.

619
00:38:25,856 --> 00:38:26,136
Scott: Right.

620
00:38:26,556 --> 00:38:30,479
Scott: But actually you are not getting the good you think you're getting.

621
00:38:30,799 --> 00:38:31,079
Scott: Right.

622
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:32,160
Scott: You're getting the good.

623
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,863
Scott: Perhaps manufactured by someone else.

624
00:38:34,924 --> 00:38:35,104
Scott: Right?

625
00:38:35,124 --> 00:38:38,689
Scott: So for example, you tried to buy, I always remember this.

626
00:38:38,769 --> 00:38:45,778
Scott: I was in Israel in the, in the year 2000 and in the store there was a disc man, or was it some headphones?

627
00:38:45,798 --> 00:38:45,958
Scott: It was.

628
00:38:45,978 --> 00:38:47,260
Scott: maybe it was just man with headphones.

629
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:47,921
Scott: Doesn't matter.

630
00:38:47,941 --> 00:38:55,249
Scott: And it said on the package, literally pass anonic, it literally said, pass anonic, right?

631
00:38:55,689 --> 00:38:56,890
Scott: So that is a bootleg.

632
00:38:56,910 --> 00:39:05,760
Scott: They, they're, you, you know, you trick someone, they think they're buying Panasonic, but you know, if they're really foolish and they don't look closely, I guess they're getting pass anonic.

633
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:16,327
Scott: So today, this is a much more insidious problem with e-commerce because you are not there at the time of purchase to verify the goods before you hand over the money.

634
00:39:16,927 --> 00:39:22,251
Scott: So, and people are, have gotten wise and they don't sell a pass anonic.

635
00:39:22,571 --> 00:39:24,973
Scott: You look at it and it says fucking Panasonic on it.

636
00:39:25,033 --> 00:39:25,213
Scott: Right.

637
00:39:25,373 --> 00:39:32,958
Scott: It's like, uh, and, but act, you know, it's like you would need a really discerning eye to know that it's not what it says.

638
00:39:33,018 --> 00:39:35,660
Scott: it is, that it was not made by the Panasonic corporation.

639
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,902
Scott: That was made by someone else.

640
00:39:37,543 --> 00:39:41,007
Scott: And that it is usually going to be made at inferior quality, right?

641
00:39:41,328 --> 00:39:46,054
Scott: Usually at a lower price point, but not that low, just lower than the official goods.

642
00:39:46,695 --> 00:39:49,058
Scott: Um, sometimes at the same price as the official goods.

643
00:39:49,098 --> 00:39:50,239
Scott: Now you're fooled even more.

644
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:50,580
Scott: Right.

645
00:39:50,840 --> 00:40:07,720
Rym: And these are the kinds of things that honestly I'm angry about, about this than I am about all the other orthogonally adjacent things we could talk about because this not only could harm the person buying, but it can also harm the person making the real thing.

646
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:10,482
Scott: It also harms the person.

647
00:40:10,522 --> 00:40:10,703
Scott: Yeah.

648
00:40:10,743 --> 00:40:12,605
Scott: The person who makes the real thing is harmed.

649
00:40:12,866 --> 00:40:14,628
Scott: The person who buys the thing is harmed.

650
00:40:15,069 --> 00:40:15,329
Scott: Right.

651
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:18,954
Scott: And the people selling the thing are probably exploited and harmed.

652
00:40:19,035 --> 00:40:22,840
Rym: Also, it's really just a bad, I got a straight up counterfeit battery on Amazon.

653
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:28,705
Rym: Once it said Panasonic on it, I bought a Panasonic battery, looked like a Panasonic said it was a Panasonic.

654
00:40:29,145 --> 00:40:31,047
Rym: It, uh, failed on me almost immediately.

655
00:40:31,447 --> 00:40:32,828
Rym: And I tried to do like a return warrant.

656
00:40:32,848 --> 00:40:35,050
Rym: Like I did a service request warranty thing with Panasonic.

657
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:38,032
Rym: And they were like, that serial number is just fake.

658
00:40:38,873 --> 00:40:39,874
Rym: That's not our battery.

659
00:40:40,874 --> 00:40:41,095
Scott: Yep.

660
00:40:41,335 --> 00:40:41,795
Scott: Tough shit.

661
00:40:41,935 --> 00:40:43,296
Scott: Go complain to where you bought it.

662
00:40:43,416 --> 00:40:43,697
Scott: Yep.

663
00:40:44,097 --> 00:40:46,639
Rym: Play to Amazon because it's always Amazon.

664
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:47,880
Scott: It always is.

665
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:56,129
Scott: Well, partially it's because Amazon, I don't know what the status of this is now, but there was that inventory mixing where they mix all the inventory mixing.

666
00:40:56,189 --> 00:40:56,409
Scott: Right.

667
00:40:56,429 --> 00:41:06,260
Scott: So let's say, you know, if they still do this, I'm not aware, but the way it worked was like Amazon sells, I don't know, fucking Panasonic headphone.

668
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:06,520
Scott: Right.

669
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:11,003
Scott: And let's say you have a Panasonic headphone that's mint in box and you want to sell it.

670
00:41:11,483 --> 00:41:12,804
Scott: So you send it to Amazon.

671
00:41:12,824 --> 00:41:13,405
Scott: Right.

672
00:41:13,725 --> 00:41:17,788
Scott: And they, you know, don't separate the one you sent them from the legit ones.

673
00:41:17,888 --> 00:41:18,909
Scott: They just mix them all in.

674
00:41:19,349 --> 00:41:22,511
Scott: And if anyone buys one, they might've bought yours.

675
00:41:23,011 --> 00:41:23,232
Scott: Right.

676
00:41:23,332 --> 00:41:25,233
Scott: They might've bought one of the stock ones.

677
00:41:25,253 --> 00:41:35,300
Scott: You don't know, but it's like if they click on the Amazon website on your store, you get the money, but the inventory they actually get delivered to them could be the one you sent them.

678
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:38,244
Scott: It could be a different one because Amazon's like, well, they're all the same product.

679
00:41:38,284 --> 00:41:41,689
Scott: What does it matter if it's the one Scott sent us or the one that we ordered?

680
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:42,150
Scott: Right.

681
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:43,833
Scott: It's all the same thing, which is mix them all together.

682
00:41:44,213 --> 00:41:48,780
Scott: And what happened was people sent bootleg things to Amazon and they got mixed in with the real things.

683
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,120
Scott: Yeah.

684
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:55,966
Scott: So it didn't matter if you bought them from bootleg store on Amazon when you were looking at the seller and the list of sellers.

685
00:41:56,066 --> 00:41:56,246
Scott: Right.

686
00:41:56,266 --> 00:42:02,972
Scott: Which you can choose the seller or if you bought them from Amazon directly because the bootlegs got mixed in with the real shit.

687
00:42:03,692 --> 00:42:06,215
Scott: And so, you know, you'd only get.

688
00:42:06,275 --> 00:42:09,898
Scott: you only know you got a bootleg if you if you're the kind of person who can tell the difference.

689
00:42:10,618 --> 00:42:12,480
Scott: It's a big problem in the board game world now.

690
00:42:13,201 --> 00:42:21,538
Rym: Actually, I was going to use that as a news on our next Tuesday show because there's a big there's big movements in the counterfeit board game market lately.

691
00:42:21,578 --> 00:42:22,720
Rym: There's a bunch of news around that.

692
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:25,021
Scott: But yeah, board games.

693
00:42:25,061 --> 00:42:32,369
Scott: People just be like, you know, at the factory, it's like, OK, we know we're printing out these board games and we notice we're selling a lot of them.

694
00:42:32,389 --> 00:42:33,611
Scott: We're sending a bunch of these over.

695
00:42:33,711 --> 00:42:35,633
Scott: It's like, well, it's just a bunch of JPEGs.

696
00:42:35,673 --> 00:42:40,779
Scott: Let's just print them in this other printing facility, lower quality, cheaper and sell those.

697
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:41,360
Scott: Right.

698
00:42:41,801 --> 00:42:51,700
Rym: So we don't care about the intellectual property law or even just, you know, I have a factory that could make board games, download some scans of a game that's popular and just start selling the game.

699
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:57,310
Scott: Yeah, just like people go online and they don't know that much about the board game world.

700
00:42:57,330 --> 00:42:58,413
Scott: They're not super fans.

701
00:42:58,794 --> 00:42:59,756
Scott: They just type in this game.

702
00:42:59,796 --> 00:43:00,457
Scott: They want to buy.

703
00:43:00,718 --> 00:43:01,560
Scott: They see my listing.

704
00:43:01,921 --> 00:43:02,421
Scott: They click.

705
00:43:02,502 --> 00:43:04,525
Scott: They see the prices lower on this site.

706
00:43:04,585 --> 00:43:10,715
Scott: They click buy and they end up with a copy that had was not made by the person who actually made the game.

707
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:13,440
Scott: The person who actually made the game made no money on this transaction.

708
00:43:13,961 --> 00:43:18,293
Scott: The money went to this other person and the person who bought it got an inferior copy.

709
00:43:18,413 --> 00:43:20,960
Scott: That's not as good as the legit one.

710
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:28,789
Rym: I remember when I was in high school, I got a counterfeit 20 dollar bill, like just like I had a counterfeit 20.

711
00:43:28,789 --> 00:43:31,192
Rym: And I wasn't sure I was debating what to do with it.

712
00:43:31,713 --> 00:43:37,700
Rym: And from what I could tell, if I had reported it to the government, they would have taken it and I would have been out 20 bucks.

713
00:43:38,583 --> 00:43:39,793
Scott: The Secret Service handles that.

714
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:52,020
Rym: What I did, statute of limitations I'm assuming has long expired, is I just used it somewhere knowing it was a counterfeit because I didn't want to deal with it and I didn't trust that I would get my 20 dollars back otherwise.

715
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:54,405
Scott: I mean it's entirely possible.

716
00:43:54,846 --> 00:43:57,514
Scott: I guess I get most of my 20s from ATMs, but it's possible.

717
00:43:57,554 --> 00:43:59,700
Scott: I could have gotten one which is very unlikely to be counterfeit.

718
00:44:00,382 --> 00:44:00,983
Scott: It's possible.

719
00:44:01,024 --> 00:44:07,140
Scott: I could have gotten one as change somewhere that happened to be counterfeit and then used it because it's not like I'm fucking checking.

720
00:44:09,362 --> 00:44:13,100
Scott: But I've never knowingly had one that wasn't just like monopoly money.

721
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:23,035
Rym: In high school I had a knowing obvious counterfeit 20 dollar bill that I got somewhere in the course of getting cash from someone or transaction and I had to get rid of it.

722
00:44:23,937 --> 00:44:24,838
Rym: There's really no recourse.

723
00:44:24,858 --> 00:44:25,279
Rym: You're just SOL.

724
00:44:27,261 --> 00:44:27,401
Scott: Yup.

725
00:44:29,188 --> 00:44:31,918
Scott: Unless you know you can find the person who gave it to you and be like,

726
00:44:31,938 --> 00:44:31,998
Scott: "Hey!".

727
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,532
Rym: Yeah, they're like, "Oh, it's just in my

728
00:44:33,552 --> 00:44:34,057
Rym: wallet?".

729
00:44:34,098 --> 00:44:34,300
Rym: Great.

730
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,499
Scott: Yeah, well you report them, they're the ones who get busted, right?

731
00:44:38,521 --> 00:44:38,722
Rym: Yup.

732
00:44:38,742 --> 00:44:45,020
Rym: But it's interesting because there were some goods over the course of my life where I would maybe get a counterfeit on purpose.

733
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:50,799
Rym: Not now, but say I wanted a fancy Rolex style watch.

734
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:53,522
Scott: Fake Rolex.

735
00:44:53,622 --> 00:44:57,296
Rym: Just as good as a real Rolex if you're only trying to impress people who aren't going to look at it too closely.

736
00:44:57,316 --> 00:44:58,420
Rym: To be perfectly real.

737
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:05,540
Scott: Yeah, it's like I've gone on YouTube and I see these videos comparing real ones to fake ones and they're really close.

738
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:13,438
Scott: You can see the differences when they zoom in with their jeweler's loops and stuff and show you and you're like, "Oh yeah, I can see that the real one is superior in these

739
00:45:13,499 --> 00:45:13,739
Scott: ways.".

740
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:17,670
Scott: But it's like if you're just wearing it, you will never fucking know.

741
00:45:17,771 --> 00:45:20,840
Scott: And anyone else who doesn't bring out their jeweler's loop isn't going to fucking know either.

742
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:28,860
Scott: And the price of the real one is tens of thousands of dollars and the price of the fake one is hundreds or maybe ones of thousands of dollars.

743
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:39,839
Scott: And that's why I still won't buy the fake one because there's still too much money for just something that only tells time to pay more than I pay for an Apple Watch which not only tells time but does fucking ten billion other things.

744
00:45:40,059 --> 00:45:40,660
Scott: That's ridiculous.

745
00:45:42,263 --> 00:45:50,660
Scott: But it's like, yeah, obviously if you just want the thing that fucking tells time, it's like, sure, there is some legitimacy to the high price of the real Rolex.

746
00:45:50,800 --> 00:46:01,840
Scott: It's a handcrafted, possibly made of valuable gold, platinum, who knows, precise mechanical device and that is indeed worthy of a high price.

747
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:05,999
Scott: But I do believe the price is perhaps maybe too high.

748
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:17,800
Rym: But usually too, the kind of person who buys a counterfeit Rolex probably knows it's a counterfeit and is doing it on purpose because that seems like it would make sense.

749
00:46:18,441 --> 00:46:20,008
Rym: Like, oh yeah, here's a Rolex, 500 bucks.

750
00:46:20,429 --> 00:46:22,679
Rym: Nobody thinks that's a real Rolex when they buy it.

751
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:28,497
Scott: No, I mean, look how many people go down to Chinatown and they buy counterfeit handbag, right?

752
00:46:28,598 --> 00:46:29,240
Scott: And it's like, why?

753
00:46:30,061 --> 00:46:35,319
Rym: If you follow the guy who's just buttering Rolex, Rolex, Rolex under his breath, you know exactly what you're about to do.

754
00:46:36,361 --> 00:46:36,561
Scott: Right.

755
00:46:36,902 --> 00:46:45,020
Scott: And the thing is the counterfeit handbag is like people buy it because it's like you can't go to the real store and get a hand.

756
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:49,739
Scott: They want a handbag that looks like that, that is in that shape, possibly with that logo on it.

757
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:50,040
Scott: Right.

758
00:46:50,701 --> 00:46:53,347
Scott: And the real store only has one at real price.

759
00:46:53,708 --> 00:46:58,560
Scott: So you go to a shady place and the counterfeit handbag holds things just fine.

760
00:46:58,840 --> 00:46:59,603
Scott: There's nothing wrong.

761
00:46:59,664 --> 00:47:03,137
Scott: It's not like a counterfeit battery that explodes on you or doesn't work.

762
00:47:03,559 --> 00:47:03,780
Scott: Right.

763
00:47:04,281 --> 00:47:08,050
Scott: It's that the legitimate good is ridiculously overpriced.

764
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:12,640
Scott: You know, it's like, yes, they deserve some money for the design they've done.

765
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:13,483
Scott: Right.

766
00:47:13,844 --> 00:47:17,379
Scott: And the work they've put into marketing their, their trademark value.

767
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:17,640
Scott: Right.

768
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:19,527
Scott: It's like, there's a reason you want their brand.

769
00:47:19,567 --> 00:47:22,037
Scott: They did work to make their brand what desired.

770
00:47:22,058 --> 00:47:22,680
Scott: Right.

771
00:47:23,021 --> 00:47:24,788
Scott: And they deserve some compensation for that.

772
00:47:25,089 --> 00:47:26,435
Scott: But do you deserve $10,000 for a fucking bag?

773
00:47:26,455 --> 00:47:26,495
Scott: No.

774
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:29,004
Scott: There's no bag on earth.

775
00:47:29,425 --> 00:47:29,585
Scott: Right.

776
00:47:29,625 --> 00:47:34,438
Scott: That is just a bag that doesn't like, I don't know, clean your kitchen for you.

777
00:47:34,458 --> 00:47:34,659
Scott: Right.

778
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:36,024
Scott: That should cost $10,000.

779
00:47:36,024 --> 00:47:36,851
Scott: Now, it's just ridiculous.

780
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:39,283
Rym: I think we're a lot of like.

781
00:47:39,303 --> 00:47:41,167
Rym: the average GeekNights listener runs into.

782
00:47:41,207 --> 00:47:46,460
Rym: counterfeits is especially not as much lately, but before streaming was a thing.

783
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:49,588
Rym: Anime bootlegs were real common.

784
00:47:49,648 --> 00:47:50,511
Rym: Like there were fan subs.

785
00:47:50,712 --> 00:47:51,074
Rym: Sure.

786
00:47:51,174 --> 00:47:51,796
Rym: Separate bucket.

787
00:47:51,816 --> 00:47:52,780
Rym: Let's just bucket those aside.

788
00:47:53,262 --> 00:47:58,040
Rym: There were legitimate releases which were 20 to $40 per VHS tape, if you were lucky.

789
00:47:59,821 --> 00:48:06,450
Rym: And then there were the like bootlegs that were sold even sometimes in stores.

790
00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:13,980
Rym: that attempt like pretended to be a DVD or VHS box set of an anime, but were just fucking straight up counterfeits.

791
00:48:14,962 --> 00:48:18,229
Rym: And they were usually also very low quality.

792
00:48:18,449 --> 00:48:23,900
Rym: Well, we had that Planetest bootleg that the subtitles just Peter out after the first five or six episodes.

793
00:48:26,601 --> 00:48:26,802
Scott: Yeah.

794
00:48:26,902 --> 00:48:31,654
Scott: Sometimes the bootlegs were, you know, it's like, Hey, you could buy the legit thing.

795
00:48:31,935 --> 00:48:32,176
Scott: Right.

796
00:48:32,216 --> 00:48:33,299
Scott: Which is higher quality.

797
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:33,820
Scott: Right.

798
00:48:35,183 --> 00:48:37,327
Scott: And this is just trying to trick you out of your money.

799
00:48:37,407 --> 00:48:37,668
Scott: Right.

800
00:48:37,728 --> 00:48:42,738
Scott: It's like, you know, you could, it's like you could tell one booth at the anime con has a box set for $200.

801
00:48:42,738 --> 00:48:42,878
Scott: Right.

802
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:44,724
Scott: When that was still a thing.

803
00:48:45,167 --> 00:48:46,493
Scott: And the other one is a box set for $20.

804
00:48:46,493 --> 00:48:47,679
Scott: And it's like, Hmm.

805
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:59,300
Rym: I guess what always fascinated me about anime fans in particular in that era was that so many people would buy those bootlegs seemingly earnestly thinking they were legitimate and they just got a good deal.

806
00:49:00,002 --> 00:49:02,350
Rym: Like it was kind of a thing and it always bothered me.

807
00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:03,133
Scott: People don't know.

808
00:49:03,173 --> 00:49:05,360
Scott: That's why bootlegs continue because people don't know.

809
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:09,890
Rym: But then you look at these things and it's like, wow, that the cover on the DVD box is clearly.

810
00:49:10,892 --> 00:49:12,095
Scott: People don't look closely.

811
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:14,300
Rym: An 8 by 11 piece of like laser printed paper.

812
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,887
Scott: There, there are some people who know like us, right.

813
00:49:17,927 --> 00:49:19,751
Scott: Who are paying attention to detail.

814
00:49:19,851 --> 00:49:20,072
Scott: Right.

815
00:49:20,132 --> 00:49:23,700
Scott: And like, you know, researching and focusing and examining and whatnot.

816
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,306
Scott: And some people just aren't right.

817
00:49:25,346 --> 00:49:29,320
Scott: They just don't know that you like, you pointed out to them and they're like, whoa, I didn't notice that because they don't look closely.

818
00:49:29,901 --> 00:49:30,001
Scott: Right.

819
00:49:30,021 --> 00:49:31,223
Scott: They're not focused.

820
00:49:31,243 --> 00:49:40,260
Scott: They're just sort of, you know, coasting through, uh, you know, this process right without, you know, we're hyper examining every single thing we do.

821
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:41,723
Scott: I think it's more simple.

822
00:49:42,124 --> 00:49:48,480
Rym: Be if you're, you should be suspicious of something that seems like it's too good of a deal like that.

823
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:51,071
Scott: Some people aren't suspicious in life in general.

824
00:49:51,091 --> 00:49:53,220
Scott: We're suspicious of everything, even things that are legit.

825
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:54,101
Rym: Peace and point.

826
00:49:54,181 --> 00:50:01,640
Rym: If I'd like, if I, if an email that I get is even has like the slightest whiff of being a scam, it just gets deleted immediately.

827
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,165
Scott: Today they announced that handheld steam thing.

828
00:50:04,205 --> 00:50:05,348
Scott: And what's our first reaction.

829
00:50:05,428 --> 00:50:06,029
Scott: Is this real?

830
00:50:06,049 --> 00:50:07,292
Scott: That looks like it's fake.

831
00:50:07,333 --> 00:50:07,553
Scott: Right.

832
00:50:07,954 --> 00:50:09,097
Scott: First, first reaction.

833
00:50:09,117 --> 00:50:10,119
Scott: And then it's like, no, it's real.

834
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:10,500
Scott: Right.

835
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:11,442
Scott: It's like, it is real.

836
00:50:11,983 --> 00:50:16,192
Scott: Um, but our first instinct is always everything is fake.

837
00:50:16,253 --> 00:50:17,054
Scott: Everything is bullshit.

838
00:50:17,094 --> 00:50:17,555
Scott: That's a lie.

839
00:50:17,595 --> 00:50:18,698
Scott: That's, that can't be real.

840
00:50:18,778 --> 00:50:19,459
Scott: I'm checking this.

841
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:19,700
Scott: Right.

842
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:25,900
Scott: And not everyone has that that we have and that you can't always get it either if you don't have it already.

843
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:37,580
Rym: And that's why I definitely separate someone who seeks out counterfeit goods because they're cheaper from someone who unknowingly ends up with a counterfeit good, especially if they paid full retail price for that thing.

844
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:38,501
Rym: Like that battery.

845
00:50:38,522 --> 00:50:38,742
Scott: Yeah.

846
00:50:38,762 --> 00:50:42,308
Scott: It's like, yeah, it's like, it's like, and it's buying 70 bucks.

847
00:50:42,368 --> 00:50:44,973
Scott: I was pissed, but it's like the watch in the bag.

848
00:50:45,053 --> 00:50:46,355
Scott: It's like, that's okay.

849
00:50:46,576 --> 00:50:46,776
Scott: Right.

850
00:50:46,796 --> 00:50:48,820
Scott: There's like almost legitimate reason there.

851
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:48,980
Scott: Right.

852
00:50:49,120 --> 00:51:00,416
Scott: There's another, speaking of the DVDs, another legitimate reason, you know, getting something that's just not available where you are, which isn't an issue anymore with the internet, but it's like we, we would get, you know, bootleg attack the gas station.

853
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:03,261
Scott: Yeah.

854
00:51:03,521 --> 00:51:06,226
Rym: But I knew we went in eyes open.

855
00:51:06,246 --> 00:51:07,347
Rym: I am buying a bootleg.

856
00:51:07,387 --> 00:51:10,513
Rym: This is just piracy in a less digital way.

857
00:51:11,494 --> 00:51:11,735
Scott: Yeah.

858
00:51:12,075 --> 00:51:14,620
Scott: But they were, you know, there wasn't another option though.

859
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:14,920
Scott: Right.

860
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:18,866
Scott: It's like you're providing a certain bootleg service is the only service we can get.

861
00:51:18,926 --> 00:51:21,090
Scott: And in other place, parts of the world, right.

862
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:23,473
Scott: You know, it's like we're in the New York city, right?

863
00:51:23,754 --> 00:51:27,199
Scott: Legitimate goods of everything are, are basically available here.

864
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:27,700
Scott: Right.

865
00:51:28,241 --> 00:51:35,139
Scott: Pretty much if we have the money, right, we could go and get pretty much any legitimate good if we're willing to wait in a line at the, at the appropriate store.

866
00:51:35,339 --> 00:51:35,540
Scott: Right.

867
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:38,181
Scott: But it's like some people.

868
00:51:38,221 --> 00:51:44,468
Scott: you live in a place, most of the world, you know, even United States, some goods not available, right.

869
00:51:44,748 --> 00:51:46,971
Scott: The thing you want, you can't get it.

870
00:51:47,111 --> 00:51:48,212
Scott: It was a limited thing.

871
00:51:48,252 --> 00:51:55,920
Scott: It was a, you know, even, you know, it's like, yeah, you would need a ridiculous amount of money to get it where you are because no one ships it there.

872
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:56,360
Scott: Right.

873
00:51:56,380 --> 00:52:10,936
Scott: And it's like, and if someone's making a bootleg one that functions, right, then it, you know, I guess if it doesn't, it doesn't function at all, that's, that's not good for you, but it's like, yeah, bootleg one's the only one you're going to get.

874
00:52:11,056 --> 00:52:13,459
Scott: It's like, okay, that's why wouldn't you do that?

875
00:52:13,519 --> 00:52:13,739
Scott: Right.

876
00:52:13,819 --> 00:52:14,560
Scott: Rather to have nothing.

877
00:52:15,101 --> 00:52:15,661
Scott: Yup.

878
00:52:16,182 --> 00:52:20,088
Rym: Because it gets into sort of this broader, like there's another topic for a future.

879
00:52:20,128 --> 00:52:22,711
Rym: show around things that are not technically bootlegs.

880
00:52:22,932 --> 00:52:27,238
Rym: They're just knockoffs, but they're not violating any laws otherwise.

881
00:52:27,258 --> 00:52:28,740
Rym: They're just a knockoff of something.

882
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:29,580
Scott: Right.

883
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:34,006
Scott: So for example, you could, right, I've got here a Shure SM57 microphone, right?

884
00:52:34,026 --> 00:52:38,112
Scott: So let's say I live somewhere where I can't just order one online easily.

885
00:52:39,273 --> 00:52:40,294
Scott: And I want a microphone.

886
00:52:40,334 --> 00:52:44,019
Scott: Well, it's like there could be a microphone that looks a lot like this and says Shure SM57.

887
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:46,964
Scott: On it, but it wasn't made by the Shure corporation.

888
00:52:47,124 --> 00:52:47,685
Scott: Yeah.

889
00:52:47,705 --> 00:52:52,934
Scott: And how, you know, there might be another one that looks like this and functions like this, but doesn't say Shure on it.

890
00:52:52,954 --> 00:52:54,396
Scott: It just says like microphone on it.

891
00:52:54,696 --> 00:52:54,837
Scott: Right.

892
00:52:55,117 --> 00:52:56,920
Scott: They just maybe copied the design or something.

893
00:52:57,100 --> 00:53:00,145
Scott: And then there could just be like, I don't know, some other microphone.

894
00:53:00,245 --> 00:53:00,486
Scott: Right.

895
00:53:00,506 --> 00:53:02,249
Scott: So it's like, which one do you buy?

896
00:53:02,329 --> 00:53:03,892
Scott: The legit one isn't available.

897
00:53:04,152 --> 00:53:06,797
Scott: And the legit one, if it was available, would be the most expensive.

898
00:53:07,157 --> 00:53:08,580
Scott: If you don't need the legit one.

899
00:53:09,201 --> 00:53:09,501
Scott: Right.

900
00:53:09,581 --> 00:53:16,270
Scott: It's like, you know, I guess, you know, the one that says Shure on it has some questionable questionability to it.

901
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:16,550
Scott: Right.

902
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:19,033
Scott: Because they're sort of, you know, right.

903
00:53:19,093 --> 00:53:22,938
Scott: Taking advantage, you know, the Shure corporation could arguably be be harmed.

904
00:53:22,958 --> 00:53:24,300
Scott: They're definitely legally speaking.

905
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,503
Rym: That's the last point I want to touch on with brands.

906
00:53:27,643 --> 00:53:30,726
Scott: Morally, morally gray area.

907
00:53:30,886 --> 00:53:31,107
Scott: Right.

908
00:53:31,367 --> 00:53:35,592
Scott: But the other two, it's like, what's the moral gray area in the other two?

909
00:53:35,672 --> 00:53:40,717
Scott: It's like, you know, you know, hopefully that you're just you just need a microphone.

910
00:53:40,918 --> 00:53:41,098
Scott: Right.

911
00:53:41,138 --> 00:53:41,859
Scott: Does this one work?

912
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:42,540
Scott: It's like, OK.

913
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:45,384
Rym: Ooh, the listener actually had a really good.

914
00:53:46,647 --> 00:53:47,769
Rym: They framed this pretty well.

915
00:53:47,789 --> 00:53:49,131
Rym: I actually want to read what they typed here.

916
00:53:50,433 --> 00:53:50,954
Rym: Blah, blah, blah.

917
00:53:51,034 --> 00:53:54,120
Rym: If a movie isn't available anywhere, a pirate becomes a curator.

918
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:55,645
Scott: Yeah, sure.

919
00:53:55,807 --> 00:53:56,253
Scott: Exactly.

920
00:53:56,273 --> 00:53:56,860
Scott: Yeah.

921
00:53:57,961 --> 00:54:08,380
Rym: But I guess the what this comes down to is that especially with all the other types of scams we're not talking about today and knockoffs and everything, there was a time where brands were almost overrated.

922
00:54:09,161 --> 00:54:17,111
Rym: And then we got to this period where brands are kind of very important now because a brand implies that there is accountability.

923
00:54:17,411 --> 00:54:24,380
Rym: There's someone you the government or you can go after if a product harms you in some way or is inadequate in some way.

924
00:54:26,201 --> 00:54:32,551
Rym: Or if there isn't, like if the brand sucks, at least you can know where that thing came from.

925
00:54:32,932 --> 00:54:37,760
Rym: Like knowing this is a real sure microphone versus a knockoff that looks like a sure microphone.

926
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:45,640
Rym: That's real important in a society where if I type microphone in Amazon, there's a million things that look like they're complete pieces of shit and no one would know otherwise.

927
00:54:46,361 --> 00:54:47,103
Rym: I'm a professional.

928
00:54:47,404 --> 00:54:52,100
Rym: I would choose to buy the brand that I trust because of that accountability and my trust in that brand.

929
00:54:53,061 --> 00:54:53,261
Scott: Sure.

930
00:54:53,381 --> 00:55:00,895
Scott: I mean, but not accounting for the fact that, you know, someone might put a brand on something.

931
00:55:01,015 --> 00:55:01,957
Scott: that's bootleg, right?

932
00:55:01,977 --> 00:55:03,600
Scott: It's not actually the brand it says it is.

933
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:08,665
Scott: That's why I say, but forgetting that right back in the day, right?

934
00:55:08,685 --> 00:55:23,040
Scott: In the olden days, probably even within our lives, like maybe the 80s or earlier when something had a brand on it, you knew like it was like almost 100% guaranteed that the that company that with that brand label made that thing.

935
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:25,842
Scott: Nowadays, right?

936
00:55:25,902 --> 00:55:30,007
Scott: There is legitimate rebranding run rampant, right?

937
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:33,832
Scott: You buy something and it says a legitimate brand name on it.

938
00:55:34,073 --> 00:55:38,398
Scott: It's sold in the store, the legitimate retail store of that brand.

939
00:55:38,679 --> 00:55:39,560
Scott: It is not a bootleg.

940
00:55:40,141 --> 00:55:41,985
Scott: But that company did not make that thing.

941
00:55:42,546 --> 00:55:48,260
Scott: They bought that thing from some other no name place and they slapped their brand on it.

942
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,588
Scott: Now, ideally, it's like a white label product line.

943
00:55:51,628 --> 00:55:56,680
Rym: Now, ideally, if those are low tier goods, then they're degrading the quality of that brand over time.

944
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:58,682
Scott: Sure, possibly.

945
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:09,680
Scott: But it doesn't, it still is like, you know, the brand there is like, yeah, it's the real brand on the, on a product that they're really, that brand is really selling, but they didn't make it.

946
00:56:10,122 --> 00:56:13,000
Scott: So you're not really, it's not really that brand's product.

947
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:20,719
Rym: They're officially, with a paper trail, vouching for it in some way, which is a step above buying the Sorny.

948
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:22,841
Scott: Possibly, yes.

949
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:27,248
Scott: But it's still, it's still not a phenomenon that has always been around.

950
00:56:27,288 --> 00:56:33,378
Scott: I feel like, you know, if you go back, there was a time, you know, in last entry where that rebranding wasn't as big of a thing.

951
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:39,818
Rym: Or look at cereal where there'd be the generic cereal that is literally the same cereal just without the brand name on it.

952
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:47,480
Rym: Like that was the era where I would seek out non-branded things because they were the same as the branded things, just cheaper.

953
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:55,520
Rym: Now I'm almost at the point where not only do I seek out brands that I know and to a degree trust that to a degree, because it's capitalism, you can't really trust anyone.

954
00:56:56,121 --> 00:57:11,640
Rym: But also I honestly, unless something is like bottom tier or like local goods or groceries, like really simple stuff, I buy almost everything if I can direct from the manufacturer or direct from the brand via their e-commerce platform.

955
00:57:12,021 --> 00:57:16,700
Rym: And I really try to avoid buying things from marketplaces of any kind, including Amazon.

956
00:57:18,201 --> 00:57:24,840
Rym: Like when I buy Shure stuff, I buy direct from Shure or I buy it from a company like Sweetwater that like specializes in audio here.

957
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:39,060
Scott: There are certain specialized retailers out there that have like these, you know, online that have very close, like industry retailers for certain kinds of goods and have very close relationships with the actual manufacturers.

958
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:44,600
Rym: Like Sweetwater's example, not to like plug them, but that is where I buy audio equipment from.

959
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:45,261
Scott: Yeah.

960
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:47,747
Scott: So for example, like in the camera world, right?

961
00:57:47,907 --> 00:57:50,172
Scott: You have B&H where you shouldn't buy anything from, right?

962
00:57:50,193 --> 00:57:53,380
Scott: I don't, I don't support them, but then there's like Adorama is another one.

963
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:57,385
Scott: What's another one is the camera store in Chicago.

964
00:57:57,425 --> 00:57:58,487
Scott: I think that's where they are.

965
00:57:58,607 --> 00:58:07,660
Scott: I know, but there's a few of these like online camera stores that have very close relationships with Sony, Canon, Nikon, right?

966
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:10,166
Scott: Panasonic, Fuji, everyone.

967
00:58:10,226 --> 00:58:10,426
Scott: Right.

968
00:58:10,827 --> 00:58:14,476
Scott: And like those places are only selling legitimate goods.

969
00:58:14,516 --> 00:58:16,360
Scott: They're legit retailers of the thing.

970
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:27,040
Scott: And sometimes those, those like they'll have their own website, of course, with their own e-commerce, but sometimes you go on Amazon and you'll see that you're actually buying from one of those stores.

971
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:27,601
Scott: Yup.

972
00:58:27,642 --> 00:58:27,882
Scott: Right.

973
00:58:28,163 --> 00:58:29,747
Scott: And that's actually a safe purchase.

974
00:58:29,787 --> 00:58:30,930
Rym: Well, well to a degree.

975
00:58:30,950 --> 00:58:32,896
Scott: You're just giving Bezos money for no reason.

976
00:58:32,956 --> 00:58:34,500
Scott: Why don't you just go through to the real store?

977
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:35,482
Scott: But also depending.

978
00:58:35,523 --> 00:58:37,428
Scott: You are going to be getting legitimate goods if you do.

979
00:58:37,448 --> 00:58:41,300
Rym: Depending on how much co-mingling of inventory still happens, that might not guarantee your safety.

980
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:45,751
Scott: No, if you see one of those stores as like the seller, you're actually going to get it shipped.

981
00:58:45,812 --> 00:58:46,955
Scott: It'll ship from that store.

982
00:58:47,055 --> 00:58:49,000
Rym: I don't know if that's true in all cases, to be honest.

983
00:58:51,561 --> 00:58:58,538
Scott: Every time I've done it, I've gotten a package that was clearly from the store, like with their tape on it, not even Amazon's tape on it.

984
00:59:00,702 --> 00:59:05,360
Rym: So that battery had the Panasonic tape on it, which was extra funny, like on the little box.

985
00:59:07,401 --> 00:59:08,442
Scott: But yeah, that's the thing.

986
00:59:08,482 --> 00:59:14,470
Scott: So there are retailers that are like industry retailers that can be trusted to always carry industry goods.

987
00:59:14,510 --> 00:59:22,700
Scott: Like Newegg, for example, as long as you always buy first party from Newegg and not from some other sellers listing things on Newegg, you're going to be getting legit goods.

988
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:28,009
Scott: Newegg doesn't have, you know, exGA video cards.

989
00:59:28,049 --> 00:59:30,574
Scott: They only have EVGA, right?

990
00:59:30,695 --> 00:59:32,478
Scott: But there could be a third party seller on Newegg.

991
00:59:32,498 --> 00:59:33,360
Scott: You got to go watch out for that.

992
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:52,040
Rym: But honestly, the best way to go, if you can, is to always buy direct and direct to consumer brands are actually growing in not just like entirely direct to consumer brands are growing, but also brands that previously would make a lot of relationships with retailers and would not sell directly because they were afraid of poisoning that.

993
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:52,320
Rym: well.

994
00:59:52,941 --> 00:59:58,169
Rym: They've started to sell direct partly to avoid all these problems we talked about because we live in a capitalist hellscape.

995
00:59:58,609 --> 01:00:01,273
Rym: And partly, why even have that middleman there?

996
01:00:01,333 --> 01:00:05,740
Rym: It's not that expensive to run an e-commerce platform if you're even like a middling sized company.

997
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:06,720
Scott: Yeah.

998
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:12,105
Scott: It's like I'm seeing, you know, like I look around the city, like I was just in Manhattan to go to the dentist and I biked around.

999
01:00:13,046 --> 01:00:17,870
Scott: And it's like, yeah, you know, the stores for like sneakers are still huge, right?

1000
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:20,872
Scott: So, you know, Foot Locker, those kind of places still in business.

1001
01:00:21,252 --> 01:00:25,276
Scott: But the lines for the shoes are at the Nike store.

1002
01:00:25,436 --> 01:00:27,838
Scott: There was no there's no line for shoes at a Foot Locker, right?

1003
01:00:28,138 --> 01:00:30,280
Scott: They don't have that limited edition thing there.

1004
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:30,560
Scott: Right.

1005
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:32,622
Scott: But now it's like a Nike store.

1006
01:00:32,882 --> 01:00:36,184
Scott: That's like just that didn't exist when I was a kid.

1007
01:00:36,405 --> 01:00:36,625
Scott: Right.

1008
01:00:36,705 --> 01:00:39,847
Scott: It was either Foot Locker or Foot Action USA.

1009
01:00:40,287 --> 01:00:41,208
Scott: There was a sneaker store.

1010
01:00:41,248 --> 01:00:43,450
Scott: There was not this sort of direct like.

1011
01:00:43,490 --> 01:00:46,132
Scott: there was no Reebok store or a mall.

1012
01:00:46,612 --> 01:00:46,872
Scott: Right.

1013
01:00:46,892 --> 01:00:48,814
Scott: That was that.

1014
01:00:49,034 --> 01:00:50,515
Scott: now that's a thing everywhere.

1015
01:00:50,555 --> 01:00:54,138
Scott: The brand just has its own fucking store, even brick and mortar for getting the Internet.

1016
01:00:54,158 --> 01:00:57,280
Scott: They just have their own goddamn store selling their own goods.

1017
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:57,680
Scott: Yeah.

1018
01:00:57,740 --> 01:00:59,101
Scott: You know, you're getting the real thing there.

1019
01:00:59,161 --> 01:01:02,003
Scott: And people are going to those stores more than going to.

1020
01:01:02,043 --> 01:01:06,186
Rym: And I think that is caused by these two things we just mentioned.

1021
01:01:06,466 --> 01:01:10,649
Rym: One, cut out a middleman who's just rent seeking, you know, talking about landlords earlier.

1022
01:01:11,170 --> 01:01:18,095
Rym: And two, trying to get out of the hellscape of bootleg like the bootleg ecosystem that's growing and growing and growing right now.

1023
01:01:18,475 --> 01:01:19,716
Scott: Great example, Apple store.

1024
01:01:19,856 --> 01:01:20,096
Scott: Right.

1025
01:01:20,116 --> 01:01:22,058
Scott: They're just like, fuck this cop USA bullshit.

1026
01:01:22,098 --> 01:01:22,998
Scott: Just like an Apple store.

1027
01:01:23,118 --> 01:01:23,419
Scott: Done.

1028
01:01:23,699 --> 01:01:23,999
Rym: Right.

1029
01:01:24,019 --> 01:01:24,199
Rym: Yep.

1030
01:01:24,399 --> 01:01:25,500
Rym: Microsoft has the Microsoft.

1031
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:28,342
Scott: Whatever I buy, whenever I buy an Apple thing, I just buy it.

1032
01:01:28,602 --> 01:01:29,103
Scott: There's an app.

1033
01:01:29,123 --> 01:01:32,485
Scott: There's an app you can get for your any Apple device.

1034
01:01:32,725 --> 01:01:35,907
Scott: There's an Apple store app that like does fancy stuff.

1035
01:01:35,967 --> 01:01:38,669
Scott: If you walk into an Apple store, like let you buy stuff and just walk out.

1036
01:01:38,929 --> 01:01:44,994
Scott: But you can just at home open up the Apple store app and buy any Apple product and then it will show up at your house.

1037
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:45,214
Rym: Yep.

1038
01:01:45,514 --> 01:01:47,596
Rym: My laptop, my my laptop, the surface.

1039
01:01:47,656 --> 01:01:49,537
Rym: I bought it directly from Microsoft.

1040
01:01:50,478 --> 01:01:51,418
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

1041
01:01:51,578 --> 01:01:53,900
Scott: So that's how that's how I do.

1042
01:01:56,271 --> 01:01:58,517
