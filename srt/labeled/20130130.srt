00:01:46,854 --> 00:01:48,440
Rym: I don't remember we didn't do one on Monday.

37
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,311
Scott: This is what probably.

38
00:01:49,351 --> 00:01:49,858
Rym: how can you?

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,380
Scott: So you want to talk about something else that happened over the New Year's break?

40
00:01:55,403 --> 00:01:59,136
Rym: We had like a hundred awesome things that happen that we didn't talk about.

41
00:01:59,156 --> 00:02:00,240
Scott: All right, so you remember one of them?

42
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,143
Rym: Nope, not one.

43
00:02:01,544 --> 00:02:07,699
Rym: Oh, I went skiing a whole shit ton of times and I had some awesome ski times But I remember what they did.

44
00:02:08,021 --> 00:02:21,151
Rym: In fact, I went to Hunter Mountain this previous weekend which is actually after at the show where we said there's a bunch of stuff and It had snowed a whole bunch and there were like snow Valleys on trails that are normally flat.

45
00:02:21,351 --> 00:02:22,175
Rym: It was awesome.

46
00:02:22,195 --> 00:02:23,922
Scott: I Got one.

47
00:02:24,162 --> 00:02:24,624
Scott: You got one.

48
00:02:24,684 --> 00:02:25,226
Scott: I got one.

49
00:02:25,286 --> 00:02:29,320
Scott: got one when we were getting on the bolt bus to go to magfest.

50
00:02:29,481 --> 00:02:32,150
Rym: Oh, right the crazy yelling star was a crazy.

51
00:02:32,171 --> 00:02:34,720
Scott: You're basically I don't know what happened.

52
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:40,040
Scott: I think it was just a situation of narrow bus aisle guy was trying to push past a guy, right?

53
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:40,798
Rym: Well, we are.

54
00:02:41,422 --> 00:02:47,841
Rym: There was a prelude to this because apparently outside the bus the same guy had an altercation with an unrelated person for an unrelated reason Really?

55
00:02:47,861 --> 00:02:52,196
Rym: I didn't know that with this guy as far as I can get my guess my gut feeling.

56
00:02:52,216 --> 00:02:53,220
Scott: He's just an angry guy.

57
00:02:53,500 --> 00:03:07,347
Rym: he's one of those guys who is both angry has poor impulse control is Prone to feeling like other people disrespect him and feels like he needs to assert his manliness and get respect From people around.

58
00:03:07,428 --> 00:03:09,500
Scott: or maybe he's just a nut with a problem.

59
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:14,056
Scott: Anyway, so apparently this guy, you know, we're just sitting on the bus waiting to take off.

60
00:03:14,096 --> 00:03:15,100
Scott: people are loading their shit on.

61
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,980
Rym: We're doing our thing like me and Scott and chase was talking about, you know, we're having the same conversation.

62
00:03:21,064 --> 00:03:27,125
Scott: Everyone in the bus hears this guy saying like oh you lucky, you know I'll fuck you up.

63
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,170
Scott: Fuck you up kick your ass.

64
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,356
Rym: I'll fuck anyone else.

65
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:30,019
Rym: I'm looking at me.

66
00:03:30,301 --> 00:03:32,830
Scott: Yeah, he's basically like really threatening this dude.

67
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,395
Scott: Like, you know, you're lucky whatever.

68
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:35,600
Scott: I didn't beat the shit out of you.

69
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,585
Rym: I'm pretty sure.

70
00:03:36,646 --> 00:03:47,672
Scott: what happened in this case was the dude was Standing there and slightly bumped into him a little bit on a bus or maybe walked past him because he was in the aisle And he needed to get to a seat or who knows what.

71
00:03:47,692 --> 00:03:49,000
Rym: it's one of those kinds of guys.

72
00:03:49,261 --> 00:03:53,620
Rym: So the guy's causing all this just being really like yeah, and the whole bus just sitting there looking at him.

73
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,613
Rym: I got my camera out videoing.

74
00:03:55,633 --> 00:03:57,647
Rym: cuz I'm waiting for you to YouTube.

75
00:03:57,667 --> 00:04:01,510
Rym: good heaven Stop looking at me.

76
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:02,459
Rym: I'll fuck anyone up.

77
00:04:03,986 --> 00:04:07,060
Rym: So then bunch of people go out and they're like, yeah, this guy's causing trouble.

78
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:12,080
Scott: So I so I go to fill and I'm like if that guy starts anything We're all jumping up at the same time, right?

79
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:23,400
Rym: Let me and chase and fill are all like just count to three and everyone's like yes The bus driver comes back on the bus pretty much right away and he's like their problem.

80
00:04:24,282 --> 00:04:34,253
Rym: Because if there's a problem on this bus I will stop it and I will call the police and they will take to whoever is causing the problem Random ass jail in the middle of nowhere.

81
00:04:34,293 --> 00:04:35,660
Rym: He's like, I don't care where we are on the freeway.

82
00:04:35,861 --> 00:04:39,495
Rym: We will stop this bus and the police will come and they will deal with it.

83
00:04:39,535 --> 00:04:40,720
Rym: So is there a problem?

84
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,154
Rym: Does anyone have a problem?

85
00:04:42,194 --> 00:04:42,336
Rym: so?

86
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,241
Rym: Problem.

87
00:04:43,261 --> 00:04:48,100
Scott: they reconfirm that no one had a problem like a bunch of times and that shut the guy up real fast.

88
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,989
Scott: Cuz he must have really wanted to go to DC.

89
00:04:50,049 --> 00:04:50,772
Rym: now one point.

90
00:04:50,792 --> 00:04:55,552
Rym: that guy was like I wasn't causing any problem and the bus driver plays.

91
00:04:55,572 --> 00:04:56,274
Rym: It's so cool.

92
00:04:56,314 --> 00:04:57,760
Rym: The bus driver knew who the problem was.

93
00:04:58,843 --> 00:04:59,647
Rym: The bus drivers like.

94
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,020
Rym: I ain't talking to anyone specific.

95
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:13,280
Rym: I don't know why you think I'm talking to you many pauses and he's like I'm just saying if there's trouble do would anyone like to tell me if there is trouble on the bus?

96
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,627
Rym: He gave us all a chance.

97
00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:20,332
Rym: if any one of us have been like that guy I think he would have been arrested or at least kicked off the bus maybe.

98
00:05:20,813 --> 00:05:26,620
Rym: and then someone else who was outside later was like Yeah, the guy like got to a fight with someone else because he say cut in front of him in line, whatever.

99
00:05:27,181 --> 00:05:32,209
Scott: But the in the end all that happened was you know The threat of being arrested in the middle of the fuck.

100
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:41,700
Scott: know where wherever the bus that guy was silent the whole Troopers was I guess enough to get that guy to shut up and go to DC quietly and then on the bus ride back.

101
00:05:41,762 --> 00:05:42,197
Scott: It was normal.

102
00:05:42,702 --> 00:05:57,215
Rym: I didn't get to ride on the bus ride back because I was waiting to fly to Istanbul like five hours after the bus I'd paid for was gonna leave and then actually it was even better than normal because instead of having to pay Oh, that's another story, right?

103
00:05:57,276 --> 00:05:58,804
Scott: Oh It's coming back now.

104
00:05:59,045 --> 00:06:02,559
Scott: Yeah, so we go outside the train station once we get to.

105
00:06:03,121 --> 00:06:04,766
Rym: Oh, I wasn't in for this.

106
00:06:04,786 --> 00:06:06,733
Rym: No, no on the way on the way in.

107
00:06:06,974 --> 00:06:08,780
Scott: Oh the black cab the black cab.

108
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:13,440
Scott: So this guy, you know, there's the real cabs and there's the limo service that wants to charge you a fortune, right?

109
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,264
Rym: It's like no man.

110
00:06:14,304 --> 00:06:14,787
Rym: Come with me.

111
00:06:14,888 --> 00:06:15,411
Rym: I'm a cab.

112
00:06:15,451 --> 00:06:16,517
Rym: I'll take you where you're going 70 bucks.

113
00:06:17,181 --> 00:06:19,931
Scott: Yeah, like no that guy's gonna charge me like 30.

114
00:06:19,931 --> 00:06:22,380
Scott: I'm not paying your 70 you charge me 30.

115
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,546
Scott: I'll get in your car.

116
00:06:23,626 --> 00:06:29,852
Rym: No, usually if you're a New Yorker or you're from a New York, we know the score and the guy got him.

117
00:06:30,013 --> 00:06:31,037
Rym: He starts arguing with us.

118
00:06:31,097 --> 00:06:31,960
Rym: Like what are you saying?

119
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,024
Rym: I'm not a real cabbie.

120
00:06:33,365 --> 00:06:37,720
Rym: Look at this guy starts looking at like the guy whose job it is to get real cabs for people.

121
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,775
Rym: He's like these guys said I'm not a real cabbie.

122
00:06:39,795 --> 00:06:40,460
Rym: What do you think of that?

123
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:46,356
Rym: And that guy just kind of looks at him like hey, please stop talking to me And the guy gets super mad though.

124
00:06:46,376 --> 00:06:51,136
Rym: I think No, I've never met anyone outside of New York who calls them black cabs.

125
00:06:51,276 --> 00:06:52,080
Scott: Why would you call it?

126
00:06:52,581 --> 00:06:55,274
Rym: I just call it fake cabs fake.

127
00:06:55,354 --> 00:06:56,520
Rym: I call it a fake cab.

128
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:03,415
Scott: I called the black cab because it's always black or I call it What was the color of his SUV or a shady cab a car service?

129
00:07:03,515 --> 00:07:04,780
Rym: I will call it that sometimes.

130
00:07:05,562 --> 00:07:08,640
Rym: But I think when you said black cab, I think he thought you were racist.

131
00:07:10,321 --> 00:07:11,245
Scott: But that guy wasn't black.

132
00:07:11,587 --> 00:07:14,740
Rym: I know but he was dark-skinned and I think he thought you were being racist.

133
00:07:15,262 --> 00:07:18,415
Scott: No, I was referring to the color of his car, but he tried to argue with us too.

134
00:07:18,455 --> 00:07:24,140
Rym: We were like, all right All right, how much to take us to magfest to where we are going?

135
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:29,340
Rym: He's like 75 bucks and I've taken cabs to magfest a bunch of times already.

136
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:33,460
Scott: $75 is more than the combined cost of getting all of us to DC on the bus.

137
00:07:33,922 --> 00:07:36,335
Rym: I was like, it's 35 in a yellow cab.

138
00:07:36,496 --> 00:07:38,463
Rym: go away Wouldn't go away.

139
00:07:38,945 --> 00:07:44,460
Rym: and eventually we got we all crammed into a real cab and that cabbie thought this whole thing was hilarious.

140
00:07:45,684 --> 00:07:46,336
Scott: That's pretty much it.

141
00:07:46,648 --> 00:07:48,165
Rym: Yeah so moral.

142
00:07:48,266 --> 00:07:53,406
Rym: if you don't live in a big city and you're not used to this you ever get out of an Airport and a plane.

143
00:07:53,546 --> 00:07:55,755
Scott: but this only applies to major cities in the US.

144
00:07:55,815 --> 00:07:58,586
Rym: I said real city Not us world.

145
00:08:00,643 --> 00:08:02,007
Scott: You mean other places.

146
00:08:02,087 --> 00:08:05,076
Scott: I see the thing is in the rest of the world it's the same situation.

147
00:08:05,176 --> 00:08:06,380
Scott: they have regulated cab.

148
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,369
Scott: Yes, I mean London has regulated Scott in India.

149
00:08:09,409 --> 00:08:12,699
Rym: There are four levels of regulated care, but they're regulated.

150
00:08:12,739 --> 00:08:17,459
Rym: Yes Okay, in fact, they're regulated to a surprising and comforting degree.

151
00:08:17,499 --> 00:08:22,220
Scott: the price The thing is wherever you are don't get into an unregulated cab.

152
00:08:22,441 --> 00:08:22,722
Scott: Yes.

153
00:08:22,963 --> 00:08:43,227
Rym: now in more importantly if you're going to a I don't want to say normal but like a kind of Standard place like a major global city you're going to like Berlin or Istanbul or New York or Chicago or LA or DC if you get out of any form of mass transit and are getting out of getting transportation There is a taxi stand somewhere.

154
00:08:43,568 --> 00:08:51,210
Rym: find it stand in line and a cop or some sort of uniform person will Get you ask where you're going a legitimate cab.

155
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:54,480
Rym: turn to a cab and he'll basically say take this guy where he's going.

156
00:08:54,621 --> 00:08:55,308
Rym: Don't rip him off.

157
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:56,540
Rym: We're keeping track of the shit.

158
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,551
Scott: Yeah, cuz basically the unlegitimate cabs.

159
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:00,180
Scott: what they are is their car services.

160
00:09:00,284 --> 00:09:05,715
Scott: Like, you know If you if you're fancy rich You can call an airport and the guy will wait for you with the sign with your name on it.

161
00:09:05,816 --> 00:09:09,980
Scott: when I business travel I do That and then take you ever you want and that's a car traveling for work.

162
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,660
Rym: Yeah, a car service picks me up wherever I am exactly.

163
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:17,460
Scott: But the thing with the car service is that guy who usually holds your name in the airport, right?

164
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,364
Scott: What does he do?

165
00:09:18,444 --> 00:09:19,852
Scott: and no one calls him on the phone?

166
00:09:19,972 --> 00:09:21,420
Rym: Well, he tries to rip off tourists.

167
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,373
Scott: He's not allowed legally to pick people up off the street.

168
00:09:24,413 --> 00:09:29,720
Scott: in most places like in New York City They're not allowed to pick people up off the street except in special cases like during the hurricane.

169
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,653
Scott: They said okay temporarily you can pick people up off the street, right?

170
00:09:32,995 --> 00:09:33,598
Scott: But now you can't.

171
00:09:33,658 --> 00:09:36,200
Scott: normally They've tried to pick people up off the street.

172
00:09:36,601 --> 00:09:42,460
Scott: Anyway tourists you don't know better mostly right and if they pick you up off the street, they don't have like a meter.

173
00:09:42,762 --> 00:09:44,960
Scott: They just charge you whatever the fuck they want.

174
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,987
Scott: Right and you're a stupid tourist.

175
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,570
Scott: What do you know?

176
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,860
Scott: So they'll be like, yes 75 bucks to go to the airport.

177
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:55,780
Scott: You didn't know that any yellow cab is required to take you to JFK for a flat rate from anywhere in the five boroughs.

178
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,290
Scott: Even fucking Staten Island is what like 35 40 bucks.

179
00:09:58,331 --> 00:09:58,953
Rym: It's not much.

180
00:09:59,335 --> 00:10:00,520
Scott: It doesn't even count for Staten Island.

181
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,545
Scott: They have to take you on the ferry.

182
00:10:01,605 --> 00:10:02,248
Rym: I don't think so.

183
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:03,353
Scott: I don't know.

184
00:10:03,373 --> 00:10:04,860
Scott: there they take you on the Verrazano.

185
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,145
Rym: I don't know if you know what.

186
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,592
Rym: who cares doesn't matter.

187
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,480
Scott: Okay, I'll never get in a cab.

188
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:09,962
Scott: This doesn't?

189
00:10:10,002 --> 00:10:10,905
Scott: that's not yellow.

190
00:10:10,945 --> 00:10:12,190
Scott: that has a stamp on it.

191
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:12,732
Rym: Well, it depends.

192
00:10:12,772 --> 00:10:14,759
Rym: I've been in cities where the regulated cabs are blue.

193
00:10:15,441 --> 00:10:15,962
Rym: Okay, black.

194
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:16,965
Rym: there's some other color.

195
00:10:17,065 --> 00:10:19,772
Rym: the regulated yellow cabs are real cabs.

196
00:10:20,173 --> 00:10:21,897
Rym: any other color is not a cab.

197
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:22,760
Rym: it is a scammer.

198
00:10:22,982 --> 00:10:27,000
Scott: That's right Unless you called for it on the phone in advance.

199
00:10:27,682 --> 00:10:32,498
Rym: And even then unless your business traveling probably don't want to do that because they're gonna charge you a lot of money.

200
00:10:32,518 --> 00:10:32,919
Rym: Mm-hmm.

201
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:41,896
Rym: So in the big anime news, so for the last I don't know three years Whenever we talk about anime, I'll pretty much always list old GeekNights.

202
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:42,900
Rym: You can probably verify this.

203
00:10:43,183 --> 00:10:44,299
Rym: We'll say something like man.

204
00:10:44,887 --> 00:10:45,820
Rym: There's all this new anime.

205
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:53,360
Rym: But I really just want more Ghost in the Shell which has been true ever since the last episode of standalone complex to second gig.

206
00:10:53,705 --> 00:10:59,209
Rym: Well, you might mean Society which I didn't like nearly as much as second game.

207
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,780
Scott: No, it seemed like a repeat of the original Ghost in the Shell mostly.

208
00:11:03,322 --> 00:11:06,234
Rym: Yeah, anyway, it wasn't the repeat of the original Ghost in the Shell.

209
00:11:06,254 --> 00:11:07,720
Rym: It was just a kind of pedestrian.

210
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,584
Rym: I don't it was.

211
00:11:08,986 --> 00:11:11,459
Rym: it wasn't as good as standalone complex.

212
00:11:12,483 --> 00:11:23,672
Rym: But I want procedural cyberpunk drama with yokocato music and Makoto Kusanagi more than I want pretty much anything else in anime that's feasible.

213
00:11:24,234 --> 00:11:37,811
Rym: and yet for a long time in fact a person I will not name Four goddamn years ago gave me these rumors about Ghost in the Shell stuff that he claimed were super legit and because of his connections I trusted him and none of that ever panned out.

214
00:11:37,892 --> 00:11:38,835
Rym: So he must have been lying.

215
00:11:39,378 --> 00:11:39,438
Scott: Mmm.

216
00:11:40,061 --> 00:11:42,380
Rym: But anyway new Ghost in the Shell is coming.

217
00:11:43,243 --> 00:11:44,988
Rym: We know almost nothing about it.

218
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:46,632
Rym: So the theory of the things we know.

219
00:11:46,853 --> 00:11:49,180
Rym: one it is called Ghost in the Shell Arise.

220
00:11:49,982 --> 00:11:51,988
Rym: Two no yokocato music.

221
00:11:52,288 --> 00:11:53,211
Rym: I've been told.

222
00:11:53,532 --> 00:11:56,199
Rym: three Kenji Kameyama has nothing to do with it.

223
00:11:57,165 --> 00:12:01,727
Rym: four it is not a Straight sequel to standalone complex.

224
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,592
Rym: It'll have a different aesthetic or style.

225
00:12:04,033 --> 00:12:06,800
Rym: that has been said, but that is not verified by anyone official.

226
00:12:07,523 --> 00:12:12,727
Rym: But it is production IG and the character design Looks like a slight departure.

227
00:12:12,747 --> 00:12:17,664
Rym: It looks like the the younger body that Makoto used at the end of first gig Mm-hmm.

228
00:12:17,925 --> 00:12:20,480
Rym: Remember in the airport and everything which was in that like younger body?

229
00:12:21,042 --> 00:12:29,860
Rym: It looks a lot like that with like cropped hair, but she's got that same vaguely pissed off Kusanagi look that I know and love and surprisingly small breasts.

230
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:38,985
Rym: Okay, so the only other thing we can say is that the first episode is streaming worldwide live on February 12th at 9 p.m.

231
00:12:39,005 --> 00:12:39,347
Rym: In Japan.

232
00:12:42,447 --> 00:12:46,371
Rym: Okay Or it is the production presentation.

233
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,300
Rym: We're not sure exactly what that will entail.

234
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:56,528
Rym: Then there is a commemoration special night in Rapunzel's I. it's sold out apparently so you can't go.

235
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:57,671
Scott: Well, that's good.

236
00:12:57,691 --> 00:12:58,253
Scott: Yeah.

237
00:12:58,934 --> 00:13:08,080
Rym: I'm pretty excited about this, but I wonder Yoko Kanno and Kenji Kamiyama kind of defined the kind of ghost in the shell TV show that I like.

238
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,847
Rym: It's the only one but I really liked it.

239
00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:10,891
Rym: So I'm curious.

240
00:13:10,931 --> 00:13:11,714
Rym: How different will it be?

241
00:13:11,755 --> 00:13:17,388
Rym: Will it be at least Ponderous and oshi Tacular, will it be shirotastic?

242
00:13:17,428 --> 00:13:18,089
Rym: I don't think so.

243
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:21,699
Scott: No, it doesn't really matter right because it's not a moe.

244
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:24,120
Rym: I am so excited.

245
00:13:24,321 --> 00:13:28,678
Scott: Thing you would see it on the anime chart and think it was a fake anime chart.

246
00:13:28,739 --> 00:13:34,608
Rym: therefore Oh my god, so a guy Kazuchika Kisei is directing it.

247
00:13:34,628 --> 00:13:36,860
Rym: I actually did not recognize his name at all.

248
00:13:37,182 --> 00:13:38,754
Rym: So I went in and I got the high hopes.

249
00:13:38,815 --> 00:13:46,240
Rym: now, you know, I He had a part in a lot of things that most of them are animation director and key animation.

250
00:13:46,421 --> 00:13:52,420
Rym: So that is the kind of person who usually does really well when they direct a sort of stand by never directed anything.

251
00:13:53,602 --> 00:13:55,360
Rym: I'm looking through I'm trying to stall for time.

252
00:13:55,601 --> 00:14:03,654
Rym: Look he mostly did key animation for a ton of stuff including the heroic Legend of Arslan your favorite Yeah, and the Escaflowne movie.

253
00:14:03,956 --> 00:14:04,138
Scott: Mm-hmm.

254
00:14:04,681 --> 00:14:10,819
Rym: So, I don't know what key animators who then have a bigger role in production seem to always do pretty well.

255
00:14:12,462 --> 00:14:13,980
Rym: Animation director key animation.

256
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,088
Scott: Finally an anime to watch the end.

257
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:25,024
Rym: Well, so there is anime to watch because I'm actually watching space brothers and so is Emily and it's super good Super super good.

258
00:14:25,044 --> 00:14:31,660
Rym: You should all watch it if you're even close to a fan of anime and or space space space.

259
00:14:33,169 --> 00:14:34,039
Rym: So what do you got got news?

260
00:14:34,621 --> 00:14:34,922
Rym: So

261
00:14:35,063 --> 00:14:50,873
Scott: you may know if you are a listener of this show or you know a nerd of the internets There is a person who is named Casey Green and that person is the creator of such funny webcomics as gun show Also the sub comic of gun show the anime club.

262
00:14:51,335 --> 00:14:53,401
Scott: Oh shit the funniest Right.

263
00:14:53,903 --> 00:15:03,013
Scott: This person is now doing a comic for money at boom studios That is based on the Cartoon Network show known as regular show.

264
00:15:03,113 --> 00:15:05,500
Scott: I have watched one episode of regular show.

265
00:15:05,842 --> 00:15:09,606
Rym: I do not terribly enjoy the regular show But again, I have not seen much of it.

266
00:15:09,686 --> 00:15:12,680
Scott: I've seen one episode and I also did not terribly enjoy it.

267
00:15:12,921 --> 00:15:15,740
Rym: I know I have to give it a decent benefit of the doubt.

268
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:21,560
Rym: I gotta watch a bunch of some point because I had a similar opinion of Adventure Time when I saw a couple random episodes early.

269
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:26,013
Rym: But Adventure Time is now literally my second favorite current ongoing show.

270
00:15:26,113 --> 00:15:27,357
Rym: second only to my little pony.

271
00:15:27,377 --> 00:15:28,040
Rym: friendship is magic.

272
00:15:28,321 --> 00:15:30,860
Scott: But anyway, uh, he's making this comic now.

273
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:35,260
Scott: So I'll probably buy at least one issue and I can say my sister really likes his show.

274
00:15:35,441 --> 00:15:49,399
Scott: I was like, eh, I watched the whole episode But I really liked the character design of the high-five ghost because I mean hell it's a ghost and has a giant hand on top of its head and high fives and What's better than that except for an actual boo?

275
00:15:51,981 --> 00:15:54,448
Rym: All right, so I've thoroughly examined this.

276
00:15:55,070 --> 00:16:11,410
Rym: Kazuchika Kisei has basically done nothing but Animation in some capacity for a ridiculous number of different anime all over the place from the weathering continent to angelic lair and Xxx this person I think he's pretty old.

277
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,456
Rym: I don't know much about him says he's born in 65 in Osaka.

278
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:21,738
Scott: Yeah, so actually he was incredibly young When he was making some of those animes in the 80s dude, he worked on black magic m66.

279
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:24,644
Scott: Yeah, what year I?

280
00:16:24,664 --> 00:16:27,091
Scott: so what year did black black jack, right?

281
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,575
Scott: So what year was black magic m66 from?

282
00:16:28,595 --> 00:16:28,776
Scott: my god?

283
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,143
Rym: I watched that.

284
00:16:31,284 --> 00:16:33,170
Rym: I rented it from a blockbuster.

285
00:16:33,211 --> 00:16:33,512
Rym: I think 87.

286
00:16:33,512 --> 00:16:33,813
Rym: It's from 87.

287
00:16:33,813 --> 00:16:39,290
Scott: So he was 22 when he was working on that.

288
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:45,980
Rym: dudes been working on anime for a while Yeah, and I don't think he has any straight-up director credit to his name.

289
00:16:46,481 --> 00:16:57,338
Rym: Well, it says he was the animation director of a lot of these animation director a mechanical animation director chief animation director at character Design and key animator in the vast majority of things he has done.

290
00:16:57,358 --> 00:17:01,639
Rym: All right I will learn more about him well before it goes in the shell happen so I can talk about him.

291
00:17:02,661 --> 00:17:05,169
Rym: This also reminded me that the weathering continent exists.

292
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:06,453
Rym: I kind of want to watch it again.

293
00:17:06,473 --> 00:17:08,520
Rym: all you have you ever seen it?

294
00:17:08,881 --> 00:17:09,483
Scott: I've heard of it.

295
00:17:10,065 --> 00:17:11,409
Rym: Every anime fan has heard of it.

296
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:12,050
Rym: I've never.

297
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:12,473
Scott: I know it's.

298
00:17:12,553 --> 00:17:14,599
Scott: I know it's like a stereotypical fantasy thing.

299
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,267
Rym: I've never met anyone.

300
00:17:16,347 --> 00:17:16,910
Scott: I guess it goes.

301
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:21,483
Scott: it hangs out on Fridays with Legend of Lemnier.

302
00:17:21,763 --> 00:17:28,075
Rym: Oh my god, I guess I've never met anyone who I was friends with who had watched it But everyone had heard of it.

303
00:17:28,821 --> 00:17:44,676
Rym: Anyway, oh and I should mention it because while we often don't go to Otakon anymore or don't often Yeah, we broke our basically decade-long streak nine year streak Yeah, almost I said basically a decade not actually a decade round seven maybe seven eight years and whatever.

304
00:17:44,676 --> 00:17:46,484
Rym: 2002 was the first one We went to.

305
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:48,160
Rym: so two three four five six seven eight.

306
00:17:49,264 --> 00:17:54,499
Rym: Okay, anyway This first Otakon we went to the concert was what the para para thing?

307
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,205
Scott: Yep, which I didn't actually go to.

308
00:17:56,466 --> 00:17:58,253
Rym: I went to the dance thing for it later.

309
00:17:58,895 --> 00:18:01,887
Rym: The next one we went to I think it was TM revolution.

310
00:18:01,907 --> 00:18:04,940
Rym: Mm-hmm, and it was a pretty boss fucking concert.

311
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:10,474
Rym: So not too long later, actually, I think it's actually quite a bit long later.

312
00:18:11,096 --> 00:18:20,247
Rym: we had the opportunity in 2008 okay, so it was a long time later to interview TM revolution the frontman.

313
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:21,692
Scott: there's a GeekNights episode about it.

314
00:18:21,712 --> 00:18:22,796
Rym: I think yes, I'm gonna link to it.

315
00:18:22,836 --> 00:18:24,060
Rym: We're really small.

316
00:18:24,281 --> 00:18:25,245
Rym: We reviewed.

317
00:18:25,265 --> 00:18:26,852
Scott: did I say that enough the first time?

318
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:28,780
Rym: I think I. not only did you say that a lot?

319
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,685
Rym: But I commented it.

320
00:18:29,746 --> 00:18:31,599
Scott: how you said is probably smaller than Jon Stewart.

321
00:18:33,285 --> 00:18:42,154
Rym: We did a bunch of things like there was a cop like the six-month span where we did a bunch of things with Tokyo FM and Kinokuniya and all there's this whole like thing we were doing.

322
00:18:42,194 --> 00:18:43,460
Rym: that kind of faded away.

323
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,746
Rym: I wonder if we should do that again.

324
00:18:44,826 --> 00:18:55,460
Rym: Anyway, so we reviewed Maurice the chojo On April 23rd 2008 and we talked about how we got to perform an interview with TM revolution.

325
00:18:55,924 --> 00:18:56,145
Rym: mr.

326
00:18:56,186 --> 00:19:05,990
Rym: Takanori Nishikawa, and He's a super cool dude, like he's actually he answered our questions The way normal people would answer questions.

327
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:08,559
Rym: He didn't do the kind of expected Japanese dodges.

328
00:19:08,961 --> 00:19:11,429
Scott: No, he was totally just a chill guy like whatever.

329
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,420
Rym: Yeah, also motherfuckers pretty mother.

330
00:19:14,561 --> 00:19:15,665
Scott: Well, he had so much makeup.

331
00:19:15,685 --> 00:19:16,790
Rym: He was covered in makeup.

332
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:17,934
Rym: You know what he was pretty.

333
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:22,405
Scott: if I covered makeup I'll be pretty too and I shook his hand so would anybody.

334
00:19:22,446 --> 00:19:28,399
Rym: and then on the way out there's all the because they're a bunch of Fangirls from Japan who won a contest who came to the US with him for his tour.

335
00:19:29,062 --> 00:19:35,520
Rym: So they were there watching the whole interview in Kinokuniya and I high-fived one of them and they went And it was hilarious.

336
00:19:36,422 --> 00:19:39,440
Rym: So I'm gonna link to all that stuff because that was a surprising blast from the past.

337
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,559
Rym: But yes, Otakon is bringing him back for another concert this year now.

338
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,308
Scott: Well, that's kind of awesome.

339
00:19:46,368 --> 00:19:50,536
Scott: at the same time kind of repeats to quote.

340
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,089
Rym: Who cares if it's a repeat.

341
00:19:53,149 --> 00:19:53,470
Rym: how long?

342
00:19:53,531 --> 00:19:56,080
Scott: I mean, yeah, it's been a while right so it's not too bad.

343
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,320
Scott: Let's see 2000. has he done any songs for new anime newer than Gundam seed?

344
00:20:00,721 --> 00:20:07,900
Rym: Let's see TM Revolution has since performed a string of anime hits for bleach Helver Sengoku Basara the gray man.

345
00:20:08,162 --> 00:20:11,102
Rym: Okay, Ken should solely it Solely it.

346
00:20:11,122 --> 00:20:13,870
Scott: Hey, dude, so this guy's actually been in the game.

347
00:20:13,891 --> 00:20:16,860
Scott: Oh wait gonna see think about this team revolution.

348
00:20:17,001 --> 00:20:19,079
Scott: How long has he been a rock star?

349
00:20:20,523 --> 00:20:32,475
Rym: For a fucking long ass time, that's how long He said and I quote this is from the anime news network article in some other context I never imagined when I made my debut that I would be doing this when I was over 40.

350
00:20:32,475 --> 00:20:33,880
Rym: That is not bad at all.

351
00:20:35,981 --> 00:20:38,011
Scott: So I just you know, I just think that you know.

352
00:20:38,031 --> 00:20:50,437
Scott: on the one hand it's like yeah, okay It's okay to bring him back But if you bring him back like every six seven years, okay Have a question for you because we talked about this at length when we wanted.

353
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:51,460
Scott: you want to compare it to packs.

354
00:20:53,202 --> 00:20:53,423
Scott: When

355
00:20:53,503 --> 00:21:11,997
Rym: we were staff at Otakon, I had many conversations with other staff about this and It is my impression and correct me if you believe that I'm wrong that in a six-year span the vast majority of people who went to the Otakon at the beginning of that are not the ones who are there at the end of

356
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:12,198
Scott: that.

357
00:21:12,218 --> 00:21:12,660
Scott: that is true.

358
00:21:13,222 --> 00:21:18,980
Rym: So it's pretty much a brand new concert to 90% yeah of the people at Otakon at least 90%.

359
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:25,819
Rym: So I will say this if you go to one anime convention a year It should be anime Boston cuz I know Boston super fun.

360
00:21:26,162 --> 00:21:28,980
Scott: If you go to two Boston also usually gets amazing musical guests.

361
00:21:30,182 --> 00:21:45,536
Rym: If you go to two go to anime Boston and Otakon, but if you go to Otakon Definitely go to the TM revolution concert because it is this High energy music that you might have forgotten exists well, and when we saw it we were in that.

362
00:21:45,556 --> 00:21:46,599
Scott: you know main events.

363
00:21:46,699 --> 00:21:47,968
Scott: now This is gonna be in.

364
00:21:48,109 --> 00:21:50,937
Scott: you know I guess the arena right I hope does that still exist?

365
00:21:50,957 --> 00:21:56,159
Rym: well When we hurt back when we were on the staff the city was saying they're gonna tear the arena down to rebuild.

366
00:21:56,179 --> 00:21:57,183
Scott: knows What's going on there?

367
00:21:57,203 --> 00:21:57,665
Scott: I don't know.

368
00:21:57,726 --> 00:21:57,886
Scott: I have.

369
00:21:57,927 --> 00:21:59,172
Scott: no I haven't been to be more.

370
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:05,560
Rym: I'm gladly oh Yeah, and kids if you want us to be at Otakon and perform will happily perform if they let us.

371
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:15,799
Rym: but I have it on good authority from an Otakon staffer as a Three months ago who said we're still on a sort of unofficial blacklist, and they won't let us come and do performances, okay,

372
00:22:15,819 --> 00:22:21,421
Scott: so Maybe get TMR can tell them hey We should

373
00:22:21,441 --> 00:22:25,636
Rym: start headlining with that anime boss if you should always come out and be like banded Otakon.

374
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:26,480
Rym: It's Rym and Scott.

375
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:35,725
Rym: Also anime Boston panel submissions end tomorrow The 31st at midnight.

376
00:22:35,805 --> 00:22:44,760
Rym: so if you want to submit a panel to anime Boston to make Luerata very happy You've got very little time to do so you can also submit a panel to kinetic.

377
00:22:44,961 --> 00:22:45,626
Scott: Oh, he was going right.

378
00:22:45,667 --> 00:22:47,540
Scott: we skipping over the way for the meta moment, okay?

379
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,703
Rym: We're waiting wait wait.

380
00:22:48,763 --> 00:22:49,264

Scott: some guy or girl?

387
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:04,260
Scott: I don't even know.

388
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:13,125
Scott: Made a to get their bachelor's degree in animation from I guess the animations something school in Denmark somewhere Right here.

389
00:23:13,145 --> 00:23:13,990
Scott: click on the link.

390
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,056
Scott: It's in the first tab there.

391
00:23:15,096 --> 00:23:15,700
Scott: Let me see what it says.

392
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,134
Rym: You need me to pull up your research.

393
00:23:17,235 --> 00:23:19,708
Rym: Yeah Award from animation workshop.

394
00:23:19,768 --> 00:23:21,757
Rym: Emily can talk at length about animation.

395
00:23:21,837 --> 00:23:24,790
Scott: animation workshop I guess is a college of animation in Denmark.

396
00:23:24,951 --> 00:23:25,835
Scott: in the board.

397
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:26,317
Rym: the board.

398
00:23:26,337 --> 00:23:26,960
Scott: what a great name.

399
00:23:27,262 --> 00:23:28,652
Scott: So this guy who is?

400
00:23:28,713 --> 00:23:29,580
Scott: who's the name of the person?

401
00:23:31,022 --> 00:23:31,584
Scott: It doesn't say.

402
00:23:31,685 --> 00:23:34,819
Scott: anyway this person made this animation to get their bachelor's degree.

403
00:23:36,182 --> 00:23:37,287
Scott: I guess they had a lot of help.

404
00:23:37,327 --> 00:23:43,351
Rym: film by the directed by Mikkel mains Echoljere, okay, I'm really sorry for my.

405
00:23:43,371 --> 00:23:45,600
Scott: they have a whole bunch of other credits of people who helped them.

406
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,860
Scott: So I guess it must have been a project of multiple students together.

407
00:23:49,061 --> 00:23:53,540
Rym: Scott if one person made this on their own either it took a decade or they are insane.

408
00:23:54,742 --> 00:23:56,590
Scott: Come on daikon animation.

409
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:57,553
Rym: right daikon.

410
00:23:57,594 --> 00:23:59,160
Rym: How long is the daikon animation?

411
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,466
Scott: It's this is a lot less frames.

412
00:24:01,566 --> 00:24:05,138
Rym: How many people made the daikon animation about the same number?

413
00:24:05,299 --> 00:24:05,520
Rym: Yeah?

414
00:24:07,101 --> 00:24:14,340
Scott: So anyway, this is you know a pretty awesome video of just two guys going on a fantasy adventure.

415
00:24:14,582 --> 00:24:19,024
Scott: It's pretty fantastic Totally worth the handful of minutes.

416
00:24:19,064 --> 00:24:19,985
Scott: It takes you to watch it.

417
00:24:20,426 --> 00:24:23,090
Scott: So definitely watch this short video.

418
00:24:25,242 --> 00:24:36,640
Scott: You know, I wish that these people would make something that was long and for serious especially with their Monster designs and and setting designs because that would be I really like really cool.

419
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,520
Rym: The montage like bit really reminded me of the montage and brave.

420
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,460
Scott: The whole thing is a montage except for the scene of the exam the scene in the city and the scene at the end.

421
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:51,360
Rym: It reminds me of a story them because they see busy opener montage middle part montage ending.

422
00:24:51,884 --> 00:24:55,043
Rym: The end is pretty good to like you can see it coming from the beginning But it's a good it.

423
00:24:55,866 --> 00:24:58,596
Rym: This is a work that has a pretty good moral.

424
00:24:58,616 --> 00:25:10,170
Rym: Yep Also the main character, I guess the first guy Kind of a monkey wizard or wizard kind of boy half warrior Kind of reminds me of our friend Conrad.

425
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:12,200
Rym: but a lot of things remind me of our friend Conrad.

426
00:25:12,502 --> 00:25:17,045
Scott: I actually would you know, I prefer the Cowboy warrior guide.

427
00:25:17,085 --> 00:25:17,285
Scott: Yeah.

428
00:25:17,546 --> 00:25:21,180
Scott: Well that guy to the drunk wizard guy, but at the end they're both awesome.

429
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:26,060
Rym: Yeah, well because the drunk wizard guy once he has his his full beard like his full potential.

430
00:25:27,581 --> 00:25:28,525
Rym: That is some shit.

431
00:25:28,846 --> 00:25:31,417
Rym: That's the kind of guy who helps you get to La Patena Ghibli movie.

432
00:25:31,457 --> 00:25:32,020
Scott: That's right.

433
00:25:33,021 --> 00:25:40,709
Rym: So my thing is that I bring this up surprisingly often in casual conversation And I realized that most people don't actually know what I'm talking about.

434
00:25:41,311 --> 00:25:43,800
Rym: The City of London is actually tiny.

435
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,439
Rym: It's smaller than the City of Beacon.

436
00:25:46,284 --> 00:25:51,460
Rym: Okay London is separate from the City of London and surrounds the City of London.

437
00:25:51,666 --> 00:25:56,337
Rym: Okay this is a video that explains the fullness of what the deal is.

438
00:25:56,437 --> 00:25:58,101
Rym: and the thing is The.

439
00:25:58,322 --> 00:26:03,360
Rym: the same people did a video that explains the difference between Albion Britain Great Britain the United Kingdom and that.

440
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:04,786
Rym: So you can watch that.

441
00:26:05,288 --> 00:26:07,940
Scott: Why don't they just reshuffle their names to not be stupid?

442
00:26:08,422 --> 00:26:29,480
Rym: Uh, so the history of why London is the way it is and why you can say oh the City of London is tiny It's only like a square mile is actually pretty goddamn Badass and this video does a very good job of explaining it and the people who make these videos do a really good job of Explaining stuff to a pretty good degree of accuracy and I just I recommend watching.

443
00:26:29,641 --> 00:26:33,495
Scott: I made up a bunch of bullshit and you totally eat it ate it fell for it.

444
00:26:33,655 --> 00:26:34,519
Rym: No, this is legit.

445
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:36,408
Rym: Okay This is straight legit possible.

446
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,453
Rym: It's pretty cool.

447
00:26:37,533 --> 00:26:38,800
Rym: the secret history of London.

448
00:26:39,021 --> 00:26:40,808
Scott: All right, so metamoment.

449
00:26:40,868 --> 00:26:43,620
Scott: so metamoment number one was send panels to animate Boston.

450
00:26:43,781 --> 00:26:45,889
Rym: Yes, you've got not much time.

451
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:48,480
Scott: metamoment number two send panels to Connecticut.

452
00:26:48,842 --> 00:26:51,355
Rym: Yes, who approves panels for Connecticut?

453
00:26:51,375 --> 00:26:56,440
Rym: We do me And a third person.

454
00:26:56,721 --> 00:27:00,480
Scott: Also, we're gonna need some even more staff at Connecticut.

455
00:27:00,962 --> 00:27:07,999
Scott: So if you want to go to Connecticut for zero dollars at least on the badge price And you want to get a reference for staff?

456
00:27:09,183 --> 00:27:14,927
Rym: There is a whole process for people joining the staff normally But we can fast-track you.

457
00:27:15,048 --> 00:27:17,494
Rym: if one you are actually a competent.

458
00:27:17,555 --> 00:27:19,460
Scott: We are going to make you do work.

459
00:27:20,421 --> 00:27:32,740
Scott: It's not gonna be just hey, we snuck you in for free because you listen to us or you like us It's you come to Connecticut you spend quite a few hours a day Doing our bidding and then maybe you can play some board games with the other hours.

460
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:50,360
Scott: But more importantly Connecticut is a pretty awesome con and it's in everything con like but it is officially geekery you're into be it anime or board games or sci-fi TV shows or book reading or Fucking cosplay of course and anything it is at Connecticut.

461
00:27:51,947 --> 00:27:53,394
Scott: I don't care if you're one of those nerds.

462
00:27:53,414 --> 00:27:53,655
Scott: We're like.

463
00:27:53,695 --> 00:27:54,800
Scott: all you do is play magic.

464
00:27:54,921 --> 00:27:55,244
Scott: Guess what?

465
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,780
Scott: There's a ton of magic playing at Connecticut.

466
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,511
Scott: If you're one of those people all you do is read manga.

467
00:27:59,551 --> 00:28:01,419
Scott: Guess what tons of manga at Connecticut.

468
00:28:01,459 --> 00:28:03,188
Rym: here I'm gonna read for you some of the panel submissions.

469
00:28:03,208 --> 00:28:05,500
Rym: We got to give you all you read is silver age spider-man.

470
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:06,472
Scott: There's a little bit of silver.

471
00:28:06,513 --> 00:28:10,288
Rym: a spider-man Sewing clip-on cat ears a workshop.

472
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:11,713
Rym: What's the scenario?

473
00:28:11,793 --> 00:28:13,640
Rym: writing tips for serial authors?

474
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,011
Rym: advanced skills for RPG game masters.

475
00:28:17,573 --> 00:28:19,040
Rym: gone to the sled dogs.

476
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:25,220
Rym: That is a panel on mushing like through the Arctic and the Yukon with the sled and dogs.

477
00:28:25,541 --> 00:28:29,800
Rym: Well, that is the car the happiest homestuck panel.

478
00:28:32,962 --> 00:28:35,270
Rym: We will review it fairly and honestly, well, we do not.

479
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:37,317
Scott: we just you know, we had to you know.

480
00:28:37,458 --> 00:28:41,235
Scott: at the one hand We have to always judge to based on the highest quality presenters.

481
00:28:41,295 --> 00:28:44,123
Scott: if there is multiple Homestuck submitters, right?

482
00:28:44,163 --> 00:28:51,968
Scott: We can't accept all of them because we need to balance the content, you know in equal parts web comics and Animes and video games and such and such.

483
00:28:52,129 --> 00:28:57,934
Scott: now here's the biggest reason cream of the crop Why you should submit panels to Connecticut one?

484
00:28:57,954 --> 00:29:00,879
Rym: We have a lot of big rooms But we have a lot of small rooms too.

485
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:06,100
Rym: So if you want to get into the running panels at cons game We can put you in a relatively small room.

486
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:09,280
Rym: You'll get a pretty big crowd and you can kind of get the feel for all this.

487
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,039
Scott: Yeah, last year we had this one tiny room.

488
00:29:11,281 --> 00:29:15,940
Scott: We put all these newbie panel people in there and half of them were awesome and two of them didn't even show up.

489
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,054
Scott: Yeah, so if you show up, you're already doing really well.

490
00:29:19,476 --> 00:29:24,482
Rym: more importantly magfest as we learned recently does not get Nearly.

491
00:29:24,803 --> 00:29:28,555
Rym: magfest gets so few panel submissions relative to what they should.

492
00:29:29,157 --> 00:29:30,180
Rym: that is kind of sad.

493
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:52,096
Rym: So if you submit a panel that's related to gaming to Connecticut and we accept it and you do a good job I will totally straight up recommend you to magfest and other conventions like it Because I don't know if you guys realize this the people who run the panels departments that all the cons on the East Coast We all know each other like we literally share information about all of you.

494
00:29:52,277 --> 00:29:55,980
Scott: other meta moments The book club book is the Great Gatsby by F Scott Fitzgerald.

495
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:58,371
Rym: It'll take you like an hour to read it.

496
00:29:58,391 --> 00:30:01,445
Scott: if it takes you longer than an hour You're not reading enough books.

497
00:30:01,485 --> 00:30:02,770
Scott: You got to get your reading skills up.

498
00:30:02,991 --> 00:30:04,980
Rym: And if you hate it, that's fine.

499
00:30:05,723 --> 00:30:10,180
Scott: If you know famous and whatnot, it's important to have read it like it or not.

500
00:30:10,321 --> 00:30:13,153
Rym: If you don't respect it cuz I just read it.

501
00:30:13,193 --> 00:30:13,655
Rym: I'm done with it.

502
00:30:13,675 --> 00:30:14,820
Rym: We're you are very miss.

503
00:30:15,102 --> 00:30:22,980
Rym: Yeah, it is a. it is a well-written book And if you like the Kingkiller Chronicles more than you like the Great Gatsby, that's a problem.

504
00:30:23,163 --> 00:30:24,180
Rym: I really feel sorry.

505
00:30:27,084 --> 00:30:29,911
Rym: Okay, well we got a bunch of videos up from magfest.

506
00:30:30,493 --> 00:30:33,120
Rym: I did an unofficial Twitter poll last-metamoment thing.

507
00:30:34,141 --> 00:30:35,787
Rym: We have limited resources.

508
00:30:35,807 --> 00:30:44,314
Rym: So one if you want more videos to come out spread the word on our videos to places To someone linked from reddit to our beyond dungeons and dragons.

509
00:30:44,595 --> 00:30:46,140
Rym: I can't figure out where on reddit.

510
00:30:46,221 --> 00:30:47,390
Rym: So if you know where that link is, let me know.

511
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:47,915
Rym: I'm curious.

512
00:30:48,278 --> 00:30:56,040
Rym: three I'm either gonna upload our third panel from magfest a new radio free equestria or a new GeekNights presents utenna.

513
00:30:56,764 --> 00:30:59,380
Rym: You guys need to tell me which one you want us to do next.

514
00:30:59,922 --> 00:31:03,857
Rym: The votes are actually completely equal right now based on emails and tweets.

515
00:31:03,897 --> 00:31:07,539
Rym: I got Mmm, so you alone might push me over the edge.

516
00:31:08,668 --> 00:31:10,911
Rym: That's all You should.

517
00:31:10,931 --> 00:31:12,380
Scott: I sent out another newsletter.

518
00:31:13,141 --> 00:31:18,720
Scott: People seem to like it, but the newsletter needs number one Q&A because it has a Q&A section.

519
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:21,373
Scott: So we need cues to a and number two.

520
00:31:21,434 --> 00:31:24,627
Scott: it has a fan art section Which doesn't necessarily have to be drawings.

521
00:31:24,668 --> 00:31:30,387
Scott: It could be art of any kind of any medium that is digitally Form of a cornucopia.

522
00:31:30,407 --> 00:31:32,556
Scott: Yeah cornucopia is there are good.

523
00:31:32,636 --> 00:31:33,480
Scott: Yeah, anything like that?

524
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:41,750
Scott: Even though it's out of season, you know, but any sort of GeekNights fan created work You know can go in that section.

525
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:43,820
Scott: that section has been mostly empty for a while.

526
00:31:43,961 --> 00:31:50,675
Scott: So if you submit pretty much anything You'll have no competition and we'll probably get straight into the newsletter now also hit.

527
00:31:51,196 --> 00:31:55,298
Rym: if it's a YouTube video I might do something with that.

528
00:31:56,082 --> 00:31:59,012
Rym: If it's audio, I might also do something with that.

529
00:31:59,052 --> 00:32:00,416
Rym: Just saying just saying

530
00:32:00,777 --> 00:32:01,139
Scott: anyway

531
00:32:01,179 --> 00:32:06,620
Rym: saying So we're talking about two comics because I've actually been reading a bunch of comics lately

532
00:32:06,944 --> 00:32:32,708
Scott: Because I've you know Everyone knows I get a box of comics in the mail every month and pretty much what's been happening for the past Year or so is I would get it and I would read Bakuman immediately I would read 20th Century Boys immediately I would read ponies immediately You know there are certain ones that I read immediately and everything else sort of go on the shelf and wait right and Only in the past month or two.

533
00:32:32,788 --> 00:32:35,780
Scott: I started to try to dig through the shelf and burn through.

534
00:32:37,202 --> 00:32:44,100
Rym: It's been gaming season for a while here on GeekNights But I'm starting to feel I think an anime comic season is gonna like suddenly come up.

535
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,700
Scott: Well, I think what I've done is I don't think gaming season is over.

536
00:32:46,781 --> 00:32:48,940
Scott: I think what I've done with gaming season they've concentrated.

537
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:53,518
Scott: I'm only playing two games that begin with N, natural selection 2 and Android netrunner.

538
00:32:53,699 --> 00:32:57,100
Rym: right now I'm pretty much only playing counter-strike and XCOM.

539
00:32:57,883 --> 00:33:04,718
Scott: So by focusing on only two games and not playing any other games that leaves a whole lot of room for all these other geekeries to to step in.

540
00:33:05,628 --> 00:33:08,886
Rym: But also I'm watched I think adventure times.

541
00:33:08,926 --> 00:33:09,207
Rym: what did it?

542
00:33:09,227 --> 00:33:22,200
Rym: because I burned through adventure time and you know when you're watching a show that goes on For a while and like you're catching up and then you hit like the most recent episode you have this wall of oh now I gotta wait Like watching Escaflowne episode by episode or VHS tape by VHS tape.

543
00:33:22,581 --> 00:33:26,759
Rym: I think that forced me to start consuming other media and I started watching all these anime again.

544
00:33:27,462 --> 00:33:29,690
Rym: All right, so let's talk about the short one first.

545
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:31,035
Rym: We only read one issue of this.

546
00:33:31,637 --> 00:33:32,500
Rym: Scott just came over.

547
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:36,415
Scott: Okay, so the deal with this is you know Dark Horse?

548
00:33:36,455 --> 00:33:42,700
Scott: if you don't know this right Dark Horse Comics has the licenses to a lot of things including Star Wars.

549
00:33:43,142 --> 00:33:53,220
Scott: So they whenever you see Star Wars stuff in your comic book store There is a very good chance that Dark Horse made that thing be it a statue or a comic or or anything, right?

550
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,146
Scott: So I guess not.

551
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:58,918
Scott: the game Star Wars games are by someone else but Star Wars everything else is by Dark Horse.

552
00:33:58,938 --> 00:34:04,733
Scott: So There's a ton of fucking Star Wars comics covering everything you can imagine.

553
00:34:04,753 --> 00:34:06,920
Scott: there are ones that just retell the original trilogy.

554
00:34:07,263 --> 00:34:13,956
Scott: There's you know Old Republic Shadows of the Empire and these things have been going on for at least a decade forever.

555
00:34:14,097 --> 00:34:15,060
Scott: They've been making these things.

556
00:34:15,341 --> 00:34:27,879
Scott: they cover every corner of the expanded universe and the regular universe and every kind of art style and every kind of creator and It's where do you fucking start right and the way you start where you start episode four or five six, then you stop, right?

557
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:31,829
Rym: So I mean some of them are better and TIE fighter.

558
00:34:31,849 --> 00:34:34,679
Scott: the game and the quality variation is so great.

559
00:34:34,801 --> 00:34:36,891
Scott: How would you even even if you knew what you liked right?

560
00:34:36,931 --> 00:34:38,860
Scott: It's like well, I like, you know x-wings.

561
00:34:39,041 --> 00:34:40,967
Scott: So there's a whole bunch of rogue squadron comics.

562
00:34:41,007 --> 00:34:43,315
Rym: I mean an income t65, right?

563
00:34:43,355 --> 00:34:44,398
Scott: So let me read those.

564
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:45,900
Scott: maybe you know I like that already.

565
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,167
Scott: maybe those are good and you know what.

566
00:34:47,206 --> 00:34:52,237
Scott: some of them are good and some of them are bad and it's just sort of get To do a lot of research to figure it out or waste a lot of money.

567
00:34:52,317 --> 00:34:55,060
Scott: So a New Star Wars comic is coming out.

568
00:34:55,100 --> 00:35:00,039
Scott: So I ignore it as usual But this one had two factors that made me buy it.

569
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:00,300
Scott: fact.

570
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,146
Scott: Well a few factors.

571
00:35:01,226 --> 00:35:08,700
Scott: factor number one is written by Brian wood Who is the guy who does DMZ and many other comics of interest now side point?

572
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:09,602
Rym: And we'll get it.

573
00:35:09,622 --> 00:35:10,466
Scott: talks about him in the past.

574
00:35:10,486 --> 00:35:11,812
Rym: If you look at the cover of this.

575
00:35:12,354 --> 00:35:13,620
Scott: It's a Ross cover.

576
00:35:13,965 --> 00:35:19,271
Rym: Yeah, if you don't know who that Some comics you read and it's like Brian K Vaughn.

577
00:35:19,312 --> 00:35:22,682
Rym: blah the name and everything together the author Artist.

578
00:35:22,762 --> 00:35:29,720
Rym: basically the credits are three last names hidden in the bottom left like the top left under all the other logos.

579
00:35:29,981 --> 00:35:31,666
Rym: They're basically invisible right?

580
00:35:32,167 --> 00:35:35,477
Scott: But anyway, this comic is called Star Wars number one.

581
00:35:35,537 --> 00:35:36,420
Scott: That's what it's called.

582
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,309
Scott: It's not any other sort of subcategory.

583
00:35:39,349 --> 00:35:42,699
Scott: It's not shadows of the dark republic empire the third, right?

584
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,867
Scott: It's just Star Wars number one.

585
00:35:44,907 --> 00:35:50,553
Scott: And also this first issue was extremely Discounted through my mail-order service.

586
00:35:50,614 --> 00:35:51,820
Scott: I paid almost nothing for it.

587
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,650
Rym: So Star Wars in the shadow of Yavin basically what it does.

588
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:56,857
Rym: it picks up right after episode 4.

589
00:35:56,857 --> 00:36:01,660
Scott: Yep Well Star Wars, so it's in between Star Wars before the Empire Strikes Back.

590
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,680
Scott: So it's all of your favorite characters doing what they do.

591
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:17,960
Rym: You got Han Solo Chewbacca droids Luke pretty true to character too, but despite So, well, how could you mess them which ended with the destruction of the Galactic Empire's fearsome space station the deaths?

592
00:36:18,841 --> 00:36:25,740
Rym: The fledgling rebel alliance is still struggling to find new allies new sources of supplies and most importantly a new location for its permanent base.

593
00:36:27,087 --> 00:36:28,333
Scott: Well, you know where that base is gonna be.

594
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:30,283
Scott: I Got bets.

595
00:36:30,785 --> 00:36:32,151
Scott: What do you think my bets gonna be?

596
00:36:32,292 --> 00:36:33,719
Rym: watch they're gonna have some other base.

597
00:36:33,759 --> 00:36:34,020
Rym: first.

598
00:36:34,161 --> 00:36:36,320
Rym: I have a feeling wait wait, it'll be hot.

599
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:40,653
Scott: I have a feeling the base that they're gonna find is very cold.

600
00:36:40,673 --> 00:36:49,700
Rym: My psychic powers are telling me It's gonna be on Dantooine first and then there's this whole plot where it gets blown up and then they move on who knows.

601
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:54,500
Scott: But anyway, it takes place in episodes four and five and it's pretty much there's two plots going.

602
00:36:54,641 --> 00:36:56,491
Scott: There's a few plots, but the big ones are.

603
00:36:56,933 --> 00:36:58,120
Scott: we need to find a new base.

604
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,669
Scott: We're just a fleet flying around.

605
00:36:59,931 --> 00:37:04,028
Scott: the Empire is still strong Even though we blew up the death star political thing around that.

606
00:37:04,409 --> 00:37:07,740
Scott: and then two there are some spies within the Rebel Alliance.

607
00:37:07,962 --> 00:37:13,199
Scott: Oh shit, we need some Both ends to die to find supplies.

608
00:37:14,321 --> 00:37:21,580
Rym: There's a sort of side plan Darth Vader trying to Redeem himself in the eyes of the Emperor because he basically fucked up, right?

609
00:37:22,241 --> 00:37:24,892
Scott: And there's also the side plot of Han Solo.

610
00:37:24,932 --> 00:37:26,739
Scott: got the money at the end of episode four.

611
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,665
Scott: So what do you do?

612
00:37:27,725 --> 00:37:28,490
Scott: What's he gonna do?

613
00:37:28,591 --> 00:37:30,000
Scott: Is he gonna stick with the rebels?

614
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,730
Scott: Is he gonna pay Jabba the Hutt?

615
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:33,159
Scott: is you know, what happens there?

616
00:37:34,201 --> 00:37:39,540
Scott: And I'm sure you know this comic can't go on forever because at some point it has to become Empire Strikes Back.

617
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:44,113
Scott: So, I mean how much time really was there between those two movies?

618
00:37:44,193 --> 00:37:48,205
Rym: So I'm gonna say this reading this I Actually enjoyed it a lot.

619
00:37:48,245 --> 00:37:50,634
Rym: Like I was like, alright, whatever this is gonna be garbage.

620
00:37:50,654 --> 00:37:52,340
Rym: and then I read like five pages.

621
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,127
Rym: I'm like, huh, and I'm really liking.

622
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:56,014
Rym: I'm trying to figure out why I keep stopping like.

623
00:37:56,415 --> 00:37:57,620
Rym: why am I so into this?

624
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:04,072
Rym: And there's a line that made me realize Exactly why I'm into the one about the income factory.

625
00:38:04,394 --> 00:38:14,912
Rym: the one about the income factory I guess because that I realized then that this is aimed at the kind of person who watched Star Wars and played TIE fighter either.

626
00:38:14,932 --> 00:38:22,431
Rym: that person Was in my wheelhouse.

627
00:38:22,814 --> 00:38:30,920
Rym: also Leia Fucking murders a guy like right away just shoots him right in the heart covered in blood and she's like no biggie.

628
00:38:31,641 --> 00:38:33,617
Scott: Well, did you see episode four?

629
00:38:33,798 --> 00:38:37,579
Rym: Yeah They didn't cover her in blood in episode four though.

630
00:38:38,202 --> 00:38:42,980
Rym: Also Darth Vader in this looks like he's looks pretty badass in Star Wars the movie, right?

631
00:38:44,101 --> 00:38:45,667
Rym: He looks scary.

632
00:38:45,687 --> 00:38:48,317
Scott: They made him a little exaggerated scary.

633
00:38:48,337 --> 00:38:49,079
Scott: He's huge.

634
00:38:49,401 --> 00:38:52,680
Rym: He's like bigger than everyone else by a degree that does not make sense.

635
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:58,637
Scott: It sort of looks like his mask sort of like flexes to make faces as opposed to you know in the movies It was a static

636
00:39:00,144 --> 00:39:04,597
Rym: Ever since someone made that mashup where it replaced all of the harmonica

637
00:39:04,617 --> 00:39:05,239
Scott: don't

638
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:10,699
Rym: know When they replaced all of Darth Vader's dialogue with Arnold Schwarzenegger

639
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:10,940
Scott: line.

640
00:39:10,961 --> 00:39:23,127
Rym: That's a great one also and I realized that if you turn the sound off and watch Star Wars Darth Vader's just kind of like shuffling on his feet and kind of like just being like He's only menacing with his voice.

641
00:39:23,147 --> 00:39:32,100
Rym: of course without the voice he looks actually kind of derpy yeah But this comic is super fun, I don't want to say a lot more about it because it's gonna spoil it.

642
00:39:32,361 --> 00:39:33,605
Scott: Well, I mean, I don't think it's.

643
00:39:33,625 --> 00:39:35,131
Scott: you know it's not amazing.

644
00:39:35,191 --> 00:39:36,155
Scott: I think it's it's good.

645
00:39:36,496 --> 00:39:36,717
Scott: You know.

646
00:39:36,757 --> 00:39:38,514
Scott: I'm not like oh my god I got to buy more of this.

647
00:39:38,575 --> 00:39:42,323
Scott: oh my god I'm rushing out to buy more, but it's like it's okay And it's got some of that.

648
00:39:42,644 --> 00:39:49,666
Scott: you know like Rym said the extreme Star Wars nerdiness where R2D R2T4 Give me the position on that missile.

649
00:39:50,088 --> 00:39:52,919
Rym: Yeah, do you know the difference between an R2T and an R2D?

650
00:39:53,321 --> 00:39:54,068
Rym: I'm sure you do.

651
00:39:54,593 --> 00:39:56,783
Rym: actually I Barely know.

652
00:39:56,843 --> 00:40:09,440
Scott: the point is is that if you are one of those extreme Star Wars nerds You will enjoy this and if you're one of just a regular Star Wars enjoyer of the good episodes movies You also enjoy this right so it's it's really in that exact right spot.

653
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,574
Scott: The only thing I wonder is like how canon is this?

654
00:40:12,655 --> 00:40:14,644
Scott: and really I don't give a shit You know what?

655
00:40:14,785 --> 00:40:17,560
Rym: as far as I'm concerned there is no expanded universe.

656
00:40:17,701 --> 00:40:22,760
Rym: There is the first three movies, so this is a fanfiction, and then there is this fanfic.

657
00:40:23,021 --> 00:40:27,384
Rym: We'll see we'll see how this goes, but it's sticking true to the characters And I'm enjoying it to a degree.

658
00:40:27,424 --> 00:40:31,900
Rym: that surprised me considering how much I tend to shit on comics that I'm handed by Scott.

659
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:35,538
Scott: All right, well, let's talk about the other comic that I handed to you.

660
00:40:35,598 --> 00:40:37,183
Scott: so Saga.

661
00:40:37,243 --> 00:40:38,350
Scott: here's the deal with saga.

662
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:40,060
Scott: This is a comic from image comics.

663
00:40:40,981 --> 00:40:48,338
Scott: It came out or some months ago six to twelve months ago March 2012. so well That's when issue one came out.

664
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:52,295
Scott: There's one trade paperback currently available that I believe has the first six issues.

665
00:40:52,777 --> 00:41:07,273
Scott: if I'm not mistaken and the writer of this is Brian K Vaughn of such amazing comics as why the last man X Machina Runaways, I gotta catch up Like the first chunk of X Machina that I didn't finish right.

666
00:41:07,374 --> 00:41:09,382
Scott: X Machina has been completely over I know.

667
00:41:09,462 --> 00:41:10,285
Rym: I just never finished.

668
00:41:10,365 --> 00:41:13,395
Scott: I own every volume, and I've never finished it great.

669
00:41:13,636 --> 00:41:14,559
Rym: Okay feel that bad.

670
00:41:15,661 --> 00:41:19,953
Scott: Anyway, so his new comic is saga, and you just knew right away.

671
00:41:20,314 --> 00:41:21,217
Scott: It's called saga.

672
00:41:21,377 --> 00:41:22,320
Scott: It's by Brian K Vaughn.

673
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:22,882
Scott: Who's the artist?

674
00:41:22,922 --> 00:41:26,294
Rym: cuz the arts really good the artist is Fiona staples.

675
00:41:26,715 --> 00:41:27,920
Scott: Oh, yeah, I know that name.

676
00:41:28,184 --> 00:41:29,947
Scott: Oh, it's a me I've never I think like.

677
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:41,063
Scott: it's a name where if you said Fiona staples I would have told you that's the name of a comic artist But I could not have told you like what you know she drew at all 40 dv8 gods and monsters Thunder Agents and saga.

678
00:41:41,585 --> 00:41:45,395
Scott: never heard of any of those except saga, but I've heard of Fiona staples for some reason.

679
00:41:45,456 --> 00:41:46,980
Scott: anyway art is amazing.

680
00:41:47,345 --> 00:41:48,156
Scott: That's all you got to know.

681
00:41:49,781 --> 00:41:51,285
Scott: So this comic was much hyped.

682
00:41:51,606 --> 00:41:55,256
Scott: I pre-ordered that first issue just to see the first issue.

683
00:41:55,457 --> 00:41:56,460
Scott: was it was good?

684
00:41:56,766 --> 00:41:57,094
Scott: I was like.

685
00:41:57,115 --> 00:41:58,323
Scott: no That's what I expected.

686
00:41:58,364 --> 00:42:00,130
Scott: kind of awesome comic in that first issue.

687
00:42:00,511 --> 00:42:03,120
Scott: really interesting premise right you know?

688
00:42:03,401 --> 00:42:04,106
Scott: I'll read the rest.

689
00:42:04,126 --> 00:42:05,152
Scott: so then first issue.

690
00:42:05,193 --> 00:42:06,159
Scott: I bought the first trade.

691
00:42:06,882 --> 00:42:09,209
Scott: I got the first trade, and I said oh, this is hot.

692
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:12,680
Scott: people who aren't huge comics people are even reading and talking about this.

693
00:42:13,222 --> 00:42:14,549
Scott: I'm gonna read it and find out what's up.

694
00:42:15,292 --> 00:42:16,920
Scott: You know I already read the first trade.

695
00:42:17,221 --> 00:42:17,924
Scott: So I reread.

696
00:42:18,024 --> 00:42:24,626
Scott: obviously that I mean first issue, so I reread the first issue in the trade and then kept going Once you get past that issue one.

697
00:42:24,666 --> 00:42:25,629
Scott: it was like whoa.

698
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:28,800
Scott: this is way better than the first issue.

699
00:42:29,121 --> 00:42:30,345
Scott: It just goes off the chain.

700
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:34,197
Rym: it reminds me a lot of the in call.

701
00:42:34,498 --> 00:42:37,186
Scott: it reminds The fifth element.

702
00:42:37,467 --> 00:42:40,500
Rym: well the end call reminded me of the fifth element.

703
00:42:40,961 --> 00:42:45,835
Rym: So I think there's a circle of things that are all similar, but the end call.

704
00:42:45,995 --> 00:42:52,212
Rym: I liked it, but it was kind of One further step crazy and one further step comicky.

705
00:42:52,232 --> 00:42:54,780
Scott: Yeah, then cause a little hard to follow.

706
00:42:55,141 --> 00:42:56,767
Scott: Maybe some things are lost in translation.

707
00:42:56,807 --> 00:42:58,494
Scott: It didn't really fill in all the blanks.

708
00:42:58,554 --> 00:43:01,346
Scott: for you the pace is really rapid Yeah, but meanwhile saga.

709
00:43:01,587 --> 00:43:05,645
Rym: It's like it's one step closer to a movie much more Like.

710
00:43:05,665 --> 00:43:07,100
Rym: this could be a movie like that.

711
00:43:07,782 --> 00:43:12,639
Rym: Many TV miniseries easily the dialogue is is like TV dialogue straight up.

712
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,325
Scott: Yeah, so here's the.

713
00:43:14,385 --> 00:43:16,633
Scott: here's the general summary of what's going on in saga.

714
00:43:16,653 --> 00:43:16,874
Scott: right.

715
00:43:17,235 --> 00:43:25,709
Scott: so in this universe There was a race of people that lived on a moon and a race of people lived on a planet that the moon Orbited and they didn't like each other's.

716
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:28,500
Scott: they were fighting, but the fighting got so severe.

717
00:43:28,601 --> 00:43:34,080
Scott: They realized oh shit if we keep shooting at the moon and fuck it up We're gonna fuck ourselves because our moon will get fucked up.

718
00:43:34,501 --> 00:43:39,440
Scott: Realize well if you look at the planet we're fucking up ourselves on the moon, so they wanted to keep fighting.

719
00:43:39,781 --> 00:43:46,810
Scott: So they basically came up with this thing where we're gonna keep fighting each other because we still hate each other's guts Just not in our home world and home moon.

720
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:48,900
Scott: We're gonna take our battle to every else in the universe.

721
00:43:48,941 --> 00:43:59,850
Scott: They go to someone else's planet Force them to take sides and then make them fight and they basically go around fucking up the rest of the world by staging their Battles on other people's planets with the people know

722
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:06,180
Rym: it's interesting the the war is kind of at this point This is a one of those worlds where there's kind of like two sides.

723
00:44:06,401 --> 00:44:13,735
Rym: neither of one is good or evil and they're both sort of doing their job like the both sides kind of respect each other and have rules about when and how to fight.

724
00:44:13,756 --> 00:44:20,621
Rym: and As far as I can tell these two main characters and the peasantry are like the only people who see any problem with this Right.

725
00:44:20,982 --> 00:44:22,607
Scott: so of course you know the.

726
00:44:22,627 --> 00:44:23,309
Scott: what's the story?

727
00:44:23,349 --> 00:44:24,713
Scott: the story is Romeo and Juliet.

728
00:44:24,733 --> 00:44:26,578
Scott: you have one person from one side.

729
00:44:26,739 --> 00:44:34,683
Scott: if Juliet Was a consummate badass who's also really horny all the time and Romeo was a pussy you happen to have a sword But that's all he had.

730
00:44:35,044 --> 00:44:35,305
Rym: Oh, no.

731
00:44:35,365 --> 00:44:40,000
Rym: She's also really foul-mouthed, and I don't know their dialogue is really funny, right?

732
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:46,959
Scott: But anyway one person from the moon and one person from the earth part sort of sneak away decide They don't want to fight in this horrible war.

733
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:53,099
Scott: they were forced to fight in and fall in love and they go on an adventure trying to run away from danger.

734
00:44:53,119 --> 00:45:04,072
Scott: and You know at the same time there are people out to get them and the saga of them running away and traveling across Galaxies universes wherever they the distance is I don't know.

735
00:45:04,814 --> 00:45:05,998
Scott: and that's what saga is all about.

736
00:45:06,019 --> 00:45:07,384
Rym: yeah I don't want to say anymore.

737
00:45:07,525 --> 00:45:11,240
Rym: seriously if you're gonna read a comic like this right now saga is pretty great.

738
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,880
Scott: This is pretty much the hot comic on the shelves right now.

739
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:19,440
Rym: They are along with ponies is great and the thing is it throws you in media res and doesn't explain shit.

740
00:45:19,981 --> 00:45:26,264
Scott: That explanation I just gave you comes like later than the first issue At the very beginning.

741
00:45:26,285 --> 00:45:31,120
Rym: the very beginning is the two characters in that style of it reveals stuff like really quickly and all over the.

742
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:32,424
Scott: Yeah, I didn't spoil it right.

743
00:45:32,585 --> 00:45:33,910
Scott: I mean there's also some.

744
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:36,719
Rym: I think my favorite character is the will.

745
00:45:38,242 --> 00:45:39,086
Scott: Which one's that again?

746
00:45:39,147 --> 00:45:40,614
Rym: the the freelancer with the cat?

747
00:45:41,318 --> 00:45:41,680
Scott: Oh, okay?

748
00:45:41,741 --> 00:45:46,434
Scott: Well, okay, so my favorite character That's the thing this thing is all about and that's why I compared it to Fifth Element.

749
00:45:46,475 --> 00:45:49,046
Scott: the thing is all about Awesome characters.

750
00:45:49,126 --> 00:45:54,750
Scott: the main characters are awesome, but there's all these side characters I actually really like Prince robot - well, okay.

751
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:58,626
Scott: Yeah, Prince robot the bad guy totally reminds me He's not a bad guy.

752
00:45:58,666 --> 00:46:00,133
Scott: No, but I mean he's he's.

753
00:46:00,293 --> 00:46:01,840
Scott: you know quote the bad, right?

754
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:02,803
Scott: He's the adversary.

755
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:03,986
Rym: they make a point in this comic.

756
00:46:04,207 --> 00:46:06,614
Rym: It's like they call the war good versus good.

757
00:46:06,875 --> 00:46:07,276
Rym: Yeah.

758
00:46:07,677 --> 00:46:11,066
Scott: Yeah anyway He real his design of.

759
00:46:11,086 --> 00:46:14,238
Scott: you know the TV head kind of person really reminds me of the guy in.

760
00:46:15,426 --> 00:46:16,092
Scott: You know the one.

761
00:46:16,152 --> 00:46:19,350
Scott: what Galaxy Express In rice and rice boy.

762
00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:21,159
Rym: Oh, he reminds me of Count Mecca.

763
00:46:21,239 --> 00:46:22,725
Scott: anyway Yeah, he's he's that kind of guy.

764
00:46:22,745 --> 00:46:23,367
Scott: and then you've got.

765
00:46:23,588 --> 00:46:23,970
Scott: you got this.

766
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:26,700
Scott: basically the guy the will is basically Bruce Willis.

767
00:46:27,063 --> 00:46:29,000
Scott: Yeah from Fifth Element, right?

768
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,746
Rym: You've got there's one page.

769
00:46:31,786 --> 00:46:32,789
Rym: He makes this face.

770
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:35,378
Rym: He's basically Corbin Dallas where he is twitching.

771
00:46:35,478 --> 00:46:37,180
Scott: It's so great He has a pet cat.

772
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:40,108
Scott: That's the lying cat which is also incredibly awesome.

773
00:46:40,148 --> 00:46:47,100
Scott: where the cat makes the best faces to anyone is near it talking and you lie It'll say lying and it's always right.

774
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:51,040
Scott: So it's just a cat that can tell with 100% accuracy when someone is lying.

775
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:55,379
Rym: The cat also has a personality and while he or she doesn't talk all it says is the word lying.

776
00:46:55,419 --> 00:46:59,940
Rym: here She funny looks gives the will some looks and his name is the will.

777
00:47:00,127 --> 00:47:04,335
Scott: Yeah So there's another bounty hunter along with the will Scott really likes.

778
00:47:04,536 --> 00:47:05,660
Rym: that was an amazing cat.

779
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:10,720
Scott: The stock was amazing because they foreshadowed the stock where the will is like, oh the stocks on it.

780
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,351
Scott: I'm not even gonna bother I'm just gonna go get.

781
00:47:12,392 --> 00:47:13,560
Rym: I'm gonna go to the sex play.

782
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:16,239
Scott: I'm gonna go to the sex planet because the stock is taking care of it.

783
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:26,479
Scott: Oh my god, though that like when he's walking through the sex planet and you just see like the back It's like, you know All you know is there's another bounty hunter called the stock and the stock is so badass that the will is just like.

784
00:47:26,499 --> 00:47:29,115
Scott: well If the stock is on the job, I don't have nothing to do.

785
00:47:29,376 --> 00:47:30,020
Scott: fuck this shit.

786
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,420
Scott: And then later you see the stock and the stock is amazing.

787
00:47:33,101 --> 00:47:37,000
Scott: Then what other you know, you've got a ghost girl with no legs and oh, she's great.

788
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,729
Scott: That's spilling out amazing character who seems to write.

789
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:42,599
Scott: It's just every single character that shows up is amazing.

790
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:47,520
Scott: It's not even one of those situations like you're reading urasawa like 20th century boys, right?

791
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,820
Scott: And they'll introduce a character and immediately you don't care about them.

792
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:56,991
Scott: But then within three pages you care This is character appears and immediately the first frame they're in.

793
00:47:57,032 --> 00:48:02,988
Scott: you care about them because the design is amazing and you like Their existence was foreshadowed leaves a little bit to you.

794
00:48:03,029 --> 00:48:04,513
Scott: It's not like a surprise character.

795
00:48:04,553 --> 00:48:05,637
Scott: Like what's this person about?

796
00:48:05,697 --> 00:48:09,532
Scott: It's like oh Snap, they've just filled in a blank that was already set.

797
00:48:09,572 --> 00:48:11,118
Scott: they have you know, there's a half full glass.

798
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:16,440
Scott: now It's a full glass and that water looks so good, you know, so every character is awesome.

799
00:48:17,542 --> 00:48:25,315
Scott: I mean usually when you get into some sort of you know fictional story world material There's like the awesome character right like Star Wars Darth Vader.

800
00:48:25,335 --> 00:48:26,560
Rym: Here's a good example Game of Thrones.

801
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,209
Scott: Darth Vader is just better than everybody.

802
00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:32,427
Rym: most people agree like they like Game of Thrones Pretty much because of Sean Bean.

803
00:48:32,607 --> 00:48:33,711
Scott: is that the midget guy?

804
00:48:33,992 --> 00:48:35,817
Rym: No Tyrion the midget guy, right?

805
00:48:35,838 --> 00:48:36,580
Rym: Tyrion's the midget guy.

806
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:42,100
Rym: Whenever Sean Bean's in a movie, I just call him Sean Bean instead of calling him his character's name.

807
00:48:42,622 --> 00:48:46,276
Rym: But pretty much I really only want to see Tyrion in Game of Thrones.

808
00:48:46,296 --> 00:48:47,681
Rym: Whenever Tyrion's not on screen Right.

809
00:48:47,701 --> 00:48:48,604
Scott: So I was right.

810
00:48:48,664 --> 00:48:51,954
Scott: is that midget guy is the reason to watch right?

811
00:48:52,194 --> 00:48:59,197
Scott: So in saga, it's amazing because Everyone is the reason to read every single character is the reason to keep reading.

812
00:48:59,498 --> 00:49:01,727
Scott: and of course The first trade has an awesome cliffhanger.

813
00:49:01,747 --> 00:49:02,911
Scott: Of course.

814
00:49:03,011 --> 00:49:05,300
Scott: Yeah, I'll just get the second trade when it comes.

815
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:10,517
Scott: I did not expect like I turn that page and I didn't expect it, but then it made perfect sense.

816
00:49:10,878 --> 00:49:16,260
Scott: once it happened It's like oh, of course and and then you can see that totally sets up that ending.

817
00:49:16,581 --> 00:49:21,839
Scott: you know the structure of the story is gonna be for like the next whole trade at least right.

818
00:49:21,859 --> 00:49:31,353
Rym: and There's the dialogue and there's a certain level of sarcasm that pretty much everyone talks like normal people Just like in ponies and such.

819
00:49:31,999 --> 00:49:35,400
Rym: well No, they talk like normal people are in a movie where everyone is sarcastic.

820
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:38,167
Scott: Everyone in real life is okay.

821
00:49:39,051 --> 00:49:41,060
Rym: No, that's just cuz we live in New York and watch Seinfeld.

822
00:49:42,601 --> 00:49:46,507
Scott: Anyway, this is this is a must read comic SOG I mean the Star Wars.

823
00:49:46,547 --> 00:49:48,200
Rym: we're gonna talk about this again one.

824
00:49:48,341 --> 00:49:48,906
Rym: Yeah things done.

825
00:49:48,926 --> 00:49:51,986
Scott: if you're a huge Star Wars fan You should get the Star Wars comic.

826
00:49:52,087 --> 00:50:02,533
Scott: or if you just really like Star Wars and are looking for more and you're disappointed With you know or not having high hopes for the movie that's coming or who knows what right then, you know If you really need some Star Wars your Star Wars bucket is low.

827
00:50:02,794 --> 00:50:04,160
Scott: You can fill it with the Star Wars comic.

828
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,004
Scott: It's not necessary.

829
00:50:05,366 --> 00:50:07,999
Scott: saga is mandatory reading for all people.

830
00:50:08,504 --> 00:50:09,900
Scott: Period end of story.

831
00:50:10,081 --> 00:50:11,706
Rym: So apparently there's nerds.

832
00:50:11,766 --> 00:50:12,348
Scott: read saga.

833
00:50:12,428 --> 00:50:16,587
Rym: Brian cave on made a big deal about why he chose image over anyone else and I have a whole quote.

834
00:50:16,607 --> 00:50:19,363
Scott: the way that image Gives people money.

835
00:50:19,945 --> 00:50:20,767
Rym: It's a little more than that.

836
00:50:20,787 --> 00:50:24,016
Scott: It's also Chris Oh quotes and doesn't really tell you what to write.

837
00:50:24,036 --> 00:50:25,822
Rym: or yeah quote Brian Cave-on.

838
00:50:26,183 --> 00:50:27,348
Rym: I love all the other companies.

839
00:50:27,368 --> 00:50:32,992
Rym: I've worked with but I think image might be the only Publisher left that can still offer a contract.

840
00:50:33,073 --> 00:50:34,680
Rym: I would consider fully create around.

841
00:50:35,461 --> 00:50:52,619
Rym: Saga is a really important story to me and I wanted to guarantee of no content restrictions or other creative interference And I needed to maintain 100% control and ownership of all non publishing rights with the artist Including the right to never have our comic turned into a movie or television show or whatever.

842
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:56,558
Rym: And basically he's like image is the only publisher left.

843
00:50:57,263 --> 00:51:02,434
Scott: Yeah, if you if you're interested in this sort of thing I'm not gonna go into it now also because I forget a lot of the details.

844
00:51:02,875 --> 00:51:16,151
Scott: but basically the different Comic companies the way they make deals with the like Marvel will I you know DC they'll either give people a job Right as in like you are, you know exclusive to Marvel artists.

845
00:51:16,171 --> 00:51:19,180
Scott: You're on the salary, you know, we pay you whatever.

846
00:51:19,401 --> 00:51:23,320
Scott: I don't know if it's a page rate or what it right to draw what we tell you to draw, right?

847
00:51:24,644 --> 00:51:26,219
Scott: And there are some people with like freelancers.

848
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:30,219
Scott: They'll be like, hey, we'll pay you to draw the cover for this this month or something like that, right?

849
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:37,300
Scott: But every the other the independent comic companies, right and you know the big ones like, you know image and IDW, right?

850
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,266
Scott: They all they they.

851
00:51:39,306 --> 00:51:48,099
Scott: basically though the the way they make deals with the creators is Completely different and there's the way the image does is different from the way everyone else does it?

852
00:51:48,983 --> 00:51:51,064
Rym: Here's something great Total aside.

853
00:51:52,049 --> 00:51:58,199
Rym: in case the comic had not been successful He had a plan where at the end of issue 5 they would have died and that was the end of it.

854
00:51:58,546 --> 00:52:00,909
Rym: No, nice The rocket ship would have just explained there would die.

855
00:52:00,929 --> 00:52:01,552
Rym: that would have been the end.

856
00:52:01,572 --> 00:52:03,240
Scott: like great for telling about the rocket ship.

857
00:52:03,501 --> 00:52:05,427
Rym: The rocket ship is foreshadowed in the beginning.

858
00:52:05,467 --> 00:52:06,811
Scott: The rocket ship is made of a tree.

859
00:52:06,831 --> 00:52:09,440
Rym: It's so awesome some Hyperion going on in there.

860
00:52:09,851 --> 00:52:11,319
Scott: Oh shit I didn't even think of that.

861
00:52:11,861 --> 00:52:13,146
Rym: But sad news to.

862
00:52:13,206 --> 00:52:16,416
Rym: Vaughn basically said I never want this to be on TV or in a movie theater.

863
00:52:16,576 --> 00:52:17,359
Rym: ever ever ever.

864
00:52:17,399 --> 00:52:18,222
Rym: it won't Happen.

865
00:52:18,342 --> 00:52:26,780
Scott: that's kind of actually good in a way in that maybe people who really want to read it want to read the comic True, but at the same time it would make a great movie.

866
00:52:26,861 --> 00:52:30,545
Scott: But on the other hand the production cost would be so high It would have to.

867
00:52:30,626 --> 00:52:31,049
Rym: it would be.

868
00:52:31,149 --> 00:52:32,779
Scott: it costs a lot of money to make this.

869
00:52:33,002 --> 00:52:34,540
Rym: I know it would to make it right.

870
00:52:34,701 --> 00:52:38,700
Scott: Yeah, all the costumes and special effects, you know, I had to be off the chain.

871
00:52:38,901 --> 00:52:42,859
Rym: But I would I would put a lot of money out of that chain to have that chain come off.

872
00:52:43,362 --> 00:52:44,851
Scott: Oh, I'm fine with the green.

873
00:52:44,871 --> 00:52:46,239
Scott: the comic is also about the comics.

874
00:52:46,259 --> 00:52:49,836
Scott: great What do I need it to be, you know, it's like Oh bakkemon turned into an anime.

875
00:52:49,876 --> 00:52:50,700
Scott: That's the same thing.

876
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,890
Rym: I like how the world mostly doesn't say much just walks around smoking that joint.

877
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:57,617
Rym: Yeah Yeah.

878
00:52:57,921 --> 00:53:03,716
Rym: Also the will Bruce Willis, I think that's intention is intentional.

879
00:53:03,756 --> 00:53:05,360
Scott: Oh my god, that's true.

880
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:12,199
Rym: When they introduced him as the will and then they show him sit that one page where he's sitting and he just got the call.

881
00:53:12,641 --> 00:53:13,788
Scott: You know, we've been talking about the will.

882
00:53:13,868 --> 00:53:14,814
Scott: more than any other character.

883
00:53:14,854 --> 00:53:23,632
Rym: the will is not the main character he's a side character because he is the best character except the cat and I Can't even say the other character.

884
00:53:23,652 --> 00:53:25,623
Rym: all awesome Everyone's awesome.

885
00:53:25,663 --> 00:53:31,990
Rym: Even this stock is even the secret agent guy in the beginning who goes to the robot prince and is like Here's your mission.

886
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:32,536
Scott: No the pussy.

887
00:53:36,602 --> 00:53:38,040
Rym: Okay, this is it's a good comic.
