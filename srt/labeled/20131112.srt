1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,250
Rym: It's Tuesday November 12th 2013.

2
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:16,200
Rym: I'm Rym and this is GeekNights tonight games of the yard.

3
00:00:19,242 --> 00:00:20,278
Rym: Let's do this.

4
00:00:24,751 --> 00:00:26,355
Rym: So yeah finally got Google Glass.

5
00:00:26,615 --> 00:00:27,899
Scott: It's uh join the club.

6
00:00:27,999 --> 00:00:38,906
Rym: it is Exactly what I expected because unlike a lot of people out there I had perfectly reasonable expectations based on my own research, okay I knew what it would be like.

7
00:00:39,448 --> 00:00:51,177
Rym: it's about what I expected and the only interesting thing I can really say about it is that I'm finding I Don't know I feel like I got used to it really quickly and as a result whenever.

8
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:51,960
Rym: I'm not wearing it.

9
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:56,139
Rym: I periodically already kind of every now and then look up and then nothing happens.

10
00:00:56,742 --> 00:01:00,420
Scott: Well I mean for you right you're already a glasses.

11
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,042
Scott: That's the thing.

12
00:01:01,122 --> 00:01:05,656
Rym: I already wear glasses so wearing Google Glass has no physical disruption in my life.

13
00:01:05,696 --> 00:01:07,999
Rym: wearing them and not wearing them is the same.

14
00:01:09,022 --> 00:01:11,050
Rym: So I don't notice a physical presence, so I don't.

15
00:01:11,633 --> 00:01:16,460
Rym: unless I think or pay attention I won't really know if I'm wearing glass or not.

16
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,932
Rym: I just kind of always assume that screen is there and then occasionally it's not there because I'm not wearing the glass of wearing my other glasses.

17
00:01:23,361 --> 00:01:32,704
Rym: But I did a lot of research and while I can get the prescription Semi, maybe or maybe not official Setup sometime next year.

18
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:34,109
Rym: I ain't waiting.

19
00:01:34,129 --> 00:01:41,051
Rym: so I found an optician who is willing to make me custom Prescription lenses that will clip in the same way.

20
00:01:41,111 --> 00:01:42,136
Scott: that I'm so rich.

21
00:01:42,518 --> 00:01:44,712
Scott: look at me I'm so rich, so here's the deal.

22
00:01:44,752 --> 00:01:45,477
Scott: it money money.

23
00:01:45,517 --> 00:01:46,783
Rym: You know Scott I were talking about this.

24
00:01:47,887 --> 00:01:58,460
Rym: all the things that aren't made by Google that are related to glass Seem to be things that are aimed at people with a lot of disposable income perhaps due to the overlap of demographics.

25
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:05,820
Scott: Well, I mean when you have a luxury item the accessories market for it is gonna be other luxury targeted things, right?

26
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,878
Scott: It's like if you're selling Ferrari accessories, you're not selling cup holders.

27
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,782
Scott: Okay Right.

28
00:02:12,982 --> 00:02:14,747
Scott: so for glass is the same thing.

29
00:02:14,807 --> 00:02:22,231
Scott: because glass is a high ticket luxury item all the accessories and apps for it are also a high ticket Targeted tour.

30
00:02:22,272 --> 00:02:27,473
Rym: Here's the thing Are several hundred dollars anyway at minimum.

31
00:02:28,075 --> 00:02:34,301
Rym: so getting custom Lenses with a custom mount bespoke lenses Yeah, you know well You know.

32
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:38,293
Rym: as an aside I used the word bespoke at work in reference to some.

33
00:02:38,313 --> 00:02:41,984
Rym: I was making a joke and I was always Say here's an artisanal character sheet.

34
00:02:42,466 --> 00:02:45,715
Rym: I was like here's a bespoke alert rule template for one of our products.

35
00:02:45,735 --> 00:02:46,277
Scott: What about a?

36
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,042
Scott: Is it hot?

37
00:02:48,062 --> 00:02:48,583
Scott: go to her?

38
00:02:48,623 --> 00:02:49,385
Scott: How do you pronounce it?

39
00:02:49,405 --> 00:02:55,554
Rym: So every everyone involved in this conversation with one exception was like bespoke What?

40
00:02:57,283 --> 00:03:00,259
Rym: But then the one person who knew that term was left.

41
00:03:00,982 --> 00:03:05,857
Rym: He laughed and then explained it to everybody and then he was like really only a hair.

42
00:03:05,897 --> 00:03:11,908
Rym: it used in reference to designer custom clothing Not other things.

43
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:25,199
Rym: but then he pointed something out interesting that He's noticed that tech people have been using the term a lot in reference to technology over the last few years And that's a recent trend in his mind and his experience.

44
00:03:25,219 --> 00:03:30,680
Rym: and I will admit that my first encounter with that word was a glove.

45
00:03:31,721 --> 00:03:36,654
Scott: My first encounter with that word was some hipster place and then yeah for me.

46
00:03:36,694 --> 00:03:37,677
Rym: It was bespoke Fox.

47
00:03:38,358 --> 00:03:40,760
Scott: No, right Yeah, I knew what the word meant when I read that comment.

48
00:03:41,902 --> 00:03:44,740
Rym: Well, I was able to assume from context what the word meant.

49
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:48,340
Rym: So I hint all you kids out there, especially your younger kids, you know how to read.

50
00:03:48,701 --> 00:03:50,509
Rym: Yeah, really you can.

51
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:51,955
Scott: you are your literate.

52
00:03:52,718 --> 00:03:53,381
Rym: I don't know I've.

53
00:03:53,862 --> 00:03:58,794
Rym: I've run into a problem lately in my interactions with younger listeners.

54
00:03:59,034 --> 00:03:59,696
Scott: They're young.

55
00:03:59,716 --> 00:04:05,273
Rym: They're not literate, but though You can figure out the gist of what a word means not.

56
00:04:05,293 --> 00:04:09,449
Rym: if you're not literate guys Guys, it's not that hard.

57
00:04:09,469 --> 00:04:10,977
Scott: You're illiterate then you can't.

58
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:11,580
Rym: that's I mean.

59
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,470
Rym: Maybe I say that my has too much spleen.

60
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:17,240
Rym: then maybe maybe there's some trouble with that context.

61
00:04:18,243 --> 00:04:19,447
Rym: But yeah, I like Google Glass.

62
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:33,645
Rym: I rigged up a sort of custom prescription lens in the meantime that It works fine Except it looks like the kind of glasses that an unfashionable dad from the early 80s would wear Like these insert.

63
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:35,813
Rym: these lenses are not designed for humans to see.

64
00:04:35,853 --> 00:04:37,860
Rym: they're supposed to be inside of my ski goggles.

65
00:04:38,163 --> 00:04:41,221
Scott: They're not for humans to see they're for dolphins Doll.

66
00:04:41,282 --> 00:04:45,092
Rym: why would a dolphin see them skiing goggles?

67
00:04:45,132 --> 00:04:50,034
Scott: you'd imagine if you're a fucking near-sighted dolphin you think like Oh, man, that shark is way far away.

68
00:04:50,074 --> 00:04:50,738
Scott: I'm sure I'm cool.

69
00:04:52,222 --> 00:04:54,400
Scott: That's all the ones that are get caught in all the nets of the fishermen.

70
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:54,922
Scott: Maybe that.

71
00:04:54,982 --> 00:04:58,452
Rym: but near-sightedness doesn't mean things look further away than they are.

72
00:04:58,853 --> 00:05:01,100
Scott: In fact, things are more means you can't see shit.

73
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,804
Scott: That's far away.

74
00:05:01,824 --> 00:05:02,025
Rym: Yes.

75
00:05:02,085 --> 00:05:03,090
Rym: It means the further what you're.

76
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,055
Scott: I'm safe here.

77
00:05:04,075 --> 00:05:04,900
Scott: There's no sharks around.

78
00:05:05,181 --> 00:05:09,293
Rym: Your focal point is actually close so you can focus on things that are.

79
00:05:09,374 --> 00:05:11,300
Scott: you can see Google Glass itself.

80
00:05:11,664 --> 00:05:12,600
Scott: You just can't see them.

81
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:16,359
Rym: So here's how bad my vision is also because of the way they project the glass image.

82
00:05:16,921 --> 00:05:23,780
Rym: Because though it's interesting the first thing everyone asked me was not the dumb questions you get but the question was always the same question.

83
00:05:24,342 --> 00:05:25,766
Rym: So where is the screen?

84
00:05:25,786 --> 00:05:26,629
Scott: who's asking you this?

85
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:28,836
Scott: people on the street or people that you already knew?

86
00:05:28,997 --> 00:05:29,900
Rym: one person in the subway?

87
00:05:30,761 --> 00:05:32,265
Scott: No one ever asked me that question ever.

88
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:39,419
Rym: one person who I was playing ingress and then the guy was also playing ingress and he Was like yo dog got Google Glass.

89
00:05:40,221 --> 00:05:41,646
Rym: Where's the screen that you show?

90
00:05:41,667 --> 00:05:42,189
Rym: Where's the screen?

91
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:42,550
Rym: show up?

92
00:05:42,671 --> 00:05:44,558
Scott: that should give you some I don't know.

93
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:47,083
Rym: It's hard That's right there.

94
00:05:47,203 --> 00:05:52,129
Scott: That's also sort of a dumb question because it's like Where else it's?

95
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:52,835
Scott: on my left where?

96
00:05:54,521 --> 00:06:00,600
Rym: Like people don't know like most people still think it's a heads-up display and Google is not Disavowed normal people of that notion.

97
00:06:01,481 --> 00:06:04,631
Scott: Yeah, it's like you have a little rectangle TV in the corner.

98
00:06:04,652 --> 00:06:04,772
Scott: Yep.

99
00:06:04,812 --> 00:06:10,460
Rym: It's about like a hand like put your hand out as Far as your arm will reach in front of you and then twist your palms.

100
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,667
Rym: So your palm is facing you.

101
00:06:11,687 --> 00:06:13,780
Rym: it's about there and about that bit.

102
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,432
Scott: It's like there's a see-through TV just sort of floating around.

103
00:06:16,954 --> 00:06:25,120
Rym: Yep in the top right corner but if I don't have the prescription glass in I Can't see the Google Glass screen.

104
00:06:25,321 --> 00:06:26,063
Rym: It's out of focus.

105
00:06:26,103 --> 00:06:31,899
Scott: if I ever had to compete at you with anything and the stakes are not low as they usually are You're gonna knock my glasses.

106
00:06:32,902 --> 00:06:39,148
Rym: Yeah, you know what if I'm ever competing you and with you and something where the stakes are Sufficiently not low?

107
00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:45,932
Rym: one of the growing in the ball - because you won't see it coming - I'm not wearing Google Glass.

108
00:06:46,032 --> 00:06:47,939
Rym: I'm wearing like my ski goggles.

109
00:06:50,324 --> 00:06:53,536
Rym: If we're having some sort of Locke Lamora contest then all bets are off.

110
00:06:53,717 --> 00:06:54,259
Scott: I was stabbing.

111
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,429
Scott: I guess You don't have any stab armor.

112
00:06:57,493 --> 00:06:57,815
Rym: I could.

113
00:06:57,855 --> 00:07:02,209
Rym: I just saw an ad Randomly for a stab and bulletproof suit.

114
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:02,951
Rym: Spoke.

115
00:07:03,372 --> 00:07:04,314
Scott: Maybe I'll do the.

116
00:07:04,615 --> 00:07:06,299
Scott: who is the guy from Australia Kelly?

117
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,848
Scott: Ned Kelly, that's my new strategy.

118
00:07:08,868 --> 00:07:13,831
Scott: Ned Kelly aka the world's first weeaboo Armor plus guns can't lose.

119
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:17,818
Scott: Well did lose Six year dudes.

120
00:07:19,162 --> 00:07:34,535
Rym: So the only other thing I'll say about glass now and we'll talk about it later once You know write apps and play with it and we've talked about it before is this It is worth the price of admission as is if they never add anything to it just for the turn-by-turn GPS enabled bike navigation,

121
00:07:34,575 --> 00:07:35,199
Scott: but I don't have that.

122
00:07:36,101 --> 00:07:37,551
Rym: Yeah, I cannot like.

123
00:07:37,712 --> 00:07:39,000
Rym: I expected it to be okay.

124
00:07:39,281 --> 00:07:39,803
Rym: So what I did?

125
00:07:39,883 --> 00:07:41,349
Rym: the first thing I did I took glass.

126
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:43,136
Rym: I walked out of Chelsea market.

127
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:52,041
Rym: after I was all done in there I got on a city bike and I said Google glass navigate whatever and I told it to navigate me somewhere specific and far away In a neighborhood.

128
00:07:52,061 --> 00:07:58,538
Rym: I didn't know and then I just biked there and the directions were so perfect and so easy to use.

129
00:07:58,558 --> 00:08:08,359
Rym: I Cannot express to you how much I love having that there and I can't wait to drive with those navigations in my eye Mmm, and the battery runs out in the middle of the drive.

130
00:08:08,861 --> 00:08:10,446
Rym: Yeah, so I already experimented with that.

131
00:08:10,928 --> 00:08:14,840
Rym: the using the navigation does not seem to diminish the battery life at all.

132
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,787
Scott: Well, that's because the phone is doing most of the work.

133
00:08:16,807 --> 00:08:19,960
Scott: Yes, and your phone battery dies already driving.

134
00:08:20,141 --> 00:08:23,714
Rym: So so the phone the the screen only turns on when it turns coming.

135
00:08:23,734 --> 00:08:23,895
Scott: Yeah.

136
00:08:23,975 --> 00:08:24,557
Scott: I know I have it.

137
00:08:24,698 --> 00:08:27,068
Rym: Yeah But you haven't used the navigation.

138
00:08:27,489 --> 00:08:29,860
Scott: No, but I know that the screen old turns on hardly ever.

139
00:08:30,101 --> 00:08:39,500
Rym: yeah, but the screen turns on every time there's a turn coming up or there's anything weird coming up and It also plays a little tone and tells you through that awesome transducer speaker that works perfectly.

140
00:08:41,042 --> 00:08:41,563
Scott: Mine doesn't work.

141
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:41,846
Scott: Perfect.

142
00:08:41,905 --> 00:08:42,690
Rym: I know mine does.

143
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,520
Rym: I don't know if there's anybody upgraded it mine.

144
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:49,600
Scott: Basically if it beeps and if someone calls me on the phone it tries to use it to be like for the phone call.

145
00:08:50,182 --> 00:08:54,219
Rym: But then it just sounds like see I got the cool little earbud you can stick in.

146
00:08:54,259 --> 00:08:56,225
Scott: now They're gonna make stereo earbuds.

147
00:08:56,426 --> 00:09:00,860
Scott: Yeah, they are is gonna be good because then it's like oh, I finally have Bluetooth headphones.

148
00:09:01,363 --> 00:09:03,256
Scott: Okay, I was one of those no wires.

149
00:09:03,619 --> 00:09:05,765
Rym: Yep But yeah, we'll see.

150
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:10,323
Rym: I like Google s a lot and I'm gonna try to write an app for it at some point in the Next month.

151
00:09:10,805 --> 00:09:11,748
Scott: you will not succeed.

152
00:09:11,908 --> 00:09:14,516
Rym: The mirror API is so easy to use.

153
00:09:14,716 --> 00:09:15,740
Scott: That's the web API.

154
00:09:16,143 --> 00:09:17,419
Scott: You can't really do much with it.

155
00:09:17,661 --> 00:09:22,420
Rym: I know I'm not going to try to write anything real yet because I don't want to go down the road of Android development.

156
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:28,100
Rym: I'm gonna use the mirror API and make something dumb and useful and assume that I'll have internet when I would use that thing.

157
00:09:33,123 --> 00:09:39,385
Scott: Mm-hmm Yeah, my computer just all messed up like anyway What you do.

158
00:09:39,425 --> 00:09:42,315
Scott: it is Tuesday, I guess Explorer crashed or some shit.

159
00:09:42,355 --> 00:09:43,519
Scott: Anyway, I know my news is so.

160
00:09:44,761 --> 00:09:45,645
Scott: It's gaming day.

161
00:09:45,806 --> 00:09:46,388
Scott: It's Tuesday.

162
00:09:46,428 --> 00:09:47,673
Scott: Maybe we should actually talk about that.

163
00:09:47,693 --> 00:09:48,979
Rym: All right game time, right?

164
00:09:50,343 --> 00:09:52,739
Scott: One of the games that we don't really like is pandemic.

165
00:09:53,964 --> 00:10:04,140
Rym: In fact, we have lectured in multiple unrelated lectures in a section about how much we hate pandemic and how we think it's a bad game from Almost every bad game.

166
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:11,870
Scott: So they're coming out with pandemic the dice game and this seems to be happening a lot lately where you have a game and then They come out with like the same game again.

167
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:15,563
Scott: So like Tigris and Euphrates the card game or What are?

168
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:18,842
Scott: there's a lot of them that have card games and one Right.

169
00:10:18,882 --> 00:10:22,160
Scott: There's like you have a big game and you make some other version of us to make pen.

170
00:10:22,241 --> 00:10:22,887
Scott: They're coming out.

171
00:10:23,028 --> 00:10:27,140
Rym: I think next year with pandemic There's that there is the dice monopoly that came out way back in the day, right?

172
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:31,580
Scott: They're coming out with pandemic the dice game and I predict it's gonna be bad.

173
00:10:31,701 --> 00:10:37,560
Scott: I read the description of it and Basically, it sounds nearly identical to pandemic.

174
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,314
Scott: So every problem that pandemic has this game also has.

175
00:10:40,374 --> 00:10:42,203
Scott: the only difference is All right.

176
00:10:42,263 --> 00:10:45,436
Scott: that from what I can tell based on a description and not reading the rulebook.

177
00:10:45,456 --> 00:10:46,260
Scott: So this isn't final.

178
00:10:46,641 --> 00:10:49,189
Rym: Well, I'm basing my opinion based on literally nothing.

179
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:49,710
Rym: So go on.

180
00:10:49,730 --> 00:11:06,639
Scott: right is that it's identical to pandemic but Instead of that deck that reveals like where shit appears right your old ice and Each player right the different rolls has different dice and on your turn you roll your dice and whatever they come up.

181
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,767
Scott: Those are the actions that you can take.

182
00:11:08,807 --> 00:11:11,980
Scott: instead of being able to take, you know, any combinations of actions.

183
00:11:12,461 --> 00:11:14,167
Scott: You're more limited by luck.

184
00:11:14,267 --> 00:11:15,471
Scott: right because you roll these dice.

185
00:11:15,551 --> 00:11:17,236
Rym: I assume you can yah see the dice.

186
00:11:17,618 --> 00:11:18,380
Scott: I don't know it didn't?

187
00:11:20,561 --> 00:11:21,665
Rym: You can't yah see the dice.

188
00:11:21,826 --> 00:11:23,893
Rym: fucked up guys who knows.

189
00:11:23,973 --> 00:11:27,726
Scott: but it's the point is is that it's a You know, it's a it.

190
00:11:27,826 --> 00:11:32,020
Scott: otherwise it seems clearly identical to pandemic based on the rules that were described.

191
00:11:32,903 --> 00:11:35,350
Rym: I was burned by this a lot of like I remember.

192
00:11:35,371 --> 00:11:37,818
Rym: so why it's like this new Frades card game?

193
00:11:37,858 --> 00:11:43,884
Rym: just It shared these superficial similarities, but was just kind of bad Right.

194
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:51,927
Scott: So the reason this is weird to me is because usually when they make these You know other versions of games like something something the card game or something something the dice game.

195
00:11:51,987 --> 00:12:04,190
Scott: right that new version of it Bears some mechanical similarity But is usually highly simplified and shortened and more portable and has these other features that you know.

196
00:12:04,531 --> 00:12:08,350
Scott: It's like yeah, you can't bust out T&E right now, but you can bust out this card game, right?

197
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:13,458
Scott: this seems Like it's not less than pandemic.

198
00:12:13,478 --> 00:12:17,430
Scott: It doesn't seem to take less time or play faster at least based on the description.

199
00:12:18,093 --> 00:12:19,922
Scott: So why it's like they're just trying to.

200
00:12:20,123 --> 00:12:21,610
Scott: it's like why would you play this instead?

201
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:22,795
Rym: Well, you know what it does do.

202
00:12:22,835 --> 00:12:27,878
Rym: it removes the need for a big board and abstracts it Completely sure.

203
00:12:27,938 --> 00:12:29,330
Rym: You just have a little circle disc.

204
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:35,633
Rym: It looks like for each continent and then you put dice that you've expanded or used or whatever on those Continents.

205
00:12:35,773 --> 00:12:40,228
Rym: Yeah, and there's a little circle track that looks like a cribbage bridge score track.

206
00:12:40,368 --> 00:12:43,390
Rym: Yep Yeah, I'm gonna assume this is bad.

207
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:47,910
Scott: Also the picture the dice look like it doesn't seem like it actually solves any of the problems of pandemic.

208
00:12:48,953 --> 00:12:57,530
Rym: I would argue that for the people who like pandemic and for the people who make pandemic None of those things are problems because they like the game.

209
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:03,327
Scott: I really wish there was some data collection on board game playing because I get the feeling right.

210
00:13:03,347 --> 00:13:07,384
Scott: you look at something like Pandemic and it's hugely popular.

211
00:13:07,424 --> 00:13:08,391
Scott: It sells really well Like

212
00:13:08,431 --> 00:13:09,455
Rym: I go to a convention and

213
00:13:09,696 --> 00:13:09,978
Scott: and there

214
00:13:10,098 --> 00:13:14,674
Rym: are fourth at the tables are playing some very much Right,

215
00:13:14,855 --> 00:13:26,270
Scott: there are people clearly they exist who are into it right like they are, you know they're playing a lot of munchkin or They are playing a whole lot of pandemic and that's their thing and they're into it.

216
00:13:26,551 --> 00:13:38,950
Scott: But I get the feeling that maybe a lot of people like they play it a few times and they're right Some sort of churn right and then they're not into it, but maybe they'll play a few games sometime later, right?

217
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:40,757
Scott: But they they're into it then they're not into it.

218
00:13:41,118 --> 00:13:47,563
Scott: and then another wave and it's like a wave that passes over The community and at any time at any given moment.

219
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:50,777
Scott: the hump of the wave is large Which is why the game is popular.

220
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:54,335
Scott: because you know, it can it can it spreads almost like a you know A fractal kind of.

221
00:13:54,355 --> 00:13:56,770
Scott: however, the hump is big like a pebble falling into the water.

222
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,472
Scott: It spreads.

223
00:13:57,713 --> 00:14:03,930
Rym: the hump is big enough that it would imply a but the middle of the ingress of people getting into board games.

224
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:12,410
Scott: Well, you know, even if it's not people getting into board gaming It's you play the game and then you play the game with new friends and then you play the game with right?

225
00:14:13,091 --> 00:14:14,737
Scott: Ah, and I think that's what if you think about.

226
00:14:14,757 --> 00:14:24,095
Scott: if you think about a circle, right the radius keeps increasing But the only players are the people who are around the edge of the circle and the middle of the circle isn't really playing The game very much at all.

227
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:26,284
Scott: So I wonder that's what I think it might be.

228
00:14:26,364 --> 00:14:27,790
Rym: I think there's there's a two-step going on.

229
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:28,397
Rym: I think you're right.

230
00:14:28,437 --> 00:14:29,529
Rym: I never considered that angle.

231
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,689
Rym: So I think there is a huge churn through games like pandemic.

232
00:14:33,071 --> 00:14:41,482
Rym: But - I think there's a there's one other factor because there are other games that people churn through that you don't see Around like you see pandemic.

233
00:14:42,145 --> 00:14:43,030
Scott: Well, there's less vibe.

234
00:14:43,411 --> 00:14:47,403
Rym: I think the less popular is actually just a. I think they're.

235
00:14:47,483 --> 00:14:57,243
Rym: you know, there's some kinds of people who play a game Eventually figure it out enough to where it's not fun anymore and other than teaching or occasionally Like I'll play settlers once they come every few years.

236
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:58,409
Rym: They don't play it anymore.

237
00:14:59,172 --> 00:15:09,049
Rym: But there's some people and I think they're a good like quarter or third of board gamers Who I don't think they have the capacity to get bored with a game that they like.

238
00:15:09,511 --> 00:15:12,283
Rym: No, like they but they never get good at the game.

239
00:15:12,303 --> 00:15:26,050
Rym: They're like the scrubs in the fighting Culture like fighting game culture the people who never really get good enough to be good But never are bad enough to not have fun and they enjoy playing the game and constantly play it and never improve themselves.

240
00:15:26,252 --> 00:15:30,436
Scott: There are people who come to play netrunner Every single tournament, right?

241
00:15:30,516 --> 00:15:31,660
Scott: They just they're at the bottom.

242
00:15:31,981 --> 00:15:33,626
Scott: They've been playing as long as I have.

243
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:41,510
Scott: they keep showing up They keep playing they keep buying cards and they still at the bottom of the tournament every time I don't win.

244
00:15:41,811 --> 00:15:53,485
Scott: I came in second once but I you know, I started like middle-ish and now I'm sort of higher middle-ish and I'm moving up slowly very slowly You know, so that sure, you know, it's like I'm getting better at it.

245
00:15:53,767 --> 00:16:09,739
Rym: There are gods I can't assail and so so my other thing is I think there's a pretty high overlap between the kinds of people who like pandemic and the kinds of people who like all those house on Haunted Hill Arkham whatever kinds of games obviously.

246
00:16:09,819 --> 00:16:24,037
Rym: and I think those core people who never get tired of these games or Don't play them enough on a regular basis to get to the point where they'd be tired of them are the ones maintaining this core That draws the churn in.

247
00:16:24,398 --> 00:16:27,890
Rym: they're the guys who are at the gaming club and they're there every week playing pandemic.

248
00:16:28,211 --> 00:16:31,605
Rym: So every week one of the new people who shows up plays pandemic once with them.

249
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:32,026
Rym: Mm-hmm.

250
00:16:33,332 --> 00:16:38,414
Rym: So speaking of another game you guys might remember candy box Candy box - is that?

251
00:16:38,454 --> 00:16:38,635
Scott: yep.

252
00:16:38,735 --> 00:16:41,926
Scott: I played candy box - I only play candy bags - a tiny bit.

253
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:46,642
Rym: it had some more Game mechanic mechanics in it a whole lot more.

254
00:16:46,762 --> 00:16:48,889
Rym: Yeah, there's a lot to do and it was pretty fun.

255
00:16:49,431 --> 00:16:50,937
Rym: But then I cheated.

256
00:16:51,339 --> 00:16:53,969
Scott: cheating was slightly more difficult to do than in candy box.

257
00:16:53,989 --> 00:16:56,938
Rym: Yeah I tried to give myself just a infinite candy and that worked.

258
00:16:56,978 --> 00:17:01,069
Rym: but then spending that candy didn't actually work because I messed something up.

259
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:03,297
Rym: But I digress candy box one.

260
00:17:03,337 --> 00:17:03,980
Rym: I didn't cheat.

261
00:17:04,261 --> 00:17:06,769
Rym: I just beat it by waiting a few days and then playing the game.

262
00:17:08,672 --> 00:17:15,595
Rym: But there's another form of candy box known as all those games on the 3ds that just make you wait for people and then Turn those people through.

263
00:17:15,694 --> 00:17:16,397
Rym: nothing games.

264
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:16,858
Scott: Yep.

265
00:17:17,241 --> 00:17:19,569
Scott: Well, the one the one game is not a nothing.

266
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:21,656
Rym: What game is a not a nothing game?

267
00:17:21,696 --> 00:17:23,743
Scott: The shmup is not a nothing game thought.

268
00:17:24,185 --> 00:17:30,043
Rym: All right, that is Exactly one planks hair width above a nothing game.

269
00:17:30,103 --> 00:17:30,685
Scott: It's a shmup.

270
00:17:31,267 --> 00:17:32,110
Scott: It's a legit shmup.

271
00:17:32,371 --> 00:17:35,210
Rym: It's not terribly legit not fucking Ikaruga.

272
00:17:35,832 --> 00:17:42,330
Rym: So is there any reason to play that shmup over say an emulated copy of Galaga on your phone?

273
00:17:44,832 --> 00:17:46,930
Rym: Other than for the candy box purposes?

274
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:49,240
Rym: Captain candy pants.

275
00:17:49,724 --> 00:17:52,638
Scott: It's more of a great I'd say it's more of a gradius than a Galaga.

276
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:59,369
Rym: I picture Scott saying this from inside of a candy box more of a great stomach exposed and gorged on candies.

277
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:05,350
Rym: So there is another candy box game that many of you are not playing and I played it a whole bunch.

278
00:18:05,732 --> 00:18:06,878
Rym: So I'd be able to talk about it.

279
00:18:07,301 --> 00:18:07,803
Rym: ingress.

280
00:18:08,206 --> 00:18:08,990
Scott: Oh not cookie clicker.

281
00:18:09,852 --> 00:18:12,390
Scott: Fuck cookie clicker the ultimate in candy box.

282
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:16,189
Scott: In fact, the guy who made cookie clicker specifically said he was inspired by candy box.

283
00:18:17,053 --> 00:18:18,781
Rym: Ah, I guess it is in the same class.

284
00:18:18,941 --> 00:18:19,805
Scott: It is getting by.

285
00:18:19,885 --> 00:18:24,445
Rym: so ingress I would say is it by Niantic Labs, which is really Google.

286
00:18:24,747 --> 00:18:25,450
Rym: It's like through Google.

287
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:29,845
Scott: I was surprised this thing took off because usually when Google makes shit like this it just bombs.

288
00:18:30,126 --> 00:18:42,156
Rym: So from what I've read Google gave them unprecedented latitude to do whatever the fuck when they made this game and as a result, they made the game kind of however they wanted let them stick with it.

289
00:18:42,256 --> 00:18:43,038
Scott: even after failing.

290
00:18:43,058 --> 00:18:43,839
Scott: they just kept trying.

291
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:56,590
Rym: so I Got into the early early beta and proceeded to not play the game at all Because my old Samsung Nexus s was not fast enough to render the effects and I couldn't fucking play.

292
00:18:57,392 --> 00:19:03,049
Rym: Like if I wasn't way out in furthest Queens the game would work, but there's like one portal out there.

293
00:19:03,149 --> 00:19:05,589
Rym: great But then it was when I was in Manhattan.

294
00:19:06,297 --> 00:19:09,670
Rym: portal density is subject to population density.

295
00:19:10,293 --> 00:19:13,930
Rym: So there's like a hundred portals that I can see at any one time and my phone just couldn't deal with it.

296
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:18,966
Rym: So I didn't play until I got my new Nexus 4 and then suddenly I could play.

297
00:19:18,986 --> 00:19:19,487
Rym: so I played.

298
00:19:19,508 --> 00:19:24,604
Rym: I leveled up It's candy box, of course, and it's surprisingly popular.

299
00:19:24,624 --> 00:19:29,109
Rym: It seems to be most popular among College kids like people who are in college.

300
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:33,022
Scott: Yeah, cuz that's where you have a density of people savvy enough to play the game.

301
00:19:33,102 --> 00:19:33,764
Scott: also cities.

302
00:19:34,085 --> 00:19:35,430
Scott: You can't play this game in the burbs?

303
00:19:36,471 --> 00:19:39,030
Rym: Well, you can but then you know, it's funny cuz in the burbs.

304
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:46,447
Scott: But if you're if you're a kid in the burbs and you've got a Android phone and you're playing this game Okay, so you can make portals at school and portals.

305
00:19:46,488 --> 00:19:46,970
Scott: at your house.

306
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:49,989
Scott: It may be a portal like at the place you get piano lessons.

307
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:52,444
Rym: And so here's the way the game works if you played it at all.

308
00:19:52,464 --> 00:19:53,410
Rym: Do you have any idea how it works?

309
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:54,357
Scott: I don't have an Android phone.

310
00:19:54,822 --> 00:19:57,502
Rym: All right I have a bunch of invites to.

311
00:19:57,522 --> 00:19:58,310
Rym: if any of you guys want them.

312
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:02,250
Rym: I just keep getting them and ever use them because everyone I know who wants to play the game has an iPhone.

313
00:20:02,491 --> 00:20:05,690
Rym: So the way the game works is there's an overlay of the world.

314
00:20:06,355 --> 00:20:10,596
Rym: Magic dust is falling from the sky Landing all over golden compass style.

315
00:20:11,138 --> 00:20:15,850
Rym: so you can join either the resistance or you can join the enlightened.

316
00:20:16,556 --> 00:20:18,169
Scott: I would definitely just based on the names.

317
00:20:18,772 --> 00:20:19,255
Scott: Enlightened.

318
00:20:19,657 --> 00:20:20,099
Rym: Oh, yeah.

319
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,285
Rym: Also enlightened is green.

320
00:20:22,009 --> 00:20:23,253
Scott: Oh Definitely enlightened.

321
00:20:23,273 --> 00:20:24,196
Scott: Oh, here's the deal.

322
00:20:24,396 --> 00:20:27,746
Rym: The enlightened believe that wow power's come out of this dust.

323
00:20:28,187 --> 00:20:30,405
Rym: Let's use it to Transhuman.

324
00:20:31,251 --> 00:20:31,516
Scott: Yeah, okay.

325
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:33,634
Scott: so I'm still on the enlightened side.

326
00:20:33,714 --> 00:20:42,381
Rym: the resistance is worried about their powerful ramifications of this space bullshit and wants to fight against it and Wall humanity off from this awesome power.

327
00:20:42,401 --> 00:20:43,224
Scott: so Republicans.

328
00:20:43,726 --> 00:20:49,385
Rym: Yeah, pretty much Okay, so you can either play as an awesome green person or a shit bird blue person.

329
00:20:49,445 --> 00:20:49,706
Scott: Yep.

330
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:50,488
Scott: No red.

331
00:20:50,568 --> 00:20:51,070
Scott: It's not red.

332
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,619
Rym: There's only two factions green and blue green and blue.

333
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:54,602
Scott: Well fuck blue.

334
00:20:54,863 --> 00:20:56,890
Rym: So the way it works is there's portals that are out there.

335
00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:04,790
Rym: There's a separate mechanism where you can submit Places and pictures of things to to them and they slowly like new portals appear in places.

336
00:21:05,353 --> 00:21:08,330
Rym: But just you submitting a portal has nothing to do with the gameplay of the portal.

337
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:11,629
Rym: If you find a portal you can deploy resonators around it.

338
00:21:11,917 --> 00:21:12,167
Scott: Oh, yeah.

339
00:21:12,511 --> 00:21:18,114
Rym: And when you apply those then the portal starts building power and building power and you can hack it and get shit out of it Like guns and stuff.

340
00:21:18,355 --> 00:21:19,622
Scott: Mmm guns what?

341
00:21:19,642 --> 00:21:20,184
Rym: what weapons?

342
00:21:20,506 --> 00:21:27,070
Scott: Okay Bursters XMP bursters is what they're called, but their guns use the magic dust falling from the sky to make guns.

343
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:32,838
Rym: Well, that's one thing we do because we're not the people who are being trans human Like the being trans human does not what we're?

344
00:21:32,898 --> 00:21:34,585
Scott: wouldn't only the resistance make guns.

345
00:21:34,887 --> 00:21:35,670
Rym: We both make guns.

346
00:21:35,931 --> 00:21:43,912
Rym: We're the people who are trying to use these portals to gather the dust and accelerate humanity toward this trans human Awesome.

347
00:21:44,534 --> 00:21:45,116
Rym: So what do you do?

348
00:21:45,156 --> 00:21:54,090
Rym: is you hack the portals and then you can link multiple portals together and the distance You can link is based on the level and power and energy built up in the portal.

349
00:21:54,732 --> 00:22:03,519
Rym: So if you make a field by enclosing an entire area with links between your colors portals Then that area is in your zone of control.

350
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,318
Rym: the population of humans under that is now points for your side Mmm, so it's a fairly straightforward game.

351
00:22:10,358 --> 00:22:14,450
Rym: You're trying to cover the globe in your color and block the other guys.

352
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:16,223
Rym: So you might make a. you might coordinate with.

353
00:22:16,264 --> 00:22:17,070
Scott: how's New York looking?

354
00:22:18,234 --> 00:22:30,152
Rym: New York is all over the place but right now there's a big Huge fight going on downtown around City Hall and the entire area around City Hall Park is flipping from green and blue on a daily Basis.

355
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:33,488
Rym: and you're going on my way home.

356
00:22:33,528 --> 00:22:45,110
Rym: yesterday I blew up like eight portals claim them for my team and captured like four or five hundred thousand human points All right, and then the next day Queens looking some eighth level asshole.

357
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:47,217
Rym: So Queens is kind of a weird battleground right now.

358
00:22:47,518 --> 00:22:49,504
Rym: There's this huge green area.

359
00:22:49,524 --> 00:22:51,190
Rym: That's very heavily controlled.

360
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,101
Rym: It looks like there's three or four high-level dudes.

361
00:22:53,402 --> 00:22:57,241
Rym: We've just got that shit locked down Mmm, but there's a bunch of blue creeping its way in.

362
00:22:57,261 --> 00:23:02,580
Rym: so I shoot at it every day on my way to work Like the seven passes this one set of portals.

363
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,527
Rym: It's every damn like pew pew pew pew pew pew.

364
00:23:04,547 --> 00:23:06,295
Rym: as many shots as I can Get in while I pass.

365
00:23:06,476 --> 00:23:08,750
Scott: Oh, that's you're using the guns to shoot at the portals.

366
00:23:08,931 --> 00:23:11,381
Scott: So you can get guns out of the portals to shoot the portal.

367
00:23:11,401 --> 00:23:13,570
Rym: you get guns and resonators and items out of the portals.

368
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:20,698
Rym: You can upgrade portals with different things like turrets and whatever and if you hack a portal and it's your own team's portal You get a lot of stuff out of it.

369
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,661
Rym: If you hack an enemy portal a lot of time it just starts attacking you.

370
00:23:23,681 --> 00:23:28,118
Rym: hmm and That's pretty much a high-level dude.

371
00:23:28,139 --> 00:23:29,685
Scott: You can take the enemy portal down.

372
00:23:29,926 --> 00:23:30,730
Rym: Yeah, and I can.

373
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:33,818
Rym: There's max level right now is eight.

374
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,486
Scott: So how come you with all this playing?

375
00:23:35,506 --> 00:23:36,270
Scott: You're still not level eight.

376
00:23:36,931 --> 00:23:45,109
Rym: Uh, no, cuz I've only been playing for a few weeks and also more candy bun Refused to coordinate with people or power level or anything because the community is fucking intense.

377
00:23:45,914 --> 00:23:47,764
Rym: Like people are really into this get in on it.

378
00:23:48,669 --> 00:23:50,575
Scott: So Take City Hall.

379
00:23:50,615 --> 00:23:51,338
Scott: That's so.

380
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:52,421
Rym: I'm an opportunist.

381
00:23:52,461 --> 00:23:57,229
Rym: All I do is I watch and whenever there's trouble I'm there and I help out.

382
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:03,528
Rym: Although three separate people have messaged me because they saw my me doing stuff like this.

383
00:24:03,588 --> 00:24:04,270
Rym: all in our resonators.

384
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:06,037
Rym: They're like, are you the GeekNights Rym?

385
00:24:06,499 --> 00:24:07,141
Rym: Oh my god.

386
00:24:07,643 --> 00:24:08,567
Rym: I'm such a fan.

387
00:24:08,587 --> 00:24:14,210
Rym: Hey Hey, hey That's part of the reason why I'm not engaging too much in the community.

388
00:24:14,311 --> 00:24:16,511
Scott: Oh you get so people see when you do stuff Like.

389
00:24:16,531 --> 00:24:23,235
Rym: if you go like if you set up a portal like you captured it your name is on it Basically forever unless you lose it.

390
00:24:23,917 --> 00:24:24,780
Scott: Where's the Rym portals?

391
00:24:25,322 --> 00:24:31,661
Rym: Uh, all the Rym portals have been destroyed except for one right now But I have resonators with my name on them on tons of portals.

392
00:24:31,942 --> 00:24:34,470
Rym: Mmm, cuz I leave I upgrade people's things.

393
00:24:34,754 --> 00:24:35,748
Rym: I do like ng work.

394
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:41,615
Rym: The game is fun, but it has the problem that all Augmented reality games have.

395
00:24:42,197 --> 00:24:43,580
Rym: they're just candy box.

396
00:24:43,981 --> 00:24:51,109
Rym: if you're willing to do more things than the other team and Coordinate slightly more you just start winning.

397
00:24:52,053 --> 00:24:53,559
Scott: Candy box is not doing more things.

398
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:54,141
Scott: It's waiting.

399
00:24:54,202 --> 00:24:54,824
Scott: just patience.

400
00:24:55,045 --> 00:24:56,250
Rym: Ah, but this one's also patience.

401
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:56,752
Rym: You can just.

402
00:24:56,973 --> 00:25:01,970
Rym: you can wait to accumulate enough stuff and then go do a thing when you have enough stuff to where it would.

403
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:04,801
Rym: Okay, okay, but the difference is that.

404
00:25:05,142 --> 00:25:07,290
Rym: imagine if candy box and cookie clicker were combined.

405
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:08,615
Rym: So candy box is just going.

406
00:25:08,796 --> 00:25:12,549
Rym: you can just play or you can click to get extra candies.

407
00:25:14,011 --> 00:25:21,430
Rym: So it's more like the candy box of the 3ds games where if you're willing to go through the bullshit You'll level up way fast and be way powerful.

408
00:25:21,952 --> 00:25:31,950
Rym: And if you're just willing to go all the puzzle pieces if you're willing to do this shit every day Everywhere you go, you'll get powerful really quickly and have a big impact for your size.

409
00:25:32,892 --> 00:25:36,730
Rym: So it's fun, but I'm not going to get any more involved in it than I am now.

410
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:40,202
Rym: I will play it idly like I do all other candy box style games.

411
00:25:40,884 --> 00:25:45,297
Rym: if you care a lot about this game And you're one of those life stylers like.

412
00:25:45,337 --> 00:25:47,526
Rym: I see all these pictures of people who got legit tattoos.

413
00:25:48,068 --> 00:25:49,852
Scott: Yeah What?

414
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:50,938
Rym: because Google's got.

415
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,030
Rym: there's some contests going on where they're good.

416
00:25:53,030 --> 00:26:03,255
Rym: they're trying to track down like the five coolest agents and give them shit and Sometimes you'll get like media and missions and stuff out of these portals like specific missions You got to get done.

417
00:26:03,275 --> 00:26:08,580
Rym: I saw the New York team for the enlightened Coordinating this big thing where they had to.

418
00:26:08,641 --> 00:26:14,726
Rym: there's a portal on governor's island The ferries not running there anymore right now not now.

419
00:26:14,786 --> 00:26:18,541
Rym: Yeah, so The the enlightened still hold the portal.

420
00:26:18,983 --> 00:26:22,470
Scott: It's got like one resonator on it But no one can go there to put anything else on it.

421
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:29,789
Rym: So a few people have portal keys to it like sometimes you can get a portal key for a portal and then you can do stuff with that portal remotely.

422
00:26:30,492 --> 00:26:42,300
Rym: So they're trying to coordinate getting a huge link like many miles between that Particular portal and some other portal way off in Jersey Because that'll it'll basically cut the blue territory in half.

423
00:26:42,721 --> 00:26:44,546
Rym: So there's this big operation going on.

424
00:26:44,566 --> 00:26:45,971
Scott: I Don't know.

425
00:26:46,112 --> 00:26:49,068
Rym: It's moderately fun, but it's Nintendo 3ds candy box in the end.

426
00:26:55,131 --> 00:27:00,461
Rym: So I got five forty five and it's five forty five.

427
00:27:00,721 --> 00:27:04,849
Rym: well, I got five forty five and it's five forty five.

428
00:27:06,073 --> 00:27:10,372
Scott: Gotta get a whopper and a 40.

429
00:27:10,372 --> 00:27:11,304
Rym: Fuckin feel me.

430
00:27:13,151 --> 00:27:16,129
Rym: Actually, it's more like six fifty two, I'm glad it is.

431
00:27:17,173 --> 00:27:21,450
Rym: So I would rather be five forty five right now, but I'm glad that I have more than five forty five.

432
00:27:22,112 --> 00:27:28,600
Rym: So you might remember a charming a little video about the true history of Sodom and Gomorrah, I Think we made it things out.

433
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,718
Rym: I'm named after Gomorrah named after an even worse thing.

434
00:27:33,199 --> 00:27:36,270
Rym: So the real Brad Neely has a YouTube channel and that is where that is.

435
00:27:37,711 --> 00:27:44,670
Rym: The real Brad Neely is still making stuff and I stumbled upon this video that the song has just been stuck in my head.

436
00:27:45,231 --> 00:27:49,825
Rym: I have nothing but good things to say about it because it is exactly what it needs to be.

437
00:27:49,845 --> 00:27:56,188
Rym: This is kweeblow episode one Whopper and a 40. just watch it.

438
00:27:57,413 --> 00:27:59,149
Scott: Two things that I will not eat or drink.

439
00:28:00,974 --> 00:28:02,330
Scott: Speaking of eating and drinking.

440
00:28:03,212 --> 00:28:07,903
Scott: Some of my favorite people in the world have made a return to the internets.

441
00:28:08,284 --> 00:28:10,088
Scott: Oh, no the internet celebrities.

442
00:28:10,168 --> 00:28:12,197
Scott: Yeah Here they come.

443
00:28:12,338 --> 00:28:14,690
Scott: they have come back and they have brought us a new series.

444
00:28:15,713 --> 00:28:17,162
Rym: The series is such a good idea.

445
00:28:17,182 --> 00:28:18,390
Scott: the food warriors.

446
00:28:18,952 --> 00:28:27,609
Scott: What they are doing is they're gonna ride the a-train and at every stop on the a-train They are gonna find what people are eating.

447
00:28:28,591 --> 00:28:32,097
Scott: episode 1 168 Street an area.

448
00:28:32,218 --> 00:28:34,085
Scott: I know I have been there quite a few times.

449
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:38,960
Rym: I biked through a lot in the summer Yep, and now I know the names of four restaurants that seem good.

450
00:28:39,181 --> 00:28:42,050
Scott: Let's go there and eat at el president.

451
00:28:42,652 --> 00:28:55,090
Scott: We should make our own YouTube series following the food warriors and Malecon And all of these good restaurants that are up there and then Let us see the next stop on the a-train and eat at those locations as well.

452
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:57,690
Rym: These guys do everything that I like on the internet.

453
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:02,690
Scott: This is like the highlight of my day nay week nay month the fact that they are back.

454
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:04,095
Scott: They have been away for a while.

455
00:29:04,115 --> 00:29:06,584
Rym: We're going all the way all the way back.

456
00:29:06,605 --> 00:29:07,167
Rym: Oh, there you go.

457
00:29:07,628 --> 00:29:14,769
Rym: Yeah Alright, you're not good at saying to you cuz it's up to you it's not my culture but black dynamite like that.

458
00:29:16,571 --> 00:29:28,229
Rym: so in the meta moment the book club book is I do by William Gibson, I've already read it but I'm gonna read it again because I one liked it and two I want to be able to intelligent conversation about it.

459
00:29:28,711 --> 00:29:35,950
Rym: I just finished the Lac Lamora book the sixth book that I heard one while waiting for Scott to finish Stasi land.

460
00:29:37,945 --> 00:29:38,570
Rym: And it's okay.

461
00:29:39,932 --> 00:29:41,604
Rym: No, we don't need to do a book club book on it.

462
00:29:41,765 --> 00:29:45,159
Scott: It's okay You're a lock lever up and you probably want to read it.

463
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,104
Rym: Yeah, it's not great.

464
00:29:46,144 --> 00:29:51,322
Rym: It is the weakest of his books By far, but it's okay.

465
00:29:51,362 --> 00:29:52,789
Rym: We got a bunch of videos on the internet.

466
00:29:53,913 --> 00:29:54,175
Scott: We do.

467
00:29:54,457 --> 00:29:54,679
Rym: Yep.

468
00:29:54,982 --> 00:30:07,560
Rym: We're gonna be at magfest Probably doing a 90-minute version of bad games what we did at PAX Probably also being on one or two of the Mages panels renamed from the gaming intellectuals with a lot more people.

469
00:30:08,041 --> 00:30:13,996
Rym: We will be moderating and/or speaking on these panels And there'll be other people on them too.

470
00:30:14,117 --> 00:30:24,499
Rym: So unlike our usual lectures, you'll see us arguing with and being Somewhat adversarial toward other people in this industry dum-dums And also non-dum-dums.

471
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:26,106
Rym: Yep, you know who you are.

472
00:30:26,126 --> 00:30:26,830
Scott: That's right.

473
00:30:28,131 --> 00:30:29,155
Rym: Paxis is sold out.

474
00:30:29,255 --> 00:30:30,460
Rym: So yeah, too late.

475
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,544
Scott: Paxos almost.

476
00:30:31,785 --> 00:30:32,929
Rym: Paxos almost sold out.

477
00:30:34,331 --> 00:30:36,378
Scott: So I'm gonna get ready for PAX Prime tickets.

478
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:37,481
Scott: Watch your Twitter every day.

479
00:30:38,144 --> 00:30:46,809
Rym: I'm seriously considering just Reserving a hotel room now for PAX Prime outside of the con rate at a considerable expense.

480
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:57,349
Rym: All you Because I'm well actually Seattle's not so bad because the furthest hotel away is like a five-minute walk to PAX Red line unlike Boston.

481
00:30:58,814 --> 00:30:59,596
Rym: I mean, yeah.

482
00:30:59,696 --> 00:31:01,240
Rym: Anyway, this stuff's all sold out.

483
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,383
Rym: We're gonna be at all these things.

484
00:31:02,664 --> 00:31:05,010
Rym: probably not us, but maybe us.

485
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:07,335
Scott: Someone else pays for it.

486
00:31:07,676 --> 00:31:11,650
Scott: Ah, there's any benefactors out there who want to buy me a plane ticket to Australia.

487
00:31:11,791 --> 00:31:12,573
Scott: That's all it takes.

488
00:31:12,734 --> 00:31:15,143
Scott: I will pay for the hotels and other things while I'm there.

489
00:31:15,263 --> 00:31:22,130
Scott: if you would like a bespoke panel Yeah, I mean if you buy me a plane ticket, I will do something for you in return.

490
00:31:22,211 --> 00:31:25,771
Scott: That is within my power and is a fair Exchange.

491
00:31:26,192 --> 00:31:36,484
Rym: we have considered seriously at some point launching a Kickstarter for us to return to PAX Australia Do the panel do the video do a bunch of specific shows.

492
00:31:36,945 --> 00:31:38,430
Rym: I ran it by some Kickstarter people.

493
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:45,509
Rym: They said that as long as the deliverable is shows and content and not us just going to PAX Then it's fine.

494
00:31:46,611 --> 00:31:49,243
Rym: But I don't know if I'll do it because it's a pain in the ass pull out together.

495
00:31:49,263 --> 00:31:50,710
Rym: I might go without Scott.

496
00:31:50,973 --> 00:31:52,269
Rym: We'll see we'll play it by ear.

497
00:31:52,753 --> 00:31:55,914
Scott: so if I don't go there I'm going somewhere else.

498
00:31:55,934 --> 00:31:56,536
Scott: if you

499
00:31:56,757 --> 00:32:15,819
Rym: really want to see us at another PAX Australia either Email us and convince us to do a Kickstarter give us a pile of money or Somehow convince packs that were worth flying out and considering that they didn't fly out a lot of people who are cooler than us Probably not likely they're gonna fly us out.

500
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:16,903
Scott: No, but you can.

501
00:32:16,944 --> 00:32:21,250
Scott: only thing is like, you know It's like if they fly us out, they're gonna fly us right the fuck back.

502
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:22,115
Scott: They're not gonna like.

503
00:32:22,156 --> 00:32:24,450
Scott: let us, you know pay for us to hang out there a long time.

504
00:32:24,595 --> 00:32:29,070
Rym: Oh, no But the way that works like when I fly for work right because I'm going and I have to come back.

505
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:36,990
Rym: Anyway, they buy my plane tickets, but if I want to come back a week later, they still pay for the plane ticket But I'm on my own when I'm not on their time, of course.

506
00:32:37,412 --> 00:32:41,810
Rym: So I don't think we I think we're getting ahead of ourselves with the let's get packs to fly us out.

507
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:43,189
Scott: That's never gonna happen ever.

508
00:32:44,693 --> 00:32:47,010
Rym: Um, so yeah also our forum is super upgraded.

509
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:55,255
Rym: So if you and super expensive if you recently or at some point in the past used to go to our awesome forum and stop You might want to come back.

510
00:32:55,556 --> 00:33:00,414
Scott: It's uh, it's never like tried to register and failed or Anything like that.

511
00:33:00,475 --> 00:33:02,485
Rym: you quit because there was a feature that you wanted.

512
00:33:02,525 --> 00:33:03,510
Rym: that wasn't there.

513
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:06,679
Rym: It's the forum is so much better joined for some weird reason.

514
00:33:06,699 --> 00:33:10,230
Rym: Our forum is an ivory tower set on to the withering masses.

515
00:33:11,371 --> 00:33:11,532
Scott: Looks.

516
00:33:11,592 --> 00:33:13,180
Scott: everyone can see what's in the tower.

517
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,110
Scott: It's totally transparent and not ivory.

518
00:33:15,412 --> 00:33:18,790
Rym: It's the transparent tower, but it is nonetheless a tower.

519
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:21,521
Scott: Also, if you had a tower made of ivory you would totally go to jail.

520
00:33:22,124 --> 00:33:23,690
Rym: Did you see that government's destroying?

521
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:26,160
Scott: That's why I thought of that that multiple tons of ivory.

522
00:33:26,241 --> 00:33:28,270
Scott: I still I'm not sure like why I don't get it.

523
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,867
Scott: It's like how does that?

524
00:33:31,411 --> 00:33:33,338
Scott: Make them not want to kill elephant.

525
00:33:33,358 --> 00:33:36,410
Rym: So if they resell the ivory you don't want to do that either.

526
00:33:37,278 --> 00:33:38,350
Rym: So what put it all in a museum?

527
00:33:38,371 --> 00:33:45,790
Rym: Yeah They already filled and that part of the article said that they have already given all the ivory that every museum and outreach group wants.

528
00:33:46,535 --> 00:33:50,254
Rym: Okay, like they don't have any more Non-selling uses for it.

529
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:54,103
Rym: They've already pulled out all the actual historic artifacts all the.

530
00:33:54,264 --> 00:33:55,827
Scott: does it have any practical uses?

531
00:33:55,847 --> 00:34:02,785
Rym: Uh No, you know someone on FARC said something like really someone should work on an ivory substitute.

532
00:34:03,106 --> 00:34:07,968
Rym: and the second post was Yes, it's called plastic It's true.

533
00:34:08,299 --> 00:34:12,703
Rym: Yeah One guy was like my piano that has ivory sounds and feels so much better.

534
00:34:13,024 --> 00:34:21,009
Rym: and then the rest of the thread was everyone calling bullshit On that guy, of course the rationale I read for them destroying the ivory was that by destroying it?

535
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:24,481
Rym: They won't prove a point to reduce.

536
00:34:24,501 --> 00:34:27,050
Scott: the point that he proved is we will catch you.

537
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:28,514
Scott: Look how much ivory we caught.

538
00:34:28,795 --> 00:34:34,614
Rym: but also they reduce the supply of ivory which while on one hand you would argue would increase the That's what you would think.

539
00:34:34,635 --> 00:34:39,873
Scott: Yeah on the other hand and increase the demand as well the less ivory Wasn't on the market.

540
00:34:39,974 --> 00:34:43,746
Scott: Anyway, the harder it effectively was already destroyed.

541
00:34:43,786 --> 00:34:47,393
Rym: in those regards It's not the less legitimate ivory There is out there.

542
00:34:47,454 --> 00:34:48,136
Rym: that remains.

543
00:34:48,577 --> 00:34:52,110
Rym: the harder it is for you to explain yourself if you've got some ivory.

544
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:55,882
Rym: So it's easier for them to get people who they find with ivory on them.

545
00:34:56,445 --> 00:34:57,690
Scott: But who's gonna get that ivory?

546
00:34:58,710 --> 00:34:59,455
Rym: Well, no one now.

547
00:34:59,475 --> 00:35:01,849
Scott: Well, I mean even before it was destroyed who was gonna get it?

548
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:03,675
Scott: Well, it was in a vault somewhere.

549
00:35:03,695 --> 00:35:04,437
Scott: right vault.

550
00:35:04,658 --> 00:35:06,864
Rym: try just unlock government warehouse.

551
00:35:06,985 --> 00:35:11,349
Scott: I mean, yeah, that's yeah Probably more expensive to put it somewhere safe.

552
00:35:12,491 --> 00:35:14,137
Scott: That's just sending money for nothing.

553
00:35:14,759 --> 00:35:17,690
Rym: So when I was a kid, one of my favorite lawn games was bocce ball.

554
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:21,003
Scott: Well, I only played bocce like maybe a handful of times.

555
00:35:21,064 --> 00:35:22,330
Rym: I kind of want to get a bocce set.

556
00:35:22,431 --> 00:35:23,340
Rym: It's a good game to play.

557
00:35:23,582 --> 00:35:24,370
Rym: I like bocce a lot.

558
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:25,134
Scott: You don't need a set.

559
00:35:25,154 --> 00:35:29,627
Scott: if you come up to Astoria and Steinway and there's some courts there Play with the old guys.

560
00:35:31,075 --> 00:35:36,794
Rym: One of the apartment buildings that we're looking at to maybe move into in a year or two has a bocce Arena on the roof.

561
00:35:37,236 --> 00:35:37,356
Scott: Mm-hmm.

562
00:35:37,919 --> 00:35:39,966
Scott: So yeah old people must live there.

563
00:35:40,348 --> 00:35:41,592
Rym: bocce ball I don't know.

564
00:35:41,632 --> 00:35:41,873
Rym: It's this.

565
00:35:41,953 --> 00:35:47,670
Rym: it's the same game as horseshoes effectively for all intents and purposes sort of same gist.

566
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:51,163
Rym: You're trying to get something close to something else closer than other people.

567
00:35:51,183 --> 00:35:52,669
Scott: You know, there are subtle differences.

568
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:58,425
Rym: You can't disrupt another person's horseshoe the way that you can disrupt another person's bocce ball.

569
00:35:58,465 --> 00:35:59,247
Scott: Oh, they got a leaner.

570
00:35:59,447 --> 00:36:00,149
Scott: you can mess it up.

571
00:36:01,855 --> 00:36:04,970
Rym: I see you're deep in the terminology lingo.

572
00:36:06,031 --> 00:36:07,476
Rym: I'm gonna throw the jack ball.

573
00:36:07,516 --> 00:36:07,998
Rym: so far.

574
00:36:08,038 --> 00:36:09,162
Rym: You can't even get it out there.

575
00:36:09,423 --> 00:36:13,136
Scott: Yeah, so one time I was Speaking of bocce, right?

576
00:36:13,156 --> 00:36:15,869
Scott: I have less experience with bocce, but I have experience with something else.

577
00:36:17,392 --> 00:36:21,830
Scott: I was going to Whitney Museum, I think and I heard something happening a few blocks away.

578
00:36:22,051 --> 00:36:28,454
Scott: So I went to this a few blocks away and there was this street that was closed off in Manhattan All right and they were playing this game.

579
00:36:28,474 --> 00:36:31,486
Scott: that looked a lot like bocce, but it wasn't bocce.

580
00:36:31,506 --> 00:36:34,014
Scott: and I was like What is this game?

581
00:36:34,034 --> 00:36:38,850
Scott: and they were everyone is speaking French and there was like a French sponsorship and everything was French.

582
00:36:39,132 --> 00:36:41,930
Scott: Oh, and I was like, whoa, is this like the street where French people live?

583
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:42,768
Scott: What is going on here?

584
00:36:43,551 --> 00:36:50,574
Scott: And I couldn't figure out what it was because everyone was speaking in French II and I was like what the hell couldn't even pick out any cognates.

585
00:36:51,297 --> 00:36:54,029
Scott: and you know, it's it's easier for me to do Spanish than France II.

586
00:36:54,069 --> 00:37:05,239
Scott: so Eventually, I figured out the game they were playing was petunk Petunka which is very similar to bocce and it's actually really interesting petunk.

587
00:37:06,451 --> 00:37:08,256
Scott: Yeah, PETA and QUE.

588
00:37:08,356 --> 00:37:09,800
Scott: and it's a really interesting game.

589
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:10,502
Scott: and here's how it works.

590
00:37:10,803 --> 00:37:17,109
Scott: You throw out first this sort of Object, I guess it's a jack of some kind, right?

591
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:21,486
Rym: It looks like it's the same as the jack ball in bocce, but it's like a metal thing I think.

592
00:37:21,747 --> 00:37:24,701
Rym: well in bocce It's just a smaller ball.

593
00:37:24,781 --> 00:37:25,505
Scott: Yeah, I think in this one.

594
00:37:25,525 --> 00:37:26,590
Scott: I think it's like a metal ball.

595
00:37:26,691 --> 00:37:31,330
Rym: Anyway, small wooden ball ball called a caution nets Yeah.

596
00:37:32,733 --> 00:37:46,970
Scott: And then you throw out the basically the bocce balls and you're just trying to get close to the first one right just like similar to bocce, but here's the way it scores is Whoever has the closest ball Gets that balls gets points, right?

597
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:53,884
Scott: So let's say I have the closest ball and you have the second closest and then all the other balls don't matter Because I I have the closest one.

598
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:58,750
Scott: That's the only one that matters All right, so I get a point and you get nothing because mine was closer.

599
00:37:59,432 --> 00:38:05,570
Scott: Let's say I have three balls that are close and your ball your closest ball is the fourth closest.

600
00:38:06,332 --> 00:38:08,336
Scott: Then all three of mine score.

601
00:38:08,376 --> 00:38:11,844
Scott: so I get three points because your closest was the fourth closest.

602
00:38:12,546 --> 00:38:16,839
Scott: if my closest is like the fifth Closest then you get four points or I'm right.

603
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:17,240
Rym: Yes.

604
00:38:17,321 --> 00:38:18,003
Rym: Nice diagram.

605
00:38:18,063 --> 00:38:19,970
Rym: Okay, so the big balls are metal.

606
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:22,137
Rym: The jack ball is a little lime looking thing.

607
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:22,940
Scott: Oh, yeah.

608
00:38:23,041 --> 00:38:23,281
Scott: Okay.

609
00:38:23,944 --> 00:38:25,148
Scott: But yeah, it's it's right.

610
00:38:25,208 --> 00:38:29,183
Scott: so bocce They're sort of like wooden or stonish kind of weird material.

611
00:38:29,424 --> 00:38:34,086
Rym: Wow, there's a. there is a Pretty intense standards organization around this game.

612
00:38:34,106 --> 00:38:42,556
Rym: Yeah The jack they were playing must be made of wood or of a specific synthetic material must carry the maker's mark and have secured confirmation by the Fi.

613
00:38:42,616 --> 00:38:49,826
Rym: PJ P. Yep The tolerance is there is one millimeter for a 30 millimeter ball.

614
00:38:49,846 --> 00:38:50,127
Rym: Mm-hmm.

615
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,920
Rym: Yep Oh glossary or special terms.

616
00:38:52,961 --> 00:38:54,630
Scott: All right telling these people are really serious.

617
00:38:56,033 --> 00:39:00,244
Rym: Lob is not a special term guys Lob is a generic word.

618
00:39:00,264 --> 00:39:01,855
Rym: Oh You can.

619
00:39:02,097 --> 00:39:03,710
Rym: you can get a metro fanny.

620
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:10,416
Rym: to win the game without the opposing team scoring any points is a To fanny the opponents.

621
00:39:10,516 --> 00:39:16,762
Scott: Yeah, right if all of your balls are closer than all of their balls then you Say he made fanny.

622
00:39:16,823 --> 00:39:19,152
Scott: That's the best possible Fanny.

623
00:39:19,172 --> 00:39:27,190
Scott: that's like in shuffleboard when all your guys are on scoring points and all their guys are in like the - and must kiss The bottom of a girl named what?

624
00:39:27,857 --> 00:39:28,130
Rym: Wikipedia.

625
00:39:29,032 --> 00:39:31,122
Rym: Okay, something about fannies anyway.

626
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:45,907
Rym: I Learned about bocce when I was a kid because it was a popular sport among old people who lived in Detroit in the Midwest And whenever there were garden parties or lawn parties or block parties The old people would all go play bocce in this one backyard.

627
00:39:45,948 --> 00:39:52,070
Rym: when I was a kid Yeah, so I would always go over there because I kind of didn't like all the normal little kids in my neighborhood.

628
00:39:52,472 --> 00:39:57,169
Rym: So I'd go over with those old people and be super polite until they'd eventually let me watch and/or play bocce with them.

629
00:39:57,410 --> 00:40:02,150
Scott: Hmm for us it the kids are the people who wanted to play lawn type games.

630
00:40:02,231 --> 00:40:08,510
Rym: The adults didn't want to do anything In the Midwest they had like lawn games were the thing to do as an adult at a party.

631
00:40:09,631 --> 00:40:13,730
Scott: Yeah, adults didn't play lawn games really except kids would like maybe try to force them.

632
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:16,101
Scott: And of course our number one lawn game was wiffle ball.

633
00:40:16,362 --> 00:40:18,010
Scott: Yeah, not forget any of these others.

634
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:26,399
Scott: I mean, you know, there was an occasional badminton Big up on badminton or this ghetto soccer Or capture the flag.

635
00:40:26,419 --> 00:40:28,829
Rym: I don't know if capture the flag is really a long game.

636
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:29,753
Scott: It was for us.

637
00:40:30,035 --> 00:40:32,184
Scott: use the whole lawn, but you can see everybody.

638
00:40:32,224 --> 00:40:33,569
Rym: is it just tackle like how do you do it?

639
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:44,245
Scott: the way we would do it back in the day is You would basically one half of the lawn in front of the house is one side and the other half of the lawn the other Half of the house is the other side, right?

640
00:40:44,265 --> 00:40:47,718
Scott: All right, and You would basically just grab someone.

641
00:40:47,758 --> 00:40:54,030
Scott: if you could just grab someone and just drag them to the jail Then they were in the jail until someone rescued them, right?

642
00:40:55,271 --> 00:41:08,189
Scott: And you rescued people in the jail by going in and getting them out you see to get to the jail which is in the enemy territory and then The flag would just be fucking hidden somewhere and the other half of the lawn see to get over there.

643
00:41:08,992 --> 00:41:13,890
Scott: You know, you could sneak over there possibly by doing trickery like, you know, you'd play in the dark, right?

644
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:20,218
Scott: So you sneak like into the neighbor's lawns sneak up and then hop into the other backyard Where no one saw you hop in.

645
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,570
Scott: then you have a few minutes to look around for the flag.

646
00:41:22,711 --> 00:41:37,810
Scott: Maybe you could run fast grab it and get away from everyone, you know, so it's a combination of speed One person running and making a sacrifice as someone else can make a move Pushing someone down and going past them, you know all kinds of maneuvers were available.

647
00:41:38,573 --> 00:41:42,548
Scott: You know some woods areas bordering some of the people's houses you could take advantage of.

648
00:41:42,568 --> 00:41:50,580
Rym: so I guess one thing I'm noticing is that the lawn games that kids tended to enjoy Tended to be pretty super serious for the kids involved.

649
00:41:50,961 --> 00:42:02,104
Rym: like their full focus and I remember I was the same way Was on the game, of course Even if the rules were kind of loose the kids would focus on the game a hundred percent and all Socialization was based around the game.

650
00:42:02,225 --> 00:42:07,889
Rym: Mm-hmm I've seen some adults do that like the old people playing bocce 100% focused on the bocce.

651
00:42:08,131 --> 00:42:08,472
Scott: Is it?

652
00:42:08,532 --> 00:42:13,730
Scott: kids and old people and nerds all of the same mind and then everyone else not?

653
00:42:14,071 --> 00:42:15,456
Rym: Yeah, the everyone else.

654
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:17,683
Scott: it seems like it's like you go to an old.

655
00:42:17,703 --> 00:42:22,039
Scott: you go to an old play old folks place in Florida, right and it's like I'm playing shuffleboard.

656
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:23,525
Scott: kids are playing shuffleboard.

657
00:42:23,706 --> 00:42:26,402
Scott: Grandpa's playing shuffleboard Everyone's trying to win at shuffleboard.

658
00:42:26,422 --> 00:42:27,390
Scott: And what's the conversation?

659
00:42:28,111 --> 00:42:29,236
Scott: Hit is hit is 10.

660
00:42:29,236 --> 00:42:31,586
Scott: You can bump them into the - you can bump them in.

661
00:42:31,747 --> 00:42:34,177
Scott: they'll go for it Right or no?

662
00:42:34,237 --> 00:42:34,820
Scott: play it safe.

663
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:35,101
Scott: Don't?

664
00:42:35,141 --> 00:42:36,125
Scott: we already got a lot of points.

665
00:42:36,145 --> 00:42:37,210
Scott: Just don't knock our points out.

666
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:39,063
Scott: Just just you know, don't even try to score.

667
00:42:39,103 --> 00:42:39,990
Scott: just push it real easy.

668
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:40,494
Scott: It's the last.

669
00:42:40,656 --> 00:42:42,310
Scott: it's the last buck, you know.

670
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:49,047
Scott: But everyone else of any other age group or non nerd Leaning would just like sit by the pool talking.

671
00:42:49,228 --> 00:42:55,470
Rym: or well I think what it comes down to is that the the ideal lawn games are games that can serve both purposes.

672
00:42:55,530 --> 00:43:10,480
Rym: They can serve the purpose of a serious focused competition, which is easier for kids because kids seem to be able to make Games that don't have rules somehow very competitive and serious in a way that no one Smarter or older will ever be able to do.

673
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:19,030
Scott: I think what it is right is you look and you know Board games and stuff and there's the serious games right that we play right like the ogre that just showed up.

674
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:22,010
Rym: Oh my god, that ogre box is so big, right?

675
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:31,424
Scott: but then you have the apples to apples and the cards against humanity and the party games in Basically long games are the party games of sports, right?

676
00:43:31,465 --> 00:43:42,946
Scott: It's like you're not gonna play fucking NFL football you're gonna play Croquette you're not gonna play PGA golf You know or anything like that you play badminton.

677
00:43:42,986 --> 00:43:46,376
Scott: It's like it's Apples-to-apples is to.

678
00:43:46,758 --> 00:43:54,423
Scott: you know, Puerto Rico as I don't know Horseshoes is to like for example.

679
00:43:54,543 --> 00:43:55,990
Rym: Tokyo is a simple example.

680
00:43:56,110 --> 00:44:01,510
Rym: You can play that game super serious and have the social interaction center around the game while you're playing it.

681
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:06,310
Rym: Sure, but you can also play it casually where you're putting most of your attention into the game.

682
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:08,949
Rym: But you're socializing in equal parts.

683
00:44:09,491 --> 00:44:14,647
Rym: And I think the the optimal lawn games are the ones that allow for both.

684
00:44:14,688 --> 00:44:18,482
Rym: They have some Reasonable real ortho game component.

685
00:44:18,522 --> 00:44:19,930
Rym: There's a real competition there.

686
00:44:20,111 --> 00:44:23,710
Scott: Well, it's usually it's usually sport and that it's some sort of actual dexterity skill.

687
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:28,627
Rym: Yes, right something physical you have to do but so it is an ortho game sport in some capacity.

688
00:44:28,667 --> 00:44:46,659
Rym: the closer to like You know jungle speed and it is serious or difficult enough Requires enough skill to where you can have meaningful social interaction Centered solely on the game like you can't have meaningful social interaction around a game of tic-tac-toe Even though tic-tac-toe is an ortho game.

689
00:44:46,819 --> 00:44:48,788
Rym: Sure, but there's no.

690
00:44:48,908 --> 00:44:52,480
Rym: how many Sentences can you say related to a game of tic-tac-toe?

691
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,366
Rym: while you play it with someone you win.

692
00:44:54,747 --> 00:44:55,168
Scott: It's time.

693
00:44:55,289 --> 00:44:56,265
Scott: It's time It's time.

694
00:44:56,591 --> 00:45:16,683
Rym: So as a result these games are perfect when they are both an ortho game But to do not require the full attention of the players such that you can choose to socialize Solely in the context of the game which is good for kids who may not you know know each other that will or anything else to talk about and is good for Old people because they want the game to be the focus.

695
00:45:16,703 --> 00:45:18,330
Rym: They're tired of talking to all their old friends.

696
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:21,550
Rym: They want to just play this game and the game provides a social context.

697
00:45:22,071 --> 00:45:31,754
Rym: but they also allow the in-between where you're kind of half socializing about the game, but using that as a Also.

698
00:45:31,814 --> 00:45:41,403
Scott: the thing about them is that while it is possible to have a high level of skill right at games Of this nature right like you can be Olympic badminton gold medal.

699
00:45:41,464 --> 00:45:45,136
Scott: Oh my god, right, but Badminton's not like tennis.

700
00:45:45,197 --> 00:45:48,010
Scott: or if you suck you can't do anything like yeah, you can hit it.

701
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:55,298
Scott: It's kind of slow ish, especially when the other people hitting it aren't Olympic badminton people So it's it's like a sport that's accessible.

702
00:45:55,418 --> 00:45:59,189
Scott: Anyone can actually play this and have a meaningful contribution.

703
00:45:59,229 --> 00:46:10,670
Scott: horseshoes It's like yeah, you if you got professional horseshoe persons getting a ringer every fucking time almost just like a bowler get you know Professional bowler gets mostly strikes and spares with a few nines and eights and not really anything less than that.

704
00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:17,356
Scott: But you know if you throw horseshoes and you've never done it before You'll score some points.

705
00:46:17,377 --> 00:46:18,624
Scott: You're not gonna get zero.

706
00:46:19,106 --> 00:46:19,569
Scott: get something.

00:46:20,091 --> 00:46:21,858
Rym: I feel really bad newborn baby.

708
00:46:21,878 --> 00:46:23,102
Rym: I feel really bad for the guy.

709
00:46:23,142 --> 00:46:25,149
Rym: listen to the show who's never scored a point in horseshoes.

710
00:46:26,551 --> 00:46:28,740
Scott: It's like yeah, listen you stand there and throw enough horseshoes.

711
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,406
Scott: you measure is unceasing you're gonna hit it.

Scott: it's gonna happen Right, you know what?

713
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:35,094
Scott: I noticed it's really popular lately Even though I never played it.

714
00:46:35,535 --> 00:46:40,161
Scott: the game where you have the slanted wooden board with a hole in it and you throw bean bags Trying to get in the hole.

715
00:46:40,181 --> 00:46:42,520
Scott: Oh Cornhole, I don't know.

Scott: I guess that what it's called I see bringing that to the beach.

00:46:46,737 --> 00:46:50,710
Scott: I seen people playing that in football stadium parking lots while tailgating.

00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:55,010
Scott: I see that game everywhere and it's like oh, yeah, it's something everyone can play.

719
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:56,450
Scott: It's got a skill to it, right?

720
00:46:56,750 --> 00:47:03,132
Scott: You know and it's it's actually can actually be pretty intense because you throw that thing and it's like slides up the board after it Hits.

721
00:47:03,555 --> 00:47:09,614
Scott: so it has a little bit of that golf action where it's like Yeah, that's cornhole.

722

Rym: It was in some TV show.

726
00:47:19,217 --> 00:47:24,618
Rym: that's popular or Someone like made a version of it like a Hasbro and then marketed it.

727
00:47:24,779 --> 00:47:25,060
Scott: I don't know.

733
00:47:31,913 --> 00:47:37,640
Scott: I see playing it I see normal people doing it, but it's I see more and more of that game every year in various places.

734
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:39,005
Scott: I did not expect to see it.

735
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:45,409
Scott: It used to be like a thing that you would see and like Summer camp maybe and that was about it.

Scott: And now I'm seeing it and all sorts of other places.

00:47:52,727 --> 00:47:57,000
Rym: Our friend had a huge party at his new house and he did long games.
