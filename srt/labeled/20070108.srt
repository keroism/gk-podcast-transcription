1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,187
Rym: It's Monday January 8th.

2
00:00:11,689 --> 00:00:14,720
Scott: I'm Rym and I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:14,801 --> 00:00:17,459
Rym: We explained the differences between all of those computer majors.

4
00:00:19,281 --> 00:00:20,318
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:21,902 --> 00:00:26,480
Rym: So not only are we back finally after the holidays to be in tired, but I'm fully well arrested.

6
00:00:26,904 --> 00:00:33,300
Rym: I think we're totally back in action 100% at least for another week until we play D&D this weekend and that all goes to hell.

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,748
Scott: It's only downhill from here people.

8
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:35,572
Rym: Yeah, pretty much.

9
00:00:35,914 --> 00:00:41,469
Scott: So enjoy this vault last All right, so what's been happening lately, I don't know.

10
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:44,640
Rym: we spent a weekend going up the road being consumer whores.

11
00:00:46,002 --> 00:00:46,744
Scott: Yeah that we did.

12
00:00:46,765 --> 00:00:52,326
Scott: I got a new phone which I didn't talk about because I was waiting for an actual Monday show and we Missed two Monday shows.

13
00:00:52,587 --> 00:00:54,740
Rym: Yep, and we got a bunch of board games.

14
00:00:55,081 --> 00:01:02,666
Scott: yeah, not gonna say much about the phone because I ended up not getting a fancy smartphone or whatever because Phones in the US suck ass.

15
00:01:03,147 --> 00:01:21,197
Scott: All I can say is if you're in an area in which Verizon is the only Provider that offers service as I am And you know Verizon tends to lock down their phones way more than anyone else The LG vx8600 is less locked down than some of your other choices.

16
00:01:21,638 --> 00:01:29,280
Rym: That's all I'll say Yeah, also Scott can play mp3s out of his phone from a tiny tiny tiny little piece of memory.

17
00:01:29,581 --> 00:01:30,525
Scott: Yeah that I can.

18
00:01:31,167 --> 00:01:31,890
Scott: it is quite fun.

19
00:01:32,372 --> 00:01:32,572
Rym: Yes.

20
00:01:32,632 --> 00:01:34,640
Rym: I mean tiny physically not tiny in terms of space.

21
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:43,420
Scott: It's not gonna replace my iPod anytime soon, but I can carry around like, you know The cool songs I found lately and I could also make ringtones and stuff.

22
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,323
Scott: But you know.

23
00:01:44,363 --> 00:01:49,440
Scott: and then if someone said if I'm recommending music to someone like oh have you heard this or that?

24
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:55,127
Scott: And if they haven't I could just play it for him on the phone and the phone speaker ain't so bad at least not For you.

25
00:01:55,147 --> 00:01:55,897
Scott: know, do you like this?

26
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,937
Rym: So now it'll be all those times when we're somewhere and then someone says mock and I supremacy.

27
00:02:00,977 --> 00:02:05,318
Scott: I never heard of that And I could just push a button on the front of my phone and it starts playing.

28
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:07,085
Rym: we're ready We're ready to fix those people.

29
00:02:07,266 --> 00:02:08,270
Rym: Yep, right.

30
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,299
Rym: So I guess in the news get right into this here.

31
00:02:11,362 --> 00:02:28,522
Rym: one of the biggest problems with desktop Linux in terms of being used by anyone other than I don't know people like you listening to this show and people like us is that For various reasons a lot of things that should just be in Linux and come with a computer or at least be very easy to Install.

32
00:02:28,823 --> 00:02:33,920
Scott: well, a lot of these things don't even come with Windows or Mac like codecs for playing different video files and such.

33
00:02:34,182 --> 00:02:40,554
Rym: Oh, yeah, but for people who aren't used to Linux It's a lot easier to get them for Windows than it is to get them for Linux.

34
00:02:40,675 --> 00:02:42,080
Rym: I mean remember the window.

35
00:02:42,361 --> 00:02:43,125
Scott: It's not easy.

36
00:02:43,326 --> 00:02:46,260
Scott: I mean once you it's it's more obvious how to do it.

37
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,700
Rym: Well, what I'm saying is it's easier for them based on their knowledge.

38
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,111
Scott: I guess they already know how to do it for Windows.

39
00:02:52,211 --> 00:02:54,160
Rym: Well, the Windows paradigm is very different.

40
00:02:54,200 --> 00:03:01,520
Rym: There's definitely the idea of go out get software download and executable run it to install install it somewhere.

41
00:03:01,853 --> 00:03:13,300
Rym: Yep the idea that does not exist on the the idea of a repository where all your software is just in it and you just say install this install this and it automatically happens is utterly alien and strange.

42
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:22,080
Rym: I mean back in IT at RIT and I was taking you know Like sysadmin one and all those early crap classes about Linux and Unix and servers and whatever.

43
00:03:22,942 --> 00:03:28,820
Rym: Whenever we were doing a Linux lab most people and getting going into IT didn't really know much about Linux or never used it before.

44
00:03:29,381 --> 00:03:34,756
Rym: So one of the most common questions in these classes was so I just installed patchy Apache.

45
00:03:35,157 --> 00:03:36,200
Rym: Where is it installed?

46
00:03:36,761 --> 00:03:38,139
Rym: Where is the Apache directory?

47
00:03:39,364 --> 00:03:40,920
Rym: Where is the icon for Apache?

48
00:03:42,201 --> 00:03:43,104
Rym: What's going on?

49
00:03:43,485 --> 00:03:46,213
Rym: I'm scared and confused and lost low.

50
00:03:46,674 --> 00:03:48,700
Scott: So I was like that back in 1999.

51
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:53,410
Scott: Oh 98 no 99 in 98.

52
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,421
Scott: I don't think I had a computer that could run Linux in 99.

53
00:03:56,421 --> 00:03:58,057
Rym: I knew what Linux was but I'd never used it.

54
00:03:58,782 --> 00:04:03,300
Rym: Wasn't until I got to RIT that I installed Mandrake and I started using Red Hat 7.3.

55
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:07,861
Scott: I used Linux in 99, but I didn't really use it until like 2000 2001.

56
00:04:07,861 --> 00:04:09,166
Rym: But anyway, this is a big problem.

57
00:04:09,206 --> 00:04:17,805
Rym: that especially even the best most easy to use distro out there for desktop Linux Ubuntu Ubuntu Has this problem.

58
00:04:17,987 --> 00:04:27,720
Rym: you get it and it comes with a bunch of stuff and it just works Unless you want to use flash or Java or you want the real acrobat reader or well the job.

59
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,490
Scott: I think they solve that problem because Sun changed their license.

60
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:31,815
Rym: Yeah, but that is a recent develop.

61
00:04:31,835 --> 00:04:32,778
Scott: That is a recent development.

62
00:04:32,798 --> 00:04:39,066
Scott: or video codecs audio codecs your Nvidia driver Yeah, all that stuff.

63
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:42,200
Scott: and the reason you don't get that stuff is for legal reasons.

64
00:04:42,461 --> 00:04:53,020
Rym: Well two levels of there's legal reasons and ideological reasons and Half of it is legal reasons that the people who make these things just their licenses are either broken or restrictive or whatever.

65
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:57,080
Scott: For example, their license will say something like you may not distribute this software.

66
00:04:57,564 --> 00:05:02,671
Scott: So if you want to get this software Even though it might be free you have to get it from them.

67
00:05:03,173 --> 00:05:05,080
Scott: or there might be some end-user license agreement.

68
00:05:05,161 --> 00:05:07,079
Scott: You have to agree to that's on their website.

69
00:05:07,302 --> 00:05:13,899
Scott: so it would be illegal for me to Agree to the agreement and then give you the software because you didn't agree to the agreement on the website.

70
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:29,140
Rym: or this happens a lot to ideological reasons in that the people who maintain Linux distros or Linux in general or BSD or what have you Tend to look down upon software that is not as free if not freer than whatever they're making.

71
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,305
Scott: yeah, so they make all.

72
00:05:30,365 --> 00:05:37,314
Scott: they make all this Linux and all this software that runs on Linux open source and The Nvidia driver is not open source at all.

73
00:05:37,595 --> 00:05:38,640
Scott: You have no idea what's in there.

74
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,566
Scott: So they just refuse to have non open source stuff in their deal Even though there's no legal reason.

75
00:05:43,586 --> 00:05:48,197
Rym: they couldn't have it in there or make it easy to be installed or make a button that installs It when you get it.

76
00:05:48,501 --> 00:05:56,750
Rym: They just they want to pressure the industry and other people who write software for companies Into conforming to their free software ideal.

77
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:05,064
Rym: and while I very much support the free software ideal I think part of that is that you don't force people who don't want to go along with it to open everything they ever do Up for free.

78
00:06:05,085 --> 00:06:13,480
Scott: Yeah, I mean if I have a choice I mean I would prefer if there was open source stuff, you know They the Nvidia network card driver used to be closed.

79
00:06:13,942 --> 00:06:16,874
Scott: There is still a closed source one, but they came out with an open source one.

80
00:06:17,035 --> 00:06:18,200
Scott: That was that actually worked.

81
00:06:18,701 --> 00:06:19,384
Scott: So I switched.

82
00:06:19,665 --> 00:06:22,113
Rym: yeah, well like nothing I would do for technology.

83
00:06:22,153 --> 00:06:28,620
Rym: I would ever attempt to patent or Enforce copyright or anything on and I would pretty much GPL just about anything I ever did.

84
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:32,540
Scott: Yeah, I mean if I could use everything in the whole world open source, that would be the best thing in the world.

85
00:06:32,641 --> 00:06:33,693
Scott: I would be very happy.

86
00:06:33,713 --> 00:06:38,976
Rym: Well Notwithstanding the patent IBM has in Mars trying to get in my name right no control over.

87
00:06:39,137 --> 00:06:42,019
Scott: but anyway I want my video card to work.

88
00:06:42,582 --> 00:06:45,533
Scott: I am willing to sacrifice the fact that I can't it's not.

89
00:06:45,553 --> 00:06:58,777
Scott: my choices are at the present time You know this is the reality of the world either use a closed source video card driver to get my video card to work properly or Use an open source driver that works kind of shittily now.

90
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:01,110
Rym: Here's the This factory.

91
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,900
Rym: here's the s9 is of this whole situation.

92
00:07:03,681 --> 00:07:04,605
Rym: It's still free.

93
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:07,660
Rym: It's just free as in beer and not free as in speech.

94
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:18,633
Rym: So even though it's perfectly free a lot of zealots still refuse to allow these things to be easily used or automatically used Because it's not as free as they'd like it to be even though it's still free.

95
00:07:19,075 --> 00:07:20,460
Scott: Yeah, there are crazy people out there.

96
00:07:20,801 --> 00:07:25,180
Scott: You know, it's one thing you don't want to buy an Nvidia video card because they don't have an open source driver.

97
00:07:25,261 --> 00:07:26,380
Scott: That's all that's good by you.

98
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:33,083
Scott: you can go buy a video card that is, you know supported by open source software in the kernel and Hooray for you.

99
00:07:33,464 --> 00:07:35,050
Rym: Yeah, good luck doing anything.

100
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:35,551
Rym: three.

101
00:07:35,572 --> 00:07:37,900
Scott: Do you look at the users of Ubuntu?

102
00:07:39,342 --> 00:07:50,312
Scott: Most of them have Nvidia or ATI cards and most of them want the drivers, you know back when before Ubuntu had the proper Firefox Icon there was a huge thread of people wanting the real icon.

103
00:07:50,713 --> 00:07:55,580
Scott: Most of the users are not zealots It's just most of the developers are the crazy zealots.

104
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:04,500
Rym: Ubuntu Ubuntu is Making great strides toward overcoming this and there is now a package only available to people using feisty fawn.

105
00:08:04,641 --> 00:08:09,407
Rym: So if you're a little bit ahead of the curve Drake is the current super safe one.

106
00:08:09,528 --> 00:08:10,651
Scott: edgy effed is like the.

107
00:08:10,671 --> 00:08:13,238
Scott: you're a badass one and feisty fawn is the.

108
00:08:13,438 --> 00:08:13,960
Scott: you're crazy.

109
00:08:14,462 --> 00:08:16,429
Rym: Yeah, I would recommend using edgy for now.

110
00:08:17,071 --> 00:08:19,279
Scott: if edgy works use edgy if not use dapper.

111
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,500
Scott: Yep Don't use feisty fawn until it's ready.

112
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:29,280
Rym: Unless you it's not your primary computer or you just really want to be experimental and have some fun and possibly have some problems.

113
00:08:29,641 --> 00:08:33,474
Scott: Yeah, don't don't use feisty fawn on your main important computer.

114
00:08:33,494 --> 00:08:34,096
Scott: that has to work.

115
00:08:34,176 --> 00:08:47,696
Rym: but for feisty fawn There's a new official meta package called Ubuntu - restricted - extras and it automatically installs a bunch of codecs Flash Java and the Microsoft fonts new Microsoft fonts.

116
00:08:47,717 --> 00:08:48,560
Scott: That's the one I forget about.

117
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,313
Rym: Yeah, I don't know if it does all of them, but I imagine it does.

118
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:52,800
Scott: the MSTTF core fonts.

119
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:55,920
Rym: It probably does the ones that can technically be gained for free.

120
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,272
Scott: Yeah, it's like the ariel the tahoma the verdana though.

121
00:08:59,292 --> 00:09:00,858
Scott: That's it health Attica.

122
00:09:00,898 --> 00:09:02,061
Scott: Whatever is in there I don't remember.

123
00:09:02,402 --> 00:09:15,760
Rym: so props to the Ubuntu team or whoever put this forth or whoever is pushing for this inside of Ubuntu to Make open source and Linux more accessible to normal people as opposed to just people like us.

124
00:09:16,242 --> 00:09:20,780
Scott: Now the now when people ask, you know, how do I get all these things to work in my Ubuntu?

125
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:27,512
Scott: I can tell them one single command to type in apt-get install Something restricted whatevers.

126
00:09:27,914 --> 00:09:28,376
Scott: What did you say?

127
00:09:28,396 --> 00:09:28,899
Scott: It was called?

128
00:09:29,641 --> 00:09:37,772
Rym: Ubuntu - restricted - extras also Automatically wallets installing enables the multiverse and universe repositories.

129
00:09:38,113 --> 00:09:40,680
Rym: So you don't even it sells all these problems.

130
00:09:40,741 --> 00:09:49,280
Rym: So it'll open up this whole world To people who don't know much about computers but happen to be using Ubuntu but don't know that there's a multiverse and a universe.

131
00:09:49,461 --> 00:09:50,004
Rym: Yeah, it'll.

132
00:09:50,124 --> 00:09:51,009
Scott: it'll fix everything.

133
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:58,685
Scott: But basically you won't need to use either easy Ubuntu easy Ubuntu or Automatics anymore.

134
00:09:58,785 --> 00:10:01,213
Scott: Those are basically useless because of this which is good.

135
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:03,500
Scott: Yes, those things are not the greatest.

136
00:10:03,721 --> 00:10:05,130
Rym: They were hacks at best.

137
00:10:05,211 --> 00:10:06,620
Rym: Yeah, and not that they weren't awesome.

138
00:10:08,081 --> 00:10:10,189
Scott: Well automatic Oh easy Ubuntu is okay.

139
00:10:10,249 --> 00:10:11,153
Scott: automatics not so much.

140
00:10:11,213 --> 00:10:13,019
Rym: Yeah automatics cause some problems for me.

141
00:10:13,782 --> 00:10:15,267
Scott: Yeah, it caused some problems for a lot of people.

142
00:10:15,488 --> 00:10:15,689
Rym: Yeah.

143
00:10:16,171 --> 00:10:20,105
Scott: All right, my news it just sort of this general news This general news is that?

144
00:10:20,206 --> 00:10:20,949
Scott: well, let's see.

145
00:10:21,069 --> 00:10:22,214
Scott: We're putting this out Monday night.

146
00:10:22,475 --> 00:10:23,800
Scott: Most people listen on Tuesday.

147
00:10:24,302 --> 00:10:26,531
Scott: Tuesday is another Steve Jobs day.

148
00:10:26,552 --> 00:10:27,255
Rym: Oh boy.

149
00:10:27,415 --> 00:10:27,757
Scott: Oh shit.

150
00:10:27,797 --> 00:10:37,809
Scott: It's also the consumer electronic show perhaps the biggest trade show of electronics Everything computers everything.

151
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:44,380
Scott: well consumer electronics, right and It's happening now in Las Vegas and tomorrow the show floor opens up.

152
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:48,679
Scott: So we got Steve Jobs at Macworld and we got CES at the same time.

153
00:10:49,161 --> 00:10:53,958
Scott: So half of the tech reporters in the world are at Macworld and the other half are at CES.

154
00:10:54,018 --> 00:10:59,635
Scott: and this week You're gonna see some crazy crazy tech news some Apple goodies some everything.

155
00:10:59,716 --> 00:11:14,339
Scott: there have been a lot of rumors Announcing ranging from God ranging from like I don't know Rick in Mac phones that work with any carrier to like tablets and God knows what crazy shit people come up with.

156
00:11:14,359 --> 00:11:25,780
Rym: Yeah we're not even gonna get into that because there I mean the rumors about Apple stuff or to the point where they're just insane and Most of them are not true ever and it's just this crazy thing that you really shouldn't care about.

157
00:11:26,341 --> 00:11:38,500
Scott: Yeah, I never really understood the people who like pay attention to the rumors of what's gonna go down because number one sure Sometimes it's right, but but you don't know if it's right or wrong before it happens.

158
00:11:38,721 --> 00:11:42,036
Scott: So what it's a knowing a day earlier doesn't do anything for you.

159
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:45,460
Rym: You know, it's Yeah, and it's not like this speculation.

160
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:52,779
Rym: It's not like people are saying like I think Apple's gonna do this like when the Nintendo with the Wii There was a lot of speculation as to what they were gonna name it.

161
00:11:53,221 --> 00:11:58,400
Rym: There was a lot of speculation as to what was gonna happen, but the Apple people they don't seem to speculate so much.

162
00:11:58,441 --> 00:12:03,030
Rym: It's just make shit up and then believe it like I imagine a feedback loop.

163
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:14,364
Rym: or one guy just kind of says that they're gonna make a phone and Then it goes through ten friends and then one of his friends like in another state calls him says I heard Apple's making the phone And he thinks to himself I knew it.

164
00:12:15,127 --> 00:12:30,760
Scott: and people are so crazy to like find out this piece of information like I heard people saying stuff like Yeah, they have to print up all these banners before Mac world and then after the keynote they take covers off all the banners.

165
00:12:31,322 --> 00:12:36,499
Scott: So if we go to the printer, we'll be able to see what's they're printing on those banners and we'll know what they're gonna release.

166
00:12:38,422 --> 00:12:42,980
Scott: And I'm like, okay, you're not gonna be able to get this freaking product any sooner.

167
00:12:43,441 --> 00:12:54,940
Scott: I mean even if you knew what they were gonna show you tomorrow two days ago It's not gonna bring the release date forward you're not suddenly gonna get it for cheaper or you're not gonna get two of them.

168
00:12:55,421 --> 00:12:59,553
Rym: Why don't we just sell like Steve Jobs fingernail clippings on eBay?

169
00:12:59,573 --> 00:13:02,200
Scott: I don't know cuz it's hard to talk to the guy.

170
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,269
Scott: I mean, no one talks to him.

171
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:04,440
Rym: They don't need to be real.

172
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:16,265
Scott: Yeah, but you know look this this week if you're interested in buying a new phone or a computer Or anything.

173
00:13:16,285 --> 00:13:24,680
Scott: there's all sorts of new things coming out that are gonna be real interesting And you should definitely wait until next week before making any technology purchasing decisions.

174
00:13:24,941 --> 00:13:30,799
Rym: Yes, now no one from the GeekNights staff is obviously going to be flying out there to Las Vegas or California.

175
00:13:30,939 --> 00:13:41,319
Rym: Yes However, if any of our loyal listeners in the area want to in any way report on this for us I can practically guarantee we'll read or play whatever you send us.

176
00:13:41,581 --> 00:13:45,560
Scott: Yeah, but most likely we'll just go to engage it calm and read whatever they write.

177
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:48,012
Scott: Oh, yeah, because they got everything covered there.

178
00:13:48,032 --> 00:13:51,050
Rym: I mean nice to have some first-hand Reporting they.

179
00:13:51,171 --> 00:13:52,320
Scott: it is first-handed in gadget.

180
00:13:53,421 --> 00:13:55,667
Rym: Well first hand exclusive from us.

181
00:13:55,808 --> 00:13:56,991
Rym: I mean and gadgets.

182
00:13:57,051 --> 00:13:59,859
Scott: It's kind of hard to be exclusive but in gadget covers every.

183
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:08,680
Rym: no No, the news itself wouldn't be exclusive But the guy talking would be exclusive to us And gadgets not gonna pick up on our listener talking about the thing.

184
00:14:09,841 --> 00:14:14,020
Scott: Unless in gadget listens to GeekNights, which I doubt I don't know you'd be surprised.

185
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:20,286
Rym: I mean Katsucon listened to GeekNights and we didn't realize that till after I got back from a Katsucon I'm pretty sure engage.

186
00:14:20,346 --> 00:14:22,620
Scott: It doesn't listen to you guys cuz they don't respond to my emails.

187
00:14:23,283 --> 00:14:24,830
Rym: I don't think they respond to any emails.

188
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:35,343
Scott: No, they do sometimes on their podcast Things of the day.

189
00:14:35,364 --> 00:14:46,090
Rym: Oh So many of you might remember especially if you're in our general age group that back in the early 90s There was a show called tiny tunes that many of us watched.

190
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:47,395
Scott: Well, you know tiny tunes.

191
00:14:47,496 --> 00:14:52,457
Scott: actually when it first came out like I saw like, you know ads for it Like watch tiny tunes and I was like whatever.

192
00:14:52,497 --> 00:14:53,542
Scott: I'm not watching that crap.

193
00:14:54,084 --> 00:14:58,085
Scott: and then I guess eventually one day I watched it by accident and then I kept watching it.

194
00:14:58,286 --> 00:14:58,930
Rym: See I knew it was good.

195
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:01,361
Rym: I watched it for a long time pretty much from the moment.

196
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:01,783
Rym: It started.

197
00:15:01,843 --> 00:15:03,230
Rym: I like that show a lot to this day.

198
00:15:03,331 --> 00:15:04,758
Rym: I could still watch it and enjoy it.

199
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:06,789
Scott: Yeah, what was the best part of tiny tunes for you?

200
00:15:07,471 --> 00:15:14,091
Rym: Well, I think the best part of tiny tunes for me was the same best part for many people in the demographic listening to this Show.

201
00:15:14,111 --> 00:15:18,830
Rym: you see there was one episode where they did a bunch of music videos.

202
00:15:18,991 --> 00:15:19,817
Scott: Oh, that's not the best part.

203
00:15:19,837 --> 00:15:21,469
Scott: The best part is wacky land with the dodo bird.

204
00:15:22,651 --> 00:15:23,718
Scott: Okay, that's right.

205
00:15:24,322 --> 00:15:25,550
Scott: Anyone who disagrees me is wrong.

206
00:15:26,274 --> 00:15:37,482
Rym: So anyway for everyone who disagrees with Scott There was an episode of why way back where they did a bunch of music videos and two of these music videos were to - I'm Sure, they're actually two different music video episodes.

207
00:15:37,502 --> 00:15:51,755
Rym: there were in fact But two of the music videos that are most remembered were both - they might be giant songs particle man and my thing of the day here the complete music video - Istanbul not Constantinople.

208
00:15:58,693 --> 00:16:12,269
Rym: I Just think I remember going through RIT and every now and then this song would come up and without fail Most people around us would bring up that episode of tiny tunes or if they might be Giants ever came up.

209
00:16:12,711 --> 00:16:16,650
Rym: That song would come up followed by a mention of that episode of tiny tunes.

210
00:16:17,132 --> 00:16:20,004
Scott: It is weird because I before I had seen the episode.

211
00:16:20,024 --> 00:16:22,173
Scott: I somehow knew the song Right.

212
00:16:22,617 --> 00:16:24,127
Rym: Well, the song is old as hell.

213
00:16:30,052 --> 00:16:30,694
Scott: I know it's like.

214
00:16:30,714 --> 00:16:33,444
Scott: I knew the song like, you know twinkle twinkle little star.

215
00:16:33,544 --> 00:16:36,590
Scott: and then I saw the episode and I was like Ah, there's that song now.

216
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:43,970
Scott: I had a grasp on what they were saying in the song But I didn't know they might be Giants or anything for I thought they were saying instead of Turks.

217
00:16:44,091 --> 00:16:44,959
Rym: I thought it was jerks.

218
00:16:45,221 --> 00:16:46,170
Scott: No, I did too.

219
00:16:47,705 --> 00:16:53,329
Rym: But I didn't realize at first when I saw this that they might be Giants was a real band and I thought it was.

220
00:16:53,349 --> 00:16:59,503
Rym: this is joke song for the show and It percolated in my mind cuz particle man and Istanbul just kind of.

221
00:16:59,944 --> 00:17:01,430
Rym: there were catchy weird songs.

222
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:02,596
Rym: They weren't really like the music.

223
00:17:02,636 --> 00:17:03,501
Rym: I listened to at the time.

224
00:17:03,561 --> 00:17:04,385
Rym: I won't go into the music.

225
00:17:04,425 --> 00:17:09,530
Rym: I listened to at the time mostly Michael Jackson and hair metal crisscross.

226
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:14,566
Rym: I live I not only did I listen to crisscross, but I went to a crisscross concert.

227
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:17,630
Scott: No shit It was okay.

228
00:17:19,394 --> 00:17:20,126
Scott: Boys to men.

229
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:28,689
Rym: Yeah 90s, oh the 90s which were infinitely better than the 80s which were infinitely worse than the 70s.

230
00:17:30,212 --> 00:17:31,470
Rym: Indeed, right.

231
00:17:31,992 --> 00:17:38,373
Rym: So this is just that complete music video and I hope that many of you share the deep sense of nostalgia That I have.

232
00:17:39,035 --> 00:17:44,812
Rym: and also I'll just note that it was because of this that I discovered they might be Giants and became a fan From that day.

233
00:17:44,893 --> 00:17:45,414
Rym: docents.

234
00:17:45,996 --> 00:17:50,450
Scott: Yeah, I didn't actually realize I didn't pay attention actually who sung songs when I was that age.

235
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:53,270
Scott: So I didn't know they might be Giants for quite a while.

236
00:17:53,672 --> 00:18:07,124
Rym: I didn't either until I was talking to people at school one day and I was like Hey tiny tunes that song and one kid was like, yeah it's this band called they might be Giants and I checked him out and I didn't buy a CD or anything because I didn't buy.

237
00:18:07,144 --> 00:18:08,109
Rym: so that was even before mp3s.

238
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:10,326
Rym: I just thought CDs were a ripoff even back then.

239
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,997
Scott: Remember in CDs they didn't come in jewel cases.

240
00:18:13,017 --> 00:18:18,779
Scott: they came in these big frickin things with all sorts of stuff on them Yeah, and all sorts of extra crap inside.

241
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:25,950
Scott: you didn't want little lyrics books and posters I don't know like like just plastic to protect it like we're covered in crap.

242
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:29,086
Scott: Yeah, like when DVDs first came out they were just covered in stuff.

243
00:18:29,106 --> 00:18:29,388
Scott: Remember when?

244
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,344
Scott: Cassette tapes had a big plastic thing on it.

245
00:18:32,384 --> 00:18:33,310
Scott: So they were hard to steal.

246
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:43,369
Rym: No I remember when I got a Michael Jackson CD and it had the crappiest tiniest Folded up pre-ruined poster of Michael Jackson I've ever seen.

247
00:18:43,952 --> 00:18:48,769
Rym: Yeah, just fold it up and kind of shoved into this giant plastic monstrosity that held the CD.

248
00:18:50,318 --> 00:18:55,362
Scott: man Yeah before Napster and then tiny tunes went away.

249
00:18:55,482 --> 00:19:00,703
Scott: We had an animaniacs, which is just as good but different Yep, and now there's nothing nothing like that anymore.

250
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:02,170
Rym: I mean, I guess now we just watch anime.

251
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:05,647
Scott: It's like we had the actual Looney Tunes then we had the tiny tunes and the animaniacs.

252
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:06,170
Scott: now nothing.

253
00:19:06,491 --> 00:19:10,829
Scott: So my thing today just a funny YouTube video because I'm lazy and it made me laugh.

254
00:19:12,431 --> 00:19:13,434
Rym: Yeah, it's hilarious.

255
00:19:13,454 --> 00:19:13,976
Rym: What can I say?

256
00:19:14,116 --> 00:19:18,690
Scott: Yeah, you got this guy's obviously some sort of medical doctor student or something.

257
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:24,890
Scott: Maybe he's training to be a forensic guy or whatever and he's practicing an autopsy and he explains the autopsy.

258
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:30,440
Scott: He's gonna practice something to do with removing arteries or veins or I don't even know because he talks in doctor talk.

259
00:19:31,931 --> 00:19:35,330
Rym: You're like, you know those dogs like blah blah blah blah mittens blah blah.

260
00:19:35,691 --> 00:19:39,025
Rym: I guess we heard blah blah blah blah veins blah blah.

261
00:19:39,065 --> 00:19:40,130
Scott: That's pretty much what it was.

262
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:44,242
Scott: yeah, and he's that he's sitting next to this dead body on a table.

263
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:51,785
Scott: the body's dead and He's looking at this camera and he's describing as calmly as any doctor.

264
00:19:51,825 --> 00:19:53,029
Scott: would you know what he's about to do?

265
00:19:53,049 --> 00:20:05,389
Scott: and then he's about to get to work and the hand of the dead body move goes up and goes down again and the guy reacts in a Classic and genuine way and I won't tell you.

266
00:20:06,552 --> 00:20:07,698
Scott: You know the secret to that.

267
00:20:07,718 --> 00:20:08,602
Scott: you can watch the video.

268
00:20:08,904 --> 00:20:10,150
Scott: Yeah, and that'll be the funny part.

269
00:20:12,831 --> 00:20:18,009
Rym: All I have to say is that guy implemented one of the proper protocols for dealing with a possible zombie attack.

270
00:20:19,016 --> 00:20:19,742
Scott: Oh, it is true.

271
00:20:19,762 --> 00:20:25,370
Rym: protocol number one If a dead body moves get the fuck out and figure out what happened later.

272
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:26,938
Scott: See, I don't know why.

273
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,109
Scott: here's the thing that they messed up though, right?

274
00:20:29,411 --> 00:20:42,342
Scott: While he had the proper reaction to the zombie attack the possible zombie attack he did not have the Necessary, how do you say preparedness for a zombie attack?

275
00:20:42,382 --> 00:20:42,603
Rym: Yes.

276
00:20:42,663 --> 00:20:47,835
Scott: I mean if you're in a morgue or a Corpse storage facility.

277
00:20:48,196 --> 00:20:50,983
Scott: There should be shotguns and glass things on the wall.

278
00:20:51,304 --> 00:20:58,455
Rym: at least a Louisville slugger at least Crowbars worked it cuz for all we know he was on his way to get it Could have been he could have been.

279
00:20:58,816 --> 00:21:02,650
Rym: I love how when the prank is over the perpetrators of the prank say something to the effective.

280
00:21:02,773 --> 00:21:03,306
Rym: Where'd he go?

281
00:21:04,433 --> 00:21:05,913
Scott: All right Right.

282
00:21:05,954 --> 00:21:16,450
Rym: So today we're this is kind of a geek back But it turns into a whole episode and we're not gonna read The questions that spawned this because we have had I think three or four people ask us things along these lines.

283
00:21:16,531 --> 00:21:17,689
Rym: So we're gonna cover them all at once.

284
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:30,331
Scott: Yeah, a lot of our listeners are in the late high school age category and a lot of people aren't but this might be interesting To you anyway, and they often ask us because I was a CS major and now I am a BS and CS And

285
00:21:30,391 --> 00:21:32,859
Rym: I was an IT major and I'm now a BS in IT

286
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:39,529
Scott: and they say I'm going to college and I like computers But there are so many computer majors, which one do I do?

287
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,575
Scott: So we said hey Let's do this really easy.

288
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:49,635
Scott: show that doesn't take a lot of effort and we'll tell people what all the different computer technology majors are now.

289
00:21:49,716 --> 00:21:50,037
Rym: first off.

290
00:21:50,298 --> 00:21:56,089
Rym: use the right one if you don't know any of this and You really have no idea what we're talking about and you're gonna learn a lot from it.

291
00:21:56,692 --> 00:22:04,700
Rym: Don't be ashamed at all because when I went to RIT before I was a student I didn't even know there were majors other than computer science.

292
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,405
Scott: Yeah, I mean, here's a big the biggest.

293
00:22:07,107 --> 00:22:15,806
Scott: the problem here Is that when people are getting ready to go to college if they decide to go to college Which is a debate for another time whether you should go to college or not.

294
00:22:16,007 --> 00:22:16,630
Scott: We can leave that.

295
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:21,649
Scott: We'll just assume you're decided to go already because that's for another show entirely a Thursday show.

296
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:28,170
Scott: One of the people you go to that knows shit is your guidance counselor in high school.

297
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:31,570
Rym: Well, well knows shit, I guess should have some quotes around it.

298
00:22:31,792 --> 00:22:37,880
Scott: I know I meant it quite literally and That guidance counselor is someone that is often trusted to know about these things.

299
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,384
Scott: because well, that's their job.

300
00:22:39,564 --> 00:22:48,030
Rym: now to paraphrase many famous comedic quotes Why are you taking career advice from someone who ended up being a guidance counselor in your local high school?

301
00:22:48,317 --> 00:22:51,295
Scott: Exactly Anyway, guidance counselors.

302
00:22:51,677 --> 00:22:56,750
Scott: Most of them don't know that much about technology because if they did they wouldn't be guidance counselors.

303
00:22:57,831 --> 00:23:01,722
Scott: So when you say hey, I like computers, what major should I pick?

304
00:23:02,103 --> 00:23:04,128
Scott: They have no freaking clue 90% of the time.

305
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:08,837
Rym: They'll probably say computer science MIT I'm pretty sure they're.

306
00:23:08,877 --> 00:23:12,310
Scott: you know, there are guidance counselors out there who must know there must be good guidance counselors.

307
00:23:12,471 --> 00:23:16,989
Scott: But in my experience, I've never met any my guidance counselor in middle school.

308
00:23:17,212 --> 00:23:26,149
Rym: Bad guidance counselor in middle school told me to slack off in school because my extra brains weren't gonna get me anywhere and I shouldn't Worry about it, right?

309
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:35,943
Scott: Anyway, the most guidance counselors end up telling you just take computer science because that's all they know and a lot of people end up Going in and applying to schools for computer science.

310
00:23:36,325 --> 00:23:37,349
Scott: Well, that's not what they want to do.

311
00:23:37,611 --> 00:23:39,069
Scott: No, I don't want to do computer science at all.

312
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:49,110
Rym: Not only do you not want to do the computer science possibly but if you haven't already done some prep work Some of the computer majors are pretty much already out of the question.

313
00:23:49,419 --> 00:23:49,584
Scott: Mm-hmm.

314
00:23:49,870 --> 00:24:03,785
Rym: like if you go into a school at least a good tech school and you want to be a computer science major or an IT major or Computer engineering major and you don't already know some things You're pretty much fucked and unless you're really smart.

315
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:07,629
Rym: Yes, but It's been my experience that most people are not.

316
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:25,150
Scott: For example RIT where we went tells you and they don't lie Technically that you could become a computer science major at RIT If you have never seen a computer before in your entire life And you don't even need to own a computer in order to be a computer science major at RIT and pass.

317
00:24:26,316 --> 00:24:41,609
Scott: It's true you could possibly pass and get a bachelor's degree in computer science at RIT never having seen a computer before in your life and Not owning a computer ever even while you're at RIT and only using the computers in the lab dot dot dot.

318
00:24:42,171 --> 00:24:46,186
Rym: If you are the rain man when it comes to computers and technology

319
00:24:46,307 --> 00:24:52,053
Scott: if you put in Incredible amounts of effort and are very very smart then yes Otherwise no

320
00:24:52,294 --> 00:24:53,698
Rym: and even that it'll suck to

321
00:24:53,798 --> 00:25:11,670
Scott: reasonably pass and get a degree in computer science from any legitimate tech school or legitimate secondary education Provider in the whole country in the whole world You need to have programmed a computer before you get there or else you're going to be very very lost.

322
00:25:12,091 --> 00:25:20,868
Rym: now this seems to be part of a growing problem and I guess it part of is that there we were kind of at the End of the Golden Age of being forced to learn about computers in order to use them.

323
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:23,603
Rym: now I'm not saying the computers should be hard to use.

324
00:25:23,684 --> 00:25:24,650
Rym: don't get me wrong.

325
00:25:25,091 --> 00:25:31,290
Rym: The fact that we have gooeys now and that Windows just most part just works and that there's desktop Linux is great.

326
00:25:31,872 --> 00:25:37,109
Rym: I am not saying we should go back to the old shit days when ICQ would crash and I didn't know why.

327
00:25:38,391 --> 00:25:47,230
Rym: but We grew up at the end of the era where to make anything work on any computer Other than max and even max had their own quirks.

328
00:25:47,772 --> 00:25:53,136
Rym: You had to do a lot and you had to learn a lot and most of what I knew about Computers going into school.

329
00:25:53,156 --> 00:26:00,310
Rym: I had learned from the fact that software just didn't work Period and you had to do a lot to make it work by a sound card.

330
00:26:00,551 --> 00:26:04,950
Rym: You had to learn about IRQs and DMAs and slots in the computer by RAM.

331
00:26:05,271 --> 00:26:08,970
Rym: You had to learn all about BIOS is by a hard drive you're fucked.

332
00:26:09,592 --> 00:26:10,435
Scott: Yeah, you know.

333
00:26:10,977 --> 00:26:13,265
Scott: before us people had to know even more.

334
00:26:13,386 --> 00:26:16,980
Scott: when you had a Commodore 64 You had to know a lot about computers if you wanted to.

335
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,622
Scott: I don't know.

336
00:26:17,763 --> 00:26:19,128
Scott: make your modem work and get on a BBS.

337
00:26:20,052 --> 00:26:28,190
Scott: so just by the virtue of people being computer users and using Computers when they were very primitive relatively primitive.

338
00:26:29,271 --> 00:26:31,038
Scott: They had to know a lot about computers.

339
00:26:31,178 --> 00:26:35,190
Scott: So if they ended up liking technology going to college They're prepared.

340
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:48,070
Scott: Nowadays, if you're a myspace I am kid, you know, browses the web and looks at YouTube videos You know how to make word art in Microsoft Word and maybe you can Photoshop some cool pics on your deviant arts.

341
00:26:49,414 --> 00:26:53,258
Scott: You are not prepared at all For any sort of computer major.

342
00:26:53,800 --> 00:27:03,095
Rym: So before we begin my only advice is In the very least take some sort of Linux CD put it in a computer and try to futz with it Computer and fix it.

343
00:27:03,196 --> 00:27:03,758
Rym: try thing.

344
00:27:03,939 --> 00:27:10,010
Scott: if you want to go to college for computers Learn as much as you can about computers before going there.

345
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:12,039
Scott: Maybe go take classes at community college.

346
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:13,083
Scott: if there's a smart guy there.

347
00:27:13,144 --> 00:27:15,875
Scott: some community colleges have smart Programming classes.

348
00:27:16,297 --> 00:27:19,770
Scott: if you're if your high school has any sort of computer class take all of them.

349
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:22,726
Scott: I did even though I ended up teaching the class once or twice.

350
00:27:22,806 --> 00:27:23,108
Scott: Yeah.

351
00:27:23,188 --> 00:27:26,970
Scott: Yep I mean I even the height the computer science class in my high school were VB.

352
00:27:28,952 --> 00:27:29,796
Scott: What more can I say?

353
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:30,760
Rym: I didn't even have that.

354
00:27:30,981 --> 00:27:32,127
Scott: yeah, it was pretty sad.

355
00:27:32,147 --> 00:27:37,310
Rym: now We're not saying that if you don't have all this extensive knowledge, you can't go into these majors.

356
00:27:37,411 --> 00:27:47,788
Rym: just be warned that a Lot of times our friends accuse us of this a lot who weren't tech majors that we really trivialize our education at RIT and we always kind of joke about how easy it was.

357
00:27:47,808 --> 00:27:50,275
Rym: and Consider this.

358
00:27:50,556 --> 00:27:57,347
Rym: we basically spent a decade Give or take learning about computers before we even went to college.

359
00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:02,730
Scott: I First time I ever used a computer kindergarten and that day I wrote a program and logo.

360
00:28:03,191 --> 00:28:10,310
Rym: I remember in elementary school when I typed an essay in some terrible typesetting program and I was so proud of that thing.

361
00:28:10,771 --> 00:28:14,302
Scott: I didn't actually use any word processing until fifth grade, but I at that time.

362
00:28:14,342 --> 00:28:16,108
Scott: I also had a CD-ROM encyclopedia.

363
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:22,750
Rym: Oh But yeah, we we spent a long time learning about computers before we went to school.

364
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:26,601
Rym: So as a result going to RIT despite it being an extremely difficult school.

365
00:28:26,661 --> 00:28:30,012
Rym: I mean the failure rate is over 50% Mm-hmm.

366
00:28:30,233 --> 00:28:31,318
Rym: We it was easy.

367
00:28:31,378 --> 00:28:31,739
Scott: Well wasn't?

368
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:43,397
Scott: it also includes dropouts not just failures Yeah However, most dropouts for due to failing most or losing scholarships by having low GPAs or just quitting and going somewhere else Because you didn't like our 18.

369
00:28:43,397 --> 00:28:44,743
Rym: Yeah, mostly because it was very hard.

370
00:28:44,763 --> 00:28:45,627
Rym: You weren't doing very well.

371
00:28:45,908 --> 00:28:48,358
Rym: Yeah All right, so he's in the tech part.

372
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:51,370
Scott: The first major is the one I did which is computer science.

373
00:28:51,551 --> 00:28:52,656
Scott: What is computer science?

374
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:55,450
Scott: It is very specifically the science of computing.

375
00:28:56,233 --> 00:28:57,419
Rym: See the hit little history here.

376
00:28:57,479 --> 00:28:59,910
Rym: then we'll list all the majors and go into all of them in detail.

377
00:29:00,477 --> 00:29:07,890
Rym: computer science Originally was the only computer major really and they lumped everything involving computers into computer science.

378
00:29:08,713 --> 00:29:12,810
Rym: The reason there's confusion now is that guidance counselors are old and things change quick.

379
00:29:13,653 --> 00:29:17,688
Rym: It wasn't that long ago that the first IT program was formed at RIT.

380
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:21,960
Scott: I mean think about decades ago Biology was the major.

381
00:29:22,161 --> 00:29:33,250
Scott: now this molecular biology bioinformatics organic Whatnots and all kinds of biology majors genetic thingies, and I don't even know because I don't know enough about biology.

382
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:37,762
Rym: Yep, so computer science eventually split off information technology.

383
00:29:38,283 --> 00:29:40,509
Rym: now IT became kind of the catch-all.

384
00:29:40,991 --> 00:29:44,729
Rym: computer engineering split off from basically from CS and not from IT.

385
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:50,283
Rym: and Then software engineering split off from CS and then networking split off from IT.

386
00:29:50,424 --> 00:29:55,641
Scott: and there's like electronic engineering and micro Electronic engineering and all kinds of stuff.

387
00:29:55,722 --> 00:29:57,790
Rym: Yeah, but it used to all just be CS.

388
00:29:57,911 --> 00:29:59,586
Rym: So that's where most of the confusion comes from.

389
00:29:59,748 --> 00:30:01,575
Scott: Yep Anyway, computer science.

390
00:30:01,635 --> 00:30:06,990
Scott: if you take computer science today as your major you are going to be writing software.

391
00:30:07,492 --> 00:30:09,059
Scott: Who knows what kind of software you're gonna write?

392
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:11,670
Scott: You might be writing desktop applications like Microsoft Word.

393
00:30:12,252 --> 00:30:14,599
Scott: You might be writing web applications like dig.

394
00:30:15,121 --> 00:30:17,950
Scott: you might be writing drivers for Nvidia video cards.

395
00:30:18,332 --> 00:30:19,799
Scott: You might work on Linux kernel.

396
00:30:20,301 --> 00:30:22,030
Scott: You might be writing new computer languages.

397
00:30:22,592 --> 00:30:29,869
Scott: but whatever it is, you're going to be writing code whether it's PHP C sharp or assembler or something.

398
00:30:30,292 --> 00:30:33,310
Scott: Computer science is writing code of some sort.

399
00:30:33,771 --> 00:30:37,742
Scott: There's a lot of things in the world that need code written for them.

400
00:30:37,963 --> 00:30:38,906
Scott: Not just computers.

401
00:30:38,946 --> 00:30:44,336
Scott: You could write code for cell phones toasters toasters microwaves Code.

402
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:48,882
Scott: there is computer code Basically anything with an integrated circuit.

403
00:30:49,103 --> 00:30:50,630
Scott: you could be writing code for games.

404
00:30:51,131 --> 00:30:54,803
Scott: You could be writing code for the cash register at the pizza place.

405
00:30:55,244 --> 00:30:56,890
Scott: computer science people write code.

406
00:30:57,414 --> 00:31:02,205
Rym: So if you don't like writing code Stay the hell away from computer science.

407
00:31:02,225 --> 00:31:03,270
Rym: You will not be happy.

408
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:07,849
Scott: Yes compute and depending on which kind of computer science you do, you know where you take it.

409
00:31:08,312 --> 00:31:20,770
Scott: You might be doing some pretty hard maths or some other sort of stuff like if you want to write languages, you have to learn all about Grammars and language theory and there's some complex discrete maths going on in there.

410
00:31:21,111 --> 00:31:25,310
Scott: And if you want to do computer graphics, there's some calculus is going on in there.

411
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:28,069
Scott: If you write physics engines also some calculus is going on.

412
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:28,933
Rym: You need to know.

413
00:31:28,973 --> 00:31:29,214
Rym: you need.

414
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:32,910
Rym: you need to know a lot about logic and logical processes a lot about math.

415
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:42,513
Rym: You're gonna learn a lot of theory a lot of things like efficient sorting algorithms and object oriented programming versus Linear program.

416
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:51,337
Scott: Yeah, most nowadays object oriented programming is is pretty much the standard, you know design Methodology behind all the languages.

417
00:31:51,699 --> 00:31:59,389
Scott: So the first thing you're gonna learn in computer science classes is object oriented Principles and and such and design patterns and crap like that.

418
00:32:00,012 --> 00:32:03,670
Scott: So if you are thinking about being computer science you like writing code.

419
00:32:04,031 --> 00:32:12,233
Scott: You should probably know the basics of object oriented programming before going in or in the very least know something about Programming.

420
00:32:12,394 --> 00:32:15,490
Scott: Yeah, if you know basic you'll probably be alright actually.

421
00:32:16,032 --> 00:32:21,410
Rym: Yeah, because if you can program that way then when they tell you about object oriented programming you won't go.

422
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:22,093
Rym: What the hell is this?

423
00:32:22,113 --> 00:32:22,434
Rym: You'll go.

424
00:32:22,454 --> 00:32:24,462
Rym: Wow, that makes it a lot easier.

425
00:32:24,482 --> 00:32:33,444
Scott: Yeah, they spent like one day In about let's see in cs1 at RIT After about two class periods, which is two hours.

426
00:32:33,805 --> 00:32:42,525
Scott: They had already covered Everything that was in the basic programming language, which I already knew but for other people if you had never programmed before you just be like WTF mate.

427
00:32:43,992 --> 00:32:50,324
Scott: and they basically one of the required books for the First seat for cs1 was this Unix book.

428
00:32:50,364 --> 00:32:51,249
Scott: That wasn't so great.

429
00:32:51,773 --> 00:33:05,282
Scott: But if you didn't already know how to use Unix Linux Solaris or any other kind of Nix operating system and that's what they use there and any good school is going to use some sort of Unix type operating system for all their programming action.

430
00:33:05,884 --> 00:33:07,068
Scott: You're gonna have a trouble.

431
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:19,826
Rym: Yeah I mean it won't be like oh you won't be able to do the assignments but it'll be problems like if you don't know about Linux you won't know how to Make a shell into the campus code computer from your dorms.

432
00:33:19,846 --> 00:33:20,890
Rym: You don't have to go to class.

433
00:33:21,392 --> 00:33:27,990
Rym: You won't know how to back your stuff up or run tests on the super fast Cluster that's sitting over in the computer science department.

434
00:33:28,191 --> 00:33:33,265
Scott: Yeah, you won't know how to send an email from the command line when you know or anything like.

435
00:33:33,305 --> 00:33:34,930
Scott: you'll be pretty you'll be pretty lost.

436
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:37,040
Rym: You will tell you to use CVS and you'll go what?

437
00:33:37,483 --> 00:33:37,844
Scott: Yeah.

438
00:33:38,025 --> 00:33:38,910
Rym: Yeah, that's not good.

439
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:51,096
Scott: You're gonna have to learn a lot of things beyond just coding if you don't already know about Linux And if you go to a school that's not using Unix or Linux or whatever on its computer science machines Probably not the greatest school.

440
00:33:51,176 --> 00:33:51,377
Rym: Yes.

441
00:33:51,477 --> 00:33:59,446
Scott: I mean, I'm sure they'll probably have a Windows lab and maybe a Mac lab But they're mostly gonna be concentrating on some sort of Nick's thing.

442
00:33:59,527 --> 00:34:02,568
Rym: if they're a good school I think we'll split off into a separate show.

443
00:34:03,111 --> 00:34:08,250
Rym: Talk about like what makes a good CS IT whatever program versus a bad one and which schools to go to.

444
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:11,159
Rym: That sounds cool because I could do a whole separate thing about that.

445
00:34:11,261 --> 00:34:11,440
Scott: Yep.

446
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:13,047
Rym: But yeah CS.

447
00:34:13,208 --> 00:34:21,922
Rym: very briefly I don't know RIT MIT Caltech Carnegie Mellon Rose-Hulman Uh, yeah places like that Georgia Tech.

448
00:34:21,942 --> 00:34:24,350
Scott: All right now someone related with the word tech.

449
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:26,757
Rym: Yes related to a CS.

450
00:34:26,818 --> 00:34:27,438
Rym: very much.

451
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,101
Rym: So we'll do that.

452
00:34:28,161 --> 00:34:32,715
Rym: next is something called software engineering Mmm software engineering.

453
00:34:32,755 --> 00:34:40,560
Scott: now you got to understand that in the world where people are doing work programming They work mostly in teams on big projects.

454
00:34:41,303 --> 00:34:52,753
Scott: and when you have a big project and a team You know, everyone does a small part of a big program, you know When you write a program by yourself you map you design it and then you write all the parts and then you make them Work together

455
00:34:52,813 --> 00:34:55,266
Rym: and it's always usually something very small or trivial.

456
00:34:55,286 --> 00:34:55,668
Rym: Mm-hmm

457
00:34:56,469 --> 00:35:11,842
Scott: When you have so such a big project that so many that like 30 people need to work on it together Then you need someone, you know who can plan all this out and say alright you do this part you do this part you do This part this is how these parts are gonna work together.

458
00:35:11,903 --> 00:35:17,390
Scott: These are these parts are gonna work together You know, they got to see the big picture, you know, they got to know how to code.

459
00:35:17,711 --> 00:35:28,290
Scott: But mostly they got to look at the big picture and figure out how these things are gonna Fit and work together so that all these other people can work separately and then all their work can be combined into one thing.

460
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:36,383
Scott: And it's got to be done efficiently, you know, you don't want to have people wasting time coding, you know And all this sorts of the process sort of stuff.

461
00:35:36,544 --> 00:35:44,946
Rym: Yeah, you're gonna learn a lot more Abstract theory not as much of the math but a lot more things like process theory software design cycle stuff.

462
00:35:45,046 --> 00:35:46,330
Rym: Yeah, you read that low management.

463
00:35:46,491 --> 00:35:48,782
Scott: Yeah, there's that famous book the mythical man month.

464
00:35:48,882 --> 00:35:50,510
Scott: That's all about software engineering.

465
00:35:50,791 --> 00:35:51,393
Scott: That's what that is.

466
00:35:51,474 --> 00:35:55,470
Rym: to make a nice analogy computer science say that we're talking about a symphony Orchestra.

467
00:35:56,130 --> 00:36:00,549
Rym: Computer science are the people who play the instruments or write the music.

468
00:36:01,212 --> 00:36:03,159
Rym: Sometimes they'll be playing or sometimes they figure out.

469
00:36:03,179 --> 00:36:06,070
Scott: they study music theory and they learn about music itself.

470
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:09,220
Rym: Yes, but they're mostly writing the music and possibly playing the music.

471
00:36:09,782 --> 00:36:13,052
Rym: The software engineer is like the conductor Mm-hmm.

472
00:36:13,273 --> 00:36:15,179
Rym: He is the one who is directing everyone.

473
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,383
Rym: you do this part.

474
00:36:16,443 --> 00:36:17,266
Rym: You do this part.

475
00:36:17,547 --> 00:36:18,390
Rym: You're going too slow.

476
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:19,297
Rym: You better speed up.

477
00:36:19,317 --> 00:36:20,103
Rym: You're going too fast.

478
00:36:20,124 --> 00:36:20,869
Rym: You better slow down.

479
00:36:21,153 --> 00:36:34,805
Scott: It's also the guy who you know who will take the music theory that computer science has just figured out and then apply it to design a large project and then Distribute all the pieces of the design to little worker monkeys who will make those parts.

480
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:38,477
Rym: and I think to simplify the analogy We'll just we'll consider just a performance.

481
00:36:38,677 --> 00:36:42,470
Rym: Yeah, so computer science playing the instruments software engineering conducting.

482
00:36:42,711 --> 00:36:52,330
Rym: Yep, now we'll get into my major because it follows right along information technology Which is a relatively recent major and it's relatively broad.

483
00:36:52,498 --> 00:36:59,750
Rym: Yes You see it started at RIT actually and it is basically the catch-all for all the cracks of computing.

484
00:37:00,753 --> 00:37:16,593
Rym: IT jobs range from system administrator to network administrator Network architect database admin helpdesk tech support computer repair consulting project management Management.

485
00:37:17,115 --> 00:37:20,590
Rym: IT is pretty much everything that isn't covered by another computer major.

486
00:37:21,091 --> 00:37:27,410
Scott: Yeah, every other computer manager is usually involved in making computers or making computers do stuff.

487
00:37:27,976 --> 00:37:34,350
Scott: Information technology Those are the people who know a lot about computers so that they can use them.

488
00:37:34,551 --> 00:37:38,890
Scott: They use all the stuff that everyone else makes in, you know, but they're not users.

489
00:37:39,693 --> 00:37:44,470
Rym: Yes, and IT is very broad and most other majors like CS or software engineering.

490
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:48,763
Rym: You might have concentrations and you'll specialize in things like in computer science.

491
00:37:48,783 --> 00:37:53,030
Rym: some people specialize in like artificial intelligence But they still learn all the fundamentals.

492
00:37:53,852 --> 00:37:56,560
Rym: The IT fundamentals are very very broad.

493
00:37:57,101 --> 00:38:04,423
Rym: and then you specialize in a number of areas like for example I specialized in network administration system administration things like that.

494
00:38:04,985 --> 00:38:07,252
Rym: You could specialize in database administration Security.

495
00:38:07,513 --> 00:38:18,950
Rym: Yep, they're there so I couldn't even list all of them, but you basically pick a bunch of directions you want to go Specialize in those so you get depth in a few areas and breadth on every other topic in computing.

496
00:38:19,815 --> 00:38:24,637
Rym: Now the biggest myth about IT is that you don't write code And that fucks a lot of people.

497
00:38:24,657 --> 00:38:27,830
Rym: a lot of people find out that you know computer science got no calculus.

498
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:28,395
Rym: it's hard.

499
00:38:28,415 --> 00:38:35,170
Rym: you got a code they go to IT and Then one of their first classes is Java and they got to write a whole bunch of code and learn it.

500
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:36,677
Scott: I mean, it's not like.

501
00:38:36,777 --> 00:38:38,284
Scott: it's not really right now.

502
00:38:38,385 --> 00:38:46,190
Scott: It's basically like if you Already knew basic and then you were going into CS you had already met the requirements of code writing in IT.

503
00:38:46,612 --> 00:38:55,410
Scott: The problem is when you had these people who had never written code in their lives They go into IT thinking it's just all the stuff they've used to installing software and partitioning drives and building computers.

504
00:38:55,531 --> 00:38:56,856
Rym: Yeah, those are so basic there.

505
00:38:56,896 --> 00:38:59,648
Scott: and then they have to learn basic and they're like, oh shit.

506
00:38:59,889 --> 00:39:00,954
Rym: Yep I mean IT.

507
00:39:01,456 --> 00:39:03,846
Rym: you'll learn a little bit of everything.

508
00:39:03,926 --> 00:39:17,210
Rym: You won't be a coder You won't be writing code for your job but you'll learn enough code to look at code and understand what it does and You'll know at least I need code that does X and then you would know how to ask a CS major to make that code.

509
00:39:17,331 --> 00:39:24,833
Scott: Yeah, or if like you're an administrator You'll be able to write yourself a little script to help you do fancy stuff instead of needing a programmer to make it for You like.

510
00:39:24,873 --> 00:39:31,800
Rym: and one thing you will do a lot of is scripting which technically it's coding But it's definitely in a different scale.

511
00:39:31,861 --> 00:39:33,970
Rym: scripting is like I have a computer.

512
00:39:34,674 --> 00:39:37,630
Rym: I need to periodically back up all these files.

513
00:39:38,192 --> 00:39:42,869
Rym: I write a little Python script that automatically does that for me categorizes them all and does whatever.

514
00:39:43,771 --> 00:39:44,152
Rym: You're right.

515
00:39:44,312 --> 00:39:49,409
Rym: useful short utilities that are often replicated all over the internet to make your life easier.

516
00:39:50,314 --> 00:39:50,516
Scott: Mm-hmm.

517
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:59,813
Rym: now IT Just I guess the only real thing I want to warn people is that IT is not Easier than CS as though like a lot of people think it is It's just different.

518
00:40:00,376 --> 00:40:06,776
Rym: and if you go into IT thinking that you'll make the same money as all these other computer people But not learn as much you're in for a failure.

519
00:40:06,796 --> 00:40:20,423
Scott: Yeah Administrator is a terrible job, and it's boring and it's it's really bad But you there is an opportunity to make a lot of money doing that.

520
00:40:20,744 --> 00:40:21,989
Scott: if you only care about money.

521
00:40:22,591 --> 00:40:31,686
Scott: Go by all means become a database administrator and learn everything you can about Oracle and Postgres and all that jazz And you will become a very wealthy person most likely.

522
00:40:31,706 --> 00:40:38,396
Rym: yep in fact RIT tried to convince me to go into databases, and I took the intro to databases class Promptly said fuck this.

523
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:39,600
Rym: and never took another database.

524
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:42,310
Scott: class databases from the perspective of programmer.

525
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:56,950
Scott: Just writing some PHP SQL is kind of okay from the perspective of a guy who has to manage a giant cluster of Oracle machines and Optimize the database and keep it running and make sure it doesn't fuck up, and that is a bad job.

526
00:40:57,451 --> 00:41:12,069
Rym: So in the performing Symphony Orchestra analogy the IT people are the ones who sell the tickets at the counter manage the crowd Announce the band clean the instruments arrange the chairs and give the conductor his little wand.

527
00:41:12,309 --> 00:41:16,369
Rym: yeah They pretty much do all the stuff that isn't covered by other people's jobs.

528
00:41:16,852 --> 00:41:18,239
Scott: I think you're taking the analogy a little too far.

529
00:41:18,501 --> 00:41:19,727
Rym: I'm gonna keep going with analogy.

530
00:41:19,747 --> 00:41:20,210
Rym: I got more.

531
00:41:20,512 --> 00:41:22,407
Scott: Alright, who do we have next?

532
00:41:22,447 --> 00:41:22,588
Scott: well?

533
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:27,550
Scott: Computer engineering alright, so it's pretty simple computer engineering.

534
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:28,757
Scott: You know those video cards.

535
00:41:28,798 --> 00:41:30,769
Scott: you buy those Nvidia video cards.

536
00:41:31,412 --> 00:41:36,670
Scott: Well compute this the Nvidia chip on their computer engineers don't make that they just buy that from Nvidia.

537
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:39,599
Scott: There's the Nvidia driver.

538
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,269
Scott: nope computer scientists make that.

539
00:41:42,251 --> 00:41:44,259
Scott: Well, what did the computer engineers do?

540
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,869
Scott: they take the board they put the chip on it?

541
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:50,163
Scott: They design where all the stuff goes on the board.

542
00:41:50,303 --> 00:41:51,710
Scott: they put all the other stuff.

543
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:55,950
Scott: That's on there the little connectors and stuff, and then they put the firmware is on there.

544
00:41:56,353 --> 00:41:58,049
Scott: That's what a computer engineer does you take?

545
00:41:58,991 --> 00:42:01,941
Scott: Hardware bits and you put them together to make hardware things.

546
00:42:01,961 --> 00:42:04,954
Scott: You know you need someone to make a Motherboard.

547
00:42:04,974 --> 00:42:06,730
Scott: computer engineer can make you a motherboard.

548
00:42:07,273 --> 00:42:07,896
Scott: That's what they do.

549
00:42:08,197 --> 00:42:09,705
Rym: yep in the symphony orchestra.

550
00:42:09,806 --> 00:42:14,583
Rym: the computer engineers Make the trumpets and the clarinets and all the instruments and give them to the IT guys.

551
00:42:14,844 --> 00:42:16,530
Scott: yeah, it's not easy.

552
00:42:17,052 --> 00:42:18,178
Rym: No, it's not good.

553
00:42:18,259 --> 00:42:20,450
Rym: God people fail out of that major like a rat.

554
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:22,055
Rym: It is a burning sinking ship.

555
00:42:22,155 --> 00:42:30,588
Scott: it is incredibly hard because you need to know about writing low-level assembly type firmwares you need to know about electronics and things like that.

556
00:42:30,608 --> 00:42:36,130
Scott: and It's pretty complex because you're sort of bridging the hardware and the software worlds.

557
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:41,570
Scott: You're not a computer scientist who's all about software, but you're not an electronic engineer who's all about hard.

558
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:47,617
Rym: I was just about to say that computer engineering is the major between Computer science and electrical engineer.

559
00:42:47,677 --> 00:42:53,438
Scott: you bridge the gap between hardware and software and that is a difficult task Which will get you a lot of monies.

560
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,147
Rym: yes, if you can it is fun.

561
00:42:55,267 --> 00:42:57,750
Scott: It is fun Though it is not as painful as database work.

562
00:42:57,931 --> 00:43:07,770
Rym: It is just requiring much more knowledge and also You'd be surprised the amount of physical dealing with electronic bits at some points that it also entails.

563
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:23,635
Scott: Yeah, like if you're a computer engineer you won't work for say Nvidia making Nvidia chips But you'll work for one of those video card companies like gigabyte or MSI You know buying Nvidia chips making video cards or sound cards or Any other crap like that.

564
00:43:24,197 --> 00:43:33,924
Rym: now another closely related major that most schools don't have because it's very specialized And you need a lot of capital to even set up the basic requirements of teaching.

565
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:35,730
Rym: This is micro electronic engineering.

566
00:43:36,152 --> 00:43:39,730
Scott: Micro electronic engineering is not the same as electronic engineering.

567
00:43:40,251 --> 00:43:43,039
Scott: Micro-electronic engineering is very easy to explain.

568
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:49,840
Rym: It's the guys at IBM or Nvidia or Intel AMD in the white bunnies AMD slash ATI.

569
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:57,007
Rym: Yes, those guys in the bunny suits that you see in those Intel commercials, you know the white spacesuits in the white rooms with the white and the yellow.

570
00:43:57,027 --> 00:43:59,055
Rym: Yes They're looking at giant machines.

571
00:43:59,175 --> 00:44:03,230
Scott: micro electronic engineers design and make computer chips.

572
00:44:03,551 --> 00:44:04,517
Scott: That is what they do.

573
00:44:04,537 --> 00:44:06,105
Scott: It is fucking hard.

574
00:44:06,186 --> 00:44:06,789
Scott: Holy shit.

575
00:44:07,151 --> 00:44:11,210
Rym: However, I mean, I know people who did a lot of that because I've worked at IBM.

576
00:44:11,351 --> 00:44:15,950
Scott: Well, if you end up being like, you know, the lead designing guy it is hard and pays.

577
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:25,309
Scott: Well, the thing is a lot of people who go into micro e. they end up with a job like just moving platters from one Machine to another a few times a day and it's a sweet gig.

578
00:44:25,952 --> 00:44:29,630
Rym: Well part of it's that there aren't many schools that offer that sort of program.

579
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:30,353
Scott: No, they're not.

580
00:44:31,076 --> 00:44:34,570
Rym: you need very advanced equipment let alone schools that have a good program.

581
00:44:34,811 --> 00:44:42,063
Rym: I mean RIT actually had the clean rooms with the people in white suits and they made RAM and all sorts of things as part Of their day, you know normal classwork.

582
00:44:42,365 --> 00:44:42,547
Rym: Mm-hmm.

583
00:44:43,696 --> 00:44:53,535
Rym: It's probably really fun major be warned that there's a lot more engineering and a lot more practical concerns and a lot less theory and a lot less Computers.

584
00:44:53,636 --> 00:44:53,898
Scott: there's.

585
00:44:53,918 --> 00:44:55,250
Scott: there's almost no computers.

586
00:44:55,370 --> 00:45:05,897
Scott: it's all you know low-level electronics and transistors and designing where the transistors go on this little piece of silicon and then the process of producing that piece of silicon.

587
00:45:05,957 --> 00:45:10,430
Scott: and there's some material science going on in there and It's it's science.

588
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:12,537
Scott: It is engineering and science and it is.

589
00:45:12,858 --> 00:45:14,021
Scott: it is not really computers.

590
00:45:14,182 --> 00:45:22,688
Rym: even though you are making things that go in computers You're also generally very restricted in the places you will work because very few places in the world requires such people.

591
00:45:22,708 --> 00:45:23,129
Rym: Mm-hmm.

592
00:45:23,711 --> 00:45:32,063
Rym: So you'll pretty much have to live near a major city or a major Microelectronic manufacturing center unless you rise up the chain enough to be some sort of designer.

593
00:45:32,363 --> 00:45:35,050
Rym: Mm-hmm, which actually they're outsourcing a lot of that overseas.

594
00:45:35,656 --> 00:45:42,590
Scott: If you go into this major You're going to be spending a lot of time working in college because it takes it just takes time to do this stuff.

595
00:45:42,891 --> 00:45:51,170
Scott: you're going to be having to learn a whole lot of very difficult things and Your jobs are gonna be pretty narrow.

596
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:54,470
Scott: So you're gonna have a lot of competition to get the best jobs and you get out.

597
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:56,698
Scott: Oh, there are not many people to compete with.

598
00:45:56,899 --> 00:45:59,810
Rym: however, you'll probably make good money and it did look like a lot of fun.

599
00:46:00,031 --> 00:46:03,145
Rym: I will warn you that those suits are not comfortable.

600
00:46:03,507 --> 00:46:07,410
Rym: No good God, do you not want to be in one of those suits though?

601
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:13,270
Rym: I imagine the higher up people who are doing the real work or the design work of the highly paid people get better suits.

602
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:15,818
Rym: But I didn't get a very nice suit at IBM at all.

603
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:17,142
Scott: Yeah, I do.

604
00:46:17,323 --> 00:46:19,590
Scott: I have heard stories of microelectronic engineers.

605
00:46:19,711 --> 00:46:24,250
Scott: They end up working somewhere and all they have to do is some moves and wafers from one machine to another.

606
00:46:24,671 --> 00:46:29,790
Scott: You know because that's how it ended up and they work like a few hours a day here and there.

607
00:46:30,151 --> 00:46:39,240
Scott: They get paid giant piles of money and they spend the rest of the day smoking weed and hanging out, but that's just hearsay I've heard now it could be true, but it might not be.

608
00:46:39,622 --> 00:46:48,250
Rym: there are a whole bunch of other related majors And there are also majors that are unique to a school or are brand new and haven't expanded past the school yet.

609
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:49,881
Rym: I guess we can touch on a bunch of them briefly.

610
00:46:49,921 --> 00:46:54,761
Rym: like RIT recently Split off applied networking from IT.

611
00:46:55,443 --> 00:46:57,590
Rym: So in fact, I met all the requirements for it.

612
00:46:57,610 --> 00:47:03,362
Rym: So I could have graduated with an IT degree, which is very broad-based or a networking degree Which is much more narrow and focused.

613
00:47:03,382 --> 00:47:11,350
Rym: and I chose IT Because no one's heard of applied networking and it's brand new and I'd rather have all the clout of having a broad IT Bachelor of Science.

614
00:47:12,291 --> 00:47:13,536
Rym: Also, that's what it says.

615
00:47:13,596 --> 00:47:14,198
Rym: It's networking.

616
00:47:14,359 --> 00:47:14,600
Scott: Yep.

617
00:47:15,022 --> 00:47:17,090
Scott: Also RIT had two different majors.

618
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:22,770
Scott: Both of them were called new media, but one of them was in the art school and one of them was in the IT school.

619
00:47:23,272 --> 00:47:26,686
Rym: Yes, the IT new media is the only one we would care about or talk about.

620
00:47:26,806 --> 00:47:29,516
Scott: and well No, the art new media is pretty simple.

621
00:47:29,817 --> 00:47:32,966
Scott: You want to be a guy who makes like, you know, good-looking websites.

622
00:47:33,327 --> 00:47:34,170
Scott: that that's what?

623
00:47:34,350 --> 00:47:34,771
Scott: That's what it is.

624
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:37,099
Scott: You're making flashes and good-looking websites.

625
00:47:37,239 --> 00:47:52,667
Rym: Yeah, but the new media and IT was basically Interactive digital design and you know designing websites designing, you know front ends for websites interfaces for things Anything that would involve new web 2.0 web whatever point.

626
00:47:52,767 --> 00:48:02,329
Rym: Oh media The major was kind of new and wasn't terribly well-defined when we were there and I imagine is still changing Yeah, and I don't know what kind of job you would get with that.

627
00:48:02,450 --> 00:48:16,717
Scott: But it seemed like the IT one concentrated more on you know, since it was a BS It was like the science of designing, you know, good interfaces and you know various things involving new types of media Whereas the art one was more about.

628
00:48:17,078 --> 00:48:24,850
Scott: but designing things from well from an art perspective, you know Making good-looking websites as opposed to the most user-friendly websites mathematically speaking.

629
00:48:25,951 --> 00:48:33,822
Rym: Now the only other real distinction is between a Bachelor of the Arts a Bachelor of Science and an associate's degree And I guess master's and doctorates.

630
00:48:34,165 --> 00:48:38,720
Scott: Yeah In terms of bachelors, we're talking about electronic engineering.

631
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,103
Rym: I don't think we really need to.

632
00:48:40,564 --> 00:48:52,182
Scott: electronic engineering is capacitors and Oscillators, yeah, you're making stuff like radios and cellphones and All kinds of electronics like you'll make we got.

633
00:48:52,202 --> 00:48:53,548
Rym: we're using a compressor for the show.

634
00:48:53,568 --> 00:48:55,397
Rym: right now You would be designing that.

635
00:48:55,739 --> 00:49:01,084
Rym: yeah, if you if you knew about audio electronics Yes, which is I mean, they're actually schematics on top of all these things.

636
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:01,947
Rym: I'm looking at one right now.

637
00:49:02,229 --> 00:49:11,935
Rym: Yeah But I hate to say this but in general if you get an associate's degree in any sort of technology field It's not terribly useful.

638
00:49:11,976 --> 00:49:14,344
Rym: you're probably better off just getting some certifications.

639
00:49:14,465 --> 00:49:19,701
Scott: Well, unless you're not aiming high I mean an associate's degree can get you a low-level job.

640
00:49:19,742 --> 00:49:22,430
Scott: You want to be you know, the the computer guy?

641
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:23,587
Scott: It's some small business.

642
00:49:23,931 --> 00:49:27,724
Scott: Associate's degree might do it for you want to be a tech support guy.

643
00:49:27,744 --> 00:49:29,450
Scott: so see this degree might do it for you.

644
00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:32,923
Rym: Well, the thing is you could learn most of that on your own without paying for an associate's.

645
00:49:32,943 --> 00:49:34,895
Scott: you could and you you very well could.

646
00:49:34,916 --> 00:49:41,109
Rym: yes and There used to be the perception that you get an associate's degree you get in the door and then you get promoted.

647
00:49:41,209 --> 00:49:51,716
Rym: and it used To be true, but it seems like now if you get an associate's degree You'll be pulling the cables for me as opposed and you'll never be me Watching someone else pull the cables

648
00:49:52,057 --> 00:49:53,061
Scott: because you won't know enough

649
00:49:53,622 --> 00:49:57,582
Rym: and even if you do you don't have a Bachelor of Science So most companies just won't even look at you.

650
00:49:57,602 --> 00:49:58,247
Rym: It's the sad truth.

651
00:49:58,609 --> 00:50:02,082
Scott: and Certifications, you know, I don't want to talk too much about them.

652
00:50:02,102 --> 00:50:04,270
Scott: We'll do a show about those generally against them.

653
00:50:04,412 --> 00:50:05,367
Scott: I think they're kind of stupid.

654
00:50:05,407 --> 00:50:08,804
Scott: but Certifications are mostly for older people.

655
00:50:08,824 --> 00:50:10,050
Scott: They're sort of going out of style.

656
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:12,902
Scott: It's like if you're a 50 year old dude, and you didn't.

657
00:50:13,042 --> 00:50:17,970
Scott: there wasn't a BS and you know Awesome IT when you were going to college, right?

658
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:23,852
Scott: Yeah, but you got a computer job back in those days because you knew about computers a long time ago when you know You didn't.

659
00:50:24,133 --> 00:50:28,390
Scott: there weren't computer degrees, but you knew about them and you got a job and you're still in the industry.

660
00:50:29,290 --> 00:50:32,465
Scott: Certifications are a way to stay current, you know, someone looks at your resume.

661
00:50:32,486 --> 00:50:33,390
Scott: You're a 40 year old, dude.

662
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:40,190
Scott: They say alright you worked doing COBOL 30 years ago, and you've been maintaining mainframes and whatever.

663
00:50:40,812 --> 00:50:44,970
Scott: Prove to me that you know, you still know what all this modern stuff we're using.

664
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:46,999
Scott: Yeah, you've gotten some certifications.

665
00:50:47,099 --> 00:50:55,546
Rym: the search prove one that you know something they prove it At least as far as the cert can prove that yeah And two they give you direction as to what you should be learning to stay in the game.

666
00:50:55,847 --> 00:50:56,008
Rym: Mm-hmm.

667
00:50:56,731 --> 00:51:03,238
Rym: But basically certs are useful if you don't have a degree or if your company will pay for them If your company will pay for them.

668
00:51:03,258 --> 00:51:10,250
Scott: they're great because if you want to see Anyone who would care about certifications is someone that I would not want to work for personally.

669
00:51:10,611 --> 00:51:18,945
Scott: However, if you were the type of person who wouldn't mind working for an idiot or at a sort of not the greatest company As long as they paid you.

670
00:51:19,531 --> 00:51:36,449
Scott: Certifications are great because if the person hiring you doesn't know much about technology You can just put a list of certifications like yeah I'm a Cisco certified blabbity blah and a Microsoft system certified blabbity blah and a plus whatnot and is something else and That'll totally impress them and you can get them to hire you.

671
00:51:36,931 --> 00:51:38,536
Scott: But anyone who that would impress?

672
00:51:38,656 --> 00:51:40,181
Scott: I would not want to work for now.

673
00:51:40,622 --> 00:51:49,226
Rym: if you have a bachelors of science or higher Certifications are effectively worthless because the Bachelor of Science speaks already enough.

674
00:51:49,627 --> 00:51:52,698
Scott: They'll see the BS They'll see I got a job and I don't have any certs.

675
00:51:53,381 --> 00:52:03,059
Rym: Yeah, I mean really if you have a bachelors of science That's nothing to sneeze at if it's from a good tech school and you don't need a single certification You barely even need job experience at this point.

676
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:06,330
Scott: I mean maybe 30 years down the road or something like that.

677
00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:09,530
Scott: There'll be all sorts of new fancy technologies that I'll know nothing about.

678
00:52:10,093 --> 00:52:21,608
Scott: You know, maybe I'll probably will know about them But I might be trying to get a job and people won't believe that I know about them because I've been working on this old-ass PHP Linux stuff from 30 years ago.

679
00:52:22,432 --> 00:52:26,583
Scott: So I'll go get some certification to prove that I still know my shit.

680
00:52:27,104 --> 00:52:27,225
Rym: now.

681
00:52:27,345 --> 00:52:32,490
Rym: as for masters and doctorates one There are barely if at all doctorates in IT.

682
00:52:33,373 --> 00:52:35,600
Scott: Yeah, there are doctors of computer science.

683
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:38,790
Rym: However, yes, but those will generally land you academic jobs.

684
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:52,934
Scott: Yeah, generally you could get them doing some really advanced stuff like, you know Designing things at really high-tech places like probably AMD or someone could use you if you're a doctor in computer science or Google.

685
00:52:53,277 --> 00:52:54,990
Scott: Google could definitely use you Google.

686
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:59,182
Scott: Well, basically if you want to work at Google You should get a master's or a doctorate because they want.

687
00:52:59,424 --> 00:53:00,590
Scott: it's gonna be hard for them to hire you.

688
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:14,290
Rym: Otherwise, yeah, at least for IT though I mean most IT master's programs aren't really any more rigorous Really than the bachelor's program and you're not gonna come out of a master's in IT program knowing much more.

689
00:53:14,410 --> 00:53:16,659
Rym: Then you would have known coming out of a bachelor's program.

690
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:19,490
Rym: Yeah, because you get out of the program whatever you put into it.

691
00:53:20,552 --> 00:53:27,090
Rym: So and also having a master's in IT Unless you're going into academia or some special job somewhere.

692
00:53:27,934 --> 00:53:31,530
Rym: If anything, it might make you less employable because now you're overqualified.

693
00:53:31,986 --> 00:53:41,292
Rym: No one's gonna hire you to be a Racker and stacker for Cisco switches because they know you'll quit the moment you get a better job and they know you're gonna demand a higher salary Mm-hmm.

694
00:53:42,134 --> 00:53:48,050
Scott: Yeah, basically if you're a master's or doctorate in any of these majors can be very useful.

695
00:53:48,554 --> 00:53:50,207
Scott: It depending on what school you get it from.

696
00:53:50,267 --> 00:53:54,521
Rym: and yes And yes is more useful than IT debt definitely when it comes to a master's.

697
00:53:54,622 --> 00:54:03,930
Scott: but you want to look at the jobs that those Degrees are going to get you before you get the degree Yes, or more importantly to what the degree is going to cost you.

698
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:10,510
Rym: I mean we had a friend Alex who basically took an accelerated program and got his master's with very little additional expense.

699
00:54:11,432 --> 00:54:12,439
Scott: Mmm, it's a great deal.

700
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:19,169
Rym: Yeah, something like that is a great deal If you can get a master's with minimal expenditure, you might as well do it.

701
00:54:19,591 --> 00:54:24,390
Rym: But don't put yourself into a lot of extra debt getting a master's unless you have a job in mind.

702
00:54:24,412 --> 00:54:32,310
Scott: Yeah plus remember there are jobs out there that you can get with your Bachelor's where the company will then eventually pay for you to get your master's at night school or something like that.

703
00:54:32,490 --> 00:54:35,221
Rym: Yeah, or maybe you get sick of computers all together.

704
00:54:35,261 --> 00:54:37,690
Rym: Like actually I'm looking at I've got a BS in IT.

705
00:54:37,931 --> 00:54:43,859
Rym: I'm kind of thinking about quitting my job Going to law school and being an IT lawyer.

706
00:54:43,879 --> 00:54:44,762
Scott: Yeah, you could.

707
00:54:45,203 --> 00:54:52,789
Rym: I mean once you have a Bachelor of Science in anything It's not difficult to go back to school get a semi unrelated degree in something else.

708
00:54:53,592 --> 00:54:53,813
Scott: Mm-hmm.

709
00:54:54,616 --> 00:54:58,090
Scott: There are a lot of combo degrees that will really do lots of fun stuff.

710
00:54:58,090 --> 00:55:03,610
Rym: Yeah, now watch out for a school that tries to give you a Bachelor of the Arts in any technological field.

711
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:08,510
Scott: Yes, if someone try if some school tries to give you a BA in CS do not go there.

712
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:11,721
Scott: Yeah, but that means that their program was not certified.

713
00:55:11,802 --> 00:55:11,962
Rym: Yes.

714
00:55:12,002 --> 00:55:14,210
Rym: We're not saying that Bachelors of the Arts are useless.

715
00:55:14,291 --> 00:55:17,410
Rym: In fact, they're very much useful but not in technology.

716
00:55:17,751 --> 00:55:24,852
Rym: Technology degrees are all bachelors of science and they're tricking you and ripping you off if you go to a school that offers a BA In any of these.

717
00:55:24,973 --> 00:55:29,466
Scott: yeah a BA in graphic design is good because you will become a successful graphic designer.

718
00:55:29,787 --> 00:55:39,270
Scott: a BA in CS Means you went to a crap school and anyone who knows anything won't hire you Because they won't believe that you learned anything worthwhile from some uncertified crap CS program.

719
00:55:39,913 --> 00:55:43,430
Rym: So I hope that was at least a little bit illuminating as to the possible options.

720
00:55:44,153 --> 00:55:46,924
Rym: If anyone has more questions about this feel free to email us.

721
00:55:46,944 --> 00:55:48,490
Rym: send us an audio post in the forums.

722
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:51,150
Rym: Yeah, if we get enough questions, we'll do another show on this.

723
00:55:51,230 --> 00:55:52,700
Rym: Otherwise, we'll just answer you directly.

724
00:55:53,023 --> 00:56:14,570
Scott: and just one final note If you like decide what kind of school you want to go to Make sure you ask that school about the majors they offer because it's not exactly the same at every school and you could probably Get on the phone with you know Like the chairman of the CS department of some school if you're especially if you're a hot Perspective student and they will explain to you what the different majors entail.

725
00:56:14,912 --> 00:56:20,890
Rym: Yeah, and I mean a lot of schools just don't offer everything like back in high school I was offered a full ride to Arizona State and I kind of considered it.

726
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:21,943
Rym: I wanted to go play in the band.

727
00:56:21,963 --> 00:56:22,469
Rym: It would have been cool.

728
00:56:22,610 --> 00:56:26,490
Rym: But then I looked and they had a CS program, but they didn't have an IT program.

729
00:56:26,932 --> 00:56:29,022
Rym: Yeah, so I was like, sorry, I can't go there.

730
00:56:29,062 --> 00:56:30,047
Rym: You don't have what I want.

731
00:56:30,308 --> 00:56:35,865
Scott: Mm-hmm Make sure to ask the school that that'll always get you the most accurate information.

732
00:56:35,905 --> 00:56:37,610
Rym: Yep, and of course send us feedback.

733
00:56:37,752 --> 00:56:39,350
Rym: Let us know if you want to hear more about this.

734
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:51,541
Rym: I mean we could go into great detail about our experiences in CS and IT respectively and we could go into great detail about what are the good schools and what are the Not-so-recognized schools when it comes to these majors.

735
00:56:52,143 --> 00:56:54,190
Scott: Yeah, but you could find that all from like the Internet.

736
00:56:54,692 --> 00:57:02,364
Rym: But if you really want us to tell you instead of Google you can instead of typing Google and then you know The names of schools the names of degrees just type Google GeekNights.
