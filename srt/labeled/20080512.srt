Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:45,104
Rym: So all this week I actually don't have to go to work Which it was weird because I woke up and I had this dream and someone comes up to me and says You have to wake up in five minutes, and I woke up and I go.

7
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:55,029
Rym: ah and I grab my phone And I look at it and it says 435 which yeah, I would have to wake up in five minutes if I was going to work.

8
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,699
Rym: So I went back to bed and a few hours later.

9
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:01,670
Rym: I woke up and went to training down on Wall Street.

10
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,501
Rym: I'm doing this training for a BMC service desk.

11
00:01:04,542 --> 00:01:06,390
Rym: It's like this giant enterprise ticketing system.

12
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:09,510
Rym: I got a week of training to do which I got to admit.

13
00:01:10,211 --> 00:01:17,899
Rym: Going to train I mean everyone else who goes to training for tech stuff is always like I'm going to training But I was super excited.

14
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,729
Rym: I think partly because I missed college, and it was like going to class.

15
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:24,830
Scott: Yeah, what did they actually teach you stuff there?

16
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:25,672
Scott: Was it sort of hokey?

17
00:01:25,873 --> 00:01:30,810
Rym: actually it was super good like we got a textbook and there I learned about those training things.

18
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:35,153
Rym: Well, I think a lot of them are crap, but this one is surprisingly not Crap with.

19
00:01:35,214 --> 00:01:36,740
Scott: the other people there seemed like they cared.

20
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,286
Rym: yeah, because there's only ten people.

21
00:01:38,748 --> 00:01:45,750
Rym: okay The cool thing is I guess if you didn't care you'd stand out when every morning We get bagels and locks and cream cheese That's nice.

22
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:51,210
Rym: And then for lunch we get a really really nice lunch at this fancy like pub bar and grill down the street.

23
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,435
Scott: Well you go you paid for.

24
00:01:52,455 --> 00:01:53,781
Rym: I didn't pay crap.

25
00:01:53,982 --> 00:01:54,324
Rym: Well.

26
00:01:54,404 --> 00:01:55,730
Scott: I mean someone paid a lot for it.

27
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,219
Rym: Yeah, the class was like thirty five hundred bucks.

28
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:01,230
Scott: Yeah, yeah, but it costs as much as like eight weeks to summer care.

29
00:02:01,492 --> 00:02:03,730
Rym: Yeah, they flew the instructor out from Texas.

30
00:02:04,071 --> 00:02:08,888
Rym: So he's like yeah class ends a little early today at 430. cuz I'm going to see the letterman.

31
00:02:08,907 --> 00:02:09,550
Rym: I got some tickets.

32
00:02:09,872 --> 00:02:12,250
Scott: Yeah, it's a lot of people like to do that when they come to the city.

33
00:02:12,711 --> 00:02:26,325
Rym: I'm really not interested in seeing letterman at all, but as a result I had to take the 705 Express instead of my usual 532 Express And the train was crowded, but the 705 is like the most crowded train.

34
00:02:26,345 --> 00:02:27,330
Scott: cuz it goes straight there.

35
00:02:27,591 --> 00:02:29,458

Scott: I used to do it now.

44
00:02:38,077 --> 00:02:38,540

Rym: so yeah Well see if I usually if I go home I take the 410 or the 445 which is one of those semi locals.

00:08:09,257 --> 00:08:12,530
Scott: the fact that you can quit for any reason is that they can fire you at?

155
00:08:13,211 --> 00:08:15,198
Scott: You know how some people call that right to work.

156
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:16,844
Scott: That's not what right to work is.

157
00:08:17,286 --> 00:08:19,286
Scott: right to work is actually something We don't have.

158
00:08:20,052 --> 00:08:24,365
Scott: Right to work means if there's a union you can't be forced to join it.

159
00:08:24,706 --> 00:08:25,790
Scott: I wish we had right to work.

160
00:08:25,952 --> 00:08:34,476
Rym: We don't Because I was always told that right to work states include that clause and all the stuff about able to quit The the stuff about.

161
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:37,865
Scott: you know quit for any time any reason and fire for any time at any reason.

162
00:08:37,885 --> 00:08:39,308
Scott: our work at will?

163
00:08:39,328 --> 00:08:41,917
Rym: ah I must have conflated the two.

164
00:08:42,058 --> 00:08:46,137
Scott: right to work means you have a right to work there You don't have to join the freaking Union.

165
00:08:46,177 --> 00:08:48,406
Scott: you see that's why I was always confused.

166
00:08:48,446 --> 00:08:49,550
Scott: because right to work.

167
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,770
Scott: I was like how does me how does I can quit any time?

168
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:54,962
Scott: I want to mean right have a right to work.

169
00:08:55,022 --> 00:08:59,361
Scott: that didn't really match up Yeah, and that guy was like oh, that's work at will.

170
00:08:59,722 --> 00:09:06,367
Scott: and right to work is don't have to pay union dues You can work there anyway, even though you'll probably be strong-armed if everyone else is in the Union.

171
00:09:06,407 --> 00:09:12,229
Scott: well now You know and we don't have right to work in New York State Which is why if there's a union you have to join it.

172
00:09:12,431 --> 00:09:15,749
Rym: But at the same time at least we have the other one because the other one is much.

173
00:09:16,071 --> 00:09:22,541
Scott: I would rather if I had to only pick one I would take part of that because we work in an industry where there are No unions, and there's no reason for unions.

174
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,502
Scott: Yeah, that's correct all right There's a lot of places.

175
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:28,970
Rym: There's no reason Yeah, but there are places where I mean coal miners.

176
00:09:29,232 --> 00:09:30,298
Rym: I think they deserve a union.

177
00:09:30,338 --> 00:09:32,430
Scott: coal miners do need a union yes anyway.

178
00:09:32,912 --> 00:09:34,418
Scott: So the point is it works.

179
00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:37,130
Scott: get a little weird like my number one cuz like in the tech department right?

180
00:09:37,331 --> 00:09:40,030
Scott: There's the boss right cuz the company is run by four partners.

181
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,783
Scott: So I guess I assume they each own 25% of the company.

182
00:09:43,104 --> 00:09:44,410
Scott: they all started it together, right?

183
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:44,955
Scott: I'm just a suit.

184
00:09:44,995 --> 00:09:45,681
Scott: that makes sense.

185
00:09:46,448 --> 00:09:47,955
Scott: and So there's the partner.

186
00:09:47,975 --> 00:09:49,781
Scott: who's the tech partner right?

187
00:09:50,002 --> 00:09:52,090
Scott: There's the IT guy who does this is admitting.

188
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,197
Scott: There's the guy who is the developer.

189
00:09:54,258 --> 00:10:06,590
Scott: you're like when I got there plus the the partner the tech partners also Developer and as me I'm like the newer developer right the guy who is pretty much I'm a number one co-worker the the guy who was the developer when I got there.

190
00:10:07,031 --> 00:10:13,216
Scott: He was gonna quit mostly because like you know his family situation like living in New York wasn't so good for him anymore And he needs.

191
00:10:13,257 --> 00:10:18,022
Scott: he wants his kid to go to school somewhere good And he couldn't really afford to live anywhere close enough.

192
00:10:18,143 --> 00:10:19,449
Scott: You know and it wasn't working out.

193
00:10:19,489 --> 00:10:21,680
Scott: so He wanted to move to Boston.

194
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:26,804
Scott: He's got some family up there You know and such, but so they were like oh, no, we can't let you go.

195
00:10:26,824 --> 00:10:28,169
Scott: We'll be screwed right.

196
00:10:29,092 --> 00:10:31,829
Rym: But I believe we just determined that in this state.

197
00:10:33,351 --> 00:10:41,146
Scott: Right right, but they basically you know they couldn't have stopped them from going But they convinced him to keep saying, but they didn't convince him to physically stay.

198
00:10:41,187 --> 00:10:43,885
Scott: they basically said all right We'll let you go and you'll telecommute whatever.

199
00:10:44,187 --> 00:10:50,801
Rym: that's fine Cuz I remember the hospital tried to convince me to stay and I was like unless you give me a hundred percent raise I'm walking out the door today.

200
00:10:50,822 --> 00:10:54,867
Scott: Yeah, so Yeah, you should have said no hundred percent raise in telecommuting.

201
00:10:57,012 --> 00:11:00,570
Scott: You know the hundred percent raise would have been a hospital job really wasn't a telecommute job.

202
00:11:00,731 --> 00:11:02,300
Scott: No, I wanted to go to places now.

203
00:11:02,341 --> 00:11:03,810
Rym: I have a not my current job.

204
00:11:03,891 --> 00:11:04,113
Rym: I could.

205
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:05,061
Rym: I could do 90% of the job.

206
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,877
Scott: I could telecommute my job.

207
00:11:07,957 --> 00:11:10,949
Scott: my boss sort of has this hang up about like they want people to be there.

208
00:11:11,851 --> 00:11:12,736
Scott: He's like it's not good.

209
00:11:12,776 --> 00:11:15,150
Scott: It's like it's not as the same as face-to-face.

210
00:11:15,694 --> 00:11:17,586
Rym: You know what though I think it's better.

211
00:11:17,606 --> 00:11:18,230
Rym: in a lot of ways.

212
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:20,700
Rym: I feel like you should have a mix.

213
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,607
Rym: I mean my ideal work situation.

214
00:11:22,627 --> 00:11:28,344
Rym: cuz even if I could Sometimes what I'm saying is even if I could telecommute right at my current job.

215
00:11:28,746 --> 00:11:30,030
Rym: I kind of like going into the city.

216
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:31,718
Rym: I actually enjoy my train rides.

217
00:11:31,778 --> 00:11:32,844
Rym: I like being down there.

218
00:11:32,904 --> 00:11:34,130
Rym: I like working with my co-workers.

219
00:11:34,351 --> 00:11:48,070
Rym: I feel like if I could telecommute as much as I wanted I would probably Telecommute like two days a week at most except maybe in the summer You know, I think I would go to work at most one day every one or two weeks.

220
00:11:48,534 --> 00:11:50,170
Rym: Oh, well, I guess our works different.

221
00:11:50,271 --> 00:11:51,102
Rym: I I do a lot of.

222
00:11:51,122 --> 00:11:55,688
Rym: I Guess my charisma counts for a lot in the kind of work I do and the kinds of things I deal with.

223
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:57,169
Rym: so it's kind Of useful to be there in person.

224
00:11:57,698 --> 00:12:07,605
Scott: I mostly just Sit at the desk and the only time I really need to be there is if someone sends me an email that tells me to Do something but they're not very clear and I actually need to discuss it with them.

225
00:12:07,785 --> 00:12:12,079
Rym: Well, you just do a WebEx Right anyway, all right, we got all that set up.

226
00:12:12,119 --> 00:12:14,568
Rym: now I can video conference with anyone in any of the offices.

227
00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:15,652
Rym: actually It's cool.

228
00:12:15,954 --> 00:12:18,950
Rym: We have like this bought like all these sales offices around the country around the world.

229
00:12:19,612 --> 00:12:21,138
Rym: So the sales area right.

230
00:12:21,178 --> 00:12:29,630
Rym: we have this camera that points at all those people and I can like Microphones in the ceiling and there's a constant teleconference between all of our offices each other's screens.

231
00:12:29,691 --> 00:12:30,148
Scott: That'd be cool.

232
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:38,050
Rym: You can set that up but we just see each other on that screen and you can like if you'll see because people kind of all stand around the Camera and just talk all the time with all the other offices.

233
00:12:38,211 --> 00:12:42,830
Scott: But we can also share desktops and video and yeah sharing the desktops is key for the tech people.

234
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,760
Scott: But anyway, yes good God it is.

235
00:12:44,961 --> 00:12:46,127
Rym: So I click on this.

236
00:12:46,328 --> 00:12:46,709
Rym: click on it.

237
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:47,294
Scott: Just get.

238
00:12:47,495 --> 00:12:48,463
Scott: let me give me it.

239
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:57,695
Scott: in addition to that They were gonna hire this program manager guy Right to sort of come in and sort of manage all the stuff which would have been cool because then I wouldn't have had to Like talk to people.

240
00:12:57,736 --> 00:13:13,390
Scott: he would have like talked to all the people I would I'm talking to now So I wouldn't had to use a telephone or anything I could just you know, he would have sorted all that business out for me and taking some of the work I don't want to do off my hands and such right and also taking care of our databases so I can concentrate more on the apps.

241
00:13:14,092 --> 00:13:20,452
Scott: But the guy he's agreed to work for us and then two days before he was he was gonna start working today and like Thursday Last week.

242
00:13:20,472 --> 00:13:21,316
Scott: He's like, yeah, fuck you.

243
00:13:21,818 --> 00:13:22,701
Scott: So what an ass.

244
00:13:22,781 --> 00:13:23,866
Scott: that was pretty unprofessional.

245
00:13:24,227 --> 00:13:24,809
Scott: I wouldn't do that.

246
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:25,331
Rym: Well,

247
00:13:25,792 --> 00:13:39,414
Scott: at the very least if I agree to work some that somewhere I would show up and I might quit really quickly like the second Day, but I wouldn't say, you know I wouldn't say yes And then say no if I was gonna say no if I there's any chance of me saying no I wouldn't say yes yet.

248
00:13:39,454 --> 00:13:40,538
Scott: I'd say maybe hold on.

249
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:41,502
Rym: Yeah.

250
00:13:41,743 --> 00:13:43,430
Rym: I mean I can foresee a situation.

251
00:13:43,571 --> 00:13:45,724
Rym: Let's say you accepted a job you were excited about.

252
00:13:45,744 --> 00:13:46,247
Rym: they're paying you.

253
00:13:46,308 --> 00:13:47,453
Rym: I don't know $80,000 a year.

254
00:13:47,474 --> 00:13:54,326
Rym: All right, and then two days later you're supposed to start in a week You get offered a job that pays twice.

255
00:13:54,386 --> 00:13:54,627
Rym: that.

256
00:13:54,688 --> 00:13:55,150
Scott: that's the thing.

257
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,053
Scott: Is that an offer?

258
00:13:56,073 --> 00:14:00,450
Scott: if an offer really came out of nowhere like that, right?

259
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:04,809
Scott: Like I didn't I didn't have like an appending thing on the table, you know.

260
00:14:05,991 --> 00:14:12,257
Scott: Then I would you know if it just came out of nowhere like someone just called me up randomly and said I'll give you like A jillion dollars, right?

261
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,830
Scott: I'd say well, I just accepted this other job.

262
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:18,286
Scott: It'd be really rude if I like just you know told them no.

263
00:14:18,326 --> 00:14:18,909
Scott: after I told them.

264
00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:27,783
Scott: Yes I'll work there a couple days and see how it is and You know, just hold on to that money and I'll call you back next week.

265
00:14:27,823 --> 00:14:34,089
Scott: I promise to tell you yes or no, you know I did something like that because it's it's a lot more asshole to be like no.

266
00:14:34,169 --> 00:14:38,830
Scott: Yes No, you know because if you say yes, they've already stopped looking and it's sort of like yeah

267
00:14:39,091 --> 00:14:49,190
Rym: yeah, but at the same time and it's kind of a the IT world in the CS world is kind of weird because Sometimes like there are obvious times when you don't want to burn your bridges.

268
00:14:49,311 --> 00:14:50,519
Rym: I mean, I like the people at IBM.

269
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:57,630
Rym: I still talk to him on occasion, but Sometimes you just burn all your bridges because you know, you're never gonna work in that sector again, and you really don't care.

270
00:14:57,892 --> 00:15:05,064
Scott: Yeah, but anyway, it's sort of like, you know We're in a situation where my work obviously needs me a lot because they're having trouble like hiring.

271
00:15:05,084 --> 00:15:08,293
Scott: the people well demand a raise Vacation days.

272
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:13,229
Scott: Yeah, and now they're telling me like yeah, we'd like you to stay later, which is like doom.

273
00:15:13,732 --> 00:15:24,722
Scott: I almost missed the train coming home today, you know Cuz I had the time that they wanted me to leave does not work Well with the train schedule and I got home like an hour later Which pretty much just means I can have an hour less of sleep.

274
00:15:24,803 --> 00:15:26,753
Scott: and you know, I'm gonna take away I might.

275
00:15:26,773 --> 00:15:29,250
Scott: I think I might take work off tomorrow just to get my shit sorted out.

276
00:15:29,531 --> 00:15:34,830
Scott: I got shit to sort out laundry and stuff and and video yeah and stuff like that.

277
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,476
Rym: So it's actually our new boundary.

278
00:15:36,516 --> 00:15:38,002
Rym: microphone will be here in a couple days.

279
00:15:38,182 --> 00:15:38,544
Scott: Oh, man.

280
00:15:38,624 --> 00:15:40,270
Rym: Yeah, they're doing video a lot easier.

281
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:47,102
Scott: I think I'm gonna take a day off this week, you know calling sick maybe tomorrow I don't know but regardless works getting a little weird, but it's like.

282
00:15:47,162 --> 00:15:49,730
Scott: I don't want to screw them because I like these people.

283
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:50,797
Scott: That's why you got a late.

284
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:55,059
Scott: That's when you lay down working there Despite the work itself being kind of lame is cuz?

285
00:15:55,099 --> 00:15:57,308
Scott: I like the people's but it's like with the hospital.

286
00:15:57,408 --> 00:15:57,488
Rym: one.

287
00:15:57,569 --> 00:15:59,076
Rym: one time There was a couple times.

288
00:15:59,096 --> 00:16:00,423
Scott: You don't like the people at the hospital.

289
00:16:00,664 --> 00:16:01,790
Rym: I like a couple of the people.

290
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:06,781
Rym: You know what though all the people I liked at the hospital Quit while I was working there.

291
00:16:06,801 --> 00:16:11,580
Rym: Yeah, it's like a lot of the people Was like get the hell out get out as soon as you can.

292
00:16:11,781 --> 00:16:12,764
Rym: I'll give you references.

293
00:16:13,386 --> 00:16:14,430
Rym: You want to work where I'm going?

294
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:15,953
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

295
00:16:16,013 --> 00:16:16,334
Scott: I'm gonna do.

296
00:16:16,354 --> 00:16:19,185
Scott: the thing is I was looking at Craigslist and there's mad jobs.

297
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:20,430
Scott: There's so many jobs now.

298
00:16:20,531 --> 00:16:22,544
Scott: I'm like no wonder having a hard time finding people.

299
00:16:22,605 --> 00:16:24,014
Scott: It's all these freaking job I would do.

300
00:16:24,054 --> 00:16:31,565
Rym: then go to you like tell your boss honestly like look I'm not gonna be a jerk and demand like some crazy high salary or demand like four months vacation.

301
00:16:31,646 --> 00:16:32,869
Rym: cuz I know you need me.

302
00:16:35,093 --> 00:16:42,720
Rym: What I would say is but saying late is not going to make me accomplish anymore, yeah Well, it's mostly not an issue of me accomplishing more.

303
00:16:43,162 --> 00:16:48,870
Scott: It's mostly an issue of for example You know the other people at the office work.

304
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:55,571
Scott: You know set hours right and they might need something done at like five, but I leave it for 30.

305
00:16:55,571 --> 00:16:57,877
Scott: So it's because they work until like six.

306
00:16:58,339 --> 00:16:59,643
Scott: they might need something done.

307
00:16:59,663 --> 00:17:00,044
Scott: I don't.

308
00:17:00,164 --> 00:17:02,150
Rym: after I leave it seems like a lot of people.

309
00:17:02,311 --> 00:17:03,376
Scott: I know I'm not there.

310
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:04,099
Scott: It's not gonna get done.

311
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,145
Rym: It seems like a lot of people.

312
00:17:05,205 --> 00:17:06,030
Rym: I know work in the city.

313
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:09,061
Rym: They always show up to work real late, and then they leave.

314
00:17:09,183 --> 00:17:11,050
Scott: really yeah, I don't understand these people.

315
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:15,810
Scott: They show up right like yeah like 11, and then they leave it like six or seven.

316
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:16,916
Scott: I'm like what the fuck is wrong.

317
00:17:16,977 --> 00:17:17,560
Rym: I want to get home.

318
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:17,702
Rym: Well.

319
00:17:17,722 --> 00:17:18,990
Rym: It's still light out and do stuff.

320
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:20,499
Scott: Yeah, it's like I want to do things.

321
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:22,390
Scott: It's like what do you and where do you eat dinner?

322
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:25,150
Rym: You know well if you're in Manhattan you just eat dinner.

323
00:17:25,431 --> 00:17:26,838
Scott: I don't think these people aren't in Manhattan.

324
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,290
Scott: one of the guys there is even crazy so crazy.

325
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:35,530
Scott: He fucking takes the bus right over to fucking Jersey like to Bergen County.

326
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:40,075
Scott: I'm like holy shit that I worked at the hospital Like eight or nine.

327
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:45,270
Rym: there was a guy who lived in Connecticut far away who worked in Yonkers every day.

328
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:47,921
Rym: He drove an hour and 45 minutes.

329
00:17:48,303 --> 00:17:49,488
Scott: Oh, that's just crazy.

330
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:50,010
Rym: I look at that.

331
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:50,873
Rym: It's like wow.

332
00:17:51,294 --> 00:17:54,606
Rym: I mean I have an hour train ride, but none of that time is lost.

333
00:17:54,646 --> 00:18:00,909
Rym: I mean I realized today I watched two episodes of princess tutu on the way to work, and then I played some sieve.

334
00:18:00,949 --> 00:18:05,765
Rym: for I played sieve for while listening to Dave and Joel.

335
00:18:06,026 --> 00:18:09,742
Scott: yeah on the way to work I listen to podcast and on the way home.

336
00:18:09,762 --> 00:18:11,250
Scott: I was sort of sleepy.

337
00:18:12,215 --> 00:18:15,898
Scott: Yeah Anyway, let's let's move to some news here.

338
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:22,028
Rym: alright, so it's kind of a running gag at my work But we often make fun of the French.

339
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:28,190
Rym: The other like production support engineer at my level he's French.

340
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,864
Scott: He's a really cool guy pretty much has the same job as you.

341
00:18:31,548 --> 00:18:35,970
Rym: pretty much I mean, it's like we're the same level and we nominally like we do the same job.

342
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:40,803
Rym: We support the production servers the revenue generating servers cuz in big.

343
00:18:40,903 --> 00:18:45,922
Rym: actually we should do a Monday show some time about what enterprise Really means like what all those like business terms.

344
00:18:45,962 --> 00:18:46,987
Scott: I got a funny anecdote.

345
00:18:47,007 --> 00:18:48,735
Scott: you ready So what?

346
00:18:48,755 --> 00:18:53,809
Scott: so one of our listeners today sends me a message, and he's like he's like Do you know what data warehouses?

347
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:54,873
Scott: You know like.

348
00:18:54,893 --> 00:18:55,155
Scott: he's like.

349
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,650
Scott: can you tell me some of the advantages disadvantages of data warehouses?

350
00:18:57,831 --> 00:19:00,181
Scott: I'm like what do you mean by data warehouses?

351
00:19:00,201 --> 00:19:02,010
Scott: like a big building full of data?

352
00:19:02,351 --> 00:19:04,980
Rym: You know storage, you know what that word is.

353
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,710
Rym: hold on I can tell you what that bullet for that fucking word.

354
00:19:07,871 --> 00:19:08,476
Scott: So hold on.

355
00:19:08,536 --> 00:19:09,767
Scott: so then he's like no.

356
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:18,117
Scott: And so I went to the Wikipedia for data warehouse and data warehouse pretty much just meant use a database you moron That's pretty much what it means.

357
00:19:18,298 --> 00:19:24,930
Rym: Yeah, well usually what it what it really means is database plus saying plus like business.

358
00:19:25,971 --> 00:19:39,385
Scott: But according to the data according to the Wikipedia it pretty much just meant keep all your data in like one database or in some sort of you know Centralized cohesive intelligent ways that you could actually get the most out of your data.

359
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:40,328
Rym: Let me put it this way.

360
00:19:40,348 --> 00:19:43,765
Scott: so I Tell him I tell him right.

361
00:19:43,846 --> 00:19:46,924
Scott: he's like yeah I'm at this new job, and they asked me if you know you do a data.

362
00:19:46,964 --> 00:19:48,010
Scott: warehouses were right.

363
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:48,512
Scott: So I'm like.

364
00:19:48,533 --> 00:19:52,050
Scott: that's obviously just a buzzword that just means use a database.

365
00:19:52,151 --> 00:19:53,969
Scott: It's a kind of word you use to explain.

366
00:19:54,251 --> 00:20:00,850
Scott: It's like a businessman who doesn't understand technology that you know you should use a database and put all your data in a data warehouse.

367
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:04,994
Rym: most enterprise words are Basically just like.

368
00:20:05,115 --> 00:20:07,100
Rym: they carry more baggage like we're.

369
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:15,295
Rym: the word data warehouse in the enterprise world does carry a lot more baggage than Have a database I know, but it's you know I mean But it involves a lot of.

370
00:20:15,656 --> 00:20:22,910
Rym: but the thing is those words the biggest misconception do not describe Technological solutions, they don't describe technology.

371
00:20:23,311 --> 00:20:37,050
Rym: They describe business processes and like a front-end stuff and like how to put it together and like the methodology and the semantics and all That right and the back end that the core stuff the actual data warehouse is what the techies make and it's just a database.

372
00:20:37,211 --> 00:20:38,963
Scott: Yeah, so I tell him right.

373
00:20:39,023 --> 00:20:53,823
Scott: I tell him yeah You need those kind of words to you know to explain to business people you know because just you know these Common-sense things is even though just having a database you know a relational database You know and making all the data useful seems like common sense to us.

374
00:20:54,244 --> 00:20:57,595
Scott: if you say that to a normal person They'll have no clue what you're talking about.

375
00:20:57,957 --> 00:21:05,490
Scott: so you need to use a buzzword like data warehouse to convince them that You know they shouldn't be just emailing Excel spreadsheets all around the office.

376
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:06,956
Rym: I'll tell you one other thing.

377
00:21:07,638 --> 00:21:23,461
Rym: in the majority of the IT world or the tech world you can tell the people who deal with this stuff on a daily basis from those who don't because People who don't refer to it as our data warehouse or though it data warehouse But people who deal with it just say I'm working on data warehouse.

378
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:25,507
Rym: When are we gonna finish data warehouse?

379
00:21:25,587 --> 00:21:39,270
Scott: Yeah, so anyway He ends up IMing me back like a few minutes later right like a little while later, and he's like yeah Apparently they said they need data warehouse whatever because the people are emailing around spreadsheets like you said.

380
00:21:39,572 --> 00:21:41,668
Scott: And I'm like do I know or do I know?

381
00:21:43,471 --> 00:21:45,801
Rym: God we got to do a show we need to do a Monday.

382
00:21:45,922 --> 00:21:48,174
Rym: a very specific like ask What?

383
00:21:48,214 --> 00:21:49,690
Scott: not to use Excel spreadsheets?

384
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:50,995
Scott: We just do a whole show on.

385
00:21:51,015 --> 00:21:52,782
Rym: oh you want to know the answer to what.

386
00:21:52,842 --> 00:22:00,746
Rym: not to use Excel spreadsheets for anything But except accounting and even then you can only want a dedicated accounting system.

387
00:22:00,866 --> 00:22:02,390
Rym: probably good guy anyway.

388
00:22:02,611 --> 00:22:04,379
Rym: Anyway, that's a whole separate show.

389
00:22:04,962 --> 00:22:09,376
Rym: Oh, I didn't even do my new fucking news Friends and that's right.

390
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:09,858
Scott: It's awesome.

391
00:22:09,878 --> 00:22:13,430
Scott: It's your news is friends, so Google Street View which I think is fantastic.

392
00:22:13,676 --> 00:22:14,229
Scott: It's pretty cool.

393
00:22:14,475 --> 00:22:14,948
Scott: It's useful.

394
00:22:15,352 --> 00:22:17,344
Scott: You know when you want to see like what a place looks like.

395
00:22:17,364 --> 00:22:20,889
Scott: there's a lot of times You'll know the address and but you won't and you know the number.

396
00:22:21,211 --> 00:22:24,390
Scott: But like you look around you won't see the number and it's like some sort of hidden place.

397
00:22:24,912 --> 00:22:25,717
Scott: So the Google Street View.

398
00:22:25,737 --> 00:22:28,069
Scott: you can like a high sort of see a green sign there.

399
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:28,618
Scott: now I know it's a look.

400
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:29,872
Rym: for now else go It's useful.

401
00:22:30,273 --> 00:22:36,736
Rym: say you look up a business and you find the address and you look at the street view and realize that that business Hasn't been there for years.

402
00:22:36,937 --> 00:22:40,330
Scott: I could also you got to watch out if you don't know this hidden inside the building businesses.

403
00:22:40,764 --> 00:22:48,849
Rym: Yeah but I used it to check whether a ski shop was there or not and it wasn't on two occasions and That was after I'd try to go and find the ski shops and they weren't there.

404
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:55,461
Scott: So like the place I bought my Eddie Modix the hearing aid place is like Inside a building on like the fourth floor deep inside.

405
00:22:55,482 --> 00:22:57,470
Rym: Well, if you're talking about that you can't forget a picopita.

406
00:22:57,852 --> 00:22:58,416
Scott: I know right.

407
00:22:58,899 --> 00:23:00,650
Scott: All right, but and that picopita has a scaffolding.

408
00:23:00,691 --> 00:23:01,205
Scott: So it's even worse.

409
00:23:01,953 --> 00:23:14,848
Rym: Google Street View has run into a lot of problems in the United States partly because One a lot of people do not understand the law when it comes to privacy and photography And a lot of people a lot of people think they have a lot more rights than they do.

410
00:23:15,451 --> 00:23:17,097
Rym: But I'm not a lawyer.

411
00:23:17,117 --> 00:23:18,482
Rym: This is not a legal opinion.

412
00:23:18,502 --> 00:23:20,590
Rym: Do not take legal advice from GeekNights.

413
00:23:21,071 --> 00:23:34,669
Rym: However, as far as I'm aware pretty much in most cases you can take anything you can see with reasonable Accommodation from a public place you can take a picture of and no one's allowed to stop you.

414
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:35,031
Rym: now Right.

415
00:23:35,072 --> 00:23:38,151
Scott: It's like if you're standing on a public street, you can take pictures You can't.

416
00:23:38,171 --> 00:23:39,376
Scott: the only exceptions are like.

417
00:23:39,697 --> 00:23:40,420
Scott: you can't take like.

418
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,332
Scott: I think you can't take like a zoom lens to peep into someone's house Can't?

419
00:23:43,372 --> 00:23:50,270
Rym: if you take a telephoto lens shot of a naked person through their bedroom window It's if someone has a reasonable expectation of privacy.

420
00:23:50,651 --> 00:23:55,170
Rym: However, the definition of reasonable is much stricter than most people realize.

421
00:23:55,973 --> 00:24:05,770
Rym: But anyway, so as a result a lot of people get really bent out of shape about Google But luckily they can't do much about it and to Google does not have to accommodate these idiots.

422
00:24:06,091 --> 00:24:07,176
Rym: But often they do.

423
00:24:07,216 --> 00:24:10,310
Rym: and if you say hey Google, could you retake the picture of this spot?

424
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:13,970
Rym: They usually will like there's a naked guy in front of my business.

425
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:20,057
Rym: Could you please come back when there isn't a naked guy and Google usually like, okay, we'll come back or okay Hey, I'm in this picture.

426
00:24:20,097 --> 00:24:22,549
Scott: I don't want to be in that picture and they're cool about it.

427
00:24:22,891 --> 00:24:26,210
Rym: And that's you know, that's the kind of when it comes to civil liberties.

428
00:24:27,052 --> 00:24:34,147
Rym: I really like the idea that people have freedoms like you should have the freedom to take the pictures and do whatever you want with them and all that.

429
00:24:34,629 --> 00:24:44,430
Rym: but Just because you have a freedom doesn't mean you have to always exercise it and like Google has the discretion to Be nice or to exercise their freedom on a case-by-case basis.

430
00:24:44,491 --> 00:24:45,570
Scott: That's what it's free about it.

431
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:50,160
Scott: If you had to if you had to you know Keep the picture up and give the guy the finger all the time.

432
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,230
Scott: That's that's also not freedom.

433
00:24:53,092 --> 00:24:59,922
Scott: You know if you have to use every right you have and you can't you know Decide not to use your right then you're not really free.

434
00:24:59,942 --> 00:25:01,830
Scott: you get the free means you have to be able to choose.

435
00:25:02,392 --> 00:25:04,180
Rym: But anyway to quote slash out here.

436
00:25:04,221 --> 00:25:13,382
Rym: to sum this up because we've been talking a little bit Google has begun to scan the streets of Paris as part of the street view service But the company may be hindered from publishing them unedited.

437
00:25:13,442 --> 00:25:20,023
Rym: the reason French privacy laws Google may be forced to blur faces or use low-resolution versions of their photographs.

438
00:25:20,525 --> 00:25:21,066
Rym: the deal here.

439
00:25:21,107 --> 00:25:31,054
Rym: Basically is that France has very strict privacy laws, which you know, a lot of people are privacy advocates, but in this case I Patently disagree.

440
00:25:31,074 --> 00:25:40,210
Rym: I feel like anything that is visible from a public place is Public property in terms of viewing like if you're worried about your privacy, why are you walking around a public street?

441
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:45,790
Scott: It's like, you know, if you want something be private do it in your house with the blinds closed.

442
00:25:46,052 --> 00:25:46,998
Rym: but there's this very.

443
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:58,174
Rym: this is an interesting problem because a Very useful very cool amazing technology something that would have been unfathomable to me five years ago and is now like this Daily.

444
00:25:58,194 --> 00:25:58,616
Rym: the you like.

445
00:25:58,656 --> 00:26:01,069
Rym: I use this tool on a daily basis and it's awesome.

446
00:26:01,972 --> 00:26:15,570
Rym: the people of Paris might not be able to get this obviously beneficial technology because they have overbearing laws Restricting the rights of using photographs and images and things to protect their privacy.

447
00:26:15,731 --> 00:26:18,450
Scott: Well, that's been the battle of the past however many years isn't it?

448
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:24,070
Scott: Is that technology pushing against the the laws designed to work in a world where those technologies are not possible?

449
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:25,655
Rym: I just I don't know.

450
00:26:25,755 --> 00:26:36,369
Rym: I feel like we need to do a whole show on just the idea of privacy in the modern world Because on one hand I feel like there are certain rights to bastions of privacy But the other hand I feel like medical records.

451
00:26:36,752 --> 00:26:51,978
Rym: I feel like as the world gets more and more interconnected You can't hide a lot of information and it actually I think a lot of technologies are being hindered by the fact That people are so afraid or that like social security numbers You shouldn't have to hide your social security number.

452
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:58,670
Rym: the fact that people can use that number which is not secure in any way To do things is horrible.

453
00:26:59,345 --> 00:27:10,250
Rym: Yeah That's just like that because social security numbers were conceived in an era before The interlink databases that we have today and I feel like the system is broken to the point of it should just be completely scrapped.

454
00:27:10,612 --> 00:27:17,630
Scott: Yeah, something like that the number system not social security But security is a topic for another show I raised like four issues.

455
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:22,890
Rym: So this is basically my news is we're gonna do like five shows on stuff like this in the future?

456
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:26,487
Scott: Yeah, right France and then next time it's time to do a show like that.

457
00:27:26,507 --> 00:27:27,030
Scott: We'll be sitting here.

458
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:27,854
Scott: What do we do a show on?

459
00:27:27,874 --> 00:27:28,155
Scott: duh?

460
00:27:28,175 --> 00:27:28,637
Scott: I don't know.

461
00:27:28,818 --> 00:27:33,075
Scott: remind us in the fall not gonna happen Alright, so check this out, right?

462
00:27:33,537 --> 00:27:35,725
Scott: I'm having some job issues lately.

463
00:27:35,765 --> 00:27:36,568
Scott: Alright, we'll see what goes.

464
00:27:36,608 --> 00:27:37,833
Scott: that you are Of course, I can't.

465
00:27:37,973 --> 00:27:38,194
Scott: I can't.

466
00:27:38,274 --> 00:27:40,002
Scott: I'm not really in danger of losing my job.

467
00:27:40,062 --> 00:27:48,290
Rym: I'm just sort of slightly Gruntled man, every time I think I'm not doing well at my job and all my jobs like man am I doing my job?

468
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:52,730
Rym: I feel like I'm slacking and then my boss always take me aside like I need to speak with you.

469
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:53,513
Rym: It's like ah crap.

470
00:27:53,553 --> 00:27:54,477
Rym: Are they firing me?

471
00:27:54,738 --> 00:27:57,670
Rym: Am I gonna bla bla bla bla, but they always give me a raise or something.

472
00:27:57,832 --> 00:27:58,929
Scott: So yeah anyway.

473
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:08,948
Scott: So there's a lot of things out there Lately that are sort of opportunities for people like me to sort of go out on their own and make software.

474
00:28:08,988 --> 00:28:12,861
Scott: for example Nintendo's WiiWare launched today instead of virtual console games.

475
00:28:12,881 --> 00:28:15,050
Scott: They put the WiiWare out there, which I got to go downstairs.

476
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:15,954
Scott: We got to buy some games.

477
00:28:16,035 --> 00:28:16,638
Rym: Yes, we do.

478
00:28:16,658 --> 00:28:17,863
Scott: Alright, of course, they're gonna.

479
00:28:17,884 --> 00:28:19,230
Scott: I got to buy more stupid Wii points.

480
00:28:19,491 --> 00:28:24,719
Scott: I think I might just buy the big package of Wii points just to make it easier and I could have to keep typing the credit card number in on the Wii.

481
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:30,586
Scott: and The way that works apparently is Nintendo is is according to what I've read.

482
00:28:30,606 --> 00:28:31,590
Scott: They're being very open.

483
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:34,660
Scott: They're saying anyone who wants to make WiiWare go nuts.

484
00:28:34,962 --> 00:28:40,299
Scott: We're just gonna make sure that it's bug-free and We're gonna make sure that it's.

485
00:28:40,339 --> 00:28:41,885
Scott: you know, you have to get it rated by the.

486
00:28:41,925 --> 00:28:43,089
Scott: you know, the the ESRB.

487
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:45,732
Rym: We got to make a goddamn tower defense game I know.

488
00:28:45,772 --> 00:28:49,390
Scott: and then now they said that they'll let they'll put it on there and you choose your price.

489
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:51,884
Scott: I guess you can't do free because I guess they get a cut right.

490
00:28:51,924 --> 00:28:53,815
Scott: but you know I don't know.

491
00:28:53,835 --> 00:28:54,721
Scott: they might let you do free.

492
00:28:54,741 --> 00:28:55,184
Scott: who knows?

493
00:28:55,687 --> 00:29:05,322
Scott: and I'm like Hey I could totally do that if I you know If I quit my job right now and Nintendo gave me the WiiWare kit I could totally make a WiiWare game and that'll be my job.

494
00:29:05,362 --> 00:29:06,527
Scott: I'd live off the WiiWare game.

495
00:29:06,587 --> 00:29:07,370
Scott: That'd be set, right?

496
00:29:08,512 --> 00:29:10,509
Scott: Here's another example, which is my news.

497
00:29:11,571 --> 00:29:15,150
Scott: Rym, are I am not our YM like this person?

498
00:29:15,711 --> 00:29:23,198
Scott: Yeah, right Rym, which is stands for if you didn't know research in motion Blackberry blackberry, they're better known as blackberry.

499
00:29:23,238 --> 00:29:25,927
Scott: If you look at the back of a blackberry, it says Rym on it, right?

500
00:29:26,028 --> 00:29:26,429
Scott: R. I am.

501
00:29:26,569 --> 00:29:30,410
Rym: so Rym, well, my blackberry says R. I am and our YM.

502
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:40,244
Scott: So the blackberry company is launching a 150 million dollar right that's like enough for the rest of my life.

503
00:29:40,264 --> 00:29:42,410
Scott: times a billion not times a billion.

504
00:29:44,411 --> 00:29:46,361
Scott: Venture capitalist fund for mobile apps.

505
00:29:46,401 --> 00:29:52,548
Scott: in other words if you want to make Blackberry applications something Scott can do Scott knows the Java, right?

506
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:53,832
Scott: They'll get.

507
00:29:53,852 --> 00:29:58,130
Scott: they're giving out 150 million dollars to people and companies who are gonna make blackberry apps.

508
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:02,250
Scott: Now one if you give me right a hundred thousand dollars.

509
00:30:02,371 --> 00:30:06,750
Scott: Not even if you give me eighty thousand dollars a small fraction of that hundred and fifty million.

510
00:30:07,312 --> 00:30:12,250
Scott: I can afford to just quit my job and spend an entire year on blackberry applications.

511
00:30:12,451 --> 00:30:15,324
Scott: I could write like ten blackberry applications in a year.

512
00:30:15,344 --> 00:30:19,807
Rym: probably got it right first Interfaces to all the Google stuff that works with domains.

513
00:30:19,968 --> 00:30:20,390
Rym: exactly.

514
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:27,593
Scott: I mean I could do so much I could make like the best blackberry applications known to man if they gave me just 80 grand.

515
00:30:27,613 --> 00:30:29,719
Scott: just give Scott Reuben 80 grand.

516
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:30,702
Scott: I'll quit my job.

517
00:30:30,722 --> 00:30:31,685
Scott: You know what I'll go.

518
00:30:31,765 --> 00:30:33,250
Scott: sit on a brand new computer.

519
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:41,197
Rym: You could probably do it on 40 grand because you could live on 40 grand if you didn't have any commutation expenses Maybe but it would be a little.

520
00:30:41,217 --> 00:30:45,573
Rym: but the thing is remember you you have my bankroll cuz I actually Listeners aside.

521
00:30:45,613 --> 00:30:47,640
Rym: I kind of got a gigantic raise the other day.

522
00:30:47,881 --> 00:30:49,687
Rym: I've been kind of geeky about my job lately.

523
00:30:49,887 --> 00:30:56,850
Scott: Yeah, okay, so Okay, my question is how do I get them to give me this money?

524
00:30:56,910 --> 00:31:00,925
Scott: I mean Apple is giving money to people making iPhone apps if I can get that money.

525
00:31:01,005 --> 00:31:02,230
Scott: I can make iPhone apps, too.

526
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:06,070
Scott: I'll go out and buy an iPhone like tomorrow and start making iPhone apps.

527
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:06,575
Scott: I can make some.

528
00:31:06,595 --> 00:31:13,571
Rym: you should try it look into it And then I get right and then email all the people and then find out there might be like an application or something you can Do.

529
00:31:13,651 --> 00:31:14,715
Scott: how I can't.

530
00:31:14,755 --> 00:31:18,830
Scott: I couldn't even find right there like yeah, we're letting all these developers make we wear apps.

531
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:22,424
Scott: I could not find the we wear dev kit anything right where.

Scott: how do I get in on this stuff?

533
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:25,474
Scott: How do I get these monies?

534
00:31:26,056 --> 00:31:29,530
Scott: I could totally quit my job and just write apps that would like change the world.

535
00:31:30,152 --> 00:31:31,558
Scott: I just I don't know how to get this money.

536
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,566
Scott: I need someone to help me get this money.

Scott: someone helped me out here.

544
00:31:43,081 --> 00:31:50,250
Scott: All right, seriously, I'm not even joking about this Like I would seriously just quit my job and I can take a year off.

545
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:54,687
Scott: I could actually what I do is I write a game right and I would put put the game on.

546
00:31:54,928 --> 00:31:58,550
Scott: we wear iPhone and blackberry I'd make a cross-platform get NDS.

547
00:31:58,931 --> 00:32:01,682
Rym: The scary thing is Scott Alex and I have been working on.

548
00:32:01,902 --> 00:32:05,765
Rym: we haven't actually made a single goddamn game But we have a lot of like.

549
00:32:05,785 --> 00:32:13,582
Rym: pretty much If the three of us had taken time off like we could ever just take time off like a month and work on one of These things instead of doing our normal jobs.

550
00:32:13,924 --> 00:32:15,070
Rym: It'd be done and amazing.

551
00:32:15,292 --> 00:32:21,890
Scott: Yeah, the thing is if someone actually did this I would probably take like a week off and go to Florida and it but then I would come back and then I would do It.

552
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:22,794
Rym: yeah.

553
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:24,700
Scott: Yeah, but anyway, I'm serious.

554
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,985
Scott: I'm dead serious about this.

555
00:32:26,045 --> 00:32:31,665
Scott: Like I am looking at this action I need someone with knowledges to help me get monies from these companies.

556
00:32:32,167 --> 00:32:32,890
Scott: They're giving it out.

557
00:32:33,232 --> 00:32:34,300
Scott: They want someone to write an app.

558
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,730
Scott: I can just giving it away.

559
00:32:35,911 --> 00:32:40,329
Scott: They just need to give me a blackberry dev kit and you'll have blackberry apps probably within the week.

560
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:48,297
Rym: Things of the day.

561
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:51,351
Rym: so a lot not too long ago, you know We play.

562
00:32:51,371 --> 00:32:55,304
Rym: we're playing this burning wheel game on Tuesdays and the burning wheel game is very.

563
00:32:55,324 --> 00:32:58,557
Rym: there's a lot of Roman Empire Inspired stuff in it.

564
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:04,266
Rym: So we were talking and we thought hey What if we all dressed up in period for one of the games?

565
00:33:04,346 --> 00:33:06,314
Rym: and you know We're just a geeky enough group to where?

566
00:33:06,334 --> 00:33:07,558
Rym: that was a very appealing idea.

567
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:08,943
Rym: because oh god.

568
00:33:09,023 --> 00:33:09,485
Rym: Oh god.

569
00:33:09,545 --> 00:33:14,795
Rym: Yes toga party Something that we didn't do in college We're gonna do now.

570
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:18,090
Rym: now that we're like in our mid 20s makes it so much more awesome.

571
00:33:18,231 --> 00:33:18,633
Rym: It does.

572
00:33:18,934 --> 00:33:22,010
Rym: but of course, you know, we were thinking about like yeah, we should actually do the toga party.

573
00:33:22,272 --> 00:33:23,222
Rym: let's actually do this.

574
00:33:23,303 --> 00:33:29,830
Rym: and then Scott and I of course as we always do whenever we think of something like this thought I ain't using no sheet.

575
00:33:30,251 --> 00:33:30,913
Scott: That's right.

576
00:33:31,315 --> 00:33:32,619
Scott: Give me a real toga.

577
00:33:32,639 --> 00:33:34,084
Scott: Hey Internet's now.

578
00:33:34,164 --> 00:33:36,070
Rym: first we looked and we found how to make togas.

579
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:36,733
Rym: It's not that hard.

580
00:33:36,753 --> 00:33:37,959
Rym: This one website was great.

581
00:33:37,999 --> 00:33:39,546
Rym: It was like first off.

582
00:33:39,567 --> 00:33:41,549
Rym: rule number one Don't use a sheet.

583
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:43,877
Rym: Cloth is so cheap.

584
00:33:44,118 --> 00:33:46,550
Rym: Like seriously, dude, go to a craft store.

585
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:49,318
Rym: I don't think you understand how cheap cloth is for real.

586
00:33:49,739 --> 00:33:53,710
Rym: also cloth comes in colors other than bed sheet white or stained bed sheet.

587
00:33:55,236 --> 00:33:56,670
Scott: But so well, that's a good website.

588
00:33:57,073 --> 00:33:58,989
Rym: It is but it is not my thing of the day.

589
00:33:59,471 --> 00:34:00,194
Rym: my thing of the day is.

590
00:34:00,214 --> 00:34:03,205
Rym: then we decided alright because you know the way we always handle.

591
00:34:03,245 --> 00:34:05,638
Rym: getting something like this is we Don't get it.

592
00:34:05,658 --> 00:34:10,469
Rym: if we just plan it we decide Alright, what is the best solution?

593
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:12,010
Rym: Like if money was no object.

594
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:14,275
Rym: Like what is the good solution?

595
00:34:14,315 --> 00:34:16,040
Rym: doesn't mean we're gonna get the best.

596
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,263
Scott: the ultimate solution.

597
00:34:17,484 --> 00:34:19,949
Scott: get like some Hollywood costume making people.

598
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:26,107
Rym: Yes, but then we're like like we figure out what's the best we could do and then we decide if that's worth it Or if we're gonna go cheap.

599
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:33,014
Rym: So we decided alright if I want to just buy a period toga a real one How much would it be?

600
00:34:33,034 --> 00:34:33,777
Rym: and we looked around.

601
00:34:33,797 --> 00:34:37,250
Scott: that's the one that was actually from the period or just a replica?

602
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:38,315
Rym: Well a replica.

603
00:34:38,536 --> 00:34:38,797
Scott: Yes.

604
00:34:38,858 --> 00:34:41,270
Scott: I would like a Roman toga worn by a Roman.

605
00:34:42,511 --> 00:34:47,241
Scott: Yes, well if you robbed the museum You might get it for a while before they catch you.

606
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:51,938
Rym: and we looked on Amazon and they have some cheap Costumes that look like real uncomfortable crap.

607
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:54,810
Scott: Yeah, but one of them looked kind of nice, but it looked uncomfortable.

608
00:34:55,033 --> 00:35:06,070
Rym: Yeah, but then you know I found this website Lorenz nest and this site sells if you're into Greek or Roman stuff and you want to dress the part.

609
00:35:06,613 --> 00:35:09,249
Rym: Good God, do they sell everything you need for a price?

610
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:13,570
Scott: It's not that it's yeah, I wanted the brush helmet and you know what they have the brush how they do.

611
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:14,938
Rym: It's not even that it's been $280.

612
00:35:14,938 --> 00:35:15,542
Scott: You know what though?

613
00:35:17,171 --> 00:35:18,416
Rym: That's less than I expected.

614
00:35:18,457 --> 00:35:19,923
Scott: there is less but it is.

615
00:35:20,023 --> 00:35:27,520
Scott: it's a reasonable price considering that's a real brush helmet or at least a real replica brush helmet, but as Much as I want a brush helmet.

616
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,750
Scott: I don't want one two hundred eighty dollars bad.

617
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:33,729
Rym: well, I think what happened here was you think how much would that cost?

618
00:35:33,749 --> 00:35:38,409
Rym: and $280 is a reasonable price for what that is.

619
00:35:38,791 --> 00:35:43,527
Rym: But our hope was what if our expectation of price is much higher than reality.

620
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:52,250
Rym: It's worth a shot You never know, but this site answered the question and partly because I got that raise I'm kind of thinking about getting one.

621
00:35:53,014 --> 00:36:01,386
Rym: But if you want an authentic like Roman style toga like as they would wear made out of wool or linen.

622
00:36:01,547 --> 00:36:02,430
Rym: I recommend linen.

623
00:36:03,833 --> 00:36:05,060
Rym: They're about 200 bucks.

624
00:36:05,503 --> 00:36:06,509
Scott: That's a little bit too much.

625
00:36:07,051 --> 00:36:09,660
Scott: I'm looking for more like a 50 to 75 dollar toga.

626
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:14,133
Rym: Now if you want the senatorial one, it's 275.

627
00:36:14,133 --> 00:36:21,670
Rym: Now multiple websites have said don't get wool Don't get wool for the love of God do not get wool.

628
00:36:22,393 --> 00:36:24,624
Scott: Are you supposed to wear something under the toga or not?

629
00:36:25,227 --> 00:36:25,709
Rym: I don't know.

630
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:28,101
Rym: Can I don't know a lot about togas to be honest.

631
00:36:28,302 --> 00:36:29,749
Scott: We got to do some toga research.

632
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:32,399
Scott: Is there maybe a toga expert in the audience?

633
00:36:32,419 --> 00:36:35,570
Rym: There is a toga Wikipedia that I'm not going to read now toga.

634
00:36:36,112 --> 00:36:44,504
Rym: But just in case you wondered if you want a semi-authentic Linen toga the nicest one the senatorial one with the lining and everything.

635
00:36:44,805 --> 00:36:45,507
Rym: It's under 300 lining.

636
00:36:47,213 --> 00:36:48,798
Rym: Well, no like the lines on that like it's.

637
00:36:49,099 --> 00:36:52,510
Rym: it's white but it has like nice embroidered lines around all the edges.

638
00:36:52,811 --> 00:36:54,158
Scott: Does it tell you how to put it on?

639
00:36:54,218 --> 00:36:55,002
Scott: is it come with instructions?

640
00:36:55,043 --> 00:36:56,851
Rym: I'm sure there is a website All right.

641
00:36:57,534 --> 00:36:58,256
Rym: So what do you got?

642
00:36:59,019 --> 00:37:02,510
Scott: All right, so I'm using the Twitter a little bit more.

643
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:03,678
Scott: I got this Twitter client.

644
00:37:03,738 --> 00:37:04,181
Rym: Are you a?

645
00:37:04,423 --> 00:37:05,530
Rym: are you a Twitter shitter?

646
00:37:06,171 --> 00:37:10,492
Scott: No, I got the it's like Twitter client that works in Adobe Air Right.

647
00:37:10,532 --> 00:37:17,649
Rym: So I installed the Adobe Air alpha for non-citizens of Rome or forbidden from wearing togas according to Wikipedia in an unsighted sentence.

648
00:37:18,232 --> 00:37:23,311
Scott: Anyway continue and then I. so I got this Twitter client going and then you know It's.

649
00:37:23,371 --> 00:37:27,990
Scott: I'm still not really feeling it, but I'm gonna try to give it more of a chance.

650
00:37:28,231 --> 00:37:31,562
Rym: Oh the Romans were togas differently from the way the Greeks just ignore my thing today.

651
00:37:31,622 --> 00:37:32,827
Rym: Yes continue like you.

652
00:37:33,308 --> 00:37:40,930
Scott: so I Figure, you know if there is something good there I'll give it like a little bit more of a chance before I just forget about it.

653
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:57,241
Scott: So along the way I sort of found this thing that sort of made the rounds today link wise and it basically what it is is if you're getting a package right you type in your tracking number and It'll Twitter you whenever there's a status update on your package.

654
00:37:57,461 --> 00:38:00,738
Rym: That's a. that's one of the best uses of Twitter I've ever seen.

655
00:38:01,001 --> 00:38:04,979
Scott: the thing is It's pretty much this thing has existed.

656
00:38:04,999 --> 00:38:08,230
Scott: There were jabber boss that did this for a longest, but now it's on Twitter.

657
00:38:08,433 --> 00:38:09,489
Scott: Yeah, but now it's on Twitter.

658
00:38:10,771 --> 00:38:11,434
Rym: Why would I want?

659
00:38:11,655 --> 00:38:15,490
Scott: there's no advantage to using this on Twitter versus any other instant message.

660
00:38:15,791 --> 00:38:20,870
Rym: Why not just have a jabber me whatever jabber or aim or you know, what it emails me?

661
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:23,579
Rym: Anyway, I always have Gmail open right you can use.

662
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:27,150
Scott: you can use email or aim or jabber and it's just as good.

663
00:38:27,211 --> 00:38:28,408
Scott: In fact, it's better than Twitter.

664
00:38:28,711 --> 00:38:36,250
Scott: He's better is still more than X because Twitter's slow and Twitter also sort of has this public element And I don't know if you really want to show here.

665
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:39,724
Rym: Yes, Scott's LCD is now on his dad's porch.

666
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:41,251
Rym: Scott doesn't get home until 6.

667
00:38:41,251 --> 00:38:43,090
Rym: In fact Scott just told you he's at work late.

668
00:38:43,512 --> 00:38:46,750
Scott: Yeah, you kind of want your package tracking to be like a private to you thing, right?

669
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:48,215
Scott: So it's sort of like.

670
00:38:48,295 --> 00:38:51,265
Scott: why do this with Twitter other than to get attention?

671
00:38:51,305 --> 00:38:52,750
Scott: because Twitter is the hot thing right now.

672
00:38:53,032 --> 00:38:54,690
Rym: But that's probably the best use.

673
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:59,563
Scott: Yeah, but regardless I am in someone when they're or text messaging when package tracking updates.

674
00:38:59,945 --> 00:39:00,787
Scott: pretty good idea.

675
00:39:00,807 --> 00:39:01,830
Scott: So that's it.

676
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:02,938
Scott: It's just a short thing of the day.

677
00:39:02,998 --> 00:39:09,502
Scott: So togas are worn over loincloths Line cloth the most ancient type of clothing.

678
00:39:09,703 --> 00:39:11,429
Scott: after seashell and leaf.

679
00:39:13,811 --> 00:39:16,458
Scott: It's pretty much leaf seashell lung cloth.

680
00:39:16,499 --> 00:39:17,562
Scott: that well you're forgetting.

681
00:39:17,842 --> 00:39:20,490
Rym: heavy furs gave you an armor class of five.

682
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:24,749
Scott: No, you see the heavy furs were developed in tandem with the loincloth just in different places.

683
00:39:25,633 --> 00:39:33,290
Scott: If you lived in the more tropical close to the equator the close to the equator You got the more odds that it was gonna be loincloth and the small of the law.

684
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:43,390
Rym: You're forgetting the most important element that you did penis gourd Penis gourd penis gourd penis gourd penis gourd was an advancement of one class.

685
00:39:45,534 --> 00:39:53,028
Rym: See you realize that Anyone who doesn't really how else could they gird loins without loin cloths believe you mean gourd loins.

686
00:39:54,912 --> 00:39:58,750
Rym: If anyone doesn't realize why I said penis gourd three-time penis gourd penis gourd penis gourd.

687
00:39:59,572 --> 00:40:00,345
Rym: It's a farc ism.

688
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:06,367
Rym: Anytime the word penis gourd is mentioned someone must say penis gourd penis gourd penis gourd.

689
00:40:06,668 --> 00:40:07,410
Rym: It's kind of a thing.

690
00:40:07,631 --> 00:40:09,120
Rym: All right, that's all I got.

691
00:40:09,361 --> 00:40:10,588
Rym: So it's what are we talking about tonight?

692
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:14,101
Scott: I don't think We're gonna talk about like the history of video cards and such.

693
00:40:14,403 --> 00:40:16,070
Scott: So so check this out, right?

694
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:19,889
Scott: You have a computer computer has the processing which is the processor.

695
00:40:20,271 --> 00:40:21,555
Scott: It has the inputs and the outputs.

696
00:40:21,616 --> 00:40:25,650
Scott: inputs are mice and keyboard outputs or monitors and speakers and all that other sprinters, right?

697
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:27,977
Rym: So what has been blurred a little bit?

698
00:40:27,997 --> 00:40:29,967
Rym: I mean the optimist keyboard is also output.

699
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:30,610
Scott: I know it's crazy.

700
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:37,808
Scott: Yeah So one of the outputs is the monitor but the thing is your computer doesn't really speak.

701
00:40:37,889 --> 00:40:38,230
Scott: monitor.

702
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,774
Scott: I mean your monitor is a television.

703
00:40:40,055 --> 00:40:48,279
Scott: you need to get the computer which is digital zeros and ones to somehow send out an analog Television signal that the TV can understand.

704
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:56,085
Rym: now remember that I mean like the computer revolution what made Computers like modern computers special as opposed to other kinds of purpose-built devices.

705
00:40:56,486 --> 00:40:57,810
Rym: Was that their general purpose?

706
00:40:57,850 --> 00:40:58,713
Rym: You know, that was the whole thing.

707
00:40:58,753 --> 00:41:02,206
Rym: It was a the first general purpose computing device, right?

708
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:03,330
Scott: You had like calculators.

709
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:05,764
Scott: It was a computer that could calculate and couldn't do anything else.

710
00:41:06,166 --> 00:41:11,680
Scott: you had like Synthesizers, it was a computer that could synthesize but it couldn't do much else.

711
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:14,390
Rym: but a computer was a programmable computer.

712
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:20,110
Rym: You could tell it to do basically any series of binary operations and get the results.

713
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:24,305
Scott: Yeah anything that could be done digitally it could do as long as they could get the input in the out.

714
00:41:24,386 --> 00:41:34,290
Rym: now the the real deal Here is that in general if you make the more general you make a piece of hardware the less good It is at any particular tech, right?

715
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:45,407
Scott: If I make a chip right and that chip only does that's specifically designed a piece of hardware physical Specifically designed to say add one and one that is gonna add one and one so fast.

716
00:41:45,488 --> 00:41:46,210
Scott: You have no idea.

717
00:41:48,235 --> 00:41:50,210
Scott: Add one and one so fast, it'll be unbelievable.

718
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:57,310
Scott: But if I make a chip that can add any numbers It's gonna add one and one a little bit slower than the one in one chip.

719
00:41:57,671 --> 00:42:04,959
Scott: Right if I make a chip that can you know do anything in the world like an Intel, you know core to duo It's still wicked fast.

720
00:42:04,999 --> 00:42:17,627
Rym: just because we have wicked fast now We're definitely oversimplified because general-purpose computers tend to take complex tasks and then break them down into smaller tasks and you multiply by doing One and one and one and one and one or maybe you have a special purpose build thing.

721
00:42:17,667 --> 00:42:18,230
Rym: in the process.

722
00:42:19,312 --> 00:42:20,457
Rym: You're multiplying two majors.

723
00:42:20,477 --> 00:42:22,587
Rym: people actually know that's what mostly what video cards do.

724
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:23,109
Scott: right, right.

725
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:30,930
Scott: So anyway, the point is is that you have to have this part of the computer that converts digital to what the monitor speaks.

726
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:46,807
Scott: Because even if the monitor is a digital monitor like using a DVI cable or an HDMI cable The monitor still it's still a different, you know language you need some part of the computer to convert, you know Sort of the the frame buffer, which is pretty much just.

727
00:42:47,048 --> 00:42:53,928
Scott: you're like, okay I'm not gonna explain frame buffers But it's pretty much a piece of memory and in that memory is a picture of what the screen should look like.

728
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:59,810
Scott: right now You need something to convert that which is what the computer speaks into what the monitor speaks.

729
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:03,610
Scott: So in back in the day, all you had was on the motherboard.

730
00:43:03,891 --> 00:43:09,614
Scott: They'd be like a chip that would take the frame buffer and turn it into a TV signal and then there'd be a wire coming Out of that.

731
00:43:09,836 --> 00:43:10,582
Scott: they'll go to the TV.

732
00:43:11,166 --> 00:43:11,449
Scott: All right.

733
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:16,288
Scott: Then over time it got a little more complex, you know, you know VGA.

734
00:43:16,348 --> 00:43:20,410
Scott: eventually We get higher resolutions, right and things are getting pretty complicated.

735
00:43:21,293 --> 00:43:33,459
Scott: then what sort of happened was people wanted to do things like watch videos right or do 3d stuff right and Those are very complicated tasks.

736
00:43:33,479 --> 00:43:43,509
Scott: and having the CPU, you know that was doing everything else The computer was doing also do these complicated tasks was sort of burdening it and it was getting really slow.

737
00:43:43,529 --> 00:43:44,933
Rym: now There's actually there's another.

738
00:43:44,954 --> 00:43:56,110
Rym: I mean, there's another factor here and that it just so happens that a task like doing video Tends to be very computationally intensive in a very narrow band of computations.

739
00:43:56,290 --> 00:44:05,521
Scott: Yep, it also just so happened that these tasks like watching video and doing 3d stuff like 3d games Were very popular among regular everyday people.

740
00:44:05,541 --> 00:44:17,750
Scott: I mean there are other, you know, especially designed Hardware bits such as you know, you can Remember when there was the math coprocessor exactly exactly, right?

741
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:21,250
Scott: You know if you go get some like wicked science computer, right?

742
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:27,443
Scott: It probably has all these special science cards in it that do special science stuff But those aren't things that normal people want to do.

743
00:44:27,504 --> 00:44:28,450
Rym: I mean remember we're talking.

744
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:30,670
Rym: I mean, we're not only talking about the video card.

745
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:34,922
Rym: But the video card is just a purpose-built kind of extension and it's not like.

746
00:44:35,263 --> 00:44:42,306
Rym: I mean modern video cards are a relatively new thing But similar add-ons to computers have existed for almost as long as the sound card, right?

747
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:47,810
Scott: It's a. it's a special chip because a lot of people wanted sound to come out of their computers.

748
00:44:48,332 --> 00:44:59,310
Scott: So because that was such a common thing rather than have the CPU do all the work of sound They made a special sound chip You know Which is also an analog conversion kind of thing and you would put that in there separately.

749
00:44:59,732 --> 00:45:03,568
Scott: That way your computer could do really good things with sound without burdening the CPU.

750
00:45:04,513 --> 00:45:16,074
Scott: So video is the same kind of thing and they eventually came out with a special Video card as opposed to just having you know a video chip on your motherboard and at first they were kind of hokey Like I remember.

751
00:45:16,094 --> 00:45:27,210
Scott: there were even some where you would take the video cable from your regular video card Send it into the special video card then from the special video card to the monitor and it was really kind of crazy.

752
00:45:27,331 --> 00:45:30,009
Scott: Need special drivers and it got way weird.

753
00:45:30,563 --> 00:45:36,573
Scott: but Eventually, they just sort of said All right, we're gonna have a you know PCI slots.

754
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:46,794
Scott: you just put this video card in your computer and you plug the monitor into that and the computer will make sure to Use that as the ma as the video instead of you know Whatever is on the motherboard.

755
00:45:46,814 --> 00:45:51,330
Scott: and then they weren't even putting video cards on motherboards anymore, which you know use like unthinkable.

756
00:45:51,892 --> 00:45:54,620
Scott: You know, you would actually have to have a special video card.

757
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:55,723
Scott: You couldn't have.

758
00:45:55,963 --> 00:45:59,139
Scott: you couldn't plug your monitor directly into your motherboard it didn't work anymore.

759
00:46:00,168 --> 00:46:05,630
Scott: and You know over time it, you know, it got sort of crazy now in the early days, right?

760
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:07,373
Scott: They sort of had.

761
00:46:07,393 --> 00:46:16,001
Scott: you know Nvidia was there pretty early ATI was there pretty early Matrox was there really early and so was voodoo.

762
00:46:16,201 --> 00:46:17,766
Scott: I don't people remember the voodoo's right?

763
00:46:18,187 --> 00:46:19,350
Rym: Ah the voodoo I knew better.

764
00:46:19,591 --> 00:46:26,259
Scott: Yeah, I knew better than to buy into that crap and in the early days Voodoo was sort of the popular deal.

765
00:46:26,379 --> 00:46:33,307
Scott: right matrox was pretty popular because they could do Dual monitors and they could do 2d stuff that the other people couldn't do.

766
00:46:33,367 --> 00:46:38,105
Scott: like, you know If you wanted to monitors matrox is the only way to go pretty much and if you want.

767
00:46:38,125 --> 00:46:40,153
Rym: if you were doing like 2d design Or anything.

768
00:46:40,494 --> 00:46:43,308
Rym: matrix cards were like the god cards.

769
00:46:43,549 --> 00:46:47,075
Scott: Yep and also the ATI Wasn't really popular.

770
00:46:47,135 --> 00:46:52,430
Scott: ATI was sort of what you got if you bought a computer with a built-in card like they had that market cornered.

771
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:57,270
Scott: Like if you bought a computer, you know for that was already put together like a Dell or something or an IBM.

772
00:46:57,731 --> 00:46:58,834
Scott: ATI was in there already.

773
00:46:59,516 --> 00:47:05,694
Scott: Nvidia was sort of like, you know, you want to do the 3d business with OpenGL and Voodoo.

774
00:47:05,875 --> 00:47:08,230
Scott: was you want to do the 3d business with glide?

775
00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:16,698
Scott: now back in the day glide was actually pretty hot because the voodoo cards are really popular and We're not gonna explain exactly what that was.

776
00:47:16,718 --> 00:47:19,930
Rym: We're not gonna explain what show on OpenGL will be required.

777
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:24,229
Scott: All you have to know is that the voodoo cards use glide and the Nvidia cards use OpenGL.

778
00:47:24,732 --> 00:47:33,350
Rym: A layman's way of putting it is that the voodoo cards Basically had kind of half-assed OpenGL in order to make it affordable.

779
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:38,932
Rym: Yeah, and it was really fast, but it was also pretty Shitty.

780
00:47:39,072 --> 00:47:41,399
Scott: Yeah, but anyway you say you would buy games.

781
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:46,930
Scott: right and the games like you'd buy a game and it would say yeah Okay, this game supports glide.

782
00:47:47,353 --> 00:47:49,930
Scott: So if you had like glide card like a voodoo card.

783
00:47:50,251 --> 00:47:53,590
Scott: Then you would get the card to help you out on that game and the game be cool.

784
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:56,350
Rym: I mean, I remember so we didn't have a glide card.

785
00:47:56,410 --> 00:47:57,616
Scott: Like you've got an Nvidia card.

786
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:00,390
Scott: then that game wouldn't be helped by that Nvidia cards.

787
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:02,348
Scott: You needed to have a card that went with your games.

788
00:48:02,631 --> 00:48:11,584
Rym: But I remember so clearly like back in the day There was quake the first modern 3d FPS Even though I consider quake 2 to be the first like playable modern 3d.

789
00:48:11,624 --> 00:48:13,108
Scott: quake 1 was the first 3d FPS.

790
00:48:13,892 --> 00:48:14,479
Rym: Yes, but it was.

791
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,349
Rym: it was kind of awful.

792
00:48:15,591 --> 00:48:20,410
Scott: It was a bad game, but the mods were good technology technology wise that it was, you know, the first one.

793
00:48:20,490 --> 00:48:25,267
Scott: Yep, you got to explore a brown castle and you got to look up and down and left and right.

794
00:48:25,307 --> 00:48:28,497
Scott: you could aim in every Direction walk in every direction, but jump.

795
00:48:28,718 --> 00:48:30,042
Rym: Yeah, that is problems.

796
00:48:30,302 --> 00:48:39,029
Scott: But then, you know, there was an add-on that you could get GL quake and that if you had a GL cards if you had a voodoo card you were SOL.

797
00:48:39,612 --> 00:48:43,550
Rym: Well, not really, but we'll talk about that when we do the OpenGL show.

798
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:47,026
Scott: But if you had an Nvidia card GL quake all suddenly, it was awesome.

799
00:48:47,146 --> 00:48:49,512
Rym: See the thing is Actual.

800
00:48:49,753 --> 00:48:52,406
Rym: true OpenGL support was not common early on.

801
00:48:52,526 --> 00:48:53,330
Scott: it was very difficult.

802
00:48:53,370 --> 00:48:57,069
Rym: You had to install GL things and and also a lot of car just didn't support it.

803
00:48:57,210 --> 00:49:00,550
Scott: Yeah, it pretty much everything sucked in those days sucked hard.

804
00:49:00,873 --> 00:49:07,130
Scott: There were also like s3 cards Like I remember there was a point at which like if you had an s3 card then descent 2 would be helped out by it.

805
00:49:07,230 --> 00:49:10,870
Scott: But nothing else really and it was bad times bad times.

806
00:49:11,251 --> 00:49:12,838
Scott: But that's what you had to do if you wanted to.

807
00:49:13,139 --> 00:49:22,630
Scott: you know, have you know the 3d games, you know People had to write the 3d game using a specific 3d language to talk to the specific card and all the cards are different.

808
00:49:22,931 --> 00:49:31,849
Scott: You need to match it up, you know, but eventually things got better mostly because DirectX, you know and everyone started just doing direct 3d or OpenGL and that was pretty much the only choices.

809
00:49:31,869 --> 00:49:34,516
Scott: and It narrowed down over time.

810
00:49:34,556 --> 00:49:35,118
Scott: and voodoo.

811
00:49:35,338 --> 00:49:42,950
Scott: they were stupid and they went away right because instead of improving their technology They just made cars that had more and more chips on them without actually making better chips.

812
00:49:43,331 --> 00:49:44,255
Scott: So they got canned.

813
00:49:44,456 --> 00:49:46,967
Scott: the voodoo 3 was a stinker and they never made it anywhere else.

814
00:49:47,268 --> 00:49:48,733
Rym: there were Problems.

815
00:49:48,814 --> 00:49:50,121
Scott: I remember there was a voodoo card.

816
00:49:50,141 --> 00:49:51,810
Scott: They were like, yeah, this voodoo card is so crazy.

817
00:49:51,830 --> 00:49:53,050
Scott: It's like eight chips on it.

818
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:56,890
Scott: You get to plug it into the wall on its own like there'd be a power cord coming out of your video card.

819
00:49:57,333 --> 00:49:59,510
Scott: And I was like that's never gonna fly and it never flew.

820
00:49:59,731 --> 00:50:00,535
Rym: Yeah, but we're not.

821
00:50:00,595 --> 00:50:11,629
Scott: I mean a lot of that is for other shows at other times But I mean it narrowed down to where is pretty much just ATI and Nvidia and the difference between the two is this Nvidia was a little better with the OpenGL's.

822
00:50:12,611 --> 00:50:15,859
Scott: ATI was a little better direct 3ds until very recently.

823
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:32,620
Scott: Nvidia had great drivers and ATI had garbage drivers pretty much and also The Nvidia was a little bit more money for it sort of varied like which one had the better price to performance ratio But Nvidia tended to be a little bit behind on that.

824
00:50:33,162 --> 00:50:34,667
Scott: The other thing was that the ATI.

825
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:38,322
Scott: ATI made the ATI cards.

826
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:43,950
Scott: if you wanted an ATI chip You bought a card that was made by ATI and that was your option.

827
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:44,954
Scott: That was the only option.

828
00:50:45,436 --> 00:50:50,776
Scott: Nvidia just made the chips and anyone in the world could make Nvidia cards like.

829
00:50:50,856 --> 00:50:59,202
Scott: my first video card was a TNT to made by diamond But it had a you know, it had the first Nvidia TNT to chip on it, right?

830
00:50:59,322 --> 00:51:03,659
Rym: Well, I had my creative graphics blaster Extreme and what?

831
00:51:03,719 --> 00:51:04,745
Scott: what kind of ship was on there?

832
00:51:05,026 --> 00:51:18,875
Scott: I don't remember yeah, but Nvidia made chips and other people made the cards right and From there, they just sort of had a race and they kept raising and raising and raising until where we are today which is where you know.

833
00:51:18,895 --> 00:51:22,968
Scott: for a time Nvidia had superior Linux support and I still think they do.

834
00:51:23,068 --> 00:51:30,350
Scott: but a AMD ATAT merged and a ATI sort of released all this driver stuff to the Linux people.

835
00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:34,790
Scott: So the ATI driver is getting way better, you know, the open source ones getting way better, you know.

836
00:51:34,870 --> 00:51:40,724
Scott: So at that that department is sort of sorted itself out You know, and that's I guess that's really the history of video cards.

837
00:51:40,744 --> 00:51:41,949
Scott: I mean, what else is there to say about it?

838
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:45,790
Rym: Yeah, kind of a cop-out show, but we had a lot to say in the beginning about unrelated things.

839
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:49,170
Scott: Yeah things you probably didn't know about like the early days of the video card and stuff.

840
00:51:49,210 --> 00:52:05,716
Rym: I mean, I guess my question to you is Of all the things we touched on briefly What among there are you interested in because we could do a show on OpenGL Talk about like what OpenGL is what DirectX or just 3d acceleration in general We could talk about.

841
00:52:05,736 --> 00:52:08,829
Rym: I guess on Tuesday that the full history of FPS is.

842
00:52:09,111 --> 00:52:13,698
Scott: Yep, the thing you really just need to know is that you know It's they need.

843
00:52:13,758 --> 00:52:15,187
Scott: people wanted to do 3d.

844
00:52:16,031 --> 00:52:17,998
Scott: A lot of people wanted to do it in their computers.

845
00:52:18,339 --> 00:52:21,830
Scott: the CPU couldn't be bothered because CPUs are really expensive.

846
00:52:22,232 --> 00:52:23,115
Scott: You couldn't have two of them.

847
00:52:23,135 --> 00:52:23,778
Scott: That's crazy.

848
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:29,402
Scott: And if you had the CPU do the 3d It'd be really slow and shitty because it had to do other things at the same time.

849
00:52:29,582 --> 00:52:32,213
Rym: now one one bit of practical knowledge Pretty much.

850
00:52:32,935 --> 00:52:35,884
Rym: if you're not a gamer it matters very little.

851
00:52:35,965 --> 00:52:40,862
Rym: it matters pretty much not like nowadays Unless you're a gamer you really don't care.

852
00:52:40,882 --> 00:52:42,147
Rym: What kind of video got?

853
00:52:42,167 --> 00:52:42,850
Scott: the cheapest one?

854
00:52:43,310 --> 00:52:45,178
Rym: Yeah, George, just use the one built into your motherboard.

855
00:52:45,239 --> 00:52:45,640
Rym: It'll work.

856
00:52:45,741 --> 00:52:45,982
Scott: Yeah.

857
00:52:46,002 --> 00:52:47,750
Scott: Well, you have to get a motherboard that has them built in.

858
00:52:47,971 --> 00:52:59,469
Scott: Yeah, that's actually a really good option if you don't care, but you know They made a special chip that would do just the graphics and then they wrote the games and the drivers to make it happen.

859
00:52:59,870 --> 00:53:00,597
Scott: and That's that's.

860
00:53:00,779 --> 00:53:10,378
Rym: that's the way it is This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

861
00:53:10,398 --> 00:53:12,584
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music.

877
00:54:20,102 --> 00:54:21,606
Scott: But unlike those other late shows.

878
00:54:21,907 --> 00:54:23,210
Scott: It's actually recorded at night.
