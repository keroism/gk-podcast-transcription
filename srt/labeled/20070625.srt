1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,748
Rym: It's Monday June 25th.

2
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:12,832
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,852 --> 00:00:18,919
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights Tonight we talk about firewalls.

4
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:25,375
Rym: Let's do this.

5
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:34,069
Scott: The second mocha that we went to I'm sure it's not the second mocha ever.

6
00:00:34,812 --> 00:00:37,623
Rym: Well as far as we're concerned it is I'm sure okay.

7
00:00:38,145 --> 00:00:38,667
Scott: Yeah, it's.

8
00:00:38,807 --> 00:00:39,510
Scott: it's nice and done.

9
00:00:39,792 --> 00:00:41,768
Scott: It was the high quality as expected.

10
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:45,550
Rym: yep We got to hang out with a lot of awesome podcasters at the awesome after party.

11
00:00:45,611 --> 00:00:47,010
Rym: But we'll talk about all that on Wednesday.

12
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:52,207
Scott: Yeah, I mean I got to buy a lot of stuff But I kind of regret not buying some things that were there.

13
00:00:52,347 --> 00:00:59,250
Rym: I spent Every single dollar that I had on me, and then I borrowed 10 bucks from Scott to buy one more thing.

14
00:00:59,391 --> 00:01:09,610
Scott: Yeah, I would have liked to walk around it one more time, but oh well Seeing is how many people had the exact same stuff and the exact same tables and the exact same spot as last year.

15
00:01:10,133 --> 00:01:12,144
Scott: I'll just go again next year get whatever I missed.

16
00:01:12,385 --> 00:01:12,969
Rym: yeah, yeah.

17
00:01:13,952 --> 00:01:23,059
Scott: But also on Sunday the the Visigoths came over to play D&D yep, and they didn't make as many Hidden damages they have in the past.

18
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:28,842
Rym: I didn't find any broken glasses for the first time ever Wow, but they they were not perfect by any means.

19
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:36,866
Rym: no I particularly like how they left Boxes full of unrinsed soda cans on the floor by the door just waiting for the ants to come.

20
00:01:37,348 --> 00:01:38,190
Scott: oh that was just awesome.

21
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,635
Rym: Yeah I was glad to come home to that.

22
00:01:39,815 --> 00:01:45,437
Scott: and how about all those people who weigh over a hundred and fifty pounds sitting in the 150 pound weight limit?

23
00:01:45,457 --> 00:01:45,759
Scott: video?

24
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:52,750
Rym: right yes, we I mean we like the video rocker But there isn't really an adult video rocker that isn't either overpriced or crap.

25
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:59,418
Rym: so as a result Scott and I bought the children's video rockers, which are fine because Combined we weigh less than 300.

26
00:01:59,418 --> 00:02:01,326
Rym: We worry about 300 pounds combined.

27
00:02:01,366 --> 00:02:12,410
Rym: We don't weigh so much yeah, but a lot of people weigh a lot more than us and those video rockers can't hold so much weight and They're basically they've been all but destroyed by our friends over the last couple of years.

28
00:02:12,892 --> 00:02:16,352
Scott: We should just go buy some high-quality ones and say no one's allowed to sit in them But us.

29
00:02:16,533 --> 00:02:18,005
Rym: I've already told people not to sit in them.

30
00:02:18,025 --> 00:02:18,630
Rym: They do anyway.

31
00:02:18,891 --> 00:02:25,390
Rym: Yeah, even better someone in sitting in the video rocker improperly happened to also fall backwards and break my piano.

32
00:02:25,932 --> 00:02:26,434
Scott: They can pay.

33
00:02:26,454 --> 00:02:28,122
Rym: yeah, well I can fix it.

34
00:02:28,142 --> 00:02:29,849
Rym: It's just the pedestal is cracked a little bit.

35
00:02:30,131 --> 00:02:33,830
Rym: Yeah, the PI I can't get it fixed just because that thing's ancient.

36
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:38,790
Scott: They don't make it anymore and the people yell at us like we're somehow mean when we yell at them for messing up.

37
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:43,290
Rym: I think we're gonna have to go back to the strategy of not letting people bring stuff into our house when they visit.

38
00:02:43,592 --> 00:02:46,289
Scott: Yeah, keep everything that belongs to you in your car.

39
00:02:46,571 --> 00:02:50,910
Rym: Well, at least when they all visit if we bring one person over there's no trouble when they all come that's right.

40
00:02:51,494 --> 00:02:53,410
Scott: And we got to take pictures of the house.

41
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:57,450
Scott: We got a duct tape shut all ever all the cabinets and everything so they can't use our stuff.

42
00:02:57,701 --> 00:03:08,209
Scott: Yeah and then we take pictures of the house before they come and then we just Detain them illegally and don't let them leave until the house looks the same way It does in the pictures and if they break anything they got to pay for it.

43
00:03:08,712 --> 00:03:11,590
Rym: Luckily this time I pretty much kept everyone out of my room.

44
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,465
Rym: I mean one person slept on the blue chair as a result.

45
00:03:14,505 --> 00:03:15,370
Rym: My room was untouched.

46
00:03:15,993 --> 00:03:19,350
Rym: I don't think guests are ever sleeping in this room again, except maybe in the blue chair.

47
00:03:20,131 --> 00:03:28,410
Scott: Yeah, my room also is untouched except I had to like move a whole bunch of stuff out of the way and then well Yeah, well the stuff you moved out of the way was the gigantic mess of yours.

48
00:03:28,551 --> 00:03:30,102
Scott: Anyway, it's just a pile of dirty clothes.

49
00:03:30,142 --> 00:03:31,190
Scott: It's all that's ever on my floor.

50
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,724
Rym: I don't know how you get this pile of dirty clothes on the floor.

51
00:03:33,764 --> 00:03:34,468
Rym: Don't you have a hamper?

52
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:39,750
Scott: Basically, what happens right is I do some laundry and then I don't put the laundry away.

53
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:44,210
Scott: So the baskets with the clean laundry are on the floor and I don't have time to put the laundry away.

54
00:03:44,311 --> 00:03:45,985
Scott: So the clean laundry sits in the basket.

55
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:46,490
Rym: Wait a minute.

56
00:03:46,972 --> 00:03:47,714
Rym: So what you're saying?

57
00:03:47,734 --> 00:03:52,008
Rym: that you don't have time to put one baskets worth of laundry.

58
00:03:52,028 --> 00:03:54,294
Rym: Oh Two baskets.

59
00:03:54,736 --> 00:03:56,545
Scott: No, not until a weekend comes around.

60
00:03:56,565 --> 00:03:57,530
Scott: I don't have time to do laundry.

61
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:00,209
Scott: I got to do what I only did half my laundry the last time.

62
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:02,158
Rym: Does it take you to put laundry away?

63
00:04:02,178 --> 00:04:04,810
Scott: It takes less than five minutes takes me a lot of time.

64
00:04:05,031 --> 00:04:10,590
Scott: How you don't even fold things the way I do cuz I got a lot of compartments and I got to sort it all out.

65
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:12,530
Rym: It doesn't take that long.

66
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,837
Rym: You might I'm gonna have to.

67
00:04:13,897 --> 00:04:16,390
Rym: it's gonna be like that Seinfeld where they taught Kramer out of shower.

68
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,798
Rym: I'm gonna teach you out of a clothes away.

69
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:19,670
Scott: You wanna put my clothes away be my guest.

70
00:04:19,831 --> 00:04:22,850
Rym: No, I'll just stand there and watch you do it and point out ways you could do it faster.

71
00:04:23,553 --> 00:04:31,354
Rym: I'm not like in a rush Whatever, you know a Kramer how he washed each individual part of his body and then rinsed it instead of doing the whole wash And then the whole rinse.

72
00:04:31,635 --> 00:04:31,936
Rym: Yeah.

73
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:33,464
Rym: Yeah, I think I might be.

74
00:04:33,544 --> 00:04:34,609
Rym: are you going like sock?

75
00:04:35,831 --> 00:04:41,173
Scott: sock no Underwear Sock, no, I'm not doing that.

76
00:04:41,213 --> 00:04:43,938
Rym: Do you sort your socks by length size color and dirtiness?

77
00:04:44,078 --> 00:04:45,020
Scott: All my socks are the same.

78
00:04:45,982 --> 00:04:47,057
Rym: How can it take so long?

79
00:04:48,061 --> 00:04:50,481
Scott: It's not Whatever.

80
00:04:50,942 --> 00:04:56,260
Scott: my other problem is I do lots of laundry less often as opposed to if we had a dryer.

81
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,286
Scott: It would be much better off.

82
00:04:57,668 --> 00:04:57,769
Rym: Now.

83
00:04:57,809 --> 00:05:07,638
Rym: The best part of all of this is that There's one person in our group will do people who always kind of say hey We should run D&D at our house sometime and even though while their house is really nice.

84
00:05:07,658 --> 00:05:08,843
Rym: They have a basement It's not really.

85
00:05:08,863 --> 00:05:11,654
Rym: it doesn't have one big room for D&D like we do.

86
00:05:11,834 --> 00:05:13,099
Scott: Yeah, you need a big room.

87
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,009
Rym: Our house isn't even big enough for D&D.

88
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:25,013
Rym: No, it's not, you know big room with a big table But at the same time I'd love to have D&D there because then it's I don't have to deal with the Visigoths anymore Yeah, but maybe they won't mess up their house.

89
00:05:25,597 --> 00:05:27,446
Rym: Yeah I don't know.

90
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:28,294
Rym: I don't know.

91
00:05:28,638 --> 00:05:32,720
Rym: Yeah Oh, well, we'll see how many of them listen and then try to complain to us when we make fun of them on the air.

92
00:05:33,562 --> 00:05:43,609
Rym: I think the real plan is next time we have a bunch of people over We'll just quietly keep track of who breaks what and when and who makes what mess and we'll just call you out on the air With your real names, that sounds good to me.

93
00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:44,432
Rym: I like that plan.

94
00:05:44,633 --> 00:05:45,155
Rym: It's okay.

95
00:05:45,296 --> 00:05:46,180
Rym: I'd sort of gotten the news.

96
00:05:46,923 --> 00:05:51,100
Scott: So this is really really good essay written by Dana Boyd.

97
00:05:51,622 --> 00:06:01,092
Scott: I saw it on this blog many too many that I read and it's a. it's a group web blog on social Software and it basically posts, you know, there's all these big thinkers.

98
00:06:01,112 --> 00:06:06,511
Scott: They're always thinking about blog is fears and Folksonomies and all those sorts of things.

99
00:06:06,772 --> 00:06:07,154
Scott: Uh-huh.

100
00:06:07,214 --> 00:06:14,840
Scott: I'm always dubious of those people I know but they write all their essays on the web 2.0s and all that business and you know while they're not a hundred percent.

101
00:06:14,981 --> 00:06:16,185
Scott: Right, you know, they're.

102
00:06:16,205 --> 00:06:18,413
Scott: they're always very intellectually interesting.

103
00:06:18,493 --> 00:06:20,159
Rym: Not everyone can be GeekNights.

104
00:06:23,061 --> 00:06:23,724
Scott: It's generally very.

105
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:25,512
Scott: it's just an interesting blog to read.

106
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:29,999
Scott: if you if you're interested in what's you know Where the web and social networking and things are taking us?

107
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:37,560
Scott: No, and they posted one today by Dana Boyd called viewing American class divisions through Facebook and myspace.

108
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:44,945
Scott: now I'm not gonna go over all the details in it because well you can just read the essay and if I try to Summarize it for you.

109
00:06:44,965 --> 00:06:46,875
Scott: You'll be like, well, what about this little bit?

110
00:06:46,895 --> 00:06:47,820
Scott: And what about that little bit?

111
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,029
Scott: And I'm like, well the person wrote it.

112
00:06:49,089 --> 00:06:49,593
Scott: I'm not gonna.

113
00:06:49,613 --> 00:06:56,440
Rym: well, I didn't read it But I'm gonna hazard a guess that the general line is low-class myspace high-class Facebook.

114
00:06:56,561 --> 00:06:57,535
Scott: That's pretty much what it is.

115
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:08,524
Scott: What I like about this article and why I want people to read it is because first of all, they separate class not by money, but by Class.

116
00:07:08,564 --> 00:07:14,640
Scott: the way we talk about class, you know, like Rym always says our class system Yep, I'm classes, but that has nothing to do with money, right?

117
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,281
Scott: And there's this.

118
00:07:15,562 --> 00:07:29,268
Scott: this essay actually contains a really great explanation about how his friends making $14,000 a year in cafes are not the same class as the immigrant janitor in Oakland Even though they make the same amount of money.

119
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:32,120
Scott: and it's like, you know class doesn't have to do with money.

120
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:39,374
Scott: It has to do with your culture and your attitude and your lifestyle These other things that are up to you in a modern Western capitalism.

121
00:07:39,554 --> 00:07:41,120
Scott: Yeah, we're talking about America here.

122
00:07:41,662 --> 00:07:48,018
Scott: This is the reason I don't want to go ever everything in the article because it's like every time you're gonna be like Oh, I'm gonna say another word to shut you up now.

123
00:07:48,481 --> 00:07:49,990
Rym: Yeah, cuz I got a bunch of but what about?

124
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:50,534
Rym: but what about?

125
00:07:50,594 --> 00:07:51,138
Rym: but what about?

126
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:54,050
Scott: yep But it goes on to point out how he's got.

127
00:07:54,352 --> 00:08:00,538
Scott: he separates like the hegemonic teens Right who are like they're like us, you know the college going, you know.

128
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:13,448
Scott: Well off, you know, I'm gonna go to college and get a job and be awesome teens from the you know, I'm You know Like most of my friends in high school.

129
00:08:13,648 --> 00:08:15,134
Scott: Yeah, pretty much any.

130
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:16,759
Scott: I forget what he calls those teens.

131
00:08:16,799 --> 00:08:17,155
Rym: God You know.

132
00:08:17,702 --> 00:08:25,868
Rym: I realize that it's not gonna be too long until my 10 year high school reunion comes up and they talk about how You know the the way that Facebook went along.

133
00:08:25,908 --> 00:08:37,530
Scott: where it started out is college only and then college guys could invite High-school people and then they opened it up and how that created a you know A dichotomy between who used Facebook and who use myspace

134
00:08:37,792 --> 00:08:39,659
Rym: definitely different from the or cut path

135
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:51,270
Scott: Yeah, and also how the visual aesthetic of you know Facebook with its clean, you know shiny Usable interface and myspace with its.

136
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:53,599
Scott: I don't think we're doing talk about myspace.

137
00:08:54,162 --> 00:08:55,489
Rym: My space is.

138
00:08:55,509 --> 00:09:15,460
Rym: I don't know how many of you are old enough to remember Back when you could have a geocities website with your one megabyte of space and if you didn't know HTML You could edit your web page with this horrible Java something based editor That basically made the early aesthetic of myspace all over your geocities.

139
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:23,040
Scott: Yep, but anyway, it talks about how that sort of bling he actually uses the word bling a gaudy immature.

140
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,625
Scott: Yeah, yeah bling.

141
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:28,820
Scott: these teens are very aware of myspace and they often have a negative opinion about it.

142
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:36,400
Scott: They see it as gaudy immature and so middle school They prefer the clean look of Facebook noting that is more mature and that myspace is just so lame.

143
00:09:36,883 --> 00:09:44,936
Scott: and that's basically what this our essay gets into and I agree with it over 90% and I think everyone should read it to.

144
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:53,020
Scott: you know I guess better understand what we talk about when we say class as opposed to money class.

145
00:09:53,722 --> 00:10:00,440
Rym: So Google didn't really stand up to China so much but they've stood up to China more than say Yahoo quite a bit more.

146
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:06,980
Rym: In fact, I generally dislike Yahoo because they tend to kowtow to every whim and demand of the Chinese government.

147
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:13,219
Rym: But Google pretty much holds the line as hard as they can hold it while still being able to offer Google in China.

148
00:10:14,202 --> 00:10:25,720
Rym: However, there are other countries in the world countries that also have beasts with Google and I note that Google is generally Willing to just give them the finger or in fact to go one step further and actively threaten them.

149
00:10:25,961 --> 00:10:30,640
Scott: Well what it comes down to is, you know, it's simply a Machiavellian kind of thing.

150
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,760
Scott: It's like Google needs China more than China needs Google.

151
00:10:33,861 --> 00:10:37,060
Scott: So Google bows down to China in exchange of mountains of money.

152
00:10:37,301 --> 00:10:41,500
Rym: But in this case Germany needs Google more than Google needs Germany.

153
00:10:41,781 --> 00:10:45,200
Scott: So when Germany tries to boss Google around it ain't happening.

154
00:10:45,501 --> 00:10:54,040
Rym: It's kind of like when a bunch of South American countries got mad at Google over the or cut Fiasco where they claim that there was pedophilia and child porn and drug selling.

155
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,465
Scott: I wonder who put that there.

156
00:10:55,485 --> 00:11:01,264
Rym: Oh, yeah, but they wanted Google to make do all these things that Google decided They weren't comfortable with.

157
00:11:01,304 --> 00:11:05,200
Rym: they said, you know what now come back with court orders and whatever and nothing came of it.

158
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,548
Rym: But basically the German government is.

159
00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:09,250
Rym: they have a law.

160
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:26,275
Rym: they haven't passed it apparently, but it's some sort of German internet Surveillance law that basically says that any data that goes over the internet or phone calls or anything like that Has to be saved for six months and anonymizing things like Tor are illegal.

161
00:11:26,295 --> 00:11:32,979
Rym: and it's basically this really 1984 watch what people do on the internet and keep records of it thing that I don't want to get into.

162
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,100
Rym: that.

163
00:11:33,141 --> 00:11:33,738
Rym: That's not the news.

164
00:11:34,121 --> 00:11:37,033
Rym: I don't really want to talk about the ramifications of it or why.

165
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,559
Rym: I don't care because I encrypt everything.

166
00:11:38,619 --> 00:11:52,615
Rym: but no the issue here is that Google offers Gmail and When they basically said if this law gets passed They're probably just going to give Germany the finger and shut down Gmail in Germany rather than comply with these outrageous demand.

167
00:11:52,696 --> 00:11:53,360
Scott: that really sucks.

168
00:11:53,460 --> 00:12:03,336
Rym: If you're a German Gmail user who doesn't want to change your email address Well, maybe if you're a German Gmail user You should be writing to whatever your body of government is which I'll admit.

169
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:05,455
Rym: I don't actually know actually going on.

170
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:11,449
Rym: But robot Hitler's are always popular.

171
00:12:12,353 --> 00:12:13,878
Rym: You gotta go with the robot Hitler.

172
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:21,088
Rym: superd robot hit spur tomato is so last year, yeah No one's gonna get that.

173
00:12:21,892 --> 00:12:28,610
Rym: No, anyway, so, uh, I just find it interesting and I say I'm generally very proud of Google.

174
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,015
Rym: I generally respect what they do.

175
00:12:30,637 --> 00:12:34,009
Rym: I generally still trust them despite the fact that they have a lot of power over me.

176
00:12:34,049 --> 00:12:38,130
Rym: now I mean look we use Google for our front row crew email.

177
00:12:38,753 --> 00:12:41,669
Rym: I use it for all of my searching and I mean all of it.

178
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:47,430
Rym: in fact If I want to search a site like the only searches I do that are not Google are hired Bay.

179
00:12:47,672 --> 00:12:57,941
Rym: Well, no searches on individual sites No Even then if I want to search an individual site a lot of times particularly with the Gentoo forums I use the Google site search instead of using.

180
00:12:57,981 --> 00:12:58,724
Rym: well, it depends.

181
00:12:58,824 --> 00:13:00,230
Scott: it depends on the site, you know.

182
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:07,121
Scott: Yeah, like if I'm on a site already I'll just try their little search box and then if I have problems I'll do the Google thing and I use the Google thing to search.

183
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,270
Scott: fucking dig cuz goddamn the dig search is useless.

184
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,155
Scott: God, there's actually a dig story today.

185
00:13:11,196 --> 00:13:12,620
Scott: That was like dig search.

186
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,906
Scott: useless dig this so he can complain about it.

187
00:13:14,926 --> 00:13:17,861
Rym: I Don't think I've ever successfully found anything.

188
00:13:17,882 --> 00:13:22,265
Scott: I was looking for with the dig search I have but I generally have to go like many many pages in.

189
00:13:22,285 --> 00:13:34,736
Rym: it sucks Yeah, but I also realized that Google has the power They have is not terribly dangerous to people like me and I think I've said this before but I you know I realized what.

190
00:13:34,756 --> 00:13:36,769
Rym: does Google have a lot of information about me?

191
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:40,836
Rym: what's the worst thing Google could do to me as a person?

192
00:13:40,957 --> 00:13:43,972
Rym: if they decided to be a hundred percent evil is Tell the truth.

193
00:13:44,293 --> 00:13:50,069
Rym: the worst they could do is post to the world a list of the things Rym is searched for and the text of all rims emails.

194
00:13:51,851 --> 00:13:58,270
Rym: And while I like to protect those things as best I can I don't think that would particularly cause me any harm personally.

195
00:13:58,693 --> 00:14:01,270
Rym: I'm not saying that I don't people shouldn't fight for privacy.

196
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:06,086
Rym: I'm not saying the privacy isn't important, but Google doesn't really have so much hanging over my head.

197
00:14:06,468 --> 00:14:07,150
Scott: No me either.

198
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:10,927
Scott: I mean even if they fucked me all the way they can't take my money cuz.

199
00:14:11,188 --> 00:14:17,330
Rym: well Well see what Google could do because they can probably figure out your credit card numbers.

200
00:14:17,531 --> 00:14:18,657
Scott: I'll just get my money back.

201
00:14:18,698 --> 00:14:19,321
Scott: is this fraud?

202
00:14:19,623 --> 00:14:32,160
Rym: and if anyone used the same passwords or usernames or whatever for the Gmail that they also used for say all their credit cards and bank accounts and online banking and Google could easily figure out what your bank was and all that.

203
00:14:32,641 --> 00:14:37,290
Rym: if they were really evil they could just empty the bank accounts of Most of the people who use Google and then disappear.

204
00:14:37,784 --> 00:14:44,589
Scott: Yeah even if they did that though Uh, it wouldn't hurt me because I would just go to my bank and say hey Google fucked me and then they'd fix it.

205
00:14:45,091 --> 00:14:45,893
Scott: Maybe they do

206
00:14:46,335 --> 00:15:06,949
Rym: but even then I just a lot of people complain like oh Google has is gonna be the 1984 evil But I'm still seeing no signs of that and this just proves once again that Google While they're not really gonna take much of a loss by denying their business to the great and powerful economy of Germany Especially considering that the services they're denying are free anyway

207
00:15:08,952 --> 00:15:10,236
Scott: They make money off the ads

208
00:15:10,516 --> 00:15:14,689
Rym: yeah, but how much do they make off of Germany as opposed to I don't know anywhere else

209
00:15:15,412 --> 00:15:15,995
Scott: Probably less,

210
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:31,009
Rym: but they're standing up for privacy here now granted They might have an ulterior motive of it would cost us money time and effort to save this data And we're gonna do this thing against Germany under the aura of fighting for privacy, but you know what?

211
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:36,126
Rym: While the end doesn't justify the means if someone does something good for a bad reason.

212
00:15:36,246 --> 00:15:37,270
Rym: I think the good was still done.

213
00:15:37,632 --> 00:15:38,297
Scott: Yeah, me too.

214
00:15:38,982 --> 00:15:43,358
Scott: Oh and one last thing Yeah, the the iPhone comes out on Fridays.

215
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:44,020
Scott: Oh god.

216
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:48,370
Scott: Just don't buy one, but beware don't go near any Apple stores or anything.

217
00:15:48,492 --> 00:15:48,979
Rym: It's coming.

218
00:15:49,345 --> 00:15:49,650
Rym: It's come.

219
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:57,130
Scott: You should buy one if you just have like money on your pocket on fire, and you you you just you're rich yourself.

220
00:16:03,764 --> 00:16:04,246
Rym: It's coming.

221
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:05,050
Rym: It's coming.

222
00:16:05,271 --> 00:16:05,773
Rym: It's coming.

223
00:16:06,054 --> 00:16:07,179
Rym: things of the day.

224
00:16:07,942 --> 00:16:13,640
Rym: So there's a lot of interviews with Richard Dawkins all over YouTube and dig and they pop up.

225
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,904
Rym: It seems like every couple weeks.

226
00:16:15,426 --> 00:16:17,091
Rym: There's a super dug-up story.

227
00:16:17,392 --> 00:16:17,874
Rym: check it out.

228
00:16:17,974 --> 00:16:25,659
Scott: Richard Dawkins was interviewed by so-and-so But the man wrote a book recently and he's got the PR machine and he keeps cranking the PR machine.

229
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:37,620
Scott: thus he's interviewed pretty much by like thousands of radio stations and Thousands of TV stations all around the world and in all sorts of newspapers and magazines, and that's what he does now.

230
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:46,420
Rym: I find the phenomenon interesting that people are Digging these stories up despite the fact that by and large if you watch any interview with Richard Dawkins.

231
00:16:47,104 --> 00:16:49,900
Rym: He says the exact same thing because he wrote his book.

232
00:16:50,262 --> 00:16:53,340
Rym: That's what he had to say and he just says that over and over again.

233
00:16:53,501 --> 00:17:01,380
Rym: I mean imagine if you no one has brought up a Credible argument against him and he generally just knocks people down when they try to get him.

234
00:17:01,882 --> 00:17:05,459
Scott: I mean imagine if you wrote a book and you have to interview with radio stations about it.

235
00:17:05,861 --> 00:17:12,733
Scott: She's basically what the happens is on some day, you know in the morning They put you in a room with a phone and it rings.

236
00:17:12,772 --> 00:17:14,520
Scott: you pick it up and there's some radio guy.

237
00:17:14,661 --> 00:17:16,760
Scott: You don't know and he asked you a few questions.

238
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:21,035
Rym: Yes, the same questions that everyone has been asking you for the last year.

239
00:17:21,055 --> 00:17:22,280
Scott: Yeah, you pick it up again.

240
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,295
Scott: You is another radio guy you hang up you pick it up again.

241
00:17:25,315 --> 00:17:27,349
Scott: There's another radio guy They all ask you the same question.

242
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:28,419
Scott: You give them all the same answers.

243
00:17:28,962 --> 00:17:33,560
Scott: So you just get into a groove of interviewing and every interview is the same thing.

244
00:17:34,203 --> 00:17:42,380
Rym: Yeah, though if anything the way I see it The reason people dig these things up is that dig is more and more becoming a hotbed of activist atheism.

245
00:17:42,721 --> 00:17:49,548
Rym: Yeah, that's how it goes and I find it funny that a lot of people on dig complain about it like oh Why are these things getting dug up?

246
00:17:49,608 --> 00:17:53,826
Rym: This isn't blah blah blah, but that dig is the Regardless of how wise it is.

247
00:17:53,886 --> 00:17:58,623
Rym: the wisdom of the masses and the wisdom of the masses on the internet is generally very pro Atheism these days.

248
00:17:59,285 --> 00:18:01,312
Rym: but it seems like when people dig these stories up.

249
00:18:01,894 --> 00:18:11,920
Rym: I don't think they even watch the interviews I think they just see there was a new one and decide that all right I'm gonna dig this up because I like Richard Dawkins and it's not just with Dawkins with a lot of things.

250
00:18:12,001 --> 00:18:15,491
Rym: I see a lot of Stories that they're not a story.

251
00:18:15,531 --> 00:18:16,275
Rym: There's nothing new.

252
00:18:16,335 --> 00:18:17,300
Rym: There's nothing interesting.

253
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:23,100
Rym: It's just some garbage blog article somewhere with a headline that says something that a bunch of people on dig agree with.

254
00:18:23,462 --> 00:18:27,200
Rym: So they all dig it because they agree with the headline and then they argue about it in the comments.

255
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,950
Rym: But other than that, it's not useful.

256
00:18:30,071 --> 00:18:32,540
Rym: It's just a vote of confidence in this idea.

257
00:18:33,164 --> 00:18:35,520
Scott: And I noticed that's happening with Michael Moore's new movie.

258
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:39,296
Scott: It's like there was one news the movie is on the Internet's before it's in the theater.

259
00:18:39,337 --> 00:18:40,040
Scott: That was the news.

260
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:44,854
Scott: I've seen that like two more dig stories about it that didn't have any news to offer.

261
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:48,749
Scott: It was basically just people Dugging it up like yeah, I like it.

262
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:49,573
Scott: No burying it.

263
00:18:49,634 --> 00:18:50,398
Scott: No, I don't like it.

264
00:18:51,141 --> 00:18:51,923
Scott: What the hell.

265
00:18:52,184 --> 00:18:54,913
Scott: if it's not news, it should just be eliminated by.

266
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:56,056
Scott: you know Fiat.

267
00:18:56,297 --> 00:18:57,180
Scott: It's not news gone.

268
00:18:57,381 --> 00:18:57,864
Rym: See the reason.

269
00:18:57,884 --> 00:19:00,320
Rym: that's it unless dig decides to change the way it works.

270
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:04,755
Rym: Currently a lot of people view dig as nothing more than all right.

271
00:19:05,097 --> 00:19:15,599
Rym: I believe in X. I am going to dig up anything that also agrees with the things I believe in in order to spread these ideas and it's A bunch of competing ideas and it's less and less news.

272
00:19:16,242 --> 00:19:25,919
Scott: People always complain about dig and it's you know, how it's not perfectly democratic And I think it dig is too democratic and it shows you why such a super democratic system doesn't work.

273
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,042
Scott: That's where I think.

274
00:19:27,263 --> 00:19:32,460
Scott: slash dot, you know is the counterexample where it's super editorial, but I think it's that's too editorial.

275
00:19:32,521 --> 00:19:39,183
Rym: You know, I gotta say Whenever I actually want tech news, I still go to slash dot because generally it hits slash dot I don't know.

276
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:44,011
Rym: ten minutes after dig so I don't get the OMG, check out what's happening right now.

277
00:19:44,353 --> 00:19:55,069
Rym: I'm a little bit delayed here, but Usually they at least wait until there's some slight amount of verification and while there are occasional dupes on slash dot They're not dupes of nothing.

278
00:19:55,471 --> 00:19:56,837
Rym: They're at least a dupe of something.

279
00:19:57,218 --> 00:19:59,586
Scott: Yep But yeah, what's the thing of it?

280
00:19:59,767 --> 00:20:02,880
Rym: well my thing of the day is this interview with Richard Dawkins.

281
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:04,489
Scott: It's the same as all the other ones.

282
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:05,857
Rym: Well, here's the thing.

283
00:20:05,937 --> 00:20:06,360
Rym: I want one.

284
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,048
Rym: I wanted to get all that off my chest.

285
00:20:08,088 --> 00:20:12,306
Rym: So I decide alright, this will be the last one kind of like Jack Thompson I don't talk about him anymore.

286
00:20:12,748 --> 00:20:14,856
Rym: I don't need to talk about Richard Dawkins anymore other than that.

287
00:20:14,876 --> 00:20:26,106
Rym: I Can't find any fault with any argument he made But I like this interview and I think I'll make it the thing of the day as the last time I'll bother talking about him Because it comes out with a new book.

288
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:27,932
Scott: Yeah, but you probably be about biology.

289
00:20:28,132 --> 00:20:30,399
Rym: the interviewer goes after him.

290
00:20:31,185 --> 00:20:32,720
Rym: Well one you could see where he's going.

291
00:20:32,781 --> 00:20:41,620
Rym: the interviewer is trying to trap him into Saying something that'll be a soundbite or that look bad in the media or in some way make his interview stand out.

292
00:20:42,001 --> 00:20:48,222
Rym: So he goes on this really different tack and he faints to try to draw Richard Dawkins into this kind of trap he set.

293
00:20:48,302 --> 00:21:05,517
Rym: but the trap was really poorly set and Richard Dawkins is pretty smart and You can tell the guy loses when he does that really quick nodding near the end Little hint rims hint in arguing number 487. any time anyone does that they have already lost the argument and they're angry at you.

294
00:21:05,537 --> 00:21:09,346
Scott: Yep Guy wasn't probably going.

295
00:21:09,386 --> 00:21:13,400
Scott: girl is because he was interviewing someone on TV and you can't go girl.

296
00:21:13,722 --> 00:21:15,715
Scott: He has to keep the face unless you're Bill O'Reilly.

297
00:21:16,158 --> 00:21:20,117
Scott: Oh, yeah They just cut people off when you're losing and say shut up pinhead.

298
00:21:20,419 --> 00:21:24,354
Scott: Yeah All right, so we often tell stories about this.

299
00:21:24,515 --> 00:21:27,425
Scott: one convention we went to Called penguin con.

300
00:21:27,465 --> 00:21:27,987
Scott: thank you.

301
00:21:28,027 --> 00:21:34,247
Rym: con 2.0 penguin con 2.0 the best technology or Linux convention I've ever been to the only one you've ever been to.

302
00:21:34,448 --> 00:21:35,672
Scott: it's also awesome.

303
00:21:35,812 --> 00:21:47,415
Rym: from what I gather based on all the other events like That that was probably the best Linux convention period because I think the other ones tend to be more tech Conference like and not so not so much convention II yeah, not so much.

304
00:21:47,616 --> 00:21:54,640
Scott: hang out with Neil Gaiman I and the gaming and the Linux all wrapped up into one for the triple hurt, right?

305
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,392
Scott: But one interesting thing that happened there is Steve Jackson brought.

306
00:21:58,412 --> 00:22:16,660
Scott: I don't know if you ever played with marble works It was this toy I had when I was a kid and I actually had two sets of it where you would take these plastic pieces and each piece had an entrance and an exit or multiple entrances multiple exits and There was a starting piece and an ending piece and there are also support pieces and you would basically attach all these pieces.

307
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:32,940
Scott: you know beginning to end beginning to end in such a way that you put marbles in the top and they would go down and Do various things like you get there's even a jump you get the marbles to like jump across the room or spin a spinny Thing or go back and forth or go in a spiral

308
00:22:33,341 --> 00:22:38,962
Rym: Like there was the little trampolines you could put mounted somewhere at an angle and just launch marbles at it and up into something else.

309
00:22:39,143 --> 00:22:47,214
Scott: yep, there was all sorts of stuff like that and Basically he brought the more newer more advanced version of marble works.

310
00:22:47,374 --> 00:22:47,856
Rym: furthermore.

311
00:22:47,896 --> 00:22:49,260
Rym: He brought a lot of it.

312
00:22:49,421 --> 00:22:50,105
Scott: Yes, that is not.

313
00:22:50,347 --> 00:22:52,300
Scott: I don't think it's business related to marble works.

314
00:22:52,340 --> 00:23:05,545
Scott: I think it's a different company and a different product all together But it's generally the same idea that you put marbles in it They go and they do all this crazy stuff then they get to the bottom and there's actually an electronic Elevator that brings them back up I forget the name of the toy but it doesn't matter.

315
00:23:05,565 --> 00:23:08,759
Scott: and then the marbles go to the top and they do it again and it was pretty cool.

316
00:23:08,779 --> 00:23:19,400
Scott: and One night I think we caught we were bored and we decided we got a crazy idea and that hey would it be possible to make a Binary adder out of this machine?

317
00:23:19,902 --> 00:23:30,907
Rym: So we went over and the thing is he said he's basically just dumped all this stuff in the room and said Do what thou wilt and he was gonna come back at the end of the con and see what had been made of his thing pretty much 24/7.

318
00:23:30,907 --> 00:23:40,611
Rym: so we sat around myself and Scott our friend James and I think Alex and We took all these bits and we saw all the ones that weren't being used currently and we started trying to figure out how to make an adder with what we had.

319
00:23:41,315 --> 00:23:44,495
Scott: and I think the You know, we had some really good ideas.

320
00:23:44,515 --> 00:23:56,468
Scott: We were working on it But I think the conclusion we came to is that in order to make an adder We would need a new piece that wasn't in the set that would allow us to hold a marble Temporarily and then release it, you know based on something else

321
00:23:56,769 --> 00:24:00,900
Rym: and there was no piece in the entire thing short of heavily modifying them.

322
00:24:00,941 --> 00:24:01,550
Rym: That would do that.

323
00:24:01,977 --> 00:24:09,067
Scott: Yep So he pretty much you know gave up even after much thinking and we pretty much Pushed it to the limit and then we were done.

324
00:24:09,509 --> 00:24:16,076
Scott: Well this guy here in this website it's actually make magazine out of wood and marbles.

325
00:24:16,297 --> 00:24:25,376
Scott: he has made a Binary adding machine and this is pretty good to watch because number one it reminds me of PangoCon Yeah, and it shows you what you're trying to accomplish.

326
00:24:25,456 --> 00:24:33,270
Scott: Yeah Do if you don't know about binary math This will help you understand how computers do math.

327
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:36,940
Scott: This is how the computer you were using adds numbers together.

328
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:41,435
Scott: It does the same thing only instead of pieces of wood bouncing back and forth.

329
00:24:41,876 --> 00:24:44,666
Scott: It has transistors that Electricity back and forth.

330
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:46,594
Scott: This is exactly how it works.

331
00:24:47,015 --> 00:24:48,160
Scott: This is how your computer does it.

332
00:24:48,501 --> 00:24:52,300
Scott: You can see it now on a big scale how your computer does maths.

333
00:24:52,481 --> 00:24:56,096
Rym: Yeah, if you wanted you could do calculations with this thing straight up.

334
00:24:56,116 --> 00:24:59,040
Rym: You could make a bigger one You could make a nested one all sorts of fun things.

335
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:03,665
Scott: Yes, if you have a little pocket calculator it is doing this Exactly doing this.

336
00:25:04,207 --> 00:25:08,280
Scott: the same thing that's going on here with transistors instead of wood and marbles.

337
00:25:08,922 --> 00:25:13,679
Scott: So if you don't understand binary math, this is a good video to watch.

338
00:25:14,503 --> 00:25:24,880
Rym: Actually when I was in middle school in science Olympiad in seventh grade I made a machine almost exactly like that with the help of an engineer to much other people that were working on this project with Us.

339
00:25:24,921 --> 00:25:30,440
Rym: but we basically made one just exactly the same with the same mechanism of the rocker and the marbles.

340
00:25:30,823 --> 00:25:32,379
Rym: We use pachinko balls that we happen to have.

341
00:25:33,062 --> 00:25:52,200
Rym: But what we did is we set it up with a pendulum clock and every time the pendulum swung every second It would release a marble from the pachinko machine at the top and send it into the adder and as a result We could keep track of time By saving the states in the adder and make events happen at specific times based on the order of the bits.

342
00:25:52,882 --> 00:25:53,122
Scott: Uh-huh.

343
00:25:53,463 --> 00:25:58,178
Scott: This guy just has sort of like the input then the processing and then he pushes something in.

344
00:25:58,218 --> 00:25:58,860
Scott: the output falls.

345
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:01,328
Rym: Yeah, it's just it's really cool and check it out.

346
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:01,970
Rym: Yep.

347
00:26:02,412 --> 00:26:04,137
Rym: So we haven't done this in a while.

348
00:26:04,177 --> 00:26:04,960
Rym: It's time to do it again.

349
00:26:05,001 --> 00:26:10,574
Rym: I think the Explain how computers work and somewhat layman semi non-technical terrorists is round.

350
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:12,239
Scott: I think we're beyond how computers work.

351
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:16,192
Scott: now We're into like general how technology internet type things work.

352
00:26:16,353 --> 00:26:18,540
Rym: No, it's still part of the how computers work series.

353
00:26:18,661 --> 00:26:23,020
Scott: I guess yeah, of course, but you know, we're we're beyond the physical PC now.

354
00:26:23,394 --> 00:26:40,031
Rym: Yep though I would say that if you don't know a lot about computers and you haven't already listened to our shows on IP You know layer 2 layer 3 how networks work on basic level and if you didn't listen to our shows about ports and how ports Work, you might have a little trouble with what we're about to talk about.

355
00:26:40,111 --> 00:26:40,714
Rym: I think we did.

356
00:26:40,734 --> 00:26:43,243
Rym: Hey, it doesn't matter I'm pretty sure we did.

357
00:26:43,544 --> 00:26:43,705
Rym: Yep.

358
00:26:44,126 --> 00:26:46,915
Scott: But basically we're gonna talk about some firewalls.

359
00:26:46,936 --> 00:26:48,280
Scott: You've probably heard of a firewall.

360
00:26:48,602 --> 00:26:58,166
Scott: You might even use a firewall or think you're using a firewall and you hear a lot of you will talk about breaking through firewalls or firewalls getting in the way or All sorts of stuff.

361
00:26:58,246 --> 00:27:06,780
Scott: and well a lot of people don't really know What a firewall does and how it works and how to use it and what it does and what it doesn't do.

362
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,889
Rym: Yes, a firewall is not the magical barrier.

363
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,956
Rym: You have to break through in order to hack the Gibson.

364
00:27:12,638 --> 00:27:18,060
Rym: That is true Basically in a very simple term a firewall.

365
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:20,765
Rym: well first of all think about why it's named a firewall.

366
00:27:20,846 --> 00:27:37,540
Rym: in the real world a firewall is a structure in a building that Separates multiple compartments of the building from each other in such a way that if a fire starts in one area It is difficult if not impossible for the fire to spread beyond the firewall to the other area.

367
00:27:37,976 --> 00:27:44,460
Rym: Yeah You know some buildings like they have the fire doors and you have to leave them closed Because if you leave them closed and there's a fire the fire can't get past that door.

368
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:52,120
Scott: Yeah, like in a lot of modern buildings when you have like the big double doors just in the middle of a hallway And you say why are there double doors in the middle of the hallway?

369
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:55,400
Scott: But you don't notice really because they're held open by these magnets on the wall.

370
00:27:55,881 --> 00:28:02,824
Scott: But if you pull the fire alarm or the fire alarm goes off all the magnets holding the doors open turn off and all the doors Close.

371
00:28:03,146 --> 00:28:09,379
Scott: and now if there's a fire in that hallway It's not gonna get beyond those double doors because they're magic doors that block fire.

372
00:28:09,901 --> 00:28:17,366
Rym: Now firewalls in terms of computers are a little bit more elegant than that in that they're not a break they're not a solid barrier.

373
00:28:17,808 --> 00:28:27,340
Rym: instead very simply all they do is Filter the IP traffic or whatever traffic on the internet or network that's coming into your computer.

374
00:28:27,821 --> 00:28:37,719
Rym: they filter it based on a set of rules and they don't let things in that you didn't explicitly tell them to let in and They don't let things out that you didn't explicitly tell them to let out.

375
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:44,746
Scott: Yep And by default if you just take a computer and you connect it to the internet and you get an IP you have an IP Address you you own one.

376
00:28:44,766 --> 00:28:45,549
Scott: Let's say right.

377
00:28:45,569 --> 00:28:47,136
Scott: Yep, and you're on the internet.

378
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:54,300
Scott: any Traffic on the internet that's going around if it's meant for you your computer will take it in.

379
00:28:54,781 --> 00:28:59,320
Scott: You know, your actual computer will take that traffic in and consider it and do whatever it needs to do with it.

380
00:28:59,462 --> 00:29:01,464
Scott: It might not do anything with it But it'll.

381
00:29:01,524 --> 00:29:02,830
Scott: it'll take it in and do something.

382
00:29:03,352 --> 00:29:05,723
Scott: and if the traffic is not meant for your computer Well, you can.

383
00:29:05,864 --> 00:29:07,233
Scott: your network card ignores it.

384
00:29:07,253 --> 00:29:13,335
Scott: So you're never gonna see that and Anything your computer wants to send out of itself to elsewhere on the internet will go.

385
00:29:13,535 --> 00:29:19,264
Scott: it'll go out to the router and go Wherever it needs to go and then whatever they do on wherever that destination is They'll do.

386
00:29:19,749 --> 00:29:28,060
Rym: now in a perfect world This is fine because your computer has ports and ports are basically where the applications sit and listen for someone to connect to them.

387
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:42,177
Rym: So if I'm running a VNC so I can get into my computer from somewhere else The VNC port on my computer is open and listening and whenever someone connects to it It says basically I'll connect and say hey port VNC.

388
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:43,040
Rym: Are you there?

389
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,898
Rym: And my computer says why yes I am and I say I am so-and-so and I would like to VNC.

390
00:29:47,918 --> 00:29:50,025
Rym: and the computer says I object you are okay.

391
00:29:50,286 --> 00:29:50,988
Rym: I'm letting you in.

392
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:51,931
Rym: that's great.

393
00:29:52,573 --> 00:29:54,720
Rym: But uh, what if Scott?

394
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:59,237
Rym: Decides that he wants to VNC into my computer and I don't want him to?

395
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:01,527
Rym: well He knows that my computers online.

396
00:30:01,547 --> 00:30:05,988
Rym: so he connects to my computer and the computer says hi I'm port VNC.

397
00:30:06,411 --> 00:30:07,418
Rym: and Scott says I know.

398
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:20,255
Scott: and Now while theoretically in a perfect world the VNC won't let him in because he can't authenticate properly I don't know the VNC password, you know, so I get this login screen to log into VNC But I don't know what the password is.

399
00:30:20,781 --> 00:30:21,664
Rym: But in a perfect world.

400
00:30:21,824 --> 00:30:26,320
Rym: the software on the computer itself is secure and just doesn't let Scott in anyway.

401
00:30:26,621 --> 00:30:31,477
Rym: So now Scott has learned that my computer is running VNC because it responded and said hi.

402
00:30:31,517 --> 00:30:34,990
Rym: I'm running VNC But beyond that there's nothing he can do.

403
00:30:35,532 --> 00:30:37,640
Scott: However, the world is not perfect.

404
00:30:37,841 --> 00:30:54,020
Scott: In fact VNC many versions of VNC like older versions especially have many flaws and I'm sure new flaws will be discovered is far from a perfect service and pretty much anything you run on Your computer even SSH, which is probably the most secure thing in the world is not a hundred percent perfect.

405
00:30:54,181 --> 00:30:58,237
Rym: Furthermore a lot of times your computer has ports open and you don't even know it.

406
00:30:58,478 --> 00:31:07,333
Scott: Yep, and Someone who knows what the business is Even if you have VNC and even if you have a password Someone can still connect to that and do something.

407
00:31:07,393 --> 00:31:08,740
Scott: they can get the VNC going on.

408
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:09,906
Scott: Maybe they had.

409
00:31:09,926 --> 00:31:12,480
Scott: they can type something in as a username and password.

410
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:18,599
Scott: That's all garbled that your will confuse VNC that because it has a bug in it and will override it and let them log in.

411
00:31:19,241 --> 00:31:31,073
Scott: Maybe they can you know Manually craft some network packets and send those packets to the VNC port thus confusing the DNA Yeah, the VNC service and giving them access.

412
00:31:31,193 --> 00:31:38,699
Scott: There's all sorts of things they can do Be able to try those things even in a perfect world by having your computer exposed like that.

413
00:31:39,202 --> 00:31:44,350
Rym: People can learn more about your computer than you might expect Because you can do something called port scanning.

414
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:47,700
Rym: where my computer isn't behind a firewall It's just connected to the internet.

415
00:31:47,841 --> 00:31:48,483
Rym: Anyone can see it.

416
00:31:49,026 --> 00:31:58,266
Rym: someone could just start on port one and go all the way up to the top knocking on every single port saying hello anybody there and Recording whatever response they get.

417
00:31:58,728 --> 00:32:01,899
Rym: and certain operating systems respond to certain things in different ways.

418
00:32:01,959 --> 00:32:10,680
Rym: certain applications respond to things in different ways and You can learn a lot of information about a computer just by looking at what ports are open.

419
00:32:11,121 --> 00:32:14,494
Scott: Yeah, like oh look this computer has these ports open.

420
00:32:14,755 --> 00:32:16,080
Scott: Oh, and this is right.

421
00:32:16,543 --> 00:32:18,132
Scott: This is the response I get from that port.

422
00:32:18,172 --> 00:32:19,319
Scott: So I know what service that is.

423
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:22,239
Scott: Hey Did you know that like a default?

424
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:28,878
Scott: Installation of Red Hat 6 has the exact same ports open and the exact same services running on those ports.

425
00:32:28,918 --> 00:32:29,600
Scott: is this computer?

426
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,167
Scott: Obviously, it's a Red Hat 6 machine.

427
00:32:32,207 --> 00:32:34,696
Scott: Well, let's go look up a Red Hat 6 exploit.

428
00:32:34,836 --> 00:32:36,462
Scott: Oh, look I owned you Yep.

429
00:32:36,944 --> 00:32:39,233
Rym: Now you might think because this is a common fallacy.

430
00:32:39,294 --> 00:32:47,190
Rym: if we ever do more shows on computer security We'll talk about this a lot But a lot of people think alright But what hacker out there is gonna go after me?

431
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:51,703
Rym: and the real answer is no no hacker is going to target you unless you're A bank or something.

432
00:32:51,723 --> 00:32:54,653
Rym: Yeah, but if you're just a home user, it's not like Rym.

433
00:32:54,673 --> 00:33:00,078
Rym: the hacker when he was in middle school or high school Thought I'm gonna go get Scott Rubin.

434
00:33:00,118 --> 00:33:05,080
Rym: this guy I've never met because I just happen to know his IP address and he's a fun.

435
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:22,436
Scott: I mean theoretically if you're at Def Con or something then yes, so Or if you have a friend or you know an enemy who's someone you know in real life Maybe like a kid at school is like actually elite hacker like a really elite hacker and he wants to get you Then maybe you could get got.

436
00:33:22,578 --> 00:33:24,680
Rym: yeah But the odds were you know, you might think all right.

437
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:31,655
Rym: Or if you go on IRC in some dangerous chat room and say something stupid But in general no one's gonna go after you and that's true.

438
00:33:31,836 --> 00:33:34,164
Rym: The problem is Computers are fast.

439
00:33:34,726 --> 00:33:38,960
Rym: It is not very difficult to scan one computer all the way through on the ports.

440
00:33:39,743 --> 00:33:44,700
Rym: It's not that difficult to scan every computer on the internet for all its ports.

441
00:33:44,881 --> 00:33:56,200
Scott: It's also not very difficult to say if you get one computer Then you turn it into a zombie that you can get that computer to scan a bunch of computers or just send out attacks.

442
00:33:56,782 --> 00:34:01,860
Scott: you know, you can just start attacking without even checking to see if that attack will work on all the computers nearby.

443
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:09,895
Scott: and You know if you just shoot a machine gun left and right just gonna make a gun analogy You're gonna hit somebody the way.

444
00:34:10,116 --> 00:34:10,639
Rym: think of it this way.

445
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,940
Scott: You got a lot of machine guns and a lot of zombies.

446
00:34:13,241 --> 00:34:19,326
Scott: You're gonna end up hitting a lot more people turning them into zombies too in the modern modern America or Finland Or whatever.

447
00:34:19,346 --> 00:34:20,280
Rym: you're walking down the street.

448
00:34:20,701 --> 00:34:26,760
Rym: You might think well everyone says I should wear a Kevlar vest because those stop bullets, but no one's gonna shoot me.

449
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,326
Rym: I'm just some guy and that's true.

450
00:34:28,386 --> 00:34:31,800
Rym: No one wants to shoot you, but the internet is not modern Finland.

451
00:34:32,061 --> 00:34:32,984
Scott: It is the Wild West.

452
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:40,375
Rym: internet is the Wild West and there are bullets and Indians and cowboys and hatchets Everywhere flying randomly in every direction.

453
00:34:40,435 --> 00:34:41,340
Rym: It's not even the Wild West.

454
00:34:41,721 --> 00:34:48,942
Rym: It's the Wild West if every street had a Maxim machine gun pointed in every direction firing 24/7.

455
00:34:48,942 --> 00:34:53,114
Scott: So you kind of want to put some armor on so you don't get chewed up.

456
00:34:53,436 --> 00:34:54,580
Rym: Yeah, and there's a lot of reasons.

457
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:55,783
Rym: It's not just security.

458
00:34:56,143 --> 00:35:01,720
Rym: firewalls also serve the purpose of keeping traffic out of your network to prevent it from slowing it down.

459
00:35:02,121 --> 00:35:11,029
Rym: I mean our network here gets hit in terms like someone will try to connect to the IP address We have on the outside via SSH Probably once a second 24/7.

460
00:35:11,029 --> 00:35:18,220
Rym: Mmm And if we let that into our router our router is gonna have to deny or deal with all those connections.

461
00:35:19,185 --> 00:35:23,192
Rym: If I let it into our network It's gonna go to our computers and mess with all of our.

462
00:35:23,252 --> 00:35:28,319
Rym: even if it doesn't break in even if no one hacks us It's still using our network capacity and causing trouble for us.

463
00:35:28,774 --> 00:35:29,281
Scott: Yeah we have to.

464
00:35:29,361 --> 00:35:36,041
Scott: all these packets get through into the network and they eventually get to a computer and then that computer has to deal with It.

465
00:35:36,422 --> 00:35:44,519
Scott: if we can somehow keep these packets outside of the network, you know Cuz there's only one hole one pipe that goes out onto the real interview.

466
00:35:45,061 --> 00:35:47,671
Scott: Yeah, one tube that goes from our network to the internet.

467
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:52,819
Scott: if we can somehow keep all the packets We don't care about on the other end of that tube.

468
00:35:53,302 --> 00:36:02,766
Scott: Then our computers don't have to worry about them and our computers can only worry about the things I have to worry about and some other machine on the other end of the tube Can sort of keep all the bad bits out.

469
00:36:03,288 --> 00:36:09,999
Rym: now there are hardware and software firewalls and we're really talking about hardware firewalls But we'll talk about the difference at the end of all this.

470
00:36:10,824 --> 00:36:14,100
Rym: The way the firewall works on a fundamental level is extremely simple.

471
00:36:14,602 --> 00:36:19,600
Rym: The complexity is all in knowing what commands and numbers to put in and what rules to set.

472
00:36:19,981 --> 00:36:24,659
Rym: But basically a firewall is a very simple computer and it looks at the traffic coming in.

473
00:36:25,361 --> 00:36:30,817
Rym: It applies rules that you wrote to that traffic and then forwards it as you have specified.

474
00:36:31,098 --> 00:36:34,828
Scott: for example I have a firewall right the one end.

475
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:38,758
Scott: one side is the internet on the other side is the network of computers.

476
00:36:38,799 --> 00:36:41,787
Scott: in this house I make one rule and one rule only.

477
00:36:41,828 --> 00:36:46,101
Scott: that rule could be don't allow any traffic on port 8,000.

478
00:36:46,101 --> 00:36:49,099
Scott: Okay, all this traffic is coming in from the internet, right?

479
00:36:50,102 --> 00:36:53,416
Scott: If it's for port 7999 it comes right through.

480
00:36:53,597 --> 00:36:55,906
Scott: if it's on port 8001 it comes right through.

481
00:36:56,046 --> 00:37:00,140
Scott: everything would be just the same as if I connected my computer directly to the internet.

482
00:37:00,481 --> 00:37:07,580
Scott: But now anything that wants to go on port 8,000 it doesn't get through the firewall Just doesn't do anything about those packets.

483
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:13,080
Scott: It drops them off and ignores them and they don't go through to the other side and my computers don't even know they exist.

484
00:37:13,482 --> 00:37:25,707
Rym: Yep, so on a fundamental straight-up dumb firewall all you do is tell it either what ports do I want to allow in which directions or What ports do I not want to allow?

485
00:37:25,968 --> 00:37:30,083
Rym: you see there are two defaults and it's pretty logically obvious Why this is the case.

486
00:37:30,625 --> 00:37:45,820
Rym: you can either have a firewall that by default blocks everything and then open up the things you want to Open up or you can have a firewall that by default lets anything through and then you specifically block The things you don't want in and both I have their uses and are equally valid.

487
00:37:46,161 --> 00:37:56,800
Rym: But in general the former is what people use for security because the vast majority of the ports out there You're not serving anything worthwhile on them and you don't want anyone sniffing around

488
00:37:57,181 --> 00:38:08,928
Scott: Mm-hmm generally the setting that most people use because the default setting the most people use just to make you know the quick secure thing for a non-specific situation is Okay, don't let anything in.

489
00:38:08,968 --> 00:38:11,680
Scott: if someone just tries to come in unsolicited, you know.

490
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,339
Scott: Just someone just comes up and knocks on the door.

491
00:38:13,744 --> 00:38:16,199
Scott: Just ignore them all the time No matter what port they're on.

492
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:22,509
Scott: It doesn't matter if someone on the inside of the network wants to ask for something on the internet Let it go out all the time.

493
00:38:22,911 --> 00:38:24,277
Scott: These are people on our network.

494
00:38:24,317 --> 00:38:24,860
Scott: We trust them.

495
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:27,535
Scott: They can send anything out that we that they want to.

496
00:38:27,857 --> 00:38:30,712
Rym: now you might Go ahead because I think you're gonna jump ahead.

497
00:38:31,034 --> 00:38:31,757
Scott: Oh my good jump ahead.

498
00:38:31,777 --> 00:38:34,391
Rym: I think so I think you're gonna stay the concept that we hadn't brought up yet.

499
00:38:34,873 --> 00:38:35,617
Scott: Oh, it is a concept.

500
00:38:35,637 --> 00:38:36,140
Scott: We have brought up.

501
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,224
Scott: Yes, I was moving on.

502
00:38:37,626 --> 00:38:44,572
Scott: Ah, so now let's say someone on the inside Connects to google.com on port 80.

503
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:45,879
Scott: We're letting that through that's going out.

504
00:38:45,899 --> 00:38:49,051
Rym: Yep It's going out but like Scott said we're not letting anything come in.

505
00:38:49,312 --> 00:38:51,199
Rym: but we can go out but nothing can come in.

506
00:38:51,339 --> 00:38:51,540
Scott: and what?

507
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:57,225
Scott: We do and we go out is all we're sending out is a message that says hey google Send me google.com the web page.

508
00:38:57,506 --> 00:39:00,736
Rym: so google sends it back, but we're not letting anyone in.

509
00:39:01,377 --> 00:39:02,200
Scott: so it doesn't get in.

510
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,965
Scott: And now I can't visit google.com.

511
00:39:03,985 --> 00:39:05,309
Scott: What the hell's the use of that?

512
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:16,099
Rym: Well, the thing is dumb firewalls or Stateless firewalls are like that and you have to specifically set up exactly what you want going in and what you want going out.

513
00:39:16,641 --> 00:39:25,990
Rym: Those are generally used in enterprise situations and corporate situations and very tightly controlled situations where in this case you could use a rule where you can.

514
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:36,196
Rym: you can figure out what port Google would be coming back on and Let all those ports in Automatically by default but not let in the low numbered ports.

515
00:39:36,216 --> 00:39:40,640
Rym: because remember when we did the port show We talked about how there's certain services that run on low ports.

516
00:39:41,001 --> 00:39:47,279
Rym: But the really high numbered ports are random or ephemeral and they're only used for these temporary connections to things like Google Yep.

517
00:39:47,662 --> 00:39:51,357
Rym: but even then that's still a kind of complicated firewall rule and you got to deal with it and you

518
00:39:51,377 --> 00:39:54,661
Scott: never know a Service could be running on a high-numbered port Screwed

519
00:39:54,842 --> 00:40:01,006
Rym: a lot of virus bought whatever things will run their evil services on the high up ports because they know that a lot of Dumb firewalls.

520
00:40:01,228 --> 00:40:02,457
Rym: Well, let's stuff in on those ports.

521
00:40:03,404 --> 00:40:10,837
Rym: Thus the concept Scott was gonna get to is that Intelligent firewalls new firewalls modern firewalls not piece-of-shit firewalls.

522
00:40:10,857 --> 00:40:16,133
Rym: Well, yeah granted though I have oftentimes set up firewalls that were not stateful on purpose.

523
00:40:16,153 --> 00:40:18,260
Scott: Yes, but they are not useful for normal people.

524
00:40:19,181 --> 00:40:23,553
Scott: They're useful for mostly computers that not desktop computers that people are sitting at.

525
00:40:23,593 --> 00:40:28,380
Scott: they're useful for other sorts of computers and you know Strange environments and data centers and all that.

526
00:40:28,701 --> 00:40:35,600
Rym: The big use is in networks like between two large networks where you know exactly what's going to be going around.

527
00:40:35,661 --> 00:40:42,316
Scott: Yep, but the other thing is that Any you know firewall that is the new kind can do everything.

528
00:40:42,336 --> 00:40:51,151
Scott: the old kind can yeah Yeah, so, you know Even if you're using it in the old style the busted style You can still use a new firewall that is capable of doing awesome new things.

529
00:40:51,391 --> 00:40:59,131
Rym: now a stateful firewall as opposed to a stateless firewall Very simply remembers what's going on so you can tell it.

530
00:40:59,451 --> 00:41:09,698
Rym: All right, let anything go out no matter what and Let anything that is associated with a pre-existing outgoing connection come back in.

531
00:41:10,626 --> 00:41:25,516
Scott: So if I connect to google.com That's a pre-existing outgoing connection and when the stuff comes back from google.com for me The firewall knows that that goes along with the stuff that I sent out already and it lets that in but it doesn't let anything Else in.

532
00:41:25,536 --> 00:41:28,309
Scott: yep So it's only lets things in that are solicited.

533
00:41:28,369 --> 00:41:32,784
Scott: if I ask for something to be brought in from the inside It lets it in.

534
00:41:33,226 --> 00:41:35,275
Scott: if it's not asked for it doesn't get it.

535
00:41:35,536 --> 00:41:38,754
Rym: now you might wonder well How does the firewall know what was solicited and not?

536
00:41:38,815 --> 00:41:39,600
Scott: it's really smart.

537
00:41:39,801 --> 00:41:42,359
Rym: Well, actually the answer is there's a couple different ways to do that.

538
00:41:43,182 --> 00:41:48,400
Rym: I think that's a little too technical for the level we want to go for today, but suffice to say it's really smart.

539
00:41:48,701 --> 00:41:51,279
Rym: Well, we'll do a show in the future on smarter than you.

540
00:41:52,884 --> 00:41:54,139
Rym: It's actually still kind of dumb.

541
00:41:54,380 --> 00:42:06,760
Rym: But and there a lot of the ways to do it can be fooled and the ways that are more difficult to fool Are also more difficult to implement and expensive but not really have to buy a thing from Cisco for a lot of money.

542
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:10,986
Rym: Yeah, I mean basically we could go into more technical detail But that's all you need to know.

543
00:42:11,026 --> 00:42:12,131
Rym: That's how a firewall works.

544
00:42:12,151 --> 00:42:12,894
Rym: That's all it does.

545
00:42:12,954 --> 00:42:13,637
Rym: It's very simple.

546
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:18,580
Rym: now That was a hardware firewall a box like a Cisco picks or something.

547
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:24,462
Scott: We're talking about a box with lights on it in two holes and a wire goes in one hole and another wire goes in the Other hole.

548
00:42:24,623 --> 00:42:34,860
Rym: now a lot of costs like hundreds of dollars like to run software firewalls Which basically do the same thing that a hardware firewall does but they run on your computer as?

549
00:42:35,582 --> 00:42:39,195
Rym: A program as a service and they co-opt all your ports.

550
00:42:39,295 --> 00:42:40,680
Rym: Yeah, they block things on their own.

551
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,411
Scott: We're talking about here is zone alarm.

552
00:42:42,492 --> 00:42:45,487
Rym: Cygate Windows Has it built in?

553
00:42:45,608 --> 00:42:47,399
Scott: Yep Vista has it built in?

554
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:50,940
Scott: I think actually Mac OS has something built in sort of like that.

555
00:42:51,282 --> 00:43:02,168
Rym: These are generally fairly effective and they're better than nothing Because you can at least know what ports are open or set it to by default block ports You're probably not going to use.

556
00:43:02,289 --> 00:43:05,789
Scott: yeah, and a lot of them will tell you like hey Someone's trying to connect on this port.

557
00:43:05,889 --> 00:43:07,960
Scott: or hey, you're trying to use this port.

558
00:43:08,061 --> 00:43:10,039
Scott: Are you sure you want to use this port and that way?

559
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:16,739
Scott: Let's say a virus gets on your computer from an email attachment and it tries to send things and zombie bites out on the internet.

560
00:43:17,203 --> 00:43:22,660
Scott: It'll the firewall will tell you Hey, this thing is sending zombie bites out and then it sort of keeps you aware of what your computer's do.

561
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:22,882
Scott: That's

562
00:43:22,922 --> 00:43:47,960
Rym: a really overlooked important part of firewalls And in fact that was one of the primary reasons we said of the firewalls We set up back at IBM not so much to keep things out But to keep things in because we had a lab where we did a lot of our development work and we wanted a firewall To monitor and block things coming out of our network into the real IBM network To make sure that we didn't do anything bad or break anything out there or to see what was going on on our end.

563
00:43:48,541 --> 00:44:03,199
Rym: So if you've got a computer that might be compromised you can usually see that if the firewall suddenly is blocking all these strange Request from your computer to web servers or IRC things that you've never heard of.

564
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:11,896
Rym: The problem with software firewalls is that they run on your computer and thus they can be compromised Just as easily as anything else on your computer.

565
00:44:12,279 --> 00:44:27,956
Scott: Yep I mean if someone has a worm that can take over Windows XP, you know Your fire what your software firewall might block that worm, but it doesn't mean your software firewall doesn't have its own Vulnerability and someone could take over your software firewall and then use the Windows XP worm.

566
00:44:28,557 --> 00:44:31,449
Scott: and that's that It's not network level security.

567
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:35,664
Scott: It's still on the same level of security as Your actual computer.

568
00:44:35,945 --> 00:44:38,093
Scott: your network card still has to deal with all this stuff.

569
00:44:38,333 --> 00:44:40,240
Scott: your processors still has to deal with all this stuff.

570
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:46,220
Scott: It takes up system resources and you're not getting all the advantages of having a real hardware firewall.

571
00:44:46,441 --> 00:45:01,312
Rym: However, we're not saying that you shouldn't use these things because these are still important valuable tools and keeping your computer secure Especially especially and especially if you go around to using open wireless access point Yes, or LAN parties or college campuses.

572
00:45:01,433 --> 00:45:09,014
Scott: Yep, but if you're in your house Right, and we told you before if you're in your house You should have a router even if you only have one computer a NAT router.

573
00:45:09,476 --> 00:45:12,769
Scott: if you have a net router You probably don't need a software firewall.

574
00:45:12,789 --> 00:45:14,737
Rym: You see the net kind of by default.

575
00:45:14,777 --> 00:45:15,660
Rym: We talked about how networks.

576
00:45:15,841 --> 00:45:19,460
Rym: I suggest if you don't know what that is that you listen to a whole episode on this.

577
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,600
Rym: We did that you listen to our show on net network address translation.

578
00:45:23,183 --> 00:45:35,343
Rym: But basically if you have one of those links is whatever routers Running the net you get almost all the benefits of a firewall because by default stuff just can't connect to you from the outside Unsolicited

579
00:45:35,584 --> 00:45:39,420
Scott: and if you connect out and you ask for something, it'll get back in.

580
00:45:39,721 --> 00:45:43,962
Scott: It's like having a you know, the default stateful firewall But it's net.

581
00:45:44,343 --> 00:45:50,219
Rym: so the simple answer for you home users is have a net router and run a software firewall.

582
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:54,060
Rym: and While you might think like oh, but shouldn't have a hardware firewall?

583
00:45:54,661 --> 00:46:01,520
Rym: Hardware firewalls are mostly only used by businesses corporations or people who are really really really care about security.

584
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:08,773
Scott: Yeah, a hardware firewall right that if you bought a hardware firewall Let's say you've got one for free from Cisco, you know, like a pick.

585
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:09,556
Rym: Cisco picks.

586
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:10,640
Rym: They're pretty hot.

587
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:18,315
Scott: Yeah, it's like the default firewall that's like the standard one, you know If you got one of those you'd probably just configure it to do the same thing.

588
00:46:18,335 --> 00:46:19,198
Scott: You're not router does?

589
00:46:19,419 --> 00:46:19,580
Rym: yeah?

590
00:46:19,927 --> 00:46:23,860
Rym: I mean, yeah The only time you don't want to use the net is if you're serving a lot of things.

591
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:30,341
Rym: You've got a really extensive network or you've got like permanent connections and VPN setup and all these things that you're not going to be Doing.

592
00:46:30,522 --> 00:46:33,997
Scott: yeah, plus also for the price of one of those things you could just get a computer.

593
00:46:34,278 --> 00:46:36,488
Scott: Yes You know how many links is this?

594
00:46:36,508 --> 00:46:36,909
Scott: Could you get?

595
00:46:36,929 --> 00:46:37,914
Scott: you get tons of links?

596
00:46:37,934 --> 00:46:39,420
Rym: This is here's where we'll end it.

597
00:46:39,621 --> 00:46:45,780
Rym: If you really want to have a hardware firewall remember in the beginning Are we said that a firewall is basically just a specialized computer?

598
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:53,760
Rym: You could get an old computer and there's actually a bunch of them I think in the forum or the comments or whatever will probably list a few good ones.

599
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,580
Rym: Yeah, there are Linux live CDs and Linux distributions and also just Linux software.

600
00:46:59,841 --> 00:47:08,144
Rym: Yep, where Windows software you can take an old computer that you're not using anymore run the software on it and effectively use that as A hardware firewall.

601
00:47:08,466 --> 00:47:11,800
Rym: Yeah, you basically and a router and a VPN and all those other things.

602
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:12,986
Scott: Yeah, I mean think about it.

603
00:47:13,106 --> 00:47:14,392
Scott: a firewall is just a computer.

604
00:47:14,553 --> 00:47:16,020
Scott: a router is just a computer, right?

605
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:36,447
Scott: If you just take a computer and you put two network cards in it or more network cards one of them is the out network card and one's the in network card and one side of this computer is the internet and the other side of the computer is your network, right and you install some software on the computer to make it firewall and Tada you now have a hardware firewall.

606
00:47:36,628 --> 00:47:38,254
Scott: It's it's a computer instead of just.

607
00:47:38,354 --> 00:47:38,736
Rym: actually.

608
00:47:38,756 --> 00:47:39,900
Rym: this gives me an idea.

609
00:47:39,981 --> 00:47:42,060
Rym: We should do a show not now not anytime real soon.

610
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:43,184
Rym: But what do you guys think?

611
00:47:43,204 --> 00:47:46,516
Rym: what if we did a show where we picked what like one of the good Linux like?

612
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:54,315
Rym: Network service firewall security, whatever solutions and just did a show of all the cool things you can do with it Just in your home.

613
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:59,580
Rym: Yeah Like all the things you could set up with it how to set it up securely how to make the VPN thing is a lot.

614
00:47:59,741 --> 00:48:06,532
Scott: Actually set up a lot of those things is kind of complicated to edit a lot of config files And it's it's not really an easy thing to do.

615
00:48:06,552 --> 00:48:08,100
Rym: It depends on which one to use.

616
00:48:08,645 --> 00:48:11,283
Rym: I haven't actually used any of the Modern ones.

617
00:48:11,384 --> 00:48:24,762
Scott: it seems like even the ones that have the nice web GUI interfaces on them to just you know with the easy setup Basically still require you to understand, you know networking and mess networks and subnet masks and gateways and all that You know.

618
00:48:25,043 --> 00:48:28,120
Rym: if you listen to GeekNights, you should be learning these things from us bit by bit.

619
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,379
Scott: You should be but you know people got it.

620
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:33,660
Scott: You actually have to understand a lot of stuff to actually configure one of these things.

621
00:48:33,701 --> 00:48:37,789
Rym: Yeah, even if it has the simple GUI But at the same time we always get interesting feedback.

622
00:48:37,829 --> 00:48:44,840
Rym: how it seems like a lot of you like these episodes where we just kind Of explain how things work, but a lot of you also want the much more technical episodes.

623
00:48:45,081 --> 00:48:47,670
Rym: But that alienates the first half of you, but the latter it.

624
00:48:48,312 --> 00:48:48,814
Rym: so yeah.

625
00:48:49,094 --> 00:48:49,355
Scott: Yeah.

626
00:48:49,917 --> 00:48:50,700
Rym: How's the level of tech?

627
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:51,445
Rym: What do you guys want?

628
00:48:51,909 --> 00:48:52,736
Rym: That's what I'm asking.

629
00:48:52,938 --> 00:49:01,039
Rym: Yep And on that note, it's warm today warm yesterday Even warmer today, so I'm gonna turn the air conditioner back on.

630
00:49:07,712 --> 00:49:10,319
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

631
00:49:10,339 --> 00:49:12,504
