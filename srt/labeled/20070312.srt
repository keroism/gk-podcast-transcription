1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,376
Scott: It's Monday March 12.

2
00:00:11,376 --> 00:00:11,958
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,198 --> 00:00:14,043
Scott: I'm Rym and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:14,785 --> 00:00:16,509
Scott: We have no internets.

5
00:00:18,072 --> 00:00:19,108
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:22,893 --> 00:00:37,922
Rym: So all of our faithful listeners might have noticed that there was in fact no show last Thursday night Which is a rare occurrence because it's very not often that we miss a show here Especially when there's no conventions or other weird things going on.

7
00:00:37,982 --> 00:00:40,730
Scott: that are pretty much the only thing they can stop us from making shows.

8
00:00:41,031 --> 00:00:44,243
Rym: Yeah, I mean when we lays out we usually have another excuse.

9
00:00:44,304 --> 00:00:48,759
Rym: in addition and this time We were pretty much destroyed from all fronts.

10
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,925
Rym: You see our internet connection went down now.

11
00:00:50,966 --> 00:00:51,949
Rym: It didn't just go down.

12
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:55,063
Rym: it went Down and it's still not up.

13
00:00:55,586 --> 00:00:56,410
Scott: This is real bad.

14
00:00:56,811 --> 00:01:07,339
Rym: Yeah, we're having to record the show go over to a friend's house with a flash drive and then upload it And i'm not liking this at all.

15
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,183
Scott: no it's bad.

16
00:01:08,344 --> 00:01:12,000
Rym: see now a few weeks ago I mean our internet is stupid fast.

17
00:01:12,161 --> 00:01:14,310
Rym: It's always been incredibly fast.

18
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:22,630
Scott: Yeah, I mean it's not an oc3 But like I expect not I don't expect much from the local cable or dsl company.

19
00:01:22,771 --> 00:01:25,870
Scott: I expect them to give me something faster than dial-up.

20
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:40,704
Scott: That's good enough to watch youtube our cable vision, you know as as whatever and I regardless of what else I have to say about that company and certain things they do while they own madison square garden and such Optima online is pretty good.

21
00:01:41,127 --> 00:01:46,009
Scott: I mean It it's what we get like 13 down and two up or something like that.

22
00:01:46,271 --> 00:01:50,690
Scott: Yeah unlimited and they don't filter us on anything and we get that all the time.

23
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:52,819
Rym: Our internet speed really never drops ever.

24
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,170
Rym: It's always just this amazing never-ending beast.

25
00:01:55,270 --> 00:02:04,910
Scott: I'm sure part of it is because no one else on our in our area like living on our street probably has Or none or none or none or none or none or none of them use it enough to take away our bandwidth.

26
00:02:05,231 --> 00:02:08,884
Rym: Well, even if they did there aren't many houses near us period yeah.

27
00:02:09,507 --> 00:02:12,335
Scott: and also You know They don't seem to care what we do.

28
00:02:12,395 --> 00:02:16,475
Scott: we can bit torrent and we can do whatever we want and optum online doesn't really seem to care.

29
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:27,130
Rym: so a couple weeks ago randomly, we started losing internet like our cable modem would just Lose sync for a little bit and then our network would go down for like a minute and then it would come back.

30
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:30,629
Scott: Yeah, i'd go and unplug the cable modem plug it back in and it would work again.

31
00:02:30,931 --> 00:02:32,198
Scott: So i'd be like, all right, we're back up now.

32
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:34,470
Rym: It wasn't happening with any increasing frequency.

33
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,181
Rym: It just happened on this semi-regular basis starting suddenly.

34
00:02:37,281 --> 00:02:40,690
Rym: So whatever we figured if this keeps up We're going to call and make a complaint.

35
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:45,063
Rym: And then one day I believe this was thursday.

36
00:02:45,143 --> 00:02:45,404
Scott: Yes.

37
00:02:45,485 --> 00:02:46,950
Scott: Well, here's what happened thursday, right?

38
00:02:47,931 --> 00:02:48,854
Scott: So I bought this.

39
00:02:48,995 --> 00:02:52,689
Scott: I ordered this laptop because I gave back my old laptop to the job.

40
00:02:52,749 --> 00:02:54,702
Scott: I quit So I had to buy a new one.

41
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:55,730
Scott: So I bought a new one.

42
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,501
Scott: I ordered it from Fujitsu the company that makes it now.

43
00:02:58,622 --> 00:03:02,355
Rym: never mind all the shipping issues got had You mean like how?

44
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:05,986
Scott: I ordered it in the middle of february and it didn't come until thursday.

45
00:03:06,006 --> 00:03:06,487
Scott: Yeah.

46
00:03:06,628 --> 00:03:11,029
Scott: Yeah Uh, yeah, and how ups sucks and doesn't accommodate people who work all day.

47
00:03:11,432 --> 00:03:13,021
Rym: But no scott gets it and he opens it up.

48
00:03:13,061 --> 00:03:14,127
Rym: He's really excited about it.

49
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:16,217
Rym: I gotta admit It's a really nice cool little laptop.

50
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:17,442
Rym: I really like it.

51
00:03:17,502 --> 00:03:18,386
Rym: It's I like it.

52
00:03:18,466 --> 00:03:18,948
Rym: What can I say?

53
00:03:19,068 --> 00:03:19,390
Rym: It's good.

54
00:03:19,914 --> 00:03:21,610
Rym: So he's starting to set it all up.

55
00:03:21,691 --> 00:03:27,670
Rym: So he starts, you know Let's vista boot and he'll talk about vista later because it took a while to boot the first time a long time.

56
00:03:28,153 --> 00:03:33,779
Rym: But then he goes on the wireless to try to download firefox And he starts getting concerned because it's not.

57
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:40,649
Scott: the internet is really really slow and it would have taken me It said firefox downloading five hours and I was like what?

58
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,177
Scott: Firefox shouldn't take five hours to download.

59
00:03:43,518 --> 00:03:47,816
Rym: so I go upstairs and I get on my computer just to look and My internet's fine.

60
00:03:47,956 --> 00:03:49,724
Rym: I get it stupid fast like always.

61
00:03:49,744 --> 00:03:51,534
Rym: so I come back down and say hey scott It's fine.

62
00:03:51,575 --> 00:03:52,603
Rym: Something's wrong with your laptop.

63
00:03:52,623 --> 00:03:53,410
Rym: So he's worried.

64
00:03:53,571 --> 00:04:01,398
Scott: So I plug the wire in instead of using the wireless and it's still That it's not working at all for a second.

65
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,770
Rym: so scott's can't download anything and he's getting kind of worried about this.

66
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:05,899
Rym: He's looking for drivers.

67
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,150
Rym: Maybe so there's a conflict.

68
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,922
Rym: Maybe there's something wrong with it because every time his is slow.

69
00:04:10,942 --> 00:04:13,550
Rym: I go upstairs to my computer and it's fine.

70
00:04:13,911 --> 00:04:16,721
Scott: That was only really like two times three times three times.

71
00:04:16,963 --> 00:04:17,906
Scott: I don't think it was three times.

72
00:04:17,927 --> 00:04:18,610
Rym: It was three times.

73
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:25,383
Scott: Anyway, it was fast for me for like a minute and I was able to download firefox at in I don't know six seconds when it was working properly.

74
00:04:25,423 --> 00:04:26,510
Scott: It took the download firefox.

75
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:29,277
Scott: Yeah, it's real fast when it works.

76
00:04:29,658 --> 00:04:35,570
Scott: Anyway a little while later it after being slow It just stopped working entirely.

77
00:04:35,883 --> 00:04:52,829
Rym: Yep You see the timing was that every time I went upstairs and it happened to be working again And then every time I went downstairs it happened to not be working again And it was basically this binary boolean situation of on off On off and then one time it just went off and didn't come back

78
00:04:53,472 --> 00:05:01,449
Scott: And it you know, what would happen is I would look at the modal modem and it has Basically, the only light that matters because it's got like six lights on it.

79
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:10,621
Scott: The only light that matters is the one that says cable and basically if it's getting a signal from the cable company Then that light will turn on and stay on.

80
00:05:11,123 --> 00:05:12,670
Scott: if that light is off you're in trouble.

81
00:05:12,971 --> 00:05:23,390
Scott: And if that light is blinking that means it's trying to get a signal now occasionally for like a on Friday like the light would stay on for a bit, but you wouldn't actually be able to do anything.

82
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,639
Scott: We got like 56 packet loss.

83
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:28,370
Rym: Yeah, so every other package just doesn't make it where it's going.

84
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,337
Rym: You can't really do anything on the internet that way.

85
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:38,130
Scott: Yeah, and while tcpip we talked about has reliability stuff going on If you lose that many packets, you basically can't do anything.

86
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:55,170
Rym: I mean you could but like firefox and most applications that you use in a normal basis are not equipped to use Sort of thing sort of thing sort of thing sort of thing sort of thing and tcpip in a packet loss situation Can actually end up being worse than udp because of the act stuff, but i'm not going to get into that.

87
00:05:55,337 --> 00:05:55,488
Rym: Yeah

88
00:05:55,951 --> 00:06:17,503
Scott: But you know, there's also the problem of uh timeouts where even if you're losing 56 percent of the packets and you're resending packets That you missed okay, so you're getting 46 Performance which is actually a lot less than 46 performance because the way things work It just takes so long to load the web page and you know Your web browser will just give up if it takes too long to get it.

89
00:06:17,604 --> 00:06:19,010
Scott: So you can't do anything at all.

90
00:06:19,473 --> 00:06:21,750
Rym: Yeah old web browsers would be a lot more patient.

91
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:27,011
Rym: I remember going to websites back in the day where i'd have to sit there for three or four minutes waiting for each page to Load.

92
00:06:27,212 --> 00:06:35,329
Scott: I mean, i'm sure I could have gone to about config and changed the timeout in firefox and loaded a page or two But is it really worth my time to sit there for an hour?

93
00:06:36,233 --> 00:06:37,349
Scott: To load one web page?

94
00:06:37,691 --> 00:06:44,790
Rym: So the one thing we were able to determine when we got onto the optimum site once was that there was in fact a regional outage.

95
00:06:45,311 --> 00:06:52,350
Scott: Well, I went to optonline.net to look at the system status, which is pretty handy that they put their system status on the internet.

96
00:06:52,651 --> 00:06:57,390
Rym: So so if my internet's down I can log on to their website and find out if my internet's down.

97
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:10,953
Scott: Yeah, and basically all it said was that you know The cable tv was a-okay the phone that because they have digital phone service It was a-okay and that internet service was having issues and I was like, okay They're having issues.

98
00:07:11,194 --> 00:07:13,242
Scott: that explains it and I let it be at that.

99
00:07:13,603 --> 00:07:17,717
Scott: now you every time they've had issues in the past It's always been fixed, you know by the next day.

100
00:07:18,058 --> 00:07:21,950
Scott: We woke up the next morning on friday and it wasn't working at all.

101
00:07:22,331 --> 00:07:29,870
Rym: I tried to do my morning ritual and I was paralyzed by the fact that I could not read penny arcade Nor could I get into google reader or look at dig?

102
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:33,330
Scott: Well, I had no choice but to go to work, which I did.

103
00:07:33,651 --> 00:07:40,130
Rym: I also went to work after grousing to scott as I passed him that the internet's not working and then we got home on friday.

104
00:07:40,776 --> 00:07:41,866
Scott: It still wasn't working.

105
00:07:42,068 --> 00:07:45,297
Rym: So Worse than ever.

106
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,509
Rym: so eventually scott calls alex.

107
00:07:48,212 --> 00:07:55,660
Scott: Well, I called alex just because he also has optimum online but lives in our town But not in our house and he was having no problems at all.

108
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:55,961
Rym: Yeah.

109
00:07:55,981 --> 00:07:59,114
Rym: In fact, he hadn't had a problem from the start Huh?

110
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:06,510
Rym: So then scott tries to call the optimum online help number which you think would be an easy thing to do.

111
00:08:06,821 --> 00:08:17,589
Scott: Yeah Well, here's the problem is I look in the phone book for cable vision because that's the company that provides optimum online And I find their number for our area duchess county and I call it and it gives you the.

112
00:08:17,689 --> 00:08:18,897
Scott: you know The phone menu.

113
00:08:18,977 --> 00:08:22,014
Scott: press one for english, you know I push one for english.

114
00:08:22,475 --> 00:08:31,827
Scott: and then they say push one if you want to pay your bill push two if you want to do Right, it's like push two for service appointments and repair related activities.

115
00:08:31,967 --> 00:08:34,878
Scott: and I was like Okay, that's not the option I need.

116
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,246
Scott: that was the option I needed.

117
00:08:36,285 --> 00:08:42,027
Scott: if you push two Then it says push one for internet push two for cable and push three for phone.

118
00:08:42,047 --> 00:08:50,355
Scott: you push one for internet And then it says, you know to talk to customer service push this next number and i'm like, oh god damn And it was totally.

119
00:08:50,376 --> 00:08:52,770
Scott: the menu system did not point me in the right direction.

120
00:08:52,830 --> 00:09:01,428
Scott: So for the longest time I thought that there was another number I had to call to get the correct menu option And it took me like 30 minutes just to call the right number.

121
00:09:01,468 --> 00:09:01,850
Scott: It sucked.

122
00:09:02,392 --> 00:09:05,282
Rym: So eventually we get through and they say, you know, oh we'll send a tech out.

123
00:09:05,623 --> 00:09:08,172
Rym: and they send a tech out and the mystery begins To deepen.

124
00:09:08,433 --> 00:09:09,476
Scott: well, here's the thing.

125
00:09:09,496 --> 00:09:13,409
Scott: Remember how I was complaining about ups not accommodating people who aren't home all day?

126
00:09:13,972 --> 00:09:16,542
Scott: Well cable vision doesn't accommodate people who aren't home all day.

127
00:09:16,603 --> 00:09:17,225
Scott: that well either.

128
00:09:17,285 --> 00:09:18,290
Rym: they do it a lot better.

129
00:09:18,872 --> 00:09:21,183
Scott: They do it better than ups but not that much better.

130
00:09:21,223 --> 00:09:33,609
Scott: your choices are during the week You can have someone come like in a three-hour window like between 10 and Like one or one and four or five and eight or something like that.

131
00:09:34,131 --> 00:09:37,309
Scott: None of those are good for someone who's out of the house seven to seven every day.

132
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:39,270
Scott: So they can come on the weekend.

133
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:42,721
Scott: But if they come on the weekend, they promise they'll come between 10 a.m.

134
00:09:42,761 --> 00:09:54,290
Scott: And 8 p.m So it's like fuck you 10 a.m And 8 p.m You've got to sit in your house or be close to your house for 10 hours out of the day.

135
00:09:54,470 --> 00:10:00,090
Rym: I particularly like how they said oh, he'll call before he comes and there was no call.

136
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:03,388
Rym: But yet suddenly out of the blue this optim online truck appears.

137
00:10:03,468 --> 00:10:08,790
Scott: Yep I mean like in the day before they came because I the appointment I made was for when?

138
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,336
Scott: Sunday, right on saturday.

139
00:10:11,356 --> 00:10:14,929
Scott: They called me twice to let me to make sure that we wanted the guy to come sunday.

140
00:10:15,522 --> 00:10:16,630
Scott: Yeah All right.

141
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:22,430
Rym: So the guy showed up and first he goes and looks at the outside part And he sees a bunch of old stuff and he replaces it.

142
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,735
Rym: He's like, yeah, this stuff's old It has never been replaced.

143
00:10:25,177 --> 00:10:27,870
Rym: and then he comes inside and he tests and he doesn't get any signal.

144
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:31,965
Rym: Then he tested another hole and he doesn't get any signal and he tested another hole.

145
00:10:32,045 --> 00:10:33,330
Rym: He gets a weak ass signal.

146
00:10:34,011 --> 00:10:36,809
Rym: So see starts telling us that the lines inside our house are bad.

147
00:10:37,272 --> 00:10:40,308
Rym: But then just to be sure because he's got a nagging kind of huh?

148
00:10:41,151 --> 00:10:48,607
Rym: He goes back outside and he climbs up the pole in front of our house And he fills around up there for like 10 minutes and he comes back down.

149
00:10:48,647 --> 00:10:49,998
Rym: He tests in the house He goes back up there.

150
00:10:50,018 --> 00:10:55,466
Rym: He's going around for a while And basically there are numerous issues here and they still haven't solved them all.

151
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:59,690
Rym: for one The wiring inside of our house the coaxial cables.

152
00:11:00,511 --> 00:11:01,858
Rym: No one knows where they go.

153
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,547
Rym: They're just kind of this mess.

154
00:11:03,687 --> 00:11:11,850
Rym: i'm thinking Whenever I get free time like next weekend before they come I'm going to disconnect all of our stuff plug my fluke in and see if I can trace this stuff out through the wall.

155
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,830
Scott: I don't know where the hell this stuff goes.

156
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:19,929
Scott: I mean it goes from the pole outside To our house down the side of the house into this box.

157
00:11:20,632 --> 00:11:29,930
Scott: Then they come out of the box and into a hole in the foundation of the house And then there are mystery coaxial holes appearing throughout the house in random places.

158
00:11:30,293 --> 00:11:31,950
Scott: Yeah, I don't know where this thing comes out.

159
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:43,998
Rym: I mean it has to split at some point because now obviously I know what happened here because this happens a lot in older houses Someone who builds a house and doesn't know much about anything or actually a lot of people Who have a pre-existing house do this too.

160
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,528
Rym: They get cable then they have a bunch of TVs.

161
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:50,801
Rym: now They don't know anything about signal loss or degradation or attenuation.

162
00:11:50,861 --> 00:11:53,930
Rym: So they just buy a bunch of splitters stick them all over the place.

163
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:59,569
Rym: So they have coaxial going every room in the house and then they wonder whether cable tv is fuzzy and their internet doesn't work.

164
00:12:00,613 --> 00:12:07,765
Rym: Ah, so inside of our walls are coaxial cables that go about in various directions Which was never a problem before.

165
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:18,080
Rym: in fact Our internet was stupid fast before despite the fact that one of the cables we're using which goes across my room and into the hall Where all of our network equipment is is stupidly bad.

166
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:20,367
Rym: Like it's a terrible coaxial cable.

167
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:21,230
Rym: He tested.

168
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:22,475
Rym: He's like that cable is bad.

169
00:12:22,556 --> 00:12:23,058
Rym: Don't use it.

170
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:24,745
Scott: Yeah, but it still works.

171
00:12:25,107 --> 00:12:25,710
Rym: It will it works.

172
00:12:26,651 --> 00:12:33,337
Rym: See the issue is apparently he tests on the on the pole and he says yeah It looks like at the pole.

173
00:12:33,698 --> 00:12:38,190
Rym: You're like 12 decibels below what you should be at the signal's real weak.

174
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:44,150
Rym: So the signal was just strong enough before to get through that crappy wiring in your house to get to your cable modem.

175
00:12:44,533 --> 00:12:49,129
Rym: But now that the outside signal drops It's not going to cut it with that crappy wiring anymore.

176
00:12:49,631 --> 00:12:55,589
Scott: So supposedly today while I was at work some guys came and fixed the stuff outside on the pole.

177
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:59,570
Rym: now The actual answer is that nothing has changed as far as we can tell.

178
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:07,742
Scott: Yeah, I mean I can look outside because I saw the spot where the original guy was working And I looked there and the equipment had changed.

179
00:13:07,782 --> 00:13:10,110
Scott: there is new stuff on the wires outside.

180
00:13:10,672 --> 00:13:13,163
Scott: It hasn't changed anything with the inside situation at all.

181
00:13:13,524 --> 00:13:14,810
Scott: I have no internet none.

182
00:13:15,551 --> 00:13:21,908
Scott: And I called the internet guys to be like, hey, it's still not working and they're like, oh shits You're the top priority fix now blah blah blah.

183
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:29,840
Scott: But the guy at you know at the cable company they can test to see if they can get a signal to you with their equipment And he's like, yeah, I got no signal to you man.

184
00:13:30,221 --> 00:13:31,486
Scott: And i'm like, that's fantastic.

185
00:13:31,808 --> 00:13:32,370
Scott: You're awesome.

186
00:13:32,993 --> 00:13:40,389
Rym: Now I love how before they said oh someone will come within 48 hours But now that we're a priority case someone will come within a week.

187
00:13:40,831 --> 00:13:42,880
Scott: Well, they'll come when I make an appointment.

188
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:48,161
Scott: I could make an appointment for like wednesday Between 10 and 1 but people go to work.

189
00:13:50,351 --> 00:13:51,558
Scott: People can't be home.

190
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:52,463
Rym: What the fuck?

191
00:13:52,684 --> 00:13:58,388
Rym: Yeah, luckily Dear emily is hanging around for spring break working on animation and other things.

192
00:13:58,468 --> 00:14:06,990
Rym: So Hopefully we will be able to let her sit here and meet this stupid cable guy And let him do whatever he needs to do to get GeekNights back on the road.

193
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:16,750
Rym: Yeah, if she wasn't here, I would have had to sit here and meet the cable guy at 10 am on Saturday which also would have put a little bit of a damper on all of our plans to go out to albany and hang out With.

194
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:24,726
Scott: that might still be the case, but tomorrow I will try to call and reschedule To get the early wednesday when emily is here and i'll tell her everything to tell the guy.

195
00:14:24,766 --> 00:14:34,670
Scott: and also supposedly They are going to send out Senior type, you know the highest level of senior technician who will come and not leave until everything is fixed.

196
00:14:35,112 --> 00:14:38,809
Rym: At least while the guy scott was talking to on the phone was not the most knowledgeable guy.

197
00:14:39,413 --> 00:14:42,010
Rym: The tech they sent out to our house knew what he was doing.

198
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:45,201
Rym: Enough to identify the problem and then leave.

199
00:14:45,382 --> 00:14:47,590
Scott: yeah anyone who has that job, you know knows enough.

200
00:14:48,014 --> 00:14:49,470
Scott: You can't get that job and not know anything.

201
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:53,589
Scott: You'd go to places and just be blah and then people would all be upset to be useless.

202
00:14:53,609 --> 00:15:01,084
Scott: Yep He had the real fluke too the kind of fluke I always wanted like imagine if I showed up at a house to be A cable guy and i'd be like, yeah, i'm here to fix your cable.

203
00:15:01,345 --> 00:15:06,164
Scott: and then I was just like, uh Okay, bye i've seen that happen before.

204
00:15:06,445 --> 00:15:07,330
Rym: really i've had.

205
00:15:07,691 --> 00:15:12,610
Rym: When I lived in michigan, we had a cable guy come to try to fix our cable and he basically tracked mud into the house.

206
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:13,756
Rym: That was all he accomplished.

207
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:18,209
Rym: Wow his stellar, dude Okay.

208
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:22,810
Rym: So yeah, there's gonna be no things today because I don't have the internet in front of me.

209
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:31,359
Rym: In fact, I haven't been on the internet since thursday Morning, I was able to do some stuff at work today.

210
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:34,570
Scott: But in my new job, I actually work a lot see curse of curses.

211
00:15:35,311 --> 00:15:42,978
Rym: I had work to do on friday and I had even more work to do on monday today And I didn't even touch a computer.

212
00:15:42,998 --> 00:15:46,070
Rym: I got online at my office for five minutes.

213
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:49,029
Rym: I checked my email to make sure there was nothing critical going on.

214
00:15:49,391 --> 00:15:53,590
Rym: I looked into forums to make sure everybody wasn't dead and then I went to do my business.

215
00:15:54,531 --> 00:15:56,620
Scott: This is really not so good at all.

216
00:15:56,941 --> 00:16:01,400
Rym: Yes, especially since listenership is up Not that any of you care, but we're good.

217
00:16:01,682 --> 00:16:03,330
Rym: It seems like things are really picking up suddenly.

218
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:07,066
Rym: I don't know if it was because of katsukan or just randomly but whatever it doesn't help.

219
00:16:07,206 --> 00:16:08,030
Scott: also that you know.

220
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,374
Scott: Hey, I got this new laptop.

221
00:16:09,434 --> 00:16:21,448
Scott: I'd really like to you know install software install software on it possibly download some Ubuntu packages But no, there's no internet and the wireless internet at work Doesn't work.

222
00:16:22,174 --> 00:16:24,409
Scott: So and there isn't an extra wire at my desk.

223
00:16:24,891 --> 00:16:33,389
Scott: So i'm pretty much sol with this thing until uh, you know that I waited half a month to get it And now I can't do anything with it except uh watch dvds.

224
00:16:34,052 --> 00:16:41,424
Rym: Thus tonight we are going to talk about the ramifications Of not having internet access in an age of internet.

225
00:16:41,545 --> 00:16:50,230
Rym: because you see this is a problem that It really wasn't a problem In recent memory and has become a problem for me in my life and in scott's life in a lot of geek's lives.

226
00:16:50,632 --> 00:17:08,430
Rym: I mean think about it way back when you had a computer before I don't know how many of you are old enough But when you had a computer before the internet when maybe you could dial into prodigy online or aol The computer in and of itself was entertaining and useful you would use your computer whether or not there was an internet connection.

227
00:17:08,752 --> 00:17:16,430
Rym: I mean I would go to my computer and do stuff And many times I wouldn't even bother dialing into prodigy like I only dialed in if I needed to go online for something.

228
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:20,123
Scott: I think a lot of that was that in those days.

229
00:17:20,143 --> 00:17:24,698
Scott: I was actually doing A lot of word processing type stuff.

230
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:28,950
Scott: I was doing a lot of pc games that were not network pc games.

231
00:17:29,051 --> 00:17:32,130
Rym: I was also playing with the computer just learning about computers a lot.

232
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:35,702
Scott: Yeah, I was playing with the computer itself because the computer itself.

233
00:17:35,963 --> 00:17:37,348
Scott: I still had things to learn about it.

234
00:17:37,769 --> 00:17:53,624
Scott: now There's nothing for me to learn about the computer i'm holding, you know The only thing I can learn is by getting information from other people using the computers as a tool, you know It's like I spent when you don't know about computers the computer itself learning.

235
00:17:53,664 --> 00:17:55,930
Scott: This is crazy advanced tool is interesting.

236
00:17:56,273 --> 00:17:57,908
Scott: It's sort of like if I had a fluke, right?

237
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:00,579
Scott: Uh, the fluke is such a crazy advanced tool.

238
00:18:00,719 --> 00:18:06,064
Scott: just having one even having nothing to do with it Would be fun because i'd poke around and learn all the things it can.

239
00:18:06,104 --> 00:18:07,350
Rym: do you want to play with my fluke?

240
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:08,480
Scott: No, not really.

241
00:18:08,601 --> 00:18:17,158
Scott: I got better things to do But once I learned everything it would just sit there and I have no use for it unless I suddenly have a use for it Which I do.

242
00:18:17,219 --> 00:18:18,009
Rym: i'm excited about this.

243
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:27,247
Rym: I'm gonna use the fluke's uh cable finding technology to figure out where these coaxial cables are And maybe hunt down where these repeaters are or splitters are or whatever and get rid of them.

244
00:18:27,589 --> 00:18:29,438
Scott: Yep Well, we need to split something.

245
00:18:29,499 --> 00:18:30,665
Scott: So the old lady has cable.

246
00:18:30,765 --> 00:18:34,040
Rym: Well, theoretically She should have a separate drop.

247
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,490
Rym: So I don't know what's going on with cable vision in the first place.

248
00:18:36,771 --> 00:18:37,513
Scott: Yeah, I figured they.

249
00:18:37,654 --> 00:18:40,203
Scott: I think they think hey, it's one house one wire.

250
00:18:40,263 --> 00:18:42,290
Scott: save money, you know, and it still works.

251
00:18:42,391 --> 00:18:43,238
Scott: It worked for a while.

252
00:18:43,318 --> 00:18:44,367
Scott: So what's the deal?

253
00:18:44,609 --> 00:18:48,230
Rym: Yeah Well, i'm gonna track it down because this I don't get to do stuff like that anymore.

254
00:18:48,230 --> 00:19:03,769
Rym: I mean my job all my jobs have moved so far away from Looking at cables and doing the fun stuff to where basically like I supervise And I I say what to do or I write up documentation after the fact or I push paper around.

255
00:19:05,051 --> 00:19:08,407
Rym: Granted I don't like crawling under floors so much but I like using flukes.

256
00:19:08,528 --> 00:19:08,990
Rym: What can I say?

257
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:15,418
Scott: It's fun to use tools and that's why it's fun to use the computer because the computer Is an all-purpose amazing.

258
00:19:15,438 --> 00:19:26,917
Scott: It's pretty much the best tool ever and using it is fun And once you know how to use it It's no longer fun unless you have a use sort of like if you got a hammer And you learn how to use the hammer.

259
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:33,428
Scott: It's fun to just hammer nails for no reason, but once you've done that Is the hammer is no fun without actual nailing to do.

260
00:19:33,448 --> 00:19:40,449
Rym: yeah I mean, I remember when I was a kid the first time my dad or my grandpa just let me play with a hammer And I just hammered nails into a board for like an hour.

261
00:19:40,852 --> 00:19:48,870
Rym: And seriously, I was playing with this hammer and this wrench and all these tools They gave me and I I ended up screwing a bunch of screws and nailing a bunch of nails into this one piece of wood.

262
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:50,649
Scott: But now we have a hammer don't we?

263
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:56,450
Rym: Yeah, well actually then it wasn't that much later that my grandpa was building something and he wanted my help.

264
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:02,307
Rym: So I was nailing a bunch of boards together and it stopped being fun after about 10 seconds.

265
00:20:02,929 --> 00:20:06,124
Rym: Yep So then fast forward a little bit to middle school now.

266
00:20:06,145 --> 00:20:12,863
Rym: I got a cable modem I get I go online with like five or six ie windows open go to all different websites.

267
00:20:13,324 --> 00:20:21,628
Rym: I have friends online friends who I have Only online and I have friends in the town that I only talk to online because none of us call each other.

268
00:20:21,728 --> 00:20:23,517
Rym: phones are There weren't cell phones?

269
00:20:23,558 --> 00:20:24,523
Scott: phones are so 1800s, man.

270
00:20:26,152 --> 00:20:29,970
Rym: I mean seriously though that like in middle school and even early high school.

271
00:20:30,493 --> 00:20:34,610
Rym: It was weird because cell phones really weren't around yet Like we had a cell phone.

272
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:41,685
Rym: But it's not like I could just call my friends on that cell phone because it cost like a dollar a minute to use it And the battery lasted about 45 minutes.

273
00:20:43,156 --> 00:20:51,098
Rym: but I communicated with all my friends via icq online and I never used aol Those even aol users.

274
00:20:51,239 --> 00:20:58,310
Scott: I was all with the aol's mostly because they didn't have a choice like I knew that aol was no good, you know.

275
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:09,830
Scott: But I didn't have a choice other than dial up because nothing else was available in the area at the time And I was trying to figure out and research what was the correct thing to get but in the end I had no choice.

276
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:15,110
Scott: I got aol and that's what we had for a few years until eventually my parents got the dsl.

277
00:21:15,412 --> 00:21:21,070
Rym: But even then when the internet went down It wasn't a big deal like like when I was a freshman in high school or when I was in eighth grade.

278
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:25,910
Rym: Like if I walked into the rec room and I couldn't get online I saw the cable modem was blinking.

279
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:31,890
Rym: I would have this son of a bitch moment and then I'd just go do something else because it's not like I needed the internet.

280
00:21:32,031 --> 00:21:33,476
Rym: All that communication could wait.

281
00:21:33,857 --> 00:21:37,450
Rym: It's not like news was coming at this incredible rate on the internet.

282
00:21:37,572 --> 00:21:38,730
Rym: It wasn't news that I cared about.

283
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:43,950
Scott: I mean in the aol days i'd be kind of pissed if I couldn't get on aol because that was sort of like.

284
00:21:44,030 --> 00:22:00,645
Scott: You know the the coolest thing to do on the computer is to go and chat room or go and play A mud or something like that or visit a website, you know, it was sort of like if you had a a game console And one of the games your favorite game was only available sometimes.

285
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,235
Scott: so if the game's not available It's not the biggest deal, you know.

286
00:22:03,275 --> 00:22:14,098
Scott: if you came into my house and took like, you know The the the we game that i'm playing at the moment like out of the house for like an hour a day That wouldn't really bother me so much.

287
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:14,420
Rym: Yeah.

288
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:18,458
Rym: I mean back then when the cable went out It was like cable tv going out.

289
00:22:18,498 --> 00:22:19,040
Rym: I just all right.

290
00:22:19,201 --> 00:22:21,029
Rym: I got to do something else and it wasn't a big deal.

291
00:22:21,972 --> 00:22:23,446
Rym: Fast forward we're at rit.

292
00:22:24,912 --> 00:22:30,257
Rym: If the if the internet went out which happened once or twice There was we were stuck.

293
00:22:30,719 --> 00:22:32,083
Rym: We was like having no electricity.

294
00:22:32,103 --> 00:22:34,030
Rym: the power had might as well have been out.

295
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:43,326
Rym: In fact the power being out as opposed to just the internet being out was preferable Because if the power was out then now everything's all interesting.

296
00:22:43,366 --> 00:22:47,183
Rym: We can't turn on lights We all get together and play board games by candlelight.

297
00:22:47,203 --> 00:22:48,530
Rym: it was always fun when that happened.

298
00:22:49,073 --> 00:22:50,400
Scott: Yeah, power outs are awesome.

299
00:22:50,622 --> 00:22:52,411
Scott: blackouts blackouts rule I.

300
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:57,050
Rym: I have to admit that I have had fun in just about every blackout that i've ever lived through.

301
00:22:57,712 --> 00:23:00,340
Scott: Actually, the uh, the job that I just quit was very.

302
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,366
Scott: the people there were very fond of blackouts.

303
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:03,450
Scott: They love the blackouts.

304
00:23:04,012 --> 00:23:05,697
Scott: They were there during the big blackout.

305
00:23:06,099 --> 00:23:10,652
Rym: I was directing traffic during the big blackout and that morning I was.

306
00:23:10,672 --> 00:23:11,837
Scott: why were you directing traffic?

307
00:23:12,038 --> 00:23:18,709
Rym: because I had nothing else to do and traffic was snarled up near my house And I was out riding my bike watching the chaos as people tried to commute home.

308
00:23:19,474 --> 00:23:22,410
Rym: Uh, okay, so I just went out and directed traffic at this intersection.

309
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:24,990
Rym: It was fun because I saw other people doing it at other intersections.

310
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:26,154
Scott: Oh, okay.

311
00:23:26,576 --> 00:23:30,170
Rym: I should tell the story of what happened to me during that blackout some other time.

312
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:32,958
Scott: Yeah, because because that was a funny story the black.

313
00:23:32,998 --> 00:23:48,109
Rym: Yes, it was but I will say this I was standing Amidst a giant data center at a factory and ibm working on a server When the power outage happened and the power went out in the data center and I didn't know what to do.

314
00:23:48,772 --> 00:23:50,999
Rym: I was not prepared for that eventuality.

315
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,748
Rym: That was the last thing I expected to happen that day.

316
00:23:53,768 --> 00:23:55,194
Scott: All right Anyway, all right.

317
00:23:55,294 --> 00:24:07,090
Scott: Anyway, but if the internet goes out, it's sort of like If you're hammering if you're building something with your hammer and your nails And you run out of nails and you go to home depot and there's no nails for sale.

318
00:24:07,553 --> 00:24:09,288
Scott: But you're in the middle of building something.

319
00:24:09,871 --> 00:24:24,976
Scott: Because the internet all of us all of us on the internet us podcasting you listening to the podcast people on wikipedia We are all now Constantly collectively building a thing And we can't stop building it.

320
00:24:25,237 --> 00:24:26,801
Rym: It's a lot like ghost in the shell.

321
00:24:26,901 --> 00:24:29,890
Rym: Our cyber brains are slowly becoming parallel to one another.

322
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:37,861
Scott: it's like I don't know if we're all writing a big book together and then we all ran out of ink And it's not done yet.

323
00:24:37,981 --> 00:24:44,066
Rym: Think of this geeks like us Especially people who listen to podcasts and you know read slashdot or dig or fark or whatever that you're.

324
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:47,677
Rym: whenever you're on a computer You're almost constantly communicating.

325
00:24:47,998 --> 00:24:56,264
Rym: you are at many times throughout the day many many many times Continually in contact with hundreds if not thousands of other human beings.

326
00:24:56,605 --> 00:25:02,445
Rym: you have the ability to contact Almost anyone in the industrialized world at any moment if you want to.

327
00:25:02,846 --> 00:25:06,949
Scott: now, it's not so bad I mean, it's kind of bad if it all stops around the world.

328
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:12,230
Scott: But imagine if so everyone is working together on something and you're working with the team, right?

329
00:25:12,951 --> 00:25:26,830
Scott: And then you miss a meeting So everyone works on stuff without you for a whole meeting and you come back the next week And you totally missed what everyone worked on the last week and they made a bunch of progress And you weren't there to experience that progress and you don't know what's going on.

330
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:27,432
Scott: You're lost.

331
00:25:27,752 --> 00:25:33,910
Scott: You probably lost a lot more than just that one meeting's worth of input into the final result and it kind of sucks.

332
00:25:34,453 --> 00:25:46,313
Rym: Of course, there's also a lot of humor involved because I remember at rit One time the internet was out and I remember very specifically That I was sitting on the couch in the living room and scott was sitting on the couch in the living room and alex I think was over.

333
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:46,976
Rym: I forget who was over.

334
00:25:47,097 --> 00:25:49,186
Rym: we had a bunch of people over and we're sitting around.

335
00:25:49,226 --> 00:25:49,709
Rym: What are we gonna do?

336
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:51,643
Rym: Hey, let's order pizza.

337
00:25:52,067 --> 00:25:58,610
Rym: and I Automatically Just went over and sat in front of my computer because I was about to just go to the papa john's website and order pizza.

338
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,530
Rym: And I stopped as I was about to type and went god damn it.

339
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:04,397
Scott: So I said what's the phone number for the pizza?

340
00:26:04,498 --> 00:26:05,140
Rym: and I went.

341
00:26:05,241 --> 00:26:07,570
Rym: I just opened up my web browser typed google space.

342
00:26:07,651 --> 00:26:09,848
Rym: Then I stopped and went god damn it.

343
00:26:11,082 --> 00:26:18,281
Scott: I mean The problem we have is that we've replaced everything With the internet, you know, we don't go.

344
00:26:18,301 --> 00:26:20,030
Scott: we don't have maps from triple a anymore.

345
00:26:20,311 --> 00:26:22,298
Scott: We don't call it to order food.

346
00:26:22,639 --> 00:26:26,030
Scott: We don't use the phone book to find out phone numbers and addresses.

347
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:27,319
Rym: I mean, we're not saying the royal weeks.

348
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,770
Rym: I know a lot of people still use these things.

349
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:30,718
Rym: Oh, yeah, we're talking us personally mean scott.

350
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,370
Scott: We don't watch television for entertainment.

351
00:26:33,752 --> 00:26:35,201
Rym: We don't even have access to the radio.

352
00:26:35,443 --> 00:26:36,570
Rym: We don't have radios.

353
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:44,678
Rym: It would be difficult for like it would take a good bit of effort for us to get A working radio and listen to a radio station.

354
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:49,310
Scott: the only real things that we have to do without computers.

355
00:26:49,551 --> 00:26:52,449
Scott: I mean think about any creative endeavor you want to take on.

356
00:26:53,031 --> 00:26:55,980
Scott: Like if I decide that I want to paint a picture I need a computer.

357
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:05,770
Rym: actually see that's where I disagree with you because I While I couldn't do certain things that I wanted would have otherwise done and wanted to do in my life while the internet is down.

358
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:12,430
Rym: At the same time the internet being down does not in any way Bore me and I can still accomplish just as much without it.

359
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:16,274
Scott: Well, I can accomplish things but I can't accomplish a lot of things I want to like.

360
00:27:16,354 --> 00:27:21,235
Scott: I can read books and I could play ds games And I guess I could.

361
00:27:21,356 --> 00:27:22,239
Scott: I can't really write.

362
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,090
Scott: I guess I could write things because without the internet I can write.

363
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:25,652
Rym: So you think of this.

364
00:27:25,672 --> 00:27:32,115
Rym: the internet was down for this past, you know, several days over the weekend and friday and thursday I've read a bunch of books.

365
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:33,620
Rym: I started reading a bunch of books.

366
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,507
Scott: I finished all my comics except one.

367
00:27:35,707 --> 00:27:39,390
Rym: I Continued to write my epic guide to podcasting.

368
00:27:40,352 --> 00:27:42,082
Rym: I actually wrote two new chapters in it.

369
00:27:42,666 --> 00:27:46,780
Rym: I went running Every day I I cleaned my trumpet.

370
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,805
Rym: I buffed my trumpet.

371
00:27:47,825 --> 00:27:48,590
Rym: I polished it.

372
00:27:48,971 --> 00:27:51,682
Rym: I went out and tended to my bike to make sure the winner didn't destroy.

373
00:27:51,702 --> 00:27:52,606
Rym: I did laundry.

374
00:27:52,706 --> 00:27:53,590
Rym: I cleaned my room.

375
00:27:53,911 --> 00:27:54,856
Rym: We cleaned the house.

376
00:27:55,499 --> 00:27:56,584
Rym: I was never in the house.

377
00:27:56,624 --> 00:27:56,805
Scott: Yep.

378
00:27:56,885 --> 00:27:57,890
Scott: I was never banana bread.

379
00:27:58,392 --> 00:28:00,098
Rym: I was never at a loss for something to do.

380
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:06,810
Rym: and while it's annoying that I can't get all this information The quality of my life was not degraded significantly.

381
00:28:07,011 --> 00:28:11,790
Rym: Immediately the problem is as the internet continues to be out like each day that the internet is gone.

382
00:28:12,172 --> 00:28:19,829
Rym: The damage I am taking from not having internet increases Because I build up this queue of things That I want to look up or that I need to know or that I need to do.

383
00:28:19,849 --> 00:28:21,476
Rym: that I cannot do without the internet.

384
00:28:21,857 --> 00:28:31,030
Scott: It's kind of weird because like while I am slightly Like bored when I don't have the internet because I don't it takes me a while to think of what the hell to do.

385
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:33,530
Rym: Scott you're like a morphine addict when it comes to the internet.

386
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:39,470
Rym: Well, no i'm not because you were walking around the house and kind of like on edge friday when there was no internet.

387
00:28:39,571 --> 00:28:40,881
Scott: Well, but it's so weird.

388
00:28:40,921 --> 00:28:43,536
Scott: It's like if i'm in the house And there's no internet.

389
00:28:43,616 --> 00:28:45,830
Scott: i'm a little eh, you know, but i'll find something to do.

390
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:49,806
Scott: I'll eventually just you know reconcile to reading a book until I finish all my books.

391
00:28:50,027 --> 00:28:54,110
Scott: Oh those books Yeah, those books that I you know complain that I don't have time to finish reading.

392
00:28:54,691 --> 00:29:02,547
Scott: But if I go on vacation i'll go without internet for like months and I won't even blink or bat an eye or worry about It at all.

393
00:29:03,193 --> 00:29:06,910
Scott: But if i'm home and the internet's out, that's suddenly the end of the world.

394
00:29:07,131 --> 00:29:12,170
Rym: Well, I I think part of the reason that it doesn't bother me I mean obviously it's an inconvenience a great one.

395
00:29:12,692 --> 00:29:21,935
Rym: but the reason it doesn't bother me is that when I went on co-op both times when I was working at ibm then when I Graduated from rit and I kept working at ibm I didn't have internet access.

396
00:29:21,996 --> 00:29:25,730
Rym: And in fact, I used to live in the mountains out in poquoi at the top of pleasant ridge.

397
00:29:26,413 --> 00:29:35,596
Rym: Not only did I not have internet access not only was internet access not available out there in any form other than Barely functional.

398
00:29:35,596 --> 00:29:39,229
Rym: 336 dial-up 56k didn't work out there because the phone lines were old.

399
00:29:40,791 --> 00:29:43,639
Rym: My cell phone didn't work because I was on the mountain.

400
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:47,250
Rym: I had to drive 20 minutes down the mountain to make a phone call.

401
00:29:48,252 --> 00:29:51,349
Scott: I might try to figure out how to get my bluetooth dial-up networking to work.

402
00:29:51,852 --> 00:30:00,190
Rym: So as a result when I came home from work on any given day I was Absolutely out of communication with the entire world.

403
00:30:00,692 --> 00:30:08,308
Rym: No one could get a hold of me and I couldn't get a hold of anyone and as a result I basically lived for three months as a hermit.

404
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:12,670
Scott: Yeah, I don't want to be hermit like a techno hermit.

405
00:30:12,731 --> 00:30:13,497
Rym: I mean, it's.

406
00:30:13,678 --> 00:30:15,070
Rym: I mean, I think that is weird.

407
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:32,809
Rym: But pretty much every day I would come home from work at like four and i'd run for two or three hours And then i'd cook dinner and then i'd go to the bookstore and i'd read like an entire novel and then i'd come home And it would be like 10 and i'm not tired and the only thing I have to do the next day is go to work.

408
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,454
Scott: Uh, it's some life.

409
00:30:34,494 --> 00:30:36,624
Rym: There you got that actually the fact that it would see.

410
00:30:36,644 --> 00:30:41,679
Rym: the only reason I didn't go insane And take out a bus station or something Was that I knew it.

411
00:30:41,699 --> 00:30:43,770
Scott: was you planning to take out a bus station.

412
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:45,619
Rym: That's pretty much my default if things go wrong.

413
00:30:45,639 --> 00:30:46,483
Rym: I'm taking out a bus station.

414
00:30:46,503 --> 00:30:47,910
Scott: You really hate the buses that much.

415
00:30:48,533 --> 00:30:49,498
Rym: I really don't like buses.

416
00:30:49,518 --> 00:30:51,950
Rym: I got to admit i've never really had good experiences on non.

417
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,922
Scott: Why don't you take out something bad though?

418
00:30:53,962 --> 00:30:58,741
Scott: Like I don't know a chiropractor Something Go to an acupuncturist.

419
00:30:59,003 --> 00:30:59,626
Scott: Yeah, there you go.

420
00:30:59,646 --> 00:31:00,169
Scott: Take them out.

421
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,359
Rym: I don't know why bus station came to mind.

422
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,790
Rym: I'm really indifferent to bus stations me also.

423
00:31:05,011 --> 00:31:07,743
Rym: In fact, the last time I was at a bus station is when I picked up greg's friend.

424
00:31:07,803 --> 00:31:09,410
Rym: Meredith in rochester.

425
00:31:09,751 --> 00:31:14,727
Scott: I guess if you if you count walking past the uh, you know the the.

426
00:31:15,008 --> 00:31:15,690
Scott: what's the terminal?

427
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:17,073
Rym: What terminal?

428
00:31:17,194 --> 00:31:18,902
Scott: the one in the city the port authority?

429
00:31:18,922 --> 00:31:19,705
Scott: That's that the one?

430
00:31:19,806 --> 00:31:20,087
Scott: Yeah.

431
00:31:20,127 --> 00:31:20,650
Scott: Yeah that one.

432
00:31:20,892 --> 00:31:22,209
Rym: I haven't walked by that in a while.

433
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:23,396
Scott: Well, we we did.

434
00:31:23,436 --> 00:31:24,060
Rym: we walked by it.

435
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,850
Rym: when you're going to the comic con I didn't go in there.

436
00:31:26,011 --> 00:31:27,801
Scott: No, i've never actually been in there ever.

437
00:31:28,063 --> 00:31:28,425
Rym: Oh, really?

438
00:31:28,445 --> 00:31:29,350
Rym: I've been in there a couple times.

439
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:31,830
Scott: I've never gone in there because why should I go in there?

440
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:32,475
Scott: I never get on a bus.

441
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:35,798
Rym: when new york city was new and shiny to me I wandered in there because I was curious.

442
00:31:35,858 --> 00:31:37,164
Rym: I wandered into a lot of places.

443
00:31:37,184 --> 00:31:45,829
Rym: Oh, yeah Yeah to not get too far off topic It's real easy to get off topic when I don't have my little teleprompter in front of me telling me what to talk about.

444
00:31:47,451 --> 00:31:47,973
Rym: My I gotta.

445
00:31:48,053 --> 00:31:52,010
Rym: I got the monitor on like always but it's just a desktop with a picture of a tree.

446
00:31:53,032 --> 00:32:05,490
Scott: I think the real biggest inconvenience of not having internet is not a lack of entertainment Or the lack of the most powerful tool in your tools kit, you know when you want to do things even though those are pretty big.

447
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:09,207
Scott: It's the lack of access to information.

448
00:32:09,287 --> 00:32:12,257
Scott: It's as if Someone stole your encyclopedia set.

449
00:32:12,337 --> 00:32:12,879
Scott: Well, think of this.

450
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:16,132
Scott: you want to know shit all the time and now you know Nothing.

451
00:32:16,313 --> 00:32:16,775
Rym: scott's friend.

452
00:32:16,835 --> 00:32:17,518
Rym: Ian came over.

453
00:32:17,598 --> 00:32:18,342
Rym: We haven't seen him in a while.

454
00:32:18,362 --> 00:32:20,150
Rym: He's a good friend of ours and he's in the house.

455
00:32:20,291 --> 00:32:22,853
Rym: So we're like hey and we sit down and you know We have plenty to do.

456
00:32:22,873 --> 00:32:30,422
Rym: we played a bunch of smash brothers and some warioware went out to eat and played some board games Railroad tycoon, which alex won by a lot.

457
00:32:30,543 --> 00:32:32,270
Scott: Yeah, we were pretty much entertained all day.

458
00:32:32,511 --> 00:32:33,800
Scott: I never wanted for like.

459
00:32:33,981 --> 00:32:37,739
Scott: I guess I wanted for the internet But I didn't even really think about it because we're doing other shit.

460
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:44,103
Rym: in the span of like four and a half five hours With this friend over there were at least 20 or 30 moments where?

461
00:32:46,192 --> 00:32:49,907
Rym: Something we were about to do was foiled by the fact that we did not have internet access.

462
00:32:50,007 --> 00:32:50,730
Rym: little things like.

463
00:32:51,111 --> 00:33:01,750
Rym: We're talking about all the abandoned factories on the waterfront and he's really interested like oh, that sounds really cool to which I say Yeah, let me get on flickr and i'll show you the pictures.

464
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:04,480
Scott: We're like, hey, did you see that video with the?

465
00:33:04,781 --> 00:33:06,348
Scott: you can't you can't lift 10 pokemon here?

466
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:09,345
Scott: Let me show you this great video on youtube.

467
00:33:09,747 --> 00:33:13,842
Scott: Ah Borlax, yeah, and then you know, what else was it?

468
00:33:14,023 --> 00:33:15,890
Scott: It was like, oh he's talking about airsoft.

469
00:33:16,071 --> 00:33:19,847
Scott: So we're like, hey, let's go look up some the prices of airsoft guns in that website.

470
00:33:19,867 --> 00:33:20,812
Rym: You just mentioned You know what?

471
00:33:20,872 --> 00:33:23,002
Scott: It's probably delicious the website.

472
00:33:23,023 --> 00:33:25,072
Rym: You just told me about uh.

473
00:33:26,852 --> 00:33:29,541
Rym: And then we're talking like oh, yeah, we're gonna go to rochester for toricon.

474
00:33:29,581 --> 00:33:30,564
Rym: When is toricon?

475
00:33:30,825 --> 00:33:32,169
Rym: We have no way to find out.

476
00:33:32,571 --> 00:33:38,189
Scott: Yeah, I I think what it is is back in the day when the computer and the internet was less.

477
00:33:38,992 --> 00:33:43,670
Scott: I didn't rely on it as a you know as an external memory story.

478
00:33:43,952 --> 00:33:50,650
Scott: Oh just like in ghost in the shell just like in ghost in the shell now I don't remember a lot of things without the internet.

479
00:33:50,871 --> 00:34:02,669
Scott: I am a much dumber person in term not in terms of being able to figure things out or you know Knowledge potential but in terms of the facts stored in my brain are much less.

480
00:34:03,432 --> 00:34:08,230
Rym: At least 10 or 15 of the times we wanted the internet were simply we were having an not really an argument.

481
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:13,570
Rym: We were just talking about something and then the question comes up where we're not sure about one of the facts or like.

482
00:34:14,112 --> 00:34:18,210
Rym: I think that this building was for this and you think it was for that and we really don't know.

483
00:34:18,552 --> 00:34:23,356
Rym: Well, let's look it up on Wikipedia The only source of information anymore.

484
00:34:23,376 --> 00:34:23,917
Rym: Yeah.

485
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:24,217
Scott: Yeah.

486
00:34:24,478 --> 00:34:24,719
Scott: Yeah.

487
00:34:25,241 --> 00:34:28,850
Scott: It's like hey, you know, who was the guy who wrote that book?

488
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:29,331
Scott: I don't know.

489
00:34:29,371 --> 00:34:32,830
Rym: Let's go find out and we have no way to get any of this information.

490
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:35,482
Scott: It's not just stuff that we don't know yet that we need to look up.

491
00:34:35,522 --> 00:34:35,844
Scott: a lot of.

492
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:40,210
Scott: it's stuff that I did know But I just don't remember because I don't have to anymore.

493
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:50,710
Rym: But here's the interesting thing and I think it speaks a lot about how much the way we live has changed Just in the last decade when the internet went from nothing to everything.

494
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:56,349
Rym: Before the internet was like this people just wouldn't find out a lot of the things that we want to know.

495
00:34:56,811 --> 00:35:07,430
Rym: I mean if you're living somewhere and you want to know some semi-obscure fact about someone who was a general in world war ii Your option is if you really want to know go to the library.

496
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:14,862
Rym: You have to go to the library spend at least an hour researching because you're not just going to find the book that talks About this one guy immediately.

497
00:35:14,882 --> 00:35:16,330
Rym: You don't have to talk to the librarian.

498
00:35:16,892 --> 00:35:29,649
Scott: Yeah, there are some types of questions the library can answer very easily or that an encyclopedia Can answer very easily like or an almanac actually is really good for just answering questions Like what's the population of so-and-so?

499
00:35:30,412 --> 00:35:33,079
Scott: Uh, who was the famous guy in in this battle?

500
00:35:33,139 --> 00:35:35,586
Scott: who won this war, you know, when?

501
00:35:35,726 --> 00:35:37,170
Scott: what years did this take place?

502
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:41,024
Scott: History, you know, what's the name of this scientific reaction?

503
00:35:41,044 --> 00:35:41,124
Scott: What?

504
00:35:41,265 --> 00:35:42,530
Scott: or the process of it?

505
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:43,937
Scott: That's that's easy stuff to find.

506
00:35:43,977 --> 00:35:46,289
Scott: but like what was the name of the guy?

507
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:48,856
Scott: In that thingy there?

508
00:35:48,876 --> 00:35:51,164
Scott: or you know who directed that movie?

509
00:35:51,344 --> 00:35:52,789
Scott: Yeah who directed that movie?

510
00:35:52,889 --> 00:35:54,650
Scott: All right What else did he direct?

511
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:56,915
Scott: All right, who is the actor in that?

512
00:35:57,397 --> 00:36:00,067
Scott: without imdb that becomes a chore.

513
00:36:00,267 --> 00:36:06,509
Rym: but here's the thing That information was not readily available in our lifetime and we got on just fine without it.

514
00:36:07,031 --> 00:36:11,730
Rym: So our lives worked before we had this constant feed of information.

515
00:36:12,231 --> 00:36:18,970
Rym: Now that we are accustomed to this constant feed of information our lives slowly grind to a halt without that feed.

516
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:21,259
Rym: Hmm i'm not i'm not.

517
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,050
Rym: i really don't have anything where to go with that.

518
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:27,390
Rym: There's too many ramifications for me to really go into a lot of depth about it's true?

519
00:36:27,631 --> 00:36:27,952
Rym: Oh, i'm.

520
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:36,765
Rym: so i'm so dependent on this information now and while I can live without it Like I was saying before and I was a hermit for three months living in the mountains.

521
00:36:36,846 --> 00:36:42,810
Rym: No contact with anyone I would drive 20 minutes down the mountain to call my mom and talk for a half hour.

522
00:36:43,151 --> 00:36:51,118
Rym: But but during that time the only reason my life didn't collapse and I didn't just go nuts Was that one I knew it was temporary.

523
00:36:51,138 --> 00:36:54,670
Rym: like at the end of this time i'm moving somewhere else where I will have internet.

524
00:36:55,372 --> 00:36:57,930
Rym: And now if the internet was just down for a day or two, it'd be fine.

525
00:36:58,352 --> 00:37:00,463
Rym: But the fact that the internet is down indefinitely.

526
00:37:00,805 --> 00:37:04,670
Rym: each day that goes by I am more and more behind on what's going on in the world.

527
00:37:05,212 --> 00:37:09,870
Rym: And of course then again, I gotta wonder how much does me not knowing about what's going on in the world?

528
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:17,030
Rym: Immediately affect me as opposed to finding out two or three days later when I watch the news or read a newspaper at work?

529
00:37:18,011 --> 00:37:19,175
Scott: I I I just don't.

530
00:37:19,235 --> 00:37:26,839
Rym: am I really a better person for knowing that the president of jabootie Died of colon cancer five minutes ago.

531
00:37:26,859 --> 00:37:28,766
Rym: I don't think he actually did.

532
00:37:28,886 --> 00:37:29,247
Rym: i'm just.

533
00:37:29,588 --> 00:37:30,090
Rym: that was an example.

534
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:33,005
Scott: No, you're not because even when I have the internet I don't read those stories.

535
00:37:33,427 --> 00:37:33,909
Rym: Yeah, I do.

536
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:40,915
Scott: Yeah, it doesn't affect me not to know them just like it doesn't affect you not to know the stories I read about Computers and video games.

537
00:37:41,076 --> 00:37:41,317
Rym: Yeah.

538
00:37:41,337 --> 00:37:49,762
Rym: Yeah, but at the same time by getting all this information constantly I always feel like like knowing that x happened in jabootie doesn't really affect my life.

539
00:37:50,204 --> 00:38:01,567
Rym: and knowing that barack obama said this And that john mccain said this in american politics alone don't mean anything to me or whatever's going on in france's Government right now doesn't mean anything to me.

540
00:38:02,473 --> 00:38:15,210
Rym: But by getting all these bits of information constantly I feel like by knowing all of them All the time i'm able to form this broad picture of the world that I really would have no way of doing before the internet.

541
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:18,306
Rym: I don't know how it helps me, but I feel like it does.

542
00:38:18,427 --> 00:38:27,366
Rym: I feel like I am more aware of myself and my surroundings by having this vague cloud of information That is oftentimes relevant.

543
00:38:27,406 --> 00:38:41,565
Scott: surprisingly Well, I think if anything, you know without that cloud of information you start living not just in the present time But you live, you know A life only influenced by what's happening immediately around you.

544
00:38:41,625 --> 00:38:54,330
Scott: your perspective is very As far as your eyes can see and that's it, you know, like if you're a farmer and you work in a farm All you see is that farm and the town you work in and whatever.

545
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:58,426
Scott: Then the way you live your life is going to be based on that town.

546
00:38:58,507 --> 00:39:05,930
Scott: if you're farming You know is going to be affected by something far away or maybe your farming will affect something far away.

547
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:09,201
Scott: Or if there's going to be a competing farm in another state or something like that

548
00:39:09,342 --> 00:39:21,070
Rym: or like say you use this one technique of farming And people out on the internet have discovered that this technique actually destroys the soil And pollutes and is bad for the environment generally is a bad idea, but you won't know it right away.

549
00:39:21,733 --> 00:39:23,179
Rym: You won't find that out right away.

550
00:39:23,581 --> 00:39:25,549
Rym: So you wouldn't know that you're doing something bad.

551
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:31,069
Scott: Yep, it's it's having just an open eye to everything that's going on.

552
00:39:31,531 --> 00:39:36,410
Scott: It allows you if you are smart to make your life better in many ways.

553
00:39:36,731 --> 00:39:53,610
Rym: Well, I guess to me the way I it's hard to describe how I feel about this But if you've ever read watchmen You know when ozzymandias is standing there and he's looking at that wall of tv screen showing every television station in the world Like all the news all the commercials everything and he doesn't watch any individual channel.

554
00:39:53,851 --> 00:39:54,573
Rym: He never does.

555
00:39:54,854 --> 00:39:59,730
Rym: he walks into the room and kind of just has the thousand yard stare looking at the wall.

556
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:18,097
Rym: And by picking up all the bits and pieces from all these extraneous simultaneous real-time elements he's able to form this general understanding of like the zeitgeist of the world at that time or what's going on right now or The general direction of things to come.

557
00:40:18,419 --> 00:40:27,613
Rym: and that's how I feel the internet is affecting my life on a broad scale Because I feel like my scope is narrowing with each day that I don't have internet access Like I don't.

558
00:40:27,754 --> 00:40:29,823
Rym: there are events going on that I don't know about.

559
00:40:30,204 --> 00:40:40,075
Rym: so my extrapolations And my guesses and all those are becoming less and less likely to be accurate because i'm having to guess further and further out With less and less information.

560
00:40:40,236 --> 00:40:43,830
Scott: I definitely am having the fee the same feeling of narrowing going on.

561
00:40:43,971 --> 00:40:49,530
Scott: Even though I was able to go through my google reader today and delicious a bunch of things I actually stopped to read any of them.

562
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:53,130
Scott: I pretty much tagged them expecting the internet to work when I got home, but here's the other thing.

563
00:40:53,190 --> 00:41:02,110
Rym: I'm, not saying that this is bad necessarily Because one thing scott and I noticed was that we got a lot done without the internet to distract us.

564
00:41:02,291 --> 00:41:12,676
Scott: Yeah, well, I think if it's sort of like, you know, we don't have a dryer We only have a washing machine, right if we move somewhere else or we got a dryer suddenly That would help us out a lot.

565
00:41:13,077 --> 00:41:16,950
Scott: not having the internet is sort of like not having a dryer after having one.

566
00:41:17,371 --> 00:41:26,789
Scott: It's like it was so convenient and so great and our lives are so improved or at least they felt improved by Being able to dry our clothes in our house.

567
00:41:27,332 --> 00:41:29,950
Scott: And if we go back to not having it, well right now we don't have one.

568
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:32,279
Scott: We take our clothes to the laundromat and it still works.

569
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,848
Scott: We can still live and have clean clothes but not having it is just.

570
00:41:37,713 --> 00:41:44,270
Scott: It just feels so worse after having it as whereas if you've never had it Then it doesn't feel so bad not to have of course.

571
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:48,490
Rym: The other interesting thing is that without the internet we have almost no use for our computers.

572
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:56,102
Rym: So until just now when I started to do the show all weekend for the most part All of our computers were off and the house was so quiet.

573
00:41:56,162 --> 00:41:58,350
Rym: The house was startlingly quiet.

574
00:41:58,772 --> 00:41:59,656
Rym: It was unnerving.

575
00:41:59,697 --> 00:42:06,767
Rym: the first night I went to sleep I could hear Everything And I heard noises and I was afraid that they were something else.

576
00:42:06,807 --> 00:42:07,772
Scott: and I was like, okay What was that?

577
00:42:08,073 --> 00:42:12,609
Rym: I heard scott rolling around in his bed on the opposite side of the house.

578
00:42:13,391 --> 00:42:22,230
Scott: Normally all I hear when I go to bed is Occasionally did you yep, I hear computers just fans blowing constantly.

579
00:42:22,431 --> 00:42:25,770
Rym: No, as I was laying in bed, you don't realize how loud they are until you turn them all off.

580
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:28,117
Rym: I heard every single car drive by on the street.

581
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:28,980
Rym: I heard.

582
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:36,550
Scott: I heard the trees rustling in the wind outside my window When I was in the bathroom, I heard the train pull into the station far away.

583
00:42:36,731 --> 00:42:38,720
Rym: Yeah, the train station is like three miles away.

584
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:40,267
Scott: Yeah, and I heard the train go.

585
00:42:40,348 --> 00:42:44,262
Rym: dude Well, I hear that anyway, but that's because it's actually really loud.

586
00:42:44,282 --> 00:42:45,246
Scott: Well in my room.

587
00:42:45,286 --> 00:42:46,995
Scott: I don't hear it so much But yeah, it's pretty loud.

588
00:42:47,096 --> 00:42:49,370
Rym: Yeah, for some reason I hear it really loud in my room and I like it.

589
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:50,558
Rym: I actually like that sound at night.

590
00:42:51,122 --> 00:42:51,524
Scott: It's all right.

591
00:42:51,867 --> 00:42:52,249
Scott: I don't mind it.

592
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:54,199
Rym: It's a good sound to hear in the distance late at night.

593
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:56,330
Rym: a train whistling is, you know going off.

594
00:42:56,756 --> 00:42:57,690
Scott: Yeah, you know, it's not good.

595
00:42:57,771 --> 00:43:04,150
Scott: The subway is like I'm on the second floor in my building And the subway at that part of the city is like right under the street.

596
00:43:04,613 --> 00:43:07,249
Scott: So every like, you know a few minutes the office goes.

597
00:43:08,831 --> 00:43:09,453
Rym: Oh, it's not.

598
00:43:09,494 --> 00:43:10,237
Rym: it's like.

599
00:43:10,397 --> 00:43:13,349
Rym: it's like in blues brothers where they go to this apartment.

600
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:15,477
Scott: It's not that bad, but I do.

601
00:43:15,577 --> 00:43:19,050
Scott: I don't think anyone else notices it because it's not really as bad as blues brothers.

602
00:43:19,191 --> 00:43:19,856
Rym: You get used to it.

603
00:43:19,876 --> 00:43:21,770
Scott: But yeah, I I actually still notice it.

604
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:25,930
Scott: It's a little like a little bit of rumbliness and you can definitely tell the subways give it a month and you'll lose it.

605
00:43:26,092 --> 00:43:33,898
Rym: Remember I grew up with birds And to this day if i'm in a house and say someone has a bunch of birds or a bunch of dogs And the dogs just barking constantly.

606
00:43:33,918 --> 00:43:34,944
Rym: I don't even hear it.

607
00:43:35,064 --> 00:43:36,150
Rym: It doesn't even affect me at all.

608
00:43:36,271 --> 00:43:39,830
Rym: I could just sit in a room with dogs barking all day and it wouldn't even bother me.

609
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:41,677
Scott: Yeah, the thing is maybe like.

610
00:43:41,897 --> 00:43:45,832
Scott: I think part of the reason dogs barking like dogs barking alone That's like.

611
00:43:45,852 --> 00:43:46,998
Scott: the noise doesn't bother me.

612
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:54,750
Scott: But if a dog is like in the room with you barking There's a part of that bark noise that actually hurts a part of my ear and that's the part that bothers me.

613
00:43:55,711 --> 00:43:55,891
Scott: Like.

614
00:43:55,932 --> 00:44:01,190
Scott: really I think there's something like when a dog if a dog barks loudly scott, I think that's just your parents dog.

615
00:44:01,697 --> 00:44:02,670
Scott: No, there's other dogs.

616
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:10,394
Scott: They all pretty much any dog barking except for like a yap dog, but any real dog that barks like bark It hurts.

617
00:44:10,776 --> 00:44:11,017
Scott: It hurts.

618
00:44:11,037 --> 00:44:13,670
Scott: Well growling is not barking but it hurts my ear.

619
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:22,908
Scott: there's a part of the bark that hurts my ear like at the peak of it and I guess maybe if you keep hearing dogs bark eventually you won't be able to hear that anymore.

620
00:44:23,109 --> 00:44:23,510
Scott: It'll damage.

621
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:26,180
Rym: I don't know that I never had that problem as a kid.

622
00:44:26,441 --> 00:44:27,947
Scott: Maybe your ear was damaged early.

623
00:44:28,007 --> 00:44:28,289
Scott: I don't know.

624
00:44:29,432 --> 00:44:31,078
Rym: I think you're just weird whatever.

625
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:39,490
Rym: but I mean what I was saying before we got off on topic was just that On this one hot hand by not having the internet like this, you know, my my scope narrows.

626
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:49,183
Rym: But on the other hand it was pleasant to have an evening an evening where I never thought I should go upstairs and see what's happening in the world is.

627
00:44:49,223 --> 00:45:02,006
Rym: instead I couldn't so and I just I lived my life in the immediate present which and it was the first time i've done that in quite some time And it's almost to the point where we're thinking about maybe every friday evening.

628
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:03,130
Rym: We just won't use the internet.

629
00:45:03,391 --> 00:45:06,884
Scott: well, I think what it is is just I. I find myself.

630
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:15,269
Scott: I realize that I Do sit at the computer just you know when the as the default and I actually spend more time there than I think.

631
00:45:15,912 --> 00:45:31,289
Scott: Yeah, it's like i'll go when I get home and go to google reader And look at all the stories which takes pretty much almost the same amount of time Almost no matter how many stories are in there and they'll be like 30 new stories But i'll still spend like 20 minutes there clicking through them.

632
00:45:31,612 --> 00:45:34,656
Rym: Yep, or even when we were at rit I remember this half would happen often.

633
00:45:35,037 --> 00:45:43,330
Rym: if we're sitting at our computers for whatever reason and the internet's down We just keep making squares on the desktop with the selecty bit of the mouse.

634
00:45:43,711 --> 00:45:48,610
Scott: Yeah, it's not so much that you know using the computer is taking up a lot of my time.

635
00:45:49,071 --> 00:45:56,009
Scott: It's that i'm spending a lot of time just sitting at the computer not doing anything not even really Realizing that i'm wasting a whole bunch of time.

636
00:45:56,211 --> 00:46:05,562
Rym: Yeah, I mean when I first got access to the internet for that brief span of time at work this morning I used that time so efficiently it would make a german cry.

637
00:46:05,582 --> 00:46:10,317
Scott: Yeah, I I basically just have to Not keep like I go.

638
00:46:10,417 --> 00:46:18,324
Scott: i'll go and load up all the web comics even though i've already read them and it that I just wasting 10 minutes and maybe there'll be one new web comic.

639
00:46:18,384 --> 00:46:20,090
Rym: but you still look at all the rest of them.

640
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:24,285
Scott: Yeah Why am I wasting 10 minutes of my time when I could be doing something else?

641
00:46:24,325 --> 00:46:28,729
Scott: and while that's not a big deal On its own you add all those up over the course of a day.

642
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:40,170
Scott: I do that like five or six times or i'll scroll down dig yet again, even though there's only three new stories And I've now wasted like two hours that I could have used to do even more awesome stuff.

643
00:46:40,311 --> 00:46:53,746
Scott: And if you don't know, I mean look at us now We already are so efficient in our time usage even with using computers in a. you know in the way that I just described That we can make a podcast four nights a week where most people.

644
00:46:53,786 --> 00:46:54,590
Scott: that's insane.

645
00:46:55,031 --> 00:47:05,446
Scott: so if I can manage to not if i'm not use the computer for no reason and only Do what I need to do on it and nothing else and not waste time sitting at it doing nothing.

646
00:47:05,928 --> 00:47:08,490
Rym: Holy crap Yep, so i'm going to try to do that.

647
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:13,990
Rym: I'm very much going to pointedly not so much try to change my internet using habits, but observe them.

648
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:20,450
Rym: I'm going to keep an eye on how much time I spend on the internet versus how much I get done on the internet.

649
00:47:20,891 --> 00:47:28,262
Scott: I'm pretty much from now on if i'm doing something on a computer that's not you know work like for work I'm gonna pay attention to what i'm doing.

650
00:47:28,343 --> 00:47:28,926
Scott: I'm gonna say huh?

651
00:47:29,911 --> 00:47:32,590
Scott: Is this something I need to do right now or am I wasting my time?

652
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:36,081
Scott: You know, i'll make sure I only load up the web comics once a day.

653
00:47:36,522 --> 00:47:39,983
Scott: I'll make sure that I only you know I'll click on google reader.

654
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:49,709
Scott: I'll keep it open I'll look at the number and if there aren't over 100 things in there I won't even bother looking at it because what could possibly be so urgent that it's worth spending all that time, you know, I won't.

655
00:47:50,771 --> 00:47:55,410
Scott: I'll go through the videos on dig once a day at home on the tv where it's more entertaining.

656
00:47:55,932 --> 00:47:57,458
Scott: Now, of course get at him constantly.

657
00:47:57,538 --> 00:48:00,630
Rym: the uh, the real important factor is how long do you think that's gonna last?

658
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:04,122
Rym: The internet's gonna come back and after a week, we'll have forgotten all this.

659
00:48:04,142 --> 00:48:05,910
Rym: I'll just be sitting there looking at dave.

660
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:11,946
Scott: Well, I think part of the problem as soon as the internet comes back I'm gonna be spending a lot of time loading up this laptop, which always takes a lot of time.

661
00:48:12,027 --> 00:48:12,730
Rym: Yeah, but that's fun.

662
00:48:13,293 --> 00:48:14,301
Rym: It is that's a lot of fun.

663
00:48:14,381 --> 00:48:14,583
Scott: Yep.

664
00:48:14,905 --> 00:48:15,126
Scott: Yep.

665
00:48:15,167 --> 00:48:15,288
Scott: Yep.

666
00:48:16,133 --> 00:48:18,890
Rym: So yes, uh, welcome to all the new listeners and such.

667
00:48:19,251 --> 00:48:31,069
Rym: This is a slightly non-typical episode of GeekNights due to the fact that we all as you well are aware Do not have an internet connection And are thus powerless in the face of the onslaught of information that is going right past the house.

668
00:48:33,472 --> 00:48:36,269
Rym: We're probably not gonna have internet for much of the rest of this week.

669
00:48:36,732 --> 00:48:40,269
Rym: We're not sure what we're gonna do, but suffice to say the show must go on.
