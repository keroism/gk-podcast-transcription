1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:07,308
Rym: So, a while ago, Andrew, our friend has been reading a bunch of history books and I've been reading a bunch of history books and Scott is here.

2
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:09,929
Guest 0: Do you read Scott?

3
00:00:13,711 --> 00:00:19,468
Rym: But we sort of decided, like you were reading this book and a couple other people had mentioned this book recently, unrelatedly.

4
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:23,400
Rym: So I said, "Hey, why don't we do a podcast and we'll all read this book and we'll talk about

5
00:00:23,462 --> 00:00:23,504
Rym: it.".

6
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:32,250
Rym: And it wasn't really a super big priority until the election happened and now I feel like it's a little more relevant, a little more worried.

7
00:00:33,332 --> 00:00:36,570
Guest 0: I talked about it in August where I was like, "Oh, this is an interesting what-if.

8
00:00:36,811 --> 00:00:37,154
Guest 0: Let's do some

9
00:00:37,174 --> 00:00:38,023
Guest 0: hypotheticals.".

10
00:00:38,831 --> 00:00:45,387
Rym: Like I remember talking to some, even with Emily, I was like, "Well, it's similar except there's these four fundamental things that are different about

11
00:00:45,427 --> 00:00:45,769
Rym: America.".

12
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:48,508
Rym: Now it's like, "Well, there's two fundamental things that are still

13
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:48,850
Rym: different.".

14
00:00:50,471 --> 00:00:53,250
Guest 0: Yeah, I feel like we should say what the book is for those who don't know.

15
00:00:53,470 --> 00:01:02,210
Rym: So the book that we read, this is the GeekNights Politics Club, I guess, is The Coming of the Third Reich by Richard Evans, who was a pretty well-respected author, actually.

16
00:01:02,571 --> 00:01:03,487
Rym: I was looking into his biz.

17
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:11,390
Rym: And I highly recommend all of you out there read the book because I don't trust myself to say any of the German words anywhere in this.

18
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:14,350
Rym: The names of these political parties, it's the Steel Helmets.

19
00:01:14,834 --> 00:01:15,484
Rym: I don't even know.

20
00:01:16,593 --> 00:01:16,970
Rym: Freecore.

21
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:23,728
Rym: But seriously, if you're interested in this at all, read the book because the book's not that long.

22
00:01:23,933 --> 00:01:24,770
Rym: It's very detailed.

23
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:26,148
Rym: It's very good.

24
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:30,767
Rym: And it's half as long as you think it is because the entire second half of the book is just citations.

25
00:01:31,296 --> 00:01:31,748
Guest 0: I know, right?

26
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:32,990
Guest 0: Two-thirds, I guess.

27
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,406
Guest 1: I was like, "Man, I have so far to

28
00:01:35,467 --> 00:01:35,689
Guest 1: go."

29
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:38,330
Guest 1: And then there was like 100 pages of citations.

30
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:45,550
Guest 0: So I guess this is actually one of three in Evans' discussion on Nazi Germany.

31
00:01:45,770 --> 00:02:02,449
Guest 0: So this focus is mostly on the intellectual background and the history of, I guess, where the state of German was from sort of the coalesce of all these sort of HRE states into a single nation state.

32
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:10,228
Rym: It gives this very nice sort of history of like, here's where the, I guess, zeitgeist of Germanic culture sort of arose.

33
00:02:11,251 --> 00:02:15,729
Rym: And then here's where it stood at the beginning of the end of World War I.

34
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:29,109
Guest 1: I feel like this area of their history is actually way more interesting because it's way more interesting on how a society falls apart to become this Nazi regime.

35
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:35,529
Rym: Especially considering that it was arguably the most progressive and enlightened society of the day.

36
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:40,990
Rym: It had become this shining beacon of a representative democracy to a degree.

37
00:02:41,351 --> 00:03:01,644
Guest 0: It's interesting how the seeds of a lot of what Nazism was based upon were laid down in these sort of semi-factual myths and sort of deification of people like Bismarck and kind of how that was eroded and twisted throughout the Great War up until the '30s.

38
00:03:04,911 --> 00:03:14,750
Guest 0: This is like one of the first books or sources where they don't start at the end of World War I. They start in the formation of Germany and really this quote unquote second Reich.

39
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:34,671
Rym: Which is interesting because I realized, thinking about my studies in high school social studies, which is the last time I studied any of this formally, very few people study this even in university, is it goes right up through Bismarck and then it just kind of skips to World War I. And then there's like one paragraph on the interwar period and then bam, 1939.

40
00:03:34,671 --> 00:03:47,565
Guest 1: I feel like this is like one of the original cases of a group of people trying to impose a democracy on a group of people that were not a democracy and didn't really feel that interested in it.

41
00:03:47,930 --> 00:04:00,788
Rym: But at the same time, it is very arguable because one of the themes of the book seems to be that everyone had held the democracy in contempt except for like the slightly left social democrats.

42
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:03,349
Rym: Like they were the ones who were like, guys, let's do this.

43
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:12,366
Rym: And everyone else in the entire country felt that democracy was failing them either because it wasn't going left enough or it wasn't going right enough or wasn't doing enough or it was doing too much.

44
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:18,010
Rym: So that sort of this contempt was just built into German popular culture.

45
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,235
Rym: And then it so I guess.

46
00:04:19,296 --> 00:04:23,890
Rym: I guess that contempt was always there and it just needed the conditions to be right for it to flare up fatally.

47
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:41,150
Guest 0: It wasn't just a contempt for democracy per se, but it was also to kind of go back to my previous point, this defecation of kind of the Prussian junker way of life, the upholding and defecation of the military and the role the military played in the government.

48
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:57,389
Guest 0: Because the big the big story you get out of the end of World War One was one, the sort of great lie and November traitors, whatever that the generals who lost the war put forward and supported to save face.

49
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:13,867
Guest 0: And then also the this kind of failure of the the new republic to support these veterans and all this military structure and really kind of transition them away from that type of way of life.

50
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:27,248
Rym: Well, there's where I was talking about the difference between not to get into comparing this to the United States, like so early in this talk, but a big difference that really stood out is that that stage was set partly by the fact that the war ended and Germany had lost.

51
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:39,270
Rym: And you had this mass conscripted society, like all these soldiers who suddenly just had to walk away from that and go back to what was left of their country and try to live their lives.

52
00:05:39,331 --> 00:05:40,649
Rym: And they were sort of aimless.

53
00:05:40,992 --> 00:05:44,150
Rym: And then in that environment, there were all these uprisings.

54
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:56,750
Rym: So they sort of just formed these militias and real militias, not like American sort of like tactical in the woods militias, but like for real, like paramilitary organizations that persisted all the way up to the Nazis.

55
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:56,944
Rym: Yeah.

56
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:00,550
Guest 1: Well, that's one of the things I don't think it's really their republic's fault.

57
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:04,729
Guest 1: I mean, these were rules put upon them when they lost the war.

58
00:06:05,411 --> 00:06:14,761
Guest 1: So the republic was like doomed to fail under the restrictions that the the allied forces, you know, like the other European forces inflicted upon them.

59
00:06:14,801 --> 00:06:16,226
Guest 1: like they they couldn't.

60
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:19,062
Guest 1: they could only have an army of so so big.

61
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:31,942
Guest 1: So it was almost encouraged to keep like, you know, these militias running with each political party, because they wanted to have an army, but they couldn't officially have one.

62
00:06:33,213 --> 00:06:35,690
Guest 0: And I think but but it's also more than that, right?

63
00:06:36,131 --> 00:06:51,010
Guest 0: It's it's the fact that the Great War, we're looking at millions of troops, and then to demilitarize that and just say, tough luck, and then also impose economic sanctions, and say, Hey, we need payments for you to build the rest of our cities.

64
00:06:51,531 --> 00:06:58,350
Guest 0: Oh, and France is going to invade and occupy some of your territory, because fuck you, some of your most industrially productive territory.

65
00:06:58,931 --> 00:07:11,630
Guest 0: Yeah, yeah, it's, it's, it's almost this trifecta of the allies, or I guess, the, the, the triple entente as it was kind of crippling them beyond, I guess, a justified way.

66
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:16,210
Guest 0: Because there was no ethical right or wrong in the Great War, right?

67
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:18,196
Guest 0: It was it was just war.

68
00:07:18,276 --> 00:07:31,190
Guest 0: for war's sake, everyone kind of living this pre 19th century, 18th century idea of, oh, Germany will have a European states will have a fight and be gentlemen and, and kind of get on with our political lives.

69
00:07:31,294 --> 00:07:31,470
Guest 0: Great.

70
00:07:31,773 --> 00:07:32,490
Guest 0: Oh, this is my son.

71
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,590
Guest 0: He came back from the war, he's gonna be the next game, whatever.

72
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:51,429
Rym: Of course, there is a counterpoint to that a very powerful one, at least that all the evidence from inside of Germany and sort of, you know, before the war went south in the opposite direction that had Germany won the war, the exact opposite situation would have occurred, or at least that is what they believed would occur.

73
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:56,930
Rym: Like they, it is not like if Germany had won, they would have been the gracious benefactors of Europe.

74
00:07:57,451 --> 00:08:13,090
Rym: So it's, and especially because it's easy to see, you know, there are a lot of causes to the war, but Germany was sort of specifically guilty of continuing the war far beyond when it needed to go and was widely seen as the aggressor that drove it to a world conflict.

75
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:13,850
Guest 0: Oh, for sure.

76
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:14,828
Guest 0: They were the aggressor.

77
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:25,730
Guest 0: I mean, you look at like the Schlieffen plan and the fact that their entire military government system was structured around a state of expansion, right?

78
00:08:26,151 --> 00:08:28,069
Guest 0: They wanted any excuse they could take.

79
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:36,950
Guest 0: They, they deliberately escalated, you know, the assassination of Franz Ferdinand in order to enact the Schlieffen plan and take over France.

80
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:46,408
Rym: Which was an echo of how Germany formed in the first place with the Franco-Prussian war, where they basically just bothered France until France declared war in the old European way.

81
00:08:46,851 --> 00:08:56,290
Rym: From the perspective of the Europeans, like, you know, the winners of World War One, it's very easy to see, like just from where they were standing, why they did what they did.

82
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,530
Rym: They saw Germany as a threat.

83
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:01,550
Rym: Germany still had this sort of massive economy despite the sanctions.

84
00:09:02,332 --> 00:09:11,829
Rym: And there's a separate narrative in this book that I didn't really think about where it talks about how the sanctions really crippled Germany and basically made it impossible for the Weimar Republic to succeed.

85
00:09:12,971 --> 00:09:26,330
Rym: But at the same time, it succeeded pretty well in spite of that and appeared to be on this sort of very clear long-term sort of recovery trajectory that almost got hijacked by the Nazi movement.

86
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:38,990
Guest 0: Well, yeah, there is, there's the fact that the Great Depression happened and other like massive inflation occurring in Germany throughout the 20s, even before the Great Depression.

87
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:48,310
Rym: But yet the Nazis didn't come to serious power then when they really had their rapid rise to power was like after things were actually getting better in Germany.

88
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:58,029
Guest 0: But even then, right, during out through that whole period, all these troops, all these sort of this, this national, and this is the big thing I learned is that the Nazis were just one of many.

89
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:07,363
Guest 0: They're just the one that succeeded, you know, whether or not you want to attribute that to the great man theory that like Hitler was somehow uniquely, you know, how do you need him?

90
00:10:10,612 --> 00:10:13,210
Rym: Well, they always use the word mesmerizing, like he mesmerized us.

91
00:10:13,511 --> 00:10:23,770
Rym: But remember in this book, there's that sort of pre Hitler, I forget the guy's name, but there was the dude who was basically doing the same things Hitler was doing earlier and just like didn't get traction.

92
00:10:23,951 --> 00:10:27,026
Rym: And it's almost like a life of Brian situation where there kept being these people.

93
00:10:27,508 --> 00:10:31,870
Rym: like that movement was always there for as long as modern Germany existed.

94
00:10:33,031 --> 00:10:42,789
Rym: Like that 10 to 30% of the population was like they're sort of seething and ready and just the conditions weren't right for them to really flare up.

95
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:51,150
Rym: Like Hitler, I don't know if Hitler would have succeeded if his whole story somehow started was shifted 10 years to the left or 10 years to the right.

96
00:10:51,633 --> 00:10:54,310
Rym: But a different person might've risen up at that exact same time.

97
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:54,661
Guest 0: Yeah.

98
00:10:55,111 --> 00:11:08,528
Guest 0: And so that's why, like the fact that the Nazis came to power after things are getting better I think is a bit disingenuous because you miss all the groundwork that was laid throughout those formative, you know, post war years that gave rise to him.

99
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:24,370
Guest 0: You notice the fact that even the social Democrats and the centrists didn't really believe in the Republic and took every chance they could to sort of slightly twist and, and, and prevent the Republic from functioning, that undermine it in very specific ways.

100
00:11:26,172 --> 00:11:29,950
Guest 0: The judicial system was completely full of nationalists.

101
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:43,849
Guest 0: They were, they were essentially officers of the military where, you know, anytime like, you know, people like Hitler or nationalists go to go to jail, they were essentially just set free because they were so nationalist and anti-communist.

102
00:11:44,610 --> 00:12:01,266
Rym: I guess it just, it speaks to the strength of the social Democrats and just the democracy as a whole, that despite every level of its structure, basically being against it, like that party was still largely in power and was able to push its agenda.

103
00:12:01,768 --> 00:12:02,470
Rym: in spite of that.

104
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:16,890
Rym: And even until the end, the Nazis never really got more than 30, 40% of the vote, despite open naked suppression and despite like the courts and the police and the military and everyone basically formally cracking down, like they still couldn't get the votes.

105
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:17,330
Guest 0: Yeah.

106
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:25,110
Guest 1: I think the mistake that occurred that really hurt the social Democrats was the rise of the communist movement.

107
00:12:25,831 --> 00:12:34,450
Guest 1: The left was fractured and then the far, I mean the, well, the Russian controlled communists were, were vilified.

108
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:35,007
Rym: It did.

109
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:40,170
Rym: So I was sort of reminded of the fact that, you know, Comintern was actually a thing.

110
00:12:41,091 --> 00:12:46,930
Rym: Like in that era, like there was an open communist, like internationally coordinated organization.

111
00:12:47,794 --> 00:12:54,250
Guest 0: In the book itself, if you let me open it up, I'm pretty sure one of the pictures shows an alleyway just full of Russian flags and communists.

112
00:12:54,864 --> 00:12:54,990
Guest 0: Yeah.

113
00:12:55,151 --> 00:13:02,350
Guest 0: It's right here on a, I don't know, it's number 16, but it's just, you don't see any, like you wouldn't imagine that would be post post world war one, Germany, right?

114
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:04,969
Guest 0: You just see an alley full of, you know, sickle and hammers.

115
00:13:05,614 --> 00:13:06,709
Guest 0: But it was a real threat.

116
00:13:07,392 --> 00:13:10,950
Rym: Well, even if it was, you know, despite the threat, it was also a very popular movement.

117
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:12,650
Rym: Like the communist party wasn't small.

118
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:13,365
Guest 0: Yeah, no.

119
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:13,681
Guest 0: Yeah.

120
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:17,770
Guest 0: But there was, there's, you know, people wanting, there were like, you know, communists.

121
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:18,427
Rym: Yeah.

122
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,196
Guest 1: I mean that the problem there was.

123
00:13:20,256 --> 00:13:25,389
Guest 1: you had the, the left was literally at war with itself with an extreme version of itself.

124
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:37,450
Guest 1: Meanwhile, the Nazis stayed away from the groups that tended to be closer to their ideology, like the nationalists and the steel helmets.

125
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:53,809
Rym: But they also did something very specific and I noticed this throughout the book whenever like when they were there, they would reach out to the steel helmets and like try to get them in on a particular coalition or in a particular deal or they reach out to the trade unions when they were still parties because they seem to collapse pretty quick in this whole story.

126
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:59,969
Rym: But they basically told every one of those people a completely different story of what their party was about.

127
00:14:00,552 --> 00:14:01,469
Rym: And it worked.

128
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:10,348
Guest 1: It was funny to look at when the, the national socialists actually had a little bit of socialist message and then they like immediately dropped it.

129
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:10,782
Rym: Yep.

130
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:11,688
Rym: It wasn't immediate.

131
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,850
Guest 0: It was, it was after the beer hall pushed.

132
00:14:14,038 --> 00:14:14,270
Guest 0: Right.

133
00:14:14,651 --> 00:14:21,870
Guest 0: And, and Hitler realized that one, you couldn't just like take control of power with the police and the military, even though he didn't have the military on his side.

134
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:28,289
Guest 0: But he began to realize that if it was going to succeed, he had to take control of the party itself.

135
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:42,070
Guest 0: You know, they codify those rules that says Hitler is the one and only leader of the party, but that didn't really happen until they spread out into Northern Germany and the parts where they, they didn't have sort of the same nationalist been right.

136
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:54,770
Guest 0: You have to remember Northern Germany was much more socialist leaning and that's why they had to have the socialist part of the Nazi, you know, there was two parties at that point almost that were like loosely alive.

137
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:54,877
Guest 1: Yeah.

138
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:57,010
Rym: You see this very clever strategy.

139
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:11,350
Rym: I mean, I don't know if it was clever in hindsight or if it was a stated strategy, but they would sort of let the socialist wing of the party do its own thing in the regions where that was popular, but ignore that in their actual sort of longterm national strategy.

140
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:11,746
Guest 0: Oh yeah.

141
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:12,244
Guest 0: Oh yeah.

142
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:18,110
Rym: And they'd literally go to like, they'd even like, they'd reach out to the communists and say, look, the democracy is failing both of us.

143
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:23,227
Rym: Like they would literally work with anyone who would talk to them and say whatever they had to say.

144
00:15:24,911 --> 00:15:34,050
Rym: And I think that, I mean, it's interesting cause they only got away with that specifically because this was an era when you couldn't necessarily catch them.

145
00:15:34,532 --> 00:15:41,550
Rym: It would be very difficult to find out they had these different messages because these political camps were entirely separate from each other.

146
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:42,710
Rym: They had armed militias.

147
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,570
Rym: They were basically at war in the streets.

148
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:49,170
Guest 1: And that's one area that's like really hard to think about in modern time.

149
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:58,430
Guest 1: Like, you know, we have protests and riots, but we don't really have like two armed political factions like attacking each other.

150
00:15:58,611 --> 00:16:00,090
Guest 0: There's no street brawls going on, right?

151
00:16:00,673 --> 00:16:02,450
Guest 0: There's no people just out on the hunt.

152
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:18,830
Guest 0: And like they, they talked about how the, uh, the essay very early on was used to deliberately go and break up, you know, meetings of other nationalist groups, you know, they'd go in surround the hall and just, you know, slowly creep in and beat people with clubs.

153
00:16:19,591 --> 00:16:23,730
Guest 0: It's like, and this is early on, this is like in the twenties and it wasn't just them.

154
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:36,529
Rym: I mean the communists had their gangs, there was basically street fighting almost every day and it was almost a footnote in the book, but there were multiple like municipal uprisings during this period that these paramilitaries would sort of just put down on their own.

155
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:39,767
Guest 0: Well the first one that kind of justified the nationalists is right.

156
00:16:39,807 --> 00:16:53,522
Guest 0: after world war one, when the Bolsheviks really started taking control, the new Republic was extremely worried that they would lose to this revolution and they allied themselves with the nationalists and the free Corps to put down that Bolshevik rebellion.

157
00:16:53,863 --> 00:16:59,090
Guest 0: and it kind of justified the existence of those militia groups throughout the twenties, right?

158
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:05,390
Guest 0: So once you justify them once and say, hey, we needed your help to put down the Bolsheviks, they're not going to go away, right?

159
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:12,430
Guest 0: They're now codified as part of like this extra government group because especially there's also no military.

160
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:16,050
Rym: And you see the government periodically starting to crack down on them more and more.

161
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,489
Rym: Like how many times were they disarmed?

162
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:23,609
Rym: But then one thing would lead to another and they would end up basically giving their weapons back because they needed them for something.

163
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:24,291
Guest 1: Yeah, I couldn't help.

164
00:17:24,372 --> 00:17:34,810
Guest 1: like when the one, like one of the times like Hitler gets arrested and I was just like, man, they could have ended it like they could have probably dealt with this problem like right then.

165
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:38,130
Rym: As you saw, the judges, the courts, the judges were sort of, were very sympathetic.

166
00:17:38,471 --> 00:17:46,450
Rym: So when all the Hitlers would get arrested, they would serve a token sentence and then be let out, excused for the fact that they were driven by passion and patriotism.

167
00:17:46,911 --> 00:17:50,870
Rym: And meanwhile, when the communist mob did something similar, they just get shot.

168
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:54,110
Guest 1: Yeah, that, I mean, that was, that was one of our questions, right?

169
00:17:54,392 --> 00:17:55,870
Guest 1: The, uh, like what didn't we know?

170
00:17:56,051 --> 00:18:00,890
Guest 1: I didn't realize how much bureaucratically the system was against itself.

171
00:18:01,771 --> 00:18:06,110
Guest 1: Like, you know, like you were saying, the judges weren't really interested in democracy.

172
00:18:06,373 --> 00:18:07,607
Guest 1: They looked down upon it.

173
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:11,749
Guest 1: They were like hoping for a return to the, Oh yeah, well like the bureaucracy too.

174
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:22,910
Rym: Like when the, when the Nazis started to come to power, the bureaucrats who had spines all resigned, assuming that that would mean something, which just let the Nazis fill in their posts and sort of consolidate their power.

175
00:18:23,272 --> 00:18:26,830
Rym: But the other half of the bureaucracy was kind of sympathetic.

176
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:28,230
Rym: Like they were ready and willing to work with.

177
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:34,449
Guest 0: A lot of people wanted to see the return of the Kaiser and not, not just the bureaucrats and not just the judicial system.

178
00:18:35,110 --> 00:19:05,968
Guest 0: Um, but the entire military really from the get go of the world war one, one distance itself away from the government, made sure it wasn't under control of the government and really it was this sort of independent power waiting and sort of, you know, one working with the judges to get the, the free core and, and all these ex soldiers out of the line, um, making deals with like social Democrats when they can in order to bypass certain, uh, limitations of like the Versailles treaty and the military restrictions.

179
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:16,890
Rym: Which in a way was a very much sort of the fatal, one of like, I don't want to say the fatal flaw because there's like 400 of them, but that was at the social Democrats, even them, the like stewards of democracy.

180
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:19,010
Guest 0: They wanted to see the return of the Kaiser.

181
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:19,421
Guest 0: Yeah.

182
00:19:19,631 --> 00:19:20,970
Rym: Like they would make these compromises.

183
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:25,770
Rym: They would compromise with all the people who literally would outlaw them if they ever had a majority.

184
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:41,370
Rym: So I guess the thing that I didn't know, and it's sort of very prescient to today, not to compare too much, but I didn't realize how politically sort of knowledgeable and savvy and active the German population was during the early days of the Weimar Republic.

185
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:49,492
Rym: Like the proliferation of newspapers, the fact that this was daily discussion, like everyone was involved in politics and everyone was very passionate about politics.

186
00:19:49,513 --> 00:19:58,449
Rym: And there was, there were political clubs and this constant sort of debate, but what seems to have changed, I highlighted it in the book, but he brings this up like four or five times.

187
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:10,505
Rym: I think it was in 1920, 1921, all the sort of legitimate political press got replaced by these sort of street printed dailies full of just bullshit, just literal lies.

188
00:20:11,992 --> 00:20:13,090
Guest 1: Wait, Facebook and Twitter?

189
00:20:15,252 --> 00:20:30,990
Rym: But like, that's the most terrifying thing that, I mean, the percentage of individual people who knew a lot about the politics of their democratic government in an era before modern communication technology were passionate, voted, and yet still like form these functioning governments.

190
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:37,010
Rym: And then that all seems to have eroded pretty rapidly once the professional press broke down.

191
00:20:37,392 --> 00:20:39,670
Guest 1: Well, that, I mean, that's like one of the big areas.

192
00:20:40,371 --> 00:20:46,607
Guest 1: The national institutions were not able to, were not strong enough to withstand what was going on.

193
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:47,359
Rym: Yeah.

194
00:20:47,792 --> 00:20:50,690
Guest 0: They weren't strong enough and no one believed in them anyways.

195
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,890
Guest 0: And that's the real failure, right?

196
00:20:53,070 --> 00:21:02,649
Guest 0: Is that no matter how you sort of structure your government or how many checks and balances you have, if the people don't want it to exist, it won't.

197
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,229
Guest 0: And everyone is saying, oh, it'll be good in our hands.

198
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,090
Guest 0: You know, the social Democrats, when we're in power, yeah, it's okay.

199
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:13,850
Guest 0: We'll erode all these restrictions on power because we'll do it for good.

200
00:21:14,351 --> 00:21:20,749
Guest 0: And then eventually someone comes to power and just takes it completely the other way.

201
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,690
Guest 0: And there's nothing you can do about it, unfortunately.

202
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:28,705
Rym: And I guess in history, like you sort of, like, I remember just being taught that the Nazis suddenly came to power and it's 1939 and it's war.

203
00:21:30,192 --> 00:21:31,109
Rym: And they kind of did.

204
00:21:31,511 --> 00:21:41,490
Rym: But after this, like three decades of simmering to like set everything up until eventually all the pieces were in place, because the final coming to power was him becoming chancellor.

205
00:21:41,611 --> 00:21:44,190
Rym: And then it was just, they needed one excuse and it was over.

206
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:47,130
Rym: But it took so long to get to that point.

207
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:52,409
Guest 1: Like the last half of this book is just like at this election, they had this percentage of the vote.

208
00:21:52,551 --> 00:21:55,130
Guest 1: Then this election was this percentage of the vote.

209
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,249
Rym: I'm scrolling through those now.

210
00:21:56,390 --> 00:22:02,594
Rym: And yeah, even in the last elections in 1933, the social Democrats still got 120 seats.

211
00:22:03,951 --> 00:22:10,250
Rym: Like they were still the second largest party by far, despite the fact that you would basically be attacked in the street.

212
00:22:10,391 --> 00:22:12,070
Rym: If anyone thought you were going to vote for them.

213
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:12,709
Guest 1: I know, right?

214
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:18,267
Guest 1: If you ran, if you ran as a social Democrat, you were pretty much like beating the crap out of.

215
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:32,250
Guest 0: Yeah, but it was the, it was the centrists that wanted, they eventually voted with the nationalist block to bring Hitler to power because they wanted to preserve the Catholic church and a bunch of protections for themselves.

216
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:32,450
Guest 0: Right.

217
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:34,685
Guest 0: It was very much a fuck.

218
00:22:34,706 --> 00:22:35,330
Guest 0: you got mine.

219
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:36,470
Guest 0: Fuck you get mine attitude.

220
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:37,590
Rym: Well, they were the swing state.

221
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:42,609
Rym: They were, they were the biggest party that wasn't specifically allied with the left or the right.

222
00:22:43,271 --> 00:22:50,350
Rym: So whoever made a coalition with them had a majority government and had the reins of this basically unchecked government.

223
00:22:51,011 --> 00:22:58,668
Rym: And the book goes into a lot about how radio and sexual liberation and like modern art and all these things were basically terrifying.

224
00:22:58,788 --> 00:23:06,189
Rym: all the conservatives, like the regular old stodgy conservatives who ended up in the center party, either because of religion or land ownership or whatever.

225
00:23:07,013 --> 00:23:14,350
Rym: And it seems like they were voting against modernity and they didn't really care about any of the other things that came along with that.

226
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:20,350
Rym: Like they would form a coalition with anyone who would oppose the sexual liberation and these changes that were frightening them.

227
00:23:20,633 --> 00:23:21,549
Guest 0: I think it's not just that.

228
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:27,688
Guest 0: And I'm, I'm a little hazy on this, but I remember that they, they almost formed a democratic society prior to world war one.

229
00:23:28,351 --> 00:23:35,342
Guest 0: And this is early on in the book and they go into sort of the root histories of the social Democrats and the center Catholics.

230
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:39,358
Guest 0: and why they hate each other is because of those reasons.

231
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:54,530
Guest 0: they fought each other in the Bismarck era, or I guess just after when they tried to bring the Republic out and the, and the centrist essentially voted against the social Democrats and said, fuck you against forming the Republic because of, you know, these.

232
00:23:55,052 --> 00:24:03,350
Guest 0: one, I think it was like, it was a communist reasons, maybe not, you know, and then also because of these, this social reasons, like you said.

233
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:12,450
Rym: Well, the book goes a lot just into that a lot, how the Nazis sort of used radio and use sort of the new media much more effectively early on.

234
00:24:13,571 --> 00:24:20,330
Rym: And at the same time, those technologies were sort of some of the symbols that the conservatives were actually sort of fighting against.

235
00:24:20,471 --> 00:24:23,330
Rym: So they seem to not embrace and use these modern methods.

236
00:24:23,792 --> 00:24:29,970
Guest 1: And then on top of all that, there was the antisemitism that slowly inched through all of society.

237
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:45,730
Rym: It is terrifying though, reading all the primary sources where like one, I mean, there were Jews who were members of these parties in the early days and everyone sort of wrote off the antisemitism as this sort of like expected part of politics, like, Oh yeah.

238
00:24:45,831 --> 00:24:48,950
Rym: And the Jews like, that's just, we're not serious about it.

239
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:51,530
Rym: We wouldn't do anything about it, but that is something.

240
00:24:52,331 --> 00:24:56,530
Guest 1: They're not actually going to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants.

241
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:00,729
Rym: Well, if they'd have deported undocumented immigrants, they would have deported Hitler.

242
00:25:04,352 --> 00:25:10,549
Rym: But like there's all these newspaper articles, not just in the book, but that I've just been reading recently for some reason.

243
00:25:11,271 --> 00:25:23,110
Rym: Like there was a Time magazine article from America talking about how Hitler's antisemitism is obviously just a call to these, like these unreachable people to bring them into a coalition of government, but that it's not serious.

244
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:26,530
Rym: And he's using it as a tool to sort of enlighten these masses.

245
00:25:27,631 --> 00:25:35,835
Rym: And you see that throughout and it sort of comes from, I think, and the book brings it up two times that the Nazis and the conservatives differed in that.

246
00:25:35,855 --> 00:25:50,769
Rym: the conservatives seem to just be very nationalist because Germany was a nation, even though like it was very culturally homogenous in a lot of ways, it was comprised of very different backgrounds because it wasn't a unified country until relatively recently, like in living memory in this book.

247
00:25:51,992 --> 00:25:56,290
Rym: And the Nazis turned nationalism into also having a race component.

248
00:25:56,732 --> 00:26:05,069
Rym: So a lot of people who were otherwise very sympathetic to the conservatives and to the Nazis ended up getting sort of sidelined because their ancestry wasn't correct.

249
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:23,242
Guest 0: But it's interesting how a lot of those tones, like the white nationalism, Aryan superiority, the antisemitism came from not German authors or Slavic authors, but people in England, America, and even, I think, Russia.

250
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:32,290
Guest 0: If you early on, they talk about all these different primary sources of so-and-so wrote this book and then they wrote this book and they're all English authors.

251
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:37,290
Guest 0: And so it's really not something you can be like, oh, this is like a pure German superiority thing.

252
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:43,630
Guest 0: It's like, no, it was co-opted by sort of people external looking at the German state who are like, oh, wow, look at all those Germans.

253
00:26:43,891 --> 00:26:45,903
Guest 0: That's what would be so great.

254
00:26:45,944 --> 00:26:50,270
Guest 0: if white people get together, they can form Germany and Germany begins to believe those lies themselves.

255
00:26:51,171 --> 00:26:52,669
Guest 0: And then the Nazis use that as leverage.

256
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:56,230
Rym: You know, that happened in another realm too, because it's very clear.

257
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:58,070
Rym: This is something I didn't really know too much.

258
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:02,305
Rym: Like I didn't really know about the Italian history up until actual World War II.

259
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:11,389
Rym: Like that, I don't think that's covered in a lot of American schools, but Mussolini came to power with the fascist revolution way earlier than I sort of just had in my head.

260
00:27:11,792 --> 00:27:19,190
Rym: And it was interesting seeing how Hitler and the NDA SP were seemed to be very specifically inspired by Mussolini and by the fascists.

261
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:23,497
Rym: And they sort of copied and mirrored them as openly and nakedly as they could.

262
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,050
Rym: So, yeah, I guess you're right.

263
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:28,012
Rym: These, a lot of the things that happened in Germany, like Germany was the place.

264
00:27:28,052 --> 00:27:33,549
Rym: all these ideas coalesced and gave rise to the horrors, but none of them really originated there.

265
00:27:34,133 --> 00:27:35,190
Guest 0: It is not a unique thing.

266
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:40,749
Guest 0: I mean, and this kind of goes, fascism wasn't vogue in the thirties and then twenties.

267
00:27:41,111 --> 00:27:51,330
Rym: I mean, the Americans had a pretty vibrant sort of Nazi nationalist movement that only really disappeared, or at least went underground when the war started.

268
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:56,911
Guest 1: I mean, at the same time, you also had communism that was rising at that time.

269
00:27:56,931 --> 00:28:01,090
Guest 1: at the same, you know, so it was like a war of these like extreme ideologies.

270
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:06,030
Rym: I just, one of the saddest parts of the book, you know, thinking about like, what was there a point of no return?

271
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:22,269
Rym: Because there's a point toward the end when things are getting really sour, but I forget exactly when it occurred, but the social Democrats had a chance to basically form up with the communists and resort to street violence and the social Democrats at no point would be willing to do that.

272
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:36,030
Rym: Like they had such faith in the democracy and the institutions that they had spent so long undermining that they continued even after the Nazis had complete power, filing lawsuits and trying to sort of take this very like democratic high road.

273
00:28:36,552 --> 00:28:47,570
Rym: When I think there's an implication that if they had resorted to street violence and revolution alongside the communists at key points along the way, the rise of Nazi Germany might not have occurred.

274
00:28:48,070 --> 00:29:04,562
Guest 1: At the same time though, the communists weren't really willing to work with them in any way because they had in the, well, they had other areas where they were trying to go forward that they didn't agree with the social Democrats and on top, and they'd been betrayed in the past by them.

275
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:05,010
Guest 1: True.

276
00:29:05,372 --> 00:29:05,810
Guest 1: Like politically.

277
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:12,670
Rym: They also had the idea that if the democracy finally collapsed, they could begin a true revolution.

278
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:15,010
Rym: So they kind of needed it to collapse.

279
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:18,302
Guest 1: It's like those people that just wanted to punch the government in the face.

280
00:29:19,517 --> 00:29:20,070
Rym: What's that comic?

281
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:22,210
Rym: I want things to be different smashes everything.

282
00:29:22,674 --> 00:29:23,765
Guest 0: I want change smash.

283
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:40,949
Guest 0: So the other thing that surprised me and I don't think it's been talked about was the effect that I was surprised by how strong youth movements were important in Germany and how much they really influenced political thought in the day.

284
00:29:43,419 --> 00:29:44,210
Guest 0: It wasn't just the Nazis.

285
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,941
Rym: You think not every political party.

286
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:47,295
Guest 0: Yeah.

287
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:48,869
Guest 0: Everyone hears about like the Hitler youth.

288
00:29:49,391 --> 00:29:55,890
Guest 0: And I think for me, I always thought like, oh, that's something weird that they just kind of created for the kids as part of like Nazism.

289
00:29:56,452 --> 00:30:06,310
Guest 0: But that really is a manifestation of a much more deeper line of youth movements throughout Germans early 20th century history.

290
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:19,590
Guest 0: And they talk about how a lot of the youth movements were the formation part or formation points of true nationalism and strong militaristic wills, so to speak.

291
00:30:20,313 --> 00:30:22,130
Rym: But it was also political indoctrination.

292
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:32,227
Rym: I mean, politics is such a big part of day to day life that in the universities, too, a lot of these universities had crazy political demagogues running them.

293
00:30:33,712 --> 00:30:34,590
Rym: And you see that everywhere.

294
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:43,310
Rym: Like there's these tiny sort of almost autocratic empires within all these spheres all throughout the German government, German society.

295
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:45,689
Rym: I mean, the unions were run like political parties.

296
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:49,230
Rym: The unions also had their own militias to a degree as far as I could glean.

297
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:52,144
Guest 0: It does call back to your earlier point about how politically active Germans were.

298
00:30:53,452 --> 00:30:56,647
Guest 0: And maybe it says something about political apathy and how.

299
00:30:56,668 --> 00:30:57,525
Guest 0: maybe it's all right.

300
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:58,895
Guest 1: Well, they were talking about.

301
00:30:58,956 --> 00:31:11,110
Guest 1: they talk about the voting of a mature democracy or a republic from a like a new one and how, you know, you actually kind of want over time voting to almost drop out a little bit.

302
00:31:11,472 --> 00:31:13,369
Guest 0: If people don't vote, that means they're happy, you know?

303
00:31:13,756 --> 00:31:13,842
Guest 0: Yeah.

304
00:31:14,131 --> 00:31:15,429
Guest 0: And maybe that's a good thing.

305
00:31:17,755 --> 00:31:18,599
Rym: Well, is it just that?

306
00:31:18,739 --> 00:31:23,079
Rym: do you need the formation of the democracy to be far enough out of living memory?

307
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:29,030
Rym: that there's this sort of this momentum humans seem to have where the way things were when they were born is kind of a default.

308
00:31:29,191 --> 00:31:34,809
Rym: So if enough people are born during a world where this is just how the government works, did they just get used to it?

309
00:31:35,534 --> 00:31:37,230
Guest 0: I don't know if I agree with that.

310
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:46,990
Guest 0: I think it's much more, you know, after a government is formed, what's the stability of a nation?

311
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:49,090
Guest 0: You know, what does the economy look like?

312
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:54,150
Guest 0: How is sort of the stepping stone of social mobility?

313
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:56,028
Guest 0: Is there any sort of classism going on?

314
00:31:56,470 --> 00:32:07,227
Guest 0: Those are much stronger indicators of risks to a democracy or any sort of government versus, you know, I'm defaulting to the way it was 50 years ago.

315
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:14,844
Guest 0: Because even right now, I think everyone likes to default like, oh, the American democracy was so much stronger 30, 40 years ago.

316
00:32:15,891 --> 00:32:18,659
Guest 0: But you look at the early 20th century, and it really was not the case.

317
00:32:19,391 --> 00:32:22,769
Guest 0: I think it was much more brutal, and we kind of lose some of that.

318
00:32:23,411 --> 00:32:25,750
Guest 0: And much, I don't know, much less stable.

319
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:28,270
Rym: Well, like, look at the era of the political machines.

320
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:37,350
Rym: Like, that is actually, it's less violent, but otherwise not that different from sort of the deformed structure of later Weimar Republic government.

321
00:32:39,554 --> 00:32:43,668
Rym: Like, it was politicized, and people were very active in that politicization.

322
00:32:44,113 --> 00:32:45,889
Rym: But at the same time, it was not a true democracy.

323
00:32:46,091 --> 00:32:49,901
Rym: It was sort of these warring factions running their machines against each other.

324
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:52,709
Guest 0: So here's a question to kind of pull away.

325
00:32:53,953 --> 00:32:56,010
Guest 0: And I think this is kind of a natural segue.

326
00:32:56,890 --> 00:33:17,950
Guest 0: But looking at the way American democracy is now versus where the Weimar Republic was versus maybe other democracies, if you want to compare, what are the key indicators or what are the strengths and weaknesses that would allow for a corruption or fascist state or some other non-liberal progressive ideal?

327
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:27,949
Rym: Well, I think one big difference, just to compare it to Weimar Republic Germany, is that Germany had, basically, the military had its own political party.

328
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:31,750
Rym: The steel helmets were sort of like the military as a party.

329
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:40,365
Rym: And while there are leanings toward the Republican right among the military in the US, it's by no means universal or even a majority, probably.

330
00:33:40,992 --> 00:33:45,450
Rym: So the military is not its own factor in our politics.

331
00:33:45,771 --> 00:33:51,069
Rym: And it hasn't been, well, you can argue if you go far enough back, but it hasn't been in modern history.

332
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:55,910
Guest 1: Well, and it's also directly controlled by the civilian end of the government.

333
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:56,443
Rym: True.

334
00:33:56,590 --> 00:34:00,570
Rym: But I think that's one significant difference is that there is no military party.

335
00:34:01,293 --> 00:34:01,878
Rym: But it's possible.

336
00:34:01,918 --> 00:34:04,289
Rym: that's just the side effect of the fact that there are only two parties.

337
00:34:05,171 --> 00:34:06,990
Guest 0: I think it's also the assumption that it's apolitical.

338
00:34:08,252 --> 00:34:13,442
Guest 0: But, I mean, to however much someone in the military can be apolitical, I don't know.

339
00:34:14,592 --> 00:34:23,382
Rym: I guess we treat the institution as being apolitical as opposed to, it is a party that has seats and is voting in the body that nominally controls it.

340
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:24,159
Guest 0: Yes.

341
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:38,290
Guest 1: I was going to say, again, on the institutions, before this election, I would have said, and I probably still will say, that I think our institutions are just stronger, like our press.

342
00:34:38,791 --> 00:34:46,230
Guest 1: We have a history of a free and investigative and hard-hitting press throughout.

343
00:34:46,870 --> 00:35:06,472
Guest 1: And we have a lot of institutions like the ACLU and whatnot that have really always worked to kind of check the government when it can, whether that-- I mean, I think we've been doing a disservice politically as one party decides that it's better off to try to undermine-- Well,

344
00:35:06,492 --> 00:35:07,950
Rym: like the undermining of the Supreme Court.

345
00:35:08,451 --> 00:35:13,530
Rym: We've been sitting for a long time with eight justices on our Supreme Court.

346
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:14,329
Guest 1: Yeah, and that's what I mean.

347
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:38,069
Guest 1: And as I'm saying, one party, not name of names, decides to just undermine the executive and the courts and decides that bringing public support, like bringing it down for those institutions is a good political strategy because then they'll want them in charge, right?

348
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:43,409
Guest 1: But in reality, it probably just weakens all those institutions for everybody.

349
00:35:44,752 --> 00:36:05,130
Rym: Well, for example, like the press, the press, like the professional press in the US, based on the Facebook data and some of the things we've been seeing just in the last few weeks, a surprising percentage of Americans seem to prefer fake news over actual news openly and may not be reachable by our otherwise strong institutions of the press anymore.

350
00:36:05,632 --> 00:36:07,989
Guest 1: It's even more nefarious than that, it seems like.

351
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:23,390
Guest 1: It seems like because they view all media with distrust, they view like the Washington Post at the same level as like US Uncut or Breitbart News or some other like kind of sensational rag that's not really doing journalism.

352
00:36:23,693 --> 00:36:25,469
Rym: But here's the sentence from the book.

353
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:42,129
Rym: What was undermining the political press in the 1920s was, above all, the rise of the so-called boulevard papers, cheap sensational tabloids that were sold on the streets, particularly afternoons, evenings, rather than depending on regular subscribers, heavily illustrated with massive maps of coverage of sports, cinema, local news, crime, scandal and sensation.

354
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:45,790
Rym: These papers place the emphasis on entertainment rather than information.

355
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:49,310
Guest 0: And each one of those papers was run by a political party.

356
00:36:50,012 --> 00:36:56,529
Rym: They all had a naked political sort of push like they were all agenda.

357
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:57,749
Guest 0: There is definitely an agenda.

358
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:08,947
Guest 1: But I would note that political news report and newspapers with a bend is nothing like new for the US either.

359
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:17,684
Guest 1: I mean, we only had a unbiased, neutral news since the end of like World War II.

360
00:37:17,971 --> 00:37:24,450
Guest 1: Before that, all the papers were run by either the Democrats or the Republicans or some random other force.

361
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:27,250
Rym: And I don't know if that's a strengthening or a weakening.

362
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:31,410
Guest 1: Well, it's clear we're going back to that in the United States.

363
00:37:32,839 --> 00:37:33,669
Guest 1: So we'll find out.

364
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:44,730
Guest 0: I think a lot of it is social media, but also the way people will unconsciously look for news that justifies their own biases.

365
00:37:45,332 --> 00:37:47,090
Guest 0: And everyone is guilty of this.

366
00:37:47,191 --> 00:37:47,967
Guest 0: I'm guilty of this.

367
00:37:48,531 --> 00:37:59,490
Guest 0: And it's hard to challenge yourself, especially when the Internet allows you to so easily surround yourself with sources that justify your worldview and doesn't challenge your worldview.

368
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:05,849
Rym: I mean, if I want to believe that what we're talking about here didn't happen, I can Google right now and find a paper that will tell me that it's all a lie.

369
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:19,835
Guest 0: But I think there is this period between the end of World War II and I guess kind of the dawn of the Internet where people are really limited in terms of where they could get their news.

370
00:38:20,439 --> 00:38:25,250
Guest 0: There's only so many TV channels, only so many radio stations, only so many newspapers that had wide distribution.

371
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:33,570
Guest 0: And so there really was a sort of ability to strive for excellence in your job as a journalist.

372
00:38:34,091 --> 00:38:50,730
Guest 0: Whereas now anyone with a keyboard can create a new quote unquote news site or source that looks just as justified, has just the same amount of information that the Washington Post has, but will justify your worldview.

373
00:38:52,111 --> 00:38:54,850
Guest 0: And it's literally a click away, not even a click away.

374
00:38:55,450 --> 00:39:07,048
Guest 1: I mean, at the same time, during those times in the Cold War period, especially the media was more likely to just take a blind eye to something the government was doing, especially if they were told to not really report it.

375
00:39:08,152 --> 00:39:10,910
Rym: Whereas now, of course, even then, there were always leaks.

376
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,370
Rym: There was always someone willing to push.

377
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:20,372
Rym: How many military institutions during the Cold War bases and things were revealed by press who kind of wouldn't shut up?

378
00:39:20,694 --> 00:39:26,282
Rym: That happened enough to where the press was far from the monolithic entity that you saw him say the Soviet Union.

379
00:39:30,417 --> 00:39:31,710
Guest 0: Is there anything else we want to say about this?

380
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:35,230
Guest 0: Otherwise, I kind of want to ask questions about this week and the last two weeks.

381
00:39:36,114 --> 00:39:37,649
Rym: I guess I got two last questions here.

382
00:39:38,295 --> 00:39:39,190
Rym: When was it too late?

383
00:39:39,472 --> 00:39:42,530
Rym: What was the point at which this was going to be inevitable?

384
00:39:43,311 --> 00:39:48,190
Rym: This rise of this radical extremist genocidal far right?

385
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:51,437
Rym: Like, was there a point where there was literally no chance of return?

386
00:39:51,518 --> 00:39:52,530
Rym: And how early was that?

387
00:39:53,531 --> 00:40:00,690
Guest 0: I think it really was kind of the post Great Depression.

388
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:24,930
Guest 0: Howard, there was a president or prime minister of the... He was a social democrat who essentially took severe steps to limit the power of the government or the Reichstag and put a lot of exclusive powers under the president, whether justfully or not in order to get through that situation.

389
00:40:26,151 --> 00:40:33,549
Guest 0: And I think that erosion of the institution of the government itself is kind of the last step.

390
00:40:34,412 --> 00:40:41,029
Guest 0: And whether it was going to be the Nazis or someone else who took power, that's the point where this experiment of the republic has failed.

391
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:44,929
Guest 1: I also think I pretty much agree with you.

392
00:40:45,771 --> 00:40:59,267
Guest 1: I think also just the widespread acceptance of violence in politics kind of doomed things, because there's so many times like we were talking about where people were arrested and just let go.

393
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:00,890
Guest 1: And you were just like, oh, okay.

394
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:01,450
Rym: Well, that was it.

395
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:06,868
Rym: It wasn't just that the government was turning a blind eye is that it only turned a blind eye to certain political movements.

396
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:11,826
Guest 1: I mean, they literally were declaring war on the communist section.

397
00:41:15,317 --> 00:41:18,449
Guest 1: And while they were just letting the Nazis beat the crap out of everybody.

398
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:20,309
Rym: But yeah, in general, I think you're right.

399
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:31,849
Rym: Like Hitler becoming chancellor was just formalizing the fact that there was absolute power in that very limited body and all it would take was anyone willing to use it.

400
00:41:32,051 --> 00:41:37,330
Rym: The Reichstag was done and the Reichstag elections basically became meaningless almost overnight.

401
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:44,490
Rym: Like it didn't matter that the Social Democrats still had most of the seats as late as 1930.

402
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:54,890
Rym: They were still the biggest party and it literally didn't matter because that body didn't actually have any power to affect change and didn't have any governance over the rest of the institutions of governments.

403
00:41:55,810 --> 00:42:05,510
Guest 1: I mean, you could argue that they had a chance if like the Nationalist Party decided not to ally with the Nazi Party at that moment that they could have maybe turned things around.

404
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:09,770
Guest 1: But that's really like the point of no return.

405
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:23,210
Rym: There might have been a chance on literally like when Hitler was appointed chancellor, like when all those marches started all at once, like basically when the Nazis openly went out into the streets and started just actively attacking people and forming the marches.

406
00:42:23,852 --> 00:42:33,668
Rym: That was that moment where the communists and basically everyone on the left and center, if they had met that with violence, might have undermined the new forming government and forced it.

407
00:42:34,312 --> 00:42:38,170
Rym: It might have delayed the total coming to power of the Nazis by a few years.

408
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:44,570
Rym: I don't know if it would have stopped something eventually like this happening, but I think it might have stopped this instance of it from happening.

409
00:42:46,051 --> 00:42:56,469
Guest 0: I think it really is like you can say, oh, they could have thrown one last violent act, but it would have to be extraordinarily coordinated and powerful to do that.

410
00:42:56,892 --> 00:43:09,970
Guest 0: And that's kind of one of the risk is like as you normalize each one of these steps down the process of just taking down your Republic, it's that much harder to bring it back by whatever means violent or political.

411
00:43:10,452 --> 00:43:20,689
Guest 0: So that's why you can let yourself get too far along that spectrum of normalization of, oh, well, it's okay if we do it, we'll just take this one step and it'll be fine.

412
00:43:21,311 --> 00:43:27,890
Guest 0: Or, okay, we won't call out so and so or this political party or say this isn't right because they're a small minority.

413
00:43:28,253 --> 00:43:29,729
Guest 0: They won't have a real strong voice.

414
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:32,708
Guest 0: And that's that danger of letting it get too far.

415
00:43:32,729 --> 00:43:44,409
Guest 0: is that when you do get to that last point and it is kind of, you know, you're on the cliff, it takes an almost insurmountable amount of power to stop that change from happening.

416
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:54,510
Rym: I think there's also a side point there that I'm just thinking about this, thinking about all the interactions that the Nazis had once they had a little bit of power and the rest of the government sort of treated them as well.

417
00:43:54,813 --> 00:43:56,430
Rym: They'll fail just like all of us did.

418
00:43:56,650 --> 00:44:00,490
Rym: And then their movement will fizzle out and they'll become more normal and more like the rest of us.

419
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:02,129
Rym: And we'll have to form a coalition government again.

420
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:09,350
Rym: But the Nazis seem to be the only major party that acted directly in bad faith.

421
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:13,437
Rym: Like they would make a deal and then immediately renege on it like they would like.

422
00:44:13,638 --> 00:44:17,089
Rym: any concession you made to that party was never given back.

423
00:44:17,612 --> 00:44:25,130
Rym: And yet every other party would continue to give further and further and further concessions like a party that's acting in good faith.

424
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:27,010
Rym: You can't work with them on anything.

425
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:28,950
Rym: That's the whole fruit of a poison tree.

426
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:30,510
Rym: It doesn't matter that there's fruit there.

427
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:31,450
Rym: The tree is still poisoned.

428
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:39,210
Guest 0: When a non rational actor enters a game with only purely irrational actors, the system breaks down, right?

429
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:39,578
Rym: Yep.

430
00:44:39,791 --> 00:44:43,010
Rym: Unless all of the rational actors agree to form a coalition.

431
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:47,490
Guest 0: Unless they call it that bullshit and they're like, hey, you're fucking just choosing your card at random.

432
00:44:47,711 --> 00:44:48,083
Guest 0: Fuck you.

433
00:44:48,792 --> 00:44:49,945
Guest 0: Then that's it.

434
00:44:51,153 --> 00:44:51,910
Rym: But they didn't.

435
00:44:52,011 --> 00:44:57,350
Rym: In fact, I mean, the center party allied with them, expecting that they would get these concessions.

436
00:44:57,531 --> 00:45:01,750
Rym: And they were given like in writing these very specific concessions about the church.

437
00:45:01,992 --> 00:45:05,670
Rym: And literally, as soon as the STP was out of the picture, all that disappeared.

438
00:45:06,251 --> 00:45:13,050
Rym: Like, you can't negotiate with someone who themselves is in a position of power over you or could be in a position of power over you in the future.

439
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:19,009
Guest 1: I just I mean, the communists were like such the tragic group in that.

440
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:20,469
Guest 1: I mean, they had the wrong idea.

441
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:31,810
Guest 1: They kind of went about things in a way that undermined them and also undermined any other group that could theoretically work with them in a way that would have prevented.

442
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:48,628
Guest 1: And since they wanted to also undermine the government, just in a different way, it really put the social Democrats and the centrists in a really bad position to ultimately not have anyone else to back up and form a coalition government with.

443
00:45:48,911 --> 00:45:55,589
Rym: Especially when they were just as well armed and organized paramilitarily as the Nazis were for a long time.

444
00:45:56,410 --> 00:46:00,729
Rym: But they made an enemy of everyone so they could never really use that.

445
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:04,150
Rym: Not that I'm saying that that would have necessarily led to a better future for Germany.

446
00:46:04,832 --> 00:46:04,941
Guest 1: No.
