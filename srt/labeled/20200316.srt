Rym: Yeah, we've been practicing and I could go to my work and be alone.

17
00:00:49,893 --> 00:00:58,735
Rym: We were doing a lot of people working from home thing for a couple weeks But now we're in the situation where due to the city's rule changes and everything in midtown being empty It's just 100% work from home.

18
00:00:58,756 --> 00:00:59,318
Scott: Yeah, I'm like.

00:00:59,419 --> 00:01:07,290
Scott: so after I left work on Wednesday night They messaged and said all right, we're gonna test working from home for everyone Thursday in front.

20
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:08,680
Rym: Oh, we did that a couple weeks ago.

21
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:19,063
Scott: Of course my team You know, I guess the rest of the company doesn't have this but my team of programmer people Basically, we already worked from home sort of whenever we wanted mostly right?

22
00:01:19,484 --> 00:01:21,290
Scott: I you did it actually less than other people.

23
00:01:22,151 --> 00:01:27,126
Scott: I just did it like when I needed to get shit done like laundry or you know chores errands.

24
00:01:27,146 --> 00:01:30,863
Scott: Yeah, and anyway It's already knew I could work from home.

25
00:01:30,884 --> 00:01:31,589
Scott: I need to test it.

26
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,197

00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:58,236
Scott: Yeah, there's a message like okay all next week working from home and then apparently sometime on Sunday The message was work from home until April 6th, which is this week next week in the week after so At least April 6 who knows.

Rym: We Emily and I both working home made some lunch.

34
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:13,219
Rym: Like we're just cooking food because restaurants are all closed.

35
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:13,721
Rym: Obviously.

36
00:02:13,741 --> 00:02:15,969
Scott: Yeah, they'll do delivery or takeout.

37
00:02:16,189 --> 00:02:21,008
Rym: Yep I'm gonna see tomorrow if the Baroness will continue to do takeout or if they're just gonna shut down.

00:02:21,189 --> 00:02:27,258
Scott: Yeah, so on Saturday Saturday Sunday, I think I forget.

00:02:27,358 --> 00:02:28,201
Scott: I think it was Saturday.

40
00:02:28,944 --> 00:02:29,466
Scott: I don't remember.

41
00:02:29,486 --> 00:02:30,430
Scott: It was just a blur.

42
00:02:30,611 --> 00:02:32,042
Scott: Basically, I'm home all the time.

43
00:02:32,082 --> 00:02:33,050
Scott: So there's no separation.

44
00:02:33,323 --> 00:02:35,630
Rym: Yeah That's the thing that we're talking about that topic.

45
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:42,222
Rym: But the people when I've worked from home for long periods of time The lack of separation starts to make your life just feel like one long day.

46
00:02:42,503 --> 00:02:49,362
Scott: Anyway, so We're like, okay, let's order, you know, since we're all stuck at home.

47
00:02:49,723 --> 00:02:51,148
Scott: Let's order delivery from Vesta.

48
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,616
Rym: Half fancy get the lasagna.

49
00:02:55,697 --> 00:02:58,866
Scott: Yeah, and so delivery shows up very promptly.

50
00:02:58,966 --> 00:02:59,849
Scott: delicious food, right?

51
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,900
Scott: The delivery guy hands me the hand the bag.

52
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,864
Scott: I take the bag.

53
00:03:03,904 --> 00:03:04,487
Scott: I turn around.

54
00:03:04,527 --> 00:03:05,090
Scott: I say goodbye.

55
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:06,154
Scott: He goes in the elevator.

56
00:03:06,174 --> 00:03:07,439
Scott: I close the door.

57
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:13,122
Scott: I start walking towards the table and then All the food falls out of the bottom of the bone.

58
00:03:13,786 --> 00:03:15,678
Scott: Oh, no That is not what I expected.

59
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:16,323
Rym: I thought it was gonna like.

60
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:17,289
Rym: then the doorbell rings.

61
00:03:17,551 --> 00:03:25,650
Scott: No, whoa, and I'm like, I'm just like I there was like less than a fraction of a second Oh where I felt something wrong.

62
00:03:26,772 --> 00:03:28,323
Scott: And then I'm looking at food all over the floor.

63
00:03:28,504 --> 00:03:29,290
Rym: I know that feeling.

64
00:03:29,611 --> 00:03:33,390
Scott: I know only the Brussels sprouts stayed in their metal container with plastic lid.

65
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:37,350
Rym: No, it'd be easier to deal with them than the lasagna because I assume you got a lasagna.

66
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,676
Scott: Oh, there's a lasagna on the floor.

67
00:03:38,716 --> 00:03:40,423
Scott: There was a cheesecake on the floor.

68
00:03:40,443 --> 00:03:41,829
Scott: There was a pasta on the floor.

69
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,686
Rym: The worst thing is what do you do other than go?

70
00:03:45,173 --> 00:03:50,517
Scott: So We I called the restaurant and it was like look this is crazy But this is what happened.

71
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,189
Scott: and then I called grub hub and they said, okay Well, we'll refund you for everything except Brussels sprouts.

72
00:03:56,813 --> 00:03:59,989
Scott: So then because we were so crazy hungry we ate the Brussels sprouts.

73
00:04:00,732 --> 00:04:03,485
Scott: So I call and then I called the restaurant back and I said, you know what?

74
00:04:03,525 --> 00:04:04,490
Scott: We're just fucking coming there.

75
00:04:05,055 --> 00:04:09,589
Scott: so we went there and We ate exactly the same thing we ordered.

76
00:04:11,193 --> 00:04:12,088
Scott: And then we went back home.

77
00:04:12,973 --> 00:04:13,458
Scott: Yeah, it was.

78
00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:15,293
Scott: it was Really me.

79
00:04:15,374 --> 00:04:17,745
Rym: That's a you know, I remember a moment.

80
00:04:17,845 --> 00:04:18,608
Scott: It was very meh.

81
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:23,690
Rym: It was similarly a meh moment, but this was way back and we lived in Beacon and I was just real sick.

82
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:24,775
Rym: I had like a real bad flu.

83
00:04:24,815 --> 00:04:26,402
Rym: you were like off at work like doing your normal thing.

84
00:04:26,442 --> 00:04:34,913
Rym: I was home alone was sick and The only food we had left in the house that was like easy enough to cook when I was sick was the last Jamaican beef Patty.

85
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:36,443
Scott: Oh you and your Jamaican beef patty.

86
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:37,370
Rym: I used to love those things.

87
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,509
Rym: So I found out they were basically just a hundred percent trans fat.

88
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,538
Rym: But I mean I didn't.

89
00:04:42,578 --> 00:04:44,529
Rym: trans fat wasn't known to be bad back then.

90
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:50,830
Rym: So I have the Jamaican beef patty and I've heated it up in the convection oven and I put it on.

91
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,014
Scott: Remember that a convection oven?

92
00:04:52,336 --> 00:04:55,428
Rym: Well the little toaster oven a regular toaster toaster oven.

93
00:04:55,548 --> 00:04:55,990
Rym: Yeah, it did.

94
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,315
Rym: It also is a convection oven.

95
00:04:57,396 --> 00:04:58,360
Rym: it had a convection mode.

96
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,585
Scott: I don't think you had a fan in it.

97
00:05:00,188 --> 00:05:00,690
Rym: Oh, it did.

98
00:05:01,011 --> 00:05:03,282
Rym: I remember that one very well, which one you're talking about?

99
00:05:03,322 --> 00:05:03,603
Rym: mine?

100
00:05:03,663 --> 00:05:05,050
Rym: the one that broke and we threw it away later.

101
00:05:06,071 --> 00:05:17,950
Rym: Anyway, I cooked this Jamaican beef patty and I put it on the last of the of the kitchen Where I had from RIT when I lived in the dorms those clear glass plates that were scratched to hell.

102
00:05:18,131 --> 00:05:21,490
Rym: Okay, and I turned around and it caught on the sleeve of my towel.

103
00:05:21,611 --> 00:05:30,485
Rym: I was wrapped in because that's how sick I was and it and the towel flung the plate End-over-end onto the ground and the plate shattered on the Jamaican beef patty.

104
00:05:30,926 --> 00:05:32,190
Rym: Oh the last food we had.

105
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,763
Scott: There's no eating that beef patty now.

106
00:05:33,783 --> 00:05:41,230
Rym: I Am not too proud to admit that I did end up eating about a third of that Jamaican beef patty.

107
00:05:41,331 --> 00:05:42,330
Scott: shards of glass in your gut.

108
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:50,309
Rym: So this glass broke into big chunks and there was a piece of Jamaican beef patty that had like broken off and was on the floor Just dirty but without it.

109
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:58,822
Rym: So I basically picked the dirt off the bottom and like cut the cut it up and I ate what I could and that was Literally the saddest meal I've ever had in my entire life.

110
00:05:58,862 --> 00:06:12,160
Rym: and now your son do the big Wall Street money Used to eat Jamaican beef patties Jamaican beef patties while hiding my car from the repo guy And eating eating Johnny cakes on a regular basis.

111
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:12,481
Rym: Okay.

112
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:15,110
Rym: Well, it was not that long ago in my life anyway.

113
00:06:15,451 --> 00:06:16,134
Rym: Yep, though.

114
00:06:16,194 --> 00:06:25,587
Rym: There is one pretty interesting and good news about Grubbub and like delivery orders and all that They have suspended the Commission's they charge to independent restaurants.

115
00:06:25,988 --> 00:06:26,530
Scott: I don't know.

116
00:06:26,731 --> 00:06:28,159
Scott: So why don't they just do this permanently?

117
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,929
Rym: Well, because then they can't make any money too bad.

118
00:06:30,573 --> 00:06:33,044
Rym: I mean, yeah, we should nationalize a bunch of things like.

119
00:06:33,064 --> 00:06:36,299
Rym: I'm not getting there I'm just saying that this is a private company.

120
00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:38,870
Rym: That is this is not pure altruism.

121
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:46,796
Rym: It's definitely enlightened self-interest because if you are the company that delivers food from restaurants to people and all the restaurants go out of Business you to go out of business.

122
00:06:47,278 --> 00:06:51,210
Rym: So it is in your enlightened self-interest to help restaurants not go out of business.

123
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:51,731
Scott: That's true.

124
00:06:52,393 --> 00:06:54,700
Rym: and to they're only doing it for independent restaurants.

125
00:06:54,821 --> 00:06:57,970
Rym: Like if you order from McDonald's, they're still gonna charge McDonald's that Commission.

126
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,716
Scott: I didn't know McDonald's was on Grubhub dude.

127
00:06:59,736 --> 00:07:01,341
Rym: All the fast food is just why would you?

128
00:07:01,361 --> 00:07:04,190
Rym: I could get Taco Bell delivered here right now.

129
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,578
Rym: I could get White Castle delivered here.

130
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:06,423
Rym: Please don't.

131
00:07:06,443 --> 00:07:08,234
Rym: I kind of want to get a White Castle Please don't?

132
00:07:08,657 --> 00:07:10,388
Rym: White Castle has a vegan options.

133
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:13,420
Rym: now They got a possible White Castle.

134
00:07:13,661 --> 00:07:15,407
Scott: still White Castle whether it's vegan or not.

135
00:07:15,467 --> 00:07:16,230
Rym: I love White Castle.

136
00:07:16,431 --> 00:07:19,078
Rym: Okay, White Castle, you know my brain.

137
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:25,896
Rym: my mouth not my brain so much but my mouth and maybe my brain stem Really want to eat a Jamaican beef.

138
00:07:26,017 --> 00:07:34,090
Scott: If I owned White Castle, I would open up a new restaurant called Black Castle And it would actually be like ridiculously high quality food.

139
00:07:34,752 --> 00:07:38,106
Scott: Not like, you know fast food, but it would be like Black Castle.

140
00:07:38,146 --> 00:07:40,710
Rym: No white or White Palace maybe.

141
00:07:42,914 --> 00:07:48,041
Rym: Yeah Yeah, make the portcullis just the portcullis portcullis.

142
00:07:48,162 --> 00:07:50,909
Rym: Yeah, make the other fort white fort anyway.

143
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:53,757
Scott: Yeah food all over the floor.

144
00:07:53,817 --> 00:07:56,730
Scott: her was you know in the grand scheme.

145
00:07:56,771 --> 00:08:06,890
Scott: That's not really a disaster But it just felt so disastrous because to be so hungry and to have all the fixed food all over the floor and like the wasting of the food just felt so bad.

146
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,056
Scott: I mean a lasagna all over the floor.

147
00:08:09,116 --> 00:08:13,870
Rym: the scale in the scale of our two stories and the time separation.

148
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:21,877
Rym: They're very different stories, but I think we both felt in that brief moment the same pain just like some great just like a great force.

149
00:08:24,472 --> 00:08:26,924
Rym: One mouth suddenly is very sad.

150
00:08:26,945 --> 00:08:30,280
Rym: Oh I feel like that gave the Thursday show.

151
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,023
Rym: food disasters.

152
00:08:31,465 --> 00:08:32,570
Scott: I don't have any other food disaster.

153
00:08:32,831 --> 00:08:34,174
Rym: I have a couple not many.

154
00:08:34,677 --> 00:08:35,921
Rym: most of them are more.

155
00:08:36,261 --> 00:08:38,710
Rym: my parents failed in a cooking of some kind.

156
00:08:39,153 --> 00:08:41,269
Scott: I remember at least one fire in the stove.

157
00:08:42,374 --> 00:08:47,115
Rym: I remember a lot of food disasters at RIT that were not caused by us but we.

158
00:08:47,336 --> 00:08:55,070
Rym: the fire alarm would go off and we'd come out and We can all tell which apartment caused the problem and multiple times.

159
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:58,521
Rym: It was a specific apartment and had two people who we know living in it.

160
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,708
Rym: Mm-hmm, but I don't think we ever caused it.

161
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:04,753
Rym: Nope so, uh, I Was feeling.

162
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:08,890
Rym: you know, usually around this time of year I get antsy I get that spring feeling that well.

163
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,629
Scott: Hey, first of all, we have not done a Monday show since last year.

164
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:14,778
Rym: Yeah already March Monday was like the hardest hit by our.

165
00:09:14,898 --> 00:09:16,944
Scott: Monday is still the hardest day to do.

166
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:19,913
Scott: send us Monday show ideas because we Don't have any.

167
00:09:20,013 --> 00:09:29,443
Rym: Yep, cuz usually when you run out of Monday show ideas Rym wants to do I would be happy if Monday was just what's the most recent tech news?

168
00:09:29,463 --> 00:09:30,888
Rym: Let's just do it twitch style, but better.

169
00:09:30,908 --> 00:09:40,772
Scott: But anyway so The rule that we have come up with is that we can do tech news roundup once a year and that happens to be in March.

170
00:09:40,852 --> 00:09:42,338
Scott: the last time we did it was.

171
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:49,883
Scott: it's been over a year since the last tech news roundup But yet I was already doing a tech news roundup the one time.

172
00:09:50,204 --> 00:09:53,537
Rym: usually that the story goes Rym says Let's do a tech news roundup.

173
00:09:53,557 --> 00:09:59,039
Rym: Scott says when was the last time we did it and Rym says fuck Yeah, sometimes it go Rym Scott.

174
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:02,209
Rym: Scott says when was the last time we did it and Rym says it's been over a year.

175
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:04,076
Rym: And then I'm really excited and we do it.

176
00:10:04,718 --> 00:10:05,441
Rym: I wasn't ready.

177
00:10:05,842 --> 00:10:09,738
Rym: No next Monday the next Monday show We do will definitely be a tech news round.

178
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:15,199
Scott: Oh, we send us ideas to the Monday show after that one Yep, but also send us tech news.

179
00:10:15,801 --> 00:10:17,446
Scott: Yep, cuz I haven't found any tech news.

180
00:10:17,506 --> 00:10:17,867
Scott: I'm used.

181
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,678
Scott: I got a news That's from last year.

182
00:10:19,698 --> 00:10:21,029
Rym: All right, here's the tech news.

183
00:10:21,411 --> 00:10:23,382
Scott: So Rym's doing his news first, I guess.

184
00:10:23,402 --> 00:10:29,944
Rym: Yeah, so said he at home Is pretty forgotten by younger people like young people don't even know this exists.

185
00:10:30,084 --> 00:10:35,346
Scott: Yeah, this was basically the first Major project that was distributed computing, right?

186
00:10:35,627 --> 00:10:38,790
Scott: Well, there was this distributed computing to consumer PCs.

187
00:10:38,851 --> 00:10:46,718
Scott: Yeah the idea that Someone with a lot of computer processing that they needed to do Would in the olden days get a supercomputer.

188
00:10:46,878 --> 00:10:50,270
Scott: and there are still supercomputers that do these things that used for like weather modeling and shit.

189
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:55,067
Scott: Right, but what they said he at home was like, hey, we don't want to pay for a supercomputer.

190
00:10:55,128 --> 00:10:55,670
Scott: Let's do this.

191
00:10:56,313 --> 00:11:23,050
Scott: Let's break up all of our input data in the chunks send the chunks out to Different people with normal computers at their homes and those normal computers will process that input data using their home desktop Intel CPU and they'll be volunteering their CPU and the program will run when the person's not using their computer and Now it won't slow them down when they are using the computer because otherwise the CPU is just going away sitting there not being used.

192
00:11:23,132 --> 00:11:31,909
Scott: Yeah And then we'll send all of its outputs back to the main central repository will be stored and collated and then we'll send them more inputs.

193
00:11:31,929 --> 00:11:34,415
Scott: and It was a really good idea.

194
00:11:34,435 --> 00:11:35,921
Scott: A lot of people followed on.

195
00:11:35,941 --> 00:11:37,345
Scott: Yeah, this is real exciting.

196
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:40,613
Rym: And remember this shit is from 1999.

197
00:11:40,613 --> 00:11:40,894
Rym: Oh, yeah.

198
00:11:41,115 --> 00:11:42,881
Scott: So in college a lot of people ran this.

199
00:11:42,941 --> 00:11:44,265
Scott: I ran time to time.

200
00:11:44,325 --> 00:11:45,148
Rym: I ran in high school.

201
00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:48,899
Scott: Yeah And it was a thing and it's continued to be a thing.

202
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:50,645
Scott: and they would process the data from.

203
00:11:50,665 --> 00:12:03,598
Scott: that of you know radars and telescopes listening to radio signals from outer space and the idea was basically to Look at all the data that no one's looking at too closely to figure out the amount of data They were collecting was so enormous.

204
00:12:03,618 --> 00:12:10,369
Scott: You're listening to all of outer space 24/7 to a vast variety of radio frequencies at all times.

205
00:12:11,134 --> 00:12:12,501
Scott: That's a lot of data coming in.

206
00:12:12,843 --> 00:12:13,990
Scott: you need a lot of you know.

207
00:12:14,272 --> 00:12:16,188
Scott: You can't look at it all with even with a supercomputer.

208
00:12:16,248 --> 00:12:21,068
Rym: Yep and remember back then there weren't like bitcoins to mine or anything like this was it.

209
00:12:21,309 --> 00:12:29,518
Rym: and Because a lot of the people had computers were more nerdy people were kind of into it and it was partly like people got Excited about SETI and excited about science.

210
00:12:29,599 --> 00:12:31,544
Scott: It felt also like, you know, I'm helping.

211
00:12:31,564 --> 00:12:41,210
Scott: well, not just you're helping but like hey I bought this computer, but I'm not sitting at it It's just sitting there going to waste this expensive fancy machine and back then it didn't use that much power.

212
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,204
Scott: It's pointless for it to sit here doing nothing.

213
00:12:43,224 --> 00:12:44,030
Scott: This is great.

214
00:12:44,372 --> 00:12:48,169
Rym: I mean the computer I ran this on first had like a 40 watt power supply.

215
00:12:48,582 --> 00:12:50,957
Scott: Yeah So since then there have been a lot of other.

216
00:12:51,017 --> 00:12:53,525
Scott: there's a platform called Boink Bo Inc.

217
00:12:53,886 --> 00:12:59,346
Scott: that hosts many Similar projects and you can choose which projects you want to dedicate CPU time to.

218
00:12:59,366 --> 00:13:06,461
Scott: yeah a big one I think still which has also been going on for a super long time And I think it's still going on is folding at home, which does protein folding.

219
00:13:06,501 --> 00:13:09,150
Scott: Yep to find various medical.

220
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:14,210
Rym: I think I even saw a coronavirus one folding protein specifically to help that research.

221
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:16,458
Scott: Yeah, so I think that's still out there.

222
00:13:16,518 --> 00:13:27,237
Rym: But yeah, so the news is SETI at home is Finally after all these years 21 years suspending operations And there's a lot of reasons for that.

223
00:13:27,277 --> 00:13:30,130
Scott: part of that means they're just not sending out new inputs to people who are running it.

224
00:13:30,371 --> 00:13:35,649
Rym: They're basically gonna spin it down for now partly because the architecture didn't really hold like it's old architecture.

225
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:37,128
Scott: Yeah Over the years.

226
00:13:37,891 --> 00:13:39,739
Rym: Yep, they're even telling people.

227
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:42,169
Rym: Hey, we encourage you to try these other boink based projects.

228
00:13:43,312 --> 00:13:44,521
Rym: Well, we decide what to do next.

229
00:13:44,923 --> 00:13:49,743
Rym: but it's on one hand The project is so old the tech has moved a long time like a long way since then.

230
00:13:49,763 --> 00:13:54,597
Rym: Oh, yeah - They've got a lot of data that now they're like.

231
00:13:54,798 --> 00:13:58,007
Rym: SETI at home did identify a bunch of things that require further study.

232
00:13:59,010 --> 00:13:59,655
Rym: Now they need to do that.

233
00:13:59,937 --> 00:14:00,663
Rym: They need to do the part.

234
00:14:00,683 --> 00:14:01,489
Rym: That's not as easy.

235
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:05,468
Scott: Couldn't it just make SETI at home to process the things that were already processed?

236
00:14:05,508 --> 00:14:05,890
Rym: possibly?

237
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:14,230
Rym: But the problem is will send out to you something all the work that people already did to Search through it, but not to turn this into the like distributed computing thing.

238
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:23,659
Rym: But the kinds of problems that are like use like the things that make sense to do this kind of distributed computing for a very particular kinds of problems.

239
00:14:24,021 --> 00:14:30,527
Rym: not every problem can be mapped to packets of Questions that can be answered by untrusted hardware.

240
00:14:30,749 --> 00:14:31,628
Scott: Nope Not at all.

241
00:14:32,712 --> 00:14:33,779
Rym: And it's a very like.

242
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,585
Rym: there's a whole trust.

243
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:38,730
Rym: but verify Mechanism in these systems that we do not have time to use all kinds of stuff going on there.

244
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,098
Scott: That could have been our Monday show idea.

245
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:42,049
Rym: Yep, but basically what they said is one.

246
00:14:42,872 --> 00:14:45,830
Rym: The result table has grown to the point where it no longer fits in their main memory.

247
00:14:46,251 --> 00:14:50,750
Rym: That's been slowing down the validators and the simulators which is causing result table to grow even further.

248
00:14:51,212 --> 00:14:54,042
Rym: They want to get that down to a managed manageable size.

249
00:14:54,262 --> 00:15:03,868
Rym: They're doing a whole bunch of stuff, but Probably said he at home will reemerge someday on a more modern platform with a different type of problem to solve.

250
00:15:04,349 --> 00:15:09,570
Rym: but Probably this kind of research does not need your individual computers help right now.

251
00:15:09,831 --> 00:15:14,750
Rym: No, and there are better problems to aim those computer resources at and not mining bit not mining bitcoins.

252
00:15:14,952 --> 00:15:16,389
Rym: Yeah, don't mind don't mind your coins.

253
00:15:16,579 --> 00:15:19,719
Scott: Yeah Don't mind any kind of coin and I I'm.

254
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:28,375
Rym: all I want to talk about is just that this is a very long running and I would argue Extremely successful project and Historically significant.

255
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:36,507
Rym: it only said to me how many people will only be learning about it today because it's ending Even if they weren't doing it, like I think a lot of younger people just don't even know it existed.

256
00:15:36,688 --> 00:15:49,950
Scott: Yep alright, so Usually when news happens we completely forget about it and the only news we talked about in the news section of the show is news that happened that day because I come to Do the show and I open up the news and I look and I see what's on the news that day.

257
00:15:50,432 --> 00:15:55,790
Scott: So if there was a news even the day before a GeekNights episode It's unlikely to be talked about on a GeekNights.

258
00:15:55,850 --> 00:16:05,930
Scott: Yep, and since we haven't done a Monday show since last year there was a news since last I think it was late last year that we didn't discuss in any Monday show because we haven't done a Monday show.

259
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:08,030
Rym: I think we've talked about it a little bit.

260
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:10,542
Scott: Yeah, we talked about it between us but not on the show.

261
00:16:10,682 --> 00:16:12,210
Rym: or maybe we did and we just couldn't find it.

262
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:15,327
Scott: But yeah, or we did talk about it on the show and we didn't actually remember.

263
00:16:15,368 --> 00:16:18,890
Scott: we did But I remembered because I couldn't find any decent tech news.

264
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:24,430
Scott: I managed to remember this old tech news because people are talking about VPNs because they're working from home.

265
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:30,868
Scott: yep, right and there was a VPN related news and that is there is a project called wire guard.

266
00:16:31,108 --> 00:16:34,920
Scott: right and Wire guard is pretty good VPN, right?

267
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,038
Scott: It's it's if you look at the source code relative to like other VPNs like say open VPN or any of those.

268
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:49,411
Scott: it's simpler easy to understand more well-coded more modern Just pretty much better in most ways Right.

269
00:16:49,512 --> 00:16:53,082
Scott: It's like a legit quality VPN for 2020.

270
00:16:53,082 --> 00:16:53,503
Scott: Yep.

271
00:16:53,904 --> 00:16:54,867
Rym: Nice and generic.

272
00:16:54,887 --> 00:17:00,263
Scott: It's pretty easy to set up Right and the news is that this VPN is B was.

273
00:17:00,384 --> 00:17:02,330
Scott: I mean, it's old news already like a few months old.

274
00:17:02,753 --> 00:17:05,634
Scott: It is being included in Linux kernel.

275
00:17:05,654 --> 00:17:08,406
Scott: it's like the kernel has this VPN just fucking in it.

276
00:17:08,646 --> 00:17:09,430
Rym: Yep, right.

277
00:17:09,733 --> 00:17:19,349
Scott: So basically for all intents and purposes This is now the VPN of choice like, you know All those other VPN softwares get out of the way.

278
00:17:19,993 --> 00:17:21,929
Scott: Wire guard is the king right now.

279
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:22,351
Rym: This is.

280
00:17:22,632 --> 00:17:27,410
Rym: this is similarly big news to way back when DRBD became a common part of Linux, right?

281
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:30,082
Scott: And I don't think people are using that too much anymore.

282
00:17:30,223 --> 00:17:31,610
Rym: I do still see people using it.

283
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:34,401
Scott: It's not being non used but I think it has been eclipsed.

284
00:17:34,482 --> 00:17:42,790
Rym: Well, I think it's been eclipsed by cloud computing Yes, and because you don't need to solve that problem that way if you're not using physical hardware directly exactly.

285
00:17:43,813 --> 00:18:00,688
Scott: But yeah, so I think you know There's a lot of people who are still currently using other sorts of VPNs and I gonna I think you're gonna see Over the next you know year or a few They're slowly all gonna be replaced with this the way that get another Linux project,

286
00:18:00,749 --> 00:18:00,969
Rym: right?

287
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:04,599
Scott: Slowly erased all the other source control.

288
00:18:04,619 --> 00:18:07,570
Rym: I think you'll see a lot of remote access applications only.

289
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,116
Scott: Yeah, it's only been a few months right.

290
00:18:09,196 --> 00:18:15,419
Rym: but even games I think bit by bit like I think people will use Wireguard on the back end of things.

291
00:18:15,459 --> 00:18:18,830
Rym: They're building that need a like pseudo local land, right?

292
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:22,430
Scott: And also this VPN since it is included in the kernel, right?

293
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:30,910
Scott: You can now when you're writing say a server that runs on Linux you can like count Possibly on it being there and then you could use it for something.

294
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:40,412
Scott: So like, you know, you could make all incorporate VPN into other projects much more easily without requiring That.

295
00:18:40,793 --> 00:18:45,130
Scott: you know the people running your project like separately set up a VPN.

296
00:18:45,351 --> 00:18:50,890
Rym: Well, like today say an old PC game like tribes - you want to play that with people on the internet?

297
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,909
Rym: You need to make some sort of fake network.

298
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:59,792
Scott: You need to make a fake VPN or a VPN of your own and then run tribes - and have tribes to think it's on A land.

299
00:19:00,094 --> 00:19:00,657
Scott: Yep, right.

300
00:19:00,859 --> 00:19:02,890
Rym: This would make that way easier.

301
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:06,705
Rym: If you just embedded that into your hacked libraries and you're right you can make it.

302
00:19:06,765 --> 00:19:12,670
Scott: you can now make a game Right and the game would connect to with Wireguard, right?

303
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:20,609
Scott: Invisibly and now everyone running the game is on a land with everyone else is playing the game Yeah, and now can play with each other.

304
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:22,914
Scott: So that's one.

305
00:19:22,994 --> 00:19:23,816
Scott: That's just one idea.

306
00:19:24,057 --> 00:19:25,240
Rym: Yep, and you know what.

307
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:28,008
Scott: and also it would say much better more secure, right?

308
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:30,163
Scott: Open-source VPN.

309
00:19:30,244 --> 00:19:35,684
Scott: Oh my god Definitely does not have backdoors inserted by the government or any kind of shenanigans like.

310
00:19:35,825 --> 00:19:37,289
Scott: also you can trust this shit.

311
00:19:37,329 --> 00:19:42,604
Rym: scan Other VPNs like looking at the configuration kind of like how it were like how you configure it.

312
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:44,510
Rym: It's pretty straightforward.

313
00:19:44,711 --> 00:19:45,537
Rym: Oh, yeah, it's way.

314
00:19:45,738 --> 00:19:47,410
Rym: This is not rocket science.

315
00:19:47,511 --> 00:20:00,275
Scott: It's actually like as like I said It's like a big step up in VPNs versus the same way they get was a big step up and they even say I'm gonna quote their own website compared to Behemoths like swan.

316
00:20:00,496 --> 00:20:01,859
Rym: Yeah, I be sec.

317
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,290
Rym: Yep open VPN open SSL in which auditing the job, right?

318
00:20:06,491 --> 00:20:13,670
Scott: For example, right open SSL on open SSL is a giant project that has a million cryptographic kinds of related things.

319
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:16,230
Rym: You can probably insert legit straight-up malware.

320
00:20:16,391 --> 00:20:17,817
Rym: No one would notice right you put it.

321
00:20:17,857 --> 00:20:20,870
Scott: but open SL is enormous cuz it's like it's like a Swiss Army knife.

322
00:20:21,171 --> 00:20:24,059
Scott: Encryption is security wire guard is just VPN.

323
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:24,922
Scott: It doesn't do anything else.

324
00:20:24,982 --> 00:20:25,564
Scott: Yeah, right.

325
00:20:25,584 --> 00:20:27,670
Scott: So that's why it's a lot better at it.

326
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:36,030
Rym: I'm increasingly a fan of elegant simple tools like this that are a server client But also just the library to use to do that thing.

327
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:44,255
Scott: so if you are out there and You are about to set up a VPN a new or a V say you're a tiny game studio And you don't have a work from home.

328
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:47,006
Scott: solution VPN like structure somewhere.

329
00:20:47,087 --> 00:20:47,910
Scott: Yeah anywhere.

330
00:20:48,391 --> 00:20:50,456
Scott: This should be the first thing you look at.

331
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:51,678
Scott: It's for a setting that shit up.

332
00:20:51,778 --> 00:21:04,090
Rym: No, I do think Generally it like if you're running a service or a company or a group you should try to use Tools that are already natively online and don't require a local like a LAN.

333
00:21:04,571 --> 00:21:13,219
Rym: But a VPN is a really quick way to take like an internal dev environment with giant assets that you haven't ported to Amazon Accessible to everyone or like right?

334
00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:15,170
Scott: I'm saying just listen to our VPN episode.

335
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:18,647
Scott: Yeah uses of VPN, but then use this one, but this one did not exist.

336
00:21:18,787 --> 00:21:19,310
Scott: We made that ever.

337
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:20,216
Rym: What the fuck did we?

338
00:21:20,277 --> 00:21:22,170
Scott: or these just wasn't included in the kernel?

339
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:24,749
Rym: I want to listen that all this what the hell did we tell people to use?

340
00:21:25,572 --> 00:21:30,125
Rym: Cuz I've set up VPNs before on like Cisco routers and that shit sucks.

341
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:30,486
Rym: Yeah.

342
00:21:30,927 --> 00:21:35,197
Scott: Well now you don't do that anymore Anything with Linux kernel run.

343
00:21:35,237 --> 00:21:36,664
Rym: Hello darkness my old friend.

344
00:21:37,126 --> 00:21:45,276
Rym: one last news More of a PSA, but I saw this story out of the UK and I feel like this could be a bigger problem For various reasons.

345
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:48,290
Rym: there seems to be a temporary toilet paper shortage in a bunch of parts.

346
00:21:48,511 --> 00:21:49,033
Scott: I don't know why.

347
00:21:49,273 --> 00:21:50,919
Scott: I still don't understand why you're buying TP.

348
00:21:50,939 --> 00:21:52,184
Scott: I got enough TP.

349
00:21:52,204 --> 00:21:53,950
Rym: I don't think your butts clean enough.

350
00:21:54,191 --> 00:21:57,084
Scott: I got plenty and the store has some.

351
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:57,305
Scott: well.

352
00:21:58,511 --> 00:22:06,829
Rym: So the funny thing is as much as I see all these shortages of TP in the US Even when I was in Midtown like Wednesday last week.

353
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:11,464
Rym: Yeah Like the TJ's and like all the like Costco's are also a lot of everything.

354
00:22:12,005 --> 00:22:20,130
Rym: the Kate Elliott toilet paper So did like the CVS like all the non big stores the toilet paper factory doesn't have like a shortage of paper.

355
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:22,337
Scott: They're still churning out rolls at the same rate.

356
00:22:22,377 --> 00:22:23,741
Scott: They were before there.

357
00:22:23,762 --> 00:22:31,350
Scott: You're just buying them too fast for no reason Yep, unless you were happen to have run out and like everyone's gonna be like my great aunt's house.

358
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,147
Scott: So they got too much TP.

359
00:22:32,571 --> 00:22:43,404
Rym: But my PSA is this if you somehow run out of toilet paper and have like a week where you can't get any Do not make air sats toilet paper out of things that are not flushable.

360
00:22:43,685 --> 00:22:45,190
Rym: That is how you get fat birds.

361
00:22:45,793 --> 00:22:50,250
Rym: Oh my god, like that will literally destroy the sewer system And then you're gonna have a problem.

362
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:56,807
Rym: Oh, yeah Like and I'm particularly talking about any of those flushable wipes that say they're flushable.

363
00:22:56,827 --> 00:22:57,890
Rym: Those things are not flushable.

364
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:01,208
Scott: No, but the only thing you should flush down the toilet is poop.

365
00:23:01,368 --> 00:23:04,569
Rym: Yep He water TP all their body fluids.

366
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:08,285
Rym: Like if you have a collection of blood you need to get rid of like sure vomit.

367
00:23:08,526 --> 00:23:09,290
Rym: Yeah all that.

368
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:12,543
Rym: Well, it depends on how much blood.

369
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:13,850
Scott: I guess it's okay.

370
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:16,843
Scott: Cuz like, you know if you're sick and like you pee blood you should.

371
00:23:17,004 --> 00:23:24,370
Rym: you can flush that if you've got The doctor if you have got more than say a quart of blood just hanging around.

372
00:23:24,912 --> 00:23:26,439
Rym: Do not pour that down the drain.

373
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,288
Rym: call either the police or a hospital.

374
00:23:28,348 --> 00:23:39,090
Rym: cuz someone Either I didn't have that either an ambulance or a police car needs to show up at your house And I'm sure you don't need any virus related news on GeekNights.

375
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:50,707
Scott: You can get that from places with actual doctors, but I don't want to let anyone know That Because there are no large gatherings and there should not be large gatherings, I guess for safety.

376
00:23:50,748 --> 00:23:53,436
Scott: That is what Doctors smarter than me say.

377
00:23:53,496 --> 00:23:58,453
Rym: no more than 50 people should get together in major cities as of like Dateline 630 p.m.

378
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:00,702
Rym: EDT on March 16.

379
00:24:00,702 --> 00:24:07,050
Scott: Anyway, because there are no large gatherings There is a very big shortage of blood that we just mentioned.

380
00:24:07,592 --> 00:24:15,370
Scott: Right because usually blood drives happen at large gatherings like anime Boston Is a shockingly big blood drive.

381
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:16,231
Scott: Yeah It's like.

382
00:24:16,271 --> 00:24:29,490
Scott: basically they have tables to donate blood and during anime Boston all those tables of blood donating were occupied the entire time of anime Boston And I saw lots of you walking anime Boston with like the gifts you got for donating or what?

383
00:24:30,012 --> 00:24:32,542
Rym: I gave almost every year the only I remember the last two years.

384
00:24:32,582 --> 00:24:38,923
Rym: I didn't give partly because I was worried I would get sick anyway from a from the nerds at the con with it.

385
00:24:39,224 --> 00:24:40,107
Rym: Not because of anyway.

386
00:24:40,287 --> 00:24:44,559
Scott: the point is It is safe to go and donate blood.

387
00:24:44,639 --> 00:24:47,650
Scott: if you go to a blood donating place, right?

388
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,034
Scott: They're hoping you come.

389
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:49,877
Scott: there's not.

390
00:24:49,957 --> 00:24:51,101
Scott: it's not a crowded place.

391
00:24:51,202 --> 00:24:52,647
Scott: It's a place full of doctors.

392
00:24:52,707 --> 00:24:53,470
Scott: It's a clean place.

393
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:55,861
Scott: Yeah, don't go there if you're fucking sick Jesus Christ.

394
00:24:55,881 --> 00:25:00,265
Rym: Yeah, and if there's a line out the door like yeah Maybe like no usually you make an appointment.

395
00:25:00,285 --> 00:25:05,989
Scott: You don't just show up But there will be a blood donating place near where you live wherever that is.

396
00:25:06,712 --> 00:25:07,193
Scott: Go there.

397
00:25:07,254 --> 00:25:09,863
Scott: I'll probably make an appointment whenever it's not I have to go to work.

398
00:25:10,104 --> 00:25:10,847
Scott: It's like I time.

399
00:25:10,867 --> 00:25:16,767
Scott: Yep And yeah, as long as you're not sick and answer their questions, honestly, don't lie to them.

400
00:25:17,068 --> 00:25:21,802
Scott: Yeah Even though there's one question that we know but that's not a topic for today.

401
00:25:21,862 --> 00:25:23,306
Rym: Yeah, that question bullshit.

402
00:25:23,427 --> 00:25:24,530
Rym: We know that question is bullshit.

403
00:25:24,711 --> 00:25:26,945
Rym: Yeah, everyone smart knows that question is bullshit.

404
00:25:26,965 --> 00:25:27,428
Rym: That's right.

405
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:37,786
Rym: but anyway, it's time for Things of the day.

406
00:25:37,806 --> 00:25:39,451
Rym: so I gotta be.

407
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:43,643
Rym: you know, a lot of the channels I watch on YouTube lately as Much as I love them.

408
00:25:43,684 --> 00:25:49,787
Rym: I can't just make them my things of the day because it's like tech moan the 8-bit guy big Clive.

409
00:25:49,867 --> 00:25:50,007
Rym: like.

410
00:25:50,208 --> 00:26:01,599
Rym: a lot of the videos I watch are from the same set of like 20 YouTube people who like Terrapin dodgy electronics or I will not link lock-picking lawyer again Yeah, unless he opens a lock by breathing on it.

411
00:26:01,801 --> 00:26:08,688
Rym: But I found one that I can link to because I haven't talked about it on GeekNights yet Practical engineering my favorite channels.

412
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:12,940
Rym: because one they're really short videos like five to ten minutes long.

413
00:26:13,641 --> 00:26:19,155
Rym: No - they're actually practical useful engineering concepts and skills.

414
00:26:19,416 --> 00:26:33,149
Rym: and they're things like uh Say you got like a tiny dam on a tiny creek in your town and you wonder what the deal is with like all those weird ridges at the bottom or like a berm or a Rainage-ditch or any of those kinds of things.

415
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:42,860
Rym: these videos explain like the physics and Engineering behind those in a very direct and practical way and it teaches actual useful practical skills.

416
00:26:43,122 --> 00:26:45,020
Rym: Okay, like how do you hold pipes together?

417
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,548
Rym: How do you hold pipes together underwater or underground?

418
00:26:47,789 --> 00:26:49,777
Rym: The answer is not weld them together very rarely.

419
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:50,359
Rym: Do they do that?

420
00:26:52,162 --> 00:27:02,788
Rym: Why if you if you have a faucet, here's one that actually might be super useful to some of you You have a faucet in your house or your school where if you close it too quickly You hear like this bang in the distance.

421
00:27:03,551 --> 00:27:05,176
Rym: That is real fucking bad news.

422
00:27:05,237 --> 00:27:06,180
Rym: It's called a water hammer.

423
00:27:06,743 --> 00:27:09,038
Scott: No, I have not had that never encountered that.

424
00:27:09,058 --> 00:27:10,705
Scott: no But I've had what faucets?

425
00:27:10,745 --> 00:27:14,320
Scott: we turn it on and they go and it goes digga digga digga and then the water comes out.

426
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,648
Rym: Yep, this can explain that too.

427
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:21,435
Rym: Okay, this channel is just real good And the one I'm gonna link to is why do pipes move underground like you put some pipes down.

428
00:27:22,117 --> 00:27:22,900
Rym: Why do they move?

429
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,005
Rym: Why is this a problem?

430
00:27:24,045 --> 00:27:24,488
Rym: Why do pipes?

431
00:27:24,649 --> 00:27:26,680
Rym: pipes break if nothing touch the earth is alive?

432
00:27:27,163 --> 00:27:28,450
Rym: It has nothing to do with the earth.

433
00:27:28,732 --> 00:27:29,637
Scott: things get hot and cold.

434
00:27:29,798 --> 00:27:39,813
Rym: nope Okay, it has to do primarily with the pressure of the fluid going through the pipes Coupled with when there are curves or joins in the pipes.

435
00:27:40,295 --> 00:27:41,640
Rym: Mm-hmm and it talks about that in detail.

436
00:27:41,721 --> 00:27:43,294
Rym: Yes, there are there like if there's an earthquake.

437
00:27:43,315 --> 00:27:47,580
Rym: Yes, that'll also Pipes, you know shit if you didn't fill the pipes in the right way.

438
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:57,276
Rym: but this channel is just really cool because it mostly shows very like He'll make a little rig to like demonstrate the principle that you could literally just go in your backyard and make in like a couple hours.

439
00:27:59,002 --> 00:28:01,994
Scott: So what he got so way back in the 70s, right some?

440
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,525
Scott: Enterprising person.

441
00:28:05,565 --> 00:28:06,007
Scott: What's their name?

442
00:28:06,028 --> 00:28:06,631
Scott: Steve Peck.

443
00:28:07,053 --> 00:28:08,280
Scott: Steve Peck, right?

444
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:13,560
Scott: After you know Looney Tunes had ended over a decade earlier, right?

445
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:17,959
Scott: At least they had Warner Brothers to stop making new ones before they started again, obviously, right?

446
00:28:19,104 --> 00:28:33,974
Scott: Made their own Elmer Fudd Bugs Bunny Daffy Duck cartoon in which Elmer Fudd is a drug dealer in Central Park and I clicked The mafia the mafia bosses.

447
00:28:33,994 --> 00:28:40,700
Scott: Oh my boy You're 70 are pressuring Elmer to sell his drugs to pay them what the what he owes.

448
00:28:41,663 --> 00:28:45,838
Scott: and Daffy and bugs are the addicts he's trying to sell to.

449
00:28:45,859 --> 00:28:50,560
Scott: and You know, they try to pull a fast one over on them because that's how they do.

450
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:53,991
Rym: I see people make videos like this to my little pony all the time.

451
00:28:54,031 --> 00:28:55,114
Rym: Why is this man?

452
00:28:55,155 --> 00:28:58,282
Scott: They basically did a complete Animation right.

453
00:28:58,302 --> 00:29:00,769
Scott: they animated all the characters and did all the voice acting.

454
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:10,203
Scott: only the most of the backgrounds are just like video of Central Park as opposed to drawn backgrounds And it's a complete Animation.

455
00:29:10,264 --> 00:29:14,000
Scott: it's like actually well like seven eight minutes long and a half minutes long, right?

456
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,699
Scott: It's like a full Looney Tune length.

457
00:29:16,782 --> 00:29:17,706
Scott: So the story.

458
00:29:17,847 --> 00:29:20,199
Scott: I think the person said that they showed it.

459
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,042
Rym: They showed you

460
00:29:21,143 --> 00:29:36,520
Scott: text Avery and text Avery loved it and what it would have was said like this is incredible Except I'm 80 years old and I can't offer you a job because I'm 80 years old yeah, and they showed it to Jones and Chuck Jones was conservative and like get this the fuck out of here you piece.

461
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:38,889
Scott: No, I said something not nice.

462
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:46,339
Rym: The coolest thing about this though is just that 1975 this is like yeah, this person had cells and animated by hand, right?

463
00:29:47,141 --> 00:29:51,014
Rym: They definitely you can see the VCR tech and like.

464
00:29:51,315 --> 00:29:58,572
Rym: they weren't the best at animating But they were pretty good better than me Yeah, especially considering the tool set yet available in 1975.

465
00:29:58,572 --> 00:30:05,227
Scott: the characters are off model The animations are little blare the resolutions bad, you know But still way better than I would do.

466
00:30:05,307 --> 00:30:08,359
Scott: and for a 70-something doing it at home, right?

467
00:30:09,842 --> 00:30:11,711
Scott: And also it's the writing.

468
00:30:11,731 --> 00:30:13,800
Scott: is you know, the pace is a little off?

469
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:14,282
Scott: It's not.

470
00:30:14,382 --> 00:30:18,238
Scott: it could use an editor too, but it still got some good gags in it.

471
00:30:18,258 --> 00:30:18,680
Rym: pretty funny.

472
00:30:18,821 --> 00:30:28,560
Rym: This is the kind of thing before YouTube in the modern internet where someone would like Have this file or have a VHS tape and bust it out at a party.

473
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,560
Rym: Oh, yeah, and people would like not even believe that it existed.

474
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:36,632
Scott: It's gonna be like a legendary VHS that like a few people would have a copy of yep But now it's on YouTube.

475
00:30:36,652 --> 00:30:37,139
Scott: ever can see it.

476
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,210
Rym: This is actually kind of amazing and not that many.

477
00:30:39,231 --> 00:30:39,894
Rym: This is only got 30,000 views.

478
00:30:39,914 --> 00:30:43,016
Scott: Yep I don't know what's up with that and 69 subscribers.

479
00:30:44,621 --> 00:30:45,747
Rym: I'll subscribe to Steve Peck.

480
00:30:45,968 --> 00:30:47,214
Rym: I hope he hasn't done anything bad.

481
00:30:47,235 --> 00:30:48,139
Scott: We'll find out.

482
00:30:48,881 --> 00:30:50,913
Rym: Comments are turned off on this too for some reason.

483
00:30:50,953 --> 00:30:55,520
Scott: It probably should be Surprise there hasn't been a copyright takedown from Warner Brothers.

484
00:30:56,581 --> 00:30:57,284
Rym: Maybe there has been.

485
00:30:57,465 --> 00:31:00,680
Rym: one of the things they can do is turn off comments on your videos find out and monetize them.

486
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,205
Rym: We'll see in a moment.

487
00:31:02,225 --> 00:31:04,313
Rym: The GeekNights book club book is the tale of Genji.

488
00:31:04,393 --> 00:31:04,875
Scott: I'm reading it.

489
00:31:05,316 --> 00:31:06,380
Scott: All right, no commute.

490
00:31:06,581 --> 00:31:07,607
Scott: So I got no commute.

491
00:31:07,667 --> 00:31:09,980
Scott: Does that mean less reading or home?

492
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:14,279
Scott: Saving on less between one and two hours a day?

493
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:22,680
Rym: The problem is it more reading but if I'm home and I have time saved I'm either making YouTube videos for GeekNights or I'm playing overwatch.

494
00:31:22,764 --> 00:31:29,929
Scott: Yeah I have been producing more content and playing more games and and I've been reading more comics but less Book and I see a lot of your board.

495
00:31:29,949 --> 00:31:32,020
Rym: There's like 20 people watching this live stream, right?

496
00:31:32,362 --> 00:31:34,894
Scott: People do and you got everybody's working from home.

497
00:31:35,095 --> 00:31:35,980
Scott: go make something.

498
00:31:36,841 --> 00:31:38,552
Rym: Yeah, we're making right now at least.

499
00:31:38,572 --> 00:31:39,679
Scott: Yeah, I'm making something right now.

500
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,643
Scott: Follow my example.

501
00:31:40,664 --> 00:31:44,880
Scott: if you like me so much and make something and stop watching and listening to something.

502
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,487
Rym: Why don't I retail of Genji now?

503
00:31:46,547 --> 00:31:49,459
Rym: because commuting and poop it at work for the two times I would read it.

504
00:31:49,901 --> 00:31:52,590
Scott: Maybe I should just do it whenever I poop period.

505
00:31:53,554 --> 00:31:54,497
Rym: Oh the home poop.

506
00:31:54,859 --> 00:31:58,691
Scott: Yeah Yeah, if I poop Kindle app only that's the rule.

507
00:31:58,711 --> 00:31:59,414
Scott: That's the new rule.

508
00:31:59,474 --> 00:32:00,738
Rym: All right, that's my new strategy.

509
00:32:00,758 --> 00:32:04,526
Scott: the new rule Clever if you poop you can.

510
00:32:04,727 --> 00:32:07,637
Scott: the only app you're allowed to open is an e-book reading app.

511
00:32:07,778 --> 00:32:09,343
Scott: Yep All right.

512
00:32:09,383 --> 00:32:10,527
Scott: That's a new rule.

513
00:32:10,607 --> 00:32:11,229
Rym: This is the way.

514
00:32:11,249 --> 00:32:11,891
Rym: All right.

515
00:32:12,353 --> 00:32:16,047
Rym: I Saw the whole Mandalorian and I love it.

516
00:32:16,288 --> 00:32:17,434
Rym: Okay, you should watch though.

517
00:32:17,454 --> 00:32:18,720
Rym: There's only four more episodes.

518
00:32:19,121 --> 00:32:19,864
Scott: I got it stuff to watch.

519
00:32:19,944 --> 00:32:23,195
Rym: All I'm saying is no, they do turn into plot stuff.

520
00:32:23,356 --> 00:32:24,520
Rym: It's not just more.

521
00:32:24,863 --> 00:32:25,429
Rym: Here's the curse.

522
00:32:25,449 --> 00:32:26,197
Scott: I'm sure they do.

523
00:32:26,831 --> 00:32:37,032
Rym: Yeah Anyway, otherwise, we do not have any conventions for a while Not just because of coronavirus, but because actually our next scheduled major convention.

524
00:32:37,052 --> 00:32:40,040
Rym: It was gonna be PAX West anyway.

525
00:32:40,684 --> 00:32:49,860
Scott: Yeah, so we'll see if PAX West happens Like it looks like 50/50 as a. yeah, but we'll see never bought a plane ticket so nerd and tie.

526
00:32:49,961 --> 00:32:54,840
Rym: It seems like they're gonna try to do an online Convention where they're gonna make a panel's track.

527
00:32:55,121 --> 00:33:01,329
Rym: But what they want is people who normally do panels at nerdy conventions Sign us up for any of those that exist.

528
00:33:01,389 --> 00:33:01,590
Rym: Yes.

529
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:04,260
Rym: They want to just do audio only because that's easier to start.

530
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:06,010
Rym: Okay, so I'm trying to figure out.

531
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:11,675
Rym: the problem is most of our panels We lied without the slides know like 40 40 games.

532
00:33:11,695 --> 00:33:12,077
Rym: You should play.

533
00:33:12,097 --> 00:33:12,820
Rym: it sounds easy, right?

534
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:16,399
Rym: We don't fucking say the name of the game half the time because the slide is up.

535
00:33:16,881 --> 00:33:18,045
Rym: So I'm looking for panels.

536
00:33:18,085 --> 00:33:19,810
Rym: we've done where the slides.

537
00:33:20,191 --> 00:33:26,740
Rym: it's okay for someone to just hear the audio and be able to look at The slides but I don't need they can't need to see the slide to understand what we're talking about.

538
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:31,500
Scott: I've also been thinking about doing this for a while even before everyone was sent home.

539
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:36,154
Scott: I'm not sure if I should actually say my idea because then it would be shit talking.

540
00:33:36,354 --> 00:33:38,060
Rym: No, but I'm not saying anything.

541
00:33:38,121 --> 00:33:39,179
Rym: I'm trying to work on right now.

542
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:45,394
Scott: No but the idea I've had for a while which you know, I guess has a chance of coming to fruition because it is lower effort than other ideas.

543
00:33:45,577 --> 00:33:49,009
Scott: is The thing we're good at is doing panels, right?

544
00:33:49,049 --> 00:33:49,250
Scott: Yep.

545
00:33:49,431 --> 00:33:54,728
Scott: So why not just make panels and Just do them for YouTube at home.

546
00:33:54,748 --> 00:34:00,150
Scott: Yeah, and no one has to approve or reject our idea meaning we can No one can tell me not to do that panel.

547
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:01,720
Scott: Yeah, I just come up with a panel.

548
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:03,368
Scott: It could be doesn't it be an hour.

549
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:04,052
Scott: It could be longer.

550
00:34:04,112 --> 00:34:04,776
Scott: It could be shorter.

551
00:34:04,816 --> 00:34:05,560
Scott: It could be any topic.

552
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:06,840
Scott: It'd be anything even better.

553
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:13,235
Rym: We can use the new YouTube live stream premier thing so we can do it with an online audience To have at least people reacting to it.

554
00:34:14,105 --> 00:34:21,060
Scott: Right, but I'm just saying like, you know I could just make some slides stand in front of the camera run the slides edit the slides into the video.

555
00:34:21,241 --> 00:34:21,864
Rym: Yep, right.

556
00:34:21,906 --> 00:34:25,810
Scott: I don't need to do it live and then Put it up and there you go.

557
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:26,594
Scott: I did and I could do it.

558
00:34:26,635 --> 00:34:27,500
Scott: For example, we did it.

559
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,446
Scott: We'll do a panel.

560
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:29,534
Rym: I want to do the one we did.

561
00:34:29,554 --> 00:34:30,460
Rym: we already have one panel.

562
00:34:30,541 --> 00:34:31,105
Rym: We did that.

563
00:34:31,487 --> 00:34:32,799
Rym: we've never videoed anywhere.

564
00:34:33,281 --> 00:34:41,699
Rym: I have a recording audio recording of it that I gave to the patreon patrons only with slides But at the point it like for example We'll do a panel like how to win at games.

565
00:34:42,382 --> 00:34:45,780
Scott: I could take like just one slide from that panel.

566
00:34:46,281 --> 00:34:49,871
Scott: Right, like one way to win at games and do like up.

567
00:34:49,891 --> 00:34:52,940
Scott: Oh, yeah, I could do like positional heuristic the panel.

568
00:34:53,042 --> 00:34:53,697
Scott: It's ten minutes.

569
00:34:53,949 --> 00:34:54,885
Scott: Yeah and that's the video.

570
00:34:55,126 --> 00:35:02,160
Rym: we can we can do all that also a Lot of those what you just described are the panels that we used to do as part of those triple threat panels.

571
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:07,980
Rym: We used to do a packs or we'd have three 20-minute panel ideas But we couldn't turn any one of them into an hour, right?

572
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,432
Rym: That's like the perfect kind of content to do like this is.

573
00:35:10,573 --> 00:35:12,563
Scott: this is a good idea I think.

574
00:35:12,584 --> 00:35:17,710
Rym: to start well also this we should do Competitive versus casual because we already wrote that panel.

575
00:35:17,791 --> 00:35:20,260
Rym: We just haven't done it except at magfest once.

576
00:35:22,761 --> 00:35:27,700
Scott: I also want to point out we've had this idea of doing videos of how to win it board games.

577
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,127
Rym: I saw someone seems to be trying to someone.

578
00:35:30,268 --> 00:35:34,643
Scott: an awesome group of people is already fucking doing it and I want to shout out To them.

579
00:35:34,663 --> 00:35:38,044
Scott: Let me just find out their name one sec Yep, and shoot me a link.

580
00:35:38,325 --> 00:35:40,312
Scott: It's show me how to win calm.

581
00:35:40,372 --> 00:35:42,740
Scott: Yeah, so go to show me how to win calm.

582
00:35:43,305 --> 00:35:49,107
Scott: They are making videos right Showing you how to win at board games.

583
00:35:49,167 --> 00:35:50,693
Scott: That is the idea that we had.

584
00:35:50,733 --> 00:35:52,279
Scott: they're doing it and executing on it.

585
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,734
Scott: Yeah ahead of us props to them.

586
00:35:55,136 --> 00:35:55,740
Scott: That's awesome.

587
00:35:55,901 --> 00:36:01,069
Rym: we might also do it but I think our Demographic because I feel like the games we're gonna focus on.

588
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:04,200
Rym: the problem is we can only actually do this for games.

589
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,668
Rym: We've played enough to grok.

590
00:36:06,948 --> 00:36:09,376
Rym: Yep, and in the modern era, it's hard.

591
00:36:09,396 --> 00:36:13,456
Rym: We can't play like Maria 40 times like we did Puerto Rico.

592
00:36:13,779 --> 00:36:14,957
Scott: Yeah But anyway, there it is.

593
00:36:15,562 --> 00:36:19,740
Scott: If you're looking for that content and waiting for our slow shit talking asses to they're moving faster.

594
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,144
Scott: Go someone else is already doing it.

595
00:36:21,184 --> 00:36:21,927
Scott: Go check them out.

596
00:36:22,027 --> 00:36:22,368
Scott: Yeah.

597
00:36:22,528 --> 00:36:22,809
Scott: Alright.

598
00:36:23,491 --> 00:36:26,280
Rym: Alright, so we're not talking about working from home.

599
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,467
Rym: Cuz you're all sick of that shit.

600
00:36:27,507 --> 00:36:29,981
Scott: Have you done two episodes on that in 2009?

601
00:36:29,981 --> 00:36:32,549
Scott: We did telecommuting and in 2018 late 2018 we did work from home.

602
00:36:36,462 --> 00:36:37,666
Scott: So we're not doing that again.

603
00:36:38,047 --> 00:36:39,371
Scott: No matter how relevant it is.

604
00:36:39,391 --> 00:36:41,116
Scott: Go listen to the old episodes.

605
00:36:41,437 --> 00:36:42,120
Scott: They're up there.

606
00:36:42,481 --> 00:36:45,375
Rym: So when you're done looking at the bad screen, you're stuck at home.

607
00:36:45,395 --> 00:36:46,300
Rym: You're working from home.

608
00:36:46,581 --> 00:36:48,031
Rym: You've looked at the bad screen all day.

609
00:36:48,051 --> 00:36:48,494
Rym: Yep.

610
00:36:48,514 --> 00:36:49,500
Scott: You have two screens at home.

611
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:53,014
Scott: Now you had a bad one and a good one and you by 45 rolls around.

612
00:36:53,034 --> 00:36:55,709
Scott: you close the bad screen For at a 40 I turn off the bad screen.

613
00:36:57,982 --> 00:37:00,721
Rym: But you don't always want to just look at the good screen Like.

614
00:37:00,761 --> 00:37:04,018
Rym: sometimes you want to like go hang out with your friends or like do the stuff you normally?

615
00:37:04,038 --> 00:37:07,180
Scott: yeah Can't because it's a bad time.

616
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:10,940
Rym: So now you've got to not work from home with a good screen.

617
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,246
Rym: You have a good screen still

618
00:37:12,467 --> 00:37:29,340
Scott: at home and you have to do not work things Right, and if you're not just a completely introverted person who's completely happy just hiding in your bed doing reading a book or playing Video games, how do you gonna replace your outside large social gathering biz?

619
00:37:30,382 --> 00:37:37,749
Rym: When you're stuck in the house, yep Now I do know a lot of a lot of introverted people online and pointed out that This is not nearly as hard for some people as this for others.

620
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:41,762
Rym: obviously and very extroverted people are having a very hard time with This right now.

621
00:37:41,863 --> 00:37:46,702
Rym: Oh, yeah, I'm even getting antsy like I gotta hang out like I just get antsy cuz I didn't leave the house until.

622
00:37:46,903 --> 00:37:49,011
Scott: oh, I didn't leave that until now.

623
00:37:49,393 --> 00:38:01,080
Scott: I've been in my house since When I guess since oh god, oh no since I went to the restaurant after the food fell on the floor We went outside to pick up essentials from the grocery store.

624
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:04,604
Scott: I know the grocery on the way home, then we go back in the home Yep, and we won't.

625
00:38:04,624 --> 00:38:07,773
Rym: we go for a walk every day around lunchtime because we're both working from home.

626
00:38:07,793 --> 00:38:08,796
Scott: I'm gonna do biking.

627
00:38:09,137 --> 00:38:17,170
Rym: Yep, but So if you're trapped inside and going crazy Like how do you how do you do it in the modern era?

628
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:24,639
Rym: and the good news is it's both harder and easier now Than it's ever been but we've lost a lot of the even better ways that used to exist.

629
00:38:25,841 --> 00:38:27,719
Rym: So it's kind of fractured now.

630
00:38:27,941 --> 00:38:36,914
Rym: And I think I want to focus on the things that actually work today and not try to get into like the history like IRC is dead unless you're crazy like don't pretend the technologist man.

631
00:38:36,954 --> 00:38:37,997
Scott: The point is chat rooms.

632
00:38:38,038 --> 00:38:38,760
Scott: Don't really do it?

633
00:38:38,961 --> 00:38:41,310
Scott: No, I'm or even when I'm going out of the house.

634
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:42,695
Scott: I'm already in a chat rooms all day.

635
00:38:42,796 --> 00:38:46,140
Scott: Yeah, like winter doesn't do it I'm already tweeting all day when I'm going out of house.

636
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:55,460
Rym: It doesn't help like the only difference between me at work in the bed screen and me at home in the good screen Is that I'm not checking my discords and all my other things like constantly at work because I'm busy, right?

637
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,420
Rym: But I still like see them right?

638
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:02,100
Scott: So what you got to do is you got to replace, you know, your large social gathering, right?

639
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:06,941
Scott: So one thing you can do is it's still okay to have a few people over your house That's not.

640
00:39:06,962 --> 00:39:11,817
Rym: if that's not really yeah read all the literature online like to households that are themselves.

641
00:39:11,837 --> 00:39:12,840
Scott: I came over to this house.

642
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:22,719
Rym: Yep, quarantining can merge together and share that risk within their local group But like don't don't do that with too many people you can read online like the best practices for all this time, right?

643
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:28,240
Scott: But uh, so you could get some board games going on that way, but number one board games.

644
00:39:28,581 --> 00:39:30,929
Rym: Tabletop simulator is pretty fucking good.

645
00:39:30,949 --> 00:39:32,013
Rym: Yeah works.

646
00:39:32,314 --> 00:39:32,976
Rym: It's good enough.

647
00:39:33,016 --> 00:39:37,139
Scott: I mean, it's not good But if you're got no other choice, it's gonna save you.

648
00:39:37,327 --> 00:39:38,218
Rym: Yeah Cuz here's the deal.

649
00:39:38,601 --> 00:39:49,020
Rym: tabletop simulator is basically a fixed physics engine with a bunch of like Boardgame specific things built in to make it easy to make tabletop games and it pretty much just works.

650
00:39:50,282 --> 00:39:51,510
Scott: And the interface is really bad.

651
00:39:51,551 --> 00:39:54,980
Scott: It's hard to figure out how to get it started But once it started and you're connected then you're good.

652
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,285
Rym: It does kind of just work.

653
00:39:56,586 --> 00:40:02,557
Rym: it partly depends on you got to go find like games people have made Often of dubious legality the Steam Workshop.

654
00:40:02,718 --> 00:40:07,654
Rym: Yep But the one thing I'll say is if you happen to have a VR headset it.

655
00:40:07,734 --> 00:40:16,948
Rym: actually this is the one time Like the only time the UX in VR is way better than the UX on a desktop Like it.

656
00:40:17,029 --> 00:40:21,734
Scott: literally like you reach out You don't have to know what button to press to grab or put or want to roll some dice.

657
00:40:21,955 --> 00:40:23,644
Rym: grab them throw them They roll.

658
00:40:23,826 --> 00:40:24,894
Rym: Yeah, like it just works.

659
00:40:24,915 --> 00:40:25,925
Rym: want to play a card Where is it?

660
00:40:25,945 --> 00:40:27,040
Scott: How do you roll dice with the mouse?

661
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:29,051
Scott: Like click on the dice and then I move.

662
00:40:29,132 --> 00:40:30,600
Scott: it's like you got to figure it out the buttons.

663
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:30,901
Scott: But

664
00:40:30,942 --> 00:40:41,743
Rym: my real advice is if you have a friend who's kind of into tabletop simulator Get them to teach all your friends how to use it and like play a few games just to learn like you'll fuck it Up a few times

665
00:40:41,843 --> 00:40:45,879
Scott: right find someone who is gonna take the lead and be like, alright, I'm running this.

666
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:52,420
Scott: Yep, right and then make it as easy as possible because you need these other people who are not say as technically savvy.

667
00:40:52,522 --> 00:40:53,340
Scott: This is the Monday show.

668
00:40:53,902 --> 00:41:07,480
Scott: You have to be the one the Monday GeekNights listener who has not taken my advice to go do something else With your technical skills, you have to set it up and make it as easy as humanly possible For everyone else to get in on it in order to make it happen.

669
00:41:07,521 --> 00:41:10,909
Rym: You don't it won't happen Even if you're a jerk and you hate your friends like.

670
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:12,395
Rym: this is enlightened self-interest.

671
00:41:12,576 --> 00:41:13,620
Rym: Imagine a board game person.

672
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:14,607
Rym: You love train games.

673
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:16,280
Rym: No one around you loves train games.

674
00:41:16,581 --> 00:41:20,960
Rym: You have a vested interest in making people around you want to play train games with you.

675
00:41:21,242 --> 00:41:23,439
Rym: It's the same thing if you're that TTS person.

676
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:29,880
Rym: Make TTS easy for your friends and they will totally do it with you and strike now while the iron's hot, right?

677
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,420
Scott: So now you got to think about the other things that you're doing at home, right?

678
00:41:33,781 --> 00:41:38,620
Scott: Find ways to digitally connect with other people doing the same thing, right?

679
00:41:38,961 --> 00:41:43,780
Scott: So if you're you know, you're introverted staying inside the house, you're reading a book.

680
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,851
Scott: Don't just read the book and put it on the shelf.

681
00:41:47,212 --> 00:41:48,739
Scott: find other people who read in the book.

682
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:49,463
Scott: Yeah, right.

683
00:41:49,745 --> 00:41:52,320
Scott: Maybe make a little book club action going on.

684
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,858
Scott: I'll just maybe that you know have a little you know.

685
00:41:55,180 --> 00:42:05,640
Scott: Be like put on your schedule like use your online schedule with your friends and be like, alright Everyone's working at home until 5 At 6 o'clock today or 7 after dinner.

686
00:42:06,781 --> 00:42:10,273
Scott: We're gonna discuss chapters 1 & 2 of the book right?

687
00:42:10,293 --> 00:42:12,279
Scott: So now people actually feel obligated to read it.

688
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:15,635
Scott: They'll do it while they're on their Kindle app obligate on their toilet.

689
00:42:15,856 --> 00:42:16,740
Scott: They'll read the chapter.

690
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,184
Rym: This works real well with.

691
00:42:18,204 --> 00:42:19,970
Scott: they're not allowed to do anything else.

692
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:26,540
Rym: any TV show you could watch like anything like you want to rewatch TNG just find other friends who will also want to watch.

693
00:42:26,721 --> 00:42:36,860
Scott: Make other people consume the same media at the same time so that you can discuss With them intentionally right so you're not sort of trapped in your own media landscape now.

694
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:42,000
Scott: And also a lot of things these days have features where you can watch together.

695
00:42:42,141 --> 00:42:46,400
Scott: We're like, you'll all be watching at the same time while you have a voice chat open, right?

696
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:46,902
Rym: I'm trying.

697
00:42:46,942 --> 00:42:51,180
Scott: so it was like it's like you're watching in the same room, even though you're watching in faraway rooms.

698
00:42:51,260 --> 00:43:09,260
Rym: So I'm trying a bunch of those out to figure out which ones kind of work the best and have the least like dodginess to Them yeah, and we'll post in the forum like some recommendations once I try them out, but I found one that was kind of crazy Totally illegal, but I was in VR chat on Sunday and someone made a room that was called the anime hangout room.

699
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,820
Scott: They made it recently and they're just showing anime.

700
00:43:11,043 --> 00:43:24,165
Rym: so if you go into this room it's like an apartment and you can just kind of hang around in the room with this big screen on the wall and They have a library of bootleg anime full seasons of like recent stuff And you can just start it.

701
00:43:24,446 --> 00:43:30,727
Rym: so you and like 20 people can hang out in VR chat watching an anime But in a room interacting hmm.

702
00:43:30,888 --> 00:43:33,616
Rym: It's actually pretty cool and kind of just works like.

703
00:43:33,917 --> 00:43:34,900
Scott: I don't see why that wouldn't work.

704
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:45,856
Rym: I hung out with some nerds, and I watched like 10 minutes of attack on Titan and it was weirdly Satisfying because it's not the same as like we're watching the show and then we talk about it.

705
00:43:45,916 --> 00:43:46,780
Rym: that serves one need.

706
00:43:47,162 --> 00:44:02,996
Rym: But you know that feeling of like you've got something on the TV but you're also kind of just hanging out and like riffing off each other like in person because like two people can walk to the back of the room and kind of talk and That talking is really quiet or even inaudible to people who are closer to the TV.

707
00:44:03,056 --> 00:44:10,399
Rym: because it's all proximity based VR chat is obviously only an option for people who have money or happen to already have a bunch of VR shit set up.

708
00:44:10,419 --> 00:44:12,265
Scott: you Can do VR chat with just your computer?

709
00:44:12,305 --> 00:44:16,098
Rym: Yeah, the VR chat desktop client actually is pretty good.

710
00:44:16,118 --> 00:44:16,820
Scott: Yeah, it works.

711
00:44:16,921 --> 00:44:18,080
Scott: I used it one time yeah.

712
00:44:18,421 --> 00:44:22,376
Rym: So I'm gonna explore setting up some hangout times in VR chat for people who want to hang out.

713
00:44:22,637 --> 00:44:40,900
Rym: hmm But basically find the tools that enable these things like tabletop simulator VR chat whatever of the ten watch anime with my friends in a semi-legal streaming manner and Use them, but like Scott said you have to be don't be the bystander you have to be the person who facilitates.

714
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,308
Rym: Yeah, make it happen for your friends.

715
00:44:43,629 --> 00:44:48,468
Scott: one person has to take that on and make it happen right and all those since you Have you know if you're working from home?

716
00:44:48,508 --> 00:44:50,096
Scott: You'll have more spare time.

717
00:44:50,177 --> 00:44:52,456
Scott: at least for me It's like one to two hours a day.

718
00:44:52,476 --> 00:44:55,276
Rym: yeah for me I don't because my commute is like eight minutes.

719
00:44:55,639 --> 00:44:58,226
Scott: well I mean like if I bike to work It's what 40 something.

720
00:44:58,266 --> 00:45:02,811
Rym: yeah, it's so 40 minutes times to 80 minute But if I bike to work it takes 12 minutes.

721
00:45:02,932 --> 00:45:04,160
Rym: like I'm not really saving a lot of time.

722
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:04,983
Scott: I save a lot of time.

723
00:45:05,163 --> 00:45:06,287
Rym: Emily walks to us.

724
00:45:06,307 --> 00:45:07,572
Scott: There's also time saved.

725
00:45:07,853 --> 00:45:09,739
Scott: not taking a shower not getting.

726
00:45:11,026 --> 00:45:13,220
Rym: You don't dress or take showers when you work from home.

727
00:45:13,381 --> 00:45:16,879
Scott: I put clothes on right before coming here, and I haven't showered in two or three days.

728
00:45:17,783 --> 00:45:19,180
Rym: So I did not shower this morning.

729
00:45:19,824 --> 00:45:20,548
Scott: Do I smell bad?

730
00:45:20,588 --> 00:45:22,500
Rym: you know I'm not gonna pretend I showered this morning.

731
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:23,044
Scott: I'm gonna see.

732
00:45:23,064 --> 00:45:24,657
Scott: I'm gonna actually shave and shower when I get home to.

733
00:45:24,697 --> 00:45:26,995
Rym: in fact I was my plan because I was working all day.

734
00:45:27,015 --> 00:45:27,660
Scott: I didn't want to shower.

735
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:31,680
Scott: I was I would have showered this morning cuz I felt dirty, but I was gonna shave my head tonight.

736
00:45:31,761 --> 00:45:36,049
Rym: So I still shower once a day But I don't have to shower right before work like normal.

737
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:38,016
Rym: exactly the morning routine is a lot easier.

738
00:45:38,036 --> 00:45:40,258
Scott: a lot of time is saved Here and there yeah.

739
00:45:41,121 --> 00:45:47,562
Scott: And with that save time all those sort of higher effort things now become Doable.

740
00:45:47,723 --> 00:45:52,300
Scott: yeah, it's sort of like ah that board game that takes a lot of time to set up.

741
00:45:52,601 --> 00:45:58,886
Rym: I got time to set it up before people join TTS to play it with me right or that thing I want to cook for dinner.

742
00:45:58,906 --> 00:46:01,479
Scott: that takes an hour instead of 30 minutes.

743
00:46:01,943 --> 00:46:05,266
Rym: Oh, I can soak the beans this morning And they'll be ready when I want to you.

744
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:08,740
Scott: I can marinate the meat as soon as I wake up and cook it for dinner.

745
00:46:08,982 --> 00:46:12,809
Rym: Right I can count the number of times I've marinated meat for the appropriate amount of time.

746
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:16,784
Scott: on one hand right so I mean mostly for games But any other sort of.

747
00:46:16,804 --> 00:46:22,940
Scott: you know digital social thing that requires an advanced setup is now doable.

748
00:46:23,083 --> 00:46:24,524
Rym: Yep, right But I really are.

749
00:46:24,544 --> 00:46:30,572
Scott: you just have to be the one to do it all the hard parts and make it easy for the other People because they're not going to be able to do it and join it.

750
00:46:30,753 --> 00:46:33,679
Rym: yep, and even more It's not even if they're not capable of it.

751
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:34,367
Rym: It's that you know.

752
00:46:34,407 --> 00:46:35,600
Rym: there's sort of a by much effort.

753
00:46:35,921 --> 00:46:38,409
Rym: But the bystander effect like if someone's hurt in a crowd.

754
00:46:38,469 --> 00:46:41,600
Rym: a lot of people will agree that person needs help and will call for.

755
00:46:42,122 --> 00:46:48,140
Rym: But if the whole crowd is just doing that it's easy for no one to actually call 9-1-1 like that's a thing that happens.

756
00:46:48,834 --> 00:46:55,844
Scott: so This advice if I if I see a thing whenever I see a thing like that going on It's like has anyone call 9-1-1.

757
00:46:55,884 --> 00:46:56,145
Scott: I go.

758
00:46:56,266 --> 00:46:58,795
Scott: I'm like you call 9-1-1 right.

759
00:46:58,855 --> 00:47:07,079
Scott: It's like as soon as I Gotta I'll often like bike past an accident of some kind, but that's only after I verified.

760
00:47:07,099 --> 00:47:10,053
Scott: okay This is definitely taking care of I am not needed.

761
00:47:10,133 --> 00:47:13,129
Scott: if it's not taking care of yet Yeah, then I stop and take care of it.

762
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:24,729
Rym: Yep, even if there's like a pile of people I just I've stopped and verify and make sure yeah has someone at least called 9-1-1 like so It's not to that direness for social interactions yet.

763
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:26,414
Rym: Maybe if we're stuck like this for six months.

764
00:47:26,434 --> 00:47:27,397
Rym: It'll get a little more dire.

765
00:47:27,417 --> 00:47:31,126
Rym: but Don't fall prey to the bystander effect.

766
00:47:31,207 --> 00:47:38,236
Rym: if you want this to happen and you see all your friends also wanted to happen like you're listening To this now just be the one and make it happen even if it's low effort.

767
00:47:38,277 --> 00:47:38,417
Rym: like.

768
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:45,329
Rym: Discord is a great tool because discord streaming we talked about it the other day But now it's a good point to talking about it again.

769
00:47:45,832 --> 00:47:46,980
Rym: It just fucking works.

770
00:47:47,301 --> 00:47:49,694
Scott: Yeah, and it doesn't require fancy set up of OBS.

771
00:47:49,714 --> 00:47:50,880
Scott: You just push a button and it goes.

772
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:55,373
Rym: Yep If you already and if you're if the thing you're streaming does desktop audio it just works.

773
00:47:55,634 --> 00:48:01,400
Rym: if you already can talk to people on Discord then that same talking setup just transfers to the stream.

774
00:48:01,968 --> 00:48:02,760
Rym: Like it's brilliant.

775
00:48:04,042 --> 00:48:05,287
Rym: Don't worry about privacy.

776
00:48:05,368 --> 00:48:07,900
Rym: It'll only stream to the people in your discord in that channel.

777
00:48:08,061 --> 00:48:10,900
Scott: There are other technologies though that you shouldn't discount right?

778
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:21,640
Scott: So for example, I read a story just today or yesterday that Japanese elementary school held their graduation in Minecraft because they couldn't hold it anywhere else, right?

779
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:26,296
Scott: So I guess they made a school auditorium in Minecraft and they all had.

780
00:48:26,336 --> 00:48:31,627
Scott: there was like a you know A green monster whatever the creeper on stage Graduating right.

781
00:48:31,747 --> 00:48:38,960
Scott: and I think what the lessons here are a Consider all possible technologies, you know software is that let people get together.

782
00:48:39,141 --> 00:48:41,654
Scott: Yeah that people already have and know how to use and are easy.

783
00:48:42,036 --> 00:48:47,031
Scott: But also Any event that is being canceled, right?

784
00:48:47,311 --> 00:48:51,870
Scott: You should find a way to replace it digitally Yep, even if you can't replace it fully.

785
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:53,480
Rym: It's definitely give me an air sats version of that.

786
00:48:53,600 --> 00:49:06,140
Scott: I know right but whatever that way it's like, you know, if you don't have just use that thing, you know even if the replacement event is Basically not even remotely close to the actual event.

787
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:06,843
Scott: it's replacing.

788
00:49:07,465 --> 00:49:17,680
Scott: use the existence of the original real world canceled event as The seed to actually plan and execute a replacement thing.

789
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:20,920
Scott: So for example, right hockey's not happening, right?

790
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:24,898
Scott: I'm seeing people in the hockey community doing two things so far.

791
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:29,338
Scott: one They're getting together and playing the remainder of the season in NHL.

792
00:49:29,921 --> 00:49:31,809
Rym: Yeah, the video is gonna bring that up.

793
00:49:31,849 --> 00:49:34,420
Rym: if you didn't bring that up right Emily showed me that this morning.

794
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:34,661
Rym: they're.

795
00:49:34,802 --> 00:49:45,589
Scott: also there's another group of people who are Simulating the rest of the season with spreadsheets game by game as they happen And then talking about him as if they happen.

796
00:49:45,709 --> 00:49:49,020
Scott: Yep, and even fantasy sports in them as if they had right.

797
00:49:50,758 --> 00:49:51,342
Scott: So That's right.

798
00:49:51,383 --> 00:49:52,066
Scott: They're using the.

799
00:49:52,347 --> 00:49:55,100
Scott: the games no longer exist the real ones.

800
00:49:55,381 --> 00:50:00,827
Scott: They're just taking that seed of the thing that was canceled to Instigate a replacement thing.

801
00:50:00,907 --> 00:50:01,509
Scott: Yep, right.

802
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:04,880
Scott: So if you had a thing that was happening in your life, it could have been anything.

803
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:08,020
Scott: It could have been a major event like a wedding or apartments.

804
00:50:08,241 --> 00:50:11,900
Rym: It's got a minor thing like your monthly dinner with the extended family, right?

805
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:17,978
Scott: So whatever thing you had that was canceled replace that thing with a digital version of the thing.

806
00:50:17,998 --> 00:50:24,900
Scott: Yep So or something that is adjacent to that thing close get as close as do something that counts it.

807
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,366
Scott: But anime Boston was canceled.

808
00:50:26,808 --> 00:50:27,391
Scott: do that.

809
00:50:27,451 --> 00:50:28,657
Scott: Just get some anime panels.

810
00:50:28,697 --> 00:50:29,320
Scott: post them online.

811
00:50:29,661 --> 00:50:30,987
Scott: What I see?

812
00:50:31,047 --> 00:50:32,433
Scott: artists alleys all over.

813
00:50:32,795 --> 00:50:33,920
Scott: people are going on Twitter.

814
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:35,642
Scott: How can their artists alley emerge?

815
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:38,787
Scott: David Peterson who can't go to the mouse guard artist?

816
00:50:38,847 --> 00:50:43,678
Scott: Yeah, he can't go to Was a Seattle Emerald City comic-con.

817
00:50:43,718 --> 00:50:47,480
Scott: Yep He's being twitch streaming and selling all kinds of merch and all kinds of biz.

818
00:50:47,581 --> 00:50:53,355
Scott: it's basically like he has an Artist alley booth running of him on his twitch channel.

819
00:50:53,677 --> 00:50:54,420
Scott: go check him out.

820
00:50:54,581 --> 00:50:55,186
Scott: And so many are.

821
00:50:55,226 --> 00:50:56,759
Rym: the artists are doing the same, but here's the key.

822
00:50:57,201 --> 00:51:05,875
Rym: You do don't feel like you have to be productive in these endeavors Like we're like we're gonna do a bunch of social stuff, but we're also aiming toward like.

823
00:51:06,176 --> 00:51:07,060
Rym: it doesn't be productive.

824
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:15,408
Rym: It's just replacing hanging out that you've lost But like if you make this hanging out work just for like you and for friends hanging out Just hanging out.

825
00:51:15,448 --> 00:51:17,220
Rym: Yeah, I mean like.

826
00:51:17,982 --> 00:51:18,745
Rym: We always talk a lot.

827
00:51:18,805 --> 00:51:29,373
Rym: if we had tried to do this earlier in our lives like while we were still at RIT We'd probably more successful now, but we probably couldn't have made it Would we if we didn't be more successful in 15 years?

828
00:51:29,393 --> 00:51:30,639
Scott: We're getting more successful in 20 years.

829
00:51:31,021 --> 00:51:34,422
Scott: I think that you're saying five years from now will be more successful I think.

830
00:51:34,442 --> 00:51:38,660
Rym: I think what I'm saying is that there was a time when the iron was hotter to strike on some of this stuff.

831
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:48,710
Scott: Maybe but if we had tried pretty sure we've been there every time the pad cast iron has been struck To do anything serious at RIT.

832
00:51:48,971 --> 00:51:52,420
Rym: instead of wasting all that time we could never have made anything we've ever made.

833
00:51:52,661 --> 00:51:55,919
Rym: The only reason we can make any of this is because we wasted all that time at RIT.

834
00:51:56,322 --> 00:51:58,093
Rym: That wasted time is what made me who I am.

835
00:51:58,113 --> 00:52:02,610
Scott: Yeah, we would not Times and learned how to talk about board game.

836
00:52:02,650 --> 00:52:07,529
Rym: Yeah, but I mean I say wasted but it's not wasted It's that's what I played.

837
00:52:07,569 --> 00:52:09,840
Scott: battle broken into a conference room to play a battle tag.

838
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:14,060
Scott: When would I have ever had been able to tell a story about breaking to a conference room to play battle day?

839
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:19,440
Rym: Yeah, but no we would have been like, you know, our friends were like yo building sevens unlock.

840
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:22,920
Rym: We're gonna play battle tech and we're like, no, no, no, we got to work on our podcast.

841
00:52:25,765 --> 00:52:27,658
Rym: So, uh But yeah, the tools are there.

842
00:52:28,221 --> 00:52:34,380
Rym: I wonder what do we do about old people and old friends like not like people who can't use this stuff?

843
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:38,620
Rym: Well, I think you there are still ways like how do you how do you if those bridge that divide also?

844
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:44,566
Scott: So, you know if someone's not super connected, right and you want to connect with them Maybe your parents or something, right?

845
00:52:45,087 --> 00:52:48,720
Scott: It's like you sort of have to like I said make it easy for them, right?

846
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:52,792
Scott: So there are things they already have that they're likely not using.

847
00:52:52,812 --> 00:53:00,200
Scott: you just have to because hopefully They're bored or alone enough that you can instigate them into using them, right?

848
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:09,559
Scott: So maybe instead of calling your parents FaceTime if they got on right Maybe you know, it's like maybe they got an Apple TV.

849
00:53:10,083 --> 00:53:17,338
Scott: I'm sure there's some Apple TV thing you can do that You just never bothered to do some feature in there to connect with them watch.

850
00:53:17,418 --> 00:53:17,760
Scott: I don't know.

851
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:19,566
Scott: I have never used an Apple TV in what I know.

852
00:53:19,827 --> 00:53:33,520
Scott: Yeah, right, but whatever technology they've already got set up Right you go through the effort smart Monday listener technology person and figure out what they can already do that They're not doing right and do as much of it.

853
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:37,660
Scott: You can on your end to get the other person in from their end, right?

854
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:46,375
Scott: The best thing would be to do is I mean ideally you can set something up where you can send them a link to click On in a young man, right and the link will do everything.

855
00:53:46,857 --> 00:53:48,979
Rym: and honestly You might just have to take it where you can get it.

856
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:56,400
Rym: Like you might end up having to make an SMS group chat with like all your relatives who don't understand how anything works.

857
00:53:56,721 --> 00:54:02,840
Rym: Mm-hmm, that might be annoying but it will probably fill at least some of that social gap your head.

858
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:04,107
Scott: Well, I mean for example, right?

859
00:54:04,167 --> 00:54:10,340
Scott: It's like maybe your parents are not cool They're not gonna get on a discord or even a Twitter, right?

860
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:11,524
Scott: Maybe but they're probably all.

861
00:54:11,564 --> 00:54:13,834
Rym: my mom were like watches these streams and is on Twitter.

862
00:54:13,854 --> 00:54:14,637
Rym: Okay.

863
00:54:14,657 --> 00:54:17,888
Scott: Hi Rose mom Yeah, but your parents probably on Facebook.

864
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,094
Scott: Grandma's probably on Facebook, right?

865
00:54:20,174 --> 00:54:21,357
Rym: I don't advocate using Facebook.

866
00:54:21,378 --> 00:54:22,180
Rym: Just delete that account.

867
00:54:22,401 --> 00:54:23,365
Scott: I'm saying they're there.

868
00:54:23,786 --> 00:54:26,960
Scott: you could go and figure out how to stream on Facebook and they'll fucking see it.

869
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:28,045
Scott: No, they will.

870
00:54:28,266 --> 00:54:34,167
Scott: so there you can go, you know go to where they are All right, I hunger up.
