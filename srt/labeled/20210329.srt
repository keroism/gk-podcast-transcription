1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,367
Rym: It's Monday, March 29th, 2021.

2
00:00:09,367 --> 00:00:09,548
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:13,440
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,024
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,044 --> 00:00:20,200
Rym: Tonight we are talking about multi-factor authentication, but actually some of the details of that.

6
00:00:21,582 --> 00:00:22,618
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:24,681 --> 00:00:29,880
Scott: Alright, so it's Passover, and I guess, you know, there's no SADER action going on.

8
00:00:31,021 --> 00:00:36,700
Scott: People were making pretty good Passover mashups between, like, the boat and the pandemic, right?

9
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,739
Scott: Because, you know, the pandemic kind of started, you know, around Passover-ish last year, right?

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:49,767
Scott: So, you know, there weren't too many combo jokes, but now it's, like, you know, someone had a really good tweet, like, "Yeah, wear a mask.

11
00:00:49,868 --> 00:00:50,916
Scott: Confuse the angel of

12
00:00:50,976 --> 00:00:51,218
Scott: death.".

13
00:00:55,244 --> 00:00:59,240
Rym: It's still weird to think it's been a year since we went into this whole lockdown.

14
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,814
Scott: Yeah, so there's this thing called soup nuts.

15
00:01:02,834 --> 00:01:03,860
Scott: I don't know if you know about these.

16
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,379
Scott: Do you ever eat the soup nut?

17
00:01:05,522 --> 00:01:06,218
Rym: I know about the soup nut.

18
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:07,943
Scott: Yeah, okay, the soup nut.

19
00:01:07,963 --> 00:01:12,137
Scott: It's basically a Jewish kosher for Passover oyster cracker.

20
00:01:12,177 --> 00:01:14,004
Scott: that's way less salty, but it's like a poof.

21
00:01:14,124 --> 00:01:18,040
Scott: It's like a little ball, and it floats in the soup, and it absorbs the soup, and it tastes good.

22
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:18,843
Rym: They're real good.

23
00:01:18,864 --> 00:01:21,059
Rym: In fact, we used to use them kind of quite a bit at RIT.

24
00:01:22,021 --> 00:01:23,306
Scott: Yeah, it's hard to get them.

25
00:01:23,809 --> 00:01:25,135
Scott: I was able to get some, though.

26
00:01:25,356 --> 00:01:26,240
Scott: My mom sent me some.

27
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:36,159
Scott: So I had to make some soup to put them in, so I made some soup, and something disappointing happened is I think I put too much water, and we have way too much soup, and it tastes a little bit watery.

28
00:01:36,701 --> 00:01:37,690
Rym: Uh, just boil it down.

29
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,639
Rym: Just let it simmer for a while.

30
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:39,843
Scott: I'm gonna go.

31
00:01:39,883 --> 00:01:44,060
Scott: What I'm gonna do is not only am I gonna boil it again, I'm gonna add a couple of cubes.

32
00:01:45,221 --> 00:01:46,328
Rym: Ah, that's the prostrat.

33
00:01:46,449 --> 00:01:48,180
Rym: Then you'll just have way too much soup.

34
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,920
Scott: So I have a giant tub of soup that I'm sure—and also I tried to add MSG to see if I could.

35
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:57,055
Scott: It's not very Jewish, but I was seeing if it would help out.

36
00:01:58,382 --> 00:02:00,412
Scott: Um, I can't taste the difference.

37
00:02:00,513 --> 00:02:01,216
Scott: Yeah, at least not yet.

38
00:02:01,257 --> 00:02:01,880
Scott: Maybe it needs more.

39
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:04,208
Scott: Anyway, we're going with the cubes.

40
00:02:04,248 --> 00:02:06,900
Scott: I'm probably gonna get some at the grocery, and then I'll heat it up again.

41
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:10,102
Scott: I got a huge bucket of it, so if you want soup— Yeah, it's funny.

42
00:02:10,142 --> 00:02:14,147
Rym: I was talking to some co-workers recently about, like, the other day just about, "Oh, like, Passover's coming up,".

43
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:18,295
Rym: and they were just having a conversation, and one of them's like, "Well, you know, Passover's gonna suck this year,".

44
00:02:18,315 --> 00:02:21,735
Rym: and then the one guy's like, "Yeah, at least I can Zoom my relatives, so we'll still, like, do a thing,".

45
00:02:21,755 --> 00:02:25,155
Rym: and then the first one's like, "Yeah, I can't actually start a Zoom during all

46
00:02:25,195 --> 00:02:25,396
Rym: that.".

47
00:02:28,741 --> 00:02:29,940
Rym: Anyway— I want some matzo ball soup.

48
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:31,863
Scott: Well, come on and get some.

49
00:02:31,903 --> 00:02:36,966
Scott: I'll give you a, you know, a Chinese takeout container-sized— Oh, I got it.

50
00:02:37,007 --> 00:02:39,124
Rym: We still have, like, a giant— Add your own wontons.

51
00:02:39,164 --> 00:02:49,459
Scott: I'm sure wontons, even though those are super not kosher, would, you know, even—and there's pork inside—if you put them in the chicken soup, and it was not watery like the one I made, it would probably taste very good.

52
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,680
Rym: That would be a pretty good—make a fusion restaurant around that concept.

53
00:02:53,424 --> 00:02:54,812
Scott: Also, I made matzo balls from the mix.

54
00:02:54,893 --> 00:02:56,160
Scott: Matzo balls from the mix are always good.

55
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,000
Scott: You don't need to make matzo balls from scratch.

56
00:03:00,701 --> 00:03:05,599
Scott: Also, I made—the store was out of the regular matzo ball mix.

57
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:12,258
Scott: I got to get the low-sodium matzo ball mix, but I just boiled the matzo balls in salt water so they worked out just fine.

58
00:03:13,445 --> 00:03:14,000
Scott: Doesn't matter.

59
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,900
Scott: I guess other tiny open-y bit, right?

60
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,239
Scott: My work, you know, has interns once in a while, right?

61
00:03:20,965 --> 00:03:22,499
Scott: I guess per semester or whatever.

62
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:36,683
Scott: And there's someone who runs that program, and apparently what they were do— you know, they've had these sort of Q&A things where, you know, they'll schedule a little Q&A for the interns to come and, like, you know, someone from the company will say, "This is me.

63
00:03:36,964 --> 00:03:37,867
Scott: This is what I do.

64
00:03:38,188 --> 00:03:39,433
Scott: This is my career path.

65
00:03:39,915 --> 00:03:41,160
Scott: Ask me questions," right?

66
00:03:42,463 --> 00:03:44,700
Scott: And it was always the same people over and over.

67
00:03:45,201 --> 00:03:46,446
Scott: Like, they're open to the whole company.

68
00:03:46,486 --> 00:03:52,812
Scott: It's not just for interns, but it's— You know, it's beneficial.

69
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:53,879
Scott: So, you know, I went a few times.

70
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,768
Scott: They changed it recently.

71
00:03:56,788 --> 00:04:01,817
Scott: A few months ago, they're like, "We encourage all employees to

72
00:04:01,897 --> 00:04:02,259
Scott: participate.".

73
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,440
Scott: They wanted anyone to do it, right, instead of the same people over and over again.

74
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,038
Scott: So I'm like, "Well, you know, they're encouraging everyone to do

75
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:10,139
Scott: it.".

76
00:04:10,582 --> 00:04:12,839
Scott: I don't think I've ever seen anyone from my team do it.

77
00:04:13,061 --> 00:04:22,170
Scott: It's kind of weird for someone on my team to do it because we're like a software engineering team and not—it's a music company, so I thought the interns, what do they care about software engineering?

78
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,660
Scott: They care about music publishing, right?

79
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,003
Scott: I don't know.

80
00:04:24,023 --> 00:04:25,639
Scott: But they encourage you.

81
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,340
Rym: Well, I guess every job is a tech job, increasingly.

82
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,852
Scott: That's basically what I said.

83
00:04:31,074 --> 00:04:31,679
Scott: I said that.

84
00:04:33,221 --> 00:04:36,420
Scott: But, yeah, they were like, you know, so I filled out the form, you know.

85
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,320
Scott: I'm just like, "Whatever," and filled out this form, right?

86
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:44,500
Scott: Plus, it'll let me do some—you know, mostly since we're working from home, I'm only seeing people from my team and not from any other team.

87
00:04:44,864 --> 00:04:46,239
Rym: I've been feeling that pretty hard.

88
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,720
Rym: Like, I lose track of what's going on in other teams lately.

89
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,659
Scott: So I said, "Oh, it'll be an opportunity to see other people from the other teams," right?

90
00:04:54,301 --> 00:04:56,760
Scott: So I signed up for it, and it snuck up.

91
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:02,108
Scott: When I signed up, the person in charge actually responded and was like, "Okay, we'll get you in.

92
00:05:02,188 --> 00:05:02,994
Scott: How about March

93
00:05:03,135 --> 00:05:03,175
Scott: 29th?".

94
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,991
Scott: And this was who knows when last year.

95
00:05:06,011 --> 00:05:07,278
Scott: I don't know when this was, right?

96
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:12,959
Scott: And then yesterday, Google Calendar is like, "Yeah, guess

97
00:05:12,999 --> 00:05:13,140
Scott: what?".

98
00:05:13,241 --> 00:05:15,156
Scott: And I'm like, "What?

99
00:05:15,176 --> 00:05:15,397
Scott: Is that

100
00:05:15,438 --> 00:05:15,700
Scott: happening?".

101
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,120
Rym: That is my one, during COVID, recurring nightmare of, "Wait, I'm out of PAX.

102
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,787
Rym: Wait, what panels are we doing?

103
00:05:21,807 --> 00:05:23,013
Rym: Where's Scott?

104
00:05:23,133 --> 00:05:24,560
Rym: Oh, shit, we gotta make some slides.

105
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,190
Rym: The panel starts in five minutes.

106
00:05:26,452 --> 00:05:27,640
Rym: Wait, what city are we in?

107
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,850
Rym: How are we gonna get to PAX?

108
00:05:29,112 --> 00:05:30,060
Rym: Wait, where's my mask?

109
00:05:30,423 --> 00:05:31,138
Rym: Where's everybody's

110
00:05:31,178 --> 00:05:31,260
Rym: mask?".

111
00:05:32,882 --> 00:05:35,120
Scott: So interestingly enough, it did happen today.

112
00:05:37,981 --> 00:05:42,780
Rym: Hey, if I know one thing about you, you were very good at being able to present anything.

113
00:05:42,882 --> 00:05:43,799
Rym: On very short notice.

114
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:47,020
Scott: I mean, I did the exact formula I just told you, right?

115
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,400
Scott: This is me, this is my career path, you know, ask me questions, right?

116
00:05:52,580 --> 00:06:02,080
Scott: And somehow, even though the only people who came, which I thought it was gonna be low turnout, you know, but it was basically the person who runs it and two interns.

117
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:02,944
Scott: I'm like,

118
00:06:03,105 --> 00:06:03,467
Scott: "Okay.".

119
00:06:03,487 --> 00:06:04,856
Scott: Or two other employees.

120
00:06:04,876 --> 00:06:08,560
Rym: I don't know if they were-- That is two more people than the smallest panel I ever gave at a con.

121
00:06:09,421 --> 00:06:10,367
Scott: Right, exactly.

122
00:06:10,427 --> 00:06:11,051
Scott: So I'm like,

123
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:11,755
Scott: "Alright.".

124
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,798
Scott: Well, the person running it was like, "Alright, let's just

125
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:16,040
Scott: start.".

126
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:16,382
Scott: And I'm like,

127
00:06:16,483 --> 00:06:16,846
Scott: "Okay.".

128
00:06:17,128 --> 00:06:19,869
Scott: I was gonna, you know, I was like, "Are you sure you guys wanna hear from

129
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:20,070
Scott: me?".

130
00:06:20,211 --> 00:06:21,360
Scott: They wanted to, okay.

131
00:06:21,921 --> 00:06:23,849
Scott: And it actually went real well.

132
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:26,340
Scott: Everyone seemed excited and asked like a million questions.

133
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,530
Scott: I'm like, "Okay, all two

134
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:27,913
Scott: people.".

135
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,604
Scott: So I'm like, "I don't

136
00:06:29,644 --> 00:06:29,865
Scott: care.".

137
00:06:29,885 --> 00:06:32,878
Scott: I was like, "This is better than a hundred people who just, you know, sit

138
00:06:32,898 --> 00:06:33,059
Scott: there.".

139
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:33,561
Scott: Right?

140
00:06:33,662 --> 00:06:36,180
Scott: It's, you know, two people who care.

141
00:06:36,281 --> 00:06:39,740
Scott: And I didn't even have to use any rules of question asking or anything.

142
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,360
Scott: I guess that works when there's only two people.

143
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:46,020
Rym: I guess if there's only two people, like what, one of them asks a terrible question and now they gotta deal with you talking to them.

144
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,040
Scott: No, but even the person running it was asking questions.

145
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,418
Scott: They asked questions, like I only talked for like 20 minutes.

146
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,220
Scott: And they asked questions for like 40 minutes, right?

147
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:55,554
Scott: So that was unexpected.

148
00:06:55,574 --> 00:06:56,339
Scott: But that was a thing.

149
00:06:56,602 --> 00:06:57,018
Scott: Sounds fun.

150
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,136
Scott: That was, you know, the last hour of my day there, so.

151
00:07:01,201 --> 00:07:02,090
Rym: Yeah, I got nothing.

152
00:07:02,111 --> 00:07:03,020
Rym: I haven't been doing anything.

153
00:07:03,807 --> 00:07:04,110
Scott: No.

154
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:05,280
Scott: News?

155
00:07:05,701 --> 00:07:07,680
Rym: So there is, of course, the biggest news.

156
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,020
Rym: That ship is not stuck anymore.

157
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:11,636
Rym: Like, for real.

158
00:07:13,443 --> 00:07:18,340
Scott: If it had remained stuck for longer, there would have been even greater, there were already consequences.

159
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,099
Scott: There would have been even greater consequences.

160
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,000
Scott: We have avoided even worse consequences.

161
00:07:23,385 --> 00:07:23,719
Scott: That's good.

162
00:07:24,641 --> 00:07:32,080
Rym: And the best thing I saw about this was a video of the people who worked, like, to actually unstick it.

163
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,600
Rym: Like, the team on the boat that was responsible for, like, fixing this biz.

164
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,840
Rym: They were, like, singing a song and celebrating as the ship got underway.

165
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:47,480
Rym: Like, imagine if, like, when I do some work, like, I don't know, a feature appears in the screen somewhere that some capital markets person uses.

166
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:52,596
Rym: But imagine if you can be like, "See that gigantic ship that's bigger than the original

167
00:07:52,636 --> 00:07:53,118
Rym: Enterprise?".

168
00:07:54,787 --> 00:07:57,100
Rym: I was part of the team that made it start moving again when it was not moving.

169
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:00,460
Scott: That's why they, like, smash champagne on boats when they finish them, right?

170
00:08:00,845 --> 00:08:01,372
Scott: They're like,

171
00:08:01,412 --> 00:08:01,879
Scott: "Hooray!".

172
00:08:02,101 --> 00:08:06,640
Rym: Christening boats is a whole history that I know a little bit about.

173
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,120
Scott: The point is, making a big-ass boat is a pain in the ass.

174
00:08:09,802 --> 00:08:12,978
Scott: So regardless of which ritual you want to do, right?

175
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,294
Scott: You know a ritual of some kind.

176
00:08:16,961 --> 00:08:22,337
Scott: Finishing a giant boat and having it actually go on a voyage for reals is a big celebration.

177
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:23,300
Scott: if you worked on that boat.

178
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:28,240
Rym: I mean, last night we were playing a Hearts of Iron multiplayer, and I was trying to make the navies work.

179
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,619
Rym: And, you know, it's a realistic game.

180
00:08:30,022 --> 00:08:32,857
Rym: So I'm like, "Yeah, alright, I'm Italy and I want to make one more

181
00:08:32,937 --> 00:08:33,159
Rym: boat.".

182
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,280
Rym: So in two years, that boat is going to come out and be able to do something.

183
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:38,299
Scott: Yup.

184
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,100
Rym: And I got, like, four factories pointed at that thing.

185
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:54,520
Scott: You know, what I was saying in the opening bit, to tie it in, there is, you know, an old-ass system from, who knows, from 90s-based, who knows, kind of garbage system that our entire company depends on, right?

186
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:58,700
Scott: And we're slowly replacing it with software that we're making on our own, right?

187
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,037
Scott: Like you do.

188
00:09:01,224 --> 00:09:02,779
Rym: Like most of my jobs have been.

189
00:09:03,802 --> 00:09:04,173
Scott: Oh, right.

190
00:09:05,801 --> 00:09:12,760
Scott: The day that we turn off that old system and can just delete that shit, that is going to be that kind of day, right?

191
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,076
Rym: We had a day like that.

192
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:20,240
Scott: That day is probably at least two or three years off, but if we stick at it, that day will come.

193
00:09:20,641 --> 00:09:20,721
Scott: I

194
00:09:20,741 --> 00:09:45,380
Rym: remember at IBM when we completed, because this dates me, I was part of the project, we've talked about this a lot, that migrated a big chunk of IBM's fabs from token rings to Ethernet, and when we completed it, there was a giant goddamn party, and everyone got plaques made out of the token ring cards that we had taken out of all these devices.

195
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,940
Scott: Oh yeah, I see you had the one, I saw it.

196
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:47,644
Rym: Yeah, you know where it is?

197
00:09:47,664 --> 00:09:48,973
Rym: It's on my desk at work right now.

198
00:09:49,114 --> 00:09:50,020
Rym: I haven't seen it in a while.

199
00:09:50,902 --> 00:10:03,139
Rym: Of course, I've had that sitting on my desk everywhere I've worked since IBM, because any time someone who's old enough sees it, they know exactly what it is instantly because of that D9 connector on the back.

200
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:11,140
Rym: So it's kind of a cool person detector, because anyone who recognizes what it is, we definitely have some stories we can tell each other.

201
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,739
Scott: Oh yeah, for sure.

202
00:10:14,121 --> 00:10:21,937
Rym: So, and some other equally big news, especially for us in New York, New York State, as of tomorrow, at 8 a.m.

203
00:10:22,037 --> 00:10:22,759
Rym: Eastern Time.

204
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,680
Scott: So for most of you right now, because you're going to be listening to this the day after, right?

205
00:10:29,623 --> 00:10:35,939
Rym: Yeah, but if you're listening to this right now, there are nine people listening to this right now, live, starting tomorrow at 8 a.m.

206
00:10:35,999 --> 00:10:36,480
Rym: Eastern Time.

207
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,996
Rym: New York State is opening up COVID vaccinations to any human being over the age of 30.

208
00:10:41,996 --> 00:10:43,159
Rym: No other qualifications.

209
00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:43,580
Rym: Go nuts.

210
00:10:43,681 --> 00:10:45,399
Rym: Just if you can get an appointment, do it.

211
00:10:46,181 --> 00:10:49,599
Scott: I'm going to try to get one and see when I can get one, but I'll keep trying.

212
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:54,576
Rym: I checked all the sites I know to see if they would let me make an appointment for after that date in advance.

213
00:10:54,617 --> 00:10:55,560
Rym: None of them do, of course.

214
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,240
Scott: No, you have to wait until then before you can make an appointment.

215
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,818
Rym: Yep, the question I have is of all the places I can go, some of them I think are going to update at 8 a.m.

216
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:07,740
Scott: Just like a seniors can't, you know, juniors can't register for classes until after the seniors do something.

217
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,564
Rym: You know what's really funny?

218
00:11:08,624 --> 00:11:11,779
Rym: You talked about that when you were like, just wait, like, you know, do what we used to do at RIT.

219
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:20,120
Rym: You remember that I never had to deal with that shit because I was technically two grades ahead of all of you, so I got to register before everyone in my actual grade.

220
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,180
Scott: You were still registering with people who were...

221
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:26,580
Rym: No, when I was a freshman, after my first quarter, I registered with the juniors because I had so many credits.

222
00:11:27,343 --> 00:11:30,080
Scott: Right, but those people were still fighting for classes.

223
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:35,479
Rym: But they weren't fighting for the classes I had to take because I was still signing up for freshman classes, but that's how I got into all the cool stuff.

224
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:41,220
Scott: Right, the classes may not have filled up, but the system was still under the pressure of all those people.

225
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:41,562
Rym: That is true.

226
00:11:42,004 --> 00:11:43,010
Rym: I just had an advantage.

227
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,819
Rym: It was less dire for me to get in.

228
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:50,720
Rym: I only needed four terminals constantly trying to connect to that telnet service that let us register for classes.

229
00:11:51,543 --> 00:11:55,479
Scott: Meanwhile, for all that hassle, I never was unable to get the classes I needed.

230
00:11:56,501 --> 00:11:57,826
Rym: The stakes were pretty low for us.

231
00:11:57,846 --> 00:11:58,830
Rym: You know what my stakes were?

232
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:01,018
Rym: I didn't want to have classes on Friday.

233
00:12:01,499 --> 00:12:01,640
Rym: Ever.

234
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,023
Rym: That was a hard rule.

235
00:12:03,745 --> 00:12:08,480
Rym: Some classes, there was a bunch of Friday options, but there's only one Good Tuesday option.

236
00:12:09,281 --> 00:12:10,405
Rym: So, relatively low stakes.

237
00:12:11,027 --> 00:12:15,100
Rym: Or, I always wanted to get into cool classes like massage therapy, which were really hard to get into.

238
00:12:16,082 --> 00:12:16,959
Scott: I didn't want to get into that.

239
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,107
Rym: That class was great.

240
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,760
Rym: I took it three times.

241
00:12:20,881 --> 00:12:21,558
Scott: That's a lot of times.

242
00:12:21,801 --> 00:12:25,580
Rym: But I could never get into that whiskey class or that wine class as much as I tried.

243
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,780
Scott: I didn't want those classes or anything.

244
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,542
Rym: Yep, I did.

245
00:12:29,044 --> 00:12:32,760
Rym: But yeah, if you live in New York State, go try to get a vaccine.

246
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:36,260
Rym: By the time you listen to this, you can probably just go sign up for one.

247
00:12:37,683 --> 00:12:42,961
Rym: And, the following week, they're opening up to anyone over the age of 16.

248
00:12:42,961 --> 00:12:45,860
Scott: So I just want to remind, while we're on the vaccine topic, right?

249
00:12:46,203 --> 00:12:47,093
Rym: I know what you're going to say.

250
00:12:47,114 --> 00:12:47,640
Rym: It's a good point.

251
00:12:48,262 --> 00:12:53,000
Rym: Just because you get the vaccine, don't just go apeshit and go back to your old business.

252
00:12:53,781 --> 00:12:57,720
Rym: There's a lot of things you can do more safely, but don't go around licking things.

253
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,153
Rym: Don't immediately go into dense restaurants.

254
00:13:00,173 --> 00:13:01,259
Rym: Don't try to go to a convention.

255
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:02,421
Scott: Right.

256
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:07,680
Scott: If you look at the graph, it's going up right now at a scary rate, suddenly.

257
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:14,459
Rym: I think the rate is going up almost exactly a couple weeks after fucking New York State opened up indoor dining again.

258
00:13:15,404 --> 00:13:18,440
Scott: It could be, but regardless, it's going up in a lot of places.

259
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:25,816
Scott: So, we don't know if it's a variant situation, if it's an irresponsible... People are suddenly getting irresponsible because it's warm.

260
00:13:25,876 --> 00:13:26,340
Scott: We don't know.

261
00:13:26,821 --> 00:13:31,260
Scott: So, the point is, just because you're vaccinated, do not act irresponsibly.

262
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:41,760
Scott: It is not some license to return to 2019 life immediately, just because you... Even if you had the vaccine a couple weeks ago, and it's fully... You had all doses and everything.

263
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,245
Scott: You can't be going out with no mask.

264
00:13:44,386 --> 00:13:51,040
Scott: Even if it does protect you, they say it lowers transmission rates to other people.

265
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,880
Scott: It doesn't eliminate, right?

266
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,907
Scott: They talk about percent effectiveness.

267
00:13:55,088 --> 00:13:56,836
Scott: Even the best ones are not 100%, right?

268
00:13:57,941 --> 00:14:02,760
Scott: It's not time yet to just forget all about this nonsense.

269
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,008
Scott: That time will still come.

270
00:14:04,028 --> 00:14:05,660
Scott: That time will come sooner.

271
00:14:06,422 --> 00:14:16,280
Rym: Once I get it, are things like, instead of my "never enter another building ever under any circumstances" policy, I might, if I need to, mask up and go into a bike shop.

272
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,940
Scott: I have been entering the grocery store pretty much the whole time.

273
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:23,120
Rym: We have not had to go to a grocery store at any point during this whole thing.

274
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,007
Rym: Fresh Direct only.

275
00:14:24,027 --> 00:14:25,180
Rym: And other services.

276
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:28,180
Scott: I may be a Fresh Direct, but I would go into other stores, you know.

277
00:14:28,962 --> 00:14:34,080
Rym: I went into a mostly empty CVS once to get some Gatorade, because I was desperate.

278
00:14:35,523 --> 00:14:38,519
Rym: Went into the vet once to take the rabbit there to get some stuff done.

279
00:14:40,341 --> 00:14:47,800
Rym: I went into a large empty room where they let one person in at a time to order food at a takeaway restaurant once.

280
00:14:50,449 --> 00:14:51,038
Rym: That might be it.

281
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,500
Scott: Yeah, we went into, you know, very rarely, right?

282
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,340
Scott: But it's like, you know, we go to the grocery store once in a, maybe, I don't know how many times, right?

283
00:14:59,601 --> 00:15:01,399
Scott: And then, I never did indoor dining.

284
00:15:02,162 --> 00:15:02,719
Scott: No, no, no.

285
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,598
Scott: We went to the Japanese grocery a few times now and then.

286
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:12,080
Scott: You know, there have been places where I think I got food to pick up, and I would go in, get the food, and walk out.

287
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:12,801
Scott: Right?

288
00:15:12,982 --> 00:15:15,320
Scott: I've done that a few times, you know.

289
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,980
Rym: Yep, but all the changes to my life are going to be slow.

290
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:24,800
Scott: The point is, do not start immediately just going out, having a good time, whatever, right?

291
00:15:25,661 --> 00:15:29,614
Scott: When you see that graph go down, way down, like in the way low area, right?

292
00:15:31,844 --> 00:15:33,940
Scott: Then, yeah, I'm just going to return to normal life.

293
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:38,420
Rym: Like, I wouldn't go to a Rangers game even if, like, next week.

294
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,019
Rym: But I might go to one, like, later in the year.

295
00:15:41,904 --> 00:15:43,640
Scott: Next season, whenever that starts.

296
00:15:44,862 --> 00:15:44,996
Scott: Right.

297
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:49,980
Rym: So, in some other news, this is news that is a callback.

298
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:54,040
Rym: We've talked about this before, but it's come back badder than before.

299
00:15:54,481 --> 00:15:54,910
Rym: It's Mr.

300
00:15:54,951 --> 00:15:55,400
Rym: Toe Jam.

301
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:56,787
Scott: Mr.

302
00:15:56,807 --> 00:15:57,114
Scott: Toe Jam.

303
00:15:58,002 --> 00:16:02,300
Scott: So, if you don't know, the infamous RMS, Richard Stallman, right?

304
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:07,280
Scott: The so-called starter of the open source as a movement, right?

305
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:16,520
Scott: Because there was open source free software before Stallman, but Stallman, his thing is that he made it, like, a political kind of thing, right?

306
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,237
Scott: He's like, "No, software has to be open

307
00:16:20,277 --> 00:16:20,579
Scott: source.".

308
00:16:21,001 --> 00:16:27,720
Rym: And that is noteworthy, it's important, it was a noble cause, but that does not excuse the fact that, as a person, he's been a piece of shit.

309
00:16:28,462 --> 00:16:31,580
Scott: He's a disgusting person, in more ways than one.

310
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:31,938
Scott: Yup.

311
00:16:33,223 --> 00:16:35,500
Rym: We don't need to dwell on all the ways he's disgusting.

312
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,377
Scott: We do not.

313
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:37,479
Scott: Go Google it.

314
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,277
Rym: You'll see a terrifying video.

315
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:43,779
Scott: Around a year and a half ago, you know, he was booted, right?

316
00:16:44,161 --> 00:16:49,640
Scott: Because he was too bad for anyone to carry on with.

317
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:51,955
Scott: So, he just got the boot.

318
00:16:52,823 --> 00:16:53,830
Scott: And I thought that that was it.

319
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,246
Scott: I was like, "Oh, you got the boot.

320
00:16:56,407 --> 00:16:57,031
Scott: We're good.

321
00:16:57,152 --> 00:16:57,494
Scott: We're good

322
00:16:57,514 --> 00:16:57,755
Scott: now.".

323
00:16:58,661 --> 00:17:00,859
Scott: We don't have to deal with that guy anymore, right?

324
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:08,118
Scott: And I'm not asking this question facetiously, I'm honestly asking this question, because I haven't been able to find out the answer.

325
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:08,474
Scott: Yup.

326
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:14,960
Scott: How much of the free software did RMS actually write?

327
00:17:16,127 --> 00:17:16,559
Scott: Like, code.

328
00:17:16,781 --> 00:17:18,440
Scott: It could have been that it's possible.

329
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,740
Scott: He could have actually wrote, like, most of it, right?

330
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,339
Scott: And was responsible, but I don't know.

331
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,118
Scott: Maybe he wasn't.

332
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:29,740
Scott: Maybe he was just, you know, the sort of, you know, flag bearer, right?

333
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:29,840
Scott: Yup.

334
00:17:29,941 --> 00:17:31,580
Scott: And didn't actually code that much.

335
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,110
Scott: I'm not sure.

336
00:17:33,702 --> 00:17:42,280
Scott: But regardless, I want to know, because that's relevant to his value, evaluating his value to the movement, right?

337
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:52,599
Scott: Anyway, the point is, is that the Free Software Foundation sort of showed their whole ass by bringing him back on.

338
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,533
Scott: They're like, "Okay, he had a timeout.

339
00:17:54,553 --> 00:17:55,259
Scott: We're bringing him back

340
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:55,319
Scott: on.".

341
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:56,539
Rym: No, that doesn't work.

342
00:17:57,722 --> 00:18:02,100
Rym: You might have been able to get away with that in, like, the '80s and '90s, but, like, there's an internet and social media.

343
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,560
Rym: We're all going to find out pretty much instantly.

344
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,002
Scott: Right.

345
00:18:05,063 --> 00:18:06,140
Scott: Everyone found that instantly.

346
00:18:06,481 --> 00:18:14,600
Scott: And basically, the reaction, it was very good in that we can now see who's good and who's not good, right?

347
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:14,960
Rym: Yup.

348
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:21,780
Rym: It was denounced by the EFF, by the Tor project, by Mozilla, by the Crater of Rust, by the Ottomans.

349
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:32,780
Scott: The biggest one is that the Free Software Foundation, which is just, like, this nonprofit thing, Red Hat, which is owned by IBM, is basically like, "All right, you're going to have him on?

350
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,344
Scott: Guess what?

351
00:18:33,727 --> 00:18:35,120
Scott: No more money for you," right?

352
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,171
Scott: It's like, that's a severe blow.

353
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,299
Rym: What were they thinking?

354
00:18:43,183 --> 00:18:50,940
Scott: I only saw one link, so I'm not sure if this is true, but I think the chairman of the FSF board resigned.

355
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:51,606
Scott: I'm not sure.

356
00:18:51,626 --> 00:18:52,480
Scott: You have to check on that.

357
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:59,380
Scott: But regardless, the pressure is on for now, not only for Stahlmann to get the boot a second time.

358
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,380
Rym: But whoever tried to make this happen and bring him back.

359
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:08,920
Scott: But what the good people want is for the whole Free Software Foundation board to just get out.

360
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,489
Scott: It's like, all of you get out.

361
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:11,556
Scott: We'll get all new people.

362
00:19:11,576 --> 00:19:12,180
Scott: We don't need you.

363
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:23,580
Rym: And it's worth pointing out, like, this is a change that I very much welcome in the tech industry, which has, as we've talked about many times and I'm sure you've encountered, a troubled history with social issues.

364
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:24,956
Scott: You don't say.

365
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,398
Rym: To put it very...

366
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,717
Scott: The sexisms and the racisms.

367
00:19:28,524 --> 00:19:30,720
Rym: Sometimes it's sexism and racism combined.

368
00:19:31,661 --> 00:19:33,440
Rym: Also libertarian, just anyway.

369
00:19:34,361 --> 00:19:42,480
Scott: Well, there's a huge crossover between people who... It's strange, the crossover between people who believe in free software and also believe in libertarian nonsense.

370
00:19:43,493 --> 00:19:43,700
Scott: Freedom.

371
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,780
Rym: But also, I think that's a self-fulfilling prophecy.

372
00:19:46,960 --> 00:20:01,520
Rym: I think a lot of the people who were driving the open source movement and were also white dudes who overlapped themselves with libertarians set a tone that then made it appear that the free software movement was mostly white libertarian dudes.

373
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,120
Rym: Like, I think we're gonna...

374
00:20:04,581 --> 00:20:10,420
Scott: And if you look at the comments and discussions on these newses, on whatever site you go to, you'll see those people.

375
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:10,909
Scott: They're there.

376
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:11,320
Scott: They're still there.

377
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:23,340
Rym: But what I appreciate is that the social media and, like, marketing people who are having to respond to this are not, like, equivocating or giving very, like, PR language.

378
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,671
Rym: Red Hat's statement was perfect.

379
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,340
Rym: I'm gonna quote it because it's short.

380
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,860
Rym: Red Hat was appalled to learn that Stallman is rejoining the FSF board directors.

381
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:39,380
Rym: As a result, we are immediately suspending all Red Hat funding of the FSF and any FSF hosted events, period.

382
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,760
Rym: That is the entire statement.

383
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:41,852
Scott: The end.

384
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,140
Rym: That is how you denounce someone who deserves denouncing.

385
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,025
Rym: Don't equivocate.

386
00:20:46,367 --> 00:20:48,420
Rym: Just do it and say why.

387
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:49,565
Scott: Yeah.

388
00:20:50,524 --> 00:20:53,740
Scott: You know what would be really cool is if you add a little bit of role-playing to civilization.

389
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,960
Scott: So when you denounce, you have to write your denouncement.

390
00:20:56,662 --> 00:21:00,220
Rym: I say, henceforth, in our online games, that's our rule.

391
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,700
Rym: If you denounce someone, you gotta write a statement.

392
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:16,300
Scott: What if we just take civilization, right, and we take every action you can do in a game of Civ, and then we remove all the numbers and mechanical winning/losing parts, and we just replace everything with a role-playing part instead.

393
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:24,000
Scott: So when you build a unit, right, you don't care how strong the unit is or anything like that.

394
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,760
Rym: But you're adding some narrative around that unit.

395
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,300
Scott: All you do is you say, "Ah, I knight thee, sir," because you built a knight.

396
00:21:32,521 --> 00:21:33,936
Scott: You're saying, "Ah, I knight thee, sir,".

397
00:21:33,997 --> 00:21:34,300
Scott: whatever.

398
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,780
Scott: You have to role-play building the knight.

399
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:42,300
Rym: And now you've brought that knight with that name into the universe of the game that just grows and grows and grows.

400
00:21:42,521 --> 00:21:42,918
Rym: Exactly.

401
00:21:43,684 --> 00:21:46,900
Scott: Ah, we have finished the such-and-such, right?

402
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,658
Scott: The great granaries, little brother.

403
00:21:53,222 --> 00:21:55,080
Rym: This is just getting deep in inside jokes.

404
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,999
Rym: I'm going to talk about the boat Mormons next.

405
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:57,990
Scott: Sure.

406
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:03,900
Scott: But I just replace all actions with role-playing actions and remove all the mechanical winning/losing actions.

407
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:04,965
Rym: Don't let us forget that.

408
00:22:05,005 --> 00:22:06,412
Rym: we just said this, because we're going to forget.

409
00:22:06,452 --> 00:22:08,180
Rym: we had this conversation, and this is an idea.

410
00:22:08,421 --> 00:22:09,379
Scott: This is never going to happen.

411
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,143
Rym: No, no.

412
00:22:10,404 --> 00:22:13,518
Rym: I want to think about it long enough to want to do it and then not do it.

413
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,410
Rym: I don't want to forget it now.

414
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:16,019
Rym: I want to forget it.

415
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:16,789
Scott: Mission accomplished.

416
00:22:16,809 --> 00:22:17,338
Scott: Let's move on.

417
00:22:20,322 --> 00:22:26,740
Rym: So in some other news, Amazon, as you know, is trying to prevent its workers from unionizing.

418
00:22:27,101 --> 00:22:27,956
Rym: We talked about that.

419
00:22:30,222 --> 00:22:30,694
Rym: What?

420
00:22:30,735 --> 00:22:30,858
Rym: Really?

421
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:46,060
Rym: Also, Amazon's official news Twitter account has been getting weirdly aggressive about this lately in a way that is only making things worse for them, and it's kind of amazing to watch in real time.

422
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,303
Rym: But the icing on the cake is.

423
00:22:48,364 --> 00:22:50,469
Rym: a while ago, I saw a bunch of stories.

424
00:22:50,509 --> 00:22:51,852
Rym: I can't find all the old stories.

425
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:55,120
Rym: I'll just link to this one thing, but we'll talk about this more in the forum.

426
00:22:56,681 --> 00:23:04,900
Rym: There was a bunch of studies of a bunch of Twitter botnets people found that were all following each other and didn't really have normal people following them.

427
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:13,500
Rym: There were these semi-closed networks of accounts that appeared to be auto-generated and all had AI-generated faces and profiles.

428
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,220
Scott: See, I'm not -- I mean, they could be AI-generated faces.

429
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,600
Rym: Why would this -- the photoshopping would take way too much effort.

430
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,156
Rym: I found some libraries that'll make faces like this for you.

431
00:23:22,237 --> 00:23:22,760
Rym: Millions of them.

432
00:23:23,061 --> 00:23:23,502
Scott: It could be.

433
00:23:23,643 --> 00:23:24,024
Scott: It could be.

434
00:23:24,104 --> 00:23:25,348
Scott: It's believable both ways.

435
00:23:25,408 --> 00:23:28,036
Scott: The point is, they're clearly fake bot accounts.

436
00:23:28,076 --> 00:23:29,320
Scott: They're not real human beings.

437
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:40,860
Rym: Well, there was a story a while ago about Amazon encouraging their workers to make "real" accounts and encouraging them and incentivizing them to say anti-union things in public.

438
00:23:41,882 --> 00:23:49,720
Scott: That could be true, and it could be -- not only could that be true, it could simultaneously also be cover for the botnet.

439
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:58,560
Scott: You could have real employees do that and pretend that the botnet was employees that you paid, right?

440
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:00,973
Scott: Or it could just be the cover story.

441
00:24:01,033 --> 00:24:02,120
Scott: It doesn't matter either way.

442
00:24:02,981 --> 00:24:09,740
Scott: Or, if you want to go real conspiracy theory, someone else who's not Amazon could be doing this to make Amazon look bad.

443
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,380
Scott: What if that's an Apple-made botnet?

444
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,780
Rym: Or someone else could be doing it so Amazon has plausible deniability.

445
00:24:16,941 --> 00:24:17,283
Scott: Right.

446
00:24:17,303 --> 00:24:19,960
Scott: The point is that none of those things matter, right?

447
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:26,540
Rym: All that matters is that this is a fucking bot, and that face was either photoshopped or AI-generated, and it's pertaining to be --.

448
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:33,980
Scott: What matters is that the botnet is real, and regardless of who's running it, for what reasons or how, Twitter has not deleted it.

449
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:41,519
Scott: Twitter can just shut this down instantly, and they haven't, so the news is not necessarily "Amazon is

450
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:41,780
Scott: evil.".

451
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,403
Scott: That's not news.

452
00:24:42,443 --> 00:24:43,388
Scott: We knew that already.

453
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:45,558
Scott: The news is that Twitter is weak.

454
00:24:47,300 --> 00:25:01,980
Rym: The other interesting news, and there'll be more on this later, is that one very easy way to detect these algorithmically-generated faces -- and I dug around more -- is that they'll make certain kinds of errors that aren't obvious unless you look closely.

455
00:25:02,702 --> 00:25:09,420
Rym: And the most common error is they will make someone's glasses look different.

456
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:13,519
Rym: Like, the frame on one side of someone's face will be different from the frame on the other side of someone's face.

457
00:25:14,181 --> 00:25:18,380
Rym: Or an earring will not actually be attached in any reasonable way.

458
00:25:19,922 --> 00:25:24,220
Rym: Those are the two biggest indicators that this is an AI-generated fake face.

459
00:25:26,701 --> 00:25:33,080
Rym: The third one, less common, I think, I don't know, but the one I saw some researchers talking about is wrong number of teeth.

460
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:40,040
Scott: I don't know the right number of teeth unless I count my own mouth and then add four.

461
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:44,255
Rym: Yep, but there'll be an extra incisor on some of these.

462
00:25:44,436 --> 00:25:45,440
Rym: You'll see stuff like that happening.

463
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,680
Scott: Do all people have the same number of teeth, assuming none are pulled out?

464
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,920
Rym: Yes, assuming none are pulled out, or there's a problem.

465
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,470
Scott: Okay, I just wasn't sure.

466
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:54,840
Scott: Maybe some people out there have more teeth.

467
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,620
Rym: Well, like, my mom's second husband had an extra tooth, but it was in the middle of the top of his mouth.

468
00:26:03,722 --> 00:26:04,304
Rym: It just grew there.

469
00:26:04,385 --> 00:26:06,836
Rym: A doctor found it, and he was like, "What the fuck is that?

470
00:26:06,876 --> 00:26:07,559
Rym: You've got an extra wisdom

471
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:07,680
Rym: tooth!".

472
00:26:08,102 --> 00:26:11,720
Scott: You sure that isn't some, like, narwhal-type action?

473
00:26:12,423 --> 00:26:14,339
Rym: I mean, that might be how you get narwhals.

474
00:26:15,346 --> 00:26:15,620
Scott: Okay.

475
00:26:17,561 --> 00:26:20,220
Rym: So, uh, last... Oh, no, that was my last nose.

476
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,650
Rym: But anyway, things of the day!

477
00:26:27,991 --> 00:26:33,370
Rym: So I found what was originally a tweet that had this amazing image, and I wanted to make that my thing of the day.

478
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:38,020
Rym: But then I wondered, "Wait, this image is from some Japanese book or some Japanese researchers?

479
00:26:38,641 --> 00:26:39,202
Rym: What's the source?

480
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:40,225
Rym: I want to link to, like, the book or

481
00:26:40,245 --> 00:26:40,606
Rym: something.".

482
00:26:42,811 --> 00:26:47,290
Rym: And when I poked around, it actually got a little bit fascinating, and then I found this page.

483
00:26:47,831 --> 00:26:52,610
Rym: And the page kind of documents, like, the provenance of this image.

484
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:54,537
Rym: And it was fascinating.

485
00:26:54,597 --> 00:26:57,210
Rym: The image itself is my thing of the day, because that's amazing.

486
00:26:57,631 --> 00:27:06,250
Rym: It is this illustrated cross-section that was based on research of what Kowloon, the Walled City, was actually like.

487
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:10,990
Rym: Because it doesn't exist anymore, and its interior was not well-documented.

488
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:15,584
Rym: For reasons that, if you don't know what Kowloon is, go read the Wikipedia page about it.

489
00:27:15,644 --> 00:27:17,550
Rym: It's fucking nuts what this was.

490
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:26,130
Scott: Yeah, there is no time to explain it here, but it is a very significant place in terms of, you know, like, the cyberpunk...

491
00:27:26,893 --> 00:27:29,484
Rym: You want to know where a lot of cyberpunk aesthetic comes from?

492
00:27:29,825 --> 00:27:30,930
Rym: Like, you want to know...

493
00:27:31,171 --> 00:27:33,930
Scott: And this was a real place that really existed.

494
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:38,929
Rym: Yes, the shortest answer is, Hong Kong was occupied by Japan in World War II.

495
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:49,270
Rym: There were a lot of debates around whether or not China owned, like, where was the border between China and Hong Kong during the era when Hong Kong was still a part of Britain.

496
00:27:49,691 --> 00:27:55,650
Rym: Complicated treaties basically meant that this one area, nobody owned it.

497
00:27:56,370 --> 00:28:00,429
Rym: And the agreement was, China officially owned it, but agreed not to fuck with it.

498
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:06,850
Rym: Britain agreed that China owned it, but was actually responsible for it.

499
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:11,248
Rym: But to avoid angering China, Britain said, "Look, we'll just leave it alone,

500
00:28:11,328 --> 00:28:11,469
Rym: too.".

501
00:28:12,051 --> 00:28:19,230
Rym: It was a lawless skyscraper, arcology city, filled with amazing nonsense, we will never know the full story of Kowloon.

502
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:20,989
Scott: I'm sure also lots of horror.

503
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:26,150
Rym: Oh, uh, the triads, like, used it as bases, international crime, human trafficking.

504
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:32,330
Rym: There were very amazing things that happened in Kowloon, and also terrifying things that China and Britain should have stopped.

505
00:28:35,452 --> 00:28:40,350
Rym: But, this is a cross-section of kind of, like, what was going on in Kowloon.

506
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:42,750
Rym: Like, what did this structure look like?

507
00:28:43,391 --> 00:28:48,710
Rym: Imagine a bunch of skyscrapers organically connected together, and between 10 and 50 thousand people living in it.

508
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:55,369
Scott: Yeah, and it's like, you see pictures of the inside of it, and it's just like, you can see that, like, okay, there's one area.

509
00:28:55,810 --> 00:29:01,450
Scott: And then it's like, but how the areas connect doesn't really make sense, it's sort of like going into the Times Square AMC, but only worse.

510
00:29:03,552 --> 00:29:07,930
Scott: And then, to look at it from the outside, it looks like just a bunch of buildings, right?

511
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:16,490
Scott: So, you know, it's like, how does, what's, you know, it's like, normally you can understand the layout of a building, it's usually laid out, you know, symmetrically in some way, right?

512
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:23,310
Scott: But the layout of this thing made no sense, so the cross-section at least helps make sense out of it, right?

513
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,598
Scott: Where are things?

514
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:25,162
Rym: How do people get around?

515
00:29:26,851 --> 00:29:36,970
Rym: But it also talks about the person who has, was like, wait, I found this image hosted in a million million different places, but it was also, like, scanned shittily, so I wanted to go find the original image.

516
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:52,310
Rym: And then they, like, found a bunch of interesting things about this image, and who was hosting it, and, like, a part of it was, like, replaced in the most common image that people were passing around, and there's just, like, this whole meta-story about where this image came from.

517
00:29:53,411 --> 00:30:06,030
Scott: I just feel like the biggest, I guess, allure of it, right, is that in the real world, for the most part, maze-like places don't really exist, short of, like, a corn maze.

518
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:09,730
Rym: And for reasons you can imagine, if there's a fire in a maze, like, guess what happens?

519
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:19,470
Scott: Right, yeah, mazes are super dangerous, and have all, they just offer lots and lots of opportunities for danger and bad things to happen, right?

520
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:23,963
Scott: People can go to somewhere, and it's, like, no one can find them, right?

521
00:30:24,043 --> 00:30:26,250
Scott: It's not good for that kind of thing to exist.

522
00:30:26,871 --> 00:30:33,230
Scott: So, most buildings are laid out in ways, and most land is laid out in ways that, like, yeah, it's, you know, makes sense.

523
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:39,103
Rym: But it's also a case study in humans left to their own devices having to use this space.

524
00:30:39,864 --> 00:30:40,606
Rym: What happens?

525
00:30:40,726 --> 00:30:42,370
Rym: What do they do to that space?

526
00:30:43,151 --> 00:30:52,328
Scott: Right, but in the same way, while the maze creates so much danger, the idea of it also creates a sense of, like, you know, magic and mystery, right?

527
00:30:52,348 --> 00:30:53,410
Scott: Like, labyrinth, right?

528
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,490
Rym: It's part of our history.

529
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:56,052
Scott: Right, exactly.

530
00:30:56,132 --> 00:31:03,124
Scott: So, I think that's why this place continues to have some sort of mystique to it.

531
00:31:03,565 --> 00:31:05,990
Scott: that is, you know, perhaps racist in many ways.

532
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:09,258
Rym: Yeah, but there is a legit, real mystique.

533
00:31:09,298 --> 00:31:11,384
Rym: Like, I've spent a lot of time in Hong Kong.

534
00:31:12,005 --> 00:31:13,710
Rym: I've been to where, 'cause it's gone now.

535
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:15,816
Rym: You know when it was destroyed?

536
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,968
Rym: Way more recently than you might think.

537
00:31:18,008 --> 00:31:18,169
Scott: The '90s.

538
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:18,754
Scott: Not too long ago.

539
00:31:18,774 --> 00:31:19,361
Scott: Yeah, very recently.

540
00:31:19,401 --> 00:31:20,190
Scott: Yeah, very recently.

541
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:26,230
Rym: But there are parts of it that are still there, and there's also some museums and some monuments to it, and, like, one of the gates is there.

542
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:33,090
Rym: But nowadays, it's a park, and its governance is still complicated, as Hong Kong is complicated, and that's a whole other thing.

543
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:34,850
Scott: No, Hong Kong's even more complicated now anyway.

544
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:43,169
Rym: Yeah, but you can go to where it is, and it's one of those things that I wish I had been able to go to Hong Kong before this was destroyed, just to see it.

545
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:45,350
Scott: No, you wouldn't want to go in it, I don't think.

546
00:31:45,833 --> 00:31:48,726
Rym: Well, I mean, I would've wanted to, but... You wanted to?

547
00:31:49,473 --> 00:31:50,849
Rym: I also would've been in middle school.

548
00:31:52,978 --> 00:31:53,829
Scott: It would've been rather dangerous.

549
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:54,772
Rym: And it would've been a terrible idea.

550
00:31:54,792 --> 00:32:01,550
Rym: I mean, I have, I'll admit, I have gone to and explored places I shouldn't have in my international travels many times.

551
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,210
Scott: But were those places occupied?

552
00:32:03,971 --> 00:32:05,214
Rym: Yes!

553
00:32:05,795 --> 00:32:13,670
Rym: I actually got, was inside, I spent some time wandering around inside of the Indian equivalent of a favela when I was in Mumbai for half a day.

554
00:32:15,376 --> 00:32:18,010
Scott: But that's not quite in a walled, maze-like city, right?

555
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:32,450
Rym: It was similar in that the buildings in it were not regulated and were just built on top of each other in a ridiculous, cacophony nightmare, and police would not go in there, and it was similar, but not quite to the scale of Kowloon.

556
00:32:33,291 --> 00:32:33,452
Scott: Yeah.

557
00:32:33,472 --> 00:32:34,978
Rym: I would still take that over Kowloon.

558
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:43,450
Rym: I'm just saying I'm very unafraid of that kind of exploration, but it is risky depending on what you do.

559
00:32:44,113 --> 00:32:47,170
Scott: I think that I would also go to the place you described.

560
00:32:48,052 --> 00:32:48,798
Rym: I think you would've.

561
00:32:49,726 --> 00:32:50,210
Rym: I did too.

562
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:56,030
Scott: But I would not go, mostly I would be going in search of food, but I'm sure those people are cooking something good.

563
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:57,171
Rym: Ah, yes.

564
00:32:57,532 --> 00:32:58,754
Rym: Good fucking god.

565
00:32:58,834 --> 00:33:00,716
Rym: Actually, Manila was like that too.

566
00:33:00,836 --> 00:33:10,550
Rym: One day when I was there, and then we'll get to your main thing of the day, instead of taking a car a few miles to get to a place, I just walked along the highway just to see what the neighborhoods were like.

567
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:18,910
Rym: The food I smelled and saw, just in the neighborhoods walking to my destination, those were some of the best smells I've ever experienced.

568
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:23,145
Scott: Yeah, I don't feel like Kowloon was a culinary, you know.

569
00:33:23,165 --> 00:33:24,350
Rym: It might've been.

570
00:33:25,131 --> 00:33:33,889
Rym: It seems like there was a food scene in there that was mythological in Hong Kong among people who lived in Hong Kong at the time.

571
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:35,158
Scott: Oh, okay.

572
00:33:35,199 --> 00:33:35,810
Scott: Maybe I'm okay.

573
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:36,652
Rym: This is secondhand.

574
00:33:36,712 --> 00:33:38,195
Rym: I don't know a lot about Kowloon.

575
00:33:38,215 --> 00:33:44,390
Rym: Most of what I know is people in Hong Kong telling me about it over the years and just reading about it while I was there.

576
00:33:45,211 --> 00:33:45,712
Scott: Alright, so.

577
00:33:46,414 --> 00:33:47,157
Scott: My thing of the day.

578
00:33:47,197 --> 00:33:48,420
Scott: Some listener posted this.

579
00:33:48,521 --> 00:33:49,524
Scott: I'm sorry, listener.

580
00:33:49,544 --> 00:33:50,868
Scott: I forget which listener it was.

581
00:33:50,988 --> 00:33:51,670
Scott: It was the listener.

582
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:53,512
Scott: You can take credit for it.

583
00:33:54,373 --> 00:34:04,890
Scott: And people, if you want to find out which listener it was and give them the credit they deserve for finding this on the internet, come to our Discord and our forums and all the stuff we'll talk about in a moment and find them.

584
00:34:05,371 --> 00:34:09,418
Scott: I'm sure they will point themselves out or you can just find their post of this.

585
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:16,190
Scott: Regardless, this is a YouTube video and I'm going to spoil the whole YouTube video.

586
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:17,292
Scott: But it doesn't matter.

587
00:34:17,312 --> 00:34:23,889
Scott: You should watch the YouTube video anyway because even though I'm going to spoil the secret of the information in the video, the presentation is excellent.

588
00:34:24,449 --> 00:34:24,591
Rym: It is.

589
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:29,010
Rym: It's very similar to that video I did around the how a pulley works and how to use a snatch block.

590
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:34,900
Scott: So the point is, let's say you get a tree, an avocado tree, and it's producing delicious avocados, right?

591
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,141
Scott: Well, you open up an avocado.

592
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:38,125
Scott: There's a big ass freaking seed in there, right?

593
00:34:38,166 --> 00:34:39,167
Scott: Right in the middle of the avocado.

594
00:34:39,187 --> 00:34:40,550
Scott: You always got to pick it out and throw it out.

595
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:45,358
Scott: Well, what if you planted that avocado seed from the middle of the avocado and grew it?

596
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:47,621
Scott: Wouldn't it create an avocado tree?

597
00:34:47,962 --> 00:34:50,226
Scott: Wouldn't that tree produce delicious avocados?

598
00:34:50,286 --> 00:34:52,190
Scott: Just like assuming you took care of it properly.

599
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:55,333
Rym: I mean, it will grow an avocado tree, right?

600
00:34:55,774 --> 00:34:58,558
Scott: Wouldn't it produce those same delicious avocados that you just ate?

601
00:34:58,618 --> 00:35:00,300
Scott: And the answer is no, it won't.

602
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,825
Scott: It will produce most likely in all likelihood, like 99% chance.

603
00:35:04,885 --> 00:35:08,670
Scott: it will produce disgusting avocados that you have no desire to eat whatsoever.

604
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:09,912
Scott: Yep.

605
00:35:10,132 --> 00:35:11,233
Rym: Apples trees are the same way.

606
00:35:11,273 --> 00:35:13,116
Rym: I had no idea avocados were like this, too.

607
00:35:13,436 --> 00:35:13,957
Scott: Yeah, you take it.

608
00:35:14,037 --> 00:35:18,383
Scott: I take a Macintosh apple, you take the seeds out, you plant them, you get them to grow like Johnny Appleseed.

609
00:35:18,643 --> 00:35:20,165
Scott: The tree comes, apples come.

610
00:35:20,205 --> 00:35:20,766
Scott: And guess what?

611
00:35:21,166 --> 00:35:22,688
Scott: Those apples are going to taste like garbage.

612
00:35:22,728 --> 00:35:23,850
Scott: It'll be a crab apple tree.

613
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:30,294
Scott: The crab apple tree is actually even worse odds than the avocado tree.

614
00:35:30,314 --> 00:35:31,655
Scott: The avocado tree has better odds.

615
00:35:32,855 --> 00:35:34,356
Scott: And it's really bad odds to begin with.

616
00:35:34,376 --> 00:35:38,700
Scott: So the reason for this is something so obvious, it's just not something you think about.

617
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,462
Scott: It's that, hey, you know, the trees have sex.

618
00:35:42,823 --> 00:35:45,685
Scott: So the avocado seed, right?

619
00:35:45,965 --> 00:35:52,930
Scott: You know, the fruit that's on the tree, right, is based on the DNA of the mama tree, the one that's growing the fruit, right?

620
00:35:53,451 --> 00:36:00,139
Scott: But there's a daddy tree somewhere and the seed, even though the fruit always is made according to the mama tree, right?

621
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:08,270
Scott: The seed is combined, the mommy DNA and the daddy tree DNA that got pollinated from some bee or something when the trees are flowering.

622
00:36:08,831 --> 00:36:13,937
Scott: So that seed is only half good avocado and half who knows what.

623
00:36:14,518 --> 00:36:22,087
Scott: And even if both of those avocado trees are delicious avocado trees, you think, oh, well, I'll just have the really good Haas avocado.

624
00:36:22,107 --> 00:36:23,069
Scott: And what's another variety?

625
00:36:23,149 --> 00:36:24,210
Scott: I don't know some other variety.

626
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,702
Rym: Haas is the only one I know by name because that's the one I get.

627
00:36:26,722 --> 00:36:28,110
Rym: that's not my regular avocado.

628
00:36:29,011 --> 00:36:32,915
Scott: In this YouTube video, you can learn more varieties of avocado.

629
00:36:33,996 --> 00:36:36,398
Scott: And let's say two delicious trees get together.

630
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:38,540
Scott: In the video, he's like, well, that's great.

631
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:46,288
Scott: What if the, you know, caramel avocado tree and the winter green avocado tree get together?

632
00:36:46,308 --> 00:36:48,590
Scott: It's gonna taste like shit.

633
00:36:49,111 --> 00:36:58,908
Scott: So you need in order to grow an avocado tree that tastes good, you basically, you know, need to take a clipping from the mama tree and just clone the mama tree.

634
00:36:58,968 --> 00:37:00,050
Scott: That's how it's got to be done.

635
00:37:01,351 --> 00:37:02,052
Scott: And then you don't care.

636
00:37:02,092 --> 00:37:03,194
Scott: The seeds will all be garbage.

637
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:09,183
Scott: But, you know, or you can play the avocado lottery and start planting seeds and wait years and years and years for them to grow.

638
00:37:09,263 --> 00:37:13,850
Scott: And if you find one that tastes good, you'll be rich because you'll be able to sell a new avocado.

639
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:15,851
Rym: First YouTube comment.

640
00:37:15,911 --> 00:37:16,672
Rym: Most popular one.

641
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:18,033
Rym: You just saved me 10 years.

642
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:19,614
Scott: That's right.

643
00:37:19,634 --> 00:37:24,418
Scott: Because that's how long it takes avocado trees to grow.

644
00:37:24,458 --> 00:37:25,239
Scott: Terrific video.

645
00:37:25,299 --> 00:37:26,279
Scott: I learned about trees.

646
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:29,602
Rym: I like how direct and simple the explanation is.

647
00:37:29,662 --> 00:37:31,424
Rym: Like this guy just does a really good job.

648
00:37:31,884 --> 00:37:32,785
Scott: Makes common sense.

649
00:37:33,365 --> 00:37:35,447
Scott: And there's other good videos on this channel as well.

650
00:37:35,907 --> 00:37:37,989
Scott: And of course, they're selling their products.

651
00:37:38,009 --> 00:37:39,310
Scott: They'll sell you trees.

652
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:43,154
Rym: If you want to buy a graph to trees, we also sell 10 boxes of avocados.

653
00:37:44,054 --> 00:37:45,576
Scott: These guys, he sells, he sells anything.

654
00:37:45,616 --> 00:37:46,216
Scott: It's like you lazy.

655
00:37:46,236 --> 00:37:47,217
Scott: You just want the avocados.

656
00:37:47,257 --> 00:37:47,458
Scott: Fine.

657
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:48,839
Scott: We'll sell them to you on a whole tree.

658
00:37:48,859 --> 00:37:49,820
Scott: We'll sell you the whole tree.

659
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,501
Scott: You want a clipping because you got a bottom of it.

660
00:37:51,541 --> 00:37:54,624
Scott: You already planted a seed and you realize it's not going to work out.

661
00:37:54,965 --> 00:37:55,765
Scott: I'll sell you the clipping.

662
00:37:55,805 --> 00:37:56,826
Scott: You can graft onto it.

663
00:37:57,567 --> 00:37:59,048
Scott: He's like, they'll say any avocado.

664
00:37:59,849 --> 00:38:00,690
Scott: So any avocado.

665
00:38:01,471 --> 00:38:04,172
Scott: I just whacked my microphone.

666
00:38:04,673 --> 00:38:07,855
Rym: In the meantime, we're reading the tale of Genji for real.

667
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:08,635
Rym: Read along with us.

668
00:38:08,696 --> 00:38:09,636
Rym: It's the first novel.

669
00:38:10,717 --> 00:38:12,818
Scott: The first novel ever in human history.

670
00:38:12,858 --> 00:38:13,139
Scott: Yeah.

671
00:38:13,379 --> 00:38:14,339
Scott: The tale of Genji.

672
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,961
Scott: It's all about this one dude, Genji.

673
00:38:16,021 --> 00:38:16,801
Scott: And then I heard.

674
00:38:16,921 --> 00:38:18,102
Rym: He's not that great actually.

675
00:38:18,843 --> 00:38:20,864
Scott: Yeah, according to the spoilers that I've heard.

676
00:38:20,884 --> 00:38:22,445
Scott: because, you know, come on.

677
00:38:22,485 --> 00:38:23,766
Scott: Spoilers for the first novel.

678
00:38:23,866 --> 00:38:24,647
Scott: If there is any.

679
00:38:24,667 --> 00:38:28,449
Rym: I know one spoiler that I don't know if you know.

680
00:38:28,489 --> 00:38:29,610
Rym: I wonder if this is the spoiler.

681
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:36,395
Scott: The spoiler that I know is that he actually dies sometime before the end and there are volumes, the last few volumes.

682
00:38:36,415 --> 00:38:36,835
Scott: You know what it is?

683
00:38:36,855 --> 00:38:37,635
Scott: It's the second part of Death Note.

684
00:38:37,655 --> 00:38:38,436
Scott: Genji is not there.

685
00:38:38,456 --> 00:38:40,377
Scott: Right, exactly.

686
00:38:40,697 --> 00:38:42,759
Rym: Yeah, no, I knew that from a long time ago.

687
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:43,459
Rym: He just dies at some point.

688
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:45,961
Scott: I knew that from the museum exhibit we went to about the book.

689
00:38:45,981 --> 00:38:47,562
Scott: that made me choose this as the book club.

690
00:38:47,622 --> 00:38:47,842
Rym: Yep.

691
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:50,944
Rym: And there's like other characters come in and it just keeps trucking.

692
00:38:51,965 --> 00:38:53,226
Scott: Mm-hmm.

693
00:38:53,246 --> 00:38:59,330
Rym: So we'll see if it's a Death Note situation or a, I don't know, our Scott Bakker situation where the new characters are all over the place.

694
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:00,030
Rym: Also good.

695
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:00,491
Scott: Yeah.

696
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:04,714
Scott: Other meta moments, like I said in the thing of the day area, right?

697
00:39:04,754 --> 00:39:06,615
Scott: You should come and find us on the Internet.

698
00:39:06,915 --> 00:39:10,217
Scott: Our Discord server is increasing in activity.

699
00:39:10,838 --> 00:39:13,460
Scott: We got a forum which is maintaining its level of activity.

700
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,241
Scott: You can tweet at us.

701
00:39:15,361 --> 00:39:16,402
Scott: You can email us.

702
00:39:16,462 --> 00:39:16,802
Scott: You can.

703
00:39:17,182 --> 00:39:23,407
Rym: Every goddamn podcast we have ever made since 2005 is online, including the original forums.

704
00:39:23,447 --> 00:39:25,408
Rym: If you want to see our terrible takes from 2005.

705
00:39:25,408 --> 00:39:27,910
Scott: Oh, yeah, you can go to our old forum.

706
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:29,831
Rym: That happened in that old forum.

707
00:39:29,871 --> 00:39:30,872
Rym: They're all online.

708
00:39:31,633 --> 00:39:32,433
Scott: We have not.

709
00:39:32,853 --> 00:39:37,176
Scott: We have continued to archive everything and preserve everything.

710
00:39:37,196 --> 00:39:39,898
Scott: I'm sure you can find something to cancel us over.

711
00:39:40,379 --> 00:39:40,979
Scott: Please do.

712
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:42,160
Scott: I deserve it.

713
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,040
Scott: Right.

714
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:47,964
Scott: I will not say that I was I was right or make any excuse whatsoever.

715
00:39:48,044 --> 00:39:50,566
Scott: I will say, yes, that shitty GeekNights canceled.

716
00:39:50,586 --> 00:39:50,926
Scott: Goodbye.

717
00:39:52,687 --> 00:39:53,468
Scott: So go right ahead.

718
00:39:54,048 --> 00:39:55,349
Scott: We definitely said some shitty thing.

719
00:39:55,369 --> 00:39:55,849
Scott: Go find it.

720
00:39:55,909 --> 00:39:56,530
Scott: I'm not even joking.

721
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:56,990
Scott: All right.

722
00:39:57,090 --> 00:40:03,394
Scott: So free me from this podcast by finding something I said that was horrible and I admit was horrible.

723
00:40:03,795 --> 00:40:07,257
Rym: So we've done a show on the concept of single sign on.

724
00:40:08,418 --> 00:40:09,279
Rym: We've also done a show.

725
00:40:09,299 --> 00:40:16,944
Rym: We did a show on biometric, which is a kind of multi-factor authentication, but we mostly talked about use cases and like that technology in a vacuum.

726
00:40:17,564 --> 00:40:18,905
Scott: And we talked about passwords.

727
00:40:19,005 --> 00:40:23,749
Rym: Yeah, we've talked about passwords and we've definitely talked about multi-factor or two factor.

728
00:40:23,869 --> 00:40:24,870
Rym: But there can be more than two.

729
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:30,873
Rym: Many times on the show, but we've never done a show to actually like explain it in detail.

730
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:32,714
Rym: Like we never talked about it as the primary.

731
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:34,015
Scott: And we're out of ideas.

732
00:40:34,556 --> 00:40:36,857
Scott: And it's so important it's worth harping on repeated.

733
00:40:36,917 --> 00:40:41,300
Rym: It is because you have to understand how multi-factor works, at least on a basic level.

734
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:44,302
Rym: Or it's easy to fuck it up.

735
00:40:44,643 --> 00:40:47,465
Rym: It's easy to do things that aren't actually multi-factor.

736
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:52,288
Rym: Like you can make a whole career knowing the details of how multi-factor works.

737
00:40:52,608 --> 00:40:55,010
Rym: You could literally get an engineering job for the rest of your life.

738
00:40:56,770 --> 00:40:57,051
Scott: All right.

739
00:40:57,091 --> 00:41:00,093
Scott: So you want to access a computer system, right?

740
00:41:00,114 --> 00:41:02,376
Scott: Well, we only want to give access to certain people.

741
00:41:02,736 --> 00:41:07,280
Scott: They need to prove to us right through a computer that they are the person who they say they are.

742
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,601
Scott: Prove to me that you are Rym.

743
00:41:08,661 --> 00:41:10,343
Scott: I can't see Rym, so I don't know it's him.

744
00:41:10,403 --> 00:41:11,464
Scott: I'm not standing next to him.

745
00:41:11,904 --> 00:41:17,689
Scott: I just know that there is some computer out there that claims that Rym is sitting at that computer right now.

746
00:41:17,729 --> 00:41:18,230
Scott: Well, prove it.

747
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:22,153
Scott: Now, in the old days, you tell me something that only Rym knows.

748
00:41:22,173 --> 00:41:23,954
Rym: Well, hey, in the old days, you didn't even have that.

749
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:25,475
Rym: It was just someone.

750
00:41:25,535 --> 00:41:28,337
Rym: is someone has a terminal physically connected to this computer.

751
00:41:28,457 --> 00:41:29,217
Rym: It must be Rym.

752
00:41:29,257 --> 00:41:30,418
Rym: Who else has the key to that room?

753
00:41:31,279 --> 00:41:31,719
Scott: Exactly.

754
00:41:31,779 --> 00:41:33,060
Rym: Don't forget there was a pre-era.

755
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:39,024
Rym: But then the like a password really is just I know something that Scott is.

756
00:41:39,724 --> 00:41:42,686
Rym: Scott believes it is unlikely anyone else would know that thing.

757
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:47,930
Scott: So we just you were standing next to you were standing next to me in the computer lab.

758
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:51,673
Scott: You typed something in and I don't know what it is, but you do.

759
00:41:51,993 --> 00:41:53,234
Scott: No one else was in the room.

760
00:41:53,294 --> 00:41:54,294
Scott: No one else can know what it was.

761
00:41:54,315 --> 00:41:55,736
Scott: There were just dots on the screen.

762
00:41:55,776 --> 00:41:56,536
Scott: No one can see.

763
00:41:56,576 --> 00:42:00,439
Rym: you were typing what comes after fucking backyard, right?

764
00:42:00,739 --> 00:42:02,640
Scott: So if anyone else, right?

765
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:09,505
Scott: If anyone else types that in right when asked, then the odds of that being Rym are really high, right?

766
00:42:11,247 --> 00:42:14,269
Scott: However, that's not necessarily always good enough, right?

767
00:42:14,549 --> 00:42:16,150
Scott: Just tell me something only Rym knows.

768
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:19,252
Scott: Well, what if the thing only Rym knows is the word cat?

769
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:19,633
Rym: Yep.

770
00:42:20,733 --> 00:42:21,754
Rym: So I'll say this right now.

771
00:42:22,034 --> 00:42:28,279
Rym: When I'm making a password for something that is transient and it doesn't matter, I honestly I'll just say this publicly.

772
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:31,822
Rym: I just use the lower one letter, the lowercase letter A. That's the password I use.

773
00:42:32,342 --> 00:42:32,523
Scott: Yeah.

774
00:42:32,563 --> 00:42:35,245
Scott: Like, for example, we'll play like a game of root online.

775
00:42:35,325 --> 00:42:36,245
Scott: It's like a private game.

776
00:42:36,446 --> 00:42:37,907
Scott: We'll just use letter A is the password.

777
00:42:38,007 --> 00:42:42,290
Scott: It's like if someone bust into a root, if you bust into a root game, come on and play.

778
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:48,194
Rym: If someone packs into our root game because of this episode, sure, I'll play with you now because you went through that effort.

779
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,335
Rym: That is way more effort than we might.

780
00:42:50,596 --> 00:42:52,016
Scott: We might need a fourth player.

781
00:42:52,177 --> 00:42:53,017
Scott: You might need you.

782
00:42:53,137 --> 00:42:57,400
Scott: So that, you know, but it's like, yeah, the letter A is going to be fine because who cares if someone breaks it?

783
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:59,822
Rym: But if it's something real, like, say, my bank account.

784
00:43:00,102 --> 00:43:13,010
Rym: Well, if my if the thing I know is something that someone else can also know, there is no way for the bank to actually confirm if that is me or literally anyone else who can find that information.

785
00:43:13,691 --> 00:43:13,891
Scott: Right.

786
00:43:13,951 --> 00:43:16,052
Scott: So what we do is we do the something you have.

787
00:43:16,193 --> 00:43:16,373
Scott: Right.

788
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:17,694
Scott: So something you have.

789
00:43:17,754 --> 00:43:20,976
Scott: It'll be like the keys to your house or your ATM card.

790
00:43:21,016 --> 00:43:21,176
Scott: Right.

791
00:43:21,216 --> 00:43:23,778
Scott: So you think about used to multi-factor authentication all the time.

792
00:43:23,818 --> 00:43:24,678
Scott: You go to the ATM.

793
00:43:25,099 --> 00:43:27,220
Scott: You have to push in your card or bring your phone.

794
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:30,142
Scott: I bring my phone close to the ATM days with the NFC.

795
00:43:30,502 --> 00:43:32,183
Scott: But it's like you have to do something.

796
00:43:32,463 --> 00:43:34,765
Scott: Prove to the ATM that you have something.

797
00:43:34,885 --> 00:43:36,346
Scott: And then it asks you for the PIN number.

798
00:43:36,366 --> 00:43:38,487
Scott: It wants something, you know, something, you know, and have.

799
00:43:38,808 --> 00:43:45,172
Scott: And then it will spit out money because you better be the person who this money belongs to if we're going to spend money ahead of this machine.

800
00:43:45,472 --> 00:43:59,782
Rym: And for a long time, something you have was easy to do because computers are mostly used in serious places where they could, like, give you a special key card reader or a dongle or like they could give you a thing or like those RSA dongles that we'll talk about later.

801
00:44:00,002 --> 00:44:01,923
Scott: RSA dongles are big even in the 90s.

802
00:44:01,983 --> 00:44:02,263
Scott: Right.

803
00:44:02,283 --> 00:44:08,788
Scott: If you worked at a company, they would give you this little tiny keychain thing that had a little LCD readout like a like a Timex watch.

804
00:44:08,828 --> 00:44:10,629
Rym: This was so fancy for that era.

805
00:44:10,669 --> 00:44:11,109
Rym: Good lord.

806
00:44:11,209 --> 00:44:12,190
Scott: My dad, my dad had one.

807
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:13,071
Scott: I had numbers on it.

808
00:44:13,371 --> 00:44:15,893
Scott: And the numbers would change every once in a while.

809
00:44:16,013 --> 00:44:18,895
Rym: Every six to ten seconds, I want to say something like that.

810
00:44:18,975 --> 00:44:22,677
Scott: So it's like you're logging into your work laptop at home or even at work.

811
00:44:22,957 --> 00:44:25,399
Scott: And it's like, hey, type in the numbers on the thing.

812
00:44:25,419 --> 00:44:31,784
Scott: And if you can't type in the right numbers on that thing that are changing all the time, you must not be you.

813
00:44:32,004 --> 00:44:32,224
Scott: Right.

814
00:44:32,284 --> 00:44:40,850
Scott: It's like for someone to know the password, the secret that only Rym knows and be able to type in those numbers that are on a keychain that only Rym has.

815
00:44:41,493 --> 00:44:43,950
Scott: What are the odds that that's not Rym are really low?

816
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:46,010
Scott: Yeah, it's very, very secure.

817
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:47,790
Rym: But how does that actually work?

818
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:56,710
Rym: Because there are older systems and there are still systems where the device you're accessing from can physically inspect the something you have like an ATM.

819
00:44:57,112 --> 00:45:00,470
Rym: It can physically interrogate your actual physical phone right there.

820
00:45:00,873 --> 00:45:02,790
Rym: Or if you shove a card into it, it checks.

821
00:45:03,074 --> 00:45:03,582
Rym: Is that a card?

822
00:45:04,416 --> 00:45:05,209
Rym: Is there a chip in it?

823
00:45:05,311 --> 00:45:06,289
Rym: Is the chip the right chip?

824
00:45:06,551 --> 00:45:08,210
Rym: Yes, that is the physical thing I expected.

825
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:24,050
Rym: But when e-commerce and like the modern Internet came around, not all the attempts to get everyone to have like a fingerprint reader on their computer that was universal and standard or have a way to like put a credit card into a computer that never really came to pass.

826
00:45:24,971 --> 00:45:25,191
Scott: Yep.

827
00:45:25,331 --> 00:45:36,109
Scott: So we needed a new system to basically for people to have a thing right in, you know, in order to log in to be able to prove.

828
00:45:37,032 --> 00:45:41,150
Rym: Without connecting that thing to another thing that you have the thing.

829
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:48,209
Scott: And that is because otherwise every single person's computer is going to and phone and everything is going to have to have like some of the new hardware on it.

830
00:45:48,731 --> 00:45:49,369
Scott: What a pain in the butt.

831
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:49,750
Rym: Yep.

832
00:45:49,851 --> 00:45:56,610
Rym: And also that thing can't necessarily have a way to connect to anything on its own.

833
00:45:56,810 --> 00:46:02,670
Rym: Like if two factor authentication didn't work, if you didn't have cell signal, that fucking sucks and is not usable.

834
00:46:03,853 --> 00:46:06,989
Rym: It has to be able to work entirely independently of any other things.

835
00:46:07,870 --> 00:46:08,371
Scott: Right, exactly.

836
00:46:08,411 --> 00:46:18,450
Scott: So the system that we've come up with, you'll know it because you'll see it whenever you use Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator or Battle.net Authenticator or Steam Guard or any of those.

837
00:46:18,890 --> 00:46:24,330
Scott: They're all look a little bit different in terms of the size of the codes, but they all work fundamentally the same way.

838
00:46:24,912 --> 00:46:27,890
Scott: It's basically a time based one time pad.

839
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:34,230
Rym: There's a whole Wikipedia article you can read that will link to increasingly advanced algorithms for how this works.

840
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:40,250
Scott: Yes, there are increasingly advanced algorithms are going to simplify it a great deal to the point at which it's probably wrong.

841
00:46:40,351 --> 00:46:42,770
Scott: But the fundamentals are good enough for your understanding.

842
00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:45,269
Rym: I'm glad you put that disclaimer out because I was going to otherwise.

843
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:47,829
Rym: And you probably know the details better than I do.

844
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:48,672
Rym: You have.

845
00:46:48,692 --> 00:46:48,933
Scott: Right.

846
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:52,389
Scott: So what you do is the thing is some sort of secret key.

847
00:46:52,990 --> 00:46:53,413
Scott: Right.

848
00:46:53,434 --> 00:46:55,450
Scott: You know, we talked about public private keys in the past.

849
00:46:55,954 --> 00:46:57,909
Scott: So there's some secret key that you have.

850
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:04,589
Scott: And what you do is you take that secret key and you take the time, the time of day.

851
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:05,945
Scott: What time is it?

852
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:06,692
Scott: Right.

853
00:47:07,178 --> 00:47:08,089
Scott: It's it's noon.

854
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:17,330
Scott: And if you use that secret key at noon on March twenty ninth, twenty twenty one and you combine the two, it'll spit out a number.

855
00:47:18,012 --> 00:47:18,233
Scott: Right.

856
00:47:18,515 --> 00:47:21,029
Scott: If I try it again at noon tomorrow, it'll be a different number.

857
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:21,472
Scott: Right.

858
00:47:21,492 --> 00:47:22,849
Scott: Time and date together combined.

859
00:47:23,031 --> 00:47:23,211
Scott: Right.

860
00:47:24,116 --> 00:47:27,230
Scott: And so basically you just keep combining your private key and the time.

861
00:47:27,812 --> 00:47:31,029
Scott: And whenever you do that, you'll be able to spit out this number.

862
00:47:31,492 --> 00:47:31,773
Scott: Yeah.

863
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:34,650
Rym: So everyone who knows everyone and has the key.

864
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:35,053
Rym: Everyone.

865
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:36,410
Scott: Yeah.

866
00:47:36,591 --> 00:47:40,069
Scott: If you know what time everyone knows the time it is, but no one knows your secret key.

867
00:47:40,671 --> 00:47:40,932
Scott: Right.

868
00:47:41,353 --> 00:47:46,190
Scott: But if you combine the key and the time, you'll get the specific number.

869
00:47:47,152 --> 00:47:50,809
Scott: If you have the number, you can't figure out what the person's secret key is.

870
00:47:51,031 --> 00:47:52,470
Scott: You'll know that number.

871
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,009
Scott: I stole that number from you.

872
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:54,432
Scott: Great.

873
00:47:54,855 --> 00:47:57,130
Scott: But I can't generate more numbers.

874
00:47:57,370 --> 00:47:57,759
Scott: I won't.

875
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:58,169
Scott: I knew it.

876
00:47:58,591 --> 00:48:00,910
Scott: I looked at Rover Rims up, you know, shoulder.

877
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:01,512
Scott: Yeah.

878
00:48:01,533 --> 00:48:02,209
Scott: His Google off app.

879
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:04,990
Scott: And I saw his number was one, two, three, four, five, six at noon.

880
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:08,510
Scott: But later on, when I'm at home, I didn't steal Rym's phone.

881
00:48:08,951 --> 00:48:09,133
Rym: Yep.

882
00:48:09,455 --> 00:48:11,270
Scott: I can't log into his phone even if I did.

883
00:48:11,571 --> 00:48:16,290
Rym: But thirty seconds later, a different number comes out of that calculation that Scott can't calculate.

884
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:17,113
Scott: Exactly.

885
00:48:17,153 --> 00:48:20,070
Scott: So an hour when I get home, I try to log into Rym's email.

886
00:48:20,474 --> 00:48:20,655
Scott: Right.

887
00:48:20,716 --> 00:48:22,190
Scott: Which I can actually do for other reasons.

888
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:25,690
Scott: Regardless, I can't generate the number.

889
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:27,210
Scott: That number is not the right number anymore.

890
00:48:27,612 --> 00:48:27,937
Scott: Right.

891
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:28,689
Scott: I can't get in.

892
00:48:28,850 --> 00:48:34,690
Scott: I need to have that thing because the private key is in there and it won't spit out the private key itself.

893
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:35,550
Scott: Right.

894
00:48:36,011 --> 00:48:43,730
Scott: So unless I can like have a camera on Rym's phone while and see what it says while I'm logging in, which is really difficult.

895
00:48:45,053 --> 00:48:45,826
Scott: That's good enough.

896
00:48:45,948 --> 00:48:46,090
Scott: Right.

897
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:49,490
Scott: And now the person on the other end, the server, how does the server know the number is right?

898
00:48:49,973 --> 00:48:52,889
Scott: The server has the other half of the public private key.

899
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:53,491
Rym: Yep.

900
00:48:53,511 --> 00:48:57,270
Rym: The server can calculate those same numbers to know if the number you're sending is the right one.

901
00:48:57,430 --> 00:48:58,154
Scott: It doesn't count.

902
00:48:58,174 --> 00:49:00,730
Scott: The server doesn't calculate the same number.

903
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:01,491
Scott: Right.

904
00:49:01,511 --> 00:49:04,250
Scott: I guess it could, because like when you get the QR code on the screen.

905
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:05,574
Rym: I guess a simplified explanation would be.

906
00:49:05,855 --> 00:49:10,390
Rym: the computer also like knows what number to expect because it can calculate what number to expect.

907
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:10,953
Scott: Right.

908
00:49:10,974 --> 00:49:12,270
Scott: I guess you could do it both ways.

909
00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:15,679
Scott: I'm not sure which way they do it, but usually it's like that QR code.

910
00:49:15,699 --> 00:49:20,437
Scott: when you're using these apps, you'll take a photo of a QR code to add the private key into your phone.

911
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:22,309
Scott: That QR code is the private key.

912
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:25,090
Scott: So if someone else can see that QR code, they've got you.

913
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:26,109
Scott: You've got to make a new one.

914
00:49:26,473 --> 00:49:26,900
Rym: Yeah.

915
00:49:26,941 --> 00:49:27,389
Rym: Point of order.

916
00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:30,710
Rym: Don't like set up two factor like sitting in an airport.

917
00:49:31,692 --> 00:49:31,894
Scott: Yeah.

918
00:49:32,015 --> 00:49:33,490
Scott: Or when some of this camera's around.

919
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:33,711
Scott: Right.

920
00:49:33,752 --> 00:49:35,910
Scott: You got to make sure that you're the only one who sees that QR code.

921
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:38,830
Scott: Now, the server side generated that QR code.

922
00:49:39,211 --> 00:49:45,390
Scott: So I guess they could just store your private key and generate numbers and then match the numbers against each other.

923
00:49:45,891 --> 00:49:51,310
Scott: But then if someone accessed the server somehow, now they would have everyone's keys, which isn't great.

924
00:49:51,691 --> 00:49:57,350
Scott: What you would want to do on the server side is you would want to save the public private key.

925
00:49:57,590 --> 00:49:57,690
Scott: Right.

926
00:49:57,710 --> 00:50:03,710
Scott: You don't like a pair discard, you know, the other half that you the private part on the server side.

927
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:14,010
Scott: And then you now on the server, you don't have the user's keys, but you can verify due to, you know, the way digital crypto signing work.

928
00:50:14,030 --> 00:50:16,247
Rym: There's an old episode where we talked about that.

929
00:50:17,011 --> 00:50:17,133
Scott: Yeah.

930
00:50:17,194 --> 00:50:18,229
Scott: You can verify that.

931
00:50:18,451 --> 00:50:18,873
Scott: Ah, yes.

932
00:50:19,335 --> 00:50:22,529
Scott: That whoever made that number definitely has that key.

933
00:50:22,891 --> 00:50:25,370
Scott: But I don't have the original key, but I can still tell.

934
00:50:25,471 --> 00:50:25,592
Scott: Right.

935
00:50:25,632 --> 00:50:27,149
Scott: The same way that there's like a key and a lock.

936
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:29,090
Scott: You just only have the lock on your side.

937
00:50:29,612 --> 00:50:29,793
Scott: Right.

938
00:50:29,813 --> 00:50:32,750
Scott: And as long as no one impressions the lock, which you do because math.

939
00:50:33,131 --> 00:50:39,650
Rym: Now, the other part of this, that by itself would only be one factor because if someone stole the thing they're in.

940
00:50:40,652 --> 00:50:40,874
Scott: Yes.

941
00:50:40,914 --> 00:50:42,670
Scott: Someone steals your phone and it's unlocked.

942
00:50:42,811 --> 00:50:43,177
Scott: Guess what?

943
00:50:43,198 --> 00:50:43,889
Scott: They've got the numbers.

944
00:50:44,431 --> 00:50:48,276
Rym: So the reality is the two factors are everything we've described.

945
00:50:48,796 --> 00:50:59,470
Rym: and that thing, you know, the password, because the odds of someone being able to get both and exploit that access to both of them quickly enough are vanishingly low.

946
00:51:00,450 --> 00:51:00,550
Scott: Right.

947
00:51:00,571 --> 00:51:04,990
Scott: It's like the odds of someone stealing your key chain that has a thing on it, like a YubiKey.

948
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:05,614
Scott: Right.

949
00:51:05,674 --> 00:51:07,590
Scott: It's like not that low, actually.

950
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:08,254
Scott: That could happen.

951
00:51:08,355 --> 00:51:10,430
Rym: But it's useless if they don't also know my passwords.

952
00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:10,590
Rym: Right.

953
00:51:11,152 --> 00:51:18,470
Scott: Someone guessing your password, you know, assuming you're following the best password practices, hopefully low, but not impossible.

954
00:51:19,352 --> 00:51:22,650
Scott: You know, especially if there's like a password leak somewhere that happens a lot.

955
00:51:22,971 --> 00:51:24,289
Rym: Now, this is where it gets a little tricky.

956
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:30,110
Scott: There's someone getting your password from a password leak and stealing your key chain and it being the same person.

957
00:51:30,271 --> 00:51:30,412
Scott: Yeah.

958
00:51:30,432 --> 00:51:32,110
Scott: It's like, come on, that ain't happening.

959
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:32,717
Scott: You're safe.

960
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:33,408
Scott: Pretty safe.

961
00:51:33,857 --> 00:51:34,163
Rym: Not 100 percent.

962
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:44,830
Rym: But this is where it gets a little tricky because there are theoretically two fundamental ways to make it multi-factor, as in you have to have both the password, the thing you know, and the object, the key, the thing you have.

963
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:52,150
Rym: One way would be to make the password also be a component of the algorithm that generates the number.

964
00:51:53,810 --> 00:52:03,610
Rym: Another way to do it, which is much more common, is the thing you're logging into checks that the password is valid like normal, then it checks to see if you have the token.

965
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:11,750
Rym: But they're not actually like cryptographically tied to one another for a lot of reasons, because people change their key password frequently.

966
00:52:11,830 --> 00:52:17,310
Rym: A lot of people, you should change your passwords every now and then, but you don't want to change your private keys all the time.

967
00:52:17,431 --> 00:52:19,270
Rym: You don't change those unless they get compromised.

968
00:52:20,953 --> 00:52:26,410
Scott: Now, there are other algorithms and methods you can use besides just the simple time-based one, right?

969
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:36,710
Scott: So, for example, the YubiKey I mentioned, the YubiKey, which we've talked about in the way past, is basically it actually can work with the TOTP system, but it can work with other systems.

970
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:51,830
Scott: Basically, you plug it into a device or you put it near a device, either NFC or USB, and it has its own keys and it can spit out, right, by pretending to be a USB keyboard or just being an NFC device.

971
00:52:52,390 --> 00:52:57,430
Scott: It could just spit out the numbers directly into the computer or whatever, your phone or whatever you're trying to use.

972
00:52:57,430 --> 00:53:02,148
Rym: If I want to log into some things, I type in a password, I stick my USB key in, I hit the button, it logs me in.

973
00:53:03,131 --> 00:53:10,030
Scott: Yep, you know, sometimes it's like I log into something, I just hold my phone near my YubiKey and it's good to go.

974
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:14,807
Rym: And you know, I work in my whole career, I've worked in like high security environments, so I've had like other stuff.

975
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:23,010
Rym: One of the things I have now is a token that has biometric also in it, a third factor.

976
00:53:23,391 --> 00:53:32,770
Rym: But again, biometrics very rarely, as far as I'm aware, include any of the biometric data as part of generating that number or that hash or whatever it is it's generating.

977
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:42,250
Rym: They are also just a gate, like the token won't display the code unless it sees a valid fingerprint, then the code is validated through this other mechanism.

978
00:53:42,450 --> 00:53:44,190
Scott: Like usually it just makes life a little bit harder.

979
00:53:44,570 --> 00:53:46,310
Rym: Yeah, it does make life a little bit harder.

980
00:53:46,751 --> 00:53:55,410
Rym: Some systems do things like show a QR code on the screen right when you're going to log in and you hold your phone up to it and scan that QR code.

981
00:53:55,950 --> 00:54:04,290
Rym: Your device then uses that QR code, the time, whatever other factors it needs to use to generate the key to then type back into the screen you're looking at.

982
00:54:06,052 --> 00:54:07,609
Rym: That's a relatively common one.

983
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:14,050
Scott: So there are some slight weaknesses in the TOTP system, but not any that make it really insecure.

984
00:54:14,211 --> 00:54:16,530
Scott: They don't matter that much, but you should be aware of them.

985
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:23,249
Scott: So for example, you know, you open up your phone and it gives you like 30 seconds or whatever to look at the number before you type it in.

986
00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:27,250
Scott: Sometimes you don't type it in fast enough and you have to type in the next number, it sucks.

987
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:35,250
Rym: If someone gets too many of those numbers, every number they get theoretically decreases the time it would take to figure out your real key.

988
00:54:36,470 --> 00:54:37,729
Scott: Yeah, depending on stuff.

989
00:54:38,291 --> 00:54:39,549
Scott: We talked about news in the past.

990
00:54:39,790 --> 00:54:42,010
Scott: But by a tiny amount.

991
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:51,870
Scott: The systems though, it's like they have to sort of be like, listen, you know, they could just generate different numbers every one second, every millisecond if you wanted to.

992
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:54,450
Scott: But no, they give you like a 30 second window.

993
00:54:54,882 --> 00:54:55,050
Scott: Right.

994
00:54:55,110 --> 00:54:58,049
Scott: Just because humans need time to look at the number and type it in.

995
00:54:58,471 --> 00:55:03,710
Scott: And usually without saying so, they'll usually give you like a like a buffered zones.

996
00:55:03,851 --> 00:55:08,870
Scott: Like if you type it in and press enter at like the 31st or 32nd, you know, like you're a little bit late.

997
00:55:09,334 --> 00:55:10,189
Scott: It'll usually work.

998
00:55:10,451 --> 00:55:12,709
Rym: It's an old code, sir, but it checks out.

999
00:55:13,970 --> 00:55:28,530
Scott: There'll be a tiny window where like the the previous code and the next code will both work during this very brief time in between to account for people typing in codes too fast or too slow just because to make it nice for humans.

1000
00:55:28,811 --> 00:55:32,490
Scott: And it's not a significant vulnerability, really.

1001
00:55:32,851 --> 00:55:34,190
Rym: But it is what it opens you up.

1002
00:55:34,490 --> 00:55:35,450
Scott: You were really going to be strict.

1003
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:36,328
Scott: You wouldn't have that.

1004
00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:42,241
Rym: That window, really, what it opens you up to are operational security attacks.

1005
00:55:42,541 --> 00:55:47,450
Rym: where someone will have a fake website, let's say you try to log into it thinking it's the real website.

1006
00:55:47,835 --> 00:55:49,110
Rym: You just gave them your password.

1007
00:55:49,314 --> 00:55:50,270
Rym: So you're fucked there.

1008
00:55:50,810 --> 00:56:02,950
Rym: But then they will try to log into the real site on your behalf and then they will reach out to you either in that same website to get you to type in the code from your two factor device.

1009
00:56:03,153 --> 00:56:03,445
Rym: Exactly.

1010
00:56:03,850 --> 00:56:04,390
Rym: Giving them everything.

1011
00:56:04,791 --> 00:56:11,662
Scott: If you accidentally go to goggle.com, right, you type in your username and password, it looks exactly like google.com.

1012
00:56:12,063 --> 00:56:16,470
Scott: and then a thing pops up and is like, type in your code, you type in your code from your phone.

1013
00:56:16,670 --> 00:56:18,229
Scott: It's like, well, they didn't get your private key.

1014
00:56:18,733 --> 00:56:20,670
Scott: They can't generate codes anymore.

1015
00:56:21,262 --> 00:56:21,430
Scott: Right.

1016
00:56:21,530 --> 00:56:23,233
Scott: But but they were.

1017
00:56:23,414 --> 00:56:31,230
Scott: if they act fast enough, right, with the code you just gave them because there's a 30 second window, they just logged in as you and they can now change.

1018
00:56:31,371 --> 00:56:34,170
Scott: They can try to change a password, maybe depending if it lets them.

1019
00:56:34,930 --> 00:56:44,150
Rym: The other times the other main operational attack on that specific that like that angle is along the lines of using the recovery mechanisms for if you lost your key.

1020
00:56:44,870 --> 00:56:47,770
Scott: Because again, so we have to talk about the recovery mechanism.

1021
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:48,104
Scott: Right.

1022
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:52,770
Scott: So basically it's like, what if I legitimately my phone explodes?

1023
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:53,348
Scott: Right.

1024
00:56:53,491 --> 00:56:54,729
Scott: I was using the app on my phone.

1025
00:56:54,930 --> 00:56:56,329
Scott: All my private keys were in the phone.

1026
00:56:56,514 --> 00:56:57,049
Scott: I was smart.

1027
00:56:57,151 --> 00:56:59,089
Scott: I didn't put the private keys anywhere else.

1028
00:56:59,355 --> 00:56:59,669
Scott: Right.

1029
00:56:59,951 --> 00:57:05,450
Scott: Which would be unsafe because that means that someone else could like, you know, if I haven't been my phone, that's on my person.

1030
00:57:05,850 --> 00:57:09,770
Rym: If you get into my net, there's actually an encrypted file that has those keys on it.

1031
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:11,370
Rym: And if you decrypt, that's not a bad place.

1032
00:57:11,531 --> 00:57:12,129
Scott: Yeah, that's fine.

1033
00:57:12,330 --> 00:57:12,430
Scott: Yeah.

1034
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:17,059
Rym: The odds of if someone breaks into my house, like already, I'm way beyond.

1035
00:57:17,079 --> 00:57:22,230
Scott: the point is if you if you had like, you know, several phones that had it on there, it's like every phone.

1036
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:25,029
Scott: It's like, you know, you wouldn't notice if your fifth phone was stolen.

1037
00:57:25,215 --> 00:57:25,470
Scott: Yeah.

1038
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:28,710
Scott: That if you put the same codes in all of them, that could be a danger.

1039
00:57:28,879 --> 00:57:29,070
Scott: Right.

1040
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:30,735
Scott: Because then they could just they don't even need to.

1041
00:57:30,755 --> 00:57:35,330
Scott: if they don't change your password or do anything, they could keep like logging in and reading your emails forever.

1042
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:36,688
Scott: You wouldn't notice.

1043
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:37,170
Scott: Yeah.

1044
00:57:37,571 --> 00:57:41,550
Scott: But you could let's say you have it on your one phone and your phone actually breaks.

1045
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:43,410
Scott: That happened to me one time I was on my bike.

1046
00:57:43,490 --> 00:57:46,309
Scott: I fell on the phone broke because even those in my bag.

1047
00:57:47,095 --> 00:57:47,770
Scott: What do you do now?

1048
00:57:47,850 --> 00:57:50,667
Scott: You can't log in anything even though you're definitely you.

1049
00:57:51,411 --> 00:57:53,234
Rym: Now, most why just generate?

1050
00:57:53,374 --> 00:58:02,430
Rym: they let you generate like 10 or five keys that will always work no matter what time it is, but they'll only work for your account and they'll only work once each.

1051
00:58:03,204 --> 00:58:03,309
Scott: Yep.

1052
00:58:03,370 --> 00:58:05,109
Scott: So you get this piece of paper that you print out.

1053
00:58:05,331 --> 00:58:07,410
Scott: Usually I recommend printing an actual piece of paper.

1054
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:17,430
Scott: It has all these codes on it and it's like, all right, well, if I somehow lose my phone, I have 20 chances or whatever to log into Google with one of these codes.

1055
00:58:17,612 --> 00:58:19,090
Scott: If I use a code, that's it.

1056
00:58:19,210 --> 00:58:19,989
Scott: That code is gone.

1057
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:20,890
Scott: Right.

1058
00:58:21,071 --> 00:58:25,248
Scott: Which means I have to get a new phone and set it up within 20 logins.

1059
00:58:26,351 --> 00:58:30,530
Rym: One time I had a two factor thing fail me while I was in Turkey for an extended business trip.

1060
00:58:31,491 --> 00:58:37,030
Rym: So I basically used my codes one by one to get into a system over the course of a week.

1061
00:58:37,451 --> 00:58:38,550
Rym: And then I reset everything.

1062
00:58:38,610 --> 00:58:41,050
Rym: When I got back home and got a new phone, it works.

1063
00:58:41,331 --> 00:58:41,868
Rym: Yeah, it did work.

1064
00:58:41,990 --> 00:58:43,990
Rym: But I was like rationing those codes.

1065
00:58:44,050 --> 00:58:45,350
Rym: Like, do I really need to log in now?

1066
00:58:45,390 --> 00:58:48,509
Rym: Or can it wait till I get back to the hotel where I already trusted this device?

1067
00:58:49,259 --> 00:58:49,450
Scott: Yeah.

1068
00:58:49,590 --> 00:58:56,781
Scott: But yeah, the emergency backup codes are, you should definitely, if you haven't gotten the emergency backup codes for every single.

1069
00:58:56,981 --> 00:59:03,070
Scott: look at your app in your phone, your Google authenticator app, whatever authenticator app you have, you know, look at all the apps listed there.

1070
00:59:03,871 --> 00:59:07,050
Scott: Make sure you have backup codes for every single one of those.

1071
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:13,430
Scott: Because if you don't write, for example, discord, I had a discord account way back in the day.

1072
00:59:14,011 --> 00:59:20,390
Scott: And I law, I not only lost the, uh, the thing in my phone, but I never had backup codes.

1073
00:59:20,770 --> 00:59:21,950
Scott: I can't log into that account.

1074
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:25,670
Scott: I can only log into my newer second discord account.

1075
00:59:25,850 --> 00:59:29,470
Scott: And if the site is doing nothing important on that account, so it doesn't matter.

1076
00:59:29,590 --> 00:59:35,650
Rym: But, you know, if a site or service is doing like what I would consider good proper security, there is literally no way to get that account back.

1077
00:59:35,970 --> 00:59:41,510
Scott: There should, if it's properly done, there should be no backup mechanism beyond the backup codes.

1078
00:59:42,133 --> 00:59:44,490
Rym: And I'll turn one exception to that.

1079
00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:49,270
Rym: I would say is certain things where there is a like physical security component.

1080
00:59:49,450 --> 01:00:01,550
Rym: Like for example, a bank, I go to my bank physically with my passport and be like, I am actually Rym and I need to reset the crypto on my account or be a con artist with disguises and a fake passport.

1081
01:00:01,850 --> 01:00:01,925
Rym: Yup.

1082
01:00:02,070 --> 01:00:05,829
Rym: But ideally the barrier to entry, cause there I have to prove that I'm me.

1083
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:11,027
Rym: If someone is able to prove to a banks, uh, which this can happen, like some bank branch.

1084
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:13,747
Scott: Cash me if you can.

1085
01:00:14,450 --> 01:00:14,546
Rym: Yup.

1086
01:00:14,631 --> 01:00:15,629
Rym: Like that could happen.

1087
01:00:15,970 --> 01:00:24,250
Rym: That's why this is a, there's always the battle between better security makes things a pain in the ass for normal people, but it's better security.

1088
01:00:24,470 --> 01:00:27,589
Rym: You have to figure out where that line should be for yourself and for your things.

1089
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:33,770
Scott: More realistically, like I'm at work and somehow my phone explodes, but I need to log into my work shit.

1090
01:00:34,812 --> 01:00:36,930
Scott: So I go to the it guy at work.

1091
01:00:37,093 --> 01:00:37,809
Scott: He sees me.

1092
01:00:37,930 --> 01:00:38,769
Scott: He knows who I am.

1093
01:00:39,032 --> 01:00:39,650
Scott: Just like, okay.

1094
01:00:39,731 --> 01:00:41,628
Scott: He logs in as admin and fixes it.

1095
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:42,265
Scott: The end.

1096
01:00:42,870 --> 01:00:48,530
Rym: I can do something similar at my job, but there were some secure systems where short of coming physically into an office.

1097
01:00:49,372 --> 01:00:51,789
Rym: Uh, when I worked at a broker, there was literally no way.

1098
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:56,049
Scott: If you, if you lose, if you lose the backup codes, you should have to go to the office.

1099
01:00:56,231 --> 01:00:57,970
Rym: It went like you would have to physically go to the office.

1100
01:00:58,030 --> 01:01:02,370
Rym: And if you're on a business trip or you're going to be in a lot of trouble when you get back, you fucked it up.

1101
01:01:03,163 --> 01:01:03,290
Scott: Yeah.

1102
01:01:03,411 --> 01:01:05,230
Scott: But that's, I think that's the correct way to do it.

1103
01:01:05,390 --> 01:01:09,670
Rym: The backup mechanisms that are not that piece of paper are very common.

1104
01:01:10,051 --> 01:01:12,250
Rym: Oftentimes people will say, Oh yeah, give us your phone numbers.

1105
01:01:12,472 --> 01:01:13,330
Rym: So there's an SMS backup.

1106
01:01:13,913 --> 01:01:14,579
Rym: If there is any.

1107
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:19,030
Rym: Automated way to get around the two factor.

1108
01:01:19,352 --> 01:01:20,770
Rym: You don't actually have to factor anymore.

1109
01:01:21,032 --> 01:01:23,230
Rym: And SMS is not two factor.

1110
01:01:23,370 --> 01:01:27,410
Rym: It is so trivial to exploit SMS two factor.

1111
01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:36,090
Rym: Like I, it, it, it, if, if SMS exists to be used in any capacity to log into something, that thing is completely insecure in my opinion.

1112
01:01:37,010 --> 01:01:42,310
Rym: So even my fucking bank will like SMS me a code and there's no way around that chase.

1113
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:42,947
Rym: I'm talking to you.

1114
01:01:43,671 --> 01:01:44,770
Scott: We've talked about this before.

1115
01:01:44,870 --> 01:01:46,070
Scott: It bears repeating, right?

1116
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:46,628
Rym: Also bam.

1117
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:47,870
Scott: Yeah.

1118
01:01:48,190 --> 01:01:58,310
Scott: It is easy, trivially, scarily easy to convince cell phone providers to move a phone number from one SIM card to another.

1119
01:01:58,610 --> 01:02:06,550
Scott: So someone, you know, I have a Verizon, I have enabled like a pin number and I get higher security and extra locking on my account.

1120
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:11,930
Scott: Theoretically, somebody would have a hard time getting my number transferred to their SIM card.

1121
01:02:12,753 --> 01:02:14,270
Scott: This is not enabled by default.

1122
01:02:14,818 --> 01:02:15,570
Scott: It's not good enough.

1123
01:02:15,711 --> 01:02:17,789
Scott: Even if it is enabled, you can get around it.

1124
01:02:17,991 --> 01:02:20,750
Rym: I read a lot about those kinds of exploits, right?

1125
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:27,690
Scott: If someone's sweet talks, Verizon on the phone gets the right operator, they will just move your phone number to someone else's phone.

1126
01:02:28,031 --> 01:02:34,290
Scott: And now they get the text message with the secret number in it and they're not you, but, and if they have your password, guess what?

1127
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:37,590
Scott: They're logging in as you now without even having to steal your phone or anything.

1128
01:02:37,690 --> 01:02:51,490
Scott: So if the backup to your action, if you have two factor authentication set up with TOTP and like the Google auth app or whatever, and there's a backup mechanism that's not the piece of paper with numbers on it, it's the backup mechanism is text messages.

1129
01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:52,024
Scott: Well, guess what?

1130
01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:53,493
Scott: You're that's all.

1131
01:02:53,534 --> 01:02:57,430
Scott: that might as well be your main mechanism because any attacker can just use that.

1132
01:02:57,770 --> 01:03:03,650
Rym: So for a lot of things, my backup mechanism mechanism is a second YubiKey that I have that is stored somewhere secure.

1133
01:03:04,452 --> 01:03:05,990
Scott: I have, I have two YubiKeys.

1134
01:03:06,713 --> 01:03:07,347
Rym: I also have two.

1135
01:03:08,190 --> 01:03:09,188
Scott: And I basically what I did.

1136
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:14,110
Scott: So originally the problem was, is that, okay, I got a phone, right?

1137
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:18,570
Scott: I put all the codes into the app that I buy and then I get a new phone.

1138
01:03:18,950 --> 01:03:21,510
Scott: There is usually no way to transfer.

1139
01:03:21,710 --> 01:03:24,470
Scott: I think they've added it over time to Google Authenticator.

1140
01:03:24,630 --> 01:03:26,283
Rym: Not that I use it anymore, but I'm not a fan.

1141
01:03:27,290 --> 01:03:32,030
Scott: I'm not a fan of that because it means somebody who accesses it can now transfer to their phone, right?

1142
01:03:32,491 --> 01:03:33,410
Scott: Theoretically, I guess.

1143
01:03:34,792 --> 01:03:36,330
Scott: So I don't like that what I want.

1144
01:03:36,470 --> 01:03:39,509
Scott: Those keys should not be transferable out of wherever they are.

1145
01:03:40,492 --> 01:03:40,833
Scott: Right.

1146
01:03:40,853 --> 01:03:45,570
Scott: So the problem was when you get a new phone, you have to redo everything.

1147
01:03:45,910 --> 01:03:48,710
Rym: So I'm going to tell you a secret, a hack that you can do.

1148
01:03:48,850 --> 01:03:49,231
Rym: That's easy.

1149
01:03:49,571 --> 01:03:56,766
Rym: If you have two phones, you can set up two factor use, even if the company you're setting it up with only supports one device.

1150
01:03:57,067 --> 01:03:58,750
Rym: and just take a picture of that QR code twice.

1151
01:03:59,473 --> 01:04:01,390
Scott: Yeah, take a picture of the QR code with each phone.

1152
01:04:01,450 --> 01:04:02,698
Rym: It'll totally work to.

1153
01:04:02,859 --> 01:04:04,390
Scott: now you've got two sets of keys.

1154
01:04:04,691 --> 01:04:04,932
Scott: Right.

1155
01:04:05,275 --> 01:04:07,650
Scott: Once you close that QR code out and you don't see it anymore.

1156
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:08,011
Scott: That's it.

1157
01:04:08,051 --> 01:04:08,393
Scott: You're done.

1158
01:04:08,433 --> 01:04:12,110
Scott: You can't add you can't make more keys, but it's like making extra keys to your house.

1159
01:04:12,192 --> 01:04:12,314
Scott: Right.

1160
01:04:12,334 --> 01:04:13,049
Scott: In case you lose one.

1161
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:15,550
Scott: So and Yubikey's right.

1162
01:04:15,690 --> 01:04:18,430
Scott: You can actually using a phone as like a go between.

1163
01:04:18,711 --> 01:04:20,109
Scott: So Yubikey added this.

1164
01:04:20,270 --> 01:04:22,590
Scott: I don't know when, but it works really well.

1165
01:04:22,670 --> 01:04:23,091
Scott: I tried it.

1166
01:04:23,833 --> 01:04:24,334
Scott: You what you.

1167
01:04:24,354 --> 01:04:31,290
Scott: the way it works is you take a picture of the QR code with your phone and then you wave your phone.

1168
01:04:31,390 --> 01:04:36,870
Scott: It near the Yubikey and it actually will put the private key into the Yubikey.

1169
01:04:37,130 --> 01:04:37,733
Rym: That's what I got.

1170
01:04:37,773 --> 01:04:40,969
Rym: So if so, I can use any phone to get my keys.

1171
01:04:41,810 --> 01:04:45,730
Scott: The Yubikey has enough storage space in it to hold a certain number of keys.

1172
01:04:45,830 --> 01:04:46,718
Scott: It can't hold infinity.

1173
01:04:46,981 --> 01:04:47,949
Scott: It's a tiny little guy.

1174
01:04:48,131 --> 01:04:48,313
Scott: Right.

1175
01:04:48,818 --> 01:04:49,910
Scott: But it can hold quite a few.

1176
01:04:50,050 --> 01:04:53,890
Scott: So all your most used, most important keys you can put into the Yubikey.

1177
01:04:54,130 --> 01:05:00,470
Scott: And if you get several Yubikeys, you can take a picture of the QR code and put it into several keys all at the start.

1178
01:05:00,814 --> 01:05:01,889
Scott: So you have backup Yubikeys.

1179
01:05:02,150 --> 01:05:09,010
Scott: And now that Yubikey, if someone gets your phone and they open the Yubikey app, they won't see any number.

1180
01:05:09,110 --> 01:05:10,608
Rym: It just says, please tap your Yubikey.

1181
01:05:11,210 --> 01:05:18,830
Scott: Yeah, you have to tap the Yubikey and then the phone will read the keys out of the Yubikey and generate one set of numbers.

1182
01:05:19,611 --> 01:05:24,950
Scott: And then once it's done with those numbers, the 30 seconds have passed, the numbers will be gone.

1183
01:05:25,150 --> 01:05:26,830
Scott: You have to tap the Yubikey again.

1184
01:05:26,950 --> 01:05:31,750
Rym: So like if Scott lost, like if Scott's phone blew up and we were at a PAX, I could hand him my phone.

1185
01:05:32,051 --> 01:05:34,289
Rym: He could swipe, just tap his Yubikey to it.

1186
01:05:34,592 --> 01:05:35,689
Rym: He could do whatever he needs to do.

1187
01:05:35,892 --> 01:05:36,910
Rym: And I don't get dick.

1188
01:05:37,131 --> 01:05:38,890
Rym: I don't get any way to exploit.

1189
01:05:38,990 --> 01:05:42,750
Scott: You can use, I can take my Yubikey and put it into my computer.

1190
01:05:43,032 --> 01:05:45,450
Scott: And there's an app on the computer that generates the numbers.

1191
01:05:45,570 --> 01:05:47,210
Scott: Now I don't need to have my phone near my computer.

1192
01:05:47,650 --> 01:05:48,330
Scott: That app is great.

1193
01:05:48,490 --> 01:05:52,530
Scott: I can just, I can just copy and paste from this little app that's running on my desktop.

1194
01:05:53,151 --> 01:06:03,190
Scott: And if there's any apps on my computer that happen to use the more secure non TOTP methods that Yubikey supports, I can just push the button on the Yubikey to activate those.

1195
01:06:04,592 --> 01:06:04,712
Scott: Right.

1196
01:06:04,913 --> 01:06:10,570
Scott: So it's really, you know, when I first got the Yubikey, because we got the first ones way back in the Beacon days.

1197
01:06:10,971 --> 01:06:11,903
Rym: Yeah, those were cool.

1198
01:06:13,530 --> 01:06:15,150
Scott: Those were just USB keyboards.

1199
01:06:15,412 --> 01:06:18,310
Scott: They only had one mode and not too many things supported them.

1200
01:06:18,430 --> 01:06:20,570
Scott: I was really only using them with like my WordPress blogs.

1201
01:06:21,051 --> 01:06:26,570
Scott: Which weren't high value targets, but WordPress is so insecure and it's so many vulnerabilities all the time.

1202
01:06:26,970 --> 01:06:31,150
Scott: I wanted to add that extra level on it just to save myself the hassle of it getting nailed.

1203
01:06:32,733 --> 01:06:35,270
Scott: But yeah, they became not very useful.

1204
01:06:35,410 --> 01:06:37,070
Scott: That original Yubikey isn't that useful.

1205
01:06:37,311 --> 01:06:39,090
Scott: And it once TOTP became a standard.

1206
01:06:39,572 --> 01:06:43,130
Scott: But now the new Yubikey support TOTP and a host of other things.

1207
01:06:43,470 --> 01:06:45,236
Scott: Yeah, I highly recommend them.

1208
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:48,447
Scott: get to and put all, just do it once.

1209
01:06:49,310 --> 01:06:58,030
Scott: It'll take you a while, like maybe an hour or two, depending on the apps you have and sites you use, but just redo all your 2FA onto two Yubikeys.

1210
01:06:58,190 --> 01:07:07,650
Scott: Put one of them somewhere safe, put the other one on your keychain and like, you'll be so good and so happy when your phone, when you replace your phone, you won't have to do this ever again.

1211
01:07:08,010 --> 01:07:13,810
Rym: So Scott, what if someone copies my Yubikey and then tries to brute force?

1212
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,229
Scott: How can they copy the Yubikey?

1213
01:07:16,656 --> 01:07:20,170
Scott: So the final Yubikey will not spit out the private keys.

1214
01:07:20,670 --> 01:07:21,454
Rym: So there is.

1215
01:07:21,555 --> 01:07:24,168
Rym: there is a sidechain attack on Yubikeys.

1216
01:07:25,032 --> 01:07:29,230
Rym: Oh, this is Bruce Schneier's blog has a really detailed breakdown of this.

1217
01:07:29,491 --> 01:07:30,987
Rym: This is from January of this year.

1218
01:07:31,952 --> 01:07:34,669
Rym: Oh, I was saving this one for this is a good news.

1219
01:07:35,591 --> 01:07:41,705
Rym: So it is demonstrably possible to exploit a vulnerability because remember that these.

1220
01:07:41,745 --> 01:07:43,670
Rym: Yubikey is like any security key like this.

1221
01:07:43,973 --> 01:07:45,390
Rym: It's not just a USB stick.

1222
01:07:45,711 --> 01:07:47,429
Rym: You can't just like read the data out of it.

1223
01:07:47,731 --> 01:07:51,269
Rym: These are chips that are designed to not let you fuck with them.

1224
01:07:52,471 --> 01:07:53,309
Rym: Like it is very Apple.

1225
01:07:53,510 --> 01:07:53,956
Scott: You're right.

1226
01:07:53,976 --> 01:07:54,950
Scott: Your iOS devices.

1227
01:07:55,150 --> 01:07:57,950
Scott: You know how Apple always brags about like their secure enclave?

1228
01:07:58,213 --> 01:07:58,517
Scott: Right.

1229
01:07:58,760 --> 01:07:59,570
Scott: Very similar.

1230
01:07:59,970 --> 01:08:00,092
Scott: Yeah.

1231
01:08:00,152 --> 01:08:01,510
Scott: Like very similar in concept.

1232
01:08:02,010 --> 01:08:07,170
Rym: So these chips, the reason they can only hold so many because you might be thinking, wait, these keys are just a QR code.

1233
01:08:07,210 --> 01:08:09,528
Rym: Why can you only fit like 20 of them on a Yubikey?

1234
01:08:09,811 --> 01:08:12,110
Rym: Because they're not stored in like a file system.

1235
01:08:12,493 --> 01:08:14,529
Scott: They're stored on a flash drive in there.

1236
01:08:14,751 --> 01:08:17,470
Rym: Yeah, they're stored in specialized hardware.

1237
01:08:18,109 --> 01:08:21,010
Rym: Then you could learning a lot about that hardware will give you a career.

1238
01:08:21,611 --> 01:08:28,470
Rym: However, here is the attack by observing the electromagnetic magnetic radiation in the chip.

1239
01:08:28,529 --> 01:08:40,270
Rym: If you get a hold of someone's Yubikey or any of these keys that use the A700X NXP chip, it takes about 10 hours of analysis and you've got the key effectively.

1240
01:08:40,712 --> 01:08:42,647
Rym: Twelve thousand dollars worth of equipment, 10 hours.

1241
01:08:43,569 --> 01:08:46,890
Scott: So if your key is missing for 10 hours, reset everything.

1242
01:08:47,229 --> 01:08:47,350
Rym: Yes.

1243
01:08:47,874 --> 01:08:50,810
Rym: So the interesting thing is you might think, how could that possibly happen?

1244
01:08:51,850 --> 01:08:54,770
Rym: What if you are a moderately high value target?

1245
01:08:54,870 --> 01:08:57,430
Rym: Like you're not going after a Rym and Scott, you're not trying to get GeekNights.

1246
01:08:57,590 --> 01:09:04,250
Rym: You're trying to get like someone a little bit higher up in the chain and that person who works at a bank, just some guy who works at a bank.

1247
01:09:04,350 --> 01:09:09,439
Rym: And let's say that person like me has the Yubikey on the key chain, but that person's rich and has a car.

1248
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:15,990
Rym: that's fancy and they drive that car to a restaurant or hotel and hand their keys to a valet.

1249
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:31,250
Scott: If that valet is set up to just take that, if that valet took those keys for maybe, I don't know, they're at a convention all weekend and the cars in the garage, all these keys, they do this analysis, they replace the keys.

1250
01:09:32,493 --> 01:09:34,470
Rym: There is a vulnerability there.

1251
01:09:35,149 --> 01:09:42,029
Rym: I don't think you need to worry about that vulnerability, but you need to understand that these kinds of things exist.

1252
01:09:42,210 --> 01:09:48,470
Rym: We did a show ancient times about like just levels of paranoia, like how paranoid should you be about your security?

1253
01:09:48,911 --> 01:10:00,810
Rym: I'm not saying you need to worry about this attack, but you should make sure that if you have a key of any kind, don't let it leave your like the spaces.

1254
01:10:00,951 --> 01:10:03,028
Rym: You control for long periods of time.

1255
01:10:04,170 --> 01:10:09,010
Scott: Yeah, I mean, a valet could just, you know, cars now have those more advanced little chips in the car keys.

1256
01:10:09,430 --> 01:10:14,090
Rym: Yeah, but they could take your, like, if I'd leave my car there, they could just copy the key and come back later and steal my car.

1257
01:10:14,290 --> 01:10:16,770
Scott: To copy just a physical key takes no time at all.

1258
01:10:17,090 --> 01:10:20,290
Scott: I mean, I would not be, there's definitely got to be somewhere in history where...

1259
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:21,170
Rym: So it's even more moot.

1260
01:10:21,410 --> 01:10:27,950
Rym: I learned something fascinating about New York City garages, like any of them, because you leave your keys with them, right?

1261
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:29,150
Rym: Because they move the cars around a lot.

1262
01:10:29,190 --> 01:10:31,110
Rym: Like they don't just leave your car in a spot.

1263
01:10:31,410 --> 01:10:37,550
Rym: If you don't come to get your car for a few days, they like bury it in this like mechanical monstrosity behind 20 other cars.

1264
01:10:38,331 --> 01:10:38,630
Scott: That's right.

1265
01:10:39,190 --> 01:10:55,250
Rym: So if you go to pretty much any garage in New York that has monthly or like weekly or annual parking, and you know how that garage references a specific car, and you ask for that car, and you sound plausible, they will likely just go get that car and hand you the keys and walk away.

1266
01:10:57,631 --> 01:11:03,309
Rym: I noticed that because I, for now, have a car parked in a garage, and I saw how that security works.

1267
01:11:05,150 --> 01:11:11,549
Scott: So if you just know a car, like, ah, yes, and I guess if they're super friendly with the person or they know the car...

1268
01:11:11,910 --> 01:11:15,269
Rym: So you go pick up the car at a weird time, like you gotta wait for them to face out.

1269
01:11:15,450 --> 01:11:18,249
Scott: You monitor the garage, you wait for there to be a new employee.

1270
01:11:18,792 --> 01:11:22,590
Rym: Or, yeah, like if it's like you're going after a target, fine.

1271
01:11:22,830 --> 01:11:33,249
Rym: Like if it's a white banker dude, just look close enough to white banker dude and go up and be very like, yeah, I'm here for the, uh, pick up my Lambo.

1272
01:11:34,990 --> 01:11:35,807
Rym: Come on, come on.

1273
01:11:36,090 --> 01:11:36,509
Rym: I'm in a hurry.

1274
01:11:37,551 --> 01:11:38,244
Rym: Come on.

1275
01:11:39,271 --> 01:11:47,230
Rym: But, uh, like this article really just highlights that security, like in the end, if someone gets physical access to a thing.

1276
01:11:47,715 --> 01:11:48,889
Rym: It's only a matter of time.

1277
01:11:50,010 --> 01:11:52,990
Rym: Physical security is the final type of security.

1278
01:11:54,050 --> 01:11:54,845
Scott: Observed security.

1279
01:11:56,490 --> 01:12:09,190
Scott: If you do attempt to steal a car in this manner, uh, make sure you steal a car belonging to someone who is somewhat your height and length so that you, if you adjust the seat after you pick the car up, that won't look good.

1280
01:12:09,670 --> 01:12:10,506
Rym: Yep, yep.

1281
01:12:10,970 --> 01:12:15,370
Rym: Granted, uh, the other way is find a car that a lot of people are sharing.

1282
01:12:16,011 --> 01:12:18,710
Scott: That'll be a Sherlock's home, like mystery novel thing.

1283
01:12:19,212 --> 01:12:21,450
Scott: He adjusted the seat when he picked the car up.

1284
01:12:21,651 --> 01:12:22,169
Scott: That's how we knew.

1285
01:12:22,330 --> 01:12:31,370
Rym: But people call these concepts two different, like a bunch of different things, but the idea of the truest security in the universe is observed or observable security.

1286
01:12:32,050 --> 01:12:38,209
Rym: Like some, like someone's a good example of this would be there is someone who sits outside your, your house.

1287
01:12:39,551 --> 01:12:43,970
Rym: And if someone comes up, they watch that person to see if they put the key in and open the door.

1288
01:12:44,070 --> 01:12:46,950
Rym: So if someone tries to pick the lock, they can be like, nope, and shoo them away.

1289
01:12:47,550 --> 01:12:58,610
Rym: But at the same time, if someone who doesn't look like they should have the key to your house, because they have like the list of all the people you've authorized to go in the house, even if they have the right key, that person can investigate further.

1290
01:12:59,692 --> 01:13:00,770
Rym: There's still a weak link there.

1291
01:13:00,790 --> 01:13:01,850
Rym: You have to trust that person.

1292
01:13:01,990 --> 01:13:06,230
Rym: That's why a lot of like, look at the, look at the factors involved in launching a nuclear missile.

1293
01:13:07,171 --> 01:13:12,049
Rym: In the very end, two people have to do it together while being observed by other people.

1294
01:13:14,031 --> 01:13:19,970
Rym: Most of this is not relevant to you in your day to day life, but if you want to have a career in security, you've got to at least think about these things.

1295
01:13:20,510 --> 01:13:34,050
Rym: So I recommend you read this article because it talks in detail about how you exploit chips like this because the algorithms to generate these keys are like elliptical curve, digital signal algorithms that are actually pretty simple.

1296
01:13:34,773 --> 01:13:36,410
Rym: And the math is pretty straightforward.

1297
01:13:37,190 --> 01:13:39,769
Rym: Like it's an inch, like you can read about this stuff and understand it.

1298
01:13:40,877 --> 01:13:41,490
Rym: Pretty quickly.

1299
01:13:43,030 --> 01:13:43,331
Scott: Yeah, just so.

1300
01:13:43,371 --> 01:13:47,810
Scott: the final thing is that, you know, I harp on this a lot and that's why I'm going to bring it up yet again.

1301
01:13:47,890 --> 01:13:49,610
Rym: I mean, we talk about this topic a lot.

1302
01:13:49,910 --> 01:13:51,290
Scott: You see lots of news stories.

1303
01:13:51,690 --> 01:13:54,570
Scott: So and so's Instagram was hacked, right?

1304
01:13:54,711 --> 01:13:56,390
Scott: All that kind of nonsense, right?

1305
01:13:56,891 --> 01:13:58,650
Scott: How does that actually happen?

1306
01:13:59,411 --> 01:14:01,650
Scott: It happened 90 plus percent of the time.

1307
01:14:01,790 --> 01:14:04,530
Scott: No, there isn't some magical way to hack into Instagram.

1308
01:14:04,711 --> 01:14:09,630
Scott: Otherwise I would be taking over celebrity accounts constantly and posting all kinds of stuff, right?

1309
01:14:09,992 --> 01:14:11,230
Scott: That's not happening, right?

1310
01:14:11,650 --> 01:14:13,450
Scott: You can't just hack someone's Instagram account.

1311
01:14:13,550 --> 01:14:14,590
Scott: That would be a huge fiasco.

1312
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:17,550
Scott: And the same applies for Twitter accounts, Facebook accounts, everything, right?

1313
01:14:17,810 --> 01:14:19,610
Scott: There is no magical way.

1314
01:14:19,751 --> 01:14:21,001
Scott: Just hack into someone's account.

1315
01:14:21,022 --> 01:14:21,949
Scott: when someone's account is hacked.

1316
01:14:22,551 --> 01:14:27,830
Scott: It's because most likely they told someone their password, figured out their password.

1317
01:14:28,370 --> 01:14:34,530
Scott: Someone tried to do account recovery and like, guest their pet's name or something.

1318
01:14:35,432 --> 01:14:36,529
Rym: This is the side.

1319
01:14:36,930 --> 01:14:50,329
Rym: All those Twitter memes like, hey, all those Twitter memes that are like your hacker name is the street you grew up on, the first bacon model of a car you owned and your brother's middle name.

1320
01:14:50,552 --> 01:14:50,988
Rym: Like, guess what?

1321
01:14:51,330 --> 01:14:51,687
Rym: Guess what?

1322
01:14:51,791 --> 01:14:52,550
Rym: That's farming.

1323
01:14:54,530 --> 01:14:57,270
Rym: Those questions are all the same goddamn questions everywhere.

1324
01:14:57,590 --> 01:15:00,509
Scott: Someone getting phished, clicking on something they shouldn't have clicked on.

1325
01:15:00,730 --> 01:15:06,870
Rym: Sometimes spear phishing, like someone is personally targeted with a researched attack, usually a high value target.

1326
01:15:07,710 --> 01:15:08,349
Scott: Yep, exactly.

1327
01:15:08,790 --> 01:15:12,150
Scott: So no one's getting hacked.

1328
01:15:13,133 --> 01:15:18,169
Scott: There isn't something you can download where, like, you type in the name of an account you want to log into and it's like, tada.

1329
01:15:19,133 --> 01:15:20,210
Scott: There's one nuance to that.

1330
01:15:20,930 --> 01:15:30,250
Rym: People who are getting hacked, like a primary hack where they were hacked the way we're talking, usually that is like a state sponsored type of attack.

1331
01:15:30,633 --> 01:15:32,230
Rym: That is a different ball game.

1332
01:15:32,952 --> 01:15:38,348
Rym: Like the US government, if the CIA is after your ass, there's probably a lot of ways they can hack you.

1333
01:15:38,852 --> 01:15:41,030
Rym: But they're not breaking encryption.

1334
01:15:41,670 --> 01:15:43,290
Rym: They're doing operational attacks.

1335
01:15:43,470 --> 01:15:46,050
Rym: They're doing things like key loggers to get your password.

1336
01:15:46,531 --> 01:15:52,090
Scott: It's like the Twitter kid who got in trouble and he was making, he basically made friends with someone who's on the inside.

1337
01:15:52,230 --> 01:15:53,510
Scott: It was an inside job, right?

1338
01:15:53,830 --> 01:15:58,810
Rym: But I would argue most hacks are a combination of inside job and poor operational security.

1339
01:15:59,214 --> 01:15:59,901
Rym: Like 99% of all hacks.

1340
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:04,590
Scott: So I don't think we can never go down this topic again.

1341
01:16:04,710 --> 01:16:12,010
Scott: We've beaten down all the authentication related bushes until there is a new major development in this area.

1342
01:16:12,731 --> 01:16:15,870
Scott: We have done our final episode on it of many episodes.

1343
01:16:17,410 --> 01:16:24,568
Scott: You should do everything we just said and give us Monday show ideas so we don't have to retread ground like this.

1344
01:16:24,930 --> 01:16:25,002
Rym: Yep.

1345
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:27,050
Rym: Because otherwise, you know what's coming.

1346
01:16:27,730 --> 01:16:28,509
Rym: It's almost time.

1347
01:16:28,992 --> 01:16:30,710
Rym: For the, for the tech news roundup.

1348
01:16:31,071 --> 01:16:31,450
Rym: It's right there.

1349
01:16:31,690 --> 01:16:32,204
Rym: I can feel it.

1350
01:16:32,850 --> 01:16:33,409
Scott: I'm going to stop.

1351
01:16:33,854 --> 01:16:34,189
Rym: That's all.

1352
01:16:37,992 --> 01:16:40,110
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1353
01:16:40,330 --> 01:16:45,229
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1354
01:16:45,650 --> 01:16:50,650
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1355
01:16:51,010 --> 01:16:53,590
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1356
01:16:53,850 --> 01:16:58,350
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1357

Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1358
01:17:03,190 --> 01:17:06,190
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1359
01:17:06,390 --> 01:17:09,290
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1360
01:17:10,192 --> 01:17:17,750
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights are Alan Joyce, Hygma Nickle, Link Iggi, Dread Lily, Tenebrae, Chris Reimer, Clinton Walt, and Grant Finch.
