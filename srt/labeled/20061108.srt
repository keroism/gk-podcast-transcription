1
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,587
Rym: It's Wednesday, November 8th.

2
00:00:11,908 --> 00:00:14,977
Rym: I'm Rym and I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:15,017 --> 00:00:15,860
Rym: We review trigone.

4
00:00:17,402 --> 00:00:18,437
Rym: Let's do this.

5
00:00:20,776 --> 00:00:29,092
Scott: So before I even woke up this morning It was raining and when I left the house it was raining and all day during work It was raining.

6
00:00:29,754 --> 00:00:35,430
Scott: and when I got home still raining and now I'm not sure but it might still be raining.

7
00:00:35,852 --> 00:00:37,984
Rym: It in fact is for I just looked out the window.

8
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:51,130
Rym: Holy crap I. it took me over an hour and a half to drive home because many of the freeways going out of New York City Blooded and I drove through more than six inches of standing water on multiple occasions.

9
00:00:51,973 --> 00:00:55,388
Scott: Yeah, it took me an extra 15 minutes to a half hour to get home back.

10
00:00:55,448 --> 00:01:04,449
Rym: at one point I ran a red light on purpose because I was sitting at an intersection in about several inches of water and I don't know what was happening up the road.

11
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:15,666
Rym: But kind of suddenly this small deluge of water is slowly approaching me and It's a significant amount of water that was probably going to put part of my car underwater.

12
00:01:15,686 --> 00:01:16,750
Rym: That shouldn't have been underwater.

13
00:01:17,372 --> 00:01:21,849
Rym: Oh, so I just kind of gunned it and went into the intersection and kept went on my way.

14
00:01:22,454 --> 00:01:23,242
Scott: That was a good move.

15
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,415
Rym: Yeah Like the what.

16
00:01:25,435 --> 00:01:30,878
Rym: the level of water was rising very noticeably and quickly, you know It made it kind of worse.

17
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:35,497
Scott: but kind of better was the fact that Since it's not daylight savings time anymore.

18
00:01:35,597 --> 00:01:36,640
Scott: We set the clocks back.

19
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,146
Scott: It was dark like halfway through home.

20
00:01:39,487 --> 00:01:40,470
Rym: See, that's just terrible.

21
00:01:41,411 --> 00:01:45,606
Scott: Uh, I kind of like darkness, but it did make my drive getting home longer.

22
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:46,730
Rym: See, why do you like darkness?

23
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:53,150
Rym: I would love the Sun to be out at every moment that I'm awake during the day cuz it hurts my eyes.

24
00:01:53,652 --> 00:01:55,138
Rym: Okay, so you're just a wuss.

25
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,046
Scott: No cuz it hurts my eyes.

26
00:01:57,167 --> 00:01:58,133
Rym: So you're just a wuss You don't?

27
00:01:58,315 --> 00:01:59,530
Rym: you don't like it to be sunny outside.

28
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,907
Rym: You just want it to be eternal night like a vampire or fungus if it was warm out.

29
00:02:03,947 --> 00:02:06,052
Scott: Hell, yeah Yeah.

30
00:02:06,695 --> 00:02:06,795
Rym: Yeah.

31
00:02:06,815 --> 00:02:08,622
Rym: Well, you're the one who doesn't like to go on hikes or anything.

32
00:02:08,643 --> 00:02:09,646
Rym: So I guess I can say it.

33
00:02:10,068 --> 00:02:11,834
Scott: Whatever All right.

34
00:02:12,176 --> 00:02:14,490
Scott: What kind of news is going on besides weather?

35
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:19,727
Rym: Well, I figure since this will be the last time we'll have to talk about it for a long time a

36
00:02:20,249 --> 00:02:20,450
Scott: year

37
00:02:20,992 --> 00:02:31,450
Rym: I note in the news that the Democrats in America took control of the House of Representatives and it is 99% likely that they also took control of the Senate.

38
00:02:32,531 --> 00:02:32,832
Scott: You know what?

39
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:42,221
Scott: This proves to me that all that stuff about voting machines being rigged and mass conspiracies Was not quite as true as it seemed.

40
00:02:42,342 --> 00:02:44,250
Scott: that the voting machines are just crappy.

41
00:02:44,772 --> 00:02:49,230
Rym: Oh, yeah, the voting machines are just kind of dick and I think d-ball should be held accountable.

42
00:02:49,391 --> 00:02:53,425
Scott: Yeah, they're not cheating to you know, make one side or the other win.

43
00:02:53,586 --> 00:03:08,821
Rym: They're just bad though I have to admit I'm kind of 50/50 on how the results went even though the evil Sue Kelly has not only been booted from our congressional district, but the guy we didn't Back at all, but we voted for anyway.

44
00:03:09,543 --> 00:03:14,970
Rym: now that I've learned more about his history He's pretty awesome and I retroactively endorse John Hall.

45
00:03:15,372 --> 00:03:18,250
Scott: Yeah, I still don't know anything about John Hall.

46
00:03:19,015 --> 00:03:21,170
Scott: He was the alternative to the bitch Sue Kelly.

47
00:03:21,352 --> 00:03:27,205
Rym: See I read about his policies and I liked him But now I read about his history and who he was and he he's a pretty awesome, dude.

48
00:03:27,526 --> 00:03:28,670
Scott: Yeah, how awesome is he?

49
00:03:29,111 --> 00:03:30,015
Scott: He's fairly awesome.

50
00:03:30,055 --> 00:03:32,145
Rym: He did some writing for rock bands.

51
00:03:32,165 --> 00:03:33,310
Rym: He was in some rock bands.

52
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:34,072
Rym: He was wait.

53
00:03:34,133 --> 00:03:37,383
Scott: Wait, so we have a rock and roll guy as our house representative.

54
00:03:37,463 --> 00:03:37,624
Rym: Why?

55
00:03:37,664 --> 00:03:38,266
Rym: Yes, we do.

56
00:03:38,727 --> 00:03:39,570
Scott: That's kind of crazy.

57
00:03:40,251 --> 00:03:41,757
Scott: He doesn't look like a rock and roll guy.

58
00:03:41,797 --> 00:03:44,226
Scott: He looks like a bald tall jolly man.

59
00:03:44,286 --> 00:03:44,788
Rym: He's not bald.

60
00:03:44,828 --> 00:03:45,310
Rym: He's balding.

61
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:48,745
Scott: Okay, he is really smiley looks even if he's balding.

62
00:03:48,765 --> 00:03:53,505
Rym: He totally shaves his head He's tall and he has a really really big hand.

63
00:03:53,886 --> 00:03:54,268
Scott: Yeah.

64
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:58,887
Scott: Yeah He looks like like he was crouching down way like he must have been kneeling.

65
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,569
Scott: in one of these pictures I saw where he's with a bunch of old people.

66
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:28,429
Rym: But like I said, I'm kind of 50/50 on how the elections went because on one hand I wanted America to kind of reject this whole neoconservative thing, but at the same time The neoconservatives have gotten America into quite a bit of a quagmire over there in the great sovereign nation of Iraq You know occupying it at all and I have to say Part of me really kind of wanted them to stay in power so that they'd have to deal with this mess.

67
00:04:29,971 --> 00:04:41,475
Scott: Well, I think what's gonna happen is if the Democrats don't fix it pretty quick relatively quickly, you know and say I don't know four to six years Then we're gonna see people go.

68
00:04:41,516 --> 00:04:45,890
Scott: Hey, you didn't fix it and they'll go right back to the you know, the Republicans again.

69
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:51,730
Rym: Yeah, or maybe maybe they'll go toward I don't know a different political party.

70
00:04:51,831 --> 00:04:56,953
Rym: my hope my dark horse is that Howard Dean and Al Gore

71
00:04:57,616 --> 00:04:58,158
Scott: and all those

72
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:17,710
Rym: cool Democrats not the generic milquetoast Democrats but the ones who actually are doing some kind of vocal and crazy things will band together and break away from the Democratic Party or form some sort of Internal democratic schism where you'll have people who lean not necessarily to the left But definitely not to the right.

73
00:05:19,211 --> 00:05:22,139
Scott: Yeah, you keep dreaming about your crazy whatnot.

74
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:27,573
Rym: What I just want fiscally conservative socially liberal Intellin on.

75
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:32,330
Scott: yeah, I want fiscally conservative socially liberal socially liberal non libertarians.

76
00:05:32,691 --> 00:05:35,621
Rym: Yeah, that's tricky except pretty much positions.

77
00:05:35,681 --> 00:05:37,608
Rym: I want libertarians in every judicial position.

78
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:42,345
Scott: There is Supreme Court full libertarians, that'd be kind of crazy heavy amazing.

79
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:43,590
Scott: He's stupid crazy.

80
00:05:44,153 --> 00:05:47,510
Scott: Yeah, they'd be letting everyone off the hook like almost everyone.

81
00:05:48,013 --> 00:05:49,684
Rym: I think a lot of people should be a lot off the hook.

82
00:05:50,066 --> 00:05:51,815
Scott: I do too But not that many people.

83
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:56,056
Rym: which is gonna come up because I was called up today for jury, dude You know what that would do.

84
00:05:56,076 --> 00:06:01,462
Scott: that would make lawyers so pissed because they Prosecutors at least because they would never get anyone in jail.

85
00:06:01,542 --> 00:06:04,836
Scott: libertarian judge would just be like, whatever Let him go.

86
00:06:05,278 --> 00:06:06,705
Rym: Not really because the libertarians.

87
00:06:06,725 --> 00:06:07,690
Scott: Well, there are juries.

88
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:12,890
Rym: So yeah, but libertarians are also for a lot of laws at least many of them some of them.

89
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:14,578
Rym: But yeah, I was called up for jury duty.

90
00:06:15,181 --> 00:06:16,930
Scott: All right, you just got a jury due letter today.

91
00:06:17,352 --> 00:06:27,102
Rym: I'll bet money to our listeners out there though Depending on where you live it may or may not be legal for you to actually bet money But that I will not be allowed to serve on any jury.

92
00:06:27,122 --> 00:06:27,142
Rym: G.

93
00:06:27,864 --> 00:06:29,228
Scott: I wonder why huh?

94
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:34,986
Scott: Could it have something to do with you going in and saying I know about jury nullification.

95
00:06:35,046 --> 00:06:36,914
Scott: Don't let me be here anymore I want to go home.

96
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:39,410
Rym: I think it'll even if I didn't do that.

97
00:06:39,811 --> 00:06:50,423
Rym: I have a feeling that in any sort of examination to determine juries in some sort of jury selection process Would involve asking me questions out of which my mouth would come.

98
00:06:50,804 --> 00:07:03,328
Rym: I wanted to use a weird sentence like that answers that bordered on sarcastic possibly sardonic maybe a little bit snippy a Big ol can of salty sardines.

99
00:07:04,554 --> 00:07:09,090
Rym: I can't imagine many questions that they could ask me in jury selection.

100
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:12,325
Rym: That would not get an answer that nobody in the room wanted to hear.

101
00:07:12,707 --> 00:07:13,250
Scott: What's your name?

102
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:15,048
Scott: Where do you live?

103
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,290
Scott: What kind of car do you drive?

104
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,890
Scott: You see the first take you to get here.

105
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:23,885
Rym: The first question involves a lot of stories until they make me shut up.

106
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:29,310
Rym: The second question is Complicated because I still have a lot of ties to Michigan.

107
00:07:30,373 --> 00:07:36,370
Scott: whatever That's you and your loose interpretations of simple questions, well plus they wouldn't ask me stuff like that.

108
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,436
Rym: They already asked all that.

109
00:07:37,717 --> 00:07:39,849
Scott: I know I know I'm just giving examples.

110
00:07:40,131 --> 00:07:42,780
Rym: It's asked me things like how do you feel about blah?

111
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:45,310
Rym: and I'll tell him exactly how I feel about blah.

112
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,159
Rym: All right in excruciating detail.

113
00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:51,790
Scott: Okay, so let's get back to the eakiness instead of the politickness.

114
00:07:52,111 --> 00:07:57,289
Rym: Yeah, we're done with politics unless something interesting happens in the next while probably not gonna.

115
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:04,418
Rym: well The thing is we already know that Rumsfeld stepped down and Just don't feel like talking about it.

116
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,086
Scott: So it's not much to say now.

117
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:17,719
Scott: anyway Best Buy the store that I don't like that much, but I don't hate as much as Walmart is selling Imported Nintendo DS games.

118
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,548
Rym: hot damn Best Buy plus plus.

119
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,838
Scott: Yep If you go to Best Buy, there's a good chance.

120
00:08:22,898 --> 00:08:25,546
Scott: You will be able to buy jump superstars.

121
00:08:26,228 --> 00:08:30,798
Scott: and or What's the Naruto game called Naruto?

122
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:31,460
Scott: something?

123
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,563
Scott: something for?

124
00:08:32,943 --> 00:08:35,230
Rym: you could have just said the Naruto game?

125
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:43,498
Scott: No, because there's a whole bunch of Naruto games and only selling one specific whatever Naruto Saikyo ninja die kiss you.

126
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,301
Rym: is it a?

127
00:08:44,542 --> 00:08:45,786
Rym: is it a fighting game?

128
00:08:45,806 --> 00:08:47,010
Scott: I have no clue.

129
00:08:47,716 --> 00:08:49,008
Rym: I'll bet it's a fighting game.

130
00:08:49,631 --> 00:08:51,517
Scott: It very well could be see.

131
00:08:51,638 --> 00:08:56,618
Rym: I remember when I went to a lot of anime cons earlier in the year that Everyone had DS's.

132
00:08:56,658 --> 00:09:02,809
Rym: I mean everyone had DS's but Almost all of those people were playing these imported games.

133
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:03,837
Scott: Yep.

134
00:09:04,442 --> 00:09:05,450
Scott: I just wanted to continue.

135
00:09:05,931 --> 00:09:06,413
Scott: You know what?

136
00:09:06,433 --> 00:09:18,264
Scott: I was talking about yesterday with earthbound and how the stupid companies don't bring games over here, but yet Best Buy just about the most mainstream video game selling place you can get.

137
00:09:18,464 --> 00:09:30,550
Scott: next, you know after Walmart is Importing games and selling them for 50 bucks Not 40 or 30 like normal DS game sell for but 50 and people are probably buying them.

138
00:09:31,092 --> 00:09:32,678
Scott: A lot of people are probably buying them.

139
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,970
Rym: Well, it's like when Walden books started selling raw Japanese manga.

140
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:36,112
Rym: Yeah

141
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:54,048
Scott: So the question is now it's even dumber for them not to bring something over like earthbound the mother 3 You know call it earthbound DS or whatever because not only would it sell but you could sell it for 50 bucks Because all the people who really want it really want it and everyone else doesn't even know about it.

142
00:09:54,128 --> 00:09:58,847
Rym: Yeah You know, I mean you really don't even have to localize these games and they'll still sell.

143
00:09:58,867 --> 00:10:02,241
Scott: well earthbound You need to localize but jump superstars.

144
00:10:02,461 --> 00:10:03,586
Scott: You don't need to localize that.

145
00:10:03,606 --> 00:10:04,570
Scott: there's barely any text.

146
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,293
Scott: You can't look.

147
00:10:05,374 --> 00:10:08,690
Scott: all you need to localize is the instruction books and people know how to freakin play.

148
00:10:09,012 --> 00:10:11,029
Rym: No one even looks at instruction books anymore.

149
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:16,667
Scott: Yeah, apparently there's a sticker on these games in the store that says these are imported games.

150
00:10:16,968 --> 00:10:19,296
Scott: Don't worry They work with your American DS.

151
00:10:19,758 --> 00:10:23,070
Scott: go to import facts calm to get information, huh?

152
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:26,766
Scott: So I went to import facts calm and is a really crap.

153
00:10:26,887 --> 00:10:28,493
Scott: Lee made Standard.

154
00:10:28,814 --> 00:10:35,369
Scott: it looks like a cookie cutter website that has a picture of a DS and a picture of a PSP Which makes me think huh?

155
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,737
Scott: Maybe they're gonna import some PSP games.

156
00:10:37,918 --> 00:10:41,590
Rym: what PSP games are coming out in Japan that aren't coming out here that people care about?

157
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:45,034
Scott: I have no idea because if I click on the PSP It just is coming soon.

158
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:53,870
Scott: And if I click on the DS it says Naruto for jump superstars So whatever and there's barely any information about the games there.

159
00:10:53,870 --> 00:11:01,050
Scott: There's like a short blurb that describes the game in only, you know, the most back-of-the-book kind of way.

160
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:06,670
Rym: Yeah, that's fine because anyone who's gonna buy something like that is already knowing everything they need to know about it.

161
00:11:06,911 --> 00:11:10,410
Scott: Yeah, and there's a little form you can fill out to ask questions about the game.

162
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:22,810
Scott: But I think they're actually putting this out there in the holiday season is a really good idea because you know A lot of parents go to this like I've seen parents with or without their kids shopping for video games at the store.

163
00:11:23,332 --> 00:11:25,684
Scott: And you know, they don't read video game magazines.

164
00:11:25,704 --> 00:11:27,010
Scott: They don't know what games came out.

165
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,669
Scott: They just look at the covers in the backs of the games and pick one out.

166
00:11:30,031 --> 00:11:35,970
Rym: I have often explained to parents at video game stores what the difference was between a Gameboy and a Diaz.

167
00:11:36,111 --> 00:11:47,633
Scott: Yeah, so when they see jump superstars and Naruto Whatever for all they do is they look at the package and they'll see the characters that their kid likes on the package and they'll Pick that up.

168
00:11:48,297 --> 00:12:04,200
Scott: So and there aren't too many Naruto Dragonball jump superstar type games out in the US to you know, also have those characters on them things of the day.

169
00:12:04,802 --> 00:12:07,632
Rym: This is some scary shit that I got right here for you.

170
00:12:07,753 --> 00:12:09,439
Rym: So we were talking a while ago about it.

171
00:12:10,783 --> 00:12:13,339
Rym: Nothing scares people anymore, at least nothing scares us.

172
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:17,740
Rym: No media is genuinely frightening anymore the closest thing being HP Lovecraft.

173
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:23,680
Scott: But I guess if he showed me a real live surgery of someone that's not all their guts cut open.

174
00:12:24,062 --> 00:12:26,093
Scott: It's not scary, but it makes me all queasy.

175
00:12:26,234 --> 00:12:26,576
Scott: Really?

176
00:12:26,757 --> 00:12:27,782
Scott: Yep That's like.

177
00:12:27,822 --> 00:12:36,880
Scott: the only thing that get like gets me in any way like if you start describing Surgeries or talking about deadly illnesses in detail like I'll get all queasy.

178
00:12:37,741 --> 00:12:39,779
Scott: Really yeah, that's the only way to get me.

179
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:40,061
Scott: You know.

180
00:12:40,081 --> 00:12:46,528
Rym: that explains it because every now and then when I've brought up diseases or things randomly in conversations I never really put two and two together.

181
00:12:46,548 --> 00:12:56,540
Rym: Yeah, I've told you this before Yeah, but I never realized that when I was describing diseases that you were thinking about that sort of thing I always figured it like I'd have to show you a guy's beating heart on YouTube.

182
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,167
Scott: No, it's like I always like.

183
00:12:58,248 --> 00:13:00,518
Scott: imagine myself getting cut open or something.

184
00:13:00,538 --> 00:13:02,102
Scott: I'm like, ooh Like.

185
00:13:02,142 --> 00:13:05,698
Scott: I watched that video with the guy's bicep exploding which is not my thing of the day.

186
00:13:05,858 --> 00:13:10,450
Rym: good but Man, I was like, oh no, I had to close it.

187
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:13,260
Rym: I've seen a far more horrible video.

188
00:13:13,441 --> 00:13:16,480
Rym: I'm sure there's plenty of a weightlifter who had something else explode.

189
00:13:17,802 --> 00:13:18,504
Rym: I were that guy.

190
00:13:18,585 --> 00:13:21,955
Scott: actually it's weird because like something like that won't really bother me.

191
00:13:21,995 --> 00:13:23,400
Scott: It's only when it gets medical.

192
00:13:23,782 --> 00:13:27,800
Rym: It's like is this go it was medical because then they were trying to figure out how to help this guy.

193
00:13:27,921 --> 00:13:29,720
Scott: See that's when I would have gotten all queasy.

194
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,754
Scott: But yeah, it's like if someone's get like gets their head blown off with like a rocket.

195
00:13:34,155 --> 00:13:36,262
Scott: I'm cool for some reason I don't know why.

196
00:13:36,624 --> 00:13:41,860
Scott: but then if like a doctor tries to reattach like the body part they got blown off then I'm all like.

197
00:13:43,142 --> 00:13:43,744
Rym: So you want to know.

198
00:13:43,784 --> 00:13:46,632
Scott: it's really interesting even though it should be the opposite.

199
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:57,466
Rym: seeing something bad happen a video or anything Never bothers me like it'll bother me in a logical way like that's horrible, but I don't feel Disgusted or like.

200
00:13:57,526 --> 00:14:00,860
Rym: I don't feel any sort of visceral effect and I don't cry or anything.

201
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,939
Rym: But if I see other people reacting to something that sets me off.

202
00:14:06,381 --> 00:14:10,240
Rym: So if something tragic happens and I see it, I just think oh that was tragic.

203
00:14:10,602 --> 00:14:13,278
Rym: But if I see other people reacting to it, I'll get choked up.

204
00:14:14,581 --> 00:14:19,319
Rym: It's really kind of strange and I was thinking about this actually yesterday and while I was driving home.

205
00:14:20,001 --> 00:14:28,600
Scott: The other thing is if I see a video of like someone getting their guts ripped open by say a bear I'll be I'll be all good.

206
00:14:28,961 --> 00:14:36,127
Scott: But if I see someone in person like I'm standing right there and I see a guy get mauled by a bear Then I'll probably be all vomiting.

207
00:14:36,267 --> 00:14:37,854
Rym: You can't be a pair.

208
00:14:37,934 --> 00:14:39,340
Scott: All right, what are the things of the day?

209
00:14:39,686 --> 00:14:39,959
Scott: All right.

210
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,625
Rym: So this video.

211
00:14:41,645 --> 00:14:47,682
Rym: I'm not even going to bother telling you how I found this and I don't know if any of you have seen It or not.

212
00:14:47,722 --> 00:14:49,408
Rym: I haven't seen it around the internet.

213
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,760
Rym: I might dig it or something just so other people can see this business.

214
00:14:53,741 --> 00:15:00,405
Rym: It's a video done in the 60s to teach people how to ride a bicycle safety Safely.

215
00:15:00,787 --> 00:15:02,600
Rym: now that might not seem so scary.

216
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,051
Rym: You might expect it to be one of those 60s.

217
00:15:05,461 --> 00:15:15,927
Rym: If you turn left without signaling you'll die and then you know gory scenes of teenagers being killed Because that was the style of the times with the onions and everything And not even the belt.

218
00:15:16,128 --> 00:15:17,799
Scott: Yes, it's a style of the time, I understand.

219
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,408
Rym: It is one of those videos.

220
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:25,120
Rym: In 1957 or 58 Except the intention or the intent if I may.

221
00:15:29,222 --> 00:15:35,540
Rym: This video is one of those except now I'm just gonna describe it and then I'll keep giving you more details.

222
00:15:36,142 --> 00:15:40,999
Rym: Everyone is dressed up as a monkey, but what's the title of the video?

223
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,819
Rym: One got that.

224
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:47,560
Scott: What does that have to do with bike safety?

225
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,039
Rym: I'll get to that because I wondered that too until I watched the whole video.

226
00:15:52,802 --> 00:16:01,209
Rym: It was it was kind of a almost a Hitchcock twist ending except it was a lame Non Hitchcock at all twist ending.

227
00:16:01,349 --> 00:16:02,252
Scott: so it was corny.

228
00:16:02,512 --> 00:16:03,215
Rym: It was one of those.

229
00:16:03,235 --> 00:16:04,779
Rym: I see what you did there.

230
00:16:06,601 --> 00:16:10,114
Rym: So it's one of those videos, but everyone's dressed up like a monkey.

231
00:16:10,134 --> 00:16:22,180
Rym: when I say dressed up like a monkey I mean, there are normal people who have these basically steel Windy tails looks like bent up rebar sticking out of their butts.

232
00:16:23,201 --> 00:16:24,507
Scott: How did they attach it to their butts?

233
00:16:24,527 --> 00:16:25,853
Rym: like stuck to the back of their pants?

234
00:16:26,054 --> 00:16:27,400
Scott: Okay, so then you shove it up their butt.

235
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,286
Rym: Um, it's not that kind of video.

236
00:16:29,366 --> 00:16:30,309
Scott: It could be it's the 60s.

237
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,456
Scott: It's the style of the time you understand.

238
00:16:32,997 --> 00:16:35,434
Rym: No, it wasn't All right.

239
00:16:36,221 --> 00:16:42,959
Rym: So the only other costume element they have other than these tails because they're otherwise normal people is that they have monkey masks.

240
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:45,552
Rym: on Grotesque monkey masks.

241
00:16:46,034 --> 00:16:50,604
Rym: they live rotting scary Skeletal monkey mask.

242
00:16:50,865 --> 00:16:52,730
Rym: these things are scary.

243
00:16:52,951 --> 00:16:56,220
Rym: you show this video to a six-year-old and he will cry himself to sleep that night.

244
00:16:56,681 --> 00:17:05,005
Scott: Yeah, this is before the times when they invented modern mask making technologies, you know things like rubber and latex and all that I mean, they're.

245
00:17:05,165 --> 00:17:12,242
Rym: they're kind of like melded with the people's faces But they're all wrinkly all over and scary looking and they're really big So lace.

246
00:17:12,301 --> 00:17:20,079
Rym: their mouths like stick way out and they're grinning like the Joker and in addition their eyes Are really really sunk because it's just the actors eyes in the back.

247
00:17:20,421 --> 00:17:20,964
Rym: so it's like they're.

248
00:17:21,023 --> 00:17:29,295
Rym: they're like zombies skeleton monkeys and Their facial expressions don't change and they're moving this kind of pantomime way.

249
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:32,004
Rym: This is some scary shit It sure is.

250
00:17:32,064 --> 00:17:39,420
Rym: and then one by one all of them die in horrible ways Riding their bicycles, of course because it's a bike safety video.

251
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:39,681
Scott: Yeah,

252
00:17:39,721 --> 00:17:54,539
Rym: like one doesn't signal and then he gets hit by a car and then one doesn't see a stop sign and she gets hit By a bigger car one rides on like the wrong side of the road gets run over by a steamroller Yeah, and it just keeps getting worse and worse and worse.

253
00:17:54,579 --> 00:18:07,020
Rym: now The plot is that they all have their lunch all of them have a little lunch bag with the name on it and every time one like they're all Riding along and one guy has all the lunches in his bike because he's the fat kid.

254
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,780
Rym: I guess or he's gonna be the fat kid because he's got all these lunches Mm-hmm, and they're all right.

255
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:19,050
Rym: And every time one dies it cuts to the lunch bag with the name and it says something like little Billy should have paid attention.

256
00:18:20,161 --> 00:18:24,239
Rym: I'll bet he wishes he had but he doesn't have a second, you know the stuff like that.

257
00:18:25,042 --> 00:18:30,380
Rym: And it finally gets to the end and all the monkeys are dead except for the one who had all the lunches.

258
00:18:30,501 --> 00:18:31,479
Scott: Well the one who is a human.

259
00:18:32,106 --> 00:18:33,399
Rym: Well, you see that's the twist.

260
00:18:34,002 --> 00:18:36,952
Rym: You get to the end and they don't show you the last one's face.

261
00:18:37,052 --> 00:18:42,630
Rym: all the shots are from the back and you know Now he's got everyone's lunches because all the other monkeys died.

262
00:18:42,891 --> 00:18:48,753
Rym: and then he find out he's actually human because he was smart enough to follow All the bike safety rules and as a result, he didn't die.

263
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:55,140
Rym: a horrible death though He doesn't seem terribly put off by the fact that all of his skeleton zombie monkey friends are dead again.

264
00:18:55,381 --> 00:18:56,668
Scott: Well, apparently they were all idiots.

265
00:18:56,688 --> 00:18:58,075
Scott: So he was kind of glad they died now.

266
00:18:58,115 --> 00:18:58,940
Scott: He's got all their lunches.

267
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:00,450
Rym: You don't have to watch the whole thing.

268
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:05,291
Rym: Just look at these Disturbing costumes got damn.

269
00:19:05,391 --> 00:19:09,497
Scott: Yeah, that's the reason we described the whole thing Is so you just look at the costumes and move on.

270
00:19:09,658 --> 00:19:12,690
Scott: god If you watch the whole thing, you'll be frightened beyond belief.

271
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:13,995
Rym: These things are really creepy.

272
00:19:14,056 --> 00:19:15,220
Rym: I can't stress that enough.

273
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:16,484
Scott: Yeah, okay.

274
00:19:16,564 --> 00:19:20,256
Scott: So my thing of the day is totally unrelated in every possible way.

275
00:19:20,697 --> 00:19:33,119
Scott: There's a dude in Germany he is known as the train rider or the train surfer and what he did is He would jump on the back of a bullet train.

276
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:34,303
Scott: now You got to understand.

277
00:19:34,323 --> 00:19:39,700
Scott: a bullet train goes about 200 miles an hour if at you know when it's going.

278
00:19:40,142 --> 00:19:40,726
Scott: So I think that's.

279
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:47,634
Scott: I don't know if that's a top speed or the average speed But it goes really fast faster than any roller coaster you're ever gonna go on.

280
00:19:48,357 --> 00:19:58,774
Scott: and he had this wicked Powerful suction cup like super powerful with a handle on it and he would attach it to the rear window of the train Right before the train started going

281
00:19:59,015 --> 00:20:01,788
Rym: like just before it goes he kind of runs up goes hop up up shoot

282
00:20:02,189 --> 00:20:13,139
Scott: and he suction cups to the back window of the train and he has a rope tied to him and tied to the handle and he rides the back of the train as it goes and It's super crazy.

283
00:20:13,865 --> 00:20:23,859
Scott: Now the twist, I don't know It's not a good twist really and the reason the dude was doing these daring stunts is because he had leukemia And he was gonna die.

284
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:30,900
Scott: So he spent the last year of his life doing crazy shit riding the backs of trains at crazy high speed.

285
00:20:31,321 --> 00:20:34,149
Rym: Now aside from the fact that this video is absolutely amazing.

286
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:38,140
Rym: I can't imagine the thrill of what that man was doing.

287
00:20:38,341 --> 00:20:42,402
Scott: Yeah, it's like the only thing master that man that kid was younger than us He was.

288
00:20:42,462 --> 00:20:45,173
Scott: he was born three years after us and he died last year.

289
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:46,196
Rym: Well this year.

290
00:20:46,217 --> 00:20:49,226
Scott: Yeah, right It'll soon be last year.

291
00:20:49,246 --> 00:20:50,793
Rym: You know, we have some time.

292
00:20:50,994 --> 00:20:58,500
Rym: Yeah, either way I gotta say this guy really embodies almost everything I live for because he knew he was going to die.

293
00:20:58,783 --> 00:21:00,259
Rym: He his life was over.

294
00:21:00,521 --> 00:21:01,704
Rym: There's nothing that could be done.

295
00:21:02,286 --> 00:21:15,220
Rym: and instead of moping about it or whining about it or wasting his last days He decided to live as awesome of a life as he could for as long as he could doing as many Dangerous and amazing things that yeah, cuz he didn't care.

296
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,104
Rym: He had nothing to lose.

297
00:21:16,365 --> 00:21:20,040
Rym: so he figured he might as well just go all out and go all out.

298
00:21:20,141 --> 00:21:21,519
Scott: He did just like Captain Jack.

299
00:21:21,922 --> 00:21:26,000
Rym: I have a lot of respect for this guy and for yeah, this guy's about the same as Captain Jack.

300
00:21:26,181 --> 00:21:34,540
Scott: He's you know in the same page in my book You know guy who was living a crazy lifestyle and died living the crazy lifestyle of awesome

301
00:21:35,081 --> 00:21:35,362
Rym: Yeah,

302
00:21:35,823 --> 00:21:45,166
Scott: but yeah, there's not much you can do on earth to go that fast and drive an f1 car Drive some other crazy car

303
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:47,374
Rym: jump out of an airplane without a parachute.

304
00:21:47,755 --> 00:21:48,337
Scott: We go 200 miles an hour.

305
00:21:49,321 --> 00:21:49,864
Rym: I think so.

306
00:21:49,965 --> 00:21:52,500
Rym: If you're wearing the right kind of clothes, what's the terminal velocity?

307
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:55,713
Rym: I don't know and I don't feel like looking it up me either.

308
00:21:55,833 --> 00:22:05,566
Scott: Maybe one of our listeners will yeah There's not much you can do to get that thrill, especially not for so low a price as buying a suction cup Yeah, and some rope.

309
00:22:05,586 --> 00:22:06,972
Rym: yet some rope some rope.

310
00:22:07,052 --> 00:22:08,820
Rym: He also had a little mask on his face.

311
00:22:09,442 --> 00:22:14,400
Scott: Oh, we had a. he had like a bandana to keep his face from getting burned up or hit by bugs and shit.

312
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,573
Rym: I guess probably, you know worried about wind shear and all that.

313
00:22:17,593 --> 00:22:18,317
Scott: Yeah that too.

314
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:19,040
Scott: He had a little hoodie.

315
00:22:19,642 --> 00:22:21,832
Rym: But really this video is absolutely amazing.

316
00:22:22,134 --> 00:22:26,397
Scott: Yeah way to go guy Rest in peace, I guess.

317
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:41,960
Rym: So tonight kind of out of the blue we have decided to review an old classic probably an old classic from the 90s An old classic from our days at RIT one of the in my opinion best anime ever made.

318
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:46,818
Rym: It's in my personal top five and I would put it in a semi objective top 10 or 20 easily.

319
00:22:47,842 --> 00:22:52,100
Rym: Yeah, probably it's a really freaking good show that has a lot going for it.

320
00:22:52,301 --> 00:22:58,992
Scott: It's definitely it's not as good as you know, the greats But it's definitely better than all the average shows.

321
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:11,460
Rym: putting it up there on the the awesome list I mean really in terms of maybe not best but definitely my favorite not favorite in the sense of you know My favorite shows that speak to me like utenna and captain Tyler and all that.

322
00:23:11,842 --> 00:23:17,948
Rym: But my you know top five list would definitely be in no particular order Cowboy bebop eska flown a Evangelion.

323
00:23:18,008 --> 00:23:18,630
Rym: try gun.

324
00:23:18,951 --> 00:23:22,500
Rym: and usually the fifth spot is whatever show I liked most recently.

325
00:23:22,921 --> 00:23:24,727
Scott: Yeah, so try gun.

326
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:27,254
Scott: Let's see what we got a lot of stuff to say about.

327
00:23:27,294 --> 00:23:27,695
Scott: try gun.

328
00:23:27,735 --> 00:23:29,180
Scott: Yeah, we've seen the whole show.

329
00:23:29,642 --> 00:23:31,993
Scott: I've read a lot of the manga but not all of it.

330
00:23:32,013 --> 00:23:33,500
Rym: I've read enough of the mom.

331
00:23:33,762 --> 00:23:35,312
Scott: You don't need to read much of the manga.

332
00:23:35,332 --> 00:23:36,400
Scott: We'll talk about that later.

333
00:23:36,781 --> 00:23:40,694
Scott: I met the guy who invent who created try gun night.

334
00:23:40,734 --> 00:23:41,336
Scott: Oh, yeah.

335
00:23:41,376 --> 00:23:42,339
Scott: Yes the hero night.

336
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,925
Scott: Oh Yeah, lots of stuff.

337
00:23:45,267 --> 00:23:48,540
Rym: so we'll talk a bit about the origin of try gun and we'll just kind of go from there.

338
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:51,310
Rym: I mean, it was originally a manga by Naito.

339
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:51,892
Rym: Mm-hmm.

340
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,080
Scott: And okay, there's a trick with the manga.

341
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:59,460
Scott: It was originally a manga by Naito published in one magazine and then that magazine got cancelled.

342
00:23:59,561 --> 00:24:03,989
Scott: So then he restarted try gun in another magazine But he called it try gun maximum.

343
00:24:04,411 --> 00:24:10,120
Scott: and that's why if you try to buy the manga It's like two volumes that are like the gold and the silver volumes.

344
00:24:10,421 --> 00:24:11,685
Scott: That's the original deal.

345
00:24:12,046 --> 00:24:14,313
Scott: then this try gun maximum which comes after that.

346
00:24:14,754 --> 00:24:21,464
Rym: now, I'll say pretty much straight up Don't bother with the manga I'm really serious.

347
00:24:21,905 --> 00:24:25,555
Scott: Yeah, if you're really curious you can get the gold and the silver whatever.

348
00:24:25,635 --> 00:24:29,200
Scott: but don't bother with try gun Maximum unless you're crazy.

349
00:24:29,561 --> 00:24:42,780
Rym: I mean you'll learn a lot because there are elements of the show that we're kind of glossed over or Altered and by reading the manga or at least flipping through the manga You can fill in a lot of the details as to what was specifically actually going on.

350
00:24:43,501 --> 00:24:49,016
Rym: Yeah, but the manga itself much like the Sailor Moon manga is not incomprehensible.

351
00:24:49,056 --> 00:24:50,520
Rym: It's fucking incomprehensible.

352
00:24:50,924 --> 00:24:55,255
Scott: Oh, it is totally Impossible to understand what the hell is going on.

353
00:24:55,275 --> 00:25:06,655
Rym: in parts of the mug It's just there's panels and there's stuff in him and I can't for the life of me figure out what's actually going on And I would go ten pages at a time not even knowing who was in the scene.

354
00:25:06,695 --> 00:25:07,920
Rym: Let alone what was happening.

355
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:21,200
Scott: Yeah, you'll see like a fight scene right and the fight scene will be say three pages and each panel will have someone shooting Someone getting shot, you know someone hating someone with something but you can't tell where they are.

356
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:25,900
Scott: You can't tell who's fighting who who's on what side especially if it's more than a two-sided fight.

357
00:25:26,341 --> 00:25:28,768
Scott: You can't tell who just hit who with what.

358
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:30,312
Scott: it's totally crazy.

359
00:25:30,373 --> 00:25:39,324
Scott: And then when you basically had to skip over it I mean, it looks pretty cool, but the skip over it get to the end of the fight and then you're like, okay What just happened?

360
00:25:39,544 --> 00:25:42,091
Rym: Yeah, and then there's the one guy who was made of midgets.

361
00:25:42,532 --> 00:25:50,320
Scott: Yeah, it's it's really just out of control If you're if you like the anime and you really want to read the manga?

362
00:25:51,047 --> 00:25:52,360
Scott: No, don't read try gun maximum.

363
00:25:52,461 --> 00:25:55,520
Scott: Just get the gold and the silver if you're gonna get anything at all.

364
00:25:55,580 --> 00:26:02,966
Rym: Which get the manga if you're a try gun nut if you're the kind of person who would say try gun is my favorite anime Ever buy the manga.

365
00:26:03,086 --> 00:26:04,872
Rym: Otherwise, I I'm serious.

366
00:26:05,233 --> 00:26:07,160
Rym: It's probably okay to skip this.

367
00:26:07,383 --> 00:26:08,380
Rym: You're not missing much.

368
00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:14,340
Scott: Yeah I'm just saying the gold and the silver volumes are like 50% craziness and the maximum is the hundred percent craziness.

369
00:26:14,441 --> 00:26:15,689
Rym: It's maximum crazy.

370
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,180
Scott: That's why they change the name like that.

371
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,708
Rym: So when we talk I mean the story.

372
00:26:18,788 --> 00:26:27,679
Rym: the basic story is pretty much the same but we're gonna talk about it almost entirely from the perspective of the anime because that's What makes try gun shine to me?

373
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:34,740
Rym: Try gun was a mediocre manga that was somehow miraculously turned into a very amazing anime.

374
00:26:35,283 --> 00:26:41,440
Scott: Yeah, well because the characters and the Basic plot of the manga are really really good.

375
00:26:41,841 --> 00:26:52,809
Scott: the thing is the specific way things turn out in the manga and the order in which they any order and timing of which when things are revealed and when things happen isn't so good.

376
00:26:52,829 --> 00:26:58,423
Scott: and there's a lot of extra characters that are useless or silly or Just pointless.

377
00:26:58,804 --> 00:27:12,745
Rym: Yeah, the anime also goes to great lengths to kind of condense the plot make it sensical take out elements of the story that were usually kind of gratuitous or stupid and replace them with really meaningful or Elucidating stuff.

378
00:27:13,066 --> 00:27:14,351
Scott: Yeah, it's like in the manga.

379
00:27:14,371 --> 00:27:25,127
Scott: There'll be stuff that you just know all the time but then in the anime, they'll reveal this stuff to you like way near the end like So it's a totally different thing.

380
00:27:25,208 --> 00:27:29,479
Scott: Even though what's happening is the same you get a totally different effect now.

381
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:34,578
Rym: because of that I normally wouldn't really mention anyone other than the director when I talk about an anime.

382
00:27:34,598 --> 00:27:41,580
Rym: but Yosuke Kuroda who wrote the or at least he did the script for the Try Gun anime did a pretty phenomenal job.

383
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,267
Rym: I'd say yeah, he.

384
00:27:43,468 --> 00:27:46,220
Rym: I think he is one of the big points in making this shine.

385
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:52,460
Rym: If you look I'm not gonna list it, but he wrote scripts and did screenplays for a whole boatload of anime.

386
00:27:53,582 --> 00:27:55,208
Scott: Yeah, the director of Try Gun.

387
00:27:55,309 --> 00:27:57,518
Scott: It's kind of weird that this guy is done.

388
00:27:57,558 --> 00:28:00,720
Scott: Basically Nothing else of note whatsoever.

389
00:28:00,881 --> 00:28:02,646
Scott: He's just some useless.

390
00:28:02,706 --> 00:28:04,773
Scott: Well, he's not completely much Satoshi Nishimura.

391
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:06,699
Scott: Yeah, he's basically done nothing.

392
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:12,560
Scott: He's directed one other thing that no one cares about and he did storyboards and key animations there.

393
00:28:12,821 --> 00:28:16,140
Scott: But yeah, somehow he was the director of Try Gun and he did a good job.

394
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,608
Rym: But also I mean Naito who wrote Try Gun.

395
00:28:18,849 --> 00:28:22,280
Rym: the only other thing he's done is more Try Gun and Gun Grave.

396
00:28:22,822 --> 00:28:28,260
Scott: Yeah, the Yasuhiro Naito the only things he's done in his life are create the Try Gun manga.

397
00:28:29,022 --> 00:28:35,340
Scott: He helped design stuff for the gun grave video game and he helped design stuff for the gun grave anime.

398
00:28:35,541 --> 00:28:36,646
Scott: That's all he's ever done.

399
00:28:36,706 --> 00:28:38,434
Rym: Well, he went to Otakon and shook your hand.

400
00:28:38,474 --> 00:28:39,860
Scott: Yeah, I met him at Otakon.

401
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,993
Scott: He's a quiet Japanese dude who doesn't know English.

402
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:50,800
Rym: now Try Gun is also One of those kind of deceptive shows if you start watching it because at least a lot of people have different tests.

403
00:28:50,840 --> 00:29:03,820
Rym: but back in the day when we were at RIT the test of any show was four episodes or the first DVD whichever was longer and The first four episodes of Try Gun are very different from the rest of the show.

404
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:21,260
Rym: the show starts out very loud-hearted and gets progressively darker and darker and darker and darker and it just doesn't stop getting darker and it gets really preachy and serious but in a good way and There's a lot to it that if you just saw the first few episodes you have no idea what to expect.

405
00:29:21,903 --> 00:29:25,620
Scott: Yeah, the basic premise of Try Gun is that there's this guy.

406
00:29:26,001 --> 00:29:28,991
Scott: Well, there's these two insurance agents and they are.

407
00:29:29,211 --> 00:29:32,645
Scott: there's one girl Millie and the other one is yeah It doesn't matter.

408
00:29:32,726 --> 00:29:33,391
Scott: I forget their name.

409
00:29:33,451 --> 00:29:34,035
Scott: We'll talk about.

410
00:29:34,056 --> 00:29:34,620
Scott: it's been a while.

411
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:41,224
Rym: We'll talk about a lot of these things when we do the Try Gun spoilers episode because I have a lot to say about Try Gun that I can't tonight.

412
00:29:41,364 --> 00:29:42,669
Scott: Yeah, I'm only doing the basics.

413
00:29:42,729 --> 00:29:48,730
Scott: and at the setup here is you have these two insurance agents And there's an outlaw named Vash the stampede.

414
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,876
Scott: anyone who says Vash come over to my house.

415
00:29:50,917 --> 00:29:51,980
Scott: I'll kick you in the nuts.

416
00:29:52,742 --> 00:29:53,646
Rym: Now he's also.

417
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:57,319
Rym: he has many nicknames including the humanoid typhoon.

418
00:29:57,339 --> 00:30:04,371
Scott: Yep Now no one knows who this guy is But supposedly he like destroys cities and he freaking.

419
00:30:04,853 --> 00:30:07,400
Scott: he's just a crazy most dangerous man alive.

420
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,282
Scott: No one can take him.

421
00:30:08,503 --> 00:30:14,580
Rym: the insurance agents are looking for him because they work for an insurance company that's taking a bath on his damage.

422
00:30:15,181 --> 00:30:30,213
Scott: Yeah, so what they want to do is supposedly these are two badass insurance agents sort of like master Keaton of the olden days and they are going to find him and Prevent him from causing more damage to keep the insurance company in business

423
00:30:30,554 --> 00:30:32,730
Rym: or at least document the damages He causes.

424
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:39,833
Scott: yep That way if anyone tries to make a claim Saying it was Vash the stampede when it wasn't the insurance company won't have to pay out.

425
00:30:40,254 --> 00:30:42,722
Rym: now Vash the stampede You don't.

426
00:30:42,742 --> 00:30:49,525
Rym: I mean you can guess who he is in the show and everyone knows who he is because Vash is a very Iconic anime character.

427
00:30:49,585 --> 00:30:54,040
Rym: these days you see at least 10 or 15 Vash cosplayers than any major anime.

428
00:30:54,281 --> 00:31:10,249
Scott: It's one of those obvious secrets where in the first episode There's a crazy guy wearing a bit a long red trench coat and he has this yellow spiky hair and he's obviously really important, but he acts like a total doofus and he doesn't say who he is.

429
00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:14,784
Scott: and You totally being a viewer, you know, he's Vash the stampede.

430
00:31:14,905 --> 00:31:26,364
Scott: You just know that's not a spoiler You fucking know unless you're an idiot, but they never tell you for sure Only ever 99% sure until like the fifth or sixth episode.

431
00:31:26,465 --> 00:31:28,390
Rym: Yeah, I mean seriously for the first few episodes.

432
00:31:28,892 --> 00:31:34,570
Rym: It really is kind of a plot thing of is he really Vash the stampede or is he just pretending to be Vash the stampede?

433
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:41,650
Rym: There is a lot of evidence until you see more that yeah He's just some guy pretending to get free money and free doughnuts and stuff.

434
00:31:42,146 --> 00:31:47,271
Scott: Yeah This is sort of why you want to watch the anime and ignore the manga because if you see the manga the manga doesn't do That.

435
00:31:47,513 --> 00:31:48,196
Scott: the manga is like.

436
00:31:48,217 --> 00:31:49,403
Scott: here is Vash the stampede.

437
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:53,822
Scott: It's sort of boring But the anime does something like that holding information from you.

438
00:31:54,223 --> 00:31:55,990
Rym: So yeah, the insurance agents find this guy.

439
00:31:56,271 --> 00:31:58,743
Rym: They're not sure if he's Vash or not at all.

440
00:31:59,025 --> 00:32:00,050
Scott: So they have no idea.

441
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:04,668
Rym: They follow him around because they have nowhere else to go and this is the best lead they've got.

442
00:32:04,768 --> 00:32:08,018
Rym: and maybe This'll draw Vash out and they have hilarious adventures.

443
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:08,801
Scott: Yeah.

444
00:32:09,081 --> 00:32:11,990
Scott: Yeah, it's basically it's monster of the week for a little while.

445
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:13,255
Scott: You know go someplace new.

446
00:32:13,275 --> 00:32:14,620
Scott: There's a bad guy.

447
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,347
Scott: They get out of a tough situation.

448
00:32:16,408 --> 00:32:17,010
Scott: go someplace new.

449
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:18,830
Scott: There's a bad guy to get out of a tough situation.

450
00:32:19,031 --> 00:32:25,630
Rym: Now the other operative thing here is that aside from all that Vash has what a 60 billion double dollar?

451
00:32:27,311 --> 00:32:28,495
Rym: Bounty on his head.

452
00:32:28,757 --> 00:32:36,530
Scott: so people if they find out who Vash the stampede is They immediately want to arrest him and bring him in to get 60 billion double dollar.

453
00:32:36,731 --> 00:32:40,761
Rym: So pretty much everyone in the world is after Vash the stampede.

454
00:32:41,202 --> 00:32:47,930
Rym: and if this guy really is Vash the stampede He's really kind of a doofus, but yet not really.

455
00:32:48,352 --> 00:32:59,270
Rym: I mean we talked about master Keaton and you know master Keaton was kind of a doofus But he was actually badass or irresponsible captain Tyler who was kind of a deuce doofus, but he was actually really bad.

456
00:33:00,452 --> 00:33:05,294
Scott: Yo, yeah captain Tyler was it was more of a Badass by accident.

457
00:33:05,334 --> 00:33:08,623
Scott: Whereas Vash the stampede is clearly badass not by accident.

458
00:33:08,663 --> 00:33:11,430
Rym: Well early on it's not a hundred percent obvious.

459
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:16,510
Scott: Yeah, that's another thing is they don't let you on but then you know like something will happen even in the first episode.

460
00:33:16,671 --> 00:33:21,890
Rym: So a couple things happen and you wonder did he do that on purpose or did that just happen?

461
00:33:22,731 --> 00:33:24,398
Rym: Was that important or not?

462
00:33:24,538 --> 00:33:25,402
Rym: I can't tell.

463
00:33:25,422 --> 00:33:27,270
Scott: yeah another thing eat and try gun.

464
00:33:27,531 --> 00:33:40,946
Scott: He has a gun this and it's like this big freakin giant gun this big-ass revolver And he doesn't use it at all Until like many many episodes in like I say I think at the fifth episode he uses it.

465
00:33:41,046 --> 00:33:44,739
Scott: I don't even remember if And that you totally like wonder.

466
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:50,986
Scott: hey that guy hasn't used his gun and they make note of it And then when he finally uses it, it's like whoa, he used it.

467
00:33:51,147 --> 00:33:51,770
Scott: Holy crap.

468
00:33:52,192 --> 00:33:55,230
Rym: Now we've talked a bit about you know, the quote-unquote plot of try gun.

469
00:33:55,752 --> 00:33:57,859
Rym: Here is what the actual plot is.

470
00:33:58,763 --> 00:34:06,318
Rym: as far as I can go without spoiling things Vash the stampede is a Semi superhuman badass.

471
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:13,665
Rym: there is something up with his past that makes him Incredibly badass which becomes more and more apparent as the show goes on.

472
00:34:14,167 --> 00:34:19,678
Rym: He is also Committed unto death a pacifist.

473
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:23,889
Rym: He will not kill anyone for any reason ever.

474
00:34:24,351 --> 00:34:26,770
Scott: He won't even kill animals or anything.

475
00:34:27,152 --> 00:34:40,550
Rym: He is more opposed to Death and suicide and murder than he is to anything to the point that he would rather take a bullet From someone trying to kill him then even risk hurting someone to the point that they would die.

476
00:34:40,831 --> 00:34:46,214
Scott: Yeah, he has no problems hurting people to prevent them from killing, you know He'll freakin.

477
00:34:46,496 --> 00:34:54,414
Scott: he has no problem damaging property either, you know If he can knock down a building to save one life, he'll just do it in a second like boom There's.

478
00:34:54,434 --> 00:34:55,385
Scott: the building is knocked down.

479
00:34:55,405 --> 00:34:56,373
Scott: now He doesn't care.

480
00:34:56,654 --> 00:35:00,110
Rym: following this concept and everything we've told you this sounds like a romp.

481
00:35:00,412 --> 00:35:02,309
Rym: You've got this badass guy with a gun.

482
00:35:02,531 --> 00:35:04,079
Scott: He could just kill everyone if you wanted to.

483
00:35:04,099 --> 00:35:05,345
Rym: who's afraid to kill anyone?

484
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:10,022
Rym: as a result He gets into these really bad situations and hilarity ensues.

485
00:35:10,203 --> 00:35:11,467
Rym: You've got these insurance agents.

486
00:35:11,487 --> 00:35:12,270
Rym: You've got this bounty.

487
00:35:12,551 --> 00:35:18,810
Rym: You've got all these crazy characters in this world all over the place going after Vash going after each other blowing stuff up.

488
00:35:19,293 --> 00:35:21,390
Rym: It's absolutely hilarious and crazy.

489
00:35:21,725 --> 00:35:33,887
Scott: Yeah Cuz you see him get stuck in a hostage situation And there's crazy killers coming in with crazy weapons and rockets and guns and he's got to find a way to stop them from killing Anyone without killing them because if he wanted to he could just shoot them all.

490
00:35:34,168 --> 00:35:40,392
Scott: but no He's got to do it in some clever and crazy way and that's what makes every episode of the show Awesome.

491
00:35:40,633 --> 00:35:49,230
Scott: now is regardless of the overall plot you have this incredibly interesting Monster of the week solution to find out now after a few episodes.

492
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:51,663
Rym: They're hardly ever monsters because it doesn't take that long.

493
00:35:51,703 --> 00:35:57,069
Rym: the show fairly quickly Takes a very dramatic turn and it starts hinting at it bit by bit.

494
00:35:57,531 --> 00:36:07,601
Rym: He meets this priest named wolf wood who for various reasons is a gunslinger like Vash But unlike Vash is not a pacifist and he's actually.

495
00:36:07,621 --> 00:36:22,150
Rym: he's a good man, but he will kill people to save other people Mm-hmm, and all these other characters come and go but there's a point at which the show Very suddenly and very dramatically takes a turn from which it never recovers.

496
00:36:22,257 --> 00:36:28,367
Scott: Yeah It's a 26 episode show and in the 17th episode they reveal to you basically everything like.

497
00:36:28,387 --> 00:36:33,006
Scott: you'll start the episode 17 and you will not realize this is an episode of trygun.

498
00:36:33,026 --> 00:36:34,010
Scott: You'll say hey, what's wrong?

499
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:35,576
Scott: What this isn't look like trygun to me.

500
00:36:35,857 --> 00:36:36,802
Scott: and then it is and you go.

501
00:36:37,022 --> 00:36:37,605
Scott: Oh, yeah.

502
00:36:37,846 --> 00:36:38,007
Rym: Yeah.

503
00:36:38,087 --> 00:36:42,706
Rym: Well, there's two points I really want to talk about because these are kind of the two linchpins where you start to think.

504
00:36:42,766 --> 00:36:46,197
Rym: the first one you think Wow This show isn't really what I expected.

505
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:49,150
Rym: and then the second point where you don't even know what to say.

506
00:36:49,451 --> 00:36:51,298
Rym: Yeah, cuz it's silly and silly and silly.

507
00:36:51,619 --> 00:36:54,630
Rym: and then he gets on this train this land train.

508
00:36:54,690 --> 00:37:01,100
Scott: It's kind of like a cruise ship or a train but it goes over more like a cruise ship That doesn't have tracks and it goes across the desert.

509
00:37:01,561 --> 00:37:02,485
Rym: Yeah, but it's very like.

510
00:37:02,505 --> 00:37:03,870
Rym: it's kind of hard to control all this.

511
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:05,118
Rym: whatever it's this big thing.

512
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:08,977
Rym: think the Titanic in a desert and He's on it.

513
00:37:09,299 --> 00:37:18,161
Rym: and simultaneously this terrorist thief guy what dynamite neon something Dynamo, whatever is whatever the hell is awesome.

514
00:37:18,201 --> 00:37:27,030
Rym: regardless this crazy terrorist thief guy Hijacks it to try to get all the money, you know, basically Robin out of the safe.

515
00:37:27,091 --> 00:37:28,301
Scott: There's a big safe on the thing.

516
00:37:28,845 --> 00:37:29,430
Rym: open the safe.

517
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:42,265
Rym: So he decides he's going to turn the engines all the way up hold everyone hostage Ram this thing into the wall of a cliff thus Busting it up killing everyone on it opening the giant safe and then he can loot it at his leisure.

518
00:37:42,285 --> 00:37:50,835
Rym: Yeah now You think all right Vashj is gonna fight this crazy guy all on his own and he meets this little kid and there's gonna be This all sort of hilarious fight.

519
00:37:51,397 --> 00:38:06,490
Rym: and but the thing is as he's trying to save these people He starts he gets in situations where you know a guard or one of these Hijackers is there and the easy solution would be just kill him and everything would be fine, but he hesitates.

520
00:38:06,731 --> 00:38:07,554
Rym: He won't kill.

521
00:38:07,835 --> 00:38:15,922
Rym: In fact at one point he accidentally shoots one of them and wastes time Sitting there bandaging them and trying to do everything you can to make sure they don't die.

522
00:38:15,942 --> 00:38:22,909
Rym: and he gets shot a couple times Because he's so averse to killing that he really can't do this.

523
00:38:23,613 --> 00:38:25,002
Rym: Yeah, and I mean I can't.

524
00:38:25,022 --> 00:38:26,350
Rym: I'm not gonna ruin what happens in the fight.

525
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:33,442
Rym: It's probably obvious that he doesn't die because he's in pretty much the whole show But the show starts taking a turn.

526
00:38:33,462 --> 00:38:41,030
Rym: you start seeing that wow His lifestyle of being a pacifist gunfighter really isn't working out so well and isn't so easy.

527
00:38:41,592 --> 00:38:45,806
Scott: Nope, the other thing about Trigun that's really interesting and awesome is the setting.

528
00:38:45,926 --> 00:38:47,110
Scott: the setting is badass.

529
00:38:47,351 --> 00:38:59,559
Scott: What you've got basically is a giant desert Wild West world, but there's a bit of more modern technology sort of steampunk ish Sort of electricity sort of.

530
00:38:59,941 --> 00:39:02,248
Rym: yeah, there's a lot of old lost technology.

531
00:39:02,268 --> 00:39:06,490
Rym: you get a very long past post-apocalyptic setting yeah.

532
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:21,830
Scott: And you see these giant light bulbs Everywhere and they start referring to them and apparent you realize that these giant light bulbs are where all the stuff comes from to maintain Human life because there's no water or anything, you know, it all comes from these giant light bulbs.

533
00:39:22,091 --> 00:39:35,169
Rym: I mean people find old technology and adapt it and there's kind of this mishmash of ancient misunderstood, but very powerful technology and The piddly crap that humans have actually been able to come with since whatever apocalypse happened long ago.

534
00:39:35,602 --> 00:39:36,312
Scott: Yeah It's all.

535
00:39:36,452 --> 00:39:38,058
Scott: it's mostly Wild West.

536
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:43,657
Scott: and then you'll see like a giant crazy gun that shoots Whacked out stun bolt

537
00:39:43,778 --> 00:39:49,117
Rym: and you'll start picking up along the way that Vash seems to know a lot about this Technology from the ancient past

538
00:39:49,238 --> 00:39:50,483
Scott: a lot more than other people do

539
00:39:50,563 --> 00:39:52,049
Rym: and he also has some of it.

540
00:39:52,370 --> 00:40:00,880
Rym: Yeah, that you like he'll do things that seem like magic and then you start to people notice that he's got this technology That might as well be magic as far as anyone else is concerned.

541
00:40:01,342 --> 00:40:08,924
Scott: Yeah, it's just really interesting Setting because it's post-apocalyptic Western desert steampunk technology.

542
00:40:09,546 --> 00:40:16,046
Rym: way cool now I said that the show has two points where it takes turns and I already talked about the first one.

543
00:40:16,086 --> 00:40:24,410
Rym: now up until this Anyone who has actually opposed Vash or tried to hurt him or hurt people around him has been very swiftly dispatched.

544
00:40:24,511 --> 00:40:26,489
Rym: Vash just steamrollers through anyone.

545
00:40:26,811 --> 00:40:29,643
Scott: It's sort of like initial D where he wins he wins he wins he wins he wins.

546
00:40:30,125 --> 00:40:44,124
Rym: and then there's an episode Near the middle where a guy not to reveal any story But there is a man who goes to a city and starts indiscriminately killing people left and right murdering people in cold blood.

547
00:40:44,144 --> 00:40:49,422
Rym: Oh, yeah that part and Vash is trying to save these people and he can't.

548
00:40:49,683 --> 00:40:51,950
Rym: people are dying and there's almost nothing he can do.

549
00:40:52,332 --> 00:41:01,369
Rym: He's doing everything he can to get out of this city and the guy Realizes that the best way to draw Vash out is just to start murdering people and then Vash loses it.

550
00:41:01,831 --> 00:41:07,752
Rym: And he there's the scene where Vash takes this guy out and he's got him on the ground and he's got a gun in his Mouth.

551
00:41:08,155 --> 00:41:10,590
Rym: and Vash you can see that he wants to pull the trigger.

552
00:41:10,991 --> 00:41:14,684
Rym: He really wants to pull the trigger and he's just screaming over and over again.

553
00:41:14,724 --> 00:41:15,386
Rym: You killed them.

554
00:41:15,747 --> 00:41:16,410
Rym: They're dead.

555
00:41:16,831 --> 00:41:18,755
Rym: They can't come back hot.

556
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:19,817
Rym: I should kill you.

557
00:41:19,837 --> 00:41:22,263
Rym: There's no reason why I shouldn't kill you.

558
00:41:22,283 --> 00:41:24,929
Rym: and it this scene is.

559
00:41:26,133 --> 00:41:31,819
Rym: It might sound silly especially as silly as the show may sound but starting at this point That is a chilling scene.

560
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:35,436
Scott: I think that's like episode 13. ish Yeah 11, 12, 13.

561
00:41:35,436 --> 00:41:40,289
Rym: that is one of the most chilling like spine tingling scenes I've seen in anime.

562
00:41:40,584 --> 00:41:42,869
Scott: Yeah So the show starts to get dark like up until then.

563
00:41:43,371 --> 00:41:48,450
Scott: Crazy stuff happens and you get the idea of you know, what people's feelings are and the characters are developed.

564
00:41:48,792 --> 00:41:50,460
Scott: But it hasn't actually gotten dark yet.

565
00:41:50,541 --> 00:42:01,722
Scott: This is like sudden darkness Like there's even a scene I think at the end of one of the episodes or like dark and Vash is there with like these Blue glowing eyes and it's all kind of whoa.

566
00:42:01,782 --> 00:42:02,023
Rym: Yeah.

567
00:42:02,163 --> 00:42:03,930
Rym: Yes, but it starts with this one scene.

568
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:17,517
Rym: It is just I say chilling over and over but this if you haven't seen the show before you'll get to this point And I almost guarantee that you'll shiver a little bit when that happens and Vash is there with this guy And all these people are dead.

569
00:42:17,537 --> 00:42:22,814
Rym: Yep, and from there the show becomes Absolutely amazing.

570
00:42:23,255 --> 00:42:23,416
Scott: Yep.

571
00:42:23,857 --> 00:42:24,780
Scott: Now the ending.

572
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:29,215
Scott: some people have different opinions of the ending, you know It's it.

573
00:42:29,436 --> 00:42:31,405
Scott: it really depends on what you wanted to happen.

574
00:42:31,425 --> 00:42:32,530
Scott: What did happen?

575
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:40,417
Rym: Well, there's also I mean there are several kind of plot linchpins near the end of the show where I mean I can't ruin this at all.

576
00:42:40,598 --> 00:42:43,110
Rym: No, I will say that there is a scene in the show.

577
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:57,290
Rym: it is famous among the front row crew because we watched all of try gun as like 320 by 200 real video Fan subs with separate subtitle tracks in Scott's dorm room a long time ago.

578
00:42:57,631 --> 00:43:11,470
Rym: And there is an episode where something a character dies Mm-hmm a character dies and it is widely regarded among anime fans as one of the most well-written And well-acted death scenes in the history of anime.

579
00:43:11,551 --> 00:43:19,770
Rym: I'm sure anime world order will come up with other ones But I don't think anyone can disagree with me that this is a very very well done death scene.

580
00:43:20,352 --> 00:43:24,227
Scott: The thing is I don't think it happens that way in the manga whatever.

581
00:43:24,408 --> 00:43:27,337
Rym: Yeah Forget the manga.

582
00:43:27,377 --> 00:43:36,070
Rym: Yeah, forget it, but we're all guys like you're manly at freshman in college The world is our oyster and we're at a tech school and we're all standing around and we all know each other.

583
00:43:36,211 --> 00:43:37,399
Rym: We're not really close friends yet.

584
00:43:37,419 --> 00:43:45,584
Rym: The front row crew is burgeoning it hasn't quite blossomed yet and We're all standing there and the scene happens and everyone's just kind of really quiet.

585
00:43:46,005 --> 00:43:53,443
Rym: and finally like I think Someone turns to me and I look and I see that they've got Tears in their eyes and I've got tears in my eyes.

586
00:43:53,765 --> 00:43:55,853
Rym: We were all crying I'm not.

587
00:43:56,014 --> 00:44:02,629
Rym: we were all seriously crying and trying to hide it from each other and then we all Realized that we were all crying and then we all started crying.

588
00:44:03,452 --> 00:44:09,190
Rym: So happens and then I think like some I think your roommate was in the room or he walked in and he was like why?

589
00:44:09,795 --> 00:44:16,487
Rym: Yeah, he was just a soccer dude Yeah, but he walks in all these guys watching this tiny cartoon and crying their eyes out.

590
00:44:16,788 --> 00:44:24,210
Rym: Yep But I to this day if I even hear the song that plays during that death scene I get kind of emotional.

591
00:44:24,331 --> 00:44:25,159
Rym: I tear up a little bit.

592
00:44:25,179 --> 00:44:26,329
Rym: That's a really powerful scene.

593
00:44:27,454 --> 00:44:28,438
Rym: The show really.

594
00:44:28,459 --> 00:44:31,130
Rym: the issues at stake are actually very simple.

595
00:44:31,732 --> 00:44:34,522
Rym: It has to do with what motivates people to live.

596
00:44:35,124 --> 00:44:38,612
Rym: what motivates people to kill is Killing right.

597
00:44:39,034 --> 00:44:44,770
Rym: Is it ever morally acceptable to kill someone and you keep like Vashil be put in more and more situations?

598
00:44:45,354 --> 00:44:47,630
Rym: I could kill this one person to save this one person.

599
00:44:48,111 --> 00:44:50,358
Rym: I could kill this one person to save these ten people.

600
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:54,674
Rym: I could kill this one person to save every other human being on this planet.

601
00:44:55,058 --> 00:44:58,717
Rym: yep, and Vashil's boss is a pacifist.

602
00:44:58,777 --> 00:45:03,330
Rym: He does not want to kill and this is a very difficult and almost untenable position.

603
00:45:04,193 --> 00:45:09,030
Scott: And the big metaphor they use the whole show is like should you kill the spider to save?

604
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:12,808
Scott: You know the fly that's caught in its web or should you not you know?

605
00:45:13,490 --> 00:45:21,750
Rym: Yeah Which is made to very stupid melodramatic effect in an otherwise very popular anime music video done to this show.

606
00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:27,454
Rym: Yeah Yeah, one of those videos that ends with a bunch of text like that Video.

607
00:45:27,554 --> 00:45:31,550
Scott: if that music video took out its text captions to be a lot better Yeah, anyway.

608
00:45:31,851 --> 00:45:37,208
Rym: But I mean the show really gets into a lot of very deep issues and doesn't give you easy answers.

609
00:45:37,248 --> 00:45:40,458
Rym: a lot of shows will pose a question like is it okay to kill?

610
00:45:40,498 --> 00:45:41,702
Scott: or yeah like a Gundam show?

611
00:45:41,742 --> 00:45:44,110
Scott: a Gundam show will say is it you know?

612
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:47,281
Scott: Should you protect your friends and shoot at your other friends at the end?

613
00:45:47,321 --> 00:45:49,710
Scott: It says no everyone gets along and war is bad.

614
00:45:49,991 --> 00:45:56,293
Rym: Yeah, I mean the morals are very simple or even if they're complex a lot of shows tend to give you a very direct answer At the end like

615
00:45:56,394 --> 00:46:01,014
Scott: even if you don't like the answer they might give you an answer you disagree with But they give you an answer.

616
00:46:01,054 --> 00:46:02,759
Scott: that is the opinion of the creators.

617
00:46:03,161 --> 00:46:10,041
Rym: Trigon's answers are very up in the air Very half and half and very uncomfortable.

618
00:46:10,382 --> 00:46:12,810
Scott: I think that's sort of why people don't like the ending so much.

619
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:15,421
Scott: I mean not it's not a solid.

620
00:46:15,442 --> 00:46:16,506
Scott: is the answer?

621
00:46:16,526 --> 00:46:17,671
Scott: yay It's.

622
00:46:18,694 --> 00:46:25,030
Rym: I mean depending on how you look at it the show says two very very important and controversial things that are directly opposed.

623
00:46:25,511 --> 00:46:32,250
Rym: It says that you shouldn't ever kill ever and that killing another sentient being is never the answer to a problem.

624
00:46:32,813 --> 00:46:50,157
Rym: And at the same time it is saying that that position is Entirely untenable and will cause far more suffering in the world than then not then killing a single person could ever do Yep, and it doesn't really say which way is the right way Don't don't?

625
00:46:50,358 --> 00:46:52,330
Rym: I have my opinion as to what it's saying.

626
00:46:52,691 --> 00:46:57,290
Rym: I can't back that up without spoiling the entire show or asking some Japanese people.

627
00:47:00,014 --> 00:47:02,590
Scott: See I think that's part of what makes the anime so cool.

628
00:47:02,971 --> 00:47:03,814
Scott: Is that it's?

629
00:47:04,035 --> 00:47:08,790
Scott: basically they took the characters and the setting from this manga and the manga had none of this message.

630
00:47:09,131 --> 00:47:11,942
Scott: I mean you might be able to say it does but it fucking doesn't.

631
00:47:12,343 --> 00:47:13,207
Scott: it's just action.

632
00:47:13,267 --> 00:47:14,721
Scott: and whatever The

633
00:47:14,761 --> 00:47:16,746
Rym: manga is gunslingers shoot wild

634
00:47:16,786 --> 00:47:29,670
Scott: west steampunk craziness God knows and then they somehow take those characters and redesign them a little bit and they take the setting and they simplify it a bit and they take the part of the plot and a few of the like.

635
00:47:30,252 --> 00:47:41,571
Scott: You know one-off little separate storylines in the manga like a few of the early episodes are actually Sort of like just single chapters from the manga expanded to a 20-something minute episode You know.

636
00:47:41,993 --> 00:47:48,549
Scott: and they somehow take all that and they add so much to it and shift it around Into something that actually doesn't suck.

637
00:47:49,232 --> 00:47:55,029
Scott: usually people take like a great manga and they'll either make like a direct translation to an anime.

638
00:47:55,049 --> 00:48:01,009
Scott: or They'll leave stuff out in the anime or they'll change it in the anime and it doesn't turn out as well.

639
00:48:01,584 --> 00:48:13,929
Scott: You know The only other example I can think of that does it as nicely as trygun is initial D Where they change the order of like a bunch of the races for the first season of the anime to actually increase the dramatic Effect instead of decrease it.

640
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:22,326
Rym: So if you've never seen trygun or if you stopped watching it after the first three episodes seem like just a generic comedy I highly recommend just watch the first 12 or 13 episodes.

641
00:48:23,452 --> 00:48:27,350
Rym: If you I mean, it's not that hard to get a hold of if you can Netflix it you can buy it super cheap.

642
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:29,237
Scott: Yeah, you could buy this thing super cheap.

643
00:48:29,277 --> 00:48:38,408
Scott: now a genie on I think is still putting it out and they have like super Special cheapo like anime watchers choice DVDs that are stupid cheap.

644
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:41,390
Rym: I Can't recommend this show highly enough.

645
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:51,280
Rym: It is dead seriously one of my top five anime and I don't think anyone can watch this show Without at least tearing up a little bit.

646
00:48:51,701 --> 00:48:52,565
Scott: No, not the whole thing.

647
00:48:53,027 --> 00:48:53,850
Rym: Yeah, not the whole thing.

648
00:48:54,051 --> 00:48:57,206
Scott: You could be a cruel heartless bastard, but you could have seen it already and then it won't.

649
00:48:57,246 --> 00:49:00,662
Rym: probably won't work on you Yeah, or someone could have spoiled a bunch of things for you.

650
00:49:01,124 --> 00:49:05,235
Scott: Oh, it says let's see Looking on Amazon.

651
00:49:05,255 --> 00:49:07,221
Scott: You can get the whole thing for $70.

652
00:49:07,221 --> 00:49:08,084
Scott: That's a little bit steep.

653
00:49:08,184 --> 00:49:10,110
Rym: Yeah, I'd Netflix it if anything.

654
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:10,299
Rym: Yeah

655
00:49:10,551 --> 00:49:25,849
Scott: Netflix is definitely a way to go because Another thing is if you even if you don't like the serious part of the show The first four episodes are really funny like there's a lot of hilarity going on early in the show This joke after joke of you know crazy stuff happening.

656
00:49:26,391 --> 00:49:32,890
Scott: You know as this guy does this guy's acting like a doofus and doing wacky shit to get out of crazy situations.

657
00:49:33,273 --> 00:49:37,533
Scott: But the bad guys are all like comically Strange.

658
00:49:37,593 --> 00:49:40,203
Rym: it's like miss critical moment only with a gun.

659
00:49:40,424 --> 00:49:41,227
Scott: Yeah, it's.

660
00:49:41,267 --> 00:49:45,870
Scott: it's very funny Especially the ensure a lot of the supporting cast is comical early on.

661
00:49:46,010 --> 00:49:55,570
Rym: Just remember that the show is not all that it seems and you will very quickly be drawn into a very deep very complex discussion on the nature of pacifism and life.

662
00:49:57,513 --> 00:50:00,024
Rym: And it's also if you watch long enough.

663
00:50:00,084 --> 00:50:01,610
Rym: the show is hard science fiction.

664
00:50:02,132 --> 00:50:07,210
Rym: That's all I'm going to say because to do anything else would spoil a lot in the future.

665
00:50:07,310 --> 00:50:18,412
Rym: We are going to do another episode on Tragen where we'll talk about all the spoiler points because I have very Specific views on what this show was about and what I think it was trying to say and I would really like to talk about That.

666
00:50:18,835 --> 00:50:24,805
Rym: well, you'll get your chance someday someday some but I want to give all of our listeners a chance to watch the show.

667
00:50:24,865 --> 00:50:34,812
Rym: cuz while I Sometimes agree with Dave and Joel's fast karate for the gentlemen statute of limitations on spoilers at the same time It's not worth it to spoil the show for anyone.
