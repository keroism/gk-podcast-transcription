00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,922
Rym: It's Wednesday January 13th 2016.

2
00:00:11,922 --> 00:00:15,393
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:15,714 --> 00:00:19,528
Rym: instead of talking about hog hawks We're talking about my little pony.

4
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:29,498
Rym: friendship is magic in its continuance since we talked about it once a long time ago and More ponies to come out since then and I did a long opener just now.

5
00:00:30,181 --> 00:00:31,506
Rym: Cuz Scott doesn't like it when I do that.

6
00:00:31,747 --> 00:00:33,153
Rym: It's not good Burma shave.

7
00:00:33,695 --> 00:00:34,699
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:35,322 --> 00:00:51,451
Rym: So I made a vow that I wouldn't talk about my bicycle commute at any point for 2015 in the beginning of GeekNights and it's now 2016 and someone reminds me I can totally talk about my bike commute again and In some sort of gift of the Magi bullshit.

9
00:00:51,491 --> 00:00:53,339
Rym: It's winter and I'm not biking to work.

10
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:54,627
Scott: Why don't you bike to work in the cold?

11
00:00:54,667 --> 00:00:55,392
Scott: I see people doing it.

12
00:00:55,693 --> 00:00:56,639
Scott: I thought it's not snowing.

13
00:00:56,981 --> 00:00:58,748
Rym: I've actually thought about it a bunch of times.

14
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,520
Scott: you like buying fancy equipment that I refuse to buy.

15
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:04,808
Rym: I already have that equipment because it's the same kind of stuff.

16
00:01:04,867 --> 00:01:06,713
Rym: I use when I ski sometimes.

17
00:01:07,395 --> 00:01:13,620
Rym: The only reason I haven't is That I usually wake up and it's kind of too late to get all that shit together.

18
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,720
Rym: Like it's a it's a production to put on the stuff to be able to bike in the cold like that.

19
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,592
Scott: Sure, but I mean if I bike to work I get there sooner than taking the subways these days.

20
00:01:21,612 --> 00:01:22,074
Rym: Yeah.

21
00:01:22,114 --> 00:01:22,515
Rym: Yeah.

22
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:25,224
Rym: Yeah That's fine though.

23
00:01:25,244 --> 00:01:25,967
Rym: Cuomo's got a plan.

24
00:01:25,987 --> 00:01:29,080
Rym: They're gonna shut down like half the subway for multiple years.

25
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:31,989
Scott: That'll make the train go faster except no won't?

26
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,575
Rym: it's all cosmetic work primarily.

27
00:01:33,595 --> 00:01:33,996
Rym: Yeah.

28
00:01:34,056 --> 00:01:36,331
Scott: No, it'll make the train go faster Skipping those stations.

29
00:01:36,371 --> 00:01:40,660
Rym: Oh in the interim At least they're not shutting down my station.

30
00:01:40,861 --> 00:01:45,760
Scott: So and they're shutting down only one of the two stations that are equidistant from me on the same train.

31
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,460
Rym: So they might shut down the L into Manhattan, which actually might be a disaster.

32
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,840
Rym: I think more humans commute on that subway then live in most counties in the US.

33
00:01:55,302 --> 00:02:00,120
Rym: Good like I think I think more economic harm will happen by that one subway line being down.

34
00:02:00,481 --> 00:02:04,640
Scott: Then if multiple cities got nuked in the US, I mean, this is a person who's on the way out, right?

35
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,479
Scott: You know, it's like he's basically just fucking everything up on the way out like aha

36
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,384
Rym: Yeah, if you

37
00:02:10,425 --> 00:02:14,140
Scott: wouldn't do this at the start of your term because then you get unelected the next time

38
00:02:14,881 --> 00:02:18,135
Rym: He's doing all this stuff and then he's doing all this PR saying hey, New York.

39
00:02:18,417 --> 00:02:23,779
Rym: I got your back I think the regular old Democrats not to get into New York State politics too much.

40
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:38,580
Rym: We're worried that yeah Cuomo won the governorship But Zephyr teach-out got like the majority of the vote in New York City Of course cities starting to turn against upstate real hard because upstate can eat a dick.

41
00:02:39,203 --> 00:02:40,391
Rym: But I digress.

42
00:02:40,592 --> 00:02:41,558
Rym: that's my opening bed.

43
00:02:42,741 --> 00:02:44,527
Rym: That's what I got for the first part.

44
00:02:44,547 --> 00:02:48,179
Scott: They're all the most all 99.9 percent of listeners who don't live in New York.

45
00:02:48,804 --> 00:02:49,529
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

46
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,396
Rym: You guys should live in New York.

47
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:53,253
Scott: You should even if they did live in New York.

48
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:56,469
Scott: if this is the New York podcast No one wants to hear about are you getting?

49
00:02:56,489 --> 00:02:57,153
Rym: that's all guy.

50
00:02:57,214 --> 00:02:58,280
Rym: I subscribe to the Gothamist.

51
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,258
Rym: That's all the Gothamist is is stuff like that?

52
00:03:01,341 --> 00:03:03,090
Rym: It's just like hey, no, look at this thing.

53
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,180
Scott: I subscribe to the Gothamist for pizza rat stories.

54
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,946
Rym: Do you see how pizza rat was fabricated?

55
00:03:07,267 --> 00:03:10,438
Rym: That's fine that same person you fabricated all those rat videos.

56
00:03:10,618 --> 00:03:10,980
Scott: I don't care.

57
00:03:11,181 --> 00:03:11,925
Scott: Yeah, I'm just.

58
00:03:11,946 --> 00:03:12,972
Scott: I mean I see I have.

59
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:14,180
Scott: that's the level everything.

60
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,286
Rym: I mean, I don't trust any.

61
00:03:15,306 --> 00:03:17,700
Rym: get you guys probably heard about our pizza rat.

62
00:03:17,941 --> 00:03:21,340
Rym: You have no idea that there was a conspiracy to create pizza rat.

63
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,588
Scott: I mean, you know, I don't believe anything.

64
00:03:23,608 --> 00:03:26,740
Rym: I read the internet anyway, so yeah, I mean it did happen.

65
00:03:26,821 --> 00:03:27,934
Rym: It was just contrived.

66
00:03:28,177 --> 00:03:32,300
Rym: Sure It's like when you see two cosplayers do a funny skit in the middle of an anime con.

67
00:03:32,623 --> 00:03:33,995
Rym: They plan that shit ahead of time.

68
00:03:34,156 --> 00:03:34,580
Scott: No kidding.

69
00:03:35,242 --> 00:03:42,980
Rym: So, uh in other news bunch of Anna Twitter was sort of talking about how Netflix changed the way categories work and how?

70
00:03:43,221 --> 00:03:47,557
Rym: Anime just shows up in its normal category instead of in the anime category.

71
00:03:47,618 --> 00:03:48,220
Rym: Hooray.

72
00:03:48,602 --> 00:03:52,600
Rym: So I thought hey, that'll be good news for GeekNights cuz I get a lot to say about that.

73
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,303
Scott: But is it true?

74
00:03:53,323 --> 00:04:01,729
Rym: Yeah, so I went poking around and there was no article saying that this happened and I basically had to do some investigative journalism.

75
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:05,240
Rym: So I logged into Netflix actually forgot my password for Netflix.

76
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:10,100
Rym: So it took me a minute and I logged in and sure enough the anime category is still there.

77
00:04:10,825 --> 00:04:21,880
Rym: But if you go to sci-fi Sci-fi anime just show up with everything else like they're normal like they're just popular media alongside some cartoons.

78
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:34,880
Scott: I really like to see that data on whether some animes get more watched or how many people who've never watched anime before watch One and things of that nature and what pages people click on anime series from to begin watching them.

79
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,596
Scott: Like our anime is only getting watched by clicks from the anime category page.

80
00:04:38,616 --> 00:04:39,560
Scott: or are they getting watches?

81
00:04:40,145 --> 00:04:41,919
Scott: You know from the sci-fi page?

82
00:04:42,445 --> 00:04:52,558
Rym: because frankly we've talked about this like tangentially on a bunch of other gig nights episodes and pretty much anyone who knows about the anime and comics industry knows about this.

83
00:04:52,578 --> 00:04:59,224
Rym: but Basically anime and manga are crazy popular in the u.s Mad popular.

84
00:04:59,404 --> 00:05:05,369
Rym: yet the press talks about comics like they sell at all Like they're like, oh they talk about.

85
00:05:05,489 --> 00:05:09,485
Rym: oh some Superman comic sold You know 10,000 copies.

86
00:05:09,565 --> 00:05:09,926
Rym: crazy.

87
00:05:09,987 --> 00:05:20,080
Rym: Holy shit, and they kind of forget that like any given shit Oh manga sells more than like the sit like number two through number nine in the top ten lists.

88
00:05:20,301 --> 00:05:25,053
Scott: I mean attack on Titan out sells like Batman and Superman and all that stuff.

89
00:05:25,093 --> 00:05:25,474
Rym: Yeah,

90
00:05:25,675 --> 00:05:25,876
Scott: so

91
00:05:25,936 --> 00:05:37,900
Rym: the media coverage of American comics Makes it seem like they're very popular But in reality they pretty much get outsold by random shoujo manga number four

92
00:05:38,101 --> 00:05:46,720
Scott: The New York Times has two as two lists, you know, because they manage all these bestseller lists and you know This is the main, you know, New York Times bestseller list of books of novels, right?

93
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:54,108
Scott: but they have a whole bunch of other ones way down there and they have a graphic novel bestseller list and then they have a separate Manga bestseller list.

94
00:05:54,149 --> 00:05:55,174
Scott: and why do they have this?

95
00:05:55,234 --> 00:05:56,199
Scott: because they didn't have it.

96
00:05:56,782 --> 00:05:58,574
Scott: It would just be the manga bestseller list.

97
00:05:58,634 --> 00:06:04,660
Scott: because you know Even the top things on the not manga bestseller list like don't come close.

98
00:06:05,121 --> 00:06:07,913
Scott: Yeah, it's like what's near the top of the graphic novel bestsellers.

99
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:12,520
Scott: good stuff really great stuff Like I think Kate beaten princess and the pony was up there.

100
00:06:12,642 --> 00:06:13,599
Rym: That's good stuff.

101
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:19,835
Scott: But as much as I love Kate beaten and bought that book and you should do and buy the stuffed animal But I didn't buy that.

102
00:06:21,023 --> 00:06:22,629
Scott: It doesn't outsell attack on Titan.

103
00:06:23,051 --> 00:06:35,596
Rym: So I think this is a really big deal because Most people I know who got into anime from nothing who aren't just ultra nerds Get into it either because a friend tricks him into watching some anime and they're like, oh shit.

104
00:06:35,617 --> 00:06:41,080
Rym: That was good or They stumble onto it because they were looking for a sci-fi movie.

105
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:46,690
Scott: Well, it's also you know people when they think of the popular of anime They try to think of like the number of anime fans.

106
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:53,074
Scott: and first of all that number is a lot bigger than people think They're just not paying attention to the fact how big like anime Expo is.

107
00:06:53,134 --> 00:06:54,900
Rym: Yeah, I mean you're talking about comic cons.

108
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,652
Rym: All right, there's two or three comic cons that are big most comic cons.

109
00:06:58,773 --> 00:07:00,860
Rym: I have attendance in the thousands.

110
00:07:01,262 --> 00:07:09,160
Rym: Meanwhile Otakon if you count the way comic cons do has like 90,000 plus people at it and no one talks about it, right?

111
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,160
Scott: So you also had to consider the fact is all these people who aren't anime fans, right?

112
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,805
Scott: They wouldn't say that they're an anime fan.

113
00:07:16,126 --> 00:07:17,891
Scott: They don't go to anime news network.

114
00:07:18,112 --> 00:07:20,640
Scott: They don't follow anime people on Twitter, right?

115
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,394
Scott: They don't go to anime convention, but they watch an anime.

116
00:07:23,514 --> 00:07:24,600
Scott: They watch a lot of animes.

117
00:07:24,701 --> 00:07:28,888
Rym: I know I run into a lot of people who've seen my mom My mom watches animes.

118
00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:36,817
Scott: all the kids at the high school know what Dragon Ball is Right, even today high school kids like kids who are 16 right now watch Dragon Ball know what it is, right?

119
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,505
Scott: Yeah, you know, they know that Soul Leaders Like, you know.

120
00:07:41,705 --> 00:07:46,460
Scott: now if you ask them if they're an anime fan, they'd be like no, but you know They're into like video games or something.

121
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:52,940
Rym: Maybe they're right but but this is a big deal because the anime ghetto has to go away in certain like in Netflix and everything.

122
00:07:54,301 --> 00:07:55,766
Scott: All ghettos need to go away.

123
00:07:55,786 --> 00:07:57,794
Rym: No, yeah, that's the whole point of gig nights.

124
00:07:57,874 --> 00:07:59,600
Rym: geek, you know broaden your horizons.

125
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:08,444
Rym: you should listen to all the gig nights and be into games and anime and Politics even though Scott's not into politics, but I am I'm a nerd about politics But anyway time.

126
00:08:08,524 --> 00:08:12,000
Rym: so I yeah, I'm right here in the sci-fi and fantasy on Netflix.

127
00:08:12,382 --> 00:08:19,257
Rym: So there's that old live-action He-Man Masters of the Universe Jules Verne center Jules Verne center of the earth like the old.

128
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:22,030
Scott: Oh, yeah Center the earth is a good book.

129
00:08:22,352 --> 00:08:26,290
Rym: the forgotten berserk Oh that anime berserk is just hanging out right here.

130
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:32,631
Rym: next to all that shit some Star Trek Full metal alchemist is in here little witch academia.

131
00:08:32,753 --> 00:08:33,134
Rym: Oh shit.

132
00:08:33,174 --> 00:08:34,337
Rym: The little witch academia is here.

133
00:08:34,357 --> 00:08:38,196
Rym: Mm-hmm I forgot that came out like we should watch that like real soon.

134
00:08:38,216 --> 00:08:43,339
Rym: Yep uh, I cannot stress to you enough how important it is that Netflix did this.

135
00:08:43,359 --> 00:08:48,336
Rym: and Also how don't subscribe to crunchyroll just subscribe to Hulu.

136
00:08:48,376 --> 00:08:49,400
Rym: most of the anime is in there.

137
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,693
Scott: That's where most crunchyrolls adding a bunch of new animes recently.

138
00:08:52,713 --> 00:08:55,905
Scott: I mean new to crunchyroll anime Yeah, but it's like.

139
00:08:56,266 --> 00:09:00,280
Scott: Hulu has all the anime you actually want to watch right now and you can get the ad-free version.

140
00:09:01,463 --> 00:09:05,340
Scott: I guess if you finish watching everything on Hulu Then you could sign up for crunchyroll and watch the other stuff.

141
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,036
Scott: The one thing I miss from the crunchyroll who doesn't have are the weirdo anime.

142
00:09:10,096 --> 00:09:16,957
Rym: Yeah, right Like folk tales from Japan, which is still one of my favorite shows our news Our news.

143
00:09:18,463 --> 00:09:20,614
Scott: You know the weirdo ones, but that's okay.

144
00:09:20,795 --> 00:09:23,989
Rym: Yeah, I mean she by denial, yeah that one.

145
00:09:24,813 --> 00:09:41,649
Rym: so in other news we were talking about this before the show, but there's an old penny arcade comic where one of the characters like is off and there's two characters sitting there and suddenly a weird clock rings and the stars align and Someone's like that clock.

146
00:09:41,729 --> 00:09:43,820
Scott: never you don't remember what that comic was about.

147
00:09:44,423 --> 00:09:46,656
Rym: And then Gabe jumps in being like hit points.

148
00:09:47,118 --> 00:09:52,139
Scott: mana Right because basically, you know at that time period right?

149
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:58,200
Scott: Mike Krahulik right Gabe was a person who did not play the RPGs at all.

150
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:02,375
Scott: He was not didn't play didn't play the Final Fantasies or the dnds, right?

151
00:10:02,656 --> 00:10:03,880
Rym: So he wasn't paying attention.

152
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:06,539
Scott: the Jerry Holkins.

153
00:10:07,445 --> 00:10:11,566
Scott: You know the tight the bald taiko In the comic.

154
00:10:11,766 --> 00:10:21,807
Scott: he was the D&D dice-rolling type of person and You know at that point in time is when you know the clock rang For the first time.

155
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:25,260
Scott: and now Mike Krahulik is like making RPGs and shit.

156
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:31,220
Rym: He's like the D&D master, but that you know, I feel like the Lupin clock might be ringing again.

157
00:10:31,441 --> 00:10:32,930
Scott: Yeah, it's not a clock that never rings.

158
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:34,520
Scott: It's a clock that hasn't rung in a while.

159
00:10:34,922 --> 00:10:41,209
Rym: Yeah, well he had played RPGs other RPGs in the past just kind of stops Like them and we want to play.

160
00:10:41,229 --> 00:10:41,310
Scott: that.

161
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:47,319
Rym: I mean remember when PC gaming was dead Yeah, and then suddenly there was a tolling in the distance and gave in.

162
00:10:47,359 --> 00:10:50,559
Scott: well You know Lupin is one of those things with the people in charge of it.

163
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:55,300
Scott: So wisely, you know bring it up and hide it away and then bring it up and hide away.

164
00:10:55,381 --> 00:10:56,247
Scott: It was always there.

165
00:10:56,287 --> 00:10:56,851
Scott: you'd get old.

166
00:10:56,972 --> 00:10:58,361
Rym: thing is it is always there It's just.

167
00:10:58,381 --> 00:11:01,855
Rym: there's a lot of shitty Lupin's that came out for a long time.

168
00:11:01,975 --> 00:11:16,520
Rym: Not like not recently though Yeah, so pretty Fujiko Mine came out and it was crazy good and it brought a style of animation and storytelling that Deeply rustles my jimmies in a good way and that shows fantastic.

169
00:11:17,182 --> 00:11:22,100
Rym: So a bunch more Lupin came out after that in a similar style like the grave of jig and dice.

170
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,680
Scott: There's a brand new Lupin likes the fourth season or whatever.

171
00:11:25,981 --> 00:11:32,349
Rym: So Emily and I are actually going through from Fujiko Mine Onward of every Lupin that's come out since then.

172
00:11:32,369 --> 00:11:34,015
Rym: we're just watching them as fast as we can.

173
00:11:34,135 --> 00:11:34,517
Scott: why not?

174
00:11:34,597 --> 00:11:35,340
Rym: because they're great.

175
00:11:36,002 --> 00:11:40,860
Rym: So there's a new Lupin the third TV special coming out.

176
00:11:41,161 --> 00:11:46,519
Rym: I guess it came out in January 8th, so it just came out real recently called Lupin the third the Italian game.

177
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:50,989
Rym: and My thing of the day is just you know when we get to?

178
00:11:51,049 --> 00:11:53,960
Rym: that is just the trailer for this TV special.

179
00:11:54,764 --> 00:11:57,980
Rym: But holy shit did that clock just ring so hard that it exploded?

180
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:02,640
Scott: I hope that this trailer that none of the things in the trailer are actually in the movie.

181
00:12:03,021 --> 00:12:10,180
Rym: I hope that all but one of the things in the trailer are in the movie, but happen in the first five minutes.

182
00:12:13,621 --> 00:12:19,537
Rym: Yeah, if the tree if this TV special the trailer is just a flashback Lupin has during the movie.

183
00:12:19,678 --> 00:12:25,960
Rym: yeah, holy Shit, did I forget how much I love Lupin when Lupin is good?

184
00:12:26,881 --> 00:12:29,532
Rym: Also, this is the rare blue jacket Lupin.

185
00:12:29,752 --> 00:12:31,923
Scott: Oh, yeah, yeah Not green.

186
00:12:36,861 --> 00:12:48,879
Rym: I'm not gonna talk about it any further because this is the kind of thing if you're an anime fan at all just watch It and if you're not an anime fan, and you like anything even remotely vestigially similar to James Bond watch some Lupin.

187
00:12:49,582 --> 00:12:55,620
Scott: So if you want to talk about bells that ring and ring and ring and ring and never stop ringing and never will stop ringing Even after we die.

188
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,912
Scott: Pokemon is 20 years old.

189
00:12:59,422 --> 00:13:00,386
Rym: God damn it.

190
00:13:00,507 --> 00:13:16,374
Rym: That means when Pokemon came into existence in Japan I was like 14 or something which is weird because it's kind of like that Preferage farm remembers where you kind of forget that things didn't exist forever Like I remember when Pokemon came into existence.

191
00:13:16,414 --> 00:13:17,620
Scott: I saw it in a game Pro magazine.

192
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,539
Scott: I was like oh, there's some kids game why they making a big deal out of it.

193
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:27,008
Scott: Yeah, and then my brother got it on his Gameboy pocket And then I played it a little bit and I was like, oh I didn't realize this thing.

194
00:13:27,048 --> 00:13:31,889
Scott: that looked like garbage from a few pictures of you know Pikachu was actually earthbound.

195
00:13:32,069 --> 00:13:34,840
Rym: see no one near me got into it in high school.

196
00:13:35,202 --> 00:13:40,651
Rym: So when I was at RIT, I bet like I knew what Pokemon was I didn't really care about it or think about you where I was.

197
00:13:40,671 --> 00:13:42,300
Scott: we were poke battling in high school.

198
00:13:42,601 --> 00:13:43,686
Rym: Yeah, I was not.

199
00:13:44,027 --> 00:13:51,647
Rym: so I when I started paying attention to Pokemon I just had this sense that it had been around Forever like as long as I'd lived like.

200
00:13:51,687 --> 00:13:53,614
Rym: I couldn't think back to the origin of it.

201
00:13:53,915 --> 00:13:55,059
Rym: I can yeah you can.

202
00:13:56,281 --> 00:14:07,300
Scott: So, uh, so it's 20 years old and to celebrate this 20th anniversary They're re-releasing like 3ds's that have Pokemon red or blue installed and they're doing stuff with the CCG.

203
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,860
Scott: They're basically going all out for this arbitrary number.

204
00:14:10,241 --> 00:14:14,638
Scott: I can't even imagine what they're gonna do five years from now for the 25th anniversary or the 50th.

205
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:15,902
Scott: I hope to see it.

206
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:16,264
Scott: You know what?

207
00:14:16,364 --> 00:14:17,688
Rym: So the 25th anniversary?

208
00:14:17,729 --> 00:14:21,080
Rym: because by then that Pokemon ingress AR game will be in full swing.

209
00:14:21,747 --> 00:14:26,383
Rym: so on the 25th anniversary what's gonna happen probably is Everyone's.

210
00:14:26,423 --> 00:14:29,240
Rym: pokédar is gonna start going off to set up some giant event.

211
00:14:29,387 --> 00:14:39,540
Rym: Yeah and then every kid in the world is gonna converge on like these Monoliths in the centers of cities and then the message will come in there is a gun taped to the bottom of your chair.

212
00:14:40,501 --> 00:14:41,970
Scott: So there's a Pokemon p-cross.

213
00:14:42,011 --> 00:14:45,104
Scott: I'm playing a lot right now, by the way I like p-cross.

214
00:14:45,164 --> 00:14:46,730
Scott: Why what's wrong p-cross?

215
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:47,914
Rym: boring Sudoku?

216
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:48,857
Rym: It's the same as Sudoku.

217
00:14:48,937 --> 00:14:49,740
Scott: It's better than Sudoku.

218
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:49,941
Scott: How?

219
00:14:49,961 --> 00:14:51,244
Scott: so you get a picture at the end?

220
00:14:51,264 --> 00:14:51,766
Scott: Yeah.

221
00:14:52,187 --> 00:14:54,533
Rym: Okay, you get a a one-bit picture.

222
00:14:54,553 --> 00:14:55,255
Rym: Well, I guess not one.

223
00:14:55,355 --> 00:15:04,946
Scott: also unlike Sudoku You can get really really big ones that are much more complex and interesting without making them like, you know Impossible and unfun.

224
00:15:05,468 --> 00:15:11,900
Scott: if I may if I give you a Sudoku that's like enormous with really tiny squares You know that goes to like one to a hundred in each row and column.

225
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,703
Scott: You're like fuck that.

226
00:15:12,924 --> 00:15:15,635
Scott: but if I give you a p-cross, that's like 30 by 15.

227
00:15:15,635 --> 00:15:16,760
Scott: It's like that's doable.

228
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,392
Rym: They fuck that and just play Advance Wars.

229
00:15:18,493 --> 00:15:30,630
Scott: Anyway, anyway So one other thing that they're doing that's really fascinating is they have paid for a Pokemon 20th anniversary Superb owl commercial.

230
00:15:30,651 --> 00:15:33,546
Scott: Oh I want to see this commercial.

231
00:15:33,968 --> 00:15:34,470
Rym: What are they gonna?

232
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,013
Rym: is that gonna?

233
00:15:35,113 --> 00:15:36,439
Rym: are they gonna launch something with that?

234
00:15:37,182 --> 00:15:37,523
Rym: I don't know.

235
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,007
Rym: gonna be some big launch announcement.

236
00:15:39,528 --> 00:15:43,079
Scott: a live-action commercial will air during the Superb owl on February 7th.

237
00:15:43,882 --> 00:15:46,059
Rym: I I'll bet it's for the AR stuff.

238
00:15:46,722 --> 00:15:52,080
Scott: I don't know if I will promote the 20th anniversary's train on motto train on.

239
00:15:52,381 --> 00:15:56,537
Scott: Yeah, as it as in keep on training Pokemon not get on the train.

240
00:15:56,737 --> 00:15:57,380
Rym: Yeah, maybe it is.

241
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,664
Rym: Maybe they'll introduce a train.

242
00:15:58,984 --> 00:16:00,769
Scott: I know it's train on like keep training.

243
00:16:01,351 --> 00:16:03,457
Scott: go for it trainers Pokemon training.

244
00:16:03,618 --> 00:16:11,784
Rym: Yeah Things of the day, like I said, my thing of the day is the opening to Lupin.

245
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,390
Rym: the third the Italian game.

246
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,055
Rym: Holy shit.

247
00:16:15,075 --> 00:16:17,450
Rym: Do I want to watch this real bad?

248
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:26,370
Rym: I also want to watch it pretty bad Like if you can imagine a video designed to make me filled with determination to see something.

249
00:16:26,792 --> 00:16:29,585
Rym: This is like when we saw the beginning of project blue earth cheeky.

250
00:16:29,605 --> 00:16:33,001
Rym: Oh, we were like, holy shit This has everything and then we were let down.

251
00:16:33,061 --> 00:16:34,166
Rym: so I hope this doesn't let me down.

252
00:16:34,186 --> 00:16:45,330
Scott: Hmm This is YouTube channel, I discovered by someone linked to one of their videos, which is the one I'm gonna talk about Which is called retro blasting and they basically just review really old stuff, right?

253
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:56,769
Scott: Like, you know Ninja Turtles cartoon spider-man amazing friends and you know, Indiana Jones toys from back in the day You know nerdy 80s 70s stuff, whatever.

254
00:16:57,752 --> 00:17:06,252
Scott: But the videos are well produced actually and they have this one video that is about the Dungeons & Dragons cartoon the old Now.

255
00:17:06,294 --> 00:17:08,329
Scott: that's a cartoon that you know.

256
00:17:08,871 --> 00:17:14,970
Scott: My memory of seeing like one and a half episodes was not positive because it was also it was kind of before our time.

257
00:17:15,371 --> 00:17:15,833
Scott: Yeah, it was.

258
00:17:15,873 --> 00:17:17,980
Scott: it came out basically when I was zero right ish.

259
00:17:18,623 --> 00:17:20,730
Scott: So, you know, I was not a fan of this thing.

260
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:31,285
Scott: I thought it was you know bad, you know, just old bad stuff lumped in there with he-man, but this review of it Really sort of makes a good case for why this was a good cartoon.

261
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:37,370
Scott: good like relative to Contemporary cartoons or legit good legit good like they're making a case for it.

262
00:17:37,691 --> 00:17:43,097
Scott: ah, and I kind of want to go back and verify whether that's True, but I also don't.

263
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,009
Rym: that's a dangerous direction to go.

264
00:17:45,351 --> 00:17:55,754
Scott: I think your best bet is to just instead of actually watching the D&D cartoon from back in the day Just watch this YouTube video that's actually like 26 minutes long and you'll learn everything You need to know about it.

265
00:17:55,794 --> 00:18:01,494
Rym: and see everything you need to see might give you a false impression though What if it's wrong?

266
00:18:02,035 --> 00:18:02,938
Scott: they're pretty convincing.

267
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:06,490
Rym: yeah, I could make a pretty convincing video about a thing that I made up.

268
00:18:06,691 --> 00:18:09,204
Scott: I'm not a hundred percent saying that they're right.

269
00:18:09,285 --> 00:18:10,270
Scott: I'm just saying they're convincing.

270
00:18:10,511 --> 00:18:14,883
Rym: Nah in the meta moment pecs out coming up real soon.

271
00:18:15,144 --> 00:18:16,046
Scott: Whoa pecs out.

278
00:18:47,933 --> 00:18:52,310
Rym: I got all new content now, and I found the others a new treasure trove.

279
00:18:52,551 --> 00:18:56,550
Rym: I found such a deep treasure trove and no multiple people.

280
00:18:56,991 --> 00:18:59,638
Rym: It's not the Russian anime opener treasure trove.

281
00:18:59,979 --> 00:19:00,841
Rym: I know of that.

282
00:19:01,242 --> 00:19:03,087
Rym: I found further buried gold.

283
00:19:03,107 --> 00:19:04,310
Rym: All right, Oak Island.

284
00:19:04,411 --> 00:19:05,780
Rym: I just kept digging and kept digging.

285
00:19:05,801 --> 00:19:08,305
Rym: I Think I've got enough too deep.

286
00:19:09,512 --> 00:19:10,715
Rym: Okay, I died Scott.

287
00:19:10,735 --> 00:19:16,110
Rym: I went too deep that that dramatic reading might be one step below hitting the bottom.

288
00:19:16,813 --> 00:19:19,769
Rym: There's things coming out Balrog's killing everyone in the panel room.

289
00:19:21,212 --> 00:19:22,717
Rym: But yeah, it's gonna be good times.

290
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:25,105
Rym: The mag fest schedule is looking pretty good.

291
00:19:25,145 --> 00:19:28,338
Rym: We're on like seven panels But we were split up.

292
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,085
Rym: So like we're not both on all the panels.

293
00:19:30,126 --> 00:19:30,909
Rym: So we'll see how that goes.

294
00:19:32,511 --> 00:19:33,174
Rym: Book club book.

295
00:19:33,254 --> 00:19:33,636

Rym: I'm still reading though.

297
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:38,453
Rym: I'm like book eight of the wheel of time at this point Patreon.

298
00:19:38,674 --> 00:19:47,424
Rym: I go twice on book club since you're not going but then I'll have to stop reading the wheel of time which is continuing in its steady pace of being average quality.

299
00:19:47,464 --> 00:19:50,412
Rym: fantasy book the novel, okay, and Pretty much.

300
00:19:50,472 --> 00:19:53,104
Rym: I'm just in a holding pattern until the our Scott backer book comes out.

301
00:19:53,124 --> 00:19:53,927
Rym: Mm-hmm.

302
00:19:53,947 --> 00:19:56,375
Rym: That's coming Patrons going strong.

303
00:19:56,736 --> 00:19:59,205
Rym: We're not that far away from the beta episodes thing.

304
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:00,249
Rym: We put up the December Q&A.

305
00:20:00,851 --> 00:20:05,807
Rym: So dog, I'll submission form for backers to submit questions for the January Q&A.

306
00:20:05,888 --> 00:20:06,429
Scott: Don't do this.

307
00:20:06,931 --> 00:20:13,210
Rym: However, people have said that they really like the Q&A episodes and some people really like the rims-rants things that are in there.

308
00:20:13,511 --> 00:20:16,950
Scott: You could have spent your money on something good or spent your time watching something good.

309
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:20,250
Scott: Like I don't know even that D&D cartoons probably better than GeekNights.

310
00:20:20,411 --> 00:20:23,122
Rym: I'll tell you what, if you got spare money send it to Child's Play.

311
00:20:23,383 --> 00:20:27,402
Rym: if you still have spare money Send it to Neil Cisarenga's patreon.

312
00:20:27,724 --> 00:20:30,117
Rym: and if you still got money Maybe put a little bit in our.

313
00:20:30,137 --> 00:20:30,842
Scott: buy some food.

314
00:20:30,922 --> 00:20:32,009
Scott: get a better lunch.

315
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:36,404
Scott: You know if you're eating like a peony B&J for lunch get a steak instead.

316
00:20:37,067 --> 00:20:40,646
Rym: and oh, yeah The t-shirts are still selling like one or two a week.

317
00:20:40,727 --> 00:20:44,139
Rym: So It's a good t-shirt.

318
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,075
Scott: so you go get a nice t-shirt from threadless It's a pretty nice t-shirt.

319
00:20:47,135 --> 00:20:48,039
Scott: or go to Tepedo Co.

320
00:20:48,139 --> 00:20:50,550
Scott: any any shirt on all of Tepedo Co is better than the night.

321
00:20:50,732 --> 00:20:51,729
Rym: So guys, I'll tell you what.

322
00:20:52,432 --> 00:20:59,472
Rym: I have an Amazon merch account for us and apparently they're hard to get for some reason like there's a long Backlog.

323
00:20:59,552 --> 00:21:00,716
Rym: really invite only.

324
00:21:00,736 --> 00:21:01,940
Scott: Oh, I didn't know this.

325
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,030
Rym: so I can sell up to 25 shirts at a time.

326
00:21:05,391 --> 00:21:12,016
Rym: So I'll tell you this if you want to sell a t-shirt that gets a cool one through GeekNights I'll give you like.

327
00:21:12,056 --> 00:21:13,483
Scott: you're better off selling it anywhere else.

328
00:21:13,523 --> 00:21:17,539
Scott: The profit margin is so bad Yes, but the effort level is so low.

329
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:20,710
Scott: You could just open your own web store with like a Shopify for you ever.

330
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:21,573
Rym: No, I've done that.

331
00:21:21,593 --> 00:21:21,914
Rym: Do you know what?

332
00:21:21,934 --> 00:21:23,058
Rym: you're fucking pain-in-the-ass?

333
00:21:23,078 --> 00:21:24,824
Scott: that you could just make up PayPal.

334
00:21:24,964 --> 00:21:26,329
Scott: one link for PayPal put.

335
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:28,130
Rym: no No, that's not what they're saving you.

336
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:32,130
Rym: The thing is they print on demand any size any style multiple t-shirt colors.

337
00:21:32,494 --> 00:21:34,434
Scott: If you make it a GeekNights shirt This makes sense.

338
00:21:34,475 --> 00:21:36,950
Scott: if you want to make send us a design and we'll give you the profits.

339
00:21:37,051 --> 00:21:38,843
Scott: But if you're making a shirt for your own shit, don't.

340
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:39,770
Scott: why would you do this?

341
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:46,320
Rym: No If you're just if you just have a cool shirt that you want to let us sell for you with no So many other people that will sell it for you better.

342
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:49,110
Rym: They'll take more of a cut than this takes.

343
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:51,439
Scott: No, you can go like thread lists to pay to go save a.

344
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:54,190
Rym: yeah to pay to co is invite only and there's minimum requirements.

345
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:57,963
Scott: I'm just saying if you can't meet those requirements your shirt isn't with mine.

346
00:21:58,565 --> 00:21:59,247
Rym: Yeah, let's see.

347
00:21:59,287 --> 00:22:00,150
Rym: We're about our level.

348
00:22:00,492 --> 00:22:01,537
Rym: We're not to pay to co.

349
00:22:01,617 --> 00:22:02,964
Rym: I mean, I don't know if we get to pay to go.

350
00:22:02,984 --> 00:22:04,090
Rym: We never tried to to pay to co.

351
00:22:04,644 --> 00:22:09,365
Rym: No So you may recall a time back in 2011 a heady time where?

352
00:22:10,811 --> 00:22:17,110
Rym: Someone posted in our forum saying hey guys the new my little pony show is really good and we were like what what why?

353
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:20,430
Scott: Well, and then I saw it posted a bunch of other places and then it turned out to be true.

354
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,193
Scott: So we watched it.

355
00:22:21,313 --> 00:22:21,554
Rym: Yep.

356
00:22:21,574 --> 00:22:30,042
Rym: So we didn't even get in on that pony craze until about halfway through the first season and Many of you who are close to us may remember that it hit pretty hard.

357
00:22:30,062 --> 00:22:32,875
Scott: it hit hard and then it faded but it didn't Completely fade.

358
00:22:32,956 --> 00:22:36,154
Rym: but it hit hard for like two years Hard for a while.

359
00:22:36,174 --> 00:22:41,290
Rym: there was a time a period of about two years where we pretty much just wouldn't fucking shut up about ponies.

360
00:22:41,571 --> 00:22:45,342
Rym: Mm-hmm, and I still really like ponies, but I don't talk about it every day.

361
00:22:45,362 --> 00:22:54,532
Scott: I have every single issue of the pony comic series released by IDW and that comic series is Fantastic.

362
00:22:54,592 --> 00:22:55,134
Scott: It's so good.

363
00:22:55,516 --> 00:22:55,797
Rym: It's the.

364
00:22:55,978 --> 00:22:57,383
Rym: it's better than the show right now.

365
00:22:57,624 --> 00:22:59,684
Rym: Yes other than it doesn't have music You can listen to.

366
00:22:59,868 --> 00:23:02,619
Scott: no But yeah, if you want ponies you're not getting enough.

367
00:23:03,061 --> 00:23:03,863
Scott: get the comics.

368
00:23:03,903 --> 00:23:10,050
Scott: they made this two main series which is You know friendship is magic, but there's also main like ma ne.

369
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:18,010
Scott: There's also friends forever Which is like they have multiple pony comics the same way that there's spider-man an amazing spider-man and spectacular spider-man.

370
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:21,030
Scott: Yeah, and spider-man is amazing friends spider-man 2099.

371
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:27,171
Rym: But especially if you really like the first two seasons of my little pony and then you're a little bit disappointed in like season 3.

372
00:23:27,171 --> 00:23:39,530
Scott: Quality you know as ponies is good, but the quality has varied wildly right even within the first season Which is still the best season, you know The sonic rainboom episode and they visit the dragon on the mountain episode far surpass.

373
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:43,168
Rym: Oh my god that dragon episode might have been one of the best episodes ever.

374
00:23:43,611 --> 00:23:48,357
Scott: They far surpass all other episodes and all the other seasons Right a list of all the.

375
00:23:48,498 --> 00:23:50,347
Scott: the quality goes from high to low, right?

376
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:55,909
Scott: But recently I caught up on every single episode through the newest season which is completed.

377
00:23:55,929 --> 00:23:57,276
Scott: Rym I think is a little bit behind.

378
00:23:57,336 --> 00:23:57,658
Scott: isn't that?

379
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:05,790
Rym: I've seen most of the current season But I've seen all those like rainbow rocks nonsense that I didn't see any of the ones where they're not ponies.

380
00:24:05,892 --> 00:24:06,686
Rym: So I know some stuff.

381
00:24:06,706 --> 00:24:06,808
Rym: well.

382
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:11,590
Scott: So and I know that they have no they never came into play in the actual cartoon.

383
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:18,050
Rym: So our ponies other way around they do and both worlds exist side by side and there's some back-and-forth stuff going on.

384
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:20,230
Scott: But anyway, I didn't see any back-and-forth stuff in the show.

385
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:23,910
Rym: You don't need to you do not need to see that garbage, but I digress.

386
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:31,132
Rym: So my little pony and this is about a pretty long run and we haven't talked about it It's still running.

387
00:24:31,153 --> 00:24:36,617
Rym: there's gonna be another season as season six is confirmed for this year All right, and season five just ended.

388
00:24:37,099 --> 00:24:45,410
Rym: so much like we did with adventure time when a show is long running You can't just review it once and be well can't do a final thoughts cuz when's the final thoughts gonna be?

389
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:47,518
Scott: Yeah, I mean, let's do Flintstones final thoughts.

390
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:51,630
Scott: Yeah, I mean, it's like yeah this thing didn't it's the honeymooners But more family-friendly, right?

391
00:24:51,771 --> 00:24:57,110
Scott: I mean, you know that people don't remember that show ran for a fuck ever right, you know?

392
00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:00,301
Scott: So it's like if we if it was still running we would might not.

393
00:25:00,682 --> 00:25:02,830
Scott: you know, when can you do a final thoughts on it?

394
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:06,165
Scott: Yeah, well you get the thoughts on things that are limited like anime 26 now.

395
00:25:06,527 --> 00:25:12,627
Rym: They're like 117 episodes of my little pony friendship of met as magic not as many as fist of the North Star.

396
00:25:12,687 --> 00:25:17,306
Rym: that is a Little over half as many as Sailor Moon's run.

397
00:25:17,507 --> 00:25:27,510
Rym: Yep Sailor a lot happened in Sailor Moon like if I was gonna review Sailor Moon based on season one Very different thoughts from if I've seen s or stars.

398
00:25:29,912 --> 00:25:37,982
Rym: So I still really like my little pony and I actually think like season four especially the recent season five The quite the average quality has been rising from.

399
00:25:38,002 --> 00:25:45,510
Rym: I think the season three kind of had this Deep not deep Pete look drop, but not the best episodes like you could definitely see.

400
00:25:45,731 --> 00:25:52,200
Scott: I agree that the if you average each season's total episodes together that yeah That third season was definitely the weakest season.

401
00:25:52,421 --> 00:25:53,906
Scott: Well, but it still has some good stuff in it.

402
00:25:54,087 --> 00:25:56,296
Scott: I wasn't bad It didn't make you want to stop watching.

403
00:25:56,336 --> 00:26:00,798
Rym: season one was Lauren Fowles like a hundred percent and season two was Lauren Fowles.

404
00:26:00,818 --> 00:26:02,189
Rym: direction is still there.

405
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:10,452
Rym: Yeah season three was when they started having to go off on their own and they made a lot of decisions that made the show a little less Good.

406
00:26:11,135 --> 00:26:11,396
Scott: Hmm.

407
00:26:11,858 --> 00:26:14,870
Rym: It's hard if I had to describe what bothered me about it.

408
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:17,010
Rym: It wasn't that the show got like simpler or anything.

409
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:20,030
Rym: It was more than the in the first two seasons.

410
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:29,495
Rym: What I liked about the show was that they were very careful to release like little bits of information about the world Tangentially like something.

411
00:26:29,515 --> 00:26:34,793
Rym: you'd see something in the foreground or you'd see a character do a thing and it would imply a bunch of stuff Of the world.

412
00:26:35,114 --> 00:26:39,230
Rym: but they wouldn't then zoom the camera on that and try to explain it all with a giant flashback.

413
00:26:40,233 --> 00:26:49,168
Rym: And as the show goes that got on they've really started to say hey you want to know the deal about this let's zoom in on this and do a huge flashback and tell you the story.

414
00:26:49,188 --> 00:26:58,944
Rym: and they also stopped paying attention to the like Rigid idea that the ponies have hooves and can't just hold stuff.

415
00:26:59,244 --> 00:27:07,890
Rym: Hmm because in more recent episodes They increasingly kind of just ignore that and just yeah that ponies holding the cane because well, we just animated it that way.

416
00:27:08,272 --> 00:27:09,219
Rym: Sorry guys.

417
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:09,702
Rym: Mm-hmm.

418
00:27:10,749 --> 00:27:12,136
Scott: Oh Well, but yeah.

419
00:27:12,417 --> 00:27:19,261
Scott: and the more recent seasons the average quality has been going up But you know the I think the variance has increased right?

420
00:27:19,281 --> 00:27:27,524
Scott: there's some episodes in the newest season that are like so so good And there's some that are so so bad like probably some of the worst episodes in the whole show.

421
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:29,370
Rym: the fan pandering is what's doing it?

422
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,478
Scott: Yeah, there was an episode.

423
00:27:30,538 --> 00:27:31,465
Scott: item was the title of it.

424
00:27:31,485 --> 00:27:32,009
Scott: Do you have it there?

425
00:27:32,394 --> 00:27:36,257
Rym: Pulling up the list it was The best episode of this season.

426
00:27:36,438 --> 00:27:37,180
Rym: far and away.

427
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,503
Rym: was rarity investigate.

428
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:40,007
Scott: No, that was the same.

429
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:43,919
Scott: It's tied I think with the moon dancer episode.

430
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:51,688
Rym: I can't believe just because their rarity investigates is so good Yeah, especially because at the end of the oh and his disingenuous smile.

431
00:27:51,949 --> 00:27:57,428
Scott: Yeah But yeah, there was an episode in the newest season that consists of life.

432
00:27:58,513 --> 00:28:00,280
Scott: Right, it consisted of nothing.

433
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,630
Rym: is this episode have its own Wikipedia page?

434
00:28:03,193 --> 00:28:05,344
Scott: Because it's so much fan pandering references.

435
00:28:05,384 --> 00:28:06,469
Scott: They have to explain right?

436
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:12,245
Scott: So the whole episode was nothing but taking the fan in right and making it canon.

437
00:28:12,345 --> 00:28:21,206
Scott: every single thing that the online pony community right like created like all these personalities for characters and relationships between the characters

438
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:22,469
Rym: and names in some cases,

439
00:28:22,509 --> 00:28:29,090
Scott: you know, Doctor who jokes and it was basically like watching tumblr on TV and I was like, oh my god kill it with fire.

440
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,053
Scott: Yeah with fire.

441
00:28:30,113 --> 00:28:39,809
Rym: there is a way to cater to your fans and their theories Without just taking all their bullshit and cramming it into your show.

442
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:49,524
Rym: The ponies just kind of did the opposite of what they should have done in this regard But at the same time I say should have The fans of my little pony loved it.

443
00:28:49,605 --> 00:28:50,510
Rym: as far as I can tell.

444
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:59,916
Scott: I mean if you're the person the kind of person who writes a you know, Sherlock pones fanfic and then suddenly, you know You like that you're really into that.

445
00:28:59,997 --> 00:29:04,030
Scott: and then suddenly it's real and you got acknowledgement from the people who make the pones.

446
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:08,410
Scott: That's like, you know, that's like if you go to some beaver concert and he touches you, right?

447
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:09,633
Rym: Yeah, it's just.

448
00:29:09,734 --> 00:29:13,188
Rym: I liked it more when it was subtle like the show had a lot of cameos of like.

449
00:29:13,349 --> 00:29:20,615
Rym: hey That's obviously a character of a famous person, but they didn't zoom in on it quite like they do With this fan stuff later.

450
00:29:20,655 --> 00:29:25,810
Scott: Yeah, that episode was just so bad, but thankfully they left it out of further episodes.

451
00:29:25,891 --> 00:29:27,629
Scott: They contained it within that one beast.

452
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:31,409
Scott: Yeah I didn't let it leak into the other episodes some of which are quite good.

453
00:29:31,771 --> 00:29:41,179
Rym: What actually the thing that has been most disappointing about the episodes that weren't great is that they had that conceit of well Twilight's too powerful now and we need this plot of.

454
00:29:41,219 --> 00:29:47,869
Rym: let's just take these three characters and send them off on an adventure So we can write a story just about them.

455
00:29:48,110 --> 00:30:01,370
Rym: yeah, which I don't know just from a production standpoint makes sense because I heard of a rumor and an anecdote that Teen Titans go is Apparently really hard to storyboard and put together because every shot is all the characters all the time.

456
00:30:01,871 --> 00:30:09,042
Rym: Like there's a bunch of characters and they're always there always in the shot always doing their thing They're all involved in every plot and the same thing goes.

457
00:30:09,062 --> 00:30:10,490
Scott: you read x-men comics, right?

458
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:18,250
Scott: And when I was a kid I buy an x-men comic and on the cover would be gambit and you'd read that issue And the only x-men who would be in that issue would be like gambit rogue.

459
00:30:18,732 --> 00:30:22,489
Scott: They talked to Professor X once and maybe Wolverine was there because he's in every issue.

460
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:23,171
Rym: Where's beast?

461
00:30:23,212 --> 00:30:30,270
Scott: always working on the sandwich and you'd only see all the x-men at once and like, you know x-men number one.

462
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:33,970
Scott: Here's a shot of them all in the planning room deciding on what to do.

463
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:37,510
Scott: But then they'd only be in this, you know, two-page spread.

464
00:30:37,771 --> 00:30:44,350
Scott: You just see them there and only a few of them would actually you know be talking and directly involved in the plot of that issue.

465
00:30:44,811 --> 00:30:45,614
Scott: Right, you can't.

466
00:30:45,935 --> 00:30:49,427
Scott: you can't write a story with like a hundred characters all actively doing everything all the time.

467
00:30:49,607 --> 00:30:53,410
Rym: Yep Pretty hit or miss though how well they did this, right?

468
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:55,709
Rym: Well, I didn't use it as often I expected them to.

469
00:30:55,729 --> 00:31:02,715
Scott: well the thing I liked about it was that you brought back to the thing that made me like the first season so much which is The fantasy adventure.

470
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:06,729
Scott: It's like there's a magical table that tells you where to go on a magical quest.

471
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:11,750
Scott: Yeah, there's all these magical questions about elements of harmony and stuff that were you know.

472
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:16,510
Scott: It's like the real reason to watch the show is for epic fantasy stuff and they brought that back.

473
00:31:16,871 --> 00:31:25,099
Scott: but occasionally it's like the table tells up only Applejack and and Pinkie Pie should be going this way.

474
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:27,390
Scott: No, no one else can go on this quest.

475
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:31,818
Rym: yeah, which Could make sense like you could make like.

476
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:37,450
Scott: oh if the rest of them went then like the table knows who needs to go to Solve the problem if anyone else went the problem wouldn't be solved.

477
00:31:37,952 --> 00:31:44,497
Rym: Okay, if the table itself became a plot point Allah quantum leap Mm-hmm, but it doesn't.

478
00:31:44,538 --> 00:31:45,240
Scott: I think it will.

479
00:31:45,261 --> 00:31:46,626
Rym: I don't think it will.

480
00:31:46,646 --> 00:31:47,349
Scott: I think it will.

481
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:58,098
Scott: Well, I guess it's more than the table every although all of the previous table equivalents in the show were plot points Such as writing letters to the princess and such.

482
00:31:58,459 --> 00:32:16,421
Rym: but the plot points in the first few seasons were much more Subtle or much more Open-ended and these plot points that have been introduced increasingly as the show goes on Become very little literal and direct and are spotlighted and solve a specific problem Immediately and are fully explained at some point.

483
00:32:16,481 --> 00:32:18,750
Rym: Yeah, which is kind of boring sometimes.

484
00:32:18,971 --> 00:32:23,910
Scott: Another thing I like is that because the show is sort of expanded the ponies are like getting around, right?

485
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:24,311
Scott: It's not.

486
00:32:24,352 --> 00:32:25,396
Scott: it's not just Ponyville.

487
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:27,163
Scott: It's like we're going to Canada.

488
00:32:27,183 --> 00:32:33,365
Rym: We're going to you know, Clowsdale Griffin town and it turns out all Griffins are just like horrible people.

489
00:32:33,426 --> 00:32:34,550
Scott: We're just going to Manhattan.

490
00:32:34,751 --> 00:32:36,766
Scott: We're going on a quest into the scary place.

491
00:32:37,027 --> 00:32:38,453
Scott: You know the Manhattan.

492
00:32:38,473 --> 00:32:39,478
Rym: they're going back and forth.

493
00:32:39,498 --> 00:32:39,980
Scott: We're riding.

494
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,528
Scott: We're riding that train all the time.

495
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,014
Scott: Yeah, I think I hadn't.

496
00:32:43,035 --> 00:32:47,879
Rym: kind of often and like coming and going and doing so like where you opens a business there We're super important ponies.

497
00:32:47,959 --> 00:32:49,650
Scott: We got to go around Equestria doing stuff.

498
00:32:49,691 --> 00:32:51,129
Scott: We can't just be sitting Ponyville all day.

499
00:32:51,290 --> 00:33:02,427
Rym: But I like that aspect that like rarity like tries to open a shop there and the resolution is kind of like yeah Shop still there like stuff happens like she's she'll live there for a week in an apartment doing something like it's.

500
00:33:02,508 --> 00:33:06,983
Rym: it's more like a Real show that has a bunch of stuff going on like Seinfeld.

501
00:33:07,003 --> 00:33:08,910
Rym: They're going places and doing things.

502
00:33:10,112 --> 00:33:11,659
Rym: Um, I mean, I still like the show a lot.

503
00:33:12,222 --> 00:33:13,127
Scott: Yeah, it's still good.

504
00:33:13,288 --> 00:33:16,840
Scott: Yeah But yeah, so the let's just talk about the really good episode.

505
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,910
Scott: So the Moondancer episode right Harkins back.

506
00:33:20,011 --> 00:33:24,456
Scott: It takes a reference from the very first episode Some Simpsons quality.

507
00:33:24,497 --> 00:33:28,350
Scott: back reference is a part in the first episode of the whole show season one.

508
00:33:28,491 --> 00:33:29,796
Rym: What about Moondancers party?

509
00:33:29,917 --> 00:33:33,693
Scott: right spike is like hey, you know Moondancers having a party Do you want to go?

510
00:33:33,714 --> 00:33:35,121
Scott: and so I was like no I'm busy.

511
00:33:35,141 --> 00:33:42,330
Scott: and then twice, you know They even make a note in that first episode that spike about Moondancer a present that never got delivered or anything.

512
00:33:42,551 --> 00:33:46,644
Scott: Yeah, and in this Moondancer episode basically Twilight remembers that.

513
00:33:46,885 --> 00:33:53,830
Scott: you know that for that Had friends before Ponyville sort of she had friends, but she was super close.

514
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:56,826
Scott: He wasn't close to them because she was just studying and she realized she's the.

515
00:33:56,967 --> 00:34:03,182
Scott: you know He's the princess of friendship and she really used to really suck at friends Which is part of why she became the princess of friendship.

516
00:34:03,745 --> 00:34:04,570
Scott: So she goes back.

517
00:34:04,811 --> 00:34:07,766
Scott: It's like her old counterlot house, which I guess she just abandoned.

518
00:34:07,786 --> 00:34:08,590
Scott: who was paying for it?

519
00:34:08,771 --> 00:34:12,630
Scott: I guess it was princess territory like it's federal territory part.

520
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:19,481
Scott: It's part of the palace and like no one had ever bothered to go there or clean it up or look at it since the first Episode where she just ran out and got in a balloon.

521
00:34:19,501 --> 00:34:24,750
Rym: Well because she was special I remember she was elevated that position because the dragon thing works usually.

522
00:34:24,911 --> 00:34:28,248
Scott: Yeah, it's like if I just if I just leave my house and don't come back someone's gonna go in.

523
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:32,909
Scott: Maybe but everything's still there including the president for Moondancer and everything.

524
00:34:33,752 --> 00:34:37,268
Scott: And then the episode is all about like who is Moondancer and you know.

525
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,775
Rym: Oh There's a problem with that episode.

526
00:34:39,795 --> 00:34:41,400
Rym: that happened in a couple other episodes to.

527
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,605
Rym: that bothers me a little bit.

528
00:34:42,665 --> 00:34:44,330
Rym: that a lot of times.

529
00:34:44,512 --> 00:34:50,123
Rym: Yeah, there was that one flaw with the episode Solution to the prop through the problems of a person.

530
00:34:50,143 --> 00:34:54,399
Rym: Well, I guess a pony Tend to be really simplistic.

531
00:34:54,498 --> 00:35:06,064
Rym: Yeah and tend to have kind of a bad message for like a kid who might be watching the show because a lot of moon dancers episode was basically She became an introverted shut-in because of that incident.

532
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:06,907
Scott: and that's not true.

533
00:35:06,968 --> 00:35:07,570
Scott: There's no way.

534
00:35:07,771 --> 00:35:10,210
Scott: Yeah, it one incident is gonna make someone like that.

535
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:15,610
Rym: It would have been a lot better if the gift and that if she is just an introvert and that's fine.

536
00:35:15,731 --> 00:35:17,669
Rym: And they resolved it a much more subtle way.

537
00:35:18,551 --> 00:35:24,662
Rym: but on the other hand with some of the Fluttershy episodes They did that really well because I thought the scary Halloween one.

538
00:35:24,682 --> 00:35:25,123
Scott: Yeah.

539
00:35:25,224 --> 00:35:25,866
Rym: Oh my god.

540
00:35:25,927 --> 00:35:26,750
Rym: She's so bad.

541
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:31,422
Scott: That's probably that's right underneath those other two of those those animals that she made.

542
00:35:31,442 --> 00:35:32,444
Scott: Oh my god.

543
00:35:32,465 --> 00:35:35,276
Rym: I Love how she's.

544
00:35:35,317 --> 00:35:36,589
Rym: you know that she's totally a weeb.

545
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:38,055
Rym: Well, I like I like that also.

546
00:35:38,115 --> 00:35:38,677
Scott: is they how they?

547
00:35:38,818 --> 00:35:42,676
Scott: they sort of giving you a some sense of time and that they're reselebrating All the holidays.

548
00:35:42,717 --> 00:35:44,069
Scott: there was another grand galloping gala.

549
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:46,643
Scott: There was another, you know all spooky Eve.

550
00:35:46,663 --> 00:35:48,070
Scott: There was another heart swarming, right?

551
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:51,370
Scott: It's like another year has gone through, you know, the seasons changing it.

552
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:52,575
Scott: They didn't do another winter wrap-up.

553
00:35:52,615 --> 00:35:52,977
Scott: they should.

554
00:35:53,118 --> 00:35:54,785
Rym: but I look at the moral of that episode.

555
00:35:54,845 --> 00:35:55,850
Rym: was Fluttershy.

556
00:35:56,111 --> 00:36:00,105
Rym: It's totally okay that she's not good at or into something like fine.

557
00:36:00,386 --> 00:36:01,390
Rym: Cool the end.

558
00:36:01,711 --> 00:36:04,479
Rym: They didn't fix her and make her love the holiday.

559
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,790
Scott: She just did her own thing, but they did show her being awesome at it.

560
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:16,440
Rym: Yeah, they did the same thing with Fluttershy in the the one with her singing Mmm with the lip-syncing thing and now she got really into it.

561
00:36:16,862 --> 00:36:19,815
Rym: and then the moral at the end wasn't oh now she's over Her stage fright.

562
00:36:19,855 --> 00:36:25,219
Rym: it was yeah, she's still into singing But she still has stage fright and that's cool.

563
00:36:25,941 --> 00:36:27,466
Rym: and I feel like half the episode.

564
00:36:27,486 --> 00:36:28,670
Scott: wonder she became a model.

565
00:36:28,992 --> 00:36:31,690
Scott: Yeah, I was like, I don't want to be a model anymore even though I was famous.

566
00:36:31,891 --> 00:36:40,310
Rym: But half the episodes of the new seasons have a good complex or at least nuanced moral like that Harrison Bergeron episode.

567
00:36:40,772 --> 00:36:45,510
Scott: Yeah, you didn't see the final episode of the season where the Harrison Bergeron pony comes back.

568
00:36:45,611 --> 00:36:46,778
Rym: I didn't know she was gonna come back.

569
00:36:46,899 --> 00:36:49,757
Scott: I didn't know either cuz they were talking about someone I'm like, who are they talking about?

570
00:36:49,778 --> 00:36:54,609
Rym: I'm like, oh the Harrison Bergeron pony Is it done well and have a nuanced point or is it?

571
00:36:54,669 --> 00:37:01,439
Rym: well It's a little bit Little bit simplistic again.

572
00:37:01,459 --> 00:37:17,029
Rym: No, I mean it's okay Alright But see that's the quality of individual episodes has been kind of inconsistent and it's getting I think more swingy But at the same time the average quality is still slowly increasing again.

573
00:37:17,411 --> 00:37:21,790
Rym: Hmm just nothing's quite as good as that season two season one.

574
00:37:22,151 --> 00:37:25,728
Rym: Yeah season one season two had a lot of good stuff going on there.

575
00:37:25,768 --> 00:37:26,050
Scott: Why not?

576
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:28,559
Scott: You know didn't have a rainbow thing.

577
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:31,270
Rym: No, but it did have that hearts and hopes day episode.

578
00:37:32,572 --> 00:37:35,988
Rym: Also Dragon Quest was season two really.

579
00:37:36,049 --> 00:37:41,386
Scott: no Oh Dragon Quest is the one where there's a bunch that spike goes to sparkle crackle.

580
00:37:41,486 --> 00:37:42,710
Scott: Yes, that's Dragon Quest.

581
00:37:42,831 --> 00:37:50,708
Scott: Yes, that was a good episode sure But no the good dragon episode was season one Which is the one with Fluttershy going up the mountain and talking to the dragon.

582
00:37:50,728 --> 00:37:58,510
Rym: Yep Yep, so pretty much if you've been ignoring cuz you know There's a lot of cartoons that you can watch right now that are probably better than ponies actually.

583
00:37:58,731 --> 00:38:09,813
Rym: But like the wide set like all the stuff that I watch and I kind of go through phases like I didn't watch a lot Of ponies for a while because I was watching a whole bunch of gumball and Steven Universe and Adventure Time and I sort of rotate In and out.

584
00:38:10,315 --> 00:38:17,543
Rym: so if you're rotated ponies out because you're watching all this other stuff It's actually a pretty good time to rotate it back in one punch man is done.
