00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,032
Scott: It's Monday November 7th, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:13,072 --> 00:00:15,760
Scott: We'll be discussing window managers and some other crap.

3
00:00:17,461 --> 00:00:17,902
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:18,063 --> 00:00:18,504
Scott: Hahaha.

5
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:20,029
Rym: Let's do this.

6
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:21,092
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:21,814 --> 00:00:26,829
Scott: All right, so Paris is still burning When it's not burning like in the old.

8
00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:27,070
Scott: now.

9
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,598
Rym: the picture on the news right now shows something burning.

10
00:00:29,778 --> 00:00:33,799
Scott: Yeah, okay So there it's not burning down like when they'll burn the whole thing down.

11
00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:36,996
Scott: now There's no Bastille going down, but I mean people are burning.

12
00:00:37,016 --> 00:00:39,346
Scott: a lot of cars Houses.

13
00:00:39,366 --> 00:00:40,659
Rym: yeah, they finally killed someone.

14
00:00:41,465 --> 00:00:43,257
Scott: Okay, they got one guy great.

15
00:00:44,162 --> 00:00:47,652
Rym: Though apparently the only real news now is that the police got someone.

16
00:00:48,374 --> 00:00:50,139
Rym: no no some kids killed an old man.

17
00:00:51,861 --> 00:00:53,849
Rym: They beat him up while he was trying to put out a trash fire.

18
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,880
Scott: I thought the police finally killed one rioter.

19
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,126
Rym: No, they've arrested thousands.

20
00:00:58,187 --> 00:00:59,413
Rym: It's not doing okay.

21
00:00:59,433 --> 00:01:00,639
Scott: They have a jail that big.

22
00:01:01,262 --> 00:01:01,965
Scott: I don't know what they're doing.

23
00:01:01,985 --> 00:01:03,591
Scott: They reopen the Bastille.

24
00:01:03,892 --> 00:01:05,820
Rym: the news isn't so informative.

25
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,999
Rym: The only real news is that the rioting is spread to Belgium and apparently some German suburbs now, too.

26
00:01:11,941 --> 00:01:15,334
Scott: I don't think it's that widespread there because I was listening to another podcast.

27
00:01:15,355 --> 00:01:16,720
Scott: the guys in Belgium today?

28
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,836
Rym: Oh, no, it's not because both of those countries reacted immediately.

29
00:01:19,856 --> 00:01:25,552
Scott: No, okay Yeah rioting Poor people.

30
00:01:25,897 --> 00:01:26,984
Rym: yeah I mean everyone's.

31
00:01:27,064 --> 00:01:34,856
Rym: a lot of people in the news are trying to blame this on the Muslims who are rioting in the North Africans are a rioting, but the only common threat is that they're all poor.

32
00:01:34,876 --> 00:01:36,964
Scott: if you're poor You don't have a job.

33
00:01:37,246 --> 00:01:39,114
Scott: you got nothing to do you got no money.

34
00:01:39,798 --> 00:01:43,478
Rym: You're right Or you do something else.

35
00:01:44,921 --> 00:01:49,616
Scott: So worse almost as bad as rioters is SEO, so what do they do now?

36
00:01:49,636 --> 00:01:50,057
Scott: so SEO?

37
00:01:51,844 --> 00:02:05,339
Scott: Has demanded from IBM Information about Linux kernel version Because that exists.

38
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,868
Scott: That's the story.

39
00:02:07,888 --> 00:02:10,461
Rym: I Want 2.7.

40
00:02:10,461 --> 00:02:11,963
Rym: I want that information now, too.

41
00:02:12,344 --> 00:02:13,546
Scott: Well it so far.

42
00:02:13,626 --> 00:02:14,967
Scott: They've discussed it.

43
00:02:16,029 --> 00:02:20,711
Scott: on the mailing list There isn't I don't think a single line of code in it.

44
00:02:21,314 --> 00:02:23,602
Scott: There's no 2.7.

45
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:24,987
Scott: There's a theoretical 2.7.

46
00:02:24,987 --> 00:02:32,820
Rym: There's a three or a theoretical 9. yep You know I'd love to be there physically at the trial.

47
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:41,265
Rym: well I could see SEO standing there And they've made their claim and they know they say what they want and then the IBM guy stands up and says That doesn't exist.

48
00:02:41,647 --> 00:02:49,919
Rym: you might all have asked me for the flying spaghetti monsters newly appendage But the flying one the spaghetti monster is real damn straight.

49
00:02:51,233 --> 00:02:55,550
Rym: Uh Yeah, though that stupid intelligent design trial is over.

50
00:02:56,072 --> 00:02:56,573
Rym: It's over.

51
00:02:56,974 --> 00:02:57,697
Rym: It's over.

52
00:02:57,717 --> 00:02:59,884
Scott: Well if it's over How can the judge hasn't said anything?

53
00:02:59,924 --> 00:03:04,260
Rym: now the judge is sitting in his room thinking about whether he's gonna side with science or crazy.

54
00:03:04,963 --> 00:03:06,569
Scott: How what takes him so long to think?

55
00:03:06,649 --> 00:03:06,991
Scott: okay?

56
00:03:07,352 --> 00:03:09,300
Scott: You're judges you've heard everything.

57
00:03:09,724 --> 00:03:10,898
Scott: There's nothing new to hear.

58
00:03:11,401 --> 00:03:17,103
Rym: Maybe he only works like Monday through Friday, so we had the weekend off and now he's gonna make his decision today And he'll say it tomorrow.

59
00:03:17,766 --> 00:03:18,388
Scott: Ah it was.

60
00:03:18,689 --> 00:03:21,360
Scott: oh, so he's gonna say it on a different day, then he comes up with it.

61
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:21,902
Rym: I don't know.

62
00:03:21,922 --> 00:03:22,847
Rym: I don't know how that works.

63
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,880
Scott: I think he's a lazy judge trying to get a little vacation.

64
00:03:26,521 --> 00:03:32,120
Rym: Yeah, the only funny thing that came out of it was that the Vatican came out and said that ideas crap.

65
00:03:32,302 --> 00:03:33,211
Scott: I don't know if that was just one.

66
00:03:33,635 --> 00:03:36,729
Scott: no I don't know if that was the Vatican or just a guy.

67
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:39,840
Rym: is the official position of the Vatican unless the Pope says otherwise?

68
00:03:40,522 --> 00:03:42,042
Scott: Yeah But me all.

69
00:03:42,062 --> 00:03:42,725
Scott: there's a story about it.

70
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:44,290
Scott: on slash that I scrolled down.

71
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:49,869
Scott: yeah, and there was one guy who was like You know I'm an ID proponent whatever.

72
00:03:49,969 --> 00:03:51,354
Scott: everyone else is just like science.

73
00:03:51,394 --> 00:03:52,959
Scott: woot right uh-huh.

74
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,408
Scott: But even that guy didn't know what ID.

75
00:03:55,508 --> 00:03:58,539
Scott: he didn't know what ID was and he was a proponent of it.

76
00:04:01,828 --> 00:04:06,290
Scott: So yeah Yeah, yeah, of course some people are that way about Darwinism.

77
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,537
Scott: all are also her opponents of it.

78
00:04:08,557 --> 00:04:09,340
Scott: They don't know what it is.

79
00:04:10,941 --> 00:04:13,320
Rym: People tend to be opponents of things that they don't really understand.

80
00:04:13,883 --> 00:04:14,890
Scott: It's gonna think they understand.

81
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,238
Scott: I mean they're proponents of what they think.

82
00:04:16,801 --> 00:04:18,166
Scott: Anyone's a proponent of what they think.

83
00:04:18,245 --> 00:04:20,172
Rym: yeah, cuz I'm very much a fan of.

84
00:04:20,233 --> 00:04:20,915

00:04:21,055 --> 00:04:22,379
Scott: ice you think wrong.

86
00:04:24,442 --> 00:04:24,924
Scott: Who is that?

87
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:25,749
Rym: I don't know.

88
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:26,533
Scott: that's good.

89
00:04:26,553 --> 00:04:32,545
Scott: that means you don't have to Pay attention, it's someone local.

90
00:04:32,565 --> 00:04:33,486
Rym: I have no idea who it is.

91
00:04:33,547 --> 00:04:35,649
Scott: I'll just yeah screw it.

92
00:04:36,551 --> 00:04:39,220
Scott: Anyway, we'll have to cut that out or something.

93
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,303
Scott: leave it doesn't matter.

94
00:04:41,106 --> 00:04:42,450
Scott: so that guy was on death row.

Rym: Okay, so a guy was on death row.

96
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:44,623
Rym: What do you do?

97
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:45,167
Scott: He escaped?

98
00:04:45,469 --> 00:04:45,550
Rym: No?

99
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,219
Rym: No, I mean, what did he do to get on death row?

100
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,125
Scott: I don't know.

101
00:04:48,185 --> 00:04:48,930
Scott: I didn't read that part.

102
00:04:49,452 --> 00:04:51,080
Rym: I mean is this a real murder?

103
00:04:51,121 --> 00:04:51,603
Rym: ten kids.

104
00:04:51,704 --> 00:04:52,306
Scott: Oh, yeah, he was.

105
00:04:52,347 --> 00:04:55,395
Scott: he was a bad guy Anyway, but he escaped.

106
00:04:56,137 --> 00:05:01,681
Scott: they thought that they're like someone helped him escape like this anti death row group But they they were acquitted.

107
00:05:01,742 --> 00:05:02,609
Scott: they didn't do anything.

108
00:05:02,891 --> 00:05:06,505
Scott: Uh-huh this guy just like I think he walked out like in.

109
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:08,828
Scott: I don't know how he got out But anyway, he was on the run.

110
00:05:09,432 --> 00:05:15,226
Scott: So they made a huge manhunt of course, which is they should do yeah, and They got him.

111
00:05:16,336 --> 00:05:18,110
Scott: He was drunk in a phone booth.

112
00:05:19,354 --> 00:05:27,150
Scott: awesome Cuz you know when I escaped from prison, I'm gonna get drunk and hang out in phone booth where I won't get caught.

113
00:05:27,673 --> 00:05:30,358
Rym: Yeah, yeah, I mean I would have gone one step To go.

114
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:36,599
Rym: You know, hey escaped Serial killer looking for some.

115
00:05:37,201 --> 00:05:39,629
Rym: I don't know whatever escaped serial killers are looking for.

116
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:43,209
Scott: I just go to freakin Mexico or something where they couldn't get me.

117
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:47,128
Scott: I wouldn't hang around and get drunk in the country that are running away from huh?

118
00:05:48,171 --> 00:05:49,778
Rym: Obviously, let me put it this way.

119
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,324
Rym: He's on death row.

120
00:05:51,364 --> 00:05:52,670
Rym: So whatever he did he got caught.

121
00:05:53,952 --> 00:05:57,569
Rym: If you're not smart enough to avoid the police, you're probably not smart enough to avoid them again.

122
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:07,689
Rym: Yeah I could have run to Somalia Where the pirates are where the pirates are and we're apparently the reason there's pirates because there's no government at all.

123
00:06:08,753 --> 00:06:09,837
Scott: There was a government.

124
00:06:09,857 --> 00:06:14,055
Rym: There hasn't been a government in Somalia for a fairly long time So it's just anarchy.

125
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:20,890
Rym: pretty much ever since the ruling party was deposed There's really no consensus as to what the actual government of the country is.

126
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,939
Scott: So why don't we just go there and do something?

127
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:24,546
Rym: because the country's split into these five.

128
00:06:24,586 --> 00:06:25,389
Scott: don't talk about you and me.

129
00:06:26,231 --> 00:06:31,390
Rym: The country's fell into these five like fiefdoms and they're run by these warlords and each have their own army.

130
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,557
Scott: Okay, so this there is someone in charge.

131
00:06:33,598 --> 00:06:34,260
Rym: Yeah, but there's no.

132
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,090
Scott: can't just go in and set up our own warlordness.

133
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:41,044
Rym: Yeah, Somalia is just a bunch of little like bickering countries now.

134
00:06:41,064 --> 00:06:41,687
Scott: All right.

135
00:06:41,807 --> 00:06:42,409
Scott: What are you gonna do?

136
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:45,419
Rym: So after this whole pirate attack the u.s.

137
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:50,397
Rym: Said hey clean up your act in Somalia said We're a bunch of warlords.

138
00:06:50,417 --> 00:06:51,121
Scott: What are you gonna do?

139
00:06:51,805 --> 00:06:52,589
Rym: We don't have ships.

140
00:06:53,991 --> 00:06:55,075
Scott: Okay, we'll pirate you.

141
00:06:55,116 --> 00:06:57,465
Rym: if you come to help us you can clear out the pirates.

142
00:06:57,485 --> 00:06:58,128
Rym: we won't stop you.

143
00:06:58,269 --> 00:06:59,974
Scott: yeah Pirates.

144
00:07:00,216 --> 00:07:01,930
Rym: now, I wouldn't have even brought up the pirate attack.

145
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:06,449
Rym: I mean it that happens all the time is not that big a deal, but that's the captain was awesome.

146
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:10,450
Rym: This is probably the most interesting pirate attack in the last couple years.

147
00:07:11,671 --> 00:07:13,177
Scott: Now there's some interesting pirate attacks.

148
00:07:13,358 --> 00:07:14,824
Rym: Yeah, this one was pretty interesting.

149
00:07:14,904 --> 00:07:16,270
Scott: I mean the thing is it is a cruise ship.

150
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,157
Scott: It wasn't like a boat full of stuff.

151
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:18,659
Rym: Yep.

152
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:22,576
Rym: It was a cruise ship and the pirates had RPGs.

153
00:07:22,678 --> 00:07:27,125
Rym: they always have RPGs Yeah, and they fired a whole bunch of them at the cruise ship and they always do that.

154
00:07:27,185 --> 00:07:28,210
Scott: that that's not the part.

155
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,740
Rym: That's they really only succeeded in breaking a few windows.

156
00:07:31,182 --> 00:07:33,170
Scott: Well, no, they blew up one cabin, but no one was in it.

157
00:07:33,351 --> 00:07:34,437
Rym: No, one person was in it.

158
00:07:34,477 --> 00:07:35,342
Rym: She was taking a bath.

159
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:36,830
Rym: So she didn't get hit by the shrapnel.

160
00:07:37,092 --> 00:07:37,940
Scott: That's not what I read.

161
00:07:37,961 --> 00:07:38,748
Rym: That's what I read.

162
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:40,868
Scott: conflicting story.

163
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:42,845
Rym: In fact, I'm looking at that story right now.

164
00:07:44,294 --> 00:07:44,970
Rym: There's another guy.

165
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:51,101
Rym: he's a World War two veteran and he was trying to take a picture of one of the pirates and Quote the man with the bazooka.

166
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,989
Rym: aimed it right at me and I saw a big flash.

167
00:07:54,411 --> 00:08:00,390
Rym: Needless to say I dropped the camera and dived the grenade struck two decks above in about four rooms further forward.

168
00:08:01,175 --> 00:08:05,463
Rym: I could tell the guy firing the bazooka was smiling Great.

169
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:06,872
Rym: Apparently.

170
00:08:06,933 --> 00:08:13,530
Rym: the captain of the cruise ship tried to ram the pirates a couple times Yep, and he totally ran away with his ultra fast cruise ship.

171
00:08:13,691 --> 00:08:16,203
Rym: Yep, there was some quote where the captain says something to the effect of.

172
00:08:16,243 --> 00:08:17,690
Rym: I didn't know this thing could go that fast.

173
00:08:18,112 --> 00:08:21,090
Scott: Yeah, but the stories I read didn't have passengers doing stuff.

174
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:26,449
Scott: it was like all the passengers were shoved into the center of the ship and the captain got everyone off the deck.

175
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:29,339
Scott: and You know, no one got hurt.

176
00:08:29,721 --> 00:08:29,942
Rym: Yep.

177
00:08:29,982 --> 00:08:30,565
Rym: No one got hurt.

178
00:08:30,585 --> 00:08:31,550
Rym: They all got good stories.

179
00:08:31,691 --> 00:08:33,578
Rym: I imagine they all get refunds or something.

180
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,049
Scott: Well, I can imagine they're gonna finish their cruise first.

181
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:39,159
Rym: Yeah, well the ship was kind of RPG.

182
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:40,525
Rym: I think they have to put him on a different ship.

183
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:41,650
Scott: No, it still works.

184
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:43,900
Scott: Boats very hard to sink.

185
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:49,015
Scott: a boat, you know, yeah Titanic it's sunk when it hit this iceberg.

186
00:08:49,336 --> 00:08:50,920
Scott: It's so hard to do.

187
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,804
Scott: the iceberg was so big.

188
00:08:52,984 --> 00:08:53,786
Scott: Oh my god.

189
00:08:53,806 --> 00:08:58,550
Scott: I Mean, you know, you're like oil like spills here.

190
00:08:58,570 --> 00:08:59,757
Rym: It is quote my quote.

191
00:08:59,898 --> 00:09:03,235
Rym: a woman survived an explosion in her stateroom Simply because she was taken to Bath.

192
00:09:03,275 --> 00:09:03,697
Rym: at the time.

193
00:09:04,119 --> 00:09:06,870
Rym: others flung themselves to the floor to avoid bullets that were zipping through the ship.

194
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:10,130
Rym: They were only gathered after the pirates attacked the store.

195
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:14,103
Scott: The story I read was like an RPG hit the boat and exploded in.

196
00:09:14,164 --> 00:09:15,769
Scott: it blew up a cabin but no one was in it.

197
00:09:16,271 --> 00:09:17,555
Rym: Well, there was a woman in that cabin.

198
00:09:18,117 --> 00:09:19,280
Scott: Oh, maybe it was a different cabin.

199
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,424
Scott: two different RPGs.

200
00:09:20,444 --> 00:09:20,785
Scott: Who knows?

201
00:09:21,226 --> 00:09:21,447
Rym: Yeah.

202
00:09:21,568 --> 00:09:26,973
Rym: Yeah so Some other down today Rocksters gone.

203
00:09:27,635 --> 00:09:28,898
Scott: They were gone before now.

204
00:09:28,918 --> 00:09:29,780
Rym: They're actually gone.

205
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,688
Rym: They had to pay 50 million and they're out of business.

206
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:36,639
Scott: All right One more p2p Network.

207
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:37,201
Scott: that's gone.

208
00:09:37,362 --> 00:09:37,664
Rym: Luckily.

209
00:09:37,684 --> 00:09:42,840
Rym: We still have the Pirates Bay Unlike the Somalian pirates.

210
00:09:43,463 --> 00:09:52,629
Scott: Yeah, Pirates Bay has a Yeah, yeah It's much better at pirating and it doesn't kill people with RPGs.

211
00:09:53,872 --> 00:09:59,533
Rym: Aha, unless they download Final Fantasy 7, but I'm It's bad.

212
00:09:59,753 --> 00:10:01,338
Rym: that was awesome, yeah, that's bad.

213
00:10:01,578 --> 00:10:02,461
Rym: That was awesome.

214
00:10:02,521 --> 00:10:02,922
Scott: It's bad.

215
00:10:03,163 --> 00:10:10,230
Scott: Well, you know, uh, even though Somalia has no government We have a government.

216
00:10:11,271 --> 00:10:11,894
Rym: Yeah, what about it?

217
00:10:11,934 --> 00:10:12,998
Scott: We vote for it tomorrow.

218
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,210
Scott: Oh, yeah Election Day, but it's just shitty town government.

219
00:10:16,732 --> 00:10:21,450
Rym: See, I really I was excited because I like the town we live in beacon and I wanted to get active.

220
00:10:22,033 --> 00:10:31,110
Rym: but I read the proposals of the two sides and It's all either FUD or just straight-up BS and neither one of them actually has a blue thing.

221
00:10:31,211 --> 00:10:33,450
Scott: Is those are just like the vote for me pamphlets?

222
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:40,087
Scott: We have to find like the position things which is not easy to find because apparently the town is internet incompetent.

223
00:10:40,488 --> 00:10:42,076
Rym: Yes Mm-hmm.

224
00:10:42,662 --> 00:10:45,850
Rym: So I'm gonna go in and vote But I don't think I'm gonna vote for any people.

225
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:48,240
Rym: I'm only gonna vote on any propositions that may happen to be.

226
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,643
Scott: I'm gonna go in and I'll look at it and you know I'll look and I'll see if there's anything that looks like I want to vote for it.

227
00:10:53,803 --> 00:10:55,430
Scott: I'll click it and everything else.

228
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:56,895
Scott: I just leave it whatever.

229
00:10:56,915 --> 00:10:57,236
Scott: Yeah.

230
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:59,304
Rym: Well, there's supposed to be some town propositions and stuff.

231
00:10:59,444 --> 00:11:07,931
Rym: move and vote for a judge, but There's even a story on park today about how I think less than a quarter of people are gonna vote in this election because no One cares.

232
00:11:08,473 --> 00:11:08,633
Scott: Hmm.

233
00:11:09,275 --> 00:11:10,538
Rym: Nothing's not nothing's at stake.

234
00:11:10,979 --> 00:11:11,180
Scott: Yep.

235
00:11:11,621 --> 00:11:12,984
Scott: It is a school board voting.

236
00:11:13,024 --> 00:11:15,170
Scott: I'll vote for the non-incumbent school board.

237
00:11:16,132 --> 00:11:19,989
Rym: I think I'm gonna vote for a non-incumbent anything forever until things change.

238
00:11:20,732 --> 00:11:22,378
Scott: Yeah, but that won't make things change.

239
00:11:22,539 --> 00:11:23,442
Scott: I don't think it would have.

240
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:24,948
Rym: everyone did but not everyone will.

241
00:11:25,229 --> 00:11:27,217
Scott: yeah Oh, well, what are you gonna do?

242
00:11:28,061 --> 00:11:30,069
Rym: I'm gonna get me a DS and my Wi-Fi.

243
00:11:30,511 --> 00:11:31,416
Scott: We already have a DS.

244
00:11:31,517 --> 00:11:33,750
Scott: It already has Wi-Fi just doesn't have a game to play.

245
00:11:34,091 --> 00:11:35,396
Rym: Yeah, Mario Kart's coming out.

246
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:36,019
Rym: When's it coming out?

247
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:36,702
Scott: the 14th?

248
00:11:37,103 --> 00:11:45,845
Scott: I'm gonna be there ASAP And I'll become the grand master of Mario Kart DS as I was the grand master of Mario Kart.

249
00:11:45,865 --> 00:11:47,009
Rym: GBA will see.

250
00:11:48,631 --> 00:11:50,738
Scott: It's not even like a see it.

251
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:53,970
Scott: It's it's you will see because it will happen.

252
00:11:54,853 --> 00:11:55,317
Scott: It's not.

253
00:11:55,418 --> 00:12:02,350
Rym: it's like there isn't doubt But at least apparently works with every frickin router unless you're using WPA then it won't work.

254
00:12:02,891 --> 00:12:12,949
Scott: yeah, but if you don't have a you know an open wireless or a WEP wireless or a Buffalo AOS s access point you can use.

255
00:12:13,795 --> 00:12:18,708
Scott: You know, you can use the little USB Thingy, yeah the little dongle.

256
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,814
Scott: So like if there's.

257
00:12:19,914 --> 00:12:23,990
Scott: only if the only access around is like a pay t-mobile hotspot.

258
00:12:24,071 --> 00:12:30,610
Scott: Well, the DS can't really use that But your laptop can use that and then you put the USB thing in the laptop and then you're good.

259
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:33,141
Scott: But I don't know if it's Windows only which I'm pretty sure it is.

260
00:12:33,261 --> 00:12:34,065
Rym: That's what I've read.

261
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,230
Rym: It's Windows XP only.

262
00:12:35,934 --> 00:12:37,261
Scott: Oh, that's really kind of Blair.

263
00:12:37,865 --> 00:12:41,076
Scott: I mean at least all Windows is and Mac.

264
00:12:41,477 --> 00:12:45,854
Scott: I mean I can understand if you're not Linux II but you should be Linux II though Yeah, you should.

265
00:12:46,035 --> 00:12:47,541
Scott: hell they should make it like Mac.

266
00:12:47,582 --> 00:12:49,490
Rym: people are real tick that it's not Mac friendly.

267
00:12:49,651 --> 00:12:49,932
Scott: You know what?

268
00:12:49,952 --> 00:12:53,609
Scott: They could have done they could have made it like a Java app to start it up.

269
00:12:54,214 --> 00:12:55,767
Scott: Who who would have thought of that, huh?

270
00:12:56,932 --> 00:13:06,128
Scott: haha Yeah bastards You know now if I'm somewhere where you know, there's no, you know wireless that the DS can actually use them.

271
00:13:06,308 --> 00:13:10,642
Rym: I'm SOL Yeah, but that's fine because I still have a million single-player games to beat.

272
00:13:10,843 --> 00:13:12,470
Scott: Yeah, I'm just not gonna buy the USB thing.

273
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,836
Rym: I don't think we don't need it.

274
00:13:14,359 --> 00:13:15,283
Scott: We don't need it in the house.

275
00:13:15,323 --> 00:13:16,689
Scott: But what if we go somewhere?

276
00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:22,779
Rym: I Imagine places like Otakon and All the other cons we go to here.

277
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:25,090
Scott: What do you do like a hotel and they have pay wireless?

278
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:31,326
Scott: I mean there are actually a couple hotels signed up to have DS access points the same way McDonald's does.

279
00:13:31,587 --> 00:13:36,035
Scott: I think it was like participating Region sees or something like that.

280
00:13:36,055 --> 00:13:42,281
Scott: I didn't I don't remember but you know, what if I go to like, you know Marriott was not one of the ones listed.

281
00:13:42,924 --> 00:13:43,790
Rym: We wouldn't pay for that.

282
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:47,381
Rym: Anyway, I mean at the Renaissance where we stay for Otakon every year.

283
00:13:47,421 --> 00:13:50,550
Rym: It's like 10 bucks a day to get access.

284
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:51,896
Scott: I can't believe they charge.

285
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:55,070
Scott: Oh my god business travelers pay it so dumb.

286
00:13:55,632 --> 00:13:57,780
Rym: No, I'm a company.

287
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,406
Scott: what if I go somewhere in a business trip?

288
00:13:59,426 --> 00:14:00,530
Scott: my company picks up the tab.

289
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,295
Scott: How am I need to?

290
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:03,510

00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,090
Scott: Yeah, most of Connecticut is a suburb.

296
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,076
Scott: In fact, the whole state is pretty much a suburb.

297
00:14:20,337 --> 00:14:27,255
Scott: Haha, except for like two cities and a nuclear submarine factory The rest of its suburb all of it.

Rym: I had to show him the badgers.

320
00:15:49,011 --> 00:15:50,917
Scott: There was a guy I heard in a podcast today.

321
00:15:50,997 --> 00:15:53,926
Scott: It seemed like to me like he just discovered the Numa Numa dance.

322
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:57,010
Rym: Oh The Numa Numa dance is a Star Wars.

323
00:16:00,871 --> 00:16:04,561
Scott: Yeah Yeah Star Wars kid and I think that's just.

324
00:16:04,762 --> 00:16:10,806
Scott: you know, I can't think of any other ones but This website was just loaded with all that stuff and you bring it back home.

325
00:16:10,826 --> 00:16:11,750
Scott: star was on there.

326
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:14,861
Rym: Yeah, home stars still going but I don't watch it anymore.

327
00:16:14,882 --> 00:16:19,577
Scott: It was real good in the day But I just kind of lost interest.

328
00:16:19,617 --> 00:16:22,789
Scott: I imagine it's still the same but it's just more of the same.

329
00:16:23,272 --> 00:16:25,989
Rym: No, cuz remember the good old days before the gimmicks.

330
00:16:26,772 --> 00:16:31,104
Scott: You know, I'm 75% sure that my email was the gimmick email.

331
00:16:31,706 --> 00:16:32,006
Rym: Yeah.

332
00:16:32,167 --> 00:16:33,290
Scott: Yeah, I have it somewhere.

333
00:16:33,651 --> 00:16:34,675
Rym: How'd you claim to fame here?

334
00:16:34,695 --> 00:16:40,790
Scott: Of course, I think they changed, you know my name on it and stuff Whatever.

335
00:16:41,856 --> 00:16:42,587
Scott: You see anything cool?

336
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:51,559
Rym: Actually, there's something weird out of Korea because everything weird that happened comes out of Korea Nowadays, yeah, but it isn't you isn't the usual stuff.

337
00:16:51,579 --> 00:16:55,170
Rym: It isn't like kid dies playing video games or crazy moon water.

338
00:16:55,835 --> 00:16:59,798
Rym: It's this eight-year-old who's going to university And it happens all the time.

339
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:05,250
Rym: Yeah song you win Wants to build flying cars and all this other stuff, apparently.

340
00:17:05,376 --> 00:17:09,345
Scott: Yeah I remember when I was in second grade and they were like, what's it gonna be like in the year 2000?

341
00:17:09,345 --> 00:17:15,263
Scott: and everyone was like Flying cars and I made a flying car to construct but it's year 2005.

342
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,230
Scott: There's no fucking flying cars.

343
00:17:17,431 --> 00:17:24,380
Rym: the thing is the article isn't real informative and As I read it it looks there's no like.

344
00:17:24,521 --> 00:17:32,050
Rym: oh you scored this well on this test or blah blah blah and There's a chance that this is some sort of crazy publicity stunt could be a crazy publicity stunt.

345
00:17:32,492 --> 00:17:36,430
Rym: It was just a slow day on the internets and this was the coolest thing I saw.

346
00:17:37,371 --> 00:17:42,730
Scott: Hmm, you know, I think if we actually educated kids properly though that they would be that smart at that age.

347
00:17:43,052 --> 00:17:45,729
Scott: Yeah, or at least you know the ones that were smart.

348
00:17:46,631 --> 00:17:53,636
Rym: I mean, I remember in fifth grade or no God for fourth or fifth grade one of those two years They had a little pilot program.

349
00:17:53,657 --> 00:17:55,162
Rym: You can stay after school and they teach algebra.

350
00:17:55,684 --> 00:17:55,905
Scott: Yep.

351
00:17:55,966 --> 00:18:00,799
Scott: I did that in fifth grade and We learned algebra and we learned that.

352
00:18:00,819 --> 00:18:02,023
Rym: Oh, it's really easy.

353
00:18:02,284 --> 00:18:03,548
Rym: Why didn't you teach us this sooner?

354
00:18:03,809 --> 00:18:10,170
Scott: Yep I remember in first grade they gave us like math problems where there'd be a box and the box might be on the other side.

355
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:10,732
Scott: It'd be equal.

356
00:18:11,294 --> 00:18:18,120
Scott: Oh, you might have you fill in the box and then later when they showed me algebra I was like, I could have done this in freaking first grade.

357
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,910
Scott: I've been bored in math class for five years.

358
00:18:21,294 --> 00:18:22,810
Scott: Why did you freakin say something?

359
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:27,903
Rym: Yeah, I think the educators in this country really underestimate kids.

360
00:18:27,963 --> 00:18:29,728
Scott: Well, you know no child left behind.

361
00:18:29,749 --> 00:18:34,103
Rym: Yeah Yeah I gotta gotta go to that lowest common denominator and everyone underestimates kids.

362
00:18:34,143 --> 00:18:35,870
Scott: if we ready we let kids run the country.

363
00:18:36,312 --> 00:18:37,638
Scott: They who you wouldn't have a deficit.

364
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,407
Scott: He couldn't have a war.

365
00:18:40,956 --> 00:18:47,449
Rym: Imagine we'd have some other problems like All the retirement money and Social Security probably disappear.

366
00:18:49,591 --> 00:18:52,842
Scott: The kids like their grandparents, yeah grandparents spoil them.

367
00:18:53,183 --> 00:18:54,146
Scott: they might let them have it.

368
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:58,038
Rym: I Picture wars starting over silly things.

369
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:02,330
Scott: at least it's bet young for his old is better than poor verse rich.

370
00:19:03,051 --> 00:19:05,775
Rym: Yeah First remember the u.s.

371
00:19:06,116 --> 00:19:10,190
Rym: Didn't sign the Human Rights Accord specifically because the Human Rights Accord gave rights to children.

372
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,550
Scott: Well, no, they specifically didn't sign it for other reasons.

373
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:13,474
Scott: That's just one of those.

374
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:20,441
Rym: one of the reasons one of the main ones because they didn't the way it was worded Technically you couldn't take you like America.

375
00:19:20,642 --> 00:19:24,337
Rym: children aren't allowed to sign contracts and things like that And legally that would make it so.

376
00:19:24,357 --> 00:19:25,482
Rym: children can sign contracts.

377
00:19:25,562 --> 00:19:27,010
Scott: Those should be able to sign contracts.

378
00:19:27,231 --> 00:19:28,516
Scott: Yeah, in fact, you know what?

379
00:19:28,557 --> 00:19:34,861
Scott: There are some people who are old enough and allowed to sign contracts You shouldn't and there are children who can who aren't allowed to.

380
00:19:34,881 --> 00:19:38,913
Scott: I say if you can understand the contract and prove you understand It then you can sign it.

381
00:19:38,973 --> 00:19:39,936
Scott: It doesn't matter you can't.

382
00:19:40,097 --> 00:19:43,026
Rym: age discrimination that what I can't really have.

383
00:19:43,066 --> 00:19:44,029
Rym: subjective measures like.

384
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:44,652
Scott: well You know you.

385
00:19:44,672 --> 00:19:45,558
Scott: someone reads the cut.

386
00:19:45,578 --> 00:19:47,470
Rym: you say who says they're the authority?

387
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,515
Scott: No Someone reads the contract.

388
00:19:49,676 --> 00:19:51,322
Scott: then they explain what they just read.

389
00:19:51,462 --> 00:19:53,610
Scott: if they're accurate then they can sign it.

390
00:19:53,871 --> 00:19:56,138
Rym: Who do they explain it to what if the lawyers?

391
00:19:56,319 --> 00:20:03,063
Rym: ha because the lawyers are because the judge is always the smartest person Not just the elected schmo who even if he's not the smartest person.

392
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:03,585
Scott: He's a judge.

393
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:04,167
Scott: He judges.

394
00:20:04,207 --> 00:20:04,810
Scott: That's his job.

395
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,838
Scott: Yeah, he's the one who judges.

396
00:20:07,858 --> 00:20:09,748
Rym: I don't know how much I trust some judges.

397
00:20:09,788 --> 00:20:14,090
Scott: sometimes Do you need a jury to sit there and listen to someone describe the contract?

398
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,870
Scott: They just read to prove that they don't know.

399
00:20:17,352 --> 00:20:18,899
Rym: Crap people on a jury or people who can't.

400
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:21,490
Scott: it has to be someone who decides things.

401
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:23,620
Scott: We have we have people deciding things.

402
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,565
Scott: We need someone to decide.

403
00:20:24,585 --> 00:20:25,550
Scott: that's who it is as a judge.

404
00:20:26,952 --> 00:20:27,748
Scott: That's the way it works.

405
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:32,790
Scott: See the thing if you don't like what a judge decides you can get a smarter judge who's been a judge for longer.

406
00:20:33,652 --> 00:20:36,861
Rym: Four tries it doesn't matter cuz that's not how it is.

407
00:20:36,881 --> 00:20:37,984
Scott: It's not how it is.

408
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:40,250
Scott: That's how it should be and we'll see.

409
00:20:41,413 --> 00:20:43,970
Rym: Well, we won't see you cuz things buy whatever change not anytime soon.

410
00:20:44,071 --> 00:20:45,397
Scott: Anyway, no not soon.

411
00:20:45,618 --> 00:20:51,541
Scott: unless we get some off Parising happening around here We're not gonna have Parising around now, but all of Europe might Paris.

412
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:56,922
Rym: I don't think Germany will no Italy they're fine.

413
00:20:56,942 --> 00:20:57,810
Rym: They'll just ride their scooters.

414
00:20:59,373 --> 00:21:00,629
Scott: France France will Paris.

415
00:21:03,385 --> 00:21:11,270
Rym: I Mean if you look back historically, this isn't the first time that you know, the poor rioted in Paris.

416
00:21:12,213 --> 00:21:13,566
Rym: Remember the whole Paris commune?

417
00:21:15,331 --> 00:21:21,930
Scott: No, I remember a vivre la voix vivre la voix and it was a guy's name Horatio hornblower.

418
00:21:22,071 --> 00:21:25,309
Scott: No, no, no, no, no the French guy.

419
00:21:25,932 --> 00:21:27,880
Rym: That narrows it down a lot the.

420
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,210
Scott: how long a know the evil guy.

421
00:21:31,096 --> 00:21:32,185
Rym: Who are Robespierre?

422
00:21:32,265 --> 00:21:36,170
Rym: Yeah You just remember Robespierre because that game we used to play.

423
00:21:36,234 --> 00:21:39,462
Scott: No I actually I didn't think of it until you said his name what they did.

424
00:21:39,543 --> 00:21:41,250
Scott: the game did not come before in the.

425
00:21:41,892 --> 00:21:55,629
Scott: You said Rose Pierre and I was like that was the guy and then the card appeared in my head with his face Afterwards and then you said it Nada Louis the 16. now he sucks.

426
00:21:56,571 --> 00:21:59,382
Rym: Whoever was against a ratio in that one episode of hornblower.

427
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:00,226
Scott: No, he sucks.

428
00:22:00,386 --> 00:22:03,328
Scott: Yeah Was that cake lady?

429
00:22:03,348 --> 00:22:05,713
Rym: oh You mean Marie Antoinette?

430
00:22:05,994 --> 00:22:08,001
Rym: Yeah that lady, you know, let them eat cake.

431
00:22:08,302 --> 00:22:08,482
Scott: Yeah.

432
00:22:08,522 --> 00:22:08,703
Scott: Yeah.

433
00:22:08,723 --> 00:22:08,924
Scott: Yeah.

434
00:22:09,385 --> 00:22:10,870
Rym: Yeah, they have no bread.

435
00:22:12,496 --> 00:22:13,288
Scott: Let them eat cake.

436
00:22:14,153 --> 00:22:22,381
Rym: Yes an accurate rendition of what she actually said in those faded final days Complete with the accurate period voice.

437
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:24,469
Scott: I might add off with your head.

438
00:22:27,424 --> 00:22:32,219
Rym: So It's science and tech day Alright, and we can't argue about science.

439
00:22:32,259 --> 00:22:34,789
Rym: So we'll argue about tech window managers.

440
00:22:37,292 --> 00:22:39,540
Scott: You know, I've pretty much tried everyone to manage who there is.

441
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:45,650
Scott: I have tried four of them and they all suck Yeah, but in different ways always in a different way.

442
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:52,849
Rym: See I've noticed a lot of people just like people I talked to at work or people I talked to on the street Or just people who don't use Linux or they don't use it much.

443
00:22:54,351 --> 00:23:00,450
Rym: You picking a window manager is one of the first problems they have because that's not even a consideration in windows.

444
00:23:00,751 --> 00:23:05,836
Scott: It is there used to be that light step thing or I don't know if I think it still exists and all those things you Had to go out and get by default.

445
00:23:05,877 --> 00:23:08,107
Rym: you install windows and you get windows.

446
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:08,810
Scott: by default.

447
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:10,418
Scott: If you install Ubuntu you get.

448
00:23:10,478 --> 00:23:10,780
Scott: no.

449
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,729
Scott: if you install kubuntu you get KDE.

450
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:14,493
Scott: Yeah and there was just a thing.

451
00:23:14,553 --> 00:23:19,047
Scott: my mark shuttleworth is using kubuntu and he wants kubuntu to become as cuz.

452
00:23:19,087 --> 00:23:20,832
Scott: right now kubuntu is like The backseat.

453
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:24,143
Scott: he wants kubuntu to be like in the passenger seat right next to.

454
00:23:24,906 --> 00:23:25,427
Rym: I don't like it.

455
00:23:25,468 --> 00:23:26,130
Rym: he's so much.

456
00:23:26,511 --> 00:23:31,887
Scott: I don't like it so much either but apparently some people do and Katie distributions are dying left and right.

457
00:23:32,268 --> 00:23:35,032
Scott: so I Mean Katie.

458
00:23:35,072 --> 00:23:37,198
Scott: he was the first window manager I used ever.

459
00:23:37,218 --> 00:23:40,407
Scott: I mean it was back in the back back days.

460
00:23:40,427 --> 00:23:41,390
Scott: It was Katie one.

461
00:23:41,932 --> 00:23:44,702
Scott: Yeah, then Katie to came out and I was like what did then?

462
00:23:44,742 --> 00:23:45,485
Rym: did three come out?

463
00:23:45,746 --> 00:23:57,680
Scott: Yeah for well, no, no I don't know what versions out now, but when two gave up when two came out it was like a hundred times better than one and Then when three came out it was a little bit better than two.

464
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:04,830
Scott: and then I discovered other things and Katie was boo Yeah, yeah The real Katie would be good.

465
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:11,350
Scott: The problem is it uses this the QT library, which I don't like as much as the GTK library at all.

466
00:24:12,214 --> 00:24:15,350
Scott: You know, it's all blitz not none of these skins for it even look good.

467
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:19,604
Scott: They're all ugly and bloated and not even considering the licensing issues.

468
00:24:20,066 --> 00:24:25,165
Rym: Well, plus Katie itself I mean unless you pre-link it it's always fuck.

469
00:24:25,546 --> 00:24:27,675
Scott: Oh, it's slow Horrendously slow.

470
00:24:27,776 --> 00:24:30,950
Rym: pre-linking will fix that but a lot of people don't want to go through the trouble of free.

471
00:24:31,112 --> 00:24:31,860
Scott: I don't pre-link.

472
00:24:31,901 --> 00:24:32,690
Scott: it's not worth the effort.

473
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:36,387
Rym: I pre-link and I but I have an older slower computer and I need to pre-link.

474
00:24:36,488 --> 00:24:36,769
Rym: now.

475
00:24:37,673 --> 00:24:44,001
Scott: I'm thinking about buying a dual CPU Athlon 64 machine someday Maybe a dual dual core.

476
00:24:44,403 --> 00:24:45,690
Scott: then I won't need to pre-link anything.

477
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:51,010
Scott: But the real problem with Katie is that there's just so many options.

478
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:59,384
Rym: It's like you open an options window is like a hajillion checkboxes and yet even though there's so many options Half the time I still wouldn't find exactly what I wanted to do.

479
00:24:59,404 --> 00:24:59,464
Scott: Yep.

480
00:24:59,605 --> 00:25:00,690
Scott: We're just not in there.

481
00:25:00,972 --> 00:25:03,029
Scott: There are some good things at Katie like a parts.

482
00:25:03,632 --> 00:25:08,550
Scott: Yeah, K parts is good, which lets you put any piece of a like pieces of programs in others.

483
00:25:09,072 --> 00:25:13,709
Scott: It's like you'll be using one program and like a mail will creep into the same window, you know.

484
00:25:14,673 --> 00:25:16,358
Scott: And some of the Katie programs are good.

485
00:25:16,398 --> 00:25:18,064
Scott: I guess ko Pete is okay.

486
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:19,750
Scott: It's like the game of Katie.

487
00:25:20,774 --> 00:25:21,744
Scott: Hey, right came out.

488
00:25:21,764 --> 00:25:22,289
Scott: They're okay.

489
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:31,861
Rym: I mean, I guess I look at Katie and gnome as being pretty much equivalent because they're both the Giant window managers full of stuff because they're not just a window manager.

490
00:25:31,901 --> 00:25:33,305
Scott: They're a desktop environment.

491
00:25:33,566 --> 00:25:35,050
Rym: Yeah, they come with utilities.

492
00:25:35,291 --> 00:25:37,078
Scott: It's like a gnome and gnome.

493
00:25:37,098 --> 00:25:38,683
Scott: the window manager is Metasity.

494
00:25:38,864 --> 00:25:40,430
Scott: you could use just Metasity if you want.

495
00:25:40,731 --> 00:25:43,441
Rym: I actually use Metasity with ice wm.

496
00:25:43,662 --> 00:25:44,264
Rym: Oh at work.

497
00:25:44,384 --> 00:25:44,786
Scott: Look at that.

498
00:25:45,207 --> 00:25:46,895
Rym: Yeah Well, I did.

499
00:25:46,915 --> 00:25:48,161
Rym: I stopped doing that for reasons.

500
00:25:48,181 --> 00:25:52,018
Rym: I won't get into now, but well Metasity is kind of slow on an old machine.

501
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:57,622
Rym: Yeah, Metasity is kind of slow, but not as slow as Anything that's even remotely related to Katie.

502
00:25:57,963 --> 00:26:00,899
Scott: Well, you know, it's how it is But you know when you want.

503
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:02,270
Scott: people want all that stuff.

504
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:06,772
Scott: They want it to be comfortable and they want to have everything in a GUI and they want to be able to do all these Things.

505
00:26:06,832 --> 00:26:09,450
Rym: and you know what I do too because I run gnome on my main machine.

506
00:26:09,658 --> 00:26:14,929
Scott: Yeah There are some real useful things in in Katie and gnome that I you can do.

507
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:16,299
Scott: that You can't do without like.

508
00:26:16,339 --> 00:26:21,201
Scott: I know Nautilus lets you Browse like SSH, you know sftps.

509
00:26:21,221 --> 00:26:23,310
Scott: Yeah, that's really useful.

510
00:26:25,391 --> 00:26:26,034
Scott: What else is really?

511
00:26:26,134 --> 00:26:27,218
Scott: so you know what the thing is.

512
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,310
Scott: you use Katie your gnome you get a working system tray.

513
00:26:31,072 --> 00:26:34,856
Scott: Yes, no matter any other Window manager desktop environment.

514
00:26:35,016 --> 00:26:37,924
Scott: The system tray is always broken or fickle or something.

515
00:26:37,964 --> 00:26:39,127
Rym: Yeah, or ice wm.

516
00:26:39,188 --> 00:26:40,953
Rym: It's just ugly Ugly.

517
00:26:41,334 --> 00:26:47,270
Scott: sometimes you can use a program like XY systray or things like that, but they're never perfect.

518
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:50,583
Scott: You have to move around and they're all broken and I mean gnome right here.

519
00:26:50,804 --> 00:26:55,202
Rym: I've got my little system tray and I've got Oh, yeah, don't even think about calling it the notification area.

520
00:26:55,262 --> 00:26:57,090
Rym: No, which is the proper name for it?

521
00:26:58,494 --> 00:27:00,090
Rym: It's got my little game thing.

522
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:04,989
Rym: I got my little character input thing for Japanese and Korean and all that other stuff.

523
00:27:05,109 --> 00:27:09,389
Rym: No Yeah, you know basically you got to choose between.

524
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,384
Rym: Do you want it?

525
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:11,251
Rym: Do you want?

526
00:27:11,612 --> 00:27:13,278
Rym: I like an all-encompassing environment?

527
00:27:13,318 --> 00:27:17,170
Rym: that'll just work and then you can tweak it within itself, or do you want more?

528
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:20,402
Rym: Customizability but comes with that great responsibility.

529
00:27:20,643 --> 00:27:28,010
Scott: Well, it's not so much that you're losing Customizability because you can use fvwm which is infinite customizability.

530
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:30,801
Scott: Yeah, it's just not in a gooby and it's not easy.

531
00:27:30,821 --> 00:27:32,990
Scott: and there's you know, if you know, it's not easy.

532
00:27:33,131 --> 00:27:47,374
Rym: I tried to make an fvwm and I started stealing things from other people because other people have made these freaking amazing Fvwm desktops where things fly around and everything's pretty and perfect, but they're so customized to the person who made it I can't even use them.

533
00:27:47,394 --> 00:27:58,009
Scott: The real problem with fvwm is that you can do anything technically But to do things that are outside the normal bounds of what fvwm does you do something crazy hackish.

534
00:27:58,633 --> 00:28:03,490
Scott: Like if you want something to fly across the screen There isn't a function like make it fly across the screen to the right.

535
00:28:03,992 --> 00:28:10,876
Scott: You pretty much have to like redraw it moving it to the right by X pixels and write a function that does it with a loop You know and you'd go.

536
00:28:10,976 --> 00:28:15,070
Scott: you have to actually program stuff and sometimes you don't program it directly like that.

537
00:28:15,391 --> 00:28:25,245
Scott: It's like use some other obscure thing and bind it to an event and then force the event to happen Artificially and make it do something scarily enough.

538
00:28:25,326 --> 00:28:26,070
Rym: a lot of people do that.

539
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:30,830
Rym: Anyway, there are ricers for fvwm and they do crazy silly things.

540
00:28:31,432 --> 00:28:36,208
Scott: Well, a lot of them just have stuff done and once you get to the point where most of its done You can just keep using it.

541
00:28:36,671 --> 00:28:41,529
Scott: Yeah, and if you have a lot of free time like I did in college when I used fvwm you could do that.

542
00:28:42,091 --> 00:28:53,481
Scott: But then as soon as I switched up monitor resolutions everything fell apart and now I just don't use it anymore cuz I don't have time, you know There's also the real simple little ones like I still you have.

543
00:28:53,501 --> 00:28:54,263
Rym: it's just real tiny.

544
00:28:54,584 --> 00:28:55,968
Rym: It looks like Windows 95, but it works.

545
00:28:57,051 --> 00:28:59,701
Scott: Yeah, there's a EWM which is kind of like that.

546
00:28:59,741 --> 00:29:00,203
Rym: What's that one?

547
00:29:00,243 --> 00:29:02,050
Rym: Steve uses the really light cool one.

548
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:02,838
Scott: Well, that's ion.

549
00:29:02,858 --> 00:29:08,082
Scott: that's the guys completely different Yeah, but there's terms a little do-nothing ones is like all the boxes.

550
00:29:08,102 --> 00:29:19,255
Scott: F open box flux box You know, it's just they give you like a menu in a bar in a background Yeah, and everything else is up to you, you know, oh you can add desktops But those don't.

551
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:21,789
Scott: it's like people use those and they're like, oh, this is so great.

552
00:29:22,791 --> 00:29:25,200
Scott: It's like you can't even it doesn't even do anything.

553
00:29:25,461 --> 00:29:32,770
Scott: Yeah, I can't customize it to do stuff I want and it's really it's just like a tiny thing that just like it's like a placeholder.

554
00:29:33,411 --> 00:29:34,678
Scott: It's like I need a window manager.

555
00:29:34,738 --> 00:29:35,864
Scott: Here's one that does nothing.

556
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:39,726
Rym: I Mean if you're gonna do that, anyway, just why even have a go?

557
00:29:39,746 --> 00:29:40,410
Rym: II what are you doing?

558
00:29:40,591 --> 00:29:43,401
Scott: Well, they had they got like a menu and they get virtual desktop switcher.

559
00:29:43,923 --> 00:29:44,846
Scott: Yeah, that's all they get.

560
00:29:44,886 --> 00:29:48,502
Rym: pretty much telling you man She's terminals and rat poison rat poison.

561
00:29:48,522 --> 00:29:59,724
Scott: I mean, I never used rat poison, but from what I gather it's really just terminals, yeah You can get like a window in a terminal kinda.

562
00:29:59,744 --> 00:30:00,810
Scott: Yeah, that's about it.

563
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:05,303
Scott: It's really not that great, but it's like the most minimal minimal anything.

564
00:30:05,423 --> 00:30:07,409
Rym: It's the most maximal a terminal is gonna be.

565
00:30:09,878 --> 00:30:10,707
Scott: That's About right.

566
00:30:11,832 --> 00:30:19,968
Scott: But yeah, I on the one that Steve Steve uses and that I'm starting to use It's actually pretty weird because that you can split up your screen you make it a grid out of it.

567
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:26,249
Scott: You can either you know, and it actually handles like separate monitors correctly and it handles all this stuff.

568
00:30:27,032 --> 00:30:48,805
Scott: but you know you can get menus and you can do stuff like you can say bind so when I push whatever a little prompt pops up and Then I if I type in let's say me and me dotnet it'll open up a terminal in that frame That is already SSHing You know, it could do stuff like that.

569
00:30:49,772 --> 00:30:54,090
Scott: But all it really is is just split the window up into frames resize them move them.

570
00:30:54,511 --> 00:30:57,763
Scott: each frame can have as many windows as you want and they're all get tabbed.

571
00:30:57,783 --> 00:30:59,872
Scott: and That's it.

572
00:31:00,977 --> 00:31:01,921
Scott: And you get bindings.

573
00:31:01,981 --> 00:31:03,729
Scott: you can bind keyboard things to stuff.

574
00:31:05,052 --> 00:31:06,861
Rym: It also does your a dual screen properly.

575
00:31:06,921 --> 00:31:08,730
Rym: I just said that I wasn't listening to at all.

576
00:31:09,131 --> 00:31:12,264
Rym: I can't stop looking at this horrible picture from cluster edge.

577
00:31:13,589 --> 00:31:17,466
Rym: Oh Yeah, remember cluster edge the show that that was.

578
00:31:17,486 --> 00:31:18,210
Rym: yeah.

579
00:31:18,792 --> 00:31:24,189
Rym: Well, there's this picture and I'll put a link in the post because I think it sums up everything that this show is very succinctly.

580
00:31:24,992 --> 00:31:28,063
Scott: Hi, you're not gonna show the picture like the guys looking at each other anything.

581
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:30,190
Rym: I think this picture says it all.

582
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:34,050
Scott: Uh It's nothing to do with window managing.

583
00:31:35,192 --> 00:31:38,629
Rym: I had the window open and I turned around and I saw it and it just distracted me.

584
00:31:39,412 --> 00:31:41,541
Scott: Oh, you don't wouldn't imagine we forgot XFC.

585
00:31:41,561 --> 00:31:44,716
Rym: Oh I've never used it.

586
00:31:45,542 --> 00:31:46,146
Scott: You used it.

587
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:47,915
Scott: Remember using it.

588
00:31:48,116 --> 00:31:49,221
Rym: Well, no, I didn't.

589
00:31:49,342 --> 00:31:50,929
Rym: I read windows for a long time.

590
00:31:51,752 --> 00:31:54,760
Scott: Anyway, XFC is like the in-between window manager.

591
00:31:55,041 --> 00:31:56,245
Scott: I used it a whole lot.

592
00:31:56,305 --> 00:31:57,949
Scott: But now I don't I kind of forgot about it.

593
00:31:58,793 --> 00:32:02,869
Scott: It's like you get the nice gooey gnome stuff, but a lot less of it.

594
00:32:03,612 --> 00:32:06,544
Scott: But you actually have stuff unlike flexbox.

595
00:32:06,564 --> 00:32:07,728
Scott: We've like almost nothing.

596
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:18,805
Scott: Panel and you can customize the panel and there's a bunch of control panel settings You can set and you can get menus that do things.

597
00:32:19,206 --> 00:32:23,388
Rym: you get themes Yeah, cuz those menus that don't do anything or just awesome.

598
00:32:23,428 --> 00:32:23,709
Scott: It's like it.

599
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:29,125
Scott: Oh, it's a real light and it does stuff, you know, but it uses GTK like gnome does.

600
00:32:29,526 --> 00:32:31,030
Scott: yeah, it's actually pretty good.

601
00:32:31,572 --> 00:32:35,814
Scott: You know if someone has like a weak weak computer They can't and they're they.

602
00:32:36,155 --> 00:32:36,818
Scott: it's not someone.

603
00:32:36,838 --> 00:32:40,069
Scott: you would normally give Katie your gnome, but their computers too weak.

604
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:41,840
Scott: Xfce is like the trick.

605
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,050
Rym: that makes sense.

606
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:52,450
Rym: You don't want to give them like I still UM because they won't be able to make it Yeah, and if you can't make it look good Yeah, and if you're someone who like, you know is using something lesser and it's not enough.

607
00:32:52,871 --> 00:32:56,186
Scott: But you don't like the slowness of gnome and Katie you can go to Xfce.

608
00:32:56,226 --> 00:32:59,099
Scott: Yeah Oh Enlightenment that's right.

609
00:32:59,442 --> 00:33:08,141
Scott: Yeah enlightenment is Interesting Enlightenment 16 which is what's currently stable?

610
00:33:08,502 --> 00:33:11,170
Rym: Oh, yeah, we're not gonna not even 17 all the way.

611
00:33:11,451 --> 00:33:15,390
Scott: Yeah, 16 like if you saw a few years ago, it blow you away.

612
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:22,818
Scott: It's so cool looking and it doesn't use as much resources as things that are less cool looking Yeah, but nowadays it's not so impressive.

613
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:23,782
Scott: that's really like.

614
00:33:23,822 --> 00:33:32,270
Scott: the goal of it is to look cool You know while not using resources, but you know, it's not really something you can use.

615
00:33:32,451 --> 00:33:34,205
Scott: I mean some people use it, but I can't.

616
00:33:34,305 --> 00:33:37,709
Scott: it's like It's not practical for doing anything.

617
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:43,634
Rym: No Unless you want if you want a really cool desktop like you see in the movies where someone's doing stuff in a movie on a Computer.

618
00:33:44,157 --> 00:33:45,790
Rym: you could make something awesome in enlightenment.

619
00:33:46,512 --> 00:33:52,510
Scott: But enlightenment 17 actually looks like it's useful and it does all sorts of OS X things and it's you know.

620
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:54,140
Scott: It doesn't use a whole bunch of resources.

621
00:33:54,201 --> 00:34:02,150
Scott: It's actually really wicked fast Uses your video card for everything like it should you know, it's all cool and I got it to work.

622
00:34:02,431 --> 00:34:03,959
Scott: There's a live CD that you can get.

623
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,190
Scott: it's a live the enlightenment live CD.

624
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:11,960
Scott: You just put it in you choose enlightenment 17 and you can test it out on your computer to see what it's like and it worked great.

625
00:34:12,282 --> 00:34:17,900
Scott: Yeah, but Can't get that to actually install permanently on my computer.

626
00:34:17,922 --> 00:34:18,804
Scott: I mean I can.

627
00:34:19,125 --> 00:34:20,610
Scott: I could install from the live CD.

628
00:34:21,594 --> 00:34:28,850
Scott: You know the distribution that's on the live CD copied my hard drive But I want to use enlightenment 17 in gen 2 or Ubuntu.

629
00:34:29,031 --> 00:34:32,270
Scott: I don't even think you can use it in Ubuntu or anything like that.

630
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:40,268
Scott: I mean people do it But it's so much effort and it's like you can ruin your computer like 10 different ways trying to get it to go.

631
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:45,367
Scott: I think it'll be stable though within like a year or so and you'll actually do.

632
00:34:45,388 --> 00:34:49,062
Rym: To use in gen 2 don't you need to have like not even tilde but like star.

633
00:34:49,101 --> 00:34:54,578
Scott: Yeah, it has the the hyphen star Keyword which is like beyond bleeding edge.

634
00:34:54,938 --> 00:34:56,203
Rym: It's like the knife already cut you.

635
00:34:56,424 --> 00:34:58,310
Scott: Yeah, you're pretty much just stabbing yourself.

636
00:34:59,005 --> 00:34:59,672
Scott: You know They it's.

637
00:34:59,792 --> 00:35:06,601
Scott: it's pretty much like we want to put these e builds in here because we made them and you put them in here If you really want to use them, but you should never use them.

638
00:35:07,143 --> 00:35:08,730
Scott: Yeah, they're not for you.

639
00:35:10,952 --> 00:35:22,297
Scott: The really the the trick behind - star is that It's so hard to actually get something with - star to install and work, you know, well, maybe we should clarify.

640
00:35:22,317 --> 00:35:25,700
Rym: in gen 2 There are keywords.

641
00:35:27,121 --> 00:35:29,550
Rym: Yeah, so like say that normally it's x86.

642
00:35:29,932 --> 00:35:32,040
Scott: Well, it's X easy if you have an X 80 process.

643
00:35:32,201 --> 00:35:33,548
Rym: Most of most people have an X 80.

644
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:34,553
Scott: some people have PPC.

645
00:35:34,814 --> 00:35:41,480
Rym: Yeah AMD 64 Yeah, but anyway, so that's like the normal keyword and you compile things but some things are a little bleeding edge.

646
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:49,380
Rym: So like a version 9 of something will be out in x86, but nine point one will be released under tilde.

647
00:35:50,301 --> 00:35:51,806
Rym: So you don't install that right away.

648
00:35:51,847 --> 00:35:53,814
Rym: It only moves to x86 when it's stable.

649
00:35:53,934 --> 00:35:55,580
Scott: Well, it's called tilde is testing.

650
00:35:56,062 --> 00:35:59,317
Scott: So when they make a new e build right I made a new e build for the new version.

651
00:35:59,337 --> 00:36:02,972
Scott: you put it in testing Yep, and then as soon as it's cover it been tested enough.

652
00:36:03,414 --> 00:36:04,478
Scott: They take the tilde off.

653
00:36:05,442 --> 00:36:09,250
Rym: Star is like Yeah, I haven't even really compiled this yet.

654
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:09,853
Rym: Here you go.

655
00:36:10,074 --> 00:36:11,360
Scott: Yeah, it's like we made an e build.

656
00:36:11,725 --> 00:36:13,625
Scott: Here it is you know.

657
00:36:13,685 --> 00:36:22,580
Scott: and the thing about testing is like When it's stable, that means it works on any machine with you know, so if it's sometimes you'll see a package.

658
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,330
Scott: It'll be like stable x86 and PPC.

659
00:36:25,771 --> 00:36:28,140
Scott: But if you have an AMD 64, it'll still be tilde.

660
00:36:28,526 --> 00:36:29,298
Scott: Yeah, you know.

661
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:37,660
Scott: But if it's if it's regular x86 that means it's guaranteed to work on any x86 computer No matter what your combination of software is unless you have something broken.

662
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:41,513
Scott: It's not a guarantee or a warranty, but it is a function.

663
00:36:41,573 --> 00:36:43,700
Rym: properly it will run on your processor.

664
00:36:44,081 --> 00:36:49,120
Scott: Yeah, 99% but they don't make a guarantee about it, but it's very much guaranteed.

665
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:53,689
Scott: Minus star isn't a tilde is saying we don't guarantee.

666
00:36:53,749 --> 00:36:57,579
Rym: It might screw you because I guarantee this will break your computer.

667
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,270
Scott: go away There's a very slim chance.

668
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,620
Scott: It won't break your computer.

669
00:37:01,664 --> 00:37:03,180
Scott: You know, you have to be like a real magician.

670
00:37:03,762 --> 00:37:10,118
Rym: Yeah, if you want to see enlightenment 17 get that CD and look at how pretty it is and then just forget about it Cuz you'll never get it.

671
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:15,000
Scott: You'll get it like a year from now and or you can just take that live CD and install from the live CD.

672
00:37:15,941 --> 00:37:21,080
Scott: The problem is I had it be window manager crashed on me a bunch, but it does crash very gracefully.

673
00:37:23,201 --> 00:37:25,937
Rym: Yeah, that's so much better than not crashing.

674
00:37:25,957 --> 00:37:34,355
Scott: well windows You know it crashes right and then you can't do anything and pretty much your only Resource is to reset the whole computer with a hard reset when enlightenment crashes.

675
00:37:34,375 --> 00:37:35,880
Scott: It's just like I've crashed.

676
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:46,320
Scott: will you please click this button and now we'll start up again and it starts up again in like two seconds, you know and That's the other good thing is that X won't crash but enlightenment will crash.

677
00:37:46,701 --> 00:37:50,234
Scott: So they all your windows will just lose all their windowing and then they'll gain it all again.

678
00:37:50,756 --> 00:37:51,720
Scott: So you don't actually lose anything.

679
00:37:53,222 --> 00:37:59,051
Scott: Uh-huh window managers crashing isn't so bad X crashing you'll lose all your running X applications.

680
00:37:59,111 --> 00:37:59,312
Rym: Yeah.

681
00:37:59,412 --> 00:38:01,620
Scott: Yeah, but that doesn't happen.

682
00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:06,940
Rym: Actually, no, I haven't had it happen except when I had video card broken things a long time ago.

683
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:32,827
Scott: what's really funny is that I heard an interview with the enlightenment guy and Apparently he's developing enlightenment 17 using enlightenment 16 running on an X server in OS X. So he has a Mac running OS X with X running on that with enlightenment 16 running on that with an X nest running enlightenment 17 to test enlightenment 17 as he codes it.

684
00:38:33,208 --> 00:38:42,520
Rym: that reminds me of back at RIT when you would SSH into a CS machine and then SSH from that back to your machine and then from that to another machine and then you try to X forward over all that.

685
00:38:42,741 --> 00:38:44,794
Scott: Yeah with the with a 3d program.

686
00:38:44,915 --> 00:38:45,599
Scott: Yeah, it worked.

687
00:38:46,021 --> 00:38:51,700
Scott: Yeah, if you make a loop of SSH is or you tried to like go back at all SSH like freaking complaints.

688
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,835
Scott: It's like oh my god security someone spying on you.

689
00:38:53,876 --> 00:38:56,328
Scott: Oh my god Which I guess is good.

690
00:38:56,388 --> 00:38:57,033
Scott: It's that smart.

691
00:38:57,436 --> 00:38:59,424
Scott: Yeah Can't fool SSH.

692
00:38:59,845 --> 00:39:00,587
Scott: It's really secure.

693
00:39:00,888 --> 00:39:02,192
Rym: Hey, you can fool SSH one.

694
00:39:02,212 --> 00:39:07,440
Scott: Yeah, no one uses SSH one You'd be surprised.

695
00:39:09,721 --> 00:39:11,224
Scott: No, no, I wouldn't.

696
00:39:11,646 --> 00:39:16,233
Rym: I know a lot of people who there's a two Uh Mostly like.

697
00:39:16,474 --> 00:39:19,066
Scott: well, I don't even I didn't even specify one or two.

698
00:39:19,166 --> 00:39:21,435
Scott: two is the default But you can't use one.

699
00:39:21,455 --> 00:39:25,308
Rym: a lot of people are running old like Red Hat seven machines that only support one.

700
00:39:25,348 --> 00:39:25,769
Rym: unless you go.

701
00:39:25,789 --> 00:39:28,405
Scott: did They click don't they notice that like red spinning thing.

702
00:39:28,425 --> 00:39:29,189
Scott: This is update me.

703
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:30,093
Rym: No the update.

704
00:39:30,113 --> 00:39:31,297
Rym: remember Red Hat.

705
00:39:31,317 --> 00:39:34,870
Rym: seven point two is still supported and gets updates automatically.

706
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:36,103
Rym: 7.1 is seven point three.

707
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:41,050
Rym: You have to sign up for the Red Hat Network and you don't get all the updates and it doesn't work.

708
00:39:41,191 --> 00:39:42,921
Rym: So well, don't use Red Hat.

709
00:39:42,941 --> 00:39:44,390
Rym: seven point one or seven point three.

710
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:47,261
Scott: I never understood this like old version of Red Hat thing.

711
00:39:47,282 --> 00:39:49,009
Scott: You know, it's like you get peace.

712
00:39:50,651 --> 00:39:52,899
Rym: Red Hat does not even upgrade its kernel gracefully.

713
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,608
Rym: newer ones do but like old Red Hat if you tried to upgrade the kernel you Probably just hose your entire system.

714
00:39:58,912 --> 00:40:02,210
Scott: It bothers me so much as like people there are companies out there trying to be good.

715
00:40:02,671 --> 00:40:04,035
Scott: They make a Linux software.

716
00:40:04,055 --> 00:40:06,142
Scott: Yeah, and they might be for sale.

717
00:40:06,162 --> 00:40:07,486
Scott: It might be proprietary Linux.

718
00:40:07,606 --> 00:40:08,028
Scott: That's fine.

719
00:40:08,068 --> 00:40:08,830
Rym: I just want software.

720
00:40:08,911 --> 00:40:15,710
Scott: Yeah, they make software for Linux But they make it and they send it to you with like a distribution of like Red Hat seven.

721
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:17,072
Rym: Great.

722
00:40:17,112 --> 00:40:18,075
Rym: I really wanted that.

723
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:22,670
Scott: they've tested it on Red Hat seven and they've tested it with like Linux standard base.

724
00:40:23,131 --> 00:40:27,226
Rym: But then oh it uses this weird Red Hat thing or oh it doesn't do.

725
00:40:27,266 --> 00:40:30,278
Scott: this won't work on any other distribution except for the one they've sent you.

726
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:41,968
Rym: I've had installers and I was I mean It was installer and the script started and it would check for some like system variable But it would check for it in a form that no modern Linux uses and then it wouldn't install because it.

727
00:40:42,048 --> 00:40:43,494
Rym: oh you're not running The right blah blah blah.

728
00:40:43,594 --> 00:40:46,085
Scott: Yeah, it's like what I would have to do is like under.

729
00:40:46,205 --> 00:40:54,270
Scott: sometimes under the hood There's a program that will just work normally But they've written this whole suite of install scripts to get it to install.

730
00:40:54,832 --> 00:41:03,530
Scott: I would go in and I would modify all the install scripts to make them just be Normal and just copy the files to my hard drive that needed to be copied, you know.

731
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:06,725
Scott: And then it would be in a normal L effect LSB executable, whatever.

732
00:41:06,745 --> 00:41:07,669
Scott: I just run it and it would go.

733
00:41:07,931 --> 00:41:09,778
Scott: Yeah, you know cuz I had I had this.

734
00:41:09,878 --> 00:41:15,228
Scott: all the libraries are acquired and they were just newer versions But they were backwards compatible and it just worked.

735
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:19,505
Scott: But they write this crazy install system to make it easy for you.

736
00:41:19,786 --> 00:41:23,638
Scott: on the Red Hat distribution They give you or something and then it just doesn't work.

737
00:41:24,059 --> 00:41:24,280
Rym: Yep.

738
00:41:24,762 --> 00:41:30,989
Rym: Well some companies they make like a standard like alright Our installs will always go with a certain way like IBM is real bad about this.

739
00:41:31,371 --> 00:41:37,010
Rym: So all the IBM software out there that you can buy there are Linux versions of all the servers and the clients and the agents and everything.

740
00:41:37,871 --> 00:41:46,421
Rym: But they install like Windows programs like they put all their stuff in like a folder somewhere on your file system And then they don't put their executable in bin.

741
00:41:46,441 --> 00:41:47,829
Rym: They put it in like this crap plays.

742
00:41:49,391 --> 00:41:50,838
Rym: Yeah, it hurts.

743
00:41:51,401 --> 00:41:56,512
Scott: well, I mean sometimes you install Some things are supposed to go in opt Like.

744
00:41:56,552 --> 00:42:09,920
Scott: if you install open office like, you know, it's supposed to go in slash opt Open office and then all the files are in there and then in slash user bin There's a sim link to the open office executable.

745
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:15,222
Scott: or you include slash ops open office slash bin in your path Right or something like that.

746
00:42:15,322 --> 00:42:16,490
Rym: Yeah, there are multitude of ways.

747
00:42:16,731 --> 00:42:25,234
Scott: Yeah, and that's the way it's supposed to be because it's like a pre-compiled program or you know anything That's like big like that will do that Congen to.

748
00:42:25,274 --> 00:42:29,354
Scott: if you merge Firefox bin it goes in opt Firefox bin.

749
00:42:29,554 --> 00:42:34,008
Scott: Yeah, but if you build it, it goes in usr and everything split up how it's supposed to be.

750
00:42:34,108 --> 00:42:36,667
Scott: Yeah Which is the correct way.

751
00:42:37,336 --> 00:42:42,120
Scott: but People they make things not and people look at.

752
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:44,810
Scott: people are making free software free for no money.

753
00:42:45,371 --> 00:42:48,199
Rym: Alright, like new and they follow the standards.

754
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:52,815
Scott: they do things right and things work on every distribution with almost no effort You know.

755
00:42:52,895 --> 00:42:55,895
Scott: and if it's a source-based distribution No one has to modify anything.

756
00:42:56,015 --> 00:43:00,870
Scott: but then if it's a binary distribution one guy compiles it and it works on all the computers.

757
00:43:01,131 --> 00:43:01,894
Rym: Yeah, what was the last time?

758
00:43:01,914 --> 00:43:05,510
Rym: you tried to run an RPM and it didn't install and you were using the right version?

759
00:43:05,893 --> 00:43:09,974
Scott: yeah, and you had all the dependencies and And then it's six.

760
00:43:09,994 --> 00:43:17,098
Scott: you did force and it successfully installed and then it didn't run and you modified your path and you found The file and you ran it and it didn't run.

761
00:43:17,419 --> 00:43:20,650
Rym: Yeah often with an obscure error message like nothing.

762
00:43:21,052 --> 00:43:24,365
Scott: Yeah, it's cuz someone out there took the source for that program.

763
00:43:24,385 --> 00:43:25,550
Rym: Are you sure it was a seg fault?

764
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:28,229
