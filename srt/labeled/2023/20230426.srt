1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,066
Rym: It's Wednesday, April 26th, 2023.

2
00:00:10,066 --> 00:00:10,308
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,025 --> 00:00:14,500
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,427
Rym: And this is GeekNights Wednesday.

5
00:00:16,467 --> 00:00:19,440
Rym: Tonight we're talking about GeekNights Wednesday.

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,218
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:26,915
Rym: So I did something that kind of, I guess, it's not a surprise.

8
00:00:26,975 --> 00:00:28,620
Rym: Like something I even talked about on the show a little bit.

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,993
Rym: But we had a Japanese style hot water boiler in the kitchen forever.

10
00:00:32,054 --> 00:00:32,957
Rym: Like as long as we've lived here.

11
00:00:32,977 --> 00:00:33,660
Rym: And that thing's great.

12
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,624
Rym: But it was getting a little old.

13
00:00:36,425 --> 00:00:37,628
Rym: It was 2.2 liters.

14
00:00:37,648 --> 00:00:38,491
Rym: It was a Panasonic.

15
00:00:38,531 --> 00:00:41,578
Rym: And it was starting to wear out a little bit.

16
00:00:41,638 --> 00:00:42,320
Rym: Like occasionally.

17
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,760
Scott: Are you supposed to like, there's some maintenance you're supposed to do on it, right?

18
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:47,899
Rym: Oh no, we did all that stuff.

19
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,980
Scott: If it's really bad it can get like limescale or whatever.

20
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,063
Rym: Yeah, no, we handled all that stuff.

21
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:53,569
Rym: This is more like the control panel occasionally.

22
00:00:53,589 --> 00:00:56,998
Rym: Which is to be like, oh shit, and reboot and go back to like 190 degrees.

23
00:00:58,801 --> 00:01:00,760
Scott: Oh, well that's, you know, isn't that the default?

24
00:01:01,601 --> 00:01:08,280
Rym: It is the default, but it would like lose power on its own for a second and then come back and go back to the default even if I left it at a different temperature.

25
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,640
Scott: It could probably be repaired very easily.

26
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:16,880
Rym: It probably could, but we looked around and a lot of people have that same problem only with extremely old models of this one.

27
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,947
Scott: Yeah, but I mean it could still repair it.

28
00:01:18,967 --> 00:01:21,120
Scott: There's probably like some capacitor or something you could replace.

29
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,893
Rym: Oh yeah, but also I think the control panel itself has to be replaced.

30
00:01:24,913 --> 00:01:26,800
Rym: Like the whole, that bit that goes on the front.

31
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:32,460
Rym: Because sometimes if you hit buttons, they'll just like give up on you halfway through.

32
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,435
Rym: You replace the button.

33
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,600
Rym: Minor electrical, yeah, but they're all the buttons in the little control panel that's glued onto this thing.

34
00:01:39,082 --> 00:01:42,200
Rym: But anyway, we were still using it, but we had another problem.

35
00:01:42,921 --> 00:01:50,740
Rym: It was only 2.2 liters and it was actually starting to be not quite enough, especially now that we work from home a lot more, like we're around more.

36
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:54,549
Rym: Ever since COVID, we'd run out a lot.

37
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:59,380
Rym: We'd run out when I wanted to use it and it took a while to get back up to temperature.

38
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,280
Scott: You could push the reboil button to make it go faster.

39
00:02:03,341 --> 00:02:05,460
Rym: If you refill it, it just automatically does that.

40
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:13,440
Scott: I know that, but if you push the reboil button, it'll heat up, it'll go normal faster than if you just fill it up and close the lid.

41
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,420
Rym: Not according to the manual anyway.

42
00:02:15,901 --> 00:02:20,031
Rym: So all that we decided, we're going to give that one away because it still works, it's pretty fine.

43
00:02:20,071 --> 00:02:23,779
Rym: We wanted a bigger one, so we upgraded to the Zojirushi 3 liter.

44
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:34,100
Rym: And I guess what I'm surprised by is one, I didn't think the Zojirushi would actually be better in any material way.

45
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,520
Scott: Hot water is hot water, how is it better?

46
00:02:37,121 --> 00:02:42,893
Rym: And it wasn't more expensive than an equivalent model from all the other brands.

47
00:02:42,933 --> 00:02:46,600
Rym: They're all around the same price for that level of nice hot water boiler.

48
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,059
Rym: But I'm actually surprised at, in effect, how much better it is.

49
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:59,200
Rym: So despite holding a bunch more water, it's 3 liters, it gets to temperature shockingly fast.

50
00:03:00,525 --> 00:03:01,539
Scott: We got the 4 liter one.

51
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:12,420
Rym: 2, it has a pump the water out as fast as possible mode and a pump the water out slowly mode, which I find I'm actually using them both pretty equally.

52
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:17,620
Rym: 3, it, unlike the Panasonic, plays a little song whenever it's done.

53
00:03:17,902 --> 00:03:18,539
Scott: Of course it plays a song.

54
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,020
Rym: Yeah, but the Panasonic didn't, this one does, I like that.

55
00:03:21,621 --> 00:03:22,325
Scott: That's a problem.

56
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,380
Scott: Every single appliance we have in this house sings a song.

57
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,600
Rym: I know, I don't like appliances that don't sing songs.

58
00:03:28,522 --> 00:03:31,060
Scott: The dishwasher puts on a whole fucking symphony.

59
00:03:31,782 --> 00:03:33,479
Rym: I wish ours did, our dishwasher goes beep.

60
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,260
Rym: But the rice cooker, all the Zojirushi's play a nice song.

61
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:40,996
Scott: The washing machine plays a song, the fridge even sings.

62
00:03:42,141 --> 00:03:46,420
Rym: It actually has more precise temperature control and it has more options.

63
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,820
Rym: Like I can set more precise temperatures, which actually does matter for the kind of coffee that I brew.

64
00:03:52,581 --> 00:04:02,800
Rym: And I think the coffee it makes is, because I can control the temperature and I can up it like 5 degrees from 190, it is just better.

65
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,880
Rym: But I'm going to do a little bit of a blind test with the two.

66
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,779
Scott: Yeah, how would you know?

67
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:08,459
Rym: Exactly, so I'm going to do a test.

68
00:04:09,422 --> 00:04:12,900
Scott: It's like if it's the same water from the same sink at the same temperature.

69
00:04:13,021 --> 00:04:14,820
Rym: It's 5 degrees hotter.

70
00:04:15,967 --> 00:04:16,279
Scott: Okay.

71
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,640
Rym: Which actually does matter for extraction from like roundup coffee.

72
00:04:21,502 --> 00:04:23,600
Rym: But we'll see, but I just love the hell out of this thing.

73
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:33,780
Rym: So if anyone in New York City, we're going to give the perfectly fine, other than extremely minor, pretty much inconsequential problems with the control panel on the front.

74
00:04:34,622 --> 00:04:36,760
Rym: We're just going to give that one away to someone because it still works fine.

75
00:04:36,841 --> 00:04:39,020
Rym: But I really like this Zojirushi.

76
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,260
Scott: Yeah, I mean we basically had the same one.

77
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,880
Scott: I just don't use it very much because I don't drink hot beverages.

78
00:04:46,228 --> 00:04:46,920
Scott: And it's not winter.

79
00:04:47,843 --> 00:04:49,879
Scott: Hot chocolate is basically the only thing I use it for.

80
00:04:50,401 --> 00:04:53,760
Rym: I use it to make miso soup pretty often.

81
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,560
Scott: Oh yeah, we did use it for a miso soup.

82
00:04:57,301 --> 00:04:58,559
Scott: I don't eat miso soup that often.

83
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,240
Rym: I use it to rehydrate sun dried tomatoes and other things pretty often.

84
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,478
Rym: I use it to rehydrate mushrooms pretty often.

85
00:05:05,441 --> 00:05:06,480
Rym: I just use the sink water.

86
00:05:08,281 --> 00:05:10,160
Rym: You don't want to use hot water from the sink in food.

87
00:05:12,065 --> 00:05:12,359
Scott: Why not?

88
00:05:13,003 --> 00:05:14,770
Rym: That's generally ill-advised all over the world.

89
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,180
Rym: In fact, in the UK there's public health advisories about it.

90
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,458
Rym: Hot water in residential systems tends to have more minerals.

91
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:26,000
Rym: It picks up more contaminants from the pipes because of the temperature.

92
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,648
Rym: It's held longer.

93
00:05:27,668 --> 00:05:28,756
Rym: There's lots of stuff there.

94
00:05:30,522 --> 00:05:33,420
Rym: Not as much of a problem in newer buildings, but definitely a problem in old buildings.

95
00:05:34,745 --> 00:05:35,720
Rym: There's a whole thing there.

96
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,720
Rym: I would generally, my whole life, I will not drink hot water from a tap.

97
00:05:40,703 --> 00:05:43,060
Scott: You got some weird hang up about water.

98
00:05:43,701 --> 00:05:44,709
Rym: We're in New York City.

99
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:45,980
Scott: This is the best water on earth.

100
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,300
Rym: In London, in fact.

101
00:05:48,183 --> 00:05:50,820
Scott: The water is identical until it gets to this building.

102
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,540
Rym: Yes, and in the building the hot water follows a different path.

103
00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:03,220
Scott: Yes, in the building the hot water goes to a heated place where the same H2O molecules and all the other molecules are excited.

104
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,755
Scott: And then they travel through identical types of pipes.

105
00:06:06,775 --> 00:06:07,820
Scott: Just one of them is insulated.

106
00:06:08,628 --> 00:06:09,839
Scott: And then it gets to the sink.

107
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:14,717
Rym: And the difference in temperature does mean more things depending on exactly what kind of pipes it is.

108
00:06:14,757 --> 00:06:15,480
Rym: We'll leach out of it.

109
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,260
Scott: Yeah, I am not concerned.

110
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,355
Rym: But in London they actually...

111
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,177
Scott: They're not lead pipes.

112
00:06:21,342 --> 00:06:27,420
Rym: From the US government, the Environmental Protection Agency, only use cold water from taps for cooking and drinking.

113
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,889
Rym: Never cook with or drink water from the hot tap.

114
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:30,753
Rym: Full stop.

115
00:06:30,793 --> 00:06:32,360
Rym: That is the official US government advice.

116
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,200
Rym: Hot water dissolves more lead and other materials quickly than water.

117
00:06:36,361 --> 00:06:39,375
Scott: It can't dissolve lead if you don't have lead pipes.

118
00:06:39,435 --> 00:06:40,520
Scott: There's no lead to dissolve.

119
00:06:41,524 --> 00:06:42,839
Rym: What kind of solder is in those pipes?

120
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,687
Scott: What the fuck do I know, but it's not lead.

121
00:06:45,707 --> 00:06:47,697
Scott: They didn't use lead in a building.

122
00:06:47,737 --> 00:06:48,260
Scott: that's this new.

123
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:52,780
Rym: There's also other things that can come out of different types of plastic pipes.

124
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,924
Scott: I mean, if it was an old building... Basically the way I see it is this.

125
00:06:57,085 --> 00:07:01,480
Scott: If the building is old, I'm not drinking any of the water, cold or hot.

126
00:07:02,824 --> 00:07:08,520
Scott: And if the building's new, and the water can be trusted, how much difference is it the hot water making?

127
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:12,395
Scott: Especially... It's not like I'm taking hot water from the sink and drinking it, right?

128
00:07:12,475 --> 00:07:13,439
Scott: It's like, you know.

129
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,504
Rym: Well, I'm just saying.

130
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:22,680
Rym: Not all the US federal government and every state government now that I'm googling around actually makes the same warning as does the government of the United Kingdom.

131
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,060
Scott: Like I don't drink hot water from the sink, right?

132
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:29,940
Rym: I'll occasionally just drink hot water, but even then I get it from my nice water heater.

133
00:07:30,381 --> 00:07:31,124
Scott: Yeah, but it's like.

134
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:36,400
Scott: the only time I would use a hot water in a cooking is, like you said, dehydrate a mushroom.

135
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,859
Scott: In which case, how much water, or rehydrate a mushroom.

136
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:44,740
Scott: Like how much of that water is getting into my body.

137
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:50,040
Rym: Even modern copper piping, according to the EPA, often uses tin-lead solder.

138
00:07:52,561 --> 00:07:52,804
Scott: Okay.

139
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,039
Scott: It's on the outside.

140
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:56,402
Rym: Not 100%.

141
00:07:56,402 --> 00:07:59,400
Rym: I don't think you know how soldering works with pipes anyway.

142
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:00,537
Scott: Okay.

143
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:15,700
Rym: So in some news, somehow the Venture Brothers movie, which is the end of the Venture Brothers because Capitol basically gave up on those two beautiful people who are just crazy enough to keep making this weird show.

144
00:08:17,201 --> 00:08:20,495
Rym: They basically said, "Alright, you can make this movie and then we're done with you.

145
00:08:20,555 --> 00:08:21,378
Rym: You can't keep making this

146
00:08:21,398 --> 00:08:21,599
Rym: show.".

147
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:26,820
Rym: Because you know the history of this show, which I think it's one of the better animated shows ever made in America.

148
00:08:26,981 --> 00:08:27,964
Rym: It's a fantastic show.

149
00:08:28,586 --> 00:08:32,200
Rym: Shockingly good compared to what the first season was.

150
00:08:33,181 --> 00:08:37,299
Rym: Anyone who watched the first season of this would probably not expect it to be a show that would make you cry.

151
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:43,356
Rym: But this is one of my top 20 animated TV series ever, including anime.

152
00:08:43,998 --> 00:08:45,201
Rym: At least top 50.

153
00:08:45,201 --> 00:08:45,723
Rym: It's a good show.

154
00:08:45,763 --> 00:08:46,145
Rym: I like it.

155
00:08:46,305 --> 00:08:49,920
Rym: But the people who make it are kind of crazy about it.

156
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:54,898
Rym: It's not like, "Oh, they make a season and then it takes a year to make the next

157
00:08:54,939 --> 00:08:55,180
Rym: season.".

158
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,580
Rym: This is like, they'll make a season and then it takes them like four years to make another season.

159
00:08:59,861 --> 00:09:01,800
Rym: And then it takes them like another four years to make another season.

160
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,900
Scott: When was the first season?

161
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:07,480
Rym: The first season was, now I gotta go all the way back, I was working at a different company.

162
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,060
Rym: What does Wikipedia say?

163
00:09:09,261 --> 00:09:10,326
Rym: I'm pulling that up right now.

164
00:09:10,969 --> 00:09:13,079
Rym: Because I didn't even start watching it when it first came out.

165
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:21,877
Scott: It started in... There are 81 episodes, 7 seasons, and the first season was...

166
00:09:25,563 --> 00:09:26,981
Rym: Wikipedia says 2003?

167
00:09:26,981 --> 00:09:29,220
Scott: Original release, August 2004.

168
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,508
Rym: It says picture format 2003 to 2006 NTSC.

169
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:38,220
Rym: That's telling you that the picture format from when it was in production was used was NTSC, yes.

170
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,889
Scott: But it says original release 2004.

171
00:09:39,889 --> 00:09:41,720
Scott: That's when it was released.

172
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,801
Scott: I'm sure they worked on it in 2003 for it to be released in 2004.

173
00:09:45,801 --> 00:09:49,753
Rym: So they've made 81 episodes of this show in 20 years.

174
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:59,839
Scott: So in 19 years, they made 7 seasons, so that's about 1 season every 2 and a half to 3 years.

175
00:10:01,043 --> 00:10:01,485
Rym: Yup.

176
00:10:01,646 --> 00:10:04,000
Rym: And 81 episodes because the seasons are not all the same length.

177
00:10:05,406 --> 00:10:05,759
Scott: That's true.

178
00:10:06,501 --> 00:10:08,800
Rym: In fact, the more recent seasons were just like 8 episodes.

179
00:10:11,142 --> 00:10:14,522
Scott: The reason it said 2003, there was a pilot in 2003.

180
00:10:14,522 --> 00:10:15,406
Rym: Ah, that explains it.

181
00:10:15,687 --> 00:10:18,200
Rym: I just hit the same bit of the Wikipedia skimming around.

182
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:18,833
Scott: So yeah.

183
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:19,779
Scott: The first sentence.

184
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:22,189
Rym: This show is great.

185
00:10:22,551 --> 00:10:24,820
Rym: If you never watched it, I'd say it's worth watching.

186
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,700
Rym: Though you could skip the first couple seasons and dive right in and maybe go back to that later.

187
00:10:29,661 --> 00:10:34,480
Scott: I find it interesting that there's two trends that are strange to me.

188
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:42,260
Scott: The first trend is that there's a lot of things where they don't have an ending and they would normally get cancelled.

189
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,619
Scott: But instead, someone's going through the effort to make these ending movies for things.

190
00:10:46,821 --> 00:10:48,859
Scott: Where it used to be an intentional thing.

191
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,040
Scott: That there would be like, we're going to intentionally end with a movie for a big splash.

192
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,340
Scott: Whereas now, it's like, you can't have another season, but we didn't do our ending.

193
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,820
Scott: Okay, you can make a one-shot movie for your ending.

194
00:11:00,482 --> 00:11:02,319
Scott: It feels like that, as opposed to the...

195
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,151
Rym: Oh, it's definitely that.

196
00:11:03,192 --> 00:11:03,740
Rym: This was basically...

197
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,997
Scott: As opposed to end on a movie on purpose.

198
00:11:07,198 --> 00:11:07,480
Scott: Boom!

199
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:14,820
Rym: It's very clear from interviews and from everything I can find about these two that they would just keep making this show forever.

200
00:11:15,345 --> 00:11:16,439
Rym: If anyone would let them.

201
00:11:17,662 --> 00:11:20,058
Rym: And they had planned to make a whole 'nother?

202
00:11:20,098 --> 00:11:20,400
Rym: season.

203
00:11:21,141 --> 00:11:24,520
Rym: And they were finally told, look, you're making one movie and that's it.

204
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,960
Rym: So wrap up whatever you're going to wrap up so the fans don't freak out.

205
00:11:28,243 --> 00:11:29,700
Rym: And that is the end of this train.

206
00:11:30,081 --> 00:11:33,520
Rym: Unless someone else is willing to give you enough money to keep doing this.

207
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:45,880
Scott: Now the second trend that I've noticed that's interesting is that, you know, there's... It seems like, you know, you got the cheap shows that are so cheap but popular enough that they just never end.

208
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,540
Scott: They just keep making more, right?

209
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:52,520
Scott: You got the big, fancy, ultra-popular shows, right?

210
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,553
Scott: That will either go, go, go, but still end soon-ish, right?

211
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:03,600
Scott: Because they need to have so much audience to keep going, right?

212
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,596
Scott: It's like Game of Thrones ain't still going, is it?

213
00:12:05,676 --> 00:12:06,120
Scott: I don't think so.

214
00:12:06,521 --> 00:12:07,184
Rym: No, no.

215
00:12:07,747 --> 00:12:10,940
Rym: Not only is it not still going, but the final season flopped.

216
00:12:12,021 --> 00:12:13,580
Scott: Okay, but the point is, right?

217
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,640
Rym: Wait, you don't know what happened with that show.

218
00:12:17,141 --> 00:12:18,740
Rym: That is a separate topic we should talk about later.

219
00:12:19,461 --> 00:12:20,479
Rym: The shit show.

220
00:12:20,961 --> 00:12:22,360
Scott: I don't care about any Thrones or games.

221
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,520
Rym: The best summary I can give you is the show was popular because of the subject matter.

222
00:12:27,181 --> 00:12:29,780
Rym: And the first season was actually, like, really well put together.

223
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:35,620
Rym: Basically, the people who were in charge of running the show didn't have much experience and didn't fucking know what they were doing.

224
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:38,260
Rym: And just kind of failed to make it good.

225
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,300
Scott: Well, didn't they also run out of book because the guy still hasn't put out of it, right?

226
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,200
Rym: Yeah, but that was not actually the problem.

227
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:49,460
Rym: This is like a big story in entertainment of how badly it failed.

228
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:54,760
Scott: But anyway, the point is that the trend I'm seeing is that there's these mid-shows, right?

229
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,219
Scott: Like your Venture Brothers, where they're not mega-hits.

230
00:12:58,141 --> 00:12:59,700
Rym: The Owl House, same thing happened.

231
00:13:00,265 --> 00:13:00,860
Scott: Good example.

232
00:13:02,183 --> 00:13:02,920
Scott: Perfect example.

233
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,720
Scott: There's these mid-shows.

234
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,480
Scott: They're not mega-popular, earth-shattering, everyone in the world knows them.

235
00:13:08,801 --> 00:13:14,780
Scott: They're not super cheap garbage shows like reality shows or cop shows or laws and orders or whatever, right?

236
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:20,139
Scott: But they're in this mid-tier of popularity where, like, you know, nerds know them.

237
00:13:20,701 --> 00:13:26,640
Scott: And somehow those shows, it's like they're not as cheap as the ultra-cheap shows.

238
00:13:27,081 --> 00:13:35,600
Scott: But they hang around for what seems like longer than their popularity would warrant, right?

239
00:13:36,163 --> 00:13:39,160
Scott: Just based on feeling, not based on numbers, because you don't have all the numbers.

240
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:44,760
Scott: But based on feeling, it's like, how popular does Venture Brothers feel?

241
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,400
Scott: Moderately popular.

242
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,803
Scott: How long has it been going?

243
00:13:47,803 --> 00:13:49,909
Scott: 19 years and 7 seasons.

244
00:13:49,989 --> 00:13:52,015
Scott: Feels like that feeling of 19 years, 17 seasons.

245
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,660
Scott: So as one of the people.

246
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,000
Scott: Feels bigger than the popularity level feels.

247
00:13:57,161 --> 00:13:58,840
Rym: As one of those nerds, like I can say.

248
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,960
Scott: And there are several shows in that range.

249
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:05,740
Rym: Because the way they announced that the movie's actually happening is they just released a clip from it, like, out of nowhere.

250
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,413
Rym: Like, just, it hit YouTube.

251
00:14:07,473 --> 00:14:07,958
Rym: Like, here it is.

252
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:14,860
Rym: And so many people who I know are also fans of this, like, DM'd me on Discord.

253
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:18,034
Rym: Or, like, pinged me like, "Yo, did you see the

254
00:14:18,114 --> 00:14:18,435
Rym: clip?".

255
00:14:21,441 --> 00:14:22,148
Scott: Maybe that's it.

256
00:14:22,168 --> 00:14:23,540
Scott: Maybe that's the mid-tier thing.

257
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,719
Rym: I think the mid-tier thing.

258
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,800
Scott: Extreme fans, even if you don't have many fans.

259
00:14:26,861 --> 00:14:28,860
Rym: I would say it's not even necessarily extreme.

260
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:32,340
Rym: It's more like, because we've talked about this in broader creator circles.

261
00:14:32,841 --> 00:14:38,979
Rym: If you've got a critical mass of followers who believe in your content and like what you do.

262
00:14:40,381 --> 00:14:45,680
Rym: Below a certain tier, that is enough people to sustain you creating what that group wants.

263
00:14:45,841 --> 00:14:48,180
Scott: That's enough to sustain you if you're a webcomic.

264
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,600
Scott: If once you're a TV show, you need to have a certain number.

265
00:14:51,081 --> 00:14:52,520
Scott: Because there's a production cost.

266
00:14:53,082 --> 00:14:56,337
Rym: So I think there is a similar phenomenon for.

267
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,160
Scott: If you're just a band making merch, the number is low.

268
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:02,460
Scott: If you're on actual television, the number is high.

269
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:07,680
Rym: So I suspect there is a similar but distinct phenomenon for shows like Owl House and Venture Brothers.

270
00:15:08,123 --> 00:15:09,920
Rym: Where it's not quite that scenario.

271
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,020
Rym: That audience clearly isn't sustainable to make enough money.

272
00:15:13,302 --> 00:15:15,919
Rym: Or, it might be a capitalism situation, it might be.

273
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:21,240
Rym: It breaks even, maybe it makes money, but it's risky to keep making it.

274
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:25,340
Rym: Because, alright, hang these two idiots another two million dollars and wait four years.

275
00:15:25,844 --> 00:15:27,859
Rym: And then they release eight more episodes of something.

276
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:29,589
Scott: It's two point seven.

277
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:31,100
Scott: five years you'll wait, not four.

278
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:35,800
Rym: Well it depends on, they did every season, like the last season, they just made eight episodes.

279
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,060
Scott: I mean, how many do they need to make?

280
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,060
Scott: One, they make just as much money if they make four or twenty six.

281
00:15:42,403 --> 00:15:43,099
Scott: Why make twenty six?

282
00:15:43,722 --> 00:15:47,280
Rym: I also wouldn't be shocked because they write it based on what the plot is.

283
00:15:47,543 --> 00:15:48,400
Rym: They just tell their story.

284
00:15:48,804 --> 00:15:49,740
Scott: I know, I'm just saying.

285
00:15:50,763 --> 00:15:52,439
Scott: It's not like more episodes makes more money.

286
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:53,340
Rym: True, exactly.

287
00:15:53,941 --> 00:15:58,060
Scott: You just need to maintain enough interest because the money comes from other things.

288
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,639
Scott: You just need to maintain the interest level.

289
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,940
Rym: Owl House had a totally different side story where it was partly Disney.

290
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:11,020
Rym: You know, the whole executives shuffle around and the brand doesn't want that to be part of their offering.

291
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,940
Rym: And it was more one of those situations.

292
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,940
Rym: There's a lot of situations like that that happen.

293
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:17,454
Scott: Anyway.

294
00:16:17,882 --> 00:16:18,638
Rym: Anyway, you got any news?

295
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:20,920
Scott: Uh, what was my news?

296
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:21,539
Rym: The Pokemon thing?

297
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:22,740
Scott: Oh, yeah.

298
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:28,680
Scott: So if you go on the Internet and you will go to popular Pokemon fan sites, you know, Bulbapedia being the number one.

299
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,880
Scott: But there's several others.

300
00:16:30,183 --> 00:16:31,900
Scott: And you look at pictures of old Pokemon.

301
00:16:34,061 --> 00:16:36,360
Scott: Especially the original two hundred and fifty one Pokemon.

302
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,078
Scott: The real Pokemon.

303
00:16:38,942 --> 00:16:40,759
Scott: There's going to be like these JPEGs of them.

304
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,919
Scott: You know, drawings of Pokemon and the official drawings that you're going to see.

305
00:16:45,603 --> 00:16:47,820
Scott: And you're going to see the same ones like on every website.

306
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:54,596
Scott: Because like one person way back in the day had like, I don't know, a Nintendo Power magazine or some art book or something in the late 90s, early 2000s.

307
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:59,939
Scott: And they scanned in all the Pokemon pics right as JPEGs.

308
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,080
Rym: And I feel like those same JPEGs have just been passed around the Internet since then.

309
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,960
Scott: One person scanned in the JPEGs and then every other person Google search found those JPEGs.

310
00:17:08,642 --> 00:17:10,800
Scott: And there was no reason for them to scan the JPEG.

311
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:16,700
Scott: So the same JPEGs have just been going around the Internet on every Pokemon fan site.

312
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:17,401
Scott: Right.

313
00:17:17,502 --> 00:17:18,878
Scott: Since who knows what year.

314
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:19,421
Scott: Right.

315
00:17:19,882 --> 00:17:28,079
Scott: And all of these, like the original official Pokemon drawings of the original 251 by Ken Sugimori, who's the original artist for those Pokemon.

316
00:17:29,321 --> 00:17:39,580
Scott: And it turns out somewhat obviously that whoever scanned those in wasn't like some, you know, great artist to scanner X imaging expert.

317
00:17:39,922 --> 00:17:40,124
Scott: Right.

318
00:17:40,164 --> 00:17:42,600
Scott: It's like they just slap their book on the scanner.

319
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:43,360
Scott: Right.

320
00:17:43,441 --> 00:17:45,610
Scott: Pressed it down and push scan and then cropped it.

321
00:17:45,751 --> 00:17:46,012
Scott: Done.

322
00:17:46,996 --> 00:17:47,760
Scott: Pushed auto scan.

323
00:17:48,602 --> 00:17:52,260
Scott: And as a result, those JPEGs actually don't look great.

324
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,303
Scott: Like they're.

325
00:17:53,524 --> 00:17:57,680
Scott: even if you got the originals that were first uploaded, the colors are wrong.

326
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,547
Rym: The colors are like way wrong.

327
00:17:59,607 --> 00:18:02,500
Rym: Like there's a reason why you keep seeing this blue Bulbasaur everywhere.

328
00:18:03,321 --> 00:18:03,582
Scott: Yeah.

329
00:18:03,602 --> 00:18:04,565
Scott: It's like they're way wrong.

330
00:18:04,726 --> 00:18:08,700
Scott: The books, you know, it's like if you want to really scan a book, you got to tear the pages out.

331
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,042
Scott: Right.

332
00:18:09,082 --> 00:18:11,132
Scott: You can't have the book bent in the edge.

333
00:18:11,213 --> 00:18:11,333
Scott: Right.

334
00:18:11,353 --> 00:18:12,660
Scott: Because then it warps the image.

335
00:18:13,381 --> 00:18:14,567
Scott: Basically, they're all wrong.

336
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,880
Scott: So some extreme nerds.

337
00:18:17,501 --> 00:18:17,722
Scott: Right.

338
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:20,980
Scott: The good kind of extreme nerd who are super Pokemon fans.

339
00:18:21,241 --> 00:18:21,502
Scott: Right.

340
00:18:22,647 --> 00:18:25,840
Scott: They went out and they're like, hey, I'm tired of looking at these images that are wrong.

341
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,884
Scott: I got the art book here.

342
00:18:26,904 --> 00:18:27,467
Scott: Right.

343
00:18:27,487 --> 00:18:28,451
Scott: I got the real images.

344
00:18:28,893 --> 00:18:30,620
Scott: I'm rescanning this shit properly.

345
00:18:31,102 --> 00:18:33,514
Scott: And they, you know, with modern scanning equipment, too.

346
00:18:33,534 --> 00:18:34,399
Scott: That's also part of it.

347
00:18:34,439 --> 00:18:34,580
Scott: Right.

348
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,532
Scott: 20 years of advances in technology.

349
00:18:37,994 --> 00:18:38,175
Rym: Yeah.

350
00:18:38,215 --> 00:18:39,340
Rym: This ain't the Kano scan.

351
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:40,521
Scott: Right.

352
00:18:40,562 --> 00:18:40,823
Scott: Yeah.

353
00:18:40,883 --> 00:18:43,256
Scott: Well, I mean, you could buy a new Kano scan.

354
00:18:43,276 --> 00:18:43,860
Scott: That's really good.

355
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:47,075
Rym: From what I've so total aside, I was looking to get the new scanner.

356
00:18:47,115 --> 00:18:48,020
Rym: from all the reviews I read.

357
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:51,239
Rym: Everyone said that the new Kano scans aren't better than like the ancient ones.

358
00:18:51,901 --> 00:18:57,439
Scott: I mean, really, the only reason to get a scanner today is like documents you get.

359
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,236
Scott: And if you want documents, you can just get the shittiest.

360
00:19:00,357 --> 00:19:00,780
Rym: Oh, you know what?

361
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:07,620
Rym: The Kano scan we use, our Kano scan takes a USB A on one end and a USB B on the other hand.

362
00:19:08,001 --> 00:19:08,141
Scott: Yeah.

363
00:19:08,162 --> 00:19:12,944
Scott: There is no reason to get a high res fancy scanner if you're just doing documents, because you want to not.

364
00:19:13,024 --> 00:19:16,040
Scott: you want to have PDFs and get rid of everything and recycle everything.

365
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:16,301
Scott: Right.

366
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:16,642
Scott: Shred it.

367
00:19:17,165 --> 00:19:20,000
Scott: But if you want a fancy scan, the only reason would be photos.

368
00:19:20,281 --> 00:19:20,441
Scott: Right.

369
00:19:20,461 --> 00:19:26,280
Scott: You got negatives, hopefully, or you've got prints and you want to scan those and get them to be high res.

370
00:19:26,802 --> 00:19:31,580
Scott: Then you can enter the world of real scanners and I have an Epson that's still very good.

371
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,826
Scott: They make, you know, some high end ones.

372
00:19:34,328 --> 00:19:39,604
Scott: Anyway, the point is someone scanned in the images properly and they're.

373
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:49,100
Scott: they're going through this big effort of not just scanning them and uploading them, you know, to the to the major fan sites that, of course, are totally on board with this and happy about it.

374
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:59,180
Scott: But also like going around to other trying to like spread the word to get other people to update their images on their websites to, you know, the correct.

375
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:11,160
Rym: So scrolling through this Twitter thread, the person who is posting has a note about how a bunch of insane nerds were screaming at them for erasing history by trying to replace the original images they know and love with these.

376
00:20:11,681 --> 00:20:24,139
Scott: I'm sure I'm sure some, you know, because these images of these bad images have probably been on the Internet longer than some people have been a lot like how there's a lot of people who have weird nostalgia for like the terrible dub of an old anime.

377
00:20:24,439 --> 00:20:25,120
Rym: that isn't even right.

378
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:25,541
Scott: It's like.

379
00:20:25,561 --> 00:20:32,116
Scott: I'm sure somebody is out there and has seen like the poorly scanned, you know, and they're like, no, I don't care.

380
00:20:32,136 --> 00:20:33,680
Rym: That's what Diglett really looks like.

381
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,001
Rym: Right.

382
00:20:34,021 --> 00:20:39,480
Scott: It's like they've seen that poorly scanned Dragonite their whole life and they're used to it and they're like, don't change it.

383
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,462
Scott: And it's like, well, too bad.

384
00:20:40,902 --> 00:20:44,969
Scott: And then it's like erasing the fact these old images from the Internet.

385
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:46,432
Scott: It's like, I actually agree with that.

386
00:20:46,492 --> 00:20:46,692
Scott: Right.

387
00:20:46,772 --> 00:20:47,253
Scott: Preserve.

388
00:20:47,433 --> 00:20:51,320
Scott: You know, it's like it's still a notable thing to be preserved as an example.

389
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,181
Scott: Right.

390
00:20:52,441 --> 00:20:58,954
Scott: Sort of like how we have the dirty tile on the ceiling in Grand Central, but they're not erasing the old ones.

391
00:20:59,015 --> 00:21:00,097
Scott: They'll still be out there.

392
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:01,620
Scott: There's no way to get rid of the.

393
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:03,483
Scott: Right.

394
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:06,631
Scott: It's it would probably be difficult to get rid of all the old bad scans.

395
00:21:06,751 --> 00:21:06,972
Scott: Right.

396
00:21:07,293 --> 00:21:09,980
Rym: So so this is this is cool.

397
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,522
Rym: Like this is really cool.

398
00:21:11,542 --> 00:21:12,544
Rym: Yeah.

399
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:14,007
Rym: One last little news.

400
00:21:14,267 --> 00:21:20,519
Rym: If you haven't had a chance to see Makoto Shinkai's latest movie, Suzume, it's still in theaters, at least in like.

401
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:20,980
Scott: Oh, it is.

402
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:21,220
Rym: Yeah.

403
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,865
Rym: Until like at least next Tuesday.

404
00:21:23,146 --> 00:21:24,731
Rym: It looks like there's even more screenings later.

405
00:21:24,911 --> 00:21:26,376
Rym: Like it's just fully in theaters.

406
00:21:26,797 --> 00:21:27,820
Rym: It's in a ton of theaters.

407
00:21:28,301 --> 00:21:30,346
Rym: But Scott saw it.

408
00:21:30,407 --> 00:21:31,209
Rym: Emily are going to see it.

409
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:32,572
Scott: So I saw it at the premiere.

410
00:21:32,612 --> 00:21:33,936
Scott: Makoto Shinkai was there.

411
00:21:34,277 --> 00:21:35,059
Scott: Well, the U.S.

412
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:35,319
Scott: for me.

413
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,503
Rym: Yeah.

414
00:21:36,663 --> 00:21:38,649
Rym: Seems like it looks from what people are saying.

415
00:21:38,689 --> 00:21:42,580
Rym: It's a Makoto Shinkai movie and I look forward to it is a Makoto Shinkai movie.

416
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,884
Scott: There's no question about that.

417
00:21:43,944 --> 00:21:49,620
Rym: It'll be easy to do a a traditional GeekNights Wednesday review of this.

418
00:21:50,221 --> 00:21:51,749
Scott: We could have done a Wednesday show on it.

419
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:53,940
Scott: But today, if you had only seen it, I was too busy.

420
00:21:54,201 --> 00:22:01,140
Rym: I literally our household was actually too busy to see it on any of the screening dates until like later this week or maybe like Monday or Tuesday.

421
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,003
Rym: We might have to go see it.

422
00:22:03,247 --> 00:22:04,111
Rym: It's got stuff going on.

423
00:22:04,773 --> 00:22:06,620
Rym: But there's a minor.

424
00:22:07,461 --> 00:22:13,280
Rym: Well, there's a controversy around the movie and you've seen some talk about it, especially in some LGBT forums.

425
00:22:13,681 --> 00:22:15,264
Rym: I'll link to a couple of articles about it.

426
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:21,520
Rym: But basically, there's talk from Shinkai in at least one interview.

427
00:22:21,901 --> 00:22:22,723
Rym: And I see text.

428
00:22:23,043 --> 00:22:23,324
Rym: I'm not.

429
00:22:23,645 --> 00:22:30,540
Rym: I've seen two different versions of this text and I'm not sure if they are just people summarizing translations differently or if it is.

430
00:22:32,122 --> 00:22:42,280
Scott: Also, when we were at the premiere and he was there, he was asked similar related questions and he did not mention or at least the trend through the translator.

431
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:42,942
Scott: Right.

432
00:22:43,544 --> 00:22:45,772
Scott: He did not mention any of this at that time.

433
00:22:45,893 --> 00:22:47,760
Scott: So this was from some other interview.

434
00:22:48,522 --> 00:22:56,080
Rym: And it's making some waves like several people we know actually don't want to see the movie now because of this news, like it's there's a lot of chatter about it.

435
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:06,760
Rym: But the talk is that the original movie was going to be pretty much the same movie, except one of the main characters, the ostensible love interest.

436
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,563
Rym: But not really.

437
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:09,268
Rym: Don't don't worry about the details.

438
00:23:09,288 --> 00:23:12,800
Rym: Not really was originally intended to be a girl.

439
00:23:13,261 --> 00:23:19,160
Rym: And depending on these translations, it was either, quote, a sisterhood type of romantic story.

440
00:23:20,081 --> 00:23:34,240
Rym: I saw another translation of an interview that said a sapphic story, one that said a sorority girl romance or and one of them just says like a sorority fraternity, like coming of age friendship.

441
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:43,180
Rym: I've seen all these different translations and they all have Makoto Shinkai basically responding, saying something to the effect of I wanted this character to be a girl.

442
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:46,266
Rym: I didn't really want to have a lot of romance in the movie.

443
00:23:46,627 --> 00:23:51,760
Rym: I was basically told by the producers I had to make it a boy meets girl romance because that's the brand.

444
00:23:53,441 --> 00:23:54,429
Rym: And that's what.

445
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:55,680
Rym: that's what the movie became.

446
00:23:57,261 --> 00:24:09,320
Scott: What he what he said, at least what the translator said when I was there and he was in the same room that I was right, is that he was tired of doing his usual clouds and romance deal.

447
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,344
Rym: Well, not even clouds and romance.

448
00:24:11,385 --> 00:24:12,027
Rym: It's clouds.

449
00:24:12,267 --> 00:24:13,551
Rym: and will this?

450
00:24:13,792 --> 00:24:16,400
Rym: these two titular characters meet each other?

451
00:24:16,681 --> 00:24:17,685
Scott: That's but I'm not.

452
00:24:17,705 --> 00:24:21,720
Scott: I'm telling you what he said, not what you describe his genre as he said.

453
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:22,581
Scott: Right.

454
00:24:22,622 --> 00:24:27,440
Scott: The translator said he wanted to get away from his clouds and romance, usual shtick.

455
00:24:28,001 --> 00:24:28,341
Scott: Right.

456
00:24:28,923 --> 00:24:35,660
Scott: And that his bosses at the studio were like, you know, but that's what sells.

457
00:24:35,881 --> 00:24:36,806
Scott: We're making money here.

458
00:24:36,826 --> 00:24:37,449
Scott: Right.

459
00:24:37,489 --> 00:24:39,520
Scott: You still have to include that to some extent.

460
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:46,120
Scott: And so in a movie that is the least that of any Shinkai movie.

461
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:46,560
Scott: Right.

462
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:50,391
Scott: You sort of get the feeling from watching this movie that like it's it's not about.

463
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:53,960
Scott: that's like, is there a romance and clouds and skies in the movie?

464
00:24:54,341 --> 00:24:55,045
Scott: Yes, there is.

465
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:56,110
Scott: There is enough.

466
00:24:56,171 --> 00:24:57,940
Scott: there is that you go, ah, this is a Shinkai movie.

467
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,310
Scott: Look at those clouds and romance.

468
00:24:59,330 --> 00:24:59,854
Scott: They are there.

469
00:24:59,976 --> 00:25:00,419
Scott: I see them.

470
00:25:00,741 --> 00:25:00,981
Scott: Right.

471
00:25:01,422 --> 00:25:03,829
Scott: But it is not about that.

472
00:25:03,929 --> 00:25:05,574
Scott: It's just sort of like they're.

473
00:25:05,614 --> 00:25:07,700
Scott: they're like they're a part of the setting, I guess.

474
00:25:08,482 --> 00:25:13,640
Scott: And, you know, he put them there because that's, you know, what they told him to do.

475
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:20,440
Scott: You know, he also said some other interesting things, but we could save them for a show, you know, about the movie.

476
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,460
Scott: But regardless, he didn't say anything about any of that other stuff.

477
00:25:24,963 --> 00:25:26,740
Scott: So the translator didn't say anything.

478
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,111
Rym: So what is translated in this interview is hit.

479
00:25:29,433 --> 00:25:30,880
Rym: Makoto Shinkai's words are quote.

480
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:35,639
Rym: At first, I wanted to turn this story into a movie about Suzume and another girl journeying.

481
00:25:36,141 --> 00:25:42,500
Rym: Why I even wanted to go in that direction in the first place is because I personally felt a little bit tired of telling the very traditional romance story.

482
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:46,240
Scott: I felt that I did say he was tired of telling the traditional story.

483
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:53,000
Rym: I felt that in your name, I did everything that I possibly could in terms of boy meets girl or will they, won't they, will they meet?

484
00:25:53,861 --> 00:25:58,280
Rym: That element of romance is very relatable to the masses, which is why it was subject matter that resonated with the target audience.

485
00:26:00,163 --> 00:26:01,087
Rym: In order, he.

486
00:26:01,128 --> 00:26:03,639
Rym: basically then, there's a bunch of text here I got to skip over.

487
00:26:04,821 --> 00:26:08,360
Rym: He said that he characterized the pitch as quote.

488
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:13,020
Rym: This is a movie about a sisterhood style type of romantic story.

489
00:26:14,421 --> 00:26:18,513
Rym: And the producer persuaded me to make another your name style.

490
00:26:18,553 --> 00:26:21,020
Rym: boy meets girl romance because of audience expectations.

491
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:28,840
Rym: And then the kicker quote, in order to not make too much of a romance, I decided to make the primary interest a chair period.

492
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:39,460
Rym: So I'm going to see, once I see the movie, I'm sure there'll be more commentary on this because these interviews that I'm quoting from were posted only in the last week.

493
00:26:39,941 --> 00:26:41,970
Rym: And we'll review the movie and probably have a lot more to say.

494
00:26:42,311 --> 00:26:43,436
Rym: Scott seems to have a lot to say.

495
00:26:43,456 --> 00:26:44,440
Rym: I expect I will too.

496
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:51,399
Scott: I mean, the thing is, it's like, you know, if there's a, if there's a meta reason that he went with the chair story, right.

497
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,282
Scott: Then, I mean, there is,

498
00:26:53,502 --> 00:26:54,643
Rym: I think I trust that,

499
00:26:55,384 --> 00:27:09,180
Scott: but at the same time, you know, it's like, you know, you see the chair thing seems ridiculous, but in the, it's like you could actually, if he didn't say anything about it, you could totally believe that like the chair was the first idea.

500
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:16,218
Rym: Well, meta reason, there's robots in Evangelion for a bunch of meta reasons around selling a show, but yet what's it actually about?

501
00:27:16,258 --> 00:27:17,120
Rym: and do the robots work?

502
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,869
Rym: Eska Flonay, meta reasons.

503
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:19,775
Rym: Oh, it's a mecha show.

504
00:27:19,916 --> 00:27:20,439
Rym: Actually, no.

505
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:22,400
Scott: Right.

506
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:35,680
Scott: So, yeah, you could, you could have told me that like you started with the chair thing and everything else came afterwards, which is obviously not the case because we know additional meta information, but the chair works.

507
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:45,180
Scott: Like, even if it was, even if the genders of the characters were all mixed up, it's like, I feel like the movie would just wouldn't have worked if the person didn't turn into a chair.

508
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,305
Rym: You know, that's relevant because in this interview, he said one final thing.

509
00:27:48,646 --> 00:27:56,260
Rym: I think, quoting him again, through a translator, of course, I think it would also work had Susan May been a boy or had she been non-binary.

510
00:27:56,721 --> 00:27:59,024
Rym: It's not necessarily the context of male, female.

511
00:27:59,305 --> 00:28:03,331
Rym: It's about a human overcoming something in my future films as well.

512
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:08,780
Rym: I want to focus on that human story as opposed to too much romance or commentary on gender or sex.

513
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:19,740
Scott: Yes, they're really, yeah, it really doesn't, the genders of the characters, except for, I think, you know, gender only comes into it like maybe with like some side characters, right?

514
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:28,080
Scott: It's like, they're just, it's, it's really about, you know, it's, it's, it's not about the, the romance, like there's, I don't even think there's any fucking kissing in this movie.

515
00:28:28,901 --> 00:28:32,235
Scott: If I remember, not, oh, there sort of is, actually.

516
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:33,500
Scott: Time.

517
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:37,124
Scott: But anyway, things of the day.

518
00:28:37,525 --> 00:28:38,487
Rym: I just bumped into this.

519
00:28:38,547 --> 00:28:46,240
Rym: YouTube Music recommended it to me because I listen to a lot of DJs and a lot of remixes and sample type stuff on YouTube Music.

520
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,009
Rym: It's just like, that's the kind of music I listen to lately.

521
00:28:48,652 --> 00:28:50,060
Rym: And what it recommended was a video.

522
00:28:51,601 --> 00:29:00,260
Rym: And it was just called "60s, 70s Japanese Instrumental Cinema Funk Breaks and Beats" from an account called Tripmaster.

523
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:06,979
Rym: And the title in the thumbnail was "Knocksteady Zencast Volume

524
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:08,322
Rym: 2.".

525
00:29:08,322 --> 00:29:10,413
Rym: And this is my fucking jam.

526
00:29:10,474 --> 00:29:11,298
Rym: That's all I got to say.

527
00:29:12,841 --> 00:29:22,820
Rym: Listen, this is 45 minutes of some fantastic funky beats that'll make you want to get your Zatoichi or your Samurai nonsense going in a big way.

528
00:29:25,141 --> 00:29:28,569
Scott: So, I mean, that seems to be like everyone's, right?

529
00:29:28,629 --> 00:29:33,040
Scott: I mean, you know, if it wasn't for, you know, Samurai Champloo, right?

530
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,469
Scott: It's like, would we have lo-fi beats to study too?

531
00:29:35,509 --> 00:29:36,071
Scott: Probably not.

532
00:29:37,677 --> 00:29:38,320
Scott: I don't think we would.

533
00:29:39,141 --> 00:29:42,473
Rym: And the DJ who put this together is very, like, point to the stands.

534
00:29:42,674 --> 00:29:44,280
Rym: This is all killer, no filler.

535
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:47,213
Scott: I like all killers.

536
00:29:47,253 --> 00:29:48,199
Scott: That's how everything should be.

537
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:55,599
Scott: Alright, so, there's, you know, there's the original Matt Cross TV series, which is as old as we are.

538
00:29:55,900 --> 00:30:02,080
Scott: And then there's the compilation movie "Do You Remember Love," which, you know, fans fucking love the shit out of that movie.

539
00:30:02,321 --> 00:30:07,440
Scott: Even though for me, it's like, yeah, it's good, but it's still, I'd rather watch a TV show because it's still a compilation movie.

540
00:30:09,442 --> 00:30:12,599
Scott: Even though it's animated nicely and whatever, it has an extra song and whatnot.

541
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:20,560
Scott: But anyway, they, you know, a while ago, for the 30th anniversary of Matt Cross, right?

542
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,827
Scott: Which I think was maybe 10 years ago, I think.

543
00:30:22,847 --> 00:30:26,620
Scott: You know, because it should be 40 years old now, I think.

544
00:30:27,181 --> 00:30:30,416
Scott: Oh no, but the movie is newer, so it's less than 10 years.

545
00:30:30,456 --> 00:30:31,320
Scott: I forget exactly when.

546
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:38,520
Scott: Anyway, for the 30th anniversary of the movie, there was a Blu-ray Super HD remaster deal, right?

547
00:30:39,321 --> 00:30:43,272
Scott: And they made a documentary to promote the Blu-ray.

548
00:30:43,292 --> 00:30:45,860
Scott: that was an hour-long TV special.

549
00:30:46,141 --> 00:30:55,460
Scott: They also put a documentary on the Blu-ray, but the documentary on the Blu-ray was different, slightly at least, from the documentary that was on TV just once.

550
00:30:55,881 --> 00:31:00,760
Scott: But of course, some nerd recorded the one-hour documentary that was on TV just once.

551
00:31:01,521 --> 00:31:06,837
Scott: And put it on YouTube with subtitles that give you the vibe of VHS subtitles from the 90s.

552
00:31:07,961 --> 00:31:12,639
Rym: I mean, right in the beginning, immediately, it's got a warning, "For private use only, unofficial fan

553
00:31:12,659 --> 00:31:12,740
Rym: sub.".

554
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:18,796
Scott: So you might want to use your, you know, this is on YouTube, it's been there for seven months, it hasn't been taken down, but it only has 872 views.

555
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:25,000
Scott: You might want to use your YouTube downloaders to download this, you know, thing, just in case.

556
00:31:25,921 --> 00:31:38,726
Scott: But yeah, if you want to watch a documentary about, you know, the people who made Macross, some of whom I think may have passed away since this documentary was made, if I'm, maybe?

557
00:31:38,746 --> 00:31:42,160
Scott: I have to remember exactly when, the timing of things.

558
00:31:42,962 --> 00:31:48,500
Scott: But, you know, I didn't watch it yet, but it's like, do I even need to, to know that this is Thing of the Day?

559
00:31:48,881 --> 00:31:49,649
Scott: No, no I don't.

560
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,897
Rym: Definitely this is top tier stuff right here.

561
00:31:53,589 --> 00:31:53,760
Scott: Right.

562
00:31:54,523 --> 00:32:00,220
Rym: In the meta moment, the GeekNights Book Club book, which will very likely- I finished reading a while ago already.

563
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:05,600
Rym: I'm steamrolling through it, and I think next week on Thursday we could very likely do the show.

564
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:16,780
Rym: The odds are low that we won't do this show next Thursday, but if we don't do it next Thursday, then the following Thursday, sometime before then we'll have recorded it, because it's a pretty good book.

565
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,047
Scott: You gotta start going to the library.

566
00:32:18,107 --> 00:32:20,420
Scott: like me, you'd get it done in a month no matter what.

567
00:32:20,801 --> 00:32:21,344
Rym: I was just busy.

568
00:32:21,364 --> 00:32:23,252
Rym: I got stuff going on.

569
00:32:24,096 --> 00:32:25,040
Rym: Got projects, got things.

570
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:28,377
Scott: Doesn't matter how busy you are, if you gotta return the library book, you gotta read it.

571
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,298
Rym: I probably would have just extended it.

572
00:32:31,961 --> 00:32:35,360
Scott: I don't know how many extensions they let you have, I think if there's someone waiting you don't get an extension.

573
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,240
Scott: I don't know how it works at all actually.

574
00:32:37,361 --> 00:32:38,340
Rym: I have no idea, I bought it.

575
00:32:38,962 --> 00:32:39,879
Scott: I'm completely guessing.

576
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:45,629
Rym: But otherwise, we got no conventions coming up for a while.

577
00:32:45,829 --> 00:32:50,960
Rym: Me and Emily are gonna be at a Star Trek Con hanging out in Philly sometime soon.

578
00:32:51,741 --> 00:32:55,597
Rym: D&I Con, but otherwise, that's not a GeekNights con, that's just us.

579
00:32:55,617 --> 00:32:56,460
Rym: Diversity and inclusion.

580
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,060
Scott: Okay, but what does that have to do with Star Trek though?

581
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:05,219
Rym: Because it's a super LGBT and POC friendly Star Trek convention.

582
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,020
Scott: But there's no Star Trek-ness in the name of the convention?

583
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:11,356
Rym: I think there's more name to it than just that.

584
00:33:11,416 --> 00:33:12,220
Rym: I don't know the whole story.

585
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,689
Rym: I think it's a new con.

586
00:33:14,193 --> 00:33:14,919
Scott: I'm not coordinating.

587
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,640
Scott: That could be any con, right?

588
00:33:18,063 --> 00:33:20,954
Rym: When I first heard the name of it, I thought, do not interact con?

589
00:33:21,577 --> 00:33:22,340
Rym: What happens there?

590
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,559
Rym: That's like the opposite of the pleasure dome.

591
00:33:26,301 --> 00:33:30,280
Scott: But the next GeekNights- It's Galactic Diversity and Inclusion convention.

592
00:33:30,781 --> 00:33:33,784
Rym: Ah, I didn't even know the G was on there because in the Discord- It's not.

593
00:33:33,805 --> 00:33:36,018
Scott: If you look at the top left of the website, it just says D&I Con.

594
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:41,100
Scott: But if you look in the middle of the website, in giant text, it says Galactic Diversity and Inclusion convention.

595
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:58,920
Rym: All I'm going to say about this con is if you like GeekNights, go to PAXes and MAGFests and cons like that, and you're used to conventions where the websites tell you things, it's easy to forget what most fan conventions are like outside of these very rare gems.

596
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:04,240
Scott: No, it's not because we see most fan conventions reflected in the media, like Simpsons episodes.

597
00:34:05,621 --> 00:34:12,639
Rym: I'm talking about in terms of like, I look at that website and I'm not sure exactly how it's going to go down, and we'll see what it's like.

598
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,360
Scott: There will be a vendor hall, there might be an artist alley.

599
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:22,560
Rym: No, there's like events you have to pay extra for to go to, but there's no information on like- Those are usually like autographed meet famous people.

600
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:29,978
Rym: They are, but there's no information in the schedule on like what time they occur, and some of them don't even say what day they're on.

601
00:34:31,121 --> 00:34:34,860
Rym: It's one of those, a lot of cons, the websites just don't have all the info, and we'll see.

602
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,340
Scott: It looks like a pretty fancy website, it's better than our current website.

603
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,079
Rym: Oh yeah, well because you're working on that.

604
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:49,120
Rym: Our website very much looks like web 2.0.1, like early days of web 2.0.

605
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:57,979
Scott: But the first GeekNights- It's still pretty busted, but the new website can be seen at beta.frontrowcrew.com, and it has a search that's, you know, fast.

606
00:34:58,581 --> 00:35:03,380
Scott: But obviously it won't be searching newer content than when I loaded content into it.

607
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:06,319
Scott: So you might, you're not going to get, like this episode won't be on there.

608
00:35:06,881 --> 00:35:10,920
Rym: But our next GeekNights panel convention will very likely be PEX West.

609
00:35:12,802 --> 00:35:17,360
Rym: I expect to return to MagFest, of course we'll be at PEX Unplugged, unless something- We'll see what happens at MagFest.

610
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,019
Rym: Terrible happens, I'm definitely going to MagFest this coming year.

611
00:35:21,281 --> 00:35:28,900
Rym: The only reason I didn't go last year is because of the masking and the boo-bans, and the year before because of the boo-bans, and the year before because of the boo-bans.

612
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,000
Rym: I don't think it's going to happen that year.

613
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:32,539
Scott: I'm just saying, we'll see what happens to MagFest.

614
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,998
Rym: Seems like it's going to happen for TBD.

615
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:43,260
Rym: Otherwise, let's get right into it, because this is sort of a semi-meta episode, in that we realized something profound.

616
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,998
Scott: It's a completely meta episode, not semi.

617
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:45,729
Rym: Now we did news.

618
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:49,860
Scott: It's also a completely cod-filed episode, because you got no ideas.

619
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:50,619
Rym: We did news.

620
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,100
Scott: But that's also part of the meta.

621
00:35:52,340 --> 00:36:01,620
Rym: And things of the day, and all that other shit, but basically, we realized something, because we skipped a bunch of Wednesday episodes, just kind of recently, the last several months.

622
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,380
Rym: Partly just randomly, a random thing would happen on a Wednesday and we couldn't do a show.

623
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,540
Rym: It wasn't just Wednesdays we would skip.

624
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:13,180
Scott: It was also the hardest day to have show ideas for, by far.

625
00:36:13,461 --> 00:36:19,540
Rym: But we started to think about, why is it the hardest day, and I realized something.

626
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:24,300
Scott: Because we go through seasons of not watching anything, or we don't watch the same stuff.

627
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,460
Scott: And we can't do an episode if we don't watch or read the same thing.

628
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,320
Rym: But there's more to it than that, because there's even a more fundamental level.

629
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:47,660
Rym: Mondays, science and technology, like Scott and I are computer and technology professionals, so there's a lot of, even though we struggle to come up with Monday shows too, at least we have like a, we can try to teach you something, we can talk about a topic where we have some nominal amount of professional expertise.

630
00:36:48,541 --> 00:36:52,700
Scott: We are experts, we do, whatever Monday is about is a thing that we do.

631
00:36:53,220 --> 00:37:09,280
Scott: We're actively involved in technology, and I think perhaps that shows, and that the Monday episodes are super popular compared to the other ones, even though we mostly go to PAX, we don't go to tech conferences, but yet the Monday show is more popular.

632
00:37:09,882 --> 00:37:14,800
Scott: Because our technical expertise is, you know, the highest, because that's what we actually do for work.

633
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:24,420
Rym: We did get a suggestion in the live stream for what to turn Wednesday into, and they said, Wednesday should be, every other week, a tech news roundup.

634
00:37:25,761 --> 00:37:26,162
Scott: Okay.

635
00:37:27,226 --> 00:37:27,848
Rym: Well, perhaps

636
00:37:27,888 --> 00:37:42,720
Scott: that listener is evidence of what I just said, and that they'd like the Monday more, because that's a better, our quality might be, I don't think our quality is high on any day, but the listener might believe that our quality is higher on Monday, because our knowledge is higher on Monday.

637
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,033
Rym: The other suggestion we got was make Wednesday food.

638
00:37:45,697 --> 00:37:46,120
Rym: Just food.

639
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:46,600
Scott: Okay.

640
00:37:47,042 --> 00:37:47,380
Scott: But anyway.

641
00:37:47,681 --> 00:37:48,740
Scott: We're not experts on that.

642
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:53,112
Rym: So Monday, we are professionals, like our day.

643
00:37:53,152 --> 00:37:55,740
Rym: jobs are that, our hobbies are also that.

644
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,459
Scott: I have a degree in that.

645
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:01,580
Rym: Yep, we both have professional degrees from a real university in that.

646
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:12,620
Rym: Tuesdays, we are at the bottom tier of professionals in that technically we get comped on badges and compensated in tiny ways.

647
00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:15,000
Rym: Like, we are like the bottom tier of professionals.

648
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,340
Scott: Right, but we've never published a game ever.

649
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:23,900
Rym: I am attached in a tangential way to two game studios in a formal investment capacity.

650
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:31,720
Rym: But we give talks, people seem to respect our opinions in this industry more so than we ever expected they would.

651
00:38:32,362 --> 00:38:36,577
Scott: And also- We put effort into studying just of our own will.

652
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:37,469
Scott: Yep.

653
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,700
Scott: Like on purpose, right?

654
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:45,780
Scott: We're studying and learning, so it's like I don't have a degree, but I'm on purpose for pure enjoyment, right?

655
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:50,740
Scott: Learning and studying both by playing and reading and watching and et cetera.

656
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,751
Rym: And we have been doing this, not even just playing games, like then.

657
00:38:53,791 --> 00:38:56,360
Rym: that goes back to like when I was three, sitting in front of the Atari.

658
00:38:56,681 --> 00:39:06,959
Rym: But we were like reading about game theory and like getting sweaty and trying hard to understand mechanics of the first urban board games we played for more than 20 years.

659
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:09,800
Rym: Like we've been seriously pursuing this as a hobby.

660
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:14,313
Rym: So if Mondays we are legit professionals, Tuesdays we're prosumer.

661
00:39:14,594 --> 00:39:16,600
Rym: We are prosumer game industry people.

662
00:39:17,282 --> 00:39:17,443
Scott: Right.

663
00:39:17,483 --> 00:39:22,380
Scott: We have a significant above base level knowledge, right?

664
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:34,720
Scott: If you're just the average person who enjoys playing games, we have knowledges and things to say that they probably have not heard and might be interested to hear through all of our learning that we have done.

665
00:39:35,141 --> 00:39:46,860
Rym: Another common thread between Mondays and Tuesdays is a lot of what we talk about are active pursuits of things or interactive things as opposed to the pure consumption of one way media.

666
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:47,521
Rym: We'll get to that.

667
00:39:48,043 --> 00:39:49,847
Rym: Skip Wednesday, talk about Thursday.

668
00:39:50,449 --> 00:39:51,612
Rym: Thursday is the anything show.

669
00:39:51,652 --> 00:39:54,660
Rym: It's whatever doesn't fit in any other category and we talk about a ton of different stuff.

670
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:57,806
Scott: But the point is, you know, we're starved for Thursday ideas as well.

671
00:39:57,927 --> 00:40:02,275
Scott: But if we do come up with a Thursday idea, it's the fact that we came up with.

672
00:40:02,335 --> 00:40:04,600
Scott: it means it was something that was on our minds.

673
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,644
Scott: It's something we have something to say about.

674
00:40:07,165 --> 00:40:10,070
Scott: And so the content should be good, I guess.

675
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:12,454
Scott: But is it really good?

676
00:40:12,554 --> 00:40:15,720
Scott: Because I don't know how Thursday is listening.

677
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,164
Rym: We'll say it's good in terms of.

678
00:40:17,204 --> 00:40:22,400
Rym: there are people listening, like there's eight people watching the live stream right now, gaga, and there's actually a lot of chatter in this.

679
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:26,650
Rym: People are invested in the concept of we're going to retool Wednesday, I guess.

680
00:40:27,593 --> 00:40:39,560
Scott: So Thursday is also... I mean, someone who cares about GeekNights enough to watch a GeekNights live stream, the listener is going to have something to say about itself more than about anything.

681
00:40:40,241 --> 00:40:53,274
Rym: But I guess what I'll say is like from a making a podcast that makes a tiny amount of money and technically is thus a professional podcast and also having made a terrifyingly long running podcast that blurt like.

682
00:40:53,535 --> 00:40:58,600
Rym: it's a hobby and we do it primarily because we like it, but it's done it for a long fucking time.

683
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,762
Rym: We put a lot of effort into this.

684
00:41:00,162 --> 00:41:03,047
Rym: Thursday is a vehicle just to get us talking.

685
00:41:03,247 --> 00:41:04,910
Rym: Like it doesn't really matter what the topic is.

686
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:09,858
Rym: It just has to be something where we both have more words to say than we can fit into the episode.

687
00:41:09,878 --> 00:41:11,220
Rym: And then it's just an easy show to do.

688
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:11,600
Rym: Right.

689
00:41:12,241 --> 00:41:16,347
Scott: And the book club, which is also on Thursday, is less about.

690
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:18,850
Scott: can we make a good podcast?

691
00:41:20,313 --> 00:41:25,480
Scott: What it's more about is A, I can get myself to read.

692
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:26,260
Scott: Right.

693
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:29,706
Scott: Whereas, you know, sometimes you can sort of forget about books.

694
00:41:29,766 --> 00:41:29,906
Scott: Right.

695
00:41:29,926 --> 00:41:38,320
Scott: Because it's like if someone comes and asks you what my hobbies are, it's like, oh, you know, biking and photography and baking and computers, obviously.

696
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:41,746
Scott: And games, tabletop games, board games, video games.

697
00:41:41,806 --> 00:41:41,986
Scott: Right.

698
00:41:42,287 --> 00:41:44,330
Scott: It's like books that don't even enter it.

699
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:44,670
Scott: Right.

700
00:41:44,991 --> 00:41:47,615
Scott: But it's like, no, actually, I fucking love books.

701
00:41:47,695 --> 00:41:50,460
Scott: Any time I read a book, I usually say good one.

702
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:54,346
Rym: I'm also excited to talk about books with other people who have read those books.

703
00:41:54,506 --> 00:41:55,548
Rym: so we can just talk about.

704
00:41:55,668 --> 00:41:55,928
Scott: Exactly.

705
00:41:55,968 --> 00:41:56,489
Scott: So it's like.

706
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:57,330
Scott: Right.

707
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:59,954
Scott: So it's about, you know, remember to read.

708
00:42:00,335 --> 00:42:00,555
Scott: Right.

709
00:42:01,397 --> 00:42:02,298
Scott: Enjoy reading.

710
00:42:02,338 --> 00:42:03,600
Scott: Enjoy talking about reading.

711
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:06,303
Scott: And then get the listener to read.

712
00:42:06,383 --> 00:42:06,583
Scott: Right.

713
00:42:06,603 --> 00:42:12,470
Scott: Because I feel like, you know, that's often a thing where it's like if I meet a random, a completely random stranger.

714
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:13,051
Scott: Right.

715
00:42:13,671 --> 00:42:21,600
Scott: If you tell me just one fact about that person, like whether or not they read books of any kind for pleasure.

716
00:42:22,261 --> 00:42:22,581
Scott: Right.

717
00:42:23,382 --> 00:42:27,486
Scott: Obviously, it is prejudice for me to judge them based on that one piece of information.

718
00:42:27,506 --> 00:42:28,086
Rym: Judge them.

719
00:42:28,166 --> 00:42:29,928
Rym: You do judge them.

720
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:30,449
Scott: I do.

721
00:42:30,689 --> 00:42:34,773
Scott: And usually that judgment as very high accuracy.

722
00:42:35,133 --> 00:42:35,333
Scott: Right.

723
00:42:35,694 --> 00:42:37,536
Scott: People who read it's, you know, it just out.

724
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:42,000
Scott: people who read for pleasure are usually kind of people that I like.

725
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:43,161
Rym: I'll go further.

726
00:42:43,241 --> 00:42:43,782
Scott: Be around.

727
00:42:44,042 --> 00:42:44,863
Scott: Want to talk to.

728
00:42:45,264 --> 00:42:45,384
Scott: Right.

729
00:42:45,424 --> 00:42:55,115
Scott: And people who don't read books for pleasure are usually the kind of person that, you know, either is a unfortunate and illiterate, which is just sad or be right.

730
00:42:55,355 --> 00:42:57,598
Scott: A person I don't respect wouldn't want to hang.

731
00:42:57,638 --> 00:42:58,459
Scott: I'll go further.

732
00:42:58,479 --> 00:42:59,340
Scott: My kind of person.

733
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:06,347
Rym: I have known people in my life who did not read for pleasure, who started to read for pleasure at some point in their lives.

734
00:43:06,887 --> 00:43:10,691
Rym: And I will say that every one of those people, I can think of four.

735
00:43:12,072 --> 00:43:13,574
Rym: Five, four or five.

736
00:43:14,615 --> 00:43:17,237
Rym: They became better people in my eyes over time.

737
00:43:17,317 --> 00:43:19,239
Scott: That's why we want the listener to read books.

738
00:43:19,259 --> 00:43:19,940
Scott: That's the whole point.

739
00:43:20,541 --> 00:43:24,124
Rym: So Thursday, again, still it's participatory.

740
00:43:24,264 --> 00:43:25,145
Rym: It's interactive.

741
00:43:25,806 --> 00:43:27,027
Rym: So let's go back to Wednesdays.

742
00:43:27,447 --> 00:43:29,129
Scott: I can actually I can go further than that.

743
00:43:29,169 --> 00:43:34,054
Scott: And I can say during the times in my life when I am reading more books.

744
00:43:34,594 --> 00:43:34,855
Scott: Right.

745
00:43:35,375 --> 00:43:40,240
Scott: I feel like a different, better person than in the times of my life when there is a book draft.

746
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:41,901
Scott: I don't know.

747
00:43:42,021 --> 00:43:44,743
Scott: I don't know if that is a causal relationship.

748
00:43:45,083 --> 00:43:46,003
Scott: I'm either direction.

749
00:43:46,044 --> 00:43:47,464
Scott: It could be when I'm feeling good.

750
00:43:47,505 --> 00:43:48,025
Scott: I read books.

751
00:43:48,065 --> 00:43:49,686
Scott: Yeah, it's hard to say.

752
00:43:49,806 --> 00:43:50,667
Scott: But yeah.

753
00:43:50,727 --> 00:43:56,491
Scott: But I you know, there is I feel based purely on feeling and no evidence that there is a correlation there.

754
00:43:56,571 --> 00:44:01,334
Rym: I feel the same thing because in the first couple of years of COVID, because I wasn't traveling at all, I was kind of stuck inside.

755
00:44:02,094 --> 00:44:07,078
Rym: I was doing a lot of other things because I was home and I ended up not reading a lot.

756
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:10,220
Rym: And I just felt better when I picked up another book.

757
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:16,567
Rym: Then I started reading again, like about a year and a half into COVID, like suddenly my brain was just like, yeah, that's what you needed, buddy.

758
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:17,207
Rym: Right there.

759
00:44:17,347 --> 00:44:19,890
Scott: That words, words.

760
00:44:20,711 --> 00:44:29,200
Rym: So Wednesdays now, early GeekNights, we had it where there is one minor area where we have some expertise.

761
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:37,648
Rym: And that area was how to successfully run an anime club in the environment of the 2000s.

762
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:39,730
Scott: Like we had some expertise.

763
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:40,571
Scott: We did it.

764
00:44:40,591 --> 00:44:41,272
Rym: We did it well.

765
00:44:41,552 --> 00:44:42,433
Rym: We learned lessons.

766
00:44:42,693 --> 00:44:43,534
Rym: We could talk about it.

767
00:44:43,995 --> 00:44:49,560
Rym: And also we were heavy consumers of anime, animation, manga and comics.

768
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:56,128
Scott: Like in a time when most people had not seen or read most mangas and animes.

769
00:44:56,188 --> 00:44:56,328
Scott: Right.

770
00:44:56,368 --> 00:45:00,613
Scott: It's like, yes, by the time we started to GeekNights, the bookstores are full of manga.

771
00:45:01,033 --> 00:45:01,354
Scott: Yes.

772
00:45:01,414 --> 00:45:03,536
Scott: There was anime on TV by that time.

773
00:45:03,596 --> 00:45:03,877
Scott: Yes.

774
00:45:04,077 --> 00:45:06,280
Scott: Anime was just on DVDs by that time.

775
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:06,640
Scott: Right.

776
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:10,944
Scott: But it was just digital pirated fansubs by that time.

777
00:45:11,364 --> 00:45:13,466
Scott: But the majority of people.

778
00:45:13,666 --> 00:45:13,826
Scott: Right.

779
00:45:13,866 --> 00:45:20,813
Scott: It was only it was still even then, you know, only hitting the nerds who cared about this stuff, of which there were many.

780
00:45:21,293 --> 00:45:29,100
Scott: But people did not have, you know, the consumption level that we had at the time was way higher than other people.

781
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:35,306
Rym: We would literally have to like stop and be like, all right, of the five fucking shows we've watched in the last week, which one do we review?

782
00:45:36,147 --> 00:45:41,232
Scott: And not only that, but it was we had because we had started early in the 90s.

783
00:45:41,553 --> 00:45:41,793
Scott: Right.

784
00:45:42,113 --> 00:45:48,740
Scott: We had built up a large arsenal of of anime that we had seen.

785
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:59,049
Scott: And even people who were big time fans, if they had started becoming fans at the boom time, when the Tokyo pop hit the bookstores, when the ADV hit the conventions.

786
00:45:59,169 --> 00:45:59,489
Scott: Right.

787
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:04,734
Scott: If they had started, then we were way ahead of them in terms of things we had seen in red.

788
00:46:05,054 --> 00:46:05,294
Scott: Right.

789
00:46:05,394 --> 00:46:09,077
Scott: And so we could talk about anime, you know, all fucking day.

790
00:46:10,018 --> 00:46:12,300
Scott: There's even more about it than some other people.

791
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:14,923
Rym: I think what you just said, we knew more about it than some other people.

792
00:46:14,983 --> 00:46:15,424
Rym: That sort of.

793
00:46:15,444 --> 00:46:27,598
Rym: there was some low hanging fruit there that made Wednesday feel equal and gravitas to say Tuesday in that anime, manga, comics were equal in our lives to gaming.

794
00:46:27,958 --> 00:46:29,380
Rym: And we cared about them a lot.

795
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:42,929
Rym: But at the time, because knowledge of anime beyond just watching it was rare, like even among people who were so nerdy, they went to a nerdy university and joined the anime club and came every week to watch anime.

796
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:46,451
Rym: They didn't like they couldn't name more than like two anime directors.

797
00:46:46,491 --> 00:46:47,572
Rym: They didn't know anything.

798
00:46:47,912 --> 00:46:59,080
Rym: And because we knew a little bit more, if you look at early anime panels we did at anime cons, our panels were things like, hey, here's the names of 10 directors of anime you've heard of.

799
00:47:00,081 --> 00:47:01,803
Scott: We did that panel a lot.

800
00:47:02,604 --> 00:47:11,876
Rym: We'd be like, hey, did you know the history of like this genre, like really low hanging fruit, like low key read Wikipedia at people basically.

801
00:47:12,516 --> 00:47:15,200
Rym: And that was really low hanging fruit content.

802
00:47:15,701 --> 00:47:19,046
Rym: But look at now, look at the average GeekNights gaming panel.

803
00:47:19,547 --> 00:47:27,460
Rym: We don't make new ones that often because we really want to like research and like know what we're talking about enough to get out of stage and like not be wrong about things.

804
00:47:27,801 --> 00:47:31,146
Rym: And our expertise has grown, but we're not making anime.

805
00:47:31,367 --> 00:47:32,509
Rym: We're not making animation.

806
00:47:32,529 --> 00:47:33,230
Scott: We're not making.

807
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:39,300
Rym: I can't even draw and can't draw right at all, but also busy and we don't live together anymore.

808
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:45,428
Rym: So one, neither one of us watch nearly as much stuff as we used to not even just anime, but like anything.

809
00:47:46,309 --> 00:47:48,252
Rym: We do less passive entertainment in general.

810
00:47:48,733 --> 00:47:51,977
Rym: I watch a lot more than Scott, but I watch a lot less than most people we know.

811
00:47:52,418 --> 00:47:53,619
Rym: And Scott watches like nothing.

812
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:55,382
Scott: At least not.

813
00:47:55,422 --> 00:47:57,868
Scott: I don't watch television, at least, but also I watch.

814
00:47:57,948 --> 00:48:01,016
Scott: I've seen all the movies, though I've seen how many movies I'm seeing right.

815
00:48:01,076 --> 00:48:02,760
Scott: Like this is big time movie season.

816
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:03,321
Scott: Oh, my God.

817
00:48:03,341 --> 00:48:09,060
Scott: We just did the show where we probably see more movies in the past like month or two than I've seen like in the past several years.

818
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,626
Rym: There's five and I might and I might go right.

819
00:48:11,706 --> 00:48:13,571
Scott: I might go see two more movies.

820
00:48:13,591 --> 00:48:15,676
Scott: I could even just go see one after this show.

821
00:48:15,736 --> 00:48:16,217
Scott: I can go see that.

822
00:48:16,237 --> 00:48:17,280
Scott: I got to see the Mario movie.

823
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:19,003
Scott: Got to see that you could do a Wednesday show.

824
00:48:19,043 --> 00:48:20,505
Rym: I'm going to go see the movie.

825
00:48:21,427 --> 00:48:23,650
Rym: I'm not going to go see that.

826
00:48:23,951 --> 00:48:29,580
Scott: I might want to see even though I think it's going to be, you know, not necessarily the greatest movie ever or anything like that.

827
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,347
Scott: But I just want to go see the one with the Finnish guy killing.

828
00:48:32,387 --> 00:48:33,009
Scott: Oh, yes.

829
00:48:33,089 --> 00:48:33,630
Rym: I think you mean.

830
00:48:33,931 --> 00:48:34,352
Rym: Why not?

831
00:48:34,372 --> 00:48:35,595
Scott: You mean I could spend.

832
00:48:35,675 --> 00:48:37,380
Scott: I could spend two hours on that whatever.

833
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:40,361
Rym: But.

834
00:48:40,381 --> 00:48:46,790
Rym: We also we watch a lot less and we're often watching different things just because our lives are different.

835
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:54,560
Rym: So like Scott Sousa may I'm going to see it like in a week, but like I watched all the houses out except the final movie.

836
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:55,402
Rym: I don't think you've watched.

837
00:48:55,422 --> 00:48:56,645
Rym: I've watched Zero Owl House.

838
00:48:56,665 --> 00:48:57,046
Rym: Exactly.

839
00:48:57,086 --> 00:48:57,788
Rym: It's done.

840
00:48:57,828 --> 00:49:02,860
Scott: I've seen clips of Owl House on YouTube and I've seen many JPEGs and GIFs of Owl House.

841
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:03,986
Rym: What I will say is it's done.

842
00:49:04,046 --> 00:49:06,560
Scott: I know an Owl House when I see it, but I've never seen it.

843
00:49:07,121 --> 00:49:13,209
Rym: And so all this is sort of coming toward the fact that Wednesdays are unique in that they're.

844
00:49:13,289 --> 00:49:15,432
Rym: they're not genre bound, but they're.

845
00:49:15,692 --> 00:49:21,460
Rym: they're bound to the passive consumption of a narrow spectrum of media.

846
00:49:23,101 --> 00:49:29,271
Rym: And all the other days of GeekNights have a lot of other avenues for shows or professionalism or expertise.

847
00:49:29,631 --> 00:49:35,100
Rym: But Wednesdays are just like, hey, we're going to talk about a show we watched or a comic we read.

848
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:37,183
Scott: Well, it's not just that.

849
00:49:37,263 --> 00:49:44,600
Scott: It's also that, you know, we already said, you know, our knowledge of this area is admittedly and has become apparent over time.

850
00:49:45,341 --> 00:49:46,945
Scott: Not any more than anyone else's.

851
00:49:47,065 --> 00:49:47,205
Scott: Right.

852
00:49:47,265 --> 00:49:52,900
Scott: It's like if you're also an anime watcher, it's like we, you know, in the year 2023, at least we don't know anything you don't know.

853
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:58,300
Rym: You might come to us to like find out what we think of a show, but you're not going to come to us to find out a show exists.

854
00:49:58,841 --> 00:50:02,849
Scott: In fact, it's probably one of the only I think more so than any other day.

855
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:07,038
Scott: It's where the listener comes and tells and has more knowledge than we do.

856
00:50:07,218 --> 00:50:07,940
Scott: And they do.

857
00:50:09,421 --> 00:50:10,423
Scott: There's no denying it.

858
00:50:10,463 --> 00:50:10,683
Scott: Right.

859
00:50:11,064 --> 00:50:11,485
Scott: And it's like.

860
00:50:11,545 --> 00:50:14,210
Scott: but I thought, you know, at least I didn't actually think too hard about it.

861
00:50:14,270 --> 00:50:16,876
Scott: But it's just like, you know, it didn't.

862
00:50:17,256 --> 00:50:18,980
Scott: it was like, yes, I don't know.

863
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:24,070
Scott: You know, I was basically never lying to myself, act in thinking that I knew more than people.

864
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:25,092
Scott: once I realized.

865
00:50:25,172 --> 00:50:28,980
Rym: I think it's the bar got raised among anime fandom across the board.

866
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:30,200
Scott: Yeah.

867
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:32,005
Scott: Well, I mean, the bar was already high.

868
00:50:32,025 --> 00:50:33,889
Scott: There were already people who knew more.

869
00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:36,396
Scott: But now there's more people who know more.

870
00:50:36,456 --> 00:50:38,100
Scott: It's not just like there was experts.

871
00:50:39,162 --> 00:50:49,340
Scott: And then, you know, I guess we might have previously been in the superfan category, whereas now like anime fans know more than we do because we're just not animating that much.

872
00:50:49,862 --> 00:50:52,100
Scott: We're nerds who watch some anime sometimes.

873
00:50:52,620 --> 00:51:02,580
Rym: Yeah, but we backed off, whereas other people we knew and we see double down on anime and animation the same way we double down on gaming to a degree.

874
00:51:03,501 --> 00:51:03,722
Scott: Yep.

875
00:51:03,943 --> 00:51:04,526
Scott: It's like I have.

876
00:51:04,586 --> 00:51:07,380
Scott: I have halved or maybe even more than halved, you know.

877
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:10,846
Rym: But also, you know, there was a long, slow decline.

878
00:51:10,886 --> 00:51:15,516
Rym: We got bolstered a little bit because My Little Pony fit into Wednesday because it was anime animation.

879
00:51:15,557 --> 00:51:17,060
Rym: And we were into that for a hot minute.

880
00:51:18,322 --> 00:51:23,155
Rym: But we also stopped going to anime conventions for a couple of for a bunch of reasons.

881
00:51:23,195 --> 00:51:23,977
Rym: We're not going to believe it.

882
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:25,020
Rym: We talked about that to death.

883
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:34,740
Rym: But if, say, we were invited to go to, I don't know, Anime Boston, still a great anime convention, and we were invited to PAX at the same time.

884
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:40,160
Rym: If someone if someone said if PAX came to us and said, hey, we need a new panel that literally happened.

885
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:50,260
Rym: Yeah, but if PAX came to me right to us right now and said we need a new panel on gaming that's legit and we need it in two weeks for a brand new PAX, we could crank that out.

886
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,102
Rym: We could do something.

887
00:51:51,484 --> 00:51:57,040
Rym: If Anime Boston has to do that for anime, I got fucking nothing that I would be comfortable.

888
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:59,420
Scott: We could do something, but it just wouldn't be that good.

889
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:00,363
Rym: It would be Woo Game.

890
00:52:00,704 --> 00:52:01,767
Rym: It would be low tier.

891
00:52:01,787 --> 00:52:02,530
Rym: It would be low.

892
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:05,720
Rym: It wouldn't be any different from the anime content we did a decade ago.

893
00:52:06,621 --> 00:52:07,264
Scott: It would be weak.

894
00:52:07,565 --> 00:52:07,846
Scott: Right.

895
00:52:07,926 --> 00:52:08,951
Rym: So it would be weak enough.

896
00:52:09,131 --> 00:52:09,934
Rym: I wouldn't want to do it.

897
00:52:09,975 --> 00:52:11,340
Rym: I would decline the invitation.

898
00:52:12,361 --> 00:52:12,621
Scott: Sure.

899
00:52:12,922 --> 00:52:15,047
Scott: So it's like, all right, so we're in this situation.

900
00:52:15,087 --> 00:52:17,473
Scott: We know, like, what do we have to offer?

901
00:52:18,075 --> 00:52:20,140
Scott: manga anime knowledge wise, right?

902
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:20,360
Scott: It's like.

903
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:31,120
Scott: the only thing we really have to offer is, like Rym said, our personal take on a thing that we happen to have both watched or read, which is not that many things.

904
00:52:31,882 --> 00:52:33,880
Scott: It's definitely not a new thing every other week.

905
00:52:34,261 --> 00:52:41,400
Scott: I think the only thing we got, there's no, we don't have knowledge that we can offer beyond reading the same Wikipedia anime news.

906
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:44,775
Rym: There's one bit of knowledge we've got, but we've shared it fully.

907
00:52:44,835 --> 00:52:45,960
Rym: And I think there's no more to share.

908
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:52,600
Rym: And that is we know a lot about American anime fandom from a very narrow time period.

909
00:52:53,041 --> 00:52:57,320
Scott: That's I think, yes, to younger people, we can offer knowledge of the older days.

910
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:03,240
Rym: Our last Anime Con panel, if we ever go back to them, we'll be sitting on one of those old guys panels talking about what it was like.

911
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,971
Scott: We could already sit on the old guy's panel.

912
00:53:06,031 --> 00:53:08,240
Rym: We could sit on the old guy's panel a while ago at this point.

913
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:09,061
Scott: Right.

914
00:53:09,081 --> 00:53:12,840
Scott: But that's not enough for a podcast every two weeks to just lean on that one thing.

915
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:20,680
Scott: And, you know, not being experts, not being creators, you know, what do we need?

916
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,729
Scott: Do we even, we just can't, we just go cut back?

917
00:53:23,849 --> 00:53:26,118
Scott: Like, GeekNights is now Monday, Tuesday, Thursday.

918
00:53:26,178 --> 00:53:26,780
Scott: Forget Wednesday.

919
00:53:27,403 --> 00:53:31,660
Scott: Or, you know, clearly we just, you know, we could do anything the fuck we want, right?

920
00:53:32,401 --> 00:53:38,980
Scott: We've never actually promised or we actually promised that we wouldn't commit fully to any format.

921
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:44,220
Scott: We just fell into a format and stuck with it through pure momentum and inertia.

922
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:51,320
Rym: Well, also because the format worked and we actually, like, we really- Well, it worked production-wise and I guess nobody complained about it listener-wise.

923
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:56,360
Rym: We also spent a lot of time developing it and we did try other bits in those early, early days.

924
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:58,839
Scott: We did try some other bits, like once each maybe.

925
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,740
Rym: Yeah, but we settled into this because it works.

926
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:04,119
Scott: We didn't really try as much as we could have tried other bits.

927
00:54:04,921 --> 00:54:12,020
Rym: But I still- Because I not that long ago listened to a bunch of our beta episodes because they're just on the Patreon if anyone wants to listen to them for free.

928
00:54:12,662 --> 00:54:14,194
Rym: And I did commentary on them.

929
00:54:14,214 --> 00:54:15,000
Rym: That's a whole old thing.

930
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:21,199
Rym: But I also found all the other sound effects and bumpers that we just haven't used in at least 15 years.

931
00:54:24,381 --> 00:54:28,900
Rym: So, if you came here expecting we're going to announce what GeekNights Wednesday turned into.

932
00:54:29,443 --> 00:54:29,806
Rym: No, no, no.

933
00:54:29,827 --> 00:54:30,898
Rym: We're still trying to figure that out.

934
00:54:32,891 --> 00:54:34,200
Rym: So, got a lot of ideas.

935
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:41,220
Rym: One thing I was thinking is we could turn Wednesday into the review day and that's the only day we review passive media of any kind.

936
00:54:42,103 --> 00:54:43,680
Rym: And Thursday is the open day.

937
00:54:44,041 --> 00:54:48,460
Rym: But that'll hurt us because right now we can lean on talking about a movie we watched on Thursday.

938
00:54:49,003 --> 00:54:51,660
Rym: If we move that to Wednesday, Thursday gets hard again.

939
00:54:52,142 --> 00:54:54,220
Scott: We haven't done too many Thursday movie episodes.

940
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:56,599
Rym: Not in a while, but that might work.

941
00:54:58,184 --> 00:54:59,599
Rym: There's a lot of ways we could take Wednesday.

942
00:55:00,282 --> 00:55:01,971
Scott: I mean, we could also just forget it.

943
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:10,340
Scott: Not talking about changing the format of the episode itself, but it's like the schedule.

944
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:13,600
Scott: We could just only do a Wednesday when we see something.

945
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:16,799
Scott: And otherwise, we just don't do Wednesdays that often.

946
00:55:17,081 --> 00:55:19,519
Rym: And I'm not opposed to that either.

947
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:22,329
Scott: There's so many options.

948
00:55:22,792 --> 00:55:24,060
Scott: We could basically do whatever we want.

949
00:55:24,642 --> 00:55:25,468
Scott: We could change everything.

950
00:55:25,528 --> 00:55:27,400
Scott: We could change Monday, Tuesday, Thursday also.

951
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:29,207
Scott: We could just be like, "You know what?

952
00:55:29,287 --> 00:55:31,477
Scott: GeekNights is now a quarterly

953
00:55:31,557 --> 00:55:31,859
Scott: show.".

954
00:55:32,322 --> 00:55:33,419
Scott: Who says?

955
00:55:34,283 --> 00:55:36,420
Rym: We could make a Friday special that comes out once a month.

956
00:55:37,821 --> 00:55:40,189
Scott: But the point is that Wednesday is the thing.

957
00:55:40,610 --> 00:55:43,400
Scott: that is a problem that needs fixing.

958
00:55:44,142 --> 00:55:50,020
Scott: Even if there's improvements to be made, the other three days aren't perfect.

959
00:55:50,561 --> 00:55:54,277
Scott: But they are not in such a dire strait as Wednesday is.

960
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:59,114
Rym: And I think what drove me to suggest we do this episode wasn't just.

961
00:55:59,134 --> 00:56:00,759
Rym: we didn't have a good Wednesday show to do.

962
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:02,328
Rym: Though that was a big part of it.

963
00:56:02,369 --> 00:56:03,397
Rym: I'm not going to pretend it wasn't.

964
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:13,100
Rym: But another part of it was when we realized that there was something fundamentally different about the topic itself on Wednesday compared to the other days.

965
00:56:13,501 --> 00:56:18,620
Rym: Wednesday just doesn't fit into our lives the way we originally envisioned it anymore.

966
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:23,000
Scott: Well, I mean, because Monday and Tuesday, like you said, are not passive, right?

967
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:28,900
Scott: Gaming is, at least even if there is passive games out there, you're playing, right?

968
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:33,040
Scott: There's still instructions, at least, somehow.

969
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:36,580
Scott: You know, GeekNights, some of our earliest episodes are How to Not Suck, right?

970
00:56:36,961 --> 00:56:42,460
Scott: We are perhaps egotistically telling people what to do and how to live their lives.

971
00:56:43,561 --> 00:56:48,720
Scott: Giving advice, unwarranted, mansplaining to people how they should go about their business.

972
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,520
Scott: Anyone listening to us can leave this room any time.

973
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:56,380
Scott: And it's like on Monday we can tell you how you should be using your computer, right?

974
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:59,920
Scott: How you should be securing it, giving you tech tips and techniques.

975
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:05,240
Scott: Tuesday we can tell you how to win at games, better ways to design games, other techniques.

976
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:07,271
Scott: On Thursday, I guess anything.

977
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:16,220
Scott: But on Wednesday, the only thing we can tell you on Wednesday is which media to choose to consume.

978
00:57:17,304 --> 00:57:19,956
Scott: There's no other instructions besides that.

979
00:57:21,865 --> 00:57:24,740
Scott: And the answer is almost always yes, so why do you even listen to the episode?

980
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:27,560
Scott: Just see what we've listed in the title and you know it's gonna be yes.

981
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:37,553
Rym: If you listen to our reviews of anime movies, you're gonna find that in every single episode we've ever done about an anime movie, we tell you watch every fucking anime movie.

982
00:57:37,593 --> 00:57:38,276
Rym: that's in a theater.

983
00:57:38,317 --> 00:57:39,080
Rym: that isn't a sequel.

984
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:41,799
Rym: Just like always, just watch them all.

985
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,360
Scott: Yeah, but there's not that many of them, even if they're not the best.

986
00:57:47,345 --> 00:57:48,300
Scott: You're not wasting your time.

987
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:53,620
Rym: But also we've constrained it down to where we can't even just review passive media.

988
00:57:53,921 --> 00:57:58,640
Rym: We can only review passive media that is an animation or a comic of some kind.

989
00:58:00,850 --> 00:58:01,259
Rym: So we'll see.

990
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:03,116
Rym: The other thing we're workshopping is...

991
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:10,079
Scott: I think the other problem is that even if you said, "Okay, Wednesday is all passively consumed

992
00:58:10,179 --> 00:58:10,480
Scott: media."

993
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:13,400
Scott: Still not gonna work because we don't consume the same media.

994
00:58:14,523 --> 00:58:18,980
Scott: Right, it's like I don't watch basically almost any television whatsoever, right?

995
00:58:21,281 --> 00:58:25,240
Rym: We already do movie reviews, like we got a place for that when we have a movie we're talking about.

996
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:32,680
Rym: But also we started, we didn't do this intentionally, but we realized we were doing it like over a decade ago.

997
00:58:33,461 --> 00:58:38,700
Rym: We used to review things even if they were really bad or we didn't like them in the early days.

998
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:41,739
Scott: We used to spend time in our lives watching and reading bad things.

999
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:42,960
Rym: Yep, partly so we could talk about them.

1000
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:50,940
Rym: But honestly we kind of moved to a model where I only review things that I either want you to watch or I have a really good reason to warn you about.

1001
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:56,339
Rym: Like if something's just meh, I feel like it's not even worth talking about, I don't want to waste your time or my time.

1002
00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:01,420
Rym: Nor do I want to give a negative review to something I don't care that much about because the creators might see that.

1003
00:59:01,721 --> 00:59:03,347
Rym: That could cause some bad feelings.

1004
00:59:04,089 --> 00:59:06,900
Rym: Why add that negativity to the world unless I have a good reason to bring it up?

1005
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:13,420
Rym: So as a result, even movies, we only talk about a movie on GeekNights if we both are really feeling that movie.

1006
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:24,320
Scott: Yeah, well that's I think above all else, that's the biggest thing is that even if it's a gaming topic or whatever, it's like I might not care.

1007
00:59:24,721 --> 00:59:35,980
Scott: But usually there's some caring, there is some thought I have in my brain and I have some urge to put that thought into the world in some form.

1008
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:38,643
Scott: Like I have something and I want to tell it to someone.

1009
00:59:38,864 --> 00:59:39,925
Scott: It's that same feeling.

1010
00:59:40,085 --> 00:59:51,040
Scott: I'm not saying it's a good feeling because it's that same feeling of that guy at the con who's been playing some game and he just really wants to tell someone about his D&D character.

1011
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:51,541
Scott: Right?

1012
00:59:52,403 --> 00:59:59,500
Scott: That feeling like you've got some idea, something happened to you, some story you want to tell and you just need an ear to hear it, right?

1013
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:10,040
Scott: And so, you know, podcast is a way where when I have some of those ideas I can, you know, save them up and then I can save them and get that out of my system, right?

1014
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:21,540
Scott: But I think, at least I believe, perhaps wrongly, that when I do that, it's like if I talk about a thing that I have at least some feeling, perhaps a strong feeling about, right?

1015
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:28,796
Scott: That that is a good entertaining content because there's some enthusiasm and excitement and something behind it, right?

1016
01:00:31,541 --> 01:00:32,021
Scott: Right.

1017
01:00:32,723 --> 01:00:42,680
Scott: It's like if I watch an anime, if I don't, even if it was good and I enjoyed myself, I might not have a particularly strong feeling about it.

1018
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:52,200
Scott: I don't always, like I just watched, we talked about this show a long time ago, we didn't finish watching it, but like I guess a month or two ago I finished watching Tatami Galaxy the whole time.

1019
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:52,701
Scott: Right?

1020
01:00:52,721 --> 01:00:58,574
Scott: And it's like, I saw it, I could, if someone wanted to discuss it with me, I could, right?

1021
01:00:58,774 --> 01:01:01,180
Scott: I enjoyed it, I would encourage other people to watch it.

1022
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:16,600
Scott: But like when I was done, I had no urge whatsoever to like, I didn't like get a bunch of ideas about the show that I felt like I had to say to like, you know, so even if we did like a final thoughts on it, it's like there would be no excitement there.

1023
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:20,307
Scott: I would have no built up idea, right?

1024
01:01:20,427 --> 01:01:20,748
Scott: Of like.

1025
01:01:20,888 --> 01:01:22,812
Scott: a thing I really want to say about that show.

1026
01:01:22,892 --> 01:01:24,455
Scott: It got me, got me going.

1027
01:01:24,876 --> 01:01:27,120
Scott: And so I don't think the show would be that good.

1028
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:34,873
Rym: And there's a lot of early anime episodes where we review an anime that's just like a C-tier anime and we have fucking nothing to say.

1029
01:01:35,274 --> 01:01:38,860
Rym: We kind of just summarize the plot and we're like, yeah, probably not worth watching.

1030
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:39,642
Rym: And that's the show.

1031
01:01:39,763 --> 01:01:42,050
Rym: Like we just, we wasted your time.

1032
01:01:42,090 --> 01:01:45,060
Rym: You could have just watched that, watched an episode and come to the same conclusion.

1033
01:01:45,841 --> 01:01:46,041
Scott: Right.

1034
01:01:46,081 --> 01:01:53,840
Scott: Whereas like you look at the opposite, like say a lot of the panels that we do at PAX and a lot of those, it's like, I've got something grinding my gears.

1035
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:55,100
Scott: I've got something stuck in my craw.

1036
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:58,145
Scott: I got something stuck in my craw, right?

1037
01:01:58,265 --> 01:01:59,408
Scott: That is, I really want it.

1038
01:01:59,468 --> 01:02:04,860
Scott: I got this idea or I got something and I really want to say it so I can, I can easily just boom.

1039
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:07,914
Scott: I make this whole panel about it and go on a huge, right?

1040
01:02:07,994 --> 01:02:09,120
Scott: Just because I, you know.

1041
01:02:10,001 --> 01:02:18,120
Rym: We're thinking of new panels, like one of those are proposing an idea occasionally, and usually we know we got a hit when suddenly we just start talking about the idea like a lot.

1042
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:20,730
Rym: Then we know, all right, this is stuck in our craws.

1043
01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:21,835
Rym: We're going to do something with this.

1044
01:02:22,177 --> 01:02:22,860
Rym: This is a topic.

1045
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:23,480
Scott: Right.

1046
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:24,462
Scott: So I don't have anything.

1047
01:02:24,542 --> 01:02:29,889
Scott: I got like my anime, manga, comics, craw is basically emptied, right?

1048
01:02:29,969 --> 01:02:48,680
Scott: All the things that I had to complain about, like either were said a long time ago are no longer relevant or just, you know, and I think, you know, another thing, looking at comics and forget about the anime and the manga, you know, when we started in the, in the, I guess when I was young, right, I go to the comic book store and had no money.

1049
01:02:50,421 --> 01:02:53,513
Scott: So I was only reading like X-Men and Spider-Man 2099.

1050
01:02:53,513 --> 01:02:55,219
Scott: That's the money I had at the end.

1051
01:02:56,021 --> 01:03:01,660
Scott: And then when I got to RIT, right, I guess, well, the comic book stores went away after middle school.

1052
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:06,560
Scott: So high school, I couldn't get any comics even though I had some money and I spent it on computers anyway.

1053
01:03:06,781 --> 01:03:07,302
Scott: So it's fine.

1054
01:03:08,025 --> 01:03:12,740
Scott: In college, I had some money and I was able to buy some comics again at a comic book store.

1055
01:03:13,621 --> 01:03:22,660
Scott: And then when I got out of college and had a job and at a comic book store in the city, that's when I started to combine and there were podcasts, you know, about comics.

1056
01:03:23,202 --> 01:03:25,380
Scott: So then I could learn about comics that I couldn't learn before.

1057
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:26,860
Rym: The cup overflowed at that point.

1058
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:28,121
Scott: Right.

1059
01:03:28,141 --> 01:03:30,500
Scott: So then I was just overloading on comics.

1060
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:34,720
Scott: I was just, I got, you know, built up huge shelves, read all the big comics, right.

1061
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:38,460
Scott: You know, trade paperbacks, going back decades, right.

1062
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:40,160
Scott: I just loaded up on all the comics.

1063
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:53,720
Scott: And then what's happened, it took a long time, but I'd say over the past five-ish years, right, it's like a lot of the comics that I was reading regularly ended or went away or whatever.

1064
01:03:54,641 --> 01:03:59,800
Scott: New ones did not really come and take their place in my regular reading schedule.

1065
01:04:00,981 --> 01:04:05,160
Scott: Some of them I got tired of, like, you know, even the great One Punch Man.

1066
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:07,118
Scott: It's like I got kind of tired of it.

1067
01:04:08,421 --> 01:04:13,580
Scott: Things like Chainsaw Man had a part one that ended, you know, Saga went on hiatus and came back.

1068
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:14,277
Scott: I still read that.

1069
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:15,818
Scott: There's no getting away from that one.

1070
01:04:17,122 --> 01:04:25,400
Scott: But it's like, but it's like I was putting in reliably for since I think 2006 an order form of comics to buy every month.

1071
01:04:26,046 --> 01:04:26,269
Scott: Right.

1072
01:04:26,431 --> 01:04:27,020
Scott: No matter what.

1073
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:31,079
Scott: I ordered at least like some comics, sometimes a huge pile of them.

1074
01:04:31,601 --> 01:04:31,821
Scott: Right.

1075
01:04:32,002 --> 01:04:40,640
Scott: From 2006 up until like, I think last year was the first year where there were months that I ordered nothing.

1076
01:04:41,244 --> 01:04:43,019
Scott: Like that went through the whole comic order form.

1077
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:45,739
Scott: And I was like, I'm like, there's nothing on here.

1078
01:04:46,221 --> 01:04:46,522
Scott: Right.

1079
01:04:46,602 --> 01:04:52,760
Scott: It's like there probably were several comics that were like terrific, fantastic or whatever they might enjoy.

1080
01:04:53,342 --> 01:04:54,999
Scott: But I'm not going to buy.

1081
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:56,124
Scott: You know, I'm like, I'm only.

1082
01:04:56,285 --> 01:04:59,580
Scott: you know, I was looking at how much money I'm spending on the comics versus how much I'm reading.

1083
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:05,300
Scott: And I'm like, look, I'm only going to buy the ones that I'm going to open the box and read immediately.

1084
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:07,339
Rym: Same strategy with Steam.

1085
01:05:08,441 --> 01:05:08,860
Scott: Exactly.

1086
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:13,580
Scott: It's like if I order a new saga volume and it comes, I hope I'm reading it that night.

1087
01:05:13,762 --> 01:05:14,105
Scott: Right.

1088
01:05:14,166 --> 01:05:15,440
Scott: Or the next day at the latest.

1089
01:05:15,662 --> 01:05:15,844
Scott: Right.

1090
01:05:15,905 --> 01:05:17,460
Scott: It's happening immediately.

1091
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:22,160
Scott: But there's a lot of comics that I've bought over time that I buy.

1092
01:05:22,981 --> 01:05:24,859
Scott: When I ordered them, I was feeling good about them.

1093
01:05:25,203 --> 01:05:26,539
Scott: And they're still sitting here unread.

1094
01:05:28,302 --> 01:05:29,479
Scott: And it's like, why did I order that?

1095
01:05:30,041 --> 01:05:33,620
Scott: So now the line for what I'm going to order has raised significantly.

1096
01:05:34,323 --> 01:05:36,940
Scott: And I'm just not reading that many comics.

1097
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:46,340
Scott: Although I might I still might say that I enjoy comedy, you know, the the the graphic, you know, fiction art form above, like all other forms.

1098
01:05:48,384 --> 01:05:49,109
Scott: Probably I just had.

1099
01:05:49,129 --> 01:05:50,760
Scott: you know, I already have so much.

1100
01:05:50,881 --> 01:05:52,219
Scott: I'm not even reading all of it.

1101
01:05:52,802 --> 01:05:56,380
Scott: And it's like I've had my fill and I've already gone through like all the old.

1102
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:59,336
Scott: There was so much old stuff I had to catch up on and I've caught up.

1103
01:06:00,461 --> 01:06:01,207
Scott: You know, there might.

1104
01:06:01,268 --> 01:06:02,600
Scott: I'm sure I haven't caught up on everything.

1105
01:06:02,863 --> 01:06:02,985
Scott: Right.

1106
01:06:03,005 --> 01:06:03,309
Scott: That's just.

1107
01:06:03,370 --> 01:06:04,140
Scott: that's not possible.

1108
01:06:04,261 --> 01:06:08,140
Scott: But it's like the major significant ultra popular comics.

1109
01:06:08,542 --> 01:06:10,539
Scott: I've either read them or I know enough about them.

1110
01:06:11,121 --> 01:06:14,520
Scott: So what I have to read now is much less.

1111
01:06:15,601 --> 01:06:17,479
Rym: So we'll see what happens with Wednesdays.

1112
01:06:18,944 --> 01:06:20,060
Rym: We don't have a strong plan yet.

1113
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:21,339
Rym: We're thinking about this.

1114
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:24,540
Rym: We're thinking about some other things in the show, like maybe adding a new bit to the end.

1115
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:25,900
Rym: But we'll save that for a different.

1116
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:29,140
Scott: You know, we can mix up, you know, and anything is on the table.

1117
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:32,599
Scott: The format of the show, the schedule of the show.

1118
01:06:33,222 --> 01:06:33,363
Scott: Right.

1119
01:06:33,403 --> 01:06:36,019
Scott: I guess the only thing is I guess we'll agree we'll keep doing it.

1120
01:06:36,383 --> 01:06:37,293
Scott: We could cancel the show.

1121
01:06:37,313 --> 01:06:37,394
Scott: Yeah.

1122
01:06:38,042 --> 01:06:39,137
Scott: Just say no more GeekNights.

1123
01:06:39,239 --> 01:06:39,279
Scott: No.

1124
01:06:39,681 --> 01:06:43,440
Rym: I still like consistently somehow in the year two thousand twenty three.

1125
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,800
Rym: I still look forward to doing GeekNights most nights.

1126
01:06:46,301 --> 01:06:47,091
Rym: Not 100 percent of night.

1127
01:06:47,131 --> 01:06:47,880
Rym: Sometimes I'm tired.

1128
01:06:48,060 --> 01:06:54,180
Rym: You know, nobody nobody does likes doing the thing they do 100 percent of the time, especially if there's a schedule.

1129
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:58,120
Rym: But I generally like doing this show and I would like to keep doing it.

1130
01:06:58,362 --> 01:07:00,540
Rym: And Wednesday is really the only thing I definitely know.

1131
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:01,863
Scott: I don't think I've ever had.

1132
01:07:02,204 --> 01:07:05,532
Scott: You know, there have definitely I think I'd say the majority of the time.

1133
01:07:05,632 --> 01:07:08,800
Scott: I can't say that like I'm like, oh, yeah, let's do a GeekNights.

1134
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:09,662
Scott: Although that happens.

1135
01:07:09,943 --> 01:07:10,243
Scott: Right.

1136
01:07:10,504 --> 01:07:15,717
Scott: But I don't think I've ever even one time, not once in 15, 16, whatever years.

1137
01:07:17,381 --> 01:07:22,040
Scott: I think I have zero memory of ever saying, oh, I don't want to do a GeekNights.

1138
01:07:22,140 --> 01:07:23,047
Scott: I don't think that's happened ever.

1139
01:07:23,370 --> 01:07:23,571
Scott: Never.

1140
01:07:23,632 --> 01:07:24,700
Scott: Not not even one time.

1141
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:24,921
Scott: Yeah.

1142
01:07:24,961 --> 01:07:30,320
Rym: Because if we're like good reasons, like one of us is sick, then it's not, oh, I don't want to do GeekNights.

1143
01:07:30,401 --> 01:07:32,759
Rym: It's I can't do GeekNights for canceling the show.

1144
01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:33,100
Scott: Yeah.

1145
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:38,260
Scott: There have been times where it's like there's a thing I'd rather do than GeekNights, like a hockey game or go bike or something.

1146
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,147
Rym: It's nice to see a concert like that.

1147
01:07:40,247 --> 01:07:43,180
Rym: Definitely skip, skip making your podcast to go to a concert.

1148
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:43,721
Rym: Yeah.

1149
01:07:43,741 --> 01:07:48,760
Scott: But I never once when going to sit to record GeekNights, been like, oh, I don't want to do this.

1150
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:49,141
Scott: Right.

1151
01:07:49,161 --> 01:07:49,402
Scott: Never.

1152
01:07:49,824 --> 01:07:50,346
Scott: So why?

1153
01:07:50,527 --> 01:07:53,680
Scott: So that, you know, if I had that feeling, then I think we should cancel the show.

1154
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:54,042
Scott: Yeah.

1155
01:07:54,242 --> 01:07:57,639
Rym: Or that's when we would like radically reimagine the show.

1156
01:07:58,480 --> 01:07:58,965
Scott: Sure.

1157
01:07:58,985 --> 01:08:00,340
Scott: Or do something else entirely.

1158
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:00,721
Scott: Yeah.

1159
01:08:00,741 --> 01:08:01,609
Rym: Something completely different.

1160
01:08:01,832 --> 01:08:02,660
Rym: Just turn it into a let's play.

1161
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:03,522
Scott: Wednesday.

1162
01:08:03,542 --> 01:08:03,662
Scott: Yeah.

1163
01:08:03,743 --> 01:08:04,707
Scott: Wednesday needs help.

1164
01:08:05,410 --> 01:08:07,440
Scott: You know, there's the obvious ideas, right?

1165
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:12,080
Scott: Because, you know, there's been so many formats of audio shows throughout history, right?

1166
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:19,500
Scott: You got your interviews, you got your roundtables, you got your storytelling, your dramas, right?

1167
01:08:19,701 --> 01:08:22,560
Scott: You got, you know, speeches, I guess, oration.

1168
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:25,993
Scott: You know, there's only so many formats of spoken content, right?

1169
01:08:26,013 --> 01:08:27,680
Scott: To choose from, you know, call in show.

1170
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:30,710
Scott: So we haven't, you know, got.

1171
01:08:30,729 --> 01:08:33,240
Scott: we haven't experimented with all the existing formats.

1172
01:08:33,441 --> 01:08:35,093
Scott: So clearly we can go to those.

1173
01:08:35,133 --> 01:08:36,019
Scott: They're all tried and true.

1174
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:37,363
Scott: Yeah.

1175
01:08:37,384 --> 01:08:42,080
Scott: Or we can try to be ultra creative and come up with something new or a mix or who knows.

1176
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:49,330
Rym: So this has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1177
01:08:49,491 --> 01:08:54,510
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1178
01:08:54,870 --> 01:08:59,890
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

1179
01:09:00,229 --> 01:09:02,810
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1180
01:09:03,069 --> 01:09:07,569
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1183
01:09:15,630 --> 01:09:18,529
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
