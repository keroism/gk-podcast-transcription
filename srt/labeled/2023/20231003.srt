1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,377
Rym: It's Tuesday, October 3rd, 2023.

2
00:00:11,377 --> 00:00:12,841
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,021 --> 00:00:15,989
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:16,009 --> 00:00:28,841
Rym: tonight We're reviewing counter-strike, which might as well be an episode from 2012 or 2002 or kind of strike to count to strike to.

5
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:31,358
Scott: Pretty sure we already did kind of strike a lot.

6
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:33,750
Rym: I gotta check to see if we did a counter-strike show.

7
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:36,222
Rym: I assume we did probably a long time ago.

8
00:00:36,242 --> 00:00:37,850
Rym: That's got to be an early game nights episode.

9
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,175
Scott: Let's do this.

10
00:00:40,557 --> 00:00:45,717
Rym: So, uh, you know things are getting a little back to normal when what I'm about to say is so.

11
00:00:46,299 --> 00:00:52,070
Rym: I was biking home from work like you do and This wasn't like a weird hobo attack or anything.

12
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:58,682
Rym: It was just I'm biking home and the previous day when I biked home There was just gridlock like all the cars in every direction.

13
00:00:58,722 --> 00:01:00,670
Rym: Manhattan just couldn't move and there's this big nonsense.

14
00:01:01,112 --> 00:01:06,093
Rym: But it was very apparent that that's just normal traffic now in New York Like there was nothing going on.

15
00:01:06,574 --> 00:01:08,238
Rym: That was just it and I biked past it all.

16
00:01:08,279 --> 00:01:11,587
Rym: it was cool today on my way home.

17
00:01:11,607 --> 00:01:28,521
Rym: I actually stopped for a second because something weird was going on like I'm biking home up on the east side the east side and Then suddenly it's like really quiet and I stopped and I realized there's no cars anywhere which is weird Like no cars are driving next to me in the road.

18
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:30,768
Rym: No cars are going across at the road.

19
00:01:30,808 --> 00:01:31,089
Scott: is this?

20
00:01:31,955 --> 00:01:33,264
Rym: This is the I'm coming up.

21
00:01:33,325 --> 00:01:34,070
Rym: what second Avenue?

22
00:01:35,992 --> 00:01:37,076
Scott: Does the second Avenue go south?

23
00:01:37,217 --> 00:01:37,980
Rym: then first Avenue?

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,190
Rym: I'm heading up on the east side the two one.

25
00:01:40,393 --> 00:01:41,729
Scott: Well, you it could be a UN thing.

26
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:42,894
Rym: yeah, so what?

27
00:01:42,914 --> 00:01:53,657
Rym: so I then notice that there's cops at every intersection blocking all four ways and multiple cross streets leading up the Queensborough Bridge are completely empty of cars and UN deal.

28
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:54,423
Rym: I don't know if it was.

29
00:01:54,463 --> 00:01:55,189
Rym: I don't know what it was.

30
00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:05,669
Rym: All I know is they were letting bikes through and it was the quietest most pleasant bike ride home I have had in a long long time.

31
00:02:06,711 --> 00:02:11,068
Scott: It could be you know, some important person driving through or you know, yeah, I don't know what it was.

32
00:02:11,452 --> 00:02:13,588
Scott: I was just yeah, that's not out of the ordinary.

33
00:02:13,628 --> 00:02:17,649
Rym: Yep What was interesting is there are cops everywhere at some of the big intersections like?

34
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:24,113
Rym: yelling all the people who are in cars like trying to get to the streets if they even had a path to the street and But they were.

35
00:02:24,173 --> 00:02:28,290
Rym: there's one cop who's just waving the bikes through like no you can go you can go just go just go.

36
00:02:28,654 --> 00:02:32,170
Scott: It's not gonna hurt the VIP in their armored vehicle.

37
00:02:32,491 --> 00:02:41,650
Rym: But there was also a giant dodgy looking FedEx truck that like looked wedged Up on the sidewalk under the Queensborough Bridge and there was much a cop standing around it.

38
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:45,010
Rym: Hmm, but that might just be normal, New York.

39
00:02:46,371 --> 00:02:48,579
Scott: None of that sounds really out of the ordinary.

40
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,786
Rym: No, it was just nice and quiet on my ride home.

41
00:02:51,148 --> 00:02:51,609
Rym: It was pleasant.

42
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:52,513
Rym: I wish they would.

43
00:02:52,593 --> 00:02:52,874
Scott: it is.

44
00:02:52,914 --> 00:02:54,038
Scott: it is nice when there's a.

45
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,785
Rym: I wish they would block all the cars.

46
00:02:55,845 --> 00:02:58,174
Scott: more often cars are removed For any reason.

47
00:02:58,435 --> 00:03:04,658
Scott: it's like that other day when I was running and then suddenly like I guess that also shows you is like You know the cop during rush hour.

48
00:03:04,698 --> 00:03:07,729
Scott: It's like the cops could remove the cars and the world didn't end.

49
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:13,130
Rym: Yeah, the world might have ended for the few thousand people sitting in those cars were angry.

50
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:13,632
Rym: But you know who?

51
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:18,370
Rym: it didn't end for the orders of magnitude more people transiting through the same space.

52
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:19,455
Rym: So we're not in a car.

53
00:03:19,997 --> 00:03:21,825
Scott: I mean and did the world really end for those people?

54
00:03:21,885 --> 00:03:22,649
Scott: They just got.

55
00:03:22,809 --> 00:03:24,000
Rym: I mean They're acting like it did.

56
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:28,190
Scott: Yeah Wait, you know however long and then you'll be home.

57
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,374
Rym: Yeah, mostly it's just.

58
00:03:31,454 --> 00:03:49,244
Rym: it's it's stark because during kovat the thing that was very notable was anytime I went outside New York City was quiet in a way that I have never experienced before Covid and will likely never experience again except in brief moments Like when cops block all the cars off the street until we finally banned cars

59
00:03:49,826 --> 00:03:51,009
Scott: if you just go somewhere else.

60
00:03:51,652 --> 00:04:00,420
Rym: But I live here and most of my biking is here getting between places here Anyway got some news so you may remember.

61
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:15,990
Rym: we talked about how unity shot itself in both feet announcing a ridiculous monetization scheme that nobody liked Likely as part of its long fall into hell after it merged with that ad scam company some years ago.

62
00:04:16,353 --> 00:04:22,727
Scott: Yeah, and they you know Did what most companies do when they fuck up which is try to say they're sorry and roll it back.

63
00:04:22,808 --> 00:04:33,404
Scott: and it's like well Okay, you rolled it back and the thing you rolled back to is a lot less bad than the thing you tried originally Yeah, but you've completely now lost all trust.

64
00:04:33,465 --> 00:04:43,630
Scott: I think there's a There's like an old saying that like, you know, I think it's like When trust comes in on foot and goes out on horseback.

65
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:47,279
Scott: It's like, you know, you can it.

66
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:53,470
Scott: to gain someone's trust takes a long time You know to prove that you're trustworthy and not you know.

67
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:56,905
Scott: It's like you don't want to rush in just trusting someone just out of nowhere.

68
00:04:56,945 --> 00:05:01,443
Scott: That's called being a fool Yeah, but you can lose someone's trust in an instant.

69
00:05:01,463 --> 00:05:02,227
Scott: you screw them over.

70
00:05:02,367 --> 00:05:17,017
Rym: once that's it They're gone, right and the indications I'm seeing from the people we know the games industry and the chatter In response to this in those channels seems to basically be Nothing, they've walked back changes anything.

71
00:05:17,097 --> 00:05:18,442
Rym: unity can't be trusted anymore.

72
00:05:18,783 --> 00:05:21,250
Rym: We are continuing our path to get off of unity.

73
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:22,053
Scott: I mean, I think I do.

74
00:05:22,234 --> 00:05:30,439
Scott: I read the new policy, you know, and it is, you know If you just take them at their word That is all they do that.

75
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:33,330
Scott: It's like hey, yeah, it's like it's alright.

76
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:40,074
Scott: It's like basically what they're gonna do is the really big games that really make a lot of money are gonna have to pay Different structure

77
00:05:40,575 --> 00:05:45,532
Rym: which everyone else model that the other big game engine unreal already has Basically, and

78
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:50,930
Scott: everyone else can basically use it for free depending on what version they got this details and whatever.

79
00:05:51,091 --> 00:06:11,845
Scott: but basically as long as you never make a bunch of money and is law and you know, If they if there's written text in there that says that you know, as long as you stick with this version Right, we won't force you into a new agreement except maybe and if they do change the agreement It'll only apply to like that future version when the agreement changes.

80
00:06:11,945 --> 00:06:13,310
Scott: so you can stick with this version.

81
00:06:13,892 --> 00:06:14,877
Scott: You know until whenever.

82
00:06:15,118 --> 00:06:17,549
Scott: but of course eventually that version will be useless.

83
00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:27,890
Rym: Yep so I feel like what's gonna happen is everyone who's got a game in process or was about to start may continue with unity because They've invested in using unit and a lot of people will not choose it for their next endeavor.

84
00:06:28,071 --> 00:06:30,082
Rym: I would probably not choose it for any endeavor.

85
00:06:30,162 --> 00:06:31,529
Rym: I was going to do because of all of this.

86
00:06:31,831 --> 00:06:32,795
Rym: I just can't trust him.

87
00:06:33,277 --> 00:06:36,429
Rym: but the unfortunate thing this other news here.

88
00:06:37,062 --> 00:06:40,558
Rym: so why did unity do that in the first place?

89
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:46,970
Rym: because there is an another problem in the industry that the Engines don't really actually make enough money.

90
00:06:47,712 --> 00:06:49,617
Scott: Anyway, yeah, it's really weird.

91
00:06:49,637 --> 00:06:54,010
Scott: You would think that like, okay people are out there making lots of games lots of them.

92
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:58,106
Scott: There's so many no one can play them most of them don't make money and fail right.

93
00:06:58,589 --> 00:07:05,450
Scott: and All the 3d ones most of the 3d ones across basically every platform are using one of these two engines.

94
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,012
Scott: It's all.

95
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:13,518
Scott: it's not a monopoly, but it's like it's you know, two only two competitors I've ever had about game engines.

96
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:17,287
Rym: was the pros and cons of epic versus unreal like it's never like.

97
00:07:17,348 --> 00:07:22,150
Scott: if you want to make a 3d Type of game like those are your choices.

98
00:07:22,771 --> 00:07:25,999
Scott: That'll get you on all the platforms for a modern game, right?

99
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:41,870
Scott: and the two companies that make those engines you think with so many games You know being built on your technology And if any of those games actually like tried to start from scratch It's like it would be impossible to replicate what those engines provide right?

100
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:47,542
Scott: It would take you such an enormous engineering effort They those all those companies that have to make little 2d games instead.

101
00:07:47,803 --> 00:07:51,737
Scott: or you could use one of these other Engines that are out there and there are many.

102
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:54,949
Scott: some of them are even free and open source engines that are out there.

103
00:07:55,513 --> 00:08:03,570
Scott: But they are so inferior right Technologically speaking that you basically cannot make a top tier game with them.

104
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:11,955
Scott: You can make a good game with them, but it's like people will be able to tell that your game is like Noticeably inferior right

105
00:08:12,275 --> 00:08:25,709
Rym: and the cost of not using an engine like I knew if you try to just make a game any serious Significant game from scratch and you think what do I need an engine for that's gonna cost more than anything,

106
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:25,870
Scott: right?

107
00:08:26,432 --> 00:08:27,917
Scott: So many it's not like.

108
00:08:27,957 --> 00:08:38,384
Scott: like if you want to make a website and you think like this web frameworks out there You know your rubies on rails and your Django's and your PHP Symphonies and your Java whatever the fucks they have Springs.

109
00:08:38,404 --> 00:08:39,147
Scott: I don't know fucking know.

110
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,956
Scott: this is 10,000 web, you know flask.

111
00:08:42,417 --> 00:08:51,708
Scott: so many engines out there right for every frickin programming language, but those are all free right, they're all open source and they all are basically feature complete.

112
00:08:51,788 --> 00:08:58,080
Scott: because Making a web engine is not such a great Engineering effort that you couldn't and you could make one.

113
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,688
Scott: you're on your own and basically it's really I could.

114
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:02,112
Scott: if I had to It wouldn't be.

115
00:09:02,173 --> 00:09:07,750
Scott: take me that log to basically, you know, at least for the features that I needed to basically make my own.

116
00:09:07,991 --> 00:09:08,593
Scott: It's doable.

117
00:09:08,854 --> 00:09:09,737
Scott: All right, it's an achiever.

118
00:09:09,777 --> 00:09:11,101
Scott: It's not like a Mount Everest, right?

119
00:09:11,182 --> 00:09:13,470
Scott: It's like a you know a mount in your town.

120
00:09:13,691 --> 00:09:15,488
Scott: Yeah, I hope no one lives in the Himalayas.

121
00:09:16,735 --> 00:09:27,771
Scott: so But like to make a 3d game engine that is Cross-platform and does all that graphics biz and all that you know.

122
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:35,252
Scott: like all the things that a top-tier game does these days the engineering effort to make that is preposterous.

123
00:09:35,312 --> 00:09:40,987
Scott: it might even be like, you know, like like a rocket launch and thus the problem.

124
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:55,170
Rym: unity and epic like unreal Effectively are subsidized for the rest of the industry for by various means because they themselves Need to make money by other mechanisms.

125
00:09:55,351 --> 00:10:05,290
Rym: So epic the competitor unity has also now laid off 16% of its workforce and is trying to achieve quote financial sustainability.

126
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:09,560
Scott: Yeah, they think that the people run fortnight are not profitable.

127
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:19,602
Rym: Yeah, the biggest probably the most popular game on earth But that's it's way up there though It's one of them made like it is the fortnight is way up there.

128
00:10:19,662 --> 00:10:26,742
Rym: talk about an example of a well-designed Successful fun game that terrifying numbers of people play.

129
00:10:27,143 --> 00:10:32,178
Rym: if that can't even make money How is this one even gonna make money?

130
00:10:32,218 --> 00:10:33,241
Rym: How is anyone gonna make?

131
00:10:33,321 --> 00:10:34,084
Scott: it is making.

132
00:10:34,144 --> 00:10:36,090
Scott: it is making it is too expensive.

133
00:10:36,231 --> 00:10:43,847
Scott: I read an article maybe I'll find it but basically they talk about how there's a. you know There's a missing middle in game development.

134
00:10:43,887 --> 00:10:49,190
Scott: right now We're basically you have your triple-a games your mega games with big budgets, right?

135
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:59,090
Scott: And then you have like, you know, you're there are they're successful But like your slay the spires or your vampire survivors that are like thrown together for almost no budget.

136
00:10:59,412 --> 00:11:02,350
Scott: Right, and there aren't games that have like, you know.

137
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:08,890
Scott: It's like you've either got a budget of like a bag of ramen or you have a budget of a lottery prize.

138
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:13,950
Rym: It is really hard to support the middle of an industry like this.

139
00:11:14,011 --> 00:11:21,589
Rym: That is the most expense To provide the things they need and the help they need for the least profit because only the two tail ends are gonna make money.

140
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,776
Scott: Nobody's making it any.

141
00:11:23,796 --> 00:11:25,101
Scott: it's basically not a lot.

142
00:11:25,181 --> 00:11:32,142
Scott: It's hardly any games with like a $50,000 budget $100,000 budget 200,000. those games.

143
00:11:32,403 --> 00:11:33,004
Scott: Where are they?

144
00:11:33,044 --> 00:11:34,245
Scott: They're not out there, right.

145
00:11:34,566 --> 00:11:38,594
Scott: or again and games that not only not only the budgets But the time frame right.

146
00:11:38,794 --> 00:11:43,890
Scott: you either threw it together at a game jam and a weekend or you spent three years on it.

147
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:48,086
Scott: Where is the six-month game that like, you know, you get together six months you get it out, right?

148
00:11:48,528 --> 00:11:49,010
Scott: Where is that?

149
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:49,652
Scott: It's not here.

150
00:11:49,953 --> 00:12:03,590
Rym: Well partly because the the entire industry sadly I think is built on a bubble of investor money and unrealistic expectations about free-to-play monetization models and or metaverse like nonsense.

151
00:12:04,593 --> 00:12:09,336
Scott: Well, I think it's all you know, it's if you're because the Everyone wants to be roblox.

152
00:12:09,858 --> 00:12:13,230
Scott: Well, we have this expectation right that you're gonna make this game.

153
00:12:13,731 --> 00:12:18,608
Scott: You know with like we have this amazing technology to make fancy games, right and it's like.

154
00:12:18,869 --> 00:12:25,410
Scott: well No matter what your game is making a game with that high-end technology Right is expensive.

155
00:12:25,691 --> 00:12:26,774
Scott: It's like already.

156
00:12:26,794 --> 00:12:31,187
Scott: you just budget right out of the gate to buy the developers computers is $3,000 per person.

157
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:40,763
Rym: The fact that a game like fortnight like a game that has servers or infrastructure or is online or evolves requires tons of constant investment.

158
00:12:40,824 --> 00:12:45,510
Rym: and yet While probably the right way to fund that is the people who play it pay money.

159
00:12:45,912 --> 00:12:48,766
Rym: We know that doesn't generate enough profits to fund a game like that.

160
00:12:48,827 --> 00:12:52,590
Rym: free-to-play Extracts money from so you wouldn't otherwise spend money.

161
00:12:52,771 --> 00:13:01,770
Scott: So you have a customer who wants a product that is highly engineered and expensive to produce All right, and yet is unwilling to pay what that actually costs.

162
00:13:02,051 --> 00:13:06,625
Rym: yep, and meanwhile look at the older days like look at an NES game in the 90s.

163
00:13:06,705 --> 00:13:27,966
Rym: Final Fantasy or Legend Zelda 2 and Mario 3 were both 65 and $70 at Toys R Us when I was a kid in 90s dollars and you paid money and you got a game Even in a single-player world in the modern era not many people are willing to pay Really any amount of dollars for a game.

164
00:13:29,751 --> 00:13:31,777
Scott: All right, well, yep, that's so.

165
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:36,870
Rym: I don't know where this goes because basically unity was under the same pressures.

166
00:13:37,051 --> 00:13:37,874
Scott: We've been waiting for.

167
00:13:37,895 --> 00:13:41,048
Scott: you've been waiting as long as GeekNights exists for various bubbles to burst.

168
00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:44,090
Scott: game development publishing bubbles ad bubbles.

169
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:49,710
Rym: They almost microburst like the people who are employed in these industries get screwed over and the industry contracts.

170
00:13:50,051 --> 00:13:58,610
Rym: But then like the bubble reforms as people find some increasingly esoteric way To trick people to pay for something that weren't otherwise gonna pay for it.

171
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,298
Rym: Because that's the thing that really bothers me in the end.

172
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:05,936
Rym: The entire monetization model even around fortnight is Basically instead of paying for a game.

173
00:14:06,077 --> 00:14:10,690
Rym: It is get people to pay for cosmetics who wouldn't otherwise pay for game.

174
00:14:11,074 --> 00:14:11,539
Rym: So you're trick.

175
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:20,362
Rym: you're getting someone to spend money They wouldn't have otherwise spent with some sort of free-to-play Inducive addictive model that I have a lot of concerns about.

176
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:25,439
Scott: I feel like what happened was, you know in the early 2000s Right when the tech bubble went, you know, right?

177
00:14:25,479 --> 00:14:26,282
Scott: It's like they blew.

178
00:14:26,423 --> 00:14:28,450
Scott: they blew into it too much and it popped, right?

179
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:31,123
Scott: Yeah, and they're like, okay We'll get another balloon and try again.

180
00:14:31,143 --> 00:14:34,139
Scott: and what they've been doing I guess as a whole is they learned.

181
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:36,870
Scott: the lesson they learned is don't blow too hard.

182
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:42,105
Scott: It'll pop right when it gets to when it gets too tight and the skin is too thin.

183
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:48,730
Scott: Let some air out Yeah, right It'll fart a bunch and then start blowing into it again.

184
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:53,413
Scott: And we're just blowing up and deflating this balloon over and over Yeah, and that.

185
00:14:53,473 --> 00:14:54,977
Scott: and to avoid popping it.

186
00:14:55,458 --> 00:15:01,078
Scott: and but every deflating part still sucks and it's like, you know It never holds it own.

187
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:01,663
Scott: It's never.

188
00:15:01,683 --> 00:15:04,846
Scott: you never tie it shut Doesn't fly it doesn't take off.

189
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:12,869
Rym: Yep I mean well We've got two balloons that hold up most of the modern video game industry and neither one has enough air.

190
00:15:14,033 --> 00:15:15,528
Rym: Anyway, you got any news?

191
00:15:16,152 --> 00:15:19,168
Scott: Well, I don't have a news, I mean there probably is easy to find news.

192
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:28,679
Scott: but whatever I played this game that I paid a few dollars for Called Heretics fork, right and heretic I was.

193
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:34,976
Scott: I was willing to pay for it because based on everything I saw it was a combination of Other games that I had seen right.

194
00:15:35,217 --> 00:15:36,582
Scott: there were slate aspire elements.

195
00:15:37,024 --> 00:15:38,810
Scott: There were inscription elements.

196
00:15:39,415 --> 00:15:40,989
Scott: There were tower defense elements.

197
00:15:41,572 --> 00:16:01,070
Scott: There were aesthetic elements from like demons tilt or Death crown sort of that, you know, that's sort of really scary kind of horror hell pixel II kind of aesthetic going on Elements of What's it called the one where it's a hypno space outlaw.

198
00:16:01,911 --> 00:16:07,250
Scott: Right, basically it was elements from a lot of games that were great games and it seemed like they were all combined in one game.

199
00:16:07,575 --> 00:16:10,063
Scott: So I checked it out And what it is?

200
00:16:10,771 --> 00:16:31,440
Scott: Heretics fork is basically It's more similar to like a solo tabletop card game like, you know Freedman's freeze Friday, and if you don't know about those basically, it's sort of like playing Dominion by yourself Right where you have a little deck and you play cards every turn Right and you're trying to optimize this deck.

201
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:39,650
Scott: and if you optimize it well enough to beat You know this AI or basically just to beat these numbers that are in the computer then you win.

202
00:16:40,172 --> 00:17:09,430
Scott: So what's happening is every to every turn you draw four cards and you have six energy Right a lot like a slay the spire kind of deal and you can play cards and the cards Upgrade this tower defense that you've set that you have right and after you're done playing all your cards and not doing anything else You you basically say go and the tower defense just sort of happens and you either make it or you don't make it Right and it gets harder as you go on and the thing that makes the strategy comes in is that?

203
00:17:10,611 --> 00:17:20,085
Scott: You can always take two cards that are the same level right and combine them to basically You know destroy them and get a card.

204
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:21,069
Scott: That's one level higher.

205
00:17:21,953 --> 00:17:25,087
Scott: All right, but your deck always stays at like at least 13 cards.

206
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:31,150
Scott: They keep adding rocks to it automatically which like the worst garbage cars that you you can use.

207
00:17:31,631 --> 00:17:54,508
Scott: but really what you do usually do with rocks is combine two rocks to get a level one card and Occasionally, there's all sorts of other mechanics in there that you know get some other cards and other stuff like that, but it's actually pretty fun because They give you like six Several characters to choose from and you're trying to beat the game with each character and all the characters play the game Somewhat significantly different.

208
00:17:54,609 --> 00:17:56,080
Rym: I mean slay the spires got that going on.

209
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:59,200
Rym: The four characters are very different in how they actually play.

210
00:17:59,803 --> 00:18:05,099
Scott: Yeah, the final character is the only one haven't beaten the game with yet They don't let you do the cards the normal way.

211
00:18:05,381 --> 00:18:10,460
Scott: They have a money system where you destroy cards to get money and then you buy cards with the money.

212
00:18:10,701 --> 00:18:18,114
Rym: Ooh, and it's yeah, it's like it's you know It's an extra dancer where you get the one character and instead of a rhythm game.

213
00:18:18,215 --> 00:18:21,319
Scott: It's just a puzzle game Mmm, yeah sort of like that.

214
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:29,487
Scott: Yeah And then you know the main menu of the game is a lot like Hypno space outlaw where it's like this desktop of a computer And it's I see evil Clippy.

215
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:32,740
Scott: Yeah, there's an evil Clippy and basically there's a plot.

216
00:18:32,881 --> 00:18:44,238
Scott: We're like, you know, you're you think you're playing a game But actually like you're you know torturing damned people in hell and maybe you're also a damned person in hell And you know that kind of thing, right?

217
00:18:45,323 --> 00:18:50,915
Scott: Once you beat the game with all six characters There's this ad you get a key every time you win with a new character.

218
00:18:51,276 --> 00:18:53,044
Scott: There's an admin thing You got to unlock.

219
00:18:53,085 --> 00:18:55,820
Scott: I haven't gotten the final key so I can't even spoil it if I wanted to.

220
00:18:57,161 --> 00:18:58,927
Scott: But it's you know, it's semi inscription.

221
00:18:59,027 --> 00:19:03,895
Scott: as with the with the plot and Hypno space outlaw ask with the you know desktop interface.

222
00:19:04,077 --> 00:19:08,393
Scott: so If that sounds like fun to you play it, it's not fun to me.

223
00:19:08,874 --> 00:19:10,521
Scott: It's not the most fun thing ever It's.

224
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:13,234
Scott: I don't think it's as good as any of those games that I mentioned.

225
00:19:13,254 --> 00:19:14,440
Scott: It's not as good as slay the spire.

226
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,007
Scott: It's not as good as it no space outlaw.

227
00:19:16,027 --> 00:19:21,499
Scott: It's not as good as you know, any of those ones But it takes elements from all of them and combines them.

228
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:25,935
Scott: So if you are an enjoyer of those you probably will still enjoy this.

229
00:19:25,995 --> 00:19:31,587
Scott: despite it not being as good It's still good enough that you know And it's in a bundle right now on Steam.

230
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:38,124
Scott: actually with this other game called 20 minutes to something What game was it on?

231
00:19:38,205 --> 00:19:43,940
Scott: second as I've played that other game also 20 minutes - I don't see a bundle here.

232
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,668
Scott: Oh wait, the hair is still done.

233
00:19:46,688 --> 00:19:57,380
Scott: Yeah, so 20 minutes till dawn is basically the same game as vampire survivors except Probably better because you actually you don't just automatically shoot you actually control the shooting.

234
00:19:58,521 --> 00:20:06,546
Scott: It's got a good aesthetic - yeah, but it's basically 20 minutes till dawn is bait is like 90% the same game as Vampire survivor.

235
00:20:06,586 --> 00:20:13,770
Scott: Yeah, so if you like vampire survivors Like I played vampire survivors up until they added like the gold system to it And then I was like.

236
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:14,479
Scott: that's enough of that.

237
00:20:14,962 --> 00:20:20,142
Scott: But it's like if you want more of that, but you don't want the exact same game It's like is another one of those.

238
00:20:20,382 --> 00:20:23,106
Scott: Yeah, so you can get a bundle together if you really want.

239
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:29,964
Rym: but anyway things Of the day I just bumped into this.

240
00:20:30,045 --> 00:20:31,110
Rym: I thought it was super cute.

241
00:20:31,391 --> 00:20:41,987
Rym: It's a little animation about Hobson a Miku set to the Adam on a Gucci song about Hobson a Miku And it just got stuck in my head and the animations super cute and she's hiding in your Wi-Fi.

242
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:42,549
Rym: That's all I got.

243
00:20:43,211 --> 00:20:48,003
Scott: Yeah, I gotta say though that like, you know Miku being still being around.

244
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:57,334
Rym: Oh, yeah, Miku was a precursor I think every we said a lot about what Miku foretold for the future and Yeah It's still happening.

245
00:20:57,454 --> 00:20:58,377
Rym: because real right

246
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:15,054
Scott: but like that's just an you know, I've been thinking lately that like You know of all the animes right that there are That you know our sci-fi and of course sci-fi is are always telling the futures, right and Saying um play gods and such and such.

247
00:21:15,675 --> 00:21:24,549
Scott: but I'm feeling that you know, the world we're in right now is Probably closer to macross plus Any any other anime world right?

248
00:21:24,569 --> 00:21:28,280
Scott: Yeah all the animes that's the one that got it the most right, right?

249
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,545
Scott: We're not in a Kira world.

250
00:21:29,806 --> 00:21:31,735
Scott: Yeah, you know, we're not in a.

251
00:21:32,237 --> 00:21:39,040
Rym: you know, we're We're like halfway between a macross world and a ghost in the shell world because they're both.

252
00:21:39,721 --> 00:21:41,566
Scott: Yeah, I think it's like we're really close.

253
00:21:41,706 --> 00:21:44,274
Scott: We are quite close to a macross plus world.

254
00:21:44,294 --> 00:21:44,815
Scott: Yeah,

255
00:21:44,855 --> 00:21:48,859
Rym: I mean Hobson a Miku is Real and is out there

256
00:21:49,806 --> 00:21:51,619
Scott: like the stuff that's going on right now, so

257
00:21:52,561 --> 00:22:04,686
Rym: project a little bit into the future of Hobson a Miku like things coupled with large language models and there's gonna be entirely autonomous youtubers Intractorating kids into ridiculous nonsense,

258
00:22:04,706 --> 00:22:11,043
Scott: but the fact that we finally have something resembling an AI and it's entertainment focused Primarily.

259
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:17,794
Scott: Yeah, and it's moving away faster than most people expected it to like people You know people are using it to make music.

260
00:22:17,975 --> 00:22:22,784
Scott: Yeah, it's like Okay Thing of the day.

261
00:22:22,864 --> 00:22:26,196
Scott: so this person what was their name?

262
00:22:26,216 --> 00:22:31,173
Scott: doo-doo-doo Eric Wernquist, I'm gonna guess.

263
00:22:31,234 --> 00:22:32,540
Scott: maybe they're Swedish, right?

264
00:22:33,681 --> 00:22:36,090
Scott: With a name like Wernquist, but they might not be they might.

265
00:22:36,211 --> 00:22:38,620
Scott: you know, who knows but they made a short film.

266
00:22:38,902 --> 00:22:40,239
Scott: It's basically five minutes long.

267
00:22:40,743 --> 00:22:52,580
Scott: The short film is called one revolution per minute And it's about a space station that turns that one revolution per minute and creates one half G's of gravity with its turning artificial gravity.

268
00:22:53,521 --> 00:22:54,751
Scott: And it's really just.

269
00:22:54,952 --> 00:22:55,860
Scott: you're watching, you know.

270
00:22:56,041 --> 00:23:18,580
Scott: They basically rendered the space station in 3d right that there's a fictional one that they made and they did a really good job of it and It's sort of basically giving you a tour of the space station While there's a narrator speaking and nobody's on the space station, right or you know, please doesn't appear anyone's on it And you may see just looking around it, you know, they're showing off the good big fancy job They did rendering this thing and modeling it.

271
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:31,558
Scott: and while a narrator you know is sort of Giving sort of like a welcome to the space station like the thing you would hear if you had just landed and docked and got On board and it's you know, is that for five minutes?

272
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:45,028
Scott: But I got to say this would make a great intro to like a Bioshock esque video game, you know type of You know, that's what it feels like.

273
00:23:45,069 --> 00:23:45,209
Scott: like.

274
00:23:45,289 --> 00:23:50,867
Scott: it feels like you're watching the intro video to Something shocked the video game.

275
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:53,395
Rym: Yeah, I'm like where you're gonna be where the whole games.

276
00:23:53,495 --> 00:23:55,724
Rym: and then it's like well good luck You're on your own.

277
00:23:55,745 --> 00:24:03,120
Scott: the whole game is about to be you on this space station Exploring it figuring it out Metroiding who knows what the hell, right?

278
00:24:04,062 --> 00:24:07,019
Scott: But it's just a movie it's not a game that's it.

279
00:24:07,261 --> 00:24:08,132
Rym: So not that.

280
00:24:08,152 --> 00:24:18,770
Rym: but you know Not a waste of five minutes of your day to watch this in the meta moment the GeekNights book club book Which we will do Shortly after the next book comes out.

281
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:20,515
Rym: and we've read it which won't be too long away.

282
00:24:20,936 --> 00:24:22,580
Rym: the murder bot diaries.

283
00:24:22,821 --> 00:24:26,415
Rym: I have read four point nine murder bots.

284
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,595
Scott: I Read all of them except for the one that isn't out yet.

285
00:24:29,978 --> 00:24:37,337
Rym: Yep To the individual who said that the fifth book dragged and was long and the humans were annoying I think I have the exact opposite opinion.

286
00:24:37,358 --> 00:24:46,492
Rym: that touched into the kinds of things that I am into and Now that I have a more context on what alien remnants are.

287
00:24:46,512 --> 00:24:51,694
Rym: Yeah, it's just the alien aliens universe This is just the alien aliens universe pretty much straight up.

288
00:24:52,237 --> 00:24:59,502
Rym: Yeah, obviously Yeah, but it it basically hits you over the head with that in the fifth book, especially the whole yeah All the corporations.

289
00:24:59,763 --> 00:25:10,860
Rym: the only thing the only thing they agree on as these corporate libertarian hell companies Is that nobody's allowed to fuck with aliens because they're too dangerous alien shit too dangerous.

290
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:13,379
Rym: You need permits and we and no one ever gets a permit.

291
00:25:15,381 --> 00:25:22,007
Rym: That's uh, that's the alien world right there and great Chris is definitely the kind of company that would send a ship to go do something it shouldn't.

292
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:26,093
Rym: Otherwise, we're gonna be a Pax West Pax West.

293
00:25:26,113 --> 00:25:27,299
Rym: we were at Pax unplugged.

294
00:25:27,721 --> 00:25:31,700
Rym: I haven't posted the news yet with the link cuz I'm waiting for the pack schedule to go up so I can link to it.

295
00:25:31,981 --> 00:25:44,535
Rym: We will be live at Pax unplugged with a panel a brand new panel mastering game mechanics worker placement, we're gonna talk about nothing but worker placement mechanics for 59 minutes.

296
00:25:45,981 --> 00:25:46,965
Rym: Gonna be glorious.

297
00:25:46,985 --> 00:25:50,520
Rym: I think we have more than 59 minutes worth of stuff to say.

298
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,788
Rym: So we already got to figure out how to pare that down.

299
00:25:53,149 --> 00:25:54,193
Rym: We will also be doing

300
00:25:54,494 --> 00:25:56,100
Scott: to make the GeekNights' website

301
00:25:56,664 --> 00:25:57,167
Rym: Live

302
00:25:57,671 --> 00:26:01,204
Scott: this weekend, maybe We'll say

303
00:26:01,566 --> 00:26:10,340
Rym: the only thing I got to do this weekend is I think at 6 a.m I have to do a practice run with my marathon or running team in Central Park and run 18 miles in a group.

304
00:26:11,301 --> 00:26:14,434
Scott: I may attempt to bike to an apple orchard, but maybe not.

305
00:26:14,595 --> 00:26:14,996
Rym: Yeah.

306
00:26:15,458 --> 00:26:20,064
Rym: Yeah, we'll see I. hopefully it looks like the wildfire smoke is not gonna hang around too long So I should be fine for this.

307
00:26:20,586 --> 00:26:23,016
Rym: our second event at Pax unplugged will be.

308
00:26:23,036 --> 00:26:23,819
Scott: there was another event.

309
00:26:23,899 --> 00:26:27,231
Rym: Okay Oh, yeah, we have a long slot in the learn and play.

310
00:26:27,251 --> 00:26:28,637
Scott: I thought that I thought that that met him.

311
00:26:28,857 --> 00:26:38,877
Rym: it was oh, yeah Because we will also be doing a learn and play And win meaning we're gonna teach strategy for real on the basics of trick-taking games.

312
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:45,660
Rym: We're gonna teach whist And have you all play like one hand a whist but not a whole game a whist cuz whist is literally obsolete.

313
00:26:46,287 --> 00:26:47,339
Rym: Then we're gonna teach hearts.

314
00:26:47,841 --> 00:26:53,259
Rym: Then we're gonna play a 40-point hand of hearts with everybody and then we're gonna play the wizard.

315
00:26:54,025 --> 00:26:58,660
Rym: Yeah, I Feel like that cover is all like the core types of mechanics.

316
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:05,200
Rym: We can teach people around like what cards to shove into some idiots hand so they lose hearts like that kind of advice.

317
00:27:05,261 --> 00:27:08,847
Rym: It'll be a good time Here, would you like some high spades?

318
00:27:09,108 --> 00:27:10,513
Rym: Would you like all my high clubs?

319
00:27:10,533 --> 00:27:10,553
Scott: I?

320
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:12,966
Scott: Have a problem.

321
00:27:13,512 --> 00:27:16,308
Scott: I Did not push record until three minutes ago.

322
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:18,355
Rym: Oh, let me put a little marker there.

323
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:25,200
Rym: I Can salvage audio of you from the discord, it'll just be slightly shitty.

324
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:33,810
Rym: So for any of you listening at home the listener the the audio of Scott Before this point will sound before it before three minutes ago.

325
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:36,236
Rym: Well sound somewhat bad, but it'll be fine.

326
00:27:36,276 --> 00:27:36,797
Rym: Don't sweat it.

327
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,086
Rym: Oh God, I changed the volume.

328
00:27:39,146 --> 00:27:40,152
Rym: I'm gonna have to run a filter.

329
00:27:40,192 --> 00:27:40,775
Rym: I can handle that.

330
00:27:40,936 --> 00:27:42,762
Rym: Anyway, no biggie I will.

331
00:27:42,822 --> 00:27:44,208
Rym: I can talk about that in the stinger.

332
00:27:44,228 --> 00:27:48,594
Rym: Ah Let's just get right into it.

333
00:27:48,716 --> 00:27:52,794
Rym: so Counter-strike is the game.

334
00:27:52,955 --> 00:27:54,060
Scott: I'm trying to think of games.

335
00:27:54,943 --> 00:28:01,020
Scott: Did an episode on counter-strike exclamation point on June 13th 2006?

336
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,220
Scott: So in GeekNights wasn't even a year old, right?

337
00:28:04,201 --> 00:28:06,993
Scott: then we did an episode and counter-strike go.

338
00:28:07,094 --> 00:28:10,998
Scott: first thoughts only in 2012 so six years after that.

339
00:28:11,018 --> 00:28:15,880
Scott: so So we did an episode on counter-strike when it was six years old.

340
00:28:16,301 --> 00:28:21,838
Scott: We did an episode and counter-strike go when it was brand new and counter-strike as a whole was 12 years old.

341
00:28:22,219 --> 00:28:25,966
Scott: right now counter-strike is 23 years old.

342
00:28:26,207 --> 00:28:33,879
Rym: Yep, and when we did that episode on counter-strike in 2006 we had already been playing counter-strike for six years, right?

343
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:43,271
Scott: But yeah, we're doing an episode on counter-strike when it's 23 years old and for its 23rd anniversary I guess close to it in its 23rd anniversary year.

344
00:28:43,652 --> 00:28:47,420
Scott: They have released counter-strike 2.

345
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,968
Rym: Yep, so the progression is interesting.

346
00:28:49,988 --> 00:28:53,478
Scott: Not 2.0, just 2.0 because you know Valve can't count to three.

347
00:28:53,538 --> 00:28:54,180
Scott: So this is the end.

348
00:28:55,581 --> 00:28:56,083
Scott: This is it.

349
00:28:56,625 --> 00:28:57,950
Rym: This is the last counter-strike.

350
00:28:58,171 --> 00:28:58,632
Scott: That's right.

351
00:28:58,652 --> 00:28:59,937
Scott: They don't know how to count to three.

352
00:28:59,977 --> 00:29:00,559
Scott: This is the end.

353
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:05,320
Rym: Granted I still do believe that half-life Alex is effectively half-life 3.

354
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,852
Rym: It's just they couldn't sell it to enough people because VR is not enough.

355
00:29:07,872 --> 00:29:09,400
Rym: that doesn't have enough adoption.

356
00:29:09,924 --> 00:29:12,120
Rym: Anyway, it is the best half-life game.

357
00:29:12,421 --> 00:29:20,691
Scott: The first thing you need to know about counter-strike 2 and this is probably most of what there is to talk about actually is that You get it for free you get it.

358
00:29:21,254 --> 00:29:22,660
Scott: Well, you get it, right?

359
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,467
Scott: It's like it is basically it.

360
00:29:24,528 --> 00:29:27,340
Scott: they removed counter-strike go from the face of the earth.

361
00:29:27,581 --> 00:29:30,600
Scott: It basically is taking up the same spot in the steam store.

362
00:29:31,081 --> 00:29:33,630
Scott: So if you already had counter-strike go congrats.

363
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:36,539
Scott: you now have counter-strike 2 and you don't have counter-strike.

364
00:29:36,579 --> 00:29:38,247
Scott: go Nobody has counter-strike.

365
00:29:38,267 --> 00:29:40,698
Scott: go it is go on right.

366
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:41,140
Scott: Goodbye.

367
00:29:43,221 --> 00:29:50,763
Rym: Thousands of Nerds who are specific about that particular version suddenly cried out in anger cried out in anguish and were suddenly Silenced.

368
00:29:50,803 --> 00:29:53,800
Scott: and I gotta say like I understand kind of why they did that.

369
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,574
Scott: But also it's kind of bullshit right from a preservation standpoint from.

370
00:29:57,795 --> 00:29:59,100
Scott: I bought that game standpoint.

371
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:03,074
Scott: Like imagine if I bought Mario 3 the counter-strike go also free to play.

372
00:30:03,094 --> 00:30:05,584
Scott: I Don't know.

373
00:30:05,624 --> 00:30:06,929
Rym: I think I'm pretty sure.

374
00:30:06,989 --> 00:30:08,153
Scott: I think that we can.

375
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:11,840
Scott: the problem is is I think what they've done Is that because we had counter-strike?

376
00:30:12,401 --> 00:30:13,805
Scott: Back in the day as a mod.

377
00:30:14,086 --> 00:30:18,560
Scott: We got it for free and because of that we've had it for free since then Free.

378
00:30:18,621 --> 00:30:26,996
Scott: I think that at some point other people had to buy Counter-strike like to get in and once you're in you're in.

379
00:30:27,076 --> 00:30:27,619
Scott: but we were in.

380
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,411
Scott: We were sort of in at the beginning with it.

381
00:30:30,431 --> 00:30:32,400
Rym: forget that there was also counter-strike source.

382
00:30:33,261 --> 00:30:35,957
Rym: Yeah, yeah, what was interesting, but that still exists.

383
00:30:36,037 --> 00:30:36,540
Scott: That's not gone.

384
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,858
Rym: Yeah, but what's funny is first I could tell no one plays it.

385
00:30:39,561 --> 00:30:40,343
Scott: No, why would you think?

386
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:43,792
Rym: but counter-strike one six still has a lot of players.

387
00:30:44,153 --> 00:30:45,115
Scott: Yes, that still exists.

388
00:30:45,236 --> 00:30:48,999
Scott: Anyway, so That's kind of BS.

389
00:30:49,221 --> 00:31:22,300
Scott: Another thing that I've seen people bring up this kind of BS is that because it takes up the same spot in the steam store regardless of counter-strike go still existing or not all of all of the reviews for a counter-strike go apply to Counter-strike 2. and if you were to filter If you were to filter the steam store and Sort of separate the reviews for counter that since counter-strike 2 was released since when counters You know and remove all the counter-strike go reviews counter-strike 2 actually has mixed reviews.

390
00:31:22,824 --> 00:31:26,750
Scott: But if you look at the store right now Let's look at the store right now.

391
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:35,131
Scott: actually and let's see counter-strike 2 store page Because all the counter-strike go reviews are mixed in.

392
00:31:35,252 --> 00:31:44,660
Scott: it has mostly positive and very positive Whereas if you didn't include those old reviews from 2012 onwards, it would be mixed instead.

393
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:51,300
Scott: So whether I don't not saying I agree or disagree with the mixed review, but just that hey It is like a new engine.

394
00:31:51,844 --> 00:31:55,626
Scott: It's you know, a lot of things are similar But also not is it?

395
00:31:55,927 --> 00:31:59,600
Scott: is it disingenuous to apply those reviews to the new game?

396
00:32:00,262 --> 00:32:01,164
Scott: It's a controversy.

397
00:32:01,365 --> 00:32:05,036
Scott: this is something, you know, I don't care too much about it, but it is a thing though.

398
00:32:05,317 --> 00:32:13,640
Rym: fortnight has Just versions that change more than counter-strike 2 changed over counter-strike 1 6 just like randomly on a Tuesday.

399
00:32:14,487 --> 00:32:21,469
Rym: Yeah, it's right Like Galactus shows up and kills everybody and then spider-man's there and then a bunch of weapons are gone and there's a new vehicle and the Maps totally different.

400
00:32:22,176 --> 00:32:29,109
Scott: Yep Anyway, so counter-strike 2. we played it for quite a session and then Rym kept playing Because I got.

401
00:32:29,169 --> 00:32:33,066
Rym: I'm gonna admit right now Overwatch is my primary like.

402
00:32:33,327 --> 00:32:43,337
Scott: right now the game I will default to if I want a competitive series experience is still overwatch But I see the fight that basically puts what likely to be the final overwatch championship just happened, Florida one.

403
00:32:43,578 --> 00:32:45,066
Rym: Yeah You know, I never.

404
00:32:45,086 --> 00:32:45,971
Scott: it's probably the end.

405
00:32:46,052 --> 00:32:54,440
Rym: It's funny because I love Watching the matches of overwatch league, but I do not care at all about the people or the teams or who wins.

406
00:32:54,941 --> 00:32:57,991
Rym: I just watch the matches because they're the best overwatch players on earth.

407
00:32:58,332 --> 00:33:04,978
Rym: and that is how I get better because it is you can Watch them from one of their eyes and see what the fuck they're doing to be better than me.

408
00:33:08,011 --> 00:33:12,612
Rym: So I guess Counter-strike 2 I didn't play a lot of counter-strike God go like.

409
00:33:12,632 --> 00:33:18,180
Rym: I actually didn't like counter-strike go that much as it went on Partly big for a lot of reasons that are kind of irrelevant to this.

410
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,773
Scott: I mean I didn't actually didn't hate counter-strike go.

411
00:33:20,853 --> 00:33:25,760
Scott: the thing is and it's you know The same thing is gonna keep me from playing counter-strike 2. is it just like?

412
00:33:27,004 --> 00:33:30,432
Scott: I'm not any good at these games I just get I just.

413
00:33:30,472 --> 00:33:31,840
Scott: it's like back in the day.

414
00:33:32,181 --> 00:33:37,560
Scott: It's like I got instant headshot at a lot even when there was all kinds of cheating going on, right?

415
00:33:38,645 --> 00:33:42,205
Scott: But not it's not as much as I do now Like when we play counter-strike 2.

416
00:33:42,205 --> 00:33:46,960
Scott: I was absolutely ineffective a debuts bear against real people.

417
00:33:47,201 --> 00:33:48,547
Scott: I was barely playing.

418
00:33:48,567 --> 00:33:52,283
Rym: Yeah, no, I don't think you had enough matchmaking data So it's hard.

419
00:33:52,323 --> 00:33:57,700
Scott: No, I probably I could probably play a bunch until the matchmaking put me against other garbage players.

420
00:33:57,802 --> 00:33:58,719
Scott: You can't click on heads.

421
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:05,560
Rym: I played about have five matches and then suddenly everyone and every server I joined in casual was about my skill level.

422
00:34:06,163 --> 00:34:07,027
Scott: Right, but it's like.

423
00:34:07,108 --> 00:34:13,237
Scott: it's not the game's fault that the kind of game It is was once the kind of game for me and is now not right.

424
00:34:13,257 --> 00:34:20,378
Rym: Yep Well part of it too I think is that unlike you like I have been playing FPS is pretty like competitive.

425
00:34:20,478 --> 00:34:25,145
Rym: FPS is pretty much continuously since 2000. like I never stopped.

426
00:34:25,205 --> 00:34:31,605
Rym: I've been playing them just regularly for 20 years not counting the 10 years I played them before that.

427
00:34:31,746 --> 00:34:33,351
Rym: so I just kept that going.

428
00:34:33,431 --> 00:34:40,280
Rym: even though I am older and I'm slower I am finding I can still click on heads pretty well if I just continue to play and practice.

429
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,699
Scott: But it also doesn't help that even when I was playing FPS games very regularly, right?

430
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,737
Scott: I wasn't really that good at clicking on heads even on my best day.

431
00:34:48,757 --> 00:34:57,659
Rym: Yeah But I guess the danger to me is that when we play Counter-Strike 2 together I had thought I had a lot to say for the review and I didn't think I'd play it that much.

432
00:34:58,061 --> 00:35:06,994
Rym: But then I played some more and I hit a moment and I realized for me at least as someone who has played Every version of Counter-Strike kind of

433
00:35:07,014 --> 00:35:08,040
Scott: played every version

434
00:35:08,522 --> 00:35:12,680
Rym: Yeah, but I played them all kind of a lot like I kept playing them even when you stop playing them.

435
00:35:14,701 --> 00:35:17,648
Rym: Counter-Strike 2 is a breath of fresh air.

436
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:20,496
Rym: and I say that because Counter-Strike go.

437
00:35:20,757 --> 00:35:38,933
Rym: when you went into the game They put so much crap and all these different modes and all this bullshit around the skins like it was so front and center and the Missions and all the like stuff to trick you into buying a key to open a thing That it was like a chaotic mess like how Fortnite was.

438
00:35:39,615 --> 00:35:50,999
Rym: and when I wanted to just play Counter-Strike like I remembered from the old days of 1.6 and swords hanging out at RIT Really couldn't find a server or a group of people who played that way and it just wasn't that fun.

439
00:35:51,702 --> 00:35:57,686
Rym: Counter-Strike 2. when you launch it you get a completely empty screen And you just your guys standing there.

440
00:35:57,787 --> 00:36:06,816
Rym: you can click a button and there's a small number of modes that are basically the modes you want and everything kind of just works and all the cruft has been pushed aside.

441
00:36:06,876 --> 00:36:15,819
Rym: unless you look for it and When you do click into casual mode Most of the time the server you join with the people you play with.

442
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,168
Rym: It's about like how it was in the old days.

443
00:36:20,529 --> 00:36:21,772
Rym: Like it's just refreshing.

444
00:36:21,833 --> 00:36:23,116
Rym: people are playing Counter-Strike.

445
00:36:23,297 --> 00:36:24,420
Rym: They're mostly trying to win.

446
00:36:26,302 --> 00:36:34,085
Rym: The feel is just very different from every feel I got with the people I was playing Counter-Strike go with And I'm gonna play it a lot.

447
00:36:34,627 --> 00:36:34,948
Rym: They've

448
00:36:35,009 --> 00:36:51,580
Scott: made a lot of changes to the game that are Like, you know significant but also it's like, you know, the game has been around so long that like they're really polishing some some You know like really specific things but in a way that makes a big difference like the way the smoke works now.

449
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,248
Scott: They made it volumetric smoke.

450
00:36:53,409 --> 00:36:55,500
Scott: It looks so good, right?

451
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:00,540
Scott: It's like bullets go through the smoke sort of you know, and I push make little holes in the smoke, right?

452
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,279
Scott: It's like they are really like the amount of polish that has gone on.

453
00:37:04,299 --> 00:37:05,967
Scott: now Just one example the shadows.

454
00:37:06,229 --> 00:37:12,392
Rym: the shadows are fully dynamic and look amazing But they're also game impacting because now there's some prices like, you know, right?

455
00:37:12,412 --> 00:37:14,620
Scott: We're not talking about just graphical shininess.

456
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:21,460
Rym: here We're talking about things that actually matter for the game Like the smoke is a big deal because smoke is a big part of serious Counter-Strike play.

457
00:37:22,401 --> 00:37:28,440
Scott: The way the mall the way the fire Molotov cocktails now work like you can get them to you can set water on fire with.

458
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:40,659
Rym: I was in a map and I was hiding in a spot that I used to like to hide in back at RIT because the map Hasn't changed much and I see Overhead a shadow of what is clearly a terrorist just goes boop boop boop.

459
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:47,541
Rym: So I know a terrorist is standing right above me and I just aim my stair-og straight up and shot him through the floor and killed Him.

460
00:37:48,283 --> 00:37:49,126
Scott: Yeah, it's like this.

461
00:37:49,749 --> 00:37:52,860
Scott: these, you know, you think oh the guy doesn't it matters.

462
00:37:52,960 --> 00:38:07,060
Rym: Yeah, the sound the soundscape the sound whatever they're doing for the sound Counter-Strike was notable even in the 1/6 era for being Extremely good at helping you locate people because sound is a big part of what makes the game fun.

463
00:38:07,401 --> 00:38:08,265
Rym: You're sneaking around.

464
00:38:08,325 --> 00:38:10,012
Rym: walking versus running is a big deal.

465
00:38:10,393 --> 00:38:11,960
Rym: hearings us one foot step.

466
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:14,403
Rym: It could be the difference between winning and losing a match.

467
00:38:14,904 --> 00:38:26,420
Rym: the sound design to locate where someone is in this game is Somehow better and I can't articulate how but it is hyper realistic in a weird way that just works.

468
00:38:26,723 --> 00:38:31,331
Scott: It feels really natural Yeah, but it's it's still the same game.

469
00:38:31,411 --> 00:38:32,836
Scott: it's counter-strike you're bombing.

470
00:38:33,137 --> 00:38:33,819
Scott: you're right.

471
00:38:34,683 --> 00:38:40,230
Scott: The things is is that you know, you talked about all the how clean it is And I do appreciate that the menus and everything.

472
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:42,720
Scott: It's like just really straightforward and not a big mess.

473
00:38:43,162 --> 00:38:48,712
Scott: However, it's like there were a lot of modes in Counter-Strike go that are now gone.

474
00:38:48,772 --> 00:38:54,534
Rym: Yep, the modes like quick mode I was even called the mode where like the magic war games or something.

475
00:38:54,574 --> 00:38:56,640
Scott: It's like you can't play gun game right now.

476
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:57,905
Scott: It's like they took it out.

477
00:38:58,005 --> 00:38:59,169
Scott: Yeah, so it's not there.

478
00:38:59,451 --> 00:39:00,635
Rym: We know gun game will come back.

479
00:39:00,715 --> 00:39:01,298
Rym: I'm 100% confident.

480
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:05,699
Scott: I'm sure it'll come back eventually, but it's like you could play it and now you can't.

481
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,930
Scott: It's like I paid for csgo or someone paid for csgo.

482
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:11,437
Scott: And now that the mode is just gone too bad.

483
00:39:11,458 --> 00:39:13,364
Scott: Yeah There's also.

484
00:39:13,465 --> 00:39:17,220
Scott: it's like when you choose modes, it's like you're choosing like these map sets.

485
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:23,077
Scott: It's like map set one map set two and then like dust is your third us to dust specific to.

486
00:39:23,097 --> 00:39:30,359
Scott: yeah It's like you can't just like choose the map you want directly and that's like you set up a server something right?

487
00:39:30,399 --> 00:39:35,020
Scott: It's like Like if you only want to play nuke you really can't do that.

488
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:39,900
Scott: You have to it's like nuke and another map or in the same bundle and you're gonna sort of just be playing those maps.

489
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:42,497
Rym: Yeah, you get a vote because it'll keep groups together.

490
00:39:42,598 --> 00:39:44,807
Scott: generally Yeah, but you can't just play like.

491
00:39:45,068 --> 00:39:47,839
Scott: you can't pick one map that's not dust to and play it on repeat.

492
00:39:47,859 --> 00:39:54,669
Rym: though What's interesting is unless you joined a very specific servers back in the day in the one six era There weren't many ways to do that then either.

493
00:39:54,789 --> 00:39:57,680
Rym: like there were a handful of servers that were map specific.

494
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:08,160
Scott: Like there was a default the default counter-strike service back in the day Just had all like every single default map on a rotation in order except our server, which was just fy ic world.

495
00:40:08,541 --> 00:40:13,040
Scott: Well, that's because all the cpu could handle was icy world with like a smaller number of players.

496
00:40:13,783 --> 00:40:23,031
Rym: So the other thing that's notable and this is something that overwatch also did I think is very important Relative to the powers of modern game pcs and relative to how good this game looks.

497
00:40:23,452 --> 00:40:29,627
Scott: counter-strike 2 will basically run on a potato Yeah, so on the one hand they did.

498
00:40:29,647 --> 00:40:34,260
Scott: I believe they increased the requirements somewhat, right?

499
00:40:34,801 --> 00:40:35,526
Scott: But you're right.

500
00:40:35,586 --> 00:40:37,520
Scott: It only requires eight gigs of ram.

501
00:40:37,861 --> 00:40:44,263
Scott: I didn't check what the requirements were before but it requires eight gigs of ram, which is like Any computer.

502
00:40:44,303 --> 00:40:50,520
Scott: you buy the cheapest computer available geforce 610 m or better.

503
00:40:51,446 --> 00:40:59,480
Scott: so basically Any old laptop that you buy any computer you buy new in the united like in the united states is going to play counter-strike.

504
00:40:59,941 --> 00:41:01,767
Scott: Well, it's gonna be way above, you know, it can't run it.

505
00:41:02,028 --> 00:41:04,577
Rym: my htpc because it has a gtx 450 m.

506
00:41:06,361 --> 00:41:19,095
Scott: Yeah, so the the minimum cpu required is the core I. uh core All right, so the core i5 750. wait, is that a nahalem number?

507
00:41:19,135 --> 00:41:20,420
Rym: that looks like a nahalem number.

508
00:41:20,761 --> 00:41:22,747
Scott: That's a. so you got to imagine right?

509
00:41:22,767 --> 00:41:26,078
Scott: We're currently on what the intel 14 series, right?

510
00:41:26,118 --> 00:41:31,088
Scott: Yeah Uh, and so if this is a 700 That means this.

511
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:33,849
Rym: I think that's nahalam That this came.

512
00:41:33,869 --> 00:41:43,577
Scott: this cpu came out in Yep, so you can see you can have a cpu That's older than counter-strike.

513
00:41:43,678 --> 00:41:47,771
Scott: go and play counter-strike Two.

514
00:41:48,171 --> 00:41:49,975
Rym: now even the recommended requirements.

515
00:41:50,095 --> 00:41:52,420
Rym: They basically like cpu never matters.

516
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:56,900
Rym: But uh a geforce 2070 is what they recommend which is better than what I got.

517
00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:06,120
Rym: I didn't turn the settings all up to max because I only got a 1080 still Mm-hmm, but with a 1080 without everything set to the max it looks phenomenal.

518
00:42:08,321 --> 00:42:09,825
Scott: Yeah, um, but you know, you'll still.

519
00:42:09,846 --> 00:42:13,738
Scott: I i'd love to try and get the exact computer like an i5.

520
00:42:13,798 --> 00:42:18,980
Scott: seven With eight make gigs of ram and see how counter-strike two runs on it, right?

521
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,419
Rym: I guess I could turn all my settings down to the minimum just to see what it would look like.

522
00:42:23,182 --> 00:42:26,674
Scott: Yeah, i'm sure that's probably would be similar but your monitor is too high.

523
00:42:26,714 --> 00:42:27,557
Scott: res is the problem.

524
00:42:27,577 --> 00:42:29,244
Scott: Yeah, right You I don't know.

525
00:42:29,284 --> 00:42:32,318
Scott: if you'd be able to do 1080p with that setup you might have to do lower than that.

526
00:42:33,061 --> 00:42:36,132
Rym: But I guess 720 in terms of the game like reviewing the game.

527
00:42:36,192 --> 00:42:37,175
Rym: I mean, it's counter-strike.

528
00:42:37,195 --> 00:42:41,258
Scott: There's only so much to say but The reason you don't already know counter-strike.

529
00:42:41,298 --> 00:42:43,869
Scott: I mean It's a team-based fps.

530
00:42:44,211 --> 00:42:47,084
Scott: There's bomb mode and there's Hostage mode.

531
00:42:47,185 --> 00:42:50,920
Scott: Yeah, it's usually five on five, but you could have different numbers, right?

532
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:53,730
Scott: When you die you die until the next round.

533
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:56,120
Scott: there's no respawning like quake which was basically.

534
00:42:56,120 --> 00:43:01,720
Scott: You know, I don't know if counter-strike was the first game to do that ever but it was the first game that made that a thing.

535
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,212
Rym: Right, you know what else did it?

536
00:43:03,273 --> 00:43:03,495
Rym: did it?

537
00:43:03,636 --> 00:43:04,100
Rym: action quick?

538
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:09,219
Rym: Do well action quick to the default mode was basically the same as counter-strike, but there was no bomb, right?

539
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:22,153
Scott: Right, and then basically you play until either one team is completely dead Or the bomb goes off or the hostages are rescued Or even if everyone's dead on the terrorist team who has the bomb.

540
00:43:22,414 --> 00:43:28,740
Scott: if the bomb has been planted and it goes off The terrorists can still win even if they all die and do basically a suicide bombing mission

541
00:43:29,704 --> 00:43:29,826
Rym: Or

542
00:43:29,886 --> 00:43:30,554
Scott: old counter-strike

543
00:43:30,614 --> 00:43:35,560
Rym: at other ones Like did the did the vip make it to the chopper or did the terrorists escape the prison?

544
00:43:36,341 --> 00:43:39,653
Scott: And that's and mostly it's an fps where you're moving slowly.

545
00:43:39,693 --> 00:43:41,519
Scott: You're not moving like quake where it's fast.

546
00:43:42,282 --> 00:43:49,040
Scott: Uh, you start with the pistols in the first round and you earn money as the game goes on in sort of a snowball effect.

547
00:43:49,764 --> 00:43:59,512
Scott: Um where the winning team gets more money to buy better weapons They have a better chance to keep to maintain their advantage But you still get plenty of money if you lose and you can come back.

548
00:43:59,572 --> 00:44:01,600
Scott: It's not like a devastating difference.

549
00:44:02,401 --> 00:44:21,609
Scott: You can choose what weapons you want pistols sniper rifles submachine guns big machine guns grenades of various kinds armors and all sorts of stuff And all the weapons are not so realistic like arma or you know pubg But they're also not unrealistic like doom or quake.

550
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:22,632
Scott: yep, you know, they're.

551
00:44:23,153 --> 00:44:30,100
Scott: um, and the game is all about like Basically, you don't die in one shot, but you can if it's a like a head shot with a sniper rifle.

552
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:34,999
Rym: It's basically about like squad tactics like do when the shit hits the fan.

553
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:41,256
Rym: because you know The setting of counter-strike is the negotiation with the terrorist just failed and the swat team was just sent in.

554
00:44:41,297 --> 00:44:42,239
Rym: and that's when a match starts.

555
00:44:43,321 --> 00:44:46,375
Scott: Yep, or the swat team knows the terrorists are coming.

556
00:44:46,396 --> 00:44:48,467
Scott: the terrorists are like fuck it We're gonna blow this shit up here.

557
00:44:48,588 --> 00:44:53,600
Scott: come and that the you know It's that exact moment is when the game starts.

558
00:44:53,841 --> 00:44:59,180
Scott: So all the stuff that before and after it outside of a terrorist situation are not addressed by counter-strike.

559
00:44:59,361 --> 00:45:02,879
Rym: And I guess what struck me was in the casual modes of csgo.

560
00:45:05,061 --> 00:45:13,335
Rym: It was like people were just kind of running around like not actually really playing and it wasn't that fun I have found playing in casual and competitive mode.

561
00:45:13,375 --> 00:45:21,500
Rym: in the new counter-strike People are trying to win at about the same level as what I remember from RIT and It struck something in me.

562
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:27,050
Rym: I forgot how fun this game is when everyone's in the same At the same level and caring about the same amount.

563
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:36,380
Rym: because this game is fundamentally about moving as a squad Covering your teammates being tricky and trying to trap or ambush the other side.

564
00:45:36,701 --> 00:45:40,053
Rym: Because if you're not moving and someone comes around a corner who is moving?

565
00:45:40,334 --> 00:45:47,964
Rym: you were very likely able to kill them Because they won't be able to shoot you due to the fact that since they're moving their recoil is all over the place like they won't Be able to hit you.

566
00:45:48,346 --> 00:45:52,005
Rym: so like your friend moves forward while you cover them They hide and cover the window.

567
00:45:52,045 --> 00:46:01,180
Rym: while you sneak past you throw a flashbang everyone runs in and what the game is added is The radar is a lot a little better and more focused the ray.

568
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:06,139
Scott: I can't say that in old counter-strikes the radar was always there, but I never used it.

569
00:46:06,219 --> 00:46:12,223
Scott: in fact I think there was a time where someone said someone told me to use the radar and I didn't realize it existed And you were

570
00:46:12,263 --> 00:46:15,780
Rym: like it's not there, and we're like yeah, it is look at the upper edge of screen, and you're like oh fuck

571
00:46:16,501 --> 00:46:17,704
Scott: Yeah, that was there the whole time.

572
00:46:17,724 --> 00:46:23,769
Scott: I never noticed it, but also that radar was so useless even if you did look at it It was so different.

573
00:46:23,789 --> 00:46:24,839
Scott: It was not a good radar.

574
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,065
Scott: It was like just.

575
00:46:26,106 --> 00:46:31,247
Scott: it was like using the thing and freaking aliens right we're just dots And it doesn't show you like is that guy?

576
00:46:31,307 --> 00:46:32,491
Scott: is that dot in the hallway?

577
00:46:32,531 --> 00:46:33,916
Scott: is that dot up down right?

578
00:46:34,217 --> 00:46:35,060
Scott: the new radar?

579
00:46:35,661 --> 00:46:43,820
Scott: Was actually super useful, and I found myself looking at it a lot Maybe too much which is might be why I was getting shot and killed because I was looking at the radar.

580
00:46:44,761 --> 00:47:27,868
Rym: They've added pings, and I don't know how much of this might have been in csgo But I never remember seeing it and other ways to communicate beyond voice and and also some of the hierarchy of attention types of things that games like overwatch and real world things like fighter jets use like the modern science of Attention hierarchies of user experience design so that the game is giving you everything you need to Naturally coordinate with your team without actually having to say words in the microphone, and it is shockingly effective because Counter-Strike had a reputation partly because one of the first games to be popular like this online at scale of having a popular

581
00:47:27,868 --> 00:47:28,009
Scott: 23 years

582
00:47:29,412 --> 00:47:35,850
Rym: But in the old days like if there's voice chat or text chat people just being absolutely horrible in those chats.

583
00:47:36,532 --> 00:47:51,130
Rym: So far my experience in Counter-Strike 2 is that nobody's been horrible and teams are Coordinating at the level that required being in a ventrilo server in the old days Despite the fact that nobody is in voice and people are only using the nonverbal in-game communication.

584
00:47:51,652 --> 00:47:58,880
Scott: And you don't want to be employees because they assume that everyone else is gonna be a piece of shit And they don't want to yeah, but that nobody's in voice.

585
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:22,930
Rym: everyone's just using the the systems in the game and I've saw in casual matches at my like I guess I'm probably the lowest possible skill rank People were playing the high-level game of rotate between the bomb points or Coordinate and be a distraction like all the kinds of ploys and clever plays that you think you'd only see among serious players.

586
00:48:23,251 --> 00:48:29,387
Rym: I was seeing that for real and participating in it in casual games and that did not happen organically at any point.

587
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:30,947
Rym: playing Counter-Strike go over the years.

588
00:48:31,775 --> 00:48:36,659
Scott: So the question is should somebody Play Counter-Strike 2.

589
00:48:36,659 --> 00:48:41,530
Rym: I would say if you've never played a Counter-Strike You should play it just to see what the deal is with Counter-Strike.

590
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:44,319
Rym: If you it doesn't matter if you like it or not, it's been around for 23 years.

591
00:48:48,435 --> 00:48:49,710
Rym: There's something to it.

592
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:51,581
Rym: You at least need to understand what there is to it.

593
00:48:51,661 --> 00:48:52,949
Rym: Even if you decide it's not for you.

594
00:48:53,652 --> 00:49:09,969
Scott: well, there's actually a valve complete pack that is like 50 bucks that has basically a portal one portal to Team Fortress to Like every or the portals all the counter-strikes all the half-lives all the all the everything that about ricochets even in there.

595
00:49:12,312 --> 00:49:15,870
Scott: See, you know if you haven't if you have a computer and you haven't played all those games.

596
00:49:17,052 --> 00:49:28,169
Scott: But yeah, if you've never played a Counter-Strike even if you have no interest in it just Do it like one time like for you know, what 20 minutes just know how to counter-strikes under see what it is.

597
00:49:28,391 --> 00:49:30,450
Scott: Right, if you maybe you'll like it.

598
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:35,244
Scott: I don't know if you if you have counter-strikes in the past and have not in a while.

599
00:49:35,665 --> 00:49:36,809
Scott: Should you come back?

600
00:49:36,969 --> 00:49:42,590
Rym: Absolutely Yes, this is your best chance to see if it's still for you because I think a lot of people I guess

601
00:49:43,711 --> 00:49:52,018
Scott: Have the mood for it, right if you don't if you're not if you already know counter-strike and you're not it's like this is Counter-strike, it's not gonna be something different than what you remember.

602
00:49:52,439 --> 00:49:56,170
Scott: So if there's no counter-strike, I guess I'd the mood.

603
00:49:56,776 --> 00:49:57,786
Scott: Then here you go.

604
00:49:57,806 --> 00:50:00,850
Rym: I Not to get back into counter-strike.

605
00:50:01,092 --> 00:50:14,090
Rym: I feel I almost felt like I was gonna play it to review it But then it bit me in a way I didn't expect and I think other people may experience the same thing if you slowly fell off of counter-strike During the go era.

606
00:50:15,071 --> 00:50:22,592
Rym: This is a chance to see if you still like counter-strike because I feel like they have course corrected from the direction go was going Mmm-hmm.

607
00:50:23,055 --> 00:50:26,170
Rym: It just felt a lot more like old counter-strike, which I think was better.

608
00:50:27,210 --> 00:50:33,450
Scott: Hmm, and then I guess if you're already playing counter-strike, it's like, you know, you're already playing counter-strike all the time.

609
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:36,809
Scott: We don't you need to hear anything from us because we play counter-strike a lot less than you do.

610
00:50:37,232 --> 00:50:41,909
Rym: Yeah, I may be playing a lot better and there is a mode I think we should talk about briefly and we can end on that.

611
00:50:42,251 --> 00:50:46,710
Rym: There is a. you can make a local matchmaking group and this is a cool feature.

612
00:50:47,095 --> 00:50:55,290
Rym: More games should do this So you and all your friends can share one code and be in a group and it'll basically match make among just your friends.

613
00:50:56,331 --> 00:50:57,714
Rym: Yep, that's it.

614
00:50:57,774 --> 00:50:59,960
Rym: Like think about the ramifications of that.

615
00:51:00,931 --> 00:51:02,055
Scott: Well, it's like let's say we had.

616
00:51:02,437 --> 00:51:07,829
Scott: it only really comes into a play if you have a lot of friends I like enough to be able to fill a server.

617
00:51:08,613 --> 00:51:12,050
Scott: Right, it's like let's say you do have 10 friends at a LAN party, right?

618
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:17,610
Scott: It can basically line things up and get your teams pretty even right.

619
00:51:17,871 --> 00:51:22,113
Scott: And what if I don't know if it'll work if you have more than one server's worth of people Like?

620
00:51:22,133 --> 00:51:23,125
Scott: what if you have you know?

621
00:51:23,125 --> 00:51:26,513
Scott: 50 people at a LAN party and Everyone joins?

622
00:51:26,894 --> 00:51:27,656
Scott: is it going to match?

623
00:51:27,716 --> 00:51:33,586
Scott: make amongst the 50 people and they make like 10 teams that are balanced You know?

624
00:51:34,773 --> 00:51:35,259
Rym: Yeah, I don't know.

625
00:51:35,825 --> 00:51:38,625
Rym: Well, maybe I haven't actually tried it.

626
00:51:38,666 --> 00:51:39,370
Scott: I just read about it.

627
00:51:39,370 --> 00:51:39,450
Scott: They

628
00:51:39,490 --> 00:52:01,210
Rym: had the thing where if you played on a private server that you just spun up you could enable a mode where after every Match it would rebalance the teams based on which team did better and who was responsible for them being better to try to make the matches as even as it possibly can among the people playing and it was Actually really effective and allowed a lot of people who would otherwise bounce off of that match to keep playing.

629
00:52:01,751 --> 00:52:06,526
Scott: Yeah, but I got to say though, it's still don't if you're in a game that is not match made.

630
00:52:06,707 --> 00:52:09,861
Scott: well, yeah, right It's still the same game.

631
00:52:10,062 --> 00:52:14,524
Scott: one person who can click on heads You'll is gonna make their team win regardless of anything.

632
00:52:14,564 --> 00:52:17,552
Scott: the other nine players do So.

633
00:52:18,054 --> 00:52:27,004
Scott: but I got past that you might have to sit through a lot of games - until the matchmaking basically puts you up against nobody who can click on heads.

634
00:52:27,285 --> 00:52:40,230
Scott: or if you can click on heads You might be stuck clicking on a lot of heads and winning but Against people who are vastly inferior and not giving you a good challenge until you get ranked up and are against other click on heads people.

635
00:52:40,411 --> 00:52:47,055
Rym: I did revisit the old strategy of rather than just running out every match I hung back.

636
00:52:47,878 --> 00:52:49,244
Rym: I looked at who is good on the team.

637
00:52:49,284 --> 00:52:50,796
Scott: Let everyone else be the meat shield Yeah.

638
00:52:51,451 --> 00:52:52,816
Rym: But also I followed.

639
00:52:53,138 --> 00:53:06,130
Rym: like if a group of two people who were like near the top of the team and clearly knew what they were Doing were on my team I would follow them and Basically like cover them when they walk through dangerous places and just try to keep them alive.

640
00:53:06,532 --> 00:53:09,426
Rym: And that actually allowed me to be a productive useful member of my team

641
00:53:09,868 --> 00:53:13,762
Scott: and it also Is a good idea for lower skilled people and

642
00:53:13,863 --> 00:53:28,369
Rym: it also wanted reminded me of things I'd forgotten like where to hide and like what the good points that places to have a firefighter are and it It meant that I survived long enough to fucking remember how to play this game instead of when we play

643
00:53:29,253 --> 00:53:29,515
Scott: There.

644
00:53:29,616 --> 00:53:36,111
Scott: there are maps that I remember like, you know, Italy office dust - Etc.

645
00:53:36,231 --> 00:53:43,252
Scott: Yeah nuke, but they're also maps where if I did play them in their old versions, I do not remember It's really funny.

646
00:53:43,272 --> 00:53:44,516
Rym: inferno is one of the old maps.

647
00:53:44,536 --> 00:53:47,666
Rym: We played all the time, but it's I don't remember the layout well enough.

648
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:53,103
Rym: Yeah, it's so visually different that it's unrecognizable.

649
00:53:53,283 --> 00:53:58,129
Rym: if you don't like remember the continuity And I don't think you ever played inferno in the go.

650
00:53:58,471 --> 00:54:01,785
Scott: I definitely didn't play it well enough to remember it whenever I played.

651
00:54:02,186 --> 00:54:05,902
Scott: Yeah, if I did It's like I was I felt like a brand new map to me and I was lost

652
00:54:06,003 --> 00:54:11,870
Rym: even though it is the exact same map To the point that I hid in the spot I used to hide in the original days of that map and you know what?

653
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:15,370
Rym: It's still a great hiding spot and I won a couple matches by hiding there.

654
00:54:15,732 --> 00:54:17,601
Scott: We should mention that there is a practice mode.

655
00:54:17,682 --> 00:54:19,250
Scott: I did the practice mode against bots.

656
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:27,710
Scott: I don't know if you can change the bot difficulty Assume you can but the bots were so bad that I was just walking around mowing them down no problem.

657
00:54:27,971 --> 00:54:30,539
Scott: So, I don't know how much of a practice that is.

658
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:32,987
Scott: and if you can't change it you I guess you can.

659
00:54:33,027 --> 00:54:34,552
Scott: I just I'm Assuming you can.

660
00:54:34,592 --> 00:54:35,013
Scott: I don't know.

661
00:54:35,575 --> 00:54:39,988
Scott: and then there is also a deathmatch mode, which I got really confused at.

662
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:48,609
Scott: it's awful Because in the deathmatch mode there are terrorists and counter-terrorists, but it's not a team battle like you and you kill anyone.

663
00:54:48,649 --> 00:55:03,950
Scott: you see Deathmatch and when you spawn You like get a weapon, but you can still buy stuff in instead if you want to instead of what you're given And you get a few invincibility frames like it when you first spawned.

664
00:55:04,131 --> 00:55:15,330
Scott: So it's like on the one hand you can sort of get kills like when you're spawning But it's also super dangerous when you spawn if like someone's nearby and catches you as soon as your invincibility frames go away.

665
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:16,375
Rym: There was a moment.

666
00:55:16,496 --> 00:55:19,230
Rym: we both you didn't notice them every time either one of us spawn.

667
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:22,319
Rym: We just started counting the seconds and very rarely.

668
00:55:22,359 --> 00:55:24,566
Rym: Did we hit the number five before we die?

669
00:55:24,606 --> 00:55:25,930
Scott: Yeah, it's like right.

670
00:55:26,050 --> 00:55:32,529
Scott: It's like either when you spawn it you see someone and you get them because you had invincibility frames and they were on.

671
00:55:32,589 --> 00:55:34,856
Scott: they were Unready for you to spawn there.

672
00:55:34,876 --> 00:55:35,759
Scott: or they didn't notice you.

673
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:40,761
Scott: or be you spawn and die instantly because someone was waiting for invincibility frames to go away.

674
00:55:40,781 --> 00:55:43,634
Scott: Yeah, so It's not a great.

675
00:55:43,875 --> 00:55:45,743
Scott: it's not a great mode, right?

676
00:55:45,863 --> 00:55:46,746
Scott: I think it would be.

677
00:55:46,767 --> 00:55:50,525
Scott: you know They need to do something different for spawning.

678
00:55:50,645 --> 00:55:57,490
Scott: in a game Where you die so quickly and the map is so tight and there's so many people in the map when quake you spawn.

679
00:55:58,310 --> 00:56:02,306
Scott: Usually spot, you know, the spawn points are sort of on the edges of a big map.

680
00:56:02,386 --> 00:56:03,370
Scott: It's usually quiet there.

681
00:56:03,430 --> 00:56:08,890
Scott: That's not where people are going around collecting quad quad damages and rocket launchers, right?

682
00:56:09,553 --> 00:56:12,490
Scott: So you can usually spawn safely on a map full of players.

683
00:56:12,530 --> 00:56:17,670
Scott: Yeah, you you know, even with the invincibility frames you can't really spawn.

684
00:56:18,232 --> 00:56:20,906
Rym: I mean what they got to do is bring that gun game and team deathmatch.

685
00:56:20,946 --> 00:56:21,810
Rym: Those are the two modes.

686
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:22,532
Rym: Those are.

687
00:56:22,733 --> 00:56:23,636
Scott: those are much better.

688
00:56:24,157 --> 00:56:28,330
Rym: gun game is just like that was I think was that invented in counter-strike?

689
00:56:28,410 --> 00:56:30,402
Rym: That was the first time I ever saw that kind of mode.

690
00:56:31,126 --> 00:56:36,205
Rym: Yeah for me It was the first time I saw I'd never encountered it before and so many other games have been like.

691
00:56:36,285 --> 00:56:40,498
Rym: even overwatch has a gun game That is literally the same gun game you remember from counter-strike.

692
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:46,920
Scott: Yeah, I mean there's a long history of you know counter-strike mods But a lot of them were like stupid level up shit.

693
00:56:47,201 --> 00:56:51,878
Scott: Oh that weird Wow one that like started Pokemon one.

694
00:56:51,918 --> 00:56:52,442
Scott: there's all these.

695
00:56:52,462 --> 00:56:53,370
Scott: there's tons of them.

696
00:56:53,370 --> 00:56:56,890
Scott: They're all weird and zombie ones and all kinds of nonsense.

697
00:56:57,412 --> 00:57:03,986
Scott: But the gun game was also one of those that actually happened to be good because it was really straightforward and made sense.

698
00:57:05,053 --> 00:57:10,210
Scott: And I hope I'm sure they will but they have not yet brought it back which is like that's kind of sad.

699
00:57:10,270 --> 00:57:14,790
Scott: It's like hey, you just made counter-strike 2 and it's less than what counter-strike go was mode wise.

700
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:18,790
Scott: That's you know, so I understand someone being upset about that.

701
00:57:18,850 --> 00:57:20,116
Rym: I guess let us know if you're gonna play it.

702
00:57:20,196 --> 00:57:23,430
Rym: if we have a critical mass of the listener then I don't have that.

703
00:57:23,470 --> 00:57:24,829
Scott: We don't have 10 plus people.

704
00:57:26,214 --> 00:57:28,290
Rym: If we can get enough people we can make a close.

705
00:57:28,391 --> 00:57:34,950
Scott: Yeah, there's people who will nominally say like yes I will I want to but then when it's actually time there won't be 10 people there.

706
00:57:34,990 --> 00:57:36,538
Rym: Yeah, we'll just play it play casually.

707
00:57:36,699 --> 00:57:38,810
Scott: occasionally people will have bad internet.

708
00:57:38,991 --> 00:57:41,962
Rym: I do occasionally pull a listener or two into my overwatch matches.

709
00:57:42,665 --> 00:57:43,347
Scott: Yeah, one or two.

710
00:57:43,367 --> 00:57:44,010
Scott: Yeah for sure.

711
00:57:44,030 --> 00:57:44,767
Scott: Yeah, get that easily.

712
00:57:45,111 --> 00:57:50,630
Rym: But but if we get enough all at least we're not a little making group and if it never gets used it never gets used.

713
00:57:51,246 --> 00:57:59,470
Scott: Yeah We're not like those twitch streamers where like they have a big enough audience on their discord server that they can just make a game At any moment and fill it with people, right?

714
00:57:59,972 --> 00:58:06,116
Rym: We also don't put in that much effort into scheduling games because we're busy Yeah in our 40s.

715
00:58:06,517 --> 00:58:09,749
Scott: I don't that would require scheduling when I play counter-strike.

716
00:58:09,789 --> 00:58:13,304
Scott: Yeah If I even play it, it's not like RIT.

717
00:58:13,344 --> 00:58:15,296
Rym: where I come home from class I would play counter-strike.

718
00:58:15,336 --> 00:58:17,146
Rym: Scott would come home and just join the counter-strike server.

719
00:58:17,187 --> 00:58:21,025
Scott: I was in Yep, but counter-strike do is a thing now.

720
00:58:21,287 --> 00:58:21,789
Scott: Here it is.

721
00:58:22,452 --> 00:58:26,130
Rym: I'm gonna split my time equally between this and overwatch for the foreseeable minor.

722
00:58:26,391 --> 00:58:36,569
Scott: at least my head is off to them for keeping something alive for 23 years and Maintaining the essence and not being a traitor to the thing it is, right?

723
00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:40,165
Scott: They didn't like, you know, it's not like one of those remakes like.

724
00:58:40,205 --> 00:58:41,110
Scott: it's bad now.

725
00:58:41,270 --> 00:58:50,350
Scott: they didn't you know, it's they kept that same thing alive and Updated only the parts that were appropriate to update with the times and the technologies.

726
00:58:50,571 --> 00:59:05,649
Rym: I also looked and it looks like you and I started playing counter-strike when beta 2 came out At the latest because beta 3 appears to be when the p90 was added and I remember the p90 being added and ever being Mad about it strike.

727
00:59:06,754 --> 00:59:11,470
Scott: I guess whatever version was out in like September October of the year 2000.

728
00:59:11,470 --> 00:59:16,830
Rym: Yeah, because November of 2000 is when the first non beta release happens.

729
00:59:18,212 --> 00:59:22,651
Scott: So I played before then whatever was out in September October of the year 2000.

730
00:59:22,651 --> 00:59:23,975
Scott: That was the first counter-strike I played.

731
00:59:24,035 --> 00:59:26,381
Rym: so we played in the early early betas.

732
00:59:26,401 --> 00:59:29,490
