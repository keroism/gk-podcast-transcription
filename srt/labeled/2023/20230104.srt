1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,760
Rym: It's Wednesday, January 4th, 2023.

2
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,041
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,692 --> 00:00:15,130
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,695
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:16,735 --> 00:00:20,270
Rym: Tonight, we are talking about Keanu Reeves, Berserker.

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,128
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:29,510
Rym: It will, it won't hit you like a truck, but, uh, I don't know, it's basically just Keanu Reeves as Wolverine.

8
00:00:31,936 --> 00:00:33,070
Scott: Just jumping out a little bit on the review.

9
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,168
Scott: He's a little more than Wolverine.

10
00:00:34,672 --> 00:00:42,447
Rym: He's a little more than Wolverine, but there's big Wolverine vibes, and I just read an interview right before the show where someone was like, "So, your character's a lot like

11
00:00:42,467 --> 00:00:42,950
Rym: Wolverine.".

12
00:00:43,151 --> 00:00:45,762
Rym: And Keanu Reeves' response is like, "Yeah, I fucking love Wolverine.

13
00:00:45,782 --> 00:00:46,887
Rym: I wanted to play Wolverine.

14
00:00:46,907 --> 00:00:47,268
Rym: Wolverine's

15
00:00:47,389 --> 00:00:47,610
Rym: awesome.".

16
00:00:49,534 --> 00:00:50,363
Rym: Which, yeah, I like it.

17
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:54,308
Scott: I don't think he, I mean, I guess he could kind of do Wolverine, but...

18
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:58,246
Rym: Yeah, well, the interviewer was very much like, "Oh, you would be a great

19
00:00:58,287 --> 00:00:58,829
Rym: Wolverine.".

20
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,310
Rym: Depends on what kind of Wolverine you were going for.

21
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:05,206
Scott: You don't tell anyone anything negative when you're interviewing them, but, you know, you're trying to be good with famous people.

22
00:01:05,226 --> 00:01:05,709
Scott: That's right.

23
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:17,688
Rym: [laughs] You only say bad things to a famous person if you're trying to provoke a reaction from them, or you're about to drop the bomb of, like, "Let's talk about the scandal that you don't know

24
00:01:17,748 --> 00:01:17,989
Rym: about.".

25
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:20,208
Rym: [laughs] Anyway...

26
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,347
Scott: You don't actually ask that to the person to their face.

27
00:01:22,427 --> 00:01:22,690
Scott: Come on.

28
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:23,133
Rym: Depends.

29
00:01:23,194 --> 00:01:24,770
Rym: It depends on the exact situation.

30
00:01:25,594 --> 00:01:30,490
Rym: [laughs] But, uh, anyway, so, uh, you know, it's Wednesday, not Tuesday.

31
00:01:30,631 --> 00:01:46,681
Rym: Not gonna dwell on hockey too much, but, uh, there was a, the hockey game last night between the Rangers and the Carolina Hurricane was actually, like, that was a fucking great hockey game other than a really weird call at the end that I understand now, but it kind of gave the Rangers the game

32
00:01:46,702 --> 00:01:48,287
Scott: in... Yeah, pretty much.

33
00:01:48,551 --> 00:01:49,303
Rym: And I have seen...

34
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:53,870
Scott: I mean, they were already ahead, but it sort of, it was like a, it was like a free-sealed deal.

35
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,227
Scott: It's like, you're up by one, and they just give you one more so they can't win.

36
00:01:58,267 --> 00:01:58,970
Scott: They can't catch up.

37
00:01:59,110 --> 00:01:59,331
Scott: Yep.

38
00:02:00,054 --> 00:02:10,789
Rym: But it's, on one hand, I gotta preface this, because as a Rangers fan, it always feels like the Rangers, like, are usually on the wrong side of iffy calls, but...

39
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:16,704
Scott: It does, it does feel like that, yet so many Rangers fans... I don't do this, right?

40
00:02:16,724 --> 00:02:17,350
Scott: I call it out.

41
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,148
Scott: But so many Rangers fans are always saying, "Ah, the league has it in for the

42
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:21,550
Scott: Rangers.".

43
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,590
Rym: But no, the league does not have it in for the Rangers.

44
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:24,091
Scott: Right?

45
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:25,447
Scott: And I'm like, "What the hell is wrong with

46
00:02:25,487 --> 00:02:25,589
Scott: you?".

47
00:02:25,891 --> 00:02:28,130
Scott: If anything, the league wants the Rangers to win.

48
00:02:28,571 --> 00:02:31,650
Scott: One of the biggest, most expensive teams with the most fans.

49
00:02:31,911 --> 00:02:34,529
Scott: It's like, the league wants the Rangers to win real bad.

50
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:41,770
Rym: They make a lot more money overall if the Rangers win the Stanley Cup than if, like, Buffalo wins it.

51
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:48,507
Scott: Yeah, pretty much, like, if the league had their way, it would be all New York-Toronto all the time to make the biggest one, right?

52
00:02:48,547 --> 00:02:48,989
Scott: They wouldn't...

53
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,779
Rym: There's a way to do a hockey league.

54
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:59,732
Rym: You have a league that's, forget original six, original two, it's just two teams, it's the best players, and it's just this, like, 50/50, like, nonsense game.

55
00:03:00,194 --> 00:03:02,263
Scott: All-star game, but actually that's the only...

56
00:03:02,303 --> 00:03:04,892
Rym: All-star game, but that's it, and like, every player...

57
00:03:05,113 --> 00:03:12,537
Scott: You could just make a league that only has two teams, and they play seven games a year, and that's it.

58
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:13,961
Scott: The end.

59
00:03:14,322 --> 00:03:16,308
Scott: You know, I would... Up to seven games a year.

60
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:22,859
Rym: I would watch that, but also that would be an okay way, if you got an esport that's, like, not big enough to have a real ecosystem.

61
00:03:23,481 --> 00:03:28,442
Rym: That's the kind of league you make to get some buzz without, like, having to make a full league with a bunch of teams.

62
00:03:29,165 --> 00:03:32,880
Scott: I mean, you think about it sort of the way the individual sports work.

63
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:33,522
Scott: It's like tennis.

64
00:03:33,543 --> 00:03:37,901
Scott: There's four tennises a year that really matter, and the rest are lower tennises.

65
00:03:37,921 --> 00:03:39,890
Rym: That's true, and, like, the tennis nerds pay attention.

66
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:45,237
Scott: It's like, yeah, there's a lot of people, but it's still tournaments with, you know, individual champions, and that's, you know...

67
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:55,560
Rym: Yep, but basically there's this play at the end of the game where the ranger... So, one of the members of the Carolina Hurricanes was holding a hockey stick, and the stick just broke, which happened.

68
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,143
Rym: Well, someone...

69
00:03:56,304 --> 00:03:59,218
Scott: It was against the boards, and someone banged into it, and yeah, it broke.

70
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,183
Rym: But they break.

71
00:04:00,263 --> 00:04:02,553
Rym: Like, these are extremely dangerous, powerful people.

72
00:04:02,593 --> 00:04:07,014
Rym: The kind of person where if they, like, if one of them punched me or Scott, we would just die, probably.

73
00:04:07,195 --> 00:04:08,480
Scott: Hockey sticks break often.

74
00:04:09,102 --> 00:04:09,363
Rym: Yep.

75
00:04:09,804 --> 00:04:14,382
Rym: Like, I broke hockey sticks when I was a kid, like, especially, but these are, like, special hockey sticks.

76
00:04:14,423 --> 00:04:18,399
Rym: Anyway, the rule in hockey is you can't play with a broken stick.

77
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:25,582
Rym: So, if you play with a broken stick, because that is extremely dangerous, a broken hockey stick is basically a super sharp spear.

78
00:04:26,585 --> 00:04:26,785
Scott: Yep.

79
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:33,692
Rym: So, the rule is if your stick breaks, you have to drop it immediately, and it is a penalty if you play at all with it.

80
00:04:34,113 --> 00:04:38,427
Scott: So, but in my entire life of watching hockey, that's been the rule, right?

81
00:04:38,548 --> 00:04:46,902
Scott: And just about any hockey game you watch, you're gonna see at least once, if not more than once, hockey stick broken and someone throwing it away, right?

82
00:04:47,123 --> 00:04:50,276
Scott: Immediately, like a hot potato, like, get that shit away from me, right?

83
00:04:50,296 --> 00:04:53,511
Scott: Because you don't want a penalty, and you don't want to hurt someone also, right?

84
00:04:53,591 --> 00:04:53,812
Scott: Both.

85
00:04:54,194 --> 00:05:02,727
Scott: So, and that's every single time in my entire life of all the hockey I've watched at every level, there's been many, many, many broken sticks in every single time.

86
00:05:02,787 --> 00:05:08,411
Scott: So, it immediately throws the stick away, and I've never seen the penalty called because it never needed to be called.

87
00:05:08,552 --> 00:05:08,813
Scott: Yep.

88
00:05:08,893 --> 00:05:12,225
Scott: Nobody ever actually tried to play with the broken stick.

89
00:05:12,265 --> 00:05:16,780
Rym: The average NHL player will go through about 200 sticks a season.

90
00:05:17,162 --> 00:05:23,748
Scott: But that's not that they break 200 sticks, it's that sticks wear out, or they just change a stick every game, or whatever, right?

91
00:05:23,768 --> 00:05:28,550
Scott: And that's 80 something games, so that's like two sticks a game, two to three sticks a game, no big deal.

92
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:28,870
Scott: Yep.

93
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:39,643
Rym: So, in this situation, the penalty got called, and it's a situation where by the letter of the rules of hockey, that was the right call,

94
00:05:40,305 --> 00:05:49,870
Scott: but simultaneously- The guy didn't realize the stick was broken for like about a second, maybe one second at most, but longer than usual, right?

95
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:50,412
Scott: In terms of-.

96
00:05:50,432 --> 00:06:03,750
Rym: But that would have been fine, because it turns out the rule is, if you are holding a broken stick, and the stick itself affects the play in any way, that is the penalty.

97
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:07,599
Rym: So, whether or not you know it's broken does not matter.

98
00:06:09,263 --> 00:06:19,361
Rym: So, in the end, I mean, I feel like the game is broken anyway, but it felt good, even though I'm sure my perception that luck goes against the Rangers more often than for them is wrong.

99
00:06:19,683 --> 00:06:27,997
Rym: I'm sure that every hockey fan on earth believes that about their team, but you know what, I'll take it when luck goes our way, because how many pucks not stop that fucking-.

100
00:06:28,037 --> 00:06:34,787
Scott: I mean, I would be super mad if that call was made against my team, I would be super mad if a Carolina fan said that was a bullshit call.

101
00:06:34,807 --> 00:06:36,453
Scott: I'd say, "Yes, you're right, but I'll take

102
00:06:36,473 --> 00:06:36,513
Scott: it.".

103
00:06:36,674 --> 00:06:36,834
Scott: Yep.

104
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:38,460
Rym: I feel like I'll take.

105
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,929
Rym: it is a very hockey response, not other sports.

106
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,681
Scott: Unlike earlier in the season, right, when Makar got a tripping penalty.

107
00:06:45,721 --> 00:06:54,471
Scott: He drew a tripping penalty, but he fell on his own, and he told the ref, "No, no, no, don't call the penalty,".

108
00:06:54,491 --> 00:06:55,133
Scott: and the ref didn't.

109
00:06:57,138 --> 00:06:58,462
Scott: And it's like, "I wouldn't do that.

110
00:06:58,542 --> 00:07:00,026
Scott: If it was just a whatever game-".

111
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,277
Rym: No, that is too honorable.

112
00:07:03,377 --> 00:07:14,899
Scott: That is like a Klingon letting another Klingon just kill them because of Yeah, it's like if it's just a whatever game, you know, yeah, I would do that sportsman-like behavior of saying, "No, no, no, don't call that penalty,".

113
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:21,804
Scott: but this is a professional game where winning matters, and it's like, "Yeah, the ref was wrong.

114
00:07:21,864 --> 00:07:28,488
Scott: I'll admit the ref was wrong if someone asked me, but I would never try to not win when it's an important for serious

115
00:07:28,528 --> 00:07:28,769
Scott: game.".

116
00:07:28,809 --> 00:07:34,737
Rym: I mean, what's the game we watch where the dude reaches into the goalie's mitt, pulls the puck out, and throws it into the net?

117
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,966
Scott: And then pretends like it was a goal, right?

118
00:07:37,086 --> 00:07:41,865
Scott: It's like he didn't get away with it, but I would absolutely can't blame him for trying.

119
00:07:41,905 --> 00:07:51,561
Rym: I screencapped the screen on the HDPC because there's this moment where like the ref is talking to him, and he's like kind of laughing, and the ref just has this look on his face like, "Are you

120
00:07:51,642 --> 00:07:52,124
Rym: serious?".

121
00:07:52,727 --> 00:07:58,801
Scott: You're gonna waste every tens of this to maybe 20,000 people in just here and all the people at home watching.

122
00:07:58,821 --> 00:08:06,749
Scott: You're going to take away this goal when you just threw the puck in the net with your hand.

123
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:13,434
Rym: So anyway, in the news, this is too big a deal to not talk about, but I'm not going to dwell on it because it's Wednesday.

124
00:08:13,454 --> 00:08:16,910
Rym: We're going to talk about comics, but something just happened in the U.S.

125
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:20,101
Rym: House of Representatives that has not happened in a hundred years.

126
00:08:21,266 --> 00:08:23,112
Scott: It's happened more than once before, though.

127
00:08:23,152 --> 00:08:26,181
Rym: No, so it has happened 14 times.

128
00:08:26,522 --> 00:08:27,766
Scott: Oh, that's more than I thought.

129
00:08:27,866 --> 00:08:41,258
Rym: It has happened 14 times in American history, and the last time it happened was in the year 1923, and in 1923 it was kind of a like ridiculous circumstance.

130
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,995
Rym: Every single other time that it happened was in the lead-up to the Civil War.

131
00:08:46,557 --> 00:08:49,570
Rym: Like, it was sort of a sign that the Civil War was about to happen.

132
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,415
Rym: Like, for real.

133
00:08:51,716 --> 00:08:57,574
Rym: Every single time it happened, other than 1923, was in the lead-up to the Civil War and was about slavery.

134
00:08:58,979 --> 00:09:01,707
Rym: So it stopped happening after the Civil War.

135
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:07,444
Rym: It happened once in 1923 with some weird fucked up nonsense, and now it just happened.

136
00:09:07,604 --> 00:09:10,793
Rym: And as of today, they voted six times and failed.

137
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,641
Rym: There is no Speaker of the House in the United States.

138
00:09:14,464 --> 00:09:22,770
Rym: And the short summary of this, because this is like arcane rules that even American politicians don't super know.

139
00:09:23,192 --> 00:09:26,971
Rym: Like that football game where like there was a tie and like not everyone really knew how ties worked.

140
00:09:27,292 --> 00:09:33,592
Rym: It's kind of like that, but for once, for you non-USians, the rule is actually like so simple.

141
00:09:33,954 --> 00:09:35,078
Rym: it's almost ludicrous.

142
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,087
Scott: It's one sentence in the Constitution.

143
00:09:37,127 --> 00:09:38,814
Scott: Yeah, it's literally the actual Constitution.

144
00:09:38,874 --> 00:09:40,742
Scott: It's not even like some other obscure law.

145
00:09:40,802 --> 00:09:43,133
Scott: It's literally one sentence in the Constitution.

146
00:09:43,193 --> 00:09:45,605
Rym: There's no like regal room for interpretation.

147
00:09:45,646 --> 00:09:46,490
Rym: It's really straightforward.

148
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:55,872
Rym: Every time there's a new Congress, which is every time we have a vote for the House of Representatives, the first thing they do is they bring in all the new members like, "Hey, you're all here.

149
00:09:55,972 --> 00:09:57,538
Rym: We formed our new house.

150
00:09:57,558 --> 00:09:58,241
Rym: We're starting a new

151
00:09:58,261 --> 00:09:58,643
Rym: Congress.".

152
00:09:58,924 --> 00:10:03,199
Rym: The next thing they do is the whole house just votes on who the Speaker of the House is.

153
00:10:04,122 --> 00:10:08,582
Rym: The thing is, political parties don't exist as far as the American Constitution is concerned.

154
00:10:08,603 --> 00:10:09,809
Rym: They're just a thing that people do.

155
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:11,717
Rym: There's no rules about them.

156
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,405
Rym: Like they don't exist in our government.

157
00:10:13,425 --> 00:10:14,691
Scott: You can vote for whoever you wanted.

158
00:10:14,812 --> 00:10:17,163
Scott: At least you can vote for someone who's in the room, right?

159
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:17,484
Rym: Yeah.

160
00:10:17,926 --> 00:10:18,630
Scott: You can't vote for me.

161
00:10:18,811 --> 00:10:19,775
Rym: Actually, you can.

162
00:10:19,795 --> 00:10:20,759
Rym: They don't need to be in the room.

163
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,628
Rym: There's a lot of nonsense.

164
00:10:22,648 --> 00:10:23,090
Scott: Wait, hold on.

165
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:23,773
Scott: I didn't know that.

166
00:10:23,793 --> 00:10:25,099
Scott: That's new information here.

167
00:10:25,119 --> 00:10:26,064
Scott: Yeah, it can be anyone.

168
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:29,077
Scott: Let's say that everyone in the House voted for me.

169
00:10:29,097 --> 00:10:30,785
Scott: You're the Speaker of the House.

170
00:10:30,965 --> 00:10:31,367
Scott: You can resign.

171
00:10:31,488 --> 00:10:35,960
Scott: Okay, that means obviously I'm in line to be President, right?

172
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:36,903
Rym: If you're eligible.

173
00:10:37,164 --> 00:10:39,773
Scott: But sure, I guess I'm not eligible to be President.

174
00:10:39,974 --> 00:10:40,255
Scott: Am I?

175
00:10:40,295 --> 00:10:40,777
Rym: No, you are.

176
00:10:40,797 --> 00:10:41,720
Rym: Okay.

177
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,724
Rym: You absolutely are.

178
00:10:42,805 --> 00:10:44,651
Rym: Unless you were not born on U.S.

179
00:10:44,692 --> 00:10:45,113
Rym: soil.

180
00:10:45,594 --> 00:10:47,260
Scott: Well, that's the age qualification.

181
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,346
Rym: Yeah, you're definitely qualified.

182
00:10:49,366 --> 00:10:57,984
Scott: Okay, anyway, the point is if I became Speaker of the House, but then I would conduct the business of the House and do all the Speaker's roles and have the Speaker's office.

183
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:00,236
Rym: Which basically would mean you have unlimited power to decide.

184
00:11:00,296 --> 00:11:02,949
Scott: I could be the boss of the guy with the mace over there, right?

185
00:11:02,989 --> 00:11:06,539
Rym: You have basically unlimited power to decide what the House does.

186
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:19,646
Scott: Sure, but when it came time to vote on a bill on whether it would become law or at least send it to the Senate to maybe become law, I would not have a vote because I would not be an elected representative from a state.

187
00:11:19,907 --> 00:11:23,249
Rym: But you could do things like the House tries to pass a bill and you're just like, "No, you don't want...".

188
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:26,503
Scott: I mean, I could do things much more powerful than voting, but I wouldn't have a vote.

189
00:11:26,684 --> 00:11:27,166
Rym: Exactly.

190
00:11:27,508 --> 00:11:34,831
Scott: So, okay, the fact that anyone can... Has anyone who is not a House representative been elected Speaker of the House ever?

191
00:11:35,554 --> 00:11:41,854
Rym: It's either happened zero or one times, and if it happened, the one time it happened was like 1700s.

192
00:11:42,757 --> 00:11:49,823
Scott: Could they vote for someone who was like... Could they vote for the person who's already the President making themselves in line for their own job?

193
00:11:50,305 --> 00:12:00,014
Rym: I don't think there's a rule against that, but I'm pretty sure there are rules against the situation that causes... But I don't actually know.

194
00:12:00,034 --> 00:12:03,667
Scott: Could they vote for a Senator to have that job?

195
00:12:03,687 --> 00:12:06,478
Rym: I don't... Well, I think, again, they could vote for anyone.

196
00:12:06,499 --> 00:12:07,222
Rym: The problem...

197
00:12:07,262 --> 00:12:09,974
Scott: Could they vote for the Governor of a state to have that job?

198
00:12:10,035 --> 00:12:12,504
Scott: So someone would be Governor of a state and also...

199
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:18,247
Rym: I am pretty confident, based on everything I've read, they could vote for anyone.

200
00:12:18,267 --> 00:12:24,132
Rym: They could even vote for someone who is not a citizen and who is not able to be President because they weren't born on US soil.

201
00:12:24,514 --> 00:12:26,424
Rym: All that means is they get skipped in the line of succession.

202
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:28,354
Scott: But anyway, they can't agree on anyone right now.

203
00:12:28,454 --> 00:12:39,489
Rym: So basically, because the vote is the entire House, and our fascist party only holds the House by a few seats, if any four Republicans don't vote for...

204
00:12:39,549 --> 00:12:39,870
Scott: No, three.

205
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:40,531
Scott: Three.

206
00:12:40,691 --> 00:12:40,912
Rym: Four.

207
00:12:42,055 --> 00:12:53,030
Scott: They have a lead of four seats, so if three people vote otherwise... Yeah, so they... I guess three means they're voting for the Democrat.

208
00:12:53,491 --> 00:13:04,147
Rym: Yeah, so basically, every time we vote, there are 212 votes for a Democrat, because that is actually the person who keeps winning these votes, but you need a majority to become Speaker.

209
00:13:04,588 --> 00:13:08,121
Rym: So the Democrats all vote for a really good person, Akeem Jeffries.

210
00:13:08,141 --> 00:13:16,810
Rym: 200-ish Republicans vote for an absolute dipshit guy, and then like 20 Republicans vote for an even fashier dipshit.

211
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:19,719
Scott: It's the even fashier dipshit.

212
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:21,988
Scott: It's like, "How much worse can you

213
00:13:22,008 --> 00:13:22,209
Scott: get?".

214
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:29,953
Rym: But the reason this is happening is that the 20-ish people who are basically saying, "Nope, we're not going to let it

215
00:13:29,973 --> 00:13:30,275
Rym: happen."

216
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:39,175
Rym: They're the kinds of people who do not care what happens to Congress at all, and they were elected by people who don't believe the 2020 election was fair and who are just crazy.

217
00:13:39,636 --> 00:13:49,650
Rym: So their base loves this, meaning they'll get re-elected into the House forever, and they benefit from the Republicans and the Democrats failing to do anything.

218
00:13:49,931 --> 00:13:55,052
Rym: So they're basically holding the Republican Party hostage, and they're holding America hostage, because guess what?

219
00:13:55,353 --> 00:13:58,705
Rym: Until the House has a Speaker, the House cannot do anything.

220
00:13:59,026 --> 00:14:00,973
Rym: It can't even pay its members.

221
00:14:01,254 --> 00:14:02,317
Rym: It can't hire aides.

222
00:14:02,598 --> 00:14:03,581
Rym: It can't hire staff.

223
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:04,805
Rym: It can't process payroll.

224
00:14:05,106 --> 00:14:07,754
Rym: It can do nothing, and the rule is...

225
00:14:07,774 --> 00:14:12,228
Scott: Well, they could theoretically still pass a law.

226
00:14:12,288 --> 00:14:12,810
Rym: No, they can't.

227
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:16,297
Scott: It doesn't say that in the Constitution.

228
00:14:16,337 --> 00:14:18,667
Scott: It still says they could get a majority.

229
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:19,992
Scott: They could vote for a law.

230
00:14:20,133 --> 00:14:23,122
Rym: The House needs a Speaker to bring the bill to the floor.

231
00:14:23,784 --> 00:14:27,766
Scott: I thought that's a rule that they would have to elect a Speaker and pass rules to make that a rule every time.

232
00:14:27,786 --> 00:14:30,397
Rym: The House needs to elect a Speaker to have a rule.

233
00:14:31,701 --> 00:14:38,290
Scott: Right, but you don't need to have a rule of making a law is in the Constitution, so that's the one rule you don't need to vote into being a rule.

234
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:47,720
Rym: The Speaker... So there are extremely arcane things that could happen, but effectively, the way this works is now playoff hockey overtime rules.

235
00:14:48,061 --> 00:14:53,806
Rym: They just keep voting, and the dipshit caucus, which actually a few reporters are even calling them now.

236
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:57,263
Rym: on the Republican side, they basically said, "Nothing will convince us.

237
00:14:57,504 --> 00:14:59,373
Rym: We're going to vote against this guy forever.

238
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:00,417
Rym: We will not

239
00:15:00,438 --> 00:15:00,960
Rym: negotiate.".

240
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:01,381
Scott: Good.

241
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:02,446
Scott: Do nothing for two years.

242
00:15:02,486 --> 00:15:03,169
Scott: That would be amazing.

243
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:08,692
Rym: That would be the best possible outcome compared to the alternative of the fascist party doing anything, literally anything.

244
00:15:09,995 --> 00:15:16,873
Rym: So this is unprecedented territory that we have not been in since before the Civil War.

245
00:15:16,893 --> 00:15:23,755
Rym: It is worth reading up the details of this because this is ongoing, and it's a shit show.

246
00:15:23,795 --> 00:15:27,305
Rym: This is an absolute clown circus fuck-up.

247
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:28,790
Rym: Nobody expected this.

248
00:15:29,252 --> 00:15:31,240
Rym: I even didn't think this would actually happen.

249
00:15:31,521 --> 00:15:33,168
Rym: Like, this is the kind of thing...

250
00:15:33,188 --> 00:15:34,555
Scott: I just want to put this out there.

251
00:15:34,736 --> 00:15:38,492
Scott: I mean, sure, someone else has already put this out there, but if you know, if we only need...

252
00:15:38,512 --> 00:15:48,688
Rym: Oh, the Democrats are heavily, heavily trying to convince a few Republicans who aren't even going to run for re-election, like they're on their way out.

253
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:51,119
Rym: They're in the current Congress, like not the new one that's coming in.

254
00:15:51,662 --> 00:15:53,891
Rym: Just vote for someone good and then retire.

255
00:15:55,094 --> 00:15:57,120
Scott: That's one way out.

256
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,063
Scott: That's one way out.

257
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,426
Scott: There's another way out, right?

258
00:15:59,928 --> 00:16:05,902
Scott: Go convince three states to recall their Republicans.

259
00:16:05,922 --> 00:16:11,419
Scott: Or even better, and if they send Democrats instead, right, then that's enough votes for the Democrats.

260
00:16:11,439 --> 00:16:12,705
Rym: Scott, it's even easier than that.

261
00:16:13,046 --> 00:16:14,855
Rym: The rule is not the majority of the House.

262
00:16:14,935 --> 00:16:16,925
Rym: The rule is the majority of the members present.

263
00:16:17,728 --> 00:16:19,895
Scott: Oh, you just trapped someone outside.

264
00:16:19,915 --> 00:16:20,437
Rym: So guess what?

265
00:16:20,758 --> 00:16:26,059
Rym: If a small number of Republicans don't show up and quorum gets called, Democrats just win.

266
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,766
Scott: How do you call the quorum without the speaker?

267
00:16:28,047 --> 00:16:28,670
Scott: Who's in charge?

268
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:36,296
Rym: So the actual procedure is first, the teller, like the administrative staff, do a vote to see if there is a quorum.

269
00:16:36,859 --> 00:16:39,672
Scott: What if those people aren't present because they're not being paid and they just go home?

270
00:16:39,773 --> 00:16:44,676
Rym: Then there can't be a quorum and we have a constitutional crisis and that has never happened and nobody knows what to do.

271
00:16:46,021 --> 00:16:47,567
Scott: What if Mace Guy is just like, "Fuck this

272
00:16:47,588 --> 00:16:47,788
Scott: shit.".

273
00:16:48,331 --> 00:16:49,838
Rym: I hope Mace Guy just fucking leaves.

274
00:16:51,004 --> 00:16:59,112
Rym: See, it's funny, if this was the UK, you know there'd be like, in the wimbly dimbly of 1840, the Mace something something and by their grace and his pleasure.

275
00:16:59,132 --> 00:17:05,714
Scott: Well, you know, you gotta say a point in favor of the monarchy is that, you know, there is a fallback.

276
00:17:06,297 --> 00:17:14,867
Scott: You have this sort of on-paper autocrat that doesn't actually do anything and just lets the democracy happen, but the democracy really collapses, right?

277
00:17:14,887 --> 00:17:18,863
Scott: It's like, technically, the monarch can be like poke, right?

278
00:17:18,883 --> 00:17:19,705
Rym: You know what I would say?

279
00:17:19,726 --> 00:17:22,596
Rym: This is a total aside, but this is actually a real opinion I have.

280
00:17:23,078 --> 00:17:32,471
Rym: Stopping Brexit would have been like the moment for a monarch to do something and the fact that they chose not to ended even that power of the monarchy.

281
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:34,998
Scott: Yes, well, that particular monarchy, yeah.

282
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:36,121
Rym: Yep.

283
00:17:36,261 --> 00:17:41,716
Scott: I'm not saying I would, I mean, this is a point in favor.

284
00:17:41,937 --> 00:17:43,883
Rym: There are a surprising number of...

285
00:17:43,923 --> 00:17:48,740
Scott: While I have spoken a point in favor of monarchies, I am not in favor of monarchies.

286
00:17:48,781 --> 00:17:51,130
Scott: The con list is much longer than the pro list.

287
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:58,054
Rym: Like, if you list all the pros and cons of heroin, there are some pros, but there are thousands and thousands of cons.

288
00:17:58,395 --> 00:17:59,619
Scott: Yeah, heroin feels great.

289
00:18:00,101 --> 00:18:06,366
Scott: If I just say that and I don't talk about all the cons of heroin, I just don't want someone to think I'm pro-heroine.

290
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:08,758
Rym: We did that panel a long time where we were like, "What's the most fun game on Earth?

291
00:18:08,959 --> 00:18:09,321
Rym: Just take

292
00:18:09,361 --> 00:18:09,764
Rym: heroin.".

293
00:18:10,307 --> 00:18:11,352
Rym: Doesn't mean you should play it.

294
00:18:11,573 --> 00:18:13,099
Scott: There might be better games than that.

295
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,405
Rym: Yeah, I'm mega-heroine.

296
00:18:14,706 --> 00:18:16,893
Scott: I haven't tried any of those, that whole genre, on purpose.

297
00:18:16,913 --> 00:18:18,156
Scott: Yeah, that and MMOs, never once.

298
00:18:18,176 --> 00:18:19,699
Rym: Anyway.

299
00:18:19,719 --> 00:18:21,222
Rym: I played some months.

300
00:18:25,392 --> 00:18:27,681
Rym: It's some animation news, because I don't dwell on that.

301
00:18:27,741 --> 00:18:33,141
Rym: You can read an article that'll be way more informed than I am about the arcane procedures of the American house.

302
00:18:33,663 --> 00:18:38,599
Rym: MF Ghost, the anime that's just more Initial D. We have our third trailer.

303
00:18:39,061 --> 00:18:40,124
Rym: It has Eurobeat in it.

304
00:18:40,425 --> 00:18:43,695
Rym: This is the trailer that actually has Eurobeat in it.

305
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:46,323
Rym: This is the final actual confirmation.

306
00:18:46,343 --> 00:18:48,390
Rym: Initial D2 has Eurobeat.

307
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:49,696
Rym: That is all I needed to hear.

308
00:18:49,716 --> 00:18:50,520
Rym: I literally don't care.

309
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:51,828
Scott: I mean, technically, this isn't Initial D2.

310
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:56,266
Scott: They've already had Initial D1, 2, 3, however many Initial D's.

311
00:18:56,286 --> 00:18:59,478
Rym: I watched through, like, Fourth Stage or whatever?

312
00:18:59,498 --> 00:19:01,366
Rym: Anyway, I watched a lot more Initial D than you do.

313
00:19:01,386 --> 00:19:06,608
Scott: This is the point at which, basically, you know, MF Ghost manga, to my knowledge, has been around a while.

314
00:19:06,668 --> 00:19:11,050
Scott: But basically, the same guy who made Initial D is like, "Okay, I can't do anything more with these characters.

315
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,315
Scott: Times have changed, right?

316
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:20,021
Scott: I will just, rather than make more Initial D, I'll just make another car manga with new characters, new cars, new

317
00:19:20,121 --> 00:19:20,383
Scott: everything.".

318
00:19:20,403 --> 00:19:25,123
Rym: So, Scott, I'm gonna name some names of characters who are now confirmed to be in the manga and the show.

319
00:19:25,866 --> 00:19:34,022
Rym: Takahashi Ryosuke, Takahashi Keisuke, Ikitani, Itsuki, Kenji are all in the show.

320
00:19:34,042 --> 00:19:35,125
Rym: Okay.

321
00:19:35,766 --> 00:19:41,650
Rym: It literally is following the dream project that they started in Initial D, so it really is kind of just... Are they this old?

322
00:19:42,152 --> 00:19:42,995
Rym: It is, I guess.

323
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:47,050
Rym: So, yeah, this is gonna be the dumbest show that I watch.

324
00:19:50,913 --> 00:19:51,516
Rym: You got any news?

325
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:54,750
Scott: Yeah, so let's talk about something, you know, good being made.

326
00:19:55,891 --> 00:19:58,159
Rym: Oh my god, I'm so excited about this.

327
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:17,414
Scott: Right, so Cartoon Saloon, who we are big fans of here at GeekNights, the Irish animation studio that brought you the Irish trilogy, as well as many other amazing works, and as well as many other works that we don't really pay attention to, like some kids' TV shows like that, Puffin Rock, or whatever, which I'm sure if I had a child, I would show it to them, but...

328
00:20:17,455 --> 00:20:20,790
Rym: Yeah, one of the rare batting a thousand entities on Earth.

329
00:20:22,412 --> 00:20:25,546
Scott: Yeah, so they're, you know, they gotta make some more movies now, right?

330
00:20:25,566 --> 00:20:28,558
Scott: They finished that Wolf Walkers, they gotta go to the next, right?

331
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:30,285
Scott: It's like, what are they gonna make now?

332
00:20:31,469 --> 00:20:37,573
Scott: You know, it's like, well, wisely, they're not like, "Okay, guy who's directed everything we've made, make something

333
00:20:37,633 --> 00:20:37,934
Scott: again.".

334
00:20:37,954 --> 00:20:43,354
Scott: You know, it's like, let's get some new people in here, we'll animate what they want instead, right?

335
00:20:44,097 --> 00:21:00,041
Scott: So, someone I've never heard of, but has an Oscar nomination named Louise Bagnall, I hope I'm pronouncing their name correctly, they made a short called Late Afternoon, which I think was the Oscar-nominated thing.

336
00:21:00,061 --> 00:21:08,611
Scott: I think they also made, let's see, cartoon development, Oscar-nominated, debut feature, Julian.

337
00:21:09,072 --> 00:21:35,450
Scott: Right, okay, so there's a book called Julian is a Mermaid by Jessica Love, and Louise Bagnall is going to direct the full-length animated feature adaptation of Julian is a Mermaid, but it's only called Julian, and Cartoon Saloon, the same studio that did the Wolf Walkers and the Song of the Sea and all that, is going to be the studio receiving that direction.

338
00:21:37,151 --> 00:21:37,854
Scott: We got it sorted.

339
00:21:38,596 --> 00:21:43,975
Scott: The point is, Julian is a Mermaid is like an awesome story, it's obviously a kid's book, right?

340
00:21:44,457 --> 00:21:49,518
Scott: But it's an awesome story about New York, so it's like, yep, they finished their Ireland, and like, where are we going next?

341
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:50,423
Scott: New York, that's right.

342
00:21:50,443 --> 00:21:51,046
Rym: Yep.

343
00:21:51,388 --> 00:21:51,790
Scott: Let's go.

344
00:21:53,351 --> 00:22:02,771
Rym: Right alongside, we're both reading, or I'll be imminently reading, as I finish and leave the unseen, the world we make, which seems like I'm just gonna burn through that thing pretty quick.

345
00:22:05,018 --> 00:22:08,429
Scott: So yeah, who knows when this is coming out, or how it's coming out, or anything.

346
00:22:08,469 --> 00:22:20,350
Rym: Whenever it comes out, I imagine we will be in the theater seeing it in New York, because you can see any animated movie in New York when it comes out, and I highly encourage you to see this sight unseen.

347
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:23,701
Rym: You don't need a review to know to go see this movie.

348
00:22:24,062 --> 00:22:26,491
Scott: I mean, this is in a super early stage, right?

349
00:22:26,531 --> 00:22:35,896
Scott: It says they're gonna pitch it in March at a French event or whatever, so it's in the pitching phase, I guess.

350
00:22:35,936 --> 00:22:49,627
Scott: They're trying to get some monies and whatnot, but it's like, so far, usually when I see a news about a movie, especially movies, that early, you can't say it's gonna happen, because Mouseguard had people animating it, and it didn't happen, right?

351
00:22:49,647 --> 00:22:56,270
Scott: They filmed whole movies, and they never got released, but Cartoon Salute has never failed to release it.

352
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:59,441
Scott: It's a thing that they have mentioned publicly.

353
00:23:00,124 --> 00:23:06,414
Scott: They've always found a way, so I'm confident that within maybe a few years, we will see this, and that'll be pretty good.

354
00:23:12,038 --> 00:23:14,623
Rym: But anyway, things of the day!

355
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:20,102
Rym: I try not to use, we both try not to use the same channel or the same website like more than once.

356
00:23:21,106 --> 00:23:22,651
Rym: Obviously, you know, a lot of GeekNights.

357
00:23:22,691 --> 00:23:23,193
Rym: We started in 2005.

358
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:36,204
Rym: Otherwise, it'd be easy to just do practical engineering like every fucking week for me, but I realized I've used SciShow and a bunch of other things that John and/or Hank Green have made over the years, so I can't use those channels.

359
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:43,547
Rym: I have never used the Vlogbrothers as a thing of the day, so this video from a year ago that's new to me.

360
00:23:43,567 --> 00:23:45,132
Scott: Is it the vlog?

361
00:23:45,714 --> 00:23:47,720
Rym: Yeah, Vlog or Vlog, Video Log.

362
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,203
Scott: You mean vlog?

363
00:23:50,323 --> 00:23:50,825
Rym: Vlog.

364
00:23:51,848 --> 00:23:52,370
Scott: Vlog?

365
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:55,280
Scott: I mean, I gotta post an article on my Vlog.

366
00:23:57,484 --> 00:23:59,859
Rym: I was thinking it was the guy in that video who calls it his home page.

367
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:08,960
Rym: Anyway, so this video is titled "So Orange Juice Isn't What It Seems" and one, it's really funny.

368
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:13,053
Rym: Like, Hank Green definitely has evolved and extremely...

369
00:24:13,073 --> 00:24:14,378
Scott: Eh, I watched it.

370
00:24:14,438 --> 00:24:15,403
Scott: It's a YouTube yelling guy.

371
00:24:15,423 --> 00:24:16,107
Rym: I don't think it's funny.

372
00:24:16,127 --> 00:24:17,917
Rym: I think Hank Green's style is extremely funny.

373
00:24:17,937 --> 00:24:22,458
Rym: I actually very much like his evolved current, like the style he grew into about five years ago.

374
00:24:22,478 --> 00:24:22,980
Rym: Did not lol.

375
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:23,983
Scott: No lols.

376
00:24:24,003 --> 00:24:24,826
Rym: You don't laugh at anything.

377
00:24:24,846 --> 00:24:27,757
Scott: I laugh at it, it's actually funny.

378
00:24:28,138 --> 00:24:46,720
Rym: But the more important thing is that this video sort of condenses all the things I think about orange juice very succinctly into a video and none of this is new to me or Scott, but if you drink orange juice and you think you know anything about the orange juice you're drinking, you're probably wrong.

379
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:50,213
Rym: And also, orange juice is not better for you than just fucking soda.

380
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,301
Rym: Like, I still drink orange juice.

381
00:24:52,361 --> 00:24:56,515
Rym: I love orange juice, but in the words of Hank Green, it's just candy water.

382
00:24:56,535 --> 00:25:05,912
Scott: Well, the one thing he doesn't mention, which is what I did to basically stop drinking orange juice, which is, you know, he compares, you know, the fresh orange juice, right?

383
00:25:05,952 --> 00:25:07,760
Scott: Get oranges and squeeze them, right?

384
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,192
Scott: Whereas what I just do is I just eat oranges.

385
00:25:11,273 --> 00:25:13,201
Scott: You don't have to squeeze them, just eat the or- Oh, peel.

386
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:16,075
Scott: You don't have to peel, but you take the- Peel it and fucking eat it.

387
00:25:16,196 --> 00:25:19,089
Rym: Yeah, but the problem is that slows you down like a pistachio.

388
00:25:19,129 --> 00:25:21,178
Rym: You got to open each pistachio and eat them.

389
00:25:21,439 --> 00:25:23,287
Scott: Drinking orange juice is like- No, no, no.

390
00:25:23,327 --> 00:25:27,786
Scott: You open a pistachio and you get, like, one little nut and you have to open a bunch of them.

391
00:25:27,827 --> 00:25:31,581
Scott: An orange, you can open one orange and you get a ton of orange.

392
00:25:31,722 --> 00:25:40,329
Rym: But I can drink orange juice and it's like the equivalent of just funneling a bag of pre-shelled pistachios directly into my mouth.

393
00:25:40,931 --> 00:25:41,875
Scott: Yeah, it's a bad idea.

394
00:25:41,895 --> 00:25:42,618
Scott: It's a good idea.

395
00:25:42,638 --> 00:25:43,662
Rym: It's a great idea.

396
00:25:43,763 --> 00:25:44,345
Scott: It's a bad idea.

397
00:25:45,087 --> 00:25:48,017
Scott: I eat like 5000 calories a day in the summer, so.

398
00:25:48,037 --> 00:25:51,349
Scott: At least in North America, it's orange season like now-ish, right?

399
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:54,399
Scott: Go and just buy a sack of oranges.

400
00:25:54,439 --> 00:25:55,765
Scott: That's the cheapest way to get them.

401
00:25:56,046 --> 00:25:58,274
Scott: And just eat oranges every morning.

402
00:25:58,315 --> 00:26:02,110
Scott: And that's- You'll get fiber and everything and there's still delicious juice in there.

403
00:26:02,392 --> 00:26:09,236
Scott: You still experience plenty of juice flavor, but you take in much less candy water into your body.

404
00:26:09,256 --> 00:26:13,536
Rym: Thing is, I'm seeking the candy water because remember, I'm all- I'm pretty much always at a calorie deficit.

405
00:26:13,576 --> 00:26:15,084
Rym: Like, I got to keep eating or I have trouble.

406
00:26:15,165 --> 00:26:15,929
Scott: Eat more oranges.

407
00:26:15,969 --> 00:26:16,652
Scott: Eat the whole sack.

408
00:26:16,954 --> 00:26:19,967
Rym: Yeah, but if I eat the whole sack, I could also juice the whole sack and drink it.

409
00:26:21,152 --> 00:26:23,662
Scott: You're throwing away all that useful delicious fibers.

410
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:26,530
Rym: Nah, but I also- I zest them all for cocktails.

411
00:26:26,972 --> 00:26:27,975
Rym: Anyway, what do you got?

412
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:29,761
Scott: What do I have?

413
00:26:29,801 --> 00:26:32,190
Scott: So, I didn't know this sport existed, which is very rare.

414
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:34,298
Scott: It's underwater hockey.

415
00:26:34,318 --> 00:26:36,287
Scott: Apparently, people in the UK play it.

416
00:26:36,327 --> 00:26:37,796
Scott: I don't know if anyone else anywhere else plays it.

417
00:26:37,856 --> 00:26:39,483
Rym: I kind of want to try to play it.

418
00:26:39,563 --> 00:26:45,601
Scott: I thought this was one of those fake concocted documentary videos, but no, it's real.

419
00:26:47,446 --> 00:26:52,739
Scott: This may be among- first of all, the notable things about this sport, right?

420
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:54,125
Scott: So, it's underwater hockey.

421
00:26:54,426 --> 00:27:03,162
Scott: There's a puck just like a hockey- ice hockey puck and you have a little tiny sticks and the puck is at the bottom of the swimming pool and you're trying to get it into a goal.

422
00:27:03,704 --> 00:27:05,512
Scott: It's- the rules are what you think they are.

423
00:27:05,572 --> 00:27:07,420
Scott: The problem is, it's at the bottom of the pool.

424
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,525
Scott: It's three meters deep.

425
00:27:09,887 --> 00:27:11,251
Scott: Meters, right?

426
00:27:11,452 --> 00:27:13,558
Scott: You can't- you got to dive to get down there.

427
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:15,648
Scott: Everyone's got flippers and goggles and everything.

428
00:27:15,668 --> 00:27:20,646
Rym: Yeah, there's going to be no Shaq situation where someone's so tall they can just kind of kick it or something.

429
00:27:22,371 --> 00:27:26,400
Scott: But, good luck staying down there that long, right?

430
00:27:26,481 --> 00:27:37,208
Scott: It's like even if you're the Wayne Gretzky of swim hockey, pool underwater hockey, like you go down there, you can be amazing, but it's like there's no way you're going to get the puck all the way from one end of the pool to the other.

431
00:27:37,228 --> 00:27:38,374
Scott: It's a full-size pool.

432
00:27:38,535 --> 00:27:44,297
Rym: And even more, the harder you play, the more you use up your oxygen and the less time you can spend down there.

433
00:27:44,317 --> 00:27:51,097
Scott: Yeah, it's like you basically must have like teamwork to be any good at this game.

434
00:27:51,137 --> 00:27:55,472
Scott: You cannot- it's not an individual- it's like the least individual sport ever, right?

435
00:27:55,513 --> 00:28:02,522
Scott: Like your whole- you could have a team- like one person in the video even says you could put all the best players in the same team and they would suck.

436
00:28:02,603 --> 00:28:04,391
Scott: The team that wins all the time is this team.

437
00:28:04,412 --> 00:28:05,778
Scott: that's like been together for 12 years.

438
00:28:06,422 --> 00:28:07,869
Scott: They all know what everyone's going to do.

439
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:09,819
Scott: They've got all their systems worked out, right?

440
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,195
Scott: You know, and they've had very few lineup changes and that team dominates, right?

441
00:28:14,215 --> 00:28:19,539
Scott: Because that's- it's all about- you talk about coordination of like, you know, some FPS team in Overwatch.

442
00:28:19,579 --> 00:28:24,053
Scott: It's like comes nothing close to, you know, the underwater hockey.

443
00:28:24,073 --> 00:28:30,816
Scott: And the second thing is that the underwater hockey may be the most physically demanding sport I've ever seen.

444
00:28:30,836 --> 00:28:37,319
Scott: Like it doesn't look physically demanding like, you know, a weightlifting or a sprinting or a, you know, a gymnastics.

445
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:38,142
Rym: I'll give you an example.

446
00:28:38,303 --> 00:28:42,982
Rym: I can run- I can run a half marathon without even breaking a sweat in under two hours.

447
00:28:43,022 --> 00:28:44,106
Rym: Like I just feel great at the end.

448
00:28:44,688 --> 00:28:49,464
Rym: I can't swim more than like half a mile without being fucking wrecked.

449
00:28:50,126 --> 00:28:51,491
Scott: But it's like just swimming.

450
00:28:51,571 --> 00:28:53,257
Scott: But like, no, this isn't just swimming.

451
00:28:53,297 --> 00:29:00,674
Scott: This is- you're going underwater and holding your breath for a significant amount of time, coming back up and then trying to go back under as soon as possible.

452
00:29:00,734 --> 00:29:05,871
Scott: And when you're down there, swimming with flippers as hard as you can, right?

453
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:10,430
Scott: And it's like, if you're the goalie, it's like the goalie I think is the most fascinating thing.

454
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:14,787
Scott: They didn't talk about it in the video, but I sort of noticed like, do you have a goalie even?

455
00:29:14,988 --> 00:29:16,774
Scott: It's like, why bother, right?

456
00:29:16,834 --> 00:29:20,466
Scott: But the goalie can't just stay down there and wait the whole time.

457
00:29:20,486 --> 00:29:25,565
Scott: The goalie has to stay up and look into the water with their goggles and their snorkel.

458
00:29:25,786 --> 00:29:27,070
Scott: Like they have snorkels, short ones.

459
00:29:28,213 --> 00:29:34,255
Scott: And like, see if the puck is coming close to the goal and when it does, time their dive, right?

460
00:29:34,315 --> 00:29:37,665
Scott: It's like the goalie might go down, make a save, right?

461
00:29:37,926 --> 00:29:41,679
Scott: Run out of breath and be like, "Am I gonna die or are we gonna get scored

462
00:29:41,699 --> 00:29:41,739
Scott: on?".

463
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,260
Rym: Yep, go down too early and you gotta come up and then undefended goal, empty net.

464
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,553
Scott: Yeah, do you have two goalies like rotating?

465
00:29:48,573 --> 00:29:49,437
Scott: Like what are you gonna do?

466
00:29:49,498 --> 00:29:51,423
Scott: It's like, I don't know.

467
00:29:52,004 --> 00:29:54,151
Scott: But yeah, I would never play this.

468
00:29:54,693 --> 00:29:55,656
Scott: I would never watch it.

469
00:29:55,716 --> 00:29:59,229
Rym: If it were easy to play, like I would want to play a game of this.

470
00:29:59,289 --> 00:30:00,596
Rym: This would be really fun, I think.

471
00:30:00,656 --> 00:30:02,645
Scott: Yeah, I would play in a much shallower pool.

472
00:30:02,665 --> 00:30:06,059
Rym: I play in a deep pool, but I would want to play it with people who are...

473
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,325
Scott: Not three meters.

474
00:30:07,426 --> 00:30:08,914
Scott: It had to be like three meters to be fun.

475
00:30:08,994 --> 00:30:13,033
Rym: I just want to, I would play it against people who are as bad at it as I expect I will be.

476
00:30:13,053 --> 00:30:14,680
Rym: I don't want to play against people who are good.

477
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:20,706
Scott: The problem with the three meter pool is that like I would have a hard time even getting to the bottom period.

478
00:30:20,726 --> 00:30:21,712
Rym: Blow on flippers.

479
00:30:21,752 --> 00:30:22,215
Rym: make that real.

480
00:30:22,235 --> 00:30:23,622
Rym: Have you ever swum with... They help, they help.

481
00:30:23,662 --> 00:30:25,228
Rym: Have you ever swum with flippers?

482
00:30:25,348 --> 00:30:27,256
Rym: It is like quadruple speed.

483
00:30:27,336 --> 00:30:28,400
Rym: Like it is, it's hacks.

484
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:33,121
Scott: But also I could only stay down, you know, the amount of time it would take me to get to the bottom.

485
00:30:33,162 --> 00:30:35,010
Scott: I'd be able to hockey for like a few seconds.

486
00:30:35,271 --> 00:30:38,366
Scott: It's like, give me the one and a half meter, two meter pool.

487
00:30:38,386 --> 00:30:40,134
Scott: Then I can actually do some hockey.

488
00:30:40,215 --> 00:30:41,240
Rym: How long can you hold your breath?

489
00:30:41,541 --> 00:30:42,123
Rym: I'm curious.

490
00:30:42,143 --> 00:30:47,264
Scott: I mean, the problem is I could, you know, okay, so I do a little bit of hockeying and then I come up.

491
00:30:47,626 --> 00:30:50,318
Scott: It's like, how long until I can go down again?

492
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:53,288
Scott: It's like, my time at the bottom is decreasing.

493
00:30:53,328 --> 00:30:53,930
Scott: That's true.

494
00:30:53,950 --> 00:31:01,075
Rym: Because you can train yourself with hypoxic training to be able to work harder with less air.

495
00:31:01,215 --> 00:31:03,163
Scott: Well, doesn't that significantly shorten your life?

496
00:31:03,966 --> 00:31:05,091
Rym: No, there's no evidence of that.

497
00:31:05,151 --> 00:31:05,232
Rym: In

498
00:31:05,272 --> 00:31:08,643
Scott: fact, people who dive for, you know, clams and so

499
00:31:08,703 --> 00:31:21,585
Rym: people who do extreme diving like that, it probably is not great for their brains, but people, if you don't do that kind of stuff, you can train yourself to hold your breath, like double the time a normal person could without any significant injury, according to my physical therapist.

500
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:26,666
Rym: Anyway, I'm not messing with that, but anyway, in the meta moment, the geek does book club book.

501
00:31:26,686 --> 00:31:27,650
Rym: I leave the unseen.

502
00:31:28,032 --> 00:31:30,905
Rym: I'm going to be out of town next week for a work trip in Germany.

503
00:31:31,367 --> 00:31:40,427
Rym: So we'll either do the show the following week, which would be an off day because that's another Monday, Wednesday week, or, uh, right after I get back from a separate unrelated ski trip in Vail.

504
00:31:40,507 --> 00:31:46,972
Rym: So finish, I'll leave the unseen in January because we're going to do an episode at the latest in the first part of February.

505
00:31:46,992 --> 00:31:48,055
Rym: All right.

506
00:31:48,557 --> 00:31:49,400
Scott: Uh, we have a forum.

507
00:31:49,561 --> 00:31:57,129
Scott: We've talked about it on every episode of this show ever, basically, but, uh, I just upgraded the forum, which I do whenever there's up upgrades.

508
00:31:58,092 --> 00:32:00,700
Scott: But today there was a somewhat bigger upgrade.

509
00:32:01,663 --> 00:32:08,062
Scott: Uh, and so I went through all the settings on the forum and I rejiggered them all, not too much, but enough.

510
00:32:09,006 --> 00:32:13,605
Scott: Uh, and now the forum is as a nude, it's got a little sidebar going on, which I think is much nicer.

511
00:32:13,645 --> 00:32:15,031
Rym: I like that little sidebar.

512
00:32:15,452 --> 00:32:16,316
Scott: Yeah.

513
00:32:16,336 --> 00:32:16,979
Scott: So I'm like, all right.

514
00:32:16,999 --> 00:32:18,324
Scott: I don't know if anyone's mad about that.

515
00:32:18,364 --> 00:32:20,150
Scott: They can go kick rocks.

516
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:26,918
Rym: If Twitter's got you down and you don't know how the fuck Mastodon works, because good luck actually knowing every detail.

517
00:32:26,938 --> 00:32:28,987
Scott: Mastodon is not hard to describe how it works.

518
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:29,890
Scott: It's just email.

519
00:32:30,011 --> 00:32:30,252
Rym: Yes.

520
00:32:30,292 --> 00:32:31,396
Scott: The same thing as email.

521
00:32:31,758 --> 00:32:33,524
Scott: I have found understand how email works.

522
00:32:34,167 --> 00:32:40,591
Rym: I have found that most of the people are saying Mastodon is complicated are just not like getting that basic concept.

523
00:32:40,612 --> 00:32:42,460
Scott: You understand email, you understand Mastodon.

524
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:43,200
Scott: Yup.

525
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:43,601
Rym: Same thing.

526
00:32:43,702 --> 00:32:47,812
Rym: Federated timeline is harder for people.

527
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:50,760
Scott: Mastodon does, but it's not necessary.

528
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,121
Scott: It's not.

529
00:32:51,201 --> 00:33:00,499
Rym: part of what I don't understand is people are really, really butthurt about that tab, but you don't even have to look at that tab and not all the Mastodon does even have that tab.

530
00:33:01,782 --> 00:33:07,665
Scott: There's a difference between the protocol that Mastodon uses and the Mastodon software and the decisions it made.

531
00:33:07,725 --> 00:33:07,885
Scott: Right.

532
00:33:07,925 --> 00:33:10,254
Scott: Imagine if you had email, right.

533
00:33:10,374 --> 00:33:13,365
Scott: And you chose Gmail as your, your email provider.

534
00:33:14,027 --> 00:33:26,014
Scott: And there was a tab in Gmail that showed you like other people's emails, other people's emails that were not emails to you or from anyone, you know, or like, or it showed you like your friends' emails to other people.

535
00:33:26,074 --> 00:33:26,637
Scott: And it's like, what?

536
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,948
Scott: It's like, that's how it'd be messed up.

537
00:33:29,008 --> 00:33:29,169
Scott: Right.

538
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:33,390
Scott: It's like, just cause you're on Gmail, you're seeing all these other emails and that's Mastodon's choice.

539
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:34,515
Scott: Gmail could do that.

540
00:33:34,695 --> 00:33:42,282
Scott: Google could show you someone who could, if they wanted to, they could, they could just show you all the emails on Gmail between everybody.

541
00:33:42,302 --> 00:33:45,912
Scott: Um, you know, they just choose not to,

542
00:33:46,273 --> 00:33:47,957
Rym: but just saying if that's

543
00:33:48,018 --> 00:33:48,840
Scott: all got you down

544
00:33:49,301 --> 00:33:57,766
Rym: the GeekNights forum launched before Twitter and is still going for red forums are, uh, are art that has come

545
00:33:57,806 --> 00:33:58,811
Scott: and gone over the years,

546
00:33:59,193 --> 00:34:01,723
Rym: but I think they do something that other things don't do.

547
00:34:02,325 --> 00:34:04,893
Rym: And I would like to see a resurgence of forums again.

548
00:34:04,913 --> 00:34:05,977
Rym: Yep.

549
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:11,860
Rym: I like forums, forums are how, how you can type a lot of words without C C annoying all your friends.

550
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:12,000
Rym: Hmm.

551
00:34:13,322 --> 00:34:22,219
Rym: So berserker, uh, if you look at the cover, berserker is just Keanu Reeves, uh, the berserker.

552
00:34:22,902 --> 00:34:29,360
Rym: And it's a comic by Keanu Reeves and about a character who is clearly played by Keanu Reeves.

553
00:34:29,981 --> 00:34:30,222
Scott: Yeah.

554
00:34:30,362 --> 00:34:36,024
Scott: I'm not sure how much he's actually contributed to the writing, but he's listed as a co-writer.

555
00:34:36,123 --> 00:34:37,789
Rym: Yeah.

556
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:41,480
Scott: The other writer is Matt Kent from, you know, what was it?

557
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,203
Scott: The spy thing.

558
00:34:42,404 --> 00:34:42,625
Scott: Right.

559
00:34:42,725 --> 00:34:45,960
Scott: And, uh, what's the other one, the one that even had a board game.

560
00:34:46,701 --> 00:34:47,121
Rym: Oh God.

561
00:34:47,943 --> 00:34:49,306
Rym: Uh, I got to look at Wikipedia now.

562
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:51,129
Scott: Mind MGMT.

563
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:51,650
Scott: Right.

564
00:34:53,414 --> 00:34:53,694
Scott: Yeah.

565
00:34:54,616 --> 00:34:57,723
Rym: Pistol whip super spy super spy.

566
00:34:57,763 --> 00:34:59,551
Scott: That was the first time I heard of Matt Kent.

567
00:34:59,611 --> 00:35:00,153
Scott: I got that.

568
00:35:00,535 --> 00:35:00,675
Scott: Yeah.

569
00:35:00,735 --> 00:35:04,610
Scott: And mind MGMT is the one that also had a board game and people love that.

570
00:35:05,313 --> 00:35:11,140
Scott: Um, but yeah, since that super spy book that we got way long time ago, there's probably GeekNights episode about that.

571
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:12,904
Scott: Matt can't exploded.

572
00:35:12,924 --> 00:35:16,716
Scott: So now it's Matt Kent and Keanu Reeves co-writing, right?

573
00:35:17,398 --> 00:35:21,113
Scott: Uh, the artist is Ron Garney, uh, who I haven't heard of the cover.

574
00:35:21,133 --> 00:35:22,177
Scott: Your artist is Raphael.

575
00:35:22,218 --> 00:35:25,146
Scott: Grandpa, who I have heard of thinking and coloring bill Crabtree.

576
00:35:25,487 --> 00:35:30,120
Rym: And it's just a 12 issue comic about Keanu Reeves.

577
00:35:31,022 --> 00:35:35,324
Scott: Well, I don't know if there's going to be more issues maybe, but there's two volumes, two trade paperbacks.

578
00:35:35,364 --> 00:35:36,027
Scott: I have both of them.

579
00:35:36,729 --> 00:35:38,898
Scott: I read both of them and yeah, it's litter.

580
00:35:38,978 --> 00:35:43,137
Scott: It's like, you know how much Keanu Reeves himself contributed to the writing.

581
00:35:43,458 --> 00:35:45,142
Scott: It's like, it's basically.

582
00:35:45,242 --> 00:35:48,893
Scott: take what would have been a movie with him in it.

583
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:57,460
Scott: The cliche movie you expect him to be in, but it's like exact like typecasting him and just make it a comic book instead.

584
00:35:58,481 --> 00:35:58,862
Rym: Yup.

585
00:35:58,882 --> 00:36:03,956
Rym: What if John Wick was 80,000 years old and actually invulnerable.

586
00:36:04,838 --> 00:36:05,099
Scott: Right.

587
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:11,240
Rym: But he's, he's actually invulnerable, but it's like, I mean, John, maybe John Wick is just the berserker.

588
00:36:11,381 --> 00:36:13,051
Rym: Like he went through a, I'm going to be a mob hit man.

589
00:36:13,132 --> 00:36:13,937
Rym: He's not invulnerable.

590
00:36:13,957 --> 00:36:14,480
Scott: He's immortal.

591
00:36:14,701 --> 00:36:15,143
Scott: It's different.

592
00:36:15,525 --> 00:36:17,594
Rym: Well, he is both invulnerable and immortal.

593
00:36:17,915 --> 00:36:18,799
Scott: He's not invulnerable.

594
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:19,702
Scott: He takes lots of damage.

595
00:36:19,722 --> 00:36:21,026
Scott: He just always heals all the damage.

596
00:36:22,632 --> 00:36:27,611
Scott: They're very Wolverine like, but, uh, yeah, like it's like 10 X Wolverine, right?

597
00:36:27,631 --> 00:36:32,509
Scott: It's like, he could be turned into like, like one cell of his body remains.

598
00:36:32,609 --> 00:36:40,616
Rym: It's like, I mean, there are definitely multiple arcs where Wolverine comes back from a few cells or some DNA like that is, but not this quickly.

599
00:36:40,636 --> 00:36:41,299
Rym: Not quickly.

600
00:36:41,319 --> 00:36:46,965
Rym: I want to say the last time I saw Wolverine and already I haven't read comics in like a decade, at least X-Men comics.

601
00:36:47,367 --> 00:36:53,049
Rym: The last time I remember Wolverine coming back from almost nothing was like early 2000s.

602
00:36:53,089 --> 00:36:55,698
Scott: And the other thing is that Wolverine's skeleton, right?

603
00:36:55,838 --> 00:37:02,077
Scott: Is like somehow always, even though, you know, the Adam, at times the metal was removed from it.

604
00:37:02,237 --> 00:37:02,558
Scott: Yeah.

605
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:05,732
Rym: It's still, I assume it's Wolverine adamantium right now.

606
00:37:05,752 --> 00:37:07,179
Rym: I assume Wolverine is still alive.

607
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:08,504
Rym: I don't know what's going on with the X-Men.

608
00:37:08,524 --> 00:37:12,300
Scott: I mean, you know, it's not going to be Marvel comic books.

609
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:16,334
Scott: If there's no Wolverine in any of them right now, they would, why would they do that?

610
00:37:16,816 --> 00:37:23,003
Rym: So I guess the story of this, like what this is about, I've read the first volume and about a third of the second volume.

611
00:37:23,023 --> 00:37:24,089
Rym: Scott's obviously read all of it.

612
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:25,356
Rym: We're not going to spoil things.

613
00:37:25,436 --> 00:37:25,979
Rym: It's short.

614
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:27,906
Rym: Like this sounds cool to be more volumes.

615
00:37:27,966 --> 00:37:32,000
Rym: It's not over, but if this sounds good, like just read it.

616
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,386
Rym: Cause there's not that much of it out yet.

617
00:37:33,727 --> 00:37:34,993
Rym: And it's pretty good.

618
00:37:35,033 --> 00:37:35,535
Rym: And I like it.

619
00:37:35,596 --> 00:37:47,576
Rym: But basically the story is just, there's this super soldier currently working for the U S government who is like a berserker, like a classical, like I am a berserker.

620
00:37:47,716 --> 00:37:48,980
Rym: I go berserk and kill people.

621
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,063
Rym: I'm invincible.

622
00:37:50,625 --> 00:37:54,196
Rym: And I have spent 80,000 years being an invincible berserker.

623
00:37:54,216 --> 00:37:55,640
Rym: This is my story.

624
00:37:55,700 --> 00:38:05,249
Rym: We're currently at a stage where the government is studying him ostensibly to help him become mortal because that's all he wants in the world.

625
00:38:06,373 --> 00:38:11,013
Scott: And really it's like, yeah, he knows, he knows that they have their own secret purposes.

626
00:38:11,114 --> 00:38:11,254
Scott: Right.

627
00:38:11,295 --> 00:38:13,484
Scott: But he doesn't give a shit cause he's immortal.

628
00:38:13,604 --> 00:38:19,463
Rym: That's something I really like about this character is that he gives no fucks, what anyone thinks.

629
00:38:19,745 --> 00:38:20,669
Rym: And he's super open.

630
00:38:20,911 --> 00:38:22,820
Rym: The government's like, we're trying to help you.

631
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,368
Rym: He's like, no, you aren't.

632
00:38:24,409 --> 00:38:27,202
Rym: You're just trying to make a super soldier, but you know what, whatever.

633
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:28,747
Rym: I actually don't care.

634
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:32,461
Scott: Like he is just very direct and he's like, look, I don't want to die.

635
00:38:32,481 --> 00:38:33,063
Scott: All right.

636
00:38:33,163 --> 00:38:34,869
Scott: I just want to be able to die.

637
00:38:34,889 --> 00:38:46,430
Rym: And that is a nuance that I think a lot of immortal like stories about immortals miss is the, a lot of them are either I'm an immortal who wants to die or I'm an immortal who doesn't want to die.

638
00:38:46,571 --> 00:38:48,480
Rym: And there's a secret trick to kill me cause I'm evil.

639
00:38:48,962 --> 00:38:57,412
Rym: You don't often see the, I don't want to die, but I would like to at least know that I could in case in the future, I get bored or for any reason.

640
00:38:57,432 --> 00:38:57,673
Scott: Yeah.

641
00:38:57,814 --> 00:39:03,796
Scott: I mean, he knows like, you know, it's like, he's already lived so long since caveman time.

642
00:39:03,816 --> 00:39:08,399
Rym: He's probably worried that like earth will blow up in the distant future and he'll just write the sun explodes.

643
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:12,940
Scott: He could just be floating out there in space, painfully suffocating repeatedly for eternity.

644
00:39:13,061 --> 00:39:13,242
Scott: Right.

645
00:39:13,302 --> 00:39:16,518
Scott: It's like, you know, that's the kind of thing you might have to worry about.

646
00:39:16,538 --> 00:39:16,679
Scott: Yeah.

647
00:39:17,402 --> 00:39:30,636
Scott: So it's like, even if he's sitting there thinking, well, like, Hey, even if the U S you know, this government, you know, succeeds where, you know, Roman, whatever previous governments failed, he's like, they'll all be dead and I'll still be around and I'll do.

648
00:39:30,796 --> 00:39:32,443
Scott: some other government will be here in 200 years.

649
00:39:32,483 --> 00:39:33,186
Scott: What do I care?

650
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:37,805
Scott: But I also like, he's like technology, he's seen all of technology advance.

651
00:39:37,825 --> 00:39:41,302
Scott: He's like, Oh, maybe these people advance the technology enough that they could help me.

652
00:39:41,342 --> 00:39:42,025
Scott: Let's find out.

653
00:39:42,086 --> 00:39:42,668
Scott: Right.

654
00:39:43,191 --> 00:39:48,153
Scott: So he's going to like, he probably tries the same thing with like blood letters and leeches hundreds of years earlier.

655
00:39:48,194 --> 00:39:48,435
Rym: Yep.

656
00:39:48,455 --> 00:39:49,279
Rym: Going to shamans.

657
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:54,942
Rym: You definitely see in that one montage that he probably spent like a hundred years in a monastery just to see.

658
00:39:54,962 --> 00:39:55,023
Rym: Yep.

659
00:39:56,488 --> 00:39:57,411
Scott: Like, is this going to work?

660
00:39:57,471 --> 00:39:58,535
Scott: Is this going to work?

661
00:39:58,635 --> 00:40:04,834
Rym: But I guess one thing that's fun about it, uh, he is not just a humorless prick.

662
00:40:05,235 --> 00:40:10,880
Rym: Like you might expect between the character design and like that description of he gives no Fox and he's immortal and he's a berserker.

663
00:40:11,502 --> 00:40:14,270
Rym: He's like clearly tried everything.

664
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:17,018
Rym: Like he spent time just doing nothing.

665
00:40:17,058 --> 00:40:19,428
Rym: He spent time, basically he's doing nothing but having sex.

666
00:40:19,749 --> 00:40:22,080
Rym: He spent time like doing every possible thing.

667
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:25,311
Rym: He sort of tried everything and nothing works.

668
00:40:25,672 --> 00:40:27,540
Rym: And he's just trying to figure out what to do next.

669
00:40:27,781 --> 00:40:39,382
Rym: And it's just a, a moderately complex and fun take on that kind of immortal, super powerful character and the practical reality of what it would be like if you were just invincible effectively.

670
00:40:40,084 --> 00:40:40,285
Scott: Yeah.

671
00:40:40,345 --> 00:40:41,609
Scott: Volume two, right.

672
00:40:41,669 --> 00:40:43,976
Scott: Gets into like, how did he become this way?

673
00:40:43,996 --> 00:40:49,776
Scott: Uh, you know, and it's sort of nice in that I won't tell you what the explanation is, right.

674
00:40:49,876 --> 00:40:56,380
Scott: But it's sort of nice in that they're not like doing the one punch man deal where it's like, Ooh, was it this?

675
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,223
Scott: Was it that?

676
00:40:57,303 --> 00:40:58,187
Scott: Who knows?

677
00:40:58,268 --> 00:40:58,428
Scott: Right.

678
00:40:58,468 --> 00:41:00,759
Scott: And they're not doing the terrible secret of space.

679
00:41:00,819 --> 00:41:03,128
Scott: Like, here's a hit, but we're not going to tell you.

680
00:41:03,148 --> 00:41:06,500
Scott: They're like, they're like, this is what it was.

681
00:41:06,821 --> 00:41:07,102
Scott: Right.

682
00:41:07,463 --> 00:41:08,004
Scott: Absolutely.

683
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:09,369
Scott: This is the thing that did it.

684
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:19,221
Scott: We're not going to tell you all the details of, you know, exactly how that works, but it was definitely this thing right here that made this happen.

685
00:41:19,241 --> 00:41:21,024
Scott: Right.

686
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:22,608
Scott: Uh, so there you go.

687
00:41:23,008 --> 00:41:37,622
Rym: So, uh, if it's not obvious, this comic is hyper violence and it's sort of half of the panels are hyper violent, like intestines and blood just flying everywhere.

688
00:41:37,642 --> 00:41:42,660
Rym: And the other half of the panels look like an introspective two thousands comic.

689
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:43,821
Scott: Yeah.

690
00:41:43,841 --> 00:41:52,595
Scott: So it's like, it's not violent the way that like each of the killer is violent where it's trying to make you cringe or be grossed out or anything like that.

691
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:52,816
Scott: Right.

692
00:41:53,217 --> 00:41:56,889
Scott: What it is is imagine there was an action movie, right?

693
00:41:57,350 --> 00:42:08,666
Scott: But when someone got shot, what happened to their body is what would happens to a body when it gets shot or cut in half with a sword, but the body just keeps moving.

694
00:42:09,108 --> 00:42:09,268
Scott: Right.

695
00:42:09,288 --> 00:42:11,235
Scott: But the camera doesn't move away.

696
00:42:11,637 --> 00:42:11,858
Scott: Right.

697
00:42:11,898 --> 00:42:14,608
Scott: They're actually drawing, you know, it's a still image.

698
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:17,038
Scott: I think if this was like a movie, I'd probably get sick.

699
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:24,768
Scott: Maybe I don't, even though usually fake stuff doesn't affect me, but it's like, it's a, it doesn't bother me because it's a drawing.

700
00:42:24,788 --> 00:42:25,531
Scott: Right.

701
00:42:25,692 --> 00:42:31,173
Scott: But it's like the camera doesn't cut away and they draw what would happen to a body somewhat.

702
00:42:31,675 --> 00:42:35,870
Scott: Well, he's close to what would happen to a body if that horrible thing happened to it.

703
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:37,235
Rym: This is an immortal berserker.

704
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:47,468
Rym: So if you were fighting, say an army of people and you are literally immortal and you know that they can't actually hurt you, like how would you fight?

705
00:42:47,689 --> 00:42:51,783
Rym: And this kind of leans into what that might look like pretty hard.

706
00:42:52,325 --> 00:42:52,526
Scott: Yeah.

707
00:42:52,546 --> 00:42:53,490
Scott: He's like, he gets shot.

708
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:54,293
Scott: He keeps going.

709
00:42:54,334 --> 00:42:55,518
Scott: He gets a sword in him.

710
00:42:55,558 --> 00:42:56,261
Scott: He gets his arm cut.

711
00:42:56,281 --> 00:43:03,809
Rym: There's one scene where someone has a grenade and he just like grabs the grenade and just holds it in front of the guy and just waits for it to go off.

712
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:11,802
Scott: Like, yeah, that's, you know, that's the kind of thing, you know, you have this core concept and it's like, Hey, how can we play around with this?

713
00:43:11,883 --> 00:43:12,043
Scott: Right.

714
00:43:12,123 --> 00:43:13,909
Scott: What stuff can we make happen?

715
00:43:13,929 --> 00:43:17,078
Scott: You know, even that core conceit.

716
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,914
Rym: And there's a bunch of characters and they're all like interesting enough.

717
00:43:21,296 --> 00:43:23,586
Rym: Like it doesn't really zoom in on a lot of the characters.

718
00:43:23,606 --> 00:43:27,122
Rym: It seems like it mostly zooms in on him, the researchers working with him.

719
00:43:27,182 --> 00:43:34,835
Scott: I think it's, I think that's on purpose that a lot, you know, the only really characters to get any time are like, you know, the therapist and the scientist, right.

720
00:43:35,597 --> 00:43:38,287
Rym: Or people in his backstory, but even they aren't around long.

721
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:43,966
Scott: Well, there'll be some backstory people, you know, from you know, origin story.

722
00:43:43,986 --> 00:43:45,070
Scott: that gets a lot of time.

723
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:45,351
Scott: Right.

724
00:43:45,411 --> 00:43:53,669
Scott: But it's like, I think that's on purpose and it actually normally I'd complain and be like, ah, there aren't any other really cool characters other than the one guy.

725
00:43:53,729 --> 00:43:53,930
Scott: Right.

726
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:55,195
Scott: But it makes sense.

727
00:43:55,235 --> 00:44:01,398
Scott: Like being an immortal guy, anyone else in all of history is basically insignificant from his eyes.

728
00:44:01,498 --> 00:44:01,639
Scott: Right.

729
00:44:01,659 --> 00:44:03,208
Scott: It's like, there'll be around for like two seconds.

730
00:44:03,228 --> 00:44:04,214
Rym: Like who do you pay attention to?

731
00:44:04,234 --> 00:44:15,240
Rym: the handful of people who are heavily involved in your biz right now, or the handful of people who are so memorable that they stand out in 80,000 years of being a human running around being a berserker.

732
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:16,201
Scott: Right.

733
00:44:16,462 --> 00:44:26,067
Scott: Like Eve, let's say in, I don't know, some ancient time, say like, I don't know, Sumer in ancient Sumer, right.

734
00:44:26,107 --> 00:44:29,900
Scott: He was hanging out and he had a, he had a best friend at that time.

735
00:44:30,181 --> 00:44:33,657
Scott: I just making something up, but it's like, and that was like their best friend for 80 years.

736
00:44:34,701 --> 00:44:45,320
Scott: And from like befriended them as a child and they died old and he's still just this dude, the whole time he was a middle-aged dude for the 80 years of this other person's life.

737
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:47,773
Scott: That's a long time to live in an ancient time.

738
00:44:47,833 --> 00:44:48,055
Scott: Right.

739
00:44:48,377 --> 00:44:53,676
Scott: It's like, it's like that person would be like barely a footnote in this dude's life.

740
00:44:54,138 --> 00:44:54,981
Scott: So like, Yup.

741
00:44:55,424 --> 00:44:55,625
Rym: Right.

742
00:44:55,645 --> 00:44:58,000
Rym: Well, think about, think about how many awesome people you've met.

743
00:44:58,401 --> 00:44:59,685
Rym: Either of us have met in our lives.

744
00:44:59,725 --> 00:45:04,139
Rym: We live about 40 years, maybe 20, like 30 of those.

745
00:45:04,179 --> 00:45:07,330
Rym: We were mostly sentient, like 30, 35.

746
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:09,056
Rym: How many cool people have we met now?

747
00:45:09,156 --> 00:45:15,333
Rym: extrapolate how many cool people who are just as cooler or as cool or cooler that we would meet in 80,000 years.

748
00:45:15,373 --> 00:45:15,534
Rym: Right.

749
00:45:15,574 --> 00:45:24,382
Scott: So the book is sort of mirroring his own feelings of like, none of these other people are, are of any significance.

750
00:45:24,402 --> 00:45:27,092
Scott: So we're only going to spend time on them.

751
00:45:27,192 --> 00:45:35,479
Scott: as much as their significance is, you know, makes them worthy of being on the page, getting any character development or anything like that.

752
00:45:36,062 --> 00:45:40,120
Rym: But the character, like he is, he's more complex and nuanced than you might expect.

753
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:42,185
Rym: His he's not evil.

754
00:45:42,225 --> 00:45:43,670
Rym: Like he's not malicious.

755
00:45:43,972 --> 00:45:48,307
Rym: He's just kind of like, he's seen everything and he's kind of mostly done with stuff.

756
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:49,171
Scott: Yeah.

757
00:45:49,211 --> 00:45:51,199
Scott: He might've had an evil time, you know?

758
00:45:51,219 --> 00:45:53,507
Scott: Oh, let me try being an evil dictator one time.

759
00:45:54,109 --> 00:45:54,892
Scott: Let me know.

760
00:45:54,952 --> 00:45:59,008
Scott: But that time isn't at least the present, as far as the book is concerned.

761
00:45:59,028 --> 00:46:06,057
Scott: Like when the therapist comes over to his house, he's just like, I mean, I guess he's kind of evil doing like, you know, military, you know, whatever, but.

762
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:11,298
Rym: But when she comes over, like he's still like, he has, he drinks some scotch and hangs out.

763
00:46:11,338 --> 00:46:13,125
Rym: Like he still lives his life.

764
00:46:13,446 --> 00:46:15,212
Rym: It's not like to that extreme.

765
00:46:15,894 --> 00:46:21,277
Rym: And it's honestly, it's a pretty compelling concept, especially because it's not that long so far.

766
00:46:21,317 --> 00:46:23,769
Rym: And I don't know how long it's going to be, but I've enjoyed it.

767
00:46:23,809 --> 00:46:24,774
Rym: I'm going to read volume two.

768
00:46:25,056 --> 00:46:26,341
Rym: And if there's more, I'll keep reading it.

769
00:46:27,204 --> 00:46:27,445
Scott: Yeah.

770
00:46:27,546 --> 00:46:33,846
Scott: I mean, you know, they think the, the, uh, the effort to read this compared to what it is, right.

771
00:46:34,087 --> 00:46:35,511
Scott: Makes it a good value.

772
00:46:35,531 --> 00:46:36,253
Rym: Oh yeah.

773
00:46:36,273 --> 00:46:42,192
Scott: I don't think it's like Eisner award winning worthy or anything like that, but you'll get more.

774
00:46:42,272 --> 00:46:53,229
Rym: Imagine if you want a Wolverine ish story and you don't want to figure out what Wolverine to read right now, this is almost like a mainlining, a take on Wolverine played by Keanu Reeves.

775
00:46:55,876 --> 00:47:02,583
Scott: I don't know if it'll like, um, it's, it's a, it's an interesting thing to think about if someone's going to make like an adaptation of this.

776
00:47:02,684 --> 00:47:02,885
Scott: Right.

777
00:47:02,905 --> 00:47:05,696
Scott: Cause it's like, well, I saw like a whole point of this.

778
00:47:06,017 --> 00:47:16,660
Rym: I saw some talk that Keanu actually said he wanted it to be a comic because he wanted to do a kind of story that's hard to tell in a traditional movie, like having those juxtapositions with the panels.

779
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:17,981
Scott: Yeah.

780
00:47:18,583 --> 00:47:27,674
Scott: But it's almost like, you know, the dude could already as, or has already made at least two or three, many movies that are basically right along this line.

781
00:47:27,734 --> 00:47:27,975
Scott: Yup.

782
00:47:28,216 --> 00:47:28,477
Scott: Right.

783
00:47:28,858 --> 00:47:31,891
Scott: So it's like, you could have just gone directly to movie.

784
00:47:31,931 --> 00:47:39,944
Scott: It's like the fact that he went to comic instead, it makes it seem like this isn't one of those plays where you make the comic to make the move to sell the movie up.

785
00:47:40,467 --> 00:47:43,340
Scott: It's like, it seems like they just wanted to make the comic.

786
00:47:43,741 --> 00:47:44,002
Scott: Right.

787
00:47:44,022 --> 00:47:51,012
Rym: And then Keanu Reeves went to a studio and said, took this as a script and said, I want to make this movie and star in it.

788
00:47:51,072 --> 00:47:52,802
Rym: They would said, yes, they would say yes, please.

789
00:47:53,083 --> 00:47:55,114
Rym: And they would get funding cause it would definitely make money.

790
00:47:55,174 --> 00:47:55,958
Rym: Like they would just do it.

791
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:57,061
Scott: Yeah.

792
00:47:57,604 --> 00:48:00,135
Scott: So it's like, I think it's going to be comic only.

793
00:48:00,195 --> 00:48:05,173
Scott: It's like, Hey, you know, you got one of those, you know, I think every person in the movie biz, right.

794
00:48:05,234 --> 00:48:10,675
Scott: Sorta has a huge pile of scripts and ideas and things that didn't get released.

795
00:48:10,735 --> 00:48:18,020
Scott: And when I, you know, things that, probably like maybe a hundred movies die in some fashion in order for one to actually get made.

796
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:18,661
Scott: Right.

797
00:48:18,681 --> 00:48:26,027
Scott: So this is just, you know, what way to take one of those hundreds and put it into the world somehow in a published form.

798
00:48:26,047 --> 00:48:26,509
Scott: Right.

799
00:48:26,971 --> 00:48:33,982
Rym: But I love this, this note from this interview with Keanu, cause the way the interviewer is like, I couldn't help, but think a lot about Wolverine long.

800
00:48:34,022 --> 00:48:35,951
Rym: Like, were you thinking about Wolverine?

801
00:48:36,072 --> 00:48:40,352
Rym: And he started Keanu Reeves response with, I mean, for me, it's one of my favorite characters.

802
00:48:40,593 --> 00:48:41,879
Rym: that a strong influence on me.

803
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:45,600
Rym: It's impacted me, but we're also stepping into werewolves and vampires.

804
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:47,681
Scott: Yup.

805
00:48:48,985 --> 00:48:57,713
Scott: So I do think that if there's any chance of adaptation, it would be like, uh, like an animated Netflix dealy kind of, you know, you could do something cool with.

806
00:48:57,773 --> 00:48:58,576
Rym: it could happen.

807
00:48:59,319 --> 00:49:03,074
Rym: You can, or I could see, you know, the tie in video game.

808
00:49:03,094 --> 00:49:04,479
Rym: There's a lot of other ways they could go.

809
00:49:04,539 --> 00:49:08,593
Rym: if they wanted to like have adjacent properties, the video game would be like Wario.

810
00:49:08,634 --> 00:49:08,915
Scott: You can't.

811
00:49:08,935 --> 00:49:09,055
Scott: Wow.

812
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:11,021
Rym: Yeah.

813
00:49:11,121 --> 00:49:17,119
Rym: It's just make it like a dynasty warriors, but you can't, you literally just can't die.

814
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:20,731
Rym: And it's Wario like up the Chinese empire collapse.

815
00:49:20,811 --> 00:49:23,078
Scott: No, the whole, your goal is to die.

816
00:49:23,279 --> 00:49:23,560
Rym: Yeah.

817
00:49:25,581 --> 00:49:26,405
Scott: Try to die.

818
00:49:26,425 --> 00:49:27,148
Scott: All right.

819
00:49:27,188 --> 00:49:28,634
Scott: Well, all these guys are attacking you.

820
00:49:28,915 --> 00:49:29,899
Scott: Well, I'm trying to die.

821
00:49:29,919 --> 00:49:30,321
Scott: I'll let you know.

822
00:49:30,401 --> 00:49:31,104
Scott: I'd make it.

823
00:49:31,124 --> 00:49:32,028
Scott: You can't tell you.

824
00:49:32,048 --> 00:49:35,442
Rym: And if you quit the game, it ostensibly just keeps running.

825
00:49:35,703 --> 00:49:40,103
Rym: And when you come back, you're just laying there dead and you reform and like the clock has just moved forward.

826
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:44,275
Scott: You can't fast forward when you're reforming.

827
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:48,630
Rym: Maybe you're going to click a button to be reformed.

828
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:49,674
Rym: Like when is the next point?

829
00:49:49,714 --> 00:49:50,517
Rym: I'll be reformed.

830
00:49:51,159 --> 00:49:51,259
Scott: Yeah.

831
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:53,448
Scott: It's come back in 12 hours and we can play.

832
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:58,588
Scott: If you ever click that button and you know, you have to keep the game running for the 12 hours.

833
00:49:59,431 --> 00:50:00,474
Rym: Just make it one of those idlers.

834
00:50:00,574 --> 00:50:03,283
Rym: It's just him killing people and you just wait.

835
00:50:03,544 --> 00:50:04,426
Rym: You just get a kill count.

836
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:06,492
Scott: Oh, it never ends.

837
00:50:07,034 --> 00:50:07,215
Scott: I don't.

838
00:50:08,198 --> 00:50:11,522
Scott: Number goes up and history progresses like civilization.

839
00:50:18,208 --> 00:50:20,710
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

840

851
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:20,070
Rym: And those of you are probably saw this coming a mile away.

852
00:51:21,891 --> 00:51:23,772
Rym: You could come with me.

853
00:51:27,875 --> 00:51:34,018
Rym: My love for you is like a truck berserker.

854
00:51:35,859 --> 00:51:42,574
Rym: Do you want to making berserker berserker?

855
00:51:43,958 --> 00:51:44,820
Scott: Did he just say?
