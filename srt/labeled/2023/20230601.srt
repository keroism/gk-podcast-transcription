1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,189
Rym: It's Thursday, June 1st, 2023.

2
00:00:10,189 --> 00:00:10,390
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,484 --> 00:00:13,920
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,886
Rym: And this is the GeekNights Book Club.

5
00:00:15,946 --> 00:00:20,420
Rym: Tonight, we are talking about Sam and Rushdie's The Satanic Versus.

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,558
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,859
Rym: Yeah, we're gonna do this show a couple weeks ago, but of course I got sick, so here we are.

8
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,354
Scott: I was actually, I'm still like 5% sick maybe.

9
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,040
Scott: It was only like a two day sickness.

10
00:00:36,905 --> 00:00:37,400
Scott: I am only.

11
00:00:37,683 --> 00:00:39,219
Scott: I took it yesterday off work and that was it.

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,379
Rym: Yeah, I took a whole week off work for that cold.

13
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,828
Rym: Well, that sinus infection.

14
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:44,380
Rym: It was not a cold, it was bacterial.

15
00:00:46,494 --> 00:00:47,160
Rym: But that sucked.

16
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,900
Rym: So luckily, I took some notes so I'd remember to talk about the specific things.

17
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,280
Rym: I really got stuck in my craw reading this book.

18
00:00:54,380 --> 00:01:06,560
Rym: But I want to be very clear that one thing we're not going to do in this episode is get into much of the sociopolitical situation around this book.

19
00:01:06,763 --> 00:01:08,018
Rym: One, because we're not experts in it.

20
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,300
Rym: Two, because that would be longer than the book club episode.

21
00:01:11,461 --> 00:01:18,800
Rym: And three, because at least for me, in my opinion, I really want to engage with the novel as a novel with one exception.

22
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:31,200
Rym: Maybe two, but the exception that really stood out to me is I always assumed and knew that this book, because of the portrayal of Muhammad and the ladies and the situation.

23
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,800
Scott: Muhammad's not in this book, just a guy named Mahoud.

24
00:01:34,021 --> 00:01:37,040
Rym: Apparently in many translations, it's even more ambiguous.

25
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,079
Rym: He's just referred to as "the messenger" and that's it.

26
00:01:41,422 --> 00:01:43,560
Scott: That seems less ambiguous, but okay.

27
00:01:46,404 --> 00:01:54,840
Rym: But I guess I always sort of knew from learning history that that was the driver of this specific fatwa.

28
00:01:55,580 --> 00:02:03,689
Rym: But what no one told me, and I never knew until I got to a certain part later in the book, when a certain Imam appears,

29
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:04,532
Scott: and that

30
00:02:04,592 --> 00:02:20,540
Rym: is definitely just a parody of Khomeini, and I'm pretty sure Khomeini was specifically personally mad about that, and that was probably the impetus for him more so than this over other books that transgressed to a similar degree at the time.

31
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:27,120
Rym: I feel like that was a bigger part of that situation than what I learned in high school led me to believe.

32
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:28,385
Scott: Well, it could be.

33
00:02:29,188 --> 00:02:39,856
Scott: The way I saw it is that if I was a religious fundamentalist, the part that really believed, the part of this book that would make me the most mad, at least I'm guessing.

34
00:02:40,521 --> 00:02:41,638
Rym: Yeah, because I can think of a few parts.

35
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:52,318
Scott: Right, but the part that I think might make such a person the most angry was the part where it was like, at first, Mahoud was getting messages from the angel Gabriel.

36
00:02:53,722 --> 00:02:58,919
Scott: But then, he was just sort of, you know, anytime he wanted something, right?

37
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,657
Scott: Saying, you know, be like, do what I say, why should we do what you say?

38
00:03:04,858 --> 00:03:05,500
Scott: Close my eyes.

39
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,120
Scott: Gabriel just told me to, now do it, right?

40
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:16,494
Scott: It's like there's that whole part where it's like just obviously portraying the prophet as just a liar who's making shit up to get his way.

41
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,540
Rym: With, of course, we'll get into the allegory of, was it the other way around?

42
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:30,400
Rym: And it was the modern person using this internal metaphor of their idea of Muhammad to process their own traumas and interactions.

43
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:46,859
Rym: But anyway, the other part that I could see was the specific nature of the fact that it was Indian Muslims portrayed primarily in the book, in the primary story, because that is where the original riots occurred and the fatwa came after that.

44
00:03:49,003 --> 00:04:04,420
Rym: And it made, like, the cross-cultural part of that actually led to significant amounts of that anger early, because it intersected with an already persecuted in a different way from other Islamic communities situation, so there was a lot more going on there.

45
00:04:05,061 --> 00:04:11,548
Rym: And until I read this book, I didn't actually know that it was about Indian Muslims, as opposed, like, I didn't know that.

46
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:13,740
Rym: I just knew very broad strokes about the story.

47
00:04:14,222 --> 00:04:17,159
Scott: I knew nothing about the content of the actual novel till I read it.

48
00:04:17,682 --> 00:04:18,027
Scott: I knew.

49
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:18,676
Scott: I mean, I knew.

50
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,999
Scott: I was like, when I was reading the first chapter, I was like, what the fuck is going on?

51
00:04:24,561 --> 00:04:29,879
Scott: And then eventually you realize what's going on, like, oh, it's a hijacking, like about, you know, pages in.

52
00:04:32,042 --> 00:04:40,100
Rym: And that is definitely, talk about, of all the, you know, there's some books you read where there's, like, a slow build up and then you're like, okay, I see where this book is going.

53
00:04:40,421 --> 00:04:45,849
Rym: But some books just come in and hit you over the head with a hammer of like, what the fuck's going on?

54
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:46,797
Rym: Bam, bam, bam, bam.

55
00:04:47,361 --> 00:04:51,560
Rym: And then you get through a chapter or two and then you're like, oh, okay, I see what's going on.

56
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,303
Rym: I see where we are.

57
00:04:52,323 --> 00:04:56,900
Scott: And I kind of like, it sort of starts like you're on a plane with these two dudes.

58
00:04:57,561 --> 00:05:06,055
Scott: And it's like, you understand that these two dudes knew each other from somewhere and are on the plane and together and it's sort of murky, right?

59
00:05:07,861 --> 00:05:13,540
Scott: And then it's like, usually you expect like a novel wants to grab people on the first page, right?

60
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,519
Scott: That's what they always tell you to do.

61
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,519
Rym: And it did grab me, but not in the normal way.

62
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:17,241
Scott: Right.

63
00:05:17,361 --> 00:05:25,620
Scott: But it's like, you know, it's not until several pages in where it's like the clouds begin to clear and it's like, it's a hijacking and they're going to die immediately.

64
00:05:29,122 --> 00:05:39,360
Rym: And also the way that opening scene was written just really struck me as that's where, that's where I recognize too, because I'd never read any of Simon Rushdie's works other than a couple of essays and short articles and interviews.

65
00:05:40,582 --> 00:05:41,868
Scott: If I have, I don't remember this.

66
00:05:41,888 --> 00:05:44,480
Scott: So as far as I know, this is the only thing I've written.

67
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:51,340
Rym: So I guess I didn't expect just not knowing the sheer amount of poetry and like the way the writing was.

68
00:05:51,841 --> 00:05:56,480
Rym: So it almost felt like, wait, there's some guys on a plane and then poetry exploded the plane.

69
00:05:56,621 --> 00:05:59,200
Rym: Like it felt like poems came in and things exploded.

70
00:05:59,662 --> 00:06:04,980
Rym: And I, it took me a while to figure out that wasn't an allegory or a metaphor, at least in that context.

71
00:06:05,571 --> 00:06:06,020
Scott: Or was it?

72
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:10,760
Rym: Well, I would say reading it at first, like, wait, is this an allegory?

73
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,920
Rym: Followed by, no, this is literally happening.

74
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:17,000
Rym: Followed by, wait, this, this is an allegory by multiple steps.

75
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:25,595
Rym: Followed like in the first chapter to the first chapter with, oh, so now they just fell to the ground and they're in London.

76
00:06:25,615 --> 00:06:26,079
Rym: Okay.

77
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:26,702
Scott: Right.

78
00:06:27,183 --> 00:06:38,824
Scott: So I don't know if there's like some actual, like if I would talk to like a literature professor and they would actually be able to define what the difference is between like fantasy and magical realism or any of those sorts of,

79
00:06:38,904 --> 00:06:43,578
Rym: Wikipedia says this is in the genre of magical realism straight up

80
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:44,120
Scott: for whatever.

81
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:51,220
Scott: So it's like, you know, it takes place in the eighties, at least the main plot takes place in the eighties.

82
00:06:51,681 --> 00:06:56,938
Scott: But there are also dream sequences which take place in the past world.

83
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,300
Rym: One feels like it's in the seventies, like the one with the Amman, I'd say.

84
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:03,990
Rym: One feels like it takes place in a vague period.

85
00:07:04,472 --> 00:07:06,480
Rym: One is definitely like the founding of Islam.

86
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:07,641
Scott: Yeah.

87
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:12,239
Scott: And a few of them take place, like in the different places on earth at the same time.

88
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:20,340
Rym: Well, the one with the Boyarder, the one with the, the South American Nazi and that whole situation, like that era.

89
00:07:21,124 --> 00:07:24,199
Scott: The pilgrimage takes place at the same time as the, yeah.

90
00:07:25,581 --> 00:07:34,976
Scott: But it's like, you know, you can in a lot of books with that have dream sequences and things like that, you might be questioning like what's real, what's not real, or at least nothing's real.

91
00:07:35,016 --> 00:07:35,920
Scott: It's all a work of fiction.

92
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:41,940
Scott: But like, you know, but it's like within the world of the fiction, what's real and what's not real.

93
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:47,440
Scott: And the thing is, it's like the whole thing could be not real if they died in the plane crash, which they could have.

94
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:47,841
Scott: Right.

95
00:07:47,902 --> 00:07:50,131
Scott: It's like it could all be so great.

96
00:07:50,412 --> 00:07:51,837
Rym: And this is a credit to Sam and Rushdie.

97
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:58,700
Rym: Gabriel considers that that is a possibility at multiple points in this book.

98
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,006
Rym: Like he thinks to himself, like, did I die?

99
00:08:01,027 --> 00:08:01,528
Rym: Is it?

100
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:05,720
Rym: I think Saladin actually does, too, when he's turning into a goat in that scene.

101
00:08:06,021 --> 00:08:08,832
Rym: I remember there's a moment where he's like, this is too absurd.

102
00:08:08,852 --> 00:08:10,780
Rym: I must have just died in that plane crash.

103
00:08:10,921 --> 00:08:12,570
Rym: And this is just like, maybe I'm in the hospital.

104
00:08:12,872 --> 00:08:13,516
Rym: That's got to be it.

105
00:08:13,556 --> 00:08:14,260
Rym: I'm in the hospital.

106
00:08:14,842 --> 00:08:15,023
Scott: Yep.

107
00:08:15,284 --> 00:08:17,453
Scott: So these two dudes die in a plane crash.

108
00:08:17,473 --> 00:08:18,337
Scott: Who were these two dudes?

109
00:08:18,377 --> 00:08:19,080
Scott: He got Chamsha.

110
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,744
Scott: Chamsha Saladin.

111
00:08:21,326 --> 00:08:23,876
Scott: He's a guy who is a voice actor.

112
00:08:24,096 --> 00:08:24,337
Scott: Right.

113
00:08:24,357 --> 00:08:25,120
Scott: And he's from India.

114
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:25,962
Rym: We'll get back to that.

115
00:08:26,002 --> 00:08:30,860
Rym: The fact that he's a voice actor is like super, super important to what this book is about.

116
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,807
Scott: He's a super talented voice actor from India.

117
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:42,452
Scott: But he's one of those people who, you know, is an immigrant who is, I guess, you know, I guess in modern day, you would consider him like a London weeb.

118
00:08:42,511 --> 00:08:43,395
Scott: Is there a word for that?

119
00:08:43,414 --> 00:08:43,977
Scott: Right.

120
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,363
Scott: It's like, I think of.

121
00:08:46,403 --> 00:08:49,492
Scott: like, you know, the white dudes who go to Japan.

122
00:08:49,793 --> 00:08:50,133
Scott: Right.

123
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:52,560
Scott: And are like, you know, all in on Japan.

124
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,705
Scott: Japan is the best.

125
00:08:53,765 --> 00:08:56,820
Rym: And they shun their original place they came from.

126
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:03,020
Rym: If this book were set today, he would be wearing a t-shirt with like a picture of Queen Victoria on it, unironically.

127
00:09:03,962 --> 00:09:04,143
Scott: Yeah.

128
00:09:04,204 --> 00:09:06,800
Scott: Or like what's the, you know, keep calm, whatever.

129
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:13,400
Rym: This is the kind of person who would like follow gossip of the royal family and like driving Austin Powers car.

130
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,281
Scott: Yeah.

131
00:09:14,481 --> 00:09:15,964
Scott: It's like he's that right.

132
00:09:17,346 --> 00:09:24,900
Scott: So it's like, you know, even though he's from India, it's like he changed his name to be less, you know, ethnic, I guess whatever word you want to use.

133
00:09:25,561 --> 00:09:34,158
Rym: But also in a way more ethnic in that he almost makes it like more the stereotype of what people would expect, which fit with it.

134
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:35,260
Rym: There's a lot going on there.

135
00:09:36,982 --> 00:09:37,162
Scott: Right.

136
00:09:37,403 --> 00:09:39,007
Scott: And then so you got give real.

137
00:09:39,067 --> 00:09:42,496
Scott: now give real is sort of like, you know, he's.

138
00:09:42,536 --> 00:09:43,458
Scott: he's also an actor.

139
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:44,020
Scott: Right.

140
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,591
Scott: But he's an actor in India, a movie actor.

141
00:09:47,651 --> 00:09:48,855
Scott: He appears on screen.

142
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:49,396
Scott: Right.

143
00:09:49,597 --> 00:09:50,500
Rym: Not just a movie actor.

144
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:58,896
Rym: He is like the biggest actor at the time, like he is in Indian cinema, the most important and famous person.

145
00:09:58,996 --> 00:10:00,860
Rym: And to the fact that even globally, he's well known.

146
00:10:01,381 --> 00:10:03,567
Scott: But he's always in movies.

147
00:10:03,587 --> 00:10:08,020
Scott: He's always portraying like gods and heroes and legendary figures.

148
00:10:08,601 --> 00:10:08,881
Scott: Right.

149
00:10:10,464 --> 00:10:15,832
Scott: And, you know, he is not even though he's, you know, is a worldly person.

150
00:10:16,112 --> 00:10:16,413
Scott: Right.

151
00:10:16,493 --> 00:10:20,519
Scott: He is the opposite in that he has not thrown away his Indian ness.

152
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,160
Scott: Right.

153
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:25,047
Scott: But he's very not conservative.

154
00:10:25,087 --> 00:10:30,499
Scott: Like he's getting with all the ladies and being all, you know, Hollywood style.

155
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:30,960
Scott: Right.

156
00:10:33,401 --> 00:10:43,600
Scott: So you got these two guys and they're on a plane, which is hijacked and basically one of them metaphorically, allegorically and literally becomes an angel.

157
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:51,460
Rym: And one of them becomes a demon, though there's a little bit of a an indication that they flipped at some point like that.

158
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,101
Scott: Right.

159
00:10:52,141 --> 00:10:55,085
Scott: So that's the thing is like you look at both of them and it's like.

160
00:10:55,365 --> 00:11:06,760
Scott: it's not clearly like, you know, if you just look at these characters, there isn't a clear like, you know, good guy, bad guy deal the way there might be in like, you know, an anime where it's like, ah, yes.

161
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,505
Scott: You know, the Gundam pilot is good and char is bad.

162
00:11:10,565 --> 00:11:10,846
Scott: Right.

163
00:11:10,866 --> 00:11:12,168
Scott: It's like, I mean, it's not like.

164
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:20,060
Rym: in a lot of ways they're both kind of bad with a big asterisk there in that they both do a lot of shitty things.

165
00:11:20,521 --> 00:11:23,832
Rym: But the angel actually does more shitty things.

166
00:11:23,932 --> 00:11:26,400
Rym: I would say like his crimes are arguably greater.

167
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,822
Scott: It's it's tough to say.

168
00:11:28,903 --> 00:11:29,123
Scott: Right.

169
00:11:29,183 --> 00:11:38,760
Scott: But, yeah, they have each have, you know, positive and also, you know, they have aspects that you can look at as laudable and aspects that you can look at is not so laudable.

170
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,081
Scott: Right.

171
00:11:39,522 --> 00:11:45,296
Scott: And, you know, the first thing that tips you off to who's good, who's bad is after they crash and they might be dead.

172
00:11:45,336 --> 00:11:46,158
Scott: But that doesn't matter.

173
00:11:46,619 --> 00:11:46,820
Scott: Right.

174
00:11:47,181 --> 00:11:48,826
Scott: They're they're alive somehow.

175
00:11:49,227 --> 00:11:50,852
Scott: Only them to no one else on the plane.

176
00:11:50,873 --> 00:11:53,200
Scott: You don't hear anything about anyone else who is on that plane.

177
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:54,542
Rym: Yeah.

178
00:11:55,324 --> 00:12:01,740
Scott: And there they get rescued on some island or on a beach or something by some old lady on a beach in the English coast somewhere.

179
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,443
Rym: And that is the whole thing.

180
00:12:03,564 --> 00:12:05,730
Scott: But a very depopulated place.

181
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:06,311
Scott: Right.

182
00:12:06,331 --> 00:12:08,898
Scott: But basically the cops come.

183
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:09,660
Scott: Right.

184
00:12:10,502 --> 00:12:16,620
Scott: And the cops, when they arrive, arrest Chamcha for like being an illegal immigrant.

185
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,482
Rym: And they totally ignore Gabriel.

186
00:12:18,763 --> 00:12:20,787
Rym: There's no difference between them except.

187
00:12:20,867 --> 00:12:27,320
Rym: And this is where the allegory and like the way this is portrayed gets murky and interesting and interwoven.

188
00:12:27,741 --> 00:12:35,100
Rym: Because on one hand, Gabriel's glowing in the book and has like almost a halo and Saladin is starting to grow horns.

189
00:12:35,361 --> 00:12:39,069
Rym: So that's that is happening from the magical literally happening.

190
00:12:39,851 --> 00:12:41,876
Rym: But and his breath became sulfurous.

191
00:12:41,976 --> 00:12:43,199
Rym: that like that is the thing as well.

192
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:50,409
Rym: But simultaneously, if you treat that as pure allegory, you've got.

193
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:58,040
Rym: Gabriel happens to go into the wardrobe of this woman's house and put on like an English smoking jacket.

194
00:12:58,762 --> 00:13:01,728
Rym: And Chamcha is too sick and doesn't get up right away.

195
00:13:01,768 --> 00:13:07,060
Rym: So when the cops come, they see two strangers who are clearly not white people.

196
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,599
Rym: And the only difference between them is one of them looks like he should be there to their biased eyes and one of them doesn't.

197
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,909
Rym: So they arrest the one who's not wearing an English smoking jacket.

198
00:13:17,451 --> 00:13:20,540
Scott: And Gabriel does nothing to speak up and save.

199
00:13:22,023 --> 00:13:22,745
Scott: He just stands there.

200
00:13:22,765 --> 00:13:24,709
Scott: He just lets the police take him.

201
00:13:24,829 --> 00:13:29,800
Scott: And then as a result, Chamcha suffers greatly and now hates Gabriel a lot.

202
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,958
Rym: Tries to kill him several times.

203
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,127
Scott: He's like, fuck that guy.

204
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,390
Scott: He just let me get arrested.

205
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:39,780
Scott: And I had to suffer with the cops being pieces of shit and everything.

206
00:13:40,421 --> 00:13:52,360
Rym: And it's very clear, like if anyone's missing the super obvious lit crit like analysis conversation here that a reading of this scene and this this reading is throughout the entire book.

207
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,845
Rym: But this seems such a good example of it.

208
00:13:54,427 --> 00:13:56,033
Rym: It is very clearly because think about it.

209
00:13:56,334 --> 00:13:57,900
Rym: The voice actor gets arrested.

210
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:05,940
Rym: The movie star doesn't, which also leads to who passes more in the dominant culture of the place they've immigrated to.

211
00:14:06,441 --> 00:14:08,405
Rym: And thus they're treated very differently.

212
00:14:09,006 --> 00:14:15,860
Scott: And Chamcha is more of a person, you know, he's a person like, you know, of London in every way.

213
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,421
Scott: Yeah.

214
00:14:16,501 --> 00:14:19,408
Scott: It's like, you know, he loves, you know, he loves London food.

215
00:14:19,448 --> 00:14:20,350
Scott: Like his spirit.

216
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:24,280
Rym: He is more a Londoner than a lot of English people by birth.

217
00:14:24,581 --> 00:14:32,619
Rym: Yet he looks more foreign to the white people, which ties back to the fact that there's a reason he was only ever allowed to be a voice actor.

218
00:14:33,981 --> 00:14:44,060
Rym: Meanwhile, Gabriel passes effectively more appearance wise, yet he is much less of that spiritually and personally.

219
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,525
Rym: Like he's, well, he's got a whole other thing going on.

220
00:14:46,565 --> 00:14:47,507
Rym: It's not like they're opposites.

221
00:14:47,527 --> 00:14:49,271
Rym: Gabriel's a little more insane as a character than Chamcha.

222
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:57,007
Scott: He gets more insane and less insane at different times.

223
00:14:57,449 --> 00:15:00,657
Scott: But he's, you know, he's definitely lost it.

224
00:15:01,118 --> 00:15:01,900
Scott: He's lost the plot.

225
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:05,187
Rym: But the way they're written is also just fantastic.

226
00:15:05,227 --> 00:15:11,640
Rym: Like their dialogue and like Chamcha, it's interesting how Chamcha is almost the more level headed one most of the time.

227
00:15:12,261 --> 00:15:20,118
Rym: Like in the police car and a lot of scenes when weird stuff's happening, he is almost always like, wait, is this really happening or am I going crazy?

228
00:15:20,158 --> 00:15:20,800
Rym: What's going on?

229
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,388
Rym: Gabriel definitely just rolls with it more before he has that revelation.

230
00:15:25,408 --> 00:15:26,911
Rym: And that happens repeatedly.

231
00:15:27,392 --> 00:15:31,200
Rym: Like he's less connected to humanity as a character than Chamcha is.

232
00:15:32,242 --> 00:15:37,774
Scott: Alright, so these two main characters and their plot is like driving the rest of the story.

233
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:40,180
Scott: It's like the thread that's holding everything else together.

234
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:50,300
Scott: But there's basically several other smaller novels that are all linked in some way to them, a little bit at least.

235
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:57,029
Scott: And it's this huge book, I guess not huge, but it's larger than most.

236
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,773
Scott: It's not like a war and peace deal.

237
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:00,414
Scott: We finished it.

238
00:16:00,515 --> 00:16:03,960
Scott: It was easier to read than Tale of Genji.

239
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,733
Rym: Honestly, I blew through it just because it was compelling.

240
00:16:07,034 --> 00:16:08,060
Rym: Like it was a good read.

241
00:16:08,581 --> 00:16:10,903
Scott: Yeah, by several orders of magnitude.

242
00:16:13,246 --> 00:16:16,650
Scott: But it's not one of those books where he's got one thing to say.

243
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:25,480
Scott: He's got several things to say and he just managed to orchestrate and get all these pieces to fit together into one cohesive puzzle.

244
00:16:28,281 --> 00:16:30,946
Rym: And it worked because sometimes you're reading a book.

245
00:16:31,347 --> 00:16:38,600
Rym: The Princeton Nothing books did this to me a few times, but it's pretty common in books where a novel has a bunch of different threads that may or may not be super interconnected.

246
00:16:39,201 --> 00:16:42,129
Rym: And you get really invested in one and then it jumps to another one.

247
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:43,031
Rym: you don't care about that much.

248
00:16:43,051 --> 00:16:43,653
Rym: You're like, "Ah,

249
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:44,114
Rym: shit.".

250
00:16:44,134 --> 00:16:46,300
Rym: You're like almost slogging through it to get back to the good part.

251
00:16:46,741 --> 00:16:51,519
Rym: But this one, every time it jumped to a different perspective, it pulled me right along with it.

252
00:16:52,741 --> 00:16:55,609
Scott: Yeah, I don't think there was any of them that I cared more or less about.

253
00:16:55,629 --> 00:16:58,537
Scott: There wasn't like, "Oh, this is the good one and the other ones I don't care

254
00:16:58,597 --> 00:16:58,778
Scott: about.".

255
00:16:58,818 --> 00:16:59,139
Scott: That part.

256
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:05,159
Rym: The Jahilius story, like the first dreams, that was the one that I found the most compelling partly because I'm interested in...

257
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:09,211
Scott: Well, that's the part about the literal title of the book, the Satanic Verses, right?

258
00:17:09,231 --> 00:17:12,319
Scott: So for that reason, that was the most, you know...

259
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:23,160
Rym: Well, also because that one, another way to look at those dreams, because there's like four of them... Four or five, depending on how you count, because some of them are short or not necessarily... Anyway.

260
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:35,640
Rym: I'd say that they're all echoes of each other because it's almost the same type of story in the dreams happening over and over again, but in a different era with a different context.

261
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:44,060
Rym: But it's the same human lens of the players in the story, like rationalizing the decisions they're making.

262
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:44,980
Scott: Yeah.

263
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:57,240
Scott: Well, I mean, you have these separate stories that are somehow tied together either because Gabriel's dreaming them or because they're actually taking place in the same world and there's some minor linkage or, you know, whatever reason.

264
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:03,129
Scott: But they all have characters that line up with each other, right?

265
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:06,073
Scott: The biggest one is the three or four Aishas.

266
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:10,520
Scott: It feels like almost every one of the different stories has an Aisha in it, right?

267
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:23,640
Scott: And it's like, you know, the same way that like you might read, you know, a normal novel and it's like, ah, this person in the novel is representing Jesus, even though... Right?

268
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:39,840
Scott: And it's like, you know, it's allegory in that sense, whereas in here, rather than... They do have the external, you know, references like, ah, my hound is Mohammed, but they also have internal ones where it's like, we'll make a character and we'll make another character, right?

269
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:43,725
Rym: Well, like Hind, the Sultan's wife from Jahalia.

270
00:18:43,826 --> 00:18:45,889
Rym: And then you've got Hind in London.

271
00:18:46,409 --> 00:18:51,477
Rym: And those two characters are not the same, but there's a bunch of echoes between the two of them.

272
00:18:51,517 --> 00:18:53,880
Rym: Like they're tied narratively, but not directly.

273
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,101
Scott: Yeah.

274
00:18:55,682 --> 00:18:59,588
Scott: And it's not always so blatant with the same name characters, right?

275
00:18:59,909 --> 00:19:02,393
Scott: Because you've got the angel Gabriel, right?

276
00:19:02,794 --> 00:19:06,100
Scott: You've got Gabriel with a similar name, right?

277
00:19:06,781 --> 00:19:12,230
Scott: But Gabriel is, you know, having these wild dreams and it's sort of like he's receiving.

278
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:18,620
Scott: that, you know, by dreaming, he is receiving, you know, I guess, prophecy in these dreams.

279
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,540
Rym: And that's what he's talking about.

280
00:19:19,961 --> 00:19:25,334
Scott: The same way that, yeah, because the only thing, you know, I didn't, I still don't know much about the Quran, right?

281
00:19:25,374 --> 00:19:27,600
Scott: But I tried to do at least some research, right?

282
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:40,338
Scott: And the main key thing to know, you know, I think possibly the only thing you really need to know about the Quran to understand this book is that, you know, I'm a Jew, so I know about the Old Testament, right?

283
00:19:40,358 --> 00:19:41,640
Scott: The five books of Moses.

284
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,443
Scott: Why are they called the five books of Moses?

285
00:19:43,523 --> 00:19:50,413
Scott: Because supposedly, obviously not truly, but supposedly Moses walking through the fucking desert, right?

286
00:19:51,074 --> 00:19:55,540
Scott: After he freed the people from Egypt and God was like, yo, Moses, write this shit down, right?

287
00:19:56,001 --> 00:19:58,404
Scott: And so Moses wrote five books down, right?

288
00:19:58,805 --> 00:20:00,888
Scott: And so the Quran is supposedly.

289
00:20:01,429 --> 00:20:07,157
Scott: there was a dude named Mohammed and the angel Gabriel was like, yo, Mohammed, write this down, right?

290
00:20:07,237 --> 00:20:08,960
Scott: And that what he wrote down was the Quran.

291
00:20:09,521 --> 00:20:16,616
Scott: So in the book, you have my hound receiving prophecy from Gabriel and not writing it down.

292
00:20:16,676 --> 00:20:18,400
Scott: Someone else wrote it down for him because he couldn't write.

293
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:24,947
Scott: And you've got Gabriel receiving dreams, right, from who knows where, right?

294
00:20:25,207 --> 00:20:34,840
Scott: And you've got, was it one of the Aishas, right, is receiving, you know, prophecy that tells her to go walk into the water.

295
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:38,288
Scott: Yeah, definitely.

296
00:20:38,308 --> 00:20:41,480
Rym: It is very clear that nobody actually made it through that water.

297
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,060
Scott: Yeah, obviously.

298
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:59,654
Rym: But when those dreams are happening, and this is where, because not to compare this to all the nerdy stuff we often talk about, but like one of the things we always praised utenna as an anime for was that it weren't like if you take the allegory at any level or

299
00:21:00,035 --> 00:21:00,695
Scott: decide

300
00:21:00,755 --> 00:21:05,460
Rym: which parts to follow, they're still very self-consistent and still tell the same story a different way.

301
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:18,740
Rym: And that happens here, too, because one reading of those dreams in prophecy is literally the Mohammed or my hound received prophecy from the angel Gabriel as manifested in the future.

302
00:21:18,921 --> 00:21:24,260
Rym: And you could have a time thing like the future affects the past or the past affects the future because it could be the other way around.

303
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:46,439
Rym: Modern Gabriel is receiving these dreams from the past in some magical way, but in those sequences repeatedly Gabriel keeps like almost noting that he has no power over it and whoever he's receiving the dream from kind of takes control and speaks the words they want to hear into him and they come back out of him.

304
00:21:47,901 --> 00:22:00,320
Rym: Which could imply more that it's two different people in two different eras who are speaking to a non-existent internal angel to rationalize the decisions they were going to make anyway.

305
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:09,420
Rym: Because there's multiple points where someone says, oh, and like right back to the beginning, the satanic verses, oh, well, God, the angel told me this, but Satan told me that.

306
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,529
Rym: And even in that scene, I think Gabriel says something to the reader.

307
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:18,780
Rym: I just remember this line because I made a note about it, something to the effect of, but it was me both times.

308
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:19,641
Scott: Right.

309
00:22:19,661 --> 00:22:20,703
Scott: Well, OK, so we got to get to that.

310
00:22:20,763 --> 00:22:20,944
Scott: Right.

311
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:27,600
Scott: So first of all, this book has some unnamed narrator who is a character.

312
00:22:28,962 --> 00:22:30,125
Rym: I would argue on one level.

313
00:22:30,205 --> 00:22:38,700
Rym: that unnamed narrator I thought was the base internal monologue of all humans that people interpret as divine.

314
00:22:39,221 --> 00:22:48,780
Rym: But I also wondered if that was if it's more magical, the actual Angel Gabriel who has been inserting himself or itself into these characters along the way.

315
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:50,464
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

316
00:22:50,484 --> 00:22:57,600
Scott: That's what makes it, you know, the kind of book that I like is that, you know, I've been ranting about this constantly over the past year or few.

317
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,081
Scott: Right.

318
00:22:58,121 --> 00:23:01,325
Scott: Is that there are some works of fiction across all mediums.

319
00:23:01,786 --> 00:23:02,026
Scott: Right.

320
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:11,480
Scott: And especially today, the popular ones, the serials on television, especially where they're all about the only question they ask of the audience is what happens next?

321
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:12,922
Scott: And then they answer it.

322
00:23:13,162 --> 00:23:13,422
Scott: Right.

323
00:23:13,983 --> 00:23:16,306
Scott: And then there's no questioning.

324
00:23:16,646 --> 00:23:16,927
Scott: Right.

325
00:23:17,227 --> 00:23:27,360
Scott: So I think, you know, a good example would be like those who's the guy who makes the movies, like the who's the guy who said the Inception, the Inception movie guy and the.

326
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,644
Scott: Oh, did you also do Interstellar?

327
00:23:29,684 --> 00:23:30,165
Scott: Same guy.

328
00:23:30,185 --> 00:23:31,368
Rym: Nolan and all them.

329
00:23:31,428 --> 00:23:31,829
Rym: I'm trying to think.

330
00:23:31,849 --> 00:23:32,170
Rym: Yeah.

331
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:32,471
Scott: Right.

332
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:35,297
Scott: So his he creates this wild thing.

333
00:23:35,598 --> 00:23:35,939
Scott: Right.

334
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,903
Rym: There's no allegory there.

335
00:23:37,923 --> 00:23:38,704
Rym: Right.

336
00:23:38,764 --> 00:23:41,911
Scott: And then he at the end of the movie, he basically explains it.

337
00:23:42,111 --> 00:23:42,331
Scott: Right.

338
00:23:42,552 --> 00:23:42,913
Scott: He's like.

339
00:23:42,953 --> 00:23:46,480
Scott: he's like, you know, it's like, sure, at the end of Inception, spoilers.

340
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:46,680
Scott: Right.

341
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,325
Scott: It's like they cut away before the top stops spinning.

342
00:23:49,405 --> 00:23:50,107
Scott: If it does.

343
00:23:50,127 --> 00:23:56,860
Rym: I would argue and I'm going to say something mean a lot of people mistake not answering that question for being deep.

344
00:23:57,741 --> 00:23:58,022
Scott: Right.

345
00:23:58,523 --> 00:24:00,245
Scott: But that's not to me.

346
00:24:00,426 --> 00:24:02,389
Scott: That's not challenging to the audience.

347
00:24:02,569 --> 00:24:02,810
Scott: Right.

348
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:09,260
Scott: It's like because you're not asking any other questions, not asking questions about life or meaning or right.

349
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:16,994
Scott: It's like you don't walk out of there, you know, seeing those movies like, you know, like thinking like questioning existence.

350
00:24:17,094 --> 00:24:17,815
Scott: Right.

351
00:24:17,835 --> 00:24:18,296
Scott: Right.

352
00:24:18,677 --> 00:24:20,240
Scott: But you look at, you know, easy.

353
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,744
Scott: You know, we did it 2001 already as a book club.

354
00:24:22,804 --> 00:24:23,024
Scott: Right.

355
00:24:23,084 --> 00:24:24,847
Scott: It's like, what's the end of 2001?

356
00:24:24,847 --> 00:24:32,820
Scott: It's like, you know, you could like you could try to explain a little bit like, OK, so the aliens took him and kept him somewhere or something.

357
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,182
Rym: But something.

358
00:24:34,302 --> 00:24:34,502
Scott: Right.

359
00:24:34,703 --> 00:24:36,185
Scott: But it's like, what does it mean?

360
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:37,508
Scott: It's like it's challenge.

361
00:24:37,548 --> 00:24:40,212
Scott: It's not ask you what happened or what happens next.

362
00:24:40,292 --> 00:24:40,433
Scott: Right.

363
00:24:40,473 --> 00:24:41,354
Scott: It's challenging.

364
00:24:41,374 --> 00:24:42,076
Scott: Right.

365
00:24:42,336 --> 00:24:44,600
Scott: You're you're philosophically right.

366
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:49,192
Scott: You know what you believe about the short life that you are going to live on this earth.

367
00:24:49,413 --> 00:24:49,613
Scott: Right.

368
00:24:49,633 --> 00:24:50,877
Scott: And you have to answer it for yourself.

369
00:24:50,897 --> 00:24:52,120
Scott: They don't tell you what the answer is.

370
00:24:52,280 --> 00:25:01,780
Rym: And even to get back to Inception example, say you try to scratch the surface and dig deeper and ask questions, even if the movie or the work didn't necessarily compel you to.

371
00:25:02,421 --> 00:25:11,520
Rym: If you go deep on, say, Inception, you'll exhaust all your possibilities and lay out a fairly simple map of ideas and stories.

372
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:37,100
Rym: But even now, like thinking about this book and reading it, if you keep trying to line up allegories and like explain things, you can basically go infinitely deep because every angle asks more questions and ties back to other things you read and radically, diametrically opposed literary interpretations of parts of this book make perfect, consistent sense next to each other in the same story.

373
00:25:37,761 --> 00:25:37,921
Scott: Right.

374
00:25:37,962 --> 00:25:39,905
Scott: That is one thing right now.

375
00:25:39,945 --> 00:25:41,889
Scott: It's one thing to be so abstract.

376
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:42,511
Scott: Right.

377
00:25:42,551 --> 00:25:47,140
Scott: That it's like you put up like a Mondrian where it's like, I guess, Mondrian is still pretty good.

378
00:25:47,521 --> 00:25:48,202
Scott: I like him a lot.

379
00:25:48,222 --> 00:25:53,112
Scott: But it's like, you know, you put like a dot on you on a painting and it's like up to people to interpret the dot.

380
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:53,373
Scott: Right.

381
00:25:53,433 --> 00:25:56,419
Scott: It's like you barely you know, it's like it's so wide open.

382
00:25:56,439 --> 00:25:56,539
Scott: Right.

383
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:58,379
Scott: What did you really craft?

384
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:07,292
Rym: First, I do remember we were at the MoMA once and we were, you and me, this was years ago, and there was a big white wall and there was a little plaque at the bottom.

385
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:12,840
Rym: We walk over to it and the plaque said this wall was shot with a pellet on this date at this time.

386
00:26:13,261 --> 00:26:17,720
Rym: We stood there for a while looking at the wall, debating whether or not it was really shot and trying to find the bullet hole.

387
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:18,701
Scott: Sure.

388
00:26:20,002 --> 00:26:24,127
Scott: But, you know, think about like a Picasso, right, where it's still abstract.

389
00:26:24,507 --> 00:26:24,848
Scott: Right.

390
00:26:25,288 --> 00:26:27,291
Scott: But there is still so much there.

391
00:26:27,311 --> 00:26:28,352
Scott: Right.

392
00:26:28,612 --> 00:26:29,113
Scott: It's not like.

393
00:26:29,173 --> 00:26:33,778
Scott: they're just, you know, lazily making some open ended thing and being like, haha, it's challenging you.

394
00:26:34,078 --> 00:26:34,359
Scott: Right.

395
00:26:34,419 --> 00:26:35,400
Scott: It's like, no, it really is.

396
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,761
Rym: Well, it grounds you.

397
00:26:36,821 --> 00:26:56,940
Rym: The challenge and the literary discussion and the introspection are grounded in very specific literary notes, specific facts, specific framing to point you in a direction of inquiry instead of just having an open, like, you know, a completely open inquiry piece of art is almost not materially deeper than a zero inquiry art.

398
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:03,499
Rym: The magic is art that guides you into deep inquiry with the fewest pieces necessary to do so.

399
00:27:04,321 --> 00:27:07,886
Scott: And so we have this mysterious, you know, narrator.

400
00:27:08,347 --> 00:27:08,587
Scott: Right.

401
00:27:08,888 --> 00:27:10,250
Scott: Who they do.

402
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:16,980
Scott: You would almost any book, any book written today would at the end of the book reveal with no doubt who that narrator is.

403
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,163
Rym: And then Kaiser, so they walked away.

404
00:27:19,663 --> 00:27:21,085
Scott: I was 90 percent.

405
00:27:21,446 --> 00:27:23,929
Scott: I mean, you know, I was expecting right.

406
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:31,600
Scott: Half expecting, I guess, because like, you know, was that at the end of the book, that narrator was going to come in and close it off.

407
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:31,880
Scott: Right.

408
00:27:32,321 --> 00:27:36,167
Scott: And that narrator basically stops coming in like two thirds of the way through.

409
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:36,287
Scott: Yeah.

410
00:27:36,527 --> 00:27:36,688
Scott: Right.

411
00:27:36,708 --> 00:27:37,970
Scott: I mean, they're still narrating.

412
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:38,591
Scott: Right.

413
00:27:38,831 --> 00:27:44,340
Scott: But earlier in the book, there are times where the narrator breaks the fourth wall.

414
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,002
Rym: Oh, he's talking to you directly.

415
00:27:46,062 --> 00:27:46,643
Rym: And he's right.

416
00:27:46,843 --> 00:27:48,846
Scott: He basically talks about themselves.

417
00:27:49,147 --> 00:27:51,390
Rym: Where do you see what's about to fucking happen?

418
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,432
Rym: Like he's right.

419
00:27:52,512 --> 00:27:53,413
Scott: And that's the character.

420
00:27:53,433 --> 00:27:57,700
Scott: The narrator is the character who says it was me both times.

421
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,301
Scott: Yeah.

422
00:27:58,321 --> 00:27:58,581
Scott: Right.

423
00:27:58,922 --> 00:28:00,424
Scott: And there's another important scene.

424
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:07,536
Scott: The only time where the the narrator actually appears like in and meets was he meets Gabriel.

425
00:28:07,576 --> 00:28:07,697
Scott: Right.

426
00:28:07,717 --> 00:28:08,398
Scott: He's like on a better.

427
00:28:08,438 --> 00:28:09,680
Scott: So I forget the details.

428
00:28:09,961 --> 00:28:15,135
Scott: But Gabriel walks in a room and he's there and it might have been challenged to the walks in the room.

429
00:28:15,356 --> 00:28:16,980
Scott: One of the two characters walks into a room.

430
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:25,388
Rym: I want to point out that it is not that we're just forgetful because I know like, Scott, you have a reputation for forgetting the names of characters and I'm not great about it either.

431
00:28:25,568 --> 00:28:26,369
Rym: Like, to be fair.

432
00:28:26,489 --> 00:28:37,340
Rym: But in this case, the duality and the sort of flipping of roles is so integral to this book that it is very easy to forget which character did what because the book is doing that on purpose.

433
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,160
Scott: Right.

434
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:41,063
Scott: But anyway, one of the main characters, I should look up which one.

435
00:28:41,103 --> 00:28:41,524
Scott: It's important.

436
00:28:41,544 --> 00:28:43,646
Scott: Like one of the most important scenes, even though it's so short.

437
00:28:44,046 --> 00:28:44,206
Scott: Right.

438
00:28:44,266 --> 00:28:49,352
Scott: It's like such like this ridiculously significant, important scene in the book is like as like a page or two.

439
00:28:49,472 --> 00:28:49,792
Scott: Maybe.

440
00:28:49,952 --> 00:28:50,172
Scott: Right.

441
00:28:50,533 --> 00:28:52,114
Scott: They go in the room and the dude is there.

442
00:28:52,335 --> 00:28:53,195
Scott: who's the narrator.

443
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:53,776
Scott: Clearly.

444
00:28:53,796 --> 00:28:54,377
Scott: Right.

445
00:28:54,697 --> 00:28:57,219
Scott: You could just tell somehow with even though it didn't say so.

446
00:28:57,239 --> 00:28:57,740
Scott: Right.

447
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:05,145
Scott: And he's like the narrator is trying to like, you know, tell whoever it is, you know, something.

448
00:29:05,406 --> 00:29:05,706
Scott: Right.

449
00:29:06,006 --> 00:29:07,027
Scott: It's like influence them.

450
00:29:07,528 --> 00:29:08,849
Scott: And he's being challenged.

451
00:29:08,889 --> 00:29:12,171
Scott: He's basically being asked, like, are you are you God or are you Satan?

452
00:29:12,412 --> 00:29:12,712
Scott: Right.

453
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:14,373
Scott: It's like the character knows.

454
00:29:14,814 --> 00:29:16,135
Scott: He's like, which one are you?

455
00:29:16,455 --> 00:29:19,317
Scott: And he's just sort of like laughs at him.

456
00:29:19,378 --> 00:29:19,578
Scott: Right.

457
00:29:19,618 --> 00:29:22,260
Scott: It's like, well, you don't know which one I am, bro.

458
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,401
Rym: So right.

459
00:29:25,081 --> 00:29:33,267
Scott: And my interpretation, my friend is another part where the narrator comes back and talks to the reader and is like, well, that did do didn't know which one I was.

460
00:29:33,868 --> 00:29:38,411
Scott: If I was if I was one of them at all to be, you know, either one, I could have been something, you know, that's right.

461
00:29:38,951 --> 00:29:50,620
Rym: It's like, and knowing that this book is partly widely interpreted to be an interrogation of salmon, Russia's own life and struggles with living between cultures.

462
00:29:51,261 --> 00:30:00,051
Rym: I'd say that two strong interpretations are that, well, three, if you want to go a fully mystical route, interpretation number one, it is God, but God isn't good or evil.

463
00:30:00,251 --> 00:30:02,253
Rym: And it's a coin flipping in the wind.

464
00:30:02,413 --> 00:30:04,796
Rym: Like both of them are God and Satan at the same time.

465
00:30:04,896 --> 00:30:06,658
Scott: Actual Angel Gabriel works, too.

466
00:30:06,678 --> 00:30:07,259
Scott: Right.

467
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:08,380
Scott: Satan works.

468
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:15,948
Rym: I think a compelling one is that that is a stand in for the concept of human consciousness.

469
00:30:16,569 --> 00:30:17,269
Rym: All humans.

470
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:19,031
Rym: But I want to really elaborate on it.

471
00:30:19,632 --> 00:30:20,933
Rym: All humans have this sort of.

472
00:30:22,034 --> 00:30:27,440
Rym: what our consciousness is, is something that we can only interrogate through ourselves.

473
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:31,524
Rym: And I think this work explores that very well, because it is very much.

474
00:30:32,285 --> 00:30:45,560
Rym: there's a common thread of characters asking themselves questions and making decisions or often doing something with no introspection, like when some murders happen and there's a bunch of scenes along the way.

475
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:53,047
Rym: Or even in the beginning, when Gabriel just doesn't do anything, which I'm just getting arrested, he doesn't think about not doing anything.

476
00:30:53,948 --> 00:30:56,490
Rym: The act almost happens like it was predetermined.

477
00:30:56,971 --> 00:31:07,080
Rym: And then he starts talking to himself or becoming the angel or something, almost just to rationalize and explain why he did what he did.

478
00:31:08,341 --> 00:31:11,467
Rym: Which is a lot that meant pretty well to how human consciousness works.

479
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:14,653
Rym: And it would fit the idea that my hound was.

480
00:31:14,753 --> 00:31:15,775
Rym: it was my hound all along.

481
00:31:15,855 --> 00:31:18,520
Rym: Every character is themself all along.

482
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:24,059
Scott: And we know we know for a fact that baseball players swing the bat before they can see.

483
00:31:24,099 --> 00:31:24,300
Scott: Right.

484
00:31:25,501 --> 00:31:38,980
Rym: And thus, that character is the innate consciousness that is inside of all humans, because we're all interrogating and interpreting the world through the same flawed shared lens.

485
00:31:39,661 --> 00:31:47,933
Rym: But a third interpretation, and I was poking around, the third one that I got a hundred for is that that is Sam and Rushdie himself.

486
00:31:48,654 --> 00:31:49,094
Scott: Could be.

487
00:31:49,515 --> 00:31:50,016
Scott: That's a good one.

488
00:31:50,056 --> 00:31:52,940
Rym: Who is God, if in terms of writing the book.

489
00:31:54,501 --> 00:32:00,417
Rym: And based on what I've read about Sam and Rushdie, that really does feel like the kind of thing he would have done, but would never admit to.

490
00:32:00,738 --> 00:32:01,340
Scott: So maybe.

491
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,102
Scott: All right.

492
00:32:02,142 --> 00:32:05,169
Scott: So we got to talk about the title of the books, the satanic verses.

493
00:32:05,229 --> 00:32:05,430
Scott: Right.

494
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,234
Scott: So it's like, what the hell are the satanic verses?

495
00:32:07,434 --> 00:32:09,700
Scott: I didn't know this until I read the book and I looked it up.

496
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:14,848
Rym: And it's almost every religion that has a book has a concept of these apocryphal.

497
00:32:15,569 --> 00:32:15,870
Scott: Sure.

498
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:16,310
Scott: Right.

499
00:32:16,611 --> 00:32:17,633
Scott: So here's the deal.

500
00:32:18,574 --> 00:32:19,736
Scott: Forget the book for a second.

501
00:32:19,936 --> 00:32:20,177
Scott: Right.

502
00:32:20,377 --> 00:32:21,459
Scott: In Earth.

503
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:22,040
Scott: Right.

504
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:23,480
Scott: Supposedly.

505
00:32:23,881 --> 00:32:24,141
Scott: Right.

506
00:32:24,882 --> 00:32:31,511
Scott: Mohammed went to Mecca, the place geographically with his with his clan of tribe of peoples.

507
00:32:31,872 --> 00:32:32,112
Scott: Right.

508
00:32:32,192 --> 00:32:33,774
Scott: The earliest Islamic peoples.

509
00:32:34,395 --> 00:32:36,558
Scott: And in Mecca, there were these other tribes there, too.

510
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:37,580
Scott: They were already there.

511
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:38,320
Scott: Right.

512
00:32:39,802 --> 00:32:42,145
Scott: And those other tribes had other gods.

513
00:32:42,185 --> 00:32:43,006
Scott: They were worshipping.

514
00:32:43,206 --> 00:32:43,406
Scott: Right.

515
00:32:43,506 --> 00:32:44,027
Scott: What were their names?

516
00:32:44,047 --> 00:32:44,287
Scott: There were.

517
00:32:44,327 --> 00:32:47,130
Scott: there were a lot of like, you know, female gods or goddesses.

518
00:32:47,951 --> 00:32:48,191
Scott: Right.

519
00:32:48,932 --> 00:32:55,219
Scott: And basically, like they at first they were kind of chill with Mohammed's people coming to live there.

520
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:55,940
Scott: Right.

521
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,544
Scott: Until Mohammed was like, no, no, no, no, no.

522
00:32:59,564 --> 00:33:01,147
Scott: We got to do some monotheism here.

523
00:33:01,227 --> 00:33:02,389
Scott: Get these other gods out of here.

524
00:33:02,669 --> 00:33:02,929
Scott: Right.

525
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:04,933
Scott: And then they're like, get out of here, bro.

526
00:33:05,153 --> 00:33:05,353
Scott: Right.

527
00:33:05,373 --> 00:33:07,957
Scott: We were cool with the polytheism.

528
00:33:08,017 --> 00:33:09,159
Scott: Everyone doing their own thing.

529
00:33:09,179 --> 00:33:09,740
Scott: Right.

530
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:15,969
Scott: But we're not cool with you trying to, you know, eliminate our existing traditions in this area.

531
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:16,410
Scott: Right.

532
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:19,275
Scott: And to make, you know, our people.

533
00:33:19,435 --> 00:33:19,635
Scott: Right.

534
00:33:19,675 --> 00:33:20,717
Scott: Become your way.

535
00:33:20,797 --> 00:33:20,957
Scott: Right.

536
00:33:20,977 --> 00:33:22,280
Scott: Go go live over there instead.

537
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:22,420
Scott: Right.

538
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:34,252
Rym: And then you've got the pragmatic rulers of this place being like, look, say these these other gods are also cool and we're cool with you and everything will be fine.

539
00:33:34,573 --> 00:33:35,914
Rym: And he's like, you know what?

540
00:33:36,355 --> 00:33:38,077
Rym: Yeah, this will work out.

541
00:33:38,137 --> 00:33:41,060
Rym: And then immediately he's like, oh, no, no, that's not going to work.

542
00:33:41,881 --> 00:33:42,001
Scott: Yeah.

543
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:42,762
Scott: It changes his mind.

544
00:33:42,822 --> 00:33:42,962
Scott: Right.

545
00:33:43,002 --> 00:33:46,626
Scott: So basically and then in the book.

546
00:33:47,107 --> 00:33:47,247
Scott: Right.

547
00:33:47,267 --> 00:33:51,191
Scott: You have these dreams that Gabriel is having of Jhilia.

548
00:33:51,632 --> 00:33:53,954
Scott: And it's basically that story retold.

549
00:33:54,355 --> 00:33:54,615
Scott: Right.

550
00:33:55,015 --> 00:33:57,438
Scott: It's you know, with my hound instead of Mohammed.

551
00:33:57,819 --> 00:33:58,119
Scott: Right.

552
00:33:58,499 --> 00:33:59,040
Scott: And whatnot.

553
00:33:59,861 --> 00:34:06,465
Scott: And basically, you know, what happens is, you know, Islam begins to take over everywhere except Jhilia slash Mecca.

554
00:34:06,906 --> 00:34:07,166
Scott: Right.

555
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:08,667
Scott: Until it's like surrounding.

556
00:34:09,127 --> 00:34:10,467
Scott: And then Mohammed comes back.

557
00:34:11,109 --> 00:34:11,389
Scott: Right.

558
00:34:11,789 --> 00:34:26,860
Rym: And defeats the gods that are or sentences do to go defeat the gods that are and there's a whole undercurrent there of the nature of how movements that are oppressed tend to spread partly because of that oppression.

559
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:34,308
Rym: And that comes up both in the beginning and toward the end with all the riots and the trumpet and the fire and all that other stuff like that.

560
00:34:34,688 --> 00:34:35,630
Rym: That is a thread.

561
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:45,080
Rym: And it definitely seems to follow sort of the history of like how religions have spread in the real world.

562
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:49,683
Scott: But so anyway, the thing I want to focus on, though, are these satanic verses.

563
00:34:49,783 --> 00:34:58,870
Scott: is that, you know, Mohammed receives right instructions from, you know, or my hound receives instructions from the angel Gabriel or himself or whatever.

564
00:34:58,970 --> 00:34:59,390
Rym: Right.

565
00:34:59,430 --> 00:34:59,950
Scott: And so he's like.

566
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:00,971
Scott: he's like, what should I do?

567
00:35:01,091 --> 00:35:05,314
Scott: And at first, you know, the narrator right is the one delivering the messages.

568
00:35:05,615 --> 00:35:05,835
Scott: Right.

569
00:35:06,115 --> 00:35:12,800
Scott: So even if the narrator isn't the angel Gabriel, they are still acting the part and delivering the messages to my hound.

570
00:35:13,481 --> 00:35:19,345
Scott: And at first tells him, you know, except, right, the other lady gods.

571
00:35:19,585 --> 00:35:19,846
Scott: Right.

572
00:35:20,186 --> 00:35:22,428
Scott: And then and then comes back the second time.

573
00:35:22,508 --> 00:35:25,951
Scott: It was him both times and says, no, no, no monotheism.

574
00:35:25,971 --> 00:35:26,992
Scott: There's only one God get.

575
00:35:27,252 --> 00:35:28,713
Scott: Allah is the is the only one.

576
00:35:28,733 --> 00:35:29,474
Scott: Get them out of here.

577
00:35:29,674 --> 00:35:29,874
Scott: Right.

578
00:35:30,534 --> 00:35:34,818
Scott: And so and, you know, my hound goes at the second.

579
00:35:35,278 --> 00:35:37,180
Scott: He just the hound decides on his own.

580
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:37,660
Scott: Right.

581
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,844
Scott: The second verse is the must have been actually the real Gabriel.

582
00:35:42,364 --> 00:35:44,546
Scott: And the first one was Satan.

583
00:35:44,766 --> 00:35:45,066
Scott: Right.

584
00:35:45,247 --> 00:35:48,209
Scott: Was was lying to him and telling him to accept those pagan gods.

585
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:50,391
Scott: Here's the thing.

586
00:35:50,411 --> 00:36:00,579
Scott: I think the key of one of like, you know, maybe the second most central focus of the book is that those pagan gods happen to all be goddesses.

587
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:01,220
Scott: Right.

588
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,741
Scott: That were all the three of them.

589
00:36:02,781 --> 00:36:04,142
Scott: I think there were three goddesses.

590
00:36:04,223 --> 00:36:07,866
Rym: The hound makes a really good point early in the book.

591
00:36:08,346 --> 00:36:12,330
Rym: And that theme comes up later because sexism is addressed in these books as well.

592
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,351
Rym: Pretty directly how.

593
00:36:14,892 --> 00:36:16,833
Rym: Oh, so we have a bunch of female goddesses.

594
00:36:17,134 --> 00:36:19,556
Rym: Goddesses have power, but women don't.

595
00:36:20,036 --> 00:36:24,600
Rym: And now you want to have a god who takes away even that last power that women have from our society.

596
00:36:25,481 --> 00:36:25,681
Scott: Yep.

597
00:36:26,061 --> 00:36:26,241
Scott: Yep.

598
00:36:26,281 --> 00:36:26,461
Scott: Yep.

599
00:36:26,622 --> 00:36:27,142
Scott: Exactly.

600
00:36:27,402 --> 00:36:27,622
Scott: Right.

601
00:36:27,862 --> 00:36:32,106
Scott: And so the satanic verses were the the pro women versus.

602
00:36:32,866 --> 00:36:33,166
Scott: Right.

603
00:36:33,727 --> 00:36:35,268
Scott: And then you can see.

604
00:36:35,288 --> 00:36:36,189
Scott: Right.

605
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:41,112
Scott: The way it's a commentary, obviously, on the way Islam treats women, which is just obvious.

606
00:36:41,753 --> 00:36:42,413
Scott: to get into that.

607
00:36:42,594 --> 00:36:43,734
Scott: Right.

608
00:36:43,854 --> 00:36:44,835
Rym: As much as well.

609
00:36:45,456 --> 00:36:45,696
Scott: Yeah.

610
00:36:46,116 --> 00:36:49,539
Scott: But then look at the other characters who are in line.

611
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:50,239
Scott: Right.

612
00:36:50,299 --> 00:36:50,960
Scott: With my hound.

613
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,381
Scott: Gabriel, most of all.

614
00:36:53,681 --> 00:36:53,921
Scott: Right.

615
00:36:54,282 --> 00:36:56,643
Scott: And the way he treats women in his life.

616
00:36:56,703 --> 00:37:03,228
Scott: The story starts with, like, a married woman that he cheated with and then left behind jumping off a building and killing her.

617
00:37:03,268 --> 00:37:04,669
Rym: Yeah, that happens right away.

618
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:05,870
Scott: Right.

619
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:10,133
Scott: You know, he's got the girl who comes.

620
00:37:11,154 --> 00:37:17,598
Rym: One thing we haven't mentioned, if you haven't read the book and you're just listening to this, the book is laugh out loud funny sometimes.

621
00:37:18,199 --> 00:37:19,700
Rym: And this is very much intentional.

622
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,241
Rym: And a lot of people speak to its humor.

623
00:37:21,541 --> 00:37:25,944
Rym: But she she likes splats and there's a whole thing about the splat.

624
00:37:27,325 --> 00:37:27,505
Scott: Yep.

625
00:37:29,287 --> 00:37:35,451
Scott: And then when she comes back, like on a flying carpet, like, yeah, as a ghost messing with an echo.

626
00:37:35,551 --> 00:37:37,572
Rym: But also, yeah, there's there's that whole.

627
00:37:37,592 --> 00:37:39,374
Rym: I don't remember much because that happens pretty early.

628
00:37:39,394 --> 00:37:40,554
Rym: So I don't remember much about it.

629
00:37:40,594 --> 00:37:41,715
Scott: She comes back a few times.

630
00:37:41,815 --> 00:37:44,057
Rym: Yeah, but they're short, really short scenes.

631
00:37:44,997 --> 00:37:45,158
Scott: Right.

632
00:37:45,498 --> 00:37:48,480
Scott: And then when he's in London, there's the the mountaineer alley.

633
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,020
Scott: Right.

634
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:50,921
Scott: Hallelujah.

635
00:37:51,121 --> 00:37:51,501
Rym: The name.

636
00:37:51,521 --> 00:37:53,523
Rym: we haven't talked about all the names yet.

637
00:37:53,663 --> 00:37:55,004
Rym: Beyond the few we mentioned.

638
00:37:55,404 --> 00:37:58,686
Scott: Hallelujah Cone, the mountaineer who can climb who climbed Everest.

639
00:37:58,886 --> 00:37:59,567
Scott: Yeah, everything.

640
00:38:00,047 --> 00:38:00,327
Scott: Right.

641
00:38:00,648 --> 00:38:03,570
Scott: You know, it's like he's mistreating her real bad, too.

642
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:04,530
Scott: Right.

643
00:38:06,231 --> 00:38:08,173
Scott: Yeah.

644
00:38:08,313 --> 00:38:08,713
Scott: And then.

645
00:38:09,213 --> 00:38:09,474
Scott: Right.

646
00:38:09,514 --> 00:38:10,654
Scott: You got the.

647
00:38:10,674 --> 00:38:13,857
Scott: there's actually one of the Aisha's.

648
00:38:14,357 --> 00:38:14,597
Scott: Right.

649
00:38:14,777 --> 00:38:18,200
Scott: The one who is, you know, the butterfly one.

650
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:18,820
Scott: Right.

651
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,082
Scott: Like, ah, she is a woman.

652
00:38:21,502 --> 00:38:21,722
Scott: Right.

653
00:38:21,843 --> 00:38:25,345
Scott: Receiving these prophecies or whatever, supposedly.

654
00:38:25,826 --> 00:38:26,106
Scott: Right.

655
00:38:27,327 --> 00:38:30,189
Scott: And you get you have all this, you know, it's all lining up in that way.

656
00:38:30,269 --> 00:38:35,694
Scott: And then the biggest one is there's the Aisha who is the prostitute.

657
00:38:36,034 --> 00:38:36,274
Scott: Right.

658
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,475
Scott: The 15 year old one.

659
00:38:38,076 --> 00:38:38,336
Scott: Right.

660
00:38:38,676 --> 00:38:42,940
Scott: Which is basically my hounds wife is right.

661
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,622
Scott: My hounds, I guess, favorite wife is Aisha.

662
00:38:45,822 --> 00:38:46,002
Scott: Right.

663
00:38:46,022 --> 00:38:47,183
Scott: And you don't really hear from her.

664
00:38:47,203 --> 00:38:50,425
Scott: You just sort of know that my hounds has a wife who's the favorite one.

665
00:38:50,465 --> 00:38:51,866
Scott: And her name is Aisha.

666
00:38:52,527 --> 00:38:59,011
Scott: And then there's the whole part where the the prostitutes are like the last holdouts in the area.

667
00:38:59,151 --> 00:39:04,095
Rym: And she names herself basically the same name as my hounds beautiful wife.

668
00:39:04,435 --> 00:39:07,057
Rym: And you can read into what why that might have happened.

669
00:39:07,477 --> 00:39:08,178
Rym: And you see that a lot.

670
00:39:08,198 --> 00:39:09,679
Rym: There's a lot of not the.

671
00:39:09,779 --> 00:39:11,280
Scott: the blog is a ball.

672
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,501
Scott: But he's like the.

673
00:39:13,822 --> 00:39:16,484
Scott: I guess he's the the Chamcha equivalent.

674
00:39:16,804 --> 00:39:17,144
Rym: Yeah.

675
00:39:17,704 --> 00:39:20,626
Scott: It's sort of like, you know, the the the truth.

676
00:39:20,887 --> 00:39:24,789
Scott: Yeller speaker guy who's he's basically hiding out right in the.

677
00:39:24,949 --> 00:39:25,109
Rym: Yeah.

678
00:39:25,169 --> 00:39:27,651
Scott: And that's where we get all the to be a eunuch.

679
00:39:27,851 --> 00:39:28,131
Scott: Right.

680
00:39:28,151 --> 00:39:31,013
Scott: And he's hiding out in the in the prostitute area.

681
00:39:31,434 --> 00:39:35,036
Rym: But all a lot of the names are very like.

682
00:39:35,557 --> 00:39:40,660
Rym: the names themselves mean something and are pointed, not just tying characters together by having the same names.

683
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:50,847
Rym: But like the fact that basically the street rapper who the the sultan basically hires to dis Islam is named the ball.

684
00:39:50,867 --> 00:39:52,328
Scott: Mm hmm.

685
00:39:52,388 --> 00:39:52,948
Scott: Mm hmm.

686
00:39:54,029 --> 00:39:54,930
Rym: And I think, oh, yeah, right.

687
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:58,972
Rym: And in the end of the book, when he's got the flame trumpet, he names that as real.

688
00:40:00,453 --> 00:40:01,834
Scott: Oh, yeah.

689
00:40:01,854 --> 00:40:02,235
Rym: Yeah.

690
00:40:02,295 --> 00:40:02,535
Rym: Yeah.

691
00:40:02,555 --> 00:40:04,816
Rym: I was probably the trumpet part stood out like, wait a minute.

692
00:40:05,617 --> 00:40:06,157
Rym: Wait a minute.

693
00:40:06,578 --> 00:40:10,140
Rym: As soon as he was like, I see flame come out of the trumpet, I was like, that's going to be Chekhov.

694
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,241
Scott: I forgot about the trumpets.

695
00:40:11,282 --> 00:40:11,983
Scott: That's good.

696
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:13,545
Rym: That's going to be a real play.

697
00:40:13,565 --> 00:40:14,907
Rym: That's basically a flamethrower.

698
00:40:14,967 --> 00:40:23,198
Rym: That's a. that's also a metaphor for speaking words that cause Molotov to get thrown means you might as well have just thrown the Molotov.

699
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:24,220
Scott: Yep.

700
00:40:26,242 --> 00:40:26,563
Scott: All right.

701
00:40:26,584 --> 00:40:29,860
Scott: So what are the parts of this book you talk about?

702
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,107
Scott: I mean, I guess the magic lamp.

703
00:40:32,208 --> 00:40:32,449
Scott: Right.

704
00:40:32,509 --> 00:40:34,960
Scott: So at the very beginning, Chekhov's magic lamp.

705
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:35,421
Scott: Yep.

706
00:40:35,743 --> 00:40:40,480
Rym: And when his dad is like, there's the whole because that is that is Chomsha's dad.

707
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:40,760
Scott: Right.

708
00:40:40,781 --> 00:40:44,900
Scott: So Gabriel's family, you hear about early in the book, but then basically they're gone.

709
00:40:44,981 --> 00:40:45,123
Scott: Right.

710
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:46,500
Scott: It's just sort of giving you his background.

711
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:46,801
Rym: Yeah.

712
00:40:47,022 --> 00:40:50,700
Scott: Whereas Chomsha's dad is like a significant character.

713
00:40:51,101 --> 00:40:51,382
Scott: Right.

714
00:40:51,863 --> 00:40:56,400
Scott: Where, you know, he has like this weird relationship with the with the walnut tree.

715
00:40:56,862 --> 00:40:57,145
Scott: Right.

716
00:40:57,185 --> 00:40:58,580
Scott: And everything was in his dad.

717
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:18,898
Rym: There's definitely because if we if we look at this through the lens of more an immigrant story and people who are transitioning between two cultures or caught between two cultures like that, which is the one of the primary and most important allegories of this work, to be clear, it is definitely his dad is a mixed bag.

718
00:41:18,958 --> 00:41:21,660
Rym: because on one hand, his dad is outright abusive in some ways.

719
00:41:22,241 --> 00:41:29,378
Rym: But on the other hand, his dad is not wrong that the choices he's making to fetishize London are not going to end.

720
00:41:29,398 --> 00:41:29,920
Rym: well for him.

721
00:41:32,061 --> 00:41:39,500
Rym: But that magic lamp, the whole as soon as you learn that dad won't let him touch the magic lamp until he's older.

722
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:41,679
Rym: And and I was like, that lamp's coming back.

723
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:42,863
Rym: That's Chekhov's lamp.

724
00:41:43,264 --> 00:41:48,700
Rym: And then it comes back as, well, because of the decisions you made, I'm never going to let you have this lamp.

725
00:41:49,101 --> 00:41:54,280
Rym: And then it literally is Chekhov's lamp, because that's literally the gun that Gabriel uses to kill himself.

726
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:58,366
Rym: Yeah, that was just.

727
00:41:58,447 --> 00:42:04,720
Rym: I did not expect the lamp to come back in that specific manner, because that opens up.

728
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:17,780
Rym: You could do a whole podcast just talking about the metaphor of the lamp, because think about from Chomps's perspective as a naive kid in India who has dreams of going to London and leaving his what he is.

729
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:25,760
Rym: Wrongly, and like he considers his home native culture to be bad in some way for a lot of reasons that we could interrogate.

730
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,900
Rym: And he wants to leave it behind.

731
00:42:28,323 --> 00:42:29,700
Rym: And the magic lamp is always free.

732
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:34,920
Scott: It's a lot like those people who aren't white, who, you know, I'm not saying that Chomps is like white supremacist bad levels.

733
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:35,601
Rym: Right.

734
00:42:35,621 --> 00:42:37,320
Rym: But he definitely elevates.

735
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:41,720
Scott: There are a lot of people who are not white who become white supremacists.

736
00:42:41,982 --> 00:42:42,284
Scott: Right.

737
00:42:42,365 --> 00:42:44,119
Scott: It's like, you know, they end up believing.

738
00:42:44,482 --> 00:42:47,679
Scott: And, you know, there's a lot of misogynist women out there.

739
00:42:47,921 --> 00:42:48,266
Scott: Right.

740
00:42:48,731 --> 00:42:49,359
Scott: You know, yeah.

741
00:42:50,141 --> 00:42:53,620
Scott: And there's a woman who's saying I belong in the kitchen as a baby factory.

742
00:42:53,701 --> 00:42:54,776
Scott: Like there are people like that.

743
00:42:54,857 --> 00:42:55,060
Scott: Right.

744
00:42:55,160 --> 00:43:03,760
Scott: And that's sort of, you know, Chomps is not at that level because but he is sort of like, you know, London is out there colonized.

745
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:06,120
Scott: You know, UK is out there colonizing India.

746
00:43:06,481 --> 00:43:06,803
Scott: Right.

747
00:43:07,065 --> 00:43:09,540
Scott: And he's Indian and he's like, go London.

748
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,426
Scott: Yeah, colonize.

749
00:43:10,567 --> 00:43:11,372
Rym: He's like my.

750
00:43:11,413 --> 00:43:12,520
Rym: where I live sucks.

751
00:43:12,662 --> 00:43:14,160
Rym: And they were right to colonize us.

752
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:14,963
Rym: And then he gets there.

753
00:43:15,003 --> 00:43:18,639
Rym: And of course, he's not accepted the way that he wants to be.

754
00:43:19,142 --> 00:43:21,899
Rym: I mean, we see how the police treat him and it only goes downhill from there.

755
00:43:22,521 --> 00:43:29,158
Rym: But then he goes back to Bombay and he doesn't fit in there anymore either, even if he wants to.

756
00:43:31,344 --> 00:43:35,040
Rym: And I think that is a very common and important story.

757
00:43:35,181 --> 00:43:37,020
Rym: And that's a lot of what this book is about.

758
00:43:37,461 --> 00:43:42,320
Rym: Even if you strip away all the magic and everything else that's going on, it's ultimately about that.

759
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:56,020
Rym: It's about the the insidious and pernicious nature of white supremacy and colonialism and how it almost converts people from colonized cultures to its cause.

760
00:43:56,501 --> 00:44:10,860
Rym: But we'll never actually reward them in the same way that the magic lamp represented all of his dreams of what it would be like if you got to London and became a Londoner and like join what he perceived as the modern enlightened world.

761
00:44:11,262 --> 00:44:14,140
Rym: And in the end, the lamp is just an avenue for suicide.

762
00:44:16,342 --> 00:44:19,959
Rym: But it's very notable that it is not him who even uses the lamp in the end.

763
00:44:21,142 --> 00:44:21,303
Scott: No.

764
00:44:22,529 --> 00:44:24,399
Scott: All right.

765
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:30,160
Scott: I mean, we could go on for a very long time, probably for days and days.

766
00:44:31,242 --> 00:44:34,919
Scott: Is there anything else that's so significant, though, that we really want to mention it?

767
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,805
Rym: You know, I did like like.

768
00:44:36,865 --> 00:44:40,620
Rym: it stuck with me one of the early short segments, the Argentinian story.

769
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:47,839
Rym: Because it was told a little bit differently from the others, because it was, you know, the the woman, what, Diamond?

770
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,919
Rym: Was that their name, like Rosa Diamond?

771
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:51,660
Scott: I barely remember it, this part.

772
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:52,690
Scott: I do remember it.

773
00:44:52,791 --> 00:44:53,439
Scott: That exists.

774
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:54,161
Scott: Right.

775
00:44:54,181 --> 00:44:57,060
Rym: And I wasn't super clear as I was reading it on what happened.

776
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:58,226
Scott: He was it was basically.

777
00:44:58,246 --> 00:45:00,600
Scott: I think it was, you know, your meta knowledge.

778
00:45:00,741 --> 00:45:00,882
Scott: Right.

779
00:45:00,902 --> 00:45:03,020
Scott: He was commenting on the, you know, the war.

780
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:03,961
Rym: Well, the war.

781
00:45:04,222 --> 00:45:18,960
Rym: The fact that a bunch of Nazis did move to Argentina because like but also how like you have even colonizers who move to the place and almost do the reverse, like they appropriate and adopt the culture.

782
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:42,679
Rym: Like you've got the English people coming to Argentina and basically cosplaying as Argentinians and cosplaying their warped perception of Argentinian machismo and masculine honor and how when the murder happens and the nonsense goes down, all the Argentinians are like, listen, you fucking English people, if you just leave now, we won't like bring you to our courts and prosecute you.

783
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:43,601
Rym: Like it was.

784
00:45:44,022 --> 00:45:54,800
Rym: there's a really important other side of the story of colonialism that sort of really inspects the idea that it never works out in either direction.

785
00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:02,680
Rym: The appropriation and the infiltration is just as dangerous and toxic as the expropriation and exfiltration.

786
00:46:03,801 --> 00:46:05,299
Scott: I mean, I mean, I said war.

787
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:06,719
Scott: I was talking about the Falken Islands war.

788
00:46:07,422 --> 00:46:09,458
Rym: Oh, he's basically a weeb about...

789
00:46:09,901 --> 00:46:14,140
Scott: Which keep in mind, the Falken Islands was not long before this book was published.

790
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:15,407
Scott: Yeah, right.

791
00:46:15,488 --> 00:46:17,139
Scott: It was really close time frame wise.

792
00:46:18,762 --> 00:46:22,320
Rym: And there's a whole extra historical context about that war they won't have time to get into.

793
00:46:22,921 --> 00:46:30,039
Scott: But it sort of felt like, though, like he's got this whole book to work with and it's like that wasn't anywhere close to the main point of the book.

794
00:46:30,421 --> 00:46:30,601
Scott: Right.

795
00:46:30,922 --> 00:46:39,279
Scott: But he just sort of had space to like, you know, and was managed to fit in, you know, comments on other things that were just going on.

796
00:46:39,521 --> 00:46:40,245
Scott: Well, it's like, oh, yeah.

797
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:47,700
Rym: And he, you know, he brought he was brought with him from England, his new ideas from Germany.

798
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:52,359
Rym: And then you get a very abstract description of what is obviously a Nazi flag, followed by the.

799
00:46:53,623 --> 00:46:56,113
Rym: the wife has her affair on the island.

800
00:46:56,474 --> 00:46:58,000
Rym: that is all white for some reason.

801
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:59,064
Rym: And there's no color there.

802
00:46:59,124 --> 00:47:05,480
Rym: And everything's just white except for the red of the blood from the murder and the red from the Nazi flag.

803
00:47:06,142 --> 00:47:12,560
Rym: And that is almost Sam and Rashi just hitting you over the head like, yeah, that's where all of this leads ultimately.

804
00:47:15,662 --> 00:47:19,040
Rym: So, yeah, this like since we probably shouldn't go on forever.

805
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:21,200
Scott: Oh, we should talk about the pilgrimage deal.

806
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:21,982
Scott: That's the.

807
00:47:22,042 --> 00:47:24,730
Rym: oh, yeah, because that that's a whole other thing around.

808
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:31,460
Rym: the people make their own myths and it doesn't matter the truth of an event like that.

809
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:32,738
Rym: Like, let's say that literally happened.

810
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:42,359
Rym: Faithful people would very likely say, and all the pilgrims made it to the other side and survived, even though that is obviously not what happened.

811
00:47:44,525 --> 00:47:46,280
Scott: Or they did, but it was in the afterlife.

812
00:47:48,182 --> 00:47:51,720
Rym: Which, you know, actually, that makes me think that gets back to the whole concept of the magic lamp.

813
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:56,399
Rym: What's your reward for doing what white colonial culture wants you to do?

814
00:47:56,860 --> 00:48:01,520
Rym: Well, you're going to die because your reward is in an afterlife and the afterlife doesn't exist.

815
00:48:03,421 --> 00:48:04,244
Scott: But, yeah, so there's this.

816
00:48:04,826 --> 00:48:08,340
Scott: one of the Aishas, right, is like this is poor town in India.

817
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:08,756
Scott: Yeah.

818
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:12,120
Scott: And it's because or is it India?

819
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,220
Scott: It's no, I couldn't.

820
00:48:14,501 --> 00:48:15,900
Rym: I was not clear on that.

821
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:18,379
Rym: All I was and I wasn't even clear on when it was set right away.

822
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:23,240
Scott: All I couldn't figure out the geography, but clearly they had to cross the water to get to Mecca.

823
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:34,780
Rym: But she basically performed almost like an accidental miracle, like she detected the breast cancer, like she had an almost like a sort of miracle and people were kind of on board with her.

824
00:48:35,541 --> 00:48:39,960
Rym: And then through plausible things that happen, people start to follow her.

825
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:43,300
Rym: Obviously, I'm skipping over the detail because I don't remember that part of the book super well.

826
00:48:43,741 --> 00:48:48,680
Scott: I focused on other parts, but it's weird because like it's one it's like a thread they go back to.

827
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,340
Scott: But there's like a large gap where they don't go back to it.

828
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:52,156
Scott: Yeah, it's like it's there.

829
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:54,940
Scott: They it goes away from it for a long time.

830
00:48:55,061 --> 00:48:58,459
Scott: And then towards the end of the book goes back to it until it wraps up.

831
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:04,702
Scott: Yeah, but so it's not like a lot of books were like, I guess, sort of evenly like, you know, Prince of Nothing.

832
00:49:04,742 --> 00:49:05,626
Scott: Good example of like.

833
00:49:05,647 --> 00:49:11,700
Scott: you got three different things going on and they go one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three.

834
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:18,342
Scott: This book is just like one, five, one, one, one, two, three, four, seven, one, two, five, three.

835
00:49:18,382 --> 00:49:18,522
Scott: Right.

836
00:49:18,863 --> 00:49:29,041
Scott: Just there's no like set pattern of like going back and forth between the different, you know, and now it's a dream and now it's Chamcha again and now it's, you know, whatever.

837
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:36,508
Rym: But it's definitely that feels like because the Imam story, like the one making it a Khomeini, they both.

838
00:49:36,628 --> 00:49:41,279
Rym: definitely it's almost like an escalation because people follow Mahound and things happen.

839
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:49,123
Rym: People follow Aisha to their just straight up deaths and people follow the Imam to his ulterior motives.

840
00:49:49,584 --> 00:49:58,100
Rym: And there's definitely a very clear critique of blind faith in extremism leads to death and misery and ruin.

841
00:49:58,682 --> 00:50:05,140
Rym: And that is very prominently and explicitly portrayed over and over and over again.

842
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:10,380
Rym: Even Chamcha blindly following his idealized internal vision of England leads to ruin.

843
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:22,120
Scott: But I think the thing that I focused on in the pilgrimage part, right, where this cast of characters that was following pilgrimage, right, and what each one sort of represented.

844
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:22,441
Scott: Right.

845
00:50:22,461 --> 00:50:26,840
Scott: So it was the guy driving the car who was trying to convince them to stop.

846
00:50:26,981 --> 00:50:28,199
Scott: Yeah, not go.

847
00:50:28,901 --> 00:50:29,122
Scott: Right.

848
00:50:29,383 --> 00:50:34,124
Scott: You had like the people who still believed, but they couldn't manage to walk that far.

849
00:50:34,206 --> 00:50:34,999
Scott: They got in the car.

850
00:50:35,321 --> 00:50:35,663
Rym: Yeah.

851
00:50:35,723 --> 00:50:36,024
Scott: Right.

852
00:50:36,326 --> 00:50:39,481
Scott: It was like, you know, it's sort of like people are getting in and out of the car.

853
00:50:39,501 --> 00:50:40,083
Scott: Right.

854
00:50:40,464 --> 00:50:54,219
Rym: And what you and you always and over time you see like it distills down to the people who are either too blind to what's happening or are too extreme or they're just in too deep and they can't admit to themselves that maybe they should back out.

855
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:55,221
Scott: Right.

856
00:50:55,241 --> 00:50:57,880
Scott: And then the car breaks, but it keeps walking anyway.

857
00:50:58,304 --> 00:50:59,840
Scott: But obviously doesn't walk into the water.

858
00:50:59,981 --> 00:51:00,465
Scott: Right.

859
00:51:00,505 --> 00:51:02,139
Scott: It's like they get to the final end.

860
00:51:02,683 --> 00:51:04,919
Scott: It's like who walks into the water and who doesn't.

861
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:05,402
Scott: Right.

862
00:51:05,422 --> 00:51:06,699
Scott: Who doesn't even go to begin with?

863
00:51:07,021 --> 00:51:17,417
Rym: Well, because very rarely, like look at look at the other plots, the person who's leading people to their deaths is rarely the one who suffers the direct consequences that their followers suffer.

864
00:51:20,026 --> 00:51:21,340
Scott: I mean, she really had nothing to lose.

865
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:21,741
Scott: Right.

866
00:51:21,761 --> 00:51:25,880
Scott: She was just a really poor person making dolls and selling them to this dude.

867
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:26,161
Scott: Right.

868
00:51:26,181 --> 00:51:28,079
Scott: It's like, yeah, yeah.

869
00:51:28,761 --> 00:51:37,539
Rym: One other thing I think we're talking about, it's seen from the beginning, but it's one of the last notes I had that I wanted to come back to that we didn't discuss the fact there's this hole in that police scene.

870
00:51:38,721 --> 00:51:50,881
Rym: I remember that the car, the police, when they first show up, are all identical and faceless, like he can't differentiate them like they're they are just the concept of police.

871
00:51:51,363 --> 00:51:58,800
Rym: But then there's a moment when suddenly a bunch of them all have specific faces and like suddenly he sees them all individually.

872
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:06,543
Rym: And remember when he sees them all, fucking none of them are like English going back to old times.

873
00:52:06,603 --> 00:52:19,040
Rym: We got Irish people and like all these different people who had immigrated and assimilated in previous eras who have now taken on the roles that the colonial oppressors gave them, basically being the police.

874
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:25,501
Rym: And that's that that faceless and then suddenly non faceless nature comes back time and time again.

875
00:52:25,842 --> 00:52:42,320
Rym: And that scene was just so directly like the allegory was hitting you in the face to make sure you don't miss it, because when they escape the hospital, all the animal people he's I remember the one animal person who helps them escape is like, that's the power of these English.

876
00:52:42,682 --> 00:52:45,720
Rym: They describe you and you become what they described.

877
00:52:48,122 --> 00:52:57,840
Rym: But when he calls the cops out, there's this great moment where suddenly like the cops kind of stop beating him up and they start to almost fight with each other a little bit.

878
00:52:58,161 --> 00:53:03,279
Rym: And then they realize what they're doing and they like turn around and unify and then resume beating the shit out of him.

879
00:53:04,121 --> 00:53:04,643
Scott: Mm hmm.

880
00:53:05,907 --> 00:53:12,239
Scott: Yeah, the whole the I guess we didn't comment too much about the act, like literally turning into some kind of devil beast.

881
00:53:12,641 --> 00:53:12,881
Scott: Right.

882
00:53:13,202 --> 00:53:24,180
Scott: And literally having some magical glowing halo, like somehow, you know, if they didn't die in the plane crash, it's like nobody's like all the people who aren't there.

883
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:27,200
Rym: The cops are just like, oh, what are you some kind of go person now?

884
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,879
Rym: Like they don't they don't even in any way react to that.

885
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:31,383
Scott: Right.

886
00:53:31,443 --> 00:53:44,879
Scott: It's like it's not, you know, even though it's supposed to be taking place in Earth, in London, UK, 1980s, whatever, it's like if there was a goat person in the 80s, people would have been like, holy shit, this wasn't some P.T.

887
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:45,788
Scott: Barnum stuff.

888
00:53:45,808 --> 00:53:46,740
Scott: This is the real deal.

889
00:53:47,082 --> 00:53:47,204
Rym: Right.

890
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:47,427
Rym: Of course.

891
00:53:47,448 --> 00:53:48,119
Rym: Clearly it is.

892
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:50,439
Rym: The allegory is around the people.

893
00:53:51,001 --> 00:53:58,180
Rym: That is their like projected perception of him as a nonwhite, what they presume to be illegal immigrant.

894
00:53:59,840 --> 00:53:59,961
Scott: Yeah.

895
00:53:59,982 --> 00:54:02,040
Scott: You know, but like it goes away.

896
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:04,390
Scott: It's like you would think that like that would like.

897
00:54:04,531 --> 00:54:08,640
Scott: if that happens in most books, that's a thing that like, you know, is like, well, it goes away.

898
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:10,459
Rym: And what was the place called the hot wax club?

899
00:54:11,783 --> 00:54:11,965
Rym: Yeah.

900
00:54:12,006 --> 00:54:12,148
Rym: Yeah.

901
00:54:12,188 --> 00:54:13,059
Rym: Hot wax, the nightclub.

902
00:54:15,082 --> 00:54:19,518
Rym: I have I have a page open where I have the list of names of characters and there's the names of places at the bottom.

903
00:54:21,121 --> 00:54:27,406
Scott: And then, you know, Gabriel's Halo, I think also goes away around like at the same time ish.

904
00:54:27,426 --> 00:54:29,340
Rym: Well, because eventually the veneer comes back.

905
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,585
Scott: Does it come back like one time?

906
00:54:30,706 --> 00:54:46,496
Rym: because the veneer of the divine falls away and what's left is humans dealing with the decisions they have made because no one's answering your questions but you and no one's holding you accountable to those questions and the answers and the decisions you make with the people around you.

907
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:50,656
Scott: But it's like, you know, it's normally right.

908
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:53,620
Scott: It's it's not like some, you know, lazy allegory.

909
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:58,340
Scott: We're like, aha, the bad guy turns into the devil and the good guy turns into the halo.

910
00:54:58,441 --> 00:55:00,260
Scott: And it's not the exact opposite either.

911
00:55:00,641 --> 00:55:00,903
Scott: Right.

912
00:55:00,963 --> 00:55:04,059
Scott: Where it's like, aha, the bad guy gets the halo, right?

913
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:05,800
Rym: Well, because they flip.

914
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:20,660
Rym: It's almost like a coin flipping through the air and who's, quote, good or bad or satanic or godly is almost like oscillating because they're both pulled in opposite directions by the culture they're assimilating into for different reasons.

915
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:21,941
Rym: Hmm.

916
00:55:23,245 --> 00:55:31,782
Rym: So, yeah, this book is absolutely 100 percent worth reading if you listen to all this and somehow like didn't read the book and just listen to the book club for some reason.

917
00:55:31,822 --> 00:55:34,640
Rym: Like, I wish I'd read this book sooner.

918
00:55:35,365 --> 00:55:36,179
Rym: I really enjoyed it.

919
00:55:37,202 --> 00:55:37,425
Scott: Yeah.

920
00:55:37,628 --> 00:55:38,439
Rym: Maybe a lot to think about.

921
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:39,417
Rym: I'm still thinking about it.

922
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:44,340
Scott: I mean, if you know, when you hear about alleged to say this all the time.

923
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:44,742
Scott: Right.

924
00:55:44,942 --> 00:55:50,180
Scott: But it's like when this is why I try not to, you know, spend too much time watching, reading.

925
00:55:50,441 --> 00:55:51,325
Rym: Yeah.

926
00:55:51,345 --> 00:55:55,511
Rym: We say with Evangelion, the anime, you might like it, you might hate it, you might hate anime.

927
00:55:55,532 --> 00:55:56,060
Rym: It doesn't matter.

928
00:55:56,320 --> 00:56:01,403
Rym: The fact that in the year two thousand and twenty three, people are still talking about it a lot.

929
00:56:01,945 --> 00:56:05,399
Rym: That means that it's worth figuring out what the deal is.

930
00:56:06,061 --> 00:56:09,080
Scott: If there was something that's legendary and famous that you've heard of.

931
00:56:09,342 --> 00:56:10,820
Scott: It's like, oh, that's a famous book.

932
00:56:10,941 --> 00:56:13,040
Scott: It's like is a reason the book got famous.

933
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:13,421
Scott: Yeah.

934
00:56:13,802 --> 00:56:18,260
Rym: You might not like it, but you should at least know something about it.

935
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:19,145
Scott: It's like, would I rather?

936
00:56:19,246 --> 00:56:22,308
Scott: it's like, you know, would I rather watch Citizen Kane or Star Wars and rather watch?

937
00:56:22,348 --> 00:56:23,760
Scott: I could watch Star Wars a hundred times.

938
00:56:24,141 --> 00:56:27,480
Scott: But Citizen Kane is famous for reasons.

939
00:56:27,641 --> 00:56:27,782
Scott: Right.

940
00:56:27,802 --> 00:56:29,760
Scott: It doesn't get famous just by random.

941
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:31,880
Scott: It's not like some random movie got picked to be famous.

942
00:56:32,001 --> 00:56:33,620
Scott: It's not like some random book.

943
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:34,583
Scott: Right.

944
00:56:34,904 --> 00:56:39,480
Scott: The book or the movie earned that legendary famousness somehow.

945
00:56:39,781 --> 00:56:40,082
Rym: Yeah.

946
00:56:40,142 --> 00:56:40,423
Scott: Right.

947
00:56:40,865 --> 00:56:44,680
Scott: And if you go and check it out, you will realize why.

948
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:45,001
Scott: It's like.

949
00:56:45,061 --> 00:56:46,426
Scott: I know it's like.

950
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:54,020
Scott: I can't even say it's like, yeah, I get is like an S-tier book, but I can't say that it exceeded expectations because it was such a famous book.

951
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:57,320
Scott: I expected it to be as I went in expecting.

952
00:56:57,620 --> 00:56:57,922
Rym: All right.

953
00:56:57,942 --> 00:57:00,500
Rym: He's one of the most famous authors of the modern.

954
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:02,480
Scott: It was merely like an eight year book.

955
00:57:02,561 --> 00:57:04,700
Scott: I would be like, oh, I heard I thought this book was legendary.

956
00:57:04,801 --> 00:57:05,447
Scott: What's going on?

957
00:57:05,507 --> 00:57:06,759
Scott: Yeah, it's just kind of good.

958
00:57:07,081 --> 00:57:12,354
Rym: I'm glad we picked this one instead of the other option, even though I do want to read it and I will read it at some point.

959
00:57:12,414 --> 00:57:12,940
Rym: for Coast Pendulum.

960
00:57:13,123 --> 00:57:14,220
Scott: It was decided randomly.

961
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:14,822
Scott: Yeah.

962
00:57:15,186 --> 00:57:16,660
Rym: But for Coast Pendulum, Umberto Eco.

963
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:16,980
Rym: Yeah.

964
00:57:17,321 --> 00:57:24,642
Rym: But one thing I know about Eco's writing is it is not quite as perfectly crafted as Rushdeez.

965
00:57:25,325 --> 00:57:30,558
Scott: I mean, I've heard of the other book and I've heard of Umberto Eco, but I've never similar.

966
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,800
Scott: I don't know what the contents of those books are.

967
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:36,140
Scott: I don't know anything about the person or anything.

968
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:37,323
Rym: So have you.

969
00:57:37,343 --> 00:57:42,380
Scott: But I would have similar high expectations from something that I've heard of and is clearly famous.

970
00:57:42,481 --> 00:57:43,090
Rym: Have you ever read?

971
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:43,819
Rym: It's not that long.

972
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:52,021
Rym: Umberto Eco, there's a he wrote an essay in the 90s titled Ur-Fascism and it is you should read it.

973
00:57:52,081 --> 00:58:03,260
Rym: It is it's pretty short and it is one of the most poignant, concise and well written descriptions of what fascism ultimately is that has ever been put to paper.

974
00:58:03,381 --> 00:58:07,520
Rym: Like it is a very important essay that I think more people should read.

975
00:58:08,041 --> 00:58:17,620
Rym: But Umberto Eco's writing is not as, I don't know, florid and pleasant as Rushdeez, like Rushdeez is just such a good writer.

976
00:58:18,281 --> 00:58:26,248
Rym: It the words felt they had a good brain feel as I read them in a way that important classic books for all time tend to have that

977
00:58:26,991 --> 00:58:35,042
Scott: it was definitely a situation where it's like, you know, like what how what like what life do you have to live to be able to learn to write like that?

978
00:58:35,182 --> 00:58:41,479
Scott: Yeah, it's like, OK, like what would I have to practice to write to arrange words in that order?

979
00:58:41,841 --> 00:58:54,040
Rym: Because I keep saying poetry in florid because if you haven't read this book yet, it the prose is I'd say 30 percent poetry, 70 percent novel, just the way it reads.

980
00:58:55,442 --> 00:58:55,663
Scott: All right.

981
00:58:55,884 --> 00:58:58,440
Scott: So I guess I had to pick some other books to read.

982
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:02,251
Rym: You don't have to pick it today, but if you're ready, I don't know if they're going to be as good as this one.

983
00:59:02,312 --> 00:59:02,454
Scott: No.

984
00:59:02,495 --> 00:59:02,839
Scott: So wait.

985
00:59:03,021 --> 00:59:06,079
Rym: I mean, we picked one of the most famous books of the modern era, so.

986
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:07,222
Scott: Yeah.

987
00:59:07,324 --> 00:59:07,707
Scott: So all right.

988
00:59:07,748 --> 00:59:08,617
Scott: So today is June 1st.

989
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:09,995
Scott: We start in the Pride Month.

990
00:59:10,036 --> 00:59:10,239
Scott: Yeah.

991
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:16,640
Scott: So I went and I looked around for some, you know, LGBTQ plus fiction.

992
00:59:17,921 --> 00:59:18,784
Scott: And so I found out.

993
00:59:19,385 --> 00:59:37,979
Scott: I found out that there is a famous gay author named Stephen Rowley, right, who is married to a author, Byron Lane, and they both released new books on May 30th, like a couple of days ago.

994
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:42,680
Rym: Oh, that's great, because Focos, Pendulum and Satanic Verses came out in the same year.

995
00:59:42,761 --> 00:59:44,119
Rym: That's why I picked them both as options.

996
00:59:44,884 --> 00:59:45,537
Scott: But hold on.

997
00:59:45,981 --> 00:59:50,201
Scott: Here's the problem, right, is I went and I checked out what the deal with these books are.

998
00:59:50,582 --> 00:59:51,645
Scott: Right.

999
00:59:51,665 --> 00:59:56,600
Scott: And Stephen Rowley's book, The Celebrants, sounds like it has some potential.

1000
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,739
Scott: Like I felt like I kind of would want to read that book.

1001
00:59:59,360 --> 00:59:59,853
Scott: All right.

1002
00:59:59,874 --> 01:00:00,120
Scott: All right.

1003
01:00:00,601 --> 01:00:02,600
Scott: Let me read a description of it here.

1004
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:03,222
Scott: Let me see.

1005
01:00:04,570 --> 01:00:06,280
Scott: There it is.

1006
01:00:07,681 --> 01:00:16,220
Scott: OK, so it's been a minute or five years since Jordan Vargas last saw his college friends and twenty eight years since their graduation, when their adult lives began.

1007
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:25,800
Scott: Now, Jordan, Geordie, Naomi, Craig and Marielle, like his five friends, are at the brink of a new decade, responsibilities of adulthood.

1008
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:26,961
Scott: Right.

1009
01:00:27,001 --> 01:00:29,780
Scott: They still haven't figured out their lives, blah, blah, blah.

1010
01:00:30,282 --> 01:00:32,080
Scott: Every year they have a reunion.

1011
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:36,774
Scott: They have a reunion in Big Sur, California, where they throw.

1012
01:00:37,356 --> 01:00:39,271
Scott: they throw each other living funerals.

1013
01:00:39,757 --> 01:00:39,940
Scott: Right.

1014
01:00:40,501 --> 01:00:42,637
Scott: Sort of like a weird friend tradition school.

1015
01:00:44,041 --> 01:00:52,300
Scott: But this time, right, you know, someone has a secret that's going to upend everything.

1016
01:00:53,383 --> 01:00:53,503
Scott: Right.

1017
01:00:53,523 --> 01:00:56,180
Scott: So that one that one sounds like I might want to read it.

1018
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:56,422
Scott: Right.

1019
01:00:56,442 --> 01:00:56,971
Scott: Possibly.

1020
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:57,398
Scott: Right.

1021
01:00:58,102 --> 01:00:58,966
Scott: All right.

1022
01:00:59,066 --> 01:01:02,140
Scott: The book by Byron Lane, Big Gay Wedding.

1023
01:01:03,945 --> 01:01:05,099
Scott: I don't feel like I want to read it.

1024
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:14,850
Scott: It's basically, you know, gay people go back to have a wedding in mom's barn in Louisiana.

1025
01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:15,460
Scott: Right.

1026
01:01:16,121 --> 01:01:19,220
Scott: And it's like, all right, I can I can see where that's going.

1027
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:19,941
Scott: Right.

1028
01:01:20,464 --> 01:01:22,960
Scott: It's a little on the nose, at least based on the description.

1029
01:01:24,385 --> 01:01:24,870
Scott: But that's OK.

1030
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:25,072
Scott: Right.

1031
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:28,620
Rym: Is it like a story or I don't know.

1032
01:01:30,022 --> 01:01:31,051
Scott: It's called Big Gay Wedding.

1033
01:01:31,092 --> 01:01:31,677
Scott: It just came out.

1034
01:01:32,821 --> 01:01:34,819
Scott: I'm you know, if that sounds good to you, go read it.

1035
01:01:35,283 --> 01:01:35,666
Scott: Right.

1036
01:01:36,313 --> 01:01:37,060
Scott: I'm not knocking it.

1037
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:38,240
Scott: I'm just saying me personally.

1038
01:01:38,761 --> 01:01:38,962
Scott: Right.

1039
01:01:39,022 --> 01:01:42,640
Scott: I don't want to put two choices out there and one of them is one I don't want.

1040
01:01:44,601 --> 01:01:54,002
Scott: So even though it would have been cool to pick the two books by the two gay married authors that came out on the same day as the two picks, I'm going to replace one of them.

1041
01:01:54,062 --> 01:01:54,304
Scott: OK.

1042
01:01:54,344 --> 01:01:56,980
Rym: You don't have to replace it today, but I know.

1043
01:01:57,140 --> 01:02:02,119
Scott: So I have a replacement, which is, I guess this book came out a while ago.

1044
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:03,323
Scott: Right.

1045
01:02:03,484 --> 01:02:05,479
Scott: But recently a Twitter account.

1046
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:07,128
Rym: Oh, you're you're going to pick.

1047
01:02:07,189 --> 01:02:08,560
Rym: This is how you lose the time war.

1048
01:02:08,881 --> 01:02:09,504
Rym: That's right.

1049
01:02:09,584 --> 01:02:12,580
Rym: So I know that everybody knows about Bigelow's Dickolas Wolfwood.

1050
01:02:13,681 --> 01:02:20,105
Scott: So recently a Twitter account, Bigelow's Dickolas Wolfwood tweeted about this book that's been out for a while.

1051
01:02:20,185 --> 01:02:23,179
Rym: I got to read the tweet because the tweet was like.

1052
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:23,581
Rym: I found it.

1053
01:02:24,373 --> 01:02:24,880
Rym: Here's the tweet.

1054
01:02:24,941 --> 01:02:26,011
Rym: I'm reading the entire thing.

1055
01:02:26,475 --> 01:02:26,899
Rym: Read this.

1056
01:02:27,201 --> 01:02:28,679
Rym: Do not look at me out there anything about it.

1057
01:02:28,902 --> 01:02:29,407
Rym: Just read it.

1058
01:02:29,488 --> 01:02:30,095
Rym: It's only like 200 pages.

1059
01:02:30,621 --> 01:02:31,772
Rym: You can download it on Audible.

1060
01:02:31,813 --> 01:02:32,480
Rym: It's only four hours.

1061
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:33,167
Rym: Do it right now.

1062
01:02:33,208 --> 01:02:34,220
Rym: I'm extremely serious.

1063
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:35,261
Scott: Right.

1064
01:02:35,342 --> 01:02:38,480
Scott: So there's a book called This is How We Lose the Time War.

1065
01:02:38,781 --> 01:02:40,198
Rym: This is how you lose the time war.

1066
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:41,521
Scott: Yeah.

1067
01:02:42,084 --> 01:02:44,480
Scott: And it's real short, just like Bigelow's Dickolas said.

1068
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:48,920
Scott: And it is indeed a lesbian romance book.

1069
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:50,004
Scott: That's not really a spoiler.

1070
01:02:52,233 --> 01:02:53,820
Scott: I already read the whole book because it's so short.

1071
01:02:56,101 --> 01:03:01,700
Scott: But yeah, that's also, you know, an appropriate selection for a Pride Month book club.

1072
01:03:01,781 --> 01:03:04,459
Scott: So you can either choose the book I already read.

1073
01:03:07,202 --> 01:03:11,980
Scott: That's mega popular or this new book that also seems very popular.

1074
01:03:15,022 --> 01:03:17,860
Rym: I guess you decided at the end of the last show.

1075
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:20,800
Rym: So I feel like I should keep that precedent going so we don't have it all.

1076
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:21,404
Rym: I like that.

1077
01:03:21,465 --> 01:03:22,800
Scott: I can't force you to do anything.

1078
01:03:22,901 --> 01:03:24,951
Rym: But I really want to read.

1079
01:03:25,011 --> 01:03:26,679
Rym: This is How You Lose the Time War.

1080
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:28,448
Rym: And I haven't yet.

1081
01:03:28,508 --> 01:03:29,899
Rym: So I think we should do that one.

1082
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:30,844
Scott: OK, good.

1083
01:03:30,865 --> 01:03:31,416
Scott: I already read it.

1084
01:03:31,437 --> 01:03:31,580
Scott: Good.

1085
01:03:32,381 --> 01:03:33,258
Scott: You saved me a lot of work.

1086
01:03:33,964 --> 01:03:35,299
Rym: Well, I think we should give the listener.

1087
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:36,282
Scott: Sorry.

1088
01:03:36,383 --> 01:03:37,660
Scott: Sorry to the two husbands.

1089
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:41,160
Scott: I want to just, you know, prop your books up again.

1090
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,260
Scott: Stephen Rowley and Byron Lane.

1091
01:03:43,901 --> 01:03:45,900
Scott: The books, The Celebrants and Big Gay Wedding.

1092
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:47,940
Rym: I think The Celebrants will return to our selection.

1093
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:50,619
Scott: If you're looking for some Pride Month beach reading, there you go.

1094
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:55,103
Rym: Because I'm going to bring it for Coast Pendulum back at some point in the decisions, but not in.

1095
01:03:55,245 --> 01:03:55,729
Scott: Oh, you get it.

1096
01:03:55,749 --> 01:03:56,960
Scott: We're going to allow reruns.

1097
01:03:57,180 --> 01:03:59,040
Rym: I think we can in the decisions if they weren't picked.

1098
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:02,099
Scott: But you could keep bringing a book back and keep trying it.

1099
01:04:02,540 --> 01:04:09,239
Rym: But I'm going to follow or I'm going to follow my own precedent in the same way that George Washington set a precedent of just not running for a third term.

1100
01:04:10,201 --> 01:04:15,284
Rym: I am just going to say that I will never bring the same book twice in a row in my decision.

1101
01:04:15,304 --> 01:04:16,900
Rym: There at least has to be twice in a row.

1102
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:20,780
Rym: OK, so I might bring that back at some point about you can't you can't try.

1103
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:24,320
Scott: You can't put it up if it gets chopped down three times.

1104
01:04:24,821 --> 01:04:25,563
Scott: That's it's dead.

1105
01:04:25,583 --> 01:04:26,848
Scott: I might go with.

1106
01:04:27,189 --> 01:04:33,900
Rym: if it gets chopped down, the time that's appropriate before you're allowed to bring it up again gets exponentially longer.

1107
01:04:34,722 --> 01:04:39,781
Scott: Oh, so it's like when you're trying to test to see the websites up again, it's like every second.

1108
01:04:40,082 --> 01:04:40,424
Scott: All right.

1109
01:04:40,524 --> 01:04:47,339
Rym: Every five seconds, like if it goes through like four book clubs from now, then I'm not going to bring it up again for years.

1110
01:04:49,262 --> 01:04:52,087
Rym: And if it doesn't make it to that point, I'm just going to bring it up when we're in the retirement home.

1111
01:04:52,107 --> 01:04:53,260
Scott: All right.

1112
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:58,240
Scott: So the next book is This Is How You Lose the Time War, which I already got from the library, read and returned today.

1113
01:04:58,580 --> 01:04:58,801
Rym: All right.

1114
01:04:58,821 --> 01:05:03,808
Rym: I'm going to follow the biggles dickles wolf woods advice and I'm not going to learn anything about it.

1115
01:05:03,849 --> 01:05:04,596
Rym: I'm just going to read it.

1116
01:05:05,981 --> 01:05:06,904
Rym: We'll give you a. we'll give you.

1117
01:05:06,924 --> 01:05:07,386
Rym: involves.

1118
01:05:07,948 --> 01:05:10,458
Scott: it involves a war time travel.

1119
01:05:11,463 --> 01:05:12,438
Rym: I imagine birds.

1120
01:05:13,641 --> 01:05:17,435
Scott: No, OK, because they're I mean, there's not no birds in it, but it does not.

1121
01:05:18,258 --> 01:05:19,044
Scott: it's not about birds.

1122
01:05:19,065 --> 01:05:19,979
Scott: It's birds on the cover.

1123
01:05:22,641 --> 01:05:26,740
Rym: There's one full quote from Madeline Miller and it just says this book has it all, period.

1124
01:05:27,961 --> 01:05:31,780
Scott: It does indeed have that is in a short amount of time.

1125
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,578
Scott: There's all is in there.

1126
01:05:37,108 --> 01:05:38,019
Rym: All right, I'm game.

1127
01:05:40,001 --> 01:05:46,294
Rym: We'll do that, I imagine we'll do this episode, not the next Thursday episode, but the following one, just to give it time for people to find out.

1128
01:05:46,334 --> 01:05:50,974
Rym: we did the book club and read the book, but might record it early because this doesn't.

1129
01:05:51,034 --> 01:05:53,999
Rym: it's 200 pages like I could read that in an afternoon.

1130
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:55,925
Scott: It's a very, very.

1131
01:05:56,226 --> 01:05:56,909
Scott: I was literally like.

1132
01:05:57,611 --> 01:06:00,923
Scott: actually I thought it was due today at the library, but it was due next week.

1133
01:06:02,088 --> 01:06:07,359
Scott: But because I thought it was due today, it's like I had 25 percent of the book left yesterday.

1134
01:06:08,221 --> 01:06:10,840
Scott: And it I guess I finished it before dinner.

1135
01:06:12,141 --> 01:06:14,429
Scott: It's just like it's super.

1136
01:06:14,529 --> 01:06:14,910
Scott: you know, it's.

1137
01:06:14,990 --> 01:06:18,960
Scott: I don't know if it's not Binti short now, but it's a short.

1138
01:06:24,470 --> 01:06:26,530
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1139
01:06:26,710 --> 01:06:31,814
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1140
01:06:32,014 --> 01:06:37,074
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

1141
01:06:37,295 --> 01:06:44,730
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1143
01:06:49,550 --> 01:06:52,550
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1144
01:06:52,790 --> 01:06:55,690
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1145
01:06:56,411 --> 01:06:59,850
Rym: And the GeekNights Patreon patrons want me to say their name on the show.

1146
01:07:00,251 --> 01:07:03,950
Rym: This episode are my filters not working the way I normally do.

1147
01:07:04,130 --> 01:07:05,468
Rym: So let me click on this until it works.

1148
01:07:06,710 --> 01:07:22,769
Rym: Linky, G-Dragon, Lily, Tenebra, Case, Care, Makes, Music, Chris, the Dodd, Clinton, Walton, Dex, Finn, Joel Hayes, Penny, Rhymer, Rebecca, Dunn, Sam, Erickson, Shervin, Von Hurl and a ton of people who give just a dollar, presumably to get access to that backup RSS feed, which is actually not too bad.

1149
01:07:23,573 --> 01:07:25,329
Rym: I use that to QA GeekNights sometimes.

1150
01:07:25,990 --> 01:07:27,297
Rym: But yeah, we're.

1151
01:07:27,317 --> 01:07:29,510
Rym: we're back from illness, back to do our thing.

1152
01:07:30,410 --> 01:07:37,790
Rym: Wednesday episodes might be temporarily saved because our cup overflow with lately suddenly, magically on Wednesday episodes.

1153
01:07:38,350 --> 01:07:40,410
Rym: So I expect next Wednesday we're going to talk about Spider-Man.

1154
01:07:40,910 --> 01:07:44,529
Rym: And for now, tonight, I leave you with.

1155
01:07:46,231 --> 01:07:47,628
Rym: Hi, Max Edrum here with.

1156
01:07:49,250 --> 01:07:50,169
Rym: This is my guest.

1157
01:07:52,694 --> 01:07:53,643
Rym: I heard you were big time in.

1158
01:07:53,663 --> 01:07:54,289
Rym: the old pop is.

1159
01:07:55,713 --> 01:07:57,050
Rym: I'm going to take that as a no comment.

1160
01:07:57,714 --> 01:07:58,770
Rym: So gritty time.

1161
01:07:59,110 --> 01:08:03,970
Rym: What I'm talking about and you're not is that more people prefer the new refreshing taste of Coke over Pepsi.

1162
01:08:04,938 --> 01:08:05,147
Rym: Sweaty.

1163
01:08:06,391 --> 01:08:06,712
Rym: It's true.

1164
01:08:06,993 --> 01:08:11,550
Rym: More people are, as we cokeologists say, catching the wave.

1165
01:08:12,050 --> 01:08:12,596
Rym: Catch it if you can.

1166
01:08:12,656 --> 01:08:13,950
Rym: Can catch the wave Coke.
