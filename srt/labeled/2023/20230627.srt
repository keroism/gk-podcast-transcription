00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,400
Rym: It's Tuesday June 27th 2023.

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,386
Rym: I'm Rym Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:15,427 --> 00:00:18,795
Rym: We are talking about worker placements the game mechanic.

4
00:00:19,517 --> 00:00:20,539
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:22,384 --> 00:00:26,328
Scott: So today I was just thinking random thoughts Like you do like me.

6
00:00:27,011 --> 00:00:28,600
Scott: Yeah, and I was like, hey, you know what?

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,812
Scott: You know, there's a. there's an animal called a an anteater, right?

8
00:00:33,173 --> 00:00:35,260
Scott: Yeah, and we know we've seen anteaters, right?

9
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,590
Scott: They get a long snooty and they get their long tongue.

10
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:42,180
Scott: that comes out and they stick it down the hole where the ants live And they ant the ante Hill and they eat all the ants.

11
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:45,276
Rym: There's a lot of other animals that he dance, but they're not called anteaters.

12
00:00:45,618 --> 00:00:45,900
Rym: They are.

13
00:00:46,281 --> 00:00:48,588
Rym: Yeah, but there's also anteaters.

14
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:50,414
Scott: We call the anteater an anteater.

15
00:00:50,574 --> 00:00:51,537
Scott: It eats ants a lot.

16
00:00:51,597 --> 00:00:52,500
Scott: It's like a favorite food.

17
00:00:52,601 --> 00:00:54,329
Scott: It didn't get its name for no reason.

18
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:55,515
Rym: We got other animals like that.

19
00:00:55,535 --> 00:00:56,460
Rym: There's all the egg snakes.

20
00:00:57,042 --> 00:00:58,488
Scott: Sure, but I'm talking about anteaters here.

21
00:00:58,588 --> 00:01:01,760
Scott: an anteater is specially equipped for ants, right?

22
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:06,213
Scott: It's like got a built-in ant hill eating mechanism.

23
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:21,520
Scott: Yeah, right and I was thinking you know What if an anteater goes to eat ants but they turn out to be like those fucking nasty-ass fire ants who are like all You know bitey bitey Is he gonna get bit all on the tongue and or like get ants all over its face and get and get bit up by?

24
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,451
Scott: The ants, you know, who's gonna?

25
00:01:23,471 --> 00:01:24,497
Scott: who's gonna win that fight?

26
00:01:24,557 --> 00:01:31,440
Rym: this, you know Covered with thousands of tiny hooks which are to hold the insects in place covered with a large amount of saliva.

27
00:01:32,161 --> 00:01:42,768
Scott: but so I did a little research and apparently I am NOT the first person far from the first person to have this question of anteater verse Fire ant who wins right?

28
00:01:42,829 --> 00:01:45,880
Rym: I started googling it as soon as I realized what you were asking.

29
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,570
Scott: So I was curious to save you to save you a Google.

30
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,015
Scott: Here's the answer right?

31
00:01:50,496 --> 00:01:51,520
Scott: Is that the fire ant?

32
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,640
Scott: I mean the anteater doesn't really have a special tool.

33
00:01:54,741 --> 00:01:58,725
Scott: Like if it gets bit by fire ants it still fucking hurts Right, but he has.

34
00:01:58,746 --> 00:02:01,234
Scott: the only special tool it has is his fur.

35
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:06,080
Scott: if the ants get on the fur It'll take them a little while to get down to the skin and start biting.

36
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:13,320
Scott: I guess it could get bit on the tongue But I guess he could eat those and kill them pretty quick by sucking him in suck him into the desert, right?

37
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:21,706
Scott: But the main technique the anteater has for dealing with nasty ants instead of regular old Ants know is he just doesn't see.

38
00:02:21,726 --> 00:02:29,132
Scott: he goes in he starts eating ants real quick before they notice and when they realize when the ants Realize what's happening and they get into bite mode.

39
00:02:29,152 --> 00:02:29,736
Scott: He runs away.

40
00:02:30,339 --> 00:02:31,464
Rym: Ah Smart anteater.

41
00:02:31,806 --> 00:02:34,680
Scott: He just goes in and he's like, you know, ooh fire ants, huh?

42
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,269
Scott: Well, you can't just sit around a feast.

43
00:02:36,309 --> 00:02:40,847
Scott: We got to be like nom nom nom nom nom nom and that's that's how.

44
00:02:41,348 --> 00:02:48,680
Scott: or maybe he waits like the first ant to bite him and then runs it just as a reaction, but That's how ant eaters deal with fire.

45
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:57,411
Scott: and so in the battle of ant eater verse fire ants who wins the ant eater could eat them all if they are patient enough to Be like, is he gone now?

46
00:02:57,551 --> 00:02:58,917
Scott: All right back to chill mode.

47
00:02:59,198 --> 00:03:06,056
Rym: Oh no For you nerds the anteaters probing and then kiting the ants to make sure you can get them without getting.

48
00:03:06,216 --> 00:03:18,053
Scott: if the anteater was a Dumb dumb and we just kept on eating the fire ants could mess up the the anteater pretty bad with their their nibblies Depending on which kind they are.

49
00:03:18,174 --> 00:03:25,267
Scott: All right So, uh, so if you have a fire ant infestation on at your house You wouldn't go and like rent an anteater.

50
00:03:25,307 --> 00:03:26,651
Scott: That would not be a good technique.

51
00:03:26,932 --> 00:03:29,240
Rym: Yeah, I don't know what to do if I'm fire ants.

52
00:03:30,123 --> 00:03:33,333
Scott: Uh, I am now live where fire ants live.

53
00:03:33,373 --> 00:03:36,386
Rym: fire ants live is creeping north fast You what else is creeping north?

54
00:03:36,406 --> 00:03:38,698
Rym: There have been a bunch of malaria cases in the US now.

55
00:03:39,582 --> 00:03:41,046
Scott: Yeah, I heard about that too.

56
00:03:41,126 --> 00:03:45,720
Scott: And the answer is if the malaria reaches, Virginia, we'll go get malaria vaccines.

57
00:03:45,921 --> 00:03:46,725
Scott: Yeah, it's.

58
00:03:46,886 --> 00:03:55,587
Rym: uh, it's funny because way back in the Roman times No, Rome was the like the city and The rich people would live there Except in the summer.

59
00:03:55,607 --> 00:04:02,198
Rym: if them if there was too much malaria They would all head north for the summer and they come back down to Rome and like.

60
00:04:02,218 --> 00:04:10,326
Scott: that was a thing All my grandparents they went south In the winter, right?

61
00:04:10,426 --> 00:04:12,352
Scott: Yeah, I guess we're gonna do the opposite.

62
00:04:12,372 --> 00:04:13,817
Rym: We're gonna head north in the summer, right?

63
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:18,899
Scott: So we'll still be further south in the colder time.

64
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:23,449
Rym: but Yeah We gotta do something about climate change.

65
00:04:23,469 --> 00:04:33,806
Rym: because I the other thing I saw is so, you know the other week we had the the sky turned blue blocker orange for a couple days in New York and Apparently that happened in Chicago.

66
00:04:33,846 --> 00:04:35,593
Rym: now exact same situation.

67
00:04:35,634 --> 00:04:36,959
Rym: Chicago got hit just like we did.

68
00:04:37,722 --> 00:04:42,220
Scott: The fundamental thing is if you want to solve climate change, we are going to need a lot of people.

69
00:04:42,502 --> 00:04:48,940
Scott: We're going to have to suffer Large or perhaps even we don't even have to suffer that much in convenience.

70
00:04:49,141 --> 00:04:49,502
Rym: I want to.

71
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:50,085
Rym: there will be.

72
00:04:50,266 --> 00:05:03,998
Scott: there will be some amount of noticeable Inconvenience that you must in less than we'd expect because from what I've seen There is a. it is still not zero and the problem is even the most minor inconvenience.

73
00:05:04,099 --> 00:05:07,995
Scott: Oh, yeah Fight in any government in any country on earth.

74
00:05:08,056 --> 00:05:12,759
Rym: tell it American Their car has to get one more mile per gallon 20 years from now and they'll pull out a gun.

75
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:25,055
Rym: But the stat was basically if Americans just Americans ate like 4% less beef just beef a year.

76
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:31,380
Rym: that would make a Material impact on climate change almost immediately like that would be better.

77
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:32,203
Scott: We could do that.

78
00:05:32,263 --> 00:05:42,519
Scott: we could do that by just you know mandating by law beef Production and import oddities or even just to force secretly force McDonald's.

79
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,348
Rym: Yeah, take 4% on all your burgers.

80
00:05:44,388 --> 00:05:48,582
Rym: That would actually save the planet Mm-hmm.

81
00:05:48,963 --> 00:05:49,564
Rym: Yeah, never mind.

82
00:05:49,605 --> 00:05:51,229
Rym: Not even kind of quarter-pounder.

83
00:05:51,330 --> 00:06:00,854
Rym: It would be 96 percent times point two five Like if we told the average American we're gonna reduce your McDonald's by 4%.

84
00:06:00,854 --> 00:06:03,244
Rym: some percentage of them would decide that a gun is The answer to that.

85
00:06:03,264 --> 00:06:04,050
Scott: it would be a point.

86
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,439
Scott: Oh six to five pounder.

87
00:06:07,421 --> 00:06:07,923
Rym: Well, just call it.

88
00:06:07,963 --> 00:06:09,289
Scott: I know it would know that's not right.

89
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:09,771
Scott: That's not right.

90
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:11,699
Rym: We'll just call it a Royale and walk away.

91
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,409
Rym: Redefine what a quarter pound is Or it still weighs a quarter pound.

92
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:18,738
Rym: just fill it with fake meat.

93
00:06:19,841 --> 00:06:20,042
Rym: Saw.

94
00:06:20,123 --> 00:06:20,525
Rym: it would be.

95
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:25,405
Scott: it would be a point to four pounder Instead of a point to five.

96
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:29,460
Rym: so, you know way back we did a review of Marvel snap and it's pretty good game.

97
00:06:29,601 --> 00:06:31,369
Rym: But it was pretty simple Scott.

98
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:36,220
Scott: I think you said yeah when I mean when it came out I was like, you know, hey, this is my kind of game.

99
00:06:36,421 --> 00:06:40,658
Scott: But right now at the time it was released we did you know, I was like this is just.

100
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:46,836
Scott: you know It's got this micro transaction nonsense and it's sort of grindy and it's just a ladder and there's no multiplayer.

101
00:06:46,896 --> 00:06:48,100
Scott: There's no competitive scene.

102
00:06:48,582 --> 00:06:50,671
Scott: I'm not gonna play it if it doesn't have those things.

103
00:06:50,712 --> 00:06:54,004
Scott: and then it added those things I'm like, well they added the things.

104
00:06:54,245 --> 00:06:55,087
Scott: so I started playing.

105
00:06:55,107 --> 00:07:04,942
Rym: when they added I gave them one unit of money once which I actually Regret because it got me like modok and a bunch of stuff I needed for a deck and now I'm you don't they're never Getting.

106
00:07:05,042 --> 00:07:07,895
Scott: you know, we could talk about the microtransactions more.

107
00:07:07,955 --> 00:07:09,060
Scott: I guess we did already.

108
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,795
Scott: But the thing I've learned about the microtransactions that is not.

109
00:07:12,815 --> 00:07:14,120
Scott: I'm not to say they're good, right?

110
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,069
Scott: But they're less evil than some of the others.

111
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,180
Scott: Is that basically they top out?

112
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:25,929
Scott: It's like you can actually sort of get all or most of the cards and then it's like you actually get Diminishing returns like if you have.

113
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:28,220
Scott: I went and threw hundreds of dollars at the game.

114
00:07:28,783 --> 00:07:31,360
Scott: I would get basically nothing for my money, right?

115
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:40,479
Scott: It's like it's pointless to spend more than like this certain reasonable ish amount You know and it's it's cheaper than netrunner, right?

116
00:07:41,663 --> 00:07:49,662
Scott: So if you see if you pay anyway They add that the big news is that they added this conquest mode and that's a even though he did a whole show on this Game.

117
00:07:50,044 --> 00:07:53,339
Scott: the conquest mode is a bit, you know, there's a lot of other news about the game, too.

118
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:57,593
Scott: But at this mode is a big enough deal to be a news, right?

119
00:07:57,613 --> 00:08:16,479
Scott: So at the conquest mode is it is very similar along the lines of what Richard Garfield suggested what I heard from Richard Garfield and then modified and also suggested right they have done an implementation of Sort of automatic tournaments in sort of yep.

120
00:08:16,901 --> 00:08:24,409
Scott: It's better than any car online digital card turn based kind of game And I know of.

121
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:32,100
Rym: I'm gonna give you this point in history Just like how Scott was like, yeah spider-man My is good enough to where we could say it's a classic for all time right now.

122
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,650
Rym: Like I got to say something about mark cuz Marvel snap.

123
00:08:35,371 --> 00:08:36,517
Rym: That was a pooping game for me.

124
00:08:36,798 --> 00:08:37,260
Rym: I got a poop.

125
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:39,186
Rym: I'll play a snap like that's just.

126
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:41,934
Rym: I really didn't play it other than when I was bored idle.

127
00:08:42,115 --> 00:08:43,520
Rym: I like waiting for something pooping.

128
00:08:44,862 --> 00:08:46,029
Rym: I didn't have it installed in steam.

129
00:08:46,069 --> 00:08:49,500
Rym: I looked at on my phone conquest mode Reinstall it on steam.

130
00:08:49,881 --> 00:08:55,702
Rym: I will sit at my desk and play conquest mode the way I would play overwatch or counter-strike Cuz.

131
00:08:55,742 --> 00:08:57,347
Scott: basically it's like a game of Marvel.

132
00:08:57,387 --> 00:09:00,216
Scott: snap is not a very, you know deep game.

133
00:09:00,256 --> 00:09:01,580
Scott: It's pretty it's a lot very random.

134
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,507
Rym: It's very it's really.

135
00:09:02,548 --> 00:09:04,020
Rym: just do I snap or do I retreat?

136
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:19,560
Scott: Right, but when you have to play a car a whole conquest mode right where you're playing to get to ten points against the same opponent in repeated games That L that entire battle is about equivalent to a whole game of like Magic the Gathering, right?

137
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:28,100
Scott: so Already that is significant that you're playing the sort of battle mode not just against friends, but against strangers, right?

138
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:33,940
Scott: But they put it in the context of the conquest is you're basically playing in a tournament whenever you want.

139
00:09:34,121 --> 00:09:34,984
Scott: So here's how it works.

140
00:09:35,446 --> 00:09:39,220
Scott: The first genius thing they did is the proving grounds, right?

141
00:09:40,271 --> 00:09:45,260
Scott: So in other card games they have like or other online multiplayer games this casual mode.

142
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:50,276
Scott: Right a casual mode in most games means play meaningless game.

143
00:09:50,296 --> 00:09:54,694
Rym: Yep, overwatch casual mode Literally worthless like not playable.

144
00:09:55,397 --> 00:09:59,937
Scott: right in Hearthstone they had casual mode and it was just play a meaningless game against a random opponent.

145
00:09:59,977 --> 00:10:04,431
Scott: and the thing is Even for people who want to play and not competitively.

146
00:10:04,531 --> 00:10:07,720
Scott: casual mode is kind of air because people aren't trying.

147
00:10:08,142 --> 00:10:09,850
Scott: People are just not caring.

148
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,720
Scott: you're not like getting the real game.

149
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,920
Scott: Yeah, people aren't even trying to win half the time, right?

150
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,727
Scott: So it's like not you know, it's like not.

151
00:10:16,787 --> 00:10:17,911
Scott: the results don't matter.

152
00:10:17,952 --> 00:10:20,120
Scott: But also the game is not the same game.

153
00:10:20,221 --> 00:10:22,173
Scott: It's just peacely people playing cards.

154
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:23,280
Scott: nonsense, right?

155
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:27,460
Scott: It's you're not actually playing the game even if you don't care about competing.

156
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:37,520
Scott: So the proving grounds is an effect a casual mode where there are no Consequences for losing therefore and you can play it infinitely.

157
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:38,899
Scott: It could play it as much as you want.

158
00:10:39,341 --> 00:10:44,335
Scott: So you could just battle up random opponents as much as you want with no consequence of losing.

159
00:10:44,415 --> 00:10:46,340
Scott: and therefore that's casual mode.

160
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,808
Scott: You could just play whatever rando deck with.

161
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:50,252
Scott: you can test out decks.

162
00:10:50,313 --> 00:10:52,640
Scott: You can experiment you could just play a fun.

163
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,425
Scott: I only play fun decks in proving grounds.

164
00:10:54,465 --> 00:10:58,537
Scott: I don't play serious ones because you know, why right and so.

165
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:02,980
Scott: but the thing is when you Win in proving grounds you get a silver ticket.

166
00:11:03,161 --> 00:11:11,294
Scott: So because there is a reward for winning and no a real reward for winning and no punishment for losing People still try.

167
00:11:11,314 --> 00:11:16,920
Scott: they play Properly, right and you sort of care if you win a little bit, right?

168
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,888
Scott: but if you don't care if you lose and I Can't think what other game is there that that's like that.

169
00:11:21,928 --> 00:11:28,799
Scott: We're like, you know, usually it's like when you have a prize for winning Let's say a cash prize like losing feels bad.

170
00:11:29,724 --> 00:11:35,266
Scott: You don't want to lose but they somehow perfectly tuned it to where Winning is okay.

171
00:11:35,286 --> 00:11:37,616
Scott: You get a silver ticket and losing you don't give a shit.

172
00:11:37,736 --> 00:11:38,118
Scott: Yeah, right.

173
00:11:38,942 --> 00:11:42,680
Scott: And so perfect casual mode is the first aspect of and that's just a subset, right?

174
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:49,571
Scott: so you get the silver ticket and you can get as many as you can get and You use the silver ticket to enter the silver conquest.

175
00:11:49,632 --> 00:11:51,940
Scott: and now the silver conquest is now serious business.

176
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,084
Rym: Yeah, it's like.

177
00:11:53,164 --> 00:11:54,589
Rym: alright now you're gonna win something.

178
00:11:54,609 --> 00:11:56,476
Scott: good you spend a silver ticket.

179
00:11:56,556 --> 00:11:57,640
Scott: You can't get it back.

180
00:11:58,162 --> 00:12:00,493
Scott: You could spend gold instead of a silver ticket.

181
00:12:00,533 --> 00:12:01,880
Scott: That is a sucker's game.

182
00:12:01,961 --> 00:12:04,420
Rym: Just hang out in the proving ground for like a couple never do that.

183
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,003
Scott: Yeah, never.

184
00:12:05,244 --> 00:12:06,611
Scott: you would be a fool to do that.

185
00:12:06,652 --> 00:12:08,119
Scott: You got an absolute fool.

186
00:12:09,501 --> 00:12:10,926
Scott: And so you play.

187
00:12:10,946 --> 00:12:14,880
Scott: you have to beat you to play basically two battles against two opponents.

188
00:12:15,462 --> 00:12:20,080
Scott: But as you pace one opponent, yeah, if you don't beat them, you just you're out of the conquest.

189
00:12:20,361 --> 00:12:21,444
Scott: All right, you lose your ticket.

190
00:12:21,966 --> 00:12:27,563
Scott: if you beat them you face a second opponent, right if you lose to them again You just lost your ticket.

191
00:12:27,604 --> 00:12:27,985
Scott: you're out.

192
00:12:28,486 --> 00:12:36,403
Scott: But if you beat that second opponent, so two in a row you get a golden tickets Right.

193
00:12:36,685 --> 00:12:47,865
Scott: Yeah, then when you use the golden ticket, it's the same thing But you have to beat three opponents in a row in order to upgrade your golden ticket to the infinity Ticket.

194
00:12:47,905 --> 00:12:48,900
Scott: Yeah, right.

195
00:12:49,241 --> 00:12:50,866
Scott: So it's like you now are.

196
00:12:51,006 --> 00:13:00,475
Scott: you've just played in a tournament that effectively was a single elimination tournament like a NCAA bracket, right and it had five rounds.

197
00:13:00,976 --> 00:13:06,953
Scott: if you have five rounds That's basically against 32 people who put in a silver ticket.

198
00:13:07,174 --> 00:13:10,343
Scott: One of them will emerge with an infinity thing Right.

199
00:13:10,704 --> 00:13:13,111
Scott: So it's like playing at a tournament of 32 people.

200
00:13:13,151 --> 00:13:20,747
Scott: now if the thing is you don't have all 32 people like lined up At the start committing to play at the same time It's just when you choose play.

201
00:13:21,108 --> 00:13:25,827
Scott: you play against someone who is currently at the same Bracket level that you're at.

202
00:13:25,867 --> 00:13:26,932
Scott: And this is brilliant.

203
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,640
Rym: because right why are ladders?

204
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,268
Scott: It's someone who's made it through four rounds.

205
00:13:31,368 --> 00:13:33,516
Scott: just like you you've made it through four rounds.

206
00:13:33,596 --> 00:13:37,971
Rym: ladders are popular Just because it's very easy to have matchmaking in.

207
00:13:38,011 --> 00:13:40,940
Rym: like overwatch or something - I want to play a serious game.

208
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:44,920
Rym: It'll just put me in a serious game and it'll give me ladder rewards.

209
00:13:45,244 --> 00:13:51,540
Rym: This just lets me have a tournament But I still just click a button and get into a serious game and you can play the games whenever you want.

210
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,146
Scott: You can switch decks each round.

211
00:13:53,186 --> 00:13:54,090
Scott: who cares right?

212
00:13:54,170 --> 00:14:06,740
Scott: It's just when once you commit it's like, alright you're gonna play someone who's at the same distance through the bracket that you are and You are gonna spend your ticket and you your deck is locked in and you're gonna play a ten cube game.

213
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:08,929
Scott: And if you retreat from this game, that's it.

214
00:14:08,969 --> 00:14:09,491
Scott: You're lost.

215
00:14:09,531 --> 00:14:11,760
Scott: And if you win congrats you go you can get play again.

216
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:19,964
Rym: I am surprised of how many people concede Against me in matches when there's literally no reason to Yeah fight to the end.

217
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:20,586
Rym: I have come back.

218
00:14:20,867 --> 00:14:22,091
Rym: I came back from.

219
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:26,859
Rym: I only had two health left and they were fucking me up All the way to victory just by being patient.

220
00:14:28,002 --> 00:14:28,869
Scott: Maybe they got a good.

221
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:29,695
Scott: it's a phone game.

222
00:14:29,755 --> 00:14:31,604
Scott: I don't care I take the win.

223
00:14:32,086 --> 00:14:32,708
Scott: and then what?

224
00:14:32,749 --> 00:14:35,900
Scott: the golden ticket upgrades to the infinity ticket, right?

225
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:44,837
Scott: Now the infinity ticket is special because you can't use the infinity ticket whenever you want Just like the other tickets you can use whenever you want the silvers and golds.

226
00:14:45,461 --> 00:14:49,895
Scott: The infinity one can only be used in the final week of the season which has just begun.

227
00:14:49,935 --> 00:14:53,747
Scott: the very first infinity ticket Season has just started right?

228
00:14:53,787 --> 00:14:57,680
Scott: So this week is the only chance to use your infinity tickets next week.

229
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,040
Scott: You won't that's it closed.

230
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:04,160
Scott: You got to wait a whole nother set of weeks like four weeks to use them again if you gonna start from scratch, right?

231
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:10,660
Scott: so It's like during this time period you got to use as many infinity tickets as you got.

232
00:15:11,241 --> 00:15:19,972
Scott: Maybe try to get some more and if you can to get the infinity ticket you and upgrade it You have to win five in a row.

233
00:15:19,992 --> 00:15:23,426
Scott: So that's basically another 32 player tournament.

234
00:15:23,466 --> 00:15:24,389
Scott: so you have to beat.

235
00:15:25,171 --> 00:15:28,140
Scott: let's see a 32 player tournament a 10 round tournament.

236
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:30,720
Scott: 10 is 2 to the 10th power.

237
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,345
Scott: Is that how many players are in there?

238
00:15:32,546 --> 00:15:39,219
Rym: right and I love how it feels like the old golden ticket raffles at RIT anime Like hold on to that ticket for the end of the season.

239
00:15:42,224 --> 00:15:44,439
Scott: I do the math here to to the.

240
00:15:46,122 --> 00:15:47,470
Scott: This is not a good calculator.

241
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,219
Rym: That's why I have one infinity ticket.

242
00:15:50,922 --> 00:15:52,287
Scott: Yeah, two to the fifth power is 32.

243
00:15:52,287 --> 00:16:11,180
Scott: So two to the tenth power is 1024. so out of every 1024 players Right who start in the and win approving grounds and throw a silver ticket down One of them will emerge as an infinity conquest champion.

244
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:23,538
Scott: Right and they get basically their up avatar that they were using on the deck that they were playing gets a fancy shiny cosmetic thing to prove that they were that good and that lucky that they made it.

245
00:16:23,558 --> 00:16:26,287
Scott: and Now it's just a cosmetic prize.

246
00:16:26,548 --> 00:16:33,371
Scott: who cares right, but that's like It's so hard to get that right to win it.

247
00:16:33,572 --> 00:16:40,313
Scott: imagine it an NCAA tournament bracket with 1024 people and you win without losing once.

248
00:16:40,755 --> 00:16:42,140
Scott: no losers bracket, right?

249
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:50,637
Scott: And it's like yeah, you could enter the tournament as many times as you want But it's like even if you held how many of those tournaments would you need to enter to win one of?

250
00:16:50,717 --> 00:16:59,392
Rym: I mean even getting the winner winner chicken dinner equivalent in whatever like Battle royale game you're playing feels pretty good.

251
00:16:59,412 --> 00:17:01,199
Rym: This is rarer than that, right?

252
00:17:01,761 --> 00:17:05,220
Scott: It's like it that you can enter this tournament as many times as you like.

253
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:11,917
Scott: We'll just keep holding brand new tournaments for you all the all day long as many as you want as long as much time as you're willing to invest.

254
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,666
Scott: every Tournament has a thousand and twenty four entrants.

255
00:17:15,008 --> 00:17:15,849
Scott: You're one of them.

256
00:17:16,472 --> 00:17:19,060
Scott: Can you even win one of these tournaments, right?

257
00:17:19,364 --> 00:17:20,298
Scott: That is so hard.

258
00:17:20,721 --> 00:17:28,119
Scott: So you getting that avatar and then displaying it is like walking into the boxing ring when your manager is holding belts, right?

259
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:37,508
Rym: It's like, you know, you intimidate anyone you will ever play again and unlike a lot of the grind Achievement type things that a lot of games have.

260
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:41,080
Rym: this one is a skill based thing like luck.

261
00:17:41,322 --> 00:17:42,573
Scott: There is there is luck.

262
00:17:42,634 --> 00:17:43,360
Scott: It's a game of luck.

263
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:49,889
Scott: Yeah, the luck does fact less luck because each opponent you're not playing just one game You're playing ten cubes work.

264
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:51,780
Scott: so you can overcome luck.

265
00:17:51,901 --> 00:18:06,613
Rym: but with lots of games or luck you know filters out with with lots of repeated games or two decisions you made like I made a deck and I happen to bump into someone who has the Absolute paper to my deck like I'm my deck is a rock happens.

266
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:08,440
Scott: Yep, it happens.

267
00:18:10,101 --> 00:18:11,125
Scott: But yeah, this is like.

268
00:18:11,567 --> 00:18:14,879
Rym: this is pretty pretty great and the games are good like the games are.

269
00:18:16,307 --> 00:18:23,980
Scott: When you get to the goal If you spend a gold ticket you're playing against somebody who is already won a round of 32 like a big turn, right?

270
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:31,954
Rym: This is someone like they see in round one that I don't know A car just automatically discards from your hand.

271
00:18:31,974 --> 00:18:33,240
Rym: They're like, oh they're playing a discard deck.

272
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,970
Rym: They're probably playing a hella discard deck and then they play.

273
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,977
Rym: I don't know they play Sunspot.

274
00:18:37,998 --> 00:18:41,100
Rym: You're like, alright Yeah, that doesn't tell me anything about what deck you're using.

275
00:18:41,862 --> 00:18:47,399
Scott: So anyway the whole month so far I earned three infinity tickets and then they let you buy one for free kind of.

276
00:18:48,004 --> 00:18:55,700
Scott: and then So I used one of them so far and I got to the fourth round and then I lost in the fourth round.

277
00:18:55,923 --> 00:18:59,770
Scott: So I would have had to beat that Opponent and one more opponent to get to the top.

278
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:02,420
Scott: and I so I was that close on my first infinity ticket.

279
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,940
Scott: I don't know anyone who's made it so far to the top.

280
00:19:07,101 --> 00:19:10,679
Rym: I just want to have my default avatar with the infinity banner around it.

281
00:19:11,821 --> 00:19:16,580
Scott: I just I just want to you know be the champ right or a champ one of the one of the chance.

282
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,640
Rym: You want to be the very best like no one?

283
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,380
Scott: There are some people out there who might have who might have done it twice already.

284
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,140
Scott: I'm sure there's some streamers who play snap all day who've probably done it.

285
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,076
Rym: I mean in the fact one of the questions was can I earn multiple avatars?

286
00:19:28,217 --> 00:19:31,155
Scott: and the answer is yes Absolutely as many as you can get.

287
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,097
Scott: good luck You know.

288
00:19:34,061 --> 00:19:35,268
Scott: So that's it's pretty awesome.

289
00:19:35,309 --> 00:19:36,938
Scott: No other game that I know of has this.

290
00:19:37,882 --> 00:19:38,644
Scott: This is really good.

291
00:19:38,725 --> 00:19:50,080
Rym: So speaking of microtransactions and avatars and stuff battle passes Which are there is a battle pass sort of equivalent in snap that you could care about or not care about.

292
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,085
Rym: I just don't bother with it.

293
00:19:52,049 --> 00:19:52,591
Scott: Uh, I don't.

294
00:19:52,611 --> 00:19:54,540
Scott: it's like the only good value for your money though.

295
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:59,180
Rym: Yeah, if you're gonna spend money, that's the thing to spend money on but I'm not spending money.

296
00:19:59,461 --> 00:20:02,778
Rym: But if you're gonna I'm not judging you do it that way.

297
00:20:04,362 --> 00:20:06,833
Rym: So a lot of games have battle passes.

298
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:08,360
Rym: battle passes are not all equivalent.

299
00:20:08,501 --> 00:20:13,420
Rym: They are made with season passes battle some kind of pass and they're all made with different levels of success.

300
00:20:13,621 --> 00:20:22,840
Rym: But valve the story was valve is ditching battle passes because most players Literally to never buy one and that was the headline everywhere.

301
00:20:22,945 --> 00:20:37,263
Rym: But yes the actual details are valve which also has battle passes for counter-strike and I don't think they're getting rid of those is Ditching their battle passes for dota 2. and while it is true that basically they shared the data Nobody buys this thing.

302
00:20:37,283 --> 00:20:43,600
Rym: You have to be an absolute sucker to buy this thing because it basically doesn't get you anything.

303
00:20:44,084 --> 00:20:46,180
Rym: But it also might have been the first battle pass.

304
00:20:46,922 --> 00:20:51,956
Rym: So in some ways it broke ground, but basically valve is just saying it didn't work.

305
00:20:52,297 --> 00:20:54,706
Rym: It didn't make us money But the buried lead.

306
00:20:54,726 --> 00:20:55,510
Rym: that's interesting.

307
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:57,860
Rym: Is that the number of people?

308
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:07,680
Rym: Inside of valve that they said we're basically wasting their time with weeaboo like wasting their time Trying to come up with good stuff to put in the battle pass.

309
00:21:08,102 --> 00:21:12,579
Rym: They were like we just saved a ton of money and are probably doing better by just killing this whole fucking thing.

310
00:21:13,543 --> 00:21:21,747
Scott: Yeah, I think you know I don't know much about how that battle pass and dota to work because someone told me that some of the rewards are Temporary and you lose the yes.

311
00:21:21,787 --> 00:21:24,136
Scott: I heard someone told me that as well that some of it.

312
00:21:24,156 --> 00:21:25,360
Scott: They're all cosmetic rewards.

313
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:32,220
Scott: There are no real rewards because it's not it's only cosmetic stuff and that some of the cosmetic things you get like go away.

314
00:21:32,382 --> 00:21:38,800
Scott: So it's like you can get a fancy costume But you can don't like a Halloween costume that only works on Halloween and then it goes away and you can't get it again.

315
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:39,386
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

316
00:21:39,891 --> 00:21:40,760
Scott: why would you pay money?

317
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,770
Scott: Why would anyone pay money for that when it's like?

318
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,640
Scott: I feel like you know this?

319
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:45,462
Scott: I don't.

320
00:21:45,502 --> 00:21:48,480
Scott: if I knew how it worked I could make a better commentary on it.

321
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:59,246
Scott: But I feel like they probably could have just not done stupid shit like that and people might have wanted Yeah, cuz I counter-strike as its equivalent really want them But the variant cards in Marvel snap.

322
00:21:59,286 --> 00:22:01,132
Scott: people really want the hats and tf2.

323
00:22:01,172 --> 00:22:05,659
Scott: people really want the skins on guns and counter-strike that They'll gamble with them and spent piles of money for them.

324
00:22:06,282 --> 00:22:09,275
Scott: Why wouldn't people really want cosmetic shit in dota - yeah.

325
00:22:09,818 --> 00:22:10,300
Rym: and meanwhile?

326
00:22:11,584 --> 00:22:17,159
Rym: Something was wrong definitely has similar stuff And I assume people are buying those because they didn't cut that.

327
00:22:17,601 --> 00:22:21,800
Rym: But no, I know a little bit about how the counter-strike ones work, and they're absolute garbage.

328
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,044
Rym: There's nothing there like.

329
00:22:23,084 --> 00:22:25,552
Rym: the cosmetics are really sad, and I can't know.

330
00:22:25,592 --> 00:22:31,697
Scott: I think the only reason people want the counters for the gamblings Because they're literally worth money to somebody.

331
00:22:31,758 --> 00:22:33,406
Scott: therefore They're worth money to like.

332
00:22:33,467 --> 00:22:40,732
Scott: if someone's gonna spend a thousand dollars for one and suddenly Everyone else wants one because they think they can sell it and get a thousand They don't want the skins they want the thousand dollars.

333
00:22:40,752 --> 00:22:48,469
Rym: fact late last year Scott and I were talking about selling old crap in the valve like steam marketplace And I was poo-pooing it because I didn't want to spend.

334
00:22:48,529 --> 00:22:51,560
Scott: I bought a lot of Marvel snap stuff selling young car.

335
00:22:51,781 --> 00:23:00,345
Rym: I didn't want to click even once if it was just gonna get me like a cent or two But I did go look and I had a counter-strike skin that was worth like 20 bucks And I sold it and someone

336
00:23:00,686 --> 00:23:01,047
Scott: someone

337
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:07,050
Rym: paid like 19 real Dollars for a skin.

338
00:23:07,291 --> 00:23:09,679
Scott: that valve took a cut and you got the rest.

339
00:23:09,699 --> 00:23:09,860
Rym: yeah.

340
00:23:10,282 --> 00:23:13,080
Rym: So I got like 16 bucks for nothing.

341
00:23:14,141 --> 00:23:16,130
Scott: Yep, literally nothing for playing counter-strike.

342
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:17,456
Scott: They paid you to play counter-strike.

343
00:23:17,476 --> 00:23:28,530
Scott: Yeah And click a button afterwards But anyway things of the day.

344
00:23:28,771 --> 00:23:29,694
Rym: So what do you got?

345
00:23:29,755 --> 00:23:33,770
Rym: because I thought you had something different until I actually clicked on this link, and this is way better.

346
00:23:34,433 --> 00:23:42,023
Scott: I'm sure this is old news to many, but it was new news to me that apparently Yellowstone National Park, you know the place where Yogi Bear is from right?

347
00:23:42,043 --> 00:23:43,470
Scott: Yeah, I guess Jellystone is.

348
00:23:45,054 --> 00:23:46,220
Scott: You know I knew that it was.

349
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:52,870
Scott: I knew it's general geography But I didn't know it's specific geography and that it takes up a lot of a big chunk of Wyoming.

350
00:23:53,051 --> 00:24:04,630
Scott: But it actually takes this sliver in Montana on the north and west sides And also takes this tiny sliver and the southwest in Idaho right and but most of its in Wyoming right?

351
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:11,027
Scott: It's basically the northwest corner of Wyoming But a sliver of Montana and a little like an l-shape and a sliver in Idaho.

352
00:24:11,729 --> 00:24:14,809
Scott: now There's a in the u.s.. Right the the law is.

353
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:24,437
Scott: Constitution says that you know if you commit some crimes there in a national federal land that you States can't do anything about that.

354
00:24:24,498 --> 00:24:27,108
Scott: That's a federal crime for federal courts to deal with.

355
00:24:27,229 --> 00:24:29,296
Rym: yeah This comes up a lot in DC.

356
00:24:29,356 --> 00:24:31,735
Rym: Which is not in any state exactly.

357
00:24:31,795 --> 00:24:43,850
Scott: now if you also You know commit a federal crime you have to go to federal court Which is one of those district courts, and you obviously there's a district court that covers any spot.

358
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:45,490
Scott: You are in the US and its territories.

359
00:24:45,591 --> 00:24:47,988
Scott: There's gonna be a district court that covers that area.

360
00:24:48,049 --> 00:24:53,470
Scott: yeah If for some reason there wasn't which there is that you could I guess avoid, but there is right.

361
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:59,350
Scott: So the district that covers that area right is in Wyoming obviously?

362
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:15,789
Scott: and The thing is is that you also when you go to federal court you need to get a jury and the people on that jury Have to live in that district right and they also have to live in the same state where you did the crime.

363
00:25:16,572 --> 00:25:27,340
Scott: So if you do a crime so you rob a pick a nick a basket Yellowstone, Wyoming right well There's people who live in the district and also in Wyoming.

364
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:30,610
Scott: not a lot of them, but enough to make a jury right there's.

365
00:25:31,532 --> 00:25:31,753
Rym: There's.

366
00:25:32,014 --> 00:25:35,444
Rym: there's nine angry people who just live there the only people they're on.

367
00:25:35,484 --> 00:25:43,183
Scott: if you go to that little sliver in Montana right It's like there are a few people living there.

368
00:25:43,304 --> 00:25:45,110
Scott: There's like in those inhabited areas.

369
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:47,599
Scott: it would be tough to make a jury, but they could.

370
00:25:47,719 --> 00:25:49,124
Scott: there's enough people right.

371
00:25:49,204 --> 00:25:55,883
Scott: someone did a crime there and They basically plead on the condition that they don't try to fight this condition.

372
00:25:56,104 --> 00:26:00,295
Scott: right, but the sliver in Idaho No one lives there.

373
00:26:00,937 --> 00:26:01,378
Scott: No one.

374
00:26:01,719 --> 00:26:11,890
Scott: so even though there are people living in the district in Wyoming You commit the crime in the Idaho part of Yellowstone Park where no one lives except a bear right?

375
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,828
Scott: We can't be on a jury because he's not your peer.

376
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:22,070
Scott: There's no one to make a jury because no one lives in Idaho and also in the district in which the court is.

377
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:30,590
Scott: So it's called the zone of death because theoretically You could kill someone there and get away with it because it's this note.

378
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,609
Scott: They could never make a jury to do anything about it.

379
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:38,770
Scott: Yeah, but it's only like one person wrote a work of like a short story or something where this happened.

380
00:26:38,991 --> 00:26:43,227
Rym: There was one case with a poacher that tested this but that was it.

381
00:26:43,247 --> 00:26:44,010
Scott: that was in the Montana.

382
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:52,156
Rym: It was only a few people but even worse the Idaho part has no people but even that one It looks like in the end.

383
00:26:52,176 --> 00:26:53,721
Rym: They never got appealed up.

384
00:26:54,042 --> 00:26:54,845
Scott: I said that already.

385
00:26:54,865 --> 00:26:56,510
Scott: Yes, so it was about that.

386
00:26:56,751 --> 00:27:00,068
Rym: So we mentioned the whole thing, but our religion is record never got to rule out it.

387
00:27:01,126 --> 00:27:04,609
Scott: Yeah Yeah, they made them plea on the condition that they wouldn't fight it.

388
00:27:06,395 --> 00:27:07,814
Rym: I Someone's got some day.

389
00:27:07,894 --> 00:27:08,837
Rym: I would love to see it.

390
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,730
Scott: Well, hopefully no one kills anyone except maybe Yogi bear.

391
00:27:13,071 --> 00:27:16,843
Rym: But we got to go there and go run a casino not being killed.

392
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:22,030
Scott: Oh Or this is bling in the zone.

393
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:24,293
Rym: Piracy.

394
00:27:24,353 --> 00:27:26,141
Rym: run the run the pirate bay there.

395
00:27:26,181 --> 00:27:28,050
Rym: hide a server in the woods with the satellite uplink.

396
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:31,294
Rym: Mmm, that's how you do this.

397
00:27:31,335 --> 00:27:32,077
Rym: forget zone of death.

398
00:27:32,137 --> 00:27:35,827
Scott: Yeah, let's do some moral morally acceptable crime.

399
00:27:35,907 --> 00:27:41,803
Rym: an underground bunker Hundreds and hundreds of petabytes of pirated streaming media.

400
00:27:42,385 --> 00:27:48,795
Scott: billionaire graveyard Hey suck, I got.

401
00:27:48,815 --> 00:27:51,226
Scott: you know, hey musk I got this cool place you got to check out.

402
00:27:51,246 --> 00:27:52,130
Scott: we can do your fight here.

403
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,375
Scott: Come on, it'll be really.

404
00:27:53,395 --> 00:27:54,941
Scott: we don't have to worry about gambling commissions.

405
00:27:54,961 --> 00:27:55,724
Scott: We can fight here.

406
00:27:56,426 --> 00:27:57,250
Scott: No one will stop you.

407
00:27:57,491 --> 00:27:58,718
Rym: Yeah, you can both fight dirty.

408
00:27:58,778 --> 00:27:59,402
Rym: convince them both.

409
00:27:59,462 --> 00:28:00,649
Rym: It's a real good idea for them.

410
00:28:01,771 --> 00:28:12,062
Rym: Yeah So, uh, my thing of the day is real short, this is an eight-second YouTube video and I Saw it and it looked like the cute kind of thing.

411
00:28:12,143 --> 00:28:12,826
Rym: I would like like.

412
00:28:12,866 --> 00:28:19,230
Rym: it's a random YouTube video I would click on but I did not Expect it to be about what it was about and I laughed out loud when I saw it.

413
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:21,609
Rym: It was cute enough to where I think everyone should see this.

414
00:28:21,891 --> 00:28:22,092
Rym: It was.

415
00:28:22,132 --> 00:28:24,465
Scott: I don't know who thought of this, but they're pretty genius.

416
00:28:24,566 --> 00:28:25,250
Scott: It was pretty good.

417
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:29,644
Rym: I kept posting it around because if you click on it, you're like, all right spider-man joking.

418
00:28:29,664 --> 00:28:31,008
Rym: They're like, oh, haha.

419
00:28:31,068 --> 00:28:33,644
Rym: That's cute Spider-man, it's spider-man.

420
00:28:34,874 --> 00:28:46,318
Scott: Also as I guess one more spider-man note I only recently realized all the spider-man multiverse OSTs are on your favorite streaming services As well as some official remix album.

421
00:28:46,378 --> 00:28:50,709
Rym: Yeah, cuz we both we both realized we've all realized simultaneously that we really like elephant sounds.

422
00:28:53,227 --> 00:28:59,774
Scott: Oh Once you realize how many elephant sounds are in those movies you won't unhear them In the meta moment.

423
00:28:59,814 --> 00:29:01,580
Rym: the GeekNights book club book is.

00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,270
Rym: I did not because I've been busy doing other stuff.

438
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:39,884

439
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:47,407
Rym: read it after dinner Maybe me or maybe a pleasant afternoon at most if you're a slow reader, but what one?

440
00:29:47,588 --> 00:29:48,270
Scott: one or two beaches?

441

445
00:29:57,252 --> 00:30:04,836
Rym: Otherwise, we will be in the other meta on Sunday with a actually all-new panel Details TBD.

446
00:30:04,856 --> 00:30:05,921
Rym: you'll see an update soon.

447
00:30:06,302 --> 00:30:07,367
Rym: got some thoughts on the panel?

448
00:30:07,387 --> 00:30:07,890
Rym: be a fun one.

449
00:30:08,231 --> 00:30:13,186
Rym: We also have some pretty good ideas for some unplugged content that I think you would all appreciate.

450
00:30:13,447 --> 00:30:14,370
Rym: so stay tuned for that.

451
00:30:14,883 --> 00:30:19,183
Rym: But Ignites panels live stuff YouTube videos lectures.

452
00:30:19,223 --> 00:30:25,575
Rym: It's all coming back baby kick knives back in the real world and Gonna get right into it.

453
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:33,339
Rym: because this you might remember way way back in 2011 2012. this was a long time ago.

454
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:36,710
Rym: We did a panel in the tiny tiny panel room.

455
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:45,996
Rym: This was a PAX East where we did three panels, but two of the panels were in this tiny workshop room Seated like 100 people tiny tiny little room.

456
00:30:46,337 --> 00:30:51,755
Rym: and we did two back-to-back panels that we didn't think would be super popular compared to our big stuff.

457
00:30:51,837 --> 00:30:58,021
Rym: one was called Mastering game mechanics and one was called practically in theory People line the fuck up to see mastering game mechanics.

458
00:30:58,061 --> 00:31:00,210
Rym: almost no one got to see it in the room completely packed.

459
00:31:00,613 --> 00:31:07,064
Rym: but mastering game mechanics was about Game mechanics, like let's talk about a bunch of game mechanics and explain their deal.

460
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:10,097
Rym: and Scott had the brilliant idea Why don't we do a show?

461
00:31:10,117 --> 00:31:16,330
Rym: it's easy easy content farm idea Yeah, but it's such a good idea because we got a lot to say about this time.

462
00:31:16,952 --> 00:31:22,447
Scott: Let's just do one panel slash episode slash whatever each video for each game mechanical.

463
00:31:22,467 --> 00:31:23,530
Scott: break it down even more.

464
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,197
Scott: Yeah, you can go deep go deeper.

465
00:31:25,398 --> 00:31:29,705
Scott: instead of doing all these game mechanics and one in one shot We'll just do one at a time.

466
00:31:29,725 --> 00:31:33,650
Scott: Yeah And the right of ideas, that's what I got.

467
00:31:34,352 --> 00:31:39,430
Rym: But worker placement seemed like a good one to start with partly because I we have a lot of thoughts about it.

468
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:39,832
Rym: It's all.

469
00:31:39,932 --> 00:31:40,737
Rym: that's a game mechanic.

470
00:31:40,757 --> 00:31:41,059
Rym: I like.

471
00:31:41,341 --> 00:32:03,888
Rym: but I also realized something important because the problem with talking about game mechanics is that it's very easy to say that any X-act thing in a game could arguably be classified as a bunch of different kinds of game mechanics based on how you look at it, like you could argue that a lot of things in games are Effectively worker placement, even if they don't look like it.

472
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:07,030
Rym: So I want to get out of the way that I think we can do something clever.

473
00:32:07,535 --> 00:32:13,350
Rym: It's the same thing you do in math Where you multiply something by one to make it look different for the purposes of a conversation.

474
00:32:14,093 --> 00:32:27,290
Rym: I think even if a mechanic could arguably be worker placement in effect to talk about it as worker placement We should multiply it by one so that it looks like worker placement to have the conversation.

475
00:32:27,693 --> 00:32:29,749
Rym: Then we were always talking about it the same way.

476
00:32:30,473 --> 00:32:37,059
Scott: Well, I think one of the things is that a lot of people, you know Can't align game mechanics with each other so easily.

477
00:32:37,641 --> 00:32:44,901
Scott: even me I have a problem because especially tabletop You'll have the same mechanic implemented with different components.

478
00:32:45,122 --> 00:32:48,090
Scott: Yeah, that will confuse like physical components, right?

479
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:50,990
Scott: So it's like someone would be like, oh no, this is a card game.

480
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:54,790
Scott: Look, I'm playing cards and someone's like well putting a meeple on a space.

481
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:56,537
Scott: That's not the same thing as playing a card.

482
00:32:56,597 --> 00:33:00,633
Rym: arguably action and worker placement are the exact same thing Right.

483
00:33:00,674 --> 00:33:04,490
Scott: It's like if they're mathematically equivalent if they're functionally equivalent.

484
00:33:04,731 --> 00:33:07,750
Scott: If you if you make the game into just a spreadsheet, right?

485
00:33:08,291 --> 00:33:10,599
Scott: Is it the same in on the spreadsheet?

486
00:33:10,699 --> 00:33:13,910
Scott: and it's like if it is the same on the spreadsheet then is the same game mechanic?

487
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:18,504
Scott: Regardless of you know, rolling a dive or spinning a spinner verse.

488
00:33:18,524 --> 00:33:20,390
Scott: They're all RNG on the spreadsheet, right?

489
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:22,995
Scott: So they're all the same mechanic that way.

490
00:33:23,035 --> 00:33:35,630
Rym: Yeah, but at the same time Worker placement is something I think that's very easy to engage with because this concept like a lot of the games We like the most use worker placement as a primary mechanic.

491
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:39,440
Rym: It's often the primary mechanic of a game.

492
00:33:40,104 --> 00:33:40,306
Scott: Yep.

493
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:41,092
Scott: All right.

494
00:33:41,112 --> 00:33:42,220
Scott: So what is worker placement?

495
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:50,021
Scott: So worker placement is you have a game and there are a set of actions that a player may take on their turn Right.

496
00:33:50,181 --> 00:33:59,378
Scott: Usually those are the only things players do in the game are this set of actions and you can choose some subset of those actions to perform.

497
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:15,250
Scott: as You know your as your agency in the game is basically choosing which of those actions you will take in which order when the opportunity presents itself to you the player right and Typically for a worker placement game, right?

498
00:34:15,591 --> 00:34:28,340
Scott: The actions will usually almost definitely be Exclusive or at least limited so that when you choose to take an action You will also be denying other players from taking that action at least for the that turn.

499
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,444
Rym: I think that's our future.

500
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:39,980
Scott: very good way to define it because that right because if everyone can take all the same actions That's a cut that fundamentally changes like everything that is just action drafting or action points.

501
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,304
Rym: Like action drafting.

502
00:34:41,364 --> 00:34:46,360
Rym: action points are almost a superset worker placement to put some constraints on it, right?

503
00:34:46,721 --> 00:34:50,179
Scott: But it's like such a significant constraint that it makes it a completely different game.

504
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:52,408
Scott: Definitely all the heuristics are different.

505
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:56,864
Rym: all the wit everything's did like about every worker placement games Most people know like Agricola.

506
00:34:57,126 --> 00:35:00,900
Rym: Yeah, if I put my guy on the baby, you can't make a baby this round.

507
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:01,806
Rym: That's that's the game.

508
00:35:01,987 --> 00:35:03,416
Rym: is who gets the baby first exact.

509
00:35:03,436 --> 00:35:03,979
Scott: That's the whole game.

510
00:35:04,251 --> 00:35:10,140
Scott: Yeah Which is a lot of work or at least some limit right like only two people there's only two spots on that action.

511
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:14,455
Scott: It's three spots on that action and that action has infinity spots and that one has only one spot.

512
00:35:14,515 --> 00:35:20,960
Rym: sometimes as long as there's some Sometimes you get the limit is is more abstract or different like a limit.

513
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,209
Rym: I've seen games where I'd still think this is worker placement.

514
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:29,009
Rym: the first person to go there gets the good version But all the second person gets the crappy version.

515
00:35:29,049 --> 00:35:30,835
Scott: third person can't get anything exactly.

516
00:35:30,855 --> 00:35:32,039
Scott: Yeah, I've seen that.

517
00:35:33,434 --> 00:35:41,772
Scott: So yeah It's there's some set of actions and on your basic the main thing that players do is Choose which of those actions they all perform.

518
00:35:41,812 --> 00:35:43,280
Scott: Yeah, and that's a worker placement game.

519
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:52,920
Rym: I think it I think it is drizz lens itself toward Being a primary mechanic in a game as opposed to something that is just there in a much bigger game.

520
00:35:53,262 --> 00:35:53,664
Rym: There aren't.

521
00:35:54,086 --> 00:35:56,259
Rym: there aren't that many good games where?

522
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,840
Rym: Placing workers is one of many actions you can take like that turns into those turn into salad games pretty quickly and get weird.

523
00:36:04,041 --> 00:36:08,636
Rym: I feel like most of the games that I would consider good personally that include worker placement.

524
00:36:08,897 --> 00:36:13,020
Rym: worker placement is Primary or it's very prominent in the game.

525
00:36:13,742 --> 00:36:19,546
Scott: Yeah, I mean you could just have like a little sideshow where it's like, okay you play this whole game That's actually somewhere else.

526
00:36:19,626 --> 00:36:25,347
Scott: and then one of the bonus parts of the game is like, you know You have these workers that you put into spots, right?

527
00:36:25,408 --> 00:36:25,688
Scott: It's like.

528
00:36:26,009 --> 00:36:34,013
Scott: but choosing workers to go into spots, even though it's a simple mechanic It's easy to understand you can teach it to anyone pretty quickly right?

529
00:36:34,093 --> 00:36:36,280
Scott: even people aren't super gamer II, right?

530
00:36:36,822 --> 00:36:38,719
Scott: It's that those choices are.

531
00:36:39,743 --> 00:36:42,451
Scott: So there's so much that goes into those choices.

532
00:36:42,551 --> 00:36:55,560
Scott: if you're actually trying right that It takes so much of your cognitive energies Even in such an even in a simple worker placement game right that you can't be having that as a sideshow.

533
00:36:55,702 --> 00:36:56,819
Scott: It needs to be the focus.

534
00:36:57,463 --> 00:37:05,697
Scott: Otherwise, it's just sort of a pain in the ass like ah I got to do figure out all this just for the side bit for ten bonus point over here.

535
00:37:05,718 --> 00:37:07,394
Scott: Yeah, right It's like not work.

536
00:37:07,414 --> 00:37:07,840
Rym: No, that's right.

537
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:16,320
Rym: I'd also have to say I would actually put another constraint on it because there's I forget what it's called But in like Hansa to a tonic, uh, you can put the worker or the token in the place.

538
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,454
Rym: They get you victory points and there's a limited number of them.

539
00:37:18,535 --> 00:37:19,280
Rym: There is a constraint.

540
00:37:19,522 --> 00:37:20,835
Rym: It looks like worker placement.

541
00:37:20,855 --> 00:37:21,360
Rym: in some ways.

542
00:37:21,986 --> 00:37:31,786
Rym: I would argue that if The only actions the only result of placing workers is victory points or an equivalent as opposed to other Impacts to the game.

543
00:37:31,846 --> 00:37:32,793
Rym: It's not worker placement.

544
00:37:32,813 --> 00:37:33,518
Rym: That's something different.

545
00:37:34,584 --> 00:37:41,494
Rym: Yeah, now if there is a worker location that gets you a victory point But there's other worker locations that do something else mechanically.

546
00:37:41,514 --> 00:37:45,528
Rym: I think that's fine But if they only get you victory points, it's not worker placement.

547
00:37:45,869 --> 00:37:48,518
Rym: It's something else that I'd struggle to come up with a name for.

548
00:37:49,521 --> 00:37:54,675
Scott: Yeah, so the the first worker like the first game that we knew was worker placement.

549
00:37:54,715 --> 00:37:59,520
Scott: like when we played it and I think Historically, we're still trying to figure out is Kayla's right?

550
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:03,980
Rym: Yep, Kayla's was my I literally encountered the concept of worker placement.

551
00:38:04,881 --> 00:38:06,550
Rym: That was one of the early German board games.

552
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:07,073
Rym: We got into.

553
00:38:07,093 --> 00:38:08,400
Rym: I spent a lot of money in that fucking game.

554
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,685
Rym: Or did you one of us bought it?

555
00:38:09,705 --> 00:38:14,866
Scott: I had I think you bought it when it was Brent when it was brand new There was a big a big rave about it.

556
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:15,929
Scott: Yeah, I bought it.

557
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,900
Rym: I bought El Grande early and and Decker.

558
00:38:20,361 --> 00:38:22,307
Scott: Yeah, so the thing is so.

559
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:25,316
Scott: you came at this like one of the first ones if not the first one.

560
00:38:25,396 --> 00:38:28,559
Rym: bus is arguably the First one which I hadn't played it away later.

561
00:38:29,302 --> 00:38:35,120
Scott: So what introduced right as sort of this the the features of the worker placement, right?

562
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:35,682
Scott: Was that?

563
00:38:36,083 --> 00:38:40,400
Scott: you know, obviously you only had a few a limited number of workers, right?

564
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:44,736
Scott: I don't think there was a way to get more and Kayla's I think just everyone had the same number, right?

565
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:49,289
Scott: I think so Yeah, but it definitely had the okay.

566
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:53,380
Scott: certain actions sort of go together and overlap a little bit.

567
00:38:53,861 --> 00:38:55,326
Scott: But there are like these Pat.

568
00:38:55,366 --> 00:39:00,020
Scott: there are some that like you said generate victory points that have certain inputs, right?

569
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:13,020
Scott: It was like some of them generate resources and then some of them shift resources and some of them turn resources into victory points, and so you basically Had to sort of pick which of the victory point ones you were gonna go for it.

570
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:25,020
Scott: There was like a jewelry one and the castle right and the favors and so you couldn't with the number of workers You had you couldn't you do all these things at once right or at least not.

571
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:31,007
Scott: Well, you had to pick one to really go for big time And I think that sort of holds true.

572
00:39:31,027 --> 00:39:36,384
Scott: and basically even though worker placement games have way different shapes You know how many years?

573
00:39:36,384 --> 00:39:40,739
Scott: 10 to 20 almost how many years of development since then?

574
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:47,678
Scott: That that sort of still holds true and that you know, there's different the the the actions sort of.

575
00:39:47,979 --> 00:40:05,099
Scott: you know Different paths and you're trying to combine sets of actions together That don't overlap the other players because then you end up blocking each other and not getting ahead so much But then lead to one of this, you know being able to play the strong actions that actually win the game.

576
00:40:05,963 --> 00:40:10,360
Rym: Now I think another interesting discussion point and we can't be exhaustive here.

577
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:13,677
Rym: I don't think even in multiple panels or writing a book we could be exhaustive.

578
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:23,135
Rym: but Much like how trick-taking games or trick-taking is a mechanic We there's like different characteristics like must follow suit versus may follow suit.

579
00:40:23,315 --> 00:40:24,017
Rym: are there Trump's?

580
00:40:24,077 --> 00:40:24,960
Rym: are there multiple trumps?

581
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:49,339
Rym: there are a lot of characteristics that in combination are what I think make worker placement so compelling because I Bet there's at least 30 or 40 unique definable Characteristics that could be applied to worker placement and every few games have the exact same Characteristics together because I think they tend to become very likely the same game if they do that.

582
00:40:50,262 --> 00:40:54,900
Rym: One example would be are all of the player worker of the places workers can go?

583
00:40:55,362 --> 00:40:56,990
Rym: Are they all available from the start?

584
00:40:57,332 --> 00:40:58,819
Rym: are they revealed in some way?

585
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,718
Rym: Are they ownable by players in some way?

586
00:41:02,342 --> 00:41:05,258
Rym: Like do I put a worker on the board and I get a baby?

587
00:41:05,278 --> 00:41:09,576
Rym: or Does Scott build a place and if I put a worker there Scott gets a dollar?

588
00:41:09,917 --> 00:41:10,620
Rym: those are red.

589
00:41:11,021 --> 00:41:15,275
Scott: Some games allow players to like choose what the available actions will be.

590
00:41:15,335 --> 00:41:20,000
Scott: like you have cards in your hand Yeah, like and you play the card, right?

591
00:41:20,481 --> 00:41:22,660
Scott: And now that card is now an action.

592
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:28,340
Scott: So you're choosing which actions are available to everyone or choosing which actions are available to yourself.

593
00:41:28,581 --> 00:41:29,966
Scott: Right rather than just.

594
00:41:30,308 --> 00:41:35,647
Scott: here's a set of actions that are pre-prescribed by the game and That's it right Agricola.

595
00:41:35,768 --> 00:41:40,239
Scott: They're pre-prescribed, but the order they come out They're available in is slightly randomized.

596
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,866
Scott: Hey, this game is a little bit different.

597
00:41:41,886 --> 00:41:49,099
Rym: a player will build the building and that's a worker placement spot But also they get a privilege if they use it and other players have to pay them if they use it.

598
00:41:50,060 --> 00:42:01,180
Scott: Yep, another characteristic kinds of variations on the controlling of what are the actions right some permanent actions some random actions Right because you know a game might not work is like you might have a bad deal.

599
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:07,931
Scott: We're like all none of all the if you randomize just everything it's like well No one can play the game because no there's no basic action available.

600
00:42:07,972 --> 00:42:11,887
Rym: Yeah, there's no way to get wood wood powers everything else Softlock you need to have.

601
00:42:12,068 --> 00:42:14,140
Scott: usually you need to have some sort of basic area.

602
00:42:14,222 --> 00:42:17,649
Scott: That's like yes This action is always available in the game no matter what.

603
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:21,906
Scott: so you can no matter what happens you can play and I think that Is a common mechanic.

604
00:42:22,086 --> 00:42:27,540
Rym: most worker placement games I can think of off the top of my head have like Some base things like Everdell.

605
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:32,388
Rym: There's the base actions that are like get some wood and then there's the advanced stuff And then there's the win.

606
00:42:32,408 --> 00:42:33,115
Rym: more stuff like.

607
00:42:33,135 --> 00:42:35,746
Rym: there's different Classes of the types of actions you could take.

608
00:42:35,786 --> 00:42:40,019
Rym: win more tends to be a pile of victory points instead of an in-game advantage.

609
00:42:41,581 --> 00:42:43,045
Rym: Another aspect is the immediacy.

610
00:42:43,266 --> 00:42:46,194
Rym: like some games put a worker out get the thing.

611
00:42:46,735 --> 00:42:52,633
Rym: other games put a worker out Next turn or at some point in the future the worker comes back with the thing.

612
00:42:53,014 --> 00:43:00,319
Rym: some games worker stays there Even after you got the odd like after the thing happened until some future event happens.

613
00:43:02,282 --> 00:43:05,253
Scott: Yep, yeah, it's all kinds of stuff like that, so it's like you're managing right?

614
00:43:05,393 --> 00:43:07,360
Scott: you know how do you have workers available?

615
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,558
Scott: You know do you throw them out too early?

616
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,164
Scott: You hold on to them too long?

617
00:43:11,184 --> 00:43:20,137
Scott: you could have gotten more stuff right, but I think you know the majority of these games Right are games in which you put a worker to get stuff right there.

618
00:43:20,198 --> 00:43:32,166
Scott: resource Collections as well, but worker placement does not have to be Resource collection even though the majority of tabletop games that are worker placement games are Resource collecting games.

619
00:43:32,206 --> 00:43:38,585
Scott: for example you could make Tetris, and there are Three actions.

620
00:43:38,725 --> 00:43:45,402
Scott: actually there's flip left flip right slam it down and Like.

621
00:43:45,583 --> 00:43:45,984
Scott: is that it?

622
00:43:46,366 --> 00:43:50,520
Scott: oh no the next right you know swap put the piece in the storage right.

623
00:43:50,821 --> 00:43:51,945
Scott: So those are your four actions.

624
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:58,967
Scott: now imagine playing a Tetris where you've got like two workers Right and those are your four choices.

625
00:43:59,489 --> 00:43:59,750
Scott: right.

626
00:44:00,031 --> 00:44:04,167
Scott: and now it's not a resource collection game anymore But it sure is the worker.

627
00:44:04,248 --> 00:44:06,015
Scott: Oh move left and move right those you need.

628
00:44:06,055 --> 00:44:10,169
Scott: those also right yeah And maybe I'll give you three workers with this.

629
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:13,365
Scott: so it's like you know and you got to choose Right.

630
00:44:13,445 --> 00:44:16,119
Scott: it's like that could be considered a worker placement game.

631
00:44:17,381 --> 00:44:18,185
Scott: You're really limited.

632
00:44:18,245 --> 00:44:23,520
Scott: you might not be able to put the piece in the spot you want because You know yeah work right?

633
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:26,819
Scott: It's like maybe I draw a piece that I want to put in the left side of my board.

634
00:44:27,301 --> 00:44:29,831
Scott: Rym draws a piece he wants to put in the left side of his Tetris board.

635
00:44:29,851 --> 00:44:32,119
Scott: I go first and I move mine left.

636
00:44:32,782 --> 00:44:35,758
Scott: Rym's got to now find a place to put his piece on the right or the middle.

637
00:44:35,778 --> 00:44:38,782
Scott: yeah Trouble.

638
00:44:39,003 --> 00:44:40,994
Rym: and there's also you know one at one common thing.

639
00:44:41,014 --> 00:44:55,269
Rym: I'm thinking about is that Typically the danger of designing a worker placement game is if your game allows for players to get more workers that Tends to be overpowered and it is rare.

640
00:44:55,670 --> 00:45:04,600
Rym: There is a game that successfully navigates that challenge without Giving everyone more workers or having extreme constraints on more workers.

641
00:45:05,721 --> 00:45:13,247
Scott: Well, I think one thing I've thought about that in the past right is that it's sort of obvious right like okay Taking at if all the actions don't change.

642
00:45:13,307 --> 00:45:15,132
Scott: the actions are what they are right.

643
00:45:15,393 --> 00:45:20,709
Scott: so being able to do more of them is like Taking more turns than other players, and that's just.

644
00:45:20,769 --> 00:45:25,987
Scott: it's obvious that like no matter what other rules there are in your game Taking actions is good.

645
00:45:26,007 --> 00:45:27,193
Scott: There's never.

646
00:45:27,213 --> 00:45:27,875
Scott: there's no action.

647
00:45:27,896 --> 00:45:28,940
Scott: That's like hurt myself.

648
00:45:30,762 --> 00:45:40,493
Scott: Every action brings you closer to victory so taking more actions is Necessarily more powerful than anything else that you could possibly conceive of.

649
00:45:40,533 --> 00:45:46,369
Scott: so games that allow you to get more workers Agricola right it's like you are aiming for.

650
00:45:46,409 --> 00:45:50,280
Scott: that is above all else right strategically right.

651
00:45:50,360 --> 00:46:02,895
Scott: But I do think there is an interesting design to be had where you could Scale the actions be give everyone ten workers right like go wild everyone.

652
00:46:02,915 --> 00:46:13,713
Scott: you get ten workers right but If you the how strong each action is will be Proportional to the total number of workers you choose to use.

653
00:46:14,054 --> 00:46:20,054
Scott: so if you put one worker on gather wood And that's it that's effectively the same as having all ten workers gather wood.

654
00:46:20,315 --> 00:46:23,485
Scott: therefore you get a fuck Simple makeup rules.

655
00:46:23,525 --> 00:46:24,368
Rym: now you get ten wood.

656
00:46:24,589 --> 00:46:28,088
Rym: if I put two workers out one on wood and one on stone I get five Wood and five stone.

657
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,300
Rym: put ten workers out.

658
00:46:30,582 --> 00:46:35,040
Scott: So it's like you can choose how many workers to place and how many things you want to do.

659
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:38,131
Scott: but the more you do the shittier you do each one.

660
00:46:38,151 --> 00:46:40,660
Scott: and then now you sort of solve that problem of.

661
00:46:41,901 --> 00:46:42,182
Scott: You know.

662
00:46:42,363 --> 00:46:45,092
Scott: okay, you know having more workers is just better.

663
00:46:45,112 --> 00:46:45,674
Rym: I can't think of it.

664
00:46:45,714 --> 00:46:46,116
Rym: does that?

665
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:46,216
Rym: no

666
00:46:47,441 --> 00:46:59,647
Scott: I can't think of any game that does that either But at the same time you're still giving the players the choices of okay You don't need to do that many different things for your strategy because you've thought of a way to get by with just a few Types of actions.

667
00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:01,960
Scott: good you'll boost all those actions.

668
00:47:02,545 --> 00:47:04,118
Scott: Oh, you thought of a way to do.

669
00:47:04,178 --> 00:47:06,207
Scott: well But it requires diversification.

670
00:47:06,588 --> 00:47:12,330
Scott: you can diversify a whole lot and get all kinds of stuff going on But you're gonna do each of those things more weekly.

671
00:47:12,752 --> 00:47:20,830
Scott: so you're better take advantage of that Diversification to get ahead of the person who's only got a few things But has a lot of them now right and that could even out.

672
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:22,838
Scott: if you did the math properly it would be still be fair.

673
00:47:23,824 --> 00:47:30,780
Rym: Two other ways to address that one I've seen and One I haven't but I have an example from what I would argue is not a worker placement game.

674
00:47:31,061 --> 00:47:38,083
Rym: what I've seen is you can get more workers, but either there is an extreme cost to that or Workers have to.

675
00:47:38,324 --> 00:47:40,750
Rym: there's some cost to placing a worker.

676
00:47:41,051 --> 00:47:46,710
Rym: thus having more workers has a higher burn rate of your Resources and that could be tuned and balanced.

677
00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:47,835
Scott: I've seen I mean a grickle.

678
00:47:47,875 --> 00:47:52,353
Scott: you have to feed your family Appropriately though they don't they don't scale it well.

679
00:47:52,413 --> 00:47:58,291
Rym: having another worker is So much better and so much more valuable than any amount of eating you have.

680
00:47:58,311 --> 00:47:58,672
Scott: because?

681
00:47:58,953 --> 00:48:05,880
Rym: well because inherently for that mechanic to work Right I think you need more workers and more stuff going on for that mechanic to work well.

682
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:06,784
Scott: So here's the thing right.

683
00:48:06,845 --> 00:48:09,920
Scott: it's like let's say you need X resources to like maintain a work.

684
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:10,704
Scott: Yeah, right.

685
00:48:11,146 --> 00:48:24,413
Scott: so therefore even if you have just one worker And that's it You still need the game has to be structured in such a way that the one worker can produce enough stuff to maintain themselves and Also more than that right.

686
00:48:24,796 --> 00:48:29,437
Scott: therefore Having ten workers will also produce enough to feed the ten workers.

687
00:48:29,497 --> 00:48:33,479
Rym: the board is Constrained or there's something else going on where you don't with you.

688
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:36,809
Rym: You know you need multiple currencies multiple resources would need.

689
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:49,822
Scott: you would need to make the cost to maintain a worker Exponential Relative to the number of workers so that cost it so that the maintenance for ten workers isn't just ten times the maintenance of one Worker.

690
00:48:50,243 --> 00:48:52,332
Scott: it would be like you know one to like.

691
00:48:52,472 --> 00:48:53,898
Scott: you know some power right.

692
00:48:53,918 --> 00:48:54,280
Scott: so that way.

693
00:48:54,621 --> 00:49:05,535
Scott: But then even if you did that everyone could just do the math and realize oh if I have five workers That's the sweet spot where they produce more The margins they produce versus.

694
00:49:05,596 --> 00:49:12,077
Rym: I feel like you're right Like a Pareto frontier of like three four or five workers in this particular game are the good ones.

695
00:49:12,318 --> 00:49:15,207
Rym: more than that You're very likely going to lose less than that.

696
00:49:15,308 --> 00:49:19,627
Scott: having a very likely having a cost on the workers is basically just Setting.

697
00:49:19,667 --> 00:49:25,915
Scott: you might as well just say okay Well the limit is five because buying six workers now they cost more to have than to use.

698
00:49:26,316 --> 00:49:27,660
Scott: so why would anyone ever get it?

699
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:42,073
Rym: So I think it's possible, but it requires very good design and balance and requires likely Multiple independent currencies and some worker actions might require One or more resources from those different currencies.

700
00:49:42,093 --> 00:49:42,696
Rym: you can try to.

701
00:49:42,776 --> 00:49:43,579
Scott: I think you could have.

702
00:49:44,182 --> 00:49:50,360
Scott: Think you could have things where like if you're playing the game with this strategy the woods Strategy that like six workers is perfect.

703
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:59,832
Scott: But if you're going down the the gold strategy then maybe you need seven workers because you need seven dwarves Gold right and it the way those actions are constructed.

704
00:50:00,274 --> 00:50:08,060
Scott: and then but that still would just be Figure out the optimal number of workers for each strategy, and I guess the point is everything we discussed.

705
00:50:09,061 --> 00:50:19,160
Rym: but if you can get more workers, or you can use more workers than someone else then Figuring that out becomes the most important skill in the game.

706
00:50:19,754 --> 00:50:24,113
Scott: Yes What the one way you can balance it is the way you can balance anything.

707
00:50:24,213 --> 00:50:26,200
Scott: which is that if there are going to be?

708
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:31,680
Scott: Additional actions you know hand it out above the other and it's not symmetrical between all players.

709
00:50:32,381 --> 00:50:34,970
Scott: Then you have to use an auction of some.

710
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:38,040
Rym: auction is the escape edge for almost any balance problems.

711
00:50:38,281 --> 00:50:41,140
Scott: You need some auction or something right and it's like okay?

712
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:46,705
Scott: If you let someone buy the extra worker for a dollar and you lose because of that well It's that was your own fault right.

713
00:50:46,745 --> 00:50:53,647
Scott: but people if you had to bid in Agricola for with food to buy the baby Right at the baby market.

714
00:50:54,149 --> 00:50:55,333
Scott: It's like the game would be.

715
00:50:55,514 --> 00:50:55,855
Scott: that's it.

716
00:50:55,895 --> 00:50:57,100
Scott: the game is not balanced right?

717
00:50:57,260 --> 00:51:03,109
Scott: No one's gonna run away with the extra baby and win the game because the food they had to pay to get it Would even out.

718
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:08,840
Rym: now a third way to go And I'm thinking some spitball in this partly because I can't think of a worker placement game.

719
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,592
Rym: That's done this but Hansa toy tonica does this.

720
00:51:11,973 --> 00:51:13,600
Rym: it's a run actions not workers.

721
00:51:14,122 --> 00:51:18,839
Rym: You can spend resources to upgrade your actions and have more actions.

722
00:51:19,602 --> 00:51:33,340
Rym: But you can also spend resources to do other things in the game that are equally powerful to having more actions And thus it actually does create contention like if multiple people are trying to get more actions.

723
00:51:33,861 --> 00:51:39,960
Rym: You can almost do better by doing other less contentious things and level up other similarly powerful actions.

724
00:51:40,381 --> 00:51:46,080
Rym: But I struggle to apply that to worker placement in this context, but I feel like there's something there.

725
00:51:47,482 --> 00:51:50,518
Rym: But humps is a weird and other things that other games haven't done across the board.

726
00:51:52,061 --> 00:51:58,447
Scott: Another thing that's really simple to do is just have a way for people to lose workers One time use or dead work.

727
00:51:58,487 --> 00:51:58,909
Rym: Oh great.

728
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,133
Rym: I forget the victory points.

729
00:52:00,153 --> 00:52:00,856
Rym: What if a curricula was?

730
00:52:00,936 --> 00:52:01,960
Rym: Oh, yeah, you couldn't feed that kid.

731
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:02,546
Rym: They're gone.

732
00:52:02,566 --> 00:52:03,717
Scott: That sucks.

733
00:52:03,757 --> 00:52:05,626
Scott: Yeah Yeah shit like that.

734
00:52:05,646 --> 00:52:10,691
Scott: Yeah, it's just like, you know, okay, so You know you can still.

735
00:52:10,792 --> 00:52:12,160
Scott: people can get more workers.

736
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,610
Scott: They put resources into that.

737
00:52:14,093 --> 00:52:25,155
Scott: but you know It might not be a huge impact if that worker like isn't just some permanent upgrade that makes them 20 25% stronger than the everyone else for the whole rest of the game.

738
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:27,890
Scott: if it's just okay You're 25% stronger for a turn or two.

739
00:52:30,061 --> 00:52:35,940
Scott: It's like then it's not as big a deal and now it's not obviously so strong because that you would just have to go.

740
00:52:36,101 --> 00:52:40,540
Rym: I've seen games where you can't get an extra permanent worker, but you can like get a temporary worker.

741
00:52:40,581 --> 00:52:41,918
Rym: That's good for some number of uses.

742
00:52:42,903 --> 00:52:51,540
Rym: Yeah seen games like that So, huh now I'm thinking about because one thing that I think is really important is worker placement Even if the game does it some other way.

743
00:52:51,601 --> 00:52:57,797
Rym: I Like the physicality of having some sort of token that I put in a public place like place it out there.

744
00:52:58,078 --> 00:52:59,424
Rym: It's visible It's physical.

745
00:52:59,966 --> 00:53:01,052
Rym: I think that's important.

746
00:53:01,373 --> 00:53:02,760
Rym: But I also think it's underused.

747
00:53:03,081 --> 00:53:10,305
Rym: There are so few worker placement games where our worker is so many way to know where a worker Might have to.

748
00:53:10,746 --> 00:53:17,850
Rym: what if the worker placement the worker has to move around the map to get to the place Like in a grid?

749
00:53:18,434 --> 00:53:23,040
Rym: what if Whoever has the most workers in a place is the only one that gets to do the thing?

750
00:53:23,261 --> 00:53:25,271
Rym: It's a colonel blotto mixed with worker placement.

751
00:53:26,236 --> 00:53:30,391
Scott: I mean you have like Genoa Genoa moving around a little.

752
00:53:30,411 --> 00:53:35,440
Scott: you're moving around the town Yeah, or it's like you could even consider clue sort of like that, right?

753
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:40,440
Scott: It's like yeah, you know You can only inquire about the study if you're standing in the study the action.

754
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41,104
Scott: It's like you might.

755
00:53:41,648 --> 00:53:48,180
Scott: you might know it was the conservatory But you can't guess the conservatory unless you roll and walk your ass over to the conservatory.

756
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:50,370
Rym: Yeah, I just think that it's important.

757
00:53:50,651 --> 00:53:59,100
Rym: if someone's thinking about worker placement It is useful and worthwhile to think about it in the context of placing physical markers in a shared space.

758
00:53:59,221 --> 00:54:17,099
Rym: I think that physicality matters Even though like you can argue a lot of things that don't have any of that Could mathematically be worker placement, but even if you have a game like that, that's why I get back to that first point I feel like it's worthwhile to think of it in those physical terms Or at least describe it in those physical terms.

759
00:54:18,541 --> 00:54:27,169
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know a lot of things, you know, you could somewhat argue right our sort of worker placement Right, like, you know or at least part like.

760
00:54:27,189 --> 00:54:29,820
Scott: think about I don't know magic the gathering the everything game, right?

761
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:30,162
Scott: It's like.

762
00:54:30,302 --> 00:54:30,765
Scott: is there any?

763
00:54:31,006 --> 00:54:31,147
Scott: there's?

764
00:54:31,187 --> 00:54:33,360
Scott: no there's no worker place in a magic the gathering, right?

765
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:34,564
Scott: But it's like.

766
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:51,060
Scott: well if you can think about your mana as like those are Every mana is a worker and you when you play it, you know, you could either have workers build new cards Which are then themselves actions, right at least if the cards have mana activation costs, right?

767
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:55,720
Scott: Not creatures wouldn't count right but because creatures could act on their own without workers.

768
00:54:55,741 --> 00:55:02,180
Scott: Yeah But you know you spend two mana and the bill do you send those two workers to the builder area?

769
00:55:02,623 --> 00:55:03,811
Scott: Right the two red mana.

770
00:55:04,072 --> 00:55:12,400
Scott: and you summon this You know artifact that has a two mana activation cost and then you move two more of your mana workers onto the artifact.

771
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:14,587
Scott: Yeah, take that action, right?

772
00:55:14,667 --> 00:55:15,590
Scott: It's like you're.

773
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:28,720
Scott: you know, it's not really a worker placement because You're not playing like on the same actions as the opponent and blocking them Right, and like I said, you can summon creatures that just act on their own, right?

774
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:31,989
Scott: Not everything has as this worker cost to do things.

775
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:35,940
Scott: but you can see how like it looks nothing like a worker placement game.

776
00:55:36,786 --> 00:55:42,301
Scott: but that aspect of You have a limited resource to take actions with you You're.

777
00:55:42,562 --> 00:55:46,860
Scott: what actions you can take are determined by the state of the board, right?

778
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:53,500
Scott: And you allocate your resources of playing to which of the what the actions you will activate in which ones you own.

779
00:55:54,502 --> 00:56:05,391
Rym: So I think if we did like say we did a panel or we went deeper on this topic overall I feel like there's a place for taking a few specific worker placement games and we'd have to play a lot of newer ones.

780
00:56:05,491 --> 00:56:16,768
Scott: if anyone people noticing people who know have been listening to this 15 years almost every game we mentioned was designed at least seven years ago Because we basically didn't play.

781
00:56:16,809 --> 00:56:23,574
Scott: we stopped playing a lot of worker placement games, you know We sort of played so many of them that we haven't played too many since then.

782
00:56:23,614 --> 00:56:28,133
Scott: like crown of Amara is like the lady So good there I think they'll.

783
00:56:28,234 --> 00:56:33,176
Scott: actually there was the the Well, we did an episode of those dude imperium and the other one.

784
00:56:33,196 --> 00:56:40,579
Rym: Yeah Dude, imperium is listed on this list of worker placement games I pulled up and there's the archaeology one where we're with our next.

785
00:56:40,599 --> 00:56:46,779
Scott: they were Yes, they're combining the worker placement with the deck building into sort of a combo deal, right?

786
00:56:48,401 --> 00:56:53,420
Scott: And it's like those like the newest ones we played but we've only played those like once or twice each like not enough.

787
00:56:53,884 --> 00:57:03,920
Scott: So if we're gonna do it We had to play a bunch of newer ones to see what more recent Developments are and then part of the panel is just gonna be going over a few not too many.

788
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:07,260
Scott: Yeah, right, but just highlighting, you know different aspects.

789
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:14,223
Scott: I feel like you go over a few and then also highlighting the specific strategies for games and then maybe Contrasting.

790
00:57:14,243 --> 00:57:18,500
Scott: but like look in this game the strategy to win is this and this they changes one thing.

791
00:57:18,942 --> 00:57:21,130
Scott: And now that the way to win this game is completely different

792
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:21,412
Rym: I think

793
00:57:21,472 --> 00:57:22,215
Scott: as they change the one

794
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:37,614
Rym: along the way me hopefully we can build the beginning of a lexicon similar to how trick-taking games have a very good lexicon of the characteristics of trick-taking games so that once you learn one like Everybody kind of speaks the same language of explaining.

795
00:57:37,674 --> 00:57:38,760
Rym: Oh and this one, you know follow suit.

796
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:44,899
Rym: There's two Trump's and there's a coalition and like they have this language Trick-taking games don't quite have that language yet.

797
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:53,420
Rym: But most gamers who play board games if you think about it You can start bucketing worker placement games pretty easily based on the kinds of things they include.

798
00:57:53,863 --> 00:57:56,419
Rym: But we don't have a shared language to describe all those things.

799
00:57:57,642 --> 00:57:59,919
Rym: We tend to describe them and not have a word for them.

800
00:58:00,323 --> 00:58:07,200
Rym: I don't know if we're gonna be good at making up words for them But I think we can at least start to describe What are the primary types of characteristics of worker placement games?

801
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:13,968
Rym: If nothing else that'll we'll have to do that ourselves just while trying to write this panel Even if that's not in the panel.

802
00:58:13,988 --> 00:58:19,919
Rym: if that's just what we did to figure out the panel Maybe yeah thinking a lot about worker placement.

803
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:21,667
Rym: I'm also desperately hungry and I gotta go vote.

804
00:58:21,888 --> 00:58:24,701
Scott: So I already voted early.

805
00:58:24,721 --> 00:58:34,123
Rym: and often like This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

806
00:58:34,163 --> 00:58:39,314
Rym: special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brand ok for the logos.

807
00:58:39,515 --> 00:58:41,501
Scott: be sure to visit our website at front row.

808
00:58:41,541 --> 00:58:44,550
Scott: crew calm for show notes discussion news and more.

809
00:58:44,810 --> 00:58:52,210
Rym: Remember GeekNights is not one but four different shows sci-tech Mondays gaming Tuesdays anime comic Wednesdays and indiscriminate Thursdays.

810

Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons attribution 3.0 license.

811
00:58:57,012 --> 00:59:03,198
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience But unlike those other late shows it's actually recorded at night

812
00:59:03,459 --> 00:59:21,869
Rym: and the patreon patrons for this episode of geek guides are Alan Joyce Linky G dread lily teddy break case care makes music Chris a dog Clinton Walton Dex Finn Joel Hayes penny rhymer Rebecca Dunn Sam Erickson shirvin Von Harl and a ton of people who give like a dollar or a euro per month.

813
00:59:22,431 --> 00:59:25,098
Rym: So yeah, uh GeekNights is back at conventions.

814
00:59:25,138 --> 00:59:27,544
Rym: Look forward to our panel games.

815
00:59:27,584 --> 00:59:28,466
Rym: You can't play.

816
00:59:28,487 --> 00:59:33,404
Rym: I just have to Because Scott is extra pedantic and weird about panel names.

817
00:59:33,444 --> 00:59:35,050
Rym: Sometimes I know he never listens to this.

818
00:59:35,471 --> 00:59:43,585
Rym: He does not want to talk about games that could possibly under extreme circumstances Maybe be played without changing the title.

819
00:59:43,645 --> 00:59:44,730
Rym: and I'm not gonna change the title.

820
00:59:44,850 --> 00:59:47,735
Rym: I'm gonna lie to him about the title and he won't notice and it'll be fine.

821
00:59:48,216 --> 00:59:53,572
Rym: But anyway tonight I leave you with Megan Megan.

822
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:57,309
Rym: we need your help, Megan Megan what?

823
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:00,617
Rym: We need your help Megan.

824
01:00:00,898 --> 01:00:01,260
Rym: again.

825
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:04,892
Rym: all the flutter ponies have been captured Again.

826
01:00:04,912 --> 01:00:08,064
Rym: will you come back and help us defeat the people and free our friends?

827
01:00:08,185 --> 01:00:09,530
Scott: can't the other ponies help?

828
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:11,610
Scott: They have also all been captured.

829
01:00:12,691 --> 01:00:14,176
Scott: You're the only one who can help Megan.

830
01:00:14,417 --> 01:00:17,969
Rym: We need your human mungus brain and dextrous fingers to rescue them.

831
01:00:21,788 --> 01:00:26,490
Scott: Okay Hey, nah crap, let the ponies go fuck.

832
01:00:26,510 --> 01:00:27,353
Scott: Are you supposed to be?

833
01:00:27,453 --> 01:00:29,019
Scott: No, I said let the ponies go now.
