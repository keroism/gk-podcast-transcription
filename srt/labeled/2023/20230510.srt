1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,992
Rym: It's Wednesday, May 10th, 2023.

2
00:00:11,992 --> 00:00:12,453
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,075 --> 00:00:14,659
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:18,559
Rym: tonight We are talking about Makoto Shinkai's latest Suzume.

5
00:00:19,481 --> 00:00:20,497
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:27,440
Rym: So, uh in New York City, we got the city bike, which is our like docked bike share program.

7
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:28,285
Rym: Like it's pretty good.

8
00:00:28,325 --> 00:00:30,900
Rym: Like I use these bikes a lot in my day to day life.

9
00:00:31,161 --> 00:00:35,700
Scott: It's like the biggest bike share thing ever and those and New York.

10
00:00:36,182 --> 00:00:37,126
Scott: It's the biggest in the world.

11
00:00:37,187 --> 00:00:38,332
Scott: it's the biggest in the u.s.

12
00:00:38,412 --> 00:00:38,533
Scott: It's.

13
00:00:38,935 --> 00:00:39,980
Scott: it's the same system.

14
00:00:40,201 --> 00:00:40,685
Rym: Basically.

15
00:00:40,746 --> 00:00:42,400
Rym: that's in like Paris and all these other cities.

16
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:55,470
Rym: But in New York like I use this most of the time like I use my real bike to go on like a bike trip the weather is decent and I'm going pretty much anywhere that there are city bike docks and City bike will get me there fast enough.

17
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:57,440
Scott: It is the best choice.

18
00:00:57,976 --> 00:01:10,760
Rym: Yeah In fact when I had to get my remember when my camcorder like the lens scratched itself internally at yeah So to do the RMA to get the replacement I box that giant thing up in this giant box.

19
00:01:11,082 --> 00:01:13,620
Rym: I strapped it to a city bike and I biked to the FedEx store.

20
00:01:14,467 --> 00:01:25,903
Rym: Yeah So, uh and we have regular bikes and about 20% of the system is e-bikes and you have to pay a little bit if you Use the e-bike compared to the even if you guys you can get an annual membership Which is like you can.

21
00:01:26,124 --> 00:01:33,533
Scott: if you have an annual membership, you can ride non e-bikes normal bikes all you want Just for basically you.

22
00:01:33,553 --> 00:01:40,280
Scott: just the thing is any Individual ride has to be under 45 minutes and then you dock it and you take it right back out and you can keep riding.

23
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:44,484
Scott: Yep, if you hold one over 45 minutes, then you get charged But an e-bike?

24
00:01:44,806 --> 00:01:47,060
Scott: as soon as you take an e-bike out you start getting charged money.

25
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,579
Rym: And if you don't have an annual plan, they cost a lot.

26
00:01:49,946 --> 00:01:53,250
Scott: But yeah but if you have an annual plan you get charged a little bit

27
00:01:53,631 --> 00:02:12,880
Rym: if and basically if you're cuz I use them kind of often now partly because They are if you're biking from our apartment in Queens to pretty much anywhere Midtown between Midtown and like Astor place it is as fast as the subway or faster and it is cheaper than one swipe of the subway.

28
00:02:13,462 --> 00:02:16,760
Scott: But it's not cheaper than a non e-bike, which is free.

29
00:02:17,062 --> 00:02:22,200
Rym: But if you need to get there with the speed of the subway It is faster than the subway and cheaper than the subway.

30
00:02:22,602 --> 00:02:24,451
Scott: I mean I bike on a city bike.

31
00:02:24,612 --> 00:02:26,200
Scott: unless it's a really far ride.

32
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,784
Scott: It's you know Like any ride to Manhattan.

33
00:02:29,326 --> 00:02:35,528
Scott: if I leave the house and get on the city bike right outside and someone else has to take a bus Or walk to the subway.

34
00:02:36,251 --> 00:02:38,040
Scott: I'll get there basically at the same time they get.

35
00:02:38,164 --> 00:02:42,117
Scott: Oh, yeah I can see that the non e-bike is gonna get you there faster than this.

36
00:02:42,137 --> 00:02:54,920
Rym: my difference The e-bike is way faster than the city bike only because we live next to the subway station And I'm always going to places like my office next to the subway station and it is still faster.

37
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:03,660
Rym: but anyway We have regular e-bikes like the first ones they rolled out which are Little bit janky looking like they're they're a bit hinky and how they made them, but they work.

38
00:03:03,763 --> 00:03:04,059
Rym: Okay.

39
00:03:04,502 --> 00:03:08,980
Rym: But they made some new fancy ones that are big and white and they're more like an e-motorbike like they're legit.

40
00:03:09,483 --> 00:03:10,329
Rym: They're way fast.

41
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:10,833
Rym: They're like.

42
00:03:10,893 --> 00:03:11,759
Rym: I actually really like them.

43
00:03:13,382 --> 00:03:25,660
Rym: But there was a phenomenon in New York City that had and still happening but less so than it used to Where you'll every now and then just see one of those things just like Laying on the ground somewhere random in the city like halfway across.

44
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:30,496
Scott: I've seen them way upstate and way far away from any city bike.

45
00:03:30,537 --> 00:03:37,320
Rym: We saw one Right next to the bike path that goes off from the main bike path to Tarrytown.

46
00:03:38,964 --> 00:03:40,136
Scott: Everyone saw that same one.

47
00:03:40,176 --> 00:03:40,560
Scott: it was sitting.

48
00:03:41,762 --> 00:03:48,382
Rym: I was gonna like post it on reddit and I saw someone had already posted it and a bunch of people were posting like their Photos of it.

49
00:03:48,482 --> 00:03:52,053
Rym: It might still be there and it's there to this day.

50
00:03:52,073 --> 00:03:59,275
Rym: It could be so, uh There were two there and I learned today of a second way that that can happen.

51
00:03:59,315 --> 00:04:06,957
Rym: because the first way that it was happening people was people would get one of those bikes out and then they would like stop riding and park it somewhere.

52
00:04:07,178 --> 00:04:12,754
Rym: and because those bikes Are extremely expensive if you leave them somewhere like not moving for long enough.

53
00:04:13,115 --> 00:04:23,169
Rym: They assume that you abandon them They lock themselves so you can't even roll them and any time you start rolling them that a little siren goes like we we we We we we we you and they call for help.

54
00:04:23,692 --> 00:04:26,361
Rym: So the city bike people can go get them Like.

55
00:04:26,863 --> 00:04:31,058
Rym: I don't know why people were like taking these things out and just like parking them somewhere cuz they will don't?

56
00:04:31,218 --> 00:04:32,383
Scott: I mean people Don't you know?

57
00:04:32,423 --> 00:04:33,106
Scott: read the thing?

58
00:04:33,146 --> 00:04:37,680
Scott: It's just they do what they you know, as soon as you get the bike out of the dock It's like you can ride it freely.

59
00:04:37,941 --> 00:04:44,320
Rym: It's like there's nothing to stop you right from like all the people we see getting on like the Staten Island ferry with them.

60
00:04:44,762 --> 00:04:51,080
Scott: It's not like the bike yells at you and says hey, if you don't bring me back to a dock in one minute Yeah, I'm gonna get charged this much money.

61
00:04:51,281 --> 00:04:56,440
Scott: It's like people, you know, and especially if it's not on your card or anything, you know, or you got the bike somehow else.

62
00:04:56,881 --> 00:04:59,932
Scott: It's like, you know, just go people just go wild.

63
00:04:59,992 --> 00:05:02,503
Scott: and if the bike, you know ends up somewhere else Yeah.

64
00:05:03,907 --> 00:05:10,842
Rym: So yesterday at my way home from work I come out of work and I look and there's one e-bike available like right next to my office and it's one of the white ones.

65
00:05:11,124 --> 00:05:11,668
Rym: so I go over.

66
00:05:11,688 --> 00:05:23,838
Rym: they put my little key in and Instead of just unlocking immediately, which is how this system works It sits there blinking the yellow light for like 90 seconds And I don't walk away because what I know you can't do.

67
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:27,999
Scott: that That's the way that'd be the worst possible thing because you gotta wait for the red light and then take a different one.

68
00:05:28,581 --> 00:05:33,697
Rym: So then the red light comes on and the bike pops out of the dock.

69
00:05:33,717 --> 00:05:35,845
Scott: Oh That's a that's it.

70
00:05:35,905 --> 00:05:36,829
Scott: I've never seen that happen.

71
00:05:36,849 --> 00:05:38,656
Scott: That's the craziest bug I've ever seen right?

72
00:05:39,098 --> 00:05:42,349
Rym: So, uh I take the bike and it works.

73
00:05:42,871 --> 00:05:43,112
Rym: It's just.

74
00:05:43,172 --> 00:05:44,296
Rym: it's e-biking like.

75
00:05:44,336 --> 00:05:44,677
Rym: it's totally.

76
00:05:44,697 --> 00:05:46,865
Rym: it's working fine And I should.

77
00:05:46,905 --> 00:05:51,745
Rym: I would have slammed it back in and I look at my app and the app says I did not check it out.

78
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:57,420
Scott: So yeah, that's why I would slam it back in because I have stolen this e-bike if I wanted to correct.

79
00:05:57,962 --> 00:05:59,327
Rym: So I decide to see.

80
00:05:59,347 --> 00:06:02,700
Rym: I bet it's gonna lock up on me and I just start biking home with it.

81
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:04,649
Rym: And it totally works.

82
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:05,759
Scott: lock up while you're riding.

83
00:06:06,561 --> 00:06:08,572
Scott: So I don't think it would because of safety did.

84
00:06:08,692 --> 00:06:10,200
Rym: it did lock up while I was riding.

85
00:06:10,762 --> 00:06:13,292
Rym: Wow, interesting if they're stolen they lock up.

86
00:06:13,312 --> 00:06:14,075
Rym: but the way it worked.

87
00:06:14,095 --> 00:06:14,697
Rym: so I'm biking.

88
00:06:14,717 --> 00:06:15,360
Rym: I didn't make it far.

89
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:22,873
Rym: I made it like a couple blocks and I was biking along a path where I knew there were a lot of docks Because I was confident this would happen.

90
00:06:22,913 --> 00:06:24,039
Rym: I was just curious about it.

91
00:06:24,481 --> 00:06:35,780
Rym: so I bike a little bit and then the city bike just starts making the siren sound while I'm biking and then It feels like the brakes were just very slowly engaged until it comes to a halt and then it's just stuck.

92
00:06:36,741 --> 00:06:40,292
Rym: And I was about I don't know 50 yards away from a dock.

93
00:06:40,332 --> 00:06:44,162
Rym: like I could see the dock, but then I realized I Can't drag it.

94
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:46,312
Rym: I can't push it to the dock because the wheels are locked up.

95
00:06:46,935 --> 00:06:48,843
Scott: So pick it up So heavy.

96
00:06:49,105 --> 00:06:52,880
Rym: I messaged city bike and I was like, hey, I got this bike out and it locked up on me.

97
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,663
Rym: I just played dumb.

98
00:06:54,144 --> 00:06:56,873
Rym: and they respond immediately like oh, yeah, don't worry about it.

99
00:06:56,914 --> 00:06:57,435
Rym: That happens.

100
00:06:57,616 --> 00:06:58,238
Rym: Just leave it there.

101
00:06:58,278 --> 00:06:58,760
Rym: We'll find it.

102
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,738
Rym: Okay, and I was like you're sure just leave it here like on the side of Lexington Avenue.

103
00:07:03,758 --> 00:07:05,325
Rym: and they're like, yeah Don't worry about it.

104
00:07:05,887 --> 00:07:07,875
Rym: And I was like, this is official I can just leave it here.

105
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:09,220
Rym: I will not be charged.

106
00:07:09,361 --> 00:07:11,878
Scott: I didn't have a recording of this conversation or you're all good.

107
00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:16,406
Rym: Yep I took like four screenshots of this conversation I had with that and then I left.

108
00:07:16,867 --> 00:07:24,667
Scott: and that's my story because I mean if you lose the normal bike that does no Thousand bucks or something twelve hundred bucks.

109
00:07:24,828 --> 00:07:33,540
Scott: if you write it's on your account and I can't imagine if you lose the white ebike Like and you don't get it back into a dock and it's missing on your account.

110
00:07:33,982 --> 00:07:35,629
Scott: Imagine what they charge you five thousand.

111
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:36,231
Scott: I don't know right?

112
00:07:36,793 --> 00:07:38,059
Rym: I don't ever want to find out.

113
00:07:38,179 --> 00:07:42,435
Rym: but So yeah, I stole any bike and that's what I'm spending.

114
00:07:42,475 --> 00:07:43,380
Scott: five thousand on a bike.

115
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,646
Scott: At least I want to have the bike.

116
00:07:44,827 --> 00:07:47,619
Rym: a five thousand dollars won't even buy you a good mountain bike.

117
00:07:47,619 --> 00:07:50,940
Scott: $5,000 will buy you an excellent bike of any kind.

118
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:55,577
Rym: It'll buy you know, it'll buy you an okay mountain bike or an excellent literally any other bike.

119
00:07:55,618 --> 00:07:56,240
Scott: That's nonsense.

120
00:07:56,361 --> 00:07:58,640
Scott: You can buy an excellent bike for five thousand dollars.

121
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:07,880
Rym: I've wrote I've ridden four and five thousand dollar mountain bikes, but I did ride an $11,000 mountain bike once and holy fuck was that fun?

122
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,625
Scott: Imagine there'd be that much difference.

123
00:08:11,706 --> 00:08:12,731
Rym: Well, you know what the difference was.

124
00:08:13,133 --> 00:08:14,360
Rym: the entire thing was carbon.

125
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:18,393
Rym: So despite being a mountain bike with a full suspension, it didn't weigh anything.

126
00:08:18,815 --> 00:08:26,360
Rym: It had electronic shifters And the suspension was like drop 20 feet and you don't even feel it.

127
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,860
Rym: Anyway in some anime news, I got a geek bite animation news.

128
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:40,020
Rym: I got a geek bite because the Owl House the Disney show the fantasy horror comedy Fantastic show and I've talked about a few times in GeekNights.

129
00:08:40,381 --> 00:08:44,780
Rym: We all know it got cancelled because Disney didn't really feel like it was part of their brand.

130
00:08:45,121 --> 00:08:55,078
Rym: They had an executive shakeup and there was some drama about the fact that it was hard to push this show in Certain markets like China because of the heavy LGBT content in it.

131
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:57,447
Scott: So it's something only you know.

132
00:08:57,607 --> 00:09:01,420
Scott: nerds cared about a lot of nerds, but it wasn't a mass popular thing.

133
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,405
Scott: Yeah, it's not in the public consciousness.

134
00:09:03,586 --> 00:09:06,153
Rym: So I got cancelled but they did let them.

135
00:09:06,674 --> 00:09:08,860
Rym: they couldn't make their third and final big season.

136
00:09:09,302 --> 00:09:17,580
Rym: So instead they actually got the budget to make three Basically made for TV movies with pretty high budgets surprisingly.

137
00:09:17,622 --> 00:09:27,994
Rym: Yeah We discussed how this has become a trend of some sort and they actually did the thing that very few people do correctly in that situation the in those three movies.

138
00:09:28,538 --> 00:09:57,780
Rym: they Successfully in my opinion and now that I've seen all of the Owl House Holy and completely wrapped up the entire show every open question every loose thread in a surprisingly satisfying and meaningful way like I Can't imagine they could have wrapped it up better And in fact, it might have ended up been being better than what it would have been if it hadn't been cancelled because what happened Was I'm gonna go all the way back to an anime that I hope GeekNights listeners have watched.

139
00:09:58,102 --> 00:10:07,299
Rym: I don't think we've talked about this in over a decade on the show But eska flown a a B plus or a minus tier anime of all time.

140
00:10:08,003 --> 00:10:09,170
Rym: I'm not gonna say S tier is.

141
00:10:09,673 --> 00:10:14,478
Rym: it's S tier in my heart But I'm not gonna say it's S tier on any other scale, but it's a good show.

142
00:10:15,962 --> 00:10:24,756
Rym: one thing that made eska flown a notable was that it was supposed to be 52 episodes and For a bunch of reasons mostly around budgets it got cut to 26 episodes.

143
00:10:25,077 --> 00:10:25,819
Rym: So what did they do?

144
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:34,980
Rym: after 13 episodes the next 13 episodes they just cut Everything all the filler but told the same story.

145
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:40,497
Rym: so this show accelerates all thriller no filler like to a degree that is shocking.

146
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:44,909
Rym: you go from Typical fantasy story with robots to what the fuck?

147
00:10:45,189 --> 00:10:46,533
Rym: Why is Isaac Newton here?

148
00:10:46,794 --> 00:10:47,335
Rym: Wait a minute.

149
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,077
Rym: They have nukes.

150
00:10:48,418 --> 00:10:49,180
Scott: what's going on?

151
00:10:50,931 --> 00:11:00,393
Rym: Yeah Spoilers on eska flown a and if I don't think that's really a spoiler cuz you're gonna watch You could watch 13 episodes of this show and think back to everything.

152
00:11:00,433 --> 00:11:06,540
Rym: I just said and have no Possible conception of how I say Newton and nuclear weapons are ready.

153
00:11:07,322 --> 00:11:13,320
Scott: It's a spoiler because in the show right spoilers, I guess also additional spoilers, right?

154
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,486
Scott: They from early on in the show.

155
00:11:15,546 --> 00:11:17,894
Scott: They're referring to this mysterious enemy.

156
00:11:18,155 --> 00:11:19,720
Scott: Who's like the big boss, right?

157
00:11:19,901 --> 00:11:22,335
Rym: Assuming it's like a wizard like the wizard, right?

158
00:11:22,435 --> 00:11:28,989
Scott: They're like, right It's sort of like, you know, there's a big bad guy named Isaac sort of like in Star Wars You know, there's a big bad guy who's just the Emperor.

159
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:31,620
Scott: and then eventually finally you see the Emperor, right?

160
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:35,710
Scott: It's like, you know, it's like ah There's a bad guy named Isaac and you don't think for a second.

161
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,673
Scott: that is Isaac Newton.

162
00:11:36,934 --> 00:11:41,070
Scott: and then towards the end of the show They reveal the Isaac that's been the bad guy.

163
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:45,269
Rym: the whole time is Isaac and the reveal is so great because they're like It's Isaac Newton and you're like.

164
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:45,610
Rym: what?

165
00:11:45,651 --> 00:11:47,038
Rym: like the guy?

166
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,697
Rym: Gravity calculus Apple guy that one and the show is like.

167
00:11:51,918 --> 00:11:54,469
Rym: yes Exactly the show like it's like.

168
00:11:54,489 --> 00:11:57,020
Rym: they just put it in impact font to just put it on the front of the screen.

169
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:01,114
Rym: Yes, it's Isaac Newton and then everything goes off the fucking rails from there.

170
00:12:01,214 --> 00:12:05,080
Rym: the gravity guy that one anyway So the olives kind of does the same thing.

171
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:10,639
Rym: it's there is zero filler at all and they just follow the plot to the ultimate end.

172
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:24,359
Rym: and surprisingly the actual meta plot like what was going on is a Surprisingly complex like high fantasy story that was way bigger than I expected and pretty good.

173
00:12:25,721 --> 00:12:26,805
Rym: So the show was fantastic.

174
00:12:26,845 --> 00:12:30,979
Rym: the way it ended and I guess the things I would say about it without spoiling much is that one.

175
00:12:32,144 --> 00:12:33,840
Rym: It does not do it Like.

176
00:12:34,342 --> 00:12:48,033
Rym: it doesn't do the thing that a lot of shows like this have done throughout all of history Where they don't let main characters fully power up and they don't let main characters say fuck it I live in the fantasy world or why do I go back home?

177
00:12:48,073 --> 00:12:49,820
Rym: Like isn't this place way better?

178
00:12:50,320 --> 00:13:06,289
Rym: it avoids all those old boring tropes and just goes full-on in the right direction - they put in as much gay content as possible and they clearly made it so that it would be Almost impossible to edit out of the show.

179
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:13,625
Rym: and I think they did that on purpose to make it hard For Disney to put this show in certain markets Like they even had.

180
00:13:13,665 --> 00:13:19,789
Scott: Disney could have always, you know, not let them continue or you know put in so yep They already had the budget.

181
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:24,323
Rym: So they just made the show and three it has.

182
00:13:24,343 --> 00:13:28,935
Rym: you know, it's a kids show and it has the the meta plot of or the meta story.

183
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:34,332
Rym: if you should forgive people like Someone who's a bad person obviously circumstance led them to this.

184
00:13:34,693 --> 00:13:39,019
Rym: you can't like you've got to stop their actions But you also have to understand why they're this way.

185
00:13:39,601 --> 00:13:50,280
Rym: But it also goes a step further to point out that you only give someone so many chances and then You just don't give them any more chances and maybe you got to kill him.

186
00:13:50,661 --> 00:13:53,934
Rym: Like maybe they just can't be allowed to continue to do their thing.

187
00:13:53,994 --> 00:13:55,379
Scott: Yeah, it seems they still work.

188
00:13:55,661 --> 00:13:58,980
Scott: Yeah, the out allows kind of ends with long as people have necks.

189
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:01,005
Rym: Yeah, the out allows kind of ends.

190
00:14:01,086 --> 00:14:14,625
Rym: on a note of there is a line beyond which yeah guillotine time like Nuremberg trials And I was surprised that the show went that far and it does it in a really really good way in my opinion All right.

191
00:14:15,048 --> 00:14:24,920
Scott: I mean I can appreciate that to some extent right, you know I've been realizing more recently like the past few years like all the arts that I enjoy at least fictional stories are the ones that Are.

192
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:34,719
Scott: you know abstract, you know challenging not having answers right being ambiguous, you know, whatever You know only asking questions not giving answers, right?

193
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:48,815
Scott: But if you're gonna be the kind of story that you know is giving answers Then you should be exactly what you just said giving all the answers not Lazily forgetting plot threads so that the people are like what about X character?

194
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:50,400
Scott: They just we just never saw them again.

195
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:51,540
Scott: Oh, yeah, what happened?

196
00:14:52,861 --> 00:14:57,282
Rym: zero open questions of any Importance.

197
00:14:57,302 --> 00:15:01,720
Scott: that's that's tight writing to remember everything to keep it all together, right?

198
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:07,415
Rym: But also the fact that the answers were all Satisfying and didn't feel like heck down at the end.

199
00:15:07,436 --> 00:15:11,140
Rym: That's Yeah, it didn't even feel like fanservice.

200
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:12,424
Scott: It's tough to be.

201
00:15:12,504 --> 00:15:17,980
Scott: if that's really a skilled writing technique is how do you be satisfying without being fanservice?

202
00:15:18,401 --> 00:15:24,280
Rym: Yep, Picard season 3 was moderately satisfying but it was too much fanservice.

203
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:31,400
Rym: This somehow got that line, right and I struggle to think of many more examples of something that I would say struck that balance.

204
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:43,698
Scott: Yeah, the key to being satisfying without being fanservice right is fan service is giving people what they want and what they And what they want is also what they think they want, right?

205
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:54,007
Scott: Whereas not fanservice is giving something someone they wanted but they didn't know they wanted it and they didn't even conceive that it existed Right, but they're there.

206
00:15:54,167 --> 00:15:56,032
Scott: it pleases them once you deliver it.

207
00:15:56,093 --> 00:15:57,196
Scott: Yeah, that's the correct way.

208
00:15:57,236 --> 00:16:02,252
Rym: like like What's not like evangelical parts of evangelical like.

209
00:16:02,372 --> 00:16:04,220
Rym: oh, this is what you want here.

210
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,688
Rym: I'm gonna give you exactly what you want.

211
00:16:05,989 --> 00:16:06,532
Rym: That sucks.

212
00:16:06,553 --> 00:16:06,955
Rym: Doesn't it?

213
00:16:07,236 --> 00:16:07,739
Rym: Guess what?

214
00:16:10,523 --> 00:16:11,637
Rym: All right, so you got some news.

215
00:16:13,323 --> 00:16:14,534
Scott: Just a tiny news, right?

216
00:16:14,595 --> 00:16:22,825
Scott: We had Shin Godzilla came to to the US a long time ago, right and then there was the shin Ultraman Which I did manage to see.

217
00:16:22,886 --> 00:16:24,291
Scott: did I actually talk about that on this show?

218
00:16:24,332 --> 00:16:25,195
Scott: and I didn't see it.

219
00:16:25,356 --> 00:16:28,560
Rym: really sure you did But I'd have to go look through the archive to be a hundred percent.

220
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,040
Scott: I mean, it's not as good as Shin Godzilla and it's better.

221
00:16:31,181 --> 00:16:35,700
Scott: It's really, you know more geared towards people actually know things about Ultraman and care about Ultraman.

222
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,089
Rym: I think it did a full bite of it.

223
00:16:37,774 --> 00:16:38,458
Scott: It's still okay.

224
00:16:39,181 --> 00:16:45,760
Scott: But yeah, Shin Kamen Rider is coming now to the US a one-night nationwide screening in fathom events.

225
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,869
Scott: Yep, so the way that works technologically is fathom events.

226
00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:53,780
Scott: basically live streams it but you can only watch the live stream from a movie theater.

227
00:16:54,042 --> 00:16:59,971
Scott: There's no way to watch it from your house without extreme hacking Decryption and whatnot.

228
00:17:00,032 --> 00:17:04,737
Scott: So The premiere is gonna be at the Japan Society here in New York City.

229
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:10,099
Rym: I already bought a ticket So I have to confirm exactly because I got to go to Colorado for my cousin's wedding.

230
00:17:10,241 --> 00:17:13,039
Rym: So I might be a bit home in time to see it.

231
00:17:13,361 --> 00:17:18,420
Rym: But if I am I'll be like landing from Colorado that morning, but in that case in which case I'm gonna get a ticket.

232
00:17:19,101 --> 00:17:23,800
Scott: Yeah, the thing is my knowledge of Kamen Rider is you know, very basic level knowledge, right?

233
00:17:24,201 --> 00:17:30,780
Scott: So, you know hero guy on a motorcycle looks like a bug has like a watch or a belt or something that transforms him.

234
00:17:30,903 --> 00:17:31,198
Rym: You know what?

235
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:31,983
Rym: I don't even care.

236
00:17:32,043 --> 00:17:34,354
Rym: I would go I would go see this and I think you should do.

237
00:17:34,414 --> 00:17:44,499
Scott: if you're out there and you you have The opportunity and it's like even though, you know, Shin Ultraman was you know, okay, but not up to my I guess You know, I don't know what expectation I had.

238
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,915
Scott: But even if this is you know, if this is as good as Shin Ultraman I won't feel bad about going to see it.

239
00:17:54,238 --> 00:18:00,733
Rym: Ah but anyway things of the day.

240
00:18:00,834 --> 00:18:07,457
Rym: so, uh Scott and I are actually compared to the ad that what I assume is the mean age of the listener.

241
00:18:07,477 --> 00:18:10,279
Rym: I Feel like we're pretty old.

242
00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:19,300
Rym: so This is gonna definitely cement in anyone's mind exactly how old we are because this is a YouTube video.

243
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:31,538
Rym: it's only two minutes long and it steps through a Full example of what every type of modem sounded like from the 300 baud era up to the 56k era.

244
00:18:31,959 --> 00:18:42,381
Rym: and if you don't know what a modem is then that's not even how badly we're gonna date ourselves, but This hit me so hard in the nostalgia.

245
00:18:42,923 --> 00:19:01,790
Rym: So, uh, my first modem was a 2400 baud modem and I kind of forgot what it sounded like because in my head like in my mind, I realized I only remembered what 33 6 and 56 K modems sounded like to a 2400 baud sounds way different.

246
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:04,534
Rym: But as soon as I heard it You know that phenomenon.

247
00:19:04,574 --> 00:19:16,107
Rym: we like you can't remember the name of something and someone says the first syllable of it and your brains like Oh, I remember now it was that Memories of childhood came flooding back and I he actually had the 14 for modem.

248
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:19,623
Scott: We didn't actually use it right away.

249
00:19:19,664 --> 00:19:21,593
Scott: we had the computer we had the modem But we didn't have.

250
00:19:21,613 --> 00:19:24,525
Scott: we weren't using it right and then eventually, you know, we got it.

251
00:19:24,646 --> 00:19:25,449
Scott: We started using it.

252
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,780
Scott: We started using it when everyone else is buying 28 8 modems.

253
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:27,961
Scott: Yeah 14.

254
00:19:27,961 --> 00:19:31,234
Rym: So 2400 baud was a v22.

255
00:19:31,355 --> 00:19:37,559
Rym: that was like 1982. you're 14 for there was that.

256
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,667
Rym: that was the second like class v32.

257
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:45,326
Rym: That was 9.6 and 14 for they're basically the same kind of modem.

258
00:19:46,009 --> 00:19:50,541
Scott: Yep But yeah, and then I bought a USB 56 K modem and like 1999 that was all cool and transparent.

259
00:19:50,561 --> 00:20:07,764
Rym: I Never stick on it in my life had or used a 56 K modem because he's it's K Modem could play tribes to online with a bad Like a 300 ping but it worked.

260
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:11,570
Scott: it worked Tribes - is surprisingly resilient to bad things.

261
00:20:12,592 --> 00:20:15,487
Scott: Yep, I bought an Ethernet card and went to college.

262
00:20:15,608 --> 00:20:33,565
Rym: see so 3028 8 and 33 6 came out in 1994 and in 1994 we got a v34 modem to do that and I use that up until like 1996. and then we got a cable modem because the pilot program was in our neighborhood.

263
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:39,371
Rym: So never had 56 K. I had broadband in 19 late 1996.

264
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:49,378
Scott: So my thing of the day is a website called make it from comm right and let's say that you're some sort of engineer or Manufacturer or something and you you know, you need to.

265
00:20:49,719 --> 00:20:52,690
Scott: you need to choose a material to make something out of right?

266
00:20:53,270 --> 00:21:06,390
Scott: it's like well this website has a database of materials right and Publicly collected public data about the material property, you know the properties of those materials, right?

267
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:08,848
Scott: So for example, let's see magnesium alloys.

268
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:15,246
Scott: I'm clicking on magnesium alloy a z9 1d and we can see it's Brunel hardness.

269
00:21:15,326 --> 00:21:16,910
Scott: It's compressive crushing strength.

270
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,655
Scott: It's Young's tensile modulus.

271
00:21:18,715 --> 00:21:21,061
Scott: It's elongation at break its impact strength.

272
00:21:21,703 --> 00:21:24,150
Scott: It's thermal properties electrical properties.

273
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:30,160
Scott: it's otherwise unclassified property is like it's base metal price and Etc, etc.

274
00:21:30,991 --> 00:21:36,990
Scott: It's composition mostly magnesium with a little bit of aluminum and then some really tiny amounts of zinc manganese silicon, etc.

275
00:21:37,933 --> 00:21:47,957
Scott: right and you can see this for a bunch of materials and you can compare the materials to each other and Make your choice about what you're gonna, you know Choose embodied energy.

276
00:21:47,997 --> 00:21:50,430
Rym: embodied energy is a measure of the amount of electrical energy consumed.

277
00:21:51,013 --> 00:21:54,069
Rym: It just tells you everything and it defines everything.

278
00:21:54,671 --> 00:22:02,970
Scott: They collected all this data from public places and compiled it onto a text easy to use good UI website.

279
00:22:04,051 --> 00:22:09,310
Scott: That is extremely useful if you do anything with metal ceramic plastic, etc.

280
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:10,353
Scott: I'm gonna say right now.

281
00:22:10,654 --> 00:22:15,108
Rym: This is web 4.0 back to 1.0 but with modern technology.

282

Scott: just here's the This website plain text sports.

283
00:22:18,021 --> 00:22:20,070
Scott: This is how this is the direct direction to go in.

284
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,479
Rym: I think I think it is the right direction.

285
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:22,344
Rym: Like I'm dead.

286
00:22:22,385 --> 00:22:23,190
Rym: This is not a joke.

287
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:27,349
Scott: We're dead serious about this old but websites had it right from the beginning.

288
00:22:27,489 --> 00:22:29,767
Rym: Yep Web 2.0 was an experiment.

289
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:33,222
Rym: odd If you don't know what web 2.0 is because that's actually a long time ago.

290
00:22:33,543 --> 00:22:38,620
Rym: Look at the current gig nights website From 2020 from May 2023.

291
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:44,750
Rym: I got to clarify cuz that might change in the near future But I miss that wet internet.

292
00:22:46,232 --> 00:22:48,924
Scott: If you ever ask yourself the question, what should I make it from?

293
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:50,130
Scott: go to make it from dot-com?

294
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:56,047
Rym: In the moment the geek dies book club book the satanic versus the next Thursday show.

295
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:56,710

296
00:22:56,852 --> 00:22:57,468
Rym: We're done with the book.

297
00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:05,090
Rym: It's a great finish reading every verse that Satan had to offer and I I thoroughly enjoyed the satanic verses.

298
00:23:05,312 --> 00:23:08,742
Rym: And you know, I will admit Having not known a lot about the book.

299
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:11,917
Rym: when we came into this book club I thought I knew the meta around the book.

300
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:19,430
Rym: anything about the kind imagined it would be like reading any Classic important book in that I would enjoy it and I'd think a lot.

301
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:24,305
Rym: But I'd also have to approach it from like a. I am analyzing this as I read your perspective.

302
00:23:24,566 --> 00:23:25,850
Rym: No, it's just a fucking fantasy book.

303
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:28,605
Rym: I just read it like a fantasy book and it was fantastic as a fantasy book.

304
00:23:28,646 --> 00:23:31,462
Rym: It's just Just cry me the allegory is there.

305
00:23:31,562 --> 00:23:31,985
Rym: it's deep.

306
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:32,830
Rym: It's dense.

307
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:37,770
Rym: But I think the thing that stood out the most And we'll get into the met.

308
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:52,390
Rym: you know the actual show when we do the book club episode was that it was one of those books and I like it when this happens to me where I'd be reading and I'm go Vibing going along and then the book would throw something at me and I get like half a paragraph past it.

309
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:53,670
Rym: Then I'd pause but wait a minute.

310
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:55,696
Rym: What the fuck just happened and I back up.

311
00:23:55,736 --> 00:23:59,789
Rym: cuz something crazy just happened and I had to back up and like be ready for it.

312
00:24:00,592 --> 00:24:04,390
Rym: Mm-hmm that happened a bunch of times in this book and it was great.

313
00:24:04,972 --> 00:24:08,183

320
00:24:24,225 --> 00:24:38,829
Rym: so you're all aware I'm gonna link to a thread in the GeekNights forum which you should join partly because Twitter is a dying husk of its former self and I barely use social media anymore and I'm Diving back into forums and discords and you know all that other stuff.

321
00:24:39,472 --> 00:24:51,182
Rym: So in the in this thread I have posted many examples of the new thumbnails that I've been creating for GeekNights stuff and I've got a lot of good feedback from the listener.

322
00:24:51,302 --> 00:24:58,747
Rym: and I've been making them better and better Because it's literally driving traffic to our old lectures that people forgot about in a surprising way.

Rym: So I'm just gonna keep doing it.

324
00:25:01,412 --> 00:25:07,752

326
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:26,168
Scott: you know how gonna have to do after releasing but I want to basically only narrow down to the things that are required for releasing only and we just got to do those and we can release and replace the old website and then We can go and do all those other things after and it'll be fine.

327
00:25:26,289 --> 00:25:32,988

374
00:27:32,696 --> 00:27:42,184
Scott: back in the early 2000s Makoto shinkai made short animations in his basement By himself possibly with his spouse partner.

375
00:27:42,204 --> 00:27:49,988
Rym: Yep in the 90s There were a couple of really small short films But the one that you all know was voices of a distant star Hoshino Koei.

376
00:27:50,008 --> 00:27:57,704
Rym: in The first time we ever saw anything by you know Makoto We were in college and there was this buzz about this short thing and someone fans up did.

377
00:27:57,764 --> 00:27:59,330
Scott: it was like five minutes over ten.

378
00:27:59,350 --> 00:27:59,913
Scott: I know how long.

379
00:27:59,933 --> 00:28:00,657

Scott: They played it at the anime club.

382
00:28:03,031 --> 00:28:14,850
Scott: Everyone was blown away by this very short anime like people were like everybody was crying Yeah, and everyone was like someone made that in their basement by themselves and they even voice acted at themselves.

383
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:17,258
Scott: But then the voice acting got replaced by professionals later.

384
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:20,670
Scott: Yeah, it's like oh and it's like that was one person doing holy.

385
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:22,489
Scott: Everyone is losing their mind over this thing.

386
00:28:22,911 --> 00:28:30,334
Scott: And then we waited to see what Makoto shinkai would do next and and it was a guy Ritchie situation.

Rym: I like it.

394
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:01,705

395
00:29:02,026 --> 00:29:04,313
Scott: I mean sure it's like, you know but he wasn't.

00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:15,666
Scott: Yes Like there are many good parts of it, but I agree Rym the biggest bad part was the message.

435
00:31:15,767 --> 00:31:18,555
Scott: the message was Humans will find a way to survive.

436
00:31:18,595 --> 00:31:20,260
Scott: don't bother trying to fix you.

437
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:24,050
Rym: don't sacrifice your own happiness to prevent climate change.

438
00:31:24,833 --> 00:31:32,509
Scott: right because humans will find a way to survive even if this terrible climate disaster and it's like That's the wrong message by a lot.

439
00:31:33,911 --> 00:31:38,843
Scott: So it comes up with another movie and all we know about this movie going in is it's another.

440
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:46,324
Scott: Makoto Shinkai joint and two It's one of the characters turns into a chair a literal chair made of wood.

441
00:31:46,485 --> 00:31:52,030
Scott: the thing you sit on a Small one that a child would sit on like that would go at a child's desk like a tiny one.

442
00:31:52,090 --> 00:32:00,439
Scott: Yeah right a character a human is transformed magically into a Piece of furniture that a child would sit on.

443
00:32:01,021 --> 00:32:03,249
Scott: and that's the two things, you know about this movie going in.

444
00:32:04,731 --> 00:32:09,790
Scott: And I'm like, well Makoto Shinkai is coming to the museum near me for the East Coast premiere.

445
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:10,853
Scott: Whatever, right?

446
00:32:11,374 --> 00:32:14,563
Scott: I'll go see it and I'll see what he's got to say now.

447
00:32:14,583 --> 00:32:17,010
Scott: I haven't seen this guy in ten years plus, right?

448
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:18,434
Scott: We'll see what's going on.

449
00:32:18,534 --> 00:32:19,077
Rym: And you know what?

450
00:32:19,157 --> 00:32:20,482
Rym: Honestly, it was pretty great.

451
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:22,250
Rym: Like I think it's one of his best works.

452
00:32:22,852 --> 00:32:25,198
Scott: Also, I get actually like it better than your name.

453
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,284
Rym: I also like it better than your name.

454
00:32:27,665 --> 00:32:28,548
Rym: I see what like.

455
00:32:28,628 --> 00:32:35,230
Rym: I see Why your name would probably be seen by many film people as a better constructed movie.

456
00:32:35,692 --> 00:32:36,497
Scott: I think you might have just.

457
00:32:36,919 --> 00:32:45,390
Scott: I also highly suspect it could have been a timing issue If this had come out when your name came out and your name came out Now would the would the box office grosses have just been reversed?

458
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:50,410
Rym: It's hard to say like I. actually I would struggle to take a strong stance on that question.

459
00:32:51,292 --> 00:32:52,997
Rym: And also it's doing great.

460
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:57,689
Rym: It is already itself the fourth highest grossing Japanese film of all time.

461
00:32:58,572 --> 00:33:07,710
Scott: Yep, I think the one thing that might keep it that might hurt it at the box office compared to your name Is that it's a little bit Japanese centric, right?

462
00:33:08,275 --> 00:33:09,850
Scott: Your name is sort of universal.

463
00:33:10,072 --> 00:33:11,164
Rym: So there's a lot going on here.

464
00:33:11,285 --> 00:33:13,897
Rym: at the end We're gonna talk about some of the spoilery things.

465
00:33:13,977 --> 00:33:15,442
Rym: cuz one just go see this movie like.

466
00:33:15,824 --> 00:33:18,634
Scott: it's not really a spoilery kind of movie But it's not like.

467
00:33:19,356 --> 00:33:19,818
Scott: there's nothing.

468
00:33:19,838 --> 00:33:23,050
Scott: there's no surprise or a secret that's revealed or anything like that.

469
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:25,604
Scott: It's just you know, it's about character development.

470
00:33:25,664 --> 00:33:26,730
Rym: Yeah, there's a few things.

471
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:31,390
Rym: I don't even any really any major events in the movie, but there are a few things I wouldn't really want.

472
00:33:31,811 --> 00:33:36,168
Rym: I think it would be better for people to not know going in but we'll get to that at the end.

473
00:33:36,188 --> 00:33:37,393
Rym: like but what I Would say is one.

474
00:33:37,434 --> 00:33:37,816
Rym: it's great.

475
00:33:37,856 --> 00:33:38,761
Rym: But - you know what it is.

476
00:33:38,781 --> 00:33:40,350
Rym: It's a road trip movie.

477
00:33:40,671 --> 00:33:45,063
Rym: This is about people going on a road trip to process trauma from their past.

478
00:33:45,825 --> 00:33:46,227
Scott: That's correct.

479
00:33:46,247 --> 00:33:52,993
Rym: That's what this movie is And it's it does it and it so well and the characters are To.

480
00:33:53,334 --> 00:33:57,050
Rym: every single character in the show is a fantastic character.

481
00:33:57,732 --> 00:34:03,767
Scott: Yeah, I think some of the characters were sort of thrown in not fully developed or necessary, but they were still.

482
00:34:04,068 --> 00:34:04,970
Scott: I still enjoyed them.

483
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:05,793
Scott: So I guess they could.

484
00:34:05,813 --> 00:34:12,810
Scott: they had purpose in that like for the best example, obviously is you know The show idle music right car, right?

485
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:20,545
Scott: It's like we did that like that guy sort of came in in The like way late in the movie to introduce a character with speaking lines, right?

486
00:34:20,606 --> 00:34:25,989
Scott: Pretty much And it wasn't that significant and you probably could have had the movie without him.

487
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:34,989
Scott: like it sort of felt a little bit awkward like but at Sort of worked because he was not awkward just to the audience showing up late.

488
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:41,277
Scott: But that's his relationship with the main character is like an awkward guy who shows up late Yeah, and at a weird time.

489
00:34:41,297 --> 00:34:47,886
Scott: and but he was a very enjoyable character, you know Cuz he was sort of you know, like that wacky side character almost right?

490
00:34:47,946 --> 00:34:52,710
Scott: He was a lot of fun But you know, he could have not been there and it would have still been fine.

491
00:34:52,772 --> 00:35:00,102
Rym: Yeah so and the I guess the other main thing that I think really made this stand out is that And Makoto Shinkai did this was your name too.

492
00:35:00,243 --> 00:35:04,800
Rym: in that in your name, you know There's magic key stuff happening and it is literally happening.

493
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,244
Rym: The movie makes it quite abundant.

494
00:35:06,505 --> 00:35:08,190
Rym: That's not like allegory.

495
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:12,407
Rym: I mean it is allegory, but it also literally directly happened.

496
00:35:12,447 --> 00:35:16,000
Rym: like characters Remember the specifics of the magic that happened.

497
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:16,542
Rym: It is real.

498
00:35:17,023 --> 00:35:18,729
Rym: this movie does the same thing.

499
00:35:19,512 --> 00:35:37,470
Rym: There's a moment where the characters who have not been involved in the magic BS Encounter the magic BS and their response is whoa, there's some magic BS going on Mm-hmm, and I think the message of this one like unlike weathering with you was also good.

500
00:35:37,851 --> 00:35:38,835
Rym: I think it was actually a new.

501
00:35:39,257 --> 00:35:40,421
Scott: yes this had the message.

502
00:35:40,441 --> 00:35:41,084
Scott: Yes good.

503
00:35:41,445 --> 00:35:42,670
Rym: No, and it was multiple messages.

504
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:51,590
Rym: there were messages about unpacking trauma and facing trauma messages about like Talking to family and talking to people and making human connections.

505
00:35:51,991 --> 00:35:58,850
Rym: But there was also messages about if there's a problem go deal with it, which was kind of the opposite message of weathering with you.

506
00:36:00,852 --> 00:36:03,424
Rym: I'm comparing the two a lot because I do feel like this was.

507
00:36:03,444 --> 00:36:06,828
Scott: I don't know if you With you that much you can't get away from.

508
00:36:06,888 --> 00:36:09,338
Scott: yeah but I almost said that's a that's a Rym thing.

509
00:36:09,398 --> 00:36:19,337
Scott: Rym find Rym will find a thing and have a have a Criticism of it and then just keep bringing it up cuz things get stuck in my craw and whether it's right It's in your craw and it never gets it bother.

510
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:29,668
Rym: it specially bothered me because since weathering with you came out Like a lot of things in the real world have gotten worse and worse and worse in a way that people need to make sacrifices to try to stop.

511
00:36:30,531 --> 00:36:40,605
Scott: Yep, but it's like basically any time weathering with you comes up or any time something reminds Rym of weathering with you It'll pop out of his craw and have like oh the message of that movie.

512
00:36:40,646 --> 00:36:41,450
Scott: I hated it for this.

513
00:36:41,652 --> 00:36:47,890
Scott: Yeah, I forgot that was in my craw But it came back out and it's like everyone's already heard you say that the last time it popped out of the crock.

514
00:36:50,094 --> 00:36:51,341
Rym: So what is this actually about?

515
00:36:51,401 --> 00:36:52,065
Rym: like really like.

516
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:58,478
Rym: it's a road trip movie But basically this girl and it gets right to the point This movie does not belabor getting to the magic.

517
00:36:58,518 --> 00:37:06,220
Scott: nice girl's only remaining family is her aunt and she lives with her aunt and goes To school as a teenage dish like young teen.

518
00:37:06,261 --> 00:37:06,762
Scott: How old is she?

519
00:37:06,782 --> 00:37:10,333
Scott: like 14 13 17 high school I don't know.

520
00:37:10,373 --> 00:37:14,848
Scott: She's she's teenage aged right and she lives with her aunt only.

521
00:37:14,909 --> 00:37:30,810
Rym: Yep And like in school cool meets a weird guy who's clearly up to something in a anime magical way Interacts with him briefly, but then just continues on to school and then at school and the guy has something weird He's like hey, is there any?

522
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:35,925
Rym: Abandoned ruins around here and she's like, yeah that way weird question to ask but whatever.

523
00:37:35,945 --> 00:37:50,134
Rym: and then she goes to school And there's kind of an earthquake and then she sees a bunch of magical shit happening off in the distance in the direction of the ruin, she pointed the weird guy at and nobody else can see this biz and she's like Fuck school.

524
00:37:50,516 --> 00:37:52,242
Rym: I'm gonna immediately go look into this.

525
00:37:52,985 --> 00:37:54,250
Rym: which is the correct thing to do?

526
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:59,489
Scott: Yes, or unless you're actually hallucinating in which case would be the wrong thing to do?

527
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:00,777
Rym: Well, I would do one of two things.

528
00:38:00,938 --> 00:38:04,939
Scott: I would either a good thing that within the world of the movie She wasn't hallucinating and the magic was real.

529
00:38:04,959 --> 00:38:05,482
Rym: I'll tell you what.

530
00:38:05,643 --> 00:38:12,190
Rym: I would go and check it out And if there was nothing weird going on there, I would immediately go straight to the doctor.

531
00:38:13,076 --> 00:38:15,130
Scott: What if you went there and you were still hallucinating the shit?

532
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:18,405
Scott: How would you know it was real or not if the hallucination were that self-consistent?

533
00:38:18,586 --> 00:38:19,250
Rym: I'm fucked anyway.

534
00:38:20,912 --> 00:38:24,170
Scott: Yeah, the point is the moving chair sort of confirmed, right?

535
00:38:27,614 --> 00:38:35,970
Rym: See the moving chair like people are basically like posting on Twitter Like I saw a fucking moving chair and like she sees it everywhere, right?

536
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:41,850
Scott: The guy was fighting the evils that are underneath the earth that are coming and causing disaster through these magic doors.

537
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:43,957
Rym: There's a whole like mad magical plot and he's got.

538
00:38:43,977 --> 00:38:55,539
Scott: he's got to make sure the doors stay closed and whatnot, you know and sealed yeah, and He gets turned into a chair because she does something, you know She messes around with the keystone or whatever.

539
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,363
Scott: when she should have she.

540
00:38:56,383 --> 00:39:01,570
Rym: basically she picks up a rock That's kind of shaped like a cat and she's like wonder what this is and then it thaws.

541
00:39:01,731 --> 00:39:03,950
Rym: This all happens like the first six minutes of the movie.

542
00:39:04,771 --> 00:39:11,089
Rym: Yeah, it like thaws and turns into a magic looking cat that says cryptic stuff and runs away and then all hell breaks loose.

543
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,609
Rym: and Then the magic guys like what the fuck did you do?

544
00:39:14,851 --> 00:39:17,166
Scott: Yeah, you fucked up the magic and now the evils coming out.

545
00:39:17,187 --> 00:39:19,440
Scott: It's your fault Oh, but I got turned into a chair.

546
00:39:19,521 --> 00:39:20,406
Scott: So now you have to fix it.

547
00:39:20,426 --> 00:39:20,950
Scott: I can't fix it.

548
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:21,390
Scott: I'm a chair.

549
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:22,575
Rym: So now it's a road trip.

550
00:39:22,595 --> 00:39:31,850
Rym: try even though I'm a chair and then the the magic cat Runs off and gets on a ferry and then the chairs like we got to do something about this show.

551
00:39:32,031 --> 00:39:40,023
Rym: She grabs the chair and the two of them run onto the ferry and then the ferry basically goes like Four hours away like it goes way where it becomes.

552
00:39:40,043 --> 00:39:43,659
Scott: it's like in the one end is a road trip But on the other hand, it's a chase right?

553
00:39:43,699 --> 00:39:44,202
Scott: It's like the.

554
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:45,509
Scott: you know her and the chair.

555
00:39:46,091 --> 00:39:48,339
Scott: Well, she's chasing the cat and she's carrying the chair.

556
00:39:48,379 --> 00:39:50,687
Scott: The chair is also chasing the out but it's a chair.

557
00:39:51,068 --> 00:39:54,083
Rym: It's a guy It's and she very smartly is like you're a chair.

558
00:39:54,143 --> 00:39:55,429
Rym: What the fuck are you gonna do?

559
00:39:56,531 --> 00:39:56,812
Scott: Right.

560
00:39:56,852 --> 00:40:06,790
Rym: So because she's not lucid she's going for and then the ant is worried Which is this is why it's such a road trip movie because she calls her on late at night on the ferry.

561
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:09,618
Rym: She's like, yeah, I'm like staying over at so-and-so's house.

562
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:10,761
Rym: I'll be back tomorrow.

563
00:40:11,162 --> 00:40:24,378
Rym: And then the next day she wakes up like a hundred miles away from home like and then Doesn't make it home that night and she calls her on like that night's like yeah Not gonna make it home again.

564
00:40:24,398 --> 00:40:25,764
Rym: and then it's like where are you?

565
00:40:25,784 --> 00:40:27,170
Rym: and there's this great scene?

566
00:40:27,631 --> 00:40:35,665
Rym: Where she like cuz this keeps happening to the point where the on acts like a normal adult and it's like you get your ass Home right now or like I'm coming after you.

567
00:40:35,886 --> 00:40:36,430
Rym: What's wrong?

568
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:41,127
Rym: Yeah and then she like sends his long text to the aunt and then she's like turns the phone off.

569
00:40:41,489 --> 00:40:42,914
Rym: like doesn't want to deal with it.

570
00:40:43,376 --> 00:40:52,250
Rym: and later on like she opens the phone and there is like a 400 line text waiting for her and she's reading it like oh my god.

571
00:40:52,531 --> 00:41:02,590
Rym: And before she could even begin to respond another 400 line text like appears from the aunt and she's just like oh shit And there's lots of just fun moments like that.

572
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:11,299
Rym: all the characters act like they live in the modern world where cell phones and reddit and Twitter and things exist and It's just a very like modern sense, but it's not.

573
00:41:11,319 --> 00:41:17,050
Scott: yeah, it's not but it's not like, you know Bell where it's about the internet It's just it's a very much takes place like in the real world.

574
00:41:17,552 --> 00:41:20,703
Scott: People have modern technology because it's taking place in 20 22 3 whatever year.

575
00:41:20,743 --> 00:41:28,026
Rym: Yep so and yeah Yeah the movie just keeps going from there and it.

576
00:41:28,288 --> 00:41:28,490
Rym: so the

577
00:41:28,891 --> 00:41:44,534
Scott: Chair thing seems like so ridiculous from the trailer or from just hearing that that a guy turns into a chair But when you see the movie first of all He's not a chair actually for you know is a chair for a smaller portion of the movie than you think But

578
00:41:44,594 --> 00:41:46,730
Rym: it is still like a good chunk of the movie.

579
00:41:47,471 --> 00:41:52,610
Scott: Yeah, it's it's you know a big chunk, but it's less than he turns on chairs at some point, right?

580
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:55,000
Rym: Yeah, well cuz really it's not about him.

581
00:41:55,020 --> 00:42:00,573
Rym: It's about the girl and her aunt's exactly But it's less.

582
00:42:00,653 --> 00:42:02,278
Scott: It's a lot less silly in context.

583
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:02,920
Scott: Obviously.

584
00:42:03,361 --> 00:42:03,803
Scott: Yeah, right.

585
00:42:03,923 --> 00:42:04,886
Scott: It's not it's not.

586
00:42:04,906 --> 00:42:07,755
Scott: it don't go in thinking It's some nonsense thing.

587
00:42:08,016 --> 00:42:08,738
Rym: It's yep.

588
00:42:08,838 --> 00:42:10,683
Scott: And and what there has as a meaning?

589
00:42:10,703 --> 00:42:28,396
Rym: there's a reason it's a chair the chair has a Literal plot reason that literally it has to be a chair and it also has a very profound allegorical reason that it's a chair and it's also a. Well, we talked about this when we were.

590
00:42:28,597 --> 00:42:32,530
Rym: there was a news about how he said he made the director.

591
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:34,458
Rym: She think I said he made it news.

592
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:37,370
Scott: that news was slightly different from what he said when I saw y'all.

593
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:44,844
Rym: So it's and he said slightly different things every time he's talked about it And actually read a ton more interviews since then.

594
00:42:44,864 --> 00:42:46,190
Rym: so I guess I'll address it now.

595
00:42:46,831 --> 00:42:54,450
Rym: My personal best summary based on reading four different interviews where he explained this different ways through translation.

596
00:42:54,993 --> 00:43:02,860
Rym: so like take this with a pretty good chunk of salt is The producer told him you've got to have a romantic interest.

597
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:06,570
Rym: You can't just make the other character a girl which obviously that's a can of worms.

598
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:11,650
Rym: But shinkai was like but I don't want to do a romance and the producer kind of forced him to.

599
00:43:12,091 --> 00:43:21,143
Rym: So he was like I got to make it something else and he thought about making it like the guy gets turned into a monster Or the guy gets turned into like random objects as they move along.

600
00:43:21,324 --> 00:43:23,190
Rym: anything to make him not a hot boy.

601
00:43:23,652 --> 00:43:27,610
Rym: So there isn't romantic tension during the story because he didn't want that to happen.

602
00:43:27,931 --> 00:43:32,023
Rym: He did not want to distract from the story of the girl and her aunt with a will.

603
00:43:32,043 --> 00:43:33,087
Rym: they won't they romance?

604
00:43:34,009 --> 00:43:34,170
Rym: and he?

605
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:39,026
Rym: Settled on a chair and then he came up with a really good reason why it had to be a chair.

606
00:43:39,508 --> 00:43:53,575
Rym: and if you didn't Know that back story if you've never read one of those articles or heard any of those interviews You would think it was a chair from day one because the chair is crucial to everything This movie is about in profound Direct ways.

607
00:43:54,017 --> 00:43:54,438
Rym: I would have been.

608
00:43:54,539 --> 00:43:59,809
Rym: I would be surprised if I learned after seeing it that The chair was because of all these other reasons.

609
00:44:00,533 --> 00:44:03,224
Scott: So the vibe I got when we saw him in person didn't they?

610
00:44:03,545 --> 00:44:04,610
Scott: obviously through a translator?

611
00:44:04,771 --> 00:44:13,522
Scott: He yeah, he spoke to us right was that you know he had all he has the signature thing He always does clouds romance lover separated by space and time.

612
00:44:13,762 --> 00:44:19,664
Scott: every single one of these movies every single one of his works Except maybe some TV commercials even some of those have it right.

613
00:44:19,704 --> 00:44:22,919
Scott: it's like and he like Didn't want to do what he's always done.

614
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:28,610
Rym: He wanted to do something you want to do clouds Family trauma and family like stop.

615
00:44:28,731 --> 00:44:29,377
Scott: I don't know if you want.

616
00:44:29,397 --> 00:44:32,682
Scott: I don't even know if you want to do the clouds But they want to do the clouds heat.

617
00:44:32,863 --> 00:44:36,936
Scott: He said that the producer You know was like listen.

618
00:44:37,237 --> 00:44:39,305
Scott: I know you want to do something different, but it's like.

619
00:44:39,626 --> 00:44:40,630
Scott: this is what you're known for.

620
00:44:40,971 --> 00:44:41,695
Scott: You're good at it.

621
00:44:41,937 --> 00:44:42,942
Scott: That's what's successful.

622
00:44:42,962 --> 00:44:44,310
Scott: This is still capitalism.

623
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:51,910
Rym: It's telling that every single movie poster shows the girl and the guy in non-chair form like standing next to each other in some fashion.

624
00:44:52,732 --> 00:44:53,434
Scott: Yeah, he's like.

625
00:44:53,795 --> 00:45:04,870
Scott: you still have to include that to some extent and so he included those his trademark things To basically this minimal extent to where you know his stamp is on it.

626
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:07,088
Scott: You can tell immediately that this is a shinkai work.

627
00:45:07,832 --> 00:45:13,570
Scott: But you it is not the focus of the work the way it is in a lot of the others, right?

628
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:16,845
Scott: It's just sort of off to the side and is not center stage.

629
00:45:16,885 --> 00:45:17,769
Scott: It's like side stage.

630
00:45:19,332 --> 00:45:21,519
Scott: And the other things he interestingly said.

631
00:45:21,579 --> 00:45:27,661
Scott: the biggest interesting thing he said when he spoke was that You know back that we talked about for Hokushino Koei.

632
00:45:27,681 --> 00:45:29,950
Scott: He made it like in his basement by himself, right?

633
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:32,258
Scott: mostly He said that basic.

634
00:45:32,378 --> 00:45:34,386
Scott: the way he made this is the way he makes everything.

635
00:45:34,828 --> 00:45:35,009
Scott: is he?

636
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:40,850
Scott: Storyboarded the whole thing in his basement or wherever his studio in his house by himself, right?

637
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:41,915
Scott: He voice acted.

638
00:45:42,337 --> 00:45:48,150
Scott: every character recorded it at home With his own microphone by himself, right?

639
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:56,669
Scott: And basically once he had a storyboard with everything voice acted for the whole movie and it was all done Which took like two years?

640
00:45:57,711 --> 00:46:04,583
Scott: Then he brings in the whole animation studio Right with everyone else and they make the real movie from that.

641
00:46:05,104 --> 00:46:06,910
Scott: so he still does it that way.

642
00:46:07,331 --> 00:46:08,896
Scott: Nobody else does it that way.

643
00:46:08,936 --> 00:46:13,650
Scott: that I'm aware of and at least not for movies not even not for TV episodes either.

644
00:46:13,816 --> 00:46:15,927
Scott: so That's wild.

645
00:46:16,992 --> 00:46:23,485
Scott: Yeah, that he still does that And somehow gets away with it, but I guess they don't want to mess with success.

646
00:46:23,526 --> 00:46:31,890
Rym: So they let it keep going and What else could we say other than doing a very long like final thoughts style?

647
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:34,473
Rym: Like let's dive into all the allegory dude I feel.

648
00:46:34,735 --> 00:46:42,187
Scott: the only other thing I would say is that compared to his other movies Which I think some of the other ones had parts that didn't make sense didn't fit together.

649
00:46:42,267 --> 00:46:48,670
Scott: We're a little bit nonsensical We're a bit a little bit muddy and he could have used a lot of editing, right?

650
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:52,198
Scott: This one did not need as the editing so much.

651
00:46:52,299 --> 00:47:00,882
Scott: It was very well put together, you know tightly structured Well paced except for maybe a little part when then towards the end, but not really.

652
00:47:01,423 --> 00:47:03,950
Scott: so he's definitely his most well structured.

653
00:47:04,372 --> 00:47:11,673
Rym: Uh, I mean the movie is a hundred and twenty two minutes like it's long But I had no point was I Only?

654
00:47:11,693 --> 00:47:18,782
Rym: I looked at my watch once the movie just washed over me to the end and I didn't realize how long it was until Like we walked out of the theater and I was like, wait a minute.

655
00:47:18,843 --> 00:47:20,350
Scott: It is long for an animated movie.

656
00:47:20,571 --> 00:47:32,066
Rym: So yeah, thankfully we saw it at the Alamo Drafthouse in Manhattan, which I didn't realize was in the Sub sub sub basement of like 28 Liberty down there.

657
00:47:32,527 --> 00:47:33,249
Rym: It's way deep.

658
00:47:35,611 --> 00:47:37,060
Scott: I Gonna go to the movie theater.

659
00:47:37,081 --> 00:47:45,992
Rym: I could walk to us but uh The I guess the last thing I would say is that what the movie is about cuz on one hand it is about The.

660
00:47:46,012 --> 00:47:48,284
Rym: you know, it's about the magical stuff like that literally happens.

661
00:47:48,706 --> 00:47:49,390
Scott: It's about the earthquake.

662
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:52,487
Rym: Yeah, it's about the the earthquake that caused the Fukushima disaster.

663
00:47:52,728 --> 00:47:57,418
Rym: like Directly in the plot but allegorically it's.

664
00:47:57,879 --> 00:47:58,420
Rym: it uses.

665
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:09,121
Rym: it almost uses the allegory of the girl and her aunt Dealing with their shared trauma but also society collectively dealing with its shared trauma of what happened.

666
00:48:09,481 --> 00:48:14,675
Rym: because like where her childhood home that was destroyed was is Directly relevant.

667
00:48:14,856 --> 00:48:21,289
Rym: and Ching Kai has talked a lot about how the 2011 earthquake Affected him and how it was a big part of the inspiration for this movie.

668
00:48:22,094 --> 00:48:24,510
Scott: Yeah, I mean, well, that's I think that's the thing that all happens.

669
00:48:24,711 --> 00:48:32,090
Scott: Is that anytime there's a major human event positive or negative but sadly especially the negative ones right that immediately?

670
00:48:32,491 --> 00:48:36,170
Scott: Sort of causes, you know artists filmmakers writers, right?

671
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:47,224
Scott: It's like, you know You could go cause a disaster on purpose or or what happens by accident and if anything is significant If it's remembered if it makes the news there's gonna be books about it.

672
00:48:47,244 --> 00:48:48,790
Scott: This might be a documentary.

673
00:48:49,131 --> 00:48:54,052
Rym: I mean, there's still like World War two movies are still very very common in the year 20.

674
00:48:54,052 --> 00:48:58,024
Scott: the bigger the bigger the event the bigger the the more art it spawns.

675
00:48:58,204 --> 00:49:09,600
Scott: right World War two was so big that the art Will probably never stop coming As long as they're just still people alive who as long as the thing that got everyone to forget about World War one doesn't happen.

676
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:22,530
Scott: Yeah But yeah, it's like so that that earthquake, you know, it's like the timing of it, right It's like if you would have come out with this movie too soon after the earthquake.

677
00:49:22,731 --> 00:49:26,730
Scott: You're in that sort of depending on the tone of your artwork that goes to a disaster.

678
00:49:27,275 --> 00:49:28,930
Scott: You sort of have to work on your timing.

679
00:49:29,391 --> 00:49:30,756
Scott: Yeah, so you can't.

680
00:49:31,117 --> 00:49:37,570
Scott: you can't come out with an animated movie about an earthquake, you know immediately after the earthquake You got to put some space between it, right?

681
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:41,281
Rym: I think that space was extra important for this movie because the movie was also.

682
00:49:41,301 --> 00:49:42,786
Rym: it wasn't just about unpacking trauma.

683
00:49:43,208 --> 00:49:47,255
Rym: It was about unpacking Distant trauma like the main character.

684
00:49:47,295 --> 00:49:48,479
Rym: She's unpacking trauma from.

685
00:49:48,499 --> 00:49:50,985
Rym: you know, she's 17 from like 10 12 years ago.

686
00:49:53,651 --> 00:50:00,600
Scott: Yep, well, I think that's the one thing he still kept in in, you know, the lovers in this movie They were not separated by space and time.

687
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:14,094
Scott: They were separated by one of them being a chair But the there was still a separation right between you know The the horrific events of the past and you know The main character.

688
00:50:14,234 --> 00:50:22,874
Scott: time wise right a time separation and a space separation Which she closes and the time separation which you know is Expanding.

689
00:50:22,934 --> 00:50:23,115
Scott: right.

690
00:50:23,175 --> 00:50:33,949
Scott: and it's different where when you have the lovers who are separated They're trying to connect and reach out to each other right over a long distance Whereas here it's like when it's a trauma you're trying to get away from

691
00:50:35,034 --> 00:50:45,304
Rym: And by trying to get away from it You end up heading straight toward it and then because magic stuff you get a little bit of a time a time loop type situation with the magic.

692
00:50:46,415 --> 00:50:54,970
Scott: Yeah, I Thoroughly enjoyed this movie and of course, yeah, I wouldn't say I wouldn't say that this is like some s-tier anime, right?

693
00:50:56,731 --> 00:51:02,030
Scott: But I would still say that like, you know, are you gonna see anime movies that came out this year?

694
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:04,139
Scott: It's like or you know, I guess within the past year.

695
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:04,822
Scott: It's or whatever.

696
00:51:04,842 --> 00:51:08,934
Scott: I don't know when it actually came out in Japan, but You know, it's.

697
00:51:09,074 --> 00:51:10,158
Scott: I guess it's the same.

698
00:51:10,218 --> 00:51:11,562
Scott: as you know, is it better than Bell?

699
00:51:11,602 --> 00:51:12,405
Scott: That's a close race.

700
00:51:12,685 --> 00:51:14,130
Scott: That's okay, right?

701
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:24,644
Rym: It's like, you know, I think part of what's going on here is because Hosoda and Shinkai are both Younger creators who are creating more modern work younger.

702
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:26,069
Scott: They're like, they're still.

703
00:51:26,089 --> 00:51:29,486
Rym: yeah they are but think about the vibe of both of them and their movies.

704
00:51:29,828 --> 00:51:33,400
Rym: like technologies use the way young people actually use it.

705
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:38,315
Rym: the world and the plot exists in a modern like Setting and it's.

706
00:51:38,475 --> 00:51:39,819
Rym: it's not like a lot of older.

707
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:47,402
Rym: older filmmakers will make a movie set in current day current time But like nobody has cell phones for some reason like that's still happening.

708
00:51:47,442 --> 00:51:55,210
Rym: Shinkai Shinkai is 50 and Hosoda is 55 But the movies still speak to a younger more modern sensibility in a very direct way.

709
00:52:01,275 --> 00:52:03,810
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

710
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:08,650
