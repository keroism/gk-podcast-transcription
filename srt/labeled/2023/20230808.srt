1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:08,884
Rym: It's Tuesday, August 8th, 2023.

2
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:09,104
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:14,155
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,664
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight.

5
00:00:15,684 --> 00:00:17,651
Rym: We are reviewing a game from 1995, Pitch Car.

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,898
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,586
Rym: So I realized today is 0808.

8
00:00:26,586 --> 00:00:27,220
Rym: And uh...

9
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,382
Scott: 808. 808.

10
00:00:30,382 --> 00:00:34,920
Rym: It came up when we were talking about all the anime that have the word "city" in their name kind of randomly.

11
00:00:35,022 --> 00:00:35,307
Scott: Demon City.

12
00:00:35,551 --> 00:00:36,080
Scott: City Hunter.

13
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:37,128
Rym: Demon City.

14
00:00:37,311 --> 00:00:37,999
Rym: Wicked City.

15
00:00:38,601 --> 00:00:39,198
Scott: Demon City.

16
00:00:40,664 --> 00:00:43,260
Scott: If there's an anime with "city" in the name, you know you're getting into something.

17
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:43,740
Rym: Yup.

18
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:45,831
Rym: It was the kind of thing we used to do.

19
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:54,880
Rym: Like, GeekNights in the earliest days was like equal parts gaming cons, anime cons, other stuff.

20
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,580
Rym: Like, we went to way more anime cons than we did gaming cons.

21
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:03,120
Rym: Partly because we didn't go to PAXes, mostly because we were too stupid to prioritize them sooner.

22
00:01:03,725 --> 00:01:05,220
Scott: They were expensive and far away.

23
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,057
Scott: We were poor.

24
00:01:06,543 --> 00:01:06,918
Rym: We were.

25
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:13,160
Rym: But if we had like stopped going to all those anime cons, we could have gone to just a PAX instead.

26
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,006
Rym: Eh.

27
00:01:14,361 --> 00:01:14,796
Rym: I think so.

28
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:30,660
Rym: But uh... We used to go to a lot of anime cons and when we were having that anime with the "city" in the title, that is the exact kind of panel that in the era where I cared about anime cons, that would be the panel I would be like, let's do a panel about all the anime with "city" in the title.

29
00:01:31,342 --> 00:01:31,747
Scott: Yeah.

30
00:01:32,112 --> 00:01:32,598
Scott: Let's do it.

31
00:01:33,866 --> 00:01:34,899
Rym: And uh, I don't know.

32
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,320
Rym: Like, I haven't seen any of those shows in more than a decade.

33
00:01:39,201 --> 00:01:40,349
Rym: Two of them are movies.

34
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,679
Rym: Most of them are movies, actually.

35
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:51,220
Rym: And I also don't think I have the energy to do a panel like that in the year 2023.

36
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:55,658
Rym: We've definitely skewed heavily toward gaming and technology as time has gone on.

37
00:01:57,244 --> 00:01:57,535
Scott: Yeah.

38
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,365
Rym: Yup.

39
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,279
Rym: Things change.

40
00:01:59,721 --> 00:02:01,204
Rym: But uh, there's a lot of news.

41
00:02:01,224 --> 00:02:09,259
Rym: We keep skipping shows off and on because life has come back full swing in the wind down from the hell era of COVID.

42
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:11,778
Scott: And uh... To the second hell era.

43
00:02:12,461 --> 00:02:13,802
Scott: Hell 2.

44
00:02:13,802 --> 00:02:15,980
Rym: I hope there is not a third hell era of that.

45
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:23,980
Scott: Oh no, it's just gonna be... Listen, from now until the day you leave this earth, whenever that is, it will just be a descent into further hells.

46
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,940
Scott: There is no changing of that.

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,320
Rym: The only thing I hope for now is I try to figure out for all the different threads of hell world.

48
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:38,740
Rym: Because we've got climate change hell world, we've got the repeated cyclical rise of fascism in various forms hell world.

49
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,100
Rym: We've got the internet is turning into nothing but one ad hell world.

50
00:02:42,521 --> 00:02:43,438
Rym: All the different hell worlds.

51
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:51,980
Rym: I'm just trying to hope that some of them hit their nators and at least bounce off of a local minimus.

52
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,952
Scott: But there are other hells.

53
00:02:53,972 --> 00:02:54,859
Scott: You don't even, you know.

54
00:02:55,161 --> 00:03:01,040
Rym: Yeah, there's so many we're not even thinking about right now because we're focused on the ones that are like actively affecting us.

55
00:03:01,842 --> 00:03:03,711
Rym: Like, "Oh, COVID is winding down.

56
00:03:03,731 --> 00:03:05,398
Rym: I can finally stop wearing masks

57
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:05,800
Rym: indoors.".

58
00:03:05,901 --> 00:03:08,936
Rym: And then the monkeys pause like, "Motherfucker, you're gonna have to wear a mask outdoors

59
00:03:09,016 --> 00:03:09,197
Rym: now.".

60
00:03:09,862 --> 00:03:10,377
Scott: That's right.

61
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,877
Rym: So speaking of hell world, there's a live streamer.

62
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,035
Rym: I guess this guy does video game streams.

63
00:03:17,075 --> 00:03:17,760
Rym: I've never heard of him.

64
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,340
Scott: I've never heard of him before either, but apparently he's like one of the most popular streamers.

65
00:03:23,082 --> 00:03:31,300
Rym: So here's my recollected, absorbed understanding of who Kai Sinat is as a streamer.

66
00:03:32,664 --> 00:03:35,720
Rym: This is just what I collected from interfacing with the world.

67
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,200
Rym: What I know about him is he was a streamer who did some video games.

68
00:03:40,523 --> 00:03:44,440
Rym: He set the record for the biggest stream ever on Twitch like kinda recently.

69
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,379
Rym: Like he's that big.

70
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,760
Scott: Basically this dude is the biggest deal on Twitch.

71
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:52,820
Rym: He also got banned from Twitch relatively recently for violating at least one term of service at one point.

72
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,000
Rym: I guess he got reinstated at some point.

73
00:03:56,826 --> 00:03:58,720
Scott: If you make a lot of money for them, you can get reinstated.

74
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,500
Rym: And I'm pretty confident he's not a great person just based on multiple factors that I learned.

75
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,364
Scott: I don't even know.

76
00:04:05,826 --> 00:04:08,240
Scott: I know very little about the person.

77
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,940
Scott: I don't know any positive things about him.

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,900
Rym: So here's a data point that is definitely not a red flag for this person's character.

79
00:04:16,581 --> 00:04:29,197
Rym: Kai Sinat apparently recently, like this just happened a few days ago, told his streamers, all his fans, he was gonna go to Union Square in New York City and give away like 500 PS5s.

80
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:40,060
Rym: Now there are so many fucking things wrong with saying those words out loud that I cannot even enumerate them all.

81
00:04:40,564 --> 00:04:41,880
Rym: But let's go through the important points.

82
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,919
Rym: One, he did not tell New York City he was doing this.

83
00:04:45,676 --> 00:04:45,779
Scott: No.

84
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:58,140
Rym: And two, he did not put forth even a minimal, like, barest effort to in any way plan how this was going to go down.

85
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:11,478
Rym: So one of the most popular live streamers in the world tells millions and millions and millions and millions of the kinds of people who are fans of one of the biggest streamers in the world that he's gonna give away PS5s in Union Square.

86
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,788
Rym: What do you think happened?

87
00:05:13,091 --> 00:05:13,900
Rym: A fucking riot.

88
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:22,260
Rym: Now, I was not at home when this happened, and I saw the news, and the news was like, "Live streamer caused this riot in Union

89
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:22,460
Rym: Square.".

90
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:26,299
Rym: And all I could think was, "There's no way it's as bad as the news is acting like it

91
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:26,440
Rym: is.".

92
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,559
Rym: And then I get home and I look at the news, and it was so much worse than I thought it was.

93
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:37,680
Scott: I mean, it was, you know, it wasn't good, but it wasn't like a riot with, like, looting, smashing all the windows, setting all the buildings on fire.

94
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:44,620
Rym: It was a riot of cars being smashed and vandalized and people throwing rebar at each other.

95
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:52,259
Scott: On a scale of, like, you know, zero being peaceful protest walk, you know, and ten being...

96
00:05:52,761 --> 00:05:57,400
Rym: January 6th at the White House trying to literally overthrow the government directly and actively.

97
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,960
Scott: I think ten would have to be actually overthrowing a government.

98
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:00,441
Scott: True.

99
00:06:00,521 --> 00:06:00,802
Rym: Nine!

100
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:01,545
Scott: Nine!

101
00:06:02,168 --> 00:06:05,160
Rym: January 6th was a nine because the ten would have been if they actually hung Mike Pence.

102
00:06:05,341 --> 00:06:09,274
Scott: Ten has to be, like, terrorism, murders, bombs, right?

103
00:06:09,315 --> 00:06:10,599
Scott: Like, full, you know, hell, right?

104
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,679
Rym: Well, I would say this only hit a four or, like, a four-ish because...

105
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,637
Scott: On that scale, this was like a three, four, five area.

106
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:25,180
Rym: Well, because New York City... Now, again, I am not saying that everything about this process is good.

107
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,342
Rym: Far from it.

108
00:06:26,643 --> 00:06:32,560
Rym: But to borrow a phrase that's getting a lot of mileage in my life from a YouTube video about why pet monkeys are banned in Sweden.

109
00:06:33,283 --> 00:06:34,668
Rym: I'm not saying this is good.

110
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:37,640
Rym: I'm just saying this is how it is or this is what happened.

111
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:48,800
Rym: So, New York City already has a rapid response force that is not just police but is also crowd control and, like, paramedics and firetruck and IMT.

112
00:06:49,020 --> 00:07:00,120
Rym: There is a whole rapid response force in New York whose sole job is to detect if a crowd has formed somewhere that is too big and make sure people don't get crushed to death by it.

113
00:07:00,761 --> 00:07:03,267
Rym: Like, this isn't even just designed for riots.

114
00:07:03,287 --> 00:07:09,120
Rym: They have a whole other, like, above and beyond process for there's a riot and we need to tear gas people.

115
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:10,997
Rym: This is like...

116
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,609
Scott: Yeah, those tear gas people did not show up to this.

117
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:16,580
Scott: That shows you the level of the riot was not at a level...

118
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,084
Rym: So, I did see video.

119
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:22,880
Rym: Tear gas was deployed but not the, like, artillery tear gas that we're all thinking of.

120
00:07:23,522 --> 00:07:26,880
Scott: You didn't see any pictures of, like, a whole phalanx of people with plastic shields.

121
00:07:27,242 --> 00:07:28,047
Rym: You did, actually.

122
00:07:28,067 --> 00:07:30,060
Rym: I'm gonna link to a two-hour livestream.

123
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,220
Scott: I didn't see that one.

124
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,928
Rym: The police actually did have to forcibly remove this crowd.

125
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:42,320
Rym: because this crowd, to be clear, nobody involved in this crowd thought they were getting a PlayStation.

126
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:49,380
Rym: They showed up with fireworks and they robbed a construction site with Rebar and they just started fighting with people and they refused to leave.

127
00:07:49,941 --> 00:08:00,880
Rym: But the reason New York has this is because crowds on this scale have appeared in New York for such things as some store is giving away free food or nothing.

128
00:08:03,781 --> 00:08:12,860
Scott: It's a thing that when you have a lot of people in a small place relative to the number of people, at least, and this can happen.

129
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:16,900
Scott: It's not gonna happen in your small town because there's not enough people there.

130
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:22,496
Rym: If literally every human within 50 miles of that town shows up, that's less people than ride the 6 train.

131
00:08:25,323 --> 00:08:26,400
Scott: Yeah, it's not dangerous.

132
00:08:27,061 --> 00:08:32,940
Rym: But remember in Halloween last year, that horrific tragedy where all those people died in South Korea during Halloween?

133
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:39,559
Rym: Crowds of humans that are uncontrolled in a small space are like natural disasters.

134
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,405
Rym: They are so dangerous.

135
00:08:41,726 --> 00:08:47,020
Rym: They are deadly and they are not obviously dangerous to people who don't know these facts.

136
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,560
Rym: So that's why New York has this response team.

137
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,517
Scott: Thankfully they are mostly only dangerous to the people participating and the only innocent bystanders.

138
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,059
Scott: But if you're far enough away, can't hurt you.

139
00:09:00,061 --> 00:09:01,860
Rym: So this was an absolute shit show.

140
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,811
Scott: And far enough away isn't really that far away.

141
00:09:03,851 --> 00:09:05,440
Scott: You could be like a block away and be fine.

142
00:09:06,562 --> 00:09:10,320
Rym: So, uh, New York City does not fuck around.

143
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,100
Rym: Within 4 hours they had shut this shit down.

144
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:19,360
Rym: They arrested like 70 people because a lot of these kids refused to leave even when ordered to.

145
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,920
Rym: The live streamer fucking bailed.

146
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,838
Rym: He gave one last treatment on social media that was like, "Yo dawg, it's a riot out there.

147
00:09:27,878 --> 00:09:28,440
Rym: You're all on your

148
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:28,560
Rym: own.".

149
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,420
Rym: And he tried to escape.

150
00:09:30,161 --> 00:09:30,804
Rym: There's video.

151
00:09:31,085 --> 00:09:34,500
Rym: His fans found his car, surrounded it, and like jumped on top of it.

152
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,060
Rym: And were like hanging to it as he tried to drive away.

153
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,579
Scott: Yeah, I think the thing is, because of the riotous nature, right?

154
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,420
Scott: All of the curiosities, like all the questions you have, really don't get answered.

155
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,074
Scott: Like, did he actually have the PS5s?

156
00:09:47,195 --> 00:09:48,000
Scott: What was his plan?

157
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,420
Rym: I mean the car he was in was not big enough to have that many PS5s in it.

158
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:51,802
Scott: Exactly.

159
00:09:52,063 --> 00:09:55,319
Scott: The people who came, did they actually think they were gonna get a PS5?

160
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,387
Scott: What were they mad about?

161
00:09:56,407 --> 00:09:57,696
Scott: Were they mad that the PS5s didn't happen?

162
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:03,800
Rym: So it seems like they weren't mad based on digging around and watching some of the live streams.

163
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:10,140
Rym: The people there seemed like they mostly showed up because they knew a bunch of people were gonna show up and some shit was gonna go down.

164
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,319
Rym: And they all were trying to live stream it themselves.

165
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:22,960
Rym: But we're gonna find out the details of how it went down because he was arrested and charged with inciting a riot, among other charges, by New York City.

166
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,980
Rym: And I think that was rightly done.

167
00:10:25,624 --> 00:10:26,440
Scott: That's gonna happen.

168
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:26,901
Scott: Yup.

169
00:10:27,443 --> 00:10:33,660
Rym: So this is a hell of a story and we're gonna find out a lot about exactly what happened.

170
00:10:34,481 --> 00:10:39,780
Scott: And within the next morning, I was biking past their summer streets and farmer's market, right?

171
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:54,778
Scott: So it's like, you know, while this story is entirely a true story, I want to still counter the narrative that a lot of people who don't live here think that New York City is somehow some violent, dangerous place.

172
00:10:56,421 --> 00:11:00,240
Rym: If you were one block away from this, you wouldn't even know what was happening.

173
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,820
Scott: You would be sitting at like a table outside a cafe, sipping a coffee, reading a book, right?

174
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,581
Scott: Yup.

175
00:11:06,601 --> 00:11:16,900
Rym: Like if you went to Union Square four hours after it happened, other than the destroyed construction site, which was unfortunate, there was no evidence that there was even a riot.

176
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,240
Scott: The construction site has insurance, that'll be fine.

177
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,720
Rym: Oh yeah, but it was like fucking destroyed.

178
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,840
Scott: The real estate person who owns the building, they're rich, they'll be fine.

179
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,100
Rym: Yup.

180
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:42,680
Rym: So speaking of absolute shit shows of crowds, Gen Con, the convention we don't attend for a laundry list of reasons, had its own gigantic, dangerous crowd because of Disney's Lorkana.

181
00:11:43,443 --> 00:11:48,340
Scott: So we've talked about Gen Con in the past, but it's basically, it's like, does Gen Con have positive aspects?

182
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:56,900
Scott: It's like, it's still, even though Pax Unplugged exists, it's the tabletop con for the industry, for releasing new games, for, you know, at least in the US, right?

183
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:04,020
Scott: You know, it brings together the RPGs and the card games and the board games and all the tabletop everything, right?

184
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:08,640
Scott: There's a lot of stuff there, but it's run poorly.

185
00:12:09,122 --> 00:12:09,209
Scott: Yeah.

186
00:12:09,861 --> 00:12:10,642
Scott: Very poorly.

187
00:12:10,783 --> 00:12:20,399
Scott: And one of the ways that it was run poorly is that there's basically no line management or policy or consideration given whatsoever.

188
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,900
Scott: It's basically just like, yeah, have at it, whatever.

189
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:32,520
Rym: Like imagine a line at Pax, if you've been to a Pax with the enforcers and like the pods and all that, imagine the literal, intentional opposite of that.

190
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:38,720
Rym: Imagine if Pax was like, everybody, fuck you, defend for yourselves, expo hall opens at 10, it's over there, go nuts.

191
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:39,821
Scott: Yep.

192
00:12:40,121 --> 00:12:41,182
Scott: That's what Gen Con does.

193
00:12:41,262 --> 00:12:55,480
Scott: So what happened is that Ravensburger has this new game, the Disney CCG Lorkana, which looks like it's at least going to be short term successful because there's already like, you know, demand for rare cards and all that kind of bullshit happening.

194
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,700
Scott: The game's barely or not even out yet.

195
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:04,832
Rym: Well, remember this is the game that Upper Deck is suing Ravensburger saying that Ravensburger stole this game idea from them.

196
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:10,920
Scott: Yep.

197
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:18,519
Scott: But anyway, but I think what we're going to end up doing is just buying like a one starter enough for two people to play and just to review the game.

198
00:13:18,599 --> 00:13:19,000
Scott: and that's it.

199
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:22,095
Scott: But anyway, so this game is obviously hot, right?

200
00:13:22,155 --> 00:13:23,019
Scott: People really want it.

201
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,885
Scott: And they had it at Gen Con because it's Gen Con.

202
00:13:26,246 --> 00:13:27,508
Scott: And so people really wanted it.

203
00:13:27,548 --> 00:13:28,469
Scott: And they're like, okay, fine.

204
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:31,755
Scott: You can line up starting at, you know, 3

205
00:13:31,755 --> 00:13:32,036
Scott: a.m.,

206
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:32,657
Scott: right?

207
00:13:33,398 --> 00:13:34,440
Scott: First come, first serve.

208
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,408
Scott: You know, if you leave line, you know, no cuts, no whatever.

209
00:13:38,448 --> 00:13:39,651
Scott: But who was actually enforcing?

210
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:43,580
Scott: Someone, I guess, stated those rules, but I don't know who was enforcing them.

211
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:49,820
Rym: So from what I've read, random people in the crowd attempted to enforce these rules themselves on the crowd.

212
00:13:50,722 --> 00:13:51,022
Scott: Yeah.

213
00:13:51,523 --> 00:13:58,819
Scott: And then basically, as soon as the con opened, you get a, you know, Black Friday, you know, discount at the mall situation.

214
00:13:59,240 --> 00:13:59,460
Scott: Right.

215
00:14:00,701 --> 00:14:04,087
Scott: You know, which hurt basically other attendees who didn't care about this.

216
00:14:04,508 --> 00:14:04,808
Scott: Right.

217
00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:11,300
Scott: The vendors, vendors who had booths that happened to be nearby the Lorkana booth were extremely negatively impacted.

218
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:15,929
Rym: Even worse, this made up line that the fans made.

219
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:21,900
Rym: when the con opened the next day, Gen Con staff ignored it, broke it up, and like opened a different entrance.

220
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,121
Scott: Yeah.

221
00:14:23,603 --> 00:14:23,945
Scott: I don't know.

222
00:14:23,965 --> 00:14:25,210
Scott: I've heard all kinds of things.

223
00:14:25,251 --> 00:14:27,240
Scott: I'm reading from the Polygon article right now.

224
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:29,603
Scott: I wasn't there, so I didn't even know.

225
00:14:29,644 --> 00:14:32,629
Scott: But the point is, people rushed the booth to buy this thing.

226
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:38,020
Scott: The booth, I guess, itself didn't, like I haven't heard anything from them, whether they cared or not.

227
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,283
Scott: Like they sold their copies.

228
00:14:39,343 --> 00:14:46,080
Scott: I also heard, I don't know if this is true or not, that even after the rush was done, they still had plenty left over, like they had made enough.

229
00:14:47,682 --> 00:14:49,576
Scott: So there didn't even need to be a rush.

230
00:14:49,858 --> 00:14:50,100
Scott: I guess.

231
00:14:50,240 --> 00:15:00,717
Rym: I mean, we don't need to belabor the point around how all the people who are destroying themselves and engaging in this behavior should probably think about their priorities.

232
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,220
Rym: And there's a lot going on here.

233
00:15:02,621 --> 00:15:09,375
Scott: Well, you know, I've also blamed the corporations for creating this sort of, you know, limited edition product Fuhrer, right?

234
00:15:10,056 --> 00:15:11,519
Scott: They should be held responsible for that.

235
00:15:12,421 --> 00:15:13,803
Scott: And I also blame the convention.

236
00:15:14,203 --> 00:15:24,320
Scott: It's like in this day and age where even people who can't afford a smartphone have a crappy phone that can receive texts or even if no one has a phone, right?

237
00:15:24,721 --> 00:15:30,440
Scott: It's like I can go to the grocery store and to get deli meats, they have a ticket system with like numbers.

238
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,709
Rym: And that shit worked when I was a kid in the eighties.

239
00:15:32,729 --> 00:15:35,180
Rym: You know what now also worked in the eighteen eighties.

240
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,140
Scott: Right.

241
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:46,640
Scott: So it's like there is no excuse to have people physically line up and wait for anything in this world, at least on the part of the world that has technology.

242
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:54,400
Rym: Unless you are evil, you are beholden to capitalism and the existence of the line and the Fuhrer and the nonsense is part of your marketing.

243
00:15:55,343 --> 00:15:55,565
Scott: Right.

244
00:15:55,585 --> 00:15:57,180
Scott: Like you want you want that to happen.

245
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,606
Rym: Like think about it like this still happens.

246
00:15:58,626 --> 00:16:02,120
Scott: You should be held responsible because you're hurting people for your own profit.

247
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:11,820
Rym: But I do also blame the people for falling for this shit every time they want these people in line thinks they're going to buy one of these things and flip it for money later.

248
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,979
Rym: The same scam in every industry all around this IP.

249
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:25,720
Scott: If also I'm waiting for the day, I don't know why this hasn't happened yet, at least in the United States, for a person with a disability to sue because that might happen.

250
00:16:26,242 --> 00:16:30,640
Rym: So there's a. there's a story here about someone's wheelchair being pushed over in the right.

251
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:37,860
Scott: But not not that for that reason, but for the reason of like I have a disability, I want I should have equal access to the thing.

252
00:16:38,241 --> 00:16:43,380
Scott: But I am not physically capable of sitting and waiting in a line in one place for that many hours.

253
00:16:44,241 --> 00:16:45,163
Scott: You should not be.

254
00:16:45,384 --> 00:16:46,467
Scott: the ADA in.

255
00:16:46,527 --> 00:16:51,460
Scott: my non lawyer argument basically makes lines of that nature illegal.

256
00:16:51,921 --> 00:17:02,400
Rym: So quoting the article, during all of this, at one point, quote, Ravensburger announced accommodations for those with disabilities, end quote.

257
00:17:02,941 --> 00:17:06,619
Rym: So someone made an appropriate complaint, I suspect.

258
00:17:08,601 --> 00:17:14,480
Scott: But the thing is, yeah, but it's like you made an accommodation, which means you recognize that everyone else isn't accommodated.

259
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,419
Scott: Why don't you just fucking do a digital cue of some kind?

260
00:17:17,641 --> 00:17:19,154
Rym: But also a lottery or anything.

261
00:17:19,174 --> 00:17:19,940
Rym: I blame Gen Con.

262
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:26,920
Scott: Or why don't you count how many people are in line, count what your supply is, and then just tell the people, listen, we counted a thousand people in line.

263
00:17:27,161 --> 00:17:28,348
Scott: We got twenty thousand.

264
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:29,095
Scott: You're good.

265
00:17:29,135 --> 00:17:29,780
Scott: You don't have to wait.

266
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:42,920
Rym: And this is why ultimately, while the Ravensburger owns this problem, Gen Con is equally at fault because at PAX, PAX requires companies who are doing shit like this to run it by them and coordinate it with them.

267
00:17:43,161 --> 00:17:45,147
Rym: PAX doesn't let you pull this kind of shit.

268
00:17:45,448 --> 00:17:48,960
Rym: If Ravensburger did this out of PAX, I think they would have been kicked out.

269
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:58,000
Scott: But I'm saying the law of the world, the country or the state or wherever you are, the laws should punish people for doing this.

270
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:06,580
Scott: If you have any sort of limited good that you are going to distribute, you should be legally required to distribute it in a safe and equitable manner.

271
00:18:07,202 --> 00:18:09,368
Scott: No waiting in line overnight.

272
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:10,572
Scott: First come, first serve.

273
00:18:10,612 --> 00:18:11,435
Scott: This isn't 1970 Star Wars tickets.

274
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,604
Scott: It's like we have technology now.

275
00:18:16,286 --> 00:18:16,827
Scott: Mandate.

276
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:17,949
Scott: It must be used.

277
00:18:17,989 --> 00:18:23,000
Scott: You cannot do these unsafe lines anymore, anywhere, for any reason, for anything.

278
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,422
Rym: I agree.

279
00:18:25,044 --> 00:18:32,080
Scott: Even if you want to do first come, you can still choose first come, first serve as your system for distribution.

280
00:18:32,421 --> 00:18:37,009
Scott: That's what you've decided on instead of a lottery, but you can't make people physically wait.

281
00:18:37,069 --> 00:18:43,280
Scott: There has to be some other, like at the deli counter or click on something at the right moment or something like that.

282
00:18:44,121 --> 00:18:55,760
Rym: But beyond the law, because we know how America is and how we can't pass laws right now, I would also say this is a profound indictment of every aspect of Gen Con sucks because of this kind of thing.

283
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:03,515
Rym: This is like, this is the epitome of the culture of the people who run Gen Con that they allow this kind of situation to even exist.

284
00:19:03,835 --> 00:19:06,200
Rym: And this is exactly how Gen Con has always been.

285
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:06,600
Scott: Right.

286
00:19:06,881 --> 00:19:21,800
Scott: But the point I guess I'm trying to make is that even though the current laws of Indianapolis in the United States don't make these behaviors illegal necessarily, right, is that I view these actions as, you know, bankrupt as I view criminal actions.

287
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,460
Rym: I see Ravensburger and Gen Con equally bankrupt in this regard.

288
00:19:26,401 --> 00:19:31,020
Scott: Yes, what they are doing I view as criminal activity, right, harming people.

289
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:43,937
Rym: So speaking of shit shows at Gen Con, also, some guys, and I'll link to it because there's just photos of them, like it's a convention center.

290
00:19:44,037 --> 00:19:47,393
Scott: I don't know what these nerds- I've thought about doing this in the past.

291
00:19:47,454 --> 00:19:47,980
Scott: I won't lie.

292
00:19:48,241 --> 00:19:56,880
Rym: Yeah, but the one thing I know, because you and I have been behind the scenes of many conventions, convention centers have cameras everywhere.

293
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:03,220
Scott: There is not one inch of a convention, of a major US convention center that is not on cameras.

294
00:20:05,144 --> 00:20:06,940
Scott: The bathroom is about where you can hide.

295
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:17,260
Rym: And the perpetrators of this incident, like I'm looking at photos of them right now, they are distinctive enough to where I am confident they are all going to be caught and someone's going to stitch on them.

296
00:20:17,781 --> 00:20:30,280
Scott: These dudes just walked in to where the pallets with like stuff for the expo- Right, the convention people are loading the convention, right, and when a convention loads, there's trucks and vans coming to the loading dock.

297
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:43,060
Scott: The union people, I don't know if Indianapolis is union, but the employees take stuff, unload the vehicles, and put them on the big giant empty show floor, and they just dump the pallets in the right spot.

298
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:52,540
Scott: And then you're an exhibitor, you come to where your booth is, and there's all these pallets with all your stuff on them, and then you have to build, you have to tear them down yourself and build your booth.

299
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:58,680
Scott: Maybe you also have to have some union help depending on what you're doing, right, to hang things from the ceiling or the rigging, who knows, right?

300
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:08,800
Scott: But the point is, until you've unloaded your pallets, right, it's basically anyone who has access to the show floor has access to all the stuff on the show floor.

301
00:21:09,181 --> 00:21:15,460
Scott: And who knows who goes with what stuff, it's just a madhouse of, you know, staff and everywhere, right?

302
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:27,460
Rym: And it's chaotic, like, we've been behind the scenes of a PAX expo hall or another convention's expo hall, or even setting up ConnectiCon back when we ran that whole floor, like, it's chaos, and there's a lot going on.

303
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:36,860
Rym: But these dudes just grabbed a pallet with around $300,000 worth of some sort of collectible card game boxes.

304
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:45,553
Scott: I'm gonna guess it was from, like, a card vendor who had a booth, and they had all their inventory and a pallet, and then, you

305
00:21:45,753 --> 00:21:46,033
Rym: know,

306
00:21:46,594 --> 00:21:50,480
Scott: they just used a pallet jack and they didn't even have a forklift, they just used a pallet jack and they wheeled it away.

307
00:21:50,720 --> 00:22:16,780
Rym: Yep, and there are copious photos of these dudes wheeling it away, like, they just wheeled it out, like, they're even in the carpeted part of the convention center, which is also amazing because, at least, never been to GenCon, but every other convention I've been to, you can't bring pallets into the carpeted areas, like, you have to use the loading docks, and if I tried to bring a pallet, like, in ConnectiCon, if I rolled a pallet and it even touched a centimeter of the public carpeted space...

308
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,774
Scott: The convention center staff would be like, "What the hell is this doing here?

309
00:22:19,814 --> 00:22:20,397
Scott: What are you

310
00:22:20,437 --> 00:22:20,679
Scott: doing?".

311
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,304
Rym: So, again, GenCon, what the fuck?

312
00:22:23,525 --> 00:22:30,016
Rym: How, it's one thing, if they did it entirely within the show floor, how did these dudes even get into this space?

313
00:22:30,076 --> 00:22:32,040
Rym: They don't look like they were vendors, they look like they're just attendees.

314
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:39,352
Scott: Yeah, I mean, my strategy, like, if I, first of all, like, it's like, Wall-A takes some guts to steal a whole pallet going for the big haul, right?

315
00:22:39,492 --> 00:22:44,300
Scott: It's like, it's so big, it's so difficult to get away with that, it's so big and conspicuous, right?

316
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:48,088
Rym: It's not worth the squeeze, even if you get away with it 100%.

317
00:22:48,088 --> 00:22:49,531
Rym: What the fuck are you gonna do with these?

318
00:22:49,611 --> 00:22:53,940
Rym: Fencing them is gonna cost you so much in terms of time and effort that you're not gonna...

319
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:18,369
Scott: The real strategy would be, you have some plastic storage tubs in your own booth, and you go to other booths where there's no one there, and you take, like, one box of Magic cards that are sealed, and you hide it in your own booth storage, and no one knows, you know, it's like, if they don't notice it's missing, amongst their hundred boxes of Magic cards, they're not counting their inventory until the end of the show or the end of the day or whatever, right?

320
00:23:18,629 --> 00:23:21,214
Scott: And they'll be like, "Ah, shit, we lost a box," right?

321
00:23:21,535 --> 00:23:23,559
Scott: It's like, are they really gonna, you know, it's like...

322
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:34,399
Rym: Well, this, actually, the reason I wanted to bring up this story, even though we already had a lot of news to talk about, is that all of the stories we talked about today have a theme.

323
00:23:35,841 --> 00:23:36,993
Scott: Yeah, you notice this theme.

324
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:43,519
Rym: Now, the broader theme, if I zoom out all the way, is capitalism is a fucking problem, but if we zoom in a little bit...

325
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,161
Scott: Just think about it.

326
00:23:44,221 --> 00:23:46,829
Scott: These cards were just worth their cardboard.

327
00:23:46,849 --> 00:23:48,152
Scott: They're not actually worth anything.

328
00:23:48,172 --> 00:23:50,659
Scott: It's because of the evil collectible bullshit.

329
00:23:51,601 --> 00:23:54,012
Rym: There is zero scarcity on these things.

330
00:23:54,052 --> 00:23:55,820
Rym: There isn't even scarcity on PlayStations.

331
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,865
Scott: It's like he stole $300,000 worth of cards.

332
00:23:57,945 --> 00:24:00,592
Scott: It's like, no, he stole, like, $1,000 of cardboard.

333
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:03,199
Scott: It's, like, that people prescribe more value to.

334
00:24:03,259 --> 00:24:05,222
Scott: If they just... They could just decide to print.

335
00:24:05,884 --> 00:24:16,020
Scott: Nothing is actually physically... I mean, I think people said there was some kind of agreement or something, but, like, nothing legally that I'm aware of will stop Wizards of the Coast.

336
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,347
Scott: They could print a million black lotuses if they wanted to.

337
00:24:19,808 --> 00:24:25,160
Scott: And they could print them in such a way that they would be indistinguishable from the old beta ones, right?

338
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,788
Scott: They could use the same ink and the same paper, right?

339
00:24:27,968 --> 00:24:30,596
Scott: And they could get them out into the market and no one would know.

340
00:24:30,957 --> 00:24:32,140
Scott: Nothing's stopping them from doing that.

341
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:37,820
Scott: This artificial value scarcity nonsense is hurting real people, right?

342
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,531
Rym: And the two mentalities, because the problem is, this is a feedback loop.

343
00:24:41,591 --> 00:24:44,400
Rym: On one hand, I blame the companies because they are...

344
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:44,819
Scott: The most.

345
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:56,760
Rym: Because even in capitalism, companies could act a lot more ethically and still be fine, but they choose extreme profits over literally everything else on Earth.

346
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,740
Scott: I think that in some of these cases, they're choosing lower profits.

347
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,920
Rym: Well, I mean, I do too, but I think that's an adjacent conversation.

348
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,620
Scott: Yes, we've talked about that before.

349
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:20,060
Rym: I think the companies could do things to make a lot more money and at the same time also be more ethical and make a very different ecosystem in gaming, but that's a bigger topic that deserves maybe a future show or panel or something.

350
00:25:20,701 --> 00:25:36,180
Rym: But it's a feedback loop too because the fans, the people, are also causing this and I think it's the live streamer mentality feedback loop intersecting, which is a fame economy, intersecting with the collector mentality.

351
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,139
Scott: The hustler.

352
00:25:38,102 --> 00:25:40,348
Scott: All these people have in common is that they're hustling, right?

353
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:44,640
Scott: They're not playing games purely for the joy of playing games.

354
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,226
Rym: Nobody in that line wanted a PlayStation.

355
00:25:47,446 --> 00:25:49,932
Rym: Nobody in that line wanted Larkana to play it.

356
00:25:50,192 --> 00:25:53,460
Rym: They're all hustling either to live stream it or fence it.

357
00:25:54,821 --> 00:26:04,280
Scott: Yeah, even if they did want to play it or even if they did, it's like there is also the hustler mixed in with that.

358
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:11,194
Scott: There is the purity of simply wanting to enjoy the entertainment was not there.

359
00:26:11,294 --> 00:26:13,760
Scott: It was mixed in with attempting to profit.

360
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:23,700
Rym: And in a way, capitalism on all angles, in a way, I respect the dudes who just fucking stole the cards more than the people who stood in that Larkana line because they were dumb.

361
00:26:24,161 --> 00:26:26,511
Scott: They were dumb, but I respect that because they're not there.

362
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:28,740
Rym: They are not lying or pretending.

363
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,352
Rym: They were like, I'm fucking stealing magic cards to sell for money.

364
00:26:31,372 --> 00:26:32,860
Rym: I'll steal whatever or whatever.

365
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:33,888
Scott: Who knows what they might have been?

366
00:26:33,908 --> 00:26:35,039
Scott: Pokemon cards are a mix.

367
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:38,489
Rym: I am stealing these because people think they're valuable.

368
00:26:38,509 --> 00:26:42,100
Rym: I'm not going to even pretend to engage with the game itself.

369
00:26:42,381 --> 00:26:49,720
Rym: Now, the pro move would be if the people who stole them stole them because they have 100 friends and they're just going to play magic or whatever.

370
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,770
Scott: I think someone said they were magic commander decks.

371
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:55,300
Scott: It's like they're just going to play commander from now until the end of time.

372
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:59,417
Rym: If that's true, that edges into anti-capitalist action.

373
00:26:59,437 --> 00:27:00,100
Rym: I think it's funny.

374
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,342
Scott: That's awesome.

375
00:27:02,104 --> 00:27:04,372
Scott: They just really wanted to play commander, but they couldn't afford it.

376
00:27:04,392 --> 00:27:06,880
Scott: And now they can play commander till they're blue in the face.

377
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:13,135
Rym: So anyway, in the meta moment, we will be at PAX West.

378
00:27:13,176 --> 00:27:13,838
Rym: Look for us.

379
00:27:13,998 --> 00:27:14,460
Scott: We'll hang out.

380
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:14,962
Scott: Hopefully.

381
00:27:15,022 --> 00:27:15,344
Scott: I know.

382
00:27:15,585 --> 00:27:18,520
Scott: I'm going to guarantee you there won't be any dangerous lines.

383
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:22,055
Scott: There might be long lines, but you don't need to wait in any of them.

384
00:27:22,075 --> 00:27:23,100
Scott: They'll be well managed.

385
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:28,240
Rym: So PAX, to talk about why PAX is the literal inverse of Gen Con and every point that matters.

386
00:27:28,681 --> 00:27:31,360
Rym: We're panelists, so we're guests of the con.

387
00:27:31,881 --> 00:27:40,499
Rym: One of the things they ask us every year is, "Hey, do you want to do a fan meetup of any kind or any sort of gathering of any

388
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:40,780
Rym: kind?".

389
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,905
Rym: Because if you do, one, we want to help.

390
00:27:43,627 --> 00:27:49,000
Rym: And two, you have to fucking tell us because if you do it without asking, it's going to be trouble.

391
00:27:49,281 --> 00:27:51,180
Rym: We don't want a Gen Con situation, basically.

392
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,500
Rym: So maybe we'll do a little GeekNights speed up for anyone who wants to see us.

393
00:27:56,763 --> 00:27:58,340
Scott: All but one person will come.

394
00:27:59,881 --> 00:28:00,523
Rym: So we'll see.

395
00:28:00,864 --> 00:28:03,012
Rym: Also, we've got four days in Seattle.

396
00:28:03,112 --> 00:28:05,300
Rym: I'm sure we'll find some time to hang out with some people.

397
00:28:06,441 --> 00:28:07,247
Rym: Look for our panel.

398
00:28:07,287 --> 00:28:08,073
Rym: We'll post the schedule.

399
00:28:08,093 --> 00:28:08,920
Rym: We'll post all that stuff.

400
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,884
Rym: We're back at PAX's, baby.

401
00:28:12,345 --> 00:28:12,987
Rym: I'm excited.

402
00:28:13,007 --> 00:28:14,351
Rym: We've got an all new panel.

403
00:28:14,491 --> 00:28:15,734
Rym: I started sketching stuff out.

404
00:28:15,754 --> 00:28:17,760
Rym: I've got a good, clever angle here.

405
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,160
Rym: But the problem is, we submitted this panel.

406
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,460
Scott: Did you just skip from over things of the day and went to meta moment?

407
00:28:24,162 --> 00:28:25,410
Rym: Oh yeah, I went straight to meta moment.

408
00:28:25,612 --> 00:28:26,699
Rym: I got too excited about this.

409
00:28:27,961 --> 00:28:31,059
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

410
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:33,802
Rym: So my thing of the day.

411
00:28:33,943 --> 00:28:41,520
Rym: You ever see a war movie and there's people on a navy ship and there's like one guy who has a gigantic helmet?

412
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:47,240
Rym: Like everyone else has normal helmets and there's one guy with like this gigantic helmet, usually in the background.

413
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:52,060
Rym: And like, you wonder if it's a thing, but it's like not acknowledged and no one says anything about it.

414
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,549
Rym: Like it's not part of the plot.

415
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:59,340
Rym: It almost looks like one guy is wearing a prop that just doesn't fit.

416
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:04,820
Rym: Well this video, in three minutes, will explain what the deal is with those big helmets.

417
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:10,160
Rym: And they're actually very clever, very important, and very cool, and they're a real thing.

418
00:29:11,042 --> 00:29:11,325
Scott: Okay.

419
00:29:11,345 --> 00:29:12,699
Rym: So what do you got?

420
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:18,100
Scott: So speaking of games and hustling, we all know that crane games are just slot machines.

421
00:29:18,461 --> 00:29:18,661
Scott: Right?

422
00:29:19,022 --> 00:29:27,906
Scott: You can, when you have a crane game, if you open the back of a standard crane machine, you configure, you tell the crane machine, "My merchandise is worth this much money.

423
00:29:27,926 --> 00:29:30,252
Scott: This is how much money per play.

424
00:29:30,272 --> 00:29:32,899
Scott: I want you to make this much profit

425
00:29:32,939 --> 00:29:33,260
Scott: margin.".

426
00:29:33,621 --> 00:29:38,352
Scott: And the claw will only grab with full strength and with a frequency.

427
00:29:38,372 --> 00:29:41,800
Scott: that is, you know, gonna get you the profit margins you desire.

428
00:29:42,042 --> 00:29:42,283
Scott: Right?

429
00:29:42,565 --> 00:29:44,879
Scott: You could configure it to pay out every time.

430
00:29:45,523 --> 00:29:49,120
Scott: In which case, you don't have a claw machine, you have a fun vending machine.

431
00:29:51,201 --> 00:29:53,106
Scott: But that's how claws work.

432
00:29:53,407 --> 00:29:58,380
Scott: Claw machines are gambling or anything similar to a claw machine is still gambling.

433
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,004
Scott: Don't play those.

434
00:30:00,386 --> 00:30:00,888
Scott: They're bad.

435
00:30:00,948 --> 00:30:03,580
Scott: However, in Japan, obviously they're a big deal.

436
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:04,282
Scott: Right?

437
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,320
Scott: UFO catchers and claws and whatever.

438
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:14,120
Scott: And there's a whole culture of people who go and play claw, you know, and associated games at game centers.

439
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:17,040
Scott: And most of those people are losing money gambling.

440
00:30:17,385 --> 00:30:17,460
Scott: Yep.

441
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:22,160
Scott: However, a claw machine does differ from a slot machine in one regard.

442
00:30:22,882 --> 00:30:26,280
Scott: And that is, it is still beholden to the laws of physics.

443
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:27,563
Scott: Ahhh.

444
00:30:28,641 --> 00:30:46,040
Scott: If you can somehow get the prize to fall down the hole by some means without opening it and stealing, right, crime, you win that prize, even though the slot, the crane machine may still be not closing its claw with full strength.

445
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:54,980
Scott: So it's like, can you get it to drop the prize when the claw is basically not, you know, closing fully, right?

446
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,900
Scott: And deciding to give you the prize.

447
00:30:57,381 --> 00:31:06,480
Scott: And in Japan, many, many claw machines apparently are poorly configured or the prize is inside or set up in an interesting way.

448
00:31:07,322 --> 00:31:26,820
Scott: And if you have a lot of skills and practice and 100 yen coins to spare, and you really want to get, I don't know, 30 anime figures, or a pile of plushies, right, there are ways that you can get and profit from claw machines with incredible levels of skill.

449
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,350
Scott: Do not play the claw machines.

450
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:29,680
Scott: You will not profit.

451
00:31:30,241 --> 00:31:39,260
Scott: But this YouTube channel, run by someone, a Japanese person named Yuya, I guess that's their internet name, is the claw master.

452
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:43,000
Scott: And I can't deny, they are really good at the crane game.

453
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:47,800
Scott: They know all the secrets of the crane game, various different kinds of crane games.

454
00:31:48,161 --> 00:31:52,580
Scott: They can spot ones that are poorly configured or weak or have vulnerabilities.

455
00:31:53,601 --> 00:31:58,920
Scott: In one video, they won three PS4s with a few dollars.

456
00:32:00,142 --> 00:32:12,399
Scott: In another video, they're swinging the claw around without making it descend, and there's a display in the back of the crane with a bunch of tiny plushies, and they spin the claw around, it grabs it and knocks it over, and all the plushies come falling down.

457
00:32:14,162 --> 00:32:17,656
Rym: Oh, that video appeared in my feed before you made this the thing of the day.

458
00:32:17,697 --> 00:32:18,440
Rym: I saw that video.

459
00:32:19,022 --> 00:32:24,740
Scott: Yeah, so this person, watch them, but do not try to replicate them because you will fail, right?

460
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,780
Scott: But enjoy that they are beating the system, right?

461
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:36,380
Scott: And they're like getting these, some of these anime figures are worth at least 20 bucks, and they're knocking some of them down into the hole with like three or four pokes.

462
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,324
Scott: That's a $15 profit, right?

463
00:32:38,344 --> 00:32:44,940
Scott: And this person, also I appreciate, they know that crane games are a slot machine, right?

464
00:32:45,342 --> 00:32:49,199
Scott: And they're straight up telling you like, "Hey, if I miss this, I'm gonna lose money," right?

465
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:55,520
Scott: And like, "I need to get this in so many pokes in order for it to pay out," et cetera, et cetera, right?

466
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:59,020
Scott: They're not, they're not, you know, they're telling the truth about the situation, right?

467
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:07,140
Scott: They're not deluding themselves into thinking that like they're skilled at, you know, I mean, they are skilled at the crane, but you know, they know the reality.

468
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:11,320
Rym: But yeah, they have the gnosis of the nature of the claw itself.

469
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:14,209
Scott: They're like, they're like, "The claw is not going to grab strongly.

470
00:33:14,329 --> 00:33:17,840
Scott: I need to do something different and unintended to get the prizes to come

471
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:17,980
Scott: out.".

472
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,760
Rym: There is some clever shit in here, like getting the claw to hook around a little loop in a plushie that you're not even supposed to be able to get out of there.

473
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:27,259
Scott: Yeah, whenever a plushie has a tag on it, they're like, "Oh, let's grab that

474
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:27,420
Scott: tag.".

475
00:33:28,221 --> 00:33:32,100
Scott: In one video, he even has a claw at home, and he's like, "Look at the structure of the claw.

476
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:40,056
Scott: Some of the people, the clerks at the, at the claw places don't put the tip of the claw on properly, and you can snag something on the back of the

477
00:33:40,117 --> 00:33:40,459
Scott: claw.".

478
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:41,275
Scott: And he's like, "See right

479
00:33:41,316 --> 00:33:41,500
Scott: here?".

480
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:46,180
Scott: He's like, you know, so this is, this is truly a fascinating situation.

481
00:33:46,621 --> 00:33:47,708
Scott: There's not that many videos.

482
00:33:47,728 --> 00:33:49,639
Scott: You can just watch the whole channel, pretty much.

483
00:33:51,305 --> 00:33:51,488
Scott: Alright.

484
00:33:51,509 --> 00:33:51,998
Scott: I enjoyed it.

485
00:33:52,320 --> 00:34:05,000
Rym: So, to continue the second half of my over-enthusiastic meta moment, got too excited about PAX, because it's, you know, in the pre-COVID times, starting in August, it's the good summertime, but it's also the time when I start thinking, "Pax is coming.

486
00:34:05,662 --> 00:34:06,088
Rym: PAX is

487
00:34:06,108 --> 00:34:06,433
Rym: coming."

488
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:12,799
Rym: And I always get a little jazzed up about it, but we did the Book Club book, This is How You Lose the Time War, we read it, we did the show.

489
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:15,900
Rym: The next one will be some amount of the Murderbot Diaries.

490
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:30,199
Rym: We are planning to do the next Book Club show, I haven't made the post yet, probably toward the end of September, and our goal is we're gonna cover as much of the Murderbot Diaries as we've read by then, so just start reading.

491
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:34,514
Scott: Yeah, so, right, we didn't realize that it was another short one, and I was like, "But there's seven books,

492
00:34:34,636 --> 00:34:34,777
Scott: right?".

493
00:34:35,161 --> 00:34:37,619
Scott: So, I think what we're gonna do is we're gonna have a little fun.

494
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:45,360
Scott: It's like, how many of these little volumes can we read, you know, by, you know, we can't just say read 'em all, that's too much, right?

495
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:48,480
Scott: And we can't, you know, picking a number of them is also difficult.

496
00:34:48,562 --> 00:34:49,319
Scott: So let's have fun.

497
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:53,940
Scott: Let's say we'll do the episode in like a couple months-ish, right?

498
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,373
Scott: How many will we read by then, right?

499
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:01,040
Scott: You know, we might say, "Ah, these suck, I don't wanna read anymore," and stop, right?

500
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:06,160
Scott: We might get so excited and read all of them, even though I think that's too much, right?

501
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:11,899
Rym: A dark horse factor is the Rym factor of, "Well, I read one of the Wheel of Times, I guess I'm in it to the

502
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:12,120
Rym: end.".

503
00:35:13,181 --> 00:35:17,420
Scott: Yeah, but it's not, you might be in it to the end, but will you get to the end by the time we do the episode?

504
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,120
Rym: That is true.

505
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:25,000
Scott: So, the book club selection is some number, unknown, you can have fun guessing, right?

506
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:32,919
Scott: How many volumes, or predicting, how many volumes of the Murderbot Diaries we will get through, at least one, guaranteed, no matter what.

507
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:33,922
Rym: You know what this means?

508
00:35:34,364 --> 00:35:40,000
Rym: Every meta moment, we can interrogate each other about the status of bots and murders.

509
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:48,220
Scott: Yeah, you'll get every GeekNights episode, there'll be a status update about how many Murderbot Diaries you're gonna have to get through, and when the episode is gonna be.

510
00:35:48,981 --> 00:35:55,620
Scott: That way, we can sort of balance the "get a substantial amount of book" in there, because one volume is tiny.

511
00:35:56,664 --> 00:35:58,499
Scott: For the people watching, look how tiny this thing is.

512
00:35:59,608 --> 00:36:00,380
Scott: From the library.

513
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:03,059
Rym: And the Time War was also a pretty thin, that was like a three hour read.

514
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:05,709
Scott: This is Time War sized, right?

515
00:36:05,729 --> 00:36:08,339
Scott: So, you know, that's that.

516
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:17,280
Rym: Alright, so, I have played Pitchcar, I want to say seven or eight times in my life, at various points?

517
00:36:18,162 --> 00:36:23,580
Scott: Some single digit number of times, but for real, of various degrees, right?

518
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:27,300
Scott: Because sometimes you play a little Pitchcar, and sometimes you play a big Pitchcar.

519
00:36:28,721 --> 00:36:36,680
Rym: At a gathering relatively recently, thanks to our good friend Matt, we were able to play what I would call- Matt owns every single Pitchcar expansion.

520
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:43,120
Scott: I'd say we played a fully realized Pitchcar, like- Yeah, so I don't think it gets bigger or better than that.

521
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,400
Scott: Your wildest dreams.

522
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:49,620
Scott: You could buy multiple sets and make it even bigger, but it's like, what's the point then, right?

523
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,660
Scott: This was the ideal sized Pitchcar.

524
00:36:52,562 --> 00:37:02,700
Rym: So, Pitchcar is one of those relatively rare games, there's more now, but it kind of comes and goes in the tabletop gaming world.

525
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:10,740
Rym: Dexterity games come and go in terms of popularity, but a very specific subset of dexterity games are the flicking games.

526
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:15,640
Scott: I want to make a comment about flicking games in general, while we're here, because why not?

527
00:37:16,162 --> 00:37:20,595
Scott: And this happened, and I didn't comment on it at the time, because who really cares, right?

528
00:37:20,615 --> 00:37:22,040
Scott: It's not that serious a game.

529
00:37:22,421 --> 00:37:30,360
Scott: But whenever I play flicking games, even as far back as middle school times, a lot of people don't flick properly, as far as I'm concerned.

530
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:37,080
Rym: I had a note in my notes that I wanted to bring that up and another related topic up before we got into Pitchcar itself.

531
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:44,900
Scott: As far as I'm concerned, a valid flick means that you use your thumb and you pick one of your other four fingers.

532
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,300
Scott: It doesn't matter which one, I don't really care, right?

533
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,400
Rym: Middle finger's the best one, but we could disagree there.

534
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:58,140
Scott: You pick one of your other fingers and you press the nail of the finger against your thumb as hard as you want, right?

535
00:37:58,641 --> 00:38:02,760
Scott: But your finger doesn't actually move forward because your thumb is holding it back.

536
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:11,940
Scott: And then you release your thumb, and all that pressure that you are applying to your thumb with your finger is released in one instant.

537
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:23,600
Scott: And your finger that is released hits the object that you are flicking for a mere instant, and then it transfers power and momentum into it, and then that object then moves.

538
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,763
Scott: And that is a flick.

539
00:38:25,164 --> 00:38:29,375
Scott: I've seen people do shit like put their thumb on top of an object and try to release it.

540
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,684
Scott: That's not a valid flick, right?

541
00:38:33,065 --> 00:38:37,237
Scott: I've seen people just push it, like tap it with the back of their finger.

542
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:47,335
Scott: Yeah, none of those are valid flicks, and if I was holding a serious competition... No one's playing Pitchcar seriously, we weren't.

543
00:38:48,380 --> 00:39:04,669
Scott: But if I was having any serious competition at a flicking game, if someone did an invalid flick, as in not what I just described, and they were physically capable of doing a valid flick... I would just say, "Listen, that was your one warning.

544
00:39:05,029 --> 00:39:09,580
Scott: If you ever do a non-valid flick again in the tournament, you're just disqualified for the whole tournament.

545
00:39:09,961 --> 00:39:12,230
Scott: You must do a valid, true flick.

546
00:39:12,752 --> 00:39:13,917
Scott: Anything else is not a flick.

547
00:39:13,978 --> 00:39:14,339
Scott: Get out of

548
00:39:14,379 --> 00:39:14,500
Scott: here.".

549
00:39:15,262 --> 00:39:22,640
Rym: So the second point around that that's in my notes, I guess I'll get this out of the way first before we review Pitchcar as a flicking game.

550
00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:26,500
Rym: Because this also is not about Pitchcar, this is about all flicking games.

551
00:39:27,161 --> 00:39:38,900
Rym: I have found in my personal experience across all flicking games that the people who do not flick properly either do not want any instruction or assistance flicking.

552
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:46,840
Rym: Like, they will actively resist being given advice or help, and two, even if given advice and help, will never flick properly.

553
00:39:47,261 --> 00:39:49,417
Rym: Like, they just never change what they're doing no matter what.

554
00:39:51,141 --> 00:39:55,900
Rym: But what this leads to is my sort of final flicking game conundrum.

555
00:39:57,043 --> 00:40:00,380
Rym: And if you want to play Pitchcar or games like it with your friends, this is a warning.

556
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:20,024
Rym: Just like there are games where they can be played fast, but a certain kind of person will bog it down, Pitchcar and all flicking games, I have found, cause a significant percentage of the people who play them to get really, really frustrated, angry, heated, yelling, quitting the game,

557
00:40:20,204 --> 00:40:22,432
Scott: even in a non-serious who cares game,

558
00:40:22,993 --> 00:40:39,360
Rym: like even when everyone in the group is supportive, and everyone's laughing and having a good time and no one cares who wins, I see people, and the same thing happens in mini golf, I see people lose their fucking shit in these games and like have to walk away or start yelling or get actually angry.

559
00:40:39,721 --> 00:40:47,300
Rym: And I have seen this in every tabletop flicking game I have ever played, like without exception.

560
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,185
Rym: Not all dexterity games have this problem.

561
00:40:50,546 --> 00:40:59,619
Rym: Flicking games, if you have a friend who gets a little over frustrated if they're not doing well in a game, I advise you to not play flicking related games with them.

562
00:41:00,983 --> 00:41:03,180
Scott: Or, you know, sports in general.

563
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:23,040
Rym: But flicking games are a place where there's a lot of people who have that problem who might avoid sports, but don't quite internalize that a flicking game is also a sport, and thus they start playing it, they don't do well, and rather than just shrugging it off like they might in a regular tabletop game, they get like unreasonably angry.

564
00:41:24,541 --> 00:41:31,400
Scott: Okay, so Pitch Car is a flicking game where it's really straightforward, is you build a racetrack, like Hot Wheels, but only wider, right?

565
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:44,690
Scott: And you have discs, just wooden discs basically, and you take turns, you have a disc that's your car, and on your turn you flick it, and your goal is to get around the racetrack first, it's a race, right?

566
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:49,060
Scott: But everyone gets an equal number of flicks because you take turns in rotation, right?

567
00:41:49,461 --> 00:41:51,845
Scott: So, that's all there is to it, really.

568
00:41:51,865 --> 00:42:09,600
Scott: If you go off the track, however, which happens often, basically what happens is you have to put your disc back where it started, and then wait for, you know, your next turn, you basically just didn't progress that turn, which, that's the thing that bogs the game down.

569
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:17,479
Scott: However, you could say, "Well, why don't you just, you know, put the disc where it left the track, but the person then loses their next

570
00:42:17,559 --> 00:42:17,800
Scott: turn?".

571
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:30,306
Scott: And it's like, you could do that, but actually, that would encourage people to just hit the thing really hard and leave the track somewhere really far away, so that, that would actually give them more progress, right?

572
00:42:30,427 --> 00:42:36,880
Scott: Actually having to progress safely through all the parts of the track is what makes the game meaningful.

573
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:43,020
Scott: If you could just, otherwise it would just become, flick the hardest the game, and the track itself would lose all meaning and purpose.

574
00:42:43,221 --> 00:42:44,979
Scott: So that's why you can't have that rule adjustment.

575
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:54,900
Rym: Now the other little bit is that the car, the little cars have a car logo on the top and nothing on the bottom, because you also, your car needs to land face up.

576
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:56,542
Scott: Correct.

577
00:42:57,064 --> 00:43:01,100
Scott: Now you could, it could flip over, as long as it lands face up, you're all good.

578
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:30,800
Rym: Now one thing I did find, digging through some online chatter and the board game forum is that most people who, I feel like there are people who play Pitch Car once or twice at a convention, and people who are Pitch Car people, and I have found reliably, people who are into Pitch Car will do something that, I think it's a flaw in the game, that the game does not have the, like, extremely precise rules to handle all the potential edge cases of a flick and gone awry.

579
00:43:31,226 --> 00:43:31,573
Rym: I agree, yes.

580
00:43:31,716 --> 00:43:31,880
Rym: Correct.

581
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:52,320
Rym: But the way to deal with that, if you play Pitch Car, this is one of those games where you should, regardless of exactly what the rules say, define up front, out loud, with the group you're playing with, exactly how the game will proceed in detail, and pre-make the calls you expect to be able to have to make based on the track and the people.

582
00:43:53,121 --> 00:44:04,440
Rym: Even if those are not in the rules, this is the one case where I say, you need to do that up front, not only to avoid the weird frustration problem, but also to avoid the debate mid-game of whether or not a flick was okay.

583
00:44:05,654 --> 00:44:05,779
Scott: Yep.

584
00:44:06,741 --> 00:44:11,239
Rym: So, the components in this game are honestly pretty A+.

585
00:44:12,001 --> 00:44:18,360
Rym: They, you're gonna make a pretty good course, and it's pretty obvious what makes a good obstacle or not.

586
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:21,460
Rym: Like, I'm really impressed with the physicality of this game.

587
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:27,800
Rym: It's the kind of game if I had a house, I would definitely own, and because I have a New York apartment, I will definitely never own.

588
00:44:28,622 --> 00:44:47,800
Scott: The thing is, you know, you have to have, to build a good course, you either need to A) not have enough pieces that you can make something that won't work, in which case anyone can build the course, or B) if you have lots and lots of pieces for lots and lots of fun, you need adult considered restraint to not make an impossible course.

589
00:44:57,422 --> 00:44:57,756
Scott: Yep.

590
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:58,920
Scott: Right?

591
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:03,860
Scott: But, like, don't put, like, the jumps in front of the loop, it's impossible, right?

592
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,980
Scott: It's like there should just be a straightaway for the loop, right?

593
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:12,580
Scott: Because otherwise, no one's ever gonna be able to do the loop, and it'll just be a frustrating, you know, mess, and no one will win.

594
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:20,639
Scott: You know, it's like, you could build the bridge, it's like, make the area around the bridge kinda easy, 'cause actually getting over the bridge isn't as easy as it looks, you know?

595
00:45:22,401 --> 00:45:31,220
Scott: But if you show the restraint, any of the obstacles individually, or at least in the correct orientations, are conquerable, right?

596
00:45:31,381 --> 00:45:32,840
Scott: With some amount of flicks.

597
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,199
Scott: You know, we did, what, a two lap race, and we finished, right?

598
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:38,719
Scott: So, you know.

599
00:45:39,341 --> 00:45:44,460
Rym: And I guess, that is where, this is a game too, where that curation you described is very important.

600
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:54,060
Rym: Designing the track, not only is it super important, and, like, that's gonna determine if the game is fun or not, but, designing the track is itself fun.

601
00:45:54,860 --> 00:46:03,880
Rym: Like, I think half the fun of owning Pitchcar, or playing Pitchcar, is, you're sometimes the one who sets up the track for everyone to play.

602
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:08,160
Rym: Like, it would be fun, if you own this game, to take turns, who makes the track?

603
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,560
Rym: People who have different styles.

604
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:20,880
Rym: And there's a lot of debate among Pitchcar people, around what makes a good track, what makes a poor track, How are you gonna handle situations with a track like splits, or deviates, or does something crazy?

605
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:34,040
Rym: But I think a real key there, is you wanna design a track that has relatively easy, straightforward areas, that are connecting what you would consider to be relatively discreet challenges.

606
00:46:35,321 --> 00:46:40,240
Rym: Kinda like how good Mario Kart tracks are, or good actual real world race tracks are.

607
00:46:40,561 --> 00:46:46,560
Rym: Like, a race track has a long straightaway, a long straightaway, in and of itself, is not hard in a race car.

608
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:47,803
Scott: It is, somewhat.

609
00:46:47,923 --> 00:46:52,120
Scott: I mean, the difficulty of, you're trying to, you know, there is some challenge to it, right?

610
00:46:52,621 --> 00:47:00,780
Scott: You're putting on the maximum speed, you're flooring it, but you have to hit the brakes at some point, 'cause the straightaway will end, and it's like, how long do you floor it, when do you stop?

611
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,200
Scott: That's the challenge of a straightaway.

612
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:10,280
Scott: But it's not the same as the straightaway as the challenge of a complicated chicane with three turns that suddenly goes downhill.

613
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:11,740
Scott: That's, right.

614
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:16,440
Rym: And arguably, much of the challenge of the straightaway is defined by the chicane that's right after it.

615
00:47:16,641 --> 00:47:18,038
Rym: Or the corner that's right after it.

616
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:27,880
Rym: And the components of this game do a really good job of giving you the tools you need to make an interesting and compelling course for the flicking.

617
00:47:28,181 --> 00:47:32,719
Rym: Like, it's a fun game to play, I really enjoy it, I would play it again, pretty much any time.

618
00:47:34,961 --> 00:47:59,580
Rym: My only real complaint, other than, you know, it takes a long time to set up, long time to tear down, the components are a little fragile, and you might not have the space or the people who will not freak out to play it, is just that it's the kind of game, if you want to enjoy it, I feel like you want to play it regularly, in the same way that mini golf is the kind of game that's more fun if you play it regularly as opposed to just once a year.

619
00:48:01,141 --> 00:48:09,240
Scott: I think it's one of those things, I think mini golf can be fun if you play it regularly, but you would need more than one mini golf course, right?

620
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:16,902
Scott: If you're playing it the same mini golf, like if you owned a mini golf or worked at one, if you played that course every day and then you got really good at it, then it would have.

621
00:48:16,982 --> 00:48:27,166
Scott: no, right, with pitchcar, you can keep remixing the track, right, all the time, and that's what can keep it fresh, as you play it repeatedly and build your skills.

622
00:48:28,970 --> 00:48:33,220
Scott: But yeah, mini golf, you would need to go traveling around to different mini golfs, right?

623
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:39,840
Scott: Even regular golf, you have to go to different golf courses, playing the same regular golf course over and over, some people do that, but it's like, you know.

624
00:48:40,001 --> 00:48:43,680
Rym: I mean, those are the same people who play Counter-Strike, Dust2 only.

625
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:45,462
Scott: Exactly, right.

626
00:48:46,563 --> 00:49:05,700
Scott: Another thing about pitchcar is that, you know, if you make a long straightaway, you have to consider that if people are flicking properly, right, they're gonna try to get as much power as they can, and the disc is wood, it's like you can hurt your fingers playing pitchcar just on your own, flicking your own disc.

627
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:12,660
Rym: Because pitchcar is a dexterity game, and thus it is a sport, just like Jungle Speed, where you can break your finger.

628
00:49:13,481 --> 00:49:23,680
Scott: Right, it's like, if there's a long straightaway or the loop, it's like, the way to conquer those is indeed with power, like as much power as you can get is only gonna help you get through those obstacles.

629
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:23,820
Scott: I

630
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:43,860
Rym: gotta say, the finger hurting problem, I think partly a factor there is that we're all around 40 now, because when I was in middle school and high school, and I played a lot of flicking games, like we'd play a lot of games that involved flicking, like just various, like I don't have names for them, the games you'd play at a lunch table.

631
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,827
Rym: We'd flick each other, we'd play a flicking equivalent of punch for punch.

632
00:49:48,449 --> 00:49:53,479
Rym: Flicking did not hurt me at any point in my life until I was 40, and now flicking...

633
00:49:53,960 --> 00:50:00,400
Scott: I think it's because when I was flicking at the lunch table, it was like a cardboard trying, it was a piece of paper folded into a triangle of marbles.

634
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:06,451
Scott: I'm just saying, but I got the piece of wood, and you're trying to flick it as hard as you can, right?

635
00:50:06,471 --> 00:50:10,120
Scott: A marble, you're never trying to flick it as hard as you can, you're trying to flick it straight, right?

636
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:12,220
Rym: Sometimes with a brake marble, you're flicking hard.

637
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,558
Scott: Some power, but not necessarily as hard as, you know.

638
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:19,880
Rym: The thing is, marbles you're supposed to flick with the thumb up, and there's a different technique, but we're not talking about marbles, we could do a show on marbles.

639
00:50:21,001 --> 00:50:34,820
Scott: I think it would be cool, I think it wouldn't be feasible, but it would be cool if someone could make a pitchcar where the things you flicked, right, were somehow softer on the finger, but there was less friction, you know, they were a little slidey like air hockey pucks.

640
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:55,718
Rym: I think you could open up pitchcar itself to a broader audience, which would help the people we've encountered who get frustrated because they can't flick, if the game had devices that basically would hit the cars, kind of like you have your pallet of golf clubs.

641
00:50:55,738 --> 00:50:57,220
Rym: when you're playing golf, you have your pallet.

642
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:00,507
Scott: Like a little tiny thing, like hot wheels, right, is?

643
00:51:00,527 --> 00:51:05,460
Scott: you put the car on that little gun, and you, you know, you rev it up, you pull the string, and then you push.

644
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:17,880
Rym: So what if instead, you know, you have all your woods and irons in golf, if there were four devices with different powers and configurations, and every turn in pitchcar, you pick a device and use it instead of flicking.

645
00:51:18,321 --> 00:51:27,679
Rym: That would be a way to introduce a little bit of an ego shield and reduce the surprising barrier to entry that knowing how to flick seems to be.

646
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:31,446
Scott: Yeah, removes the necessary, you know, necessity of learning a technique, right?

647
00:51:31,466 --> 00:51:33,650
Scott: You have a device that does the flicking for you.

648
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:38,740
Scott: All you have to do is hold the device near the car, aim it, set its power, and push a button, right?

649
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:43,204
Scott: But I mean, you could also achieve that by playing pitchcar on like TTS or something, where it's like.

650
00:51:43,244 --> 00:51:59,080
Scott: basically, you know, you just, as a physics engine, you have a disc object in the 3D world, and you just apply a force at an angle and push the flick button, and it will flick the object, and the physics engine will guide it, and not the real world physics, so it's not exactly the same.

651
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:03,520
Scott: But, you know, you could, it's probably most of the fun, I imagine.

652
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:03,800
Scott: Yeah,

653
00:52:04,641 --> 00:52:22,100
Rym: so pitchcar, I would say, in terms of any, wrapping up the review, if you're the kind of person who hosts gaming events, or shows up to gaming events as "the one who brought the game," and you're like curating pitchcar experiences for other people, or want to do

654
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:22,200
Scott: that.

655
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:29,160
Scott: If there's a lot of people, if it's a, you know, a big atmosphere, a kid's birthday party who likes cars or games.

656
00:52:29,301 --> 00:52:33,520
Rym: If you got kids, if I had pitchcar as a kid, this would have been one of my favorite toys.

657
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:38,887
Scott: Yeah, it's like, it's a big event sort of showcase kind of deal, right?

658
00:52:38,907 --> 00:52:44,034
Scott: A convention or something like that, where you can set up the pitchcar and organize it, right?

659
00:52:44,074 --> 00:52:48,260
Scott: It takes effort to make it happen, but it's, you know, it's worth it if you're going to do that.

660
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:59,260
Scott: But it's like, just having a pitchcar on the shelf with all your other board games, it's like, maybe if you don't have any expansions, just a little one, it's like, maybe, but is it really going to get pulled out?

661
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:01,660
Scott: It's like, I don't really see that happening, right?

662
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:06,100
Scott: Which I would say- Just because the people waiting for you to set up the track, it's like, you know.

663
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:06,581
Scott: Yeah.

664
00:53:06,861 --> 00:53:16,017
Rym: Meanwhile, when we were at our thing, our friend Matt, we just like, I went off somewhere and I come back and the pool table is covered in like an F1 quality pitchcar track.

665
00:53:16,057 --> 00:53:17,820
Rym: And I'm like, what's going on here?

666
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:18,721
Scott: Yeah.

667
00:53:18,781 --> 00:53:22,950
Scott: And it's like, well, I guess that's going to happen now because someone went through the effort to make it happen.

668
00:53:23,271 --> 00:53:27,240
Scott: If not for that person, it doesn't, you know, that would have just sat on the shelf there.

669
00:53:28,221 --> 00:53:32,085
Scott: At no point would someone have said, let's set up the pitchcar, right?

670
00:53:32,866 --> 00:53:35,169
Scott: But someone independently set up the pitchcar.

671
00:53:35,449 --> 00:53:36,010
Scott: There it is.

672
00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:38,753
Scott: And they said, I have prepared for you the pitchcar.

673
00:53:38,833 --> 00:53:39,614
Scott: It is here now.

674
00:53:39,955 --> 00:53:41,837
Scott: Let us play at the appointed time, right?

675
00:53:42,317 --> 00:53:42,938
Scott: And so it was.

676
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:52,606
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

677
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:57,640
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

678
00:53:58,001 --> 00:54:03,040
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

679
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:05,987
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

680
00:54:06,107 --> 00:54:10,720
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

682
00:54:15,508 --> 00:54:18,574
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

683
00:54:18,774 --> 00:54:21,680
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

684
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:25,844
Rym: And the Patreon Patreons for this episode of GeekNights.

685
00:54:26,264 --> 00:54:44,680
Rym: Alan Joyce, Link E. G, Dreadily, The Tenderbread, Casey Care, Makes Music, Chris, Don, Clinton, Walton, Dex, Finn, Joel Hayes, Rebecca Dunn, Sam Erickson, Sherman Von Hurl, and tons of people who do not want me to say their names or are giving a tiny appropriate amount like a dollar or a pound or a euro per month.

686
00:54:45,321 --> 00:54:49,627
Rym: Just probably, I assume, so you can get access to that pretty good RSS feed that's in there.

687
00:54:50,247 --> 00:54:59,680
Rym: Anyway, yeah, GeekNights is back, PAX is back, I got nothing new, Emily's been out of town for the last week, so I've been playing a lot of Overwatch and also working on some secret projects.

688
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:10,543
Rym: But anyway, right now, I got nothing, I'm real hungry, and I'm gonna go out to eat because I am lazy and in goblin mode, so I leave you only with... ♪.
