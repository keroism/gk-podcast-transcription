Rym: every year for the like 15 years We got all kinds of hiatuses.

8
00:00:26,398 --> 00:00:27,685
Scott: No one's paying us to do this shit.

9
00:00:27,745 --> 00:00:30,519
Scott: Yeah We hate us whenever we want.

10
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:36,090
Rym: GeekNights makes dozens of dollars a month from YouTube read mostly or whatever they call it now YouTube premium.

11
00:00:36,251 --> 00:00:38,603
Scott: You know what the difference is between us and the other hiatuses.

12
00:00:38,643 --> 00:00:39,407
Scott: you always come back.

13
00:00:39,448 --> 00:00:43,203
Scott: so far We've come back every time yep podcast rise and fall.

14
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:46,918
Rym: We just only not us and penny arcade Just keep fucking going and the Simpsons.

15
00:00:46,938 --> 00:00:47,842
Rym: They just keep going.

16
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:50,094
Scott: penny arcade doesn't hate us though I don't know.

17
00:00:50,114 --> 00:00:52,470
Scott: they've missed a strip in in 20.

18
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:56,485
Rym: They were more diligent about getting guests to do strips when they like couldn't do one.

19
00:00:56,706 --> 00:00:57,770
Rym: we did that a few times.

20
00:00:58,274 --> 00:01:00,795
Scott: It's like they always upload Something.

21
00:01:01,037 --> 00:01:02,405
Rym: I should try that again next time.

22
00:01:02,425 --> 00:01:03,130
Rym: we have to go to hate us.

23
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:08,609
Rym: I we should or I should arrange like we did those few times to get guests to the show because the formats really is

24
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:11,829
Scott: it's But they they make their livelihood off it in which you know yeah

25
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:12,834
Rym: I mean we if we

26
00:01:12,874 --> 00:01:16,230
Scott: lived off this then yeah, I would make sure there was always something uploaded.

27
00:01:17,451 --> 00:01:22,070
Scott: No, cuz if cuz think about it if somebody was like actually paying money for this like let's say it was we were taking.

28
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:25,080
Rym: Oh, if this was our job there would be ever ads.

29
00:01:25,301 --> 00:01:27,850
Scott: not putting up episodes means reducing our inventory.

30
00:01:28,432 --> 00:01:29,417
Scott: No money comes in wait.

31
00:01:29,457 --> 00:01:35,021
Rym: you just called it inventory meaning you definitely were reading up on ad tech And I read the whole Google thing.

32
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:36,530
Scott: that's gonna be our news in two seconds.

33
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:42,127
Scott: And then you know if we were getting paid by patrons right that and it wasn't this.

34
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:45,478
Scott: you know some bullshit patron But a real one that I told people to pay for.

35
00:01:45,498 --> 00:01:49,894
Scott: yeah, it's like we'd have we'd have an obligation to them Which we don't have right now.

36
00:01:49,934 --> 00:01:50,697
Scott: They're just right now.

37
00:01:50,738 --> 00:01:53,810
Scott: They're just fools paying for no guarantees of anything whatsoever.

38
00:01:53,891 --> 00:02:00,706
Rym: Yeah Plus if I could do this full-time and live the life of now I definitely would like.

39
00:02:00,907 --> 00:02:06,077
Rym: no question We would never miss a show You want to talk about your.

40
00:02:06,338 --> 00:02:11,400
Scott: you finally skied in a superior ski And I want to point out full disclosure.

41
00:02:11,801 --> 00:02:14,552
Rym: for like months leading up to the ski trip I kept

42
00:02:14,954 --> 00:02:15,396
Scott: saying

43
00:02:16,059 --> 00:02:26,405
Rym: off and on in real life and GeekNights all over the place like yeah It's gonna be pretty easy Pretty sure it's gonna be really easy because like East Coast snow is all like ice and bullshit and like I learned in the hardest conditions you can learn in.

44
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:30,450
Rym: so Every indication is that big mountain West Coast skiing.

45
00:02:30,511 --> 00:02:35,745
Rym: It's just gonna be like so easy And I'm just gonna be doing like the craziest trails having a great time, and you know what.

46
00:02:35,765 --> 00:02:36,950
Scott: sure that's exactly right.

47
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:37,913
Rym: It was exactly right.

48
00:02:38,254 --> 00:02:45,159
Rym: Holy shit is skiing easy as hell on West Coast snow and The people are also.

49
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,547
Scott: if you went to the Alps would be the same.

50
00:02:46,588 --> 00:02:48,795
Rym: probably Yeah, except the Alps have no snow.

51
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:49,878
Rym: they are also the Andes.

52
00:02:49,999 --> 00:02:50,661
Scott: Andes is.

53
00:02:50,701 --> 00:02:58,485
Rym: the Alps have worse conditions this year than like Hunter Mountain does In New York State, I'm sure it varies year to year, but no this is the first time in recorded history.

54
00:02:58,545 --> 00:02:59,287
Rym: It's been this bad.

55
00:02:59,328 --> 00:03:01,533
Rym: It's like Catastrophic point.

56
00:03:01,573 --> 00:03:04,184
Scott: is the outside way better than whatever in New York has?

57
00:03:04,264 --> 00:03:10,606
Rym: yeah, yeah until this year The Alps are like the West, but this year there's other places with a good skiing like Iran.

58
00:03:10,667 --> 00:03:11,630
Scott: Iran has good skiing.

59
00:03:11,771 --> 00:03:12,415
Rym: Yeah, actually.

60
00:03:12,455 --> 00:03:14,326
Rym: so get this the pass the epic pass that we get.

61
00:03:14,366 --> 00:03:14,970
Rym: that covers vale.

62
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:19,470
Rym: It covers Hunter Mountain like the mountain here that we ski like the local crappy one.

63
00:03:19,891 --> 00:03:29,128
Rym: Oh, it's like one pass you can buy and you can just use it to ski everything in the epic network that veil like the Company owns which includes Vale the resort like that's the home base resort.

64
00:03:30,412 --> 00:03:32,884
Rym: lift tickets for a day at Vale are 250 bucks.

65
00:03:32,904 --> 00:03:41,995
Rym: a Season pass that includes 10 days at Vale plus unlimited skiing like fucking everywhere else in the East Coast is like 600 bucks.

66
00:03:43,717 --> 00:03:48,790
Rym: So So the pass we already used to ski at our dumpy mountain just made Vale skiing free.

67
00:03:49,213 --> 00:03:50,748
Rym: We just had to pay for the place in the lift ticket.

68
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:54,403
Rym: But uh, so I learned a few things skiing out there one.

69
00:03:54,423 --> 00:03:57,378
Rym: Yeah, it's just better in every possible way Like I.

70
00:03:57,459 --> 00:03:57,842
Scott: that's why.

71
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,030
Scott: that's why it's a cost.

72
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:03,163
Scott: You know if you want to buy a house in Vale How much does it cost if you want to buy a house in Hunter?

73
00:04:03,203 --> 00:04:04,330
Scott: if you want to buy a house in Hunter Mountain?

74
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:05,028
Scott: What does it cost?

75
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,775
Rym: Scarily houses near Hunter Mountain.

76
00:04:07,795 --> 00:04:11,930
Scott: The Hunter Mountain skiing was as good as the as the other skiing the house in Hunter Mountain.

77
00:04:12,071 --> 00:04:13,239
Scott: houses in Vale are.

78
00:04:15,552 --> 00:04:22,449
Rym: They're not as Expenses as you would expect because you will think about New York City pricing and it's kind of comparable.

79
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:22,810
Rym: actually.

80
00:04:23,354 --> 00:04:28,850
Scott: well, but the thing is you get a Right, you're paying a lot, but you're paying for it to be close to the skiing.

81
00:04:29,151 --> 00:04:33,770
Scott: But unlike New York right where you're in New York, you're paying to be in the New York.

82
00:04:34,332 --> 00:04:36,601
Scott: So that evens out doesn't even out.

83
00:04:36,642 --> 00:04:40,220
Scott: being in the New York is way better than me near the skiing But you get a lot.

84
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,769
Scott: you're gonna get a more house out there.

85
00:04:42,071 --> 00:04:45,690
Rym: Oh, yeah, but not that much more because Vale is you're not gonna get some tiny apartment.

86
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:53,454
Rym: Vale is in this mountain pass where there's like a regional airport and there's one road in and out on either side of the valley And that's it.

87
00:04:53,957 --> 00:04:55,406
Scott: Yeah, there's no public transportation.

88
00:04:55,446 --> 00:04:56,110
Scott: other there is.

89
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:56,912
Scott: He shut all this.

90
00:04:57,073 --> 00:04:59,501
Rym: the the town of Vale the actual like city.

91
00:04:59,521 --> 00:05:02,450
Rym: there all public transportation is free for anyone.

92
00:05:02,531 --> 00:05:05,068
Rym: They don't check anything buses just come and go it all just works.

93
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,564
Scott: Well, yeah, but it's not like there's a. there's a train.

94
00:05:07,584 --> 00:05:08,530
Scott: It's like a major city.

95
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:09,073
Scott: It's like it's.

96
00:05:09,294 --> 00:05:12,290
Scott: you know, the town is just a town that exists for skiing.

97
00:05:12,351 --> 00:05:13,148
Scott: It's not like this.

98
00:05:13,273 --> 00:05:17,324
Rym: Yeah The town only exists for skiing and other outdoor recreation like it's like.

99
00:05:17,464 --> 00:05:19,130
Scott: it's like there's people who live in Wildwood.

100
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:19,894
Scott: There's a school there.

101
00:05:19,934 --> 00:05:20,718
Scott: We see it right.

102
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,447
Scott: Well, it's really a beach.

103
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:28,810
Scott: No Yeah, the majority of people there are there for the beach and the people who live there are people who live there.

104
00:05:29,251 --> 00:05:41,828
Rym: So one thing I learned I've never been that high long enough to have altitude sickness before and I and everyone in the group Except one of us George had altitude sickness the first day like we just yeah, that's that makes sense.

105
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:43,294
Scott: Yeah, it's real It's not a joke.

106
00:05:43,395 --> 00:05:43,736
Rym: It was funny.

107
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:46,250
Rym: We land and we're walking her like we're getting our stuff and we feel fine.

108
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:51,907
Rym: We're like, all right I'm a little lightheaded but this is fine that we get to the place and it's a two-story like condo we're staying in.

109
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:55,904
Rym: we walked Up the stairs and I had to stop near the top.

110
00:05:55,964 --> 00:06:07,648
Scott: I ran out of breath that first day Like I was like, yeah I mean if I even if I skied or let's say I went there to bike I guess with the snow melted Right, I would not do it for like 24 hours after getting.

111
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:08,150
Rym: that's what we did.

112
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:13,187
Rym: We fly we flew in that morning and the first day was just acclimate to the altitude.

113
00:06:13,809 --> 00:06:15,989
Scott: Yep I mean, I always remember that one dude.

114
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:22,630
Scott: I forget what team he played for but he was an NFL player and they had a game against the Broncos in Denver.

115
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:27,707
Scott: And he like, you know, this wasn't a football problem.

116
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:28,410
Scott: It right.

117
00:06:28,531 --> 00:06:31,990
Scott: It wasn't like someone hit him real hard like good recent situations, right?

118
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,940
Scott: It was just due to altitude sickness.

119
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:38,865
Scott: He had you know, there's a name for it I think or it's like it's extremely emergency.

120
00:06:38,905 --> 00:06:39,428
Scott: You could dive.

121
00:06:39,568 --> 00:06:39,870
Rym: Oh, yeah.

122
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:47,597
Scott: So basically and you can basically if you have whatever condition that guy has you just can't do Strand you his physical activity.

123
00:06:47,677 --> 00:06:54,043
Rym: So it's like period or you'll die in that It's kind of random like fitness age all.

124
00:06:54,063 --> 00:06:55,710
Scott: I think it's more rare than seasickness.

125
00:06:56,933 --> 00:07:00,410
Rym: One in four people will experience acute mountain sickness, but us much smaller.

126
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,770
Scott: We're talking about the dying level of yeah.

127
00:07:03,531 --> 00:07:08,210
Rym: So we were watching for the symptoms because the first day like we all just had a headache and felt like shit all day.

128
00:07:08,631 --> 00:07:10,136
Rym: But then the next day woke up felt great.

129
00:07:10,477 --> 00:07:15,033
Rym: I skied like 150 miles over the course of the week and every day I went harder.

130
00:07:15,113 --> 00:07:19,810
Rym: I got 89 runs in and those runs are like six times longer than run 100 Mountain.

131
00:07:20,251 --> 00:07:24,545
Rym: I skied more and they'll in those five days, but I think I skied in the last three years combined.

132
00:07:24,565 --> 00:07:32,048
Scott: It was amazing And I'm sure when you come back down the mountain you're like, oh so much oxygen you get like, huh?

133
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:39,490
Rym: Yeah Oh when we got back home like right after we landed the next day I played DDR just to see because it was too cold to get brought outside.

134
00:07:40,147 --> 00:07:43,201
Rym: Yeah my heart rate was just lower while I was working out like way lower.

135
00:07:43,642 --> 00:07:57,410
Rym: and if you look at my Google or my Apple watch chart of resting heart rate and like average heart rate and blood o2 You see it's almost like a chart of how long have we been in vale because it's the heart rate Skyrockets and then slowly drops day by day while we're there.

136
00:07:59,131 --> 00:08:00,377
Rym: But the skiing was amazing.

137
00:08:00,498 --> 00:08:01,925
Rym: I was like off in these back bolt.

138
00:08:01,945 --> 00:08:03,070
Rym: There's like a front side of the mountain.

139
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,615
Rym: That's like normal mountain like ski resort.

140
00:08:04,676 --> 00:08:05,860
Rym: That's just big like giant.

141
00:08:06,382 --> 00:08:08,750
Rym: behind it are these giant bowls.

142
00:08:09,112 --> 00:08:11,670
Rym: Just ski in any direction like all the way down the mountain.

143
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,256
Rym: It just funnels you into a lot.

144
00:08:13,277 --> 00:08:16,450
Scott: the lodges at the bottom and there's the lifts go like every which way.

145
00:08:16,651 --> 00:08:24,862
Rym: So they'll know the lodges are at the bottom of the front side and on the top and in the middle the back side Like a multi lodge, yeah the back side of the mountain.

146
00:08:24,882 --> 00:08:27,070
Rym: you go off the other back end of the mountain into a bowl.

147
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:30,240
Rym: There's nothing at the bottom except lifts like it's just in the middle of the wilderness.

148
00:08:30,762 --> 00:08:33,169
Rym: or you take a lift even further out.

149
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:37,610
Rym: There's a. we got to this blue sky basin that takes like 45 minutes of ski down.

150
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:43,155
Rym: Ride a lift ski down ride a different lift ski down ride a different list to get to this other Basin way in the back.

151
00:08:43,496 --> 00:08:46,045
Rym: Oh, okay, which was also I seem to remember the one.

152
00:08:46,106 --> 00:08:47,310
Scott: I just remember seeing one.

153
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,059
Scott: I don't remember where I saw it where there was.

154
00:08:49,119 --> 00:08:52,775
Scott: basically you drive up and there's like You know parking lot, right?

155
00:08:52,815 --> 00:08:57,110
Scott: Yeah, and there's like one lift that just go and it's like that's it one lift.

156
00:08:57,593 --> 00:08:59,589
Scott: And then the other side is a bowl.

157
00:09:00,103 --> 00:09:04,021
Scott: Yeah and the lodge is at the bottom in the middle and the lifts on the.

158
00:09:04,121 --> 00:09:17,084
Scott: once you're in the bowl go basically every possible direction North South East West and you can ski basically From you know on the north side on the west side and no matter where you ski You end up at the lodge at the bottom so you could go do the north side.

159
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:18,309
Rym: then this place is so big.

160
00:09:19,372 --> 00:09:24,468
Scott: You'll end up and then when you want to go home You have to use the one lift that goes to the other side of the mountain where the car.

161
00:09:24,488 --> 00:09:24,950
Rym: that's typical.

162
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:25,835
Rym: This place is just it's.

163
00:09:25,996 --> 00:09:28,732
Rym: it's literally like the biggest in North America I think.

164
00:09:28,792 --> 00:09:36,700
Rym: like it is so big that you'll be you could travel to a different area Basically just by skiing and more.

165
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,590
Scott: so I'd be you know, I'd be surprised if it was not good.

166
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:43,990
Scott: It's like why the hell is yeah, everyone go into that place if it's the not good place, right?

167
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:51,250
Rym: Yep, and I also I finally now I really strange like I leveled up my skiing I was doing some really fun dire stuff.

168
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:56,495
Rym: I skied down some like black diamond ridiculous bowls and Also, somehow you made it back.

169
00:09:56,595 --> 00:09:58,341
Rym: cuz I'm a real fucking good skier.

170
00:09:58,482 --> 00:10:00,227
Rym: and now I have confirmed this.

171
00:10:00,448 --> 00:10:05,484
Scott: Absolutely Yeah, we'll see Rym goes to get next year up.

172
00:10:05,846 --> 00:10:06,630
Rym: I'm going back every year.

173
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:07,773
Rym: I know I will.

174
00:10:07,954 --> 00:10:12,046
Rym: I will prioritize being able to ski at a place like that every year from now on.

175
00:10:12,427 --> 00:10:13,490
Rym: it is so worth it.

176
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,458
Scott: And then in three years from now, there's no snow.

177
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,850
Rym: So we were talking to all the Colorado has the most snow ever.

178
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:22,743
Rym: So at least for the short term Colorado and Utah are doing fine.

179
00:10:22,964 --> 00:10:24,049
Rym: The rest of the world is F'd.

180
00:10:24,612 --> 00:10:29,370
Scott: I mean this year was not the last year of snow, but Someday, it is depressing.

181
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:42,349
Rym: Oh, it is depressing to think about the fact that unless humans radically change course in a way that our governments won't let us I May live to see a day where children are like, yeah There used to be this sport called skiing that weird like white people did.

182
00:10:44,432 --> 00:10:45,845
Scott: Now you can only do it in Antarctica.

183
00:10:46,007 --> 00:10:49,998
Rym: Yeah But yeah, I'll post some photos later and stop.

184
00:10:50,138 --> 00:10:52,767
Scott: meanwhile those kids live in Antarctica because it's so warm.

185
00:10:52,787 --> 00:10:54,734
Scott: we start building Civilization down there.

186
00:10:54,895 --> 00:11:00,757
Rym: I also tried the kinds of skis that don't work on the East Coast because the East Coast is all like icy Bullshit, so you need like stupid skis.

187
00:11:01,258 --> 00:11:03,687
Scott: I just use regular old keys with you and then you rent.

188
00:11:03,828 --> 00:11:04,510
Scott: or did you just rent?

189
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,909
Rym: We just rented there and we rented from a fancy place.

190
00:11:07,271 --> 00:11:13,235
Rym: So they would give us skis based on our preferences and ability and we could even carry any skis there And we'd swap.

191
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:15,564
Scott: you're carrying skis though is easier than carrying bikes.

192
00:11:15,805 --> 00:11:22,530
Rym: So, uh, yeah Most people bring their skis, but the skis I use on the East Coast would not work on real snow.

193
00:11:23,491 --> 00:11:29,600
Rym: They're designed for shitty icy snow because 90% of the time that's what I'm skiing on out here Mm-hmm.

194
00:11:30,714 --> 00:11:35,581
Rym: But now that I've tried those other kinds of skis, too They're so much more fun and I really but I couldn't.

195
00:11:36,164 --> 00:11:39,347
Rym: I don't think I could use them here Like I don't think they would work.

196
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:41,935
Scott: Bikes are so much easier.

197
00:11:41,955 --> 00:11:43,522
Scott: It's just like does it have two wheels?

198
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:44,306
Scott: Yeah, does it work?

199
00:11:44,447 --> 00:11:45,230
Rym: Are you going downhill?

200
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:46,695
Rym: What kind of suspension does it have?

201
00:11:46,756 --> 00:11:47,981
Scott: It doesn't need any of that.

202
00:11:48,021 --> 00:11:49,648
Scott: You just have two wheels is go.

203
00:11:49,789 --> 00:11:51,109
Scott: You're good You can ride it anywhere.

204
00:11:53,353 --> 00:11:56,350
Scott: Might not be the perfect one, but it's gonna work, right?

205
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:59,125
Rym: Well, we did on that bike tour across New York Emily and I did.

206
00:11:59,146 --> 00:11:59,850
Rym: in the summer.

207
00:12:00,392 --> 00:12:09,430
Rym: we ended up in the last segment on an actual mountain biking trail in our track like our Hybrid bikes with heavy panniers on the back and we made it down just fine.

208
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:12,866
Rym: But I gotta say that is not comfortable without a suspension.

209
00:12:12,947 --> 00:12:13,590
Rym: Good fucking God.

210
00:12:14,471 --> 00:12:16,317
Scott: But just say it's like, you know, it's never see.

211
00:12:16,338 --> 00:12:18,907
Scott: you said this situation where the skis won't work, right?

212
00:12:19,328 --> 00:12:24,941
Rym: Yeah Down by mountain work I could just like a hybrid bike.

213
00:12:24,961 --> 00:12:25,824
Rym: I could get down the mountain.

214
00:12:25,844 --> 00:12:27,230
Rym: you know what I couldn't do carve.

215
00:12:29,474 --> 00:12:37,549
Scott: Anyway, anyway in the new whole bunch of shit happened Thanks to the hiatus and we're gonna talk all about it today and then forget all about it next show episode.

216
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:43,510
Rym: Yeah, but briefly because this is so big that we almost can't talk about it.

217
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:49,054
Rym: But we got to talk about the fact that this is a thing that's growing pretty much the only news It's so big pretty much.

218
00:12:49,114 --> 00:12:50,759
Rym: Well, the Google thing is secondary to this.

219
00:12:51,301 --> 00:12:53,106
Rym: pretty much every tech company.

220
00:12:53,527 --> 00:12:56,576
Rym: It has done Massive layoffs in the past.

221
00:12:56,596 --> 00:13:05,410
Rym: that's big but there's not too much to say about it other than well other than that It is a such a rapid contraction of the technology world globally.

222
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:06,555
Rym: It's not even just the u.s.

223
00:13:06,615 --> 00:13:25,967
Rym: Like Google laid off 12,000 people Facebook laid off 11,000 Amazon 10,000 Microsoft 10 or 11,000 Salesforce 8,000 Amazon 8,000. there so far There have been almost 300,000 layoffs just among large Technology firms almost entirely in engineering and technology disciplines.

224
00:13:26,408 --> 00:13:26,910
Scott: Yeah, okay.

225
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:28,775
Scott: So why is this happening?

226
00:13:28,795 --> 00:13:31,663
Scott: and the and the truth of the matter is right.

227
00:13:31,763 --> 00:13:39,949
Scott: if you try to figure out no company is gonna Give you tell you the truth about what the executives were saying in the meeting and what they decided, right?

228
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:46,149
Scott: But if you read experts people who used to be executives people executives other companies, right?

229
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:49,019
Scott: People who are reliable and not evil right?

230
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,830
Scott: The truth is why are they doing this, right?

231
00:13:52,311 --> 00:14:01,669
Scott: Well, it's a time in which there's some inflation going on prices on things some things are rising and Companies want to cut costs, right?

232
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,818
Scott: Because you you.

233
00:14:04,281 --> 00:14:07,101
Scott: it's not as it's easy to cut costs You just you could just do it.

234
00:14:07,223 --> 00:14:11,363
Scott: if you're an executive You can just order your company you can just say the word and costs are cut.

235
00:14:11,403 --> 00:14:13,230
Scott: you stop spending money that you have, right?

236
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:14,455
Rym: You're just still projects.

237
00:14:14,797 --> 00:14:20,080
Scott: You can't say the word and bump revenues up Unless you're crooked.

238
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,017
Rym: we'll talk about Google in a little bit Unless you're crooked.

239
00:14:23,057 --> 00:14:25,330
Scott: You can't say the word and just get revenues, right?

240
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:30,550
Scott: You actually have to do work to get revenues and succeed and make right bets and do right.

241
00:14:30,751 --> 00:14:32,439
Scott: It's you might you know, it's it's not?

242
00:14:32,641 --> 00:14:34,249
Scott: you can't automatically get more money.

243
00:14:34,651 --> 00:14:42,150
Scott: Yeah, so when companies look to cut costs, right companies right now are cutting costs in many other areas, right?

244
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:45,450
Scott: They're trying to cut costs on technology like the actual computers.

245
00:14:46,133 --> 00:14:47,799
Scott: How how can we cut our odds?

246
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,370
Scott: spending is like a huge conversation?

247
00:14:50,893 --> 00:14:56,390
Rym: Shut down data centers, can we like Minimize service we give to customers anything.

248
00:14:56,530 --> 00:15:07,970
Scott: how can we provide the same good or service that our company provides as its core business to maintain our revenues But spend less money, right?

249
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:13,410
Scott: What can we stop spending money on and still operate because we don't like the way that the markets looking.

250
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,979
Scott: We don't like how prices on other thing.

251
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:16,889
Scott: other people are raising their prices on us.

252
00:15:17,492 --> 00:15:20,950
Scott: We can raise our prices but other people are raising their prices.

253
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:25,970
Scott: So it's like, you know, it's like that's an increased profits that just raises a bunch of number makes a bunch of numbers bigger.

254
00:15:26,354 --> 00:15:33,330
Scott: yeah, so Cutting labor is an enormous cost at any company.

255
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:41,000
Rym: It's the biggest cost in most industries everywhere including technology industries Especially in a place like the US.

256
00:15:41,281 --> 00:15:52,547
Scott: right when you hire an employee Let's say you hire an employee whose salary is a hundred K. that Employee probably costs the company 200 K because of the other hundred K of stuff.

257
00:15:52,627 --> 00:16:02,872
Scott: They have to pay for Right all the other stuff they got to pay for for that employee It's you.

258
00:16:02,912 --> 00:16:05,621
Scott: basically double the salary is what they actually cost the cup.

259
00:16:05,661 --> 00:16:12,137
Scott: Yeah 401k matches all kinds of shit All right, so when you fire people right lay them off.

260
00:16:12,819 --> 00:16:21,410
Scott: even when you pay Severance to everybody it's like yeah in the short term your pay your cost basically stay the same because I paid severance.

261
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,610
Scott: It doesn't cost you more, right?

262
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:28,910
Scott: And then after that six months or whatever of severance and you stop paying all those people.

263
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:31,739
Scott: Now your profits go up even though your revenues are the same.

264
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:43,324
Scott: Yeah, and the thing is companies right now For a long period of time, you know the past many years Companies weren't concerned with profits really especially not in the tech sector.

265
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:45,170
Scott: They were concerned with numbers, right?

266
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,394
Scott: How many you know?

267
00:16:46,515 --> 00:16:48,463
Scott: user accounts did you get signed up?

268
00:16:48,523 --> 00:16:50,090
Scott: Are you growing Sun, right?

269
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,214
Scott: It's like they're.

270
00:16:51,254 --> 00:16:54,930
Rym: how many views you got how many they wanted competitive advantage?

271
00:16:55,151 --> 00:16:58,510
Rym: So if you have a competitor and they're hiring like crazy, what are you gonna do?

272
00:16:58,650 --> 00:16:59,877
Rym: You're also gonna hire like crazy.

273
00:16:59,897 --> 00:17:01,970
Scott: how many subscribers he got Netflix, right?

274
00:17:02,431 --> 00:17:03,876
Scott: And but what's happened recently?

275
00:17:03,896 --> 00:17:14,929
Scott: is you know the reality that should have been there all along which is investors stopped asking how many subscribers he got and you know started asking how much profit are you making?

276
00:17:14,969 --> 00:17:15,109
Scott: and the?

277
00:17:15,553 --> 00:17:16,703
Scott: We're not profitable.

278
00:17:16,743 --> 00:17:17,388
Scott: We never have been.

279
00:17:18,023 --> 00:17:18,209
Rym: Yep.

280
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,537
Rym: But also consumer spending.

281
00:17:20,738 --> 00:17:26,015
Rym: irrespective of inflation going up consumer spending is dropping in the u.s For a number of reasons

282
00:17:26,317 --> 00:17:36,793
Scott: partly someone like me who can afford to pay for things I've been just going through and looking at what I spend money on and Canceling things, you know I stop when I see high

283
00:17:36,813 --> 00:17:37,275
Rym: prices.

284
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:39,201
Scott: It's like could I afford to buy $10 cream cheese?

285
00:17:42,331 --> 00:17:42,672
Scott: I could.

286
00:17:42,772 --> 00:17:48,150
Scott: I am that fortunate that I could but it's like I'm not paying fucking $10 for cream cheese.

287
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,415
Scott: I'm gonna get the cream cheese.

288
00:17:49,495 --> 00:17:53,410
Rym: I like less for $4, you know, I paid because it was the only option.

289
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:58,870
Rym: I thought I paid over a dollar an egg to buy a dozen eggs in vale so we could cook breakfast.

290
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:03,906
Scott: Oh, okay, but I'm thinking right even me I could afford to buy the $5 dozen eggs.

291
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,079
Scott: Yeah, usually they used to cost about $12 in vale.

292
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:13,090
Scott: Oh my god I could afford to buy $5 eggs at the overpriced New York grocery store.

293
00:18:13,431 --> 00:18:13,994
Scott: But you know what?

294
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:14,677
Scott: I'm probably.

295
00:18:14,757 --> 00:18:17,810
Scott: I think we should go to Costco buy a whole tray of eggs and split them, right?

296
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:19,294
Rym: You know, I got the car.

297
00:18:19,314 --> 00:18:21,623
Rym: be really easy to distribute that among our collective friends.

298
00:18:21,985 --> 00:18:22,607
Scott: We don't need a car.

299
00:18:22,627 --> 00:18:23,190
Scott: get a little wagon.

300
00:18:24,032 --> 00:18:24,739
Rym: Well, what are gonna get?

301
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:25,910
Rym: you can take that wagon out to Flushing?

302
00:18:26,832 --> 00:18:30,650
Scott: Yeah, people everyone can come over have a little party and everyone take egg party egg party.

303
00:18:31,773 --> 00:18:34,232
Rym: Anyway, but also I like that Consuming.

304
00:18:34,915 --> 00:18:39,430
Scott: I even I have been anecdotally recently past few months, right?

305
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:42,729
Scott: You know cost-conscious and companies are doing the same thing.

306
00:18:42,894 --> 00:18:44,549
Rym: Yep but another thing going on is.

307
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:49,609
Rym: Americans are poorer than they've been in a long time for all the reasons you can imagine.

308
00:18:49,669 --> 00:18:59,386
Rym: like a lot of people lost their jobs a lot of people are being paid less a lot of people lost a Caregiver or someone who worked in their family because kovat killed so many people.

309
00:18:59,486 --> 00:19:07,970
Rym: like we're in an unprecedented time in Like the history of the American economy never mind the rest of the world world world economy, too.

310
00:19:08,471 --> 00:19:12,785
Rym: But America's got like extra stupid problems on top of the general problems of the world.

311
00:19:12,945 --> 00:19:14,510
Scott: Yeah, it's like we got other issues, right?

312
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,213
Scott: You got like the eggs We just talked about.

313
00:19:16,233 --> 00:19:20,710
Scott: it's like is that because of it's good the bird the bird flu killed all the chickens.

314
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:32,241
Rym: But also right even if we didn't kill all that if there was no bird flu The eggs were only ever that cheap in the first place because of the extreme exploitation of both chickens and the humans who deal with the chickens.

315
00:19:32,743 --> 00:19:45,230
Rym: indeed if we have any society in the world paid a living wage and what it cost in human misery and Dealt with the externalities of even simple stuff like eggs our entire system collapses.

316
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:45,765
Rym: Yeah.

317
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:52,113
Scott: So basically the way you think about it is you're playing Sim City and someone goes to the menu and like clicks on five Disasters at once.

318
00:19:52,133 --> 00:19:56,868
Scott: yeah, right and the Godzilla comes in and it's like the end result of all those disasters.

319
00:19:56,928 --> 00:20:02,090
Scott: when it you know It's like boils down to how it affects the tech companies is lay a bunch of people off?

320
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:04,049
Rym: Yeah, so that's a little bit.

321
00:20:05,753 --> 00:20:08,988
Rym: One of them lays off the all the other ones can do the same and they get all cut.

322
00:20:09,651 --> 00:20:15,094
Scott: Yes, a lot of them are not doing it due to some internal logic They have of like they've.

323
00:20:15,134 --> 00:20:16,278
Scott: they calculated it wherever.

324
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:25,072
Scott: they're copycatting or you know meeting market Expectations or trying to hit estimates or you know, they're doing it just because they don't even fucking know Why.

325
00:20:25,092 --> 00:20:31,588
Scott: I read a study about like, you know Our layoffs a good idea how to companies decide to do them and and do they benefit?

326
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:32,070
Scott: and you know what?

327
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,240
Scott: The fact is layoffs usually don't help companies.

328
00:20:35,521 --> 00:20:41,110
Scott: It's it doesn't usually actually yeah You know create the positive impact that they think it does and they keep doing it.

329
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:53,038
Rym: Anyway this I don't want to belabor the point But if you look back to where things really started to go weird in America Before the mid-70s a lot of companies higher had a lot of just extra employees around who weren't doing that much.

330
00:20:53,058 --> 00:20:58,529
Rym: that was important and that was that sort of provided a glue to Society because a lot of people made enough money to live.

331
00:20:59,011 --> 00:21:02,404
Rym: But not everyone had to work that hard in a lot of big companies.

332
00:21:02,926 --> 00:21:07,330
Rym: and then as companies realize Hey, we'll be better off if we trim the fat and just work more efficiently.

333
00:21:07,411 --> 00:21:14,028
Rym: That was good for the company but it was bad for people because it turned out there weren't enough jobs that companies were willing to pay a living wage for.

334
00:21:14,048 --> 00:21:19,249
Rym: and That's sort of that spiral sort of continued into today and now is continuing even further.

335
00:21:19,892 --> 00:21:25,650
Scott: You know the last thing I want to say right is that one notable tech company, right?

336
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:30,950
Scott: Not to toot their horn because we can certainly criticize them has yet to lay people off.

337
00:21:31,131 --> 00:21:32,098
Rym: I can say something better.

338
00:21:32,138 --> 00:21:41,850
Rym: the company I work for we're hiring in fact, if you listening are a software engineer my tiny little company will hire - but We're not time.

339
00:21:42,011 --> 00:21:48,230
Scott: We're talking like, you know, I don't know how many spots in the next year maybe a handful But anyway, and we're also looking for a salesy people.

340
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:56,057
Scott: But the point is the sure the big tech companies who hasn't laid people off yet Apple and you know what Apple did do.

341
00:21:56,639 --> 00:22:00,529
Scott: they reduced Tim apples salary at his request.

342
00:22:00,629 --> 00:22:04,502
Scott: now so I mean plenty to criticize in the Apple world.

343
00:22:04,622 --> 00:22:10,739
Scott: clearly, right but Apple by doing that instead of laying people.

344
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:12,202
Rym: so there's reporting today.

345
00:22:12,323 --> 00:22:15,250
Rym: numerous analysts are saying Apple is definitely going to lay people off.

346
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:15,832
Rym: It's just a matter.

347
00:22:15,892 --> 00:22:16,454
Rym: Okay, not.

348
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:21,396
Scott: if well, maybe they will and in which case then yeah I'll see whatever about.

349
00:22:21,618 --> 00:22:25,417
Scott: what I'm about to say is not true that As of now, it is still true.

350
00:22:25,498 --> 00:22:26,019
Rym: These are.

351
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,010
Rym: this is speculation that I've reported on, right?

352
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:43,370
Scott: Let's just say any company that were to not lay people off when its competitors did right that were to say When its competitors were firing that company would be buying into the dip.

353
00:22:43,732 --> 00:22:46,030
Scott: Yeah, right, you would be by that's buying low.

354
00:22:46,191 --> 00:22:50,270
Scott: You're getting these great employees when competition for their labor is weak.

355
00:22:50,641 --> 00:22:51,452
Scott: Yeah Oh price.

356
00:22:51,893 --> 00:23:05,687
Scott: and then when those other companies that laid people off when you get to the next quarter and the next quarter Those companies are not going to be delivering cool Products at their keynote speeches because they didn't have any one doing they were just keeping the lights on.

357
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:06,430
Scott: they didn't have people.

358
00:23:06,771 --> 00:23:08,397
Scott: They cancel all their hot projects.

359
00:23:08,758 --> 00:23:12,190
Scott: So a lot of those projects were gonna miss and fail and probably were a waste of money.

360
00:23:12,331 --> 00:23:15,310
Scott: Yeah, but at least one of them might have been something exciting, right?

361
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:22,423
Scott: So all those companies now not only canceled a bunch of crap good but they also canceled something that might have been a success.

362
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:34,030
Scott: and now those companies are basically Ensuring that they're gonna maintain status quo and not for the near future deliver anything new and amazing That would generate good revenues.

363
00:23:34,051 --> 00:23:44,421
Rym: Yeah I found a chart along these lines does showing that the biggest drop in consumer pennant spending was people in yours and mine Demographic the richer people but not the richest people.

364
00:23:44,501 --> 00:23:48,355
Rym: They are the ones who are cutting their discretionary spending Drastically, right,

365
00:23:48,676 --> 00:24:04,670
Scott: but if you know a company were to not lay people off and were to hire They would I predict right basically suddenly come out and deliver right some Awesome kind of product right that would pull in the customers.

366
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:10,449
Scott: whatever customers are out there right and you know get a big boost while everyone else is asleep.

367
00:24:10,469 --> 00:24:18,121
Rym: and What I was arguing at my job strongly I strongly believe in what you said now is the Apple.

368
00:24:18,322 --> 00:24:24,627
Scott: if if Apple does not lay people off Right because right now they haven't yet to do so at least in this cycle here.

369
00:24:24,647 --> 00:24:25,129
Scott: Yeah, right.

370
00:24:25,911 --> 00:24:30,584
Scott: Then I predict that they will be the company that does exactly that right.

371
00:24:30,624 --> 00:24:41,969
Scott: they will come out right whenever when Microsoft and and everyone else is asleep and like next year or the year after it's gonna be like oh shit Apple's got the hot shit and everyone else has nothing to kill it.

372
00:24:42,993 --> 00:24:44,419
Rym: So we'll see what happens.

373
00:24:44,499 --> 00:24:47,170
Rym: This is uh, there's a lot going on in the US economy.

374
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:54,477
Rym: This is one tiny tiny sliver the other big big news and there's so much to say here But it'll segue into the main bid.

375
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:05,729
Rym: the United States Department of Justice is Basically going as hard as hell against Google to the point that they could if this succeeds break them up over this.

376
00:25:06,495 --> 00:25:11,238
Scott: yep, so just to Focus only on this suit because we're gonna.

377
00:25:11,358 --> 00:25:30,010
Scott: you know, what's happening is it's an antitrust lawsuit Obviously, right similar to the Microsoft one back in the day where they're basically saying Hey, you're a company and you had Monopoly power in one area of business and you used that monopoly power to basically, you know

378
00:25:30,692 --> 00:25:30,953
Rym: Kill

379
00:25:31,053 --> 00:25:39,740
Scott: off competition in other areas of business right in an unfair way And an illegal way according to the laws of the United States.

380
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:43,050
Scott: Yeah, so there's already a suit against Google.

381
00:25:43,451 --> 00:25:51,871
Scott: That's an antitrust suit about search advertising and that is that's an old suit That's been around for years that that's coming to court like later this year I think.

382
00:25:53,034 --> 00:25:55,881
Scott: and that suit is only about search advertising the old one.

383
00:25:56,021 --> 00:26:05,792
Scott: when that search advertising is obviously you do a search on Google Results come up and there's ads mixed in with the search results, right and you're not running adblock Right.

384
00:26:05,832 --> 00:26:06,032
Scott: Sure.

385
00:26:06,654 --> 00:26:11,668
Scott: This new suit the one that's the big big news is not about search advertising.

386
00:26:11,909 --> 00:26:12,330
Scott: Not at all.

387
00:26:12,711 --> 00:26:17,733
Scott: It's about display advertising because this was I'm pretty sure 99% sure.

388
00:26:17,813 --> 00:26:19,258
Scott: it was news on GeekNights.

389
00:26:19,318 --> 00:26:22,870
Scott: when this happened Google bought a company called double-click.

390
00:26:23,341 --> 00:26:30,086
Scott: Yeah Click what double-click was a company that basically had a near monopoly.

391
00:26:30,346 --> 00:26:36,281
Scott: was the the industry leader Technology ad tech for display advertising.

392
00:26:36,341 --> 00:26:37,786
Scott: you are which includes.

393
00:26:38,187 --> 00:26:39,170
Scott: you have a website.

394
00:26:39,692 --> 00:26:40,995
Scott: You put ads on it.

395
00:26:41,697 --> 00:26:44,004
Scott: other people want to buy ads right.

396
00:26:44,245 --> 00:26:49,655
Scott: they go through some convoluted system we're gonna explain in the main bit and They pay money.

397
00:26:49,957 --> 00:26:51,824
Scott: the ad shows up on your website.

398
00:26:52,126 --> 00:26:58,125
Scott: you get money Right and the images videos, you know something that displays on your website.

399
00:26:58,146 --> 00:26:59,570
Scott: That's display advertising.

400
00:27:00,072 --> 00:27:02,280
Scott: Google bye-bye after buying.

401
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:13,010
Scott: when they bought double-click, right the FTC it actually mentions this right said, okay This won't said, you know, they made comments as to why it wouldn't be an antitrust problem.

402
00:27:13,571 --> 00:27:20,210
Scott: Right and in the lawsuit the DOJ filed they said the FTC said this and they were wrong.

403
00:27:20,854 --> 00:27:23,249
Scott: It was a problem and I could have told you that back then.

404
00:27:23,711 --> 00:27:26,380
Scott: So now the smart person is me.

405
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,727
Rym: the cool part about this lawsuit is the.

406
00:27:28,828 --> 00:27:37,900
Rym: the people Within the Department of Justice who are driving it have issued some statements and give them some clarity on Why they're pursuing it in the manner that they're pursuing it.

407
00:27:38,563 --> 00:27:54,338
Rym: and the idea to summarize all these articles you can click and read the actual specific details is They are hoping to set a new precedent for novel kinds of antitrust lawsuits that have previously been ignored or been difficult to Achieve like it's been hard to win.

408
00:27:54,398 --> 00:28:02,770
Rym: This is this is if this succeeds This is gonna be like the big breakup of like JP Morgan oil trust and such back in the day.

409
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:05,600
Rym: Like this would be a new era of trust busting.

410
00:28:05,941 --> 00:28:08,250
Scott: because now I'm not I am NOT a lawyer, right?

411
00:28:08,691 --> 00:28:23,170
Scott: But the evaluations I have seen including reading most of the actual court filing well most of the court filing is actually a Layman's plain English description of how this business works and what Google did in this business.

412
00:28:23,974 --> 00:28:27,290
Rym: Better description than like some sites that explain how ad tech work, right?

413
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:30,390
Scott: Like if you just want to learn how ad tech works just read this thing.

414
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:32,217
Scott: It's like it won't take you really that long.

415
00:28:32,237 --> 00:28:34,385
Scott: you can skip most of it and it's pretty much just like.

416
00:28:34,727 --> 00:28:35,951
Scott: here's how ad tech Works.

417
00:28:36,293 --> 00:28:38,482
Scott: this is what Google did in that part of ad tech.

418
00:28:38,682 --> 00:28:39,767
Scott: This is why it's a crime.

419
00:28:39,948 --> 00:28:43,184
Scott: next part I gotta say is the next part of the ad business.

420
00:28:43,345 --> 00:28:44,270
Rym: reading it, right?

421
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:49,997
Rym: And we'll get into this in the main bit about why I'm about to say it breaks this law and this law Reading this law here and that law there.

422
00:28:50,137 --> 00:28:57,434
Rym: from the perspective of someone who is an expert in capital markets and has been in that industry for a long time It is.

423
00:28:58,038 --> 00:29:08,017
Rym: it is so egregious and Obviously right for abuse what Google was doing and honestly what all digital ad not just Google But all online ads with very few exceptions.

424
00:29:08,178 --> 00:29:18,420
Rym: I go like this is shit that capital markets and like stock exchanges Regulated over a hundred years ago because it was so obviously Like it's ripe for corruption.

425
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,230
Scott: Well, I'm gonna go further than that, right?

426
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:25,230
Scott: I think what's happened is we have the the internet and computers, right?

427
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:30,389
Scott: Yeah have allowed people to create digital market places of any kind.

428
00:29:31,473 --> 00:29:34,300
Scott: Anyone could just make a digital market right.

429
00:29:34,361 --> 00:29:37,750
Scott: seam has fucking cards and money and skins going around right?

430
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:42,550
Scott: It's like just anyone with no government interference or regulation whatsoever.

431
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:57,583
Rym: Yeah If I want to make a market to sell like I got to comply with a million regulations If I remember market that sells pictures of Scott my drew, you know, there are markets that involve, you know The things that the SEC regulates at least in the US.

432
00:29:57,664 --> 00:29:59,610
Scott: other countries have their own equivalents, right?

433
00:30:00,577 --> 00:30:02,210
Scott: fight real financial markets.

434
00:30:02,832 --> 00:30:13,110
Scott: Every if anyone else who just makes a market of any kind anywhere Right is completely unregulated until the government of the place where the market is a point of order.

435
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:16,630
Rym: But making a market is actually a technical term for something very specific.

436
00:30:17,531 --> 00:30:18,293
Rym: They create.

437
00:30:18,313 --> 00:30:19,999
Scott: you talk about market makers at the stock.

438
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:25,658
Rym: Yeah making markets is a thing that can happen within Markets, I'm talking building a marketplace.

439
00:30:25,678 --> 00:30:29,690
Scott: like you're in civilization and you go to your city and like what do I build next?

440
00:30:30,152 --> 00:30:33,209
Scott: Marketplace, I need another trade route that kind of building a market.

441
00:30:35,772 --> 00:30:38,084
Scott: So, but yet any and that's we've seen it with crypto.

442
00:30:38,205 --> 00:30:44,034
Scott: we've seen it with skins With advertising specifically as an example.

443
00:30:44,436 --> 00:30:55,408
Rym: you are making a market about a thing where the only Evidence you can give the person buying your thing is evidence you create about the effectiveness of that thing.

444
00:30:55,709 --> 00:31:01,870
Rym: You're selling Their ways anyway, yeah, I mean there are ways to try to independently verify which we'll get into in the main bit.

445
00:31:01,991 --> 00:31:22,708
Rym: But you're basically selling an asset that you control In a manner that is not regulated and can be very opaque to the person buying and the people buying Kind of have a vested interest in not necessarily knowing how effective or how like well It's working because of the weird incentives of this kind of market.

446
00:31:23,511 --> 00:31:26,862
Scott: So based on my personal assessment this case right.

447
00:31:27,042 --> 00:31:30,495
Scott: the reason it might fail is because This has been.

448
00:31:30,515 --> 00:31:31,740
Scott: this is a very difficult cut.

449
00:31:31,761 --> 00:31:33,629
Scott: like Rym said it's a difficult kind of thing to do.

450
00:31:34,072 --> 00:31:39,060
Scott: People don't haven't tried it since like AT&T Microsoft Times right and it's just.

451
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,088
Scott: it's like they're trying to go up a big hill.

452
00:31:41,288 --> 00:31:49,050
Scott: However The the case that they have brought is basically the strongest conceivable case, right?

453
00:31:49,150 --> 00:32:02,709
Scott: It's like if you're gonna try to go up that mountain with any company under any anti-competitive circumstance if they wanted to go after NBC Comcast or Verizon or any giant monopoly ish company that probably should be broken up, right?

454
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:06,037
Scott: Sinclair with all its broadcasting shit.

455
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:08,064
Scott: They own everywhere like that.

456
00:32:08,786 --> 00:32:13,963
Scott: This one is Probably not eat the strongest case they could bring I guess.

457
00:32:14,164 --> 00:32:15,910
Scott: so it's like I feel like that a real.

458
00:32:16,771 --> 00:32:17,494
Scott: That's what they did.

459
00:32:17,534 --> 00:32:19,904
Scott: is they looked at all the monopolies they would like to destroy.

460
00:32:20,045 --> 00:32:23,423
Scott: it's hard to go after an Case we have against any of them.

461
00:32:23,544 --> 00:32:24,490
Scott: is the Google ad one.

462
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:26,697
Scott: let's do that one and the case that they have brought.

463
00:32:27,158 --> 00:32:33,101
Scott: if it wasn't for their a history of this being difficult to do in My non lawyer opinion.

464
00:32:33,141 --> 00:32:33,868
Scott: This would be a shoo-in.

465
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:36,820
Rym: Yeah, and it's partly because it is hard to go after.

466
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:39,450
Rym: monopolies in general like the laws are not great in the US.

467
00:32:39,611 --> 00:32:50,160
Rym: Yeah in the US but also even when you can prove something as a monopoly You often have to go further and prove either malfeasance or harm Directly caused by it's not.

468
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,590
Scott: it's not a crime to be a monopoly in the US.

469
00:32:52,711 --> 00:32:59,363
Scott: It's only a crime to like engage in certain specific anti-competitive behaviors Like Microsoft.

470
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:02,090
Scott: what they got in trouble for was not have it.

471
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:06,310
Scott: You know owning Microsoft Windows which had monopoly at the time on desktop computers.

472
00:33:06,792 --> 00:33:20,828
Scott: The the reason they had a trouble back then is because they tried to use their monopoly power to stifle competition for web browsers and force IE To be the standard and destroy everyone else and that was using their monopoly power for evil.

473
00:33:20,848 --> 00:33:31,129
Scott: So Google used its control of Advertising and search to push other ad companies, you know out and and diminish them.

474
00:33:31,731 --> 00:33:37,846
Rym: Never mind the implications that Google may have engaged in fraudulent behavior in the course of many many fraudulent.

475
00:33:37,866 --> 00:33:38,427
Scott: Oh, no, I'm.

476
00:33:39,229 --> 00:33:42,829
Rym: I mean I'm speaking like someone doesn't want to get sued.

477
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:48,074
Rym: That's to all hell.

478
00:33:48,896 --> 00:33:56,489
Scott: I am personally confident that everything written in that case is true that I've seen much of it with my own eyeballs.

479
00:33:57,053 --> 00:34:00,370
Rym: So if you wonder like what the impact of this could be I should.

480
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:02,876
Scott: Crimes the crimes Google did them.

481
00:34:03,137 --> 00:34:08,070
Rym: Google makes the majority of its income from the advertising.

482
00:34:08,251 --> 00:34:11,501
Rym: Nothing, Google makes makes fucking money except the ads.

483
00:34:11,742 --> 00:34:14,270
Rym: the ads are it Google's not even Android phones.

484
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:15,495
Scott: I don't think those make any money.

485
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:16,197
Rym: It makes money.

486
00:34:16,438 --> 00:34:19,070
Rym: That's a separate problem, but it is no worthy.

487
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:27,428
Rym: I think Google's in deep shit, too Because they have not announced any features or updates from the their ads team since November 17th last year.

488
00:34:28,875 --> 00:34:36,650
Rym: They just went radio silent in public Mmm, and the ad industry like the companies that like talk about and like interact in the ad space.

489
00:34:37,292 --> 00:34:43,110
Rym: They're all like really scared of this because this isn't just gonna put the scrutiny on Google and what they did.

490
00:34:43,591 --> 00:34:52,121
Rym: This is putting scrutiny on the like the marketplaces of ads as a fundamental concept And I think there's a lot of graft in that industry a lot of grift.

491
00:34:52,864 --> 00:34:53,647
Scott: You mean all of it?

492
00:34:53,847 --> 00:34:58,769
Scott: Yeah We'll do some things of the day and we'll talk about how that industry works.

493
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:03,506
Rym: things of the day.

494
00:35:03,607 --> 00:35:07,762
Rym: so Lack of Daisy was a webcomic that I saw off and on.

495
00:35:07,782 --> 00:35:09,067
Rym: I didn't realize it started like.

496
00:35:09,167 --> 00:35:11,384
Scott: I never read it But I knew it existed.

497
00:35:11,404 --> 00:35:17,310
Rym: it started in 2006 and the art got way better over time, but it was pretty good even the beginning.

498
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:32,606
Rym: Take like black sad like that kind of setting and that kind of art but make it a little cuter and a little more animally and don't have the thing where the girl animals are Hot in one way and the guy animals are like very radically differently drawn.

499
00:35:32,746 --> 00:35:36,229
Rym: like it doesn't have that problem But it's very reminiscent of black sad.

500
00:35:37,251 --> 00:35:38,575
Scott: It's a little bit black sad.

501
00:35:38,675 --> 00:35:42,105
Scott: It's a little bit rescuers and a little bit untouchables, right?

502
00:35:42,145 --> 00:35:47,255
Rym: You know, so lack of Daisy is getting an Animated short.

503
00:35:47,917 --> 00:35:51,270
Scott: and when I saw this trailer, I was like, is this a whole movie?

504
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:52,637
Scott: Where the fuck did the money come from?

505
00:35:52,657 --> 00:35:57,230
Scott: Yes, and they're like it's a short and I'm like, oh, okay This trailer looks fucking great.

506
00:35:57,371 --> 00:36:00,965
Rym: This would even to make a short like this because it was a 90-minute.

507
00:36:01,145 --> 00:36:06,240
Scott: if this was a full-length Animated motion picture it would cost tens of millions of time.

508
00:36:08,476 --> 00:36:10,309
Scott: But then it was like, oh it's a short, okay Yep.

509
00:36:10,611 --> 00:36:17,724
Rym: So this trailer is my thing of the day because one I'm watching this the second it comes out and two I started reading the Webcomic, it's pretty good.

510
00:36:17,744 --> 00:36:21,531
Rym: I Slept on this one webcomic that came out in 2006.

511
00:36:21,531 --> 00:36:22,193
Rym: That's great.

512
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:25,725
Rym: that has cool animal people doing gangster stuff in the 20s that I didn't read.

513
00:36:25,745 --> 00:36:26,709
Rym: what the fuck's wrong with me?

514
00:36:28,031 --> 00:36:31,110
Rym: You're just not interneting enough, you know, no, I saw it all the time.

515
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,608
Rym: I just never read it cuz I'm busy and read another crap.

516
00:36:34,611 --> 00:36:36,399
Rym: Maybe I read it now because I stopped reading Twitter.

517
00:36:37,162 --> 00:36:46,250
Scott: Yeah, so I think I think this you know Anything that's coming from the smaller indie places is gonna get more visibility on the indie web and we're gonna see even less mainstream shit.

518
00:36:47,573 --> 00:36:49,778
Rym: I look forward to this but this looks great.

519
00:36:49,818 --> 00:36:50,921
Rym: The voice acting sounds great.

520
00:36:50,961 --> 00:36:51,923
Rym: The animation looks great.

521
00:36:51,964 --> 00:36:53,086
Rym: Everything about this is great.

522
00:36:53,688 --> 00:36:56,258
Scott: Yeah, so There was a song.

523
00:36:56,499 --> 00:36:58,730
Scott: Rym knows this song because it was in Dance Dance Revolution.

524
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:01,398
Scott: That was a big hit song in Japan long ago.

525
00:37:01,418 --> 00:37:06,866
Scott: It's called dancing hero parentheses eat you up by Okonomo.

526
00:37:10,096 --> 00:37:16,773
Scott: You know, I just danced that song yesterday Right, so that song there was a a few years back Right.

527
00:37:17,659 --> 00:37:37,273
Scott: There was a group of five Korean comedian women who parodied covered that song and choreographed a ridiculous awesome High energy dance, right and the name of that group in Korea was Celeb five.

528
00:37:37,394 --> 00:37:39,660
Scott: right and it's funny because they lost a member.

529
00:37:40,021 --> 00:37:44,849
Scott: so it's only four people but they're still called celeb five boys for now.

530
00:37:46,144 --> 00:37:49,098
Scott: Yeah So what happened after?

531
00:37:49,138 --> 00:37:50,924
Scott: that is a third.

532
00:37:51,165 --> 00:37:52,129
Scott: there was a person.

533
00:37:52,169 --> 00:37:52,450
Scott: What's this?

534
00:37:52,972 --> 00:37:54,664
Scott: What's his Japanese person's name?

535
00:37:54,684 --> 00:38:01,030
Scott: I keep forgetting Because I only learned about them recently because they're the person in the thing of the day.

536
00:38:01,151 --> 00:38:04,537
Rym: I can't help because the entire Hara Ihara Rica.

537
00:38:04,557 --> 00:38:16,790
Scott: Ihara Rica is a Japanese person who is an actress and she was going to be in a musical production in Japan and then The COVID canceled the musical production.

538
00:38:18,371 --> 00:38:20,721
Scott: So, what did she do with no job?

539
00:38:21,203 --> 00:38:22,649
Scott: She made a YouTube, right?

540
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:25,937
Scott: So her YouTube is like Ihara Rica.

541
00:38:26,117 --> 00:38:30,410
Scott: step and go right and she's got a cute YouTube channel, right and it's popular.

542
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:32,763
Scott: She's got a hundred and thirty four thousand subscribers.

543
00:38:32,783 --> 00:38:33,970
Scott: That's a lot more than we have, right?

544
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:45,870
Scott: yeah, and one of the things she did on her YouTube channel like her top video is She used to be in her earlier days according to the internet like the captain of her high school dance team, right?

545
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:48,674
Scott: So despite being a you know, she's a Broadway actress.

546
00:38:48,714 --> 00:38:50,276
Scott: She's got to have some dancing skills.

547
00:38:50,316 --> 00:38:59,537
Scott: Yeah, she got together a dance crew and They performed the celeb five Cover, huh, right?

Scott: So it's a. it's a cover cover, right?

549
00:39:02,652 --> 00:39:08,708
Scott: But you know being a dance crew and not just being five comedians They did a way better job.

550
00:39:10,191 --> 00:39:17,970
Scott: Right, I went more all-out and extreme and that video is the thing of the day Not too shabby.

551
00:39:19,094 --> 00:39:20,463
Rym: In the meta moment, we're back.

552
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:24,900

00:39:46,937 --> 00:39:50,050
Rym: I got to say Vikram and his sister are the two Vikram?

560
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:50,692

562
00:39:53,443 --> 00:39:55,410
Rym: I love pretty sure it's Vikram not Vikram.

563
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:59,202
Rym: Yeah, I I know a guy who pronounces it like.

564
00:39:59,262 --> 00:40:01,630
Scott: I've no human beings who had that name.

565
00:40:02,592 --> 00:40:04,638
Rym: I know a guy who pronounces it Vikram.

566
00:40:04,959 --> 00:40:06,403
Rym: at work and actually back.

567
00:40:06,423 --> 00:40:15,989
Rym: when I worked at two jobs ago the company I worked for there was a guy who was from Russia But he lived in the US and his name was spelled Ivan IV an but he pronounced it Yvonne.

568
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:17,692
Rym: That was just a personal thing that he did.

569
00:40:20,155 --> 00:40:22,158
Scott: the Google says Vikram.

570
00:40:22,359 --> 00:40:32,280
Rym: Mm-hmm anyway, those two characters are Great, and the best part of the book is a moment when they're in a. I'm trying not to spoil things.

571
00:40:32,584 --> 00:40:37,800
Rym: They're in a weird place Interacting with a weird entity and they're like we don't have any of your weird money.

572
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:43,420
Rym: How do we pay you and what he pays that entity with for his services is?

573
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,540
Rym: That and the little illustrations in the last pages of the book are fantastic.

574
00:40:48,744 --> 00:40:49,820
Rym: All right for it with the iPod.

575
00:40:50,851 --> 00:40:50,977
Scott: Yep.

576
00:40:52,021 --> 00:40:52,705
Rym: So yeah, I'll leave.

577
00:40:52,745 --> 00:40:55,780
Rym: the unseen has been seen and then I get to announce the cut and choose.

581
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:03,474
Rym: I don't know what you'll pick.

582
00:41:04,017 --> 00:41:04,620
Rym: I really don't.

583
00:41:05,581 --> 00:41:08,390
Rym: Anyway, one of the long though that might influence you.

584
00:41:08,912 --> 00:41:10,016
Scott: All right, so let's talk about.

585
00:41:10,056 --> 00:41:15,169
Scott: we talked about in the news Google's being sued for their monopoly on display advertising, right?

586
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:19,180
Scott: How does display advertising on the internet the thing that we all block?

587
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:20,001
Scott: Yep, right.

588
00:41:20,342 --> 00:41:23,191
Scott: Hopefully how does it work when you don't block it?

589
00:41:23,452 --> 00:41:23,653
Scott: Right?

590
00:41:23,994 --> 00:41:30,880
Scott: There's three main pieces Right, there is the publisher side, which is also the sell side.

591
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,149
Rym: I believe right up the people who have.

592
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:35,620
Rym: they publish content and they have space for ads.

593
00:41:36,302 --> 00:41:40,094
Scott: You have a website and you want to put ads on it to make money, right?

594
00:41:40,495 --> 00:41:44,652
Scott: There is the exchange and then there is the buy side.

595
00:41:44,853 --> 00:41:55,479
Scott: you are a Person who has a good or service and you would like to buy ads So that people click on them and come to your website instead of the website They're on and then buy your shit.

596
00:41:55,499 --> 00:42:07,617
Rym: now you might notice buy side and sell side are also terms used in capital markets and just Keep that in the back of your mind for later in this main bit because I got there are some things that are stuck in my craw about ad tech.

597
00:42:09,042 --> 00:42:11,440
Rym: They've been stuck in there for like a decade and they're irrelevant.

598
00:42:13,092 --> 00:42:19,680
Rym: But One thing you have to really disabuse yourself of is the idea that ads are like manually or statically placed anymore.

599
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,442
Rym: That is rare.

600
00:42:20,843 --> 00:42:22,488
Rym: That is like a very different kind.

601
00:42:22,508 --> 00:42:23,170
Scott: It does happen.

602
00:42:23,411 --> 00:42:24,053
Scott: It does happen.

603
00:42:24,073 --> 00:42:25,237
Rym: Yep, but it's rare.

604
00:42:25,257 --> 00:42:25,477
Rym: It's rare.

605
00:42:26,742 --> 00:42:28,229
Rym: It's a different kind of advertising.

606
00:42:28,591 --> 00:42:30,280
Rym: It's usually a lot more expensive.

607
00:42:30,722 --> 00:42:36,487
Rym: it usually involves one-off like direct contracts between Individuals or groups or like it's.

608
00:42:36,808 --> 00:42:40,760
Rym: it's a very different world from most online advertising, right?

609
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,860
Scott: It usually only takes place with very very big websites.

610
00:42:44,101 --> 00:42:50,217
Rym: They would do that even back when they're like early ad exchanges were forming penny arcades website.

611
00:42:50,237 --> 00:42:56,697
Rym: when there was an ad there They had a direct agreement with like a game publisher to do a custom ad on their site for them.

612
00:42:56,717 --> 00:43:12,420
Scott: one-off Yep, or you'd be like, okay, you know someone we are you know, we are such-and-such newspaper and you know Such-and-such person is like gonna be our you know ad partner our official sponsor or whatever, right?

613
00:43:12,843 --> 00:43:14,131
Scott: So we have to run their ads.

614
00:43:14,191 --> 00:43:15,077
Scott: we can't just be we're not.

615
00:43:15,097 --> 00:43:15,218
Scott: just.

616
00:43:15,238 --> 00:43:20,300
Scott: you know If you're just got a blog and you want to make some money, it's like you're just running whatever ads, right?

617
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:20,561
Scott: It's like.

618
00:43:20,581 --> 00:43:24,917
Scott: you're not, you know making individual deals like, you know, it's like when you go.

619
00:43:25,017 --> 00:43:28,440
Scott: why on YouTube These aren't display ads on YouTube their sponsorships.

620
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:36,674
Scott: But and you see like all these people running ads for Nord VPN Not all those people didn't like go to Nord VPN and make signed contracts with them.

621
00:43:37,035 --> 00:43:41,890
Scott: Nord VPN has like a thing on their website You could just sign up for yeah, right and just start running.

622
00:43:42,071 --> 00:43:45,904
Scott: just start promoting them and then they send you money like the affiliate Deals, right?

623
00:43:45,964 --> 00:43:46,947
Scott: It's like it's all automated.

624
00:43:46,967 --> 00:43:50,439
Scott: There's no yeah caught, you know hand-to-hand shake things going on.

625
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:57,034
Rym: And when there is a hand hand a handshake situation That is like the organic ad read in the middle of the podcast.

626
00:43:57,054 --> 00:43:58,520
Rym: you listen to it the YouTube video you watch.

627
00:43:58,981 --> 00:44:04,240
Rym: Obviously there isn't an automated exchange that's inserting a natural ad read into a podcast usually.

628
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:09,817
Scott: But let's say somebody does buy ads specifically like on a website.

629
00:44:09,917 --> 00:44:18,719
Scott: in that case the Ad the technology behind how the ads work is still the same except the exchange part is bypassed.

630
00:44:19,622 --> 00:44:21,268
Scott: Yeah, you basically skip the exchange.

631
00:44:21,308 --> 00:44:27,774
Scott: There's still the buy side in the sell side running the same software But they just talk to each other directly, right?

632
00:44:27,835 --> 00:44:28,819
Scott: It's like, you know.

633
00:44:30,144 --> 00:44:31,377
Scott: So here's how it works, right?

634
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:40,549
Scott: Somebody it all begins when you without your ad blocker like a fool Visit a website with an ad on it, right.

635
00:44:41,411 --> 00:44:43,819
Scott: and now what happens is that website goes?

636
00:44:43,879 --> 00:44:45,948
Scott: Oh shit I'm running some JavaScript.

637
00:44:46,269 --> 00:44:46,551
Scott: I want to.

638
00:44:46,711 --> 00:44:48,520
Scott: I want to put an ad here and make some fucking money.

639
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:49,081
Scott: Yeah, right.

640
00:44:49,521 --> 00:45:02,010
Scott: and they run a piece of software and that piece of software used to be called and is sometimes still called double click for publishers And is the new name of it is Google Ad Manager.

641
00:45:02,611 --> 00:45:05,961
Scott: and this application right has a Monopoly.

642
00:45:06,242 --> 00:45:13,140
Scott: right you can choose to use another piece of software other than this to a to host your ads on your website.

643
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,384
Rym: Probably a bad idea.

644
00:45:15,227 --> 00:45:46,678
Scott: if you do so if you choose to use something else besides Google Ad Manager Then the only ads that will be bidding right in the auction to be the to be the ad that's gonna show up right are going to be ads from other exchanges and other weird places that aren't Google which means All of the people who are buying ads on the other side, right if people are buying ads with Google Adsense Right, you know Google products, right?

645
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:48,784
Scott: Basically those people are.

646
00:45:48,824 --> 00:45:53,920
Scott: it's like you're running an auction house, right and a lot of people just won't show up to your auction.

647
00:45:54,181 --> 00:45:55,065
Scott: Yeah, they're Google people.

648
00:45:55,668 --> 00:46:07,947
Rym: if you want Google people to show up at your auction Then you have to use the Google product and because they own basically the entire industry if you're if they don't show up to your auction You're gonna get the lowest bidders.

649
00:46:08,007 --> 00:46:09,152
Rym: It's gonna be all penis pills.

650
00:46:09,834 --> 00:46:11,280
Scott: So what does this software look like?

651
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:12,725
Scott: Well, it's pretty straightforward, right?

652
00:46:12,805 --> 00:46:13,869
Scott: It's you're like you go into it.

653
00:46:13,889 --> 00:46:16,920
Scott: You're like new ad, you know on my home page, right?

654
00:46:17,081 --> 00:46:17,905
Scott: It's this big.

655
00:46:18,005 --> 00:46:20,820
Scott: I want it to be images videos, you know.

656
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:22,899
Scott: It's that you can figure what the ads gonna look like.

657
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,869
Scott: It gives you the embed codes right.

658
00:46:24,909 --> 00:46:32,420
Scott: you copy and paste the embed codes into your website And you can figure like how much you know, what's how much are you willing to sell the ad for right?

659
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:35,474
Scott: It's like well if no one's willing, you know 50 cents minimum.

660
00:46:35,515 --> 00:46:40,113
Scott: if no one pays 50 cents I'm not showing anything right or I'll take whatever I can get.

661
00:46:40,213 --> 00:46:44,128
Scott: I don't care right you can figure all that Everything that you need to configure.

662
00:46:44,209 --> 00:46:45,815
Rym: a lot of people a minimum bid.

663
00:46:45,936 --> 00:46:49,848
Rym: they'll show their own Internal advertising or like their own content instead.

664
00:46:50,109 --> 00:46:54,764
Scott: Yep, or you might configure things like, you know, these are the kinds of ads I'm willing to show.

665
00:46:54,784 --> 00:46:55,669
Scott: these are the kinds of ads.

666
00:46:55,689 --> 00:47:06,306
Scott: I'm not willing to show you might configure Hey, so-and-so company bought, you know a sponsorship deal, you know show these ads Specifically from this person.

667
00:47:06,326 --> 00:47:12,431
Scott: right this many times because I made a deal with them Etc all these things you need to configure.

668
00:47:12,532 --> 00:47:14,400
Scott: about ads showing up on a website.

669
00:47:14,983 --> 00:47:24,983
Rym: You can figure in there and there's a bunch of authentication Mechanisms to make sure that like the sources of the ads themselves are on the list of ones You've approved.

670
00:47:25,124 --> 00:47:26,490
Rym: if you do that sign a process.

671
00:47:26,711 --> 00:47:27,715
Rym: There's a lot of it's very.

672
00:47:27,936 --> 00:47:28,820
Scott: it's a very complex.

673
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:40,359
Scott: There's so much configuration that goes on which is also why it's kind of hard to compete because you would have to you know Even if there wasn't a monopoly situation your new product would have to have all the features of this.

674
00:47:40,459 --> 00:47:41,864
Rym: Yeah It's got it.

675
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:42,610
Rym: If nothing else.

676
00:47:42,831 --> 00:47:44,120
Rym: It's got to be perform and think about that.

677
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:58,674
Rym: So it goes to a web page and in the time the web page itself is loading you have to complete an auction That get content from a third party and embed it into your website Like this has to be performant as hell if the ad usually right

678
00:47:58,714 --> 00:48:00,320
Scott: my way ads make your website slow.

679
00:48:01,022 --> 00:48:09,080
Rym: But even that like advertiser people buying ad inventory like wanting to put ads on your website They really want the ad to show up as fast as possible.

680
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:10,124
Rym: They'll be mad if it doesn't.

681
00:48:10,626 --> 00:48:12,232
Scott: it also needs to do other things like.

682
00:48:12,292 --> 00:48:15,184
Scott: it needs to track and sort of count like okay Who saw the ad?

683
00:48:15,204 --> 00:48:16,048
Scott: how long did they see it?

684
00:48:16,089 --> 00:48:16,953
Scott: who clicked on it?

685
00:48:16,993 --> 00:48:18,219
Scott: We know who right?

686
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:20,047
Scott: Did they move their mouse over it?

687
00:48:20,128 --> 00:48:21,194
Scott: It's like how long did they watch?

688
00:48:21,214 --> 00:48:22,219
Scott: did they scroll past it?

689
00:48:22,642 --> 00:48:24,895
Scott: You know, it's um, it's an ad that's below the scroll.

690
00:48:24,915 --> 00:48:25,660
Scott: Did they scroll down?

691
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:28,171
Scott: It's you know, and then it's got to report that information, right?

692
00:48:28,512 --> 00:48:34,041
Scott: Here's how many ads you showed Right, and it's got to report that information back to the people who bought the ads, too Right.

693
00:48:34,061 --> 00:48:36,773
Scott: It's like your ad was seen on this site this many times.

694
00:48:36,834 --> 00:48:43,178
Scott: It was clicked on this many times Right, all these things are encompassed in this one this one product.

695
00:48:43,459 --> 00:48:46,207
Scott: Yep So it's time to show the ad.

696
00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:49,340
Scott: it's decided that it doesn't know what ad to show.

697
00:48:49,882 --> 00:48:54,859
Scott: It's got to go find someone on the internet who's an ad buyer and get to sell them this ad right.

698
00:48:55,401 --> 00:49:03,349
Scott: So it collects as much information as possible about the person Looking at the website, right?

699
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:10,252
Scott: You can't just go and be like, hey, we've got a you know A square shape ad on front row crew comm right?

700
00:49:10,553 --> 00:49:11,998
Rym: It worked that way in like the late 90s.

701
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:13,644
Rym: It doesn't work anymore.

702
00:49:13,986 --> 00:49:15,612
Scott: who wants to buy an ad there?

703
00:49:15,632 --> 00:49:17,640
Scott: and nobody's gonna want that right?

704
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:18,604
Scott: You have to be like.

705
00:49:18,644 --> 00:49:26,554
Scott: look the person who's visiting this web page Without adblock who has clicked on they're using an iPhone.

706
00:49:26,794 --> 00:49:33,485
Scott: they just five seconds ago They were on Amazon and they were looking at skis, right and they're.

707
00:49:33,766 --> 00:49:37,442
Scott: they're on my website now and Right.

708
00:49:37,522 --> 00:49:43,080
Scott: So you get as much information as you possibly can with all the third-party cookies and trackers and all the shit that you're blocking.

709
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:53,627
Scott: Cuz you're smart, right and you put that out there Right, and then you send that to one of the ad exchanges the Google ad exchange And that's where the bidding goes on.

710
00:49:53,668 --> 00:49:57,100
Scott: people see that and they're like, okay, how much is that worth, right?

711
00:49:57,220 --> 00:50:01,717
Scott: Will I bid on that and how much will I bid to have my ad show up there now?

712
00:50:01,737 --> 00:50:07,714
Rym: You might be wondering What if my website just lies about who's looking at it?

713
00:50:07,995 --> 00:50:15,525
Rym: That's part of what this technology Putting a big asterisk here solves Because in the end.

714
00:50:15,545 --> 00:50:27,660
Rym: the person buying the ads has to trust the analytics data They get through these platforms or if they're really big They might have other platforms trying to independently monitor how the ad performance appears.

715
00:50:27,721 --> 00:50:29,353
Scott: That's part of what the exchange does right.

716
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:29,721
Scott: it's like.

717
00:50:29,741 --> 00:50:30,022
Scott: that is.

718
00:50:30,343 --> 00:50:41,729
Scott: your Google ad exchange will like look at the information that the publishing side sends them and If they have more information about that ad, you know viewer Yeah, they will add it in to the information.

719
00:50:41,749 --> 00:50:43,033
Rym: This is the problem.

720
00:50:43,134 --> 00:50:47,065
Rym: This is why I remember the thing about capital markets I said before You can't.

721
00:50:47,105 --> 00:50:52,945
Rym: you can't have a buy side and a sell side and an exchange in the same fucking company In capital markets.

722
00:50:53,266 --> 00:51:00,468
Rym: the entire world agreed over a hundred years ago that that is a terrible idea Because everyone can lie to you and you have no recourse.

723
00:51:00,508 --> 00:51:03,557
Rym: So even though these are ostensibly separate platforms.

724
00:51:03,577 --> 00:51:15,597
Rym: I use Google to put up my spaces where people could buy ads and the person buying ads uses Google to put ads in those places and they also Use Google to tell them how well those ads did.

725
00:51:16,442 --> 00:51:20,600
Scott: Yep, so in this exchange all that's happening is auctions, right?

726
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:25,960
Scott: It's like it's getting things to sell right, you know, imagine an actual auction house, right?

727
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:30,680
Scott: These are these antiquities and antiques are coming from the web, you know.

728
00:51:34,627 --> 00:51:37,260
Scott: Everyone looking at websites is an antique, right?

729
00:51:37,961 --> 00:51:45,147
Scott: And the ad exchange lines up all the antiques and gets as much information about each antique as they can And then brings out the gavel, right?

730
00:51:45,548 --> 00:51:45,829
Scott: Okay.

731
00:51:45,849 --> 00:51:47,193
Scott: So who's who's buying?

732
00:51:47,333 --> 00:51:48,436
Scott: who's coming to the auction?

733
00:51:48,477 --> 00:51:49,600
Rym: Hey, we got a sucker.

734
00:51:50,042 --> 00:51:52,692
Rym: Just spent a ton of money on a ski trip to Vail.

735
00:51:52,933 --> 00:51:54,640
Rym: doesn't have ad block running for some reason.

736
00:51:54,921 --> 00:51:56,447
Rym: He spends all day on Twitter.

737
00:51:56,648 --> 00:51:57,812
Rym: He's looking at Twitter right now.

738
00:51:58,013 --> 00:51:59,940
Rym: who wants to get in front of his fucking eyeballs?

739
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:00,462
Rym: Let's go.

740
00:52:00,482 --> 00:52:02,711
Scott: So this is the buy side software.

741
00:52:02,751 --> 00:52:05,160
Scott: There's two kinds of buy side software, right?

742
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:14,360
Scott: Well, this is really only one kind but in the Google world Google has created, you know Artificially two worlds in terms of buy side.

743
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:20,940
Scott: Yeah, the one world that they've created is basically like the the automatic like Google ad.

744
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:30,145
Scott: I forget what the actual name of it is But it's basically like if you just go to google.com and you try to buy ads using like Adsense or whatever the hell it is Called now, right?

745
00:52:30,506 --> 00:52:39,260
Scott: It's like basically that is like this very You know diminished and opaque and not very powerful system.

746
00:52:40,363 --> 00:52:42,054
Scott: It gives you very limited options.

747
00:52:42,194 --> 00:52:51,693
Rym: I've used it professionally at my last company because I was in charge of marketing and I gotta say Opaque is a very diplomatic way of putting it.

748
00:52:52,055 --> 00:52:53,583
Rym: It doesn't tell you fuck it Is it just thing?

749
00:52:53,663 --> 00:52:55,071
Scott: is it just called Google ads?

750
00:52:55,594 --> 00:52:56,519
Scott: I forget what it's called them.

751
00:52:57,502 --> 00:52:59,958
Rym: Like it not all the worst thing is using it.

752
00:53:00,641 --> 00:53:07,140
Rym: It would keep making recommendations on how to do things better, but those recommendations always just meant spending more money for some reason.

753
00:53:08,841 --> 00:53:13,780
Scott: Yeah, no basically that Oh Google it's just called Google ads, you know advertise, right.

754
00:53:14,242 --> 00:53:21,539
Scott: So yeah, the thing that's just called Google ads now I don't know what it used to be called which has 80% market share by the way, right?

755
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:30,680
Scott: It's basically you go in and you put in here's my ads right and you can figure Where you would like your ads to be seen.

756
00:53:30,841 --> 00:53:34,738
Scott: I want them to be seen by nerds and people who are searching for this.

757
00:53:35,501 --> 00:53:40,520
Scott: Even if it wasn't, you know, even though they're not search ads, that's still information that they might know, right?

758
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:41,803
Scott: Someone was recently searching.

759
00:53:42,325 --> 00:53:45,935
Scott: someone who was recently looking at you know, this website or that website?

760
00:53:46,317 --> 00:53:49,264
Scott: someone in this demographic Someone on these.

761
00:53:49,284 --> 00:53:56,028
Scott: I want to advertise on these websites and this is how much I'm willing to pay at most For all of these different kinds of ads.

762
00:53:56,088 --> 00:54:03,456
Scott: if it's a you know a YouTube ad, you know and it's for on a nerdy GeekNights video, I'm willing to pay a dollar.

763
00:54:03,516 --> 00:54:06,227
Scott: if it's on a Nazi video no money.

764
00:54:06,428 --> 00:54:09,199
Scott: Well all that all this configuration goes on there.

765
00:54:11,252 --> 00:54:25,406
Scott: and But the Google ads product which is what most people have to use right because they're not fancy rich giant companies Right, you just have to use that one because that's like the only thing you can reasonably use Being just a small-time deal right?

766
00:54:25,446 --> 00:54:29,919
Scott: all those like Instagram ads you see from like small companies are all using this thing, right?

767
00:54:31,401 --> 00:54:34,653
Scott: That's like you don't have a lot of configuration options right there.

768
00:54:34,773 --> 00:54:46,552
Scott: it's like you could imagine a lot more and once you set it up, it just goes and it goes to the auction house and It bids for you, right?

769
00:54:46,814 --> 00:54:50,891
Scott: You can't possibly Conceivably sit there and review all the bids.

770
00:54:51,111 --> 00:54:53,620
Scott: Yeah, it's like it's way too fast for that.

771
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:54,479
Scott: There's too many websites.

772
00:54:55,884 --> 00:55:00,740
Rym: You go to some dodgy pirate site to watch a hockey game and there's a thousand ads on that website.

773
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:04,280
Rym: How do you know your ad isn't showing up one of those fucking things, right?

774
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:10,837
Scott: So but the point is it's like you get reports back of like where your ad showed up and how much money you got back And all that sort of thing, right?

775
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:19,151
Scott: But you know, it's like you don't really have Real complete control over and you don't know what's happening, right?

776
00:55:19,191 --> 00:55:22,120
Scott: So what's happening here is that you've got an auction house, right?

777
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:25,730
Scott: You got multiple auction houses, but the biggest one is the Google one, right?

778
00:55:26,111 --> 00:55:28,177
Scott: You're using this product, right?

779
00:55:28,899 --> 00:55:35,991
Scott: And You know if people want to show your ads Right because 80% of people are using this product.

780
00:55:36,432 --> 00:55:39,280
Scott: They have to use the Google Exchange, right?

781
00:55:39,842 --> 00:55:44,566
Scott: It's not gonna make bids out anywhere else because it's the Google one.

782
00:55:44,807 --> 00:55:46,213
Scott: so you have an auction house being run.

783
00:55:46,253 --> 00:55:50,660
Scott: the person holding the gavel is Google and Everyone bidding is also Google.

784
00:55:50,821 --> 00:55:55,639
Scott: They're all bidding on behalf of someone else who isn't Google, but all the seats are filled by Google.

785
00:55:56,101 --> 00:56:04,978
Rym: Literally everything we've described is regulated out of existence in capital markets Even in very dubiously regulated countries like this is babies.

786
00:56:05,079 --> 00:56:11,219
Scott: first Only thing you know about how your money that you put in like, okay Here's a hundred dollars go buy ads.

787
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:20,349
Scott: the only way like the only thing you know about how that hundred dollars got spent is basically it's like What Google decided to do is like

788
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:29,899
Rym: give a kid a hundred bucks and say hey go tell people in town about my product And the kid comes back and he spent the hundred dollars is gone and he tells you yeah I told a million people and they all thought it was great.

789
00:56:30,822 --> 00:56:35,043
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know, so That's the right.

790
00:56:35,083 --> 00:56:48,537
Scott: So there's a second part of the buy side and this is also a Google product right called Google display and video 360, right which Has like 40% market share, right so it's not as dominant.

791
00:56:49,099 --> 00:56:52,811
Scott: but This is what you use if you're a big deal, right.

792
00:56:53,132 --> 00:57:03,920
Scott: if you're like a big fortune 500 company And you've got a marketing department buying internet display ads They're not using Google ads like every other little, you know, tiny company out there, right?

793
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:14,080
Scott: They're using this thing and this thing actually lets you configure Frickin everything right like, you know buying ads directly from someone betting on bidding on other exchanges.

794
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:19,239
Scott: It's basically like the professional the pro version of the Google ads, right?

795
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:25,200
Scott: But it's still run by Google and it still does evil stuff that you didn't realize.

796
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:30,159
Rym: I mean in the end you're still reliant on the person you bought the ad space from to tell you how well it went.

797
00:57:31,241 --> 00:57:45,360
Scott: Well, the only the way you can tell is that if someone's not blocking ads, yeah, right then what's happening with display ads At least in the simplest cases Let's say a JPEG is that the JPEG is hosted on your domain, right?

798
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:59,897
Scott: So at the very least you can verify that an HTTP request is made to that JPEG From the browser that also requested the website because the JPEG isn't hosted by the person who's hosting the website It's hosted by you the advertiser.

799
00:58:00,098 --> 00:58:05,520
Rym: now I might have a scam website that redirects that request through another proxy.

800
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:11,387
Rym: I may have an ad block that loads the ad but doesn't show it to me Sure, but I mean regard.

801
00:58:11,668 --> 00:58:18,500
Scott: while those kinds of frauds do exist and there's a battle around it It's like there's a lot of people with phones out there who don't block any ads.

802
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:22,800
Scott: Yeah, we're seeing everything and that's you know, it's still a large number of ads being seen.

803
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:23,663
Scott: Why are they effective?

804
00:58:24,045 --> 00:58:24,567
Scott: we could discuss.

805
00:58:24,587 --> 00:58:25,792
Scott: we've discussed that in the past.

806
00:58:25,933 --> 00:58:27,600
Scott: Yeah, are they worth what you're paying for them?

807
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:31,295
Scott: Who knows right, but that's how this works, right?

808
00:58:31,336 --> 00:58:35,369
Scott: So This this auction happens right.

809
00:58:35,569 --> 00:58:38,818
Scott: the auction used to be back in the day.

810
00:58:38,838 --> 00:58:42,448
Scott: a Second price wins auction.

811
00:58:42,528 --> 00:58:46,739
Scott: So basically what happens is everyone bids or how much they're willing to pay for the ad.

812
00:58:47,462 --> 00:58:51,336
Scott: Whoever bids the most obviously their ad is the one that's gonna get shown right?

813
00:58:51,457 --> 00:58:52,541
Scott: I'm gonna pay $100.

814
00:58:52,541 --> 00:58:54,332
Scott: No one else is gonna pay even $1.

815
00:58:54,332 --> 00:58:55,500
Scott: Mm-hmm, right?

816
00:58:55,961 --> 00:59:00,176
Scott: But the price you actually pay isn't the number you bid.

817
00:59:00,257 --> 00:59:01,180
Scott: I bid a million dollars.

818
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:02,265
Scott: I want my ad to be shown.

819
00:59:02,285 --> 00:59:02,968
Scott: All right.

820
00:59:02,988 --> 00:59:04,395
Scott: Well Rym bid the second highest.

821
00:59:04,435 --> 00:59:05,440
Scott: he bid a dollar.

822
00:59:05,881 --> 00:59:11,017
Scott: So you bid a million but we're only gonna charge you a dollar and one cent you pay this.

823
00:59:11,077 --> 00:59:11,740
Scott: is that higher?

824
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:19,760
Rym: This is a sensibly more fair because it's an opaque market in that you can set sort of your maximum price.

825
00:59:20,241 --> 00:59:25,339
Rym: But if you're the only game if like you're the only one in town, they're not just gonna milk all that money out of you.

826
00:59:25,803 --> 00:59:32,780
Scott: Theoretically Nope, so yeah, so it used to be a second price bid deal, right?

827
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:37,317
Scott: Whereas now they've somewhat recently switched it to just first place.

828
00:59:37,377 --> 00:59:38,100
Scott: wins, right?

829
00:59:38,341 --> 00:59:45,367
Scott: And when it was second price wins, they were doing shenanigans putting in Extra higher bids.

830
00:59:45,869 --> 00:59:55,780
Rym: right because I remember when I was running this for my old company We kept getting credits from Google where they'd be like, hey, here's 500 extra bucks just to spend on advertising.

831
00:59:56,881 --> 01:00:03,560
Rym: So, of course if I put extra money in Google basically paid me to put in added ad buys.

832
01:00:04,024 --> 01:00:06,963
Rym: That would raise the bid price Right.

833
01:00:06,983 --> 01:00:07,325
Scott: So what?

834
01:00:07,527 --> 01:00:12,780
Scott: yeah, so the other thing that happens is like, okay So let's say I put out, you know, I go make some bids, right?

835
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:24,032
Scott: let's say an ad cut someone visits a website right and That person trying to sell the space tries to sell it on the Google ad exchange and They also try to sell it on some other exchange.

836
01:00:24,213 --> 01:00:32,025
Scott: that isn't the Google ad exchange Mmm, and I'm trying to buy ads and I'm not using the Google ads I'm using the something real.

837
01:00:32,266 --> 01:00:43,500
Scott: and I'm looking at multiple exchanges to try to buy ads and I see The same ad spot show up on two different auction houses, right which can happen, right?

838
01:00:43,781 --> 01:00:47,040
Scott: It's not like an antique that can only be in one auction house at a time.

839
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:52,139
Scott: It's like you got Sotheby's and you got Christie's and they're both auctioning the same Van Gogh.

840
01:00:52,440 --> 01:01:10,611
Scott: Yeah at the same time, right and you're looking at the prices coming in from both and the people in the two auction houses don't realize they're competing with each other unless the people in both auction houses are Google because one auction house is run by Google and The person bidding for you in the Google auction house is Google.

841
01:01:10,832 --> 01:01:16,249
Scott: You see how this could person bidding Person bidding in the non Google auction house.

842
01:01:16,891 --> 01:01:17,111
Scott: Yeah.

843
01:01:17,192 --> 01:01:21,646
Scott: Okay, Google isn't running the other auction house But they're bidding in the other auction house.

844
01:01:21,686 --> 01:01:26,624
Scott: So what happens is Google was putting in an Extra bid.

845
01:01:27,368 --> 01:01:29,560
Scott: the same ad was in two different auction houses.

846
01:01:30,042 --> 01:01:35,100
Scott: Google would put an extra bid in that was high in their auction house, right?

847
01:01:35,702 --> 01:01:36,359
Scott: Making it right.

848
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:39,580
Scott: So now what happens is the Google auction house?

849
01:01:40,302 --> 01:01:46,420
Scott: Ends up being the place where the winning bid is all the time, right?

850
01:01:47,562 --> 01:01:54,760
Scott: So it's like oh, I'm selling I'm trying to sell my stuff and all these auction houses But the Google auction house always has the highest bids and keeps winning all the time.

851
01:01:55,102 --> 01:01:57,680
Scott: That's where the big big bidders are, right?

852
01:01:58,181 --> 01:02:05,714
Scott: And so I have to sell there if I'm an ad space seller Right and they're using that monopoly power to increment.

853
01:02:05,734 --> 01:02:14,324
Rym: So Now this is sort of the the thing that I. this is pure speculation, but I wonder very strongly What's going to happen?

854
01:02:14,364 --> 01:02:24,559
Rym: Let's say Google gets broken up and like they actually separate all these different like Stages of the ad world into different companies that can't collude with each other.

855
01:02:25,301 --> 01:02:34,904
Rym: It is possible the money exchanged in advertising will drop like a rock because it's possible that it's all inflated by Google's shenanigans Mm-hmm.

856
01:02:35,186 --> 01:02:35,891
Rym: It is also pie.

857
01:02:35,911 --> 01:02:40,069
Rym: It's possible that Advertising as a bubble might collapse as a result of this.

858
01:02:40,410 --> 01:02:45,020
Rym: It's possible that Google literally can't make money with anything It does accept the advertising.

859
01:02:45,742 --> 01:02:47,327
Scott: Well, there's a few things that will happen.

860
01:02:47,387 --> 01:02:51,620
Scott: First of all, right Google and every step all three steps.

861
01:02:52,204 --> 01:02:55,324
Scott: Google is extracting fees Right.

862
01:02:55,825 --> 01:03:05,940
Scott: So if there is no longer if there's a competitive marketplace There will be competitive pressure for the provider of each of the three services with the lowest fees.

863
01:03:06,342 --> 01:03:07,971
Rym: Yeah, just like capital markets.

864
01:03:07,991 --> 01:03:09,620
Rym: There's a concept of best execution.

865
01:03:10,062 --> 01:03:14,960
Rym: You cannot just charge someone more to trade a stock if they could have gotten it cheaper elsewhere.

866
01:03:15,141 --> 01:03:30,320
Rym: like you can get in trouble if if I take orders from Scott and Scott's paying me a fee for me to trade and then I trade them on My friend Joey Jojo's exchange instead of the nicey because Joey Jojo will give me a better commission rate.

867
01:03:30,844 --> 01:03:31,448
Rym: That's illegal.

868
01:03:31,488 --> 01:03:32,959
Rym: That is like literally illegal.

869
01:03:35,482 --> 01:03:36,245
Scott: I realized something.

870
01:03:36,586 --> 01:03:36,706
Scott: Uh-huh.

871
01:03:37,369 --> 01:03:39,095
Scott: I did not press record.

872
01:03:39,115 --> 01:03:40,360
Rym: I have the backup.

873
01:03:40,481 --> 01:03:48,015
Rym: It just means that the audio on this episode of GeekNights It's going to be what Scott sounds like through the discord and not Scott's real voice.

874
01:03:48,216 --> 01:03:57,800
Rym: I pushed record just now My voice may suddenly change, you know, it's Monday so this is a good opportunity, uh, you know, normally this you'd hear the ad read was like speaking of.

875
01:03:58,882 --> 01:04:01,458
Rym: This is why you have redundant fucking systems and backups.

876
01:04:01,499 --> 01:04:05,934
Rym: kids Like I have so many backups of Scott's voice in case something like that happens.

877
01:04:05,974 --> 01:04:06,697
Rym: That's why GeekNights.

878
01:04:06,717 --> 01:04:09,059
Rym: So rarely fucks up anyway.

879
01:04:11,741 --> 01:04:15,353
Scott: We didn't do I guess cuz of the hiatus we didn't actually say oh, let's push record.

880
01:04:15,674 --> 01:04:17,300
Rym: I did say let's push record.

881
01:04:17,902 --> 01:04:18,403
Scott: I don't remember.

882
01:04:18,604 --> 01:04:20,369
Rym: Anyway, I didn't listen for your hack.

883
01:04:20,469 --> 01:04:21,291
Rym: That's the other problem.

884
01:04:22,094 --> 01:04:23,457
Scott: Anyway, I pushed it now.

885
01:04:24,099 --> 01:04:26,484
Scott: So The last bit.

886
01:04:26,545 --> 01:04:30,100
Scott: All right, so the people who were selling ad space, right?

887
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:38,940
Scott: Have somewhat recently the past few years is what I mean by recently, right tried to do this thing called a header bidding, right?

888
01:04:41,001 --> 01:04:46,860
Scott: So what header bidding is is basically been them trying to get out from under Google's thumb, right?

889
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:55,759
Scott: Basically, they're putting they're trying to run the auction right in the header of the website technologically speaking.

890
01:04:56,427 --> 01:05:09,820
Scott: hmm, so Basically, you know trying to get this auction done quickly before the rest of the website loads super fast and getting prices from a Lot bids from a lot of sources, right?

891
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:17,546
Scott: You know instead of where before what they used to do is they would do a waterfall kind of situation where they would say Hey you what's your bid?

892
01:05:17,888 --> 01:05:19,355
Scott: and then they would go if they didn't like that.

893
01:05:19,435 --> 01:05:21,084
Scott: if the bid was good enough They'd go with it.

894
01:05:21,425 --> 01:05:24,099
Scott: and then you go to the second person and they say what's your bid?

895
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:29,076
Scott: Right until they found a bid they liked and at the very bottom was Google, right?

896
01:05:29,417 --> 01:05:36,308
Scott: And if they it's like, okay we couldn't find anyone else who is buying this ad and We didn't sell the ad directly to someone.

897
01:05:36,750 --> 01:05:39,580
Scott: So at the last case we're gonna ask Google, right?

898
01:05:39,961 --> 01:05:44,460
Scott: And because they had this waterfall system Google knew how this waterfall system worked.

899
01:05:44,781 --> 01:05:51,406
Scott: They manipulated it and even though they were at the bottom they could still get you to the bottom a lot Right and win.

900
01:05:51,949 --> 01:05:57,326
Scott: So the header bidding is basically trying to get Simultaneous bids from everybody, right?

901
01:05:57,627 --> 01:06:03,544
Scott: It's like instead of going from one to the next to the next until you find a number you like It's just hey everybody.

902
01:06:03,685 --> 01:06:04,347
Scott: What will you pay?

903
01:06:04,527 --> 01:06:08,720
Scott: all the numbers come back and then in the header of the website?

904
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:14,285
Scott: It's like which ad was gonna pay the most run that one And then you know you can.

905
01:06:14,606 --> 01:06:20,667
Scott: we can't sit here to explain it all but Google tried to stop that - Google's was like man, this is gonna ruin us.

906
01:06:21,129 --> 01:06:22,534
Scott: and they tried to put an end to it.

907
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:25,366
Scott: And it's like on the one hand.

908
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:32,558
Scott: It's like yeah, that was anti-competitive and bad But on the other hand they were fucking over people who were doing ads so I don't have that much sympathy.

909
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:35,435
Scott: Yeah, it's like the whole thing is like all this stuff.

910
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:44,634
Scott: Right when you read about what Google did and it's like you imagine yourself in the shoes of like the ad buyer getting ripped off Or the ad seller getting ripped off, but I hate.

911
01:06:44,694 --> 01:06:45,760
Rym: I hate the ad buyers.

912
01:06:46,061 --> 01:06:47,790
Rym: I hate the ad buyers with a passion already.

913
01:06:47,851 --> 01:06:48,152
Rym: I hate.

914
01:06:48,172 --> 01:06:49,640
Scott: I hate all three of these people.

915
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:55,480
Rym: It's like ad buyers are subsidizing all the technology that people use adblock run, right?

916
01:06:55,620 --> 01:06:55,861
Scott: It's like.

917
01:06:56,403 --> 01:07:03,715
Scott: so it's like oh, so it's like I don't really care if all these people who get fucked over This is just like a popcorn situation here, right?

918
01:07:03,755 --> 01:07:04,720
Scott: That's what you got to remember.

919
01:07:05,262 --> 01:07:11,733
Scott: But you know if you think ad buying and selling is okay Well, then yeah the ad people.

920
01:07:11,774 --> 01:07:27,160
Scott: they got done dirty By how all this works and they had to do and that's why ads Technologically keep ruining websites because they have to keep doing more and more shenanigans Like the header bidding to get the websites to you know to get the money, right?

921
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:28,729
Scott: They if they just but if they so.

922
01:07:28,769 --> 01:07:41,540
Scott: it was to make a website with like nice behaving ads right like just a JPEG that loads it doesn't track you and You know doesn't do anything shady and doesn't make the website load slow

923
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:49,480
Rym: Like if I got a hundred dollars for my jpeg to show up on his page Every time anyone loads it for a month like that is very simple and straightforward

924
01:07:50,062 --> 01:07:54,436
Scott: Right, if you try to do ads like that the good way you won't make any freaking money.

925
01:07:54,476 --> 01:07:55,540
Scott: There's no auctions happening.

926
01:07:55,701 --> 01:07:57,712
Scott: You're gonna know not know get the right prices.

927
01:07:57,733 --> 01:07:59,000
Scott: They're not gonna right.

928
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:10,360
Scott: It's like if you want to get more money You have to double this tracking and that way when you put your thing in the auction house It looks really good and the right buyer can find it and bid highly for it.

929
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:10,761
Scott: right?

930
01:08:11,042 --> 01:08:23,160
Scott: and you have to make your website load a little bit slower so you can take a few extra milliseconds to get bids from More places and you have to show video ads because someone will pay more for those and so on and so on and so forth.

931
01:08:24,140 --> 01:08:25,550
Rym: So what do you do?

932
01:08:25,671 --> 01:08:26,636
Rym: Cuz we've gone on long.

933
01:08:26,678 --> 01:08:27,040
Rym: this happens.

934
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:28,645
Scott: I like all ads everywhere always.

935
01:08:28,747 --> 01:08:39,680
Scott: I've always run ad block block all ads no matter what because Just in computers and talking about in your entire life Anywhere, there are ads in your life anywhere billboards.

936
01:08:40,041 --> 01:08:41,947
Scott: It's like there's only so much you can do.

937
01:08:42,488 --> 01:08:51,059
Scott: but do what you can do find a way to You know blot them out of your life as much as possible, right and to.

938
01:08:52,183 --> 01:09:06,270
Rym: if you try to read about what we talked about you're gonna see a lot of really really Jargony nonsense because the ad tech world uses its own language to describe everything We just described like DSPs and SSPs and all these different set.

939
01:09:06,291 --> 01:09:08,116
Scott: here is the link to the justice.

940
01:09:08,216 --> 01:09:10,223
Scott: the US Justice Department Just read that.

941
01:09:10,283 --> 01:09:11,227
Rym: it explains everything.

942
01:09:11,308 --> 01:09:14,420
Scott: It's on our website for our crew calm which has no ads on it.

943
01:09:14,662 --> 01:09:16,219
Scott: I even remove Google Analytics from it.

944
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:23,935
Scott: Yeah, right if you scroll to the bottom of the page, I linked right on the page You're gonna see a diagram that shows what we explained.

945
01:09:23,975 --> 01:09:31,477
Scott: but at the bottom It'll say attachments download complaint, right if you click download complaint, you're gonna get this PDF.

946
01:09:31,957 --> 01:09:34,265
Scott: that is How long is this thing?

947
01:09:34,886 --> 01:09:35,469
Scott: It's pretty long.

948
01:09:35,550 --> 01:09:45,196
Rym: Yeah, but the way I describe it is this kind of document remember 155 page PDF, but it is very plain English very comprehensive.

949
01:09:45,236 --> 01:09:46,740
Rym: I think this is a legal document.

950
01:09:46,881 --> 01:09:52,487
Rym: So basically this has to convince like a judge and a bunch of people For a jury a jury trial, right?

951
01:09:54,580 --> 01:09:59,579
Scott: So a jury is gonna read this and have to decide, you know, whether Google is guilty or not.

952
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:01,584
Scott: It's some day.

953
01:10:01,645 --> 01:10:05,280
Scott: Hopefully right if there's not some sort of settlement or who knows what they're gonna do, right?

954
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:08,231
Rym: but your innovation is that the DOJ will not accept a settle.

955
01:10:08,251 --> 01:10:15,371
Rym: they issued a statement to the effect of Promises of better future behavior and fines rarely achieve the desired results.

956
01:10:15,591 --> 01:10:19,360
Rym: We are seeking a full breakup as the sole remedy.

957
01:10:19,922 --> 01:10:25,340
Scott: Well here we can be at the very bottom in section 9. request for relief to remedy these illegal acts.

958
01:10:25,481 --> 01:10:30,043
Scott: plaintiffs request that the court a judge and decree that Google has violated this law.

959
01:10:30,063 --> 01:10:32,069
Scott: a judge and decree Google is violated.

960
01:10:32,430 --> 01:10:35,598
Scott: attempted to mob monopolize in violation of the Sherman Act.

961
01:10:36,059 --> 01:10:41,507
Scott: a Judge sure that they have broken other part of the Sherman Act Award damages order.

962
01:10:41,547 --> 01:11:05,760
Scott: the divestiture of at minimum the Google ad manager suite Including both Google's publisher ad server and Google's ad exchange along with any additional structural relief as needed I'll share a head of harm and join Google from continuing to engage in the anti-competitive practices described here in Enter any other relief necessary to restore competitive conditions in the markets of ad buying and selling.

963
01:11:06,503 --> 01:11:07,912
Scott: I'm paraphrasing.

964
01:11:07,992 --> 01:11:08,173
Scott: Yep.

965
01:11:08,616 --> 01:11:18,700
Scott: I think this is Or finds dropper and Award the plaintiffs as applicable an amount equal to cost attorneys fees and the the plaintiffs.

966
01:11:18,841 --> 01:11:20,890
Scott: I isn't just the US Department of Justice.

967
01:11:21,272 --> 01:11:28,938
Scott: It's also several states including California where Google is, yeah, New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Tennessee, etc, etc.

968
01:11:29,761 --> 01:11:30,665
Scott: So it's like you could see.

969
01:11:30,745 --> 01:11:34,260
Scott: that's like anyone can understand that if you're literate in the English language, right?

970
01:11:35,221 --> 01:11:43,880
Scott: Yeah, the whole big it the table of contents is just like how ad tech tools work how ad tech intermediaries get paid how publishers and advertisers select ad tech tools.

971
01:11:44,462 --> 01:11:46,710
Scott: Google's scheme to dominate the ad tech stock.

972
01:11:46,770 --> 01:11:57,400
Scott: and it's like Google in here They allege in my opinion correctly Google was actually making less money than it could have made in order to squelch competition.

973
01:11:57,500 --> 01:12:10,056
Scott: Right if Google had done, I guess the right thing which is I guess the second best right thing The best thing being not having ads that the second best thing of running running these networks legitimately.

974
01:12:10,357 --> 01:12:11,400
Scott: They would have made more money.

975
01:12:12,881 --> 01:12:19,940
Scott: Right, they were giving up revenues in order to destroy competitors for the long-term play, which is the illegal part.

976
01:12:25,684 --> 01:12:28,220
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
