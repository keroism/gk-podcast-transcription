1
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,377
Rym: It's Tuesday, May 30th, 2023.

2
00:00:08,377 --> 00:00:08,578
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,395 --> 00:00:12,930
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:14,755
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:19,510
Rym: Tonight, we are talking about The Legend of Zelda, Tears of the Kingdom.

6
00:00:21,391 --> 00:00:22,408
Scott: Let's do this!

7
00:00:24,474 --> 00:00:26,470
Rym: So yeah, we're back after an unplanned hiatus.

8
00:00:27,651 --> 00:00:30,279
Rym: So it wasn't COVID, but I got it.

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,750
Rym: Emily also got a ridiculous bacterial sinus infection.

10
00:00:33,931 --> 00:00:35,275
Rym: I took a whole week off work.

11
00:00:35,495 --> 00:00:40,250
Rym: Plus, that was the sickest I have been in over a decade.

12
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:41,405
Rym: That was the worst.

13
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,969
Scott: You seem to get very sick, you know, every so often.

14
00:00:45,471 --> 00:00:46,274
Rym: Yeah, I get sick.

15
00:00:46,314 --> 00:00:52,549
Rym: Pre-COVID times, I feel like my average being sick for a few days, like actually sick, is about twice a year.

16
00:00:52,911 --> 00:00:54,099
Rym: I tend to get sick in the spring.

17
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:55,610
Rym: I tend to get sick in the fall.

18
00:00:56,571 --> 00:01:00,870
Rym: But during the COVID times, I really didn't get sick at all, except when we caught COVID once.

19
00:01:01,592 --> 00:01:06,990
Scott: But there have been some times where you've been like way sick, like sicker than I've ever been.

20
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,750
Scott: Like food poisoning time.

21
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:11,949
Rym: Oh, I mean food poisoning, I don't count, because that's a different kind of thing.

22
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:18,630
Rym: But in terms of like sinus infection like this, I haven't had a sickness like this in a long, long time.

23
00:01:18,731 --> 00:01:19,789
Rym: Usually it's just like a cold.

24
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:25,086
Rym: But this was like a bacterial, take antibiotics, for real sinus infection.

25
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:26,230
Rym: I had to go to the doctor for.

26
00:01:27,112 --> 00:01:33,110
Rym: And it felt the worst of any sickness I have had in at least 10 years.

27
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:39,570
Scott: I mean, when I was in, I don't know how old I was, but I was definitely still in school, right?

28
00:01:40,353 --> 00:01:41,430
Scott: Pre-college school.

29
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:52,050
Scott: And I had, the doctor said I had pneumonia and gave me antibiotics, but it didn't feel worse than any other kind of coughing sickness I had ever had.

30
00:01:53,014 --> 00:01:54,969
Scott: But I stayed home for a whole week and I was happy about that.

31
00:01:55,211 --> 00:01:55,411
Rym: Yup.

32
00:01:55,993 --> 00:02:00,430
Rym: The worst part was, this wasn't a "stay home" but really you're playing video games.

33
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,650
Rym: It was a "stay home and you don't want to play video games", which is the worst.

34
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:08,929
Rym: You want to be sick enough to not have to work, but not so sick that you can't play video games.

35
00:02:09,351 --> 00:02:11,570
Rym: That's like the sweet spot, especially as a kid.

36
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,045
Rym: But yeah, we're back.

37
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:18,360
Rym: I don't anticipate any significant disruptions in GeekNights for a while yet.

38
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,220
Rym: Even though it's summer and we're doing stuff, that stuff doesn't seem to super overlap with GeekNights.

39
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,259
Rym: And we're going to be kind of mostly back to normal, I guess.

40
00:02:28,121 --> 00:02:32,820
Rym: There's so much gaming news that there's no way we can catch up on everything, but a few selections.

41
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:49,200
Rym: I got one little news about Overwatch 2, which, while I still like that game, it is still very apparent that the fact that it is free to play has caused every problem this game has, and none of those problems existed in Overwatch 1, even though they're basically the same game.

42
00:02:49,782 --> 00:02:55,480
Rym: It's like a case study in how toxic free-to-play as a concept is to games, just in general.

43
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:06,839
Rym: But Overwatch, Blizzard, they have announced and they've shared details about the banning situation, like when they permanently ban accounts and how they deal with that.

44
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:26,939
Rym: And what they revealed is that since they launched Overwatch 2, they have permanently banned over 100,000 verified accounts, which appears to be, based on the numbers I was able to dig up from before, more bans than the entire history of Overwatch 1 combined, which makes sense if it's a free-to-play game now.

45
00:03:28,401 --> 00:03:29,183
Rym: There's more people.

46
00:03:29,544 --> 00:03:34,380
Rym: You don't need to spend 20 bucks to get into the game to get banned and spend 20 more bucks.

47
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:38,680
Rym: All you need is a phone number and you can make a new Overwatch account.

48
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:44,020
Rym: There's nothing they can do to stop you, other than checking your phone number to see if it's been banned before.

49
00:03:44,602 --> 00:03:55,380
Rym: But this seems to be accelerating because they said that currently, they're banning well more than 5,000 people a week just for attempting to cheat.

50
00:03:55,881 --> 00:04:02,559
Rym: Not even counting the people who are banned for harassment, or banned for smurfing, or banned for all the other things people might do.

51
00:04:02,961 --> 00:04:06,500
Rym: This is just people who are trying to cheat using hacks.

52
00:04:08,701 --> 00:04:17,981
Rym: And it's just, what really fascinates me is how literally none of these things were problems in Overwatch 1.

53
00:04:17,981 --> 00:04:37,900
Rym: Like, nobody cheated because you were out cash if you got caught cheating, and they aggressively banned people, but once the barrier to entry was just have a phone number, which they even had to go soft on because a lot of people had phone numbers from dubious websites that they banned for a while, but then a lot of poor people also used those websites, so they unbanned those carriers.

54
00:04:38,921 --> 00:04:42,480
Rym: Those quote carriers, they're basically websites that give you dubious phone numbers.

55
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:56,040
Rym: It's just a whole shit show, but it's only getting worse, and it seems like this is going to be a permanent problem for Overwatch because it's free to play, and I have no advice for this company other than you shouldn't have made your game free to play.

56
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:04,699
Scott: I think there is a way to do it, is that if you want to have some sort of... The problem is that you get people playing for zero dollars, right?

57
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:09,580
Scott: And it's interfering with people who are playing seriously, competitively.

58
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:15,740
Scott: And of course, we did a whole panel about how the competitive and the casual can't coexist in terms of game design, right?

59
00:05:16,061 --> 00:05:24,699
Scott: The design of the game itself can't accommodate both players, but what you could do in terms of this sort of meta structure around the game...

60
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,560
Rym: Pay to be in the real competitive ladder.

61
00:05:27,301 --> 00:05:27,764
Scott: Exactly.

62
00:05:27,824 --> 00:05:30,400
Scott: There could be the free to play mode.

63
00:05:31,182 --> 00:05:37,840
Scott: If you don't pay, you can do all this shit that doesn't actually matter, and Overwatch to your heart's content...

64
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,940
Rym: Play in quick play, even play in a ranked whatever.

65
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,340
Rym: It's just you will not be playing with the people who pay dollars.

66
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:43,522
Scott: Exactly.

67
00:05:43,562 --> 00:05:45,560
Scott: And then it's like, just do a segregate.

68
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:52,300
Scott: The thing is, I think the reason companies don't want to do that is because you'll basically get this segregate.

69
00:05:52,380 --> 00:06:15,613
Scott: You'll split your audience, and if your audience isn't big enough, if there's not enough players total, and a whole bunch of them are playing the serious mode because they paid money, and then the people who don't pay anything might end up being in a ghost town, or vice versa, no one's going to pay because they're just happy playing for free, and the competitive people end up playing in a ghost town because there's no one else.

70
00:06:16,315 --> 00:06:17,820
Scott: that's serious who's going to pay money.

71
00:06:18,361 --> 00:06:31,980
Rym: But here, specifically, there is almost no disincentive to people who want to cheat in competitive modes to try, because the consequences of getting caught and banned are negligible as long as you can get another phone number.

72
00:06:35,223 --> 00:06:38,100
Rym: In some other news, Street Fighter 6 actually came out.

73
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:43,700
Rym: We have not played it, but you may recall, and the reason I'm bringing this up is that Street Fighter 6...

74
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,810
Scott: I didn't even play Street Fighter 5.

75
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:45,980
Scott: I played Street Fighter 4.

76
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:52,480
Rym: I also bought Street Fighter 4, and you know what, recently I sold my old fight stick, because I don't really play fighting games anymore.

77
00:06:52,762 --> 00:06:53,599
Rym: I let that ship sail.

78
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,454
Scott: I still have it, but I haven't used it.

79
00:06:55,514 --> 00:06:55,776
Scott: It's dusty.

80
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:01,700
Rym: Emily actually sold it for quite a bit of money, because it was a special edition one, because I didn't care, that's just the one I bought.

81
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:09,180
Rym: But it's old enough and fancy enough, and we even still had the box, that sweaty nerds were willing to pay a lot for that thing.

82
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:12,359
Scott: Oh, I do not have the box or anything, but it works, and it is...

83
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:18,800
Rym: Mine was in mint condition, because I used it for a few months, and then I stopped playing Street Fighter, because I'm not good at Street Fighter, and I don't like Street Fighter.

84
00:07:21,623 --> 00:07:28,797
Rym: But, if you may recall, when Street Fighter 6 was announced, there was a... I'm not even going to dignify this with the word "controversy".

85
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:40,240
Rym: There was a small, but extremely vocal minority of extremely angry, sweaty nerds on the internet, who were freaking out that it is ruining Street Fighter.

86
00:07:40,801 --> 00:07:52,120
Rym: And what they were freaking out about is extra funny, and I'm linking to this article, because a lot of what this article, which is a review of Street Fighter 6, talks about, is the thing that that set of people was mad about.

87
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,088
Rym: Street Fighter 6 has three control schemes now.

88
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:59,075
Rym: Well, I guess four if you count, just make your own control scheme.

89
00:07:59,296 --> 00:08:01,060
Rym: Like, you could just map things however you want.

90
00:08:01,601 --> 00:08:05,047
Rym: But, control scheme number one is regular ol' Street Fighter.

91
00:08:05,308 --> 00:08:09,335
Rym: You got three different severities of the two different kinds of attacks.

92
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:12,080
Rym: You know, the typical six button configuration Street Fighter.

93
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:22,480
Rym: Then you've got the mode where it's still mostly that, except there are also buttons just set to do the special move, like Hadouken buttons.

94
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,649
Scott: So more than six buttons?

95
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,900
Scott: You gotta find more buttons somewhere?

96
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,800
Rym: Yep, and it consolidates a little bit.

97
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,172
Scott: So if you have a fight stick, you don't have these extra buttons.

98
00:08:30,815 --> 00:08:31,557
Scott: Is it like start?

99
00:08:31,718 --> 00:08:32,200
Scott: that does it?

100
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:38,600
Rym: So I don't want to try to explain it, because without diagrams, it's actually kind of hard to explain in words.

101
00:08:39,001 --> 00:08:43,059
Rym: But if you go to this article, it actually shows screenshots and examples of how this works.

102
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:55,740
Rym: But it's basically like the mid-tier mode, which is actually the mode that makes me interested in trying Street Fighter again, in a way that I have not been able to play a game like Street Fighter for a long time.

103
00:08:56,482 --> 00:09:01,680
Rym: But they call this mode modern control type, which is why the nerds were mad.

104
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:12,440
Rym: Because that implied that classic is eventually going to go away or be sidelined, and modern is what the company- Until it goes away, don't be mad.

105
00:09:12,901 --> 00:09:17,980
Rym: Yeah, I mean, kids, if you're mad about this, think about me and my inverted controls.

106
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:18,482
Rym: Guess what?

107
00:09:18,602 --> 00:09:20,993
Rym: Every single fucking game still has an inverted mode.

108
00:09:21,174 --> 00:09:22,359
Rym: It's not a problem.

109
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,949
Scott: I mean, don't give me- I don't take any slippery slope arguments from anyone.

110
00:09:26,989 --> 00:09:35,707
Scott: If you think that we shouldn't do something because slippery slope, that's just the first step to it being- Oh, but if we ban Nazis, what if they ban everyone?

111
00:09:35,767 --> 00:09:38,152
Rym: It's like, well, did they ban anyone but Nazis yet?

112
00:09:38,653 --> 00:09:39,916
Rym: Is there any indication they're going to?

113
00:09:39,936 --> 00:09:41,580
Rym: Call me when they ban someone else.

114
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,361
Rym: That's right.

115
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:48,770
Scott: If the step that is being taken is not a bad step in itself, take that step.

116
00:09:49,151 --> 00:09:55,460
Scott: If then another step is taken that is a bad step, I would say don't take that bad step, only take good steps.

117
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,846
Scott: Slippery slope can only be used- Get the slippery slopes out of here.

118
00:09:58,907 --> 00:10:01,278
Scott: As long as the step being taken is good, take it.

119
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:04,264
Rym: Slippery slope is an argument that is only used to show a pattern.

120
00:10:04,364 --> 00:10:10,973
Rym: For example, Disney re-upping Mickey Mouse shit every time it came up so many times in a row.

121
00:10:11,433 --> 00:10:16,440
Rym: That is a slippery slope because the slope is a trajectory you can use as an argument.

122
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,650
Scott: But the first step was a bad step.

123
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:18,720
Scott: I would have stopped doing the first step.

124
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,875
Rym: Yeah, I mean, the first step was a bad step, but that was just- that was a slope.

125
00:10:22,056 --> 00:10:22,880
Rym: It was a bad slope.

126
00:10:24,861 --> 00:10:41,340
Scott: It's just, you know, but that's- slippery slope specifically means that, yes, somebody wants to do a thing and make a change that is in a general direction that lead- you know, if a more extreme change were taken, that would be bad.

127
00:10:42,021 --> 00:10:53,240
Scott: And you don't- they want to avoid taking this less extreme beginning change because then it might make that later change more palatable and more possible, right, than it is currently.

128
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,355
Scott: It's like, we don't want to do this good thing because it's in a bad direction.

129
00:10:58,496 --> 00:10:59,499
Scott: It's like, don't care about that.

130
00:11:00,881 --> 00:11:05,565
Rym: So, and then there's a third mode that they call dynamic control type.

131
00:11:06,046 --> 00:11:08,168
Rym: And the article calls it button mashing mode.

132
00:11:08,548 --> 00:11:10,590
Rym: And it's actually pretty cool.

133
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,853
Rym: Like, I kind of want to poke at it just to see how it feels.

134
00:11:14,153 --> 00:11:18,277
Rym: But basically, in this mode, you've only got a few buttons.

135
00:11:18,717 --> 00:11:21,420
Rym: You've got basically three kinds of attacks.

136
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,459
Scott: Punch, kick, and special move or something like that?

137
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:28,184
Rym: So, just attack number one, attack number two, attack number three.

138
00:11:28,464 --> 00:11:34,131
Rym: And if you hit one of those buttons, your character will do whatever fucking attack.

139
00:11:34,171 --> 00:11:42,020
Rym: the game thing makes sense based on where you are, where the opponent is, what you're doing, what the opponent's doing, whether or not you're in the air.

140
00:11:42,481 --> 00:11:44,965
Rym: And the three different buttons are just kind of per character.

141
00:11:45,385 --> 00:11:49,552
Rym: So you can kind of control what each character does broadly.

142
00:11:50,013 --> 00:11:51,395
Rym: But that's it.

143
00:11:51,536 --> 00:11:52,898
Rym: It's just mash buttons.

144
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:54,080
Rym: It'll kind of just work.

145
00:11:55,721 --> 00:12:00,567
Scott: So, yeah, I mean, obviously, you know, pro fighting game people are mad, right?

146
00:12:00,607 --> 00:12:03,691
Scott: Because they have that sort of narrow minded attitude.

147
00:12:03,732 --> 00:12:08,277
Scott: But like, look, no tournament is going to let people use two and three.

148
00:12:08,618 --> 00:12:10,220
Scott: And it's not even clear.

149
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,480
Rym: No tournament they care about will use modes two and three.

150
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,021
Scott: Sure.

151
00:12:14,502 --> 00:12:16,386
Scott: Also, two and three.

152
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:23,200
Scott: Even if someone was allowed to use two or three, they'd probably lose to someone who was good using one.

153
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:23,500
Scott: Yeah.

154
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,982
Scott: Like, look, say we're fencing.

155
00:12:25,043 --> 00:12:26,224
Rym: I'm a mediocre fencer.

156
00:12:26,264 --> 00:12:27,246
Rym: Like, I know the basics.

157
00:12:27,306 --> 00:12:28,107
Rym: I'm okay at it.

158
00:12:28,568 --> 00:12:33,415
Rym: Imagine if you let me just cheat and have a sword that's like 50% longer.

159
00:12:33,435 --> 00:12:35,719
Rym: An Olympian is still going to kick the shit out of me.

160
00:12:35,739 --> 00:12:36,640
Rym: Like, it's not going to matter.

161
00:12:37,361 --> 00:12:37,521
Scott: Right.

162
00:12:37,561 --> 00:12:41,946
Scott: There's some kid out there who just got old enough to start playing this kind of game.

163
00:12:42,126 --> 00:12:42,406
Scott: Right.

164
00:12:42,606 --> 00:12:55,600
Scott: And might it's possible that they might either a, you know, be able to play it and enjoy it more because it's easier than if one was the only mode, in which case they might play it once and give up on it.

165
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:56,401
Scott: Right.

166
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:57,702
Scott: And that may pass.

167
00:12:57,802 --> 00:13:02,247
Scott: I think at least one kid out there will become a fighting game kid and move away.

168
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:05,591
Scott: Start with the mode three or two and move to one at least one kid.

169
00:13:05,711 --> 00:13:05,972
Scott: Right.

170
00:13:06,372 --> 00:13:13,400
Scott: It's like how many people are going to give up on fighting games and say this is garbage because of mode two.

171
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:13,780
Scott: Yeah.

172
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,324
Rym: So many sports are have to worry about.

173
00:13:16,444 --> 00:13:18,847
Rym: how do you keep a pipeline of new talent coming in?

174
00:13:19,187 --> 00:13:22,091
Rym: and fighting games have a big barrier to entry.

175
00:13:22,131 --> 00:13:29,300
Scott: So if you it's like, does the does the existence of tee ball and little league with only six innings hurt baseball?

176
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,344
Rym: Is pickleball destroying tennis?

177
00:13:31,364 --> 00:13:31,985
Rym: No, it doesn't.

178
00:13:32,005 --> 00:13:33,227
Rym: No, pickleball is not destroying tennis.

179
00:13:33,287 --> 00:13:39,619
Scott: There are some tennis people who are sweating, who are like, you know, I heard like John McEnroe like insulting pickleball even though he was playing it for money.

180
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:39,940
Scott: Yeah.

181
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:49,432
Rym: I mean, I guess what I'd say about pickleball is that it if I had to describe it, I'm not saying this negatively, but I'm saying it the way it is.

182
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:52,957
Rym: It is tennis with no athleticism required whatsoever.

183
00:13:53,798 --> 00:13:54,799
Scott: I mean, that's sort of the point.

184
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:55,480
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

185
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,481
Rym: That's what it is.

186
00:13:56,521 --> 00:14:00,326
Rym: But anyone who's mad that that's what it is, is mad about something else.

187
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:06,434
Scott: But the point is, it's like it doesn't hurt the existence of tennis for another.

188
00:14:06,714 --> 00:14:11,340
Scott: In fact, I go further with control scheme one for two and three to exist.

189
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:16,245
Scott: Now, if they got rid of control scheme one, right, then I would go.

190
00:14:16,345 --> 00:14:19,268
Scott: I would say, oh, that is a bad step, right?

191
00:14:19,288 --> 00:14:20,890
Scott: You're ruining the competitive scene.

192
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:21,771
Scott: Don't take that step.

193
00:14:21,831 --> 00:14:22,351
Scott: Well, what?

194
00:14:22,631 --> 00:14:25,154
Scott: But adding two and three is not a bad step.

195
00:14:25,214 --> 00:14:30,960
Rym: What if everyone who starts playing Street Fighter prefers the modern scheme because it's more fun?

196
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:44,772
Rym: And that scene grows bigger than the classic scene, which again, I say is not a problem because the kinds of sweaty people who would still care, even if their mode did actually get minimized or disappear over time.

197
00:14:45,793 --> 00:14:53,060
Rym: Every gaming convention on Earth still has a GameCube Smash Brothers tournament somehow.

198
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,120
Scott: Right.

199
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,002
Scott: Well, that's that's exactly right.

200
00:14:56,022 --> 00:14:57,783
Scott: So first of all, if that were to happen.

201
00:14:58,003 --> 00:14:58,244
Scott: Right.

202
00:14:58,284 --> 00:15:04,348
Scott: Well, the people who really like the old harder way, all Street Fighter one through six still exist.

203
00:15:04,409 --> 00:15:05,970
Scott: If Street Fighter seven doesn't include it.

204
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:06,550
Scott: Right.

205
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:10,153
Scott: Or, you know, if people or if it does include it, but no tournaments are using it.

206
00:15:10,273 --> 00:15:13,556
Scott: It's like, well, you can still play those old games if you want to.

207
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:14,216
Scott: Right.

208
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:14,937
Scott: You can still.

209
00:15:15,057 --> 00:15:18,880
Scott: there'll still be more people like you alive who are still playing the old way.

210
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:23,183
Scott: And also, like you just said, Smash Brothers, modern control scheme.

211
00:15:23,463 --> 00:15:23,703
Scott: Right.

212
00:15:23,863 --> 00:15:30,668
Scott: Even though when you think about it compared to, you know, the classic Street Fighter control scheme, it seems like baby mode.

213
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,389
Rym: Oh, it's a lot like Smash Brothers.

214
00:15:32,409 --> 00:15:39,254
Scott: If you look at the day, it's a lot like Smash Brothers, which is a serious and difficult competitive fighting game with a high skill cap.

215
00:15:39,274 --> 00:15:40,875
Scott: So it's like, is it really?

216
00:15:41,215 --> 00:15:42,156
Scott: three is a baby mode.

217
00:15:42,356 --> 00:15:42,676
Scott: Right.

218
00:15:42,977 --> 00:15:44,758
Scott: But is two really a baby mode?

219
00:15:44,838 --> 00:15:47,760
Scott: It's really just more like Smash Brothers, except it's Street Fighter.

220
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:52,043
Scott: So I don't know if two is really a problem for a competitor.

221
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:54,605
Scott: I think there could be viable competitive.

222
00:15:54,785 --> 00:15:58,167
Scott: It would be different, clearly a different game than control scheme one.

223
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:02,691
Scott: But I think it's perfectly viable as a skill based competitive scene.

224
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:11,937
Rym: And I would argue further based on control scheme, too, if that became a bigger competitive scene, like there were just more people doing it, then that's a good thing.

225
00:16:12,257 --> 00:16:16,060
Rym: If it's popular, it's good in this type of context.

226
00:16:16,681 --> 00:16:29,035
Scott: Now, the problem is, is that Street Fighter as I don't know all the details of it, but from my awareness of what was going on with five and presumably six, there's all sorts of, you know, evil money making shit.

227
00:16:29,075 --> 00:16:29,195
Scott: Right.

228
00:16:29,235 --> 00:16:33,860
Scott: Not only does the game cost 60 bucks, but there's all sorts of DLCs and cosmetic.

229
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:37,043
Rym: There's so much crap in the menu of Street Fighter six.

230
00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:40,125
Scott: It's all trying to get it's all trying to steal your money.

231
00:16:40,205 --> 00:16:41,166
Scott: It's like what it looks like.

232
00:16:41,206 --> 00:16:42,087
Scott: for those reasons.

233
00:16:42,147 --> 00:16:45,350
Scott: I might be avoiding the menus in Street Fighter six.

234
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:52,015
Rym: Like if you click on options or try to do anything, look a lot like Fortnite, which is a bad direction.

235
00:16:52,355 --> 00:16:53,356
Rym: Fortnite's a great game.

236
00:16:53,696 --> 00:16:57,940
Rym: Fortnite's menus are the exact same kind of toxic nonsense that you just described.

237
00:16:59,201 --> 00:17:03,630
Scott: So, yeah, I'm sure someone else can give you all the actual information about that.

238
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:08,680
Scott: But yeah, you know, I don't think you're 60 bucks is going to get you all the street fighting.

239
00:17:11,362 --> 00:17:13,405
Rym: Yeah, 60 bucks just gets me ruined, Ken.

240
00:17:13,545 --> 00:17:16,348
Scott: Like, I don't know what it's going to get you.

241
00:17:16,509 --> 00:17:17,951
Rym: I can't tell what it gets you.

242
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:19,193
Rym: Yeah.

243
00:17:19,854 --> 00:17:23,980
Rym: So one last little news, because we can't cover everything, but I feel like this has to be talked about.

244
00:17:25,681 --> 00:17:31,374
Rym: So Wizards of the Coast called the fucking Pinkertons to raid a kid's house.

245
00:17:31,414 --> 00:17:32,697
Scott: This is an old news already.

246
00:17:32,717 --> 00:17:33,900
Scott: We've just been away for so long.

247
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:42,440
Rym: Because he had magic cards that weren't officially out yet, possibly not even directly on purpose.

248
00:17:43,383 --> 00:17:48,579
Scott: So I mean, I think the name Pinkerton has a long history going back a long ass time.

249
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:50,482
Rym: There's a few progressions.

250
00:17:50,522 --> 00:17:51,945
Rym: You first might think Pinkertons.

251
00:17:52,425 --> 00:17:54,409
Rym: I remember those from social studies class.

252
00:17:54,649 --> 00:17:59,938
Rym: Weren't they the guys who were like cudgeling railroad strikers to death outside of factories?

253
00:18:00,078 --> 00:18:00,940
Rym: And the answer is yes.

254
00:18:02,242 --> 00:18:04,925
Rym: Or weren't those like Wild West violent people?

255
00:18:05,106 --> 00:18:05,406
Rym: Yes.

256
00:18:07,109 --> 00:18:08,130
Rym: Are they still around?

257
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:09,412
Rym: Actually, yes.

258
00:18:09,872 --> 00:18:14,038
Rym: And are they still violent and have they killed people in recent memory?

259
00:18:14,479 --> 00:18:15,120
Rym: Also, yes.

260
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,684
Scott: But basically, what are they really today?

261
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:21,971
Scott: It's like today, they're basically private eyes.

262
00:18:21,991 --> 00:18:25,960
Rym: They're a private security guard and detective agency.

263
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:35,534
Scott: But it's like instead of having to hire a private eye who's just a name on a door, it's a company that employs many private eyes and security guards.

264
00:18:35,774 --> 00:18:39,960
Rym: Founded during the Civil War to violently suppress organized labor.

265
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,845
Scott: They're history as dark and full of evil.

266
00:18:42,885 --> 00:18:46,273
Scott: But like if you own an office building or a concert venue.

267
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:47,916
Rym: You still shouldn't hire the Pinkertons.

268
00:18:47,997 --> 00:18:49,420
Rym: Hire any other security company.

269
00:18:50,521 --> 00:18:50,721
Scott: Right.

270
00:18:50,741 --> 00:18:56,368
Scott: But it's like today, in the present time, they're mostly just a security company.

271
00:18:57,409 --> 00:19:00,793
Scott: They just have a dark history, which is why I agree I wouldn't choose them.

272
00:19:01,294 --> 00:19:05,919
Scott: But all the other security companies are basically the same.

273
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,181
Rym: Here's what I would say.

274
00:19:07,201 --> 00:19:08,002
Rym: Zoom out a little bit.

275
00:19:08,042 --> 00:19:24,760
Rym: If you're hiring a security company and you could hire any of a dozen random security companies, or you could hire the one that's literally the same company that was founded during the Civil War to murder strikers, I don't think that company should continue to exist in a continued unbroken chain.

276
00:19:25,801 --> 00:19:31,569
Scott: But that has nothing to do with the story of WotC.

277
00:19:31,589 --> 00:19:39,780
Rym: But also if you're WotC, you don't hire a basically security guard to go raid some kid's house.

278
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:46,108
Scott: Yes, it's like the Pinkerton stuff, because of the history, blows up the sensationalism of the story.

279
00:19:46,448 --> 00:19:55,660
Scott: The reality, if you were to look at the story more realistically, it's just like WotC hired a private detective to go and recover stolen goods.

280
00:19:56,060 --> 00:20:01,126
Rym: According to the reporting, they say to intimidate and threaten the YouTuber.

281
00:20:01,146 --> 00:20:09,015
Rym: Partly, and it seems really between the lines, that the police didn't care because there didn't seem to be a crime?

282
00:20:09,535 --> 00:20:12,018
Rym: Like the kid just made a YouTube video with some things he had.

283
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:13,900
Rym: So it wasn't clear.

284
00:20:14,623 --> 00:20:18,320
Scott: Yeah, but those were unreleased magic cards that were illicitly obtained.

285
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:29,880
Rym: Yes, but the illicitness did not seem to rise to the level of cops in any way being willing to care, nor did it seem to rise to the level of wizards in any way being willing to sue, or take normal legal action.

286
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,216
Scott: Yeah, that's the part that I think is why.

287
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,264
Rym: Because I don't think that kid would have gotten in trouble.

288
00:20:33,604 --> 00:20:41,380
Rym: I'm not a lawyer, but based on everything I can see here, I don't think WotC could have done much about this.

289
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:50,773
Scott: Yeah, I mean, that's the thing that bothers me is that like, yeah, you know, for this kind of situation, you could have just hired a lawyer to take care of you.

290
00:20:50,873 --> 00:20:52,596
Scott: You have lawyers on staff, right?

291
00:20:52,756 --> 00:20:55,520
Scott: You don't need to go, you go to the lawyer first, right?

292
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:01,134
Scott: But, you know, the security angle, if you think about it, you know, what if your bike was stolen?

293
00:21:01,174 --> 00:21:03,279
Scott: It's like, well, the cops won't help you either, right?

294
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:13,240
Scott: It's like, if I had a bunch of money, and it was cheaper to hire, you know, security to go recover my bike, you know, then buy a new one, why wouldn't I do that?

295
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:22,960
Rym: Well, but he was totally willing to, like the YouTuber was totally willing to give the cards back if they were illegally obtained, though it seems like it might have been the game store just messed up and sent the wrong box.

296
00:21:23,861 --> 00:21:26,887
Rym: Or maybe, like, we don't know exactly what happened, but it was something like that.

297
00:21:27,508 --> 00:21:34,500
Rym: So, it seems what WotC was actually mad about was not that he had the cards, but that he made a YouTube video about them.

298
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:43,372
Rym: And that is almost definitely not in any way illegal, partly because also, it's not like he had an embargo contract signed.

299
00:21:43,633 --> 00:21:48,360
Rym: If anyone, the game store fucked up, and the game store is the only entity that should be able to get in trouble here.

300
00:21:49,503 --> 00:21:50,618
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know.

301
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:54,808
Rym: And even then, I don't respect embargoes on companies anyway.

302
00:21:55,209 --> 00:22:00,440
Rym: Like, I kinda love it when someone gets a copy of a game early and makes a YouTube video about it.

303
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,884
Scott: Well, I think this is a common problem, you know, nowadays, right?

304
00:22:03,944 --> 00:22:07,949
Scott: It's like, people had Breath of the Wild, Tears of the Kingdom copies early.

305
00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:08,310
Scott: Why?

306
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:16,360
Scott: Well, because they insist on still having physical cartridges, which means that they're in the targets in the back in the warehouse part before they're on the shelves.

307
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,087
Scott: They can't, like, show up at the store on release day.

308
00:22:19,107 --> 00:22:20,730
Scott: They can't guarantee that, right?

309
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,317
Scott: They gotta be there early, or they might be there early.

310
00:22:23,337 --> 00:22:23,698
Scott: You don't know.

311
00:22:23,718 --> 00:22:24,680
Scott: UPS isn't like holding them back.

312
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:33,980
Rym: Alright, so you got hundreds of thousands of people all around the world being paid minimum wage to handle boxes filled with thousands of copies of the hottest video game of the year.

313
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:40,447
Scott: Right, it's like, you know, it's like, if you don't want your shit getting out early, digital only, right?

314
00:22:40,888 --> 00:22:50,220
Scott: It's like, if you put out a physical good and you distribute it, you just have to accept the fact that you can't have this sort of firm, guaranteed release date.

315
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:56,466
Scott: Like, yeah, you can guarantee that everything will be there by that date, but something might get out a couple days early.

316
00:22:56,486 --> 00:22:57,387
Scott: It's gonna happen.

317
00:22:57,427 --> 00:23:04,775
Scott: You can't do anything about it, you know, unless you control the entire supply chain, like through a very narrow network, right?

318
00:23:04,815 --> 00:23:09,780
Scott: It's like, you only ship it with like your own couriers that you're paying, you know, something ridiculous.

319
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,040
Scott: And

320
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:35,619
Rym: partly what I blame here, because this is not nearly as big of a concern in most other industries, but there's a combination of certain nerdy intellectual properties are heavily conflated with YouTube streaming and the concept of spoilers and that concept being treated extremely overly seriously by both the companies and the hype companies and the marketing and the players and consumers.

321
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:37,400
Rym: that leads to the situation.

322
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:47,240
Rym: Because none of this stuff seems to violate laws or contracts, it just messes with their long term marketing strategies and people get a little too sweaty over it.

323
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:55,489
Scott: Yeah, I still have never heard, you know, I mean, it's one of those things where it's like, I really want to ask, you know, a Tim Apple or a Nintendo, right?

324
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:58,894
Scott: It's like, yes, we know you keep things secret, right?

325
00:23:59,234 --> 00:24:03,700
Scott: And it's like, yes, we can think up many reasons, right, why you might do that, right?

326
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:09,128
Scott: You know, reasonable explanations, but I've never heard you say the reasons for the secrecy.

327
00:24:09,228 --> 00:24:10,110
Scott: and are you sure?

328
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:16,920
Scott: do you have evidence to show that not being secret will actually, you know, hurt you in a tangible way?

329
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:28,579
Scott: What if you were super open and just like, had a magic development blog and talked about all the cards you're working like every day, all the magic game designers put out like a whole report of like, these are the ideas we were working on today, right?

330
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,166
Scott: It's like, would that hurt or help magic?

331
00:24:31,426 --> 00:24:35,878
Scott: You don't know because they just default to secrecy and don't even try the alternative, right?

332
00:24:35,898 --> 00:24:36,560
Scott: So how do they know?

333
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:45,950
Rym: And like Nintendo, how could someone having a live stream of a new Zelda game before it's officially out in any way impact sales?

334
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:55,120
Rym: because anyone who would not buy the game because they watch someone live stream it, they were going to watch the live stream that is finished the day after the game comes out.

335
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:59,987
Rym: So it's not, it literally could not impact sales in any way.

336
00:25:00,127 --> 00:25:00,928
Rym: that is plausible.

337
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:02,110
Scott: Nope.

338
00:25:02,631 --> 00:25:09,000
Rym: So the worst part is, and I'm quoting here from the Wikipedia article with several citations.

339
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:18,471
Rym: According to Wizards of the Coast, they hired the Pinkertons after several attempts had been made to contact the individual in private with no response.

340
00:25:18,912 --> 00:25:25,960
Rym: There's a, there's a lot of, I'd say buried leads behind that kind of statement.

341
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,529
Rym: They're basically saying we tried to email this person and they wouldn't answer us.

342
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:32,156
Rym: So then we sent the Pinkertons after them.

343
00:25:32,236 --> 00:25:33,720
Rym: That means that no other method.

344
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,845
Scott: There's a lot of, there's a lot of in between.

345
00:25:35,925 --> 00:25:38,131
Scott: you could have done, you know, the lawyer part.

346
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:41,860
Scott: A lawyer can contact someone a lot better than a security team.

347
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,404
Rym: The worst part is a lot of Magic.

348
00:25:44,424 --> 00:25:53,200
Rym: the Gathering people online were extremely supportive of this because they were really mad that spoilers about their stupid game appeared on the internet.

349
00:25:53,621 --> 00:25:55,343
Scott: So don't read them.

350
00:25:55,404 --> 00:25:56,766
Scott: Don't watch those YouTube videos.

351
00:25:56,906 --> 00:26:03,917
Rym: So there were a lot of Magic kids basically on Watchies Dick praising them for being so aggressive about this.

352
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:05,460
Scott: Whatever.

353
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:13,535
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

354
00:26:13,555 --> 00:26:22,650
Rym: So, uh, you know, I'm a big fan of someone does something in a sport and then that thing gets banned for various reasons like the old hockey tricks or whatever.

355
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:25,314
Scott: Or like, you know, many figure skating backflips.

356
00:26:25,434 --> 00:26:25,814
Rym: Oh yeah.

357
00:26:26,255 --> 00:26:30,801
Rym: But, uh, a technique I was unaware of and this three minute video is just fascinating.

358
00:26:30,821 --> 00:26:37,330
Rym: Uh, apparently there is a technique that for some people will just let you throw a shot put further.

359
00:26:37,991 --> 00:26:48,870
Rym: But this technique literally is do a cartwheel in the circle and throw it as part of doing a cartwheel like a forward jumping cartwheel.

360
00:26:49,351 --> 00:26:51,835
Scott: I can sort of imagine like I'm not an expert.

361
00:26:51,915 --> 00:27:01,010
Scott: I'd like, you know, whatever the biomechanics sport, whatever, you know, that whatever the side there is a science of like, you know, body movement right for athletic purposes.

362
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:06,778
Scott: But like, you know, I could imagine though that like, well, if you do a cartwheel, you got your hands on the ground, right?

363
00:27:07,139 --> 00:27:15,090
Scott: So that's going to give you like your hand is going to with the ball is going to be as close to the ground as possible and then go up to as high as it can go.

364
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:21,404
Scott: Pretty basically as quickly as you can to get the, you know, the greatest launch velocity, right?

365
00:27:21,785 --> 00:27:24,010
Scott: Usually you see shot put people what they like spin.

366
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:30,358
Rym: So this video actually shows an example of all modern reasonable shot put techniques.

367
00:27:30,378 --> 00:27:31,520
Rym: Like it's a really good video.

368
00:27:31,901 --> 00:27:36,728
Rym: Like there's the step back, there's the glide, there's the spin, which is the one you're thinking of.

369
00:27:36,768 --> 00:27:38,330
Rym: that I believe is what most people do today.

370
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:39,992
Scott: That's what most people in the Olympics do.

371
00:27:40,032 --> 00:27:40,212
Scott: Yeah.

372
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:55,070
Rym: And the best part about this video is that basically at every level of shot put like high schools, colleges, the NCAA, even up to the Olympics, there's a big debate over, well, is this allowed or not?

373
00:27:55,170 --> 00:28:04,390
Rym: Because by a strict reading of most of the rules and all these different leagues, this technique didn't break any of the written rules of like, you will be disqualified if you do this.

374
00:28:04,931 --> 00:28:09,078
Rym: And because people started doing this, like just recently, this is a new development.

375
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:15,990
Rym: One by one, basically every single organization has added a rule specifically banning the cartwheel.

376
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:16,670
Scott: Right.

377
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:24,221
Scott: Well, the question is, right, is that, you know, throughout the history of sports, right, there have been people developing new techniques.

378
00:28:24,341 --> 00:28:27,205
Scott: Everyone praises the Fosbury flop, right?

379
00:28:27,245 --> 00:28:30,910
Scott: It's like, ah, someone finally did the high jump backwards when we added the cushy mat.

380
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:31,311
Scott: Yeah.

381
00:28:31,351 --> 00:28:32,993
Scott: And that's the way everyone does the high jump.

382
00:28:33,314 --> 00:28:33,614
Scott: Right.

383
00:28:33,955 --> 00:28:35,598
Scott: And it's, you know, no one challenge.

384
00:28:35,658 --> 00:28:36,900
Scott: No one was like ban the flop.

385
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,123
Scott: You have to jump over the stick facing forwards.

386
00:28:39,204 --> 00:28:39,344
Scott: Right.

387
00:28:39,404 --> 00:28:40,586
Scott: It was it's praised.

388
00:28:40,686 --> 00:28:43,090
Scott: It's like, ah, yes, they fought that guy genius.

389
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:45,614
Scott: He found a new way to jump high and get over the stick.

390
00:28:46,175 --> 00:28:46,656
Scott: Wonderful.

391
00:28:46,696 --> 00:28:47,898
Scott: Now everyone does it that way.

392
00:28:47,918 --> 00:28:48,559
Scott: Right.

393
00:28:48,819 --> 00:28:55,210
Scott: So it's like the only reason they're legitimate reason to ban a technique in a sport such as this.

394
00:28:55,711 --> 00:28:55,931
Scott: Right.

395
00:28:56,272 --> 00:29:06,650
Scott: Would be if it was dangerous, like the ice, you know, the argument against the ice, the figure skating backflip is that if you have it, if you allow it, everyone's going to have to do it.

396
00:29:07,171 --> 00:29:10,315
Scott: And if you fuck it up, you hit your head on the ice and die.

397
00:29:10,536 --> 00:29:10,816
Scott: Right.

398
00:29:10,936 --> 00:29:12,319
Scott: Or damage it severely.

399
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:19,370
Scott: And so we can't have people like, you know, out there trying to practice it or having someone at the Olympics crack their skull open on the ice.

400
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:28,164
Rym: You know, those is an extra special situation because there are tons of techniques that are way better than what's allowed today.

401
00:29:28,565 --> 00:29:31,470
Rym: And they're all banned more because they make the sport silly.

402
00:29:31,951 --> 00:29:34,636
Rym: And it just becomes a throw a baseball as hard as you can.

403
00:29:34,716 --> 00:29:42,030
Rym: almost sport like the rules are weird about like you can't throw it from behind the line of your shoulders and you have to start holding it by your neck.

404
00:29:42,491 --> 00:29:45,878
Rym: They're like arbitrary constraints because otherwise the sport kind of doesn't work anymore.

405
00:29:47,181 --> 00:29:51,570
Scott: I mean, it's still the sport of here is a really heavy ball.

406
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:53,373
Scott: Throw it as far as you can.

407
00:29:53,614 --> 00:29:57,483
Scott: Like if you just limit the rules to and you can't leave this circle while you're throwing.

408
00:29:57,503 --> 00:29:58,285
Scott: Yeah, that's obvious.

409
00:29:58,385 --> 00:30:00,269
Scott: Otherwise you get a running start and then it's stupid.

410
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:00,490
Scott: Right.

411
00:30:01,011 --> 00:30:02,994
Rym: I don't think a running start would help that much though.

412
00:30:03,736 --> 00:30:04,176
Scott: I don't think so.

413
00:30:04,958 --> 00:30:09,526
Scott: Other than the running start, it's literally throw, you know, a heavy metal ball.

414
00:30:09,646 --> 00:30:10,968
Scott: It's like, what do you care?

415
00:30:11,008 --> 00:30:11,850
Scott: What the fucking technique?

416
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,472
Scott: So as long as it's not dangerous.

417
00:30:13,893 --> 00:30:14,193
Scott: Right.

418
00:30:14,453 --> 00:30:15,515
Scott: Because it is a heavy metal ball.

419
00:30:15,535 --> 00:30:17,558
Scott: There are dangerous ways you could hurt somebody.

420
00:30:17,598 --> 00:30:17,738
Scott: Right.

421
00:30:17,778 --> 00:30:20,722
Scott: But as long as it's not dangerous, what do we care?

422
00:30:21,023 --> 00:30:22,986
Scott: what method someone uses to throw it?

423
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:35,469
Rym: And I will say, having watched a bunch of videos of people doing their cartwheel, it does not appear to be more dangerous than a cartwheel and cartwheels are not particularly dangerous.

424
00:30:35,489 --> 00:30:35,670
Rym: Right.

425
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:40,956
Scott: If you could demonstrate to me that it's dangerous the way the ice skating backflip is dangerous, then I'll say fine, ban it.

426
00:30:41,637 --> 00:30:51,670
Scott: But if you can't, then I'm just going to say, hey, you just sort of actually hurt the sport of shot put because it could, you know, the flop helped the high jump.

427
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:51,950
Scott: Right.

428
00:30:52,531 --> 00:30:56,335
Scott: So, you know, you want to help your sport by having advancements.

429
00:30:56,615 --> 00:30:56,895
Scott: Right.

430
00:30:57,436 --> 00:30:57,736
Scott: Yeah.

431
00:30:58,797 --> 00:30:59,438
Rym: So, uh, yeah.

432
00:30:59,478 --> 00:31:03,062
Rym: But the side effect is I started learning more about banned things.

433
00:31:03,202 --> 00:31:07,647
Rym: And let me tell you, the javelin throws got some fucking bullshit that used to happen.

434
00:31:08,028 --> 00:31:08,969
Rym: Talk about some danger.

435
00:31:09,049 --> 00:31:10,210
Rym: Never mind the hammer throw.

436
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:13,075
Scott: Well, javelins are more dangerous.

437
00:31:14,077 --> 00:31:15,861
Rym: And the hammer throw, that thing is terrifying.

438
00:31:15,901 --> 00:31:17,945
Rym: Like I am legitimately afraid of hammer throws.

439
00:31:17,966 --> 00:31:19,990
Scott: I love to watch the hammer throw because it's terrifying.

440
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:20,852
Scott: Yeah.

441
00:31:21,553 --> 00:31:23,598
Rym: I want to be behind a fence if I'm watching it, though.

442
00:31:24,239 --> 00:31:27,025
Scott: Everyone's usually behind a fence except the person throwing the hammer.

443
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:27,225
Rym: Yep.

444
00:31:27,265 --> 00:31:29,470
Rym: So you got a thing of the day?

445
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:31,071
Scott: Uh, yeah.

446
00:31:31,091 --> 00:31:33,696
Scott: So here's, you know, just some YouTube channel with some kid.

447
00:31:33,936 --> 00:31:34,537
Scott: What's his name?

448
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:36,521
Scott: Tukov, something like that.

449
00:31:36,781 --> 00:31:37,823
Scott: What, you know, what?

450
00:31:37,903 --> 00:31:38,464
Rym: Oh, Tuvok12.

451
00:31:39,245 --> 00:31:39,947
Scott: Okay, Tuvok12.

452
00:31:39,987 --> 00:31:41,810
Rym: Tuvok is the name of a Star Trek character.

453
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:42,951
Scott: Okay.

454
00:31:43,451 --> 00:31:45,154
Scott: So anyway, it's this kid and his friends.

455
00:31:45,394 --> 00:31:45,634
Scott: Right.

456
00:31:45,995 --> 00:31:51,321
Scott: And it's just a really wholesome sort of, you know, what you expect from a TikTok YouTube thing.

457
00:31:51,742 --> 00:31:58,050
Scott: But what they do is they got, they got soccer ones, they got basketball ones, but I like the basketball ones better.

458
00:31:58,631 --> 00:32:00,753
Scott: And they basically, he's got a whole team of kids.

459
00:32:00,994 --> 00:32:01,254
Scott: Right.

460
00:32:01,554 --> 00:32:07,562
Scott: And they go out to a crowded public place and they got an entire basketball net full size.

461
00:32:07,902 --> 00:32:08,143
Scott: Right.

462
00:32:08,383 --> 00:32:13,590
Scott: And so most of the kids are carrying the basketball net, the full size net with everything.

463
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:13,850
Scott: Right.

464
00:32:14,371 --> 00:32:18,877
Scott: He, the Tuvok kid, who I think is the main kid, he's got a basketball.

465
00:32:19,157 --> 00:32:19,437
Scott: Right.

466
00:32:20,018 --> 00:32:22,862
Scott: And then they got a camera guy who you don't see because they're holding the camera.

467
00:32:23,623 --> 00:32:28,950
Scott: And then what they do is they go, they go out to people and the kids pick the net up.

468
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:36,340
Scott: And at the same time, he throws the ball at somebody gently expecting that person to like receive the ball and take a shot.

469
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:36,761
Scott: Right.

470
00:32:37,301 --> 00:32:40,346
Scott: And then he just makes a compilation of all the different people.

471
00:32:40,706 --> 00:32:40,866
Scott: Right.

472
00:32:40,906 --> 00:32:43,390
Scott: Whether they take a shot or not and sort of rates them.

473
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,072
Scott: You know, on a scale of one to ten.

474
00:32:45,192 --> 00:32:46,034
Rym: Three out of ten.

475
00:32:46,694 --> 00:32:47,736
Scott: And first of all.

476
00:32:47,856 --> 00:32:48,036
Scott: Right.

477
00:32:48,076 --> 00:32:49,058
Scott: So it's really wholesome.

478
00:32:49,158 --> 00:32:50,139
Scott: Like you're just out in public.

479
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,621
Scott: Someone tosses you a basketball.

480
00:32:51,702 --> 00:32:52,943
Scott: A net appears out of nowhere.

481
00:32:53,023 --> 00:32:54,245
Scott: It's like, yeah, I take a shot.

482
00:32:54,325 --> 00:32:57,770
Scott: And then if someone makes the shot, they party like they get all excited.

483
00:32:58,291 --> 00:33:00,115
Scott: And, you know, it's a lot of fun.

484
00:33:00,135 --> 00:33:06,170
Rym: I mean, if this happened to me and I somehow made the shot because I'm a terrible shot in basketball, I'd definitely be doing a Hulk Hogan or something.

485
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:07,171
Scott: Yeah.

486
00:33:07,311 --> 00:33:11,416
Scott: So the things to learn, you know, even though it's just this cute little concept.

487
00:33:11,636 --> 00:33:11,817
Scott: Right.

488
00:33:11,837 --> 00:33:12,978
Scott: There's a lot going on here.

489
00:33:13,038 --> 00:33:18,165
Scott: First of all, you can see the sad, terrible humans who like kick the ball away.

490
00:33:18,285 --> 00:33:18,846
Scott: Ignore it.

491
00:33:18,966 --> 00:33:19,507
Scott: Dodge it.

492
00:33:19,687 --> 00:33:20,288
Scott: Block it.

493
00:33:20,468 --> 00:33:22,050
Scott: You know, you'll get mad.

494
00:33:22,851 --> 00:33:27,378
Scott: I think I saw in one of the videos someone takes the ball, like tries to throw it away somewhere because they're angry.

495
00:33:27,398 --> 00:33:29,262
Scott: Those are all terrible human beings.

496
00:33:29,302 --> 00:33:33,710
Scott: And what we should do is we should divide the Earth into the people who take the shot and the people who don't.

497
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:37,137
Scott: And the people who don't can go to Australia and then we can have the rest of the Earth.

498
00:33:37,457 --> 00:33:38,500
Scott: And that would be peace on Earth.

499
00:33:39,001 --> 00:33:41,426
Rym: Nobody who can't take the shot would survive Australia.

500
00:33:41,446 --> 00:33:43,210
Scott: That's exactly the point.

501
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:49,415
Scott: And the second thing, right, is what was I going to say?

502
00:33:50,797 --> 00:33:51,658
Rym: What were you going to say?

503
00:33:52,258 --> 00:33:55,462
Scott: I forget now, but the point is the people who don't take the shot suck.

504
00:33:55,502 --> 00:33:56,142
Scott: That's the point.

505
00:33:56,783 --> 00:34:01,849
Rym: And it's a good reason to like if you broke your arm and you literally can't lift it or like there's.

506
00:34:01,889 --> 00:34:03,010
Scott: no there's no one like that.

507
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:04,152
Scott: But it's just a lot of.

508
00:34:04,232 --> 00:34:05,855
Scott: it's just such a wholesome concept.

509
00:34:05,915 --> 00:34:12,607
Scott: And I love how it uses the clip from the Lil Nas X SOG where it's like, you know, this one is for the champions.

510
00:34:12,647 --> 00:34:14,130
Scott: And then they take the shot every time.

511
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:21,297
Rym: I love celebratory, low key fun, like staged human interaction like this.

512
00:34:21,338 --> 00:34:24,262
Rym: Like this is exactly the kind of thing that would have.

513
00:34:24,302 --> 00:34:25,822
Scott: not it's not hurting anybody.

514
00:34:25,842 --> 00:34:31,170
Scott: You know, bringing a little spite, a moment of joy that takes less than like 10 seconds in the people's lives.

515
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:38,402
Rym: But like we're at RIT and every now like, you know, on a college campus, for any of you who are, you know, a lot of a lot of the listener are pretty young.

516
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:42,989
Rym: And I haven't been to college yet or haven't been to college in like 20 or 30 years.

517
00:34:43,969 --> 00:34:46,833
Rym: There's not a lot of middle ground in terms of the listener of GeekNights.

518
00:34:46,934 --> 00:34:58,090
Rym: But there was something about living on a college campus where low key fun stuff like this, like strangers would accost you politely with something funny or weird on a pretty regular basis.

519
00:34:58,711 --> 00:35:01,897
Rym: And that is a better life than never interacting with anyone on the street.

520
00:35:02,539 --> 00:35:02,659
Scott: Yeah.

521
00:35:02,739 --> 00:35:08,510
Scott: And it's just now that that sort of shit is on YouTube, whereas back in the day, you could only experience it if you were in such a place.

522
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:09,091
Scott: Yeah.

523
00:35:09,552 --> 00:35:17,590
Scott: And people weren't doing it for to get a you know, they were just doing it for fun of itself and not, you know, necessarily doing it to make videos.

524
00:35:19,231 --> 00:35:25,222
Rym: In the moment, GeekNights Book Club book, which we will do the show on Thursday, the satanic versus we delayed.

525
00:35:25,242 --> 00:35:26,805
Scott: Oh, we still didn't do a show on that.

526
00:35:26,845 --> 00:35:28,669
Rym: No, because I got sick and we couldn't.

527
00:35:28,689 --> 00:35:29,090
Scott: All right.

528
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:30,911
Scott: It's been a while.

529
00:35:31,512 --> 00:35:32,153
Rym: What a fucking.

530
00:35:32,233 --> 00:35:34,015
Rym: I want to read everything this guy wrote.

531
00:35:34,135 --> 00:35:37,740
Rym: Just his prose is this is top tier prose.

532
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:45,490
Rym: But the thing I like the most not to get into it because we're going to show on it is the there's always the sort of immediately gets into it not to get into it immediately.

533
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:49,155
Rym: But there's this pattern of his writing that is consistent through the whole book.

534
00:35:49,816 --> 00:35:52,300
Rym: And it stuck with me was this.

535
00:35:53,081 --> 00:35:59,030
Rym: He'll just throw in two words in a row in a sentence that grammatically do not work.

536
00:35:59,531 --> 00:36:08,522
Rym: But they convey either a duality or a dissonance like the condemnation, damnation of man, like lines like that.

537
00:36:08,602 --> 00:36:10,385
Rym: That sort of like florid prose.

538
00:36:11,006 --> 00:36:14,270
Rym: That pattern was so consistent and so well used.

539
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:18,214
Rym: And that's the kind of shit I love about reading a book like this.

540
00:36:18,575 --> 00:36:31,670
Rym: That is, to be to be really blunt, not common in most science fiction or nerdy literature and is much more common in what a lot of people call literature with a capital L.

541
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:32,691
Scott: Like but this.

542
00:36:32,771 --> 00:36:33,933
Scott: but this is a fantasy novel.

543
00:36:34,013 --> 00:36:44,087
Rym: It is just a fantasy novel, but it is written with the top tier of the art of writing words on a page in a way to evoke feelings.

544
00:36:44,748 --> 00:36:45,068
Scott: Anyway.

545
00:36:45,649 --> 00:36:45,950
Scott: All right.

546
00:36:46,951 --> 00:36:52,902
Rym: Other meta things website is like real imminent and we both have to do some stuff now to move in.

547
00:36:52,962 --> 00:36:54,325
Scott: It's pretty close.

548
00:36:54,425 --> 00:36:56,990
Scott: It really just needs like some front end action.

549
00:36:57,870 --> 00:37:03,118
Scott: It's you know, there are missing features, but they are not features which are essential for launch.

550
00:37:03,398 --> 00:37:03,598
Scott: Right.

551
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:12,370
Scott: You know, it's still not where I'd want it to be, but it's complete enough and better enough than the current website that it can go up.

552
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:14,754
Scott: And it's not like anyone goes to our website anyway.

553
00:37:14,854 --> 00:37:15,054
Scott: Yeah.

554
00:37:15,375 --> 00:37:17,639
Rym: The website is just an anchor point.

555
00:37:17,699 --> 00:37:18,059
Rym: Really.

556
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,944
Rym: All that matters is the RSS and the databases and all that other stuff.

557
00:37:21,605 --> 00:37:22,066
Scott: Exactly.

558
00:37:22,086 --> 00:37:24,470
Scott: And that's the stuff that's really, you know, solids.

559
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:24,870
Rym: Yep.

560
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:30,236
Rym: So sometime in the near future, be ready for possibly a week of like only one show.

561
00:37:30,376 --> 00:37:33,260
Rym: And that's the show we use for the cut transition.

562
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,120
Rym: Like we'll see what happens.

563
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:39,086
Rym: We got to sort all this out and we can finally say goodbye to gig nights.

564
00:37:39,166 --> 00:37:40,407
Rym: Web 2.0 edition.

565
00:37:41,028 --> 00:37:42,730
Scott: You can look at it on archive.org.

566
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,653
Scott: Yep.

567
00:37:45,074 --> 00:37:45,795
Rym: Other meta bits.

568
00:37:45,895 --> 00:37:47,358
Rym: Let's see what else is going on.

569
00:37:47,378 --> 00:37:49,602
Rym: I got nothing else new.

570
00:37:49,682 --> 00:37:50,443
Rym: No cons to PAX West.

571
00:37:50,463 --> 00:37:52,607
Scott: PAX West is a long time from now.

572
00:37:52,707 --> 00:37:54,350
Scott: So go to the beach and wait for that.

573
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:54,930
Rym: Yep.

574
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:56,152
Rym: We're going to be at PAX West.

575
00:37:56,293 --> 00:37:59,238
Rym: I imagine doing between one and two panels as is typical.

576
00:37:59,618 --> 00:38:06,330
Rym: So I expect it's going to be a full on normal PAX for me and Scott and the core gig nights crew.

577
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:11,257
Rym: So if you go to PAX West, we should play some games together because we will be there playing games.

578
00:38:13,721 --> 00:38:14,361
Rym: All right.

579
00:38:14,422 --> 00:38:15,283
Rym: Let's just get right into it.

580
00:38:15,603 --> 00:38:19,268
Rym: Now, if you care about spoilers, just don't listen to this.

581
00:38:19,289 --> 00:38:20,330
Rym: Just go play the game.

582
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:22,669
Scott: What spoiler could there possibly be?

583
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:34,464
Rym: So watching the opening video, like playing the game when you do the initial scenario, like go down into the deep the whole time, it's just Zelda's like, I wonder what could be down here.

584
00:38:34,624 --> 00:38:36,286
Rym: And I just couldn't help but yell.

585
00:38:36,726 --> 00:38:37,547
Rym: It's Ganon.

586
00:38:38,208 --> 00:38:39,810
Rym: every time she said anything.

587
00:38:40,792 --> 00:38:46,665
Rym: And it just kept going like this scene like, oh, there's like, there's this.

588
00:38:46,705 --> 00:38:47,988
Scott: I wonder who the bad guy is.

589
00:38:48,008 --> 00:38:48,409
Scott: Is it Ganon?

590
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:59,566
Rym: But if you somehow think that anything significant could be spoiled for you in this game, just don't listen, because why do you need to hear anyone talk about the game?

591
00:38:59,586 --> 00:39:02,230
Rym: Because you're playing it right now and you're afraid of spoilers.

592
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:08,797
Rym: So just turn this episode off and just go play your freaking game because we're going to lightly spoil stuff because we're going to talk about what we've experienced so far.

593
00:39:09,178 --> 00:39:10,940
Rym: But also we have not beaten it.

594
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:16,946
Rym: We'll probably do a sort of final thought at some point in the future, but we're playing it.

595
00:39:17,187 --> 00:39:20,270
Rym: I am probably like an eighth of the way through if I had to guess.

596
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:20,631
Rym: Yeah.

597
00:39:21,313 --> 00:39:25,203
Scott: So Breath of the Wild, right, came out in 2017.

598
00:39:25,203 --> 00:39:27,730
Scott: So it's a six year old game, right?

599
00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:41,199
Rym: And you got to remember, we cannot understate or I cannot overstate that, in my opinion, it is the best Legend of Zelda game that had ever been released up to that point.

600
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:57,190
Rym: Not that there are not great Zelda games, but Breath of the Wild felt like it took the stated intent of the original Legend of Zelda, Zelda one on the Famicom and fully realized what they wanted it to be.

601
00:39:57,570 --> 00:40:04,330
Rym: Which was a game about exploring through the woods like you're a kid again and finding things.

602
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:15,870
Scott: But anyway, so it actually people don't possibly don't remember that game even came out on the Wii U when the Switch was super new and the Wii U was super old, it came out on both.

603
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:21,975
Scott: And so presumably around that time, they must have started on the next one, right?

604
00:40:22,135 --> 00:40:23,277
Scott: Somewhere around there.

605
00:40:23,617 --> 00:40:35,790
Scott: And as what we seem to have heard from interviews with Aonuma and other things, right, is that it seems like Tears of the Kingdom was basically done like quite a while ago.

606
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:45,610
Scott: Well, quote done, right, done-ish like a year plus ago, and then they spent like about a year just polishing what could have been a done game, right?

607
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:48,129
Rym: And that's all I'll say right now, it shows.

608
00:40:48,872 --> 00:40:56,310
Scott: Right, so when they announced Tears of the Kingdom, at least when they announced we're going to make Breath of the Wild 2, I was like, what are you going to do, right?

609
00:40:56,410 --> 00:41:12,470
Scott: Every Zelda game to this point was always, I think most of them at least, were like, alright, it's a new game on a new map, possibly even a new timeline, a new universe, but it's still the same Zelda, Link, Ganon, Deal forces, right?

610
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:13,171
Scott: And there

611
00:41:13,191 --> 00:41:31,809
Rym: were two sort of main threads, like there was one thread that kind of, it started, I'd say it was Zelda 3, there's a certain kind of interlocking, gated, open up areas with items quest structure, and then there's a more like directly narrative structure type of game, but those are broad

612
00:41:31,829 --> 00:41:32,590
Scott: thing ideas.

613
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:35,770
Scott: The point is that none of those games had direct sequels.

614
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:47,550
Rym: Well, Zelda 2 is direct, it was stated in the instruction book in Japanese and in English, it was a direct contiguous sequel from Zelda 1.

615
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:52,470
Scott: But it wasn't a direct sequel in the sense that like it was the same exact kind of game, right?

616
00:41:52,610 --> 00:42:00,070
Rym: Yeah, it was a completely different kind of game on a completely different map, but it was, story wise, it was a direct sequel.

617
00:42:00,591 --> 00:42:12,370
Scott: Sure, but when you say we're gonna make Breath of the Wild 2, right, it's like, well, it's gonna be basically like, it's not gonna be a different kind of game from Breath of the Wild, the way Zelda 2 is a different kind of game from Zelda 1, right?

618
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:27,390
Scott: It's gonna be like the same game engine, you know, and it's like, well, if it's the same map, it's like, I was thinking like, are they, you know, on the one hand, when they say Breath of the Wild 2, I'm like, are they just gonna like change it a little bit?

619
00:42:27,651 --> 00:42:34,428
Scott: And I'm like, I'm not hyped for that at all, but then it's like, well, it's Nintendo, they don't do anything small time like that, right?

620
00:42:34,448 --> 00:42:35,310
Scott: That's not a thing they do.

621
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:44,929
Rym: My original thoughts were either it was gonna be a radically reinvented version of the existing map or it was gonna be the same engine but a completely different map, like it goes to another continent.

622
00:42:45,069 --> 00:42:45,670
Rym: That was my guess.

623
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:49,950
Scott: Yes, there had to be some plot like Link goes to another world or some shit, right?

624
00:42:50,491 --> 00:42:56,198
Scott: So they basically did, you know, if you don't know already, they did both things, right?

625
00:42:56,238 --> 00:43:04,750
Scott: Number one, they came up with a plot plus mechanical structure to keep and also basically change the entire map.

626
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:15,719
Scott: Yeah, I can generally in the same, they're generally in the same place, but and some things are almost exactly the same, but almost nothing.

627
00:43:15,779 --> 00:43:26,387
Scott: It's like a completely new, you know, it's like if you left, it's like if you left your town, even though I guess plot wise, it's only a few years from Breath of the Wild, like five years, something like that.

628
00:43:26,407 --> 00:43:28,829
Scott: It's like if you moved away from home and came back 100 years later.

629
00:43:29,976 --> 00:43:30,789
Scott: That's what it's like.

630
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:46,310
Rym: But also, on top of that, they did the thing that Final Fantasy IV did where Final Fantasy IV, if you don't remember, you're playing this game and then you're like, alright, it's a Final Fantasy, it's a big world map and at some point, you go into a volcano and there's a whole fucking other world map down there.

631
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:50,090
Rym: And then you go up into the moon and there's a whole fucking other world map up there.

632
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:58,481
Scott: And it's like, they felt like, well, you know, we have this main overworld map and it's still, it's a direct sequel, it's the same Hyrule, so you can't change it too much.

633
00:43:59,082 --> 00:44:00,284
Scott: How can we, right?

634
00:44:00,344 --> 00:44:02,326
Scott: So they added two more maps, right?

635
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:04,970
Scott: An underground map, which is as big as the overworld map.

636
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:14,670
Scott: And then they put stuff in the sky and the sky way up high, there's not too much of it, I guess surface area wise, but it's still a whole nother world.

637
00:44:14,931 --> 00:44:23,070
Rym: And it is dense with content and many of the, there are puzzles that span those maps within the same direction.

638
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:33,050
Scott: So it's like, it's like, okay, you know, we're going to make a direct sequel, but we're going to triple this, you know, almost triple the size of the game and redo the surface area that we had to start with, right?

639
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:36,739
Scott: So you're getting, it is a full on new deal.

640
00:44:36,859 --> 00:44:41,210
Scott: It's not some like light touch, you know, incremental upgrade, right?

641
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:45,458
Rym: But on top of that, they took, cause there's two more big additions.

642
00:44:45,638 --> 00:44:47,522
Rym: One is the plot story, which I'm going to talk about briefly.

643
00:44:47,822 --> 00:44:52,150
Rym: And then there's what they did mechanically, which is sort of the most important thing.

644
00:44:52,330 --> 00:44:55,457
Scott: But plot wise, they basically admitted this, right?

645
00:44:55,517 --> 00:45:01,170
Scott: They watched everyone playing Breath of the Wild, doing ridiculous bullshit with the powers that were available.

646
00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:05,329
Scott: The magnet power, the inertia power, you know, what were the other ones?

647
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:05,811
Scott: Yeah.

648
00:45:05,831 --> 00:45:14,150
Rym: Well, but basically they, they, they seem to have looked at how people played and one they zoomed in on, was there anything that was annoying to players?

649
00:45:14,911 --> 00:45:16,113
Rym: And they just fixed those things.

650
00:45:16,133 --> 00:45:22,084
Rym: There's a ton of quality of life stuff, like the recipes for the food, all these like little things they just tweaked.

651
00:45:22,124 --> 00:45:25,590
Rym: Like if you open a chest and your inventory is full, you can drop something right there.

652
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:27,794
Rym: You don't have to close the chest, go into your inventory, open it again.

653
00:45:28,174 --> 00:45:33,223
Rym: But then those machines, they're like, oh, so people would like take minecarts to make weird machines.

654
00:45:33,663 --> 00:45:36,047
Rym: We're going to make that a primary mechanic of the game now.

655
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:37,450
Rym: And we're going to over, over develop it.

656
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:41,102
Scott: It's not make it a primary, it's not make it a primary mechanic of the game.

657
00:45:41,202 --> 00:45:43,350
Scott: It was like, we are going to make that the game, right?

658
00:45:44,071 --> 00:45:50,900
Scott: They saw the high level Breath of the Wild people, the people who kept playing it and playing it and playing it and getting lots and lots out of it, right?

659
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:53,823
Scott: Using those abilities that you got, right?

660
00:45:54,044 --> 00:45:59,150
Scott: To do ridiculous nonsense, you know, using boxes and balls and barrels.

661
00:45:59,311 --> 00:46:03,046
Rym: And now they're like, all right, you want fans and jets and lasers?

662
00:46:03,207 --> 00:46:03,890
Rym: You want to make robots?

663
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:04,551
Scott: So they're like, fine.

664
00:46:04,731 --> 00:46:06,033
Scott: Is that, that's what you like to do.

665
00:46:06,113 --> 00:46:08,136
Scott: People have fun doing that, right?

666
00:46:08,256 --> 00:46:12,623
Scott: But really in Breath of the Wild, only pro people can really explore that.

667
00:46:12,743 --> 00:46:14,325
Scott: And the space is not very large.

668
00:46:14,666 --> 00:46:17,290
Scott: So it's like, okay, that's clearly a thing people are doing to have fun.

669
00:46:17,811 --> 00:46:20,498
Scott: We're going to make the second game all about that.

670
00:46:20,538 --> 00:46:24,690
Scott: We'll make it easy for anyone to do and we'll expand it a hundred thousand fold.

671
00:46:25,271 --> 00:46:28,374
Scott: And we'll make that the core focus of the game, right?

672
00:46:28,654 --> 00:46:43,070
Scott: Literally everything in the game is focused on building contraptions and construction and making devices and all that sort of nonsense and finding clever ways to use the new and different abilities.

673
00:46:43,591 --> 00:46:54,545
Scott: And so even if they hadn't changed the map, and even if they hadn't added one in a fraction more maps, right, to the existing map, that alone, right, would have been enough.

674
00:46:54,585 --> 00:46:56,807
Scott: Just change all the abilities to make it a new game.

675
00:46:56,948 --> 00:46:58,750
Scott: But they did both things, right?

676
00:46:59,571 --> 00:47:10,646
Rym: And so it is like, it was something when I realized, wait, so I can just make a plane and put a engine on it and fly it around.

677
00:47:10,966 --> 00:47:12,749
Rym: And then like, what if I attach a flamethrower to the front?

678
00:47:12,769 --> 00:47:13,770
Rym: Yeah, that totally works.

679
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:15,472
Scott: Yep, go right ahead.

680
00:47:15,592 --> 00:47:16,874
Scott: Be our guest, right?

681
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:28,230
Scott: And I think the genius of it is that, you know, it's like you typically in games, you know, in games where you're a character occupying a space, you know, flight is sort of like the cheat mode.

682
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:29,835
Scott: That's like what you want to achieve, right?

683
00:47:29,855 --> 00:47:34,290
Scott: You think about like Kirby's Adventure, where it's like you could just fly over a lot of levels without even doing anything.

684
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:42,090
Rym: And even in Breath of the Wild, like how a lot of times it felt cheap when what I would do is find the tallest fucking point I could get to jump off of it and glide somewhere.

685
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:45,076
Scott: Or in Mario Brothers, you just use P-Wing, right?

686
00:47:45,357 --> 00:47:51,490
Scott: Or, you know, you get even, you know, just get on top of the bricks in an underground world and run across the top and get to the end and skip everything, right?

687
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:53,114
Scott: Flying has always been the cheat.

688
00:47:53,254 --> 00:47:59,650
Scott: Well, what they did is like, OK, well, first of all, we're going to put some stuff that's so high that it's like, yeah, you could fly anywhere.

689
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:00,211
Scott: Go ahead.

690
00:48:00,371 --> 00:48:03,097
Scott: We'll put a bunch of stuff for you to get even by flying.

691
00:48:03,117 --> 00:48:04,420
Scott: So you're rewarded for flying.

692
00:48:04,921 --> 00:48:09,170
Scott: But some stuff is so high, you maybe can't even reach it with easy flying.

693
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:11,757
Scott: You're going to have to think about an even better way to fly.

694
00:48:11,798 --> 00:48:12,219
Scott: Good luck.

695
00:48:12,439 --> 00:48:16,070
Rym: Never mind getting into the deep and all those caves and everything everywhere.

696
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:26,970
Scott: And then we're even going to give you an ability that lets you, if you have a ceiling within a close enough distance, fly directly up through that ceiling, up to the surface, wherever you are.

697
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:29,295
Rym: There are so many good puzzles that rely on that.

698
00:48:29,316 --> 00:48:29,917
Rym: Right.

699
00:48:29,997 --> 00:48:31,301
Scott: It's like go up anywhere.

700
00:48:31,522 --> 00:48:32,143
Scott: You want to go up?

701
00:48:32,625 --> 00:48:33,327
Scott: Be our guest.

702
00:48:33,367 --> 00:48:34,550
Rym: Go up all you want.

703
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:35,431
Rym: You want to go down?

704
00:48:35,451 --> 00:48:36,153
Rym: Go down all you want.

705
00:48:36,193 --> 00:48:38,038
Rym: Go fly across the entire map.

706
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:38,820
Scott: You can't go.

707
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:39,342
Scott: That's the thing.

708
00:48:39,362 --> 00:48:40,845
Scott: You can't go down all you want.

709
00:48:40,946 --> 00:48:42,490
Scott: It's pretty hard to go down.

710
00:48:43,011 --> 00:48:43,292
Scott: Right.

711
00:48:43,512 --> 00:48:46,198
Scott: And there's no easy way to go down always.

712
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:49,946
Rym: It is easy to go down between sky world and land world.

713
00:48:49,966 --> 00:48:50,528
Rym: Yeah.

714
00:48:50,548 --> 00:48:51,470
Scott: You just jump down.

715
00:48:52,051 --> 00:49:02,090
Scott: But I'm telling you like, but if you want to go down into something, right, let's say you're on a mountain and the shrine sensors going off and you know, there's a shrine under your feet inside this mountain.

716
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:04,857
Scott: It's like, all right, find the cave entrance.

717
00:49:04,998 --> 00:49:06,461
Scott: There's no other way you're going to get in there.

718
00:49:07,003 --> 00:49:09,690
Scott: You got to go find the cave entrance and fight your way through the cave.

719
00:49:10,031 --> 00:49:14,442
Scott: There's no downwards teleport and you can't go into the underworld and teleport up.

720
00:49:14,482 --> 00:49:15,183
Scott: That's not allowed.

721
00:49:15,223 --> 00:49:15,344
Scott: Right.

722
00:49:15,364 --> 00:49:17,649
Scott: You can only teleport up in like the same area.

723
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:29,650
Scott: So, you know, going down, they made that the challenge and they flipped everything upside down from what's normal in video games, which is where usually going up and flying is difficult.

724
00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:37,299
Rym: And I guess what's really neat is how radically different those three world maps feel as well.

725
00:49:37,379 --> 00:49:45,430
Rym: Like the bottom world, the deep, it's terrifying when you first see it, but once you sort of figure out its deal, it really feels like the caves in Naoshika just straight up.

726
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:47,973
Scott: It's just dark, right?

727
00:49:48,053 --> 00:49:49,817
Scott: Once you light it up, it's like, okay.

728
00:49:50,018 --> 00:49:55,350
Scott: But I think the only problem is that even if you light it up, it's not scary, but the bad guys down there are more dangerous.

729
00:49:56,013 --> 00:49:59,450
Rym: And also it is difficult to navigate down there.

730
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:00,551
Scott: And it's dark.

731
00:50:00,631 --> 00:50:03,196
Scott: I think that's the other in an open world game.

732
00:50:03,576 --> 00:50:04,398
Scott: It's like, okay, sure.

733
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:05,580
Scott: You can go anywhere you want.

734
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:05,940
Scott: Right.

735
00:50:06,381 --> 00:50:07,924
Scott: But it's hard to go anywhere.

736
00:50:08,064 --> 00:50:11,450
Scott: Usually a lot of times that I'm in the sky or the normal overworld.

737
00:50:11,891 --> 00:50:15,178
Scott: I take out the binoculars and I'm looking all around, right?

738
00:50:15,539 --> 00:50:17,102
Scott: Scouting out, see where I'm going to go.

739
00:50:17,122 --> 00:50:18,285
Scott: Ooh, there's a shrine over there.

740
00:50:18,325 --> 00:50:19,327
Scott: There's a thing over there.

741
00:50:19,347 --> 00:50:19,908
Scott: There's a right.

742
00:50:20,048 --> 00:50:20,770
Scott: Oh, that looks good.

743
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:25,857
Scott: In the darkness, you can only throw so many bright bloom whatevers, right?

744
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:26,698
Scott: And see so far.

745
00:50:27,179 --> 00:50:32,326
Scott: If you haven't lit up the lamps yet, it's like, okay, you know, which direction you want to go?

746
00:50:32,626 --> 00:50:35,110
Scott: Into the darkness or attack the other darkness?

747
00:50:35,891 --> 00:50:36,632
Scott: See what's out there.

748
00:50:36,872 --> 00:50:39,975
Rym: Or hope you find a map that gives you a waypoint to try to get to.

749
00:50:40,075 --> 00:50:50,866
Rym: But clever game design, usually when you have waypoints like that in the deep, if you just point yourself in the mini map straight at that waypoint, that is probably the worst possible way to get there.

750
00:50:51,107 --> 00:50:54,290
Rym: You've got to approach it more like it's a real place.

751
00:50:56,130 --> 00:51:05,983
Scott: And I guess much like Breath of the Wild, you still have the sort of challenge of, you know, if you want to climb over a thing instead of, you know, flying or something, right?

752
00:51:06,364 --> 00:51:10,429
Scott: You know, you can sort of use your stamina and try to, you know, or build a car.

753
00:51:11,391 --> 00:51:23,690
Scott: Yeah, you can find, you got to find, you know, sometimes there's like a direct correct way, intended way to go somewhere like up a path, but you can go up another way if you can make it happen, right?

754
00:51:24,871 --> 00:51:26,152
Rym: Yep.

755
00:51:26,172 --> 00:51:37,163
Rym: The other big change they made is that instead of having all these different kinds of arrows, and I really think this is an important change because it leads to a bigger concept about this game of why I think it feels so satisfying.

756
00:51:37,624 --> 00:51:43,650
Rym: Instead, you can just apply anything in your inventory to an arrow and they all do crazy different stuff.

757
00:51:44,151 --> 00:51:44,371
Scott: Yep.

758
00:51:44,411 --> 00:51:46,955
Scott: They gave the fuse, the fuse ability, right?

759
00:51:47,215 --> 00:51:50,760
Scott: You can just attach things to your weapons or your armor.

760
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:53,544
Scott: or well, not your armor, but your shields, your arrows and your weapons.

761
00:51:54,005 --> 00:51:55,267
Scott: You can mix and match, right?

762
00:51:55,307 --> 00:51:57,530
Scott: And that's sort of, they put a plot thing in there.

763
00:51:58,151 --> 00:51:58,271
Scott: Right?

764
00:51:58,291 --> 00:51:58,651
Scott: It's like, aha.

765
00:51:58,671 --> 00:51:59,792
Scott: Decayed weapons.

766
00:52:00,393 --> 00:52:00,673
Scott: Right.

767
00:52:00,833 --> 00:52:03,436
Scott: You get, it's like all the weapons are decayed, right?

768
00:52:03,456 --> 00:52:06,860
Scott: So now there's a plot reason that they're all rusting on you, right?

769
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:07,520
Scott: Okay.

770
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:11,745
Scott: So you get weapons, but then you combine the weapons with something else.

771
00:52:11,825 --> 00:52:16,650
Scott: Like, ah, I'll attach this tree trunk to my sword and now it's a tree trunk sword.

772
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:23,890
Rym: Or I'll get this really long, like shaped horn from a particular enemy and put it on a stick and now I basically got a Naginata.

773
00:52:24,871 --> 00:52:25,191
Scott: Right.

774
00:52:25,211 --> 00:52:33,690
Scott: It's like, you know, you can get creative with your combinations, you know, and it's like, that's a whole mechanic of like choosing and making your weapons.

775
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:48,250
Rym: But those combined, coupled with the machine building leads to, I think, a bigger change because the most fun in Breath of the Wild was before you had a bunch of good weapons and you had to like solve problems like, ooh, there's monsters there.

776
00:52:48,691 --> 00:52:50,915
Rym: I'm gonna roll bombs down on them until they die.

777
00:52:51,316 --> 00:52:58,670
Rym: Or you get to the one challenge island where you're naked and alone and have to play like your early game again and like how fun that was.

778
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:06,819
Rym: The time in Breath of the Wild until you're strong enough and have enough equipment to where you're not doing that anymore is pretty short.

779
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:14,230
Rym: The time in Tears of the Kingdom until you're not doing shit like that, I don't think you hit that point before you beat the game.

780
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:19,394
Rym: Like, there is no point where you think, I got enough good weapons.

781
00:53:19,695 --> 00:53:20,596
Rym: I can just fight things.

782
00:53:20,676 --> 00:53:20,876
Rym: No.

783
00:53:21,757 --> 00:53:26,023
Rym: As far as I've played, I am still doing sneaky shit to beat monsters.

784
00:53:26,103 --> 00:53:31,730
Rym: Like, it is still like I'm naked and alone on that island from Breath of the Wild 1.

785
00:53:31,730 --> 00:53:35,336
Scott: Well, I think they also, you know, some of the enemies are much more dangerous.

786
00:53:35,476 --> 00:53:35,917
Scott: Oh, yeah.

787
00:53:36,618 --> 00:53:42,668
Scott: And, you know, I think the other thing is it's like in Breath of the Wild, it's like, okay, you got 100 Bokoblin horns.

788
00:53:43,029 --> 00:53:43,870
Scott: What good are they?

789
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:44,992
Rym: I'm going to sell them to people.

790
00:53:45,492 --> 00:53:46,273
Scott: You can sell them.

791
00:53:46,474 --> 00:53:46,774
Scott: You can.

792
00:53:46,814 --> 00:53:50,139
Scott: maybe, you know, it might be some quest where someone asked for them.

793
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:57,650
Scott: You might be able to make, there might be some recipes that use them for cooking, but otherwise you're just collecting Bokoblin horns for what?

794
00:53:58,450 --> 00:54:03,970
Scott: Whereas here, every single thing you can collect now has a use because of the Fuse ability.

795
00:54:04,310 --> 00:54:09,315
Rym: And I am constantly making specific, like I know I'm going to head into the deep.

796
00:54:09,395 --> 00:54:13,600
Rym: I'm like making weapons and things and preparing for that specific journey.

797
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:23,950
Rym: And they've interlocked all the resource cycles so that like going into the deep, you'll naturally accrue the kinds of things you need to do sky stuff.

798
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:29,190
Rym: And doing sky stuff, you naturally accrue the kinds of things you need to go into the deep and all the loops.

799
00:54:31,116 --> 00:54:32,061
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

800
00:54:32,081 --> 00:54:33,790
Scott: I feel like it's just mixed up all over.

801
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:36,755
Rym: Well, like you get Zoanite mostly in the deep.

802
00:54:36,795 --> 00:54:38,478
Rym: You get charges mostly in the sky.

803
00:54:38,899 --> 00:54:41,403
Rym: Like bomb flowers are in caves and the deep.

804
00:54:41,764 --> 00:54:43,407
Rym: Model blooms are really only in the deep.

805
00:54:43,828 --> 00:54:44,910
Rym: Poes are only down there.

806
00:54:46,451 --> 00:54:50,023
Scott: I mean, you know, but it's not like, you know, you get pose in the deep.

807
00:54:50,063 --> 00:54:51,850
Scott: It's not like you need pose in the sky.

808
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:52,291
Rym: True.

809
00:54:52,533 --> 00:54:54,429
Rym: But like you get bright blooms.

810
00:54:54,851 --> 00:54:57,100
Scott: Things are regional, right?

811
00:54:57,381 --> 00:54:59,970
Scott: So if you want certain things, you have to go to certain regions.

812
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:05,905
Rym: Like those fire fruits are only in places either in the sky or where sky stuff has fallen.

813
00:55:06,065 --> 00:55:07,570
Rym: Like they're not in the rest of the map.

814
00:55:10,271 --> 00:55:11,172
Rym: This game is so good.

815
00:55:11,192 --> 00:55:21,188
Rym: And the last thing they did is I think they kicked up the plot details a little bit compared to recent Zeldas like Breath of the Wild.

816
00:55:21,428 --> 00:55:22,470
Rym: The cutscenes are longer.

817
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:24,413
Scott: Usually Zelda games are sparse.

818
00:55:24,553 --> 00:55:27,617
Scott: Yeah, they're sparse on the explicit plot.

819
00:55:27,637 --> 00:55:30,161
Scott: You don't have cutscenes and dialogue, right?

820
00:55:30,281 --> 00:55:36,650
Scott: It's just sort of like, you know, there might be like someone talks to you a little bit in a town kind of stuff, right?

821
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:43,729
Scott: Or a lot of the plot is just like when you beat a dungeon, the sage of the dungeon will talk to you and tell you, you know, what's going on.

822
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:46,373
Rym: This one has a lot more direct plot.

823
00:55:46,453 --> 00:55:56,444
Rym: Like even in the world, like the Sheikah you're working with and like all the people who are doing stuff, they're all like, oh shit, yeah, like there's some Ganon shit going on.

824
00:55:56,524 --> 00:55:59,187
Rym: So we organized an army to go deal with it.

825
00:55:59,227 --> 00:56:01,310
Rym: And like everyone in the world kind of knows what's going on.

826
00:56:01,890 --> 00:56:04,834
Scott: Yeah, the plot isn't just at the beginning of the game and at the end.

827
00:56:04,994 --> 00:56:08,459
Scott: It's also like it's a developing as the game continues.

828
00:56:08,499 --> 00:56:10,261
Scott: Like things are happening, right?

829
00:56:10,301 --> 00:56:19,513
Scott: Whereas, you know, Breath of the Wild was much more like older Zeldas where at the start they tell you, at least after the tutorial, Then they're like, okay, go beat Ganon when you're ready.

830
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:35,630
Scott: Where the plot is going along as the game goes along.

831
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:37,330
Rym: And not going to, not going to be real.

832
00:56:37,370 --> 00:56:41,614
Scott: They're all these separate plot threads that like the order of all that doesn't matter because it's an open world.

833
00:56:41,634 --> 00:56:42,775
Scott: You can't control the order.

834
00:56:43,155 --> 00:56:45,076
Scott: So they did it in a way where the order doesn't matter.

835
00:56:45,117 --> 00:56:49,800
Scott: You just learn pieces of it as you complete different things, however you complete them.

836
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:05,517
Rym: Ganondorf is like basically there saying he's pledging his support.

837
00:57:05,918 --> 00:57:11,307
Rym: And after he leaves, the whole time you're watching the scene, you're thinking, Zelda, just tell him that's Ganon.

838
00:57:11,327 --> 00:57:12,910
Rym: Like that's obviously Ganon.

839
00:57:13,591 --> 00:57:15,738
Rym: The plot can't be so stupid that no one saw this coming.

840
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:19,230
Rym: As soon as he leaves, Zelda's like, yo, that's Ganon.

841
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:20,717
Rym: And Rowan's like, you think I don't fucking know that?

842
00:57:20,757 --> 00:57:21,561
Rym: That guy's dangerous.

843
00:57:21,601 --> 00:57:23,410
Rym: I'm keeping an eye on him and I might have to kill him.

844
00:57:24,470 --> 00:57:26,833
Rym: Like nobody's stupid in the cutscenes.

845
00:57:26,914 --> 00:57:38,029
Rym: Every time you think there's going to be one of those traditional Zelda plots where people just like don't see the obvious evil thing happening, everybody sees the obvious evil thing happening immediately.

846
00:57:38,269 --> 00:57:38,930
Rym: Nobody's stupid.

847
00:57:39,450 --> 00:57:44,310
Scott: In Ocarina of Time, it's like, you know, Ganon fools the king of Hyrule, just doesn't fool Zelda.

848
00:57:45,010 --> 00:57:48,990
Rym: Ganon doesn't fool anyone in this game except, I guess, the Gerudo.

849
00:57:49,770 --> 00:57:49,931
Scott: Right.

850
00:57:49,951 --> 00:57:50,692
Scott: He doesn't fool them.

851
00:57:50,712 --> 00:57:51,794
Scott: He just he's just like, all right.

852
00:57:51,894 --> 00:57:55,421
Scott: He keeps trying to fool people and he fools stupid people.

853
00:57:55,882 --> 00:58:00,130
Scott: But mostly he's just like, all right, I'll overpower you because I'm super powerful again and deal with it.

854
00:58:00,271 --> 00:58:00,493
Scott: Right.

855
00:58:00,553 --> 00:58:01,441
Scott: And it's like, thank you.

856
00:58:01,522 --> 00:58:02,430
Scott: That's what you should be doing.

857
00:58:02,791 --> 00:58:05,850
Rym: But just the fact that Zelda's like I think he's like a James Bond villain.

858
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:09,158
Scott: He's like he's like a James Bond villain who just shoots Bond.

859
00:58:09,178 --> 00:58:09,679
Scott: Like, bam.

860
00:58:09,739 --> 00:58:11,363
Scott: Yeah, it's like that's Ganon.

861
00:58:11,403 --> 00:58:12,045
Scott: And it's like that's.

862
00:58:12,165 --> 00:58:13,910
Scott: you know, it's a pretty cool Ganon to do that.

863
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:14,311
Scott: Right.

864
00:58:14,672 --> 00:58:21,010
Rym: But the cleverness of this plot and it's it really stuck with me because it was so apparent and I hope everyone saw this.

865
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:24,636
Rym: But because the rough plot is Zelda got sent back in time.

866
00:58:25,076 --> 00:58:32,890
Rym: So like that's your kind of link is literally following the legend of Zelda to save Zelda.

867
00:58:33,811 --> 00:58:35,338
Rym: Like, there it is.

868
00:58:35,358 --> 00:58:37,809
Rym: It's the Legend of Zelda straight up.

869
00:58:40,651 --> 00:58:46,610
Rym: So, yeah, this game is great and I could probably talk forever about specific things I liked about it.

870
00:58:46,810 --> 00:58:53,270
Rym: So I guess something that stood out, the Yiga Clan, at least the part of it I encountered being all Mad Max with their stupid machines is hilarious.

871
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:56,196
Scott: Yeah, they're a lot weaker, I think, than in Breath of the Wild.

872
00:58:56,216 --> 00:58:57,339
Rym: At least so far, yeah.

873
00:58:57,359 --> 00:59:01,110
Rym: They go down like chunks partly because they're in these giant Mad Max looking machines driving around.

874
00:59:01,291 --> 00:59:02,518
Scott: I haven't seen those ones.

875
00:59:02,558 --> 00:59:04,329
Scott: I've just seen ones normal walking around.

876
00:59:04,570 --> 00:59:06,093
Rym: Oh, I found an outpost of theirs.

877
00:59:06,133 --> 00:59:14,730
Rym: Like they built this fort and they surrounded it with Zonai machines and they're like all there driving around with these like electric powered death machines.

878
00:59:15,370 --> 00:59:19,890
Rym: But they kind of don't drive them like shit and they're so easy to beat that it's really funny.

879
00:59:21,070 --> 00:59:25,470
Scott: Yeah, they're definitely branded whereas in the first Breath of the Wild they were kind of strong.

880
00:59:25,630 --> 00:59:26,908
Rym: Now they're kind of Team Rocket-y.

881
00:59:27,672 --> 00:59:29,730
Scott: Yeah, they're very Team Rocket incompetent and goofy.

882
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:44,290
Scott: But I think I do want to say, the point is that the original thing I said, I was skeptical of like you're really going to make a direct sequel and that's not the Nintendo way.

883
00:59:44,830 --> 00:59:48,099
Scott: And it's like no, we really did not disappoint.

884
00:59:48,159 --> 00:59:48,881
Scott: We went all out.

885
00:59:48,921 --> 00:59:52,110
Scott: This is actually an all new, all bigger revolutionary deal.

886
00:59:52,130 --> 01:00:01,570
Rym: But it feels like they really, really studied the response to Breath of the Wild and used that to make this just a better game.

887
01:00:02,551 --> 01:00:04,499
Scott: They kept the same core, right?

888
01:00:04,620 --> 01:00:07,130
Scott: Which is something they usually don't do, right?

889
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:14,196
Scott: They kept the same core, the same basic systems and they just made not an incremental improvement but like.

890
01:00:14,456 --> 01:00:19,340
Scott: they pushed it like several times forward to where it's just truly unbelievable.

891
01:00:19,601 --> 01:00:26,280
Scott: And I wish they would, you know, for the other games, right, where they do keep changing things up, right?

892
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:35,780
Scott: It's like, you know, the other Nintendo games, it's like okay, we did a game, a Mario and now we're going to do a completely different Mario, right?

893
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:38,398
Scott: We weren't satisfied doing the same thing again, right?

894
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:45,640
Scott: It's like come on, do the same thing again and just level it up instead just like you did here, right?

895
01:00:46,422 --> 01:00:52,240
Scott: Take a Super Metroid and just level it up, layer two more maps on top of it and put another, right?

896
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:56,232
Scott: But they don't, you know, I haven't seen them do that.

897
01:00:56,252 --> 01:00:58,520
Scott: Hopefully they'll do it with their other franchises now.

898
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:13,040
Rym: Well considering that this, I think it's safe to say that Tears of the Kingdom is an unmitigated success, like I see no credible criticism of this game except on the most minor details.

899
01:01:14,102 --> 01:01:17,720
Scott: I don't, what criticism, is there a negative thing I can say about this game?

900
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:18,900
Rym: I'm trying to think of anything I would say negative.

901
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:22,060
Scott: Life is too short, life is too short, I don't have time for all this.

902
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:25,860
Rym: Yeah, like I actually do have other things I need to be doing in my life.

903
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:35,400
Scott: There were some duplication cheats that I took advantage of, but now they patched them out, which is like you're really going to expect me to farm all this items.

904
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:41,520
Rym: So I have found so far, I am getting everything I need as I want it without needing to farm anything so far.

905
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:47,459
Scott: Except the main thing you gotta farm for in this one and Breath of the Wild is upgrading your armor all the way, right?

906
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:54,900
Scott: The highest level armor upgrades require like a pile of dragon scales and all sorts of non, you know, diamonds and shit.

907
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:59,320
Rym: Yeah and I probably won't bother with that, like I'm not going to farm anything beyond what is reasonable.

908
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:10,500
Scott: No, but if you were, you don't need it, but the highest level armor upgrades like make you basically, it's like getting the red ring, it's like you don't need it to beat Zelda 1, but boy is that nice to have.

909
01:02:10,622 --> 01:02:11,077
Rym: That is true.

910
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:20,500
Scott: It's like if you're not super skilled at the actiony parts, like if you have the red, you know, if you get the highest level armor, you can just take out a Lynel and get hit a whole bunch and still take them down, right?

911
01:02:20,664 --> 01:02:21,160
Scott: No problem.

912
01:02:21,865 --> 01:02:22,538
Scott: And that's what I want.

913
01:02:23,081 --> 01:02:25,940
Scott: I got a farm, you got a farm to get that, which is- Let's see, what have I done so far?

914
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:27,000
Rym: I got about 30 shrines.

915
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,140
Rym: I haven't done that many shrines.

916
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:31,720
Rym: I am, because Emily got the Master Sword like right away, like way fast.

917
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:34,260
Scott: I definitely got more shrines than, I definitely have more shrines than that.

918
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:35,138
Scott: I must have 50 or 60 shrines.

919
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:39,780
Rym: Yeah, I haven't done that many shrines because my strategy is one, I got two full rings of stamina.

920
01:02:40,142 --> 01:02:44,300
Rym: I took almost no hearts, and I play this game the way I play Breath of the Wild.

921
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:45,659
Rym: Just don't get hit, just be good.

922
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:56,601
Scott: I think I might have 60 something shrines because by my math, I've got the amount of heart containers I've gotten from shrines might be like 16 or 15.

923
01:02:56,601 --> 01:02:59,240
Rym: I've only got like seven hearts because I did all stamina.

924
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:01,300
Scott: Right, so I only get heart containers.

925
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:02,340
Scott: I've never needed another stamina.

926
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:02,960
Scott: You're gonna regret that.

927
01:03:03,583 --> 01:03:03,939
Scott: No, I won't.

928
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:06,319
Rym: Yeah, yeah, I absolutely am sure you're gonna regret that.

929
01:03:06,684 --> 01:03:07,179
Scott: I'll be fine.

930
01:03:07,641 --> 01:03:16,341
Scott: So then, so 15 shrines times 4, or 15 heart containers times 4 is 60.

931
01:03:16,341 --> 01:03:18,410
Rym: I looted Hyrule Castle like right away.

932
01:03:18,470 --> 01:03:20,460
Rym: I also looted one of the labyrinths right away.

933
01:03:21,820 --> 01:03:32,820
Scott: Yeah, I tried to go to a labyrinth, and it was so dangerous at the entrance that I beat the dangerous thing at the entrance, but then I said that was costing me a lot of resources, and it was the entrance, so I'm gonna not go further.

934
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:47,760
Rym: I think the labyrinths are not created, because one thing I've noticed, the game, when they made this game, they definitely remembered the great attractors of the first game, like the things you would go seek out that you'd have a memory of, but they've remixed them all just enough.

935
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:55,820
Rym: So like, you go to one of the labyrinths, because you remember where it was from the first time you played, and it's crazy dangerous, and there's new stuff there.

936
01:03:56,260 --> 01:04:00,597
Rym: But you go to one of the other ones, and it's actually not so bad, and there's like pretty low hanging fruit plot stuff.

937
01:04:00,617 --> 01:04:01,300
Rym: you can just do there.

938
01:04:04,062 --> 01:04:13,735
Scott: Anyway, I mean if you aren't playing this game, and you have a Switch, I don't know what's- This is like- Literally everyone from every walk of video gaming, right?

939
01:04:13,755 --> 01:04:14,759
Scott: Like every single person.

940
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:16,246
Rym: Like all my co-workers are playing it.

941
01:04:16,307 --> 01:04:18,779
Rym: Like everyone is playing it.

942
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:25,360
Scott: But it's like fighting game people, RPG people, puzzle people, it's like everybody.

943
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:36,360
Rym: I'll go as far as to say that Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom alone, just those two games, are enough to require the purchase of a Switch game if you've never played any other Switch game.

944
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:39,124
Scott: I'm just saying, how could they, you know, it's like.

945
01:04:39,245 --> 01:04:48,440
Scott: usually you think of video games, right, even the ones with the broadest appeal, right, as being something that like, yeah, there's people like a certain kind, right?

946
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:49,371
Rym: Yeah, you know what people like?

947
01:04:49,432 --> 01:04:49,999
Rym: Zelda games.

948
01:04:50,662 --> 01:04:56,180
Scott: You don't see fighting game people playing, you know, Starcraft too often or Counter Strike too often, right?

949
01:04:56,280 --> 01:05:01,550
Scott: But it's like they've managed to make this game that like literally like must be.

950
01:05:01,670 --> 01:05:06,219
Scott: every single person who plays video games is playing this game, right?

951
01:05:06,279 --> 01:05:06,900
Scott: Just everybody.

952
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:17,240
Scott: And it's like that in itself, right, forgetting that the game design itself or any of those details, right, but it's just to make a game with such a broad audience.

953
01:05:18,061 --> 01:05:22,571
Scott: It's like to make any art with such a broad audience is, you know, very difficult.

954
01:05:22,591 --> 01:05:25,337
Scott: Can you imagine making a movie or a song that like?

955
01:05:25,357 --> 01:05:26,760
Scott: does everyone fucking love that song?

956
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:34,595
Scott: Whether they were a metalhead or a Taylor Swift fan or a K-pop fan or a rap fan or whatever, and everyone loved this song.

957
01:05:34,695 --> 01:05:37,040
Scott: It's like how hard that would be, but that's what this is.

958
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:51,560
Rym: And these two games, like if you want to make games, if you think you have aspiration to be a game designer someday, like these are two games to just play the hell out of and study and research and like really inspect while you play.

959
01:05:52,100 --> 01:06:02,040
Scott: I think it might actually, I think it might hurt more than it helps because it's like, you know, it's sort of like trying to watch, you know, LeBron to figure out how you're going to play basketball.

960
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:04,424
Rym: But like one thing I'd point out, the graphics aren't that good.

961
01:06:04,464 --> 01:06:09,172
Rym: Like if there's frame stutters, the textures are like ultra simple.

962
01:06:09,472 --> 01:06:13,960
Rym: Things look real quote unquote bad if you get up close to them, except like important plot things.

963
01:06:14,261 --> 01:06:18,560
Rym: And it doesn't matter at all because the game's so good that no one notices that.

964
01:06:19,464 --> 01:06:20,519
Scott: Nope, no one gives a shit.

965
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:24,960
Rym: Meanwhile, you got the people who obsess over making their photorealistic Call of Duty 15 or whatever.

966
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:27,906
Scott: But yeah, someone spends two thousand.

967
01:06:27,946 --> 01:06:30,071
Scott: It's like better value for your money.

968
01:06:30,171 --> 01:06:30,392
Scott: Right.

969
01:06:30,452 --> 01:06:34,180
Scott: Two thousand dollars of GPU to get more frames and Counter-Strike.

970
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:38,652
Rym: Yeah, the Nintendo Switch is a potato compared to even my current video card.

971
01:06:38,732 --> 01:06:41,620
Rym: And yet this game is better than any game I've got on this PC.

972
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:43,871
Scott: What does a Nintendo Switch even cost?

973
01:06:44,052 --> 01:06:44,294
Scott: Right.

974
01:06:44,756 --> 01:06:45,480
Scott: A few hundred bucks.

975
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:45,821
Scott: Yeah.

976
01:06:46,041 --> 01:06:52,118
Rym: For the cost of a PlayStation five, you could get Zelda Tears of the Kingdom, Zelda Breath of the Wild, and a Switch.

977
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:56,567
Scott: An MSRP OLED Switch is 360 and you add 60.

978
01:06:56,567 --> 01:06:57,328
Scott: So 420.

979
01:06:57,328 --> 01:07:03,340
Scott: So for 420, you can get a Switch and Tears of the Kingdom.

980
01:07:04,021 --> 01:07:08,740
Scott: And for four times the price, you can get a GPU with no games and no rest of the computer.

981
01:07:09,206 --> 01:07:10,178
Scott: Or at least the top GPUs.

982
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:16,900
Rym: While you spent years wasting time making photorealistic textures of bathrooms, I studied making a good game.

983
01:07:18,321 --> 01:07:22,852
Scott: Yeah, so somehow they done did it.

984
01:07:23,955 --> 01:07:25,739
Scott: More than, you know.

985
01:07:26,802 --> 01:07:28,413
Rym: I guessed here 11 out of 10.

986
01:07:28,413 --> 01:07:29,460
Rym: I don't know what else I could say.

987
01:07:30,302 --> 01:07:32,328
Scott: I wasn't hyped when they announced it.

988
01:07:32,408 --> 01:07:34,636
Scott: I was like, "Oh, you're just gonna make another one of the same?

989
01:07:34,736 --> 01:07:35,137
Scott: Okay,

990
01:07:35,177 --> 01:07:35,719
Scott: whatever.".

991
01:07:36,141 --> 01:07:36,726
Scott: It's like, "Nope.

992
01:07:37,170 --> 01:07:37,553
Scott: We'll show

993
01:07:37,613 --> 01:07:37,734
Scott: you.".

994
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:38,633
Rym: Yup.

995
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:40,172
Scott: It's like, "You sure showed

996
01:07:40,212 --> 01:07:40,333
Scott: me.".

997
01:07:41,141 --> 01:07:48,880
Rym: I would be hard pressed to name many games that I would say are in any sense of the world better than this game.

998
01:07:50,461 --> 01:07:52,526
Scott: They may be the best video game.

999
01:07:53,348 --> 01:07:58,300
Scott: The best single player video game that has ever been made by anyone ever to this point in history.

1000
01:07:58,360 --> 01:07:58,662
Scott: Yup.

1001
01:07:59,326 --> 01:08:07,380
Rym: Like, I'd struggle to think... Even there are games that might have had better pure experiences, but they're not as big and long as this.

1002
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:12,560
Rym: This is so consistently that for so much gameplay.

1003
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:14,016
Scott: I don't know.

1004
01:08:15,702 --> 01:08:19,319
Rym: I haven't even got all the fucking towers yet and I already got my money's worth.

1005
01:08:20,939 --> 01:08:25,660
Scott: Is it like... I think the list might be like Tears of the Kingdom, Tetris.

1006
01:08:26,881 --> 01:08:29,068
Scott: It's like, what else is there?

1007
01:08:29,148 --> 01:08:29,529
Scott: I don't know.

1008
01:08:29,590 --> 01:08:32,760
Scott: Everything else feels less there in some aspect.

1009
01:08:33,582 --> 01:08:36,238
Scott: Even Super Metroid, which I usually say is the best game.

1010
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:37,863
Rym: Half-Life even?

1011
01:08:38,084 --> 01:08:42,120
Rym: Nah, this game kicks the shit out of Half-Life by most metrics.

1012
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:43,645
Scott: Yeah, nope.

1013
01:08:43,908 --> 01:08:44,514
Scott: It's not good at...

1014
01:08:45,081 --> 01:08:45,202
Rym: Nope.

1015
01:08:45,223 --> 01:08:46,479
Rym: Half-Life was a regular game for all time.

1016
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:49,135
Scott: And we don't even have to wait for the test of time on this one, right?

1017
01:08:49,154 --> 01:08:50,060
Scott: That's how strong it is.

1018
01:08:50,441 --> 01:08:53,549
Scott: Yeah, you know us.

1019
01:08:53,649 --> 01:09:01,099
Rym: We're the kinds of people who will love a game, give it a 10 out of 10, and say, "Maybe in 20 years we can agree that this game deserves to be

1020
01:09:01,118 --> 01:09:01,240
Rym: honest.".

1021
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:05,300
Scott: Well, we learned our lesson from a lot of things that we liked a whole lot earlier in life.

1022
01:09:05,642 --> 01:09:06,978
Scott: Later on, we're like, "Those are just

1023
01:09:06,997 --> 01:09:07,078
Scott: okay.".

1024
01:09:08,381 --> 01:09:11,760
Scott: It's like, I loved the shit out of Trigun, the anime, when it was new.

1025
01:09:11,859 --> 01:09:13,066
Scott: But now it's like, it's good.

1026
01:09:13,086 --> 01:09:15,658
Scott: But it's not like my favorite right now.

1027
01:09:15,779 --> 01:09:15,966
Scott: Yeah.

1028
01:09:18,185 --> 01:09:18,919
Scott: It's like I watched the new one.

1029
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:25,580
Rym: Also, last thing I want to say, that fucking guy and his dubious signs.

1030
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:28,939
Rym: One, never hire that construction company if that's who works for them.

1031
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,639
Scott: No, that's the thing that I think is the funniest.

1032
01:09:32,702 --> 01:09:35,340
Scott: Well, I guess you haven't met the president who's on the sign, have you?

1033
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:35,613
Rym: Nope.

1034
01:09:36,580 --> 01:09:39,071
Scott: Okay, but the construction company is great.

1035
01:09:39,151 --> 01:09:41,220
Scott: It's just that guy who works for them who's a doofus.

1036
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:48,857
Rym: But two, I love that his puzzles are everywhere, but he just gets more and more... It starts like, "Oh, his sign is hard to prop

1037
01:09:48,978 --> 01:09:49,037
Rym: up.".

1038
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:55,040
Rym: A little bit later in the game, it's like the sign just has the barest stick at the bottom.

1039
01:09:55,581 --> 01:09:56,192
Rym: And it's hanging...

1040
01:09:56,660 --> 01:09:58,980
Scott: If it's pointing at the bottom, that's the most annoying one.

1041
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:06,800
Rym: And it is pointing straight off a cliff in the middle of Hebra in the snow with the wind blowing against it.

1042
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:08,765
Rym: Alright, alright.

1043
01:10:08,785 --> 01:10:11,939
Rym: I had to build a whole fucking crane contraption to hold that thing up.

1044
01:10:13,321 --> 01:10:16,119
Scott: Yeah, sometimes I see a Korok and I'm like, "I don't got time for

1045
01:10:16,139 --> 01:10:16,219
Scott: you.".

1046
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:19,399
Scott: But if I see the sign guy, it's like, "Oh, I always got time for

1047
01:10:19,439 --> 01:10:19,520
Scott: that.".

1048
01:10:19,701 --> 01:10:20,147
Rym: Oh, of course.

1049
01:10:20,470 --> 01:10:21,280
Rym: I always do sign guy.

1050
01:10:21,601 --> 01:10:27,440
Rym: Though, the Koroks, now that I'm getting better at making machines, I'm doing the Koroks more instead of coming back to them.

1051
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:33,560
Scott: I do plenty of Koroks, but I'm just saying, when I see a really annoying one and it's not going in my direction, I'm like, "Alright, fuck

1052
01:10:33,580 --> 01:10:33,660
Scott: that.".

1053
01:10:33,660 --> 01:10:34,699
Rym: But I always do sign guy.

1054
01:10:35,741 --> 01:10:35,942
Scott: Yeah.

1055
01:10:36,364 --> 01:10:37,209
Scott: Sign guy.

1056
01:10:37,289 --> 01:10:39,420
Scott: I hope I can do... I will probably do all the sign guy.

1057
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:46,060
Scott: And if I stop finding sign guys, I'll probably do some cheating to get a map of where they are or something.

1058
01:10:46,420 --> 01:10:52,278
Rym: And since Emily got the Master Sword, like, basically immediately, I'm gonna try to get the Master Sword tonight.

1059
01:10:52,318 --> 01:10:52,920
Rym: I'm mostly there.

1060
01:10:54,261 --> 01:10:56,380
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1061
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:01,520
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1062
01:11:01,881 --> 01:11:06,920
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1063
01:11:07,340 --> 01:11:09,847
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1064
01:11:10,007 --> 01:11:14,600
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1066
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:22,470
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1067
01:11:22,671 --> 01:11:25,560
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1068
01:11:25,820 --> 01:11:26,456
Rym: We're back, baby!

1069
01:11:27,061 --> 01:11:44,956

1070
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:49,540
Rym: Probably because you want access to that kinda nice RSS feed.

1071
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:51,527
Rym: But anyway, we're back.

1072
01:11:51,587 --> 01:11:54,520
Rym: We don't anticipate any significant disruptions in the show for a while.

1073
01:11:55,123 --> 01:11:57,112
Rym: And I leave you tonight with...

1074
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:02,672
Media: It was the baby I stole from Randor.

1075
01:12:03,114 --> 01:12:05,080
Media: Princess Adora.

1076
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:07,879
Rym: Princess Adora?

1077
01:12:08,681 --> 01:12:09,482
Media: You remember.

1078
01:12:10,024 --> 01:12:10,685
Media: The baby.

1079
01:12:11,387 --> 01:12:11,768
Media: The baby.

1080
01:12:11,808 --> 01:12:13,693
Media: We broke into the palace that time.

1081
01:12:13,713 --> 01:12:16,640
Media: It was the only time me and you worked together.

1082
01:12:17,363 --> 01:12:19,129
Rym: Yes, I remember.

1083
01:12:19,189 --> 01:12:20,153
Rym: Yes, the baby.

1084
01:12:20,454 --> 01:12:21,678
Rym: Oh, yes, the baby.

1085
01:12:21,799 --> 01:12:22,040
Rym: Yes.

1086
01:12:24,352 --> 01:12:24,539
Rym: What?

1087
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:26,605
Rym: The baby, Skeletor.

1088
01:12:26,665 --> 01:12:27,408
Media: You remember.

1089
01:12:27,468 --> 01:12:28,692
Media: You must remember.

1090
01:12:29,495 --> 01:12:30,720
Media: It was that one time.

1091
01:12:31,860 --> 01:12:38,779
Media: Remember, I was having a hard time with the vehicle, couldn't get the jetpack flying on the... You remember.

1092
01:12:40,144 --> 01:12:42,210
Scott: Oh, yes, the baby.

1093
01:12:42,370 --> 01:12:43,474
Scott: Of course.

1094
01:12:45,078 --> 01:12:45,660
Rym: The baby.

1095
01:12:47,753 --> 01:12:47,939
Media: What?

1096
01:12:48,580 --> 01:12:49,222
Media: The baby.

1097
01:12:49,462 --> 01:12:50,365
Media: Skeletor, think.

1098
01:12:50,967 --> 01:12:51,588
Media: The baby.

1099
01:12:51,669 --> 01:12:52,471
Media: You remember.

1100
01:12:52,832 --> 01:12:55,620
Media: We spent hours looking for a crib.

1101
01:12:56,582 --> 01:12:59,256
Media: We fashioned a crib from ostrich feathers.

1102
01:12:59,517 --> 01:13:00,120
Media: You remember.

1103
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:03,230
Media: We took a little bit of hay in ostrich feathers.

1104
01:13:03,411 --> 01:13:05,299
Media: It was the only time, Skeletor.

1105
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:06,545
Media: Remember?

1106
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:07,778
Media: Remember the milk?

1107
01:13:08,725 --> 01:13:10,819
Media: You remember having to nurse the baby, right?

1108
01:13:12,083 --> 01:13:12,278
Media: What?

1109
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:15,146
Media: Skeletor, it was your plan.

1110
01:13:15,728 --> 01:13:18,014
Media: You drew up the plans in front of me.

1111
01:13:18,055 --> 01:13:19,780
Media: It took like three hours, Skeletor.

1112
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:23,296
Media: Mostly you were just standing there saying, "Take the baby.

1113
01:13:23,376 --> 01:13:23,738
Media: Take the

1114
01:13:23,778 --> 01:13:24,039
Media: baby.".

1115
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:25,684
Scott: Yes, the baby.

1116
01:13:25,764 --> 01:13:26,606
Scott: The baby.

1117
01:13:26,646 --> 01:13:28,150
Scott: Take the baby.

1118
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:31,740
Scott: As long as I live, I will never forget this day.

1119
01:13:32,881 --> 01:13:33,444
Scott: Baby.

1120
01:13:35,194 --> 01:13:35,637
Scott: Babies.

1121
01:13:35,918 --> 01:13:36,079
Media: Yes.

1122
01:13:37,571 --> 01:13:37,833
Media: What?

1123
01:13:37,853 --> 01:13:38,478
Media: Enough!
