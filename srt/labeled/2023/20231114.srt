1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,318
Rym: It's Tuesday, November 14th, 2023.

2
00:00:10,318 --> 00:00:10,619
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,752 --> 00:00:14,230
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:15,497
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,537 --> 00:00:17,750
Rym: Tonight, we're reviewing Cobalt Core.

6
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:19,548
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:32,710
Rym: So, uh, you listen to GeekNights, you know that when we were young, we dabbled in AMD because there was a time when an AMD CPU cost, like, a fifth of an Intel and was faster.

8
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:36,046
Scott: Well, it was basically, you know, the Pentium 3 came out.

9
00:00:36,066 --> 00:00:36,810
Scott: I had a Pentium 3.

10
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,899
Scott: That was the first computer I built, right?

11
00:00:38,959 --> 00:00:42,531
Scott: Not the first one I owned, but the first one I built was Pentium 3.

12
00:00:42,531 --> 00:00:52,790
Scott: And then, you know, when that became, when that was running its course and was ready for it to be replaced, you looked around at the world and there were Pentium 4s, which are very, very expensive, first of all.

13
00:00:53,374 --> 00:00:54,290
Scott: And not that fast.

14
00:00:55,811 --> 00:00:59,910
Scott: Uh, well, you know, there was lots of, you know, they were pretty fast, relatively speaking.

15
00:01:00,091 --> 00:01:04,030
Scott: But there was, basically, it's like, what were you getting for your money?

16
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:07,750
Scott: It was not a good price performance ratio, right?

17
00:01:08,451 --> 00:01:14,714
Scott: And, meanwhile, AMD was out there with all these Athlon CPUs that were actually like, "Hey, they work.

18
00:01:15,296 --> 00:01:18,568
Scott: They're way cheaper in terms of the performance you

19
00:01:18,588 --> 00:01:18,789
Scott: get.".

20
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:21,229
Scott: And pretty much everyone was all in on them.

21
00:01:21,871 --> 00:01:25,270
Rym: Yeah, it was right when, it was the case, because the K6s were, like, not quite there.

22
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:32,489
Rym: The K7s were, that was like 800 megahertz, 900 megahertz, breaking the gigahertz barrier with that Thunderbird like a little while later.

23
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:34,729
Scott: Yeah, and it's like, yeah, okay.

24
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:39,790
Scott: And, you know, people were, you know, you could get the AMD video cards, but I didn't.

25
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,630
Scott: I stuck with the Nvidia ones, but it's like the AMD CPUs.

26
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:46,069
Scott: It's like everything worked just normally with them.

27
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:50,069
Scott: There wasn't, you know, so that's what we went with in those days.

28
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:59,990
Scott: Until, like, you know, the mid-2000s-ish, when Intel, when Geeknight started, and they came out with, like, core duos, and they, you know, and that sort of thing.

29
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,830
Scott: That's when we stopped using those.

30
00:02:03,054 --> 00:02:04,869
Scott: And the one thing is, like, yeah, did they work?

31
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,970
Scott: You know, yeah, when they worked, they worked, right?

32
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,704
Scott: But, it's like...

33
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:10,892
Rym: Very telling.

34
00:02:11,273 --> 00:02:19,149
Rym: Every AMD thing I ever had didn't post successfully the first time I tried to turn it on, and then I had to fuss with it, and then it worked.

35
00:02:19,733 --> 00:02:22,569
Rym: Every Intel I've ever had posted the first time.

36
00:02:23,691 --> 00:02:24,150
Rym: Without exception.

37
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,910
Scott: Yeah, but, in my experience, which is not data, we know, it's just anecdotes, right?

38
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:42,370
Scott: There were reliability issues in the early 2000s, when I was using those AMDs, and the one AMD video card we did have lying around, for some strange reason, that we put in the earliest busted HCDC.

39
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,650
Rym: We couldn't get the S-video out to work on Linux.

40
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,870
Scott: Yeah, it was, it just, like, didn't work properly, right?

41
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:55,770
Scott: But, you know, in the experience that I personally had, every time that I used Intel and NVIDIA things, they worked.

42
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:07,650
Scott: You know, there might have been other issues around, you know, even my computers are not 100% perfect, there's always some tiny issue, but I have the least issues of anyone I know when it comes to computers and technology.

43
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:15,510
Rym: I have to say, my current computer, which is pushing, like, this is a sixth generation Intel, and it's still basically perfect.

44
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:30,269
Scott: Yeah, and so we've entered another era now, where people, nerds especially, are again going towards AMD, and their price-performance ratios, and even AMD video cards, right?

45
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,096
Scott: And it's like, do they work?

46
00:03:32,377 --> 00:03:35,130
Scott: It's like, clearly, they work when they work, right?

47
00:03:35,551 --> 00:03:48,125
Scott: But, again, anecdotally, not based on data or benchmarks or any sort of anything like that, just anecdotally, the people I know who have AMD equipment have some issues.

48
00:03:48,487 --> 00:03:49,570
Scott: They have issues, right?

49
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:59,779
Rym: So, some friends of ours, a friend of ours just got, like, a new AMD setup and talking to the other AMD people about, like, what to get, and there's a Discord thread that is very long.

50
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:17,410
Rym: of all the fucking problems they had, like, trying to get it to work the way they wanted, that was very funny, and simultaneously, I haven't even been playing Overwatch the other day, and in the middle of the match, like, someone on my team just disconnects, like, fuck, we're gonna lose now, like, we're screwed.

51
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:31,320
Rym: And, like, we lose the game because a player's out for a minute, but they came back, and they're like, sorry, my game crashed, and I'm just like, why do you have an AMD GPU?

52
00:04:31,882 --> 00:04:35,030
Rym: And this kid responds, like, how did you know I have an AMD?

53
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,948
Scott: Well, first of all, it's a one out of two chance of guessing, right?

54
00:04:39,391 --> 00:04:41,589
Scott: It's already a 50/50 of guessing correctly.

55
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:59,089
Rym: But I'd say it's a little better than 50/50 because my anecdotal, again, just pure anecdotes, everyone I know who has problems with Overwatch has an AMD, and when I Googled for it, found a bunch of Reddit threads that people have in trouble with AMD, didn't find anything about any GTX whatever video card.

56
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:14,470
Scott: Right, well, I mean, it could be this conspiracy theory talk, right, but there's some truth to it, in that I know, for a fact, from things I've heard and seen, that game developers, game engine makers work closely with AMD and Nvidia.

57
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:14,911
Scott: Oh, our

58
00:05:14,991 --> 00:05:35,930
Rym: own friends, when we were, you and I were accused of, like, talking from experience and not from industry perspective around our favoritism toward Nvidia, and one of our very, like, skilled game developer friends directly said, no, they're not wrong, we mostly focus on Nvidia, and Nvidia mostly doesn't have problems.

59
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:44,270
Scott: Right, but I'm not talking about, like, game developers focusing on Nvidia, I'm talking about actual direct working with business relationships, right?

60
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:48,530
Scott: I know for a fact the Nvidia driver contains lots of code.

61
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,369
Rym: Lots of, if Call of Duty, do this.

62
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:58,610
Scott: Exactly, it literally has code exactly like that, like, if the game that is being played is this, do this.

63
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:05,950
Scott: Like, they work that closely with AAA game developers especially when there's issues to make sure that their shit works perfectly.

64
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:12,230
Scott: I'm sure AMD also does that to some extent, but it could be, right, you know, and this is the conspiracy theory part.

65
00:06:12,411 --> 00:06:14,047
Rym: Well, they're not doing a great job of it if they are.

66
00:06:14,771 --> 00:06:31,170
Scott: Well, I'm sure it could be, and this is conspiracy theory talk again, that Nvidia does that so well, right, to such an extent that it's, like, anti-competitive behavior to where sort of the fix is in, in that shit will work with them and not with AMD.

67
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:45,870
Scott: Not because of hardware inferiority or anything like that, but simply out of just that's how it is, because you work so closely with me, we made sure our shit worked perfectly, and we didn't test it so much with their shit, and that's the problem.

68
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:53,130
Scott: It's not actually something AMD did, it's just something there wasn't as many resources put into that.

69
00:06:53,270 --> 00:07:12,010
Rym: Also, an aside, every game developer I know who does, like, coding and heavy work, regardless of, like, what the company does and, like, what relationships they have with the industry, their own gaming PCs, they religiously have Nvidia and Intel.

70
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:30,829
Scott: Yeah, I mean, that's the thing, it's like, you know, even if, you know, they're not working with Nvidia or targeting it or thinking about it, right, the vast majority of game makers' computers have Nvidia boards in them, right, you're not, they're not, and so the result of that is just going to be that sort of.

71
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:38,230
Scott: naturally, that's what is going to be optimized for, right, because they're optimizing it for the computer that they're using.

72
00:07:39,411 --> 00:07:45,025
Scott: And so, it's like, if, you know, if that's the case, it's like, yeah, is AMD actually inferior?

73
00:07:45,045 --> 00:07:57,170
Scott: They're giving you that better price-performance ratio, but in terms of your real-world computing, gaming, it's like, you're going to pay more for the Nvidia, you're going to get the stability and the reliability.

74
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:22,050
Scott: And now, if you're short on money or you enjoy messing with your broken computer or breaking your computer on purpose and breaking shit that, you know, it ain't broke, just because you like fixing it and then complaining even though you're the one who broke it or whatever, it's like, you know, you just like to look at numbers and your benchmarks and not actually use your computer to do anything, you just like playing with your computer for no purpose.

75
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:22,808
Rym: Yeah, it's funny.

76
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:39,001
Scott: Okay, go and get an AMD hardware, but if you're someone who is using your computer as a tool to accomplish tasks and to create things and to do things, you, the highest priority should be your computer works.

77
00:08:39,342 --> 00:08:42,030
Scott: You care if your benchmark number is bigger, right?

78
00:08:42,311 --> 00:08:44,195
Scott: I need a computer that is on.

79
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:51,310
Scott: If it renders the video in 30 seconds and crashes at the 29th second, I'd rather have it render in two minutes and not crash.

80
00:08:52,170 --> 00:09:09,010
Scott: So, if you got the money, even after all these years, you know, argue, provide data or whatever, but I'm still anti-AMD based on, you know, pure anecdotal data.

81
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:18,670
Rym: I mean, my workstation, partly because losing an episode of GeekNights that we've recorded is the worst fucking thing on earth.

82
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:24,145
Rym: Like, that is, that, the few times it happened, that was like being punched right, right in the heart.

83
00:09:24,426 --> 00:09:25,690
Rym: It was, it was just awful.

84
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:30,315
Rym: This computer is like eight years old that I'm making GeekNights on.

85
00:09:30,355 --> 00:09:39,490
Rym: And when I made it, my only mission was to make it last as long as possible without having to ever open it or do anything to it at all.

86
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:42,539
Rym: I wanted it to just work for as long as possible.

87
00:09:42,599 --> 00:09:46,170
Rym: And I put a lot of time and effort into building a computer that would just work.

88
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:50,037
Rym: And here I am in the year 2023 with an i7-6700K, and it is still perfect other than Adobe Creative Cloud.

89
00:09:57,011 --> 00:09:58,149
Scott: Windows 11 doesn't support it.

90
00:09:58,210 --> 00:09:59,933
Rym: Windows 11 doesn't support it for no good reason.

91
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:10,710
Rym: But also, I encountered my first bottleneck that mattered, that was the CPU, and it is a game you might have heard of called Adobe Lightroom.

92
00:10:12,032 --> 00:10:16,550
Rym: The new Lightroom cannot work appropriately.

93
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:29,549
Scott: Lightroom is a little bit slow on my 8700K here, but I think what I'm going to do, I think I've decided, right, is they got the new MacBook M3, and I'm like, all right, this is what, you know, I was planning on computer next year, right?

94
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:33,965
Scott: But Apple came and they're like, aha, we're coming at you months early.

95
00:10:34,005 --> 00:10:35,350
Scott: And I'm like, why you do this, right?

96
00:10:36,693 --> 00:10:43,370
Scott: But I'm just going to buy, you know, the craziest one, obviously not the 16-inch one, the smaller one, right?

97
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:53,210
Scott: But the fastest processor one, and not the most RAM they sell, because they really, and not the most storage, but, you know, enough, right?

98
00:10:54,172 --> 00:10:56,990
Scott: I'll pay for some ridiculously overpriced upgrades.

99
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:03,270
Rym: I think I just saw an article on Waypo that argued that the way Apple charges for RAM might arguably be illegal.

100
00:11:04,011 --> 00:11:04,492
Scott: It should be.

101
00:11:04,933 --> 00:11:05,654
Scott: It really should be.

102
00:11:06,936 --> 00:11:16,370
Scott: It's really heinous because, like, seriously, you can buy like, you know, like 64 gigabytes of RAM on sticks for like, you know, hundreds.

103
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:18,340
Rym: And even the argument of, oh, but it's ECC.

104
00:11:18,421 --> 00:11:20,070
Rym: ECC is not that much more expensive.

105
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:22,637
Scott: I don't think it's, no, it's, I don't think it's ECC at all.

106
00:11:22,737 --> 00:11:27,210
Scott: I think what it, I don't think it is, but it is, it is integrated RAM.

107
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:31,502
Scott: It's like, it's not, you know, replaceable, you know, it's the same stuff.

108
00:11:31,602 --> 00:11:34,250
Scott: It's just, it's, you know, it's like, it's right next to the chip.

109
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,654
Scott: So it's not exactly identical.

110
00:11:35,734 --> 00:11:39,845
Scott: It does justify some markup, but not a 300% markup.

111
00:11:39,885 --> 00:11:41,610
Scott: And the storage is even more criminal.

112
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:48,250
Rym: Apple stops using ECC with Intel processors that aren't Xeon, according to the internet.

113
00:11:49,491 --> 00:11:50,877
Scott: Yeah.

114
00:11:51,781 --> 00:11:52,163
Scott: Let me see.

115
00:11:52,183 --> 00:11:53,508
Scott: I think I wrote it down here.

116
00:11:57,332 --> 00:11:57,633
Scott: Okay.

117
00:11:57,813 --> 00:11:59,296
Scott: So yeah.

118
00:11:59,496 --> 00:12:06,808
Scott: You can buy a Samsung 990 Pro M2 SSD with four terabytes of storage for under $300, right?

119
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:17,250
Scott: To upgrade, right, an M3 Mac, Macbook Pro that just came out, they default to one terabyte of storage.

120
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:23,504
Scott: If you want to upgrade them two from one to four, so you're adding three terabytes, right?

121
00:12:23,524 --> 00:12:25,950
Scott: You're adding three, you're not buying four, you're adding three.

122
00:12:27,431 --> 00:12:28,313
Scott: They will charge you $1,000.

123
00:12:28,313 --> 00:12:32,701
Scott: So that's a 300% markup versus just buying M2 drives that are $300 each.

124
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:43,295
Scott: Yeah, it's definitely a criminal markup.

125
00:12:44,256 --> 00:12:47,580
Scott: But, you know, that is what it is.

126
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:55,870
Scott: So what I'm going to attempt, and I guess I can always return it, but I think this will, I think this will work out because it's still, you know, we talk about Intel.

127
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,275
Scott: It's like, I've used the Apple M chip at work.

128
00:12:59,455 --> 00:13:02,639
Scott: now for, you know, since the M2 Air came out.

129
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:10,870
Scott: And it's like this little thin, tiny wafer thing here is by far the fastest computer in the house.

130
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,472
Scott: And it's not even remotely close.

131
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:15,456
Scott: It doesn't even have fans in it.

132
00:13:15,917 --> 00:13:16,177
Scott: Right.

133
00:13:16,437 --> 00:13:25,850
Scott: So it's like you basically, if you can justify it by saying, all right, the, the, the, the, the upcharge on the storage and the RAM.

134
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:33,002
Scott: It's basically just sort of subsidized by the CPU, which is absolutely insane that they have over there.

135
00:13:33,943 --> 00:13:37,810
Scott: But what I'm going to do is I'm going to get that and use that for all my computing biz.

136
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:38,490
Scott: Right.

137
00:13:38,891 --> 00:13:42,720
Scott: The iPad Pro I have, I think is going to not be supported in a year.

138
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:47,290
Scott: And I'll just sort of let it fade and I won't replace it because I'll have a MacBook.

139
00:13:47,691 --> 00:13:47,871
Scott: Right.

140
00:13:47,992 --> 00:13:49,054
Scott: It's the same purpose.

141
00:13:49,555 --> 00:13:54,446
Scott: And then this computer that's five, six years old now, I'm not going to get rid of it.

142
00:13:54,606 --> 00:13:56,270
Scott: I'm going to use steam stream.

143
00:13:58,031 --> 00:13:58,231
Scott: Right.

144
00:13:58,251 --> 00:14:01,759
Scott: And just keep it over in the corner there with just power and network cable.

145
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,244
Scott: And then, oh, look, I can play all the games still.

146
00:14:04,364 --> 00:14:07,370
Scott: There's nothing I can't do because I still have a Windows computer in the corner.

147
00:14:07,851 --> 00:14:10,935
Scott: I just don't actually need to, you know, use it directly.

148
00:14:11,856 --> 00:14:22,390
Scott: And if I ever reach a point where I want to play some games and they either don't run on Mac or don't run on this old Windows computer, then I'll get a new Windows computer.

149
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:25,435
Scott: That's just basically a video card in a box.

150
00:14:25,716 --> 00:14:25,976
Scott: Right.

151
00:14:26,056 --> 00:14:28,520
Scott: And as small as possible, cram it in a corner.

152
00:14:28,921 --> 00:14:31,826
Scott: And again, use the steam stream situation.

153
00:14:32,367 --> 00:14:34,170
Scott: And I think this, this plan is going to work.

154
00:14:34,591 --> 00:14:35,352
Scott: And you know what?

155
00:14:35,933 --> 00:14:38,177
Scott: If the plan doesn't work, I can change.

156
00:14:38,217 --> 00:14:40,100
Scott: I could do a new plan in five years.

157
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:43,306
Scott: I could always, even if I can't return the Mac, I wait too long.

158
00:14:43,747 --> 00:14:45,169
Scott: I'll be able to sell it, I think.

159
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:45,510
Scott: Right.

160
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:46,010
Scott: Yeah.

161
00:14:46,671 --> 00:14:50,135
Rym: And if the plan works, like maybe I'll go down a similar road.

162
00:14:50,175 --> 00:14:50,535
Rym: We'll see.

163
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:06,933
Scott: But it's literally my primary computer.

164
00:15:06,993 --> 00:15:10,817
Scott: It's not like the side, like you have a laptop, it's like a side laptop.

165
00:15:10,837 --> 00:15:11,437
Scott: But like before

166
00:15:11,457 --> 00:15:24,410
Rym: it repacks, I open that laptop and I like download a PDF of the panel and download the video of the pre-roll, like the open it, the walk-in stuff and like synchronize it and do some Windows updates because I really only use the thing at cons and work travel.

167
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:28,899
Scott: It's like, no, this will be my main computer, the primary one that does all the things.

168
00:15:28,979 --> 00:15:29,199
Scott: Right.

169
00:15:29,239 --> 00:15:31,985
Scott: And this other Windows computer will have steam on it.

170
00:15:32,526 --> 00:15:34,730
Scott: And that's it pretty much mostly.

171
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:45,770
Rym: So anyway, in some news, when Scott sent me a link to this and we didn't talk about it because we skipped shows for a while, all he said was, this is a very geek night story.

172
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,181
Scott: There's a lot of geek night stories.

173
00:15:47,382 --> 00:15:48,149
Scott: I say that a lot.

174
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:48,711
Scott: You do.

175
00:15:48,812 --> 00:15:55,550
Rym: But this one is like hyper geek nights and crosses almost every intersection of everything we talk about in games.

176
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,088
Scott: We got a few of those tonight.

177
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:57,670
Rym: Yep.

178
00:15:58,091 --> 00:16:09,404
Rym: So this article on patch is titled pickleball brawl players hash out gripes anti-Semitism on Upper East Side courts.

179
00:16:09,604 --> 00:16:14,710
Rym: And what this boils down to, to summarize, you're not aware there's a sport called pickleball.

180
00:16:15,051 --> 00:16:17,836
Rym: Now, you might think it's new, but it's not.

181
00:16:17,896 --> 00:16:19,439
Rym: This is a sport from the 70s.

182
00:16:20,862 --> 00:16:24,710
Rym: It has come and gone in waves of fad.

183
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:31,290
Rym: Like right now, like in the late 80s and early 90s, pickleball was huge and then it disappeared and now it's back.

184
00:16:31,711 --> 00:16:33,600
Rym: So it comes and goes in waves.

185
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,544
Rym: It's not new.

186
00:16:34,644 --> 00:16:35,770
Rym: It's been around for a long time.

187
00:16:36,251 --> 00:16:48,990
Rym: And if I had to describe it, if you don't know what pickleball is, it's basically tennis, but it removes most of the requirements for athleticism and focuses more like it's a different kind.

188
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:53,190
Rym: It's the same kind of game, but like you don't have to be super fit to be really good.

189
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:56,730
Scott: It's basically in between ping pong and tennis, but slower.

190
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:00,790
Rym: I'd argue ping pong requires way more physical skill.

191
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:01,880
Scott: I'm talking about size.

192
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:02,810
Scott: Size wise.

193
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:03,925
Rym: Size wise.

194
00:17:03,946 --> 00:17:04,050
Rym: Yeah.

195
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:08,349
Scott: It's smaller than a tennis court, but bigger than a ping pong.

196
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:15,250
Rym: Well, it was originally designed to be playable on like a tennis court, but you play like just in part of the tennis court.

197
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:16,011
Scott: Yeah.

198
00:17:16,232 --> 00:17:19,386
Scott: It's a little bit sort of like playing wiffle ball, but like wiffle tennis, right?

199
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:20,270
Scott: Because it's slower.

200
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:26,569
Rym: When I was in middle school and high school, it was the kind of game that like gym classes would just make all the kids play and nobody liked it.

201
00:17:27,151 --> 00:17:27,330
Scott: Yeah.

202
00:17:27,351 --> 00:17:35,010
Scott: But I mean, it's, you know, on the one hand, I'm not going to say like, oh, it's, it's as, you know, I guess good by whatever measure.

203
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:35,311
Scott: Right.

204
00:17:35,371 --> 00:17:45,010
Scott: It's like, you know, this isn't like if you're the champion of pickleball, that's not like a great accomplishment because be, you know, being really good at that is not as hard as being good.

205
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:49,950
Rym: It's like the difference between being really good at a console FPS versus being really good at Counter Strike.

206
00:17:50,712 --> 00:17:50,913
Scott: Right.

207
00:17:50,973 --> 00:17:53,550
Scott: It's like, you know, it's, it's not as difficult.

208
00:17:53,670 --> 00:18:06,190
Scott: But as a sport for people to play recreationally, it's, it's great that this exists because it gives people who aren't, you know, it's like, would you rather have all the old people sitting around, you know, tennis is too hard for the old people.

209
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:06,611
Scott: Right.

210
00:18:06,692 --> 00:18:09,490
Scott: It's like better they play pickleball than nothing.

211
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:09,891
Scott: Yeah.

212
00:18:09,931 --> 00:18:10,111
Scott: Right.

213
00:18:10,212 --> 00:18:16,186
Rym: And I get it to be clear, like, I don't want to imply that I think pickleball is bad in any way in anything we're about to talk about.

214
00:18:16,226 --> 00:18:17,950
Rym: Pickleball is fine.

215
00:18:18,251 --> 00:18:19,013
Rym: It's a game.

216
00:18:19,454 --> 00:18:20,135
Rym: It's a sport.

217
00:18:20,576 --> 00:18:21,078
Rym: Go nuts.

218
00:18:21,318 --> 00:18:22,902
Rym: Nothing wrong with pickleball.

219
00:18:23,343 --> 00:18:26,070
Scott: However, just so you know what it is, it's it's easy tennis.

220
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:29,597
Scott: And I also I do not that I would be any good at it.

221
00:18:29,637 --> 00:18:29,818
Scott: Right.

222
00:18:29,878 --> 00:18:31,924
Scott: I don't want someone to come and say, oh, you said it's easy.

223
00:18:31,964 --> 00:18:32,847
Scott: Well, let's see you play.

224
00:18:32,887 --> 00:18:34,050
Scott: It's like, no, I'm terrible.

225
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:35,912
Scott: I'm so bad.

226
00:18:35,932 --> 00:18:37,494
Scott: I can't do ping pong tennis.

227
00:18:37,895 --> 00:18:39,177
Scott: Maybe I could do bad.

228
00:18:39,197 --> 00:18:44,686
Rym: And if the other person is, it's partly funny that the people who are really into it right now are acting like it is like they keep.

229
00:18:44,746 --> 00:18:45,587
Rym: all the stories are.

230
00:18:45,647 --> 00:18:47,370
Rym: it's the fastest growing sport in America.

231
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:53,101
Rym: And while that is it is technically true, it has been the fastest growing sport in America at multiple points in the past.

232
00:18:53,161 --> 00:18:53,983
Rym: And then it disappeared.

233
00:18:54,283 --> 00:18:55,927
Scott: So it's been.

234
00:18:55,967 --> 00:18:56,427
Scott: I think it's.

235
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:57,690
Scott: it's got some staying power.

236
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:58,732
Scott: It does.

237
00:18:58,852 --> 00:19:07,849
Rym: But any game that gets popular, that is competitive, runs into every problem we have talked about on GeekNights for the last 18 years.

238
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:14,518
Rym: So now there is big drama around pickleball like I couldn't even.

239
00:19:14,538 --> 00:19:23,110
Scott: Well, the fundamental problem is that unlike other sports, right, tennis ish sports and pickleball also require space.

240
00:19:23,691 --> 00:19:28,500
Scott: And it's a lot of space for a very small number of players at a time.

241
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:28,740
Scott: Right.

242
00:19:28,821 --> 00:19:29,862
Scott: A whole tennis court.

243
00:19:30,103 --> 00:19:32,768
Scott: You can have just like two people, maybe four, maybe four.

244
00:19:33,329 --> 00:19:33,870
Scott: And that's it.

245
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:34,190
Scott: Right.

246
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:38,958
Scott: It's like that same space could have a basketball court with 10 people playing.

247
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:39,379
Scott: Yeah.

248
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:39,820
Scott: Right.

249
00:19:40,921 --> 00:19:44,006
Scott: That same space could have like a mini soccer field.

250
00:19:44,367 --> 00:19:44,727
Scott: Right.

251
00:19:44,908 --> 00:19:46,290
Scott: With with a lot of people playing.

252
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:49,094
Rym: Meanwhile, the other the far extreme of that is golf.

253
00:19:50,577 --> 00:19:51,198
Scott: Yes, golf.

254
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:57,669
Scott: But but the thing is, even though one golf hole could have like, you know, can still have maybe eight people.

255
00:19:57,929 --> 00:19:58,230
Scott: Right.

256
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:58,611
Scott: Yeah.

257
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:04,180
Rym: But count the number of acres versus the number of humans actively playing the game at one time.

258
00:20:04,641 --> 00:20:07,445
Scott: Right now, in New York City, space is at a premium.

259
00:20:07,486 --> 00:20:10,170
Scott: It's not like the suburbs where you can play pickleball, no problem.

260
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:15,059
Scott: So with the result of that, the suburbs, you can't play pickleball, no problem anymore.

261
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,282
Rym: I found a bunch of other articles.

262
00:20:16,302 --> 00:20:19,790
Rym: There's big drama in the suburbs, too, because depends on how crowded the sub.

263
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:22,194
Rym: Well, most suburbs have like.

264
00:20:22,314 --> 00:20:31,530
Rym: there's tennis courts around like if you live in suburban America, there are just random tennis courts like at high schools, in apartment complexes, like next to them in parks.

265
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:34,473
Rym: And they're very usually just free and can just play on them.

266
00:20:35,054 --> 00:20:36,316
Rym: And it's not really a big deal.

267
00:20:36,776 --> 00:20:48,090
Rym: But the drama in most of these suburbs over the last year is that the tennis courts that were moderately used, but like weren't a crunch are suddenly completely filled with pickleball people.

268
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:52,776
Rym: So one, the tennis players can't play tennis because people are playing pickleball pickleball on the tennis courts.

269
00:20:53,236 --> 00:20:56,520
Rym: And two, the pickleball people, there's way more of them.

270
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:01,526
Rym: And they're all mad because no one's organizing the line or enforcing the rules.

271
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:04,330
Rym: they're making up over how long anyone gets to play in this free place.

272
00:21:04,911 --> 00:21:05,172
Scott: Yeah.

273
00:21:05,232 --> 00:21:06,935
Scott: Well, so that's the thing in New York City.

274
00:21:07,135 --> 00:21:07,356
Scott: Right.

275
00:21:07,436 --> 00:21:14,690
Scott: When we have a space constraint, they devised a system of permits for tennis, tennis permit in New York City.

276
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:25,430
Scott: If you want to play any minutes or you have a membership at the Racquet Club, but you're there by a private tennis court or you pay a hundred bucks to get like you want to play tennis on a public tennis court.

277
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:28,094
Scott: You need a permit in a New York City park.

278
00:21:28,395 --> 00:21:28,595
Scott: Right.

279
00:21:28,695 --> 00:21:31,199
Scott: And there's a reason that they had that system of permits.

280
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:37,630
Scott: And, you know, people watching the courts was because that sport has a lot of space dedicated to a few people.

281
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:44,210
Scott: And when demand exceeds the acreage available, they need to do some rationing.

282
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:50,650
Rym: It's the same problem that is solved in arcades by people putting quarters on the rim of the DDR machine.

283
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:51,891
Scott: Exactly.

284
00:21:51,971 --> 00:22:03,690
Scott: So here we have a situation, though, with pickleball is somebody set up some pickleball courts right in a public place and basically with their own private equipment.

285
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:08,350
Scott: Nonetheless, they're just letting the public use it just out of the generousness of their own heart.

286
00:22:09,011 --> 00:22:11,159
Scott: This guy comes every day, sets up the nets.

287
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:11,801
Scott: Right.

288
00:22:11,941 --> 00:22:14,310
Scott: And at the end of the day, he takes them home and he lets everyone play.

289
00:22:14,912 --> 00:22:16,478
Scott: But there is no.

290
00:22:16,498 --> 00:22:19,690
Scott: this is not official in any way, shape or form.

291
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:20,373
Scott: Right.

292
00:22:20,433 --> 00:22:22,202
Scott: There is no permitting system.

293
00:22:22,604 --> 00:22:23,650
Scott: It's on public land.

294
00:22:24,954 --> 00:22:28,770
Scott: And it's like no one really has a problem with the land being used that way.

295
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:29,171
Scott: Right.

296
00:22:29,332 --> 00:22:30,475
Scott: You know, it's a public park.

297
00:22:30,596 --> 00:22:35,070
Scott: Most people want to play pickleball versus the other things that were being done in that park.

298
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:39,530
Rym: But the pickleball people are fighting with the other pickleball people over how pickleball is going to go down.

299
00:22:40,173 --> 00:22:40,535
Scott: Exactly.

300
00:22:40,555 --> 00:22:42,243
Scott: There's no official system.

301
00:22:42,384 --> 00:22:43,630
Scott: It's a. it's a public park.

302
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,154
Scott: Everyone has a right to be there.

303
00:22:45,596 --> 00:22:50,050
Scott: But you have spaces that are only limited to a few people at a time.

304
00:22:50,472 --> 00:22:54,210
Scott: And there's no official rationing system or anything in place whatsoever.

305
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:55,653
Rym: Arcades have the same problem.

306
00:22:55,693 --> 00:23:00,990
Rym: Like that system in quotes where people would put their token on the DDR machine to take their turn.

307
00:23:01,771 --> 00:23:03,621
Rym: No cop is enforcing that.

308
00:23:03,741 --> 00:23:05,410
Rym: Like you could just go up and play.

309
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:06,775
Rym: And unless sometimes.

310
00:23:07,036 --> 00:23:07,196
Scott: Yeah.

311
00:23:07,216 --> 00:23:10,950
Scott: But sometimes people just ignore that system and fights in the arcade.

312
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:11,771
Rym: Exactly.

313
00:23:12,714 --> 00:23:19,630
Rym: Because the same reason why if a convention, you know, a nerd con says you can't line up for the autograph thing until four hours before.

314
00:23:20,131 --> 00:23:20,894
Rym: Then what happens?

315
00:23:21,215 --> 00:23:23,041
Rym: A bunch of people don't line up.

316
00:23:23,262 --> 00:23:25,670
Rym: They form a mob where the line is going to happen.

317
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:26,111
Scott: Right.

318
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:32,910
Scott: If you're playing Street Fighter in the arcade and there's a general rule of loser walks, that's the socially accepted rule.

319
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,475
Scott: But it's not an enforced rule.

320
00:23:34,957 --> 00:23:38,910
Scott: If I lose and I just put a quarter in and keep playing, what are you going to punch me?

321
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:39,731
Scott: Right.

322
00:23:39,771 --> 00:23:41,059
Scott: You'll be the one to go to jail.

323
00:23:41,099 --> 00:23:41,844
Scott: You can't stop me.

324
00:23:41,864 --> 00:23:42,769
Scott: You got to call the cops.

325
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:43,853
Rym: Cops don't give a shit.

326
00:23:43,913 --> 00:23:45,941
Rym: Nor have you broken any law or rule.

327
00:23:46,624 --> 00:23:46,784
Scott: Right.

328
00:23:46,804 --> 00:23:48,370
Scott: It's like, what's the owner of the arcade going to do?

329
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,053
Scott: They don't give a fuck.

330
00:23:49,133 --> 00:23:50,017
Scott: I put my quarter in.

331
00:23:50,057 --> 00:23:50,740
Scott: It's my play.

332
00:23:50,881 --> 00:23:51,102
Scott: Yeah.

333
00:23:51,122 --> 00:23:51,302
Scott: Right.

334
00:23:51,383 --> 00:23:52,126
Scott: I'm standing here.

335
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:52,930
Scott: You can't move me.

336
00:23:53,351 --> 00:23:53,551
Scott: Right.

337
00:23:53,652 --> 00:23:57,203
Scott: It's like I wouldn't recommend behaving in the way I just described.

338
00:23:57,263 --> 00:23:59,470
Scott: I would recommend following the social convention.

339
00:24:00,111 --> 00:24:01,334
Scott: But that's a thing.

340
00:24:01,435 --> 00:24:01,595
Scott: Right.

341
00:24:01,876 --> 00:24:07,910
Scott: It's not a real rule the way that, yeah, if you don't have the tennis permit in New York City, yeah, the police will come.

342
00:24:08,751 --> 00:24:08,891
Scott: Right.

343
00:24:08,951 --> 00:24:10,916
Scott: And make you stop playing tennis eventually.

344
00:24:10,957 --> 00:24:11,277
Scott: Right.

345
00:24:11,518 --> 00:24:16,270
Rym: So arcade people can sort out the DDR machine, but the pickleball people don't seem to be able to sort out pickleball.

346
00:24:17,111 --> 00:24:17,271
Scott: No.

347
00:24:17,351 --> 00:24:18,154
Scott: And it's even worse.

348
00:24:18,234 --> 00:24:24,510
Scott: Not only are they fighting over who plays, but there is the same thing we've talked about in Competitive vs Casual.

349
00:24:24,891 --> 00:24:25,112
Scott: Right.

350
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:30,866
Scott: Where some of the pickleball players are for serious and some of them are just like, not serious at all.

351
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,873
Rym: Because it's so perfect.

352
00:24:34,174 --> 00:24:40,190
Rym: Quote, this debate has led to a number of flash points over the summer, including players refusing to leave courts when their time was up.

353
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:46,023
Rym: And a scene where Albert removed other nets during the game to set up his own for his boring routine.

354
00:24:46,063 --> 00:24:48,830
Rym: Like he interrupted someone's game because he was doing his own thing.

355
00:24:49,571 --> 00:25:06,050
Rym: But the thing that people seem to be the most mad about, other than the space and the time, is, quote, people are mad that sometimes there are hour long waits to play games that aren't worth it if they happen to get paired with less skilled players.

356
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:15,490
Rym: And the skilled players are arguing they should be entitled to a special skilled court time for high skill only people so they don't have to play with the noobs.

357
00:25:16,997 --> 00:25:19,850
Rym: Why do you think there's matchmaking in every fucking video game?

358
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:20,790
Scott: Right.

359
00:25:20,891 --> 00:25:32,710
Scott: So my suggestion there is if you are really that skilled, and pickleball is such an important part of your life, and you want to play a lot of pickleball, and you value it that much.

360
00:25:32,972 --> 00:25:35,290
Rym: Join a pickleball club, join a team, join a league.

361
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:38,795
Scott: And you care about it that much, and you really are that good.

362
00:25:39,596 --> 00:25:49,430
Scott: Pay to join the racquet club with money, and you can play pickleball all fucking day nonstop against other people who are also caring about it so much that they are paying money as well.

363
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:53,210
Rym: Yeah, the YMCA has a free ladder for every racquet sport you can imagine.

364
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:54,090
Scott: Right.

365
00:25:54,431 --> 00:25:55,814
Scott: Join the racquet club.

366
00:25:55,835 --> 00:25:56,897
Scott: There are lots of them.

367
00:25:56,957 --> 00:26:00,967
Scott: There are lots of racquet clubs all around the city for every weird ass sport.

368
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:07,197
Scott: You can play squash, you can play racquetball, you can play pickleball, you can play tennis.

369
00:26:07,918 --> 00:26:12,505
Scott: I don't know if you can play high life, but basically everything with balls and nets and walls.

370
00:26:12,565 --> 00:26:15,710
Scott: Volleyball, water volleyball, it's like fucking everything.

371
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:16,812
Scott: But it also leads to something else.

372
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:21,599
Rym: This matchmaking system that they are complaining about is also not official or anything.

373
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:29,350
Rym: Like when I was a kid, you wanted to play tennis, you didn't just go to a tennis court and assume someone would randomly be assigned to play with you.

374
00:26:29,691 --> 00:26:32,929
Rym: You went with someone and you two were going to play tennis against each other.

375
00:26:34,111 --> 00:26:34,291
Scott: Yep.

376
00:26:34,451 --> 00:26:42,150
Scott: So what's happening here is that people are showing up to this public park knowing that this is a big pickleball community and they're showing up alone.

377
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:43,151
Scott: Right.

378
00:26:43,511 --> 00:26:45,956
Scott: And like, you know, a team will leave a game.

379
00:26:45,976 --> 00:26:46,938
Scott: Right.

380
00:26:47,058 --> 00:26:51,245
Scott: And then you'll come in with like whoever else got there and has been waiting the longest.

381
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:51,746
Scott: Right.

382
00:26:51,806 --> 00:26:52,868
Scott: Is who you're going to be with.

383
00:26:52,928 --> 00:26:53,148
Scott: Right.

384
00:26:53,168 --> 00:26:53,990
Scott: You're not just, you know.

385
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:57,514
Scott: Otherwise, it's like I'll show up in the morning early.

386
00:26:57,674 --> 00:26:58,656
Scott: I'll be in line.

387
00:26:58,736 --> 00:27:00,899
Scott: And then when my friends get there, I'm like, you can't.

388
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:01,920
Scott: It doesn't work that way.

389
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:02,360
Scott: Right.

390
00:27:02,441 --> 00:27:09,390
Rym: So and now the casual players are accusing the people who care about the game more of being basically Nazis.

391
00:27:09,831 --> 00:27:14,823
Rym: And then the people who are better at the game are accusing the less skilled players of hogging court time.

392
00:27:14,863 --> 00:27:17,229
Scott: A bunch of adults acting like children.

393
00:27:17,249 --> 00:27:17,810
Scott: What else is new?

394
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:25,238
Rym: So if pickleball continues to be popular, it isn't just the fourth wave of it becoming a fad and coming and going.

395
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,782
Rym: I feel like New York City is going to say, all right, y'all fucked up.

396
00:27:29,143 --> 00:27:30,284
Rym: It's 100 bucks a year.

397
00:27:30,304 --> 00:27:33,808
Rym: There's going to be municipal pickleball courts and we're going to regulate it like we do tennis.

398
00:27:34,148 --> 00:27:35,670
Rym: The tennis people don't get into fistfights.

399
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:41,492
Rym: So, yeah, this is why there's matchmaking in competitive FPS.

400
00:27:42,973 --> 00:27:43,574
Rym: So what's your news?

401
00:27:43,594 --> 00:27:44,474
Rym: This Pokemon thing?

402
00:27:45,315 --> 00:27:46,296
Scott: Yeah.

403
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:49,298
Scott: So another very geek night story.

404
00:27:49,378 --> 00:27:51,039
Scott: So there were some Pokemon championships.

405
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:52,400
Scott: We're talking about the video game here.

406
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,021
Scott: Right.

407
00:27:53,481 --> 00:27:55,423
Scott: And it is basically, you know, we know Pokemon.

408
00:27:55,443 --> 00:27:56,103
Scott: You're listening to this.

409
00:27:56,143 --> 00:27:58,605
Scott: You know, Pokemon is two components to being good at Pokemon.

410
00:27:58,625 --> 00:28:04,869
Scott: Number one is you have to put together a team of six Pokemon that are trained.

411
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:05,590
Scott: Right.

412
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:07,052
Scott: And have very high stats.

413
00:28:07,332 --> 00:28:07,593
Scott: Right.

414
00:28:07,673 --> 00:28:08,474
Scott: And how do you do that?

415
00:28:08,574 --> 00:28:08,975
Scott: Grinding.

416
00:28:09,015 --> 00:28:14,542
Scott: That's how you get IVs and EVs and ruining your life, feeding them the right foods, breeding them.

417
00:28:14,863 --> 00:28:15,083
Scott: Right.

418
00:28:15,103 --> 00:28:20,170
Scott: You just spent hours and hours and hours training the Pokemon to get them to be the strongest.

419
00:28:21,071 --> 00:28:28,117
Scott: And once you've done that, it's like now you have a chance to enter the second part of Pokemon, which is the actual battle.

420
00:28:28,237 --> 00:28:32,741
Scott: Choose which Pokemon you're going to send out first and choose which move you're going to use.

421
00:28:33,101 --> 00:28:37,325
Scott: And a sort of rock, paper, scissor battle that also involves Pokemon knowledge.

422
00:28:37,885 --> 00:28:40,788
Scott: And it's actually kind of an OK ish kind of game.

423
00:28:40,828 --> 00:28:41,228
Scott: Right.

424
00:28:41,328 --> 00:28:43,009
Rym: I like Pokemon battle as a concept.

425
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:43,630
Scott: Right.

426
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:47,455
Scott: But it's like, you know, Pokemon battle is not so bad a game, really.

427
00:28:47,515 --> 00:28:50,279
Scott: It's not too far off from like, you know, competitive game.

428
00:28:50,299 --> 00:28:53,163
Rym: But IV and IV training is just poison for the soul.

429
00:28:53,804 --> 00:28:58,169
Scott: Training is a competition that tests who invested the most time.

430
00:28:58,410 --> 00:28:58,610
Scott: Right.

431
00:28:59,051 --> 00:28:59,952
Scott: So what?

432
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:12,688
Scott: So if you are to hold a Pokemon competition and you are to say that people must legitimately train all their Pokemon, what you're saying is that nobody has a chance of winning this competition.

433
00:29:12,708 --> 00:29:13,249
Scott: You could enter.

434
00:29:13,289 --> 00:29:13,790
Scott: Go right ahead.

435
00:29:14,311 --> 00:29:21,800
Scott: But you can only have a chance of winning if you have already spent X hours of your life training the Pokemon.

436
00:29:22,081 --> 00:29:22,301
Scott: Right.

437
00:29:22,662 --> 00:29:26,326
Scott: If you are not willing to sacrifice that many hours of your life, you can enter.

438
00:29:26,647 --> 00:29:29,130
Scott: But you can't win this thing unless you have insane luck.

439
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:40,250
Rym: If you couldn't play tennis against anyone or pickleball, unless you stood in your house for 40 hours a week for a year, just bouncing the ball on your racket and then you play tennis.

440
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:40,810
Scott: Yeah.

441
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:45,456
Scott: The hours you spend on, you know, I think in competitions in general.

442
00:29:45,736 --> 00:29:46,037
Scott: Right.

443
00:29:46,137 --> 00:29:49,501
Scott: If you're talking about a fair competition where there are prizes at stake.

444
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:56,590
Scott: where this is actually meaningful, nobody should get an advantage that is directly linked to time invested.

445
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:56,931
Scott: Right.

446
00:29:57,131 --> 00:30:01,718
Scott: We don't give veteran sports athletes like free points when the game starts.

447
00:30:01,879 --> 00:30:02,059
Scott: Right.

448
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:03,401
Scott: We don't let them use.

449
00:30:03,562 --> 00:30:06,647
Rym: Old gummy Joe has been playing hockey for 40 years.

450
00:30:06,947 --> 00:30:08,610
Rym: His team gets an extra point when the game starts.

451
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:09,450
Scott: Yeah.

452
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:10,512
Scott: It's like we don't do that.

453
00:30:10,592 --> 00:30:10,712
Scott: Right.

454
00:30:10,752 --> 00:30:14,378
Scott: We don't let old gummy Joe use us an illegal stick.

455
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:17,203
Scott: You know, we don't let him have upgraded equipments.

456
00:30:17,584 --> 00:30:17,784
Scott: Right.

457
00:30:17,844 --> 00:30:21,450
Scott: If we actually if there's prizes on the line, then it should be a fair competition.

458
00:30:22,191 --> 00:30:27,139
Scott: And the only thing that should matter are people's skills and not just time invested.

459
00:30:27,199 --> 00:30:29,824
Scott: So everyone knows open secret.

460
00:30:29,824 --> 00:30:33,710
Scott: 90 plus percent of Pokemon competitive players cheat.

461
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:40,820
Scott: They use software to craft and create the ideal Pokemon, their ideal Pokemon team.

462
00:30:40,981 --> 00:30:47,130
Scott: There might not be an ideal Pokemon team, but their ideal team so they don't have to grind and sacrifice hours of their life.

463
00:30:47,651 --> 00:30:55,350
Scott: They could instead spend the time in their life practicing the battle part, the actual game part, and be better at that, the actual skill game.

464
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:58,774
Rym: I'll say right now, pure direct value judgment.

465
00:30:59,475 --> 00:31:00,116
Rym: Absolutely.

466
00:31:00,136 --> 00:31:02,479
Rym: I think that's fine.

467
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:10,290
Rym: If the Pokemon you bring to the Pokemon tournament is legitimately possible without cheating at the Pokemon game.

468
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:14,378
Rym: Like you can't bring an unknown with infinite stats like that.

469
00:31:14,418 --> 00:31:20,330
Scott: They're not making these people are not making Pokemon that could not have been trained.

470
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:24,877
Scott: They're not like, haha, I've got a Pikachu that has all a thousand stats.

471
00:31:24,917 --> 00:31:32,350
Scott: It's like, no, it has the max stats a Pikachu could have if you spent a whole year training it to perfect.

472
00:31:32,511 --> 00:31:37,390
Rym: And you got lucky and got the right Pikachu with the right like hidden stats and whatevers.

473
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,973
Scott: Yes, it's possible.

474
00:31:40,133 --> 00:31:40,834
Scott: It's illegal.

475
00:31:41,315 --> 00:31:43,579
Scott: If you had trained it, it would be legal, right?

476
00:31:43,719 --> 00:31:50,370
Scott: There's nothing breaking the rules of the game about it other than they've arbitrarily decided that you have to actually legitimately.

477
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:57,770
Rym: I think the people who get mad about this are the same people who get mad if someone else in an MMO bought gold or levels instead of grinded them.

478
00:31:58,171 --> 00:31:59,635
Scott: Well, I think that what's happening here.

479
00:31:59,735 --> 00:32:05,770
Scott: Well, I think, you know, well, people who don't have I'm going to make a value judgment and I can make a human judgment.

480
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:09,236
Scott: Those people are people who don't have a lot of skill, right?

481
00:32:09,577 --> 00:32:11,661
Rym: I'd also make that same value judge.

482
00:32:11,701 --> 00:32:15,870
Scott: They don't value being, you know, they don't value themselves being good at something.

483
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:25,461
Scott: And when they play a game like, say, a JRPG, those games make those people feel good because anyone, regardless of skills, can invest time.

484
00:32:25,541 --> 00:32:26,883
Scott: Everyone has time, right?

485
00:32:27,043 --> 00:32:32,950
Scott: Even the worst, most disgusting person, the saddest person and the best person all have time.

486
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,232
Scott: The same amount of it, right?

487
00:32:34,292 --> 00:32:34,893
Scott: Relatively.

488
00:32:34,993 --> 00:32:45,270
Scott: So anyone can invest time and a game that rewards you simply for investing time makes you feel like a winner regardless of whether you're actually good or bad.

489
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:52,290
Rym: We've done so many panels on this, the difference between training versus playing or time versus effort.

490
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:53,130
Scott: Right.

491
00:32:53,170 --> 00:33:04,110
Scott: And so those people who are feeling like a winner because of time investment and they see somebody else winning more or beating them who hasn't done time investment, but is maybe just actually good at a thing.

492
00:33:04,711 --> 00:33:05,412
Scott: They don't like that.

493
00:33:05,512 --> 00:33:05,692
Scott: Right.

494
00:33:05,712 --> 00:33:08,116
Scott: Because now they're illusion that they're a winner.

495
00:33:08,337 --> 00:33:12,123
Scott: That has been the lie that they're holding in front of themselves is now vanished.

496
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:12,764
Scott: Right.

497
00:33:12,844 --> 00:33:15,047
Scott: It's like, oh, I'm not actually good at a thing.

498
00:33:15,067 --> 00:33:16,790
Scott: I just invested a lot of time.

499
00:33:17,151 --> 00:33:22,550
Scott: And it's like they need to make the thing that's making the lie vanish go away to keep the illusion in place.

500
00:33:24,133 --> 00:33:25,375
Scott: And so, right.

501
00:33:25,816 --> 00:33:30,325
Scott: Like I said, almost all the Pokemon players, I think the players basically agree with us.

502
00:33:30,385 --> 00:33:31,407
Scott: They're okay.

503
00:33:31,588 --> 00:33:32,630
Scott: The players don't care.

504
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:39,940
Scott: They're okay with people just cheating to get the Pokemon as long as they're not cheating Pokemon.

505
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:40,261
Scott: Right.

506
00:33:40,281 --> 00:33:42,324
Scott: They're just didn't spend their life grinding.

507
00:33:42,784 --> 00:33:46,710
Scott: But Nintendo operating the tournaments is not okay with that.

508
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:57,242
Scott: So a few people got caught, I guess, somehow having their Pokemon were not legitimately grinded and trained by hand slowly and methodically.

509
00:33:57,843 --> 00:34:03,609
Scott: And so those people got disqualified, even though the vast majority of players also, I guess you should just qualify 90% of the field.

510
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:04,871
Scott: I don't know.

511
00:34:06,735 --> 00:34:14,469
Rym: But there's no way that many human beings grinded the amount of hours it would take to get the lucky special Dragonite.

512
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:15,409
Scott: Yeah.

513
00:34:15,531 --> 00:34:16,713
Scott: With the perfect stats.

514
00:34:17,112 --> 00:34:17,313
Scott: Right.

515
00:34:17,414 --> 00:34:18,155
Scott: And then you had to do that.

516
00:34:18,376 --> 00:34:22,443
Scott: Not you get to do that for six Pokemon, not just for one six whole team.

517
00:34:22,904 --> 00:34:25,789
Scott: You don't want to walk in with like five perfect Pokemon in one week.

518
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:26,489
Scott: One right.

519
00:34:26,949 --> 00:34:29,272
Scott: They got to all have the best possible set.

520
00:34:29,351 --> 00:34:39,800
Scott: So yeah, it's a real shame because I think that, you know, if Nintendo would just let you or in fact make a legitimate way to do this for competitive purposes.

521
00:34:40,221 --> 00:34:40,501
Scott: Right.

522
00:34:41,562 --> 00:34:43,402
Scott: I think it would actually, I don't think that Pokemon needs boosting.

523
00:34:43,422 --> 00:34:44,904
Rym: I think it would make the Pokemon competitive scene better.

524
00:34:44,924 --> 00:34:48,627
Scott: Pokemon's already the most popular, most money making intellectual property of all time.

525
00:34:48,647 --> 00:34:52,350
Rym: Oh yeah, I think it would just make the scene better and remove this source of drama.

526
00:34:53,871 --> 00:34:54,031
Scott: Yep.

527
00:34:54,112 --> 00:34:55,013
Scott: But they're not doing that.

528
00:34:55,074 --> 00:35:01,908
Scott: So for the time being, it's like you either have to grind, hope you don't get caught or don't play competitive Pokemon.

529
00:35:01,928 --> 00:35:02,770
Scott: Those are your three choices.

530
00:35:03,311 --> 00:35:09,781
Rym: My advice to you, hack and just don't get caught because you're not cheating in my perspective and I doubt you'll get caught.

531
00:35:10,823 --> 00:35:13,567
Scott: Only a few people got caught when almost everyone was cheating.

532
00:35:13,607 --> 00:35:15,149
Scott: So go ahead.

533
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:23,854
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

534
00:35:23,975 --> 00:35:26,758
Rym: So this is partly an example.

535
00:35:27,539 --> 00:35:29,221
Rym: This isn't going to fool anyone.

536
00:35:29,301 --> 00:35:31,944
Rym: It's obviously an AI generated content.

537
00:35:32,064 --> 00:35:33,326
Rym: It's labeled as such.

538
00:35:33,366 --> 00:35:34,387
Rym: It's intended to be such.

539
00:35:34,727 --> 00:35:36,810
Rym: It's basically just a demonstration.

540
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:39,152
Scott: It was before I even saw the label.

541
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:40,274
Scott: Yep, absolutely.

542
00:35:40,654 --> 00:35:43,477
Rym: But the title YouTube title video is called AI.

543
00:35:43,537 --> 00:35:55,710
Rym: Tom Scott talks about Sneed and basically someone wrote, uh, if you don't know Tom Scott, he's one of those popular YouTubers, but unlike a lot of them, he's acting like his content is pretty good and he doesn't seem like he's a bad person.

544
00:35:56,451 --> 00:36:07,805
Scott: As far as I could tell, I didn't even know what his name was, but it's just like, oh, that's that guy who always appears on YouTube, but looks like he's on like, you know, one of those TV cable channels.

545
00:36:08,005 --> 00:36:08,285
Scott: Right.

546
00:36:08,706 --> 00:36:12,190
Scott: It's like he does like a National Geographic kind of production.

547
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:13,051
Scott: Good content.

548
00:36:13,351 --> 00:36:18,157
Rym: It's, it's a little bit of mix of like teaching you something plus some investigative journalism.

549
00:36:18,237 --> 00:36:29,810
Scott: Like there's like, it looks like someone's doing a report for like, you know, the BBC or something, but it's just this guy who's on YouTube, but he has a very particular style for one.

550
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:39,256
Rym: And two, he has made so many hours of content that training an AI model to mimic his voice is basically a trivial exercise.

551
00:36:39,677 --> 00:36:46,521
Rym: So someone, this YouTube channel just train, had an AI model that will mimic his voice, wrote a script.

552
00:36:46,581 --> 00:36:58,970
Rym: that is exactly the kind of thing he would talk about, about a made up thing, which happens to be one of the least noticed jokes in the first 11 years of The Simpsons, Sneed's Feed and Seed.

553
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:06,197
Rym: And it sounds exactly like Tom Scott to my ears.

554
00:37:06,278 --> 00:37:07,399
Rym: Like, I know it's fake.

555
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:10,583
Rym: I know it's not him, but it's basically perfect.

556
00:37:11,805 --> 00:37:12,326
Rym: So what do you got?

557
00:37:12,506 --> 00:37:15,450
Rym: Oh, you've got the best possible Pax Omegathon ever.

558
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:16,991
Scott: Yeah.

559
00:37:17,131 --> 00:37:21,454
Scott: So I'm sure most people here know about Rock'em Sock'em robots, which is a toy.

560
00:37:21,474 --> 00:37:22,755
Scott: It's also a game.

561
00:37:23,216 --> 00:37:25,838
Scott: It's a plastic toy with a little plastic boxing ring.

562
00:37:25,878 --> 00:37:29,581
Scott: And both players have basically two little joysticks with buttons on them.

563
00:37:30,142 --> 00:37:35,787
Scott: And you can use them to move your road as a plastic robot, like physical plastic robot attached to them.

564
00:37:36,247 --> 00:37:39,770
Scott: And you can move the robot a little bit and you push the buttons to punch.

565
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:45,396
Scott: And you're trying to punch the other robot in the head and not get punched in, you're not get your robot punched in the head.

566
00:37:45,977 --> 00:37:49,360
Scott: And so as soon as their head pops up out of their body, that's a win.

567
00:37:49,661 --> 00:37:51,303
Scott: And you can play to however many points you want.

568
00:37:51,703 --> 00:37:56,028
Scott: It's basically like Street Fighter, but physical in the real world, but no people have to get hurt.

569
00:37:56,628 --> 00:37:57,990
Scott: Sort of like BattleBots, really.

570
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:00,551
Rym: But also it doesn't actually work that well.

571
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:01,452
Scott: Like no motors.

572
00:38:01,632 --> 00:38:01,952
Scott: Yeah.

573
00:38:02,152 --> 00:38:04,154
Rym: Like Rock'em Sock'em robots kind of doesn't work.

574
00:38:04,474 --> 00:38:05,815
Rym: And I remember we want to, it's

575
00:38:05,895 --> 00:38:24,888
Scott: a really cheap, you could make a nice one that worked and was fair, but they're so imprecisely manufactured and poorly manufactured that who wins and loses often ends up being to just like, Oh yeah, this particular Rock'em Sock'em robots, like the mechanism reds head is a little loose and pops up kind of easy and blues is really stiff.

576
00:38:24,908 --> 00:38:27,370
Scott: So you're going to win most of the time.

577
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:34,179
Rym: The head of the Omegathon finale at PAX did an AMA and you asked him, what about Rock'em Sock'em robots?

578
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:37,584
Rym: And he literally was like, look, yeah, we thought it was a good idea too.

579
00:38:38,085 --> 00:38:40,869
Rym: We tried, we tested, it doesn't fucking work.

580
00:38:41,349 --> 00:38:41,850
Rym: It's terrible.

581
00:38:42,791 --> 00:38:43,432
Scott: It is terrible.

582
00:38:43,512 --> 00:38:46,074
Scott: So what if you could make something like that?

583
00:38:46,295 --> 00:38:46,915
Scott: Not terrible.

584
00:38:46,955 --> 00:38:49,118
Scott: It's basically puppet fight, right?

585
00:38:49,158 --> 00:38:59,368
Scott: Like I've got a marionette, you got a marionette and you know, they both have, you know, they punch and kick each other and there's some mechanism for determining which marionette wins.

586
00:38:59,448 --> 00:38:59,588
Scott: Right.

587
00:38:59,608 --> 00:39:00,890
Scott: That's basically what it is.

588
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:01,150
Scott: Right.

589
00:39:01,791 --> 00:39:03,915
Scott: And that's actually kind of cool because it's real.

590
00:39:03,935 --> 00:39:12,350
Scott: Like I said, it's Street Fighter, only the controls are, you know, marionette controls as opposed to, you know, a game pad or a joystick.

591
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:19,840
Scott: Here we have some genius people who have made a certain kind of puppet.

592
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:26,930
Scott: I would guess it's definitely puppet category that has a balloon for a head and an actual sword.

593
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:40,000
Scott: And so these two identical puppets, you control one of them and whoever's head gets popped by a sword first wins as long as the swords are equally sharp and they're manufactured identically.

594
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,282
Scott: This seems fair to me.

595
00:39:41,302 --> 00:39:47,467
Scott: It looks much more, much more advanced and awesome looking than Rock'em Sock'em robots.

596
00:39:47,767 --> 00:39:48,768
Scott: It's equally safe.

597
00:39:49,048 --> 00:39:51,250
Scott: It's probably the safest way to have a real sword fight.

598
00:39:53,471 --> 00:39:54,493
Scott: It seems like a lot of fun.

599
00:39:54,533 --> 00:39:56,958
Scott: I really want to play, but I think it's a one off so far.

600
00:39:56,998 --> 00:40:02,550
Scott: Who knows if this will become a, you know, I don't think you could have children play this because they'd hurt themselves with the swords.

601
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:12,530
Rym: Yeah, but two adults at, say, a Penny Arcade Expo, a Megathon finale with a big bespoke version of that on stage, that would be legendary.

602
00:40:13,251 --> 00:40:15,278
Scott: Yeah, I think this is just frickin' awesome.

603
00:40:15,338 --> 00:40:18,249
Scott: I hope that they get a patent for this and start selling it.

604
00:40:18,653 --> 00:40:19,087
Rym: I'd buy it.

605
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:19,919
Scott: Yeah.

606
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:22,438
Rym: I mean, I almost bought Clask.

607
00:40:22,598 --> 00:40:24,246
Rym: Clask I almost bought, but I didn't.

608
00:40:24,327 --> 00:40:24,950
Rym: I would buy this.

609
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:30,310
Scott: I mean, even if you don't use this a lot, this is so, it's just the fact that this is it.

610
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:34,110
Rym: You bust this out at a party once and it pays for itself no matter how much it costs.

611
00:40:34,791 --> 00:40:35,316
Scott: I know, right?

612
00:40:35,396 --> 00:40:36,203
Scott: I'd pay a few hundred.

613
00:40:36,486 --> 00:40:36,849
Scott: Anyway.

614
00:40:37,811 --> 00:40:46,390
Rym: In the meta moment, the Geek Nights Book Club book, the last of the Murderbot Diaries, or at least the next Murderbot Diary, I bet there'll be more, came out today.

615
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:47,977
Scott: Oh, did it really?

616
00:40:47,997 --> 00:40:49,410
Scott: I was about to look it up.

617
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:51,860
Rym: Today was the day I had on my calendar.

618
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:52,784
Rym: that said it comes out.

619
00:40:53,045 --> 00:40:54,070
Rym: I did not confirm.

620
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:56,330
Scott: I'm confirming, you just keep talking.

621
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:56,511
Scott: Yep.

622
00:40:56,812 --> 00:41:01,770
Rym: So, the Murderbot Diaries, the whole set of them, all the Murderbots are the Geek Nights Book Club.

623
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:07,149
Rym: Since, unless I am wrong and Scott's about to correct me, the last one, or the most recent one, just came out.

624
00:41:07,691 --> 00:41:08,577
Rym: Read that one.

625
00:41:08,778 --> 00:41:09,443
Rym: Read all of them.

626
00:41:09,463 --> 00:41:10,350
Rym: They're very short reads.

627
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:14,410
Rym: And in a few weeks, we're going to do the episode on the collected Murderbot Diaries.

628
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:16,413
Scott: System collapse.

629
00:41:16,734 --> 00:41:18,639
Scott: Book seven of seven.

630
00:41:18,659 --> 00:41:22,510
Scott: The Murderbot Diaries is on sale.

631
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:23,230
Rym: Yes.

632
00:41:24,031 --> 00:41:24,526
Rym: Right now.

633
00:41:25,431 --> 00:41:26,776
Rym: I really like these books.

634
00:41:27,017 --> 00:41:28,422
Rym: I got a lot to say about them.

635
00:41:29,024 --> 00:41:30,590
Rym: I think it'll be a good book club episode.

636
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:39,270
Rym: So, I highly recommend you read a bunch of them because I really want to talk about it in the context of assuming you've read these books.

637
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:41,790
Rym: Murderbot is a delightful character.

638
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:42,333
Scott: November 14th.

639
00:41:42,394 --> 00:41:43,440
Scott: It was released today.

640
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,688
Scott: I guess I know what I'm doing later.

641
00:41:44,828 --> 00:41:45,070
Scott: Alright.

642
00:41:45,591 --> 00:41:48,469
Scott: If I- Even though I am still reading The Iliad, though.

643
00:41:49,231 --> 00:41:49,612
Rym: Oh, yeah.

644
00:41:49,793 --> 00:41:50,496
Rym: The Iliad.

645
00:41:50,576 --> 00:41:53,790
Rym: I feel like we might have to do a pause and do a special book club just on that book.

646
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:55,970
Scott: We don't need to do an episode on it just because I'm reading it.

647
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:57,077
Rym: I think we should do an episode on it.

648
00:41:57,641 --> 00:41:58,689
Rym: I feel like I'll have a lot to say.

649
00:42:00,652 --> 00:42:01,928
Scott: We're going to go to Pax Unplugged.

650
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:02,451
Rym: Yep.

651
00:42:02,471 --> 00:42:05,010
Rym: We're going to be at Pax Unplugged doing two events.

652
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:10,770
Rym: We are teaching the basics of trick taking, including how to be good at them, or at least reasonably good at them.

653
00:42:11,472 --> 00:42:12,174
Rym: We're not pros.

654
00:42:12,194 --> 00:42:17,050
Rym: We're not the best trick taking players in the world, but I'm going to say we're pretty good at trick taking games.

655
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:20,869
Rym: And if you follow our advice, you'll be most of your friends at most trick taking games.

656
00:42:22,411 --> 00:42:24,296
Rym: And we're doing a panel.

657
00:42:24,296 --> 00:42:29,390
Rym: 59 minutes of us talking about nothing but worker placement.

658
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:38,670
Rym: And the more sub-research I've done to put these slides together, yeah, we could do a four-hour panel on worker placement and not run out of stuff to say.

659
00:42:39,436 --> 00:42:40,430
Scott: I mean, that's a pretty big one.

660
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:41,352
Rym: It is a pretty big one.

661
00:42:41,593 --> 00:42:47,470
Rym: We picked the easiest one that we have the most opinions about first because that makes it easy for us to make a panel.

662
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:52,489
Rym: If we talk about Rondels, that's going to be a harder one to put together, I think.

663
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:53,740
Scott: Yep.

664
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:56,701
Rym: So, yeah, we'll see you at Pax Unplugged.

665
00:42:56,721 --> 00:42:57,385
Rym: We're going to be there.

666
00:42:57,405 --> 00:42:58,190
Rym: It's going to be a good time.

667
00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:00,056
Rym: If you're there, say hi, play some games.

668
00:43:00,919 --> 00:43:04,090
Rym: And I feel like we should just get right into Cobalt Core.

669
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:13,010
Scott: So, when we were at Pax West, one of the games we saw in the expo hall that I saw briefly from -- I didn't play it.

670
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:17,685
Scott: I just saw -- maybe I played it for like two seconds, but I just saw it briefly and I could tell right away.

671
00:43:17,725 --> 00:43:18,748
Scott: I'm like, "That's the

672
00:43:18,788 --> 00:43:19,029
Scott: game.".

673
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:22,299
Scott: I could see right from here that that's one of the games.

674
00:43:22,339 --> 00:43:23,202
Scott: I got to take a photo.

675
00:43:23,242 --> 00:43:24,305
Scott: I got to write it down.

676
00:43:24,346 --> 00:43:25,770
Scott: I got to add it to my Steam wish list.

677
00:43:26,331 --> 00:43:27,549
Scott: That's going to be one of the games.

678
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:33,102
Rym: I similarly -- I took a photo with my phone because that's how I remind myself.

679
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:36,210
Rym: this is something to check into a few months after the con.

680
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:39,256
Rym: And Scott and I both had the same opinion.

681
00:43:39,316 --> 00:43:43,868
Rym: We saw it and we said, "Wow, that's just FTL crossed with Slay the

682
00:43:43,888 --> 00:43:44,209
Rym: Spire.".

683
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:47,130
Rym: And those are both great, so I assume this is going to be great.

684
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:50,650
Scott: Yeah, there are many games that are trying to be Slay the Spire.

685
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:50,818
Scott: Yep.

686
00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:54,530
Scott: Just like there's many games that are trying to be Vampire Survivors, right?

687
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:59,430
Scott: And most of them, you know, are okay to, you know, different varying levels of quality.

688
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:01,770
Rym: But kind of like how there's a lot of deck buildings.

689
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:03,530
Scott: Yeah, I've played a handful.

690
00:44:03,831 --> 00:44:10,147
Rym: Like there's a lot of deck builders out there, like tabletop ones, but Dominion kind of is just better than 99% of them.

691
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:14,704
Rym: Same thing, Slay the Spire is just better than 99% of its clones.

692
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:26,608
Scott: But Cobalt Core, having played this one, I was like, "Okay, let's see how it, you know, compares to the others in this sort of category of solo, rogue deck building kind of

693
00:44:26,648 --> 00:44:26,949
Scott: deals.".

694
00:44:28,253 --> 00:44:32,950
Scott: And I got to say, this is the first one that might actually be better than Slay the Spire.

695
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:33,773
Rym: I would agree.

696
00:44:33,933 --> 00:44:36,502
Rym: It is added, because Slay the Spire is as good as it is.

697
00:44:36,542 --> 00:44:38,850
Rym: Like, I still play it, like, just kind of often.

698
00:44:39,193 --> 00:44:40,030
Scott: I haven't played it in years.

699
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:42,850
Rym: Well, because I'm trying to hit Ascension 20 with every character, and I'm getting close.

700
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:43,290
Scott: Okay.

701
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:55,590
Rym: But Slay the Spire does have some fairly narrow boundaries of what is possible, and you're kind of always just looking for the broken, infinite, lucky combo.

702
00:44:57,450 --> 00:45:01,150
Rym: But it's within pretty hard bounds of what cards can do.

703
00:45:01,673 --> 00:45:03,950
Rym: Now, on the other side, FTL, another game.

704
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:22,630
Rym: FTL's main flaw, if I have to ascribe to it a primary flaw, is that no matter how good you are at it, you are so deeply beholden to randomly getting the items and weapons you want, that you can't apply that much, like, planning to FTL.

705
00:45:23,531 --> 00:45:25,895
Rym: This game has solved both of those problems.

706
00:45:26,736 --> 00:45:35,890
Rym: In terms of comparing it to Slay the Spire, it added a few more degrees of freedom to what is possible, and that opens up the fucking game in a way you wouldn't believe.

707
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:43,890
Rym: And compared to FTL, it gets rid of the things that just fuck you randomly in FTL, and gives you all the good parts of FTL.

708
00:45:44,971 --> 00:45:48,810
Scott: So, the way this game works is, obviously, you have a deck of cards, right?

709
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:52,410
Scott: And on your turn, you have some, you know, three energy, right?

710
00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:55,078
Scott: And you can play three energy worth of cards.

711
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:58,370
Scott: All the rest of the cards get discarded, and then you draw a new hand.

712
00:45:59,652 --> 00:46:07,550
Scott: And what you're doing is, those cards, what they're interacting with, in Slay the Spire, you just have a character who is attacking and defending against enemies.

713
00:46:08,071 --> 00:46:09,596
Scott: Here, you have a spaceship.

714
00:46:10,097 --> 00:46:14,490
Scott: And the spaceship has pieces, right, that are each in a column.

715
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:20,690
Scott: And one of those, depending on the ship you have, but the normal ship you're going to start with has a cannon in one of those columns.

716
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:25,710
Scott: So when you shoot, you're only doing damage in that column, and the enemy is opposite you.

717
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:34,530
Scott: So you want to play a card that attacks when your cannon is in the same column as a piece of the enemy's ship, so that you can hit them.

718
00:46:34,872 --> 00:46:37,590
Rym: And you can play a card that attacks for some amount of damage.

719
00:46:38,191 --> 00:46:42,409
Scott: And you can also play cards that put up shields, which just block incoming damage.

720
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:45,810
Rym: Well, put up persistent shields until you've filled them, or temporary shields.

721
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:50,870
Rym: You can play cards that give you the ability to move your ship, arbitrarily.

722
00:46:51,830 --> 00:47:01,810
Rym: So you're banking this resource now of not just shields and damage and life, but I have eight moves of my ship, so I might move my ship a bunch to the right or a bunch to the left.

723
00:47:02,091 --> 00:47:06,990
Rym: In this infinite sea of movement, and the enemy ship also moves, you can play cards that just move you.

724
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:08,815
Rym: You can play cards that shoot missiles.

725
00:47:09,096 --> 00:47:12,990
Rym: You can play cards that drop drones and things of various kinds.

726
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:17,109
Scott: Yep, it's like there's quite a lot of things that you can do.

727
00:47:18,971 --> 00:47:28,770
Scott: And it's like, wow, there's really a lot of different systems going on here that are all interacting with each other in ways that make sense, and it doesn't actually get complicated.

728
00:47:29,693 --> 00:47:34,790
Scott: It's like they added a lot of systems without it becoming a mess, right?

729
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:39,361
Scott: It's like, wow, usually when people add that many systems, it becomes a big bag of nonsense, right?

730
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:48,090
Scott: But it's like, no, it all kind of works together, and it's actually an interesting challenge.

731
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:57,370
Scott: You're like, okay, these are the cards I have, what order can I play them in to do the most damage to the enemy and have the least damage to myself?

732
00:47:57,591 --> 00:48:01,950
Scott: And you repeat that over and over and over again until you win or lose.

733
00:48:02,930 --> 00:48:10,930
Rym: And I guess, so it has surpassed some of the limitations of Slave Aspire, like it's just better in terms of the options you have available and the degrees of freedom.

734
00:48:11,411 --> 00:48:18,830
Rym: It's better than FTL in that it gets rid of the parts of FTL that actually are not fun, but scratches that same itch.

735
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:26,290
Rym: And then it's also got this dimension of cute characters and funny dialogue, and there is a plot.

736
00:48:27,211 --> 00:48:30,419
Scott: So the way it works is you start with these three characters, right?

737
00:48:30,459 --> 00:48:34,630
Scott: And each character has a set of starting cards that go in your deck.

738
00:48:35,831 --> 00:48:43,030
Scott: And then you unlock more characters, and whenever you start a run, you choose which three characters you're going to bring with you.

739
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:52,490
Scott: Now, even though there's only, I think, eight characters, if you unlock all of them, and that's not a spoiler because there's like eight squares on the left, it shows you that.

740
00:48:53,111 --> 00:48:54,293
Scott: You just don't know who they all are.

741
00:48:56,698 --> 00:48:57,960
Scott: You can combine any three.

742
00:48:58,562 --> 00:49:02,870
Scott: So it's like, unlike Slave Aspire, where there's basically like three characters.

743
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:04,069
Scott: I don't know if they add any more.

744
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:04,627
Rym: Yeah, there's four.

745
00:49:06,711 --> 00:49:08,141
Rym: Well, you haven't played with the fourth one.

746
00:49:08,161 --> 00:49:09,410
Rym: You should check out that fourth character.

747
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:10,270
Scott: Which one's the fourth one?

748
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:10,727
Scott: The monk.

749
00:49:12,571 --> 00:49:15,590
Scott: Oh, I think I stopped playing like shortly when that came out, yeah.

750
00:49:16,591 --> 00:49:21,690
Scott: Anyway, there's like, if you choose three of eight, how many possible combinations are there?

751
00:49:22,214 --> 00:49:23,524
Rym: Oh, God.

752
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:24,270
Rym: A lot, actually.

753
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:25,592
Scott: A lot, yeah.

754
00:49:25,652 --> 00:49:33,030
Scott: So it's like, there's a lot of different options for your starting deck, and each character, their starting cards have like a completely different system.

755
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:37,740
Scott: One character has like pretty basic, a lot of shield cards with a few attack cards.

756
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:42,110
Scott: Another character has a lot of attack cards and a lot of immediate movement.

757
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:47,049
Scott: Another character has a lot of move how you want to move kind of cards, right?

758
00:49:48,411 --> 00:49:53,390
Scott: Another character has a lot of, you know, missiles and obstacles to play with the middle system, right?

759
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:58,410
Scott: That's going, you know, automatic turrets and meteors and all those sorts of, and so on and so forth.

760
00:49:59,331 --> 00:50:05,850
Scott: Each character has a completely different like system of way their cards work, almost like a different color in Magic the Gathering, right?

761
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:13,750
Scott: And then you go on a run with like this completely, and you can't actually customize your deck too much.

762
00:50:14,051 --> 00:50:24,910
Scott: It's really easy to add garbage cards to your deck, but it's actually kind of difficult to like remove cards, and it's pretty rare to get upgraded cards.

763
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:28,196
Rym: So the cards end up like a lot of good tabletop war games.

764
00:50:28,597 --> 00:50:34,550
Rym: They give you like the boundaries of what are the possibilities for this turn, like what are my options?

765
00:50:35,411 --> 00:50:39,470
Rym: So imagine you're the captain of the ship, and you're like, engineering, what do you got for me?

766
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:43,089
Rym: And they're like, well, I can launch some drones or we can fire the cannon, but I can't do both.

767
00:50:44,912 --> 00:50:45,152
Scott: Yep.

768
00:50:45,313 --> 00:50:50,390
Scott: And so then, so all that customization is going on, and then you can unlock different ships, right?

769
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:53,690
Scott: And the different ships are arranged differently and have different abilities.

770
00:50:54,651 --> 00:51:01,630
Scott: My favorite one, I guess, is the one where you have two cannons, and you can freely alternate between the two cannons.

771
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:06,065
Scott: And occasionally, if you get a mega upgrade, fire both of them simultaneously.

772
00:51:06,828 --> 00:51:07,470
Scott: That's really great.

773
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:15,949
Rym: The most fun I had is I had the basic ship, but I got the one thing that shoots every time you move, and I got another thing that like... Move a lot.

774
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:16,471
Rym: Yep.

775
00:51:16,692 --> 00:51:18,378
Rym: And I just spam them, and you know what?

776
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:21,310
Rym: Just like Slay the Spire, and this is where this kind of game can shine.

777
00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:23,955
Rym: They don't need to be balanced.

778
00:51:24,276 --> 00:51:28,768
Rym: Occasionally, just getting a combo that's utterly broken is really, really fun.

779
00:51:31,172 --> 00:51:38,250
Scott: I mean, I also got the upgrade that shoot when you move and then move a lot, and I was just moving to the right a whole bunch.

780
00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:42,788
Scott: And it'd be like this strafing run with broadsides, like doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

781
00:51:43,991 --> 00:51:51,690
Scott: And then I made it all the way to the final boss, and I lost because I was all in on that, and I didn't have enough defense, right?

782
00:51:52,030 --> 00:51:56,130
Scott: And even though I was doing a ton of damage, it wasn't enough damage to put away a final boss.

783
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:59,830
Rym: I never lost a run until I switched to hard difficulty, and I lost my first run.

784
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:05,090
Scott: No, I lost once or twice on normal, and once or twice on hard.

785
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:10,490
Scott: But I think one of the ones I lost was the very first one, and I didn't understand what the fuck was going on.

786
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:18,370
Rym: I won my first one, but it was kind of lucky, honestly, because I misunderstood some mechanics, but it didn't matter because I got really lucky.

787
00:52:20,251 --> 00:52:25,170
Scott: On normal, I've only ever died to, other than the first run, I've only died to the final boss.

788
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:28,330
Scott: I've obviously only died to really hard guys.

789
00:52:29,572 --> 00:52:32,170
Scott: But there is a hardest difficulty, so who knows what the hell's going on.

790
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:32,967
Rym: I haven't touched that yet.

791
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:40,710
Rym: But I guess to give some examples, because you could probably do a whole panel talking about the deep design of this game.

792
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:46,610
Rym: But to zoom in on a few specific examples to show you where this has surpassed the games that it is based on.

793
00:52:47,051 --> 00:52:48,134
Rym: And it's clearly based on them.

794
00:52:48,174 --> 00:52:53,770
Rym: There is no universe where the designers of this game did not sit down and say, "We're gonna cross FTL and Slay the

795
00:52:53,790 --> 00:52:53,930
Rym: Spire.".

796
00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:56,490
Scott: No, without Slay the Spire, Cobalt Core does not exist.

797
00:52:56,830 --> 00:52:58,669
Rym: Without FTL, I don't know if this game exists.

798
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:00,040
Scott: Who knows, but...

799
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:02,610
Rym: So example one, in Slay the Spire...

800
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:04,990
Scott: I think without FTL, Slay the Spire might not exist.

801
00:53:05,051 --> 00:53:06,229
Rym: I think that's true as well.

802
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:09,170
Rym: So here's a very specific example.

803
00:53:09,491 --> 00:53:12,449
Rym: In Slay the Spire, there's cards, and they all have a unique thing.

804
00:53:13,092 --> 00:53:18,490
Rym: You can, over various ways over the course of the game, upgrade a card, and this game has the same mechanic.

805
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:24,390
Rym: But Slay the Spire, it's just, here's the card, here is the upgraded, slightly better version of that card.

806
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:30,290
Rym: This game, every card, you can choose what aspect of it to upgrade.

807
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:36,290
Rym: So, multi-shot, a card that costs one energy and just does two attacks.

808
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:40,770
Rym: Well, you could make it cheaper, or you could make it do more damage.

809
00:53:41,838 --> 00:53:42,450
Rym: Pick your poison.

810
00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:45,750
Scott: Every card has an A upgrade and a B upgrade.

811
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:53,629
Rym: That level of choosing your tuning removes one of the big frustrations of Slay the Spire of, "You just might not get what you

812
00:53:53,649 --> 00:53:53,830
Rym: want.".

813
00:53:53,870 --> 00:54:01,130
Rym: Like, you can decide the direction you want to take your deck with more granularity in this game, and that is more satisfying to the player.

814
00:54:02,931 --> 00:54:06,530
Scott: Another funny example, there's this guy you can meet randomly.

815
00:54:08,111 --> 00:54:13,750
Scott: Oh, Dracula's great, but there's a guy who will give you, for free, a completely worthless card.

816
00:54:14,110 --> 00:54:23,410
Scott: Like, one of the examples is a card that, I think it costs one, or it costs one or zero, but it basically does three attacks for zero damage each.

817
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:26,330
Scott: So it just goes like, pew, pew, pew, nothing, nothing, nothing, right?

818
00:54:26,611 --> 00:54:29,910
Scott: And he also has a card that's like, move right, move left, move right, move left.

819
00:54:30,252 --> 00:54:32,485
Scott: It's like, you just end up back where you started.

820
00:54:32,546 --> 00:54:33,290
Scott: It doesn't do anything.

821
00:54:33,730 --> 00:54:38,630
Rym: Now think back, we both had that power once, you play a card that every time you move you shoot, suddenly that card's really useful.

822
00:54:39,230 --> 00:54:45,510
Scott: Right, it's like these completely garbage cards, but if you get the perfect combo with them, they're insane.

823
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:50,770
Scott: Like, there are some abilities that are like, yeah, add X damage to every attack.

824
00:54:50,990 --> 00:54:55,406
Scott: It's like, wait, so suddenly three zero strength attacks is now three.

825
00:54:55,466 --> 00:54:56,449
Scott: seventh strength attacks.

826
00:54:56,770 --> 00:54:58,470
Scott: Twenty-one damage, eat it, right?

827
00:54:59,132 --> 00:55:00,860
Scott: Which is a lot in this game.

828
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:03,130
Scott: Like, three damage is a lot in this game.

829
00:55:04,331 --> 00:55:08,325
Scott: Each battle is generally like, it takes a little while to wear out the enemy.

830
00:55:08,345 --> 00:55:09,770
Scott: You're not getting a lot of one-hit kills.

831
00:55:09,910 --> 00:55:14,190
Rym: And you're making a lot of honestly challenging tactical decisions.

832
00:55:14,871 --> 00:55:22,489
Rym: Like, do I eat some damage, or like, wear down my shields, but just go apeshit on that cockpit, because I already cracked the cockpit.

833
00:55:22,529 --> 00:55:22,870
Rym: It's weak.

834
00:55:24,271 --> 00:55:32,050
Scott: I think the luckiest I ever got was there's a guy you can visit who will rearrange the pieces of your ship randomly, and I always let him do it.

835
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:32,904
Rym: I always let him do it.

836
00:55:33,410 --> 00:55:37,463
Scott: He makes your hull stronger by two, and I'm like, yeah, all right, I'll deal with the rearrangement.

837
00:55:37,523 --> 00:55:39,530
Scott: Give me the two hull, which is HP.

838
00:55:40,271 --> 00:55:50,690
Scott: He put my cannon all the way on the right, and I was like, oh my god, I just hung out with only my cannon hitting the enemy, and the rest of my ship way to the left where the enemy couldn't hit it.

839
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:56,190
Scott: And I just kept moving left so that they couldn't hit me unless they hit me in the cannon, right?

840
00:55:56,530 --> 00:56:01,210
Scott: But it's like, only my cannon was just poking the right side of their ship, right?

841
00:56:01,911 --> 00:56:04,930
Scott: I won that one so easily with that setup.

842
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:08,606
Rym: So here's another example now of where this has surpassed FTL.

843
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:17,550
Rym: FTL, you get money, like scrap, over the course of the game, and it's kind of like fiddly random amounts, so you'll have some amount of this currency.

844
00:56:18,111 --> 00:56:28,090
Rym: And then you'll encounter shops, and you can buy things with the currency, but 90% of the time, you do not have enough currency to buy anything interesting that you want to buy.

845
00:56:28,773 --> 00:56:30,370
Rym: Or you're very limited in what you can buy.

846
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:35,810
Rym: In this game, if you come to a shop, the options always boil down to get a thing.

847
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:36,832
Rym: There's no currency.

848
00:56:36,952 --> 00:56:43,650
Rym: It's just get a thing, get a better thing, but pay some extra penalty for it, or do a different thing.

849
00:56:43,770 --> 00:56:49,490
Rym: Like, every option is equal but different, but you always get to avail the option.

850
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:58,808
Rym: You never get to a shop, and sorry, you only have 187 scrap, and the thing you want to buy costs 200, and everything that costs under 187 sucks.

851
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:01,579
Rym: Fuck you that FTL had.

852
00:57:02,103 --> 00:57:03,029
Scott: Every space is good.

853
00:57:03,210 --> 00:57:07,010
Scott: If something has a cost, and it's not free, it's always something you have.

854
00:57:07,630 --> 00:57:09,322
Scott: Alright, you can have this.

855
00:57:09,423 --> 00:57:10,450
Scott: I'll take one of your cards.

856
00:57:11,311 --> 00:57:12,539
Scott: Oh, you can have this.

857
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:14,290
Scott: I'm going to take some of your hull off your ship.

858
00:57:15,412 --> 00:57:20,090
Scott: You can have this, but you have to add a bunch of garbage cards to your deck, and then I'll let you have it.

859
00:57:20,090 --> 00:57:21,654
Rym: Do you want a free artifact?

860
00:57:22,035 --> 00:57:27,230
Rym: Do you want your choice of four artifacts, but I'm going to do some damage to you, or do you just want to heal yourself?

861
00:57:28,191 --> 00:57:32,344
Scott: Right, it's like there's always, basically, there's no separate currency.

862
00:57:32,585 --> 00:57:34,210
Scott: Every option is always possible.

863
00:57:35,050 --> 00:57:35,511
Rym: I love that.

864
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:41,443
Rym: That is a tabletop design pattern as opposed to a video game design pattern.

865
00:57:41,724 --> 00:57:44,530
Rym: I'm sick of fiddly currencies unless it's an 18xx game.

866
00:57:45,071 --> 00:57:48,450
Scott: You're making meaningful and tough decisions at every stop along the way.

867
00:57:48,731 --> 00:57:51,150
Rym: I'd say every decision you make in this game is meaningful.

868
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:53,307
Scott: Or at least, you know, it's tough.

869
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:57,307
Rym: It's like you have a shitty deck because you're stupid, and then you draw all bad cards.

870
00:57:57,327 --> 00:57:57,930
Rym: What are you going to do?

871
00:57:58,391 --> 00:58:00,067
Rym: That's one turn in a round.

872
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:01,372
Scott: You can get unlucky.

873
00:58:01,873 --> 00:58:16,210
Scott: So the last thing is the game has a plot, and the way the plot is revealed is that the three characters that you've chosen to go on your ship with you are chatting and interacting with all the people you meet along the way at all the different stops, including the enemies that you fight.

874
00:58:16,871 --> 00:58:24,590
Scott: And then when you beat one run, because it's roguelike, you choose one of the three characters in your ship to regain one of their memories.

875
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:28,810
Scott: Because basically it's that old trope of a time loop and everyone's lost all their memory.

876
00:58:29,390 --> 00:58:35,030
Scott: And so you can only choose one of the three characters that's on your ship to regain one of their memories.

877
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:43,070
Scott: And so in order to regain all the characters' memories, well, I said there's eight characters if you unlock them all, times three.

878
00:58:43,230 --> 00:58:46,877
Scott: So you have to beat the game 24 times, right?

879
00:58:46,897 --> 00:58:53,910
Scott: And you have to beat the game with each character in your ship three times each, right?

880
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:55,720
Scott: You can't ignore one of the characters.

881
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:57,430
Scott: You gotta go all of them, basically.

882
00:58:57,630 --> 00:59:00,310
Rym: Now thankfully all the characters are fun and useful and interesting.

883
00:59:00,471 --> 00:59:01,548
Scott: So far, at least.

884
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:03,810
Rym: Yeah, I don't have every character.

885
00:59:04,350 --> 00:59:06,186
Scott: Yeah, no, I think I have six out of eight.

886
00:59:06,408 --> 00:59:06,650
Scott: Anyway.

887
00:59:08,471 --> 00:59:11,498
Scott: But it's like, you have to do all that, and then I don't know what happens after that.

888
00:59:11,538 --> 00:59:16,710
Scott: There might be more content beyond that, but the story is being revealed as I play.

889
00:59:18,311 --> 00:59:23,990
Scott: And that gives it a lot of replay value, but it doesn't have the sort of insane replay value.

890
00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:30,708
Scott: I guess in some sense, you might say that Slay the Spire has more replay value, because like Rym said, to get every character to 20 takes a lot.

891
00:59:31,871 --> 00:59:39,050
Rym: But also, to get every character to 20, like to be clear, no matter how skilled you are at that game, it is a random game.

892
00:59:39,931 --> 00:59:43,750
Scott: No, but it's mostly like doing the same kind of thing.

893
00:59:43,990 --> 00:59:46,553
Rym: Yeah, like I'm playing the poison lady, and what am I doing?

894
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:50,898
Rym: I'm trying to do the poison thing, and I'm hoping I get the cards that let me do the poison thing.

895
01:00:01,590 --> 01:00:15,230
Scott: And then there's additional difficulty levels, I guess, but you're getting to this more complete end, but it's like there's more that drives you to keep playing than just beat the game with more difficult numbers.

896
01:00:15,330 --> 01:00:15,571
Rym: That is true.

897
01:00:15,591 --> 01:00:22,010
Rym: Like Slay the Spire, if I don't get the cards I want by the second floor, I'll just restart.

898
01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:26,230
Scott: But I mean, I'm talking about driving you to even launch the game and play it at all.

899
01:00:26,691 --> 01:00:40,068
Scott: It's like if you don't care about optimizing numbers, if you just beat Slay the Spire with one character, or like each character once, and you don't care about getting the high score or anything like that, then why would you beat it on a higher ascension?

900
01:00:40,109 --> 01:00:41,170
Scott: What's the incentive for you?

901
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:57,570
Scott: Whereas here, there's an incentive to story the characters, the more dramatically different setups and ships and things, there's more that makes you want to open and launch the game and try again than just, "Can I play the same game again with bigger numbers this

902
01:00:57,610 --> 01:00:57,750
Scott: time?".

903
01:00:57,790 --> 01:01:08,050
Rym: But also, Slay the Spire, choosing what cards to add to your deck is the only decision that matters other than the map if you know how to play the game and are good at it.

904
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:16,090
Rym: Like, you're not going to fuck up playing a round of a fight in Slay the Spire if you're even reasonably good at Slay the Spire.

905
01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:27,810
Rym: This game, no matter what you're doing and where you are in the game, every round of combat is a reasonably interesting decision with rare exceptions where you get a really bad draw occasionally.

906
01:01:28,292 --> 01:01:28,989
Scott: Or a really good draw.

907
01:01:29,110 --> 01:01:31,781
Rym: Or a really good draw like, "Yes, fire the Photonic

908
01:01:31,821 --> 01:01:32,162
Rym: Cannon.".

909
01:01:32,222 --> 01:01:34,110
Rym: Of course I'm firing the Photonic Cannon.

910
01:01:34,270 --> 01:01:36,480
Scott: Oh, I can play this card and win this battle.

911
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:37,444
Scott: I play it.

912
01:01:37,746 --> 01:01:38,288
Scott: Next battle.

913
01:01:38,348 --> 01:01:38,690
Scott: Let's go.

914
01:01:40,751 --> 01:01:56,310
Scott: If you enjoy a roguelike game, a deck-building game, a Slay the Spire-ish game, a single-player game, a game with cute pixelated space, animals, and ships, what's the full price of the game?

915
01:01:56,610 --> 01:01:57,175
Rym: I don't even know.

916
01:01:57,195 --> 01:01:57,801
Rym: Ten bucks?

917
01:01:57,841 --> 01:01:58,850
Rym: Like, it's not expensive.

918
01:01:59,170 --> 01:01:59,875
Scott: I'm checking right now.

919
01:01:59,896 --> 01:02:01,790
Scott: It's on Steam and it's on the Switch.

920
01:02:02,471 --> 01:02:08,561
Rym: I would advise, if you have a Switch, get it on the Switch because it has the same UX as Slay the Spire.

921
01:02:08,661 --> 01:02:14,070
Rym: It's really fast and easy to play on the Switch and I think you'll play it more if you can carry it with you.

922
01:02:15,031 --> 01:02:22,850
Scott: I would say that you should get it on Steam because we don't know when the Switch eShop will close and if you buy it on Steam, you will have this game forever.

923
01:02:23,050 --> 01:02:26,487
Rym: Well, I do own Slay the Spire on both the Switch and Steam, so...

924
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:32,074
Scott: If you really like spending money to buy a game two times, sure.

925
01:02:32,475 --> 01:02:34,376
Scott: Go knock yourself out.

926
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:36,799
Scott: I will always prioritize getting a game.

927
01:02:36,839 --> 01:02:49,770
Scott: If a game's on Steam, I'm getting it on Steam because Steam is 20+ years old and no Nintendo eShop has lasted more than like 10 years, so, you know, right?

928
01:02:51,011 --> 01:02:53,256
Rym: I'd say there's a 5% chance.

929
01:02:53,637 --> 01:02:58,470
Rym: the current iteration of the eShop is the one that'll just persist console to console forever.

930
01:02:58,830 --> 01:03:03,649
Scott: There does seem to be some hints that it will continue, but there are no guarantees and history has not...

931
01:03:04,630 --> 01:03:05,052
Rym: Hey, I said 5%!

932
01:03:05,052 --> 01:03:05,454
Rym: To be clear.

933
01:03:08,950 --> 01:03:09,170
Scott: So, yeah.

934
01:03:09,631 --> 01:03:12,156
Scott: There is a sale on Cobalt Core on Steam right now.

935
01:03:12,196 --> 01:03:12,857
Scott: It is $18 instead of $20.

936
01:03:12,857 --> 01:03:35,910
Scott: I would pay $20 no problem, but if you want to save... If you want to save $2, you have 18 hours from the time of this recording to go on Steam and buy a copy of Cobalt Core from developer Rocket Rat Games, who has also made what other games?

937
01:03:36,450 --> 01:03:39,618
Scott: Steam had an error and could not tell me what other games that they have made.

938
01:03:39,959 --> 01:03:40,359
Scott: Let me try.

939
01:03:40,420 --> 01:03:40,580
Scott: Nope!

940
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:41,683
Scott: They still can't tell me.

941
01:03:41,763 --> 01:03:42,966
Scott: Let's see what the publisher.

942
01:03:43,587 --> 01:03:44,730
Scott: Probably also an error.

943
01:03:45,050 --> 01:03:45,949
Rym: Brace yourself, I think?

944
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:46,652
Scott: Yes.

945
01:03:46,773 --> 01:03:47,801
Scott: Brace yourself, games.

946
01:03:47,862 --> 01:03:48,910
Scott: What else have they published?

947
01:03:49,275 --> 01:03:50,289
Rym: Crypt of the Necrodancer.

948
01:03:51,211 --> 01:03:51,815
Scott: That's a good one.

949
01:03:51,835 --> 01:03:53,525
Scott: Yep, it's just not loading.

950
01:03:53,585 --> 01:03:54,450
Scott: Alright, well, whatever.

951
01:03:57,111 --> 01:04:02,990
Scott: I give this game on Steam, I give it an extremely positive rating on Steam.

952
01:04:03,330 --> 01:04:05,156
Scott: I'd say it's great.

953
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:09,170
Rym: This is where you can't compare a game like this to Breath of the Wild.

954
01:04:09,690 --> 01:04:13,240
Rym: But for what this is, this is 10 out of 10 for what it is.

955
01:04:14,423 --> 01:04:16,830
Rym: If you like this kind of thing, 10 out of 10, no notes.

956
01:04:22,001 --> 01:04:24,247
Rym: This has been Geek Nights with Rym: and Scott.

957
01:04:24,287 --> 01:04:29,280
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

958
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:34,680
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

959
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:37,627
Rym: Remember, Geek Nights is not one, but four different shows.

960
01:04:37,747 --> 01:04:42,360
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

961
01:04:42,701 --> 01:04:45,876
Scott: Geek Nights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

962
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:50,230
Scott: Geek Nights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

963
01:04:50,411 --> 01:04:53,300
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

964
01:04:53,581 --> 01:05:09,820
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of Geek Nights are... ...a bunch of people who are under that $5 threshold, which is a totally fine place to be.

965
01:05:11,201 --> 01:05:12,926
Rym: Yeah, keep opening.

966
01:05:13,769 --> 01:05:17,220
Rym: Bugs, feedback, thoughts about the new website as we continue to tweak this.

967
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:22,320
Rym: This will be the first episode where, theoretically, the forum post will happen automatically.

968
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:24,799
Rym: We don't have to make it by hand, so we'll see what that looks like.

969
01:05:25,561 --> 01:05:33,760
Rym: So yeah, I leave you tonight, as I'm about to go play some Blades of the Dark with...

970
01:05:58,001 --> 01:06:00,979
Media: ...do this with our crew, unless the trap's useless if he's not feeling it.

971
01:06:01,643 --> 01:06:02,931
Media: But everyone is feeling it.

972
01:06:02,971 --> 01:06:04,239
Media: Do you even feel stuff right now?

973
01:06:05,364 --> 01:06:06,699
Media: Uh, here we go again.

974
01:06:07,601 --> 01:06:09,289
Media: Hey, what's the matter, fly guy?

975
01:06:09,330 --> 01:06:10,455
Media: Why you tryin' to puff me by?

976
01:06:10,495 --> 01:06:11,440
Media: No need to be shy.

977
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:15,219
Media: Come give me a try, 'cause I know you can't resist my exotic little vibes.

978
01:06:15,802 --> 01:06:17,197
Media: Marco, you are ruining the plan!

979
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:18,809
Media: Hold up, it's working.

980
01:06:19,031 --> 01:06:20,120
Media: Look at this wise man.
