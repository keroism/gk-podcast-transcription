00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,168
Rym: It's Thursday, September 28th, 2023.

2
00:00:10,168 --> 00:00:10,389
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,282 --> 00:00:13,719
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:14,943
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,963 --> 00:00:22,040
Rym: Tonight we are reviewing Janelle Monae's "The Age of Pleasure" tour as we saw at Radio City.

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,778
Scott: Let's do this!

7
00:00:25,161 --> 00:00:31,478
Rym: So the other night, we were hungry, busy, and we decided we should order some pizza, like you do.

8
00:00:31,538 --> 00:00:32,280
Rym: It's New York City.

9
00:00:32,861 --> 00:00:37,372
Rym: Lot of options for pizza, and we have like three or four places that we tend to rotate through.

10
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:40,600
Rym: that we know have good pizza or good kinds of pizza we like.

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,266
Scott: Why don't you rotate?

12
00:00:41,286 --> 00:00:42,860
Scott: Wouldn't one of them just be the best one?

13
00:00:43,681 --> 00:00:46,788
Rym: If I want a Sicilian style, we go order from Rizzo's.

14
00:00:46,868 --> 00:00:50,616
Rym: If I want like a fancy boutique pizza, we go to Milkflower.

15
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:52,560
Rym: Those are two different kinds of pizza.

16
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:53,520
Scott: Milkflower delivers to you, huh?

17
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,563
Rym: Oh yeah, it does.

18
00:00:54,644 --> 00:00:56,510
Rym: It's a problem, actually, that they deliver here.

19
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,076
Rym: It's a big problem.

20
00:00:58,096 --> 00:00:59,160
Rym: That's a real easy lunch.

21
00:00:59,361 --> 00:01:01,779
Scott: I thought they'd be far away for you to reach them.

22
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,953
Rym: Yeah, for whatever reason, they deliver to us, and I'm not going to complain about that.

23
00:01:05,015 --> 00:01:06,000
Rym: It arrives crazy hot.

24
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:12,474
Rym: So, uh, I decide, you know, I just look, let's see if there's anything that delivers.

25
00:01:12,955 --> 00:01:13,838
Rym: that I don't remember.

26
00:01:13,938 --> 00:01:14,620
Rym: Like something new.

27
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,219
Rym: And I go into the old group room.

28
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:16,900
Scott: Uh oh, danger.

29
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:18,642
Rym: Yeah, just to see.

30
00:01:19,283 --> 00:01:25,034
Rym: And I see that not too far away is a place that is definitely new that I've never seen before.

31
00:01:25,074 --> 00:01:27,960
Rym: They're called Detroit Pizza Works.

32
00:01:28,566 --> 00:01:29,920
Scott: Well, that doesn't sound good at all.

33
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:32,641
Rym: Now, that sounds great for me in that- You're in New York.

34
00:01:33,103 --> 00:01:34,085
Scott: First of all, you're in New York.

35
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:36,791
Scott: You're literally in New York City, living there.

36
00:01:37,272 --> 00:01:40,860
Scott: Why the hell would you want literally any city that's not New York pizza?

37
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,571
Rym: Honestly, you're weird about this.

38
00:01:42,591 --> 00:01:43,718
Scott: I like Chicago style pizza.

39
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,453
Scott: Can you imagine a California pizza kitchen opening up in New York?

40
00:01:47,473 --> 00:01:54,357
Rym: It's like that makes every other place- I know, but I'm just saying, it's in every other place- I mean, California pizza, the style is just bad pizza.

41
00:01:54,398 --> 00:01:54,619
Rym: It's not.

42
00:01:54,760 --> 00:02:04,800
Scott: Literally every place on the entire face of the earth that has pizza places, they call their place New York pizza, even if it's not New York pizza at all.

43
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:11,180
Scott: But there are places called New York pizza in basically every pizza eating country on the earth.

44
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,985
Scott: Yet, why?

45
00:02:13,085 --> 00:02:17,340
Scott: So if you're actually in real New York with real New York pizza, there is no reason.

46
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,726
Rym: Because I don't always want a New York style pizza.

47
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:21,289
Rym: I like a Chicago style pizza.

48
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:25,640
Rym: In fact, I even like the extremist form of Chicago style pizza.

49
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,102
Scott: The one where- I was in Chicago.

50
00:02:27,162 --> 00:02:35,660
Scott: so briefly, I was not able to eat the thing which may be delicious, looks delicious, but- I agree with you that- May semantically not be accurately called pizza.

51
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:57,539
Rym: I agree with you that calling Chicago style pizza, especially the most extreme form of it that's basically just like a three inch thick casserole with a top- I don't think calling that pizza makes sense, but regardless, Detroit style pizza is a distinct style of pizza that I do enjoy.

52
00:02:57,559 --> 00:02:58,060
Rym: I like it.

53
00:02:58,741 --> 00:03:02,891
Rym: It's got some attributes, but you can make good and bad Detroit style pizza.

54
00:03:02,911 --> 00:03:04,014
Rym: You wouldn't even have to call it Detroit.

55
00:03:04,034 --> 00:03:06,380
Rym: That's just the place that kind of was popular for a lot of reasons.

56
00:03:06,901 --> 00:03:09,285
Rym: But anyway, I think, oh, Detroit style pizza.

57
00:03:09,686 --> 00:03:16,420
Rym: Because on that century I did a while ago, I bumped into a bunch of people who were biking up near Poughkeepsie on the train home.

58
00:03:17,061 --> 00:03:31,819
Rym: And a couple of them were from Detroit and they told me about a place down by the village called Lions Tigers and Squares that sells just Detroit style pizza and is Detroit themed around the Detroit sports teams.

59
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:32,880
Rym: It's like a whole thing going on.

60
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,760
Scott: And I asked them like- I guess as a Detroit person who moved to New York for some reason.

61
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:37,021
Scott: Yeah.

62
00:03:37,444 --> 00:03:45,120
Scott: So they got a bunch of Red Wings shit all over the walls and Tigers- If they love Detroit so much, I guess, you know, do they really love Detroit that much if they keep their living here?

63
00:03:45,482 --> 00:03:48,920
Rym: I mean, I love Detroit, but I want to live in New York.

64
00:03:50,061 --> 00:03:51,404
Scott: There are like people like that.

65
00:03:51,464 --> 00:04:03,060
Scott: Like any city you go to, you'll always find like these people who are from somewhere else and like express, you know, love and- The old country, like I agree, the family from Sicily with the pizza.

66
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,723
Scott: To where they're from, right?

67
00:04:04,924 --> 00:04:07,269
Scott: And it's like, all right, you know, I see that.

68
00:04:07,369 --> 00:04:12,700
Scott: But it's like, if you really like where you're from, why are you not, you know, living there?

69
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,231
Rym: Some people are refugees.

70
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:17,046
Rym: Like say you really like- That's a real reason.

71
00:04:17,267 --> 00:04:20,839
Scott: I'm talking about, you know, the people who don't appear to have a real reason.

72
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,300
Rym: Or what if you like Detroit, but there ain't no jobs there because of capitalism?

73
00:04:27,361 --> 00:04:31,259
Rym: I mean, you know- I mean, you and I are in New York for a lot of reasons.

74
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:39,620
Scott: I feel like though, if New York Detroited and Detroit New Yorked, that I'd stay in New York, even if it was Detroity.

75
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:40,482
Rym: It would depend.

76
00:04:40,622 --> 00:04:42,547
Rym: It would really depend.

77
00:04:42,828 --> 00:04:44,452
Rym: The problem is New York is unique.

78
00:04:44,813 --> 00:04:46,336
Rym: You know, that whole Alpha Global City thing.

79
00:04:46,397 --> 00:04:47,800
Rym: Only London and New York are in that category.

80
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,059
Scott: Yeah, that's why it's better.

81
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,526
Rym: Yeah, but because New York has a subway system.

82
00:04:52,807 --> 00:04:54,410
Rym: Like, nobody has this.

83
00:04:54,611 --> 00:04:58,179
Rym: Anyway, so I wonder, oh, I wonder if it's a thing like that.

84
00:04:58,821 --> 00:05:11,460
Rym: But I also am cautious because as my reputation precedes me among our friends and for the listeners of this show, I am cynical, jaded, pessimistic, and cautious.

85
00:05:12,042 --> 00:05:15,373
Rym: I am willing to bail the drop of a hat on anything.

86
00:05:15,393 --> 00:05:17,460
Rym: I don't trust anything I see on the internet.

87
00:05:18,381 --> 00:05:25,040
Rym: So I think, alright, let's make sure this isn't a ghost kitchen because a lot of restaurants on Grubhub are ghost kitchens.

88
00:05:27,281 --> 00:05:35,320
Scott: The name like that, especially since I haven't seen it, I haven't seen the storefront, I would bet ghost kitchens.

89
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,189
Rym: Oh yeah, so I type it into Google Maps and there are no results.

90
00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:43,800
Rym: In fact, all it recommends is that Lions, Tigers, and Squares place in the village.

91
00:05:45,641 --> 00:05:49,532
Rym: Alright, so I give them the benefit of the doubt and I decide, what if they're just brand new?

92
00:05:49,592 --> 00:05:52,580
Rym: So I actually look at the address that's registered in Grubhub.

93
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,723
Scott: That's going to tell you exactly what it is, right?

94
00:05:55,825 --> 00:06:00,291
Scott: Because even the diner that's a block away from us.

95
00:06:00,812 --> 00:06:06,200
Scott: that was just on Kitchen Nightmares, I haven't seen the episode.

96
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,065
Scott: I'm going to try to see it because I don't hate that show.

97
00:06:09,606 --> 00:06:16,680
Scott: But even if I hated the show, I'd probably still watch the episode about the diner a block away from us that we've eaten at many times.

98
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:24,734
Scott: But anyway, even them, they operate like 100 ghost kitchen entries in Grubhub, right?

99
00:06:24,794 --> 00:06:26,577
Scott: But they all use the same address.

100
00:06:26,597 --> 00:06:28,240
Scott: so you know exactly that it's them.

101
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:40,000
Rym: There's a ton of ghost kitchens that have an address that's basically a parking lot kind of under the Queensborough Bridge and if you sort Grubhub by distance from you, you see a lot of really cagey shit.

102
00:06:42,422 --> 00:06:49,838
Rym: So I look on Google Maps, I go to the address and it's kind of by the Astoria Kaufman Theaters and I'm thinking, there's no pizza place there.

103
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:55,027
Rym: Like did a pizza place- There's a Napoli- no, there's literally the- Hold on, there's pizza places.

104
00:06:55,108 --> 00:07:01,091
Rym: I knew about there who I was confident- There's sacks that's underneath, literally right over there.

105
00:07:01,292 --> 00:07:02,275
Scott: There's the Napoli one.

106
00:07:02,295 --> 00:07:03,680
Scott: that's a few blocks away.

107
00:07:04,081 --> 00:07:10,280
Rym: Like a place a pizza place would go that didn't already have a pizza place that I was pretty sure didn't go out of business since the last time I was over there.

108
00:07:10,701 --> 00:07:17,159
Scott: But the point is yes, I know that area, I know the pizza places that are near that area, there are a few, and none of them are Detroit pizza places.

109
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,660
Rym: And I feel like I would've noticed the last time I was over there.

110
00:07:21,142 --> 00:07:22,040
Scott: I was there recently.

111
00:07:23,001 --> 00:07:31,900
Rym: So then I do the old Google Street View and I drop my little yellow guy in the Google Street View and what do I fucking see at that address?

112
00:07:32,461 --> 00:07:33,817
Rym: A Pizzeria Uno!

113
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,620
Scott: Yeah, it's the one next to the Applebee's.

114
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,179
Rym: Yup, it's the one next to the Applebee's.

115
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:44,120
Scott: Literally, Astoria is interesting in that all of Astoria, we don't really have- like there's a couple McDonald's.

116
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,496
Scott: Even Wildwood has the McDonald's.

117
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,204
Scott: Duncan Donuts is, right?

118
00:07:48,244 --> 00:07:52,980
Scott: But for the most part, I guess there's a Chipotle now and a Target, right?

119
00:07:53,321 --> 00:07:54,083
Scott: But it's like.

120
00:07:54,103 --> 00:07:58,980
Scott: yes, there are those businesses that are chains, but actually they're like few and far between.

121
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:07,100
Scott: Like we're talking like one or two per street and every other business on all the streets is some sort of New York-y business.

122
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:10,857
Scott: They might be chains, but they're not those big chains that are like that.

123
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:20,140
Scott: But in that one area, there's an Applebee's, a Panera, and an Uno Pizzeria all right next to each other in that one spot.

124
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:25,520
Rym: Yup, and they're all clustered by a big parking garage that people drive to and park to go to the theater and eat out.

125
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:36,380
Scott: Right, it's like this one spot that's like a little suburb that's like the border of Astoria and the rest of, you know, further east Queens.

126
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:38,777
Scott: Has all this suburb shit all gathered.

127
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,299
Rym: Against my better nature.

128
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:44,159
Scott: Huddling together for safety against, you know, real life.

129
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:48,780
Rym: But against my chorus nature, I decide to go one step further.

130
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,428
Rym: Don't worry, I didn't order this fucking pizza.

131
00:08:50,448 --> 00:08:52,015
Rym: Like do not think this is where this is going.

132
00:08:52,096 --> 00:08:52,920
Rym: I am not stupid.

133
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:59,860
Rym: But I wonder for a brief second, the bears glimmer of hope that I decide to entertain instead of crush.

134
00:09:00,681 --> 00:09:03,656
Rym: What if the Uno somehow went out of business and I didn't notice?

135
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:04,540
Rym: because why would I notice?

136
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,060
Scott: No, it definitely is still there.

137
00:09:06,201 --> 00:09:06,896
Rym: And someone bought it.

138
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,260
Scott: Because I've never eaten there, obviously.

139
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,428
Rym: Because I don't see Uno.

140
00:09:10,469 --> 00:09:13,360
Rym: It's one of those things like a billboard where my brain just ad blocks it.

141
00:09:13,521 --> 00:09:14,200
Rym: I don't even think about it.

142
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:14,758
Scott: No, it's there.

143
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:20,718
Rym: It's like that scene in Westworld where she looks at the picture of the outside world and she's like, "Doesn't look like anything at all to

144
00:09:20,758 --> 00:09:20,919
Rym: me.".

145
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:27,007
Rym: So I Google for Detroit Pizza Kitchen and I will not link to this website because it is like.

146
00:09:27,908 --> 00:09:38,626
Rym: every reference to this place that I can find is on a website like Pizza Marketplace that is aimed at SEO nonsense and people who are in the bad pizza business.

147
00:09:38,827 --> 00:09:43,640
Rym: Like someone who's like an executive at a place that invests in Sbarro's type garbage.

148
00:09:44,981 --> 00:09:51,220
Rym: And yeah, Uno decided to make a bunch of ghost kitchens not associated with their brand to sell Detroit style pizza.

149
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,747
Rym: And this article had a picture of the pizza they're selling.

150
00:09:55,368 --> 00:10:00,760
Rym: And that does not look even remotely like a Detroit style pizza.

151
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,478
Rym: It looks exactly like a regular ass fucking Pizzeria Uno pizza with no changes.

152
00:10:09,303 --> 00:10:09,966
Rym: So there you have it.

153
00:10:10,247 --> 00:10:11,111
Rym: Do not order.

154
00:10:11,292 --> 00:10:13,019
Rym: Detroit Pizza Works pizza.

155
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,360
Scott: Yeah, so what I have to say about Pizzeria Uno is that when I was young, and we loved pizza, and we were from New York.

156
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,939
Rym: And when I was young, I would eat any pizza.

157
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,068
Scott: We were people from New York living in Connecticut, you know.

158
00:10:23,409 --> 00:10:24,331
Scott: We had pizza.

159
00:10:24,492 --> 00:10:25,775
Scott: We knew what good pizza was.

160
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,540
Scott: We knew the best pizzas in Connecticut.

161
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,464
Scott: Yeah, I grew up in Detroit.

162
00:10:28,484 --> 00:10:32,040
Rym: We would go sit down at the Pizza Hut to eat pizza sometimes.

163
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:35,589
Scott: And Pizzeria Uno opened in, I think, Fairfield.

164
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,653
Scott: And it was big.

165
00:10:36,673 --> 00:10:39,040
Scott: It was this big place, you know, physically.

166
00:10:39,821 --> 00:10:40,503
Scott: And it was new.

167
00:10:40,683 --> 00:10:41,726
Scott: We hadn't seen it before.

168
00:10:41,787 --> 00:10:43,231
Scott: We didn't realize it was a chain.

169
00:10:43,271 --> 00:10:46,320
Scott: We thought it was, or if it was a chain, it felt like it was the first one.

170
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,130
Scott: Sort of like when Blockbuster first showed up.

171
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,680
Scott: It was around that same time, I think.

172
00:10:50,761 --> 00:10:53,072
Scott: Where it's like this big new video store opened up.

173
00:10:53,112 --> 00:10:54,720
Scott: We didn't realize it was a chain yet.

174
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:59,250
Scott: It was like the only one that we had ever seen or ever heard of.

175
00:10:59,712 --> 00:11:02,278
Scott: So we were like, oh, a giant new pizza place.

176
00:11:02,298 --> 00:11:03,300
Scott: Let's go check that out.

177
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,683
Scott: We're kind of excited, right?

178
00:11:04,723 --> 00:11:05,705
Scott: Like, ooh, right?

179
00:11:05,725 --> 00:11:12,180
Scott: You know, and I get there and the pizza was, even when I was a kid, and it was like, this is terrible.

180
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,263
Scott: This is right.

181
00:11:13,303 --> 00:11:18,740
Scott: Because I guess I had already, even at that young single digit age, had a taste for New York pizza.

182
00:11:19,141 --> 00:11:26,300
Rym: Now, there was a time in my life around middle school where the only thing that mattered in terms of food to me was quantity.

183
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:34,680
Scott: I think this was pre-middle school, but regardless, literally, can you imagine a kid eating a pizza and being like, ew, I don't want this.

184
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,191
Scott: A kid who likes pizza and ate pizza from other places.

185
00:11:39,712 --> 00:11:42,360
Scott: I didn't start hating pizza altogether or anything.

186
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:49,740
Rym: Like if I was forced to stack rank restaurants, there are restaurants where I would eat at the Uno before I would eat at them.

187
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:53,860
Rym: But you're already at the bottom of the barrel next to Burger King and Jack in the Box.

188
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,444
Scott: Right, yeah.

189
00:11:56,845 --> 00:12:02,780
Scott: So since that time, single digit age, last millennium, I have managed to, I guess it wasn't that hard.

190
00:12:03,281 --> 00:12:09,440
Scott: I have never eaten at an Uno's Pizzeria since then, and I have no plans to for the rest of my days.

191
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:13,459
Rym: So yeah, you got any news?

192
00:12:14,581 --> 00:12:17,100
Scott: Yeah, we got camera-related news and thing of the day.

193
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:25,900
Scott: So, Nikons, I guess semi-surprised everyone except for all of the people who do camera reviews, because they all got preview units.

194
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:30,789
Scott: They announced this new camera called the Nikon ZF.

195
00:12:32,012 --> 00:12:35,040
Scott: So this came out of nowhere, basically, at least as far as I could tell.

196
00:12:36,482 --> 00:12:41,057
Scott: It is something that people kind of wanted, because there was a previous camera, the Nikon ZF-C.

197
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:57,880
Scott: And what the ZF-C was, was sort of a unique camera in that the shape of the camera physically, the interface of it, if you didn't get close to it, you'd think it was an old film SLR camera with the dials on it and everything, right?

198
00:12:58,522 --> 00:13:01,820
Scott: Only slightly smaller and obviously digital.

199
00:13:03,261 --> 00:13:11,840
Scott: But it had an APS-C size sensor, which if you didn't know, is bigger than a Micro Four Thirds sensor, but smaller than a "full frame" sensor.

200
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:15,994
Scott: Full frame is basically the size of a frame on a 35mm film negative, right?

201
00:13:19,281 --> 00:13:32,020
Scott: And so, that was a cool camera, the Nikon ZF-C, but it wasn't that inspiring for people to go get it, because the quality of the actual photos was decent.

202
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:39,100
Scott: It was cool looking, right interface, right shape, but it was kind of plasticky, right?

203
00:13:40,022 --> 00:13:57,258
Scott: It was like, if you're making a camera in that shape of old school controls, you're appealing to people who care about photos, so putting technology in it that is not somewhat high end makes those people go, "Well, I like the shape, but...".

204
00:13:59,241 --> 00:14:10,060
Scott: So, sort of dominating that space, there are surprisingly few higher end digital cameras that have an old school user interface, right?

205
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,229
Scott: Basically, Fuji makes those, right?

206
00:14:13,369 --> 00:14:14,974
Scott: And the X100 that I have is like an old ragefinder.

207
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:22,359
Scott: The X-Pro3 is discontinued, we're waiting for an X-Pro4, which I might buy if they ever make one.

208
00:14:22,921 --> 00:14:25,250
Scott: Then there's the XT whatevers, right?

209
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:28,040
Scott: Those are sort of the same, they look like old school SLRs.

210
00:14:28,681 --> 00:14:33,960
Scott: And then, of course, there's the $10,000 Leica cameras, which look like our old school rangefinders.

211
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,604
Scott: And that's pretty much it, that's it.

212
00:14:35,644 --> 00:14:41,280
Scott: That's the list of cameras that are modern digital cameras, but are in the shape of an old camera.

213
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,820
Scott: All the other digital cameras are basically the shape of a digital camera, right?

214
00:14:47,101 --> 00:14:50,532
Scott: Which, you know, why are digital cameras that shape?

215
00:14:50,653 --> 00:14:52,780
Scott: Is that the best shape a camera can be, right?

216
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,260
Scott: That's sort of the question that's being challenged, right?

217
00:14:55,982 --> 00:15:01,060
Rym: Well, remember, there was a bunch of cameras that were basically just a lens, like a little sensor on it.

218
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,030
Scott: Oh, but those are video cameras.

219
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:05,000
Scott: You can't use that for photography, really, right?

220
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:10,040
Scott: You need some sort of either optical or digital viewfinder to do, and some sort of interface.

221
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,900
Scott: You know, when you have a camera that's just a box, it's because you're controlling it from far away.

222
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:19,639
Rym: But it might be boxed with that little grippy on the right side is like one of those U.X.

223
00:15:19,659 --> 00:15:20,020
Rym: designs.

224
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:26,440
Scott: Yeah, but there's still all the, you do photography where you're walking around, you need all the controls on the thing.

225
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,325
Scott: That's not what those are for.

226
00:15:28,425 --> 00:15:32,160
Scott: Anyway, those are for video and film and things of that nature.

227
00:15:32,421 --> 00:15:35,500
Scott: I mean, not that these cameras don't do video, they all do because of digital cameras.

228
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,559
Scott: So the Nikon ZF, they come out and they're like, all right, here it is.

229
00:15:40,202 --> 00:15:44,740
Scott: It's like the Nikon ZFC, only bigger with the thirty five millimeter sensor.

230
00:15:46,302 --> 00:15:46,523
Scott: Right.

231
00:15:46,543 --> 00:15:49,151
Scott: And fancier and et cetera.

232
00:15:49,232 --> 00:15:51,880
Scott: And people and it's only two thousand dollars.

233
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,995
Scott: Now, two thousand dollars is a lot of money in just the scheme of things.

234
00:15:56,035 --> 00:15:57,400
Scott: That's like a computer.

235
00:15:58,341 --> 00:15:58,601
Scott: Right.

236
00:15:59,343 --> 00:16:08,580
Scott: But if you compare that to basically the competition, you know, the Fuji X-T5 is seventeen hundred dollars.

237
00:16:08,841 --> 00:16:10,807
Scott: And this has a bigger sensor than that.

238
00:16:10,907 --> 00:16:11,148
Scott: Right.

239
00:16:11,609 --> 00:16:14,097
Scott: The Nikon Z six two.

240
00:16:14,117 --> 00:16:14,217
Scott: Right.

241
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,893
Scott: Which is basically the equivalent Nikon is.

242
00:16:18,054 --> 00:16:19,300
Scott: it has a like a lot of hope.

243
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:24,740
Scott: They do the thing where they have like the same camera and they go mega time, mega tea, right.

244
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,565
Scott: Slightly better upgrades.

245
00:16:26,846 --> 00:16:30,940
Scott: So it's like this, the Z nine, the Z eight, the Z seven, the Z six, the Z five.

246
00:16:31,401 --> 00:16:32,243
Scott: And right.

247
00:16:32,504 --> 00:16:34,169
Scott: And they're all slightly better.

248
00:16:34,269 --> 00:16:38,180
Scott: You know, basically, as the number goes down, the camera gets slightly worse and slightly cheaper.

249
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:45,540
Scott: The ZF is basically the same as the Z six to only a little bit better than that, actually.

250
00:16:45,941 --> 00:16:48,146
Scott: But it's the same price as the Z six two.

251
00:16:48,988 --> 00:16:54,100
Scott: And it has a. you know, in my opinion, I'd rather have the old school control shape than the digital camera shape.

252
00:16:54,780 --> 00:17:02,760
Rym: So, yeah, it's like a really good to grad with no lens and the two default lens options don't look too bad based on my skin.

253
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:06,270
Scott: Yeah, you would say I think you would take the 40 millimeter one point.

254
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:09,720
Rym: I feel like that's the one I would take if I was going to get that's the one that goes with it.

255
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,742
Scott: Right.

256
00:17:10,762 --> 00:17:16,359
Scott: So it's like this whole there isn't really like a competitor for this camera.

257
00:17:16,521 --> 00:17:16,701
Scott: Right.

258
00:17:16,741 --> 00:17:21,079
Scott: It's like if you want the full frame sensor, well, Fuji doesn't have that.

259
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:27,760
Scott: Fuji does either smaller sensors, APC or Fuji does big sensor, medium format.

260
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,468
Scott: They have a they're sort of not trying to compete with.

261
00:17:30,668 --> 00:17:34,720
Rym: like a medium format is the same effective scale as a medium tank.

262
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:35,829
Rym: When you talk about tanks.

263
00:17:36,616 --> 00:17:37,019
Scott: Exactly.

264
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:42,580
Rym: Because this large format and then there's four by five, there's mega tank.

265
00:17:43,461 --> 00:17:43,642
Scott: Yeah.

266
00:17:43,682 --> 00:17:49,320
Scott: You can get a camera that takes photos that are just the net, you know, eight and a half by eleven, like boom, paper size.

267
00:17:50,407 --> 00:17:51,478
Scott: You could do bigger than that, too.

268
00:17:51,881 --> 00:17:59,140
Scott: Anyway, basically anything bigger than medium format is just called large at the even though there's many, many.

269
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:03,220
Scott: But regardless, for quote, full frame is thirty five millimeter.

270
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:03,681
Scott: Right.

271
00:18:03,721 --> 00:18:05,002
Scott: Which is whoever came up with.

272
00:18:05,103 --> 00:18:17,580
Scott: deciding to call that full is like a marketing genius because they basically by calling that by using the word full, they in every photographer's mind, they've made anything smaller than that feel inferior.

273
00:18:17,741 --> 00:18:18,986
Scott: The same thing happened.

274
00:18:19,047 --> 00:18:21,940
Scott: I read anything bigger than that feel excessive.

275
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,144
Rym: I read an essay years ago that made an argument.

276
00:18:24,164 --> 00:18:32,500
Rym: It was talking about marketing and it was talking about how calling it a high definition HD, regardless of, you know, seven, twenty one, ten, eighty, like all that nonsense.

277
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:40,380
Rym: That was the death knell to the previous generation of all displays, regardless of if the technology actually looked better yet.

278
00:18:41,261 --> 00:18:42,746
Scott: I mean, you look, Apple ran out of words.

279
00:18:42,766 --> 00:18:44,471
Scott: They're already at ultra Apple watches.

280
00:18:44,571 --> 00:18:45,273
Scott: It's like, that's it.

281
00:18:45,433 --> 00:18:47,660
Scott: We don't have words bigger than that done.

282
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:49,363
Scott: Fine.

283
00:18:49,403 --> 00:18:51,815
Scott: This is really the final watch.

284
00:18:51,936 --> 00:18:52,720
Rym: Final format.

285
00:18:53,301 --> 00:18:56,860
Scott: The point is, if you want a camera, the fatal for this sensor size.

286
00:18:57,421 --> 00:18:57,662
Scott: Right.

287
00:18:57,722 --> 00:18:58,767
Scott: There are many to choose from.

288
00:18:58,948 --> 00:19:01,600
Scott: If you want a digital camera with the sensor size, many to choose from.

289
00:19:02,081 --> 00:19:08,460
Scott: But if you want one with this sensor size, that is an old school shape with the dials and whatever.

290
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:15,860
Scott: The only options are this, which is SLR shaped and the Leica, the Leica, which is rangefinder shaped.

291
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:20,660
Scott: So if you're oh, if you're going to narrow it to SLR shaped, this is a unique camera, right?

292
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:26,119
Scott: There is no existing camera that combines those elements together other than this.

293
00:19:26,741 --> 00:19:28,428
Rym: Now I'm looking up at staring at me.

294
00:19:28,508 --> 00:19:31,259
Rym: on my desk is my ancient DX1 that I'm still using.

295
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:38,540
Scott: So, yeah, so it's like I'm sort of waiting, like, you know, the X100, which is the Fuji rangefinder with the smaller sensor.

296
00:19:38,821 --> 00:19:39,002
Scott: Right.

297
00:19:39,042 --> 00:19:43,460
Scott: Of all the cameras I have, I use that camera more than all the others combined.

298
00:19:44,981 --> 00:19:45,944
Scott: But you can't even get.

299
00:19:45,964 --> 00:19:52,380
Scott: they have the X100V, which came out a while ago, which is it's such a hot item right now.

300
00:19:52,661 --> 00:19:54,869
Scott: Like I bought the X100F before they were hot.

301
00:19:54,909 --> 00:19:55,130
Scott: Right.

302
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:57,177
Scott: It's like the X100V is so hot.

303
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:57,799
Scott: You can't get them.

304
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,927
Scott: People are you know, you could probably sell.

305
00:20:01,308 --> 00:20:05,160
Scott: you could buy sell one for more than it costs you to buy it right now because it's so hot.

306
00:20:06,861 --> 00:20:12,279
Scott: And it's like, you know, I use that camera the most, but it's getting a little long in the tooth.

307
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:12,480
Scott: Right.

308
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,946
Scott: It's not getting the updates.

309
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:15,672
Scott: It doesn't have the USB-C.

310
00:20:15,753 --> 00:20:17,580
Scott: It doesn't work with the new Fuji app.

311
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:22,240
Scott: It, you know, features on the newer ones that I kind of actually would use.

312
00:20:22,881 --> 00:20:24,567
Scott: So it's like, you know, I'm waiting.

313
00:20:24,748 --> 00:20:27,940
Scott: But then this camera comes along and it's like, hey, you sure you want to keep waiting?

314
00:20:28,021 --> 00:20:29,959
Scott: And I'm like, oh, well, I don't know.

315
00:20:31,341 --> 00:20:40,800
Scott: I think what I'm going to do is I'll wait, you know, for this to actually show up at the camera store in a couple of months rather than throw two thousand dollars on a purchase of something I can't touch.

316
00:20:41,121 --> 00:20:41,261
Rym: Right.

317
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:41,944
Rym: That's a good idea.

318
00:20:42,406 --> 00:20:45,360
Scott: And I'll go I'll go play with one for free and see what the deal is.

319
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:45,601
Scott: Right.

320
00:20:45,621 --> 00:20:51,360
Scott: But yeah, this is an interesting surprise camera out of nowhere.

321
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:56,238
Scott: So it's worth noting even to not camera people to be like, you know.

322
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:57,801
Rym: Yeah.

323
00:20:58,402 --> 00:21:08,360
Rym: So in some other news, and we won't dwell on these because these both of these could be like their own show and you should just go to the real news media to learn about what happened.

324
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:11,779
Rym: So first, the the writers strike is over.

325
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,809
Rym: The WGA has voted to lift the strike order.

326
00:21:14,829 --> 00:21:17,680
Rym: The strike lasted one hundred and forty eight days.

327
00:21:18,301 --> 00:21:22,439
Scott: And by all accounts, imagine not getting paid for one hundred and forty eight days.

328
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,846
Scott: Would you be able to make it?

329
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:25,395
Rym: I would.

330
00:21:25,455 --> 00:21:26,199
Rym: But right.

331
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,290
Scott: But and how much suffering for would that be?

332
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:31,980
Scott: And would you go through that suffering?

333
00:21:32,681 --> 00:21:32,983
Scott: Right.

334
00:21:33,185 --> 00:21:33,829
Scott: Is it worth it?

335
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:35,520
Scott: And it's like, well, I got the right outcome.

336
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:41,000
Rym: I mean, think about as young kids often don't remember and don't pay attention to middle school.

337
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:50,260
Rym: The only reason we have weekends off is because a whole bunch of union people basically suffered getting attacked and murdered by Pinkertons for a long time.

338
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,960
Scott: So it's like you had to be thankful to the people and respectful.

339
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:54,520
Scott: Right.

340
00:21:54,540 --> 00:22:01,520
Scott: And and, you know, glory to them that they have, you know, they suffered greatly to to bring about this good end.

341
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,066
Scott: But also think about yourself.

342
00:22:03,206 --> 00:22:04,551
Scott: It's like you want to.

343
00:22:04,692 --> 00:22:06,960
Scott: you want to have good ends and change the world.

344
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,478
Scott: It's like you had to be ready to do that kind of suffering.

345
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:09,700
Scott: Right.

346
00:22:10,021 --> 00:22:13,280
Rym: So so you can read the details when the time comes.

347
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:24,440
Rym: The key gains are really important because what's fascinating is the last time there was a strike in this space, it sort of resolved as a compromise where nobody was super happy, but it was like a slight step forward.

348
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:29,540
Rym: All the writers I see talking about this are saying this is like transformative.

349
00:22:30,383 --> 00:22:34,780
Rym: It was a complete and total victory, which is not the rhetoric I expected.

350
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,446
Scott: But you don't see that too often.

351
00:22:36,547 --> 00:22:38,720
Scott: Usually you see a pretty big compromise.

352
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,080
Rym: Yeah.

353
00:22:39,101 --> 00:22:43,240
Rym: Well, meanwhile, UAW, remember the autoworkers, one of their demands is four day workweek.

354
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,149
Scott: So, yeah, that's right.

355
00:22:45,672 --> 00:22:47,200
Rym: So key points.

356
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:47,720
Rym: Go.

357
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:59,360
Rym: The writers rooms have minimum sizes now and TV show like minimum staffing levels, payment terms for screenwriters, guaranteed second looks and follow ups, all the stuff that makes sure writers actually get paid.

358
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,703
Rym: Which was not happening.

359
00:23:02,246 --> 00:23:08,500
Rym: Huge, huge limitations on where and how I can be used in the process at any point.

360
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:19,500
Rym: Companies basically can't use anyone's writing output for fucking anything without their explicit written approval, their statutory rules around where and how they could even give that approval.

361
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:20,783
Rym: There's a whole.

362
00:23:20,803 --> 00:23:25,180
Rym: it's almost all the talking points here are around restrictions on how I can be used.

363
00:23:25,901 --> 00:23:26,061
Scott: Yep.

364
00:23:26,441 --> 00:23:41,900
Scott: My only concern is that, you know, this guarantees basically that if someone is going to produce some Hollywood media that is written and requires writing, you know, and they're going to use union labor, which they are.

365
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,662
Scott: Because otherwise you're going to be.

366
00:23:43,682 --> 00:23:44,543
Scott: all the other unions are.

367
00:23:44,563 --> 00:23:45,044
Scott: It's going to.

368
00:23:45,064 --> 00:23:45,945
Scott: you're not going to work out.

369
00:23:45,965 --> 00:23:46,146
Scott: Right.

370
00:23:46,526 --> 00:23:46,707
Scott: Yeah.

371
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:57,708
Rym: I think in our lifetime there won't be.

372
00:23:57,748 --> 00:24:01,180
Rym: there will be entire Hollywood movies made without a single human being involved.

373
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:04,964
Scott: I'm just saying, even if they don't use the eyes of the M.L.

374
00:24:05,104 --> 00:24:05,705
Scott: right.

375
00:24:05,765 --> 00:24:18,920
Scott: I really don't like saying I even if they don't use machine learning tools to do to replace writers, they are going to drastically reduce the amount of written content produced.

376
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:24,530
Scott: And they're going to continue to increase their focus on the non-written content.

377
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:24,871
Scott: Yep.

378
00:24:25,251 --> 00:24:26,393
Scott: Right.

379
00:24:26,654 --> 00:24:30,200
Scott: And if you look at television, I think especially right.

380
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,164
Scott: You know, the NFL is the only thing keeping cable alive.

381
00:24:34,284 --> 00:24:34,465
Scott: Yeah.

382
00:24:34,545 --> 00:24:44,520
Rym: And for those of you who don't live sports in general, non-written content is is code for sports and reality TV, except for pro wrestling is written.

383
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,021
Rym: Oh, yeah.

384
00:24:45,682 --> 00:24:46,603
Scott: But not other sports.

385
00:24:46,743 --> 00:24:46,924
Scott: Right.

386
00:24:46,984 --> 00:24:57,540
Scott: And but yeah, it's like, you know, you look around and it's like a lot of the stuff that's, you know, carrying the load, especially television is not written.

387
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:11,380
Scott: So well, because the underlying reasons I wonder how many writers it's like, I think, you know, I wonder it's like the writers who are still going to be working are going to be treated properly.

388
00:25:12,041 --> 00:25:12,261
Scott: Right.

389
00:25:12,342 --> 00:25:13,163
Scott: With this new deal.

390
00:25:13,443 --> 00:25:16,809
Scott: I wonder how many writers won't be able to find work.

391
00:25:16,889 --> 00:25:18,612
Rym: That is the same concern.

392
00:25:18,632 --> 00:25:21,897
Scott: There is less money going out to writer.

393
00:25:21,957 --> 00:25:23,660
Scott: They just have less jobs now.

394
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,262
Scott: They just decrease the that.

395
00:25:25,363 --> 00:25:30,371
Rym: So one, that is the right wing's primary talking point against unions that it causes that outcome.

396
00:25:31,633 --> 00:25:35,960
Rym: But to it is a real concern, but they're they're concerned for fake reasons, of course.

397
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:40,947
Rym: Like, don't fuck the right wing, but obviously that is how all of labor is gone.

398
00:25:40,987 --> 00:25:49,580
Rym: Look at how labor is going now, which there are jobs that still pay a lot and are highly skilled and require people like people like us to do this kind of work.

399
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,142
Rym: There aren't that many of them.

400
00:25:52,042 --> 00:25:54,545
Rym: And most people, there's no jobs for them.

401
00:25:54,685 --> 00:25:56,747
Rym: And if they can even find a job, it pays fucking nothing.

402
00:25:57,368 --> 00:26:08,720
Rym: And all unions are doing is protecting the tiniest bastions of what they can protect of a world where capitalism doesn't literally destroy everything.

403
00:26:10,241 --> 00:26:11,622
Rym: At some point, it all has to give.

404
00:26:11,743 --> 00:26:13,405
Rym: But that's a topic for another day.

405
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:14,746
Rym: This was a huge victory.

406
00:26:15,247 --> 00:26:19,612
Rym: And hopefully this will force the rest of the strike to resolve on good terms.

407
00:26:19,832 --> 00:26:26,100
Rym: This is ammo in the UAW's pocket that maybe they should fight just as hard and go and go just as hard.

408
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:33,626
Rym: And I encourage any of you out there, if you work at a place that's not unionized, sniff around and see if you can unionize.

409
00:26:34,107 --> 00:26:49,760
Rym: Unions are at a height of power right now, because even if the industry wants to go entirely to unscripted content to avoid the consequences of this strike, the one movie that gets made with real writers will be the only good movie that year eventually.

410
00:26:50,963 --> 00:26:59,000
Scott: If you look, there are still, right, this whole 2023 was all what the people went nuts for the Barbenheimer, neither which I saw.

411
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,660
Rym: We're gonna go see Oppenheimer on Friday, I think.

412
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,454
Scott: But they were both written, right?

413
00:27:03,494 --> 00:27:04,140
Scott: Those are written.

414
00:27:07,062 --> 00:27:09,090
Rym: Do you want every show to be "All my balls are

415
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:09,712
Rym: jackass?"?

416
00:27:10,755 --> 00:27:12,040
Rym: And even jackass had a script.

417
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,665
Scott: I mean, I just do.

418
00:27:13,725 --> 00:27:15,960
Scott: I don't really watch TV, period, written or unwritten.

419
00:27:18,024 --> 00:27:21,452
Rym: And in some other news, this is actually breaking news today.

420
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:24,980
Rym: I think the dateline is like a few hours ago.

421
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:38,020
Rym: Basically, New York City passed a law and a bunch of requirements that gig workers doing deliveries had to be paid the same fucking New York minimum wage and couldn't be paid.

422
00:27:38,441 --> 00:27:40,399
Scott: The council passed that law a while ago.

423
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:50,560
Rym: Yep, and there were huge lawsuits and basically Grubhub, Uber and DoorDash fought with terrifying amounts of money to block this.

424
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,299
Scott: Oh, not Instacart wasn't in on that, too?

425
00:27:53,001 --> 00:27:56,935
Rym: Instacart was not listed in the article on CNBC that I'm looking at right now.

426
00:27:56,955 --> 00:27:57,196
Rym: I assume.

427
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,600
Scott: Because as evil as those are, I always feel like Instacart is the worst one.

428
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,128
Rym: Yeah, Instacart probably is the worst one.

429
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:05,200
Rym: Well, Uber might actually be the worst one.

430
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,857
Scott: They're real bad, too.

431
00:28:06,898 --> 00:28:07,080
Scott: Anyway.

432
00:28:07,421 --> 00:28:08,700
Rym: Anyway, they're all bad.

433
00:28:10,786 --> 00:28:13,700
Rym: Granted, I used Grubhub yesterday because they don't have a lot of options.

434
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,422
Scott: Yeah, I used Grubhub.

435
00:28:14,483 --> 00:28:15,747
Scott: I don't use the other ones.

436
00:28:15,807 --> 00:28:19,780
Scott: Grubhub is evil, but just the slightest bit less evil than the other ones.

437
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:33,572
Rym: Although, I got a quote here from this article where a Grubhub spokesperson called the decision disappointing, saying a statement that they're evaluating their next legal actions and basically said, "Well, we're going to change our whole platform now and fuck all of you.

438
00:28:34,013 --> 00:28:34,917
Rym: Everything's going to be worse

439
00:28:34,977 --> 00:28:35,198
Rym: now.".

440
00:28:36,104 --> 00:28:36,759
Scott: Alright, good luck.

441
00:28:37,721 --> 00:28:42,860
Rym: So, I bet what they're going to do is just turn the screws on the restaurants and raise their prices some terrifying amount.

442
00:28:45,301 --> 00:28:51,560
Rym: Anyway, so they all sued like crazy and did huge astroturfing and influence campaigns to try to block this.

443
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,584
Rym: And in the end, they failed.

444
00:28:53,825 --> 00:28:56,292
Rym: The courts were like, "Nope, there is nothing wrong with this law.

445
00:28:56,613 --> 00:28:58,859
Rym: You're all idiots, and this is going to go into

446
00:28:58,899 --> 00:28:59,200
Rym: effect.".

447
00:28:59,661 --> 00:29:00,726
Rym: And that's the end of it.

448
00:29:01,389 --> 00:29:03,899
Rym: Appeal to the Supreme Court if you really want to.

449
00:29:05,601 --> 00:29:08,751
Scott: So yeah, a law like this though, it's like this is what it's all about.

450
00:29:08,771 --> 00:29:11,380
Scott: Where it's like, hey, even if the company is super evil, right?

451
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:21,400
Scott: It's like when the regulations are strong enough that companies really just can't cross a certain line of evil without breaking the law.

452
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,940
Rym: They'll go right up to that line.

453
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,000
Scott: Right.

454
00:29:24,261 --> 00:29:27,188
Scott: Then it's like you sort of, it sort of makes life easier.

455
00:29:27,248 --> 00:29:31,658
Scott: You don't have to like, you know, sort of pick and choose like, "Oh, is it okay for me to use this company?

456
00:29:31,718 --> 00:29:32,079
Scott: They're so

457
00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:32,440
Scott: evil.".

458
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:39,680
Scott: It's like even the evilest company isn't, you know, can only be so much evil and you can sort of not have to worry about that so much.

459
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,179
Rym: I think in the US, unless you're eating.

460
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,975
Scott: Knowing that the person who's delivering your food is getting paid a fair amount, you know, it's like,

461
00:29:46,597 --> 00:29:46,918
Scott: "Alright."

462
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:47,700
Scott: Yep.

463
00:29:48,001 --> 00:30:05,020
Rym: So it's going to rise on a schedule and then it'll hit $19.96 per hour, which is still, from my perspective on capital and human labor, $20 an hour for a real human's difficult effort is insulting and dangerous to society.

464
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:13,460
Scott: So not only, right, so $20 an hour times 40 hours times 52 weeks a year is only $41,000.

465
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:21,920
Scott: And not only, you know, it's like, yeah, $41,000 may be for someone who's doing something that's like super easy and safe and chill.

466
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:31,040
Rym: No, these guys are riding e-bikes that are on the verge of exploding with bootleg batteries, sharing apartments, delivering food in New York City.

467
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:37,660
Scott: In all kinds of weather, right, in all kinds of weather, snow, rain, whatever, it's like carrying shit.

468
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,751
Rym: They're getting hit by cars all the time.

469
00:30:39,973 --> 00:30:41,200
Rym: Their bikes are getting stolen all the time.

470
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:45,749
Scott: All day, at all weird hours, to your stupid ass house, right?

471
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:48,414
Scott: It's like, that's underwater welding levels of danger.

472
00:30:48,454 --> 00:30:51,360
Scott: It should be at least three times that much money.

473
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:51,681
Scott: Yup.

474
00:30:52,543 --> 00:30:59,680
Rym: Now, of course, the common villain in everything we talked about today, except that really nice camera, is capitalism, and just make sure you internalize that.

475
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:08,364
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

476
00:31:08,465 --> 00:31:17,000
Rym: So, back at RIT, I remember, I don't remember if it was a bear or a gorilla, because after Scott mentioned that he thought it was a bear, I think I remember a bear.

477
00:31:17,061 --> 00:31:17,960
Scott: I don't remember either.

478
00:31:18,321 --> 00:31:26,860
Rym: But also, having gone down a deep rabbit hole of the current state of research in human cognition, I learned something about memory.

479
00:31:29,442 --> 00:31:34,820
Rym: So, humans don't actually, we don't remember details very well, except in very certain circumstances.

480
00:31:35,301 --> 00:31:52,340
Rym: And the going theory is that if we try to remember something, especially from a long time ago, our brain will remember specific pieces of information, and then it will go through your other memories to basically fill in all the details with what is the most plausible.

481
00:31:53,020 --> 00:32:04,520
Rym: So, like, you might have a memory of eating at a restaurant when you were a kid, and you'll remember a few specific things, but if you think back and recall it, your brain might insert very vivid components of that memory.

482
00:32:05,042 --> 00:32:08,999
Rym: That are basically compiled from other memories as a best guess.

483
00:32:10,681 --> 00:32:17,795
Scott: Yeah, I'm surprised to hear you admit to this, because very often I say, "Oh, I remember this, but I'm not so

484
00:32:17,855 --> 00:32:18,115
Scott: sure.".

485
00:32:18,215 --> 00:32:19,718
Scott: And you're like, "No, it's definitely...".

486
00:32:21,501 --> 00:32:26,300
Scott: You just guarantee, you're so sure that you're right about things that you remember.

487
00:32:28,501 --> 00:32:36,179
Rym: I am 100% sure that you and I used to run up that right side of that Counter-Strike map all the time, that it was like a thing we would do.

488
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,420
Scott: Well, you didn't remember the rules to match at the gathering.

489
00:32:40,821 --> 00:32:44,179
Rym: Either that, or everyone in my middle school got that one rule wrong, and it didn't matter.

490
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:45,844
Scott: Either one.

491
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:48,380
Scott: You're either wrong then, or you're wrong now, or both.

492
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:48,821
Scott: Yep.

493
00:32:49,322 --> 00:32:50,585
Rym: So anyway, we saw this video.

494
00:32:51,788 --> 00:32:53,372
Rym: You've probably seen a video like this, too.

495
00:32:53,392 --> 00:32:56,620
Rym: A lot of teachers show it in school, where they give you a task.

496
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,346
Rym: Like, "Hey, here's a bunch of kids playing basketball.

497
00:32:58,587 --> 00:32:59,972
Rym: Count how many times the basketball gets

498
00:33:00,032 --> 00:33:00,413
Rym: passed.".

499
00:33:00,694 --> 00:33:02,260
Rym: And you do it, and it feels really easy.

500
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,649
Rym: And then the teacher's like, "So, who saw the

501
00:33:04,689 --> 00:33:05,171
Rym: gorilla?".

502
00:33:05,472 --> 00:33:06,416
Rym: And everyone in the room goes,

503
00:33:06,858 --> 00:33:07,079
Rym: "What?".

504
00:33:07,521 --> 00:33:12,765
Rym: And then they play the video again, and there's clearly a gorilla, like, in the-- Not even hiding.

505
00:33:12,845 --> 00:33:15,037
Scott: Just right fucking there, dancing, waving.

506
00:33:16,342 --> 00:33:21,959
Rym: It's like waving its hands, and when we saw this at RIT, we were like, "There's no

507
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:22,200
Rym: way!".

508
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:27,960
Rym: And we go back and watch the actual, original video, and it's there, and it was kind of an amazing demonstration.

509
00:33:28,993 --> 00:33:29,079
Rym: Yep.

510
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:29,822
Rym: Like, it worked.

511
00:33:30,304 --> 00:33:31,490
Rym: And never thought about it again.

512
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:35,439
Scott: SciShow, eight days ago-- I thought about it maybe a couple times again.

513
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:35,800
Rym: Yeah.

514
00:33:36,242 --> 00:33:42,880
Rym: But SciShow uploaded a video eight days ago, what that famous gorilla suit study didn't see.

515
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:54,100
Rym: And basically, that study, the original study where people made the videos based on it, opened a whole fucking can of worms on human cognition.

516
00:33:54,541 --> 00:34:02,660
Rym: And there have been huge advances and major updates to science based on the continued follow-ups from that study.

517
00:34:03,161 --> 00:34:09,639
Rym: And this video is a summary of all the crazy nonsense we have learned since then about why we don't see the gorilla.

518
00:34:10,062 --> 00:34:15,139
Rym: There's a lot to unpack, and this is an eight minute summary of some really interesting things about humans.

519
00:34:16,722 --> 00:34:17,378
Rym: So what do you got?

520
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,569
Scott: So, since I did a photo news, I'll do a photo thing of the day.

521
00:34:21,629 --> 00:34:25,120
Scott: I found this YouTube channel, because everything in the day is a YouTube channel these days.

522
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:30,540
Scott: There's this guy named Paulie B. How could you not love a guy named Paulie B who's in New York, right?

523
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:34,780
Scott: I don't know that he's from New York, but he's living in New York, at least, as far as I can tell from his YouTube channel.

524
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:46,000
Scott: And there is YouTube, if you haven't searched for photo stuff on YouTube, YouTube has way too much photo stuff, because cameras are how you make YouTube.

525
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:49,679
Scott: So of course, camera people are all over YouTube, right?

526
00:34:51,761 --> 00:34:56,719
Scott: But once YouTube knows you want to watch photo related content, you will be buried.

527
00:34:57,382 --> 00:35:02,720
Scott: Most of that content, as I discussed in the news, is about camera equipment, right?

528
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:12,620
Scott: Camera people discussing camera equipment, not all of its bad content, but like when I said, oh yeah, all the camera review people got Nikon ZF preview models, right?

529
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,854
Scott: And those are the only people who've had them, right?

530
00:35:15,035 --> 00:35:15,780
Scott: Because it's not out yet.

531
00:35:16,441 --> 00:35:23,660
Scott: Go look on YouTube and see how many people have Nikon ZFs in their video that they're holding there.

532
00:35:24,443 --> 00:35:25,840
Scott: It's a lot, right?

533
00:35:26,181 --> 00:35:31,720
Scott: There are so many people who only just like review camera shit on YouTube.

534
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:39,620
Rym: And it's the same thing as you try to look for tech stuff, and it's just people talking about computer equipment and nothing about what to use that equipment for.

535
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,382
Scott: Exactly.

536
00:35:41,582 --> 00:35:51,120
Scott: And Paulie B, right, is the rare example of someone who's actually talking about, you know, it's like he might ask someone once, like hey, what camera you got there?

537
00:35:51,241 --> 00:35:52,740
Scott: And then that's the end of it, right?

538
00:35:53,081 --> 00:35:54,645
Scott: He's not judging them.

539
00:35:54,665 --> 00:35:55,829
Scott: He's not reviewing them.

540
00:35:55,909 --> 00:35:59,700
Scott: It's like they are talking about, you know, the art of taking photos.

541
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:04,208
Scott: Mostly he's doing street photos, but you know, he's interviewing people.

542
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:11,280
Scott: He does a show, Walkie Talkie, where basically one person is a street photographer who's, you know, a professional.

543
00:36:12,082 --> 00:36:15,339
Scott: And they walk around taking photos, and he just walks with them and talks to them.

544
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,019
Rym: That's a real good format right there.

545
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,964
Scott: And shows you what their work looks like.

546
00:36:19,645 --> 00:36:21,669
Scott: And it's like, you know, it's like.

547
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:23,513
Scott: this is the real content.

548
00:36:23,774 --> 00:36:26,720
Scott: if you're, you know, an artist or creative person, right?

549
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:33,140
Scott: Where you're not, it's not about the equipment or the technique so much or the technology.

550
00:36:33,781 --> 00:36:37,091
Scott: It's like it's about the people, you know, the creative people.

551
00:36:37,151 --> 00:36:40,080
Scott: You can learn from them and what they're doing, right?

552
00:36:40,621 --> 00:36:55,320
Scott: And there are not enough YouTube channels like this one, and I wish that the algorithm that, you know, if it was not capitalist, right, and about trying to sell things, it would rank this kind of content higher, right, than, you know, the other kind.

553
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,195
Scott: But it doesn't, so you have to find it from a thing of the day.

554
00:36:58,437 --> 00:36:58,960
Scott: So now you did.

555
00:36:59,881 --> 00:37:11,920
Rym: In the meta moment, the GeekNuts Book Club book, which we will do the show on a week or two after the upcoming Murderbot book comes out, because I am now a third of the way through the fifth Murderbot.

556
00:37:12,921 --> 00:37:14,880
Scott: Let me just check the date on that while you're talking.

557
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:15,281
Rym: Yep.

558
00:37:15,562 --> 00:37:17,767
Rym: But the Murderbot Diaries, that is the book club book.

559
00:37:18,047 --> 00:37:23,280
Rym: We're going to talk about all of the Murderbot Diaries that have been released hitherto when we do the show.

560
00:37:23,961 --> 00:37:35,420
Rym: And if you're a listener of this podcast, I am hard pressed to think of the person who likes GeekNights, but would not at least enjoy some aspect of the Murderbot Diaries.

561
00:37:36,221 --> 00:37:36,482
Scott: All right.

562
00:37:36,502 --> 00:37:36,923
Scott: Here you go.

563
00:37:37,003 --> 00:37:40,489
Scott: Book seven comes out November 14th.

564
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:46,980
Scott: It follows the events in network effect, which is book one, two, five.

565
00:37:47,661 --> 00:37:47,921
Rym: Yep.

566
00:37:49,385 --> 00:37:50,187
Rym: That's the one with.

567
00:37:50,347 --> 00:37:52,112
Rym: that's the one with all the.

568
00:37:52,172 --> 00:37:53,235
Rym: well, anyway, no spoilers.

569
00:37:53,275 --> 00:37:54,759
Rym: I'm reading that one right now.

570
00:37:55,822 --> 00:37:56,022
Scott: Yeah.

571
00:37:56,042 --> 00:38:00,174
Scott: So immediately following book five is books is book seven.

572
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:02,460
Scott: So if you didn't know, the books don't come in chronological order.

573
00:38:04,042 --> 00:38:06,191
Scott: You know, book six doesn't happen.

574
00:38:06,211 --> 00:38:08,360
Scott: You know, whatever you get the idea.

575
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,460
Rym: I'm reading them in publication order because I don't I'm not going to play.

576
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:12,101
Scott: I'm also.

577
00:38:12,121 --> 00:38:23,380
Scott: I also read them in publication order, but I'm just saying chronologically book six happens, I think, before book five and book seven happens immediately after book.

578
00:38:24,661 --> 00:38:24,983
Scott: Five.

579
00:38:25,124 --> 00:38:27,579
Scott: I can't keep track of it.

580
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:38,480
Rym: Anyway, Murderbot Diaries, big alien, aliens, world type vibes, but possibly before it gets as dystopian as that world, but not that much before possibly.

581
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:39,963
Rym: Anyway, they're good books.

582
00:38:40,083 --> 00:38:40,645
Rym: I'm enjoying them.

583
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:41,988
Rym: Definitely can do a show on.

584
00:38:42,549 --> 00:38:47,120
Scott: the Iliad translated by Emily Wilson is now available.

585
00:38:48,241 --> 00:38:52,940
Scott: I'm in, I think, 16th place in the queue at the library to get a copy.

586
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:58,180
Scott: I just agree right now after we do the murder about how many copies they have.

587
00:38:58,321 --> 00:39:01,219
Scott: But if they only have one, that means I can have to wait over a year.

588
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:11,099
Rym: So let's agree that after the murder about show at whenever we both have a copy of the Iliad to read, I'm just going to probably cancel my library reserve and buy it for 20 bucks.

589
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:16,074
Rym: But once we do that, we're going to pause the book club to do a book club episode on that.

590
00:39:16,154 --> 00:39:18,180
Rym: It doesn't count as your choice or my choice.

591
00:39:18,803 --> 00:39:19,511
Scott: Oh, you want to do that?

592
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,159
Scott: I figured we could.

593
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:26,580
Rym: Anyway, there's no universe where I don't read that book basically as fast as possible once I sit down with a copy of it.

594
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,369
Scott: I think it's going to be a lot.

595
00:39:27,389 --> 00:39:28,179
Scott: I think it's long, though.

596
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:31,933
Rym: I feel like I can read it pretty quick.

597
00:39:31,973 --> 00:39:33,398
Rym: I read that Odyssey pretty quick.

598
00:39:35,087 --> 00:39:35,700
Scott: Like a lamnod.

599
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:44,920
Rym: Well, that's going to be the stinger at the end of the show, because that's looping in my head right now, including the video that I remember in more detail than I should.

600
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,920
Rym: The little googly eyes of the lamb shop.

601
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:47,919
Scott: I remember that video perfectly.

602
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,926
Rym: Because I remember watching that video.

603
00:39:49,946 --> 00:39:51,854
Rym: All I could think the whole time is, is that Ra?

604
00:39:52,135 --> 00:39:53,180
Rym: I hope he washed his hands.

605
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:54,381
Scott: Yeah.

606
00:39:54,401 --> 00:40:04,280
Scott: So the final meta moment is that maybe next weekend, the seventh and eighth, we can attempt to launch the Geek Knights website, maybe?

607
00:40:04,381 --> 00:40:05,579
Rym: Exciting times.

608
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:06,716
Scott: We'll see.

609
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:11,640
Rym: Say goodbye to the Web 2.0 version of the Geek Knights website.

610
00:40:12,628 --> 00:40:13,140
Scott: Yeah, whatever.

611
00:40:14,521 --> 00:40:15,123
Rym: We're going back.

612
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:16,829
Rym: Actually, I'd say the new website.

613
00:40:16,849 --> 00:40:19,900
Rym: We're going back to a Web 1.0 type of experience on purpose.

614
00:40:20,622 --> 00:40:25,440
Scott: I mean, it doesn't look like a GeoCities website, but it's like it's pretty much just HTML, CSS.

615
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:26,242
Scott: We got rid of.

616
00:40:26,262 --> 00:40:30,254
Scott: I think there's maybe one JavaScript that's small.

617
00:40:30,335 --> 00:40:32,100
Scott: And if you turn off JavaScript, you won't even notice.

618
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,499
Rym: We're going back to the intent of the World Wide Web.

619
00:40:35,322 --> 00:40:35,706
Scott: Yeah.

620
00:40:35,909 --> 00:40:36,778
Scott: So, you know.

621
00:40:38,161 --> 00:40:38,462
Rym: All right.

622
00:40:38,482 --> 00:40:39,284
Rym: Let's get right into it.

623
00:40:39,364 --> 00:40:45,800
Rym: Partly because we've gone a little long, which happens when we do shows in weird order, skip episodes recently.

624
00:40:47,141 --> 00:40:50,040
Rym: Anyway, we went to a concert and...

625
00:40:51,765 --> 00:40:54,420
Scott: So I knew the concert was coming and bought tickets way in advance.

626
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:54,690
Scott: Yep.

627
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:55,662
Scott: Right.

628
00:40:56,247 --> 00:40:58,060
Scott: And like the day they went on sale, basically.

629
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:02,513
Rym: And when you did that, at the time, I had a tentative work trip where there was a chance.

630
00:41:02,533 --> 00:41:04,840
Rym: I was going to be in like Asia for three weeks.

631
00:41:05,661 --> 00:41:06,244
Rym: So there was.

632
00:41:06,546 --> 00:41:08,658
Rym: I wasn't sure if I could go and there's a good chance I couldn't.

633
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:16,000
Rym: So I just filed it away as I'll get tickets if it's not sold out when I know if I have to go on this work trip.

634
00:41:16,061 --> 00:41:17,279
Rym: And then I just immediately forgot.

635
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:23,700
Scott: So the day before the concert, I just go and I look and I'm like, oh, why is this show not sold out?

636
00:41:23,901 --> 00:41:27,200
Scott: And I'm like, I'm just like, hey, anyone, you know, I'm going to the show tomorrow.

637
00:41:27,348 --> 00:41:27,539
Rym: Yeah.

638
00:41:27,881 --> 00:41:30,419
Scott: It's not sold out if anyone else wants to go.

639
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,320
Scott: You know, hey.

640
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:32,800
Rym: Yeah.

641
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,440
Rym: So our friend Kat went with with another friend, Carl.

642
00:41:36,281 --> 00:41:38,912
Rym: And I was while we were doing GeekNights because I was.

643
00:41:38,972 --> 00:41:40,980
Rym: I was thinking about this while wrapping up the show.

644
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:46,480
Rym: You might have seen me get a little distracted because I go and I start poking around a ticket master like, let's see what kind of tickets I can get.

645
00:41:46,961 --> 00:41:51,140
Rym: And I see a scattered seats in the upper mezzanines that aren't sold.

646
00:41:51,761 --> 00:41:56,980
Rym: And I see four seats in the orchestra pit right fucking next to the stage that are not sold.

647
00:41:57,326 --> 00:41:58,059
Rym: So I click on this.

648
00:41:58,301 --> 00:42:01,709
Scott: What is I think I never even clicked on those because like I just like.

649
00:42:01,829 --> 00:42:04,817
Scott: I don't because like I would never click on those first five hundred dollars.

650
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:08,559
Rym: I clicked on the cheap seats and they were like 80 bucks.

651
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,200
Rym: And then I thought for a second.

652
00:42:10,681 --> 00:42:11,980
Rym: So I thought, OK, I can get some tickets.

653
00:42:12,401 --> 00:42:14,740
Rym: And then I thought, how much would it be to get the crazy ticket?

654
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,399
Rym: I'm expecting to see some stupid number.

655
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:21,980
Rym: So I click on the mezzanine and it says one hundred and eighty bucks, which one hundred dollars is a lot more.

656
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:29,780
Rym: But that is like upgrading from shit coach to regular coach is more than that on an airline for one flight.

657
00:42:30,561 --> 00:42:34,869
Scott: Yeah, it's like hockey games are well, that's like the price of like.

658
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:40,160
Scott: the best hockey game is one hundred eighty bucks and the non playoff, at least at the Madison Square Garden.

659
00:42:40,822 --> 00:42:43,020
Scott: So if you go somewhere else, that'll be several hockey.

660
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:52,200
Rym: So if you watch the nice episode a few nights ago, you will see me like ignore Scott for like 90 seconds while I frantically buy two of those tickets before they disappear because that's.

661
00:42:52,480 --> 00:43:04,400
Scott: Yeah, it's like I paid like, you know, one hundred and just change right to get like pretty close to the front of the first mezzanine because it's maybe 14 feet away from us and came right.

662
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:07,639
Rym: Or like came down next to us to shake hands with a bunch of people.

663
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:13,980
Scott: It's like if I would have known, it's like I just didn't look closely because it's just, you know, I just like, oh, buy the reasonable ticket.

664
00:43:14,402 --> 00:43:16,436
Scott: I'll just click on a reasonable area, buy a ticket.

665
00:43:16,476 --> 00:43:16,980
Scott: Who cares?

666
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:18,726
Scott: I didn't even think to explore.

667
00:43:18,786 --> 00:43:22,260
Scott: But of course, when I after you said you got the close up seats, I'm like, what the fuck?

668
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:25,752
Scott: And I look at the price range was just eighty to one eighty.

669
00:43:25,813 --> 00:43:27,880
Scott: I'm like, that is a fucking narrow range.

670
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:28,681
Rym: Right.

671
00:43:28,721 --> 00:43:34,940
Scott: Radio City Music Hall, usually out you expect a range of like forty to five hundred dollars to five hundred dollars.

672
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:45,416
Rym: Two times in my life I have had tickets with seats in what I would consider the extremely good, like ridiculous.

673
00:43:45,436 --> 00:43:47,900
Rym: you would never sit here normally plays three times.

674
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:53,000
Rym: Once we sat front row at a playoff Red Wings game when I was a kid because my dad got some tickets.

675
00:43:53,901 --> 00:44:03,140
Rym: Once we were in the I think second row or third row when Patrick Stewart's Macbeth, like that crazy one, like we saw that we that was a lot of money, but we saw that.

676
00:44:03,481 --> 00:44:04,805
Rym: And third was this concert.

677
00:44:04,825 --> 00:44:09,079
Scott: I mean, I've been in luxury boxes, I guess that didn't pay for it.

678
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,580
Scott: That's not front row, but that's the same level of, you know.

679
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,660
Rym: Yeah, but I guess even then I you know, it was a concert.

680
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:21,740
Rym: So I expected like I expected these seats to be great, but I also didn't expect it to be like that much different sitting somewhere else.

681
00:44:22,321 --> 00:44:26,600
Scott: But having actually been up in the mezzanine, it was perfectly fantastic.

682
00:44:27,841 --> 00:44:34,520
Rym: But like it was it was an experience to sit that close and see every little detail of all those dancers and all that nonsense on stage.

683
00:44:35,321 --> 00:44:42,220
Rym: Also, the thing I learned about that orchestra pit that I'll talk about at the end because it's not relevant to the concert was kind of amazing.

684
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:47,400
Scott: So I mean, Janelle Monae is someone I've been a fan of since like at least since I lived in Beacon.

685
00:44:48,441 --> 00:44:52,052
Scott: But hasn't released, you know, albums that frequently.

686
00:44:52,112 --> 00:44:54,940
Scott: There was like a big gap of like I want to say it a few years.

687
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:56,647
Rym: Like Dirty Computer was like what?

688
00:44:56,647 --> 00:44:56,707
Rym: 2017, 2018.

689
00:44:56,707 --> 00:44:58,575
Rym: Like it was a while.

690
00:44:58,635 --> 00:44:59,740
Rym: It was pre-Covid.

691
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:00,669
Scott: Something like that.

692
00:45:00,689 --> 00:45:01,360
Scott: I don't remember the exact year.

693
00:45:01,623 --> 00:45:02,312
Rym: There it is.

694
00:45:02,312 --> 00:45:02,920
Rym: 2018, Dirty Computer.

695
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:04,040
Scott: Right.

696
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:06,289
Scott: And so then, you know, Age of Pleasure was this year.

697
00:45:06,309 --> 00:45:09,200
Scott: So it's a five year, four or five year gap between albums.

698
00:45:10,182 --> 00:45:10,503
Scott: Right.

699
00:45:10,884 --> 00:45:14,958
Scott: You know, but she was doing other things like acting and, you know, still, you know, business.

700
00:45:15,219 --> 00:45:15,420
Scott: Right.

701
00:45:16,561 --> 00:45:19,557
Scott: And it's like it's one of those people where it's like, I'm a fan of them.

702
00:45:19,979 --> 00:45:20,160
Scott: Right.

703
00:45:20,441 --> 00:45:22,807
Scott: They're crazy awesome and talented.

704
00:45:22,907 --> 00:45:27,740
Scott: And, you know, I like everything about them, but I'm not like, you know, focused on them.

705
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:28,381
Scott: Right.

706
00:45:28,421 --> 00:45:31,590
Scott: I'm not like number one fan obsessed with them.

707
00:45:31,831 --> 00:45:32,051
Scott: Right.

708
00:45:32,092 --> 00:45:34,980
Scott: The way like people are obsessed with Taylor Swift.

709
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:36,203
Scott: I don't think I'm like that.

710
00:45:36,403 --> 00:45:36,744
Scott: Yes.

711
00:45:36,985 --> 00:45:38,350
Scott: Or the Beatles or.

712
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:41,560
Rym: I don't think I'm like that with literally anything or anyone.

713
00:45:43,041 --> 00:45:43,642
Scott: I guess not.

714
00:45:44,383 --> 00:45:52,500
Scott: But it's just like one of the artists that I greatly enjoy and I recognize as a unique and amazing, talented person.

715
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:55,170
Scott: And it's like, oh, why wouldn't I go see them?

716
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:55,652
Scott: Look at that.

717
00:45:55,832 --> 00:45:57,800
Rym: Especially because we both kind of broke the seal.

718
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:01,900
Scott: Especially if I'm not going to get another chance, if you don't release another album and go on tour again for five years.

719
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:05,815
Rym: Plus, after three years of isolation and starting to come back out of that.

720
00:46:05,935 --> 00:46:06,960
Scott: I think we'll get more chances.

721
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:12,740
Rym: She's not old, but I think we both started prioritizing experiences like that.

722
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:15,590
Rym: Like that is the most important thing is to experience things.

723
00:46:16,152 --> 00:46:18,460
Rym: And we both started going to a bunch of concerts recently.

724
00:46:19,001 --> 00:46:20,646
Rym: And yeah, live music is just amazing.

725
00:46:20,706 --> 00:46:25,320
Rym: Like go to concerts, go see live music, even if it's like low tier local stuff.

726
00:46:26,601 --> 00:46:27,826
Scott: Yeah, but you know, so it's like.

727
00:46:28,689 --> 00:46:31,420
Scott: but the question is, I'm like, why didn't this sell out?

728
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,385
Scott: Like she is insanely popular.

729
00:46:33,586 --> 00:46:35,972
Rym: And it was a crazy good show.

730
00:46:36,534 --> 00:46:36,775
Scott: Right.

731
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:38,720
Scott: I'm like, why is this not sold out?

732
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:47,340
Scott: And the only thing that I can think is like, the only explanation is either A, she's less popular than I thought, which doesn't make a lot of sense.

733
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,782
Rym: I don't think so.

734
00:46:48,822 --> 00:46:51,688
Scott: It's like everyone I know knows who that is.

735
00:46:52,189 --> 00:46:58,320
Scott: Or B, is it that a lot of people have the same attitude that I have?

736
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:07,420
Scott: Where it's like, yeah, you know, they're not like so focused on her that they're like number one fans, like noticing that she's on tour following her.

737
00:47:07,961 --> 00:47:09,788
Scott: Or there's a third theory.

738
00:47:09,808 --> 00:47:10,811
Rym: I have two.

739
00:47:10,852 --> 00:47:12,156
Rym: There's a fourth theory, possibly, too.

740
00:47:12,196 --> 00:47:13,080
Rym: Let's see what your third one is.

741
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:18,060
Scott: My third theory is that she's also got a stop in Brooklyn, which divided up the New York crowd.

742
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:24,560
Rym: Oh yeah, the girl who was sitting with us in the pit wanted to go see her in Brooklyn and it was sold out and got Radio City instead.

743
00:47:25,643 --> 00:47:31,660
Rym: So the people we hung out with in the pit also bought those tickets right before for nothing.

744
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:34,207
Rym: And they were also like, I can't believe we got these seats.

745
00:47:34,508 --> 00:47:38,120
Rym: But she was like a superfan and she was losing her shit.

746
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,007
Scott: So there are people who are superfans.

747
00:47:40,027 --> 00:47:41,995
Rym: But she got the ticket for 180 bucks.

748
00:47:42,878 --> 00:47:43,420
Scott: I know, right?

749
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:48,560
Rym: Only because Brooklyn was sold out and she, like the day before, the same day after the ticket.

750
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:52,554
Scott: I guess people feel like the Brooklyn show is gonna be better, but actually I'd rather go.

751
00:47:52,594 --> 00:47:54,260
Scott: Radio City is, you know, it's big.

752
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,789
Scott: People don't know, Radio City Music Hall is indoors.

753
00:47:57,849 --> 00:47:58,651
Scott: It's not an arena.

754
00:47:59,113 --> 00:48:00,336
Scott: But it is big.

755
00:48:00,396 --> 00:48:01,720
Scott: It has a lot of seats.

756
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:05,814
Scott: It is bigger than the Opera House at Met, I'm pretty sure.

757
00:48:05,834 --> 00:48:07,400
Scott: At least it feels bigger.

758
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:15,340
Rym: According to Wikipedia, Radio City's four-tiered auditorium was the world's largest auditorium when it was opened.

759
00:48:16,163 --> 00:48:17,669
Scott: Yeah, it's an auditorium, right?

760
00:48:17,689 --> 00:48:20,620
Scott: But it's, you know, whereas the Brooklyn show is a Barclays, right?

761
00:48:21,162 --> 00:48:21,846
Rym: I don't know.

762
00:48:21,866 --> 00:48:23,920
Rym: I assume so, but I don't actually know.

763
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:25,403
Scott: But that's an arena, right?

764
00:48:25,463 --> 00:48:32,137
Scott: I would much rather go to even a very large auditorium than even a small arena, right?

765
00:48:32,197 --> 00:48:33,800
Scott: For a musical performance.

766
00:48:34,421 --> 00:48:36,893
Rym: Also, Radio City's capacity is like 6,000 people.

767
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:39,280
Scott: Yeah, it's big.

768
00:48:39,681 --> 00:48:40,957
Rym: And it's 90 years old.

769
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:45,340
Scott: You really feel far away, even if you're far away, because of the shape of the place.

770
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:50,120
Rym: Yeah, and it was revolutionary in a bunch of ways that would be a distraction from the rest of the show.

771
00:48:50,420 --> 00:49:03,420
Rym: But while we were there, because of the weird thing I learned about the orchestra pit after looking down that crack and then looking at Wikipedia and then reading a bunch of stuff, Radio City was like one of the most advanced auditoriums in the world when it was built.

772
00:49:04,521 --> 00:49:06,040
Scott: You used to be able to watch movies there.

773
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:10,100
Rym: Yeah, it is still one of the best designed auditoriums in the world today.

774
00:49:11,241 --> 00:49:16,474
Scott: I mean, who's making a new big auditorium today to compete with it, right?

775
00:49:16,494 --> 00:49:19,040
Scott: You could beat it easily with modern technology, but who is?

776
00:49:20,641 --> 00:49:26,915
Scott: Anyway, so go to the show and obviously my expectation for the show is high, right?

777
00:49:27,015 --> 00:49:29,360
Scott: Because of the talent of the person.

778
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:33,072
Scott: And I have basically zero doubt of being disappointed.

779
00:49:33,153 --> 00:49:35,400
Scott: Like, none whatsoever, right?

780
00:49:36,942 --> 00:49:39,391
Scott: You know, I know that basically it's like it's going to be lit.

781
00:49:39,974 --> 00:49:41,359
Scott: I know that's what it's going to be, right?

782
00:49:42,541 --> 00:49:47,372
Scott: And yet the rare the rarest thing that could possibly happen is me.

783
00:49:47,392 --> 00:49:50,800
Scott: I almost never set a high expectation, right?

784
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:53,606
Scott: I always almost always set a low expectation.

785
00:49:53,626 --> 00:49:57,656
Scott: I set a high one because I was so confident, right?

786
00:49:58,257 --> 00:49:59,480
Scott: And yet it was exceeded.

787
00:49:59,681 --> 00:50:02,880
Rym: It was one of the best musical acts I've ever seen in person in my life.

788
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:13,260
Rym: Now, granted, I haven't been to a huge number of concerts, let alone like the top tier ones, but it was a fucking show and there's so much going on in this show.

789
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:25,440
Rym: The fact like it was the staging almost evoked like the history of music in terms of old reviews and the way the stage was set up with the staircase down the middle.

790
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:26,684
Rym: It was super classy.

791
00:50:27,026 --> 00:50:31,080
Rym: It crossed a variety of different genres, which the album does too.

792
00:50:31,541 --> 00:50:33,184
Rym: The stage setting was fantastic.

793
00:50:33,385 --> 00:50:35,329
Scott: The stage set was like this big amp.

794
00:50:35,389 --> 00:50:40,020
Scott: It was like an amphitheater, but it was facing at us and we're in an auditorium facing at them.

795
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:42,507
Scott: So it's like the performers, are they there?

796
00:50:43,008 --> 00:50:47,340
Scott: They're there to see us right now as much as we are there to see them.

797
00:50:47,821 --> 00:50:48,041
Scott: Right.

798
00:50:48,262 --> 00:50:51,691
Scott: There's just all these layers of meaning going on.

799
00:50:51,971 --> 00:50:55,340
Scott: And it's like, you know, in terms of the types of performances, right?

800
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:59,052
Scott: It's like several, you know, so many genres were crossed.

801
00:50:59,373 --> 00:51:01,460
Scott: You know, she raps, she's singing.

802
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:03,086
Scott: We got the jazzy ones.

803
00:51:03,106 --> 00:51:05,477
Rym: We got some old school R&B style songs.

804
00:51:05,537 --> 00:51:06,140
Rym: We've got some.

805
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,126
Scott: You got the sexy ones.

806
00:51:08,286 --> 00:51:09,270
Scott: You got the chill one.

807
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:11,978
Scott: It's like every single kind of everything is going on there.

808
00:51:12,219 --> 00:51:12,400
Scott: Right.

809
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:15,208
Scott: Different types of dancing, different genres of dancing.

810
00:51:15,248 --> 00:51:16,572
Scott: I knew there'd be a live band.

811
00:51:16,913 --> 00:51:17,194
Scott: Right.

812
00:51:17,394 --> 00:51:19,200
Scott: They come with a live horn section in there.

813
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:22,587
Scott: I didn't know that was going to be in there.

814
00:51:22,687 --> 00:51:29,160
Rym: This was two saxophones, a trumpet, a trombone, and the trumpet was actually a trumpet.

815
00:51:29,802 --> 00:51:32,540
Scott: I thought it was a trombone, a trumpet, and a sax.

816
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:35,170
Rym: So when I said trumpet, that's what I was about to get to.

817
00:51:35,572 --> 00:51:37,620
Rym: That was not actually a regular trumpet.

818
00:51:38,721 --> 00:51:44,152
Rym: That was either a flugelhorn or a flugelhorn adjacent device.

819
00:51:44,612 --> 00:51:48,360
Rym: There's a bunch of things that are like trumpets that are not actually trumpets.

820
00:51:48,922 --> 00:51:51,890
Rym: I really like playing flugelhorns and horns like them.

821
00:51:52,312 --> 00:51:53,616
Rym: They have a very different timbre.

822
00:51:53,696 --> 00:51:55,020
Rym: They feel very different to play.

823
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,845
Rym: They're a different kind of instrument.

824
00:51:58,069 --> 00:52:01,960
Rym: They're a more sophisticated instrument, shall we say, than a trumpet.

825
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:03,343
Rym: They're more like a cornet.

826
00:52:05,068 --> 00:52:09,300
Rym: They were also very good at their music, those players.

827
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,706
Scott: I could say this.

828
00:52:11,726 --> 00:52:17,780
Scott: A lot of people joke that you go to a metal show or a rock show and you can't really hear the bass guitar.

829
00:52:20,901 --> 00:52:32,720
Scott: I think the bass guitar at this show, also because of the disco soul influence in a lot of the music, I heard it more than I heard it at any show in my life.

830
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:36,999
Scott: And the person who was playing the bass was Sick AF.

831
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:52,740
Rym: The sound mixing, and I think part of this was that it was Radio City, was phenomenal in that if you focused on any instrument on stage, you could hear it perfectly clearly at any point.

832
00:52:54,261 --> 00:53:03,100
Scott: There were some sounds that were just recordings, but I don't know if they were coming from literally just a track playing, or just the keyboard was doing it.

833
00:53:03,828 --> 00:53:04,380
Rym: Well that keyboard!

834
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:06,971
Scott: It wasn't like 100% live, it was like 90% live.

835
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:13,660
Rym: That keyboardist up there in that dress, she had a rack of like 8 keyboards that she was playing simultaneously.

836
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:16,880
Scott: Well, you're playing such a wide variety of music, you're not getting it done with one.

837
00:53:19,123 --> 00:53:30,500
Rym: But also the choreography stood out as being both extremely tight and well choreographed, but also very loose and fluid and improvisational on purpose.

838
00:53:30,801 --> 00:53:37,560
Rym: And that stood out compared to how a lot of backup dancers work in this typical kind of choreographed stage show.

839
00:53:38,522 --> 00:53:47,800
Scott: It wasn't like a K-Pop show where it was like everyone was in perfect sync all the time, but it also wasn't like a mess of people just doing whatever.

840
00:53:48,040 --> 00:54:01,020
Scott: It's like they were doing the same dance together, they wouldn't win an award at the Olympics for synchronized swimming, but they all had the feel and emotion in their dancing was stronger.

841
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:16,800
Rym: Well the performance I think was better for it, because if the theme of Age of Pleasure was around safe spaces to explore the unlimited resource of shared pleasure that humans have, which is kind of the theme of the album, you know, the album's really worth a listen.

842
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:23,020
Rym: And if the concert was exploring that theme, everybody on stage looked like they were having a fun time.

843
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:26,140
Scott: Yeah, I think everyone in the crowd is having a fun time.

844
00:54:26,661 --> 00:54:41,000
Scott: The other thing I really appreciated is that I think Led Zeppelin is a good example of a band which intentionally, I think they've said as much, when they perform live, they wanted to sound like the album.

845
00:54:42,321 --> 00:54:43,504
Scott: Only live, obviously.

846
00:54:43,925 --> 00:54:49,579
Scott: They wanted to basically play what it is that you heard at home the way you heard it at home.

847
00:54:51,041 --> 00:54:53,725
Scott: And I guess that's a certain kind of philosophy, right?

848
00:54:53,765 --> 00:54:54,867
Scott: It's like, whatever.

849
00:54:55,288 --> 00:55:02,260
Scott: My philosophy is that if I'm going to a live show on purpose, it's like I can listen to the album at home.

850
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:05,286
Scott: And it's like, yes, those are familiar songs.

851
00:55:05,326 --> 00:55:11,120
Scott: There's pleasure in hearing and enjoying the familiar songs.

852
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:18,875
Scott: Anytime a band tries to play their new song that no one knows, the crowd is not as excited as when you play the hit song.

853
00:55:18,935 --> 00:55:21,100
Scott: That's true for every musician ever.

854
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:26,167
Scott: So it's like, yes, play your hit songs.

855
00:55:26,608 --> 00:55:32,900
Scott: But if it sounds exactly like the album, me, I feel like, why am I here?

856
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:41,229
Scott: I love to hear a different rendition, a different take, a different ad-lib, a different solo at least.

857
00:55:41,269 --> 00:55:45,855
Scott: Do something to mix it up in some way, shape, or form.

858
00:55:46,316 --> 00:55:49,620
Scott: that's not the same as just the album.

859
00:55:50,181 --> 00:55:51,843
Scott: And that's exactly what we got.

860
00:55:51,943 --> 00:55:54,326
Scott: Pretty much every single fucking song.

861
00:55:55,007 --> 00:55:57,070
Scott: You could tell it was the song.

862
00:55:57,371 --> 00:56:00,235
Scott: The structure was usually intact.

863
00:56:00,455 --> 00:56:04,020
Scott: The same verse, chorus pattern, the same lyrics, mostly.

864
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:05,943
Scott: It was the same fucking songs.

865
00:56:06,664 --> 00:56:12,875
Scott: Every single different song up there was a different rendition, a different mix, a different something.

866
00:56:13,637 --> 00:56:15,380
Scott: Sometimes a different genre entirely.

867
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:17,723
Scott: But the same song.

868
00:56:17,823 --> 00:56:18,464
Scott: You knew the song.

869
00:56:18,504 --> 00:56:18,965
Scott: That was it.

870
00:56:19,186 --> 00:56:21,590
Scott: It was from her album, but it doesn't sound like the album.

871
00:56:22,292 --> 00:56:25,899
Scott: So you're paying and getting something for your money.

872
00:56:27,321 --> 00:56:32,194
Scott: Not something that you could have stayed home and listened to on Spotify.

873
00:56:32,335 --> 00:56:34,180
Scott: Unless they release, I guess, a DVD.

874
00:56:34,701 --> 00:56:43,876
Rym: Yeah, but I wouldn't want to just listen to that rendition by itself because it was the whole experience of the whole show together and being in the middle of it.

875
00:56:44,437 --> 00:56:46,140
Rym: Like if I listened to the album, I'd want to listen to the album.

876
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:46,941
Scott: Right.

877
00:56:46,981 --> 00:56:56,774
Scott: There are a lot of shows, I'd say, where you might even be better off just watching a video of the concert on a good stereo, obviously, and not going.

878
00:56:57,255 --> 00:57:00,940
Scott: This one was one of those ones where, nope, being there was not the same.

879
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:03,727
Rym: Especially being in the pit because it was just a dance party.

880
00:57:03,827 --> 00:57:04,670
Rym: Everyone was just dancing.

881
00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:07,196
Scott: Everyone was dancing in the mezzanine too.

882
00:57:07,357 --> 00:57:08,700
Scott: Mezzanine was also a dance party.

883
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:12,544
Rym: Well, there was a moment when they turned on all the lights to do the thing.

884
00:57:12,564 --> 00:57:20,051
Rym: I turned around and it almost was shocking to remember that there's a whole fucking auditorium behind us.

885
00:57:20,151 --> 00:57:24,536
Rym: I was actually kind of lost in the concert, which we're old and jaded and have seen a lot of things.

886
00:57:24,836 --> 00:57:28,760
Rym: It is very rare that I get lost in a performance of something to that degree.

887
00:57:29,561 --> 00:57:34,447
Scott: I could see all the people because I was in the mezzanine.

888
00:57:35,148 --> 00:57:40,996
Scott: Usually when there's chairs, just the presence of chairs, even though people can stand up.

889
00:57:41,797 --> 00:57:42,658
Scott: First of all, we're old.

890
00:57:42,738 --> 00:57:43,900
Scott: I did sit down sometimes.

891
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:51,172
Rym: I sat down for a moment because the last time I stood for an entire concert was Perovselor and I was leaning on a balcony the whole time.

892
00:57:51,192 --> 00:57:53,395
Scott: There were some breaks to sit down.

893
00:57:53,676 --> 00:57:56,320
Scott: She changed clothes way more times than I thought she would.

894
00:57:56,860 --> 00:58:03,350
Rym: That was share level of professional costume change nonsense, which I am always here for.

895
00:58:04,892 --> 00:58:07,856
Scott: Awesome costumes too.

896
00:58:07,916 --> 00:58:08,397
Scott: Big hats.

897
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:10,360
Scott: We love a big hat.

898
00:58:12,041 --> 00:58:20,131
Scott: Despite the presence of chairs, which are the greatest hindrance to people standing up and getting excited, that didn't fucking stop anyone.

899
00:58:20,291 --> 00:58:23,275
Scott: Maybe that is why people are going to the Barclay show.

900
00:58:23,335 --> 00:58:27,200
Scott: I imagine in the arena they'll be just standing GA in front.

901
00:58:28,843 --> 00:58:34,674
Rym: I also imagine that Radio City can't just remove those chairs.

902
00:58:34,694 --> 00:58:36,297
Scott: You can't remove the chairs at Radio City.

903
00:58:36,357 --> 00:58:37,318
Scott: Everything there is chairs.

904
00:58:37,379 --> 00:58:38,100
Scott: It's an auditorium.

905
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:41,523
Rym: One last thing that was noteworthy in this.

906
00:58:41,603 --> 00:58:46,168
Rym: We've got to talk about encores and the history of encores.

907
00:58:46,769 --> 00:58:52,054
Rym: In the oldest times, the encore was a surprise and it wasn't expected.

908
00:58:52,775 --> 00:58:56,619
Rym: An encore would be a surprise and people would be like, "Oh fuck, the band is going to play another

909
00:58:56,659 --> 00:58:56,920
Rym: song.".

910
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:05,150
Rym: But then it became almost a ritual where everyone knows the encore is coming and the band will pretend to leave the stage and then they'll come back.

911
00:59:05,190 --> 00:59:06,352
Rym: And that happened in this concert.

912
00:59:07,013 --> 00:59:11,939
Rym: But then, after that first false encore...

913
00:59:13,101 --> 00:59:14,083
Scott: So there was an encore.

914
00:59:14,383 --> 00:59:19,831
Scott: The usual shtick where they act like the show is over, then they come back out.

915
00:59:19,851 --> 00:59:23,076
Scott: I've basically gotten to the point of so many shows...

916
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Rym: Until the house lights come on, the concert is still going.

917
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:28,681
Scott: Exactly.

918
00:59:28,721 --> 00:59:34,649
Scott: The house lights... First of all, I know just because we always think about meta stuff, because that's how we think.

919
00:59:34,809 --> 00:59:42,679
Scott: The way deals work at venues is the contracts almost always say 11 o'clock, you're done.

920
00:59:42,739 --> 00:59:43,000
Scott: That's it.

921
00:59:43,621 --> 00:59:48,588
Scott: We've got people working here at the concessions and the merch booth and the janitors.

922
00:59:48,829 --> 00:59:51,913
Scott: You've got to be done at 11 in your contract.

923
00:59:51,973 --> 00:59:53,676
Scott: You can't go past 11.

924
00:59:53,676 --> 00:59:55,659
Scott: Almost always, that's the time in the US.

925
00:59:57,721 --> 01:00:01,265
Scott: So I'm looking at the clock, it's like 1059.

926
01:00:01,265 --> 01:00:05,531
Scott: And after that encore, the confetti guns go off.

927
01:00:05,951 --> 01:00:08,014
Scott: And the house lights start to turn on.

928
01:00:08,795 --> 01:00:11,759
Scott: And they start playing recorded music.

929
01:00:12,841 --> 01:00:18,238
Rym: This is the first time in my entire life I got tricked and didn't expect an encore.

930
01:00:18,258 --> 01:00:18,458
Rym: That is...

931
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:27,191
Scott: Before and after a concert, they're always just playing recorded music that someone picked out for whatever method.

932
01:00:27,592 --> 01:00:30,696
Scott: The recorded music comes on, which is the go home music.

933
01:00:31,397 --> 01:00:33,320
Scott: The house lights are on partially.

934
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:36,957
Rym: I stood up and put my hoodie on and took my earplugs out.

935
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:40,440
Scott: Both feet were in the aisle and my back was towards the stage.

936
01:00:40,801 --> 01:00:43,410
Rym: I had literally, I had taken my second earplug out.

937
01:00:43,450 --> 01:00:46,200
Scott: Some other people had already gone into the lobby.

938
01:00:46,620 --> 01:00:51,132
Rym: Now, what then transpired was the best encore I've ever seen in my life.

939
01:00:51,192 --> 01:00:52,836
Rym: It went harder than you can imagine.

940
01:00:52,896 --> 01:00:54,440
Rym: It's hard to describe, but...

941
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:55,041
Scott: I'm pretty sure.

942
01:00:55,162 --> 01:00:57,487
Scott: when she came out, she said something like, "Fuck my

943
01:00:57,527 --> 01:00:58,750
Scott: contract.".

944
01:00:59,512 --> 01:01:02,680
Scott: I'm pretty sure she got in trouble or had to pay a fine or something.

945
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:07,228
Rym: But it went harder than... I find a video of it or something.

946
01:01:07,388 --> 01:01:12,357
Rym: It was quite an encore and I just left my etymotics out for that.

947
01:01:12,777 --> 01:01:14,320
Rym: I just let my ears accept it.

948
01:01:14,601 --> 01:01:16,239
Scott: Earplugs were necessary at the show.

949
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:17,683
Rym: I took my earplugs out.

950
01:01:17,803 --> 01:01:20,408
Rym: I left them out when the second encore started.

951
01:01:21,230 --> 01:01:25,839
Rym: And then I didn't regret that and I'll accept whatever minor damage I took from that final...

952
01:01:26,580 --> 01:01:28,869
Scott: I probably took more damage watching R.R.

953
01:01:28,949 --> 01:01:31,680
Scott: in the theater with no earplugs to hold for three hours.

954
01:01:31,841 --> 01:01:35,816
Rym: I gotta go back to my old rule of, "I always bring my etymotics with me everywhere, just in

955
01:01:35,837 --> 01:01:36,057
Rym: case.".

956
01:01:36,781 --> 01:01:37,727
Scott: Yeah.

957
01:01:37,767 --> 01:01:40,118
Scott: So, if you want to go to this tour... Go to it!

958
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,567
Scott: It is not over.

959
01:01:42,553 --> 01:01:43,660
Scott: Brooklyn is tonight.

960
01:01:44,261 --> 01:01:45,526
Rym: I think that one was sold out.

961
01:01:45,787 --> 01:01:48,317
Rym: They're gonna be in Atlanta, North Carolina, Nashville...

962
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:50,546
Scott: Yeah, mostly they're going down south.

963
01:01:50,666 --> 01:01:54,140
Scott: Texas, California, Arizona, Georgia, New Orleans.

964
01:01:55,901 --> 01:02:02,380
Scott: If it's not sold out near you, until the middle of October, you should go to this show.

965
01:02:02,983 --> 01:02:03,979
Rym: You absolutely should.

966
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:07,186
Rym: Problem is, now I just want to do nothing but go to shows.

967
01:02:07,267 --> 01:02:11,600
Rym: I see why there are people who just go to shows and that's kind of their whole hobby.

968
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,180
Scott: I've been going to a lot of shows.

969
01:02:13,461 --> 01:02:14,166
Rym: As have we!

970
01:02:14,488 --> 01:02:15,494
Rym: We're just going to different shows.

971
01:02:15,535 --> 01:02:16,340
Rym: This is where we converge.

972
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,759
Rym: Because you don't care about that electro swing stuff I'm into.

973
01:02:19,742 --> 01:02:21,340
Scott: No, I don't need to go to electro swing shows.

974
01:02:27,231 --> 01:02:29,477
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

975
01:02:29,517 --> 01:02:34,490
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

976
01:02:34,890 --> 01:02:39,890
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

977
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:42,837
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

978
01:02:42,977 --> 01:02:47,570
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

980
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:55,461
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

981
01:02:55,641 --> 01:02:58,530
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

982
01:02:58,730 --> 01:03:26,008
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights are... I'm sorry for the stinger here, but Scott forced my hand.

983
01:03:28,372 --> 01:03:33,490
Rym: If you have lost track of what has come up in this episode that might have become the stinger, then I apologize.

984
01:03:34,090 --> 01:03:36,702
Rym: But it's going to be stuck in your head for at least a few weeks.

985
01:03:37,345 --> 01:03:38,470
Rym: And yeah, enjoy.

986
01:03:41,821 --> 01:03:44,091
Media: I am mighty Agamemnon.

987
01:03:44,412 --> 01:03:46,179
Media: I am tasty like a London.

988
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:49,370
Media: I sail to Troy with the navy.

989
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:51,519
Media: I taste great with spuds and gravy.

990
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:54,438
Media: Agamemnon, Agamemnon, I am king Agamemnon.

991
01:03:57,741 --> 01:04:00,211
Media: I command all of the archives.

992
01:04:00,312 --> 01:04:02,079
Media: Roughly up at guess mark five.

993
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:05,331
Media: All Achaeans, bow to me.

994
01:04:05,632 --> 01:04:07,280
Media: I am great with rosemary.

995
01:04:07,722 --> 01:04:10,639
Media: Agamemnon, Agamemnon, I am king Agamemnon.

996
01:04:13,481 --> 01:04:15,395
Media: Agamemnon, Agamemnon, I am king Agamemnon.

997
01:04:19,082 --> 01:04:21,512
Media: I command bad killer Achilles.

998
01:04:21,632 --> 01:04:23,479
Media: Why not half me with some peas?

999
01:04:24,421 --> 01:04:26,751
Media: I spill entrails of our Trojan foes.

1000
01:04:26,831 --> 01:04:28,779
Media: A nice with garlic, don't you know?

1001
01:04:29,702 --> 01:04:31,899
Media: Agamemnon, Agamemnon, I am king Agamemnon.

1002
01:04:34,942 --> 01:04:37,198
Media: Agamemnon, Agamemnon, I am king Agamemnon.

1003
01:04:40,231 --> 01:04:42,530
Media: Agamemnon, Agamemnon, I am king Agamemnon.
