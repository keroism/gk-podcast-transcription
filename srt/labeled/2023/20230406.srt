00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,662
Rym: It's Thursday April 6th 2023.

2
00:00:07,662 --> 00:00:12,292
Rym: I'm Rym And this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:16,630
Rym: We were talking about stadiums Colosseum's arenas and the like.

4
00:00:17,153 --> 00:00:23,416
Rym: let's do this sir, it's warm today like Shockingly warm.

5
00:00:24,641 --> 00:00:25,886
Scott: Yeah, well, it's it's really.

6
00:00:25,906 --> 00:00:27,673
Scott: it's strange because on the one hand it did get.

7
00:00:27,713 --> 00:00:30,340
Scott: you know, this is you know It's not cold, right?

8
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:34,237
Scott: I would like it to be warmer, but this is my watch while I was running.

9
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:36,782
Rym: It was 77 right.

10
00:00:36,823 --> 00:00:38,808
Scott: my watch right now says it's 76.

11
00:00:38,808 --> 00:00:39,310
Scott: You know what?

12
00:00:40,052 --> 00:00:40,513
Scott: That's fine.

13
00:00:40,533 --> 00:00:44,382
Scott: That's you know, I'm not gonna complain if it's 76.

14
00:00:44,382 --> 00:00:45,466
Rym: You and I are it of a corn.

15
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:49,180
Rym: I wanted to be like 84 and sunny and higher.

16
00:00:50,001 --> 00:00:51,346
Scott: The number can't be too high.

17
00:00:51,367 --> 00:00:54,840
Scott: There's no number that would be high that I would complain, right?

18
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:55,241
Scott: It's good.

19
00:00:55,261 --> 00:00:55,482
Scott: We can go.

20
00:00:55,522 --> 00:01:00,200
Scott: I can go to the other side the the Sun facing side of mercury and I could be warmer.

21
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,186
Rym: So I would I know a closer.

22
00:01:02,346 --> 00:01:27,367
Rym: what I'm curious about is I would at least once like to be in either Hyderabad or Singapore with you at the height of their summer and I'm just curious to see if your opinion would change because I have been in 120 degree heat and While it didn't kill me I would prefer to not be in that heat for too long unless I'm like in a sauna or on a beach that I can escape from That to somewhere.

23
00:01:27,408 --> 00:01:33,219
Rym: that is not that hot Mmm, I think my upper limit of comfort is about a hundred and five if it's dry.

24
00:01:33,339 --> 00:01:41,177
Scott: ish Mmm, but I mean, you know, I walked through the desert and I you know, I wasn't upset at all.

25
00:01:41,217 --> 00:01:53,523
Rym: Uh-huh, but So the sad thing is I was looking at the weather stuff cuz you know The weather has been more variable for the last several years as we know like anyone who lives can notice that and scientists agree that's true.

26
00:01:53,543 --> 00:01:57,985
Rym: it is way more variable and it's solely because of Advancing climate change.

27
00:01:58,246 --> 00:02:02,040
Rym: climate change doesn't mean everything gets hotter immediately means everything gets more fucked up and variable.

28
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:05,368
Rym: But there's talk that at least in the New York City area.

29
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:10,084
Rym: This is very likely to be the hottest summer ever Recorded.

30
00:02:10,866 --> 00:02:15,104
Rym: Yes, and I think Scott and we're gonna treat that I'm gonna treat this the same way.

31
00:02:15,224 --> 00:02:18,875
Rym: I treat a tornado because tornadoes cause devastation.

32
00:02:18,975 --> 00:02:19,717
Rym: They kill people.

33
00:02:19,758 --> 00:02:20,560
Rym: They are bad news.

34
00:02:21,082 --> 00:02:26,120
Rym: But I wish I wish there were no more tornadoes just like I wish there were no more hockey fights.

35
00:02:26,241 --> 00:02:27,609
Rym: But I was at a hockey game last.

36
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:29,239
Scott: wish there were no more a lot of things.

37
00:02:29,501 --> 00:02:32,797
Rym: There was a hockey fight at the fact there were a lot of hockey many many.

38
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:38,720
Rym: This was the fight in his hockey game I seen in a while in person and for a meaningless game.

39
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,124
Scott: It was way too fighty, right?

40
00:02:40,546 --> 00:02:45,120
Rym: So, uh, I may have stood up and screamed and cheered during those fights.

41
00:02:45,642 --> 00:02:50,520
Rym: I might have yelled fuck him up at one point, especially when someone deserved it, which they did.

42
00:02:50,801 --> 00:02:53,771
Rym: Yep, don't hit our goalie in the nuts with your stick.

43
00:02:53,831 --> 00:02:56,380
Rym: that is like that is a sin in hockey.

44
00:02:57,085 --> 00:03:01,664
Scott: Well, they got a $5,000 fine But I would.

45
00:03:01,684 --> 00:03:06,622
Rym: I would want to watch any hockey fight I can see and to ban hockey fighting immediately if I had the power To do so.

46
00:03:07,143 --> 00:03:12,039
Rym: I will watch any tornado in the Midwest from an open garage door sitting on a lawn chair.

47
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:15,680
Rym: But that is because I did not cause that tornado.

48
00:03:17,084 --> 00:03:25,425
Scott: As long as I'm confident enough that I can run and get to the basement if the tornado comes in my direction, yes More than once in my life.

49
00:03:25,586 --> 00:03:37,460
Rym: There was the moment of like my mom or my dad say like Pausing for a minute while we're watching it like literally watching a tornado and then saying all right garage doors closing everybody into the basement.

50
00:03:38,108 --> 00:03:40,445
Scott: Yeah, that's too close Coming this way.

51
00:03:40,465 --> 00:03:42,050
Rym: Yeah, they would never.

52
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,592
Rym: they were always.

53
00:03:42,813 --> 00:03:44,920
Rym: they would always act completely calm.

54
00:03:45,482 --> 00:03:51,300
Rym: But they were definitely not calm when they said that because my mom would like follow tornadoes in her car because it was cool.

55
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:57,217
Rym: So when mom was like, yeah, the path is perpendicular to your right that's all good.

56
00:03:57,277 --> 00:03:59,874
Scott: But if it's parallel Let's see it.

57
00:04:00,862 --> 00:04:06,097
Rym: But in some good news before I get into my actual like super bad news.

58
00:04:06,117 --> 00:04:10,750
Rym: Ah Stanley Cup's coming playoff other the playoff.

59
00:04:11,191 --> 00:04:14,320
Scott: the people are in the playoffs a whole nother week before you can go on with this news.

60
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:21,707
Rym: yeah, the playoffs are set for the non wildcard teams and No wildcards are locked in.

61
00:04:21,807 --> 00:04:28,579
Rym: so there is like a knife fight and a crab bucket Among the people trying to get the wildcard slot and everyone else is just lynched.

62
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,245
Rym: They're just waiting for the playoffs to start.

63
00:04:30,305 --> 00:04:34,580
Rym: like yeah, there's a little bit of seed contention, but it's not that big a deal.

64
00:04:35,163 --> 00:04:37,315
Rym: I guess nobody wants to go against Boston in round one.

65
00:04:37,356 --> 00:04:37,979
Rym: But what are you gonna do?

66
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,880
Scott: I still say it's mad that there are 82 hockey games, right?

67
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,120
Scott: Because it's so asymmetrical.

68
00:04:43,843 --> 00:04:45,208
Scott: There should really be I forget.

69
00:04:45,228 --> 00:04:46,793
Scott: I think it's seven when I did the math.

70
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:52,008
Scott: I think it might have been 70 something Basically, there's right now, right?

71
00:04:52,088 --> 00:04:56,440
Scott: There are four divisions in two conferences and each of the divisions is eight teams.

72
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:59,089
Scott: It's perfectly even eight eight eight eight four thirty-two.

73
00:04:59,109 --> 00:04:59,590
Rym: Thank you.

74
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:00,614
Rym: recent expansions.

75
00:05:01,276 --> 00:05:07,814
Scott: So you want to see Every possible team should come to every possible building one time each right.

76
00:05:07,834 --> 00:05:09,860
Rym: who tops the main bit, right?

77
00:05:10,021 --> 00:05:20,440
Scott: So therefore you should play Every team and every other division right which is 24 teams and the three other divisions twice once home once away.

78
00:05:20,841 --> 00:05:22,827
Scott: So 24 times 2 is 48, right.

79
00:05:23,829 --> 00:05:27,580
Scott: and then you want to play the teams that are in your own division.

80
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:28,660
Scott: Right.

81
00:05:29,364 --> 00:05:31,594
Scott: more than that, right because they're in your division.

82
00:05:31,614 --> 00:05:32,760
Scott: You should play them more frequently.

83
00:05:32,861 --> 00:05:43,400
Rym: I like is this vision is like a competitive boundary but also because practically if Everybody played everybody equally that is a lot of flying and that is bad for the world and bad for the players, right?

84
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,599
Scott: But you are one of the teams in your division.

85
00:05:47,423 --> 00:05:49,010
Scott: You don't have to play yourself, right?

86
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:49,994
Scott: So it's not eight.

87
00:05:50,094 --> 00:05:51,400
Scott: It's seven, right?

88
00:05:51,681 --> 00:05:53,880
Scott: So it's seven other teams in your division.

89
00:05:54,201 --> 00:05:56,407
Scott: You should play them four times each.

90
00:05:56,768 --> 00:05:58,193
Scott: seven times four is 28 28 plus 48.

91
00:05:58,193 --> 00:06:00,841
Scott: Yes 76.

92
00:06:00,841 --> 00:06:06,600
Rym: There should be 76 NHL games per season and before you wait, how do they balance it out?

93
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:11,662
Rym: Well, they kind of just decide like yeah, it's like instead there's 82.

94
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:16,840
Scott: So there's basically just because they want to make more money and sell more tickets to more games that are mostly meaningless.

95
00:06:17,141 --> 00:06:23,749
Scott: They tack on six games to every season against who knows what team And it's just like right now.

96
00:06:24,111 --> 00:06:27,469
Rym: I say if they're gonna do that it asymmetrizes Everything.

97
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:31,198
Rym: they should do that Sort of how the NFL has those games like.

98
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:32,829
Rym: oh, hey These two teams are just gonna play in London.

99
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:34,439
Rym: because why not like for this one guy?

100
00:06:34,941 --> 00:06:37,540
Scott: Well, well technically one of those teams is the home team.

101
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:50,940
Scott: But technically but NFL has a symmetrical system where each season you rotate which of the other Divisions you're gonna your division is gonna play against more because obviously you don't play against every team every year.

102
00:06:51,040 --> 00:07:01,799
Scott: Yeah, you play against each team in your division, which is only four teams, right twice Home and away and then based on what year it is you cycle through the other.

103
00:07:02,462 --> 00:07:06,557
Scott: You know teams that are out there and it's it actually makes perfect sense.

104
00:07:06,697 --> 00:07:12,969
Rym: Yep so, uh, yeah the game last night was pretty good and See hockey's coming.

105
00:07:12,989 --> 00:07:22,270
Rym: I'm not gonna curse anything, but I'm excited to see at least some number of playoff hockey games where the Rangers are playing.

106
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:27,425
Scott: in those games you you may see none if they Win enough of them.

107
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:33,290
Rym: so in some bad news and this is news that I don't think a lot of people Realized was happening because one it happened.

108
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:39,940
Scott: It's literally the top news on every news Yeah, but it happened real fast and I didn't know about it till this morning.

109
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:47,006
Rym: It's basically a today only now and while it had been talked about before and this has been talked about in a lot of places But Tennessee is where it's happening first.

110
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:49,214
Rym: It evolved so quickly.

111
00:07:49,234 --> 00:07:50,639
Rym: This is one of those things that went from.

112
00:07:51,442 --> 00:07:56,727
Rym: People who are experts would say things like oh that could happen But it would never really happen.

113
00:07:57,108 --> 00:08:03,212
Rym: and then very rapidly went to oh not only can it happen The Republicans just fucking did it like right now live out of nowhere.

114
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:03,332
Rym: Yeah.

115
00:08:03,352 --> 00:08:05,640
Scott: I mean if you know, that's people.

116
00:08:06,962 --> 00:08:08,807
Scott: If it can happen, right?

117
00:08:08,828 --> 00:08:10,131
Scott: It's like it's the same thing.

118
00:08:10,152 --> 00:08:12,077
Scott: people joke about what's that platinum coin.

119
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:12,960
Scott: platinum coin can happen.

120
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,160
Rym: Yeah, feel like we might need that platinum coin before long and you know what?

121
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,907
Rym: I still think Biden's just fucking do it.

122
00:08:18,329 --> 00:08:19,495
Rym: just print the platinum coin.

123
00:08:19,535 --> 00:08:19,836
Scott: Why not?

124
00:08:19,877 --> 00:08:20,580
Scott: Why not do it now?

125
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:20,901
Scott: What do you?

126
00:08:20,921 --> 00:08:22,107
Scott: why do you got to wait for there to be the?

127
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,574
Rym: I don't think I say.

128
00:08:23,635 --> 00:08:25,484
Rym: just do it because one thing That's what I say.

129
00:08:25,524 --> 00:08:26,248
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

130
00:08:26,348 --> 00:08:27,856
Scott: Why wait for the crisis moment.

131
00:08:27,876 --> 00:08:29,803
Scott: Just do it get a Problem.

132
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:38,046
Rym: people who pay attention you see like the politician who's on the right side of history or at least the relatively better side Of history makes a big move.

133
00:08:38,347 --> 00:08:38,909
Rym: Yeah, fine.

134
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:39,472
Rym: I'll support it.

135
00:08:39,974 --> 00:08:43,269
Rym: and the people who aren't paying that much attention They won't understand or care.

136
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:48,072
Rym: They won't remember the coin when it comes to the election It's not gonna influence whether or not they vote or not.

137
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:49,760
Rym: Like it's not gonna have any consequences.

138
00:08:49,841 --> 00:08:50,834
Rym: So just do it.

139
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,087
Rym: but so basically what's happening?

140
00:08:53,107 --> 00:09:04,360
Rym: and I'm gonna skip over all the details because this could be hours of talking but I'll link to an article and NPR that explains like the details of how this happened why it happened what the impact is.

141
00:09:04,421 --> 00:09:17,245
Rym: but basically Tennessee in America is a state that Likely would be a left-leaning Democratic state but is heavily gerrymandered inside of itself Basically to prevent non-white.

142
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:34,535
Scott: basically, there's Nashville and there's Memphis which are two cities of actually mostly Democratic people not white people, you know that are really cool You know their car places, but other than being car places Those are pretty cool cities and the rest of Tennessee is a not good place.

143
00:09:34,776 --> 00:09:38,889
Scott: That is very sparse Let's just say fashy and unpopulated Right.

144
00:09:40,206 --> 00:09:48,080
Rym: So the state basically Gerrymandered all the progressive and non-white votes into a small number of districts as happens all over America.

145
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,386
Rym: And it's not.

146
00:09:49,406 --> 00:09:52,320
Rym: this is not a different situation from a lot of these states in America.

147
00:09:52,721 --> 00:09:54,827
Rym: So a minority of the population.

148
00:09:54,847 --> 00:10:06,724
Scott: but also it does need to be said right that you know without the gerrymandering The if you just take the total population of Tennessee, right it, you know, these are people that vote, you know Senators are right-wing.

149
00:10:06,905 --> 00:10:07,927
Scott: Yeah, so it's a total.

150
00:10:08,088 --> 00:10:10,294
Scott: the total voting population is still majority.

151
00:10:10,334 --> 00:10:14,424
Rym: not good though, partly because voter suppression Prevents a lot of people.

152
00:10:14,484 --> 00:10:15,487
Rym: That's also.

153
00:10:15,567 --> 00:10:20,280
Rym: that's also a fact and voter suppression is controlled by the people we're about to talk about.

154
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:36,239
Rym: So the Republican Party the fashy party has like a mega majority in the state in the Tennessee like State House so They can technically just vote to kick anyone out for any reason just like, you know our house could at the federal level.

155
00:10:37,661 --> 00:10:51,299
Rym: So they just decided to kick the three Democrats out that represent these like not super white districts just because they're Democrats and They're just doing it the first one actually breaking right before we started the show.

156
00:10:51,761 --> 00:10:53,649
Rym: The first vote finished and one of them was kicked out.

157
00:10:53,890 --> 00:11:01,615
Rym: They're gonna kick the other two out and this is This is extremely dangerous to American democracy because it is highly likely other.

158
00:11:01,876 --> 00:11:03,120
Scott: Well, they get to vote new people in.

159
00:11:03,421 --> 00:11:05,238
Rym: Yep, they could vote the same people in.

160
00:11:06,406 --> 00:11:07,319
Rym: We'll see what happens.

161
00:11:07,741 --> 00:11:08,965
Rym: But this is the.

162
00:11:09,065 --> 00:11:25,389
Rym: all I'm gonna say is this is the kind of thing that was happening in state Legislatures in the equivalent of purple states in America in the 20 years leading up to the actual Civil War and nothing like this Has happened since the 1800s until just now.

163
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:32,440
Rym: April 6 2023. so I Don't think there'd be a Civil War like Sherman style.

164
00:11:32,642 --> 00:11:40,060
Rym: I don't think I'm like that but It could look a lot like what the troubles looked like in Northern Ireland long term if things continue to go down this road.

165
00:11:42,604 --> 00:11:43,991
Rym: hmm, so read up on this.

166
00:11:44,092 --> 00:11:53,153
Rym: this is a Big crazy history happening and there's a lot to talk about there But we really have time to get into it in GeekNights on a Thursday.

167
00:11:53,394 --> 00:11:54,780
Rym: Also, I'm hungry and it's nice out.

168
00:11:55,204 --> 00:11:55,953
Rym: So what do you got?

169
00:11:55,994 --> 00:11:56,378
Rym: any news?

170
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:05,720
Scott: Well, I don't have a specific single news, I just want to say that in general right now It's like for some reason a mega movie season is happening.

171
00:12:05,901 --> 00:12:12,390
Rym: Oh, yeah, not just a mega movie season but a weirdly high percentage of these movers or movies I do actually want to see at some point.

172
00:12:12,752 --> 00:12:14,100
Scott: Okay, so let's so we got to go.

173
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:17,360
Scott: So first of all, I guess we'll talk about it when Rym gets a chance to see it.

174
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,180
Scott: But I saw Susan made the new Makoto Shinkai movie which came out actually a little while ago.

175
00:12:22,301 --> 00:12:24,358
Scott: But it's you know, it's gonna be in the US.

176
00:12:24,982 --> 00:12:30,069
Rym: Remember this is the one with the chair and if you know if you know what I'm talking about You know what I'm talking about, right?

177
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,075
Scott: So I saw the premiere.

178
00:12:31,176 --> 00:12:31,920
Scott: Shinkai was there.

179
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,733
Scott: We'll talk about it on as soon as room sees it on a Wednesday show, right?

180
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:37,399
Scott: Yeah, but you can see that soon.

181
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,889
Scott: There's the Mario movie, which I haven't seen.

182
00:12:40,909 --> 00:12:42,394
Scott: I expect it to be bad.

183
00:12:43,116 --> 00:12:44,340
Scott: I've seen some ads for it.

184
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:44,894
Scott: That's about it.

185
00:12:45,401 --> 00:12:51,880
Scott: But everything I've heard and also I assumed before I heard is that it's just gonna be a fan service fiesta.

186
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:58,410
Scott: So I'm assuming it's to be bad, but I probably see it anyway, all right There's dungeons and dragons movie which we already mentioned.

187
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:00,840
Scott: a couple people are saying it's good.

188
00:13:01,001 --> 00:13:04,820
Scott: I saw a I guess an added off was a full trailer a partial trailer.

189
00:13:05,881 --> 00:13:08,129
Scott: I'm not personally interested but people said it's good.

190
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:12,484
Scott: So I think if you're the kind of person who actually likes a D&D Oh, I'm gonna go further.

191
00:13:12,504 --> 00:13:13,429
Rym: You know what?

192
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:14,614
Rym: I saw the best review.

193
00:13:14,654 --> 00:13:17,125
Rym: It wasn't like a newspaper review It was just some nerd on reddit.

194
00:13:17,466 --> 00:13:20,760
Rym: They basically said don't the Dungeons and Dragons movie.

195
00:13:21,102 --> 00:13:24,720
Rym: Imagine if one of those live streams of D&D was actually good.

196
00:13:25,521 --> 00:13:27,869
Scott: Yeah, so anyway, so there's that that's exists.

197
00:13:27,909 --> 00:13:32,607
Scott: at least I'm not gonna see that one spider-verse - ah must watch Just what what?

198
00:13:32,868 --> 00:13:33,431
Scott: what did you say?

199
00:13:33,451 --> 00:13:34,074
Rym: I diverse?

200
00:13:34,094 --> 00:13:35,621
Scott:  oh, yeah We're gonna.

201
00:13:35,641 --> 00:13:38,289
Scott: the spider-man movie has actually come the animated one.

202
00:13:38,309 --> 00:13:40,555
Scott: Yeah, it's coming much sooner than I thought isn't it?

203
00:13:40,575 --> 00:13:42,300
Rym: Like absolute must-watch movie.

204
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,308
Rym: I'm seeing that one in the theater like no question.

205
00:13:44,348 --> 00:13:46,577
Scott: Yeah, you know, we all go in in New York.

206
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,862
Scott: We love spider-man Especially.

207
00:13:48,943 --> 00:13:52,155
Scott: and then yeah, I saw John wick for already.

208
00:13:52,175 --> 00:13:55,245
Scott: I mean I don't.

209
00:13:55,285 --> 00:13:56,959
Scott: I guess I'm not gonna tell you anything that happens in it.

210
00:13:57,486 --> 00:13:58,278
Rym: I still have it.

211
00:13:58,581 --> 00:14:02,898
Rym: We were planning to watch John wick 3 with red and a couple other people so I haven't actually seen 3 yet.

212
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:07,281
Scott: Well 3 is a lot better and at least in my opinion than 4.

213
00:14:07,281 --> 00:14:08,646
Rym: I mean my order is my favorite.

214
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:12,540
Rym: John wick is still 1 2 has some great scenes, but I think one is a better movie.

215
00:14:13,323 --> 00:14:15,872
Scott: Well 4 is basically just sort of like.

216
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:17,880
Scott: first of all, it's really long, right?

217
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:21,771
Rym: So it's like I like a long wordy lock me in a theater for four hours daddy.

218
00:14:21,792 --> 00:14:32,340
Scott: I also like a long movie, but Obviously the majority of it is just fighting with no talking or plot advancement, which is what you would expect from a John wick, right?

219
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:32,641
Scott: It does.

220
00:14:32,661 --> 00:14:36,060
Scott: that's what it's on the label is you're gonna see action scenes.

221
00:14:36,282 --> 00:14:39,406
Scott: It's like if you cut out the action scenes This movie might be 20 to 30.

222
00:14:39,406 --> 00:14:45,739
Rym: John wick is just dynasty warriors with a gun basically basically Yes, the problem is is that?

223
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:52,550
Scott: Imagine I give you like, you know, I get some Eileen's cheesecake right like the best the best cheesecake, right.

224
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:58,060
Scott: and It's like okay you eat a slice and it's like that was delicious and they eat another slice.

225
00:14:58,141 --> 00:15:00,677
Scott: It's still delicious, but you're full now, right?

226
00:15:00,918 --> 00:15:05,340
Rym: Yeah Sometimes sometimes you're like Homer in hell with the donuts and you just keep going.

227
00:15:06,567 --> 00:15:11,800
Scott: But it's like John wick for had was just so many minutes of action scenes.

228
00:15:12,382 --> 00:15:19,287
Scott: Right that like even though they would mix it up and do different things and there was still you know Something going on there and it wasn't bad.

229
00:15:19,307 --> 00:15:20,853
Scott: I was full.

230
00:15:21,214 --> 00:15:24,387
Scott: I was like just Get on with it.

231
00:15:24,407 --> 00:15:26,476
Scott: Just show me the plot already, right?

232
00:15:26,556 --> 00:15:31,980
Scott: Not that there was much plot But yeah, you know, it's like whatever.

233
00:15:33,162 --> 00:15:36,220
Scott: And there's that one and I feel like there's one more.

234
00:15:36,461 --> 00:15:38,106
Scott: Oh, and there's the the trailer.

235
00:15:38,448 --> 00:15:43,021
Scott: during while I was seeing John wick for they showed a trailer for a movie Call.

236
00:15:43,062 --> 00:15:49,220
Scott: but from this I guess simple similar studio same studio same, you know, the people that brought you whatever, right?

237
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:56,396
Rym: Called sisu which is oh, yeah Also known as a Finnish guy murders a lot of bad people.

238
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:56,477
Rym: Yes

239
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:12,794
Scott: It's basically about an old Finnish gold prospector who murders a bunch of Nazis and it's like It's but you could consider it to just be another John wick movie basically, but it's like, you know Hey, you know different character different plot different whatever might you know,

240
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:14,160
Rym: and then I'm late.

241
00:16:15,461 --> 00:16:18,064
Scott: Trailer convinced me that yeah I want to see that right.

242
00:16:18,165 --> 00:16:28,780
Rym: one more on the list that I'm actually into even though it's actually from last year and I just Slept on it is if you've seen people talking about the menu, that's my kind of horror comedy movie like straight up.

243
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:30,924
Scott: I never never heard.

244
00:16:31,064 --> 00:16:34,575
Rym: Oh, uh, if there's a trailer, but I feel like I don't know.

245
00:16:34,595 --> 00:16:36,180
Rym: the trailer looks spoilery and yeah.

246
00:16:36,561 --> 00:16:38,608
Rym: but well how I was sold on it is.

247
00:16:38,669 --> 00:16:49,779
Rym: I just saw our short clip and it was just a scene in the movie and All it is is there's a woman in a fancy restaurant and she orders a cheeseburger From a really intense and creepy chef and I was sold on this movie just from seeing that scene.

248
00:16:50,665 --> 00:16:55,955
Scott: Okay People are hype on this new Barbie movie and that seems like something I might watch.

249
00:16:56,076 --> 00:16:57,180
Scott: if it I wouldn't go to the theater.

250
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,790

287
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,839

00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:11,714
Rym: Talking about New York this this short is s-tier old, New York guys This is just a really good day.

297
00:20:11,915 --> 00:20:12,640
Rym: This is delightful.

298
00:20:12,881 --> 00:20:20,348
Rym: It is definitely worth watching and it is both nostalgic to what New York was like but also Real about like.

299
00:20:20,488 --> 00:20:22,940
Rym: not everything was great in that era of New York.

300
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:23,221
Rym: Like.

301
00:20:23,241 --> 00:20:28,319
Rym: we can't pretend that New York was perfect in the olden times and is terrible.

302
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:33,616
Rym: now There's like one of the guys went to prison for a couple of dimes after he got involved with the mob.

303
00:20:33,777 --> 00:20:37,688
Scott: So Yeah So yeah my thing of the day.

304
00:20:37,969 --> 00:20:56,195
Scott: if you watch the news in the u.s Right every time someone brings up the idea of taxing the rich right not on the federal level in the u.s But you know in the local levels then everyone's like, ah, if you tax the rich They'll leave and then you'll actually lose tote tax revenue because you'll be.

305
00:20:56,216 --> 00:20:56,718
Scott: you'll have.

306
00:20:56,818 --> 00:21:03,444
Scott: you know All those people who are in that higher tax bracket that you that you created won't even live here anymore Right now.

307
00:21:03,504 --> 00:21:07,020
Scott: they're at least paying a little bit if they're paying, you know this tax right now.

308
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:17,879
Rym: My old argument used to be face value before we get into your thing of the day was you know what good if they leave Rents come down because while we're getting less tax revenue also all their rich person bullshit goes away with them.

309
00:21:18,622 --> 00:21:24,360
Scott: Yeah, but anyway, the point is is that studies show that actually no they won't leave right there.

310
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:30,380
Scott: Basically, almost you would take you would have to set taxes to like 60 like I think they had a number in this video.

311
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:35,660
Scott: I forget what the number was but like a very high percentage before it's gets to the point where you're.

312
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:40,744
Rym: If you don't live in New York Exactly, but you know, it's.

313
00:21:40,845 --> 00:21:42,030
Scott: it's not just true for New York.

314
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:44,560
Scott: It's true for most places like that place where the person lives.

315
00:21:44,941 --> 00:21:45,905
Scott: They've set down roots.

316
00:21:45,965 --> 00:21:47,290
Scott: That's where the people they know are.

317
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,474
Scott: that's where their business is.

318
00:21:48,534 --> 00:21:50,100
Scott: It's like moving isn't easy.

319
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:54,060
Scott: It's actually harder to move when you're rich because you've got so much shit, right?

320
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:58,040
Scott: It's like if you're you know poor and you don't have a lot of stuff moving is can you know?

321
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,826
Scott: Expensive moving is difficult.

322
00:21:59,886 --> 00:22:03,880
Rym: The most expensive moving is lower middle-class American family, right?

323
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,640
Scott: But the roots that you have set down are not as much right?

324
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:12,062
Scott: It's like if I had less stuff I could just pick up all my stuff and get in a van and also think a rich Person.

325
00:22:12,383 --> 00:22:17,903
Rym: they're living exactly where they want to be living because money is no barrier to that Yep.

326
00:22:18,605 --> 00:22:35,706
Scott: But anyway, so this person did sort of like this video Which is sort of like it reads sort of like a Daily Show segment or you know, whatever Where they go around and they're like, you know calling rich people are ringing on their doorbells and being like hey You know taxes are going up.

327
00:22:35,726 --> 00:22:38,840
Scott: We're gonna we'll help you move and they're not interested, right?

328
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:39,962
Scott: It's a whole.

329
00:22:40,343 --> 00:22:49,540
Scott: it's a whole bit about basically to drive home the point that like no they won't leave Tax them more right but it's in a in a comedic and funny in a funny way.

330
00:22:50,161 --> 00:23:04,540
Rym: So yeah in the meta moment the GeekNights book club book Which we're gonna try to target to do the show around the end of April the satanic verses by Sam and Rushdee Behind my the number of pages I need to read in order to.

331
00:23:04,721 --> 00:23:10,291
Rym: Yeah, I had to partly because it got real nice out When I would have been reading I went.

332
00:23:10,311 --> 00:23:17,138
Scott: the problem is is that you know I'm reading the book and then I fall asleep not because I'm bored with the book, but because I'm tired.

333
00:23:17,158 --> 00:23:18,808
Rym: Yeah Yeah, we are.

334
00:23:18,828 --> 00:23:19,351
Rym: we're in our 40s.

335
00:23:19,392 --> 00:23:20,480
Rym: So give us a give some slack.

336
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:28,675
Scott: It's like I lay on the couch and then I wake up with this You know my hand in the book and say well But if nothing else so many people have tried to murder this man because of this book.

337
00:23:28,755 --> 00:23:39,540
Rym: and if you read this book based on What I've read so far it is Really kind of insane to imagine that someone would want to murder this man over this specific book.

338
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,812
Rym: Otherwise no cons for a while.

339
00:23:43,832 --> 00:23:45,866
Rym: Uh We'll see what happens.

340
00:23:45,987 --> 00:23:48,020
Rym: Hopefully we'll see you at PAX West and PAX Unplugged.

341
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:49,925
Rym: It's gonna be summer.

342
00:23:50,327 --> 00:23:52,860
Rym: hopefully we'll do some interesting side content.

343
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:59,252
Rym: Maybe do some live streams or some GeekNights episodes outside all the stuff We were really trying to do right before a kovat hit.

344
00:23:59,353 --> 00:24:03,857
Rym: and then old technology We tried wasn't great, but I think now we have a really good setup.

345
00:24:03,897 --> 00:24:04,380
Rym: So stay tuned.

346
00:24:05,581 --> 00:24:07,228
Scott: Yeah, the website is coming along.

347
00:24:07,248 --> 00:24:08,713
Rym: I got some videos.

348
00:24:08,834 --> 00:24:11,606
Rym: all the video got Scott got from the panel We did at PAX East.

349
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,375
Rym: I think I can put something together with that.

350
00:24:13,435 --> 00:24:15,082
Rym: So gonna work on that ID.

351
00:24:15,122 --> 00:24:20,180
Rym: I need some bad weather now, I need like weather that keeps me inside long enough to edit that video together.

352
00:24:20,322 --> 00:24:30,628
Rym: So hope for some storms over here And I think we get right into it cuz I was in a hockey game last night and a fixture in my life because I was not.

353
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:36,104
Rym: grew up in Detroit moved to Rochester now, I live in New York City and Go to a lot of sports.

354
00:24:36,204 --> 00:24:39,695
Rym: Like I enjoy watching people compete in a variety of sports.

355
00:24:39,795 --> 00:24:43,968
Rym: I went to monster truck shows Which there are some sports and competitions there.

356
00:24:44,008 --> 00:24:47,960
Rym: It's not just rolling it like the it's not just rolling over cars for fun.

357
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,591
Rym: They also ostensibly have some amount of competition.

358
00:24:50,611 --> 00:25:09,122
Rym: a lot of hockey a lot of basketball various levels of hockey and basketball including extremely amateur levels and anyone who goes to a lot of sports has a lot of opinions on the different arenas and venues and places that sports happen and a Sports.

359
00:25:09,183 --> 00:25:12,836
Scott: but other large entertainment events, you know the big concerts.

360
00:25:12,996 --> 00:25:14,000
Scott: Yeah, mostly big concerts.

361
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,840
Rym: Let's leave convention centers out of this though because that gets a little we're talking about.

362
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:27,848
Scott: you know an arena or you know a a stadium or a colosseum or you know a place where there is a Central area of attention.

363
00:25:27,968 --> 00:25:31,200
Scott: Yeah and a large number of seats in one room.

364
00:25:31,602 --> 00:25:42,196
Rym: Yeah, right like, you know a circus circuses, you know A Place where there's only one thing going on and everyone is there to see that one thing.

365
00:25:42,236 --> 00:25:53,808
Scott: but a circus has three rings right, but not we're gonna not include things like, you know an opera house or a Hall right where it's like you're.

366
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,539
Scott: it's really only for one thing like, you know, you go it's.

367
00:25:56,599 --> 00:26:00,679
Scott: you know It's it's a it's a multi-purpose sort of arena, right?

368
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:04,107
Rym: But also that's when they're big enough.

369
00:26:04,127 --> 00:26:08,480
Scott: basically, you know modern equivalents of the Colosseum in Rome were there.

370
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:12,771
Scott: I don't know historically were there colosseums before the Colosseum or was that the first one?

371
00:26:12,811 --> 00:26:17,363
Rym: there were arenas all over Lots.

372
00:26:17,403 --> 00:26:18,369
Scott: they weren't like that one.

373
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:19,335
Scott: Well, there was.

374
00:26:19,355 --> 00:26:20,200
Scott: that was like the biggest.

375
00:26:20,463 --> 00:26:22,060
Rym: There are proto versions like that.

376
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:29,620
Rym: But yeah, that was basically like the one the government was like, alright This is we're gonna make the big one because we don't want anyone to riot in the city.

377
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,560
Scott: There weren't bigger ones that just no don't look exist any longer.

378
00:26:33,102 --> 00:26:38,640
Rym: Uh, not that I know of and I'm qualifying there just because I'm not a hundred percent sure.

379
00:26:39,101 --> 00:26:45,540
Scott: Yeah, and then as time went on I guess, you know, the any of the modern ones are basically children of that one.

380
00:26:45,741 --> 00:26:45,861
Scott: I've

381
00:26:45,881 --> 00:27:01,658
Rym: never been to that one, but I have been to the chariot arena in the in Constantinople the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire Which is huge and has the serpent column in it and there's there's cool stuff there And actually the track is like still there like the course that they ran.

382
00:27:01,678 --> 00:27:02,180
Rym: it's pretty cool.

383
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:20,038
Rym: but the other thing about these big arenas and venues and like colosseums is that Because of their scale and because they are designed fundamentally to host the maximum number of people Like you think of these as an unlimited number of people effectively would go to this thing if they could.

384
00:27:20,058 --> 00:27:20,760
Rym: how do we get as?

385
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,227
Rym: Many people into this thing.

386
00:27:22,851 --> 00:27:23,635
Rym: They're all bespoke.

387
00:27:23,836 --> 00:27:24,580
Rym: They're all unique.

388
00:27:24,903 --> 00:27:34,557
Rym: They're not just cookie cutter like the jolos arena that I watched the Red Wings in as a kid is So different from Madison Square Garden that they are like different kinds of buildings.

389
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:35,823
Scott: Yeah Well, I mean that's.

390
00:27:36,004 --> 00:27:36,707
Scott: I think that's the thing.

391
00:27:36,747 --> 00:27:39,139
Scott: is it every time someone makes one of these right?

392
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:46,936
Scott: They really you know There are a lot of things in common between them now But no one ever really makes the same one twice because you've got a different place.

393
00:27:47,037 --> 00:27:47,760
Scott: You're putting it in.

394
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:51,046
Scott: Yeah, you've got a different, you know Kind of culture.

395
00:27:51,106 --> 00:27:54,200
Scott: you have a different kinds of events that are going to be held there.

396
00:27:54,581 --> 00:27:58,640
Rym: Are you a city that can have a place that only does hockey or do you need that place to also do?

397
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,460
Rym: Basketball because hockey is not that big.

398
00:28:01,122 --> 00:28:06,000
Scott: You've got different, you know laws and regulations in the place where you're building this thing, right?

399
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:24,056
Scott: You have different interests, you know, and there's just so many hands and any time one of these things is made Right so that they're all unique and interesting but also in their own ology and best practices change Way faster than they can should and do.

400
00:28:24,096 --> 00:28:24,780
Rym: build these things.

401
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:30,619
Rym: So every one that gets built is already the state of the art unless it's in a city that fucks it up.

402
00:28:31,201 --> 00:28:34,614
Rym: so like I like I have a lot of nostalgia for the Joe Louis Arena.

403
00:28:34,935 --> 00:28:42,139
Rym: the new arena they play in is Objectively just better in every depends in which you know what you're counting as better, right?

404
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:55,859
Rym: Yeah I mean sometimes they fuck up and make it worse But like I could it is how it was hard in say the 1940s to put as many seats in say a hockey arena as we can do with modern technology.

405
00:28:55,939 --> 00:29:07,306
Rym: today in 2023 like like look at Madison Square Garden, which is already pretty old They got this whole like third level that is just hanging from the inside of the facility You couldn't add 40s.

406
00:29:07,707 --> 00:29:08,670
Scott: Well, they added that on.

407
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,753
Scott: Yeah wasn't there?

408
00:29:09,794 --> 00:29:12,463
Rym: that couldn't have been built in 1940.

409
00:29:12,463 --> 00:29:18,850
Scott: No, it was a renovation it wasn't you know a built thing, yeah But you know, it's like some places you like you're.

410
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:22,833
Scott: yet you're in the United States, you know in Boston You get your Fenway Park right.

411
00:29:23,216 --> 00:29:29,100
Scott: in Chicago You got your Wrigley Field like super old baseball stadiums, right and those super old baseball stadiums.

412
00:29:29,503 --> 00:29:37,117
Scott: They sort of because they're so old Right, they sort of have a character in a history because they managed to not destroy them like everyone else.

413
00:29:37,157 --> 00:29:37,939
Scott: did you know who?

414
00:29:38,384 --> 00:29:42,320
Scott: Upgraded You know, so they managed to hold on to those for so long.

415
00:29:42,480 --> 00:30:00,639
Scott: It's like well now you're stuck with them and they have deficiencies, right and they lack some modern accoutrement that you can't really fix because they're just too small or they're too old, right you can only do so much You know, you don't want to ruin it and but they can renovate to some extent, right?

416
00:30:02,001 --> 00:30:07,648
Scott: But it's like yeah, and the problem is you get things like well Fenway Park, you know Some of the seats aren't good.

417
00:30:07,668 --> 00:30:10,907
Scott: You could be sitting behind a post or You could.

418
00:30:11,088 --> 00:30:14,485
Rym: there there are Islanders where they used to play like.

419
00:30:14,505 --> 00:30:16,310
Rym: there are literally just huge sections.

420
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:17,835
Rym: You can't see anything right?

421
00:30:18,055 --> 00:30:21,086
Scott: They're like, you know, they'll be Not enough seats.

422
00:30:21,267 --> 00:30:24,420
Scott: and it's like yeah, we have a huge event here, but we don't have enough tickets.

423
00:30:25,004 --> 00:30:26,960
Scott: So the price is on the tickets.

424
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:27,980
Scott: We do have a fortune.

425
00:30:28,341 --> 00:30:29,746
Scott: Where's some other bigger stadium?

426
00:30:30,087 --> 00:30:34,200
Scott: the ticket prices can at least get down a bit because there's a little more supply going on.

427
00:30:35,047 --> 00:30:36,460
Scott: More of the seats can see better.

428
00:30:37,621 --> 00:30:40,512
Scott: You know, you have weird things like I guess again Fenway Park.

429
00:30:40,532 --> 00:30:42,840
Scott: They have the big green monster in left field, right?

430
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,116
Scott: It's like no one would make a baseball stadium like that today.

431
00:30:45,136 --> 00:30:48,130
Scott: now It's sort of a character thing, right?

432
00:30:48,451 --> 00:30:50,580
Scott: But yeah, it's also makes the game a bit.

433
00:30:52,422 --> 00:30:52,964
Rym: The red wings.

434
00:30:53,004 --> 00:31:01,008
Rym: before the Joe they used to play in the the Olympia and I remember my family would always talk about like going Redwings games in that old facility.

435
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:13,119
Rym: the state the stairs and the seats were so steep that according to family legend Many people would fall and seriously injure themselves every single game trying to get into and out of their seats.

436
00:31:13,179 --> 00:31:14,538
Rym: drunk Yep.

437
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:21,496
Scott: But yeah, it's like I've been going to stadiums sir, you know, I guess since I knew what the hell was going on.

438
00:31:21,516 --> 00:31:25,240
Scott: Yeah Some of them don't exist anymore.

439
00:31:25,571 --> 00:31:25,779
Rym: Yeah.

440
00:31:26,101 --> 00:31:32,707
Rym: And also there's the trend that a lot of the places I went as a kid were named after famous people Named after places like.

441
00:31:32,747 --> 00:31:35,200
Rym: they had just local character color names.

442
00:31:35,723 --> 00:31:43,820
Rym: but most of the places now like the Red Wings played in the Olympia and then they played in a Joe Louis arena and now they play in the Little Caesars arena.

443
00:31:44,482 --> 00:31:45,585
Scott: Well, hold on now, right?

444
00:31:45,646 --> 00:31:47,792
Scott: So the the thing there it's not.

445
00:31:47,993 --> 00:31:49,618
Scott: people think that that's like a change.

446
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:51,670
Scott: that's happened Right, it's.

447
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:53,100
Scott: I don't think that's a change at all.

448
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,094
Rym: You know the ones that didn't have these commercialized names were the rare ones for a long time.

449
00:31:57,516 --> 00:31:58,780
Scott: No, no, no, that's not at all.

450
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:01,187
Scott: They've always had a commercialized name, right?

451
00:32:01,508 --> 00:32:06,304
Scott: It wasn't named Shea Stadium because they wanted to honor Mr.

452
00:32:06,687 --> 00:32:06,808
Scott: Right.

453
00:32:06,828 --> 00:32:08,380
Scott: It's cuz there was a rich guy named Shea.

454
00:32:08,621 --> 00:32:13,420
Scott: That's why it's just the rich people used to put their own fucking name on the stuff Carnegie Hall or whatever.

455
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:17,576
Scott: Yeah, and then there are no rich people would to put their names on it.

456
00:32:17,817 --> 00:32:22,171
Scott: the rich company It's just whoever was rich at the time put their name on the thing that Detroit set.

457
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:23,756
Rym: We just named it after Joe Louis.

458
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:31,880
Scott: I Guess so, but the exceptions Joe Louis, I guess once he was success and the Olympia was just called Olympia Stadium, right?

459
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:36,233
Scott: Well, the the exceptions for example would be like in New York.

460
00:32:36,414 --> 00:32:38,340
Scott: There was the Polo Grounds.

461
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,223
Scott: Yeah, right.

462
00:32:39,505 --> 00:32:40,609
Scott: That was it was literally named.

463
00:32:40,629 --> 00:32:42,296
Scott: It was the place where they played polo.

464
00:32:42,316 --> 00:32:43,120
Scott: It's like it did.

465
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:44,490
Scott: They didn't have a name for it.

466
00:32:44,551 --> 00:32:45,720
Scott: It was just the polo ground.

467
00:32:46,121 --> 00:32:50,940
Scott: And then the other exceptions would be things like Yankee Stadium giant stadium.

468
00:32:51,061 --> 00:32:53,953
Scott: It's named after what goes on there primarily, right?

469
00:32:54,114 --> 00:32:55,439
Rym: I do like that style a little bit.

470
00:32:56,162 --> 00:33:00,680
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know, you could just call it med stadium, but they they never did that, right?

471
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,526
Scott: Yeah, but yeah now, you know, it's like.

472
00:33:02,727 --> 00:33:11,299
Scott: but I can agree that you know a name of a person Even though even if it was originally just a rich person slapping their own name on there, right?

473
00:33:12,122 --> 00:33:13,966
Rym: Over time it's forgotten.

474
00:33:14,227 --> 00:33:19,440
Scott: people don't know who the person was or what it means or anything unless they look it up on Wikipedia, right?

475
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:24,479
Scott: and so what ends up happening is that just ends up being a word that has no meaning.

476
00:33:24,499 --> 00:33:31,700
Scott: and Because it has no meaning it doesn't feel commercialized in any way shape or form especially that person's dead, right?

477
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:39,142
Scott: Whereas a brand, you know the Citi Field or the MetLife Stadium here America Park Fucking.

478
00:33:39,463 --> 00:33:46,443
Scott: but they in LA they had the Staples Center which used to be something else and that was the crypto calm arena Which is the worst ever.

479
00:33:46,464 --> 00:33:48,831
Rym: that is actually the worst one on earth.

480
00:33:48,871 --> 00:33:50,415
Scott: That's the worst one, right?

481
00:33:50,596 --> 00:33:57,097
Scott: Because it has a Name that is a brand that you actually associate with something.

482
00:33:57,579 --> 00:34:06,316
Scott: now You have the sort of double association where it's like you're got a cup a brand Right and this building and that's what that's their intent.

483
00:34:06,457 --> 00:34:16,000
Rym: Obviously, that's work except it's Like if there was a comp USA or you know, that would just be really funny and they kept it that way forever.

484
00:34:16,982 --> 00:34:25,306
Scott: Yeah, I mean I like the ones personally where like you said Joe Louis arena where it's named after someone not because of money But because of worth right.

485
00:34:25,366 --> 00:34:28,460
Scott: the tennis over here is Arthur Ashe Stadium, right?

486
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,949
Scott: Over in Australia, right?

487
00:34:32,371 --> 00:34:34,219
Scott: It's a rod lever state, right?

488
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,335
Scott: It's like they named after someone who was fucking great at tennis.

489
00:34:37,396 --> 00:34:38,020
Scott: Yeah, right.

490
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,023
Scott: It's like.

491
00:34:39,283 --> 00:34:43,275
Scott: it's not named after the rich person or the company or what happened.

492
00:34:43,295 --> 00:34:48,956
Scott: It's not just called tennis arena As a name with a. it's like that.

493
00:34:49,036 --> 00:34:54,237
Scott: that's good Like if you had a hockey arena and you just called it Wayne Gretzky arena, right?

494
00:34:54,257 --> 00:34:55,040
Scott: That's what it's like.

495
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:55,984
Scott: It's like that would be good.

496
00:34:56,406 --> 00:35:08,027
Rym: But in our in New York, you know Madison Square Garden That is it is its own company and venue and like media empire by itself Mmm owned by a piece of shit guy.

497
00:35:08,168 --> 00:35:09,775
Rym: Oh, yeah, that guy sucks like full disclosure.

498
00:35:09,815 --> 00:35:10,377
Rym: Fuck him.

499
00:35:10,578 --> 00:35:19,439
Rym: and also One thing I can say about MSG because every read is different and I got a lot of anecdotes about arenas I've been to with pros and cons and such.

500
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:26,080
Rym: MSG is The hardest arena to get out of I have ever been to in my life.

501
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:29,819
Rym: It takes it takes a while to get out of that place.

502
00:35:30,482 --> 00:35:32,829
Scott: It's pretty similar to a giant stadium.

503
00:35:32,869 --> 00:35:36,300
Scott: was in giant when you went to giant stadium with the one that doesn't exist anymore.

504
00:35:36,761 --> 00:35:41,959
Scott: basically, there were these spiral ramps on the corners right and they weren't stairs they were ramps.

505
00:35:41,979 --> 00:35:46,351
Scott: and Basically, it's like after the game you would exit.

506
00:35:46,431 --> 00:35:49,260
Scott: you just get what you had to get to one of the corners of giant stadium.

507
00:35:49,382 --> 00:36:00,071
Scott: I think there might have been some in the middle but you had to get to one of these ramps and Basically, you'd have to walk all the way down unless you were sitting way low I guess but you walked all the way down this big spiral.

508
00:36:00,412 --> 00:36:05,953
Scott: It took a long time And eventually you got to the bottom right.

509
00:36:06,154 --> 00:36:14,720
Rym: all the listener points out What about the NCAA and college arenas that often have like Michigan State like they're often just called like Spartan Stadium or something.

510
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,223
Rym: I like that.

511
00:36:15,283 --> 00:36:15,786
Rym: That's true.

512
00:36:15,927 --> 00:36:16,289
Scott: That's true.

513
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:17,799
Scott: But the other thing about the center.

514
00:36:18,961 --> 00:36:23,274
Scott: Well, at least the United States the college football stadiums are actually the biggest ones.

515
00:36:23,434 --> 00:36:25,400
Scott: they have the big capacity, right?

516
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:28,979
Scott: It's like Madison Square Garden conceit, you know for hockey.

517
00:36:29,059 --> 00:36:32,530
Scott: It's 18,006 seats total for for basketball.

518
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:36,080
Scott: It's a little bit more right the the college football stadiums.

519
00:36:36,381 --> 00:36:41,399
Scott: Some of them are like a hundred thousand plus like five Madison Square Gardens worth of people and they fill them up.

520
00:36:41,641 --> 00:36:49,031
Rym: Yeah, so Giants the Giants play in an arena that holds 80,000 people right now according to my life stadium.

521
00:36:49,071 --> 00:36:51,177
Scott: Yeah, New York Giants football giant.

522
00:36:51,197 --> 00:36:58,540
Rym: Yes the Place that Michigan State football plays seats almost the same number of people.

523
00:37:00,182 --> 00:37:02,170
Rym: Yep, and other ones are way bigger than that.

524
00:37:02,211 --> 00:37:03,878
Rym: Michigan State is not the biggest or the best.

525
00:37:04,078 --> 00:37:06,836
Rym: Sorry drew My brother went to MSU, but most of my friends went to U of M.

526
00:37:06,856 --> 00:37:09,665
Scott: So Yeah, you know the.

527
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:11,132
Scott: I think I really good.

528
00:37:11,212 --> 00:37:20,780
Scott: if you want to talk about college places Right a place that I'm familiar with because it was in Connecticut where I lived for 16 17 years right is the Yale Bowl, right?

529
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:21,862
Scott: So it's like.

530
00:37:22,003 --> 00:37:26,439
Scott: basically that's like the ancestor of all the college stadiums in the u.s.

531
00:37:27,023 --> 00:37:28,313
Scott: Effectively like it's still there.

532
00:37:28,374 --> 00:37:32,710
Scott: They still use it But like it's basically like the old.

533
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,178
Scott: you want to see what it's like old and busted right?

534
00:37:35,299 --> 00:37:37,609
Scott: It's like it's just like these.

535
00:37:37,629 --> 00:37:39,000
Scott: I Mean.

536
00:37:39,021 --> 00:37:42,880
Scott: if you look at a picture of it, you'll see it's literally just like a bowl, right?

537
00:37:43,022 --> 00:37:43,878
Scott: It's not like.

538
00:37:44,884 --> 00:37:46,399
Scott: You know an arena that's built up.

539
00:37:46,841 --> 00:37:52,537
Scott: It's like it's like cut out of the ground almost like this little dish and it's not very deep whatsoever.

540
00:37:52,617 --> 00:37:54,622
Scott: It's just wide Right.

541
00:37:55,786 --> 00:37:59,620
Rym: Oh, so I looked up because you know RIT, you know the hockey we talked about a lot and old GeekNights.

542
00:38:00,023 --> 00:38:02,504
Rym: We we used to go see at the Ritter Which was free.

543
00:38:02,524 --> 00:38:03,107
Scott: they have a new one.

544
00:38:03,127 --> 00:38:04,514
Scott: They built a new one right after we left.

545
00:38:04,594 --> 00:38:08,206
Rym: So the Ritter's seated 2100 people 1600 sitting 500 standing.

546
00:38:08,226 --> 00:38:09,953
Rym: I went to many a game where I stood.

547
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:19,480
Rym: I Have a lot of fond memories that place the gene Pulisani Center the one that they built right as we were leaving named after a rich guy who paid for it.

548
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,714
Rym: Yep seats more than double that.

549
00:38:22,418 --> 00:38:25,811
Scott: Yep Yep, one consider much nicer.

550
00:38:26,254 --> 00:38:27,420
Rym: another consideration on the seating.

551
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:33,871
Rym: That's interesting is that part of the reason why NCAA venues are just so big it's partly that They're gonna be filled.

552
00:38:33,912 --> 00:38:34,800
Rym: because of school spirit.

553
00:38:35,181 --> 00:38:43,960
Rym: They're often actually cheaper to go to or at least the tickets are sold cheaper and are often allocated to students Forget there is a secondary market and scalping and stuff up and all that stuff.

554
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:48,197
Rym: but like tickets are generally directly cheaper because they just want to fill it.

555
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:51,708
Rym: but like You don't build a hockey arena.

556
00:38:51,728 --> 00:38:54,619
Rym: That's not gonna mostly sell out on purpose.

557
00:38:56,381 --> 00:39:05,527
Rym: There are a lot of cities that build smaller arenas on purpose to make sure they sell out rather than having empty capacity For a lot of historical and capitalist reasons.

558
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:06,610
Rym: Mm-hmm.

559
00:39:07,212 --> 00:39:10,040
Scott: All right, so let's let's go through some arena related topics, right?

560
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:12,671
Scott: So the first of all talk about some dome action, right?

561
00:39:12,691 --> 00:39:14,840
Scott: So some of them got roofs and some of them don't got roofs.

562
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,485
Scott: Yeah, right.

563
00:39:16,505 --> 00:39:18,271
Scott: and in my opinion, right?

564
00:39:18,371 --> 00:39:21,020
Scott: It's like I think some of the roofs, right?

565
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:26,962
Scott: I mean having a roof is kind of good because you can play when there's bad weather but for game for certain sports Right.

566
00:39:27,304 --> 00:39:31,540
Scott: bad weather is charming like a man football who doesn't love a football in the snow?

567
00:39:31,883 --> 00:39:37,659
Rym: I have a lot of issues with American football But something I deeply respect about it is that the rules are basically they play no matter what?

568
00:39:38,721 --> 00:39:39,405
Scott: Almost no matter.

569
00:39:39,465 --> 00:39:46,352
Rym: Yeah, I mean if there's a tornado like barreling toward the arena It's a lot more tolerant than other sports to bad weather like football in the snow.

570
00:39:46,372 --> 00:39:48,859
Rym: that I got kind of like watching.

571
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:53,435
Scott: actually Right, but if you have a dome you lose that charm right to.

572
00:39:53,495 --> 00:39:54,660
Scott: some of the domes can be ugly.

573
00:39:54,860 --> 00:40:00,520
Scott: Yeah, old old domes like a lot of the older shittier ones stopped working properly and stuff, right?

574
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,123
Scott: That's that's not.

575
00:40:01,143 --> 00:40:10,614
Scott: there's a few big ones that have been stuck for a long time Yeah, but it's also kind of nice right like for baseball Let's say where they will just at the one drop of rain.

576
00:40:10,654 --> 00:40:13,528
Scott: They stopped playing baseball Almost right where it's like.

577
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:14,433
Scott: you bought tickets.

578
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:15,439
Scott: you want to go to the game?

579
00:40:16,441 --> 00:40:20,540
Scott: If they have the dome or roof, it's like great, you know, I've been to games so there's been a rain delay.

580
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,920
Scott: We'd sit around waiting for hours or you have to leave and come back another day.

581
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,912
Scott: Yeah, and it's just nice to be able to ensure that you buy a ticket.

582
00:40:27,952 --> 00:40:31,012
Scott: you're gonna go and at that time You know, the game will happen.

583
00:40:31,072 --> 00:40:37,180
Rym: Yeah, right There's good ice hockey where you're really got to play indoors and climate change is only gonna make that worse.

584
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:44,140
Rym: But occasionally you get like the winter classic like the special game that's in a like bespoke or one-time use.

585
00:40:44,381 --> 00:40:48,318
Scott: Yeah, my knowledge whether hasn't spoiled any winter classics yet.

586
00:40:48,498 --> 00:40:52,500
Rym: Yeah I feel like that'll come someday unless they just move them further and further north.

587
00:40:52,781 --> 00:40:53,744
Scott: It would be awesome if it.

588
00:40:53,905 --> 00:40:57,859
Scott: you know, there might have been one word wet bad weather, but I just didn't know about it.

589
00:40:58,322 --> 00:40:59,348
Rym: Yeah, I'd like that.

590
00:40:59,368 --> 00:41:01,099
Rym: I feel like it snowed a little bit during one of them.

591
00:41:02,201 --> 00:41:04,951
Rym: Maybe I vaguely recall that but it wasn't enough to affect the game.

592
00:41:04,971 --> 00:41:05,875
Rym: I wish it had.

593
00:41:06,196 --> 00:41:06,838
Rym: I just like that.

594
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:08,743
Rym: but There's the.

595
00:41:09,064 --> 00:41:10,149
Rym: how do you get to it and leave it?

596
00:41:10,209 --> 00:41:11,214
Rym: Cuz one big thing.

597
00:41:11,555 --> 00:41:23,080
Rym: Oh, yeah arenas in big if all of cities that are dense and have mass transit are Fundamentally different in a lot of ways from a suburban stadium out in the middle of nowhere.

598
00:41:23,801 --> 00:41:37,900
Scott: Yep, so for just to give you an example or a most when you have a stadium that is not in a downtown of a city It's usually surrounded by parking lots that are empty most of the time and it's not great.

599
00:41:38,389 --> 00:41:38,940
Rym: I think it sucks.

600
00:41:39,101 --> 00:41:51,160
Rym: I think that actually mutes a lot of the benefits in arena could bring to a community because it is just this capitalist event outside of any community Fully surrounded by horrible parking lots and cars and nightmare traffic.

601
00:41:51,481 --> 00:41:55,759
Rym: It makes the lives of everyone who live near it miserable and it doesn't benefit them in any way.

602
00:41:56,562 --> 00:42:05,101
Scott: Yep, and it's like even look at you know over City Field over there and Shea Stadium before it you know with all those parking lots and it's like That's.

603
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:09,135
Scott: you know, if there were houses on that land, you know, how many people you could house?

604
00:42:09,256 --> 00:42:11,482
Scott: Yeah, it's about Valuable.

605
00:42:11,522 --> 00:42:15,315
Scott: that land is in housing there and raise the price of the houses.

606
00:42:15,355 --> 00:42:16,640
Scott: the seven train goes there.

607
00:42:16,987 --> 00:42:17,399
Rym: How about this?

608
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,282
Rym: He's all houses there.

609
00:42:18,322 --> 00:42:18,503
Rym: right.

610
00:42:19,085 --> 00:42:24,020
Rym: every house gets four season tickets so they can lease them out or do whatever they want with them.

611
00:42:24,622 --> 00:42:31,160
Scott: I'm just saying it's like it's a. it's a real shame to not to just have that land be used on Parking but also flat parking lot.

612
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,335
Scott: It's not even a parking garage.

613
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:36,458
Rym: This leads to a much bigger externality that if you don't live in America, you might not realize.

614
00:42:36,478 --> 00:42:40,720
Rym: so Drunk driving in America is actually one of the biggest killers of humans.

615
00:42:40,841 --> 00:42:42,911
Rym: Like it is it is like up there.

616
00:42:42,931 --> 00:42:48,040
Scott: it is guns, right right now It's pretty much guns and cars are the two things that kill Americans the most.

617
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:56,383
Rym: yep, but drunk driving is a huge problem in America and a Scary percentage of it is caused directly by the arenas We just described.

618
00:42:56,644 --> 00:43:01,340
Rym: because people there's no way to get to most sports venues in America except by driving there.

619
00:43:01,742 --> 00:43:06,528
Rym: a lot of people like to drink alcohol while they're watching sports and Then they stop selling it to you.

620
00:43:06,609 --> 00:43:08,780
Scott: after a certain point people will hold on to it.

621
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:12,080
Scott: Yeah, you know the buy a whole bunch at the second intermission and then drink.

622
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:20,315
Rym: Yeah, I'm not allowed to buy beer in like the last quarter of a football game But I can buy as much beer as I want two seconds before that quarter starts.

623
00:43:20,415 --> 00:43:21,480
Rym: like that doesn't make sense.

624
00:43:22,701 --> 00:43:24,126
Scott: It makes sense for the people who are making money.

625
00:43:24,147 --> 00:43:27,759
Rym: so does but even then, you know, I've had alcohol.

626
00:43:29,062 --> 00:43:32,160
Rym: One quarter of a football game is not enough time for all the beers.

627
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:34,573
Rym: You're not even close to get back down to a blood alcohol.

628
00:43:34,613 --> 00:43:35,920
Rym: That is legal or reasonable?

629
00:43:36,841 --> 00:43:41,996
Scott: I wonder if we could do a study like comparing a number of DUIs after games with ot versus without ot.

630
00:43:42,317 --> 00:43:49,980
Rym: Oh, I Remember being stuck at that crazy like many ot game at MSG and of course, you know all the employees like they stopped serving food.

631
00:43:50,442 --> 00:43:51,767
Rym: I was desperately hungry.

632
00:43:52,148 --> 00:43:53,112
Rym: Everything was shut down.

633
00:43:53,413 --> 00:43:54,276
Rym: There's nothing to eat.

634
00:43:55,059 --> 00:44:01,300
Scott: Yep So just you know some interesting getting to and from stories right obviously mad square garden.

635
00:44:01,561 --> 00:44:04,730
Scott: It's like I guess you could drive to it and park in a parking garage.

636
00:44:04,931 --> 00:44:06,576
Rym: a lot of people scarily do.

637
00:44:07,077 --> 00:44:17,314
Scott: it's a bad idea mostly Jersey people right, but I Once drove to Fenway Park for the all-star game, right and the parking garage.

638
00:44:17,334 --> 00:44:20,723
Scott: This is a 19 maybe early 2000 I forget late 90s.

639
00:44:21,063 --> 00:44:25,481
Scott: You can look it up because that the all-star game hasn't been there that often right and The.

640
00:44:25,682 --> 00:44:31,440
Scott: I remember distinctly in that this is at least 20 years ago the parking garages that were right next to Fenway.

641
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:32,504
Scott: We didn't park at those ones.

642
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:33,789
Scott: We parked further away, right?

643
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:35,375
Rym: Same large earnings games.

644
00:44:35,957 --> 00:44:44,536
Scott: They were charging Like city bucks in the nose that was a hundred.

645
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:45,460
Scott: this is an all-star game.

646
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:46,540
Scott: Yeah, this wasn't a normal game.

647
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,913
Scott: But even you know Boston parking is already out of control, right?

648
00:44:50,194 --> 00:45:00,940
Rym: It's probably $150 normally Those arenas I think 50 bucks just to park it packs not counting the valet charge for one by MetLife MetLife Stadium.

649
00:45:01,121 --> 00:45:13,710
Scott: Right these state it's like, you know, even if even though they're surrounded by parking lots They still don't have enough parking and you have to buy a separate parking pass permit Right to park your car at the stadium.

650
00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:16,220
Scott: Otherwise you to park at some other lot somewhere.

651
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:19,670
Rym: Yeah, I take like a bus or walk like 20 minutes if

652
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:35,340
Scott: you want to go see football New England Patriots football in Foxborough, Massachusetts Right, basically you get off the highway at this exit and there's this road and on the road It's basically nothing but like motels and stuff and people selling like parking spots on their grass.

653
00:45:35,541 --> 00:45:40,204
Scott: Right and as you get closer to the stadium the prices go up Right.

654
00:45:40,625 --> 00:45:45,318
Scott: and then eventually when you get all the way to the stadium, it's like well if you want to park at the stadium I hope you have a parking pass.

655
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:46,162
Scott: Yeah, right.

656
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:50,373
Scott: and so basically there's this whole culture of you drive and this one road.

657
00:45:50,453 --> 00:45:52,860
Scott: everyone parks somewhere on that road, right?

658
00:45:53,220 --> 00:46:05,192
Scott: However much they're willing to walk before and after the game or whether they have a pass or not And the road is one way before the game starts and then sometime during the game They switch the road to be one way backwards.

659
00:46:05,212 --> 00:46:15,500
Scott: Yeah, I Don't know if they might keep one lane separately or something for you know But it's uh, it's like this weird at this whole weird setup for going to and from this thing.

660
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:19,890
Scott: This is in the middle of nowhere by itself Right, just just for events.

661
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:25,989
Rym: so that I remember as kids cuz you know We go to Red Wings games when we could like we weren't rich But we got to go to Red Wings games and when we go we drive.

662
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:31,573
Rym: cuz while there was the mass transit within and around Detroit there's no way to get to go to where your house was.

663
00:46:31,613 --> 00:46:32,396
Scott: Yeah, so we

664
00:46:32,416 --> 00:47:01,063
Rym: drive and the rule was We would either walk out in the last four minutes of the game to get to our contract to GTFO or We would just stay in our seats for like 40 minutes before even considered leaving Because if you left when the game ended you would sit in your car Slowly moving through the parking garage for and I'm this is zero exaggeration over an hour like minimum It was.

665
00:47:01,163 --> 00:47:03,533
Rym: it took so long to get out of that parking garage.

666
00:47:03,895 --> 00:47:06,329
Rym: it was just a nightmare You know, that's the thing.

667
00:47:06,369 --> 00:47:20,043
Scott: if you'd bring your car to the stadium We basically a game had to be like ridiculously close exciting for us to actually stay Right to the complete end if we card to the game because we had to get to the car early to get the hell out Of there, right?

668
00:47:20,104 --> 00:47:23,739
Scott: I remember distinctly one time where we went to.

669
00:47:24,641 --> 00:47:36,013
Scott: It was Patriot Saints in Foxborough, right and there was like almost no time left on the clock whatsoever, right and They the Saints were up and the Saints got an interception.

670
00:47:36,033 --> 00:47:38,564
Scott: Yeah, as soon as they caught that interception We're like it's over.

671
00:47:38,945 --> 00:47:39,949
Scott: Yeah, and we get.

672
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:42,400
Scott: we just got up and left because there were not not much time left.

673
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:47,644
Scott: Right and we go or get to the car we get in the car Right and we eat.

674
00:47:47,724 --> 00:47:53,751
Scott: whether eat whether you left a game early or not, right or you would customarily turn the radio on to the game Right.

675
00:47:53,995 --> 00:48:03,000
Rym: Oh, yeah I have a lot of memories of sitting in that traffic in the parking garage Listening to the last few minutes of the game on the radio Right or sometimes it would just be the post game if you actually did stay to the end.

676
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:17,382
Scott: But we're in the car and then we hear people outside the car freaking out Right and then after some short delay the radio is freaking out and it's like well, I guess you shouldn't have left that game Right.

677
00:48:17,402 --> 00:48:21,399
Scott: Tom Brady found a way with the the remaining time on the clock.

678
00:48:21,439 --> 00:48:23,739
Scott: somehow I'm sure someone can look up and see what game that was.

679
00:48:23,981 --> 00:48:26,953
Scott: But it's like if we didn't have to car that wouldn't happen.

680
00:48:26,974 --> 00:48:28,460
Scott: We would have seen the whole game even at MSG.

681
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:31,390
Rym: So we Emily and I were at that crazy many overtimes game.

682
00:48:31,751 --> 00:48:40,260
Rym: a lot of people left after the first OT Because they had to catch their train back to New Jersey like or they don't have a good way to get home.

683
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:41,343
Rym: So they had to leave.

684
00:48:41,685 --> 00:48:49,115
Rym: and even now like any game you're at a lot of people leave MSG early and it is almost Exclusively people who live in New Jersey who have to catch a train.

685
00:48:49,859 --> 00:48:53,350
Scott: Yep So let's talk about quickly seating right.

686
00:48:53,410 --> 00:48:55,617
Scott: so most arenas they got seats at different heights.

687
00:48:55,837 --> 00:48:59,459
Scott: Yeah, right Usually higher is and farther back is cheaper.

688
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:02,070
Rym: But the seats themselves are also different.

689
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:02,933
Rym: in a lot of arenas.

690
00:49:02,973 --> 00:49:04,800
Rym: the class depends depends.

691
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:08,191
Scott: Yes, some of them outdoor ones sometimes even just have benches or whatever.

692
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:10,900
Rym: I sat on metal hard bleacher.

693
00:49:11,001 --> 00:49:12,351
Scott: But we went to the game in Buffalo.

694
00:49:12,391 --> 00:49:13,539
Scott: We sat on the steel benches.

695
00:49:14,882 --> 00:49:18,980
Rym: I went a lot of tires game sitting on metal benches like behind the outfield.

696
00:49:19,562 --> 00:49:22,252
Scott: Yeah, there aren't a lot of metal benches these days in the newer places.

697
00:49:22,332 --> 00:49:22,452
Scott: Now.

698
00:49:22,493 --> 00:49:24,460
Scott: It's mostly at least a plastic folding seat.

699
00:49:24,781 --> 00:49:31,580
Scott: Yeah minimum, but nowadays some of the places have put it in like squishy recliner expensive seeds with cupholders and massage.

700
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:32,959
Scott: There's like, you know all kinds of non.

701
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:38,258
Rym: But then different sports have different traditions and different setups like basketball has really close to basketball.

702
00:49:38,278 --> 00:49:38,860
Scott: You're in a folding.

703
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:43,400
Rym: Yeah, this is like they just set up regular like normal folding chairs like it ever on a poker table.

704
00:49:43,661 --> 00:49:46,275
Rym: Just yeah, cuz right next to the game like you could reach out.

705
00:49:46,296 --> 00:49:49,160
Scott: like other sports It's really safe to sit close to basket.

706
00:49:49,301 --> 00:49:56,267
Rym: Well, it's like worst case a heavy guy bumps into you and apologizes or a basketball bumps into you like, okay Wait, and most people think that's pretty cool.

707
00:49:56,307 --> 00:49:58,415
Rym: Oh, yeah, Jack like fell on me.

708
00:49:58,435 --> 00:50:00,331
Rym: I would just be like, sorry shack Sorry, I was in your way.

709
00:50:01,324 --> 00:50:07,779
Scott: It's like, you know people love that Hockey puck, I don't wanna I don't want that to hit me, you know, nothing to do with it.

710
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:09,343
Scott: Baseball.

711
00:50:09,363 --> 00:50:10,047
Scott: you got a big net.

712
00:50:10,168 --> 00:50:10,691
Scott: Thank good.

713
00:50:10,731 --> 00:50:11,496
Scott: You don't want to get hit by that.

714
00:50:11,516 --> 00:50:13,515
Rym: if you're a little kid You probably have your catchers met with you.

715
00:50:14,363 --> 00:50:15,716
Scott: Yeah, but you still don't want to get hit by that.

716
00:50:15,776 --> 00:50:17,779
Scott: Yeah That's too dangerous.

717
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:22,880
Scott: But not only that but you also have some luxury box action, right?

718
00:50:24,861 --> 00:50:28,136
Scott: I've been a few a few but work never never except for work.

719
00:50:28,759 --> 00:50:31,649
Scott: Yeah There's a few different kinds of luxury boxes these days.

720
00:50:31,729 --> 00:50:35,020
Scott: Most arenas have three kinds at least main three main kind.

721
00:50:35,221 --> 00:50:35,983
Rym: That's a good point.

722
00:50:36,064 --> 00:50:37,067
Rym: They are different now.

723
00:50:37,429 --> 00:50:39,536
Scott: There's there's one kind which is the.

724
00:50:39,556 --> 00:50:46,680
Scott: I Have I'm having a group event like a birthday party and I shelled out big and there's a special box just for that.

725
00:50:46,821 --> 00:50:48,239
Scott: Yeah, that's like a luxury box.

726
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:54,423
Scott: That's Kez catering or whatever right and pretty much anyone can get that if you pay enough money and it's not like in the old RIT arena.

727
00:50:54,684 --> 00:50:58,618
Rym: there was one luxury box technically and you could just rent it like just pay money.

728
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:01,427
Scott: Yep Yep, the second kind is the.

729
00:51:01,788 --> 00:51:05,920
Scott: there are many small luxury boxes and each of them is individually owned, right?

730
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:06,121
Scott: Like.

731
00:51:06,181 --> 00:51:07,909
Scott: I've sat in like at various events.

732
00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:10,060
Scott: I was in like a Pepsi luxury box once right?

733
00:51:10,461 --> 00:51:22,620
Scott: Pepsi owned that box or at least it or whatever and basically no matter what event was held in that arena Stadium Right Pepsi there were some seats that were in the box, right?

734
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:24,899
Scott: Pepsi had the rights to those seats.

735
00:51:25,221 --> 00:51:25,563
Scott: You couldn't.

736
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:28,598
Scott: just no one else could buy those tickets except Pepsi the company.

737
00:51:29,241 --> 00:51:30,669
Rym: And that's something a lot of people don't know.

738
00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:35,133
Rym: that if you want if you own a luxury box Yeah, you got to buy tickets to anything you want to write kid.

739
00:51:35,153 --> 00:51:36,420
Scott: Just so it's like, okay, right?

740
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:39,780
Scott: So let's say there's a BTS concert at the stadium, right?

741
00:51:40,243 --> 00:51:42,880
Scott: Pepsi doesn't just automatically get tickets to that.

742
00:51:43,321 --> 00:51:49,220
Scott: They just have these tickets for those seats that are set aside and they can either buy them or not.

743
00:51:50,222 --> 00:51:53,139
Scott: And if they buy them they can give them to whoever they like, right?

744
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,970
Rym: But nobody said no one goes.

745
00:51:56,151 --> 00:51:57,840
Scott: that box sits there empty, right?

746
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:03,459
Scott: Even though Pepsi can decorate the box all they want, you know They can get free catering in the box when they use it.

747
00:52:03,761 --> 00:52:06,399
Scott: They could all this, you know get all this bonuses along with the box.

748
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:10,114
Scott: But you have to buy tickets to sit in your own box if you want to.

749
00:52:10,415 --> 00:52:25,664
Scott: you just basically have Guaranteed tickets to any event that were to happen in that space Unless you know I guess sometimes there might be like a concert and if the state your your box might be like behind the stage and not available In which case tough cookies.

750
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:28,311
Scott: Yep, and the third kind right?

751
00:52:28,933 --> 00:52:30,277
Scott: There's a lot of places have this.

752
00:52:30,457 --> 00:52:31,480
Scott: it's basically the club.

753
00:52:31,761 --> 00:52:35,220
Scott: There'll be some kind of sponsored club or multiple sponsored clubs.

754
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,660
Rym: I feel like there's a lot more of these lately like over there.

755
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:42,155
Scott: They're very popular because they're all sponsored right and basically what these are.

756
00:52:42,215 --> 00:52:48,880
Scott: it's a way for a wealthy person To basically have a season ticket, but the season ticket is in this club.

757
00:52:49,482 --> 00:52:54,500
Scott: So it's like they share a luxury box with many other rich people that they don't know, right?

758
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:57,860
Scott: They couldn't afford to just reserve a whole box just for themselves.

759
00:52:58,623 --> 00:53:13,373
Scott: But they're wealthy enough that they can get a season ticket that comes with like in a special zone With like their own bar and their own wait staff and their own everything Right and their own special luxuries and fancy seats and TVs and lounges.

760
00:53:13,754 --> 00:53:16,100
Scott: It's sort of like every airplane lounge deal.

761
00:53:16,442 --> 00:53:17,306
Scott: Right now you're in there.

762
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:24,800
Scott: You have enough money to get special treatment But you're in there with all the other people you don't know that also have paid for special tree.

763
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,607
Rym: They're a lot like airport lounges.

764
00:53:26,627 --> 00:53:28,917
Scott: Yes, you know, they're not bad though.

765
00:53:28,937 --> 00:53:29,680
Scott: They usually good seats.

766
00:53:29,801 --> 00:53:31,858
Scott: I've been in them a couple times and I gotta say I like.

767
00:53:31,878 --> 00:53:33,462
Rym: I Have pro.

768
00:53:33,482 --> 00:53:34,324
Scott: there are pros and cons.

769
00:53:34,344 --> 00:53:37,053
Rym: the luxury box if I was mega-rich, I might.

770
00:53:37,454 --> 00:53:52,620
Rym: I would also consider I could see Family luxury box and like just bring people to it and see games, but yeah gotta remember Luxury boxes are not necessarily the best way to see a sport if the sport itself is what you care about because they're fun.

771
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:53,385
Rym: Like don't get me wrong.

772
00:53:53,486 --> 00:53:55,439
Rym: I don't I don't dislike a luxury box.

773
00:53:55,861 --> 00:54:00,580
Rym: If someone invites me to one like in May, I guess we're gonna get a big box for my team at Yankee Stadium.

774
00:54:00,761 --> 00:54:02,226
Rym: So I'm gonna go there and see a game.

775
00:54:02,748 --> 00:54:12,661
Rym: I tried to convince them for the Mets and they were not here to me, but They aren't the best seats compared to like the actually expensive good seats Like.

776
00:54:13,323 --> 00:54:13,484
Scott: nope,

777
00:54:13,765 --> 00:54:14,928
Rym: if you want if you care about

778
00:54:15,249 --> 00:54:17,315
Scott: some some places they are but usually rarely

779
00:54:17,376 --> 00:54:26,134
Rym: like you really care about hockey And you want to sit like near the glass like if you like sitting close Sitting in the lower ring is way better than sitting in the luxury boxes.

780
00:54:26,175 --> 00:54:27,199
Rym: They're pretty high up.

781
00:54:27,623 --> 00:54:29,159
Rym: Some of them are even higher than where we sit.

782
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:35,482
Scott: Hmm, you know, there's also, you know depends on the arena where the luxury boxes are exactly right, you know There's.

783
00:54:35,502 --> 00:54:36,551
Scott: there might be some on the end.

784
00:54:36,571 --> 00:54:41,880
Rym: It's like, okay I've seen places where there are a few like luxury boxes that are like right down at ice level.

785
00:54:42,721 --> 00:54:43,886
Scott: Yeah, you could you could be any.

786
00:54:43,926 --> 00:54:45,011
Rym: they're like stay like like.

787
00:54:45,051 --> 00:54:47,060
Rym: you see a little dip and then there's a glass wall and some.

788
00:54:47,501 --> 00:54:52,280
Rym: There's no way to get to those seats except through a basically a secret door from the actual luxury box that's there.

789
00:54:52,641 --> 00:54:54,268
Rym: But they always often have the same format of.

790
00:54:54,308 --> 00:55:00,899
Rym: there's the box area and then there's like a bunch of seats Outside the box like at the edge of wherever the luxury box is.

791
00:55:01,662 --> 00:55:03,588
Rym: Usually those are seats you technically purchased.

792
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:05,555
Scott: Yeah now we did.

793
00:55:06,157 --> 00:55:09,980
Scott: I do want to talk about Stadium food, but I think we can make a separate episode.

794
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,340
Rym: I think we'll have to because I have a lot of opinions on stadium food.

795
00:55:13,501 --> 00:55:19,060
Scott: So much going on there, but I do just want to close briefly talking about the non sports at the arenas, right?

796
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:22,996
Scott: So, you know, I've seen like the circus at the arena, you know, it's like.

797
00:55:23,157 --> 00:55:25,700
Scott: yeah, it's fine It's a sir, you know, where else are you gonna put a sir?

798
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:30,495
Rym: I saw Sesame Street live and Muppet Babies live at Cobo Hall when I was a little kid.

799
00:55:31,117 --> 00:55:36,410
Scott: I've seen some X on ice at various, you know, maybe Hartford Civic Center.

800
00:55:36,651 --> 00:55:39,800
Rym: I saw Chris cross perform at Cobo Hall once right?

801
00:55:40,081 --> 00:55:42,731
Scott: Yes, let's have a concerts at arenas, right?

802
00:55:43,273 --> 00:55:55,155
Scott: I am not a huge fan of Concert at an even if it's someone I really really really like like my favorite band in the universe or whatever Right at an arena to go see them.

803
00:55:55,316 --> 00:56:00,660
Scott: It's like Okay, maybe it might be good if it's like that time we saw tool in Albany, right?

804
00:56:00,781 --> 00:56:03,320
Scott: It's like you don't need to see tool, right?

805
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:04,243
Scott: It's like what is there to look?

806
00:56:04,263 --> 00:56:10,786
Scott: you need to feel tool via all the people around you, right and having a giant You know general admission mosh pit.

807
00:56:10,886 --> 00:56:12,852
Scott: Okay, that works out kind of right.

808
00:56:12,972 --> 00:56:13,434
Scott: It's okay.

809
00:56:13,474 --> 00:56:15,560
Scott: I'd still rather have a smaller place though, right?

810
00:56:16,781 --> 00:56:21,360
Scott: But if it's like an act where I actually want to see them, right?

811
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:24,719
Scott: I got something to look at maybe some dancing right or some.

812
00:56:24,759 --> 00:56:26,349
Scott: you know I'm really there to listen to them.

813
00:56:26,369 --> 00:56:30,378
Scott: the acoustics are not the best in the arena Not the way they would be at a concert hall, right?

814
00:56:32,661 --> 00:56:36,800
Rym: Brooklyn Steel if I want to hear I would be in like Lincoln Center, right exactly.

815
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:39,047
Scott: So it's like an arena isn't the best for seeing.

816
00:56:39,067 --> 00:56:45,980
Scott: it isn't the best for hearing right and it's like, you know a lot of time the seeing is just gonna be like.

817
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:48,653
Scott: You know these giant video screens a lot of people set up and it's like.

818
00:56:48,673 --> 00:56:52,212
Scott: well if you're I'm just looking at video screens Why don't I just get the concert DVD and watch it at home?

819
00:56:52,635 --> 00:56:53,519
Scott: Why should I be here?

820
00:56:53,901 --> 00:56:59,503
Scott: It's like and they charge so much more money because it costs so much more money to set this thing up Right.

821
00:56:59,924 --> 00:57:00,265
Scott: It's like.

822
00:57:00,727 --> 00:57:04,180
Scott: I'm just not a fan of any concert no matter how much I like the group.

823
00:57:04,521 --> 00:57:08,794
Rym: So what I am a fan of and you can't always do this is some concerts.

824
00:57:09,135 --> 00:57:16,292
Rym: you can get the luxury box tickets And if you go to a luxury box at a big stadium concert with a bunch of friends It just becomes a hangout.

825
00:57:16,352 --> 00:57:17,340
Rym: or our concerts happening.

826
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:24,800
Rym: But that unless you get a good deal or get lucky that is a lot of money for a very relatively diminished return.

827
00:57:25,921 --> 00:57:40,451
Scott: Now I am gonna you know caveat by saying any time the few times I've gone to an arena concert It was always a general admission or a faraway seat or I was never paying big money to get close because I Didn't care enough to get close.

828
00:57:40,491 --> 00:57:41,680
Scott: I wasn't gonna I didn't have the money.

829
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:47,632
Scott: I wasn't gonna spend that much right, but there is an upcoming K-pop concert right.

830
00:57:47,693 --> 00:57:57,339
Scott: mamamoo is coming to The islanders place EBS, right and I'm like, I'm like, alright, they've never come here before it's or they're probably not gonna come again.

831
00:57:57,801 --> 00:57:59,024
Scott: Right, we like them.

832
00:57:59,064 --> 00:58:01,410
Scott: they're like the best live ever right.

833
00:58:01,851 --> 00:58:04,739
Scott: so it's like let's pay to get close at least right.

834
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,280
Scott: so We can see we're in like the 12th row.

835
00:58:07,361 --> 00:58:09,920
Rym: It cost a shit ton of money like the last time I went to Lincoln Center.

836
00:58:10,021 --> 00:58:13,184
Rym: It was a. it was a classical like piano act I was really interested in.

837
00:58:13,264 --> 00:58:17,535
Rym: so we sat in the second row and you know what those seats cost a lot more than a hockey game.

838
00:58:18,341 --> 00:58:19,347
Scott: Yeah, but for that I could.

839
00:58:19,367 --> 00:58:21,017
Scott: you could have sit far away and it would be in the mezzanine.

840
00:58:21,037 --> 00:58:21,460
Scott: you'd be fine.

841
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:28,093
Rym: Well, cuz it was I wanted to see too because this if you sit that close You're right next to the guy playing the piano like crazy.

842
00:58:28,113 --> 00:58:29,680
Scott: No, you want to see his hands?

843
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:30,303
Rym: Oh, yeah, it was.

844
00:58:30,705 --> 00:58:33,600
Rym: it was something to see his hands like you could hear him hitting the piano.

845
00:58:33,701 --> 00:58:35,876
Scott: It was well, I mean with kpop you want to see someone dance.

846
00:58:35,897 --> 00:58:36,340
Scott: Yeah, right.

847
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:37,266
Scott: So it's I don't need I don't?

848
00:58:37,286 --> 00:58:41,470
Rym: you don't want to be so close that you just see like their legs Right, so I'm gonna find out.

849
00:58:41,833 --> 00:58:47,020
Scott: I guess for the first time I've lived this long and I still never sat close at an arena concert, right?

850
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:56,593
Scott: So it's like is the arena concert acceptable if you pay a fortune to be fucking close as if you know You're as close as you would be in a smaller place?

851
00:58:56,613 --> 00:58:57,860
Scott: and I'll find out the answer to that.

852
00:58:58,242 --> 00:59:01,880
Scott: But again, it costs a fortune and probably isn't worth it very often at all.

853
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,235
Rym: So the listener had a comment that made me laugh.

854
00:59:04,718 --> 00:59:04,980
Rym: quote.

855
00:59:05,602 --> 00:59:23,800
Rym: I bet the line for the bathroom at that crisscross concert was needlessly long due to all the backward pants and a lot of people wore their jeans backward to that concert and it was actually a problem because it's really hard to pee and Like backward jeans are not comfortable after about 20 minutes.

856
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:27,110
Rym: But yes, I'm speaking from personal experience.

857
00:59:27,150 --> 00:59:29,780
Rym: I'm not gonna pretend I wasn't all-in on that concert.

858
00:59:30,821 --> 00:59:40,820
Rym: but last thing bathrooms, uh Bathrooms in arenas are generally the worst possible thing and are to be avoided at all cost.

859
00:59:41,322 --> 00:59:51,260
Rym: I've been in the places where you if you're a man with a penis and peeing into a trough Surrounded by easily a hundred other men some of whom are facing you on the other side.

860
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:54,230
Rym: That is that is not a great experience.

861
00:59:55,121 --> 00:59:59,880
Scott: Listen, I was like a teenager and I had basically that experience.

862
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:02,773
Scott: I was peeing at a NASCAR race deal.

863
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:06,023
Scott: You can't beat that one that Monster truck show.

864
01:00:06,786 --> 01:00:09,053
Rym: I'm just saying I think those are about equivalent.

865
01:00:09,374 --> 01:00:09,895
Rym: That is the.

866
01:00:10,216 --> 01:00:18,220
Rym: I was pissing into a trough Surrounded by men who were peeing as long as Tom Hanks in a league of their own because they had consumed more alcohol.

867
01:00:18,561 --> 01:00:22,073

868
01:00:22,515 --> 01:00:26,049

869
01:00:26,691 --> 01:00:36,220
Rym: Yeah, I was like really I Have stood in bathroom lines that were like 20 or 30 minutes long just to pee at sports events.

872
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:58,932
Rym: That's why I see a lot of people get up and run With two minutes to go in a period because they're running to piss and then to buy more beer and get back to their seat Exactly, but sometimes it's like if it's really boring or it's a blowout.

873
01:00:58,992 --> 01:01:01,780
