1
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:09,850
Rym: It's Wednesday, February 1st, 2023.

2
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:16,335
Rym: I'm Rym. I'm Scott. and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:22,940
Rym: Tonight we are talking about Ramayana the legend of Prince Rama the anime from.

4
00:00:25,663 --> 00:00:26,697
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:28,002 --> 00:00:31,556
Rym: So, uh the last I'll say about that veil ski trip is uh, like.

6
00:00:31,938 --> 00:00:32,540
Rym: I got some money.

7
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:35,473
Rym: Like I'm not rich like but I got I got money.

8
00:00:35,995 --> 00:00:38,731
Rym: Yeah, I'm doing okay I can still forward to go ski in Colorado.

9
00:00:38,751 --> 00:00:40,220
Rym: It's something a lot of you very fortunate.

10
00:00:41,761 --> 00:00:42,585
Rym: So we stayed.

11
00:00:42,807 --> 00:00:45,520
Rym: there's two main gondolas that go up that mountain.

12
00:00:45,881 --> 00:00:49,293
Rym: There's the gondola one that goes like to the big central part of the mountain.

13
00:00:49,313 --> 00:00:50,156
Rym: Everyone wants to get to.

14
00:00:50,377 --> 00:00:54,612
Scott: so this isn't a ski Lift this is a gondola like like the Roosevelt Island sky.

15
00:00:54,652 --> 00:00:56,178
Rym: Yeah, these things are huge.

16
00:00:56,438 --> 00:01:03,520
Rym: Yeah And they they don't even take you all the way up They just take you like about halfway to three quarters way up the mountain and then there's lifts all over the mountain.

17
00:01:04,361 --> 00:01:13,700
Rym: Yeah, so there's the main gondola that takes you to the better more central part up in the mountains and there's a newer gondola That's in this like side village.

18
00:01:14,121 --> 00:01:22,155
Rym: That's like a 20-minute walk away on the other side of Vale and there's a gondola in that town, too But it goes up to like the edge of the mountain.

19
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:33,925
Rym: So To go up that gondola you take like you see down to once ride a lift up ski down again And then you're in the place that the other gondola takes you in one straight shot And it's a place you kind of want to get to.

20
00:01:34,347 --> 00:01:41,342
Rym: so it's like the less convenient gondola and that side of town has fewer condos and fewer restaurants and Costs.

21
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:42,667
Scott: so basically the better spot.

22
00:01:42,847 --> 00:01:46,400
Rym: Yeah, so the cheaper spot like the the less good spot cost a third.

23
00:01:47,361 --> 00:01:50,259
Rym: What like any room would cost near the main gondola?

24
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,298
Rym: So we stayed in the cheaper side of town and the cheaper side of town had resort style.

25
00:01:54,820 --> 00:02:00,560
Rym: Expensive food like it cost as much as eating in New York, but it was about as good as eating in Philadelphia.

26
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,531
Rym: So scojo loved it.

27
00:02:04,592 --> 00:02:11,943
Rym: he thought the food was great I will tell you and it was like four out of ten on the Mexican food scale a Mexican food.

28
00:02:12,084 --> 00:02:12,405
Scott: Okay.

29
00:02:12,626 --> 00:02:15,960
Scott: Yeah, the the fan that's not the kind of food I expected to be there.

30
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,817
Rym: Well, there's also like a bunch of bars and grills and they were five out of ten and six out of ten respectively.

31
00:02:20,857 --> 00:02:21,199
Rym: those two.

32
00:02:22,082 --> 00:02:25,760
Rym: We went to a fancy place on the other side of town one night and our friend Scott.

33
00:02:26,622 --> 00:02:28,210
Rym: It was too fancy weed store for him.

34
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:39,587
Rym: He was not into the food But anyway, so we stayed in the cheaper side of town like Significantly cheaper and Unlike the third night.

35
00:02:39,928 --> 00:02:42,400
Rym: We're done skiing and we just walk over to the other side of town.

36
00:02:43,042 --> 00:02:45,130
Rym: There's that little bus and you can walk and we want to see.

37
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:54,680
Rym: uh, and I saw That the people who stay on that side of vale are a different class of having money from the class of having money that I'm in.

38
00:02:55,082 --> 00:03:01,404
Rym: It is like starkly different between the two sides of town what they're like and this is epitomized by.

39
00:03:01,725 --> 00:03:14,176
Rym: when we walked in and walked around town within four minutes of getting to that side of vale we Stopped because I saw through this through the window of a shop an item for sale and that item

40
00:03:14,477 --> 00:03:15,982
Scott: was was it a ski Shop,

41
00:03:16,344 --> 00:03:17,430
Rym: it was I'll give you a

42
00:03:17,691 --> 00:03:17,912
Scott: shop.

43
00:03:17,952 --> 00:03:19,340
Rym: was it was not a ski shop?

44
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,363
Rym: It was basically.

45
00:03:20,383 --> 00:03:21,406
Scott: I thought it was a ski shop.

46
00:03:21,446 --> 00:03:21,627
Scott: you

47
00:03:21,647 --> 00:03:23,592
Rym: think that it was a gift shop

48
00:03:24,575 --> 00:03:27,529
Scott: and it had a touristy shit Like, you know snow globes and

49
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,294
Rym: yeah stuff like

50
00:03:28,637 --> 00:03:30,743
Scott: glasses Postcards things

51
00:03:30,783 --> 00:03:37,415
Rym: the kind of person who's visiting vale and staying on that side might buy to bring like back home to their family from the trip.

52
00:03:39,521 --> 00:03:41,779
Scott: This thing like I love veil t-shirt.

53
00:03:42,061 --> 00:03:46,254
Rym: So I want to give you one guess how much this thing costs and I want to give you three guesses on what this thing was.

54
00:03:47,381 --> 00:03:48,186
Scott: Okay, well how much?

55
00:03:48,206 --> 00:03:49,895
Scott: probably tens of thousands of dollars?

56
00:03:50,016 --> 00:03:52,646
Rym: All right, it was Seventeen thousand eight hundred dollars.

57
00:03:52,726 --> 00:03:54,371
Rym: So you're actually in the ballpark.

58
00:03:54,772 --> 00:03:56,437
Rym: I'd say that you got that one.

59
00:03:56,838 --> 00:04:06,994
Rym: three guesses What the fuck it was and I'll be probably some high fashion brand Bag coat fashion item that it was not there were.

60
00:04:07,094 --> 00:04:08,540
Rym: I saw Gucci skis.

61
00:04:08,741 --> 00:04:15,839
Rym: I saw four and five thousand dollars like jackets and bags, but not a seventeen thousand eight hundred dollar thing.

62
00:04:17,221 --> 00:04:19,511
Scott: All right, what would they sell in a ski place?

63
00:04:19,571 --> 00:04:22,403
Scott: but it's not a ski shop it's a gift shop Yeah, but it caught.

64
00:04:22,443 --> 00:04:26,040
Rym: it wasn't and it wasn't like a bag or a coat or anything like that.

65
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,221
Rym: Like.

66
00:04:26,261 --> 00:04:27,346
Rym: it wasn't an item of fashion.

67
00:04:27,828 --> 00:04:30,058
Rym: I'll keep this category real broad for your sake.

68
00:04:30,841 --> 00:04:35,015
Rym: I mean, it could be anything could be anything but it was seventeen thousand eight hundred dollars.

69
00:04:35,236 --> 00:04:36,360
Rym: The price is right.

70
00:04:36,665 --> 00:04:37,234
Scott: What cause?

71
00:04:37,254 --> 00:04:37,579
Scott: it's not.

72
00:04:39,281 --> 00:04:41,028
Scott: It's not some kind of ski equipment.

73
00:04:41,268 --> 00:04:41,810
Rym: It is not.

74
00:04:42,132 --> 00:04:44,280
Rym: I'll give you that one for free because I said it's not a ski shop.

75
00:04:44,933 --> 00:04:48,551
Rym: Yeah Can't do a Bob Barker voice.

76
00:04:48,772 --> 00:04:53,080
Rym: what could cost seventeen thousand eight hundred dollars at?

77
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,659
Scott: It doesn't sound like it was food.

78
00:04:56,041 --> 00:05:00,294
Scott: It was not food and it wouldn't be some sort of durable good because it's like.

79
00:05:00,816 --> 00:05:02,583
Scott: that would only be useful for someone who lives There.

80
00:05:02,603 --> 00:05:09,253
Scott: yeah, which is not a tourist item I'm just trying to think of like what you see in like New York touristy shops, right?

81
00:05:09,433 --> 00:05:09,734
Rym: Nothing.

82
00:05:09,794 --> 00:05:13,623
Rym: seventeen thousand eight hundred dollars You know.

83
00:05:13,663 --> 00:05:15,450
Scott: in New York touristy shops are.

84
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:20,612
Rym: I guess, you know, I Mean it could I like a car dealership.

85
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,220
Rym: There are seventeen thousand dollar cars.

86
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,174
Rym: You can see through the window of a car dealership, but that's a durable good.

87
00:05:25,214 --> 00:05:26,520
Scott: It's not gonna be a durable good.

88
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:30,123
Scott: Yeah, it'd be something in the Souvenir class.

89
00:05:30,424 --> 00:05:33,151
Rym: Yeah, and you would you would never guess we.

90
00:05:33,392 --> 00:05:37,967
Scott: we stood around like it like a watch would be obvious for 17,000 but it's probably not.

91
00:05:38,168 --> 00:05:42,564
Rym: we stood around that window as a group for a while Marveling at that.

92
00:05:42,584 --> 00:05:47,015
Scott: was it an artwork like an art gallery that it is adjacent to that.

93
00:05:47,035 --> 00:05:48,739
Rym: Oh, so you know what it was.

94
00:05:49,743 --> 00:05:54,640
Rym: Mmm, it was a dinosaur bone a full tibia a real one.

95
00:05:55,561 --> 00:05:57,851
Rym: What a gigantic real.

96
00:05:57,871 --> 00:05:58,755
Scott: that even legal.

97
00:05:59,036 --> 00:06:03,233
Rym: I don't know But to multiple of us tried to make the.

98
00:06:03,293 --> 00:06:07,860
Rym: that belongs in a museum reference Simultaneously and we stood around ridiculing it.

99
00:06:08,161 --> 00:06:09,104
Rym: It was part of a set.

100
00:06:09,445 --> 00:06:16,830
Rym: you could buy a bigger skeleton with multiple pieces for like to get there I don't know for like 80 or 90 thousand dollars.

101
00:06:16,991 --> 00:06:28,324
Rym: or you could buy just the tibia for $17,800 and it just do with it and it just put it in your house and I don't know hit someone with it Donate it to the.

102
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:32,240
Rym: I mean, I imagine you know people say they want a conversation piece in their house.

103
00:06:32,321 --> 00:06:39,472
Rym: I feel like if you had if you had this in your house Literally everyone who ever visited your house would immediately ask what the fuck is that?

104
00:06:40,074 --> 00:06:47,984
Scott: You know, it's a much better conversation piece a plaster replica of a dinosaur bone $1,800.

105
00:06:47,984 --> 00:06:48,866
Scott: people ask about.

106
00:06:49,027 --> 00:07:02,618
Scott: and then you being you know, that cool old uncle grandpa type character are like Yeah dinosaur bone like grandpa on it grandpa killed Exactly here, right and you know, you don't need the real dinosaur bone to do that.

107
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:12,860
Rym: So in the news, uh You may remember I think we had to have done a gig nights episode on whispers of the heart and the cat returns.

108
00:07:13,081 --> 00:07:15,007
Scott: I just assume I'm sure we did.

109
00:07:15,027 --> 00:07:17,054
Rym: Yep, so I didn't even know.

110
00:07:17,074 --> 00:07:21,280
Rym: this is apparently already coming out And somehow this just went off my radar.

111
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:24,200
Scott: I think we might have knew it existed, but I just wasn't interested at all.

112
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:28,460
Rym: I think we might have mentioned it on GeekNights when it was first announced and just never thought of it again.

113
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:33,253
Rym: But it's finally coming to theaters in LA and New York so we could see it.

114
00:07:33,293 --> 00:07:42,454
Rym: if we wanted the live action Sequel to whispers of the heart, which is not episodes that either one Rym must have deleted them before.

115
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,239
Rym: Oh, that's that's much easy.

116
00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:48,972
Scott: Wednesdays God, I remember like I'd have to rewatch cat returns.

117
00:07:49,012 --> 00:07:50,577
Scott: I've seen whisper the heart enough times.

118
00:07:50,617 --> 00:07:52,166
Scott: I don't need to rewatch funny I'm the opposite.

119
00:07:52,206 --> 00:08:02,014
Rym: I've seen cat returns a bunch of times But I would need to rewatch whispers of the heart to make sure I didn't miss anything poignant to talk about Because that movies got a lot of subtle character interactions going on.

120
00:08:02,717 --> 00:08:03,199
Scott: That's all it is.

121
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,439
Rym: Yeah, that movie is just hey, you want to watch a bunch of really subtle character growth over the course of an hour and change.

122
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,214
Rym: Okay, so it's airing.

123
00:08:12,274 --> 00:08:18,720
Rym: you can see it in theaters You live in a real city, but it's not the cat returns which is sort of a sequel to whispers of the heart.

124
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:24,840
Rym: It is just a sequel to whispers of the heart itself directly where it's not a remake of whisper of the heart.

125
00:08:25,001 --> 00:08:28,334
Rym: No, it is set ten years after whisper of the heart.

126
00:08:28,816 --> 00:08:32,424
Scott: and is Shizuku maybe say now my?

127
00:08:32,485 --> 00:08:38,566
Rym: in my my complete non-interest just changed to some interest and I watched the trailer and you know what it really is.

128
00:08:38,586 --> 00:08:53,480
Rym: it is just a typical Japanese live-action like love story where what between like a musician and a struggling novelist and It has only a tenuous link as far as I can tell to the original whispers of the heart anime.

129
00:08:53,882 --> 00:08:56,452
Scott: It's just my characters again returned to nothing.

130
00:08:56,472 --> 00:09:01,478
Scott: Yes ten years into the future Yeah, you have you gave me some interest and you dashed it away.

131
00:09:01,498 --> 00:09:04,891
Rym: Yep I was more interested until I watched the trailer and it just it.

132
00:09:05,614 --> 00:09:11,174
Rym: it did not look compelling to People like you and me in terms of the type of media.

133
00:09:11,254 --> 00:09:16,194
Rym: We would want to watch in the year 2023 is the way I would put it not saying it's bad.

134
00:09:16,335 --> 00:09:18,886
Rym: I don't think it's for us Mm-hmm.

135
00:09:19,471 --> 00:09:20,459
Rym: So, uh, yeah, what do you got?

136
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,760
Scott: Well in speaking of trailers that are compelling, right?

137
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:38,192
Scott: There was a movie that came out several years ago called Shin Godzilla Which was you know made directed by Anno the guy right and it was Maybe the best Godzilla movie.

138
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:39,540
Scott: It's way up there, right?

139
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,683
Scott: It's like it's.

140
00:09:40,783 --> 00:09:46,181
Scott: you know, and you know, he even brought in his little, you know Evangelion Tiffany's going on there right.

141
00:09:46,221 --> 00:09:48,210
Scott: if you haven't seen Shin Godzilla like what the fuck?

142
00:09:49,476 --> 00:09:50,047
Scott: Holy shit.

143
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:56,382
Scott: but that in We all know that Anno is a huge fan of Ultraman.

144
00:09:56,422 --> 00:09:58,329
Scott: That's like his favorite thing in the universe, right?

145
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:02,158
Scott: But he did not direct Shin Ultraman.

146
00:10:02,219 --> 00:10:11,106
Scott: He produced it and had someone else direct Shin Ultraman And the idea was obviously that much in the way that you know.

147
00:10:11,367 --> 00:10:18,610
Scott: Shin Godzilla Per you know made a new standalone Godzilla movie with a different sort of lens right filter on it.

148
00:10:19,951 --> 00:10:21,336
Scott: Shin Ultraman would do the same thing.

149
00:10:21,677 --> 00:10:24,104
Scott: make an Ultraman movie, you know.

150
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,132
Scott: a stat assumes that you know This.

151
00:10:26,514 --> 00:10:28,910
Scott: it's the only thing in the Ultraman universe, right?

152
00:10:29,491 --> 00:10:40,218
Scott: Yeah, but clearly sticks to the cannon and you know has lots of fan service for Ultraman fans just like the Godzilla one did and You know, but has that sort of aesthetic to it, right.

153
00:10:41,101 --> 00:10:56,345
Scott: and so this movie came out last year 20 summer 2022 Maybe I want to say took a long time to make apparently Yeah And I waited patiently for it to come out in the US legally and sure enough While Rym was I guess just about to go away.

154
00:10:56,365 --> 00:11:01,823
Scott: I think It played in the theater with subtitles in in the US.

155
00:11:02,164 --> 00:11:04,270
Rym: I was like I was gonna go see it.

156
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:08,170
Rym: I was in Germany at the time or like about to leave for Germany.

157
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:10,497
Scott: Anyway, I was wait.

158
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:14,352
Scott: I was really hyped up to see it because the trailer was Right.

159
00:11:14,533 --> 00:11:15,195
Scott: such a good trail.

160
00:11:15,215 --> 00:11:15,697
Scott: Yeah, right.

161
00:11:16,018 --> 00:11:23,910
Scott: It may even though I don't really know that much about Ultraman I just know the basics right and I don't have like emotional nostalgic attachment to it.

162
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:27,329
Scott: Yeah, I thought he always looked kind of weird and didn't look cool.

163
00:11:28,752 --> 00:11:31,489
Scott: You know, I was excited to see this cuz Shin Godzilla was so good.

164
00:11:32,712 --> 00:11:33,595
Scott: So I go to see it.

165
00:11:33,997 --> 00:11:36,647
Scott: and first of all, it's one of those fathom events right, which is fine.

166
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:43,318
Scott: and Secondly before the movie the movie was supposed to start at like 730.

167
00:11:43,318 --> 00:11:47,315
Scott: I think right now and They start doing that.

168
00:11:47,355 --> 00:11:52,230
Scott: They're promoting for some reason this like current Ultraman TV series.

169
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:52,731
Scott: That's gonna.

170
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,194
Scott: that's happening right now.

171
00:11:54,835 --> 00:12:05,670
Scott: that has like 500 different Ultraman in it you know and It's like I'm sitting there thinking like they're promoting this Ultraman show to the US audience.

172
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:08,079
Scott: I'm like, how many fans of this are there in the US.

173
00:12:08,119 --> 00:12:10,508
Rym: they make you watch something about all 500 Ultraman.

174
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:11,934
Rym: Is that what happened?

175
00:12:11,994 --> 00:12:15,450
Scott: Somebody's paying to dub this right and bring it out here.

176
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,336
Scott: I'm like how many people care about this, right?

177
00:12:17,698 --> 00:12:22,554
Scott: And so they do this trivia right for it and It's not true.

178
00:12:22,615 --> 00:12:24,000
Scott: It's like it's not it's trivia.

179
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,750
Scott: We're like you would have to be an Ultraman super nerd to know.

180
00:12:27,492 --> 00:12:33,913
Rym: No, it's like when we tried to run a version of challenger on fire at Katsucon and all the guests got the first one Wrong.

181
00:12:34,014 --> 00:12:35,042
Rym: and we're like, okay.

182
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:46,470
Scott: Oh Yeah And Like it's multiple choices four choices But all of them was like was it Ultraman Taiga or Ultraman Zeeborb or whatever?

183
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:48,138
Scott: It's like the fuck do I know?

184
00:12:48,319 --> 00:12:48,500
Scott: right?

185
00:12:48,821 --> 00:12:49,223
Scott: and so it.

186
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:53,630
Scott: finally, you know Everyone's getting pretty impatient because it's really slow trivia.

187
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:56,840
Scott: They get to the tenth question and we're like everyone's like.

188
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,225
Scott: this has to be the last one right?

189
00:12:58,285 --> 00:12:59,790
Scott: ten ten questions make sense.

190
00:13:00,372 --> 00:13:09,544
Scott: after the tenth question, there was an eleventh question and the entire theater groaned like So there were no Ultraman.

191
00:13:09,584 --> 00:13:09,927
Scott: so I'm like.

192
00:13:10,834 --> 00:13:18,469
Scott: the fact that everyone groaned simultaneously Really made me confirm like who is the audience for bringing?

193
00:13:19,491 --> 00:13:21,440
Scott: You know, we're there to see shin Ultraman.

194
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,249
Scott: None of us care about actual Ultraman.

195
00:13:24,792 --> 00:13:29,525
Scott: So the movie itself right in some ways was quite good right.

196
00:13:29,605 --> 00:13:32,904
Scott: the the action scenes Were you know?

197
00:13:34,131 --> 00:13:37,870
Scott: Had some of the corniness of the tokusatsu right to keep it authentic.

198
00:13:38,792 --> 00:13:51,270
Scott: But also like some pretty amazing like oh shit like he just did that kind of stuff going on Right, like, you know the kind of shit you see and say a studio trigger kind of anime, right?

199
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,849
Scott: Punching the earth kind of stuff.

200
00:13:54,891 --> 00:13:57,735
Scott: And also it's like Ultraman is an alien, right?

201
00:13:57,775 --> 00:13:58,416
Scott: That's his deal.

202
00:13:58,536 --> 00:13:59,658
Scott: He's not a robot, right?

203
00:13:59,698 --> 00:14:00,139
Scott: He's an alien.

204
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:26,060
Scott: and they did quite a good job of like making him seem alien and getting across that theme of like Ultraman being the person who sort of the go-between between humanity and Extraterrestrials right like he can understand both sides Right, but he the way he acts and moves is like, you know slightly inhuman, right?

205
00:14:27,081 --> 00:14:28,003
Scott: Uncanny Valley.

206
00:14:28,545 --> 00:14:44,665
Scott: and I think that really worked well because all like I said the estate what Ultraman looks like is kind of goofy right, but by making that goofiness and Keeping it and making it instead of goofiness be like alien this right it made it make sense Because

207
00:14:44,746 --> 00:14:51,880
Rym: I'm always a fan of Non-human characters like feeling viscerally inhuman and weird when you interact.

208
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,608
Scott: Yeah, so those are the good parts of the movie.

209
00:14:54,909 --> 00:14:58,440
Scott: The rest of the movie was not bad, but somewhat disappointing.

210
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:01,596
Scott: Sure, okay.

211
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,562
Scott: So the movie?

212
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:07,937
Scott: basically it feels like a bunch of Ultraman episodes like stuck together like end to end.

213
00:15:08,398 --> 00:15:11,470
Scott: and it's like it Like it's like each thing he fights.

214
00:15:11,591 --> 00:15:13,520
Scott: It's like, you know, it's like they took a TV episode.

215
00:15:14,401 --> 00:15:17,331
Scott: We're like they an alien a bad alien appears.

216
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:29,310
Scott: the humans figure out what to do about it Right, and then eventually there's an encounter right and they fight and Ultraman wins or loses and they then they do it again Repeatedly like four or five times.

217
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:42,439
Scott: I'd say I forget exactly how many and you know as it goes on the bad guys are getting stronger and more powerful and More serious and each one is sort of different in the way that they have to deal with it.

218
00:15:43,722 --> 00:15:54,647
Scott: But it's like some stuff is super rushed some stuff is you know drawn out It's you know, it wasn't that well Put together and I think a lot of it was.

219
00:15:54,667 --> 00:16:09,451
Scott: you know does have that problem where if you weren't already an Ultraman Superfan who knew a lot of things about Ultraman a lot of things just happen that have no meaning for you whatsoever Right now.

220
00:16:09,491 --> 00:16:15,526
Rym: that's something that better Movies of IPs that have that kind of fan who exists.

221
00:16:15,586 --> 00:16:16,930
Rym: do where like.

222
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:20,480
Rym: yeah, you'll get it and enjoy it without knowing that context.

223
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:25,258
Rym: But you'll enjoy more if you have that context, but it's not required to have that context.

224
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:25,900
Rym: It's a fine art.

225
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,689
Scott: I don't think it was required but it would.

226
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,740
Scott: it would have helped quite a bit, right?

227
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:36,895
Scott: It's like there's a lot of things that just like didn't have any Emotional and I think it felt like the movie they were supposed to.

228
00:16:36,915 --> 00:16:44,469
Scott: yeah you know, the other thing is the What's it called like Godzilla right?

229
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:56,557
Scott: First of all, Godzilla doesn't have that much lower Right and what it does have has never really been like, you know Can't like this, you know, Godzilla movies even old ones before shin Godzilla are all over the place.

230
00:16:56,597 --> 00:17:02,994
Scott: Yeah, right It's like they're not all right, but Ultraman has a more Consistent lore between all the Ultramans.

231
00:17:03,014 --> 00:17:03,880
Scott: I don't know if it's a hundred percent.

232
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,099
Rym: I imagine the fans care a lot about that lore the ones that they.

233
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:14,046
Scott: Because there was because Godzilla didn't have as much lures The shin Godzilla didn't have as much.

234
00:17:14,126 --> 00:17:19,339
Scott: but because Ultraman did shin Ultraman had more going on there, right?

235
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:28,404
Scott: it's like at one point like some other characters show up and it's like out of nowhere and I imagine if I had watched a bunch of Ultraman, I would have been like, oh shit That's who that is.

236
00:17:28,424 --> 00:17:30,655
Scott: All right, but it's like I didn't know who that was.

237
00:17:30,896 --> 00:17:40,639
Scott: Yeah But Anyway things of the day.

238
00:17:41,001 --> 00:17:41,744
Rym: so I don't really like.

239
00:17:41,784 --> 00:17:47,851
Rym: there's those YouTube shorts and There's not a lot of content in the YouTube shorts Like they.

240
00:17:47,931 --> 00:17:48,373
Rym: there's like.

241
00:17:48,393 --> 00:18:02,330
Scott: there's that one person in the YouTube shorts who does like the little comedy skits in like always in some kind of costume In the human body or a Noah's Ark or in history somewhere.

242
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:07,530
Rym: There's also the deadpan guy who has the little clips of like I pretended to be the city of LA on Facebook.

243
00:18:08,493 --> 00:18:15,590
Scott: No, but I'm telling the costume person They had they are churning out short videos like a machine like they have so many.

244
00:18:16,691 --> 00:18:25,870
Rym: so I scrolled down on the HTPC last night and We're gonna look for a YouTube video and I accidentally hit the shorts and they kind of just start auto playing.

245
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:31,430
Rym: But the one that auto played was actually really good and really funny and it is my thing of the day.

246
00:18:32,093 --> 00:18:33,881
Scott: Yeah, I had seen this one previously.

247
00:18:33,901 --> 00:18:35,990
Rym: Yeah, but it starts with the for the listener.

248
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:45,274
Rym: It starts with one of those tick-tock trends where someone like asks a question or gives you a prompt and you're supposed to put that at the front of your video and then you put your answer to the prompt.

249
00:18:45,735 --> 00:18:48,964
Rym: as the rest of the video and the prompt was the biggest lie.

250
00:18:48,984 --> 00:19:09,003
Rym: an adult told you that you later found out the truth and The response is a like 40 second song Where you see where it's going and it it's funny where it goes but the delivery of the reveal Pushes it up to about an 8 out of 10.

251
00:19:09,003 --> 00:19:12,312
Rym: Like I was laughing out loud Mm-hmm.

252
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:13,698
Rym: I'm not gonna spoil anything.

253
00:19:13,738 --> 00:19:15,887
Rym: It's a. it's a 59 second video.

254
00:19:15,908 --> 00:19:17,894
Rym: So I Don't know much more.

255
00:19:17,915 --> 00:19:19,529
Rym: I can say you should all watch this video.

256
00:19:20,113 --> 00:19:23,249
Scott: The person with the costumes by the way is Adrian bliss.

257
00:19:24,852 --> 00:19:27,388
Scott: Right and boy do they have a lot of short videos on here.

258
00:19:29,051 --> 00:19:30,977
Rym: Alright, so what do you got?

259
00:19:30,997 --> 00:19:32,080
Scott: Oh thing of the day wise?

260
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,244
Scott: Yeah.

261
00:19:33,324 --> 00:19:34,087
Scott: What did I have?

262
00:19:34,147 --> 00:19:39,745
Rym: Let me remember Brad Williams is the guy I was told not Brad Williams different Brad.

263
00:19:40,348 --> 00:19:40,670
Scott: All right.

264
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:43,678
Scott: So in the 70s, there was this artist.

265
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:45,723
Scott: their name was.

266
00:19:45,743 --> 00:19:47,026
Scott: the webpage is loading.

267
00:19:47,467 --> 00:19:51,025
Scott: I forget their name The concrete guy.

268
00:19:52,513 --> 00:19:56,902
Scott: Yeah, basically this dispersions art Wolf Vostell, right?

269
00:19:57,103 --> 00:20:05,029
Scott: I think they were Swiss They were an artist and their shtick was one of their sticks was encasing things in concrete, right?

270
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:12,740
Scott: you know one of their famous works was concrete traffic where they took like an old car and they encased the car in concrete.

271
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:19,780
Scott: and The car is in Chicago in a parking garage and you can see a picture of it in this in this article here.

272
00:20:21,051 --> 00:20:26,598
Scott: one of their other artworks was they took a book and encased it in concrete.

273
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:35,320
Scott: and that book is Right is in the Chicago University Library as a book, but if you just take it, it's just a slab of concrete.

274
00:20:36,283 --> 00:20:36,705
Scott: You don't know.

275
00:20:36,926 --> 00:20:39,559
Scott: and the question is is there a book in there?

276
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,532
Scott: Right, or is this just a rectangle like the car?

277
00:20:43,572 --> 00:20:43,934
Scott: It's like you.

278
00:20:44,296 --> 00:20:45,140
Scott: the car is in there.

279
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,569
Scott: You can see the wheels sticking out like.

280
00:20:46,811 --> 00:20:48,099
Scott: they know the car is in there.

281
00:20:48,923 --> 00:20:53,220
Scott: But the book could just be a rectangle of concrete and it's like, you know.

282
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:57,399
Scott: And if if it is a book that's in there, is it the book that they said was in there?

283
00:20:58,661 --> 00:21:00,450
Scott: Or is it a piece of paper?

284
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:01,153
Scott: No, it's in there.

285
00:21:01,173 --> 00:21:02,017
Rym: You know, what's in there?

286
00:21:02,037 --> 00:21:02,540
Rym: the Baron?

287
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:16,644
Scott: Yeah, so in this article they discuss right briefly What they are trying to do and what they have tried to do to determine if There's a book in there.

288
00:21:17,267 --> 00:21:18,050
Scott: What's in there?

289
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:19,475
Scott: What does it look like?

290
00:21:19,535 --> 00:21:20,780
Scott: What is it right without?

291
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,437
Scott: Breaking it open?

292
00:21:23,821 --> 00:21:28,740
Scott: Right because you don't want to ruin this somewhat famous and important artwork, right?

293
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,400
Rym: It looks like they found a rebar in there, which makes sense.

294
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,788
Rym: You can't just make a piece of concrete like that without a breaking.

295
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:34,751
Scott: Yep.

296
00:21:35,293 --> 00:21:37,440
Scott: So I think that's pretty pretty interesting.

297
00:21:37,601 --> 00:21:42,480
Rym: Yeah in the meta moment the GeekNights book club book was a leaf the unseen.

298
00:21:42,681 --> 00:21:45,954
Rym: It has been seen to the end next week on Thursday.

299
00:21:45,974 --> 00:21:47,379
Rym: We'll be doing a show on that.

300
00:21:47,942 --> 00:22:04,427
Rym: Also GeekNights will be live at PAX East 2023 on Thursday March 23rd at 2 30 p.m in the bumblebee theater with a panel that actually we've only ever done once and only like 100 people at magfest ever saw it.

301
00:22:04,809 --> 00:22:09,044
Rym: and we're probably gonna rewrite the whole thing because I was looking at the slides and I got A lot of thoughts already.

302
00:22:09,506 --> 00:22:15,116
Rym: can competitive and casual coexist in the same game Mm-hmm?

303
00:22:16,283 --> 00:22:17,086
Rym: So yeah, that'll be fun.

304
00:22:17,287 --> 00:22:20,197
Scott: It might be possible, but it's rarely accomplished.

305
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:27,479
Rym: and yeah I feel like it might actually be impossible without there being a wall between the games that make them different.

306
00:22:27,499 --> 00:22:30,587
Rym: games Could be but we'll see.

307
00:22:30,848 --> 00:22:32,172
Rym: do we know the answer to that question?

308
00:22:32,332 --> 00:22:34,218
Rym: No, we still have to finish writing the panel.

309
00:22:34,278 --> 00:22:38,400
Rym: So Otherwise, uh join the GeekNights forum.

310
00:22:38,842 --> 00:22:48,880
Rym: You might have noticed stop you stopped using Twitter quite some time ago, but bit by bit I see you appearing in my Mastodon, which is actually just a republish of my microblog.

311
00:22:50,523 --> 00:23:04,180
Scott: I'm working on creating a new Internet life system and you know We're gonna take our time with it and make sure we get it right because I want to make something that will last The rest of my days so I don't have to put up with this ever again

312
00:23:04,702 --> 00:23:05,023
Rym: And I'm

313
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:10,926
Scott: at least last the rest of my days as long as HTTP lasts the rest of my days Which I presume it will and

314
00:23:10,966 --> 00:23:13,998
Rym: I'm keeping an eye on Scott does because my solution is yeah.

315
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,848
Scott: I mean whatever I make will be you could use it.

316
00:23:17,149 --> 00:23:23,940
Rym: Yeah, and I imagine you and I have very similar Desires about how to engage with the internet in most ways.

317
00:23:24,061 --> 00:23:29,360
Rym: So I feel like whatever you build will end up being better than what I'm doing Which is I didn't want to write any code.

318
00:23:29,442 --> 00:23:29,919
Rym: I was lazy.

319
00:23:30,061 --> 00:23:34,038
Rym: So I basically bought some hosting and cobbled three or four services together to me.

320
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:39,036
Scott: I don't think it'll be like the only way that what I make will be better than what you know is.

321
00:23:39,056 --> 00:23:45,547
Scott: if you know It becomes like a company and a bunch of people work on it, which is there's no way You know, it's like that.

322
00:23:45,648 --> 00:23:50,689
Scott: I can make something that is all those features Right of like an actual other product.

323
00:23:51,212 --> 00:23:52,296
Rym: I have two superpowers.

324
00:23:52,437 --> 00:23:58,840
Rym: I am a Legit professional product manager and I am really good at convincing people to do things that might not be in their best interest.

325
00:23:59,162 --> 00:24:00,829
Rym: We could probably get some people to start working on it.

326
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:04,248
Scott: If you had the cord on we can't even finish our own website Which is what I'm doing first.

327
00:24:04,288 --> 00:24:06,160
Rym: Should I should I evenly try to convince people?

328
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,896
Rym: It'd be really cool to work on the website with you.

329
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:13,874
Scott: The main thing really the only hard yell right the actual import of our day, right?

330
00:24:14,295 --> 00:24:14,496
Scott: We've.

331
00:24:14,556 --> 00:24:21,440
Scott: I've already imported the news I'm working on importing the book clubs and then I got to import the actual episodes and then that's most of it.

332
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:30,367
Scott: But then there's a bunch of tidying up and then there's the real nerd That is that stands for extract Transform and load.

333
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:33,100
Scott: it is not even that much data on our cart website.

334
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:35,240
Scott: It's only like, you know a few thousand records.

335
00:24:35,366 --> 00:24:46,378
Rym: Yeah but it's the the sheer amount of pain in the ass it actually takes compared to the pain in the ass that a naive person who is not a software person expects it to take.

336
00:24:46,901 --> 00:24:53,165
Rym: When you have a bunch of data in something and all you want to do is move that data into something else That isn't the same thing.

337
00:24:53,547 --> 00:24:56,540
Rym: You might think that like you might expect that to be a certain amount of pain.

338
00:24:57,185 --> 00:25:08,639
Rym: It is such a pain in the ass that there are Hundreds and hundreds of companies whose sole job is to do this for you for extremely large amounts of money And those companies make tons of money.

339
00:25:09,262 --> 00:25:16,480
Scott: It might honestly be faster with only a thousand something episodes to like, you know Do a really crappy ETL then clean it up by hand.

340
00:25:16,881 --> 00:25:24,980
Rym: I was actually gonna possibly suggest that kind of like how it's sometimes cheaper to just fill a UPS truck with Hard drives that it is to send data over a pipe.

341
00:25:25,821 --> 00:25:32,600
Scott: Yeah, it's like I'm writing a whole thing to get like the episode numbers, you know, the forum links, correct, right?

342
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:39,199
Scott: It's like what if you just sat there and like went to each episode and found the forum post and pasted the link.

343
00:25:39,259 --> 00:25:47,718
Scott: Yeah So because this only has to be done once like I'm writing code To do a thing that only that code will run once and be thrown out.

344
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:55,400
Rym: Yep It's not like we're making a pipeline to be able to regularly and repeatably Take a GeekNights podcast websites and import them into our new website.

345
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:56,722
Scott: Exactly.

346
00:25:56,783 --> 00:25:59,696
Scott: It's writing all this code to do a thing one time.

347
00:25:59,797 --> 00:26:04,840
Scott: It's like Where's all the other code that's much easier to write is code that will run every single time.

348
00:26:04,941 --> 00:26:06,813
Scott: So it visits the website every single time.

349
00:26:06,873 --> 00:26:07,920
Scott: Rym makes a new episode.

350
00:26:08,843 --> 00:26:09,855
Scott: That's much more important.

351
00:26:09,916 --> 00:26:12,264
Rym: Yep All right.

352
00:26:12,546 --> 00:26:19,240
Rym: So main bid we ended up going because our friend cat Reminded us this was happening and got all of us tickets.

353
00:26:20,326 --> 00:26:41,120
Rym: We went to see Ramayana the Legend of Prince Rama which has been described by people who don't pay that much attention as the Ghibli Ramayana, which is a tangentially Somewhat true in that a number of animators who went on to form and work in Studio Ghibli worked on this movie.

354
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,726
Rym: But it is not a Ghibli movie.

355
00:26:43,348 --> 00:26:46,700
Scott: No, the Ghibli Totoro does not appear at the beginning of this film.

356
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:51,677
Scott: So the deal I didn't know this existed before he went to see it and I did some minor research.

357
00:26:51,737 --> 00:26:56,780
Rym: if I if I knew it Existed I feel like Mike tool told me it existed and I just forgot.

358
00:26:57,222 --> 00:26:58,348
Scott: Well, it's it's on it.

359
00:26:58,368 --> 00:27:00,740
Scott: You can watch it all on YouTube in low resolution.

360
00:27:00,921 --> 00:27:03,794
Rym: I mean, this is this anime is in the genre of anime.

361
00:27:03,814 --> 00:27:05,180
Rym: Mike tool will tell you about.

362
00:27:05,742 --> 00:27:08,353
Scott: Yeah, if you look for it on YouTube, it's there and low res.

363
00:27:08,374 --> 00:27:09,338
Scott: maybe Rym could link to that.

364
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:21,437
Scott: in the episode We saw a 4k digital rescan remaster of the movie Which had the same audio track as the YouTube one, but that was not the original audio track.

365
00:27:21,497 --> 00:27:21,718
Scott: It's a.

366
00:27:21,798 --> 00:27:31,082
Rym: it's an English dub Yep, and it was only screened once and apparently there is no legal way to show it anywhere in the United States.

367
00:27:31,203 --> 00:27:34,778
Scott: it was screened twice once before and then once when we saw it.

368
00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:38,629
Rym: All right, so Screening they can do in the modern era I guess right.

369
00:27:38,669 --> 00:27:43,385
Scott: the the original one could be seen all over the place I guess at certain times, right?

370
00:27:43,605 --> 00:27:48,680
Scott: Yeah before k1 in the US has not been fully licensed distributed, etc.

371
00:27:49,041 --> 00:27:54,225
Scott: But in other places it may have already been and you know Depending on where you are in the world.

372
00:27:54,566 --> 00:27:58,439
Scott: You might be able to see the 4k version we saw in who knows what language.

373
00:27:59,461 --> 00:28:07,486
Rym: Anyway, yep, and it was what the hell is available in parts of India at some points and not at other points and never in Some other parts of India.

374
00:28:07,506 --> 00:28:21,079
Rym: There's a. there's a. it is one of those movies Where if you go to the Wikipedia page just to give you context you'll get a brief one paragraph explaining it a list of the Cast one paragraph about the production and then an entire section titled controversies.

375
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:40,730
Scott: So what I know about it is you know, the the brief research I did yeah I was like reading a couple things is that they you know There was one of those cultural partnership things right that like every country loves to do except the United States because the United States You know as very has the superiority complex.

376
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:43,400
Scott: so they think other countries are other countries, right?

377
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:49,480
Scott: whereas other countries Think of themselves as equals to other countries or at least that's the way it appears to me.

378
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,225
Scott: Yeah, right.

379
00:28:50,527 --> 00:28:57,493
Scott: and so you'll have partnerships like oh so and so cultural exchange between European country and African country.

380
00:28:57,533 --> 00:29:00,924
Scott: and they do it the thing and make an artwork and have an Event.

381
00:29:00,984 --> 00:29:08,194
Scott: and you know, so Japan does these a lot And what they like, you know, we talked about flying go ship on GeekNights.

382
00:29:08,235 --> 00:29:09,540
Scott: that was a Japan Russian deal.

383
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:14,079
Scott: Yeah, I don't know if it's a cultural exchange deal, but it was an international, you know thing.

384
00:29:14,983 --> 00:29:17,357
Scott: We've seen a lot of Japan France action going on.

385
00:29:17,437 --> 00:29:21,533
Rym: Oh, yeah Countries love it that love the comic book and love the animation.

386
00:29:22,296 --> 00:29:30,260
Scott: Yep, but This is Japan India to celebrate their many years of you know, friendship, right?

387
00:29:31,081 --> 00:29:34,373
Scott: Someone got a bunch of money from some where who knows.

388
00:29:34,594 --> 00:29:36,300
Rym: so there's I. I know more of this story.

389
00:29:36,421 --> 00:29:40,720
Rym: So the guy who put this all together Was you go Sacco?

390
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,487
Rym: This was the guy and he was in.

391
00:29:43,507 --> 00:29:56,596
Rym: he went to India and he was making a documentary in India for the Japanese audience about the Archaeological excavation of some place that's relevant to the real Ramayana.

392
00:29:56,816 --> 00:29:57,940
Rym: Like that's what was going on.

393
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:01,670
Rym: All right According to Wikipedia and some other.

394
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:06,247
Rym: I found some other articles that all just say the same thing But I couldn't find a ton of reporting on this.

395
00:30:06,327 --> 00:30:07,049
Rym: So I'm going on.

396
00:30:07,591 --> 00:30:29,700
Rym: I'm going on like four sources that are all kind of circular in the 80s While this was going on Nationalist newspaper in India Sort of mischaracterized the work he was doing and said, oh, he's not making a documentary He's making of an animated version of the Ramayana like that.

397
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,484
Rym: you can't do that.

398
00:30:30,685 --> 00:30:37,817
Rym: and the Nationalist got really mad about it and It seems like his response was well, I'm not making that but that's a good idea.

399
00:30:41,141 --> 00:30:53,619
Rym: So he got people together and got some money and they went to the Indian government and the Indian government actually was very on board until it suddenly wasn't because the Nationalist got extremely mad about this.

400
00:30:53,639 --> 00:31:03,740
Rym: and Eventually the Indian or agency the Indian government agency that was working with this studio and Japan backed out and said yeah We're not gonna help anymore.

401
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:08,217
Rym: But the studio continued over a decade to finish the movie and they had.

402
00:31:08,277 --> 00:31:09,060
Scott: I took them a decade.

403
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:13,779
Scott: They worked on this in the early 80s like and it took them to like a decade to finish this.

404
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:22,665
Rym: Yeah, but they did employ a large number of Indian animators who wanted to work on the project Despite the Indian government not wanting it to proceed.

405
00:31:22,685 --> 00:31:30,297
Rym: and it seems like this was all sort of Extra complicated because there was an incident that I don't know a lot about.

406
00:31:31,403 --> 00:31:32,773
Scott: You just read about it in Wikipedia.

407
00:31:32,813 --> 00:31:33,155
Scott: That's it.

408
00:31:33,216 --> 00:31:47,220
Rym: Well, I remember Someone typing in whatever the IOG a dispute which I remember hearing about at RIT actually in a politics class and That was the only time I'd ever heard of it because it's a relatively recent dispute.

409
00:31:47,701 --> 00:32:03,686
Rym: It's very similar to his disputes around Jerusalem and while that dispute was ongoing the Indian government basically was like, yeah We're not gonna say shit about Ramayana at any point in any capacity in public because we're gonna piss somebody off no matter what and we really want this problem To die down.

410
00:32:04,069 --> 00:32:12,539
Rym: so there are big cultural controversies around the creation and existence of this movie and those seem to be a big part of why it.

411
00:32:13,261 --> 00:32:16,120
Rym: There aren't really rights to screen it in most places.

412
00:32:16,923 --> 00:32:20,720
Scott: Well, somebody put the effort into 4k remaster it when they did a great job visually

413
00:32:20,861 --> 00:32:37,051
Rym: yeah, and it looks like the intent is to release it again and have screenings of it because the Interesting thing is from everything I can gather There was an era in India where it was just shown in theaters and kids who saw it in theaters They fucking remember it.

414
00:32:37,112 --> 00:32:38,860
Rym: That's like all the Ramayana movie.

415
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,045
Rym: We all saw that like.

416
00:32:40,306 --> 00:32:43,720
Rym: a lot of people know about it and it is very well known outside of the US.

417
00:32:44,681 --> 00:32:47,158
Scott: Hmm so what the hell is this movie like?

418
00:32:47,238 --> 00:32:58,260
Scott: well You can sort of tell when you're watching it that it was made over the course of ten years because the early parts of the Film I mean, I know they don't usually animate films like from beginning to end.

419
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:03,520
Scott: Oh, but this one seems like they really animated it from beginning to end really feels like in order.

420
00:33:03,701 --> 00:33:05,732
Rym: They animated the park as the beginning.

421
00:33:05,812 --> 00:33:22,048
Rym: like every scene in the beginning It's really long by the way is like, you know those Christian animations Or like Patriotic animations they make in America that kids something that Ned Flanders would show his kids exactly Where it's like a minimum effort.

422
00:33:22,108 --> 00:33:28,070
Rym: like all the characters from the important historical thing are on screen And they all say the right things that up.

423
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:29,416
Rym: that canonically happened.

424
00:33:29,737 --> 00:33:36,509
Rym: and the narrative And then Jesus went to Nazareth it narrator.

425
00:33:36,732 --> 00:33:46,854
Rym: it's like strictly adhering to the most common reading of the Ramayana that would be known in India like very strictly and it's just this scene happens.

426
00:33:46,894 --> 00:33:52,526
Rym: then this scene happens then this scene happens and Then it kind of goes off the rails About a third.

427
00:33:53,048 --> 00:34:02,660
Scott: So first of all, right, so the the Animation quality right in the early parts of the movie is not awful, right?

428
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,112
Scott: Yeah, but it's also not like amazing.

429
00:34:05,172 --> 00:34:13,134
Rym: or the characters stay Remarkably on model from don't think But they don't move around a lot in the first third of the movie.

430
00:34:13,154 --> 00:34:14,199
Rym: They kind of just stand there.

431
00:34:14,862 --> 00:34:20,500
Scott: Yeah, so and you can tell like it feels like that's the part they must have animated in the 80s or maybe it right.

432
00:34:20,681 --> 00:34:21,362
Scott: I feel

433
00:34:21,402 --> 00:34:26,360
Rym: like the turning point between the Indian government's on board and the Indian government is not on board

434
00:34:26,801 --> 00:34:27,303
Scott: Probably

435
00:34:27,342 --> 00:34:32,080
Rym: coincides with this is a strict retelling - now there's not there's jets

436
00:34:33,022 --> 00:34:37,473
Scott: Right, so then towards the end of the movie there's a battle right like a giant war.

437
00:34:37,592 --> 00:34:47,040
Scott: and it's like, you know in that part You can sort of absolutely tell that it was animated by people with Studio Ghibli experience.

438
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:54,770
Scott: Yeah, you know cuz clearly you're see that just the style the way things move the you know the it's like.

439
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:57,685
Scott: you can just tell right away the like.

440
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:08,359
Rym: if someone animated a Really long level in dynasty warriors with Studio Ghibli level skills like that is where in style that is what it feels like.

441
00:35:09,342 --> 00:35:16,987
Scott: Yeah, like it's you it's immediately apparent that the Studio Ghibli and just it's the animation towards the end there Especially in the 4k.

442
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:20,835
Scott: like it doesn't come across on YouTube at all But it's like in the 4k one.

443
00:35:21,541 --> 00:35:26,438
Scott: It was actually quite unbelievable the the cell animation going on towards the end of this movie.

444
00:35:26,478 --> 00:35:29,622
Rym: Yep And if you're not story the Ramayana It's.

445
00:35:30,164 --> 00:35:36,700
Rym: it is very I'd say it's analogous to the the story of the Trojan War If you're someone who would know about one and not the other.

446
00:35:37,661 --> 00:35:41,772
Scott: hmm But you know, it's a. it's not that exciting a story.

447
00:35:41,812 --> 00:35:43,377
Scott: It's a rescue the princess kind of deal.

448
00:35:43,417 --> 00:35:44,964
Rym: Yep, right Yeah, it's.

449
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:45,689
Rym: I mean the.

450
00:35:45,749 --> 00:36:23,552
Rym: the vague gist of the Ramayana Which is there are like radically different versions of it out there and even different versions in different countries near India But the one as portrayed in this anime it seems that lines up with the one that I know Best ish from like a middle school and it's basically you've got a really good King and there's a neighboring kingdom That is run by demons and demon people But that someone in the good Kings court Convinces one of his wives to do a really shady thing for no reason and forces the king to Basically exile his best smartest most perfect son to the

451
00:36:23,592 --> 00:36:23,752
Scott: wood.

452
00:36:23,792 --> 00:36:26,420
Rym: everyone love everyone loves Rama his perfect son.

453
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:31,400
Scott: Also everyone in the good kingdom is good and smart except for that one person who convinced the king.

454
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,048
Rym: The king is like everyone like.

455
00:36:33,068 --> 00:36:35,460
Rym: I don't want to do this, but I'm standing by my word.

456
00:36:35,845 --> 00:36:46,627
Rym: Rama is like look I know you don't want to do it but I'm gonna do exactly what the law says because I am also perfect and good and the whole kingdom is weeping and everyone everyone Agrees, everyone's perfect and good.

457
00:36:46,707 --> 00:37:01,759
Rym: everyone agrees this sucks, but we got to do it yep, and then a demon steals his wife from the woods and then the Trojan War starts and the entire rest of the story is the war to What do they call it at the end of the movie?

458
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,759
Rym: Thus was the tale of the avoidable war.

459
00:37:05,801 --> 00:37:07,306
Scott: Yeah, very avoidable war.

460
00:37:07,406 --> 00:37:11,962
Scott: but the thing is the hero of the movie is supposed to be Rama the guy whose name is in The title.

461
00:37:12,102 --> 00:37:14,795
Scott: Yeah, and he is to some extent.

462
00:37:14,835 --> 00:37:18,469
Scott: but the real hero is He on his way to the war.

463
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:21,600
Scott: his army is not an army of people from his country.

464
00:37:21,881 --> 00:37:23,828
Scott: The army is the monkey kingdom.

465
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:27,280
Rym: Yeah, Hanuman is doing all the fucking work here.

466
00:37:28,103 --> 00:37:33,664
Scott: one of the monkeys is magical and can grow giant and That's the real hero.

467
00:37:33,724 --> 00:37:36,111
Scott: He's due each carrying the whole load, right?

468
00:37:36,251 --> 00:37:38,558
Scott: It's like, you know Rama just like steps in.

469
00:37:38,598 --> 00:37:39,080
Scott: at the end.

470
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,600
Scott: It's like the the giant monkey did all the real.

471
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:48,156
Scott: Okay But yeah, so that's that the story is not that compelling right.

472
00:37:49,019 --> 00:37:57,740
Scott: the Audio track that we heard which is the one you'll hear on YouTube is a really bad Not the worst but pretty bad.

473
00:37:58,464 --> 00:38:01,217
Rym: English English charitable, you know what it sounds like.

474
00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:13,000
Rym: it Reminds me of the music they put in the dub of Dominion tank police instead of the original music Like it's very synthy and very simple like it kind of sounds like it was made on a Casio keyboard.

475
00:38:13,382 --> 00:38:24,260
Rym: Like the act the acting is bad, you know, yeah You know who's acting was good though the evil king that that character's voice Was actually pretty a plus a bet better than the other character.

476
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:24,923
Rym: Yeah, he was.

477
00:38:25,064 --> 00:38:28,060
Rym: he would have been fine and cowboy bebop as an English dub actor.

478
00:38:29,001 --> 00:38:41,140
Scott: right, but the music what happens is in the movie there are a few scenes where there is songs and During those song parts you can sort what I'm guessing because that's the way it sounds.

479
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:48,160
Scott: It sounds like they cut away from the English dub and played the original, you know is a Hindi language.

480
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,377
Scott: I'm assuming right track and that sounds.

481
00:38:51,699 --> 00:38:56,616
Scott: you know The audio quality is low because it's some old audio track from the 80s or 90s, right?

482
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:03,643
Scott: But it still sounds incredible compared to the English dub You were just listening to.

483
00:39:03,904 --> 00:39:09,020
Scott: right and I would really love to watch the whole thing with that audio track and subtitles.

484
00:39:09,242 --> 00:39:10,940
Scott: I think that would be very nice.

485
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,945
Rym: But what is the rest of this movie like like basically.

486
00:39:13,126 --> 00:39:31,099
Rym: after that very relatively short initial setup the war starts and it's basically Just Rama and his army fight a dangerous entity then they fight the even more dangerous guy Then they fight the mini-boss then they fight the boss then they fight the square boss then there's jet fighters then it's over.

487
00:39:32,361 --> 00:39:35,129
Scott: The jet fighter is the the square bosses first.

488
00:39:35,169 --> 00:39:38,920
Rym: Yeah, the square boss ends up having multiple forms one of which is a fighter jet.

489
00:39:39,921 --> 00:39:44,234
Scott: right, but yeah, it's like During these battles, right?

490
00:39:44,314 --> 00:39:47,447
Scott: It's like amazing Like shit happens.

491
00:39:47,487 --> 00:39:50,718
Scott: that is like very audience pleased and everyone's very different.

492
00:39:50,878 --> 00:39:59,260
Rym: almost to the point It feels like a different Animator was in charge of like each fight scene because every one of them has a very distinctive style and they're all pretty different.

493
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:02,068
Scott: Right like the it sort of begins.

494
00:40:02,209 --> 00:40:05,940
Scott: actually they're the demon kingdom is on an island and they have to get to the island.

495
00:40:06,421 --> 00:40:12,220
Scott: So like the first thing that's amazing is like they build a stone bridge to get to the the island.

496
00:40:12,386 --> 00:40:12,758
Scott: Oh, right.

497
00:40:13,241 --> 00:40:23,793
Scott: and it's like that scene is just like a super well animated scene and you could tell like Ghibli's throwing in a lot of Environmental stuff in there, you know, it's like it's real good.

498
00:40:23,813 --> 00:40:24,775
Scott: You know, there's just.

499
00:40:25,518 --> 00:40:32,573
Scott: they're not even talking They're just animating these monkeys building a bridge Out of magical floating stones and it's awesome, right.

500
00:40:33,115 --> 00:40:39,938
Scott: then they get there, you know They have a regular fight with you know, some dudes right, you know, just and then it really happens.

501
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:40,340
Scott: is you know?

502
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,564
Scott: There's some injuries that happen.

503
00:40:42,125 --> 00:40:43,148
Scott: So they need healing.

504
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:45,997
Scott: but the healing herbs on the demon land don't work.

505
00:40:46,759 --> 00:40:51,780
Scott: So They find out somehow I forget that they have to get healing herbs from the Himalayas.

506
00:40:52,801 --> 00:40:55,532
Rym: So Hanuman just flies there and brings the Himalayas the giant.

507
00:40:55,592 --> 00:40:57,480
Scott: the giant monkey can also fly.

508
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:00,633
Scott: Well the shape the size-changing monkey can also fly.

509
00:41:00,653 --> 00:41:02,400
Rym: you get the scene where they unlock his power.

510
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:06,794
Rym: They're like look we your powers were locked away cuz we didn't want you to fuck around.

511
00:41:06,874 --> 00:41:08,580
Rym: so you can have all your power now.

512
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:09,338
Rym: Don't go too nuts.

513
00:41:10,322 --> 00:41:12,319
Scott: Yeah, he flies to the Himalayas.

514
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:19,520
Scott: He finds the herbs right and he's like how am I gonna get all these herbs back to the the battlefield and the demon?

515
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:20,322
Scott: Island?

516
00:41:20,966 --> 00:41:25,785
Scott: he picks up the whole mountain And carries it.

517
00:41:26,267 --> 00:41:27,491
Scott: it's um, it's incredible.

518
00:41:27,572 --> 00:41:33,470
Scott: it's like oh shit he picked up the whole Right and it basically carries on like that.

519
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:35,660
Scott: It's like what he brings the whole mountain there.

520
00:41:35,901 --> 00:41:39,520
Scott: They actually show him bring you back at the end of the movie out to put it back where it belongs.

521
00:41:39,661 --> 00:41:41,150
Scott: It's like, you know, they does.

522
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:42,880
Scott: he has to fight another giant.

523
00:41:43,301 --> 00:41:43,803
Scott: They have to.

524
00:41:43,863 --> 00:41:54,993
Scott: there's like these giant monkey war machines at one point only in that one scene, but they're so good Right, and then there's like that when the final demon King comes out.

525
00:41:55,073 --> 00:42:01,246
Scott: it's like his first form is like there's no Chekhov's like Lee, you know Tinting that this exists.

526
00:42:01,547 --> 00:42:07,447
Scott: He just comes out in a fighter jet shooting like grenade arrows Right and electrified weeks.

527
00:42:07,708 --> 00:42:13,302
Rym: a lot of the later parts of the fight scenes reek of the animators in Japan being like, you know What'd be cool?

528
00:42:13,583 --> 00:42:16,573
Rym: Let's interpret this magical stuff as technology.

529
00:42:16,653 --> 00:42:17,256
Rym: I'm gonna do this.

530
00:42:17,316 --> 00:42:18,580
Rym: I want to animate technology.

531
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:19,571
Rym: I want to animate a month.

532
00:42:19,591 --> 00:42:19,895
Scott: That's right.

533
00:42:21,864 --> 00:42:23,215
Scott: Yep, I want to animate a fighter jet.

534
00:42:23,255 --> 00:42:23,659
Scott: Let's do it.

535
00:42:24,822 --> 00:42:29,640
Scott: He comes out they fucking he gets his head just chopped off right on screen and another head starts growing.

536
00:42:29,962 --> 00:42:32,817
Rym: I think they cut off and a third one starts making its way up.

537
00:42:33,721 --> 00:42:38,778
Scott: Yeah, then he becomes really enormous and has a bunch of heads and then it's a fist of the North Star situation.

538
00:42:38,838 --> 00:42:44,860
Scott: little guy for his Big guy, it's like it gets really off the hook in the battle and it's it's fun.

539
00:42:45,201 --> 00:42:54,424
Scott: It's a lot of fun seeing this amazing animation with these ridiculous awesome scenes going on but otherwise It's really long.

540
00:42:54,464 --> 00:42:56,328
Rym: Yeah, so can I long?

541
00:42:56,369 --> 00:43:04,039
Rym: writing in variety in 1993 said quote the film is Relentlessly paced and has no heart.

542
00:43:05,585 --> 00:43:06,694
Scott: It definitely has no heart.

543
00:43:06,836 --> 00:43:08,364
Scott: That's true It's.

544
00:43:08,424 --> 00:43:16,300
Scott: the only heart is the heart that those animators put in to those You know battle scenes towards the end where they were having fun with it, right?

545
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:18,400
Scott: There's no other heart anywhere else to be found.

546
00:43:18,461 --> 00:43:26,316
Rym: I gotta say though if I was a kid Like cuz I went to Catholic school when I was young and they put in one of those Ned Flanders tapes and a third of The way through it turned into this.

547
00:43:27,583 --> 00:43:28,836
Scott: That would be a lot more attention.

548
00:43:32,621 --> 00:43:40,531
Rym: My favorite bit is the one story the one brother of the king who is I think is a brother the giant guy Who's asleep and halfway through the fighting?

549
00:43:40,552 --> 00:43:42,220
Rym: They're like, oh the war is not going so well.

550
00:43:42,601 --> 00:43:43,544
Rym: Should we wake up her brother?

551
00:43:43,564 --> 00:43:47,417
Rym: and they're like, ah, we could but he's so close to achieving immortality.

552
00:43:47,497 --> 00:43:48,380
Rym: Let him sleep longer.

553
00:43:48,902 --> 00:43:52,256
Scott: So they kind of story is this this giant dude who's actually?

554
00:43:52,276 --> 00:43:53,240
Scott: he's a demon?

555
00:43:53,320 --> 00:44:00,840
Scott: He's on the demons side or the demon kingdom, but he's not a bad guy right and all his sons aren't bad people either.

556
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:04,234
Scott: They're just in the demon kingdom fighting for the demon kingdom, right?

557
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:05,620
Scott: You see that trope a lot, right?

558
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:11,418
Scott: It's like the guy who you know, you know is he's lives in the bad country, right?

559
00:44:12,342 --> 00:44:14,591
Scott: But he's you know, is he bad?

560
00:44:14,611 --> 00:44:16,218
Scott: It's a good example.

561
00:44:16,298 --> 00:44:19,327
Scott: Gundam What Romborall is like?

562
00:44:19,347 --> 00:44:22,100
Scott: Yeah, he fights for Zeon, right?

563
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:27,196
Scott: But he's like a good dude and Eve even when the good guys beat him.

564
00:44:27,397 --> 00:44:32,520
Scott: They're sad Like the character who supports honorable guy who was on the wrong?

565
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:41,251
Rym: Or the one who ends up supporting evil but still has a sense of honor like that's a trope in a lot of media Right, so that's what is this giant and his kids?

566
00:44:41,351 --> 00:44:42,536
Scott: are that right there?

567
00:44:42,556 --> 00:44:43,560
Scott: the on the bad team?

568
00:44:43,662 --> 00:44:56,504
Scott: They are bad But they have honor and what you get to see it like all the little giant dude is Sleeping and if he can sleep without waking up for what six or seven years, he will become Immortal, right?

569
00:44:57,166 --> 00:45:01,078
Scott: So once Rama starts causing trouble the demons like try to wake him up.

570
00:45:01,118 --> 00:45:05,799
Scott: They're like, oh shit We might need the giant guy to help win this fight and they blow some horns in his ear.

571
00:45:06,562 --> 00:45:06,884
Scott: It's like.

572
00:45:07,365 --> 00:45:07,626
Scott: it's like.

573
00:45:07,988 --> 00:45:08,951
Scott: it's like it's not working.

574
00:45:08,972 --> 00:45:11,220
Scott: It's like alright, maybe we'll just let him become immortal.

575
00:45:11,321 --> 00:45:13,113
Scott: Let's see if we can handle it right without him.

576
00:45:13,154 --> 00:45:13,718
Scott: Yeah, they can't.

577
00:45:14,221 --> 00:45:15,726
Rym: They come back like an hour later.

578
00:45:15,767 --> 00:45:18,075
Scott: Yeah shit gets dire and they're like, oh crap.

579
00:45:18,095 --> 00:45:19,855
Scott: We really do have to wake him up We're losing.

580
00:45:21,902 --> 00:45:27,160
Rym: They like have elephants knock him over and they dump like a mountains worth of water on it.

581
00:45:27,822 --> 00:45:32,320
Scott: They put it they put a bowl next to his head and I'm like, oh are they gonna put his hand to make him pee?

582
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:40,520
Scott: If he pees they'll be a flood PBF Right, but no they have a whole army of elephants.

583
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,234
Scott: Roll them over into into the water so that he'll wake up.

584
00:45:45,294 --> 00:45:45,676
Rym: He's animated.

585
00:45:47,541 --> 00:45:49,790
Rym: He's just like son of a bitch.

586
00:45:49,991 --> 00:45:50,915
Rym: All right, whatever.

587
00:45:51,036 --> 00:45:51,940
Rym: I'll go take care of it.

588
00:45:52,261 --> 00:45:52,763
Rym: And he's like.

589
00:45:52,783 --> 00:45:53,064
Scott: he's like.

590
00:45:53,104 --> 00:45:56,820
Scott: I'm pissed that you woke me up and I didn't achieve immortality, but I'm up now.

591
00:45:57,282 --> 00:46:04,000
Scott: So I might as well get this over with before I start sleep Yeah, and he's perfectly polite before he starts fighting with Rama's army.

592
00:46:05,449 --> 00:46:07,042
Scott: Yeah It's.

593
00:46:07,263 --> 00:46:08,672
Rym: uh, I don't know this.

594
00:46:08,712 --> 00:46:09,295
Rym: I like it like.

595
00:46:09,336 --> 00:46:10,060
Rym: I think you said it best.

596
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:13,917
Rym: I'm glad I saw it and if you have the chance to see it like remastered.

597
00:46:14,017 --> 00:46:19,274
Scott: it's worth it If you just want to have a sort of a good time.

598
00:46:19,294 --> 00:46:22,260
Scott: if you go to YouTube You watch the low res one.

599
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:26,520
Scott: You can just sort of skip to the the later parts and just sort of watch those awesome.

600
00:46:26,581 --> 00:46:27,915
Scott: See if until the money show up.

601
00:46:28,198 --> 00:46:30,527
Rym: also I got to say the man's like the regular demons.

602
00:46:30,748 --> 00:46:34,887
Rym: if you find really monkeys are building really well animated like they're just funny little guys.

603
00:46:36,401 --> 00:46:40,396
Scott: find where the monkeys are building the stone bridge and that's where you can start watching.

604
00:46:40,476 --> 00:46:46,140
Rym: basically and Strap in cuz it's just gonna be a series of disjointed anime fights.

605
00:46:46,401 --> 00:46:50,980
Rym: The only it they edged real close into heaven in a ton of circus the way this was animated.

606
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:54,918
Scott: Yeah, yeah, I think he just didn't make sense to have missiles.

607
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:57,363
Scott: yeah But there was that.

608
00:46:57,403 --> 00:46:59,289
Scott: there was a Chekhov's chakra.

609
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,940
Rym: Yeah, but soon as that in the beginning cuz Rama's like what's this?

610
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:03,986
Rym: Oh, that's the chakra.

611
00:47:04,006 --> 00:47:05,980
Scott: Yeah, they give at the beginning of the movie.

612
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:13,268
Scott: They give Rama like a whole set of magical weapons like here's your magical weapon equipment And he's like one of them is just a ring.

613
00:47:13,328 --> 00:47:17,579
Scott: It's like a you know throwing blade right chakra, whatever and he's like What's this one?

614
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:21,376
Scott: They're like you'll know when the time comes and it's like he's gonna beat the final boss with that.

615
00:47:21,457 --> 00:47:24,366
Scott: It's like yeah, of course Yeah, it basically works.

616
00:47:24,446 --> 00:47:25,148
Rym: the same way.

617
00:47:25,208 --> 00:47:27,113
Rym: Sailor Moon's first attack works.

618
00:47:27,534 --> 00:47:28,095
Rym: It just fuck.

619
00:47:28,116 --> 00:47:29,499
Scott: Yeah, it's tiara.

620
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:29,800
Scott: whatever.

621
00:47:30,704 --> 00:47:33,900
Rym: Every other attacks you had seemed way less dangerous than that one.

622
00:47:36,451 --> 00:47:37,455
Scott: What's the name of that attack?

623
00:47:37,516 --> 00:47:40,770
Rym: if I remember I haven't seen Sailor Moon all the way since?

624
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:48,809
Rym: 2000 moon tiara action Thursday, but every half season they name it something different.

625
00:47:50,211 --> 00:47:55,529
Scott: Okay, well the internet says it's moon tiara action where she sees like I'll punish you and then she throws up.

626
00:47:56,232 --> 00:48:01,650
Rym: But yeah, if you could see this it's kind of we're seeing if you have an interest in if nothing else.

627
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:06,672
Rym: It's important because the story of how it was made and the fact that it somehow was made it's a.

628
00:48:06,772 --> 00:48:11,787
Scott: it's a significant and interesting work that has you know, really good value.

629
00:48:11,887 --> 00:48:23,779
Scott: animation wise and You know, perhaps so historically it for some people But is not by any means some a S-tier kind of deal.

630
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:34,150
Rym: Yeah, I feel like it will Appear off and on again in late-night rooms at anime cons and Mike tool kind of panels and it's the kind of thing.

631
00:48:34,231 --> 00:48:35,669
Scott: Hey, did you know this cool?

632
00:48:36,011 --> 00:48:37,609
Scott: Did you know this cool thing exists?

633
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:39,816
Scott: Check out this giant demon guy.

634
00:48:40,118 --> 00:48:52,335
Rym: if I were still in charge of a anime club What I would do is we would definitely screen this one night Like we'd figure out a way to scream stream it but you'd want to hype it up to make sure people know They're getting into something weird.

635
00:48:52,717 --> 00:48:55,989
Rym: So you'd probably get a full house just because of the story alone how this thing was made.

636
00:48:58,011 --> 00:49:04,750
Rym: Maybe this has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

637
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:09,529
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

648
00:50:03,393 --> 00:50:12,833
Rym: one of the reasons people seem to do this is because you get a Private RSS feed in patreon and if you're subscribed to other things in patreon That seems to be easier.

649
00:50:12,853 --> 00:50:15,481
Rym: that will continue to work with the new GeekNights website.

650
00:50:15,842 --> 00:50:18,490
Rym: But anyway, that's neither here nor there for now.

651
00:50:19,254 --> 00:50:24,379
Rym: tonight I simply leave you with Tell me the biggest lie an adult has ever

652
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:24,922
Scott: told you

653
00:50:25,424 --> 00:50:25,825
Rym: and when

654
00:50:25,865 --> 00:50:27,492
Scott: you figured out it was a lie I was

655
00:50:27,572 --> 00:50:37,968
Rym: eight and in a play where we made our own instruments and me and some kids did percussion They said we should make some shakers with cans and paper

656
00:50:38,028 --> 00:50:38,369
Scott: and then

657
00:50:39,337 --> 00:50:40,750
Rym: Just fill it up with something.

658
00:50:41,672 --> 00:50:45,170
Rym: Well, our moms made the shakers and most filled them with beans.

659
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:48,442
Rym: But my mom said she filled mine up with fish rocks.

660
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:50,770
Rym: then the bean kids gathered round.

661
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:52,677
Rym: That's what was making my sound.

662
00:50:52,798 --> 00:51:02,950
Rym: I said y'all are in for a big shock Said there's aquarium gravel in my shaker So get ready for a different kind of music.

663
00:51:03,772 --> 00:51:05,597
Rym: They said we don't believe you.

664
00:51:05,697 --> 00:51:07,422
Rym: I said I'll give you a preview.

665
00:51:07,662 --> 00:51:20,429
Rym: So I opened up my shaker to prove it and there were beans just beans just beans.
