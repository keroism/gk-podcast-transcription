1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,036
Rym: It's Thursday August 10th, 2023.

2
00:00:12,036 --> 00:00:12,497
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,178 --> 00:00:13,719
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,879 --> 00:00:15,282
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,342 --> 00:00:19,128
Rym: Tonight we are talking about halls of fame.

6
00:00:19,308 --> 00:00:20,330
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,815
Rym: So Emily was out of town for like two weeks.

8
00:00:23,976 --> 00:00:31,770
Rym: I was on my own recognizance and when I'm home alone for more than like a day, I end up in goblin mode pretty quick.

9
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:35,617
Rym: I'm eating dinner at like 10 o'clock at night.

10
00:00:35,677 --> 00:00:38,923
Rym: I'm like going out to get pizza at like 10 o'clock at night for dinner.

11
00:00:38,943 --> 00:00:42,570
Rym: I'm playing video games and forgetting what time it is.

12
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:47,142
Rym: You know, it's quiet around the house and the rabbit is also like, "Where's Emily?

13
00:00:47,182 --> 00:00:49,689
Rym: And why are you sitting in the computer room all

14
00:00:49,709 --> 00:00:49,870
Rym: day?".

15
00:00:50,411 --> 00:00:58,330
Rym: But one thing I did over the weekend, last weekend, is I just biked up to Kipsy on my own for, you know, biked 100 miles just for fun.

16
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:02,775
Rym: And on the way home, I'm at Poughkeepsie.

17
00:01:03,877 --> 00:01:13,930
Rym: Well, first I'm in the restaurant I'm having dinner at before I'm going to get on the train and I look and there are six minutes before the next train leaves back to New York City.

18
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:15,432
Rym: The restaurant is...

19
00:01:15,612 --> 00:01:18,600
Scott: If you miss that one, you're going to be waiting 66 minutes.

20
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,462
Scott: Exactly.

21
00:01:19,482 --> 00:01:22,210
Rym: In Poughkeepsie where there's really nothing to do.

22
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:30,204
Rym: So I get to check and the restaurant is like 30 seconds away from the train and I get to the train station.

23
00:01:30,444 --> 00:01:32,509
Rym: I see I've got two minutes before the train's going to leave.

24
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:33,030
Rym: It's all good.

25
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:34,933
Scott: And I am walking.

26
00:01:34,953 --> 00:01:36,738
Scott: The train didn't come early and leave early?

27
00:01:36,918 --> 00:01:38,362
Rym: No, because remember, it's the end station.

28
00:01:38,402 --> 00:01:39,565
Rym: So that train never leaves early.

29
00:01:39,605 --> 00:01:41,169
Scott: In fact, it usually leaves, right, right, right.

30
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:46,483
Rym: It usually leaves a few minutes late and they usually don't open the doors to even let people on the train until it's supposed to leave.

31
00:01:47,466 --> 00:01:48,769
Rym: I've been on that train many a time.

32
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:57,710
Rym: So as I'm in the train station, I'm walking with my bike and I see two conductors who I'm 100% sure are the conductors for the train I'm taking.

33
00:01:58,431 --> 00:02:01,343
Rym: And they're talking to each other and one of them says, "Watch out.

34
00:02:01,383 --> 00:02:02,929
Rym: I heard there's like 50 bikes down

35
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:03,110
Rym: there.".

36
00:02:05,432 --> 00:02:08,323
Rym: And Venture North has the right to just say, "Sorry, too many bikes.

37
00:02:08,383 --> 00:02:08,564
Rym: Fuck

38
00:02:08,604 --> 00:02:08,845
Rym: you.".

39
00:02:08,906 --> 00:02:09,930
Rym: And they don't let you on the train.

40
00:02:11,511 --> 00:02:14,460
Scott: Well, I think it depends on the train.

41
00:02:14,521 --> 00:02:17,370
Scott: Some of the trains, they now actually put a bicycle symbol.

42
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,372
Rym: So they do that.

43
00:02:18,493 --> 00:02:19,655
Rym: I learned from the conductor.

44
00:02:19,716 --> 00:02:21,460
Rym: That symbol means nothing.

45
00:02:21,961 --> 00:02:25,690
Rym: No train and no conductor has even knows that exists.

46
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:30,101
Scott: They definitely have some written policies and then all the conductors.

47
00:02:30,322 --> 00:02:33,250
Scott: The policies, each conductor does whatever the fuck they want.

48
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,875
Scott: There is no actual, the written policy is meaningless.

49
00:02:37,937 --> 00:02:47,055
Scott: However, I do know that various bike clubs and bike organizations will call the MTA and say, "Hey, we're doing a bike ride.

50
00:02:47,075 --> 00:02:48,719
Scott: This many bikes are coming to the

51
00:02:48,779 --> 00:02:49,160
Scott: train.".

52
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:53,190
Scott: And the MTA does do some amount of accommodating.

53
00:02:54,252 --> 00:02:55,434
Scott: That is non-zero.

54
00:02:55,494 --> 00:03:01,186
Scott: When you let them know in advance, "We're doing a bike ride on Sunday and we're going to take the 3 p.m.

55
00:03:01,246 --> 00:03:02,769
Scott: train home from such and such

56
00:03:02,829 --> 00:03:03,110
Scott: place.".

57
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:10,370
Rym: So they're saying this and they're standing by the elevator and I come behind with my bike and they look at me and they just laugh.

58
00:03:10,952 --> 00:03:12,116
Rym: And then they look back at each other.

59
00:03:12,156 --> 00:03:13,903
Rym: Then we get down and there's not 50 bikes.

60
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,770
Rym: There's like 10 bikes.

61
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:21,480
Scott: 50 bikes would be like a super organized mega ride.

62
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,804
Scott: That's very unusual, right?

63
00:03:22,844 --> 00:03:25,230
Scott: Most group rides are going to be 10.

64
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,937
Rym: So everyone on the platform except me was part of a group ride.

65
00:03:28,157 --> 00:03:33,250
Rym: I was the only one with a bike on this train who was not part of this group ride.

66
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:41,870
Rym: And even though this train was designated with the special Bike Plus symbol, the conductor was like, "There's only one car that the bikes can go in.

67
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,042
Rym: So all you bike people get in this one car and just make it fit.

68
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:46,267
Rym: Make it

69
00:03:46,327 --> 00:03:46,528
Rym: fit.".

70
00:03:46,588 --> 00:03:47,090
Rym: And it was fine.

71
00:03:47,711 --> 00:03:53,390
Rym: So I hung out with all of these bike people on the way home and there were a bunch of fun stories hanging out with all these people.

72
00:03:53,771 --> 00:03:58,470
Rym: They took their bikes on the train to Poughkeepsie, biked around all day and then took the train back.

73
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:01,249
Rym: I was the only one who biked to Poughkeepsie and took the train back.

74
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:08,646
Rym: But we start talking about where people went to college and I mentioned, "Oh yeah, I went to a place upstate.

75
00:04:08,887 --> 00:04:09,228
Rym: RIT.".

76
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:16,741
Rym: And this one guy, I'm quoting him exactly word for word, says, "RIT.

77
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:17,822
Rym: Damn.

78
00:04:18,243 --> 00:04:20,065
Rym: That's a big brain school.

79
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:21,228
Rym: How'd you get into

80
00:04:21,468 --> 00:04:21,748
Rym: RIT?".

81
00:04:24,852 --> 00:04:28,023
Rym: And these people, they all went to different schools and they're all like, "Yeah, RIT.

82
00:04:28,043 --> 00:04:29,247
Rym: We got some friends who went to RIT.

83
00:04:29,267 --> 00:04:29,789
Rym: They make big

84
00:04:29,849 --> 00:04:30,090
Rym: money.".

85
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,717
Rym: And I was like, "You know, I make big

86
00:04:31,758 --> 00:04:31,959
Rym: money.".

87
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:34,129
Scott: "You will make money, but it's not a big brain

88
00:04:34,209 --> 00:04:34,370
Scott: school."

89
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,158
Scott: At least among this group of bikers.

90
00:04:36,258 --> 00:04:37,948
Scott: "A lot of people went there with poor

91
00:04:37,969 --> 00:04:38,089
Scott: grades.".

92
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:42,322
Rym: Remember though, when we went there, RIT was a very different school.

93
00:04:42,503 --> 00:04:44,490
Rym: It was a third the size physically.

94
00:04:47,031 --> 00:04:51,001
Rym: When we got there, the edge of campus was like crossroads.

95
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,888
Rym: That's not even the center of campus anymore.

96
00:04:53,929 --> 00:04:54,430
Rym: It's so big.

97
00:04:55,331 --> 00:04:57,778
Rym: And two, tuition is way more than it used to be.

98
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:01,729
Rym: And three, they don't let people with Ds in anymore like they used to.

99
00:05:03,754 --> 00:05:04,989
Scott: They used to let them in and kick them out.

100
00:05:05,731 --> 00:05:10,595
Rym: The attrition rate in IT and CS is no longer more than 50%.

101
00:05:10,595 --> 00:05:11,029
Scott: Yeah, whatever.

102
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:19,190
Rym: But yeah, the moment when this guy is like, "Big brain school," and they're all like, "Wow, you went to RIT," was a weird moment.

103
00:05:22,553 --> 00:05:25,447
Scott: You could react that way if someone says, "Yeah, I have a PhD from

104
00:05:25,567 --> 00:05:25,949
Scott: Oxford.".

105
00:05:27,492 --> 00:05:31,590
Rym: Usually when I tell people I went to RIT, people think I said RPI for some reason.

106
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:31,955
Scott: That's right.

107
00:05:31,996 --> 00:05:32,850
Scott: That's exactly right.

108
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:33,908
Rym: And that was a shift.

109
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:37,867
Scott: But if they are, usually if that person knows RIT, they'll be like,

110
00:05:38,068 --> 00:05:38,148
Scott: "Ah.".

111
00:05:38,951 --> 00:05:43,186
Scott: If they know that, they'll be like, "Ah, people normally confuse RPI, but it wasn't.

112
00:05:43,306 --> 00:05:43,346
Scott: I

113
00:05:43,406 --> 00:05:43,567
Scott: know.".

114
00:05:44,836 --> 00:05:45,710
Scott: So it's one or the other.

115
00:05:45,871 --> 00:05:48,785
Rym: And then one of the other people is like, "Wait, didn't they have a really good hockey

116
00:05:48,825 --> 00:05:49,026
Rym: team?".

117
00:05:50,872 --> 00:05:53,309
Rym: And it was a whole RIT conversation with these kids.

118
00:05:54,571 --> 00:05:56,969
Rym: And they had heard of the RIT Anime Club, too.

119
00:05:57,918 --> 00:05:58,649
Scott: Like, they knew of it.

120
00:05:59,554 --> 00:05:59,829
Scott: Okay.

121
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:01,781
Rym: So yeah, that was my fun ride home.

122
00:06:01,902 --> 00:06:02,708
Rym: That was what I got.

123
00:06:04,551 --> 00:06:09,250
Rym: In the news, and this is, I feel like we at least need to mention it, but I don't want to dwell on it.

124
00:06:09,591 --> 00:06:19,670
Rym: I'm mentioning this partly because there is a good chance that the United States is going to need to raise a lot of Red Cross money in a hurry.

125
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:27,130
Rym: There are catastrophic wildfires that came out of nowhere in Hawaii right now.

126
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:31,750
Rym: This is a rapidly developing "send in the military" situation.

127
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:34,090
Scott: Yeah, I mean, it's like we had fires in Canada.

128
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,322
Scott: We got fires in the PNW.

129
00:06:36,411 --> 00:06:38,309
Scott: We got fires all over the earth, basically, right?

130
00:06:38,611 --> 00:06:43,530
Scott: Australia had fires, you know, but it's like Hawaii was not the place I thought was going to be set on fires.

131
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:47,910
Scott: First of all, I thought it was all palm trees, which usually you don't associate with being set on fire.

132
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:54,500
Rym: I learned a lot about these wildfires from reading the news, and there's like a terrifying confluence of situation.

133
00:06:55,631 --> 00:06:57,041
Scott: Usually I think of a fire in Hawaii.

134
00:06:57,062 --> 00:06:58,149
Scott: I think the volcano erupted.

135
00:06:59,442 --> 00:06:59,688
Scott: But no.

136
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,930
Rym: So the root cause is directly climate change.

137
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,528
Rym: Climate change caused this.

138
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:05,485
Rym: Full stop.

139
00:07:06,417 --> 00:07:07,929
Scott: Climate change made it too dry.

140
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,789
Scott: And then a hurricane blew wind.

141
00:07:10,573 --> 00:07:11,129
Scott: Wind plus dry.

142
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:18,030
Rym: A hurricane caused by climate change, exacerbated by the fact that the air was very dry because of climate change.

143
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:24,530
Scott: Right, but the point is dry plus wind plus any amount of heat sparking is good.

144
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:24,938
Scott: There you go.

145
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:25,164
Rym: Fire.

146
00:07:25,185 --> 00:07:25,329
Rym: Boom.

147
00:07:25,872 --> 00:07:26,628
Rym: Plus the shape.

148
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:29,109
Scott: There's a bellows and his kindling.

149
00:07:29,251 --> 00:07:29,590
Scott: It's even worse.

150
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,790
Scott: You're missing only one ingredient.

151
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:33,188
Scott: As soon as that ingredient comes in, you're all done.

152
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,050
Rym: It's even worse.

153
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:40,970
Rym: The shape of the island actually is contributing to this directly in ways that I'm not going to explain because I barely understand them.

154
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,108
Rym: Read the internet about this.

155
00:07:42,811 --> 00:07:46,530
Rym: But these fires appeared out of nowhere, overran entire towns.

156
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:51,550
Rym: People are literally like jumped into the sea to safety and like boats are trying to save them.

157
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,309
Scott: There were some people who jumped into the sea.

158
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:53,973
Rym: No, there's a lot.

159
00:07:54,013 --> 00:07:54,677
Rym: I saw the video.

160
00:07:54,717 --> 00:07:57,130
Rym: The Coast Guard is like setting up a thing around this now.

161
00:07:58,072 --> 00:07:59,180
Rym: It's moving rapidly.

162
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,650
Rym: At least 40 people are dead.

163
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:04,489
Scott: I imagine most of the people are far enough away from it now that they're not jumping in the sea.

164
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:08,430
Rym: Yes, but that was in La Jaina, I think is where that was happening.

165
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,970
Scott: Yeah, but the point is their houses are gone.

166
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,470
Rym: Yeah, entire towns are gone.

167
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:18,530
Scott: This isn't what we were experiencing where there was a wildfire off in the woods and it just covers us in smoke and we have to hide indoors.

168
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:22,250
Scott: This is, no, actually all the houses get burned down and the whole city's gone.

169
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,249
Rym: But the trickiest part right now.

170
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,890
Scott: People are being set on fire and dying.

171
00:08:26,151 --> 00:08:31,028
Rym: Is that we're not getting a lot of detailed reporting and we don't know.

172
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,869
Scott: Who's going to go there and report on it?

173
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:40,909
Rym: We don't know the full situation because the cell phone networks are largely collapsed in these areas now and first responders can't get in.

174
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:52,390
Rym: The United States government just declared this basically a maximum scale disaster and FEMA and the Coast Guard and the Red Cross and the military are like mobilizing around this.

175
00:08:55,031 --> 00:09:00,390
Scott: It's the catastrophic disaster of, you know, it's basically like Godzilla level.

176
00:09:01,531 --> 00:09:12,590
Rym: Yeah, this is climate change world and if you know anyone who doesn't think climate change is real or rejects the idea that we should do something about it, they are evil and you should not associate with them.

177
00:09:13,972 --> 00:09:20,050
Scott: The bill for all these damages should be paid for by oil companies directly, not tax companies.

178
00:09:20,672 --> 00:09:28,090
Scott: It's like if this costs six billion to repair, we just fine all the oil companies collectively six billion dollars.

179
00:09:28,751 --> 00:09:32,550
Rym: Maybe some car companies along the way, like the first companies that marketed SUVs.

180
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:38,670
Scott: You got a coal power plant, we will just garnish your profits, a hundred percent of them, until all is made whole.

181
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,290
Rym: Also, Joe Manchin in particular just emptied his bank account.

182
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,490
Rym: It's a drop in the bucket, but we should still empty that bank account.

183
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:45,609
Scott: Just saying.

184
00:09:46,191 --> 00:09:51,300
Rym: But in some news that's positive, because I want to make a point.

185
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:56,730
Rym: when we talk about these kinds of things to talk about we don't always lose, it's not always a disaster.

186
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:08,090
Rym: There was a huge vote in Ohio that most people who don't live in the state of Ohio or are not extremely possibly overly dialed into American politics would not have known about.

187
00:10:08,531 --> 00:10:16,150
Rym: But there was an August election in Ohio, which is like, normally this is one of those election dates that is only in Ohio.

188
00:10:16,812 --> 00:10:18,665
Scott: Is it an election if you're not electing people?

189
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:19,370
Scott: Is it just a vote?

190
00:10:19,711 --> 00:10:20,233
Rym: It's a vote.

191
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,338
Rym: It's a voting day.

192
00:10:21,358 --> 00:10:24,050
Rym: I don't know the full details of it because I don't live in Ohio.

193
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:31,490
Rym: But it's basically, it's rarely used and even when there's a vote on these dates, nobody votes in them.

194
00:10:32,071 --> 00:10:39,110
Rym: But this one had some of the highest turnouts ever of any election in Ohio because there's a back story that's kind of important.

195
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:45,083
Rym: So, Ohio is run by the fascist party in America, the Republicans, but by a small majority.

196
00:10:45,143 --> 00:10:46,245
Rym: This is like 52%, 48% statewide.

197
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:53,627
Rym: Like it's a very close majority, but they control the government and they're basically banning abortion.

198
00:10:53,767 --> 00:10:54,610
Rym: Like that's what they're doing.

199
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:57,779
Scott: Well, but they can't just ban it straight up.

200
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,850
Scott: They need to have a vote directly from the people.

201
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:01,852
Rym: Well, no, not quite.

202
00:11:01,892 --> 00:11:03,596
Rym: So they can just ban it straight up.

203
00:11:03,917 --> 00:11:17,310
Rym: However, Ohio has a thing, a long-standing thing where the people of Ohio, regardless of parties and districts and anything, can put constitutional amendments to their state's constitution on the ballot.

204
00:11:17,971 --> 00:11:20,577
Rym: And those are just a full-on majority vote.

205
00:11:21,018 --> 00:11:21,880
Rym: If you get 51%, you get 50.01%.

206
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,883
Rym: It's now in the constitution.

207
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:35,770
Rym: So people who want to protect the right to reproductive care basically put a "you have a right to get abortions" constitutional amendment on the ballot.

208
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:40,550
Rym: And that would supersede anything the Republicans are doing to ban abortion in the state.

209
00:11:42,012 --> 00:11:46,010
Scott: So even if you voted, it's like, let's say there was, you know, it's actually kind of interesting, right?

210
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:50,586
Scott: Because it's like, hey, let's say you have a party and theoretically that you agreed with 90%, right?

211
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:54,938
Scott: But 10% of what they do, you don't agree with.

212
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:58,247
Scott: It's like, but the other party you only agree with like 10%.

213
00:11:58,247 --> 00:11:59,530
Scott: You're not voting for them, right?

214
00:11:59,851 --> 00:12:03,982
Scott: But what you could do is you could vote for the party you agree with 90%.

215
00:12:03,982 --> 00:12:18,447
Scott: And then for the other 10%, you could just say, hey, all the people who aren't politicians, right, we voted for this party because we like it, but we, the people, don't actually agree with the evil politicians in this party who are 10% evil, right?

216
00:12:21,111 --> 00:12:25,121
Scott: So we're just going to direct democracy the other 10% and go around them.

217
00:12:26,043 --> 00:12:28,790
Scott: And thus the will of the people wins out.

218
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:32,770
Scott: You get the 90% you agree with and the other 10% that you agree with and the majority rules.

219
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:41,547
Rym: And early polling showed that about 59% of the people in Ohio want abortion protections in the state constitution.

220
00:12:41,567 --> 00:12:43,070
Rym: So this is definitely going to pass.

221
00:12:43,451 --> 00:12:48,258
Scott: So a state that is 50/50 Republican, you know, Democrat-ish, right?

222
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:56,330
Scott: Those numbers indicate that, well, 20% of the Republicans actually want abortion to be legal.

223
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:57,698
Rym: Yep.

224
00:12:57,718 --> 00:12:59,270
Rym: So what did the Republicans do?

225
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:07,170
Rym: They took this weird August vote that normally like doesn't even happen that nobody votes in and they put a measure in there.

226
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:16,926
Rym: And that measure was to change the threshold for one of these statewide constitutional amendments from 50% to match the broken U.S.

227
00:13:17,026 --> 00:13:20,051
Rym: Senate threshold of 60%.

228
00:13:20,051 --> 00:13:22,710
Scott: And they chose the Senate threshold of 66%.

229
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,114
Rym: Well, yeah, it's even worse than the Senate.

230
00:13:24,415 --> 00:13:26,160
Rym: You know why they picked 60%?

231
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,386
Rym: Because 59% of Ohioans want the right to an abortion.

232
00:13:30,531 --> 00:13:30,888
Scott: That's right.

233
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:47,685
Rym: So the vote, the people of Ohio, the people of Ohio voted 59% to continue to have majority rule instead of minority rule, thus preventing the Republicans from preventing the constitutional amendment to protect abortion.

234
00:13:47,946 --> 00:14:00,433
Rym: that's going to be in the November ballot, which is really important because the November ballot is going to determine things like who controls the House of the United States, all sorts of other things like.

235
00:14:00,493 --> 00:14:03,757
Rym: this is huge for U.S.

236
00:14:03,798 --> 00:14:12,730
Rym: democracy because the fundamental problem in American democracy is that a minority can block the majority will on anything.

237
00:14:13,471 --> 00:14:21,750
Rym: And Ohio actually, despite all the problems in that state, voted to say that a majority of people should generally get what they want.

238
00:14:23,212 --> 00:14:30,589
Scott: I mean, you know, this is the thing is that there are people and too many people in this country who, you know, don't believe the results of the elections, right?

239
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:34,964
Scott: Is that they'll say for various reasons like, no, that's not, you know, the vote is wrong.

240
00:14:34,984 --> 00:14:35,666
Scott: We've been lied to.

241
00:14:35,686 --> 00:14:36,730
Scott: There's a conspiracy, right?

242
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:40,720
Scott: But even those people, the craziest of the crazies, right?

243
00:14:41,221 --> 00:14:44,650
Scott: They still believe in the principle of democracy.

244
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:53,410
Scott: If you took a whole bus full of those people and were driving on a road trip and you said, hey, should we stop at McDonald's or Pizza Hut, right?

245
00:14:53,991 --> 00:14:55,396
Scott: And if you just said, you know what?

246
00:14:55,517 --> 00:14:56,059
Scott: I'm in charge.

247
00:14:56,139 --> 00:14:57,424
Scott: I'm deciding it's Pizza Hut.

248
00:14:57,464 --> 00:14:58,970
Rym: They would go rabble, rabble, rabble, right?

249
00:14:59,110 --> 00:14:59,952
Scott: They don't like democracy.

250
00:14:59,972 --> 00:15:01,374
Scott: They don't like dictatorship, right?

251
00:15:01,715 --> 00:15:21,210
Scott: And if you said, OK, let's vote and everyone raised their hands and saw for themselves how many hands there were for Pizza Hut versus McDonald's, the even if it was, you know, a one person swing vote, all the people on the losing side who voted Pizza Hut and wanted, you know, and and lost would go to the McDonald's.

252
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:26,350
Scott: They would go along with the majority because they still believe in that fundamental principle.

253
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:30,588
Scott: So this election, I guess if it was an election vote, whatever it was, I don't know.

254
00:15:30,608 --> 00:15:31,130
Scott: Right.

255
00:15:31,651 --> 00:15:35,383
Scott: The what was on the ballot was that question.

256
00:15:35,543 --> 00:15:35,784
Scott: Right.

257
00:15:35,864 --> 00:15:37,750
Scott: It was should majority rule.

258
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:42,009
Scott: And even Republican people are like, yes.

259
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,716
Rym: It seemed this pattern, this 40 percent.

260
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:51,150
Scott: And then, of course, of course, the savvy people know what they're really voting on, which is should there be abortion?

261
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,311
Scott: And of course, yes.

262
00:15:52,772 --> 00:15:52,952
Scott: Right.

263
00:15:53,012 --> 00:16:12,050
Rym: So but the 40 percent number is interesting to me because on pretty much every issue in American politics, the split in America is roughly 60, 40 in favor of what progressives and Democrats want, or at least in that direction slightly.

264
00:16:12,891 --> 00:16:18,370
Rym: But yet American politics tends to go in the direction of what the 40 percent want.

265
00:16:18,873 --> 00:16:21,810
Rym: Only 40 percent of Americans are like irredeemable shitheads.

266
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:33,250
Rym: There are people between that 40 percent and the other side that are reachable in some way, or at least regardless of if you disagree with them, they believe in this basic concept of democracy to an extent.

267
00:16:34,391 --> 00:16:34,571
Scott: Yeah.

268
00:16:34,591 --> 00:16:46,890
Scott: It's like, you know, the first thing that those people yell about right is like, you know, when they're being racist and nationalist against foreign countries, they're always ratting on other countries for their shitty dictators and their communist autocrats.

269
00:16:47,191 --> 00:16:47,391
Scott: Right.

270
00:16:47,411 --> 00:16:54,704
Scott: It's like they also don't like, you know, those things, at least they believe in voting.

271
00:16:54,784 --> 00:16:58,330
Scott: They just, you know, they're wrong about everything else.

272
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:58,710
Scott: Yeah.

273
00:16:58,891 --> 00:17:00,133
Rym: But I guess this is like this is.

274
00:17:00,514 --> 00:17:02,557
Rym: this is just unequivocal good news.

275
00:17:02,778 --> 00:17:05,021
Rym: And I wanted you should celebrate this.

276
00:17:05,122 --> 00:17:09,950
Rym: This is a. this is a big deal that this happened, especially in a state like at least for the people in Ohio.

277
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:12,750
Scott: But a lot of other people in other states are just in trouble.

278
00:17:13,191 --> 00:17:14,154
Rym: Yup.

279
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:18,950
Rym: But one state at a time, like you can't you can't you can't crank.

280
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:19,590
Rym: You know what?

281
00:17:19,611 --> 00:17:20,977
Rym: There's a good analogy around trains.

282
00:17:21,157 --> 00:17:23,790
Rym: Freight trains don't start moving the entire train at once.

283
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,776
Rym: There's there's slack in the system.

284
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:29,230
Rym: The engine starts moving and it's only pulling the first car.

285
00:17:29,851 --> 00:17:37,590
Rym: And once it once the first car is moving a little bit, the first car starts pulling the second car and then the third car and then the fourth car.

286
00:17:38,011 --> 00:17:41,102
Rym: No train on earth starts pulling all the cars at the same time.

287
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,210
Rym: That is literally impossible.

288
00:17:44,136 --> 00:17:44,298
Scott: Yep.

289
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:44,929
Scott: That's true.

290
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:48,109
Rym: Do you have a news or should we get right into the fun bit?

291
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:49,674
Scott: Yeah, there's not.

292
00:17:49,714 --> 00:17:51,504
Scott: You know, there's some gaming news and whatnot.

293
00:17:51,524 --> 00:17:52,550
Rym: Save that for Tuesday.

294
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,550
Scott: I got a news that will make an appearance in the minimum.

295
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:00,468
Rym: Oh, well, then I guess it's time for I won't get overexcited and skip it.

296
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:03,430
Scott: The Things of the Day.

297
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,253
Rym: This is a short.

298
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,078
Rym: It looks like it was made in VR chat.

299
00:18:08,141 --> 00:18:11,230
Rym: I'm not sure, but it's a little skit.

300
00:18:11,611 --> 00:18:13,520
Rym: It's 37 seconds long and it is.

301
00:18:13,942 --> 00:18:14,966
Rym: it made me laugh out loud.

302
00:18:15,067 --> 00:18:15,750
Rym: I thought it was cute.

303
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:23,050
Rym: It is Rauru, Ganondorf and Link discussing how the fight's about to go down in Tears of the Kingdom.

304
00:18:23,611 --> 00:18:31,730
Rym: And the line, the line that I love, whenever someone says these words, it's usually a funny or interesting situation.

305
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:34,297
Rym: It's something that a phrase you can borrow.

306
00:18:34,979 --> 00:18:35,501
Rym: Say less.

307
00:18:37,327 --> 00:18:38,130
Rym: Just say less.

308
00:18:40,012 --> 00:18:40,656
Rym: That's all I got.

309
00:18:40,677 --> 00:18:41,663
Rym: Yeah, I think you'll laugh at this.

310
00:18:41,683 --> 00:18:42,650
Rym: So what do you got?

311
00:18:44,231 --> 00:18:58,490
Scott: So Michael Chavon, you know, Pulitzer Prize winning author of book club, book selection, Cavalier and Clay, among many others during the dark times, did a very small project.

312
00:18:59,351 --> 00:19:08,750
Scott: He basically put together this image, which he basically tried to recreate the bookshelf from the bookstore that he went to in his young days.

313
00:19:10,013 --> 00:19:17,230
Scott: So he found all these book covers and arranged them in this JPEG in high resolution, I guess, to use as like a wallpaper.

314
00:19:18,571 --> 00:19:29,330
Scott: But for your purposes, I guess you could use it as a wallpaper if you want, because it's lots of cool old, you know, 60s, 70s style, you know, sci fi fantasy book covers.

315
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:32,362
Rym: I got it way zoomed out, but I recognize several of these.

316
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,230
Scott: Yes, recognize a whole pile of them.

317
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:34,531
Scott: Right.

318
00:19:35,052 --> 00:19:41,870
Scott: But at the same time, it is also a very useful JPEG because you can just go and read all these books in this JPEG.

319
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:43,230
Scott: Right.

320
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:50,510
Rym: It's like talking about a set piece, curated collection of likely worth reading or books other than the Star Trek section.

321
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,557
Scott: It's like you can pretty much hit up this whole thing.

322
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,784
Rym: Star Trek novels aren't that bad.

323
00:19:55,887 --> 00:19:56,710
Scott: I just don't like Star Trek.

324
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:58,915
Rym: Yeah, I know you don't, but they're not.

325
00:19:59,135 --> 00:20:05,929
Rym: they're not forgotten realms books, which I did read many of and my low key regret that in my old age.

326
00:20:07,911 --> 00:20:11,030
Scott: Yeah, I don't think forgotten realms books existed at this time.

327
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:13,449
Rym: No, they I do not think they did either.

328
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:15,467
Scott: Yeah, so.

329
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:19,263
Rym: In the meta moment, the GeekNights Book Club book, I have to update the post.

330
00:20:19,323 --> 00:20:21,010
Rym: It still says this is how you lose the time war.

331
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:21,692
Rym: That's the book.

332
00:20:21,732 --> 00:20:24,001
Rym: The book will be Murderbot Diaries.

333
00:20:24,061 --> 00:20:26,249
Rym: And we're just going to read as many of them as we read.

334
00:20:27,232 --> 00:20:28,316
Scott: All right.

335
00:20:28,336 --> 00:20:29,621
Rym: So progress update September.

336
00:20:30,123 --> 00:20:31,709
Scott: progress update after dinner.

337
00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:32,050
Scott: Yes.

338
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:40,070
Scott: Last yesterday I went I finished work and then I went to go buy some enchiladas and I ate them and I ate the enchiladas in one park.

339
00:20:40,751 --> 00:20:46,770
Scott: And then I walked to a different park and laid on the bench and I started reading the first book.

340
00:20:47,351 --> 00:20:51,546
Scott: Oh, and then the sunset and then I finished reading that first book.

341
00:20:51,586 --> 00:20:52,630
Scott: So I'm already one book in.

342
00:20:53,233 --> 00:20:54,550
Rym: I have not even started reading yet.

343
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:57,217
Scott: One day, one book, one day, one book.

344
00:20:57,297 --> 00:21:02,310
Scott: So after you read and complete one book, I'll go to a second book.

345
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:06,770
Scott: And then in the meantime, I'll read something different while I wait for you to catch up.

346
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,441
Rym: That first book will be pretty soon.

347
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:09,690
Rym: These are not long books.

348
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:14,864
Scott: It literally took me maybe two and a half hours, I guess, laying on a bench.

349
00:21:15,004 --> 00:21:16,669
Rym: So, you know.

350
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:27,190
Rym: And of course, the other update, we will be live at PAX West 2023 with a brand new panel, Games You Can't Play.

351
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:29,530
Rym: There's a lot going on there and a lot of topics to discuss.

352
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:35,710
Rym: I'm still sad that we came up with a even better panel after we submitted this one and got it approved.

353
00:21:35,911 --> 00:21:40,410
Rym: But the even better panel will be a very good candidate for a future convention.

354
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:50,425
Scott: Also noteworthy, they just announced today, August 10th, that the keynote speaker of PAX West 2023 will be Reggie Fils-Aime.

355
00:21:54,514 --> 00:21:55,470
Scott: Is your body ready?

356
00:21:55,751 --> 00:21:58,898
Rym: This is the first time in like a decade.

357
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:09,870
Rym: I did not react with, "Huh, that'll be interesting," or, "Eh, don't really care," but reacted with legitimate, direct, immediate, and unprompted excitement about the keynote.

358
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:13,402
Scott: Yeah, my reaction was, "Aw, shit, I gotta go wait in line early.

359
00:22:13,422 --> 00:22:15,189
Scott: I gotta make sure I get in

360
00:22:15,229 --> 00:22:15,430
Scott: there.".

361
00:22:17,053 --> 00:22:26,290
Rym: This is the first keynote in a decade where I legitimately worry it will fill if I just try to stroll in right before it starts.

362
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:27,092
Scott: I do.

363
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:30,410
Scott: You know, there may be a chance to ask a question, right?

364
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:32,870
Rym: I gotta think about what question I would ask.

365
00:22:33,111 --> 00:22:34,275
Scott: No, I've had this question.

366
00:22:34,295 --> 00:22:38,930
Scott: There's a question that I've wanted to ask to at least two people, right?

367
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:42,947
Scott: Tim Apple and Reggie, which is, "Hey, why so

368
00:22:43,008 --> 00:22:43,409
Scott: secret?".

369
00:22:44,691 --> 00:22:45,715
Scott: He's a marketing guy.

370
00:22:45,755 --> 00:22:54,588
Scott: He knows the answer to this question more than I think most people, which is like, "Why do you always keep everything secret and then release everything at

371
00:22:54,728 --> 00:22:54,849
Scott: once?".

372
00:22:55,832 --> 00:23:05,546
Scott: It's like, I can imagine the reasons that you do it that way, but it's like, "Why not just tell us every detail of what's going on all the

373
00:23:05,587 --> 00:23:05,888
Scott: time?".

374
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:09,890
Scott: It's like, do you have studies that show that that's actually better for you?

375
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:10,774
Scott: It's like, do you know?

376
00:23:10,794 --> 00:23:14,610
Scott: Or are you just doing it because it's the way you've always done it and it works, so why mess with it?

377
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:32,090
Scott: As a salesperson trying to market your stuff, do you have some sort of proof that this method of keeping everything secret and defending against leaks is actually more effective than being open, which nobody does?

378
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:41,430
Rym: You know, another strategy would be lots of leak fake stuff to the kinds of people who are obsessed with leaks to the point that everything is meaningless.

379
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:43,918
Scott: Some people do that, right?

380
00:23:43,998 --> 00:23:46,570
Scott: Apple will put out fake info and then people leak it and then they get busted.

381
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:50,947
Rym: I was always a fan of the Valve strategy of Half-Life 2. just fucking came out out of nowhere.

382
00:23:51,007 --> 00:23:51,369
Rym: Here you go.

383
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:53,824
Rym: You didn't even know we were making it.

384
00:23:55,591 --> 00:23:58,270
Scott: I'm just saying, it's like trying to keep secrets, period.

385
00:23:59,352 --> 00:24:02,461
Scott: It's like, you do it, but why?

386
00:24:02,883 --> 00:24:05,370
Scott: Have you even thought about the opposite, like trying it?

387
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:12,821
Scott: Even just for one game, pick one game and just try it and be like, "For this game, the whole development process is going to be open.

388
00:24:12,881 --> 00:24:14,984
Scott: Daily reports to the public.

389
00:24:15,205 --> 00:24:18,550
Scott: Just fucking everything that goes on, we're just going to let you know and keep you in the

390
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:18,710
Scott: loop.".

391
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:25,370
Rym: Oh yeah, imagine if as Tears of the Kingdom was in development, there was like the weekly press conference, just like the presidential press conferences in the government.

392
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,047
Scott: Yeah, it's like we added this feature.

393
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,350
Rym: Sir, sir, sir, tell us about this new character.

394
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:32,400
Scott: Yeah, here's some screenshots, here's the level we're making.

395
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,850
Scott: You know, you could see them change it over time.

396
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:36,508
Scott: Because what's fascinating, you know who does this?

397
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:39,390
Scott: I designed a new monster, I had to redesign the old monster.

398
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:41,694
Rym: A lot of indie developers do this.

399
00:24:41,734 --> 00:24:49,989
Rym: There's some indie developers I follow who literally are like, every day or every few days they're like, "Here's the pre-pre-pre-alpha update on

400
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:50,270
Rym: everything.".

401
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:52,919
Scott: Right, the thing is I know that they do this internally, right?

402
00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:56,190
Scott: They have these status updates daily for their internal team.

403
00:24:56,310 --> 00:25:00,158
Scott: It's like if you work on a game, you're getting daily updates of like what's happening.

404
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:06,110
Scott: It's like, is it really going to hurt you to make that public or will it maybe have the opposite effect of building excitement?

405
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:16,648
Rym: What would be fascinating is if there was a concrete answer given for a specific game or an area of Nintendo where we hear the answer and go, "Oh, wow, that makes sense.

406
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:17,630
Rym: Fascinating.".

407
00:25:17,691 --> 00:25:18,562
Scott: Yeah, it could be.

408
00:25:18,643 --> 00:25:19,210
Scott: I'm just saying.

409
00:25:19,431 --> 00:25:21,089
Rym: I'd love to hear what that answer could be.

410
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:23,478
Scott: I want to know just why so secret, right?

411
00:25:23,618 --> 00:25:27,110
Scott: How do you know that secrecy is the best strategy?

412
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:39,829
Rym: Alright, so let's get right into the main bit because this one I was thinking about partly because not that long ago, Emily and I did go to the Hockey Hall of Fame, which is the first- That was several years ago.

413
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:45,530
Scott: Yeah, that's relatively recently because- I guess relatively recent for how often people go to halls of fame.

414
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:51,419
Rym: I was saying when Scott suggested this idea, my first thought was, "I've been to a lot of halls of

415
00:25:51,459 --> 00:25:51,680
Rym: fame.".

416
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:58,110
Rym: And then I realized I have been to a lot of halls of fame in exactly two places.

417
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:06,010
Rym: Niagara Falls, and I think most of them I would say are effectively fake, and Nashville, Tennessee.

418
00:26:06,832 --> 00:26:08,389
Scott: I know another hall of fame you've been to.

419
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:10,570
Rym: Well, I guess also Pigeon Forge, Tennessee.

420
00:26:10,931 --> 00:26:12,709
Scott: No, there's another hall of fame you've been to.

421
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:13,550
Rym: Been to a few, I think.

422
00:26:13,631 --> 00:26:15,330
Scott: I was there with you at this hall of fame.

423
00:26:16,272 --> 00:26:17,808
Rym: Ah, I'm trying to think of what you're referring to.

424
00:26:19,172 --> 00:26:21,410
Scott: In San Antonio, there was a hallway with a bunch of statues.

425
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:21,936
Rym: Oh, yeah!

426
00:26:23,312 --> 00:26:25,430
Scott: That's a hall, that's literally a hall of fame.

427
00:26:25,572 --> 00:26:25,825
Scott: It is!

428
00:26:26,734 --> 00:26:28,270
Scott: It's just a straight hall of fame.

429
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:36,209
Rym: Considering the Wikipedia article has, I found the Wikipedia article, "List of Halls and Walks of

430
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:36,490
Rym: Fame.".

431
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:36,770
Rym: Yup.

432
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,670
Scott: Because the Hollywood stars, that counts.

433
00:26:39,212 --> 00:26:43,530
Rym: And I think there's a lot to talk about here because this is such a broad topic.

434
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:50,370
Scott: Well, I mean, so a hall of fame is interesting because you could say that it's just a subset of museum, right?

435
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:58,470
Scott: A museum is a place you preserve history, you know, collect artifacts and remembrance for future people, so it's always that, right?

436
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:02,550
Rym: But yet, there are halls of fames that are just lists that do not exist anywhere physically.

437
00:27:02,911 --> 00:27:03,332
Scott: Exactly.

438
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:10,990
Scott: There are halls of fames that do not have any physical presence, do not have any collections, do not have anything of that nature.

439
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:21,730
Scott: It's literally just some committee or some organization somehow with some process votes or decides whatever somehow and whether to add people.

440
00:27:21,851 --> 00:27:22,950
Scott: It's always people, right?

441
00:27:23,251 --> 00:27:24,590
Scott: I guess it doesn't have to always be people.

442
00:27:25,494 --> 00:27:25,896
Rym: No, there's game.

443
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:28,470
Rym: I've seen some halls of fame that were for other things.

444
00:27:29,131 --> 00:27:31,969
Scott: Yeah, I've seen like horses, like horse racing, right?

445
00:27:33,012 --> 00:27:33,633
Scott: Things like that.

446
00:27:33,733 --> 00:27:42,290
Scott: But, you know, it's usually people and then they decide which people are worthy of being included on the list and which one are not.

447
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:55,950
Scott: And this serves, you know, the same purposes as the museum, but it also serves additional purposes, right, of providing recognition to people who are supposedly deserving of it, right?

448
00:27:56,551 --> 00:27:58,595
Rym: I think it's worth reading because it's short.

449
00:27:58,695 --> 00:28:05,710
Rym: Wikipedia, for once, has such a succinct and good definition that it's really good.

450
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:19,110
Rym: A hall, wall, or walk of fame is a list of individuals, achievements, or other entities usually chosen by a group of electors to mark their excellence or fame in their field.

451
00:28:19,511 --> 00:28:31,870
Rym: In some cases, these consist of actual halls or museums that enshrine the honorees with sculptures, plaques, and/or displays of memorabilia and general information regarding such inducted recipients.

452
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:37,730
Scott: Now, there are some things, right, which sort of count as de facto halls of fame that are not.

453
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:43,488
Scott: For example, if you win a Fields Medal, it's like we don't call that the Math Hall of Fame, right?

454
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:48,750
Scott: But it's like a list of Fields Medal winners might as well be the Math Hall of Fame, right?

455
00:28:49,234 --> 00:28:50,668
Scott: Nobel Prize winner, right?

456
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:52,510
Rym: Yup, Pulitzer Prize winner.

457
00:28:53,312 --> 00:28:55,170
Scott: You know, Medal of Honor recipient.

458
00:28:56,532 --> 00:29:01,870
Scott: You know, Knight of the British, whatever the fuck they've got going on over there, I don't know the frickin' words, right?

459
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:08,188
Scott: It's like, you know, significant person who is significant for a reason in a particular category, right?

460
00:29:09,132 --> 00:29:10,870
Scott: And these are big and small, right?

461
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:15,850
Scott: It's like little old middle schools have halls of fame, right, for students and shit, right?

462
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:20,830
Scott: It's like there's so many halls of fame from the big to the small, right, all over the place.

463
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:26,590
Scott: You know, you can find them, like, sometimes you can just find them, like, in a park or in a church or wherever.

464
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,438
Scott: It's like, it's just the smallest place.

465
00:29:28,478 --> 00:29:30,949
Scott: It's like, here's a list of significant people here.

466
00:29:31,391 --> 00:29:34,910
Scott: You know, a summer camp, at least the Hall of Fame, the best campers we've ever had.

467
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:35,894
Rym: You know what, an example?

468
00:29:36,215 --> 00:29:40,190
Rym: The tiniest Hall of Fame that I am in myself.

469
00:29:40,611 --> 00:29:40,734
Rym: In?

470
00:29:41,203 --> 00:29:41,407
Rym: Whoa.

471
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:44,670
Rym: So, this is the tiniest, tiniest Hall of Fame, but I think it counts.

472
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:51,550
Rym: Because a lot of halls of fame serve a very important purpose, I think, in that they are often very local.

473
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:56,090
Rym: And, like, a town will have, like, these are the ten fucking people that made this town.

474
00:29:58,311 --> 00:30:19,150
Rym: My high school, in every classroom that was an AP classroom, along the tops of the wall, and it was big and growing, but there was still plenty of space, anyone who got a five, basically the top scorer on the AP test for that class, got to paint their name in a tiny designated space on this wall.

475
00:30:20,973 --> 00:30:24,330
Rym: And I got to paint my name on seven of those walls.

476
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:25,250
Scott: Yep.

477
00:30:25,711 --> 00:30:35,030
Scott: And so that is the other thing a Hall of Fame does that a museum does not do, which is encourage people, right?

478
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:41,468
Rym: When I was a ninth grader and I had a class that was in one of those rooms, I remember looking up and being like, "What are all those names up

479
00:30:41,488 --> 00:30:41,710
Rym: there?".

480
00:30:41,931 --> 00:30:44,209
Rym: And the teacher's like, "Oh, yeah, those are people who aced the AP

481
00:30:44,229 --> 00:30:44,390
Rym: test.".

482
00:30:44,451 --> 00:30:45,925
Rym: I was like, "My fucking name's going to be up

483
00:30:45,965 --> 00:30:46,107
Rym: there.".

484
00:30:46,576 --> 00:30:46,950
Scott: That's right.

485
00:30:47,271 --> 00:30:48,690
Scott: I thought about that for four years.

486
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:58,510
Scott: I mentioned summer camp because one summer camp I went to, they had in the main hall room, this room in the big house, right?

487
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,239
Scott: There was a thing that said, "Order of

488
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:00,842
Scott: Watanka.".

489
00:31:00,863 --> 00:31:02,090
Scott: It was Camp Watanka, right?

490
00:31:02,451 --> 00:31:04,339
Scott: And it was a very short list of names.

491
00:31:04,681 --> 00:31:06,388
Scott: It's like, "How do you get on the Order of

492
00:31:06,408 --> 00:31:06,890
Scott: Watanka?".

493
00:31:07,051 --> 00:31:09,650
Scott: It was quite, you know, I could have done it except for the push-up requirement.

494
00:31:10,514 --> 00:31:10,764
Rym: Oh, no.

495
00:31:12,391 --> 00:31:20,227
Scott: If it wasn't for the push-up requirement, and literally the way it works is this one day where they're like, "All right, who wants to try to join the Order of

496
00:31:20,268 --> 00:31:20,710
Scott: Watanka?"

497
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:30,170
Scott: And the first thing you have to do is wake up early, come to the flagpole and, B, you do push-ups and the last X people remaining are still in and everyone's out.

498
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:32,650
Scott: And obviously that wasn't going to happen, right?

499
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:34,410
Scott: But everything after that I could have done.

500
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:34,832
Scott: It was like.

501
00:31:34,872 --> 00:31:39,290
Scott: the next thing was like, you know, go and like, you know, do shit at the archery.

502
00:31:39,551 --> 00:31:42,849
Scott: I could have done every other thing on the list after if I made it past step one.

503
00:31:43,752 --> 00:31:46,350
Scott: And I would have made the Order of Watanka likely, right?

504
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:49,070
Scott: The last thing you have to do is sleep in the woods overnight and not die.

505
00:31:49,971 --> 00:31:54,350
Rym: But I think that motivational factor is really important to this concept.

506
00:31:55,398 --> 00:31:56,630
Rym: And I think it's a good thing.

507
00:31:56,670 --> 00:32:05,967
Rym: Like, I don't have a cynical take on this, especially considering, looking at Wikipedia, I just learned where the term Hall of Fame came from.

508
00:32:07,232 --> 00:32:09,545
Rym: And it's very specific and kind of recent.

509
00:32:09,646 --> 00:32:10,310
Rym: It's a thing.

510
00:32:11,531 --> 00:32:16,490
Rym: There was the Rumshall in Munich built in 1853.

511
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:17,959
Scott: With a name like that, obviously.

512
00:32:18,624 --> 00:32:19,570
Scott: You don't need to say the place.

513
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:21,456
Rym: Literally means Hall of Fame.

514
00:32:21,938 --> 00:32:24,370
Rym: It was basically in Germany, in Bavaria.

515
00:32:25,591 --> 00:32:26,129
Scott: You don't say.

516
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:40,910
Rym: Leo von Klenz designed for Ludwig I of Bavaria, a complex to name people who were great and important and keep a record of them for people to know about in the future, basically.

517
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:43,037
Rym: Like, these are people who mattered.

518
00:32:43,338 --> 00:32:46,290
Rym: We have made a Hall of Fame for famous, important Bavarians.

519
00:32:47,351 --> 00:32:53,770
Scott: And the thing is, some of the people are going to be so famous, right, that they didn't really need the Hall of Fame to carry them forward.

520
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:58,270
Rym: Like, Wayne Gretzky did not need the Hockey Hall of Fame for people to remember his name forever.

521
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:01,850
Scott: Not now, but maybe in a hundred years they will.

522
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:10,934
Rym: Yeah, when climate change ends the concept of hockey, and hockey is this ancient sport that was played in a different kind of earth, but maybe there's a Hall of Fame.

523
00:33:10,954 --> 00:33:15,769
Rym: if, yeah, there was this ancient sport and the Hall of Fame listed Wayne Gretzky the first.

524
00:33:17,691 --> 00:33:28,110
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know, just having the list of names might not be valuable for the preservation aspect unless you also preserve, you know, the contextual information of what made the person great, right?

525
00:33:28,871 --> 00:33:31,139
Scott: But they usually do, at least, right?

526
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:40,450
Scott: Even in the San Antonio one, which is just one hallway with statues, each statue had a small plaque which described why they felt that person was worthy and important.

527
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:45,370
Rym: And that's because I think that's very important because I've realized this is an aside, but it's relevant.

528
00:33:45,931 --> 00:33:54,610
Rym: I am increasingly disavowed of the general concept of prescriptive legalism in any domain, like anywhere in the world.

529
00:33:54,730 --> 00:34:01,950
Rym: What I mean by that is a lot of nerds in particular get hung up on an achievement of some kind.

530
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:17,820
Rym: Like, they would expect an award in video games to have objective, specific, extremely prescriptive criteria, and they don't like the idea of people just deciding based on being humans who are smart and trusted to make decisions.

531
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:33,460
Rym: And Halls of Fame seem to nearly universally rely on a group of people who are generally trusted or who have at least agreed to come together to make this decision, and the criteria is basically these people decide.

532
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:41,280
Rym: Like, the Hockey Hall of Fame doesn't have a scorecard so much as they vote and discuss and debate who will enter the Hall of Fame year after year.

533
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,216
Scott: Of course, the problem there is who are the voters, right?

534
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:49,639
Scott: Which oftentimes, for various Halls of Fame, the people voting could be a bunch of crusty old white guys.

535
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:55,219
Rym: Well, like, the Oscars is a terrible process, and the people who do it are, like, there's a lot of bad people in that process.

536
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,679
Scott: Yes, exactly.

537
00:34:56,739 --> 00:34:58,860
Rym: The Hockey Hall of Fame is actually-- Or they're not doing it properly.

538
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,186
Rym: De facto, the NHL Hall of Fame.

539
00:35:01,226 --> 00:35:14,100
Rym: They, in fact, have a rule that says at least one person has to know something about amateur hockey, and at least one person has to know something about non-NHL hockey, and the rest of them are just NHL people, basically.

540
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:15,682
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

541
00:35:15,782 --> 00:35:21,260
Scott: But there are people who are very important to hockey who are not NHL people who are inducted to the Hockey Hall of Fame.

542
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:26,240
Scott: And I guess this comes down to-- There are people in the Hockey Hall of Fame who were around before NHL existed.

543
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,106
Rym: Yup, and that's, I guess, the important thing.

544
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:32,600
Rym: A Hall of Fame is judged by the quality of its electors.

545
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:48,740
Rym: Because a well-run Hall of Fame, however it is run, whoever makes the decisions, even if it's a dictatorship, if the domain the Hall of Fame is representing generally respects that Hall of Fame, then they're doing something right.

546
00:35:49,541 --> 00:35:51,833
Scott: Yeah, it's like anyone can set up a fucking Hall of Fame.

547
00:35:51,853 --> 00:35:53,120
Scott: I could just set one up right now.

548
00:35:54,243 --> 00:36:10,040
Scott: But to actually be recognized, for people to A) care about getting in, be honored if they get in, I remember the early days of the internet, people would just make up awards, make JPEGs like the Scott Award, and give it to websites, hoping that the websites would post their award with a link back.

549
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,048
Scott: And it's like, but who cares about your award?

550
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:16,800
Scott: And at the end of the day, only the Webby Award got any sort of care about it.

551
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,099
Scott: And even that, eh, no one really cares, right?

552
00:36:20,681 --> 00:36:28,620
Scott: If you make a Hall of Fame, it needs to get recognition, and to be recognized, you actually have to choose wisely and legitimately.

553
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:35,400
Scott: If you're just choosing for illicit reasons, your whole operation becomes suspect and no one cares anymore.

554
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,900
Rym: The Hall of Fame of people who gave me the most money in descending order.

555
00:36:40,961 --> 00:36:42,766
Scott: Exactly.

556
00:36:42,806 --> 00:36:47,320
Scott: That's why you don't call it a Hall of Fame when you have a list of donors at the opera house.

557
00:36:48,281 --> 00:36:51,550
Scott: It's our generous benefactors, it's not Hall of Fame.

558
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:55,260
Scott: The Hall of Fame is for the performers, not for the benefactors.

559
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:04,080
Rym: So the only Hall of Fame I've been to, as in it's also a museum in recent history, is the Hockey Hall of Fame.

560
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,446
Rym: And I gotta say, it's a pretty fantastic museum.

561
00:37:09,669 --> 00:37:15,860
Rym: Even though it's just in the lobby of an office tower, it's just kinda there.

562
00:37:17,241 --> 00:37:18,463
Rym: But it's just a legit museum.

563
00:37:18,503 --> 00:37:20,687
Rym: It was well worth the price of admission.

564
00:37:21,067 --> 00:37:28,319
Rym: My favorite room in it was the room of, "Here are all the deadly hockey masks from the era before we had relatively good modern

565
00:37:28,419 --> 00:37:28,620
Rym: ones.".

566
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:37,297
Scott: Yeah, but that part of it is a museum, which, while the museum is associated with the Hall of Fame, the organization, that part of the museum is not a Hall of Fame.

567
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:48,980
Rym: It's not like they have the preserved body like dead saints of all the hockey players and hockey men inducted into the Hall of Fame are lined up there in some sort of catacomb.

568
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:55,680
Scott: No, you have plaques or photos or just a list of names or you have something of that nature.

569
00:37:55,740 --> 00:38:05,260
Rym: You also have the sections where every person who has been honored, has been inducted as an honoree of the Hockey Hall of Fame, has an area about them.

570
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:12,440
Rym: Which was also really fascinating, especially because if you don't pay attention to the Hockey Hall of Fame, it's not just hockey players.

571
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:18,994
Rym: It's great coaches, people who are just part of the community, some important refs are there.

572
00:38:19,014 --> 00:38:21,260
Rym: All sorts of people are on this list.

573
00:38:22,142 --> 00:38:28,580
Scott: So on the one hand, it's always a constant never-ending debate, especially in sports talk radio, because they got nothing else to talk about.

574
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:32,179
Scott: Especially in the offseason, they got nothing to talk about for any sports, right?

575
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:35,948
Scott: So they're always talking about Halls of Fame, right?

576
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:38,714
Scott: Is this person worthy of making it in?

577
00:38:38,794 --> 00:38:41,200
Scott: Is this person who's still early in their career a shoe-in?

578
00:38:44,203 --> 00:38:47,980
Scott: These are the people who are eligible to get in this year, which ones do you think will make it?

579
00:38:48,622 --> 00:38:51,311
Scott: Do you think it was right that it wasn't unanimous?

580
00:38:51,411 --> 00:38:54,000
Scott: One person voted against just to make it not unanimous?

581
00:38:54,781 --> 00:39:01,980
Scott: All these sorts of debates about who should be in, who shouldn't be in, what counts, is it the Hall of the Very Good?

582
00:39:02,883 --> 00:39:04,874
Scott: Should we raise the bar, right?

583
00:39:05,115 --> 00:39:06,020
Scott: Or should we not?

584
00:39:07,741 --> 00:39:12,080
Scott: Should it just be for people who are very good at doing the thing or also people who made the contribution?

585
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,004
Rym: And how big should it be?

586
00:39:13,024 --> 00:39:16,540
Rym: A Hall of Fame that has 100,000 people in it kind of loses its meaning.

587
00:39:16,902 --> 00:39:18,793
Rym: Hockey Hall of Fame has under 300 people honored total.

588
00:39:20,801 --> 00:39:24,449
Scott: Yeah, it has to be relative to the thing you're doing, right?

589
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:28,457
Scott: As long as the proportion is good enough, right?

590
00:39:31,162 --> 00:39:38,720
Scott: But if the number is too big, if half the people who ever played baseball were in the Baseball Hall of Fame, obviously that wouldn't mean anything.

591
00:39:40,801 --> 00:39:45,160
Rym: Not everyone who won the Stanley Cup is in the Hall of Fame, and many people who never won the Hall of Fame.

592
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,486
Scott: Well, they are in the Hall of Fame.

593
00:39:46,546 --> 00:39:47,551
Scott: They're in one place.

594
00:39:47,591 --> 00:39:48,958
Scott: Their name is on the Stanley Cup.

595
00:39:49,018 --> 00:39:49,299
Scott: That's it.

596
00:39:50,781 --> 00:39:57,100
Rym: They are in the physical Hall of Fame, but they are not inducted as honorees of the Hall of Fame.

597
00:39:57,730 --> 00:39:57,812
Scott: No.

598
00:39:57,833 --> 00:39:58,119
Scott: Not at all.

599
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:01,025
Rym: I think another important aspect is Halls of Fame.

600
00:40:02,227 --> 00:40:08,140
Rym: This is one of the places where a little bit of ceremony and pomp and circumstance I think is important.

601
00:40:08,605 --> 00:40:10,020
Rym: Like that aspect of celebration.

602
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:14,767
Scott: Well, you've got to think like in Hollywood, you put your hands in the cement, right?

603
00:40:15,188 --> 00:40:22,720
Scott: Usually having a thing like that really adds some specialness, some special ceremony.

604
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:26,931
Rym: Even if you fake it till you make it, a brand new Hall of Fame has got to act like.

605
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:30,340
Rym: this is an honored and storied tradition from day one or it's not going to stick.

606
00:40:32,321 --> 00:40:34,625
Scott: Or at least people won't care about it as much.

607
00:40:35,707 --> 00:40:41,516
Scott: If I get inducted into the podcasting Hall of Fame, even if it's the only one and it's super legit, I'd be like,

608
00:40:41,536 --> 00:40:41,957
Scott: "Alright."

609
00:40:43,801 --> 00:40:46,020
Scott: It's like you have to make me care somehow.

610
00:40:46,741 --> 00:40:52,980
Rym: That would have to be like we're in our 70s now and podcasting became something super important and big in the world.

611
00:40:53,481 --> 00:41:06,720
Scott: If they had a place and it's like, yes, there is this special podcasting place and it's like we make a special wall of microphones and we put yours up there with a green one just for you because that's what you want with your name on it.

612
00:41:06,981 --> 00:41:10,220
Rym: It's like you fucking did this the longest of anyone.

613
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:19,298
Scott: Even if that's some crapo Hall of Fame that no one gives a shit about, it's like they still made a special place just for you to be honored.

614
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:23,540
Scott: It's like I would feel somewhat honored if they did that.

615
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:35,680
Rym: It's a mark of respect and it's an earnest one if a group of people in good faith are saying in this area that is a person who was actually important to us and to it in some way and we agree.

616
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:40,260
Scott: It's worthy of being not forgotten to other people engaging in this area in the future.

617
00:41:42,901 --> 00:41:49,173
Scott: A person to look up to at least within one area of life and did worthy contributions, etc.

618
00:41:53,561 --> 00:42:03,300
Rym: So I think wherever you live in the world, if it's a place that you put down some real roots in, like physically, that's a place you feel like is a home to you.

619
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:12,437
Rym: I think it's worthwhile to have a sense of what are the halls of fame or important civic people in that place.

620
00:42:12,597 --> 00:42:14,120
Rym: It's a good thing to know about a place you live.

621
00:42:15,202 --> 00:42:22,355
Scott: A place, not just a physical place, but also any community, any group, any category, whatever your nerdery is.

622
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:27,587
Scott: Maybe you're really into doing pixel art, perler bead stuff.

623
00:42:34,564 --> 00:42:37,616
Scott: If the hall of fame for that thing doesn't exist, make one.

624
00:42:40,806 --> 00:42:42,860
Scott: Start with the most important person.

625
00:42:43,582 --> 00:42:47,160
Scott: This is the person who put in the work to make this thing really take off.

626
00:42:48,881 --> 00:42:51,699
Scott: They've been running this community for so long.

627
00:42:52,924 --> 00:42:54,660
Scott: That's usually how a hall of fame starts.

628
00:42:55,140 --> 00:43:05,720
Scott: You give recognition to one important person and somehow, like we thought what you did was so amazing, we want to recognize you, our most important person.

629
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:13,020
Scott: And then you recognize the second most important person, maybe some years later, and then a hall of fame naturally evolves from that.

630
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:23,000
Rym: And the cool part is, if you do this, then a community or a domain or the thing you care about went from having zero of them to one.

631
00:43:23,482 --> 00:43:28,399
Rym: And if you're bad at it, someone will do it better than you and replace you.

632
00:43:28,982 --> 00:43:32,279
Rym: Or you're the only one and that's better than none.

633
00:43:34,984 --> 00:43:41,420
Scott: It can help to bolster, to enhance, if your community is big enough, it can be a big enhancer.

634
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:43,297
Scott: It can juice your community a little bit.

635
00:43:44,783 --> 00:43:47,040
Scott: Giving them something to talk about in the off season.

636
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:48,659
Scott: Giving them something to strive for.

637
00:43:49,542 --> 00:43:53,057
Scott: If you have a place where this thing exists, a place to go or to think about.

638
00:43:54,941 --> 00:43:59,437
Scott: It can enhance any community where it is applicable.

639
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:11,060
Scott: So either I would encourage people to A, if there is a hall of fame for the thing you do, just put at least a little bit of thought to like, how can you get there?

640
00:44:11,764 --> 00:44:13,338
Scott: What can you do to get into it?

641
00:44:14,222 --> 00:44:18,540
Scott: And maybe change what you're doing in your life to reach it.

642
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:27,900
Scott: Not for reasons of ego or because of award, but because the actions that are taken by someone to reach a legitimate hall of fame.

643
00:44:28,524 --> 00:44:30,800
Scott: Our actions taken in a life well lived.

644
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:41,420
Scott: And so even if you try to strive to reach it and don't, you will still be striving towards things that are worthy of doing right and bettering your, your light, your one life on this earth.

645
00:44:41,981 --> 00:44:48,080
Scott: And if the hall of fame for the thing you do doesn't exist, maybe you don't have to like make a hall of fame just from nothing.

646
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:52,279
Scott: But think about who is the most important person who has done the most work.

647
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:57,059
Scott: It was super worthy of recognition and hasn't gotten any because there isn't anyone to give it.

648
00:44:57,741 --> 00:45:07,080
Scott: And find a way to award that and celebrate that one person one time and give them, I don't know, a piece of paper, like a certificate.

649
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:13,720
Rym: If nothing else, even if you can't, if you can't, won't, or don't do any of those things, learn about that person.

650
00:45:14,361 --> 00:45:23,860
Rym: Like read their biography, like learn if, if you think to yourself in this area that I care about a lot, if I made a hall of fame, this would be the first person I'd put in it.

651
00:45:24,401 --> 00:45:30,599
Rym: If you don't know a lot about that person, learning a lot about them is a great way to enrich yourself and whatever that thing is.

652
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:36,520
Scott: It could even be as simple as like just writing a blog post celebrating that person, right?

653
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:39,231
Scott: Like let me tell you how great person X is, right?

654
00:45:39,271 --> 00:45:41,379
Scott: Who is so important to this community, right?

655
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:45,200
Scott: And you know, and just celebrate them by extolling their virtue.

656
00:45:45,961 --> 00:45:50,240
Scott: And that blog post is basically beginning sort of a hall of fame kinda.

657
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:50,761
Scott: Yeah.

658
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:51,823
Rym: Nothing.

659
00:45:51,843 --> 00:46:02,220
Rym: Maybe, maybe a hundred years later, someone reads that post somehow, like in an archive during research and they're like, that's one of the earliest representations of a hall of fame for that domain.

660
00:46:02,524 --> 00:46:02,820
Scott: Here we go.

661
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:03,783
Scott: That happens a lot.

662
00:46:03,863 --> 00:46:08,960
Scott: is that a lot of hall of fame start and those hall of fame start by inducting the people in recent memory.

663
00:46:09,501 --> 00:46:18,477
Scott: And then years and years later, people dig back and like, Hey, there was this really important person who should be in this hall of fame, but never was because it started in.

664
00:46:18,537 --> 00:46:20,260
Scott: the hall of fame was founded in the racist time.

665
00:46:20,681 --> 00:46:27,400
Scott: So the hall of fame was started in the misogynist times and you left out these people that you didn't even consider back in the day.

666
00:46:27,941 --> 00:46:34,240
Scott: And we found out about them because somebody had bothered to write about them or record about them or something, right?

667
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:43,720
Scott: So in a hundred years, 50 years, I don't know, decades, someone that, you know, GeekNights never makes it in the podcast hall of fame, but someone writes an article about GeekNights.

668
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:50,240
Scott: And when the podcast hall of fame appears in 20, 90, I found there are at least three different podcasts, halls of fame.

669
00:46:50,381 --> 00:46:51,588
Rym: That I'm looking at right now.

670
00:46:51,971 --> 00:46:53,520
Rym: They are, they're fascinating.

671
00:46:54,180 --> 00:47:01,160
Scott: I'm sure they are, but somebody will, will research and realize, Hey, there was this podcast that ran for like way too fucking long.

672
00:47:02,562 --> 00:47:06,259
Scott: Why aren't those people in this hall of fame that you just, no one ever knew about them.

673
00:47:07,384 --> 00:47:10,840
Rym: They weren't popular, but they did it for 70 fucking years.

674
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:15,199
Scott: They were, they were, they were ahead of most of the people at doing it.

675
00:47:16,043 --> 00:47:20,080
Scott: So that's the kind of thing that can happen only to people more deserving of it.

676
00:47:26,301 --> 00:47:28,548
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

677
00:47:28,588 --> 00:47:32,480
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat Lee for web design and brand.

678
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:32,861
Rym: Okay.

679
00:47:32,921 --> 00:47:38,960

681
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:46,639

00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:11,759
Rym: So I don't actually say your names out loud.

686
00:48:12,621 --> 00:48:13,023
Rym: I'm hungry.

687
00:48:13,204 --> 00:48:13,746
Rym: I got nothing.

688
00:48:13,766 --> 00:48:16,760
Rym: I'm just gonna leave you with something that you might not have seen coming.
