1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,957
Rym: It's Monday, January 2nd, 2023.

2
00:00:09,957 --> 00:00:10,259
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,594 --> 00:00:14,006
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,096
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:16,136 --> 00:00:20,170
Rym: Tonight, we are talking about Microsoft Windows.

6
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22,128
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:22,891 --> 00:00:25,730
Rym: You know, the operating system that some of you might have used at one point.

8
00:00:26,591 --> 00:00:28,729
Scott: Sounds like Rym got the year right on the first go.

9
00:00:29,491 --> 00:00:32,198
Rym: You know, I haven't fucked that up for a while.

10
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:34,827
Rym: That's actually one thing that I've gotten control of in my life.

11
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:35,850
Rym: Consistently.

12
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:37,809
Scott: You've had a...

13
00:00:38,851 --> 00:00:40,517
Rym: I've had a few incidents over the years.

14
00:00:40,617 --> 00:00:44,090
Rym: Usually, not the first episode of the year, because you're kind of on point for that one.

15
00:00:44,391 --> 00:00:47,427
Rym: It's always like the second or the third episode of the year that I would fuck it up on.

16
00:00:49,014 --> 00:00:50,350
Rym: You know, when you let your attention slide.

17
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:57,890
Rym: But yeah, we were gonna have a Maloki get together with our friends who live in Queens, New York party.

18
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:05,269
Rym: But the poop charts were off the charts, so we opted for a more recently traditional Discord New Years.

19
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:11,110
Rym: But we got out an old GeekNights tradition from the pre-GeekNights days.

20
00:01:11,211 --> 00:01:13,930
Rym: And we played a game you might have heard of called Illuminati.

21
00:01:15,217 --> 00:01:16,589
Scott: Have we ever reviewed Illuminati?

22
00:01:16,751 --> 00:01:18,189
Scott: A game a lot of people might not have heard of.

23
00:01:19,151 --> 00:01:22,869
Rym: I mean, not many people have even heard of Steve Jackson anymore if they're younger than us.

24
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,430
Rym: Have we ever done an episode on Illuminati?

25
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:28,928
Scott: I don't know.

26
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:30,599
Rym: We're not hurting for Tuesday episodes.

27
00:01:30,961 --> 00:01:31,686
Rym: I-L-L-U.

28
00:01:31,726 --> 00:01:32,310
Rym: Let's look right now.

29
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:32,815
Rym: We have.

30
00:01:32,835 --> 00:01:35,235
Rym: In 2008.

31
00:01:35,235 --> 00:01:35,385
Scott: Okay.

32
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,150
Rym: So we tried something different.

33
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:41,390
Rym: You know, our friend Pete put together something in TTS so we could play it remotely.

34
00:01:41,511 --> 00:01:42,357
Rym: And it was good enough.

35
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:43,990
Rym: And it was totally playable.

36
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:44,666
Rym: And you know what?

37
00:01:46,491 --> 00:01:51,750
Rym: We played enough of the game to remember and feel what it's like to play that game.

38
00:01:52,172 --> 00:01:54,909
Rym: And then we flipped the table at exactly midnight and that was the end of that.

39
00:01:55,932 --> 00:01:56,277
Scott: Let's see.

40
00:01:56,318 --> 00:01:57,069
Scott: That was a good plan.

41
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:58,796
Rym: It scratched that itch.

42
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,350
Rym: if midnight had been later, if we'd started earlier.

43
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:06,510
Rym: I think I could have gone around the table like three or four more times and still be feeling it.

44
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:07,816
Scott: Whoa, that's a lot more times than I was.

45
00:02:07,896 --> 00:02:10,689
Scott: I was ready for maybe one more time.

46
00:02:11,711 --> 00:02:25,628
Rym: I find the point where that game gets to the Intolerable Zone is the first time someone makes a big move and you actually have to stop them because then the game literally turns into, "Alright, let's vote who wins in a very slow

47
00:02:25,648 --> 00:02:25,970
Rym: fashion.".

48
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:27,150
Rym: Off to that point.

49
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:31,524
Scott: What's interesting is that, you know, two Steve Jackson games, right?

50
00:02:31,564 --> 00:02:33,070
Scott: Illuminati and Munchkin, right?

51
00:02:33,251 --> 00:02:35,990
Scott: One much more successful than the other financially, right?

52
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:36,311
Scott: Yep.

53
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:37,808
Rym: Munchkin just prints money.

54
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:46,470
Scott: But both of them are sort of the same in that they have the core enjoyment factor is flip over a card and laugh at it, right?

55
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:46,602
Scott: Yep.

56
00:02:47,051 --> 00:03:00,490
Scott: So, and the thing is both of them have that same mechanic of someone's gonna win on their turn, stop them till the game continues until eventually someone's gonna win and no one can stop them, right?

57
00:03:00,531 --> 00:03:02,029
Scott: And then that person then wins.

58
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:15,570
Scott: The difference is that in Illuminati, right, the determination of which person that's gonna be that's gonna do the winning is based on voting, right?

59
00:03:15,731 --> 00:03:16,032
Rym: Yep.

60
00:03:16,314 --> 00:03:19,550
Scott: Whereas in Munchkin, it's based on luck.

61
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:27,565
Rym: Yeah, well it's not 100% voting because there's a small amount of luck in Illuminati, but there's also the politicking matters a lot more.

62
00:03:27,626 --> 00:03:38,510
Rym: because one thing about Illuminati compared to Munchkin, Munchkin, anyone playing that game can look at it and look at the hands and know who's winning and know like the state of the game.

63
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:47,790
Rym: But Illuminati, it's moderately obscured who is actually winning and there are big plays one could make and there's the final determinant.

64
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,075
Rym: The only problem being it's very hard to pull off.

65
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:55,470
Rym: You could have a joint victory in Illuminati, which you and I achieved once.

66
00:03:56,571 --> 00:04:02,190
Rym: We tried it another time where you fucking betrayed me and then you also lost, which I remember specifically.

67
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:06,270
Rym: That was the night when we all took our shirts off because we were at a friend's house playing the game.

68
00:04:06,591 --> 00:04:08,055
Rym: We were sitting at the table by the heater.

69
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:13,970
Rym: The heater was way too hot, so one by one we all started getting more and more nude playing Illuminati in the corner.

70
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:16,168
Scott: Don't remember any of this.

71
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:17,853
Rym: I have a photo of it.

72
00:04:18,134 --> 00:04:20,221
Rym: Frank took his shirt off first and I was like, you know what?

73
00:04:20,764 --> 00:04:22,350
Rym: That's a good idea and I took my shirt off.

74
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,940
Scott: Okay, but the point is I recommend, you know, ringing in the New Year's.

75
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,310
Scott: A lot of people ring in the New Year by like, you know, watching a thing, right?

76
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,996
Scott: Or like waiting for a thing to happen.

77
00:04:34,096 --> 00:04:37,830
Scott: I recommend ringing in the New Year by doing a thing.

78
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,745
Rym: Yeah, like break a glass or like throw a rock out a window.

79
00:04:40,765 --> 00:04:41,027
Rym: Like, yeah.

80
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:46,581
Scott: I guess those are really simple versions, but yeah, you know, do a thing, right?

81
00:04:47,604 --> 00:04:50,110
Scott: And that's, you know, anyway.

82
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,132
Rym: It was a pretty good thing though.

83
00:04:51,172 --> 00:04:52,215
Rym: Fortnite did a cool thing.

84
00:04:53,378 --> 00:04:57,769
Rym: Last year, Scojo kept yelling at me to like join Fortnite, but I was busy on New Year's.

85
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,155
Rym: But on New Year's Day, they do the Snowpiercer thing.

86
00:05:01,195 --> 00:05:09,910
Rym: So every hour when it's the New Year somewhere on Earth, every Fortnite match, no matter what's happened, no matter how competitive it is, fireworks happen.

87
00:05:10,591 --> 00:05:17,146
Rym: And your character starts dancing uncontrollably and you can't shoot at each other for about 30 seconds.

88
00:05:17,628 --> 00:05:18,590
Rym: And then the game just starts again.

89
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:21,970
Scott: So if you were in a close range firefight at that moment.

90
00:05:22,491 --> 00:05:23,334
Rym: Oh, it happened.

91
00:05:23,474 --> 00:05:27,244
Rym: So literally at 10 o'clock or 9 o'clock that night, it happened.

92
00:05:27,284 --> 00:05:28,066
Rym: We're playing a match.

93
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:29,430
Rym: There's like eight people left.

94
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:37,190
Rym: I'm in this like really desperate shotgun fight with what I assume is a 13 year old and our characters start dancing.

95
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:40,690
Scott: And, you know, I bet they were an adult who assumed you were a 13 year old.

96
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:41,031
Rym: Oh, yeah.

97
00:05:41,051 --> 00:05:41,353
Rym: Yeah.

98
00:05:41,373 --> 00:05:41,915
Rym: But you know what?

99
00:05:42,116 --> 00:05:45,590
Rym: While they might assume I'm a 13 year old, I know they're a 13 year old.

100
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:46,429
Scott: Okay.

101
00:05:49,393 --> 00:05:49,693
Rym: But yeah.

102
00:05:49,774 --> 00:05:55,610
Rym: So we're kind of just circling each other because we both know that at some point our shotguns are going to reappear.

103
00:05:56,271 --> 00:05:59,540
Rym: And it was actually a moderately fun, tense moment.

104
00:05:59,961 --> 00:06:03,350
Rym: And I totally shotgunned that kid in the face when the dancing stopped.

105
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,784
Scott: That's enough Tuesday talk on Monday.

106
00:06:05,825 --> 00:06:06,550
Scott: Let's go to the Monday.

107
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,235
Rym: But I thought you were all about the cross-pollination.

108
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:09,338
Rym: There is big news, though.

109
00:06:09,358 --> 00:06:12,647
Rym: There's so much news and we've already forgotten 99 percent of it.

110
00:06:14,111 --> 00:06:14,251
Scott: Yeah.

111
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,776
Scott: Well, let's go to this Monday news.

112
00:06:15,796 --> 00:06:20,910
Scott: that's also not really a tech news other than the involvement of YouTube, which is a tech company kind of.

113
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:21,191
Rym: Yeah.

114
00:06:21,212 --> 00:06:22,621
Rym: I mean, this could be a Tuesday news.

115
00:06:22,641 --> 00:06:23,890
Rym: This could be a Thursday news.

116
00:06:25,392 --> 00:06:25,692
Scott: Yeah.

117
00:06:25,712 --> 00:06:31,285
Scott: But anyway, there's this thing in the United States called the National Football League.

118
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:33,610
Scott: It's a sport that other countries don't have.

119
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:34,651
Scott: Yeah.

120
00:06:35,052 --> 00:06:36,514
Rym: And we're such.

121
00:06:36,614 --> 00:06:47,130
Rym: we're so inward looking in our own sports and our own sports are so big within our country that we just named one of our sports the same name as what you all call the actually biggest sport in the world.

122
00:06:47,911 --> 00:06:48,111
Scott: Right.

123
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:54,844
Scott: But anyway, so this sport is broadcast differently from every other sport because there are.

124
00:06:55,105 --> 00:06:57,710
Scott: it's so violent and so hard on the human body.

125
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:01,410
Scott: There are so few games of it per season.

126
00:07:01,591 --> 00:07:01,973
Scott: Yeah.

127
00:07:01,993 --> 00:07:03,461
Rym: Like baseball, basketball.

128
00:07:03,481 --> 00:07:04,869
Rym: How many games do they play?

129
00:07:06,272 --> 00:07:06,770
Scott: Constantly.

130
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:14,770
Rym: There's like games like every single American football game matters a lot unless you're eliminated.

131
00:07:15,772 --> 00:07:15,993
Scott: Right.

132
00:07:16,234 --> 00:07:19,249
Scott: And then once you're in the playoffs, you basically stop trying because you don't want to get hurt.

133
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,373
Scott: Yeah.

134
00:07:22,495 --> 00:07:26,421
Scott: So what happens is that every football game is a big deal.

135
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:29,045
Scott: And there are a few football games.

136
00:07:29,065 --> 00:07:32,690
Scott: There's a Monday is one game on Monday night during the season, at least.

137
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:32,910
Scott: Right.

138
00:07:32,931 --> 00:07:33,933
Scott: Which is only a few months.

139
00:07:34,013 --> 00:07:40,107
Scott: It runs from like, you know, September, like the autumn through, you know, February, basically.

140
00:07:40,188 --> 00:07:40,809
Scott: And then that's it.

141
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:47,020
Scott: Um, so it's, it's a pretty short season and it's only your teams play once a week.

142
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:52,410
Scott: And then, except they have each team gets one week off for recovery, right?

143
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:53,432
Scott: Somewhere in the season.

144
00:07:53,472 --> 00:07:56,558
Scott: Some, you know, who knows when it's going to be depends on the schedule.

145
00:07:57,119 --> 00:08:03,090
Scott: And then if you make the playoffs, you keep going for a few more games in a little single elimination tournament, which ends in the superb owl.

146
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:03,492
Scott: Right.

147
00:08:04,256 --> 00:08:07,230
Scott: So if you're eliminated, obviously no playoffs.

148
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:13,038
Scott: So if you're, you're playing once a week, there's one game on Monday night, right?

149
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:15,963
Scott: Just one, one, two teams play on Monday night.

150
00:08:16,023 --> 00:08:19,950
Scott: And every team is going to play on Monday night, like once a season, usually right.

151
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,594
Scott: There's a Thursday night game.

152
00:08:22,596 --> 00:08:27,489
Scott: And obviously if you play on Monday or Thursday that week, you're not playing on any of the other nights that week.

153
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:27,930
Rym: Right.

154
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:29,995
Scott: I don't know if they have a Saturday one or not.

155
00:08:30,055 --> 00:08:34,845
Scott: And I don't know if that was a thing at some, there was a thing at some points in time.

156
00:08:34,905 --> 00:08:36,870
Scott: I don't know if it's a thing right now, whatever.

157
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:44,221
Rym: I mean, I used to watch more football, but for the last few years, I watch an average of three football games a year.

158
00:08:44,521 --> 00:08:48,427
Rym: I watch the Super Bowl and I watch like the Thanksgiving Lions game.

159
00:08:48,527 --> 00:08:50,270
Rym: And I like accidentally watch one more game.

160
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:56,402
Scott: On Thanksgiving specifically, on US Thanksgiving specifically, there are three games, right?

161
00:08:56,722 --> 00:08:59,307
Scott: An early afternoon, late afternoon, night game, right?

162
00:08:59,548 --> 00:09:00,670
Scott: Time zone varying.

163
00:09:02,971 --> 00:09:07,358
Scott: There's one Sunday night game a week, and that is like the big game.

164
00:09:07,378 --> 00:09:13,930
Scott: You know, NBC Sunday Night Football is actually the number one primetime television show in the United States.

165
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:14,210
Rym: Yep.

166
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:20,743
Rym: Like look at this, there's a stereotype of American football fans where like they prepare for the game.

167
00:09:20,803 --> 00:09:23,970
Rym: Like the game is a big event and that's kind of like a pop culture thing.

168
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,494
Rym: And there are problems with American football fan culture.

169
00:09:26,534 --> 00:09:28,516
Rym: Like don't think I'm defending it deeply.

170
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:34,906
Rym: But there's a reason why people treat like the big game like a big game.

171
00:09:35,086 --> 00:09:37,750
Rym: Like we don't do that when we watch a hockey game unless it's a playoff game.

172
00:09:38,631 --> 00:09:47,304
Scott: So all those games I just mentioned, those individual games are like these nationally broadcast or cable broadcast, like special games, right?

173
00:09:47,684 --> 00:09:51,690
Scott: That, you know, you have to have whatever thing to be able to watch them, right?

174
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:55,880
Scott: You know, either regular TV or for NBC, it's just nationally broadcast, right?

175
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,143
Scott: Or to think to watch them.

176
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:59,088
Scott: I don't know what channel Monday Night Football is on.

177
00:09:59,108 --> 00:10:00,030
Scott: It used to be on ESPN.

178
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:05,290
Rym: I'm not sure, but I think we could get football OTA in New York pretty easily.

179
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:08,569
Scott: Well, I mean, oh yeah, if it's on one of the major networks, yeah.

180
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:19,530
Scott: But that's the point is that, so the rest of the football games, all the other games that aren't the special game of the week in one of those special slots is on Sunday afternoon.

181
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:23,079
Scott: And there's one o'clock games and there's four o'clock games.

182
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:27,130
Scott: And at the four o'clock games, there's very few four o'clock games.

183
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:35,509
Scott: Those are the games that are hot and they are, uh, like special better games, but they're not hot enough to be the Sunday night game.

184
00:10:35,689 --> 00:10:35,930
Scott: Right.

185
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:40,377
Scott: And there's only a few of the after those four o'clock games, at least Eastern time.

186
00:10:41,018 --> 00:10:44,403
Scott: And those games have like a bit national broadcast, right?

187
00:10:44,423 --> 00:10:49,110
Scott: There's so few of them that you're probably, you know, you got one on Fox and one on CBS.

188
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,855
Scott: It's like you got two to choose from.

189
00:10:51,216 --> 00:10:55,549
Scott: You're going to see them if, and if you just have over the air broadcast television, no cable, no nothing.

190
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:55,870
Scott: Right.

191
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:03,827
Scott: Um, and you know, if there's more, if there's like three or four of them, you're going to be able to see the two that are like closer to where you live, right.

192
00:11:03,927 --> 00:11:05,110
Scott: Based on which teams are playing.

193
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:07,956
Scott: And then one o'clock is every other game.

194
00:11:08,296 --> 00:11:13,970
Scott: Every other game is a one o'clock and you're one o'clock again, you only have two TV channels, Fox and CBS.

195
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:22,262
Scott: So you're only going to see the two one o'clock games, depending on where you live and all the other one o'clock games, you can't see them.

196
00:11:22,462 --> 00:11:23,584
Scott: There's no way to see them.

197
00:11:23,624 --> 00:11:26,729
Scott: You could buy all the cable TV in the world.

198
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:27,590
Scott: Right.

199
00:11:28,051 --> 00:11:36,270
Scott: And you're not going to be able to watch those games that are the one o'clock games that are, or that are not where you live and have teams involved that are not near you.

200
00:11:37,212 --> 00:11:41,279
Scott: And there's maybe a couple four o'clock games that you also won't be able to see.

201
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:41,720
Scott: Right.

202
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:44,185
Scott: And so they sell a thing.

203
00:11:44,305 --> 00:11:46,650
Scott: They sell a thing called the NFL Sunday ticket.

204
00:11:47,251 --> 00:11:56,605
Scott: And if you buy the NFL Sunday ticket with that, you can watch every NFL game that is at one o'clock or four o'clock on Sunday.

205
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:59,249
Scott: That would not be available where you live.

206
00:11:59,790 --> 00:11:59,990
Scott: Right.

207
00:12:00,691 --> 00:12:04,796
Scott: And it costs $300 a year, give or take.

208
00:12:05,137 --> 00:12:06,018
Scott: It's very expensive.

209
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:11,425
Scott: And for the past very long period of time, DirecTV owned it.

210
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:15,650
Scott: So if you wanted the NFL Sunday ticket, you had to buy it from DirecTV because no one else had it.

211
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:20,501
Rym: Now, it says here that to buy it, you want you have to have a DirecTV subscription.

212
00:12:20,521 --> 00:12:24,770
Rym: if you don't use the rest of DirecTV, which is 80 bucks a month.

213
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:25,730
Rym: Yes.

214
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:31,178
Rym: And then you have to pay for a package that apparently cost $150 a month.

215
00:12:31,358 --> 00:12:32,059
Scott: It's a lot of money.

216
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:32,500
Scott: Right.

217
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:35,304
Scott: And the idea is that, you know, who would buy this?

218
00:12:35,485 --> 00:12:39,070
Scott: Someone who really cares about a football team and doesn't live near that football team.

219
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:39,571
Scott: Yeah.

220
00:12:39,691 --> 00:12:45,725
Rym: Which is funny because the opposite, like in the NHL, it's really easy to watch a hockey game if you don't live in the town where that team plays.

221
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:47,530
Rym: But if you live there, you can't fucking see it.

222
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:49,031
Scott: Exactly.

223
00:12:49,051 --> 00:12:56,726
Scott: So whereas in the NFL, it's like if you live near a team, you can just turn on a TV and watch it on Fox CBS with an antenna.

224
00:12:57,909 --> 00:12:58,630
Scott: It's just broadcast.

225
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:09,720
Scott: So this deal, right, that DirecTV made also spawned the birth of perhaps the greatest invention in sports broadcasting, the red zone.

226
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:21,190
Scott: The red zone is basically one channel where there's someone hosting it and they're constantly flipping between all the exciting parts of the one o'clock and four o'clock games.

227
00:13:21,571 --> 00:13:26,539
Scott: So you can't like see the whole game, but you can see the good bits live.

228
00:13:26,699 --> 00:13:29,885
Scott: ish, slightly delayed ish, like curated for you.

229
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:30,586
Rym: It's good.

230
00:13:30,646 --> 00:13:32,569
Rym: It's like watching the best of an F1 race.

231
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:33,630
Scott: Right.

232
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:36,254
Scott: So you don't have the Sunday ticket necessarily.

233
00:13:36,434 --> 00:13:36,614
Scott: Right.

234
00:13:36,654 --> 00:13:38,497
Scott: You might because there's two different red zones, actually.

235
00:13:38,537 --> 00:13:43,404
Scott: The original red zone was a DirecTV red zone hosted by this one guy.

236
00:13:43,424 --> 00:13:44,986
Scott: I forget his name.

237
00:13:45,006 --> 00:13:47,610
Scott: And that red zone was part of the ticket.

238
00:13:48,031 --> 00:13:48,271
Scott: Right.

239
00:13:48,531 --> 00:13:50,274
Scott: So that was the only way to see that red zone.

240
00:13:50,314 --> 00:14:01,130
Scott: But two years later, after that original red zone began, the NFL made its own separate red zone with this different guy named Scott, which is I only know him because his name is Scott.

241
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:08,902
Scott: So and that different red zone that the NFL official one, you can get that one with just cable TV.

242
00:14:09,062 --> 00:14:09,322
Scott: Right.

243
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:14,230
Scott: Or you could even watch it on the Internet if you have cable or you don't need to have the ticket to see that other red zone.

244
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:18,075
Scott: But obviously it doesn't let you watch the whole games.

245
00:14:18,095 --> 00:14:18,235
Scott: Right.

246
00:14:18,295 --> 00:14:19,938
Scott: It's this guy curating for you.

247
00:14:20,338 --> 00:14:20,518
Scott: Right.

248
00:14:20,558 --> 00:14:23,123
Scott: The hot parts like someone's about to score a touchdown.

249
00:14:23,143 --> 00:14:24,024
Scott: Let's go to that game.

250
00:14:24,144 --> 00:14:24,405
Scott: Right.

251
00:14:24,805 --> 00:14:27,870
Scott: But it does cover every game that's happening at one and four o'clock.

252
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,453
Scott: So YouTube is the big news.

253
00:14:31,493 --> 00:14:43,110
Scott: DirecTV was paying one and a half billion billion dollars a year for the rights, the exclusive right to offer this Sunday ticket package since nineteen ninety four.

254
00:14:43,851 --> 00:14:44,051
Scott: Yep.

255
00:14:44,292 --> 00:14:44,993
Scott: For a long time.

256
00:14:46,395 --> 00:14:51,042
Scott: They were losing its estimated five hundred million dollars a year on it.

257
00:14:51,062 --> 00:14:51,643
Scott: So they were only.

258
00:14:51,663 --> 00:14:58,877
Scott: they're spending three X and making back two X. They were losing a third of the money they spent.

259
00:14:59,217 --> 00:15:04,490
Rym: I don't think there was any time where DirecTV was doing well based on memory alone.

260
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:04,710
Rym: Right.

261
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:11,580
Scott: But this is why the first this is the first point to get into to really think about this is why sports.

262
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:12,902
Rym: Right.

263
00:15:13,343 --> 00:15:18,350
Scott: You know, leagues don't want to just sell some direct to consumer streaming deal.

264
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:18,931
Scott: Right.

265
00:15:19,011 --> 00:15:21,935
Scott: Because they're going to lose a third of the money.

266
00:15:22,135 --> 00:15:22,395
Scott: Right.

267
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:27,362
Scott: By having this in between deal that they sign for a set amount.

268
00:15:27,763 --> 00:15:28,003
Scott: Right.

269
00:15:28,243 --> 00:15:33,250
Scott: They can lock in their revenues like a guaranteed number, not have to lose a lot of risk.

270
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:33,630
Rym: Yeah.

271
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:34,972
Rym: Making someone else's problem.

272
00:15:35,052 --> 00:15:39,977
Scott: The league ends up getting way more money than the TV broadcaster gets.

273
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:40,597
Scott: Right.

274
00:15:41,098 --> 00:15:53,450
Scott: If you add up all the money, they make selling ads and doing and subscription fees and all the other money that the TV networks get from the customers and advertisers and subtract the cost of broadcasting.

275
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:59,197
Scott: They the NFL is getting more money than they're actually making.

276
00:15:59,377 --> 00:16:10,350
Rym: And there is a broader problem where when cable TV and advertising start to collapse for real, like when people actually don't pay for cable, but there's deals locked in for a long time.

277
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:14,655
Scott: So the NFL, the sports league is insulated completely from that.

278
00:16:14,675 --> 00:16:14,915
Scott: Right.

279
00:16:14,935 --> 00:16:21,383
Scott: And it's basically at the TV broadcasters, the Fox's, the CBS's, the NBC's, the direct TV's, the YouTube's.

280
00:16:21,724 --> 00:16:22,745
Scott: They're taking the hit.

281
00:16:22,785 --> 00:16:27,130
Scott: They're basically just spending their money to keep the sport going.

282
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:27,911
Scott: Now, why?

283
00:16:27,951 --> 00:16:30,633
Rym: Why would they keep spending completely subsidizing?

284
00:16:30,673 --> 00:16:33,315
Rym: You're probably all thinking, why are they spending that money?

285
00:16:33,435 --> 00:16:38,819
Rym: And really, the answer is partly that it feels like you should be able to make money off of sports.

286
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:41,401
Rym: Like it seems like it'd be a really easy thing to do.

287
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,363
Rym: But historically, that's actually not super true.

288
00:16:44,743 --> 00:16:54,150
Rym: And I think a lot of cultural traditions and expectations drive it more than the reality of how the money comes in, coupled with various bubbles and things like advertising.

289
00:16:54,691 --> 00:17:02,541
Rym: It is possible that American sports as we know it could not exist once this subsidy disappears.

290
00:17:02,782 --> 00:17:05,866
Scott: Or at least could not exist at the budgets that they have now.

291
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:08,849
Rym: Like budgets are going to contract and play might get worse.

292
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,272
Scott: I mean, like you look at European hockey.

293
00:17:11,292 --> 00:17:12,996
Scott: Look how many ads just all over the ice.

294
00:17:13,036 --> 00:17:14,017
Scott: You know, European soccer.

295
00:17:14,037 --> 00:17:15,940
Scott: Look at the ads are all over the NHL.

296
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,882
Rym: They got fucking ads on the jerseys now.

297
00:17:18,522 --> 00:17:19,243
Scott: Only one, though.

298
00:17:19,384 --> 00:17:19,565
Scott: Yeah.

299
00:17:19,585 --> 00:17:22,288
Scott: It's not like it's only some team.

300
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:23,270
Rym: Once you let one in.

301
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,791
Scott: It's well, you know, it's anyway.

302
00:17:26,393 --> 00:17:33,261
Scott: So YouTube has purchased the Sunday ticket and that which means now from starting, I guess, next season, right?

303
00:17:33,381 --> 00:17:33,601
Scott: Yeah.

304
00:17:33,801 --> 00:17:37,746
Scott: If you want to watch the Sunday ticket deal, you're going to have to buy it from YouTube.

305
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:41,330
Scott: And they haven't given out details of what it's going to cost or anything.

306
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,372
Rym: But it's not just free with YouTube.

307
00:17:44,254 --> 00:17:57,470
Scott: No, presumably what it's going to be is that you can either a just buy it outright, which is probably going to cost hundreds of dollars and then watch it on YouTube or B, you'll get YouTube TV.

308
00:17:58,311 --> 00:17:58,491
Scott: Right.

309
00:17:58,531 --> 00:18:00,252
Scott: Which is an existing service they have.

310
00:18:00,773 --> 00:18:05,217
Scott: And then you will pay an extra fee to add it on to YouTube TV.

311
00:18:05,237 --> 00:18:05,778
Scott: Right.

312
00:18:06,158 --> 00:18:18,090
Scott: So YouTube is definitely hoping that the fact this exists will bring in YouTube TV subscribers doesn't have, you know, and YouTube is spending more money on it than direct TV did.

313
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,433
Scott: So I don't know how they're going to make.

314
00:18:20,954 --> 00:18:25,360
Scott: also direct TV didn't even drag TV was losing a third of the money they spent.

315
00:18:25,461 --> 00:18:28,245
Scott: Is YouTube going to lose half the money they spent on this deal?

316
00:18:28,485 --> 00:18:31,910
Rym: Direct TV did not even bid on a renewal at any price.

317
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:32,951
Scott: No.

318
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:33,532
Scott: Why would they?

319
00:18:33,552 --> 00:18:35,315
Scott: They're like, we're going to get out.

320
00:18:35,335 --> 00:18:37,318
Rym: There's other bidders like Apple.

321
00:18:37,438 --> 00:18:41,284
Scott: Apple was going in on it and all the everyone was going in on it.

322
00:18:41,344 --> 00:18:42,346
Scott: But then they all pulled out.

323
00:18:42,386 --> 00:18:44,990
Scott: And I guess Google ended up being the winner winner.

324
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:53,298
Rym: We'll see how this goes, because I think there has been a decline in interest in NFL football.

325
00:18:53,318 --> 00:18:54,699
Scott: I don't know.

326
00:18:54,739 --> 00:18:57,142
Scott: But I think, you know, the point is a right.

327
00:18:57,362 --> 00:19:03,950
Scott: that original red zone, you know, with the with the guy, I can't remember his name, the direct TV red zone that what it's gone now.

328
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,772
Scott: It's going to well, it's going to finish out the season.

329
00:19:05,832 --> 00:19:07,033
Scott: But after this season, that's it.

330
00:19:07,154 --> 00:19:13,501
Scott: It's over that, you know, the really revolutionary television innovation is just going to the end.

331
00:19:13,961 --> 00:19:18,967
Scott: And the other one, the other red zone with the Scott guy, that one's going to be the only red zone.

332
00:19:19,147 --> 00:19:21,610
Scott: And I guess you'll be able to see it if you get the YouTube deal.

333
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:22,391
Rym: No, you won't.

334
00:19:22,431 --> 00:19:31,623
Rym: So NFL media is not included, quote, the deal with YouTube TV does not include a stake in NFL media, which includes the linear cable channels, NFL Network and Red Zone, as well as NFL dot com.

335
00:19:32,184 --> 00:19:34,227
Rym: All the ancillary stuff is not part of this.

336
00:19:34,567 --> 00:19:36,570
Rym: Like it is just the games, from what I can tell.

337
00:19:37,171 --> 00:19:38,753
Scott: OK, well, I guess you're still.

338
00:19:38,793 --> 00:19:45,482
Scott: the point is that other red zone, the Scott one is going to keep going and it'll exist for someone to see somewhere.

339
00:19:45,502 --> 00:19:49,948
Rym: Apparently the NFL is still looking for a partner for NFL media and no one's taking him up on it.

340
00:19:49,968 --> 00:19:51,329
Scott: I don't know.

341
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:51,650
Scott: But.

342
00:19:53,751 --> 00:20:05,090
Scott: Yes, it's all fascinating because there's definitely there might be a fascinating because it's like, you know, some of it applies to, you know, all of you know, it's like there's lessons to see here for all these other people.

343
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:10,910
Scott: But it's also a unique situation because the NFL is different from all the other sports in the way it's broadcast.

344
00:20:11,231 --> 00:20:14,516
Rym: It also shines a light on a long term conversation around.

345
00:20:15,238 --> 00:20:22,070
Rym: should a platform like YouTube really embrace just being the technology platform for people who provide content but don't actually stream themselves?

346
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:29,763
Rym: Because we've seen most of the streaming services are not making money and they've all started to collapse like really rapidly.

347
00:20:30,144 --> 00:20:33,630
Rym: And two, most of the other streaming services suck.

348
00:20:34,051 --> 00:20:42,024
Rym: Like Apple TV, when we try to watch it on our TV, like on a Windows computer, every third time we start a video, it just doesn't load.

349
00:20:42,044 --> 00:20:43,347
Rym: We have to keep refreshing like.

350
00:20:43,587 --> 00:20:45,250
Scott: it only works nice if you have Apple device.

351
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:45,970
Rym: Exactly.

352
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:53,567
Rym: And Paramount Plus, like if you skip the intro to a show, like you don't want to watch the opening, it also skips like the first 10 minutes of the show.

353
00:20:53,847 --> 00:20:55,050
Rym: And the UX is just garbage.

354
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:57,053
Rym: And also sometimes the things don't load.

355
00:20:57,354 --> 00:21:03,664
Rym: And if something's airing live, you can't watch like you can't rewind until after the live is complete.

356
00:21:03,684 --> 00:21:06,950
Rym: There's all these just really bad UX and platform decisions.

357
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:09,935
Rym: Very few of the streaming platforms work that well.

358
00:21:10,255 --> 00:21:13,342
Scott: But YouTube, the Google ones and the Amazons work well.

359
00:21:14,103 --> 00:21:17,390
Scott: And then the Apple, the Apple one works well if you have Apple devices.

360
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:21,410
Rym: It's just amazing how poorly Apple TV works on a Windows PC and a browser.

361
00:21:22,094 --> 00:21:24,870
Scott: I mean, all Apple things work poorly on Windows.

362
00:21:25,412 --> 00:21:27,690
Rym: We only have Apple TV to watch Ted Lasso anyway.

363
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:37,850
Scott: The Windows iCloud stuff is so bad that Microsoft had to work with Apple and Microsoft made the best iCloud photo thing for Windows.

364
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:42,219
Scott: It's like because Apple just doesn't try and they don't care about it.

365
00:21:42,239 --> 00:21:47,190
Scott: They just keep it like at the bare minimum investment and existence because it's intentional.

366
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:47,471
Scott: Right.

367
00:21:47,511 --> 00:21:58,270
Scott: As they want you to be able to, you know, it's like, yes, you know, if you have iPhones, if you have iPads, you want and you don't have Macs, we still want you to be able to do that because and have the minimum functionality.

368
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:01,717
Scott: Otherwise, you'll switch to Android because it just doesn't work.

369
00:22:02,298 --> 00:22:07,110
Scott: But B, we don't want to make it too good because you really want to encourage you to get a Mac.

370
00:22:07,491 --> 00:22:07,753
Rym: Yeah.

371
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,910
Scott: So they just keep it at that bare minimum level.

372
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:11,971
Scott: Yeah.

373
00:22:11,991 --> 00:22:22,450
Rym: And in general, I think we're going to see sports just try to milk as much money out of the previous system as they can, because over the next five to 10 years, that old ecosystem is going to collapse.

374
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:29,310
Rym: And they got to put feelers out for how to continue to do their sports in an era where like cable TV disappears.

375
00:22:30,012 --> 00:22:38,350
Scott: I mean, the you know, the prevailing thing that I see is that people who want to watch sports, they want to pay and they want to pay for something high quality.

376
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:41,237
Rym: And I really pay a lot if it works.

377
00:22:41,338 --> 00:22:42,962
Rym: But like NHL, you want to watch hockey?

378
00:22:43,424 --> 00:22:45,550
Rym: There's really nothing you can pay for except cable TV.

379
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:46,011
Scott: Right.

380
00:22:46,292 --> 00:22:50,590
Scott: But the problem is, even if the leagues provided something that was good.

381
00:22:51,111 --> 00:22:51,351
Scott: Right.

382
00:22:51,632 --> 00:22:53,655
Scott: And they charged money for it.

383
00:22:54,337 --> 00:23:01,810
Scott: It's like the price that they would have to charge right to meet the revenues that they have now.

384
00:23:02,371 --> 00:23:02,531
Scott: Right.

385
00:23:02,551 --> 00:23:10,529
Scott: It's like, look, the direct that we're just talking about this friggin Sunday ticket to get it from DirecTV costs hundreds of dollars per month or whatever year.

386
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:11,671
Rym: Oh, damn.

387
00:23:11,711 --> 00:23:14,218
Rym: YouTube doesn't even have the advertising rights.

388
00:23:15,662 --> 00:23:16,564
Rym: YouTube won't make money.

389
00:23:16,644 --> 00:23:16,965
Rym: I like that.

390
00:23:17,025 --> 00:23:18,710
Rym: YouTube is not going to sell the ad inventory.

391
00:23:19,711 --> 00:23:20,072
Scott: I don't know.

392
00:23:20,172 --> 00:23:22,698
Scott: But the point is, it seems like a terrible deal for YouTube.

393
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:23,841
Scott: I don't know.

394
00:23:24,121 --> 00:23:24,462
Scott: I don't know.

395
00:23:24,502 --> 00:23:27,730
Scott: They're just trying to get by YouTube TV subscribers, I guess.

396
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:33,741
Rym: I think YouTube is trying to buy eyeballs and be one of the last players standing.

397
00:23:33,781 --> 00:23:38,090
Rym: I think YouTube, Netflix, Amazon are trying to like be the last ones to survive.

398
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:39,615
Rym: Disney plus might go away.

399
00:23:39,696 --> 00:23:40,680
Rym: Paramount's not doing well.

400
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,107
Rym: Nothing's doing well except those three.

401
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:50,350
Scott: But yeah, it's like the amount that you have to pay for the services as they exist, which are being subsidized by the broadcaster.

402
00:23:51,051 --> 00:23:51,331
Scott: Right.

403
00:23:51,612 --> 00:23:59,250
Scott: So if you were to get a really good streaming service and that was the only way the broadcasting was gone, the price you would have to pay.

404
00:23:59,730 --> 00:23:59,951
Scott: Right.

405
00:24:00,151 --> 00:24:06,963
Scott: That one and a half to two billion dollars that Apple is that YouTube is paying divided amongst all.

406
00:24:07,343 --> 00:24:11,450
Scott: take two billion and divide it amongst all the people who want to watch football.

407
00:24:12,113 --> 00:24:15,446
Scott: It's like how much was that each person going to have to pay a year?

408
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:16,330
Scott: A thousand dollars?

409
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:20,938
Rym: Almost like most good, complex things only exist with heavy subsidy.

410
00:24:20,978 --> 00:24:27,090
Rym: And that subsidy can either come from the capital markets or governments or individual wealthy people.

411
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:35,510
Scott: And also the causality goes in the reverse direction, which is like if something is subsidized, it has a high chance of success.

412
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,593
Rym: Speaking of things that are subsidized.

413
00:24:37,713 --> 00:24:39,416
Rym: So this is actually a really good segue.

414
00:24:40,438 --> 00:24:48,110
Rym: There is a project that is kicking off near New York on the New Jersey Turnpike, which we don't know if you drive anywhere near New York City.

415
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:51,516
Scott: Like if you're not going to New Jersey, Turnpike is I-95.

416
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:52,257
Scott: Right.

417
00:24:52,358 --> 00:24:57,187
Scott: A major the major north south interstate that can take you from the top of the U.S.

418
00:24:57,227 --> 00:24:58,810
Scott: to the bottom along the East Coast.

419
00:24:59,351 --> 00:25:01,535
Scott: It is an enormous, important road.

420
00:25:01,555 --> 00:25:03,319
Rym: It's a nightmare.

421
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:09,050
Scott: It's a gristmill of only officially 100 percent completed somewhat recently.

422
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:14,398
Rym: So, of course, it's completely clogged with cars and has been forever.

423
00:25:14,518 --> 00:25:16,502
Scott: And it's mostly cars.

424
00:25:16,602 --> 00:25:20,190
Scott: actually try to avoid 95 whenever possible because it's filled with trucks.

425
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:20,570
Rym: Yep.

426
00:25:20,831 --> 00:25:22,134
Rym: But there's no way even to get through.

427
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:28,190
Rym: because if you drive, if you've ever never driven near New York City, I didn't even know this was a thing until I moved out this way.

428
00:25:28,711 --> 00:25:32,720
Rym: So like in most places, you'll have a highway that goes by a tap by a city.

429
00:25:33,241 --> 00:25:37,530
Rym: And there's probably like another highway that splits off and goes into the downtown.

430
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:40,976
Rym: Another city like loops around the city near New York City.

431
00:25:41,417 --> 00:25:42,620
Rym: It's almost like a black hole.

432
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:47,950
Rym: Like it has so much gravity that every highway and freeway in the area kind of bends toward it.

433
00:25:48,391 --> 00:25:53,161
Rym: And there's no way to just drive around New York City without going like 100 miles out of your way.

434
00:25:53,221 --> 00:25:57,230
Rym: Like you're going to be stuck in New York City traffic even if you're not going to touch New York City.

435
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:04,150
Rym: So the New Jersey Turnpike, they are planning to widen it and extend it significantly.

436
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:09,310
Scott: Which, as we know, because of induced demand, will not improve the situation.

437
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:13,516
Rym: It will literally make traffic worse and not make drive times better.

438
00:26:13,536 --> 00:26:16,821
Rym: Like it will not cause any positive outcome at all.

439
00:26:17,482 --> 00:26:22,810
Rym: And even if it could, it doesn't matter because a big part of that traffic is people don't get into like the tunnels.

440
00:26:23,311 --> 00:26:24,392
Rym: They can't wind the tunnels.

441
00:26:24,893 --> 00:26:26,615
Rym: So what are you going to do?

442
00:26:27,076 --> 00:26:33,025
Rym: But this project is now officially going to cost $1.1 billion per mile.

443
00:26:37,391 --> 00:26:39,154
Scott: So they could take two miles of this.

444
00:26:39,334 --> 00:26:43,141
Scott: Instead, it could decrease this project by two miles.

445
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:43,842
Scott: Right?

446
00:26:43,922 --> 00:26:47,088
Scott: Just take two miles that you were going to add a lane to.

447
00:26:47,469 --> 00:26:47,950
Scott: Just don't.

448
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:52,476
Scott: Take that money and give everyone in the whole country free NFL football.

449
00:26:53,898 --> 00:26:54,739
Rym: You know what?

450
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:56,681
Rym: If you did that, you would never lose an election.

451
00:26:57,262 --> 00:26:58,063
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

452
00:26:58,163 --> 00:26:59,585
Scott: People are so stupid.

453
00:26:59,645 --> 00:27:00,506
Rym: The Romans do this.

454
00:27:00,627 --> 00:27:01,788
Rym: Bread circuses.

455
00:27:01,868 --> 00:27:03,110
Rym: That's the circus right there.

456
00:27:05,031 --> 00:27:14,887
Scott: Instead of increasing the width of this one highway by two miles of the highway, you could give free NFL football to the entire country with no ads.

457
00:27:15,127 --> 00:27:16,930
Scott: That's the amount of money that they're spending.

458
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:24,418
Rym: So again, we are subsidizing expanding this road to solve no problems.

459
00:27:25,499 --> 00:27:27,942
Scott: Well, they believe they're solving a problem, but I don't know.

460
00:27:27,962 --> 00:27:30,184
Scott: Is there something we don't know?

461
00:27:30,204 --> 00:27:30,865
Scott: Because we're just.

462
00:27:30,885 --> 00:27:32,026
Scott: we're not civil engineers.

463
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:36,271
Scott: Right.

464
00:27:36,311 --> 00:27:50,528
Scott: But it's like everything I see online from other people who are civil engineers and experts and books and YouTube videos all about roads and engineering and city design and urbanism, they all talk about induced demand and how.

465
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:52,410
Scott: it's a fact and his studies that prove it.

466
00:27:52,711 --> 00:27:57,482
Scott: And it's like, did no Department of Transportation in the world get the message?

467
00:27:57,562 --> 00:27:59,106
Scott: Like, what is up with that?

468
00:27:59,166 --> 00:28:00,750
Scott: Aren't those people also experts?

469
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:18,510
Rym: If you don't create induced demand as population grows, people cannot travel and things start to break down in other ways because our country will never have the conversation of instead of building X road, build Y literally fucking anything.

470
00:28:19,351 --> 00:28:19,511
Scott: Yep.

471
00:28:20,072 --> 00:28:26,180
Rym: A train, a train that carries cars like I don't even care that literally build anything.

472
00:28:26,961 --> 00:28:30,325
Rym: But that's that this project's probably going to happen.

473
00:28:30,426 --> 00:28:32,368
Rym: It's going to solve almost no problems.

474
00:28:32,649 --> 00:28:33,710
Rym: It's going to cost a ton of money.

475
00:28:34,251 --> 00:28:42,786
Rym: And if the cable companies subsidize football for no good reason, because apparently they don't make any money, taxpayers are going to subsidize this stupid road to no end.

476
00:28:43,387 --> 00:28:44,890
Scott: At least it's New Jersey taxpayers.

477
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:45,030
Scott: Yeah.

478
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:46,813
Scott: Actually, I don't know.

479
00:28:46,853 --> 00:28:48,656
Scott: Is it New Jersey taxes or federal taxes?

480
00:28:48,776 --> 00:28:49,177
Scott: Pretty sure.

481
00:28:49,197 --> 00:28:51,541
Scott: a lot of I-95 is an interstate.

482
00:28:51,601 --> 00:28:51,981
Scott: Pretty sure.

483
00:28:52,001 --> 00:28:56,669
Rym: Well, interstates get funded by the states by and large.

484
00:28:56,949 --> 00:28:57,490
Rym: That's a gross.

485
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:00,433
Scott: The states also get money from the Federal Highway, whatever.

486
00:29:00,473 --> 00:29:04,699
Rym: Yeah, but they get that money based on whether or not they follow certain rules because the Supreme Court is stupid.

487
00:29:04,779 --> 00:29:10,466
Rym: So as a result, there are some rules that the feds have stated, but they can't actually enforce.

488
00:29:10,747 --> 00:29:13,250
Rym: so they can enforce them indirectly by withholding funding.

489
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,391
Rym: It's all stupid.

490
00:29:14,831 --> 00:29:15,192
Rym: It's like.

491
00:29:15,252 --> 00:29:17,013
Rym: anyway, the more you read about it, the stupider it is.

492
00:29:17,674 --> 00:29:19,876
Scott: Well, nothing I could do about it, but sigh.

493
00:29:20,096 --> 00:29:20,356
Rym: Yeah.

494
00:29:20,436 --> 00:29:21,837
Rym: And complain and demand trains.

495
00:29:28,423 --> 00:29:31,906
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

496
00:29:32,026 --> 00:29:33,548
Rym: So I think this is cool.

497
00:29:33,908 --> 00:29:36,030
Rym: And it's sad that so many people are terrified of this.

498
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:43,615
Rym: A dude in Australia, a Huntsman spider got into his house and he just kept it like a pet.

499
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:45,116
Rym: He just let it live in his house.

500
00:29:45,136 --> 00:29:47,278
Rym: This giant foot like foot wide spider.

501
00:29:47,678 --> 00:29:49,660
Scott: Well, it's not a dangerous one.

502
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,921
Rym: No, they're not dangerous.

503
00:29:51,401 --> 00:29:53,403
Rym: And people are like, why did you do this?

504
00:29:53,463 --> 00:29:53,923
Rym: It's crazy.

505
00:29:53,943 --> 00:29:55,344
Rym: He's like, look, I named it Charlotte's.

506
00:29:55,364 --> 00:29:56,645
Rym: My kid's not afraid of it anymore.

507
00:29:57,306 --> 00:29:59,248
Rym: And it eats the cockroaches.

508
00:29:59,488 --> 00:30:00,869
Rym: It's actually saving me a ton of money.

509
00:30:00,909 --> 00:30:02,370
Rym: This spider is great.

510
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:05,392
Rym: I hope this spider stays in my house for the rest of its life.

511
00:30:05,612 --> 00:30:08,714
Scott: And when it dies, an Australian person, of course, they have this attitude.

512
00:30:08,854 --> 00:30:10,756
Rym: I mean, that's a good attitude to have, though.

513
00:30:11,676 --> 00:30:14,118
Rym: Kind of like if you don't like, I still wouldn't.

514
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:19,181
Scott: The thing is, even if you know, I know it's not a dangerous spider, but it's real big.

515
00:30:19,241 --> 00:30:20,042
Scott: It's like crab.

516
00:30:20,302 --> 00:30:21,243
Scott: It's a crab big.

517
00:30:21,323 --> 00:30:21,543
Scott: Right.

518
00:30:21,563 --> 00:30:23,804
Scott: And it's like a crab isn't really going to hurt me.

519
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:24,305
Scott: What can they do?

520
00:30:24,365 --> 00:30:24,825
Scott: Pinch me.

521
00:30:24,905 --> 00:30:25,125
Scott: Right.

522
00:30:25,165 --> 00:30:26,586
Scott: It's like, but I'm still not going to let it.

523
00:30:26,606 --> 00:30:30,209
Rym: You know, you might be pooping and he's just like up on the ceiling, just looking at you, just hanging out.

524
00:30:30,229 --> 00:30:31,790
Scott: I'm not going to have a crab in my house.

525
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:32,070
Scott: Right.

526
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:35,873
Scott: Even if it even if it eats cockroaches or whatever, because here's another question.

527
00:30:36,153 --> 00:30:41,356
Rym: What if you had cockroaches like lots of them move, move, move?

528
00:30:41,376 --> 00:30:42,637
Scott: That's another.

529
00:30:42,677 --> 00:30:43,798
Rym: Where's that Jon Stewart thing?

530
00:30:43,818 --> 00:30:46,139
Rym: If you live in New York City at some point, you'll have cockroaches.

531
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,161
Rym: I'm rich and I have cockroaches.

532
00:30:48,361 --> 00:30:52,904
Rym: There's no amount of money that will avoid cockroaches in the places that I have lived.

533
00:30:53,004 --> 00:30:54,285
Rym: I've never had a cockroach, though.

534
00:30:54,345 --> 00:30:57,927
Scott: So I have only ever encountered already dead cockroaches.

535
00:30:58,127 --> 00:31:01,890
Scott: We've there when we first like in the toilet, like, you know, they go to the water.

536
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:02,310
Scott: Right.

537
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,751
Scott: And then they die when our buildings.

538
00:31:03,771 --> 00:31:05,633
Scott: I've never seen a live one skittering.

539
00:31:05,693 --> 00:31:09,296
Rym: I saw a dead one in the building once and that was the only one I've ever seen.

540
00:31:11,517 --> 00:31:13,879
Rym: So what do you got?

541
00:31:13,899 --> 00:31:15,601
Scott: Oh, so what do I got?

542
00:31:15,901 --> 00:31:16,281
Scott: All right.

543
00:31:16,361 --> 00:31:20,144
Scott: So there's this, you know, different CPUs out in the world.

544
00:31:20,244 --> 00:31:21,265
Scott: Go back to Monday here.

545
00:31:21,285 --> 00:31:21,565
Scott: Right.

546
00:31:21,886 --> 00:31:25,308
Scott: Have different assembly languages, different instruction set architectures.

547
00:31:25,989 --> 00:31:27,590
Scott: And there's a recent ish one.

548
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:32,093
Scott: You know, I mean, recent, at least as far as CPU instructions that architectures go.

549
00:31:32,093 --> 00:31:34,415
Scott: 2010, I think, is when they first revealed it.

550
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:34,715
Scott: Right.

551
00:31:35,676 --> 00:31:38,438
Scott: And it was designed by professors at Berkeley.

552
00:31:38,478 --> 00:31:39,498
Scott: It's called RISC-V.

553
00:31:39,999 --> 00:31:40,299
Scott: Right.

554
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:41,540
Scott: A RISC-V.

555
00:31:42,921 --> 00:31:43,741
Scott: And so what happened?

556
00:31:43,862 --> 00:31:50,606
Scott: over time, over the past decade, decade plus, RISC-V actually became kind of the hotness.

557
00:31:50,726 --> 00:31:50,867
Scott: Right.

558
00:31:50,887 --> 00:31:55,750
Scott: I mean, in terms of the commercial world, x86 and ARM are the hotness.

559
00:31:56,011 --> 00:31:56,211
Scott: Right.

560
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:57,515
Scott: ARM even more so.

561
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:02,910
Scott: But basically, RISC-V is like really coming up and making waves.

562
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:08,376
Scott: Like, and it seems like every other day I'm seeing more and more RISC-V hotness.

563
00:32:08,436 --> 00:32:10,320
Scott: We got RISC-V laptops coming out.

564
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:10,660
Scott: Right.

565
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,361
Scott: And we got all kinds.

566
00:32:11,401 --> 00:32:16,570
Scott: So it's like and it's an open, you know, it's an open architecture, like, you know, licensing wise.

567
00:32:17,231 --> 00:32:22,916
Scott: So this I think if there's anything that has a chance of like challenging ARM, it's RISC-V.

568
00:32:23,537 --> 00:32:36,590
Scott: And so I discovered this thing of the day, just project on GitHub called Ripes, which is basically this amazing like RISC simulator sort of thing.

569
00:32:37,211 --> 00:32:52,510
Scott: And like, like I've never I've seen simulators before, but like this one is like showing you like what's like literally the the the schematic of the CPU, like lighting up in real time while your instructions run.

570
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:53,371
Rym: This is nuts.

571
00:32:53,411 --> 00:32:56,958
Rym: There was software I used when I went to community college in like early high school.

572
00:32:57,219 --> 00:33:03,190
Rym: I took a class on systems architecture just for funsies and they made us use a simulator of like a really simple microcontroller.

573
00:33:03,491 --> 00:33:05,898
Rym: We could write instructions and it would do this kind of animation.

574
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:09,910
Rym: But this was a microcontroller that had like eight registers.

575
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:11,211
Scott: Right.

576
00:33:11,251 --> 00:33:18,090
Scott: And this is showing you all like, you know, the stuff that, you know, would be the stuff that's usually invisible to a programmer.

577
00:33:18,311 --> 00:33:18,471
Scott: Right.

578
00:33:18,511 --> 00:33:24,250
Scott: Things like, you know, the cache lookups and the instructions being executed ahead of time.

579
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:31,470
Scott: And, you know, all the optimist compiler optimizations, you can put in some C code and it shows you the assembly code it goes with.

580
00:33:31,651 --> 00:33:33,722
Scott: And it's like, you know, this is really.

581
00:33:33,742 --> 00:33:35,090
Scott: this is really something.

582
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:40,450
Scott: And this is the kind of thing that you can get when you have an open source instruction set architecture.

583
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:42,710
Scott: It's cool stuff.

584
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:52,550
Scott: So, yeah, if you are looking to get into systems programming, either you're still young and you want it to be a career or you're just a nerd, you must be right.

585
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:55,949
Scott: RISC-V is definitely what I would recommend getting into.

586
00:33:58,191 --> 00:34:03,585
Rym: In the meantime, the GeekNights Book Club book, Alif the Unseen, probably right after.

587
00:34:03,746 --> 00:34:05,290
Rym: I have not finished it, but I will shortly.

588
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:11,969
Rym: As soon as I get back from that Colorado ski trip to Vail, so probably the last week of January, we'll do the show.

589
00:34:13,811 --> 00:34:18,150
Rym: Because next week I'm going to be in Frankfurt for work and then we'll do another week of shows.

590
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:22,770
Rym: And then I'm going to disappear again to go skiing at Vail for a week and then we'll be back.

591
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:25,009
Rym: And then I don't know what else we got going on.

592
00:34:25,489 --> 00:34:29,030
Scott: I think I've seen all there is to see in Alif the Unseen.

593
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:29,551
Rym: Yeah.

594
00:34:29,571 --> 00:34:31,489
Rym: So you're going to read the other book by this author?

595
00:34:33,435 --> 00:34:33,688
Scott: Probably.

596
00:34:34,853 --> 00:34:36,889
Rym: I got to make time to read The World We Make.

597
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:41,549
Scott: I'm reading The World We Make and it's going along much quicker than I think it's.

598
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:51,210
Scott: Since I have the e-book, I don't actually know how thick the real book is, but I feel like it's not a thick book because I'm moving right along percentage wise, according to the Kindel.

599
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:55,230
Rym: I'm pretty sure I'm going to finish Alif the Unseen on my flight home from Frankfurt.

600
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,947
Rym: So maybe we'll even do the show that week.

601
00:34:57,911 --> 00:34:59,469
Rym: Unless something really gets in my way.

602
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:01,249
Scott: Is there a Thursday episode that week?

603
00:35:02,553 --> 00:35:03,930
Rym: No, I think that's another Monday, Wednesday.

604
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:04,898
Scott: Okay.

605
00:35:07,531 --> 00:35:13,670
Rym: Otherwise, we'll likely be at PAX East doing like a panel or two, but don't expect us to be like hanging out at the con.

606
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:14,748
Rym: Still a little early for that.

607
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:19,350
Rym: And otherwise, all our plans are up in the air and we don't know what conventions will look like.

608
00:35:19,631 --> 00:35:24,249
Rym: It's very early in twenty twenty three and we just got to play this all by ear for the time being.

609
00:35:25,851 --> 00:35:26,849
Rym: Websites coming along.

610
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:33,550
Rym: You might have noticed I finally updated our streaming template to remove Twitter IDs and make them just our names and sort of simplify it.

611
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:38,750
Rym: I am working on a better streaming pipeline and it's kind of an aside, but I'll mention it to all of you now.

612
00:35:39,771 --> 00:35:45,430
Rym: If you make podcasts and you use Adobe like we do, you know, our whole pipeline is an audition and OBS.

613
00:35:46,011 --> 00:35:47,710
Rym: You should check out the Adobe podcast.

614
00:35:47,971 --> 00:35:52,050
Rym: It's not in production yet, like it's not live, but I've poked at some of the beta features.

615
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:54,109
Rym: Holy shit, is it good?

616
00:35:54,770 --> 00:36:03,330
Rym: Like it solves the few problems we have with GeekNights, like the annoyance of recording over discord and synchronizing audio or having like guests call into the show.

617
00:36:04,072 --> 00:36:08,350
Rym: And it does something that I'm going to review in a future Monday episode.

618
00:36:09,012 --> 00:36:13,610
Rym: It has a an AI driven, make your podcast sound better filter.

619
00:36:14,352 --> 00:36:14,935
Rym: And I tried it.

620
00:36:15,378 --> 00:36:17,530
Rym: I tried testing it with a bunch of old GeekNights episodes.

621
00:36:19,573 --> 00:36:24,470
Rym: And for someone who does good recording, like if you have real professional equipment, it doesn't really do anything for you.

622
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:30,450
Rym: Like GeekNights won't sound different if we use it because we have really expensive, nice equipment and I have a really good pipeline.

623
00:36:30,992 --> 00:36:36,010
Rym: But if you say don't have three hundred dollar microphones, it'll make you sound like a pro on the radio.

624
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:37,409
Rym: It is it is nuts.

625
00:36:38,091 --> 00:36:43,090
Scott: And it's literally just like upload your MP3 and push, maybe push one button and then push you back.

626
00:36:43,571 --> 00:36:44,449
Scott: I made a podcast.

627
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:49,299
Rym: It makes a transcript of all the people on the podcast, all the words they said.

628
00:36:49,539 --> 00:36:54,770
Rym: you can edit it like by changing text and it'll like try to fill in up to a point.

629
00:36:55,031 --> 00:36:56,170
Rym: It is really not.

630
00:36:56,290 --> 00:37:03,289
Rym: So GeekNights, once this goes live, will probably start publishing like full transcripts and text of the show, which is something I always wanted to do.

631
00:37:04,791 --> 00:37:14,930
Rym: But the not so test is I took an extremely fucked up audio sample, like something that would take me a whole day to like make sound really good.

632
00:37:15,472 --> 00:37:16,237
Rym: And I spent.

633
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,163
Scott: I let it.

634
00:37:17,404 --> 00:37:18,410
Rym: I let it do the process.

635
00:37:18,511 --> 00:37:19,727
Rym: It took it 11 minutes to do it.

636
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:26,990
Rym: And then I spent 11 minutes trying to clean it up using my professional audio engineering knowledge.

637
00:37:27,671 --> 00:37:32,510
Rym: It did better than me in those 11 minutes by a wide margin.

638
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:33,929
Scott: 11 minutes isn't that long, right?

639
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:35,459
Rym: Yeah, but 11 minutes is like.

640
00:37:35,499 --> 00:37:36,748
Rym: it doesn't take me that long to do this.

641
00:37:38,431 --> 00:37:40,909
Rym: It would have to make to do it as well as the A.I.

642
00:37:40,949 --> 00:37:41,070
Rym: did.

643
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:47,670
Rym: It would have taken me I would estimate eight to 10 hours on that on that file to do what the A.I.

644
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:51,690
Scott: I wonder how long it would have taken like a professional audio engineer, like the music studio.

645
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:57,230
Rym: My gut feeling is four ish hours because you would had to do the equivalent of some audio rotoscoping.

646
00:37:58,431 --> 00:38:02,630
Rym: You would have had to like applied filters to different parts of the audio at different times.

647
00:38:03,111 --> 00:38:03,493
Rym: What the A.I.

648
00:38:03,574 --> 00:38:06,890
Rym: is good at is handling like transient, weird effects that you don't.

649
00:38:07,412 --> 00:38:09,210
Rym: Anyway, I don't want to derail the whole show with that.

650
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:10,091
Scott: All right.

651
00:38:10,111 --> 00:38:16,550
Scott: So Microsoft Windows, the world's number one desktop operating system isn't the world's number one computer operating system.

652
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:24,570
Scott: It's just the one that people use mostly for desktop computers, something like 70 percent of desktop computers in the world still use Windows.

653
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:32,530
Scott: And although the the so the slice of the pie that Microsoft has has always been enormous, but the pie is shrinking.

654
00:38:32,934 --> 00:38:34,590
Scott: That's a topic for another day.

655
00:38:34,691 --> 00:38:36,229
Scott: And also we've talked about that in the past.

656
00:38:36,771 --> 00:38:40,930
Scott: Regardless, we've never done a show on Windows itself.

657
00:38:41,273 --> 00:38:42,103
Scott: So let's begin.

658
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:44,850
Scott: Let's go through the history of Windows briefly.

659
00:38:45,392 --> 00:38:49,830
Rym: I never encountered or touched Windows until Windows three point one.

660
00:38:50,853 --> 00:38:52,410
Scott: Me, I encountered Windows three point.

661
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:53,739
Rym: Oh, I didn't.

662
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,170
Scott: Oh, not three point one.

663
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:56,810
Rym: We had three point one and then we bought.

664
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:57,813
Scott: I didn't have three point.

665
00:38:57,874 --> 00:39:00,444
Scott: oh at home, but I did use computers that had three point.

666
00:39:00,484 --> 00:39:01,910
Scott: oh at school and other people's houses.

667
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:02,332
Scott: I never.

668
00:39:02,899 --> 00:39:03,790
Scott: Oh, one and two.

669
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:06,430
Scott: I only saw because I intentionally went out to see them.

670
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:13,210
Rym: We did buy the upgrade of Windows three one one for work groups because we needed some of the network features that had.

671
00:39:14,412 --> 00:39:18,410
Scott: So what Windows originally was, was just not even an operating system.

672
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:20,190
Scott: DOS was the operating system.

673
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:22,290
Scott: And Windows was a shell, right?

674
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:24,510
Scott: Because DOS was not a graphical operating system.

675
00:39:24,652 --> 00:39:26,150
Scott: It was just a command line.

676
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:26,490
Scott: Yeah.

677
00:39:26,631 --> 00:39:33,870
Scott: So the original versions of Windows, what they would do is you would turn on your computer and you would see the DOS command prompt and you would run.

678
00:39:34,311 --> 00:39:41,350
Scott: You type win and press enter and it would run windows that exe a program and it would open up right windows.

679
00:39:42,031 --> 00:39:44,130
Scott: But DOS was still the operating system, right?

680
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:45,197
Scott: All the drivers were.

681
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:47,130
Scott: your mouse driver was still the DOS driver.

682
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:49,190
Scott: Your sound blaster was still the DOS driver.

683
00:39:49,711 --> 00:39:54,730
Scott: All these every all the interfacing with the hardware, the reading and writing files to the file system.

684
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:56,669
Scott: DOS was taking care of all that.

685
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:57,031
Scott: Right.

686
00:39:57,372 --> 00:40:05,230
Scott: Windows was just making a GUI and it was providing an interface for some other programs to run on Windows, like within the shell.

687
00:40:05,913 --> 00:40:06,094
Scott: Right.

688
00:40:06,114 --> 00:40:08,229
Scott: That had their own windows in windows.

689
00:40:08,891 --> 00:40:11,657
Scott: But it was anything that those programs did.

690
00:40:11,977 --> 00:40:18,150
Scott: was either going through like some Windows library, which was then going to DOS or was just going to DOS.

691
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:30,430
Rym: This is why, like even up through the Windows three one one era, if you were, say, playing a game, you never wanted to launch a game in Windows because Windows was using some of your extremely limited CPU cycles and memory.

692
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:31,950
Scott: So a lot of games you just couldn't.

693
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:33,750
Scott: You could only launch a Windows game in Windows.

694
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:42,330
Rym: So really, like you would start your computer and sometimes you type win because you wanted to use Windows and sometimes you just type the name of the VXE you wanted to run and it would just run.

695
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:47,990
Rym: Sometimes you'd even run a boot disk that just loaded the program you wanted to run directly.

696
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:52,268
Scott: So Windows didn't become an operating system until Windows NT.

697
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:53,311
Scott: Right.

698
00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:57,410
Scott: And Windows NT came out and it wasn't something that any people bought at their homes.

699
00:40:58,110 --> 00:40:58,554
Rym: I wanted to.

700
00:40:58,635 --> 00:41:00,269
Rym: My uncle had it because he worked at IBM.

701
00:41:00,731 --> 00:41:06,170
Scott: Well, it wasn't very useful for you at home because it's not like your favorite games would run on it yet.

702
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:06,571
Scott: Right.

703
00:41:06,651 --> 00:41:13,850
Scott: It was, you know, the earliest Windows NTs only ran like these business applications that were made for Windows NT.

704
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:14,692
Rym: Right.

705
00:41:14,712 --> 00:41:18,070
Rym: As a kid, I was obsessed with Windows NT partly because it supported Alpha chips.

706
00:41:18,452 --> 00:41:20,826
Rym: And I remember reading that an Alpha chip could run at 500 megahertz.

707
00:41:21,832 --> 00:41:24,009
Rym: And that was a ludicrous fucking number back then.

708
00:41:24,472 --> 00:41:27,150
Rym: And as a nerd kid, I was like, I want the fast computer.

709
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:31,490
Rym: And I went to a computer store with my parents and my parents were like, tell the person what you want.

710
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:36,129
Rym: And I was like, I want a computer with two Alpha processors so I can have multi processor support of Windows NT.

711
00:41:36,571 --> 00:41:38,729
Rym: I think I was like, nobody sells that.

712
00:41:39,811 --> 00:41:40,094
Scott: Yeah.

713
00:41:40,396 --> 00:41:41,910
Scott: It's you saw that in a computer magazine.

714
00:41:42,211 --> 00:41:43,548
Scott: No, we don't sell that at CompUSA.

715
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:46,490
Rym: It's like, yeah, if you have ten thousand dollars, go talk to this distributor.

716
00:41:47,291 --> 00:41:47,531
Scott: Right.

717
00:41:47,973 --> 00:41:52,630
Scott: But yeah, Windows NT was the first Windows that was like its own kernel, its own everything.

718
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:58,530
Scott: There were some ways compatibility layers to run some apps from, you know, other windows, but not really.

719
00:41:58,730 --> 00:41:59,071
Rym: Yeah, it was.

720
00:41:59,131 --> 00:42:00,655
Rym: It was also it was.

721
00:42:00,795 --> 00:42:03,441
Rym: it was the first time Windows was actually 32 bit like.

722
00:42:03,501 --> 00:42:05,606
Rym: even Windows 95 was like a 16 bit, 32 bit hybrid.

723
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:08,288
Rym: I used to be a lot of nonsense.

724
00:42:08,991 --> 00:42:09,151
Scott: Right.

725
00:42:09,171 --> 00:42:09,272
Scott: Sorry.

726
00:42:09,292 --> 00:42:14,584
Scott: So Windows NT started, but then Windows 95, what Windows 95 was was it was.

727
00:42:14,864 --> 00:42:17,370
Scott: basically it's like, oh, you think DOS is still there.

728
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:19,584
Scott: People thought it was just a shell like Windows 3.1 was.

729
00:42:20,831 --> 00:42:21,413
Scott: No, it wasn't.

730
00:42:21,594 --> 00:42:26,610
Scott: With the way Windows 95 worked is very interesting and that your computer would turn on with DOS.

731
00:42:27,054 --> 00:42:27,297
Scott: Right.

732
00:42:27,398 --> 00:42:28,108
Scott: If you wanted it to.

733
00:42:28,811 --> 00:42:37,610
Scott: But as soon as you launch Windows 95, Windows 95 would sort of push DOS out of the way and sort of take over its own deal.

734
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:42,909
Scott: And but DOS was still there, kind of as like this 16 bit sort of layer.

735
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:45,433
Scott: It's like if you were so like.

736
00:42:45,453 --> 00:42:55,846
Scott: if you wanted to run a Windows 3.1 app on Windows 95, well, it's going to be expecting to talk, you know, to use some DOS APIs to, you know, and it's going to be able to.

737
00:42:56,087 --> 00:42:58,550
Scott: DOS is still there right in the corner.

738
00:42:58,911 --> 00:43:04,670
Scott: So apps that what needs a DOS can still DOS, but the actual operating system is Windows 95.

739
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:10,270
Scott: If you open the Explorer in Windows 95 and make a file, Windows 95 is making the file.

740
00:43:10,591 --> 00:43:12,986
Scott: It's not like telling DOS to make a file the way Windows 3.1 did.

741
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:24,550
Rym: And I think it's worth stepping back a little bit about Windows 95, because that was one of the most important changes in consumer computing technology up to that point.

742
00:43:25,691 --> 00:43:31,610
Rym: Like Windows 95 introduced so many things that you take for granted today that did not exist before.

743
00:43:31,772 --> 00:43:33,410
Rym: Things like plug and play.

744
00:43:34,191 --> 00:43:35,018
Rym: You don't think about that.

745
00:43:35,038 --> 00:43:36,270
Rym: You plug in hardware to your computer.

746
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:36,993
Rym: It just works.

747
00:43:37,335 --> 00:43:40,110
Rym: That was not how hardware worked for all of computing.

748
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:42,849
Scott: Not having to do IRQs for your sound card.

749
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:44,835
Scott: Yeah.

750
00:43:45,036 --> 00:43:49,150
Rym: File names like having file names longer than eight characters plus an extension.

751
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:53,690
Rym: Not a thing in the Windows and DOS world until Windows 95.

752
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:54,769
Scott: Spaces in the file names.

753
00:43:55,331 --> 00:43:55,795
Rym: Yup.

754
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,430
Rym: Real multitasking.

755
00:43:57,870 --> 00:43:58,579
Rym: Mostly like.

756
00:43:58,599 --> 00:43:59,450
Rym: there's a big asterisk there.

757
00:43:59,711 --> 00:44:01,235
Scott: I don't know.

758
00:44:01,296 --> 00:44:06,050
Rym: Windows 3.1.1 had like you could call what it did multitasking.

759
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:10,470
Rym: Windows 95 had something that was effectively multitasking, but we're still not there yet.

760
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:13,370
Rym: But you can have multiple applications running at the same time.

761
00:44:13,672 --> 00:44:15,850
Rym: And for a normal person, that was fine.

762
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:20,152
Rym: That was not necessarily the case on Windows 3.1.1.

763
00:44:20,152 --> 00:44:23,110
Scott: When Windows 95 came out, it was like a hysteria.

764
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:24,749
Scott: Like, you know, people there were ads.

765
00:44:25,051 --> 00:44:33,049
Rym: I waited in line to buy Windows fucking 95 A and install it on a computer because it was up like there was a paradigm shift.

766
00:44:34,232 --> 00:44:34,433
Scott: Yep.

767
00:44:34,473 --> 00:44:39,360
Scott: So Windows 95 spawned this sort of heritage that went to 98, which is just really much better.

768
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:40,350
Scott: Windows 95.

769
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:42,818
Scott: Then there was 98 like B. That was like there was 95 B also.

770
00:44:43,951 --> 00:44:45,870
Scott: But there was like a 98 SE or whatever.

771
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:47,063
Scott: I think that was even better.

772
00:44:47,083 --> 00:44:48,110
Scott: Windows 98.

773
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:49,550
Rym: I had A and we never upgraded.

774
00:44:50,471 --> 00:44:55,950
Scott: I think I only had Windows 95 B and I only had Windows 98 SE like the better.

775
00:44:56,090 --> 00:44:57,210
Scott: Would you believe we had the better one?

776
00:44:57,390 --> 00:45:03,234
Rym: Would you believe I never, ever in my life owned a computer running any version of Windows 98?

777
00:45:03,234 --> 00:45:08,829
Scott: Well, I think the Windows 95, the original one didn't have support for USB.

778
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:09,631
Rym: Nope.

779
00:45:09,652 --> 00:45:12,047
Rym: You had to install this like extension pack.

780
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:17,790
Scott: The better one, Windows 95 B like had the USB support and that's the one I have.

781
00:45:18,412 --> 00:45:23,430
Scott: And then 98, I forget what the the better edition had, but whatever.

782
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:30,530
Scott: And then that chain of history went down to Windows ME, which is a complete disaster.

783
00:45:31,313 --> 00:45:31,619
Scott: Right.

784
00:45:31,639 --> 00:45:32,210
Scott: It completely failed.

785
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:40,729
Scott: I never had a computer that ran Windows ME either because in the freshman year of RIT, there were people who had Windows ME because that's when it came out.

786
00:45:41,131 --> 00:45:45,069
Scott: And I saw it on other people's computers very rarely, but I did see it.

787
00:45:45,572 --> 00:45:48,990
Rym: But it was not popular because there was sort of a split.

788
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:49,929
Rym: There was an interesting split.

789
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:57,563
Rym: Like it was actually kind of complicated back then because the what was Windows 95, that lineage moving into Windows, Windows ME ended up.

790
00:45:57,624 --> 00:46:02,190
Rym: Microsoft's almost tried to position it as that's the windows for regular people.

791
00:46:02,773 --> 00:46:04,101
Rym: And what was NT?

792
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:06,010
Rym: basically became Windows 2000.

793
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:12,410
Scott: And they marketed that as Windows 2000 is basically Windows NT five, right?

794
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:15,270
Scott: They just renamed it instead of calling it Windows NT five.

795
00:46:15,715 --> 00:46:17,291
Scott: They called it Windows 2000.

796
00:46:17,291 --> 00:46:22,579
Scott: And because of that marketing, not calling it NT anymore because NT was brand new technology.

797
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:23,489
Rym: I forget what it stood for.

798
00:46:23,711 --> 00:46:28,774
Scott: I forget what NT actually stands for, but brand wise, NT was viewed as only for businesses.

799
00:46:29,176 --> 00:46:31,270
Scott: You couldn't really use that for your home computer.

800
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:37,609
Rym: Good luck playing games with that was backronymed formally to new technology later.

801
00:46:38,711 --> 00:46:49,330
Scott: OK, but yes, but when they went to Windows 2000, the fact that it was called 2000 sort of suggested to people like, hey, you could actually run that yourself.

802
00:46:49,611 --> 00:46:54,912
Scott: It's not a business only, even though it was just Windows NT five and they had business users.

803
00:46:54,952 --> 00:47:03,909
Rym: But what happened was if you were a nerd and you had a computer, Windows NT had a lot of powerful capabilities that the windows did not by the time they got.

804
00:47:03,929 --> 00:47:05,949
Scott: because remember, the first Windows NT was three.

805
00:47:06,271 --> 00:47:06,512
Scott: Right.

806
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:10,468
Scott: So this is like, you know, two or three versions of Windows NT.

807
00:47:10,508 --> 00:47:12,472
Scott: later, it was called Windows 2000.

808
00:47:12,472 --> 00:47:17,330
Scott: And by that time it had the capabilities to run your software's your games.

809
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:18,710
Scott: You could play Counter Strike on that shit.

810
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:19,433
Scott: No problem.

811
00:47:19,453 --> 00:47:23,350
Rym: Windows NT had effectively real multitasking.

812
00:47:24,271 --> 00:47:24,432
Scott: Yep.

813
00:47:24,913 --> 00:47:31,879
Scott: And it was basically just vastly superior and vastly more stable and better than Windows 98 or ME.

814
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:38,276
Scott: And so anyone who knew anything about computers and was running Windows was using Windows 2000.

815
00:47:38,276 --> 00:47:39,930
Rym: And I remember this fascinating divide.

816
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:48,290
Rym: Everyone I knew who knew anything about computers at Windows 2000 and everyone else had Windows ME and had constant problems that weren't even their fault.

817
00:47:49,031 --> 00:47:49,881
Scott: Yeah, I don't remember that.

818
00:47:50,002 --> 00:47:50,610
Scott: I'm telling you not.

819
00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:51,887
Scott: I don't know that many people at ME.

820
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:56,050
Scott: It was people still stuck on 98 and people in 2000.

821
00:47:56,050 --> 00:48:00,390
Scott: But anyway, when that happened, ME and 2000 are sort of out at the same time.

822
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:05,190
Scott: Well, 2000 came first, actually, and then ME came out after and flopped.

823
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:06,834
Scott: And I guess they saw that.

824
00:48:07,135 --> 00:48:13,489
Scott: so enough consumers and not just businesses were using 2000 and they made the wise decision to just fucking go with it.

825
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:19,828
Scott: And then they went to Windows XP and Windows XP was like, OK, it's it's literally Windows NT six.

826
00:48:20,271 --> 00:48:20,613
Scott: Right.

827
00:48:21,095 --> 00:48:24,150
Scott: But we're going to make it like this is the only Windows.

828
00:48:24,590 --> 00:48:25,650
Scott: Everyone use this Windows.

829
00:48:25,971 --> 00:48:30,530
Scott: They intentionally marketed it to everybody, whether you're a business or not.

830
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:32,103
Scott: And that was the new better.

831
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:38,237
Rym: As it turns out, having a just a shittier operating system for the masses is not actually a good idea.

832
00:48:38,257 --> 00:48:39,409
Scott: You don't say.

833
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:39,811
Scott: Yep.

834
00:48:40,273 --> 00:48:44,230
Scott: So Windows XP, even though, you know, the look of it.

835
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:44,471
Scott: Right.

836
00:48:44,511 --> 00:48:47,570
Scott: People always think of like the way it looks and judge the whole thing by that.

837
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:50,170
Scott: But it's like, yeah, it looked a little bit Fisher pricey.

838
00:48:50,612 --> 00:48:50,915
Scott: Right.

839
00:48:51,016 --> 00:48:52,329
Scott: The way they the default looks.

840
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:53,115
Rym: But you know what?

841
00:48:53,136 --> 00:48:53,562
Rym: Who cares?

842
00:48:53,663 --> 00:48:54,069
Rym: It worked.

843
00:48:54,171 --> 00:48:55,570
Rym: Windows XP was rock solid.

844
00:48:56,210 --> 00:48:57,370
Scott: Windows XP was just great.

845
00:48:57,570 --> 00:48:58,037
Scott: There was nothing.

846
00:48:58,058 --> 00:48:58,810
Scott: It was just better.

847
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:01,390
Scott: Windows 2000 updated, you know, everyone.

848
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:06,310
Scott: When Windows XP came out, everyone eventually got on board the Windows XP train.

849
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:06,975
Scott: Right.

850
00:49:07,116 --> 00:49:08,469
Scott: And that was good to go.

851
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:09,392
Rym: Yeah.

852
00:49:09,412 --> 00:49:18,050
Rym: One last weird sort of aside that happened was after that, we had the infamous Windows Vista, which I had a weird moment and work a while ago and some training.

853
00:49:18,352 --> 00:49:20,810
Rym: And there's this instructor teaching us about some data science stuff.

854
00:49:21,393 --> 00:49:25,050
Rym: And he just they asked the class on the Zoom call kind of as part of the lesson.

855
00:49:25,552 --> 00:49:29,930
Rym: So I don't know how many of you are old enough to have ever heard of an operating system called Windows Vista.

856
00:49:30,832 --> 00:49:31,136
Scott: It's from 2006.

857
00:49:31,136 --> 00:49:31,439
Scott: It's not that.

858
00:49:31,439 --> 00:49:36,820
Rym: 2006 was a long time ago, 17 years ago.

859
00:49:39,611 --> 00:49:40,515
Scott: Yeah.

860
00:49:40,535 --> 00:49:43,350
Scott: So the deal with Windows Vista is that they had Windows XP.

861
00:49:43,610 --> 00:49:44,258
Scott: It was successful.

862
00:49:44,339 --> 00:49:45,109
Scott: It took over the world.

863
00:49:45,272 --> 00:49:46,409
Scott: And like, what do we do next?

864
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:48,770
Rym: Yeah, because the problem was Windows XP was fine.

865
00:49:48,991 --> 00:49:54,930
Rym: It did everything anyone needed, like not counting bit like super professionals doing like complex networking and enterprise environment.

866
00:49:55,530 --> 00:49:56,576
Rym: Windows XP was fine.

867
00:49:56,636 --> 00:50:02,030
Rym: Like as long as they kept getting security updates and people kept making drivers, your software just worked.

868
00:50:02,231 --> 00:50:05,810
Rym: And people's focus was really on the software, not the operating system.

869
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:10,249
Rym: Operating systems still were just the thing that ran your stuff.

870
00:50:11,151 --> 00:50:12,074
Scott: Yeah.

871
00:50:12,094 --> 00:50:17,773
Scott: So Windows Vista, Microsoft had all these grandiose plans and they tried to do too much with it.

872
00:50:17,833 --> 00:50:25,430
Scott: The big plan for Windows Vista was like this new like database based file system and all that really file system stuff was a big one.

873
00:50:25,610 --> 00:50:27,649
Scott: And they sort of failed to pull that off.

874
00:50:28,632 --> 00:50:31,750
Scott: They didn't succeed in the thing they were trying to do too much with.

875
00:50:32,171 --> 00:50:36,933
Scott: But because capitalism, they had to still release an update and get people to buy something.

876
00:50:36,953 --> 00:50:46,216
Rym: Remember this whole time, even leading into the modern era, you buy an operating system for a couple of hundred bucks and Microsoft never gets money from you again.

877
00:50:46,437 --> 00:50:48,509
Rym: So who pays for security updates?

878
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:54,050
Scott: Yeah, so but yeah, so people, you know, were just sticking with XP.

879
00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:54,995
Scott: They were happy with it.

880
00:50:55,015 --> 00:50:57,089
Scott: And Microsoft is like, shit, how do we make more money?

881
00:50:59,072 --> 00:51:02,546
Scott: So they ended up putting together Windows Vista and this is they.

882
00:51:02,727 --> 00:51:03,980
Scott: they started making a big mess.

883
00:51:04,082 --> 00:51:04,286
Scott: Right.

884
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:04,449
Scott: Yeah.

885
00:51:04,610 --> 00:51:06,310
Rym: The UI got like janky.

886
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:07,830
Rym: It was kind of unstable.

887
00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:15,408
Rym: I had a laptop that came with Vista and I I actually installed Windows 7 over it as soon as Windows 7 came out.

888
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:17,830
Scott: Yeah, they had all sorts of different versions of Vista.

889
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:21,050
Scott: Like it was an ultimate one that included everything in a home.

890
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:25,917
Scott: It was confusing to people which version they had to get different RAM limits for different versions.

891
00:51:25,978 --> 00:51:27,290
Rym: Now, there's another weird thing that happened.

892
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:39,532
Rym: The Windows Vista era was right around like the nadir of PC gaming, like PC gaming, Windows gaming, like people playing games on PCs had been just continuously a huge market.

893
00:51:39,793 --> 00:51:43,350
Scott: Well, this Windows Vista came out like basically when GeekNights started.

894
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:48,512
Scott: So like when PC gaming is also when iPhones were about like a year before iPhones appeared.

895
00:51:48,833 --> 00:51:55,409
Rym: So right around then was when a lot of nerds like us, like when Vista came out was when I said, you know what, fuck it.

896
00:51:55,935 --> 00:51:56,790
Rym: I'm not playing games.

897
00:51:57,090 --> 00:51:57,936
Rym: Windows sucks now.

898
00:51:58,017 --> 00:51:59,669
Rym: And that's when I ran Linux on the desktop.

899
00:52:01,215 --> 00:52:02,930
Rym: Like I skipped that generation for the most part.

900
00:52:04,611 --> 00:52:14,090
Scott: So, yeah, Windows Vista and it's like the thing is your apps, you know, people recognized in the software companies, recognize that not everyone was going to get Windows Vista.

901
00:52:14,971 --> 00:52:22,110
Scott: So they in that era, people kept making things and making sure they would work on Windows XP because that was still most of the user base.

902
00:52:22,411 --> 00:52:22,652
Scott: Right.

903
00:52:22,692 --> 00:52:29,390
Scott: So there was no really pressure to go to Vista and it got a bad reputation deserved entirely or not.

904
00:52:29,631 --> 00:52:29,892
Scott: Right.

905
00:52:29,952 --> 00:52:38,190
Scott: It was really mostly bad business problems by Microsoft and also failure to deliver on these their their plans that they had for it.

906
00:52:38,431 --> 00:52:43,189
Scott: If they had been able to deliver on those plans, Vista would have been some sort of revolutionary deal.

907
00:52:43,613 --> 00:52:45,069
Scott: They just weren't able to pull that off.

908
00:52:45,591 --> 00:52:49,549
Scott: And it was just sort of some incremental mess that didn't know what it wanted to be.

909
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:53,030
Scott: So anyway, then they're like, well, Vista was a debacle.

910
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:54,238
Scott: We're going to have to clean this up.

911
00:52:54,278 --> 00:52:55,989
Scott: So they put out Windows seven and clean that up.

912
00:52:56,290 --> 00:52:56,654
Scott: Right.

913
00:52:56,694 --> 00:52:56,997
Scott: Right.

914
00:52:58,690 --> 00:53:05,610
Scott: The same kind of deal that happened when they had a mess with Windows ME and they saw that 2000 was the way to go and they cleaned it up with Windows XP.

915
00:53:05,870 --> 00:53:07,850
Scott: They're like, well, let's do what we did in the past.

916
00:53:08,293 --> 00:53:10,169
Scott: Windows seven, we cleaned everything up.

917
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:11,448
Scott: Everybody, here you go.

918
00:53:11,810 --> 00:53:20,292
Rym: Windows seven, though, also they kind of backed away that there had been some UX trends around like how start menus worked and how you launch stuff and how you interacted with the operating system.

919
00:53:20,332 --> 00:53:23,201
Rym: But I'm not trying.

920
00:53:23,342 --> 00:53:27,870
Rym: a lot of people complain too much about the UIs and UXs of operating systems.

921
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:34,170
Scott: But I think that's the thing is for most people, that's the only like when they think about upgrading Windows, they don't understand.

922
00:53:34,370 --> 00:53:36,969
Scott: They're not thinking about like the ninety nine percent of what's going on.

923
00:53:37,070 --> 00:53:38,450
Rym: They're thinking like, wait, what's this file system?

924
00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:40,330
Rym: Like, what's the test scheduler?

925
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:41,850
Rym: Like, how's how's this thing working?

926
00:53:42,210 --> 00:53:47,830
Scott: The one percent of things that they that are different are the things that they can see and they focus entirely on that.

927
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:48,272
Scott: Right.

928
00:53:48,594 --> 00:53:49,479
Scott: And they're like, if there's like.

929
00:53:49,539 --> 00:53:52,273
Scott: if they don't like to look at the icons, like this is garbage.

930
00:53:52,333 --> 00:53:56,310
Scott: It's like you can make the best operating system with the most amazing kernel.

931
00:53:56,410 --> 00:54:00,530
Scott: that's 20 percent faster and more reliable and more secure.

932
00:54:01,032 --> 00:54:04,349
Scott: And if they don't if it's ugly, they'd be like, no, I'm staying with the old one.

933
00:54:04,871 --> 00:54:14,950
Rym: But I will say Windows Vista, like elements and menus started to get big and a little weird and they were ugly like Windows Vista is pretty fugly in my opinion.

934
00:54:15,530 --> 00:54:20,510
Rym: Windows seven like settled on this really clean aesthetic that I really like.

935
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:32,290
Scott: Well, you also have to consider, right, the time period in what became available in terms of GPU power monitors that the hardware technology that Microsoft had no control over.

936
00:54:32,290 --> 00:54:36,930
Scott: They just had to play to write, whereas Apple controls the hardware and buy the windows.

937
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:46,290
Rym: I remember Windows seven had options to turn on or turn off the nice UX that they had, whether or not you had a video card, because, you know, not everyone had video cards.

938
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:50,470
Rym: Windows seven came out right as PC gaming was starting to come again.

939
00:54:50,991 --> 00:54:56,009
Rym: Not that many people had dedicated GPUs on their Windows PCs up until Windows seven.

940
00:54:56,572 --> 00:54:59,072
Scott: You know, just like Windows 10 and Windows 11.

941
00:54:59,072 --> 00:54:59,355
Scott: Right.

942
00:54:59,395 --> 00:55:00,990
Scott: They got all these options for HDR.

943
00:55:01,374 --> 00:55:02,710
Scott: It's really the same kind of deal.

944
00:55:04,081 --> 00:55:04,243
Scott: Yeah.

945
00:55:04,263 --> 00:55:04,890
Scott: But so, yeah.

946
00:55:05,511 --> 00:55:20,110
Rym: And since then, Windows, honestly, like the only changes that are happening are changes you don't notice in the back end on like how it works or honestly, more and more features that I don't think many people use now.

947
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:21,898
Scott: So I get Windows eight was sort of like.

948
00:55:22,099 --> 00:55:27,230
Scott: why again, it was it wasn't nothing wrong with it, but it was like, why should I upgrade to Windows eight?

949
00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:28,609
Scott: Windows seven works just fine.

950
00:55:28,973 --> 00:55:29,235
Scott: Right.

951
00:55:29,739 --> 00:55:31,130
Scott: There's no reason for me to do so.

952
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:32,354
Scott: I never upgraded.

953
00:55:33,117 --> 00:55:40,634
Scott: Windows 10 came out and it's like, well, you know, now at this point, right, there have been so many advancements in hardware, I kind of need to upgrade Windows 10.

954
00:55:40,634 --> 00:55:43,110
Scott: Windows seven isn't supported really fully anymore.

955
00:55:43,330 --> 00:55:44,390
Scott: And it's not all the hardware.

956
00:55:44,872 --> 00:55:46,950
Scott: I see upgraded Windows 10 sort of add a necessity.

957
00:55:47,651 --> 00:55:54,079
Rym: And then Windows 11 really is not, you know, I would say there is no material difference between 10 and 11.

958
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:55,390
Rym: You just upgrade when you upgrade.

959
00:55:55,611 --> 00:55:56,714
Scott: Yeah, they're so.

960
00:55:56,995 --> 00:56:04,190
Scott: Windows 10 and 11 are so similar, architecturally speaking, it's like there is not a significant difference.

961
00:56:04,330 --> 00:56:07,329
Scott: Like anything that runs is going to run in either one of them just fine.

962
00:56:07,970 --> 00:56:10,090
Scott: You know, it's like why would you know?

963
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:11,410
Rym: Well, you know why I'm not upgrading?

964
00:56:11,751 --> 00:56:14,890
Rym: Because I'm still you know, I build my computers to fucking last.

965
00:56:15,071 --> 00:56:19,612
Rym: So this workstation was a supercomputer when I built it now in the year twenty twenty three.

966
00:56:20,094 --> 00:56:20,295
Rym: It's an.

967
00:56:20,476 --> 00:56:23,149
Rym: it's a sixth generation for gigahertz.

968
00:56:23,711 --> 00:56:24,233
Rym: I seven.

969
00:56:24,675 --> 00:56:28,370
Rym: Windows 11 will not run on sixth generation Intel chips.

970
00:56:28,811 --> 00:56:33,009
Scott: I see the CPU I have is like the oldest one that Windows 11 will run on.

971
00:56:33,270 --> 00:56:35,830
Scott: So I have I do like you have like an eighth generation.

972
00:56:35,970 --> 00:56:38,170
Scott: I want to say it's eighty seven hundred.

973
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:40,049
Rym: Yeah, I have a sixty seven hundred.

974
00:56:41,091 --> 00:56:43,150
Rym: No, it's not like five grand on this computer.

975
00:56:43,310 --> 00:56:46,190
Scott: What I think they're currently on like twelve, you know, the twelve.

976
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:46,973
Rym: Oh yeah.

977
00:56:47,053 --> 00:56:50,269
Rym: I think next year, twenty twenty four is the year it builds a new computer.

978
00:56:51,070 --> 00:57:02,230
Scott: Yeah, that Windows 11 is just, you know, I were Windows 10, you know, people are, you know, again, people heavily focus on the UI, but it's like it's just the same freaking thing as Windows 10.

979
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:03,315
Rym: Now, there's also the.

980
00:57:03,375 --> 00:57:07,112
Rym: there was the Windows Mobile, which, well, like that didn't go anywhere.

981
00:57:07,133 --> 00:57:10,370
Scott: So well, there was Windows, there's Windows CE and Windows Phone.

982
00:57:10,550 --> 00:57:11,314
Scott: They're two different things.

983
00:57:11,414 --> 00:57:11,575
Scott: Right.

984
00:57:11,595 --> 00:57:18,150
Scott: So Windows CE was actually started out as like a fork of Windows 95 to run on Palm Pilot like devices.

985
00:57:18,431 --> 00:57:18,653
Scott: Yeah.

986
00:57:18,793 --> 00:57:22,853
Scott: And they upgraded that for many, many years, I think all the way up to like twenty thirteen.

987
00:57:23,475 --> 00:57:27,310
Scott: But that wasn't just running Palm Pilot devices at those times.

988
00:57:27,730 --> 00:57:33,350
Scott: Windows CE was used for lots and lots of embedded like ATMs or the dream tasks.

989
00:57:34,310 --> 00:57:34,410
Scott: Right.

990
00:57:34,591 --> 00:57:42,850
Scott: All sorts of small devices where Windows was running and people who are going to make applications for those platforms were writing Windows applications.

991
00:57:43,392 --> 00:57:46,990
Scott: But the users of those devices never saw Microsoft Windows.

992
00:57:47,394 --> 00:57:48,527
Scott: Only the developers did.

993
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:50,305
Scott: And that was Windows CE.

994
00:57:50,870 --> 00:57:52,130
Scott: It started out as a Palm Pilot thing.

995
00:57:52,230 --> 00:57:53,269
Scott: It became an embedded thing.

996
00:57:53,550 --> 00:57:53,630
Rym: Yeah.

997
00:57:53,650 --> 00:57:58,393
Rym: Windows Phone was basically just and also ran like, you know, now we know how phones work.

998
00:57:58,413 --> 00:58:00,846
Scott: But Windows Fan was like Windows Phone was like.

999
00:58:00,866 --> 00:58:02,374
Scott: they made that almost like it's.

1000
00:58:02,474 --> 00:58:05,370
Scott: it's not like part of the other Windows architectures.

1001
00:58:05,810 --> 00:58:05,910
Scott: Right.

1002
00:58:05,931 --> 00:58:11,230
Scott: It's like it's its own platform they tried to make to compete with iOS and Android and they failed.

1003
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:15,170
Rym: Well, iOS, Android, like WebOS, free the Palm Pre like that OS.

1004
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:21,566
Rym: There was a bunch of OS's because the smartphone world was new and early and there's a big OS.

1005
00:58:22,110 --> 00:58:22,635
Scott: They were smart.

1006
00:58:22,675 --> 00:58:24,330
Scott: Microsoft knew they had to get in on that.

1007
00:58:24,470 --> 00:58:25,729
Scott: They just failed to get in on that.

1008
00:58:26,050 --> 00:58:27,167
Rym: Yeah, they all know.

1009
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:30,750
Rym: So apparently they the last release was less long ago than I thought.

1010
00:58:30,770 --> 00:58:31,497
Rym: It was twenty twenty.

1011
00:58:31,517 --> 00:58:32,668
Rym: Yeah.

1012
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:34,193
Rym: God damn.

1013
00:58:34,818 --> 00:58:36,430
Scott: I'm sure someone out there has a Windows Phone.

1014
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:39,670
Rym: I've got my Palm Pre laying around somewhere.

1015
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:40,594
Scott: Yeah.

1016
00:58:40,998 --> 00:58:42,150
Scott: There's also Windows Server.

1017
00:58:42,270 --> 00:58:47,952
Scott: But Windows Server is basically just regular Windows with some software that's like included.

1018
00:58:47,972 --> 00:58:52,169
Rym: You know, I've heavily used Windows software, Windows Server Active Directory and shit like that.

1019
00:58:52,370 --> 00:59:08,910
Rym: You know, well, the other thing which is not really true anymore in the old days, like when I worked at IBM, if you had a like workstation with a capital W, like the kind of thing where you're putting a weird raid in a server like this is already everything I'm describing does not exist anymore.

1020
00:59:09,031 --> 00:59:10,869
Rym: We do things very differently in server rooms today.

1021
00:59:11,311 --> 00:59:20,390
Rym: But like if you were putting eight CPUs in a weird workstation for a weird use case in the year 2005, Windows Server was necessary.

1022
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:23,390
Rym: Like regular windows could not address that hardware.

1023
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:24,732
Scott: There weren't.

1024
00:59:24,772 --> 00:59:25,173
Scott: Yeah.

1025
00:59:25,274 --> 00:59:33,310
Scott: Regular windows had, you know, limits both artificial and real in terms of how much hardware it could use.

1026
00:59:33,912 --> 00:59:34,112
Scott: Right.

1027
00:59:34,193 --> 00:59:39,987
Scott: It's like you could have a computer with like 32 gigs of RAM in it, you know, if you could afford one and get one.

1028
00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:44,449
Scott: And, you know, you would only be at, let's see, Windows XP RAM limit.

1029
00:59:46,031 --> 00:59:46,211
Scott: Yeah.

1030
00:59:46,352 --> 00:59:53,090
Scott: If you had Windows XP and you had a x86 CPU, you could only use four gigs of RAM.

1031
00:59:53,391 --> 00:59:53,612
Rym: All right.

1032
00:59:53,632 --> 01:00:05,634
Rym: So meanwhile, Windows 2003 server, the one I use the most, I actually administered the DNS server for IBM's fab on a bunch of Windows servers that I built myself physically.

1033
01:00:06,396 --> 01:00:11,552
Rym: And that thing could have up to sixty four gigabytes of RAM by default.

1034
01:00:12,335 --> 01:00:17,231
Rym: But you could get it up to five hundred and twelve gigabytes if you did fancy stuff.

1035
01:00:18,196 --> 01:00:22,158
Scott: And some of this is because you had, you know, 32 bit operating systems and they weren't 64 bit yet.

1036
01:00:24,237 --> 01:00:24,482
Scott: Right.

1037
01:00:24,666 --> 01:00:24,850
Scott: Yeah.

1038
01:00:24,990 --> 01:00:30,472
Scott: But some of it was also because, you know, they baked in there like, hey, we're not going to.

1039
01:00:30,512 --> 01:00:33,670
Scott: we want you to buy the pro edition and then we'll let you use more RAM.

1040
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:34,396
Scott: I actually had.

1041
01:00:34,678 --> 01:00:36,230
Scott: there have been I think Windows seven.

1042
01:00:36,390 --> 01:00:41,149
Scott: I had Windows seven home and I had to pay to upgrade to Windows seven pro because I didn't know about the RAM limit.

1043
01:00:41,330 --> 01:00:44,564
Scott: And I was like, I had thirty two gigs of RAM and I could.

1044
01:00:44,846 --> 01:00:46,603
Scott: I turned my computer and it's like you got 16 or something.

1045
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:48,296
Scott: I'm like, what the fuck is this?

1046
01:00:48,738 --> 01:00:53,149
Scott: And I had to switch to Windows seven pro and then I could use all thirty two gigs of my RAM.

1047
01:00:53,411 --> 01:00:57,310
Scott: Right now, in terms of purely an artificial limit by Microsoft to make money.

1048
01:00:57,430 --> 01:01:04,309
Rym: So in terms of like the OS itself, like these days, really, there are two of you're a horrible person using a computer for almost anything.

1049
01:01:05,271 --> 01:01:05,674
Rym: There are.

1050
01:01:05,714 --> 01:01:08,290
Rym: you either run iOS or you're on Windows.

1051
01:01:08,953 --> 01:01:10,649
Rym: And honestly, you know what it comes down to?

1052
01:01:11,035 --> 01:01:11,770
Rym: Not even preference.

1053
01:01:12,213 --> 01:01:14,350
Rym: It comes down to are you a gamer?

1054
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:16,168
Rym: You got to run Windows like that's it.

1055
01:01:16,693 --> 01:01:17,688
Rym: Full stop for now.

1056
01:01:18,491 --> 01:01:22,630
Scott: Well, you can also you know, I think that's that's what games you're playing, right?

1057
01:01:22,710 --> 01:01:23,112
Scott: It's only.

1058
01:01:23,132 --> 01:01:31,457
Scott: you only really need Windows if you want to play the games that run on Windows, which, you know, which is a lot a lot of small indie games only run on Windows.

1059
01:01:31,478 --> 01:01:32,130
Rym: Right.

1060
01:01:32,270 --> 01:01:35,827
Scott: Well, I'm saying is like the thing about Windows is that it you could.

1061
01:01:35,847 --> 01:01:42,827
Scott: with a Windows computer, you can run basically everything ever, either by emulation or for real.

1062
01:01:44,251 --> 01:01:55,003
Scott: It's like whereas if you get some other devices, right, you're going to have to either hope there's a port or you can use some cloud streaming or you could use maybe emulating.

1063
01:01:55,166 --> 01:01:55,370
Scott: Right.

1064
01:01:55,610 --> 01:01:57,681
Scott: It's like your library of game.

1065
01:01:57,761 --> 01:01:59,510
Scott: choices, though, will still be enormous.

1066
01:01:59,631 --> 01:02:02,230
Scott: Like you could be a gamer that only plays iOS games.

1067
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:05,388
Scott: And it's like that's still an enormous shit ton of games.

1068
01:02:05,830 --> 01:02:06,413
Rym: What you'll find?

1069
01:02:06,433 --> 01:02:09,651
Rym: because you're taught that enormous library spans decades in terms of like.

1070
01:02:10,134 --> 01:02:13,574
Rym: go look at Steam and look at a game someone wants to play today that your friends are playing.

1071
01:02:13,958 --> 01:02:15,209
Rym: Odds are it doesn't run on a Mac.

1072
01:02:16,735 --> 01:02:17,849
Scott: Oh, you go on.

1073
01:02:18,070 --> 01:02:18,595
Scott: There's a lot.

1074
01:02:18,655 --> 01:02:19,099
Scott: But yeah, it's.

1075
01:02:19,220 --> 01:02:19,603
Scott: it's not.

1076
01:02:19,825 --> 01:02:20,350
Scott: there's enough.

1077
01:02:20,770 --> 01:02:24,952
Rym: Partly because in our Discord, one of our friends is on iOS and doesn't have any Windows PCs.

1078
01:02:25,374 --> 01:02:28,890
Rym: And a bunch of times this year has said, hey, I want to play X game.

1079
01:02:28,971 --> 01:02:30,269
Rym: And it turns out it doesn't run on their Mac.

1080
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:31,491
Scott: Right.

1081
01:02:31,531 --> 01:02:32,154
Scott: Well, that's the thing.

1082
01:02:32,194 --> 01:02:43,470
Scott: It's like, number one, if you look at a Mac or Linux and you look at the list of games that can run on there, it's like it's surprisingly larger than you think, especially with some of the emulation layers.

1083
01:02:43,630 --> 01:02:45,310
Scott: It's like, oh, you can play all those games on there.

1084
01:02:45,410 --> 01:02:45,573
Scott: Wow.

1085
01:02:45,594 --> 01:02:46,410
Scott: I had no idea.

1086
01:02:46,771 --> 01:02:54,770
Scott: But if you take your Steam library and you have a large one like I do and you and you filter it and you say, all right, Mac only, it'll still get cut in half.

1087
01:02:55,292 --> 01:02:55,432
Scott: Yeah.

1088
01:02:55,513 --> 01:02:55,694
Scott: Right.

1089
01:02:56,116 --> 01:02:58,730
Scott: It's like, you know, so it's like, oh, you know.

1090
01:02:58,831 --> 01:03:00,450
Scott: All these games still are on the list.

1091
01:03:00,731 --> 01:03:02,248
Scott: But oh, there's the half that aren't.

1092
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:02,711
Rym: Yeah.

1093
01:03:02,994 --> 01:03:05,090
Rym: You know, but Windows just works.

1094
01:03:05,271 --> 01:03:05,753
Rym: It's easy.

1095
01:03:05,833 --> 01:03:10,476
Rym: Like there's a reason why it's the most like it's the OS people use on computers.

1096
01:03:10,818 --> 01:03:12,930
Rym: I think the only reason that might change is over time.

1097
01:03:13,011 --> 01:03:14,390
Rym: I think people just don't have computers.

1098
01:03:15,451 --> 01:03:15,671
Scott: Yeah.

1099
01:03:15,832 --> 01:03:25,467
Scott: I mean, I think that it's really the only reason Windows has been so successful, right, is that, you know, it was that first GUI in there and it was up.

1100
01:03:25,568 --> 01:03:27,328
Scott: the only other GUI it was really up against.

1101
01:03:27,892 --> 01:03:30,224
Scott: There were some other ones, but they didn't have a chance.

1102
01:03:30,285 --> 01:03:31,310
Scott: business wise was the Mac.

1103
01:03:32,192 --> 01:03:32,332
Scott: Right.

1104
01:03:32,533 --> 01:03:40,030
Scott: And so people, you know, business wise, we're already using, you know, Windows and the software was coming out for DOS.

1105
01:03:40,471 --> 01:03:40,752
Scott: Right.

1106
01:03:41,334 --> 01:03:51,004
Scott: And, you know, the games are coming out for DOS and, you know, that beat the Mac, at least until, you know, the return of jobs in the G3, G4 days later.

1107
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:53,112
Scott: Right.

1108
01:03:53,614 --> 01:03:57,250
Scott: So and then people made software for Windows.

1109
01:03:57,391 --> 01:03:57,955
Scott: And it's like this.

1110
01:03:58,841 --> 01:04:00,110
Scott: People weren't coming for Windows.

1111
01:04:00,330 --> 01:04:02,630
Scott: People came for the software.

1112
01:04:03,612 --> 01:04:08,271
Rym: And pretty much the reason all OS's ever rose and fell was people went to them for the software.

1113
01:04:08,311 --> 01:04:08,713
Rym: they ran.

1114
01:04:08,733 --> 01:04:20,055
Scott: And nowadays, not only did the phone, you know, provide a new platform to where there could be a new war over what people, but nowadays people come for just the web.

1115
01:04:20,297 --> 01:04:22,330
Scott: So it's like it doesn't even matter that much.

1116
01:04:22,510 --> 01:04:26,370
Scott: It's like, you know, we joked about Windows phone, like, haha, who's using Windows phone?

1117
01:04:26,510 --> 01:04:26,691
Scott: Right.

1118
01:04:26,731 --> 01:04:32,890
Scott: But, you know, honestly, if you got a Windows phone, it definitely has probably some Microsoft Edge web browser on it.

1119
01:04:32,990 --> 01:04:37,588
Scott: Like you could probably just use a Windows phone and be mostly just fine.

1120
01:04:37,668 --> 01:04:43,390
Scott: if you're not expecting to get like, you know, a native like app for TikTok or something.

1121
01:04:43,712 --> 01:04:45,290
Scott: But you can go to TikTok.com on it.

1122
01:04:45,470 --> 01:04:46,510
Scott: Probably just just fine.

1123
01:04:46,630 --> 01:04:46,851
Scott: Right.

1124
01:04:46,891 --> 01:05:04,461
Scott: So that's what's, you know, taken away from Windows's power is that the web is the platform now, but there is so much Windows software that already exists and games and some business apps continue to be these sort of.

1125
01:05:04,923 --> 01:05:07,949
Scott: you need Windows to run these things that you actually care about.

1126
01:05:08,290 --> 01:05:12,370
Scott: Therefore, Windows can still get a stranglehold on the world.

1127
01:05:13,791 --> 01:05:21,510
Rym: Yeah, I mean, I did Linux on the desktop for a while, but as soon as I wanted to do any PC gaming, I started dual booting Windows again.

1128
01:05:21,610 --> 01:05:25,270
Rym: And now I'm back on Windows, probably effectively permanently.

1129
01:05:26,410 --> 01:05:42,990
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I guess there's also the one other thing being that, you know, there's certain hardware you might want to use for some reason and a lot of hardware, I guess, you know, USB-C is, you know, putting another nail in this to drive even more away from Windows, get, you know, controlling everything.

1130
01:05:43,171 --> 01:05:52,413
Scott: But there's plenty of hardware in the world that will only work with a Windows computer or maybe a Linux computer if someone wrote an open source driver and reverse engineered it or something.

1131
01:05:52,433 --> 01:05:55,429
Scott: So and even then, it won't work 100 percent perfectly.

1132
01:05:55,974 --> 01:05:56,890
Scott: Maybe, maybe it will.

1133
01:05:57,030 --> 01:05:57,574
Scott: Maybe it won't.

1134
01:05:57,674 --> 01:05:57,856
Scott: Right.

1135
01:05:57,916 --> 01:05:59,809
Scott: But if you got a Windows computer, it's going to work.

1136
01:06:00,431 --> 01:06:11,970
Scott: So if you are using any kind of hardware, right, that, you know, doesn't have like an official Mac support or something or official Linux support, it's going to have official Windows support 100 percent of the time.

1137
01:06:12,690 --> 01:06:24,090
Rym: What I find funny is when I think about how I've engaged with Windows pretty much from the Windows 7 era onward, I don't really use anything in the OS like my interactions with every Windows since 7 is always the same.

1138
01:06:24,430 --> 01:06:25,269
Rym: I hit the Windows key.

1139
01:06:25,670 --> 01:06:27,169
Rym: I took the name of the program I'm going to run.

1140
01:06:27,732 --> 01:06:30,170
Rym: And that's the extent of my interaction with Windows directly.

1141
01:06:31,291 --> 01:06:36,990
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know, I might have to use Windows Explorer to run some, you know, browse some files or something.

1142
01:06:37,450 --> 01:06:38,530
Rym: But even then, I hit the Windows key.

1143
01:06:38,610 --> 01:06:41,949
Rym: I took the name of the folder I'm looking for and then I navigate from there in the Windows Explorer.

1144
01:06:42,971 --> 01:06:53,430
Scott: Yeah, but it's like in the in the earlier Windows days from, you know, three point one through two thousand through even up to, you know, seven close to seven, you had to do.

1145
01:06:53,630 --> 01:06:57,790
Scott: you know, you had Windows and like you would do a lot of Windows kind of stuff, right?

1146
01:06:58,230 --> 01:07:02,790
Scott: You know, configuring settings, even it was just Microsoft Solitaire.

1147
01:07:03,231 --> 01:07:08,094
Rym: It's like running applications that came with the operating system and ran within the operating system.

1148
01:07:08,517 --> 01:07:15,333
Rym: It's nuts to think that as a kid, I would spend a lot of time sitting in front of a computer that was not networked to anything and I was amusing myself just fine.

1149
01:07:17,083 --> 01:07:18,290
Rym: Nowadays, the Internet goes down.

1150
01:07:18,410 --> 01:07:20,730
Rym: I don't really launch, like I don't go to my computer.

1151
01:07:22,510 --> 01:07:30,950
Scott: No, not really, yeah, but yeah, Windows, we'll see how long Windows, you know, because it's Windows isn't growing, right?

1152
01:07:31,151 --> 01:07:35,150
Scott: It's just going to remain dominant in the desktop space, which is a shrinking space.

1153
01:07:35,292 --> 01:07:36,930
Scott: But it's the king of that space, right?

1154
01:07:37,030 --> 01:07:38,870
Scott: That's the fish that takes up this whole pond.

1155
01:07:39,010 --> 01:07:40,109
Scott: The pond is drying up.

1156
01:07:40,694 --> 01:07:40,936
Scott: Right.

1157
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:42,870
Scott: How long will Windows rule?

1158
01:07:43,391 --> 01:07:55,809
Scott: And if Windows doesn't rule, that's like that will be like a catastrophe because all this history of software that will only run on Windows, we will need some way to run that software.

1159
01:07:56,310 --> 01:08:08,410
Rym: So according to I tried to look up stats, they all are about the same, supposedly generalizing in terms of devices that have operating systems running on them that we could extrapolate or get data about like the websites or things.

1160
01:08:09,190 --> 01:08:22,710
Rym: The top operating system in the world is Android with 44 percent of the market Windows of all computing devices, including servers and it looks like consumer devices.

1161
01:08:22,991 --> 01:08:40,529
Rym: I'm going through a bunch of different stats sites and I'm not I haven't read all the caveats on this page, but 40 percent, 40 to 45 percent Android, 30 percent Windows, 17 percent iOS, five percent OS X, one percent unknown point, one percent Linux.

1162
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:46,559
Scott: Yeah, Android is crushing it because they've got, you know, like a lot of the phones, obviously.

1163
01:08:46,578 --> 01:08:46,926
Scott: Right.

1164
01:08:47,350 --> 01:08:51,023
Scott: Especially, you know, Apple is like, you know, the the.

1165
01:08:51,082 --> 01:08:56,710
Scott: even in countries where iOS is the king, like the US, it's like Android still has a sizable chunk.

1166
01:08:57,313 --> 01:09:00,069
Scott: And in some places, Android is just the only game in town.

1167
01:09:00,270 --> 01:09:01,703
Scott: iOS hasn't really gotten in here.

1168
01:09:02,470 --> 01:09:03,252
Rym: I can pull it also.

1169
01:09:03,394 --> 01:09:03,795
Rym: I can pull it.

1170
01:09:03,935 --> 01:09:09,484
Rym: I can pull it to just does just desktops, windows, 75 percent, OS X, 15 percent.

1171
01:09:10,370 --> 01:09:11,147
Rym: Nothing else registers.

1172
01:09:11,830 --> 01:09:12,345
Rym: Linux, three percent.

1173
01:09:13,611 --> 01:09:13,812
Scott: Right.

1174
01:09:14,093 --> 01:09:19,609
Scott: But Android is so dominant because there are so many embedded devices.

1175
01:09:19,832 --> 01:09:20,014
Scott: Right.

1176
01:09:20,054 --> 01:09:21,490
Scott: The Windows CE category.

1177
01:09:21,852 --> 01:09:22,053
Scott: Right.

1178
01:09:22,153 --> 01:09:25,090
Scott: Where Android is things run Android that you don't realize.

1179
01:09:25,611 --> 01:09:25,812
Scott: Right.

1180
01:09:25,971 --> 01:09:32,492
Scott: It's like cars running Android, smart TVs running Android, refrigerator running Android.

1181
01:09:32,532 --> 01:09:32,693
Scott: Right.

1182
01:09:32,752 --> 01:09:41,729
Scott: In the year twenty twenty two, twenty three, if it's some kind of embedded device like Android is like you can't install iOS on it, they don't sell that.

1183
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:41,971
Scott: Right.

1184
01:09:41,993 --> 01:09:42,720
Scott: What are you going to do?

1185
01:09:42,761 --> 01:09:43,247
Scott: Windows CE?

1186
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:44,051
Scott: No.

1187
01:09:44,493 --> 01:09:44,634
Scott: Right.

1188
01:09:44,654 --> 01:09:47,790
Scott: Your choices are Linux and Android and Android is kind of Linux.

1189
01:09:48,291 --> 01:09:48,612
Scott: Right.

1190
01:09:49,698 --> 01:09:51,810
Scott: So and it's like you got Android developers.

1191
01:09:51,870 --> 01:09:52,031
Scott: Right.

1192
01:09:52,173 --> 01:09:54,109
Scott: It's more than you have Linux developers.

1193
01:09:54,270 --> 01:09:54,431
Scott: Yeah.

1194
01:09:55,157 --> 01:09:56,850
Scott: So an Android can run on a phone.

1195
01:09:57,011 --> 01:09:58,649
Scott: It can run on any other small things.

1196
01:09:58,790 --> 01:10:04,030
Scott: So Android is like the go to for any small device and it's running, you know, it's running.

1197
01:10:04,170 --> 01:10:04,954
Scott: That's what's running there.

1198
01:10:04,974 --> 01:10:08,889
Rym: You don't realize in terms of websites being hit where they can figure out the OS.

1199
01:10:09,091 --> 01:10:09,555
Rym: It's the same.

1200
01:10:09,575 --> 01:10:11,330
Rym: It's almost the same numbers.

1201
01:10:11,431 --> 01:10:12,260
Rym: It's the same ratios.

1202
01:10:12,361 --> 01:10:13,170
Rym: Androids far away.

1203
01:10:13,230 --> 01:10:17,730
Rym: The best Windows is right behind iOS is almost nothing and nothing else registers.

1204
01:10:18,932 --> 01:10:20,669
Scott: Yep, pretty much.

1205
01:10:21,012 --> 01:10:23,129
Rym: Yeah, because it doesn't matter that much.

1206
01:10:23,672 --> 01:10:34,669
Rym: In fact, the biggest danger to Windows, if they start trying to monetize it and move to an app ecosystem, the fact that Microsoft Windows just lets you fucking run any EXE you want is a big part of why it still exists today.

1207
01:10:38,893 --> 01:10:41,030
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1208
01:10:41,230 --> 01:10:46,169
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1209
01:10:46,570 --> 01:10:51,590
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

1210
01:10:51,930 --> 01:10:54,510
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1211
01:10:54,790 --> 01:10:59,273
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1212
01:10:59,615 --> 01:11:02,767
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1213
01:11:04,110 --> 01:11:07,029
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1214
01:11:07,311 --> 01:11:10,210
