00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:08,760

Rym: It's Thursday, June 15th, 2023.

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:12,521
Rym: I'm Rym.

00:00:13,203 --> 00:00:15,329
Rym: I'm Scott and this is geek guides.

Rym: tonight We are talking about airplane food and Airport food.

6
00:00:21,682 --> 00:00:25,638
Rym: Let's do this Talking about some worst-case food scenario.

7
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:26,421
Scott: Did you say the right?

8
00:00:26,461 --> 00:00:27,364
Scott: Did you say the right day?

9
00:00:27,565 --> 00:00:28,910
Rym: I absolutely said the right day.

10
00:00:29,011 --> 00:00:29,192
Rym: I am.

11
00:00:29,313 --> 00:00:30,522
Rym: I was studious about that.

12
00:00:30,542 --> 00:00:32,774
Rym: I haven't had a Physical note.

13
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:37,530
Rym: I wrote with a pen on a piece of paper to hide me to say the right date.

14
00:00:38,512 --> 00:00:39,096
Scott: I had a remember.

15
00:00:39,136 --> 00:00:39,720
Scott: I remembered.

16
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,860
Scott: I'm like make sure Rym says the right day But I didn't remember to say anything before you said the day.

17
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,350
Scott: it was just after you finished and with show started.

18
00:00:46,431 --> 00:00:49,229
Scott: I was like, oh wait, I remember I was supposed to.

19
00:00:50,072 --> 00:00:55,590
Rym: There were ancient times where we record shows ahead more frequently, but that was back when one we did shows four nights a week.

20
00:00:56,032 --> 00:00:58,683
Rym: You know ancient times and two we like.

21
00:00:58,723 --> 00:01:00,270
Rym: we were trying to emulate penny arcade.

22
00:01:00,431 --> 00:01:03,143
Rym: So we like really didn't ever want to miss a show.

23
00:01:03,183 --> 00:01:07,061
Scott: so we would like record Do either not like right now.

24
00:01:07,181 --> 00:01:08,710
Scott: I got too many things to do this week.

25
00:01:09,192 --> 00:01:12,845
Scott: Nothing is really big have no travel or anything to interfere with the show.

26
00:01:12,905 --> 00:01:14,110
Scott: No sickness, right?

27
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:20,970
Scott: It just happens coincidentally that two events that I feel were valuable enough to more value.

28
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,894
Scott: you know one-time events that are valuable enough to Cancel or delay.

29
00:01:25,934 --> 00:01:30,690
Scott: geek that's happened here Tuesday exactly Tuesday and exactly Thursday.

30
00:01:31,893 --> 00:01:34,349
Scott: We cancel Tuesday and we're gonna record Thursday on Monday.

31
00:01:37,272 --> 00:01:47,355
Rym: But we haven't done this in a while because for the last I'd say seven years if we really couldn't do a show we just Bail on it, but didn't want to bail on two in a row, especially because as Covid is that we're bailing

32
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:48,501
Scott: quite a bit lately, right?

33
00:01:48,521 --> 00:01:50,008
Scott: Let's on you know on bail here.

34
00:01:50,189 --> 00:02:04,630
Rym: Yep It's partly because you know, like you said more Joe if I zoom out a little bit It's almost like all the things I wasn't doing for the last three years because I guess something was happening Are like all coming back into my life, but they're almost like more things are happening.

35
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:11,148
Rym: I have more things scheduled now in the year 2023 than I did in the first part of the year 2019 on a daily.

36
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:17,010
Scott: I mean, it's not it's not conscious, but I I am just lately doing doing things.

37
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:20,944
Rym: Yeah, and also our video game cup overflow with like two crazy degree.

38
00:02:21,004 --> 00:02:24,135
Scott: I only got two video games right now I was the kingdom.

39
00:02:24,195 --> 00:02:27,246
Scott: I've pushed away all other video games except those two.

40
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:31,837
Rym: I got two I got four I got those two plus Overwatch and fortnight.

41
00:02:31,857 --> 00:02:33,345
Scott: I don't get that.

42
00:02:33,505 --> 00:02:33,968
Scott: forget that.

43
00:02:34,088 --> 00:02:34,309
Scott: All right

44
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:50,330
Rym: Yep, so, uh in one news and we're not gonna talk about it because you should just read the real news about it But it's big enough for us got to mention it the former guy, you know our piece of shit fascist former president Was arrested for the second time this time on federal charges like for real, right?

45
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:53,622
Scott: So the first one so the first one was not federal charges.

46
00:02:53,883 --> 00:02:55,690
Rym: It was state charges and it's ongoing.

47
00:02:55,811 --> 00:03:04,610
Rym: So he has an ongoing court case Because he is accused of a huge number of felony like fraud counts by New York State, right?

48
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:21,970
Scott: so this would be like if I robbed a convenience store, right and then I Did some smuggling of Fireworks like Tennessee to some right and so that one of them is crossing state borders and that's a federal crime.

49
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:23,273
Scott: Maybe like.

50
00:03:23,534 --> 00:03:24,036
Scott: maybe I did.

51
00:03:24,076 --> 00:03:27,410
Scott: just like some I flew a plane in with smuggled some drugs into the country.

52
00:03:27,571 --> 00:03:31,589
Scott: It's a federal crime RICO act right and then I also robbed a convenience store.

53
00:03:31,971 --> 00:03:41,238
Scott: so when I robbed the convenience store the court in New York is gonna be like, hey, that's like Larceny or theft or something, you know, some burglary Aggravated something right?

54
00:03:41,258 --> 00:03:44,819
Scott: They'll probably get a whole list of charges Beating up the convenience store guy.

55
00:03:44,839 --> 00:03:47,170
Rym: you're hereby accused of aggravated something.

56
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,316
Scott: And then so so they got.

57
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:54,390
Scott: so they're they're arresting me in New York, but meanwhile, there's some some other law enforcement somewhere else.

58
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:59,630
Scott: He's like, hey, we saw this Scott robbed the convenience store, but he also smuggled drugs into the country.

59
00:03:59,811 --> 00:04:02,469
Scott: So we need to bring into this other court also.

60
00:04:02,758 --> 00:04:02,969
Scott: Yeah.

61
00:04:03,431 --> 00:04:09,830
Scott: And then it's like if I let's say I get found guilty in both courts and they they want like one year of jail each.

62
00:04:10,414 --> 00:04:15,970
Scott: It's like I don't know which one I go to first But it's like you don't get to you don't get to double up, right?

63
00:04:16,031 --> 00:04:21,889
Scott: I would have to be in like a federal prison for a year And then when I get as soon as I get out New York would be there to collect me.

64
00:04:22,632 --> 00:04:28,110
Scott: Take me to the New York prison for the second year and those crimes I mentioned obviously wouldn't be one year each.

65
00:04:28,532 --> 00:04:30,581
Scott: But that's the kind of scenario we could see here.

66
00:04:31,084 --> 00:04:37,024
Scott: if he's guilty on Charges in and counts in both cases and who knows if even more cases.

67
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:37,686
Rym: Well, there are.

68
00:04:37,807 --> 00:04:40,137
Rym: so they're in Atlanta, right?

69
00:04:40,318 --> 00:04:46,650
Rym: There's a Georgia case which is around Literally trying to steal the election like real just in Georgia.

70
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,134
Rym: Separately, there's the Jack.

71
00:04:49,174 --> 00:04:54,750
Rym: There's the special counsel case of did he commit treason on January 6th and tried to steal the election?

72
00:04:55,732 --> 00:05:01,787
Scott: But the point is if he gets multiple guilties from all around right all these sentences could pile up.

73
00:05:01,867 --> 00:05:06,810
Scott: and if he survives one Sentence then, you know, I don't know how they're gonna decide who goes first, right?

74
00:05:08,114 --> 00:05:08,675
Scott: Or whatever.

75
00:05:08,736 --> 00:05:10,501
Scott: but they there could be.

76
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:21,670
Scott: as a day we're like, oh Trump gets out of prison and Well, so just the new case that he was arrested for on Tuesday that day could come so he would hopefully live to see that day.

77
00:05:22,133 --> 00:05:26,436
Rym: I watched legal Eagles like Explanation of the indictment and he was like.

78
00:05:26,476 --> 00:05:30,477
Rym: this is like the most Agro indictment I have ever seen.

79
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:31,521
Rym: like it is.

80
00:05:31,922 --> 00:05:34,069
Rym: it is making it clear that this is like.

81
00:05:34,872 --> 00:05:40,370
Rym: There's even photos of the boxes like in all the different places in the indictment not even like in the case.

82
00:05:40,511 --> 00:05:47,479
Scott: They're in the indictment itself in black and white with my very limited Untrained not lawyer legal knowledge.

83
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:54,527
Scott: I'm pretty sure that any Federal charges they always have to have grand juries for federal charges.

84
00:05:54,547 --> 00:05:55,009
Scott: Isn't that right?

85
00:05:55,430 --> 00:06:01,990
Rym: I know and in fact the grand jury made the decision to indict independent of what any prosecutor wanted to do exactly.

86
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:08,154
Scott: So, I don't know people who aren't in the u.s I don't know if you have grand juries But what they are is basically but you know You're gonna have a trial.

87
00:06:08,194 --> 00:06:11,810
Scott: if someone's a criminal you're gonna have a trial to determine if they're guilty or not guilty.

88
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:13,676
Scott: You have two lawyer two sets of lawyers.

89
00:06:13,937 --> 00:06:15,041
Scott: all the evidence comes out.

90
00:06:15,061 --> 00:06:23,453
Scott: There's a judge this jury you present your case You cross examine the witnesses and you get the other case and the jury has to basically with be Unanimous.

91
00:06:23,513 --> 00:06:28,170
Rym: and the jury is like are you absolutely guilty or is there doubt, right?

92
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,158
Scott: There's always gonna be a standard in the u.s.

93
00:06:30,218 --> 00:06:33,090
Scott: The standard for crimes is beyond reasonable doubt, right?

94
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:37,364
Scott: Anyway, but there's a grand jury and so it's for certain things.

95
00:06:37,685 --> 00:06:46,731
Scott: before you do the regular trial You have this grand jury where basically the prosecutors right the people who work for the government right that the law the you know The cops.

96
00:06:46,892 --> 00:06:47,112
Rym: now

97
00:06:47,714 --> 00:07:03,740
Scott: the cop lawyer right gets a bunch of people together, you know normal people and he's like, here's all the evidence I got about that former guy and the crimes he did right and he's basically like do all you people think That I should go and try to have a real trial.

98
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,804
Scott: Yeah, right like.

99
00:07:04,884 --> 00:07:09,001
Scott: and if they say if they say right They're like they're like, you know, it's basically sort of like.

100
00:07:09,503 --> 00:07:13,117
Scott: hey if this was a real trial Do you think I could get a guilty right?

101
00:07:13,338 --> 00:07:14,101
Scott: Do you think right?

102
00:07:14,141 --> 00:07:15,566
Scott: should we press charges?

103
00:07:15,646 --> 00:07:16,770
Scott: Which charges should we press?

104
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:17,513
Scott: How about this one?

105
00:07:17,633 --> 00:07:18,477
Scott: Do you think he did that?

106
00:07:18,558 --> 00:07:19,321
Scott: or do you think right?

107
00:07:19,723 --> 00:07:21,130
Scott: and then the grand jury decides?

108
00:07:21,591 --> 00:07:31,910
Rym: You know what you can and it's a really important check because this way if someone is very like likely not guilty The grand jury is like this case doesn't make sense.

109
00:07:31,974 --> 00:07:38,908
Scott: Yeah Don't you don't waste our government's time and money having a trial for that crime when you got that flimsy evidence.

110
00:07:38,928 --> 00:07:39,610
Scott: get this out of here.

111
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:49,744
Rym: Yeah also don't waste time of the person you're trying to indict and don't like slander them effectively by Announcing this charge and then they just get thrown out in court.

112
00:07:49,985 --> 00:07:50,729
Rym: It's a pretty good check.

113
00:07:51,272 --> 00:07:53,461
Rym: The fact that they got a grand jury to be like the fact right.

114
00:07:53,481 --> 00:08:12,130
Scott: so when you get a grand jury to not only say Yes, you should do this trial but to say yes to this huge pile of charges and counts Yeah, right means that whatever they showed the grand jury Evidence-wise must have been very convincing and therefore it is also likely to be very convincing to a regular jury.

115
00:08:12,411 --> 00:08:16,669
Rym: Yep, and the last thing I'll leave you all with is this one alone.

116
00:08:17,672 --> 00:08:24,890
Rym: The maximum sentence for these 37 charges and this one indictment is a little over 100 years in federal prison.

117
00:08:25,473 --> 00:08:26,639
Scott: Yeah, don't do federal crime.

118
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,730
Rym: Yeah, one of my favorite folks lately.

119
00:08:28,851 --> 00:08:34,585
Rym: I don't even know where I got it from or if I made it up But as your lawyer, I advise you to not have done the things that you did.

120
00:08:34,605 --> 00:08:35,549
Scott: That's right.

121
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,038
Scott: So the federal crime don't do it.

122
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:40,121
Rym: and some other news.

123
00:08:40,504 --> 00:08:50,143
Scott: there's been a string of Important famous or well-known people dying recently Alright, so let's do some some chronological order here cuz we got goods and bads, right?

124
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:57,784
Scott: So first one right sad news The Iron Sheik, so if you don't know the Iron Sheik, he was a professional wrestler.

125
00:08:58,467 --> 00:08:59,430
Scott: is his history, right?

126
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:02,643
Scott: He came from Iran right back in the 70s 80s.

127
00:09:02,683 --> 00:09:04,270
Scott: I forget the exact year, right?

128
00:09:04,631 --> 00:09:12,370
Scott: He was actually like this really like his life story is pretty amazing But you know what he did it in pro wrestling like at the time.

129
00:09:12,993 --> 00:09:14,079
Scott: It's like he was just sort of.

130
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:18,070
Scott: you know, he started out as like a good guy But then he basically turned into the bad guy, right?

131
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:26,039
Scott: Yeah, and I guess in some ways that you know sort of stoked right some Islamophobia Right at the time period right.

132
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:28,730
Scott: and Hulk Hogan was always like played his real American song.

133
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:33,840
Scott: We have American flags and shit right but it's like Iron Sheik was really good at it, right?

134
00:09:35,931 --> 00:09:37,396
Scott: But over time right.

135
00:09:37,497 --> 00:09:41,310
Scott: it's like, you know, his his contributions and his talents who are more recognized.

136
00:09:41,431 --> 00:09:46,092
Scott: But of course like anyone in pro wrestling especially back in those days, you know It did.

137
00:09:46,132 --> 00:09:49,910
Scott: his reward for his work was not great.

138
00:09:50,271 --> 00:09:56,730
Rym: You know most pro wrestlers the reward for their work is dementia caused by head trauma and poverty, right?

139
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,495
Scott: He was also, you know helped.

140
00:09:58,535 --> 00:10:01,294
Scott: there was a Twitter account that you know Let's.

141
00:10:01,455 --> 00:10:02,625
Scott: he didn't run the Twitter account.

142
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:16,630
Scott: That's right It's me but the Twitter account while it was a funny which is good never hurts to be funny But be I think helped, you know promote his existence and appreciation of the person even though he wasn't the one doing those tweets.

143
00:10:16,954 --> 00:10:20,264
Scott: Yeah, so But yeah, he passed away.

144
00:10:20,344 --> 00:10:21,028
Scott: It's very sad.

145
00:10:22,133 --> 00:10:22,434
Scott: You can.

146
00:10:22,615 --> 00:10:24,683
Scott: there's plenty of information if you want to learn about him.

147
00:10:24,804 --> 00:10:29,390
Scott: Okay on the list of graves to drag your behind on.

148
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:36,408
Scott: Pat Robertson noted I guess I don't want a piece of shit maybe like pile of diarrhea.

149
00:10:36,468 --> 00:10:36,830
Scott: I don't know.

150
00:10:38,052 --> 00:10:42,129
Scott: So this dude was basically a right-wing Christian nut job.

151
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:51,042
Rym: He is almost personally responsible for the rise of the political Is a right in him is a significant a significant contributor.

152
00:10:51,082 --> 00:11:05,518
Scott: He had this TV show and basically on TV in a lot of places like on the weekend He would just be sitting there right and all these Christian people would be watching him And he would say all kinds of awful shit

153
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:11,577
Rym: like really crazy stuff about witches are like indoctrinating your kids right.

154
00:11:11,717 --> 00:11:17,180
Scott: all that like everything that you like think of is like stereotypes of well, not stereotypes.

155
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:21,739
Scott: truth right of Right-wing Christian nutty people like Pokemon is the devil.

156
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:23,624
Scott: D&D would do this right.

157
00:11:23,925 --> 00:11:25,530
Scott: gay people are going to hell etc.

158
00:11:25,855 --> 00:11:31,570
Scott: All right Every racist every ist in the universe is embodied within this dude.

159
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:36,144
Rym: He poisoned like a whole generation of American adults minds, right?

160
00:11:36,886 --> 00:11:37,528
Scott: And now he's dead.

161
00:11:37,569 --> 00:11:42,227
Scott: good Obviously, I don't think there's a hell but he believed in one.

162
00:11:42,247 --> 00:11:58,041
Rym: Yeah I hope he was right so that he could go there, you know There's a culture book where there's a society that when someone dies they copy their brain And if they decide they were a bad person they put them in a virtual hell forever Mm-hmm.

163
00:11:59,614 --> 00:12:03,890
Scott: So I guess the third person a sad story again, right?

164
00:12:04,912 --> 00:12:06,719
Scott: At the young age of 38, right?

165
00:12:07,382 --> 00:12:09,250
Scott: Ian McGinty has passed away.

166
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:17,938
Scott: If you don't know who Ian McGinty is he was a comic artist who also worked, you know on Adventure time being puppycat invaders.

167
00:12:17,978 --> 00:12:27,221
Scott: right things you've heard of right and by all accounts everyone I know who's ever, you know, I guess worked with him Talked to him, right?

168
00:12:27,241 --> 00:12:28,570
Scott: I do know people who've worked with him.

169
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:43,398
Scott: Basically, he was just like, you know, one of those people that like everybody loves like the greatest dude right ever And he worked in comics and his final tweet somehow Poetically and soul-crushingly was like like.

170
00:12:43,538 --> 00:13:00,481
Scott: I just want to make comics with everybody right like that kind of person and It's probably you know, I don't know his exact cause of Death but you know the discussions that people have been having online are basically like yeah, you know Obviously comics don't pay.

171
00:13:00,522 --> 00:13:01,550
Scott: well, right?

172
00:13:02,371 --> 00:13:15,410
Scott: You know and this dude was like overworking himself making lots and lots of comics and definitely every comic artist I know over works themselves for almost no money Right, and I mean, you know, there is valid criticism to be had.

173
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:19,804
Scott: I wrote this in the forum of the comic publishers who do not compensate artists.

174
00:13:19,884 --> 00:13:23,547
Scott: Well, that's been true since uh, Comic books were a thing, right?

175
00:13:24,552 --> 00:13:26,544
Scott: Marvel was not you know, Jack Kirby.

176
00:13:26,565 --> 00:13:27,390
Scott: You can go all the way back.

177
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:33,550
Scott: You can go in further back than that right to find comic book artists in the US and Japan and anywhere else.

178
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:38,384
Scott: I guess maybe in France you you you get okay with your you know, bond sna whatever.

179
00:13:38,404 --> 00:13:50,187
Scott: I don't know how they're compensated but Yeah, it's not a you know, the fact is is that yes, the publishers aren't treating people Well, but the reality is that there just isn't enough money to treat people.

180
00:13:50,227 --> 00:14:00,930
Rym: Well, yeah across the board everywhere not just in comics, but there's so many industries where Society values something but not individuals don't value it enough to pay much of anything for it.

181
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:01,832
Scott: think about the Imagine.

182
00:14:01,892 --> 00:14:09,816
Scott: if I started if I tried to start a comic book publisher the the best one I would just the nicest Does everything the cool legit way?

183
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:15,110
Scott: I treat my labor like the best way right that whatever is I give them amazing deals, right?

184
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:17,199
Scott: It's like okay, so people buy comics.

185
00:14:17,239 --> 00:14:17,863
Scott: I get revenue.

186
00:14:18,184 --> 00:14:27,250
Scott: Well, I got to pay for the printing I got to pay for the advertising I got to pay for all the staff Salaries right the editors myself, of course, and I could have paid myself zero, right?

187
00:14:27,731 --> 00:14:32,250
Scott: Yeah, even I'm not paying myself millions though like an evil person just a regular amount, you know.

188
00:14:33,252 --> 00:14:36,670
Scott: So we take all the costs out of doing business, right?

189
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:48,518
Scott: you know insurance all the things you need for a business the electricity and Then I take the all the rest of the revenues from the comic book that sold and I divide it fairly Among the actual artists who worked on that book.

190
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:55,090
Scott: right eat unless the book is some ridiculous Crazy bestseller, right?

191
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:58,152
Scott: They're not gonna be making a lot of money Right.

192
00:14:58,333 --> 00:14:58,835
Scott: Yeah, it's just.

193
00:14:59,136 --> 00:15:02,067
Scott: it just isn't that much money for them to be.

194
00:15:02,127 --> 00:15:02,529
Rym: look at us.

195
00:15:02,549 --> 00:15:02,810
Rym: think of it.

196
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:03,915
Rym: I would eat that there's a video game.

197
00:15:03,975 --> 00:15:08,572
Scott: even if it sells really well, it won't be enough unless it sells extremely well.

198
00:15:08,592 --> 00:15:11,382
Rym: think about a video game that's pretty good and you look at it.

199
00:15:11,422 --> 00:15:12,185
Rym: you think you know what.

200
00:15:12,566 --> 00:15:15,788
Rym: if that were cheaper like If it was a dollar I might buy it.

201
00:15:16,793 --> 00:15:18,962
Scott: Yeah, so so sad story.

202
00:15:19,023 --> 00:15:20,770
Scott: the passing of Ian McGinty.

203
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:24,218
Scott: Okay, not sad story again, right person who?

204
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,283
Rym: I have a guess who the next one is.

205
00:15:26,303 --> 00:15:27,266
Rym: I haven't seen your list.

206
00:15:27,967 --> 00:15:29,918
Scott: Oh, there's a Mr.

207
00:15:30,321 --> 00:15:40,887
Scott: Noted mathematician The park headline was famous mathematician has died Yeah, so if you weren't around in the 90s, you might not remember the 80s.

208
00:15:42,092 --> 00:15:46,010
Scott: Yeah, but there was basically, you know, this this mystery there's a Unabomber.

209
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:51,530
Scott: They called him the Unabomber because he was bombing sending bombs like two universities, right?

210
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:57,270
Rym: Like it's our universities and airlines like the CEO and airline was killed by one of these true.

211
00:15:57,352 --> 00:16:05,389
Scott: so basically someone just like sending bombs in the mail and you like open up the mail and a bomb goes off and Many people were severely injured.

212
00:16:05,972 --> 00:16:13,815
Scott: Some people were literally killed by opening up and there was a bomb and it went off when they opened the thing and actually worked over the span of 17 years.

213
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,938
Rym: he was getting away with this to the point that it was.

214
00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:25,945
Rym: it was one of those things that like everyone in America knew about this guy and was Low-key like either afraid of them or like would think about it a little bit when like a.

215
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:35,559
Scott: well if you were in up as you Know an airline, you know You know like an academic that might draw it similar to the other people who had received them Then you might be afraid and want to check your mail right.

216
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:36,542
Scott: normal people weren't?

217
00:16:36,743 --> 00:16:39,093
Scott: it's like it wasn't gonna bomb, you know It's me.

218
00:16:39,254 --> 00:16:40,242
Rym: Well, it was more than he was in.

219
00:16:40,302 --> 00:16:41,370
Rym: it was in the news a lot.

220
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,080
Rym: So people had undue fear.

221
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,690
Scott: because it's such a story, right?

222
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:47,070
Scott: It's like people are getting bombs in the mail and dying.

223
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,127
Scott: Where are they coming from?

224
00:16:48,651 --> 00:16:53,390
Rym: Right and to get away with it for 17 years and then the way he got caught was actually kind of nuts.

225
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:54,153
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

226
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:57,931
Scott: it's like such a mystery right like the zodiac killer mystery or you know The?

227
00:16:58,232 --> 00:16:58,955
Scott: you know, what's a good?

228
00:16:58,995 --> 00:16:59,618
Scott: Jack the Ripper?

229
00:16:59,658 --> 00:17:00,140
Scott: the mystery?

230
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:00,702
Scott: Who was it?

231
00:17:00,783 --> 00:17:01,064
Scott: Right?

232
00:17:01,466 --> 00:17:01,686
Scott: Who's?

233
00:17:01,867 --> 00:17:02,510
Scott: who's doing this?

234
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:05,117
Scott: We can tell by the evidence by the patterns.

235
00:17:05,398 --> 00:17:07,165
Scott: It's definitely the same person doing this.

236
00:17:07,265 --> 00:17:08,690
Scott: It's not it's a repeat offender.

237
00:17:08,911 --> 00:17:09,313
Scott: Yeah, right.

238
00:17:09,634 --> 00:17:14,586
Scott: It's like, you know the same reason people love Silence of the Lambs Like this is like a real-life.

239
00:17:15,174 --> 00:17:16,530
Rym: I think there's an extra weird thing.

240
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:25,298
Rym: The thing that was going on that made this one scary to a lot of people was that unlike most crazy stuff like this Most criminals aren't that careful or that good.

241
00:17:25,338 --> 00:17:27,444
Rym: there aren't like criminal masterminds out there who write.

242
00:17:27,523 --> 00:17:29,470
Scott: most people who try to bomb things.

243
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:32,189
Scott: They're not smart and their bombs hurt themselves or don't work.

244
00:17:37,571 --> 00:17:41,713
Scott: It's very rare for someone to be good enough and evil enough right.

245
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:52,788
Scott: usually someone who's smart enough to like make a bomb that can go through the mail and go off at the right Time and work is a smart intelligent person who that could succeed in society and wouldn't do that.

246
00:17:54,071 --> 00:18:07,297
Scott: It's very rare that you have this combination of evil and smart enough to do evil, yep possibly crazy because the reasons he bombed were Yeah, shall we say like.

247
00:18:07,317 --> 00:18:08,341
Rym: this is not a documentary.

248
00:18:08,362 --> 00:18:10,190
Rym: you can watch a documentary if you're read Wikipedia.

249
00:18:10,351 --> 00:18:12,403
Scott: But basically when they caught him it was a huge.

250
00:18:12,443 --> 00:18:13,670
Scott: it was like the biggest news.

251
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,175
Scott: It was like 20 was like ever.

252
00:18:15,296 --> 00:18:19,310
Scott: all the news is talking about this for days and days and days when they finally caught this.

253
00:18:19,752 --> 00:18:27,728
Rym: You know and I remember because I was in high school When like the trial was gonna happen and he just played guilty like he didn't try to hide any of it.

254
00:18:27,768 --> 00:18:28,932
Rym: when they caught him He was like, yep.

255
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:30,638
Rym: I was a bomber.

256
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,248
Rym: Let's talk about why I bombed like.

257
00:18:33,388 --> 00:18:33,790
Rym: let's go.

258
00:18:36,431 --> 00:18:38,176
Scott: So, yeah f that guy.

259
00:18:38,196 --> 00:18:40,301
Scott: yeah, he was weird Herman in the woods.

260
00:18:40,361 --> 00:18:48,288
Scott: interesting story for like, you know TV but You know, I think that often distracts people from the fact that no that was an evil dude.

261
00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:52,942
Scott: Yeah He died in prison right where he wasn't gonna get out of that prison ever.

262
00:18:53,043 --> 00:18:54,990
Scott: Anyway, so he was gonna die there eventually.

263
00:18:57,275 --> 00:19:03,470
Scott: Yeah, okay the next right we have someone I've heard of which is the author Cormac McCarthy.

264
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:07,220
Scott: I've heard many people talk about these books.

265
00:19:07,421 --> 00:19:09,590
Scott: I think some of them have been turned into movies, but you know what?

266
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,622
Scott: I've never read them maybe but ever I've read the road.

267
00:19:12,663 --> 00:19:14,310
Rym: That's the only one I've heard of the road.

268
00:19:14,452 --> 00:19:15,389
Scott: I know that that is a book.

269
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:19,889
Scott: I know that there is a book called the road by Cormac McCarthy and that is where my knowledge ends.

270
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:25,789
Rym: It's uh a lot of post-apocalyptic stuff cribs pretty like that from it.

271
00:19:25,829 --> 00:19:32,190
Rym: Yeah It's got some problems like it's a it's a fine book and it broke some new ground.

272
00:19:32,411 --> 00:19:34,965
Rym: But it's also got some significant problems.

273
00:19:35,005 --> 00:19:35,769
Rym: is what I'm gonna say.

274
00:19:36,574 --> 00:19:36,815
Scott: Okay.

275
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:42,404
Scott: Well regardless this is a person who is making aforementioned bestsellers enough money to do.

276
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:52,630
Scott: well You know clearly a lot of people, you know had you know Very strong positive feelings towards many of his works and I don't know anything else about it.

277
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:57,869
Scott: It's just a huge famous person who's on the list of people who've died in like the last week.

278
00:19:59,972 --> 00:20:03,081
Scott: So next right a really sad one, right.

279
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:12,690
Scott: so John Romita senior if people don't know All right, spider-man was by Stanley obviously and Steve Ditko was the artist, right?

280
00:20:13,158 --> 00:20:17,421
Scott: Steve Ditko Had a mysterious fight with Stan Lee.

281
00:20:17,441 --> 00:20:35,578
Scott: Alright, no one knows exactly what they fought over But after so many issues of spider-man They they split right and Steve Ditko went to go be a hermit who hid away in an office writing libertarian weirdo Comics, that's a charitable way to describe that.

282
00:20:35,618 --> 00:20:46,450
Scott: but yeah, I Steve Ditko is amazing artist And I and by all accounts, I guess according to Neil Gaiman and other people who've met him like a nice guy to meet.

283
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:48,980
Scott: Yeah, I think he died a while ago.

284
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,743
Scott: or is he still alive?

285
00:20:49,763 --> 00:20:50,325
Scott: I don't remember.

286
00:20:50,947 --> 00:20:55,860
Scott: but regardless After Steve Ditko left spider-man Stan Lee's 18.

287
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,542
Rym: He passed away.

288
00:20:56,943 --> 00:20:57,124
Scott: Okay.

289
00:20:57,164 --> 00:21:01,915
Scott: I thought I remember him anyway after Steve Ditko left spider-man.

290
00:21:01,935 --> 00:21:02,195
Scott: He's like.

291
00:21:02,215 --> 00:21:07,230
Scott: well spider-man is the biggest thing since sliced bread in 1960 early 70s whenever that was, right?

292
00:21:07,452 --> 00:21:08,383
Scott: It was only a few years.

293
00:21:08,545 --> 00:21:09,793
Scott: in meanwhile No worthy.

294
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:13,630
Rym: in the year 2023 the previous episode of GeekNights spider-man is still the biggest thing since sliced bread.

295
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:14,336
Scott: That's right.

296
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:17,674
Scott: Spider-man is the thing Stan Lee's like shit.

297
00:21:17,714 --> 00:21:19,862
Scott: I got to get someone to draw this spider-man, right?

298
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:23,030
Rym: I need someone to draw pictures of spider-man That's right.

299
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:39,870
Scott: So he found this guy right John Romita and John Romita was basically doing like romance comics over at DC Right and if you look at his romance comics like you can see why You know Whatever criticism you want to have a Stan Lee, right?

300
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:42,718
Scott: It's like he was able to recognize that.

301
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:47,130
Scott: you know, this guy who was doing romance comics in that style, right?

302
00:21:47,450 --> 00:22:08,909
Scott: You know doing not so much the action right of the other comic artists, right or like the wild stuff like Jack Kirby was doing right, but It's like that, you know soap opera emotion is what spider-man needed and so and you know John Romita was just gonna go and do like advertising work, right and make a bunch of money.

303
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:12,663
Scott: Stan Lee was like I will pay you whatever they're gonna pay you.

304
00:22:12,703 --> 00:22:14,510
Scott: I'll match the salary, right?

305
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:17,909
Scott: You're the guy I need you to be the guy to draw the spider-man.

306
00:22:18,592 --> 00:22:23,270
Scott: All right, and John Romita senior went on to draw spider-man for like a very long time.

307
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,858
Rym: They probably like he was part of that.

308
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:26,970
Rym: He was part of the creation of Wolverine.

309
00:22:28,052 --> 00:22:30,649
Scott: He was yeah, he was probably Mary Jane, right?

310
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:33,314
Scott: Punisher Yeah, it's like.

311
00:22:33,595 --> 00:22:40,874
Scott: this is an incredibly significant and important person in comics history in the US And the thing is.

312
00:22:40,915 --> 00:22:44,110
Scott: it's like, you know, if you think about comic artists, right?

313
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:51,651
Scott: It's like a lot of them have like a unique Style to them and you can sort of see their style like oh, you know, you see like something that's all like a huge oil Painting.

314
00:22:51,671 --> 00:22:53,156
Scott: it's like oh, it's an Alex Ross right?

315
00:22:53,176 --> 00:22:54,962
Scott: You see some wild thing.

316
00:22:55,003 --> 00:22:59,830
Scott: It's like oh, it's a that's a Bill Sienkiewicz over there right, but it's like John Romita.

317
00:23:00,792 --> 00:23:04,190
Scott: The way he draws is like the default way.

318
00:23:04,651 --> 00:23:08,041
Scott: It's like, you know everyone else right in comics.

319
00:23:08,081 --> 00:23:09,686
Scott: It was like remixing him.

320
00:23:09,746 --> 00:23:11,671
Scott: He was like the original track It's.

321
00:23:11,732 --> 00:23:16,686
Scott: obviously he didn't invent spider-man right and to an extent extent when he started out.

322
00:23:16,747 --> 00:23:21,065
Scott: He was trying to like, you know maintain the same style that Ditko had started.

323
00:23:21,085 --> 00:23:28,150
Scott: but It's like you know, you see like a picture of spider-man and it's like that's what spider-man normally looks like.

324
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:30,621
Scott: It's like no, that's spider-man.

325
00:23:30,802 --> 00:23:36,330
Scott: the way John Romita draws spider-man He just right is the way in the normal way, right?

326
00:23:37,191 --> 00:23:53,194
Scott: So to be that good at art that your way ends up being the defining way Like that's the default style that everyone else is building upon you right is is I think not Appreciated enough.

327
00:23:53,295 --> 00:23:55,122
Rym: Oh, yeah kingpin - yeah.

328
00:23:55,704 --> 00:23:57,090
Scott: Yeah all these right.

329
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:59,260
Scott: It's like this is like reading.

330
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:03,898
Scott: and then so the other thing is that he had a child Right who is known as jr.

331
00:24:03,939 --> 00:24:04,340
Scott: Jr.

332
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,363
Scott: John Romita jr.

333
00:24:05,966 --> 00:24:12,161
Scott: Who also became Perhaps an equally legendary comic artist right and is still alive.

334
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:14,948
Scott: He went into dad's family business, right?

335
00:24:14,988 --> 00:24:22,060
Scott: So The Romita family is truly You know, I don't think you would have yeah would.

336
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:26,239
Scott: I don't think you'd have any of the Marvel shit you got now Right Disney wouldn't own it.

337
00:24:26,541 --> 00:24:27,910
Scott: It wouldn't be movies, right?

338
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:28,993
Scott: It wouldn't have become as big.

339
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:37,520
Scott: right because like what if Stan Lee after Ditko dropped out spider-man after a few years Right had had to get someone else who had some different style.

340
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,302
Scott: Yeah, right.

341
00:24:38,322 --> 00:24:42,155
Rym: instead of it's like iconic consistent style Right.

342
00:24:42,718 --> 00:24:44,549
Scott: It's like what would spider-man it?

343
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:57,686
Scott: you know might have ended up just being a fad of the times or it might have been a lesser intellectual property that comes and goes now and then like a Transformers my little pony level of you know instead of being a universally recognized thing.

344
00:24:57,707 --> 00:24:58,429
Scott: Mm-hmm.

345
00:24:58,549 --> 00:25:10,427
Scott: So Very sad the passing of John Romita and I think those are all the people have died But which is amazing because somehow fucking Henry Kissinger is still alive.

346
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:26,583
Scott: We can talk about that But I would the thing I want to talk about is that The a lot of these people who passed away right their ages were in 80s 90s, right except for You know Ian McGouty, right?

347
00:25:26,603 --> 00:25:29,995
Scott: And so these people are Boomers, right.

348
00:25:30,517 --> 00:25:33,670
Scott: and what we call the boomers because there was a baby boom.

349
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:45,490
Scott: There was a period of time in America where more after the war a lot of people made babies more babies Than at other times more babies than the previous generation and the following generations, right?

350
00:25:45,931 --> 00:25:53,964
Scott: So because a large portion, you know, if you look at how many people in the u.s Are in a certain age right group, right?

351
00:25:54,325 --> 00:25:59,479
Scott: That's the biggest one Except for the fact that now they're old right they're dying.

352
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:03,530
Scott: But if there's more of them, you'll see more of them dying.

353
00:26:04,293 --> 00:26:06,601
Rym: It's the biggest generation in American history.

354
00:26:06,621 --> 00:26:09,010
Rym: a high percent of them are at the end of their ticket, right?

355
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:12,730
Scott: So when they start dying, you will see more of them dying, you know.

356
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:24,103
Scott: And you know a number of famous people that are in that category is also greater because presumably the number of famous people is Evenly distributed across, you know population, right?

357
00:26:24,123 --> 00:26:25,387
Scott: So you got so.

358
00:26:25,688 --> 00:26:27,654
Scott: therefore Right your.

359
00:26:27,714 --> 00:26:31,704
Scott: I think this is a trend that will just continue on a mathematical basis.

360
00:26:31,905 --> 00:26:32,707
Scott: Yeah, right is?

361
00:26:32,747 --> 00:26:52,683
Scott: you are going to see more frequent celebrity death news of Celebrities who are of that generation until they're all gone and then the slit the rate of celebrity death news is will decrease to match the population of Gen X and this is above and beyond lower the usual.

362
00:26:52,723 --> 00:26:53,486
Rym: like we're like.

363
00:26:53,546 --> 00:27:06,043
Rym: I'm 40 so Most of the famous people I could name are probably about twice as old as me because they were an institution in my life up To this point, so they're all at the end of their tickets too.

364
00:27:06,404 --> 00:27:07,367
Rym: But this isn't.

365
00:27:07,467 --> 00:27:12,823
Rym: this is now come Doubled by the baby boomer situation.

366
00:27:13,084 --> 00:27:14,389
Rym: I didn't even think about the boomers.

367
00:27:15,236 --> 00:27:24,177
Scott: yep, so that's and That's you know, it's bad because obviously, you know of the people we listed Several of them were good.

368
00:27:24,278 --> 00:27:37,247
Scott: It's not like you're a bad person just because you're that old but It bodes well because Overall mathematically speaking that generation of people leans Politically in the direction we don't like.

369
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:37,630
Scott: yep.

370
00:27:37,831 --> 00:27:43,612
Scott: And if enough of them die and we don't then that bodes well for election results especially

371
00:27:43,632 --> 00:27:55,450
Rym: because that is a generation that has categorically held on to power and Jobs and wealth more so than generations up to that point to the point that that's why Gen X was so frequently.

372
00:27:55,591 --> 00:28:04,270
Rym: So fucked up because they kind of got skipped over like all the Gen Xers Hit the top of their careers and then some boomer was their boss who didn't retire so they had nowhere to go.

373
00:28:04,471 --> 00:28:05,294
Rym: They couldn't be promoted.

374
00:28:06,078 --> 00:28:08,509
Scott: Yeah, and it was still boomers.

375
00:28:09,111 --> 00:28:22,147
Scott: Yeah, so not only will the election results be swayed by these, you know mortality But also right when those boomers die, you know, they're there and they might have inheritors.

376
00:28:22,668 --> 00:28:23,190
Scott: It's likely.

377
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:31,661
Scott: but even if they don't right that wealth goes to the state or wherever they Willed it to go some trust or organization or who knows.

378
00:28:32,083 --> 00:28:46,284
Scott: but at least it will be free of them And there will be some increasing downward pressure of the wealth finally coming, you know, it's like Okay from your cold dead hands here we got it.

379
00:28:46,585 --> 00:28:59,642
Rym: when a whale dies It sinks to the bottom of the sea and all those resources get redistributed exactly, so it's that will benefit society in a hidden way particularly when Kissinger finally bites it.

380
00:28:59,682 --> 00:29:04,704
Rym: because I wonder Waypo just had an article that I'll link to because it's just great.

381
00:29:05,046 --> 00:29:09,159
Rym: but at the time the title is just Henry Kissinger is turning a hundred.

382
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:19,150
Rym: a long-running meme wishes otherwise and it goes into detail about How Millennials and younger hate Kissinger and it's justified like fuck him.

383
00:29:19,672 --> 00:29:25,590
Scott: So yeah, like I want to if you don't know like I mean if you want to talk about, you know We're talking about Trump II crimes, right?

384
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:40,230
Scott: It's like, you know what Trump did a lot of crimes and deserves many consequences for those crimes and has damaged society greatly right, but Kissinger did more of the war crimes right crimes against humanity.

385
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:41,858
Rym: I mean Trump might had.

386
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,090
Scott: Trump might have done some of those while he was in office.

387
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:44,772
Scott: Well here we go.

388
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:46,055
Scott: Is he mostly?

389
00:29:46,095 --> 00:29:51,470
Scott: he's done the financial crimes when W's invaded Iraq for no reason.

390
00:29:51,751 --> 00:29:59,082
Rym: You know the second time like when there was no reason to do it tons of war crimes happened And that was a horrible situation and they should have been tried in the hog.

391
00:29:59,444 --> 00:30:03,687
Rym: But yep at the same time Yeah, but at the same time am I saying it right?

392
00:30:03,708 --> 00:30:07,084
Rym: Yeah, hey Okay, I just saw I like almost swallowed.

393
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:08,010
Rym: I had like a phlegm.

394
00:30:08,851 --> 00:30:23,141
Rym: Hi I never heard of the high but the collected war crimes of the US Iraq invasion as horrific as they were pale in comparison to what happened because Henry Kissinger opened his fucking mouth.

395
00:30:23,523 --> 00:30:24,730
Rym: I'm gonna read one short quote.

396
00:30:25,052 --> 00:30:27,190
Rym: I don't want to dwell on it because we want to get into the rest of the show.

397
00:30:27,954 --> 00:30:37,390
Rym: But this is a quote you will never guess who said this Once you've been to Cambodia, you'll never stop wanting to beat Henry Kissinger to death with your bare hands.

398
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:48,990
Rym: You will never again be able to open a newspaper and read about that treacherous prevaricating murderous scumbag Sitting down for a nice chat with Charlie Rose or attending some black-tie affair for a new glossy magazine without choking.

399
00:30:49,532 --> 00:30:59,022
Rym: Witness what Henry did in Cambodia the fruits of his genius for statesmanship and you will never Understand why he's not sitting and in the dock at the Hague next to Milosevic.

400
00:30:59,383 --> 00:31:02,655
Rym: and that is a quote from Anthony Bourdain The chef.

401
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,425
Scott: Oh, yeah, that makes sense.

402
00:31:04,506 --> 00:31:14,548
Scott: Yeah so he can't last that much longer and It's he is like you got when you have money and power that helps you last longer like.

403
00:31:14,568 --> 00:31:22,530
Rym: at this point I think only Vladimir Putin might be like a person a human being who is still alive who has committed more total war crimes.

404
00:31:24,973 --> 00:31:25,883
Rym: Maybe there's got to be some.

405
00:31:26,733 --> 00:31:34,616
Scott: so there's a lot of You know, there's like a lot of really shitty dictators that people don't pay attention to because you know Like like, you know you get down to.

406
00:31:34,636 --> 00:31:49,667
Rym: like Eritrea like the president of Eritrea is like is like the worst Nevermind And even yeah, so now Hussein did not deserve what happened to him and Iraq shouldn't have been invaded But he was still an absolute war criminal who deserves lots of war crime.

407
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:57,009
Scott: Yep I mean, I guess I don't know who you want to lay things on like, you know, China and the Uyghurs and yeah

408
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:59,453
Rym: but Kissinger the

409
00:32:00,196 --> 00:32:00,296
Scott: the

410
00:32:00,416 --> 00:32:09,550
Rym: most amazing thing is despite the fact that he's turning a hundred he seems to still 100% defend everything he did as moral and just and right and fuck the haters.

411
00:32:10,632 --> 00:32:15,954
Scott: Well, I mean if you didn't change when you were 40 What makes you?

412
00:32:16,094 --> 00:32:20,389
Scott: why would you ever expect something to change when they're like 90 your war crimes in your 40s.

413
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:31,358
Rym: He didn't change it when you were 80 and now you're 100 but anyway things of the day.

414
00:32:31,659 --> 00:32:46,707
Rym: so, uh, you know play video games play D&D just Anything about history and you know vaguely that slings are a thing, you know call a rope You kind of swing it around and you can throw a rock real hard with it and you can throw that.

415
00:32:46,768 --> 00:32:48,296
Scott: David and Goliath Come up.

416
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:55,948
Rym: or like any medieval or Roman military game where there's slinger units even fantasy empires had the hot.

417
00:32:56,229 --> 00:32:58,737
Rym: the It had the halfling slingers was a unit.

418
00:32:58,757 --> 00:33:02,910
Scott: you can recruit my very first second ed character cleric, right?

419
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:06,764
Scott: You couldn't use an edged weapon for some reason at a club in a sling.

420
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:08,470
Scott: I had I had a sling.

421
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:18,870
Rym: I just yeah, and the most famous and prolific kind of sling in the world is probably the Balearic sling Which is the one you're all imagining when you think of a sling other.

422
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:19,372
Scott: It's a couple.

423
00:33:19,513 --> 00:33:23,470
Scott: it's a couple strings and a piece of leather and you put a rock in it and you swing it around.

424
00:33:23,771 --> 00:33:36,697
Rym: So it is an ancient ancient ancient thing and there is like you could spend your entire life studying just this one Invention of humans possibly even invented Prehuman like.

425
00:33:36,757 --> 00:33:38,588
Rym: that's the level of monkeys made it.

426
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:43,644
Rym: What I hominid prior to humans may have been involved because it was already a giraffe made one.

427
00:33:43,864 --> 00:33:45,529
Rym: This was already a dinosaur.

428
00:33:47,318 --> 00:33:48,370
Scott: T-rex was out there like

429
00:33:50,072 --> 00:34:11,090
Rym: you know total aside, but I was reading a paper making a strong argument that based on how archaeology has gone so far a society about as advanced as humans Pre-industrialization could have existed before the previous big cataclysm and there would be no evidence of it for us to ever find.

430
00:34:12,532 --> 00:34:13,094
Scott: It's possible.

431
00:34:13,295 --> 00:34:13,918
Rym: It is possible.

432
00:34:14,301 --> 00:34:25,697
Rym: I'm not saying it's plausible or probable but anyway this video in six minutes and 35 seconds will actually explain how this thing works and it's Really really cool how it works.

433
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,310
Scott: I mean, I thought I knew how it worked, but I guess I'll watch it and see if I'm wrong.

434
00:34:29,451 --> 00:34:30,761
Rym: Yep, so it's got a trigger.

435
00:34:30,962 --> 00:34:31,829
Rym: It's kind of like a gun.

436
00:34:32,911 --> 00:34:34,077
Scott: Yeah, yeah, I knew that.

437
00:34:34,297 --> 00:34:34,739
Scott: Yeah, okay.

438
00:34:34,801 --> 00:34:35,786
Rym: Most people I don't think know that.

439
00:34:35,806 --> 00:34:37,571
Scott: All right, we'll see We'll see if I'm right I'm.

440
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:46,507
Rym: so it might be you and I are in the rare demographic of people who know more about this stuff than an average person Mostly because of video games and movies, I guess.

441
00:34:46,527 --> 00:34:48,333
Rym: so What do you got?

442
00:34:49,255 --> 00:35:04,210
Scott: Oh, so you've seen a lot of people especially, you know Astrophotographers, they love to do this one shot where you do a time-lapse Right with it with a big wide-angle lens and you you keep it completely still in a place that doesn't have light pollution.

443
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:06,442
Scott: And what happens is at night, right?

444
00:35:06,522 --> 00:35:06,964
Scott: It's like you get.

445
00:35:07,004 --> 00:35:17,516
Scott: you know, you see the sunrise You see the sunset and you see the stars right up above and then you see that the Milky Way and everything move Across the sky throughout the night.

446
00:35:17,897 --> 00:35:19,482
Scott: and it's not that the stars are moving.

447
00:35:19,622 --> 00:35:22,230
Scott: Oh, they are but it's that the earth is rotating.

448
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:22,813
Scott: Yeah, right.

449
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:34,174
Scott: And therefore you're looking at a different in a different direction in space right in a you know, I guess it's 180 degrees Right.

450
00:35:34,274 --> 00:35:36,429
Scott: because until you get back to the Sun again, right?

451
00:35:37,513 --> 00:35:39,968
Scott: And that's a very common time-lapse that you see.

452
00:35:40,751 --> 00:35:59,530
Scott: But in those time lapses right the earth is always just like at the bottom and like whatever you're looking at the cityscape Usually won't be a cityscape but you know trees or a mountain or it will just be sitting there And it'll change because the light will shine upon it and move but it's sort of just a static bottom of the frame.

453
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:04,342
Scott: So here art universe creative astrophotography.

454
00:36:04,683 --> 00:36:05,666
Scott: Who's the photographer?

455
00:36:06,047 --> 00:36:06,889
Scott: Does it even say?

456
00:36:08,971 --> 00:36:10,237
Scott: Copyright Bartosz Wojcicki.

457
00:36:10,257 --> 00:36:12,308
Scott: I hope I pronounced your name correctly.

458
00:36:12,388 --> 00:36:15,555
Scott: Bartosz Had the genius idea.

459
00:36:15,575 --> 00:36:18,909
Scott: I've never seen this before but it's sort of like obvious once you think about it.

460
00:36:19,471 --> 00:36:33,334
Scott: But instead of locking the camera just on a tripod which means it's stuck to the earth You arrange so that instead the camera is locked at a specific point in the sky Right.

461
00:36:33,635 --> 00:36:46,289
Scott: So now what you have is the same basic time-lapse But the sky doesn't move right the stars stay put and instead you see the earth rotating, right.

462
00:36:48,451 --> 00:37:00,190
Scott: And it's really fascinating to just you know have this idea and then to see it executed and then just to see the night sky Stuck in place because really that is the thing that's stuck in place right and then to see the earth move.

463
00:37:01,911 --> 00:37:06,308
Scott: You know, and I guess if you did this shot at different points in the earth, the rotation would be different.

464
00:37:06,408 --> 00:37:13,953
Rym: Yeah So the closest I've seen I've seen people do this with like stunt tricks where they'll have a GoPro like mounted on their head pointing At their face.

465
00:37:14,215 --> 00:37:22,242
Scott: so the world moves around them, but they're always like locked static instead Right, like if you did this at the North Pole It would be like a static shot basically like nothing would.

466
00:37:22,704 --> 00:37:26,328
Scott: but if you did this at the equator It would be like really wild right?

467
00:37:27,572 --> 00:37:28,908
Scott: It might make you dizzy if you do so.

468
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:32,371
Scott: Good job Bartosz.

469
00:37:32,491 --> 00:37:33,677
Rym: yeah in the meta moment.

470
00:37:33,697 --> 00:37:36,130
Rym: The geek dies book club was the satanic versus it is now.

471
00:37:36,271 --> 00:37:38,984
Rym: This is how you lose the time war as recommended to us.

472
00:37:39,044 --> 00:37:40,150
Scott: I guess I have to make a post.

473
00:37:40,251 --> 00:37:43,129
Rym: I guess you do buy out one Bigelow's dickless wolf would.

474
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:46,899
Rym: Websites coming along Scott's working out a bunch of stuff.

475
00:37:46,959 --> 00:37:52,088
Rym: I'm working on a much smaller piece list of things and We're gonna try to launch it.

476
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:57,450
Rym: I'm not gonna say any dates or schedules out loud on the show, but we've got some plans that are specific.

477
00:37:57,510 --> 00:38:01,869
Scott: But you keep mentioning the person who recommended the time war because it's just a really funny name.

478
00:38:02,792 --> 00:38:06,384
Scott: You should mention the author's Amal El-Moltar and I would.

479
00:38:06,424 --> 00:38:08,170
Rym: I just didn't have it open in my.

480
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:14,690
Rym: I'm just looking at website and I went here because I hoped you'd made the post so I could just read the summary.

481
00:38:14,811 --> 00:38:15,273
Rym: But you didn't.

482
00:38:15,474 --> 00:38:18,228
Scott: so I'll make the post and that will help you remember it.

483
00:38:18,369 --> 00:38:23,227
Rym: well okay, so uh, I think otherwise, let's just get right into it.

484
00:38:23,428 --> 00:38:26,665
Rym: because Airplane food and airline food.

485
00:38:26,685 --> 00:38:27,350
Scott: Yeah, this is art.

486
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:31,689
Scott: This is our new low-effort Thursday idea and we don't have another Thursday idea, right?

487
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:37,489
Scott: We already done so many food episodes, but we realized we can do this combo food plus place, right?

488
00:38:37,569 --> 00:38:44,966
Scott: Yeah So we last time we were gonna do food plus stadium We ended up just doing stadium and that was already a long episode, right?

489
00:38:45,227 --> 00:38:47,034
Scott: So now Rym got the idea.

490
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:48,360
Scott: We'll start with food plus Airport.

491
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,588
Scott: Maybe food plus stadium will come down the line.

492
00:38:50,688 --> 00:38:53,513
Rym: Yeah so, uh One thing I got.

493
00:38:53,914 --> 00:39:01,410
Scott: so this will be anecdotal mostly but I can say that my opinion you want to expand it to food plus Travel so you can do train food also or just do food Airport.

494
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:11,832
Rym: I think we should just do Airport because train food and air and airplane Train food also is such a different experience and I have a lot of very specific long-winded things to say about depends on the train Too.

495
00:39:11,953 --> 00:39:23,910
Rym: Yeah anyway, but what I can say is that Sometime between the 90s and the mid to late 2010s Airplane food just got an order of magnitude better even at the bottom end.

496
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:30,510
Rym: Like I don't know what happened between food science or budgets or what and I'm not saying it got good.

497
00:39:31,173 --> 00:39:42,735
Rym: But if you are too young to have ever eaten food Even in like business class or first class on a domestic American flight Before like in the 90s or the 80s.

498
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:44,901
Rym: It was basically poison.

499
00:39:45,622 --> 00:39:51,176
Scott: Yeah, it used to be like a common joke like, you know Airline food, right?

500
00:39:51,236 --> 00:39:53,805
Scott: It's like is awful the same way that like you'd have that joke.

501
00:39:53,825 --> 00:39:57,414
Scott: We're like kids Brussels sprouts Spinach you right?

502
00:39:57,434 --> 00:39:58,316
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

503
00:39:58,697 --> 00:39:59,219
Scott: we know.

504
00:39:59,259 --> 00:40:04,474
Scott: the reason that we like Brussels sprouts and spinach now is because they are literally not the Same as what people were eating.

505
00:40:04,655 --> 00:40:11,604
Rym: Yeah on the 50s and 60s and basically old food on old airlines Especially in the 80s 90s was basically the same as a TV dinner.

506
00:40:11,624 --> 00:40:15,989
Rym: If you don't know what that is Imagine the worst frozen food on earth.

507
00:40:17,811 --> 00:40:23,510
Scott: Yeah, and so a lot of that is just you know, what's available in terms of food technology, right?

508
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:35,436
Scott: It's like, you know, we've invented a lot of you know, food processing techniques over You know the time that we've had airplanes and there's a lot of constraints when it comes to what kind of food Can you have on a plane right?

509
00:40:35,898 --> 00:40:38,570
Scott: How how long is the flight at the flights longer?

510
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:41,830
Scott: You need food that's gonna be stable for the flight.

511
00:40:42,211 --> 00:40:48,890
Scott: You need a place on the plane right to keep the food refrigerate or heat or whatever you're gonna do to the food, right?

512
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:53,470
Scott: It's like old old planes Couldn't really have a big fancy kitchen on.

513
00:40:54,592 --> 00:40:56,398
Scott: We didn't invent that till you know.

514
00:40:56,459 --> 00:40:59,470
Rym: later or even if we did one that's expensive.

515
00:40:59,652 --> 00:41:03,078
Rym: If you have a kitchen like a real kitchen one How long is it gonna take to cook food in it?

516
00:41:03,339 --> 00:41:05,150
Rym: and two that's a bunch of seats?

517
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:09,378
Rym: You're not selling because you're taking How many people are on the plane in mind.

518
00:41:09,438 --> 00:41:13,090
Rym: you want to be a chef cooking with fire and then there's turbulence.

519
00:41:13,451 --> 00:41:15,358
Scott: So right we invented the microwave.

520
00:41:15,398 --> 00:41:18,048
Scott: at some point, you know, the airplanes are older than microwave ovens.

521
00:41:18,068 --> 00:41:18,570
Scott: I'm pretty sure.

522
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:24,240
Rym: Ah Actually, so microwaves are really old Scott they can't hear they.

523
00:41:24,521 --> 00:41:32,943
Scott: yeah, let's see invention of microwave oven 76. yeah All right invention of airplane.

524
00:41:33,043 --> 00:41:40,005
Rym: Well invention of airplane versus If I first commercial spoke mass market transcontinental flight.

525
00:41:40,025 --> 00:41:41,970
Scott: first commercial air flight was in 1914.

526
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:45,463
Rym: yeah, well that was a that was a different world.

527
00:41:45,483 --> 00:41:47,430
Rym: That was very rich people, but I mean dangerous.

528
00:41:47,731 --> 00:41:53,988
Scott: But if you're putting the microwave in the 70s, there were definitely people just flying in the 50s, right?

529
00:41:54,048 --> 00:41:59,950
Rym: or you know And I don't know what airplane food was like in that era, but I imagine it was not exist.

530
00:42:00,071 --> 00:42:06,568
Scott: I mean even if you think about like, you know Casablanca that movie came out in the 40s and it was just portraying normal people flying.

531
00:42:06,688 --> 00:42:11,359
Scott: Yeah, so So at least 30 normal very rich people.

532
00:42:11,901 --> 00:42:17,820
Scott: Yes, but that's still like 30 years between planes and microwave Flights couldn't be that long because he had to refuel.

533
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:25,626
Rym: a lot of long flights would stop a bunch of times along the way to Refuel get more food passenger or passengers would get out and eat the plane would refuel they get back out.

534
00:42:25,647 --> 00:42:27,573
Rym: It would take off again Exactly.

535
00:42:27,594 --> 00:42:30,766
Rym: Yeah, but in the in the modern era like in our era 80s 90s onward.

536
00:42:32,372 --> 00:42:34,480
Rym: It was basically just awful food until recently.

537
00:42:34,821 --> 00:42:44,810
Rym: So for most of my life until I'd say the 2010s My rule was never fucking eat on a plane ever.

538
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:49,169
Rym: It's not worth it eat before you close to eat after you fly never eat on the plane.

539
00:42:49,872 --> 00:42:51,939
Scott: Well, I think just due to circumstance, right?

540
00:42:52,160 --> 00:43:08,670
Scott: I didn't have too much experience with food on planes because Almost I think almost all the flights that I took in the last millennium the previous millennium Were short enough that there wasn't really like you weren't missing a meal on the flight to Florida, right?

541
00:43:08,931 --> 00:43:11,198
Scott: It's like you and they would maybe bring a snack.

542
00:43:11,258 --> 00:43:17,775
Scott: you would just get something that was you know, a shelf-stable cookie pretzel Right a water.

543
00:43:17,856 --> 00:43:21,770
Rym: Let's remember the TSA until September 11th didn't exist.

544
00:43:22,292 --> 00:43:27,087
Rym: So like when I flew in high school, you could just bring food and drink and anything you wanted on the plane.

545
00:43:27,128 --> 00:43:33,927
Scott: No one cared Yep, and I think the first time I ate airline food was on my foot Israel, right?

546
00:43:33,947 --> 00:43:43,164
Scott: So in the year 2000 Yeah, so this millennium and I don't remember what the food on the plane that was not a concern And it was really long.

547
00:43:43,325 --> 00:43:43,910
Scott: So it was.

548
00:43:46,251 --> 00:43:49,990
Rym: The microwave was invented for food production in 1946.

549
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:51,075
Rym: I don't know where you got.

550
00:43:51,115 --> 00:43:52,741
Scott: was it on airplanes in 19?

551
00:43:52,741 --> 00:43:53,585
Scott: was it something you could?

552
00:43:53,645 --> 00:43:56,364
Rym: I think it might have been too big to Put on an airplane at that time.

553
00:43:56,404 --> 00:44:03,330
Rym: Yeah anyway Uh Yeah, go to Israel first long flight.

554
00:44:04,052 --> 00:44:05,070
Scott: Yeah, I mean that was it.

555
00:44:05,312 --> 00:44:07,790
Scott: That was the first time I had food on an airplane and I don't remember it.

556
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:19,290
Rym: I think the longest flight I went on before I had a job that made me fly a lot or when Scott and I started Going to Pax's was going to Florida for band stuff as a kid But I didn't fly a ton.

557
00:44:19,511 --> 00:44:29,581
Rym: So flying was always such a special thing that like packing your own lunch or like eating big meal and then going to the airport Just always made sense like until my adult life flight.

558
00:44:29,641 --> 00:44:31,687
Rym: I wasn't like I was flying all the time.

559
00:44:31,947 --> 00:44:32,830
Rym: Like I couldn't afford that.

560
00:44:34,591 --> 00:44:41,058
Rym: So I sort of there was the era where Scott and I would fly a lot to Pax's like going out to Pax West every year became a thing.

561
00:44:41,078 --> 00:44:48,930
Rym: and are we specifically would always fly JetBlue because it used to be good and Their deal was they wouldn't have a meal on the plane.

562
00:44:48,970 --> 00:44:54,910
Rym: You could optionally pay for one, but it was added that yeah added that eventually and it was a simple meal.

563
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:58,990
Scott: It was basically this the meals that you could buy are basically adult lunchables.

564
00:44:59,050 --> 00:45:17,230
Scott: Yeah, it's like things like crackers cut up fruits cheeses a chocolate and some grapes Maybe maybe a sandwich that was pre-prepared and refrigerated Things along those lines that you know, really, you know now there wasn't any cooking involved.

565
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:20,909
Scott: It wasn't like someone fried an egg for you or anything of that nature, right?

566
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:22,494
Rym: But that that era.

567
00:45:22,915 --> 00:45:28,150
Rym: what we did and it became a thing is because JetBlue had a good terminal at our airport in JFK.

568
00:45:29,074 --> 00:45:36,310
Rym: they had actually Wall overpriced pretty good restaurants in that terminal like above and beyond the phone.

569
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:37,957
Scott: That was after they built the new terminal.

570
00:45:37,997 --> 00:45:40,307
Scott: There was the older terminal true true.

571
00:45:40,367 --> 00:45:41,110
Scott: That was not as good.

572
00:45:41,231 --> 00:45:42,038
Rym: It was not as good

573
00:45:42,401 --> 00:46:00,483
Scott: but it was the thing with Okay, so the thing with terminal food right is that the first thing you have to realize is that at least in the United States Right, which restaurants get to be in the terminals is not determined by how good their food is or anything of that nature.

574
00:46:00,544 --> 00:46:08,269
Scott: right because Airports are like such a bureaucratic thing with the FAA and all sorts of other business going on.

575
00:46:09,152 --> 00:46:15,687
Scott: The person who gets to put a restaurant there is the person who is good At dealing with that bureaucracy.

576
00:46:15,788 --> 00:46:28,264
Scott: Yeah So a lot of it is like these food service companies that specialize in knowing how to get their restaurants in airports, right and Those aren't necessarily the ones with the best food.

577
00:46:28,304 --> 00:46:31,757
Scott: A lot of them are very Cafeteria style, right?

578
00:46:31,838 --> 00:46:35,670
Rym: I mean the ones that are already are like the bad Delta terminal at JFK.

579
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:39,523
Rym: That's often like that separate building like it's just frozen.

580
00:46:39,543 --> 00:46:41,530
Rym: It's basically the same as airplane food, right?

581
00:46:41,973 --> 00:46:48,370
Scott: They want to give they want to put in, you know They don't care about how good the food is because there isn't really competition in there, right?

582
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:49,797
Scott: They have this captive audience.

583
00:46:50,199 --> 00:46:52,230
Scott: you are in the terminal, right?

584
00:46:52,631 --> 00:46:56,506
Scott: If you are making like a transfer and you're in that terminal you're gonna have.

585
00:46:56,647 --> 00:47:00,810
Scott: if you want food Unless you got your own food, you're gonna be eating at one of those places.

586
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:05,913
Rym: You don't have time to leave and come back and because of the TSA you couldn't bring your own lunch Right.

587
00:47:05,973 --> 00:47:08,490
Scott: So as a captive audience, you're gonna buy one of these foods.

588
00:47:08,851 --> 00:47:15,578
Scott: So we're gonna charge you as much as we can for the cheapest food that we can and Just do what we have to do to get away with that.

589
00:47:15,658 --> 00:47:21,670
Scott: Yeah now, you know you could if you're like smart You know eat and then go to the airport, right?

590
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:28,320
Scott: The problem is is that even if we got rid of TSA and everything There would still be like this waiting that happens.

591
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:30,347
Scott: Like you're not showing up five minutes before your flight.

592
00:47:30,408 --> 00:47:31,431
Scott: That's not happening Right.

593
00:47:31,692 --> 00:47:40,643
Scott: So even if you ate in advance, it's like there might be like this time period where it's like, you know You know some people I think a lot of people.

594
00:47:40,663 --> 00:47:46,389
Scott: it's like you're gonna want to eat something Before you get on the plane at least a snack right and they can get you at the snack bar.

595
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:51,630
Rym: Yeah, cuz the snacks in the airport are crazy expensive and also bad and limited, right?

596
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:54,350
Scott: It's like ah, even even if you want to buy something totally safe, right?

597
00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:58,386
Scott: It's like ah, you want to buy a bag of peanut M&M that normally costs at most a dollar.

598
00:47:58,406 --> 00:47:59,510
Scott: a dollar 25.

599
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:01,579
Scott: They're like seven bucks, right?

600
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:04,170
Scott: You talk about movie theaters captive audience, right?

601
00:48:04,290 --> 00:48:06,830
Scott: It's like this is worse than that and the selection so limited.

602
00:48:06,971 --> 00:48:09,608
Rym: I remember I was in Chicago for some reason.

603
00:48:10,774 --> 00:48:11,438
Rym: Me and Emily were though.

604
00:48:11,458 --> 00:48:12,121
Rym: Yeah, I was for a wedding.

605
00:48:12,141 --> 00:48:12,965
Rym: So we're in Chicago hair.

606
00:48:13,146 --> 00:48:15,176
Rym: Yeah, we're flying We need to.

607
00:48:15,196 --> 00:48:18,570
Rym: we want we want to drink something other than water like we like a beverage.

608
00:48:18,811 --> 00:48:24,052
Rym: We don't want something alcoholic and I canvassed the entire Terminal.

609
00:48:24,593 --> 00:48:27,340
Rym: there was no beverage I could buy.

610
00:48:27,681 --> 00:48:37,126
Rym: that was not an artificially sweetened like soda type thing A Sweetened tea with like high fructose corn syrup in it or alcohol.

611
00:48:37,467 --> 00:48:38,370
Rym: There was no juice.

612
00:48:38,731 --> 00:48:39,473
Rym: There was nothing.

613
00:48:39,493 --> 00:48:40,255
Rym: like.

614
00:48:40,496 --> 00:48:45,310
Rym: there was no unsweetened tea and usually an orange juice at least there was.

615
00:48:45,811 --> 00:48:46,654
Scott: That's that's of course.

616
00:48:46,674 --> 00:48:47,416
Scott: That's a bunch of sugar.

617
00:48:47,477 --> 00:48:51,650
Rym: But still yeah, it was like it was awful and there was nothing.

618
00:48:51,791 --> 00:48:54,542
Scott: So usually if you go to the place, there'll be a place that has coffee.

619
00:48:54,563 --> 00:48:59,789
Scott: You can usually get tea from them Hot water and throw it's a crappy teabag in it.

620
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:01,556
Rym: Yeah, but even they they didn't.

621
00:49:01,696 --> 00:49:05,590
Rym: they had like pod tea that had sugar in it already.

622
00:49:06,672 --> 00:49:07,117
Scott: Interest like.

623
00:49:07,157 --> 00:49:08,530
Rym: I was really mad about it.

624
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:10,882
Rym: I was mad about it for like a month because it's stuck in my.

625
00:49:10,943 --> 00:49:12,330
Scott: you were mad about it cuz you're hungry.

626
00:49:12,631 --> 00:49:18,810
Rym: I was hungry and thirsty and I'd already decided not to your hang because the food your hangar your hangar added to your.

627
00:49:19,895 --> 00:49:30,839
Rym: And that's really how they get you cuz even though you know The food's gonna suck at the airport like it's gonna be awful if you're in a hurry or you're already at the airport and you're hungry.

628
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:38,129
Rym: your options are go from hungry to hangry or Eat whatever slop at whatever price and just suck it up.

629
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:44,750
Scott: Now there's a second layer beyond the fact that you're trapped in the airport or on the airplane and there's no competition for food.

630
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:47,927
Scott: So if you're hungry your choices are be hungrier or pay.

631
00:49:47,947 --> 00:49:48,510
Scott: Yeah, right.

632
00:49:48,791 --> 00:50:03,953
Scott: The second layer is that because you are hungry right hunger is the best spice so That they can give you a lower quality food, right and you'll you you have this hunger spice that will Right.

633
00:50:04,173 --> 00:50:07,183
Scott: It's like they don't have to give you some fucking gourmet meal.

634
00:50:07,424 --> 00:50:17,150
Scott: right for you to think that it's you know Better than it is because you were so hungry that it ends up, you know sort of improving your opinion of the food.

635
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:22,667
Rym: But even then it hasn't elevated that opinion above like two out of ten on average.

636
00:50:23,269 --> 00:50:28,827
Scott: no Yeah, I think the saddest thing is like, you know when like?

637
00:50:28,847 --> 00:50:34,070
Scott: if you go It's like the airport in New York and you try to get like a bagel with cream cheese.

638
00:50:34,251 --> 00:50:41,550
Scott: It's like it's worse than like some bagel from the middle of the country or so It's like if they don't like why don't you have a New York bagel here?

639
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:51,282
Scott: it's like they just have the worst like steamed crappy bagel and like a lot of Charge you like seven dollars for it.

640
00:50:51,303 --> 00:50:52,910
Rym: A lot of airports now are even worse.

641
00:50:53,010 --> 00:51:00,190
Rym: They'll have a bunch of different restaurants, but they're actually just branding on the same shared industrial kitchen and the menu.

642
00:51:00,473 --> 00:51:01,383
Scott: That's all of them.

643
00:51:01,524 --> 00:51:07,550
Rym: Yeah, of course There's a few exceptions and most of those exceptions are international terminals in non-us countries, right?

644
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:13,225
Scott: I think the exceptions at least in the United States are actually surprisingly right.

645
00:51:13,747 --> 00:51:14,930
Scott: the fast food, right?

646
00:51:15,512 --> 00:51:26,048
Scott: It's in an airport like in New York on McDonald's in the airport is the same food as the McDonald's Airport if there's a McDonald's or a Shake Shack or a Wendy's or a Cinnabon or right?

647
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:29,259
Scott: It's like whatever kind of fast food is in there.

648
00:51:29,299 --> 00:51:32,070
Scott: If you got a Chipotle in the airport, I don't fucking know, right?

649
00:51:32,311 --> 00:51:40,183
Scott: it's like they're gonna be mostly the same as The ones that aren't in the airport and they're gonna have their own kitchen.

650
00:51:40,223 --> 00:51:46,589
Scott: that's separate from the other kitchens and their own employees Right and like those are usually a safer bet in the US.

651
00:51:46,709 --> 00:51:59,184
Rym: now I want you to internalize a sit-down restaurant or Scott Rubin of GeekNights has just said that there is a Scenario where fast food like that might be the better option and I agree with him.

652
00:51:59,485 --> 00:52:02,094
Scott: like 90% of the time I eat at a Shake Shack.

653
00:52:02,294 --> 00:52:03,197
Scott: It's the airport shake.

654
00:52:03,217 --> 00:52:03,458
Scott: Yep.

655
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:10,130
Rym: I have gotten a milkshake for breakfast at that Shake Shack at JFK on multiple occasions, right?

656
00:52:10,231 --> 00:52:11,620
Scott: It's like how often do I go to?

657
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,130
Scott: I can go to Shake Shack whatever the hell I want.

658
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:14,254
Scott: How often do I go?

659
00:52:14,837 --> 00:52:15,519
Scott: almost never?

660
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,110
Scott: Yeah, maybe once I can't remember.

661
00:52:18,612 --> 00:52:23,310
Scott: Maybe the last time I went to one was when I had a job and I was going in the office.

662
00:52:23,671 --> 00:52:24,594
Scott: I don't know.

663
00:52:25,115 --> 00:52:26,600
Scott: I was actually recently.

664
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:33,680
Scott: I was meeting some people from my previous job and There's a Shake Shack downstairs at Grand Central now.

665
00:52:34,222 --> 00:52:34,925
Rym: Oh, I didn't know that.

666
00:52:34,945 --> 00:52:35,427
Scott: so we went.

667
00:52:35,567 --> 00:52:36,933
Scott: we went down there Milkshakes.

668
00:52:37,013 --> 00:52:37,234
Scott: only.

669
00:52:37,374 --> 00:52:47,950
Rym: the last time I ate at a Shake Shack outside an airport was in March of 2019 before kovid because a co-worker wanted to eat there and I wanted to talk to him about non-work stuff.

670
00:52:48,231 --> 00:52:48,933
Rym: So I went with him.

671
00:52:49,957 --> 00:52:50,217
Scott: I went.

672
00:52:50,258 --> 00:52:51,542
Scott: you know, I can't believe.

673
00:52:51,582 --> 00:52:53,910
Scott: it's like I remember going when there was only one Shake Shack.

674
00:52:54,151 --> 00:52:55,557
Scott: It might have been square right and it was the.

675
00:52:55,798 --> 00:52:59,327
Scott: it was the only one and I would wait in line and eat there I would wait in line to.

676
00:52:59,571 --> 00:53:02,510
Rym: Mostly the milkshake was the reason I was waiting in line cuz the burger was okay.

677
00:53:02,590 --> 00:53:04,638
Rym: The burger is actually not the worst burger right.

678
00:53:04,678 --> 00:53:05,240
Scott: the fry was fries.

679
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:15,370
Rym: Okay, but now they're fucking everywhere Like it's so the other x-factor in an airport, but this is only a privileged option that I only have.

680
00:53:16,653 --> 00:53:18,549
Rym: Yeah, so here's the deal.

681
00:53:19,256 --> 00:53:30,109
Rym: If you don't flood one If you're not flying business class because of rewards from something or your company's paying for it You're probably fucking up because it is so expensive.

682
00:53:31,151 --> 00:53:31,352
Rym: What?

683
00:53:31,572 --> 00:53:38,732
Rym: why would you spend ten thousand dollars to have a slightly nicer six hours on a flight like Exactly.

684
00:53:38,952 --> 00:53:40,336
Scott: It's like, you know, it's like.

685
00:53:40,356 --> 00:53:45,350
Scott: yes is is it uncomfortable in the back of the plane and the in some coach cheapo seat?

686
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:46,613
Scott: Yes, but you know what.

687
00:53:46,955 --> 00:53:49,987
Scott: the plane goes at the same speed no matter what seat you're in.

688
00:53:50,007 --> 00:54:06,232
Rym: now I would say for super long flights Like if it was ten thousand dollars to fly to Australia business class considering our coach ticket was like four thousand dollars then $6,000 is still like like two Computers.

689
00:54:06,272 --> 00:54:09,720
Rym: Yeah, but that flight is not ten thousand dollars to Australia.

690
00:54:09,761 --> 00:54:13,730
Rym: that flight business class is like twenty five to thirty thousand dollars.

691
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:16,355
Scott: That's a car right?

692
00:54:16,576 --> 00:54:16,896
Scott: So it's like.

693
00:54:16,916 --> 00:54:21,830
Scott: would you rather have a car or would you rather be a little bit more comfortable?

694
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:24,738
Scott: For you know some number of hours.

695
00:54:24,839 --> 00:54:26,083
Scott: It's like you're it?

696
00:54:26,123 --> 00:54:27,990
Scott: the flight length is the same.

697
00:54:28,372 --> 00:54:35,609
Scott: So unless you are unseemingly wealthy It's like I will put up with basically whatever discomfort there is.

698
00:54:36,296 --> 00:54:37,368
Scott: Given the price difference.

699
00:54:37,389 --> 00:54:39,295
Rym: now I know the exception I'll make is I will.

700
00:54:39,416 --> 00:54:41,662
Scott: someone else is paying on an international flight.

701
00:54:41,983 --> 00:54:47,990
Rym: if I'm paying I'll almost always pay extra For that premium economy like in the middle because it depends on the price difference.

702
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:55,193
Rym: Yeah, you know sometimes like 5 to 2 X more and then business class is like 10 X more and then first guys is like 30x more.

703
00:54:55,213 --> 00:55:03,871
Scott: Yeah, if someone else is paying and they're not gonna just like give me like and they're not just give me the money Yeah instead and it's not like an option then Yeah I'll.

704
00:55:03,891 --> 00:55:05,795
Scott: it's like I'll take the airport lounge.

705
00:55:05,856 --> 00:55:10,307
Rym: food is a thing where if you it's one of those traps.

706
00:55:10,507 --> 00:55:23,709
Rym: where if you Experience it enough because like work lets you do it and like you only fly for work the next time you go to an airport and You can't go into that lounge because you're not gonna pay the ridiculous amount of money to have access to it.

707
00:55:24,272 --> 00:55:31,838
Rym: suddenly the airport feels so much shittier because the way those lounges work they just have Super good completely free food.

708
00:55:31,858 --> 00:55:51,010
Rym: You can like order meals in a lot of them and they'll just bring it to you and it's great unlimited alcohol unlimited drinks snacks waiters a shower, but the food is like legit good and I Do always eat in the lounge if I'm flying for work like on either end of my journey.

709
00:55:51,752 --> 00:55:56,790
Scott: Yeah, I mean why wouldn't you write that if you don't eat there that means that's whoever paid for it, right?

710
00:55:57,251 --> 00:55:59,117
Scott: I'll paid the $10,000 for the ticket.

711
00:55:59,578 --> 00:56:04,535
Scott: that in the included in that price is the shower and the food As like.

712
00:56:04,595 --> 00:56:08,450
Scott: if you don't take advantage of that, they're just keeping all that money.

713
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:18,730
Scott: Yeah, right and it's like even if you do take advantage of it They're still profiting right because the amount of they make so much money on the business tickets.

714
00:56:18,770 --> 00:56:21,460
Scott: That's where like the most of these revenues are right.

715
00:56:21,721 --> 00:56:26,839
Scott: because you think about the square footage of the plane Right the amount of dollars per square foot.

716
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:29,627
Scott: It's like it's all in the fanciest seats.

717
00:56:29,708 --> 00:56:30,390
Scott: Yeah, right.

718
00:56:30,633 --> 00:56:31,649
Scott: That's where all the money is.

719
00:56:31,710 --> 00:56:37,710
Rym: That's who's paying for the plane to actually if the airlines in the US could get away with just not having coach.

720
00:56:38,277 --> 00:56:39,049
Rym: They would try.

721
00:56:39,892 --> 00:56:42,710
Scott: They would yeah if they thought they could fill the plane also, right?

722
00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:47,066
Scott: Could you get that many people to pay the fancy price for that to fill the whole plane?

723
00:56:47,187 --> 00:56:47,970
Scott: Probably not, right?

724
00:56:48,011 --> 00:56:49,049
Scott: There aren't that many people.

725
00:56:49,916 --> 00:56:50,508
Scott: Who do that?

726
00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:53,521
Rym: So the secret is get the free upgrade or have a program like.

727
00:56:53,581 --> 00:56:55,589
Rym: I have enough points because all my work travel to her.

728
00:56:55,629 --> 00:56:57,729
Rym: now I just have access to the lounges.

729
00:56:57,850 --> 00:57:03,792
Scott: I always found it interesting that works like let employees keep all these points like if I was a work, you know It's like.

730
00:57:04,514 --> 00:57:10,990
Scott: obviously I want to be pro labor because I'm such a nice person, but it's like I'd be like Hey, we're paying for these flights with a company credit card.

731
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:16,890
Scott: Those points are on the company credit card and we're gonna use those points to get tickets for employees to fly.

732
00:57:17,192 --> 00:57:19,870
Scott: They don't belong to the employee to use for their own shit.

733
00:57:19,930 --> 00:57:20,512
Rym: So why?

734
00:57:20,552 --> 00:57:25,650
Scott: it's like I might use them on you if you're still my employee and for your next flight.

735
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:30,038
Rym: Look, I look into this a little bit cuz we talked about it a while ago And there's two factors that play a factor one.

736
00:57:30,058 --> 00:57:33,454
Scott: I'm not gonna use it for like your family to go on vacation I'll just pay you well enough.

737
00:57:33,514 --> 00:57:34,237
Scott: Well, you can do that.

738
00:57:34,538 --> 00:57:37,690
Rym: factor one the airlines don't let them do that.

739
00:57:38,112 --> 00:57:39,842
Rym: The points go to a human being.

740
00:57:39,862 --> 00:57:42,257
Rym: they don't go to a corporate account Fancy.

741
00:57:42,317 --> 00:57:45,534
Rym: okay, partly because the airlines They they.

742
00:57:45,554 --> 00:57:56,390
Rym: basically if an airline or a codeshare gets you business traveler to put your Business traveler loyalty program in when you fly for work, you're getting points on that airline.

743
00:57:56,450 --> 00:57:59,670
Rym: So when you fly for non-work, you're more likely to fly with that airline.

744
00:58:00,835 --> 00:58:02,250
Rym: Mm-hmm airlines profit.

745
00:58:02,551 --> 00:58:09,792
Rym: this is almost like advertising to wealthy people and like getting them to fly with you out of loyalty or Whatever.

746
00:58:09,813 --> 00:58:13,967
Scott: I mean I would be happy to out, you know, would I be happier to have?

747
00:58:13,987 --> 00:58:16,750
Scott: I mean I guess it's sort of be happy to have both right?

748
00:58:16,850 --> 00:58:22,148
Scott: It's like and a person who might change jobs to be loyal to my airline for their non-business travel.

749
00:58:22,188 --> 00:58:30,072
Scott: That's good Yeah But having a company be loyal to me for all of the travel of all of their employees that seems better Right.

750
00:58:30,533 --> 00:58:34,543
Rym: The other factor is that you know, I work in capital markets.

751
00:58:34,563 --> 00:58:40,538
Rym: I have spent kovat kind of messed it up a Terrifying amount of time flying all around the world.

752
00:58:40,578 --> 00:58:42,043
Rym: I've been to like 20 countries.

753
00:58:42,525 --> 00:58:43,086
Rym: I like.

754
00:58:43,227 --> 00:58:46,160
Rym: I've flown to London 40-ish times.

755
00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:49,497
Rym: I've flown to Singapore like 14 times.

756
00:58:49,537 --> 00:58:53,009
Rym: like I fly a lot and it's picking up again as kovat winds down.

757
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:59,830
Rym: and If I didn't get points for that and what and they weren't putting me in business class, I would absolutely just refuse.

758
00:59:00,271 --> 00:59:06,107
Rym: It's a perk because companies want employees to travel because it sadly does lead to business.

759
00:59:06,127 --> 00:59:07,090
Rym: that wouldn't otherwise happen.

760
00:59:07,672 --> 00:59:10,159
Rym: Like weirdly, I don't like that.

761
00:59:10,199 --> 00:59:16,941
Rym: That's the way it is, but I've seen it happen first hand for too long But - I just wouldn't like it dick without that perk.

762
00:59:17,563 --> 00:59:19,550
Rym: I would not travel for work at all.

763
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:26,530
Scott: Well, then it I mean if your employees are refusing to travel for business, you just have to give them more compensation.

764
00:59:26,791 --> 00:59:33,203
Rym: Yeah, I mean sure if they gave me another couple hundred thousand dollars a year Yeah, I might be willing to fly but how much?

765
00:59:33,424 --> 00:59:34,750
Scott: but but you'll do it for these points.

766
00:59:34,811 --> 00:59:36,450
Scott: How much are the points worth in money?

767
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:37,813
Rym: Oh, you know what the points are worth.

768
00:59:38,155 --> 00:59:42,170
Rym: I can fly Emily and I can fly business class for free when we go to Japan.

769
00:59:43,033 --> 00:59:44,379
Scott: Right, but how much does that cost?

770
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:45,846
Rym: fuck if I know the cares.

771
00:59:45,886 --> 00:59:46,670
Rym: all these systems work.

772
00:59:47,031 --> 00:59:56,620
Scott: It just what I'm saying is like if that if you know the cost of business class tickets to Japan is like, you know 30,000 $20,000 right a car?

773
00:59:57,021 --> 00:59:57,181
Scott: so?

774
00:59:57,302 --> 01:00:00,130
Scott: but you just asked for a hundred thousand in a compensation boost.

775
01:00:00,291 --> 01:00:02,784
Scott: So that does the math doesn't line up there.

776
01:00:02,824 --> 01:00:03,829
Rym: Yeah, I just want more.

777
01:00:06,290 --> 01:00:07,436
Rym: But you know what.

778
01:00:07,476 --> 01:00:13,501
Rym: remember how you'd always say like I always said all my flights were so cheap But it was because I had so many points that I had status on Delta.

779
01:00:13,802 --> 01:00:21,009
Rym: So like check bags were always free for me I didn't even know you had to pay for check bags because it was free because I only had to pay for it.

780
01:00:21,491 --> 01:00:26,230
Scott: Yeah, you know you'd had to pay for check bags for quite a while, but I have never had to pay for check bags.

781
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:28,995
Scott: The check bags is only.

782
01:00:29,035 --> 01:00:32,424
Scott: it is really just a consequence of the internet flight.

783
01:00:32,584 --> 01:00:32,865
Scott: Yeah.

784
01:00:32,905 --> 01:00:33,587
Rym: No, absolutely.

785
01:00:33,607 --> 01:00:35,632
Rym: That's a whole separate topic Wasn't?

786
01:00:35,713 --> 01:00:36,677
Scott: if it wasn't for that.

787
01:00:36,898 --> 01:00:38,466
Scott: That's the only reason they stopped including.

788
01:00:38,526 --> 01:00:39,210
Scott: it is because the internet.

789
01:00:39,330 --> 01:00:41,257
Rym: Yeah, but to get back to the airplane food.

790
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:43,004
Rym: What I can say is that there is all.

791
01:00:43,044 --> 01:00:48,908
Rym: there is a stark difference between The food on flights within a country like if we talk about America.

792
01:00:48,928 --> 01:00:58,269
Rym: Mm-hmm Even first-class on the fanciest airline that's flying between two cities in America We'll just have garbage food most of the time unless it's the second leg.

793
01:00:59,552 --> 01:01:01,702
Scott: Even have a food it's gonna be snack.

794
01:01:01,782 --> 01:01:08,969
Rym: Yeah, but even Flying coach like you booked the cheapest ticket on like Delta to London from New York.

795
01:01:09,913 --> 01:01:23,630
Rym: the coach food is actually pretty good like Surprisingly good and it's just part of the flight Because that's a long enough flight and the way then because of the time zone difference flying over the ocean You actually do kind of want a meal on a flight.

796
01:01:23,730 --> 01:01:32,197
Rym: And in fact, I would say eating the meals on long flights when the plane serves them will help you avoid jet lag Like and there's studies.

797
01:01:32,337 --> 01:01:34,770
Scott: You should definitely eat when they give you the food.

798
01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:39,249
Rym: Yeah, if it's a meal like that, they're like there's a practice go to sleep when they turn the lights off.

799
01:01:39,555 --> 01:01:41,074
Rym: Yeah the airlines don't worry about.

800
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:48,164
Scott: don't worry about where the Sun actually is right when you're on the plane if it's a long flight you Pretend that the lights on the plane are the Sun.

801
01:01:48,184 --> 01:01:52,759
Rym: Yeah, and you Like here's dinner eat it if you're not hungry.

802
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:59,130
Rym: if the flight attendants like dinners now for an hour and you're hungry Wait for that down wait that hour and eat then don't eat early.

803
01:02:00,004 --> 01:02:10,250
Scott: Yeah But yet I think the other thing is that you know It's just a part of the problem is that we live in the United States, which you know, the food here is not as good.

804
01:02:10,531 --> 01:02:12,040
Scott: That's a lot of other places.

805
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:20,489
Rym: I gotta tell you Turkish Airlines Holy shit, the food in premium economy on Turkish Airlines was better than like restaurants.

806
01:02:20,851 --> 01:02:23,430
Rym: I paid a lot of money for in New York to eat it, right?

807
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:28,669
Scott: It's like if you go to another country, right that actually has food with flavor in it.

808
01:02:29,053 --> 01:02:44,435
Rym: I'll tell you what I used to fly coach to India a lot because my other company wasn't as fancy in that regard and even booking like Air India or something in like the worst possible coach seat and like there isn't even a cushion on the seat Like I can feel the bar through it.

809
01:02:44,475 --> 01:02:45,118
Rym: It's just miserable.

810
01:02:45,138 --> 01:02:46,543
Rym: Oh the rice.

811
01:02:46,584 --> 01:02:50,308
Rym: Yeah, I could just it was bad But the food was great.

812
01:02:51,094 --> 01:02:53,450
Rym: That very aunty I ate on that plane was fantastic.

813
01:02:54,332 --> 01:02:58,150
Scott: Like if you fly to Japan, I'm sure you can get like some great sushi on that flight.

814
01:02:58,431 --> 01:03:03,430
Scott: Yeah, and if you fly to Florida, you can't get any sushi's not even a shitty convenience store one.

815
01:03:03,771 --> 01:03:12,159
Rym: I guess that the big secret I'd share is that flying internationally in my long experience doing this Coach foods pretty good.

816
01:03:12,521 --> 01:03:18,781
Rym: Generally when you're flying internationally Business class and up food is fancy restaurant food.

817
01:03:18,841 --> 01:03:24,363
Rym: It's literally like here's your five-course meal like But the sommelier brings you a wine bottle.

818
01:03:24,524 --> 01:03:25,770
Rym: It's like it's kind of nuts.

819
01:03:26,071 --> 01:03:40,228
Rym: It's fancier than I eat even in fancy times on my own Yep, but premium economy on those kinds of planes is like the magic sweet spot because you get like a more limited version Of the business class menu.

820
01:03:40,651 --> 01:03:41,754
Rym: You don't get the coach food.

821
01:03:42,035 --> 01:03:54,690
Rym: you get like the waiter and the metal knife and the for real food on most airlines In premium economy if you're traveling between countries or over an ocean Like it's good food.

822
01:03:55,951 --> 01:04:05,344
Rym: Yeah, I should post one of the menus like I. literally on my most recent flight back from Frankfurt I had a six course meal over the course of two hours on the flight.

823
01:04:05,965 --> 01:04:06,567
Rym: It was not.

824
01:04:06,587 --> 01:04:07,450
Rym: well that all.

825
01:04:07,490 --> 01:04:09,947
Scott: yeah That'll help you distract you from any discomfort you have.

826
01:04:10,047 --> 01:04:11,257
Rym: exactly I mean discomfort.

827
01:04:11,277 --> 01:04:12,084
Rym: it was business class.

828
01:04:12,124 --> 01:04:17,429
Rym: when I was tired I closed the door to my pod and laid flat in my actual bed that had a comforter.

829
01:04:17,991 --> 01:04:20,803
Scott: But I mean, that's still not as good as a bed a real bed.

830
01:04:20,864 --> 01:04:27,980
Scott: now still, you know It's just way way better than a seat with no leg a seat that leans back 1.5 degrees.

831
01:04:28,604 --> 01:04:31,096
Scott: Yeah, exactly It's all.

832
01:04:31,137 --> 01:04:32,350
Scott: it's all relative though, right?

833
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:32,591
Scott: It's like.

834
01:04:32,611 --> 01:04:45,390
Scott: that's what I'm saying is like, you know in the airport the captive audience the limited choice Right the hunger right the the all that right makes you judge everything in a completely different way.

835
01:04:45,470 --> 01:04:53,074
Rym: Lock me in a tube for 12 hours with no access to anything and then come to me with a McDonald's hamburger Six hours in.

836
01:04:53,415 --> 01:04:54,379
Rym: there is a decent chance.

837
01:04:54,419 --> 01:04:57,671
Rym: I'm gonna eat that thing and I'll be mad about it, but I'll eat it Right.

838
01:04:57,752 --> 01:05:05,994
Scott: and the fact that a lot of the price is either you know is often is either hidden or not hidden from you based On the circumstances, right?

839
01:05:06,375 --> 01:05:11,790
Scott: So, you know that five-course meal when you're in business class, you're like I just get this.

840
01:05:11,870 --> 01:05:16,708
Rym: It's like well, you know you paid $15,000 for this flight, right?

841
01:05:16,828 --> 01:05:23,530
Scott: It's like yeah It's like if you realize that that fat five-course meal that you're getting that's that's really good cost you $5,000.

842
01:05:23,530 --> 01:05:25,200
Scott: suddenly it doesn't taste so good.

843
01:05:26,990 --> 01:05:34,112
Scott: No You would never and even if you could have a restaurant on the ground that would serve you a meal twice as good you wouldn't $5,000.

844
01:05:34,112 --> 01:05:37,186
Rym: I mean you just did in New York City.

845
01:05:37,447 --> 01:05:42,803
Rym: if you spend $500 on a meal that is some of the best food you will ever have in your life.

846
01:05:42,844 --> 01:05:44,289
Rym: You can't get much better than that.

847
01:05:45,035 --> 01:05:45,925
Scott: Nope, not at all.

848
01:05:45,925 --> 01:05:51,892
Rym: $50 meal in New York City is some fucking amazing food Exactly.

849
01:05:51,952 --> 01:05:56,170
Scott: So it's like you don't realize that like on the one hand you're like, oh, it's amazing.

850
01:05:56,250 --> 01:06:00,363
Scott: It's like no when you remember that you spend much money on it.

851
01:06:00,383 --> 01:06:02,450
Scott: That's actually a terrible value.

852
01:06:02,714 --> 01:06:06,175
Scott: It's like the worst You might have.

853
01:06:06,195 --> 01:06:13,989
Scott: you might actually have better value back in coach Just shelling out the extra 20 when they come around to get the special meal.

854
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:18,507
Scott: Yeah value wise that might actually be better even though obviously doesn't taste as good.

855
01:06:18,527 --> 01:06:27,113
Scott: but $20 of like, you know some micro transaction to get an extra sandwich is better than $5,000 for a $500 meal.

856
01:06:27,234 --> 01:06:27,475
Scott: so yep.

857
01:06:31,312 --> 01:06:35,829

Rym: And like we talked about being angry If you're hungry, and it's been like a couple hours that you've been hungry I'm not even talking about starvation and like the horrors of existence if you're hungry and you remain hungry for four hours.

862
01:07:04,871 --> 01:07:19,270

Scott: at least you're very.

865

Scott: Yeah, you're like double.

867
01:07:29,177 --> 01:07:34,208
