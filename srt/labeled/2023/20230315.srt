1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,189
Rym: It's Wednesday, March 15th, 2023.

2
00:00:10,189 --> 00:00:10,510
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,260
Scott: And I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,865
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight.

5
00:00:16,146 --> 00:00:20,320
Rym: We're reviewing the new animated show Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur.

6
00:00:21,841 --> 00:00:24,120
Rym: You may know them from Marvel's Snap.

7
00:00:25,861 --> 00:00:26,878
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:28,881 --> 00:00:44,860
Rym: So uh, way back when Kickstarter like first came around, and even before Kickstarter, one thing that you and I were both into was having a really minimalist, thinnest possible wallet that wasn't like the traditional big ass leather George Costanza wallet.

9
00:00:46,240 --> 00:01:01,540
Scott: Yeah, I mean I still have a really tiny wallet, but my hope these days is that uh, they will, Apple, well New York will be one of the states that has, you know, the driver's license in your Apple wallet and then, cause literally the only two cards left in my wallet

10
00:01:01,741 --> 00:01:03,948
Rym: I do have to carry a MetroCard for one reason.

11
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:06,839
Rym: AirTrain, there's literally no other way to pay for it.

12
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:10,777
Scott: But if I want to go take the AirTrain, I would just buy one there, boop.

13
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:17,939
Rym: Uh, yeah, so uh, fun fact, when I was going to London for this work trip, uh, I took the AirTrain and I get there.

14
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:31,376
Rym: Every station, every machine that you could buy a MetroCard at, anywhere in that subway station at the end of the line where you get on the AirTrain, especially the ones that are near.

15
00:01:31,396 --> 00:01:36,512
Rym: the actual AirTrain entrance had like 10 to 15 people in line.

16
00:01:36,573 --> 00:01:44,300
Rym: It was like a mob you had to force your way through because nobody had MetroCards and nobody understood it and it was a gigantic shit show.

17
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:52,064
Rym: The only reason I was able to get through that massive crowd is cause I happened to have a MetroCard in my wallet that I didn't even know I had.

18
00:01:52,124 --> 00:01:54,372
Rym: that I found when I dug through my wallet.

19
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:58,077
Rym: It was like stuck between two credit cards and I happened to have some money on it.

20
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,534
Scott: Yeah, well, the AirTrain fare has increased to $825, right?

21
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,500
Rym: Which is a weird, non-round number that I hate even more.

22
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,993
Scott: Right, but let's say I'm about to go and use the AirTrain, right?

23
00:02:09,455 --> 00:02:14,360
Rym: Being a wise New Yorker Oh yeah, you go to a MetroCard other than the one in Jamaica, like obviously.

24
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:24,220
Scott: Right, I would just, while I'm about to get on the E, I would go pick up a 1650 MetroCard precisely So London, similarly, they got something like Omniknight.

25
00:02:24,281 --> 00:02:25,943
Rym: Then I would throw it out In London.

26
00:02:25,983 --> 00:02:29,500
Rym: now, you just swipe a credit card or an iWatch or whatever just like you do in New York.

27
00:02:29,962 --> 00:02:35,696
Rym: So I have a bunch of OysterCards with money on them, so I'm just using them every time I go to London until they run out of money.

28
00:02:36,546 --> 00:02:36,715
Scott: Yep.

29
00:02:38,061 --> 00:02:45,500
Rym: But, so anyway, I decided because I had, we had those plastic wallets that we bought that I think we reviewed on GeekNights and like made a big deal of that.

30
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,180
Scott: That was a super long time ago, the plastic wallets Yep, I still have one of those.

31
00:02:49,582 --> 00:02:53,580
Rym: I use it as my, I call it my stash wallet or my secondary wallet.

32
00:02:54,042 --> 00:02:58,660
Rym: All the cards that I need to keep but I don't need to carry every day are actually in that other wallet.

33
00:02:59,483 --> 00:03:01,100
Scott: No, I have them in a Ziploc bag, I don't know.

34
00:03:02,601 --> 00:03:06,760
Rym: But, well I kickstarted a wallet a long, long time ago that I've been using like this whole time.

35
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:13,218
Rym: I've been using this wallet for a long, long time and I really liked it, it was super minimalist Had that little carbon money clip on the end.

36
00:03:15,004 --> 00:03:15,895
Rym: I got a new credit card.

37
00:03:15,936 --> 00:03:20,360
Rym: recently I actually got a new card, like an Amex to get some rewards and all that biz.

38
00:03:21,082 --> 00:03:31,980
Rym: And I did a purge of my wallet and I discovered that I could reduce what was in my wallet by more than 50% And what I, but the prime, that was fine, that was great.

39
00:03:32,721 --> 00:03:41,660
Rym: The wallet I had kickstarted was so old and had slowly sagged and expanded because of the leather and time and my butt.

40
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,179
Scott: Yeah, the cards, cards fell out if you didn't put them up in there.

41
00:03:45,185 --> 00:03:51,940
Rym: I took all the cards out of the wallet, I set the wallet on the table And a credit card just like popped out of the wallet and fell on the floor.

42
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:56,020
Rym: And I was like, that can't stand, that's going to be a big problem immediately.

43
00:03:57,562 --> 00:04:08,400
Rym: So I bought what I hope is the last wallet I ever own And I found a really, really good wallet that is made of metal And it's only designed to carry a very small number of cards.

44
00:04:08,685 --> 00:04:09,440
Scott: Doesn't even have a money clip.

45
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,180
Scott: There's a whole bunch of those.

46
00:04:11,788 --> 00:04:18,040
Rym: When we were early GeekNights at those plastic wallets There were two, there was like that plastic wallet and one other company making a plastic wallet.

47
00:04:18,281 --> 00:04:22,500
Scott: The small wallet was like a brand new, I mean I'm sure it wasn't brand new.

48
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,400
Scott: There had probably been some in the past because grandpa's all had money clips and whatever.

49
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:38,820
Scott: But it's like the small wallet that only held a few cards and not like 100 photos of your whole family And a plastic window for your license and a whole area, a billfold area.

50
00:04:40,086 --> 00:04:45,580
Scott: Every single wallet I had up until then was that style The old style that held every fucking thing in the universe.

51
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:50,320
Rym: I used to keep like five checks in my wallet just in case I needed a check.

52
00:04:51,021 --> 00:04:53,439
Scott: The small ones were just becoming a thing.

53
00:04:54,026 --> 00:04:57,874
Scott: We were ahead of the curve And now there's just hundreds of them, 10 to 1000 different choices.

54
00:04:59,261 --> 00:05:00,339
Scott: They're all pretty much the same.

55
00:05:00,641 --> 00:05:13,380
Scott: But I'm hoping that yes, the only two cards that are left in my wallet Even my insurance cards are in my phone now Are my driver's license, which New York could partner with Apple to get it in the Apple Wallet.

56
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,180
Scott: Oh they could But they haven't.

57
00:05:15,362 --> 00:05:17,319
Scott: And then I have a credit card in there.

58
00:05:17,682 --> 00:05:24,260
Scott: But that credit card is also in Apple Pay And I very, very, very, very, very rarely actually have to swipe the card.

59
00:05:26,983 --> 00:05:30,380
Rym: I actually don't even need to carry this wallet and I would be fine most days.

60
00:05:30,647 --> 00:05:37,340
Scott: Yeah The only other exception is FSA card Which I was able to add the FSA card to Apple Pay.

61
00:05:37,506 --> 00:05:43,360
Rym: Whoa I would never have believed that would actually work Because FSA cards are all weird on the back end.

62
00:05:43,481 --> 00:05:44,480
Scott: That's exactly right.

63
00:05:44,521 --> 00:05:45,600
Scott: So I added it to Apple Pay.

64
00:05:45,701 --> 00:05:47,740
Scott: It showed up in the Apple Wallet just fine.

65
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,498
Rym: That is amazing.

66
00:05:49,346 --> 00:05:51,220
Rym: Honestly I am astonished by that.

67
00:05:51,686 --> 00:05:53,400
Scott: I'm not done yet You're not letting me finish.

68
00:05:53,965 --> 00:05:55,498
Scott: I tried to go and actually use it.

69
00:05:55,701 --> 00:05:58,779
Rym: Okay Okay I'm less astonished.

70
00:05:59,783 --> 00:06:01,680
Scott: It showed up even the right picture.

71
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,560
Scott: The picture in Apple Pay matched.

72
00:06:03,662 --> 00:06:04,740
Scott: It looked like the card.

73
00:06:04,922 --> 00:06:05,912
Rym: I got so excited.

74
00:06:05,953 --> 00:06:06,579
Scott: I thought it worked.

75
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:09,399
Scott: There was no indication that it wasn't going to work.

76
00:06:09,804 --> 00:06:14,579
Scott: And then when I tried to use it It wanted like a PIN number And it's like it was fighting with me.

77
00:06:14,984 --> 00:06:16,139
Scott: And I was like what the fuck is this?

78
00:06:16,282 --> 00:06:17,220
Scott: Why isn't it just working?

79
00:06:17,868 --> 00:06:24,900
Scott: And I was like Now if I have to go buy an FSA thing I bring the actual card Which does not even have a chip in it.

80
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,610
Scott: You have to swipe it like it's 19 2000 something.

81
00:06:31,037 --> 00:06:34,499
Scott: So Nothing much I can do about that But I use that so rarely.

82
00:06:34,964 --> 00:06:36,400
Scott: It doesn't need to live in the wallet.

83
00:06:38,091 --> 00:06:39,500
Rym: So I did my research.

84
00:06:39,661 --> 00:06:48,380
Rym: I looked around and I found what I think Is the best possible wallet And I really hope This is the last wallet I ever Own in my life.

85
00:06:48,461 --> 00:06:49,199
Rym: It's made of metal.

86
00:06:49,321 --> 00:06:50,500
Rym: I think it'll last forever.

87
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,958
Rym: It's way thin It's way comfy.

88
00:06:53,445 --> 00:06:57,958
Rym: It's called the Vulkit And based on all my research I'm just going to say I think it's the best one.

89
00:06:58,983 --> 00:07:02,260
Rym: There were some that all Looked equivalent but they were way more expensive.

90
00:07:02,887 --> 00:07:11,799
Rym: And there were some that looked equivalent That were so cheap With brand names that I did not trust That were only sold on Amazon And didn't seem to have websites That I also did not trust.

91
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:16,498
Rym: This seems to be like the perfect storm of money And it's pretty good.

92
00:07:17,289 --> 00:07:17,458
Scott: Yeah.

93
00:07:19,461 --> 00:07:21,198
Rym: So also It's finally warm.

94
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:22,498
Rym: I biked home from work today.

95
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:24,359
Scott: How warm could it be?

96
00:07:24,725 --> 00:07:27,379
Scott: It's like 45 out It's 43, that's cold.

97
00:07:27,562 --> 00:07:29,659
Scott: Yeah, that's bike weather That's cold.

98
00:07:30,104 --> 00:07:42,640
Rym: That is, let's bike to Poughkeepsie Let's go, it's biking and hiking season That's, don't even go outside At 43 At Fahrenheit Which is Ah yes, Fahrenheit.

99
00:07:43,044 --> 00:07:45,379
Rym: So I got 6 degrees.

100
00:07:45,581 --> 00:07:58,275
Rym: I did get a bunch of European co-workers to come around On the whole Fahrenheit vs Celsius thing And with one exception One of my teams over in Germany They all agreed, they're like Oh, Fahrenheit actually makes more sense And they're like kinda into it.

101
00:07:58,336 --> 00:07:58,458
Rym: now.

102
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:08,940
Rym: Okay They like the argument of It's a scale from 0 to 100 And 100 is really hot and 0 is dangerously cold And it's the human scale of temperature.

103
00:08:09,001 --> 00:08:09,913
Rym: And they were kinda into that.

104
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:18,960
Rym: But anyway I got a little mini Geek bite of something I did not watch Which I think this is more.

105
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,480
Scott: How can you geek bite something you didn't watch?

106
00:08:20,582 --> 00:08:21,480
Scott: Isn't that just prejudice?

107
00:08:21,884 --> 00:08:23,599
Rym: I mean I did this once, long ago.

108
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:33,518
Rym: You might remember an anime that was popular For a few minutes called Attack on Titan That had a really great first season And then kinda just goes nowhere And isn't worth watching at all after that point.

109
00:08:35,225 --> 00:08:37,880
Rym: So there was an anime we were watching Way back, we watched one season of it.

110
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,940
Rym: We even reviewed it Made in Abyss.

111
00:08:40,923 --> 00:08:45,357
Rym: And the only things you need to know about Made in Abyss Are the person who made.

112
00:08:45,377 --> 00:08:49,380
Rym: the manga Is definitely A bad person who likes bad things.

113
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,240
Rym: I think I can elaborate on that.

114
00:08:52,361 --> 00:08:56,099
Rym: You can look at this thing And you will know exactly what I mean.

115
00:08:56,221 --> 00:08:57,360
Rym: This is bad stuff.

116
00:08:57,502 --> 00:08:58,919
Rym: This is definitely a bad person.

117
00:09:00,444 --> 00:09:01,699
Scott: It's a bunny drop scenario.

118
00:09:01,822 --> 00:09:08,720
Rym: Yup And the anime was Way less of that Than the manga.

119
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,859
Rym: Though if I had known what was in the manga Before I had watched the anime I don't think I would have even watched the anime.

120
00:09:14,981 --> 00:09:18,959
Rym: But we're here, we watched that first season And it was alright, not the worst.

121
00:09:19,665 --> 00:09:21,960
Rym: I was moderately intrigued by the usual Terrible secrets.

122
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,940
Scott: Not the worst, I think you liked it a lot more.

123
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:26,679
Scott: If we go back and listen to the episode You're probably like, oh this is great.

124
00:09:27,042 --> 00:09:31,919
Rym: Well, I'm pretty sure I actually did go back and listen to some of that episode Because I have.

125
00:09:32,282 --> 00:09:40,680
Rym: I put a bunch of our anime reviews on YouTube a long time ago Like a few years ago During COVID when I was bored And we were both really into it.

126
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:49,283
Rym: But we also both spent like 15 minutes Talking about how we think the creator is creepy And how the show Is like right on the line Of.

127
00:09:49,384 --> 00:09:52,859
Rym: maybe nobody should watch this And maybe we should just burn this creator's works.

128
00:09:53,404 --> 00:09:57,637
Scott: Well, maybe the listener will go back To that episode and verify For him is lying or not.

129
00:09:58,992 --> 00:09:59,620
Scott: I'm too lazy.

130
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,140
Rym: I was vaguely curious.

131
00:10:02,221 --> 00:10:06,260
Rym: Just like with Attack on Titan, I wanted to know what was in the basement And turns out the answer sucks.

132
00:10:07,243 --> 00:10:09,620
Rym: I kind of want to know What's at the bottom of the abyss.

133
00:10:10,185 --> 00:10:20,259
Rym: I am confident the answer sucks But the reason I'm warning all of you is If you had any intention Of watching the newer Season of this show.

134
00:10:21,363 --> 00:10:33,859
Rym: A friend of ours Said some words About what happens In part of this season And I looked at a wiki and confirmed Unless you are really into Underage anal glands.

135
00:10:34,525 --> 00:10:36,682
Rym: Do not watch Made in Abyss season 2.

136
00:10:36,682 --> 00:10:42,340
Rym: Just assume that it is Not to be seen That the show just was never made.

137
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:50,560
Scott: Just forget about it Alright, well those three words Have definitely turned me off From watching that show ever again.

138
00:10:50,641 --> 00:10:57,240
Rym: I read a couple paragraphs of a wiki And those were the least Disturbing three words in that paragraph.

139
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,150
Rym: I'm done Do not engage.

140
00:11:02,885 --> 00:11:05,100
Scott: So I guess the manga creeped into the anime even more.

141
00:11:05,141 --> 00:11:05,760
Scott: Is what you're saying.

142
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:07,620
Rym: I think that was inevitable.

143
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,473
Scott: It's not inevitable.

144
00:11:11,183 --> 00:11:12,640
Scott: You can do a full on rewrite.

145
00:11:12,781 --> 00:11:13,731
Scott: It's like back in the day.

146
00:11:13,792 --> 00:11:17,240
Scott: we used to complain That the anime versions of things were nothing like the manga.

147
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:20,080
Scott: It's like the anime is nothing Like Ghost in the Shell.

148
00:11:20,886 --> 00:11:26,399
Scott: The animated versions of things Were like huge divergences From the original source material.

149
00:11:26,944 --> 00:11:30,239
Rym: But sometimes, like with Trigun That is literally just better.

150
00:11:31,365 --> 00:11:32,360
Scott: That's another great example.

151
00:11:33,145 --> 00:11:35,200
Scott: But then, you got these cases.

152
00:11:35,341 --> 00:11:37,299
Scott: It seems like the past decade or so.

153
00:11:37,502 --> 00:11:42,500
Scott: It's like a lot of the animes Are very, very just literal Reproductions of the manga.

154
00:11:42,742 --> 00:11:46,660
Rym: And it's like, on the one hand You want a monster manga as an anime.

155
00:11:46,741 --> 00:11:50,920
Rym: Guess what, it is literally just monster Scene for scene, line for line, shot for shot.

156
00:11:51,264 --> 00:11:52,215
Rym: That sucks, doesn't it?

157
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,327
Scott: Right, it's like.

158
00:11:53,367 --> 00:11:58,580
Scott: on the one hand I have this purist Urge of like a nerd.

159
00:11:58,782 --> 00:12:02,240
Scott: It's like I see something like a Spiderman movie And they'll change something.

160
00:12:02,301 --> 00:12:09,120
Scott: It's like Spiderman has biological webs Instead of a device The web shooter device that he makes.

161
00:12:09,241 --> 00:12:16,160
Scott: And it's like, I'm mad about that But it's like, it doesn't need to be Frame for frame the exact same thing As a Spiderman comic.

162
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,359
Scott: Because then what's the purpose of even making it?

163
00:12:19,842 --> 00:12:21,100
Scott: I've already read that.

164
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:22,920
Scott: Why would I read it again?

165
00:12:23,462 --> 00:12:34,614
Rym: There is a window that's not explored here And that window is what a few of those High budget But brief anime OAVs Would do in the 90s and early 2000s.

166
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:35,541
Rym: Where?

167
00:12:36,928 --> 00:12:43,339
Rym: what if you just faithfully recreate Some scenes from a manga But you animate the ever living fuck out of them?

168
00:12:44,031 --> 00:12:46,519
Rym: You can do that And that's fine, I'm down with that.

169
00:12:46,944 --> 00:12:58,440
Scott: The other thing you can do is If you really care about Purism and sticking to the canon Don't make your adaptation a retelling.

170
00:12:59,027 --> 00:13:05,795
Scott: Make your adaptation An additional story In the same universe With the same characters.

171
00:13:05,856 --> 00:13:07,148
Scott: possibly It's almost like.

172
00:13:09,967 --> 00:13:14,318
Scott: Obviously you wouldn't want to make it A sequel to the manga Because the people who haven't read the manga Can't watch it.

173
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:24,860
Scott: But you can definitely make A side deal Or something that would still be Entriable For people who haven't read it.

174
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,657
Rym: We've talked about it on GeekNights a lot.

175
00:13:29,121 --> 00:13:38,520
Rym: Sometimes if the source material Is S tier Then remakes of it Are just going to be a Degraded form of it in some way.

176
00:13:38,621 --> 00:13:44,740
Rym: Like Monster, no matter how good it is That manga is just like A work of art to be treasured by humanity.

177
00:13:46,128 --> 00:13:51,080
Rym: And that's not it But something that's not actually That good, like say the Trigun manga.

178
00:13:52,044 --> 00:13:56,218
Rym: The perfect storm Is when you take the good parts out of it And you just rewrite the rest.

179
00:13:57,685 --> 00:14:14,720
Scott: Well the other thing is that You can sometimes Even if you don't really change Too much from the source material You can enhance If your medium The way you tell the story In the different medium is transformative enough That it can be worthwhile.

180
00:14:14,926 --> 00:14:21,220
Scott: For example You have Initial D the manga But Initial D the anime Is basically the same fucking thing.

181
00:14:21,281 --> 00:14:22,986
Scott: It's really close Except Eurobeat.

182
00:14:24,961 --> 00:14:28,458
Scott: It's like you added some value With that Eurobeat in there.

183
00:14:29,181 --> 00:14:36,179
Scott: That actually then Feeds and enhances It's existence enhances the manga Because now someone goes to read the manga.

184
00:14:37,023 --> 00:14:39,532
Scott: Eurobeat plays If you just read the manga.

185
00:14:39,572 --> 00:14:48,860
Scott: before the anime existed No Eurobeat would play When you read the manga But now you open up to any page And music plays.

186
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:55,671
Rym: So The moral of this is Do not watch any more Made in Abyss However much you watch.

187
00:14:55,711 --> 00:14:57,532
Rym: just declare bankruptcy On that and move on.

188
00:14:59,088 --> 00:14:59,618
Rym: Got any news?

189
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:11,032
Scott: Yeah so The NHL and Disney Did a thing right because Hockey is on ESPN now And it was a really New thing.

190
00:15:11,072 --> 00:15:11,900
Scott: it happened yesterday.

191
00:15:12,505 --> 00:15:17,840
Scott: I was at in person at Madison Square Garden At the actual hockey game.

192
00:15:18,383 --> 00:15:21,045
Scott: That was the one that went with this Thing.

193
00:15:21,085 --> 00:15:27,130
Scott: so what they did is apparently There's some kids cartoon on Disney Something called Big City Greens.

194
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,300
Scott: I never heard of this show before.

195
00:15:28,421 --> 00:15:30,339
Scott: If it wasn't for this I still wouldn't know about the show.

196
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,100
Scott: I don't know about the show.

197
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:33,950
Scott: It's a kids show Kids cartoon.

198
00:15:34,273 --> 00:15:34,960
Scott: it exists right.

199
00:15:35,888 --> 00:15:47,200
Scott: And what they did Is for this one NHL game that was on ESPN Right yesterday March 14th They took The tracking data.

200
00:15:47,341 --> 00:15:54,840
Scott: There's already tracking data for basically Every NHL game in the players Equipment and in The puck right.

201
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:57,298
Scott: They just have it already.

202
00:15:57,359 --> 00:16:00,006
Scott: so They didn't add anything new To that.

203
00:16:00,591 --> 00:16:14,084
Scott: but what they did is they Collected that data in real time something They were already doing for every game And they fed it into Basically a video game Effectively speaking As the controller inputs Right.

204
00:16:14,104 --> 00:16:18,104
Scott: so each player by playing Hockey without even thinking about This.

205
00:16:18,165 --> 00:16:22,265
Scott: other thing that was happening Right was unknowing To them.

206
00:16:22,285 --> 00:16:26,188
Scott: I guess they might have known About it but that's not like they were thinking about it While they were playing.

207
00:16:26,209 --> 00:16:27,080
Scott: they were just playing hockey.

208
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:41,440
Scott: But Their body movements and the Location of the puck were the Inputs into a video game And in the video game There were basically Representations of many of the players.

209
00:16:41,863 --> 00:16:46,752
Scott: Some of the players the goalies and a couple others Were replaced by characters From the cartoon show.

210
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:48,006
Scott: I don't know who got Replaced.

211
00:16:48,047 --> 00:16:48,819
Scott: besides the goalies.

212
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:50,974
Rym: I don't actually know anything about the show.

213
00:16:51,054 --> 00:16:51,819
Rym: Big City Greens.

214
00:16:52,062 --> 00:16:53,200
Scott: I mean I said that already.

215
00:16:54,804 --> 00:17:05,175
Scott: They had different Commentators so Kevin Weeks and Someone else I think were commentating This video game As opposed to commentating on the Actual game.

216
00:17:05,318 --> 00:17:05,500
Scott: there was.

217
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:10,367
Scott: There was a normal broadcast of the game on ESPN Also right but on Disney Disney XD.

218
00:17:10,388 --> 00:17:12,958
Scott: I think you could watch On ESPN Plus also.

219
00:17:13,525 --> 00:17:23,685
Scott: They basically had an alternate Broadcast of the game where instead of Watching video footage of the game You were watching this video game To which the inputs were the real Players.

220
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:28,958
Scott: so the game played out The same way as it played in real life Except for the referee.

221
00:17:28,998 --> 00:17:38,780
Scott: that was Also a chicken that Would disappear and reappear To do puck puck drops and disappear Again and Could only say buck buck buck buck.

222
00:17:39,144 --> 00:17:40,500
Scott: And it was pretty cute chicken.

223
00:17:40,803 --> 00:17:42,136
Rym: It was overall pretty cool.

224
00:17:42,197 --> 00:17:44,760
Rym: I love This idea of telemetry driven visualization.

225
00:17:45,387 --> 00:17:50,600
Scott: Yeah so the graphics Of it were you know you look At it and you're like wow that's not great right.

226
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,825
Scott: And there was even a big goal where like the Puck teleported and teleported Right.

227
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:57,111
Scott: it was like everyone's making jokes like that's Offsides.

228
00:17:57,152 --> 00:18:05,065
Scott: maybe Right you know but You know for as much as people were Like ah this is stupid right whatever I think.

229
00:18:05,247 --> 00:18:11,898
Scott: actually the Response to this not just from You know there were those kind of fans who were like Ah this is dumb it's not funny.

230
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:24,899
Rym: The article I found all the comments You know the part of the internet you should never look at On a website are old men who were like If the NHL wants to grow the game They shouldn't do this technological mumbo Jumbo kids are distracted with their phones.

231
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:26,663
Scott: Right it's like You know.

232
00:18:26,744 --> 00:18:27,653
Scott: am I gonna watch this?

233
00:18:28,158 --> 00:18:29,553
Scott: No Right why would I watch this?

234
00:18:29,573 --> 00:18:31,378
Rym: I watched a few minutes Of it just to see if it worked.

235
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,432
Scott: Yeah but the point is is that Was it successful?

236
00:18:35,654 --> 00:18:50,020
Scott: I don't have the numbers So I can't say how to what degree It was successful but anecdotally There were people Who said that their kids Were into it and Wanted to watch the whole thing And those kids would not sit.

237
00:18:50,524 --> 00:18:54,440
Scott: Their kids were not you know watching Regular hockey games right.

238
00:18:54,865 --> 00:18:55,594
Scott: So that's a positive.

239
00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:05,918
Scott: And secondly Secondly the hockey people Right in the you know like Even though you know in advance They might have been grumbly grumbly.

240
00:19:06,907 --> 00:19:13,959
Scott: In the social media Among hockey fans A lot of people were posting Clips from this game.

241
00:19:14,626 --> 00:19:17,917
Scott: Right the video game version Like everyone wanted to see.

242
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:19,299
Scott: like oh What did that goal look like?

243
00:19:20,445 --> 00:19:20,789
Scott: They're like.

244
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:32,040
Scott: you know I was at the game and there was actually a great play Where You know Igor the goalie Had an assist right with a big long pass And so everyone was like.

245
00:19:32,888 --> 00:19:36,060
Scott: I think there was a character called Granny Or something that was taking the place of Igor.

246
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:43,679
Rym: I might have caused A minor disturbance In our Blaze in the Dark game because I had the game on On the other monitor and that happened.

247
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:48,520
Scott: Yeah I forgot to view myself But everyone was like oh Granny with the huge assist.

248
00:19:48,865 --> 00:19:55,500
Scott: Oh right it's like This was you know in its really Somewhat you know shabby Implementation.

249
00:19:57,546 --> 00:19:59,573
Scott: Pretty good Right you know.

250
00:19:59,674 --> 00:20:03,398
Scott: it made a bigger Splash than anticipated at least Within hockey circle.

251
00:20:03,844 --> 00:20:07,620
Scott: Cool thing to do And this was only the first one.

252
00:20:07,882 --> 00:20:09,659
Rym: This was like baby's first MVP.

253
00:20:11,089 --> 00:20:12,140
Scott: You give this shit.

254
00:20:12,321 --> 00:20:20,974
Scott: A few years and like this is gonna be Some hot stuff Right And I think it'll be pretty exciting Actually.

255
00:20:20,995 --> 00:20:28,382
Rym: so It's interesting because I remember way back when I was a kid We went to some like Red Wings Fan access event Cause.

256
00:20:28,402 --> 00:20:29,189
Rym: you know my family.

257
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:33,859
Rym: we were like really into hockey My mom and brother even way more than me And you're hitting autographs and stuff.

258
00:20:34,144 --> 00:20:48,460
Rym: And they had a little exhibit Where you would sit there you put on headphones And you would hear A hockey game commentary like an old hockey game And you would have to draw In a series of little like storyboards What the fuck happened in these plays.

259
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:56,020
Rym: And then You would see the video of what was Actually being commented on to see how accurate You were based on hearing the commentary.

260
00:20:56,444 --> 00:21:04,320
Rym: And the thing that always struck me about hockey Was that The only thing that a lot of people would get wrong Is they'd have like the left side or the right side wrong.

261
00:21:05,026 --> 00:21:07,378
Rym: But in terms of how the play evolved You can.

262
00:21:07,884 --> 00:21:11,536
Rym: You know a lot about what's going on Just from that very simple commentary.

263
00:21:11,576 --> 00:21:14,679
Rym: that's leaving A lot of information out At least on a broad level.

264
00:21:15,082 --> 00:21:20,059
Rym: I bet you could even train an AI model to listen to commentary And animate a hockey game pretty well.

265
00:21:21,307 --> 00:21:22,000
Scott: I think that you know.

266
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:30,245
Scott: The final form of this Really is just full VR sports right where a person Isn't on ice they're not wearing Skates.

267
00:21:30,306 --> 00:21:31,317
Scott: they're not right.

268
00:21:31,357 --> 00:21:39,660
Scott: it's like They're just somewhere where there's Enough tracking on their bod Right and they make the movements And they're wearing some kind of goggles.

269
00:21:39,761 --> 00:21:43,859
Scott: So it looks like hockey to them Right but they're really just playing a video game.

270
00:21:44,548 --> 00:21:50,160
Rym: There is already Installation level tennis where you have A person on each side of a full sized tennis court.

271
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:50,699
Scott: There's golf simulators.

272
00:21:51,003 --> 00:21:57,407
Rym: Yeah no you have people standing on the On either side of a full sized indoor tennis court Wearing VR helmets but not Consumer.

273
00:21:57,468 --> 00:22:09,092
Rym: this is like installation VR where it's using the room And like it's not technology we could get And you run at full speed And play for real tennis But you're in a virtual fucked up World.

274
00:22:10,405 --> 00:22:13,309
Scott: I don't see the Point of that though?

275
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:18,300
Rym: Well cause there's like pits don't fall In them and there's stuff happening and it's Oh okay it's not.

276
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:22,219
Rym: It's not just like You put on the VR helmet and everything looks the same.

277
00:22:23,344 --> 00:22:24,480
Scott: It's VR Mario Tennis.

278
00:22:24,521 --> 00:22:25,260
Scott: That's what you're saying.

279
00:22:27,523 --> 00:22:42,499
Rym: This also For sportspectation like imagine Just if you had a VR headset If you could buy a really cheap hockey Ticket and just watch the game like you're Sitting in the front row or sitting in any fucking Seat you want or you're in Igor Shostakin watching what he sees.

280
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:43,979
Scott: Right it's like they.

281
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:49,596
Scott: Instead of having to put cameras All over they just need to put enough Tracking yeah telemetry.

282
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:52,540
Scott: And then for the broadcast of the game.

283
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:53,469
Scott: It's like right now.

284
00:22:53,732 --> 00:23:04,680
Scott: you know if you're watching A live broadcast of a sporting event They can only put cameras You know in certain places right It's like they have to not block the views of the Spectators they have to not get in the way of the players.

285
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,819
Scott: They can only go where they're like mountable.

286
00:23:07,225 --> 00:23:08,340
Scott: Right it's like this limit.

287
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:22,924
Scott: You know how big is the camera that they're putting in different Places and you know you can't just Put cameras in you know but with if you Have if you're just recreating the Game exactly in a Digital world you can just put A camera in fucking anywhere because the camera is Virtual.

288
00:23:22,965 --> 00:23:27,066
Rym: yeah right and telemetry data Is cheap like if any of you are video gamers because This is Wednesday.

289
00:23:27,107 --> 00:23:28,280
Rym: we don't talk about this stuff that much.

290
00:23:28,764 --> 00:23:38,720
Rym: When you're playing an FPS with a bunch of other people The only data that's Going back and forth between these clients Is the telemetry data of where all the Objects are and how they're interacting.

291
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:43,558
Rym: Every end point is Rendering a view based on that Pure telemetry data.

292
00:23:44,843 --> 00:23:45,995
Scott: So yeah I think that this is.

293
00:23:46,056 --> 00:23:48,056
Scott: you know Most people don't have any idea.

294
00:23:48,097 --> 00:23:51,914
Scott: this even Happened but this is Like a first of its kind deal.

295
00:23:51,934 --> 00:23:54,035
Scott: it happened Yesterday while we were at the game.

296
00:23:54,075 --> 00:23:58,863
Scott: they were showing Some clips of it on the scoreboard In the arena after the Fact.

297
00:23:58,964 --> 00:23:59,530
Rym: but a good idea.

298
00:23:59,551 --> 00:24:04,844
Scott: this is Sort of like you know if you think about like Hatsune Miku version 1 and where it is Today.

299
00:24:05,087 --> 00:24:08,035
Scott: like this is gonna Evolve right along that.

300
00:24:08,075 --> 00:24:15,530
Rym: I think a lot Of people are distracted by all the AI, ML, GPT whatever nonsense Going on and people I think A lot of people aren't.

301
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:21,011
Rym: They're drastically underestimating What this is and what it's Going to be.

302
00:24:22,523 --> 00:24:24,559
Scott: I'm hopeful for this right especially you know.

303
00:24:24,826 --> 00:24:28,935
Scott: Yeah Maybe some kids out there are gonna Watch hockey.

304
00:24:28,976 --> 00:24:30,980
Rym: now We gotta get more people watching hockey.

305
00:24:32,104 --> 00:24:39,859
Rym: And last little news in case you were unaware You know Gkids the masters Of you wanna see some good animation In theaters in America.

306
00:24:40,944 --> 00:24:54,945
Rym: They're doing once again this year Like in March End of March, April, May, June, July A bunch of the Ghibli movies Including the live action Spirited Away play Are just gonna be in theaters all over America.

307
00:24:54,965 --> 00:24:56,117
Scott: well they do this.

308
00:24:56,197 --> 00:25:09,148
Scott: they do This every year but the play is the New one because the basically the live Action you know theatrical Spirited Away is gonna be performed In Japan and there will be a Live stream of it to Movie theaters.

309
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:14,499
Rym: you know in the US April 23rd and April 27th we can Just go see it at the start of Kauffman like right by us.

310
00:25:15,045 --> 00:25:19,552
Scott: Yeah I'm gonna probably go to the movie Theater nearby and you know watch It the same time.

311
00:25:19,592 --> 00:25:26,218
Scott: people in Japan Are in the theater seeing it right Which is uh People don't realize this.

312
00:25:26,278 --> 00:25:26,480
Scott: it's like.

313
00:25:26,601 --> 00:25:26,905
Scott: You know.

314
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:28,017
Scott: I went to the.

315
00:25:28,462 --> 00:25:31,320
Scott: I've known for a while that they do the Fathom events.

316
00:25:32,683 --> 00:25:41,712
Scott: Yeah basically one of the things that they do Also along similar lines is They'll show the Metropolitan Opera On the screen either live Or recorded.

317
00:25:41,733 --> 00:25:47,920
Scott: and It's like I went to the opera recently And that shit's expensive and a movie Ticket is way cheaper.

318
00:25:48,804 --> 00:25:52,360
Scott: And it's like they don't sell a lot of DVDs of that or put it on YouTube.

319
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,068
Scott: A lot right.

320
00:25:53,088 --> 00:25:57,673
Scott: so um It's you know maybe there's pirates out there I guess probably.

321
00:25:57,693 --> 00:26:04,400
Scott: but Um that's probably the least Expensive way to see It like value wise right.

322
00:26:04,864 --> 00:26:12,599
Scott: So if you don't have a world Class opera house where you live but you have A movie theater Maybe you should go to one of those.

323
00:26:12,822 --> 00:26:13,896
Scott: It would probably be worth it.

324
00:26:20,073 --> 00:26:22,884
Rym: But anyway things Of the day.

325
00:26:22,985 --> 00:26:35,370
Rym: so uh Do you ever wonder like On a modern ship like when we take the ferry Even uh over to uh Sandy Hook There's lifeboats you ever Wonder like how they work and what's in them And like what a modern boat looks like.

326
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:37,309
Scott: Harry doesn't have a big fancy lifeboat like this.

327
00:26:37,572 --> 00:26:38,137
Rym: Uh they have.

328
00:26:38,259 --> 00:26:40,480
Rym: they have some that are only A step down from this.

329
00:26:40,742 --> 00:26:43,247
Rym: they have the ones that Roll out from the side of the boat.

330
00:26:44,856 --> 00:26:45,509
Rym: I found this video.

331
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:48,426
Scott: A lot of things have the inflatable ones A little triangle in front yep.

332
00:26:49,072 --> 00:26:56,590
Rym: But uh imagine if you're on like a cruise ship in the middle of the Pacific And there's those gigantic Orange lifeboats the ones that are basically Just boats like.

333
00:26:57,774 --> 00:27:01,915
Rym: I realized when I found this video I didn't know anything about them like I Couldn't.

334
00:27:01,956 --> 00:27:05,596
Rym: even I didn't even know what they looked like Inside how they worked Nothing.

335
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:06,806
Rym: and this video.

336
00:27:06,846 --> 00:27:07,674
Scott: we've never been In one.

337
00:27:07,714 --> 00:27:08,866
Rym: why would you know why would you be?

338
00:27:08,926 --> 00:27:16,240
Scott: they're not gonna Let me unless you unless you had some boat training Or something right or I Guess to people when they go on cruises Never been on a cruise.

339
00:27:16,402 --> 00:27:17,190
Scott: they don't know they.

340
00:27:17,291 --> 00:27:24,749
Rym: They have a muster thing where all they do is make You stand where the lifeboats are gonna be And tell you that you might have to get into Them but they don't teach you anything about them.

341
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:41,509
Rym: Okay I learned this because During COVID When for some reason capitalism Cruises were still happening Cruises didn't have to do that muster Because that got too many people together in the same place At the same time and they relatively recently Had to start doing that again.

342
00:27:42,136 --> 00:27:45,105
Rym: And uh that's why I learned About this because that was in the news.

343
00:27:45,347 --> 00:27:48,630
Rym: and then I Found this video because I remembered like wait lifeboats The fuck's even in those?

344
00:27:48,932 --> 00:27:54,422
Scott: It seems like you know a cruise should do more Than like a flight but Oh you would think that.

345
00:27:54,543 --> 00:27:56,097
Rym: but uh no Cruises suck.

346
00:27:56,501 --> 00:27:58,116
Rym: uh you know My feelings.

347
00:27:58,177 --> 00:27:59,490
Rym: on cruises you have similar feelings.

348
00:27:59,672 --> 00:28:01,249
Scott: I'm not a fan of going on a cruise.

349
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:03,030
Scott: There are kinds of cruises that could be cool.

350
00:28:03,171 --> 00:28:09,550
Scott: I have thought about the buy a home On a cruise that goes around the world and you Spend three years of your life doing that and nothing else.

351
00:28:09,631 --> 00:28:16,650
Rym: I've also thought about just book a birth On a cargo ship and spend a month going Across the Pacific like kind of want to do that For real not even joking.

352
00:28:17,393 --> 00:28:18,666
Scott: I mean it depends on the.

353
00:28:18,787 --> 00:28:24,217
Scott: you know You might go into it with uh rose colored Glasses and then you know a week in you're like That's enough of that.

354
00:28:24,238 --> 00:28:26,910
Scott: they're like well you're stuck in this Uncomfortable ass boat with us now.

355
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:29,939
Rym: But worst case scenario one I know They're pretty comfortable.

356
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:45,969
Rym: I've watched a bunch of Documentaries on this and two Oh no I have to just play Video games and hang out with Emily and drink And eat food and like Okay this is way Better than my working life And it costs like six dollars A day alright.

357
00:28:47,537 --> 00:28:56,022
Rym: Anyway So this is a video that will tell you what the deal Is with modern Lifeboats and it's Way cooler than I thought.

358
00:28:56,043 --> 00:28:56,690
Rym: there's a lot going on.

359
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:58,507
Scott: There is a sponsor on this video.

360
00:28:58,527 --> 00:29:00,164
Scott: I Dislike the sponsor.

361
00:29:00,204 --> 00:29:02,306
Scott: you should not Patronize the sponsor of the video.

362
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:06,770
Rym: So the secret if you don't know This I assume Scott knows this.

363
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:08,022
Rym: A lot of internet people know it.

364
00:29:08,607 --> 00:29:11,478
Rym: ad block Can block between ad block and just Paying for YouTube.

365
00:29:11,498 --> 00:29:14,848
Rym: you don't see ads but That doesn't block the natural ad.

366
00:29:14,909 --> 00:29:23,361
Rym: read Where you're watching like a SciShow video And they pause for a second and then they're like Speaking of blah blah blah Brilliant something You know.

367
00:29:23,381 --> 00:29:24,998
Rym: the old timey ad read Can't?

368
00:29:25,058 --> 00:29:26,029
Rym: it's hard to block those.

369
00:29:26,756 --> 00:29:39,178
Rym: The way you block those on YouTube Is if you've noticed if you hover Over the timeline on a modern YouTube video You see the heat map of what Parts of the video people have watched more or watched Over and over again.

370
00:29:39,198 --> 00:29:42,209
Rym: and in any video With ad reads you'll see a huge hump.

371
00:29:42,734 --> 00:29:46,469
Rym: Occasionally that hump Is all the people trying to skip the ad read.

372
00:29:47,015 --> 00:29:54,520
Rym: So hover Over look for the hump Click on the end of the hump And you'll always be past the ad read Well you also.

373
00:29:54,540 --> 00:30:00,864
Scott: there's an extension I think With community submitted time Codes that will automatically skip The ads for you.

374
00:30:00,905 --> 00:30:07,450
Scott: but I just You know I just yeah Whenever an ad read starts I just click forward until it's gone.

375
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:13,727
Rym: But the hump is the way to find it Especially if you watch weird videos that no one Bothered to put time codes in for where the ad reads are.

376
00:30:14,874 --> 00:30:15,685
Rym: So anyway what do you got?

377
00:30:17,036 --> 00:30:21,578
Scott: So If you ever go see an old timey Silent film right You know.

378
00:30:21,598 --> 00:30:28,830
Scott: like if you Go on YouTube and look for a silent film It won't actually be Silent right?

379
00:30:29,072 --> 00:30:29,334
Scott: It's like.

380
00:30:29,354 --> 00:30:34,790
Scott: yeah there's gonna be like title cards for all the Dialogue if there is any And you won't hear anyone talking.

381
00:30:35,813 --> 00:30:41,049
Scott: But there's like a little old timey Music playing like do do do do do do Like on a piano probably right.

382
00:30:41,312 --> 00:30:47,810
Scott: Maybe a few sound effects that whistle Like if there's a car It'll go like honk honk or a ooga.

383
00:30:48,275 --> 00:30:52,114
Scott: Right it's like there's noises Going on even though it's a silent Film.

384
00:30:52,741 --> 00:30:54,196
Scott: where were those noises Coming from?

385
00:30:54,237 --> 00:31:04,581
Scott: well sometimes the noises Were coming from just people In the back right making noises Sometimes you know it depends on Where you saw the silent film and when and All kinds of things.

386
00:31:04,602 --> 00:31:05,128
Scott: but it's not like.

387
00:31:05,431 --> 00:31:12,660
Rym: It's not like they had a and they're just watching the movie With you and they're like they have a sheet that says Make the gunshot noise around this time And they watch the movie.

388
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,402
Rym: they kind of just like Bang on something.

389
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:14,929
Scott: yep.

390
00:31:15,391 --> 00:31:21,190
Scott: But there was apparently an instrument That I never knew about Until recently called the photo player.

391
00:31:21,432 --> 00:31:22,543
Scott: And what is a photo player?

392
00:31:22,664 --> 00:31:33,390
Scott: it's basically A non portable one man Band plus player piano in one Machine yep with a Very important addition Of the sound effects generators.

393
00:31:34,258 --> 00:31:34,460
Scott: Right.

394
00:31:34,501 --> 00:31:39,210
Scott: well so it's basically A player piano right With one additional modification.

395
00:31:39,614 --> 00:31:40,380
Scott: Is that you can?

396
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:41,712
Scott: you can get Like.

397
00:31:41,894 --> 00:31:43,569
Scott: you can get two rolls going on there.

398
00:31:43,913 --> 00:31:48,197
Scott: So you can seamlessly go from roll one To roll two to roll three without a gap Because you can.

399
00:31:48,338 --> 00:31:52,903
Scott: you can get that because the role Of player piano music is Shorter than the movie right.

400
00:31:52,923 --> 00:31:57,169
Scott: so you need to Be able to queue up rolls back and forth Between the two rollers right.

401
00:31:57,936 --> 00:32:01,490
Scott: And then it's got An organ in addition to a piano.

402
00:32:02,076 --> 00:32:03,065
Scott: So it's a it's a it's.

403
00:32:03,126 --> 00:32:07,788
Scott: you know you got This one keyboard going but you can play the organ Or the piano or kind of both right.

404
00:32:08,578 --> 00:32:10,602
Scott: So you get all kinds of more Noises going on there.

405
00:32:10,622 --> 00:32:17,510
Scott: you know The main feature of the organ that the piano doesn't Have is sort of the infinite sustain Which you kind of need for a lot of things.

406
00:32:19,042 --> 00:32:34,530
Scott: And then You got foot pedals and pull Levers and all sorts of things because next To the piano organ Is a box and in that box you got a Drum and a cowbell And horns and Toot flutes and chimes And all sorts of fucking

407
00:32:35,634 --> 00:32:37,290
Rym: That you hear in a lot of old cartoons.

408
00:32:38,036 --> 00:32:40,075
Scott: Yeah just all sorts of fucking things In there.

409
00:32:40,337 --> 00:32:48,197
Scott: right and the person operating Since the player piano role Is you know you could play the piano With your hands but the role is Taking care of that.

410
00:32:48,237 --> 00:32:55,310
Scott: you're using your hands To like change the organ settings You know and and pull the Things and honk the horns right.

411
00:32:55,654 --> 00:33:05,046
Scott: And as long as you know if you know the film Well which you're if it's your job to Operate this instrument then yeah Yeah you're gonna do this over and over again Like a hundred times for every night.

412
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:09,330
Scott: you probably You probably practice with the movie like once Or twice before you do it for real right?

413
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:10,765
Scott: It's like the scene where the horn comes in.

414
00:33:10,785 --> 00:33:12,461
Scott: you reach over And go honk honk right.

415
00:33:12,926 --> 00:33:16,988
Scott: if there's two Cars you use the second horn For car number two.

416
00:33:17,432 --> 00:33:23,210
Scott: It's like so there's this guy Joe Renato And on YouTube you will find.

417
00:33:23,311 --> 00:33:26,160
Scott: I'm just linking to one of the videos but you just Search for this guy.

418
00:33:26,685 --> 00:33:31,310

424
00:33:47,535 --> 00:33:50,543
Scott: Yeah but he's basically you know The photo player expert.

425
00:33:50,563 --> 00:33:55,269
Scott: dude there's tons Of videos on YouTube with this one guy Being the photo player guy.

Scott: you know He's there sharing all the information There is to know about this instrument Where it came from who made it Other versions of it how many are left How it works etc.

428
00:34:06,284 --> 00:34:06,365
Scott: etc.

429
00:34:08,315 --> 00:34:17,329
Scott: So if this one Video doesn't satisfy You can search for his name And you will be inundated With everything you need to know about this.

430
00:34:18,117 --> 00:34:32,380
Scott: And I think the moral here Is that there's a lot of you know White nerdy comic book guys out there Who are collecting various Things simply For the sake of You know collecting and materialism And etc.

431
00:34:32,402 --> 00:34:32,503
Scott: etc.

432
00:34:33,554 --> 00:34:36,706
Scott: Right whether it's baseball cards or board games Or comics or whatever.

433
00:34:36,786 --> 00:34:36,949
Scott: right.

434
00:34:37,655 --> 00:34:45,130
Scott: If you are going to collect something And you are not Actually a museum Right you're just a person.

435
00:34:45,735 --> 00:34:59,697
Scott: You should aspire To be like Joe Renato Right who has collected A photo player Right but really has collected Knowledge of the photo player And shared it and acted as A museum.

436
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:04,728
Scott: right if you just got A collection in your house it's like Uh I'm not a fan.

437
00:35:05,031 --> 00:35:06,989
Rym: Indiana Jones has some words for you.

438
00:35:07,575 --> 00:35:12,529
Scott: That's right but if you do It the Joe Renato way right Then I'm going to be a huge fan.

439
00:35:12,953 --> 00:35:14,667
Scott: Complete opposite right.

440
00:35:14,728 --> 00:35:25,190
Scott: so if You got a big ol' collection Of something right Start you know acting Like Joe Renato does with that collection And that would be totally awesome.

441
00:35:26,282 --> 00:35:31,680
Rym: In the meta moment The GeekNights Book Club book Is the satanic Versus.

442
00:35:32,004 --> 00:35:36,449
Rym: having read The first couple of chapters This is an S tier book.

443
00:35:36,915 --> 00:35:38,270
Rym: It is S tier literature.

444
00:35:39,075 --> 00:35:39,840
Rym: It is.

445
00:35:40,162 --> 00:35:41,289
Rym: there's a lot going on here.

446
00:35:43,371 --> 00:35:44,419
Scott: I haven't even read one word yet.

447
00:35:46,034 --> 00:35:48,528
Scott: Satan is not The latest fan upon me.

448
00:35:49,033 --> 00:35:52,210
Rym: Honestly read the first page Before you don't even bother.

449
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:54,069
Rym: Just read the first page and you'll see what I mean.

450
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:54,762
Scott: I got a lot of shit to do.

451
00:35:54,802 --> 00:35:55,149

Rym: next week.

454
00:36:00,051 --> 00:36:00,598
Scott: That's real soon.

455
00:36:01,711 --> 00:36:22,829
Rym: At 2.30pm eastern time in the Bumblebee Theater we will have a panel That very few people have seen And even the people Who have seen it saw an early Prototype version of it either at a Magfest where we did it once Or in the video that Magfest uploaded Or the patrons Saw an audio only version of it With the slides.

456
00:36:24,113 --> 00:36:26,624
Rym: I've already been planning a lot of changes to this Before next week.

457
00:36:27,272 --> 00:36:30,349
Rym: Can competitive and casual coexist?

458
00:36:30,975 --> 00:36:33,522
Rym: And the spoiler answer Is in the same game?

459
00:36:33,805 --> 00:36:37,346
Scott: Fuck no Absolutely not Probably not right.

460
00:36:37,386 --> 00:36:37,750
Scott: it's tough.

461
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:41,210
Rym: If you can make them coexist You will be a billionaire.

462
00:36:41,971 --> 00:36:43,424
Scott: Yeah it's one of those things where it's like.

463
00:36:43,464 --> 00:36:44,696
Scott: does P equal NP?

464
00:36:44,797 --> 00:36:45,242
Scott: and it's like?

465
00:36:45,282 --> 00:36:47,222
Scott: well you know I can't say for sure.

466
00:36:47,383 --> 00:36:49,664
Scott: otherwise I'd be Like a zillionaire right?

467
00:36:49,745 --> 00:36:54,569
Scott: I'll be famous Forever but we're pretty sure What the answer is right?

468
00:36:55,677 --> 00:36:56,146
Rym: Alright.

469
00:36:56,187 --> 00:36:57,810
Rym: so Marvel.

470
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:01,262
Rym: As you know Marvel Marvel's made a bunch of stuff.

471
00:37:01,665 --> 00:37:02,190
Scott: When's Marvel?

472
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:10,757
Rym: So I'll be honest I wasn't familiar with The Moon Girl or I guess originally Moon Boy or Devil Dinosaur Like.

473
00:37:10,797 --> 00:37:13,402
Rym: that was not a part of the Marvel universe I knew anything about.

474
00:37:13,422 --> 00:37:21,610
Scott: I knew I knew that they were characters In Marvel comic books but I had never Read a single comic book or seen Anything that contained them.

475
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:26,057
Rym: I don't think I knew that Devil Dinosaur Existed until I saw it in Marvel Snap.

476
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:35,810
Scott: to be honest Devil Dinosaur is a character that I knew existed in the Marvel universe But I had never read even a single Comic book or seen any cartoon or any Anything that had Devil Dinosaur in it.

477
00:37:35,891 --> 00:37:38,658
Scott: I didn't even have a collectible card with Devil Dinosaur on it.

478
00:37:38,699 --> 00:37:47,190
Scott: but I knew there was a Marvel character called Devil Dinosaur And that character was indeed A literal dinosaur And that was the extent of my knowledge.

479
00:37:47,553 --> 00:37:58,509
Rym: I spent before this show About 45 seconds Reading about The origin of Devil Dinosaur And the origin of Moon Boy Which came before Moon Girl.

480
00:37:59,295 --> 00:38:00,565
Scott: I didn't know anything about this.

481
00:38:00,605 --> 00:38:06,110
Scott: so tell me All I knew was that they were characters That existed with those names in Marvel comics.

482
00:38:06,275 --> 00:38:07,659
Scott: The end So it's.

483
00:38:09,396 --> 00:38:13,329
Rym: I don't want to say it's bad But it's not good.

484
00:38:14,235 --> 00:38:16,710
Rym: Okay It's Jack Kirby.

485
00:38:16,952 --> 00:38:18,650
Rym: Jack Kirby was the one who brought this out.

486
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:20,269
Rym: This is 70's Marvel.

487
00:38:21,112 --> 00:38:30,930
Rym: Moon Boy is a Monkey man who comes from a Dinosaur planet And Devil Dinosaur is smarter than him And I lost interest after that point.

488
00:38:31,051 --> 00:38:37,448
Rym: So I don't actually know anything else Okay But they come from a planet where there's a bunch of terrible crap going on And it sucks.

489
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:43,129
Scott: Maybe I will go read The first issue of Wherever that happens and know the deal.

490
00:38:44,194 --> 00:38:45,969
Rym: That should only take me like Five minutes.

491
00:38:46,151 --> 00:38:55,030
Rym: So at least it is in it's own comic called Devil Dinosaur volume 1 Alright Written and drawn by Jack Kirby in 1978.

492
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:58,250
Scott: Alright well I'm sure that I can read that In about five minutes.

493
00:38:59,282 --> 00:39:12,670
Rym: I don't think Literally anything From the entire history Of Moon Boy or Devil Dinosaur In any way matters to The modern Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur.

494
00:39:12,771 --> 00:39:15,349
Scott: They might as well be Completely separate things.

495
00:39:16,693 --> 00:39:23,887
Scott: There's no way for me to know if there are Callbacks or connections Between the two obviously because I didn't even Know anything about the original.

496
00:39:23,988 --> 00:39:26,510
Scott: but If there are they don't matter.

497
00:39:27,178 --> 00:39:30,050
Scott: You don't need to know them And they might not even exist.

498
00:39:30,393 --> 00:39:38,530
Rym: The only other thing I learned which If you watch Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur Is pretty apparent within about Four interactions with the Devil Dinosaur.

499
00:39:39,563 --> 00:39:44,820
Rym: Devil Dinosaur Is canonically as smart as or smarter Than a human like straight up Just day one.

500
00:39:45,284 --> 00:39:46,648
Rym: the Devil Dino Knows his shit.

501
00:39:48,295 --> 00:40:02,084
Rym: So Marvel released Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur animated show And the cool thing is the First episode which is a straight Up Marvel origin Story of a character Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur Two characters.

502
00:40:02,125 --> 00:40:04,822
Rym: I guess It's just free on YouTube.

503
00:40:04,983 --> 00:40:05,670
Rym: you can just watch it.

504
00:40:05,771 --> 00:40:06,750
Rym: It's like a double episode.

505
00:40:07,173 --> 00:40:10,279
Rym: The second episode of the show is also Just free on YouTube.

506
00:40:10,682 --> 00:40:12,620

00:40:12,681 --> 00:40:14,688
Rym: but those two Episodes are just free.

508
00:40:15,979 --> 00:40:17,510

00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:18,297
Scott: They're on Disney Plus?

510
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,045

511
00:40:20,353 --> 00:40:23,309
Rym: Okay I watched the free Episodes and then I stopped.

512
00:40:24,536 --> 00:40:30,264
Scott: I watched one free Episode the big The big long first one And it's pretty good.

513
00:40:30,284 --> 00:40:31,514
Rym: there's a lot going On here.

514
00:40:31,535 --> 00:40:33,010
Rym: we're going to review it right now.

515
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:42,260
Scott: There are eight episodes in one Season and It premiered on Disney Channel and was released On Disney Plus Five days after that.

516
00:40:42,421 --> 00:40:43,187
Rym: alright there we go.

517
00:40:44,158 --> 00:40:44,666
Rym: You can watch.

518
00:40:44,707 --> 00:40:50,142
Rym: at least You can watch 66 Minutes of this free And honestly.

519
00:40:50,485 --> 00:40:55,584
Rym: if nothing else I think it's worth watching the first episode Cause one free like Who can't argue with that?

520
00:40:55,604 --> 00:40:55,848
Rym: and two.

521
00:40:57,353 --> 00:40:59,898
Rym: It's basically kind of a stand alone Movie.

522
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,569
Scott: I think there might be 11 episodes If you watch that first episode.

523
00:41:02,731 --> 00:41:04,710
Rym: It's kind of a 44 minute like mini movie.

524
00:41:05,094 --> 00:41:10,890
Rym: That ends at a pretty satisfying Place and if it's not your jam You can stop there and still be satisfied.

525
00:41:12,915 --> 00:41:14,189
Rym: I guess we can talk about.

526
00:41:14,594 --> 00:41:17,235
Rym: The plot is pretty Simple.

527
00:41:17,256 --> 00:41:20,163
Rym: the show is definitely aimed at Young children like.

528
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:24,410
Rym: it is Extremely simple Very straightforward.

529
00:41:25,314 --> 00:41:26,970
Rym: The dialogue is doing its job.

530
00:41:27,274 --> 00:41:28,127
Rym: Is what I would say?

531
00:41:30,038 --> 00:41:34,087
Scott: Ah so I'm reading about The moon girl comic from 2015.

532
00:41:34,087 --> 00:41:42,102
Scott: Ah And that is also I think significantly what I'm reading On Wikipedia at least is that There are also.

533
00:41:42,122 --> 00:41:45,294
Scott: it's significantly Different from what's happening in this Cartoon.

534
00:41:45,314 --> 00:41:47,313
Rym: yeah so this cartoon what's The deal?

535
00:41:47,757 --> 00:41:51,820
Rym: we're in New York City Modern place Modern times.

536
00:41:52,224 --> 00:41:54,385
Rym: Marvel universe Exists like all that.

537
00:41:54,405 --> 00:41:56,809
Rym: stuff is out There and Spiderman lives there.

538
00:41:57,011 --> 00:42:08,586
Rym: Right yeah Marvel so and Moon girl just a cool girl Who is into science with a cool Family living in a Cool part of the city running a roller Rink which does not exist.

539
00:42:08,606 --> 00:42:10,910
Scott: there is no Roller rink in the Lower East Side no room.

540
00:42:10,931 --> 00:42:11,346
Scott: This is.

541
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:25,666
Rym: The problem is I feel like The New York City portrayed here is the New York City from Into the Spiderverse the Not actual New York City Because that is a way cooler Lower East Side than what we got going on.

542
00:42:28,084 --> 00:42:29,483
Rym: But Yeah she's there.

543
00:42:29,726 --> 00:42:30,658
Rym: she's super Into science.

544
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:35,990
Rym: she's super smart She's a secret Almost super hero.

545
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:36,919
Rym: Who's going through?

546
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,723
Rym: her origin story Coming of age?

547
00:42:38,743 --> 00:42:42,495
Scott: basically Yeah basically it's a little bit Dexter's lab going On right.

548
00:42:42,535 --> 00:42:49,060
Scott: it's like she goes in her bedroom She goes in like the closet and it goes down Underneath to like an abandoned subway tunnel Or some shit.

549
00:42:49,201 --> 00:42:51,490
Scott: yup and she's got You know her shit down there right.

550
00:42:51,671 --> 00:42:56,799
Rym: It is very obvious that her entire family Knows what she's up to and Approves like.

551
00:42:56,839 --> 00:43:02,757
Rym: that is that is Telegraph from a mile away That they all know the deal and She doesn't know.

552
00:43:02,798 --> 00:43:11,280
Rym: her family knows because she's A naive child but Everyone knows and she's basically Living in the cool Lower East Side The cool family.

553
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:20,556
Rym: it's a pretty Good representation of an idealized New York City though it's Not a hundred percent real Because there's a bodega that's called A bodega.

554
00:43:20,879 --> 00:43:23,201
Rym: now that's bodegas In New York don't have names.

555
00:43:23,262 --> 00:43:27,726
Scott: unless you look at city Records and those names they do have a name Sometimes printed on the awning.

556
00:43:27,787 --> 00:43:28,736
Scott: sometimes No one calls.

557
00:43:28,837 --> 00:43:33,470
Scott: nobody calls them by the Name that they have on there and there's Often a real name.

558
00:43:34,718 --> 00:43:39,350
Rym: And the name of a business Is they Are not what you would expect.

559
00:43:40,253 --> 00:43:41,344
Rym: They are kind of random.

560
00:43:41,424 --> 00:43:42,455
Rym: they're all over The place.

561
00:43:42,697 --> 00:43:45,445
Rym: there's bodegas but there's No bodega called bodega.

562
00:43:45,465 --> 00:43:59,530
Rym: but in this Universe the bodega is called bodega Okay But otherwise She is obsessed with This astronaut who I guess Disappeared or something and left some tech Behind and she's trying to figure out the deal.

563
00:43:59,953 --> 00:44:10,244
Rym: And she accidentally summons a gigantic dinosaur Who is Totally cool and an awesome Pet and then she Becomes a superhero and that's pretty much what Happens.

564
00:44:12,623 --> 00:44:18,798
Scott: The thing I like the most about This show was that In which he's in school Right.

565
00:44:19,263 --> 00:44:34,357
Scott: there was this Other student who's like the friend student Right and in the first scene with The friend the friend is Portrayed as first of all not A friend right as Some sort of popular girl Who is you know the exact opposite of Moon girl

566
00:44:34,418 --> 00:44:35,209
Rym: living for the tiktok

567
00:44:36,041 --> 00:44:40,149
Scott: Who is all into like tiktok social Media ing and that sort of biz.

568
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:42,696
Scott: And you know Is like.

569
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:47,042
Scott: you know you think that's Gonna be like a villain or a bully Of some kind.

570
00:44:47,062 --> 00:44:52,333
Scott: right Following the typical tropes of a school Story right it's like nerdy Girl.

571
00:44:52,454 --> 00:44:58,801
Scott: and then social media Popular girl and they're gonna be at odds Right and In you know.

572
00:44:58,962 --> 00:45:15,425
Scott: indeed I think after That first scene they are Sort of you know at odds but Basically like the second Third time it's like actually No right They sort of team up And they team up in a positive Way right.

573
00:45:15,526 --> 00:45:15,849
Scott: it's like.

574
00:45:16,334 --> 00:45:21,829
Rym: You know like immediately and they team up In a way that is very modern to kids And this is something I do appreciate too.

575
00:45:22,358 --> 00:45:25,646
Rym: This show Definitely acts like.

576
00:45:25,969 --> 00:45:39,546
Rym: it Understands how kids use technology And how their lives work and the fact that Social media and smartphones exist And the you know The way they portray the using Of social media is In a positive way right?

577
00:45:39,627 --> 00:45:39,889
Scott: it's like.

578
00:45:40,354 --> 00:45:53,545
Scott: It's like yes they're using it To like get themselves out there and be You know popular you know Get clout or whatever right And bring attention to things But they're not doing anything with it that would Be considered like.

579
00:45:54,171 --> 00:45:57,669
Scott: You know the bad behavior that You usually see from.

580
00:45:57,992 --> 00:46:13,768
Scott: You know those sorts of people right get it you know Annoying people with it getting people In there who do you know don't want to be on There harassing people Invading people's privacy Doing you know Too much capitalisms right You know anything like that.

581
00:46:13,788 --> 00:46:25,328
Scott: it's like They're just using it in a. You know they're using it perhaps too much Yeah But they're using it in a Good example of at least How to use it somewhat responsibly.

582
00:46:25,611 --> 00:46:33,341
Rym: The show is largely a lot of kids And adults being pretty good role models For kids which Is a good portrayal.

583
00:46:33,603 --> 00:46:37,809
Rym: the the villains Are appropriate To the stakes.

584
00:46:38,374 --> 00:46:44,008
Scott: I think I mean the villain really Felt like a a spider-man villain You know which is appropriate for one.

585
00:46:44,028 --> 00:46:45,462
Scott: a New York story.

586
00:46:45,583 --> 00:46:49,945
Rym: definitely I feel like if she'd actually killed All those people spider-man would have showed up.

587
00:46:51,158 --> 00:46:53,766
Scott: Yeah probably I don't know Someone would have showed up but it's like.

588
00:46:54,864 --> 00:47:00,387
Scott: Um Yeah but I think if You are if you're a kid who is?

589
00:47:00,892 --> 00:47:08,430
Scott: Perhaps you know I don't know if it's a. I guess it would Be about the same age target As a My Little Pony maybe a little bit older.

590
00:47:08,813 --> 00:47:11,701
Rym: Yeah maybe a little younger actually Could be.

591
00:47:11,761 --> 00:47:12,630
Scott: it's like around the same.

592
00:47:12,812 --> 00:47:14,330
Scott: I guess you know young kids.

593
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:15,650
Scott: It's like you understand English.

594
00:47:16,171 --> 00:47:20,128
Scott: You're too old for Sesame Street But you know you're too young for.

595
00:47:20,713 --> 00:47:22,390
Scott: You know The Simpsons I don't know.

596
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:24,915
Rym: But especially too it is very It is.

597
00:47:25,239 --> 00:47:32,210
Rym: it is not Centering whiteness In like very directly And that is clearly a big part of the show.

598
00:47:32,331 --> 00:47:32,533
Rym: It is.

599
00:47:32,938 --> 00:47:38,270
Rym: it is de-centering that To a strong degree and it's a very Very diverse cast for a reason.

600
00:47:38,714 --> 00:47:44,150
Scott: The voice acting I think it's a. It's a you know New York cast Yeah and the voice acting.

601
00:47:44,292 --> 00:47:54,330
Rym: Even though the dialogue is extremely simple The voice acting is spot on like it's Very well done even if the actual words They say are very simple Plot moving Dialogue.

602
00:47:54,955 --> 00:48:06,280
Rym: But the thing that stands out the main reason I would say you as a GeekNights listener I don't think we have any like nine year old GeekNights listeners Is that the animation Is fantastic.

603
00:48:06,502 --> 00:48:09,916
Rym: you know Spider-Verse Like captured a very particular Style.

604
00:48:10,522 --> 00:48:15,758
Rym: well this Really captures 2D newspaper Print comics.

605
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,817
Rym: the backgrounds are Very flat.

606
00:48:17,898 --> 00:48:19,190
Rym: the characters are very flat.

607
00:48:19,533 --> 00:48:22,038
Rym: The special effects are done in A really interesting way.

608
00:48:22,361 --> 00:48:25,290
Rym: this is visually On the edge of stunning.

609
00:48:25,572 --> 00:48:29,089
Rym: Regardless of anything else I would watch Anything animated in this style.

610
00:48:31,474 --> 00:48:34,241
Rym: That is that is it's so Well done right?

611
00:48:34,282 --> 00:48:47,797
Scott: so perhaps the coolest Thing about this show is not anything in The show itself but the story of How the show came to be Because none other Than Morpheus the Lawrence Fishburne

612
00:48:47,979 --> 00:48:52,650
Rym: I was about to say because he He plays the Beyonder in this Show in one of the episodes

613
00:48:53,295 --> 00:48:53,578
Scott: Right.

614
00:48:53,961 --> 00:49:00,608
Scott: so he Read the comic book that Rym thinks is probably bad the Moon Boy When he was a young right.

615
00:49:01,314 --> 00:49:05,716
Scott: And he found out that the Moon Girl Comics from 2000 whatever Existed.

616
00:49:06,686 --> 00:49:10,670
Scott: and then He read those and he says Oh this should be a cartoon.

617
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:13,594
Scott: And so he was the executive producer For it.

618
00:49:13,655 --> 00:49:18,119
Scott: right but it wasn't one of those situations Where like you just slap in your name on something But you get no credit.

619
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:19,210
Scott: he clearly like believed.

620
00:49:19,472 --> 00:49:21,050
Scott: He's like right he was like.

621
00:49:21,111 --> 00:49:21,534
Scott: He was like.

622
00:49:21,655 --> 00:49:22,099
Scott: oh I like.

623
00:49:22,119 --> 00:49:23,269
Scott: you know let's make this happen.

624
00:49:23,573 --> 00:49:24,886
Scott: And he you know he made it happen.

625
00:49:24,906 --> 00:49:31,717
Scott: the other Big name involved Which makes obviously perfect sense Is Steve Loader Right.

626
00:49:31,737 --> 00:49:35,817
Scott: you know Who is a Kim Possible you know Key person.

627
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:42,443
Scott: so and that Makes perfect sense because you look at the show and you're like Oh yeah I can see the I can see the Connection definitely see it.

628
00:49:42,868 --> 00:49:50,685
Rym: so I would say anyone Who listens to GeekNights it is worth It to at least watch the first episode Because it ends at a satisfying point.

629
00:49:50,726 --> 00:49:51,655
Rym: treat it like a Mini movie.

630
00:49:51,939 --> 00:49:54,248
Rym: the animation is great There's a lot of good stuff going on.

631
00:49:55,035 --> 00:49:58,930
Rym: But if you got kids this show I feel like it'll just hit.

632
00:49:59,273 --> 00:49:59,758
Rym: It'll hit them.

633
00:49:59,778 --> 00:50:01,322
Rym: I think they'd be into It.

634
00:50:03,113 --> 00:50:06,910
Rym: I don't know if I'm gonna watch the rest of it aggressively But I feel like at some point I'll watch it all.

635
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:08,570
Rym: There won't be that much of it I imagine.

636
00:50:09,413 --> 00:50:11,574
Scott: Yeah I don't think this is something that I'm gonna Like.

637
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:16,425
Scott: go and spend my time Watching a whole bunch of but like if it was on I would watch it right?

638
00:50:16,445 --> 00:50:20,018
Scott: Oh absolutely And then I would tell someone else To watch it.

639
00:50:20,503 --> 00:50:24,019
Scott: but uh Especially if they are a child In this year.

640
00:50:24,685 --> 00:50:26,306
Scott: but am I Gonna watch it you know?

641
00:50:27,173 --> 00:50:27,810
Scott: Eh maybe.

642
00:50:28,635 --> 00:50:30,807
Scott: But that doesn't mean it's no good.

643
00:50:30,847 --> 00:50:32,067
Scott: that just means I got no time.

644
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:34,370
Scott: I'd watch lots of television.

645
00:50:34,471 --> 00:50:38,947
Rym: The Devil Dinosaur himself is just extremely Cute and very well done.

646
