00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,748
Rym: It's Tuesday, March 21st, 2023.

2
00:00:09,748 --> 00:00:09,909
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,165 --> 00:00:13,660
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:15,740
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight.

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,980
Rym: We're talking about a delightful little game called Stacklands.

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,398
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:33,520
Rym: So I know we did a review a while ago, Marvel Snap, when it came out, and I remember, Scott, you said something, you were very, very clear that you were going to play the game until you lost.

8
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,438
Rym: You beat all the bots.

9
00:00:34,882 --> 00:00:35,806
Rym: You lost one match.

10
00:00:35,826 --> 00:00:37,856
Rym: that was a scripted loss, and you said you were done.

11
00:00:37,896 --> 00:00:38,660
Rym: You never played again.

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:46,320
Scott: No, I said I would not play it again until they added some friend-on-friend kind of action.

13
00:00:46,901 --> 00:00:48,940
Scott: And they did, and that is what I started playing.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,940
Rym: How many friend-on-friend games have you played compared to playing against randos and bots?

15
00:00:54,561 --> 00:00:56,800
Scott: We organized a whole friend-on-friend tournament.

16
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:57,572
Rym: Yeah, but how many?

17
00:00:57,592 --> 00:00:57,980
Rym: I'm just curious.

18
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:58,683
Rym: And I did a lot better.

19
00:00:58,743 --> 00:00:59,788
Scott: I eliminated you.

20
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:04,580
Scott: We both lost our first matches, and we went to the Losers Bracket, where I eliminated you.

21
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,720
Scott: You won zero matches in that tournament.

22
00:01:06,781 --> 00:01:07,279
Rym: That is true.

23
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,900
Scott: You were completely eliminated with no victories.

24
00:01:14,088 --> 00:01:36,360
Scott: I went all the way through the Losers Bracket and lost in the final match of the Losers Bracket, which I guess is sort of, I guess, third or fourth place, because I guess whoever lost in the winners, whoever... No, no, I guess that would be third place, because whoever lost in the winners bracket last came, who was in second place, came down to me, beat me, and went back up.

25
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:36,733
Scott: Yeah.

26
00:01:37,321 --> 00:01:40,300
Scott: So I was in third place, and you were dead last place.

27
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:48,380
Rym: Yeah, but I'm just curious how many games have you played against bots and randos compared to the actual total number of games you've played against people you know?

28
00:01:49,521 --> 00:01:50,385
Scott: I would love to play.

29
00:01:50,425 --> 00:01:53,240
Scott: I mean, yes, I have played more games against bots and randos.

30
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,432
Rym: Yeah, one order of magnitude, two orders.

31
00:01:55,452 --> 00:02:00,340
Rym: I think it's at least two orders of magnitude based on your collector level, which is significantly higher than mine.

32
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,839
Rym: You play this game a lot more than I do.

33
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:08,860
Scott: That, well, the collector level is so high because of my strategy of every morning play until I complete all quests.

34
00:02:09,542 --> 00:02:10,287
Rym: I do not do that.

35
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:12,260
Rym: I just kind of play when I feel like it, like when I'm pooping.

36
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,420
Scott: Yeah, see, every single morning complete all six quests.

37
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:31,300
Scott: Every morning it takes 10, most days takes 10 minutes, and then there have been a couple of occasions where I have played additionally, but the vast majority of my play against bots is the 10 minutes every morning to complete all quests.

38
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:40,760
Scott: Just because all I want is to get every card, because then if I get every card, then I can actually go to- This game's going to be designed to make sure you never have every card.

39
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,260
Scott: We'll see, but I'm going to try to get every card.

40
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,580
Scott: There are people who have every card, so- Yeah, I'll put more cards in common.

41
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,265
Scott: And I'm catching up.

42
00:02:48,305 --> 00:02:49,231
Scott: I'm gaining cards.

43
00:02:49,311 --> 00:02:50,600
Scott: They are releasing more cards.

44
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,200
Scott: I'm gaining cards faster than they're releasing.

45
00:02:53,761 --> 00:02:57,460
Rym: Yeah, the thing is, the only card I want, the only card I want right now is Dracula.

46
00:02:58,389 --> 00:02:58,920
Scott: I got Dracula.

47
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:00,151
Rym: I know.

48
00:03:00,293 --> 00:03:05,228
Scott: What's funny- Maybe you should do what I do and play every single morning, do all six- No, I ain't doing work.

49
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:05,853
Rym: This game's fun.

50
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:06,539
Rym: It's not that fun.

51
00:03:07,782 --> 00:03:08,888
Scott: It takes 10 minutes a day.

52
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:11,443
Scott: If you're playing on a pooper- I ain't doing work.

53
00:03:11,504 --> 00:03:13,559
Rym: That is suspiciously like grinding.

54
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,446
Scott: Maybe it's 10 minutes.

55
00:03:15,567 --> 00:03:16,995
Scott: Maybe you should eat some more fiber.

56
00:03:17,016 --> 00:03:21,620
Scott: You'll poop more, and then you'll poop enough to do six quests a day.

57
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,872
Scott: I don't even look at the quests unless I just sort

58
00:03:24,892 --> 00:03:35,520
Rym: of play- A bunch of quests are done, and then I click on all the ones that are done, and then I look at whatever one's left, and I decide if I'm gonna bother or not, because if I gotta change decks to do it-

59
00:03:37,122 --> 00:03:42,698
Scott: It's very rare that there'll be a quest that's like, "Oh, you actually need to play a discard deck to complete this

60
00:03:42,758 --> 00:03:42,959
Scott: quest.".

61
00:03:44,043 --> 00:03:45,778
Scott: Or like a move deck, like move 10 cards.

62
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,800
Rym: Move deck was the one I had trouble with, because I have two decks.

63
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,400
Rym: I have a reaction/anti-meta deck that I don't really play often.

64
00:03:53,821 --> 00:03:55,540
Rym: Really only use it to occasionally finish a quest.

65
00:03:55,922 --> 00:03:58,480
Rym: And then I got my discard deck that I've been really focused on lately.

66
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:04,148
Scott: Yeah, I just threw together, you know, random move deck of just a whole- Every card says move on it.

67
00:04:04,651 --> 00:04:06,120
Scott: It's just a quest completion deck.

68
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:11,740
Scott: And then when I get one of those random quests, it'll take me like, you know, two matches.

69
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:17,298
Rym: So I'll tell you something I have done, and I encourage you to do this too, because I think a lot of people get away with this.

70
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:19,870
Rym: I do look at- I do skim occasionally.

71
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:23,999
Rym: I look at if there's a quest that would- I expect people would make a deck just to do it.

72
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,640
Rym: Win a location with one card versus win a location with four cards.

73
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,398
Rym: The kinds of things people will just crank out.

74
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:41,480
Rym: And if I even remotely think that someone has a deck that is basically designed to finish one of those quests that's active, I'll just snap immediately, snap aggressively, like I know I'm gonna win because that deck's probably crap.

75
00:04:42,621 --> 00:04:44,660
Scott: I mean, I don't see that too often though.

76
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:50,012
Scott: I guess when you're at rank 70-something, you don't see those- I'm 64 right now.

77
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:56,341
Scott: I don't play that much, but- I mean, they added the new five-rank boost when you hit a 10.

78
00:04:56,341 --> 00:05:01,458
Rym: It's real easy to rank up till you hit around like 70-75, and then the sweaty people are there.

79
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,080
Scott: Yeah, but they are- you know, I hate ladders, right?

80
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,140
Scott: We've talked about that before.

81
00:05:05,261 --> 00:05:08,240
Scott: But they are adding a non-ladder competitive mode.

82
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:15,498
Scott: that seems much more in line with the sort of tournament competition that I am a fan of, so we'll see what that looks like when it appears.

83
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:36,500
Rym: Yep, what I'm enjoying the most is seeing people come- people who clearly haven't played like- they haven't internalized the lessons of every collectible game in the history of collectible games, and they get mad about the changing meta, or they like to play a certain way and then the meta changes and that card doesn't work anymore, and freaking out about nerfs and buffs, and it's always fun to watch people get way too sweaty about that stuff.

84
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,719
Scott: That's what a card game is.

85
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,120
Scott: If you're not here for that, then you're in the wrong place.

86
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,820
Scott: That's what this is, right?

87
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:48,100
Rym: Do you want the overpowered card that nobody likes that literally everyone is playing because it's so overpowered?

88
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,600
Rym: Do you want the game to just be that forever?

89
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:50,619
Rym: No, of course not.

90
00:05:50,701 --> 00:05:53,939
Rym: That's why they nerfed it, because they fucked up when they designed it.

91
00:05:54,420 --> 00:06:02,740
Scott: And right now, the only thing that I complain about- yeah, the only things that I complain about are, number one, you know, they write the rules poorly.

92
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,640
Scott: Very- this is like- it's pretty bad.

93
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:12,839
Scott: I would argue that does not matter at all to the game, and there's probably- I mean, it doesn't matter for most people, but I'm still going to complain about it.

94
00:06:13,061 --> 00:06:14,400
Rym: It's something I would like to see changed.

95
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:20,940
Rym: I'm saying there are probably like 11 people on earth who care about that, and nine of them are in our Discord.

96
00:06:21,482 --> 00:06:24,979
Rym: I think more people- The other two are listening to this podcast right now.

97
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,973
Scott: It's- I think there's a lot of people, but it's a very small percentage.

98
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:40,400
Rym: The kind of person who goes to GeekNights' panels on purpose or would enjoy them if they got tricked into going to one, those are the people who would actually- Right, but I'm one of those- I'm one of those people.

99
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:40,698
Scott: Yeah.

100
00:06:41,243 --> 00:06:55,559
Scott: And the other thing that I complain about, which is something that seems like a lot of people, you know, don't agree with me, but it's like every single card game since that has had the sort of magic the gathering system- Oh, you're still mad about the monocurve?

101
00:06:55,841 --> 00:06:57,760
Rym: I think technologies move forward.

102
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,480
Rym: Monocurve fuckery is fine if handled with care.

103
00:07:00,882 --> 00:07:03,860
Rym: It just was done poorly and dangerously in previous games.

104
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,700
Scott: It's done poorly and dangerously in this game as well.

105
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:12,076
Rym: Oh, so none of those decks are in the broken- Every single of the top meta decks.

106
00:07:12,238 --> 00:07:18,840
Scott: always, every single one involves playing cards below cost or getting extra energy from somewhere.

107
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:28,020
Scott: Every- look, every meta- every top deck in the meta- Every worker plays the game with like one exception, getting another baby is always a great idea.

108
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,319
Rym: That's a big part of the meta.

109
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,240
Scott: That's exactly correct.

110
00:07:33,292 --> 00:07:42,820
Rym: But I don't- I think they've got a good balance though, at least for now, of the handful of monocurve fuckeries that have been like broken broken, they have addressed.

111
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:51,432
Scott: Yeah, they didn't let it get way out of control, but it's still like, I would love to see- I've never seen, if anyone knows of one, please let me know, right?

112
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,888
Scott: But it's like, Magic the Gathering, you know, the way Magic.

113
00:07:54,929 --> 00:08:02,300
Scott: the Gathering worked, it was the first game like this that I know of, and it was like, you could get a land a turn if you got a land, right?

114
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,600
Scott: It's like sometimes you ran out of land.

115
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:08,280
Rym: I think putting land in the deck was a mistake and no one thought about that.

116
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,500
Scott: I agree, but that's a separate topic.

117
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:15,080
Scott: Basically, it was you increase your currency supply by one per turn and the game scales up.

118
00:08:15,281 --> 00:08:18,640
Scott: You start playing small cards and you later play big cards.

119
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,820
Scott: That's a really good design overall for a lot of reasons.

120
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:25,160
Rym: Get that Basalt Monolith on turn four, you play a six or seven power card.

121
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:46,020
Scott: Okay, but regardless, the very first cards, the very first cards that were banned in the very first game like this were Black Lotus, Moxes, or Restricted, Zorings, all these cards that let you get more mana that increase ahead of the curve.

122
00:08:46,441 --> 00:08:50,060
Rym: There are plenty of cards in modern Magic that do that.

123
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:56,000
Rym: The only problem with those cards is one, their cost of zero was like mega dangerous.

124
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:01,280
Rym: They were like, we're talking about a very narrow band of feasibility on moniker fuckery.

125
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,979
Rym: These things were all the way at the left.

126
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:07,240
Scott: Yes, but there is obviously degrees of badness.

127
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,600
Rym: There's tons of cards in Magic today.

128
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,580
Scott: If Black Lotus costs five or seven, people probably wouldn't be playing it, right?

129
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:46,040
Scott: It's like, obviously, but the point is, is that if you look at every other card game that has come since with the same sort of curve system, the common thread of cards that are banned, restricted, nerfed, OP, et cetera, is that almost all of them and almost all of the top meta decks in every card game, all different games, is that there is a common thread of things that let you reduce cost and things that let you get more energy.

130
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:50,139
Rym: Now, I would like to see your data, like what card games have you looked at?

131
00:09:51,482 --> 00:09:55,960
Scott: It is, I mean, this is anecdotal, but every game that I've played, and some I haven't, right?

132
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,689
Rym: you got your anecdote.

133
00:09:59,252 --> 00:10:05,259
Rym: come down to Marvel Snap, a couple of card games we've heard of, the Magic we both played for 1% of the existing Magic.

134
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:16,759
Scott: I'm just saying, I have never seen, and this is what I want the listener to, if the listener knows of one, I have never seen such a Magic-ish styled game where you get energy per turn, right?

135
00:10:18,105 --> 00:10:25,439
Rym: Another good example- the SimCity CCG might, I wanna say, I can't think of anything that fucked with the mana curve that I saw in that game.

136
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:31,200
Scott:  But even when we played recently that miniatures game, the Moon, what was it called?

137
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,020
Scott:  Oh yeah, Moonbreaker or whatever.

138
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:40,280
Scott:  Moonbreaker, the one character that let you decrease the cost on your units and bring them out, was the just OP strongest one, right?

139
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,780
Rym:  Well, 'cause they made it too powerful, it had to be less of an increase.

140
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:48,820
Scott: But it's like, I would love to see a game with the sort of mana curve, right?

141
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,200
Scott: Or some sort of currency for playing units or cards.

142
00:10:52,602 --> 00:10:56,791
Scott: where the curve is set, there is no cheating the curve, period.

143
00:10:56,811 --> 00:10:59,916
Rym:  I am confident there are tons of games like that, but I also think that-.

144
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,016
Scott:  I, do you know of one?

145
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,299
Rym:  I'm confident there's a bunch out there.

146
00:11:03,861 --> 00:11:05,780
Rym: There's so many of these games out there.

147
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,020
Scott:  I mean, I totally believe there could be many there 'cause there are so many games and I only know a small fraction of them, right?

148
00:11:12,262 --> 00:11:13,299
Scott: But can you name one?

149
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,259
Rym:  Yeah, I mean, I don't play card games.

150
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,540
Rym: I barely play Marvel Snap.

151
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,200
Scott:  Right, exactly.

152
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:21,559
Scott: So if there is such a game, I don't disbelieve that there is.

153
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,300
Rym:  Here's my guess though.

154
00:11:22,421 --> 00:11:24,279
Scott:  I have never seen one.

155
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:24,698
Scott:  I'll bet.

156
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,300
Scott:  And I would love to try one to see what that's like.

157
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:32,660
Rym:  I will bet every single game that has no possible mana curve fuckery is also bad.

158
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,396
Scott:  I didn't say it.

159
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:46,239
Rym: That doesn't make it, you know, that's not like if you fix this, it's not like, oh, you fix this one thing, - But I'm saying partly 'cause I point out that Magic, modern Magic has tons of cards that fuck with the mana curve.

160
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,559
Rym: They just aren't extreme like the Moxes.

161
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,199
Scott:  Sure, I'm just saying, yeah, I would love to see a card, a game that doesn't let you fuck with it.

162
00:11:55,542 --> 00:12:09,780
Scott: And I have thought of some game designs where you could still keep it interesting by not letting anyone get more currency but also not just having a boring curve then, but doing something else with the currency, right?

163
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,580
Scott: But not letting anyone get more or cut costs, right?

164
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:24,440
Scott: 'Cause the really core problem is that when people design these games, they design sort of the cards, not entirely in isolation, but they design them thinking about that card and a few other cards, right?

165
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,640
Scott: You can't take every card into consideration, right?

166
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,999
Rym:  Well, eventually we will 'cause the way I think companies will move in this unless the economy collapses is exactly that.

167
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,440
Scott:  Machine learning can help you design.

168
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:40,159
Rym:  You'll just constantly run bots against bots against bots and figure out the top and bottom of the meta and use that to tune.

169
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,319
Scott:  Yep, that would be great, but that's not here quite yet.

170
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,698
Rym:  I think it's gonna be here within a couple years.

171
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:53,760
Scott:  When people design cards by hand, what they do is they arrange all the powers and abilities and most often they set the cost last, right?

172
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,380
Scott: They're like, okay, a 10/10 in Magic, that's really big.

173
00:12:57,701 --> 00:12:59,620
Scott: That should cost a lot of mana, right?

174
00:12:59,921 --> 00:13:03,220
Scott: And the cost is very often only there for balancing.

175
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:15,120
Scott: And if you allow someone to cut the cost in any way or get more currency to bring things out in some way, you've just ruined the balance that you put into every card.

176
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,835
Rym:  Except the card that is played that causes.

177
00:13:17,876 --> 00:13:19,980
Rym: that itself has costs and consequences.

178
00:13:20,441 --> 00:13:22,379
Rym: Like Electro, I think is perfectly fine.

179
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,008
Scott:  I mean, he's not out there, but I still-.

180
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,739
Rym:  Maybe, I haven't looked at the data on how much in the meta he is right now.

181
00:13:34,361 --> 00:13:39,039
Rym: I'll also point out that when I see Electro, I insta-snap because anyone who's playing Electro always loses to me right now.

182
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,920
Scott:  Well, anyone who plays Electro is playing Galactus, right?

183
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:47,380
Rym: So I always snap because- - Or they're our friend Scott Johnson who just loves Electro for some reason.

184
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,980
Scott:  But Galactus is easy to counter, right?

185
00:13:51,584 --> 00:13:59,679
Scott: But the point is, is that that's actually a good example, is that Galactus, he's a 6/2, you play him at an empty location, he destroys the rest of the board.

186
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:06,620
Scott: So basically it allows you to win a game if someone has a really weak location that you haven't even played anything to, right?

187
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:11,380
Scott: It's sort of like this trap card- - It's gotta be so weak though.

188
00:14:12,562 --> 00:14:13,880
Scott:  Right, but it's okay.

189
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,060
Rym:  It's basically gotta be empty.

190
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,480
Scott:  On its own, it's okay.

191
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:24,580
Scott: But Electro, right, combined with Galactus lets you play Galactus on five instead of six, right?

192
00:14:25,042 --> 00:14:29,415
Scott: And then that lets people play Null and Death on turn six behind the Galactus, right?

193
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,079
Rym: Which is- - Assuming they got him.

194
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,619
Scott:  Right, assuming they got him.

195
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:40,680
Scott: But it's like, if you don't, if you're not a, you know, it's easy, you know, I guess it's, you know, okay that they designed that particular interaction.

196
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:50,688
Rym:  Well, I would argue that actually the problem there- - That it's so heavily telegraphed that you can avoid it, but- - Well, like the infinite is telegraphed if someone just doesn't fucking play anything on turn five, like very likely.

197
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:54,080
Scott:  But it's still, right, if there weren't ways to counter, right?

198
00:14:54,120 --> 00:15:01,420
Scott: It's like, that's still kind of messed up in that the Galactus on its own is now busted because you're letting someone play it early, right?

199
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:13,367
Scott: It would have been even better to, you know, it's like, aha, if you have a card that can counter the Galactus, or at least if you see it coming, you can retreat at minimum, but it would be even better if like, you just couldn't pull that bullshit in the first place.

200
00:15:13,387 --> 00:15:22,365
Rym:  Of course, when someone, if Galactus comes out, which that'd be a few times on turn five, both times I had Shang-Chi and I just- - Yeah.

201
00:15:22,386 --> 00:15:22,739
Scott:  And it was fun.

202
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,420
Scott:  Well, you have to hope you don't have priority.

203
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,126
Rym:  Yup.

204
00:15:25,146 --> 00:15:26,320
Rym:  Anyway.

205
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:32,520
Rym:  Anyway, in the news, so Scott and I played a lot of Counter-Strike back in the day.

206
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,920
Rym: We played the original pre-release Counter-Strike.

207
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:51,500
Scott:  I played Counter-Strike since it was like CS Beta something, and then CS, like, and then they, CS 1.0, and then that went all the way up to 1.6, and then- - The P90 was not in the game when we had already been playing for a while.

208
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:58,219
Rym: I remember when the P90 was added to the game, and then temporarily removed 'cause it was way too powerful, and then they brought it back super nerfed.

209
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:09,672
Scott:  Like when we played the Counter-Strike in the year 2000, there was a Counter-Strike, there was a forum, like a PHP VB forum on counter-strike.net, that was the official forum, and there would be a thread every day saying, "Ban the

210
00:16:09,712 --> 00:16:09,833
Scott: AWP.".

211
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:10,964
Scott:  Yup.

212
00:16:11,107 --> 00:16:13,860
Rym: (laughs) I think I have a screenshot of that in one of our old panels.

213
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:20,612
Scott:  But anyway, the Counter-Strike went to 1.6, then they had CS Source.

214
00:16:20,632 --> 00:16:21,179
Rym:  Yup.

215
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,229
Rym: it's funny, CS 6.

216
00:16:23,229 --> 00:16:24,159
Scott:  And then it's CS Go.

217
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:29,690
Rym:  CS 1.6, CS Source, CS Go, all three of them are still heavily played today, like it is terrifying.

218
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:31,593
Scott:  They're all basically the same damn game.

219
00:16:31,613 --> 00:16:31,978
Rym:  Yup.

220
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:33,989
Scott:  It's looking fancier.

221
00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:41,439
Rym:  And recently, like a few weeks ago, I booted up Counter-Strike Go, I hadn't played it in a while, I just wanted to see what was going on in there.

222
00:16:41,921 --> 00:16:42,350
Scott: There's a lot-.

223
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:42,860
Scott:  Skin trading.

224
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,696
Rym:  There's a lot going on in there-.

225
00:16:44,716 --> 00:16:45,670
Scott:  Skin gambling isn't going on in there.

226
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:52,419
Rym:  There's a lot more matchmaking, a lot more modes, a lot more maps, the game is still pretty great, if that's the kind of game you wanna play.

227
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,977
Scott:  There's a lot of skin gambling, that's what I'm saying.

228
00:16:54,997 --> 00:16:55,100
Rym:  Yup.

229
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,459
Rym: But it's easy to avoid that, you just don't interact with those people.

230
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:06,500
Scott:  Maybe you could, could I get so lucky that I could like boot it up once, play a match, somehow earn a skin that's like the rarest cocoa bean and sell it for a pile of money?

231
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,175
Scott:  So we were- - Could that happen?

232
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:19,939
Rym:  We were selling all of our old crap in Steam, and I looked, 'cause I wasn't gonna click through all my stuff and sell it, but I had a couple of CS items that people were buying for like seven, eight dollars.

233
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,308
Rym:  Whoa, all right.

234
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:21,818
Rym:  I sold 'em all.

235
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:23,431
Scott:  Yeah, why wouldn't you?

236
00:17:23,451 --> 00:17:26,654
Rym:  I looked at what the current bid ask was, - You could buy Marvel Snap cards with those.

237
00:17:26,674 --> 00:17:33,380
Rym:  Yeah, I sent it like a cent under it, so I made like 20 bucks just selling a few items, I didn't sell anything that was worth less than like a few dollars.

238
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,489
Scott:  Maybe that's why everyone's playing Counter-Strike, 'cause you get paid to play.

239
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:50,638
Rym:  So yeah, Counter-Strike is still a pretty good game, if I didn't have a job, I would definitely like still be playing Counter-Strike semi-regularly, I just, it is not above the line of do it and play all the other games I play and do GeekNights and have a job.

240
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,599
Scott:  So what's the Counter-Strike related news?

241
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:59,960
Rym:  Valve has been very slowly announcing that Counter-Strike 2 is coming.

242
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,680
Scott:  Is this actually true?

243
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,620
Scott: I've heard a lot, I've heard the same whispers, but I have not seen an official Valve news.

244
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:15,140
Rym:  Yeah, so they registered trademarks for CS2 and Counter-Strike 2, they put a new logo on some of their Valve-owned websites for Counter-Strike.

245
00:18:15,642 --> 00:18:16,067
Rym:  Okay.

246
00:18:16,088 --> 00:18:18,439
Rym:  I'm gonna link to an article that lists all--.

247
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:22,640
Scott:  I mean, I'm pretty sure it's happening, but the point is, this is still in rumor territory, right?

248
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,940
Rym:  It seems pretty valid.

249
00:18:25,781 --> 00:18:31,373
Scott:  I mean, yeah, but there's no official anything, it's just everyone knows.

250
00:18:31,433 --> 00:18:32,320
Scott: hush, hush, wink, wink.

251
00:18:32,882 --> 00:18:35,840
Scott: Like everyone knows the next iPhone is coming in September, wink, wink.

252
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:47,180
Rym:  So just a few weeks ago, Counter-Strike GO hit its all-time simultaneous player count, it hit 1.4 million concurrent players in games.

253
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,809
Scott: So it's still a huge game, and--.

254
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,196
Scott:  It's just not Fortnite big or Minecraft big, it's--.

255
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,358
Rym:  'Cause it's, you know, actually, that's kind of what our panel at PAX is about.

256
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:01,080
Rym:  You talk about Fortnite, and that's a more casual, fun game than Counter-Strike.

257
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:07,040
Rym: Counter-Strike, in serious competition, is the sweatiest fucking people you will ever interact with online.

258
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,319
Scott:  I'm curious if Fortnite or Candy Crush is more max simultaneous people.

259
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,460
Rym:  That, I bet Candy Crush, just 'cause a lot of people are pooping.

260
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,000
Scott:  It could be, I don't know, I don't know.

261
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,139
Rym:  How many people are pooping simultaneously on Earth?

262
00:19:20,884 --> 00:19:21,128
Rym: Anyway.

263
00:19:21,148 --> 00:19:21,959
Rym:  I don't know.

264
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:29,779
Rym:  So there is a strong indication, because Counter-Strike GO, despite hitting this record, is shockingly old.

265
00:19:31,942 --> 00:19:44,012
Rym: Counter-Strike 2 appears to be coming, and what I will promise all of you, 'cause having played Counter-Strike GO again recently, I actually really like Counter-Strike still, so I'm absolutely gonna play Counter-Strike 2, and see what they do.

266
00:19:44,032 --> 00:19:48,939
Scott:  I will play a non-zero amount of Counter-Strike 2, unless it costs a lot of money, but it'll probably be free-to-play, right?

267
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:54,719
Rym:  Well, I actually think Counter-Strike 2 would be better if it cost a small to modest amount of money.

268
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:57,260
Rym: Free-to-play is still a cancer on gaming.

269
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:09,739
Rym: Like, Overwatch 2, literally everything that is bad about Overwatch 2 is solely because of its free-to-play nature, and there are problems that did not exist in Overwatch 1, which cost money.

270
00:20:11,462 --> 00:20:14,100
Rym: So I hope Counter-Strike 2 is not free-to-play.

271
00:20:14,521 --> 00:20:17,140
Rym: I would pay 20 bucks, maybe I'd pay 40 bucks.

272
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:26,140
Scott:  I'm still waiting for a game to have a complete segregation of the people who pay, and the people who don't pay, and be like, "All right, you wanna play this game for free?

273
00:20:26,361 --> 00:20:29,476
Scott: "Here you go, we got the microtransactions, "we got all that stuff, pay us

274
00:20:29,516 --> 00:20:29,719
Scott: money.".

275
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:33,620
Rym:  Give us 20 bucks, same game, you only play with other people who pay 20 bucks.

276
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:53,200
Scott:  Everyone who cares about winning and losing, and doesn't care about any bullshit, and is actually a competitor of some kind, same exact game, you just gotta pay this flat fee, or subscription flat fee, you'll get absolutely everything, no cosmetic bullshit, just winning and losing, tournaments, et cetera, play over here, right?

277
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:59,679
Scott: Just, you don't even need different game modes, just literally, the same game, just two audiences that don't touch.

278
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:14,340
Rym:  'Cause I mean, the real problem is just capitalism, and the thing, the main problem with everything, so there's not much we can do about the fact that free-to-play is just going to be here, poisoning gaming, probably for most of the rest of our lives, unless something--.

279
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:17,720
Scott:  No, we can make the game that has what we want.

280
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:18,960
Rym:  'Cause we can't make any money.

281
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:23,839
Scott:  We can, as long as we just make enough money for ourselves only.

282
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,339
Rym:  I don't think we can even do that.

283
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:26,559
Scott:  I think you could.

284
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:41,140
Rym:  I don't think it's, I think it's so rare, that it's almost impossible, even Dwarf Fortress, as huge as that was, divide all the money they've made, by how many hours they spent making Dwarf Fortress.

285
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,359
Scott: That is not enough money to live on.

286
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,820
Scott:  We can make a smaller game.

287
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,359
Scott: We don't need to make that kind of game.

288
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:51,599
Rym:  The real answer, we should become independently wealthy and just make the game we want, and who fucking cares if anyone plays it?

289
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:52,414
Scott:  Anyway.

290
00:21:53,180 --> 00:22:07,700
Rym:  Anyway, in some other little news, Disco Elysium, the best single-player game I have played since Breath of the Wild came out, they added something really cool that's just free if you have the game that you didn't even need to pay for.

291
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,255
Rym: It's just there.

292
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,620
Rym: I think they've recognized how much this game resonated.

293
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,320
Scott:  Isn't there some drama with the people who made this game?

294
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,659
Rym:  Oh yeah, the studio collapsed.

295
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,159
Rym: Disco Elysium 2 is definitely not gonna ever get made.

296
00:22:19,864 --> 00:22:21,180
Rym: I don't know who is in the wrong.

297
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:26,639
Rym: It looks like it was over money and corporate structure, and I don't know what happened.

298
00:22:27,962 --> 00:22:41,060
Rym: As best I can tell, there's one group of people who are saying they were harassed out of the company, but there's another group of people saying, actually, our contracts covered this, and also you guys were being weird about dirtbag leftist stuff and harassing people.

299
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:51,600
Scott: So we've got multiple groups accusing each other of harassment, and-- - I just searched for Disco Elysium harassment, and it's like, Disco Elysium writer breakup just got messier.

300
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:54,720
Scott: Disco Elysium creators accused of creating a toxic workplace.

301
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,120
Scott:  Disco Elysium dev says ex-staff were fired over misconduct.

302
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:03,200
Scott: It's like, I don't know what was going on there, but it's clearly something was going on there.

303
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:14,040
Rym:  Kinda like, remember when Magfest had that little blow up, and there was that weird group, the Friends of Magfest, who posted all their extreme diatribes, and I skimmed through it and couldn't fucking tell what anyone was mad about at all?

304
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:19,960
Rym: Same situation, I cannot figure out what actually happened, nor do I care, 'cause the game was fine.

305
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:23,820
Rym: But if you own the game, you can just make collages in it.

306
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:31,339
Rym: They have a mode now where you can take any character, any text, anything in the game, pose everyone, animate 'em however you want, and just make content.

307
00:23:32,084 --> 00:23:34,017
Rym: If you already own the game, you've just got it.

308
00:23:35,421 --> 00:23:38,398
Rym: And I've already seen some fantastic memes with this shit.

309
00:23:41,222 --> 00:23:44,189
Rym: Even the headline here, "Disco Elysium's Collage Mode allows you to write new

310
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:44,697
Rym: dialogue.".

311
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:49,411
Rym: Subtitled, "The update comes amid controversy at the studio that created the

312
00:23:49,452 --> 00:23:49,673
Rym: game.".

313
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:50,939
Scott:  Yep.

314
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:52,839
Rym:  So you got any news?

315
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:55,919
Scott:  Yeah, I do have a news.

316
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,260
Scott: This isn't really a gaming news.

317
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,120
Rym:  But it's a big deal.

318
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:58,799
Rym: We gotta talk about it.

319
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,740
Scott:  It's a really big deal.

320
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,580
Scott: There's a website.

321
00:24:00,781 --> 00:24:04,200
Scott: The website is called DP Review, right?

322
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,780
Scott: Which stands for Digital Photography Review.

323
00:24:07,142 --> 00:24:08,459
Scott: It's dpreview.com.

324
00:24:09,201 --> 00:24:14,100
Scott: I didn't realize that that website, dpreview.com, was bought by Amazon in 2007.

325
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,240
Rym:  Oh, look, capitalism causing every problem.

326
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:18,860
Rym: Every news article we have is bought by capitalism.

327
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:27,000
Scott:  I learned 2007, 2023, 13, 16 years-ish later, I learned that Amazon bought the site, right?

328
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:37,316
Scott: So basically this is a news and review website for digital camera and digital camera accessories that has been around for like almost 30 years.

329
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:47,120
Scott: It is the most comprehensive site for information about digital camera equipment that there probably is, period, right?

330
00:24:47,202 --> 00:24:49,840
Scott: If you're a tech person, you might be thinking about PC gaming.

331
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:53,257
Scott: You're probably thinking about sites like AnandTech or Tom's Hardware, right?

332
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,160
Scott: Or sites of that nature, right?

333
00:24:56,903 --> 00:24:57,959
Scott: And it's been around that long.

334
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:05,539
Scott: And they're unlike other areas of nerdery, like gaming, where there might be multiple sites that were competing with each other all this time.

335
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:10,240
Scott: DP Review is like sorta the only one that was this comprehensive.

336
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,540
Rym:  There's tons of sites that review cameras.

337
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:23,920
Rym: Most of them have either completely facile reviews that don't tell any professional anything they actually need to know, or are increasingly just generated by GPT type algorithms and are just worthless.

338
00:25:24,384 --> 00:25:26,400
Rym: Or they're focused on consumers.

339
00:25:27,061 --> 00:25:31,919
Rym: This was the site that was like, yeah, we tested the sensors on these five cameras in our lab.

340
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:37,658
Scott:  DP Review has a lab where they test lenses and do optical tests and all sorts of things, right?

341
00:25:38,742 --> 00:25:44,700
Scott: And also their website includes like photo samples from all the different camera and lens combinations.

342
00:25:45,161 --> 00:25:46,759
Scott: A lot of users submitted ones.

343
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,919
Scott: It's like, if you wanna know like, well, what do photos look like using this lens on this camera?

344
00:25:52,303 --> 00:25:56,999
Scott: There's probably somebody who took photos with that lens and that camera and uploaded them to the site.

345
00:25:57,802 --> 00:26:03,239
Scott: There's extensive forums answering lots of very specific camera type questions here.

346
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:07,720
Scott: Questions that are not answered anywhere else on the internet, right?

347
00:26:07,901 --> 00:26:14,780
Scott: If you Google search for camera questions, you very often end up in DP Review forum threads frequently.

348
00:26:15,662 --> 00:26:18,500
Scott: They've got a lens like database that you can use.

349
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:28,339
Scott: It's like this cool tool where I've used it often where you choose a camera and then it's like, all right, here's all the lenses that we know of that will work on this camera.

350
00:26:28,481 --> 00:26:32,300
Scott: And then you can sort of filter and browse through them to find a lens that suits your needs.

351
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:35,355
Scott: If like, you know, you need a lens for something and you don't have the right one.

352
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:42,380
Scott: And basically Amazon is not only letting go all the people who work for this place.

353
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:50,757
Rym:  Which I wanna point out, Amazon has announced so many rounds of layoffs and bullshit in the last week that like Amazon's laying fucking everybody off.

354
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,780
Scott:  Yep, so that's the first thing.

355
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,919
Scott: They're shutting down the site.

356
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:59,260
Scott: But after like, they're gonna basically put the site into read only mode in like April something.

357
00:26:59,361 --> 00:27:01,640
Scott: So they're gonna have new content up until April something.

358
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:02,372
Rym:  April 10th.

359
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:06,670
Scott:  Yeah, and then they're getting up until that point, you can put in a request.

360
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:13,279
Scott: if you wanna get your own data, like your own forum posts and your own photos that you submitted, they'll give you a backup of that.

361
00:27:14,203 --> 00:27:15,939
Scott: But you can't, you have to request really soon.

362
00:27:16,682 --> 00:27:20,320
Scott: And then after that, they didn't say how long the site will be in read only mode.

363
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:27,620
Scott: They basically admitted they're gonna just shut that shit down at some point and just turn it off completely, removing it from the internet.

364
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:36,780
Rym:  This is why we can't let companies like Google and Amazon and Microsoft exist at the scale that they exist 'cause they buy good things and then they eventually destroy them.

365
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,021
Scott:  Right, it's like, you can't just, it's like.

366
00:27:39,062 --> 00:27:41,900
Scott: this is a very important resource, right?

367
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:45,320
Scott: It's like, you know, this is like a archive.internetarchiveemergency.

368
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:49,155
Rym:  And before any of you say, well, if it's so valuable, someone else will make one, and guess what?

369
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,480
Rym: Deep View Review probably ain't making enough money.

370
00:27:51,941 --> 00:27:53,099
Rym: Nothing can make enough money.

371
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,080
Scott:  So part of the problems is A, they didn't make any money.

372
00:27:56,161 --> 00:27:57,140
Scott: How would they make money?

373
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:57,413
Scott:  Yeah.

374
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,660
Scott:  It's like, they could only make money from ads.

375
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,960
Scott: There's no other way that this thing makes money, right?

376
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,699
Rym:  Which we'll get back to that.

377
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:10,100
Rym: 'cause based on everything I'm seeing, ads, remember we kept talking about how eventually the ad revenue is gonna happen?

378
00:28:10,542 --> 00:28:12,240
Rym: Ad revenue is cratering, Pete.

379
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,460
Rym: Everything supported by ads is in deep shit.

380
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:17,699
Rym: Twitch is also affected by these layoffs, so watch out.

381
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:25,140
Scott:  It's also expensive to operate this place because not only are you doing journalism, but you're also doing lab testing and that's part of the problem.

382
00:28:25,441 --> 00:28:28,799
Scott: The people are saying they couldn't hire anyone to work in their lab.

383
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,920
Scott: The lab was understaffed, right?

384
00:28:31,221 --> 00:28:34,763
Scott: And they needed people who A, were experts at like.

385
00:28:34,884 --> 00:28:37,300
Scott: optical testing equipment stuff, right?

386
00:28:37,441 --> 00:28:46,699
Rym: It's, you know, very hard to find that kind of person, and B- - I saw the thing as I was reading about this, it said that the kinds of people who know this work almost exclusively live on the East Coast or in LA.

387
00:28:47,501 --> 00:28:50,759
Scott: B, those people need to be in Seattle, where the lab is.

388
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,139
Rym:  Yeah, and Seattle is a very small city.

389
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,279
Rym:  And where Amazon is.

390
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,558
Rym:  Yeah, like Seattle's not big.

391
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:01,800
Scott:  The other thing is that they had, there were these two guys who did video content for them.

392
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,999
Scott: It was very somewhat pretty entertaining and informative YouTube content for camera stuff.

393
00:29:07,222 --> 00:29:11,980
Scott: And those guys used to do that work for the camera store, which is a camera store called the camera store.

394
00:29:12,702 --> 00:29:18,300
Scott: And then they switched over to doing that work for DP review, and now the DP review is shutting down.

395
00:29:18,501 --> 00:29:20,239
Scott: Well, they're getting the boot also.

396
00:29:20,885 --> 00:29:29,840
Scott: So they're basically gonna try, I guess they're gonna go on their own and do their, you know, continue their YouTube content on a different channel, you know, 'cause they're still in the camera circles.

397
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:32,591
Scott: They can still go on doing that, but they're gonna lose.

398
00:29:32,834 --> 00:29:43,360
Scott: those guys who are like somewhat, you know, mid tier, more famous than us, but you know, only famous to camera people, camera test YouTube people, are now only gonna have YouTube revenues.

399
00:29:43,461 --> 00:29:48,296
Scott: They've lost their steady income from Amazon, their regular paycheck, their health insurance.

400
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:55,560
Rym:  YouTube revenues, Patreon revenues, unless you're making furry pornography, that is usually not a lot of money.

401
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:59,520
Scott:  They get a lot of views, you know, basically everyone in the camera scene knows these people.

402
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:04,240
Rym:  Oh yeah, but like million views a month, not a lot of money if you wanna live a normal life.

403
00:30:05,702 --> 00:30:19,980
Rym:  Yep, so this is like a huge, - Also remember views turning into money is done via the same mechanism that was previously funding Amazon keeping this site alive, advertising.

404
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:27,998
Scott:  Yeah, I think these people are probably big enough, the video guys are big enough to get subscriptions and Patreons, but yeah.

405
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,840
Rym:  Which also, that is not a healthy ecosystem.

406
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:41,239
Rym: Like do not think, if we go to a model where every content creator is just directly supported by their fans, that is gonna be a whole other can of worms to deal with down the road.

407
00:30:42,440 --> 00:31:01,420
Scott:  Anyway, this site is a massive, important resource on the internet and for it to go down is like, as big a, you know, it's not a, it's sort of a first world problem, right, situation, but at the other hand, it is a catastrophe, like, you know, not quite Library of Alexandria, but similar kind of deal.

408
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,079
Rym:  All right, here, I got a Scott level idea.

409
00:31:03,441 --> 00:31:06,708
Rym: Instead of my usual like, well, in the Senate, we could whatever, like.

410
00:31:06,748 --> 00:31:07,860
Rym: here's a Scott level idea.

411
00:31:08,561 --> 00:31:35,018
Rym: What if, assuming we've solved other more basic problems like hunger and things in the US to some degree, if we had a government agency, call it, I don't know what to call it, the government reclamation agency, and all they do is if there is a digital resource that the capitalist system fails it in some way and they deem it strategic or valuable to the culture or heritage or professional world of the United

412
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:35,240
Scott: States,

413
00:31:35,623 --> 00:31:35,967
Rym: they would

414
00:31:35,987 --> 00:31:37,140
Scott: take it over and keep it going.

415
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,779
Scott:  We already have a government mechanism for this.

416
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,860
Scott: It's like when they landmark buildings and say, sorry, you own that land, it's privately owned.

417
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:48,999
Scott: You know, the building on it though is a very important and significant landmark.

418
00:31:49,401 --> 00:31:51,700
Scott: So therefore, if you own it, you can't fuck with it.

419
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:59,099
Scott: You have to keep it up, you have to maintain it, you have to do XYZ, you can't smash it, you can't take it down, and if you do, you'll be in deep, deep shit.

420
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,460
Scott:  See, so we should be able to do that to a website.

421
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:07,420
Scott:  We have that legal framework already existing in the US that we should bring it into the digital realm.

422
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:13,860
Scott:  Well, I can't imagine if Amazon-- - Amazon, you bought DP Review, we have deemed that this is too important a resource to the world.

423
00:32:14,201 --> 00:32:19,800
Scott: You cannot take it down, otherwise you will suffer a consequence worse than what it costs you to keep it up.

424
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:30,320
Rym:  Yep, and then if they do try to shut it down anyway, just like how the FDIC just fucking shows up at a bank and takes it over, a bunch of IT people working for the government just show up and take it over.

425
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:41,860
Scott:  We need some sort of way to make a digital place a landmark that will be preserved because it has been deemed significant the same way we do for real buildings and other landmarks.

426
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:47,420
Rym:  But mark my words, and this is my personal-- - Of which this would absolutely qualify, easy, right?

427
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,620
Scott: This would actually be like the example of the thing that qualifies.

428
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:56,040
Rym:  Exactly, but mark my words, and this is my personal opinion, not-- - Our podcast website, not qualified.

429
00:32:56,620 --> 00:33:16,380
Rym:  Not my professional opinion, this is not the opinion of any employer, nor do I have any inside knowledge, this is just purely my personal opinion, I think this and the cratering ad revenue and the layoffs, I think things are looking pretty shitty for the internet and technology before too long.

430
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:20,519
Rym: I think we're gonna see a lot of websites start to disappear in the coming three or four years.

431
00:33:26,211 --> 00:33:29,870
Rym: But anyway, things of the day, what do you got?

432
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:33,770
Scott:  So I don't actually have a link for this, it's just 'cause it's a thing I heard.

433
00:33:34,271 --> 00:33:42,627
Scott: It's sort of a riddle, sort of a math puzzle, but it's not really a math puzzle, 'cause you don't have to do the math to get the answer, you just sort of have to think about it.

434
00:33:43,233 --> 00:33:47,844
Scott: And when I heard it and I read it, it took me a few minutes to understand it and figure it out, and I was like, "Oh, I get

435
00:33:47,884 --> 00:33:47,925
Scott: it.".

436
00:33:48,433 --> 00:33:51,067
Scott: And I was like, "That's interesting enough, "I'll make that a thing of the

437
00:33:51,108 --> 00:33:51,209
Scott: day.".

438
00:33:51,575 --> 00:33:52,590
Scott: So here's the deal, ready?

439
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:57,730
Scott: You got two cars, the cars are driving straight at each other, they're gonna hit--.

440
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:58,309
Rym:  Let's game a chicken.

441
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:04,870
Scott:  Right, they are 100% going to eventually hit head to head, just boom, it's gonna happen, right?

442
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:11,070
Scott: On one of the cars is a bird, a bee, something, or a bee, we'll go with the bee, right?

443
00:34:11,655 --> 00:34:12,487
Scott: It's a magical bee.

444
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:14,882
Rym:  There's a "Star Trek" reference.

445
00:34:14,902 --> 00:34:16,947
Rym: you wouldn't understand, so I won't make it, but anyway.

446
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:18,349
Scott:  Something that flies, right, it's a bee.

447
00:34:19,492 --> 00:34:27,150
Scott: The bee has magical powers, it doesn't have to accelerate, it could just immediately get to speed instantly, right?

448
00:34:27,731 --> 00:34:29,042
Scott: And the bee travels at 100 miles an hour.

449
00:34:30,672 --> 00:34:35,569
Scott: And what the bee is gonna do is it's gonna fly from one car to the other car.

450
00:34:36,092 --> 00:34:43,130
Scott: And then when it reaches the other car, it's gonna turn around and head back to the first car and go back and forth in like a zigzag, right?

451
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:46,929
Scott: But eventually, right, the bee is making shorter and shorter trips each time.

452
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:50,690
Rym:  All right, so this is mathematically identical to the bouncing ball question.

453
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:56,469
Scott:  Right, so it's bouncing back and forth, and eventually when the cars hit each other, the bee will stop 'cause it's in the middle, right?

454
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:58,490
Scott: No more bouncing back and forth between the two cars.

455
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:06,190
Rym:  Theoretically, a uncountably infinite number of back and forths before it fully stops, but physics gets involved at that point.

456
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:08,130
Scott:  We're gonna say it stops when the cars crash.

457
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:11,649
Rym:  Yeah, 'cause physics is beyond the realm of a riddle in that case.

458
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:17,009
Scott:  Yeah, all right, so the cars are 100 miles apart from each other at the start.

459
00:35:18,014 --> 00:35:19,430
Scott: The bee is on one of the cars.

460
00:35:20,232 --> 00:35:23,590
Scott: The bee instantly accelerates to 100 miles an hour, right?

461
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:31,170
Scott: So, and then one car is going 60 miles an hour, and the other car is going 40 miles an hour, right?

462
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:38,550
Scott: The question is, all right, how far does the bee travel in total?

463
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:43,310
Scott: How many miles does the bee travel on its zigzag pattern?

464
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:44,454
Rym:  Ah.

465
00:35:44,474 --> 00:35:45,003
Scott:  Mm.

466
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:47,750
Rym:  It's like a little math puzzle.

467
00:35:48,431 --> 00:35:52,589
Scott:  Yeah, should we, should I say the answer, or should I, I don't know.

468
00:35:53,173 --> 00:35:54,830
Scott: We never did a riddle thing of the day before.

469
00:35:55,290 --> 00:36:00,309
Rym:  I think I would need a, I would need to actually write on a piece of paper to answer that question.

470
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:05,670
Scott:  Well, do you wanna, I mean, I guess the only person that could be spoiled is Rym, I guess, if I say the answer.

471
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:10,150
Rym:  Or how many people are watching the livestream right now?

472
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,810
Rym: We got six people currently watching.

473
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:20,250
Scott:  No, I guess that's, but people could pause, I could say, you know, then try to solve it, and then I could say, they could unpause and hear the answer, or should I not say the answer?

474
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:26,530
Rym:  I'd say after we're done recording the show, say the answer, and I'll put it in the stinger at the end of the episode instead of my usual internet-y bullshit.

475
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:28,729
Rym:  I think that's a good way to go.

476
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:29,620
Scott:  Okay.

477
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:34,987
Rym:  All right, so my thing of the day, we had a little, we celebrated St.

478
00:36:35,027 --> 00:36:51,228
Rym: Patrick's Day by having a small dinner party, and at that party, a friend of ours was, had remembered a melody, and remembered that it was from an old anime, but couldn't remember what the anime is, and we were desperately trying to figure out what anime it was, 'cause we could all kinda remember

479
00:36:51,268 --> 00:36:51,389
Scott: it.

480
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:56,850
Scott:  That's tough, because, you know, you could try to hum to Google or Shazam or whatever, but an anime song, probably not, right?

481
00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:05,030
Rym:  Yep, of course, we all remembered then the moment when you, on GeekNights many years ago, were like, oh, there's this song by Britney Spears or something.

482
00:37:05,551 --> 00:37:13,330
Rym: You'd heard some pop song, but didn't know what it was, and you said the words, it goes (hums) and every listener immediately knew it was toxic.

483
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:14,449
Scott:  Okay.

484
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:15,808
Rym:  But anyway.

485
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:17,090
Scott:  Yeah, that was the song that I had heard.

486
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:31,688
Scott: I remember when I, 'cause I, that was like a, like when I was, when Britney Spears was still a thing and I was in high school, right, the only song of hers I knew was the one I forgot now, but it's Hit Me Baby, Hit Me Baby One More Time,

487
00:37:31,748 --> 00:37:31,949
Rym: obviously.

488
00:37:33,052 --> 00:37:35,470
Scott: Right, and I didn't know the toxic song, right?

489
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:43,750
Scott: But then, many years after Britney Spears was no longer a thing, I heard that song somewhere, with it's, you know, with that, like the violin part.

490
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:49,930
Scott: (hums) Right, and I was like, right, and I was like, oh, that's, I like that part, right?

491
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:52,070
Scott: That was a good part, it was catchy, right?

492
00:37:52,493 --> 00:37:53,923
Scott: But I had no idea at that time.

493
00:37:53,943 --> 00:37:59,370
Scott: it was a Britney Spears song 'cause it felt to me like a brand new song and Britney Spears was not a thing anymore, right?

494
00:37:59,892 --> 00:38:02,388
Scott: And then I found out later, you know, I put everything together, so.

495
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:16,641
Rym:  So, unrelatedly, in, well, semi-relatedly, in 1999, September 12th, 1999, in Tokyo, Masami Okui performed-- - I know that name, but I-- - Yup, the Utena singer.

496
00:38:16,662 --> 00:38:17,670
Scott:  I couldn't tell you who it was.

497
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:19,289
Rym:  So she sang the Utena songs.

498
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:20,127
Scott:  Okay.

499
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:27,689
Rym:  So she performed a live version of Tokini Aiwa at this concert and-- - I know that song.

500
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:39,290
Rym:  In high school, I acquired an MP3, an early MP3, that was a recording of that live concert and it was just in my MP3's directory, like, you know, I collected weird music.

501
00:38:39,431 --> 00:38:40,409
Rym: I had this from high school.

502
00:38:42,013 --> 00:38:51,060
Rym: We were going through my old MP3 directory because it has a lot of anime songs in it because guess who was a fucking giant weeb between 1994 and 2004, like, way more than I am now.

503
00:38:54,613 --> 00:39:01,666
Rym: And I bumped into that MP3 and I promised our friends who didn't know this recording existed, like, oh yeah, after you get home, I'll send you the MP3.

504
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:04,385
Rym: I'll just post it, like, in Discord, like, I'll give it to you.

505
00:39:06,513 --> 00:39:10,370
Rym: I just decided to Google for it 'cause I hadn't thought about this song in a long time.

506
00:39:10,451 --> 00:39:19,750
Rym: and what I found online, my thing of the day, a recording, what looks like an official recording of that exact concert with video and everything just on YouTube.

507
00:39:20,892 --> 00:39:22,063
Rym: It's only got, like, 30,000 views.

508
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:24,344
Rym: I just found it out of nowhere, so.

509
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:26,389
Scott:  That's not 30,000, that's a lot of views.

510
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:28,609
Rym:  Eh, that's a relatively small number of views.

511
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:30,029
Scott:  For something like that?

512
00:39:30,231 --> 00:39:30,498
Scott: Come on.

513
00:39:30,518 --> 00:39:30,806
Scott:  Yeah.

514
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:46,945
Rym: Well, I imagine the only people who have ever found this have been looking for this exact performance from this exact concert and it happened to me, so my thing of the day is Masami Okui, live in Hibiya 13, performing Toki ni Aiwa from Shoujo Kakumei Utena.

515
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:48,006
Scott:  All right.

516
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:53,150
Rym:  In the matter of a moment, the GeekNights Book Club book is The Satanic Versus.

517
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:54,589
Rym: Have you read any words in it yet?

518
00:39:55,390 --> 00:40:00,426
Scott:  No, I'd say I'd read them 'cause we're going to PAX, but we decided to use car to go to PAX and I can't read in a car, so.

519
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:05,270
Rym:  Nope, if I read in a car, it is 30 seconds from feeling fine to a headache that lasts all day.

520
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:06,328
Scott:  That's right.

521
00:40:06,731 --> 00:40:09,350
Scott: Well, my headache doesn't last all day, it just lasts until I stop reading.

522
00:40:09,691 --> 00:40:12,707
Rym: I'd last for a couple hours after I get out of the car once it happens to me.

523
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:18,969
Scott:  Mine just lasts, I just have to close my eyes and stop reading for a little while, I'll be okay, but yeah, I can't read in the car, so.

524
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:35,950
Rym:  But yeah, if so many people have tried to assassinate this author and then you read the first chapter of this and you feel like maybe people trying to assassinate this author does not make sense in light of this is what they're mad about, then yeah, this book is definitely worth reading.

525
00:40:37,412 --> 00:40:43,118
Rym: Also, we will be live a couple days at PAX East 2023 on Thursday, March 23rd at 2.30 p.m.

526
00:40:43,138 --> 00:40:50,964
Rym: Eastern Time in the Bumblebee Theater with Can Competitive and Casual Coexist, a panel.

527
00:40:51,004 --> 00:40:56,988
Rym: we did an early version of once at a magfest a long time ago, and it is updated because we've learned some things.

528
00:40:59,913 --> 00:41:07,322
Rym: Yeah, also, I did a secret panel Scott didn't even know about, it will be live at Zenkai Con at 9 p.m.

529
00:41:07,342 --> 00:41:14,250
Rym: Eastern Time in Zenkai Con Online on Saturday, this coming weekend.

530
00:41:15,072 --> 00:41:23,330
Rym: It is a version of something we talked about doing behind the scenes at conventions, but Scott didn't seem super interested in recording it, so I just recorded it like right after.

531
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:27,889
Scott:  You didn't do any of the work that you didn't do, you just pretended to do it.

532
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:32,170
Rym:  No, so I made a whole slide deck, I put together this intro, but really all it is--.

533
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:33,290
Scott:  But did you actually talk to anybody?

534
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:36,989
Scott:  No, what I did is I outlined-- - That's not the thing I wanted to do.

535
00:41:37,771 --> 00:41:53,429
Rym:  So basically what I did is I outlined in this panel the kinds of roles that exist in conventions that aren't staffed, like contractors versus venue workers and the unions and all those kinds of spaces, but really the end of the panel is just a call to action with a really simple form.

536
00:41:54,111 --> 00:42:02,650
Rym: We wanna hear from people who do all the jobs in, at, and around conventions that are not artist alley and convention staff.

537
00:42:02,771 --> 00:42:10,270
Rym: I wanna hear about the janitor, I wanna hear about the union person who's working the loading dock, I wanna hear from the hotel manager.

538
00:42:11,092 --> 00:42:25,710
Rym: We wanna know about all of you out there, anyone who does work that is adjacent to conventions and hear your story of what it's like to do that kind of work and what it's like to do that kind of work specifically around nerd conventions.

539
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:38,070
Scott:  Yeah, I mean, you basically took, the thing I actually wanted to do was to interview those people, but also the convention staff, also the artists, also the dealers, also not everyone, but attendees.

540
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:42,502
Rym:  I wanna interview everybody, but-- - Exhibitors, vendors, et cetera, food people.

541
00:42:44,971 --> 00:42:50,190
Scott: I wanna interview all the people who are involved in a nerd convention and then put that all together.

542
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:51,790
Rym:  Yeah, make a documentary basically.

543
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:59,345
Scott:  All you did is you said, "Well, instead of actually doing the panel, "I'll make an outline of the panel "and pass that off as my own

544
00:42:59,405 --> 00:42:59,647
Scott: panel.".

545
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:01,890
Rym:  Except I realized something putting it together.

546
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:09,730
Rym: I don't think pretty much anyone attending conventions realizes how venue staffing works and all the temp workers.

547
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:12,250
Scott:  I mean, it's just not something you think about, right?

548
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:20,930
Scott:  People do things in life and most people don't think about the behind the scenes or care about the behind the scenes.

549
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:22,250
Rym:  So it's funny, I did tell one anecdote in it.

550
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:26,244
Rym: 'cause I remember my first nerd convention was Michicon in '94, I wanna say.

551
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:31,030
Scott:  People don't even watch the behind the scenes things when they come on their DVD extras.

552
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:35,898
Rym:  So the first nerd convention I ever went to in '94, I just remember.

553
00:43:35,919 --> 00:43:47,761
Rym: I didn't think, I just went, I didn't barely look to the website, I knew what events I'd signed up for, my dad dropped me off, went in, played some competitive D&D, which sounds weird, but it was the mid '90s, like don't worry about it.

554
00:43:47,781 --> 00:43:48,230
Scott:  I did that one time.

555
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:50,250
Rym:  This was second ed.

556
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:52,809
Rym: But so we're doing that.

557
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:53,570
Scott:  So is mine.

558
00:43:53,890 --> 00:44:10,830
Rym:  I remember at this convention, there was a break in this seven hour game that I was in and I was just sitting there, I was a young kid and was mostly people who were way older than me, but then I saw a little hubbub outside and I realized that there were three people who were talking and they all had little orange armbands on.

559
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:23,750
Rym: I realized later they were convention staff and they were having one of those huddles of nerdy convention staff making a big deal about something that probably isn't a big deal and huffing at each other and like pointing and mumbling and dealing with the situation.

560
00:44:23,932 --> 00:44:28,430
Rym: and at that moment, I thought, wait a minute, how do you get a job running a convention?

561
00:44:28,511 --> 00:44:29,610
Rym: That looks like a great career.

562
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:40,087
Rym: 'cause I was in middle school and then I got really interested in how conventions get run way before I even got into like high school or went to RIT anime or went to like an Otakot or anything.

563
00:44:41,812 --> 00:44:47,990
Rym: So yeah, moral, real arts of all that, if you're a GeekNights listener, just pay attention to how things happen around you.

564
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:49,810
Rym: Don't just walk around, look around.

565
00:44:50,371 --> 00:44:53,570
Rym: Walk around, look around and maybe look behind things occasionally.

566
00:44:55,631 --> 00:44:58,250
Rym: Anyway, other than that, let's get right into the main bit.

567
00:44:58,310 --> 00:45:04,190
Rym: 'cause as always, when we don't do a ton of GeekNights episodes, we go longer and longer and longer when we record shows.

568
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:19,330
Rym: I think Scott briefly talked about playing this game a while ago in like the pre-news part of the GeekNights but we must have talked about it so little, we didn't even type the word Stacklands anywhere on the GeekNights website or in the GeekNights forum.

569
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:22,590
Scott:  Not that I can find but yeah, there's a game called Stacklands.

570
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:26,787
Scott: I got it 'cause it was like on sale or recommended somewhere, it's on my wishlist somehow, I don't know.

571
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:29,160
Rym:  Yep, it came out in 2022 about a year ago.

572
00:45:31,173 --> 00:45:31,668
Rym: It's pretty new.

573
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:37,287
Scott:  Yep, I think it's still, it got an update January 10th so it's still somewhat maintained.

574
00:45:37,388 --> 00:45:39,630
Scott: perhaps or at least recently maintained and updated.

575
00:45:40,752 --> 00:45:42,470
Scott: Is it early access or is it released?

576
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:45,826
Scott: I think maybe it was early access and it got released and that's why I got it.

577
00:45:46,592 --> 00:45:47,610
Scott: Anyway, it doesn't matter.

578
00:45:48,151 --> 00:46:01,790
Scott: What does matter is this game on Steam in terms of recent reviews has 615 overwhelmingly positive reviews and in all of its reviews, all 17,533 reviews are overwhelmingly positive.

579
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:03,500
Scott: That's the biggest, that's like.

580
00:46:03,541 --> 00:46:06,770
Scott: you can't get better on Steam than a rating of overwhelmingly positive.

581
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:14,310
Rym:  Yep, it's also the tip of a little iceberg because it's actually part of the sock pop, S-O-K-P-O-P franchise.

582
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:18,250
Scott:  Yep, it's a dev that sort of branded all their games together.

583
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:20,910
Scott: I played their Simuland game but it's not as good as Stacklands.

584
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:23,289
Rym:  Yeah, from what I've poked at, Stacklands is the best one.

585
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:26,410
Scott:  Yes, so what's Stacklands all about?

586
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:30,170
Scott: Well, it's about stacking cards in the lands, right?

587
00:46:30,631 --> 00:46:36,890
Scott: It's a solo, rogue-like sort of, but it's really hard to lose unless you're bad at it.

588
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:45,070
Rym:  Which is really important because solo, kind of like Slay the Spire, a solo game like that doesn't have to worry about being balanced competitively or any nonsense.

589
00:46:45,434 --> 00:46:46,449
Rym: It just has to be fun.

590
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:52,790
Scott:  Yep, so the way it works is you got all these cards and you're playing with cards on the table, right?

591
00:46:53,474 --> 00:46:54,870
Scott: In front of you, like a solitaire.

592
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:59,690
Scott: And the cards, they sort of do stuff, right?

593
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:01,210
Scott: So some of the cards just sit there.

594
00:47:01,271 --> 00:47:03,050
Scott: Like if you got a rock, it just sits there.

595
00:47:03,251 --> 00:47:04,550
Scott: It's a rock card, right?

596
00:47:04,651 --> 00:47:08,830
Scott: You can stack the rock cards up to make a rock pile but they're still just a bunch of rock cards.

597
00:47:09,411 --> 00:47:11,390
Scott: And then you'll have another card that's like a person.

598
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:13,870
Scott: It's like, okay, I got a person card and a rock card.

599
00:47:14,272 --> 00:47:20,110
Scott: If you stack the person on top of the rock card, the person starts hitting the rock card.

600
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:22,370
Scott: Like ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, right?

601
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:25,050
Scott: And like individual stones come out, right?

602
00:47:25,431 --> 00:47:28,130
Scott: And then it's like, okay, we take a bunch of stones and put them together.

603
00:47:28,692 --> 00:47:32,290
Scott: And then maybe some wood you got from some tree cards, right?

604
00:47:32,371 --> 00:47:37,149
Scott: And then you put a person on that and they'll start taking those and combining them and crafting items.

605
00:47:37,593 --> 00:47:41,149
Scott: They're like weapons and you put, then you give the weapon, equip it on the person.

606
00:47:41,892 --> 00:47:45,869
Rym: And then you put the person on- - And then a little monster might show up and like attack your guys.

607
00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:50,630
Scott:  Right, you put the person on the monster card and the person starts fighting the monster, right?

608
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:56,190
Scott: And it's like, and then the person changes classes to like a knight or a cook or a who knows what, right?

609
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:58,950
Scott: It's like, there's all sorts of different cards.

610
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:04,790
Scott: You know, some of the cards like houses that increase like the limit of how much stuff you can have out on the board.

611
00:48:05,332 --> 00:48:08,450
Scott: Some of them will spit out currencies you can use, right?

612
00:48:08,751 --> 00:48:10,810
Scott: And that's really the key thing is the currency.

613
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:17,370
Scott: When you get coins at the top of the board is basically a card shop where you can buy booster packs.

614
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:20,950
Scott: Like it's fucking, you know, the gaming store is selling you magic boosters.

615
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:23,230
Rym:  Yeah, like in the beginning one, it's called like humble beginnings.

616
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:25,010
Rym: And then, oh, here I got a screenshot.

617
00:48:25,171 --> 00:48:28,069
Rym: And then the next one that costs an extra coin, seeking wisdom.

618
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:28,918
Rym:  Yep.

619
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:31,550
Rym:  It's like different series of cards, like expansion.

620
00:48:31,890 --> 00:48:34,710
Scott:  And different boosters have different kinds of cards in them, right?

621
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:40,668
Scott: So based on like, if you need food, you might buy some, I forget what the name of the set is, but like a booster of the food cards, right?

622
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:45,170
Rym:  And the best part is when you buy a booster, it just barfs the cards in the booster.

623
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:46,029
Rym:  And you're like all over your board.

624
00:48:46,451 --> 00:48:47,189
Rym: And now you got a boomer.

625
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:51,750
Scott:  Well, no, it barfs out a booster pack that you have to open and then the cards come out.

626
00:48:51,910 --> 00:48:54,030
Scott: It's like, you know, as you get the satisfaction of, you know.

627
00:48:54,650 --> 00:49:00,509
Rym:  Everything, all interaction is basically dragging cards around like it's a physical card game, which is a very nice conceit.

628
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:01,530
Scott:  Yep.

629
00:49:02,111 --> 00:49:03,549
Scott: It makes for a good UI also.

630
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:04,087
Scott:  Yeah.

631
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:08,248
Scott:  So you buy boosters to get new kinds of cards you haven't seen.

632
00:49:08,731 --> 00:49:13,609
Scott: Then you get more currency to buy even more expensive boosters with other cards you haven't seen.

633
00:49:14,254 --> 00:49:16,250
Scott: And there's all these quests you're trying to accomplish.

634
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:18,509
Scott: Like there's a huge list of like, do all these things.

635
00:49:19,632 --> 00:49:22,427
Scott: And when you do all those things, eventually you win.

636
00:49:23,953 --> 00:49:24,910
Scott: But you can also lose.

637
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:28,350
Scott: The way you lose is that you need food, right?

638
00:49:28,911 --> 00:49:38,170
Scott: Even, you know, it's like, it would be too easy if you could just, you know, do all your crafting and, you know, equip all your guys and get all the currency and buy the best stuff.

639
00:49:38,691 --> 00:49:52,109
Scott: You have to also make sure you are making enough food and every once in a while, the timer runs out and all the people that you have on the board, right, are gonna eat their, however much food they wanna eat 'cause they're hungry.

640
00:49:52,370 --> 00:49:54,670
Rym:  And if you don't have enough food, well, there is a corpse card.

641
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:55,748
Rym: You might see a bunch of them.

642
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:57,470
Scott:  Right, it's people.

643
00:49:57,590 --> 00:50:05,329
Scott: And if you run out of people, then you can't get anything done 'cause pretty much making anything happen, almost anything happen requires a people to do the work.

644
00:50:06,152 --> 00:50:09,010
Scott: Some things you can do without a people, but most things need a people.

645
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:12,790
Scott: So if all the people die of starvation, you're in trouble.

646
00:50:12,952 --> 00:50:18,469
Scott: And it's like this balancing act because to make more food, you need more people, but more people need more food.

647
00:50:19,493 --> 00:50:21,130
Rym:  Yeah, so you gotta start to be efficient.

648
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:29,009
Rym: Like a lot of engine building type games early on, like, all right, I got berry bushes, I'll keep planting those, I'll have villagers picking berries, like that'll work out.

649
00:50:29,333 --> 00:50:30,850
Rym: But then you gotta scale it up.

650
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:33,090
Rym: You gotta scale up your whole pipeline.

651
00:50:33,232 --> 00:50:38,030
Rym: It's almost like you're making one of those victory point machines in a German board game.

652
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:49,910
Scott:  Yep, and it's like, oh, okay, well, I'll just have, if one person can pick enough berries for three people or two people or whatever it is, I'll just have half my people picking berries and half the people doing something else.

653
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:51,965
Scott: But picking berries is a lot of clicking.

654
00:50:52,026 --> 00:50:54,489
Scott: for you to get more berry bushes all the time.

655
00:50:54,914 --> 00:51:00,389
Scott: And also to have that many people, you need a bunch more shelter cards to provide housing for all those people.

656
00:51:00,733 --> 00:51:02,390
Scott: 'cause it's a people limit, right?

657
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:05,570
Scott: And then can you, it's like, it's not gonna scale.

658
00:51:05,931 --> 00:51:06,799
Scott: You need to eventually-.

659
00:51:06,819 --> 00:51:08,809
Rym:  And you gotta get more and more cards out.

660
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:09,970
Rym: They start getting in the way.

661
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:13,328
Rym: You're trying to move your shit around just to make a space to do a thing you wanna do.

662
00:51:14,190 --> 00:51:22,222
Scott:  Yeah, you eventually need to get cows in a farm and then process the milk and make recipes in your cookhouse to get food.

663
00:51:23,470 --> 00:51:28,288
Scott: And it's like, if you can make really good food, it's like, well, that food, that one steak can feed three people, right?

664
00:51:28,570 --> 00:51:31,210
Rym:  And there's a lot going on.

665
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:35,590
Rym: If you start to play this, it seems really simple and almost easy because it's teaching you how to play.

666
00:51:36,072 --> 00:51:44,609
Rym: The complexity actually ramps up pretty fast in a satisfying way, but it never sort of ramps up in a way that feels unmanageable.

667
00:51:45,671 --> 00:51:47,569
Scott:  Yep, it's like, there's a lot of funny things too.

668
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:53,987
Scott: Like there's a, you'll get like, you know, like bad guys will run around messing up your cards if you don't fight them.

669
00:51:55,172 --> 00:51:57,627
Scott: A dark portal to another world opens up.

670
00:51:58,993 --> 00:52:01,050
Scott: You get, you know, you travel to like an island.

671
00:52:01,613 --> 00:52:05,028
Scott: It's like another place where you can do stuff with a boat back and forth.

672
00:52:05,391 --> 00:52:12,829
Scott: And it's like all, you know, you go on adventures, you can, they'll be like, you'll get a purple card that'll be like the mountains and you put a person on it.

673
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:18,210
Scott: That person will go questing in the mountains and basically they'll sit on the card.

674
00:52:18,693 --> 00:52:26,489
Scott: And when the progress bar on the mountains fills up, something will pop out and it'll might be, you know, I don't know, a berry tree from the mountains.

675
00:52:27,112 --> 00:52:34,770
Scott: It might be, I don't know, some gems that they found in a mine on the mountains, or it might be a troll that lives in the mountains, right?

676
00:52:35,112 --> 00:52:42,690
Scott: You know, you send, and then suddenly everyone has to stop what they're doing and fight this troll, otherwise it's gonna mess you up and eat all your food or who knows what it's gonna do.

677
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:48,128
Rym:  Yeah, I sent a villager to a graveyard 'cause I was like, ooh, I can get some good stuff out there and they found a corpse, like, okay, great, thank you.

678
00:52:49,151 --> 00:52:49,989
Rym: I don't know what I expected.

679
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:52,769
Scott:  Sometimes you need corpses to do things.

680
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:54,989
Rym:  Yup, and there's a lot of ways to make corpses.

681
00:52:55,990 --> 00:53:02,590
Scott:  But it's interesting 'cause like you don't know from the start like what cards do what, or like what the recipes are for cards.

682
00:53:02,892 --> 00:53:21,609
Scott: You can sort of see them in the little list there, but it's like you figure them out as you go along, you unlock new recipes and it's like, oh, I can combine three steel and a thing to make a sword, or I can combine these things, you know, get some magic dust and I can make a fucking, you know, crazy powerful mage staff or whatever.

683
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:23,556
Scott: You level your shit up.

684
00:53:23,576 --> 00:53:24,749
Scott:  There's a lot you can do.

685
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:28,777
Rym: Like I just found the list to be, there are 353 unique cards in this game.

686
00:53:32,570 --> 00:53:37,990
Scott:  It seems like it's a lot, but it's like, I actually, you know, I beat, how much hours did I play this game on Steam?

687
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:38,586
Scott: Let's see.

688
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:41,296
Rym:  Let's see, there are 60--.

689
00:53:41,316 --> 00:53:49,830
Scott:  I played it 10 hours and I completed, I don't know if I got every single card there is to get or did everything there is to do.

690
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:53,449
Rym:  We did a show a long time ago on 100% in games, now it's usually not worth it.

691
00:53:53,930 --> 00:54:00,790
Scott:  But I completed 34 out of 36 achievements and I beat the game, I beat it, right?

692
00:54:00,830 --> 00:54:02,629
Scott: The ending ending was achieved.

693
00:54:02,629 --> 00:54:06,830
Scott: 10 hours, 10 hours well spent for this clever game.

694
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:08,710
Rym:  This game is worth 10 hours to play.

695
00:54:09,130 --> 00:54:12,170
Scott:  If it was more than 10 hours, I might be like, that's too many hours.

696
00:54:12,190 --> 00:54:24,330
Rym:  I feel like I would have petered out if it went too much longer, but it ends, it feels really satisfying as you get toward the end, like things start to click together, you start to get into a groove, you start to figure out how to manage your cards.

697
00:54:24,692 --> 00:54:38,269
Rym: It just does a really good job of gently guiding you toward figuring things out, but not telling you exactly what everything does, like things work kind of intuitively, but occasionally you'll make some cards up and they'll do something you didn't expect and that's usually delightful.

698
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:42,889
Scott:  It's also worth noting, I only spent like five bucks at most for this game, right?

699
00:54:43,651 --> 00:54:47,608
Scott: Right now on Steam, this game is $3 and 50 cents 'cause it's on sale.

700
00:54:47,971 --> 00:54:50,009
Rym:  No, that rounds down to zero.

701
00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:57,488
Scott:  Right, of course, make sure you gotta follow the Scott policy, only buy it if you are going to immediately install and play it.

702
00:54:57,670 --> 00:55:03,410
Rym:  That is what I did, after Scott mentioned it a while ago, right after the show, I bought it, I played it immediately and it was great.

703
00:55:04,492 --> 00:55:11,090
Scott:  They are also selling, it seems, a strategy bundle of other similar games.

704
00:55:11,613 --> 00:55:12,580
Scott: that is $9 and 23 cents.

705
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:19,850
Scott: And they have a, oh, you know what?

706
00:55:19,970 --> 00:55:21,070
Scott: You know how I got this game?

707
00:55:21,170 --> 00:55:25,150
Scott: I think I bought a card-based village builders bundle.

708
00:55:25,291 --> 00:55:27,088
Scott: that was two games, that's how I got it.

709
00:55:27,850 --> 00:55:30,453
Rym:  Well, they got a mega collection of 100 games for $111.

710
00:55:30,453 --> 00:55:35,448
Scott:  They have a mega collection of 100 sock pop super bundle, right?

711
00:55:36,351 --> 00:55:37,275
Scott: And it is $110, but it's like 100 games.

712
00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:41,582
Scott: So it's like $1.10 per game.

713
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:50,650
Rym:  Now at the same time, I wanna point out that the other than Counter-Strike, the first thing I ever bought on Steam was a-- - It game super bundle?

714
00:55:50,910 --> 00:55:52,349
Rym:  Yeah, I have every game in there.

715
00:55:53,352 --> 00:55:55,670
Scott:  Every Doom, every Quake, at the time at least.

716
00:55:55,830 --> 00:56:01,180
Rym:  Yup, I have not at any point installed or launched at least half of those, ever.

717
00:56:02,470 --> 00:56:04,110
Scott:  I've played a lot of them, at least a little bit.

718
00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:05,484
Rym:  Not all of them though, not 100% of them.

719
00:56:07,410 --> 00:56:08,529
Scott:  Definitely not all, 'cause there's a lot.

720
00:56:08,690 --> 00:56:12,229
Rym:  We should play some Quake 1 because they added CTF and we haven't even touched it yet.

721
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:16,166
Scott:  I remember when they did add it, I suggested we do it and no one did.

722
00:56:16,570 --> 00:56:20,250
Rym:  I wanted to too, but we wanted a critical mass, you and I were the only ones who were willing.

723
00:56:20,918 --> 00:56:21,210
Rym:  Right.

724
00:56:21,530 --> 00:56:22,390
Rym:  I think we can make it happen.

725
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:37,489
Scott:  But yeah, I highly recommend the overwhelmingly positively reviewed $3.50 10 hour game stack lands if you like a solo, roguelike little, I don't know if it's puzzle-y, but like a little crafty--.

726
00:56:37,590 --> 00:56:42,875
Rym:  It's a little puzzle-y, but it's more like, but they're like broad puzzles, it's more like.

727
00:56:43,278 --> 00:56:49,389
Rym: how do I forge a path through crafting in these cards to continue to progress and see more cards?

728
00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:53,969
Scott:  And eventually you see the final cards and then you win the end.

729
00:56:54,470 --> 00:56:56,790
Rym:  And every time you find a new card, it's satisfying.

730
00:56:57,493 --> 00:56:59,464
Rym: I never saw a card I hadn't seen before and said, "That's

731
00:56:59,546 --> 00:56:59,586
Rym: it?".

732
00:56:59,972 --> 00:57:01,730
Rym: It was always either funny or useful.

733
00:57:03,172 --> 00:57:10,070
Scott:  Or if you just keep getting cards you already don't need, you can just sell them and turn them into coins to buy boosters to try to find the card you--.

734
00:57:10,070 --> 00:57:24,909
Rym:  I remember I hit a moment where I started, I had way too much clutter and I was like, "Oh fuck," and then a bear was running around and I was having trouble dealing with the bear, so I was consolidating cards, trying to sell a bunch just to make space 'til I cleaned up my biz to get a guy with a sword to go deal with that bear.

735
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:39,629
Scott:  Yeah, I remember I had livestock that I was using for food, which was giving me a good return on food, keeping the game going, but the livestock were just running all over the place and I didn't yet have the technology of a barn to put them in from running around.

736
00:57:40,831 --> 00:57:42,244
Scott: When I got the barn, I was like, "Yes,

737
00:57:42,264 --> 00:57:42,809
Scott: finally!".

738
00:57:42,970 --> 00:57:47,068
Scott: I shoved all the cows and chickens in the barn, and then I was like, "Okay, you all stay put,".

739
00:57:47,371 --> 00:57:49,980
Scott: and then the eggs and the milk started popping out of the barn, and I'm like,

740
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:50,163
Scott: "Good.".

741
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:58,400
Rym:  This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

742
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:03,540
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

743
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:08,900
Scott:  Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

744
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:16,538
Rym:  Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows, Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

746
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:27,580
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience, but unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

747
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:49,519
Rym:  And the Patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights are Alan Joyce, Linki G, Dredd, Lily Tenebra, Case Care, Makes Music, Chris and Todd Clinton, Walton, Dex, Finn, Joel Hayes, Penny Reimer, Rebecca Dunn, Sam Erickson, Shervin Von Hurl, and a bunch of people who are giving us like a dollar instead of hitting that ridiculous and arbitrary $5 threshold for us to say your name.

748
00:58:50,921 --> 00:58:59,359
Rym: Yeah, we said in the show that I would just have a recording of Scott giving the answer to that riddle, and we both promptly forgot about it.

749
00:58:59,961 --> 00:59:00,578
Rym: Hockey game's on.

750
00:59:00,861 --> 00:59:05,260
Rym: I'm recording this between the first and the second period, so I don't know the answer to the riddle.

751
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:07,914
Rym: I'm not gonna bother Scott, and I'm just gonna end the show right now with...

752
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:10,019
Scott:  The beat, it's a good beat.

753
00:59:10,501 --> 00:59:11,210
Scott: I can move to it.

754
00:59:20,010 --> 00:59:21,930
Rym:  Mama's getting her little shoulder thing going.

755
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:23,450
Scott:  It's nice.

756
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:25,730
Scott: Hey, back me up, everybody.

757
00:59:26,471 --> 00:59:30,010
Scott: Bim bam, lingy lingy, bim bam, lingy lingy, bim bam.

758
00:59:30,371 --> 00:59:34,130
Rym: Bim bam, a-lingy lingy, bim bam, lingy lingy, bim bam.

759
00:59:34,450 --> 00:59:38,290
Rym: Bim bam, a-lingy lingy, bim bam, lingy lingy, bim bam.

760
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:42,409
Scott: Bim bam, a-lingy lingy, bim bam, lingy lingy, bim bam.

761
00:59:42,770 --> 00:59:46,589
Rym: Bim bam, a-lingy lingy, bim bam, lingy lingy, bim bam.

762
00:59:47,230 --> 00:59:50,810
Rym:  Okay, friends, hi, back on task here.

763
00:59:51,055 --> 00:59:51,870
Rym: We're talking about holes.
