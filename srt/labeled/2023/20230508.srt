1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:09,738
Rym: It's Monday, May 8th, 2023.

2
00:00:09,738 --> 00:00:10,040
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:13,050
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:14,294
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,334 --> 00:00:18,830
Rym: Tonight we're talking about the noise that comes out of technology like computers.

6
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:20,688
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:21,591 --> 00:00:23,589
Rym: So, this past weekend, you know what I did?

8
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:28,850
Rym: Went to a Star Trek convention, which is not something, you know, I like Star Trek a lot.

9
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:30,499
Rym: And I like conventions a lot.

10
00:00:30,861 --> 00:00:33,209
Scott: But anyone who's listened to GeekNights- I like one of those things.

11
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:47,370
Rym: Anyone who's listened to GeekNights for more than, like, a few minutes knows that when I- when me or Scott say we like conventions, what we're actually saying is we like PAXes, Megfests, and a handful of other specific named conventions.

12
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:59,130
Rym: Uh, most conventions that are not PAXes and Megfests and things like that, and, like, a lot of anime cons, have bad weird formats, they make you pay for events, like, there's all sorts of nonsense going on.

13
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:06,770
Scott: Yeah, the majority of conventions out there, especially smaller ones, are pretty much, like, just a room full of, you know, tables, right?

14
00:01:07,152 --> 00:01:08,538
Scott: Which is perfectly fine.

15
00:01:08,619 --> 00:01:15,830
Scott: if your event is, say, the Mocha Festival, where it's, like, that's all you, you know- Or if your event is that thing in Wildwood where it's just a hyped-up garage sale.

16
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,781
Scott: Well, but that's not a good event.

17
00:01:18,801 --> 00:01:20,170
Scott: That's exactly a bad convention.

18
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:25,430
Rym: Well, yeah, I guess it's, you know, it sucks because that type of event- That's more like a collectible show than a convention.

19
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:30,489
Rym: Well, like, Philly Wizard World is very good for the kind of person who wants to go to Philly Wizard World.

20
00:01:31,371 --> 00:01:36,850
Scott: Right, but a lot of conventions out there, if they have panels, they're real weak sauce, right?

21
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:41,406
Scott: There's no content beyond shopping or whatnot, right?

22
00:01:43,271 --> 00:01:51,410
Scott: So, you know, and the thing is, you know, the Star Trek con is pretty much- That's, like, I don't know if the first- I don't think the first con was a Star Trek con, right?

23
00:01:51,651 --> 00:01:55,770
Rym: Star Trek cons were, like, some of the first cons that we would recognize.

24
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:03,010
Scott: But I do credit the Star Trek fandom with making nerd cons into a thing, right?

25
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:11,988
Scott: You know, when nerd cons entered into the consciousness of, you know, nerd or the rest of, you know, the culture, right?

26
00:02:12,551 --> 00:02:18,510
Scott: It was the Star Trek cons that were the ones that were, you know, making the biggest waves in that regard.

27
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:22,690
Rym: Like, you can probably thank Star Trek cons for, like, panels.

28
00:02:23,553 --> 00:02:25,890
Rym: Like, those cons don't have panels even today.

29
00:02:26,153 --> 00:02:27,550
Rym: That's a weird thing to most people.

30
00:02:28,612 --> 00:02:34,170
Scott: No, but, you know, it was Star Trek cons that were the ones that were parodied on television and, you know, on sitcoms.

31
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:37,349
Scott: They would always be a Star Trek con episode or something like that, right?

32
00:02:38,974 --> 00:02:40,650
Scott: Or a comic con, maybe, sometimes.

33
00:02:40,772 --> 00:02:41,949
Scott: But usually a Star Trek one.

34
00:02:42,551 --> 00:02:43,690
Scott: And, you know, the cosplaying.

35
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:46,610
Scott: I guess, you know, there were cosplays before Star Trek, right?

36
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:53,810
Scott: But those people really went in on it with their, you know, their Starfleet uniforms and the little badges that go beep-beep and whatnot.

37
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,530
Scott: So, their Spock ears, right?

38
00:02:56,891 --> 00:02:59,470
Scott: So, you know, credit where credit is due.

39
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:04,270
Scott: But a Star Trek con is, you know, even if I like Star Trek, right?

40
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:05,609
Scott: Which I don't.

41
00:03:06,231 --> 00:03:09,909
Scott: But if I did, a Star Trek con would still not be appealing to me.

42
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:11,370
Rym: Yeah, well, we had a good time.

43
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,710
Scott: I'm not gonna spend-- Because those are historically the not good kind of convention.

44
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:15,841
Rym: But we had a good time.

45
00:03:16,451 --> 00:03:26,790
Rym: But I'm not gonna-- I won't belabor, like, a big review of the con or anything, but I want to get a point out is that they had a panel format for when they had a panel with some guests on it that I had never seen before.

46
00:03:27,732 --> 00:03:30,130
Rym: And I think this could be used at other cons.

47
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:33,970
Rym: Like, if we were still running panel, like, that entire content floor--.

48
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:34,589
Scott: So, what was the format?

49
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,990
Rym: So, at Kinetic Con, I would probably implement this.

50
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:49,650
Rym: The format was, instead of just having all the guests on stage, and then they answer questions or tell anecdotes or whatever, they would introduce all the guests, but the panel room is broken up into, like, six circles of chairs.

51
00:03:50,511 --> 00:04:03,188
Rym: And each guest would go to one of those circles and just have a conversation with that smaller group of people for ten minutes, and then all the guests would rotate which circle they were in.

52
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:11,910
Rym: So, you got, like, just have a conversation among a relatively small group of people, like, small enough to where you can actually kind of have a conversation.

53
00:04:12,891 --> 00:04:14,110
Scott: But only a ten-minute conversation.

54
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:14,300
Rym: Yeah.

55
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:18,470
Scott: But as a result-- So, if there's a horrible nerd, they get to escape them within ten minutes.

56
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:18,779
Scott: Yep.

57
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:22,510
Rym: But also, obviously, I would modify this format a little bit.

58
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:28,410
Rym: Like, I'd have, of course, a staffer, like, standing in each one to mitigate the nerd if they're there.

59
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:29,349
Rym: You know, that kind of thing.

60
00:04:30,233 --> 00:04:36,170
Rym: But what was interesting is that what ended up happening, like, by observation, is that-- Did you go to any of these circles?

61
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:39,670
Rym: Oh, yeah, I sat in one of the circles and met, like, a bunch of Star Trek people.

62
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:40,863
Scott: With what famous person?

63
00:04:40,884 --> 00:04:41,370
Scott: that I don't know?

64
00:04:41,732 --> 00:04:43,490
Rym: The guy who played Gowron in Star Trek.

65
00:04:43,711 --> 00:04:44,708
Rym: The guy who is-- Oh, really?

66
00:04:44,872 --> 00:04:44,961
Scott: Yeah.

67
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,767
Scott: The guy we-- The eyeball guy?

68
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:55,904
Rym: Yeah, and in fact, the first question a nerd asks while we're hanging out, 'cause one, this guy's really funny, and he was like, "So, uh, why did you do the eyes like that?

69
00:04:55,964 --> 00:04:57,669
Rym: Like, what's the real story behind the

70
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:57,910
Rym: eyes?".

71
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,422
Rym: He's like, "Oh, it's actually better than you think.

72
00:05:00,463 --> 00:05:01,588
Rym: You want to hear the story about the

73
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:01,910
Rym: eyes?".

74
00:05:02,393 --> 00:05:04,970
Rym: And he told the story about the fucking eyes, and it was really good.

75
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,689
Scott: He probably tells that story, like, a hundred times.

76
00:05:07,096 --> 00:05:07,210
Rym: Yep.

77
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:12,610
Rym: But, uh, we met the guy who played Martok, another one of the Klingon Chancellors.

78
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,869
Rym: The guy who played the Doctor in Deep Space Nine.

79
00:05:15,872 --> 00:05:16,449
Scott: Don't know that one.

80
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:19,510
Rym: The woman who played Jadzia Dagg-- You're not gonna know any of these people.

81
00:05:20,155 --> 00:05:20,200
Scott: No.

82
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,150
Scott: I knew the Gauran guy.

83
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,618
Rym: Yeah, you know the Gauran guy.

84
00:05:23,638 --> 00:05:25,249
Rym: You can see him right now, most likely.

85
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:28,306
Scott: There's also the anti-Semitic Jewish bartender guy.

86
00:05:28,427 --> 00:05:28,930
Scott: I know that guy.

87
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,008
Rym: Armand Shimmerman, Quark.

88
00:05:30,693 --> 00:05:31,989
Scott: Reading Rainbow eyeball guy.

89
00:05:32,451 --> 00:05:33,448
Rym: Uh, Geordi, that's from TNG.

90
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:39,614
Scott: Obviously, I know, you know, the two-- The coolest one was not a visitor.

91
00:05:39,955 --> 00:05:47,707
Rym: She played the major on DS9, but the thing that was really interesting-- If you say the major, I only think about-- I know you do.

92
00:05:48,111 --> 00:05:52,650
Rym: They're, in some ways, similar characters who kick similar amounts of ass.

93
00:05:53,671 --> 00:05:54,170
Scott: The cyborg guy.

94
00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:08,970
Rym: But what happened was that you get a little more back and forth, and you have conversations, which I think is better because, frankly, pure anecdotes from nerd celebrities are all documented in detail by nerds on the internet.

95
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:12,310
Rym: Like, the nature of the kind of person will ask that question at a con.

96
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:17,790
Rym: That person has seen the ten times that guest gave that answer already before they even got to them.

97
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,349
Scott: That person has just never read the internet.

98
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:20,290
Rym: Ah, depends.

99
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:25,150
Rym: It is shocking how few people read the internet, but people at this con seem to mostly have read the internet.

100
00:06:25,851 --> 00:06:34,769
Rym: But also, these guests were way more willing to get more personal in this smaller setting and, like, answer more personal questions in a pretty good way.

101
00:06:35,591 --> 00:06:50,209
Rym: And it was just, it was interesting that as an ostensible expert in, like, the running of nerd conventions, I had never seen this format before, and having seen it run, it is a pretty good format that I would institute if I was ever in this position again.

102
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:58,148
Scott: I mean, I've used that, I've used and participated in that format, but not when it came to celebrities at any level, right?

103
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:06,009
Scott: I've used it for, like, you know, alright, you know, educational settings, or teamwork-y settings, or...

104
00:07:06,651 --> 00:07:07,443
Rym: And that's, that's it.

105
00:07:07,463 --> 00:07:07,930
Scott: That's the secret.

106
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:17,230
Scott: Conference-y settings where everyone is mostly on the same level, or there might be, like, one leader at each station or something like that, but never was it for celebrity purposes.

107
00:07:17,811 --> 00:07:25,130
Rym: Yup, so, I guess what I'll end on here, and then we'll get into the actual news, the benefits of this were twofold, and one of them's primarily for the guests themselves.

108
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:29,870
Rym: I think these guests had a way better time doing this than doing regular panels.

109
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:33,570
Scott: Like, they seemed- Well, it's less prep- you don't have to prepare anything.

110
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:34,011
Rym: Yup.

111
00:07:34,171 --> 00:07:39,730
Rym: But also, they got, like, some of them just, like, asked us questions the whole time, which was actually really kind of funny.

112
00:07:40,591 --> 00:07:41,938
Rym: Like, what were they interested in?

113
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:43,265
Rym: They're like, "Why are you into Star Trek?

114
00:07:43,627 --> 00:07:44,029
Rym: Like, what's your

115
00:07:44,049 --> 00:07:44,210
Rym: deal?".

116
00:07:44,532 --> 00:07:46,830
Rym: And it was actually weirdly interesting.

117
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:53,650
Rym: So, I think it's better for the guests, especially the kind of guest who, like, goes to a million cons and maybe is sick of going to cons.

118
00:07:54,690 --> 00:08:06,370
Scott: The thing about that, the thing about that, right, is, like, uh, you know, if this, you know, when the celebrity's asking you stuff, it's like, that's good because you're getting away from them telling those same stories over and over again.

119
00:08:06,533 --> 00:08:06,603
Scott: Yup.

120
00:08:06,832 --> 00:08:07,070
Scott: Right?

121
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:11,089
Rym: The danger is you get to hear the worst guy in that circle just tell-.

122
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,474
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

123
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:15,163
Scott: It's more enjoyable for the celebrity, right?

124
00:08:15,183 --> 00:08:17,070
Scott: 'Cause they're hearing something new, right?

125
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:23,910
Scott: They're asking, presumably, 'cause they genuinely want to ask and then, you know, or they just want to not have to be the one who talks, right?

126
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,341
Scott: It's a way for them to, right?

127
00:08:25,362 --> 00:08:26,229
Scott: It's a tool for them.

128
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:29,757
Scott: And also, I definitely would want to be asked, right?

129
00:08:29,817 --> 00:08:35,510
Scott: It's like, if someone I cared about, you know, comes and asks me, like, you know, that would be the greatest.

130
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:38,461
Scott: Like, if, I don't know, Urasawa's like, "Hey, why do you like my

131
00:08:38,522 --> 00:08:38,903
Scott: manga?".

132
00:08:38,923 --> 00:08:40,308
Scott: I'd be like, "Oh, let me tell

133
00:08:40,328 --> 00:08:40,390
Scott: you.".

134
00:08:40,631 --> 00:08:45,565
Rym: It's like, alright, you're- I'd have to preface that by saying, "So I'm just gonna keep talking until you cut me off.

135
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:46,749
Rym: Feel free to cut me off,

136
00:08:46,789 --> 00:08:47,029
Rym: buddy.".

137
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:47,631
Rym: Right.

138
00:08:48,292 --> 00:08:55,870
Scott: But, if there's another Scott and Urasawa asked that other Scott that question, that is the worst for me.

139
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:56,270
Scott: Yup.

140
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:00,786
Scott: Listen, I don't give a shit about some stranger and why they like the same celebrity I do.

141
00:09:00,866 --> 00:09:01,147
Scott: That's awful.

142
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:07,710
Rym: They ended up asking questions that had relatively short answers, but nobody went on too long.

143
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:25,549
Rym: And I think, I suspect, the people who are the most damaging and dangerous in traditional panel Q&A are terrified of speaking up and trying to ask a question in a small group setting where there isn't a microphone that says, "You are the one who gets to ask a

144
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:25,910
Rym: question.".

145
00:09:26,391 --> 00:09:32,950
Rym: Like, there were no "that guy" questions that I observed, and I cannot believe that was true.

146
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:34,290
Scott: That's true.

147
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,231
Rym: I need more data!

148
00:09:35,692 --> 00:09:36,432
Rym: I have a datum!

149
00:09:36,773 --> 00:09:50,350
Rym: I have one convention where I saw this format, but the fact that 0% of the questions at a fucking Star Trek con were "that guy" in this format is a piece of data that needs to be looked into a little bit further.

150
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,051
Scott: That is true.

151
00:09:52,072 --> 00:10:12,930
Scott: It takes less, you know, a shy person, right, would, you know, could be empowered and sort of, you know, the sea of faces, right, it's easy to talk into a microphone and it's like, you know, but it's like if you're in a small, intimate setting, then if you're that kind of person, it may be much more difficult to say anything.

152
00:10:13,843 --> 00:10:13,968
Rym: Yup.

153
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:19,430
Scott: 'Cause it's no longer a sea of faces, like it's individual people that you're seeing, right?

154
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:28,170
Rym: So, jumping into some news, this is fine, looks like it's finally for real, you can do it now, like it was announced a while ago, but it's here.

155
00:10:28,931 --> 00:10:32,410
Rym: You can now use passkeys to sign into your Google account.

156
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:38,186
Scott: Yup, so, I think we did a multi-factor authentication episode last year, or 2021, somewhat recently.

157
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:40,547
Rym: I'll find it and link to it.

158
00:10:41,451 --> 00:10:49,769
Scott: But yeah, passkeys are a thing, they're just, you know, there's a sea of acronyms that are, you know, involved with FIDO and, you know, TOTP.

159
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:58,590
Rym: Yeah, and I'll get, you know, as a technology professional, where part of that is my job, for real, even right now, I don't even know all those acronyms, like it's like-.

160
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:01,269
Scott: Oh, well, I can explain passkey to you very simply, right?

161
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:07,210
Scott: Here's how passkey works, it's really a great, it's a great idea, it's not perfect, but it's pretty, it's gonna make things a lot better.

162
00:11:07,311 --> 00:11:08,410
Scott: It's better than typing a password.

163
00:11:08,873 --> 00:11:11,450
Scott: It's a lot better than passwords for everybody, right?

164
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:15,890
Scott: So, the way it works is, you have some sort of private key, right?

165
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:19,006
Scott: And the private key is generated, right?

166
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,630
Scott: Presumably, uniquely, right?

167
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:30,010
Scott: It could be uniquely or not, but it doesn't matter, but for the websites that you're gonna log into, right?

168
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,099
Scott: Things you're gonna log into.

169
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:43,350
Scott: And, basically, they send you, you know, you got a public key, and you give the public key over to, you know, whoever it is that you're gonna log into, right?

170
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:51,610
Scott: And then, now that they have your public key, you can prove to them that you have the private key that goes with that public key, right?

171
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,905
Scott: So, Google says, "Hey, Scott, yeah, give me a public key.

172
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:55,930
Scott: Here, here, here's one.

173
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,642
Scott: Alright, now, here's some data that's random.

174
00:11:58,703 --> 00:12:00,050
Scott: Encrypt it with your private key.

175
00:12:00,311 --> 00:12:01,177
Scott: Okay, I'll encrypt it.

176
00:12:01,237 --> 00:12:01,600
Scott: Here you go.

177
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,344
Scott: Here's the encrypted

178
00:12:02,365 --> 00:12:02,646
Scott: data.".

179
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:19,170
Scott: And then, they, you know, check it with the public key, and they go, "Yup, it's mathematically impossible for the person, right, who encrypted that data, right, to not have the private key that went with the public key.

180
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:25,070
Scott: Therefore, we know that that person who gave us the public key is the same person who encrypted this data, right?

181
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:27,010
Scott: 100% mathematically proven.

182
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:31,376
Scott: Therefore, you go to a website, and it says, "Hey, register with our website.

183
00:12:31,656 --> 00:12:41,410
Scott: Tell us your username, and, you know, do your Apple Touch ID, or do your Windows Hello, or do your YubiKey, or do your whatever.

184
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:46,930
Scott: Do your thing that your device does that has a private key in it, right?

185
00:12:47,591 --> 00:12:56,650
Scott: And that will, behind the scenes, prove to us, right, that there, you know, there's a, we'll get, we'll receive a public key, and we'll know that you go with it.

186
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:03,303
Scott: And then, from that point forward, right, the next time, the first time, you could send anything.

187
00:13:03,723 --> 00:13:07,010
Scott: It's like, you could use whatever, right, because it's the first time you're registering.

188
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:13,470
Scott: But after that, they call it a ceremony, after you perform the registration ceremony, right?

189
00:13:14,631 --> 00:13:19,470
Rym: This is how a thousand years from now, we're just wizards, and technology is just magic.

190
00:13:20,031 --> 00:13:25,190
Scott: After you perform the registration ceremony, they've got your public key, and they've associated it with your account.

191
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:30,349
Scott: And so, you come back three days later, and they're like, "Hey, you want to log into the Scott

192
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:30,650
Scott: account?".

193
00:13:30,891 --> 00:13:31,332
Scott: And you're like,

194
00:13:31,553 --> 00:13:31,853
Scott: "Yeah.".

195
00:13:32,194 --> 00:13:32,876
Scott: They're like, "All right.

196
00:13:33,338 --> 00:13:35,022
Scott: We already have Scott's public key.

197
00:13:35,424 --> 00:13:35,825
Scott: Prove it.

198
00:13:35,965 --> 00:13:37,409
Scott: Prove that you have Scott's private

199
00:13:37,429 --> 00:13:37,530
Scott: key.".

200
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:38,372
Scott: I proved it.

201
00:13:38,492 --> 00:13:44,970
Scott: I did my Windows Hello, or my Apple Touch ID, or my Apple Face ID, or my whatever the fuck it is that your device does.

202
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,837
Scott: And they go, "Ah, you have proved it.

203
00:13:48,018 --> 00:13:51,147
Scott: You are the same person who registered for this website five days

204
00:13:51,187 --> 00:13:51,408
Scott: ago.".

205
00:13:51,428 --> 00:13:51,528
Scott: Right?

206
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:53,072
Scott: "You're logged in.

207
00:13:53,192 --> 00:13:54,395
Scott: No password necessary.

208
00:13:54,415 --> 00:13:57,181
Scott: No, not, you know, you hit the Yuba key.

209
00:13:57,201 --> 00:13:59,606
Scott: That was the same Yuba key that was used when you registered.

210
00:14:00,068 --> 00:14:00,529
Scott: You're good to

211
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:00,729
Scott: go.".

212
00:14:02,233 --> 00:14:05,520
Scott: And this is hugely, hugely beneficial.

213
00:14:05,881 --> 00:14:06,583
Scott: Is it perfect?

214
00:14:06,783 --> 00:14:07,044
Scott: No.

215
00:14:07,224 --> 00:14:08,628
Scott: But is it better than passwords?

216
00:14:08,668 --> 00:14:09,610
Scott: A thousand times, yes.

217
00:14:10,311 --> 00:14:14,704
Rym: Let's say you did it without any further, like there's no other passkey or biometric or anything.

218
00:14:14,724 --> 00:14:16,630
Rym: You just use that and no password.

219
00:14:18,151 --> 00:14:20,317
Rym: It's still better than just a password.

220
00:14:20,357 --> 00:14:24,930
Rym: Like, if you're going to have one factor, passkey is objectively superior to a password.

221
00:14:25,572 --> 00:14:28,619
Scott: In a lot of ways, it might even be better than two-factor, right?

222
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:29,822
Scott: Consider this, right?

223
00:14:29,862 --> 00:14:32,689
Scott: So, first of all, "Oh no, the website's database is

224
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:32,950
Scott: hacked.".

225
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,914
Scott: Okay, they got a bunch of public keys.

226
00:14:36,335 --> 00:14:37,598
Scott: Useless, right?

227
00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:42,227
Scott: No way they can decrypt, you know, do rainbow tables and find passwords or anything.

228
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,410
Rym: Completely useless.

229
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:44,093
Rym: Rainbow table?

230
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,170
Rym: No one younger than 40 knows what a rainbow table is.

231
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:47,739
Scott: I'm just saying, it's completely useless.

232
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:48,684
Scott: You hacked the database.

233
00:14:48,704 --> 00:14:49,790
Scott: You can never get anyone's password.

234
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,398
Scott: "Oh, someone's using the same password on a bunch of different

235
00:14:52,418 --> 00:14:52,799
Scott: websites.".

236
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,184
Scott: No, they're not, right?

237
00:14:54,224 --> 00:14:56,250
Scott: They're using different keys, right?

238
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:58,155
Scott: It's all different encryption everywhere, right?

239
00:14:58,256 --> 00:15:01,104
Scott: Behind the scenes, the user doesn't even know that it's happening, right?

240
00:15:02,047 --> 00:15:03,190
Scott: So, none of that's happening.

241
00:15:03,551 --> 00:15:04,615
Scott: "Oh, someone's using a weak

242
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:05,237
Scott: password.".

243
00:15:05,518 --> 00:15:08,810
Scott: No, everyone's using a really strong private key because they don't have to remember anything.

244
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,658
Scott: So, it's super strong no matter where you go.

245
00:15:10,979 --> 00:15:13,590
Scott: Good luck breaking anybody's anything, right?

246
00:15:14,171 --> 00:15:21,469
Scott: It's like the only way, you know, to basically bust into someone's stuff, you know, "Oh, someone made a fake website to try to phish

247
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:21,609
Scott: you.".

248
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:22,751
Scott: What's to phish?

249
00:15:23,192 --> 00:15:23,913
Scott: You can't phish it.

250
00:15:23,993 --> 00:15:25,395
Scott: It's unphishable, right?

251
00:15:25,435 --> 00:15:35,870
Scott: Because you can't, you know, in order for the Windows Hello or whatever to send you, you know, what you would need to impersonate bank.com, it won't do it.

252
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,353
Scott: You'd have to be bank.com.

253
00:15:37,393 --> 00:15:38,535
Scott: It can't be done, right?

254
00:15:38,636 --> 00:15:42,022
Scott: It's like, so phishing, not a problem anymore.

255
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:44,928
Scott: Basically, all these, you know, people don't remember passwords.

256
00:15:44,988 --> 00:15:45,790
Scott: Well, nothing to remember.

257
00:15:46,651 --> 00:15:50,702
Scott: So, the only problem is, hey, someone gets your phone, right?

258
00:15:50,823 --> 00:15:53,330
Rym: And you didn't listen to our advice in that other episode.

259
00:15:54,112 --> 00:15:54,273
Scott: Yeah.

260
00:15:54,433 --> 00:15:58,025
Scott: And they unlock it and you help them with your face ID.

261
00:15:58,466 --> 00:15:59,550
Scott: Well, now they can log into Apple.

262
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:05,730
Rym: Or worse, like the most common Discord scan when people say they get hacked is actually just someone's fucking with you.

263
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:10,268
Rym: And then they just convince you to scan a barcode in your Discord app that logs them in.

264
00:16:11,151 --> 00:16:11,952
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

265
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:12,873
Scott: So that can still happen.

266
00:16:14,315 --> 00:16:23,467
Scott: But yeah, it's like we, you know, implementing passkeys everywhere will be a great boon to user security everywhere.

267
00:16:24,168 --> 00:16:25,590
Scott: I plan to implement it.

268
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:26,351
Rym: Absolutely.

269
00:16:26,371 --> 00:16:44,910
Rym: And I'm excited, honestly, because now we're getting critical mass of big companies with widely deployed infrastructure using this stuff, getting people used to it, and also standardizing in a way to where, like, it's easy for people who might listen to, say, GeekNights to set up a YubiKey or set up like traditional TOTP.

270
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:50,700
Rym: But moving to passkey like this will, for most people who can't achieve that, just work.

271
00:16:51,422 --> 00:16:53,926
Rym: And then things like 1Password can mostly just disappear.

272
00:16:53,966 --> 00:16:55,950
Rym: Like, we don't need to remember passwords anymore.

273
00:16:56,631 --> 00:17:15,227
Scott: So the major downside, while 1Password might be able to help you, if you use it for your passkeys across platforms, right, because this is the one major tricky part that I think is gonna be a problem, is that, I think it's really gonna be the biggest problem, is that there are roaming authenticators, like YubiKey or 1Password.

274
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:17,990
Scott: You can use those on a bunch of different devices, right?

275
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:21,595
Scott: The same YubiKey on your phone, the same YubiKey on your computer, right?

276
00:17:21,635 --> 00:17:24,299
Scott: The same YubiKey on another phone or a tablet or a laptop.

277
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,382
Scott: You just got one YubiKey, use it everywhere, right?

278
00:17:27,002 --> 00:17:31,470
Scott: But if you got, say, if you don't have a YubiKey, let's say you're using your phone, right?

279
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:40,744
Scott: Well, you might have some system, right, where you could, like, use your phone like it's a YubiKey to unlock on other devices, maybe, if, you know, Apple might help you out with that or something.

280
00:17:40,804 --> 00:17:44,250
Scott: But for the most part, that's not a roaming authenticator.

281
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,174
Scott: That's a platform authenticator, right?

282
00:17:47,214 --> 00:17:57,470
Scott: So if you log in to, say, Google with Windows Hello, and then you try to go and you're on your iPhone, it's like, well, you can't get your Windows Hello on your iPhone.

283
00:17:58,731 --> 00:18:05,029
Rym: But if you're a nerd and you have, like, a YubiKey or something like that, then you can use that kind of thing to facilitate passkeys anywhere.

284
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:09,134
Scott: Or, like, Apple is using iCloud to synchronize.

285
00:18:09,294 --> 00:18:16,120
Scott: So, like, if you log in with, you know, Face ID on your phone and then you go to your Mac, it's like it'll be synced over.

286
00:18:16,501 --> 00:18:25,850
Scott: But it's like if you're not syncing, let's say some Linux user logs in with their Android phone and then they go to their Linux computer.

287
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:33,650
Scott: It's like, well, that platform authenticator on their Android phone is not on their Linux computer.

288
00:18:33,832 --> 00:18:35,209
Rym: I've started calling that person.

289
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:38,078
Scott: And they can't move the private key over.

290
00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:39,543
Scott: It's in a secure whatever.

291
00:18:39,783 --> 00:18:41,910
Scott: So we got to figure something else out, right?

292
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:45,947
Rym: So I've started calling that person Linux Gjorg in the same way that...

293
00:18:46,571 --> 00:18:47,149
Scott: What's Gjorg?

294
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,211
Rym: So there's an old meme.

295
00:18:48,251 --> 00:18:51,316
Rym: I guess you just never encountered it or you might remember it when I tell it.

296
00:18:51,356 --> 00:18:58,948
Rym: But very briefly, there's the statistic, you know, the fake one that, you know, the average human eats six spiders at night in their lifetime.

297
00:18:58,988 --> 00:19:00,270
Rym: And that's not really true.

298
00:19:00,711 --> 00:19:03,937
Rym: What actually happens is the average person eats zero spiders while they're asleep.

299
00:19:04,298 --> 00:19:10,070
Rym: And then there's this one dude living in Serbia named Spiders Gjorg who eats thousands of spiders every day on purpose.

300
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:11,840
Scott: OK.

301
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,569
Rym: So it's like the weird outlier.

302
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:16,470
Scott: Send Spiders Gjorg a Nokia N-Gage, though.

303
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:23,901
Rym: So two hours Gjorg was what two of our friends call the person who makes an otherwise short game take way too long.

304
00:19:23,941 --> 00:19:25,003
Rym: that normally doesn't happen.

305
00:19:25,604 --> 00:19:28,870
Rym: And Linux Gjorg is the person who has the kind of problem you described.

306
00:19:29,891 --> 00:19:30,171
Scott: OK.

307
00:19:30,292 --> 00:19:33,360
Scott: Well, anyway, pass keys are good.

308
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:35,727
Scott: I recommend using them.

309
00:19:36,469 --> 00:19:36,710
Rym: The end.

310
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:37,711
Rym: And I did a poll.

311
00:19:37,852 --> 00:19:39,014
Rym: of the people watching the stream.

312
00:19:40,398 --> 00:19:45,470
Rym: Of the people who responded to the poll, only one of them had any idea what the hell a rainbow table was.

313
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:46,674
Rym: OK.

314
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:49,269
Rym: The other four had no idea and Googled it.

315
00:19:50,072 --> 00:19:50,756
Scott: Well, the other four.

316
00:19:51,018 --> 00:19:51,219
Scott: Good.

317
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:51,803
Scott: You Googled it.

318
00:19:52,105 --> 00:19:52,869
Scott: That's all you need to know.

319
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:53,790
Scott: How to Google.

320
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:55,308
Scott: Congrats.

321
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:57,679
Rym: They haven't been a thing for like 15, 16 years or more.

322
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:00,672
Scott: Yeah.

323
00:20:01,095 --> 00:20:02,869
Scott: No, it's it's super old, but it's still, you know.

324
00:20:03,891 --> 00:20:04,661
Rym: So let's see.

325
00:20:04,681 --> 00:20:05,329
Rym: And some other news.

326
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:17,390
Rym: Not going to get too deep into it, but I think you should read this article, especially if you're involved in software architecture or like infrastructure or anything that's sort of deployed at scale.

327
00:20:17,931 --> 00:20:25,710
Rym: If you use Amazon, but anything beyond just having easy to instances, because one, this article is really good and there's a lot to think about.

328
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:34,630
Rym: But also, it is very easy to skim this article or to just read the extremely click bait headline and come away with the exact wrong conclusion.

329
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:45,230
Rym: So what I'm going to say is either read this article all the way through or don't read it at all, because if you just skim it, you might you might think some really wrong things.

330
00:20:45,431 --> 00:20:48,010
Scott: Yeah, I think the headline was a bit too simplistic.

331
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:48,570
Scott: Right.

332
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:56,930
Scott: And people people read the headline only and the article got widespread, even though it was just another one of those, you know, here's the story of the technology we did.

333
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:57,913
Scott: Yeah, deals.

334
00:20:58,134 --> 00:21:02,109
Rym: Amazon Prime video team throws AWS serverless under a bus.

335
00:21:03,253 --> 00:21:03,819
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

336
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,850
Scott: that's not what happened.

337
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:17,510
Scott: So the broad the summary is that, you know, the serverless architectures that you can use and Amazon Web Services offers a lot of things that count as serverless things like Oz Lambda is really the big.

338
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:18,998
Rym: That's the one I've used.

339
00:21:19,562 --> 00:21:20,750
Rym: The only one I've used actually.

340
00:21:21,732 --> 00:21:24,030
Scott: They've got like, you know, and there's other things that are somewhat serverless.

341
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,768
Scott: You know, your DynamoDBs and things like that.

342
00:21:26,829 --> 00:21:27,050
Scott: Right.

343
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,074
Scott: You know, your SQSQs.

344
00:21:29,635 --> 00:21:35,390
Scott: And basically the idea is that, you know, you architect your software in terms of like what the processes are.

345
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:36,131
Scott: Right.

346
00:21:36,352 --> 00:21:43,089
Scott: And you don't need to worry about like how many CPUs, how much RAM, how much storage, you know, upgrading software, any of that.

347
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:46,823
Rym: What fucking EC2 instance am I running this on and do I need a bigger one?

348
00:21:46,843 --> 00:21:48,630
Rym: and what Python library is installed in there?

349
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,468
Scott: You don't need to worry about any of that bullshit.

350
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:50,650
Scott: Right.

351
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:57,410
Scott: But if you use other, you know, an example of not serverless would be something like Amazon RDS, where you use, you know, you get a database server.

352
00:21:57,711 --> 00:21:58,837
Scott: It is easy.

353
00:21:58,857 --> 00:22:01,309
Scott: You just one click, they spin up a database server for you.

354
00:22:01,751 --> 00:22:01,891
Scott: Right.

355
00:22:01,931 --> 00:22:08,790
Scott: Let's say you get a Postgres on RDS, but you still have to worry about how much storage it has, how much CPU it has, what scale to set it at.

356
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:09,695
Scott: Do you need more of them?

357
00:22:09,755 --> 00:22:11,887
Scott: Do you have to configure you to configure them?

358
00:22:12,229 --> 00:22:12,390
Scott: Right.

359
00:22:12,671 --> 00:22:16,768
Scott: It's like the serverless stuff is like you barely you don't really configure it much at all.

360
00:22:17,129 --> 00:22:17,290
Scott: Right.

361
00:22:17,591 --> 00:22:19,618
Scott: And you're just paid by usage.

362
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:20,160
Scott: Right.

363
00:22:20,181 --> 00:22:22,750
Scott: So it's like you get some lambdas, you just put your code.

364
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:26,446
Scott: All you need is the code you want to run and lambdas run your code.

365
00:22:26,848 --> 00:22:27,250
Rym: The end.

366
00:22:27,831 --> 00:22:27,991
Rym: Yep.

367
00:22:28,011 --> 00:22:35,930
Rym: So a really trivial example, server website, I click on your link and you've got Apache running in an EC2 instance that responds to that click.

368
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:40,470
Rym: It does a bunch of stuff on a regular server or you click that link.

369
00:22:40,971 --> 00:22:48,170
Rym: And in a Lambda instance, like one little Lambda is spun up to execute a piece of code that will do something that will serve that website.

370
00:22:48,672 --> 00:22:52,650
Rym: If a million people click on that link, a million Lambdas spin up to handle them all.

371
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:54,095
Scott: Well, maybe not a million.

372
00:22:54,397 --> 00:22:56,406
Rym: I mean, you might obviously do something more clever.

373
00:22:56,446 --> 00:22:57,370
Rym: They get reused.

374
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,674
Scott: But the point is it's invisible.

375
00:22:58,694 --> 00:23:00,719
Scott: The point is it's invisible to the developer.

376
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:04,550
Scott: The developer doesn't have to configure a Web server.

377
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,212
Scott: Right.

378
00:23:05,774 --> 00:23:10,870
Scott: So the reason this is beneficial is because if you're just starting making a brand new application.

379
00:23:11,271 --> 00:23:12,254
Scott: Right.

380
00:23:12,274 --> 00:23:15,566
Scott: And you just want to think, you know, is this application even going to succeed?

381
00:23:15,626 --> 00:23:16,670
Scott: Is anyone going to use it?

382
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:18,114
Scott: You don't know enough about it yet.

383
00:23:18,315 --> 00:23:20,061
Scott: It's a brand new idea or it's you're.

384
00:23:20,101 --> 00:23:22,910
Rym: just you might change it radically halfway through the project.

385
00:23:23,531 --> 00:23:26,479
Scott: It's a lot of work, you know, for the Ignites website.

386
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:26,680
Scott: Right.

387
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,341
Scott: It was a lot of.

388
00:23:27,502 --> 00:23:30,370
Scott: most of the work was like deploying an architecture stuff.

389
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,734
Scott: You can just avoid all that work.

390
00:23:32,276 --> 00:23:32,878
Scott: Right.

391
00:23:32,898 --> 00:23:37,050
Scott: And, you know, and you don't have to worry about scaling or anything because it automatically scales.

392
00:23:37,231 --> 00:23:37,392
Scott: Right.

393
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:40,489
Scott: If suddenly a million people visit, well, a million Lambdas will happen.

394
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:41,031
Scott: Yeah.

395
00:23:41,051 --> 00:23:43,662
Scott: It's like it's on demand usage.

396
00:23:44,204 --> 00:23:45,770
Scott: So you'll never run out of hard drive space.

397
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:47,099
Scott: You'll never run out of RAM.

398
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:47,884
Scott: You never run out of seat.

399
00:23:47,905 --> 00:23:48,710
Scott: You never run anything.

400
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:52,130
Rym: Instead you pay like 0.00 something cents per action.

401
00:23:52,571 --> 00:23:52,751
Scott: Right.

402
00:23:53,133 --> 00:23:56,163
Scott: You might run out of money, though, if usage gets out of control.

403
00:23:56,404 --> 00:23:56,664
Scott: Right.

404
00:23:56,705 --> 00:23:58,310
Scott: Because it's you could put limits on it.

405
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:04,550
Scott: But it's the point is you could, you know, so and it might not always be the fastest, best solution.

406
00:24:05,171 --> 00:24:15,290
Scott: So what you want to do is after you get your application up and running serverless wise, you might notice like, hey, that particular process doesn't get run very often.

407
00:24:15,531 --> 00:24:15,751
Scott: Right.

408
00:24:15,831 --> 00:24:16,613
Scott: It's really rare.

409
00:24:16,994 --> 00:24:23,650
Scott: So keeping that on something like a Lambda serverless is a great idea because it spins up for that fraction of a second.

410
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:24,172
Scott: You need it.

411
00:24:24,573 --> 00:24:26,057
Scott: And the rest of the time you're not paying.

412
00:24:26,077 --> 00:24:30,590
Rym: because if you didn't do it that way, you either have a weak server running that service.

413
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:31,071
Rym: Right.

414
00:24:31,091 --> 00:24:38,590
Scott: And then if you get overwhelmed, you have some weak, tiny server that's always on that barely gets used and you're losing money on it, even though it's a tiny.

415
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:42,240
Rym: Or if you want to scale it, you've got a big honking server running that isn't fucking doing anything.

416
00:24:43,003 --> 00:24:43,243
Scott: Right.

417
00:24:43,604 --> 00:24:45,470
Scott: But the problem is, is the opposite.

418
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:49,043
Scott: Let's say one of your processes is like getting used all the time.

419
00:24:49,104 --> 00:24:50,288
Scott: It is mega intensive.

420
00:24:50,308 --> 00:24:50,790
Scott: Right.

421
00:24:51,131 --> 00:25:02,350
Scott: It's like, well, actually, for that case, you would save money by configuring a server that's always on and can handle all the right things coming in instead of using a serverless thing.

422
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,453
Scott: And that's what happened with the Amazon.

423
00:25:04,593 --> 00:25:16,790
Scott: Think about the difference between parts of our prime video service are like, you know, we could save money, save resources, do a better job by doing the effort to set up some servers for those parts.

424
00:25:17,691 --> 00:25:21,577
Scott: And it'll be faster, cheaper, better, stronger, because really they're both.

425
00:25:21,597 --> 00:25:29,730
Rym: they're they're both solving the same kind of problem, which is usually an orchestration problem, which might be worth a episode.

426
00:25:31,291 --> 00:25:32,533
Scott: I think I think we did some.

427
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:41,450
Rym: we might have because that's actually a big part of my job right now is orchestrated architect, like how we do orchestration at scale.

428
00:25:41,911 --> 00:25:56,750
Rym: But I guess if you have only ever worked at one company or only ever worked below a certain scale or just haven't like you haven't been in the industry long enough or an industry long enough, you might think that there's this divide between monolithic architecture versus microservice architecture.

429
00:25:56,790 --> 00:26:08,105
Rym: And the reality is any sufficiently complex project or architecture will be a mix of both and figuring out what to architect, how in a broader orchestrated workflow.

430
00:26:08,705 --> 00:26:12,190
Rym: that is the job that pays the most money, because that is a hard problem to solve.

431
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:22,170
Scott: But the point of this news, you know, people are spreading this news as if it was Amazon saying, oh, all that server stuff is bad.

432
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:25,748
Scott: Go back to EC2 and setting up servers the old way.

433
00:26:25,788 --> 00:26:26,190
Scott: That's better.

434
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:28,669
Rym: That's not even what this team did.

435
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:30,292
Scott: No, not at all.

436
00:26:30,552 --> 00:26:30,712
Scott: Right.

437
00:26:30,752 --> 00:26:40,070
Scott: The news is basically like, hey, you know, sometimes doing it the old way for some services is better and sometimes is not.

438
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:41,876
Scott: Especially like common sense.

439
00:26:42,056 --> 00:26:46,410
Scott: They were just telling you a specific case, right, in detail of what happened.

440
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:56,530
Rym: And the case is actually a super common case, the case where you might have a bunch of microservices or a monolith, but you're doing a thing where the data set you have to take action on is big.

441
00:26:57,050 --> 00:27:07,390
Rym: So if you set it up, if you architected the wrong way, you're going to take a big blob of data and pass it around between things a bunch of times.

442
00:27:08,031 --> 00:27:10,416
Rym: And that generally is a bad idea.

443
00:27:11,057 --> 00:27:17,310
Rym: And in my job, we have some things that do it that way because that gives you a lot of power and a lot of flexibility.

444
00:27:17,791 --> 00:27:20,318
Rym: But it costs you a lot of overhead.

445
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:24,470
Rym: And we have other processes where the orchestration is happening somewhere else.

446
00:27:24,791 --> 00:27:28,950
Rym: But the data blob is sitting somewhere and getting basically fucked with destructively.

447
00:27:30,291 --> 00:27:30,472
Scott: Yep.

448
00:27:30,532 --> 00:27:34,407
Scott: You could just have, you know, one machine that holds the data blob in RAM all the time.

449
00:27:34,468 --> 00:27:34,929
Scott: And it's like, woo.

450
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:45,470
Rym: And especially remember, the problem in this article is QAing live streaming high definition video, like frame by frame.

451
00:27:46,483 --> 00:27:46,629
Scott: Yep.

452
00:27:48,032 --> 00:27:49,156
Rym: I think that's enough news.

453
00:27:49,216 --> 00:27:53,130
Rym: So let's get right into things of the day.

454
00:27:54,712 --> 00:28:00,270
Rym: So this is going to be the last time I talk about anything even remotely related to fast Fourier transform for a while.

455
00:28:00,811 --> 00:28:06,110
Rym: But my thing of the day is a video that's kind of old, but I just encountered it.

456
00:28:06,511 --> 00:28:07,514
Rym: But it explains it.

457
00:28:08,076 --> 00:28:10,565
Rym: It connects two dots that I didn't know could be connected.

458
00:28:11,046 --> 00:28:11,950
Rym: And it kind of fucked me up.

459
00:28:12,551 --> 00:28:21,730
Rym: So, you know, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle that we can't know the momentum and like we can't know the location and the momentum of a thing.

460
00:28:22,231 --> 00:28:28,210
Rym: We can either approximately know both or exactly know one and have no fucking idea about the other or some combination.

461
00:28:28,351 --> 00:28:29,375
Rym: But we cannot know both.

462
00:28:29,475 --> 00:28:29,977
Rym: Absolutely.

463
00:28:30,298 --> 00:28:33,350
Rym: That is a as best we can tell, hard fact to the universe.

464
00:28:33,651 --> 00:28:37,689
Rym: And it's also the only reason quantum entanglement and like atoms can exist.

465
00:28:38,471 --> 00:28:41,369
Scott: Do you know where I am or do you know when I am?

466
00:28:41,811 --> 00:28:46,328
Rym: I know approximately where and when you are, but I don't know the specifics because I can't see your whole body right now.

467
00:28:48,692 --> 00:28:50,321
Scott: Maybe I've got like a genie legs.

468
00:28:50,784 --> 00:28:51,286
Rym: Just a wisp.

469
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,227
Rym: Or just a snake down there.

470
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:54,351
Scott: Ooh.

471
00:28:54,372 --> 00:28:55,390
Scott: Let me action.

472
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:55,656
Rym: Yeah.

473
00:28:58,871 --> 00:29:05,030
Rym: So my thing of the day is a video titled The More General Uncertainty Principle.

474
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:07,288
Rym: And this is what fucked me up.

475
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:19,450
Rym: Turns out Fourier transformations and the theory of why that works has the same constraints as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

476
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:29,250
Rym: Because the Heisenberg uncertainty principle is basically just a single case of this more fundamental mathematical uncertainty principle.

477
00:29:31,011 --> 00:29:32,216
Rym: And that fucked me up.

478
00:29:32,417 --> 00:29:33,461
Rym: And you got to watch this video.

479
00:29:33,482 --> 00:29:35,008
Rym: You got to be as fucked up as I am about it.

480
00:29:35,951 --> 00:29:36,139
Scott: All right.

481
00:29:37,357 --> 00:29:37,910
Scott: It's real good.

482
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:39,294
Scott: So my thing of the day.

483
00:29:39,314 --> 00:29:43,130
Scott: So you might know Russia not doing great right now.

484
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:43,612
Rym: Yeah.

485
00:29:43,652 --> 00:29:44,408
Scott: Bad times there.

486
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:51,930
Rym: Russia's speedrunning the world of a hundred years ago by invading Europe from the east with genocidal ambitions.

487
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:56,461
Scott: Anyway, the people who live in Russia are not all bad.

488
00:29:57,123 --> 00:29:59,250
Scott: Some of them are bad, but some of them are not bad.

489
00:29:59,570 --> 00:29:59,691
Scott: Yeah.

490
00:29:59,711 --> 00:30:00,014
Rym: Well, imagine.

491
00:30:00,034 --> 00:30:02,270
Rym: Let's say you're the best person in the world and you live in Russia.

492
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:06,250
Rym: What the fuck are you going to do that doesn't just get you executed or sent to jail?

493
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:07,710
Rym: Like, you're really stuck.

494
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:11,330
Scott: Somehow flee, but you got to flee without getting executed.

495
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:12,125
Rym: And guess what happened?

496
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:17,690
Rym: So many people have fled Russia that it has actually severely hampered their entire economy.

497
00:30:18,592 --> 00:30:18,832
Scott: OK.

498
00:30:18,952 --> 00:30:28,550
Scott: Well, anyway, the point is, is that there are people in Russia who do not have access to or not easy access to truthful news.

499
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:29,714
Scott: Right.

500
00:30:29,734 --> 00:30:31,790
Scott: I mean, that's true, I guess everywhere in the world.

501
00:30:32,111 --> 00:30:37,430
Scott: But in Russia, particularly with regarding news of the war that they are that they started.

502
00:30:38,532 --> 00:30:44,190
Scott: The people in Russia, many of them are misinformed, underinformed regarding what's going on.

503
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:44,652
Rym: And like in the

504
00:30:44,732 --> 00:30:44,953
Rym: U.S.,

505
00:30:44,973 --> 00:30:48,810
Rym: there's fake information and fake news and some people choose to read fake news.

506
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:53,230
Rym: But we're talking here about the people in Russia who see the fake news that their government puts out.

507
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:57,250
Rym: But they want to know the real truth about what's happening in the world.

508
00:30:57,652 --> 00:30:57,935
Rym: They want.

509
00:30:58,137 --> 00:30:59,229
Scott: So how do you.

510
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:05,849
Scott: So if there's people in Russia who want to read real news about the war that their country started and they want to know what's really going on.

511
00:31:07,412 --> 00:31:11,170
Scott: I mean, there are plenty of people from other countries who are happy to report it to them.

512
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:14,170
Scott: I mean, there's people from Russia who are happy to report it to them, but they'll get stopped.

513
00:31:14,491 --> 00:31:17,409
Scott: So but so other countries want to report it to them.

514
00:31:17,831 --> 00:31:20,910
Scott: But how do you get that news to someone who is in Russia?

515
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,683
Scott: Well, you can't like just mail them a newspaper.

516
00:31:22,723 --> 00:31:23,429
Scott: That's not going to work.

517
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:31,030
Scott: It's like the Russians are going to read the mail and it's going to go right to the house of the person who's going to get in trouble for getting that in the mail.

518
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:34,430
Scott: So can they just go to CNN dot com?

519
00:31:34,772 --> 00:31:36,890
Scott: No, that shit is blocked on their Internet.

520
00:31:36,971 --> 00:31:39,690
Scott: And I guess they could do fancy Internet tricks to try to get around that.

521
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:42,390
Scott: But, yeah, can't really just go to a news Web site.

522
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:42,590
Scott: Right.

523
00:31:42,611 --> 00:31:48,570
Scott: You got to go do some Internet that is not sent censored, not surveilled, et cetera.

524
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:52,930
Scott: Now, there's a lot of ways you could do this if you were trying to do it on purpose.

525
00:31:53,431 --> 00:31:53,672
Scott: Right.

526
00:31:54,798 --> 00:31:57,170
Scott: But what if you were the news organization?

527
00:31:57,752 --> 00:31:59,062
Scott: You're not the reader.

528
00:31:59,163 --> 00:32:00,150
Scott: You're the publisher.

529
00:32:01,032 --> 00:32:03,609
Scott: You want to get that news in front of eyeballs.

530
00:32:04,371 --> 00:32:04,632
Scott: Right.

531
00:32:04,953 --> 00:32:08,690
Scott: Who may not be seeking it out and may not be trying to hide on the Internet.

532
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:14,970
Scott: You have to find some other way to get those bits of news to Russian people living in Russia.

533
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:15,951
Scott: And what?

534
00:32:15,971 --> 00:32:20,850
Scott: this news is a Finnish newspaper, I think Finland's main newspaper.

535
00:32:21,473 --> 00:32:21,674
Scott: Yeah.

536
00:32:21,694 --> 00:32:22,218
Scott: What they did.

537
00:32:22,904 --> 00:32:23,609
Scott: So genius.

538
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:26,087
Scott: Counter-Strike is popular in Russia.

539
00:32:27,771 --> 00:32:30,690
Rym: It's one of the most popular online video games in Russia.

540
00:32:31,572 --> 00:32:32,079
Scott: In the world.

541
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:32,790
Scott: But in Russia.

542
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,118
Scott: Yeah, it's really popular there.

543
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:35,970
Scott: They made a Counter-Strike level.

544
00:32:36,513 --> 00:32:36,734
Scott: Right.

545
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:39,430
Scott: It's like Counter-Strike maps aren't censored people in Russia.

546
00:32:41,553 --> 00:32:44,789
Scott: And in the Counter-Strike level, they made a secret room.

547
00:32:45,131 --> 00:32:49,810
Scott: And in the secret room, there's just newspapers to read and they have real news on them.

548
00:32:51,031 --> 00:32:56,370
Scott: So if you play this Counter-Strike map and you go to the secret room, which, of course, everyone wants to hear the secret room.

549
00:32:56,431 --> 00:32:57,428
Scott: They want to go there real bad.

550
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:57,891
Rym: Yep.

551
00:32:58,191 --> 00:33:10,410
Rym: But I want to point out right now, there are very likely many, many more things now just like this that are not getting a bunch of news reporting, because when news report news reports on this stuff, eventually someone figures that out.

552
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:11,191
Scott: Right.

553
00:33:11,552 --> 00:33:17,370
Scott: So the point is, as long as you can, you know, the fundamental truth that we've always known is that if you can communicate with another person.

554
00:33:17,971 --> 00:33:18,191
Scott: Right.

555
00:33:18,552 --> 00:33:25,310
Scott: Then you can communicate with them any information you want without any chance of surveillance, et cetera, if you go through the effort.

556
00:33:25,571 --> 00:33:25,772
Scott: Right.

557
00:33:25,832 --> 00:33:28,948
Scott: That's that's just true because encryption is a thing, et cetera.

558
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:37,850
Scott: But, you know, if all the, you know, if communication can be blocked, well, it doesn't matter.

559
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:43,130
Rym: This is arguably a highly evolved form of modern steganography.

560
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:48,870
Scott: Yeah, that's what I'm saying is that if you just, you know, are they going to block Counter-Strike maps?

561
00:33:49,073 --> 00:33:50,009
Scott: It's like, good luck with that.

562
00:33:50,351 --> 00:33:55,270
Scott: Are they going to surveil all Counter-Strike maps?

563
00:33:55,490 --> 00:34:00,430
Scott: It's like, OK, we can just move on to something else, a steganography of some other form.

564
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:03,710
Scott: It's like, are you going to block all YouTube videos?

565
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:04,667
Scott: It's like, you know.

566
00:34:05,152 --> 00:34:05,535
Rym: Yeah.

567
00:34:05,555 --> 00:34:07,510
Rym: What if someone makes a Skyrim mod?

568
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:08,768
Scott: They probably do block all YouTube.

569
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:09,371
Rym: Yeah.

570
00:34:09,391 --> 00:34:14,510
Rym: And in the Skyrim mod, there is a place you can go where there's an arrangement of pots on the ground.

571
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:18,570
Rym: And if you fly up in the air, the pots tell you a Russian URL that will tell you news.

572
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:23,230
Rym: Like, how do you even detect stuff like that without active surveillance?

573
00:34:23,409 --> 00:34:27,268
Rym: I guess the key here is this kind of thing cannot be discovered.

574
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:38,429
Rym: Now, it can be dealt with once it's known or once it's discovered, but it cannot be discovered by the intelligence apparatus of a hostile actor without active surveillance.

575
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:39,648
Rym: Someone has to find it.

576
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:44,850
Rym: There's no firewall filter that looks for an arrangement of pots in a Counter-Strike map.

577
00:34:47,137 --> 00:34:48,550
Rym: This is really good stuff.

578
00:34:48,991 --> 00:35:02,550
Rym: And I encourage any of you out there, if you are a nerd and you know how to do stuff like this and you feel bad about what's happening in Ukraine and you want to help, one thing you could do is try to smuggle real news into Russia via Counter-Strike maps.

579
00:35:04,134 --> 00:35:06,010
Scott: Or by any other kind of mechanism.

580
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,507
Rym: Cheeky breeky.

581
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:13,870
Rym: In the meta moment, Geek Knights Book Club book, The Satanic Versus.

582
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:16,690
Rym: We didn't do the show on Thursday because I had a work thing.

583
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:20,990
Rym: Fun fact, the work thing ended up being at The Uncommons downtown.

584
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:29,590
Rym: Also, fun fact, maybe 20% of the people invited to this thing were nerds with high power levels.

585
00:35:30,131 --> 00:35:36,829
Rym: And everyone else were just like senior people, older than me, my age, who don't really know what the hell's going on.

586
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,362
Scott: How did people fit in the time?

587
00:35:38,422 --> 00:35:39,170
Scott: Isn't it still tiny?

588
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:40,386
Rym: We rented the whole place out.

589
00:35:41,053 --> 00:35:42,826
Scott: Yeah, but it's a tiny place though, even with the whole thing.

590
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:46,530
Rym: So they've got that room on the side on the left?

591
00:35:46,771 --> 00:35:48,230
Scott: Yeah, they've always had that room on the side.

592
00:35:49,292 --> 00:35:50,970
Rym: And we were packed in pretty tight.

593
00:35:52,171 --> 00:35:54,189
Scott: Okay, I haven't been there in many years.

594
00:35:54,591 --> 00:35:55,910
Rym: We had also spilled out to the outside.

595
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:57,010
Scott: It didn't look bigger.

596
00:35:57,550 --> 00:36:02,768
Rym: That place is still hopping too because all night people kept trying to come in, but it was rented out all night by us.

597
00:36:03,651 --> 00:36:08,910
Scott: Yeah, the fact that they're still in business in a Manhattan location tells me that yes, it is a popular business.

598
00:36:08,931 --> 00:36:09,039
Scott: Yep.

599
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:10,677
Scott: I kickstarted them.

600
00:36:10,697 --> 00:36:11,989
Scott: That's how long ago I was done.

601
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:13,748
Scott: When they didn't exist.

602
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:17,210
Rym: So next week, Thursday, we will have the show on The Book Club Book.

603
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:20,590
Rym: So if you haven't started reading it yet, it's not that long a read.

604
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:24,384
Scott: It's a pretty straightforward, allegorical- I read it in a month because that's how long they.

605
00:36:24,404 --> 00:36:25,370
Scott: let me have the library book.

606
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:26,849
Rym: Yeah, Magical Reels and Fantasy Book.

607
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:29,350
Scott: I only had to read like 30 pages a day or something.

608
00:36:29,731 --> 00:36:32,990
Scott: When I started reading it- Maybe not less than 30.

609
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:39,765
Rym: So when I started reading it, because I remember and it ended up being pretty accurate, my Kindle said, "It'll take you about nine hours to read this book to the

610
00:36:39,845 --> 00:36:39,946
Rym: end.".

611
00:36:41,392 --> 00:36:41,715
Rym: Total.

612
00:36:41,775 --> 00:36:43,410
Rym: Like, total reading time.

613
00:36:45,192 --> 00:36:55,910
Rym: So in the rest of the meta moment, you might have noticed a bunch of old GeekNights YouTube videos have new thumbnails, which has caused them to pop up in people's feeds again because it seems to be how the algorithm works.

614
00:36:56,391 --> 00:37:06,850
Rym: But because I remembered that old GeekNights panels existed, and I looked, and some of those videos predated when I even had the ability to upload a thumbnail.

615
00:37:08,411 --> 00:37:13,130
Rym: Some of them had terrible thumbnails because I was just bad at Photoshop back then.

616
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:14,729
Scott: Some of them are just pictures of us.

617
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:21,330
Rym: Yep, some of them are just the automatically generated thumbnail that is just a random picture of us from the panel, possibly blurry.

618
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:25,290
Rym: So I went back and I started just making nice thumbnails for everything.

619
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:30,290
Rym: And I'll link to the YouTube thread where they are because I want to get your comments, your thoughts.

620
00:37:30,371 --> 00:37:32,589
Rym: I'm just going to make a thumbnail for every video we got out there.

621
00:37:32,971 --> 00:37:35,870
Rym: And I'm probably going to start making thumbnails for regular old episodes of GeekNights.

622
00:37:36,031 --> 00:37:43,930
Rym: because if you use Adobe Creative Cloud and you don't know this, there is something we've been using for a while, but now we're using it more, Adobe Express.

623
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:46,850
Scott: I don't even think you need a Creative Cloud to use Adobe Express.

624
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:47,112
Scott: You don't.

625
00:37:47,132 --> 00:37:49,110
Rym: If you have a Creative Cloud account, you can do more.

626
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:50,309
Scott: I think it's just free.

627
00:37:50,831 --> 00:37:53,490
Rym: It has a lot of capabilities that are locked unless you pay.

628
00:37:55,272 --> 00:37:56,160
Rym: You might not need those.

629
00:37:56,341 --> 00:38:00,350
Rym: I ended up needing those because I'm doing a little more with this thing than you might.

630
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:13,129
Rym: But basically, if you have even like a one percent level of basic understanding of the kind of graphic design you like, you don't even have to be good at it.

631
00:38:13,492 --> 00:38:25,370
Rym: If you have the vaguest awareness of what you want something to look like, if you kind of just flail and click in Adobe Express, it'll make something that'll look better than anything you could have made using a regular old application.

632
00:38:25,572 --> 00:38:27,010
Rym: It'll kind of just look good.

633
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:44,108
Scott: Not only does it provide all these automatic design templates, but it also lets you do lots and lots of very simple but extremely common media operations, like resize an image, convert a video to a different format, crop a video, trim a video.

634
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:46,890
Rym: Do you want some of your text to be at an angle?

635
00:38:47,611 --> 00:38:48,728
Scott: Turn something into a PDF.

636
00:38:49,633 --> 00:38:59,270
Scott: All this stuff that you commonly do, that if you're not a skilled pro, it lets you do all those simple operations in a couple clicks.

637
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:00,970
Rym: And you don't have all the tools and all the precision.

638
00:39:01,832 --> 00:39:04,350
Rym: You can't even set all the angles exactly.

639
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:06,768
Rym: You can't make everything exactly the way you want it.

640
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:09,650
Rym: But if you know exactly what you want, don't fucking use Adobe Express.

641
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:11,030
Rym: Go use real applications.

642
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:17,729
Rym: But if you want to make a professional looking thing in two minutes, it's way good at that.

643
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:19,548
Rym: I'm just cranking these things out.

644
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:28,149
Scott: If you have no skills to make a professional looking thing, it's like, you know, if you have no skills, you get real Photoshop, you won't make a professional looking thing in 10 hours, right?

645
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:30,669
Scott: So that's what Adobe Express is for.

646
00:39:32,915 --> 00:39:43,730
Scott: The new GeekNights website is like, there's still a long list of things to do, but the list of things that are needed to do before launching is now suddenly short, real short.

647
00:39:44,151 --> 00:39:51,710
Scott: So we really just need to sort of take the fine tooth comb and go over the front end bits and then do some polishing.

648
00:39:52,591 --> 00:39:59,750
Scott: And then we could launch it, and then Rym could start making thumbnails and images for everything ever.

649
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:00,192
Rym: Yeah.

650
00:40:00,212 --> 00:40:01,160
Rym: Funny, funny.

651
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:06,290
Rym: Why did Rym suddenly make a pipeline to rapidly crank out GeekNights thumbnails?

652
00:40:06,471 --> 00:40:08,285
Rym: It's almost like everything's aligning.

653
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:18,729
Scott: But yeah, so that'll, you know, you can go to beta.frontrowcrew.com to see the kind of broken, but current version of it, you know.

654
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:20,449
Rym: Which actually gives me a vague idea.

655
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:22,250
Rym: I'm just curious, I'm going to put this out there.

656
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:23,868
Rym: I'll make a post in the forum and everywhere else too.

657
00:40:25,072 --> 00:40:29,620
Rym: I kind of want to throw a no host party just in Queens, like at a beer garden or something.

658
00:40:30,144 --> 00:40:31,130
Rym: once we launch the site.

659
00:40:31,474 --> 00:40:32,810
Rym: And if anyone shows up, they show up.

660
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:35,369
Rym: And if no one shows up, I'll just be there with like a few friends.

661
00:40:36,732 --> 00:40:38,369
Rym: Like an open invite party.

662
00:40:40,784 --> 00:40:44,580
Rym: Whenever we do this, whenever the launch happens or sometime thereabouts.

663
00:40:47,066 --> 00:40:48,199
Rym: One other little thing.

664
00:40:49,247 --> 00:40:49,919
Rym: So this is new.

665
00:40:51,223 --> 00:40:59,839
Rym: I have joined a team officially, and I'm going to be competing and running in the New York Marathon on November 5th at the end of this year.

666
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:02,760
Scott: Rym, don't run marathons, they're not good for you.

667
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:04,240
Scott: Also Rym runs marathons.

668
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:07,800
Rym: I'm going to run one marathon because I like running half marathons.

669
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,177
Rym: That's like the perfect distance of Alright, this is recorded.

670
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,011
Scott: So when Rym runs in the 2024 marathon.

671
00:41:18,127 --> 00:41:19,940
Rym: The thing about marathons, they're just too long.

672
00:41:20,923 --> 00:41:24,059
Rym: Two hours of running is about what I like to do.

673
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,284
Rym: Kind of like biking.

674
00:41:25,385 --> 00:41:27,216
Rym: I like biking 70 to 80 miles.

675
00:41:28,221 --> 00:41:36,499
Rym: I can bike 100 to 110 miles, but 70 miles is like the sweet spot of low effort, minimum effort, maximum reward.

676
00:41:37,002 --> 00:41:40,900
Rym: So similarly, a half marathon for me is like the minimum effort, maximum reward.

677
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:45,917
Rym: But I'm going to run in this once, and I'm doing it for charity because that's one of the only ways to get in.

678
00:41:46,762 --> 00:41:48,575
Rym: So what I'm going to say is I'm going to have a thing.

679
00:41:50,022 --> 00:41:51,007
Rym: I will fund this.

680
00:41:51,248 --> 00:41:53,340
Rym: I don't need people to give money to this thing.

681
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:57,220
Rym: The money all goes to cancer research at Sloan Kettering.

682
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:04,061
Rym: And I will match dollar for dollar up to the first $5,000.

683
00:42:04,061 --> 00:42:07,000
Rym: Anything, any of you, donate to this thing once it's up.

684
00:42:08,841 --> 00:42:18,740
Scott: There's a lot of bike rides I want to do that are charity only rides, but I don't want to do any fundraising because the minimum fundraising is always thousands of dollars.

685
00:42:19,061 --> 00:42:22,340
Rym: Oh yeah, I got to raise a ton of money for this, but I'm pretty confident I can.

686
00:42:22,701 --> 00:42:24,120
Scott: What if you fail to raise the money?

687
00:42:24,724 --> 00:42:26,840
Rym: Then I have to make up the difference in my own checkbook.

688
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,271
Scott: What if you just decide not to run?

689
00:42:28,291 --> 00:42:29,200
Scott: Can you just return all the money?

690
00:42:29,742 --> 00:42:34,280
Rym: Then I get kicked out of the race and all the money I raise still goes, but I would get kicked out of the New York Marathon.

691
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:35,502
Scott: Yeah, right?

692
00:42:35,522 --> 00:42:36,469
Scott: It's not easy.

693
00:42:38,701 --> 00:42:41,173
Rym: Well, I think I can raise $3,500 because I raised a lot of money.

694
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,420
Scott: That's lower than some of the bike ones I've seen.

695
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:50,860
Scott: I think it's because the bike ones are usually multi-day things that have hotels and have support groups and bike equipment.

696
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:56,000
Rym: I do work for a very big company that is covering most of what we need to raise.

697
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:56,624
Scott: Oh, okay.

698
00:42:56,644 --> 00:42:57,620
Scott: The company is covering most of it.

699
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,779
Rym: And is also matching on top of this.

700
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:11,640
Rym: So basically, this is a way for you out there to amplify your giving, because if you give here, it's going to get matched twice, but I'm going to personally match dollar for dollar up to the first $5,000.

701
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:14,380
Scott: But couldn't people just donate to something better?

702
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:17,860
Rym: I mean, cancer research at Sloan Kettering is not the worst thing.

703
00:43:18,483 --> 00:43:19,399
Scott: No, I didn't say it is.

704
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:21,780
Rym: I mean, granted, you know where that money should be coming from, taxes.

705
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:27,120
Scott: Yeah, they could donate to Scott's Beach Fund or whatever.

706
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:31,319
Scott: You know, just think about what you want to do with your money.

707
00:43:35,341 --> 00:43:43,420
Scott: Would you enjoy the world more if you helped cancer get solved and also helped Rym not be on the hook for spending?

708
00:43:44,062 --> 00:43:45,060
Scott: It's like, think about it this way.

709
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:49,460
Scott: If you don't donate, Rym is going to pay for it entirely out of his own wallet.

710
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,521
Rym: I'm going to make up the difference to $3,500.

711
00:43:52,521 --> 00:43:57,358
Rym: But if you all donate $5,000, I got to put in another $5,000, because I'm matching you.

712
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:10,980
Scott: So basically, your donation only matters if you collectively donate over $3,500 divided by two, because otherwise Rym is just going to pay that out of his own wallet.

713
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:11,498
Scott: That is true.

714
00:44:12,304 --> 00:44:12,538
Scott: Okay.

715
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:13,879
Rym: That is absolutely true.

716
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:16,200
Rym: I mean, really, this fits within.

717
00:44:17,463 --> 00:44:21,638
Scott: So either donate nothing, so Rym loses a lot of money, or donate a lot.

718
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:24,540
Rym: And then I'm out a bunch of money that I wouldn't otherwise be out.

719
00:44:24,601 --> 00:44:25,269
Rym: So that's the strategy.

720
00:44:27,442 --> 00:44:32,381
Scott: Whatever you don't want to do is donate exactly $1,750.

721
00:44:32,381 --> 00:44:34,980
Scott: That is the worst possible result.

722
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:35,658
Rym: I'll tell you what.

723
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:41,400
Rym: If we hit that number exactly, I'll just put five grand in, like on top.

724
00:44:42,261 --> 00:44:44,080
Scott: Okay, that cancels out any bad scenarios.

725
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:47,240
Rym: It cancels out the absolute worst case scenario in the middle.

726
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:54,742
Scott: You want to collectively organize yourselves to donate exactly $1,750.

727
00:44:54,742 --> 00:44:56,040
Rym: So yeah, I'm going to run a marathon.

728
00:44:56,321 --> 00:44:56,738
Rym: This should be fun.

729
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:59,579
Rym: But the hard mode is, so I signed up to join the team.

730
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:08,660
Rym: The next day, literally, literally, the next day at work, I learned that I will be in Singapore and Asia for like the two weeks before this.

731
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:17,440
Rym: So I'm going to speak at a conference, the next morning fly from Singapore to New York, and then the following day after that, run a marathon.

732
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:19,302
Scott: It's too bad.

733
00:45:19,342 --> 00:45:23,620
Scott: I can't bike the marathon at the same time people are running.

734
00:45:23,922 --> 00:45:26,000
Rym: You can bike it before, but not during.

735
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:32,819
Scott: Yeah, I've done that several times, but it's like if someone actually knows who's running, it's like I can bike next to them like Lil Mac.

736
00:45:34,464 --> 00:45:35,159
Scott: That's what I want to do.

737
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:41,298
Rym: I am going to post, at least for the duration of the marathon, I'm going to share my Google location publicly on the internet so everyone can see where I am.

738
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:46,600
Scott: You can see you take a subway or a taxi like all the other marathon runners.

739
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,572
Rym: Oh, rimran the marathon in an hour and 45 minutes, huh?

740
00:45:53,342 --> 00:45:55,939
Scott: Wait a minute, Scott's still biking and Rym's already at the finish line?

741
00:45:57,802 --> 00:45:59,877
Rym: All right, we should get to the main bit because we've been going on long here.

742
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,179
Scott: You haven't done a show in a while, that's what happens.

743
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:04,899
Rym: Yeah, actually we've already gone long enough where that could have been a whole show.

744
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,936
Scott: Well, there's not too much to say, but noise.

745
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:15,737
Rym: Noise from technology almost entirely in the modern era comes from the fans.

746
00:46:15,877 --> 00:46:17,080
Rym: that cool that technology.

747
00:46:17,261 --> 00:46:18,280
Scott: If you're talking about computers.

748
00:46:18,543 --> 00:46:20,300
Rym: Yeah, I'd say most technology.

749
00:46:20,961 --> 00:46:23,839
Rym: Maybe because we don't have a lot of time we restrict this to computer noise.

750
00:46:24,761 --> 00:46:25,135
Scott: I guess so.

751
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,139
Rym: I think that makes sense.

752
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:31,820
Rym: So computers, in the old days computers made more noise partly because fans were worse.

753
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:37,120
Scott: Oh no, computers in the olden days made so many fucking noises from all their moving parts, right?

754
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:38,320
Rym: Oh, you want to go all the way back.

755
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,079
Rym: Yeah, a lot of computers had relays.

756
00:46:40,721 --> 00:46:41,320
Scott: They had hard drives.

757
00:46:41,421 --> 00:46:43,359
Scott: You know how loud a five and a quarter floppy drive is?

758
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:47,019
Scott: Modems going dee dee dee dee dee dee dee.

759
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:47,542
Scott: Right?

760
00:46:47,562 --> 00:46:51,057
Scott: It's fucking, Jesus Christ, computers were loud AF, right?

761
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:58,017
Scott: And what saved us from all the loud noises was better motors, better moving parts, right?

762
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:04,120
Scott: You know, but mostly solid state technology to where we didn't need anything that moves, right?

763
00:47:04,785 --> 00:47:06,540
Scott: We finally replaced the magnetic hard drives.

764
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,259
Scott: At least we still have them for some reasons.

765
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,147
Rym: But magnetic hard drives, like nowadays.

766
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:12,940
Rym: I have a gigantic NAS like right there.

767
00:47:13,384 --> 00:47:14,779
Rym: And that thing makes a little bit of noise.

768
00:47:15,364 --> 00:47:16,434
Rym: Most of that noise is fans.

769
00:47:16,454 --> 00:47:22,500
Scott: The drives will- I'm upset that the hard drives I bought that were mega discount, they're noisier than the ones I had in there before.

770
00:47:22,921 --> 00:47:24,560
Scott: My NAS used to not bother me, now it bothers me.

771
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:33,000
Rym: Yeah, I bought really expensive drives and they are, you can only hear them if, frankly, all the computers in the room are off and you listen real hard.

772
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:34,752
Scott: Yeah, I think, you know.

773
00:47:35,278 --> 00:47:35,500
Scott: Anyway.

774
00:47:36,241 --> 00:47:43,660
Rym: Or every Friday for about an hour when it's syncing up to Amazon Glacier, it makes a little bit of noise when it's going full steam.

775
00:47:43,841 --> 00:47:46,480
Scott: I don't mind if it's making noise when it's doing something, right?

776
00:47:48,041 --> 00:47:55,960
Scott: These drives, these Seagate Ironwolves, the Western Digitals I had in there before, which were much smaller, they only made noise when there was activity.

777
00:47:56,220 --> 00:48:01,960
Scott: These new ones, they make this clicking noise all the time, even when it's idle.

778
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:07,540
Scott: Yeah, mine does not- mine doesn't even- And I go online and there's a million threads about it and no one has any answers.

779
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,240
Rym: Yeah, my drives make zero noise when they're not spun up.

780
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:15,080
Scott: And there are some people who have, you know, threads with answers, but their noise is not my noise.

781
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:23,840
Rym: In fact, my NAS, most of the times, unless I'm, like, doing a big project or I'm backing stuff up or a script is running, my NAS is idle and the drives are spun down.

782
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:29,755
Scott: My NAS, I would like it to go to sleep, I tried to enable the sleeping mode, and it just keeps waking the fuck up.

783
00:48:29,875 --> 00:48:37,700
Scott: and I tried to go- Synology has a whole website that's like, here's all the things to check to make sure your NAS doesn't wake up on its own when it doesn't need to.

784
00:48:38,122 --> 00:48:40,680
Scott: It just- I did every single thing on the list, it just keeps waking the fuck up.

785
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:48,996
Rym: This is like back in RIT when my computer kept fucking waking up because I couldn't disable Wake on LAN and there was a lot of Wake on LAN- I had Wake on LAN disabled and it still wakes up, so that's not it.

786
00:48:49,036 --> 00:48:49,539
Scott: It's something else.

787
00:48:51,202 --> 00:48:53,237
Scott: So- It's something else that's waking it up, I don't know.

788
00:48:53,860 --> 00:49:00,900
Rym: But the thing now, like, nowadays, modern computer, unless you're doing something crazy, you probably don't even need any magnetic disks.

789
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:05,840
Rym: Or maybe you have, like, one or two giant magnet disks, like, if you don't have external storage, like, that's fine.

790
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:13,740
Rym: But pretty much the only thing that makes noise in a modern computer, and even then, only if it's a computer that's either crappy or really good, is the cooling.

791
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:16,007
Rym: Like, the cooling is what makes noise in computers now.

792
00:49:16,548 --> 00:49:20,180
Rym: That era of computers making all those beeps and bloops and clicks and clacks is just gone.

793
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:21,338
Scott: Yep.

794
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:29,160
Rym: And, frankly, what it comes down to, honestly, if you want your computer to be quiet, you actually care about your computer being quiet.

795
00:49:29,581 --> 00:49:37,380
Rym: You either have to make a relatively low-powered computer, so you can make it passively cooled, like, just no fans, which is totally doable.

796
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:38,320
Scott: Or your iPhone, iPad.

797
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:42,900
Rym: Yeah, just give up on a computer altogether and just have tablets, you know, something like that.

798
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:51,080
Scott: And there are laptops that are, like, this MacBook Air, actually, is passively cooled, but, you know, you get something bigger, MacBook Pro, I'm pretty sure those have some kind of fan.

799
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:54,079
Rym: And even the Switch has a little fan in it that spins up if it gets too hot.

800
00:49:54,761 --> 00:49:56,445
Scott: Yep, I mean, you know, there's a lot of computers.

801
00:49:56,465 --> 00:50:03,180
Scott: They got a tiny fan, or they got some clever, like, the Mac Mini and the Mac Studio have, like, clever fans that are, you know.

802
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:18,160
Rym: But, in a computer, if a computer is powerful, like, you're listening to GeekNights, you probably are the kind of person who wants to own a workstation for some reason, then it comes down to buy the better fans, and I think that's it.

803
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,370
Scott: Bigger fans, better fans.

804
00:50:20,781 --> 00:50:30,060
Scott: If there's any situation in which you can get rid of fans and use, say, water or some other, you know, liquid cooling of some kind, right, then that's going to be quieter, right?

805
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:35,760
Scott: But if you have fans, what you want to do is you want to get bigger fans, right?

806
00:50:36,421 --> 00:50:54,300
Scott: If the fan is bigger, right, that, you know, millimeter-wise, like, larger blades, then that means with less RPMs, it can push more cubic centimeters, feet, whatever you measure volume, right, of air per unit time, right?

807
00:50:54,500 --> 00:51:02,160
Scott: So, with less spins, you can push the same amount of air as a smaller fan with more spins, and spins are what makes the noise.

808
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:11,220
Scott: A slow, a giant, giant, imagine a giant fan, right, like the size of your whole house that spins real slow, like a windmill, right?

809
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:16,620
Scott: It's like, that pushes so much air, but the blades are moving so slow, you don't hear anything.

810
00:51:17,141 --> 00:51:23,140
Scott: A tiny little fan to push that much air would have to spin like a jet engine, like, weeee, right?

811
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:28,200
Scott: And that so much spinning makes a lot of noise, so get bigger fans.

812
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:34,000
Rym: Yup, that's why my computer now has a 200 millimeter fan in the top, pulling air out.

813
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,468
Rym: That thing makes zero noise.

814
00:51:36,629 --> 00:51:39,260
Rym: I cannot hear it make noise under any circumstances.

815
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:42,560
Scott: Yeah, also by higher quality fans that have better bearings, you know.

816
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,516
Rym: Which, honestly, right now is Noctua, like...

817
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:48,900
Scott: Yes, Noctua has been on the top of the fan game brand-wise for quite a while.

818
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:55,320
Rym: I would not even consider another brand right now unless, like, multiple authorities told me otherwise.

819
00:51:55,580 --> 00:52:01,440
Scott: I mean, if I buy a case, and the case has fans in it already, I'm not gonna replace them unless they're noisy.

820
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:02,200
Scott: Yup.

821
00:52:02,221 --> 00:52:12,940
Rym: So, my case, when I bought it, one of the fans, the smallest fan that was in the back, it's only a 120 millimeter, it was actually noisy enough to where I replaced it with a Noctua.

822
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:14,021
Scott: Okay.

823
00:52:14,362 --> 00:52:23,340
Scott: But it's like, if there are spots in the computer case for extra fans, and there aren't fans there already, or if a fan is noisy and I'm gonna replace it, I'll just buy a Noctua.

824
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:30,500
Scott: And that's not to say that, like, yeah, maybe I could buy another brand of fan, like a Cooler Master or something, and it's probably just fine.

825
00:52:30,942 --> 00:52:33,820
Scott: But it's like, I know the Noctua is good, so why would I fuck around?

826
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:35,438
Rym: They're so quiet, but too...

827
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:44,600
Scott: I have them on my HDPC, I know they're good, there's no reason for me to mess around trying to experiment with other brands when I already found one that's good enough.

828
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:48,561
Rym: But a second reason to buy a Noctua, and Noctua does not pay us, this is... No.

829
00:52:48,643 --> 00:52:48,951
Rym: No one pays us.

830
00:52:49,361 --> 00:52:50,377
Rym: Does not take sponsorships.

831
00:52:51,601 --> 00:52:54,780
Rym: Though, if anyone wants to send us free stuff, by all means, as long as it's good and expensive.

832
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:55,638
Scott: Noctua, send me free fans.

833
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:56,536
Rym: Yeah, I take 'em.

834
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:57,858
Scott: I'm a big fan.

835
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:05,960
Rym: The second thing you can do, because the other source of noise from a fan is not just the spinning and the moving of the air, but it's the vibration noise.

836
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:19,320
Rym: And vibration noise from computers is currently the hardest noise to deal with, because one, it'll transfer along your floor, along your desk, it'll resonate around your room in surprising and difficult to track down ways.

837
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:26,040
Rym: And two, it is almost impossible to get rid of without making physical changes to your environment.

838
00:53:26,802 --> 00:53:35,520
Rym: The best way to prevent vibration noise from a computer is, one, your computer should be on rubberized feet of some kind.

839
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:37,419
Rym: Like dampeners of some kind.

840
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:43,440
Scott: And also where the fan attaches to the computer, a lot of times they'll be like little rubber bits.

841
00:53:45,743 --> 00:53:47,580
Scott: The Noctua's are rubbery in the corners.

842
00:53:48,081 --> 00:53:57,060
Rym: They're rubbery in the corner and they come with screws if you want to screw it in, but they also come with these clever little like long thin rubber bits that actually replace the screw.

843
00:53:57,561 --> 00:54:02,732
Rym: And if you put that in, that dampens the vibration and almost eliminates it as far as I can tell.

844
00:54:02,772 --> 00:54:06,260
Rym: Like I can't measure or hear the vibration noise from any rubber mounted fan.

845
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:11,460
Scott: Alright, so let's talk about some other parts of a modern computer that still make noise, right?

846
00:54:11,801 --> 00:54:15,332
Scott: We're not going to talk about the speakers, right?

847
00:54:15,533 --> 00:54:17,840
Scott: But we will talk about the beeper, right?

848
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:22,300
Scott: A lot of computers back in the day, the only audio they had was a beeper unless you bought a sound card.

849
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:27,280
Rym: The PC speaker is what it's officially called.

850
00:54:28,421 --> 00:54:28,681
Scott: Exactly.

851
00:54:28,802 --> 00:54:30,145
Scott: Even today, right?

852
00:54:31,088 --> 00:54:35,740
Scott: Even the newest computers, the motherboard still has a little four pin spot.

853
00:54:36,221 --> 00:54:45,140
Scott: You know, even though maybe not all the pins are used, where you can connect a speaker that's like the simplest electronic speaker that can basically only go beep boop.

854
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:48,080
Rym: It's a spec from 1981.

855
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,389
Scott: Yeah, and it's like it's still.

856
00:54:49,469 --> 00:54:50,939
Scott: that standard is still there today.

857
00:54:51,541 --> 00:54:56,800
Scott: And the only thing it's used for really on a modern computer is to beep when the computer turns on.

858
00:54:56,940 --> 00:55:00,680
Scott: So it's like it's like the single beep, like it confirms the motherboard is working.

859
00:55:00,881 --> 00:55:05,980
Rym: So my current computer did not have one on the motherboard and I did not install one and my computer cannot make noise.

860
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:06,543
Scott: Really?

861
00:55:06,563 --> 00:55:08,440
Scott: I've never seen a motherboard that didn't have the connector.

862
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:09,205
Scott: What?

863
00:55:09,386 --> 00:55:10,070
Rym: That's the connector.

864
00:55:10,251 --> 00:55:11,620
Rym: I just don't have a PC speaker.

865
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,160
Scott: Oh, well, yeah, you have to get your own.

866
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:14,810
Rym: Yeah, I didn't get one.

867
00:55:14,830 --> 00:55:15,398
Rym: I didn't plug it in.

868
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:23,180
Scott: You also, it can beep sometimes error codes if there's problems with the motherboard, right?

869
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:27,420
Scott: Because it's like, you know, the computer only has so many outputs, right?

870
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:33,661
Scott: And they're not expecting you to like connect a serial, you know, terminal to your computer in the year 2023.

871
00:55:33,661 --> 00:55:38,840
Scott: So if the display isn't working, then it needs a way to communicate with you that there's a problem.

872
00:55:39,501 --> 00:55:48,620
Scott: And some motherboards these days, at least fancy good ones, have like a little tiny LCD, like, you know, like seven, you know, sector, whatever you call it.

873
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:49,623
Rym: Yeah, they can show you.

874
00:55:49,683 --> 00:55:55,220
Rym: they can show you a code that you can type into Google and find someone else looking at your motherboard instruction manual.

875
00:55:56,081 --> 00:55:58,680
Scott: But the beep is the is usually the signal, right?

876
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:03,960
Scott: If you turn your computer on and it goes beep, beep, beep, it's like, you know, you got a problem.

877
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:06,780
Scott: You know, as long as it goes beep, then you know, it's good.

878
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:08,580
Scott: Any other beep bad, right?

879
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:12,137
Scott: But if there were if you didn't have the speaker, you would miss out on that.

880
00:56:12,157 --> 00:56:12,760
Scott: beep, beep, beep.

881
00:56:13,021 --> 00:56:15,113
Scott: And you might be like, why is my computer not turning on?

882
00:56:15,133 --> 00:56:16,078
Scott: Uh oh.

883
00:56:17,761 --> 00:56:19,837
Scott: And you need to find a PC speaker to figure that out.

884
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:27,640
Rym: Thankfully, that really unless you buy dodgy brands or get really unlucky, that is not much of a thing anymore with computers.

885
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:32,800
Scott: It's pretty rare, but it's still a thing, you know, and it's only matters like when you first put together your computer.

886
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:33,241
Scott: Yeah.

887
00:56:33,643 --> 00:56:37,320
Scott: And that's something really weird happens, like a hardware failure at some point down the road.

888
00:56:38,421 --> 00:56:43,560
Rym: And fun fact, PC speakers, all they can do is produce a two level square wave.

889
00:56:44,426 --> 00:56:44,997
Scott: Yep, that's it.

890
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:45,957
Rym: That's all they can do.

891
00:56:47,601 --> 00:56:55,520
Scott: The final part of computers that makes noise, at least in the present day, is keyboards and sometimes mice.

892
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:56,478
Scott: Those are moving parts.

893
00:56:57,220 --> 00:57:00,499
Scott: And some people like Rym get one that's intentionally clicky, clicky, clicky.

894
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:08,700
Rym: And I got one that's a little bit clicky, clicky, but not as much as I have one that's less clicky at work and one that's full clicky at home for typing pleasantly.

895
00:57:09,541 --> 00:57:15,520
Scott: Now, on the one hand, the clickiness right is can be very annoying to other people.

896
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:23,280
Rym: And I will admit straight away, if I could get the exact feel of a Cherry MX Blue, but it was silent, I would pay a lot of money for that.

897
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:26,600
Scott: I mean, there are ones that are the same feel, but closer.

898
00:57:27,384 --> 00:57:30,740
Rym: They're not if it was silent, but it felt the same.

899
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:38,560
Scott: Anyway, the point is, is that, you know, it might be annoying to other people, especially like misophonia people and whatnot.

900
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:38,900
Scott: Right.

901
00:57:39,422 --> 00:57:44,800
Scott: But for the person using the computer, the typing person, you know, I don't know if this is true or not.

902
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:48,920
Scott: But I feel like, you know, the click is a is, you know, positive feedback.

903
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,600
Scott: I don't get annoyed if I'm typing on a clicky keyboard.

904
00:57:52,888 --> 00:57:54,299
Scott: I get annoyed if someone else is.

905
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:54,622
Scott: Right.

906
00:57:54,642 --> 00:57:56,240
Scott: It's like, you know, you like iPhones.

907
00:57:56,460 --> 00:58:04,277
Scott: They even have virtual clicking noises, you know, for the keyboard that you can disable if you want, because it sort of gives you some feedback like audibly.

908
00:58:04,317 --> 00:58:05,660
Scott: that like, you know, you've pressed it.

909
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:06,041
Scott: Right.

910
00:58:07,428 --> 00:58:09,680
Scott: Which I guess is even more helpful on the iPhone keyboard.

911
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:12,959
Scott: You can't really feel it, though they do have some haptic features as well.

912
00:58:14,181 --> 00:58:18,540
Scott: And mice also click when you click the buttons or make noises when you scroll the wheel.

913
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:20,640
Scott: Thankfully, the ball is gone.

914
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:21,480
Scott: That doesn't make noise.

915
00:58:23,081 --> 00:58:25,120
Scott: But those noises, how useful are they?

916
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:25,991
Scott: They're pretty quiet.

917
00:58:26,112 --> 00:58:26,498
Scott: No, I don't.

918
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:27,858
Scott: You know, but they're still there.

919
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:33,740
Scott: There's still some sort of positive feedback noise that wouldn't be the same, really.

920
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:42,220
Scott: If like, you know, you like imagine if your keyboard was silent, like in your headphones, it was like the iPhone where it was like simulating keyboard noises.

921
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:46,259
Rym: I guess there is one last worthwhile thing to talk about.

922
00:58:47,381 --> 00:58:56,520
Rym: If it is possible to make computers like even extremely powerful computers effectively nearly silent, why are server rooms so loud?

923
00:58:57,421 --> 00:59:08,020
Rym: And the answer is one, noise is not like other than that weird edge case of magnetic drives actually do perform worse when it is loud around them.

924
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:09,077
Rym: Like that's a thing.

925
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:15,172
Rym: But magnetic drives are increasingly not used in data centers, or at least if they are, they're used in separate areas where the disks are.

926
00:59:15,232 --> 00:59:18,720
Rym: because data centers have evolved a lot since the last time any of us talked about them.

927
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:22,720
Rym: But two, because other than that, like no one cares about the noise.

928
00:59:23,222 --> 00:59:27,340
Rym: So you want what you care about is power usage, form factor.

929
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:34,920
Rym: The fact that they're so loud is kind of is part of just the trade off of all the other things that are way more important in a data center.

930
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:36,719
Rym: But it mostly comes down to noise.

931
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:41,760
Scott: The noise is only a problem if there are humans there to hear it and be bothered by it.

932
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:43,700
Scott: Now, there could be other problems with the noise.

933
00:59:43,821 --> 00:59:46,039
Scott: Maybe you've put your computer in some animal habitat.

934
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:52,560
Scott: It's bothering the animals or I mean, I used to work in the vibrations from the noise or disturbing a fault and causing earthquakes.

935
00:59:52,901 --> 00:59:59,180
Rym: I had to wear ear protection when I went into the data center and you literally could not talk to a human being in there.

936
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:04,360
Rym: It was impossible even next to someone to have a conversation without screaming at each other.

937
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:07,840
Rym: So that did present a challenging work environment.

938
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:20,220
Rym: Like if we're in there and something like we're failing to solve a problem, we might have to leave the data center and go to a quiet room to discuss what we're going to do and then go back into the data center and try to execute on what we discussed.

939
01:00:21,042 --> 01:00:22,511
Scott: Yeah, I mean, but that's not.

940
01:00:22,672 --> 01:00:24,040
Scott: how often is that happening, right?

941
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:24,400
Scott: Yeah.

942
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:30,300
Scott: You know, when computers are not operating near people to be annoyed by them, the noise doesn't matter.

943
01:00:30,381 --> 01:00:33,300
Scott: And that goes back to me complaining about my NAS, right?

944
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:35,519
Scott: Making noise now with these different hard drives in it.

945
01:00:36,181 --> 01:00:39,620
Scott: A lot of the threads, people are just like, who cares?

946
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:40,680
Scott: Shove your NAS in a closet.

947
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:41,239
Scott: It won't matter.

948
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:41,431
Scott: Yep.

949
01:00:42,006 --> 01:00:42,739
Scott: Then you can't hear it.

950
01:00:42,883 --> 01:00:43,420
Scott: That is the solution.

951
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:44,259
Scott: I really wish I could.

952
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:45,296
Scott: I wish I could.

953
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:45,832
Scott: Right?

954
01:00:46,362 --> 01:00:49,620
Scott: The layout of my tiny apartment and where the network cables are.

955
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:50,357
Scott: I can't do that.

956
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:57,420
Rym: So yeah, if I could get away with it, I'd love to mount my computer in its own cool environment or something, but I ain't got time for that.

957
01:00:58,240 --> 01:00:58,340
Scott: Yeah.

958
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,700
Scott: Like if I had a house, I just put the NAS in the basement.

959
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:01,093
Scott: Yep.

960
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:05,080
Rym: But the other reason they're like this is very simple.

961
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:06,527
Rym: A lot of servers are one or two.

962
01:01:06,547 --> 01:01:08,800
Rym: you like they're small, they're compact.

963
01:01:09,321 --> 01:01:13,980
Rym: So they have to move a terrifying volume of air through themselves for cooling.

964
01:01:14,381 --> 01:01:22,240
Rym: So they have like, if you've ever opened a 1U server that has fans in it, they have these little like one inch diameter fans.

965
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:25,640
Rym: And sometimes you have like five of them in a row, like in serial.

966
01:01:27,182 --> 01:01:28,960
Rym: They whine like a demon being murdered.

967
01:01:29,521 --> 01:01:38,840
Scott: If you go on Google image search and just type like 1U server inside, you can see like the two, there'll be like some tiny fans in the back.

968
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:42,060
Scott: And a lot of times like they'll stack the fans up on top of each other.

969
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:42,205
Scott: Yep.

970
01:01:42,521 --> 01:01:44,140
Scott: Like in a row or in series.

971
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:52,220
Rym: So my advice to you, because when I was young, I got a 1U server once from work and I actually ended up scrapping it.

972
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:58,300
Rym: A lot of nerds think it'd be really cool to have like a rack in your basement, like a quarter rack to stick your switch in.

973
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:02,400
Rym: If you get an old server to run some services, my advice to you is never do it.

974
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:07,379
Rym: Because if you live in a house, even a big house that has a basement and you put it in a basement.

975
01:02:08,821 --> 01:02:16,360
Rym: Rack mounted servers, because of the kinds of fans they use, they don't make the lower pitch noise that you think computers make.

976
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:18,460
Rym: They make very high pitch noises.

977
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:25,880
Rym: And I will tell you now, you could be on the second story of your house and you have a nerd rack in a closet in your basement.

978
01:02:26,522 --> 01:02:30,180
Rym: And you will hear that fucking rack on the second story of your house.

979
01:02:30,402 --> 01:02:31,759
Rym: You will not be able to unhear it.

980
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:40,020
Rym: There is no way to dampen that noise in a house that is reasonable, feasible, and plausible to execute on.

981
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:42,109
Scott: I'm looking at a picture.

982
01:02:42,170 --> 01:02:43,699
Scott: This is the most impressive one so far.

983
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:45,323
Scott: The Dell PowerEdge R620.

984
01:02:45,543 --> 01:02:47,128
Scott: It's 8x2.5" single processor 1U server, right?

985
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:55,840
Scott: And the fans are basically the front of the server, right?

986
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:59,120
Scott: With all the, you know, the front where you can insert all the drive.

987
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:00,138
Scott: Oh, look at those little fans!

988
01:03:00,802 --> 01:03:03,629
Scott: Right, and then there are seven sets of fans.

989
01:03:03,810 --> 01:03:07,420
Scott: Each set has two fans, one in front of the other, right?

990
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:11,320
Scott: And they're basically separating the front of the case from the back of the case.

991
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:16,960
Scott: They're blowing straight across their, I guess, parallel with the RAM sticks.

992
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:20,120
Scott: So basically all the, you know, the RAM sticks like fins.

993
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:23,600
Rym: Also I love that this server, look at how many fucking DIMMs there are there.

994
01:03:24,461 --> 01:03:30,380
Scott: Right, it's like a shit ton of RAM sticks and all these fans just lined up and like they're double fans, one in front of the other.

995
01:03:31,282 --> 01:03:34,579
Scott: The front fan is actually like a big thick one and then a thinner one.

996
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:37,608
Scott: And then they're all blowing straight across.

997
01:03:37,749 --> 01:03:39,074
Scott: It's like that thing is loud.

998
01:03:39,094 --> 01:03:40,720
Scott: You can just tell looking at it how loud that is.

999
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:42,483
Rym: I can hear it just looking at it.

1000
01:03:42,543 --> 01:03:50,840
Rym: Not only are the fans loud, the noise of the air itself moving will be loud because it's moving through such a complex and constricted space.

1001
01:03:52,384 --> 01:03:55,199
Rym: And then you've got a rack, you've got like 20 of these things stacked end over end.

1002
01:03:55,860 --> 01:04:04,740
Rym: So 20 times 7 times 2 screaming fans in one rack, not counting the power supplies at the top or the switches and the routers that are even louder.

1003
01:04:06,663 --> 01:04:08,419
Rym: Yeah, if you've never worked in a data center, don't.

1004
01:04:10,781 --> 01:04:13,969
Scott: And you know, if noises don't bother you, that's great.

1005
01:04:14,210 --> 01:04:18,040
Scott: And if they do bother you, make your computer quieter or put it somewhere else.

1006
01:04:18,622 --> 01:04:24,320
Rym: I put quiet above performance very pointedly my entire life and I will continue to do so.

1007
01:04:24,761 --> 01:04:30,240
Scott: I mean, like I said before, I can tolerate noise as long as the noise is accompanying a purpose.

1008
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:32,140
Scott: Like if I start playing a game.

1009
01:04:32,180 --> 01:04:38,000
Rym: Oh yeah, if I spin up like Overwatch or something and then like my video card starts going like that's fine.

1010
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:43,280
Scott: If I start working my computer and the GPU goes whoosh, then it's like, ah, OK, that's fine.

1011
01:04:43,341 --> 01:04:45,660
Scott: But if it's doing that all the time, that's not fine.

1012
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:48,871
Rym: Got an HDPC that's well, there is one problem.

1013
01:04:49,413 --> 01:04:51,240
Rym: HDPC totally quiet when you're not using it.

1014
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:54,675
Rym: You watch a 4K movie and all the fans spin up and it makes noise.

1015
01:04:54,917 --> 01:04:55,580
Rym: That's no bueno.

1016
01:05:01,730 --> 01:05:03,830
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1017
01:05:04,030 --> 01:05:08,950
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1018
01:05:09,350 --> 01:05:14,370
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

1019
01:05:14,611 --> 01:05:17,290
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1020
01:05:17,550 --> 01:05:22,050
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1021
01:05:22,410 --> 01:05:25,566
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1022
01:05:26,870 --> 01:05:29,810
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1023
01:05:30,110 --> 01:05:32,990
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1024
01:05:33,390 --> 01:05:52,170
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights are Alan Joyce, Link Iggi, Jirad Lilly, Tenebrae Case, Karen Makes Music, Chris Adad, Clinton Walton, Dex, Finn, Joel Hayes, Penny Rymer, Rebecca Dunn, Sam Erickson, Shervin Von Horrell and a bunch of people who don't want me to say their names because they were giving an appropriate amount of money, which is like a dollar.

1025
01:05:53,150 --> 01:05:59,890
Rym: But yeah, remember the Patreon is mostly here, at least for the immediate future, as a nice backup to GeekNights because it is free.

1026
01:06:00,452 --> 01:06:01,668
Rym: I still make all the posts free.

1027
01:06:02,911 --> 01:06:07,770
Rym: But stay tuned for some Patreon specific content that will be appearing in the near future.

1028
01:06:08,150 --> 01:06:11,690
Rym: But we'll talk about that when it actually happens because we got to get the website live first.
