1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,790
Rym: It's Tuesday, May 19th, 2020.

2
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:09,991
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,022 --> 00:00:12,397
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,209
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,249 --> 00:00:15,740
Rym: Tonight, we go further.

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,260
Rym: We're talking about Rolling Stock.

7
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,360
Rym: A card game about stock and company trading.

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,239
Rym: Orthogonally adjacent to train games.

9
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,096
Scott: Let's do this.

10
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:36,079
Rym: So traditionally, during normal times, GeekNights, like the beginning of the show, tends to turn into Bike Nights because we bike a lot in the summer.

11
00:00:37,523 --> 00:00:38,231
Rym: And here we go again.

12
00:00:38,251 --> 00:00:39,160
Rym: I was biking over the weekend.

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,600
Rym: I actually finally went up to that South County Trail and wanted to see sort of just riding on it.

14
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,400
Scott: It looked to me like you went on the Croton Aqueduct Trail and not on the County Trail.

15
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,420
Rym: I mean the Croton Aqueduct Trail is really short and we used that to get to the South County Trail.

16
00:00:52,681 --> 00:01:02,079
Scott: No, I looked at your Strava and you went onto the Croton Aqueduct Trail, which is quite long and continues very far north.

17
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:02,882
Rym: Yep.

18
00:01:02,903 --> 00:01:04,319
Rym: Paved the whole way we were riding on.

19
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,419
Rym: There's only one tiny segment that was not paved.

20
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:13,640
Scott: Yeah, but yeah, no, the County Trailway, I saw on your Strava you turned left, which is Croton Aqueduct.

21
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:19,280
Scott: If the County Trailway goes only north and more east, you made the sharp left turn.

22
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,160
Scott: But either way, yeah, there's all kinds of awesome trails up there.

23
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,620
Rym: Yeah, we followed it all the way north.

24
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,237
Rym: We were going to go all the way to Tarrytown, but then we just headed back because we didn't start early enough for having enough food on us.

25
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,680
Scott: Yeah, that's always the problem, right?

26
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:43,320
Scott: It's like I used to be able to just go all the way up to Brewster and take the train home and stop and eat food at places on the way and pee at places on the way, but now without all those places and, you know, train, questionable, right?

27
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,099
Rym: Well, just bring your own food and pee in the woods.

28
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:52,052
Scott: Yeah, but then the problem is it's still, even if I do that, let's say I get to Brewster, 60 miles north.

29
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:54,699
Rym: And bike 60 more miles back south?

30
00:01:55,224 --> 00:01:55,395
Scott: Yeah.

31
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,740
Rym: Or just stick a tent in your panniers and just pop the tent up and sleep tonight.

32
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,238
Scott: There's nowhere to put a tent in Brewster, first of all.

33
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,840
Rym: Just put it on the trail, side of the road.

34
00:02:04,901 --> 00:02:06,979
Scott: Yeah, it's not like that, side of the road.

35
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,217
Rym: Just put it in a Walmart parking lot.

36
00:02:09,091 --> 00:02:09,280
Rym: Sure.

37
00:02:09,341 --> 00:02:10,299
Rym: I doubt anyone will hassle you.

38
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,959
Scott: I don't even think there's a Walmart up there.

39
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,080
Scott: It's such a sad place.

40
00:02:14,262 --> 00:02:24,160
Scott: But yeah, it's like getting home, even if I can physically get home, which I probably could, it's not, you know, it takes way long to get home, right?

41
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,680
Scott: It's like that's two days of biking almost in one day.

42
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:35,160
Rym: But the funniest thing is there's that section of the trail that's not finished yet, like it's not paved, so there's no way, like there's no good way to get across it.

43
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,060
Rym: Like there's a route around it and it's a fine road route.

44
00:02:38,642 --> 00:02:41,500
Rym: Or there's a really direct way, which is a wooded trail.

45
00:02:42,501 --> 00:02:55,500
Rym: We passed two road bikers who were clearly trying to get to the nice paved bike trail and clearly could not ride their road bikes on the non-paved dirt trail and were basically just walking their bikes along it until they got to the end about a mile and a half.

46
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:11,620
Scott: Right, well in Van Cortlandt Park, there is the old Putnam Trail, which as soon as you exit Van Cortlandt Park to the north becomes the county trailway, and then it's also the Croton whatever which sort of splits off to the left somewhere and, you know, the golf course is further north.

47
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:21,780
Scott: But yeah, the old Putnam Trail in the park is basically mud and they're currently repaving it, but obviously that repaving I think is now behind schedule.

48
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,380
Scott: Well the repaving is now-- Last I heard, it was not open yet.

49
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,365
Rym: Well it's not rideable.

50
00:03:26,445 --> 00:03:32,640
Rym: It's basically they've put the packed rock and foundation down but they haven't paved anything, so it's worse than just mud or dirt.

51
00:03:32,841 --> 00:03:33,919
Rym: It's not rideable at all.

52
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,260
Scott: Yeah, I've ridden through it on a road bike in the mud, which is already unpleasant.

53
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,299
Scott: But yeah, right now I would just take the route around the park and enter the--.

54
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:51,500
Scott: There's a spot you can enter the trailway this north of the park, like in Yonkers, at this cul-de-sac-y, dead-end-y kind of spot.

55
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:56,919
Rym: Yeah, there's a lot of entries to that whole trail system, just like at a random dead-end street in a suburban-looking town.

56
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,300
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know, once you start getting like further north, it's like the trail just goes straight through.

57
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,888
Scott: I think it's Yorktown Heights.

58
00:04:05,029 --> 00:04:09,280
Scott: It basically goes right through the middle of the town, like right next to the playground and people's houses.

59
00:04:10,362 --> 00:04:18,100
Scott: And then I think even further north, it's like the way it sort of goes is like you'll be in the woods and then you'll pop out and you'll have to like cross some street.

60
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,380
Scott: That's like some street.

61
00:04:20,341 --> 00:04:26,480
Scott: It's like it's not necessarily all 100% in the woods, even though you're clearly on a trail.

62
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,580
Scott: It's like on one side of the street, it's like there's a stick in the middle.

63
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,538
Scott: It's like one of those kind of situations to prevent cars from getting in.

64
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:40,980
Rym: On the other side, just in the Bronx, there's a lot of-- And it's like Sprain Brook, there's all these good bikeways.

65
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,440
Rym: But even then, you'll go for a while and then it's all right.

66
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:49,100
Rym: You just have to brave running across the freeway really quick and then you can continue on the trail.

67
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,505
Scott: There's only one spot.

68
00:04:50,645 --> 00:04:55,000
Scott: I know if you take the county trail way correctly that you have to run across the freeway-ish.

69
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,940
Rym: That's if you go more east like toward Pelham Bay Park and then you head north from there.

70
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,652
Scott: Oh, you're talking about over there.

71
00:05:00,713 --> 00:05:11,940
Scott: I'm saying-- I'm talking about like in the Bronx-- On the county trail way, there's a point at which you're on Route 100 and you're supposed to be biking in the shoulder of Route 100, which is fine, right?

72
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:16,619
Scott: It's not a super much used highway, but it is definitely a highway, right?

73
00:05:17,723 --> 00:05:19,999
Scott: And there's one spot where you got to cross it.

74
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,477
Scott: And the way you cross it is sort of across--.

75
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,799
Scott: No, there's a crosswalk, kind of.

76
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:32,020
Scott: And then there's a ramp, so like you're standing on the edge of this highway, the ramp, and you're waiting.

77
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,940
Scott: And it's like you sort of look, and as long as no cars are coming around, you go for it.

78
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,340
Scott: And now you're on the opposite shoulder.

79
00:05:39,384 --> 00:05:40,419
Scott: That's how you're supposed to use it.

80
00:05:41,102 --> 00:05:42,739
Scott: So anyway, it's a little sketchy.

81
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,879
Rym: Tuesday, we talk about things other than biking.

82
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,399
Rym: We actually are doing stuff, so you got any news?

83
00:05:49,629 --> 00:05:50,100
Rym: I got a ton.

84
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,580
Scott: There's a ton of news, but I sent you all the newses, and now I forget which ones we sent.

85
00:05:53,921 --> 00:06:02,440
Rym: All right, what I'll start with is, obviously since cons are shutting down and everything's trouble, Evo 2020 is going to be Evo Online 2020.

86
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,032
Rym: Not Evo Online, but Evo.

87
00:06:04,052 --> 00:06:05,020
Rym: Biting games.

88
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:12,260
Scott: Yeah, the fighting game, you know, effectively fighting game world championships, which I think is what Evo counts as now, basically.

89
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,520
Rym: Basically, this is like the Super Bowl World Series of fighting games.

90
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:21,000
Scott: Right, and every year they have the Evo tournament, and it includes many different fighting games.

91
00:06:21,843 --> 00:06:24,000
Scott: And there's a different slate of fighting games every time.

92
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,717
Rym: And if you win any one of these tournaments, that's real.

93
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:29,719
Rym: You are a world champion, no one's going to dispute that.

94
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:30,751
Scott: No.

95
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:43,580
Scott: The thing is, this year, because it's going online, they had to remove some games that could not be played online, and they added some games that could be played online.

96
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:54,220
Scott: Of course, even the best fighting games, their online netcode, the latency matters a lot in a fighting game, down to the fractions of a second.

97
00:06:54,640 --> 00:07:02,640
Scott: So there is some questionable things with regards to how legit is this.

98
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,040
Scott: Would the result have been the same if they played in person?

99
00:07:05,901 --> 00:07:13,820
Scott: But the results are still fair, because everyone's playing online with the same conditions, as though some people may have better internet than others, and that's just sort of a shame.

100
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:23,880
Rym: Yeah, but at the same time, that's very similar to if someone in lower tier sports has better equipment, better bike, better skis, that happens.

101
00:07:25,401 --> 00:07:25,898
Scott: Yeah, maybe.

102
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:33,579
Rym: But yeah, so they've added a bunch of games, they've changed some stuff around, some stuff like Samurai Showdown, Soulcalibur 6, that's all in there.

103
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:44,799
Rym: But they added some open tournaments for games that were not originally going to be part of the lineup, Killer Instinct, Mortal Kombat 11, which I'm hearing good things about, I should try it.

104
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,638
Scott: Yeah, go ahead, do that.

105
00:07:47,021 --> 00:07:48,239
Rym: I mean, it looks fun, people are liking it.

106
00:07:48,700 --> 00:08:00,979
Rym: Skullgirls 2nd Encore, and Bems Fightin' Herds, the bootleg pony game that got shut down for copyright, and then Lauren Faust actually helped them change the character designs so they could still make the game, because the game was good.

107
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,110
Scott: Yep.

108
00:08:03,641 --> 00:08:09,920
Rym: But, in all our discussion, the thing we're beating around the bush, the buried lead, notice I didn't say anything about Smash Brothers.

109
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,960
Scott: No, so Smash Brothers, you know, is a pretty new Smash Brothers game out these days.

110
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:20,540
Rym: Yeah, I hear the community around Smash Brothers is very fervent, very dedicated, very serious.

111
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,039
Scott: Yeah, you don't say.

112
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:27,300
Scott: But anyway, the point is, Smash Brothers, right, online, everyone knows it sucks.

113
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,620
Rym: But it sucks for like ten different reasons.

114
00:08:30,401 --> 00:08:33,559
Scott: No, it sucks for pretty much one reason, is that Nintendo Online sucks.

115
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:42,520
Rym: Yes, but the two reasons are, the netcode is bad, like it doesn't work, even if you get it to work and play online, like, lag is a weird problem, but secondarily...

116
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,600
Scott: That's just Nintendo Online sucks, okay, what else?

117
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:55,420
Rym: Well, no, I'm saying that the technology of Nintendo Online sucks, and independently of that, the interface and structure of Nintendo Online sucks, like how it works from the user experience, even if the netcode were perfect.

118
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:02,800
Rym: Really hard to like... I just read, there's a big article talking about all the problems of doing online Smash tournaments, like it's really hard.

119
00:09:02,981 --> 00:09:07,760
Scott: If there wasn't any weird, you know, netcode problems, you could hold a Smash tournament online.

120
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:16,740
Rym: Apparently people who try have said that it's actually a big problem, it's hard to get the right players to join the matches at the right times, things like notifications just don't go out, things are inconsistent.

121
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,040
Scott: Why are notifications, notifications should be sent outside the game?

122
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,600
Rym: Because they're trying to invite someone to, like, the match to make it happen, and it just doesn't work.

123
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:31,920
Rym: I've never tried to play it online, because I never had Nintendo Online, nor would I ever, ever play Smash Brothers online with anyone.

124
00:09:32,221 --> 00:09:37,260
Scott: No, I would not play Smash Brothers online, but yeah, I'm pretty sure that all those problems are just under the umbrella of Nintendo Online sucks.

125
00:09:38,361 --> 00:09:49,879
Scott: You have to pay $20 a year for it, or in our case, cheat and get a family plan, and get a ton of people into it to pay way less than, because it's not worth even really that much money at all.

126
00:09:51,001 --> 00:09:56,160
Rym: In fact, once the Animal Crossing train dies down, I'd probably stop even paying for the family plan, because that's literally the only gain.

127
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,539
Scott: You didn't even pay me for the family plan.

128
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,640
Rym: Oh yeah, I guess I should.

129
00:09:59,941 --> 00:10:03,218
Scott: But you get, you know, you do get your Tetris 99, you should try that out.

130
00:10:04,321 --> 00:10:06,700
Scott: And you get some NES and SNES games you can play.

131
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,840
Rym: Oh, you mean the SNES and NES games that I already have on a really good emulator?

132
00:10:10,922 --> 00:10:12,360
Scott: You do, but you can play them on the Switch.

133
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:19,480
Rym: Oh yeah, maybe if I had to go somewhere and needed to play that, and I didn't have access to my laptop, or I couldn't even go anywhere.

134
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:27,000
Scott: Yeah, you can play Super Metroid, like, on a plane, within your hands, without a laptop on the little table, you know, slightly more convenient.

135
00:10:27,362 --> 00:10:27,451
Rym: Yeah?

136
00:10:27,942 --> 00:10:31,500
Rym: Or I could just put my little laptop on there and have the emulator, and it'll just work.

137
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,420
Scott: Slightly, slightly less convenient.

138
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:35,079
Rym: Yeah, but I'm bringing my laptop anyway.

139
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:38,513
Scott: Bring a Switch anyway.

140
00:10:38,757 --> 00:10:38,980
Scott: Anyway.

141
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:50,900
Rym: But the funniest thing about all this is, the Smash Brothers fandom is pretty known for pretending Smash has zero problems, and being mad when people call those problems out.

142
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,806
Scott: You say this, but I haven't seen any people saying that.

143
00:10:53,846 --> 00:10:59,860
Scott: Most of the people I've seen talking about this are pretty much just like, "Yes, we all know that Nintendo Online sucks, serves Nintendo

144
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,040
Scott: right.".

145
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:06,720
Rym: Did you look at the Twitter thread that followed from the announcement of Evo Online?

146
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:10,076
Rym: Because it starts with people being excited, like, "Yay, something's gonna

147
00:11:10,117 --> 00:11:10,378
Rym: happen!".

148
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:16,919
Rym: And then there's this long string of people who are talking about their excitement for the Smash Tournament part of it.

149
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:27,860
Rym: People didn't notice for a while that Smash wasn't removed from the lineup, because Evo didn't make a big deal about removing Smash, nor will they give any official reason as to why they removed it.

150
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:32,360
Scott: They won't say, they're just- Why don't they make the official- why don't they do- come on, that's cowardly.

151
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:36,540
Scott: They specifically have not- They are specifically not including Smash because this internet sucks.

152
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:47,059
Rym: Yep, they pointedly- Did not say anything about it, and refused to say anything about it, at least as of, like, Dateline 6pm Eastern Time on the 19th.

153
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:48,977
Scott: Cowards boo.

154
00:11:49,120 --> 00:12:01,980
Rym: Now, what's funny is that every single article about this on every single site I found says the same thing, which says, basically, they didn't say why, but we're assuming it's because of the terrible netcode, and the fact that Nintendo Online basically doesn't work.

155
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,458
Scott: Pretty much, yeah.

156
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:26,300
Rym: But, at the same time, there is a sort of broader problem that fighting games in particular, just by the nature of how they tend to be, have a lot more problems with netcode than, like, FPSs, because as precise as FPSs need to be, there's a lot of reasons why they're actually pretty tolerant of high lag and non-deterministic latency in a way that a lot of fighting games just really aren't.

157
00:12:27,003 --> 00:12:29,718
Scott: No, because a fighting game is literally about speed, right?

158
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:30,639
Scott: Yup, frame timing.

159
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:42,140
Scott: And the games are fast, and even the lag introduced by, like, an LCD TV is a problem, and they have to often play with CRTs to get, you know, no lag and high enough frame rates.

160
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:48,880
Rym: And, like, pros are reacting to near-frame perfect timing cues to then make near-frame perfect inputs.

161
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,906
Scott: Games also, you know, demand frame perfect inputs.

162
00:12:51,966 --> 00:12:53,590
Scott: It's like, "Oh, you want to block that attack?

163
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:58,179
Scott: You better push this button on this exact frame of this animation, otherwise it won't block, you'll get

164
00:12:58,219 --> 00:12:58,340
Scott: hit.".

165
00:12:58,701 --> 00:13:01,520
Scott: And the pros, they're the pros because they can do it, right?

166
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:01,954
Scott: Yup.

167
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:10,220
Scott: So then they need to be in a situation where, yeah, they can do it, but to do it, there has to be no lag, otherwise they're going to push the button too early or too late.

168
00:13:10,781 --> 00:13:29,420
Rym: Yup, but I'm just wondering in the long run, as there's more and more online tournaments, like, I feel like the requirement of physical proximity for most people to consider fighting game tournaments to be legit will sort of put a ceiling on how big fighting games can be as esports compared to almost any other kind of game.

169
00:13:30,781 --> 00:13:42,360
Scott: I think it actually, in a way, helps fighting games in that you aren't going to be, like, much like in the real world, right, sports-wise, right?

170
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,855
Scott: You think about fighting sports, right?

171
00:13:44,935 --> 00:13:45,480
Scott: Boxing, right?

172
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,480
Scott: You know, you don't have boxing every day like you have baseball, right?

173
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:55,379
Scott: Boxing is, like, you know, at least disregarding its brutality and the fact that we should not have it anymore.

174
00:13:58,501 --> 00:14:00,004
Scott: You know, boxing is like a big event.

175
00:14:00,024 --> 00:14:01,547
Scott: that's rare, right?

176
00:14:01,827 --> 00:14:04,011
Scott: It's like there's going to be a big fight, right?

177
00:14:04,332 --> 00:14:06,195
Scott: Pay-per-view, big deal, right?

178
00:14:06,215 --> 00:14:08,860
Scott: They're coming together, people are actually going to hurt each other, oh my god.

179
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:17,940
Scott: And even people who are fans of other sports, it's like, alright, it's time for the boxing, here it comes, once a few times a year, maybe, if you're lucky, right?

180
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:26,875
Scott: So, fighting games are not going to be the ones that the sport that's, like, there every day, like baseball, right?

181
00:14:26,915 --> 00:14:29,260
Scott: The way that, like, your Overwatch might be, right?

182
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:36,256
Scott: The fighting game is going to be the EVO once a year, here we go, fighting game time, let's go, right?

183
00:14:36,316 --> 00:14:37,940
Scott: And then you forget about it until it comes back.

184
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,160
Scott: Yep,

185
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:55,580
Rym: but at the same time, there's definitely a ceiling on the interest in things like boxing and MMA, like, there's a fervent community and most people don't care that much, or only care when they hear buzz, like it breaks into their mainstream media bubble and they hear buzz, like that Ronda Rousey fight, everyone's like, ooh, there's going to be this fight.

186
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:59,349
Scott: Yeah, sure, that's fine, but, you know, if you box, you can still make a ton of money, right?

187
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,093
Scott: So people will still do it.

188
00:15:01,574 --> 00:15:03,860
Scott: People still do, I mean, yeah, but people still do the same.

189
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,780
Rym: It seems like it's on a long decline.

190
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,071
Scott: Oh, yeah, definitely, especially right now.

191
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:10,820
Scott: It's not being helped.

192
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:14,540
Rym: Yeah, you can't really distance that unless you're Charlie Chaplin.

193
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:22,140
Scott: Yeah, you can, it's called the marathon, that's distance boxing, run away.

194
00:15:22,901 --> 00:15:24,324
Rym: That's my go-to fighting strategy.

195
00:15:24,826 --> 00:15:30,420
Rym: So, a game that you may never have heard of called Crucible is launching tomorrow.

196
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:45,780
Scott: Right, so, people might not know the whole story here, so Amazon had been trying to get in the games business for quite a while, and there was a game they were working on called Breakaway, and I was following that game because the concept of the game seemed really cool.

197
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:58,360
Scott: What it was was a game designed to be an esport, which was some sort of combination of, like, it was actually a ball and, like, some MOBA-ish actiony gaming going on, right?

198
00:15:59,161 --> 00:16:02,739
Scott: So, you'd be fighting the other people, but really, you'd be trying to get the ball to the other end.

199
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:09,450
Scott: And, you know, it seemed like the concept was good, but the game never launched.

200
00:16:09,491 --> 00:16:12,799
Scott: It was, like, an alpha or something that I didn't get into, and then that was sort of it.

201
00:16:13,481 --> 00:16:16,720
Scott: Or maybe I did play, like, once in the alpha, and then whatever, anyway.

202
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:22,160
Rym: Yeah, I kind of just ignored it, and every now and then you'd mention, like, that it existed, and I'd just promptly forget.

203
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:25,929
Scott: It was unique and an interesting concept, but it didn't happen.

204
00:16:25,949 --> 00:16:30,440
Scott: I actually met someone at MAGFest who really wanted to tell me what kind of a fiasco it was.

205
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:31,005
Rym: Oh, yeah!

206
00:16:31,045 --> 00:16:31,955
Rym: We gotta talk to that guy!

207
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:38,000
Scott: They were close to it, or they worked on it or something, but yeah, so that was a thing.

208
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,104
Scott: Amazon now is trying again.

209
00:16:40,164 --> 00:16:43,252
Scott: They are publishing this game called Crucible.

210
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,716
Scott: The developer is someone else.

211
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,060
Scott: The game's just on Steam.

212
00:16:46,561 --> 00:16:51,590
Scott: It'll be free to play starting tomorrow at May 20th, 2020.

213
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,574
Scott: So, for most of you, that's now.

214
00:16:53,654 --> 00:16:57,100
Scott: I imagine, you know, the live watchers, not so much, right?

215
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:04,151
Scott: But this game is actually another idea that I did have conceptually.

216
00:17:04,171 --> 00:17:06,655
Scott: And since it's free to play, I'll give it a shot.

217
00:17:06,675 --> 00:17:08,679
Scott: Worst case, I delete it immediately, right?

218
00:17:08,719 --> 00:17:09,119
Scott: No big deal.

219
00:17:09,961 --> 00:17:23,599
Scott: And it has a few different play modes, but the play mode that's most interesting is the obvious idea, I don't know why, I think only one company tried it before and didn't succeed with it, which is to take a MOBA, but instead of having an RTS, it'd be an FPS, right?

220
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,807
Scott: So, you have a map, you go around, right?

221
00:17:26,827 --> 00:17:28,211
Scott: There's NPCs coming at you.

222
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:30,576
Scott: You got NPCs going at the other team, right?

223
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:32,060
Scott: You shoot the NPCs and level up.

224
00:17:32,641 --> 00:17:33,562
Scott: You capture points.

225
00:17:34,063 --> 00:17:40,533
Scott: When you capture the points on the map for your team, they generate XP for your team, like a fountain, right?

226
00:17:40,813 --> 00:17:45,300
Scott: You have a few abilities that, you know, regen on cooldowns, just like a MOBA, right?

227
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:53,700
Scott: You get higher XP, you unlock, you upgrade your characters, your team gets stronger, and eventually you take the whole map and destroy the other team's base or whatever it is, right?

228
00:17:55,544 --> 00:18:03,259
Rym: I'm leery for the sole reason of, I've never found multiplayer team versus games where there's like local XP within a match to be worth it.

229
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,517
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know, it just-

230
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:16,620
Rym: 'Cause it tends to be a snowball of, like, the game will usually just come down to an optimization of that XP advancement compared to the rate the other team is doing it, and that tends-

231
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:23,556
Scott: That is true, but, you know, you have the also, right, the situations where it's like you're fighting the other team directly, right?

232
00:18:23,576 --> 00:18:25,440
Scott: You can do that immediately, right?

233
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:33,100
Scott: So, you know, it depends on how they do it, but the fact that it's an FPS and a MOBA I think is still- Well, it's a third person shooter.

234
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:40,242
Scott: Right, but that is still vastly more appealing than RTS controls of a little dude, like it's fucking- That is true.

235
00:18:41,105 --> 00:18:45,140
Rym: I feel like if we're gonna like something that's like Dota adjacent, it would be something like this.

236
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:53,548
Scott: Right, I still think that these, you know, the MOBA concept, right, at its core is juicy fun.

237
00:18:54,008 --> 00:19:01,296
Scott: It's just that every single implementation of it so far gets, like, these details wrong, at least in my opinion, right?

238
00:19:01,336 --> 00:19:11,380
Rym: Not for- they're making tons of money, so not wrong and everything, but, you know- Like, they tend to focus on, like, the leveling up aspects, they tend to focus on, like, these background things.

239
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:20,118
Rym: I hate these- I hate the concept of fighting, like, random goons that are weak on one of the lanes, like in the forest, just to level up.

240
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:26,980
Scott: Like, it seems like- Well, you're probably gonna be doing that in this game, but actually that's only one of the modes, so it has some other modes that could be interesting.

241
00:19:27,521 --> 00:19:32,560
Scott: I think there was a Battle Royale-ish mode that involved two player teams and, you know, shrinking circles.

242
00:19:33,061 --> 00:19:47,460
Scott: So it seems like they're doing a little bit of a shotgun approach with this game, where they got their 10 characters or however many, and they're trying to not do what the other FP- they're not trying to be Counter Strike, like the Valorant is, they're not trying to do what Overwatch is doing, right?

243
00:19:47,781 --> 00:19:49,072
Scott: They got different game modes.

244
00:19:49,113 --> 00:19:49,839
Scott: they're gonna try.

245
00:19:50,200 --> 00:20:06,400
Rym: And that's the part, actually, I'm excited about, because you can still trace all the popular multiplayer FPSs, trace from, like, five lineages, and all the popular esport games in this space between MOBAs, FPSs, everything, they still trace from, like, less than 10 lineages.

246
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:16,500
Scott: Right, so they're gonna- they're trying new game modes that we haven't seen before, necessarily, at least this- not, you know, I guess they're not 100% unique, but you get the idea.

247
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:19,300
Scott: So, free to play, I'll give this a shot tomorrow.

248
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:22,117
Rym: Yeah, I'll give it a shot, it doesn't look like it has any malware in it.

249
00:20:23,524 --> 00:20:24,079
Scott: Eh, not yet.

250
00:20:25,244 --> 00:20:25,405
Rym: Yep.

251
00:20:25,667 --> 00:20:28,880
Scott: So, speaking of- So you talked about EVO being cancelled.

252
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:34,920
Rym: Yep, oh yes, I guess we should talk about how Gen Con- Well, it's not cancelled, but yeah, right, so EVO is not cancelled, it's going online.

253
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:39,120
Rym: Gen Con can't go online, 'cause you're not- what are you gonna do, put everyone in TTS and Discord?

254
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:41,940
Scott: I think they're gonna try, but they're not gonna succeed.

255
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,280
Scott: Yeah,

256
00:20:42,521 --> 00:21:02,840
Rym: I think there's a sidebar there, or that, well, maybe we'll do another show on, 'cause I feel like we're gonna be in this boat for a while, but, uh, if you haven't noticed, a lot of conventions are trying to do online formats, and honestly, they're all kind of boring, or bad, or, like, not really worth engaging with, or, more importantly, not actually different from how cons already are.

257
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:08,056
Rym: Like, if you, like, most cons, when they try to go online, they're just like, "Okay, we'll have a panel track,

258
00:21:08,417 --> 00:21:08,799
Rym: online.".

259
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:16,820
Rym: Like, yeah, PAX already streams a bunch of the panel rooms, MagFest puts all the panels up on YouTube, like, it's not like they're taking questions from the stream.

260
00:21:17,341 --> 00:21:28,260
Rym: And in fact, they end up being worse, because as bad as the video recording is at most cons, the only thing worse than that is the average convention panelist attempting to record themselves at home.

261
00:21:29,901 --> 00:21:35,220
Scott: Yeah, well, I mean, they're usually all streaming themselves to a central location, which is then putting together a multi-person stream.

262
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:50,040
Rym: Yep, which then runs into weird lag issues, they tend to have all the same, like, it's basically all the awkwardness of the kind of poorly run, poorly moderated panels that typify a lot of conventions, coupled with the extra awkwardness of talking lag and online streaming difficulties.

263
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:56,620
Scott: Well, I see what a lot, one technique a lot of people actually use is to run a Zoom call, right, or use whatever kind of app like that.

264
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,800
Rym: Just record that, basically.

265
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:07,280
Scott: Right, the person doing the streaming opens up OBS, and basically is capturing different parts of the screen and inserting those into the OBS in different sections.

266
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:13,420
Scott: So it's like, yeah, it's actually Zoom, and they're just inserting each of the squares into their streaming layout, right?

267
00:22:14,021 --> 00:22:18,380
Scott: So you don't realize it's Zoom, or whatever other app they're using, Google Meet or whatever.

268
00:22:20,528 --> 00:22:21,199
Scott: So that's how they do.

269
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:30,320
Rym: But yeah, it's interesting that basically no one's been able to come up with a format that works, because there already is an online convention format, and people just don't engage with it that much.

270
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,242
Scott: No.

271
00:22:32,302 --> 00:22:37,373
Scott: But yeah, so that convention is not happening.

272
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:40,480
Scott: The Essen spiel is not happening.

273
00:22:41,521 --> 00:22:43,689
Scott: They're trying to try to do something digital as well.

274
00:22:43,809 --> 00:22:46,600
Scott: Every convention that's cancelled is trying to do something digital, right?

275
00:22:47,262 --> 00:22:54,300
Rym: The Animicons are the worst hit, because almost any content any panelist would have in an Animicon is going to get copyrighted immediately.

276
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:55,581
Scott: Right.

277
00:22:55,761 --> 00:23:00,593
Scott: Annacy, the French animation film festival, is going online.

278
00:23:00,613 --> 00:23:03,460
Scott: This is not Tuesday News, but whatever.

279
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,505
Scott: They're charging, I think, the equivalent of, what, $15?

280
00:23:06,505 --> 00:23:15,160
Scott: So you buy a digital ticket, and then you can watch the film festival films online on their site between times and dates.

281
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:19,330
Scott: And this is only interesting news for nerds, because it includes that C.G.

282
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:20,593
Scott: Lupin movie.

283
00:23:20,653 --> 00:23:23,740
Scott: We don't know yet if it includes English subtitles.

284
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:31,320
Scott: But we do know someone made a little Twitter thread telling you how to navigate and get signed up, because it's all in French.

285
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:40,280
Scott: But yeah, whatever convention it is that you're interested in, it's pretty much just, if it hasn't been cancelled or we didn't mention it's cancelled, pretend it is.

286
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:47,959
Rym: I mean, considering that Gen Con is in the beginning of August, pretty sure that there's no PAX West at this point, because PAX West is not that long after that.

287
00:23:49,460 --> 00:24:04,057
Rym: Also, PAX West still, by now, on a normal year, we'd have already submitted our panels, we'd already have a hotel somewhere, we'd probably already have our flights booked, and since none of that's happened yet, they're not even taking panel submissions, odds are pretty low.

288
00:24:04,077 --> 00:24:06,860
Rym: there's going to be a PAX West, or really any PAX's this year, I think.

289
00:24:09,144 --> 00:24:11,260
Rym: I still think PAX Australia has the best chance of happening.

290
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:12,623
Scott: Maybe.

291
00:24:12,745 --> 00:24:13,253
Scott: We got any news?

292
00:24:14,363 --> 00:24:16,300
Rym: Yeah, so another news, speaking of malware.

293
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,680
Scott: How many news is we gonna do here?

294
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,644
Rym: Doom Eternal, the last news, I guess.

295
00:24:19,945 --> 00:24:26,320
Rym: So Doom Eternal, I played a little bit of it, looked pretty fun, Scott beat it, just gonna review it, and an update came down.

296
00:24:27,001 --> 00:24:28,100
Rym: Did we review it already or no?

297
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,019
Rym: No, because I didn't finish it.

298
00:24:29,921 --> 00:24:30,450
Scott: Oh, okay.

299
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,019
Scott: How far did you get?

300
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,184
Rym: A few hours in.

301
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:35,039
Rym: I ended up getting a refund from Steam, so I can't finish it now.

302
00:24:35,421 --> 00:24:39,431
Rym: Because, so Doom Eternal came out, it was a pretty good game.

303
00:24:39,471 --> 00:24:42,500
Rym: from what everyone has said, you seem to like it, everyone had good things to say about it.

304
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:51,080
Rym: And then, they added in an update, a Denuvo anti-cheat, the same kind of bullshit that makes Valorant an unplayable, dangerous game.

305
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,528
Scott: Right, so there used to be, it used to be.

306
00:24:54,548 --> 00:24:58,140
Scott: the problem was a lot of these games would include these DRM packages.

307
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,360
Rym: Ubisoft would do that, I remember.

308
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,159
Scott: I think Denuvo actually even made one of them, I don't remember.

309
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:04,720
Rym: Are you surprised?

310
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,303
Scott: That's right, the name sounds familiar.

311
00:25:07,323 --> 00:25:17,960
Scott: The point is, these DRM packages would be all sorts of, you know, in order to prevent you from pirating the game, they would take elevated privileges on your computer and do shady biz to make sure you weren't pirating the game.

312
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:24,920
Scott: Because otherwise, you know, you have administrator access over your own computer, you could obviously fool any program running with a lower privilege.

313
00:25:25,381 --> 00:25:35,300
Scott: So it's hard to make a DRM that's not running at an elevated privilege level, which also means there's any security vulnerabilities or shady biz, it might, I don't know, spy on your keyboard, right?

314
00:25:36,002 --> 00:25:38,520
Scott: Because it has such elevated privileges on your computer.

315
00:25:40,281 --> 00:25:52,020
Scott: So, anti-cheat software runs into the same problem, right, in order to make sure that you're not cheating, right, because I could run a cheat program at elevated privileges that could manipulate the game running at a regular privilege level.

316
00:25:52,381 --> 00:25:57,779
Scott: The game can't know or do anything about that because that's how computers work and that's not going to change ever and it shouldn't.

317
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,380
Scott: So the result, there's a loud noise outside.

318
00:26:03,107 --> 00:26:03,599
Rym: Uh oh, uh oh.

319
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:17,120
Scott: Yep, yep, anyway, the result is that, you know, you get a game like Doom Eternal that got some multiplayer, they don't want you cheating, and they include this anti-cheat package in there, and what do you know?

320
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,019
Scott: The anti-cheat package is basically malware, you can't trust it.

321
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:31,700
Rym: Yep, it runs at kernel level, we talked about this on a GeekNights episode a long time ago, we were talking about like ring zero and like what all that terminology means, but basically as mega god super admin access to your PC.

322
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:41,740
Scott: Yep, so yeah, I uninstalled, after I beat, I didn't even have to like find out this news and then uninstall, I basically uninstalled Doom Eternal after I beat it.

323
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:57,980
Scott: So, but yeah, Doom Eternal never got that update, but you know, usually what happens historically is that all of the programs out there that have the DRM, they eventually remove it from their game.

324
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,720
Rym: Yep, they might not necessarily remove it from your PC though.

325
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:04,223
Scott: Well no no no, they remove it from their game and there's an update.

326
00:27:04,243 --> 00:27:18,800
Scott: because once the game is old enough and it's being sold at a low price, right, they're not making that much money off the game anymore, and I believe, not 100% sure, that the game developer/publisher still has to pay the DRM company for the license ongoing, right?

327
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:26,520
Scott: So there comes a point at which it's not worth it for them to pay for the DRM and their game anymore and that's why it gets removed from a lot of games somewhere down the line.

328
00:27:27,861 --> 00:27:33,980
Scott: And then you'd save to install the game again because DRM's gone, or buy it at the stupor's Steam sale for five bucks.

329
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:44,919
Scott: Anti-cheat however, right, is gonna be interesting because, well, cheating doesn't go away, right, but there is a license fee, presuming that it's the same model, right?

330
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:55,080
Scott: So, is it gonna be like when Doom Eternal multiplayer is no longer popular and no one cares about it, they'll stop paying and then put out a release that doesn't have this in it?

331
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,200
Rym: I mean, we don't actually know if they're paying or not.

332
00:27:58,383 --> 00:27:59,340
Scott: I'm just guessing, right?

333
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:10,020
Rym: Because it wouldn't be super shocking if this kernel-level stuff, they'd happily let you run it without any license fees because there's maybe other ways to monetize it in the future.

334
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:23,260
Scott: The point is, if you are playing Doom Eternal on PC, which is where you should play it if you're gonna play it, and it is a good game, you should take care to sandbox it, run it on a PC that you don't care about, uninstall the shit right away, et cetera, be aware.

335
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,237
Scott: I don't think there's a good way to sandbox it.

336
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,080
Scott: Try to play it with an old update.

337
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:36,160
Rym: Yeah, I think the only way to be safe was if you bought it and played it and are still playing it but did not let it update and never let it update again.

338
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:47,200
Scott: Yeah, see if you can prevent Steam from updating it and then play the game anyway, because as long as you don't want to do the online multiplayer, right, which I don't see any reason why you'd want to.

339
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,263
Rym: It looked like an okay mode.

340
00:28:48,584 --> 00:28:53,180
Rym: Well, the funniest thing was multiple people said they didn't even know it had multiplayer, which was kind of funny.

341
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:57,748
Scott: I knew it had it because the other one had it, but it's like, who cares about it?

342
00:28:57,768 --> 00:29:00,133
Scott: It's a single-player game first and foremost, right?

343
00:29:00,173 --> 00:29:01,817
Scott: It's like, who gives a shit about the multiplayer?

344
00:29:01,857 --> 00:29:03,240
Scott: Why did they even bother to include it?

345
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:07,720
Rym: Well, I mean, I feel like Doom is ripe for good multiplayer in general.

346
00:29:08,321 --> 00:29:22,260
Scott: It is, but I feel like the reason, the only guess I can have, right, is that when you play the single-player, you unlock stuff like skins and things like that, but skins have no meaning in a single-player game where you can't see yourself, really, right?

347
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:27,146
Scott: So I feel like the multiplayer almost was serving the single-player.

348
00:29:27,226 --> 00:29:36,820
Scott: It's like, yeah, here's the incentive to find secrets in the single-player that give you useless stuff like skins and badges or whatever, is to play this multiplayer we made.

349
00:29:38,102 --> 00:29:42,240
Scott: To make you want the things, otherwise it's like, alright, I got skins, what are we doing for?

350
00:29:43,421 --> 00:29:47,312
Rym: But the sad thing is, if you let it update, you wouldn't even know that this was added.

351
00:29:47,332 --> 00:29:48,676
Rym: There's no notification or anything.

352
00:29:48,716 --> 00:29:50,060
Rym: It just auto-deploys.

353
00:29:51,100 --> 00:30:01,800
Scott: Yep, I mean, you should definitely keep in mind, all games once you install from Steam or anywhere else, any kind of Epic stores or whatever, you need to be aware of what other things those games are installing.

354
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:05,848
Scott: Sometimes it's just Visual C++ redistributable, which is fine.

355
00:30:05,868 --> 00:30:07,371
Rym: Sometimes it's DirectX.

356
00:30:08,213 --> 00:30:10,798
Scott: Yeah, DirectX, that's fine, right?

357
00:30:10,818 --> 00:30:12,000
Scott: .net something, that's fine.

358
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:16,249
Scott: But sometimes it's de nouveau anti-cheat, and that's not fine.

359
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:18,896
Scott: I'm not saying you want to cheat either, right?

360
00:30:19,197 --> 00:30:20,420
Scott: Cheating is also a problem.

361
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:23,231
Rym: Oh yeah, cheating has ruined a lot of games permanently.

362
00:30:23,472 --> 00:30:25,540
Rym: Cheating just destroys an online game.

363
00:30:26,201 --> 00:30:30,370
Scott: But how do you, there's this battle here, it's like, to stop cheating, right?

364
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:34,820
Scott: This anti-cheat, despite all its evil, does seem to be somewhat effective, right?

365
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,100
Rym: Well, you'd say that, but at the same time, other games don't have kernel-level cheat detection like Overwatch.

366
00:30:40,401 --> 00:30:41,360
Scott: Those games have more cheating.

367
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,264
Rym: Overwatch does not have a cheating problem.

368
00:30:43,525 --> 00:30:47,934
Rym: Like, no one, there are not good, verified reports of cheating, really.

369
00:30:47,954 --> 00:30:50,520
Rym: People get caught and banned pretty quick.

370
00:30:53,881 --> 00:31:02,120
Scott: Yeah, well, I also don't think that, you know, the Doom company or whatever is putting as much effort into community management and their multiplayer.

371
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:05,380
Scott: Because it's not a big multiplayer thing, it's just like a side story.

372
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,565
Rym: Yeah, they don't have like a squad.

373
00:31:06,605 --> 00:31:10,160
Rym: that's like looking through reported data to figure out if someone's cheating.

374
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,680
Scott: There isn't a Doom multiplayer league with big followers and a whole thing going on.

375
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,386
Rym: But it is like, I just like, many of you might be too young to remember.

376
00:31:18,486 --> 00:31:24,460
Rym: I remember as a kid, like, play a game of Quake 2, go to a random server, like half the people there are running aimbots.

377
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:25,609
Scott: Yep.

378
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:28,849
Rym: Like, just straight up, every Counter-Strike game was full of hackers.

379
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:34,360
Rym: Like, I remember once I was playing Counter-Strike and the match- It's definitely less bad than in those days.

380
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:44,360
Rym: Yep, the match started and a dude instantly appeared in our spawn, knifed us all to death at hyper speed, and then proceeded to start screaming in the voice chat until everyone disconnected.

381
00:31:45,822 --> 00:31:47,186
Rym: Like, I just remember that moment.

382
00:31:47,688 --> 00:31:51,078
Rym: You just have to know, like, the IP addresses of the good servers where no one cheats.

383
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:58,020
Rym: So yeah, the problem is, long term, like, you know, to do the GeekNights thing, let's go to the far future.

384
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:04,380
Rym: There is a certain kind of cheating that literally could not ever be stopped by any software solution.

385
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:04,860
Scott: Like Robot Arm?

386
00:32:05,161 --> 00:32:05,723
Rym: Robot Arm.

387
00:32:06,023 --> 00:32:11,580
Rym: You could have a computer that controls a robot arm on a mouse with a USB that pretends to be a keyboard.

388
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:19,240
Rym: Or even just, it's two USBs, one pretends to be a keyboard, one pretends to be a mouse, and has a camera pointed at the screen.

389
00:32:19,641 --> 00:32:24,615
Rym: Or it just takes in an HDMI input and reads that visual field, and that's enough.

390
00:32:24,655 --> 00:32:26,460
Rym: You could make an aimbot with that and that alone.

391
00:32:27,861 --> 00:32:29,551
Scott: Yeah, I mean, this is a real thing.

392
00:32:29,591 --> 00:32:31,240
Scott: I've definitely seen demos of it in the past.

393
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:40,020
Scott: They literally, they had a camera looking at the screen, and a robot arm on a mouse, and, you know, hitting the buttons on the keyboard, and it was playing quick, right?

394
00:32:40,361 --> 00:32:43,080
Scott: So it's like, no software on the computer could detect that.

395
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:51,460
Scott: All that's happening is inputs on a mouse and keyboard that are, for the computer's perspective, are no different than inputs from a human being with their hands on a mouse and keyboard.

396
00:32:52,042 --> 00:32:58,820
Scott: It's just, there's another computer that is looking at a screen and perfectly aiming a mouse and getting headshots.

397
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:02,915
Scott: So it's like, no anti-cheat software can stop that.

398
00:33:02,955 --> 00:33:03,959
Scott: We need a different way.

399
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:08,339
Rym: I actually just now came up with a way that would kind of work.

400
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:14,980
Scott: The point is, the true path to stopping all cheating in online games must stop that kind of cheating.

401
00:33:15,361 --> 00:33:15,542
Rym: Yep.

402
00:33:15,802 --> 00:33:20,175
Rym: Of course, then you get to the point of, what if it's just a human cyborg playing the game?

403
00:33:21,239 --> 00:33:21,740
Rym: Is that cheating?

404
00:33:22,961 --> 00:33:24,860
Scott: No, that's just, you have to play in a different league.

405
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:25,863
Rym: Ah, but how do you know?

406
00:33:26,525 --> 00:33:31,039
Rym: How do you make some rando use a credit card to buy Doom as a cyborg or a regular human?

407
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:35,516
Scott: It's the same reason you have weight classes in boxing again, right?

408
00:33:35,857 --> 00:33:36,520
Scott: It's the same deal.

409
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,814
Scott: If I got cyborg arm, I gotta play in the cyborg baseball league.

410
00:33:39,834 --> 00:33:41,240
Scott: I can't play in the human baseball league.

411
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:41,420
Scott: Yep.

412
00:33:41,621 --> 00:33:51,640
Rym: The one interesting thing is, the games that have a well-structured tournament scene, there's almost this like, cheating can't really do anything for you because if you get ranked too high, people pay attention to you and figure out you're cheating.

413
00:33:53,361 --> 00:33:56,360
Rym: And it's like, now that you can show up to a tournament, you get invited to a tournament, you're fucked.

414
00:33:58,615 --> 00:33:58,989
Scott: That's true.

415
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:05,610
Rym: But I did come up with a way, and then we can move on to the rest of the show, a way to solve the robot arm problem.

416
00:34:06,191 --> 00:34:13,130
Rym: You require people who play, kind of like how certain team games, like, you almost need to require people to at least use the voice chat or at least listen in there.

417
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:14,888
Scott: There's too many problems with that.

418
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:22,830
Rym: Yeah, you could require that players have a webcam pointed at their hands to be able to play the game.

419
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:24,507
Scott: What if someone doesn't have hands?

420
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:29,250
Rym: Ah, then you have an, it has to be pointed at whatever adaptive device they're using to play the game.

421
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:34,610
Scott: What if they're using some like, mouth control thing because they're like, disabled?

422
00:34:34,771 --> 00:34:36,629
Rym: Then you gotta have a webcam pointed at that.

423
00:34:37,893 --> 00:34:39,610
Scott: What if they don't want to show you their face?

424
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:42,469
Rym: Well, then they can't play in the guaranteed no cheating league.

425
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:46,290
Scott: What if that's not very accessible now, is it?

426
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:48,384
Scott: It's an ableist league.

427
00:34:48,404 --> 00:34:48,829
Scott: you got there.

428
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:49,772
Rym: Well, but is it?

429
00:34:50,013 --> 00:34:54,830
Rym: you're requiring someone to prove that they're playing the game as opposed to a robot playing the game for them?

430
00:34:56,071 --> 00:34:56,252
Scott: Uh huh.

431
00:34:56,574 --> 00:34:58,730
Scott: Also, that video could also be fake too.

432
00:34:58,850 --> 00:34:59,833
Rym: That would be hard to say.

433
00:34:59,913 --> 00:35:06,690
Rym: That's the kind of thing that's difficult to fake because post hoc analysis could show if the keystrokes don't line up.

434
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:13,310
Rym: I mean, piano players freak out if they see like one wrong note watching a movie where someone happens to touch a piano for a second.

435
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:20,470
Scott: I could say that I'm using my, you know, my tongue controller because I'm a paraplegic when I'm not.

436
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:25,210
Scott: And someone off to the side has their hands on their mouse and keyboard because your league's not ableist, you're not going to kick me out.

437
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:30,750
Scott: Yeah, but then in a post hoc review, if somebody keeps you cheating- You're going to kick me out of your league because I don't have a webcam?

438
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:31,313
Rym: You know what?

439
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:33,267
Rym: You provide a webcam to anyone who can't afford one.

440
00:35:34,994 --> 00:35:35,802
Scott: Buy this video game.

441
00:35:35,843 --> 00:35:36,388
Scott: Get a free webcam.

442
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:39,930
Rym: Yeah, when you buy the video game, it comes with the webcam that prevents cheating.

443
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:47,430
Rym: The webcam also has a spike in it and the spike is deployed to finish and prevent future cheating once you are detected cheating.

444
00:35:47,931 --> 00:35:49,549
Scott: Way too many problems with your plan here.

445
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:54,290
Rym: It's better than your plan of 100% server side, which also isn't really feasible for a lot of reasons.

446
00:35:54,551 --> 00:35:55,430
Scott: I definitely think it is.

447
00:35:55,450 --> 00:36:01,050
Scott: That doesn't stop robot arm, nor does it stop cyborg, nor does it- Oh no, it doesn't stop robot- no, it doesn't stop those.

448
00:36:02,895 --> 00:36:03,188
Scott: Not at all.

449
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:07,530
Rym: I remember even at RIT we wouldn't let- we had a tournament at an anime club night.

450
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:15,490
Rym: We wouldn't let that one Rando use his control- he brought his own controller and he got really butter when we wouldn't let him use it because he might have programmed macros into it.

451
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:24,668
Rym: But anyway, it's time for Things of the Day.

452
00:36:24,728 --> 00:36:25,230
Rym: So what do you got?

453
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:42,689
Scott: So, uh, most people- I don't know how to guess not most people, but a lot of people, when they get a pen in their hand and they're doodlin', there is some sort of, like, innate thing that are- I don't think it's, um, you know, biological.

454
00:36:42,729 --> 00:36:43,670
Scott: I definitely think it's societal.

455
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:44,509
Rym: It's definitely cultural.

456
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:46,232
Scott: Right, cultural.

457
00:36:46,753 --> 00:36:52,910
Scott: It's just this, like, subconscious, like, thing that will move your hand and draw a penis.

458
00:36:54,572 --> 00:36:56,353
Scott: And I've seen this infect a lot of people.

459
00:36:56,994 --> 00:37:13,610
Scott: And the thing is, it might not actually happen, but as soon as you, like, suggest to someone, draw a penis or don't draw a penis or phallus or- you mention anything phallic in any way while someone's drawing.

460
00:37:14,411 --> 00:37:17,820
Scott: And, you know, you play, like, TKO or whatever, it's like penises come out.

461
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,303
Scott: You play draw a phallus, penises come out.

462
00:37:19,323 --> 00:37:20,968
Scott: It just happens with any group you play with.

463
00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:21,890
Scott: It's just a thing.

464
00:37:24,252 --> 00:37:24,412
Scott: Right?

465
00:37:24,432 --> 00:37:30,384
Scott: Uh, so someone made this website and it has machine learning that looks at what you're drawing.

466
00:37:30,424 --> 00:37:33,009
Scott: It's just a big surface in your web browser that you can draw on.

467
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:40,690
Scott: And it used machine learning to look at what you're drawing and it comments on what you're drawing and it's quite shockingly good at recognizing what you're drawing.

468
00:37:41,271 --> 00:37:43,296
Scott: As long as you don't draw anything too complicated.

469
00:37:43,697 --> 00:37:46,043
Scott: Like, I drew a fire and it said, "Is that a

470
00:37:46,083 --> 00:37:46,625
Scott: fireplace?"

471
00:37:46,685 --> 00:37:48,108
Scott: And I drew some logs and it's like, "Oh, a

472
00:37:48,129 --> 00:37:48,570
Scott: campfire.".

473
00:37:49,111 --> 00:37:49,912
Scott: I drew a palm tree.

474
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:50,753
Scott: It knew a palm tree.

475
00:37:50,773 --> 00:37:51,674
Scott: It knew a fish.

476
00:37:51,734 --> 00:37:53,477
Scott: It knew a basketball.

477
00:37:53,537 --> 00:37:54,899
Scott: It knew all kinds of stuff.

478
00:37:54,959 --> 00:37:56,721
Scott: I drew a car, person.

479
00:37:56,801 --> 00:38:02,970
Scott: It just knew what I was drawing and made funny comments on it in a portal, GLaDOS kind of way.

480
00:38:04,011 --> 00:38:08,901
Scott: But the website is, I believe, don'tdrawpenis.com.

481
00:38:09,863 --> 00:38:12,830
Scott: And you try to draw a penis on this website and see what happens.

482
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:15,597
Rym: So I was able to and I've replicated it a few times.

483
00:38:16,078 --> 00:38:20,150
Rym: It was pretty easy to draw a penis as long as I drew it attached to a stick figure.

484
00:38:22,352 --> 00:38:25,950
Scott: But yeah, it mostly detects if you're drawing a standalone penis.

485
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,233
Rym: I also enjoy playing it.

486
00:38:27,313 --> 00:38:29,258
Rym: The voice reminds me of the Zombicon voice.

487
00:38:29,318 --> 00:38:33,148
Rym: It's this calm voice that's just like, "Ah, you have drawn a

488
00:38:33,168 --> 00:38:33,389
Rym: tooth.".

489
00:38:35,591 --> 00:38:38,458
Rym: Some drawings may be artistic in nature.

490
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,610
Rym: It's a vaguely surreal, fun experience just to doodle around on this thing.

491
00:38:44,511 --> 00:38:46,416
Rym: So my thing of the day, pretty brief.

492
00:38:46,656 --> 00:38:48,080
Rym: You're probably all familiar with SimCity.

493
00:38:48,621 --> 00:38:52,370
Rym: But that technology was used, and there's a whole article here.

494
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:54,058
Rym: I'm not going to explain the whole article.

495
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:54,902
Rym: You can just read this.

496
00:38:55,203 --> 00:38:56,590
Rym: This person did all the research.

497
00:38:57,011 --> 00:39:07,910
Rym: But it talks about how SimCity was used as sort of the blueprint to make serious games to train people in real-world things other than just building fake, simplistic cities.

498
00:39:08,632 --> 00:39:14,388
Scott: Well, I imagine there were many jobs that basically amount to being a SimCity boss, mayor, right?

499
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:24,430
Rym: Well, the example is SimRefinery, of which very few screenshots remain, that was in this category of games that most people are not really familiar with, like serious games.

500
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:37,250
Rym: But these are games or entertainment software or interactive software of some kind that is used primarily to train people or to simulate things for various serious purposes.

501
00:39:38,211 --> 00:39:39,857
Rym: This tradition goes back a long time.

502
00:39:39,917 --> 00:39:41,222
Rym: War games were basically that.

503
00:39:41,765 --> 00:39:43,190
Rym: And things like that still exist today.

504
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:54,710
Rym: Like the military, spy organizations, manufacturers, all sorts of organizations around the world will either make, get other people to make, or otherwise use games for these purposes.

505
00:39:55,190 --> 00:40:06,010
Rym: And this is an article talking about the lineage of how SimCity ended up evolving into being one of these games when some of the people from the company split off to make serious games.

506
00:40:06,431 --> 00:40:07,973
Rym: And sort of just a long history of that.

507
00:40:10,978 --> 00:40:17,850
Rym: The craziest thing is, there are only like two images known on Earth of SimRefinery.

508
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:22,590
Rym: Like no one has the code, no one has an emulated version of it, like it's just gone as far as I can tell.

509
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:30,710
Rym: Granted, I didn't do any research, I'm purely basing it on this article, but this is just an interesting, fascinating space.

510
00:40:31,251 --> 00:40:37,730
Rym: And this is also a space where there are jobs and like you could work in this place, like this kind of thing.

511
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:49,510
Rym: You could literally, your job could be game designer for the government or game designer for a giant tech company for internal games that will never be released to the outside world to solve very specific problems.

512
00:40:50,051 --> 00:40:58,110
Scott: I don't know why you wouldn't release your game to the outside world, because if it's true that your game does train people to do the job, right?

513
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:06,790
Scott: Then you could, it's like if you need employees, which a lot of people do for specialized things, it's like you put that out there, someone might play it for fun.

514
00:41:07,411 --> 00:41:09,000
Scott: And then you'll be like, "Oh, who's the best at this

515
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:09,342
Scott: game?".

516
00:41:09,382 --> 00:41:10,106
Scott: And you'll be like, "Boom, you're

517
00:41:10,126 --> 00:41:10,408
Scott: hired."

518
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:10,690
Scott: Right?

519
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:17,250
Rym: Well, some of them include specifically secret or sensitive information.

520
00:41:18,532 --> 00:41:19,930
Scott: Maybe that shouldn't be in the training?

521
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:22,289
Rym: Well, I mean, what if you're trained in a spy?

522
00:41:25,116 --> 00:41:27,210
Scott: Use fake secret information.

523
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:29,697
Rym: But what if the secret information is like operational tactics?

524
00:41:29,717 --> 00:41:33,690
Rym: You're training someone in operational tactics that are not public for a reason.

525
00:41:33,811 --> 00:41:35,670
Scott: Oh, okay, the tactics themselves are not public.

526
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:41,070
Rym: Yeah, like the thing, the techniques they're teaching you are themselves things that normal people are not supposed to know.

527
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:46,190
Scott: You could put the game out there with some other tactics that are fine to share.

528
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:52,944
Rym: Or you get into the situation like SWAT, Police Quest SWAT, which kind of was just a, "Here's how to be a SWAT officer.

529
00:41:53,245 --> 00:41:54,968
Rym: This is how a SWAT team actually busts into your

530
00:41:54,989 --> 00:41:55,249
Rym: house.".

531
00:41:56,421 --> 00:41:56,548
Scott: Yep.

532
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,757
Rym: So this is just a cool article you should read.

533
00:41:59,259 --> 00:42:02,030
Rym: You might learn a lot of things you didn't know about serious gaming.

534
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:03,358
Rym: And how to run an oil refinery?

535
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:06,516
Rym: Yeah, if we can find that game.

536
00:42:06,576 --> 00:42:09,190
Rym: I want to see an AGDQ of Sim Refinery.

537
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:20,010
Rym: But the point that makes this the most interesting and is something that we kind of talk about a lot when we review games is the idea of your working or mental model of a system.

538
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:29,930
Rym: Like, when I play a board game, I develop a mental model or a series of heuristics around the game that help me understand it because I can't fully understand the state of the game.

539
00:42:30,571 --> 00:42:34,980
Rym: And these games don't try to be a totally realistic simulation.

540
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:53,210
Rym: Their primary goal, at least in the types of serious games this article talks about, the primary goal is specifically to help the players start to build their own mental model of a complex system, if not necessarily getting to the point of them having a model that's accurate to the real system.

541
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:57,810
Rym: It'll get them further along or more ready to start to model the real system.

542
00:42:59,291 --> 00:43:05,730
Rym: Like, you play SimCity, you start to build a mental model of how cities work, it's not that accurate, but it's not that inaccurate.

543
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:16,610
Rym: So yeah, I'm at a moment, we're stuck at home, doing vague livestreams as we can, trying to make content, gonna work on some stuff as we keep saying, join our forum.

544
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:19,098
Scott: Yeah, this weekend is like a big weekend for everyone.

545
00:43:19,901 --> 00:43:22,750
Scott: So not only, I guess I don't have to work Friday, I don't know about other people.

546
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:24,410
Rym: I mean, yeah, most people have to work Friday.

547
00:43:25,631 --> 00:43:29,738
Scott: In the United States, there's not gonna be work for a lot of people on Monday either.

548
00:43:29,758 --> 00:43:36,410
Scott: So even though you're working at home, now you can be at home and not have to even think about whatever your job is if you're working from home.

549
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:37,628
Scott: If you're lucky enough.

550
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:42,090
Rym: I'm gonna do some more tests with that teleprompter and set up some more of my streaming infrastructure.

551
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:47,359
Scott: Right, so that gives us time to keep working on content making because you don't gotta do anything else.

552
00:43:47,399 --> 00:43:52,670
Scott: All the time that I used to spend making a panel at a convention, it's like, well, maybe I'll just, you know, do something else.

553
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:57,620
Rym: Yeah, at some point I'm gonna start writing new panels and just videoing them, but that'll be in a little bit.

554
00:43:57,901 --> 00:44:02,570
Rym: That'll be a lot easier when Scott and I can visit each other and then we can at least do a normal GeekNights panel together.

555
00:44:03,451 --> 00:44:04,490
Scott: You could do a one-person panel.

556
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:05,917
Rym: Yeah, I got some one-person panels.

557
00:44:06,179 --> 00:44:07,929
Rym: I'm actually thinking about doing something that I...

558
00:44:08,171 --> 00:44:09,604
Scott: I'll do a one-person panel.

559
00:44:09,624 --> 00:44:10,330
Scott: We'll see who's better.

560
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:11,613
Rym: Oh, we could definitely do that.

561
00:44:12,936 --> 00:44:18,650
Rym: I mean, the only one I've ever done is I made that Five Nights at Freddy's one that I'm still pretty proud of and actually seems to still get a lot of views.

562
00:44:20,492 --> 00:44:22,529
Scott: Oh, it's probably people just searching for Five Nights at Freddy's.

563
00:44:22,873 --> 00:44:23,704
Rym: Yeah, but it was a video...

564
00:44:24,952 --> 00:44:25,948
Scott: What's really hot right now?

565
00:44:26,791 --> 00:44:27,501
Rym: Not train games.

566
00:44:27,542 --> 00:44:28,009
Rym: That's just us.

567
00:44:28,551 --> 00:44:29,904
Scott: Yeah, do the Valorant thing.

568
00:44:29,924 --> 00:44:30,530
Scott: Do a Valorant panel.

569
00:44:30,611 --> 00:44:31,690
Rym: I can't because I don't want to play it.

570
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:34,815
Scott: Well, you don't have to play it to do a panel.

571
00:44:35,156 --> 00:44:35,958
Rym: Make a YouTube video.

572
00:44:35,978 --> 00:44:38,564
Scott: If you just make a YouTube video, this is Valorant in the title.

573
00:44:38,644 --> 00:44:40,930
Scott: It'll show up in a Valorant search and then say some stuff.

574
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:41,860
Rym: Yeah, I'm not into that.

575
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:42,650
Rym: It has to be a good panel.

576
00:44:43,572 --> 00:44:44,008
Scott: I'm just saying.

577
00:44:44,471 --> 00:44:50,550
Rym: I feel like what I want to do is that thing that I keep talking about a lot in panels, but I've never done a panel about it specifically.

578
00:44:51,430 --> 00:45:10,430
Rym: I always talk about how Overwatch did a lot of what Team Fortress 2 did, but somehow Team Fortress 2 just collapsed and yet Overwatch succeeded in the game design of two very similar games and how these tiny, tiny differences between the two ended up having radical consequences for how they actually played.

579
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:15,082
Rym: That'd probably take a few weeks to get all the data together to put that up.

580
00:45:15,503 --> 00:45:15,824
Scott: We'll see.

581
00:45:16,306 --> 00:45:16,828
Rym: We'll see what we do.

582
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:18,652
Rym: Anything else?

583
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:21,730
Rym: We're not really reading through the tale of Hanzo at the moment.

584
00:45:22,391 --> 00:45:27,508
Scott: We are not reading the tale of Genji, which is our current book club book selection, though I might soon.

585
00:45:27,608 --> 00:45:28,250
Scott: Who knows?

586
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:29,790
Rym: Yeah, I mean, got a long weekend.

587
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:41,930
Scott: If it gets warmer, I'll bike, obviously, but if I'm not biking, I can't go to the beach, so I guess the beach sitting time will be replaced with more biking and sitting on the balcony reading, maybe?

588
00:45:43,152 --> 00:45:46,943
Rym: I might bike up on those trails and then just stop and read for a while before I bike home.

589
00:45:46,963 --> 00:45:49,189
Rym: I might just bike to the park and read a little bit.

590
00:45:49,209 --> 00:45:49,470
Rym: We'll see.

591
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,610
Scott: We can go read in the middle of Yorktown, huh?

592
00:45:53,852 --> 00:46:00,050
Rym: All right, so the games we've been reviewing lately are the games that we can easily play semi-asynchronously online.

593
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:07,290
Scott: Asynchronously games online are difficult because you need to get a lot of people together with technology and such and such.

594
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:09,493
Scott: Asynchronous games are on websites.

595
00:46:09,873 --> 00:46:11,636
Scott: You take your turn whenever you've got time.

596
00:46:11,876 --> 00:46:13,318
Scott: You can do it while you're at work, right?

597
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:24,549
Scott: Perfect game for stuck at home.

598
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:25,450
Rym: Yep.

599
00:46:25,731 --> 00:46:30,506
Rym: So we've been playing these train games and now we've moved on to a game that I've known about for a long time.

600
00:46:30,847 --> 00:46:31,710
Rym: Like I kind of knew the deal.

601
00:46:32,255 --> 00:46:33,330
Scott: I've heard the name of it before.

602
00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:36,255
Rym: I'd seen it, but I just hadn't played it.

603
00:46:36,996 --> 00:46:40,723
Rym: And because of all the things we said about 1889 and 1846 and 2038, those three reviews you can read or listen to.

604
00:46:45,191 --> 00:46:46,940
Rym: There are transcriptions on YouTube, it looks like.

605
00:46:47,201 --> 00:46:48,909
Rym: I didn't check how good they are, but I saw them there.

606
00:46:50,331 --> 00:46:52,194
Rym: But you can check those reviews out.

607
00:46:52,274 --> 00:47:01,870
Rym: But one of our complaints about the train games is around how we really like the stock stuff more so than the operating round is almost just like bookkeeping.

608
00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:11,030
Rym: So now we played rolling stock where the bookkeeping and the so-called operating round is abstracted away to almost nothing.

609
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:15,790
Rym: And this game is basically just about the companies and the stock shenanigans.

610
00:47:16,911 --> 00:47:17,072
Scott: Right.

611
00:47:17,092 --> 00:47:22,970
Scott: So in most of the 18X train games, you start the game with some sort of auction for private companies.

612
00:47:23,531 --> 00:47:28,387
Scott: And as the game goes on, those private companies are folded into public companies and they disappear.

613
00:47:28,508 --> 00:47:29,150
Scott: That's the end of them.

614
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:40,210
Scott: Their purpose is that in a non-random game, because these games have no randomness whatsoever, to sort of start the game in an asymmetric way.

615
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:52,810
Scott: Not just the turn order already provides some asymmetry, but the fact that you have to start by auctioning off these unique private companies and everyone gets however many they end up buying.

616
00:47:53,891 --> 00:48:01,950
Scott: It means that everyone starts in an asymmetric position, which sort of is then the spark that sets off the asymmetric non-random game.

617
00:48:02,632 --> 00:48:04,510
Rym: Like the grain of sand inside of a pearl.

618
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:06,091
Scott: Exactly.

619
00:48:06,572 --> 00:48:20,330
Scott: So in rolling stock, the way this game works is much like the 18XX games, it starts off with an auction for private companies, but that auction for private companies continues throughout the game.

620
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:33,790
Scott: There is a stack of private companies and they keep turning out new ones and each turn, one of the phases, the important phase where most of the game happens, is an auction for the currently available private companies between all of the players.

621
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:36,594
Scott: The players can use their money in this auction.

622
00:48:36,694 --> 00:48:38,197
Scott: The money in your personal wallet.

623
00:48:38,638 --> 00:48:45,270
Scott: The public corporations that absorb the private companies cannot bid in this auction.

624
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:57,910
Scott: So what happens is the flow of the game is people start with money, there's no public companies whatsoever, you participate in these auctions to acquire private companies.

625
00:48:57,990 --> 00:49:11,790
Scott: The private companies spit out money, but much like these private companies, while also serving the purpose of the private companies in other 18XX games, they also serve as abstractions of the trains.

626
00:49:12,671 --> 00:49:20,030
Rym: They have just an income and they have synergies with other companies, like every company will have synergies with some of the other companies.

627
00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:23,015
Scott: Well, hold on, you're getting ahead of yourself here, right?

628
00:49:23,396 --> 00:49:27,704
Scott: So the private companies spit out money and they rust, like the trains do.

629
00:49:27,865 --> 00:49:30,410
Scott: Over time, the amount of money they spit out goes down.

630
00:49:30,871 --> 00:49:31,985
Rym: And you have to get rid of them.

631
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:34,475
Rym: It'll give you income, like $3.

632
00:49:34,475 --> 00:49:36,800
Rym: every turn, you just get $3, awesome, that's cool.

633
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:41,190
Rym: But then, as the game goes on, their income drops and drops and eventually becomes negative.

634
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:43,212
Scott: Yeah, and then you want to dump them.

635
00:49:43,673 --> 00:49:45,876
Scott: Much like the trains in an 18XX game.

636
00:49:45,896 --> 00:49:54,790
Scott: You get a train, the train that you bought, that a company bought generates revenues that turn into dividends, and then the train rusts and it goes out of the game and you have to buy new trains.

637
00:49:55,850 --> 00:49:59,155
Scott: Also, in an 18XX game, you usually have tracks, right?

638
00:49:59,236 --> 00:50:08,390
Scott: And what the tracks do is, you know, based on your position on the board, sort of determines how much money different trains can get, right?

639
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:15,190
Scott: Two companies might have the same trains, but one with a better board position might be spitting out more money because it's better aligned on the map.

640
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:22,610
Scott: Rolling stock, the private companies, again, abstract away the map because they have the synergies that Rym mentioned.

641
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:30,210
Rym: Yup, so Company A, if you own both Company A and Company B together in a corporation, they get like a little bonus to how much income they generate.

642
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:35,337
Scott: Right, so Company A, if you just hold onto it privately to yourself, will spit out X dollars.

643
00:50:35,817 --> 00:50:38,101
Scott: Company B might also just spit out X dollars.

644
00:50:38,141 --> 00:50:43,588
Scott: You hold onto them yourself and you just get the income that they spit out until they rust and you get rid of them.

645
00:50:43,789 --> 00:50:44,630
Scott: No big deal, right?

646
00:50:46,011 --> 00:50:52,448
Scott: If that was the whole game, then the whole game would just be bid for the best private companies, the end, and hold on, right?

647
00:50:52,488 --> 00:50:53,410
Scott: There would be no public companies.

648
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:57,490
Rym: It would basically just be Pizarro or it would just be the auctions in Power Grid and nothing else.

649
00:50:58,510 --> 00:51:00,976
Scott: Right, so what you do is you form public companies.

650
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:03,421
Scott: You can form them just whenever arbitrarily.

651
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:04,423
Scott: I kind of like that.

652
00:51:04,483 --> 00:51:06,728
Scott: There's not like these specified ones like 18XX says.

653
00:51:07,771 --> 00:51:10,421
Scott: You're just like, "Oh, I'll start the bear company.

654
00:51:10,481 --> 00:51:11,424
Scott: I'll start the wheel

655
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:11,866
Scott: company."

656
00:51:11,906 --> 00:51:12,870
Scott: Whatever, right?

657
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:17,474
Scott: And when you start those companies, you have a stock price, right?

658
00:51:17,494 --> 00:51:18,215
Scott: Because now they're public.

659
00:51:18,255 --> 00:51:19,096
Scott: People can buy shares.

660
00:51:19,116 --> 00:51:19,977
Scott: You issue shares.

661
00:51:20,558 --> 00:51:21,699
Scott: Money goes into the company.

662
00:51:21,719 --> 00:51:22,640
Scott: It has its own wallet.

663
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:27,751
Scott: And the corporation, this public, can absorb the private corporations.

664
00:51:27,811 --> 00:51:31,940
Scott: And in fact, to form one, you must start by putting a private company into it.

665
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:39,368
Scott: And then that income that the private company was spitting out now goes into the public company's wallet.

666
00:51:39,929 --> 00:51:48,900
Scott: But if private companies that synergize with each other because they are abstractly in good positions together on the map that doesn't exist, right?

667
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:49,964
Scott: They go well together.

668
00:51:50,547 --> 00:51:53,700
Scott: They will spit out bonus dollars that add up to a lot of dollars.

669
00:51:53,980 --> 00:52:01,731
Rym: And the fiction is like these two railways interconnect with each other or like this airline would actually overlap with like these rail routes that complete.

670
00:52:01,931 --> 00:52:04,555
Rym: But honestly, the theme literally does not matter at all.

671
00:52:04,755 --> 00:52:08,420
Rym: These are just acronyms that synergize with other acronyms and they all have colors.

672
00:52:09,421 --> 00:52:09,601
Scott: Right.

673
00:52:09,621 --> 00:52:13,247
Scott: But if the right acronyms get into the same company together, more money comes out.

674
00:52:13,687 --> 00:52:21,760
Scott: So by starting the public company, you can get more value from those synergies than just holding on to money fountains for your personal gain.

675
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:26,948
Rym: Now, starting a company like starting a corporation is pretty cool because it's a real IPO.

676
00:52:27,008 --> 00:52:34,140
Rym: Like if you do it, you put the company that you own personally into this corporation, you pick one like bear or wheel.

677
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,023
Scott: It goes it goes public.

678
00:52:36,363 --> 00:52:48,600
Rym: And the other way the IPO works is basically you get a share and the bank gets a share and you pay your money to the company for that share and the bank pays its money to the company for that share.

679
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:52,486
Rym: So by IPO, you basically get other investors in.

680
00:52:52,546 --> 00:52:55,852
Rym: Now, the company has more cash than just what you put into it.

681
00:52:55,892 --> 00:52:58,276
Rym: The whole point of an IPO is to raise capital.

682
00:52:58,636 --> 00:52:58,957
Rym: It does.

683
00:52:59,017 --> 00:53:00,379
Rym: It's a pretty elegant mechanism.

684
00:53:00,419 --> 00:53:00,900
Rym: how it works.

685
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:07,328
Scott: And then what you can also do is, you know, you started this, you know, I took one of my companies that I won at auction.

686
00:53:07,589 --> 00:53:07,749
Scott: Right.

687
00:53:07,809 --> 00:53:09,191
Scott: I put it into the company.

688
00:53:09,812 --> 00:53:10,733
Scott: It went public.

689
00:53:11,194 --> 00:53:11,414
Scott: Right.

690
00:53:11,755 --> 00:53:15,240
Scott: And in exchange, because I gave up a private company, it's no longer under my control.

691
00:53:15,781 --> 00:53:17,265
Scott: I'm given a share in that company.

692
00:53:17,325 --> 00:53:23,020
Scott: So I didn't really lose anything because that share has the value is the is the exchange I get for the company.

693
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,545
Rym: You also pick the price.

694
00:53:24,606 --> 00:53:25,951
Rym: The company opens ad.

695
00:53:26,012 --> 00:53:27,860
Rym: What is the starting price of this stock?

696
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:28,421
Scott: Yeah.

697
00:53:28,781 --> 00:53:31,705
Scott: Well, if you're the president, yeah, you can issue more shares, all this stuff.

698
00:53:31,765 --> 00:53:42,640
Scott: But the point is, is that now that the public company has one private company in it, the way it gets more private, because in order to have the synergies, it has to have more than one private company in it.

699
00:53:43,421 --> 00:53:53,580
Scott: The way it gets more than one is that you can, if you're the president, right, you can decide which private companies that public company will buy with its money, just acquisition.

700
00:53:53,660 --> 00:54:05,458
Rym: You can buy them from other corporations, or you can buy them from players, which means if you're the president of a company, you can buy a corporation that you, the player, own directly and just agree to it.

701
00:54:05,498 --> 00:54:06,580
Rym: You just be corrupt as hell.

702
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:07,440
Scott: Right.

703
00:54:07,681 --> 00:54:09,283
Scott: That is basically the flow of the game.

704
00:54:09,323 --> 00:54:14,769
Scott: is you buy private companies in this auction, corporations, public ones cannot participate in the auction.

705
00:54:14,870 --> 00:54:23,300
Scott: Therefore, you take your money, you buy companies, you put some of them into, they go public together, create synergy to create more value.

706
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:26,183
Scott: You then get money out, right?

707
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:41,280
Scott: This is the important part because you have to make sure because the only way you can participate in the auctions for more companies is if you personally have money in your wallet, right, owning shares, you can't use that money in an auction unless you sell the share and you can't sell your last share in a corporation.

708
00:54:41,881 --> 00:54:52,236
Scott: You know, money that's in the company's wallet, right, because it got a, because the bank bought some shares, right, which gave the company money that you can't use that to buy companies at the auction.

709
00:54:52,276 --> 00:54:55,200
Scott: You need money in your personal wallet to participate in the auction.

710
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:02,190
Scott: And then you buy companies in the auction and now, well, now you'd have enough money to buy another company, right?

711
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:08,940
Scott: You sell the company you bought to the corporation to get the money out of the corporate wallet into your personal wallet for the next auction.

712
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:11,766
Rym: There's only four ways to get money into your personal wallet.

713
00:55:11,786 --> 00:55:14,170
Rym: Like there's not a lot of ways to get money back in this game.

714
00:55:14,211 --> 00:55:18,820
Rym: You either own a company that's just spitting out revenue, which is not going to help you in the long run.

715
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:21,864
Scott: It helps some, depends.

716
00:55:22,565 --> 00:55:29,097
Scott: If a company isn't really doing any synergy, then there's really, I don't see much reason to have it be in a public company.

717
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:30,600
Scott: You might as well just keep it on your own.

718
00:55:31,701 --> 00:55:37,580
Rym: I guess unless you use the IPO to have more money than you could have otherwise to acquire something somewhere else.

719
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:37,800
Rym: Yeah.

720
00:55:37,861 --> 00:55:45,920
Scott: If you, you might want to use a low synergy company as the IPO company, but yeah, otherwise you're going to get the better value just by holding it, right?

721
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:52,053
Rym: You can, uh, like Scott said, you can buy companies, your corporation can buy companies from you or other players.

722
00:55:52,234 --> 00:55:54,960
Rym: Corporations might buy a company from you if that's the one they want.

723
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:55,869
Scott: You can buy any which way.

724
00:55:55,889 --> 00:55:56,476
Scott: Always.

725
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:02,126
Rym: Number three, every round, one of the things you do is decide how many dividends to issue.

726
00:56:02,366 --> 00:56:14,600
Rym: So if you say the dividend is $4, the corporation pays $4 to each shareholder on record, which as you might recall, since the bank gets half the shares, unless other people have bought shares, you own a share and a bank owes the share.

727
00:56:14,981 --> 00:56:21,981
Rym: If you do a dividend of $4, you get $4, the bank gets $4, the company loses $8.

728
00:56:21,981 --> 00:56:22,102
Scott: Right.

729
00:56:22,142 --> 00:56:25,032
Scott: The other way is obviously it's a stock game.

730
00:56:25,052 --> 00:56:27,480
Scott: You could own shares that increase in value and then sell.

731
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:28,860
Rym: Now this is where the game is.

732
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:29,457
Scott: That is hard.

733
00:56:30,702 --> 00:56:39,020
Rym: 18XX games have a abstracted and like it's so abstracted that it's realistic, but only in an obtuse way stock market.

734
00:56:39,801 --> 00:56:41,866
Rym: Most games have just completely fake stock markets.

735
00:56:42,407 --> 00:56:47,880
Rym: The stock market, the way stock prices work in this game is shockingly realistic.

736
00:56:49,041 --> 00:56:50,066
Scott: It's pretty real.

737
00:56:50,207 --> 00:56:52,880
Scott: It's not a hundred percent real because it's still an abstract.

738
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:56,433
Rym: But it's real close to the real world because basically there's a lot of parts.

739
00:56:56,473 --> 00:56:58,320
Scott: There's a lot of parts of it that are very real.

740
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,473
Rym: I'll describe it vaguely because you can read the rules.

741
00:57:00,533 --> 00:57:01,439
Rym: Like we'll link to a PDF.

742
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:04,109
Scott: If someone buys, there's a, there's a line of prices.

743
00:57:04,370 --> 00:57:06,640
Scott: No two stocks can have the same price, right?

744
00:57:06,961 --> 00:57:15,140
Scott: If someone buys a share, you go up to the next available price, which might mean jumping over other companies if they have the prices that are right in front of you, right?

745
00:57:15,461 --> 00:57:19,028
Scott: When you sell a share, it moves down in price to the next available price.

746
00:57:20,050 --> 00:57:25,220
Scott: However, if when you buy a share, right, it moves up, but you pay where it moved to.

747
00:57:26,081 --> 00:57:29,654
Scott: And when you sell, you get the money of where it moved to.

748
00:57:29,955 --> 00:57:31,260
Scott: You don't get the money of where it moved from.

749
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:32,705
Rym: Just like the real stock market, the price.

750
00:57:32,745 --> 00:57:37,140
Rym: you see, if you look at what's the price of a stock, that's just the last price it traded at effectively.

751
00:57:37,541 --> 00:57:40,466
Rym: So say star corporation is sitting at $28.

752
00:57:40,466 --> 00:57:41,588
Rym: I want to buy a share.

753
00:57:41,608 --> 00:57:43,752
Rym: The next price up on the chart is 31.

754
00:57:43,752 --> 00:57:48,800
Rym: So it costs $31 to buy a share and then the price becomes 31.

755
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:49,805
Rym: Want to buy another share?

756
00:57:49,825 --> 00:57:55,062
Rym: I got to pay 34 more dollars and the price moves up to 34.

757
00:57:55,062 --> 00:57:55,342
Scott: Yep.

758
00:57:55,803 --> 00:58:00,331
Scott: Whereas in 18XX, it's like you can sell five shares all at once.

759
00:58:00,511 --> 00:58:05,700
Scott: You get the list price for all those shares and then the price moves down a whole bunch.

760
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:06,161
Scott: Which I guess.

761
00:58:06,221 --> 00:58:10,126
Rym: in olden times and shitty early stock markets, you could do stuff like that.

762
00:58:10,667 --> 00:58:20,660
Rym: I sell Scott a share and then before Scott can tell anyone, I send a rider on a horse to sell Joey Jojo a share and I sell them both the shares at the same price.

763
00:58:21,002 --> 00:58:23,540
Rym: And until they talk to each other, they have no idea they got screwed.

764
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:24,741
Scott: Right.

765
00:58:24,761 --> 00:58:30,652
Scott: But in 18XX, if the price of a company is 100 and you got four shares, you can sell all four and get $400.

766
00:58:30,652 --> 00:58:34,980
Scott: In this game, it's like, no, you go around buying or selling one share at a time.

767
00:58:35,501 --> 00:58:40,491
Scott: The only annoying rule is you can't sell the final share of a company if no one else has a share in it.

768
00:58:41,854 --> 00:58:44,880
Scott: And then, yeah, you can just buy one, sell one, buy one, sell one.

769
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:47,795
Scott: But obviously if you buy, sell, buy, sell, you're just losing hemorrhage.

770
00:58:47,815 --> 00:58:48,660
Scott: You're just hemorrhaging money.

771
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:51,210
Rym: Just like in the real stock market, the whole idea of a bid ask.

772
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:53,660
Rym: You know, the spread, there's a bid price and an ask price.

773
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:54,441
Scott: Right.

774
00:58:54,521 --> 00:58:55,624
Scott: The price is 20.

775
00:58:55,624 --> 00:58:56,306
Scott: I'll buy a share.

776
00:58:56,326 --> 00:58:56,927
Scott: Well, you paid 21.

777
00:58:56,927 --> 00:58:57,348
Scott: All right.

778
00:58:57,870 --> 00:58:58,892
Scott: Well, now I'll sell that share.

779
00:58:58,912 --> 00:58:59,694
Scott: Here's $20.

780
00:58:59,694 --> 00:59:00,476
Scott: You lost a dollar.

781
00:59:00,737 --> 00:59:00,957
Scott: Right?

782
00:59:01,077 --> 00:59:01,699
Scott: The price is 20 again.

783
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:05,505
Scott: It's like, uh, so yeah, that's how that works.

784
00:59:05,765 --> 00:59:16,300
Scott: So in order to make, in order to make money in stocks, you need to buy several shares of a company, issue more of them, then issue dividends over a long period of time.

785
00:59:16,981 --> 00:59:17,181
Scott: Right.

786
00:59:17,542 --> 00:59:25,340
Scott: And you have to make sure though, that the total value of the company itself, there's these little charts on each of the stock prices cards, right?

787
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:26,242
Scott: That's why they're unique.

788
00:59:26,783 --> 00:59:33,919
Scott: And it will tell you if your company is this much value at the end of the turn, it will move up one, up two, down one or down two, right?

789
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:37,708
Scott: So the value, the total value of the company's holdings.

790
00:59:38,170 --> 00:59:41,520
Rym: Which is its cash on hand plus the value of all the companies it owns.

791
00:59:42,641 --> 00:59:42,881
Scott: Right.

792
00:59:43,262 --> 00:59:50,720
Scott: The total value of what the company has going on determines relative to its stock price, whether it's undervalued or overvalued and that will move.

793
00:59:50,860 --> 01:00:02,040
Rym: If your company has a ton of cash, but not a lot of companies, you can pay out big dividends and that stock price is going to tank because the investors know that you just have a bunch of cash and you're squandering it.

794
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:06,185
Scott: But if the company has like super low cash, right?

795
01:00:06,626 --> 01:00:14,120
Scott: But has a ton of companies in it, then it's, first of all, those companies are generating probably a lot of synergistic income every turn that you can pay out in dividends.

796
01:00:14,881 --> 01:00:24,540
Scott: But whether they do or not, those companies have value and thus the stock price will move according to that value to the right position regardless of where it started.

797
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:28,906
Scott: It'll slowly get to where it belongs relative to how much it's worth.

798
01:00:29,367 --> 01:00:37,600
Scott: So if you can buy low and sell high, you can make money by selling shares at the right time as long as you were able to issue enough shares.

799
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:39,364
Scott: I made the mistake in the first game.

800
01:00:39,424 --> 01:00:40,426
Scott: I opened a company.

801
01:00:40,446 --> 01:00:42,751
Scott: It had two shares, one for me, one for the bank.

802
01:00:43,793 --> 01:00:44,835
Scott: No one else bought a share.

803
01:00:44,855 --> 01:00:45,918
Scott: I didn't issue more.

804
01:00:45,978 --> 01:00:46,920
Scott: I couldn't buy more.

805
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:53,180
Scott: So my price went way up, but I could never sell my only share of the company, even though it was very valuable.

806
01:00:53,641 --> 01:00:54,417
Rym: Even worse, if you issue...

807
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:57,880
Scott: And I couldn't make any money and I couldn't participate in the auction and then I was done.

808
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:01,409
Rym: If you issue new shares, that drives the price down and it dilutes your dividends.

809
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:04,156
Rym: So if I issue another share, now there's three shares.

810
01:01:04,236 --> 01:01:05,660
Rym: Issue another share, now there's four shares.

811
01:01:05,961 --> 01:01:09,633
Rym: Every time you issue a share, the bank gives the share price to the company.

812
01:01:09,974 --> 01:01:11,138
Rym: like you issued another share.

813
01:01:11,158 --> 01:01:11,680
Rym: It's out there.

814
01:01:12,081 --> 01:01:20,180
Rym: But now if I pay a dividend, if there's five shares out there, a $1 dividend cost me $5 and if I only own one share, I only get one of those dollars.

815
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:21,562
Scott: Right.

816
01:01:21,583 --> 01:01:26,080
Scott: So the things about this game... There's more rules, but that's pretty much the game.

817
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:35,260
Scott: Well, the one key thing is that those private companies that come out in the auction are set up in a deck and they're set up into different sections of different colors.

818
01:01:35,801 --> 01:01:39,351
Scott: And as you get to the... each color is like the next phase of the game, right?

819
01:01:39,612 --> 01:01:42,340
Scott: As the colors are... you get through each set of colors.

820
01:01:43,201 --> 01:01:47,149
Scott: And while each little set is shuffled, the colors are in a certain order.

821
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:51,077
Scott: So the companies just get more expensive as the game goes on.

822
01:01:51,137 --> 01:01:52,500
Scott: The price keeps going up.

823
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:52,901
Scott: And it's huge.

824
01:01:52,921 --> 01:01:57,389
Rym: Like early companies have an income of like $2 and it costs like $8.

825
01:01:57,389 --> 01:02:02,878
Rym: The later companies have an income... like an income of like $12 and they cost like $60 to buy.

826
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:07,718
Scott: There are big, big jumps between the colors, right?

827
01:02:07,798 --> 01:02:08,240
Scott: Big jumps.

828
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:16,016
Scott: So the result of that is that even if you're competing well with the other players in the game, right?

829
01:02:16,296 --> 01:02:18,080
Scott: The game can beat you, right?

830
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:41,000
Scott: If you don't keep enough money in your wallet, if you don't have a way to get money into your personal coffers, and they get to like the next color, the prices on those companies in the next color might be so high that you have no conceivable, no possible route, literally no possible route to ever be able to buy one of those, even if nobody was competing with you in the auctions.

831
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:44,728
Scott: Because you just... it's just like, well, that costs $40 minimum.

832
01:02:45,169 --> 01:02:48,397
Scott: There is no way for me to ever get $40 ever in this game.

833
01:02:48,577 --> 01:02:49,580
Scott: I'm just done, right?

834
01:02:49,941 --> 01:02:55,752
Scott: You have to play this game in such a way that you stay afloat, right?

835
01:02:55,832 --> 01:02:59,880
Scott: It's like you're not fighting with the other people so much, right?

836
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:17,000
Scott: You're trying to tread water and after you successfully continue to tread water as the seas continuously rise and never stop rising, if you can continue treading water and stay alive in the game, then you can fight with the other people and try to dunk their heads up.

837
01:03:17,642 --> 01:03:21,580
Scott: But, if I just, the first game I played, I just drowned on my own.

838
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:22,362
Rym: We both drowned.

839
01:03:22,382 --> 01:03:27,800
Rym: Scott and I just, damn, we both hit a point where, well, there's literally no way for us to ever buy anything for the rest of this game.

840
01:03:29,081 --> 01:03:29,201
Scott: Yep.

841
01:03:29,703 --> 01:03:35,100
Scott: So, I think that the problems I see in this game, because it does have a lot of fun parts, right?

842
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:35,982
Scott: I enjoyed this game.

843
01:03:36,102 --> 01:03:36,943
Rym: I would play it again.

844
01:03:37,023 --> 01:03:37,965
Rym: I want to play it again.

845
01:03:38,025 --> 01:03:46,140
Rym: However, I think it is deeply and fatally flawed in a number of ways that some people may be tolerant of, but I'm definitely not.

846
01:03:46,521 --> 01:03:47,582
Rym: You know in Power Grid?

847
01:03:47,602 --> 01:03:48,844
Rym: We talked about this a long time ago.

848
01:03:49,205 --> 01:03:57,218
Rym: Power Grid's a really fun game, but once you get good at it, like really good at it, the game literally comes down to, I spent 100% of my dollars this turn.

849
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:00,685
Rym: Scott had one dollar left over that turn.

850
01:04:01,086 --> 01:04:04,214
Rym: Scott's probably losing the game now because the game becomes very dollar tight.

851
01:04:04,294 --> 01:04:06,580
Rym: Like, that's the level of granularity of success.

852
01:04:07,061 --> 01:04:11,267
Rym: This game, but Power Grid is only like that at high tiers of play.

853
01:04:11,608 --> 01:04:13,411
Rym: This game is like that no matter what.

854
01:04:13,731 --> 01:04:19,200
Rym: If you are off by a dollar in the first auction, you might just mathematically be eliminated from the game.

855
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:24,215
Scott: Right, so I think that, you know, I'm not opposed to being eliminated from the game.

856
01:04:24,255 --> 01:04:25,400
Scott: I know a lot of people hate player elimination.

857
01:04:25,604 --> 01:04:26,033
Scott: Ah, I love it.

858
01:04:27,321 --> 01:04:30,727
Scott: Right, I think this game, one of its flaws, it doesn't have player elimination.

859
01:04:30,888 --> 01:04:37,360
Scott: It needs it, because you could be stuck in a game where you literally cannot affect the game anymore, but you are not officially eliminated.

860
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:48,259
Scott: And so, if you wanted to play to the official conclusion of the game, every game we've played of this, it has reached a point where we've just said, "Oh yes, obviously that player's won and there's nothing anyone could do about

861
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:48,340
Scott: it.".

862
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:52,185
Scott: Even though the game is far from officially over, and we just end it.

863
01:04:52,586 --> 01:04:56,010
Scott: And it's like, well that's really, that's like you play Monopoly, right?

864
01:04:56,271 --> 01:04:58,353
Scott: Monopoly has the exact same fatal flaw.

865
01:04:58,373 --> 01:04:59,255
Scott: That's the worst thing.

866
01:04:59,275 --> 01:05:02,319
Scott: that is wrong with Monopoly is also wrong with this game.

867
01:05:02,359 --> 01:05:03,240
Scott: That is not a good thing.

868
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:15,312
Rym: Secondly, around, these games definitely are very spreadsheet heavy in that the game itself is very like mathematically pure and you can calculate things, but in some games

869
01:05:15,332 --> 01:05:22,800
Scott: there's no randomness, except for the cards coming from the deck, what order will they appear, and you can see the future on those, so it's not very random.

870
01:05:23,321 --> 01:05:30,811
Rym: But the trouble is, oh lord, total aside, I'll get back to this later, people are commenting on our train game reviews on BoardGameGeek.

871
01:05:32,053 --> 01:05:33,195
Rym: I didn't know that was even a thing.

872
01:05:34,897 --> 01:05:36,980
Rym: Interesting, I'm going to skim those comments in a minute.

873
01:05:37,445 --> 01:05:38,720
Scott: Have fun with that.

874
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:42,845
Rym: Basically, some games, it's just analysis paralysis.

875
01:05:42,885 --> 01:05:53,458
Rym: You can calculate so far, but doing a multi-turn full calculation of all player actions and possibilities will maybe give you a 1% higher chance of winning the game.

876
01:05:53,738 --> 01:05:54,920
Rym: So it's not worth it socially.

877
01:05:56,440 --> 01:06:09,431
Scott: People talk about analysis paralysis a lot, and the usual pattern you see is exactly what Rym described, is that if you play the game and you are good at it, you have some heuristics for what's a good move, what's a bad move, you can play pretty well.

878
01:06:09,511 --> 01:06:21,480
Scott: You can get close to optimal play or maybe even optimal play by making a quick decision or just looking around at your options and sort of picking the best one with various methods.

879
01:06:22,081 --> 01:06:41,400
Scott: But if you sit there and analyze every possible option down to the last dollar, down to every cent, down to the individual victory points, and say, aha, I thought of one that got me four victory points, it only took me 30 seconds to find that move, but I spent 10 minutes, I found a move that gets me five victory points.

880
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:45,462
Rym: Everdell has that problem to the nth degree.

881
01:06:45,803 --> 01:06:55,513
Rym: You literally can just fucking sit there forever, and you might actually find a path through all those unique and semi-unique cards that gets you one more victory point than the other options.

882
01:06:56,053 --> 01:06:58,776
Rym: But that is table stakes in this game.

883
01:06:58,996 --> 01:07:02,340
Rym: You have to do that to even be able to engage with the game.

884
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:29,240
Scott: You have to do analysis, paralysis, math, math, math, math, math, spend a lot of time thinking, down to the last dollar, exactly how much am I going to spend in this auction, what's my turn order, what stock price will I open this company at, how many shares will I issue.

885
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:31,783
Scott: There's so many options of things you can do.

886
01:07:32,624 --> 01:07:46,200
Scott: You have to explore each and every one of them, you know, spreadsheet all the way out before you make your move, because a failure to do so won't mean one less victory point or one less dollar.

887
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:49,348
Rym: It means your chance of victory literally crashes to zero that turn.

888
01:07:49,588 --> 01:07:51,514
Rym: It crashes from 90% to 5% and then from 5% to 0% over two turns.

889
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:53,800
Rym: Right.

890
01:07:54,121 --> 01:08:01,935
Scott: It means, well, that means you're not going to have enough, you know, the next turn, the cheapest private company available will cost a minimum of $21, and you'll have $20, so you can't even participate.

891
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:13,014
Scott: If you even had the, and that's the thing, if you had the $21, right, that could, you know, to buy that cheapest company, you might not buy it.

892
01:08:13,615 --> 01:08:17,241
Scott: Someone else with like $30 might just buy it for $22.

893
01:08:17,241 --> 01:08:18,542
Scott: But you matter.

894
01:08:18,582 --> 01:08:21,265
Scott: You force them to buy that company.

895
01:08:21,465 --> 01:08:25,229
Scott: They couldn't buy another company because that would mean letting you have that one, right?

896
01:08:25,529 --> 01:08:34,680
Scott: If they chose a different company for say, you know, $27 that you couldn't even afford, they got that at face value, but now they're giving you the $21 at face value helping you out a ton.

897
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:39,245
Scott: So now they have to buy that $21 to keep you out of it, right?

898
01:08:39,906 --> 01:08:51,220
Scott: And when they do so, they have to buy it for $22 above face value because to not bid $22 would mean you could get it in there for $21 based on the turn order possibly, right?

899
01:08:51,700 --> 01:09:00,380
Scott: So having enough money to just clear that edge every single time requires a lot of analysis just to stay in the game.

900
01:09:00,881 --> 01:09:01,060
Rym: Yeah.

901
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:12,680
Rym: But even then, even if, even once you get to that point, because the game is so dollar tight, what'll happen is even if you make a slight miscalculation, but otherwise you're staying ahead of that ledge, like you're playing the game well.

902
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:16,767
Rym: You've learned it, you're spread sheeting it, you're doing your math, you're not going to get screwed.

903
01:09:16,807 --> 01:09:19,152
Rym: Like you can engage in the game meaningfully all the way to the end.

904
01:09:19,171 --> 01:09:23,439
Rym: You're behind by $2 of net worth by the third round.

905
01:09:23,779 --> 01:09:24,502
Rym: You'll never catch up.

906
01:09:24,542 --> 01:09:33,236
Rym: There's no way to catch up because since the game is so locked tight, while there's this, like I could make a million corporations, corporations can sell stuff between each other.

907
01:09:33,576 --> 01:09:35,859
Rym: There's all this stuff that can happen in the stock market.

908
01:09:36,020 --> 01:09:41,760
Rym: I could like unload a company that sucks on someone and then like sell all the stock and do cool stuff.

909
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:52,620
Scott: Someone could be trying to start a new company and buy all the privates from their old company into the new one and you could try to buy that old company out before they're able to transfer and steal all the private companies.

910
01:09:52,859 --> 01:09:59,209
Rym: They issue extra shares, but in practice, and I was looking around online and it's not just our games.

911
01:09:59,249 --> 01:10:00,330
Rym: It seems like that's pretty common.

912
01:10:00,751 --> 01:10:07,860
Rym: Very rarely do shenanigans like that happen because they can't often happen if the players are all actually playing well.

913
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:18,780
Rym: They seem to only happen in games of this where all the players are doing very badly or for whatever reason, some of the players are making very poor decisions.

914
01:10:20,180 --> 01:10:28,673
Scott: Yes, if you, like we said, do all that analysis, you can basically protect yourself from any sort of shenanigans that could possibly happen.

915
01:10:28,693 --> 01:10:33,000
Scott: There's no really like an attack someone can do that you can't defend against.

916
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:40,151
Scott: The only thing that someone can do in this game is to gang up on you with some sort of politics situation.

917
01:10:40,611 --> 01:10:46,400
Scott: Some cooperations of people who are not in first place could unseat someone in first place.

918
01:10:46,701 --> 01:10:50,047
Scott: Put their monies together in some way.

919
01:10:50,348 --> 01:10:56,400
Scott: Just like someone who has been mathematically eliminated from the game early could do some king making in this game.

920
01:10:58,742 --> 01:11:07,340
Scott: I like a king making, but I only like it personally when the king making happens and the person doing the king making still has a chance to win.

921
01:11:08,462 --> 01:11:09,834
Rym: Yeah, I see where you're going with that.

922
01:11:11,001 --> 01:11:13,226
Scott: They've chosen this political path through the game.

923
01:11:13,647 --> 01:11:18,580
Scott: even though they could, they themselves could still win after following that path.

924
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:28,840
Scott: If somebody king makes and either a) sacrifices all their chance to win to do so or b) king makes after already having crossed the point where they could no longer win.

925
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,084
Scott: Like, "Well, I can't win this game.

926
01:11:30,385 --> 01:11:34,019
Scott: I'm gonna put all my stuff in with Rym to make him win or to make Rym

927
01:11:34,059 --> 01:11:34,340
Scott: lose.".

928
01:11:34,661 --> 01:11:38,977
Scott: That just seems like a spoiler and it's like now you're not winning and losing based on your own merit.

929
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:53,760
Rym: If you're behind but you've played competently, you're not just derping around in the game, then holding back winners and just trying to keep the game going gives you some chance, some avenue to sneak a win in if everyone else stalemates.

930
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:57,819
Rym: There are still more plausible paths to victory than in games like this.

931
01:11:58,402 --> 01:12:03,280
Rym: But there's also this problem that I see where there's all these shenanigans that seem really fun.

932
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:12,720
Rym: Like in 18 XX games, the most fun thing in the world to do is to fuck someone over and force them to buy a train or force someone to own a company they don't want to own.

933
01:12:13,261 --> 01:12:18,320
Rym: But if the players are even remotely careful, you really can't pull that off.

934
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:19,980
Scott: Nope.

935
01:12:20,563 --> 01:12:23,820
Scott: It only happens to people who are new at the game or don't know what's up.

936
01:12:24,865 --> 01:12:28,000
Scott: Once I learned that, it took me quite a while to figure out how that worked.

937
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:30,011
Scott: But basically that doesn't happen to me anymore.

938
01:12:30,213 --> 01:12:31,200
Scott: I'm like perfectly protected.

939
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:32,930
Rym: You can't throw a shitty company at me in 1889.

940
01:12:32,930 --> 01:12:34,640
Rym: Like it just can't happen.

941
01:12:36,020 --> 01:12:36,903
Scott: Nope.

942
01:12:37,024 --> 01:12:41,280
Scott: I know how it works now and now it never happens and I can't do it to anyone else because they know better.

943
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:48,619
Rym: But then we get into a situation where I like the train game, but the most fun of the table is when the turn starts and someone says, "Oh shit, I see what's about to

944
01:12:48,679 --> 01:12:48,940
Rym: happen.".

945
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:53,120
Rym: And then someone gets screwed by that, but you never see that happen when everyone's good.

946
01:12:53,501 --> 01:12:54,900
Rym: Again, unless people are making mistakes.

947
01:12:55,360 --> 01:13:03,320
Rym: So we have this broader problem of there are fun systems and levers in these games, much like Sellers of Catan where trading is really fun.

948
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:06,691
Rym: Where if you get good at the game, you'd never pull that lever again.

949
01:13:06,771 --> 01:13:08,155
Rym: Like you know that lever is just poison.

950
01:13:08,175 --> 01:13:09,158
Rym: There's no reason to ever touch it.

951
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:15,400
Scott: Well, it's like, you know, I think baseball actually is an example of a game that has a lot of the same things going on.

952
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:28,820
Scott: If you ever watch a Little League Baseball game, something that happens a lot in not the lowest level of Little League, which is just kids who aren't, but like the middle school kids who like could be really good high school players might be-

953
01:13:29,180 --> 01:13:32,880
Rym: Like they're trying, but they can't hit home runs yet because they're tiny, tiny kids.

954
01:13:33,401 --> 01:13:35,365
Scott: Well, they can in the little tiny field.

955
01:13:35,486 --> 01:13:41,640
Scott: But the point is some things that you'll see happen, for example, are like successful steals of home, right?

956
01:13:42,041 --> 01:13:45,068
Scott: Some things else that you'll see is that kids will get a walk, right?

957
01:13:45,128 --> 01:13:46,491
Scott: So the pitcher will walk the batter.

958
01:13:46,511 --> 01:13:50,500
Scott: The kid will run to first base, even though they just got walked.

959
01:13:51,521 --> 01:13:54,286
Scott: And they'll just keep running to second, like without stopping.

960
01:13:54,767 --> 01:13:58,314
Scott: And this will often fool a pitcher, right?

961
01:13:58,374 --> 01:14:01,600
Scott: Who is not, you know, who's just a kid who isn't aware of that.

962
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:13,000
Rym: In high school, my go-to move was I would walk casually toward first when I got walked, and then I'd walk a little bit past it, and then I would just suddenly sprint to second and no one ever was able to stop me.

963
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:13,521
Scott: Right.

964
01:14:13,541 --> 01:14:16,407
Scott: In Major League Baseball, you see that never.

965
01:14:16,547 --> 01:14:27,260
Rym: You haven't seen stealing home in like, it's super, super rare, but it hasn't been common since- Like if a pickle happens in a professional baseball game, that is the highlight of the fucking month.

966
01:14:28,662 --> 01:14:29,405
Scott: Right, exactly.

967
01:14:29,425 --> 01:14:30,571
Scott: It happens pretty rarely.

968
01:14:30,591 --> 01:14:32,400
Scott: Pickles happen a little bit, but they're still pretty rare these days.

969
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:39,340
Rym: But even not that often, pickles are one of the most fun parts of baseball, but they really can't happen unless you make a mistake.

970
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:41,762
Scott: Right, so that's what I'm saying.

971
01:14:41,802 --> 01:14:46,669
Scott: is that rolling stock, even if your players aren't pro, right?

972
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:49,514
Scott: Because the bar to just stay in.

973
01:14:49,554 --> 01:14:53,300
Scott: the game is high, anyone who's not pro can't do anything in this game.

974
01:14:53,621 --> 01:14:59,534
Scott: So as a result, you only get the game where everyone's pro and only boring stuff happens, right?

975
01:14:59,574 --> 01:15:00,236
Scott: The exciting stuff.

976
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:02,200
Scott: I'm really curious, right?

977
01:15:02,501 --> 01:15:05,480
Scott: I mean, I have tons of ideas on how to sort of take the core of these games to a different game.

978
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:09,600
Rym: Yeah, and if you didn't notice, we're playing a lot of these games lately for research for an idea we have.

979
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:14,411
Scott: Yeah, but I'm just thinking like, what if you just, instead of making the game money tight, right?

980
01:15:14,731 --> 01:15:18,340
Scott: What if everyone started the game with like a fucking thousand dollars, right?

981
01:15:18,701 --> 01:15:19,824
Scott: Just don't change anything else.

982
01:15:19,864 --> 01:15:21,970
Scott: Just make everyone a fucking tycoon.

983
01:15:22,010 --> 01:15:22,632
Scott: Like you're rich.

984
01:15:22,692 --> 01:15:23,454
Scott: Money's not tight.

985
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:25,500
Scott: Alright, now bid on these companies, right?

986
01:15:25,580 --> 01:15:29,580
Scott: It's like if you don't do, it doesn't matter how much money you start with as long as everyone starts the same.

987
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:36,100
Scott: And it's like, well, you can't just sit on your thousand dollars because if you want to win, you have to increase your money somehow.

988
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:42,680
Rym: But also it means now there's a lot more dynamics around issuing more shares and buying shares and fucking other people's shares over.

989
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:44,442
Scott: Everyone's rich.

990
01:15:44,462 --> 01:15:47,450
Scott: You can't kick anyone out of the game because they're all fucking rich.

991
01:15:47,791 --> 01:15:50,820
Scott: You just have to work the system to make more money than someone else.

992
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:54,245
Scott: Despite being more rich, right?

993
01:15:54,266 --> 01:15:55,629
Scott: That you can't kick anyone out.

994
01:15:55,669 --> 01:15:56,752
Scott: They're not going to go bankrupt.

995
01:15:56,832 --> 01:15:57,614
Scott: They're a zillionaire.

996
01:15:57,654 --> 01:15:58,577
Scott: Everyone's a zillionaire.

997
01:15:58,597 --> 01:15:59,840
Scott: You're feuding tycoons.

998
01:16:00,441 --> 01:16:04,740
Scott: But you still have to play the game because you still have to make, get to a thousand and one dollars somehow.

999
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:06,740
Scott: Like what did- You're not going to get it by sitting.

1000
01:16:06,740 --> 01:16:09,560
Scott: But instead- Unless you hope everyone else loses money and you'll just sit.

1001
01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:15,440
Rym: Which is what disappoints me the most is we can form all these companies, but there's almost never a reason to form more of them.

1002
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:21,279
Scott: You're like, you can't- Later in the game there is, but there isn't a reason to form like a whole bunch.

1003
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:27,280
Scott: It's like you could legally form like five companies right away, but like that won't do anything except make you lose.

1004
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:31,580
Rym: And in fact, in the last game we played, I formed a big company that's actually doing really well late game.

1005
01:16:32,201 --> 01:16:33,125
Rym: Only because why not?

1006
01:16:33,225 --> 01:16:36,780
Rym: I mean, I was already guaranteed losing the game and it was just a system I could interact with.

1007
01:16:37,142 --> 01:16:39,719
Rym: Starcorp doesn't matter or mean anything to anyone.

1008
01:16:42,042 --> 01:16:47,240
Scott: The first game I played, I started the company and I followed the basic heuristic of trying to make a stock price go up.

1009
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:47,781
Scott: So I did.

1010
01:16:47,881 --> 01:16:50,448
Scott: I got a company and it made its stock price go way, way up.

1011
01:16:50,509 --> 01:16:53,798
Scott: I was trying to roleplay a responsible corporate executive.

1012
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:56,120
Rym: Now you got to roleplay a jerk.

1013
01:16:57,524 --> 01:17:00,500
Scott: And that absolutely did not work and I just got completely screwed.

1014
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:10,480
Scott: So it's like the, not only do you have to spreadsheet the whole game to stay in it, but your basic, you know, real world heuristics of own a company and make the stock price go up.

1015
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:11,086
Scott: That's good.

1016
01:17:11,167 --> 01:17:12,500
Scott: It's like, no, it's not, right?

1017
01:17:12,881 --> 01:17:16,460
Scott: You have to do, non-intuitive things are the way forward, right?

1018
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:19,600
Rym: Of course, Chris points out in the chat that I kind of agree with.

1019
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:29,600
Rym: If you started people with too much money in this game, I feel like never investing and never doing anything except maybe buying a couple of companies would actually be an optimal strategy because of the math.

1020
01:17:31,922 --> 01:17:39,800
Rym: Cause I remember this happened when I was a kid in middle school, this one random day, it was in like the eighth grade advanced math class and they busted out monopoly.

1021
01:17:40,162 --> 01:17:42,720
Rym: They made us break into groups and they were like, everyone play monopoly.

1022
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:49,480
Rym: And, uh, the winner from each table will like get a lottery ticket to get a thing.

1023
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:53,840
Rym: Like there was a prize, like there's a real prize that people wanted, like a serious prize.

1024
01:17:53,921 --> 01:17:55,238
Rym: I don't remember what the prize was.

1025
01:17:55,782 --> 01:17:59,900
Rym: It was like, it was, it was like the equivalent of like, don't have to do homework for a couple of weeks.

1026
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,059
Rym: Like it was some big deal thing.

1027
01:18:01,501 --> 01:18:05,740
Rym: So everyone starts trying to play monopoly and at our table, I'm like, guys, monopoly sucks.

1028
01:18:06,202 --> 01:18:07,054
Rym: We don't want to play it.

1029
01:18:07,821 --> 01:18:10,640
Rym: Uh, let's show, and there was a secondary prize.

1030
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:11,319
Rym: Here's the other piece.

1031
01:18:11,621 --> 01:18:18,760
Rym: The secondary prize was whatever player had the most money among all the winners would win some other prize in addition.

1032
01:18:20,021 --> 01:18:24,780
Rym: So I just said, let's all just agree that we never take any actions in this game.

1033
01:18:25,002 --> 01:18:26,940
Rym: There's a guaranteed five way tie for first.

1034
01:18:27,381 --> 01:18:32,338
Rym: And all we do is go around collecting the $200 from go over and over and over again.

1035
01:18:34,241 --> 01:18:35,223
Scott: Oh yeah.

1036
01:18:35,824 --> 01:18:43,660
Rym: And uh, yeah, we made sure there was a five way tie at our table and we had an order of magnitude more money than anyone else.

1037
01:18:44,085 --> 01:18:45,080
Rym: And the prize was canceled.

1038
01:18:45,180 --> 01:18:46,554
Rym: Everything was called off and we all got in trouble.

1039
01:18:48,241 --> 01:18:50,397
Scott: Well, they should have thought about what they were doing.

1040
01:18:51,781 --> 01:18:56,500
Scott: I would have, I would, if I saw kids doing that, I would be like, you got you guys, I'm getting you five prizes.

1041
01:18:57,661 --> 01:18:57,842
Rym: Yeah.

1042
01:18:57,862 --> 01:19:01,900
Rym: That if I were a teacher, I would definitely reward the kids who were subversive in clever ways.

1043
01:19:03,441 --> 01:19:11,019
Scott: I mean, we could, that's, I think our show is over, but definitely there is, you know, they think one of the great injustices of that.

1044
01:19:11,761 --> 01:19:14,307
Scott: I think a lot of Pete nerds, especially right.

1045
01:19:14,327 --> 01:19:20,020
Scott: I've experienced in American school is adults punishing children for children being smarter.

1046
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:21,065
Scott: It's like, you're there to learn.

1047
01:19:21,286 --> 01:19:23,740
Scott: And then they punish you for knowing more than adults do right.

1048
01:19:24,340 --> 01:19:30,080
Scott: A good adults will reward children who are smart, outsmart adults and say, good job.

1049
01:19:30,503 --> 01:19:32,960
Scott: As long as the kids didn't cause harm that much.

1050
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:38,480
Rym: The reward could be like the teacher aside being like, yo kid, you don't have to do homework for the next two weeks.

1051
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:40,466
Rym: Don't tell anyone that would have been enough.

1052
01:19:40,587 --> 01:19:44,800
Rym: I would have stopped causing trouble, but yeah, rolling stock.

1053
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:50,320
Rym: If you want to play this game, rolling stock.net has an online implementation because the game is so abstract.

1054
01:19:51,181 --> 01:19:52,949
Rym: It's you don't need anything.

1055
01:19:52,969 --> 01:19:54,255
Rym: The fiction of this game is meeting.

1056
01:19:54,296 --> 01:19:54,637
Rym: No, no, no.

1057
01:19:55,601 --> 01:19:55,782
Scott: Yes.

1058
01:19:55,822 --> 01:20:00,700
Scott: You can read a PDF to get the complete, the sever as a few PDFs that are available to read the whole rules.

1059
01:20:00,860 --> 01:20:02,486
Scott: And then you can play online for free.

1060
01:20:02,927 --> 01:20:06,779
Scott: If you want to play this online for free, contact us and we'll play, I'll play with you.

1061
01:20:07,662 --> 01:20:13,320
Scott: Uh, well we can chat and we can talk to you and I'll give you tips based on my two or three plays of it.

1062
01:20:13,660 --> 01:20:18,509
Scott: But I think the game is only much like the 18XX games.

1063
01:20:18,789 --> 01:20:25,040
Rym: I like it, but I think it is fatally and deeply flawed in specific and profound ways.

1064
01:20:25,601 --> 01:20:30,880
Rym: While I enjoy it and it's interesting, it is more instructive than it is enjoyable.

1065
01:20:31,221 --> 01:20:34,672
Rym: Like I am learning things about game design playing these games.

1066
01:20:35,134 --> 01:20:37,020
Rym: I'm also seeing the flaws in them.

1067
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:48,600
Rym: And I still feel like doing 18XX games and this, there is a game that can be made that is good in the traditional sense, not just good in the "I want to bang my head against the spreadsheet and see what happens" sense.

1068
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:49,820
Scott: Right.

1069
01:20:49,881 --> 01:20:58,240
Scott: Well, I think that's because all these games have in common some core mechanics that do not exist at all in other genres of games.

1070
01:20:59,000 --> 01:20:59,461
Scott: Period.

1071
01:20:59,702 --> 01:20:59,962
Scott: Right?

1072
01:21:00,343 --> 01:21:10,280
Scott: And so if we can extract those and just fix all the stuff around them and get rid of the problems, then you can make a truly unique, amazing, popular game.

1073
01:21:10,300 --> 01:21:14,586
Rym: Which I still think comes down to, you can't actually be a tabletop game.

1074
01:21:14,606 --> 01:21:25,720
Rym: It needs to have primarily tabletop sensibility, but real-time markets or slightly more complex stock markets that don't have fiddly rules, like no two companies can be the same price at the same time.

1075
01:21:26,402 --> 01:21:29,109
Rym: That would go a long way toward making this better.

1076
01:21:29,209 --> 01:21:32,318
Scott: I think there are ways to do it, but anyway, let's go find something.

1077
01:21:32,358 --> 01:21:32,980
Rym: Yeah, I'm getting hungry.

1078
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:36,446
Rym: So yeah, stay safe out there, enjoy some rolling stock.

1079
01:21:36,487 --> 01:21:42,820
Rym: If you guys want to play, we will play a game and we can all be in misery together as literally no one can afford the last companies.

1080
01:21:48,950 --> 01:21:51,176
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1081
01:21:51,236 --> 01:21:56,230
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1082
01:21:56,591 --> 01:22:01,630
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1083
01:22:01,970 --> 01:22:04,577
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1084
01:22:04,697 --> 01:22:09,290
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1085
01:22:09,710 --> 01:22:13,657
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1086
01:22:14,078 --> 01:22:17,164
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1087
01:22:17,365 --> 01:22:20,250
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1088
01:22:22,483 --> 01:22:54,720
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights are... And a whole bunch of people who do not want me to say their name.

1089
01:22:56,161 --> 01:22:58,346
Rym: You may notice I stutter in these from time to time.

1090
01:22:58,426 --> 01:23:04,260
Rym: The new interface actually only shows the first, like, 10 or 11 characters of your names.

1091
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:07,769
Rym: And I actually have to hover over each one to get a tooltip to see the full name.

1092
01:23:08,271 --> 01:23:11,220
Rym: Or I have to export a CSV, which I am far too lazy to do.

1093
01:23:12,441 --> 01:23:17,740
Rym: We're going to try some new stuff with the stream to get the sync a little bit better and maybe up the quality a little bit.

1094
01:23:18,081 --> 01:23:20,407
Rym: We're working on some ways to do live panels.

1095
01:23:21,209 --> 01:23:25,080
Rym: As you might have heard a little bit of, Scott and I are thinking about doing a dueling panels contest.

1096
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:32,440
Rym: Where each of us is going to put together a solo video panel or video essay and then we'll just fight to see which one of us did a better one.

1097
01:23:33,020 --> 01:23:34,326
Rym: But all that's in the future.

1098
01:23:34,688 --> 01:23:36,476
Rym: For now, I leave you with...
