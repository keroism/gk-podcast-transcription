1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,830
Rym: It's Thursday October 8th 2020.

2
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:15,059
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:15,079 --> 00:00:19,538
Rym: tonight We are reviewing the 2020 movie vampires versus the Bronx.

4
00:00:20,922 --> 00:00:21,653
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:26,002 --> 00:00:36,215
Rym: So, uh, we were gonna do a show on Tuesday on Star Wars portraits because like that's that's a game we have wanted to exist forever and it's about as good as I hoped it could be.

6
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:37,459
Rym: like there's a lot to say.

7
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:44,516
Rym: I There's a big review we want to do but couldn't do the review because I had a plumbing instant as you might have seen me tweet about.

8
00:00:45,884 --> 00:00:56,723
Rym: so basically Sunday night, we're doing our movie night with our friends to watch this movie that we're gonna review and toward the end of that movie A noise happens.

9
00:00:56,743 --> 00:00:58,528
Rym: There's a noise coming from what.

10
00:00:58,688 --> 00:00:59,510
Scott: what noise was it?

11
00:00:59,992 --> 00:01:03,280
Rym: sort of a burbling noise coming from the purple.

12
00:01:04,321 --> 00:01:12,100
Rym: Okay, yeah, so go over and look and there is just sewer water coming up out of the drain like slowly filling the sink.

13
00:01:12,962 --> 00:01:25,620
Scott: So the only way that can happen is if there is a clog beneath but there is still something Landing on that clog water right coming from above because it can't come from below magically, right?

14
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:26,502
Scott: Well, it there has to be.

15
00:01:26,663 --> 00:01:27,566
Rym: what can?

16
00:01:28,028 --> 00:01:31,700
Rym: that's why in some places, you know that whole thing about the basement toilets.

17
00:01:32,084 --> 00:01:33,659
Rym: That's what those basement toilets are for.

18
00:01:34,103 --> 00:01:38,388
Rym: So if the sewer just comes up it'll flood your basement instead of but the sewer.

19
00:01:38,488 --> 00:01:45,190
Scott: the sewer coming up means that the sewer itself is clogged and water is coming into The sewer hitting that clog and backing up right?

20
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,455
Rym: Yeah, which can't happen.

21
00:01:46,515 --> 00:01:47,640
Rym: I've seen that happen.

22
00:01:47,881 --> 00:01:49,125
Scott: I've explained yeah, but it's not.

23
00:01:49,426 --> 00:01:55,386
Scott: but it's not water coming up right like from say the ocean Whatever the s at the end.

24
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:56,671
Rym: Well, it's water coming up from water.

25
00:01:56,892 --> 00:02:04,060
Scott: It's um, the water comes down From above gets stuck and it keeps coming and it fills up.

26
00:02:04,181 --> 00:02:05,339
Rym: So that was the case here.

27
00:02:05,661 --> 00:02:14,339
Rym: But it is possible for water to be pressurized from the sewer itself and fight its way back up Especially depending on the plumbing is with no no clog beneath it.

28
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:29,179
Rym: Yes That happens in a lot of terrifying situations that are thankfully not relevant here then also are rare in places like New York City but are kind of common in More rural places and suburban places with old plug.

29
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,440
Scott: So the clog wasn't just in your sink because it was just in your sink.

30
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,879
Scott: It would only come back up if you turned your water exactly.

31
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,144
Rym: This wasn't like it was.

32
00:02:37,986 --> 00:02:42,099
Rym: I clog the sink and now I can't put water down and if I it's like

33
00:02:46,702 --> 00:03:02,178
Scott: The clog is somewhere at the next level of plumbing and someone else has their water on and that water is hitting that clog and Filling up the pipe and coming out of your drain Because all the drains are connected which means other drains should also be having the same problem.

34
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:17,536
Rym: Not right necessarily because Billis apartment buildings can sometimes have surprisingly complex plumbing systems and From the information I had it was very difficult to figure out where exactly the pipes go.

35
00:03:17,857 --> 00:03:18,840
Rym: who shares things?

36
00:03:19,182 --> 00:03:31,573
Rym: I have learned now that our apartment is the lowest point On the line where if there's a clog in that line Before beneath the second floor is like connection to that line.

37
00:03:32,014 --> 00:03:34,100
Rym: Our apartment will flood and no one else will.

38
00:03:35,104 --> 00:03:38,260
Rym: So basically there's always one point that is like that in any site, right?

39
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:43,136
Scott: So you're the lowest on the totem pole of flooding in that it's here like yes.

40
00:03:43,297 --> 00:03:45,523
Rym: Yeah, so I Wasn't.

41
00:03:45,603 --> 00:03:47,170
Scott: it wasn't a building wide clog.

42
00:03:47,231 --> 00:03:49,240
Scott: It was probably someone on your floor.

43
00:03:49,661 --> 00:03:51,487
Rym: Yeah, almost definitely what has been happening?

44
00:03:51,508 --> 00:03:55,200
Rym: because this happened once at the beginning of quarantine.

45
00:03:55,562 --> 00:03:57,132
Rym: Remember when my dishwasher broke.

46
00:03:57,353 --> 00:03:58,399
Rym: what happened was one day.

47
00:03:58,842 --> 00:04:19,345
Rym: so when this I was thinking this is the same thing because I one day I was just like Fucking around in the kitchen and suddenly a bunch of what is clearly industrial drain cleaner comes up out of the sink Like it was acid drain cleaner like not that because when you buy a consumer drain cleaner it's usually a strong base like Drano, but Professional drain cleaner.

48
00:04:19,404 --> 00:04:22,115
Rym: you can get both kinds and there is a professional drain cleaner.

49
00:04:22,135 --> 00:04:25,612
Rym: That's basically just Hydrochloric acid mixed with some stuff.

50
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:28,400
Rym: It was clearly that All right.

51
00:04:28,621 --> 00:04:34,680
Rym: So in that case someone else probably had a clog and probably tried to deal with it instead of calling the super.

52
00:04:35,283 --> 00:04:36,428
Rym: So it came up.

53
00:04:36,489 --> 00:04:38,016
Rym: our sink called the super.

54
00:04:38,076 --> 00:04:38,779
Rym: they dealt with it.

55
00:04:39,181 --> 00:04:49,040
Rym: That's what destroyed the impeller motor in our dishwasher and we didn't have a dishwasher for much of the early days of quarantine Which was fantastic because we were cooking more than we'd ever cooked in the decade of living here, but whatever.

56
00:04:49,683 --> 00:04:54,383
Rym: So soon as this happens, I call I go downstairs and I tell it that like hey like hey We need some help.

57
00:04:54,564 --> 00:04:57,136
Rym: waters coming up ends and the water just kept coming.

58
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:57,800
Rym: It didn't stop.

59
00:04:58,121 --> 00:05:00,487
Rym: It was filling the dishwasher and the sink.

60
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:04,237
Scott: they means that somebody didn't turn their like water off.

61
00:05:04,297 --> 00:05:06,905
Scott: Someone was running water Right above.

62
00:05:06,925 --> 00:05:15,711
Scott: Yeah, right and it was coming all the way down hitting the clog and then filling up the pie Basically anyone above us in the column that supports our kitchen.

63
00:05:16,012 --> 00:05:19,000
Rym: luckily the bathrooms are a separate system thankfully, so there's no problem.

64
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,482
Scott: That's good.

65
00:05:19,523 --> 00:05:22,919
Rym: Okay, anytime anyone use their sink at all our water level just rise.

66
00:05:24,001 --> 00:05:29,700
Rym: Yeah, there was no way to fix this because it's very hard to get emergency plumbers right now in New York because of the quarantine.

67
00:05:30,222 --> 00:05:37,869
Scott: So you have to tell every single person don't use your kitchen water at all up and the building Said they were gonna do that, but they didn't.

68
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:40,180
Rym: I also overheard when they were talking in Spanish.

69
00:05:41,002 --> 00:05:48,342
Rym: I'm pretty sure they have no way to shut off the hot water anywhere in the building because there are several broken valves Mm-hmm.

70
00:05:48,845 --> 00:05:50,171
Rym: That's just an interesting tidbit.

71
00:05:50,191 --> 00:06:03,995
Rym: I'm gonna remember for the future, but basically what they ended up doing is giving us a shop vac and Emily stayed up all night like literally all night watching the sink cuz about every 15 minutes.

72
00:06:04,015 --> 00:06:10,159
Rym: we have to shop vac out the sink and Shop vac out the dishwasher to prevent our apartment from flooding roll.

73
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,936
Scott: I wonder if there's some way that you can make some sort of a claim either.

74
00:06:14,016 --> 00:06:14,880
Scott: renters insurance?

75
00:06:15,181 --> 00:06:24,920
Rym: I could but I would have to sue the landlord and Do a bunch of stuff with lawyers that would cost me more than what I could get back because the most or just I could withhold.

76
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:25,686
Scott: You got to sue.

77
00:06:25,726 --> 00:06:27,640
Scott: you could just talk to the landlord first.

78
00:06:27,781 --> 00:06:31,136
Rym: I have this landlord give a shit landlord basically said take it up with the super.

79
00:06:31,156 --> 00:06:35,159
Rym: so unless I sue them There's nothing they will ever do All right, well, yep.

80
00:06:35,682 --> 00:06:39,315
Rym: So, uh all night Emily is shot back in this thing because we can't just leave it.

81
00:06:39,335 --> 00:06:41,588
Scott: because if we ignore it the sinkers Well, then what do you do?

82
00:06:41,648 --> 00:06:42,719
Scott: in the shop vac fills up?

83
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:43,583
Scott: And why do people?

84
00:06:43,683 --> 00:06:49,860
Rym: why are people running their water at night in their kitchen people if around 3 or 4 a.m They pretty much stopped running their water?

85
00:06:50,221 --> 00:06:56,206
Rym: And the only reason Emily had to stay up the rest of the night was just in case like couldn't risk that Can't risk that disaster.

86
00:06:56,707 --> 00:07:05,160
Rym: So every time we filled the shop vac, which was like every couple every two times this happened We'd roll it into the elevator and the night doorman knew about the situation.

87
00:07:05,321 --> 00:07:12,713
Rym: I was helping us out and he would go drain it in like the like the Industrial sinks in the building and send it back up the elevator for us.

88
00:07:13,216 --> 00:07:24,711
Rym: Why don't you just send it down the bathtub toilet, uh That actually would have been a giant pain because I would have had to run the shop vac in reverse or lift the Extremely heavy shop vac filled with water.

89
00:07:24,731 --> 00:07:26,340
Scott: You don't lift it you run in reverse.

90
00:07:26,521 --> 00:07:28,531
Rym: Yeah, running it in reverse who spews?

91
00:07:28,712 --> 00:07:30,240
Rym: because it's shot backs tend to leak a lot.

92
00:07:30,601 --> 00:07:32,671
Scott: I was not gonna get into a bet into a bathtub.

93
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:34,580
Rym: Yeah, that that was not gonna fly.

94
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:36,352
Rym: So we did this whole like shuttle operation.

95
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:42,560
Rym: all night in the morning Emily fell asleep and I kept an eye on it for the next like five hours while I was trying to get work done.

96
00:07:42,661 --> 00:07:44,500
Scott: Well in the morning, it probably started going real.

97
00:07:44,681 --> 00:07:45,524
Rym: Oh, I was just.

98
00:07:45,604 --> 00:07:51,900
Rym: I was just shot back and constantly and at one point while I was waiting for the shop vac to come back I was bailing water into the bathtub with a bucket.

99
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,815
Rym: So eventually around like noon the plumber at the emergency plumber actually shows up.

100
00:07:59,217 --> 00:08:03,540
Scott: and could you have Could you have right take the top off the shop vac?

101
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:14,089
Scott: right and run a run a hose from the bottom of the shop vac to the bathtubs to carry a constant I We if this were my house, that is what I would have done.

102
00:08:14,731 --> 00:08:25,731
Rym: The building did not have any tubes long enough to do that like when you were kids like I remember we had floods like that in our house and we had like an industrial shop vac and We would do exactly what you described like that's.

103
00:08:26,133 --> 00:08:40,544
Scott: oh, we actually didn't have a shop vac but what we did have was we actually had a Water pump that you would use to fill or empty the pool the swimming pool Yeah And it's basically just a thing that floats in the pool and you attach a garden hose to it and a power cable to it And it pumps water out the hose.

104
00:08:41,027 --> 00:08:46,425
Rym: Oh, yeah, we are actually cheated with filling the pools because you know My dad was a fire could have put that.

105
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:51,208
Scott: you could have put that in the sink with a garden hose running over to the Tub and just turn it on.

106
00:08:51,228 --> 00:08:52,356
Rym: my dad was a fireman.

107
00:08:52,578 --> 00:08:57,640
Rym: one time We filled our pool by just plugging in the fire hose and run it over to the pool and it filled the pool.

108
00:08:57,962 --> 00:08:59,652
Scott: That saves a lot of time.

109
00:08:59,692 --> 00:09:01,060
Scott: we did with the garden hose took forever.

110
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:05,000
Rym: Oh, yeah, if we filled the pool in like an hour like done like yeah, it was amazing.

111
00:09:05,802 --> 00:09:08,720
Rym: That was probably super illegal, but whatever statute of limitations.

112
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,303
Rym: Oh, is it?

113
00:09:10,026 --> 00:09:12,740
Scott: I assume from the bed is mean from the from the fire hydrant?

114
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,127
Rym: Well one we didn't pay that water bill because there's no fire hydrant.

115
00:09:15,147 --> 00:09:19,299
Rym: and two that is definitely a misappropriation of civic infrastructure.

116
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,488
Rym: Yeah, of course I repair.

117
00:09:23,528 --> 00:09:26,679
Rym: we had to paint that fire hydrant ourselves because it was on our property.

118
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:36,593
Rym: so Anyway, so, uh, eventually the plumber comes and sends us and he explained to me the layout Like I know the layout now of the building and like where all the pipes go.

119
00:09:36,654 --> 00:09:38,100
Rym: cuz he's the plumbers pretty cool.

120
00:09:38,783 --> 00:09:46,355
Rym: so he sent like a 60-foot snake in there and fucked up some terrifying shit that he found in there.

121
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:53,387
Rym: and Basically someone in our building just sucks and has clearly been putting things down there drain They shouldn't be and caused this problem.

122
00:09:53,889 --> 00:09:54,612
Rym: So he fixed it.

123
00:09:54,772 --> 00:09:55,836
Rym: The water is running fine.

124
00:09:56,218 --> 00:09:58,985
Rym: He leaves Late that night.

125
00:09:59,005 --> 00:10:00,856
Rym: the next night starts up again.

126
00:10:00,977 --> 00:10:01,580
Rym: same problem.

127
00:10:01,741 --> 00:10:06,300
Rym: Then they had to take our whole sink apart because they needed to use the longer snake.

128
00:10:06,561 --> 00:10:11,600
Rym: So they had to take apart like our sink the they had to take apart like they drilled a hole in our drain lines.

129
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,125
Scott: Why do they have to take apart the sink?

130
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:15,253
Scott: Can't they just go under the sink remove the.

131
00:10:15,394 --> 00:10:25,618
Rym: you know the thing and uh, I don't know if you do you know a lot about plumbing they had to remove the bit that is Inserted into the bottom of a sink that connects to the drain.

132
00:10:25,638 --> 00:10:29,009
Rym: that's actually like a separate bit in sinks like you screw it in.

133
00:10:29,832 --> 00:10:47,208
Rym: Anyway, he took all that apart because he had to get the snake in like the root of the pipes And he sent it even longer snake down and that fixed it again, and he was basically like yeah So if this ever happens again The problem is in the like basement infrastructure of the building and it's gonna be a big problem.

134
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:49,373
Rym: and then he left Hmm.

135
00:10:49,896 --> 00:10:51,689
Rym: So that was my fun couple of days.

136
00:10:53,091 --> 00:10:57,063
Scott: It sounds like they actually it doesn't sound like a neighbor actually fucked up twice.

137
00:10:57,124 --> 00:10:59,110
Scott: It sounds like the clog was pushed deeper.

138
00:10:59,411 --> 00:11:01,901
Scott: Yeah, push and then claw and then clogged again.

139
00:11:01,921 --> 00:11:04,110
Scott: and now that has been pushed even deeper.

140
00:11:04,692 --> 00:11:10,910
Scott: It's now in a larger pipe and has been gone, but it could happen again if someone shoved something bad again.

141
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:18,361
Rym: Yeah based on what was coming up out of the drain I think a lot of people just put coffee grounds down the drain like all of them.

142
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:20,106
Rym: I'm pretty sure that's a big part of it.

143
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,550
Scott: I Guess they could clog if they clump up, right?

144
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:30,170
Rym: Like if they do it if someone is also pouring grease and fat down the drain which you're not supposed to do in quantity.

145
00:11:30,752 --> 00:11:35,070
Rym: Coffee grounds plus fat in quantity will definitely cause that problem.

146
00:11:36,251 --> 00:11:45,810
Rym: Mm-hmm based on plumbing knowledge that I have and having seen this on the fat bird pictures I've seen in the yeah My dad did a lot of like house contracting on the side when we were kids to pay bills.

147
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,777
Rym: So, uh, I helped with some of that sometimes.

148
00:11:47,817 --> 00:11:51,430
Scott: and why don't you just buy like a giant snake on the internet?

149
00:11:51,691 --> 00:11:52,816
Rym: Yeah, where the hell am I gonna put that?

150
00:11:52,896 --> 00:11:55,549
Rym: also those are very expensive, especially the powered ones.

151
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,818
Scott: You'll make up for it getting in the plumbing business.

152
00:12:00,858 --> 00:12:01,781
Rym: Yeah, I could.

153
00:12:02,343 --> 00:12:05,506
Rym: I do not want to be in the plumbing business though smelly.

154
00:12:06,631 --> 00:12:08,279
Rym: Imagine if this clog had been in the.

155
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,470
Scott: you'd be you'd be it but you'd be a one-note plumber.

156
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,313
Scott: All you do is snake.

157
00:12:11,334 --> 00:12:11,976
Scott: You don't do anything.

158
00:12:11,996 --> 00:12:12,960
Scott: That's called roto-ruder.

159
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:14,065
Rym: You can just call roto-ruder.

160
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:15,290
Rym: Those guys don't get paid that much.

161
00:12:18,433 --> 00:12:19,508
Rym: So, yeah got some news.

162
00:12:21,751 --> 00:12:22,473
Scott: Do I have news?

163
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:23,918
Rym: I forget the NHL draft.

164
00:12:24,721 --> 00:12:25,143
Scott: Oh, yeah.

165
00:12:25,183 --> 00:12:25,424
Scott: Sure.

166
00:12:25,705 --> 00:12:27,190
Scott: Yeah, so the NHL draft happened.

167
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:33,389
Scott: It was obviously weird because under normal circumstances you would be just playing hockey by October 8th 7th, whatever day.

168
00:12:34,792 --> 00:12:42,238
Scott: You know as I think we discussed previously the Rangers won the twelve and a half percent lottery And had the first pick.

169
00:12:42,298 --> 00:12:44,049
Scott: they picked the best player.

170
00:12:45,414 --> 00:12:47,109
Scott: It's no surprise to anybody.

171
00:12:48,933 --> 00:12:56,215
Scott: It was interesting because you know, this is the first time they weren't able to hold it in a large Place everyone together.

172
00:12:56,316 --> 00:13:05,770
Scott: So, you know the different teams that to communicate with each other via, you know digital means The players had to celebrate in their homes, right?

173
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:10,210
Scott: Like, you know, they're just sitting there with a camera pointed at him so people can see their reaction or whatever.

174
00:13:10,992 --> 00:13:12,998
Scott: You know, it was a weird one.

175
00:13:13,018 --> 00:13:21,950
Rym: Yeah, I just I ended up just watching a Twitter feed Anna Fark thread that had like the updates plus your commentary and a few other people's commentary in the discords.

176
00:13:23,471 --> 00:13:27,403
Scott: Yeah, I think somebody called it like a. they had that they.

177
00:13:27,965 --> 00:13:28,647
Scott: what did they call it?

178
00:13:30,112 --> 00:13:31,609
Rym: And I've seen people call it the baby auction.

179
00:13:32,572 --> 00:13:35,510
Scott: Yeah, it was basically like a child.

180
00:13:35,671 --> 00:13:36,979
Scott: So this is something along those lines.

181
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:50,236
Rym: The only thing I cared about was the Rangers One that we won that had that winning lottery ticket from the draft lottery number one overall pick I'll take it not really deserve because the Rangers are actually a pretty good team During their rebuild.

182
00:13:50,276 --> 00:13:53,050
Scott: but listen, you got to prevent people from tanking, right?

183
00:13:53,251 --> 00:13:54,389
Scott: That is to you know.

184
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,156
Scott: And it worked out the lottery in the first place.

185
00:13:56,176 --> 00:14:00,171
Scott: the best-case scenario and elder instead is giving it to Detroit the worst team Right.

186
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:05,270
Rym: Yeah, like if we did it in the perfect world, yeah the Detroit and like Buffalo would have gotten like all the good kids.

187
00:14:06,171 --> 00:14:10,046
Scott: Yeah, especially in a year like this where you have one player who's just ridiculously good, right?

188
00:14:10,086 --> 00:14:14,082
Scott: It's like yeah Yeah, I'll see Loughren yay, whatever.

189
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:17,810
Rym: Yeah But we won that lottery had the winning lottery ticket.

190
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:24,763
Rym: So the only thing the Rangers did first is cash in that lottery ticket and get that kid and all they have to do Is not break him.

191
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:26,674
Rym: Just don't hurt that.

192
00:14:26,714 --> 00:14:30,849
Scott: I think the the most interesting thing was what the Commissioner said at the start.

193
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:32,695
Scott: They plan to.

194
00:14:33,477 --> 00:14:38,170
Scott: their current plan is to somehow start an NHL season on January 1st, and I'm like really?

195
00:14:39,076 --> 00:14:39,909
Scott: How are you gonna do that?

196
00:14:40,371 --> 00:14:51,890
Rym: I don't think there's gonna be a 2021 NHL season because the playoffs only worked because they made this Isolated bubble and only a few teams had to be there and as time went on fewer and fewer teams had to be there.

197
00:14:52,992 --> 00:15:00,770
Rym: They like like a really complicated schedule of like Right group teams together get a bunch of games in group a different set together like it'd be a weird schedule.

198
00:15:01,372 --> 00:15:05,890
Scott: So my prediction for the bubble was that they would start it and not finish it and I was wrong.

199
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:06,834
Scott: They've finished it.

200
00:15:07,216 --> 00:15:13,947
Scott: so my prediction now would be just what you said It's just not gonna happen, but I think we're gonna have to plus one.

201
00:15:14,008 --> 00:15:14,349
Scott: it right.

202
00:15:14,369 --> 00:15:19,249
Scott: so I think that now the adjusted prediction is this time they're gonna start and not finish.

203
00:15:19,389 --> 00:15:20,808
Rym: Yeah I think this one's much more.

204
00:15:21,491 --> 00:15:28,770
Rym: There are a lot more vectors of the season does not continue when it's every team as opposed to a few teams.

205
00:15:29,697 --> 00:15:31,149
Scott: Yeah, I don't know what's gonna be with that.

206
00:15:31,912 --> 00:15:33,596
Scott: You know, some people are really confident.

207
00:15:33,636 --> 00:15:34,318
Scott: someone was.

208
00:15:34,438 --> 00:15:38,810
Scott: I was like I tried to ask like hey, what's the ticket situation gonna be?

209
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,325
Scott: How about you just write it, right?

210
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:43,126
Scott: When is there gonna be a game I can actually go to?

211
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:50,961
Rym: Cuz yeah, cuz ever that my biggest fear is if they had if they if New York opens up to where there will be games But it's too early next year.

212
00:15:50,981 --> 00:15:53,572
Rym: I don't know if I trust going Right.

213
00:15:53,632 --> 00:15:57,630
Scott: It's like I'm very determined to be like listen the first game that they allow anyone to go to.

214
00:15:58,072 --> 00:16:00,790
Scott: I want to be there right because that would be a big-time deal, right?

215
00:16:00,913 --> 00:16:01,487
Scott: It's like, you know.

216
00:16:01,911 --> 00:16:08,406
Scott: But at the same time if they decide to be stupid and have a game and let people come when it's not safe to come I ain't gonna go.

217
00:16:09,971 --> 00:16:11,157
Scott: That's ridiculous.

218
00:16:11,177 --> 00:16:11,860
Scott: Why would I do that?

219
00:16:11,901 --> 00:16:12,845
Rym: Well, there's that I saw.

220
00:16:12,906 --> 00:16:13,750
Rym: there's a bunch of stuff.

221
00:16:13,911 --> 00:16:14,858
Rym: I was saying the same thing.

222
00:16:15,302 --> 00:16:26,460
Rym: people's behavior is In that situation across the board like if restaurants or like theaters or anything open is tied directly to whether or not they're Republican Or a Democrat in the United States and generally.

223
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:32,109
Scott: but like what if they take my money and like here's tickets And I'm like, I'd have to sell them I guess to someone who's willing to go.

224
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,233
Scott: But that feels good.

225
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:38,266
Rym: scalping tickets during kovat that is like selling the jib the the devil bottle.

226
00:16:39,128 --> 00:16:39,870
Scott: I'm not willing to.

227
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,954
Rym: Maybe It's basically.

228
00:16:46,015 --> 00:16:47,843
Rym: the story is very simply.

229
00:16:48,345 --> 00:16:49,270
Rym: you've got this bottle.

230
00:16:49,654 --> 00:16:55,747
Rym: It gives you fantastic powers But if you die while you still own it you go to hell in the bottle forever.

231
00:16:55,887 --> 00:16:56,529
Rym: There's no way out.

232
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:59,989
Rym: All right, you can only sell it for less than you paid for it.

233
00:17:01,992 --> 00:17:04,364
Rym: At some point someone's fucked by this bottle.

234
00:17:04,544 --> 00:17:11,310
Rym: if you sell it You have the plausible deniability of well the person I sold it to might sell it to someone else before they die.

235
00:17:11,911 --> 00:17:17,805
Rym: But at some point there is a smallest amount of currency at which time somebody goes to hell.

236
00:17:18,326 --> 00:17:19,669
Rym: how culpable somebody you.

237
00:17:20,713 --> 00:17:28,089
Scott: well, I think what would happen in this case is that unlike the devil bottle right is I would sell it for close to what it cost.

238
00:17:28,531 --> 00:17:40,766
Scott: You know the next person if they decide they don't want to take the risk they sell it for right and then eventually You know It's like everyone along the line is Recouping most of their money and somewhat towards the end of the line is like paying a penny and not use.

239
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:41,770
Scott: just not using the ticket.

240
00:17:42,111 --> 00:17:43,115
Scott: They're not going to hell.

241
00:17:43,135 --> 00:17:44,059
Scott: They're just basically.

242
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:45,665
Rym: I feel like someone will use the ticket though.

243
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:46,729
Rym: I feel like someone will go.

244
00:17:47,572 --> 00:17:48,134
Scott: Well, that's there.

245
00:17:48,315 --> 00:17:49,038
Scott: That's right.

246
00:17:49,138 --> 00:17:50,584
Rym: If we just don't get tickets at all.

247
00:17:50,825 --> 00:17:58,110
Rym: This tickets are still gonna get sold Though maybe they won't because that partisan thing the the study showed very clearly.

248
00:17:59,332 --> 00:18:05,710
Rym: People like Democrats like most people live in New York Won't go to things no matter what the law is if the law says restaurants are open.

249
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,802
Rym: Most people here will not actually go to them.

250
00:18:07,902 --> 00:18:14,443
Rym: some well, but most won't Yep, but in other states like people will go no matter what like.

251
00:18:14,463 --> 00:18:16,007
Rym: they'll even try to go if they're not allowed to.

252
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:18,810
Scott: We'll see what happened.

253
00:18:18,915 --> 00:18:19,188
Rym: Yep.

254
00:18:19,772 --> 00:18:21,276
Rym: Some other news from my home state.

255
00:18:21,677 --> 00:18:25,087
Rym: if you're not aware the state of Michigan is known for a few things.

256
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:27,690
Rym: their state animal is the Wolverine.

257
00:18:29,451 --> 00:18:33,830
Rym: Michigan is the only state outside of the Civil War to go to it to go to war with another states.

258
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:35,315
Rym: It had a war with Ohio.

259
00:18:35,355 --> 00:18:36,699
Rym: That was just stupid all around.

260
00:18:37,261 --> 00:18:39,870
Rym: It's the only state that ever tried to invade a foreign country.

261
00:18:40,554 --> 00:18:48,646
Rym: Michigan tried to invade Canada once because Michigan and The northern part of Michigan is filled with militia nutjobs.

262
00:18:48,707 --> 00:19:01,310
Rym: now in the rest of the country There are militia nutjobs, but the Michigan militias are way more dangerous Way heavier armed and way less subject to the scrutiny of the law for a lot of reasons.

263
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:03,818
Rym: Like they're dangerous to law enforcement.

264
00:19:03,838 --> 00:19:04,861
Rym: They're dangerous to everybody.

265
00:19:04,901 --> 00:19:05,222
Rym: They're just.

266
00:19:05,724 --> 00:19:06,105
Scott: it's really.

267
00:19:06,185 --> 00:19:07,790
Scott: it's a geographical thing, right?

268
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:08,998
Scott: It's like you look at Michigan.

269
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:17,878
Rym: You got this hand-shaped kind of thing Up in the top of the fingers that is like Right hills and mining and shit Right like way up towards.

270
00:19:17,918 --> 00:19:20,889
Scott: that goes like if you don't know Detroit is like in the bottom, right?

271
00:19:21,611 --> 00:19:22,614
Scott: It's it's way down.

272
00:19:22,715 --> 00:19:26,649
Rym: almost the entire economy and population of Michigan is in the southeast bottom little corner.

273
00:19:27,153 --> 00:19:29,028
Rym: The whole rest of it is just Hicks, right?

274
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:36,858
Scott: Yeah, you go to the top right in between Michigan Lake Michigan and Lake Huron right at that pointy part, you know and Parts south of that.

275
00:19:36,938 --> 00:19:38,490
Scott: It's pretty much just the middle of nowhere.

276
00:19:39,891 --> 00:19:40,914
Scott: You know, it's not really.

277
00:19:40,934 --> 00:19:44,344
Scott: you look at a Google satellite view and you'll see it's just green.

278
00:19:44,364 --> 00:19:46,210
Rym: Yeah, it's a huge state.

279
00:19:46,471 --> 00:19:49,844
Rym: But and there's that whole other bit that we in that war with Ohio.

280
00:19:49,884 --> 00:19:51,390
Rym: That's why we won that bit in the top.

281
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:55,072
Rym: They took it from Wisconsin gave it to us Right here.

282
00:19:55,092 --> 00:19:56,497
Scott: Let's let's zoom in on that area.

283
00:19:56,517 --> 00:19:58,204
Scott: See what kind of towns we can find.

284
00:19:58,224 --> 00:19:59,910
Scott: Here's a town called Petoskey.

285
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:00,474
Scott: Let's see.

286
00:20:00,514 --> 00:20:00,978
Rym: He's awesome.

287
00:20:01,018 --> 00:20:02,469
Rym: Actually Petoskey is a really fun place to go.

288
00:20:02,831 --> 00:20:16,308
Scott: It has a movie theater and a Home Depot and a Walmart and a Lowe's Petoskey Applebee's Mackinaw and a Buffalo Wild Wing Island Traverse City, basically everything along the coast is also cool.

289
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:20,785
Rym: It's when you get into that middle part or when you get into the middle part or okay.

290
00:20:20,805 --> 00:20:22,030
Scott: Yeah, Petoskey was on the water.

291
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:24,581
Scott: Let's pick one in the middle Lewiston Lewiston's in the middle.

292
00:20:24,601 --> 00:20:25,324
Scott: Let's see what they got.

293
00:20:25,344 --> 00:20:25,565
Scott: Yeah.

294
00:20:25,786 --> 00:20:26,670
Rym: Oh, hey, there's a wild ones.

295
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:34,404
Scott: Yeah a convenience store a supermarket a post office a hardware Doesn't even have any chains in it.

296
00:20:34,465 --> 00:20:40,550
Rym: Yeah Now look now church got zoom in will go up to that upper peninsula and just zoom in like somewhere in the middle of it.

297
00:20:42,034 --> 00:20:47,159
Rym: there's like in the Squares of roads and like mountains and copper mines.

298
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:49,866
Scott: I see Gwynn Gwynn UP.

299
00:20:49,926 --> 00:20:50,227
Scott: What are they?

300
00:20:50,347 --> 00:20:54,973
Scott: No new Swansea Larry's family.

301
00:20:55,013 --> 00:20:57,062
Rym: just funny the Petoskey is the first place you mentioned.

302
00:20:57,102 --> 00:20:58,690
Rym: Petoskey just happens to be super awesome.

303
00:20:59,455 --> 00:21:00,159
Scott: It was on the coast.

304
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,428
Scott: That's why it stood out here.

305
00:21:02,536 --> 00:21:04,569
Rym: But yeah, basically the Michigan militias a car wash.

306
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:10,109
Scott: There's a car wash a lot of reasons in a dollar store super dangerous and organized and big.

307
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:21,015
Rym: They one of them just legit like had a plan to kidnap the governor of the state and try to stage a coup Like an organized one they arrested.

308
00:21:21,176 --> 00:21:27,633
Scott: thing is even if you do successfully kidnap the governor of the state that does not create a coup Situation.

309
00:21:27,693 --> 00:21:32,610
Scott: well that cuz that's the thing the lieutenant governor would presumably take over or whatever Michigan has.

310
00:21:32,971 --> 00:21:38,747
Rym: Yeah, also, I feel like at the point where a militia has kidnapped the governor of a state.

311
00:21:38,767 --> 00:21:42,080
Rym: I Think the National Guard shows up.

312
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:44,190
Rym: I think like things escalate rapidly.

313
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:45,255
Scott: That's what I was gonna say.

314
00:21:45,275 --> 00:21:48,349
Scott: The lieutenant governor would just be like, hey, I ordered the National Guard to go.

315
00:21:48,631 --> 00:21:54,609
Rym: Okay, there's the other thing you gotta remember for a scene as these militias are the one thing they are not is intelligence.

316
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,750
Scott: So But well, I mean it's already showed that they're not intelligent.

317
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:02,810
Scott: They thought that kidnapping the governor makes you the governor or something.

318
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:12,476
Rym: Yeah but they seem to have been emboldened because of Trump talking about how Michigan needs to be liberated from its Democratic government and It's like that instigated them.

319
00:22:12,657 --> 00:22:13,742
Rym: That's one point.

320
00:22:14,003 --> 00:22:27,149
Rym: and all this shit show of 2020 but - they're a pretty big militia and I think 13 of their leaders are currently like arrested and The FBI has already said like yeah, this whole organization is going down like here we come.

321
00:22:28,033 --> 00:22:28,193
Rym: it's.

322
00:22:28,394 --> 00:22:36,890
Rym: uh, it's a crazy story and my news is that In any other year, this would have been like the headline for weeks.

323
00:22:37,951 --> 00:22:39,917
Rym: This is barely being covered.

324
00:22:39,937 --> 00:22:54,149
Scott: I don't know if it'd be the headline for weeks because the things like it actually happens pretty often because on this scale It happens pretty often where the law enforcement discovers something horrible and stops it in advance, right?

325
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:57,795
Scott: Yeah There have been several terrorist incidents.

326
00:22:57,815 --> 00:23:09,286
Scott: would that have been stopped in advance and not just the ones where they trick someone into like where the FBI was the one selling someone bombs right more like here's yeah Here's a terror cell of three people that's real that we found and we stopped them.

327
00:23:09,307 --> 00:23:09,970
Rym: We found their bomb.

328
00:23:10,793 --> 00:23:15,310
Scott: Yeah, it actually it happens right but those stories tend not to be big news.

329
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:19,806
Scott: The only time they're big news is if the person actually attempts their thing, right?

330
00:23:19,826 --> 00:23:24,006
Scott: So like, you know Fertilizer bomber guy in Times Square, right?

331
00:23:24,046 --> 00:23:26,154
Scott: It's like yeah He just pretty much failed.

332
00:23:26,235 --> 00:23:31,409
Scott: but it's like he attempted his thing and then got caught and therefore is a much bigger news story.

333
00:23:31,469 --> 00:23:33,416
Scott: if they Had just found that guy a day earlier.

334
00:23:33,437 --> 00:23:44,029
Rym: You wouldn't you might not even know about it, you know, so Yeah, but in this case it did that like if you read the whole thing This was a way more organized and serious plot than his typical.

335
00:23:44,069 --> 00:23:46,310
Scott: Oh, yeah It was definitely a big a big-time plot.

336
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:49,963
Scott: But I'm just saying is that the the bigness of the news is due to the.

337
00:23:50,103 --> 00:23:50,244
Scott: the.

338
00:23:50,464 --> 00:23:53,439
Scott: the non bigness of the news is due To the being caught in advance.

339
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:58,745
Rym: I Don't think it's just that because this is bigger than any motion you can militia thing.

340
00:23:58,766 --> 00:24:02,103
Rym: that's happened in a long time And I think it's man gets man.

341
00:24:04,071 --> 00:24:07,709
Scott: Man gets stopped from biting dog is not as big a story as man bites dog.

342
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:14,453
Rym: Yeah, I don't know no matter how big the man or how crazy the dog you should They.

343
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:20,070
Rym: their plan was actually pretty comprehensive coming down to blowing up a bunch of bridges that they were like.

344
00:24:20,695 --> 00:24:23,935
Rym: This was like a full-on Paramilitary operation.

345
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:24,617
Scott: Yes.

346
00:24:24,677 --> 00:24:29,954
Scott: It doesn't matter that no matter how big the dog or how scary the man Man gets.

347
00:24:29,994 --> 00:24:32,686
Scott: stopped from biting dog is not as big a news story now.

348
00:24:32,706 --> 00:24:33,450
Rym: We're in a news cycle.

349
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,998
Rym: We're like the fly that was showing us.

350
00:24:36,038 --> 00:24:39,849
Rym: Mike Pence's true nature is like the big news and already that's being forgotten.

351
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,048
Scott: No, I mean, that's a that's a. they live situation.

352
00:24:43,088 --> 00:24:47,610
Rym: Yeah I was actually watching that stupid debate because Kamala did a great job.

353
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:52,710
Rym: But the funniest thing was I'm watching it and then the fly appears and I literally stand up like what the fuck how to fly.

354
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:56,765
Rym: Get in here and I go over to like hit the TV and I'm like, oh, oh shit.

355
00:24:57,186 --> 00:24:58,110
Rym: It's actually on him.

356
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:58,773
Scott: Why didn't?

357
00:24:58,833 --> 00:24:59,818
Scott: why didn't he swat it?

358
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,707
Scott: Uh, that's what I don't understand.

359
00:25:01,727 --> 00:25:04,762
Rym: I He might just be even like.

360
00:25:04,822 --> 00:25:05,608
Rym: I don't know that is.

361
00:25:06,791 --> 00:25:07,132
Rym: That is.

362
00:25:07,293 --> 00:25:18,226
Rym: it is weird that he did not notice that because I noticed if a net comes within like a foot of my face I know right like like if we're in a panel and like a fly comes anywhere near the stage.

363
00:25:18,246 --> 00:25:23,989
Rym: We're both like what the fuck fly anyway.

364
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,574
Rym: things Of the day.

365
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:30,130
Scott: when I was a kid my parents took us on a lot of you know vacations, right?

366
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,736
Scott: But you know, they weren't necessarily.

367
00:25:31,998 --> 00:25:34,227
Scott: they weren't the tiniest vacations, right?

368
00:25:34,247 --> 00:25:40,210
Scott: We weren't Unfortunate and poor we didn't like not go anywhere, but they also weren't the extravagant vacations.

369
00:25:40,371 --> 00:25:43,382
Scott: I know a lot of people went on who had mad moneys, right?

370
00:25:43,664 --> 00:25:56,089
Scott: Yeah, you know, so One of the places we went was the Catskill game farm Which is a place in the Catskills of New York, and it was basically like a mega petting zoo, right?

371
00:25:56,410 --> 00:26:04,821
Scott: It's like they had all kinds of animals going on in there like giraffes even right You know, I don't know this was way back.

372
00:26:04,861 --> 00:26:15,090
Scott: I don't know how well the animals were treated You don't know Right, but this is a place that like had everything from you know sheep up to giraffe, right?

373
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:16,956
Scott: And you would go there you'd pay admission.

374
00:26:16,996 --> 00:26:17,919
Scott: It wasn't like a zoo.

375
00:26:18,521 --> 00:26:23,224
Scott: It was like a petting zoo like very interactive You know, they called it a game farm, right?

376
00:26:23,244 --> 00:26:23,948
Scott: They didn't call it a zoo.

377
00:26:25,591 --> 00:26:29,729
Scott: I don't think they had a lot of you know, wasn't an educational place necessarily.

378
00:26:32,651 --> 00:26:37,490
Scott: But anyway, apparently I had you know, we joke about it because we know my cousin.

379
00:26:38,154 --> 00:26:40,970
Scott: There was some incidents there where she was very afraid of all the animals.

380
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:45,886
Scott: You know the place had memories from my family right where it were created there.

381
00:26:45,927 --> 00:26:47,946
Scott: We only went there once though anyway.

382
00:26:49,051 --> 00:26:52,410
Scott: So apparently I you know, I hadn't thought about the place in forever.

383
00:26:52,571 --> 00:26:55,569
Scott: So I didn't realize that it was sold some years ago.

384
00:26:56,172 --> 00:27:03,817
Scott: And when it was sold, you know people tried to rescue as many animals as they could and you know to keep them from getting You know sent to some who knows where.

385
00:27:03,977 --> 00:27:05,905
Rym: that's literally what my mom's job used to be.

386
00:27:05,925 --> 00:27:16,110
Scott: Yeah But yeah, it was sold to some people and those for a very low price and those people attempted to Basically convert it to like an inn, right?

387
00:27:16,971 --> 00:27:22,110
Scott: You know, it's like you would go and stay there and like a fancy kind of in bed-and-breakfast kind of place.

388
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:24,679
Scott: You know, they renovated some of the buildings on the property.

389
00:27:24,719 --> 00:27:25,522
Scott: It's a large property.

390
00:27:25,542 --> 00:27:26,626
Rym: Yeah, the photos look nice.

391
00:27:26,706 --> 00:27:27,850
Rym: It looks like renovated.

392
00:27:28,653 --> 00:27:30,510
Scott: Yeah, they definitely successfully renovated it.

393
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:31,273
Rym: you know what it looks like.

394
00:27:31,313 --> 00:27:37,669
Rym: look at these bedrooms rustic chic as in it looks rustic on purpose as opposed to Rustic because it's worn down and rustic.

395
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:41,110
Scott: Yeah, so they all the animals are gone.

396
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:53,580
Scott: They've been gone for years, but people renovated it and I noticed just by chance because we were discussing real estate I did a search on like Zillow and I just saw it pop up as like the most expensive property in the Catskills.

397
00:27:54,023 --> 00:27:56,854
Scott: at two million dollars It was for sale.

398
00:27:56,954 --> 00:28:03,489
Scott: So it seems that I guess because of the kovat situation or just because of bad business No one's staying at this in.

399
00:28:05,461 --> 00:28:08,020
Scott: So They lost their investment and they're trying to recoup it.

400
00:28:10,011 --> 00:28:13,305
Scott: So I was like, hey listen, you know, I understand you lost your.

401
00:28:13,445 --> 00:28:16,982
Scott: you made a bad investment But you just sort of you just have to take a loss on that.

402
00:28:17,003 --> 00:28:18,430
Scott: You're not gonna be able to make back your money.

403
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:19,975
Scott: No one's paying two million dollars for that.

404
00:28:20,256 --> 00:28:24,830
Rym: I mean two million dollars could almost buy a two-bedroom apartment in my neighborhood.

405
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:29,201
Scott: it's like But apparently there's a pending offer.

406
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:30,670
Scott: I don't know how big the offer is.

407
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:36,570
Scott: I don't know if it's two million dollars or not, but somebody's offered to buy it according to the internet, which is fascinating.

408
00:28:37,611 --> 00:28:43,349
Scott: so I wonder if the people who tried to do the renovation are gonna just take a loss how big a loss they're gonna take.

409
00:28:43,449 --> 00:28:47,743
Scott: but It's interesting just to see this, you know, sort of like.

410
00:28:47,763 --> 00:28:49,210
Scott: it's sort of like the action park, right?

411
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:53,062
Scott: It's like usually we see these abandoned amusement park type places.

412
00:28:53,122 --> 00:28:54,226
Scott: Just be abandoned.

413
00:28:54,426 --> 00:28:54,587
Scott: Yeah,

414
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:55,630
Rym: please slowly decline

415
00:28:56,772 --> 00:29:11,864
Scott: Right, it's like you look at like the splendid China in Orlando, which is a place We also went which is owned by the China or was owned by the Chinese government might still be I don't know but they set up a propaganda ish amusement park in in Orlando right to.

416
00:29:11,945 --> 00:29:17,246
Scott: that celebrates China Has like fake terracotta warriors and that sort of thing, right?

417
00:29:17,266 --> 00:29:21,470
Scott: We went there And that place I'm pretty sure is still just abandoned.

418
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:30,490
Scott: I don't know who owns it But it's weird to see one Abandoned be owned and tried to actually be used or done something with especially at a time like this.

419
00:29:31,471 --> 00:29:34,024
Rym: Fuck is a three-quarter bathroom as opposed to a full.

420
00:29:34,065 --> 00:29:35,150
Rym: I know a full and a half bath.

421
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,775
Rym: I've no idea what a three-quarter bath is.

422
00:29:36,795 --> 00:29:48,950
Scott: I don't know if you google it and find out I am right now, but but yeah Has a shower but no tub, okay Okay, but yeah go and check out the Zillow posting for the castle game farm.

423
00:29:49,111 --> 00:29:52,310
Scott: You can also google it on the internet and read about the history of the castle.

424
00:29:54,052 --> 00:30:01,883
Scott: It's an interesting kind of place that I think people who aren't from New York Or aren't older don't even know exists and don't even think about.

425
00:30:01,963 --> 00:30:14,219
Rym: but there are a lot of things that are within like a day trip of New York that exists primarily to serve kids who live in the New York area and like go upstate to Experience nature and such.

426
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:23,410
Scott: well, there's a lot of things in the Catskills Specifically, especially in the era before you know cheaper commercial more widely available commercial flight.

427
00:30:23,852 --> 00:30:31,990
Scott: The many people who lived in New York and you know this New York area Needed to go on vacations and there are many leisurely destinations.

428
00:30:32,512 --> 00:30:42,229
Scott: Same reason Atlantic City existed like people couldn't just fly to Vegas for a long time Especially in the Catskills this place like Lake Compounce in Connecticut, which I think is still open.

429
00:30:43,412 --> 00:30:54,110
Scott: That were like these leisurely vacation resort type places and especially in the Catskills The culture of going there is completely gone and a lot of those places are abandoned closed out of business.

430
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:55,718
Rym: Goodbye, there are the region like.

431
00:30:55,738 --> 00:30:56,764
Rym: there are places like that.

432
00:30:56,804 --> 00:30:57,990
Scott: They are very fascinating.

433
00:30:58,131 --> 00:31:01,650
Rym: There are places like that everywhere like Cedar Point was one of those places.

434
00:31:02,092 --> 00:31:09,910
Rym: The only reason it survived is that it became a roller coaster park in the era When people could actually just fly to Florida instead of going to Lake Erie.

435
00:31:10,811 --> 00:31:12,455
Scott: Right, it's like if you weren't worse.

436
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:17,910
Scott: there were places that were leisurely destinations that were worth going to because they were within range.

437
00:31:18,291 --> 00:31:18,532
Scott: Right.

438
00:31:18,673 --> 00:31:24,739
Scott: Yeah, but as soon as if you're not the best thing in range Well, people can just fly to a better thing.

439
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:30,717
Scott: So you have to be like the best thing, you know, that's like I wouldn't have gone to Cedar Point.

440
00:31:30,737 --> 00:31:31,580
Rym: We couldn't afford that.

441
00:31:31,641 --> 00:31:33,869
Rym: We would have gone to whatever like Six Flags was near us.

442
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:34,893
Rym: We just it's like.

443
00:31:34,913 --> 00:31:57,028
Scott: you have to either be worth flying to like Disney World people come from all over Or you have to be good enough that someone who can fly Right is who or is decided not to fly or can't afford to fly will choose you Right, and there's not too many people left because so many people are flying so not too many of those things can exist locally.

444
00:31:57,109 --> 00:32:00,525
Scott: Yep So but yeah, the abandoned ones are fascinating.

445
00:32:00,866 --> 00:32:05,390
Rym: So my thing of the day I got to back up a little bit to the concept of BMX bikes.

446
00:32:06,568 --> 00:32:10,728
Rym: Uh BMX biking wasn't really a thing until the early 80s like late 70s.

447
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:12,930
Scott: Oh the early that is that is true.

448
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:17,567
Scott: In fact my town in the in the 90s had a BMX track at one of the parks.

449
00:32:17,608 --> 00:32:18,210
Scott: It might still be.

450
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:19,295
Rym: Oh, yeah, we had one too.

451
00:32:19,355 --> 00:32:22,890
Rym: I had a BMX bike and I went there and there were certain kids.

452
00:32:23,031 --> 00:32:25,621
Scott: I didn't I wasn't one of those kids but I knew some kids were.

453
00:32:25,661 --> 00:32:27,026
Scott: it's like they were on they like.

454
00:32:27,147 --> 00:32:29,034
Scott: they went there and Competed officially.

455
00:32:29,054 --> 00:32:31,302
Scott: It was almost like a little league level competitive.

456
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:33,410
Rym: Oh, yeah, my middle school had a BMX team.

457
00:32:33,611 --> 00:32:36,763
Rym: It was the school supported it, but it was like a little one.

458
00:32:36,883 --> 00:32:38,490
Scott: It didn't have anything to do with the school.

459
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:39,034
Scott: It was.

460
00:32:39,115 --> 00:32:40,910
Scott: I don't know who ran it, but it was ours.

461
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:41,432
Rym: We did.

462
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:46,190
Rym: it was a third-party thing, but the school like endorsed it and kids from the school would go to it.

463
00:32:47,972 --> 00:32:48,862
Scott: But here was.

464
00:32:48,882 --> 00:32:51,093
Scott: I Found it on.

465
00:32:51,896 --> 00:32:53,442
Scott: I found it on Google.

466
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,047
Scott: Yep, Trumbull BMX track.

467
00:32:55,087 --> 00:32:55,449
Scott: I found it.

468
00:32:55,489 --> 00:33:07,010
Rym: There it is but I feel like it's interesting because Before like our generation like me and Scott born in the early 80s We grew up during the literal beginning and peak of BMX biking.

469
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:12,710
Rym: So today most kids get like a tricycle and then they basically get like a mountain bike or a cruiser next.

470
00:33:13,514 --> 00:33:23,390
Rym: When we were kid and before that it was similar when we were kids Every kid got a BMX bike before they got a bigger bike like BMX bike was the step above trike for most kids.

471
00:33:23,951 --> 00:33:29,486
Scott: Because yeah, I think before before mountain because mountain bikes are actually a relatively recent invention.

472
00:33:29,646 --> 00:33:31,050
Rym: Yeah, they were like before.

473
00:33:31,552 --> 00:33:35,130
Rym: Before that were like hacked together monstrosities that didn't like a custom.

474
00:33:36,052 --> 00:33:43,529
Scott: It's like before the Toys R Us racks are filled with mountain bikes They were filled with BMX bikes basic and before that they were filled with Cruiser bikes.

475
00:33:44,477 --> 00:33:45,667
Scott: Yeah, so yeah.

476
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:54,190
Scott: But the BMX biking that you know that style was basically, you know more like a motocross, but you pedal.

477
00:33:54,391 --> 00:33:58,010
Rym: Yeah, it literally just stands for it's a bicycle motocross.

478
00:33:58,793 --> 00:34:03,733
Scott: Yes, it's just a dirt track with a bunch of hills excite bikes around Like that.

479
00:34:03,774 --> 00:34:08,406
Scott: you race around by pedaling you do jumps that sort of thing and that was like.

480
00:34:08,627 --> 00:34:16,061
Rym: but the problem was it's not bad because the thing about BMX biking was that most kids did not actually BMX bike on BMX courses.

481
00:34:16,443 --> 00:34:22,003
Rym: they got BMX bikes But then they ride them around the neighborhood and BMX bikes actually really suck at that.

482
00:34:22,525 --> 00:34:23,628
Rym: but that like they sure do.

483
00:34:23,688 --> 00:34:33,152
Rym: Yep so my thing of the day is This archive of the totally rad fad of 80s BMX and this is like All the.

484
00:34:33,212 --> 00:34:34,574
Scott: it was a totally rad fad.

485
00:34:34,835 --> 00:34:35,016
Scott: just

486
00:34:35,076 --> 00:34:46,351
Rym: the style the advertising the counterculture the culture like the Advertisements that got kids into it the celebrities from it the aesthetics of it the everything It's just all

487
00:34:46,371 --> 00:34:53,739
Scott: definitely has a particular aesthetic of like a checkered flag and like yeah, that's like super That's kind of it's cut, you know.

488
00:34:53,760 --> 00:35:01,470
Scott: at the time it was a little bit cheesy But now it's kind of retro cheesy cool or like really like badly clashing colors like the color scheme of BM.

489
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:02,253
Rym: Oh, yeah, right.

490
00:35:02,313 --> 00:35:04,501
Scott: It's all about bright colors like neon

491
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:06,750
Rym: zinc NASCAR, but on a shitty looking bike

492
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:08,794
Scott: Exactly, but he

493
00:35:08,834 --> 00:35:23,927
Rym: was huge like as a kid like we had like I had some BMX like racer trading cards like the capitalist system was really trying to sell kids on how cool BMX was and it worked on us for a long time and This webpage just shows that.

494
00:35:23,987 --> 00:35:29,610
Rym: is that Somewhat adjacent to monster truck as well, which I was also very into as a kid.

495
00:35:30,032 --> 00:35:35,222
Rym: I thought that was a career I could have be a monster truck driver, which technically I guess good That is a career you could have.

496
00:35:35,323 --> 00:35:37,292
Rym: I think it pays that much Huh?

497
00:35:37,674 --> 00:35:39,686
Scott: I don't know how much it pays but it's a career you can have.

498
00:35:39,706 --> 00:35:41,896
Rym: also a fun fact I went to many monster truck shows.

499
00:35:42,578 --> 00:35:43,703
Rym: I never went to.

500
00:35:43,843 --> 00:35:44,686
Scott: I went to zero.

501
00:35:44,746 --> 00:35:45,670
Scott: I only saw the commercial.

502
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,557
Rym: I went to so many going.

503
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,910
Rym: I even went to like low tier like semi amateur ones.

504
00:35:51,592 --> 00:35:54,622
Rym: But I also went to a lot of demolition derbies as a kid.

505
00:35:54,642 --> 00:35:55,264
Rym: I grew up in Michigan.

506
00:35:55,284 --> 00:35:55,725
Rym: What do you want?

507
00:35:55,745 --> 00:36:02,181
Rym: Yeah, but I Never once saw grave digger actually complete a course.

508
00:36:02,562 --> 00:36:08,150
Rym: every time grave digger was there it either broke down Before the race or broke down in the race.

509
00:36:08,391 --> 00:36:09,777
Rym: I never saw it finish a race.

510
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:15,216
Rym: even once my entire life even though it was my favorite car Wasn't Bigfoot like the big one.

511
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:19,850
Rym: Yeah Bigfoot was like the Hulk Hogan and that's what everyone liked great.

512
00:36:19,951 --> 00:36:21,786
Scott: So grave digger was like the undertaker dig.

513
00:36:21,806 --> 00:36:23,496
Rym: Yeah, great Literally grave jigger was.

514
00:36:23,757 --> 00:36:30,168
Rym: the people who liked the undertaker tended to like grave digger The same way that kids today was like, I don't know Reaper from overwatch.

515
00:36:31,279 --> 00:36:31,886
Rym: I was that kid.

516
00:36:32,531 --> 00:36:37,325
Rym: Everyone's got their Bigfoot shirt and I'm the kid with like the grave digger shirt.

517
00:36:37,385 --> 00:36:39,010
Rym: like ah, I like the cool car.

518
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:48,890
Rym: Anyway in the meta moment the GeekNights book club book, we're not reading the tale again because we're not reading anything nothing at all.

519
00:36:49,793 --> 00:36:52,303
Rym: I have not read fiction in like two months.

520
00:36:52,404 --> 00:36:53,970
Rym: I'm just reading nonfiction.

521
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:58,142
Rym: only to uh Have I read any fiction?

522
00:36:58,202 --> 00:36:59,009
Rym: cuz I read some comics.

Scott: I've read comics.

524
00:37:01,254 --> 00:37:05,170
Scott: I've been reading some comics but in terms Rose when is the last prose fiction?

525
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:07,319

526
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:07,519
Scott: Yep.

527
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:08,584

Rym: In fact, you know what I last read.

529
00:37:10,411 --> 00:37:20,784
Rym: I read a whole chapter of the Tale of Genji on the way back from PAX East Which was literally the start of quarantine and that was the last time.

530
00:37:20,824 --> 00:37:22,450
Scott: I may have read some around then as well.

531
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:25,685
Rym: Yeah, anyway, I was on the Amtrak the Acela and I've read that that was it.

532
00:37:25,705 --> 00:37:26,810
Rym: That was the last time I read.

533
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:29,398
Rym: So, uh, yeah, we'll read it at some point.

534
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,401
Rym: stay tuned.

535
00:37:30,422 --> 00:37:31,004
Rym: blame COVID.

536
00:37:31,526 --> 00:37:32,730
Rym: We just did another panel.

537
00:37:33,152 --> 00:37:45,196
Rym: I'm gonna try to get the video of a director's cut of the panel We did at PAX online up on our YouTube channel this weekend, maybe like Tuesday or Wednesday at the latest But I don't know otherwise.

538
00:37:45,758 --> 00:37:46,963
Rym: we got no conventions coming up.

539
00:37:47,304 --> 00:37:48,690
Rym: we're getting into the cold dark times.

540
00:37:49,091 --> 00:37:52,624
Rym: We're getting into the times where normally we have a bunch of travel and vacations.

541
00:37:52,905 --> 00:37:56,169
Rym: GeekNights gets interrupted a bunch But I ain't going anywhere.

542
00:37:57,262 --> 00:37:59,596
Scott: Nope You know, I don't want to shit talk.

543
00:37:59,616 --> 00:38:00,259
Scott: So I'm not gonna.

544
00:38:00,681 --> 00:38:09,095
Scott: but I will say that you know I was under the impression that my work was going to increase the number of vacation days We could hold over to next year.

545
00:38:09,175 --> 00:38:09,617
Scott: who they?

546
00:38:09,657 --> 00:38:11,866
Rym: but they lied but did not confirm right?

547
00:38:12,468 --> 00:38:13,960
Scott: Right, right They basically said they.

548
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:23,689
Scott: well they said pretty much You know, hold on we're gonna be making it in some Messaging about that around the block too many times to trust that.

549
00:38:24,671 --> 00:38:33,761
Scott: right, so, you know, they basically said well, we'll say something about that soon, but like my My product manager recently that's my said that he was.

550
00:38:34,483 --> 00:38:37,954
Scott: he was pressured to use PTO Which he hadn't used all year.

551
00:38:37,974 --> 00:38:39,620
Scott: So he's taking off next week.

552
00:38:40,141 --> 00:38:42,690
Scott: So this is making me think they're there, you know.

553
00:38:43,431 --> 00:38:47,910
Rym: Hopefully we had like a lot of days like way too many saved up, right?

554
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:53,290
Scott: Well, the point is I might end up not working most of December, right?

555
00:38:53,410 --> 00:39:04,268
Scott: So I can't shit talk and say yeah, if I don't work most of December, I'm gonna do some stuff But if I don't work for most of December, it is likely I'll do something.

556
00:39:04,288 --> 00:39:10,609
Scott: Yep I hope I mean I might not but I would feel guilty if I didn't make even one thing.

557
00:39:10,669 --> 00:39:15,548
Rym: Oh my god I'm still like kovat messes up my sense of time like this quarantine to be in the house.

558
00:39:15,628 --> 00:39:20,710
Rym: Like I Feel like every time I'm relaxing like even though I'm just playing Star Wars.

559
00:39:20,851 --> 00:39:25,910
Rym: I'm thinking I should really be like making a panel editing some stuff like putting more GeekNights.

560
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,476
Scott: I made a panel during.

561
00:39:27,737 --> 00:39:28,500
Scott: I already did my coat.

562
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,824
Rym: We did a bunch of panels already.

563
00:39:30,226 --> 00:39:31,310
Scott: You're you're gonna upload.

564
00:39:31,672 --> 00:39:32,336
Rym: Yeah, but I want.

565
00:39:32,357 --> 00:39:34,490
Rym: but I had a bunch of solo panels I wanted to do.

566
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,749
Rym: I want to start the utenna thing, but I don't have time.

567
00:39:38,894 --> 00:39:39,827
Rym: Well, you'll have some time.

568
00:39:40,531 --> 00:39:41,470
Rym: We'll see if you do anything.

569
00:39:42,471 --> 00:39:44,100
Scott: So if I have time, yeah, we'll see.

570
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,950
Rym: I don't have time so it can't be joint projects.

571
00:39:46,071 --> 00:39:50,590
Rym: I have no more free time than I normally would Mmm, so yeah, let's get right into it.

572
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:59,229
Rym: It's a spooky times time to watch spooky stuff and we got together with a bunch of our friends and we watch Vampires versus the Brock's.

573
00:39:59,531 --> 00:40:05,265
Rym: We'll get to spoilers at the end because I want to talk about like the things that happen in this movie But to review it first don't worry.

574
00:40:05,285 --> 00:40:09,760
Scott: No spoilers Yeah, so this is a movie that is Netflix exclusive.

575
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:10,683
Scott: I think Netflix made it.

576
00:40:10,863 --> 00:40:11,024
Scott: Yep.

577
00:40:11,565 --> 00:40:11,967
Scott: It's a pretty.

578
00:40:12,047 --> 00:40:12,950
Scott: it's a pretty short movie.

579
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:19,625
Rym: I think I don't think it's that long like it looks like they started on it in 2018 but then they cut a deal with Netflix to like get it fully made and like that's.

580
00:40:19,845 --> 00:40:24,030
Rym: you could read the story and Basically, it's a story pretty straightforward.

581
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:29,847
Scott: Where there are vampires in the Bronx, that's not a spoiler.

582
00:40:29,867 --> 00:40:35,995
Scott: It's in the title And it's in the.

583
00:40:36,055 --> 00:40:36,978
Scott: it's in the summary.

584
00:40:37,138 --> 00:40:40,970
Scott: right the vampires are also committing gentrification.

585
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:49,717
Scott: they're buying up properties and Converting them from say, you know a bodega into you know a bone and thread.

586
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:50,601
Scott: is it?

587
00:40:51,464 --> 00:40:52,910
Scott: is it a food place or is it a?

588
00:40:53,831 --> 00:40:57,863
Rym: The worst part is one of the fake gentrification things was that butter store.

589
00:40:58,305 --> 00:41:05,685
Rym: and while my brain said Simultaneously that is some gentrifying bullshit a part of my brain said I would shop there.

590
00:41:06,347 --> 00:41:10,545
Scott: I would go buy fancy butter I would buy fancy butter and make cookies out of it.

591
00:41:10,566 --> 00:41:12,110
Scott: Yeah anyway.

592
00:41:14,194 --> 00:41:15,970
Scott: So it's a. it's a you know, it's a pretty.

593
00:41:18,765 --> 00:41:23,856
Scott: It's Not like a super complex movie is a straightforward Vampire movie.

594
00:41:24,278 --> 00:41:31,670
Scott: In fact, I will say it is I would say it's at the level of like a made-for-tv movie the kind of thing you'd see on like wonderful world of Disney.

595
00:41:32,172 --> 00:41:34,038
Rym: I'd say it's a full step above that.

596
00:41:34,059 --> 00:41:37,190
Rym: It is actually at the level of quality of the Lost Boys.

597
00:41:38,192 --> 00:41:45,544
Scott: Well, I mean I would say right on time out Like The acting is better than one of those TV movies for certain.

598
00:41:45,564 --> 00:41:47,030
Rym: Yeah, but you're right in terms of the plot.

599
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:48,294
Rym: It is fairly straightforward.

600
00:41:48,334 --> 00:41:49,698
Rym: The few twists are right.

601
00:41:49,818 --> 00:41:51,543
Rym: good, but they're not like.

602
00:41:51,564 --> 00:41:55,288
Rym: there's not Citizen Kane twists Yeah, not even close, right?

603
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:58,817
Rym: But the Lost Boys 2 is a very straightforward plot.

604
00:41:59,118 --> 00:42:04,724
Rym: kid move kid is in town finds vampires vampire shit happens vampire confrontation happens.

605
00:42:04,825 --> 00:42:05,349
Rym: end of movie.

606
00:42:06,431 --> 00:42:07,555
Scott: Yeah, pretty much right it's.

607
00:42:07,976 --> 00:42:10,705
Scott: it's a movie about some kids, you know, they live in the Bronx.

608
00:42:10,825 --> 00:42:17,050
Scott: they discover these problems You know, they fight their problems with the help of the community right the community bands together.

609
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:30,506
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty much exactly what you expect really straightforward But with that simple formula that doesn't really have you know Too much clever or new or interesting about the formula wise right.

610
00:42:31,068 --> 00:42:33,735
Scott: the execution It's like wow, you know you did.

611
00:42:33,956 --> 00:42:39,370
Scott: you took that cookie cutter, right and you just like cut out the best damn cookie, right?

612
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:40,654
Scott: It's like the cookie.

613
00:42:41,155 --> 00:42:43,844
Scott: It's like you cut the edges of the cookie cutter.

614
00:42:44,045 --> 00:42:47,396
Scott: Perfect the thickness of the cookie Perfectly uniform right.

615
00:42:47,436 --> 00:42:53,149
Scott: the dough and the flavor of the cookie as good as it could be in a plain old butter cookie Which is still damn tasty.

616
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:59,010
Rym: I want to eat that like the characters and like their chatter with each other like are just great.

617
00:42:59,131 --> 00:43:01,229
Rym: Like the characters are really compelling really fun.

618
00:43:01,611 --> 00:43:06,323
Rym: They're deep enough without like everyone having a long origin story nonsense.

619
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:08,770
Rym: Like it just hits all the right beats.

620
00:43:10,331 --> 00:43:11,659
Scott: They missed on a few things.

621
00:43:11,699 --> 00:43:13,810
Scott: There were some characters that could have had more screen time.

622
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:14,975
Scott: Maybe some that had too much.

623
00:43:15,256 --> 00:43:18,270
Rym: one of them should have had one bust out moment and killed a vampire.

624
00:43:19,131 --> 00:43:19,894
Scott: Yeah, but they didn't.

625
00:43:19,914 --> 00:43:23,869
Rym: I was hoping the priest would do more but the priest was funny enough.

626
00:43:26,628 --> 00:43:35,538
Rym: I Did hope he did more also I hope do you I hope he would show up and be the dad or the grandpa from Lost Boys That like I expected that to happen.

627
00:43:35,799 --> 00:43:36,963
Rym: That was the only thing.

628
00:43:36,983 --> 00:43:38,568
Rym: I expect this movie to do that.

629
00:43:38,608 --> 00:43:39,110
Rym: It did not do.

630
00:43:40,121 --> 00:43:45,246
Scott: Yep The movie is extremely New York II and extremely Bronx II, right?

631
00:43:45,266 --> 00:43:53,221
Scott: So if you're not From the New York or spend a lot of time in New York or from the Bronx You might learn some stuff about New York and the Bronx like

632
00:43:53,261 --> 00:43:58,429
Rym: all those things like the kids hanging out in the bodega Like randomly in the back room like yeah, that's New York like that.

633
00:43:58,590 --> 00:44:02,364
Scott: That's like there's a lot of genuine New York stuff in this movie.

634
00:44:02,405 --> 00:44:06,384
Scott: That is like absolutely, you know No one's looking at that and saying that's not New York.

635
00:44:06,424 --> 00:44:07,229
Scott: Like no that that's.

636
00:44:07,249 --> 00:44:08,453
Scott: yeah This is what I know.

637
00:44:08,473 --> 00:44:17,590
Rym: Ghostbusters is very Manhattan like super like set in Manhattan Capital M. this movie is that for the Bronx, right?

638
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:22,470
Scott: But I think that Ghostbusters if you know nothing about New York, you don't really lose anything.

639
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:25,550
Rym: Yeah, like you don't need to know that's tavern on the green.

640
00:44:25,691 --> 00:44:27,158
Rym: But if you're in New York, you do like.

641
00:44:27,299 --> 00:44:29,430
Rym: you got a little extra context, right?

642
00:44:29,831 --> 00:44:39,110
Scott: But I think that if you're not familiar with New York Nothing major is going to be lost on you in this movie, but some small things will be right.

643
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:44,270
Scott: So for example, there's a scene where somebody throws a Timberland boot.

644
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:50,875
Scott: vampire, right Spoiler On the one hand right?

645
00:44:50,895 --> 00:44:55,650
Scott: It's like nothing is lost on the humor of someone throwing a boot at a vampire, right?

646
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:57,978
Scott: It's like that's gonna work no matter who you are.

647
00:44:57,998 --> 00:44:59,764
Scott: No matter what your background is, right?

648
00:44:59,784 --> 00:45:01,008
Scott: You're gonna laugh at that.

649
00:45:01,089 --> 00:45:01,430
Scott: Hopefully.

650
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:10,260
Scott: But if you're New York II you realize the relevance of the Timberland boot Specifically in New York, right?

651
00:45:10,581 --> 00:45:13,210
Scott: It's like part of the New York uniform, you know.

652
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:15,253
Scott: Okay Right.

653
00:45:15,313 --> 00:45:18,188
Scott: It's like especially in the cold or the winter months, right?

654
00:45:18,228 --> 00:45:24,153
Scott: Like Timberlands and like, you know, one of those black pea coats that is like that's a New Yorker No matter where.

655
00:45:24,173 --> 00:45:27,348
Scott: if they're standing in a tropical island, you know, that's a New Yorker.

656
00:45:27,408 --> 00:45:30,790
Rym: or like Why is everyone suddenly going to church in the middle of the night?

657
00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:34,470
Rym: Because of these kids like there's a scene around that like yeah, that would happen.

658
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:37,103
Rym: Yeah, it's like that.

659
00:45:37,123 --> 00:45:37,809
Rym: would you know happen?

660
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:44,649
Scott: exactly, so You know, I think if you're not from New York, you might miss very small things.

661
00:45:45,032 --> 00:45:51,250
Rym: I think it'll be a lot like people who like a lot of Like similar, right, I think it's true.

662
00:45:51,310 --> 00:45:58,484
Scott: Maybe it's more true to say you're not missing anything if you're not New York II But if you are New York II you're gaining something right the special.

663
00:45:58,906 --> 00:46:05,825
Scott: this special sweet You know spice is added to Tease the palette of a New Yorker in this movie.

664
00:46:05,845 --> 00:46:11,181
Rym: Well, like when I was a kid Like I'd like Seinfeld like there's a show I watch but are?

665
00:46:11,221 --> 00:46:17,269
Rym: there's the episode where George Costanza has to like Double park the cars and deal with the cars.

666
00:46:18,171 --> 00:46:22,230
Rym: That did not make any sense to me as a kid like as a kid like I didn't get it.

667
00:46:22,572 --> 00:46:29,983
Rym: I could not understand what the hell the plot of that episode was Because that's really like that's a New York thing and only a New York thing.

668
00:46:30,424 --> 00:46:32,270
Rym: all to decide parking and all that nonsense.

669
00:46:33,371 --> 00:46:37,850
Rym: Yep, exactly, but this movie does not have any moment like that where you'll just be like what the fuck.

670
00:46:38,211 --> 00:46:44,229
Rym: Except maybe the fact that the community would literally like get church to happen because of an incident like that.

671
00:46:45,432 --> 00:46:45,513
Scott: Yep.

672
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:46,055
Scott: All right.

673
00:46:46,095 --> 00:46:48,402
Scott: So also the vampires in this movie.

674
00:46:48,462 --> 00:46:50,268
Scott: It's not ultra gory, right?

675
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:55,785
Rym: So you're not gonna be exactly as gory as the Lost Boys from 1987.

676
00:46:55,785 --> 00:47:02,958
Scott: like that level The vampires are very classical Vampires in terms of the rules around them.

677
00:47:02,978 --> 00:47:09,702
Scott: Yeah, you know and it's actually nice that the Characters in the movie are not dumb, right?

678
00:47:09,783 --> 00:47:14,225
Scott: It's like, you know, you know, usually horror movie You got if you're getting upset because people are playing dumb.

679
00:47:14,266 --> 00:47:14,527
Scott: It's like.

680
00:47:14,588 --> 00:47:17,157
Scott: no These characters like Oh vampires.

681
00:47:17,218 --> 00:47:18,703
Scott: We know all the things about vampires.

682
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:20,108
Scott: One of the kids reads horror novels.

683
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:20,810
Scott: He knows right?

684
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:21,211
Scott: It's like.

685
00:47:21,674 --> 00:47:24,206
Scott: it's like don't invite them in they don't fucking invite them in.

686
00:47:24,226 --> 00:47:24,870
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

687
00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:26,493
Rym: It's just.

688
00:47:26,634 --> 00:47:33,002
Rym: this is why I keep bringing up the Lost Boys because not only is this movie like superficially similar to Lost Boys Like it's almost the same plot.

689
00:47:33,324 --> 00:47:35,395
Rym: people are in a town There's vampires.

690
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:36,299
Rym: the kids figure it out.

691
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:37,485
Rym: the adults don't like.

692
00:47:37,505 --> 00:47:38,289
Rym: how do you deal with it?

693
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:48,123
Rym: But there are some scenes that are beat-for-beat Identical scenes in this movie to scenes in the Lost Boys and there are also.

694
00:47:48,184 --> 00:47:50,530
Rym: you can almost map most of the characters one-to-one.

695
00:47:51,234 --> 00:48:01,928
Rym: Not all the characters obviously because this movie is very New York but there are many characters that map one-to-one like the Character who is legit a vampire hunter in the Lost Boys.

696
00:48:01,948 --> 00:48:07,530
Rym: the same thing There's like the kids who like actually are vampire hunters and like go through the list of what to do with vampires.

697
00:48:07,831 --> 00:48:10,603
Rym: The characters are smart and they go to the church to seal holy water.

698
00:48:10,643 --> 00:48:15,723
Rym: that happens in both of these movies And I think yeah, it's.

699
00:48:16,671 --> 00:48:20,826
Scott: It's basically, you know, I mean to say it's just lost boys for 2020.

700
00:48:20,826 --> 00:48:22,050
Scott: Why would you watch the Lost Boys now?

701
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:23,134
Scott: Just watch this instead.

702
00:48:23,495 --> 00:48:24,057
Scott: kind of true.

703
00:48:24,137 --> 00:48:24,920
Rym: Yeah kind of true.

704
00:48:25,261 --> 00:48:27,790
Rym: Also this movie like Lost Boys is not a diverse movie.

705
00:48:28,232 --> 00:48:33,330
Rym: It was 1987 Hollywood like yeah set in a Wildwood esque place.

706
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:39,787
Rym: But vampires versus the Bronx is just a solid horror movie horror comedy.

707
00:48:39,867 --> 00:48:40,770
Rym: Like it's worth watching.

708
00:48:40,891 --> 00:48:42,789
Scott: Yeah, I don't think there's a lot of horror going on.

709
00:48:45,310 --> 00:48:48,229
Rym: Quote horror genre because it's got Dracula's in it.

710
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:52,990
Rym: But it is not a horror movie so much as it is a. it's mostly a comedy.

711
00:48:54,491 --> 00:48:56,218
Rym: Yeah, it's got touching moments.

712
00:48:56,258 --> 00:48:56,579
Rym: It's a good.

713
00:48:56,619 --> 00:48:57,222
Rym: it's a good movie.

714
00:48:57,242 --> 00:48:58,226
Rym: Like watch it.

715
00:48:58,366 --> 00:48:59,330
Rym: There's no reason not to watch.

716
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:00,455
Rym: I think right.

717
00:49:00,536 --> 00:49:04,916
Scott: I think it's like if you're looking for like a great movie like, you know This is not where you should go.

718
00:49:04,997 --> 00:49:07,650
Scott: But if it's you're here in the Halloween season, right?

719
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:08,393
Scott: Why do you?

720
00:49:08,554 --> 00:49:11,089
Scott: you're gonna watch the same old same old over again, right?

721
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:21,150
Scott: You know, you're gonna watch something like what Garfield Halloween special Pumpkin Law, you know, you're gonna watch, you know some sort of you know, just Halloween.

722
00:49:23,473 --> 00:49:26,777
Scott: Why not watch something new That fits the same bill.

723
00:49:26,957 --> 00:49:28,605
Rym: How have you never seen event horizon?

724
00:49:28,625 --> 00:49:29,570
Rym: Well, I was dealing with the sink.

725
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:32,219
Rym: I overheard everyone talking about what movie we were gonna watch.

726
00:49:32,741 --> 00:49:36,632
Rym: How have no I was like no one in our crew seen event horizon Is it?

727
00:49:36,692 --> 00:49:37,775
Scott: is it that good that I should go say?

728
00:49:37,796 --> 00:49:38,438
Rym: Yeah, it's like.

729
00:49:38,518 --> 00:49:42,090
Rym: it's like a classic for a reason horror space horror movie.

730
00:49:43,411 --> 00:49:45,178
Scott: I don't even know if I. maybe I have seen it.

731
00:49:45,198 --> 00:49:45,861
Scott: I just don't know it.

732
00:49:46,162 --> 00:49:47,828
Scott: I don't know but it's uh, it's.

733
00:49:47,949 --> 00:49:48,110
Rym: there's.

734
00:49:48,972 --> 00:49:52,392
Rym: There's portal to hell stuff going on All right.

735
00:49:52,613 --> 00:49:53,335
Scott: Sure, whatever.

736
00:49:53,435 --> 00:49:58,290
Rym: All right anyway, but yeah spoilers past this point because I want to talk about specific stuff in this movie.

737
00:49:58,390 --> 00:49:59,837
Rym: So stop listening.

738
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:03,976
Rym: if you haven't watched it because the movie is great There's no reason not to watch it.

739
00:50:04,458 --> 00:50:04,900
Rym: and now we're gonna.

740
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,066
Scott: the movie won't be ruined.

741
00:50:06,146 --> 00:50:07,050
Scott: Even if it's spoiled.

742
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:09,001
Rym: No, I mean like spoilers they beat the van.

743
00:50:09,041 --> 00:50:10,690
Rym: everything at the end, right?

744
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:11,472
Scott: It's like it's.

745
00:50:11,753 --> 00:50:14,101
Scott: everything that happens in the movie is kind of obvious.

746
00:50:14,141 --> 00:50:14,361
Scott: There's.

747
00:50:14,422 --> 00:50:16,669
Scott: no there's no surprises really.

748
00:50:16,789 --> 00:50:19,758
Scott: if you're Unless you're a kid, then you'll be surprised.

749
00:50:19,778 --> 00:50:20,421
Rym: There's two scenes.

750
00:50:20,461 --> 00:50:21,305
Rym: I want to be an adult.

751
00:50:21,385 --> 00:50:22,330
Scott: Nothing will surprise you.

752
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:32,678
Rym: The funniest scene to me is when the priest looks up and sees that the three kids are missing Just the way he reacted to.

753
00:50:32,739 --> 00:50:39,557
Rym: that was like the funniest scene in the whole movie But also the way that they they should.

754
00:50:39,597 --> 00:50:43,350
Scott: they use the camera to be from the first-person perspective of the priest.

755
00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:49,070
Rym: Right, there's like pants like an around kid one kid to kid three like he's scanning almost like the Terminator.

756
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:50,954
Scott: Yep, exactly.

757
00:50:50,994 --> 00:50:51,657
Scott: So that was pretty.

758
00:50:52,018 --> 00:50:54,026
Scott: but and then they were mad that he stole.

759
00:50:54,046 --> 00:50:54,930
Scott: they stole his sprite.

760
00:50:55,011 --> 00:50:57,369
Scott: But really they just stole the sprite bottles to put holy water.

761
00:50:59,490 --> 00:51:10,266
Rym: But my favorite scene I think is when they're all in the apartment and the vampire shows up and the kid Tells the mom like don't she's a vampire and the mom believes the kid.

762
00:51:10,346 --> 00:51:11,611
Rym: the mom is just like yeah Like.

763
00:51:11,671 --> 00:51:16,990
Rym: immediately the mom is like, okay, I'm actually gonna listen and I think that's one of the primary themes of this movie.

764
00:51:17,431 --> 00:51:26,169
Rym: This is almost a deconstruction of horror movies because most horror movies especially horror movies made by white people with white people Always have the plot of no one believes the kids.

765
00:51:26,852 --> 00:51:28,960
Rym: People in the community don't trust each other at the start.

766
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,309
Scott: at the start people didn't believe the kids right.

767
00:51:31,349 --> 00:51:34,418
Scott: so much Right, they didn't leave the kids but what they did do?

768
00:51:34,779 --> 00:51:38,670
Rym: they trusted that there was something up because of the way the kids were acting.

769
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:57,680
Rym: there's the theme in this movie that the community in the Bronx is very close-knit and the supposition the vampires had that no one would notice people missing from the Bronx is only true if you ignore the fact that the People in the Bronx will notice and that that community is way tighter than probably most other like many other communities in New York City.

770
00:51:58,862 --> 00:52:03,159
Scott: Mmm for a lot of reasons like yeah, and you could say I did really appreciate that.

771
00:52:03,179 --> 00:52:05,873
Scott: the end It's like how many horror movies end right?

772
00:52:05,913 --> 00:52:14,700
Rym: Like that's the one You know what one Frankenstein's and that way the whole town man's together, but not for the good reasons not for the good reason, right?

773
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:23,380
Scott: It's like when have you seen a horror movie end where it's like, yeah, actually Everyone gets on the same page realizes the bad guys are bad, right?

774
00:52:23,621 --> 00:52:30,065
Rym: You know, yeah when the kids like don't invite her in and the mom it like listens to him and turns and it's like All right, wait up.

775
00:52:30,086 --> 00:52:31,979
Rym: We got to figure out what's going on here, right?

776
00:52:32,681 --> 00:52:32,962
Scott: It's like.

777
00:52:33,002 --> 00:52:37,320
Scott: not only it's like does everyone believe you now, but everyone's gonna work together with you now, right?

778
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:39,148
Scott: Oh in marrow, it just has run away.

779
00:52:39,168 --> 00:52:41,560
Rym: It's the guy who plays Tony in the bodega.

780
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:44,008
Rym: That's marrow from Jesus and marrow, which is just hilarious.

781
00:52:44,329 --> 00:52:51,800
Rym: But the second he figures out the vampires are real He's like, oh shit and immediately calls them like yo, the vampires are real.

782
00:52:53,244 --> 00:52:56,546
Rym: Yep, exactly The whole movie is filled with moments like that.

783
00:52:56,827 --> 00:52:58,833
Rym: Nobody does anything stupid.

784
00:52:59,234 --> 00:53:06,322
Rym: That is not plausible to a normal person mm-hmm, and they don't have the right level of Skepticism.

785
00:53:06,422 --> 00:53:09,432
Rym: like the kids watch blade and suddenly are freaking out about vampires.

786
00:53:09,473 --> 00:53:11,118
Rym: Yeah that tracks that.

787
00:53:11,138 --> 00:53:11,680
Rym: that makes sense

788
00:53:12,582 --> 00:53:15,857
Scott: But except they don't realize that the kids watch they studied the blade

789
00:53:16,158 --> 00:53:31,924
Rym: after I Liked how Most of the vampires were like super stereotypical Like what we do in the shadows vampire vampires to like the fact that when the gang bangers come around the corner the vampires are Standing there.

790
00:53:31,965 --> 00:53:32,348
Rym: They're just like.

791
00:53:32,409 --> 00:53:33,459
Rym: what the fuck?

792
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:35,547
Rym: What is wrong with you?

793
00:53:35,567 --> 00:53:36,553
Rym: Who are you?

794
00:53:36,573 --> 00:53:37,639
Rym: What's going on here?

795
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:38,761
Scott: Mm-hmm.

796
00:53:39,142 --> 00:53:47,250
Scott: I did really appreciate the clever plot point where they managed to combine The gentrification storyline with the vampire storyline.

797
00:53:47,330 --> 00:53:56,119
Scott: Yeah, the vampires were buying the real estate and So that they could enter without being invited because if they own the property then you don't have to invite them in.

798
00:53:56,159 --> 00:53:58,559
Rym: it's their property like literally I'm the landlord now.

799
00:53:59,601 --> 00:54:00,729
Scott: Yeah, so I was like.

800
00:54:00,769 --> 00:54:02,460
Scott: that was just a really clever way.

801
00:54:02,701 --> 00:54:04,771
Scott: It's like, you know, you wanted to tell these two stories.

802
00:54:04,931 --> 00:54:22,280
Scott: one is a metaphor for the other but also Combining it with the actual vampire, you know mythos and mythology that way was extra clever and I think really, you know Even though it was only briefly mentioned It's it was kind of huge and really tied the whole thing together like oh that explains everything and it's really clever.

803
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:22,700
Scott: That's good.

804
00:54:23,162 --> 00:54:35,545
Rym: But also the moment where I knew from the beginning that one rich guy was just they're familiar Like that was that was check out obvious bias the fact that when the kids confront him They're like yo the fuck you.

805
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:36,990
Rym: What do you think the endgame is to this?

806
00:54:37,492 --> 00:54:42,499
Rym: and he's like, yeah, you're right like That was a cool moment that I did not expect.

807
00:54:42,881 --> 00:54:44,870
Scott: That was another cool moment of you know.

808
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:47,400
Scott: adults like listening to the kids and common sense.

809
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:54,600
Scott: Right as opposed to in most horror movies people just you know, denying the truth acting irrationally and causing more trouble, right?

810
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:59,636
Scott: It's like, you know people said things straight up to other people and the people that heard it.

811
00:54:59,837 --> 00:55:02,046
Scott: they heard it and they were like Oh, that's right.

812
00:55:02,267 --> 00:55:08,409
Scott: It's like, you know, once the there was enough evidence to Support what was being said, you know people listen to reason.

813
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:12,080
Rym: the only beat we missed that we should have had was the girl who?

814
00:55:12,803 --> 00:55:14,120
Rym: Already knew how to fight vampires.

815
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:19,213
Rym: We should have seen her take at least one vampire out like that was.

816
00:55:19,635 --> 00:55:21,200
Rym: that was a moment that needed to happen.

817
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:24,880
Scott: She needed a moment exactly like the first person that believes the kid.

818
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:33,267
Scott: Well, the second person that believes the kids right is this girl who you know, totally believes them My grandma's Haitian.

819
00:55:33,287 --> 00:55:33,508
Rym: I've been.

820
00:55:33,649 --> 00:55:36,502
Rym: she's been preparing me for this shit my whole life Right.

821
00:55:36,522 --> 00:55:37,726
Scott: It's like she knew everything.

822
00:55:37,786 --> 00:55:38,689
Scott: She was ready to like.

823
00:55:39,070 --> 00:55:43,458
Scott: it's like, you know, Van Helsing appears suddenly and What does she do though?

824
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:53,660
Rym: Right, all she ends up doing is leaving this the the Fight to go and collect the community and bring them back.

825
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:58,473
Scott: It's like she should have been the one you know to lay down some hammer right.

826
00:55:58,513 --> 00:56:00,779
Rym: at least one hammer like one, right?

827
00:56:01,821 --> 00:56:02,549
Scott: Yeah, she wasn't a mate.

828
00:56:02,569 --> 00:56:03,600
Scott: shows the side character.

829
00:56:03,741 --> 00:56:08,160
Scott: So you can't be like, you know having her, you know, take all the glory right from the main characters.

830
00:56:09,327 --> 00:56:10,399
Rym: There was at least another sum.

831
00:56:11,241 --> 00:56:16,520
Rym: When they they the two other scenes that are like one-to-one mapping with the Lost Boys.

832
00:56:16,782 --> 00:56:19,700
Rym: The Lost Boys has a scene where the kids are like, all right, let's do the smart thing.

833
00:56:20,101 --> 00:56:28,006
Rym: Let's go into their fucking nest during the day and kill him because they can't get us and it fails because of you know they're not actually ready for this.

834
00:56:28,388 --> 00:56:37,752
Rym: that scene is almost the exact same scene from the Lost Boys and the scene where they kill him with where they kill a vampire with the The communion wafer is.

835
00:56:38,541 --> 00:56:41,872
Rym: Also, there's a scene where they kill a vampire with a stereo.

836
00:56:41,912 --> 00:56:44,200
Rym: that was staged very similarly in the Lost Boys.

837
00:56:44,603 --> 00:56:49,354
Rym: There's a bunch of little mappings like that But the other beat from the only beach from the Lost Boys.

838
00:56:49,394 --> 00:56:50,479
Rym: I expected that didn't happen.

839
00:56:51,243 --> 00:57:01,427
Rym: I really thought there was going to be a scene at the very end where the priest comes in again like at the end after they beat all the vampires sees them all and Said something like man.

840
00:57:01,467 --> 00:57:05,301
Rym: I moved to the Bronx to get away from all those fucking vampires Like.

841
00:57:05,341 --> 00:57:13,696
Rym: I expected that because that has been a post climax scene in multiple vampire movies over the years Not just the Lost Boys, but other movies, too.

842
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:20,879
Rym: Mmm, you know at the end where the vampire with our grandpa's just like, you know I moved to San Dimas to get away from all those vampires.

843
00:57:21,922 --> 00:57:24,720
Rym: Or no, what's the problem with San Dimas too many fucking vampires?

844
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:27,065
Rym: So it's not actually San Dimas.

845
00:57:27,125 --> 00:57:32,206
Rym: It's just I've had Bill and Ted on the mind for reasons to yeah But yeah, what else?

846
00:57:32,226 --> 00:57:56,244
Scott: Yeah, if you're looking for if you're looking for a fun Way to spend you know, uh your Halloween watching right your your your stay at home socially distanced internet Halloween party or you know, just your Halloween tradition and you just you know, you want to get that same feeling that you get from all your traditional You know fun Halloween party movies, you know Uh, and you just want to.

Scott: Not the same old over again.

Scott: This is Perfect, right just put it up there in that same pantheon where all the rest, you know.

850
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:09,979

851
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:14,976
Scott: I see no reason why this shouldn't be considered along with the others like oh, it's Halloween.
