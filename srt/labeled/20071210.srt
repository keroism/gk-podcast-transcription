00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:14,157
Scott: I'm Rym, and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:14,739 --> 00:00:18,320
Scott: tonight We have a little chat about people asking us to fix their computers.

5
00:00:24,381 --> 00:00:25,375
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:37,301 --> 00:00:41,056
Rym: I'm sure that'll give all our new listeners the best impression possible of our show.

7
00:00:41,076 --> 00:00:47,820
Scott: oh, yeah Yeah, but you guys quoting a bunch of other guys who are much funnier Oh kind of like how we did at our panel.

8
00:00:48,161 --> 00:01:00,559
Rym: Maybe we kept having these like Simpsons seizures where we just start quoting things to each other Jojo Shabby gabbo gabbo and the audience like half of them be like ah Simpsons and the other half to be like what?

9
00:01:01,801 --> 00:01:02,615
Rym: What's what's what?

10
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,060
Scott: But and then you know who's gonna be a GeekNights listening who's not here?

11
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:16,528
Rym: but seriously to all of you who are new listeners because of the New York anime festival and if our Podcasting live panel was any indication.

12
00:01:16,568 --> 00:01:17,392
Rym: There's a lot of you.

13
00:01:17,412 --> 00:01:26,148
Rym: I want to warn you about something I don't know if you read our little flyer, but GeekNights is four nights a week and Mondays Tuesdays Wednesdays and Thursdays.

14
00:01:26,329 --> 00:01:28,600
Rym: every night is kind of like a different topic like a different show.

15
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:35,571
Scott: It's almost as if we did four different shows each, but each show was weekly so Monday night tonight the rest of the show.

16
00:01:35,612 --> 00:01:37,540
Rym: you know the show format is kind of straightforward.

17
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,162
Rym: We talked about.

18
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:41,875
Rym: you know we do some news in the beginning after our little like hey Scott.

19
00:01:41,895 --> 00:01:43,320
Rym: How's your day going my days going?

20
00:01:43,401 --> 00:01:44,520
Rym: Fine how about yours?

21
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,511
Rym: Then we do some news things of the day.

22
00:01:47,532 --> 00:01:48,175
Rym: you'll figure out what.

23
00:01:48,196 --> 00:01:49,262
Rym: that is pretty quick I hope.

24
00:01:49,302 --> 00:01:50,429
Rym: and then we talk about whatever.

25
00:01:50,449 --> 00:01:52,260
Rym: the topic of the night is.

26
00:01:53,061 --> 00:01:56,640
Rym: Mondays are science and technology and Linux and neckbeards.

27
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,152
Scott: So if you're you know you were at the anime festival.

28
00:02:00,212 --> 00:02:10,232
Scott: presumably if you're a new person to the show Which means your mind is a chance you might not be interested in technology But you're probably more likely to be interested in anime and such.

29
00:02:10,834 --> 00:02:12,500
Scott: so maybe you only want to listen to Wednesday.

30
00:02:12,682 --> 00:02:14,440
Scott: Maybe maybe you do want to listen to Monday.

31
00:02:14,773 --> 00:02:21,185
Rym: Yeah But just so you know and so you don't you know hear us talking about neckbeards and Linux and think I thought they were Doing anime.

32
00:02:21,226 --> 00:02:23,120
Rym: Why were they at the New York anime festival?

33
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,225
Rym: Mondays you know Linux and all that.

34
00:02:25,305 --> 00:02:26,751
Rym: Tuesdays might be up your alley.

35
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:33,999
Rym: It's vid you games video games board games German board games role-playing games gigawing and such.

36
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,631
Rym: Wednesdays are the night you care about.

37
00:02:36,732 --> 00:02:37,700
Rym: anime manga comics.

38
00:02:38,302 --> 00:02:44,480
Rym: It's uh the number one or two anime podcast in the world who knows well at least in the English-speaking world.

39
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:47,095
Rym: You know I assume there's some Japanese podcast about anime.

40
00:02:47,116 --> 00:02:47,800
Rym: That's just awesome.

41
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,743
Scott: There's no way to know.

42
00:02:48,783 --> 00:02:49,686
Scott: with those web stats.

43
00:02:49,706 --> 00:02:53,720
Scott: there could be a million listeners to like you know Joey Jojo's anime podcast.

44
00:02:53,981 --> 00:03:02,973
Rym: Oh, no, I'm pretty sure I know who the top five or six anime podcasts are and I got to say after the top three Or four it's a sharp decline.

45
00:03:03,294 --> 00:03:03,475
Scott: Well.

46
00:03:03,515 --> 00:03:04,238
Scott: That's for certain.

47
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:10,460
Rym: and Thursdays well if you want to hear us argue about things that's probably when you want to listen.

48
00:03:11,461 --> 00:03:15,659
Scott: Yeah, cuz usually that's also the day where you can't think of anything to talk about and we just go.

49
00:03:17,367 --> 00:03:22,938
Rym: So if you thought we were you know hot and awesome at the anime con And you want to hear some anime episodes go to our website.

50
00:03:22,978 --> 00:03:25,547
Rym: You know www.frontrowcrew.com.

51
00:03:25,627 --> 00:03:29,960
Rym: I'm assuming you got there because you're here listening and to all of our normal listeners.

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,460
Scott: I'm sorry we got to go through all this but We'll only be this week next week, we'll stop talking about this bullshit.

53
00:03:35,842 --> 00:03:38,051
Rym: Yeah, at least until we go to another con in February.

54
00:03:38,654 --> 00:03:39,718
Scott: Yeah, yeah, that's all right.

55
00:03:40,241 --> 00:03:43,560
Rym: But you know that all our archives are on the website.

56
00:03:43,761 --> 00:03:52,310
Rym: It's just mp3 so you can just download them and in the iTunes or whatever feeds the RSS They're all in there, and I'm sorry people with dial-up.

57
00:03:52,872 --> 00:03:55,499
Scott: Yeah easily can't listen to podcast if you have dial-up.

58
00:03:55,763 --> 00:03:56,299
Rym: Well not yet.

59
00:03:56,441 --> 00:04:00,909
Rym: I mean I'm kind of thinking about making a dial-up Slash low bandwidth feed.

60
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:06,919
Rym: so I guess for all of you out there If you think that that would in any way be of interest to you or anyone you know let me know.

61
00:04:07,582 --> 00:04:11,720
Rym: It wouldn't take that much effort for me to make an extra like eight megabyte.

62
00:04:12,443 --> 00:04:13,770
Scott: Put it in a separate feed though.

63
00:04:14,332 --> 00:04:16,982
Rym: I got some ideas all right Right.

64
00:04:17,404 --> 00:04:18,993
Rym: so uh in the news.

65
00:04:19,173 --> 00:04:20,139
Rym: I'll let Scott go first.

66
00:04:20,742 --> 00:04:25,860
Scott: Okay, well I basically have all tech things of the day and no tech news.

67
00:04:26,002 --> 00:04:27,257
Scott: So I'm just like uh.

68
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:37,982
Rym: But fortuitously We acquired an item that we've been looking for for a long time and Scott is probably the the biggest person in terms of getting This done.

69
00:04:38,262 --> 00:04:43,820
Scott: well basically you know we have in our living room the TV, and it's the only TV in the house.

70
00:04:43,941 --> 00:04:45,560
Scott: But it doesn't actually get television.

71
00:04:45,741 --> 00:04:50,099
Scott: It's just what it's got a Wii and a Mac hooked up to it as a Wii and a Mac mini connected to it.

72
00:04:50,963 --> 00:04:55,400
Scott: The only thing is that the the speakers on the TV are not so great.

73
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,171
Scott: I mean they're fine for sitting there playing video games.

74
00:04:58,211 --> 00:04:59,456
Scott: They're fine for sitting there.

75
00:04:59,878 --> 00:05:04,014
Scott: You know Listening to music or watching a movie, but very often.

76
00:05:04,034 --> 00:05:12,047
Scott: I would find myself say cooking in the kitchen wanting to listen to some music and TV speakers not cutting it.

77
00:05:12,368 --> 00:05:15,820
Rym: no the worst thing before that we did have hooked up to the TV.

78
00:05:16,645 --> 00:05:21,880
Rym: You know you go to like Best Buy, and you see those Stereo systems that they sell to a punk kid to put in his room.

79
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,920
Rym: It's like a gigantic stereo with two speakers coming off of it.

80
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:28,360
Scott: Yeah, it's like a boombox, but on crack, and you can't actually move it.

81
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,447
Scott: You just sort of put it on like your dresser or on a shelf And it just works from.

82
00:05:32,507 --> 00:05:34,220
Scott: and you can also like bring it to the beach or whatever.

83
00:05:34,521 --> 00:05:37,174
Rym: I had one of those from when I was in you know like middle school.

84
00:05:37,476 --> 00:05:38,300
Scott: I have one of those.

85
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,088
Scott: It's still in my room am I?

86
00:05:40,128 --> 00:05:51,832
Rym: so it was hooked up to our TV for the longest time until Well one day Scott knocked it over and then Kate knocked it over another day and one thing Because you put it on this precarious thing which is much smaller than it.

87
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:54,800
Rym: Yeah, I guess I'll admit it wasn't too stable.

88
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,815
Rym: I mean if someone kicks it as hard as they can I think it's gonna fall over.

89
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:05,259
Scott: no matter what I do kidding if Breeze of wind blew in the wrong direction that thing would fall over.

90
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,928
Rym: You know we did fine You can't put.

91
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:12,075
Scott: you can't put a vase Like balancing on top of a pyramid and then blame someone.

92
00:06:12,115 --> 00:06:13,180
Scott: if you they knock it off.

93
00:06:13,802 --> 00:06:19,900
Scott: Stereo on top of a milk crate against the wall a very small milk crate balanced precariously on top of another small.

94
00:06:20,602 --> 00:06:22,348
Scott: It was very precarious.

95
00:06:22,409 --> 00:06:25,258
Scott: You just for some reason wobbled back and forth with like.

96
00:06:25,299 --> 00:06:28,757
Rym: yes Yeah, I'll admit it wobbled when you kicked it.

97
00:06:28,777 --> 00:06:33,639
Scott: no What plus it was directly at the foot of my bed where my feet go?

98
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,519
Rym: Suffice to say that stereo is no more.

99
00:06:38,542 --> 00:06:39,807
Rym: It is ceased to be.

100
00:06:39,827 --> 00:06:42,640
Rym: I think it still had some CDs in it when I threw it away.

101
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:46,320
Scott: It is gone to meet its main thing the best part about that stereo.

102
00:06:46,682 --> 00:06:53,840
Rym: It had a CD changer which back in when I was in middle school was like The hot shit if you hadn't nailed it to the milk crate.

103
00:06:57,455 --> 00:06:59,766
Rym: But It stopped working one day.

104
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:05,760
Rym: like it was this cartridge based thing like it had cartridges inside of it as I found out when I Smashed it open one day to throw it away.

105
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,249
Rym: You know whenever you throw away technology you smash it open first.

106
00:07:08,951 --> 00:07:12,931
Scott: It's just what you do, but especially technology We have no idea what the hell's inside.

107
00:07:12,972 --> 00:07:13,980
Scott: I mean a computer.

108
00:07:14,161 --> 00:07:16,388
Scott: I know it's inside a CD changer.

109
00:07:16,689 --> 00:07:18,957
Scott: who knows how the hell that thing moves those CDs around.

110
00:07:19,017 --> 00:07:19,980
Rym: I was kind of surprised.

111
00:07:20,102 --> 00:07:23,808
Rym: It was a lot less Robust than I'd expected, but then again.

112
00:07:23,828 --> 00:07:26,240
Rym: I should have expected much because it hadn't worked for like three years.

113
00:07:26,501 --> 00:07:27,668
Rym: Yeah, but that's the thing.

114
00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:29,077
Rym: it hadn't worked for like three years.

115
00:07:29,117 --> 00:07:34,920
Rym: like one day It just stopped working and anytime I hit the button it would like chug chug chug inside and nothing would happen.

116
00:07:35,382 --> 00:07:36,608
Rym: And I had a couple CDs there.

117
00:07:36,628 --> 00:07:38,456
Rym: I couldn't get out and I couldn't get more CDs in.

118
00:07:38,536 --> 00:07:40,446
Scott: so whatever It was the day of mp3s.

119
00:07:40,466 --> 00:07:45,208
Rym: We didn't give a shit, but the thing is you know we used it And we left one of our friends home one day.

120
00:07:45,248 --> 00:07:47,979
Rym: She was sick while the rest of us went out to get child Japanese food.

121
00:07:47,999 --> 00:07:55,340
Rym: and She calls me she's like yeah, I put a CD in your stereo, and now it won't play and it won't come out.

122
00:07:56,241 --> 00:07:57,145
Rym: And I'm like wait a minute.

123
00:07:57,165 --> 00:07:57,848
Rym: What stereo.

124
00:07:57,888 --> 00:07:58,812
Rym: We don't have a stereo.

125
00:07:59,394 --> 00:08:00,579
Rym: Oh, you know the one in your living room.

126
00:08:01,282 --> 00:08:03,310
Rym: How the hell did you get a CD in that thing?

127
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,819
Scott: hey it wouldn't come out as we share.

128
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:07,094
Rym: somehow She got it to take a CD.

129
00:08:08,181 --> 00:08:14,218
Rym: Yeah Magic, I guess, but yeah, it's gone and the TV speakers weren't cutting it.

130
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:18,918
Scott: no So we're sitting here, and what are our options for TV speakers?

131
00:08:18,978 --> 00:08:19,420
Scott: right well?

132
00:08:19,901 --> 00:08:23,396
Scott: We could go and get some crazy surround sound thing, but what the hell's the point of that?

133
00:08:23,497 --> 00:08:24,300
Scott: see now?

134
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,394
Rym: We did a show about that before and I guess I should clarify that There's nothing wrong with surround sound.

135
00:08:29,414 --> 00:08:30,080
Rym: I guess pretty cool.

136
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:37,474
Rym: But for our house and the kind of things we do in our house is not worth the time and the effort and our incredibly Poor acoustic living room.

137
00:08:37,494 --> 00:08:41,832
Rym: yes There is suffice to say I said that phrase a lot of times.

138
00:08:41,873 --> 00:08:45,040
Scott: so if I say it a million times every show I do There is mr.

139
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:49,920
Scott: Suffice shall we say say Rym says suffice to say a lot if I may.

140
00:08:50,482 --> 00:08:52,770
Rym: There's an echo in our living room as it is.

141
00:08:53,312 --> 00:08:55,620
Rym: we don't need five speakers echoing.

142
00:08:55,963 --> 00:09:05,537
Scott: Yeah, basically all we needed was some speakers That would be loud enough to where you could hear them in the next room and also Maybe be a little better than the TV ones you know for a movie or whatever.

143
00:09:05,557 --> 00:09:10,826
Rym: now every Receiver we looked at was even if we were only gonna use it with two speakers Was months.

144
00:09:10,866 --> 00:09:11,891
Rym: it was monstrosity.

145
00:09:11,911 --> 00:09:13,439
Rym: it was bigger than everything hooked up to.

146
00:09:13,479 --> 00:09:18,480
Scott: yeah I mean come by I got my dad's old receiver cuz he got a new one right and the thing is huge.

147
00:09:18,701 --> 00:09:22,420
Scott: Remember under our television is a Mac Mini and a Wii two very small things.

148
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:25,060
Scott: The receiver would have been bigger than both of those combined.

149
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,923
Scott: We're bigger than like.

150
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:27,670
Scott: it's as big as like eight Mac Minis.

151
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:30,460
Rym: Maybe no big as like two or three Ataris.

152
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:31,282
Scott: It's.

153
00:09:31,403 --> 00:09:34,462
Scott: it's as wide as like Nine wheeze.

154
00:09:34,603 --> 00:09:35,967
Rym: it's almost as big as your mom.

155
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:36,790
Rym: It's huge.

156
00:09:37,231 --> 00:09:39,398
Scott: It's like two VCR stacked on top of each other.

157
00:09:39,438 --> 00:09:41,521
Scott: It's ginormous Right.

158
00:09:41,763 --> 00:09:47,227
Scott: so putting that under there, especially with the amount of electricity a thing like that takes It's just like forget about it.

159
00:09:47,268 --> 00:09:49,640
Rym: That is that is not yeah like we plug it in the lights dim.

160
00:09:50,062 --> 00:09:54,280
Scott: Yeah another option we can go and try to buy some like PC speakers or something like that.

161
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,628
Scott: You know a little 2.1 system you meant for computers.

162
00:09:56,869 --> 00:10:00,060
Scott: use that but you know that speakers be so small?

163
00:10:00,342 --> 00:10:02,780
Scott: You know physically like where would we put them really?

164
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,700
Scott: I mean where you know this is the TVs on this stand.

165
00:10:06,102 --> 00:10:10,163
Scott: You know we need speakers that can go on the floor on us on the wall or something While

166
00:10:10,203 --> 00:10:17,440
Rym: I have a subwoofer in my room for music and all that Just because most of the time we spend with our friends in the house is hanging out and playing video games and stuff.

167
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,846
Rym: We don't really need the big subwoofer.

168
00:10:18,887 --> 00:10:20,333
Scott: and also the subwoofer would buy.

169
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:21,720
Scott: the lady understood downstairs.

170
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:28,760
Rym: But most of all like computer speakers for some reason the subwoofer is bigger than like every speaker combined.

171
00:10:28,883 --> 00:10:29,700
Rym: It's gigantic.

172
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:30,804
Scott: Yeah, like.

173
00:10:30,944 --> 00:10:33,894
Scott: maybe you know if I lives if I got a bigger room.

174
00:10:33,954 --> 00:10:40,239
Scott: I could use because my computer I have a 5.1 system that was larger than I thought it was gonna be when I bought it.

175
00:10:40,882 --> 00:10:43,997
Scott: I would have gotten a smaller one, and I mistakenly bought a larger one.

176
00:10:44,017 --> 00:10:45,523
Rym: the box came Like what did Scott buy?

177
00:10:45,563 --> 00:10:46,165
Rym: a mini fridge?

178
00:10:46,366 --> 00:10:46,848
Scott: Yeah?

179
00:10:46,888 --> 00:10:48,654
Rym: Why it's huge right?

180
00:10:48,694 --> 00:10:51,599
Scott: I would have bought a smaller one, but oh well Why don't we buy a mini fridge?

181
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,496
Scott: Because we don't have a. we don't have a big enough house yet to warrant one yet.

182
00:10:56,997 --> 00:10:57,720
Scott: Yeah anyway.

183
00:10:58,761 --> 00:11:00,568
Scott: So what am I gonna do here right?

184
00:11:00,688 --> 00:11:01,712
Scott: I needed a 2.1 or 2.0 speaker system.

185
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,880
Scott: That'd be good for a living room.

186
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,380
Scott: So you go shop around for these things and the prices on them are ludicrous or the size of the things is ludicrous.

187
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:11,585
Scott: There was just.

188
00:11:12,128 --> 00:11:15,020
Scott: no matter where I look there was no sufficient product.

189
00:11:15,201 --> 00:11:16,448
Scott: You know I mean eat.

190
00:11:16,488 --> 00:11:18,820
Scott: the only things that I saw that were almost acceptable.

191
00:11:19,122 --> 00:11:21,316
Scott: You could get like you know like we had before.

192
00:11:21,417 --> 00:11:24,747
Scott: one of those meant for like your dresser in your bedroom.

193
00:11:24,808 --> 00:11:28,858
Scott: stereo systems are meant for the you know to put on the shelf stereo things.

194
00:11:29,239 --> 00:11:32,136
Scott: they have A CD changer, and they play mp3 CDs.

195
00:11:34,423 --> 00:11:35,067
Rym: Open those things.

196
00:11:35,107 --> 00:11:43,784
Rym: there's not so much inside of it was kind of like the V. It's just a couple of little circuit boards a lot of empty space because they wanted to look big impressive for the 14-year-old to buy him.

197
00:11:44,085 --> 00:11:48,400
Scott: yeah, it's like it's like a whole stereo unit as he might even have a cassette tape slot.

198
00:11:48,581 --> 00:11:49,283
Rym: No, it won't.

199
00:11:49,384 --> 00:11:50,809
Rym: some of them do not anymore.

200
00:11:50,829 --> 00:11:54,665
Scott: You know has an FM AM radio in it, and it's got all this shit I don't want right.

201
00:11:54,786 --> 00:11:58,149
Scott: all I want is audio in Speakers out.

202
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,379
Scott: that's all I need right?

203
00:12:00,082 --> 00:12:05,940
Scott: So I'm looking for such a product and the only product I can find is this thing called the sonic t amp.

204
00:12:06,622 --> 00:12:07,925
Scott: It's just an amplifier.

205
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:08,767
Scott: it takes in.

206
00:12:08,787 --> 00:12:10,973
Scott: you know the say it takes the audio.

207
00:12:10,993 --> 00:12:12,436
Scott: stereo audio goes in.

208
00:12:12,757 --> 00:12:19,100
Scott: you know with the same plug You use for like headphones on your iPod and then speaker wire comes out to two speakers.

209
00:12:19,642 --> 00:12:20,526
Scott: You could even power.

210
00:12:20,546 --> 00:12:25,899
Scott: you can plug it into the wall, or you can put eight double A's in it So you don't even you can use this like on the road.

211
00:12:26,841 --> 00:12:29,252
Scott: It's like if you go somewhere in the middle of nowhere.

212
00:12:29,272 --> 00:12:30,879
Scott: you can put some batteries in this.

213
00:12:31,422 --> 00:12:37,908
Scott: Take a little wire plug your iPod into it, and then have speakers And you can get it to be loud, and it's pretty cool.

214
00:12:38,249 --> 00:12:42,020
Rym: now the deal is it's basically a digital amplifier.

215
00:12:42,522 --> 00:12:43,887
Scott: That's pretty much all it is.

216
00:12:44,188 --> 00:12:46,477
Rym: and now some audio files out there.

217
00:12:46,537 --> 00:12:52,433
Rym: out there might say But you can hear the difference with the harsher sound Strangely enough right.

218
00:12:52,473 --> 00:12:58,555
Scott: this product Which is not Randy or audio file in any way is sort of lauded by audio files.

219
00:12:58,636 --> 00:13:00,220
Scott: They are like hooray this thing is awesome.

220
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,585
Scott: They don't really say it's awesome.

221
00:13:01,605 --> 00:13:04,959
Scott: like you know I would use it for my stereo system in my house.

222
00:13:05,099 --> 00:13:09,180
Scott: awesome Cuz you know they're audio files, and they have to get a $5,000 stereo system with the tubes.

223
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,291
Scott: But they say it's awesome for the value.

224
00:13:11,311 --> 00:13:12,860
Scott: They're like oh my god for 80 bucks.

225
00:13:13,181 --> 00:13:17,563
Scott: This is this is better than things that cost a few hundred dollars not better than things That's knows.

226
00:13:18,025 --> 00:13:19,550
Scott: at least that's what audio files say.

227
00:13:19,851 --> 00:13:22,240
Scott: so in the real world this thing is fantastic.

228
00:13:22,421 --> 00:13:22,762
Scott: It's it's.

229
00:13:23,043 --> 00:13:24,407
Scott: I'd say what else do you need?

230
00:13:24,547 --> 00:13:24,668
Scott: you?

231
00:13:24,688 --> 00:13:28,600
Scott: freaking is unless you want surround sound is as good as it gets 80 bucks.

232
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,075
Scott: Stereo sound comes in speakers come out, and it gets pretty loud.

233
00:13:33,095 --> 00:13:34,641
Scott: That's the one worry I had.

234
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:39,075
Scott: I mean it's only like 15 watts per channel plugged in and I think 10 watts per channel.

235
00:13:39,376 --> 00:13:47,319
Scott: if you're using battery power and If your speakers are kind of crummy you might not be able to get it to be very loud Or you might not to be able to get it to be very loud.

236
00:13:47,801 --> 00:13:52,998
Scott: You know with without a lot of noise on the lawn and that you know that's sort of it's like great.

237
00:13:53,018 --> 00:13:58,320
Scott: if it works You know that's one thing, but if I can't hear it and I have to crank it up all the way It's basically not working.

238
00:13:59,402 --> 00:14:03,100
Scott: But to my surprise I bought these two big America speakers.

239
00:14:03,281 --> 00:14:05,914
Scott: It was two speakers for a hundred bucks a bottom on Amazon.

240
00:14:05,934 --> 00:14:10,640
Rym: the only problem with them Is that they are much too heavy to bring to a convention and put on a table?

241
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,514
Scott: Yeah, they're pretty heavy, but they're you know they're just nice wooden bookshelf speakers.

242
00:14:14,595 --> 00:14:16,222
Rym: Yeah, they're not coming to Katsu Ka.

243
00:14:16,363 --> 00:14:17,552
Scott: no there were two of them.

244
00:14:17,854 --> 00:14:18,640
Scott: They were hundred dollars.

245
00:14:18,801 --> 00:14:19,408
Scott: I plugged him in.

246
00:14:19,428 --> 00:14:27,559
Scott: I got a spool of cheap ass speaker wire from Radio Shack like nine bucks for because the only better speaker wire you're gonna find is straight-up lamp cord.

247
00:14:28,382 --> 00:14:30,339
Scott: No, they had monster speaker wire there.

248
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:35,034
Scott: That was it actually surprisingly was only $15 for the spool of monster speaker wire.

249
00:14:35,215 --> 00:14:36,840
Scott: Wow there's only slightly more money.

250
00:14:37,161 --> 00:14:38,125
Rym: You know why I'll bet.

251
00:14:38,185 --> 00:14:45,180
Rym: I know why because the kinds of people who buy monster cables and think they're better Aren't the kind of people who are gonna buy a spool of wire?

252
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,453
Rym: They're going to buy a piece of wire that has connectors on both ends.

253
00:14:48,574 --> 00:14:51,017
Scott: Yeah, I didn't actually see those there But I'm sure they were somewhere.

254
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,374
Scott: Regardless I bought the cheap speaker wire on a spool.

255
00:14:54,635 --> 00:14:57,398
Scott: I cut it myself I plugged it in and we're good to go.

256
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:03,740
Scott: So if anyone out there wants stereo sound or perhaps you know you think about buying one of those iPod docks.

257
00:15:04,242 --> 00:15:06,651
Scott: Or you're thinking about you know something along those lines.

258
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:08,960
Scott: I recommend to you the sonic t-amp.

259
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:15,132
Scott: There's a pro sonic t-amp But I can't really figure out why it's better than the regular t-amp and this.

260
00:15:15,232 --> 00:15:18,665
Scott: actually I bought the second generation of the plain T amp.

261
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:20,018
Scott: there's now a new version of it.

262
00:15:20,422 --> 00:15:22,072
Scott: So just go to think geek and you'll be able to.

263
00:15:22,092 --> 00:15:23,199
Scott: you'll be sure you get the right one.

264
00:15:23,764 --> 00:15:24,411
Scott: It's not too hard.

265
00:15:24,936 --> 00:15:28,628
Rym: so I Was reading law.com the other day.

266
00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:30,014
Scott: law.com you say.

267
00:15:30,194 --> 00:15:34,228
Rym: well actually I was reading slash jot And they linked to law.com not grok law.com.

268
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:34,830
Rym: No.

269
00:15:34,951 --> 00:15:41,680
Rym: I've never been to law.com before alright, but Articles like this come up pretty regularly.

270
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,743
Rym: It's like every year.

271
00:15:42,904 --> 00:15:54,079
Rym: Maybe every half year depending on what's going on an article pop up somewhere talking about how People write stuff in email, and they forget that other people might have a copy of it.

272
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,566
Rym: Yes, but this is talking about.

273
00:15:57,586 --> 00:16:06,108
Rym: it's basically general counsel's talking to you know employees and people and saying alright Listen if you send something in an email.

274
00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:07,391
Rym: There's a record of it.

275
00:16:07,792 --> 00:16:21,819
Rym: Don't say incriminating things if you're gonna be in a lawsuit hahaha, and it goes on and on and I still I don't know I This really kind of bothers me that even to this day I mean email has been around for a long time.

276
00:16:22,442 --> 00:16:26,855
Rym: But a lot of people just when it comes to electronic communication don't seem to get it like.

277
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:31,313
Rym: they don't seem to just quite understand The fact that if you put something on a computer.

278
00:16:31,433 --> 00:16:38,980
Rym: It's pretty much there forever Especially if it's on someone else's computer - especially if someone wants it to be around forever.

279
00:16:40,482 --> 00:16:46,166
Scott: You know like you've got a business where they want everything to be around forever or where there's some sort of server That's keeping everything around forever.

280
00:16:46,427 --> 00:16:47,110
Rym: Yep, though.

281
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:49,600
Rym: I think the worst thing is kind of tangentially related to this.

282
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,849
Rym: But there's been a lot of stories of late about Congressmen or various companies.

283
00:16:54,869 --> 00:16:58,435
Rym: you know oh we lost all the email, so I'm sorry We can't give it to you.

284
00:16:59,201 --> 00:17:03,132
Rym: And there's really almost no way that can happen unless shenanigans are happening.

285
00:17:03,694 --> 00:17:06,782
Rym: and even in a in a fairly incompetent IT environment.

286
00:17:07,365 --> 00:17:12,884
Scott: you really can't just lose email especially in that quad unless you do it on purpose And you need to get like.

287
00:17:13,807 --> 00:17:15,351
Scott: it's pretty hard to do it on purpose.

288
00:17:15,412 --> 00:17:25,231
Scott: Especially like if you don't know about computers Then it it then there's no way you could have gotten rid of the emails You would have actively had to do something to get rid of them.

289
00:17:26,115 --> 00:17:26,939
Rym: now even better.

290
00:17:27,982 --> 00:17:30,680
Rym: See I remember I had arguments with people in RIT a lot.

291
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:36,320
Rym: I haven't had this argument recently, but I wonder if anyone out there is going to say something, but I you trolling.

292
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:47,339
Rym: I Have a record of every conversation I've had online either an email well except I lost some emails when I switched from RIT's account, but I keep everything now.

293
00:17:47,822 --> 00:17:51,800
Rym: But every email I am chat everything anything any text anyone ever sends me.

294
00:17:52,221 --> 00:18:02,167
Scott: I still have yeah all my at least all my gene anything anyone's ever sent me or I've said anyone on Gmail I still have except for spam and I lost all.

295
00:18:02,187 --> 00:18:03,656
Scott: I had chat logs, and I lost him.

296
00:18:03,696 --> 00:18:04,360
Scott: I had chat logs.

297
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:08,840
Scott: I lost him, but now I have chat logs at least with people who are using jabber.

298
00:18:09,261 --> 00:18:10,847
Scott: I have those chat logs forever.

299
00:18:10,867 --> 00:18:11,570
Scott: I can google.

300
00:18:11,771 --> 00:18:12,774
Rym: I mean I remember way back.

301
00:18:13,075 --> 00:18:14,300
Scott: Google also has them forever.

302
00:18:14,783 --> 00:18:22,026
Rym: I remember I looked and I saw I had that the first message I'd ever sent to Scott when we were freshmen in college, and I was like hey I'm that guy who did blah blah blah.

303
00:18:22,347 --> 00:18:31,818
Rym: or you want to go to that anime club something something get dinner at Gracie's with all the other cool people and I had already been to that anime club something.

304
00:18:31,858 --> 00:18:37,199
Rym: yep I had missed that anime club because I had to go to that economics class that I promptly dropped haha.

305
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:45,314
Rym: But enough of that.

306
00:18:45,414 --> 00:18:49,710
Rym: I don't really have much more insightful to say about email, and it is time for things of the day.

307
00:18:50,173 --> 00:18:51,989
Scott: Okay, have you got a good one actually?

308
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:52,832
Rym: I think I do.

309
00:18:52,852 --> 00:18:58,130
Rym: I came across this kind of randomly, but it's pictures of people and other things.

310
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:02,550
Rym: But the first two are people made of people and that's not so special.

311
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:07,469
Rym: There's been a lot of times where someone gets a bunch of people together to make a shape or something take a picture of it.

312
00:19:08,477 --> 00:19:23,970
Rym: These are from World War one like 1915 1917 era and they're super old and it's kind of cool to look at What everyone looks really kind of sad and frumpy in these pictures, but that's how you'd be if you were in World War one.

313
00:19:24,231 --> 00:19:25,597
Rym: Yeah, at the same time.

314
00:19:26,058 --> 00:19:27,966
Rym: It's really kind of fascinating to look at these things.

315
00:19:28,007 --> 00:19:32,790
Rym: They're very nationalistic and very I don't know.

316
00:19:33,835 --> 00:19:39,951
Rym: Check them out and I'm not sure exactly what I have to say about them beyond that other than it's kind of interesting to look back in time and see

317
00:19:40,393 --> 00:19:42,402
Scott: people thought of this a long time ago, and

318
00:19:43,106 --> 00:19:47,505
Rym: well, you know People thinking of things a long time ago has never surprised me and

319
00:19:47,545 --> 00:19:49,815
Scott: it's people are still doing it today And it's still kind of cool.

320
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:50,599
Rym: Yeah.

321
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,648
Rym: Yeah, but a lot of people look really kind of in these pictures.

322
00:19:55,491 --> 00:19:58,083
Scott: Yeah, they're being forced to do it because they were in some sort of army.

323
00:19:58,223 --> 00:19:59,670
Rym: I think they're all US Army folks.

324
00:20:00,398 --> 00:20:05,510
Rym: I didn't read the full story But these are some old pictures and some of them are pretty well done as in.

325
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:08,241
Rym: I've seen a lot of crowds doing things like this today.

326
00:20:08,282 --> 00:20:09,487
Rym: that did a much worse job.

327
00:20:09,949 --> 00:20:23,129
Scott: Yep All right, speaking of military actions, you know, sometimes there's something you don't know a lot about but you see it And you know that it's somewhat odd, you know that it's awesome and special, but you don't know enough to explain why.

328
00:20:23,712 --> 00:20:34,067
Scott: Aha, like you don't know anything about painting but you see a painting and you know That's like one of the best paintings there is but you don't know any words or you know You can't tell someone why because you never studied art, you know, something like that.

329
00:20:34,248 --> 00:20:37,250
Scott: No Well, basically that's sort of that's what my thing of the day is.

330
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:44,630
Scott: I don't know anything about fighter jets whatsoever except they fly and they have jets and they can shoot missiles and have guns.

331
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:48,730
Scott: Sometimes and sometimes one person flies it and sometimes two people.

332
00:20:49,353 --> 00:21:07,170
Scott: But this is some Russian jet called the su-30 MK And I'm watching videos of this thing flying and here's a whole bunch of them here and From what I can read in my limited understanding of it This is pretty much the most capable flying machine ever created and it's pretty amazing.

333
00:21:07,271 --> 00:21:17,219
Scott: And one of these videos is funny because it shows them Blowing one of them up by accident because they scraped the ground but during like a French air show or something But the guy eject.

334
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:23,430
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty funny watching them eject But because they're so close to the ground when they eject it's it's okay.

335
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:33,014
Scott: But the other videos actually show the thing flying and in one of the videos it flies around With like these Reds, you know red smoke coming out of you know The the wing tips.

336
00:21:33,436 --> 00:21:39,161
Scott: that way I guess if you're down on the ground you can sort of tell how it's moving based on You know the red smoke and whatnot.

337
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:40,170
Rym: Also, it looks cool.

338
00:21:40,402 --> 00:21:48,150
Scott: Yeah also looks cool and this thing can fly in ways that remind me only of The Valkyries from macro.

339
00:21:48,371 --> 00:21:51,279
Rym: I was about to ask if you were gonna say something about macross.

340
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,974
Scott: perhaps it also, you know from what I understand I'm not sure if I'm correct.

341
00:21:56,336 --> 00:21:58,303
Scott: This thing flies the same way.

342
00:21:58,664 --> 00:22:00,170
Scott: the Valkyries and macross fly.

343
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:05,750
Scott: It's got the two jets that point backwards and the things that aim the jet whatnot.

344
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:08,258
Scott: So it looks like it's basically thrust vectoring.

345
00:22:08,478 --> 00:22:12,110
Rym: Yes, that's been around in fighter jets for a long time Scott.

346
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:14,849
Rym: Well, anyway, the most fighter jets use thrust vectoring.

347
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:19,530
Scott: Well, anyway, this one is better than any other one supposedly at least anyone.

348
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:23,224
Scott: That's not secret that you can watch videos of on the Internet's right?

349
00:22:23,726 --> 00:22:24,810
Rym: So I'm not sure.

350
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,843
Rym: I think we did a show similar to this before.

351
00:22:26,863 --> 00:22:27,889
Scott: I'm gonna search right now.

352
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,849
Rym: Well, we're gonna take a slightly different tack here.

353
00:22:30,312 --> 00:22:48,610
Rym: But a lot of you out there may or may not be technology people or you know like the local Linux guy or the guy who your friends all think all he knows about computers, but a lot of people ask us Personally to fix their computers for them and it's a little bit not so easy.

354
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:51,035
Scott: Yeah, I mean really.

355
00:22:51,055 --> 00:22:55,870
Scott: I mean, you know, this is that old stereotype of you know, I will not fix your computer for you.

356
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:58,650
Scott: Do not ask the computer guy to fix your computer.

357
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:06,115
Rym: you know the Bafa the bastard operator from hell which if you don't know who the bastard operator from hell is I Suggest you look for that.

358
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:08,044
Rym: I'll make it my thing of the day in the future.

359
00:23:08,105 --> 00:23:09,170
Scott: Yeah, maybe it should have been.

360
00:23:09,752 --> 00:23:12,082
Rym: Yeah, well the thing is I assume everyone's read that.

361
00:23:12,143 --> 00:23:13,770
Rym: I mean I read that when I was in like middle school.

362
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,819
Scott: Yeah, I don't remember when I read it, but I read it.

363
00:23:16,999 --> 00:23:19,087
Rym: I didn't even know about computers, but I understood.

364
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:26,890
Scott: Yep Anyway So yeah, I haven't found any old episode of us talking about this.

365
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:27,875
Scott: So let's just go with it.

366
00:23:27,975 --> 00:23:32,780
Scott: And even if we've talked about it before it was so long ago It had to be one of the earliest episodes.

367
00:23:32,901 --> 00:23:34,410
Scott: It's it's good enough to do a recap.

368
00:23:34,495 --> 00:23:36,900
Rym: well the thing that happens the most I think this is the.

369
00:23:37,061 --> 00:23:45,897
Rym: the interesting part for me is that a Lot of people will ask me or you know people who are IT or CS professionals like hey, I got a computer problem can you fix it?

370
00:23:46,969 --> 00:23:52,630
Rym: and They always seem amazed that usually we can't fix it or that they're like man your computer guy.

371
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:53,997
Rym: How come you don't know how to do X?

372
00:23:54,741 --> 00:23:56,390
Rym: and I think there's a lot of reasons for that.

373
00:23:56,551 --> 00:23:57,688
Rym: Shall we get into all the reasons?

374
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:05,490
Scott: Okay, and reason number one that I have is that people just have a problem where there may be a fix.

375
00:24:06,172 --> 00:24:16,281
Scott: But the fix is sort of not possible or not Satisfactory or not complete or you know, it's not what they want.

376
00:24:16,322 --> 00:24:16,983
Scott: For example.

377
00:24:17,525 --> 00:24:19,550
Scott: Hey, I got my computer full of viruses.

378
00:24:19,911 --> 00:24:21,095
Scott: Can you restore it to new?

379
00:24:21,637 --> 00:24:24,285
Scott: they're assuming that it can be restored to like new.

380
00:24:24,345 --> 00:24:25,690
Scott: it's like no pretty much.

381
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:28,002
Scott: It would take me if that was possible, right?

382
00:24:28,042 --> 00:24:29,489
Scott: It's like what's the most you can do?

383
00:24:29,933 --> 00:24:34,523
Scott: You can run some antivirus You can run some spywares and adware remove or

384
00:24:34,805 --> 00:24:39,824
Rym: I could spend four hours Backing everything you have up and then reinstalling windows

385
00:24:39,864 --> 00:24:40,747
Scott: and then scaling

386
00:24:40,827 --> 00:24:47,249
Rym: all the patches Scanning everything that I took off your computer putting it all back on in that amount of time.

387
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:48,978
Rym: Well, not in that about us.

388
00:24:49,018 --> 00:24:49,782
Rym: I'm not gonna do it.

389
00:24:50,103 --> 00:24:51,350
Rym: I don't have four hours to kill.

390
00:24:51,872 --> 00:24:58,689
Scott: Yeah, and it's like that's not really a satisfactory solution because it's like, you know You got to back up all this stuff or maybe a lot of the stuff is lost, you know.

391
00:24:59,312 --> 00:25:02,085
Scott: It's like, you know, hey my engine seized.

392
00:25:02,145 --> 00:25:03,149
Scott: Can you fix my car?

393
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:04,011
Rym: Like.

394
00:25:04,031 --> 00:25:06,038
Rym: yes, technically I can if I'm a mechanic.

395
00:25:06,199 --> 00:25:08,065
Scott: I'm going to replace your entire engine.

396
00:25:08,105 --> 00:25:09,169
Scott: Yeah, it's wonderful.

397
00:25:09,229 --> 00:25:18,729
Rym: Great Yeah, I guess it's just that a lot of people Expect computer people to be able to work miracles like their expectations are a lot higher than what the reality is.

398
00:25:19,472 --> 00:25:20,014
Scott: Yeah, yep.

399
00:25:20,054 --> 00:25:21,922
Scott: Yep, that's definitely what and also the other.

400
00:25:21,962 --> 00:25:23,930
Scott: the other problem is a lot of people.

401
00:25:24,653 --> 00:25:33,210
Scott: The problem I encountered the most is that even if someone has a fixable problem Is they cannot effectively communicate the problem and I'm pretty sure we did talk about this on a show before.

402
00:25:33,311 --> 00:25:34,039
Rym: I think we did so.

403
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:34,990
Rym: we don't need to go into detail.

404
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:42,350
Rym: But if someone messages me and says my Ubuntu broke my question is well, that's my answer is well that sucks.

405
00:25:42,892 --> 00:25:44,117
Rym: Yeah, fix it for me.

406
00:25:44,318 --> 00:25:51,888
Scott: I mean you have to be in order for me to accurately Figure out what exactly is wrong with your computer and exactly how to fix it.

407
00:25:52,249 --> 00:25:54,996
Scott: I need Incredibly detailed information.

408
00:25:55,177 --> 00:26:07,414
Scott: I mean I need to know like the exact like models and names of your hardware exactly how they're configured lots and lots of configuration options in your operating system and your software and What software you have installed.

409
00:26:07,475 --> 00:26:10,185
Scott: most people don't know these pieces of information.

410
00:26:10,245 --> 00:26:17,550
Scott: if they knew those pieces of information Then it's likely they'd be able to fix the problems themselves and they wouldn't need computer people because they be computer people.

411
00:26:17,691 --> 00:26:18,052
Scott: So

412
00:26:18,213 --> 00:26:36,969
Rym: this is this does present a very big problem in that How is someone who doesn't know about computers because not everyone knows about computers going to get their computer repaired Because they can't communicate the problem effectively and as a result anyone who knows how to fix it is not willing to spend the time It would take to diagnose the problem on their own.

413
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:37,713
Rym: You have to free.

414
00:26:37,813 --> 00:26:42,230
Scott: you pretty much have to go to one of those places where you pay someone you give them the computer.

415
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:43,349
Scott: So they can figure it out.

416
00:26:43,511 --> 00:26:51,052
Scott: you know because I can figure out the problem if I have hands-on access no matter what and Pay the money because it's not gonna be worth their time Otherwise,

417
00:26:51,454 --> 00:26:56,796
Rym: but even then there's also another problem where a lot of times people ask me how to do something with a computer Like how do I do this?

418
00:26:56,856 --> 00:26:59,230
Rym: or how can I make this worker like this was broken?

419
00:26:59,390 --> 00:26:59,973
Rym: How can I fix it?

420
00:27:00,475 --> 00:27:07,184
Rym: and I really don't know the answer like they'll ask things that like I just like something about Microsoft Word and I just I have no idea.

421
00:27:07,204 --> 00:27:08,690
Rym: I don't run into these problems.

422
00:27:08,951 --> 00:27:10,215
Rym: What's a good spyware remover?

423
00:27:10,255 --> 00:27:10,656
Rym: I don't know.

424
00:27:10,817 --> 00:27:12,562
Scott: None of them don't get spyware.

425
00:27:12,883 --> 00:27:14,167
Scott: That's the only answer.

426
00:27:14,227 --> 00:27:15,995
Scott: don't get spyware Don't be stupid.

427
00:27:16,337 --> 00:27:18,630
Scott: all spyware removers suck and are imperfect.

428
00:27:18,811 --> 00:27:23,410
Scott: So sure some might protect you once in a while, you know, but none of them are perfect.

429
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:27,230
Scott: None of them are like this universal panacea that will protect you from all spyware.

430
00:27:27,331 --> 00:27:30,330
Scott: But you see the only way to protect you from all spyware is to not be stupid.

431
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:32,920
Rym: But that's what I'm getting at a lot of people like they look at like us.

432
00:27:32,981 --> 00:27:35,370
Rym: like I I mean, I'm an IT professional.

433
00:27:35,551 --> 00:27:44,890
Rym: I have never every job I've ever had has been like enterprise IT support like crazy big companies and all this like Stuff that I don't even do this stuff at home.

434
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:46,896
Rym: Like I don't repair computer.

435
00:27:46,936 --> 00:27:48,441
Rym: like if a computer is a bad sick of RAM.

436
00:27:48,983 --> 00:27:51,009
Rym: I would just call some vendor to replace it.

437
00:27:51,049 --> 00:27:53,970
Rym: for me I wouldn't even think about opening the computer and fixing it myself.

438
00:27:54,412 --> 00:28:01,018
Rym: Yeah, and as a result if someone has a spyware problem or like my hard drive is dying I got to get the data off my aunt.

439
00:28:01,198 --> 00:28:05,915
Rym: my answer from just my work experience is well You should have had a raid five.

440
00:28:06,236 --> 00:28:08,625
Rym: just replace one of those 10,000 rpm scuzzies.

441
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:09,930
Rym: There's a pile of them in the back.

442
00:28:10,472 --> 00:28:11,977
Rym: Yeah, it's kind of like how.

443
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:13,462
Rym: here's a good analogy.

444
00:28:13,482 --> 00:28:23,914
Rym: a lot of times people say like oh People who use calculators in school will never like they won't be able to do the basic stuff anymore Or they'll be dumb about math I won't be able to add.

445
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:35,168
Rym: but at the same time having a calculator means you can attack Very difficult problems that might have otherwise been beyond human ability or beyond the time It would take for someone to calculate these things.

446
00:28:35,792 --> 00:28:43,015
Rym: But if someone does super high-level math, they might be bad at low-level math And they might not know anything about low-level math Do they not?

447
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:43,725
Rym: might not be able to?

448
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:47,510
Rym: Multiply two three digit numbers in their head quickly because they don't do that sort of thing.

449
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:52,679
Rym: They're busy working on much more difficult problems And in a way a lot of computer repairs.

450
00:28:52,740 --> 00:29:05,370
Rym: the same way like the people who are the most qualified to fix your computer Problems are the people who are working on problems that are so far beyond Anything that any person is gonna have in their house that it's kind of useless in the real world outside of businesses.

451
00:29:06,072 --> 00:29:07,155
Scott: And here's the other thing right?

452
00:29:07,757 --> 00:29:08,199
Scott: So okay.

453
00:29:08,219 --> 00:29:09,723
Scott: You have a problem with your computer.

454
00:29:10,285 --> 00:29:15,950
Scott: Let's say it's it's a tricky problem You know let you know it's something that's gonna require some knowledges to fix right?

455
00:29:16,453 --> 00:29:21,582
Scott: So you take it to the local computer place, you know And you're gonna pay someone whose job it is to fix it.

456
00:29:21,622 --> 00:29:23,148
Rym: to fix it right you do with your car.

457
00:29:23,288 --> 00:29:32,669
Rym: if my car Makes a weird noise I Can pretty much look and see if there's a potato in the exhaust pipe and then I can look under the hood and make sure nothing crawled up in there and died.

458
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:37,586
Rym: Beyond that I I gotta pay someone whatever they ask to fix it for me because I don't know.

459
00:29:37,606 --> 00:29:39,633
Scott: but now look at the world Of mechanics.

460
00:29:39,754 --> 00:29:43,210
Scott: right car mechanics because we keep using them because they're like the greatest analogy.

461
00:29:43,992 --> 00:29:54,665
Scott: There are mechanics of all shapes and sizes from everything from the guy who fixes cars at the local gas station To the guy who you know engineers for at Formula One, right?

462
00:29:54,706 --> 00:30:00,119
Scott: There's a there's a full range But there there is a large number of mechanics in the world.

463
00:30:00,239 --> 00:30:01,743
Scott: enough that demands.

464
00:30:01,763 --> 00:30:07,450
Scott: there's demand for mechanics with great skill and demand For mechanics with medium skill and demand for mechanics with low skill.

465
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:10,463
Rym: I mean to kind of put that into very sharp relief.

466
00:30:10,986 --> 00:30:11,910
Rym: My car is kind of old.

467
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:14,684
Rym: It's like a 98 Sunfire and it runs.

468
00:30:14,804 --> 00:30:19,850
Rym: Okay, barely I put a lot of miles on that thing and the front shocks are pretty much completely shot.

469
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:24,730
Rym: When it had some problems about a year ago, I I didn't want to spend money on it.

470
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:27,150
Rym: I pretty much just wanted the car to keep going barely.

471
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:33,230
Rym: So I found a crappy mechanic who didn't charge much and did just enough to make the car keep going.

472
00:30:33,571 --> 00:30:35,637
Scott: Yep, and there is also a supply.

473
00:30:35,778 --> 00:30:41,135
Scott: there's a supply and a demand of mechanics of all levels of skill With computers.

474
00:30:41,676 --> 00:30:46,090
Scott: there is a supply of high-level people and this supply of low-level people.

475
00:30:46,391 --> 00:31:08,862
Scott: But but this problem is there is a demand the demand is applied You're not quite match up and what ends up happening is you have this Demand of computer home computers that need fixing and the only people who are really qualified to really fix them are people who are getting paid a lot more money a year to do things like programming or Network engineering or something like that.

476
00:31:08,922 --> 00:31:16,066
Scott: and you know because you know They're doing much bigger things and they happen to know how to fix desktops because it's sort of a prerequisite knowledge.

477
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:27,249
Scott: and the people You know who are less skilled than them who are actually, you know, not Incredibly wealthy or incredibly gainfully employed in a fancy job that pays a lot of money a year.

478
00:31:28,214 --> 00:31:31,590
Scott: They don't might not have the skill to fix all the desktop.

479
00:31:31,791 --> 00:31:41,389
Scott: So there's very few people in the world who are In a position where they know enough to fix any desktop computer problem you may have or the most of them.

480
00:31:42,131 --> 00:31:50,458
Scott: But they somehow aren't able or don't want to get a big high-paying job to where fixing a desktop computer Would be a waste of their time.

481
00:31:50,478 --> 00:31:50,599
Rym: Yep.

482
00:31:50,699 --> 00:31:52,554
Rym: I mean think of this in most jobs I've had.

483
00:31:52,594 --> 00:31:52,735
Rym: like.

484
00:31:52,796 --> 00:31:57,202
Rym: I remember one time at one company I was working for my desktop computer like broke.

485
00:31:57,222 --> 00:31:58,949
Rym: it didn't boot and I'm sitting there.

486
00:31:59,250 --> 00:31:59,875
Rym: I'm trying to fix it.

487
00:31:59,895 --> 00:32:01,790
Rym: I'm like, alright looks like the Rams bad.

488
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:03,982
Rym: I'm gonna get this going and my boss comes in.

489
00:32:04,002 --> 00:32:04,705
Rym: It's like what are you doing?

490
00:32:04,766 --> 00:32:05,590
Rym: Like my computer broke?

491
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:06,135
Rym: I'm gonna fix it.

492
00:32:06,155 --> 00:32:07,430
Rym: He's like, what are you crazy?

493
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:10,409
Rym: We have people that are paid like a quarter what you're paid to do that for you.

494
00:32:10,691 --> 00:32:13,019
Rym: You go use some other computer and I'll call someone to fix this.

495
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:13,621
Scott: Mm-hmm.

496
00:32:13,922 --> 00:32:16,010
Rym: It's like it's not for companies.

497
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:19,806
Rym: It's not worth the money to even pay someone who works on high-level things.

498
00:32:19,846 --> 00:32:20,850
Rym: even look at a low-level thing.

499
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:24,009
Rym: They hire a low-level person and there aren't enough of those people.

500
00:32:24,712 --> 00:32:31,410
Scott: No, because I mean think about it if you know how to fix most problems with a desktop I think about that low-level person that your boss probably called.

501
00:32:31,771 --> 00:32:36,030
Scott: Probably took like twice as long to fix your computer as you would have might not have even you know.

502
00:32:36,171 --> 00:32:38,590
Scott: They probably just got it by fooling around or something.

503
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:42,975
Rym: Yeah I mean I could have fixed it as fast as I could have and As fast as I was working.

504
00:32:43,055 --> 00:32:46,790
Rym: it still wouldn't have been worth it to my employer for me to spend time working on that.

505
00:32:47,034 --> 00:32:47,910
Scott: It's worth it more.

506
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:49,538
Scott: It's worth more to them to have Rym.

507
00:32:49,558 --> 00:32:59,135
Scott: keep doing this fancy thing and have someone Take twice or three times as long to fix his desktop computer who doesn't know as much as Rym does And that's just in a company.

508
00:32:59,396 --> 00:33:00,399
Rym: What about home people?

509
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,764
Rym: I mean you're no.

510
00:33:01,804 --> 00:33:14,490
Rym: your home user is willing to pay 40 50 60 90 dollars a half hour to have some high-powered enterprise IT guy Come and fix their computer for him, but there's no one else who's qualified to do it.

511
00:33:14,671 --> 00:33:17,490
Scott: It's sort of like the only person who's qualified to solve.

512
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:29,550
Scott: Imagine if it's like if everyone was driving f1 cars and the only people qualified to fix them were these f1 Mechanics and there weren't so many of them and they were all working for formula one getting paid hundreds of millions of dollars.

513
00:33:30,192 --> 00:33:32,800
Scott: So what are all these normal people who have f1 cars?

514
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:35,649
Scott: What are they gonna do when their f1 cars break their SOL?

515
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:44,490
Scott: Yeah, they can have someone who's kind of crappy try to fix it and do a shitty job for a little bit of money But that's never gonna be a perfect solution.

516
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:56,189
Scott: You're gonna have to just give up eventually and this is why I think we're seeing a lot of people like when they get spy we're on the computer they just throw it out and buy a new one and Computers are kind of cheap.

517
00:33:56,310 --> 00:34:02,289
Scott: It's almost not a bad idea as long as you know Someone smart can rescue that computer from the trash because nothing wrong with it.

518
00:34:02,611 --> 00:34:04,779
Rym: Yep, of course the easier way instead of throwing it out.

519
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:11,147
Rym: Just convince it like go to someone say yeah for a hundred bucks I'll fix your computer and then just you know reinstall windows and give it back to them.

520
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:17,857
Scott: Yep That's the problem though is you know the solution like fixing your car right is if your car breaks What's the solution?

521
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,188
Scott: get it to drive again?

522
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,112
Scott: It's not like.

523
00:34:20,674 --> 00:34:24,289
Scott: it's not like you'll ever have a problem where I get your car to drive again.

524
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:34,610
Scott: But now your air conditioning is broke, you know, you have to choose one of the other but with your computer Sometimes it can happen where well I can get your computer to work again, but you're gonna lose all your word documents.

525
00:34:35,512 --> 00:34:36,690
Scott: That's the only you know.

526
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:41,766
Scott: It's a choice you're gonna have to make and that sort of compromise is sort of like, uh, it's all.

527
00:34:41,867 --> 00:34:42,750
Scott: it's like you're screwed.

528
00:34:42,911 --> 00:34:48,750
Scott: There's a point at which you're just sol that there's nothing you can do to get it to be perfect.

529
00:34:48,851 --> 00:34:50,161
Scott: There's no perfect fix.

530
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:51,330
Scott: It's not possible.

531
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:57,268
Scott: It's not worth anyone's time money or effort to implement a perfect fix if it is positive.

532
00:34:57,289 --> 00:35:09,090
Rym: a lot of people I think we said this before so I'm not gonna dwell on it But a lot of people they think about their car and they kind of owning a car The cost of periodic repairs and oil change and maintenance and all those things.

533
00:35:09,573 --> 00:35:18,030
Rym: It's kind of assumed like they know they got to take it to get an oil change periodically They gotta pay someone to do it, but they take some they take it to get an oil change and they pay someone else.

534
00:35:18,171 --> 00:35:19,396
Rym: Oh, no, that's what I'm saying.

535
00:35:19,436 --> 00:35:22,350
Rym: But when it comes to computers people don't have the same perception.

536
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:30,590
Rym: They buy a computer and they don't think about the fact that someone has to you know Effectively change the oil periodically and do routine maintenance on it.

537
00:35:30,751 --> 00:35:34,150
Scott: You don't really need to change the oil so much you just need to not screw it up.

538
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:36,035
Scott: It's it's like it's.

539
00:35:36,255 --> 00:35:46,270
Scott: it's like a car just in its natural use even if you drive it nicely and carefully and you're good To it, you know and you you warm it up and you know, you're you drive very nicely.

540
00:35:46,472 --> 00:35:51,860
Scott: You don't need to warm up modern car No But it's gonna need an oil change just because of wear and tear.

541
00:35:51,880 --> 00:36:06,970
Scott: a computer doesn't get worn and torn unless you Specifically do things with the computer that you know break down the system like installing shitty software or Configuring something poor or even little things like not organizing your files.

542
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:08,155
Rym: I mean I would say that's kind of.

543
00:36:08,658 --> 00:36:14,090
Rym: the difference is that computers require a lot of Proactive maintenance as opposed to reactive maintenance like on a car.

544
00:36:14,411 --> 00:36:18,810
Scott: I don't really consider it proactive maintenance more as not smashing it with a hammer.

545
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:29,050
Rym: You have to really just kind of be careful, but that's only if you know if you don't know I mean when I got my first computer 486 I broke that thing on a daily basis, but there was no one to fix it for me.

546
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:31,109
Rym: So I fixed it myself and I got to fix it.

547
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:34,161
Scott: Well, that's sort of a take the clock apart and put it back together.

548
00:36:34,222 --> 00:36:35,787
Scott: method of learning more than a.

549
00:36:35,808 --> 00:36:45,136
Rym: yeah You know breaking by breaking by accident I mean I hate to say it but I think I do actually have a solution to this whole problem and I think just Society is changing rapidly.

550
00:36:45,156 --> 00:36:54,510
Rym: I mean the the computers and the internet I think are going to be as I think they already have had as much of an effect as the Industrial Revolution and it's only getting faster.

551
00:36:55,651 --> 00:37:00,326
Rym: Not like maybe this last generation will be the last one but starting with the next generation.

552
00:37:00,366 --> 00:37:13,401
Rym: like people who are kids today I just being computer illiterate or not having just the most basic of computer skills is going to be the same as being Completely illiterate in the mind the future world you I think society

553
00:37:13,461 --> 00:37:25,335
Scott: think about right now what it's like for a person who can't read Or write to live and not reader, you know not read or write any specific language, you know Spanish and something that

554
00:37:25,555 --> 00:37:26,117
Rym: we're talking about.

555
00:37:26,258 --> 00:37:29,770
Rym: or when I started my new job and I'm all pop Python and they're all pearl.

556
00:37:29,971 --> 00:37:34,850
Scott: Yeah, but I'm talking about someone who cannot read or write any language.

557
00:37:35,272 --> 00:37:37,784
Scott: Think about what their life is like and how hard it is.

558
00:37:37,885 --> 00:37:38,890
Scott: They can't get a job.

559
00:37:39,212 --> 00:37:41,570
Scott: They can't even like do work at McDonald's, right?

560
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:43,335
Scott: It's they basically are.

561
00:37:43,395 --> 00:37:48,090
Scott: they're incapable of functioning within society above like the lowest levels.

562
00:37:48,971 --> 00:37:51,545
Scott: That's what it's gonna be like for someone who doesn't know how to you.

563
00:37:51,645 --> 00:37:57,170
Scott: in a few years Someone who doesn't know how to use a computer is gonna have that same trouble.

564
00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:03,570
Scott: They're not gonna be able to do anything or interact with society Above the lowest levels and I can be able to get any job.

565
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:06,883
Scott: They're not gonna be able to do anything meaningful or nothing.

566
00:38:06,903 --> 00:38:08,610
Scott: They do will be worthwhile.

567
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:20,350
Scott: They'll be a useless person that won't be able to do anything productive won't be able to earn money won't be able to Conduct business in any way until they learn and it's it's gonna suck for those people.

568
00:38:21,351 --> 00:38:28,715
Rym: And I think in the end this problem is only gonna solve itself just by the general public having a basic Understanding of how computers work.

569
00:38:29,277 --> 00:38:33,730
Scott: Yeah, I mean that's the one thing with cars is because of the way cars are.

570
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:37,470
Scott: I mean you do need a car at least in the US, you know in most parts of it.

571
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:45,220
Scott: Anyway outside of you know, incredibly densely populated urban areas where there is public transportation Yeah, even though there should be more public transportation.

572
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,505
Rym: That's a separate show.

573
00:38:46,525 --> 00:38:47,288
Rym: Yeah, we should do man.

574
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:49,197
Scott: We are the separate show show.

575
00:38:49,257 --> 00:38:50,644
Rym: talk about Roger Rabbit.

576
00:38:50,885 --> 00:38:51,829
Rym: Yep, and cloverly.

577
00:38:53,334 --> 00:38:59,582
Scott: But yeah, you know you need a car But you don't need to know how to take care of a car.

578
00:38:59,622 --> 00:39:06,586
Rym: because you set up this sort of infrastructure Cars, I mean, I think the only the analogy can kind of work.

579
00:39:06,767 --> 00:39:15,410
Scott: There is no Imaginable infrastructure we can set up around personal computers to where people wouldn't have to know anything about them.

580
00:39:15,732 --> 00:39:22,782
Rym: I think we could if there were just a Slightly higher basic understanding like the way computers are now would be.

581
00:39:22,882 --> 00:39:27,888
Rym: imagine if now I mean people know how to drive cars Generally before they were allowed to drive cars.

582
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:46,930
Rym: imagine if like the average person didn't know you had to get oil changes and didn't know that you had to use a turn signal and it never heard of a headlight and didn't realize that you have to Close the door to the car after you get into it when before you start driving Mmm, and you know people just driving backwards cuz like their mom did it that way and they don't know better.

583
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:48,176
Rym: so they do it that way too.

584
00:39:48,276 --> 00:39:51,109
Rym: and that's what the computer world is like now.

585
00:39:51,250 --> 00:40:01,189
Rym: and Computer repairmen have to deal with that sort of thing the same way that mechanics would have to deal with no one in America knowing That they have to change their oil and engine seizing up.

586
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:08,759
Scott: You know mechanics do sometimes have to deal with that level of stupidity, but not as often but not very often You know, the valve lean is always crowded.

587
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,970
Scott: people are getting their instant oil changes, you know.

588
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:13,778
Scott: But computers you got this.

589
00:40:13,919 --> 00:40:16,446
Scott: you still have people putting their coffee cups in the CD room.

590
00:40:16,988 --> 00:40:17,670
Scott: It still happens.

591
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,148
Scott: It's pretty sad.

592
00:40:19,671 --> 00:40:29,690
Rym: But I mean at the same time look at it this way and right now if you know a little bit about cars You can save a lot of money on car repairs by knowing a little bit.

593
00:40:30,112 --> 00:40:35,578
Rym: Like if I go to a mechanic and say cars making a funny noise That's gonna cost me a lot of money to get fixed.

594
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:41,219
Rym: if I go in and say the cars making a funny noise I think it's because my distributor coil is cracked.

595
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,267
Rym: Look I sprayed some water on it in the car stalled.

596
00:40:43,287 --> 00:40:43,909
Rym: I think that's it.

597
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,409
Rym: It's gonna cost me very little to get that fixed.

598
00:40:48,551 --> 00:40:54,496
Scott: Or even if it doesn't cost you any less to get it fixed it'll get fixed a lot sooner All right.

599
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:55,870
Rym: I think we've ran it about that enough.

600
00:40:55,931 --> 00:40:59,770
Rym: I hope we didn't do a show about this in the past But I don't think we'll need to do one again in the near future.

601
00:41:00,151 --> 00:41:01,735
Scott: No, it just keeps coming up lately.

602
00:41:01,816 --> 00:41:19,821
Scott: cuz you know, there's more and more people, you know asking at least lately like hey fix You know, I guess happens in the holiday season when families get together and you know people like there's a lot more people going home To their families and then they their family computer has a problem and they they ask someone they know Hey my fan, you know, I'm at my mom's house.

603
00:41:19,902 --> 00:41:20,606
Scott: Whatever lately.

604
00:41:20,626 --> 00:41:26,069
Rym: My answer has been Which if I were a dentist, would you ask me to operate on your tooth right now?

605
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:35,230
Scott: Yeah, my uncle's a dentist and you know sometimes, you know, people don't ask him to operate on the tooth right now But they'll say, you know, hey, I've been having a whatever whatever and he said, you know what?

606
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:37,218
Scott: He always says make an appointment appointment.

607
00:41:37,358 --> 00:41:38,101
Scott: I'll take a look at.

608
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:40,270
Rym: I would however trade services.

609
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:45,590
Rym: I mean if I knew a mechanic and it was like I'll fix your computer you fix my car.

610
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,717
Scott: I'm happy to fix someone's computer.

611
00:41:47,737 --> 00:41:49,724
Scott: the problem, you know, the problems are when they.

612
00:41:49,844 --> 00:41:51,550
Rym: well, the problem is opportunity cost.

613
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:53,054
Scott: Yeah opportunity cost.

614
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:54,679
Scott: and can I actually fix it?

615
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,745
Scott: and how long is it gonna take?

616
00:41:56,806 --> 00:41:58,090
Scott: and am I just you know?

617
00:41:58,851 --> 00:42:03,506
Scott: If it's gonna take if it's possible see if a problem it's possible to fix perfectly and I'll.

618
00:42:03,526 --> 00:42:04,610
Scott: that'll take six hours.

619
00:42:05,032 --> 00:42:06,681
Scott: Reinstalling Windows takes one hour.

620

Scott: installing Ubuntu takes 30 minutes.

621
00:42:08,832 --> 00:42:13,148
Scott: I'm not gonna spend the five hours, even though it's possible find someone else forget it.

622
00:42:13,188 --> 00:42:13,750
