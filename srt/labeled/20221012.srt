1
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:09,488
Rym: It's Wednesday, October 12th, 2022.

2
00:00:09,488 --> 00:00:09,689
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,723 --> 00:00:13,176
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,621 --> 00:00:15,160
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight.

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,920
Rym: We're talking about two shows that only one of us watched.

6
00:00:18,242 --> 00:00:18,919
Rym: I guess movies.

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,560
Rym: The Newish Gundam, Kookaroo's Doan's Island, and Star Trek Prodigy.

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,540
Scott: I didn't realize the Star Trek one was a movie.

9
00:00:29,141 --> 00:00:29,959
Rym: It's not a Stevie show.

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:30,764
Scott: Oh.

11
00:00:32,861 --> 00:00:33,878
Scott: Let's do this.

12
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:40,940
Scott: So if you listened to our last GeekNights episode, I talked about the car that appeared under mysterious circumstances.

13
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,218
Rym: I'm really invested in this.

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,080
Scott: That was on Friday night.

15
00:00:44,561 --> 00:00:51,319
Scott: It is currently Wednesday evening dusk-ish, and the car is still there.

16
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,280
Scott: So it's Friday night, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.

17
00:00:55,962 --> 00:00:56,718
Scott: Car's still there.

18
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:57,678
Rym: It's kind of amazing.

19
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:02,100
Rym: Now it was a holiday weekend, but it is no longer a holiday.

20
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,919
Rym: It's like regular work time now.

21
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:04,791
Scott: Yeah.

22
00:01:05,282 --> 00:01:09,740
Scott: So it's like on the one hand, I just want to wait it out and see what happens and not interfere, right?

23
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,980
Scott: But on the other hand, I just really want to tell somebody.

24
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:16,520
Scott: Not it's like I don't want to tell, you know, the authorities.

25
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,597
Scott: It's like that's right.

26
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,380
Scott: It's not my business, but I just like I want to find someone who gives it.

27
00:01:21,721 --> 00:01:29,880
Rym: I feel like what this warrants is you make a Reddit post in the Astoria Reddit be like, so what's up with this car?

28
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,367
Rym: Yeah, what's with this car?

29
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:33,720
Rym: would be a pretty good headline for that post.

30
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,079
Rym: Like, what's the deal with this car?

31
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,499
Scott: I don't know if anyone else will care, but I don't know.

32
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,400
Rym: I feel like that's the kind of thing that would get a very niche audience.

33
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:42,899
Rym: that could slowly grow a little bit.

34
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,300
Rym: Depends on how long this lasts.

35
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:48,560
Rym: If that car is still there a month from now, suddenly this becomes legendary.

36
00:01:49,322 --> 00:01:51,139
Scott: Yeah, I guess I could do the mystery of the car.

37
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,480
Rym: Yeah, you got to go down and put some chalk on the wheel and the road.

38
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:59,139
Rym: So you'll know if it moved, because what if someone moved it and parked it again in the weird angle?

39
00:01:59,763 --> 00:02:00,840
Scott: Does that's not going to happen?

40
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,740
Scott: I don't think they could.

41
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,233
Rym: You don't know.

42
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,679
Scott: Could be it could be a tow truck is going to move that car.

43
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:14,979
Rym: So speaking of which, my car, you know, the one that we use basically just to go to places that you can't get without a car.

44
00:02:15,742 --> 00:02:21,360
Rym: If you live in New York City, like ski mountains and hiking places, I was able to get it out.

45
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,780
Rym: I haven't used this car in months because I don't drive this car often.

46
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,518
Rym: Like I pay a lot to keep this car just to use during the winter and like hiking season.

47
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,300
Rym: And I had something happen to me I've never had happen in my entire life.

48
00:02:33,703 --> 00:02:35,660
Rym: I had gas go stale.

49
00:02:37,021 --> 00:02:38,779
Scott: What even happens if that happens?

50
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,919
Rym: So if you wait long enough, it just won't work.

51
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,880
Rym: Like gasoline actually just stops working.

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,480
Rym: It goes stale and as a shelf life, just like anything else.

53
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,280
Rym: Most people will never encounter this because they use their cars.

54
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,520
Scott: Do you just like siphon all the gas out and pump new gas in?

55
00:02:53,162 --> 00:02:55,180
Rym: Yeah, that's pretty much what you have to do if it gets bad.

56
00:02:55,281 --> 00:02:56,459
Rym: But it's not that stale.

57
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,358
Scott: What do you do to dispose of the bad gas?

58
00:02:59,863 --> 00:03:03,040
Rym: Uh, dispose of it the same way you dispose of other harmful volatiles.

59
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,840
Scott: I'm going to have to Google this to learn the chemistry.

60
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:06,361
Rym: Yep.

61
00:03:06,441 --> 00:03:17,760
Rym: So basically, in this case, I didn't have to do anything because I went to get the car to check it out, you know, drive it around a little bit, which you got to do periodically, which the Russian military seems to have not done with all its cars.

62
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,239
Rym: And check engine light came on and I was like, oh.

63
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:27,660
Rym: So I drove to like the auto zone to get the codes pulled because I don't own a thing that'll get the codes out of my car.

64
00:03:28,123 --> 00:03:29,540
Rym: And it says the engine's running lean.

65
00:03:30,124 --> 00:03:36,400
Rym: And that actually made sense because there is like an eighth of a tank of gas and that car hasn't moved in a couple of months.

66
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:39,680
Rym: So that's about the point where the gas would start to go stale.

67
00:03:40,102 --> 00:03:47,420
Rym: So all I had to do was fill the tank and it's fine because I can dilute that little bit of stale gas with a whole bunch of good gas.

68
00:03:48,182 --> 00:03:54,637
Rym: And I'll be driving the car enough with the hiking coming up and apple pick in and all that nonsense to picking.

69
00:03:54,657 --> 00:03:55,180
Scott: time is over.

70
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,960
Rym: There's a little bit of apple picking left.

71
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:01,300
Rym: There's like two more weeks of some apples, just not the varieties that people tend to be excited about.

72
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,760
Scott: Hardly any varieties.

73
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,700
Rym: Plus, I don't eat that many apples.

74
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:08,840
Rym: Like I can't eat the number of apples that I would actually pick apple picking.

75
00:04:09,241 --> 00:04:15,339
Rym: I go to apple picking to hang out in an orchard to eat cider donuts, to drink cider and to go home.

76
00:04:16,503 --> 00:04:18,320
Scott: Well, anyway, anyway.

77
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,560
Rym: So in the news, there is actually a ton of news going on in the animation space.

78
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:29,845
Rym: But the most important thing that came up very recently is one.

79
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:36,460
Rym: not that long ago, like 10 days ago, Cartoon Network celebrated its 30th anniversary.

80
00:04:37,784 --> 00:04:39,020
Rym: Yep, which is pretty notable.

81
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,064
Rym: Cartoon Network launched on October 1st in 1992.

82
00:04:43,064 --> 00:04:44,460
Rym: Took a little while for it to get going.

83
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:54,179
Scott: And I'll link to an article that kind of talks a big deal for, you know, even when we didn't have cable, right, us 10 year old cartoon watchers who only had Nickelodeon and Saturday morning cartoons.

84
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,859
Scott: Cartoon Network coming into existence is a big deal.

85
00:04:57,102 --> 00:04:58,759
Scott: And I was you know, we did an episode on it.

86
00:04:58,981 --> 00:05:04,720
Scott: I was very excited when I was finally able to watch it or when I could see it at other people's houses or whatever.

87
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:05,280
Rym: Right.

88
00:05:06,163 --> 00:05:15,440
Rym: So the news today and there's a big Internet discourse about this where like a third of people talking about it are acting like it's the end of the world.

89
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,180
Rym: Another third of them are trying to downplay it and saying it's not as bad as people are saying.

90
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,260
Rym: You're all just fear mongering.

91
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,919
Rym: And another third of them have no idea what the fuck's going on.

92
00:05:24,522 --> 00:05:29,560
Rym: So the best way I can summarize this is this is not just Cartoon Network.

93
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:39,900
Rym: Cartoon Network and what's happening with them and Warner Brothers is like one tiny piece of the broader puzzle, and it's the same puzzle we've been talking about on GeekNights for as long as there's been GeekNights.

94
00:05:40,782 --> 00:05:43,920
Rym: All media is consolidating into one giant company.

95
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,480
Rym: It's just happening very slowly, but it's happening and it's accelerating.

96
00:05:48,022 --> 00:05:52,100
Rym: And this is the kind of thing that happens when media consolidates.

97
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:57,821
Rym: So all the Cartoon Network regulation, all the Cartoon Network stuff seems to be being good.

98
00:05:58,082 --> 00:06:02,400
Rym: It's getting merged into like the generic Warner Brothers pipeline.

99
00:06:03,002 --> 00:06:06,820
Rym: And Warner Brothers is shutting down tons of stuff and consolidating.

100
00:06:07,162 --> 00:06:08,440
Rym: And there's all sorts of nonsense.

101
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,160
Scott: Well, Warner Brothers is like an interesting situation, right?

102
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:16,877
Scott: Because Warner Brothers discovery was up until recently part of AT&T.

103
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,340
Rym: Yeah, which is already weird and probably should be illegal.

104
00:06:21,442 --> 00:06:22,074
Rym: But I digress.

105
00:06:22,176 --> 00:06:22,339
Rym: Right.

106
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,161
Scott: Sure.

107
00:06:23,381 --> 00:06:31,440
Scott: But, you know, because of situation, I happen to have a small amount of AT&T stock despite them being evil or whatever.

108
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,348
Scott: Had some.

109
00:06:32,655 --> 00:06:32,900
Scott: Right.

110
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:41,007
Scott: And I noticed one day I randomly logged into the E-Trade and I saw that it's like there was a new symbol.

111
00:06:41,148 --> 00:06:42,720
Scott: I think I told the story on the show before.

112
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:48,700
Scott: A new symbol had appeared in my portfolio and I had not made any trades.

113
00:06:48,882 --> 00:06:50,059
Scott: And I was like, what the fuck is that?

114
00:06:50,281 --> 00:06:53,040
Scott: Did someone break into my account, even though it's got all the security on it?

115
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:53,683
Scott: What's the deal?

116
00:06:54,567 --> 00:06:57,602
Scott: And it turns out that I just, you know, wasn't paying enough attention.

117
00:06:58,726 --> 00:07:01,837
Scott: And they split off Warner Brothers discovery from AT&T.

118
00:07:03,181 --> 00:07:12,303
Scott: So everyone who had AT&T stock just got free shares effectively of WBD, right, as it split off.

119
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:15,255
Scott: And, you know, there's reasons.

120
00:07:15,296 --> 00:07:16,280
Scott: they say they did this.

121
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,579
Scott: And I'm sure there's real reasons that are not said.

122
00:07:18,882 --> 00:07:19,165
Scott: Right.

123
00:07:19,447 --> 00:07:20,800
Scott: But it's a thing that happened.

124
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:30,560
Scott: But then, of course, since then, Warner Brothers Discovery operating as its own deal has, you know, kept coming back in the news, doing various things.

125
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:30,981
Rym: Yep.

126
00:07:31,001 --> 00:07:34,800
Rym: Warner Brothers Discovery has canceled tons of projects.

127
00:07:35,103 --> 00:07:36,780
Rym: There's been all sorts of shenanigans.

128
00:07:37,603 --> 00:07:39,140
Rym: There's a lot you can go read online.

129
00:07:39,221 --> 00:07:40,699
Rym: I'm not even going to try to summarize it all.

130
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:41,542
Scott: Yeah.

131
00:07:41,602 --> 00:07:46,328
Scott: But if you if you look at the stock price, basically what happened is WBD split off from AT&T, right.

132
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:52,660
Scott: And then it basically WBD from that point, it just went down.

133
00:07:53,980 --> 00:08:00,019
Scott: Everyone who had it and was paying attention just like sold it as soon as they got it, which is what I should have done.

134
00:08:00,986 --> 00:08:01,838
Scott: But I didn't know.

135
00:08:02,803 --> 00:08:04,540
Rym: Nothing we're saying is financial advice.

136
00:08:04,601 --> 00:08:06,340
Rym: We're not giving you any investment advice.

137
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,164
Scott: No, I'm just saying.

138
00:08:07,305 --> 00:08:09,560
Scott: I'm just saying this is what had no advice.

139
00:08:09,681 --> 00:08:11,499
Scott: This is just a tale of what happened.

140
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,140
Scott: This is what has what has occurred.

141
00:08:14,381 --> 00:08:19,199
Rym: You know, that's actually a line that I use a lot ever since we watched that video that I made a thing of the day about the monkey.

142
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,180
Rym: It's like I'm not saying this is a good thing that happened.

143
00:08:22,643 --> 00:08:24,460
Rym: I am simply saying that it happened.

144
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,599
Scott: This is what has happened.

145
00:08:27,483 --> 00:08:29,060
Scott: There was a split of some kind.

146
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,951
Scott: The stock price went down and then all these news is keep happening about them doing things.

147
00:08:35,094 --> 00:08:35,379
Scott: Yeah.

148
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:47,000
Rym: So Warner Brothers TV group chairman Channing Dungy sent an email or a memo to employees announcing eighty two layoffs and forty three.

149
00:08:47,162 --> 00:08:47,749
Scott: eighty two.

150
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:48,498
Scott: That's no big deal.

151
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,001
Scott: Yeah.

152
00:08:49,041 --> 00:09:00,780
Rym: Well, and forty three additional vacant positions that will no longer be filled, which actually represents a twenty six percent reduction in their scripted, unscripted and animated divisions combined.

153
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,679
Rym: Twenty six percent is a pretty big number.

154
00:09:04,361 --> 00:09:04,602
Scott: Oh yeah.

155
00:09:04,622 --> 00:09:07,840
Scott: I mean, it's not a big place, so it's like percentage wise, it's a big number.

156
00:09:07,941 --> 00:09:11,020
Scott: But like the news came out today, the Intel is laying off thousands of people.

157
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:11,502
Rym: Yeah.

158
00:09:11,542 --> 00:09:13,340
Rym: So it's like, but what is that percentage?

159
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,920
Rym: The whole the whole I mean, capitalism is a failure.

160
00:09:16,061 --> 00:09:17,780
Rym: That's really the underlying story here.

161
00:09:18,221 --> 00:09:26,599
Rym: I'd say a third of all night's news is are actually just us saying capitalism is an egregious failure to humanity in various different ways.

162
00:09:27,501 --> 00:09:27,802
Scott: Yes.

163
00:09:28,725 --> 00:09:34,446
Rym: But they also announced that they're canceling a bunch of their incubator programs for new talent.

164
00:09:34,486 --> 00:09:36,400
Rym: So Stage 13 is going away.

165
00:09:36,501 --> 00:09:38,460
Rym: The Warner Brothers Writers Workshop is going away.

166
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,840
Rym: The Warner Brothers Directors Workshop is going away.

167
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:52,220
Rym: I've seen a lot of non white creators pointing out that some of these places are where a lot of non white, non wealthy people get their start in this industry.

168
00:09:53,963 --> 00:09:56,920
Rym: So this is one of a series of cataclysms.

169
00:09:57,921 --> 00:10:05,559
Rym: I feel like the entire entertainment industry, like like broadly globally, is barreling toward bad outcomes.

170
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,219
Rym: But animation seems to be bearing a particular brunt on it right now.

171
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,207
Scott: Well, I mean, this is what we taught.

172
00:10:11,227 --> 00:10:14,859
Scott: We've been talking about this since, like, you know, the Napster days.

173
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:19,682
Scott: I was like, hey, you know, and you know, it's like in the days like Creative Commons is a new thing.

174
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:26,460
Scott: It's like, hey, we have the Internet now, which means that artists no longer are gated from distributing their works to the world.

175
00:10:26,781 --> 00:10:26,982
Scott: Right.

176
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:28,691
Scott: You don't need to, you know, make.

177
00:10:28,731 --> 00:10:30,218
Scott: you can make a movie like we used to.

178
00:10:30,258 --> 00:10:35,271
Scott: if you made a movie by yourself in the 80s or 90s, it was on a VHS tape that only you and your friends would ever see.

179
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:35,555
Scott: Right.

180
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,063
Scott: And now there's YouTube.

181
00:10:37,364 --> 00:10:42,740
Scott: So it's like, you know, when we were kids, we were watching the Saturday morning cartoons.

182
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:48,000
Scott: So those cartoons made money because they were covered in advertisements on Saturday morning with lots of viewers.

183
00:10:48,261 --> 00:10:48,482
Scott: Right.

184
00:10:48,924 --> 00:10:52,400
Scott: And then we watched cable cartoons, which is the same thing, basically.

185
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,344
Scott: Right.

186
00:10:54,846 --> 00:11:00,982
Scott: But it's like now the kids watch the TikToks and the YouTube, which make some monies.

187
00:11:01,304 --> 00:11:01,525
Scott: Right.

188
00:11:01,826 --> 00:11:05,433
Scott: But they don't make the mega Hollywood monies that a Saturday morning cartoon could make.

189
00:11:05,596 --> 00:11:05,880
Scott: Right.

190
00:11:06,901 --> 00:11:13,826
Scott: And it's like the mega cartoons, you know, like a big, big, real professionally made show, like a fucking adventure.

191
00:11:13,846 --> 00:11:16,360
Scott: time costs a lot of money to make.

192
00:11:17,401 --> 00:11:18,044
Scott: But is it going to?

193
00:11:18,064 --> 00:11:21,783
Scott: how much money is it going to make when you air it or sell it or whatever?

194
00:11:21,803 --> 00:11:22,813
Rym: What's the opportunity back?

195
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,941
Rym: What's the opportunity cost compared to taking that money and putting it in the stock market?

196
00:11:28,703 --> 00:11:28,903
Scott: Right.

197
00:11:28,923 --> 00:11:29,164
Scott: It's like.

198
00:11:29,726 --> 00:11:38,580
Scott: it's like so and that same story can be told for all sorts of different forms of video and audio entertainment.

199
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,500
Rym: I think there's something even more in music.

200
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:45,442
Scott: It's got hit first because the production costs of music are lower, though not always low.

201
00:11:45,844 --> 00:11:49,240
Scott: And the distribution costs, especially bandwidth, were much lower.

202
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:49,823
Scott: Right.

203
00:11:49,984 --> 00:11:52,639
Scott: It's like, you know, the music thing happened first.

204
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,042
Rym: Yeah.

205
00:11:53,103 --> 00:11:54,360
Rym: But look what also happened there.

206
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:58,282
Rym: The same thing that drove reality TV and the same thing that's driving a lot of TV changes.

207
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:03,122
Rym: Now, a lot of people don't care that much about what they listen to or what they watch to.

208
00:12:03,162 --> 00:12:03,665
Rym: They just want.

209
00:12:03,705 --> 00:12:10,870
Rym: they want something like imagine the kind of person who would just turn on the TV and flip through the nerds who were like really caring about the something.

210
00:12:10,993 --> 00:12:11,239
Scott: Yeah.

211
00:12:11,941 --> 00:12:20,539
Rym: So I think there's something sort of subtle and slightly insidious going on underpinning all of this, because one thing we predicted that we were I still think we're right about.

212
00:12:21,061 --> 00:12:33,940
Rym: But technology trends have actually sort of staved off one of the outcomes advertising still remains, I believe, very strongly, largely a scam perpetrated on almost everyone involved in the ecosystem.

213
00:12:34,741 --> 00:12:46,660
Rym: But advertising has been the way that most media gets funded, like in America, for most of the history of media in the modern world, like since the advent of radio and television and even newspapers to a big degree.

214
00:12:47,621 --> 00:12:54,592
Rym: So all that said, as that ecosystem gets exposed and collapses, you'd think, well, that revenue dries up and media collapses.

215
00:12:54,934 --> 00:12:55,820
Rym: and that is happening.

216
00:12:56,321 --> 00:13:03,407
Rym: But because also the technology trend is most people do not have a general purpose computer anymore.

217
00:13:03,729 --> 00:13:05,139
Rym: They're using things like tick tock.

218
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:13,043
Rym: They're being pushed into appliances and gated applications where they can't avoid advertising.

219
00:13:13,986 --> 00:13:29,003
Rym: So the media that makes the most money will increasingly be the media that is in those gated ecosystems where advertising is unavoidable, thus propping up the perceived value of advertising and delaying the inevitable destruction of the entire ecosystem.

220
00:13:29,845 --> 00:13:40,605
Scott: I think something else that has happened, at least especially in sports entertainment, but also in others, is that there are new ad buyers that have appeared and other ad buyers

221
00:13:40,967 --> 00:13:47,118
Rym: like crypto bullshit was a flash in the pan of ad buying, but they bought a lot of ads before NFTs collapsed.

222
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,880
Scott: You know, while gambling is a huge sports, gambling is a huge ad buyer.

223
00:13:52,181 --> 00:13:52,442
Scott: Right.

224
00:13:52,483 --> 00:13:56,360
Scott: So it's like there are new people who are buying ads.

225
00:13:56,761 --> 00:13:57,063
Scott: Right.

226
00:13:57,163 --> 00:14:08,860
Scott: It's like, you know, other people, you know, a lot of people other than like cars and pharmaceutical drugs and certain things like that, you know, sort of large and, you know, I guess, you know, soft drinks or whatever.

227
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:11,358
Scott: It's like a lot of ad buyers washed up.

228
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:12,629
Scott: Right.

229
00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:13,359
Scott: Or they left.

230
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:18,882
Scott: They stopped buying ads on television and started buying, you know, targeted Internet ads.

231
00:14:19,946 --> 00:14:24,002
Rym: And there was this brief era where most people use the Internet also knew how to block ads.

232
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:29,005
Rym: But now most people use the Internet, only have a phone and have no understand.

233
00:14:29,025 --> 00:14:31,040
Rym: They don't even know that blocking ads is a possibility.

234
00:14:32,941 --> 00:14:33,303
Scott: Man.

235
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:35,899
Rym: Yeah, it's it's all going to be rough.

236
00:14:36,924 --> 00:14:42,640
Scott: And in terms of in terms of cartoons, it's like we're only going to get to watch cartoons if someone can make money making cartoons.

237
00:14:42,962 --> 00:14:46,740
Scott: And it's very hard to make money making cartoons right now.

238
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,307
Rym: Never mind the fact that companies can mind their back catalogs forever with almost no incremental cost.

239
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,799
Rym: And it's just free money for them.

240
00:14:54,301 --> 00:15:04,620
Rym: And even as consumers, if no anime were ever made again from this point forward, I sadly would still in my entire life not run out of anime.

241
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,659
Rym: I kind of want to watch.

242
00:15:06,661 --> 00:15:09,640
Rym: Yeah, I mean, I don't watch most of the anime that comes out.

243
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:14,445
Rym: I think there's some we're going to talk about some anime in a moment that I really want to watch.

244
00:15:14,506 --> 00:15:15,779
Rym: And I just haven't had time to watch yet.

245
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,839
Scott: I mean, even a very long time ago, centuries ago, right.

246
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:25,040
Scott: Renaissance times, there was still already more music books.

247
00:15:25,364 --> 00:15:25,527
Scott: Right.

248
00:15:25,567 --> 00:15:26,399
Scott: I didn't have movies.

249
00:15:26,641 --> 00:15:27,485
Scott: They didn't have cartoons.

250
00:15:28,409 --> 00:15:28,650
Scott: There was.

251
00:15:28,851 --> 00:15:35,903
Scott: there were enough books and songs and whatever else they had that you in a human lifetime, especially since the human lives then were shorter.

252
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,479
Scott: You weren't going to get through it all.

253
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,001
Scott: Right.

254
00:15:39,682 --> 00:15:48,995
Scott: But now we're at a point where basically even a very unfortunate life that's also a long life.

255
00:15:49,137 --> 00:15:49,260
Scott: Right.

256
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:52,059
Scott: So you don't have a lot of resources, but you're going to be a live a long time.

257
00:15:52,781 --> 00:15:57,012
Scott: And even if you're going to work, it's like there is you will never like.

258
00:15:57,754 --> 00:16:08,122
Rym: I think I have enough entertainment to last the rest of my life just just in the videos folder of my NAS.

259
00:16:08,584 --> 00:16:13,480
Scott: Right now, there's enough stuff to last several lifetimes for basically anybody.

260
00:16:13,721 --> 00:16:14,002
Scott: Right.

261
00:16:14,263 --> 00:16:15,667
Scott: It's like so at the so.

262
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:26,442
Scott: how much money in a capitalist society, right, where we're not just we're not putting, you know, just valuing the creation of new art on its own, right?

263
00:16:26,602 --> 00:16:40,740
Rym: Only valuing how popular is your art, especially when the majority of people consuming art don't actually care that much about what particular thing they consume, which you may think that sounds crazy.

264
00:16:41,422 --> 00:16:44,280
Rym: You're listening to a weird podcast by two guys like us.

265
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:49,080
Rym: You are already such an extreme edge case that you are irrelevant to capitalism.

266
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:49,941
Scott: All right.

267
00:16:50,021 --> 00:17:00,145
Scott: So speaking of cartoons making any money, for some reason, this anime season, there must be some way that anime are making money because they're sure are making a lot of them.

268
00:17:00,246 --> 00:17:02,160
Rym: Well, they don't pay anyone who makes anime anything.

269
00:17:02,342 --> 00:17:04,339
Rym: So that'll eventually dry up on its own.

270
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:05,343
Scott: Right.

271
00:17:05,604 --> 00:17:08,800
Scott: You know, a lot of them are propped up by sponsors or whatnot.

272
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:27,180
Scott: But anyway, this anime season that just started like right now is quite unusual in that I'm counting at least six to eight shows that are worth like me paying it personally, keeping notice of if not just watching.

273
00:17:27,661 --> 00:17:27,782
Scott: Right.

274
00:17:27,803 --> 00:17:29,280
Scott: Which is a very large number.

275
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:36,440
Scott: The typical anime season, usually there's like two to three shows that maybe I'm thinking about a little bit.

276
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:40,060
Rym: Remember when we used to do, we'd judge anime by its cover.

277
00:17:40,301 --> 00:17:43,940
Rym: We were really rarely wrong and there'd always be two or three like every season.

278
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,739
Scott: This season has a lot.

279
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,600
Scott: So what is out this season?

280
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:51,920
Scott: So there's several series that are getting sort of additional seasons.

281
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:52,281
Scott: Right.

282
00:17:52,302 --> 00:17:56,828
Scott: I think there's a new Golden Kamuy season, which is something I thought about watching.

283
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:57,940
Scott: It's a borderline one.

284
00:17:58,725 --> 00:17:58,927
Rym: Right.

285
00:17:58,968 --> 00:18:00,040
Rym: That's for when I'm retired.

286
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,060
Scott: Yeah.

287
00:18:01,422 --> 00:18:07,760
Scott: Mob Psycho, which I watched the first season of, has, I think, a third season coming out now.

288
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,446
Rym: That show's great.

289
00:18:08,547 --> 00:18:09,820
Rym: I didn't even finish the first season.

290
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,640
Rym: I just haven't had time.

291
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:11,424
Scott: Yeah.

292
00:18:11,606 --> 00:18:12,498
Scott: I mean, it was OK.

293
00:18:12,921 --> 00:18:17,200
Scott: I didn't really feel compelled to watch the second season, but I know it's a big deal show for a lot of people.

294
00:18:17,482 --> 00:18:19,137
Scott: So it's worth paying attention to.

295
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:31,499
Scott: The Spy X Family, which I've now watched three episodes of in the first season, which I know is a big deal for a lot of people, is definitely the kind of show we would instantly show at the anime club if we were still running it.

296
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,389
Scott: Oh, absolutely.

297
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,120
Scott: It's a big time.

298
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:33,421
Scott: Right.

299
00:18:33,985 --> 00:18:34,931
Scott: OK, but now what?

300
00:18:35,132 --> 00:18:36,240
Scott: what other shows are right?

301
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:41,271
Scott: Oh, there's that pop team epic, you know, that really one that's like the wacky comedy one.

302
00:18:41,292 --> 00:18:41,677
Scott: Right.

303
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:44,217
Scott: That one has a new season going on right now.

304
00:18:45,521 --> 00:18:49,760
Scott: Yo, a pedal, which I care about finally has a new season.

305
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,899
Scott: They ended the previous season, I guess, a few years back.

306
00:18:53,522 --> 00:18:54,387
Scott: All right.

307
00:18:54,427 --> 00:18:56,639
Scott: They ended that previous season in the middle of a race.

308
00:18:57,722 --> 00:19:00,599
Rym: I assume that they will never finish this race.

309
00:19:01,221 --> 00:19:06,363
Scott: No, the new season starting like in like less than a day or like it already started, I think maybe.

310
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:10,598
Scott: And I'm pretty sure it just picks right up where they left off in the middle of that race.

311
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,150
Rym: Yeah.

312
00:19:12,354 --> 00:19:12,660
Rym: All right.

313
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,380
Rym: So I doubt that season will finish the race.

314
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,340
Rym: I think I think that whole season is going to get to the final of the race.

315
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,607
Scott: There's been enough seasons.

316
00:19:19,627 --> 00:19:21,639
Scott: They've already finished a handful of races.

317
00:19:22,842 --> 00:19:26,779
Rym: I mean, Initial D got more car races done than they just took a few years.

318
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,347
Scott: They just took a few years off.

319
00:19:28,407 --> 00:19:30,600
Scott: They're way behind the manga, as far as I'm aware.

320
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:31,541
Scott: All right.

321
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:37,220
Scott: That remake that anniversary remake of Urusei Yatsura.

322
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,788
Rym: I want to watch that.

323
00:19:38,849 --> 00:19:40,160
Rym: That looks so good.

324
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,429
Rym: The animation looks so good.

325
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:42,800
Rym: The voice acting's not sublime.

326
00:19:43,263 --> 00:19:45,679
Scott: You know, if it's not any good, you can just watch.

327
00:19:46,441 --> 00:19:52,860
Rym: But it looks like just judging it by its cover, it is the exact inverse of what happened with Sailor Moon Crystal.

328
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:58,900
Scott: Somehow, I don't know how the fuck this happened, right?

329
00:19:59,242 --> 00:20:00,399
Scott: Anyone remembered this at all.

330
00:20:01,523 --> 00:20:05,903
Scott: But I encountered at least one or two people outside my usual circle who remembered this.

331
00:20:05,964 --> 00:20:07,460
Scott: And I was like, wow, I'm not the only one.

332
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:07,901
Scott: All right.

333
00:20:07,921 --> 00:20:12,140
Scott: So there's a show from way back, way back called Digi Carrot.

334
00:20:12,261 --> 00:20:13,699
Scott: So this show.

335
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:17,366
Scott: Yeah, right.

336
00:20:17,827 --> 00:20:21,660
Scott: So this show was just some sort of comedy short series.

337
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,565
Rym: If you even know what we're talking about, your back definitely hurt when you woke up this morning.

338
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:27,880
Scott: Absolutely.

339
00:20:29,622 --> 00:20:33,680
Scott: And basically there was a. there was a I don't know if there still is, but there was.

340
00:20:33,921 --> 00:20:38,080
Scott: it might still exist, a chain of nerdy stores in Japan called Gamers.

341
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,440
Scott: Like Gamers is the name of the store, a physical retail store.

342
00:20:42,122 --> 00:20:49,200
Scott: And the store had like a mascot that was, you know, this Digi Carrot cat girl kind of character with bells on her head or whatever.

343
00:20:50,221 --> 00:20:50,422
Scott: Right.

344
00:20:50,442 --> 00:20:53,359
Rym: The other Robbie and Rose, the rabbit that I guess her nemesis.

345
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:55,303
Scott: I don't know.

346
00:20:55,383 --> 00:21:00,303
Scott: But there was like a, you know, they made an anime series like based on this character.

347
00:21:00,584 --> 00:21:05,784
Scott: And now there's like a new remake of it for the anniversary or something like that.

348
00:21:06,207 --> 00:21:17,720
Scott: And it's it's basically the same thing as like I don't know if people realize the tick, you know, the blue guy that there was a comic book store in the United States called New England Comics and the tick was like their mascot.

349
00:21:17,961 --> 00:21:23,513
Scott: And they would use the tick as like a parody superhero in their in like their advertising flyers.

350
00:21:23,957 --> 00:21:24,180
Scott: Right.

351
00:21:24,722 --> 00:21:28,720
Scott: And then somebody made a comic, a real comic book series with the tick.

352
00:21:28,941 --> 00:21:31,300
Scott: And then it became a cartoon and became a TV show.

353
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,124
Scott: And then it be right.

354
00:21:32,445 --> 00:21:37,179
Scott: And Digi Carrot is basically the same deal where some store mascot became a thing.

355
00:21:38,362 --> 00:21:40,611
Scott: There were a lot better mascots that never became.

356
00:21:40,631 --> 00:21:42,760
Scott: that had a narrative series.

357
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:46,940
Scott: It's like there's no fucking Tony the Tiger comic or cartoon.

358
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:47,684
Scott: It's just commercial.

359
00:21:47,704 --> 00:21:53,200
Rym: Well, the reason they haven't done that, I assume, is solely because so many people are so openly horny for Tony.

360
00:21:53,381 --> 00:21:54,535
Scott: Just make a horny one.

361
00:21:54,677 --> 00:21:54,839
Scott: Yeah.

362
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,325
Rym: Lean into it.

363
00:21:56,365 --> 00:21:59,800
Rym: To make me the product manager, I will make you so much goddamn money.

364
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,540
Rym: That demographic has unlimited resources.

365
00:22:03,242 --> 00:22:04,415
Scott: The New York Rangers.

366
00:22:04,597 --> 00:22:04,840
Scott: Right.

367
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,165
Scott: You know, it's hockey season now.

368
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:09,646
Scott: We just won big first game undefeated New York Rangers.

369
00:22:10,397 --> 00:22:10,640
Scott: Yeah.

370
00:22:11,922 --> 00:22:16,320
Scott: They are leaning hard into the Cried Vantage ad bromance.

371
00:22:16,441 --> 00:22:16,804
Scott: Oh, yeah.

372
00:22:16,906 --> 00:22:17,108
Scott: Right.

373
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:18,320
Scott: In the social media.

374
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,679
Scott: They are not shying away.

375
00:22:20,442 --> 00:22:25,457
Scott: It was amazing to see that they find no reason that Frosted Flakes could not do the exact same thing.

376
00:22:27,403 --> 00:22:29,220
Rym: Anyway, give me the grainy anime.

377
00:22:29,863 --> 00:22:30,104
Scott: Yeah.

378
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:33,400
Scott: So did you care remake of some kind or new season or something?

379
00:22:33,722 --> 00:22:34,250
Scott: What the hell?

380
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:34,880
Scott: Like what?

381
00:22:36,843 --> 00:22:40,900
Scott: And then, of course, the number one, you know, cannot be ignored.

382
00:22:41,381 --> 00:22:43,199
Scott: The Chainsaw Man anime has begun.

383
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,343
Rym: Yeah.

384
00:22:44,705 --> 00:22:48,260
Scott: Chainsaw Man is the biggest deal in the anime manga world.

385
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:53,326
Rym: I got to finish reading the manga because I feel like we should do a final thoughts, like full review of it.

386
00:22:53,647 --> 00:22:56,120
Scott: And I read the whole first manga series.

387
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,760
Scott: Another manga series is coming.

388
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:03,202
Scott: And, you know, who knows how much of the anime, the manga, the anime season will cover.

389
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,360
Scott: But yeah, the first episode is out.

390
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:06,820
Rym: Yep.

391
00:23:07,362 --> 00:23:13,199
Rym: And also, don't forget, Cyberpunk Edgerunners, which I think both my mom and dad will also be into.

392
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:17,080
Scott: I don't think that counts as like current anime season, but I do want to watch it.

393
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:17,680
Scott: Yeah.

394
00:23:17,861 --> 00:23:24,499
Rym: I mean, it is of all the animated things that I could watch right now, regardless of where and how I watch them.

395
00:23:25,202 --> 00:23:33,420
Rym: That's actually at the top of the list for me, because that is the ultra-violent sci-fi type of anime that got me into anime when I was in fourth grade.

396
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,300
Rym: Like that is the shit.

397
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,660
Scott: I don't think it's going to be more ultra-violent than Chainsaw Man.

398
00:23:39,303 --> 00:23:44,000
Rym: It is very much monofilament whip, the anime.

399
00:23:46,142 --> 00:23:46,433
Scott: Chainsaw.

400
00:23:47,661 --> 00:23:48,560
Scott: Monofilament whip.

401
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,780
Scott: The bad guy in Chainsaw Man is the gun devil.

402
00:23:52,382 --> 00:23:53,264
Rym: Yeah.

403
00:23:54,006 --> 00:24:07,240
Rym: I just want to remind you, anyone out there, if you if you imagine what cyberpunk is to people of our generation, we think of a little chain gun called Reason and we think about monofilament whips.

404
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,376
Rym: Now, fucking badass, they sound like they are.

405
00:24:11,982 --> 00:24:12,664
Rym: But yeah, there is.

406
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:17,321
Rym: there is a lot of good anime to watch, irrespective of the doom and gloom.

407
00:24:17,362 --> 00:24:19,420
Rym: we just talked about of capitalism destroying anything.

408
00:24:20,461 --> 00:24:23,612
Scott: Yeah, I wonder when is capitalism going to be able to destroy anime?

409
00:24:23,913 --> 00:24:26,829
Rym: or will the passion keep it going?

410
00:24:27,556 --> 00:24:27,919
Scott: I don't know.

411
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:45,510
Rym: But anyway, things of the day, so I can't use that PBS space time that I use that I watch and I used once because, you know, we have a rule.

412
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:47,449
Rym: Am I going to keep using the same channel over and over again?

413
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:51,829
Rym: PBS has a parallel channel with a different guy so I can talk about it.

414
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:54,969
Rym: There is PBS Eons, different guy.

415
00:24:55,754 --> 00:24:58,210
Rym: And this video is fascinating.

416
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:08,130
Rym: So it's kind of topical because we're, you know, years into basically the most the biggest pandemic in like modern history in the world.

417
00:25:08,952 --> 00:25:12,130
Rym: And this video is about the biggest pandemic ever.

418
00:25:12,831 --> 00:25:32,830
Rym: There was a pandemic with a virus that lasted at least 15 million years and was so absolutely devastating that almost all mammals alive today are the ancestors of the few that survived this 15 million year pandemic.

419
00:25:33,955 --> 00:25:35,287
Scott: So but mammals somehow made it.

420
00:25:35,972 --> 00:25:37,609
Rym: Yes, because a lot of them didn't.

421
00:25:37,991 --> 00:25:43,010
Rym: And this video talks about how we figured out that this disease even existed.

422
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:44,528
Rym: And it is records.

423
00:25:44,851 --> 00:25:45,091
Rym: It is.

424
00:25:45,191 --> 00:25:53,515
Rym: This is remnants of the adaptations that allowed certain orders of mammals to survive.

425
00:25:53,555 --> 00:25:55,550
Rym: This are in our DNA today.

426
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:59,250
Rym: And we found these fragments in like every mammal.

427
00:25:59,812 --> 00:26:04,649
Rym: And then we found that the very small number of mammals that do not have it.

428
00:26:05,332 --> 00:26:09,730
Rym: And there's a lot of stuff I do not understand enough to even briefly summarize.

429
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,570
Rym: The video is only 10 minutes long.

430
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:13,149
Rym: It does a way better job than I possibly could.

431
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:14,970
Rym: This is so fascinating.

432
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,132
Rym: Just watch it.

433
00:26:16,232 --> 00:26:23,848
Rym: But, yeah, 15 million years, hopefully coronavirus, maybe in like 100 years, will deal with it.

434
00:26:24,294 --> 00:26:26,770
Rym: Maybe 50, maybe 20.

435
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:27,251
Scott: I don't know.

436
00:26:29,096 --> 00:26:38,610
Rym: At least a ton of people I know got COVID relatively recently at work, and I did not, despite being directly, deeply exposed to all of those people.

437
00:26:39,212 --> 00:26:42,290
Rym: And the only difference between me and them, I got the new booster.

438
00:26:42,692 --> 00:26:43,294
Rym: None of them did.

439
00:26:43,455 --> 00:26:47,050
Rym: So if you did not get the new coronavirus booster, go get it.

440
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,149
Rym: Like, do not wait.

441
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:53,970
Scott: All right, so I don't think I've used this guy as a thing of the day before.

442
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,410
Rym: You've talked about it with me, but I don't.

443
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,786
Rym: Yeah, I don't think you've actually talked about it.

444
00:26:57,652 --> 00:27:04,430
Scott: There is an Internet creator primarily on TikTok, but also a YouTube channel where he sometimes cross posts his content.

445
00:27:05,114 --> 00:27:06,309
Scott: And I become a huge fan.

446
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:07,172
Scott: Right.

447
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:11,010
Scott: This guy, I think his real name is Masoud Boumgard.

448
00:27:11,516 --> 00:27:12,630
Scott: He's a stand up comedian.

449
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:18,770
Scott: I think he's from South Africa, I think, because I watch some of his stand up on YouTube and that's what he mentions it once or twice.

450
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:19,252
Scott: Right.

451
00:27:19,272 --> 00:27:20,289
Scott: So I think that's where he is.

452
00:27:20,491 --> 00:27:21,247
Scott: Not 100 percent sure.

453
00:27:23,831 --> 00:27:25,930
Scott: And he has created a character.

454
00:27:26,651 --> 00:27:26,993
Scott: Right.

455
00:27:27,215 --> 00:27:32,149
Scott: It's sort of like Uncle Roger, right, where he's like, it's actually a stand up comedian who's created a character that they pretend to be.

456
00:27:32,512 --> 00:27:33,670
Scott: And that's the joke.

457
00:27:33,791 --> 00:27:34,012
Scott: Right.

458
00:27:34,514 --> 00:27:37,510
Scott: And the character he has created is self help sing, right?

459
00:27:37,731 --> 00:27:38,555
Scott: S-I-N-G-H.

460
00:27:39,238 --> 00:27:41,590
Scott: And he's an alternative life coach.

461
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:48,010
Scott: So if you think if you're going to parody those self help guru type people.

462
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:48,771
Scott: Right.

463
00:27:49,014 --> 00:27:50,510
Scott: Well, those people are all full of shit.

464
00:27:51,194 --> 00:27:52,569
Scott: So if you tried to parody them.

465
00:27:53,051 --> 00:27:53,312
Scott: Right.

466
00:27:53,634 --> 00:27:58,510
Scott: It's like it's going to be one of those situations where you can't tell the parody apart from the reality.

467
00:27:58,672 --> 00:27:58,773
Scott: Right.

468
00:27:58,793 --> 00:28:00,388
Scott: You're just going to end up being one of them.

469
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:09,370
Scott: So what he's done is sort of genius in that by being it's like if you are alternative, alternative medicine would just be medicine.

470
00:28:09,932 --> 00:28:13,930
Scott: So an alternative self help guru is just a legitimate.

471
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,810
Scott: So like someone who will actually help you and give you good advice.

472
00:28:17,751 --> 00:28:18,196
Scott: Right.

473
00:28:18,236 --> 00:28:18,600
Scott: Right.

474
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:27,644
Scott: And so all his videos are pretty much the philosophy that I already had in life just being told to me.

475
00:28:29,933 --> 00:28:30,315
Scott: He's like.

476
00:28:30,355 --> 00:28:32,650
Scott: he's like, fuck the work deadlines.

477
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:34,389
Scott: Nobody will actually die.

478
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,254
Scott: Right.

479
00:28:35,816 --> 00:28:38,989
Scott: It's like if you have a shitty day, go home and go to bed.

480
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:52,533
Scott: It's like, yeah, it's like all this really common sense advice you should actually follow presented as if it's not good advice you shouldn't follow from some weird self help guy.

481
00:28:52,954 --> 00:29:00,088
Rym: And that is that is a magic combination of being parody, but also being actually legit like that is hard to do.

482
00:29:01,211 --> 00:29:04,209
Scott: Yeah, so I really have become a big fan of this guy.

483
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:07,149
Rym: I mean, his philosophy is very much like how I live my life.

484
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:08,733
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty.

485
00:29:08,753 --> 00:29:14,670
Scott: it's like if you need a real self help guru, you need the alternative self help guru because the real ones are bullshit.

486
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:15,112
Rym: Right.

487
00:29:15,132 --> 00:29:15,987
Rym: So what did I tell you?

488
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:21,611
Rym: Because I like someone I was doing some mentoring for in their career a few weeks ago.

489
00:29:21,932 --> 00:29:27,419
Rym: And I basically said the company won't burn down if this project doesn't go exactly right.

490
00:29:27,661 --> 00:29:28,510
Rym: Like that's right.

491
00:29:29,052 --> 00:29:36,610
Rym: And if the company would burn down because this project doesn't go exactly right, you need to be paid way more money because this is a really important project.

492
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:37,651
Scott: Yeah.

493
00:29:37,671 --> 00:29:38,194
Scott: What are the other?

494
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:43,230
Scott: if everyone is depending on this thing happening on a certain day, otherwise a disaster will happen.

495
00:29:43,491 --> 00:29:48,134
Scott: Then that means you are so critical and so important that you should be paid a zillion dollars.

496
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:52,292
Scott: It's like, you know, like the star franchise athlete on a team or something.

497
00:29:52,634 --> 00:29:53,639
Rym: I would say that there is.

498
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,174
Rym: there are a few cases where society gets that wrong.

499
00:29:56,214 --> 00:29:57,370
Rym: That's a whole different conversation.

500
00:29:57,471 --> 00:29:59,310
Rym: Like teachers should be paid a lot.

501
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:00,354
Rym: They're very important.

502
00:30:00,736 --> 00:30:06,348
Scott: All I'm saying is that if everyone followed the advice of self-help, saying the world, our society would be incredible.

503
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:14,210
Rym: Well, because remember the thing about self-help, like actual self-help, not fake self-help is similar to psychotherapy and everything else.

504
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:22,490
Rym: You can't therapy your way out of the crushing despair caused directly by capitalism and a cruel and indifferent society.

505
00:30:22,992 --> 00:30:28,673
Rym: But you can react to those evil and dangerous pressures in a more healthy manner.

506
00:30:28,935 --> 00:30:30,910
Rym: You can't solve the problem, but you can change.

507
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:34,891
Rym: You can try to change your attitude about how you react to the problem you can't solve.

508
00:30:35,995 --> 00:30:42,699
Scott: I'll always remember the mural that was painted, you know, nearby some years back that said anxiety was.

509
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:45,530
Scott: it said anxiety is normal in an unjust society.

510
00:30:46,514 --> 00:30:46,635
Scott: Yup.

511
00:30:46,656 --> 00:30:48,210
Scott: It's like this injustice.

512
00:30:48,412 --> 00:30:50,550
Scott: If you don't stop the injustice, of course, it's going to be.

513
00:30:52,011 --> 00:30:56,569
Scott: It's like, you know, if you just try to stop the anxiety and let the injustice continue, they ain't going to work.

514
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:57,010
Rym: Yup.

515
00:30:57,994 --> 00:31:00,703
Rym: So in the news, let's see the.

516
00:31:00,743 --> 00:31:05,010
Rym: the panel Emily and I did at PAX West is, of course, on our website.

517
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:09,370
Rym: The Book Club book is Binti, which read all three.

518
00:31:09,771 --> 00:31:14,570
Rym: It'll take you like three hours, maybe six hours total if you're a slow reader.

519
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:15,734
Rym: It's real good.

520
00:31:15,754 --> 00:31:18,950
Rym: We'll probably do the show on it next week on Thursday.

521
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:19,908
Rym: I see no reason not to.

522
00:31:20,972 --> 00:31:21,948
Scott: Unless something else comes up.

523
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,330
Rym: Yeah, something else comes up.

524
00:31:23,831 --> 00:31:27,214
Rym: I didn't do the thing that might have gotten in the way of this episode because nobody else wanted to go.

525
00:31:27,254 --> 00:31:33,070
Rym: And also it is crazy windy outside, which might have made that event a little bit difficult to attend comfortably.

526
00:31:34,071 --> 00:31:34,557
Scott: Yeah.

527
00:31:34,618 --> 00:31:35,530
Scott: Why not have it on a Wednesday?

528
00:31:36,151 --> 00:31:36,412
Scott: Yeah.

529
00:31:37,677 --> 00:31:41,030
Rym: But otherwise, I guess you'll have to pick the next book club book.

530
00:31:41,151 --> 00:31:41,929
Rym: Are you going to do the choice?

531
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:44,090
Scott: I already have to two books selected.

532
00:31:44,531 --> 00:31:44,792
Rym: Yes.

533
00:31:45,053 --> 00:31:47,889
Rym: I also have two books selected for the following one.

534
00:31:49,634 --> 00:31:50,488
Rym: It's going to be a fun time.

535
00:31:51,311 --> 00:31:58,190
Rym: So if you don't remember, the way we're going to do the book club now is whoever's turned it is to pick has to choose two books.

536
00:31:59,211 --> 00:32:01,970
Rym: And the other of us chooses which of the two.

537
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:04,550
Rym: It's an I slice you pick situation.

538
00:32:05,733 --> 00:32:06,469
Scott: I cut you choose.

539
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:06,892
Rym: Yep.

540
00:32:07,438 --> 00:32:08,349
Rym: Well, we'll see how it goes.

541
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:13,069
Rym: And otherwise, websites coming along, we got a bunch of stuff going on.

542
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:16,888
Rym: Stay tuned for there will be gig nights panels at PAX Unplugged.

543
00:32:17,492 --> 00:32:19,450
Rym: Maybe there'll be Rym and Scott together.

544
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:22,289
Rym: Maybe it'll just be Rym as the last several PAXs have been.

545
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:25,210
Rym: The world wonders and we will see how that goes.

546
00:32:25,531 --> 00:32:26,286
Rym: But that's not now.

547
00:32:27,272 --> 00:32:32,810
Rym: And we don't have any major hiatus coming up except for the regularly scheduled ones around the end of the year holidays.

548
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:35,270
Rym: So with that, let's talk about some shows.

549
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:36,590
Rym: So you want to talk about Gundam first?

550
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:37,750
Rym: Then I can talk about Star Trek.

551
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:38,792
Scott: Yeah.

552
00:32:38,872 --> 00:32:41,268
Scott: So this so so people are aware, right?

553
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:44,470
Scott: The original Mobile Suit Gundam, right?

554
00:32:44,571 --> 00:32:47,309
Scott: The original TV series from nineteen seventy nine.

555
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:47,951
Scott: Right.

556
00:32:48,573 --> 00:32:54,010
Scott: When that show came out, the art director of that show.

557
00:32:54,911 --> 00:32:56,021
Scott: Right.

558
00:32:56,061 --> 00:32:57,090
Scott: What was his name?

559
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:59,368
Scott: I always forget his name, even though it's right there.

560
00:33:01,132 --> 00:33:02,830
Scott: Oh, Yoshikazu Yasuhiko.

561
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:03,450
Scott: Right.

562
00:33:04,756 --> 00:33:08,230
Scott: He is also the person who made the Gundam the origin manga.

563
00:33:08,872 --> 00:33:15,370
Scott: And just so we get this out of the way, if you want to experience the story of the original Gundam, right.

564
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:17,970
Scott: Char, Amuro, all that shit.

565
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:18,531
Scott: Right.

566
00:33:18,772 --> 00:33:21,890
Scott: The manga is the best rendition, period.

567
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:22,451
Scott: Right.

568
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:26,770
Scott: The three compilation movies being the second best rendition anyway.

569
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:30,210
Scott: But when they were making that original TV series, right.

570
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:35,889
Scott: The art director, Yasuhiko, he got sick around episode fifteen or so.

571
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:36,611
Scott: Right.

572
00:33:36,671 --> 00:33:43,830
Scott: At least when they were working on those episodes and he was out and they, you know, they were outsourcing some animation and stuff and he just wasn't there.

573
00:33:44,253 --> 00:33:46,129
Scott: For a set for a few episodes or whatever.

574
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:51,230
Scott: In episode fifteen, which was titled Kukunu's Dawn's Island.

575
00:33:52,051 --> 00:33:55,549
Scott: It was this little story about an island that they went to and whatnot.

576
00:33:57,112 --> 00:33:59,223
Scott: That episode was animated poorly.

577
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:03,247
Scott: Very poorly.

578
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:11,829
Scott: If you've seen, you've probably seen these meme images of like, you know, the original Gundam with like its head drawn very stupidly.

579
00:34:13,112 --> 00:34:17,670
Scott: If you see the image, you might recognize this is not that uncommon in anime.

580
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:22,414
Rym: There are almost any long running or major show will have like the episodes that are drawn.

581
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:23,369
Rym: weird for some reason.

582
00:34:24,172 --> 00:34:24,333
Scott: Right.

583
00:34:24,373 --> 00:34:28,190
Scott: Well, anyway, that image is from this episode.

584
00:34:29,253 --> 00:34:32,010
Scott: It's just really bad animation in this episode.

585
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:42,770
Scott: And because of the infamy of this episode, when the show was released in other countries, such as the US, that episode fifteen was not included.

586
00:34:43,313 --> 00:34:47,896
Scott: And it didn't really matter that it wasn't included because it was sort of like the standalone side story deal.

587
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:51,730
Scott: that didn't have a huge impact on the overall plot.

588
00:34:51,831 --> 00:34:52,927
Scott: You weren't really missing much.

589
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:53,992
Scott: Right.

590
00:34:54,152 --> 00:34:59,214
Scott: Like the compilation movies don't really include anything that happened in that episode.

591
00:34:59,435 --> 00:34:59,696
Scott: Right.

592
00:34:59,737 --> 00:35:00,943
Scott: It's like they were.

593
00:35:00,964 --> 00:35:02,050
Scott: it was compiled out.

594
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:05,870
Scott: So because of that, it became infamous.

595
00:35:06,132 --> 00:35:06,314
Scott: Right.

596
00:35:06,334 --> 00:35:08,189
Scott: Like we want to see the lost episode.

597
00:35:09,271 --> 00:35:15,909
Rym: You know, spoilers, most things that are infamous and they're not actually worth seeing anyway.

598
00:35:16,731 --> 00:35:27,150
Scott: So for some reason, due to the infamy of this episode, right, they did what was sort of like the opposite of a compilation movie is like an expansion movie.

599
00:35:27,711 --> 00:35:32,119
Scott: It came out this past summer, right, in Japan is.

600
00:35:32,219 --> 00:35:48,850
Scott: they made a whole movie, right, a script of that episode and stretching it out to like, you know, movie length and producing it with modern animation, some CG robots a little bit, you know.

601
00:35:49,171 --> 00:35:51,929
Rym: Now, I got to say, that is a pretty cool thing to do.

602
00:35:52,352 --> 00:35:54,730
Rym: And I would like to see that happen to other things.

603
00:35:55,772 --> 00:35:56,014
Scott: Right.

604
00:35:56,034 --> 00:35:58,050
Scott: So they just took this episode and they stretched it out.

605
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:08,029
Scott: And I'm like, man, it's like instead of compilation movies, you try to take a whole like forty nine, thirty nine episode series, twenty six episodes and squish it so someone can watch it in less time.

606
00:36:08,632 --> 00:36:09,810
Scott: What if you did an expansion?

607
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:10,470
Scott: Right.

608
00:36:10,491 --> 00:36:14,870
Scott: Why not take every episode of Evangelion and make each one a movie?

609
00:36:15,431 --> 00:36:16,408
Scott: Ninety minutes each.

610
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:17,913
Scott: Right.

611
00:36:17,993 --> 00:36:21,910
Rym: That was a trend for a brief time in anime.

612
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:24,077
Rym: Remember, there was Tenji Muyo, the

613
00:36:24,138 --> 00:36:24,580
Rym: O.A.V.,

614
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:29,359
Rym: and then there was Tenji Muyo, the TV series that was just spread out.

615
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,950
Scott: and was it twenty six movies?

616
00:36:33,113 --> 00:36:33,656
Rym: It was basically.

617
00:36:33,676 --> 00:36:35,609
Rym: they took a short O.A.V.

618
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:39,070
Rym: and expanded it into a long, boring TV show.

619
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:40,509
Rym: And the same thing happened with El Hazzar.

620
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:47,970
Scott: We've got, you know, you got your Futurama and your Adventure Time, you know, movies that happened after the TV series is right.

621
00:36:48,475 --> 00:36:49,389
Scott: But those are only a handful.

622
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:56,190
Rym: It was like, no, take like the Puhoi episode of Adventure Time, which is one of the more important and famous episodes.

623
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:57,329
Rym: That's the Pillow People episode.

624
00:36:58,053 --> 00:37:01,468
Rym: I have to keep saying that because apparently no one remembers that it's called Puhoi, except me.

625
00:37:02,351 --> 00:37:07,315
Rym: I don't know why I remember that, but imagine if that was an hour and a half long movie.

626
00:37:07,618 --> 00:37:08,530
Rym: That would be fantastic.

627
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:12,070
Scott: So anyway, they took this episode that was infamous.

628
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:15,290
Scott: They expanded it and fleshed it out to be a whole movie.

629
00:37:15,671 --> 00:37:20,982
Scott: And when the movie starts, right, it says this is a retelling of episode fifteen of Mobile Suit Gundam.

630
00:37:21,367 --> 00:37:21,570
Scott: Right.

631
00:37:21,813 --> 00:37:22,606
Scott: And now we're starting.

632
00:37:22,667 --> 00:37:22,830
Scott: Right.

633
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:25,662
Scott: It's like it doesn't pretend that like, you know, any.

634
00:37:25,883 --> 00:37:29,390
Scott: it's like it expects you to have just watched episodes one through fourteen.

635
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:31,268
Scott: It's not to know who these characters are.

636
00:37:32,013 --> 00:37:32,214
Scott: Right.

637
00:37:32,535 --> 00:37:37,969
Scott: Like you can still enjoy the movie not knowing who the characters are because you'll know that like, oh, that's a Gundam pilot, I guess.

638
00:37:38,314 --> 00:37:38,537
Scott: Right.

639
00:37:38,577 --> 00:37:39,490
Scott: I guess that's the captain.

640
00:37:39,631 --> 00:37:40,808
Scott: I guess that's their friend.

641
00:37:41,411 --> 00:37:51,434
Scott: Like there won't be any meaning to those characters because those characters that are the Gundam characters don't have any character development or exposition in the episode.

642
00:37:51,474 --> 00:37:52,686
Scott: Like you're supposed to know who they are.

643
00:37:53,891 --> 00:38:04,050
Scott: But other than not knowing who they are, everything else about the plot, you know, the new characters that are introduced just for the movie, et cetera, et cetera, like you can completely understand the story.

644
00:38:04,453 --> 00:38:05,650
Scott: It's totally self-contained.

645
00:38:06,134 --> 00:38:07,609
Scott: It begins, middles, ends.

646
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:15,550
Scott: You know, you can watch this, but it obviously will have much more meaning if you know anything about the original Gundam.

647
00:38:17,773 --> 00:38:20,850
Scott: And, you know, is this some great anime movie?

648
00:38:21,372 --> 00:38:24,409
Scott: Like, you know, the ones we say, oh, you got to go to the theater and see them.

649
00:38:26,411 --> 00:38:36,150
Scott: No, it's, it's a TV episode that's just way better produced and bigger and better and nicer and, you know, well done.

650
00:38:36,812 --> 00:38:38,930
Scott: And, you know, it's worth seeing, I guess.

651
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:49,210
Scott: But, you know, it's not run out and see, like we say for, you know, the Hosoda movies and the, you know, the Yuasa movies and the Miyazaki movies and all those.

652
00:38:50,694 --> 00:38:50,935
Scott: Right.

653
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,069
Scott: But, yeah, I mean, there are.

654
00:38:54,651 --> 00:39:03,330
Scott: I haven't seen the original old bad episode, so I don't know, like, what things were added, what things are removed, if any, what things were changed.

655
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:08,550
Rym: But, you know, I mean, that old episode is probably only twenty three minutes long.

656
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:09,175
Rym: You could just go.

657
00:39:09,276 --> 00:39:10,368
Scott: Yes, indeed it is.

658
00:39:13,336 --> 00:39:14,969
Scott: But, you know, I still enjoyed it.

659
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:15,351
Scott: Right.

660
00:39:15,371 --> 00:39:19,330
Scott: You know, it's pretty obvious, like what was going to happen in the in the movie.

661
00:39:19,531 --> 00:39:19,793
Scott: Right.

662
00:39:19,813 --> 00:39:21,504
Scott: It wasn't like, you know, a complicated plot.

663
00:39:24,017 --> 00:39:25,690
Scott: But, you know, it panned out well.

664
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:27,429
Scott: Everything really came together.

665
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:42,230
Scott: You know, there were, you know, a good, you know, progressive arc, but basically, I guess, short summary of it just to, you know, to wrap things up is, you know, the the main Gundam characters are on their on their ship, chilling, awaiting new orders.

666
00:39:42,591 --> 00:39:42,871
Scott: Right.

667
00:39:43,554 --> 00:39:51,009
Scott: And they get ordered to go on this mission to clean up some remnant hostels from a previous battle that are on this island.

668
00:39:51,991 --> 00:39:52,172
Scott: Right.

669
00:39:52,753 --> 00:40:01,427
Scott: And they go to the island and there's this dude there who's got a, you know, who's obviously a Xeon guy and he's got a fucking, you know, Zaku.

670
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:05,169
Scott: Yeah, he's got a Zaku and he's hella dangerous.

671
00:40:05,852 --> 00:40:06,155
Scott: Right.

672
00:40:06,438 --> 00:40:07,529
Scott: And they can't really beat him.

673
00:40:08,515 --> 00:40:09,530
Scott: And then there's bad weather.

674
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:20,790
Scott: And so after they send they send people in to go find out what's going on with the island and then they you know, they think, you know, they're dead because they're lost and they had they can't they can't search the island right now with the bad weather.

675
00:40:21,391 --> 00:40:21,632
Scott: Right.

676
00:40:21,793 --> 00:40:25,189
Rym: Well, that's like the plot of, I don't know, a third of all Star Trek episodes.

677
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:28,810
Scott: Anyway, it's an excuse to have them trapped there.

678
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:29,111
Scott: Right.

679
00:40:29,151 --> 00:40:37,249
Scott: And it turns out, you know, the the the the doin guy, that super bad ass Zaku pilot, he's got all these kids on the island he's taking care of.

680
00:40:37,471 --> 00:40:37,712
Scott: Right.

681
00:40:37,752 --> 00:40:40,910
Scott: He's he's a good guy and he's probably he's up to something good.

682
00:40:41,312 --> 00:40:43,870
Scott: You know, he's abandoned the the Xeon people.

683
00:40:43,951 --> 00:40:46,670
Scott: He's just defending the island from war in general.

684
00:40:47,251 --> 00:40:47,552
Scott: Right.

685
00:40:49,398 --> 00:40:54,392
Scott: And then, you know, shit happens and it turns out the secret shit on the island, of course.

686
00:40:54,573 --> 00:40:54,874
Scott: Right.

687
00:40:54,934 --> 00:41:05,550
Scott: And, you know, eventually Xeon comes back to the island and the good guys come back to the island and they fight and then everything is resolved somehow.

688
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:11,210
Rym: I mean, I guess it had to be because it was originally a self-contained episode that wasn't even important enough to compile.

689
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:12,495
Scott: It had to be.

690
00:41:12,535 --> 00:41:14,410
Scott: Otherwise, there wouldn't be episode 16.

691
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:16,089
Scott: You know, episode 16 is coming next.

692
00:41:17,774 --> 00:41:19,189
Scott: Did you at least know that much?

693
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:19,610
Scott: Right.

694
00:41:19,631 --> 00:41:25,192
Scott: It's really, you know, a story of the characters that are introduced for this episode.

695
00:41:25,252 --> 00:41:25,433
Scott: Right.

696
00:41:25,453 --> 00:41:39,008
Scott: Doan and the children and, you know, the Gundam characters are just sort of, you know, passing through to sort of reveal which is interesting because that is how like the Slayers movie slash OAVs were.

697
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:41,969
Rym: That is how a lot of the One Piece movies are.

698
00:41:42,211 --> 00:41:43,649
Scott: It is a lot like a Slayers movie.

699
00:41:44,832 --> 00:41:52,688
Rym: Like the main characters don't have an arc, they're just there and interact with the new characters who have an arc and that are never seen again.

700
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:54,463
Scott: Yep, exactly.

701
00:41:54,667 --> 00:41:54,850
Scott: Right.

702
00:41:55,551 --> 00:41:56,436
Scott: So it's one of those.

703
00:41:56,456 --> 00:41:58,930
Scott: It's a. it's a pretty good one of those, actually.

704
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:07,690
Scott: Like if you took and made the original Gundam series and made a movie like this for every episode, that would be a very positive, incredible thing.

705
00:42:07,851 --> 00:42:08,072
Scott: Right.

706
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:11,529
Scott: It's like it might take forty nine years if they do one a year.

707
00:42:12,031 --> 00:42:19,907
Scott: It might take it might take ninety eight years if they do one every other year, but I'm glad they made this.

708
00:42:20,391 --> 00:42:26,654
Scott: It sort of puts the infamy thing to rest, you know, if you and if you're a Gundam fan, see it.

709
00:42:26,815 --> 00:42:29,150
Scott: And if not, you know, but yeah, they aired it.

710
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:30,390
Scott: Oh, I forgot to mention this.

711
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:31,949
Scott: They aired it in the air.

712
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:32,190
Scott: It.

713
00:42:32,431 --> 00:42:38,671
Scott: it was in US theaters two nights only one night sub the next night dub one showing of each.

714
00:42:38,691 --> 00:42:39,233
Scott: And that was it.

715
00:42:39,815 --> 00:42:48,845
Scott: So to see it now, you're going to have to either wait for it to be streamed or Blu-rayed or pirated or imported or something.

716
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:51,873
Scott: Right.

717
00:42:52,375 --> 00:42:52,897
Scott: But I saw.

718
00:42:52,917 --> 00:42:56,836
Scott: I went to the movie theater and I saw it during the one night sub screening.

719
00:42:56,856 --> 00:42:58,009
Scott: And that was, you know.

720
00:42:58,732 --> 00:42:59,608
Rym: All right, not bad.

721
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:06,370
Rym: So the thing I watch that I know Scott will never watch will never watch.

722
00:43:06,571 --> 00:43:07,195
Rym: Yeah.

723
00:43:07,235 --> 00:43:09,530
Rym: So I'm on a big Star Trek kick again.

724
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:10,610
Rym: I rewatch DS nine.

725
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:14,709
Rym: And if you're a Star Trek fan, the Star Trek cup overflow recently.

726
00:43:15,512 --> 00:43:21,950
Rym: And other than the movies, because there's drama, all of the Star Trek TV shows are just on Paramount Plus.

727
00:43:22,452 --> 00:43:26,851
Rym: So I'm actually paying for that service because we were watching like all the Star Treks.

728
00:43:27,192 --> 00:43:36,050
Rym: But there are actually two different independent Star Trek animated series that are currently airing simultaneously.

729
00:43:36,433 --> 00:43:38,710
Rym: That are set in different times in different places.

730
00:43:40,473 --> 00:43:51,250
Rym: So this now brings the total of animated Star Treks to three, if any of you remember the original animated series, which even I knew that existed, even though I never watched it, didn't have that many episodes.

731
00:43:52,072 --> 00:43:53,190
Rym: In fact, it had two seasons.

732
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:59,009
Rym: So there is like twenty two episodes total of that animated series, the original one.

733
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:01,650
Rym: So lower decks I've talked about.

734
00:44:01,731 --> 00:44:02,418
Rym: It's fantastic.

735
00:44:02,458 --> 00:44:03,347
Rym: I love the shit out of it.

736
00:44:04,071 --> 00:44:22,810
Rym: Star Trek Prodigy is interesting because if I had to describe it one, if you did not know Star Trek existed, like say you've never heard of Star Trek, but you had heard of Star Wars and I showed you a random episode of, I don't know, Star Trek, the next generation, you would not think that this was Star Wars.

737
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:24,569
Rym: You would know that it was something different.

738
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:32,067
Rym: Just obviously it's so different in like how action is portrayed and how characters talk and what kinds of stories there are.

739
00:44:32,853 --> 00:44:35,150
Rym: But if I and I would say that is true of almost all Star Treks.

740
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:45,250
Rym: But if I showed you a random episode of Star Trek Prodigy and you would never heard of Star Trek, I think you would assume this is set in the Star Wars universe.

741
00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:46,614
Scott: Well, but there would.

742
00:44:46,634 --> 00:44:51,150
Scott: there were, first of all, even no matter how it's structured or the plot or the characters.

743
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:51,952
Scott: Right.

744
00:44:51,972 --> 00:44:55,090
Scott: A, there would be some people wearing like, you know, Starfleet uniform.

745
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:58,030
Rym: Ah, there really aren't in Star Trek Prodigy.

746
00:44:58,630 --> 00:44:58,992
Rym: All right.

747
00:44:59,214 --> 00:45:01,790
Rym: There is one character wearing a Star Trek uniform.

748
00:45:02,672 --> 00:45:03,501
Scott: Well, that would give it away.

749
00:45:03,521 --> 00:45:04,270
Scott: Just one is enough.

750
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:08,755
Rym: But if you had never heard of Star Trek, that's just that's just there's that one human wearing the weird uniform.

751
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:12,432
Scott: The other thing is that Star Wars, no matter which Star Wars it is.

752
00:45:12,733 --> 00:45:13,014
Scott: Right.

753
00:45:13,295 --> 00:45:21,550
Scott: There are certain like, you know, Star Wars things that are always going to like appear like, you know, a ship that looks something like an X-wing.

754
00:45:22,011 --> 00:45:22,253
Rym: Oh, yeah.

755
00:45:22,274 --> 00:45:23,729
Rym: There's there's stuff like that in this.

756
00:45:24,551 --> 00:45:24,752
Scott: Right.

757
00:45:24,912 --> 00:45:30,010
Scott: Or, you know, a guy wearing some armor that's reminiscent of a stormtrooper.

758
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:30,312
Rym: Yeah.

759
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:31,398
Rym: There is basically that.

760
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,410
Rym: there is basically a Darth Sidious.

761
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:36,550
Rym: There is basically a Darth Maul, like the bad guys.

762
00:45:37,391 --> 00:45:41,768
Scott: Aesthetically, like aesthetically, you would think that like, oh, is that is that?

763
00:45:41,969 --> 00:45:42,672
Scott: is that an evil?

764
00:45:42,914 --> 00:45:46,954
Rym: If you watch this, you look at one guy and think, whoa, is that like the Emperor's son?

765
00:45:47,014 --> 00:45:49,645
Rym: You see the other guy like, whoa, is that?

766
00:45:49,726 --> 00:45:55,069
Scott: so you're saying that they have pirated Star Wars aesthetics and into their show.

767
00:45:55,551 --> 00:46:05,809
Rym: So it's more that it's telling the kind of story that Star Wars, like the expanded Star Wars universe would tell more so than what Star Trek typically does.

768
00:46:07,472 --> 00:46:08,258
Scott: But why is it called?

769
00:46:08,278 --> 00:46:10,070
Scott: Prodigy is the name of a ship like usual.

770
00:46:10,514 --> 00:46:11,950
Rym: So that's actually TBD.

771
00:46:12,434 --> 00:46:13,345
Rym: So only one is out.

772
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:14,552
Rym: There's more coming.

773
00:46:15,114 --> 00:46:19,870
Rym: But basically it the ship in this one is not called the prodigy.

774
00:46:20,452 --> 00:46:22,169
Rym: It's it's a whole other thing going on.

775
00:46:22,631 --> 00:46:38,809
Rym: So to avoid getting into the details of Star Trek for the Scott audience, this is set after one of the other Star Trek's called Voyager, and it's way out in like so far away from the Federation that the Federation basically doesn't exist out there.

776
00:46:39,612 --> 00:46:44,189
Rym: And a Star Trek Federation ship is basically crashed or something happened to it.

777
00:46:44,531 --> 00:46:47,630
Rym: So it's out alone, way out in the edge of the universe.

778
00:46:48,491 --> 00:46:55,669
Rym: A bunch of kids who are basically slaves on a planet that is run by an evil Star Wars looking emperor type dude.

779
00:46:56,311 --> 00:46:59,550
Scott: Well, that sounds like the first Star Trek series slaves on a planet.

780
00:47:00,111 --> 00:47:04,330
Rym: They basically find this ship and use it to escape from this planet.

781
00:47:05,532 --> 00:47:07,230
Rym: The ship happens to be a Federation ship.

782
00:47:07,610 --> 00:47:11,210
Scott: They basically seal a Star Trek, a full size one like that has a city inside.

783
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:15,910
Rym: It is a full size Star Trek ship that is just a couple of kids.

784
00:47:16,373 --> 00:47:18,330
Rym: Yeah, a couple of kids works.

785
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:20,069
Scott: It crashed and it still works.

786
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:21,618
Rym: Well, we don't know what deal like.

787
00:47:21,658 --> 00:47:24,550
Scott: I'm trying to avoid the full of thousands upon thousands of corpses.

788
00:47:25,215 --> 00:47:26,089
Rym: And no, it's empty.

789
00:47:26,411 --> 00:47:35,210
Rym: In fact, the only thing on it when the kids get onto it is a hologram and holograms in the Star Trek universe or semi ascension like it's complicated.

790
00:47:35,810 --> 00:47:36,945
Scott: So it was guarding this.

791
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:38,806
Rym: No, no, it was guarding it.

792
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:41,289
Rym: They find it, salvaging it.

793
00:47:41,811 --> 00:47:48,529
Rym: No, in fact, the evil guys vaguely knew it was there and we're looking for it, but the kids found it.

794
00:47:48,611 --> 00:47:49,268
Rym: It's enormous.

795
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:51,149
Scott: Yeah, could you not find it?

796
00:47:51,753 --> 00:47:52,970
Rym: That is all revealed.

797
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:54,649
Rym: That's part of the story of the show.

798
00:47:55,410 --> 00:47:56,649
Scott: This doesn't make any fucking sense.

799
00:47:57,171 --> 00:48:00,710
Scott: OK, so the kids, even with my little Star Trek knowledge, it makes no sense.

800
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:01,194
Rym: Yeah.

801
00:48:01,214 --> 00:48:01,949
Rym: So it's kind of crazy.

802
00:48:02,131 --> 00:48:05,450
Rym: Actually, the kids find the ship and the deal is the ship.

803
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:15,150
Rym: The only thing on the ship is the hologram, which is a copy of a real starship captain from a previous Star Trek set way before this show happens, like Captain Jane.

804
00:48:15,313 --> 00:48:15,863
Scott: OK, well, that's good.

805
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:16,751
Scott: That's good.

806
00:48:16,992 --> 00:48:23,769
Rym: So the hologram sees these kids and is like, I guess you're the new cadets and the kids are like, boy, howdy.

807
00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:24,572
Rym: Yes.

808
00:48:25,417 --> 00:48:27,230
Scott: And the kids be like, we don't have to do it.

809
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:28,134
Scott: I mean, they want to.

810
00:48:28,234 --> 00:48:32,194
Rym: But if they basically want to steal the ship, so obviously they want to.

811
00:48:32,254 --> 00:48:34,110
Scott: But they could just be like, you're just a hologram.

812
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:34,975
Scott: You can't tell us what to do.

813
00:48:35,036 --> 00:48:41,350
Rym: Well, the hologram is currently able to run the whole ship and oh, that's how the corpses got disposed of.

814
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:42,749
Rym: OK, well, there are no corpses.

815
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:44,289
Rym: We don't know the deal with the ship yet.

816
00:48:44,891 --> 00:48:46,949
Rym: So the kids basically just are on the ship.

817
00:48:47,531 --> 00:48:50,370
Rym: They act like, yes, there's a hologram alone.

818
00:48:50,551 --> 00:49:00,020
Rym: Of course, we're cadets and the holograms like good because this ship is designed to train cadets on this whole sort of special mission and they don't understand and adventure.

819
00:49:00,061 --> 00:49:00,750
Scott: What a coincidence.

820
00:49:00,871 --> 00:49:01,714
Scott: That's probably a lie.

821
00:49:01,734 --> 00:49:07,308
Rym: Yeah, there's a whole real Star Trek plot, but that does not really get revealed until the end of season one.

822
00:49:09,253 --> 00:49:22,130
Rym: But if I had to describe what the show is actually about, not in a Star Trek context, these kids basically find the ship and go off on an adventure and there's a sinister undercurrent and the evil guys are chasing them.

823
00:49:22,453 --> 00:49:24,230
Rym: There's almost no human characters.

824
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:30,214
Scott: And it is just the evil guys who are who are enslaving them can chase them through space.

825
00:49:30,234 --> 00:49:32,650
Scott: It means they can fly in space.

826
00:49:32,751 --> 00:49:33,033
Scott: Yes.

827
00:49:33,093 --> 00:49:36,849
Scott: How come they weren't able to locate a giant ship on their own planet?

828
00:49:37,971 --> 00:49:40,110
Rym: That's kind of revealed and complicated.

829
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:41,710
Scott: Does it have a cloaking device?

830
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:47,015
Rym: I'm not going to explain to you the deal with cloaking devices in Star Trek because there's a lot.

831
00:49:47,035 --> 00:49:48,430
Scott: Pretty sure only bad guys have them.

832
00:49:49,371 --> 00:49:52,809
Rym: That's actually low key kind of true for complicated reasons.

833
00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:54,233
Scott: That's right.

834
00:49:54,253 --> 00:49:54,697
Scott: I know.

835
00:49:54,817 --> 00:49:56,410
Scott: I know there's bare minimums.

836
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:56,953
Scott: I'm a nerd.

837
00:49:57,134 --> 00:49:59,610
Scott: Even though I don't like Star Trek and have watched almost none.

838
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:09,630
Rym: So the deal is I know that to end the war in the old Star Trek, only the bad guys that had cloaking devices, the Federation could easily develop this technology.

839
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:18,790
Rym: And to end those wars, the Federation basically signed a treaty where they agreed they would never research or use cloaking technology under any circumstances ever.

840
00:50:20,536 --> 00:50:21,290
Rym: They're just like our ships.

841
00:50:21,792 --> 00:50:22,075
Scott: I didn't.

842
00:50:22,176 --> 00:50:23,689
Scott: I didn't know that there was a reason for it.

843
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:36,590
Rym: There is a canonical reason for it because it is a plot point in one of the Star Treks, Deep Space Nine, because the Romulans give give the Federation permission to use one ship with a cloaking device for complicated reasons.

844
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:37,972
Rym: Anyway, I digress.

845
00:50:38,534 --> 00:50:44,571
Rym: So the show really is almost like a kid's introduction to Star Trek.

846
00:50:45,134 --> 00:50:54,010
Rym: It's almost like imagine if there's a kid in the real world today who's like twelve, ten, maybe eight, and you want to introduce them to Star Trek.

847
00:50:54,610 --> 00:50:57,742
Rym: This show kind of almost walks a kid through.

848
00:50:58,083 --> 00:51:01,210
Rym: what's the deal with Star Trek, but is also a good kid's show.

849
00:51:01,371 --> 00:51:05,090
Rym: I would say this is absolutely a show aimed at kids for kids.

850
00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:06,013
Rym: Good for kids.

851
00:51:06,536 --> 00:51:08,044
Rym: It's very Star Wars like.

852
00:51:08,185 --> 00:51:08,989
Rym: it's super fun.

853
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:18,090
Scott: Well, I mean, it's interesting that I just talked about Gundam, because at least the part about kids finding a powerful technology is a very Gundam thing.

854
00:51:18,231 --> 00:51:18,431
Scott: Right.

855
00:51:18,472 --> 00:51:25,989
Scott: Just instead of one kid finding one robot and becoming the best pilot of it, it's a group of kids finding a whole ship and becoming the crew.

856
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:26,571
Rym: Yep.

857
00:51:27,013 --> 00:51:30,450
Rym: And they escape with this ship and shenanigans in space ensue.

858
00:51:30,531 --> 00:51:31,969
Rym: And the bad guys are trying to chase them.

859
00:51:32,692 --> 00:51:34,570
Rym: And I'm not going to spoil anything that happens.

860
00:51:35,151 --> 00:51:47,469
Rym: But for Star Trek nerds, it's interesting because until the last episode, you don't really know when this is set because it feels like it's set way after most of the Star Trek most people have ever watched.

861
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:50,210
Rym: And it is set after a lot of Star Trek.

862
00:51:50,692 --> 00:51:53,649
Rym: But if you don't know anything about Star Trek, it's just a sci fi story.

863
00:51:53,689 --> 00:51:57,269
Rym: that's actually pretty compelling and pretty well done and good for kids.

864
00:51:58,451 --> 00:52:07,750
Scott: I just want to say we can end the show, but, you know, the trope of kids find, acquire powerful thing, magic, technology, objects, whatever.

865
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:08,598
Rym: It's a good genre.

866
00:52:08,618 --> 00:52:08,780
Rym: Right.

867
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:10,860
Scott: It's like that's a good genre.

868
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:11,969
Scott: It's been done a million times.

869
00:52:12,251 --> 00:52:12,491
Scott: Right.

870
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:20,784
Scott: We've also occasionally seen the adjacent one of two different groups of kids or two kids.

871
00:52:21,128 --> 00:52:21,310
Scott: Right.

872
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:26,290
Scott: Both acquire some kind of MacGuffin technology magic at the same time.

873
00:52:26,351 --> 00:52:27,790
Scott: And one good one's good and one's evil.

874
00:52:27,911 --> 00:52:28,478
Scott: We've seen that.

875
00:52:28,661 --> 00:52:28,985
Rym: Yeah.

876
00:52:29,026 --> 00:52:29,229
Rym: Right.

877
00:52:30,151 --> 00:52:37,096
Scott: What I haven't seen is anyone go over to write three or four, not kids in the same group.

878
00:52:37,177 --> 00:52:37,747
Scott: I've seen that.

879
00:52:37,828 --> 00:52:37,930
Scott: Right.

880
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:46,809
Scott: But I'm saying like three or four or more different groups of kids all find powerful things at the same time.

881
00:52:47,232 --> 00:52:48,510
Rym: Isn't that just Pokemon?

882
00:52:51,272 --> 00:52:53,970
Scott: No, because the Pokemon is about the one kid who's the champ.

883
00:52:54,190 --> 00:52:55,429
Scott: Everyone else is just normal Pokemon.

884
00:52:57,253 --> 00:52:59,080
Scott: It's not like you ever see.

885
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:08,949
Scott: in Pokemon, you never have a situation where like five different ashes are out there all catching different legendaries who all show up at the Pokemon, you know, league at the same time.

886
00:53:09,415 --> 00:53:09,598
Scott: Right.

887
00:53:09,639 --> 00:53:10,269
Scott: You don't see that.

888
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:12,510
Scott: It's one person who's catching the legendaries.

889
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:13,257
Rym: You know what's funny?

890
00:53:13,317 --> 00:53:14,750
Rym: Even the isekai shows tend to have this.

891
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:18,029
Rym: You often like for Shiggy Yugi did this even go all the way back.

892
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:22,150
Rym: Multiple people get transported to the magical world or the sci-fi world.

893
00:53:22,350 --> 00:53:22,956
Rym: But that's together.

894
00:53:23,017 --> 00:53:24,310
Scott: That's like, you know, El Hazzard.

895
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:25,150
Scott: They go together.

896
00:53:25,331 --> 00:53:26,194
Rym: But they go together.

897
00:53:26,234 --> 00:53:31,850
Rym: But you almost always some of them end up like on the evil side and some of them end up on the good side.

898
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:32,395
Scott: El Hazzard.

899
00:53:32,456 --> 00:53:32,659
Scott: Right.

900
00:53:32,699 --> 00:53:33,429
Scott: He's got the bug room.

901
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:33,855
Scott: One guy.

902
00:53:34,038 --> 00:53:34,730
Scott: It's two groups.

903
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:34,952
Scott: Right.

904
00:53:34,972 --> 00:53:36,049
Scott: The good ones and the bad ones.

905
00:53:36,151 --> 00:53:37,828
Scott: But there wasn't a three a three way.

906
00:53:38,192 --> 00:53:38,638
Scott: Yeah.

907
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:39,489
Scott: Or a four way.

908
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:41,536
Rym: I feel like the more complex.

909
00:53:41,736 --> 00:53:45,252
Scott: interesting is occasionally you see a little less black and white.

910
00:53:45,373 --> 00:53:46,970
Rym: I think you occasionally see the three way.

911
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:48,143
Rym: But the three was usually like.

912
00:53:48,870 --> 00:53:49,910
Scott: Give me an example of the three way.

913
00:53:50,090 --> 00:53:52,079
Rym: So you see some of those less.

914
00:53:52,139 --> 00:53:54,670
Scott: one example, one show, one book, one movie, one.

915
00:53:54,710 --> 00:53:56,087
Rym: So the trope would be it.

916
00:53:56,430 --> 00:53:57,577
Rym: I think it boils down to.

917
00:53:57,657 --> 00:54:00,750
Rym: you might have an individual character, but I think it was a good specific example.

918
00:54:01,111 --> 00:54:06,753
Rym: That isn't just like a random El Hazzard character where you've got the typical two factions.

919
00:54:07,215 --> 00:54:10,590
Rym: But then there's one character who's like, fuck all this.

920
00:54:10,670 --> 00:54:11,540
Rym: I don't care about any of this.

921
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:12,470
Rym: I'm just doing my own thing.

922
00:54:12,972 --> 00:54:16,030
Rym: And they're a side character, but they never are involved in the real plot.

923
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:19,730
Scott: Yeah, I'm talking main main characters, right?

924
00:54:20,552 --> 00:54:20,855
Rym: Yeah.

925
00:54:21,038 --> 00:54:21,827
Rym: Yeah, I don't know.

00:54:22,451 --> 00:54:39,490
Rym: But I would say if you want to introduce kids to Star Trek, Prodigy is like the gateway show to get a kid interested in Star Trek at all, because it kind of over the course of the show teaches you what's the deal with Star Trek and what's the deal with the Federation in a pretty interesting way.

927
00:54:39,971 --> 00:54:40,835
Rym: But it is a kid's show.

928
00:54:40,875 --> 00:54:47,189
Rym: It's not like the grim, dark nonsense of Picard or the typical Star Trek fare of what most Star Treks are like.

929
00:54:53,481 --> 00:54:55,640
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

930
00:54:55,781 --> 00:55:00,819
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

931
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:06,202
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion, news and more.

932
00:55:06,423 --> 00:55:13,860
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows, Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

934
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:21,620
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

935
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:24,820
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

936
00:55:25,562 --> 00:55:35,240
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights are Alan Joyce, Linky G, Dread Lily Tenebrae, a bunch of people who really don't want me to say their names.

937
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:37,260
Rym: Casecare makes music.

938
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:44,006
Rym: Chris Haddad, Chris Reimer, Clinton Walton, Dex Finn, Rebecca Dunn, Sam Erickson, Sherwin Von Horl.

939
00:55:44,309 --> 00:55:45,420
Rym: Stop all the downloading.

940
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,980
Rym: The next station is Finch West, Finch West Station.

941
00:55:49,521 --> 00:55:54,380
Rym: And many, many people whose names I will not say because they have correctly chosen to give us like a dollar.

942
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,080
Rym: So anyway, yeah, we're still back.

943
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:57,950
Rym: I got nothing new.

944
00:55:58,031 --> 00:55:58,540
Rym: I'm really hungry.

945
00:55:58,721 --> 00:56:01,640
Rym: So I'm just going to end this on a song that you may recognize.

946
00:56:37,701 --> 00:56:39,919
Scott: You were first to the match called the Reindeer Girls.

947
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:44,550
Rym: Oh, something.
