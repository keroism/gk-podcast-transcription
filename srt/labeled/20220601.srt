1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,109
Rym: It's Wednesday, June 1st, 2022.

2
00:00:10,109 --> 00:00:10,270
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,406 --> 00:00:13,980
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,006
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight.

5
00:00:16,085 --> 00:00:20,240
Rym: It's an anime, manga, comics, cartoons, news, round up!

6
00:00:23,662 --> 00:00:24,677
Rym: Let's do this.

7
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:30,318
Scott: No one's watching any animes or reading any comics these days, so...

8
00:00:31,243 --> 00:00:32,939
Rym: I am watching a lot of cartoons.

9
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,611
Rym: I'm watching The Owl House, Lower Decks.

10
00:00:35,631 --> 00:00:37,260
Rym: Season 2 is going to come out soon again.

11
00:00:38,022 --> 00:00:39,759
Rym: There's Season 3, I guess, at this point.

12
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,780
Rym: I actually, of all things, I've started watching Bob's Burgers and I've watched a bunch of it.

13
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,620
Rym: I've got a lot to say about it now that I've seen more than, like, handfuls and snippets of it.

14
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,975
Rym: But I'll get to that in the news because there's a news related to Bob's Burgers.

15
00:00:53,016 --> 00:00:53,960
Rym: that is timely.

16
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:59,740
Rym: But I guess before we get into the news round up, you know, we'll still do things of the day and everything else.

17
00:01:00,402 --> 00:01:07,080
Rym: And the only thing I can talk about that's happened to me is the Stanley Cup somehow continuing for us.

18
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,920
Scott: So the listener is going to have to hear from us about ice hockey in June.

19
00:01:13,341 --> 00:01:20,219
Rym: I appreciate the one listener who was like, "You guys really didn't talk a lot about the hockey even when the playoffs were

20
00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:20,640
Rym: happening.".

21
00:01:21,241 --> 00:01:22,686
Rym: And then suddenly you're talked about a lot.

22
00:01:22,806 --> 00:01:33,040
Rym: It's like, yeah, I cannot express how excited I am that the Rangers are this far because no universe did I expect this or even, like, hoped that hard for this.

23
00:01:33,482 --> 00:01:35,140
Rym: I was just happy to make it to the playoffs.

24
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,160
Scott: Right, expectations have already been exceeded, right?

25
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:43,920
Scott: It's like, you know, I went to Thanksgiving dinner, I'm full, we already even ate pie, like, it's over.

26
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:49,280
Scott: Someone comes in with, like, a whole other whole ass turkey and it's just like, what the fuuck.

27
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,928
Rym: Yup.

28
00:01:51,693 --> 00:01:53,000
Rym: At this point anything can happen.

29
00:01:53,281 --> 00:02:00,920
Rym: Like, playoffs when you get deep, there's only-- basically, what we're seeing now, like, I watched the other game last night, too, which was ridiculous.

30
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,804
Scott: - I watched part of it, yeah.

31
00:02:01,824 --> 00:02:04,560
Rym: - Yeah, I didn't watch the third period, but I should've, I guess.

32
00:02:07,702 --> 00:02:13,340
Rym: So, we're now watching the four best ice hockey teams on earth playing hockey.

33
00:02:13,441 --> 00:02:15,171
Scott: - That's not necessarily true, right?

34
00:02:15,191 --> 00:02:16,780
Rym: - I think that's pretty necessarily true.

35
00:02:17,422 --> 00:02:19,249
Scott: Who would win, right?

36
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:22,120
Scott: You know, I guess last year's Tampa Bay Lightning.

37
00:02:22,321 --> 00:02:25,337
Rym: Oh, the teams that are currently active with current rosters.

38
00:02:25,377 --> 00:02:28,447
Rym: We're not talking about the greatest hockey teams of all time.

39
00:02:28,467 --> 00:02:33,400
Scott: - Or, like, Canada national team from last year.

40
00:02:34,642 --> 00:02:39,705
Rym: - I think any of the four teams in the current Stanley Cup playoffs could beat any national team.

41
00:02:40,167 --> 00:02:48,540
Scott: The problem is-- - If you made just a team of the best players from all of Canada, they couldn't beat an NHL team that has a salary cap?

42
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,146
Rym: - I don't think so.

43
00:02:50,589 --> 00:02:52,540
Scott: Primarily-- - That's not even a question.

44
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,431
Scott: The Canadian team would blow them out.

45
00:02:54,451 --> 00:02:55,880
Rym: - I don't think so, actually.

46
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,100
Rym: Because that team does not exist as the same cohesive unit in the same way?

47
00:03:00,961 --> 00:03:07,490
Rym: Long enough that-- I mean, it's moot, because we can't test this, because any NHL team has, like, people from these other teams.

48
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:15,540
Scott: - Do you think the Colorado Avalanche from this year could beat the Eastern Conference All-Star team from this year?

49
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,200
Rym: - Honestly, Conference All-Star teams I don't think are actually that great.

50
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,500
Rym: But to have that-- this should be a Tuesday show, actually.

51
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:29,869
Rym: I have a lot to say, and I was about to say way too much and make the show go on way too long about hockey.

52
00:03:30,512 --> 00:03:32,120
Rym: Let's have that conversation not a Tuesday.

53
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,312
Scott: - The point is that there's only four hockey teams left.

54
00:03:35,412 --> 00:03:40,676
Scott: There is exactly one hockey game every night for the next couple, few weeks.

55
00:03:40,696 --> 00:03:42,361
Scott: - But the funny thing-- - 8 p.m.

56
00:03:42,482 --> 00:03:43,747
Scott: Eastern New York time.

57
00:03:43,767 --> 00:03:47,967
Scott: - So, based on, you know, the NHL-- - And half of them involve us.

58
00:03:47,987 --> 00:03:53,299
Rym: - The last thing I'll say, the NHL, for those of you who don't pay attention to ice hockey, what I'll say that's relevant is this.

59
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:57,160
Rym: It's broken up in divisions, and those divisions are part of conferences.

60
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,186
Rym: There are two conferences.

61
00:03:58,669 --> 00:04:02,413
Rym: Roughly, it's the Eastern United States and the Western United States.

62
00:04:02,433 --> 00:04:03,460
Rym: - Also Canada.

63
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:11,049
Rym: - Yeah, also Canada, which this year actually matters, unlike previous, relatively recent Stanley Cup playoffs.

64
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:24,960
Rym: But right now we're in a situation where, generally speaking, one of those conferences has very high-scoring games, and one of those conferences has shockingly low-scoring games.

65
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:40,079
Rym: So the Stanley Cup final might be a team that can easily score six or seven goals in a game versus a team that has a goalie who could make enough saves to make that game turn into a one or two goal game.

66
00:04:41,362 --> 00:04:51,920
Scott: - Yep, but it means that right now we're not in the finals, we're in the conference finals, the semi-finals, if you will, and right now you have two teams that score a bunch fighting against each other.

67
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:59,720
Scott: So two unstoppable forces opposing each other, and then on the other side you have two immovable objects opposing each other.

68
00:04:59,941 --> 00:05:01,249
Rym: The Rangers and the Tampa Bay Lightning.

69
00:05:01,269 --> 00:05:09,600
Scott: - You're gonna have the stronger of the two unstoppable forces against the stronger of the two immovable objects in the final battle.

70
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:22,120
Rym: - This is not just because the Rangers are in the conference finals, which even they didn't think they'd get this far because they had a trade they made where they have to give up a better draft pick if they make it this far.

71
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:28,120
Scott: - Yeah, but they interviewed Drury, the GM, the World Series champion Chris Drury.

72
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,759
Scott: In the interview they were like, "Oh, you had to give up the draft

73
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:31,880
Scott: pick.".

74
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,107
Scott: He's like, "Yeah, okay, whatever.

75
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,717
Scott: I'm okay with

76
00:05:34,757 --> 00:05:34,999
Scott: that.".

77
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,428
Rym: - Well, think about it.

78
00:05:36,488 --> 00:05:40,140
Rym: If you make that trade, your thinking is, "There's no way we're making the conference finals.

79
00:05:40,401 --> 00:05:41,898
Rym: And if we do, I don't give a fuck how we got

80
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:42,040
Rym: here.".

81
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,251
Scott: - That's right.

82
00:05:44,272 --> 00:05:45,400
Scott: You made it so he doesn't give a fuck.

83
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,600
Rym: - But this is one of the better playoffs I've seen in a long, long time.

84
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:55,660
Rym: Not just because the Rangers are in it because I watch the playoffs every year, but this has been some really fantastic hockey just across the board.

85
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,040
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

86
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,740
Rym: So my thing of the day is a 15-minute video.

87
00:06:09,122 --> 00:06:10,920
Rym: And this channel is actually really fun.

88
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,879
Rym: It doesn't judge the people who come in.

89
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:14,839
Rym: I want to get back to that.

90
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:17,380
Rym: It's called Just Rolled In.

91
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,340
Rym: And the conceit is, this is a mechanic and a car just rolled into the shop.

92
00:06:22,861 --> 00:06:25,880
Rym: And they take a look at the car to figure out what's wrong with it.

93
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:26,876
Rym: It just rolled in.

94
00:06:27,683 --> 00:06:39,080
Rym: And this channel has one, like they have a bunch of different series, but within the channel, the one series that I'm linking to, and this is a best of from 2021 to really seal the deal, is the Customer States series.

95
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,908
Rym: Meaning the car rolled in and the customer says, "This is why I'm

96
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:45,130
Rym: here.".

97
00:06:45,962 --> 00:06:49,380
Rym: And then it cuts to what is actually wrong with the car.

98
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:51,600
Rym: Sometimes the customer is right.

99
00:06:52,001 --> 00:06:53,200
Rym: Sometimes the customer is wrong.

100
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:55,598
Rym: Sometimes the customer says, "I think I have a flat

101
00:06:55,658 --> 00:06:55,880
Rym: tire."

102
00:06:56,262 --> 00:06:58,896
Rym: And the camera zooms back to, "The tire is

103
00:06:58,976 --> 00:06:59,398
Rym: gone.".

104
00:07:00,282 --> 00:07:06,400
Rym: There is clearly a smoldering wreck of what used to be the axle under the car.

105
00:07:06,842 --> 00:07:10,159
Rym: And the person thinks they just need a new tire and they have not gotten out of the car yet.

106
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,798
Rym: It's all sorts of stuff like that.

107
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:26,417
Rym: But the main reason I'm making this my thing of the day is that, if you were, say, a computer professional, and someone comes to you with an extremely obvious problem, "Hey, my computer stopped

108
00:07:26,457 --> 00:07:26,740
Rym: working.".

109
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,697
Rym: And you turn it on and you're like, "Wow, yeah, your hard drive is completely

110
00:07:30,777 --> 00:07:30,998
Rym: full.".

111
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,071
Rym: And you're like, "Completely full.

112
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:34,239
Rym: Actually completely

113
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:34,360
Rym: full.".

114
00:07:35,662 --> 00:07:40,940
Rym: That's obvious to a computer person, but it's clearly not that obvious to people who don't know a lot about computers.

115
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:47,419
Rym: Similarly, you bring a car in, a mechanic takes one look at it, and they're like, "Just look at

116
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:47,500
Rym: it.".

117
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:52,580
Rym: And you're like, "Oh, I know exactly what's wrong, but me, who knows very little about cars, I have no idea.

118
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,056
Rym: I brought my car to the expert because I need

119
00:07:54,096 --> 00:07:54,238
Rym: help.".

120
00:07:54,962 --> 00:08:05,220
Rym: So part of the reason I made this my thing of the day is, if you're a computery person out there, remember that most people, none of this stuff is obvious to them at all.

121
00:08:07,101 --> 00:08:16,240
Rym: And this video is how car people feel when often computer people who know nothing about cars bring their car into the shop with something obviously wrong.

122
00:08:16,941 --> 00:08:40,019
Rym: But I actually want to point out something far deeper in this video, because despite not knowing a lot about cars, if you watch this video, a lot of the problems are extremely obvious, even to someone who has never seen a car in their life, if they just look at their own car and just think, "Should it look like that for maybe 10 or 15

123
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:40,280
Rym: seconds?".

124
00:08:41,182 --> 00:08:47,900
Rym: And my advice to all of you, if you feel like you struggle with computers, is that computer problems are also that way.

125
00:08:48,301 --> 00:08:59,880
Rym: When your computer is not working 99% of the time, your computer will actually tell you exactly what is wrong, and all you have to do is just click around and look at what the computer's telling you.

126
00:09:02,222 --> 00:09:04,139
Scott: People don't read, stop, think.

127
00:09:05,302 --> 00:09:06,997
Rym: One of these is like, "My car's making a weird

128
00:09:07,038 --> 00:09:07,280
Rym: noise.".

129
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,178
Rym: They open the hood, truck, it's literally full of walnuts that a squirrel must have put in there.

130
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,819
Rym: Like, didn't just open the hood?

131
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,739
Rym: Take a look before you brought it into the mechanic with a tow truck.

132
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,739
Scott: They don't know how to open the hood.

133
00:09:21,682 --> 00:09:24,700
Rym: There's a giant button that has a picture of a hood.

134
00:09:25,242 --> 00:09:27,000
Scott: People are scared to do that, right?

135
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,899
Scott: People are scared to touch their computers.

136
00:09:30,642 --> 00:09:42,260
Rym: I have a friend who, in living memory, like in the last 10 years, I'm being suitably vague about this in case that person listens to the show, they asked for help with their computer and I was willing to check it out.

137
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:48,500
Rym: And the problem ended up being they had two hard drives and the second hard drive just wasn't plugged into anything.

138
00:09:48,804 --> 00:09:49,778
Rym: It was installed in the case.

139
00:09:50,682 --> 00:09:53,380
Rym: at no point was it plugged into the motherboard or a power supply or anything.

140
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,339
Rym: It was just plugged into the case and they ran out of hard drive space.

141
00:09:58,421 --> 00:09:58,700
Scott: Okay.

142
00:10:00,281 --> 00:10:03,079
Rym: So I plugged the computer, I plugged the hard drive in and fixed it.

143
00:10:04,508 --> 00:10:04,720
Rym: Okay.

144
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:05,800
Rym: Anyway, what do you got?

145
00:10:07,641 --> 00:10:08,320
Scott: News wise?

146
00:10:08,581 --> 00:10:09,058
Rym: Thing of the day.

147
00:10:09,922 --> 00:10:11,500
Scott: Oh, you're jumping straight to thing of the day?

148
00:10:11,701 --> 00:10:13,060
Rym: I just, we already did things.

149
00:10:13,664 --> 00:10:14,598
Scott: This was my thing of the day.

150
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,340
Scott: Very related to your thing of the day.

151
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:20,820
Scott: I also have a fixing things thing of the day.

152
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,999
Scott: I found this YouTube channel.

153
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:27,240
Scott: This guy's called, I guess his name is Steve, but his YouTube channel is Stiz Stix Fix.

154
00:10:28,263 --> 00:10:30,620
Scott: And I like it cause he's not a YouTube shouty guy.

155
00:10:30,721 --> 00:10:32,379
Scott: He's just a quiet YouTube guy.

156
00:10:33,361 --> 00:10:38,220
Scott: And what's interesting is that usually when you go to YouTube guys, right?

157
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:43,180
Scott: You know, you're usually finding someone who's like an expert on something, right?

158
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:47,680
Scott: And you're like, or like a extreme enthusiast about something, you know?

159
00:10:47,841 --> 00:10:52,940
Scott: And it's like, this guy is actually not an extreme expert, right?

160
00:10:54,642 --> 00:11:03,614
Scott: He is here in these, you know, this particular, he does a few different video series, but his best one, which I'm linking to the playlist is can I fix it?

161
00:11:04,036 --> 00:11:17,259
Scott: in which he attempts to fix a purchases, you know, broken and need of repair electronic devices, mostly from eBay and other places, mostly eBay, and then attempts to fix them.

162
00:11:17,964 --> 00:11:20,220
Scott: With soldering iron, you know, whatever.

163
00:11:21,364 --> 00:11:23,220
Scott: And does he know about electronics?

164
00:11:23,601 --> 00:11:34,259
Scott: Like, yes, but does he know as like, he doesn't know that much more than me about electronics and he definitely doesn't know as much about electronics as like big Clive, who really is like expert, right?

165
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,260
Rym: Oh, I just watched a really good big Clive last night.

166
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,159
Rym: So yeah.

167
00:11:38,582 --> 00:11:41,240
Scott: And it's like, how good is he at soldering?

168
00:11:41,943 --> 00:11:43,640
Scott: Better than me, but not great.

169
00:11:44,785 --> 00:11:48,560
Scott: How much does he know about computer stuff and digital logic?

170
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,214
Scott: Less than me, right?

171
00:11:52,021 --> 00:11:57,520
Scott: So this guy doesn't know really, you know, he's not extremely technologically advanced.

172
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,880
Scott: He's not like a doofus, right?

173
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,360
Scott: But it's like, you know, he's not like, you know, one of those S tier people who fucking, you know, blows you away with their knowledge yet.

174
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:10,740
Scott: Yet he has videos where he goes.

175
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:15,640
Scott: He buys five broken Game Boy games on eBay, right?

176
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,300
Scott: Like, and he puts them in a Game Boy and sure enough, none of them work.

177
00:12:20,022 --> 00:12:20,578
Scott: And you know what?

178
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,720
Scott: With his soldering iron, he fixes original Game Boy cartridges and then they work.

179
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:36,200
Scott: And it's like, when they actually work, it's sort of like, you know, watching the video, it's like he and you, the viewer, get like this great joy of like, oh my God.

180
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,277
Scott: That was like, it was actually broken, like broken, broken.

181
00:12:40,022 --> 00:12:42,779
Scott: You know, sometimes he gets one that just needs some cleaning and then it works.

182
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,099
Scott: But, you know, a lot of the times when that happens, he won't make a video.

183
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:53,080
Scott: He'll be like, um, but it's like, he'll be broken Sega Genesis, broken Neo Geo pocket.

184
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:57,980
Scott: That one, he just kept going at it and like, it fucking worked eventually.

185
00:12:58,183 --> 00:12:59,180
Scott: It's like, holy shit.

186
00:12:59,341 --> 00:13:00,386
Scott: It's like, he didn't know.

187
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:05,739
Scott: this guy doesn't know anything about the schematic of the Neo Geo pocket, how it works really, you know, anything.

188
00:13:06,424 --> 00:13:09,080
Scott: He just keeps, he opens it up and he repairs it.

189
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:13,720
Scott: Like, you know, a shoemaker would repair a shoe and it's like, and then it works.

190
00:13:14,103 --> 00:13:15,379
Scott: And it's like, holy crap.

191
00:13:16,685 --> 00:13:17,399
Scott: It's really awesome.

192
00:13:17,502 --> 00:13:18,158
Scott: And a lot of fun.

193
00:13:18,542 --> 00:13:21,859
Scott: It makes you want to go on eBay and buy broken stuff and try to fix it.

194
00:13:22,281 --> 00:13:27,460
Scott: I resisted the urge to do that because what the fuck am I going to do with the shit?

195
00:13:27,582 --> 00:13:28,579
Scott: Even if I fix it, what?

196
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,820
Scott: Sell it for actually, it's funny.

197
00:13:31,021 --> 00:13:40,920
Rym: This is your thing of the day, because, uh, one of the, the Torsier led light that I bought like seven years ago failed in a way where it started flickering.

198
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:44,139
Rym: And I think I can fix it and I'm actually going to try and fix it.

199
00:13:44,762 --> 00:13:45,472
Scott: You probably could do.

200
00:13:46,561 --> 00:13:49,160
Rym: Yeah, it's not that, it's not that complicated of a device.

201
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:58,158
Scott: And I looked into, but it's, it's a lot more fun though, to see like, you know, an old iPod come back to Sega Genesis, come back to life, then a lamp come back to life.

202
00:13:58,702 --> 00:13:58,809
Rym: Yeah.

203
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:03,358
Rym: But it'll mean that I, I would rather have continued to have this lamp than not have this lamp.

204
00:14:03,682 --> 00:14:05,719
Rym: And I'd rather not buy another a hundred dollars lamp.

205
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:12,900
Rym: So in the better moment, the geek tonight's book club book, which I expect we'll just do the show on Thursday.

206
00:14:13,043 --> 00:14:13,960
Rym: I don't see any reason why not.

207
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,960
Rym: So next Thursday, nine Fox gambit, we will talk about the books.

208
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:27,600
Rym: If you didn't start reading it yet, I suggest you read it, learn all about calendars and your tenant, open up your calendar and put it in the entry right for next Thursday.

209
00:14:27,722 --> 00:14:29,220
Scott: Read this book by next Thursday.

210
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,200
Rym: You could easily read this book by the course.

211
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,479
Scott: The listener wanted us to read this book so badly.

212
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,080
Scott: They've definitely read it already, right?

213
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,179
Scott: They read it before I read it.

214
00:14:36,421 --> 00:14:37,040
Scott: You can reread it.

215
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,133
Rym: It's a short read, but, uh, it's not that sure.

216
00:14:40,173 --> 00:14:47,699
Rym: if I, if I have to entice you further, cause you know, I always don't, like, I try not to say, we both try to not say a ton about the book until we actually do the book club show.

217
00:14:48,181 --> 00:14:57,159
Rym: And I know I keep saying that it's about violent calendars or calendar related violence, but I guess I should point out that it also involves you tenant duels.

218
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:59,220
Scott: Oh yeah.

219
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:05,880
Rym: There's a couple of, there's a couple of tenant duels and you might be thinking, oh, clearly now they're, they're pretty much just fucking new tenant duels.

220
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:06,978
Rym: And when you read the book, you'll see.

221
00:15:07,643 --> 00:15:09,479
Rym: And that doesn't even happen that late in the book.

222
00:15:10,261 --> 00:15:14,140
Scott: So there's a, there's a, I mean, I think there's two, right?

223
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,080
Scott: If I remember it, there's like an early one.

224
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:22,759
Rym: There's a really early one where she duels that, uh, like the one commander, uh, like the commander within the swarm.

225
00:15:23,263 --> 00:15:25,520
Scott: And then there's the, anyway, I think there's a late one.

226
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,274
Rym: Yeah.

227
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,199
Scott: There's a, it might be three.

228
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,320
Rym: I think anyway, uh, this book's real good.

229
00:15:31,702 --> 00:15:34,858
Rym: If you like the culture books, you'll probably like this and vice versa is the other thing else.

230
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,854
Scott: Did they both have named spaceships?

231
00:15:38,342 --> 00:15:40,260
Rym: Also little droid guys who are great.

232
00:15:40,582 --> 00:15:41,620
Rym: I love the little servitors.

233
00:15:42,302 --> 00:15:43,619
Rym: Everything about the servitors is great.

234
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:44,950
Scott: Yep.

235
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:52,377
Rym: So yeah, otherwise, uh, websites coming along, uh, we're not going to be at any cons for awhile.

236
00:15:53,942 --> 00:15:55,039
Rym: Uh, what else can I say?

237
00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:04,420
Rym: So we will eventually, I guess we should tell us what anime that is easily available that we should review and we'll just watch four episodes of it.

238
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,019
Rym: Hard mode.

239
00:16:05,501 --> 00:16:08,380
Scott: I've unsubscribed from, uh, all streaming services.

240
00:16:08,481 --> 00:16:10,439
Scott: So I might have to turn one back on or something.

241
00:16:10,941 --> 00:16:15,697
Rym: I'm, I'm still on Netflix because Netflix actually has the anime I'm watching right now.

242
00:16:15,881 --> 00:16:18,459
Rym: And the cartoons, it basically has everything I'm watching right now.

243
00:16:19,602 --> 00:16:22,495
Scott: I watched, I watched so much Netflix and then I was like, there's nothing.

244
00:16:22,596 --> 00:16:24,880
Scott: I turn on Netflix, scroll through it, watch nothing.

245
00:16:26,003 --> 00:16:32,019
Rym: You could resubscribe to Netflix just to watch orbital children and arcane, and then you can unsubscribe.

246
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,600
Rym: They're both like some of the best cartoons.

247
00:16:35,081 --> 00:16:36,139
Scott: One month of Netflix is what?

248
00:16:36,139 --> 00:16:36,839
Scott: 15 bucks.

249
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:37,200
Rym: Yeah.

250
00:16:37,281 --> 00:16:37,879
Rym: That'd be worth it.

251
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,360
Rym: That's less than an anime DVD.

252
00:16:40,607 --> 00:16:41,299
Scott: I guess that's true.

253
00:16:41,741 --> 00:16:45,320
Rym: Anyway, but those shows are both up your alley in a huge way.

254
00:16:46,364 --> 00:16:53,500
Scott: You know, it's just not the time like right at this moment for me to, you know, I've been, I've been watching less anime and reading less manga over time.

255
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,120
Rym: I've been watching a lot of cartoons, but not cartoon Scott's watching.

256
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,820
Scott: But I suspect in the near future, right?

257
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,900
Scott: Once the website and the hockey are out of the way in the summertime, right?

258
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,999
Scott: If I go into the beach or whatever, when the weather's fine, it's like, I'm going to have some more free time coming up real soon.

259
00:17:12,361 --> 00:17:15,898
Scott: So I'll have a more, more watching will occur.

260
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,940
Rym: We'll also have to do a final thoughts on Chainsaw Man.

261
00:17:19,346 --> 00:17:19,839
Scott: Oh, that's true.

262
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,440
Scott: We got to wait for the last volume is coming out this month.

263
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:25,339
Rym: I believe that'll be an easy show that we'll definitely do.

264
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,816
Rym: Cause I got some thoughts already.

265
00:17:29,305 --> 00:17:34,131
Rym: Chainsaw Man is more topical than many of you who don't know anything about it will expect it to be.

266
00:17:37,021 --> 00:17:44,420
Rym: So it's an anime, manga, comics, cartoons, whatever news round up because we didn't have a topic and we haven't done these that often.

267
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,879
Rym: We've done it like once or twice ever.

268
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:50,500
Rym: So I want to point out just saying the listener said, and I'm quoting directly.

269
00:17:50,921 --> 00:17:53,760
Scott: I think the last volume might've just come out.

270
00:17:54,303 --> 00:17:54,820
Rym: I got to catch up.

271
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,239
Rym: I'm actually not at the second of an ultimate volume yet.

272
00:17:59,167 --> 00:18:00,120
Scott: I think it's 11.

273
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:00,216
Scott: Yeah.

274
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:00,777
Scott: Oh no.

275
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,254
Scott: June 7th, June 7th.

276
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,079
Rym: So I'm going to quote the listener from the stream right now.

277
00:18:05,661 --> 00:18:10,860
Rym: I hope this unexpected Scott generosity doesn't mean the tech news roundup is delayed longer.

278
00:18:12,322 --> 00:18:16,260
Rym: The tech news roundup listener loves the tech news roundups.

279
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:16,758
Rym: Just saying.

280
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,380
Scott: Well, listener, I got bad news for you is that the tech news roundup occurred twice last year with the tech news roundup.

281
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,940
Scott: The quota of tech news roundups is once every 12 months.

282
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:27,839
Scott: Just quit for better.

283
00:18:28,742 --> 00:18:31,440
Scott: Two of them happened three months apart from each other.

284
00:18:31,602 --> 00:18:33,140
Scott: So you have to wait.

285
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:42,120
Scott: I think I have on the calendar marked somewhere like when the, you know, the sort of, uh, you have a crude enough time for another tech news round.

286
00:18:42,361 --> 00:18:43,740
Rym: I say we should do them quarterly.

287
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:45,693
Scott: Well, too bad.

288
00:18:47,201 --> 00:18:47,843
Scott: Come up with better.

289
00:18:47,863 --> 00:18:53,440
Rym: Monday show ideas in anime, manga, comics, animation, cartoon news.

290
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,779
Rym: There is a bunch of stuff to talk about.

291
00:18:54,900 --> 00:19:11,119
Rym: I want to start with this drops right after we did our last Wednesday show when we were struggling to find news, which is really funny, but, uh, we knew there was a new or say at coming, you know, the LOM anime, uh, honestly, one of my favorite shows, like of all time in terms of just anime.

292
00:19:11,963 --> 00:19:15,000
Scott: I think we did an episode on the first manga volume, right?

293
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:15,777
Rym: Pretty sure we did.

294
00:19:16,561 --> 00:19:21,996
Rym: Uh, but we knew a new one was coming right after we recorded GeekNights a couple of weeks ago.

295
00:19:23,001 --> 00:19:33,940
Rym: The trailer for the new LOM anime drops and it appears to be not a Sailor Moon Crystal situation, but a, this is going to be good situation.

296
00:19:34,244 --> 00:19:35,500
Rym: The animation looks fantastic.

297
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,240
Rym: The character designs look fantastic.

298
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:50,320
Rym: The, the, the sad, the song that they play directly evokes the original shows songs, but also they went nuts on the color and it looks beautiful.

299
00:19:51,384 --> 00:19:52,180
Scott: That's just a trailer.

300
00:19:52,548 --> 00:19:52,700
Scott: It is.

301
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,540
Scott: You can't, you can't believe the whole thing is.

302
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,140
Rym: I want to point out there was not a trailer for Sailor Moon Crystal.

303
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:02,279
Scott: Well, did tell him when crystal was a, was a hack or hack rush job.

304
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:02,548
Scott: Yeah.

305
00:20:03,521 --> 00:20:08,420
Scott: Anyway, um, but yeah, I've known this trend is really picking up lately, right?

306
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,340
Scott: It's like you look at say the United States cartoon universe, right?

307
00:20:12,601 --> 00:20:16,900
Scott: And there have always, you know, there were properties that came into existence, right?

308
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,540
Scott: You know, think about really old stuff, say Alvin and the chipmunks.

309
00:20:20,601 --> 00:20:21,700
Scott: That's super old, right?

310
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:32,060
Scott: You know, sixties like old and that, but when we were kids, it's like, well, there was a different, you know, a remake of Alvin and the chipmunks that was like, you know, the eighties, nineties one, whatever.

311
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,840
Rym: When I was a kid, we had that.

312
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:34,960
Rym: Like that's what I watched.

313
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:38,680
Rym: Also that horrible Alvin and the chipmunks movie that you should never watch.

314
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,318
Rym: Not even, there's no reason to watch it.

315
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,417
Rym: It's warning you all right now.

316
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:48,200
Rym: But we also had a ton of vinyl Alvin and the chipmunk albums from the original Alvin era.

317
00:20:49,001 --> 00:20:51,940
Scott: But the point is, I didn't realize they were different, right?

318
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:55,420
Scott: It's like they keep animating and coming up with intellectual properties.

319
00:20:55,621 --> 00:21:01,859
Scott: And then when they get a hit intellectual property in the United States, they keep bringing it back.

320
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:09,660
Scott: Not, you know, not as like sequels and like more seasons, but as like, it goes away and comes back again.

321
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:14,220
Scott: Transformers goes away, comes back as like, you know, beast transformers goes away.

322
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,300
Scott: It comes back as something else.

323
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:19,598
Rym: It's like a heartbeat in a protocol, like a communications protocol to keep it alive.

324
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:24,979
Scott: So when B test finally ran out, they wait a little bit and then Batman beyond comes out.

325
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,700
Rym: Just like, yeah, we can't, we can't let Batman fall out of the popular consciousness.

326
00:21:29,487 --> 00:21:30,100
Rym: Keep it alive.

327
00:21:30,162 --> 00:21:30,660
Rym: Do something.

328
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,300
Scott: Spider-Man and his amazing friends.

329
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,420
Scott: That's gone.

330
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:33,632
Scott: Okay.

331
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,460
Scott: Well, now we wait.

332
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:35,338
Scott: We ate some years.

333
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:50,120
Scott: Now there's a Spider-Man, you know, cartoon again, you know, just keeps cycling over and over and like even things that were newer more recently, it's like, you know, Oh, there was a powerpuff girls and then it went away and then it came back even though it wasn't sixties old.

334
00:21:50,227 --> 00:21:50,420
Scott: Right.

335
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:56,819
Scott: It's like, you know, as soon as they find something that's a, that's a hit, it goes and it runs out of steam and then they bring it back.

336
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:03,980
Scott: So in anime though, that has not happened really as much, right?

337
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:08,920
Scott: When they have a thing that's a hit, they keep it going nonstop.

338
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:09,879
Rym: There are exceptions.

339
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:10,460
Rym: Of course.

340
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,779
Rym: Sometimes there's the, Oh, we had an OAV.

341
00:22:12,981 --> 00:22:13,498
Rym: It was a hit.

342
00:22:13,741 --> 00:22:16,476
Rym: We'll reboot it as a TV show and milk it.

343
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:17,180
Rym: that happened.

344
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,385
Scott: But it's not, it's not like.

345
00:22:18,405 --> 00:22:21,280
Scott: there's a big gap where it's like, it was a hit thing.

346
00:22:21,422 --> 00:22:22,580
Scott: It goes away and comes back.

347
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:28,460
Scott: The only thing I can think of that's like goes away and comes back is Lupin, which keeps going away and coming back constantly.

348
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:37,420
Rym: Evangelion is a weird case cause it ended and then it came back over the course of an extremely long amount of time.

349
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,340
Scott: It's a more recent thing, right?

350
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,360
Scott: You look at say, Pokemon is always successful.

351
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,199
Scott: It's just, yeah, Pokemon just doesn't stop.

352
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:48,820
Scott: They might completely redo it or, you know, make new seasons, new characters.

353
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:52,640
Rym: But they don't just remake the original season of Pokemon like one.

354
00:22:53,022 --> 00:22:53,178
Scott: Right.

355
00:22:54,084 --> 00:22:57,920
Scott: You know, they might do a Naruto into a Boruto or whatever they're going to do.

356
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:02,140
Scott: But it's like, you know, it's like, I think of a popular older thing.

357
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:05,380
Scott: I guess Gundam keeps going away and coming back.

358
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:09,520
Scott: Also, that's also a franchise they constantly, right.

359
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:15,980
Scott: But it's not like there was some gap where they're like, you know what, let's just stop Gundams for a decade and then come back.

360
00:23:16,129 --> 00:23:16,260
Scott: Right.

361
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,160
Scott: It's like, there's always more Gundams coming, right.

362
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:19,858
Scott: They don't sleep.

363
00:23:20,451 --> 00:23:20,660
Scott: Right.

364
00:23:21,001 --> 00:23:25,560
Scott: But these more recently, we are seeing that pattern.

365
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:30,300
Scott: It's like Ursa Yatsura was a big, long series because it was successful.

366
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,000
Scott: It ended.

367
00:23:31,582 --> 00:23:34,100
Scott: It went to sleep and now it woke up again.

368
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,680
Scott: Sailor Moon was a big, long thing.

369
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,040
Scott: It went to sleep and then it woke up again.

370
00:23:38,454 --> 00:23:38,559
Scott: Right.

371
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:42,560
Scott: We're seeing a lot more of that happening these days.

372
00:23:42,942 --> 00:23:45,579
Scott: And I thought it was, you know, with the Sailor Moons and things like that.

373
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:49,660
Scott: I thought it was stuff with international popularity, you know, Dragon Balls.

374
00:23:49,881 --> 00:23:50,946
Rym: Well, Sailor Moon was also.

375
00:23:50,986 --> 00:23:56,239
Rym: there was something with the anniversary and they wanted to capitalize on it, but there was other stuff going on there.

376
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:01,780
Scott: Ursa Yatsura really does not have the immense international popularity.

377
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:05,900
Scott: Maybe in some not, you know, there's probably some countries where it's big besides Japan.

378
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:13,140
Scott: that, you know, but for the most part, I was under the impression that it was mostly big in Japan and not too much in other places.

379
00:24:13,602 --> 00:24:16,460
Scott: So for that to be getting the sleep and wake up treatment.

380
00:24:16,861 --> 00:24:25,600
Rym: Well, so once I learned something about the reason for this is the hundredth anniversary of Shogakukan's founding.

381
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:26,600
Scott: Right.

382
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:31,500
Scott: But I mean, you know, the anniversary, if you look at the past anniversary things.

383
00:24:32,042 --> 00:24:32,250
Scott: Right.

384
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:36,580
Scott: It's like they've always been like anniversary celebration type productions in the past.

385
00:24:37,103 --> 00:24:37,546
Scott: But it's like.

386
00:24:37,566 --> 00:24:39,420
Scott: I think it's more true.

387
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:39,854
Rym: It's not.

388
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:45,040
Rym: Hey, here we have already committed to at least four whole seasons of this show.

389
00:24:45,181 --> 00:24:46,440
Rym: Like it's not this situation.

390
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:53,480
Scott: So, you know, you think about some of the anniversary things of the past might have been like, you know, like a one shot deals.

391
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:54,080
Scott: Right.

392
00:24:54,361 --> 00:24:59,560
Scott: Or small OAV type things, not entire TV series remake something.

393
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:03,420
Scott: You know, it's like, you know, it's like a bigger thing that actually stands alone.

394
00:25:03,542 --> 00:25:04,719
Scott: It isn't just some special.

395
00:25:05,248 --> 00:25:05,498
Scott: Right.

396
00:25:06,801 --> 00:25:12,060
Scott: It's not like Ursa Yatsura one episode, you know, special comeback for our anniversary.

397
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,699
Scott: It's like, nope, we're redo the whole deal.

398
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,339
Scott: Let's go to full TV season.

399
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:28,540
Rym: Thing is, what I'm excited about is the original show, the manga, everything about this show, this property, I guess I should say, is fantastic and extremely, deeply funny to me.

400
00:25:29,062 --> 00:25:33,839
Rym: And I hope that this rekindles global interest in this show.

401
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:36,780
Scott: It could happen.

402
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:38,218
Rym: Well, we'll see.

403
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:46,278
Rym: Maybe it'll be bad, but I'm definitely going to watch at least the whole first season of it, unless somehow it's a supreme stinker, uh, it'll get talked about.

404
00:25:47,303 --> 00:25:49,200
Scott: I mean, we'll, we'll watch enough to do a show on it.

405
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:49,695
Scott: That's for sure.

406
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:55,940
Rym: So in some other news, TCAF, uh, the, uh, uh, Toronto comics and arts festival.

407
00:25:56,502 --> 00:25:58,219
Rym: Yeah, it's a, I think so.

408
00:25:58,381 --> 00:26:00,680
Rym: It's a convention that I've been to, uh, what, what?

409
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:01,860
Rym: Comic arts festivals.

410
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:02,197
Scott: Right.

411
00:26:02,806 --> 00:26:03,239
Scott: I was correct.

412
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:08,000
Rym: Emily used to go to whatever year Emily had like tables and reasons to be there, uh, professionally.

413
00:26:08,221 --> 00:26:13,960
Scott: I went once, uh, it's a really fun, you know, it's, I was always, I never went to it, but I was under the impression.

414
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,300
Scott: It was a lot like, you know, the mocha arts festival used to go to right.

415
00:26:17,801 --> 00:26:19,220
Scott: And in the comics show, right.

416
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:22,860
Scott: Indie creators set up little tables, sell their, their little comics, you know.

417
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:23,295
Rym: Yup.

418
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:23,980
Rym: It's a fun time.

419
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:28,780
Rym: Toronto is a fun city to be in like in pre COVID times, like a lot going on, a lot of good going on with TCAF.

420
00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:32,860
Rym: Uh, I'm not going to cover the entire story of what happened here.

421
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:46,739
Rym: Cause there's a lot, but what happened was TCAF invited officially, uh, an individual known as pink cat, which is obviously like the name of the studio, Sue, a pseudonym, a property.

422
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:56,498
Rym: Uh, the artist behind it was a person who was very, very deep into the NFT scam, like big NFT scammer.

423
00:26:57,242 --> 00:26:58,889
Rym: And they made this art.

424
00:26:59,552 --> 00:27:01,460
Rym: that was just NFT bullshit.

425
00:27:02,242 --> 00:27:08,136
Rym: And for some reason, TCAF invited them and featured them and promoted them and made them a big part of TCAF.

426
00:27:08,613 --> 00:27:08,760
Scott: Right.

427
00:27:09,001 --> 00:27:17,559
Scott: It turned, I mean, the it's, there's basically one person on the TCAF board was a fan of the pink cat and champion them.

428
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:21,358
Rym: That one person appears to also be heavily invested in NFTs.

429
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,180
Scott: Well, is that, is that true?

430
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,079
Scott: Do you have evidence of that?

431
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,499
Rym: The yes, there's a name that was listed.

432
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:35,460
Rym: I'm avoiding any defamation here right now, but there are numerous sources pointing at a specific individual on the board and showing proof that they own a large number of NFTs.

433
00:27:36,261 --> 00:27:36,503
Scott: All right.

434
00:27:38,902 --> 00:27:40,279
Rym: Add a bunch of NFT conferences.

435
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:41,440
Scott: Okay.

436
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:44,960
Scott: Well, I mean, I don't know if any of that is true or not, cause I haven't seen any of that.

437
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:53,420
Scott: But the point I was going to say is that like, you know, either that person was an unwitting fan of, you know, this pink cat.

438
00:27:53,647 --> 00:27:53,838
Rym: Yeah.

439
00:27:54,107 --> 00:27:54,300
Scott: Right.

440
00:27:54,581 --> 00:27:57,560
Scott: Or they were, you know, a knowing fan.

441
00:27:58,166 --> 00:27:58,399
Scott: Right.

442
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:02,840
Scott: And you know, it's like if you're on the board, you know, boards of these things are not large.

443
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:09,259
Scott: If you're on the board of something, you know, championing like a single artist to being like, you know what?

444
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:12,480
Scott: This one artist should be one of the artists we feature at our show.

445
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,780
Scott: It's like, you got some sway.

446
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,139
Scott: You can probably make that happen.

447
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,120
Scott: And most of the time it's probably just fine.

448
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:26,377
Rym: But the thing is that artist, if anyone even looked at their Twitter or looked at their art or anything, it was clear that all they do is NFTs.

449
00:28:28,181 --> 00:28:30,379
Scott: I mean, clearly the other people didn't look closely.

450
00:28:31,004 --> 00:28:31,116
Rym: Yup.

451
00:28:31,663 --> 00:28:32,859
Scott: So until they did.

452
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,500
Rym: A bunch of guests of TCAF immediately were like, what's this NFT crap?

453
00:28:37,662 --> 00:28:38,292
Rym: Do you support NFTs?

454
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,960
Rym: Like we're going to, we're not going to come to TCAF.

455
00:28:41,402 --> 00:28:43,359
Rym: If you're doing NFT stuff, what's going on?

456
00:28:43,781 --> 00:28:47,100
Rym: And TCAF didn't really respond, but then it got way worse.

457
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,380
Rym: There is way more bad stuff about this artist.

458
00:28:50,742 --> 00:28:52,440
Rym: There is clear direct evidence.

459
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:55,819
Rym: They trace tons of their art from other people without crediting them.

460
00:28:56,744 --> 00:28:57,680
Scott: That's what NFTs are.

461
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,880
Scott: You just take JPEGs from the internet and try to sell them.

462
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,000
Rym: Their pink cat character appears to just be traces of other people's art.

463
00:29:04,621 --> 00:29:14,539
Rym: They also made a bunch of black coded art and made a bunch of commentary about it, but they are not black.

464
00:29:15,882 --> 00:29:21,017
Rym: When asked about this, they doubled down on some fairly racist things and it went off the deep end.

465
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:29,240
Rym: So basically then a bunch of bigger guests, including Ngozi, like a bunch of big TCAF guests were like, yeah, fuck this.

466
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,819
Rym: We're boycotting TCAF unless you guys do something about this.

467
00:29:32,765 --> 00:29:33,799
Rym: It's not just NFTs.

468
00:29:34,303 --> 00:29:36,758
Rym: Way, way beyond NFTs.

469
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,717
Rym: TCAF now rescinded.

470
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,380
Rym: The news is they have rescinded this invitation.

471
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:50,160
Rym: They have attempted to apologize for this, but their statement does not actually explain why they invited this person.

472
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:52,898
Rym: And more importantly, doesn't say anything about NFTs.

473
00:29:53,400 --> 00:30:00,840
Rym: So now the entire, like a huge percentage of the community of TCAF is saying, whoa, whoa, whoa, are NFTs allowed or not?

474
00:30:01,081 --> 00:30:05,800
Rym: You got to say you got to say something specific about NFTs or we're still not coming.

475
00:30:06,648 --> 00:30:06,880
Scott: Yeah.

476
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:18,260
Scott: It's like, you know, I guess this shows you that, you know, if you run a convention, you know, there's a lot of conventions out there, especially smaller ones that will get like any guest they can, especially if it's inexpensive.

477
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:18,585
Scott: Right.

478
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:25,779
Rym: And a lot of this is how you get a bunch of derpy cons that invited Vic Mignona because they didn't realize his scandal and had to uninvite him.

479
00:30:25,862 --> 00:30:26,077
Rym: Right.

480
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:29,440
Scott: Because the people running the con are not super connected to the scene.

481
00:30:29,521 --> 00:30:30,779
Scott: They don't know what's going on.

482
00:30:31,082 --> 00:30:32,880
Scott: Or they are connected to the scene and they're just bad.

483
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:40,720
Scott: But they're also cons or it's just like, you know, you'll have like, you know, there are agents out there that, you know, for low tier celebrities.

484
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,011
Scott: Right.

485
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:44,980
Scott: I remember it was a big thing, like a, you know, a decade or two ago.

486
00:30:45,461 --> 00:30:49,859
Scott: There was like, I remember in the nineties when I would watch pro wrestling, there was this guy, Virgil.

487
00:30:50,167 --> 00:30:50,420
Scott: Right.

488
00:30:50,741 --> 00:30:58,540
Scott: And he was a pro wrestler and you would see him on pro, you know, turn on Saturday morning after X-Men pro wrestling starts and he'd be on there.

489
00:30:58,962 --> 00:31:03,280
Scott: But he wasn't, you know, he was like one of the lower, not as famous pro wrestlers.

490
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,560
Scott: He wasn't Hulk Hogan.

491
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,560
Scott: You know, it's like he was some other dude.

492
00:31:06,666 --> 00:31:06,838
Scott: Right.

493
00:31:07,641 --> 00:31:15,220
Scott: And then I remember specifically that I saw him at like one of those, you know, sitting at a table doing autographs.

494
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:22,320
Scott: So like one of those sad, small comic book, you know, trading card, you know, shows at some point in like the two thousands.

495
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:38,799
Scott: And then I remember seeing jokes of like, you know, specifically targeting him, Virgil, the, the, the, the WWE pro wrestler of, you know, basically of, of, you know, very small amount of fame.

496
00:31:39,304 --> 00:31:39,466
Scott: Like.

497
00:31:39,729 --> 00:31:40,680
Scott: that's what he was doing.

498
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:43,160
Scott: He was appearing at lots and lots of those shows.

499
00:31:43,282 --> 00:31:44,219
Scott: Like that was his thing.

500
00:31:44,722 --> 00:31:47,740
Scott: And there are lots of people who do exactly that.

501
00:31:47,884 --> 00:31:48,013
Scott: Right.

502
00:31:48,562 --> 00:31:51,080
Scott: It's like, you know, and they just know those shows.

503
00:31:51,622 --> 00:31:56,000
Scott: And if you're running a, but if you're running a show, it's like, I need guests.

504
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:59,439
Scott: It's like, people like that are just going to come to you.

505
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,527
Scott: And it's like, you just be like.

506
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:02,360
Scott: this person's somewhat famous.

507
00:32:02,548 --> 00:32:02,714
Scott: Yeah.

508
00:32:03,645 --> 00:32:05,040
Scott: You were actually a pro wrestler.

509
00:32:05,222 --> 00:32:07,160
Scott: You were actually an actor in that TV show.

510
00:32:07,261 --> 00:32:08,656
Scott: You were actually this thing.

511
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,239
Scott: You have some fame.

512
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:13,759
Scott: You will draw a crowd of some number, right?

513
00:32:14,081 --> 00:32:15,940
Scott: I can use you to promote my con.

514
00:32:16,322 --> 00:32:20,500
Scott: It'll get someone in the door and you are very inexpensive to bring.

515
00:32:20,681 --> 00:32:24,860
Scott: Or in fact, free to bring because you'll just charge money for autographs or something.

516
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:33,200
Scott: And then you didn't actually look into these people and know about them or how your community or audience cares about, you know, whatever these people are.

517
00:32:33,542 --> 00:32:34,820
Scott: And you can get yourself into trouble.

518
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:38,280
Scott: You got to really vet every guest very thorough.

519
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:45,219
Rym: Well, we saw this with the anime cons where there was a brief period where a bunch of cons invited Vic Mcnona because they didn't know about all the bullshit with him.

520
00:32:45,582 --> 00:32:45,740
Rym: Yeah.

521
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:50,300
Scott: But now voice actor, he was like, actually he was the English voice actor.

522
00:32:50,441 --> 00:32:53,600
Scott: In a very popular anime at multiple popular animes.

523
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,929
Scott: But then he has fans.

524
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,339
Scott: Look at all the followers he has.

525
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,180
Scott: Why wouldn't I want him at my con?

526
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:14,920
Rym: But then all the backlash became so obvious that now the only cons that invite him are the cons that basically exclusively invite guests who are banned from other conventions and attract really dire after a certain point.

527
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:20,343
Scott: It's like, you know, people are loud enough or the audience informs you and you're going to want to point out.

528
00:33:20,363 --> 00:33:29,720
Rym: one of the last cons I saw him announced as a guest at was one of the cons that last year went maskless, no vaccine, no rules.

529
00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:30,760
Scott: All right.

530
00:33:31,082 --> 00:33:32,359
Scott: So anyone can run a con.

531
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,779
Scott: Bad people or good people.

532
00:33:35,481 --> 00:33:38,919
Rym: So TCAF has not yet made a statement on NFTs.

533
00:33:39,781 --> 00:33:48,536
Rym: And this is increasingly worrying because there's a lot of fear that TCAF has some commercial interest or at least someone on the board has continuing commercial interest in that scam.

534
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:52,020
Scott: It could be if it is really just one person.

535
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,540
Scott: The reason they might not be saying anything is lawyer reasons.

536
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:02,560
Rym: Yeah, you know, but they could issue a statement denouncing NFTs, which is honestly all all they'd have to do to make this completely go away.

537
00:34:03,482 --> 00:34:05,460
Rym: Yeah, they wouldn't have to do that.

538
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,999
Scott: They will do it very carefully.

539
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,420
Rym: All they'd have to do is say we don't support NFTs.

540
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,498
Rym: They're not welcome at the con.

541
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,639
Rym: They're banned at our tables.

542
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:12,724
Rym: That would be a even.

543
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:21,362
Scott: that even while that is very easy to say, you know, if you're an organization, you're going to be very careful, especially when you got some kind of issue like.

544
00:34:21,382 --> 00:34:24,340
Scott: they are even making such a bland statement.

545
00:34:24,701 --> 00:34:31,659
Scott: They're always so legally careful and cowardly, sometimes with good reason, sometimes just for cowardly reasons.

546
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,940
Rym: Yeah, let's see in some other news.

547
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:35,880
Rym: Oh, Seven Seas.

548
00:34:36,101 --> 00:34:37,880
Rym: There's a lot going on with Seven Seas.

549
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:45,360
Scott: So if you don't know, there's this company that's been around in the United States for quite a long time called Seven Seas Entertainment.

550
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,520
Scott: And Seven Seas is a manga publisher.

551
00:34:48,462 --> 00:34:49,099
Scott: They publish.

552
00:34:49,702 --> 00:34:49,855
Scott: They do.

553
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,940
Scott: They get manga from Japan.

554
00:34:52,803 --> 00:34:55,079
Scott: They translate it, edit it, et cetera.

555
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:55,440
Scott: Right.

556
00:34:55,699 --> 00:35:03,239
Scott: You know, flip it or not flip it, depending and publish it in print and digital forms in the United States.

557
00:35:03,564 --> 00:35:04,840
Scott: It's all legally licensed.

558
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:12,400
Scott: They're a real publisher, but the titles that they get are usually not the most popular titles, not the biggest titles.

559
00:35:12,589 --> 00:35:12,800
Scott: Right.

560
00:35:13,121 --> 00:35:21,700
Scott: They're usually niche titles or, you know, things that only super nerds know about, you know, things that aren't selling big, but the licenses are cheap.

561
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:22,317
Scott: Right.

562
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,400
Scott: So they're still profitable.

563
00:35:24,661 --> 00:35:29,140
Scott: And as you know, the rising manga tide lifts all boats, Seven Seas does okay.

564
00:35:29,161 --> 00:35:29,454
Scott: Right.

565
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:29,862
Scott: It's like.

566
00:35:29,882 --> 00:35:32,400
Scott: they're not, you know, going out of business, at least as far as I know.

567
00:35:32,861 --> 00:35:37,240
Scott: In fact, you know, they went from being really small, like 10 or so people.

568
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,780
Scott: I believe that I've seen reports that they now have like 40 employees.

569
00:35:40,921 --> 00:35:42,194
Scott: So it's like that's.

570
00:35:42,295 --> 00:35:42,800
Scott: that's okay.

571
00:35:42,922 --> 00:35:44,140
Scott: Business 40 employees.

572
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:44,270
Scott: Right.

573
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:44,957
Scott: That's not bad.

574
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:55,919
Scott: But apparently part of the reason their business maybe works so well is that the employees are underpaid, mistreated, overworked, et cetera.

575
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:59,220
Rym: No surprises, pretty much all of capitalism.

576
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,960
Rym: The companies where this is not true in any industry are the exception, not the rule.

577
00:36:03,342 --> 00:36:06,460
Rym: But comics and manga in particular are egregious.

578
00:36:06,962 --> 00:36:07,420
Scott: Right.

579
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:17,799
Scott: So but as it turns out, all those employees being cool manga fan type people were like, fuck this, we're going to union just like all the Starbucks is.

580
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:18,380
Scott: All right.

581
00:36:18,661 --> 00:36:19,740
Scott: And this is spreading.

582
00:36:19,943 --> 00:36:21,060
Scott: And it's good that it's spreading.

583
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,500
Rym: They have fantastic because they're comic artists.

584
00:36:23,902 --> 00:36:27,640
Rym: They made mascots for the union and they are delightful.

585
00:36:28,489 --> 00:36:28,699
Scott: Yeah.

586
00:36:29,481 --> 00:36:33,440
Scott: So, yeah, they they didn't vote to unionize yet.

587
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:40,800
Scott: They you know, you do usually do is you just so they don't they wouldn't necessarily you ask the company to just recognize your union voluntarily.

588
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:43,179
Scott: And then the company, of course, doesn't.

589
00:36:44,324 --> 00:36:45,640
Scott: So they're going to vote.

590
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:58,600
Rym: But I've seen reports that like 30 plus of the 40 employees are basically in favor, which really put seven seas in a harsh light, because if you say no to the union vote and the union vote is overwhelming.

591
00:36:58,810 --> 00:36:58,937
Rym: Yes.

592
00:36:59,141 --> 00:37:01,920
Rym: Anyway, you've already poisoned your relations with that union.

593
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,640
Rym: You could have just said yes and had a much favorable relationship much earlier.

594
00:37:07,393 --> 00:37:07,478
Scott: Yeah.

595
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:12,618
Scott: But anyway, so they're, you know, the national labor relations boards get, you know, does their usual thing.

596
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:19,920
Scott: The vote is going to happen at some point in the future that it'll I predict a yes based on the information I have available.

597
00:37:20,581 --> 00:37:28,220
Scott: And that will be very interesting because I wonder, right, you know, a lot of the other unions we've seen happening, right.

598
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:32,280
Scott: Amazons and Starbucks, those are against mega corporations, right?

599
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:38,640
Scott: You know, we've seen a few attempts and other things at some smaller places like, you know, some game studios here and there.

600
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:44,840
Scott: This one could be a really good example to figure out if right.

601
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,647
Scott: Will it what will?

602
00:37:47,747 --> 00:37:52,619
Scott: what kind of deal can the union get against such a small company that doesn't have a lot to give?

603
00:37:52,845 --> 00:37:52,955
Rym: Yeah.

604
00:37:53,101 --> 00:37:55,660
Rym: And that's that's where I have a worrying opinion.

605
00:37:55,981 --> 00:38:03,400
Scott: But and then B, if they get a deal right, will they end up like hurting?

606
00:38:04,221 --> 00:38:07,320
Scott: You know, obviously I'm in favor of the union and the people shouldn't be mistreated.

607
00:38:08,201 --> 00:38:10,040
Scott: We're super lefty labor people here.

608
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:16,960
Scott: But is this business of seven C's manga publishing right?

609
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:22,820
Scott: A viable business that can support right laborers who are fairly compensated.

610
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:30,038
Rym: So I would back up a little bit because I'm not it is not the it'll just go under, which is probably under the sea.

611
00:38:30,464 --> 00:38:31,679
Rym: It say that happened.

612
00:38:32,922 --> 00:38:35,720
Rym: That is, I think, the best outcome.

613
00:38:36,527 --> 00:38:36,919
Scott: I agree.

614
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:43,918
Rym: And if I back up because I don't want to imply that I know anything about seven C's financial care, I know nothing about it.

615
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:44,776
Rym: Yeah.

616
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:55,120
Rym: But what I'll say is generally I suspect that most for profit companies in America, in every industry, would immediately disappear if they had to treat their workers fairly.

617
00:38:55,402 --> 00:38:56,580
Rym: They would immediately collapse.

618
00:38:57,483 --> 00:38:59,560
Scott: I mean, that's true for like, you know, not just America.

619
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:00,460
Scott: It's true like worldwide.

620
00:39:00,626 --> 00:39:00,780
Scott: Right.

621
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:08,800
Scott: What if, you know, the iPhone factory had to treat all the workers like what we consider to be, you know, well, right.

622
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:12,112
Scott: It's like an iPhone would cost like a hundred thousand dollars.

623
00:39:12,132 --> 00:39:15,180
Rym: or maybe that is the purpose of government.

624
00:39:15,463 --> 00:39:16,940
Rym: And anyway, that's why I'm a communist.

625
00:39:17,083 --> 00:39:17,760
Rym: I'm not even kidding.

626
00:39:18,549 --> 00:39:18,758
Scott: Yeah.

627
00:39:20,145 --> 00:39:21,340
Rym: So we'll see how this goes.

628
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:25,400
Rym: This is a very important moment for comics as an industry.

629
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,260
Rym: Just straight up.

630
00:39:27,481 --> 00:39:34,400
Scott: It's going to be very fascinating to see, you know, if the vote succeeds, probably, then what direction does that?

631
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,960
Scott: What deal do they get and what direction does the company go?

632
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,359
Scott: Do they get a crappy deal?

633
00:39:38,822 --> 00:39:39,680
Scott: Do they get a deal?

634
00:39:39,801 --> 00:39:42,579
Scott: But then the company has to lay people off to carry on.

635
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:54,158
Scott: Does the, you know, how's, you know, is the company actually just evil and is hoarding some money at the top and they'll actually end up being forced to, you know, share the wealth and that will be a good thing.

636
00:39:55,461 --> 00:40:02,015
Scott: So many possible results, but it will be very fascinating to look back on this a year or two from now.

637
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:10,640
Rym: So if you're not familiar with something, Nino Cooney, you either know about it and care about it, or you have no idea what I'm talking about.

638
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:18,939
Scott: So Nino Cooney, right, if I remember correctly, was originally billed as like a Ghibli related kind of RPG.

639
00:40:19,343 --> 00:40:19,449
Scott: It is.

640
00:40:19,781 --> 00:40:20,500
Rym: It's long running.

641
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:26,760
Rym: This is from, like, more than a decade ago, but it's a Bandai Namco game with Joe Hisaishi.

642
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,340
Scott: Like, Joe Hisaishi does the music for it.

643
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,800
Scott: Yeah, it's Ghibli Ghibli.

644
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,059
Rym: Like, it's Ghibli all over.

645
00:40:32,821 --> 00:40:33,400
Rym: So whatever.

646
00:40:33,741 --> 00:40:42,120
Scott: I don't know if they have, like, Nino Cooney stuff at the Ghibli Museum, but, like, you know, let's see, the animated sequences are produced by Ghibli.

647
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:42,621
Scott: It's like.

648
00:40:42,883 --> 00:40:45,780
Scott: Ghibli is very involved in this RPG video game.

649
00:40:46,182 --> 00:40:52,680
Scott: When it was first announced, it, you know, it was so long ago, it felt like that's a thing that's never going to be translated to English.

650
00:40:52,821 --> 00:40:54,140
Scott: I'm never going to be able to play that.

651
00:40:54,320 --> 00:41:00,300
Rym: We have a Japanese copy of the, like, with the book and everything for the DS in Japanese.

652
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:06,280
Scott: But yeah, but I'm saying if you go back 10 years ago, I think there was a GeekNights episode that was first announced.

653
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,278
Scott: It was probably the news.

654
00:41:07,541 --> 00:41:10,998
Scott: And I probably said something like, wow, I want to play this, but it'll never be out in English.

655
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:15,820
Scott: Turns out it was successful and time went on and the world changed.

656
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,620
Scott: And yeah, it's available, obviously.

657
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,640
Scott: And there were many sequels and it's a long running series now, not just a one thing.

658
00:41:22,061 --> 00:41:25,360
Rym: And it's completely destroyed and dead now.

659
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:30,754
Scott: What's happening is, well, also in all that time, I did never, ever get to play any Nino Coonies.

660
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,419
Scott: So not even once.

661
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:39,801
Rym: The most recent iteration, because the before, so the last Nino Cooney that came out was in like 2012.

662
00:41:39,801 --> 00:41:42,099
Rym: And then the next one just came out like it.

663
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:52,860
Rym: It was released, I think, in June in Japan, and it was released worldwide, like in May, like just like last week, Nino Cooney Cross Worlds.

664
00:41:53,222 --> 00:41:57,279
Rym: And I'm not going to say anything else about Nino Cooney Cross Worlds because it is an NFT scam.

665
00:41:57,522 --> 00:41:59,421
Rym: It is 100%.

666
00:41:59,421 --> 00:42:12,938
Rym: The game is farm bullshit in a Ghibli world to get special coins that you can trade for other coins that you can migrate out of the game into a cryptocurrency wallet that you can then trade for like Bitcoin and shit.

667
00:42:13,901 --> 00:42:20,220
Rym: Well, the whole game is a cryptocurrency scam and the roadmap, actually, it doesn't have NFTs yet.

668
00:42:20,361 --> 00:42:23,200
Rym: It only has bullshit, fake, crisp cryptocurrency.

669
00:42:23,801 --> 00:42:29,700
Rym: The entire game is grind cryptocurrency and they're adding NFTs in December of this year.

670
00:42:32,023 --> 00:42:33,500
Rym: Ghibli is all on board with this.

671
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:37,159
Rym: This latest one is just as official as all the other ones.

672
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,759
Rym: Joe Hishai, she even did the music for this one.

673
00:42:40,384 --> 00:42:42,419
Rym: And it's a shame that it's just a bullshit scam.

674
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:52,277
Rym: So under no circumstances are you to play Nino Cooney, the Open Worlds Cross Worlds MMO that they just released.

675
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,279
Scott: Free to play, developed by Netmarble.

676
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:59,079
Scott: Wikipedia says, yeah, OK.

677
00:43:00,181 --> 00:43:02,599
Rym: How did you not see this was all over the news?

678
00:43:03,445 --> 00:43:05,279
Scott: That it's just a paying attention to this.

679
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:09,352
Rym: You can mine Terai to get Terai tokens that you trade in.

680
00:43:09,372 --> 00:43:13,040
Scott: the crossworlds generated 100 million in revenue in its first two.

681
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:14,579
Rym: Oh, it is crazy.

682
00:43:15,443 --> 00:43:17,380
Rym: It's actually doing really well in Japan and Korea.

683
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,619
Scott: Free game.

684
00:43:19,182 --> 00:43:24,097
Scott: And actually, it says here on Wikipedia that Japan accounted for only 45 percent of the revenue.

685
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:30,260
Scott: South Korea and Taiwan accounted for thirty five and fifteen point seven percent of the revenue respectively.

686
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:33,857
Scott: So it's taken over East Asia money.

687
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:38,640
Rym: But I cannot stress enough, this game is just a cryptocurrency scam.

688
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:40,318
Rym: There's like no game in there.

689
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:50,820
Scott: It's some kind of grindy MMORPG thing, which is a shame because I was under at least 10 plus years ago when the first one came out and I had only seen the trailer.

690
00:43:51,763 --> 00:43:53,779
Scott: And that's all I ever knew about it because I never played it.

691
00:43:54,902 --> 00:44:00,696
Scott: I was under the impression that it was going to be a single player JRPG.

692
00:44:00,716 --> 00:44:05,360
Scott: that was really fancy because of the Ghibli production values.

693
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,599
Rym: You can't make money with that.

694
00:44:07,263 --> 00:44:08,500
Rym: It's the year 2022.

695
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,759
Rym: You're going to cram some crypto NFT bullshit in there.

696
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:12,940
Rym: Also, probably some gotcha bullshit.

697
00:44:13,302 --> 00:44:16,497
Rym: And you're going to predate on kids until you run out of steam like that's.

698
00:44:16,919 --> 00:44:18,059
Rym: that's how you make money with games.

699
00:44:19,043 --> 00:44:20,859
Rym: Well, that's a shame.

700
00:44:21,941 --> 00:44:27,100
Rym: Uh, in some news, I never thought I would ever, ever say these words.

701
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:30,819
Rym: I never thought I'd even mention flying ghost ship on the show again.

702
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,959
Scott: We did a whole episode on flying good.

703
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:35,200
Scott: We reviewed flying phantom ship.

704
00:44:35,774 --> 00:44:35,919
Rym: Yep.

705
00:44:36,822 --> 00:44:41,120
Rym: When we saw it, it was translated as phantom or flying ghost ship.

706
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:45,400
Rym: But it looks like that the official translation is flying phantom ship.

707
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:50,600
Rym: Regardless, this movie, which if you haven't seen it, go listen to our review.

708
00:44:50,861 --> 00:44:55,440
Scott: It's a Japanese Russian co-production anime from a long time ago.

709
00:44:56,021 --> 00:45:01,640
Rym: And it involves like, I don't think it was actually, it was a co, it wasn't a co-production, but there was some co-financing.

710
00:45:01,801 --> 00:45:05,100
Rym: It's not as much of a Russian thing as anyway.

711
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:11,959
Scott: It has notoriety because, uh, you know, Miyazaki animated like a part of it, like the robot part or whatever.

712
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:16,319
Rym: I think it has notoriety because it is absolutely fucking bonkers.

713
00:45:16,901 --> 00:45:20,440
Rym: And if it is, if you want so many different things crammed together.

714
00:45:20,541 --> 00:45:23,729
Rym: If you watch the first 10 minutes of it, you'll think, oh, it's just gonna be do all right.

715
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:24,878
Rym: I'm down board with this.

716
00:45:25,321 --> 00:45:34,919
Rym: If you pick any random two minutes of this movie from any part, other than the first 10 minutes, it will be very difficult for you to figure out how the fuck it got there.

717
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:35,880
Scott: Yeah.

718
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,809
Scott: It's like, it's, oh, it's like, you'll have.

719
00:45:38,352 --> 00:45:39,840
Scott: parts of it are like Astro boy.

720
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:47,379
Scott: Parts of it are like the Slurm episode of it are like the famous horror movie, the stuff.

721
00:45:48,447 --> 00:45:48,658
Scott: Yep.

722
00:45:49,601 --> 00:45:52,816
Scott: Uh, parts of it are like, you know, 10,000 leagues under the sea.

723
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:54,128
Rym: Yup.

724
00:45:54,661 --> 00:46:02,399
Rym: If you saw project blue cheek, you it, they're very, there are a lot of similarities between these two parts of it or pirates of the Caribbean, obviously with the flying ghost ship.

725
00:46:03,642 --> 00:46:07,420
Scott: It's basically so many different things going on, crammed into one movie.

726
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:09,555
Rym: Crafty and horror comes in at one point.

727
00:46:10,803 --> 00:46:12,520
Scott: It is absolutely wild.

728
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:13,580
Rym: It's worth watching.

729
00:46:14,241 --> 00:46:17,220
Scott: I can go listen to our episode on it or watch the movie itself.

730
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:20,160
Scott: But the news is that disco tech, right?

731
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:28,460
Scott: Which is, uh, you know, much like in fact, seven seas, uh, there are small anime publisher in the United States as opposed to a small manga publisher.

732
00:46:29,381 --> 00:46:40,879
Scott: Uh, but disco tech is actually kind of, you know, cooler, a lot cooler than seven C has the shit together a lot more, uh, doesn't just get sad licenses, but gets licenses occasionally to really cool stuff.

733
00:46:41,541 --> 00:46:46,740
Scott: Um, and they put out, you know, lots of blue rays that hardcore anime nerds won, right?

734
00:46:46,801 --> 00:46:48,180
Scott: Old school anime nerds, right?

735
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:51,040
Scott: So you want to, you know what fist of the North star box set.

736
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:53,100
Scott: That's what disco tech is going to bring you, right?

737
00:46:53,301 --> 00:47:10,279
Scott: So, um, they got all kinds of loupons going on too right now, but anyway, they're going to put out a flying Phantom ship and got a new dub for it on probably the highest quality version of this movie that will ever be available to the public.

738
00:47:10,902 --> 00:47:12,780
Rym: I think I watched a file.

739
00:47:14,203 --> 00:47:15,779
Scott: It's kind of cool that they're doing that.

740
00:47:16,325 --> 00:47:17,820
Rym: I want to see if, cause I was on YouTube.

741
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:18,960
Rym: I think I've been linked to it at one point.

742
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:20,420
Rym: The whole movie used to be on YouTube.

743
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:21,958
Rym: I bet that got taken down now.

744
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:24,499
Scott: Who knows, but it'll be on Blu-ray now.

745
00:47:25,515 --> 00:47:25,679
Rym: So nope.

746
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:26,960
Rym: Whole thing's just on YouTube.

747
00:47:27,806 --> 00:47:28,059
Scott: Okay.

748
00:47:29,624 --> 00:47:30,880
Rym: In VHS looking quality.

749
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,440
Rym: So this is, this is important.

750
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:33,410
Scott: Yeah.

751
00:47:34,242 --> 00:47:38,080
Rym: I look forward to watching this one more time in my life and high quality, honestly.

752
00:47:38,682 --> 00:47:39,780
Scott: I'll do that when I'm super old.

753
00:47:40,282 --> 00:47:42,140
Rym: It's a, it's a ride that movie.

754
00:47:42,882 --> 00:47:44,280
Scott: That's a retirement home movie.

755
00:47:45,042 --> 00:47:46,459
Rym: So, uh, it's early in news.

756
00:47:46,741 --> 00:47:47,439
Rym: It's just something fun.

757
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:54,240
Rym: Anime Boston is the last anime con that Scott and I regularly attended and performed at for a lot of reasons.

758
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,538
Scott: We've talked about the last pure anime con.

759
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:59,539
Scott: There were other cons we went to that had anime at them.

760
00:47:59,900 --> 00:47:59,996
Rym: Yeah.

761
00:48:00,321 --> 00:48:03,800
Rym: But anime Boston was the perfect storm of, it wasn't Otakon.

762
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:09,560
Rym: It was a big anime con close to New York, get there via train in and out.

763
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:13,159
Scott: Uh, the staff people there that we knew and could have fun with.

764
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:13,365
Rym: Yep.

765
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:18,839
Rym: Like we'd be there doing a ton of panels, all our other Anna Twitter friends, and also be there doing panels.

766
00:48:19,421 --> 00:48:22,460
Scott: It was usually a really good concert to go to that was worth attending.

767
00:48:22,742 --> 00:48:23,280
Rym: Oh my God.

768
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:24,860
Rym: I've, I think it's all the best.

769
00:48:25,401 --> 00:48:31,740
Rym: Other than when Otakon got L'arc en Ciel in the giant arena, all the best anime con concerts I ever saw were at anime Boston.

770
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:34,280
Scott: They're, you know, pretty good concerts.

771
00:48:34,402 --> 00:48:34,490
Rym: Yeah.

772
00:48:35,064 --> 00:48:36,320
Rym: Good anime con all around.

773
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:41,819
Rym: We stopped going for reasons that have nothing to do with the dedication of the staff or the quality of the con itself.

774
00:48:41,947 --> 00:48:42,100
Rym: Yeah.

775
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:46,520
Scott: It was mostly just, you know, the hassle of getting there, the hassle of dealing with security, right?

776
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:52,000
Scott: The fact that, you know, spending a whole weekend there when we only were, you know, doing stuff for some of that.

777
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:55,100
Rym: Granted, we were doing like six panels at any one of these.

778
00:48:55,162 --> 00:48:55,460
Rym: Sure.

779
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:59,640
Scott: But even doing six panels, we had a lot of time just doing nothing there.

780
00:48:59,700 --> 00:48:59,835
Scott: Yeah.

781
00:49:00,042 --> 00:49:00,596
Scott: It's like, okay.

782
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:05,820
Rym: What really hurt was that anime panels, we can't put them on YouTube like all our other panels because of copyright.

783
00:49:07,248 --> 00:49:08,139
Scott: So anyway.

784
00:49:09,703 --> 00:49:14,474
Scott: So still a person who wants to go to anime cons, anime Boston is an anime con you should go to.

785
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:15,858
Scott: You absolutely should near it.

786
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:22,339
Rym: But anime Boston has a long running tradition of having a swap meet that I am happy to say went to once or twice.

787
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:22,616
Scott: Yeah.

788
00:49:22,721 --> 00:49:25,359
Rym: Not only is it continued, but it appears to have grown.

789
00:49:27,088 --> 00:49:27,318
Scott: Yeah.

790
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:31,274
Scott: So there was a report, I guess, on the swap meet and like.

791
00:49:31,515 --> 00:49:32,940
Scott: it is way bigger now.

792
00:49:34,041 --> 00:49:37,900
Rym: And I wish I'd been able to go because I got a lot of anime crap.

793
00:49:38,241 --> 00:49:45,199
Scott: That's the thing is even when I was going to anime Boston, I wanted to bring crap to the swap meet, but it's like, how am I going to get it there?

794
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:48,300
Scott: Since I'm not a car person, I was taking a train or bus there.

795
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:52,099
Rym: I mean, we're on an Amtrak and I'm bringing like equipment with me.

796
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:53,478
Scott: Yeah.

797
00:49:53,881 --> 00:49:57,840
Scott: It's like, you can't bring a box full of mangas and figurines and other garbage.

798
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:59,100
Scott: That's a pain in the ass, right?

799
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:09,339
Rym: So there's an article in Anime News Network by Ruben Baron that just, it talks about like, just direct primary journalism of how the swap meet went down.

800
00:50:10,483 --> 00:50:12,740
Rym: It's got the quote from Christian Daley.

801
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:16,800
Rym: I'm always happy to see Christian Daley still being mentioned in the anime world.

802
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:21,059
Scott: Christian Daley, if anyone doesn't know, right, is a person that we barely know.

803
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:22,038
Scott: Barely know.

804
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:25,980
Rym: He was like the distant predecessor of what we did with RIT anime.

805
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:29,299
Scott: When we were at the RIT anime club, he was a freshman.

806
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:37,620
Scott: He was a person who was mentioned as a previous anime club president, but he had graduated by the time we got there.

807
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:40,660
Rym: He was legendary enough to where his name was still spoken.

808
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:44,920
Rym: Kind of like how, at least as of four years ago, our names are still spoken at RIT anime.

809
00:50:45,481 --> 00:50:47,399
Rym: I feel like that finally might have died now.

810
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:49,620
Scott: He's at least five years older than us, right?

811
00:50:50,962 --> 00:51:05,239
Scott: But there were at least two occasions at Anime Boston where we bumped into him and I guess we knew who each other were at least, even though we didn't really have any kind of relationship other than, "I know you exist, I know who you

812
00:51:05,419 --> 00:51:05,480
Scott: are.".

813
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:15,520
Scott: But it's like, I remember his name and I know that he has been involved heavily in Anime Boston, like basically forever, effectively.

814
00:51:15,581 --> 00:51:16,240
Rym: He's done a bunch of jobs.

815
00:51:16,461 --> 00:51:17,159
Rym: He's done a bunch of jobs.

816
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:21,020
Rym: He's currently the director of exhibits and the dealer's room manager.

817
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:24,519
Scott: Oh, I think that's what he was also when we met him.

818
00:51:24,942 --> 00:51:26,760
Rym: I know he's done other jobs at some point along the way.

819
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:30,380
Scott: He's been running that Anime Boston dealer's room for a long time.

820
00:51:30,641 --> 00:51:35,178
Rym: But unlike me and Scott, honestly, GeekNights, we pivoted pretty hard into gaming instead of anime.

821
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:39,679
Rym: Christian Daley is one of the people who pivoted hard into anime and stayed there.

822
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:42,339
Scott: He just stuck with that "run the dealer's room" job.

823
00:51:42,765 --> 00:51:43,159
Scott: Good for him.

824
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:49,200
Scott: So anyway, Christian Daley is responsible for the swap meet, is the point.

825
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:49,593
Rym: Yep.

826
00:51:50,243 --> 00:51:51,140
Rym: And it's just fascinating.

827
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,120
Rym: The comments about this article are even fun.

828
00:51:53,341 --> 00:51:54,519
Rym: The swap meet is a fun thing.

829
00:51:55,400 --> 00:52:02,319
Rym: I feel like it would almost be worth it for me to, if I have some other reason to be in during Anime Boston, to go for one day.

830
00:52:03,341 --> 00:52:08,500
Rym: I am confident there are nerds who will take for, like, I would even trade away for nothing.

831
00:52:09,061 --> 00:52:11,239
Rym: Almost all the anime crap I've accumulated over the years.

832
00:52:11,821 --> 00:52:13,360
Scott: I got a lot of crap I can trade away.

833
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:16,600
Rym: Anyone want all entire mangas?

834
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:21,400
Scott: Do you think we can organize like a New York City nerd swap meet?

835
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:23,340
Scott: Like bring nerdy stuff.

836
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:26,700
Scott: If it's games, anime, manga, comics, right?

837
00:52:26,921 --> 00:52:27,379
Scott: Technology.

838
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:34,939
Rym: Yeah, listen, do you want to roll into Anime Boston with the biggest goddamn collection to trade and you're welcome to keep anything you trade for?

839
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,258
Rym: We'll hook you up.

840
00:52:36,702 --> 00:52:37,017
Scott: We could do it.

841
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:41,040
Scott: It could be a flea market and or swap meet kind of deal, right?

842
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:44,940
Scott: And we basically have, you know, we could sell, we don't just sell tables.

843
00:52:45,142 --> 00:52:46,700
Scott: We sell tables by time.

844
00:52:47,181 --> 00:52:53,400
Scott: That way it's like, you know, you can sign up for like an hour and see how much of your shit you can get rid of in an hour or two hours or whatever.

845
00:52:53,708 --> 00:52:53,940
Scott: Right.

846
00:52:54,041 --> 00:53:01,820
Scott: And then, you know, people who really have a lot of stuff, they can buy it, you know, in a more, a bigger table in a, in a more flea market kind of arrangement.

847
00:53:02,588 --> 00:53:02,779
Scott: Right.

848
00:53:03,121 --> 00:53:06,778
Scott: And it could even be like an outside thing, like in that, you know, parking lot or some shit.

849
00:53:06,887 --> 00:53:07,060
Scott: Right.

850
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:09,139
Rym: The other way to go is just for one day.

851
00:53:09,362 --> 00:53:09,447
Rym: Yeah.

852
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:16,836
Rym: You organize something like that, but make sure it's organized near a convention that will attract nerds that already exists to get out of towners into,

853
00:53:17,137 --> 00:53:24,411
Scott: or we just promote it, you know, in New York City, like in all the nerd communities in New York City, all the nerd, you know, stores, we hang up a sign and, you know,

854
00:53:24,491 --> 00:53:30,429
Rym: one night only, I was about to say one night only the fabulous

855
00:53:30,851 --> 00:53:33,739
Scott: one, one, one morning to afternoon only rhythm

856
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,568
Rym: and blues review, 10

857
00:53:35,568 --> 00:53:37,679
Scott: to six, something like that, you know, 10 to seven.

858
00:53:38,562 --> 00:53:40,140
Rym: We'd have to make a poster that looked like that.

859
00:53:40,401 --> 00:53:42,700
Rym: Anyway, it's not out of the realm.

860
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:58,900
Rym: I, uh, once we get to a point where either it's safe enough or like, I feel like next year I'm going to try, if no one else does it, I'm going to try to, I'm going to rekindle the board game meetup that started in Long Island City right before COVID and died because of COVID.

861
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:05,978
Rym: And I actually found the people who founded it and I'm going to, I'm going to actively rekindle it if and when it is safe enough to do so.

862
00:54:06,887 --> 00:54:07,238
Scott: All right.

863
00:54:07,784 --> 00:54:08,219
Scott: Well, we'll see.

864
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:12,360
Rym: The problem is the venue they hosted it in also went under because of COVID.

865
00:54:13,522 --> 00:54:17,980
Scott: A really good place to do it would be at the new Pig Beach, which has many tables.

866
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:22,236
Rym: The previous one was in the giant beer garden that opened in Long Island City.

867
00:54:22,276 --> 00:54:25,140
Rym: that was never crowded on weekends and had a million tables.

868
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:27,320
Scott: Pig Beach can't, it's not going to be crowded on weekdays.

869
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:31,020
Scott: But the problem is that it's a barbecue place.

870
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:32,720
Scott: You can't eat barbecue that often.

871
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:33,619
Scott: You're going to be in trouble.

872
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,480
Rym: Also barbecue of all the foods.

873
00:54:38,261 --> 00:54:42,620
Rym: I don't want some nerd eating while they're playing a board game with me, especially.

874
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,420
Scott: I'm not a person who cares about preserving the board game.

875
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:45,774
Scott: Oh yeah.

876
00:54:46,281 --> 00:54:55,278
Rym: But I don't want barbecue is not the, there is, there are no number of napkins there to make your hands safe to touch any board game I own.

877
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:56,126
Scott: Yeah.

878
00:54:57,711 --> 00:54:57,920
Scott: Anyway.

879
00:54:58,520 --> 00:54:58,797
Rym: All right.

880
00:54:59,221 --> 00:55:00,679
Rym: Uh, got a couple more little newses.

881
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:02,379
Rym: So, um, Scott's not watching it.

882
00:55:02,641 --> 00:55:04,698
Rym: You should at some point just pirate it if you have to.

883
00:55:05,422 --> 00:55:16,580
Rym: Uh, the Owl House, which is ending like Disney's basically canceled it after its third season, though it will tell its whole story because they're going to condense everything into like this abbreviated third seasons.

884
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:17,818
Rym: They can at least get it all out.

885
00:55:18,401 --> 00:55:22,697
Rym: But the Owl House is one of the better shows Disney has put out.

886
00:55:22,757 --> 00:55:23,480
Rym: that is animated.

887
00:55:23,941 --> 00:55:25,989
Rym: It seems like a big part of why it's being canceled is one.

888
00:55:26,049 --> 00:55:31,540
Rym: it's super gay, which means Disney has trouble marketing it in countries like China.

889
00:55:32,061 --> 00:55:42,600
Rym: But two, it's really dark and weird in a way that some executive said out loud doesn't jive with the Disney brand.

890
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,699
Rym: So it, it got killed for a bunch of reasons.

891
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:47,840
Scott: But I mean, if something is understand, right?

892
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:50,300
Scott: It's like, okay, it doesn't jive with your brand, right?

893
00:55:50,421 --> 00:56:01,980
Scott: But it's like, if it makes money, if it's popular enough and it's profitable and it's a good, you like it, you know, the something like the alternative is something that would make less money or it's like, be riskier, right?

894
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,540
Scott: It's like, just don't write Disney's Owl House.

895
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:06,100
Scott: Just call it fucking Owl House.

896
00:56:06,701 --> 00:56:13,080
Rym: And yeah, I mean, there's a reason a lot of comics publishers have an imprint for the stuff that causes trouble for exactly.

897
00:56:13,209 --> 00:56:13,380
Scott: Right.

898
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,600
Scott: It's like DC Comics had, you know, fucking Vertigo.

899
00:56:15,782 --> 00:56:16,840
Scott: They're like, oh, it's Vertigo.

900
00:56:16,921 --> 00:56:19,600
Scott: That way, you know, kids go to the store to buy some DC Comics.

901
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:28,220
Scott: They don't buy, you know, they don't look at, you know, if it's a DC on it, a kid might buy it thinking it's a superhero thing, you know, but I go on it.

902
00:56:28,702 --> 00:56:32,720
Rym: I think it's one of my favorite cartoons to come out in the last five or six years.

903
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:37,620
Rym: And I highly encourage you watch it because season two is finishing the second half of season two.

904
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:38,646
Rym: There's 40 episodes.

905
00:56:39,733 --> 00:56:40,598
Rym: just it's out.

906
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:41,880
Rym: You can watch a bunch of it.

907
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:45,400
Rym: I'm almost caught up and it continues to be good.

908
00:56:46,282 --> 00:56:47,379
Scott: Not super news.

909
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:49,699
Scott: It's actually old news by now because it's already June.

910
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:55,520
Scott: But Saga, the comic, the best comic published in English.

911
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:57,339
Rym: Oh, I stopped reading Saga.

912
00:56:58,006 --> 00:56:59,320
Scott: Well, Saga stopped publishing.

913
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:01,307
Scott: It took a long break after.

914
00:57:01,327 --> 00:57:04,720
Scott: I forget where I left off after a certain volume.

915
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:10,539
Scott: A very big thing happened at the very end and they stopped publishing it for quite a while as a hiatus.

916
00:57:11,082 --> 00:57:12,000
Scott: That hiatus is over.

917
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:12,440
Rym: Oh, shit.

918
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,740
Rym: I just remembered what happened right before the hiatus.

919
00:57:15,881 --> 00:57:26,620
Scott: Yeah, the hiatus is over and Saga has been coming out again and it shouldn't be long until, you know, there's enough single issues to make another trade paperback.

920
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:28,280
Rym: Somehow I lost.

921
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:31,120
Scott: I had every volume of Saga trade paperbacks.

922
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:34,539
Scott: Somehow I lost them all.

923
00:57:34,801 --> 00:57:35,479
Scott: I don't know.

924
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:38,200
Scott: It's like I must have lent them to someone who didn't get them back.

925
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:39,400
Scott: I don't know what the hell happened.

926
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:41,039
Scott: Did I lose them when I moved?

927
00:57:41,361 --> 00:57:42,640
Scott: Like, they are not anywhere.

928
00:57:43,281 --> 00:57:47,280
Scott: I'm just going to have to rebuy it maybe in the big fancy editions or something.

929
00:57:47,523 --> 00:57:47,858
Scott: I don't know.

930
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:55,079
Rym: I mean, the first if you'd let's do a review of Saga if you haven't read it or don't know what we're talking about.

931
00:57:55,561 --> 00:58:00,979
Rym: But also I'll just point out the first trade by itself won the Hugo for best graphic story.

932
00:58:02,161 --> 00:58:05,920
Rym: Yeah, it was.

933
00:58:06,081 --> 00:58:08,419
Scott: So they actually they have a box set of pretty well.

934
00:58:09,701 --> 00:58:11,996
Rym: So far it's gotten 12 Eisner's and 17 Harvey's.

935
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:22,760
Scott: Yeah, so, yeah, there's a box set you can get that has everything pre hiatus and you can also get some fancy hard covers if you really want.

936
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:27,140
Scott: And then, yeah, there have been one, two, three, four, five, six issues, right?

937
00:58:27,382 --> 00:58:30,780
Scott: It started up again in January 2022.

938
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:36,219
Scott: And I'm sure that there will be a trade paperback coming soon.

939
00:58:37,989 --> 00:58:39,220
Rym: So I guess one last little news.

940
00:58:40,121 --> 00:58:43,979
Rym: This actually just came out like a few days ago.

941
00:58:44,542 --> 00:58:46,660
Rym: But Bob's Burgers has a movie.

942
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:51,440
Rym: There's actually just a movie and I'm definitely going to.

943
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:53,460
Scott: I mean, I knew that Bob's Burger was a thing.

944
00:58:53,562 --> 00:58:54,099
Scott: I've heard of it.

945
00:58:54,264 --> 00:58:54,799
Scott: I've seen it.

946
00:58:54,941 --> 00:58:56,299
Scott: I could recognize what it looks like.

947
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:57,552
Scott: Watched it.

948
00:58:57,980 --> 00:59:04,100
Scott: But I do know that there are a lot of people who actually, you know, like are fans of it and I've been keeping it going.

949
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:06,919
Scott: And it's you know, it has some popularity, but that's all I know.

950
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:09,399
Rym: Because what's funny is when it came out.

951
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:13,220
Rym: Well, you know, like it started in 2010, 2011.

952
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:17,878
Scott: I get I'm guessing based on the title, it's about someone who owns a burger shop and their name is Bob.

953
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:18,211
Rym: Yep.

954
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:20,136
Rym: But the main that's all.

955
00:59:20,156 --> 00:59:20,519
Scott: that's it.

956
00:59:20,841 --> 00:59:23,513
Rym: What most people know about it, which what I knew about it was.

957
00:59:23,875 --> 00:59:26,000
Rym: the main guy, Bob, is voiced by John Benjamin.

958
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:28,900
Rym: One of the best voice actors there is who plays a very particular character.

959
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,618
Rym: Also, Sterling Archer, the guy who plays Archer.

960
00:59:32,662 --> 00:59:34,940
Rym: No, I don't think he voice acts in any shows you watch.

961
00:59:36,342 --> 00:59:37,439
Rym: He's a fantastic voice actor.

962
00:59:38,822 --> 00:59:41,800
Rym: He plays the master in Venture Brothers.

963
00:59:42,482 --> 00:59:44,620
Rym: You hear his voice, you'll know exactly who this guy is.

964
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:47,660
Rym: He's just really, really funny and good at voice acting.

965
00:59:48,321 --> 00:59:54,519
Rym: But I always just kind of ignored the show because 2010 to like 2020, like that last decade.

966
00:59:54,823 --> 00:59:55,610
Scott: Oh, he's the Dr.

967
00:59:55,651 --> 00:59:56,559
Scott: Cat's voice guy.

968
00:59:58,027 --> 00:59:58,294
Scott: Oh, OK.

969
00:59:58,721 --> 00:59:59,539
Scott: Now I know who that is.

970
00:59:59,961 --> 01:00:00,777
Scott: That's how old I am.

971
01:00:03,823 --> 01:00:07,540
Rym: So this show I kind of slept on like I do.

972
01:00:07,741 --> 01:00:08,919
Rym: It was I'd seen some clips from it.

973
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:09,659
Rym: It was OK, funny.

974
01:00:10,223 --> 01:00:12,160
Rym: There was a crossover episode with Archer.

975
01:00:12,381 --> 01:00:16,458
Rym: That was actually pretty funny where Archer had a crossover with it, not the other way around.

976
01:00:16,981 --> 01:00:21,340
Rym: But recently, unrelated to the movie coming out, Emily and I started watching a bunch of Bob's Burgers.

977
01:00:22,002 --> 01:00:27,479
Rym: And I will say this, and I know this might sound like I'm overhyping it.

978
01:00:28,221 --> 01:00:33,200
Rym: It is way, way funnier and better than I possibly expected.

979
01:00:33,881 --> 01:00:48,760
Rym: I would say the average quality of an episode of Bob's Burgers is about the level of a season four or a season seven Simpsons episode, not the the purest peak of The Simpsons, not seasons five and six, but four and seven.

980
01:00:49,462 --> 01:00:51,760
Rym: This is this is that level of humor.

981
01:00:51,901 --> 01:00:54,980
Rym: This is absolutely as good as season four of The Simpsons.

982
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:58,800
Rym: This show is if you ever slept on Bob's Burgers, fucking watch some of it.

983
01:00:58,900 --> 01:00:59,439
Rym: Good Lord.

984
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:00,720
Rym: It doesn't even matter when.

985
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:01,293
Rym: Just pick up.

986
01:01:01,625 --> 01:01:01,875
Rym: I don't know.

987
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:04,420
Rym: Pick like random episode of season three and just start going.

988
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:04,960
Scott: Where is it?

989
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:05,262
Scott: Is it?

990
01:01:05,688 --> 01:01:06,659
Scott: what TV network is it?

991
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:08,159
Scott: Like what streaming service has it?

992
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:11,999
Rym: How do you think I know how to watch a show other than how are you watching it?

993
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,340
Rym: Pirate Bay and a free Hulu account.

994
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:16,739
Scott: OK, so it's on Hulu.

995
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:18,719
Rym: Yeah, I think it's on Hulu.

996
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:21,178
Rym: OK, it's probably on some other places, too.

997
01:01:22,184 --> 01:01:23,219
Rym: There's ways to watch it.

998
01:01:24,181 --> 01:01:33,080
Rym: I suspect there is a Bob's Burgers, all seasons dot something file you can download somewhere if you know where those kinds of things are.

999
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:39,560
Rym: But the show is great and I actually really pumped to see the movie.

1000
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:42,240
Rym: The movie just looks I don't.

1001
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:52,859
Rym: I think the movie, the impression I get from the trailer and from some initial reviews I saw, it's not going to be like The Simpsons movie, which was a little bit of a. we're already past the shark, like the shark is dead.

1002
01:01:53,241 --> 01:01:54,599
Rym: We jumped over it and then it died.

1003
01:01:54,944 --> 01:01:56,119
Rym: And then they made a Simpsons movie.

1004
01:01:56,622 --> 01:01:58,580
Rym: This feels like it's not that kind of situation.

1005
01:02:02,323 --> 01:02:11,320
Rym: And I feel like that's enough news because I want to make sure I have time to eat dinner before every hockey game I watch to do Wednesday episodes lately because we're not watching a lot.

1006
01:02:11,901 --> 01:02:16,660
Scott: And it's like we already decreased our anime watching so much since the years ago.

1007
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:27,694
Rym: The Rangers game tonight is going to be the most important Rangers game of the season and every Rangers game is going to be the most important hockey game we've seen in a week or two days.

1008
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:32,575
Rym: Every hockey game I watch is going to be one of the most important hockey games of this season.

1009
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:36,136
Scott: It's been like seven years since you've seen Rangers games.

1010
01:02:36,177 --> 01:02:36,820
Scott: this significant.

1011
01:02:39,683 --> 01:02:41,840
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1012
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:46,938

01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:55,300

01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:10,980

1020
01:03:38,943 --> 01:03:42,220
Rym: I'm just gonna go watch some hockey and I simply leave you with...

1021
01:04:09,142 --> 01:04:13,100
Scott: And the best game you can name is the good ol' hockey game.

1022
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:16,359
Scott: Second period.

1023
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:21,600
Scott: Where players dash with skates of flash, the home team trails behind.

1024
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:26,280
Scott: But they grab the puck and go bursting up and they're down across the line.

1025
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:30,920
Scott: They storm the crease like bumblebees, they travel like a burning flame.

1026
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:35,640
Scott: We see them slide the puck inside, it's a 1-1 hockey game.

1027
01:04:36,262 --> 01:04:40,459
Scott: Oh, the good ol' hockey game is the best game you can name.

1028
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:45,400
Scott: And the best game you can name is the good ol' hockey game.
