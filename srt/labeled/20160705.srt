00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,732
Rym: It's Tuesday July 5th 2016.

00:00:11,732 --> 00:00:12,894
Rym: I'm Rym.

00:00:23,981 --> 00:00:27,548
Rym: Let's do this Kind of feeling roller coasters.

5
00:00:27,608 --> 00:00:29,655
Rym: I've been thinking about roller coasters a lot like that.

6
00:00:29,695 --> 00:00:32,426
Rym: clock hasn't rung in a long time And it's really ringing.

7
00:00:32,506 --> 00:00:33,250
Scott: What okay?

8
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:39,959
Rym: What I just really want to ride a roller coaster All right, so I'm thinking about going to ride a roller coaster all right, okay?

9
00:00:40,944 --> 00:00:43,337
Rym: You've been very unexcited about pretty much everything lately.

10
00:00:43,357 --> 00:00:43,840
Rym: Are you dying?

11
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,024
Scott: What's there to be excited about?

12
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:46,847
Rym: I don't know.

13
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:47,710
Rym: it's summer.

14
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:48,653
Rym: We can buy it.

15
00:00:49,034 --> 00:00:49,656
Rym: stuff's nice.

16
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,905
Rym: I'm doing that all right You're not excited about it.

17
00:00:52,528 --> 00:00:53,211
Scott: What is there to say?

18
00:00:53,231 --> 00:00:55,160
Rym: is there anything you're excited about in the entire world?

19
00:00:58,446 --> 00:00:59,939
Scott: All right, the weather's still good.

20
00:01:00,421 --> 00:01:01,625
Scott: It's gonna sell it for a while.

21
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:08,813
Rym: Tycho tweeted the other day, and he was like basically it appears that he encountered fascination for the first time.

22
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:12,186
Rym: hmm and fascination is the thing that's not widely known.

23
00:01:12,226 --> 00:01:26,260
Rym: it was very popular in like the 50s like the late 50s early 60s and By the 70s it was basically gone from all the places that it existed Except cedar point which had one of the first rigs, and it was like a big deal there.

24
00:01:26,761 --> 00:01:35,878
Rym: It was there at cedar point from 1955 until like the 2000s when they finally got rid of it because no one cares about What is actually kind of a shitty game?

25
00:01:36,523 --> 00:01:38,679
Scott: We could just make a fascination if you really wanted one.

26
00:01:39,013 --> 00:01:39,521
Rym: Yeah But you could.

27
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:44,199
Scott: as long as someone maintains the memory of how the game is played anyone can make one if they ever wanted to.

28
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:49,857
Scott: Yep actually That would be a good thing for someone to make a digital version of on phones that everyone like.

29
00:01:49,898 --> 00:01:55,300
Rym: it's like oh Yeah, when everyone just fascinates and in fact you want to make it a little engaging like you have to flick the balls up.

30
00:01:55,401 --> 00:01:58,584
Rym: So it's all like that kind of obviously Game to begin with.

31
00:01:58,885 --> 00:01:59,848
Rym: yeah, even though it isn't.

32
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:01,414
Rym: it's just a random game that you can.

33
00:02:01,434 --> 00:02:07,260
Scott: obviously we'd put lots of randomness into the Engine after you play your dexterity bit basically multiplayer Angry Birds.

34
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:15,503
Rym: But so this game you know he tweeted about it, and I just remembered that it existed and It can't.

35
00:02:15,523 --> 00:02:20,627
Rym: this is like the second time it had disappeared from my life, and then out of nowhere I bump into it somewhere.

36
00:02:20,668 --> 00:02:21,874
Scott: I didn't wild where they had it.

37
00:02:21,954 --> 00:02:22,256
Rym: Yeah.

38
00:02:22,356 --> 00:02:23,100
Rym: I was some years ago.

39
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,170
Rym: We go to wildwood one year, and I'm like what fascination.

40
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,256
Rym: There's no way and we walk in as totally it.

41
00:02:28,858 --> 00:02:33,920
Rym: so I Can't vouch for the chain of custody.

42
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:45,422
Rym: But I found a blog that claims That the fat at least some of the fascination set that is in Wildwood was the one they took from cedar point Mmm.

43
00:02:45,743 --> 00:02:46,786
Rym: I can't verify that.

44
00:02:46,806 --> 00:02:50,517
Rym: I don't know how I could verify the head other than trying to call people.

45
00:02:50,577 --> 00:02:55,951
Rym: that could be some investigative journalism, but What I did find is a photo.

46
00:02:56,012 --> 00:03:14,985
Rym: because the building you know if that area of cedar point Was just a really cool area because it was built in the 50s that part The park was already old at that point and they built like this brand new modern pavilion And like this giant convention center and all these buildings and fascination was a part of it, so I found this photo from The 90s.

47
00:03:15,045 --> 00:03:17,560
Rym: it looks like and you can see the fascination building there.

48
00:03:17,941 --> 00:03:22,290
Rym: And I found this other photo from the 50s and you can see that.

49
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:27,306
Rym: It's literally Clothing.

50
00:03:27,367 --> 00:03:30,559
Rym: the people are wearing Mm-hmm, it's good stuff.

51
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:37,766
Rym: So I could kind of want to go to see the point like real bad that that I saw that photo when I was like Oh, man, and then I spent like 10 minutes.

52
00:03:37,786 --> 00:03:40,354
Rym: Just looking at pictures of like the Millennium Force.

53
00:03:40,756 --> 00:03:42,060
Scott: So just go I'm thinking about it.

54
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,346
Rym: I think stop you.

55
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:45,054
Rym: I gotta find a free weekend.

56
00:03:45,074 --> 00:03:46,018
Rym: We had a lot of shit going on.

57
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,615
Scott: You can just go like tomorrow me back in time for ConnectiCon.

58
00:03:49,635 --> 00:03:52,829
Rym: uh I could except I got shit to do.

59
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:56,122
Rym: so if I got shit to do for ConnectiCon don't do that shit Alright.

60
00:03:56,142 --> 00:03:59,298
Rym: anyway got any news because there's actually a lot of gaming news.

61
00:03:59,398 --> 00:04:01,668
Scott: suddenly It is one ginormous gaming news.

62
00:04:01,828 --> 00:04:04,700
Scott: So it's been sort of a half news for a while, right?

63
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,832
Scott: This is one of those news stories or when it first showed up.

64
00:04:06,952 --> 00:04:08,340
Scott: I was like, that's not news.

65
00:04:08,441 --> 00:04:10,039
Scott: I read about that like a month ago.

66
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,424
Scott: Yes that the.

67
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:19,500
Scott: the non news is that people are basically gambling on eSports using Things in steam to launder the money, right?

68
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:23,696
Scott: So I think we explained this and we talked about this when it was news to begin with.

69
00:04:23,757 --> 00:04:34,061
Scott: but just to reiterate So you're maybe underage or maybe you're in a you're betting on eSports You're almost definitely under the age of 18 or do not have a credit card or maybe right, you know You.

70
00:04:34,523 --> 00:04:38,860
Scott: for some you want to bet on something that you normally not allowed to bet on sports gambling and you want to bet on?

71
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,523
Scott: eSports like.

72
00:04:39,725 --> 00:04:45,860
Scott: I bet Rym is gonna win this counter-strike match or I bet Dago's gonna win this Street, so in other words, you're already a moron, right?

73
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,040
Scott: You're already more on betting on this.

74
00:04:47,103 --> 00:05:04,873
Scott: so You go and you can't use real money for this because you get the shut the fuck down in jail and bad stuffs and a That wants to facilitate that obviously can't do it with real money because even the fan duel and you know draft kings Which are enormous had, you know, bajillions of dollars were advertising all over TV.

75
00:05:05,113 --> 00:05:07,179
Scott: huge companies got shut down, right?

76
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:08,859
Scott: Because you can't get away with that.

77
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:19,335
Scott: So what people did is they said all right everyone turn your money into like counter-strike skins will gamble the skins And then you can turn it back into money and it'll be money laundering and it'll totally work.

78
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,081
Scott: and it worked and it still works Today.

79
00:05:21,162 --> 00:05:22,185
Scott: you can do this now.

80
00:05:22,225 --> 00:05:23,670
Rym: That is not the whole story.

81
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,456
Rym: That's just like what I think that's.

82
00:05:25,476 --> 00:05:26,520
Scott: that's the old news.

83
00:05:26,741 --> 00:05:27,022
Scott: That was.

84
00:05:27,082 --> 00:05:27,724
Scott: that's been so.

85
00:05:27,745 --> 00:05:31,540
Scott: we talked about that a long time ago when it started happening and it's not new.

86
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,444
Scott: Here's the new thing.

87
00:05:32,946 --> 00:05:36,180
Scott: So there was a site that was facilitating this sort of gambling.

88
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:43,080
Scott: Okay, this site was being promoted on certain counter-strike streamers YouTube channels.

89
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,384
Rym: Yep, shouting man, right?

90
00:05:44,424 --> 00:05:48,717
Scott: So obviously if you're a you know counter-strike streamer, that's the kind of sponsor you're gonna get.

91
00:05:48,777 --> 00:05:49,600
Scott: it makes total sense.

92
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:58,380
Scott: Okay Those YouTube streamers were revealed to have been the owners of that site.

93
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:01,077
Scott: So this is like it's low.

94
00:06:01,097 --> 00:06:01,560
Rym: What did you say?

95
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:10,074
Rym: It's like if I ran three-card Monty and I played against my own Three-card Monty in a YouTube stream and I was winning a ton of money.

96
00:06:10,094 --> 00:06:12,783
Rym: because look how fucking great I am at this Isn't it amazing?

97
00:06:12,963 --> 00:06:13,284
Rym: Right?

98
00:06:13,304 --> 00:06:16,333
Rym: It's basically you should also play this three-card Monty that I don't.

99
00:06:16,694 --> 00:06:26,079
Scott: they didn't reveal the fact that they own this Company, they just pretended like they were being sponsored by it and then they were on stream or on YouTube would you know?

100
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,541
Scott: gamble and Win.

101
00:06:28,561 --> 00:06:38,260
Scott: so it's like if it's like if I went into the Scott casino and you didn't know that I was Scott and I made A video of myself at the roulette table and he just kept landing on my number and I was raking it in.

102
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:44,400
Scott: I'm like, wow everyone this Scott casino was just sponsoring me, you know, they're paying me to advertise how great they are.

103
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:49,117
Scott: But look I came here and I'm totally raking it in like at the roulette table.

104
00:06:49,197 --> 00:06:49,960
Scott: Holy shit everyone.

105
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,265
Scott: You got to come down to the Scott casino.

106
00:06:51,326 --> 00:06:51,787
Scott: It's crazy.

107
00:06:52,390 --> 00:07:00,620
Scott: You didn't know that it literally not only was You know me owning the casino, but also that roulette table is rigged.

108
00:07:01,005 --> 00:07:07,780
Scott: And if you come to the Scott casino You're gonna lose all your money and the whole casino is built on top of a giant money laundering ring, right?

109
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,192
Scott: So these guys got caught and revealed.

110
00:07:11,212 --> 00:07:13,240
Rym: now what's a huge fiasco?

111
00:07:13,682 --> 00:07:14,466
Scott: This is one.

112
00:07:14,487 --> 00:07:24,000
Rym: it's almost like another step toward Big boy times with eSports because that's the kind of corruption that you get in real things where there's real money.

113
00:07:24,565 --> 00:07:27,198
Rym: But they're not real big time yet They're little baby money.

114
00:07:27,802 --> 00:07:33,139
Rym: And the reason you know, there's still a little baby money is that this is such a government hasn't?

115
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:34,724
Rym: first It's such babies.

116
00:07:34,804 --> 00:07:37,834
Rym: first scam like it took what was out of the call.

117
00:07:37,894 --> 00:07:38,897
Rym: someone posted a video like.

118
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:39,760
Rym: they figured this out.

119
00:07:40,442 --> 00:07:45,459
Rym: It took basically a few minutes of investigative journalism to figure out what was going on.

120
00:07:45,861 --> 00:07:49,532
Rym: Like this was not the best and brightest minds and organized crime.

121
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:52,100
Rym: Yeah, this is like a couple steps below Fat Tony.

122
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,587
Scott: Right, but the regulated casinos of the world.

123
00:07:54,688 --> 00:07:58,680
Scott: You should take bets on eSports because apparently people want to make those bets.

124
00:07:59,003 --> 00:08:04,994
Rym: Yeah, but the people who want to make those bets are Probably dumb young kids and they only have counter-strike skins to bet.

125
00:08:05,014 --> 00:08:06,018
Scott: they don't have money to bet.

126
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:13,590
Rym: Yep So if you'll take counter-strike skins if I can go to your casino give you a counter-strike skin and get chips and we're gonna talk.

127
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,599
Scott: Also noteworthy that like valve as you know Shut them down to an extent.

128
00:08:19,142 --> 00:08:24,700
Scott: But valve is not like done everything within their power that they could do if they wanted to to shut this down.

129
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:35,515
Rym: Well, the problem is there's no way to 100% shut this kind of thing down just because unless you remove the markets or skins I'm waiting for the shoe to drop and the government to come after.

130
00:08:35,576 --> 00:08:46,960
Scott: pretty much everyone Who has sort of a currency like steam has steam money that can be exchanged into real money Like even I'm surprised they'd have it in all these years gone after like Second Life money, which can be turned into real money

131
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,129
Rym: I think the only reason they have not enough money

132
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:51,840
Scott: or Eve online money, which can be turned into real money, right?

133
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,846
Scott: Eventually, the government is gonna cut.

134
00:08:53,927 --> 00:08:56,800
Scott: our governments of the world will go after these things.

135
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:07,740
Rym: Even if they can't be turned back into real money directly they can still be used for these purposes because they have a value Because there is a market even if that markets entirely within these egos.

136
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:13,018
Scott: yes, but would you bet a picture of Abraham Lincoln that could get you a bacon egg and cheese sandwich?

137
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:16,880
Scott: and Even if you won and the winnings were huge you can get a million dollars.

138
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,900
Scott: But those million dollars could only be used to buy pokeballs in Pokemon.

139
00:09:21,422 --> 00:09:24,555
Scott: Yeah, you would not make that bet because you'd rather have a union.

140
00:09:24,595 --> 00:09:25,920
Scott: five dollars of real money.

141
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,866
Scott: They could be used for anything.

142
00:09:26,926 --> 00:09:31,099
Scott: but the problem is more valuable than a bazillion dollars That can only be used for you worthless counter-strike skins.

143
00:09:31,381 --> 00:09:34,635
Rym: If you made it the other way like in overwatch their skins, right?

144
00:09:34,756 --> 00:09:38,300
Rym: Like there's all this stuff There's no way to trade them with other people.

145
00:09:38,642 --> 00:09:39,365
Rym: You can just get.

146
00:09:39,405 --> 00:09:42,220
Scott: they do that on purpose because they don't want this kind of shit to have.

147
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,567
Rym: Yeah, it's a one-way valve.

148
00:09:43,607 --> 00:09:44,834
Rym: they come into you and you can't.

149
00:09:44,854 --> 00:09:45,880
Rym: they can't ever go away from you.

150
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,900
Rym: You can't like sell your sweet sick skin to someone.

151
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:59,359
Scott: Yep, but like the directness of this scam is almost Insulting quote but cover makes money on this right because they make a cut every time you make a you know.

152
00:09:59,721 --> 00:10:01,072
Scott: Yeah, sell some shit on Steam.

153
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:02,000
Rym: So wasn't even worse.

154
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,545
Rym: They were from what I read.

155
00:10:03,585 --> 00:10:10,759
Rym: they were going so far as to make fake videos like straight-up Rigged matches as part of all this.

156
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:16,480
Scott: Like it goes it's not like you're gonna find the server and spectate it and see and watch the match.

157
00:10:16,821 --> 00:10:17,544
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

158
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:17,946
Rym: It's like.

159
00:10:18,146 --> 00:10:20,777
Rym: it's like if I made a betting ring, but it's not even the sting.

160
00:10:20,817 --> 00:10:24,837
Rym: remember that world WWF wrestling board game from the late 80s?

161
00:10:26,002 --> 00:10:29,395
Rym: No, well, it came with a VHS tape and maybe I do.

162
00:10:29,576 --> 00:10:42,800
Rym: occasionally in the game You'd both like get a wrestler like I get Hulk Hogan and you get Andre the Giant and then you'd watch Like a part of the VHS tape and you'd see the match and whichever whichever wrestler won you got points.

163
00:10:43,563 --> 00:10:46,699
Rym: It'd be like if I ran a betting ring on that VHS tape.

164
00:10:48,723 --> 00:10:53,761
Scott: Oh, if you haven't seen it the movie the sting it's maybe like I Can't.

165
00:10:53,801 --> 00:10:57,780
Scott: I can't make a ranking right now, but top 50 movies of all time ever buried me.

166
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,200
Scott: It's a real good man the history of human beings.

167
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,631
Scott: So you have to see that it's a necessary movie for all human beings to watch.

168
00:11:03,771 --> 00:11:03,871
Scott: but

169
00:11:03,912 --> 00:11:04,634
Rym: watch regardless

170
00:11:04,674 --> 00:11:05,697
Scott: of actual rank and

171
00:11:05,777 --> 00:11:14,159
Rym: realize that What they what the characters pull off in in that movie is so far beyond the little baby scam that happened here

172
00:11:15,202 --> 00:11:22,200
Scott: Yep, and even the sting which when you watch it seems like pro mode is not even real close to real pro mode.

173
00:11:22,622 --> 00:11:25,200
Rym: Yeah, so I guess eSports is starting to come of age.

174
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:30,980
Rym: But the problem is you're gonna get basically any time like an industry appears like this and gets to a certain level.

175
00:11:31,622 --> 00:11:41,279
Rym: There's a lot of obvious dumb scams that you could do to make a lot of money and no one no one bigger than you Or smarter than you is paying attention enough to stop you.

176
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:49,771
Rym: Like if you try to do like baby's first scam in like the drug trade or Any of the things that the real mafias in you'll be dead.

177
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:52,040
Rym: They'll either kill you or they'll take all your money.

178
00:11:52,606 --> 00:11:53,558
Scott: Yeah, it's like and people.

179
00:11:54,661 --> 00:11:58,440
Scott: It's like people who know how three-card money works and go to one and start winning.

180
00:11:58,681 --> 00:12:00,932
Scott: Yeah, you know what happens when you walk away from the three-card money.

181
00:12:00,952 --> 00:12:02,539
Scott: They come and beat you up and take the money back.

182
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,169
Scott: But here like you're not smart.

183
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:07,731
Rym: there are.

184
00:12:07,792 --> 00:12:09,258
Rym: no one big is watching this.

185
00:12:09,319 --> 00:12:13,318
Rym: yet So small fry took out smaller fry you got.

186
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:18,433
Rym: you know There's way more similar level corruption and nonsense going on in this realm.

187
00:12:18,734 --> 00:12:19,596
Rym: the moral of all of this?

188
00:12:19,897 --> 00:12:20,760
Rym: don't bet on eSports.

189
00:12:21,061 --> 00:12:22,687
Rym: It's the dumbest thing you could do don't?

190
00:12:22,827 --> 00:12:30,294
Scott: I mean first of all betting at all is dumb because even if you bet in a regulated Non-cheating place like a real legit casino the house always wins.

191
00:12:30,474 --> 00:12:36,511
Rym: and you know, even if you ever bought a stock I mean, you know It's just a sliding scale.

192
00:12:36,591 --> 00:12:37,778
Rym: I'm just saying just saying.

193
00:12:38,585 --> 00:12:39,231
Rym: But no, you're right.

194
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,746
Rym: Don't go to casinos Don't bet money in casinos.

195
00:12:41,987 --> 00:12:44,195
Rym: if you're gonna bet money at least bet money that you expect.

196
00:12:44,255 --> 00:12:49,020
Scott: if you're going to bet money Bet it in that legit casino and not in some unregulated crazy house.

197
00:12:49,181 --> 00:12:52,698
Scott: Yeah, cuz look they can just take your money and I'll give you anything back as they fuck you.

198
00:12:53,462 --> 00:12:54,386
Scott: We're not regulated.

199
00:12:54,447 --> 00:12:56,195
Scott: We're just you just gave me money for nothing.

200
00:12:56,316 --> 00:13:00,340
Rym: Uh-huh Yeah, at least in the casino they take your money, but then they give you like free food.

201
00:13:00,681 --> 00:13:06,529
Scott: If the casino doesn't give you money when you give them the chips back like the cops will come and make them do it Right or they get shut.

202
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:07,379
Scott: this things will happen.

203
00:13:07,841 --> 00:13:16,567
Scott: but if you buy some chips at the you know random you buy some counter jury skins to gamble with and They don't give you money in exchange for skins.

204
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:17,309
Scott: You're just fucked.

205
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,979
Scott: You're sitting there with a fancy-looking gun and you that's it.

206
00:13:20,761 --> 00:13:35,340
Rym: But it's interesting because they did this shadily to make their money and be semi-legal like they advertise the site like it was an open site but Bitcoin exists, they weren't even big enough fry to just do it like directly with bitcoins.

207
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:37,565
Rym: Think about that.

208
00:13:37,846 --> 00:13:41,100
Rym: They had to go a step below Bitcoin as their current.

209
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:44,340
Scott: Well, I think it's because their target audience couldn't get bitcoins.

210
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:47,754
Scott: their target audience though is kids who have time and don't even have credit cards.

211
00:13:47,774 --> 00:13:51,290
Scott: so they can just play counter-strike and Get skins and then bet with them.

212
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,264
Scott: and then literally you see if like you're a kid You have no money.

213
00:13:54,525 --> 00:13:58,140
Scott: So you play counter-strike and you win some skins by playing counter-strike.

214
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,333
Scott: You just earn it with time which you have plenty of and then you turn those.

215
00:14:01,393 --> 00:14:12,679
Scott: you can turn those skins into a bunch of Money to buy steam games if you gamble and win with them as opposed to Grinding even more and steam games are worth way more to kids that age the kids who have so much free time.

216
00:14:12,739 --> 00:14:15,043
Rym: Yeah It's just.

217
00:14:16,128 --> 00:14:20,767
Rym: I don't have a lot of sympathy for the people who are betting on this stuff Because how can you how do you not see this coming?

218
00:14:21,368 --> 00:14:22,412
Rym: But at the same time?

219
00:14:22,472 --> 00:14:28,430
Rym: Yeah, I kind of expecting all this to get shut down and Maybe some of these people go to jail like.

220
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,840
Rym: I don't think so because I don't think it's even big enough time.

221
00:14:31,761 --> 00:14:37,320
Scott: I don't think there's any DA or anything or federal agent or anyone who's even noticed this thing has happened.

222
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:38,464
Scott: Yeah, it's not.

223
00:14:38,565 --> 00:14:42,300
Scott: the Justice Department isn't even like this isn't even like a paper in their office.

224
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:50,631
Rym: But in a way it's kind of like the scammers who only target load small drug dealers because the small drug dealer can't call the police On you when they were drug deal.

225
00:14:50,671 --> 00:14:52,340
Rym: Yeah, it's kind of the same thing.

226
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:56,211
Rym: But they're targeting the same kinds of kids who buy games.

227
00:14:56,512 --> 00:15:00,303
Rym: they trade their games in at the electronics boutique Mm-hmm.

228
00:15:01,306 --> 00:15:05,600
Rym: So in other news, there's an article on Kotaku and it was big in the rounds.

229
00:15:05,721 --> 00:15:09,780
Rym: I kind of feel like I got to talk about it because it it is such a tag is still around.

230
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,659
Rym: Yeah, that's part of my news.

231
00:15:11,802 --> 00:15:19,094
Rym: Okay But well actually interestingly when I googled for the thing we just talked about The number one result is a bunch of Kotaku articles.

232
00:15:19,134 --> 00:15:19,939
Rym: Not any other side.

233
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:27,619
Rym: Whatever it's a true story, uh The other thing not this thing your thing your thing Kotaku is like the number one source when I googled.

234
00:15:28,202 --> 00:15:38,920
Rym: But anyway this thing it's just an op-ed on Kotaku about overwatch, but it was titled overwatch is competitive mode is at odds with the rest of the game.

235
00:15:39,641 --> 00:15:44,160
Rym: That's the kind of thing that someone like us might say in a panel and then try to back it up with some evidence.

236
00:15:44,825 --> 00:15:46,579
Rym: And I saw a lot of people commenting on this.

237
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:53,299
Rym: But this article is sort of amazing because it's basically Complaining up.

238
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:53,701
Rym: it's like it.

239
00:15:53,762 --> 00:16:00,509
Rym: it's like you complaining about a banana because it's yellow and it tastes good and You could throw the peel on the ground someone might slip on it.

240
00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:08,763
Rym: and that's funny like Complaining about the thing for being the thing it is and complaining about the thing for the thing for the thing that the thing is supposed to be The.

241
00:16:09,045 --> 00:16:26,124
Rym: so basically the article talks about how overwatch Players have a certain sort of Expectation of the game like you're gonna keep leveling up like you're always progressing That it's not a super serious competition that you can just sort of play for fun that the matchmaking is very individually driven So you can just randomly play with people.

242
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:35,869
Rym: it'll always be fun, and he's mad that because the competitive mode exists People who are serious about the game Look down on.

243
00:16:35,909 --> 00:16:38,500
Rym: the non-competitive mode is not being the real game.

244
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,143
Scott: What do you care?

245
00:16:39,183 --> 00:16:40,027
Scott: what someone else does?

246
00:16:40,148 --> 00:16:42,520
Scott: you don't like the competitive mode don't play it.

247
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,107
Scott: What does it matter whether it exists or not?

248
00:16:44,147 --> 00:16:46,780
Rym: mad that the people who are in competitive mode if he plays in it?

249
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:47,618
Rym: That's not even playing.

250
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,491
Scott: That's like if you're playing in the little league and you're mad.

251
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:52,020
Scott: the Major League Baseball exists.

252
00:16:52,341 --> 00:16:54,893
Scott: It's like you can just not watch it and not pay attention to it.

253
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:56,300
Scott: Just keep playing a little league game.

254
00:16:56,947 --> 00:16:57,736
Scott: What's the problem?

255
00:16:57,837 --> 00:16:58,040
Rym: yep?

256
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:06,593
Rym: But he's also like he gets in a pretty specific detail about like how you level up and level up in the normal game But then in the competitive game you might level down like.

257
00:17:06,633 --> 00:17:07,718
Rym: that feels real bad.

258
00:17:07,738 --> 00:17:08,179
Rym: don't suck.

259
00:17:08,601 --> 00:17:10,388
Rym: It feels bad to have an elo ranking.

260
00:17:10,409 --> 00:17:11,554
Scott: if you suck don't play it.

261
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,119
Scott: then yeah, what's the problem?

262
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,046
Scott: I mean this isn't new.

263
00:17:14,107 --> 00:17:15,880
Scott: this is like hundred-year-old news, right?

264
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:22,319
Scott: It's there are people who are gamers who actually want to compete and test their skills against each other and see who is better.

265
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:27,940
Scott: But then there's an ender game And you know you think this is a false dichotomy because it's like you're splitting things right down the middle.

266
00:17:28,102 --> 00:17:29,905
Scott: I was like no It's not a false dichotomy at all.

267
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:46,093
Scott: there are two types of gamers the kinds who want to compete and see who's better and the Just like playing a game and want to just enjoy the act of playing it and just want to feel good all the time and Don't care about testing their skills or seeing who's better than anyone else now.

268
00:17:46,113 --> 00:17:46,896
Scott: That's fine.

269
00:17:47,097 --> 00:17:48,160
Rym: both kinds of gaming.

270
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,680
Scott: You're totally legitimate right, but what's being mad that the other kind of person exists?

271
00:17:52,941 --> 00:17:58,759
Scott: It's like every one thing if overwatch is only competitive mode now, but it's not so who the fuck cares?

272
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:00,248
Rym: yeah But it's interesting.

273
00:18:00,268 --> 00:18:10,552
Rym: I've never seen we were talking about this the other day I've never seen an article that was so on the nose of someone basically saying I Really, just want to climb into that Skinner box and never come out right.

274
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:12,740
Rym: I really just give me that variable reward schedule.

275
00:18:12,901 --> 00:18:14,615
Scott: That's the one thing that really gets me right.

276
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:16,544
Scott: is like you look And it's like you know you.

277
00:18:16,564 --> 00:18:20,678
Scott: when you imagine a rat in a Skinner box or a person playing an RPG or you know a?

278
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,212
Scott: Candy crush you think ah there's a person they have.

279
00:18:24,293 --> 00:18:24,915
Scott: you know the psych.

280
00:18:25,016 --> 00:18:26,000
Scott: you see the psychology.

281
00:18:26,101 --> 00:18:30,568
Scott: They're like ah they are trapped in this loop of you know Reward and right.

282
00:18:30,688 --> 00:18:32,999
Scott: it's like aha I see what has happened to them.

283
00:18:33,682 --> 00:18:37,894
Scott: But for the person to be you imagine the rat doesn't realize what's going on.

284
00:18:37,934 --> 00:18:40,136
Scott: right the rat is just eating food and doing its thing.

285
00:18:41,061 --> 00:18:44,435
Scott: But for the person to know like I know I'm in a Skinner box.

286
00:18:44,495 --> 00:18:45,680
Scott: I know how a Skinner box works.

287
00:18:46,283 --> 00:18:47,629
Scott: I know everything that's going on here.

288
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:48,774
Scott: There is no mystery here.

289
00:18:49,075 --> 00:18:50,160
Scott: I see behind the curtain.

290
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:56,227
Rym: I like what I see behind the curtain, but I see out the window outside the Skinner box And I'm mad that that exists.

291
00:18:56,328 --> 00:18:58,840
Scott: right I am happy to be in the Skinner box.

292
00:18:58,961 --> 00:19:00,791
Scott: I don't want this Skinner box to change how it works.

293
00:19:00,851 --> 00:19:02,360
Scott: I like what's going on behind that curtain.

294
00:19:02,681 --> 00:19:07,840
Scott: I love being in here, but I'm mad that there's a world outside of the Skinner box that has been brought to my attention.

295
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,009
Rym: I mean here's a line from the article.

296
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:09,453
Rym: This is just.

297
00:19:09,493 --> 00:19:10,400
Rym: this is exquisite.

298
00:19:11,042 --> 00:19:17,597
Rym: So let's say you win a 40-minute match only to find that your skill rating level bar barely budgets.

299
00:19:17,998 --> 00:19:20,109
Rym: That's fucking unsatisfying.

300
00:19:20,129 --> 00:19:30,819
Rym: partially on Because overwatch previously trained us to a. Expect short matches and be expect big rewards after those short matches.

301
00:19:31,582 --> 00:19:32,185
Scott: Look, so don't.

302
00:19:32,225 --> 00:19:34,012
Scott: well first of all don't play competitive mode.

303
00:19:34,052 --> 00:19:34,293
Scott: second.

304
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:35,056
Rym: What rewards?

305
00:19:35,076 --> 00:19:36,180
Rym: there's no rewards.

306
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,063
Rym: It's just a game.

307
00:19:37,103 --> 00:19:37,966
Rym: you either win or lose.

308
00:19:37,986 --> 00:19:39,392
Rym: you don't level up anything.

309
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:40,215
Rym: a number goes up.

310
00:19:40,255 --> 00:19:41,580
Rym: that number means literally nothing.

311
00:19:42,002 --> 00:19:42,405
Scott: Oh, it does.

312
00:19:42,445 --> 00:19:46,812
Scott: if you're a person who likes numbers going up But like someone who plays candy crush the only

313
00:19:46,832 --> 00:19:54,616
Rym: thing the numbers ever meant to me is sometimes I see someone who has a really really high number But then they're not good And I just feel bad for them because I know they played way more than me there.

314
00:19:54,716 --> 00:19:56,463
Scott: listen most people Seem to like.

315
00:19:56,503 --> 00:19:58,609
Scott: you know, they even it's it does.

316
00:19:58,649 --> 00:20:09,940
Scott: the weird part is even though they recognize that this number is just a number They still like it And it's like, you know, I feel like once you recognize what's going on, then it doesn't work.

317
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,325
Scott: It shouldn't work on you anymore.

318
00:20:11,365 --> 00:20:12,911
Rym: when you saw through the matrix.

319
00:20:12,931 --> 00:20:15,300
Rym: He didn't immediately go and eat a steak, right?

320
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:21,000
Scott: It's like, you know You see the Wizard of Oz behind the curtain and even the fucking dumbass tin man who has no brain.

321
00:20:21,341 --> 00:20:21,743
Scott: Here's the woman.

322
00:20:21,783 --> 00:20:22,306
Scott: no brain, right?

323
00:20:22,506 --> 00:20:24,013
Scott: No, who does do his no brain?

324
00:20:24,174 --> 00:20:25,399
Scott: scarecrow the scarecrow.

325
00:20:27,962 --> 00:20:31,440
Scott: And he sees that the Wizard of Oz is not really this magic hologram thing.

326
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,699
Scott: It's just a dude behind the curtain and even him with no brain is like I was a bunch of horseshit.

327
00:20:36,241 --> 00:20:43,598
Scott: Hey, but meanwhile, this dude is a scarecrow going behind the curtain and say oh, I see it's a guy behind their curtain But don't take my fucking hologram away.

328
00:20:45,321 --> 00:20:46,407
Scott: I'm worshiping this hologram.

329
00:20:46,447 --> 00:20:47,654
Scott: stay the fuck away curtain man.

330
00:20:47,815 --> 00:20:49,141
Scott: Don't turn that shit off Now.

331
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:58,140
Rym: in general though the people who and like I said people are playing overwatch and seem to not super like competitive mode I've seen a common theme and this is kind of my point here.

332
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:09,139
Rym: the common theme among most of those people is that they're playing by themselves and They're salty that the matchmaking is not accommodating them that well and that they isn't it like the best matchmaking there is it is.

333
00:21:09,259 --> 00:21:11,588
Rym: but Overwatch was from the very beginning.

334
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:12,712
Rym: It is a team game.

335
00:21:12,853 --> 00:21:14,700
Rym: It is a team of six versus a team of six.

336
00:21:15,061 --> 00:21:23,031
Rym: It'd be like if I complained that the Detroit Lions are doing crappily even though one of their players is super good Like that player should be ranked up onto a different team.

337
00:21:23,232 --> 00:21:26,412
Scott: That's how all professional sports yeah,

338
00:21:26,432 --> 00:21:30,513
Rym: so The only the only complaints I'm seeing of normal

339
00:21:30,653 --> 00:21:32,200
Scott: basketball where one person can carry the team

340
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:44,789
Rym: There's this article where someone pointed out the Skinner box from the inside and dared you to take it away from him And then everyone else is just mad about the fact that the game is actually a team game and you really got to play with The team like you got to have five friends.

341
00:21:45,432 --> 00:21:46,980
Rym: or it's not that good of a game.

342
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:50,056
Rym: That's just like it's like every game the game before it in this vein.

343
00:21:50,097 --> 00:21:50,720
Rym: It's a team game.

344
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,199
Rym: You're playing a team game to win teams.

345
00:21:52,340 --> 00:22:01,092
Scott: If you're really good at a game or believe you're really good at a game and you're sad because you keep losing all the time And you keep blaming it on your team and your name is not Alexander Ovechkin.

346
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:03,539
Scott: You can go play a tiny-ass violin somewhere.

347
00:22:07,523 --> 00:22:12,886
Rym: So I got one last little news because this kind of happened today and it's just How are people so bad at this?

348
00:22:13,047 --> 00:22:23,320
Scott: Ubisoft which has had problems in the past which is like one of the worst game publishers There is maybe the worst even they're like damn and EA are the two worst game video game publishers of triple-a games.

349
00:22:23,661 --> 00:22:25,527
Rym: It's like on the other end of the spectrum.

350
00:22:25,547 --> 00:22:28,778
Rym: You got Blizzard who was just like by the numbers doing a blizzard.

351
00:22:28,818 --> 00:22:29,340
Scott: is Activision.

352
00:22:29,501 --> 00:22:30,326
Scott: They're not perfect.

353
00:22:30,366 --> 00:22:32,579
Scott: Yeah, but they're worse than they used to be.

354
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,280
Rym: Yeah But at the same time they're knocking everything that they focus on.

355
00:22:37,161 --> 00:22:38,826
Scott: Game publisher developer.

356
00:22:38,846 --> 00:22:40,291
Scott: that does everything right.

357
00:22:40,491 --> 00:22:41,193
Rym: everything right.

358
00:22:41,655 --> 00:22:46,375
Scott: the small team that made advance Wars That you mean Nintendo and it's not a small team.

359
00:22:46,556 --> 00:22:51,011
Scott: Yeah I guess the Zach Tronics guy who keeps making the programming games.

360
00:22:51,393 --> 00:22:53,240
Scott: Ah, he seems to self publish them.

361
00:22:53,381 --> 00:23:00,049
Rym: Anyway, Ubisoft put out a gamer survey to find out stuff about gamers And the first question it asks is if you're male or female.

362
00:23:00,831 --> 00:23:05,426
Rym: if you say female it immediately ends and says Thank you for taking the time to believe the survey.

363
00:23:05,486 --> 00:23:09,340
Rym: Unfortunately, your profile does not suit our profile for this survey.

364
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:09,942
Scott: All right.

365
00:23:09,983 --> 00:23:15,166
Scott: So first of all, if you're doing a survey and someone wants to give you free information Yeah, don't turn it away.

366
00:23:15,207 --> 00:23:16,112
Scott: Why would you turn it away?

367
00:23:16,132 --> 00:23:21,841
Scott: - Usually if you're running a certain your survey company, that's what you do You know.

368
00:23:21,861 --> 00:23:33,320
Scott: if you only want to know about like what dudes like and what you know various demographics old people young people You know Americans other people from other countries you do reports on the data you've collected.

369
00:23:33,441 --> 00:23:43,319
Scott: So when you're all done collecting all this data You can just be like select from Survey where gender equals M and you'll only get that data and it doesn't matter whether you collected the other data or not.

370
00:23:44,461 --> 00:23:50,540
Scott: So to filter it out, but also to tell the user you could even let them do the survey and just throw the data away.

371
00:23:50,942 --> 00:23:53,554
Rym: Yeah, but it's like I tell the user and but it's free data.

372
00:23:53,575 --> 00:23:54,580
Scott: Why wouldn't you just collect it?

373
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:59,440
Scott: But especially why would you why would you tell them and create this fiasco?

374
00:23:59,841 --> 00:24:05,798
Rym: Like we know that there's a problem with the how dumb are you women like that's?

375
00:24:06,098 --> 00:24:07,464
Scott: it's like well Ubisoft doesn't?

376
00:24:07,524 --> 00:24:11,000
Scott: Ubisoft is one of the bad publishers who true women poorly now.

377
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,872
Rym: They claimed a little while ago that quote there's a bug a bug.

378
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,681
Rym: There was an error in the setup of the survey Uh-huh.

379
00:24:17,942 --> 00:24:20,069
Rym: It is now resolved and available to everyone.

380
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:20,490
Rym: Uh-huh.

381
00:24:20,651 --> 00:24:22,236
Rym: Apologies for any confusion.

382
00:24:22,256 --> 00:24:22,778
Rym: Uh-huh.

383
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:30,395
Scott: Yeah Also anyone who's doing fucking surveys Why are you fucking helping Ubisoft by giving them your information?

384
00:24:30,415 --> 00:24:31,580
Scott: stop doing surveys for people.

385
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,148
Scott: The only survey you should be doing is the steam hardware survey.

386
00:24:34,188 --> 00:24:35,111
Rym: Yeah, that one's real important.

387
00:24:35,131 --> 00:24:37,840
Scott: Actually, don't do any other video game related surveys.

388
00:24:44,001 --> 00:24:45,064
Rym: Things of the day.

389
00:24:45,265 --> 00:24:50,421
Rym: I have to because the 4th of July was yesterday at least have one 4th of July themed thing and I Do.

390
00:24:50,441 --> 00:24:55,059
Scott: this is the best tweet somebody celebrating the birth of our nation by blowing up a small part of it.

391
00:24:55,942 --> 00:25:01,300
Rym: This tweet is titled all caps ahem who the fuck lit fireworks in Walmart?

392
00:25:01,641 --> 00:25:02,043
Scott: Why are there?

393
00:25:02,324 --> 00:25:03,690
Scott: I didn't know Walmart sold fireworks.

394
00:25:04,273 --> 00:25:08,044
Scott: I guess if you're in Florida they do Like New York.

395
00:25:08,084 --> 00:25:13,698
Rym: Yeah, okay, but someone set an entire fireworks aisle on fire in a Walmart.

396
00:25:14,059 --> 00:25:16,558
Scott: my hero I wonder what the insurance pay out it like.

397
00:25:16,578 --> 00:25:20,260
Rym: I Disapprove of what happened because that's dangerous and property destruction.

398
00:25:20,682 --> 00:25:23,613
Rym: But I approve of the tweet that I got to enjoy this in from.

399
00:25:23,633 --> 00:25:24,978
Scott: it's okay to do it to Walmart.

400
00:25:24,999 --> 00:25:25,340
Scott: fuck them.

401
00:25:25,865 --> 00:25:28,492
Rym: They're not even the worst anymore Like I would they're not.

402
00:25:28,532 --> 00:25:29,320
Scott: it's worse than Walmart.

403
00:25:29,822 --> 00:25:32,714
Rym: So I got a real thing of the day and you just got to see this.

404
00:25:32,794 --> 00:25:33,115
Rym: It's just.

405
00:25:33,135 --> 00:25:34,179
Rym: I tweeted it.

406
00:25:34,762 --> 00:25:38,517
Rym: I retweeted the thing and you should just click in here and see what's going on.

407
00:25:38,618 --> 00:25:42,733
Scott: after three clicks I realized what it was and and then didn't read didn't continue the.

408
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:46,486
Rym: I followed it to its source And it was kind of worth it.

409
00:25:46,506 --> 00:25:48,152
Scott: You really have no time there.

410
00:25:48,233 --> 00:25:49,297
Rym: It's only like 20 deep.

411
00:25:49,337 --> 00:25:50,866
Rym: like it's not that far I thought it was super deep.

412
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,095
Rym: No, it wasn't as deep as you expect.

413
00:25:52,135 --> 00:25:54,088
Scott: I mean after three I'm like, I haven't got time for this shit.

414
00:25:54,168 --> 00:25:54,450
Rym: Yep.

415
00:25:54,731 --> 00:25:57,366
Rym: But yeah, it was a few clicks in was like Oh, I see what's going on here.

416
00:25:57,406 --> 00:26:00,279
Scott: And then I was like, how far down does the rabbit hole go?

417
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,605
Rym: So you got a thing of the day?

418
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:07,569
Scott: Yeah, so this dude Commits a misdemeanor in this video.

419
00:26:07,589 --> 00:26:09,256
Scott: So crime on film here.

420
00:26:09,316 --> 00:26:09,899
Scott: Watch out.

421
00:26:11,081 --> 00:26:12,928
Scott: So they're at some bridge somewhere.

422
00:26:12,948 --> 00:26:22,840
Scott: I guess it's a car bridge that drives across like a river and He jumps off, but he's not doing the usual which would be bungee jumping or base jumping, right?

423
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,684
Scott: Because you need a you know.

424
00:26:23,704 --> 00:26:27,560
Scott: to span a bridge I guess counts as a span and you the s in base, right?

425
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,731
Scott: No, he's got a rope and is just a rope.

426
00:26:30,752 --> 00:26:33,644
Scott: So you're thinking whoa, that could be dangerous Just a rope.

427
00:26:33,985 --> 00:26:37,060
Scott: you usually you bungee jump with the bungee thing because then you won't die.

428
00:26:37,923 --> 00:26:50,785
Scott: But he jumps off in such a way So as to not bungee and die and yet or spider-man Gwen Stacy yank and die but instead to swing Majestically then.

429
00:26:50,805 --> 00:26:53,860
Rym: therefore part of this video is the face he's making.

430
00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:01,580
Scott: Yeah He's got his GoPro on a stick and he's got it in slow-mo and you can see his friends down at the bottom And I wish you would have kept videoing when the cops came and gave him the ticket.

431
00:27:03,042 --> 00:27:07,870
Rym: But yeah, if I were the cop I would give him the ticket and then I would ask him if I could come back when I Was off duty and do it.

432
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:08,739
Scott: I would totally do this.

433
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:12,459
Scott: Yeah, this seems great as long as I knew the river was deep enough and someone else did it first.

434
00:27:13,121 --> 00:27:20,660
Rym: It's the kind of thing we did when it when a grown-up, you know I did a lot of reckless things with friends like out in the woods were involving rope swings and jumping off a shit and whatever.

435
00:27:21,162 --> 00:27:25,999
Rym: But I had a very specific rule someone else had to do it and survive before I would do it no matter what it was.

436
00:27:26,423 --> 00:27:27,818
Scott: That's my rule for a lot of things.

437
00:27:28,462 --> 00:27:38,960
Rym: So like cybernetic implants I would do this or replacing my body with a robot body in the moment The book club book was long ago the Wheel of Time the first of the Wheel of Time.

438
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,768
Rym: I finished the 14th book of the Wheel of Time.

439
00:27:40,788 --> 00:27:41,611
Scott: Is that the last one?

440
00:27:42,274 --> 00:27:43,580
Rym: Ah, there's no more Wheel of Time.

441
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,446
Scott: I know you've gone around the whole wheel.

442
00:27:45,466 --> 00:27:46,690
Scott: Yeah, you're out of time.

443
00:27:47,252 --> 00:27:48,957
Rym: No more time done with time.

444
00:27:49,077 --> 00:27:49,900
Rym: I made my time.

445
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:50,755
Rym: My time is done.

446
00:27:52,440 --> 00:28:00,760
Rym: Move Randell tour and yeah, so the next book club book will be Oryx and Crake But it's much shorter than even one book of Wheel of Time.

447
00:28:01,161 --> 00:28:07,432
Scott: So even though we've been talking about this book for a long time and not actually doing the episode on it I'm gonna start reading it.

448
00:28:07,472 --> 00:28:09,165
Rym: probably like today I'm gonna start.

449
00:28:09,205 --> 00:28:11,540
Scott: we should be able to do the episode on it like in a couple weeks.

450
00:28:11,781 --> 00:28:15,920
Rym: In fact, if there's a lot of downtime in Connecticut, I might just finish it between traveling to and from Connecticut.

451
00:28:16,241 --> 00:28:16,602
Rym: Maybe.

452
00:28:16,622 --> 00:28:24,980
Rym: maybe the thing is it's a race because the next Prince of Nothing book comes out like any day But I have to reread so many princes of nothing.

453
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:32,880
Scott: So I a couple years ago reread the first trilogy so I don't need to reread that I did But I still have to reread again because I forgot half the proper nouns.

454
00:28:33,781 --> 00:28:36,715
Rym: Uh, I think a lot of them don't matter like you don't really do.

455
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:37,600
Scott: Yeah, what's an Ione?

456
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,379
Rym: They're the ones with the steel masks, right?

457
00:28:40,224 --> 00:28:42,721
Scott: And who are the evil like Sharam?

458
00:28:42,842 --> 00:28:47,020
Scott: know the the the the priests who wear like red and they're totally like evil like the Mafia.

459
00:28:47,782 --> 00:28:49,859
Scott: Oh the the priest the Wizards who are evil.

460
00:28:51,382 --> 00:28:54,213
Rym: That was the one of the Gnostic school or the anagogic schools.

461
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:54,996
Scott: Yeah, what is that?

462
00:28:55,076 --> 00:28:55,959
Scott: What does the tusks say?

463
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,078
Rym: Oh, no, we don't know what the fucking tough says.

464
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,475
Scott: Who's the guy who hangs out with the tusks?

465
00:29:02,021 --> 00:29:03,508
Scott: Beard guy the priest guy.

466
00:29:03,528 --> 00:29:05,878
Scott: Yeah, I don't remember his name the Pope guy.

467
00:29:05,938 --> 00:29:06,360
Scott: basically.

468
00:29:07,142 --> 00:29:09,048
Rym: Well, that's all complicated.

469
00:29:09,149 --> 00:29:12,198
Rym: after what happens in the first series I know but I'm just saying what's his name?

470
00:29:12,238 --> 00:29:13,366
Rym: that matter He's dead.

471
00:29:13,387 --> 00:29:14,458
Scott: Is he dead?

472
00:29:16,622 --> 00:29:17,545
Scott: I don't think he's dead.

473
00:29:18,368 --> 00:29:20,194
Rym: Did you read all the books that came out?

474
00:29:20,535 --> 00:29:21,016
Rym: Yes.

475
00:29:21,137 --> 00:29:22,080
Rym: Did I come before you?

476
00:29:24,641 --> 00:29:28,195
Rym: Anyway, a lot of people are dead by the end of the books that were written up to.

477
00:29:28,215 --> 00:29:29,420
Scott: pretty sure that guy's not dead.

478
00:29:29,541 --> 00:29:30,478
Rym: He's dead.

479
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,226
Scott: We'll talk about this after this.

480
00:29:32,246 --> 00:29:35,698
Rym: didn't he die at the end of the stuff the book we just read?

481
00:29:35,718 --> 00:29:37,228
Scott: no You're thinking about different guy.

482
00:29:37,249 --> 00:29:39,099
Rym: Uh maybe.

483
00:29:39,921 --> 00:29:44,440
Rym: Anyway, the prince of nothing is like our favorite fantasy series ever and we've done a bunch of.

484
00:29:44,601 --> 00:29:46,716
Scott: I have to put a huge content warning on.

485
00:29:46,756 --> 00:29:52,064
Scott: yeah Dude, who writes it is like mad Misogynistic.

486
00:29:52,246 --> 00:29:53,679
Scott: yeah the books reflect this.

487
00:29:54,402 --> 00:29:56,970
Scott: The books also have stuff that I probably like.

488
00:29:57,532 --> 00:30:02,929
Scott: if I saw in a movie I might get sick and usually I don't get sick Anything in a movie not even like each of the killer like we have.

489
00:30:02,969 --> 00:30:13,080
Rym: so interestingly Scott wheel of time does similar things later on Like when you start finding out about how compulsion works, it is the prince of nothing compulsion like a hundred percent.

490
00:30:13,261 --> 00:30:16,390
Rym: Oh, in fact, it's kind of worse because it's real bad.

491
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:18,517
Rym: If you try to take it out of someone's brain anyway.

492
00:30:18,958 --> 00:30:21,264
Rym: anyway Yeah, prince of nothing.

493
00:30:21,304 --> 00:30:24,274
Scott: Is that what the rod of you know, the oath rod?

494
00:30:24,635 --> 00:30:26,100
Rym: the oath rod does stuff like that.

495
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,778
Rym: The oath rod does a lot of bad things to you.

496
00:30:28,101 --> 00:30:35,066
Rym: Okay, this pain involved in the heartache and misery and shortened lifespans and yeah I am it's good bad news.

497
00:30:35,668 --> 00:30:37,514
Rym: But yeah, we really like the prince of nothing series.

498
00:30:37,975 --> 00:30:44,587
Scott: all all caveats notwithstanding it combines philosophy Wizards and history.

499
00:30:44,828 --> 00:30:47,800
Rym: Yep, and it's also a nice sort of sci-fi aliens.

500
00:30:48,061 --> 00:30:53,080
Scott: It's also a sort of mission at least and the bad guy is a sarcophagus inside of a tornado.

501
00:30:54,128 --> 00:30:58,933
Rym: It's got some Tolkien Deconstruction like what would elves really be like like that kind of thing like for real.

502
00:30:58,973 --> 00:30:59,716
Rym: what else be lost?

503
00:30:59,736 --> 00:31:00,740
Scott: some barbarians also.

504
00:31:00,941 --> 00:31:02,517
Rym: Yeah, skill Vandy barbaria.

505
00:31:04,201 --> 00:31:06,994
Rym: It's also a very quotable series track a step.

506
00:31:07,315 --> 00:31:17,911
Rym: Yeah Anyway, so yeah We're gonna read orcs and Craig and we're gonna do a review of it Even though everyone's telling me I should have done the Handmaid's Tale.

507
00:31:17,971 --> 00:31:19,820
Rym: It's more relevant to modern American politics.

508
00:31:19,921 --> 00:31:21,289
Scott: Whatever just read all the.

509
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:22,175
Scott: just read all this shit.

510
00:31:22,316 --> 00:31:22,920
Scott: Yeah, I got time.

511
00:31:23,462 --> 00:31:28,445
Rym: Otherwise, we're gonna be a ConnectiCon this weekend Like it's happening.

512
00:31:28,946 --> 00:31:29,669
Rym: We're gonna be there.

513
00:31:29,709 --> 00:31:31,013
Rym: We're running the panels department.

514
00:31:31,776 --> 00:31:33,060
Rym: We're doing some panels as well.

515
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:38,068
Rym: I forget when they are but we're doing a Anime foreign anime openers on Friday.

516
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:42,200
Rym: We're doing more foreign anime openers on Saturday.

517
00:31:42,945 --> 00:31:47,507
Rym: We're doing a professional Podcasting and live streaming on Sunday.

518
00:31:48,148 --> 00:31:51,757
Rym: We're doing Atari game design and we're doing writing game rules.

519
00:31:52,238 --> 00:31:53,702
Rym: I think that's it Cuz.

520
00:31:53,762 --> 00:31:55,588
Rym: I just didn't really want to do a lot of panels this year.

521
00:31:56,271 --> 00:31:57,996
Rym: Otherwise, why don't you smart people?

522
00:31:58,016 --> 00:31:59,000
Rym: We know are doing panels.

523
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:00,990
Rym: We made the panel.

524
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:02,100
Rym: Well, I made the panel schedule.

525
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,220
Rym: I think it's actually a the best panel schedule this con has ever had in terms of content.

526
00:32:07,024 --> 00:32:07,105
Rym: Like.

527
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:16,879
Rym: I'm actually pretty proud of it and if you try to use the website that ConnectiCon has to let you see that schedule I Highly recommend you complain to them about the fun.

528
00:32:18,181 --> 00:32:23,660
Rym: So the first speedrun I ever saw that sort of made me really realize what the hell that was.

529
00:32:24,021 --> 00:32:26,413
Rym: Was that Mario 3 thing that we saw at RIT?

530
00:32:26,574 --> 00:32:27,820
Scott: This is so long ago.

531
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,570
Scott: It's not any Mario 3 but that you've ever seen.

532
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,400
Rym: basically like earliest days of you.

533
00:32:31,762 --> 00:32:38,589
Scott: it was pretty much just world 8 1. right that you know the final world and It was a more than a 1.

534
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:39,980
Rym: it was a few bits of world 8.

535
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:45,260
Scott: Yeah, it was a bunch of world 8 and normally I would just like I think a speedrun you'd fly over the p-wing or something.

536
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,106
Scott: But he didn't do that.

537
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:53,100
Scott: All right, I mean it's an auto scroller But this he's super optimized like jumping on the cannonballs in like a ridiculous way.

538
00:32:53,622 --> 00:32:58,059
Scott: It was like basically a miracle that the person could do this because it turned out a person couldn't do it.

539
00:32:58,401 --> 00:32:59,830
Rym: That at least in that case though.

540
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:01,138
Scott: I'm sure maybe a person can do it now.

541
00:33:01,588 --> 00:33:11,530
Rym: Yeah but that was a tool assisted speedrun and it was interesting because up until that point when I thought of the like I kind of Had the idea of like a speedrun because it wasn't like gamer.

542
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:14,260
Rym: pop culture had not really crystallized all these ideas.

543
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,660
Scott: I mean there were people playing video games for speed.

544
00:33:16,981 --> 00:33:21,096
Scott: Metroid told you how long it took for you to beat it and people tried to get faster times.

545
00:33:21,257 --> 00:33:22,060
Rym: people set records.

546
00:33:22,271 --> 00:33:23,583
Scott: Yeah There were very contests.

547
00:33:23,684 --> 00:33:30,740
Scott: there are various games that had time as opposed to score and people you know had always been doing high score attack But people were also doing time attack.

548
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:41,685
Scott: It just hadn't become a phenomenon until games done quick really made it into a community With you know to event two major events every year one of which is going on right now For some.

549
00:33:41,725 --> 00:33:44,480
Scott: according to Rym, we've never done an episode on this.

550
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,971
Rym: I couldn't find an episode on this.

551
00:33:46,112 --> 00:33:49,693
Scott: if we're wrong Blame Rym, how does that my fault?

552
00:33:49,714 --> 00:33:50,598
Scott: We've done this episode.

553
00:33:50,639 --> 00:34:02,521
Rym: All right now there was a community for this before a GDQ sort of did its thing, but you kind of had to know and People were still sort of arguing and fighting about like what counted what the terminology was Like.

554
00:34:02,561 --> 00:34:03,988
Rym: how exactly do you measure this?

555
00:34:04,249 --> 00:34:06,278
Rym: which emulators are like legit for it?

556
00:34:06,318 --> 00:34:06,720
Scott: streaming?

557
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:15,536
Scott: Also made it a big thing because you could see people You know practicing and that made other people get hooked on Practicing and watching other people and it let people share their techniques with each other.

558
00:34:15,877 --> 00:34:21,056
Scott: before that People would have to record and like share videos direct directly with each other.

559
00:34:21,077 --> 00:34:23,568
Scott: that Mario 3 thing We watched was like an mp4.

560
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:24,472
Scott: We download.

561
00:34:24,632 --> 00:34:26,219
Scott: Yeah, it might have even been an AVI.

562
00:34:26,784 --> 00:34:28,598
Rym: This was like free YouTube days guys.

563
00:34:29,282 --> 00:34:34,639
Rym: So what happened was basically now that there's a community around it live streaming is a thing.

564
00:34:35,002 --> 00:34:42,480
Rym: YouTube exists and the internet exists and everyone has access to it and Anime and gaming and all these conventions are like super easy and widespread.

565
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:51,219
Rym: It was like the perfect time for an explosion and it got to the point of where people started breaking records That no one ever thought would be broke.

566
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:57,275
Scott: I mean it really exploded like three or four years ago and it just keeps getting bigger and bigger Constantly every single year.

567
00:34:57,315 --> 00:35:03,540
Rym: every year I look at the schedule of a GDQ and I'm shocked by at least one of the attempts that they're about to make and it's like.

568
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,264
Scott: You think it's like.

569
00:35:04,324 --> 00:35:06,495
Scott: are there really new games they can go after?

570
00:35:06,556 --> 00:35:09,186
Scott: are there really ways They can improve upon the games.

571
00:35:09,226 --> 00:35:09,587
Scott: They're already.

572
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:16,751
Scott: they're still improving Final Fantasy for speed run Right and then on top of that there's always even for one game.

573
00:35:16,771 --> 00:35:17,935
Scott: There'll be so many different modes.

574
00:35:18,075 --> 00:35:24,596
Rym: any percent hundred percent Blindfolded it's like really into that hundred percent bionic commando in 30 minutes.

575
00:35:24,837 --> 00:35:30,591
Scott: I just watched blindfolded symphony of the night today, holy Crap, it's like.

576
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:31,420
Scott: are you kidding me?

577
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,980
Scott: This dude couldn't see he had problems in the library buying stuff.

578
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:40,299
Scott: But the point is is like he still beat symphony of the night without seeing only audio.

579
00:35:40,339 --> 00:35:43,774
Rym: dude I'm not a hundred percent guaranteed to beat it non blindfolded.

580
00:35:43,854 --> 00:35:47,616
Rym: if I have all the time in the world I am I haven't played in a long time.

581
00:35:47,636 --> 00:35:48,340
Rym: I think I might die.

582
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:52,019
Rym: It's not a hard game now, but I'm sure I die a bunch if I just picks up right now.

583
00:35:52,382 --> 00:35:54,879
Rym: I haven't played a metroidvania in at least three years.

584
00:35:55,981 --> 00:36:01,280
Scott: Yeah, I mean, yeah, I might die maybe in the upside-down castle if I sort of rush and don't take it easy.

585
00:36:01,561 --> 00:36:05,813
Rym: But I remember was also interesting about that speedrun that Mario 3 one that we saw.

586
00:36:05,853 --> 00:36:08,381
Rym: that really sort of like got me interested in This.

587
00:36:08,422 --> 00:36:11,000
Rym: that's why I got into the community in those days not doing it.

588
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,124
Rym: I'll never be that good now.

589
00:36:12,184 --> 00:36:26,671
Rym: but like finding them and watching them and learning about them was that it wasn't just a Like Fox only Final Destination style like heavyset mouth breather staring at the screen not saying anything Perfect run doing no extraneous actions.

590
00:36:27,273 --> 00:36:28,296
Rym: This was parkour.

591
00:36:28,357 --> 00:36:28,818
Rym: This was a show.

592
00:36:30,202 --> 00:36:34,400
Rym: This was someone showing off taking risks, right?

593
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:41,420
Scott: cuz I mean think you had this video game and you have to beat it as fast as you can and You have to do this without hacking the game.

594
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:48,800
Scott: It's like normally you'd hack the game right or you know, you do something like that But no only by pressing the buttons on the controller and doing nothing else.

595
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,322
Scott: You're not allowed.

596
00:36:49,463 --> 00:36:55,271
Scott: you can push the buttons on the console to like the reset button maybe depending on the rules But you all you can do is push buttons.

597
00:36:55,573 --> 00:36:56,920
Scott: So how can you beat the game faster?

598
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:03,439
Scott: You think like Mario 1 it's like well hold B and right and jump and don't ever let go of right or B Unless you got to shoot a fireball or something.

599
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:09,360
Scott: Yeah It's like you know that is that really as fast as you can go and then you start to see things like basic techniques.

600
00:37:09,543 --> 00:37:17,080
Scott: for example in They have the thing where you turn backwards do a back dash and then bring your shield out to cancel the animation.

601
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:31,620
Scott: so you go and You go really really fast because the back dash is really fast and by canceling it with the shield You can just keep back dashing constantly without you know The sort of ending animation of it and go whoosh much faster than you could run just going forward.

602
00:37:31,881 --> 00:37:40,800
Scott: Yeah, suddenly when you see someone playing Castlevania Symphony tonight, they're always going backwards going And that's like beginner mode of speedrun.

603
00:37:41,381 --> 00:37:42,545
Rym: yep, and then what?

604
00:37:42,705 --> 00:37:43,828
Rym: what this is culminated into?

605
00:37:43,908 --> 00:38:02,000
Rym: and I guess my favorite thing now is that the community is so big that there Can be races with two three four people playing a multi-hour game in a race Sometimes even taking different routes, so you don't even know who's ahead until the end and they finish within seconds of each other.

606
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:07,876
Rym: Yep, like that is the point that we're in today, and they're optimizing so much to where they're like.

607
00:38:07,896 --> 00:38:10,420
Scott: ah do that You know I'm doing the safety strat.

608
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,608
Scott: It only loses like two seconds versus the.

609
00:38:12,789 --> 00:38:20,256
Scott: you know as she means that when they're not doing the safety strat because it's not AGDQ or SGDQ they do this other thing that is much riskier.

610
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:22,102
Scott: just to save two seconds They're gonna cuz.

611
00:38:22,183 --> 00:38:24,090
Rym: you know some people are going for the world record like you.

612
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:28,150
Scott: try over and over those two seconds keep adding up right two seconds here two seconds there.

613
00:38:28,231 --> 00:38:29,458
Scott: suddenly you're a minute faster.

614
00:38:29,478 --> 00:38:37,820
Rym: and But because of the performance aspect of it This is like the generation where AGDQ made this happen by turning it into a performance.

615
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:40,593
Rym: The tool assisted runs are like their own sort of thing.

616
00:38:40,934 --> 00:38:47,120
Rym: and be like you know I did it a million times and the video you see of his world record is the best of them.

617
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:55,303
Rym: It's very different when it is a performance where there's a human in front of an audience a giant audience live Performing for

618
00:38:55,343 --> 00:39:08,207
Scott: you right, but the the tool assisted ones are actually really important because even though like you know You might not be impressed with them because a person didn't do it It took a lot of work to make it because a person sat there going through the game frame by frame Figuring out the best way to do

619
00:39:08,268 --> 00:39:08,348
Rym: it.

620
00:39:08,468 --> 00:39:12,119
Scott: Yeah, even though it didn't take a lot as much skill It took a lot more effort.

621
00:39:12,621 --> 00:39:20,291
Scott: But also by doing those tool assisted speed runs it gives the people doing the by hand real speed runs Something to look at and say aha.

622
00:39:20,553 --> 00:39:21,760
Scott: That's the fastest way.

623
00:39:22,281 --> 00:39:25,531
Scott: Let's see how much of that it's possible for a human to do.

624
00:39:25,551 --> 00:39:30,760
Scott: and there's a lot of like frame perfect things that people can Do very consistently because they're gods.

625
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:32,889
Rym: Now now I think we were on.

626
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:34,640
Rym: I was watching one of the earlier ones.

627
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:44,228
Rym: it was the the most recent link between worlds DS run and Well 3ds and the guy was just sort of talking and he gets at one point where he's like All right, this move coming up.

628
00:39:45,114 --> 00:39:47,824
Rym: I gotta be too almost frame perfect.

629
00:39:48,044 --> 00:39:57,919
Rym: and then they start talking to each other about how many frames they have to input the command and then one of Them laughs and points out something that hey coming up is the other one the frame perfect one be.

630
00:39:58,481 --> 00:40:05,220
Rym: Literally you have to input a control on one specific frame or it fails, right?

631
00:40:05,743 --> 00:40:06,025
Rym: So

632
00:40:06,065 --> 00:40:21,660
Scott: for people to understand when you program a video game Almost every video game is programmed using this very similar coding structure where you have a loop the main loop and basically The loop starts and a bunch of code gets executed the computers doing math math math math math math math math math math.

633
00:40:22,323 --> 00:40:26,860
Scott: And then when it gets to the very bottom of the loop, it basically has to draw the screen.

634
00:40:27,141 --> 00:40:38,760
Scott: So if your screen is, you know, 1080p's you've got 1080 by you know pixels Right to draw and it basically has to create in memory, you know, which color it goes in all those pixels.

635
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:41,189
Scott: So this pixels green this pixels blue and so on.

636
00:40:41,791 --> 00:40:48,460
Scott: and then it puts that you know Array of color information to the video card and then it gets drawn on the monitor.

637
00:40:49,102 --> 00:40:57,407
Scott: And if your game is running at say 60 FPS, that is loop has to go all the way through 60 times every second.

638
00:40:57,688 --> 00:41:01,739
Scott: also in this loop is the code that says are they pressing a?

639
00:41:02,642 --> 00:41:15,251
Scott: If they're pressing a make Mario jump if he's on the ground obvious, right, you know, so that code is happening 60 times a second which means in any given second You could press a on the.

640
00:41:15,452 --> 00:41:18,323
Scott: you know, there it's cut into 60 slices Right.

641
00:41:18,584 --> 00:41:19,787
Scott: So 160th.

642
00:41:20,008 --> 00:41:23,659
Scott: if it's a 60 FPS game what every 60th of a second?

643
00:41:24,662 --> 00:41:25,500
Scott: It would be a difference.

644
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:31,451
Scott: So if you push a on the first 60th or the second 60th It's impossible to push a on anywhere in between.

645
00:41:31,492 --> 00:41:32,958
Scott: that because it's the loop.

646
00:41:32,998 --> 00:41:35,126
Scott: go, you know The loop executes one at a time, right?

647
00:41:35,708 --> 00:41:39,200
Scott: So you have 60 chances every second in a 60 FPS game.

648
00:41:39,967 --> 00:41:51,800
Scott: So if it's a 30 FPS game You have 30 chances every second to press the button and you have to press it on an exact very specific One of those loops like that loop that the tenth one is the one we had to push the button.

649
00:41:52,463 --> 00:41:55,279
Scott: That's how hard this is to do a frame perfect thing.

650
00:41:55,583 --> 00:41:55,750
Rym: Yeah.

651
00:41:57,303 --> 00:41:59,863
Scott: So it's it's like oh my god, you know You have you.

652
00:41:59,983 --> 00:42:06,354
Scott: you have one second in the game and on this one like fraction of that second That's when you had to press the button.

653
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:07,904
Rym: now I guess what also I like.

654
00:42:07,944 --> 00:42:09,230
Rym: but this is sort of a wider point.

655
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:13,807
Rym: that sort of it's affecting a lot of people who make Content or do streams or anything on the internet.

656
00:42:14,168 --> 00:42:30,720
Rym: but because live streaming has such a strong community now And because these speedrun people are like pushing this art as far as they can already Unless you are like of that caliber like you have to be so good to even warrant anyone watching you at this point.

657
00:42:31,054 --> 00:42:34,860
Scott: well They seem to have like this big community going on and you can go to their website.

658
00:42:35,102 --> 00:42:43,022
Scott: And even though if you were to say start, you know There are always people when I watch this who like oh we got a new guy playing Super Metroid Is he?

659
00:42:43,123 --> 00:42:45,200
Scott: Super Metroid is the most speedrun game?

660
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:48,529
Scott: But someone will just start doing it and they could.

661
00:42:48,549 --> 00:42:52,240
Scott: they learned everything from the previous people by watching them and they have skills.

662
00:42:52,542 --> 00:42:59,440
Scott: So they like level up and become Just as good if not better than the people already doing it in a short a matter of time because they have skills.

663
00:42:59,982 --> 00:43:06,926
Scott: but there are people with less skills who choose less popular games and Because there's less competition there.

664
00:43:06,946 --> 00:43:10,820
Scott: right and you think you know, how about you pick some weirdo game?

665
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:15,260
Rym: Well, the best example of this ever watched the speedrun on a GDQ of super pitfall.

666
00:43:15,902 --> 00:43:24,420
Rym: It is hilarious because that game is so bad and so broken and so glitchy and the guy doing the speedrun Knows literally everything there is to know about the game.

667
00:43:24,526 --> 00:43:29,442
Scott: I mean I've seen speedruns on there like people were doing like Lion King and it's like How many.

668
00:43:29,462 --> 00:43:30,789
Scott: and there's like a community of people.

669
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:35,228
Scott: like it's probably only less than 10 people But it's like they're the Lion King speedrunners.

670
00:43:35,268 --> 00:43:46,295
Scott: Like there's that many people on earth who are like putting effort into playing that game as fast as possible and they send someone to the Multiple people to the games done quick and you watch them play it.

671
00:43:46,355 --> 00:43:50,335
Scott: and it's like wow It only took like 10 people to optimize the hell out of this game.

672
00:43:50,897 --> 00:43:51,400
Scott: Holy shit.

673
00:43:51,922 --> 00:44:04,226
Scott: and it's like so no matter you know, you can get into this it with a lower level of skill because even if you can't Even if you're not the person who can push the button with frame perfect timing You can still contribute in many ways.

674
00:44:04,287 --> 00:44:05,811
Scott: right by simply trying it.

675
00:44:06,092 --> 00:44:08,900
Scott: you can find tricks to help the guy who can execute them.

676
00:44:09,201 --> 00:44:10,727
Scott: Yeah, you know you can do the top.

677
00:44:10,767 --> 00:44:14,167
Scott: the tool assisted speedrun to figure everything out, you know You can.

678
00:44:14,473 --> 00:44:17,960
Scott: you know There's so many things you can do in this community if you want to if that's your interest.

679
00:44:18,401 --> 00:44:24,763
Scott: The thing is ice is one of those hobbies where I think can only be meaningful if you dedicate a huge amount of time To it like you.

680
00:44:24,803 --> 00:44:25,708
Scott: make it your thing.

681
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:27,800
Rym: You can't dabble you can't you know.

682
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,107
Scott: Do other too many other hobbies like.

683
00:44:30,147 --> 00:44:34,480
Scott: if you're also like an anime fan and you're making a webcomic you can't be also speedrunning.

684
00:44:35,403 --> 00:44:47,498
Scott: Right, but if you're only speedrunning I notice a lot of the speedrun people speedrun multiple games because once you sort of get the skills of speedrunning You can sort of do a lot of similar games or a lot of games to the same system.

685
00:44:47,578 --> 00:44:54,740
Scott: or you know You can really work yourself up and you know get a huge repertoire and not just concentrate on one game only.

686
00:44:54,760 --> 00:45:05,260
Rym: Yeah I guess my favorite speedruns now are the live Performance ones with good commentary like someone who is kind of talking about the game or doing something interesting while they're playing.

687
00:45:05,361 --> 00:45:07,260
Rym: It's not just the speedrun.

688
00:45:07,481 --> 00:45:10,731
Scott: I like the ones where there's just there are things in the game.

689
00:45:10,771 --> 00:45:12,637
Scott: that is that you dislike don't think of.

690
00:45:12,678 --> 00:45:17,200
Scott: right like a boring One is like just he runs to the right as fast as the game lets him and jumps and everything.

691
00:45:17,802 --> 00:45:28,920
Rym: the more weird stuff like the Final Fantasy 4 one where they like they got the random seed in a certain way and then He knew like what every encounter would be along the way for like hours of this game.

692
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:37,903
Scott: Yeah any the weirder trick you found the more fascinating thing that you way to speed up this game that you have discovered and That's awesome.

693
00:45:37,923 --> 00:45:39,188
Scott: Er to look at right.

694
00:45:39,229 --> 00:45:41,820
Scott: that makes it more interesting from a spectators perspective.

695
00:45:42,041 --> 00:45:45,251
Rym: Yep, and I do appreciate I think I hate to say this.

696
00:45:45,292 --> 00:45:54,262
Rym: I think the showmanship of a GDQ is Getting to the point where it started surpassing a lot of what the competitive game circuit does Like.

697
00:45:54,302 --> 00:45:58,034
Rym: take your average fighting game tournament versus your average live streamer event last year.

698
00:45:58,054 --> 00:46:07,324
Rym: events tend to have better Production values and better announcing and everything, but it might be a side effect of the fact that there aren't as many Actual events like.

699
00:46:07,344 --> 00:46:09,933
Scott: it's not like a ladder as a charity organization.

700
00:46:09,973 --> 00:46:11,800
Scott: It's not like a profit organization.

701
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:14,674
Rym: That's you know, yeah, but I'm saying they do a really good job.

702
00:46:14,895 --> 00:46:23,826
Scott: Yeah, and it is I know that I know you know I know the people doing it right and they're like the people who do that kind of stuff like at a pax or at another Convention, but that is really good at it.

703
00:46:23,846 --> 00:46:28,420
Scott: Yeah, but they're doing it, you know volunteering because it's you know, they want to help it out.

704
00:46:29,761 --> 00:46:34,176
Rym: So the other thing I'm enjoying lately is the the weird mode stream.

705
00:46:34,316 --> 00:46:44,548
Rym: a lot of speed runs Like the example I came up with that no one's blindfold to p1c Or like mario 2. you're not allowed to run Like that kind of nonsense.

706
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:45,554
Rym: It's basically gum.

707
00:46:45,574 --> 00:46:46,580
Rym: Take deathmatch, right?

708
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:53,325
Scott: It's like, you know, you can just make things more interesting, you know blindfolded punch-out, you know started off as like well I can sort of get to Mike Tyson.

709
00:46:53,345 --> 00:46:54,510
Scott: then they were beating Mike Tyson.

710
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:57,220
Scott: No problem the next year blindfolded, right?

711
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:57,821
Scott: Now they're doing.

712
00:46:58,002 --> 00:47:01,352
Scott: now the guy just beat blindfolded Symphony in the night, you know, what?

713
00:47:01,493 --> 00:47:03,760
Scott: what's next thing like well blindfolded Super Metroid.

714
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:07,775
Rym: It's like I don't wait for the point where guys like instead of controller.

715
00:47:07,895 --> 00:47:09,100
Rym: I'm manipulating the wires.

716
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:11,231
Rym: I've shoved them into my fingers, right?

717
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:12,840
Scott: The 2p1c is really good.

718
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:16,975
Scott: We get two people on one controller and so one person's got the arrows another person has the buttons.

719
00:47:17,356 --> 00:47:19,484
Rym: That's really fun Especially when they're still.

720
00:47:19,524 --> 00:47:21,713
Scott: how much do they practice moves, right?

721
00:47:21,733 --> 00:47:23,039
Scott: It's like they practice that much.

722
00:47:23,865 --> 00:47:25,782
Scott: Well, it's like if you both you know think about it.

723
00:47:25,802 --> 00:47:31,469
Scott: if I play this game and I get the perfect muscle memory in my left and right hand and you get the Same exact muscle memory.
