1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:13,360
Scott: It's Tuesday October 10th, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,510
Scott: We will discuss many old and varied Atari game.

3
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:19,927
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:21,613 --> 00:00:28,840
Rym: so today at my job I came to a Conclusion that has somewhat disheartened me.

5
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,845
Scott: This is not new information.

6
00:00:30,885 --> 00:00:32,107
Scott: You knew this before.

7
00:00:32,249 --> 00:00:32,549
Scott: what did?

8
00:00:33,513 --> 00:00:34,998
Rym: No, no, I think the difference.

9
00:00:35,098 --> 00:00:37,486
Rym: I knew the fact that I've discovered today.

10
00:00:37,587 --> 00:00:38,490
Rym: I knew that it was true.

11
00:00:39,275 --> 00:00:45,887
Rym: I did not realize the absolute magnitude of the fact or the situation I am in.

12
00:00:45,907 --> 00:01:05,309
Rym: you see I Have discovered that I am a little bit overqualified For the position I hold at my company meaning I could train a monkey to do my job And people who are in the exact same position of me as me know less about computers than my mom.

13
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:14,150
Rym: Aha Take a long story short Guy, I got to do a project real quick thing got to do something to some PCs.

14
00:01:14,631 --> 00:01:20,810
Rym: So a guy at my office who has the same position as me who apparently knows about this is supposed to.

15
00:01:21,352 --> 00:01:24,607
Rym: You know take me down to the lab show me what needs to be done and I can go off and do it.

16
00:01:24,828 --> 00:01:34,322
Rym: All right so it's a terminal emulator kind of like telnet hyper terminal and You've got to make a new icon that points to a different IP address.

17
00:01:34,462 --> 00:01:35,064
Rym: No big deal.

18
00:01:35,626 --> 00:02:03,635
Rym: So he shows me an excruciating somewhat incorrect detail how to do this and the way he shows me is Copying the shortcut and renaming it and then going into the shortcut that he just made which points to the same place as the one He just made a copy of changing the settings saving it and then running it to which I said but won't that change the settings on the program because the shortcuts both point at the same place where the Configuration data is that you changed?

19
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:07,786
Rym: and his response was you know, we had a problem with that before.

20
00:02:07,866 --> 00:02:12,470
Rym: you think that'll solve it And I about beat my head against the desk.

21
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:14,032
Scott: God,

22
00:02:14,555 --> 00:02:37,200
Rym: I could go into great detail exactly why this was done, but It's weird how I went from a position where I was basically the head sysadmin of like 300 Linux Machines and I was a cosas admin on a whole bunch of critical servers and I helped manage a data center and a raised floor to Basically doing more on work yet.

23
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,109
Rym: I get paid more money and have better benefits doing it.

24
00:02:40,651 --> 00:02:46,450
Scott: We really need to make a company that goes around to other companies and make sure this kind of stupidity doesn't happen.

25
00:02:46,711 --> 00:02:48,678
Rym: I don't know what to what to think or do.

26
00:02:48,698 --> 00:02:50,345
Rym: I don't know either.

27
00:02:50,365 --> 00:02:51,690
Rym: This just isn't cool.

28
00:02:52,152 --> 00:02:55,570
Scott: I mean in other professions, I mean if you're a plumber, right?

29
00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:00,486
Scott: You don't go to other plumbers and say wow that guy doesn't know how to plumb.

30
00:03:00,767 --> 00:03:01,830
Scott: what's he doing plumbing?

31
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:14,670
Scott: you know if you're on if you work for a company in which does a bunch of copy machine repairmen You know it I can't imagine that one guy actually knows how to repair copiers and the other guys that don't know.

32
00:03:15,171 --> 00:03:19,988
Scott: You know all of those guys there know how to repair copiers and you call for your copy to copier to be repaired.

33
00:03:20,008 --> 00:03:21,233
Scott: a guy Shows up.

34
00:03:21,293 --> 00:03:22,358
Scott: It's always a different guy.

35
00:03:22,378 --> 00:03:23,624
Scott: They always know what the hell they're doing.

36
00:03:23,865 --> 00:03:24,770
Scott: You know, they do the job.

37
00:03:25,251 --> 00:03:32,190
Scott: Why is it in the IT industry that we know what the hell we're doing and most people don't have a clue?

38
00:03:32,694 --> 00:03:48,589
Rym: I mean I complained a lot about IBM but I got to say most of my complaints were with the company as a whole and The employees I ended up interacting with outside of my own department because the people in my department Pretty much knew what they were doing and we're pretty cool.

39
00:03:49,392 --> 00:03:56,369
Rym: I mean a lot of them had a lot of skills that really aren't so common anymore and by and large They were interesting people.

40
00:03:57,092 --> 00:03:59,220
Rym: They they were interested in the weird stuff.

41
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:07,390
Rym: I did and when they asked me a technical question They not only expected a technical answer, but they took my advice into consideration.

42
00:04:08,451 --> 00:04:12,407
Rym: Like if they wanted something Linux, they'd come to me and be like, hey, is this feasible?

43
00:04:12,468 --> 00:04:12,729
Rym: or hey?

44
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:13,994
Rym: What do you know about this?

45
00:04:14,074 --> 00:04:17,589
Rym: and they'd listen this company's like Linux was the fuck.

46
00:04:19,752 --> 00:04:21,257
Rym: Now there are smart people at this company.

47
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:24,849
Rym: I gave a guy Ubuntu and he is all about this.

48
00:04:24,929 --> 00:04:28,962
Rym: now It's just uh, I don't know what to say.

49
00:04:28,982 --> 00:04:31,410
Rym: I could I should just quit and get a better job.

50
00:04:31,491 --> 00:04:33,429
Rym: I could probably make twice as much money as I make now.

51
00:04:33,971 --> 00:04:38,705
Scott: So my job right on do anything and I could also probably making twice as much money somewhere else.

52
00:04:39,467 --> 00:04:40,409
Scott: I got an email today.

53
00:04:41,571 --> 00:04:43,297
Scott: Holy crap, did they fire you now?

54
00:04:43,497 --> 00:04:44,340
Rym: Did they give you work?

55
00:04:45,062 --> 00:04:46,327
Scott: No kind of not really.

56
00:04:46,627 --> 00:04:47,370
Scott: Well, I've had work.

57
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:50,265
Scott: I just haven't been doing it because no one cares if I do it or not.

58
00:04:50,306 --> 00:04:51,110
Scott: No one got attention.

59
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:53,480
Rym: I'll trade you you realize every day for the last two weeks.

60
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,615
Rym: I've asked my boss directly and straight up Is there any work for me to do?

61
00:04:58,157 --> 00:04:59,200
Rym: I'll do something.

62
00:04:59,361 --> 00:05:01,167
Rym: Give me something to do and I'll do it.

63
00:05:01,207 --> 00:05:01,889
Rym: You're paying me.

64
00:05:02,792 --> 00:05:08,590
Scott: Yeah, I have a few projects to be working on but they don't have deadlines and no one pays attention or cares.

65
00:05:08,972 --> 00:05:11,750
Rym: No one talks to see everyone acts like they're so busy at my company.

66
00:05:11,991 --> 00:05:16,150
Rym: But then they offer my services and not to sound big-headed, but I'm a badass.

67
00:05:16,632 --> 00:05:20,830
Rym: I can do anything they asked me to do and they just don't take advantage of me at all.

68
00:05:21,051 --> 00:05:23,384
Rym: But yet they complain constantly that they're under deadlines.

69
00:05:23,424 --> 00:05:24,410
Rym: They can't finish anything.

70
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:28,582
Scott: Anyway, the email I got today was concerning a project that did.

71
00:05:28,642 --> 00:05:31,410
Scott: I worked at the most recent work that I actually did.

72
00:05:31,571 --> 00:05:40,408
Scott: I actually did something, you know about a month ago I and I made this new website, but I didn't do any CSS because they hired some designers or anything.

73
00:05:40,448 --> 00:05:40,829
Scott: So it's good.

74
00:05:41,231 --> 00:05:41,775
Rym: I don't like just.

75
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:45,434
Scott: it's just crappy ass plain HTML.

76
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:52,393
Scott: it looks like it looks really bad because it's just a form that's completely Unstyled or anything.

77
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:59,169
Scott: It's just you know form input input input input slash form and it's a bunch of forms and links and that's it.

78
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:03,710
Scott: So they're like, yeah, we're putting there's a new server coming this week.

79
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:08,410
Scott: We're putting that thing up on it by the end of the week and it was a CC to me.

80
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:11,190
Scott: It was actually to someone else because they were having to set up.

81
00:06:12,433 --> 00:06:20,469
Rym: This happened to you where someone will email someone else with a bunch of important stuff That you that you haven't heard of before and they CC you but they don't mention you.

82
00:06:21,071 --> 00:06:22,817
Rym: So you have the sense of all.

83
00:06:22,857 --> 00:06:25,204
Rym: right was ICC because they want me to do something.

84
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:26,528
Scott: So I sent an email.

85
00:06:26,589 --> 00:06:26,910
Scott: I'm like.

86
00:06:28,031 --> 00:06:35,016
Scott: You guys know that that thing isn't CSS, right and you know that You know some.

87
00:06:35,258 --> 00:06:36,888
Scott: you know, I designed this thing.

88
00:06:36,928 --> 00:06:43,296
Scott: basically I offered to make this thing because I was kind of interested in making it and They said okay go to it.

89
00:06:43,356 --> 00:06:46,810
Scott: So I did but I did it without any input from the people who are using it.

90
00:06:46,931 --> 00:06:53,109
Scott: So I'm like, yeah, and maybe you know We should have someone who's actually gonna end up using this thing look at it to make sure it's what they want.

91
00:06:54,571 --> 00:06:57,143
Scott: And I was like is this server a production server or whatever?

92
00:06:57,183 --> 00:07:02,425
Scott: They're like, oh, yeah The new company websites going up Saturday night blah blah blah blah.

93
00:07:02,466 --> 00:07:06,821
Scott: I'm like, ah I'm like, can you maybe keep me in the loop on things?

94
00:07:06,941 --> 00:07:07,382
Scott: maybe?

95
00:07:07,924 --> 00:07:13,787
Scott: so now they today I Started getting kept in the loop on things and it's just a bunch of useless emails.

96
00:07:14,148 --> 00:07:14,530
Rym: good job.

97
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:18,565
Scott: So it's like they were giving me out of the loop and how I'm in it and I thought it's nothing.

98
00:07:18,846 --> 00:07:19,670
Rym: There's really no loop.

99
00:07:20,631 --> 00:07:22,761
Scott: It's I I don't know.

100
00:07:23,264 --> 00:07:24,108
Rym: Yeah, so so

101
00:07:24,148 --> 00:07:30,330
Scott: this week I think I'm gonna do a little bit of work on that thing and just make my own decisions and say ha ha and you

102
00:07:30,872 --> 00:07:38,340
Rym: Think I'm gonna set up some hamachi and then I'm just gonna start building a lamp server and writing stupid web Applications to learn we already

103
00:07:38,361 --> 00:07:39,570
Scott: have a lamp server in the other room.

104
00:07:39,884 --> 00:07:44,710
Rym: No I'm gonna make my own on this box sitting here and I'm gonna futz with it and break it in.

105
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,298
Scott: What is the one we already got?

106
00:07:46,318 --> 00:07:48,570
Rym: because I plan to break it and fix it over and over again.

107
00:07:48,731 --> 00:07:50,201
Scott: I break that one and fix it all the time.

108
00:07:50,221 --> 00:07:56,950
Rym: Yeah anyway Yeah, I'm just gonna start doing like I did at IBM whenever was bored at IBM.

109
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:00,103
Rym: I'd like build a Linux server and install Samba on it or something.

110
00:08:00,123 --> 00:08:05,590
Scott: Yeah, Ubuntu is a good Distribution to run lamp on because it the it works really nice.

111
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:09,025
Scott: Not only that but they're the configuration files are organized in an intelligent manner.

112
00:08:09,045 --> 00:08:10,070
Rym: their instructions online.

113
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,692

Rym: We don't want to talk about that.

118
00:08:18,562 --> 00:08:18,944
Scott: No, we don't.

119
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:23,662
Rym: it's game day Yeah, but before that game on now that was late.

120
00:08:24,124 --> 00:08:25,387
Rym: We're not that kind of pod.

121
00:08:25,408 --> 00:08:28,142
Rym: you got game First off.

122
00:08:28,182 --> 00:08:28,950
Rym: we're back from sitcom.

123
00:08:30,592 --> 00:08:33,404
Rym: We're gonna be talking about sitcom tomorrow though.

124
00:08:33,443 --> 00:08:36,876
Rym: Once again, I'd like to note that Entertainment system is a badass.

125
00:08:37,178 --> 00:08:40,630
Rym: video game metal band myspace comm slash entertainment system.

126
00:08:40,851 --> 00:08:50,016
Rym: We want to give them mad props because we've seen them in concert twice and they're doing a huge concert in at Penn State College, Pennsylvania October 28th.

127
00:08:50,538 --> 00:08:50,718
Scott: Yep.

128
00:08:50,999 --> 00:08:54,650
Rym: We're gonna plug it a lot because they're badasses and they deserve recognition.

129
00:08:55,202 --> 00:09:02,074
Rym: Indeed - we saw the video game pianist and hung out with him and he's an awesome, dude Even though it's really modest.

130
00:09:02,114 --> 00:09:03,418
Scott: video game penis calm.

131
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:06,107
Rym: Yeah, it sounded like you said video game penis.

132
00:09:06,207 --> 00:09:07,150
Scott: I know that's why I did.

133
00:09:07,354 --> 00:09:14,362
Rym: Yeah, yeah All I got to say is that not only is this guy awesome But he is way more modest than he needs to be dude.

134
00:09:14,382 --> 00:09:20,429
Rym: It is okay for you to say that you were cool Yeah, and he was like Looking for some ladies.

135
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,882
Scott: You know if he wasn't so modest.

136
00:09:22,922 --> 00:09:24,128
Scott: he could probably get mad.

137
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,394
Rym: ladies I could anyways.

138
00:09:25,434 --> 00:09:28,550
Rym: problem is he plays at video game cons instead of anime cons.

139
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:29,913
Scott: Yeah There was.

140
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:35,090
Scott: there was recently that thing with the with the hot girl with the violin playing the halo theme.

141
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,034
Scott: He should ask her out.

142
00:09:36,435 --> 00:09:36,817
Rym: Actually.

143
00:09:36,837 --> 00:09:41,436
Rym: We suggested to him that he should do some kind of duet Concert with her.

144
00:09:41,597 --> 00:09:43,466
Rym: Yeah, cuz that would be really freaking cool.

145
00:09:43,486 --> 00:09:44,410
Scott: That would be too awesome.

146
00:09:44,972 --> 00:09:53,570
Rym: So yeah video game pianist if you guys didn't go to sitcom you missed out on a Real up close and personal concert with this kid because it was basically this giant.

147
00:09:53,811 --> 00:10:00,829
Scott: It was a convention that was put on as if there was a thousand people there and only like less than 200 people showed up.

148
00:10:01,251 --> 00:10:03,900
Scott: So it's like there's this big con and you were all.

149
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,445
Scott: it's like being alone in the amusement park.

150
00:10:05,465 --> 00:10:05,946
Scott: Basically.

151
00:10:06,127 --> 00:10:06,990
Scott: It was fantastic.

152
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:07,673
Scott: Who's awesome?

153
00:10:07,713 --> 00:10:11,630
Rym: Sitacon was said to come could have handled like a thousand people easily.

154
00:10:11,931 --> 00:10:18,286
Scott: Yeah, I mean they did they they the staff worked as if there were a thousand people there yet there weren't.

00:10:18,627 --> 00:10:19,870
Scott: so everything was awesome.

156
00:10:20,751 --> 00:10:22,340
Scott: Yeah, we'll talk about it more tomorrow.

157
00:10:22,361 --> 00:10:23,628
Rym: Yeah, we got a lot to say about that kind.

158
00:10:23,648 --> 00:10:24,030
Rym: It was great.

159
00:10:24,151 --> 00:10:43,786
Rym: Yeah, anyway, my news is quick and non video game related because I saw this on dig and again, remember I talked about old news coming back because a dig and people who aren't hip to the internet a Lot of men when they turn 18 are noticing that they receive a Gillette Mach 3 razor or

160
00:10:43,846 --> 00:10:45,330
Scott: whatever Gillette's newest fangled.

161
00:10:45,491 --> 00:10:47,015
Rym: No, they still send out the Mach 3.

162
00:10:47,015 --> 00:10:47,658
Scott: really awesome.

163
00:10:47,698 --> 00:10:49,584
Rym: Yeah, so and one blade.

164
00:10:50,266 --> 00:10:51,470
Rym: now, we're not gonna talk about this.

165
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:54,867
Rym: We've talked about it on the show many times, but the mind is shaving episode.

166
00:10:54,907 --> 00:10:55,410
Scott: It's real old.

167
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,175
Rym: Yeah, in fact Emily's on that episode.

168
00:10:57,355 --> 00:11:01,446
Rym: Yeah, but the Gillette Mach 3 is shite shite shite shite.

169
00:11:01,506 --> 00:11:02,790
Rym: It costs more than video games.

170
00:11:04,655 --> 00:11:05,890
Scott: It costs more than video.

171
00:11:06,698 --> 00:11:10,146
Rym: God Gillette is a terrible company and their razors are terrible.

172
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:20,798
Rym: But anyway they send every man in the United States who is a citizen for the most part that they know about a razor when they turn 18 or in some places 21 usually 18.

173
00:11:20,798 --> 00:11:25,997
Rym: Mm-hmm and This has been going on since I was 18.

174
00:11:25,997 --> 00:11:27,300
Scott: I got one.

175
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:28,904
Rym: Yeah, this is 24 now.

176
00:11:28,945 --> 00:11:30,088
Rym: Well, I turned 18 before you.

177
00:11:31,211 --> 00:11:34,589
Rym: Yeah, so your be you turning 18 and get one is old news.

178
00:11:37,771 --> 00:11:41,522
Rym: Dude I'll bet our friend Colin got one probably got Johnson for I got one.

179
00:11:41,622 --> 00:11:43,829
Rym: Yeah, that old man is like a hundred.

00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:44,858
Scott: my dad Probably go.

181
00:11:45,102 --> 00:11:47,915
Scott: Yeah He's like 40 something.

182
00:11:48,015 --> 00:11:51,266
Rym: Yeah, the point is something who knows all these people are talking about like.

183
00:11:51,788 --> 00:11:52,330
Rym: this is news.

184
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,136
Rym: How is Gillette finding this information out?

185
00:11:54,176 --> 00:11:54,657
Rym: blah blah.

186
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:56,744
Rym: This is the oldest freaking news.

187
00:11:57,005 --> 00:11:58,350
Rym: This has been going on forever.

188
00:11:59,356 --> 00:12:01,430
Rym: They get the information from all sorts of places.

189
00:12:01,591 --> 00:12:06,610
Rym: It's not a big deal when they send you the razor use it once because you might as well then throw it away.

190
00:12:07,492 --> 00:12:08,113
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

191
00:12:08,734 --> 00:12:10,138
Rym: Anyway real news video games.

192
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:10,939
Scott: Okay.

193
00:12:10,979 --> 00:12:14,788
Scott: So today was the day of pre-ordering ps3s.

194
00:12:14,828 --> 00:12:17,840
Rym: Holy crap And they all went immediately.

195
00:12:18,322 --> 00:12:19,990
Scott: Yep, pretty much every GameStop.

196
00:12:20,231 --> 00:12:25,587
Scott: I think the the official GameStop corporate line is that they have 3600 stores.

197
00:12:27,233 --> 00:12:30,068
Scott: Each store had but had at least eight ps3s.

198
00:12:32,475 --> 00:12:35,531
Scott: Some of them had up to 16.

199
00:12:35,531 --> 00:12:41,750
Scott: At most two of them per store could be pre-ordered by the staff and the rest had to go to actual people.

200
00:12:41,931 --> 00:12:50,023
Rym: I point out that one of the first things I read about this was a guy from an EB talking about how Four of theirs went to the staff and another guy.

201
00:12:50,043 --> 00:12:51,490
Scott: This is the GameStop party line.

202
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,830
Scott: GameStop is one big company now.

203
00:12:54,950 --> 00:13:01,780
Scott: However, EB and GameStop are still run sort of separately kind of like YouTube and Google video But not.

204
00:13:01,902 --> 00:13:07,290
Rym: and I saw another Where the guy was like, yeah, the employees in our store got all of them and they're all on eBay.

205
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:13,917
Scott: Well, cuz what'll happen is, you know to the two of them officially if you're at a GameStop two of them Officially go to the staff.

206
00:13:14,099 --> 00:13:15,750
Scott: So those are the guys working in the store.

207
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:19,950
Scott: Alright, so if you got any other six employees are waiting outside at the front of the line.

208
00:13:20,192 --> 00:13:26,609
Rym: If you've got a store with three employees Yeah, yeah, but here's the interesting thing.

209
00:13:27,372 --> 00:13:32,690
Rym: There were like 15 pre-orders for sale on eBay like this morning.

210
00:13:33,252 --> 00:13:41,239
Scott: The thing and different stores have different policies on these pre-orders, you know Some of them say you pre-order you got one.

211
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,810
Scott: some of them say you pre-order you'll get one as soon as we can.

212
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:48,850
Scott: Some of them say you pre-order that means you have a spot in line.

213
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:54,510
Scott: So if you come here on launch day and there's a line of which there will be you have your pre-order slip.

214
00:13:54,872 --> 00:14:03,230
Scott: So you get in the front of the you, you know, you go Behind all the people who showed up before you with pre-order slips, but before the people who don't have pre-order slips.

215
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:05,979
Scott: so if the store opens at 8 a.m.

216
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,587
Scott: And you get there at 805 with your pre-order.

217
00:14:08,627 --> 00:14:12,464
Scott: slip your Sol because some guy without one is in line ahead of you.

218
00:14:12,725 --> 00:14:14,834
Rym: I got to say one thing I want to see.

219
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:25,490
Rym: I want to keep track of how many of these things go up on eBay as a Percentage of the total pre-orders because that will be one of the biggest tellings as to how popular the ps3 really is.

220
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:30,164
Scott: Yeah, the other thing is a lot of the news I've heard.

221
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:31,448
Scott: I'm not it's not a hundred percent.

222
00:14:31,508 --> 00:14:37,270
Scott: real news Is that like 80% of the ps3s are going to EB GameStops?

223
00:14:38,152 --> 00:14:42,066
Scott: And the rest of the like 20% are going to Best Buy circuit cities.

224
00:14:42,146 --> 00:14:43,270
Scott: Toys R Us is type places.

225
00:14:43,652 --> 00:14:45,744
Rym: I think the real stat here is that 90% are going to eBay.

226
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:51,766
Rym: Now to say something that I said a whole bunch of times today.

227
00:14:51,826 --> 00:14:52,730
Rym: It's been my thing today.

228
00:14:52,730 --> 00:15:05,143
Rym: I mean I get into little bits and I've been saying this over and over All right Totally got interrupted but uh by it by a ricer who just drove by and perhaps the stupidest rice car I've ever seen or heard the stupidest rice car I've ever seen.

229
00:15:05,183 --> 00:15:06,670
Rym: It's the stupidest rice car I've ever heard.

230
00:15:07,613 --> 00:15:13,237
Rym: I mean, I've never heard a rice car that sounded stupider than that and I've heard some stupid glass packs before but For what?

231
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:19,803
Rym: I was about to say before I get interrupted I would have said the exact same thing to that ricer all day today.

232
00:15:20,084 --> 00:15:22,109
Rym: I've been saying whatever dude

233
00:15:22,852 --> 00:15:23,694
Scott: Whatever dude

234
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:36,050
Rym: and that's what I got to say to the people who are gonna stand in line to get the pre-order So that they can then stand in line and possibly get a PlayStation 3 on launch for $600 plus tax plus two controllers plus a game.

235
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:39,392
Scott: Yeah, I Mean.

236
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:47,744
Rym: I'm not gonna say the ps3 is a shit system because it's a pretty powerful thing, but Getting one at launch is pretty much a losing proposition.

237
00:15:47,785 --> 00:15:54,138
Scott: No matter how you look at it Unless you're real lucky and you score big on eBay Yeah, I don't then go for it by all means.

238
00:15:54,239 --> 00:15:57,930
Scott: or if you're wicked rich like if you're loaded uncle money bags.

239
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:01,188
Rym: Yeah, if you're loaded and you're bored, there's no reason not to get a ps3.

240
00:16:01,651 --> 00:16:05,649
Scott: Yeah, it's like a great way to spend your money, but seriously buy an Xbox.

241
00:16:06,477 --> 00:16:11,770
Rym: Well think there's one Two years from now when it's a lot cheaper and the good games come out.

242
00:16:12,711 --> 00:16:13,855
Scott: This one interesting thing.

243
00:16:13,895 --> 00:16:25,831
Scott: Is that a gamestop spokesman said that while the sellout wasn't confirmed until 2 p.m They said that it was a matter of minutes at most stores, which was a faster sellout rate than the 360.

244
00:16:25,831 --> 00:16:29,926
Scott: But that might be because there are more 360s but sellout rate.

245
00:16:30,006 --> 00:16:31,010
Scott: He's not very specific.

246
00:16:31,411 --> 00:16:39,295
Rym: Yeah, well it also might be that anyone who wants a ps3 and there's probably more than two million people who want a ps3 Regardless of whether or not they can afford it.

247
00:16:40,058 --> 00:16:44,010
Rym: They probably knew that they wouldn't get one unless they acted crazily.

248
00:16:44,913 --> 00:16:48,538
Scott: Yeah, I think it's just that It for the 360.

249
00:16:48,538 --> 00:16:50,445
Scott: It's sort of just like a general gamer.

250
00:16:50,706 --> 00:16:51,870
Scott: good feelings, you know.

251
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:55,521
Scott: And for the Wii there's some craziness and also some gamer good feelings.

252
00:16:55,702 --> 00:16:56,946
Rym: Yeah, I mean the ps3.

253
00:16:57,046 --> 00:16:58,089
Scott: it's pretty much either.

254
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,135
Scott: Wow, this is stupid.

255
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:01,299
Scott: screw that shit.

256
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:06,718
Scott: if because if you're a general gamer, you're not gonna have good feelings for the ps3 So it's only crazies.

257
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:07,663
Scott: It's own.

258
00:17:07,803 --> 00:17:08,607
Scott: It's mostly ps3.

259
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:08,787
Scott: crazy.

260
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:13,025
Rym: Yeah, cuz pretty much any reasonable person because I wouldn't mind getting a ps3.

261
00:17:13,126 --> 00:17:14,109
Rym: I wouldn't mind having one.

262
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:20,214
Scott: I mean if it weren't that much money if you put one if you came up to the door and said here's a ps3 I'd be like, thank you, sir.

263
00:17:20,496 --> 00:17:34,178
Rym: And if the ps3 say it were like, you know, three or four hundred bucks I might I mean it would have been on the list of possibilities if I had money line or if I had an HDTV be higher on the list, but Goddamn got them.

264
00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:34,761
Scott: Right?

265
00:17:34,982 --> 00:17:36,410
Rym: All I want is I want it.

266
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:36,891
Rym: I'm not gonna.

267
00:17:37,011 --> 00:17:41,704
Rym: I'm gonna reserve all my judgment until the Wii pre-orders really come.

268
00:17:42,185 --> 00:17:42,967
Rym: cuz that's soon.

269
00:17:42,987 --> 00:17:47,118
Scott: I Printed out this we countdown calendar today.

270
00:17:47,138 --> 00:17:47,901
Scott: Yeah.

271
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:50,307
Rym: Well, you already have a Wii pre-order - I do.

272
00:17:50,628 --> 00:17:53,638
Rym: Yeah I mean gig nights ahead of the game.

273
00:17:53,678 --> 00:17:57,630
Rym: We got a Wii pre-order a while ago at the Nintendo World Store.

274
00:17:57,771 --> 00:17:59,015
Rym: Yeah, the most confirmed.

275
00:17:59,096 --> 00:18:01,003
Rym: we are so guaranteed to get a Wii.

276
00:18:01,064 --> 00:18:02,168
Rym: It's pretty much like me.

277
00:18:02,328 --> 00:18:08,030
Scott: Oh, no Not only am I getting a Wii there's a good chance like Reggie will personally hand me my Wii.

278
00:18:08,211 --> 00:18:11,930
Rym: Yeah, I mean, I can you imagine what it's gonna go down at the Nintendo store?

279
00:18:12,231 --> 00:18:15,760
Scott: It's gonna be some craziness full reports from GeekNights in 40 days.

280
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,685
Rym: Yeah, 40 days a day 40 days and 40 nights.

281
00:18:17,705 --> 00:18:26,170
Rym: Yep But I really can't wait until the Wii pre-orders come out and then the actual launch days.

282
00:18:26,732 --> 00:18:35,126
Rym: Cuz I'll bet that the ps3 and the Wii will both sell out Maybe and that means a very different thing to Sony as it does to Nintendo.

283
00:18:35,788 --> 00:18:37,979
Scott: It doesn't be All right.

284
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:48,729
Rym: Anyway things of the day dinner dinner.

285
00:18:48,971 --> 00:18:57,190
Rym: You think I should sit down with a bunch of effects and make a radio kind of you know Things of the day with a lot of reverb and echo and lasers in the background and shit.

286
00:18:57,332 --> 00:18:58,190
Scott: We should do that eventually.

287
00:18:58,830 --> 00:18:59,676
Rym: What do you guys think?

288
00:18:59,696 --> 00:19:00,702
Rym: is that a good idea or not?

289
00:19:00,984 --> 00:19:02,010
Scott: I think it's an awesome idea.

290
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:05,748
Scott: It's much better than hearing you say things of the day than hearing me go doo doo doo doo doo doo.

291
00:19:05,969 --> 00:19:08,018
Rym: Yep We have this dynamic here.

292
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:08,440
Rym: Yeah.

293
00:19:08,782 --> 00:19:10,449
Rym: All right thing of the day here.

294
00:19:10,991 --> 00:19:17,797
Rym: so I was playing bionic commando as I've been talking about and I was real good at that game as a kid and I got better at it.

295
00:19:18,563 --> 00:19:23,280
Rym: and on the way to CityCon I beat it and killed Hitler twice in the car.

296
00:19:23,641 --> 00:19:24,744
Scott: You can't kill two Hitler.

297
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:25,987
Rym: We can't kill two Hitler's.

298
00:19:26,007 --> 00:19:30,504
Rym: I then killed Hitler like four more times at the con.

299
00:19:30,525 --> 00:19:31,408
Scott: kill six Hitler's.

300
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:41,024
Rym: and Not only did I find a couple speed runs of bionic commando But I learned a way to beat the game a lot quicker that I didn't realize.

301
00:19:41,064 --> 00:19:43,010
Scott: you can't beat bionic commando ten minutes.

302
00:19:43,796 --> 00:19:45,510
Rym: So I'm linking to two speed runs.

303
00:19:46,011 --> 00:20:00,509
Rym: The first speedrun is not machine assisted is a straight-up guy playing the game all the way through American version speedrun and It is pretty much a video of almost exactly how I play bionic commando.

304
00:20:01,092 --> 00:20:06,410
Rym: I mean I was following along watching it with my fingers and it's pretty much straight up how I play the game.

305
00:20:06,631 --> 00:20:12,549
Rym: Except there's a couple of places where he did things I didn't think to do and there's a couple of places where he fucks up and I could have done it better.

306
00:20:13,971 --> 00:20:16,829
Scott: That's pretty typical yeah, but I mean what about the other speed run?

307
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:22,429
Rym: you go All right, the other speed runs of the Japanese version of the game, which is easier and harder.

308
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:26,181
Rym: Oh, yeah gonna be easier and hard in one level like I see him going.

309
00:20:26,201 --> 00:20:27,928
Rym: and there's these platforms that weren't there before.

310
00:20:27,948 --> 00:20:29,937
Rym: they make it a Fuck shit ton easy.

311
00:20:29,957 --> 00:20:31,526
Scott: Are you sure there aren't platforms of death?

312
00:20:31,606 --> 00:20:32,209
Rym: Yes, I'm sure.

313
00:20:33,073 --> 00:20:42,590
Rym: But yet then there's this like wall of spikes that comes out of nowhere and all these extra guys And there's changes to the game that I don't even know why they bothered because they like they took stuff out of the game.

314
00:20:42,751 --> 00:20:43,982
Rym: There's nothing to do with anything.

315
00:20:44,366 --> 00:20:48,699
Rym: No It's weird, but all right, that's a fucking speedrun.

316
00:20:48,860 --> 00:21:01,310
Rym: I can't play the game like the second speedrun, but I'm gonna try Okay, because I think I'll be able to do that someday Mmm, so my thing of the day is yet another funny video from College Humor.

317
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:01,651
Scott: You like.

318
00:21:01,752 --> 00:21:02,696
Rym: this is fucking a Larry.

319
00:21:02,736 --> 00:21:05,187
Scott: College Humor is coming out with the funny videos lately.

320
00:21:05,227 --> 00:21:05,830
Scott: way to go guys.

321
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:07,437
Rym: Yeah, I mean there that Street Fighter 2 thing.

322
00:21:07,457 --> 00:21:12,216
Scott: We just talked about and yeah, so now they've got this Rejected Wii games.

323
00:21:12,477 --> 00:21:14,343
Scott: it says the upcoming Nintendo Wii.

324
00:21:14,624 --> 00:21:29,900
Scott: we use a revolutionary new controller which won't be used for any of the following and it's basically a video of a bunch of people with a normal remote control that they're pretending as a Wii controller and They're acting as if they're playing Wii games that don't exist.

325
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,450
Scott: Like the first guy is flipping burgers at McDonald's.

326
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:35,176
Rym: It's called five dollars an hour.

327
00:21:35,196 --> 00:21:36,521
Scott: Yeah, and he's.

328
00:21:36,562 --> 00:21:38,368
Scott: he acts like he's working at McDonald's.

329
00:21:38,649 --> 00:21:43,399
Rym: now The video is hilarious Spoilers cuz whatever but my favorite one.

330
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,084
Rym: it's called hot hands.

331
00:21:45,264 --> 00:21:46,247
Rym: No hot hands is good.

332
00:21:46,267 --> 00:21:47,170
Rym: You remember hot hands?

333
00:21:47,771 --> 00:21:49,530
Rym: It's hard to describe as the slap.

334
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:54,050
Scott: It's the game where you try to slap the other guys hands the game that no one ever really played so much.

335
00:21:54,171 --> 00:21:55,961
Rym: It was just kind of like in movies.

336
00:21:56,001 --> 00:21:56,685
Rym: It was there a lot.

337
00:21:56,765 --> 00:21:57,510
Scott: Oh, I play that game.

338
00:21:57,891 --> 00:22:00,439
Rym: It's always just like a big kid picking on a little something.

339
00:22:00,459 --> 00:22:01,161
Scott: gotta make mercy.

340
00:22:01,201 --> 00:22:02,104
Rym: We mercy.

341
00:22:02,164 --> 00:22:04,090
Scott: we gotta make mercy for the way.

342
00:22:04,351 --> 00:22:08,410
Rym: Why don't they make like schoolyard games for the Wii and have a million stupid games like that?

343
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:09,875
Scott: It'll be a backyard baseball.

344
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,139
Scott: I'm sure will eventually come out.

345
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,944
Scott: Yes a popular one.

346
00:22:13,025 --> 00:22:14,509
Rym: It's like Nazi something.

347
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:25,739
Rym: So it's just like you hear all this Hitler stuff like Hitler giving a speech and then when the crowd goes they Kyle the kid Holds the Wii controller like zig heil zig heil And then it's like thing.

348
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,222
Scott: Perfect.

349
00:22:26,383 --> 00:22:30,800
Scott: Yeah, the other one is The one the guy does hara-kiri with the.

350
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,288
Rym: yeah, it's like seppuku and that would be a cool game.

351
00:22:33,328 --> 00:22:37,670
Scott: kind of Make sure you kill yourself properly with this Wii controller.

352
00:22:37,911 --> 00:22:41,545
Rym: I have anything I would make a samurai game where there is a seppuku minigame.

353
00:22:41,726 --> 00:22:50,794
Rym: Haha, or maybe Or if you just lose you got to commit seppuku and you can get a but like you get a bunch of points for committing Seppuku properly.

354
00:22:51,095 --> 00:22:55,070
Scott: so at the end of the game should have a game where you yuck as a boss and you chop fingers off.

355
00:22:55,272 --> 00:22:56,149
Rym: Let that finger fly.

356
00:22:57,531 --> 00:23:02,050
Rym: But imagine this you're playing this yacht this like samurai game and you can just get killed.

357
00:23:02,371 --> 00:23:08,895
Rym: But the best way to win is get as far as you can and then instead of dying you commit seppuku Before someone kills you.

358
00:23:08,916 --> 00:23:12,269
Rym: but you got to do it right and you get a crazy bonus if you do it properly.

359
00:23:13,431 --> 00:23:16,127
Scott: Should we let people in on the let that finger fly joke?

360
00:23:16,489 --> 00:23:20,529
Rym: All right I don't remember how to say it in Japanese, but I learned it once because I thought it was really funny.

361
00:23:21,172 --> 00:23:33,030
Rym: but apparently and this is an all old Yakuza manga and Gekiga and Yakuza anime if You piss off the Yakuza Lord, you know a lot of movies They show like Yakuza guys have fingers missing.

362
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:37,550
Rym: Yeah, now a lot of people thought that that was just like Oh Yakuza guys have a finger missing.

363
00:23:38,172 --> 00:23:42,450
Rym: No, if your finger got cut off that means that you did something stupid and they punished you.

364
00:23:43,391 --> 00:23:45,541
Scott: Usually, you know in Yakuza movies.

365
00:23:45,602 --> 00:23:52,955
Scott: It'll be you did something stupid and You would cut off your finger and then offer it to the Yakuza boss like I'm sorry finger.

366
00:23:53,136 --> 00:24:05,561
Rym: or sometimes the Yakuza boss turns to you and basically says let that finger fly which means Goddamnit, yep, so he'd either order you to cut it off or apparently nowadays They'll just say it and it's it.

367
00:24:05,601 --> 00:24:07,410
Rym: they don't actually want you to cut your finger off.

368
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:09,084
Rym: It's more of a wow, you did something stupid.

369
00:24:09,286 --> 00:24:14,370
Scott: Yeah So if you're a Yakuza and you screw up someone to be like let that finger fly now.

370
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:21,568
Rym: I might be totally wrong here But from what we've gathered it seems that the origin of the Yakuza finger thing comes from way back feudal Japan.

371
00:24:21,989 --> 00:24:22,230
Rym: where?

372
00:24:23,431 --> 00:24:29,209
Rym: For various reasons a swordsman's pinky finger would be cut off thus making him a much less effective swordsman.

373
00:24:30,211 --> 00:24:35,050
Rym: I'm sure our friend Katsu can tell us whether or not the pinky finger is critical to wielding a sword.

374
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:37,064
Scott: I'm think it would be don't you?

375
00:24:37,084 --> 00:24:37,909
Rym: I think so.

376
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:44,819
Rym: Well, that's why I want to ask Katsu cuz I mean he kicked that guy's ass at Otakon Yeah, and he's really good at Kendo.

377
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:46,225
Rym: So I'm sure he knows anyway.

378
00:24:46,305 --> 00:24:47,330
Scott: funny Wii game video.

379
00:24:48,311 --> 00:24:49,269
Scott: It's really funny.

380
00:24:50,511 --> 00:24:56,390
Scott: You want to watch this, you know and from the in the future just go to College Humor and watch their videos cuz they're funny.

381
00:24:56,551 --> 00:24:59,642
Rym: Yeah, we're not gonna use those as things today anymore unless they're crazy.

382
00:24:59,662 --> 00:25:04,399
Scott: Yeah, we'll stick with the ever popular You goog or goog tube.

383
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,372
Rym: I like goo - goo - goo - goo - All right.

384
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:11,522
Rym: So today well actually two days ago.

385
00:25:11,542 --> 00:25:16,929
Rym: We were talking about what to do the show on and we decided let's just pick any old game and do it like some old game we both play.

386
00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:25,490
Rym: and Then today on a whim I whipped out the Atari 7800 and my giant shoebox full of games and the four new games you just bought.

387
00:25:25,771 --> 00:25:31,131
Rym: Yeah, we bought a bunch of games for the Atari original cartridges recently at a video game store Uh-huh.

388
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:36,366
Rym: So we bought a ice hockey because I didn't own it warlord because my copy didn't.

389
00:25:36,466 --> 00:25:41,330
Rym: my copy didn't work anymore Yars revenge because I never actually played it and God that game is stupid.

390
00:25:43,562 --> 00:25:45,786
Rym: Anyway These games and we started playing it.

391
00:25:46,772 --> 00:25:53,358
Scott: I thought we'd review a whole bunch of Atari games because and describe some of them and how they work because a lot of people Don't understand a lot of.

392
00:25:53,398 --> 00:26:00,890
Rym: I mean in a lot of ways Video gaming hasn't come that far And in other ways it's come a million million miles.

393
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:15,858
Rym: Yeah But like compare there are Atari games that are better like hands-down Objectively better games than a lot of the Super Nintendo games that came out the like mountain bike whatever it's like whatever god I'd rather play the yards revenge daily.

394
00:26:15,878 --> 00:26:18,449
Rym: Yeah, I know ever have to play that fucker again.

395
00:26:19,712 --> 00:26:24,276
Rym: The other thing I'd like to point out is that Scott's going to make a whole bunch of stink about this But god damn it does.

396
00:26:24,317 --> 00:26:26,026
Rym: he suck at Atari you suck.

397
00:26:26,066 --> 00:26:26,709
Scott: What are you telling me?

398
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,039
Rym: All right Do we have to list all?

399
00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:38,173
Scott: because I'm using the Atari 7800 has the shit joysticks that no other game system has had the like of ever and They're really.

400
00:26:38,394 --> 00:26:43,152
Scott: the only reason that you can use those things is because you use them when you were a kid and you've been using them For years.

401
00:26:43,514 --> 00:26:47,130
Scott: nobody else who's never used them before can manage them.

402
00:26:47,592 --> 00:26:51,270
Scott: I'm gonna go get a Sega Genesis controller and then you'll see that I don't suck at these games.

403
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,602
Scott: I just suck with the shitty 7800 controllers.

404
00:26:53,763 --> 00:26:55,255
Rym: Yeah We'll see cuz you were it.

405
00:26:55,355 --> 00:27:01,135
Rym: I mean you were making tactical mistakes in a lot of these games not just what ever Like the maze game.

406
00:27:01,175 --> 00:27:02,741
Rym: You just don't know what your way around mazes.

407
00:27:02,861 --> 00:27:04,547
Scott: Oh, well screw that stupid maze game.

408
00:27:04,567 --> 00:27:06,856
Rym: All right It's a sign of intelligence.

409
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:08,021
Rym: You just can't follow a man.

410
00:27:08,101 --> 00:27:13,761
Scott: I could I just kept going on the wrong way because I could have followed the maze.

411
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:19,030
Scott: I just kept going though cuz the stupid joystick I would make a right turn and the guy would keep going straight into the dead end.

412
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:22,063
Scott: I had to turn around then he go too far and I had to turn around again.

413
00:27:22,083 --> 00:27:23,610
Rym: You have no manual dexterity.

414
00:27:23,712 --> 00:27:29,117
Scott: I have plenty of manual dexterity Just is mostly in my thumbs and not for a shit Joystick that I mean.

415
00:27:29,418 --> 00:27:30,483
Scott: I could use a joystick.

416
00:27:30,503 --> 00:27:37,327
Scott: if you give me a Street Fighter 2 joystick I'm all good, but you keep saying that the Atari 2600s joystick is superior.

417
00:27:37,368 --> 00:27:38,512
Scott: It is superior I don't.

418
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:38,834
Rym: I think.

419
00:27:38,874 --> 00:27:42,009
Rym: if you use it again, you'll realize that they're pretty much the same.

420
00:27:42,511 --> 00:27:44,098
Scott: No, I don't think so.

421
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,544
Scott: It's a. it's not purpose.

422
00:27:45,564 --> 00:27:46,227
Scott: Regardless.

423
00:27:46,348 --> 00:27:49,109
Scott: It doesn't matter I'm getting a Genesis controller next time I go to my house.

424
00:27:49,531 --> 00:27:51,700
Rym: So the first game we played was a game I hadn't played.

425
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,230
Scott: cuz if you didn't know you can use a Genesis controller on an Atari.

426
00:27:54,531 --> 00:27:55,897
Rym: Yes, they're the same connector and everything.

427
00:27:55,937 --> 00:27:57,583
Rym: Yep, even though most the buttons don't work.

428
00:27:58,386 --> 00:27:59,149
Scott: I only need one button.

429
00:28:00,033 --> 00:28:02,001
Rym: Uh at 7800 games you need two buttons.

430
00:28:02,262 --> 00:28:03,708
Scott: a Genesis controller has three buttons.

431
00:28:04,029 --> 00:28:07,709
Rym: Yeah Yeah, you'll have to figure out which button is what a and B. All right.

432
00:28:08,454 --> 00:28:13,559
Rym: So we're gonna review a whole bunch of Atari 2600 and 7800 games starting with.

433
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,723
Rym: we'll go pretty much in the order.

434
00:28:14,743 --> 00:28:15,265
Rym: We played them.

435
00:28:15,967 --> 00:28:19,002
Scott: ice hockey You know, it wasn't so bad.

436
00:28:19,042 --> 00:28:20,410
Scott: It was from Activision by the way.

437
00:28:20,611 --> 00:28:27,518
Rym: Yeah, this game is not as good as the Nintendo version of ice hockey Which I consider to be the best hockey game ever made.

438
00:28:27,638 --> 00:28:30,890
Rym: I agree, but it was actually pretty good.

439
00:28:31,311 --> 00:28:35,830
Scott: Yeah, you think you figure an ice hockey game for the Atari be kind of crummy, but it really isn't so bad.

440
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:39,390
Scott: The only thing that's really bad about it is that you have two guys on the ice.

441
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:46,890
Scott: you know one guy is sort of at the top and one guy sort of at the bottom and Moving the stick moves the guy who is closest to the puck.

442
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:53,870
Scott: So if the puck is up at the top of the ice then the guy on the top you can move and the guy In the bottom, you can't control it all.

443
00:28:54,352 --> 00:29:01,990
Scott: So, you know, I kept wanting to move the guy at the bottom of the ice closer to the goal But I couldn't because I could only move the guy at the top and that was annoying.

444
00:29:02,832 --> 00:29:04,930
Scott: But other than that the ice hockey game was pretty good.

445
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:07,739
Scott: You know your guy gets the puck you skate around you shoot.

446
00:29:08,161 --> 00:29:08,642
Scott: it's pretty much.

447
00:29:08,682 --> 00:29:13,029
Scott: all you can do is shoot with in a direction Yeah, or you can knock the other guy down.

448
00:29:13,231 --> 00:29:13,794
Scott: Yeah, you can.

449
00:29:13,834 --> 00:29:16,790
Scott: you can push the button a whole lot to mess with the other guy when you're on defense.

450
00:29:17,312 --> 00:29:18,436
Rym: Yep, Scott ended up beating me.

451
00:29:18,476 --> 00:29:19,379
Rym: I think ten to six.

452
00:29:19,821 --> 00:29:20,303
Rym: Whoo.

453
00:29:20,363 --> 00:29:22,130
Rym: It was a pretty stunning victory on Scott's.

454
00:29:22,271 --> 00:29:22,836
Scott: I'm good at them.

455
00:29:22,937 --> 00:29:23,624
Scott: ice hockey games.

456
00:29:23,644 --> 00:29:30,605
Rym: Let me tell you Yeah Even though I beat you the last time we played NES ice hockey and this is with the shitty 7800 controller I could still play ice hockey because there wasn't much to this game.

457
00:29:30,645 --> 00:29:31,390
Rym: It moved real slow.

458
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:33,598
Rym: We were playing on the fast advanced setting.

459
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,766
Scott: Yeah, it was still pretty fun.

460
00:29:35,786 --> 00:29:36,690
Scott: Like I would play it some more.

461
00:29:36,971 --> 00:29:50,536
Rym: Yeah, well the other thing is ice hockey is one of the earlier Atari games because the Atari like every other system Progress quite a bit as it went on and older games were not as good as games that came out late in the Atari's Lifecycle were much more.

462
00:29:50,897 --> 00:29:59,045
Scott: It's like Mario 3 compared to Mario 1 Yeah, or like urban champions urban champions compared to Zelda 2.

463
00:29:59,045 --> 00:30:01,332
Rym: Yeah star tropics Exactly.

464
00:30:01,352 --> 00:30:08,601
Rym: All right, so then we played warlords, which is pretty much the iconic Multiplayer Atari game.

465
00:30:09,144 --> 00:30:09,264
Scott: It's.

466
00:30:09,365 --> 00:30:10,290
Scott: it's a great game.

467
00:30:10,813 --> 00:30:19,262
Scott: I think it's unique for the Atari and that is a fast-paced smooth paddle controlled Four-player directly versus game.

468
00:30:19,523 --> 00:30:21,050
Rym: Yeah straight up four player.

469
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:33,163
Rym: it's basically four player breakout where each person in the corner has a castle and Knights that moves around the outside and a dragon breathes a fireball and the fire.

470
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:40,485
Scott: the Knights bounce the fireball against each other and Hit each other's castles and then if the fireball gets into your castle you die.

471
00:30:40,987 --> 00:30:41,870
Rym: we played two-player.

472
00:30:42,192 --> 00:30:43,420
Rym: I beat Scott the first time.

473
00:30:43,662 --> 00:30:44,850
Rym: he beat me the second time.

474
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:48,202
Scott: I'm actually good at warlords and I can use any paddle games I can.

475
00:30:48,283 --> 00:30:49,065
Scott: I can do so.

476
00:30:49,106 --> 00:31:00,610
Rym: then we tried to play with Alex And we learned that my Atari which is old as fucker Can't the second port can't support the multiplayer paddles anymore so we can only play two-player games.

477
00:31:00,871 --> 00:31:03,160
Scott: Or maybe we need to flick some switches or who knows what.

478
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,727
Scott: but yeah, it just didn't work.

479
00:31:04,928 --> 00:31:05,510
Scott: it was unhappy.

480
00:31:05,651 --> 00:31:06,618
Rym: Yeah game has issues.

481
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,390
Rym: Mmm warlord is a good game.

482
00:31:08,551 --> 00:31:16,130
Rym: I mean it has issues just for the fact that it's an old Atari game But that is one of the earliest four-player games.

483
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:17,697
Rym: That wasn't just as.

484
00:31:17,978 --> 00:31:28,170
Scott: if you want to play a new good version of warlords I don't want to recommend this game, but the retro Atari compilation for the DS It's not really that great.

485
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:32,521
Scott: It's more like some guy Practice DS coding by making implementing a bunch of it.

486
00:31:32,681 --> 00:31:35,150
Rym: don't buy it unless you see it for five bucks or less.

487
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:37,711
Scott: Yeah, I spent like 15 no a 10 on it I think.

488
00:31:37,791 --> 00:31:44,950
Scott: but yeah, it has warlords so you can try warlords out with that and it's an okay version of warlords.

489
00:31:45,813 --> 00:31:48,161
Rym: So then we played slot racer, which is a game.

490
00:31:48,221 --> 00:31:50,690
Rym: I used to love as a kid even though it's real hard.

491
00:31:51,052 --> 00:31:53,689
Scott: It's real hard and complicated and obtuse.

492
00:31:54,211 --> 00:32:04,329
Rym: yeah, once you figure out what's going on see slot racers the game where you have these vehicles that move around and The controls are intuitive, but they're not obvious.

493
00:32:05,172 --> 00:32:13,255
Rym: like once you figure it out you're like, oh and then you have a lot of control over the game and it's really just a Game of being able to.

494
00:32:13,316 --> 00:32:14,740
Rym: I mean Atari games are simple.

495
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,523
Rym: They're blocks.

496
00:32:15,964 --> 00:32:17,730
Rym: It's usually blocks moving around.

497
00:32:18,272 --> 00:32:19,639
Rym: The controls are real.

498
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,790
Rym: simply got one button in an eight-way joystick.

499
00:32:22,772 --> 00:32:26,649
Rym: So the skills involved tend to come down to straight up.

500
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:32,510
Rym: I hand coordination pattern recognition movement prediction better joysticks.

501
00:32:33,132 --> 00:32:43,430
Rym: so in terms of this game the game is basically trying to predict where the other person will go and Creating a path for your projectile that will hit him while avoiding his projectile.

502
00:32:44,311 --> 00:32:45,796
Rym: And you like basically you program.

503
00:32:46,278 --> 00:32:47,181
Rym: it sounds like a lot.

504
00:32:47,221 --> 00:32:50,412
Rym: it's a lot of guitar games were really complex even though you had such Simple controls.

505
00:32:50,994 --> 00:32:53,463
Rym: you're driving around controlling your vehicle simultaneously.

506
00:32:53,483 --> 00:33:01,570
Rym: You shoot projectiles and Effectively program them with simple logic to move around and you try to get them to hit the opponent.

507
00:33:02,951 --> 00:33:04,537
Rym: Scott couldn't play the game at all.

508
00:33:04,557 --> 00:33:07,990
Rym: I beat him handily a bunch of times, but I never played the game.

509
00:33:08,792 --> 00:33:13,443
Rym: I can't blame you because the game is real difficult to be good at it's really.

510
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:16,310
Scott: I couldn't see many people liking this game.

511
00:33:16,531 --> 00:33:21,010
Rym: I love that game me my brother and my dad and all my friends played it constantly and I'm real good at it.

512
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:21,827
Rym: And so we're all of them.

513
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:25,970
Scott: I think if you tried to make a game like that today people would be like fuck this shit and throw it out.

514
00:33:26,751 --> 00:33:29,570
Rym: Yeah, you kids have no patience for actual difficult game.

515
00:33:29,711 --> 00:33:31,943
Scott: It's not worth it because it's not that fun.

516
00:33:32,023 --> 00:33:37,930
Rym: even once they're good at it Alright, so then we played maze craze, which is actually one of my favorite Atari games.

517
00:33:38,312 --> 00:33:42,130
Rym: It has a lot of different kinds of levels and basically you got a blue guy and a red guy.

518
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:57,075
Rym: it's two player always and a maze and whoever gets the end of the maze first wins and Scott couldn't deal with the fact that it would be like one two three go with the maze appears and I immediately am running directly For the exit as fast as possible.

519
00:33:57,778 --> 00:34:00,867
Scott: I think you've memorized all the mazes, but they're actually random Scott.

520
00:34:01,128 --> 00:34:03,073
Scott: Yeah, whatever Whatever.

521
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:09,570
Scott: no, they really my main problem is that like, you know I would start off pick a direction and go for it and then I would look to see if I was going the right way.

522
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:11,629
Rym: That's what I did, but you always went the wrong way.

523
00:34:11,971 --> 00:34:18,062
Scott: Well, and then the other problem was that I would you know I'd be like turn left and my guy would go straight a little bit too far.

524
00:34:18,081 --> 00:34:19,347
Scott: then I have to turn around.

525
00:34:19,367 --> 00:34:21,536
Scott: I go too far You know, it was really hard to.

526
00:34:22,521 --> 00:34:24,469
Scott: I don't know why you have so much ice with the joys.

527
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:26,201
Rym: I don't know why you have so much trouble with this joystick.

528
00:34:26,261 --> 00:34:27,650
Rym: I find it to be incredibly precise.

529
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:30,761
Rym: The thing is it's not a joystick and don't treat it as such.

530
00:34:31,081 --> 00:34:33,409
Rym: treat it as a d-pad with a stick coming out of it.

531
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,695
Scott: That's no good cuz.

532
00:34:34,815 --> 00:34:36,241
Rym: I don't move it like a joystick.

533
00:34:36,322 --> 00:34:38,170
Rym: I tap it left and right it up and down.

534
00:34:38,652 --> 00:34:39,315
Scott: I can't do that.

535
00:34:39,397 --> 00:34:40,664
Scott: I got a if it's a joystick.

536
00:34:40,684 --> 00:34:41,630
Scott: I gotta hold it in one.

537
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:43,453
Rym: I gotta hold it now I got maze.

538
00:34:43,493 --> 00:34:46,608
Rym: craze is a game that it was probably my favorite favorite favorite game.

539
00:34:46,648 --> 00:34:48,676
Rym: as a kid I played it constantly with my brother.

540
00:34:48,696 --> 00:34:52,510
Rym: It was like a battle of wits because it's not just a maze.

541
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:54,362
Rym: I mean you can play where part of the maze is invisible.

542
00:34:54,463 --> 00:34:55,530
Rym: all of the maze is invisible.

543
00:34:56,072 --> 00:35:10,630
Rym: You can play one version where while you're running you can hit the button and Create a secret door where it looks like there's no path, but there is a path that confuse the other person Mm-hmm, and there are some modes where you have to collect three things that are moving around and then escape.

544
00:35:11,072 --> 00:35:15,130
Rym: There are modes where there are things moving around that kill you so you have to get out without being killed.

545
00:35:16,252 --> 00:35:19,729
Rym: The game is really really good and really really taxing on the brain.

546
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:23,350
Rym: Yeah, Scott's brain was a little overtaxed.

547
00:35:24,672 --> 00:35:25,316
Scott: No, not really.

548
00:35:25,558 --> 00:35:26,785
Rym: I beat him like ten times.

549
00:35:26,825 --> 00:35:27,570
Rym: then he just turned the game.

550
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:29,237
Scott: I wasn't my brain that was over.

551
00:35:29,257 --> 00:35:30,322
Scott: text is my hand.

552
00:35:30,643 --> 00:35:38,987
Rym: Yeah, your manual dexterity though There were a couple times you just went the wrong way and then like because you were going fine And you you had this like you thought you're gonna win and then you stopped.

553
00:35:39,047 --> 00:35:42,483
Rym: you said Shit, you were in a dead end all by yourself.

554
00:35:42,725 --> 00:35:44,976
Scott: Yeah No good.

555
00:35:45,399 --> 00:35:45,983
Rym: It's a good game.

556
00:35:46,003 --> 00:35:46,729
Rym: I like it a lot.

557
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:48,313
Scott: Yeah It would do.

558
00:35:48,574 --> 00:35:50,080
Scott: I would do better at it if it like.

559
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:55,829
Scott: they showed you the maze and then they counted down from five And then you went instead of you go as soon as the maze appears.

560
00:35:56,731 --> 00:35:58,055
Rym: Yeah, well, it's a different kind of game.

561
00:35:58,316 --> 00:36:02,250
Rym: Yeah, it's more of a quick reactions game than a.

562
00:36:02,591 --> 00:36:06,367
Scott: I just want to look at the maze for even one second before I have to start moving.

563
00:36:06,588 --> 00:36:07,090
Rym: see well the game.

564
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:07,794
Rym: Well, here's the thing.

565
00:36:07,834 --> 00:36:12,056
Rym: if you wait and look then if I go the wrong way Automatically then you win.

566
00:36:12,277 --> 00:36:14,892
Scott: as long as then if you went the right way, I'm screwed I have.

567
00:36:15,093 --> 00:36:19,142
Scott: the only way to do it is to do it the way you do it Where you go the right way right?

568
00:36:19,162 --> 00:36:19,466
Scott: Okay.

569
00:36:19,506 --> 00:36:25,446
Rym: Well, yeah Well, the game is the game of how quickly can you parse a very simple maze?

570
00:36:25,626 --> 00:36:26,569
Rym: Well, it's not that simple.

571
00:36:26,669 --> 00:36:27,956
Scott: actually They're pretty complex.

572
00:36:27,997 --> 00:36:29,970
Scott: You can even make them even more complex in the higher levels.

573
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:36,689
Rym: yeah, the one trick is that it's like all mazes there tends to be a Direction you want to go in and you can kind of get a feel for it.

574
00:36:37,373 --> 00:36:40,930
Rym: But it's definitely a game of how quickly can you parse a pattern and then implement it?

575
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:49,880
Scott: The thing is like I don't even try to parse the maze because I have to start moving right away Arse and move at the same time and

576
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:57,669
Rym: I'll often go the wrong way when Scott's real close to me on Purpose and then immediately duck out because he'll follow me and then run off into the dead end

577
00:36:58,532 --> 00:37:00,320
Scott: It's because I can't control my guy.

578
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,610
Rym: Hey, yeah, it's also just it's a good game.

579
00:37:02,931 --> 00:37:08,470
Rym: Yeah, anyway, then we played some 7800 games, which is the next iteration of the Atari.

580
00:37:08,652 --> 00:37:10,330
Rym: Yeah, the 800 was backward compatible.

581
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:19,430
Scott: Yeah, you got the Atari 7800 is a system that can play Atari 2600 games But it can also play Atari 7800 games, which are almost as good as a Nintendo game.

582
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:32,201
Rym: In fact Atari's well, they're almost as good as low-end Atari 7800 games have the capability to be on par almost straight up with non MMC meaning early NES games.

583
00:37:32,341 --> 00:37:39,322
Scott: Yeah Donkey Kong for the Atari 7800 is Basically 90% identical to Donkey Kong for the NES.

584
00:37:39,623 --> 00:37:41,730
Rym: Yep, and we played Donkey Kong.

585
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:44,704
Scott: Don't care for the NES is still better, but I kicked Scott's ass.

586
00:37:45,167 --> 00:37:48,004
Scott: Well, I Frickin I don't know what the hell was going on there.

587
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:58,610
Scott: But like I'm usually the master of Donkey Kong Well, not the grand master But I can usually beat like a few I can get Donkey Kong dead a few times before it's game over.

588
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:02,247
Rym: Right now I'd give you the controller thing because you have trouble with the controller.

589
00:38:02,287 --> 00:38:02,890
Rym: I respect that.

590
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:07,630
Rym: It's not that big a deal, but you made serious tactical errors.

591
00:38:07,791 --> 00:38:12,055
Scott: It's like you played level one and I watched you and I was like, yep That's exactly what I do.

592
00:38:12,115 --> 00:38:14,747
Scott: and I was watching it and that was how my brain processed.

593
00:38:14,767 --> 00:38:15,370
Scott: level of Donkey.

594
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:21,007
Scott: Yeah, but then you and then I did it and like these are these barrels coming at me from other places I'm like, what the fuck?

595
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:23,057
Rym: Well, the thing is like you went up ladders.

596
00:38:23,117 --> 00:38:25,749
Rym: that is dangerous to go up and then the barrel would come down and get you.

597
00:38:26,051 --> 00:38:27,156
Scott: Yeah, I don't know what was going on.

598
00:38:27,197 --> 00:38:27,941
Scott: There was no good.

599
00:38:28,684 --> 00:38:28,905
Rym: Yes.

600
00:38:28,966 --> 00:38:33,030
Rym: I played through it for a while But I didn't make it past the second level because I did the Rama Sharma.

601
00:38:33,231 --> 00:38:35,590
Rym: I tried to do too much with you tried to do too much.

602
00:38:35,831 --> 00:38:37,897
Rym: I tried to get that stupid purse and that was the enemy.

603
00:38:37,957 --> 00:38:43,656
Scott: never go for the stupid person level in - - It's always stupid to go for that.

604
00:38:43,977 --> 00:38:45,907
Scott: You just go kill Donkey Kong get your points.

605
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:51,666
Scott: So then we played Donkey Kong jr Which is a game that I played in the arcade maybe two times ever.

606
00:38:51,686 --> 00:38:55,037
Scott: Yeah All I remember is the one where Donkey Kong jr.

607
00:38:55,097 --> 00:38:59,288
Scott: Tries to save Donkey Kong from Mario and he goes on vines.

608
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,677
Rym: Yep, it's actually a really good game.

609
00:39:01,737 --> 00:39:03,725
Rym: I mean, it's I'd say it's on par with Donkey Kong.

610
00:39:04,006 --> 00:39:05,774
Rym: No, not really I think it is.

611
00:39:06,096 --> 00:39:07,382
Scott: No, it's been dying.

612
00:39:07,402 --> 00:39:12,830
Rym: Kong 3 God Yeah, but this I kick Scott.

613
00:39:13,133 --> 00:39:19,586
Rym: I'm not gonna keep hammering this but Scott was like he watched me play and I like bust through the game like crazy and I can't.

614
00:39:19,646 --> 00:39:29,237
Rym: I save doggy on a bunch Of time I finally die and I even did crazy stunts Like I jumped on things you can't jump on to and glitch the game to get even further Mmm, and then Scott starts.

615
00:39:29,258 --> 00:39:36,270
Rym: he dies like immediately like he climbs up the first vine And then he falls to his death and then he climbs up the first line to the exact same spot.

616
00:39:36,672 --> 00:39:38,721
Rym: It falls to his death in the exact same way.

617
00:39:38,741 --> 00:39:40,349
Scott: It's it wasn't fun.

618
00:39:41,351 --> 00:39:41,873
Rym: No, it was.

619
00:39:41,913 --> 00:39:42,677
Scott: it's not a good game.

620
00:39:42,878 --> 00:39:43,721
Scott: It's a pretty good game.

621
00:39:43,782 --> 00:39:45,590
Rym: No, it's not gonna cuz you're not good at it.

622
00:39:45,751 --> 00:39:47,350
Scott: No, it's really just not a good game.

623
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:50,389
Rym: Well when I was a kid, actually I sucked ass at that game and I hated it.

624
00:39:51,152 --> 00:39:52,880
Rym: Now that I'm a better gamer and I'm older.

625
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,723
Rym: I like it a lot more.

626
00:39:53,743 --> 00:39:55,873
Rym: Mm-hmm Got.

627
00:39:55,934 --> 00:39:56,618
Rym: after that we play.

628
00:39:56,819 --> 00:39:58,369
Rym: Oh, we can skip some of these games.

629
00:39:59,093 --> 00:40:03,030
Scott: Yeah, just talk about whichever games, you know you bring up the game and I'll talk about it.

630
00:40:03,172 --> 00:40:07,783
Scott: All right, of course Outlaw Outlaw is actually one of my favorite Atari games.

631
00:40:08,044 --> 00:40:09,850
Scott: You got to understand the awesomeness of this game.

632
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:14,526
Rym: It's two stick figure cowboys shooting at each other with pixel guns.

633
00:40:14,707 --> 00:40:20,350
Rym: Yeehaw Like a cactus in the middle or stagecoaches going by and the game is so simple.

634
00:40:21,234 --> 00:40:28,499
Rym: it is straight up just a competition of bluffing and It's really just bluffing once everyone's good at it.

635
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:31,070
Rym: bluffing and I hand coordination and calculating angles.

636
00:40:31,391 --> 00:40:47,000
Scott: Yeah, I mean you can really only shoot bullets at 45 degree angles or zero degree angles And you got a cowboy on the left and a cowboy on the right and one guy shoots to the right and the other guy shoots to the left and in between You can choose to either have a cactus which is invincible.

637
00:40:47,582 --> 00:40:49,789
Scott: You can choose to have a stagecoach.

638
00:40:49,809 --> 00:40:59,075
Rym: Well, no, no You can have a cactus that's invincible with unlimited ammo a cactus that cactus that's invincible with limited ammo a cactus That's not invincible with unlimited ammo.

639
00:40:59,356 --> 00:41:02,284
Rym: Okay, every variation has limited and unlimited ammo.

640
00:41:02,485 --> 00:41:03,668
Rym: Yeah stagecoach.

641
00:41:03,768 --> 00:41:04,892
Rym: That's invincible That isn't.

642
00:41:05,113 --> 00:41:06,256
Rym: that's moving and invincible.

643
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,521
Rym: That's moving and not invincible.

644
00:41:07,802 --> 00:41:10,069
Rym: a wall a wall that's moving a wall that's moving.

645
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:17,330
Scott: and Yeah, there's a whole bunch of different combinations in case you get bored of the invincible cactus mode.

646
00:41:17,792 --> 00:41:21,650
Scott: But now, of course you get the bouncing bullets the non bouncing bullets.

647
00:41:22,851 --> 00:41:23,835
Scott: You know, it's all good.

648
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:26,142
Rym: I beat Scott every time.

649
00:41:26,222 --> 00:41:27,065
Scott: No, you didn't get it.

650
00:41:27,205 --> 00:41:29,095
Scott: I beat you many times infinite Am?

651
00:41:29,156 --> 00:41:29,685
Scott: I beat you?

652
00:41:29,746 --> 00:41:31,652
Scott: I beat Once.

653
00:41:31,672 --> 00:41:32,053
Rym: you beat me.

654
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:33,358
Scott: I beat you a couple times.

655
00:41:33,459 --> 00:41:35,024
Rym: No, you killed me a couple times.

656
00:41:35,345 --> 00:41:36,550
Scott: I think I beat you twice.

657
00:41:36,912 --> 00:41:37,978
Rym: No, you beat me one.

658
00:41:38,018 --> 00:41:41,279
Scott: I've ever beaten you twice and one of those stagecoaches I think I didn't.

659
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:42,429
Scott: I beat you on the bouncing cactus.

660
00:41:43,072 --> 00:41:50,703
Rym: You beat me on the second round we played which was unlimited ammo bouncing cactus Whatever and you beat me pretty thoroughly there, but I beat you everywhere else.

661
00:41:50,723 --> 00:41:51,365
Scott: It doesn't matter.

662
00:41:51,385 --> 00:41:52,168
Scott: I'm good at outlaw.

663
00:41:52,188 --> 00:41:53,780
Rym: No, you're not All right.

664
00:41:54,325 --> 00:41:58,050
Rym: combat Combat is a great game.

665
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:07,189
Rym: It's the same thing as outlaw almost only with little tanks little tanks and airplanes and you move around and it has modes like you Can only beat the guy if you hit him with a reflected shot and stuff like that.

666
00:42:07,812 --> 00:42:10,850
Rym: My favorite mode is invisible mode where it's just a blank screen.

667
00:42:11,131 --> 00:42:15,262
Rym: There's two tanks and you're both invisible and when you shoot you appear for a second.

668
00:42:15,784 --> 00:42:17,870
Rym: and I got to admit it was funny.

669
00:42:18,192 --> 00:42:20,850
Rym: Cuz we're both invisible and Scott's like how am I supposed to do this?

670
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:25,777
Scott: And I shot it cuz I used to be able to do invisible tank when I was a kid But now I can't freaking do that.

671
00:42:25,837 --> 00:42:26,902
Rym: Oh, where the fuck?

672
00:42:26,922 --> 00:42:27,183
Rym: how'd you?

673
00:42:27,203 --> 00:42:30,479
Rym: and I shot him again and I shot him again And I shot him again when I was invisible.

674
00:42:30,499 --> 00:42:31,585
Scott: He shot me.

675
00:42:31,867 --> 00:42:35,129
Scott: Yeah, like Scott I mean, I don't even know where I am, but somehow he's shooting me.

676
00:42:36,753 --> 00:42:38,690
Rym: See I had an Atari and I played it a lot.

677
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:41,830
Scott: In fact, I played my see I had an Atari but when I was three it broke.

678
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:45,443
Scott: So I only really played Pac Man a bunch of times and broke breakout and then that was it.

679
00:42:45,844 --> 00:42:49,710
Rym: even after I got a Super Nintendo I played my Atari regularly.

680
00:42:50,011 --> 00:42:58,823
Scott: Yeah, our Atari was gone by then so I didn't play it that long and I you know I played all those games but mostly at other people's houses and in the arcade and stuff like that.

681
00:42:58,843 --> 00:43:00,789
Rym: All right, Crystal Castle sucks ass.

682
00:43:01,653 --> 00:43:02,939
Scott: It was kind of sucky.

683
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,230
Scott: I'm good at it wasn't the worst thing ever though.

684
00:43:05,351 --> 00:43:12,670
Rym: well, it's a. as a kid the game scared the hell out of me because it was all these monsters and They were all kind of scary and they'd come out.

685
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:15,525
Rym: They weren't pretty scary and the game is just kind of hard.

686
00:43:15,565 --> 00:43:16,430
Rym: and so you're a teddy bear.

687
00:43:16,831 --> 00:43:20,184
Rym: Yeah, you're a teddy bear and these like giant skeletons are coming to kill you.

688
00:43:20,204 --> 00:43:22,533
Scott: The skeleton was awesome though He was.

689
00:43:22,573 --> 00:43:23,598
Rym: you didn't get to see the ghosts.

690
00:43:24,141 --> 00:43:24,703
Scott: Oh, man.

691
00:43:24,724 --> 00:43:25,970
Scott: I want to see the ghost.

692
00:43:26,373 --> 00:43:28,130
Rym: Yeah, like bees come and sting you to death.

693
00:43:28,537 --> 00:43:33,330
Scott: It's sort of like Qbert in a way that you're trying to touch the whole board without getting killed by monsters.

694
00:43:33,511 --> 00:43:35,317
Rym: It's like a cross between Qbert and pac-man.

695
00:43:35,458 --> 00:43:37,425
Rym: Yeah, that sounds kind of weird.

696
00:43:37,686 --> 00:43:40,073
Scott: and there's also honey and Hats.

697
00:43:40,758 --> 00:43:42,329
Rym: Yeah magic hats magic hats.

698
00:43:43,211 --> 00:43:43,472
Rym: Alright.

699
00:43:43,532 --> 00:43:44,977
Rym: now the next game we played.

700
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:46,201
Rym: Scott can't blame the controller.

701
00:43:46,623 --> 00:43:47,205
Rym: cuz cuz.

702
00:43:47,245 --> 00:43:48,670
Scott: I'm actually really good at this game.

703
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:50,137
Rym: Plus it's it's pitfall.

704
00:43:50,197 --> 00:43:54,938
Rym: Alright fucking pitfall no matter what controls you're using Unless your controller is physically broken.

705
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:58,010
Rym: The skill of pitfall is purely the skill of playing pitfall.

706
00:43:58,070 --> 00:44:00,581
Scott: It's just right left and pushing a button now.

707
00:44:01,003 --> 00:44:02,409
Rym: Scott talked a big game.

708
00:44:02,951 --> 00:44:04,898
Scott: Scott and I came out with a big game.

709
00:44:05,058 --> 00:44:08,690
Rym: Scott talked a big game and I did real good.

710
00:44:08,791 --> 00:44:10,463
Scott: I got two freaking treasures, man.

711
00:44:10,483 --> 00:44:16,210
Rym: I Got three past a fourth one and could have kept going but killed myself on purpose.

712
00:44:16,672 --> 00:44:18,378
Scott: Yeah, that's only cuz you went.

713
00:44:18,499 --> 00:44:23,378
Scott: second if you would have let you didn't then you turn the game off and if you gave If I had another try I would have gotten five treasures.

714
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:24,162
Rym: I doubt it.

715
00:44:24,342 --> 00:44:25,768
Scott: Yeah, I'm gonna beat pitfall.

716
00:44:25,809 --> 00:44:29,170
Rym: you watch The point out that Scott talked a really big game.

717
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:33,750
Rym: I mean, I can't make fun of him for losing it like kaboom because I'm Tommy at kaboom.

718
00:44:34,131 --> 00:44:36,280
Scott: I did pretty good at kaboom for not being Tommy.

719
00:44:36,461 --> 00:44:37,224
Rym: Yeah, he did really good.

720
00:44:37,244 --> 00:44:40,259
Rym: But me well well That's a paddle game.

721
00:44:40,299 --> 00:44:42,210
Rym: I can play that I can't make funny for the other games.

722
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:46,330
Rym: But you've talked a big fucking game for pitfall and I came out with a big game.

723
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,495
Scott: But it was the first try.

724
00:44:47,535 --> 00:44:51,470
Scott: and how many years you knew you'd only let me try it once one try.

725
00:44:51,551 --> 00:44:52,337
Scott: That was pretty good.

726
00:44:52,498 --> 00:44:53,969
Rym: It had been equally many years for me.

727
00:44:54,391 --> 00:44:56,458
Scott: Yeah, but you got to watch me play first.

728
00:44:56,619 --> 00:44:59,630
Scott: you got to see which boards are where I didn't matter.

729
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:00,794
Rym: It's the same every time.

730
00:45:00,835 --> 00:45:02,421
Rym: I have that game practically memorized.

731
00:45:02,461 --> 00:45:04,890
Scott: see that's that's not fair because I don't have it memorized.

732
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:09,935
Scott: I just memorize how to do each kind of board, but uh It's the same game everywhere.

733
00:45:09,955 --> 00:45:10,837
Scott: No, it's it.

734
00:45:11,218 --> 00:45:16,151
Rym: I don't memorize pitfall you I memorized it in terms of I know where all the treasures Are.

735
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:17,658
Scott: I don't know where the treasures are.

736
00:45:17,678 --> 00:45:20,049
Scott: I just keep going and trying to get until I get them all.

737
00:45:21,491 --> 00:45:24,685
Rym: Yeah, you talk a big game and then I don't have a big game at pitfall.

738
00:45:24,705 --> 00:45:27,597
Rym: I'm great at it didn't even break 10,000. that's cuz.

739
00:45:27,658 --> 00:45:32,296
Scott: it was the first time I played in years first time I played in years But you knew the game still.

740
00:45:32,497 --> 00:45:34,143
Rym: so why would you talk a big game?

741
00:45:34,223 --> 00:45:39,002
Rym: if I know the game and I'm good at it You're not good because I am good at it, but you sucked at.

742
00:45:39,022 --> 00:45:40,106
Scott: I just don't have memorized.

743
00:45:40,126 --> 00:45:42,255
Scott: and I did really well Not really.

744
00:45:42,275 --> 00:45:46,874
Scott: Yeah, really getting three treasures is nothing It's nothing.

745
00:45:46,914 --> 00:45:47,899
Scott: yeah next time I'll beat it.

746
00:45:47,939 --> 00:45:50,108
Scott: you watch you'll see I could be pitfall.

747
00:45:51,433 --> 00:45:53,661
Rym: I'm just ragging on Scott because he's good.

748
00:45:53,681 --> 00:45:55,066
Rym: I mean, he's really good at video games.

749
00:45:55,126 --> 00:45:56,250
Rym: Just not at Atari.

750
00:45:56,432 --> 00:46:11,066
Scott: I'm good at Atari games Super controller and I can't Frickin be expected to be amazing and kicking ass at a game that I haven't played that much in my life that I'm kind of Good at in one try the first try in years.

751
00:46:11,327 --> 00:46:15,570
Rym: I'm fine I'll give you all that but you have to admit that I'm better than you at Atari games.

752
00:46:16,291 --> 00:46:17,399
Scott: You're only better than me.

753
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:26,937
Scott: Hey at Certain games in the Atari 1700 because you played them for years of your life You can actually use that controller.

754
00:46:27,078 --> 00:46:28,382
Rym: but uh, I suck at.

755
00:46:28,402 --> 00:46:31,769
Rym: you know, Mega Man 2 and the only reason you're good at it You played it a whole bunch.

756
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:34,823
Scott: No, even if you played Mega Man 2 a whole bunch you wouldn't be as good as I am.

757
00:46:35,506 --> 00:46:38,083
Rym: I probably would no fine you.

758
00:46:39,391 --> 00:46:41,359
Rym: Which let's see who will win first.

759
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:44,230
Rym: you beat bionic commando or I beat Mega Man 2.

760
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:45,299
Rym: Does that have to be the competition?

761
00:46:45,339 --> 00:46:46,508
Scott: Mega Man 2 is an easier game?

762
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:48,656
Rym: Bionic commando is really easy.

763
00:46:48,676 --> 00:46:49,419
Rym: I don't know.

764
00:46:49,459 --> 00:46:51,690
Scott: I never really tried to get past the first level.

765
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:53,396
Rym: You can borrow that Capcom mini-mix.

766
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:53,737
Rym: I bought.

767
00:46:53,898 --> 00:46:54,459
Scott: I'll try.

768
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,510
Scott: Yeah, I never actually tried to beat bionic commando at all.

769
00:46:57,812 --> 00:47:01,273
Scott: I kind of played it for a few minutes and then be like, okay Wow, yeah.

770
00:47:01,293 --> 00:47:01,995
Rym: All right.

771
00:47:02,035 --> 00:47:03,939
Rym: So yards revenge is just terrible.

772
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:14,808
Scott: Yeah, it's I don't know Atari guys are like, yeah yards revenge is like the awesome amazing Atari thing.

773
00:47:14,928 --> 00:47:21,730
Rym: It's To quote what was used to see because I listened to like 10 of their episodes in the last week and one they're really cool.

774
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:23,158
Rym: they're good podcast about movies.

775
00:47:23,198 --> 00:47:32,290
Rym: a little plug here, but They you know They're British and they use British isms and they always say like when something's shitty like Americans say, oh, that's shitty.

776
00:47:32,572 --> 00:47:38,316
Rym: They always say well, it's a bit shit It's a bit shit And it's grown on me.

777
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:39,682
Rym: I like saying that it's a bit shit.

778
00:47:40,365 --> 00:47:41,149
Rym: this game's a bit shit.

779
00:47:42,492 --> 00:47:48,737
Rym: See cuz I love they were making fun of American accents one day and I love hearing Non-americans do American accents.

780
00:47:49,038 --> 00:47:49,981
Rym: So it's I love.

781
00:47:50,062 --> 00:47:52,630
Scott: I also love hearing non-americans do American accent.

782
00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:58,930
Rym: So I hope you all enjoy hearing your accents done poorly even though like I know we have a lot of Australian listeners in there.

783
00:47:59,091 --> 00:48:01,876
Rym: I can't do anything on a Crikey.

784
00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:14,082
Rym: Oh I'm sorry to Australia.

785
00:48:14,505 --> 00:48:15,290
Rym: You guys are awesome.

786
00:48:15,631 --> 00:48:21,190
Rym: In fact, I was talking to my grandpa today cuz he loves Australia and he spent like a month there, but I digress.

787
00:48:22,131 --> 00:48:26,390
Rym: I don't think we're gonna talk about any more Atari games because I don't want to go long on an episode.

788
00:48:26,471 --> 00:48:31,456
Rym: We're just laughing at Scott about a target Happen at rain cuz.

789
00:48:31,476 --> 00:48:33,749
Scott: he played too many shitty Atari games.

790
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:36,536
Scott: Only some of them are awesome.

791
00:48:36,576 --> 00:48:37,319
Scott: Most of them are shit.

792
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:39,627
Scott: They're a bit shit shit a bit.

793
00:48:39,727 --> 00:48:43,922
Scott: It's a bit You can't be a bit shit time Stan.

794
00:48:43,942 --> 00:48:46,574
Rym: that was lame Whatever.

795
00:48:46,594 --> 00:48:47,339
Rym: All right.

796
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:48,830
Rym: I think we're descending into silliness.

797
00:48:49,472 --> 00:49:02,164
Rym: I'll end this by saying that if you can find an emulator and you're in any way a video game fan It behooves you to play all of the Atari games you can find.

798
00:49:02,204 --> 00:49:04,630
Rym: I mean don't play them a lot don't get good at.

799
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:11,349
Scott: Yeah, just at least turn each ROM on and try to play it for a little bit and then you know Some of them will actually be fun.

800
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:17,472
Scott: Keep playing those like pitfall and some of them won't be fun like the shitty version of pac-man for the 2600.

801
00:49:17,472 --> 00:49:18,375
Scott: God, don't play.

802
00:49:18,395 --> 00:49:20,221
Rym: that was like the worst game ever made.

803
00:49:20,282 --> 00:49:21,265
Scott: Yeah, just don't play those.

804
00:49:21,727 --> 00:49:22,289
Rym: I mean it really.

805
00:49:23,352 --> 00:49:31,070
Rym: Video games have come a long way But a lot of modern video games seem to miss the point that the point of a video game is that it's fun.

806
00:49:31,652 --> 00:49:34,301
Rym: And there are games that don't look fun.

807
00:49:34,341 --> 00:49:39,909
Rym: And even the people who are fans of the games When they play them, they don't look like they're having fun.

808
00:49:40,772 --> 00:49:46,849
Scott: It's like they're playing them like it's a chore or they're you know, they're playing it to like unlock a story bit or something.

809
00:49:47,673 --> 00:49:50,610
Rym: Plus, I mean you'll see games that you know, the game is a bit shit.

810
00:49:50,931 --> 00:50:00,649
Rym: But you'll play it and then you'll play a modern game and realize that the modern game is Essentially the same game that was on the Atari just polished a little bit.

811
00:50:01,911 --> 00:50:06,062
Scott: Yeah, someone should make a frickin modern Yars revenge then it wouldn't suck.

812
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:08,810
Rym: Someone should remake every Atari game modern.

813
00:50:10,073 --> 00:50:21,361
Rym: And they've done it quite a bit in a flash with good great No straight-up port just with good graphics like Xbox 360 graphics, but it's just like Yars revenge This exact same game with the same controls.

814
00:50:21,863 --> 00:50:23,128
Scott: It's been done many times.

815
00:50:23,309 --> 00:50:29,754
Rym: Yeah All right, so I'll leave you with that and tomorrow we will have our coverage of Citicon 2006.
