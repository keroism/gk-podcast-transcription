1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,287
Scott: It's Wednesday April 14th.

2
00:00:11,447 --> 00:00:11,989
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,229 --> 00:00:20,803
Scott: I'm red and this is GeekNights tonight the Museum of comic and cartoon art festival 2010.

4
00:00:20,803 --> 00:00:23,535
Rym: every time we do a mocha opener you always kind of say it slow like that.

5
00:00:24,197 --> 00:00:24,820
Scott: It's hard to say.

6
00:00:26,961 --> 00:00:31,364
Rym: Let's do this For the last like week.

7
00:00:31,424 --> 00:00:34,388
Rym: I've been rollerblading home from work in the city.

8
00:00:34,769 --> 00:00:35,850
Scott: It's gonna rain tomorrow though.

9
00:00:36,051 --> 00:00:41,686
Rym: Yeah, so I'm probably not going to do it tomorrow Which is fine because I'm finally going to the DMV to give up the Otari license plate.

10
00:00:41,706 --> 00:00:44,058
Rym: Oh It's the end of an era.

11
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,870
Scott: I always still have to go to the DMV.

12
00:00:46,031 --> 00:00:46,633
Scott: Also, I'm gonna.

13
00:00:46,653 --> 00:00:50,286
Scott: I gotta find a way that I need one in Harlem is open until six.

14
00:00:50,547 --> 00:00:51,290
Scott: That's not late enough.

15
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,394
Scott: I got like maybe eight.

16
00:00:52,555 --> 00:00:56,110
Scott: It's I have to go to the doctor the dentist and the DMV and I know the 3ds.

17
00:00:56,672 --> 00:00:57,635
Rym: That's pretty dangerous.

18
00:00:57,776 --> 00:00:58,840
Scott: Yeah, so I got it.

19
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,290
Scott: I got to like schedule it to take the minimum time off work.

20
00:01:01,612 --> 00:01:03,510
Rym: Just take a day off and then use the day to dick around.

21
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:07,893
Scott: That's the four DS Dr.

22
00:01:07,993 --> 00:01:08,355
Scott: Dennis.

23
00:01:08,616 --> 00:01:10,041
Scott: DMV dick around.

24
00:01:10,202 --> 00:01:14,518
Rym: Well, the doctor might also involve some dicking Hopefully not the DMV.

25
00:01:14,538 --> 00:01:15,100
Rym: Definitely.

26
00:01:15,221 --> 00:01:17,169
Scott: I mean I need some doctoring but not in the dick.

27
00:01:19,111 --> 00:01:24,466
Rym: But I have some observations about rollerblading in New York City, you know, just almost no one does it.

28
00:01:25,107 --> 00:01:29,980
Scott: actually today I think as long as I've lived here, I've seen three people today.

29
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:42,084
Rym: Today I ran into not literally three Individual rollerbladers other than myself and when I stopped and waited Did you ask them like where they were getting their like rollerblade stuff from now?

30
00:01:42,366 --> 00:01:43,470
Rym: They were just going past me.

31
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:44,396
Rym: I didn't want to stop.

32
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,330
Rym: cuz you know rollerblades it takes a while to get up to speed.

33
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:47,496
Rym: You did not want to slow down.

34
00:01:47,516 --> 00:01:54,836
Rym: That's the main reason why I'm on the sidewalk anyway, so Observation number one the most important one.

35
00:01:55,538 --> 00:01:58,887
Rym: number of times Rym has almost been hit by a car running a red light?

36
00:01:59,348 --> 00:02:05,030
Rym: zero Number of times Rym has almost been hit by a jackass bicyclist running a red light.

37
00:02:06,711 --> 00:02:11,845
Rym: You're counting eleven times have I had a green light and I go to rollerblades.

38
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:13,390
Rym: some jackass biker almost hits me.

39
00:02:13,612 --> 00:02:17,557
Rym: Yeah, the cars are fine It's the bikers Even though I noticed biking.

40
00:02:17,577 --> 00:02:22,174
Scott: cuz when you know when your bike like when I got the Mazda 3 suddenly you notice every other Mazda 3 on the road.

41
00:02:22,355 --> 00:02:25,169
Scott: Yeah, as soon as I'm biking I notice all the other bikes on the road.

42
00:02:25,732 --> 00:02:31,350
Rym: So the thing here's the thing, you know why you're noticing all these assholes on the road anyway.

43
00:02:32,594 --> 00:02:34,671
Scott: now the So.

44
00:02:35,012 --> 00:02:46,299
Scott: so the thing is right, you know, sometimes there are cars that are sort of you know, annoying like I'll be like Hey, dude, give me some room or like they'll double park and it's like great now I can't get around you and this car is going by.

45
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,850
Scott: and if unless I can't go past any further unless I go on the Sidewalk and sometimes that's annoying dude

46
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,215
Rym: You haven't driven in the Bronx and

47
00:02:53,296 --> 00:03:06,359
Scott: but you know and sometimes a car will I get behind me and be like beep beep And be like, hey, yeah, you know and it's like, okay, whatever, you know, I can you know sort of understand even it's a little bleh But the bikes are just like whatever.

48
00:03:06,399 --> 00:03:06,961
Scott: Whoo.

49
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:08,085
Scott: I see even like old man.

50
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:13,101
Scott: Just run in the red line You know, the bikes are way worse than the cars.

51
00:03:13,141 --> 00:03:21,746
Rym: and I'm on the bike saying this, you know, yeah So, I don't know I mean I want a bike but I almost don't want to be associated with all those other bikers.

52
00:03:21,766 --> 00:03:30,255
Scott: then be like me stop with The fucking red lights, you know Don't freakin, you know ring your little horn and everybody We'll see.

53
00:03:30,316 --> 00:03:31,849
Rym: the thing is I don't know how much like it.

54
00:03:32,091 --> 00:03:38,657
Rym: I don't know if it'll be that much faster to bike just because it's so short as it is and the primary thing slowing me Down even rollerblading is red lights.

55
00:03:39,381 --> 00:03:41,149
Scott: No, the thing is it's way fast.

56
00:03:42,211 --> 00:03:52,260
Scott: The bike like you go over that bridge and it's just like like I'm like even when I'm pedaling up the hill on the bridge going Yeah, right and I like.

57
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:57,298
Scott: I look at the little fence that prevents you from falling off the bridge and I watch how fast the fence is going by.

58
00:03:57,378 --> 00:04:00,208
Scott: it's like fence post fence post fence post fence post fence.

59
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:02,566
Scott: and it's like Wow, if I was walking you'd be like fence post.

60
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,808
Scott: Yeah Fence posts, you know.

61
00:04:06,315 --> 00:04:17,904
Scott: So it's like wow even just pedaling really go and struggling in a low gear up a hill on this bridge is Significantly faster than pretty much, you know anything.

62
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:19,010
Rym: but what amazes me is how many?

63
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,034
Rym: Bikes who end up.

64
00:04:21,075 --> 00:04:22,923
Rym: they walk their bikes up that little tiny hill.

65
00:04:23,024 --> 00:04:32,812
Scott: I see some people walking it up I see some people using the wrong gear, but the thing is it's like it's always like, you know, there is no like stereotype of Bicycling.

66
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:33,053
Scott: like.

67
00:04:33,374 --> 00:04:40,200
Scott: you'll see people who like you like if you saw them just walking around the street normal clothes You might think oh that person, you know, they don't know.

68
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,629
Scott: now they're like going way faster than me some old lady.

69
00:04:43,172 --> 00:04:52,013
Rym: Well with bicycles in particular I think everyone knows how to ride a bike and New York is just a place where that skill is actually useful Mmm-hmm.

70
00:04:52,274 --> 00:04:57,727
Rym: I think that a lot of people ride bikes just because it's useful and everyone learns not to ride a bike when they're a kid except Greg.

71
00:04:59,272 --> 00:05:07,408
Rym: So on Sunday is the non sequitur And Sunday, you can't make something a sequitur by simply declaring that it was a non sequitur.

72
00:05:07,428 --> 00:05:07,929
Rym: Yes, you can.

73
00:05:08,634 --> 00:05:10,990
Scott: So on Sunday, I made some manueva cochina.

74
00:05:12,134 --> 00:05:13,083
Scott: It was so tasty.

75
00:05:13,123 --> 00:05:13,608
Rym: I like it, too.

76
00:05:14,172 --> 00:05:18,449
Scott: So then you know Monday just sat in the fridge and yet last night I ate it again.

77
00:05:19,032 --> 00:05:21,685
Scott: But you didn't want to come and help me eat it even though I had so much like.

78
00:05:21,725 --> 00:05:24,939
Rym: I did want to come and help You eat it, but I had other important things to do.

79
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:25,441
Rym: Uh-huh.

80
00:05:25,722 --> 00:05:27,530
Rym: I was editing YouTube videos.

81
00:05:27,711 --> 00:05:30,945
Rym: You know the GeekNights YouTube stream is gonna come online at some point.

82
00:05:30,965 --> 00:05:32,150
Scott: You sure you weren't dicking around.

83
00:05:32,471 --> 00:05:34,419
Rym: I was also playing DDR.

84
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,543
Rym: cuz I got a setup again.

85
00:05:35,563 --> 00:05:40,175
Scott: It does the 50 Initial D that 60s.

86
00:05:40,336 --> 00:05:41,000
Scott: You know what?

87
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:41,543
Rym: You know what?

88
00:05:41,704 --> 00:05:42,630
Rym: I got to save this for Tuesday.

89
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:43,534
Rym: I'm not gonna talk about DDR.

90
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:46,286
Rym: I'll say one thing I fucking miss playing that shit.

91
00:05:46,487 --> 00:05:47,190
Scott: DDR is the best.

92
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:50,001
Rym: Oh my god Wildwood doesn't do it for me cuz I'm not.

93
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,250
Rym: the memory in Wildwood is so dancing.

94
00:05:52,711 --> 00:05:55,380
Rym: It's so like you can't hear the music and everyone sucks.

95
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:59,698
Rym: and I kind of forgot how great it is to just have the loud Music using step mania.

96
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:00,583
Rym: Yeah, of course.

97
00:06:00,623 --> 00:06:01,750
Rym: Okay, and you know what?

98
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:04,846
Rym: I downloaded some torrent of every step mania song.

99
00:06:04,986 --> 00:06:05,529
Rym: ever me too.

100
00:06:05,891 --> 00:06:09,785
Rym: It has DDR first mix second mix third mix fifth mix six.

101
00:06:09,865 --> 00:06:11,210
Scott: We got the same torrent.

102
00:06:11,391 --> 00:06:12,136
Emily: Where the hell is?

103
00:06:12,196 --> 00:06:14,229
Scott: it had a fourth mix folder that was empty, right?

104
00:06:15,113 --> 00:06:18,308
Rym: It actually was full but there were no arrows in there just mp3.

105
00:06:18,891 --> 00:06:21,699
Scott: Oh really the one I got was all arrows and no mp3s.

106
00:06:22,562 --> 00:06:25,210
Scott: Ah, but I did get this Konami official folder.

107
00:06:25,471 --> 00:06:26,274
Rym: I downloaded that.

108
00:06:26,294 --> 00:06:26,996
Rym: I didn't look in it.

109
00:06:27,016 --> 00:06:32,317
Scott: yet the Konami official folder that came in the same torrent as the everything else Had a bunch of fourth mix in it.

110
00:06:32,378 --> 00:06:34,710
Scott: cuz it was like night in motion and shit weird problem.

111
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:35,472
Rym: Where are you?

112
00:06:35,733 --> 00:06:36,314
Rym: so get this.

113
00:06:37,257 --> 00:06:41,208
Rym: I started to play and I was sucking like bad and I'm thinking I'm hurt.

114
00:06:41,428 --> 00:06:42,130
Rym: I'm hurt real bad.

115
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:42,754
Rym: What's going on?

116
00:06:42,774 --> 00:06:43,459
Rym: Do I suck at DDR?

117
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,526
Scott: Are you a monkey?

118
00:06:44,687 --> 00:06:48,501
Rym: Is it the Actually downloaded that announcer me too.

119
00:06:48,561 --> 00:06:49,305
Scott: I also got that.

120
00:06:49,627 --> 00:06:50,270
Rym: that's the best one.

121
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:53,770
Scott: But I need to get Alice character pack and also Baldo character pack.

122
00:06:53,910 --> 00:07:11,850
Rym: I was doing so bad and then I thought wait a minute and I turned on the auto sync for one song Which let it little look at how you're dancing and then it'll use the statistical deviation of your steps based on whether like when you hit Close but you're off by a couple milliseconds to figure out how offset the arrows are from the music.

123
00:07:12,271 --> 00:07:14,036
Rym: Mmm, and it offs.

124
00:07:14,096 --> 00:07:16,804
Rym: it changed everything by point one one nine seconds.

125
00:07:17,386 --> 00:07:18,689
Rym: Mm-hmm, and then everything was great.

126
00:07:19,452 --> 00:07:20,676
Rym: But then I thought wait a minute.

127
00:07:21,178 --> 00:07:24,730
Rym: Maybe I just calibrated this now differently from every DDR machine.

128
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,235
Rym: I'm gonna screw myself in the long run.

129
00:07:26,496 --> 00:07:27,017
Rym: Mm-hmm.

130
00:07:27,078 --> 00:07:28,683
Rym: So I started calibrating.

131
00:07:29,024 --> 00:07:29,766
Rym: like every song.

132
00:07:29,786 --> 00:07:30,288
Rym: I went through 15 songs.

133
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:32,459
Rym: I was within point.

134
00:07:32,822 --> 00:07:36,056
Rym: Oh three milliseconds Deviation on all of them.

135
00:07:36,537 --> 00:07:40,048
Rym: So there's a delay in the Mac going to the HDTV.

136
00:07:40,429 --> 00:07:43,147
Rym: Oh Where the delay is.

137
00:07:43,691 --> 00:07:53,832
Rym: Okay, I was like what but I felt very precise in my dancing that I was that I am within point zero zero three milliseconds not millisecond seconds of Perfect timing.

138
00:07:54,394 --> 00:07:59,770
Scott: but anyway getting back to my point is I last night I ate some leftover Nuevo cochina and there's even more left over.

139
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,516
Rym: Oh my god, you can eat it again tonight.

140
00:08:01,696 --> 00:08:04,686
Scott: No, no, maybe tomorrow, but the like keep that long.

141
00:08:04,987 --> 00:08:05,388
Scott: Yeah, why not?

142
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,033
Scott: No microwaving it.

143
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:12,534
Scott: So if there's anything nasty thing in there, it's getting hosed unless it already made its poison That's true.

144
00:08:12,554 --> 00:08:16,858
Scott: But um, I So I ate two burritos last night.

145
00:08:16,878 --> 00:08:19,406
Scott: Hey, my stomach was so gurgly.

146
00:08:19,446 --> 00:08:20,450
Scott: It's even gurgling now.

147
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:23,058
Scott: It's that's great is the ultimate gurgle.

148
00:08:23,238 --> 00:08:26,107
Rym: So anime comics all that stuff.

149
00:08:26,568 --> 00:08:33,748
Rym: Hi everybody Heard about us from anime Boston saw our panels saw the link to the slideshow that you all asked about.

150
00:08:33,788 --> 00:08:34,330
Rym: it's online.

151
00:08:35,412 --> 00:08:37,842
Rym: All I want to say is we're not talking about anime Boston tonight.

152
00:08:37,863 --> 00:08:39,409
Rym: We're gonna talk about the mocha first.

153
00:08:40,331 --> 00:08:41,556
Rym: So, I don't know anime Boston.

154
00:08:41,576 --> 00:08:42,339
Rym: there's not a lot to say.

155
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,629
Rym: we recorded a show already, but we're not gonna upload it just yet.

156
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:47,462
Scott: No, it was a convention of anime.

157
00:08:47,482 --> 00:08:50,660
Scott: Yeah, we did some panels We seem to go over.

158
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,149
Scott: Well, we went to some panels.

159
00:08:52,792 --> 00:08:53,998
Scott: We walked around the dealers room.

160
00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:56,730
Scott: once we walked around the artists alley a couple times.

161
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:09,506
Rym: Darryl Surratt was as always incredibly impressive with his mad array of mad panels And we saw we hung out with people and I'm sorry guys anime Boston was fun and all.

162
00:09:09,546 --> 00:09:11,114
Rym: but The we be.

163
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:14,570
Rym: it being the weekend after packs just it's really hard.

164
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:20,837
Rym: It's like riding the biggest roller coaster in the world and then riding the kiddie coaster like five times in a row It doesn't matter how many times you ride it.

165
00:09:20,877 --> 00:09:21,720
Rym: It just can't compare.

166
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:27,009
Scott: Yeah, so it's like you ride the big roller coaster Whoo, and then you ride the kiddie coaster and you're basically taking a nap on it.

167
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:30,790
Rym: You know if I'd gone to anime Boston the weekend before packs, it would have been great.

168
00:09:31,011 --> 00:09:32,055
Scott: That's what they should have done.

169
00:09:32,556 --> 00:09:33,359
Rym: Well, they there's.

170
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:36,290
Rym: I don't think there was anyone who had a chance to change that situation.

171
00:09:37,211 --> 00:09:40,450
Scott: The anime Boston could have just scheduled two weeks earlier.

172
00:09:41,371 --> 00:09:42,857
Rym: But when did packs actually schedule?

173
00:09:42,897 --> 00:09:45,949
Rym: and when do I remember when they announced where paxies was going to be?

174
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:47,516
Scott: It doesn't matter.

175
00:09:47,576 --> 00:09:48,810
Rym: It was too late to get the Sheraton.

176
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:53,485
Scott: So hopefully they just there won't be the same weekend cuz that'll be the end of ahead of my boss.

177
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:54,649
Rym: Yeah, at least for us.

178
00:09:54,911 --> 00:10:00,262
Rym: Yeah, oh Well, so I got any anime manga comic media news.

179
00:10:00,663 --> 00:10:07,490
Scott: I do indeed, you know at the mocha I was noticing that you know the you know fan of graphics started doing the oshihiro tatsumi stuff.

180
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:16,022
Scott: But the gecky guy action see, you know in the the you know, the indie underground comics of Japan They're starting to bubble up even more in the indie comics.

181
00:10:16,143 --> 00:10:17,267
Scott: publishers of the u.s.

182
00:10:17,307 --> 00:10:22,570
Scott: Are picking them up You know and it not just fan of graphics brothers like top shelf and such, you know, it's pretty interesting.

183
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:28,329
Scott: It must have been a success for you know fan of graphics if other people are following suit anyway.

184
00:10:29,612 --> 00:10:40,009
Scott: A top shelf is gonna publish a 400 page compilation of stories from a you know underground Anthology of manga from Japan called ax.

185
00:10:40,992 --> 00:10:48,812
Scott: The guy who's in charge of ax named Akino kando is gonna come to New York City on April 21st Next weekend.

186
00:10:49,133 --> 00:10:50,217
Scott: Is it really next weekend?

187
00:10:50,257 --> 00:10:50,758
Scott: I think so.

188
00:10:50,778 --> 00:10:51,741
Scott: Oh shit.

189
00:10:52,022 --> 00:10:52,584
Rym: Yeah next week.

190
00:10:52,644 --> 00:10:53,687
Scott: No, it's next Wednesday.

191
00:10:53,707 --> 00:10:54,510
Scott: It's a week from today.

192
00:10:54,812 --> 00:10:55,316
Scott: Oh crap.

193
00:10:55,518 --> 00:10:56,446
Rym: Oh, yeah Wednesday.

194
00:10:56,647 --> 00:11:12,870
Scott: Yeah And the thing is he's doing it at this exhibit that's going on and the exhibit is a showcase of all 120 issues of Garo which is like the original real deal gecky guy magazine that you know tatsumi and others worked on.

195
00:11:13,312 --> 00:11:25,374
Scott: So not only do I get to go hear this like, you know modern Underground manga dude talk, but I also get to see every issue of Garo ever in this museum exhibit So it's gonna be totally sweet.

196
00:11:25,394 --> 00:11:26,338
Rym: Well, it's even worse.

197
00:11:26,378 --> 00:11:32,477
Rym: There's an opening reception that we could go to but it's Already happened from 6 to 8 p.m.

198
00:11:32,517 --> 00:11:32,859
Rym: Today.

199
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:33,461
Rym: Yeah.

200
00:11:33,501 --> 00:11:34,224
Scott: No, I didn't.

201
00:11:34,304 --> 00:11:36,580
Scott: I knew about that a while ago But I didn't want what's.

202
00:11:36,721 --> 00:11:37,469
Scott: I didn't want to go to it.

203
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:41,290
Rym: You know, it looks like it's interesting looking at the picture of them.

204
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:41,837
Rym: It's never.

205
00:11:41,918 --> 00:11:45,698
Scott: it's never a good idea Like, you know, I mean people like to go to like openings.

206
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:48,266
Scott: gallery openings or exhibit openings are great.

207
00:11:48,326 --> 00:11:51,150
Rym: Here's why one free wine Two free cheese and crackers, right?

208
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,179
Scott: The thing is if you act, you know, that's fine.

209
00:11:53,219 --> 00:12:03,355
Scott: if you want wine cheese and crackers, which I do But if you just how I survived RIT if you actually want to see the exhibit going to the opening is actually pretty bad Because that's the time.

210
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:04,419
Scott: It is the most crowded.

211
00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:05,864
Scott: There's the most people in your way.

212
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,229
Rym: It's tough though, because it's always

213
00:12:07,611 --> 00:12:12,250
Scott: I like to go at a time like when no one else is there so you can just totally take your time

214
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:19,848
Rym: underestimating the factor of the fact that most of the people who go to the openings of these things are going primarily to Hobnob with the other people there.

215
00:12:20,851 --> 00:12:23,930
Scott: Yeah, that's saying is I'm saying, you know as opposed to look at the art.

216
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:27,229
Rym: So the few times I've gone to a gallery opening like that was a big deal.

217
00:12:28,192 --> 00:12:38,204
Rym: Most of the people there were kind of standing in the middle talking Drinking the wine eating the cheese and I just went looked at all the art with no one in my way Possible depending on the size and shape of the the gallery.

218
00:12:38,344 --> 00:12:41,183
Rym: But well, yes, I mean if it's shit I don't know what shape would be bad.

219
00:12:41,223 --> 00:12:42,049
Rym: Maybe a hexagon.

220
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:45,652
Rym: So That it.

221
00:12:46,415 --> 00:12:46,836
Scott: yeah, that's it.

222
00:12:46,856 --> 00:12:47,177
Scott: so I got.

223
00:12:47,398 --> 00:12:48,402
Rym: yeah, I don't have too much.

224
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:50,149
Rym: I'm watching a vote Tom.

225
00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:51,961
Rym: slowly I get some DVDs from Scott.

226
00:12:52,263 --> 00:12:56,361
Rym: I started watching Yamato, but I think I'm gonna hold actually watching the.

227
00:12:56,522 --> 00:13:00,539
Rym: I'm gonna hold off on the Yamato because I gotta watch all the vote Toms first so we can actually review it.

228
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:01,363
Rym: Mm-hmm.

229
00:13:01,504 --> 00:13:02,288
Rym: I think it's actually worth.

230
00:13:02,328 --> 00:13:03,595
Scott: Yeah I've watched both.

231
00:13:03,715 --> 00:13:06,950
Scott: so you can pick whichever one and we can review how much vote Tom's first.

232
00:13:07,051 --> 00:13:07,393
Rym: I gotta.

233
00:13:07,736 --> 00:13:14,190
Rym: it takes a lot longer to watch both times Yeah, but I'll power through it and I'm almost caught up on Dora which is fucking awesome.

234
00:13:14,692 --> 00:13:20,616
Scott: You know the last episode of Dora, I think I don't know if there's a new one on crunchyroll yet But the last one I watched right?

235
00:13:20,656 --> 00:13:23,145
Scott: I think it was episode 12 or 13.

236
00:13:23,145 --> 00:13:24,450
Scott: It seemed like the end of the show.

237
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:32,926
Scott: It's like oh the show's over and then I went and apparently I talked to you know Some friends of ours who also watched all the episodes that were up there and they're like, no, this is like 24 episodes total.

238
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,763
Scott: That's like the halfway climax.

239
00:13:35,784 --> 00:13:41,750
Scott: I was like wow Good, you'll get to an episode and you'd be like, oh, that's the ending right there and it's not the ending.

240
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:48,090
Scott: It's like oh shit, but my prediction in Dora that I predicted way early was absolutely correct.

241
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:57,267
Scott: So the show is not so good at being like, you know Keeping its mysteries mysterious, but it is still pretty good at being entertaining and awesome.

242
00:13:57,347 --> 00:14:08,765
Rym: So yeah So things of the day.

243
00:14:08,785 --> 00:14:13,417
Rym: I made a critical fatal error recently and now is the time to correct it.

244
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,745
Rym: I Go to College Humor.

245
00:14:15,765 --> 00:14:20,283
Rym: that's where I steal most of my thing of the day videos as many of you smart people may have been Able to figure out.

246
00:14:20,665 --> 00:14:23,580
Scott: let's not let's link to like the YouTube version of this video.

247
00:14:27,641 --> 00:14:29,347
Scott: Well, I'd make the pose so guess what.

248
00:14:29,548 --> 00:14:33,020
Rym: but regardless now normally I pride myself in my internet filter.

249
00:14:33,141 --> 00:14:34,874
Rym: I mean, you know, well Scott now will be sitting there.

250
00:14:34,894 --> 00:14:45,469
Rym: We'll have friends over we'll be going through the College Humor or some other site looking at funny videos and Scott my usually we look through and we pinpoint like that one will be funny That one's not worth watching.

251
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:46,114
Rym: that will be funny.

252
00:14:46,134 --> 00:14:47,060
Rym: That was not worth watching.

253
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:47,723
Rym: We got a filter.

254
00:14:48,084 --> 00:14:54,711
Rym: we're always on the same page and all the kind of inexperienced people will sit there and be like, ah What about that one cute dog blah blah?

255
00:14:54,731 --> 00:14:56,158
Rym: that looks good, but they're never good.

256
00:14:56,479 --> 00:15:00,980
Rym: Yep Well, uh my filter for the first time in my life has failed me.

257
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,120
Scott: Well, I to your credit right and you know to the credit of our filters, right?

258
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,513
Scott: It wasn't a situation of a false positive reset.

259
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:08,660
Scott: Oh, this will be good and it sucked.

260
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:12,311
Scott: It's a situation of you said, oh that sucked and it was good.

261
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,180
Rym: So I filter filters out pretty much all the plankton.

262
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:23,650
Scott: Yeah, as long as you get as long as you don't watch any bad things if you miss some good things It's okay cuz good things come around again, especially from the vault or whatever.

263
00:15:24,321 --> 00:15:28,057
Scott: Whereas if you you know, you just want to avoid wasting time on bad things and you're all set.

264
00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:38,422
Rym: So Gary oak, I'm Gary oak with my cribby crab is this is just fucking hilarious Miss tea, there's nothing else to say about it.

265
00:15:38,763 --> 00:15:39,306
Rym: pedophile.

266
00:15:39,547 --> 00:15:47,061
Scott: That's right Let's see, okay, so my thing of the day here is totally awesome.

267
00:15:47,081 --> 00:15:55,890
Scott: it is a is for As a four as takes in atomic armor attacking anomalous amphibians.

268
00:15:56,892 --> 00:16:01,056
Scott: So what this is here, it's I guess unreality magazine Which I've never heard of before.

269
00:16:01,116 --> 00:16:05,132
Scott: but they've got a post here and the post is the most badass Alphabet ever.

270
00:16:05,193 --> 00:16:14,611
Scott: and it looks like they got a different artist to do each letter of the alphabet in some nerdy fashion with alliteration and You know.

271
00:16:14,651 --> 00:16:20,350
Scott: and so there's an illustration and an alliteration in nerd fashion for every single letter of the alphabet by a different artist.

272
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:21,836
Rym: So I saw one of these before.

273
00:16:21,857 --> 00:16:22,821
Rym: I didn't realize it was the thing.

274
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:24,910
Rym: I just saw W like links over.

275
00:16:25,111 --> 00:16:30,269
Scott: so for P it's like Peter Parker playing ping-pong with Pikachu and there's a hilarious picture.

276
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:38,210
Scott: and For K there K is for kiss King Kong and it's King Kong throwing up the horns with some kiss makeup.

277
00:16:38,314 --> 00:16:38,730
Rym: I don't know.

278
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:43,532
Rym: I think my personal favorite is still Q is for Q and Q reading Q just because it has a Recursion.

279
00:16:43,773 --> 00:16:48,130
Rym: recursion does add a lot to that one, you know, it's the classic picture of your cubicle.

280
00:16:48,231 --> 00:16:50,430
Rym: But in the picture is the picture of the cubicle.

281
00:16:51,133 --> 00:16:55,190
Scott: I like the art the best on the Tintin one because it actually looks like Tintin art.

282
00:16:55,311 --> 00:16:57,750
Scott: It's Tintin and a Time Lord taking tea in Tibet.

283
00:16:58,631 --> 00:17:04,954
Rym: But if I had to pick a favorite one, I don't know that evolving emu is pretty funny just for the way It's kind of laughing.

284
00:17:05,255 --> 00:17:06,319
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty good.

285
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:09,210
Rym: a little bit of Psyduck with a little bit of Howard the Duck.

286
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:14,130
Scott: Yeah Picking a favorite like none of them like they're all pretty awesome.

287
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:18,950
Scott: But I don't I can't find one that's like the awesomest like way up above the other ones.

288
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:21,969
Scott: I guess this Optimus Prime obliterating Oompa Loompas is pretty good.

289
00:17:23,571 --> 00:17:24,377
Scott: Yeah, whatever.

290
00:17:24,396 --> 00:17:26,329
Scott: This is a totally awesome nerdy alphabet.

291
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:31,750
Scott: And if you want to see Galactus geeking out with his glove puppets of Gundam and Godzilla, you should go to this website.

292
00:17:33,192 --> 00:17:35,710
Rym: But all that aside we kind of talked about a lot of non mocha.

293
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:45,490
Rym: So I suppose we should just talk about the mocha or at least the art festival Not the museum that we've never really talked about saying art festivals redundant because the last a and mocha is art.

294
00:17:45,611 --> 00:17:51,109
Scott: so it's like if you say mocha art festival, you're actually saying Museum of comic and cartoon art.

295
00:17:52,678 --> 00:17:54,690
Rym: If I say just mocha festival it might be about coffee.

296
00:17:54,991 --> 00:18:00,347
Scott: No, the mocha festival is definitely the correct way to say it, but doesn't that not also refer to coffee?

297
00:18:00,408 --> 00:18:00,648
Rym: or perhaps?

298
00:18:00,688 --> 00:18:06,281
Scott: no There isn't a mocha festival with an H in it, it doesn't exist.

299
00:18:06,662 --> 00:18:18,100
Rym: maybe we should pronounce one of the C's different like No or draw anyway, ha ha so you might have noticed much like before when we had guest host Conrad Crayley Why do you keep insisting on this guest host business?

300
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,045
Rym: talk about cell phones?

301
00:18:19,145 --> 00:18:20,170
Rym: We have it yet again.

302
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:22,030
Rym: We're gonna try to make this a trend at least for a while.

303
00:18:22,371 --> 00:18:27,489
Emily: We have the right honorable Emily Compton because it's so rare that I'm in this room with you guys.

304
00:18:27,851 --> 00:18:29,378
Rym: She's usually the studio audience.

305
00:18:29,418 --> 00:18:31,969
Rym: She's been a guest in the past a guest host in the past.

306
00:18:32,191 --> 00:18:34,550
Scott: Well, see, uh, let's see even you your fail.

307
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:37,224
Scott: It's not a guest host unless they are hosting.

308
00:18:37,285 --> 00:18:40,037
Scott: just give up on it Just like you give up on your stupid guess.

309
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,526
Scott: that's pride and all that other stupid shit you keep doing.

310
00:18:42,707 --> 00:18:43,570
Rym: my hilarious sticks.

311
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:46,630
Scott: Yeah, you're non hilarious repetitive annoying sticks.

312
00:18:51,391 --> 00:18:52,113
Scott: It's not me it's.

313
00:18:52,334 --> 00:18:53,798
Scott: nobody likes these takes.

314
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,330
Rym: I will point out that for everyone other than you that's pride.

315
00:18:57,792 --> 00:18:58,474
Rym: It's not a stick.

316
00:18:58,514 --> 00:18:59,417
Rym: That's a one-off joke.

317
00:18:59,437 --> 00:18:59,899
Rym: That's hilarious.

318
00:18:59,959 --> 00:19:03,070
Emily: No, I see it every time and I'm like, it's coming.

319
00:19:03,293 --> 00:19:04,450
Emily: You guys know it's coming.

320
00:19:05,431 --> 00:19:09,217
Rym: When I was anime Boston guys sitting to my left He did not see it coming.

321
00:19:09,237 --> 00:19:12,254
Rym: when I said, I guess that's pride you left You know what.

322
00:19:12,314 --> 00:19:13,540
Scott: for now on every time we do that.

323
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,454
Scott: I'm gonna be like, oh, I guess you're Greg Hartman And you know what?

324
00:19:16,574 --> 00:19:18,001
Rym: No one else is gonna know what that means.

325
00:19:18,121 --> 00:19:18,925
Scott: It doesn't matter.

326
00:19:18,965 --> 00:19:19,930
Scott: You'll know what it means.

327
00:19:20,794 --> 00:19:23,310
Scott: It should make you you'll feel bad and you should feel bad.

328
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:34,930
Emily: There was this chart about dweebs and geeks and nerds and stuff like that And one of the things for being a dweeb was that you go around repeating the same joke over and over to different people.

329
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:39,407
Rym: So you are point out is that not also what someone like George Carlin does?

330
00:19:39,507 --> 00:19:40,130
Rym: he tells the same?

331
00:19:41,272 --> 00:19:44,279
Emily: About it and you can see it and it's like record.

332
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:45,603
Scott: He wrote the joke.

333
00:19:45,683 --> 00:19:50,438
Emily: Yeah, he's not pretending he's being like Original every time.

334
00:19:50,598 --> 00:19:50,719
Emily: it's.

335
00:19:50,859 --> 00:19:58,410
Rym: it's like yeah, this is like it's a performance Like old Jews telling jokes, it's not any telling of a joke or performance.

336
00:19:58,692 --> 00:20:01,610
Rym: So what if you happen to tell the same joke multiple times in the course of your life?

337
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:05,606
Emily: Well, I guess you're part of it is you're pretending.

338
00:20:05,626 --> 00:20:08,156
Emily: when you tell the joke It's like a one-off performance.

339
00:20:08,217 --> 00:20:10,285
Emily: Like I am performing just for you.

340
00:20:10,345 --> 00:20:15,816
Emily: And this is an original joke I thought up because I am so witty but It's just.

341
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:17,403
Scott: I think it's simpler than that.

342
00:20:17,624 --> 00:20:18,830
Scott: your joke isn't funny.

343
00:20:19,971 --> 00:20:21,999
Scott: George Carlin is funny every time.

344
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:22,823
Scott: I think the pride.

345
00:20:22,863 --> 00:20:24,730
Scott: you are funny zero times.

346
00:20:24,811 --> 00:20:27,150
Scott: It wasn't funny the first time or any time thereafter.

347
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:40,441
Scott: The point is is that we are not Guest hosts unless we are not here is just guest.

348
00:20:40,842 --> 00:20:43,690
Rym: All right, I might get some backup arguments later.

349
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:50,243
Scott: I don't think anyone will agree with you that someone is a guest host unless We are not here and they are taking up the duties of hosting.

350
00:20:50,263 --> 00:20:53,908
Scott: if they're just on the show with us They're only a guest and not a guest host.

351
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:54,412
Rym: But if what?

352
00:20:54,432 --> 00:20:55,255
Rym: if they're hosting with us?

353
00:20:55,557 --> 00:20:59,055
Scott: if someone sits next to Letterman those that's not a guest host as a guest We'll see.

354
00:20:59,075 --> 00:21:00,950
Scott: if Letterman is letterman is sick at home.

355
00:21:03,055 --> 00:21:07,750
Emily: Okay, so GeekNights is like an apartment that you guys share.

356
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:13,809
Emily: It's like having a guest host would be like putting somebody's name on the lease or having them sublet.

357
00:21:17,592 --> 00:21:27,170
Emily: So anyway the mocha the mocha art festival it was Festival and not boiling hot like it was last year, which was very very nice.

358
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:29,826
Scott: Yeah, I have to give credit to the to the people running it right?

359
00:21:29,906 --> 00:21:30,530
Scott: It's like okay.

360
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:34,250
Scott: They were in the puck building not so good because it's cramped with the multiple rooms.

361
00:21:34,792 --> 00:21:36,098
Emily: Crazy old elevator.

362
00:21:36,118 --> 00:21:37,262
Emily: you go up in the creaky.

363
00:21:37,303 --> 00:21:43,444
Scott: I mean, it really wasn't it wasn't ideal Yeah, so they moved to the armory which was you know cheap.

364
00:21:43,925 --> 00:21:45,350
Scott: right because they don't have a lot of monies.

365
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,232
Scott: You know, it's mostly.

366
00:21:46,293 --> 00:21:49,582
Scott: this is where the mocha museum gets all its fundraising from.

367
00:21:49,723 --> 00:21:53,174
Scott: is, you know, the armory selling ammo Right.

368
00:21:53,295 --> 00:21:59,570
Scott: So, you know they had it in the armory Which is this big empty room that they do like drills and usually when it's not being used for festivals.

369
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:04,661
Emily: There were actually some On-duty soldiers walking around on the second floor.

370
00:22:04,681 --> 00:22:05,303
Scott: It's an armory.

371
00:22:05,344 --> 00:22:05,785
Scott: It's real.

372
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:06,347
Scott: It's in use.

373
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:07,070
Scott: There's arms there.

374
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:10,790
Rym: Yeah, it's the real deal, but it was funny how many people at the mocha just had no idea.

375
00:22:10,891 --> 00:22:11,598
Rym: That's what was going on.

376
00:22:11,638 --> 00:22:28,550
Emily: Like that's what the building was Because it's got all these signs and it's like US Army and they've got a list of people who passed away in wars Says like operation, you know Iraqi freedom and stuff on some of this it is really old.

377
00:22:29,714 --> 00:22:34,130
Rym: That sort of thing they don't look at like a building like that and just think about modern military.

378
00:22:34,251 --> 00:22:36,170
Rym: They think of it as like a relic something old.

379
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:36,431
Rym: They don't.

380
00:22:36,732 --> 00:22:42,650
Rym: no one really considers their daily life that all those things are kind of real and that we do saw that stuff Just kind of next door in the building.

381
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:48,406
Emily: But the thing is I mean the Chrysler buildings damn old but like modern day businesses are still in that.

382
00:22:48,566 --> 00:22:51,094
Emily: how is a military Building any different?

383
00:22:51,697 --> 00:22:55,010
Rym: Well, just because people don't think about military stuff like that in their daily lives.

384
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,840
Rym: Anyway, this is this is completely tangential.

385
00:22:59,792 --> 00:23:01,802
Scott: The point is is that you know, they had it.

386
00:23:02,003 --> 00:23:08,650
Scott: they moved it to this armory But they didn't change the time of year and the result was that the armory had really no air conditioning.

387
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:11,063
Scott: It was like an a zillion degrees last year.

388
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:12,209
Emily: Is this big?

389
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:20,310
Emily: You know metal dome and it had the worst fanboy funk, but the thing is there were no fanboys there.

390
00:23:20,451 --> 00:23:21,705
Emily: It was just that hot.

391
00:23:21,907 --> 00:23:36,990
Scott: Yep So all credit to them because I would have tried to find another place, you know And I wouldn't have found one because there aren't any and all credit to the people at the the mocha for coming up with the idea Of hey Let's just move it to a different time of year in the same building when it's not a million.

392
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:40,965
Rym: They got really lucky because I note that the entire week up until the mocha.

393
00:23:41,306 --> 00:23:44,767
Rym: It was like 80 degrees Couple days.

394
00:23:47,495 --> 00:23:48,201
Scott: I think it's pretty.

395
00:23:48,222 --> 00:23:56,052
Scott: it was a pretty safe Safe-go plus it, you know, it wasn't as warm as it was for the last year not even close It was.

396
00:23:56,233 --> 00:23:58,723
Emily: it was like incredibly pleasant weather that day.

397
00:23:58,744 --> 00:24:00,210
Emily: It was nice and brisk.

398
00:24:01,332 --> 00:24:01,813
Scott: It's very good.

399
00:24:02,395 --> 00:24:12,750
Emily: Anyway, so in terms of my policy like every time I go to mocha It's kind of like I'm overwhelmed by the amount of things that I want to buy.

400
00:24:13,273 --> 00:24:16,150
Emily: So I figured I'm gonna take out a certain amount of money.

401
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:25,590
Emily: It took out $100 and I wasn't gonna spend more than that which is a sizable sum, but I also figured you know They have a lot of publishers there.

402
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:31,049
Emily: They're indie publishers, but they're pretty big like like top shelf or vertical and stuff like that.

403
00:24:31,671 --> 00:24:35,624
Emily: And so I said to myself if there's something I can get online.

404
00:24:36,046 --> 00:24:39,090
Emily: I'm not gonna buy it at the festival I might buy it later online.

405
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:43,686
Emily: But it's like this this money is just set aside for any comics and special things.

406
00:24:43,746 --> 00:24:44,589
Emily: I can only get here.

407
00:24:45,091 --> 00:24:50,070
Scott: Well, the you know, I totally agree with that like, you know, it's obvious sort of logic that I would normally follow.

408
00:24:50,171 --> 00:24:50,633
Scott: You know, it's like.

409
00:24:50,955 --> 00:24:52,766
Scott: why should I buy this book from top shelf?

410
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:57,810
Scott: It's on Amazon You know like buying a funny mini comic about lumberjacks, you ain't getting that anywhere else, right?

411
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,243
Scott: But you know a book from a real publisher.

412
00:25:00,304 --> 00:25:01,230
Scott: you can get that anytime.

413
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:06,850
Scott: The thing is the people are there if the person's there right and it's not like, you know autographs.

414
00:25:06,991 --> 00:25:09,229
Scott: I don't really care so much about autographs, you know.

415
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,595
Scott: But it's like need to talk to.

416
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:13,969
Scott: it's like the person's there and it's like what I'm gonna go up and talk to the person.

417
00:25:14,891 --> 00:25:15,213
Scott: Wrote the.

418
00:25:15,273 --> 00:25:18,350
Scott: we made the book that I like and then I'm not gonna buy it, you know.

419
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:18,892
Scott: So it's like.

420
00:25:18,932 --> 00:25:21,541
Scott: well, you know I can go do it's like.

421
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:22,545
Scott: I could go and buy.

422
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:24,772
Scott: I had if I could go and buy The newest dr.

423
00:25:24,793 --> 00:25:34,226
Scott: McNinja volume, you know from you know, the Internet's or I could go buy it from the dr McNinja guy who's there right now and it's you know, it's to pay to co either way.

424
00:25:34,286 --> 00:25:35,110
Scott: So what's the difference?

425
00:25:35,331 --> 00:25:36,020
Emily: I'm gonna buy.

426
00:25:36,081 --> 00:25:43,045
Rym: definitely All you have to do is you know, you talk to him and be like hey So, you know I already bought your book on to pay to go.

427
00:25:43,205 --> 00:25:48,225
Emily: but that's a lie Rym, if we hadn't already bought the book, it would be terrible.

428
00:25:48,245 --> 00:25:49,430
Rym: You haven't already bought it.

429
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:53,817
Rym: But if you pre-order everything or you get it on to pay to co that's true Like if you got a pre-order in.

430
00:25:53,857 --> 00:25:56,710
Scott: but the point if it's like the same price, it's like what you know, who cares?

431
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:58,189
Emily: Well, it's like Hope Larson's book.

432
00:25:58,391 --> 00:26:01,210
Emily: She it's sold on Amazon and everything.

433
00:26:01,371 --> 00:26:06,432
Emily: But it was cool to buy it directly from her and talk to her Briefly.

434
00:26:06,513 --> 00:26:10,970
Rym: the person reason I bought it from her in person was that a lot of people were saying that it's gonna sell out.

435
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:12,076
Rym: There's gonna be another print run.

436
00:26:12,256 --> 00:26:14,890
Scott: That's that's also a quite frequent possibility.

437
00:26:15,011 --> 00:26:16,538
Scott: Another thing is that the person who makes it.

438
00:26:16,638 --> 00:26:19,089
Scott: usually when you buy it from them at the they get a lot more monies.

439
00:26:19,713 --> 00:26:23,053
Scott: Then you know if you buy it on Amazon, it's like oh, yeah Amazon takes a cut

440
00:26:23,334 --> 00:26:24,297
Emily: the publisher

441
00:26:24,317 --> 00:26:32,365
Scott: takes a cut and the person who wrote made it got a royalty if you buy it from them At the convention, it's like they get a lot greater percentage of money.

442
00:26:32,385 --> 00:26:39,585
Rym: I didn't realize that This funny feeling that several of them do not in fact pay the duly owed sales taxes.

443
00:26:40,086 --> 00:26:40,247
Scott: Yep.

444
00:26:40,347 --> 00:26:40,989
Scott: Most likely.

445
00:26:41,029 --> 00:26:43,138
Rym: Yes I have that impression.

446
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:45,590
Emily: Yeah, probably some of the mini comics.

447
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:51,850
Emily: But actually I was happy to see that the Scandinavian comics had actually expanded this year.

448
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:54,344
Scott: I think they were more like three or four years in a row.

449
00:26:54,405 --> 00:26:58,288
Emily: Yeah, but I Know they had more than one table.

450
00:27:00,114 --> 00:27:05,687
Emily: It started with two it started with two like two years ago and then it's gradually expanded.

451
00:27:05,807 --> 00:27:10,198
Emily: and I think this year there were More comics than ever before.

452
00:27:10,238 --> 00:27:21,580
Emily: and I actually a shout out to our friend Timo Because he sent us a box of comics which I've read most of them and you guys haven't so nag nag, but He sent this one.

453
00:27:21,661 --> 00:27:26,350
Emily: I don't even remember the name of it But it's about these two girls who live in a cabin and it's kind of funny.

454
00:27:26,652 --> 00:27:27,518
Rym: I had no idea either.

455
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:36,529
Emily: I still thought it was it was cute and there was like goofy stuff going on like somebody fart in a bottle.

456
00:27:38,591 --> 00:27:41,764
Emily: But I was like, you know, I saw this is it?

457
00:27:41,804 --> 00:27:46,766
Scott: well, I guess they call it a Dutch oven Right when you fart under the blanket, so is that like a Dutch bottle?

458
00:27:47,007 --> 00:27:47,530
Emily: I guess so.

459
00:27:49,773 --> 00:27:58,506
Emily: The point being I recognize this comic book character on one of the The Finnish comics tables postcards and I was like, oh I know this comic.

460
00:27:58,546 --> 00:28:04,094
Emily: my friend sent it to me And it's really cool and I was talking to the lady and they were like really really surprised I knew it.

461
00:28:04,195 --> 00:28:04,678
Emily: So I was.

462
00:28:04,778 --> 00:28:06,046
Emily: I was very proud of myself.

463
00:28:06,187 --> 00:28:11,068
Scott: Yay but That you coincidentally saw something.

464
00:28:11,088 --> 00:28:17,650
Emily: Yeah Well, you know that I that I actually had something to talk about common knowledge with Finnish comics.

465
00:28:17,791 --> 00:28:18,856
Emily: That was that was part of it.

466
00:28:18,896 --> 00:28:19,600
Emily: I was like, yay.

467
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,369
Emily: I knew something about Finnish comics.

468
00:28:22,911 --> 00:28:26,243
Scott: It's like if you're a comics person any random person who's walking around.

469
00:28:26,283 --> 00:28:28,210
Scott: it's like, oh, yeah, we all know these same things.

470
00:28:28,471 --> 00:28:29,273
Emily: Yeah, it was.

471
00:28:29,554 --> 00:28:35,010
Emily: it was cool and I talked to like one of the guys from Sweden for a really long time.

472
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:40,730
Emily: But I felt really bad for him because most of his books got lost by UPS in international shipping.

473
00:28:41,191 --> 00:28:47,250
Emily: So he he drew like this picture of him and his friend and they were all sad because we have no books.

474
00:28:47,531 --> 00:28:59,449
Emily: and but he was also showing me this Quarterly publication that has all sorts of international comics in it that that the Scandinavian consulates seem to be involved in.

475
00:29:00,213 --> 00:29:01,579
Rym: Because there was another situation.

476
00:29:01,619 --> 00:29:11,868
Rym: apparently some of the people coming from Canada they were on a bus and the bus got stopped for customs and customs almost took all their books because they wanted to get him on some import tax that they didn't know.

477
00:29:11,888 --> 00:29:12,069
Scott: shit.

478
00:29:12,089 --> 00:29:18,932
Rym: and the sad story I was told was that apparently customs like made a big deal about it and delayed the bus for like an hour and Was mad.

479
00:29:18,952 --> 00:29:19,835
Rym: and this huge problem.

480
00:29:20,477 --> 00:29:25,502
Rym: and then they finally like they flipped through one of the books and they look disappointed like oh these Aren't professional.

481
00:29:25,543 --> 00:29:29,936
Rym: and then they gave him back Sad story I'd ever heard.

482
00:29:29,956 --> 00:29:32,986
Emily: that is not the ending I was expecting for that.

483
00:29:33,266 --> 00:29:34,129
Emily: Oh, that's so sad.

484
00:29:34,935 --> 00:29:36,690
Rym: That was incredibly heartbreaking.

485
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,533
Emily: I thought it was gonna end with.

486
00:29:38,713 --> 00:29:40,496
Emily: oh it had porn in it or something.

487
00:29:40,536 --> 00:29:46,105
Emily: because actually there's a surprising amount of like Strangely erotic comics.

488
00:29:46,205 --> 00:29:46,666
Emily: not like.

489
00:29:46,967 --> 00:29:48,271
Emily: they're not sexy sexy.

490
00:29:48,311 --> 00:29:55,431
Rym: They're just like penis head guy In an r-crumb kind of exactly.

491
00:29:55,451 --> 00:29:56,154
Emily: that's a.

492
00:29:56,174 --> 00:29:57,620
Rym: that's a wonderful way to put it.

493
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,305
Rym: It's very like.

494
00:29:58,406 --> 00:29:59,939
Scott: I don't even know if a lot of them are erotic.

495
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:11,079
Scott: They just happen that they have nakedness the way like, you know old art has no Very very weird like there's a palace coming out of this.

496
00:30:11,605 --> 00:30:12,640
Scott: Is that erotic for you?

497
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,041
Emily: But it's it's like.

498
00:30:14,081 --> 00:30:17,024
Emily: I suppose it sends it like draws a lot of depictions of genitalia.

499
00:30:17,064 --> 00:30:27,947
Emily: it's it's Erotic art in the very least.

500
00:30:27,987 --> 00:30:31,279
Rym: there are many many more penis related items than there were.

501
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:32,663
Scott: vagina I don't know personally.

502
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:39,860
Scott: I don't count, you know, just because something has a depiction of a of a phallus or something else You know in my book that doesn't make it erotic.

503
00:30:40,101 --> 00:30:43,153
Scott: I mean is my is this day, you know, is the statue of David?

504
00:30:43,214 --> 00:30:43,917
Scott: is that erotic?

505
00:30:43,957 --> 00:30:44,720
Scott: It's got a penis.

506
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:48,073
Rym: So what if the David was using his penis to bop people over the head?

507
00:30:48,756 --> 00:30:49,760
Scott: That would just be funny.

508
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:55,211
Rym: My mission to anyone out there is to have that.

509
00:30:55,351 --> 00:30:57,398
Scott: at the mocha someone someone draw a picture of.

510
00:30:57,458 --> 00:31:00,263
Scott: you know 24 hour come.

511
00:31:00,303 --> 00:31:09,307
Scott: okay 24 hour comics at the mocha Like a new hot thing to do.

512
00:31:09,327 --> 00:31:13,442
Scott: it's like people go to like comic stores when they're having big sales or what, you know Whatever.

513
00:31:13,462 --> 00:31:15,260
Scott: There's a like a local comic event.

514
00:31:15,481 --> 00:31:21,888
Scott: Yeah, they'll get some artists to show up and do a 24-hour comic at the event and then you know That's like the stick lately, but it's like I.

515
00:31:22,049 --> 00:31:24,939
Emily: I picked up a handful and a lot of them were written on it.

516
00:31:25,201 --> 00:31:34,919
Scott: It said, you know, this was done as a 24-hour And I think the 24-hour comic day also like the day you're supposed to do it And then all the artists who do it they keep the 24-hour comic and then they sell it.

517
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:39,960
Emily: You know over and over again like yuko does it and a handful of my art friends do it.

518
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:43,493
Emily: So yeah, it's it's like a yearly thing, but it it also.

519
00:31:43,593 --> 00:31:44,978
Emily: you can do it whenever it's like the.

520
00:31:45,139 --> 00:31:52,317
Scott: you know The the NaNoWriMo, it's like it's the same kind of stick but less Intensive than the NaNoWriMo.

521
00:31:52,498 --> 00:32:02,740
Scott: Yeah So so the mocha I guess this year compared to last year, you know two years previous It was I think they were actually it was smaller in terms of number of tables.

522
00:32:03,202 --> 00:32:07,180
Scott: The turnout in terms of you know, visitors seemed to be about the same, you know.

523
00:32:07,281 --> 00:32:09,552
Scott: But the you know The number of tables was less.

524
00:32:09,592 --> 00:32:14,558
Scott: in the back right corner There was actually an area with all these like tall circular tables kind of a hangout zone.

525
00:32:14,598 --> 00:32:17,006
Rym: Yeah Various business cards like that.

526
00:32:17,146 --> 00:32:22,000
Emily: It's like then somebody who couldn't afford a table would just put their put their business card.

527
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,474
Scott: I think people who had tables also put their business cards on there, you know, yeah But you know, it was just.

528
00:32:26,657 --> 00:32:30,320
Scott: you know They had as they always have an area where you can put flyers at the mocha.

529
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:36,635
Scott: But you know having it back there it's like well we didn't sell enough tables to fill this space So let's fill it with this instead.

530
00:32:36,675 --> 00:32:38,228
Scott: and that was you know It made a nice area.

531
00:32:38,268 --> 00:32:39,316
Scott: you could just stand in and go.

532
00:32:39,538 --> 00:32:49,182
Rym: ah But while the side like there were definitely I think fewer tables and everything The density of awesome was such that usually I budget like a few hours and I can walk through the whole thing see everything be Good to go.

533
00:32:49,202 --> 00:32:50,591
Scott: Yeah, it was weird ever man.

534
00:32:50,731 --> 00:32:52,200
Scott: I didn't like I didn't eat breakfast.

535
00:32:52,382 --> 00:32:53,717
Scott: Well, I ate a little bit of breakfast.

536
00:32:53,737 --> 00:32:57,292
Emily: barely I had a chunk of rims corn muffin and that's all I ate.

537
00:32:57,352 --> 00:33:06,700
Scott: right because I was expecting to like go to the mocha See a whole bunch of stuff eat lunch Maybe go back for an hour and then be like, all right, whatever and be out of there like, you know mid-afternoon.

538
00:33:06,961 --> 00:33:10,340
Rym: So usually usually through barely an aisle and a half

539
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:19,865
Scott: Yeah Usually you go to the mocha you see everything and then you've seen it all and then you walk around again like sort of cursor Lee and You know, it's like okay

540
00:33:19,905 --> 00:33:27,157
Rym: my two hours of walking and I know I was not even halfway through like all the like all the I also wanted to see a bump through enough and I'm like, hey, how does it go?

541
00:33:27,177 --> 00:33:28,659
Rym: And he's like man It's like molasses.

542
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:36,156
Scott: Yeah, so this year the quality was definitely way way way up.

543
00:33:36,496 --> 00:33:37,940
Emily: yeah, actually it was funny.

544
00:33:38,482 --> 00:33:43,187
Emily: I convinced one of my co-workers to go and He he was.

545
00:33:43,489 --> 00:33:51,780
Emily: I'm not sure if he's so much an indie comic person He doesn't know much about comic books But he went to check it out and he was like there are a lot of illustrators there that were kind of cool and everything.

546
00:33:51,941 --> 00:33:52,927
Emily: So I was happy.

547
00:33:52,987 --> 00:33:56,404
Emily: I was like, maybe he'll get into it But I don't see.

548
00:33:56,444 --> 00:34:01,620
Scott: you know, if you're a human being who enjoys any amount of arts there is something for you.

549
00:34:01,861 --> 00:34:03,026
Scott: You know, there's no reason not to go.

550
00:34:03,086 --> 00:34:03,689
Scott: It's so cheap.

551
00:34:03,729 --> 00:34:06,100
Scott: It's like what 10 bucks to get in 14 bucks?

552
00:34:06,281 --> 00:34:09,739
Rym: Well, no, no, it's about $400 to get in because you're gonna have to buy all that stuff.

553
00:34:10,342 --> 00:34:12,110
Scott: No, but you know the point way to avoid that.

554
00:34:12,311 --> 00:34:14,520
Scott: the point is is it just it's cheap to get a badge?

555
00:34:14,681 --> 00:34:16,317
Scott: You know you just go in it's.

556
00:34:16,458 --> 00:34:24,040
Scott: you know It takes only a few hours and it's just like it's such a good time if you're anywhere within distance There's no reason not to go unless you got something better going on.

557
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:38,820
Emily: There's just a really really wide range of both the skill levels like everything from the guy who just photocopies his own stuff all the way up to like the glossy bound Hardcover books from the big publishers, but it's like what did we see we saw?

558
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:49,226
Emily: $125 enormous full-color book And stuff like that.

559
00:34:49,266 --> 00:34:50,971
Emily: a bunch a bunch of artists.

560
00:34:50,991 --> 00:34:53,540
Rym: there were a lot of hardcover books from very small press.

561
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,750
Rym: I think there's suddenly a cheap way to make hardcover.

562
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:57,077
Emily: Well must be cuz.

563
00:34:57,318 --> 00:35:01,253
Emily: uh Kalman I ran into the guy who used to run.

564
00:35:01,273 --> 00:35:09,220
Emily: He's like a nerdy guy who ran D&D for us freshman year of college and he's he's very loud and kind of bossy.

565
00:35:09,681 --> 00:35:15,880
Emily: but he's been doing a comic with this artist from Argentina or something like that and he had a bunch of hardcover books for sale.

566
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:19,846
Emily: and I know if Kalman's still pretty indie.

567
00:35:20,007 --> 00:35:24,500
Emily: So if he could afford hardcover books, I guess it's not so much of a money drain.

568
00:35:24,961 --> 00:35:29,917
Rym: So things that really stood out to me in no particular at all one diary of Diaries.

569
00:35:29,957 --> 00:35:36,178
Rym: the trilogy has ended three years and I'm sad to say it has come to an end.

570
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:37,843
Rym: But the quote from the.

571
00:35:37,863 --> 00:35:42,837
Rym: I'm gonna read the quote from the last page because it sums up the whole epic story arc.

572
00:35:43,822 --> 00:35:51,019
Rym: So in closing let me leave you with this when a hard winds a-blowing take heed and realize the storm she's a-coming.

573
00:35:55,661 --> 00:35:57,349
Scott: So, let's see, what else is it?

574
00:35:57,489 --> 00:36:03,600
Scott: Oh the like the SVA and the Center for cartoon studies.

575
00:36:05,182 --> 00:36:15,640
Scott: So many tables of people who are from one of those two schools Might have even been approaching like 25 or even maybe maximum like 35 percent of the table.

576
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:22,180
Emily: Of course, there are people from those places who reasons I think that this is is one SBA is really close.

577
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:26,940
Scott: So it's like you have a Center for cartoon studies in Vermont and they had a whole row of tables in the back.

578
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,814
Emily: Very true, but like SVA has always been there.

579
00:36:29,894 --> 00:36:36,035
Emily: Like I remember the first Yeah, the first time I went to the mocha they had just the one table.

580
00:36:36,115 --> 00:36:49,360
Emily: like SVA take her free compilation of student work and this is really cool, but it's like You know people who weren't necessarily affiliated with the SVA table, but were SVA students.

581
00:36:49,842 --> 00:36:55,085
Emily: there were a ton of folks like that mmm and Late lately.

582
00:36:55,105 --> 00:36:56,794
Emily: I've just been like Oh SVA.

583
00:36:56,854 --> 00:36:57,779
Emily: Why are you so good?

584
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,125
Scott: There must I wonder like.

585
00:37:00,668 --> 00:37:07,988
Scott: maybe if like even someone who has no arts whatsoever goes to that school Like they just turn you into awesome arts How much does it cost to go there?

586
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:09,092
Emily: Lots of money.

587
00:37:09,132 --> 00:37:10,096
Emily: It's a private school.

588
00:37:10,156 --> 00:37:13,494
Emily: Not as much as NYU But not as well, I mean RIT is a private school.

589
00:37:13,514 --> 00:37:14,399
Scott: Is it the same as RIT?

590
00:37:15,882 --> 00:37:22,883
Emily: I actually don't know what tuition for SVA costs, but they do have really good programs and I don't know.

591
00:37:23,244 --> 00:37:25,573
Emily: It's it's fairly difficult to get in.

592
00:37:25,633 --> 00:37:42,210
Emily: I think you have to have a decent portfolio If you're trying to get into art school In in place of an application essay and often in addition to the application I say you have to submit a portfolio and that's

593
00:37:42,491 --> 00:37:46,895
Scott: that's not like already college graduate and I'm old I don't know the high school anymore.

594
00:37:46,935 --> 00:37:47,600
Scott: I still have to do that.

595
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:54,632
Emily: You can look on the SVA website and see if you'd get accepted to one of their Anymore going back to college like FAFSA.

596
00:37:54,813 --> 00:37:55,900
Rym: I gotta find one of those things.

597
00:37:56,061 --> 00:37:58,355
Emily: It would be like that song from Avenue Q.

598
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:04,820
Rym: So I bought this for our friend Scott Johnson, you know He's.

599
00:38:04,961 --> 00:38:08,747
Rym: he's a politician like for real and he's really into politics independent of that.

600
00:38:09,187 --> 00:38:10,810
Rym: and he said I can't come to the mocha.

601
00:38:11,321 --> 00:38:12,829
Rym: I have something important that I can't skip.

602
00:38:13,371 --> 00:38:17,410
Rym: Rym buy me Anything that you know, I would like.

603
00:38:17,851 --> 00:38:19,960
Rym: and I found a guy who was selling.

00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:29,413
Rym: He has series one which I bought for Scott Johnson of black conservative trading cards Got some Clarence Thomas some Michael Steele Alan Keyes Condoleezza Rice.

605
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:30,857
Rym: He's silkscreen these things.

606
00:38:30,877 --> 00:38:32,020
Rym: They're pretty high quality.

607
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,787
Scott: Yeah, I know silkscreening is really popular.

608
00:38:33,807 --> 00:38:37,380
Scott: I bought this really awesome silkscreen motorcycle poster thing.

609
00:38:37,661 --> 00:38:40,980
Scott: They were only like 60 something of them, but the guy silkscreen all of them by hand.

610
00:38:41,281 --> 00:38:44,199
Rym: This is four color silkscreening - which is not easy to do.

611
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,765
Rym: I suppose you have a fancy machine.

612
00:38:45,966 --> 00:38:49,740
Emily: was that from the table with the cute girl whom whose brother made pixel art?

613
00:38:50,021 --> 00:38:50,905
Scott: Yeah in the back left.

614
00:38:50,985 --> 00:38:52,150
Emily: Yeah, she was nice.

615
00:38:52,431 --> 00:38:54,300
Rym: Although the black no that wasn't from there.

616
00:38:54,761 --> 00:38:57,732
Emily: No, no, the one I got the silkscreen of the motorcycle.

617
00:38:57,812 --> 00:38:59,237
Emily: I was all like art deco.

618
00:38:59,298 --> 00:38:59,960
Emily: That was really cool.

619
00:39:00,961 --> 00:39:06,151
Rym: A couple of people went to buy that thing because you had you showed it to him or said hey I got this thing and they were sold out.

620
00:39:06,312 --> 00:39:12,040
Scott: They were like, ooh Yeah, the I don't want to spend like too much time just going over like the list of things that we got.

621
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:17,170
Rym: We'll do a separate because I got to say this really stood out.

622
00:39:17,631 --> 00:39:20,299
Rym: someone wrote a play and just had it bound for sale.

623
00:39:20,701 --> 00:39:23,232
Rym: That's not a comic.

624
00:39:23,333 --> 00:39:24,840
Scott: he said there's a lot of stuff there.

625
00:39:26,061 --> 00:39:27,688
Rym: You're the first person to even look at this.

626
00:39:28,029 --> 00:39:35,486
Rym: It is called parens and when I showed it to our friend Conrad He said so what it's a play about lisp Nerds left.

627
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:36,815
Rym: Yes, no one else did.

628
00:39:36,956 --> 00:39:39,066
Rym: no But I'll play it.

629
00:39:39,166 --> 00:39:40,531
Rym: actually I'm excited about this.

630
00:39:40,571 --> 00:39:41,555
Rym: and the other non-comic.

631
00:39:41,575 --> 00:39:42,358
Rym: that was kind of strange.

632
00:39:42,438 --> 00:39:53,319
Rym: Scott Bateman took a public domain Horrible movie took just the audio from it and just Animated a movie using that as the audio track and I bought the DVD.

633
00:39:54,482 --> 00:40:02,992
Rym: It's an hour and ten minutes long and it says on the box 2009 71 minutes color mono Aspect ratio 133 bad acting.

634
00:40:03,012 --> 00:40:13,829
Scott: Yeah, that's one of the warnings You know, what's really interesting is that last year right Randall Monroe had like the big-ass line, you know, but this year He wasn't there, you know who had the biggest line.

635
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:15,980
Scott: He'd beaten had this gigantic line.

636
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:20,742
Scott: It was known as the beaten path Joke stealer.

637
00:40:21,003 --> 00:40:22,168
Scott: you stole it from someone else.

638
00:40:22,269 --> 00:40:22,449
Scott: Yeah.

639
00:40:22,489 --> 00:40:24,839
Scott: In fact, you stole it from the guy who runs the mocha, right?

640
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:29,234
Rym: I think he was either the head of the mocha mocha or the head of logistics.

641
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:30,843
Scott: It was like the festival He had.

642
00:40:30,863 --> 00:40:34,086
Scott: I had a fancy festival director Yeah, but it was funny.

643
00:40:34,147 --> 00:40:37,000
Rym: cuz we're standing in line to see Kate beaten and I hear the guy behind me.

644
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,454
Rym: You know Scott and Emily and the rest of the crew.

645
00:40:38,474 --> 00:40:39,080
Rym: They're all talking.

646
00:40:39,482 --> 00:40:44,160
Rym: I'm kind of half listening and he says well, I guess we're on the beaten path and his friends all left.

647
00:40:44,622 --> 00:40:50,132
Rym: So I just turned to Scott Emily and I said, well, I guess we're on the beaten path We hadn't heard.

648
00:40:50,294 --> 00:40:50,960
Emily: so we are like.

649
00:40:52,745 --> 00:40:55,416
Rym: I was like, I just totally stole your joke and he made all that laugh.

650
00:40:55,516 --> 00:40:56,279
Rym: and then they laughed.

651
00:40:57,423 --> 00:41:00,250
Rym: Yes, it was a good joke For you.

652
00:41:00,451 --> 00:41:01,759
Rym: Yeah, I should have told it to keep beating.

653
00:41:02,182 --> 00:41:03,106
Scott: Yeah, it was still.

654
00:41:03,146 --> 00:41:06,100
Scott: it was really interesting to see that she had this gigantic line.

655
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,276
Scott: I mean she was there last year, but we didn't see her like.

656
00:41:08,376 --> 00:41:13,300
Scott: we showed up But we noticed oh, this is her table and she wasn't there at the time and we never tried to see her again.

657
00:41:13,963 --> 00:41:21,260
Scott: But it was just like wow that you know, it's like I knew that you know She's pretty popular and her stuff is high-quality, but I didn't realize she was that popular.

658
00:41:21,441 --> 00:41:23,831
Scott: I know that that were that many, you know, like.

659
00:41:23,911 --> 00:41:25,036
Scott: more so like dr.

660
00:41:25,076 --> 00:41:26,100
Scott: Meningin dude is sitting there.

661
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:30,180
Scott: He's got like a person coming up to him every, you know, a few seconds or whatever, but he doesn't have a line.

662
00:41:30,581 --> 00:41:33,370
Scott: You know Wonder Marks in between Kate beaten and dr.

663
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:34,072
Scott: Meningin guy.

664
00:41:34,172 --> 00:41:34,393
Scott: What's it?

665
00:41:34,513 --> 00:41:35,677
Scott: What's that guy's name?

666
00:41:35,717 --> 00:41:40,269
Scott: Chris Hastings, I think And you know, so Dave Malki's the Wonder Mark guy.

667
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:42,960
Scott: he's got people coming up once in a while just chillin doing his thing.

668
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,097
Scott: He's there every year, right?

669
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:50,380
Scott: We discovered him because of the mocha in fact You know and he's got someone coming up every once in a while and then Kate beaten is there with his mob.

670
00:41:50,641 --> 00:42:01,260
Emily: Yeah, it's like really which is kind of awesome because you figure only a couple years ago She started out on live journal and it was one of those instances where there was no real self-promotion or anything.

671
00:42:01,441 --> 00:42:04,977
Emily: It's just kind of got mimetic Lee traded around and everybody.

672
00:42:05,278 --> 00:42:07,547
Emily: Oh my god You gotta check these comics out.

673
00:42:07,587 --> 00:42:08,250
Emily: They're hilarious.

674
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:10,880
Scott: I think it's the same phenomenon as xkcd, right?

675
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:17,985
Scott: It's like, you know your art which kind of art style you don't have, you know have or don't have It doesn't really matter.

676
00:42:18,066 --> 00:42:21,337
Scott: as long as it's you know, it's good and your writing is really.

677
00:42:21,478 --> 00:42:22,180
Scott: what is the winner?

678
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,003
Emily: Different?

679
00:42:24,043 --> 00:42:25,692
Scott: not that you know, her arts is amazing.

680
00:42:25,792 --> 00:42:27,280
Scott: That's you know, but that's besides the point.

681
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:38,342
Scott: It's like the style of the art really complements the kinds of job But it's like look, you know like the penny arcade art style can do just as well as the key beaten art style It does.

682
00:42:38,362 --> 00:42:42,728
Scott: you can do any style as long as your style You know the stick figure art style of xkcd.

683
00:42:42,789 --> 00:42:46,223
Scott: any style is good on the internets as long as you know You do it.

684
00:42:46,263 --> 00:42:51,377
Scott: Well and your writing has to be there, you know Itself from the pack.

685
00:42:51,982 --> 00:42:56,661
Scott: There are plenty of webcomics out there though that have like amazing like holy shit arts Like.

686
00:42:56,681 --> 00:43:05,812
Scott: they look like art books, but no one reads them and they don't have big lines at the conventions because the writing is not You know world-changing, you know as it is with the three comics.

687
00:43:05,852 --> 00:43:07,196
Scott: I've just mentioned and others.

688
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:13,489
Emily: so One of the tables I spent the most money at was Lucy measly's table.

689
00:43:13,529 --> 00:43:23,700
Emily: I think that's how you say your name, but Actually way back at the first mocha I went to I bought this funny little comic where a girl was talking to an apple and a snowman and a refrigerator.

690
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,754
Emily: It was really quirky and cute and I really liked the style.

691
00:43:27,895 --> 00:43:29,380
Emily: and then the next year I saw her again.

692
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,404
Emily: I was like, oh, yeah I bought your comic and I bought.

693
00:43:31,705 --> 00:43:34,212
Emily: she had a CD of ukulele songs and they were.

694
00:43:34,674 --> 00:43:39,211
Emily: they were really cute and happy and sometimes I would listen to them while I was doing chores and stuff.

695
00:43:39,753 --> 00:43:47,900
Emily: And so it was weird because pre-mocha Rym and Scott and I had gone to see the RIT hockey game at a sports bar.

696
00:43:48,101 --> 00:43:50,972
Emily: It was like an RIT alumni event and the car.

697
00:43:51,012 --> 00:43:56,191
Emily: I know it was so sad But the comic store was right next door.

698
00:43:56,492 --> 00:43:59,464
Emily: And so I was like, come on guys before we go to the subway Let's go comics.

699
00:43:59,484 --> 00:44:02,900
Emily: and they were all like no, but they were doing some sort of event there.

700
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,627
Emily: It was like a woman in comics event And she was there.

701
00:44:06,647 --> 00:44:09,263
Emily: I was like, oh I remember you from the mocha Are you gonna be there?

702
00:44:09,323 --> 00:44:13,280
Emily: and then I ran into her again at drink and draw like a lady and then again at the mocha.

703
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,349
Emily: So I was like, oh, I've totally got to buy your books.

704
00:44:15,469 --> 00:44:17,157
Emily: So I got two.

705
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:25,940
Emily: I got one that was a collection of all her old like Journal comics and stuff called radiator days and that one was really good.

706
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:30,769
Emily: There was like a very wide range of subject matter and styles in it And it was.

707
00:44:30,931 --> 00:44:39,955
Emily: it was kind of a bummer though Because it was something I would totally give to my mom except that there were like three pages of porn Right smack dab in the middle of the book.

708
00:44:39,995 --> 00:44:43,247
Emily: So it's like Situation really.

709
00:44:43,308 --> 00:44:45,220
Emily: it was like they were all individual stories.

710
00:44:45,361 --> 00:44:54,336
Emily: It's just one or two of the stories happened to be rated X, you know, and so it was like Give this to all sorts of people, but there's a little bit of porn it.

711
00:44:54,577 --> 00:44:54,999
Scott: How about that?

712
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:57,791
Emily: So you have to be okay with that sci-fi yaoi.

713
00:44:58,132 --> 00:45:04,319
Emily: Oh, I haven't read it yet You know, I picked up a card from it, but I was like sci-fi plus yaoi.

714
00:45:04,661 --> 00:45:06,994
Emily: Maybe this will be a good webcomic, but the art looked.

715
00:45:07,154 --> 00:45:08,099
Emily: the art looked very good.

716
00:45:08,522 --> 00:45:17,860
Emily: So I was like if if I am gonna read a yaoi That looked like the kind of yaoi that would be interesting to me because it looked like a sci-fi story with plot and good art.

717
00:45:18,062 --> 00:45:22,768
Scott: So I was like, hey You know if it was just sci-fi, I would read it.

718
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:23,591
Emily: Why?

719
00:45:23,732 --> 00:45:25,940
Emily: why does yaoi stop you from reading it Scott?

720
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:26,984
Scott: Why would I want to read?

721
00:45:27,044 --> 00:45:29,796
Scott: Yeah, but what if it's a really good story?

722
00:45:29,857 --> 00:45:30,580
Emily: What if it's okay?

723
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:31,343
Emily: What if it's not?

724
00:45:31,444 --> 00:45:33,072
Scott: yaoi is like definition?

725
00:45:33,233 --> 00:45:38,533
Emily: I know I was going Going and explaining but say it's not yaoi.

726
00:45:38,593 --> 00:45:42,286
Emily: say it's it's a homoerotic Sci-fi story.

727
00:45:42,828 --> 00:45:44,094
Emily: would would you not read it?

728
00:45:44,114 --> 00:45:45,520
Scott: Isn't that sanctuary?

729
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:53,469
Scott: Sanctuary is incredibly homoerotic.

730
00:45:53,509 --> 00:45:56,600
Scott: It's definitely a work of fiction because politics is never that awesome.

731
00:46:00,521 --> 00:46:03,535
Emily: Anyway, but I might give that a look and see.

732
00:46:03,635 --> 00:46:04,459
Emily: see how good it is.

733
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:19,347
Scott: So, you know what was interesting is I just realized, you know It was missing something that we've been checking out at the mocha for like two or three years in a row that dude who did the story about like the Chinese dude and Oh, yeah Poser that one.

734
00:46:19,508 --> 00:46:25,856
Scott: and then the year at same guy last year He did the the one with the animals, you know that escaped from like the circus or whatever.

735
00:46:26,057 --> 00:46:26,900
Rym: Yeah, I didn't see him.

736
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:27,831
Scott: yeah, he wasn't there.

737
00:46:27,851 --> 00:46:32,652
Scott: and Also vegetables guy the cute vegetables guy wasn't there either.

738
00:46:32,692 --> 00:46:33,534
Scott: his comic was great.

Scott: he didn't have a table or if he did I didn't see it.

770
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:53,767
Emily: I could you say no, even if the comic is bad I know and it was just 50 cents.

771
00:47:53,887 --> 00:47:55,915
Emily: You get a pretty decent mini comic.

772
00:47:55,975 --> 00:47:57,360
Emily: I got one called crazy lady.

773
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:58,408
Scott: That was a good one.

774
00:47:58,448 --> 00:48:03,932
Scott: I read that it was really good Jews not nearly as good really I didn't I?

775
00:48:04,112 --> 00:48:05,719
Emily: the title made you choose it though.

776
00:48:05,941 --> 00:48:07,369
Emily: Yeah, you had to get that one.

777
00:48:07,429 --> 00:48:09,240
Rym: But crazy lady was actually pretty damn good.

778
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:11,495
Emily: Yeah, it's just basically the story about.

779
00:48:11,838 --> 00:48:18,157
Emily: you know The the strange people that populate a neighborhood and this guy observing this lady who owes weights at the bus stop.

780
00:48:18,659 --> 00:48:18,799
Scott: Mm-hmm.

781
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:22,108
Emily: So there was also baba luba.

782
00:48:22,368 --> 00:48:29,144
Emily: That was a good one too little tiny mini comic like tiny in size about This.

783
00:48:29,565 --> 00:48:33,540
Emily: it's based on this lady's Russian grandma and she's very foul-mouthed.

784
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:36,976
Emily: It's like she reprimands pussies and tulips.

785
00:48:37,136 --> 00:48:40,252
Rym: No bad catch About a couple of those little things like a bored angel.

786
00:48:40,272 --> 00:48:41,800
Rym: It's just a bored angel for a few pages.

787
00:48:42,001 --> 00:48:45,340
Emily: Yeah, they're just tiny tiny comics with no real plot.

788
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:49,859
Rym: It's just you know funny little picture lumberjacks which came with a felt beard in it.

789
00:48:50,241 --> 00:48:56,717
Scott: It's always funny how like the prices can like vary between Tables like there's no like standard price for a mini comic and it's almost like.

790
00:48:56,737 --> 00:48:58,961
Scott: you know You'll see something like way awesome Like.

791
00:48:59,001 --> 00:49:03,480
Scott: I bought this one way awesome thing called hobby and it's just the art style of it is like totally sweet.

792
00:49:03,902 --> 00:49:06,475
Scott: But it's it, you know, it's a it's a relatively mini comic.

793
00:49:06,515 --> 00:49:13,909
Scott: It's not the ultra mini It's just sort of like, you know, the digest dish size and it's only like ten or so pages But it's full color and it's really hard paper.

794
00:49:13,929 --> 00:49:16,700
Scott: and the guy was like seven bucks and I was like, ah, really?

795
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:24,059
Scott: But I bought it anyway, but you know, it's like the other dude is like 50 cents for this, you know more You know for crazy lady, it's like come on.

796
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:25,625
Rym: but those are the things I really look for.

797
00:49:25,645 --> 00:49:31,507
Rym: because the stuff that like someone hand-bound themselves and stapled together and that they clearly Printed it at a Kinko's equivalent.

798
00:49:31,728 --> 00:49:32,149
Rym: Yeah.

799
00:49:32,189 --> 00:49:34,919
Rym: Yeah, because that's the stuff you're never gonna find anywhere else except at the mocha.

800
00:49:35,644 --> 00:49:36,872
Emily: That's so is exciting.

801
00:49:37,596 --> 00:49:54,471
Emily: and I I have to mention here's another one which the art wasn't all that great But for the price it got us like a great amount of laughs which was like poor poor angsty Hungarian and the poor poor angsty Hungarian.

802
00:49:54,792 --> 00:49:59,225
Emily: was this story about this prince who gets Chased out of the castle?

803
00:49:59,385 --> 00:49:59,866
Emily: it there's.

804
00:50:00,267 --> 00:50:08,896
Emily: basically it was just random and it was weird and it would be like and that's Weathers whales in Lake, Ontario and and it's like aren't?

805
00:50:09,298 --> 00:50:09,660
Emily: I know?

806
00:50:10,282 --> 00:50:11,245
Emily: That's the whole point.

807
00:50:11,345 --> 00:50:12,810
Emily: It was just random.

808
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:13,432
Emily: shit would happen.

809
00:50:13,472 --> 00:50:19,825
Emily: and there was like the Hungarian prince and the Moldovan prince and they go around and have these inference.

810
00:50:20,165 --> 00:50:21,487
Emily: Are you yeah.

811
00:50:21,728 --> 00:50:23,270
Emily: Oh, no, then you should be vegetarian.

812
00:50:24,585 --> 00:50:26,720
Emily: You needed to have soy and and stuff.

813
00:50:27,201 --> 00:50:31,635
Emily: Anyway, it was just weird and just completely batshit random.

814
00:50:31,715 --> 00:50:33,280
Emily: and so Nury and I were reading this.

815
00:50:34,342 --> 00:50:35,245
Emily: You know, I bought this.

816
00:50:35,305 --> 00:50:40,603
Emily: you have to read it Nury and she starts reading it and flip it and then she starts laughing and Laughing.

817
00:50:40,683 --> 00:50:44,040
Emily: and so I think for the price paid that was that was well worth the money.

818
00:50:44,221 --> 00:50:53,780
Scott: It's definitely, you know, you go around you look at these indie comics You're like, you know These are not like the professional high-quality amazing entertainment package that you would get, you know from pretty much anything.

819
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,539
Scott: That's actually in a comic book store, right?

820
00:50:56,180 --> 00:51:05,110
Scott: But in terms of like the price per entertainment like the value, you know of what you're getting is like So much higher, you know for like 50 cents.

821
00:51:05,472 --> 00:51:07,200
Scott: You can get something like crazy lady, you know.

822
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:14,487
Scott: Or for a couple dollars you can get like, you know, friggin lumberjacks or actually that one little funky beer That one 24-hour comic.

823
00:51:14,527 --> 00:51:29,679
Emily: I bought Catan the spider, which was actually what I think I kind of agree with you because it was it was very different and the art was very sketchy But actually what it portrayed was very imaginative and I liked little dragons, too.

824
00:51:30,482 --> 00:51:31,865
Emily: I suppose I was swayed by that.

825
00:51:31,885 --> 00:51:34,231
Emily: little dentists little dentists little.

826
00:51:34,432 --> 00:51:35,194
Scott: so are we gonna?

827
00:51:35,455 --> 00:51:37,380
Scott: are we pretty much gonna wrap this up?

828
00:51:38,643 --> 00:51:51,200
Rym: We'll cut from here to a Various cavalcade of interviews and audio from the mocha floor and at some point in the near ish future We'll try to get up a video of the kind of unboxing and reviewing.

829
00:51:51,200 --> 00:52:04,497
Scott: Yeah We'll do some sort of Scott's box ish kind of like mocha edition where we display the the hall Haul of what all the stuff that we got the hall from the hall mocha hall.

830
00:52:04,517 --> 00:52:08,084
Scott: Yay I'm Steven vratos.

831
00:52:08,185 --> 00:52:09,128
Rym: I work for fanfare

Scott: opponent Mon publishing

00:52:10,873 --> 00:52:11,596
Emily: much like Japan,

834
00:52:11,616 --> 00:52:11,856
Rym: which is

835
00:52:11,917 --> 00:52:13,020
Scott: one of our better-selling books

836
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:13,682
Rym: Which

00:52:14,204 --> 00:52:16,290

Rym: creators talking about their views in Japan.

Emily: Korea will be coming out.

840
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:29,307
Emily: we'll probably have advanced copy of San Diego comic-con and it's 12 different creators on their perception of Korea and It's a really wonderful book.

841
00:52:33,372 --> 00:52:34,234
Emily: We're pretty happy.

842
00:52:34,355 --> 00:52:39,729
Rym: fanfare fanfare has seven seven nominations for Eisner's this season.

843
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:44,234
Emily: so yeah, you know and Part of like.

844
00:52:44,274 --> 00:52:44,775
Rym: why can't this?

845
00:52:44,815 --> 00:52:53,440
Scott: the comic I buy look like that, you know part of being the artist you it's like you gotta You learn each time you get your thing printed.

846
00:52:53,641 --> 00:52:55,788
Scott: But you got to learn what works and what doesn't.

847
00:52:55,849 --> 00:52:56,692
Scott: what reproduces.

848
00:52:56,752 --> 00:52:58,619
Rym: well on what doesn't you know as an artist?

849
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:04,920
Scott: I get really into like some of the dry brush But some of the more subtle dry brushing doesn't show up very well.

850
00:53:05,241 --> 00:53:05,804
Emily: so you still

851
00:53:05,844 --> 00:53:08,255
Scott: have to have your your pretty bold areas

852
00:53:08,295 --> 00:53:11,846
Rym: of dark and light and You learn.

853
00:53:11,906 --> 00:53:13,317
Rym: you learn what works and what doesn't.

854
00:53:13,377 --> 00:53:16,230
Rym: yeah That's part of this is part of being a comic artist because you're not.

855
00:53:16,692 --> 00:53:20,120
Rym: you're not doing it to display the originals You're doing it to be reproduced.

856
00:53:21,103 --> 00:53:22,406
Rym: Part of the deal.

857
00:53:22,446 --> 00:53:24,251
Rym: comics look like that.

858
00:53:24,632 --> 00:53:27,520
Rym: Well, maybe for web comics you can do I guess you could.

859
00:53:28,502 --> 00:53:30,309
Rym: But even then it's like people's screens.

860
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:34,690
Scott: like, you know, some people's screens can't display all the colors So they don't have a lot of.

861
00:53:34,791 --> 00:53:36,079
Scott: it's just basic design, too.

862
00:53:37,642 --> 00:53:49,685
Emily: Okay, basically a lot of the words A lot of it is just basic design to you because even even if you have the highest resolution image you could possibly do It doesn't really matter.

863
00:53:49,745 --> 00:53:51,830
Emily: your eye can only take so much.

864
00:53:52,232 --> 00:53:57,613
Emily: your eye wants to have areas to rest and wants areas for it to be led.

865
00:53:57,957 --> 00:54:01,816
Scott: so If everything's is pretty detailed, but it's all the same tone.

866
00:54:01,836 --> 00:54:02,720
Rym: It's just not going to work.

867
00:54:03,221 --> 00:54:08,700
Scott: You need these areas of simplification even if it's an incredibly high resolution and high detail piece.

868
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:18,259
Scott: So you always have to keep that in mind, especially in comic pages because so much is going on In individual panels, you still have to think of it as a whole thing.

869
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:27,431
Rym: So larger, you know, it does well to officially just sell the like.

870
00:54:27,652 --> 00:54:29,880
Scott: here's the ultra edition at the hellboy stuff and those be.

871
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:34,572
Scott: Yeah, I. but the thing is though, like I love the small format.

872
00:54:34,613 --> 00:54:35,275
Scott: I really do like.

873
00:54:35,295 --> 00:54:46,760
Scott: I really do like small Like Comic guys, you know You know traditional comic fans miss that bigger or even the really bigger formats.

874
00:54:47,804 --> 00:54:49,459
Scott: You know like Alex Ross did those really big?

875
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:53,412
Rym: Those big superhero comics and I was like, uh, they look good.

876
00:54:53,613 --> 00:54:56,805
Emily: They look good obviously for painting like that But they're so in money.

877
00:54:56,845 --> 00:55:01,339
Scott: Yeah, I just would rather have a little book, you know read on the subway or whatever.

878
00:55:03,368 --> 00:55:03,655
Scott: That's you?

879
00:55:03,943 --> 00:55:06,897
Rym: Definitely You gotta tell me about this.

880
00:55:08,281 --> 00:55:10,210
Rym: So tell us a little bit about this movie.

881
00:55:10,391 --> 00:55:12,380
Rym: The movie is called Adam age vampire.

882
00:55:12,661 --> 00:55:17,220
Scott: I took the sound from a really old science fiction movie also called Adam age vampire.

883
00:55:17,622 --> 00:55:18,345
Rym: It's very bad.

884
00:55:18,365 --> 00:55:21,539
Scott: took the sound and animated a new movie to it.

885
00:55:24,361 --> 00:55:25,586
Scott: Hopefully there will be no more poop.

886
00:55:25,667 --> 00:55:28,277
Emily: Yes, that's that's the hopes and the dreams of my.

887
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:29,625
Scott: no I wanted to do with three.

888
00:55:29,686 --> 00:55:31,579
Scott: I wanted to be a trilogy from the beginning.

889
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,260
Scott: Yeah, I'm a regular George Lucas.

890
00:55:37,841 --> 00:55:43,094

891
00:55:43,735 --> 00:55:49,499

892
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:57,206
Scott: Basically what it is is I had a journal for like the last Ten years and I decided

893
00:55:57,547 --> 00:55:57,908
Rym: to make it

894
00:55:57,928 --> 00:56:06,323
Emily: into a comic and the journal is basically just me ranting which basically, the girl is Trying.

895
00:56:06,403 --> 00:56:14,359
Emily: the girl in the comic is trying to just find her path and figure out her place in the world And that's that's pretty much what it's about.

Rym: So who should read saltwater taffy?

918
00:57:40,161 --> 00:57:46,940
Scott: I think everyone should read it because When I say they're all ages it really I really did write it so that really anyone can enjoy the adventure.

919
00:57:47,462 --> 00:57:50,839
Rym: I would say it probably starts at like age 8 and go and up.

920
00:57:52,042 --> 00:57:54,116
Rym: But but I think that anyone can get something out of it.

921
00:57:54,136 --> 00:58:05,800
Rym: Definitely Did you watch everything that the blockbuster had including the bad stuff like Armageddon and Doom Megalopolis?

922
00:58:06,364 --> 00:58:15,951
Emily: No, no, I saw Doom Megalopolis on TV once though I had like a weird antenna channel and it just came in and I saw I think there's a scene where the guy was like Fish or something like that.

923
00:58:16,011 --> 00:58:21,703
Emily: I was like 13 years old and I was like So it was.

924
00:58:21,783 --> 00:58:26,100
Emily: it was kind of shocking but and then I that's actually how I got started reading comics too.

925
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:28,032
Rym: It's because I love beautiful dreamer so much.

926
00:58:28,052 --> 00:58:29,240

928
00:58:33,061 --> 00:58:35,080
Rym: They were calling it like return of the bomb or something.

929
00:58:35,361 --> 00:58:38,960
Rym: That's when they were coming out on monthly issues and I went in every month and I would just pick it up.

930
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:40,727
Rym: I was like, I don't know who half these people are.

931
00:58:40,747 --> 00:58:41,571
Rym: They're not in the movie.

932
00:58:41,591 --> 00:58:43,118
Rym: I was like, why is she calling?

933
00:58:43,158 --> 00:58:46,150
Rym: That's weird But it was just all downhill from there.

934
00:58:46,371 --> 00:58:49,306
Emily: And so when I saw that tour to Uniqlo, I was like, yes That's right here.

935
00:58:49,366 --> 00:58:55,516
Emily: Like lung was my screen name on AOL back in like 95 or something like that.

938
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:11,780
Emily: It's it's about like a brother and a sister who gets stuck in another world.

939
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,808
Rym: It's like kind of like Narnia, but with teenagers.

940
00:59:14,209 --> 00:59:16,939
Rym: so you get like a lot of like teenage fighting and stuff like that, too.

941
00:59:17,205 --> 00:59:25,330
Rym: so But it's it's I'm trying to do the kind of stuff that I liked when I was a teenager Like I loved like magic pack rare and stuff like that.

942
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:26,995
Rym: So that's that's what I'm going for.

943
00:59:27,035 --> 00:59:28,179
Rym: It's like I want to do that again.

944
00:59:29,622 --> 00:59:33,058
Rym: Did you watch the dub or the sub with the subtitles all the way?

945
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,339
Scott: Openers in English with Sandy Fox.

946
00:59:37,881 --> 00:59:38,985
Emily: Yeah, I remember that.

947
00:59:39,446 --> 00:59:41,955
Emily: no, I'd actually been watching it at my anime club at that point.

948
00:59:41,996 --> 00:59:45,059
Emily: so I was like school And that was how I got into it.

949
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:48,513
Scott: I was like the only person there who was in the target demographic for rare.

950
00:59:48,553 --> 00:59:53,785
Scott: that was like 13 or 14 and I was like oh my god, and Everybody else there was like.

951
00:59:53,805 --> 00:59:58,100
Scott: it's like older dudes who like sci-fi stuff, but like thinking back on it.

952
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:59,346
Scott: I think they just showed it for me.

953
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:01,136
Scott: They were like, all right, she sits through Gundam.

954
01:00:01,176 --> 01:00:01,940
Emily: Let's throw her away.

955
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:07,880
Scott: So and then it just like it just kind of made me want to do my own comics from that.

956
01:00:08,081 --> 01:00:11,899
Scott: So it was like things like that really are kind of what got me started.

957
01:00:12,625 --> 01:00:12,867
Scott: Sure.

958
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:13,088

01:00:15,681 --> 01:00:17,871
Emily: My webcomic is winters in the Lavelle.

961
01:00:18,193 --> 01:00:19,057
Rym: It's winters in Lavelle.

962
01:00:19,097 --> 01:00:19,398
Rym: calm.

963
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:25,620
Rym: Patrick McQuade the artist of shapes the new brethren.

964
01:00:26,402 --> 01:00:29,232
Scott: Steve Solis the namer of shapes the new brethren.

965
01:00:29,554 --> 01:00:30,316
Rym: So what's going on here?

966
01:00:30,336 --> 01:00:31,300
Rym: What does this you guys do?

967
01:00:31,541 --> 01:00:39,725
Rym: well, what started in high school chemistry class back in the fall of 1994 has Evolved to the new brethren.

968
01:00:40,507 --> 01:00:42,974
Rym: we did about 400 shapes in high school.

969
01:00:43,456 --> 01:00:57,008
Rym: What happens is Steve You know in the back of ditto paper or whatever Withdraw a bunch of abstract shapes and then he would pass them off to me and I would create a character You know inside or inspired by that shape.

970
01:00:57,509 --> 01:01:01,300
Rym: then I would pass it back to Steve and he would give that character a name.

971
01:01:02,042 --> 01:01:05,093
Rym: So again, we did about 400 in high school and it kind of stopped.

972
01:01:05,595 --> 01:01:21,524
Rym: and then in 2005 We reconnected via email and and via the posted postal service and you know, we did a whole new a new new batch and then And then the new brethren.

973
01:01:21,845 --> 01:01:35,089
Rym: in the last six months we've done 34 new characters and Yeah, they are the new brethren and We have characters like Ramburger the Chancellor Stag, Willy and the Fronion man.

974
01:01:35,792 --> 01:01:42,575
Rym: And the book is kind of like a whole shows all history and evolution of the process and documents the whole The whole.

975
01:01:42,696 --> 01:01:44,184
Rym: you know the whole deal.

976
01:01:44,284 --> 01:01:51,353
Scott: So yeah I Discovered my passion for cartooning right after 9/11.

977
01:01:51,353 --> 01:01:53,368
Rym: as a turban and a bearded man.

978
01:01:53,569 --> 01:01:56,420
Rym: a Lot of people know didn't know who six are.

979
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:58,230
Scott: so I was really a target of a lot of hate crimes.

980
01:01:58,752 --> 01:02:12,930
Scott: but one thing that inspired me is a couple of cartoonists who actually Sketched six into their cartoons showing them as victims of hate crimes and I said, hey, that's interesting Maybe you know, there should be more cartoons about six.

981
01:02:13,010 --> 01:02:28,969
Rym: So that's how it got started and that was almost eight years ago, and I came up with the idea of sick tunes Cartoon sick tunes and I basically take news items from around the world relating to six and Create a single usually single panel cartoons.

982
01:02:30,271 --> 01:02:45,385
Scott: so a lot of the stuff you see here is from the last eight years this piece the I Call this the American turban chronicles collection and it's kind of like my experience and a lot of other people who wear turbans with a lot of it comes from ignorance.

983
01:02:45,405 --> 01:02:46,170
Scott: people don't know who.

984
01:02:47,191 --> 01:02:50,999
Scott: People presume that everybody who wears a turban is Arab or Muslim, which is not true.

985
01:02:51,601 --> 01:03:01,450
Rym: So this is my way of Also looking within our own community and making people think about our shortcomings and those kind of things.

986
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:04,361
Rym: So this is it looks like your first time at the mocha.

987
01:03:04,422 --> 01:03:05,406
Rym: Yeah, are you having a good time?

Rym: I mean the response is great.

990
01:03:08,015 --> 01:03:13,476
Rym: People are coming in and you know, they they haven't seen Turbans and beards in cartoons.

991
01:03:13,496 --> 01:03:14,179
Emily: So they're really.

992
01:03:14,199 --> 01:03:18,830
Rym: they're kind of you know, they're really coming in and they're like wow I mean, so yeah, it's been a great response.

1000
01:03:59,713 --> 01:04:14,350
Emily: Yeah, just about this whole row is all CCS kids and we all decided that we wanted to Control our own destinies with the webcomic and have a you know Instantaneous access to readers in a way that print comics sometimes takes longer to do.

1001
01:04:14,531 --> 01:04:16,648
Emily: So that's sort of the reason we all did this.

1002
01:04:17,352 --> 01:04:21,750
Rym: Yeah, I mean you get back right away you start you can get it out to people and get responses for it.

1003
01:04:21,770 --> 01:04:26,670
Rym: So it's really gratifying Like I've got a couple people who actually follow the comic and email me and I just care about it.

1004
01:04:27,212 --> 01:04:33,286
Emily: So it keeps you moving forward because it feels like people are enjoying your work, which I mean Kind of what I like about it.

1005
01:04:33,590 --> 01:04:35,985
Emily: It seems to be the way that print media could be going.

1006
01:04:36,025 --> 01:04:37,854
Emily: is that you uh You have a webcomic.

1007
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:44,060
Emily: you can actually prove to editors and publishers how many readers you have using Google Analytics And then they'll be like, I guess we could print you.

1008
01:04:44,261 --> 01:04:44,944

1009
01:04:45,165 --> 01:04:49,022
Emily: We love your stuff, too And we also like to hang out and drink together.

01:04:49,102 --> 01:04:50,950

1011
01:04:51,191 --> 01:04:51,935
