1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:06,285
Rym: Well, if you couldn't tell from the lack of music, it's not a normal episode of GeekNights Which means it's that time again.

2
00:00:06,306 --> 00:00:08,935
Scott: You're not even putting the music in the specials anymore.

3
00:00:09,296 --> 00:00:11,042
Rym: I've never put music in the special I don't know.

4
00:00:11,083 --> 00:00:14,860
Scott: I don't listen to the specials because they're not so specials have never had music in them.

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,267
Rym: They're just we start talking.

6
00:00:16,488 --> 00:00:20,909
Scott: No, okay, then take that Specials take that internet fair.

7
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:22,495
Rym: But yeah, I'm out of town.

8
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:28,900
Rym: So this Episode was actually recorded last night and there probably won't be a show tomorrow night.

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,517
Rym: Let's Scott and Emily decide to figure out how to use my computer to record something.

10
00:00:32,718 --> 00:00:33,542
Scott: if I did I would just.

11
00:00:33,562 --> 00:00:39,739
Scott: it would just be low audio quality and I would just push record and then Stop and then make an mp3 with no editing.

12
00:00:40,843 --> 00:00:42,018
Scott: So that that's what it would be.

13
00:00:42,261 --> 00:00:45,100
Rym: But yeah, I know we have a lot of new listeners coming in periodically.

14
00:00:45,261 --> 00:00:50,640
Rym: But if you've never listened to GeekNights before you might want to check out any other episode before you listen to this one.

15
00:00:50,681 --> 00:00:51,900
Rym: This is what we call a special.

16
00:00:52,402 --> 00:00:56,400
Rym: Special is code on GeekNights for we were too lazy to make a real show.

17
00:00:56,601 --> 00:01:04,355
Scott: So we made a show that takes a quarter the effort in half the time unlike specials on television Which means they put in more effort more time and more money to try to get new listeners.

18
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:08,440
Scott: This is laziness to keep existing listeners.

19
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:17,260
Rym: I mean we could have a very special GeekNights But that would mean like Scott locked himself in a refrigerator in a dump yard and almost died and then we all learned something.

20
00:01:17,763 --> 00:01:19,839
Rym: All right, like that episode of punky Brewster.

21
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,107
Scott: I never watched punky Brewster ever.

22
00:01:22,127 --> 00:01:24,880
Scott: I've heard of it and I know it's some show but that's all I know.

23
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,896
Rym: You don't know about the tonight on a very special name of show.

24
00:01:29,117 --> 00:01:29,960
Scott: I do know about that.

25
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,490
Rym: Yes, cuz punky Brewster I believe started that.

26
00:01:33,033 --> 00:01:34,700
Scott: Oh punky Brewster's live-action show.

27
00:01:35,741 --> 00:01:36,646
Scott: Yeah, I never.

28
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:38,234
Scott: I didn't know anything about.

29
00:01:38,254 --> 00:01:39,300
Rym: it was a live-action show.

30
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,680
Scott: I never knew anything about it at all other than there was a show called punky Brewster that I never watched.

31
00:01:43,721 --> 00:01:44,717
Rym: I used to watch it as a kid.

32
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,591
Scott: Well, it was on for 1984 to 86 and then again in 87 and 88 with some syndication.

33
00:01:51,321 --> 00:01:54,393
Rym: I watched a lot of reruns on channel 9.

34
00:01:54,393 --> 00:02:00,740
Rym: I was watching elf I think during those times You know as a kid, I'd say that I watched some good stuff and some bad stuff.

35
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,806
Rym: I mean I watched he-man.

36
00:02:01,887 --> 00:02:03,677
Rym: but now I know that he-man was terrible.

37
00:02:03,798 --> 00:02:07,460
Scott: Yeah Not I'm glad I watched it when I was a kid because when I was a kid was awesome.

38
00:02:07,821 --> 00:02:11,436
Rym: Yeah, but I think the worst show I watched as a kid was small wonder.

39
00:02:11,657 --> 00:02:12,420
Scott: I don't know what that is.

40
00:02:13,143 --> 00:02:14,027
Rym: It's not good.

41
00:02:14,047 --> 00:02:14,811
Rym: All right.

42
00:02:15,414 --> 00:02:16,500
Scott: Anyway, I'll take your word for it.

43
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:30,631
Rym: So instead of doing you know, it's a special if we can do whatever we want But it is anime manga comic night and it just so happens that over the last weekend We got an email from a listener that Scott wanted to talk about it right away But we decided to wait until the night where it was topical.

44
00:02:30,671 --> 00:02:33,984
Rym: and now that we're doing a special it seems like the perfect day To broach this topic.

45
00:02:34,064 --> 00:02:34,265
Rym: Well,

46
00:02:34,345 --> 00:02:45,340
Scott: not only is this pretty like the specifics of this email very topical But I have a rant that has been building up inside of me and I've been letting loose little by little

47
00:02:45,521 --> 00:02:55,853
Rym: Mostly because unlike me Scott hangs out on the comic geek speak forums and they're cool people and he hangs out there But I think he disagrees with 75% of the opinions posited there.

48
00:02:55,934 --> 00:03:01,314
Rym: perhaps but like I Wager that he is that guy in those forums.

49
00:03:01,374 --> 00:03:05,129
Rym: I mean, you know probably yeah I'm definitely that you all know that there's that guy in our forums.

50
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:07,076
Rym: I think you know exactly who that guy is.

51
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:10,879
Rym: Well, uh Anyway, everyone's thinking am I that guy?

52
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:20,060
Scott: But anyway, this is rant that's been building and this doesn't target that rant directly But it is encompassed by my rant and therefore is an excuse for me to let loose.

53
00:03:20,522 --> 00:03:23,420
Rym: I'm going to read this email in its entirety before we come in.

54
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,409
Scott: I mean, it's a special and we're only doing one geek back.

55
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:25,872
Scott: So why not?

56
00:03:26,073 --> 00:03:26,274
Scott: Yeah.

57
00:03:26,515 --> 00:03:27,560
Rym: Now the email is from Kate.

58
00:03:28,422 --> 00:03:31,356
Rym: You know in radio, it's like Kate from Iowa, but I have no idea where Kate's.

59
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:34,868
Scott: from the internet Kate what don't manage you from Kate?

60
00:03:34,908 --> 00:03:38,036
Rym: It doesn't say at something at us dot something.

61
00:03:38,076 --> 00:03:39,420
Rym: I imagine it's in America.

62
00:03:40,992 --> 00:03:51,240
Rym: Anyway While I applaud the idea of not buying bootlegs and not pirating after something is licensed The real thing hurting anime DVD sales is people not buying DVDs.

63
00:03:53,082 --> 00:04:03,771
Rym: The quote/unquote rule of fan subs is if you enjoyed watching the show You should buy it not if you loved it not if it changed your life But if you just liked it and were entertained.

64
00:04:04,254 --> 00:04:07,855
Rym: no matter what the u.s Anime industry is not like the Japanese industry.

65
00:04:08,258 --> 00:04:11,913
Rym: the u.s Doesn't get to rely on advertisers for their revenue for the most part.

66
00:04:12,114 --> 00:04:13,680
Rym: They have to rely on us the fans.

67
00:04:14,262 --> 00:04:18,720
Rym: So while renting anime is all well and good to see if you like the show shouldn't the same rules apply?

68
00:04:19,281 --> 00:04:22,071
Rym: Because otherwise while it might not make people feel bad.

69
00:04:22,172 --> 00:04:24,520
Rym: It is just as hurtful to the industry.

70
00:04:25,401 --> 00:04:29,780
Rym: I feel like I just wish into a what's-it-pepper box voice, then I just keep going is it?

71
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,990
Rym: And Since most DVDs are well-priced even cheap.

72
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:34,772
Rym: It's not too hard.

73
00:04:35,534 --> 00:04:36,556
Rym: I also hear complaints.

74
00:04:36,757 --> 00:04:37,860
Rym: You spelled here wrong.

75
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:47,838
Rym: Kate I'm sorry about the price of US anime DVDs, but if you really think about it $30 is a good price for four or five episodes.

76
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:53,373
Rym: Yeah, I remember paying $30 for just two episodes of cowboy bebop on VHS.

77
00:04:53,975 --> 00:04:55,178
Rym: I also remember those times.

78
00:04:55,198 --> 00:04:56,080
Rym: those were dark days.

79
00:04:57,025 --> 00:05:00,000
Rym: Now I'm not saying that is right, but anime is the niche market.

80
00:05:00,321 --> 00:05:05,380
Rym: So it seems ludicrous to expect the same price on a DVD of the latest spider-man movie on DVD.

81
00:05:06,142 --> 00:05:10,840
Rym: Anyway, what I'm getting at is that we all need to buy more anime period Kate.

82
00:05:12,441 --> 00:05:18,520
Scott: Alright Kate I got like I could have stopped it like ten different places in your email and said how dumb you are.

83
00:05:19,482 --> 00:05:20,366
Rym: Not so much dumb.

84
00:05:20,406 --> 00:05:23,080
Scott: No, no, yeah, but how you are wrong.

85
00:05:23,321 --> 00:05:27,097
Rym: I'm gonna get my words in edgewise cuz I think once Scott gets going he's not gonna stop.

86
00:05:27,238 --> 00:05:29,207
Scott: maybe Let me try to dig up this email.

87
00:05:29,247 --> 00:05:31,699
Scott: I shut my laptop so I can go back into it.

88
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,360
Rym: Yeah Well, I do find it funny.

89
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,166
Rym: I mean I got to make fun of any email I read.

90
00:05:35,207 --> 00:05:39,020
Rym: but the real thing hurting anime DVD sales is people not buying DVDs.

91
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:45,280
Rym: That is a beautiful example of the kind of marketing speak that I used to hear at IBM at like business meetings.

92
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:48,920
Scott: The real problem is like people have made frames.

93
00:05:49,101 --> 00:05:54,080
Rym: They would say a long sentence that basically said sales are down because people aren't buying our products.

94
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,926
Rym: Wow, yeah, that would that was.

95
00:05:57,047 --> 00:06:00,840
Rym: that was beautiful and transcendent, but let's ignore fan subs.

96
00:06:01,142 --> 00:06:03,159
Rym: We're not gonna talk about fan subs at all.

97
00:06:03,561 --> 00:06:09,100
Rym: Let's just talk about either you're pirating something illegally or you were watching it legally.

98
00:06:09,944 --> 00:06:13,439
Rym: So anime is available in the US on DVD and I can purchase it.

99
00:06:13,982 --> 00:06:18,680
Rym: It is perfectly legal for me to rent it and that has been upheld in courts time and time and time again.

100
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,535
Rym: The rental industry is perfectly legal.

101
00:06:20,556 --> 00:06:29,148
Rym: Mm-hmm And also the copies I am renting were purchased by the company that is renting them out And they have the full legal right to do that.

102
00:06:29,369 --> 00:06:31,015
Rym: It was paid for and it is done.

103
00:06:31,035 --> 00:06:44,086
Rym: Mm-hmm If it is available legally at that whatever price or whatever means then I don't think anyone can be morally impinged upon by Purchasing it or consuming it in that way.

104
00:06:44,106 --> 00:06:45,692
Rym: I mean just straight up.

105
00:06:45,752 --> 00:06:48,120
Rym: I can't make the argument more directly than that.

106
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:54,800
Rym: Watching it in Netflix or watching it on Blockbuster is identical to purchasing it as far as I'm concerned.

107
00:06:55,941 --> 00:06:58,073
Scott: Yeah, why not make sense to me?

108
00:06:58,636 --> 00:07:08,629
Rym: Yeah, and The real issue I mean aside from that just one renting it still generates revenue because if something's rented a lot Netflix in those places have to buy more copies of it.

109
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,800
Rym: and I know for a fact that anime fans ruin DVDs.

110
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:16,055
Scott: I can't tell you how many times we got scratch DVDs from Netflix and we send them back.

111
00:07:16,175 --> 00:07:23,740
Scott: and I must assume that if the Demand for that DVD remains the same because anime fans keep renting it and scratching it that Netflix is buying more copies.

112
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,386
Rym: So but it's only people.

113
00:07:25,406 --> 00:07:27,735
Scott: you're hurting the anime industry because you're not scratching.

114
00:07:27,755 --> 00:07:28,699
Scott: your Netflix is enough.

115
00:07:29,342 --> 00:07:31,500
Scott: That's your Netflix is more to help the anime industry.

116
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:37,275
Rym: But I mean that issue aside if someone has the choice of getting something illegal or getting it legally.

117
00:07:37,636 --> 00:07:38,658
Rym: getting it legally wins.

118
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:51,380
Rym: if Someone has two means of getting something legally say buying it at full Manufacturers suggested retail price from the company directly or Buying it super cheap used from deep discount DVD.

119
00:07:52,221 --> 00:08:01,991
Scott: There's no difference between those two options or getting it in like a box for ten bucks at a convention years Later or renting it from Netflix or borrowing it from a friend.

120
00:08:02,151 --> 00:08:03,976
Rym: or I watch cowboy bebop.

121
00:08:04,037 --> 00:08:05,140
Rym: I'm done with it here.

122
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:10,100
Rym: Take my DVDs I don't need them and then you watch it and then you give them to someone else to watch them and we just pass them.

123
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,589
Rym: Now notice not copying not ripping but just giving.

124
00:08:14,091 --> 00:08:15,855
Rym: yeah trading or selling used.

125
00:08:16,156 --> 00:08:17,059
Scott: what's wrong with that?

126
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:24,946
Scott: this part This Kate seems to think that if you watch something and you like it you are somehow Obligated to spend money on it.

127
00:08:25,107 --> 00:08:27,774
Scott: Even if you wouldn't have spent let's like here.

128
00:08:27,814 --> 00:08:35,600
Scott: Let's pretend there's an anime a right anime a comes out and I watch the fan subs, but it wasn't that great.

129
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:36,591
Scott: But I watched him anyway.

130
00:08:36,611 --> 00:08:42,236
Scott: cuz I was bored Kate seems to think I should go and buy the DVDs, even if I'm never gonna watch the show again now.

131
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,295
Scott: Let's pretend that that same show came out and for whatever reason I wasn't bored.

132
00:08:47,415 --> 00:08:48,800
Scott: So I never watched the fan subs.

133
00:08:49,602 --> 00:08:51,873
Scott: I still wouldn't have bought the DVDs ever.

134
00:08:51,914 --> 00:08:57,916
Scott: There is no situation Where I would have bought the DVDs not like the fan subs prevented me from buying the DVDs.

135
00:08:58,297 --> 00:09:02,900
Scott: if I was gonna buy it I was gonna buy it and the fan subs aren't gonna change whether I was gonna buy it or not.

136
00:09:03,582 --> 00:09:08,959
Scott: So just cuz I like something I'm not under any obligation to spend money on it.

137
00:09:09,807 --> 00:09:13,669
Scott: If I'm gonna spend money on it I'm gonna and if I'm not I'm not.

138
00:09:13,709 --> 00:09:20,443
Scott: and you're not gonna say oh you're guilty cuz you didn't spend money You're not guilty.

139
00:09:20,744 --> 00:09:24,394
Rym: yeah, I mean before we get into the deeper issues here it is there's.

140
00:09:24,495 --> 00:09:37,380
Rym: I just think of it this way Practically from a purely practical rational standpoint ignore morals or anything else Even though I think the moral argument is clear in this case as well because you are purchasing it legally or watching it legally

141
00:09:37,721 --> 00:09:40,045
Scott: Well from a law and morals and I say but

142
00:09:40,126 --> 00:09:47,149
Rym: even then from a purely rational perspective Say I wanted to watch a show So I rent it all and I watch it all.

143
00:09:47,812 --> 00:09:51,879
Rym: if the show wasn't that good and I door I just don't feel like I'm ever gonna watch it again.

144
00:09:52,521 --> 00:09:59,700
Rym: What purpose does purchasing a physical meet a good that had to be manufactured and then letting it take up space in my house serve?

145
00:10:00,283 --> 00:10:12,113
Rym: What if I do buy all the anime that I liked just to support people but then I just sell that anime on eBay or I just give it away or I throw it away a Waste plastic and paper and your money.

146
00:10:12,294 --> 00:10:13,220
Rym: Yeah, it wastes energy.

147
00:10:13,523 --> 00:10:17,880
Rym: There's no point to buying something I've already seen unless I want to show it to someone else or watch it again.

148
00:10:18,241 --> 00:10:19,485
Rym: And honestly a lot of anime.

149
00:10:19,525 --> 00:10:20,528
Rym: if I want to watch it again.

150
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,554
Rym: I'll just Netflix it again.

151
00:10:22,574 --> 00:10:24,480
Rym: Yeah, that's sadly enough.

152
00:10:25,183 --> 00:10:37,660
Scott: Now the deeper issue a deeper issue is this It seems to think it seems to me that what Kate is asking people to do is Basically treat the anime company like a charity.

153
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:40,888
Scott: Well, the anime company is in need that you.

154
00:10:40,928 --> 00:10:51,980
Scott: they do something we like and therefore out of the good of our hearts Even if we don't want the product they're selling we should give them our money just because we like them so much.

155
00:10:52,582 --> 00:10:54,007
Rym: Now it's not just anime.

156
00:10:54,047 --> 00:10:56,416
Rym: I mean I want to touch on the really deeper issue here.

157
00:10:56,477 --> 00:11:03,970
Rym: Yep in particularly anime manga Science-fiction fandom this seems comics

158
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:18,470
Scott: any niche geeky market Mostly the niche geeky markets where there is a professional industry of some sort, you know, like indie comic books or Small toy companies that make cool statues

159
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:24,011
Rym: there seems to be in the in this whole market a culture of You should support

160
00:11:24,212 --> 00:11:25,240
Scott: even like indie music.

161
00:11:25,369 --> 00:11:32,300
Rym: Yep You should support the scene and support the industry even if you don't actually like the individual things in the industry.

162
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,819
Rym: You know, hey palladium is going out of business.

163
00:11:35,422 --> 00:11:39,820
Rym: Everyone who cares about gaming should purchase palladium books to keep them from going out of business.

164
00:11:40,483 --> 00:11:43,258
Rym: Hey indie comic artist X isn't doing so.

165
00:11:43,318 --> 00:11:47,297
Rym: well Buy his comics even if you don't like him just to support him.

166
00:11:47,397 --> 00:11:50,107
Scott: or hey Indie comic artist has a new comic.

167
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:56,634
Scott: you like you should buy the monthly issues that are full of ads instead of the trade that You actually want or else the trade might never come about.

168
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:57,760
Rym: I think that's the worst thing.

169
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:12,412
Rym: That's the worst one that bothers me more than anything in the world is when some comic fan tells me that by not purchasing these gigantic poorly printed annoying hard to store Expensive monthlies or weeklies or whatever.

170
00:12:12,714 --> 00:12:13,820
Rym: that is a pain in the ass.

171
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:23,340
Rym: I just want to throw them away when I'm done with them and waiting for the you know Rational format the book the bound book that has the entire story in it with no ads.

172
00:12:23,641 --> 00:12:25,989
Scott: That by waiting less money for more pages.

173
00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:29,300
Rym: I am somehow the reason that the comic industry is not doing well.

174
00:12:30,062 --> 00:12:43,060
Rym: maybe The fact that the reason the way they're making money is by having to sell the product that no one wants and people the people Who buy that product buy it out of charity as opposed to out of actual desire is the actual problem.

175
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:54,913
Scott: Yes, the main point here is that you should never under any circumstance blame the Consumer for the failure of the business.

176
00:12:55,154 --> 00:12:59,211
Scott: if a business is not making money It is not the consumers fault.

177
00:12:59,493 --> 00:13:04,371
Scott: in a capitalist society 110% of the time it is the business's fault.

178
00:13:04,611 --> 00:13:09,749
Scott: if a TV needs money because no one's buying DVDs It's a TV's fault for selling DVDs shittily.

179
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:16,130
Scott: if some indie comic artist doesn't make money because I don't buy the money Monthly's that's his fault for being stupid and printing monthly's.

180
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,214
Scott: that he lost money on it.

181
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:23,112
Scott: if some guy Makes like some fan film and that he doesn't make his money back.

182
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:31,120
Scott: if palladium books is going out of business It's because they're making a product no one wants or selling it improperly or failing to market it properly.

183
00:13:31,281 --> 00:13:33,271
Scott: Well, it's not my fault for not buying it.

184
00:13:33,472 --> 00:13:35,019
Scott: This is not a fucking charity.

185
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,783
Scott: Businesses are not charity.

186
00:13:36,803 --> 00:13:37,846
Scott: if I'm gonna give to charity.

187
00:13:38,127 --> 00:13:40,252
Scott: I'm gonna give to poor starving kids in Africa.

188
00:13:40,593 --> 00:13:45,608
Scott: palladium books or ATV films Marvel Comics are not charities.

189
00:13:45,849 --> 00:13:46,732
Scott: They are businesses.

190
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:47,634
Scott: if they don't have money.

191
00:13:47,915 --> 00:13:48,617
Scott: It's their fault.

192
00:13:48,658 --> 00:13:50,228
Scott: if they go out of business I don't give a shit.

193
00:13:50,249 --> 00:13:51,279
Scott: It's not my problem.

194
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:58,856
Rym: Damn, I knew you had your aunt and I saw it coming But I actually had to turn you down because the compressor didn't know what to do.

195
00:13:58,876 --> 00:14:04,653
Scott: Ah, man Don't tell me that we should support someone.

196
00:14:04,794 --> 00:14:07,911
Scott: if someone can't support themselves That's their fault.

197
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:10,507
Scott: if they want my money They should make something I want.

198
00:14:10,527 --> 00:14:13,600
Scott: I mean I am a person who pays money for things I want.

199
00:14:13,963 --> 00:14:15,377
Rym: I mean just the anime right?

200
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:15,640
Rym: All right.

201
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,583
Rym: So I want a Netflix stuff.

202
00:14:16,604 --> 00:14:20,378
Rym: the reason I Netflix most anime is because most anime is not that great.

203
00:14:20,558 --> 00:14:21,843
Rym: and you know Hey, that was cool.

204
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:28,378
Rym: I like I didn't mind seeing that but I wasn't willing to pay more than practically nothing to see it like.

205
00:14:29,261 --> 00:14:30,526
Rym: There's a lot of anime that i'll buy.

206
00:14:30,566 --> 00:14:35,289
Rym: if the price is right pretty much once it gets to five dollars the dvd or less I'll buy almost anything.

207
00:14:35,471 --> 00:14:36,840
Scott: Yeah, I mean we bought freaking what?

208
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,953
Rym: Grappler bocce god, well that was special.

209
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:41,720
Rym: those ended up being pretty much free.

210
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:45,840
Scott: I know I know but i'm saying like we bought like ko beast at a convention for cheap.

211
00:14:46,201 --> 00:14:51,240
Scott: I wouldn't have paid full price for ko beast but it's worth it to me to pay 10 bucks for it.

212
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,950
Scott: Yeah, but that's what i'm gonna pay plus.

213
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:57,739
Rym: Yeah, I mean you make the point that Thirty dollars for four or five episodes of something is a good price.

214
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:02,339
Rym: The thing is that was a good price eight years ago.

215
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,768
Rym: Nowadays, I mean look at in america how dvds are sold.

216
00:15:05,788 --> 00:15:10,222
Rym: you buy the whole season of like csi or whatever for like 20 or 30 Bucks.

217
00:15:10,645 --> 00:15:13,380
Scott: Yeah, I could buy a season of futurama for less than 30 bucks.

218
00:15:13,521 --> 00:15:16,540
Scott: Why would I buy four episodes of an anime for 30 bucks?

219
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,480
Rym: And the thing the other thing is, you know, why would I even buy the individuals?

220
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:28,596
Scott: I should buy the box set the thin pack even which takes up less space in my house Precious space in my house because you know what rent costs a lot more than dvds plus.

221
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:29,379
Rym: It's a fine line.

222
00:15:29,419 --> 00:15:30,487
Rym: I mean Where.

223
00:15:30,568 --> 00:15:31,800
Rym: what's the point at which it's not?

224
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:37,000
Rym: Okay, I mean like I said before all right buying the the dvds as they come out every month for full price?

225
00:15:37,722 --> 00:15:39,560
Rym: What if I buy those dvds on sale?

226
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,228
Rym: What if I buy those dvds used?

227
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,800
Rym: what if I buy those dvds from a reseller?

228
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,165
Rym: What's the point at which it's not if my friends lend them to me?

229
00:15:48,486 --> 00:15:49,448
Rym: Yeah, is lending.

230
00:15:49,528 --> 00:15:53,819
Rym: Okay legally it is Any anything legal shows it to me?

231
00:15:54,061 --> 00:15:55,608
Rym: What if an anime club runs a marathon?

232
00:15:55,628 --> 00:15:57,960
Rym: should anime clubs not run marathons of whole shows?

233
00:15:58,243 --> 00:15:59,839
Rym: Because that prevents people from buying the show?

234
00:16:00,782 --> 00:16:03,960
Scott: Oh, no, even though the anime company gave them permission to have the marathon.

235
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:08,231
Rym: Yeah I mean I I don't think I have much to say.

236
00:16:08,311 --> 00:16:10,980
Rym: we've been repeating ourselves because I think the argument is pretty straightforward.

237
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:19,440
Scott: Yes, basically all I want to do is all these people, you know, you you you're a geek You enjoy some niche product like an indie comic book, right?

238
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,002
Scott: And it's.

239
00:16:20,162 --> 00:16:28,595
Scott: it would be sad for you to see that go because you know you like it And you will only get it as long as the person who makes it is making money.

240
00:16:28,775 --> 00:16:30,060
Rym: like example firefly.

241
00:16:30,401 --> 00:16:32,689
Rym: A lot of firefly fans, but that's a good example.

242
00:16:32,729 --> 00:16:34,074
Scott: I didn't think of because I don't like it.

243
00:16:34,556 --> 00:16:35,780
Rym: I loved firefly.

244
00:16:35,921 --> 00:16:39,340
Rym: I did not like it was just like amazing and to this day.

245
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,980
Rym: I look back on it with such nostalgia and i've seen the whole thing like five times and i've watched the commentaries twice.

246
00:16:45,303 --> 00:16:46,311
Rym: Yep, it's great.

247
00:16:46,392 --> 00:16:49,569
Rym: I loved it but We have a friend.

248
00:16:49,589 --> 00:16:55,133
Rym: Let's say his name is uh Jot, sonson, ha ha so good thing.

249
00:16:55,174 --> 00:17:08,460
Rym: There are many people who share his name But people like him bought things About firefly that were not good like the firefly prequel to the movie comic which was absolute shit.

250
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:22,906
Rym: And a lot of these people bought multiple copies of it and they bought multiple box sets of the dvds not for any practical reason but to somehow try to boost sales and like Support it and support firefly.

251
00:17:22,925 --> 00:17:26,599
Scott: coming back like some of them would buy two one to keep and one to lend to friends.

252
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:27,285
Scott: That makes sense.

253
00:17:27,386 --> 00:17:28,919
Rym: No, there were people who bought three.

254
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,839
Rym: There were one to keep one to lend to friends and one to support joss weeden.

255
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:38,020
Scott: There are people who went to see the movie in the theaters multiple times or would buy extra tickets and only use one of them.

256
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:41,600
Rym: You know sadly while I like the movie it wasn't I mean it was a good movie.

257
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,315
Rym: It was a solid movie, but it wasn't super great.

258
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:47,710
Rym: It wasn't as good as the show It tried to do too much with it, but there are people.

259
00:17:47,891 --> 00:18:04,530
Scott: these people are buying products That they don't actually want the product or they're buying products They want but they're buying extras of it that they don't need or want or have room for simply because they want more of it and they they feel it.

260
00:18:04,811 --> 00:18:08,706
Scott: they're basically giving to charity and It's okay to give to charity.

261
00:18:08,827 --> 00:18:15,380
Scott: There is nothing wrong with giving to charity if you feel That your dollars are best spent, you know.

262
00:18:15,601 --> 00:18:23,334
Scott: If you let's say you're a mill you're bill gates and you love firefly and you you know If he spent all his money, he could have kept firefly afloat very easily.

263
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:24,036
Scott: He's bill gates.

264
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:27,013
Scott: if he did that That would have been an act of charity.

265
00:18:27,033 --> 00:18:27,900
Scott: Yeah, don't get me wrong.

266
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:31,313
Rym: We're not saying you people out there can't support an industry.

267
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:36,980
Rym: We're saying don't ever Ever get mad at anyone else for not doing the same thing.

268
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,325
Scott: You're exactly what i'm saying.

269
00:18:38,626 --> 00:18:45,874
Scott: if bill gates decides to save firefly or support an indie comic artist That's fine And actually you could commend him for doing that.

270
00:18:45,914 --> 00:18:51,660
Scott: if you think that's you know A good way to spend his money would of course actually bill gates spends his money in a much better way.

271
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,598
Scott: You know curing malaria, but uh who needs to give charity to curing malaria?

272
00:18:55,638 --> 00:18:55,739
Scott: when

273
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:57,245
Rym: you know a starving

274
00:18:57,345 --> 00:18:59,595
Scott: indie comic writer in new york, I would

275
00:18:59,896 --> 00:19:13,422
Rym: put forth a Relatively substantial amount of money if I could see more firefly Like like if it was a fact that if say ten thousand firefly fans each gave a thousand dollars There'd be another season I might.

276
00:19:13,864 --> 00:19:15,590
Rym: it might be worth a thousand dollars to me.

277
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:18,540
Scott: Yeah, you can if you want give to charity.

278
00:19:18,861 --> 00:19:19,523
Scott: It is charity.

279
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,971
Scott: Don't fool yourself and there's nothing wrong with that.

280
00:19:22,152 --> 00:19:24,419
Scott: It's perfectly fine if you love something that much.

281
00:19:25,141 --> 00:19:36,171
Scott: But the problem I have is when people go around and tell other people that they're bad or they're wrong or they Have an obligation because they like something to also give to charity.

282
00:19:36,672 --> 00:19:39,480
Scott: No one is ever obligated to give to charity nobody.

283
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,660
Scott: I mean, it's nice to do so but you can't tell someone they're bad for not doing it.

284
00:19:43,881 --> 00:19:46,300
Scott: I guess you could tell someone they're bad if they stole from charity.

285
00:19:46,483 --> 00:19:50,519
Scott: Yeah, that would be bad If you went into like the united way and just walked out with 20 bucks.

286
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,225
Rym: But then I mean like what's the if you?

287
00:19:52,386 --> 00:19:54,072
Rym: if someone is saying that what's the line?

288
00:19:54,353 --> 00:19:56,420
Rym: you didn't donate five thousand dollars to whatever?

289
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:00,000
Rym: You didn't give your kidney to some random person you're breathing air.

290
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:05,465
Rym: Someone else could be using that that that xbox you bought that those plastic I mean, what's the line?

291
00:20:05,585 --> 00:20:12,999
Scott: and it's even worse when they're talking about charity to For-profit companies usually, you know companies that are trying to make money.

292
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:19,970
Scott: You know if an anime is failing because it doesn't have good enough marketing That doesn't mean we should buy more dvs.

293
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,940
Scott: It means maybe adv should get better marketing.

294
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,133
Scott: It means maybe funimation should learn how to sell their dvds.

295
00:20:25,173 --> 00:20:26,940
Scott: Maybe bandai visuals should lower their prices.

296
00:20:27,404 --> 00:20:29,260
Scott: It's not my fault that they're not making money.

297
00:20:29,421 --> 00:20:30,003
Scott: It's their fault.

298
00:20:30,384 --> 00:20:34,440
Scott: and don't try to blame me because then i'll yell at you for on a special episode of GeekNights.

299
00:20:35,122 --> 00:20:38,351
Rym: Now one last thing before we end this and aside from everything else.

300
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:41,319
Rym: We've said there's one more reason why the argument really doesn't work.

301
00:20:42,142 --> 00:20:48,869
Rym: The anime industry in the us as far as anyone can determine Makes jack and shit off of dvd sales.

302
00:20:49,471 --> 00:20:57,135
Rym: the primary market is in merchandise Like plushy tachikomas or plushy cactuars, which I spent 40 on.

303
00:20:57,175 --> 00:20:58,057
Rym: Yeah for one.

304
00:20:59,221 --> 00:21:04,700
Scott: Well, someone might be making the argument that they would make money off dvds if you guys just buy them dude.

305
00:21:05,462 --> 00:21:07,660
Rym: But no the the all the money is in marketing.

306
00:21:07,922 --> 00:21:13,640
Rym: That's why a lot of shows that are really good Don't make a lot of money because a lot of those shows aren't very marketable.

307
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,437
Rym: I mean how much gankotsuo merchandise could is there out there?

308
00:21:17,537 --> 00:21:20,210
Rym: Not so much But how much bleach merchandise is there?

309
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:22,160
Rym: how much full metal alchemist merchandise was there?

310
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:27,720
Rym: Some shows are more marketable in that arena than others and those shows are the ones that tend to make piles and piles of money.

311
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:34,705
Scott: Yeah, if you want to talk about where vis's money is coming from or funimation's money is coming from It's from naruto merchandise.

312
00:21:34,985 --> 00:21:36,630
Scott: It ain't from naruto dvds.

313
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:38,134
Scott: Well naruto manga makes money.

314
00:21:38,254 --> 00:21:40,200
Rym: Well, plus I mean a show like naruto.

315
00:21:41,241 --> 00:21:43,979
Rym: That's a show that's pretty much designed to be watched on tv.

316
00:21:44,701 --> 00:21:44,842
Rym: You're.

317
00:21:44,983 --> 00:21:51,300
Rym: no I don't think anyone is reasonably expected to purchase The dvds of a show that goes on that long because you're never going to watch it again.

318
00:21:51,401 --> 00:21:54,460
Rym: It's something like it like says I saw it even though that's not out in here.

319
00:21:54,460 --> 00:22:07,120
Rym: Imagine a show that goes on for years and years and years or like the simpsons You know 13 14 20 40 seasons as it just keeps going Other than buying like the seasons that you care about because you want to show them again.

320
00:22:07,561 --> 00:22:11,416
Rym: I don't think anyone is reasonably expected to purchase the entirety of the simpsons.

321
00:22:11,476 --> 00:22:12,360
Rym: You saw it on tv.

322
00:22:12,562 --> 00:22:14,099
Rym: You got your enjoyment out of it.

323
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:22,078
Rym: I think you've got better things to do with your life than watch all those episodes again or track down The one episode from season 13 that you missed and buy it.

324
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:28,373
Scott: though I would like to own all the simpsons dvds I would like to own because then I could watch any simpsons episode at any time.

325
00:22:28,433 --> 00:22:31,309
Rym: I wanted to but I don't really have A need to.

326
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:32,922
Rym: you know much of a pain in the ass That would be.

327
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:43,820
Rym: i'd rather have but I would pay a lot of money to have a thing on my computer Where I can search through simpsons episodes scripts by words and find the exact episodes I want and then watch them.

328
00:22:43,921 --> 00:22:44,759
Scott: Give it five years.

329
00:22:45,224 --> 00:22:46,920
Rym: I would pay a lot of money for that.

330
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,406
Scott: You just sell hard drives at the store.

331
00:22:48,426 --> 00:22:58,029
Rym: that if every episode of the simpsons on them and you can search through all the episodes And they're all you know how much I look forward to the day when all this drm bullshit is behind us Where I can buy movies on usb sticks.

332
00:22:58,391 --> 00:23:00,500
Scott: Yeah, uh, you just I would just buy movies download.

333
00:23:00,801 --> 00:23:04,840
Scott: It'd be kind of like steam where there's a list of every movie i've ever bought and they just click and they play.

334
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:08,840
Scott: Oh, i'd be willing to pay but I can also download them in a non-drm format.

335
00:23:10,381 --> 00:23:14,400
Rym: I'm not gonna pay a dollar a song which is the reason I don't use itunes a dollar a song forget it.

336
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:21,420
Rym: But even with I mean if there were no drm and it was like five to ten cents a song I would spend thousands of dollars on music.

337
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,042
Rym: There was.

338
00:23:22,062 --> 00:23:26,896
Scott: there was a study that said that the sweet spot for music prices online is five cents.

339
00:23:27,257 --> 00:23:34,372
Scott: if it was five cents I would just go online and like type in the name of like The doors and click buy everything they've ever done.

340
00:23:34,814 --> 00:23:36,140
Scott: beatles buy everything they've ever done.

341
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:36,563
Scott: Let's have them.

342
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:37,047
Scott: buy everything.

343
00:23:37,107 --> 00:23:38,820
Scott: even though I own some cds same with anime.

344
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:48,800
Rym: Like if I see a box set of a show that I kind of liked for 40 bucks or less I'll probably just buy it because it's so cheap and if nothing else i'll give it away as a prize on GeekNights.

345
00:23:49,101 --> 00:23:50,004
Scott: So this is just but.

346
00:23:50,225 --> 00:23:57,919
Rym: but if I give a show away as a prize that i've already seen Aren't I hurting the industry because that person didn't buy those dvds?

347
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:09,060
Scott: I think this just proves that if your only customers are Rym and Scott that yet again You can't blame us for not buying it's their fault for not making the price the correct price determined by capitalism.

348
00:24:09,401 --> 00:24:15,390
Scott: I watch so much lower now that netflix is make more money from people like us And that's it.

349
00:24:15,631 --> 00:24:15,893
Rym: All right.

350
00:24:16,094 --> 00:24:16,717
Rym: I think we're done.

351
00:24:16,939 --> 00:24:20,620
Rym: Yep So once again, this was not a normal episode of GeekNights.

352
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,789
Rym: This was in fact a GeekNights special.

353
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:31,600
Rym: if you're a new listener, and I know there are a lot of you Listen to any episode that does not have the special tag or in is in the special category.

354
00:24:32,042 --> 00:24:34,580
Rym: You'll get a much more sense of what our show is about.

355
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:41,025
Scott: It's not just scott ranting and me laughing while he rants and if you don't support GeekNights with charitable donations You're a bad person.

356
00:24:41,085 --> 00:24:42,190
Rym: Yeah, send us five bucks.

357
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:43,456
Rym: So we're not doing the show anymore.

358
00:24:43,476 --> 00:24:44,320
Scott: Yeah, just kidding.
