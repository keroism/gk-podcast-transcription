1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,220
Rym: It's Tuesday, April 9th, 2019.

2
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,262
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,322 --> 00:00:13,844
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,964 --> 00:00:15,147
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,187 --> 00:00:21,605
Rym: We are back from convention season and now we're on our regularly scheduled nonsense for the foreseeable future.

6
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:24,888
Rym: and tonight we are talking about Baba is you.

7
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,108
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:30,201
Rym: So I'm coming home to do the show.

9
00:00:30,262 --> 00:00:30,725
Rym: Scott's already here.

10
00:00:30,745 --> 00:00:31,590
Scott: And the seven train is broken?

11
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:32,815
Rym: Yeah, that's not my ad.

12
00:00:33,498 --> 00:00:35,930
Rym: The seven train being broken would not be worthy.

13
00:00:36,071 --> 00:00:38,424
Scott: I was gonna say that better not be your lame-o opening.

14
00:00:38,585 --> 00:00:39,510
Rym: Unless I broke it.

15
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,552
Rym: Okay, then it would be if I broke the seven train I think it would be worthy.

16
00:00:43,573 --> 00:00:45,299
Scott: Or you saw someone break it at least.

17
00:00:45,319 --> 00:00:51,650
Rym: If I knew, like if I witnessed its breakage even then it would have to be a noteworthy breakage, but I don't know.

18
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:52,915
Rym: So I'm in Grand Central.

19
00:00:52,955 --> 00:01:04,830
Rym: I'm getting ready to go down to the seven train and deal with all that and there's usually people in Grand Central like playing music and busking and like there's a permit system where like anyone can do it.

20
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:07,289
Scott: Well, there's official ones and non-official ones.

21
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:20,037
Rym: Yeah, but the non-official ones are very well tolerated and usually in the morning there's a sad old guy playing a melodica and he's clearly trying to learn how to play the melodica and he's getting better and better every day over the last like six months.

22
00:01:20,057 --> 00:01:20,961
Scott: Oh, he's actually trying.

23
00:01:20,981 --> 00:01:23,110
Scott: He's not one of those toot toot toot.

24
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:30,370
Rym: He was playing the Godfather theme like over and over and over again but then he moved on to another song and now he's got like five or six things he can play.

25
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:30,992
Scott: All right.

26
00:01:31,012 --> 00:01:31,796
Rym: So I'm kind of like.

27
00:01:31,917 --> 00:01:32,701
Rym: I'm proud of that dude.

28
00:01:32,721 --> 00:01:34,250
Rym: Like I'm glad he's progressing.

29
00:01:34,491 --> 00:01:35,033
Scott: Yeah, those are.

30
00:01:35,074 --> 00:01:36,078
Scott: there's some certain songs.

31
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:37,323
Scott: Godfather theme is one of them.

32
00:01:37,343 --> 00:01:39,357
Scott: that like New York, New York it's like that.

33
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:46,390
Scott: that's you know not good buskers will try to learn like the main part of and play on repeat to get tourist money.

34
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:56,150
Rym: Yeah, because it needs to be have a long enough refrain that someone will recognize but won't be there or won't stand around long enough to hear you repeat the same thing over and over again because you never learn the rest of the song.

35
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,397
Rym: Like you learn that first bit of stairway.

36
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:59,269
Scott: And you can play it slowly and emotionally.

37
00:01:59,631 --> 00:02:06,610
Rym: Yeah, but there's certain genres of music that you tend to hear in the New York City subway.

38
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:13,225
Rym: It's usually some sort of Showtime thing like an individual person singing really loudly over some like boombox.

39
00:02:13,305 --> 00:02:14,850
Rym: Like there's certain kinds of music you expect to hear.

40
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,077
Scott: Yeah, there's certain genres you don't hear.

41
00:02:17,097 --> 00:02:20,910
Scott: You don't hear my favorite genres like EDM, metal.

42
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:21,611
Scott: Yeah.

43
00:02:21,631 --> 00:02:23,190
Scott: You don't hear any of those in the subway.

44
00:02:23,871 --> 00:02:27,250
Rym: So I heard a genre of music on the way home today in the subway.

45
00:02:27,834 --> 00:02:30,450
Rym: I have never encountered down there before.

46
00:02:31,031 --> 00:02:32,235
Scott: What, John?

47
00:02:32,255 --> 00:02:34,784
Scott: Your favorite electro swing in the subway now?

48
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:39,624
Rym: So you know in like an old Scooby-Doo thing.

49
00:02:39,865 --> 00:02:43,375
Rym: So first off, you know pipe organ music.

50
00:02:43,976 --> 00:02:51,335
Rym: But then there's the variant of pipe organ music that's done with kind of crappy Hammond sounding synths in like the 70s.

51
00:02:51,596 --> 00:02:55,050
Rym: that's often used as the background music in like a Scooby-Doo episode.

52
00:02:55,451 --> 00:03:00,670
Rym: Like scary organ music with like a weird beat like that kind of thing.

53
00:03:01,933 --> 00:03:03,570
Rym: Someone was just fucking playing that.

54
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,710
Scott: They just had Hammond organ in the subway or an electric keyboard?

55
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:20,016
Rym: It was an electric keyboard set up to sound like that and they had like a backbeat and a drummer and it was basically like a remixed version of scary Scooby-Doo organ music with a beat.

56
00:03:20,418 --> 00:03:24,250
Rym: and I had never heard anything like it before in the New York City subway.

57
00:03:24,712 --> 00:03:28,130
Rym: And I actually stopped to listen to it for four seconds.

58
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,073
Rym: Well, yeah.

59
00:03:30,134 --> 00:03:34,110
Rym: I stood there for four seconds and be like, wait, that's just spooky organ music.

60
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:35,963
Rym: Who plays spooky organ music in the subway?

61
00:03:35,984 --> 00:03:36,286
Rym: Whatever.

62
00:03:36,306 --> 00:03:36,609
Rym: I gotta go.

63
00:03:38,391 --> 00:03:39,276
Rym: So that was interesting.

64
00:03:39,497 --> 00:03:42,170
Rym: If that ever happens again, I will stop and get a cell phone video.

65
00:03:43,893 --> 00:03:44,740
Rym: So we just dive right in.

66
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,163
Rym: We're back.

67
00:03:45,203 --> 00:03:45,970
Rym: Do gig nights again?

68
00:03:46,352 --> 00:03:47,750
Scott: Yeah, I want to go eat food at my house.

69
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:48,231
Rym: Oh, yeah.

70
00:03:48,512 --> 00:03:53,150
Rym: So we were, as you know, at PAX East and PAX East is the end of our convention season.

71
00:03:53,752 --> 00:03:55,637
Scott: Until PAX West in Labor Day.

72
00:03:55,698 --> 00:03:59,670
Scott: So all summer we're gonna enjoy weather and not enjoy being inside with nerds.

73
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:00,491
Rym: Yep.

74
00:04:00,511 --> 00:04:06,690
Rym: Now in the earliest earliest days of gig nights, we would spend entire episodes reviewing conventions, but it's 2019.

75
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:07,588
Rym: You know what PAX is.

76
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:16,478
Rym: So all I want to do is highlight the like the things that were different or notable about this PAX East because PAX East is pretty much the biggest PAX.

77
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,870
Scott: It's the same as it was last time mostly.

78
00:04:19,271 --> 00:04:21,017
Rym: Yeah, though a problem.

79
00:04:21,038 --> 00:04:27,364
Rym: we noticed that we were positing before this PAX that we're like we're worried that this is going to be a trend and I don't know what to do about it.

80
00:04:27,686 --> 00:04:28,530
Rym: And it did continue.

81
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:40,390
Rym: PAX is, particularly PAX East, not so much PAX West, but PAX East have an interesting problem now where when the Expo Hall closes, the majority of the people in the building just leave.

82
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:47,610
Rym: So it gets really quiet at night, which used to not be the case at PAX East.

83
00:04:47,831 --> 00:04:53,170
Scott: Tabletop at night, which is always full because that's the place to go when the Expo Hall closes.

84
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:53,710
Rym: Yep.

85
00:04:54,112 --> 00:05:01,714
Rym: But basically I get this impression that all the people who buy single day badges are the kinds of people who tend to come primarily for the Expo Hall.

86
00:05:02,095 --> 00:05:09,756
Rym: And I definitely saw an uptick in people, despite PAX trying to like tell them that there is stuff happening after 6 p.m.

87
00:05:10,197 --> 00:05:15,350
Rym: and that this whole building is theirs, people still seem to primarily leave.

88
00:05:16,473 --> 00:05:23,230
Scott: I mean, if you look on, you know, like PAX communities online, which are there's no single one, there's a bunch of disparate ones.

89
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,990
Rym: The Reddit has like no traffic.

90
00:05:25,311 --> 00:05:27,110
Scott: Yeah, well, it has some, but it doesn't have a ton.

91
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:30,410
Scott: As always, people coming in talking about like PAX vaporizers for their weed.

92
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:31,234
Scott: Yeah.

93
00:05:31,254 --> 00:05:33,370
Scott: There's a brand of vaporizers, PAX, I guess.

94
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,890
Scott: I don't know if the Firefly is a better one.

95
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:35,551
Scott: I don't know.

96
00:05:35,973 --> 00:05:41,550
Scott: Anyway, the point is, people in there are, you know, there seem to be like camps in there.

97
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:45,510
Scott: And the biggest, there's always threads like PAX swag hunters.

98
00:05:45,872 --> 00:05:49,170
Scott: And it's like this people, they're going to PAX specifically for swag.

99
00:05:49,471 --> 00:05:55,590
Scott: When I say what's wrong with you, you materialist, consumerist, shallow human being, they're like, you know, don't hate.

100
00:05:56,091 --> 00:05:58,010
Scott: I'm allowed to like collecting useless swag.

101
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:58,873
Scott: And that's what I like.

102
00:05:58,913 --> 00:06:04,910
Scott: And I'm saying, yeah, but I'm just still going to hate on you for it anyway, because you're a consumerist, shallow, materialist person.

103
00:06:05,312 --> 00:06:05,877
Scott: And that's bad.

104
00:06:05,897 --> 00:06:07,489
Scott: That's not a good thing to aspire to be.

105
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:11,710
Rym: There was a time in my life when I wanted two things out of the world.

106
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:15,649
Rym: I wanted swords and I wanted plastic anime things.

107
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:21,810
Rym: And the only reason I do not have a lot of those things is because I didn't have money at that time.

108
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,249
Rym: So I don't fault people that joy.

109
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:36,489
Rym: The only problem it causes is that there are a lot of people who want to go to things like PAX for the entire weekend to experience PAX like we do, like playing tabletop and go to console gaming and like do stuff.

110
00:06:37,033 --> 00:06:39,210
Rym: They're not going to go unless they can go for the whole weekend.

111
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,490
Rym: But there's a limited number of people who can get into the building.

112
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:47,290
Rym: And now that PAX is all have only single day badges, Saturday sells out.

113
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:53,730
Rym: And people who would otherwise be those people who go to PAX every year and do what we do, if they can't get Saturday, they just won't go.

114
00:06:54,410 --> 00:07:02,390
Scott: The main problem I'm seeing is just a more general thing in that people come, PAX is really big and people come for a lot of disparate reasons.

115
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,670
Rym: Which should be good.

116
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,650
Rym: It's a merging of all these gaming cultures.

117
00:07:05,871 --> 00:07:08,890
Scott: You know, at other big conventions, that's also the case, right?

118
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:17,950
Scott: There are people who go to, say, San Diego Comic-Con just to see like preview trailers for movies that aren't out yet or people go to manifest just to get ripped.

119
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:22,010
Scott: There are people who go to Gen Con just to play like this one.

120
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:26,370
Scott: They play like one competitive game, say like X-Wing, and they're going just to play a whole bunch of X-Wing.

121
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:26,630
Scott: Right.

122
00:07:26,992 --> 00:07:32,030
Scott: But the problem is when those people go to those other conventions, you know, that guy goes to Gen Con just to play Warhammer.

123
00:07:32,213 --> 00:07:33,250
Scott: Better example, right?

124
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:36,390
Scott: They get their fill of just Warhammer at Gen Con.

125
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:37,450
Scott: They don't have any complaints.

126
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:41,230
Scott: They can fill their whole weekend with Warhammer and they're good.

127
00:07:41,471 --> 00:07:43,870
Scott: They don't care if the rest of Gen Con is servicing someone else.

128
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,910
Scott: That's how it works, right?

129
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:48,149
Scott: Even though Gen Con has issues, I'm not talking about those right now.

130
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:54,170
Scott: When you come to PAX, I think the problem is that PAX serves all these different audiences to varying degrees.

131
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:59,845
Scott: I think that whichever audience you are part of, whichever community you're part of.

132
00:07:59,885 --> 00:08:01,330
Scott: that comes to PAX for a reason.

133
00:08:02,551 --> 00:08:09,910
Scott: It is not necessarily fully servicing, even though it's providing service to all the communities, it's not providing full service.

134
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:15,850
Scott: So every single different community that comes to PAX from every different angle has at least one thing to complain about.

135
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:17,032
Scott: Right.

136
00:08:17,273 --> 00:08:22,010
Scott: The swag people complain about something that they don't like, you know, it's like I was waiting in a line.

137
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:26,350
Scott: You know, I love waiting in lines, you know, to play games even before they're out.

138
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,308
Scott: They just love it.

139
00:08:27,571 --> 00:08:32,110
Scott: They're like, it was bullshit because the exhibitor let a streamer cut everyone in line.

140
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:32,852
Scott: Right.

141
00:08:32,871 --> 00:08:34,030
Scott: They're mad about something, right?

142
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:41,409
Scott: The, you know, it's like no matter which part of PAX is yours, there's something that everyone's complaining about, you know, in each different place.

143
00:08:41,591 --> 00:08:45,590
Scott: And they got to fix all those things in each different place to make all the different communities happy.

144
00:08:45,951 --> 00:08:50,450
Rym: Or choose not to fix them and not worry about that community because PAX will sell out regardless.

145
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:51,969
Scott: I think a bigger problem.

146
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:52,892
Scott: But it didn't.

147
00:08:52,912 --> 00:08:56,470
Scott: It didn't sell out Thursday or Sunday, only Friday and Saturday.

148
00:08:57,052 --> 00:09:02,070
Rym: So, yeah, the real problem is like the things we'll complain about.

149
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:10,190
Rym: But this is an opposite complaint or a negative complaint in the sense that it's great for me, but it sucks for PAX and it sucks for the exhibitors.

150
00:09:10,972 --> 00:09:12,930
Rym: People don't really go to PAX East on Thursday.

151
00:09:13,292 --> 00:09:15,170
Rym: No, there was like no one there.

152
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:20,470
Scott: The logic was, you know, the original logic was like, hey, PAX three days, we have three days of PAX.

153
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:21,334
Scott: They all sell out.

154
00:09:21,636 --> 00:09:23,889
Scott: We want more people to be able to go and enjoy PAX.

155
00:09:24,372 --> 00:09:28,110
Scott: So we'll sell single day badges and we will add another day.

156
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:34,170
Scott: Yeah, but the kinds of more total human, different, unique human beings can come and experience PAX.

157
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:43,209
Scott: And I guess they've achieved that goal because every, you know, unique human being who can get to PAX and wants to experience it can get a ticket because it didn't sell out.

158
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:51,110
Rym: But they can get a Saturday ticket and the kind of person who wants to go to PAX for one day probably does not want to take Thursday off work.

159
00:09:51,471 --> 00:09:52,052
Scott: Well, that's the thing.

160
00:09:52,132 --> 00:09:59,970
Scott: It worked at PAX West because the fourth day it was, you could take the, you know, you take off work Friday one day, but then the rest of PAX is Saturday, Sunday, Labor Day.

161
00:10:00,292 --> 00:10:01,790
Scott: That fourth day works at East.

162
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,447
Scott: The fourth day does not work.

163
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:09,350
Scott: It'd be better swapping East if they can't do this probably because they're locked in for quite a while.

164
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:14,289
Scott: Swap East with South's dates because South has Martin Luther King Day on the Monday.

165
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:15,291
Scott: Right.

166
00:10:15,392 --> 00:10:17,910
Scott: The South isn't even using that fourth day on the Monday.

167
00:10:18,473 --> 00:10:18,634
Scott: Right.

168
00:10:18,675 --> 00:10:20,310
Scott: It's just a travel home from San Antonio.

169
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:22,169
Rym: I think South, you can still get three day badges.

170
00:10:22,771 --> 00:10:23,541
Scott: Yeah, maybe you can.

171
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:23,926
Scott: I don't know.

172
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:24,711
Scott: Right.

173
00:10:24,872 --> 00:10:27,190
Scott: But yeah, East that fourth day is a Thursday.

174
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:33,730
Rym: It's like, you know, I feel like there's a Thursday is a problem just because it's a call.

175
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:36,670
Rym: It probably cost PAX more than they make back from it.

176
00:10:36,711 --> 00:10:37,181
Rym: I don't know.

177
00:10:37,201 --> 00:10:37,283
Rym: Yeah.

178
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:41,590
Scott: Well, I mean, you know, the exhibitors are not, you know, the big exhibitors don't care.

179
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:41,852
Scott: Right.

180
00:10:41,872 --> 00:10:43,689
Scott: The extra day doesn't cost them that much extra.

181
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:50,840
Scott: But the small exhibitors I know have I've heard more than one small exhibitor has complained to me that they don't like the PAX.

182
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:58,430
Scott: East has Thursday because they now have to pay, you know, 33 whatever percent more money to be there that fourth day.

183
00:10:58,932 --> 00:11:02,630
Scott: And there's no one there on Thursday who's not there on Friday, Saturday or Sunday.

184
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,169
Scott: It's all community people mostly.

185
00:11:04,571 --> 00:11:05,013
Scott: Yeah.

186
00:11:05,194 --> 00:11:05,475
Rym: Right.

187
00:11:05,555 --> 00:11:08,570
Rym: Or the lifers, the people who would buy a four day badge like us.

188
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:08,851
Scott: Right.

189
00:11:08,871 --> 00:11:11,170
Scott: It's like they're not getting really any extra eyeballs or sales.

190
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:14,730
Scott: They just lose money on that Thursday and hope to make it up Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

191
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:21,230
Scott: I think the solution to that specific problem is to do something more like what San Diego Comic-Con does.

192
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,770
Scott: And it's pretty rare that I would use them as a good example.

193
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:27,910
Scott: But their first day is actually Wednesday night and they call it preview night.

194
00:11:28,311 --> 00:11:29,275
Scott: And it's like you can own.

195
00:11:29,315 --> 00:11:33,130
Scott: they sell a limited number of badges and only some things are open on that night.

196
00:11:33,513 --> 00:11:35,770
Scott: And it's like a special time.

197
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:36,552
Scott: Right.

198
00:11:37,094 --> 00:11:41,030
Scott: And that's what I think PAX East should do with Thursday is they should open PAX.

199
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:44,250
Scott: Thursday late, like maybe five p.m.

200
00:11:44,512 --> 00:11:46,389
Scott: or something like four or something like that.

201
00:11:46,891 --> 00:11:47,092
Scott: Right.

202
00:11:47,132 --> 00:11:51,810
Scott: And only have it go until like nine or ten, maybe like a five or six hour deal.

203
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:58,110
Scott: And only sell a limited number of Thursday badges, maybe equal to the number they sold that are still in the green.

204
00:11:58,574 --> 00:11:58,776
Scott: Right.

205
00:11:58,817 --> 00:11:59,789
Scott: A few thousand or so.

206
00:12:00,292 --> 00:12:03,569
Scott: And then it's like you come in, only certain things are on.

207
00:12:03,951 --> 00:12:04,152
Scott: Right.

208
00:12:04,172 --> 00:12:07,710
Scott: There's only certain expo booths that are open, only the big ones, maybe.

209
00:12:08,052 --> 00:12:11,570
Scott: And it's like, look, you can come in, you know, you get a special Thursday badge.

210
00:12:11,812 --> 00:12:13,790
Scott: There hopefully won't be crazy lines.

211
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:19,790
Scott: You can do some things like maybe go to the Nintendo booth that had a long line and then not have to do it Friday, Saturday.

212
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:24,930
Rym: So I like the other idea you had of have an area of the expo hall that's not open during the day.

213
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,942
Scott: Well, that's a different idea.

214
00:12:27,962 --> 00:12:29,610
Scott: That's not an idea to solve this problem.

215
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:30,460
Scott: No, that's just another.

216
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,250
Scott: that's just a cool idea.

217
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:31,550
Scott: Yeah.

218
00:12:31,571 --> 00:12:33,599
Rym: Well, it gets to the broader issue of I feel like there's just.

219
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:36,030
Scott: this is an adding new cool ideas enough.

220
00:12:36,171 --> 00:12:36,773
Rym: Yeah.

221
00:12:36,834 --> 00:12:40,430
Scott: Tabletop is innovating with its first look and such, but other areas, not so much.

222
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:46,130
Rym: So on one hand, there's people like us and the kinds of people who tend to go to tabletop and like console areas.

223
00:12:46,251 --> 00:12:48,749
Rym: And actually, like their main goal at PAX is to play games.

224
00:12:49,371 --> 00:12:51,630
Rym: They want PAX to be as many days as possible.

225
00:12:51,991 --> 00:12:57,610
Rym: They want to just buy a badge to all of the days and they want to just go to the same PAX every year.

226
00:12:58,151 --> 00:13:05,030
Rym: But then you have this opposite need where the exhibitors would they want as many human beings to walk by their booth as possible.

227
00:13:05,431 --> 00:13:10,750
Rym: Anyone who's at PAX more than one day wasted a spot that they could have made more money or gotten more views from.

228
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:19,270
Rym: And then this third tug of war are the people who only want to go to PAX for one community thing or one specific aspect of PAX.

229
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:25,990
Rym: Like that year where there was the that there was a sports tournament at PAX and a lot of people got badges just to go.

230
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,910
Scott: There were several sports things at PAX this year.

231
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:31,070
Scott: Top level is the Smash Brothers North American World Championship.

232
00:13:31,532 --> 00:13:32,215
Scott: There was a huge.

233
00:13:32,255 --> 00:13:35,330
Scott: the biggest one, I think, was the Magic Arena thing.

234
00:13:35,751 --> 00:13:36,858
Scott: There were lots of top.

235
00:13:37,099 --> 00:13:38,990
Scott: it was for the Magic Online Arena thing.

236
00:13:39,793 --> 00:13:41,889
Scott: And they revealed a new expansion for that.

237
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:46,430
Scott: And there were top level streamers and players all competing in that.

238
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:48,790
Scott: A streamer I know came in like third place or something.

239
00:13:49,393 --> 00:13:51,770
Scott: It was like, you know, it was way, way big deal.

240
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:53,008
Scott: That thing was huge.

241
00:13:53,651 --> 00:13:56,629
Rym: All that aside, there's I think the worst aspect of PAX.

242
00:13:57,231 --> 00:14:08,790
Rym: They're like, this was the biggest problem we had this year was that in one of the e-sport tournaments areas, there was a brief moment where some people were playing ice hockey and yes, ice hockey.

243
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:11,030
Rym: And it was very unfortunate.

244
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:25,730
Rym: I mean, a little facetious here that the person who was the official emcee, like announcing this thing, apparently had never heard of this sport of hockey and literally had no idea what was going on and proceeded to embarrass himself on stage.

245
00:14:25,972 --> 00:14:27,649
Scott: He embarrassed himself only to us.

246
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:30,030
Rym: Yeah, no one in the crowd seemed to notice either.

247
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,030
Scott: He didn't seem embarrassed.

248
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,350
Rym: Yeah, he wasn't embarrassed.

249
00:14:32,691 --> 00:14:33,276
Rym: He didn't know.

250
00:14:33,659 --> 00:14:34,830
Rym: most of the crowd didn't know.

251
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:35,630
Scott: Should have been embarrassed.

252
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:39,610
Rym: As he kept talking about halftime and was confused about how hockey worked.

253
00:14:39,971 --> 00:14:42,190
Rym: And the poor players didn't really know how the game worked either.

254
00:14:42,731 --> 00:14:45,029
Scott: Yeah, you got to tell the people how it works before you make them play it.

255
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:47,650
Rym: Or just make them play it, but know how the game works.

256
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,550
Rym: Like, know one thing about hockey.

257
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:51,570
Rym: Yeah, anyway, I guess they knew one thing.

258
00:14:51,632 --> 00:14:52,230
Rym: It's called hockey.

259
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,307
Rym: You didn't know anything else about hockey.

260
00:14:54,031 --> 00:14:54,628
Scott: He's illiterate.

261
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:55,950
Rym: But yeah, don't don't get us wrong.

262
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,309
Scott: Read the name of the game on the game.

263
00:14:57,491 --> 00:14:59,549
Rym: This was my favorite PAX East ever.

264
00:15:00,281 --> 00:15:00,446
Scott: Oh, OK.

265
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,748
Rym: I think mostly because it was warm out.

266
00:15:03,595 --> 00:15:04,270
Scott: That was that helped.

267
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:04,987
Rym: That helped a lot.

268
00:15:05,552 --> 00:15:07,110
Rym: And I only we only did one panels.

269
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,110
Rym: We had a really light schedule.

270
00:15:08,271 --> 00:15:10,228
Rym: So I spent a lot of time just playing games.

271
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:17,330
Rym: But the real problem with PAX is that the security theater is getting way out of control.

272
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,250
Scott: We won't talk about it.

273
00:15:18,414 --> 00:15:18,728
Scott: It's not news.

274
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,169
Scott: We've been talking about every PAX.

275
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:20,550
Rym: I will.

276
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,288
Rym: It was way worse this year.

277
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,550
Rym: The security lines were bad.

278
00:15:24,871 --> 00:15:27,310
Rym: Because they were actually checking bags most of the time.

279
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:31,570
Scott: Well, I think that's just a matter of it's not you know, it's like who you hire to work at the bag thing.

280
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:32,954
Scott: It's like some people who work at it.

281
00:15:32,994 --> 00:15:33,415
Scott: take it to.

282
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:38,810
Scott: there's two kinds of people who work, you know, bag check security at a private place like a convention center.

283
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:44,170
Scott: The kind of person who's just getting a job and they just doing the bare minimum to keep the job and get the money.

284
00:15:44,271 --> 00:15:45,189
Scott: It doesn't actually care.

285
00:15:45,551 --> 00:15:51,390
Scott: And then the person who's on like some kind of power trip and believes they're keeping everyone safe is going to root through every possible thing.

286
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,469
Scott: It doesn't care about how slow the line is.

287
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,130
Rym: I would.

288
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:59,010
Scott: But it's got to the point to where if you're going to have security theater and you know it's theater, you shouldn't hire the second kind of person.

289
00:15:59,331 --> 00:16:04,850
Rym: If I was not able to use the exhibitor entrances to PAX East, I would not go to PAX East.

290
00:16:05,054 --> 00:16:05,309
Scott: I agree.

291
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:12,030
Rym: I would literally skip going to PAX East if I couldn't continue to use the exhibitor entrance because that line you can't get in.

292
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:16,890
Rym: There were panels people were doing at the beginning near the beginning of PAX where no one could get in to see them.

293
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:22,850
Scott: So that magic thing I was talking about, the big the big magic arena e-sport thing.

294
00:16:23,151 --> 00:16:30,030
Scott: So the actual reveal of the expansion and the finale of the tournament was on Sunday morning because someone had asked me about it the previous day.

295
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:30,690
Scott: Like, when is it?

296
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:34,190
Scott: I'm like, oh, it's because they had like their own mega booth, which is like one of the biggest booths.

297
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:36,670
Scott: And they use that for their tournament the whole weekend.

298
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:40,110
Scott: But then on Sunday, they moved to the PAX arena for the finale and the reveal.

299
00:16:40,731 --> 00:16:44,810
Scott: So it was in the PAX arena, like at 10, 10, 30.

300
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:49,890
Scott: As soon as basically as soon as PAX started, they started that thing and the whole seating area of the PAX arena was full.

301
00:16:50,573 --> 00:16:52,509
Scott: But the rest of the convention was pretty much empty.

302
00:16:53,114 --> 00:16:55,570
Scott: People were outside struggling to get into the building.

303
00:16:56,030 --> 00:17:02,910
Scott: Dude, I had every other area was quiet when I was there looking at that full arena area.

304
00:17:03,191 --> 00:17:09,470
Scott: So it's like people were desperate to go to that, lined up early, got and filled in while most of the people were still not in the building.

305
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:14,409
Rym: Yeah, I remember tabletop opened and there was no one in tabletop playing games because no one could get there.

306
00:17:14,698 --> 00:17:14,887
Scott: Yep.

307
00:17:16,032 --> 00:17:17,049
Rym: But it was a good PAX.

308
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:19,930
Rym: So we'll talk about a lot of the stuff we saw at PAX over the next few weeks.

309
00:17:21,132 --> 00:17:23,569
Rym: One thing that was announced at PAX East, it's big news.

310
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:24,829
Rym: Borderlands 3 is coming.

311
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:28,510
Scott: I didn't even play Borderlands 2 and I didn't finish Borderlands 1.

312
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:32,430
Rym: I think the Borderlands 3 announcement thing was the only thing that filled the main theater.

313
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:36,409
Scott: Like as much as people talk about... People were hoping for swag, right?

314
00:17:36,731 --> 00:17:36,954
Rym: Yeah.

315
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:38,050
Rym: And I think there was swag.

316
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:43,670
Rym: But I actually heard that, like, the presenters messed up and like couldn't actually present much of anything.

317
00:17:44,151 --> 00:17:48,310
Scott: Oh yeah, I heard that it was actually like a disaster that could even show their trailer or anything.

318
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:53,010
Rym: Yeah, but I get the impression that PAX was in no way at fault with these problems.

319
00:17:53,450 --> 00:18:06,910
Scott: I still do not understand the desire to physically be in the room during, basically, an advertisement or a press... It's like, you know, even if I had the option to like go to the press conferences of like my favorite sports teams, why would I go?

320
00:18:07,233 --> 00:18:08,850
Scott: I was more... I could just watch them on Twitter.

321
00:18:09,571 --> 00:18:16,272
Rym: I was more hyped about Civ 5 than I'd been about any game in like my modern life since maybe Team Fortress 2.

322
00:18:16,272 --> 00:18:22,250
Rym: And when I got to PAX, there was the big panel about it and there was the like the multi-hour line to play it.

323
00:18:22,611 --> 00:18:26,410
Rym: And I saw both of those things and said, you know what, I already preordered this game.

324
00:18:27,436 --> 00:18:28,290
Rym: I will just get it.

325
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:29,210
Scott: I do not understand.

326
00:18:29,451 --> 00:18:30,969
Scott: It's like, yeah, OK, you enjoy that.

327
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:31,633
Scott: But why?

328
00:18:32,217 --> 00:18:34,650
Scott: Why do you enjoy being physically in the room?

329
00:18:34,971 --> 00:18:39,890
Scott: It's not like it's a concert where hearing music live is a different experience than hearing music on Spotify.

330
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,729
Rym: I mean, sometimes the swag is worth it.

331
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:44,930
Rym: Like sometimes the swag is everybody gets a copy of the game.

332
00:18:45,011 --> 00:18:46,269
Rym: Like stuff like that does happen.

333
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:47,645
Scott: Yeah, maybe.

334
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:49,730
Rym: I mean, if I didn't have money, like that would be great.

335
00:18:50,931 --> 00:18:52,370
Scott: But usually the swag is one.

336
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,290
Scott: Rando gets a video card and everyone else gets nothing.

337
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:58,230
Rym: But yeah, like even Act Inc didn't completely fill the room, as far as I can tell.

338
00:18:58,493 --> 00:18:58,928
Scott: It's a big room.

339
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,170
Rym: Yeah, it is a pretty big room.

340
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:04,210
Rym: It's like thirty four ish thousand, depending on the configuration.

341
00:19:04,653 --> 00:19:05,490
Scott: Not thirty thousand.

342
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:07,390
Rym: No, three, four thousand thirty.

343
00:19:08,195 --> 00:19:08,808
Scott: I was like, hell no.

344
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,670
Rym: Well, I was about to say it's not a stadium.

345
00:19:10,811 --> 00:19:13,090
Rym: I was actually about to say thirty three hundred.

346
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:19,670
Rym: And then I backed it up because the number is different because full disclosure, not only do we exhibit, but we enforce.

347
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:24,590
Rym: And I enforce main theater and the number is different depending on how the room is configured.

348
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:30,130
Rym: And I got to know that number for every event that's in that room while I am an enforcer for that room.

349
00:19:30,234 --> 00:19:30,490
Scott: All right.

350
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:39,130
Scott: So another thing that happened recently, this is not the hugest news, but, you know, Nintendo has their Nintendo Switch online program, which I think is complete bullshit.

351
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:42,670
Scott: You pay twenty bucks a year, which is a low, low price for most services.

352
00:19:42,771 --> 00:19:44,590
Scott: I would be happy to pay twenty bucks a year, but I would.

353
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,469
Rym: But it's Nintendo.

354
00:19:45,793 --> 00:19:47,489
Scott: Here's what you get for your twenty bucks a year.

355
00:19:47,772 --> 00:19:47,995
Scott: Right.

356
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,410
Scott: I think it's twenty bucks a year.

357
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:51,530
Scott: Anyway, this is what you get.

358
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,830
Scott: You get to play your switch games online.

359
00:19:54,071 --> 00:19:59,870
Scott: So like you could you can't play Smash Brothers online unless you pay twenty bucks or whatever it is, plus one for PC gaming.

360
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:03,170
Scott: You can't play Mario Tennis online unless you pay for the thing.

361
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:03,571
Scott: Right.

362
00:20:03,892 --> 00:20:07,720
Scott: The second thing that you get is you get this app that will let you.

363
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,010
Scott: basically it's an NES emulator that has a limited selection of games from the NES.

364
00:20:12,691 --> 00:20:14,149
Scott: And they keep adding more games to it.

365
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,820
Scott: And it actually includes.

366
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,090
Scott: it's actually a pretty good emulator.

367
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:20,309
Scott: You can play the games on your switch, which is real nice.

368
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:23,970
Scott: And it lets you do save states and other emulator type things.

369
00:20:24,411 --> 00:20:30,690
Scott: And it also gives you remixed versions of the games that will let you like, you know, because they're really hard.

370
00:20:31,552 --> 00:20:34,270
Scott: Like there's one that like I forget which one it was.

371
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:36,510
Scott: It is like it just put me at the boss, basically.

372
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,110
Scott: I was like, oh, oh, it was Kirby's Adventure.

373
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:44,630
Scott: I opened up the there's regular Kirby's Adventure, but then there's a separate one that was Kirby's Adventure with like a logo on it.

374
00:20:45,072 --> 00:20:47,425
Scott: And when I open that one, it's like I'm at King Dedede there.

375
00:20:48,571 --> 00:20:49,119
Scott: There I am.

376
00:20:49,627 --> 00:20:49,830
Scott: Right.

377
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:50,374
Rym: That's fun.

378
00:20:50,617 --> 00:20:51,710
Scott: Yeah, it's a cool thing.

379
00:20:51,811 --> 00:20:51,972
Scott: Right.

380
00:20:52,194 --> 00:20:53,970
Scott: But it's not worth any amount of money.

381
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:58,350
Scott: And the other thing is that there is currently one exclusive game and there may be more in the future.

382
00:20:58,411 --> 00:21:00,531
Scott: And that is Tetris 99.

383
00:21:00,531 --> 00:21:05,010
Scott: So you can only pay Tetris 99 if it's free as long as you pay for the service.

384
00:21:05,591 --> 00:21:12,350
Scott: So I wouldn't mind paying for the service if the library of games was much, much bigger.

385
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:12,811
Scott: Right.

386
00:21:12,972 --> 00:21:15,210
Scott: Imagine paying like for Netflix and there's like one movie.

387
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:26,690
Rym: Well, more importantly, I wouldn't want to pay for a service like this unless like matchmaking and finding people to play with was an A plus experience, because I get this for free on every PC game.

388
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:27,211
Scott: Right.

389
00:21:27,231 --> 00:21:27,332
Scott: Yeah.

390
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:29,810
Scott: The playing online should be free in principle.

391
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,550
Scott: Charging for that is complete bullshit.

392
00:21:31,651 --> 00:21:33,229
Scott: Unless it's a class experience.

393
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:36,670
Scott: I know that Xbox and PlayStation also charge for their online whatevers.

394
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:38,448
Scott: And that's also a bullshit on the PC.

395
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:44,430
Scott: I don't have to pay extra like steam subscription fee to be able to play, you know, a Counter-Strike online.

396
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:45,418
Scott: I buy Counter-Strike.

397
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:46,610
Scott: playing online is now free.

398
00:21:46,832 --> 00:21:47,055
Scott: Yep.

399
00:21:47,318 --> 00:21:47,500
Scott: Right.

400
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,228
Scott: That's how it should be.

401
00:21:48,571 --> 00:21:51,390
Scott: It's bullshit that a console wants to charge you for a service for that.

402
00:21:51,871 --> 00:22:02,850
Scott: But I actually really want to pay for a Netflix like library of games, as long as it is an enormous library that can compete with my library of emulated ROMs.

403
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:09,230
Scott: So give me every NES game ever, every SNES game, every N64 game, every GameCube game.

404
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,115
Scott: Just give me all of them.

405
00:22:10,498 --> 00:22:12,129
Scott: I'll pay you 20 bucks a month.

406
00:22:12,891 --> 00:22:14,188
Scott: I'll pay 30 bucks a month.

407
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:14,991
Scott: Right.

408
00:22:15,273 --> 00:22:17,309
Scott: But right now it is not worth paying for.

409
00:22:17,551 --> 00:22:21,330
Scott: But it is very much worth getting for zero dollars.

410
00:22:21,671 --> 00:22:22,828
Rym: And guess what you can do?

411
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,250
Scott: You can get it for zero dollars.

412
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:32,110
Scott: Well, sort of zero dollars if you already pay the large amount of money that may or may not be worth it, depending on your circumstances for Amazon Prime.

413
00:22:32,973 --> 00:22:34,589
Scott: And you get a Twitch account for free.

414
00:22:34,992 --> 00:22:37,830
Scott: You can then click some buttons to connect your Prime and Twitch accounts.

415
00:22:38,412 --> 00:22:38,613
Scott: Right.

416
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:41,009
Scott: The Prime one being non free, the Twitch one being free.

417
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:43,390
Scott: Now we're assuming that combining them is also free.

418
00:22:43,651 --> 00:22:45,150
Scott: You get now have a Twitch Prime account.

419
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:50,450
Scott: You can use the Twitch Prime account to get three months of Nintendo Switch online for free.

420
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:55,750
Scott: But then if you wait a little bit of time after you get that three month free subscription.

421
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:56,887
Scott: Right at the end.

422
00:22:57,151 --> 00:22:57,314
Scott: Right.

423
00:22:57,396 --> 00:22:58,029
Scott: So, well, no.

424
00:22:58,551 --> 00:22:59,744
Rym: It says available after 60 days.

425
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:01,349
Scott: Three months is 90 days.

426
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:02,903
Scott: So you get 90 days free.

427
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:11,270
Scott: But then after 60 days, you can come back to the website and click another button and that will give you nine more free months for a total of 12 free months.

428
00:23:12,172 --> 00:23:15,190
Scott: But basically that's included with your non free Twitch Prime.

429
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:15,872
Rym: Yep.

430
00:23:15,892 --> 00:23:18,610
Rym: Which hopefully you're getting free from Amazon already.

431
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:22,450
Scott: The trick is this automatically enables automatic renewal.

432
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:30,929
Scott: So after the end of that second nine months or first 90 days, if you don't come back to get your nine more free months, they're going to take your money to give you the year paid.

433
00:23:31,531 --> 00:23:38,510
Scott: So you have to go into your settings on Nintendo's website, your account settings and disable the free renewal, which you can do immediately.

434
00:23:38,591 --> 00:23:40,270
Scott: You don't need to like wait to do it later.

435
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:51,010
Scott: And remember, you can come click the link for the three months, immediately go to Nintendo's website, turn off automatic renewal, then set a reminder for 60 days to come back and click the link for nine more months.

436
00:23:51,611 --> 00:23:55,330
Scott: And then you've got your free year of Nintendo online, which is worth it.

437
00:23:55,792 --> 00:23:56,438
Scott: Don't pay for it.

438
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,550
Scott: It is not yet worth it.

439
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:58,488
Scott: Probably won't be worth it.

440
00:23:58,910 --> 00:23:58,970
Rym: Yep.

441
00:23:59,653 --> 00:24:03,830
Rym: So the only thing I'm going to do with this probably is play Tetris 99.

442
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:04,509
Scott: Well, I'm going to play.

443
00:24:04,831 --> 00:24:08,349
Scott: I already played Tetris 99 and I've played some emulated games on there a little bit.

444
00:24:08,871 --> 00:24:15,430
Scott: But I plan to check in with it if and when within at least the first year they release other things.

445
00:24:16,357 --> 00:24:16,746
Scott: But that's it.

446
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:19,930
Rym: So really brief geek bite in the first look area at PAX.

447
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:23,510
Rym: I played a bunch of games and there was one that really stood out.

448
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:24,930
Rym: It's not available in the U.S.

449
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:27,069
Rym: yet, so I'm just going to wait to get it.

450
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,469
Rym: But Crown of Imara.

451
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:29,091
Rym: Right.

452
00:24:29,132 --> 00:24:30,447
Scott: So it's pretty much a Euro game.

453
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:31,769
Rym: But here is the deal.

454
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:36,909
Rym: It is it's a worker placement game, but instead of worker placement, it's got fucking Rondell's.

455
00:24:37,411 --> 00:24:41,750
Scott: So there are two Rondell's, two Rondell's, two Rondell's with four spaces each.

456
00:24:42,252 --> 00:24:45,090
Scott: And you can only play on one Rondell or the other each turn.

457
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:48,250
Scott: And you can only move your guy one, two or three spaces.

458
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:50,150
Scott: You can't go all the way around and repeat the same action.

459
00:24:50,591 --> 00:24:55,410
Scott: So basically you have six actions to choose from on any given turn out of eight.

460
00:24:55,991 --> 00:24:56,253
Scott: Right.

461
00:24:56,414 --> 00:24:59,030
Scott: And things combo into each other in interesting ways.

462
00:24:59,574 --> 00:25:00,790
Scott: And you can't really block anyone.

463
00:25:00,851 --> 00:25:01,990
Scott: They can land on whatever spot.

464
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:02,251
Scott: Yep.

465
00:25:02,291 --> 00:25:10,090
Rym: But the primary mechanic, because the big problem with worker placement games is that usually the games devolve to political blocking.

466
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:13,290
Rym: The games devolve to optimal blocking.

467
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:15,490
Rym: Like getting baby is literally the only thing that matters.

468
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:16,509
Rym: Like everyone get baby.

469
00:25:16,971 --> 00:25:19,829
Rym: They come down to get more workers is the way to win.

470
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:20,711
Rym: Yep.

471
00:25:20,732 --> 00:25:28,290
Rym: Crown of Imara solves this by having I don't want to get too deep into the details because we'll review it on its own episode, but it has randomness.

472
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:30,610
Rym: But the randomness is all Puerto Rico style.

473
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:40,310
Rym: It's all things that will set the stage for the players to try to solve the way to optimize the configuration of this board.

474
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:44,850
Scott: I always just refer to this as same army, different territory, different terrain.

475
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:47,250
Scott: Everyone starts the game with the same army every time.

476
00:25:47,311 --> 00:25:48,509
Scott: But the terrain is different every game.

477
00:25:49,071 --> 00:25:49,372
Scott: Yep.

478
00:25:49,493 --> 00:25:56,910
Rym: But the other thing it does other than the two Rondells is that there's a bunch of paths to victory and they all we I played this game twice already.

479
00:25:56,971 --> 00:25:58,510
Rym: They all seem pretty legit.

480
00:25:58,932 --> 00:25:59,615
Scott: Yeah, that is the.

481
00:25:59,716 --> 00:26:08,489
Scott: I think the defining thing that makes this game great is that a lot of board games out there have multiple victory paths and usually one of them is vastly superior to the others.

482
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:08,971
Scott: Yeah.

483
00:26:08,991 --> 00:26:12,650
Scott: And whoever dominates on that path will beat people using the other paths.

484
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:13,954
Scott: Right.

485
00:26:14,596 --> 00:26:18,533
Scott: Yet this game, there are many passes like you can see on the board there's a bread way to win.

486
00:26:18,553 --> 00:26:22,110
Rym: There's a book way to win with bread one game because no one else did bread.

487
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,750
Rym: Actually, I won every game of this I played.

488
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:26,050
Scott: But but did you win with bread every time?

489
00:26:26,311 --> 00:26:35,970
Rym: I won with bread the first time someone else tried to do my bread and I went a different way and I won with basically doing medium on everything and it worked just fine.

490
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,790
Scott: There's so many ways to win, which is pretty cool.

491
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:38,270
Rym: Yeah.

492
00:26:38,572 --> 00:26:50,312
Rym: But the other main thing about it is that rather than blocking, what happens is actions on the board either do a certain amount, like get you a thing or or like cost a certain amount.

493
00:26:50,834 --> 00:26:55,989
Rym: Every time someone does these things, the cost goes up or the effectiveness goes down.

494
00:26:56,631 --> 00:27:00,070
Rym: So you're always rewarded for getting something ahead of other people.

495
00:27:00,551 --> 00:27:06,629
Rym: You can still do it if you come later, but it sucks a little bit and it sucks more and more the later you get to the party.

496
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:07,451
Scott: Yeah.

497
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:13,315
Rym: So you're kind of always choosing between optimizing your engine or getting somewhere first.

498
00:27:13,556 --> 00:27:17,070
Rym: So I get those bread points and now Scott is going to get far fewer bread points.

499
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:17,290
Scott: Yeah.

500
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:24,089
Scott: Do I cash in two bread for four each or do I get more bread first and cash them in for three each because someone else is going to go get the bread for four each first?

501
00:27:24,612 --> 00:27:28,317
Rym: But anyway, my high level geek bite, because I do not want to get into the details, is that we just did.

502
00:27:28,802 --> 00:27:29,449
Rym: No, I did not.

503
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:35,550
Rym: Crown of Amara is a standout game that is going to be good and worth buying.

504
00:27:37,131 --> 00:27:42,950
Rym: The other game that we play that I want to briefly geek bite Smartphone Incorporated, I think it was a Kickstarter game.

505
00:27:43,451 --> 00:27:46,409
Rym: It's it looks like a Kickstarter game, at least I'll say that.

506
00:27:48,011 --> 00:27:53,716
Rym: It's a game about like making a machine to sell cell phone, manufacture and sell cell phones in different regions.

507
00:27:54,561 --> 00:27:56,010
Rym: We played it.

508
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:57,013
Rym: I played it twice.

509
00:27:57,334 --> 00:28:08,690
Rym: We played it with different numbers of players and the game had one hundred percent devolved into a fixed strategy and guaranteed victory for a player in a particular position.

510
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:10,269
Scott: It appeared to be a very broken game.

511
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:18,010
Rym: Then we discovered that because the rules are not that well written, we and almost everyone who played at a PAX was playing it completely wrong.

512
00:28:18,351 --> 00:28:18,552
Scott: Yep.

513
00:28:19,354 --> 00:28:21,220
Rym: And it's possible.

514
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:28,509
Scott: it is good with the right rules, but we don't know what the right rules are because they're written so poorly and I can't even get a correction on VGG.

515
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:32,110
Scott: We think we know what the right rule is, but we're not one hundred percent.

516
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:32,902
Scott: We're only like 90 percent.

517
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:43,570
Rym: I think if the rules are what we think, there is a possibility of a good game here because there is a mechanic of do you raise your price or lower your price?

518
00:28:43,932 --> 00:28:47,150
Rym: And if you have lower prices, you can sell more phones and get in early.

519
00:28:47,614 --> 00:28:49,370
Rym: But you could raise your price.

520
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:53,369
Rym: And there's a whole thing there that feels like it would be really fun if it worked.

521
00:28:54,271 --> 00:28:56,750
Rym: But I've never seen a game pull this off where it works.

522
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:00,310
Rym: This one might work, but no one taught us how to play the game the correct way.

523
00:29:00,611 --> 00:29:05,653
Rym: So we'll have to play it with the rules correctly to understand if that mechanic works or not.

524
00:29:05,934 --> 00:29:08,890
Rym: So this is either ground floor or groundbreaking.

525
00:29:10,991 --> 00:29:16,969
Rym: And the last news before we get into the main bit, we didn't talk about this before the but this was a big gaming news.

526
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:20,350
Rym: Yu-Gi-Oh has a large and thriving tournament scene.

527
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,100
Scott: Really still.

528
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:21,630
Scott: Yeah.

529
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:26,410
Scott: I did see some people playing it at PAX, but actually I saw mostly root and second game.

530
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,330
Scott: The game I saw second most was actually Key Forge.

531
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:28,775
Scott: Right.

532
00:29:28,938 --> 00:29:29,570
Scott: Very surprising.

533
00:29:30,031 --> 00:29:30,292
Rym: Yeah.

534
00:29:30,332 --> 00:29:35,587
Rym: We got to go back in because I played Key Forge and it was fun, but like not enough for me to engage with.

535
00:29:36,371 --> 00:29:43,950
Rym: But a lot of people were playing Key Forge at PAX, like to the point that all of us were like, wow, a lot of Key Forge going on here.

536
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:44,689
Scott: Yeah, pretty good.

537
00:29:45,792 --> 00:29:47,050
Rym: But Yu-Gi-Oh, I saw some Yu-Gi-Oh.

538
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:47,792
Rym: Yu-Gi-Oh is big.

539
00:29:48,193 --> 00:29:54,251
Rym: Yu-Gi-Oh has made a major change to the tournament rules for their tournaments.

540
00:29:56,638 --> 00:30:01,450
Rym: So there's a new subsection, Subsection I, Hygiene.

541
00:30:02,933 --> 00:30:03,730
Rym: What has changed?

542
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:10,810
Rym: This is a new section requiring all persons attending a tournament to be clean and wear clean clothing.

543
00:30:12,355 --> 00:30:13,049
Rym: What does this mean?

544
00:30:13,692 --> 00:30:22,450
Rym: If you or your clothing is excessively dirty or bad smelling, you can be penalized, meaning you could be ejected from the tournament.

545
00:30:22,952 --> 00:30:26,010
Rym: You could be forced to forfeit around to try to correct the problem.

546
00:30:26,372 --> 00:30:29,649
Rym: You could just be penalized in the context of that game.

547
00:30:31,592 --> 00:30:34,990
Rym: This is an amazing rule, and the community is obviously split.

548
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:37,190
Rym: Half of the community, well, maybe not half.

549
00:30:37,531 --> 00:30:45,210
Rym: Online, a section of the community is saying that this is unfair to the pros, which says a lot about that community.

550
00:30:46,331 --> 00:30:50,169
Rym: And the other half of the community has said, thank God, banished to the shower zone.

551
00:30:51,514 --> 00:30:52,830
Scott: So, yes, good rule.

552
00:30:53,070 --> 00:31:02,151
Scott: But as often comes up in these discussions, someone always brings up the case that, like, yeah, there's some people who have a medical biological thing that just makes them smell bad.

553
00:31:02,171 --> 00:31:02,557
Scott: Right.

554
00:31:03,912 --> 00:31:05,610
Scott: Is there an exception for those people?

555
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:13,469
Scott: And also, even though I've heard people discussing that biological phenomena that some people just smell bad, there's nothing they can do to help it.

556
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,508
Scott: I've never heard a name for it.

557
00:31:16,033 --> 00:31:17,989
Scott: I've never seen a case of it.

558
00:31:18,151 --> 00:31:19,169
Scott: I'm not denying it.

559
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:34,290
Scott: Well, I'm just saying, will somebody please send me a link that explains the specific medical thing and the conditions by which someone's DNA or something about them makes them naturally smell bad and deodorant and showers will not solve it.

560
00:31:34,814 --> 00:31:36,248
Scott: I want to see an explanation of it.

561
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:37,192
Scott: Right.

562
00:31:37,212 --> 00:31:39,470
Scott: Because that would be good to learn about the next time this comes up.

563
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:41,570
Scott: I would actually be able to say something better about.

564
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:53,632
Rym: Now, what's interesting is that the rule is pretty clear about it's dirt and like you have to be clean and your clothes have to be clean because, frankly, every time I've encountered a B.O.

565
00:31:53,672 --> 00:32:00,970
Rym: at a con, it is either because someone does not wash themselves or because those jeans have never seen the inside of a washing machine.

566
00:32:03,012 --> 00:32:11,592
Rym: So I'm pretty sure that situation would be handled appropriately, and I'm pretty sure the vast majority of the people who will be affected by this rule will not have an excuse.

567
00:32:11,813 --> 00:32:24,930
Scott: I mean, I can't someone who does have this problem, you know, if it exists, which because I imagine that person is showering and deodorizing diligently to try to fight, try to help their problem.

568
00:32:25,072 --> 00:32:25,314
Scott: Right.

569
00:32:25,537 --> 00:32:26,730
Scott: Maybe applying perfumes.

570
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:31,910
Rym: God, imagine being the judge of the Yu-Gi-Oh tournament, who has to determine if this is a medical odor.

571
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:35,531
Scott: I imagine if it was medical, you'd have some sort of form to prove that you had a thing.

572
00:32:35,571 --> 00:32:35,712
Scott: Right.

573
00:32:35,732 --> 00:32:35,913
Scott: Yeah.

574
00:32:36,053 --> 00:32:46,230
Scott: Well, also, most of the time, the smell is I imagine that that person is going to, even though they have this problem, is going to smell a lot better than someone who is clear.

575
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:46,531
Scott: Right.

576
00:32:46,551 --> 00:32:48,549
Scott: If someone just smells really, really bad.

577
00:32:49,511 --> 00:32:49,874
Scott: You're right.

578
00:32:49,975 --> 00:32:51,566
Scott: It's clear that they're not even right.

579
00:32:52,752 --> 00:32:53,114
Rym: Yeah.

580
00:32:53,455 --> 00:32:58,834
Rym: So it'll be interesting because if you saw my tweet a while ago about ranking the sources of B.O.

581
00:32:58,874 --> 00:33:02,124
Rym: at conventions at PAX's, the B.O.

582
00:33:02,184 --> 00:33:04,772
Rym: is primarily confined to three areas.

583
00:33:04,832 --> 00:33:10,913
Rym: In my experience, area one is the GameCube area where Smash Brothers Game Cube is being played.

584
00:33:11,335 --> 00:33:15,910
Rym: Area two is collectible card game tournaments and area three is the expo hall.

585
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:18,104
Scott: I walked around a lot of collectible card game tournaments.

586
00:33:18,164 --> 00:33:19,090
Scott: I didn't smell too many.

587
00:33:19,312 --> 00:33:21,090
Rym: I encountered it twice.

588
00:33:21,491 --> 00:33:26,605
Scott: And the expo hall, it was never like a big problem, but it would be there would be like individuals.

589
00:33:26,666 --> 00:33:26,909
Scott: Yes.

590
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:34,390
Scott: And it was sort of like when you're playing a video game and you're in that stealth zone, we have to get from like one spot to another through a hedge maze.

591
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:36,970
Rym: And you pass through a zone of fart control.

592
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:40,010
Scott: And there's guards who are like looking around and you're trying to dodge them.

593
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:43,175
Scott: That's what you walk through the expo hall and it's like perfectly fine, perfectly fine, perfectly fine.

594
00:33:43,577 --> 00:33:45,610
Scott: I am in the radius of a bad smelling person.

595
00:33:47,095 --> 00:33:48,110
Scott: OK, I'm out of the radius.

596
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:52,190
Scott: They're only like maybe like 10 or 20 of them in the whole expo hall.

597
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:53,250
Rym: But I'm saying it's rare.

598
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:54,769
Rym: Pax does not have a B.O.

599
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:57,069
Rym: problem like a lot of other conventions do.

600
00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:00,090
Rym: Yeah, but it does still happen occasionally.

601
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:00,693
Scott: Oh, yeah.

602
00:34:00,834 --> 00:34:03,130
Scott: I ran into at least five instances, maybe.

603
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:03,471
Rym: Yep.

604
00:34:03,774 --> 00:34:05,590
Rym: Almost all the instances I ran into were in the expo hall.

605
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:06,810
Scott: But they were all like brief encounters.

606
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:10,570
Scott: It was like someone smells bad nearby and walk, walk, walk, walk, walk.

607
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:11,203
Scott: OK, I'm good.

608
00:34:11,346 --> 00:34:11,449
Rym: Yep.

609
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:20,270
Rym: It's not like when you go to a smaller con where there's like the tabletop room and the entire room is just a desolate ruin.

610
00:34:26,552 --> 00:34:28,710
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

611
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:31,270
Rym: So as you guys know, I like to ski.

612
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:36,473
Rym: But another thing that I used to do a lot, but I don't really do any more often is mountain bike.

613
00:34:36,976 --> 00:34:39,187
Rym: And I started to realize that I'm a pretty good mountain biker.

614
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:41,668
Scott: Throw yourself down a hill dangerously.

615
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:44,070
Rym: Or just trail riding, which is not down a hill.

616
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:46,389
Rym: It's sideways, but on a really narrow track to the woods.

617
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:49,040
Rym: So I'm going to link to a video that like this is.

618
00:34:49,201 --> 00:34:53,530
Rym: I found someone else and this is about the level of mountain biking that I am at.

619
00:34:53,751 --> 00:34:55,050
Rym: Like this is what I enjoy doing.

620
00:34:55,531 --> 00:34:57,389
Rym: This video is the kind of thing that I like to do.

621
00:34:58,071 --> 00:34:59,870
Rym: But there's another kind of mountain biking.

622
00:35:00,712 --> 00:35:03,109
Rym: And I found a video that explains this thing.

623
00:35:04,731 --> 00:35:09,750
Rym: There is this thing, this feature in Sedona, Arizona, called the white line.

624
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:13,949
Rym: And mountain bikers talk about it like it's this crazy thing you need to do.

625
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:16,549
Rym: It's like a fun thing to do.

626
00:35:17,232 --> 00:35:19,280
Rym: So I watched this video where someone explains.

627
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,449
Rym: the video is called the white line.

628
00:35:21,489 --> 00:35:27,250
Scott: trail is sketchy and deadly skull emoji that looks based on the still image I'm looking at.

629
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:28,177
Rym: I agree.

630
00:35:28,401 --> 00:35:28,970
Rym: Oh, it's even worse.

631
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:29,989
Rym: You look at this still image.

632
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:34,932
Rym: And as a mountain biker, I look at this and think that doesn't look that hard because it doesn't.

633
00:35:35,012 --> 00:35:40,710
Scott: I mean, I definitely could imagine, you know, I see people do like free climbs with no ropes or anything like straight, flat cliffs.

634
00:35:40,871 --> 00:35:41,031
Scott: Right.

635
00:35:41,312 --> 00:35:46,635
Scott: So I can definitely imagine there are, you know, very good athletes, extreme type people who could do this.

636
00:35:46,675 --> 00:35:50,274
Scott: Some of them will die or get seriously injured, but many of them will make it.

637
00:35:50,395 --> 00:35:52,729
Scott: I imagine it's basically just who can do this.

638
00:35:53,051 --> 00:35:58,690
Rym: So this video talks about something that I never thought about because I don't really watch videos of people mountain biking that often.

639
00:35:59,251 --> 00:36:11,369
Rym: Something that happens with mountain biking called the GoPro effect, where due to the wide angle lens, a GoPro video will often make a mountain biking thing look way less steep or dangerous than it actually is.

640
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:11,831
Scott: Correct.

641
00:36:12,153 --> 00:36:15,710
Rym: So this expert mountain biker went to check out this white line and do it.

642
00:36:16,551 --> 00:36:21,092
Rym: And he points out that, one, if you look at it from a different angle, fuck that bullshit.

643
00:36:22,476 --> 00:36:32,150
Rym: And two, he points out that this style of mountain biking isn't actually that interesting or that fun, nor does anyone care if you successfully do it.

644
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:32,753
Scott: You're basically.

645
00:36:32,873 --> 00:36:37,096
Scott: it looks like you're just going straight sideways, slow and careful along.

646
00:36:37,277 --> 00:36:39,290
Scott: So the steepness is to your left and right.

647
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:41,830
Scott: It's like perpendicular to your to your where you're going.

648
00:36:42,232 --> 00:36:43,699
Scott: So it's really just a matter of.

649
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,567
Scott: it's more like tightrope walking a bicycle.

650
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:48,149
Scott: It's more like a trapeze thing than a bike thing.

651
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:52,270
Rym: So he basically said, imagine do the part of mountain biking that's the least fun.

652
00:36:52,853 --> 00:36:54,530
Rym: And if you succeed, no one gives a shit.

653
00:36:54,872 --> 00:36:58,050
Rym: And if you make even one tiny mistake, well, I mean, you're getting a bruise.

654
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:58,752
Rym: You shouldn't.

655
00:36:58,772 --> 00:37:02,390
Scott: you shouldn't be doing things because how much shit people give about it.

656
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:02,791
Scott: Yeah.

657
00:37:03,193 --> 00:37:13,460
Scott: But if I was going to do something like this, I've seen people like use wooden planks to make like very narrow paths, like over swimming pools and things like that and stuff like that.

658
00:37:13,501 --> 00:37:14,050
Rym: That stuff's fun.

659
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:14,635
Scott: And it's like.

660
00:37:14,898 --> 00:37:16,169
Scott: that is basically the same as this.

661
00:37:16,411 --> 00:37:21,634
Scott: Only probably more challenging because you can make all sorts of elevation changes and angle turns.

662
00:37:21,654 --> 00:37:25,834
Rym: But also if you fail, like you mess up like, cool, you fell in the pool and everyone laughs at you.

663
00:37:26,095 --> 00:37:29,050
Scott: But he talks about at one point, if you mess up this, you die.

664
00:37:29,251 --> 00:37:39,669
Rym: The most dangerous part of this ride is a boring standard mountain biking maneuver where you do a 180 down a little steep thing like, well, not a full 180, but you basically go down and make a hard, hard turn.

665
00:37:39,932 --> 00:37:41,650
Rym: Yeah, that's like a standard mountain biking thing.

666
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:47,572
Rym: It's easy to mess up like I mess that up kind of often, but you shouldn't mess it up that often.

667
00:37:48,115 --> 00:37:49,683
Rym: And when you mess it up, you get a bruise.

668
00:37:49,784 --> 00:37:50,950
Rym: usually like you fall off your bike.

669
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:51,788
Rym: You go, ah, shit.

670
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:58,750
Scott: Yeah, but it's the kind of thing where, you know, a pro is going to get it ninety nine times out of one hundred, but still fail one time out of one hundred.

671
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:05,329
Rym: And if you fail at this maneuver, you die in front of all the people who like to stand and watch idiots trying to do this trail.

672
00:38:06,112 --> 00:38:08,370
Scott: Yeah, the moral is how many people are at the bottom dead.

673
00:38:08,731 --> 00:38:11,649
Rym: So supposedly no one has died doing it yet.

674
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:14,089
Scott: How many people have been severely injured trying to do this?

675
00:38:15,213 --> 00:38:16,630
Rym: So people don't seem to know.

676
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:18,949
Rym: They don't seem to be stats because it's not an official trail.

677
00:38:19,511 --> 00:38:22,370
Rym: There's no like official body that organizes anything on this thing.

678
00:38:22,875 --> 00:38:23,970
Scott: That makes it even more dangerous.

679
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:25,569
Scott: There's no nearby medical services.

680
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:26,171
Scott: Yep.

681
00:38:26,854 --> 00:38:29,526
Rym: So I just thought this was an interesting look into idiots.

682
00:38:30,531 --> 00:38:30,773
Rym: Yes.

683
00:38:30,873 --> 00:38:34,150
Rym: And also the difference between like mountain biking is a dangerous hobby.

684
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:36,749
Rym: One video is the part that I find fun.

685
00:38:37,111 --> 00:38:45,450
Rym: And one video is something that I would never, ever do, even though the second video is probably technically easier mountain biking than the first video.

686
00:38:45,772 --> 00:38:48,110
Rym: But if I make a mistake in the second video, I would literally die.

687
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:48,554
Scott: All right.

688
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,290
Scott: So what do you got?

689
00:38:49,731 --> 00:38:58,011
Scott: So, you know, when you go to dry your hands after washing your hands, which you do very often to avoid packs packs like I did because I dry, I washed and dried my hands many times.

690
00:38:58,574 --> 00:39:07,912
Scott: They say that paper towel is the most sanitary way, but I'm not a fan of the paper towel personally, even though I phrase someone who is the day and that's what they say.

691
00:39:07,932 --> 00:39:08,676
Scott: The Internet.

692
00:39:08,696 --> 00:39:14,250
Scott: There was some study or something that was like when you use the blowy kind of blows the water and felt all over the place.

693
00:39:14,593 --> 00:39:16,170
Scott: Yeah, but it also reduces bacterial.

694
00:39:16,511 --> 00:39:17,390
Rym: I feel like anyway.

695
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:27,390
Scott: Yeah, I prefer regardless of how sanitary or not it is the hot hand dryer because I don't have to touch too many things.

696
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:34,790
Scott: I don't have to throw paper towels in the garbage and I stand there long enough that it gets my hands one hundred percent dry.

697
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:39,310
Rym: Most people feeling a hundred percent dry complain about air dryers in bathrooms.

698
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:45,196
Rym: Either it's an air dryer from like the 90s or they think it's going to dry their hands in two seconds.

699
00:39:45,237 --> 00:39:46,410
Rym: And when it doesn't, they walk away.

700
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:48,829
Scott: You got to stand there and you got to keep rubbing and keep dry.

701
00:39:49,252 --> 00:39:49,579
Scott: Don't rub.

702
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:50,048
Scott: Don't rub.

703
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:50,652
Scott: I rub.

704
00:39:50,915 --> 00:39:52,267
Scott: You're rubbing stuff.

705
00:39:53,072 --> 00:39:56,490
Rym: I can definitely say rubbing spreads more bacteria around your hands.

706
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:56,973
Scott: Whatever.

707
00:39:57,054 --> 00:39:59,329
Scott: I just want my hands to feel a hundred percent dry.

708
00:39:59,991 --> 00:40:01,449
Rym: I prefer the Dyson air blade.

709
00:40:02,252 --> 00:40:02,817
Rym: It's all right.

710
00:40:02,857 --> 00:40:04,330
Rym: Twenty seconds to doing this and I'm good.

711
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:06,509
Scott: I like the hot ones better because nice and toasty.

712
00:40:07,332 --> 00:40:07,974
Scott: I like things hot.

713
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:15,110
Scott: Anyway, here in the video, we have a different brand of hair dryer, which is most excellent.

714
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:18,130
Scott: I have never check out not hairdryer hand dryer.

715
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:19,686
Rym: I've never encountered the airwolf one.

716
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:22,610
Scott: Check out this most excellent thing of the day.

717
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:24,868
Scott: Worthy hot air hand dryer.

718
00:40:25,251 --> 00:40:29,692
Rym: All I'll say is that Scott made me watch this video to determine if it was thing of the day worthy.

719
00:40:30,154 --> 00:40:35,255
Rym: And I reacted to it in a way that proved that it is definitely thing of the day worthy.

720
00:40:35,397 --> 00:40:36,669
Rym: OK, it's good.

721
00:40:37,153 --> 00:40:39,350
Rym: In the meta moment, we were at PAX East.

722
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:47,329
Rym: We got nothing, no conventions, no nothing except fun times until September with PAX West, which we will definitely be at.

723
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:48,113
Rym: Right.

724
00:40:48,134 --> 00:40:49,400
Rym: So wait for.

725
00:40:49,661 --> 00:40:51,390
Rym: we're going to judge some anime by its cover.

726
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:52,950
Rym: We're going to make some antenna videos.

727
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:59,010
Scott: Yet again, the schedules of things have aligned in such a way that we were not able to judge the anime right before the season started.

728
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:01,030
Scott: We have to wait until just after the season started.

729
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:01,454
Scott: Guess what?

730
00:41:01,474 --> 00:41:02,649
Scott: A new anime season just started.

731
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:02,992
Scott: Yep.

732
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,329
Rym: So we'll be doing that.

733
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:06,290
Rym: Some antenna videos we're going to be making.

734
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:08,070
Rym: I'm going to stream the rest of Wargroove.

735
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:12,692
Rym: All that content that doesn't happen during convention season is starting up with gusto.

736
00:41:13,097 --> 00:41:14,088
Scott: I'm going to bike and go to the beach.

737
00:41:14,851 --> 00:41:15,394
Rym: Yeah.

738
00:41:15,414 --> 00:41:18,730
Rym: Sometimes it'll rain and then we'll both edit video and make self share.

739
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:19,155
Rym: It'll rain.

740
00:41:19,216 --> 00:41:20,030
Rym: It'll rain occasionally.

741
00:41:20,993 --> 00:41:21,659
Rym: You know, we could do.

742
00:41:21,821 --> 00:41:22,810
Rym: we could record a podcast.

743
00:41:23,012 --> 00:41:23,637
Rym: At the beach.

744
00:41:24,141 --> 00:41:25,149
Scott: Yeah, it's on the Marantz.

745
00:41:26,014 --> 00:41:26,074
Rym: OK.

746
00:41:26,094 --> 00:41:28,409
Rym: You know, that's not going to happen, but I can say that we might do it.

747
00:41:29,311 --> 00:41:33,730
Rym: Also, I have video of not the panel we just did at PAX East.

748
00:41:34,111 --> 00:41:35,015
Rym: That'll be coming up soon.

749
00:41:35,416 --> 00:41:39,776
Rym: But one of the panels we did at Magfest that we haven't done anywhere else yet.

750
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:42,030
Rym: I actually edited and got all the video done.

751
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:45,528
Rym: It's online and I just got to do some YouTube stuff and you'll all be able to see it.

752
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:54,929
Rym: But our initial draft of Rare Game Mechanics, where we talk about Rondel's and Buddha Babell is going to be up on YouTube imminently.

753
00:41:56,231 --> 00:42:02,502
Rym: And last and least, well, maybe not least, the Ignites Book Club recently did 2001, A Space Odyssey.

754
00:42:02,523 --> 00:42:02,990
Scott: Yeah.

755
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:12,210
Scott: Have you selected the next book since it is your turn to select a piece of literature for us to both consume with our eyeballs?

756
00:42:12,731 --> 00:42:15,850
Rym: So we did the Odyssey, then we did a Space Odyssey.

757
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:18,308
Rym: I have chosen a book that is.

758
00:42:18,633 --> 00:42:19,269
Scott: Is it an Odyssey?

759
00:42:19,631 --> 00:42:32,790
Rym: It is adjacent to the Odyssey in the sense that instead of our friend Odysseus, we're ostensibly looking at our friend Theseus and perhaps a Minotaur and a Labyrinth.

760
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:35,110
Scott: However, I like a Minotaur and a Labyrinth.

761
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:39,750
Rym: So this book is widely regarded by nerds and people that I trust.

762
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:55,130
Rym: This is not just my opinion as being shockingly good, despite being a literal Dungeons and Dragons Planescape branded fucking book by Troy Denning, Pages of Pain set in the Dungeons and Dragons world of Planescape.

763
00:42:55,450 --> 00:43:07,250
Scott: This does not bode well because I read Timothy Zahn's Star Wars novels, the Thrawn trilogy, which were lauded as the best Star Wars novels, and they were at best mediocre.

764
00:43:08,011 --> 00:43:11,050
Scott: So will the best D&D novel be at best mediocre?

765
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:12,809
Scott: That is where my expectation level is.

766
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:14,850
Rym: I last read this book in high school.

767
00:43:15,696 --> 00:43:17,790
Scott: And I remember it being phenomenal.

768
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:21,690
Scott: Should I select a book I last read in high school that I remember being phenomenal?

769
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:25,490
Rym: That is not a bad way to go with the book club because we learn things about ourselves.

770
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:27,350
Scott: All those books are still in print or available.

771
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:34,970
Rym: But other people have said the same thing about this book, which is interesting.

772
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:38,699
Rym: And I don't want to spoil anything about it, but it is.

773
00:43:39,462 --> 00:43:44,390
Rym: ostensibly it explains where the Lady of Pain came from in Sigil.

774
00:43:44,671 --> 00:43:51,655
Scott: Well, I must warn you that my never open a game on my phone on the train, but always open the Kindle app instead.

775
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:56,568
Scott: plan has been going along much better than the last time I went through with this plan.

776
00:43:57,090 --> 00:44:01,110
Scott: I have already read a book and a half since finishing the book club books.

777
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:02,508
Scott: It's two and a half total books.

778
00:44:03,471 --> 00:44:10,349
Scott: And so once I finish the book that I'm currently reading, I will immediately proceed to read this book and the book club.

779
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:13,310
Scott: So, Scott, I'm going to read to the book of episode.

780
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:16,490
Scott: It'll be ready to go much sooner than ever in the past.

781
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:17,640
Rym: I'm just going to read to you.

782
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,570
Rym: the formal is short.

783
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:22,330
Rym: The description of this book like this is the cover, like the inside of the cover.

784
00:44:22,932 --> 00:44:23,729
Rym: The Lady of Pain.

785
00:44:24,332 --> 00:44:27,650
Rym: She rules the city of Sigil from behind a veil of perfect silence.

786
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:28,227
Scott: Or is it Sigil?

787
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:30,676
Rym: It is canonically.

788
00:44:30,837 --> 00:44:35,370
Rym: it is canonically Sigil because God is dead and that is a terrible canon.

789
00:44:36,312 --> 00:44:39,730
Rym: I pronounce it Sigil until someone corrected me and I found out that I was wrong.

790
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:40,261
Scott: Sigil?

791
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:41,149
Scott: Sigil?

792
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:42,209
Rym: Sigil.

793
00:44:44,771 --> 00:44:53,930
Rym: Feared by mortal and gods alike, she flays her worshippers alive and casts her foes into inescapable labyrinths of despair.

794
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:56,009
Rym: Only fools dare ask her to speak.

795
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:59,230
Rym: And an amnesian hero has come with the question.

796
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:01,230
Rym: Now, here's where you might get interested.

797
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:10,489
Rym: When the god Poseidon tells a man with no memory how to recover his past, the unwitting warrior seeks out the Lady of Pain.

798
00:45:11,411 --> 00:45:14,410
Scott: So basically, this sounds a lot like Planescape Torment.

799
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:17,870
Scott: Yeah, this book, some guy like wakes up.

800
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:22,430
Scott: He's like, he's like a guy wakes up with a guy in Planescape Torment, like a zombie or something.

801
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:22,950
Scott: I forget.

802
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:24,589
Scott: He's like some kind of not human.

803
00:45:25,110 --> 00:45:28,490
Scott: He wakes up, he wakes up similar to Planescape Torment.

804
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:33,127
Scott: He wakes up in some like torturey place in Planescape and then goes outside and is like, what the fuck?

805
00:45:33,631 --> 00:45:39,131
Rym: So basically, dude wakes up with amnesia and Poseidon says, yo, you want to get your memory back?

806
00:45:39,432 --> 00:45:46,689
Rym: Go ask the Lady of Pain, who lives in the city that gods cannot get to, what the deal is, and she'll totally help you out.

807
00:45:47,375 --> 00:45:48,010
Scott: I guess she doesn't.

808
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:52,634
Rym: The Lady of Pain is known mostly in this world for if anyone tries to worship her, she murders them.

809
00:45:52,957 --> 00:45:54,649
Rym: If anyone tries to talk to her, she murders them.

810
00:45:56,495 --> 00:45:57,890
Scott: So what is she doing then?

811
00:45:58,030 --> 00:45:59,129
Scott: Like, what's what's your life about?

812
00:45:59,693 --> 00:46:01,070
Rym: That is ostensibly what this book is about.

813
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:03,490
Scott: If you're not talking to anyone, why are you even doing just standing?

814
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:04,135
Scott: Are you just like?

815
00:46:04,175 --> 00:46:05,389
Scott: you might as well just be a statue then?

816
00:46:05,771 --> 00:46:08,290
Rym: So I checked out the reviews of this book on Amazon.

817
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:10,476
Rym: And there's a lot.

818
00:46:10,837 --> 00:46:13,610
Rym: it's got like four stars, like it's rated way higher than I expected.

819
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:22,250
Rym: I looked at the one star reviews and one of the reviews is someone complaining that the novel has a non reliable narrator and how that's unfair to the reader.

820
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:31,469
Rym: So and another one is someone who is super fucking butter that the book did not explain some lore that he cares about in the Planescape universe.

821
00:46:32,652 --> 00:46:36,461
Rym: So and all the good reviews are mostly people saying, wow, yeah, this book is way better than you expect.

822
00:46:36,563 --> 00:46:36,948
Rym: Oh, my God.

823
00:46:37,852 --> 00:46:38,809
Rym: So we'll see.

824
00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:43,250
Rym: Let's find out if a Rym when he was 16 has good taste or not.

825
00:46:44,834 --> 00:46:45,117
Scott: All right.

826
00:46:45,461 --> 00:46:46,270
Scott: Can we do the main bit now?

827
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:47,468
Rym: Baba is you.

828
00:46:47,830 --> 00:46:48,011
Scott: All right.

829
00:46:48,051 --> 00:46:54,650
Scott: So back quite a while ago, I was watching this on the AGDQ channel.

830
00:46:55,271 --> 00:47:05,850
Scott: They occasionally have these mystery races, which is basically it's called blind racing where you're doing a speed run, but it's a race situation where you're trying to speed run faster than the other people.

831
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:06,726
Scott: You start at the same time.

832
00:47:07,453 --> 00:47:10,010
Scott: But you've never seen this game before in your life.

833
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:11,370
Scott: It's like you're thrown into a game.

834
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:15,682
Scott: It's not like when you go to watch AGDQ, those people have practiced, learned everything about a game, right?

835
00:47:15,723 --> 00:47:16,250
Scott: They're the master.

836
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:18,870
Scott: This is here's the game you never played before.

837
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:19,979
Scott: There's two of you.

838
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:20,649
Scott: There's four of you.

839
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:23,550
Scott: Everyone play it now and see who beats it first.

840
00:47:24,093 --> 00:47:24,133
Scott: Go.

841
00:47:24,153 --> 00:47:24,375
Scott: All right.

842
00:47:24,839 --> 00:47:26,109
Scott: And it's really fun to watch these.

843
00:47:26,931 --> 00:47:30,470
Scott: And I when I was watching one of these, they played a game called Baba is you.

844
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:39,390
Scott: And most of the time, because they need to find games no one has played before, they're using weird, obscure indie games, game jam games, tiny little PC games.

845
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:43,532
Scott: It has to be PC games because, you know, everyone's sitting at a PC streaming or whatever.

846
00:47:43,592 --> 00:47:43,773
Scott: Right.

847
00:47:44,256 --> 00:47:46,750
Scott: So I saw Baba is you on there.

848
00:47:46,851 --> 00:47:49,710
Scott: And as soon as I saw it, I was like, that game is incredible.

849
00:47:50,772 --> 00:47:51,414
Scott: I must play it.

850
00:47:51,495 --> 00:48:02,230
Scott: And I found out that it was a game and made it a game jam by someone named Hempuli, H E M P U L I. You can get the original game jam build for free on itch.io.

851
00:48:02,692 --> 00:48:15,190
Scott: You can also get the full new version on itch.io, right, because after much time waiting, eventually they released a fully fleshed out implementation of this game that is much, much larger than that tiny game jam game.

852
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:19,830
Scott: They took that that core concept of amazingness, made a full game.

853
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:20,997
Scott: You can now buy it on steam.

854
00:48:21,037 --> 00:48:24,829
Scott: I bought it on steam immediately and I played a bunch of it, though I haven't beat it because it's hard.

855
00:48:25,812 --> 00:48:30,573
Rym: Now, I would recommend getting it on the switch because that's just a better form factor.

856
00:48:30,613 --> 00:48:32,269
Rym: I play it on the go a lot.

857
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:34,210
Scott: Whatever you want to buy it on, you buy it on.

858
00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:40,909
Scott: But, you know, I'm the kind of person who buys things on steam because if you haven't noticed, the Wii eShop is now gone.

859
00:48:41,593 --> 00:48:41,775
Scott: Yeah.

860
00:48:42,098 --> 00:48:43,210
Scott: Forget the Wii is dead.

861
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:45,149
Scott: The switch will one day also be dead.

862
00:48:45,451 --> 00:48:49,789
Scott: Yet the steam games that I purchased in 2004 are still available to me.

863
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:52,990
Rym: But the short version of our review could go away just as well.

864
00:48:53,151 --> 00:48:55,649
Scott: But I trust it more than I trust anything else.

865
00:48:55,890 --> 00:49:08,670
Rym: The TLDR version of this review is that Baba is You is unique, is groundbreaking, and they did way more than with this concept than you could possibly have expected.

866
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:09,071
Scott: Yes.

867
00:49:09,091 --> 00:49:10,790
Rym: So the game is so much bigger.

868
00:49:11,252 --> 00:49:14,770
Rym: If it had been a quarter as big, I would have been satisfied.

869
00:49:15,774 --> 00:49:17,589
Scott: So here's the concept of Baba is You.

870
00:49:18,012 --> 00:49:20,869
Scott: It's a. it's a block pushing puzzle game, just like Lolo.

871
00:49:21,313 --> 00:49:21,516
Rym: Yeah.

872
00:49:21,658 --> 00:49:22,350
Scott: Without that, without.

873
00:49:22,350 --> 00:49:22,632
Scott: All right.

874
00:49:22,954 --> 00:49:28,610
Scott: Just like you ever played Lolo, all you do is walk around a little square map, pushing things around in order to get to the exit.

875
00:49:28,810 --> 00:49:29,788
Rym: Those Lolo games are good games.

876
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:30,533
Scott: Right.

877
00:49:30,553 --> 00:49:31,277
Scott: Yeah.

878
00:49:31,398 --> 00:49:33,190
Scott: This is basically ultimate Lolo.

879
00:49:33,972 --> 00:49:35,589
Scott: The way it works is.

880
00:49:37,775 --> 00:49:38,689
Scott: How do I even explain it?

881
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:44,510
Scott: So imagine if the rules of the game are also pieces in the game, there is.

882
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:52,490
Rym: Oh, you said you started a board and it says like there's a block that says Baba, a block that says is in a block that says you and then there's a little Baba guy.

883
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:54,649
Rym: And because Baba is you, you can walk around.

884
00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:55,011
Scott: Yeah.

885
00:49:55,071 --> 00:50:00,012
Scott: So whatever is you is controlled by the up, down, left and right arrows on your keyboard.

886
00:50:00,072 --> 00:50:04,889
Scott: If nothing is you, then you can't move anything with the up, down, left and right arrows somewhere else.

887
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:06,129
Rym: It says flag is win.

888
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:10,350
Rym: So if Baba touches the flag and Baba is you, you win.

889
00:50:10,811 --> 00:50:14,530
Scott: Also, if Baba is you and Baba is win, you also win.

890
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:15,235
Scott: So you win.

891
00:50:15,558 --> 00:50:16,789
Scott: Basically, you're always trying to win.

892
00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:18,103
Scott: You're trying to make you win.

893
00:50:18,791 --> 00:50:20,370
Scott: You can't say you is win.

894
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:21,349
Scott: That won't make you win.

895
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:23,229
Scott: You has to be something.

896
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:26,830
Scott: Well, something has to be you and something has to be win.

897
00:50:27,010 --> 00:50:33,349
Scott: If those are the same, something you win or if those are two different somethings, but they're on the same space on the board, you win.

898
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:34,409
Scott: Those are the only two ways to win.

899
00:50:34,610 --> 00:50:34,710
Rym: Yep.

900
00:50:35,072 --> 00:50:51,790
Scott: No matter what kind of crazy stuff is going on on the map, whether it involves teleporting or ghosts or defeat or moving or any kind of craziness, keys, doors, that's the only way to win is to make something you and something win or make two different something's you and win.

901
00:50:51,871 --> 00:50:53,450
Scott: And then they're both occupying the same space.

902
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:54,949
Rym: Baba is Baba and has Baba.

903
00:50:55,390 --> 00:50:57,650
Scott: So there are nouns, right?

904
00:50:57,850 --> 00:51:03,090
Scott: Like Baba, Kiki, Key, Door, Wall, Ghost, Ghost.

905
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:14,689
Scott: And then there are like these descriptors win, defeat, you open, more, move, stop, more, push, all kinds of things like that.

906
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:15,975
Rym: Has been a fun one.

907
00:51:16,015 --> 00:51:22,810
Scott: And then there's the word is and there's the word has and then more words keep appearing that are sort of conjoining words.

908
00:51:23,291 --> 00:51:34,903
Scott: And if any, you know, subject block right is horizontally, basically you need a horizontal or vertical alignment orthogonally aligned right of subject.

909
00:51:35,645 --> 00:51:37,851
Scott: then has is whatever.

910
00:51:38,232 --> 00:51:46,010
Scott: and then descriptor Baba is you door has key wall is push anything like that.

911
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:50,996
Scott: And you can reuse the is because you can use the is vertically and horizontally at the same time.

912
00:51:51,016 --> 00:51:53,530
Scott: You can even you can reuse anything you could use, right?

913
00:51:53,590 --> 00:52:00,739
Scott: Because, you know, as long as there's room to push the blocks around, you can have one thing get used as an and you can be like you can like.

914
00:52:00,779 --> 00:52:05,957
Scott: thing is blank and blank now or right away, like you.

915
00:52:05,978 --> 00:52:11,952
Rym: just go to the website and look at these animated gifts that they just posted and you'll see exactly what the deal is with this game, like one hundred percent.

916
00:52:12,735 --> 00:52:17,789
Rym: The important the reason why this game is good, because this concept could be done very badly.

917
00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:20,290
Rym: Yeah, like I can easily see it being bad.

918
00:52:20,591 --> 00:52:26,573
Rym: The reason Baba is you is so utterly fantastic is that one, every combination does something.

919
00:52:27,518 --> 00:52:29,769
Rym: And if it's crazy, it's just crazy.

920
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:30,271
Scott: Yeah.

921
00:52:30,291 --> 00:52:31,909
Scott: I mean, right away, the wall is you.

922
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:32,191
Scott: Fuck.

923
00:52:32,273 --> 00:52:33,169
Rym: You're the walls now.

924
00:52:33,471 --> 00:52:34,193
Rym: Go for it.

925
00:52:34,493 --> 00:52:40,650
Scott: Every subject thing, Baba, wall, Kiki, pillar, cog, heart, key door.

926
00:52:40,770 --> 00:52:41,013
Scott: Yeah.

927
00:52:41,174 --> 00:52:42,750
Scott: Those are just describing graphics.

928
00:52:42,891 --> 00:52:45,949
Scott: There is no actual difference between a key and a Baba.

929
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:50,250
Scott: I can tell just things and they're only defined by what they are.

930
00:52:50,350 --> 00:52:58,312
Scott: If key is you and Baba is open, then the Baba's are just doors and the key is just you.

931
00:52:58,432 --> 00:53:02,729
Scott: You're just a key that you just look like a key, but you don't function like a key unless you are open.

932
00:53:03,191 --> 00:53:03,432
Rym: Yep.

933
00:53:03,814 --> 00:53:08,090
Rym: Like make key is more in this example and then the room just fills with keys.

934
00:53:08,231 --> 00:53:08,757
Rym: Now you're fucked.

935
00:53:09,588 --> 00:53:09,710
Scott: Yeah.

936
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:12,070
Scott: It's like, you know, you could be heart in one level.

937
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:12,797
Scott: It doesn't matter.

938
00:53:12,918 --> 00:53:14,150
Scott: Graphics are just graphics.

939
00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:16,950
Scott: You're the flag and grasses win.

940
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:19,790
Scott: You got to get the move the flag until it's on some grass.

941
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:20,432
Scott: Now you win.

942
00:53:20,814 --> 00:53:32,230
Rym: And the other reason the other thing that makes this game brilliant is that it is not in any way real time, which was where Lolo series started to get downhill because you had of timing and you had monsters and Lolo and fighting a little bit.

943
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:34,617
Scott: Barely, but it was still.

944
00:53:34,637 --> 00:53:35,019
Rym: the original.

945
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:38,768
Rym: Lolo's were just puzzles, but then they added some time components in this.

946
00:53:39,412 --> 00:53:41,990
Rym: You can hit a button to back up what you just did.

947
00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:43,950
Scott: One step all the way back to the beginning.

948
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:46,489
Scott: You can also have a full reset button to reset the whole level.

949
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:46,951
Rym: Yep.

950
00:53:47,293 --> 00:53:49,649
Rym: So you'll die a lot and just be like, no, back it up.

951
00:53:50,050 --> 00:53:52,710
Scott: Basically, when I play this game, what ends up happening is easy levels.

952
00:53:52,870 --> 00:53:57,448
Scott: I finish easily, but most levels I sit there and I experiment a little bit and I think about what I got to do.

953
00:53:57,670 --> 00:54:04,390
Scott: And then I just stare at it for like a long time and eventually come to either come to the answer or go to sleep and start again later.

954
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:06,458
Rym: I've got a few I have not solved that.

955
00:54:06,539 --> 00:54:08,410
Rym: I backed off and went to other areas.

956
00:54:08,590 --> 00:54:09,470
Scott: There are a lot I have.

957
00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:15,730
Scott: I've basically been going through the game one at a time, not going to a new area until I beat the area I'm in completely.

958
00:54:16,292 --> 00:54:17,930
Scott: But, you know, I've only made so much progress.

959
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:25,850
Rym: But the fact that you can just back step forward and back as much as you want is part of what makes this game great, kind of like how it was Super Meat Boy.

960
00:54:26,050 --> 00:54:34,230
Scott: It would be infuriating if you had like a reset up, like you set up something and you do it and then it's off by one and you got to redo it all.

961
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:35,549
Scott: It's like, fuck, you'd be like, fuck this.

962
00:54:35,911 --> 00:54:38,490
Rym: That's where Lolo failed, because Lolo, you push something against the wall.

963
00:54:38,811 --> 00:54:40,089
Scott: Fuck, whole level's ruined now.

964
00:54:40,693 --> 00:54:41,589
Rym: Better kill myself.

965
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:42,099
Scott: Yep.

966
00:54:42,490 --> 00:54:46,129
Scott: Whereas here, it's like, OK, you can step back one space and figure everything out.

967
00:54:46,532 --> 00:54:49,550
Rym: And the other two components, one, it has a world map.

968
00:54:49,871 --> 00:54:58,309
Rym: So if you're really having trouble with like an area, you can go to another area and you can sort of choose your own path through the game.

969
00:54:58,830 --> 00:55:00,029
Scott: It doesn't matter what order you do stuff.

970
00:55:00,192 --> 00:55:01,108
Rym: Nope, doesn't matter at all.

971
00:55:04,072 --> 00:55:10,357
Rym: And there are so many things, the solutions to some of these puzzles, they're not they don't all just turn into a lot of puzzle.

972
00:55:10,377 --> 00:55:13,370
Rym: games will end up having a certain kind of puzzle.

973
00:55:13,432 --> 00:55:14,149
Rym: that's the end game.

974
00:55:14,270 --> 00:55:15,629
Rym: And like all the puzzles would be like that.

975
00:55:16,190 --> 00:55:19,450
Rym: Some of these puzzles have ridiculous solutions, right?

976
00:55:19,510 --> 00:55:26,469
Scott: So the most one of the best ones I've come across so far was there was a line down the middle of the map made of grass.

977
00:55:26,773 --> 00:55:28,250
Rym: Oh, I know which one you're talking about.

978
00:55:28,270 --> 00:55:34,570
Scott: And it said on the right side, it said grass is defeat and that you is no way to change that, right?

979
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:34,791
Scott: It was.

980
00:55:34,871 --> 00:55:40,250
Scott: there are a lot of times where the maps will be such that the rules are in inaccessible areas and can never be changed.

981
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:43,869
Rym: Like if they really want to make it clear, they'll put it in like the bottom right of the map.

982
00:55:43,990 --> 00:55:45,618
Rym: So there's literally no way to ever.

983
00:55:45,638 --> 00:55:48,130
Scott: some some levels will be like Baba is Baba.

984
00:55:48,371 --> 00:55:50,370
Scott: Baba is you and lock it in with a wall.

985
00:55:50,571 --> 00:55:52,789
Scott: And also inside that wall will be wall is stop.

986
00:55:53,211 --> 00:56:01,150
Scott: Now there is absolutely impossible for you, Baba to turn into anything else for you to not be Baba for you to get in there and change those rules.

987
00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:02,709
Scott: It's like the lock in certain things.

988
00:56:02,971 --> 00:56:10,870
Scott: So grass is defeat was locked in and flag was win and the flag goes on the other side of the grass and you're Baba and you're on the left side of the grass.

989
00:56:11,234 --> 00:56:12,190
Scott: How do you get over there?

990
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:26,330
Scott: Well, it just so happens that the rules of the game are such that would defeat means is that if you are the thing that is defeat or if you are on the same space as the thing that is defeat, you lose and you you don't win this map.

991
00:56:26,754 --> 00:56:27,988
Rym: What if Baba isn't you?

992
00:56:29,030 --> 00:56:37,690
Scott: So normally when nothing is you, what happens in the game is the game just goes and you have to rewind to become you again.

993
00:56:37,950 --> 00:56:41,010
Rym: I like the aesthetic because the game is really good atmospheric music.

994
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:42,070
Rym: I really like the music.

995
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:49,569
Scott: And but if nothing is you, the music stops and it goes, it makes this noise like it just feels very hollow and sad when that happens.

996
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:55,870
Scott: But this map also had the the the verb of move.

997
00:56:55,951 --> 00:56:57,290
Scott: You could make certain things move.

998
00:56:57,450 --> 00:57:09,947
Scott: And what that means is if anything is move, that thing will move one space in the direction it's facing per click and you have a button on your controller that waits one click without moving you.

999
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:18,889
Scott: Normally, if you move, that causes one click of time to happen for every space you move and anything that is move would move one space along with you.

1000
00:57:19,411 --> 00:57:26,410
Scott: But you can also just wait in one space and push the wait button and all the things that are move will move one space each time you push the button.

1001
00:57:26,731 --> 00:57:31,330
Scott: The way to beat this map was to arrange things such that you are not you.

1002
00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:37,650
Scott: Nothing is you, but yet the things that are move will push Baba across the grass.

1003
00:57:38,051 --> 00:57:45,529
Scott: So even though you touch Baba touch the grass and the grass is still defeat, Baba is not you while you're touching the grass.

1004
00:57:46,211 --> 00:57:54,009
Scott: Then they move in such a way that as soon as you're on the other side of the grass, they push things around so that Baba is you again.

1005
00:57:54,931 --> 00:58:01,569
Scott: Then you can move that Baba escape and get over to the flag now that you're on the now that Baba is on the other side of the grass.

1006
00:58:02,391 --> 00:58:06,650
Scott: And that was like I managed to somehow do that and I succeed and it was incredible.

1007
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:09,448
Scott: I'm just after staring at it for like 10, 20 minutes.

1008
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:15,926
Rym: But the game also does a good job of depending on as you're going, it'll introduce mechanics one by one.

1009
00:58:16,311 --> 00:58:22,329
Scott: Yeah, each area introduces like a new mechanic and then pushes that mechanic all the way under the limit.

1010
00:58:22,530 --> 00:58:25,810
Rym: And the limit is way further out than you would expect.

1011
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:28,910
Rym: Like some of these things get kind of amazing.

1012
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:33,010
Scott: I have not seen block pushing puzzles of this magnitude before in my life.

1013
00:58:33,090 --> 00:58:42,130
Scott: If you love pushing blocks around in a 2D plane to solve a puzzle, this is the best game like that in all of human history.

1014
00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:45,010
Rym: There has never been something as good at being that as this.

1015
00:58:45,050 --> 00:58:51,910
Scott: In all the how long humans have been around, there has never been a 2D block pushing puzzle on the level of Baba is you.

1016
00:58:52,130 --> 00:58:54,830
Scott: It is the undisputed number one king of that.

1017
00:58:55,090 --> 00:58:55,950
Rym: And it's big.

1018
00:58:56,050 --> 00:58:58,803
Rym: There are a lot of levels like.

1019
00:58:58,843 --> 00:58:59,928
Rym: there's a lot going on.

1020
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:06,490
Scott: I don't know if there's an official level editor, but I have seen people customizing it with some sort of hack, mod, ROM.

1021
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:10,810
Rym: I already saw someone implement Conway's Game of Life entirely within Baba is you.

1022
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:12,370
Scott: Yes, I saw that as well.

1023
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:12,618
Rym: Yep.

1024
00:59:13,093 --> 00:59:15,129
Rym: I was debating using that as the thing of the day today.

1025
00:59:16,971 --> 00:59:22,327
Rym: So this is like it's pretty rare that we'll say if you must buy a game, this is a must buy game.

1026
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:32,050
Scott: If you like puzzle video games that are solo puzzles, especially the 2D block pushing kind, if you like programming games, you like logic puzzles, Zachtronics games.

1027
00:59:32,410 --> 00:59:32,510
Scott: Yeah.

1028
00:59:32,550 --> 00:59:37,670
Scott: If you like anything like that, this is adjacent or in some proximity to all of those.

1029
00:59:38,131 --> 00:59:39,985
Scott: You cannot miss Baba is you?

1030
00:59:40,025 --> 00:59:40,650
Scott: just get it now.

1031
00:59:40,730 --> 00:59:43,050
Scott: Whatever the full price is, doesn't even matter.

1032
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:43,509
Scott: Don't wait.

1033
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:44,148
Scott: Play this today.

1034
00:59:44,310 --> 00:59:44,411
Scott: And

1035
00:59:44,591 --> 00:59:54,228
Rym: even if you feel like you will not be smart enough or capable enough to like fully beat the game, even if that's true, playing the first like 30 levels,

1036
00:59:54,248 --> 01:00:01,930
Scott: what I would recommend to you is if you're not sure, the original free game jam version of the game is still available for free on itch.io.

1037
01:00:02,110 --> 01:00:02,867
Scott: Go to itch.io.

1038
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:04,688
Scott: Just search for Baba is you.

1039
01:00:05,052 --> 01:00:07,050
Scott: You'll be able to see this two links on itch.io.

1040
01:00:07,210 --> 01:00:09,930
Scott: One is for the $15 full game, the same one you get on Steam.

1041
01:00:10,233 --> 01:00:11,570
Scott: It's like a DRM free version.

1042
01:00:11,690 --> 01:00:12,369
Scott: I guess you can get that.

1043
01:00:12,490 --> 01:00:12,950
Scott: That'd be good.

1044
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:18,073
Scott: Or you can get the original game jam version for $0.

1045
01:00:18,073 --> 01:00:19,309
Scott: Get that and play it.

1046
01:00:19,470 --> 01:00:21,989
Scott: If you're not sure, watch some YouTube videos if you're not sure.

1047
01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:29,689
Scott: And then if you're sure or you take my advice or you're a cool person, pay $15 or whatever it is to get the real deal.

1048
01:00:30,351 --> 01:00:31,367
Rym: And then Baba will be you.

1049
01:00:37,470 --> 01:00:39,610
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1050
01:00:39,790 --> 01:00:44,749
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1051
01:00:45,111 --> 01:00:50,150
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

1052
01:00:50,770 --> 01:00:53,070
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1053
01:00:53,350 --> 01:00:57,810
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1054
01:00:58,250 --> 01:01:01,346
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1055
01:01:02,650 --> 01:01:05,650
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1056
01:01:05,890 --> 01:01:08,770
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1061
01:01:58,390 --> 01:02:00,525
Rym: But now I leave you with...

1062
01:02:00,525 --> 01:02:05,390
Scott: >> The way officials tell it, Boston has become the victim of an electronic blight.

1063
01:02:06,371 --> 01:02:15,770
Scott: With fewer than 600,000 people, the city has 4 to 5,000 video games, not just in arcades but also in drugstores, pizza parlors, supermarkets.

1064
01:02:15,770 --> 01:02:24,690
Rym: >> In some sections of the city, we have a machine or two machines and sometimes three machines in virtually every single corner store in a neighborhood.

1065
01:02:24,690 --> 01:02:32,750
Scott: >> City officials today announced that video games no longer will be licensed in residential areas, only in commercial and industrial neighborhoods.

1066
01:02:33,610 --> 01:02:41,330
Scott: Officials say they are responding to complaints from parents that children have skipped school or stolen money to play the games and made a nuisance of themselves.

1067
01:02:41,330 --> 01:02:43,529
Scott: >> Senior citizens have rights.

1068
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:47,450
Rym: They have rights to go into the laundromat and wash the laundry in peace.

1069
01:02:47,870 --> 01:02:57,129
Rym: They don't have to go buy two or three machines or kids congregating and passing fast remarks as they walk in and terrorizing them in some instances as they go in.

1070
01:02:57,129 --> 01:03:07,269
Scott: >> Under the new regulations, licenses for about half the video games already in Boston are unlikely to be renewed, including those in the basement of the South Boston Martial Arts Academy.

1071
01:03:07,269 --> 01:03:17,770
Scott: >> The reason we requested to have video games is so we could bring in extra money so we could allow those kids that are out in our neighborhoods that can't afford to come.

1072
01:03:17,770 --> 01:03:23,630
Scott: >> When they don't have something to do when they're walking the streets, that's when problems are created, not because of machines.

1073
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,850
Rym: The lack of machines causes problems.

1074
01:03:25,850 --> 01:03:30,290
Scott: >> You're always talking about this demeaning kid or making kids' minds like vegetables.

1075
01:03:30,510 --> 01:03:32,530
Scott: Talk about them out on the street smoking pot.

1076
01:03:32,530 --> 01:03:42,910
Scott: >> One MIT study of more than 800 video game players found no basis in fact for an underlying fear expressed by parents during public hearings that video games lead to violence.

1077
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:48,210
Scott: Though a conclusive study has yet to be conducted, Boston went ahead with its restrictive rules.
