1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,973
Rym: It's Tuesday, June 23rd.

2
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:12,774
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,794 --> 00:00:13,374
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,535 --> 00:00:14,776
Rym: And this is Geek Nodz.

5
00:00:14,816 --> 00:00:15,177
Rym: Tonight...

6
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:26,908
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:30,961 --> 00:00:32,788
Rym: So this weekend was a burning weekend.

8
00:00:32,808 --> 00:00:34,875
Rym: We got the crew together, played our burning wheel.

9
00:00:34,995 --> 00:00:44,517
Rym: We finally dropped that long-running Epic Roman politics campaign to play something more birthed in burning wheel as opposed to originally birthed in D&D.

10
00:00:46,022 --> 00:00:46,987
Rym: I think it worked really well.

11
00:00:47,269 --> 00:00:49,440
Scott: Yeah, it was a pretty good game going on.

12
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:54,260
Scott: I just I wish I wasn't so humid and I didn't get a headache and sort of pass out.

13
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,505
Rym: I felt so bad for Scott.

14
00:00:55,525 --> 00:01:01,168
Rym: The game was going strong and he was being all spidery and then about halfway through he kind of laid down and never got that guy.

15
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:02,293
Scott: It's like I was like I was.

16
00:01:02,393 --> 00:01:03,939
Scott: I was like I don't want to lay down.

17
00:01:04,221 --> 00:01:05,025
Scott: I shouldn't lay down.

18
00:01:05,045 --> 00:01:07,860
Scott: I know laying down is like you know the bad move.

19
00:01:08,482 --> 00:01:10,768
Scott: But it was just so bleh and Alex.

20
00:01:11,089 --> 00:01:13,737
Scott: I know he has that really powerful air conditioner.

21
00:01:13,878 --> 00:01:14,540
Scott: That would have worked.

22
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:15,585
Scott: He just didn't want to put it in.

23
00:01:15,645 --> 00:01:17,051
Rym: You know he never uses that thing.

24
00:01:17,092 --> 00:01:17,413
Rym: I'm surprised.

25
00:01:17,433 --> 00:01:21,491
Scott: The thing is so so Ridiculously powerful and has so many BTUs.

26
00:01:21,511 --> 00:01:23,380
Scott: It would have been fun, but he didn't use it.

27
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:33,103
Scott: And so you know not even just because of the heat I was feeling bleh earlier, and it was just compounding my bleh, but I had probably the best duel of wits I've ever had.

28
00:01:33,183 --> 00:01:34,167
Rym: I used ugly truth.

29
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:35,372
Rym: I'm proud of that.

30
00:01:35,452 --> 00:01:36,959
Scott: Oh you duel of wits Jess, right?

31
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:37,986
Scott: Yeah Yeah, I remember that.

32
00:01:38,087 --> 00:01:38,954
Rym: That was pretty epic.

33
00:01:39,035 --> 00:01:39,600
Scott: That was alright.

34
00:01:40,703 --> 00:01:48,554
Rym: But you know after the game the next day we're hanging out with the crew like we always do and you know people leave at different times and half the crew had left and half the crew was still around.

35
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:53,540
Rym: and Kate and Adam, well Adam, takes the dogs outside for a walk.

36
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:59,122
Rym: Yeah, you forgot about what happened over the weekend because I was like I got something to talk about and you were like alright I got nothing.

37
00:01:59,142 --> 00:02:01,411
Scott: Yeah, I knew there was something.

38
00:02:01,431 --> 00:02:02,375
Scott: I just couldn't forget what it was.

39
00:02:02,777 --> 00:02:07,856
Rym: So Adam's out there And he yells from the outside downstairs down from the deck.

40
00:02:08,377 --> 00:02:12,107
Rym: Hey, Rym Somebody left an alligator skull down here.

41
00:02:12,127 --> 00:02:15,838
Rym: No, I think it's an entire alligator head.

42
00:02:16,339 --> 00:02:16,580
Scott: What?

43
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,985
Rym: You gotta come see this.

44
00:02:18,186 --> 00:02:19,773
Scott: First of all, we're not in Florida.

45
00:02:19,793 --> 00:02:20,898
Scott: So this makes no sense.

46
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:32,399
Rym: Second I'm expecting to see like a deer skull or a stick shaped vaguely like an alligator head or I don't know Just a piece of garbage, but I walk out there and I see this thing.

47
00:02:32,841 --> 00:02:35,574
Rym: So I what we go up to it and he's like that's an alligator skull.

48
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:37,622
Rym: I'm like, I don't know I don't know.

49
00:02:37,662 --> 00:02:38,345
Rym: So he grabs a stick.

50
00:02:38,365 --> 00:02:39,027
Rym: He flips it over.

51
00:02:39,047 --> 00:02:40,894
Rym: It's a fucking alligator head.

52
00:02:41,276 --> 00:02:43,868
Scott: It's not even just the skull It's like the full head.

53
00:02:43,888 --> 00:02:44,874
Scott: It's got an eyeball.

54
00:02:45,095 --> 00:02:46,785
Scott: It's got teeth It's got skin.

55
00:02:46,825 --> 00:02:48,835
Scott: It's got all sorts of business going on.

56
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:53,291
Scott: It's a full on Alligators head like cut off right behind the eyes.

57
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:55,057
Rym: It was definitely real too.

58
00:02:55,399 --> 00:03:00,716
Rym: Absolutely It was taxidermy because it had a glass eye, but that was definitely a real alligator.

59
00:03:00,756 --> 00:03:01,639
Scott: Yeah, it was clearly.

60
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:02,964
Scott: yeah It's like it was so weird.

61
00:03:03,004 --> 00:03:04,149
Scott: It was like, okay.

62
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:12,191
Scott: There's no way that this is actually a Alligator that died back here because it's not Florida But it was taxidermy.

63
00:03:12,412 --> 00:03:17,400
Scott: alligator head made its way into our backyard And it wasn't like we couldn't find the rest of the alligator.

64
00:03:17,692 --> 00:03:24,040
Rym: Yeah The thing is the head was cut off like sawed off cleanly and the spine and everything was still in there like the spa.

65
00:03:24,461 --> 00:03:30,920
Rym: Oh my god, it was pretty nasty, but it was sawed clean off and the head was facing forward from this old wooden fence.

66
00:03:31,602 --> 00:03:38,548
Rym: So we all kind of climb up onto the fence and look over not really expecting an alligator body But kind of expecting one.

67
00:03:38,748 --> 00:03:40,737
Scott: but there was not an alligator body over there.

68
00:03:40,857 --> 00:03:41,480
Rym: We looked around.

69
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,972
Rym: I went back there later and there's no alligator body.

70
00:03:43,992 --> 00:03:45,780
Scott: It's like how did it get back there?

71
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,680
Scott: It's like our backyard is basically not existed and no one goes back.

72
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:54,520
Rym: No one goes there had to have been there for the entirety of the years that we've been living here.

73
00:03:54,862 --> 00:03:57,319
Scott: There is no way it was there for the entirety of the year.

74
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,809
Rym: But then how would have gotten there?

75
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:00,079
Rym: who would have put it there?

76
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,480
Scott: There's no knowing how it got there.

77
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:08,920
Scott: But regardless there is an alligator head that was in the backyard and we throw it out and I have a pictures of it.

78
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:12,220
Rym: The neighbor lady comes out and she's like, what are you guys all looking at?

79
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:17,396
Rym: And we're like, there's an alligator head behind the house and she's like, I don't know anything about that.

80
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:19,634
Scott: I Think she put it there.

81
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,623
Scott: She's covered it up.

82
00:04:22,105 --> 00:04:24,713
Rym: The fact that it was cut off so cleanly.

83
00:04:24,733 --> 00:04:27,563
Scott: It was very strange Of course.

84
00:04:27,624 --> 00:04:30,960
Rym: the my second thought after that's an alligator head.

85
00:04:31,221 --> 00:04:35,154
Rym: Well, I guess my third thought because my second thought was it has a glass eye.

86
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:38,177
Rym: the third thought was Draco Litch.

87
00:04:39,205 --> 00:04:39,498
Scott: What?

88
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,764
Rym: Maybe arch Litch?

89
00:04:41,904 --> 00:04:42,226
Scott: my.

90
00:04:42,306 --> 00:04:43,993
Scott: my thought was how the fuck did it get there?

91
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:45,599
Scott: And I still don't know and I probably never will.

92
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,458
Rym: So that was our weekend burning wheel and an alligator head.

93
00:04:54,423 --> 00:04:55,429
Rym: We took some pictures of it.

94
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:57,499
Rym: we'll put them online at some point just to prove it.

95
00:04:57,901 --> 00:04:59,666
Rym: No one would believe us unless we had pictures.

96
00:04:59,927 --> 00:05:00,790
Scott: picture didn't happen.

97
00:05:01,372 --> 00:05:01,552
Rym: Yep.

98
00:05:01,572 --> 00:05:02,475
Rym: Well, we've got pics.

99
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:03,218
Rym: it happened.

100
00:05:03,238 --> 00:05:03,860
Scott: That's right.

101
00:05:04,886 --> 00:05:05,375
Rym: So what do you got?

102
00:05:08,002 --> 00:05:10,411
Scott: Alright video games, let's see Hmm.

103
00:05:10,431 --> 00:05:10,920
Scott: Oh, right.

104
00:05:11,462 --> 00:05:14,895
Scott: Well, first of all, I want to say that I thought it was that a real pause.

105
00:05:15,035 --> 00:05:16,300
Rym: or did you actually forget what you were?

106
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,012
Rym: Going to say I didn't forget anything.

107
00:05:18,315 --> 00:05:18,557
Rym: Okay?

108
00:05:18,657 --> 00:05:25,357
Scott: Okay So I system shock 2 is an old game that I know that I never played until now.

109
00:05:25,417 --> 00:05:27,407
Rym: you and our waters boys And I think are playing it up.

110
00:05:27,589 --> 00:05:29,080
Scott: Yeah, cuz it's got co-op, right?

111
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,890
Scott: it's like whoa, this old FPS is co-op and that's kind of.

112
00:05:31,911 --> 00:05:38,128
Scott: what I'm dying for is some cop FPS and the thing is it's mostly a RPG FPS more than a cop FPS.

113
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,453
Scott: but playing it.

114
00:05:39,533 --> 00:05:41,540
Scott: It's like I played Bioshock first.

115
00:05:42,103 --> 00:05:52,130
Scott: So now playing System Shock 2 it's like oh wow Bioshock was a lot more like System Shock 2 than I realized Which you know makes sense, but you know, I didn't under.

116
00:05:52,191 --> 00:05:55,139
Scott: I didn't know the connections because I hadn't played both of them.

117
00:05:55,921 --> 00:06:02,160
Scott: But if you haven't played the System Shock 2 it'll run on pretty much almost any computer that's modern.

118
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:05,373
Scott: So and you're not gonna be able to buy it legitimately.

119
00:06:05,413 --> 00:06:06,960
Scott: just get it off the Internet's for free.

120
00:06:07,381 --> 00:06:08,224
Scott: it's not difficult.

121
00:06:08,886 --> 00:06:11,012
Scott: and if you can play it co-op.

122
00:06:11,052 --> 00:06:16,559
Scott: and the interesting thing about playing a co-op right is that The game doesn't give you any more stuff.

123
00:06:17,264 --> 00:06:24,820
Scott: So it's like you have to divide the ammo between you know All the people playing evenly which kind of or you can hoard it all if you're a asshole.

124
00:06:25,621 --> 00:06:27,145
Scott: So it kind of sucks in that regard.

125
00:06:27,526 --> 00:06:32,060
Scott: but in terms of you get these upgrade modules as you complete quests and such.

126
00:06:32,663 --> 00:06:34,980
Scott: So you everyone upgrades a whole shit ton.

127
00:06:35,141 --> 00:06:39,720
Scott: So you it's like you're wicked powerful because normally it's like if you're playing the one-player game.

128
00:06:40,001 --> 00:06:44,393
Scott: You'd have to concentrate on say psychic powers or hacking or military skills.

129
00:06:45,095 --> 00:06:45,576
Scott: We're playing.

130
00:06:45,657 --> 00:06:48,209
Scott: I got all the military skills He's got all the hacking skills.

131
00:06:48,249 --> 00:06:54,053
Scott: So it's like hey we We're maxing it out here and it's it's pretty good.

132
00:06:54,073 --> 00:06:56,260
Scott: Yeah, we're almost done, you know, whatever.

133
00:06:57,769 --> 00:07:06,359
Scott: Also this Friday I think if not late Thursday Blood Bowl is coming out for the PC.

134
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,626
Scott: Now here's the story behind this blood bowl.

135
00:07:09,227 --> 00:07:13,740
Scott: way back in the day games workshop the makers of Warhammer made a game called blood bowl.

136
00:07:14,141 --> 00:07:15,847
Scott: And blood bowl, it's football.

137
00:07:16,047 --> 00:07:18,295
Scott: It's a football game, but you kill people.

138
00:07:18,315 --> 00:07:19,780
Scott: so it's sort of like football Warhammer.

139
00:07:20,221 --> 00:07:26,000
Scott: But it was cool because it was like you get all the good of a miniatures Warhammer type game without the collecting miss.

140
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,426
Scott: You just buy this one box.

141
00:07:27,828 --> 00:07:29,575
Scott: it has blood bowl in it and that's it.

142
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:33,576
Scott: and it was you know But you get it's it's Warhammer like gaming.

143
00:07:33,656 --> 00:07:38,850
Scott: So This they made a warhead a blood bowl video game back in the 90s.

144
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:49,440
Scott: That was all DOS styling, but then another company Unofficially and illegitimately made a game called chaos league right and they got in trouble.

145
00:07:50,023 --> 00:07:51,289
Scott: They were I got they.

146
00:07:51,309 --> 00:07:52,234
Scott: you can't don't do that.

147
00:07:52,777 --> 00:07:57,702
Scott: But then Unlike every other stupid company in the world They made nice.

148
00:07:58,484 --> 00:08:08,084
Scott: and now the people who made chaos league or obviously blood bowl fans are making the official blood bowl game and it's coming out for the PC on Friday and Not it's all.

149
00:08:08,184 --> 00:08:18,978
Scott: in addition to being you know, having the turn-based blood bowl gameplay It also has a real-time blood bowl gameplay that I assume is more like Madden ish kind of game.

150
00:08:19,058 --> 00:08:21,509
Scott: I don't know The trailer is not really.

151
00:08:21,811 --> 00:08:23,519
Scott: the video trailer is not really helping me out here.

152
00:08:24,281 --> 00:08:29,657
Scott: They're also coming out with DS and PSP blood bowls that are a lot like the original board game.

153
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,575
Scott: So You know the game is kind of expensive to buy the board version.

154
00:08:34,756 --> 00:08:35,600
Scott: It's like $75.

155
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,889
Rym: It's kind of hard to find.

156
00:08:37,191 --> 00:08:38,559
Scott: Oh, no, you can just buy it online easily.

157
00:08:38,902 --> 00:08:43,870
Rym: I don't know at least in person because I remember at RIT You just go to the games workshop store in the city.

158
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:47,739
Rym: They got true remember at RIT They had like three sets of it at our wag.

159
00:08:47,941 --> 00:08:50,272
Scott: Well millennium had like three sets and they were always just sitting there.

160
00:08:50,312 --> 00:08:50,835
Scott: No one bought it.

161
00:08:50,996 --> 00:08:54,587
Scott: Yeah anyway You got to go to a gaming store to get.

162
00:08:54,607 --> 00:08:56,034
Scott: you're not gonna find it anywhere else.

163
00:08:56,175 --> 00:08:57,280
Rym: It's not gonna be a Toys R Us.

164
00:08:57,402 --> 00:08:58,097
Scott: Yeah, that's for sure.

165
00:08:59,241 --> 00:09:00,267
Scott: But the video game is $50.

166
00:09:00,267 --> 00:09:09,033
Scott: So if you think of it, that's sort of a steal Especially since you're getting the you know The board game and another game and all these graphics and on such and such.

167
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:18,110
Scott: I don't think it's gonna be on steam though Just sort of like bleh, but it is gonna be you know, downloadable Somehow through whatever frickin service they're using.

168
00:09:18,511 --> 00:09:22,628
Scott: I think my strategy is I'm gonna wait like a few days You know wait probably till the next week.

169
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:32,896
Scott: see how people receive the game See if they like it or not And you know if there's enough people playing it so that I can actually you know Get the game on against people often enough.

170
00:09:32,936 --> 00:09:33,540
Scott: then I'll buy it.

171
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:42,745
Scott: Otherwise, I'll wait until it's much less expensive or I'll just get the DS one, you know and just play that with the local Multiplayer against people.

172
00:09:43,046 --> 00:09:43,487
Rym: we'll see.

173
00:09:43,527 --> 00:09:45,273
Rym: I mean the DS more and more.

174
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,922
Rym: the DS just can't have the complex kind of games I want.

175
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:48,906
Scott: well, it's it's basically.

176
00:09:48,946 --> 00:09:50,091
Scott: I looked at the screenshots.

177
00:09:50,152 --> 00:09:52,100
Scott: The DS one's not gonna be out for a lot longer.

178
00:09:52,202 --> 00:09:58,960
Scott: It's not coming out on Friday But the DS one it looks like it's just blood Bowl just like the board game only on the DS.

179
00:10:00,161 --> 00:10:01,639
Scott: So yeah, can't really go wrong.

180
00:10:02,362 --> 00:10:06,740
Rym: I've only actually played blood Bowl the board game once and I didn't even play it all the way through.

181
00:10:07,342 --> 00:10:09,209
Scott: Yeah, it's basically the way it works.

182
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:09,771
Scott: is you have?

183
00:10:10,032 --> 00:10:24,837
Scott: the basic rules are like this right you have so many players right, but only 11 can be on the field at once because football and Every turn each guy can perform an action and the actions are like move block kill.

184
00:10:25,784 --> 00:10:29,280
Scott: You know block is is fight, you know pass chart, right?

185
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:45,100
Scott: But then there are certain special actions right and on your turn You can only do one special action with one dude, you know, so, you know It's like everyone on your whole team does one of the normal actions and one guy can do a special action.

186
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:45,905
Scott: It could be any guy.

187
00:10:45,926 --> 00:10:50,139
Scott: so you can have like this guy do the special action or that guy It's not like only the quarterback can do the special action.

188
00:10:50,641 --> 00:11:06,680
Scott: But and you basically you just do this every turn, you know, and then there's some dice and some other charts and things You know like if you and like, you know, if you move and if you move near enemies They can try to trip you and all this sort of stuff, you know, but that's that's how the game is played.

189
00:11:06,761 --> 00:11:08,272
Scott: so it's you know, it's pretty good.

190
00:11:08,312 --> 00:11:12,813
Scott: as far as a Miniature turn-based strategy games go plus football.

191
00:11:13,194 --> 00:11:21,489
Rym: but speaking of games that are coming out We didn't talk about this as much as I would have expected because it kind of it got Announced when we weren't really doing video game shows.

192
00:11:21,529 --> 00:11:28,405
Rym: We were kind of in this in-between period for various reasons, but NS2 is actually coming for real.

193
00:11:28,785 --> 00:11:30,528
Rym: pre-orders were announced a while ago.

194
00:11:30,569 --> 00:11:40,070
Rym: You can go right now spend money pre-order and All I know is that I look to see if we had talked about this as a noobs.

195
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:51,230
Rym: I didn't remember and I saw that the last time we noted that we talked about natural selection Was in 2006 when NS2 announced that they might have dynamic infestation.

196
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:54,843
Scott: So we're gonna have to go over this whole thing again, basically natural selection.

197
00:11:55,144 --> 00:11:56,830
Scott: one is an awesome half-life mod.

198
00:11:57,171 --> 00:12:01,410
Scott: That's an RTS and an FPS at the same time and we don't need to explain that we did.

199
00:12:01,531 --> 00:12:02,718
Rym: I just finished the explanation.

200
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,865
Rym: We did all show on it.

201
00:12:03,945 --> 00:12:11,411
Rym: NS2 is Pretty much the only game I've been looking forward to since Team Fortress 2.

202
00:12:11,411 --> 00:12:14,581
Scott: Yeah, and especially since Team Fortress 2 was up, right?

203
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:20,422
Rym: Team Fortress 2 was awesome up until the moment I took my first step as a player in the game.

204
00:12:20,442 --> 00:12:25,623
Rym: Yeah at that moment I was vaguely disappointed and I became extremely disappointed.

205
00:12:25,643 --> 00:12:26,989
Scott: Team Fortress 2 is like wow.

206
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:28,435
Scott: to me It's like the game itself.

207
00:12:28,535 --> 00:12:35,520
Scott: the gameplay poop complete poop, but many humorous things result, you know Like Leroy Jenkins and you know meet the whoever.

208
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:42,201
Rym: Well, the thing is oh my god meet the spy was pretty damn good It was better than the everything since meet the heavy.

209
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:43,625
Scott: Oh, I like the engineer one.

210
00:12:43,825 --> 00:12:44,467
Rym: It was okay.

211
00:12:44,507 --> 00:12:52,050
Rym: Anyway, but NS2 is Probably going to be the most important FPS to come out since the re-release of Quake 3.

212
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:55,769
Scott: Yes, not only is NS2 first of all outside its own engine, right?

213
00:12:56,451 --> 00:12:59,249
Scott: It's not using the half-life engine or the source entry or anything.

214
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,144
Scott: Secondly, the system requirements are really low.

215
00:13:02,164 --> 00:13:09,296
Rym: So everyone can play Number three, I mean seriously 1.2 gigahertz processor 200.

216
00:13:09,296 --> 00:13:18,815
Scott: you might be able to play it in a netbook if you got a GPU 256 megabytes of RAM DirectX 9 a mouse a keyboard Okay, internet access.

217
00:13:18,835 --> 00:13:22,186
Scott: Yeah, it's gonna be super moddable with Lua.

218
00:13:22,267 --> 00:13:24,762
Scott: if you don't know what Lua is It's basically a scripting language.

219
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:25,569
Scott: That's mad easy.

220
00:13:26,512 --> 00:13:28,749
Scott: So you people get me modding the fuck out of this game.

221
00:13:29,111 --> 00:13:32,182
Rym: Well more importantly the team behind it these people.

222
00:13:32,202 --> 00:13:37,560
Rym: we're not gonna not the whole not to tell the whole story here But NS1 was a game that had a niche.

223
00:13:37,621 --> 00:13:40,290
Rym: It wasn't super popular outside of people who got it.

224
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:45,954
Rym: it has a very small community that is extremely dedicated much like Not quake arena.

225
00:13:45,995 --> 00:13:52,268
Rym: quicker in is basically dead like mega TF or weapons factory or tribes to now There's these little groups of people that play it and no one else does.

226
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:55,990
Rym: But the people who made NS get it.

227
00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:02,849
Rym: They understand what it is to make a unique and different and amazing game more so than other people I have seen.

228
00:14:03,632 --> 00:14:13,779
Rym: Natural selection is one of the greatest games ever made and NS2 Even if it is even if they deliver on less than half of what they claim to deliver on It's still gonna be the best FPS ever.

229
00:14:14,181 --> 00:14:17,072
Rym: probably looks like it at least the best AC.

230
00:14:17,112 --> 00:14:22,110
Rym: well, not even asymmetric because I think it'll be the best versus FPS ever made quite possibly.

231
00:14:22,432 --> 00:14:28,123
Scott: I mean I can't counter-strike and tribes two are up there But I can't put it in the same categories like half-life.

232
00:14:28,163 --> 00:14:29,570
Rym: single-player is a totally different thing.

233
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:34,369
Scott: Yeah, no, but I mean some of the changes that I heard about are you know, they're doing?

234
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:37,083
Scott: look You know, first of all, all the graphics are updated right?

235
00:14:37,103 --> 00:14:40,230
Rym: They look real good If the teaser trailer is to be believed.

236
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:42,429
Scott: Yeah, but you know, they're doing a lot.

237
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:47,527
Scott: First of all, the alien is gonna have a commander which is good and bad sort of I kind of see.

238
00:14:47,688 --> 00:14:49,715
Rym: at one hand I think that's crap.

239
00:14:49,835 --> 00:14:56,370
Rym: I liked the hive mine, you know asymmetric whatever but at the same time I've really trust these guys judgment?

240
00:14:56,631 --> 00:15:02,930
Scott: Yeah, also like the ono stomp is gonna disable structures and such temporarily.

241
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:07,305
Scott: So we could like stomp on the IP and the IP will stop spinning.

242
00:15:07,426 --> 00:15:08,650
Scott: apparently the new IP spins.

243
00:15:09,071 --> 00:15:10,655
Rym: Basically, what I think they're doing is they?

244
00:15:10,835 --> 00:15:16,931
Rym: they they were really ambitious with ns1 and they basically pushed half-life 1 as far as they Could.

245
00:15:16,951 --> 00:15:23,070
Rym: yeah and all the stuff they didn't do they wanted to do they just do that the game they'd already reached the limit.

246
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,968
Rym: I mean babblers never worked.

247
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:31,110
Scott: Yeah I mean basically like you know These guys are great at taking a small amount of resources and pushing them to the max.

248
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:36,530
Scott: I mean their half-life 1 mod looks as good as a lot of hat better than half-life 2 mods that are out there.

249
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:40,375
Scott: it's so good, but so the You know, they're.

250
00:15:40,516 --> 00:15:47,180
Scott: that's why that has such low system requirements because they have the skills to be able to push You know really hard and make it really awesome.

251
00:15:47,401 --> 00:15:49,910
Scott: But also they're not eating lots of you know, fancy shit.

252
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:53,943
Rym: They're not like taking the original game and just like going crazy.

253
00:15:53,983 --> 00:15:57,015
Rym: now that they have resources and they're doing it on their own And all this stuff there.

254
00:15:57,538 --> 00:16:04,125
Rym: as far as I can tell they're basically doing all the things That they wanted to do originally but couldn't just due to limitations of technology.

255
00:16:04,206 --> 00:16:05,089
Scott: Yeah, they're also the.

256
00:16:05,611 --> 00:16:08,050
Scott: The infestation is going to spread.

257
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,822
Scott: I don't know how it will spread but it's gonna spread in some way.

258
00:16:10,882 --> 00:16:16,890
Scott: and then you can use flamethrowers You know to push it back well, or you can close bulkheads to sort of just seal it back.

259
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:21,770
Rym: Well, one thing about NS that made it great was that it was primarily an area control game.

260
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:26,650
Rym: But area control was either siege points choke points or resource towers.

261
00:16:27,232 --> 00:16:31,290
Rym: But now with this infestation area control takes on a much more visceral feeling.

262
00:16:31,853 --> 00:16:36,836
Scott: It's a lot more zerg ish on the bad guys on the alien side Not bad guys.

263
00:16:36,856 --> 00:16:38,665
Scott: You could be the aliens then it'd be the good guys.

264
00:16:38,806 --> 00:16:41,699
Rym: They Know the natural selection team unknown worlds.

265
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:51,337
Rym: They they breached this balance between atmosphere aka realism and gameplay That I've never seen anyone ever come close to.

266
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:58,618
Rym: games usually decide between being atmospheric and immersive or being a good Straight up, you know competitive game.

267
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:04,199
Scott: Yeah, like very quick is really good game It's it's you know game play is all about.

268
00:17:04,239 --> 00:17:06,970
Scott: there's no atmosphere atmosphere in quake.

269
00:17:07,512 --> 00:17:10,861
Scott: It barely feels like you know, but say half-life.

270
00:17:11,021 --> 00:17:13,750
Scott: well half-life has good gameplay, but not multiplayer.

271
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:14,050
Scott: Why?

272
00:17:14,111 --> 00:17:19,429
Rym: yes counter-strike did a pretty good job of giving up some of the realism to make the game playable and fun.

273
00:17:20,712 --> 00:17:25,270
Rym: Action quake was not in any way realistic and had very little atmosphere, but it was real fun.

274
00:17:25,771 --> 00:17:31,970
Rym: Yep, but NS2 they never sacrificed gameplay for style or vice-versa, but they max both of them out.

275
00:17:32,612 --> 00:17:33,536
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty crazy.

276
00:17:33,797 --> 00:17:37,009
Scott: Anyway, I'm really gonna make a concerted effort to make mods of NS2.

277
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:41,487
Scott: I've never really done the mods big time but NS2 we're gonna mod that shit.

278
00:17:41,507 --> 00:17:43,053
Scott: first mod Babblers.

279
00:17:43,414 --> 00:17:44,077
Scott: first mod bat.

280
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:45,301
Scott: we're gonna do all the obvious.

281
00:17:45,341 --> 00:17:47,509
Scott: mods gorge no animation jump.

282
00:17:48,451 --> 00:17:54,178
Scott: You know classic mode gorge race combat gorge race Babblers.

283
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:56,779
Rym: Oh I can love babblers.

284
00:17:57,181 --> 00:18:01,010
Rym: But anyway, just you know, be aware We don't advertise or anything on GeekNights.

285
00:18:01,111 --> 00:18:06,637
Rym: But you can pre-order NS2 and you can either spend $20 or twice as much as that.

286
00:18:06,978 --> 00:18:08,463
Rym: and you don't get anything different.

287
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:13,448
Rym: if you spend more other than that You held these people out and you get black armor.

288
00:18:15,051 --> 00:18:16,898
Rym: It's actually beta and the alpha.

289
00:18:17,098 --> 00:18:19,266
Scott: Yeah, it's actually sort of quite needed to pay the $40.

290
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:21,990
Scott: if we're gonna mod it We're gonna need to get in as early as possible.

291
00:18:22,532 --> 00:18:27,827
Scott: But also it's interesting to see that the vast majority of the pre-orders got that they didn't say how.

292
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:32,883
Scott: I didn't see how many there Were but they said the vast majority percentage wise of pre-orders were the $40.

293
00:18:32,883 --> 00:18:33,305
Rym: think about it.

294
00:18:33,385 --> 00:18:34,750
Rym: who is pre-ordering this game?

295
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:41,090
Rym: But the existing NS community is in my opinion the closest knit online gaming community left.

296
00:18:41,311 --> 00:18:48,894
Scott: Really the survival of the game though depends on the long tail of people buying the $20 version You know after its release.

297
00:18:48,914 --> 00:19:05,047
Rym: but even if only all the current NS2 play NS1 players buy it and then unknown worlds goes out Of business the game exists and these people will play NS for the rest of their lives Probably like it and you might scoff at that, but I really yeah.

320
00:20:44,432 --> 00:20:51,180
Scott: So even if ConnectiCon is no good, right and I don't know how it's gonna be I have no you know, cuz ConnectiCon has been sort of iffy.

321
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,954
Scott: the thing is a. even though ConnectiCon is iffy I'm not gonna lie.

322
00:20:54,975 --> 00:20:56,984
Scott: the board game area.

323
00:20:57,024 --> 00:20:58,433
Scott: There is always 100% awesome.

324
00:20:59,971 --> 00:21:07,033
Rym: They should just make that a convention in and of itself that accounts tabletop gaming is better than most tabletop gaming conventions I've been to.

325
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:09,462
Scott: and two there's a whole panel room.

326
00:21:09,482 --> 00:21:11,550
Scott: That is we it's just us.

327
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:14,292
Scott: So if you're a fan of us, you're listening to us Obviously.

328
00:21:14,794 --> 00:21:24,810
Scott: you can be safe in that room and the tabletop gaming area for the whole convention all three days And it'll be worth your while to go to ConnectiCon and it'll also make us look really good.

329
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,664
Scott: Yeah, you come just for us and no other reason.

330
00:21:28,005 --> 00:21:34,069
Rym: plus I will say this We have gone to ConnectiCon for several years and we have never failed to have a very good time.

331
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:41,088
Rym: We're always a little bit leery ahead of time because the con always kind of Puts it real close to the wire in terms of being ready to run.

332
00:21:41,531 --> 00:21:43,806
Rym: Yeah, but it's always fun when we're there.

333
00:21:43,926 --> 00:21:51,955
Rym: and this year The you can think of this basically as the test run of what we're going to be doing in all the bigger Conventions in years to come.

334
00:21:52,236 --> 00:21:52,497
Scott: Yeah.

335
00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:55,908
Scott: Also, you might see us pass out from doing 11 panels.

336
00:22:06,211 --> 00:22:10,230
Rym: So things of the day I have something very little here very very minor.

337
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,355
Rym: It's not terribly important.

338
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:13,022
Rym: But remember Mortal Kombat.

339
00:22:13,042 --> 00:22:14,970
Rym: It was a. it wasn't a good game.

340
00:22:15,392 --> 00:22:18,510
Rym: No one can claim it was actually a good game with a straight face.

341
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:18,912
Rym: It was not.

342
00:22:18,932 --> 00:22:22,165
Scott: a Mortal Kombat 2 was not well terrible fighting.

343
00:22:22,386 --> 00:22:25,657
Rym: It was a good, you know It was not an objectively good game.

344
00:22:25,797 --> 00:22:30,191
Rym: It was an okay fighting game, but I had Street Fighter 2.

345
00:22:30,191 --> 00:22:32,681
Scott: Well, it was a different kind of fighting game from Street Fighter 2.

346
00:22:32,681 --> 00:22:32,882
Scott: Yes.

347
00:22:32,942 --> 00:22:34,769
Rym: It was a memorize the combos game.

348
00:22:35,532 --> 00:22:36,194
Scott: What game isn't?

349
00:22:36,796 --> 00:22:39,665
Rym: it was memorize the arbitrary annoying counterintuitive.

350
00:22:39,746 --> 00:22:44,797
Rym: not that fun combos game It was.

351
00:22:44,877 --> 00:22:48,710
Rym: it was also the jump up and backwards while kicking most of the time game.

352
00:22:48,939 --> 00:22:50,696
Scott: Yeah that was a very important maneuver.

353
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:55,372
Scott: the cross up kick but jump over a guy and then kick him in the back of the head to Start your combo.

354
00:22:55,413 --> 00:23:04,943
Rym: Yep or jump backwards while kicking hopefully disrupting their attempt to jump forward around you and kick Yep, and also you can beat the single-player by just using the trip.

355
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:10,042
Scott: move over and over and over again except you can like two Characters you can beat the majority of people in arcades.

356
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:11,610
Rym: Do you hear that arcades?

357
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,550
Rym: I played these games in an arc.

358
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:19,351
Scott: This is pretty much the last triumph of the arcade was Street Fighter 2 turbo and Mortal Kombat 2.

359
00:23:19,351 --> 00:23:24,590
Scott: People were lining up in arcades to play these games and then the home versions came out and then the arcade died.

360
00:23:24,751 --> 00:23:28,577
Rym: Mortal Kombat 3 was like the last Arcade game.

361
00:23:28,598 --> 00:23:30,285
Rym: it went up like that was.

362
00:23:30,466 --> 00:23:35,746
Rym: I went to an arcade There was Mortal Kombat 3 then all the arcades shut down like within a month and that was it.

363
00:23:35,927 --> 00:23:45,010
Rym: Yep But Mortal Kombat was important primarily because it was bloody and gory for the time and it set a lot of precedents.

364
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:52,545
Rym: It was the first time video games Really really really shook up pop culture and there was a lot of reaction.

365
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:55,949
Scott: a video game should got pop culture But they didn't shake it up because of violence.

366
00:23:56,756 --> 00:24:05,699
Rym: Yeah, well they'd shaken it up for other reasons but finally they shook it up because of violence in a way that even the Like the slowest reporters figured out.

367
00:24:05,899 --> 00:24:08,126
Rym: Yep, but other than that.

368
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:12,862
Rym: No, it wasn't a great game But they used models to make the game.

369
00:24:12,962 --> 00:24:14,910
Rym: the game, you know was motion capture and model.

370
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:19,684
Scott: Yeah, I mean Street Fighter has always been you know hand-drawn art to make all the characters and such.

371
00:24:19,764 --> 00:24:36,603
Scott: but in Mortal Kombat 2 They used motion capture and photography and stop-motion, you know Even though it was low resolution It looked really good sort of the same way that Donkey Kong Country looked really good because the you know the way they generated all the sprites for all the characters and animations and such.

372
00:24:36,763 --> 00:24:47,964
Rym: but I have a picture for you of How they did that and it is both interesting and a little bit disappointing To see this totally ghetto but totally the same kind of way.

373
00:24:48,044 --> 00:24:48,987
Rym: I would do that sort of thing.

374
00:24:49,007 --> 00:25:00,673
Rym: set up Yeah bonus points for the desk lamp taped to the candy tin that is self held up by two books And it's Goro.

375
00:25:01,074 --> 00:25:01,916
Rym: you get to see Goro.

376
00:25:01,936 --> 00:25:02,879
Scott: he has four arms.

377
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,328
Rym: I hated him so I also have four arms do you?

378
00:25:06,629 --> 00:25:08,439
Rym: yeah All right.

379
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,070
Rym: What do you have for me?

380
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:12,657
Scott: So this is a video game.

381
00:25:12,738 --> 00:25:14,464
Scott: I can't if you can read this page.

382
00:25:14,484 --> 00:25:15,890
Scott: It's a Japanese language page.

383
00:25:16,071 --> 00:25:18,345
Scott: I sort of hovered over all the links looking for a download.

384
00:25:18,365 --> 00:25:19,110
Scott: I couldn't find one.

385
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,217
Scott: I don't know if it's downloadable.

386
00:25:20,258 --> 00:25:20,902
Scott: I don't know what the deal.

387
00:25:20,942 --> 00:25:22,010
Scott: is it even real?

388
00:25:22,997 --> 00:25:26,903
Scott: I think it's real But I don't know how to play it or get it or what it runs on.

389
00:25:27,003 --> 00:25:34,766
Scott: but the game is called Symphony of the blood and I don't know why it's called Symphony of the blood as I would say aka blood symphony.

390
00:25:35,287 --> 00:25:39,455
Scott: what the game is right is a doujin game.

391
00:25:40,117 --> 00:26:00,916
Scott: it is a Tezuka doujin game a Tezuka doujin fighting game in which there is a slew of Tezuka characters Which you can select and then play a sort of guilty gears looking kind of fighting game with so blackjack versus princess knight versus daddy First Unico.

392
00:26:00,957 --> 00:26:02,281
Scott: I don't see Astro boy in there.

393
00:26:02,301 --> 00:26:04,848
Rym: You gotta be in there yet.

394
00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:07,055
Scott: verse You know Jackie Maru.

395
00:26:07,196 --> 00:26:08,620
Scott: verse who knows who?

396
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:08,901
Scott: right?

397
00:26:09,101 --> 00:26:11,910
Scott: all sorts of you know Tezuka character.

398
00:26:12,131 --> 00:26:14,600
Scott: It's pretty hardcore you can all.

399
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:15,102
Scott: all you need.

400
00:26:15,122 --> 00:26:17,210
Scott: the thing of the day is just all these images in this website.

401
00:26:17,371 --> 00:26:22,427
Scott: it's this is a game that I want to play just because of the awesome novelty of it.

402
00:26:23,089 --> 00:26:25,462
Scott: and Yeah, that's that's about it.

403
00:26:26,148 --> 00:26:32,140
Rym: so Remember that sound I?

404
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:37,183
Scott: Not until we just I just reminded me myself of it like a few minutes ago.

405
00:26:37,464 --> 00:26:38,910
Rym: that brought back a flood of memories.

406
00:26:40,851 --> 00:26:44,868
Rym: Green wizard needs food badly, but red warrior shot the food.

407
00:26:44,908 --> 00:26:45,470
Scott: you asshole.

408
00:26:46,874 --> 00:26:48,370
Rym: I remember playing gauntlet a lot.

409
00:26:48,571 --> 00:26:49,795
Scott: You couldn't play to win could you?

410
00:26:49,835 --> 00:26:51,281
Scott: you always said you just play to be an asshole.

411
00:26:51,502 --> 00:26:57,349
Rym: we we played it on the emulator At RIT or actually I think we played it on a real NES a bunch of times, too.

412
00:26:57,671 --> 00:27:01,270
Rym: Yeah, because we had that NES that I won that gamecube version also.

413
00:27:01,531 --> 00:27:05,766
Rym: Yeah, we did, but I also had that NES that I won at Ohio con all right.

414
00:27:06,067 --> 00:27:07,010
Scott: That's why we had extra NES.

415
00:27:07,352 --> 00:27:11,229
Rym: Yeah, we had two NES as a result, but gauntlet was not a good game.

416
00:27:11,952 --> 00:27:14,764
Scott: Well let's talk about what gauntlet is before we talk about why it's.

417
00:27:14,784 --> 00:27:16,230
Rym: does anyone not know what gauntlet is?

418
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:19,330
Rym: Do we really need to start every video game show about a game?

419
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,678
Rym: That's more than like two years old.

420
00:27:20,718 --> 00:27:21,101
Rym: being like.

421
00:27:21,604 --> 00:27:25,968
Rym: this was a game Where you like you know Mario Brothers you walk from left to right to left.

422
00:27:26,249 --> 00:27:26,913
Scott: well I mean all.

423
00:27:26,973 --> 00:27:28,240
Scott: it was really something different.

424
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,913
Scott: I mean back in the day you'd go to the arcade Just rogue.

425
00:27:30,973 --> 00:27:32,938
Rym: only it was like it was real time.

426
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,162
Scott: rogue was real time.

427
00:27:34,503 --> 00:27:37,432
Rym: It was more real time I Guess.

428
00:27:37,714 --> 00:27:41,250
Scott: I think the only difference between gauntlet and rogue really is that it was less.

429
00:27:41,531 --> 00:27:43,823
Scott: it was less complex than rogue you had.

430
00:27:43,843 --> 00:27:56,070
Scott: you could have multiplayer and You everyone shot things you know in sort of in an action RPG Zelda kind of way Whereas in rogue you went up to next to a bad guy and pushed fight fight fight.

431
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:57,016
Rym: Well, you can do that too.

432
00:27:57,036 --> 00:27:57,862
Rym: You can walk up to enemies.

433
00:27:57,902 --> 00:27:58,929
Rym: Just push on them to kill him.

434
00:27:59,371 --> 00:28:00,294
Scott: Yeah, but it wasn't.

435
00:28:00,454 --> 00:28:02,159
Scott: it wasn't you know cycle.

436
00:28:02,179 --> 00:28:05,950
Scott: You know like rogue wasn't exactly turn-based, but it was sort of cycles.

437
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:15,421
Scott: It's like you know to be fight fight fight whereas in discrete units whereas in gauntlet It would be basically the cycles were constantly rolling around.

438
00:28:15,702 --> 00:28:20,609
Scott: you know even if you're just standing still you would just take all shit ton Of damage, I just I remember renting gauntlet.

439
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:24,176
Rym: Fairly, I never bought gauntlet one But I'd rent it every now and then.

440
00:28:24,196 --> 00:28:32,810
Rym: you know every weekend my parents be like you can run one video game And I would sometimes rent the same game more than once because if you rented the wrong game you were fucked for the weekend.

441
00:28:33,132 --> 00:28:36,529
Rym: Yep, I rented some bad games in my time.

442
00:28:37,232 --> 00:28:40,504
Rym: Oh, it sucks, but gauntlet was gauntlet one at least.

443
00:28:40,524 --> 00:28:48,908
Rym: I remember renting it and Being fascinated with it, but at the same time Hating it say I only ever played gauntlet really in the arcades right.

444
00:28:48,948 --> 00:28:58,066
Scott: so gauntlet one in the arcade was something special back in its day because first of all Four people could play it at once and this was before Ninja Turtles or x-men or the Simpsons right.

445
00:28:58,367 --> 00:28:59,269
Scott: so that was a big deal.

446
00:28:59,711 --> 00:29:03,042
Scott: Second of all it had actual voice coming out of the machine.

447
00:29:03,062 --> 00:29:04,928
Scott: it would say things which is a big deal.

448
00:29:05,008 --> 00:29:11,608
Scott: right I mean Sinistar said things, but you know it's like very few machines had that ability to talk to.

449
00:29:11,648 --> 00:29:12,594
Rym: you see I never.

450
00:29:13,018 --> 00:29:14,210
Rym: gauntlet was always in the arcade.

451
00:29:14,411 --> 00:29:17,750
Rym: I never played it because all I could always think was I got gauntlet at home.

452
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:18,775
Rym: It's the same stupid game.

453
00:29:19,016 --> 00:29:21,950
Scott: see I was I had was had gauntlet in the arcade before gauntlet at home.

454
00:29:22,091 --> 00:29:24,782
Scott: So gauntlet was at home also at home.

455
00:29:24,822 --> 00:29:25,907
Scott: You didn't have a four score.

456
00:29:25,927 --> 00:29:30,404
Scott: Yeah, I did Shit and remember that was gauntlet - I didn't know I didn't know anyone with the four score.

457
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:32,853
Rym: one gauntlet one did not have the Four player at home.

458
00:29:32,873 --> 00:29:37,510
Rym: see there you go and - it was much shittier gauntlet - was the best that game got on the NES.

459
00:29:38,233 --> 00:29:39,919
Rym: But gauntlet - I had the four score.

460
00:29:39,939 --> 00:29:41,786
Rym: I would often play it with four people.

461
00:29:42,529 --> 00:29:44,973
Scott: the thing I liked about gauntlet one You know.

462
00:29:45,214 --> 00:29:50,299
Scott: I think the reason I played it all the arcade was sort of like the the dungeon Explory aspect of it.

463
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:55,446
Scott: you know it's like that the sort of maze action And I always I always seem to like maze action for some reason.

464
00:29:55,667 --> 00:29:59,043
Rym: you know it was weird As a kid when I didn't really understand how this stuff worked.

465
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:10,459
Rym: I remember playing gauntlet and thinking that The maps were so poorly put together and so glitchy and so crappy That I didn't feel like I was exploring anything.

466
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,149
Rym: I felt like it was a race against the game glitching me to death.

467
00:30:14,651 --> 00:30:15,517
Scott: That's sort of true.

468
00:30:15,819 --> 00:30:22,390
Rym: the arcade was a little less glitch than the NES Especially gauntlet 2 where as far as I could tell you get five or six levels in and then it would just be random.

469
00:30:22,471 --> 00:30:23,602
Scott: Bullshit it was random.

470
00:30:23,622 --> 00:30:24,390
Scott: We just looked that up.

471
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:28,310
Rym: Yeah, but eventually you hit a level where there's just like you just couldn't win.

472
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:32,774
Rym: I just beat like I'd start and there's walls around me and no secrets And then I would die.

473
00:30:32,854 --> 00:30:34,240
Scott: well the thing the thing about gauntlet.

474
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:43,333
Scott: right the reason it was primarily an arcade game is because Basically you had health and as you played even if you didn't fight any bad guys You just stood still.

475
00:30:43,674 --> 00:30:48,250
Scott: your health was constantly going down, and you could put in quarters to make your health go up.

476
00:30:48,652 --> 00:30:51,850
Scott: It was the ultimate quarter munching designed game.

477
00:30:51,971 --> 00:30:57,080
Scott: It's like if you're playing Zelda and your hearts always went down And you can make him go up by putting in a quarter.

478
00:30:57,441 --> 00:31:00,737
Scott: the only other way to make him go up was by touching food But there was always a risk.

479
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,165
Scott: the food would get shot.

480
00:31:02,185 --> 00:31:13,872
Rym: of course that Aspect of it was what made it great at home and in the arcade because you'd play for a while And you know you'd be trying to succeed, but eventually you'd get to that point where Even

481
00:31:13,973 --> 00:31:24,410
Scott: if you're playing perfectly and killing all the bad guys and getting all the treasures There's not enough food to just as to keep you alive And it takes time to play it and your health goes down.

482
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,896
Scott: But eventually you're gonna die.

483
00:31:25,957 --> 00:31:28,810
Rym: eventually warrior takes the food that wizard needed to survive.

484
00:31:29,352 --> 00:31:35,350
Rym: So wizard doesn't save warrior from death and then warrior pushes wizard into the next three deaths.

485
00:31:35,974 --> 00:31:36,901
Rym: Then wizard dies.

486
00:31:36,921 --> 00:31:37,969
Rym: then warrior dies.

487
00:31:39,572 --> 00:31:40,577
Scott: Yeah, it's like Rym.

488
00:31:40,638 --> 00:31:41,985
Scott: It's if you don't try to win.

489
00:31:42,045 --> 00:31:42,769
Scott: That's what happens.

490
00:31:43,111 --> 00:31:47,064
Rym: Well the thing is Scott always wanted to play the wizard the wussy-ass wizard

491
00:31:47,365 --> 00:31:53,182
Scott: because the wizard had could shoot And if the wizard used the magic he cleared out a lot more bad guys, but

492
00:31:53,222 --> 00:31:58,415
Rym: the warrior was so strong and while he was slower Warrior could always push the wizard.

493
00:31:58,977 --> 00:32:01,445
Rym: so we'd play for like a half hour at RIT.

494
00:32:01,465 --> 00:32:02,047
Scott: That's another thing.

495
00:32:02,067 --> 00:32:03,030
Scott: that was bullshit, right?

496
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:03,877
Scott: It's like okay.

497
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,209
Scott: The warrior is strong.

498
00:32:05,431 --> 00:32:06,636
Scott: He's always strong.

499
00:32:06,856 --> 00:32:07,077
Scott: right?

500
00:32:07,218 --> 00:32:10,210
Scott: you have the Wizards net the Warriors never in a bad situation.

501
00:32:10,734 --> 00:32:12,990
Rym: The the wizard can be in a bad situation.

502
00:32:13,151 --> 00:32:18,749
Scott: Yeah, but the wizard has this magic that's wicked powerful and is the only way to get rid of death if he shows up.

503
00:32:20,391 --> 00:32:28,170
Scott: but if The Grim Reaper, I'm sorry, but if the you only can cast a magic spell if you have a potion wasn't it?

504
00:32:28,371 --> 00:32:29,479
Rym: I thought it was just called death.

505
00:32:30,244 --> 00:32:30,547
Scott: I don't know.

506
00:32:30,587 --> 00:32:36,010
Rym: It doesn't matter I'm pretty sure it was called but if you get the potion well it was called it and death was called death.

507
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:41,528
Scott: Yes, if you use up all your potions the wizard is completely useless because he's now just sort of.

508
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:42,993
Scott: you know Does that magic?

509
00:32:43,034 --> 00:32:47,490
Scott: so if death shows up and you don't have any potions you did it to run away?

510
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:49,740
Rym: I just remember this one time Scott and I were playing.

511
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,490
Rym: no one else wanted to play because I had a four score.

512
00:32:51,872 --> 00:32:53,117
Rym: I haven't brought it to RIT.

513
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:54,483
Rym: We just didn't really use it.

514
00:32:54,503 --> 00:32:55,427
Scott: I don't remember seeing it.

515
00:32:55,728 --> 00:32:56,150
Rym: It was there.

516
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:57,495
Rym: I've got it around the house somewhere.

517
00:32:57,595 --> 00:32:58,237
Scott: I've never seen it.

518
00:32:58,418 --> 00:33:00,344
Rym: I owned every four score game.

519
00:33:00,826 --> 00:33:01,950
Scott: I've never seen this four score.

520
00:33:02,754 --> 00:33:05,810
Rym: Anyway, they were almost all terrible except for the racing game.

521
00:33:05,971 --> 00:33:08,530
Rym: Yep, but you know we were playing for like a half hour 20.

522
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:09,235
Rym: I forget exactly how.

523
00:33:09,355 --> 00:33:11,730
Scott: the four score for the original Gameboy.

524
00:33:12,612 --> 00:33:20,530
Rym: No, I remember I never knew anyone when I was young who was cool who owned a Gameboy other than me one time.

525
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:21,273
Rym: Everyone owned.

526
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:29,848
Scott: one time when I was on a field trip in elementary school Someone had the Gameboy four player and they're playing that f1 game.

527
00:33:30,794 --> 00:33:32,750
Rym: See I was desperate.

528
00:33:33,071 --> 00:33:36,646
Rym: I was desperate for most of my childhood to find anyone cool.

529
00:33:37,008 --> 00:33:53,804
Rym: and by cool I define that as anyone who owned either a combination of a Gameboy and hunt for the red October and the link cable or Crystal warriors a game gear and the link cable because those games both had awesome Multiplayer that I never in my life was able to play.

530
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,675
Scott: not once not eat Your brother get another one.

531
00:33:56,775 --> 00:33:59,864
Rym: and then we had one Gameboy and one game gear.

532
00:34:00,005 --> 00:34:01,830
Scott: in my household get another Gameboy.

533
00:34:02,313 --> 00:34:03,038
Rym: We didn't have money.

534
00:34:03,058 --> 00:34:04,869
Rym: I was I was in like middle school.

535
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,946
Scott: You could have gotten two game boys instead of the game gear.

536
00:34:07,228 --> 00:34:08,815
Rym: now We wanted the game gear more.

537
00:34:08,835 --> 00:34:12,850
Rym: we got the game boy later two game gears then now because we couldn't afford two game gears.

538
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:15,438
Rym: Anyway, plus we had all right.

539
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:18,248
Rym: I did not realize that hunt for the red October would exist.

540
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:25,330
Rym: Anyway, yeah, but at one point we're walking and Scott's behind me and this death is chasing us.

541
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:27,538
Rym: we don't have any potions and I'm like he.

542
00:34:27,558 --> 00:34:34,483
Rym: Scott's like go go go, but I'm slower than him and He starts to go around me to leave me to my fate with death.

543
00:34:34,543 --> 00:34:35,626
Rym: and I realized wait a minute.

544
00:34:36,128 --> 00:34:38,010
Rym: Wait a minute I'm a warrior.

545
00:34:38,513 --> 00:34:45,083
Rym: so I stood in the middle wouldn't let him get past me and Waited for death sweet death to eat itself on Scott.

546
00:34:45,103 --> 00:34:46,889
Scott: and then we continued and there was nowhere to run.

547
00:34:47,532 --> 00:34:51,710
Rym: And then for the next five minutes I proceeded to push Scott into every death we came across.

548
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:55,449
Scott: Yeah, for some reason the warrior can push the wizard and the wizard can't push back.

549
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:59,685
Scott: So if there wasn't like a place to run away to I really had no choice.

550
00:34:59,745 --> 00:35:04,120
Scott: and where I went and if I didn't have Any magic death would always come and get me.

551
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,190
Rym: the game was basically green wizard needs food badly.

552
00:35:07,491 --> 00:35:08,576
Rym: Red warrior shot the food.

553
00:35:08,617 --> 00:35:09,762
Rym: red warrior shot the food.

554
00:35:10,003 --> 00:35:11,350
Rym: green wizard is about to die.

555
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:14,329
Rym: Red warrior shot the food.

556
00:35:15,851 --> 00:35:17,735
Scott: You Couldn't play to win could you?

557
00:35:18,457 --> 00:35:19,481
Rym: ah, there's no way to win.

558
00:35:19,501 --> 00:35:20,424
Rym: that game goes on forever.

559
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:21,467
Rym: It goes on forever.

560
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:23,816
Scott: Yes, the other gauntlets are beautiful.

561
00:35:23,957 --> 00:35:24,719
Rym: call it one.

562
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:26,888
Rym: You can actually beat go online.

563
00:35:26,908 --> 00:35:31,360
Rym: Look on YouTube You'll see what it ends with and let me tell you that is not worth it.

564
00:35:31,661 --> 00:35:32,303
Rym: Good God.

565
00:35:32,503 --> 00:35:41,250
Scott: No, but actually in the arcade When you know later on think there was a gauntlet legends in the arcade was actually a 3d gauntlet game.

566
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:42,545
Scott: The game was itself wasn't 3d.

567
00:35:42,971 --> 00:35:45,054
Scott: It's still played 2d But 3d graphics.

568
00:35:45,094 --> 00:35:52,070
Rym: that game had all the character model all the lack of fun of the original gauntlet But without any of the charm and with added complexity.

569
00:35:52,431 --> 00:35:55,986
Scott: Well, it was weird cuz like I played in the arcade and for some reason it was fun.

570
00:35:56,026 --> 00:35:56,869
Scott: then, you know.

571
00:35:57,171 --> 00:35:59,909
Scott: And the thing was in the arcade you could save your game.

572
00:36:00,432 --> 00:36:04,990
Scott: So I saved my game on the local arcade machine and I would go back and I would play it every once in a while.

573
00:36:05,112 --> 00:36:05,969
Scott: There would up my guy.

574
00:36:06,091 --> 00:36:08,010
Scott: I remember this was level up and stuff.

575
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:08,854
Rym: That was before.

576
00:36:08,914 --> 00:36:12,770
Rym: games like initial D were really available where you had like cards or something you could save.

577
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:16,402
Scott: Yeah, this you just put in your initials and it loaded up a game.

578
00:36:16,823 --> 00:36:17,284
Rym: a bunch of game.

579
00:36:17,324 --> 00:36:18,909
Rym: police 9-1-1 had that dude, isn't it?

580
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:20,113
Scott: I don't remember.

581
00:36:20,173 --> 00:36:21,239
Rym: maybe that was later though.

582
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:24,529
Rym: But anyway, I Forgot where I was going with now.

583
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:30,170
Scott: So then we got this gauntlet legends the same game for the n64 and that had four controllers.

584
00:36:30,291 --> 00:36:31,737
Scott: so me and my brother and two friends.

585
00:36:31,778 --> 00:36:34,149
Scott: we'd always play that and it was like wicked fun.

586
00:36:34,169 --> 00:36:42,846
Scott: and Then so when I got the GameCube at RIT, I bought gauntlet, you know The next gauntlet for the GameCube and for some reason it wasn't fun anymore.

587
00:36:42,866 --> 00:36:43,689
Scott: No one wanted to play it.

588
00:36:44,795 --> 00:36:45,669
Scott: I don't know what it was.

589
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:50,748
Scott: You wanted to play it with people cuz I remembered having such good times with it in high school on the on the n64.

590
00:36:51,391 --> 00:36:54,730
Scott: So I figured well, I'll have the same good times in the GameCube.

591
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:55,674
Rym: Well, I remember you were like.

592
00:36:55,735 --> 00:36:56,137
Rym: I got it.

593
00:36:56,177 --> 00:37:06,053
Rym: I was like, okay and we sat down to play it and five minutes later I realized that all I was doing was holding right and a at the same time and occasionally I would hold up an Robotron controls.

594
00:37:06,315 --> 00:37:08,945
Scott: so you're shooting with one stick and moving with the other.

595
00:37:09,226 --> 00:37:10,170
Rym: didn't matter at all.

596
00:37:10,371 --> 00:37:11,701
Rym: You basically just walked in shot.

597
00:37:11,721 --> 00:37:12,385
Rym: There was no puzzle.

598
00:37:12,406 --> 00:37:12,909
Rym: There was nothing.

599
00:37:13,411 --> 00:37:13,832
Scott: Oh, there were.

600
00:37:13,892 --> 00:37:14,514
Scott: there were puzzles.

601
00:37:14,614 --> 00:37:15,056
Scott: at least.

602
00:37:15,096 --> 00:37:22,182
Rym: the original gauntlet was so crappy just due to the limitations of the technology that you forgave It for the fact that it was basically not a game.

603
00:37:22,202 --> 00:37:29,950
Scott: Yeah But yeah now I sort of realized, you know the badness of gauntlet and it's hard to play it now.

604
00:37:30,211 --> 00:37:37,236
Rym: I was into the arcade game though for a little while at RIT because when we first got to RIT I remember they they had a night.

605
00:37:37,277 --> 00:37:38,220
Rym: the arcade was free.

606
00:37:38,301 --> 00:37:47,453
Rym: You could go in swipe your card and get infinite tokens Mmm, so I got infinite tokens and I. we kept playing gauntlet and I saved my game and I was leveling up and doing all that stuff.

607
00:37:47,857 --> 00:37:56,498
Rym: and one day like a week later I went into the arcade and I swept my card and I saw that it had debited money from my flex account And I was like what?

608
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:59,530
Rym: and I went up to the guy and he's like, why did this take money from me?

609
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,018
Rym: He was like you thought free play would last forever.

610
00:38:02,038 --> 00:38:04,747
Rym: Yeah, and I never played gauntlet again.

611
00:38:04,767 --> 00:38:11,320
Rym: Yeah Yeah, it was basically worth zero to me Words, but if it's zero you'll play.

612
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:11,983
Scott: of course.

613
00:38:12,003 --> 00:38:12,948
Rym: that was that not anymore.

614
00:38:13,008 --> 00:38:17,470
Rym: back then I would remember RIT was the time in our lives when we had infinite free time, but no money.

615
00:38:17,792 --> 00:38:20,110
Rym: Yeah now I have infinite money, but no free time.

616
00:38:20,411 --> 00:38:30,550
Scott: It's strange now that I'm beginning to see like the connection between games like rogue net hack Right gauntlet and Diablo and they're all sort of like these similar games.

617
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:42,309
Scott: It's all about there's a dungeon you're exploring the dungeon right and you're simultaneously fighting the bad guys and that's real and getting treasure and that's and the sort of amazed to it.

618
00:38:42,329 --> 00:38:49,470
Scott: and It's weird because it's like, you know, you think the D&D based game is more like the MMO style, right?

619
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:58,619
Scott: But it's strange how the D&D the fundamentals of D&D sort of diverged into like these sort of different Gameplay types in the video game area.

620
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,870
Rym: Well, I mean remember the Dungeons & Dragons arcade game.

621
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:03,549
Scott: Well, that was just a side scroll and beat him up.

622
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:06,099
Scott: Yeah, I had some elements of D&D.

623
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:09,270
Rym: that game was actually for its time kind of awesome.

624
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:10,638
Scott: Yes, it was an alright game.

625
00:39:10,658 --> 00:39:12,409
Scott: You had some decisions to make of where to go.

626
00:39:12,678 --> 00:39:14,536
Scott: Yeah you had lots of items you could use.

627
00:39:14,576 --> 00:39:17,988
Scott: you could turn on dead infinity times and it was awesome.

628
00:39:18,028 --> 00:39:26,319
Scott: and you could Get secret doors if you have opened them up and it required some modicum of teamwork Some You had to set the troll on fire.

629
00:39:26,459 --> 00:39:28,350
Rym: Yeah, it wasn't a great game, but it was better than gauntlet.

630
00:39:28,792 --> 00:39:30,379
Scott: Yeah, it was at least really entertaining.

631
00:39:30,399 --> 00:39:32,588
Scott: I remember playing that one at the movie theater a lot.

632
00:39:32,789 --> 00:39:34,138
Rym: Yep I remember oh my god.

633
00:39:34,258 --> 00:39:46,025
Rym: after a science Olympiad competition Yeah I was in like seventh grade and we stopped at this pizza joint on the way home the whole team and they had the D&D Machine the it was the cocktail cabinet version.

634
00:39:46,327 --> 00:39:48,275
Scott: Oh, wow I've never seen such a thing.

635
00:39:48,335 --> 00:39:52,670
Rym: so us kids stayed there for two hours to the chagrin of our parents who wouldn't you know?

636
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:59,261
Rym: We could they couldn't make us leave and we took turns and we were almost at the end of the game and Someone I ran out of money.

637
00:39:59,664 --> 00:40:00,248
Rym: I won't say who?

638
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:08,969
Rym: Someone it was me bumped into the power cable That was actually barely plugged in but none of us noticed the whole time.

639
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:12,785
Rym: It's how I was playing and I kind of bumped into with my foot and it fell out and the game stopped.

640
00:40:13,468 --> 00:40:18,128
Rym: and there was this silence followed by a cry that I've never heard since.

641
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:20,760
Scott: That's a good start.

642
00:40:20,821 --> 00:40:21,630
Rym: No one knew it was me.

643
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:25,270
Scott: I never fessed up, you know, that would be a lot worse if it was a gauntlet game.

644
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:26,923
Scott: We're like level 200 something.

645
00:40:27,285 --> 00:40:32,526
Rym: Oh my god Man, there's that YouTube video of a perfect score run of gauntlet 2.

646
00:40:32,526 --> 00:40:43,423
Rym: Wow I watched the end of part 23 of Mmm, I also found a question someone asked online of does gauntlet 2 end?

647
00:40:44,165 --> 00:40:45,108
Rym: and no one answered it.

648
00:40:45,489 --> 00:40:51,990
Scott: Wow Yeah, I don't know gauntlet is strange and that it has some things that like were invented in gauntlet that were really good.

649
00:40:52,432 --> 00:40:54,460
Scott: I mean like the bad guys spigot.

650
00:40:54,561 --> 00:40:56,690
Scott: they sort of invented that in gauntlet.

651
00:40:56,871 --> 00:41:01,151
Rym: Yep, and the game just for you know for a young kid in that era of game It was.

652
00:41:01,312 --> 00:41:05,289
Rym: it was a game that could only exist in the form it did in the era that it did.

653
00:41:05,894 --> 00:41:13,310
Rym: but at the same time games that are Fundamentally the same but just have basically they add a bunch of fluff on top of what is basically just gauntlet.

654
00:41:14,612 --> 00:41:19,556
Scott: Can't tell you how many times a new game comes out and I'm like, oh that's just gauntlet You know, it is like.

655
00:41:19,596 --> 00:41:20,239
Rym: it's not even like.

656
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,726
Rym: oh you're just saying that it's just like.

657
00:41:21,746 --> 00:41:23,781
Scott: the only difference I mean Diablo and gauntlet.

658
00:41:23,862 --> 00:41:24,770
Scott: is that Diablo?

659
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:28,077
Scott: Doesn't have the robotron control style.

660
00:41:28,158 --> 00:41:32,269
Scott: It has the click on the bad guy a whole bunch of times control style.

661
00:41:32,611 --> 00:41:33,655
Scott: That's really the only difference.

662
00:41:33,715 --> 00:41:36,146
Rym: gauntlet 4 even had going to town and buy shit.

663
00:41:36,668 --> 00:41:47,852
Rym: Yeah Yeah, but gauntlet also had a little bit of that four swords element Especially gauntlet 2 because every now and then a level would start and it would say things like your shots hurt the other players Wink wink.

664
00:41:48,394 --> 00:41:53,550
Rym: Yeah, and like if a power-up was there only one person could get it plus the brilliance of it.

665
00:41:54,193 --> 00:42:03,110
Scott: Yeah, it was sort of like this really unpolished, you know, I mean Basically, you know, there's the new Mario game coming out for the the Wii that they're all pushing now, right?

666
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:06,309
Scott: That's gonna that they promoted big at e3 for Mario's.

667
00:42:06,591 --> 00:42:12,434
Scott: They're talking all about you know, the competitive cooperative where you're cooperating to beat the game But you're also competing.

668
00:42:12,474 --> 00:42:16,330
Scott: now see which of you is better than the other never mind the fact that Nintendo.

669
00:42:16,612 --> 00:42:22,870
Scott: They're acting like they just invented it But even though they invented it with four swords and crystal chronicles and crystal chronicles, right?

670
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:26,288
Scott: And well crystal chronicles didn't really have the competitive part.

671
00:42:26,348 --> 00:42:31,466
Rym: Yes Cooperative it had the competitive part in that everyone had their goal their secret goal.

672
00:42:31,747 --> 00:42:32,109
Scott: All right.

673
00:42:32,129 --> 00:42:32,470
Scott: You're right.

674
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:35,210
Rym: Yeah, yeah, and you got items based on that at the end of every mission.

675
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:40,146
Scott: Yeah, but you know gauntlet sort of had that only unpolished, you know.

676
00:42:40,247 --> 00:42:49,030
Scott: in that, you know You were cooperating to beat the game but you're competing, you know yet score first of all who got the high score and You wanted to get more food.

677
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:55,409
Scott: You wanted to take food away from other people's that you know You would live longer and have to pay less quarters and death would come.

678
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:56,279
Rym: Yeah, you did.

679
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:58,735
Rym: if you didn't have potions Someone was getting it.

680
00:42:58,836 --> 00:43:05,630
Scott: Someone was taking one for you want that to be someone else and not you And if someone else is gonna grab the food shoot that food.

681
00:43:05,951 --> 00:43:11,310
Scott: You don't want them to eat the food because then they're basically getting free money in terms of quarters.

682
00:43:14,032 --> 00:43:14,716
Scott: Exactly.

683
00:43:14,797 --> 00:43:18,932
Scott: and that's you know, what gauntlet was about Wasn't I?

684
00:43:18,972 --> 00:43:19,995
Rym: just I don't know.

685
00:43:20,236 --> 00:43:26,562
Rym: the game is really at the core of a lot of popular games today and I That you know, it's not like.

686
00:43:26,582 --> 00:43:27,430
Rym: I've realized this now.

687
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:36,460
Rym: I've always realized this but the reason I'm so disillusioned with a lot of gaming today And the reason I look at a lot of new games and like I play five minutes I'm immediately done with them.

688
00:43:36,521 --> 00:43:42,830
Rym: Just can't enjoy them at all Is that almost every game that comes out is at its core identical to a game?

689
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:46,162
Rym: I already played the fullness of when I was like 11.

690
00:43:46,162 --> 00:43:48,070
Scott: Yep, and gauntlet is off in that game.

691
00:43:48,571 --> 00:43:54,446
Scott: Yep, I mean just try to name some of the games that are basically gauntlet World of Warcraft.

692
00:43:54,927 --> 00:43:59,440
Rym: Oh No World of Warcraft is beyond that World of Warcraft.

693
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:07,383
Scott: Yeah, it's definitely mud, you know, it's sort of like, you know They're all these sort of things that evolved from the D&D based video.

694
00:44:07,523 --> 00:44:10,090
Rym: Look muds were stateful gauntlet was stateless.

695
00:44:10,491 --> 00:44:11,275
Scott: Yeah, the muds.

696
00:44:11,296 --> 00:44:11,899
Scott: Yeah, the mud.

697
00:44:11,919 --> 00:44:16,503
Scott: you had the mud Jenner you had the mud Genre, you had the gauntlet genre.

698
00:44:16,544 --> 00:44:22,710
Scott: you had the sort of Dungeon master gold box kind of genre in another direction, you know.

699
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:30,219
Scott: They're all these sort of different kinds of play styles that came out of the D&D Idea and gauntlet is just one of those.

700
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:30,299
Scott: Yep.

701
00:44:30,681 --> 00:44:31,967
Rym: I don't know.

702
00:44:32,067 --> 00:44:32,650
Rym: I think we're done.

703
00:44:33,072 --> 00:44:36,790
Rym: I don't know what else I can say about gauntlet other than green wizard shot the food.

704
00:44:37,172 --> 00:44:40,570
Rym: Yeah, that voice was so awesome when I was a kid coming out of my NES.

705
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:44,150
Scott: I mean, it's like even though the game is bad that voice is still famous.

706
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:46,557
Scott: I mean, you know, it's like you think about it.

707
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:54,219
Scott: back in the day so few games had digitized voice and those that did Anything that the digitized voice said became famous.

708
00:44:54,299 --> 00:45:00,775
Scott: I mean everything sinistar said is fun run run run Castle to stay alive.

709
00:45:00,915 --> 00:45:06,790
Scott: Yeah, I mean job red commander any video game from that era that talked because so few of them talked.

710
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:09,917
Scott: Everything it said became like a famous quote.

711
00:45:10,038 --> 00:45:17,050
Rym: I remember when I buy now video games like full voice acting and I Remember when I bought tie fighter.

712
00:45:17,171 --> 00:45:28,149
Rym: I didn't even have x-wing but it was the first like big iron Computer game that I bought as opposed to pirated Yeah, and I also didn't have a working sound card for a long time up until that point.

713
00:45:28,832 --> 00:45:32,924
Rym: So I got tie fighter and that MIDI of star wars starts playing.

714
00:45:33,305 --> 00:45:35,439
Rym: I'm thinking like yeah, this is awesome This is awesome.

715
00:45:35,459 --> 00:45:36,069
Rym: This is awesome.

716
00:45:36,672 --> 00:45:46,449
Rym: And then Darth Vader looks at me and says signal vice admiral thon thron to have his tie squadron sent immediately And I was like, oh my god, it talked.

717
00:45:48,492 --> 00:45:51,087
Rym: That game talking was like the biggest thing ever.

718
00:45:51,147 --> 00:46:02,520
Rym: and now You know one thing I can say to the voice acting and a lot of early games was a lot better than the voice acting now Tie fighter sounded exactly like people in Star Wars.

719
00:46:02,841 --> 00:46:07,898
Scott: Yeah, but I'm saying I'm talking about things like wing commander Which is bad acting period yeah.

720
00:46:07,918 --> 00:46:08,139
Rym: Yeah.

721
00:46:08,339 --> 00:46:11,650
Rym: Well, maybe it's just tie fighter had good voice acting and nothing else.

722
00:46:11,871 --> 00:46:12,272
Scott: Oh, you know what?
