00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,207
Scott: It's Thursday November 15th.

2
00:00:11,588 --> 00:00:12,210
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:13,293
Rym: I'm really tired.

4
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:14,818
Scott: Me too, and this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:23,733
Scott: Tonight, Telogical Fallacies Teh?

6
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:25,388
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:29,412 --> 00:00:30,939
Rym: Well this weekend ought to be interesting.

8
00:00:30,979 --> 00:00:37,490
Rym: We're uh for the first time in a long time We're going to some other geek house instead of having people at our geek house.

9
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:44,497
Scott: I try to avoid doing that as much as possible because it usually means I'm gonna have to sleep on the floor and The days of sleeping on the floor are done for me.

10
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:45,941
Scott: It's bad or nothing.

11
00:00:46,322 --> 00:00:54,050
Rym: See, but the thing is in return for sleeping on The floor what we get is a weekend full of geekery with all our friends and all the Visigoths.

12
00:00:55,072 --> 00:00:55,939
Rym: No mess to clean up.

13
00:00:55,999 --> 00:00:57,026
Rym: No responsibilities.

14
00:00:57,087 --> 00:00:57,510
Rym: No nothing.

15
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:00,077
Scott: But I have to drive for hours.

16
00:01:00,097 --> 00:01:00,679
Rym: No you don't.

17
00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:05,253
Rym: You have to sit in a car playing worms with me while Alex drives Maybe.

18
00:01:05,453 --> 00:01:07,782
Rym: Or you can drive and me and Alex can play worms.

19
00:01:08,124 --> 00:01:15,416
Scott: Yeah, either way It's I got to sit in a car and then like all my all the stuff I want to do in this house.

20
00:01:15,476 --> 00:01:15,999
Scott: I can't do.

21
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:16,824
Rym: I can't even sit in my chair.

22
00:01:16,844 --> 00:01:17,307
Rym: See, that's the point.

23
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:17,850
Rym: We get away.

24
00:01:18,152 --> 00:01:19,441
Rym: So bring the chair with you.

25
00:01:19,461 --> 00:01:20,790
Scott: That's not gonna happen.

26
00:01:21,671 --> 00:01:22,635
Scott: Let someone vomit on it.

27
00:01:22,876 --> 00:01:23,880
Rym: That's kind of the point though.

28
00:01:23,901 --> 00:01:30,498
Rym: by getting out of the house like that like when I'm here I always think well, I could work on all that GeekNights stuff I've been shit talking about for the last two years.

29
00:01:30,578 --> 00:01:32,446
Rym: or I could do this or I could do that.

30
00:01:32,506 --> 00:01:33,691
Rym: if I had someone else's House.

31
00:01:33,912 --> 00:01:44,737
Rym: I wake up and not only do I have zero responsibility to anyone in the world Not only can I do make whatever mess I want do whatever I want There's no chance.

32
00:01:44,778 --> 00:01:46,190
Rym: I'll get worked on so I don't even think about it.

33
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,841
Scott: See my problem is I take it a step further.

34
00:01:47,861 --> 00:01:49,351
Scott: when I wake up in someone else's house I go.

35
00:01:49,371 --> 00:01:50,378
Scott: why the fuck did I come here?

36
00:01:50,418 --> 00:01:51,908
Scott: I could have stayed home and worked on my stuff.

37
00:01:54,091 --> 00:02:04,117
Rym: But this will be fun also because uh Let's just say the place where you're going and the event that is happening is one of those Kind of not what you'd expect us to go to.

38
00:02:04,218 --> 00:02:07,849
Rym: it's a. I think Bach and Elle might be the word I would use.

39
00:02:08,572 --> 00:02:10,238
Scott: I don't know how much of a bucket L will be.

40
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:15,723
Rym: well if tails from the previous event That was much like this are not exactly.

41
00:02:15,864 --> 00:02:17,793
Rym: Yeah, cuz neither Scott I have also.

42
00:02:17,913 --> 00:02:22,230
Scott: I have heard tale though that the the worst offenders are not are not gonna be there.

43
00:02:22,692 --> 00:02:25,745
Rym: Yeah, it'll be tough to say it's a tough call.

44
00:02:25,786 --> 00:02:26,770
Scott: You'll hear more next week.

45
00:02:26,991 --> 00:02:31,670
Rym: Yes, but I can guarantee that if anyone's gonna be dry heaving it's not gonna be us.

46
00:02:32,131 --> 00:02:34,581
Scott: No, I will definitely not be the any heaving.

47
00:02:35,123 --> 00:02:38,616
Scott: So speaking of dry heaves This is nothing to do with dry heaves.

48
00:02:38,636 --> 00:02:39,178
Rym: Yes, it does.

49
00:02:39,198 --> 00:02:40,362
Scott: Oh, yeah.

50
00:02:40,463 --> 00:02:40,764
Rym: Okay.

51
00:02:40,804 --> 00:02:42,350
Rym: All right, you think I'd all right.

52
00:02:43,011 --> 00:02:44,522
Scott: So you work dry heaves into whatever.

53
00:02:44,562 --> 00:02:45,710
Scott: your news is absinthe.

54
00:02:46,732 --> 00:02:52,402
Rym: Okay, it's kind of worries that I'm not gonna get into all the details here because you probably don't care.

55
00:02:52,562 --> 00:02:56,201
Rym: absinthe is a very alcoholic liquor that Tastes pretty good.

56
00:02:56,221 --> 00:02:58,985
Rym: If you like anis Anis you mean anus?

57
00:03:00,114 --> 00:03:02,114
Rym: No, I mean anis You know licorice.

58
00:03:02,134 --> 00:03:07,505
Rym: I'm gonna taste like ass I'm sure you would know.

59
00:03:10,111 --> 00:03:17,710
Rym: Yeah, if you can't tell guys we're tired tonight and we had a lot of stuff to do I was falling asleep on the train and while reading manga so that tells you something.

60
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:18,574
Rym: That's the worst.

61
00:03:18,594 --> 00:03:28,832
Scott: when you're reading a book or something and then you suddenly realize because I was reading frickin massive Mooney Shiro's crazy nutjob footnotes in the bottom of ghost in the shell one and a half in the tiny text and I Was falling.

62
00:03:28,873 --> 00:03:29,595
Scott: I just got trapped.

63
00:03:29,615 --> 00:03:33,670
Scott: I'm like, I'm gonna read this one footnote and then go and then doze off.

64
00:03:34,112 --> 00:03:36,487
Scott: I couldn't finish the footnote like my eyes would not stay.

65
00:03:36,567 --> 00:03:37,030
Rym: it was worse.

66
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:42,050
Rym: I had that thing where you read and read and read and then you realize like I don't remember what I just read.

67
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:47,370
Rym: Yeah Start backtracking back and realize that I flipped like 15 pages and didn't remember our goddamn thing.

68
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:51,290
Scott: I hate that when you're reading read and read but your brain like sort of doesn't actually process the words.

69
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,360
Scott: You just sort of process them only with the eyeballs.

70
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,043
Rym: I think it tricks you.

71
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,370
Rym: I think the brain is like, you know what?

72
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:56,510
Rym: He's too tired to notice.

73
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,115
Scott: It's like you know I'm totally gonna just have.

74
00:03:58,135 --> 00:04:00,526
Scott: it's like you need two parts of your brain to read.

75
00:04:00,546 --> 00:04:06,295
Scott: you need the part that Processes the words and you need the part that actually turns the words like imagination and imagery.

76
00:04:06,616 --> 00:04:07,639
Scott: and it's like you can use.

77
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:12,978
Scott: you can do one without the other and when you do that you end up Flipping a lot of pages in the book without actually getting.

78
00:04:13,018 --> 00:04:14,363
Rym: I think it's simpler to go back.

79
00:04:14,383 --> 00:04:17,516
Rym: brain says he won't know He's not paying attention.

80
00:04:17,555 --> 00:04:20,269
Scott: I ain't doing work and then it figures itself out.

81
00:04:22,631 --> 00:04:23,916
Scott: Well, I caught you brain.

82
00:04:24,518 --> 00:04:26,466
Rym: Oh brain I got you.

83
00:04:26,486 --> 00:04:27,510
Scott: the brain catches itself.

84
00:04:27,711 --> 00:04:42,230
Rym: But yeah, it looks like absinthe is now less illegal in the United States Which is good news for one really important reason All the reasons that the government has given over the years to make absinthe illegal are completely made up bullshit.

85
00:04:42,631 --> 00:04:46,120
Rym: Absinthe is just a really alcoholic beverage that tastes pretty good.

86
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,684
Rym: If you like that licorice.

87
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,250
Rym: I mean, I like Sambuca a lot.

88
00:04:51,612 --> 00:05:02,596
Rym: of course a lot of people make the mistake of drinking absinthe as it is without diluting it in water, but people drink laudanum also, I Hear laudanum tastes terrible.

89
00:05:02,877 --> 00:05:03,840
Scott: Yeah, well people drink it.

90
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,425
Rym: Also who drinks laudanum.

91
00:05:05,966 --> 00:05:06,127
Scott: Yeah.

92
00:05:06,147 --> 00:05:06,969
Scott: I know a lot of people.

93
00:05:06,989 --> 00:05:12,046
Rym: Oh You know one person who's not even real aka captain laudanum.

94
00:05:12,388 --> 00:05:12,809
Scott: That's right.

95
00:05:13,031 --> 00:05:15,930
Scott: But now captain laudanum it drinks enough laudanum for ten men.

96
00:05:16,292 --> 00:05:25,914
Rym: This is a step in the right direction because the government always said yeah Absinthe we're banning it because it makes people crazy and it's hallucinogen and it's a drug and it's got through Joan in it Causes through Joan.

97
00:05:26,115 --> 00:05:28,000
Rym: Yeah, that was totally made up.

98
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,990
Rym: absinthe has no effects other than just being alcoholic.

99
00:05:32,772 --> 00:05:34,386
Scott: Really is worth alcoholic.

100
00:05:34,406 --> 00:05:37,197
Rym: Yeah Yeah, it's not even close to Everclear.

101
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,360
Scott: Is it more than Vodak?

102
00:05:38,901 --> 00:05:39,202
Rym: Yes.

103
00:05:39,343 --> 00:05:39,704
Scott: Okay.

104
00:05:39,764 --> 00:05:40,726
Scott: It's like double Vodak.

105
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:45,398
Rym: It's usually about 120 proof so it's double Vodak.

106
00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:46,040
Rym: Yeah.

107
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,590
Scott: Alright, so if you just well not quite double.

108
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:53,010
Scott: So if you just use half as much absinthe as you normally use Vodak, you'll be alright.

109
00:05:53,672 --> 00:05:57,284
Rym: Well, you're supposed to drink absinthe diluted in water possibly with sugar.

110
00:05:57,304 --> 00:05:58,147
Rym: Okay.

111
00:05:58,589 --> 00:06:00,741
Rym: Yeah But I like this.

112
00:06:00,781 --> 00:06:01,830
Rym: it's a step in the right direction.

113
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:10,677
Rym: It means that someone has convinced the government a little bit to go back on an absolutely stupid and meaningless decision They made to arbitrarily ban something.

114
00:06:10,717 --> 00:06:14,594
Scott: There's no reason to ban it or maybe there was a time limit on the old thing And it ran out.

115
00:06:14,755 --> 00:06:27,861
Rym: I know it had more to do with the fact that Manufacturers and foreign countries that wanted to really start selling it out here and people who realize they can make money selling absinthe on the mystique that it gained when Moulin Rouge came out and a bunch of kids went.

116
00:06:28,223 --> 00:06:29,470
Rym: oh, I want to get me some of that.

117
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:31,694
Rym: Great cuz absinthe.

118
00:06:31,714 --> 00:06:37,846
Rym: there's all this mystique around it and it's just a really alcoholic licorice drink my prediction vomiting.

119
00:06:39,451 --> 00:06:39,913
Rym: I imagine.

120
00:06:39,973 --> 00:06:50,290
Rym: all the people who are actually gonna drink it are gonna drink it because they want to like they want to be one of those people who drinks absinthe and I think they'll be disavowed of that obsession rather quickly when they taste it.

121
00:06:50,691 --> 00:06:53,981
Scott: It is shall we say it takes a special kind of person to drink.

122
00:06:54,363 --> 00:06:56,690
Rym: it is an acquired taste acquired.

123
00:06:57,891 --> 00:06:59,456
Rym: Yes, that is how I would put it.

124
00:06:59,497 --> 00:07:02,146
Rym: It is it is not for one with a delicate palate.

125
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:07,602
Scott: All right, so There's a if you know the website in gadget and gadget comm.

126
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:10,010
Scott: it's the pretty much the tech blog period.

127
00:07:11,272 --> 00:07:26,619
Scott: They have every story about tech that you care about and well There's run by two people mostly with this guy named Ryan block But also this other guy named Peter Rojas, right and these guys they're both pretty Outspoken against DRM and stuff.

128
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,550
Scott: They're pretty much on the side of the consumers in all things.

129
00:07:29,771 --> 00:07:34,838
Scott: They're sort of like think of them as the gave in taiko of the technology world You know gave in taiko or the video games.

130
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,569
Scott: Ryan block and Peter Rojas are the gadgets, right?

131
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:40,316
Scott: The Peter Rojas guy he.

132
00:07:40,436 --> 00:07:44,490
Scott: today they announced that he is starting a record label.

133
00:07:45,071 --> 00:07:53,080
Scott: the record label will be called record blue RCRD space LBL all caps and That's pretty good.

134
00:07:53,100 --> 00:08:13,190
Scott: Yeah, and this record label will distribute all digital all free Streaming or download no DRM music Aha, and they already have artists such as most F block party and the stills.

135
00:08:13,531 --> 00:08:15,563
Rym: I'll admit that I've never heard of any of them.

136
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:19,528
Scott: I Think I've heard of most F but I don't think I've ever heard any of most devs.

137
00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:19,770
Scott: music.

138
00:08:19,851 --> 00:08:21,706
Scott: I've never heard of block party or the stills.

139
00:08:22,772 --> 00:08:23,353
Rym: It's a start.

140
00:08:23,554 --> 00:08:29,070
Scott: They've also partnered with some other labels like warp and dimmock, which is a pretty dumb name for record.

141
00:08:30,891 --> 00:08:34,703
Scott: So I guess whatever music whatever artists they have they're gonna partner up with.

142
00:08:34,783 --> 00:08:43,315
Scott: and I like I don't know how well this is Gonna go cuz I don't know how he's gonna make money But I I hope it works out.

143
00:08:43,355 --> 00:08:47,470
Scott: Well, and I think if they play the cards, right this could be like the record label.

144
00:08:47,753 --> 00:08:52,757
Scott: you know as the name implies and If they get some, you know good music on there.

145
00:08:52,857 --> 00:08:55,906
Scott: Well, I will be listening because I couldn't hurt.

146
00:08:56,467 --> 00:08:58,518
Scott: right free music That's how it's supposed to be.

147
00:08:58,781 --> 00:09:06,554
Rym: Yeah, uh Maybe this I mean I'd say oh this might be the start of the revolution and everything is gonna change when it comes to audio distribution.

148
00:09:06,594 --> 00:09:07,178
Rym: for real.

149
00:09:07,258 --> 00:09:16,927
Rym: but people have tried Similar things not not quite to this extent but there have been a lot of little labels that were like Yeah, we're gonna buck the trend and go with what the people want.

150
00:09:16,967 --> 00:09:19,416
Scott: Yeah to me This is this is sort of like the first.

151
00:09:19,677 --> 00:09:28,690
Scott: well, it's not the first but it's it's the first real Try like someone's actually gonna give it a full-on go and we're gonna see what happens.

152
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:34,448
Scott: So whether it succeeds or fails is not as important as whether we learn what we learn from this.

153
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,716
Scott: plus You know, it's someone awesome doing it.

154
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:48,758
Scott: So so best of luck to them I say and free music for me Even if it's cracking, huh?

155
00:09:48,998 --> 00:09:50,720
Rym: At any rate if you can't tell we're kind of tired.

156
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,490
Rym: So I think I'll just jump right into things of the day.

157
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:54,794
Scott: I'm already sleeping.

158
00:09:54,814 --> 00:09:56,340
Scott: My thing of the day should be sleep.

159
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:59,898
Scott: It is fun and nice and everybody should take extra sleep.

160
00:10:01,261 --> 00:10:03,769
Rym: So you remember the 90s?

161
00:10:04,391 --> 00:10:05,474
Rym: remember back in the 90s?

162
00:10:05,575 --> 00:10:07,260
Rym: Yeah, there were no cell phones.

163
00:10:07,862 --> 00:10:10,552
Scott: They were just expensive and large.

164
00:10:10,592 --> 00:10:12,880
Scott: well, yeah, usually they were car phones and not cell phone.

165
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,728
Rym: Well, there weren't cell phones like we have now.

166
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:15,973
Rym: No, not even close.

167
00:10:16,133 --> 00:10:16,997
Rym: I mean I had one.

168
00:10:17,037 --> 00:10:17,720
Rym: it was a big break.

169
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,645
Rym: It was totally useless.

170
00:10:18,665 --> 00:10:23,837
Rym: You could talk for 45 minutes before the battery died I know or you could put it in standby for four hours.

171
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:27,794
Scott: I know some people had car phones that were as big as regular phone.

172
00:10:27,834 --> 00:10:28,938
Rym: car phones were the late 80s.

173
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,754
Rym: Yeah, they were by 1993 or four.

174
00:10:31,774 --> 00:10:34,024
Rym: there were some cell phones But not the Verizon.

175
00:10:34,124 --> 00:10:38,075
Rym: I remember Scott and I didn't have cell phones until we were already in college.

176
00:10:38,396 --> 00:10:41,531
Scott: I had a cell phone In the year 2000.

177
00:10:41,531 --> 00:10:43,000
Rym: Yeah, that was when we went to college.

178
00:10:43,921 --> 00:10:45,266
Rym: Yeah, I think I remember it.

179
00:10:45,286 --> 00:10:45,467
Rym: didn't?

180
00:10:45,487 --> 00:10:47,154
Rym: you got it while we were in college.

181
00:10:47,395 --> 00:10:47,817
Scott: Did I?

182
00:10:47,877 --> 00:10:49,744
Rym: Yeah Cuz I remember.

183
00:10:49,804 --> 00:10:55,168
Rym: we went to get one and then you found out that you had to put a big deposit down Because your credit history wasn't long.

184
00:10:55,228 --> 00:10:57,860
Rym: Yeah, all right, you were like well screw this and he had your mom do it.

185
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,381
Scott: That's right Cuz.

186
00:10:58,422 --> 00:11:06,143
Scott: my dad got rid of his Motorola StarTech Which is still one of the best cell phones ever and then I had to go try to get it activated at the Verizon At the mall.

187
00:11:06,183 --> 00:11:10,993
Rym: In fact, we went to some of our first anime cons Without cell phones.

188
00:11:11,154 --> 00:11:11,680
Scott: Yeah, we did.

189
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:21,009
Scott: We had to get those walkie-talkies from Best Buy which suck but which became awesome because only in one instance because you see Somewhere like Otakon whenever.

190
00:11:21,371 --> 00:11:23,498
Rym: well back then which whenever amount?

191
00:11:23,518 --> 00:11:24,020
Rym: is it twice?

192
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,607
Scott: I think we should get around to the thing of the day.

193
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:25,929
Rym: Why?

194
00:11:25,949 --> 00:11:26,814
Scott: I don't know.

195
00:11:26,834 --> 00:11:28,864
Rym: I Guess I'll save the.

196
00:11:28,944 --> 00:11:31,275
Rym: it's a me a Mario story for another day before.

197
00:11:31,456 --> 00:11:32,220
Rym: a long time ago.

198
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,686
Rym: I'll bet half our listeners never heard it.

199
00:11:33,786 --> 00:11:35,132
Scott: Well, they can hear it again later.

200
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:40,453
Scott: We'll keep them enticed by something at least It's a me a Mario Right.

201
00:11:40,473 --> 00:11:44,367
Rym: So anyway Whatever my thing of the day is a video College Humor.

202
00:11:44,768 --> 00:11:50,781
Rym: What if that show 24 which I think is kind of stupid was set in 1994?

203
00:11:50,781 --> 00:11:55,279
Scott: I I don't know much about the show 24 other than it's pretty popular and I've never seen it.

204
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,853
Scott: I guess it's a lot like this video.

205
00:11:58,054 --> 00:11:58,315
Scott: Yes.

206
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:58,878
Scott: That's a guess.

207
00:11:58,918 --> 00:11:59,159
Rym: it is.

208
00:11:59,481 --> 00:12:02,432
Scott: I've seen two episodes one of them assumption to make.

209
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:11,110
Rym: I think one of them was just really Stupid and the other one really kind of glorified Overreaching anti-terrorism measures.

210
00:12:11,432 --> 00:12:13,159
Rym: and what was it?

211
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:24,914
Scott: well Anyway, the the video we just watch is really funny because it's like you see these people back with like, you know The early AOL dial-up modem technology like running into all these problems because of it.

212
00:12:24,975 --> 00:12:29,657
Scott: and it's sort of like wow That was just like not even 10 years ago.

213
00:12:31,364 --> 00:12:32,468
Rym: Think about this nowadays.

214
00:12:32,568 --> 00:12:34,314
Rym: say I'm gonna meet you and Emily in the city.

215
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:35,036
Rym: We're gonna get dinner.

216
00:12:35,638 --> 00:12:38,749
Rym: All right Say I don't show up at the restaurant.

217
00:12:39,171 --> 00:12:40,217
Rym: You call my cell phone Rym.

218
00:12:40,237 --> 00:12:40,719
Rym: Where are you?

219
00:12:41,281 --> 00:12:42,310
Rym: Hey, the six train didn't come.

220
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:46,332
Rym: I'm walking or yeah I'm in book off because I forgot to go to the restaurant.

221
00:12:46,994 --> 00:12:50,304
Rym: now back then it was Shit, where's Rym?

222
00:12:50,324 --> 00:12:51,748
Rym: I don't know.

223
00:12:52,089 --> 00:12:52,751
Rym: What do we do?

224
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:54,376
Scott: I don't know.

225
00:12:54,798 --> 00:12:55,580
Rym: How do we find him?

226
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,657
Rym: There's no way to.

227
00:12:57,441 --> 00:12:58,769
Rym: Yeah, there was no way.

228
00:12:58,789 --> 00:13:00,700
Rym: I guess I could find a payphone.

229
00:13:01,101 --> 00:13:02,346
Rym: Call the restaurant.

230
00:13:02,467 --> 00:13:05,780
Rym: if I knew the number which of course I don't I could try to look it up in the phone book.

231
00:13:06,042 --> 00:13:07,539
Rym: But where am I gonna find a phone book?

232
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:13,320
Rym: Even back then when people needed them any phone book tied to a phone booth was broken and full of penises

233
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:18,254
Scott: Missing pages because punk high school kids tore them out for their scavenger hunts like I did

234
00:13:18,676 --> 00:13:21,113
Rym: or they tore them out when they needed a number to remember or

235
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,605
Scott: toilet paper For the gas station.

236
00:13:24,128 --> 00:13:33,279
Rym: gas station has always had toilet paper as far as I was But yet self Station and on the roll of toilet paper would be the phone book.

237
00:13:33,782 --> 00:13:37,863
Rym: I'm sure some old fogies are gonna think us punk kids don't know how hard it was But you know what?

238
00:13:38,165 --> 00:13:39,553
Rym: I'm glad I don't know how hard it was.

239
00:13:39,835 --> 00:13:42,680
Rym: without my cell phone My life would be largely miserable and difficult.

240
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:47,744
Scott: Yeah, and if you're old fogies complaining about how punk kids got it easy and you had it hard in your day Well, you know what?

241
00:13:48,047 --> 00:13:52,165
Scott: You have only yourself to blame Easy what?

242
00:13:52,246 --> 00:13:54,680
Rym: wait, but you know, you could take that another way.

243
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,153
Rym: You have yourself to blame for not inventing cell phones and then making them widely distributed.

244
00:13:59,575 --> 00:14:01,139
Rym: Yeah, take that grandpa.

245
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:10,600
Scott: Well, it's like they have themselves to blame for not inventing the good stuff sooner And they also have themselves to blame for inventing the stuff and then letting us have it without having to invent it.

246
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,497
Rym: But what about the old the people who didn't invent it and didn't want it and now it's just here tough.

247
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:17,683
Rym: Okay Right.

248
00:14:17,704 --> 00:14:19,718
Scott: So what are you there fall for not preventing the invention of it?

249
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,068
Scott: Alright, so, you know those people.

250
00:14:22,108 --> 00:14:28,097
Scott: they play the miniatures games with the rulers, you know Like I like those games that people talk that someone asked us about I guess.

251
00:14:29,142 --> 00:14:40,820
Scott: But anyway, like Warhammer and stuff like that, you know people always make terrains for those games like they make hills and there's a whole hobby of just making like maps and like trees and Stuff like that and buildings.

252
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,992
Rym: It's very much related to that same thing about railroads.

253
00:14:44,072 --> 00:14:46,240
Rym: make a little model railroad with the terrain all around.

254
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,797
Rym: They use a lot of the same techniques, right?

255
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:56,955
Scott: Well, here are some pictures of some guys who made a sort of post apocalyptic city thing for their miniatures game.

256
00:14:57,016 --> 00:14:59,767
Scott: and well I'm not gonna say anything else.

257
00:14:59,787 --> 00:15:05,651
Scott: You're probably like whatever from my description, but if you look at this I think you will change your mind and go what the fuck?

258
00:15:05,732 --> 00:15:06,897
Scott: Oh my god, those guys.

259
00:15:06,977 --> 00:15:07,600
Scott: They're the crazy.

260
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:09,058
Scott: You should look at this.

261
00:15:09,861 --> 00:15:11,098
Scott: That's what else can I say?

262
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,659
Scott: Especially if you have an interest in those kind of games you this.

263
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:17,700
Scott: well This is like probably the best terrain maybe in the whole world that I've ever seen.

264
00:15:18,182 --> 00:15:27,391
Scott: Someone else are probably like now here's the best terrain and post some images, but this is the best I've seen right, so Since as you can tell we're dragging we're just getting right into it.

265
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:29,380
Rym: We've brought them up a lot.

266
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:37,140
Rym: We've talked about them on the show obliquely many times, but we've never really gone through the logical fallacies.

267
00:15:37,283 --> 00:15:41,754
Rym: I mean we did our Somewhat epic show on the burden of proof and that sort of thing.

268
00:15:41,794 --> 00:15:43,280
Rym: We talked about how to speak in public.

269
00:15:43,624 --> 00:15:54,608
Rym: We've talked briefly about how to argue but we're still gonna do a whole show on How to argue for truth and then a separate show on how to argue to win because they are very different Techniques very different.

270
00:15:54,668 --> 00:16:00,552
Scott: mostly I am concerned with the arguing for truth and Graham is concerned with the arguing for winning.

271
00:16:00,633 --> 00:16:08,120
Scott: see Scott here thinks he's a comedian but a Good example of the arguing to win versus my arguing for truth.

272
00:16:08,381 --> 00:16:17,274
Rym: It all comes down to the eternal battle between Calicles and Sophocles where Sophocles said There is truth and we must find it and Calicles said truth is whatever.

273
00:16:17,334 --> 00:16:22,328
Rym: I convinced all the stupid people around me And it's like Calicles is the bad guy and that D1.

274
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:25,256
Scott: yeah bad guys win the car old.

275
00:16:25,497 --> 00:16:26,720
Scott: shitty world bad guys win.

276
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,275
Scott: You know what shitty world bad guys win me is the truth.

277
00:16:30,637 --> 00:16:30,978
Scott: That's how.

278
00:16:31,018 --> 00:16:31,460
Scott: that's the truth.

279
00:16:32,421 --> 00:16:34,246
Rym: That might be the mean world fallacy.

280
00:16:34,929 --> 00:16:36,414
Scott: It could be mean world fallacy.

281
00:16:36,474 --> 00:16:40,573
Scott: Anyway, right now first We got to talk about I think arguments in general.

282
00:16:40,593 --> 00:16:51,475
Rym: Yeah, I'm gonna say one thing we're going to talk about a lot of this very generally because there's actually a whole field of study in terms of Argumentation and it involves a lot of Latin words.

283
00:16:51,496 --> 00:16:52,059
Scott: We don't know.

284
00:16:52,321 --> 00:17:00,000
Rym: Well more than that it involves a lot of very precise Terminology and it would take a whole show just to explain the bounds before we can even get into the good stuff.

285
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,294
Scott: Yeah, and most of that terminology we don't know even though we know the the thinking behind it.

286
00:17:04,796 --> 00:17:10,354
Rym: but in the end all Argumentation which is the fancy way of saying yelling at each other.

287
00:17:10,374 --> 00:17:11,520
Rym: Yep comes down.

288
00:17:11,929 --> 00:17:16,980
Scott: Oh, by the way This is a show you should pay attention to because it will help you on the Internet's where argumentation is common.

289
00:17:17,526 --> 00:17:25,000
Rym: And also once again You should go back and listen to our episode on the burden of proof because that is also critical very critical.

290
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:32,827
Rym: But all argumentation comes down to either arguing to convince or Arguing for collective truth.

291
00:17:33,529 --> 00:17:34,452
Rym: and aside from that.

292
00:17:34,993 --> 00:17:36,899
Rym: Are you inductively argue me?

293
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:43,584
Rym: argumenting arguing or are you deductively argumenting argumenting Dating.

294
00:17:43,804 --> 00:17:44,085
Scott: Yes.

295
00:17:44,246 --> 00:17:46,232
Scott: Are you deducting or inducting?

296
00:17:46,352 --> 00:17:48,720
Scott: deducting is like Sherlock Holmes?

297
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:54,206
Rym: Well, it's more like very simply All snakes are green.

298
00:17:54,627 --> 00:17:56,131
Rym: Let's say that that is my premise.

299
00:17:56,312 --> 00:17:58,117
Rym: I am assuming that all snakes are green.

300
00:17:59,280 --> 00:17:59,897
Rym: I see a snake.

301
00:18:00,762 --> 00:18:04,935
Rym: The snake therefore is green or there's a. I know that all snakes are green.

302
00:18:05,256 --> 00:18:06,359
Rym: There's a snake in that box.

303
00:18:07,384 --> 00:18:09,212
Rym: I know that that snake is green.

304
00:18:09,553 --> 00:18:17,660
Rym: now in deductive arguments If you accept the premise and the logic follows true, then you must accept the conclusion.

305
00:18:18,462 --> 00:18:19,805
Rym: Case closed end of that it is.

306
00:18:20,106 --> 00:18:22,813
Rym: it is a very precise and exact logic.

307
00:18:23,074 --> 00:18:27,588
Rym: this therefore this it's if this and This then that that sort of thing.

308
00:18:27,629 --> 00:18:27,810
Rym: Yep.

309
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:29,599
Scott: All A's are blue.

310
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,280
Scott: Here's an A that A is blue.

311
00:18:32,561 --> 00:18:37,900
Scott: Because if you believe that all A's are blue the first thing then you have to accept the second thing.

312
00:18:38,101 --> 00:18:39,044
Scott: You can't get around it.

313
00:18:39,205 --> 00:18:40,730
Scott: Otherwise, the first thing was wrong.

314
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:41,533
Scott: Go back to square one.

315
00:18:41,573 --> 00:18:50,380
Rym: Now this kind of argumentation is Difficult in one way because you have to be extremely precise in what you say and very careful about what you accept.

316
00:18:50,962 --> 00:18:57,725
Rym: But at the same time it's very easy because the conclusions are obvious absolutely obvious and undeniable.

317
00:18:58,147 --> 00:19:03,602
Rym: and furthermore a logical fallacy in regards to a deductive argument is Perfect.

318
00:19:03,883 --> 00:19:10,749
Rym: a logical fallacy in that case means that your argument is patently wrong Logically untrue.

319
00:19:10,769 --> 00:19:11,855
Rym: it is stupid.

320
00:19:11,876 --> 00:19:12,640
Rym: You're an idiot.

321
00:19:13,001 --> 00:19:20,904
Scott: Yeah, if you're making a deductive argument and you may you know submit a statement that is logically fallacious It is wrong.

322
00:19:20,924 --> 00:19:26,580
Scott: automatically just period up your girl up wrong and sorry go back to start wrong answer.

323
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,824
Scott: It doesn't matter what you said it was wrong.

324
00:19:28,884 --> 00:19:29,866
Scott: It was logical fallacy.

325
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:30,527
Scott: game over.

326
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:41,200
Rym: For example if I said all males are Human which is obviously not true, but let's say we accept that all male beings that could ever exist are human.

327
00:19:41,421 --> 00:19:42,830
Scott: Oh, here's a male dolphin.

328
00:19:44,038 --> 00:19:46,916
Rym: Ah All right, forget that you get the idea.

329
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:56,060
Rym: yeah All right But that's not what we're gonna talk about so much because that is no one ever argues deductively in the real world.

330
00:19:56,180 --> 00:20:03,240
Rym: They do in debate class debate class in high school debate club and that they kind of yeah like quiz ball is not debate.

331
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:04,223
Rym: It's literally.

332
00:20:04,585 --> 00:20:09,040
Rym: how fast can you talk and how fast can you flip through index cards and read things?

333
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,245
Rym: Someone else already wrote on.

334
00:20:10,285 --> 00:20:12,014
Scott: and how much did you research in advance?

335
00:20:12,275 --> 00:20:13,160
Rym: You don't do any research.

336
00:20:13,221 --> 00:20:14,200
Rym: It's already done for you.

337
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:20,200
Rym: If you're in the not I don't want to say professional but in like the people who go in like the national tournaments It's all already done.

338
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:25,233
Rym: You literally just flip through note cards Like they'll make an argument and you boil it down to.

339
00:20:25,273 --> 00:20:26,960
Rym: did they say Clinton good or Clinton bad?

340
00:20:27,301 --> 00:20:33,911
Rym: And if they said Clinton good you flip through to your Clinton folder until you find the Clinton good argument And you don't care what it is.

341
00:20:33,951 --> 00:20:35,319
Rym: You just read what's on that note card.

342
00:20:35,621 --> 00:20:37,266
Rym: No ignore what you're actually saying.

343
00:20:37,567 --> 00:20:41,220
Rym: you just read the note card and assume that that refuted whatever they said.

344
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:44,509
Rym: Yeah, it's so stupid, but I digress.

345
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:47,357
Scott: Yeah, I'm sure some debate club fans out there.

346
00:20:47,417 --> 00:20:47,558
Scott: good.

347
00:20:47,578 --> 00:20:48,842
Rym: Yeah, bring it You know what?

348
00:20:48,942 --> 00:20:49,625
Rym: I was debate.

349
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,612
Rym: I was varsity debate for like three years.

350
00:20:51,633 --> 00:20:53,781
Rym: All right, it is exactly like that All right.

351
00:20:53,801 --> 00:20:56,455
Scott: Well Rym you'll be defending that then I'm sure I can.

352
00:20:56,515 --> 00:20:57,380
Rym: I think I can handle that.

353
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,687
Scott: You'll be arguing about arguing.

354
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,396
Rym: I always argued the affirmative.

355
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:00,899
Scott: All right.

356
00:21:01,701 --> 00:21:04,368
Scott: So do you want to talk about the inductive arguments?

357
00:21:04,869 --> 00:21:09,160
Rym: inductive reasoning is pretty much what you do in your daily life.

358
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:10,725
Rym: It's not so much.

359
00:21:10,765 --> 00:21:14,337
Rym: There's a lot more kind of language involved or more reference.

360
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:15,400
Rym: I'm trying to be very generic here.

361
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:20,531
Rym: I don't want to bog you down with terms that you probably won't understand or they just won't be Interesting or that will be wrong about.

362
00:21:20,551 --> 00:21:21,336
Scott: I get yelled at.

363
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:29,059
Rym: Yeah I mean if you really want to know the details Just go find an article that describes the differences between deductive and inductive scientific method.

364
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,890
Rym: That'll probably explain it pretty succinctly.

365
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:37,380
Rym: Yep, but even in an inductive argument, you can still make a logical fallacy.

366
00:21:37,822 --> 00:21:44,525
Rym: The only difference is that a logical fallacy in those cases does not necessarily Always not follow.

367
00:21:44,545 --> 00:21:49,360
Rym: you might make a logical fallacy, but the truth at the end of the fallacy might be true.

368
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:56,980
Rym: Anyway, the difference is if your argument consists of nothing but logical fallacies, then you don't actually have an argument.

369
00:21:57,141 --> 00:22:07,640
Scott: Yeah, the best you could try to hope for is some sort of preponderance of evidence argument Mm-hmm in practical use of everydayness, which is what you care about the most, you know on the internet or with friends.

370
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:13,054
Scott: Logical fallacies are basically a way to help you win arguments against people.

371
00:22:13,114 --> 00:22:17,359
Scott: if you know the logical fallacies You know, which there there are a set number of them.

372
00:22:17,601 --> 00:22:22,880
Rym: Well, I mean there are a lot that people mention but there's a lot of classical ones that are clearly fallacy.

373
00:22:23,047 --> 00:22:33,743
Scott: Yes If you know them and you study them and you know what they are Then when you argue with someone you can just be like that was the logical fallacy of blah and you can just erase Everything they said.

374
00:22:33,823 --> 00:22:48,220
Scott: so in practical everyday use knowing logical fallacies helps you smack people down Because you because most people when they argue just you know Normally without you know thinking really hard about or studying make logical fallacies left and riding up and down.

375
00:22:48,623 --> 00:22:55,900
Scott: So if you know how to point them out You can just own people in arguments without even having to give one point of evidence in favor of your position.

376
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:07,197
Rym: In fact, there's an entire branch of rhetorical debate that effectively is dedicated to using logical fallacies like that to basically Confound idiots and then convince them that you're right.

377
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:15,339
Scott: Yep But on the other hand if you're so smart that you recognize this you have the ultimate defense where no logically fallacious Argument can stand in your way.

378
00:23:15,641 --> 00:23:22,220
Scott: But at the same time many correct arguments will fall before you because the people presenting them are so inept at arguing.

379
00:23:22,904 --> 00:23:28,752
Rym: now you can also take it one step further and You could if you're really clever and evil.

380
00:23:29,093 --> 00:23:34,592
Rym: you could use false Logical fallacies to confound your opponents and then win an argument.

381
00:23:34,612 --> 00:23:37,200
Rym: All right, especially if you just make up Latin words.

382
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:44,582
Rym: Making up Latin words is great You know, I I think this is the direction we should go in because we're definitely not awake enough to talk about the you know Nitty-gritty.

383
00:23:44,602 --> 00:23:46,328
Rym: Well this therefore there's blah blah blah blah blah.

384
00:23:46,348 --> 00:23:47,091
Rym: This is called this kind of.

385
00:23:47,572 --> 00:23:50,543
Rym: let's just go straight into the logical fallacies That matter the most.

386
00:23:50,723 --> 00:23:59,340
Scott: All right, the one that matters the most as far as I am concerned is my favorite one Which is postdoc ergo proctor hoc.

387
00:23:59,621 --> 00:24:03,496
Rym: I think that actually means that that does not follow or that that does follow or I don't know.

388
00:24:03,576 --> 00:24:11,866
Scott: I think it means Just because it comes after Doesn't mean it's basically Correlation does not equal causality, right?

389
00:24:11,906 --> 00:24:23,749
Scott: For example, let's say I have a statistic and the statistic says that People walking out of I'm trying to think of an example.

390
00:24:23,789 --> 00:24:24,232
Scott: It's funny.

391
00:24:24,473 --> 00:24:25,177
Scott: Can you think of anything?

392
00:24:25,198 --> 00:24:25,540
Scott: It's funny.

393
00:24:26,122 --> 00:24:28,634
Rym: I think we just go with a straight-up exam go at the straight-up exam.

394
00:24:28,654 --> 00:24:32,034
Rym: All right, so let's say I Can't come up with anything either guy.

395
00:24:32,074 --> 00:24:38,559
Rym: No, hold on You know, I guess we're just so good at arguing that we have trouble actually making a logical value.

396
00:24:40,891 --> 00:24:49,728
Rym: So let's say I have a statistic that says that in the past ten years The globe the average temperature of the earth has increased steadily and we can chart it clearly.

397
00:24:49,768 --> 00:24:58,010
Rym: It's increased Yep, and in that same span of ten years the number of pirates in international waters has decreased.

398
00:24:58,734 --> 00:25:07,564
Rym: now I could make the conclusion from this data that Pirates decreasing causes an increase in global temperature and this is obviously not true.

399
00:25:07,725 --> 00:25:08,467
Scott: No, it's not.

400
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,850
Scott: there are many things in the world.

401
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:12,056
Scott: They're coincidences all the time.

402
00:25:12,097 --> 00:25:13,120
Scott: They're you know, they're.

403
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:23,738
Scott: you know, Google is making more and more money every day and I'm getting a little bit more money every day and Google's getting a lot Here's that mean that Google.

404
00:25:23,758 --> 00:25:26,790
Scott: getting more money causes me getting more money or vice versa.

405
00:25:27,383 --> 00:25:35,050
Scott: No They just be two things in the world Happen to both be going up or two things happen to both be going down or one happens to go up when another goes down.

406
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,750
Rym: I mean, here's a real-world example.

407
00:25:37,313 --> 00:25:51,269
Rym: There's there is a perceived correlation between immunizations and autism which as Smart people know is caused mostly by the fact that children get their immunizations right about the time when autism symptoms kick in.

408
00:25:51,289 --> 00:25:56,930
Rym: and There's all this other evidence too that basically that correlation is completely fallacious.

409
00:25:57,393 --> 00:26:04,630
Rym: But yet people still make the argument which is a logical fallacy That they cause autism when in fact they do not and there's evidence that they do not.

410
00:26:05,012 --> 00:26:07,590
Scott: There are many things that they seem to go together.

411
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:16,388
Scott: You know one thing happens and another thing happens at the same time or one thing seems to happen a lot after Something else happens and it looks like it causes it.

412
00:26:17,051 --> 00:26:34,360
Scott: But unless you can actually show evidence that yes this caused it For example, you could show in like, you know a test tube, you know some DNA and then some vaccine and then the vaccine Modifying the DNA before and after to actually change it in a way That is to make that would make a person autistic.

413
00:26:34,601 --> 00:26:36,670
Scott: that would be a demonstration of causation.

414
00:26:37,373 --> 00:26:48,230
Scott: Other than that just because two things happen to coincide or you know Anything like that does not mean one thing caused the other and to say so without enough evidence is logically fallacious.

415
00:26:48,852 --> 00:26:55,890
Rym: So I think right along those lines perhaps my favorite because I'll admit that I use this as a rhetorical technique often ad hominins.

416
00:26:56,373 --> 00:26:57,138
Scott: No, no, no.

417
00:26:57,621 --> 00:26:58,890
Rym: the false dilemma.

418
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:01,839
Rym: Now the false dilemma is very simple.

419
00:27:02,642 --> 00:27:03,244
Rym: all I do.

420
00:27:03,324 --> 00:27:12,182
Rym: you do use the false dilemma quite a bit And you know what it works because as a rhetorical strategy, it is brilliance brilliant I say even though I shoot it down all the time.

421
00:27:12,684 --> 00:27:25,068
Rym: All you do is present what two or more options in an argument and Make the kind of beg to question assertion that those are in fact the only two options.

422
00:27:25,108 --> 00:27:29,090
Scott: for example You know Rym will make a statement and I'll say oh that statement, huh?

423
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:32,037
Scott: So either a or B, which is it?

424
00:27:32,278 --> 00:27:32,799
Scott: which is it?

425
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:51,409
Scott: and I'm totally ignoring the fact that there could be CDE and F. I'm acting as if a and B are the only possibilities in the whole world if you assume that what Rym just said is true and it sort of traps Rym because a is bad and B is bad also, but he can't get his mind out in out of that box and start thinking about CDE and F

426
00:27:52,092 --> 00:27:52,413
Rym: Certain.

427
00:27:52,734 --> 00:27:57,210
Rym: well one government in particular in the world in recent years has used this fallacy extensively.

428
00:27:57,913 --> 00:28:02,049
Rym: I believe you may know it as you're either with us or you're against us.

429
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:05,804
Rym: That is very much the false dichotomy.

430
00:28:06,065 --> 00:28:08,718
Scott: Yep False dichotomies are great.

431
00:28:08,919 --> 00:28:11,330
Rym: So you want to since you mentioned it you want to bring up the ad hominem?

432
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:17,210
Scott: All right ad hominem is is perhaps the the worst of all logical fallacies and the most used on the internet.

433
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:20,110
Scott: For example, let's say Rym set rims make up make a true statement.

434
00:28:21,144 --> 00:28:24,139
Rym: I am Incredibly intelligent and good-looking.

435
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,230
Scott: No, that's not a true statement.

436
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:32,550
Scott: You have to come up with something bad, but anyway, let's pretend the Rym said that Scott was incredibly intelligent and good-looking.

437
00:28:32,991 --> 00:28:34,777
Scott: So that's a true statement.

438
00:28:34,897 --> 00:28:38,990
Scott: But now let's say I go and I say well Rym you're wrong because you're ugly.

439
00:28:40,031 --> 00:28:41,415
Scott: That's basically what ad hominem is.

440
00:28:41,455 --> 00:28:46,630
Scott: you attack the person making the argument and you basically say well you're stupid.

441
00:28:46,912 --> 00:28:48,427
Scott: Therefore the thing you said is wrong.

442
00:28:48,467 --> 00:28:52,986
Scott: Listen You know, there are people in this world who are more educated than others.

443
00:28:53,006 --> 00:28:53,890
Scott: that that's just the truth.

444
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:57,005
Scott: You know, there are some people in the world who are smarter than others.

445
00:28:57,045 --> 00:29:02,810
Scott: That's the way it is, but Just because someone is dumb doesn't mean everything they say is automatically wrong.

446
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:10,433
Scott: I mean you could find the dumbest person in the world and they might say 1 plus 1 is 2. you can't say Well, you're dumb.

447
00:29:10,453 --> 00:29:14,510
Scott: that so 1 plus 1 isn't - no 1 plus 1 is - it's how it is.

448
00:29:15,012 --> 00:29:19,347
Scott: The person making the argument has nothing to do with the validity of the argument itself.

449
00:29:19,407 --> 00:29:36,910
Scott: like a lot of people You know, someone will be making a bunch of arguments and then someone will say well You're an ex-convict who killed a bunch of people and you know, that's a lot of the news channels will do that a lot, you know with some crazy person is making an argument, you know of some kind and you know Crazy people are usually wrong because they're crazy.

450
00:29:37,354 --> 00:29:38,950
Scott: It's they say a lot of crazy things.

451
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:53,710
Scott: But sometimes a crazy person says something right and people use ad hoc the logical fallacy of the ad hominem attack To sort of make it so that anyone if they're crazy or if they're evil or if they can they can make the person seem like a bad person.

452
00:29:54,231 --> 00:29:59,065
Scott: then it may give the impression that everything they say is wrong because they're a bad person.

453
00:29:59,085 --> 00:30:00,268
Scott: and that's just not true.

454
00:30:00,468 --> 00:30:12,290
Rym: right along those lines is the argument from fallacy which is the false conclusion that just because an Argument was itself technically a logical fallacy that therefore the conclusion is false.

455
00:30:13,532 --> 00:30:17,386
Rym: The example I'm just poking around Wikipedia to remind myself of which ones I want to talk about.

456
00:30:17,426 --> 00:30:20,149
Rym: but there's a good example here All cats are animals.

457
00:30:20,651 --> 00:30:21,694
Rym: Ginger is an animal.

458
00:30:21,995 --> 00:30:23,679
Rym: therefore ginger is a cat.

459
00:30:24,161 --> 00:30:26,367
Rym: now that does affirm the consequent.

460
00:30:26,427 --> 00:30:27,530
Rym: It is a logical fallacy.

461
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:31,590
Rym: But so the argument technically is an illogical argument.

462
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:35,230
Rym: But at the same time that does not prove that ginger is not a cat, right?

463
00:30:35,451 --> 00:30:38,490
Rym: It just proves that the person arguing doesn't know what they're talking about exactly.

464
00:30:38,731 --> 00:30:40,139
Scott: So the person makes that argument.

465
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,010
Scott: you don't have to believe that ginger is a cat.

466
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:43,596
Rym: Yeah, here's a good example.

467
00:30:43,817 --> 00:30:46,326
Rym: The sky is blue because I am God and I made it that way.

468
00:30:46,346 --> 00:30:50,153
Scott: Yeah, exactly It's like the sky might still be blue Just be.

469
00:30:50,193 --> 00:30:54,410
Scott: but the argument that they use to support the fact that the sky was blue was a bad argument.

470
00:30:54,753 --> 00:30:56,669
Scott: That doesn't mean the sky is suddenly not blue.

471
00:30:56,971 --> 00:31:03,491
Scott: I mean there are people around the world who argue for all sorts of different things and they use different evidence to support all those Arguments.

472
00:31:03,551 --> 00:31:12,190
Scott: but just because someone who's really bad at arguing is arguing for the right thing with bad evidence or falsehoods Doesn't mean that their conclusion is wrong.

473
00:31:12,231 --> 00:31:12,659
Scott: They might have.

474
00:31:13,006 --> 00:31:23,949
Scott: you know I might be trying to argue that one plus one is two and I might say well one is a half and one is a half and yeah, then you know, I might say something completely batshit and My argument might be bad.

475
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:29,850
Scott: But one plus one is still two either even though I just I'm not able to argue in favor of it because I suck.

476
00:31:30,791 --> 00:31:35,730
Rym: So, I know you've been waiting to bring it up so I figure I'll let you broke the no true Scotsman.

477
00:31:36,072 --> 00:31:47,725
Scott: Oh, no, no true Scotsman the game of goof Yes, the no true Scotsman argument is something you will find quite often and it's actually something related to.

478
00:31:47,786 --> 00:31:54,003
Scott: another pet peeve of mine is basically, someone will say some it really has to do a lot with semantics.

479
00:31:54,063 --> 00:32:19,350
Scott: the no true Scotsman argument is where someone will say Well, like I'll use Emily's mom was like, oh, well, they're not athletes and it's like well It's like people have these personal definitions of words or they assign their own value systems to the definition of a word in some way and it's like they don't want to apply a Certain label to something for whatever reason but it has nothing to do with with reality or truth.

480
00:32:19,511 --> 00:32:23,967
Scott: It's like oh, that's not a bagel because it's not at every if it's not an everything bagel.

481
00:32:24,007 --> 00:32:24,670
Scott: It's not a bagel.

482
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:29,750
Scott: Well, no a bagel by definition is a circular bread baked in a certain way with a certain dough.

483
00:32:29,911 --> 00:32:42,170
Rym: but at the same time if you're arguing the no true Scotsman is a Very easy way to get yourself out of a tricky situation If you can introduce it in such a way to where it's not clear right away that you're making the no true Scotsman.

484
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:55,464
Rym: Yes because if it's someone proves like if someone proves that I'm an Englishman and I don't want to be Portrayed as an Englishman for whatever reason then I could say ah But I do blah and no true Englishman would do blah therefore.

485
00:32:55,605 --> 00:32:56,950
Rym: I am NOT really an Englishman.

486
00:32:57,150 --> 00:33:02,130
Rym: Yes, despite the fact that you have just proven me to be an Englishman, but that is the unstated part.

487
00:33:02,431 --> 00:33:04,322
Rym: That's the part you say quietly to yourself.

488
00:33:04,523 --> 00:33:04,704
Rym: Yep.

489
00:33:04,764 --> 00:33:05,005
Scott: It's like.

490
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:16,763
Scott: on another podcast I listen to some guy was like science fiction means Spaceships and planets and that stuff and he I'm like, well, what about like, I don't know the Twilight Zone He's like in my personal definition.

491
00:33:17,024 --> 00:33:18,030
Scott: That's not science fiction.

492
00:33:18,672 --> 00:33:22,988
Scott: First if you think you have a personal definition of a word I gotta say this it's bullshit.

493
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,561
Rym: Well, no No, it isn't what you do.

494
00:33:24,581 --> 00:33:34,404
Rym: in that case it's just that that it's that fallacy often comes about unwittingly on both sides because The fallacy can arise if people are using different lexicons to argue.

495
00:33:34,524 --> 00:33:36,230
Rym: That's true, which happens often.

496
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:49,525
Rym: That's why probably the most important thing you can do when you're actually debating with someone and we'll talk about this whenever we do the argument show is to together Agree on the terms any time a word comes up and there's any disagreement.

497
00:33:49,545 --> 00:33:59,630
Rym: that would result in a no true Scotsman you kind of have a Subdebate where you both agree that the word means X and then you finish the debate as though that word means what you agreed upon.

498
00:33:59,715 --> 00:34:04,350
Rym: Yep Otherwise, you can't actually have a true argument because you're coming from two different positions.

499
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:18,440
Rym: if I think that all Scotsman or Willie and I argue as though any person who is Scottish is exactly like Willie from the Simpsons and Scott Argues from the perspective that Scottish people are Scottish we have a problem woman.

500
00:34:18,841 --> 00:34:19,884
Scott: Have you got any grease?

501
00:34:20,346 --> 00:34:20,626
Rym: Yes.

502
00:34:20,967 --> 00:34:21,469
Rym: Yes, I do.

503
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,134
Scott: Then grease me up woman.

504
00:34:23,435 --> 00:34:24,097
Rym: Okie dokie.

505
00:34:24,178 --> 00:34:24,940
Rym: All right.

506
00:34:25,482 --> 00:34:25,803
Rym: All right.

507
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:27,025
Rym: I got it.

508
00:34:27,306 --> 00:34:28,130
Rym: I got to do this one.

509
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:32,083
Rym: All right, partly because people use this phrase wrong.

510
00:34:32,164 --> 00:34:33,328
Scott: Are you gonna beg your question?

511
00:34:33,348 --> 00:34:34,010
Rym: I might.

512
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:35,437
Scott: I know you love begging the question.

513
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:49,969
Rym: if you ever want to infuriate me There is nothing you can do more perfectly more elegantly more Immediately than to use the phrase to beg the question to mean to raise the question.

514
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:53,830
Rym: That is not what that means and you're doing it wrong.

515
00:34:54,231 --> 00:35:10,208
Rym: Begging the question is a brilliant and subtle fallacy where you basically make an argument That assumes something But you just go right past proving the thing you're assuming and act as though it's already a postulate mmm-hmm.

516
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:19,750
Rym: and Basically what you've done is you've begged the question For example, I say the world is flat because God made it that way.

517
00:35:20,572 --> 00:35:23,180
Rym: Well now I've begged a whole bunch of questions.

518
00:35:23,562 --> 00:35:24,344
Rym: So there's a God.

519
00:35:24,444 --> 00:35:26,190
Rym: so we made the world so we made it flat.

520
00:35:26,378 --> 00:35:32,718
Scott: Yeah It's you make a statement and you act like the statement has already been proven like and you didn't you know back it up at all.

521
00:35:32,738 --> 00:35:40,970
Scott: and Now the people are gonna ask a whole bunch of questions like well How wait a minute go back a minute that thing you you just said something to support another argument.

522
00:35:41,251 --> 00:35:43,920
Scott: But that's something you said isn't quite right.

523
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,690
Scott: I got a bunch of questions to ask about it's kind of it's circular logic.

524
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:48,355
Rym: It's like you use your can.

525
00:35:48,376 --> 00:35:51,546
Rym: your conclusion implicitly proves the precedent.

526
00:35:51,747 --> 00:35:51,967
Scott: Yep.

527
00:35:52,349 --> 00:35:54,034
Scott: Yep Alright, you want me to do one?

528
00:35:54,335 --> 00:35:55,118
Rym: I think you should do one.

529
00:35:55,499 --> 00:36:01,117
Scott: Alright, this is the fallacy of many questions Of the loaded question.

530
00:36:01,197 --> 00:36:03,666
Scott: in Latin the Plurium interrogate.

531
00:36:03,706 --> 00:36:04,770
Rym: you're looking at Wikipedia.

532
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:05,573
Scott: Yes, I am.

533
00:36:05,593 --> 00:36:11,673
Scott: Okay, but you know, you know kids will often pick on each other and they'll say something like hey Have you?

534
00:36:11,874 --> 00:36:13,822
Scott: uh, have you told your parents that you're stupid?

535
00:36:14,465 --> 00:36:15,690
Rym: When did you stop beating your wife?

536
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:17,942
Scott: Yeah, when'd you stop beating your wife did?

537
00:36:17,983 --> 00:36:19,150
Rym: how long have you been a communist?

538
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:20,212
Scott: Exactly.

539
00:36:20,795 --> 00:36:22,383
Scott: It's how long have you been a communist?

540
00:36:22,423 --> 00:36:23,770
Scott: you you in your statement?

541
00:36:24,151 --> 00:36:31,495
Scott: You you basically ask a question where no answer to the question directly Will be true.

542
00:36:31,535 --> 00:36:36,410
Scott: because like if you ask someone how long have you been a communist you're making the assumption that they're a communist.

543
00:36:36,552 --> 00:36:41,530
Scott: And if they're not a communist How do you can't say wait your question is wrong.

544
00:36:41,911 --> 00:36:51,830
Scott: this is basically asking a question in which the question carries a false assumption and It's a really good trick because people are like what the fuck and it's you know, what do you say to that?

545
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:58,030
Scott: I mean, you know, it's like even if someone comes up to you and says hey Have you have you told your parents that you know?

546
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:02,490
Scott: You stole a million dollars from the bank and it'd be like I didn't steal a million dollars in the bank.

547
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:04,555
Scott: That's sort of a weak comeback to that.

548
00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:06,741
Scott: Are you know convincingly to other people?

549
00:37:06,801 --> 00:37:08,847
Scott: So it's it.

550
00:37:09,187 --> 00:37:10,050
Scott: it's very false.

551
00:37:10,572 --> 00:37:20,496
Scott: But if you're arguing with people and you use this technique It's very difficult for them to say something that makes them look powerful, you know It really puts you on top of the game.

552
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:24,270
Rym: now one particular branch of five fallacies.

553
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:32,209
Rym: I'll just call them the appeals in general and This is an argument that you don't make really to the person you're arguing with ever.

554
00:37:32,932 --> 00:37:38,930
Rym: Wow, it seems like every time I bring up a fallacy I end up describing it as here's how to use this fallacy in an argument.

555
00:37:39,211 --> 00:37:44,550
Rym: Yeah, but this is a the kind of thing where you're not even you don't even care who you're arguing with.

556
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:53,750
Rym: this is a fallacy where you appeal to the audience and Furthermore you appeal to something that has nothing to do with the argument with the audience like an appeal to fear.

557
00:37:54,291 --> 00:38:02,416
Rym: You appeal to the fear of the audience like if we listen to him then Nazis are gonna come and kill you all That.

558
00:38:02,778 --> 00:38:06,517
Rym: if not, unless you're in World War two era Germany is a logical fallacy.

559
00:38:06,537 --> 00:38:08,385
Rym: you were appealing to the fear of the audience.

560
00:38:08,606 --> 00:38:12,722
Rym: their fear of Nazis Have nothing to do with the argument at hand.

561
00:38:12,862 --> 00:38:27,310
Scott: You're basically scaring people into Agreeing with what you say no matter what your bait you're saying at all, you know, like I could say All right I say X and Rym says why and if you believe why you're all gonna die tomorrow.

562
00:38:27,551 --> 00:38:30,909
Scott: if you believe X will all live in paradise, which one do you believe?

563
00:38:30,929 --> 00:38:37,210
Scott: and The the ifs the if statements that I just presented were both had absolutely no evidence to support them whatsoever.

564
00:38:37,693 --> 00:38:45,630
Scott: But by making them I was able to basically Convince weak-minded people into believing my thing no matter what a is and no matter what X is.

565
00:38:46,434 --> 00:38:47,609
Scott: That that's what he's talking about.

566
00:38:48,003 --> 00:38:59,570
Rym: Yeah and I also got to bring this one up because it's also a very useful one and it's one that we've actually brought up a lot because I I've been known to use it occasionally in a rhetorical debate, but the straw man

567
00:39:00,072 --> 00:39:01,700
Scott: Oh the strong of the famous straw man.

568
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:05,457
Scott: many people they talk about the straw man But they don't really know what the straw man is.

569
00:39:05,498 --> 00:39:07,909
Rym: They think Wizard of Oz nothing burns like an effigy.

570
00:39:08,674 --> 00:39:13,507
Rym: Nothing quite burns like the effigy basically, so Scott's arguing some point.

571
00:39:13,909 --> 00:39:15,838
Rym: now What I'm doing.

572
00:39:15,858 --> 00:39:16,963
Scott: Zelda 1 is the greatest.

573
00:39:17,144 --> 00:39:21,068
Rym: the analogy that I'll do that I'll make here is that Scott is standing there arguing.

574
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:30,983
Rym: I distract the audience by making a straw man a scarecrow that looks like Scott and Then I set it on fire and the audience says wow.

575
00:39:31,023 --> 00:39:32,350
Rym: He just burned that scarecrow.

576
00:39:32,632 --> 00:39:34,123
Rym: Meanwhile, the real Scott is standing there.

577
00:39:34,143 --> 00:39:34,929
Rym: No one's listening to him.

578
00:39:35,793 --> 00:39:59,090
Rym: The straw man is when you take the other person's argument and Reframe it or rephrase it in such a way that it sounds so much worse than it was or even better if you change it entirely and you make it disappear as though your enemy is arguing something that they're not really arguing and Furthermore you make that thing that you have made it sound like they're arguing be patently false and easily disproven.

579
00:39:59,231 --> 00:40:02,810
Scott: For example Rym might say so pick Rym pick a video game.

580
00:40:03,111 --> 00:40:06,210
Rym: Alright Silver Surfer is the best video game ever right?

581
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:07,674
Scott: So I say so.

582
00:40:07,714 --> 00:40:11,445
Scott: you're saying that Zelda 1 is a terrible god-awful game.

583
00:40:11,666 --> 00:40:12,930
Scott: Well, you must be a terrible person.

584
00:40:13,854 --> 00:40:21,150
Scott: But I said right he didn't say anything about Zelda But I basically put words in his mouth to make it, you know.

585
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:29,459
Scott: And I basically, you know made this scarecrow that looks like Rym and I put my hand in the back of it Like a little puppeteer, you know or a wedding marionette.

586
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:34,857
Scott: and I made that scarecrow say Zelda is terrible And then I set it on fire like it.

587
00:40:34,918 --> 00:40:37,447
Scott: Look Rym said Zelda's terrible and everyone agrees with me.

588
00:40:37,688 --> 00:40:39,878
Scott: Yeah Get him Zelda's great.

589
00:40:39,918 --> 00:40:47,630
Scott: Yeah, even though Rym didn't say Zelda was terrible I just make it look like Rym said something really bad that everyone will disagree with when he didn't say anything of the sort.

590
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:57,448
Rym: It's basically a way to make your opponent look bad And as a result, you can then use the leverage you've gained from making them look bad to make everything else They say look just as bad.

591
00:40:57,771 --> 00:41:08,050
Rym: Yep, and also if they make a real solid argument by reframing the argument carefully You can introduce a way of defeating the argument that wasn't there in what they originally said.

592
00:41:08,391 --> 00:41:09,998
Scott: Now there's a problem with the straw man.

593
00:41:10,018 --> 00:41:12,650
Scott: that I run into quite often is if you're making an argument.

594
00:41:13,071 --> 00:41:18,110
Scott: Sometimes you can straw man yourself by accident because you'll have an idea in your mind.

595
00:41:18,491 --> 00:41:29,646
Scott: It usually happens more the less eloquent you are and you have an idea in your mind of what you arguing But you're unable to express that idea or maybe you're just unable to communicate that idea to ever.

596
00:41:29,686 --> 00:41:36,984
Scott: you trying to communicate it to you And the idea they get in their head from your words is Different from the idea that you're actually trying to get across.

597
00:41:37,105 --> 00:41:38,190
Scott: and thus the argue.

598
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:44,910
Scott: You'll basically build a straw man by accident and then they'll the person you're trying to convince starts beating up the straw man.

599
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:46,777
Scott: You're like I'm over here guys.

600
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:48,042
Scott: It's not what I was trying to say.

601
00:41:48,143 --> 00:41:49,990
Scott: Maybe I should call that man by accident.

602
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:51,867
Rym: Maybe we should call that the funeral pyre.

603
00:41:53,756 --> 00:41:57,329
Rym: I build a funeral pyre around myself and then I just wait for my opponent to light it.

604
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:59,480
Rym: Yes, I'm like that, you know, I know even better.

605
00:41:59,501 --> 00:42:01,230
Rym: We'll call it the gas can on the head fallacy.

606
00:42:02,833 --> 00:42:06,830
Rym: All right, let's argue but I'm gonna stand here with this gas can and I know you've got a match.

607
00:42:09,472 --> 00:42:14,790
Scott: I got one that people use quite often and is really pissing me off every day and people don't seem to stop using it.

608
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:15,152
Scott: All right.

609
00:42:15,172 --> 00:42:17,510
Scott: So hey Rym a is true.

610
00:42:17,911 --> 00:42:19,095
Scott: You know why is true?

611
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:23,990
Scott: because all my friends say so and because everyone else says so you know what?

612
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:34,582
Scott: if everyone in the whole world Except for me says that one plus one is three and I say that one plus one is two I'm right and everyone else in the world is wrong.

613
00:42:34,622 --> 00:42:34,823
Scott: Now.

614
00:42:35,244 --> 00:42:42,468
Scott: This is a tricky one because Conspiracy theory type people will often be like yeah, the whole world is wrong.

615
00:42:42,528 --> 00:42:43,090
Scott: It's a huge concern.

616
00:42:43,371 --> 00:42:46,450
Scott: It's not common for the whole world to be wrong.

617
00:42:46,891 --> 00:42:52,210
Rym: When anytime, you know, you see some crazy guy I was gonna remember, you know, how do you know that?

618
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:53,012
Rym: You're not that guy.

619
00:42:53,113 --> 00:42:58,310
Rym: anytime you think that everyone else is crazy, but you the odds are against you.

620
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:07,030
Scott: Yeah, I mean crazy people generally seem to think that you know They're right and everyone else in the whole world has got it wrong about achievements whatever.

621
00:43:07,712 --> 00:43:12,707
Scott: But it's not just because many crazy people are like that and they are crazy.

622
00:43:12,747 --> 00:43:15,970
Scott: Don't get yourself wrong Doesn't mean it's necessarily true.

623
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:22,190
Scott: I mean like Albert Einstein came up with the theory of relativity It was like him and a few people in the whole rest of the world had it wrong.

624
00:43:22,431 --> 00:43:26,847
Scott: And now the whole rest of the world realized and now we have it right err than we did before.

625
00:43:27,048 --> 00:43:27,489
Scott: you know, right?

626
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:29,756
Scott: Right err more correct.

627
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:42,210
Scott: So just because a large number of P It's the argument ad populum populace many people, you know a population of people It just because a lot of people agree on something doesn't make it true.

628
00:43:42,532 --> 00:43:47,315
Scott: a lot of people agree on a lot of things and They're very wrong.

629
00:43:47,335 --> 00:43:50,910
Scott: a lot of people, you know, a lot of people in this world believe all sorts of crazy stuff.

630
00:43:51,351 --> 00:43:57,970
Scott: I mean people are believing in like fake medicine and all sorts of bad shit, you know psychic powers and it's all false.

631
00:43:58,351 --> 00:44:02,463
Scott: just because a lot just because more people agree on something doesn't make it more true.

632
00:44:02,884 --> 00:44:11,334
Scott: if everyone in the whole world said that you know Nintendo is spelled QX JBF It's still fell.

633
00:44:11,414 --> 00:44:13,502
Scott: it's still spelled nint endo.

634
00:44:14,004 --> 00:44:21,330
Rym: the real point here is pretty simple Just any time someone is trying to argue with you don't you don't need to memorize the stupid names of fallacies.

635
00:44:21,431 --> 00:44:27,221
Rym: You don't need to know like well, that's the fallacy of this and that's an informal fallacy And that's a formal fallacy and that it out of that.

636
00:44:27,904 --> 00:44:38,775
Rym: All you need to do is In your head whenever someone's speaking boil down what they're saying to what logical argument They're actually making if they're making a logical argument at all.

637
00:44:39,236 --> 00:44:46,010
Rym: And at that point if you can do that Very often if they're making a bad argument, it will become readily apparent.

638
00:44:46,372 --> 00:44:49,726
Rym: And if you can point that out, you've pretty much won the day.

639
00:44:49,746 --> 00:44:53,035
Scott: Mm-hmm Oh and you know That's pretty much what it comes down to.

640
00:44:53,075 --> 00:44:57,070
Scott: you're arguing with people and the way people argue on the internet these days is just logical.

641
00:44:57,211 --> 00:44:58,316
Scott: Fallacies left and right.

642
00:44:58,698 --> 00:45:02,658
Scott: so if you just learn to notice them You could just win any are you?

643
00:45:02,698 --> 00:45:05,250
Scott: just shut people down left and right shut down shut down shut down.

644
00:45:05,551 --> 00:45:09,470
Scott: The thing is it takes quite a bit of thinking and quite a bit of learning and quite a bit of practice.

645
00:45:09,732 --> 00:45:12,530
Rym: That's where the so-called name fallacies kind of come anyone.

646
00:45:12,711 --> 00:45:16,249
Scott: Yeah, if anyone comes along and is like hey Scott, you don't argue that way.

647
00:45:16,471 --> 00:45:18,330
Scott: Yeah, cuz I you know not trying to do it all the time.

648
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:18,972
Scott: What do you want from me?

649
00:45:19,895 --> 00:45:23,726
Rym: and I often use the opposite and I use logical fallacies to my own ends.

650
00:45:23,826 --> 00:45:24,147
Scott: Yes.

651
00:45:24,247 --> 00:45:26,092
Scott: Yes you do All right.

652
00:45:26,112 --> 00:45:27,478
Scott: We have anything else to say about this now.

653
00:45:27,498 --> 00:45:28,080
Rym: I'm going to bed.
