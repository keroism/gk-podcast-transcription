1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,410
Rym: It's Thursday, May 1st.

2
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:10,732
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:12,540
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:17,460
Rym: And tonight, Geeknight Thursdays is changing it up and we bring you the lounge.

5
00:00:18,303 --> 00:00:19,417
Rym: Or whatever we're going to call it.

6
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:26,908
Rym: Let's do this.

7
00:00:30,911 --> 00:00:32,909
Rym: Tonight might be a little weird.

8
00:00:33,771 --> 00:00:36,750
Scott: A little, it's going to be half weird, half cop out.

9
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:37,624
Rym: Half assed.

10
00:00:40,037 --> 00:00:41,350
Scott: I didn't even see that one coming, that was good.

11
00:00:41,712 --> 00:00:42,268
Rym: I'm proud of that.

12
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:48,490
Rym: You see, don't get us wrong, don't read into this a lot, but we're not getting tired of Geeknights.

13
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:49,610
Rym: Geeknights isn't changing.

14
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:53,369
Rym: The Geeknights you know and love is going to be the same as you've always known and loved it.

15
00:00:53,632 --> 00:00:54,748
Scott: Actually, this is the last Geeknights.

16
00:00:56,452 --> 00:00:58,330
Rym: I'm going to start writing a wow blog.

17
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:01,130
Rym: I think I should really focus on my wow blog.

18
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,048
Rym: I think that's where my life is going right now.

19
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:11,610
Rym: You know, the fact that Dave had to point out like four days after they'd start, like four shows after the joke.

20
00:01:11,891 --> 00:01:13,709
Rym: Like, you know, it was a joke.

21
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:15,869
Scott: We're still podcasting.

22
00:01:16,091 --> 00:01:19,229
Scott: Didn't you notice that there were other episodes there after the watch?

23
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:23,232
Rym: Because you know, like 50 of their listeners were probably just like, "What?

24
00:01:23,273 --> 00:01:23,695
Rym: It's over.

25
00:01:24,621 --> 00:01:26,010
Rym: Unsubscribed in the feed.

26
00:01:26,351 --> 00:01:28,569
Rym: Took the bookmark out of their bookmarks.

27
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,724
Rym: Has no idea that Dave Riley is still podcasting out

28
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:32,728
Rym: there.".

29
00:01:33,214 --> 00:01:33,689
Scott: And Joel White.

30
00:01:34,972 --> 00:01:36,970
Rym: It's weird how, it's kind of like how Anime World Order.

31
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:37,990
Rym: There's three people.

32
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:43,449
Rym: There's Daryl, Clarissa, and Gerald, but I always just kind of mention Daryl Surratt and leave it at that.

33
00:01:44,074 --> 00:01:45,650
Rym: I kind of only mention Dave Riley.

34
00:01:45,932 --> 00:01:47,404
Rym: And I say his whole name too.

35
00:01:47,444 --> 00:01:48,069
Rym: What's up with that?

36
00:01:48,631 --> 00:01:49,808
Scott: Because there's a lot of Daves.

37
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,450
Scott: If you just say Dave, it's like which one?

38
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,710
Rym: Just Dave Riley kind of rolls off the tongue.

39
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:58,690
Scott: It's not like Scott where there's only one person named Scott, so you don't have to say any last name.

40
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,950
Rym: Yes, there's only one person named Scott.

41
00:02:01,152 --> 00:02:01,429
Scott: That's right.

42
00:02:02,171 --> 00:02:02,810
Rym: Scott Johnson.

43
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,849
Rym: Because I do recall back at RIT.

44
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:07,469
Scott: Now his name is Scott Johnson.

45
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:08,478
Scott: You see, my name is Scott.

46
00:02:08,882 --> 00:02:09,770
Scott: His name is Scott Johnson.

47
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:12,570
Rym: Well, I remember there were a bunch of ways we tried to deal with that problem.

48
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,406
Rym: First, we called you Scott Prime.

49
00:02:14,831 --> 00:02:15,829
Scott: That didn't last very long.

50
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,465
Rym: Yeah, but I remember you tried to spin it like, "Yeah, but it's like Optimus

51
00:02:19,505 --> 00:02:19,849
Rym: Prime.".

52
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,330
Scott: Right, because if I'm Prime, that's like one.

53
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:30,490
Rym: So the other one had to be like Scott Squared, which is like-- No, Prime is the alternate, the one that came after.

54
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,904
Rym: That means that Scott Johnson was the one who came before, and you're just a weeper.

55
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,790
Scott: So before Optimus Prime, that was just Optimus?

56
00:02:37,092 --> 00:02:37,368
Rym: Yes.

57
00:02:37,893 --> 00:02:38,710
Scott: Where was Optimus?

58
00:02:39,051 --> 00:02:40,370
Rym: Doing geometry somewhere.

59
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:41,098
Scott: No.

60
00:02:42,374 --> 00:02:43,430
Scott: It was Optimus Prime.

61
00:02:43,471 --> 00:02:44,209
Rym: You know where he wasn't?

62
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,748
Rym: Teaching Starscream how to shoot.

63
00:02:47,976 --> 00:02:50,009
Rym: Or, you know, I could say that for any Decepticon.

64
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,129
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

65
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,790
Scott: You can't aim for shit, Shockwave.

66
00:02:54,611 --> 00:02:57,370
Rym: I think Shockwave was the worst of them, but Starscream was no good.

67
00:02:57,895 --> 00:02:58,830
Rym: He never hit anything.

68
00:02:59,132 --> 00:02:59,176
Scott: No.

69
00:03:00,172 --> 00:03:00,304
Rym: Anyway.

70
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,630
Scott: And he didn't do enough damage.

71
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:06,270
Rym: If you couldn't tell, we're changing up the Thursday format a little bit here.

72
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:15,550
Scott: Yeah, Thursday was always hard to come up with episodes, and in the calendar right now, we sort of filled it in, but all the episodes are like cornball.

73
00:03:16,052 --> 00:03:19,569
Scott: It was sort of like stupid versus arguments, like this or that.

74
00:03:19,931 --> 00:03:21,170
Rym: Or what if I was a spaceship?

75
00:03:21,894 --> 00:03:22,950
Scott: What if I was a spaceship?

76
00:03:24,296 --> 00:03:26,070
Rym: I don't know why I put it in that calendar.

77
00:03:27,192 --> 00:03:29,288
Rym: Every week I'd look at it and go, "What the fuck is

78
00:03:29,328 --> 00:03:29,510
Rym: that?".

79
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:33,130
Rym: And I'd push it back like a month, and then a month would go by and I'd see it there again.

80
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,825
Rym: I'd be like, "Why did I even put that in the

81
00:03:34,846 --> 00:03:35,290
Rym: calendar?".

82
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:41,990
Scott: Yeah, the Thursday calendar is pretty much filled up with who would win in a fight episodes and what if episodes.

83
00:03:42,451 --> 00:03:47,490
Scott: And while those could be occasionally fun, Thursday is not going to become what if day.

84
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:51,310
Rym: Plus, more to the point, there's kind of two driving factors here.

85
00:03:51,652 --> 00:03:54,250
Rym: One, we've been doing gig nights for a long time now.

86
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,664
Rym: We're pushing some 500 episodes.

87
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:58,421
Scott: We started in '05.

88
00:03:59,524 --> 00:03:59,650
Scott: It's '08.

89
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,829
Rym: We've got like 500 episodes now.

90
00:04:03,132 --> 00:04:03,548
Rym: It's crazy.

91
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:10,050
Rym: And on one hand, I'm not getting tired of it, but I feel like we should switch it up a little bit.

92
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:15,010
Rym: Like, it always, I don't know, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday are like these solid shows where it's topical all the way through.

93
00:04:15,572 --> 00:04:19,910
Rym: And Thursday, it's kind of like the catch-all, you know, for various rents and tomfoolery and whatever.

94
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:28,349
Rym: But I feel like if we made the format more conducive to more laid-back talk, we'd probably end up covering a lot more interesting things.

95
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:37,889
Scott: Well, I think really what we need to do is, on the one hand, we need sort of less structure on the Thursday, to separate it from the other days.

96
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:44,570
Scott: But on the other hand, we need a little bit more structure to enhance the creativity of what the hell are we going to talk about.

97
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:52,270
Scott: Because, you know, when you have, we always talk about this, but when you have limitations, that's when you can be more creative.

98
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:55,210
Scott: When it's just anything goes, it's very difficult.

99
00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:03,630
Scott: So I think by narrowing the thought process for Thursday, we can come up with better ideas of what to do the show on.

100
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:07,730
Rym: Well, part of it, too, is that we're still going to do Thursday shows, same as always.

101
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:12,369
Rym: I think it's just more that the format for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday is really coalesced.

102
00:05:13,151 --> 00:05:16,930
Rym: Like, we used to debate about whether or not the news should be germane to the topic.

103
00:05:17,431 --> 00:05:23,110
Rym: We had long debates about whether or not, like, on a Wednesday, we would always only talk about anime news.

104
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:27,870
Rym: And we even, for a while, considered only anime, manga, or comic-related things of the day.

105
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:31,770
Rym: And we still aren't, I mean, now it seems like we keep the news topical.

106
00:05:32,213 --> 00:05:44,009
Rym: Things of the day are only topical if there's something great, but I feel like we kind of tried to sneak in the cross-pollination a little bit, because, you know, our whole shtick is pan-geekism and how you can always get into another geekery.

107
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:54,950
Scott: Yeah, but I think generally what we try to do is we lean towards using a relevant news and thing of the day, but if we can't find one, just fuck it and just do whatever.

108
00:05:55,290 --> 00:06:14,770
Rym: Our long-term goal is I feel like if we alter the format of all the different shows a little bit based on the topic, so, like, if we kind of change Wednesdays into, instead of, you know, the rigid format of "open-y bit" where we talk about nothing, "news" where we, like, read Anime News Network.

109
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,150
Scott: People know the format of the show.

110
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,740
Rym: Yeah, but, like, it's so rigid.

111
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,030
Rym: Like, we do this, and we do the news, thing of the day, and then the main bit.

112
00:06:21,332 --> 00:06:22,450
Rym: Then we kind of trail off.

113
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:41,010
Scott: I think what we need to do is we need to tweak the format of each day such that it's still GeekNights, but, you know, we change the Wednesday format to be more conducive to Anime, Manga, Comic Talk, and we can tweak the format of Tuesday so that maybe all the days won't have the same format.

114
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:45,210
Scott: They will just have formats that are accustomed to the topic at hand.

115
00:06:45,591 --> 00:06:46,669
Rym: Now, I mean, we started this.

116
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:53,949
Rym: Scott's box was kind of an experiment along those lines because the original concept for GeekNights, I mean, we're talking many years ago.

117
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,609
Scott: Was pillow talk with Rym and Scott?

118
00:06:55,791 --> 00:07:00,930
Rym: Well, after that, after that initial, wow, yeah.

119
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:01,812
Rym: You know what?

120
00:07:01,853 --> 00:07:08,610
Rym: If we'd had money, we probably would have started doing a radio show in, like, 2002.

121
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:12,030
Rym: It would have been about January 2002.

122
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,448
Rym: We would have started podcasting.

123
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:14,226
Scott: Something like that.

124
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,929
Rym: But, no, luckily for all of you, we didn't have any money.

125
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:23,450
Scott: We would have been the first podcasters before podcasting existed, before everyone had iPods.

126
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,409
Rym: We would have just had this radio show.

127
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:28,450
Scott: We would have just had this blog, basically, running on, like, Perl.

128
00:07:28,914 --> 00:07:30,124
Scott: that was just links to MP3s.

129
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:37,330
Scott: We would have hosted-- And RIT's bandwidth would have been like, hey, and they would have shut us down, and they wouldn't have been able to afford any other bandwidth.

130
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:42,570
Rym: Actually, knowing RIT, Al Biles or someone probably would have, like, gotten us official RIT business.

131
00:07:42,993 --> 00:07:43,509
Scott: Yeah, maybe.

132
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:46,810
Rym: But in return, we would have had to probably give up the show when we graduated.

133
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:47,608
Scott: Something like that.

134
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:58,705
Rym: But the original concept after pillow talk with Rym and Scott was that we would have a show that's like a late show, and we'd have, like, 15 different bits.

135
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:00,970
Rym: Like, there's the opening bit.

136
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:01,969
Rym: There's the news bit.

137
00:08:02,252 --> 00:08:04,150
Rym: There's the, like, review bit.

138
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,189
Rym: There's the topical, like, op-ed bit.

139
00:08:06,531 --> 00:08:08,890
Rym: There's the bring a guest in for five minutes bit.

140
00:08:09,351 --> 00:08:14,050
Rym: And every show would be, like, a different collection of these bits, depending on what we had put together.

141
00:08:14,651 --> 00:08:22,229
Rym: A Monday show might have been the opening bit, and then we do the science news bit, and then we do, like, the things of the day, which is like this aside.

142
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:31,149
Rym: Like, we break in and do the things of the day, and then we come back with the science minute that we do every Monday, and then we do, like, the main show, and then we end with the reader feedback thing.

143
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:31,694
Scott: Yep.

144
00:08:32,452 --> 00:08:43,729
Rym: That would have been great, and we probably would have done that if GeekNights was one night a week, because changing up like that would have required a lot of work, and there's no way we could have pulled that off early on.

145
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:54,969
Scott: Yeah, we would have had to come up with all those different bits, and then each and every episode, we would have had to select which bits we were going to do and figure out exactly what we were going to do in them, and then ordered them and figure out how much long they were going to take.

146
00:08:55,594 --> 00:08:56,549
Rym: Now, we could have done that.

147
00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:06,150
Rym: What really stopped us was the fact that way back then, early on, it took a long time to do post-production, and it took us a long time to do pre-production for what little we were doing.

148
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:11,164
Rym: So we knew that that sort of complex format was way out of our league, and we didn't even try it.

149
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:29,788
Rym: But now, post-production, it takes me longer to type the post that you see in our WordPress than it does to edit, upload -- well, maybe not upload, because Libsyn's slow -- but to edit, to put together, to filter, to process, to make the MP3, to make the ID3 and all that.

150
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,330
Rym: It's faster to do all that than it is to type the WordPress.

151
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,529
Rym: GeekNights does not take us very long to do.

152
00:09:34,772 --> 00:09:35,170
Rym: All right.

153
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:40,730
Rym: But at the same time, I don't know if I want to go back to the days of GeekNights taking three hours every night.

154
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,470
Scott: So here's what I'm thinking.

155
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:49,909
Scott: I'm thinking that we should have sort of different types of Thursdays, and then we could cycle through them.

156
00:09:50,571 --> 00:09:59,090
Scott: That way, each individual Thursday episode, we can sort of focus and come up with something to do the show on more easily, but it won't be the same thing every week.

157
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:06,118
Scott: So we could do, like, maybe talk to someone on Skype Thursdays, or what else can we do?

158
00:10:07,572 --> 00:10:08,549
Scott: We had these ideas before.

159
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:08,813
Rym: That's it.

160
00:10:08,854 --> 00:10:09,727
Rym: We'll just Skype people in.

161
00:10:10,373 --> 00:10:13,656
Rym: But we'll do the listener feedback thing, or we'll do the --.

162
00:10:14,038 --> 00:10:23,490
Rym: we had an episode a long time ago, something about, you know, on the way to the forum, something funny happened on the way to the forum, and that actually was a really popular episode.

163
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:26,990
Scott: So, like, that could be a bit where we -- It was popular among people in the forum.

164
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:29,190
Scott: I don't know how much people outside the forum.

165
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:32,250
Rym: That episode was pretty well -- kind of like those Questions episodes.

166
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:36,310
Rym: They were way downloaded, more so than other episodes at the same kind of era.

167
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:36,751
Rym: Yeah.

168
00:10:36,771 --> 00:10:45,850
Scott: My only hesitation with that kind of episode is that I really want to make sure that all the episodes of GeekNights, like, anyone coming in can get it.

169
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:49,010
Scott: I don't want to be, you know, sort of, like, inside baseball at all.

170
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:51,710
Rym: Oh, no, but it's very trivial to make that not inside baseball.

171
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,550
Rym: You just -- you go through the virtual world.

172
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:58,430
Rym: We're going to try it in the second half of the show again, and I think you'll see it'll work pretty well, even if you don't even know what GeekNights is.

173
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,710
Rym: But the long-term goal is that.

174
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:05,047
Rym: But I think the short-term goal is all we're going to do to have the most impact and to learn the most.

175
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:13,310
Rym: the quickest is to kind of, you know -- GeekNights Mondays will be science and technology, and GeekNights Tuesdays will be gaming, and Wednesdays will be anime, manga, comics.

176
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:13,653
Rym: People know.

177
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:15,150
Scott: Why are you repeating all this stuff?

178
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,020
Rym: Because that's what you do.

179
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:23,110
Rym: But GeekNights Thursdays are not going to be GeekNights Thursdays, blah, you know, because it's kind of this nothing thing.

180
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:26,030
Rym: It's going to be GeekNights Thursdays or GeekNights The Lounge.

181
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,510
Rym: I think that's going to be the title.

182
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:28,930
Scott: You really like that lounge idea.

183
00:11:29,611 --> 00:11:29,853
Scott: I don't know.

184
00:11:29,873 --> 00:11:32,210
Rym: I like the idea for now of just making Thursday.

185
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:36,770
Rym: There's no format in terms of we do the news, and then we do the main bit.

186
00:11:37,151 --> 00:11:38,623
Rym: Instead, we might do bits.

187
00:11:38,663 --> 00:11:39,410
Rym: We might just talk.

188
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:44,870
Rym: It'll be kind of the laid-back, relaxed show, because the Friday Night Party line was really fun when we're on it.

189
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:50,830
Rym: We rarely have time to be on it anymore, but that sort of laid-back kind of just talking.

190
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:55,510
Rym: You're not quite -- like, you got a vague idea where you're going, but you don't plan everything out.

191
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:58,870
Rym: You don't have this rigid news thing-of-the-day thing set up, ready to go.

192
00:11:59,835 --> 00:12:01,263
Rym: And I feel like it'll be more natural.

193
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:02,269
Rym: It'll be more fun for us.

194
00:12:02,751 --> 00:12:05,470
Rym: It'll make Thursdays this kind of easy thing to just sit down and talk.

195
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:06,413
Rym: And I don't know.

196
00:12:06,453 --> 00:12:08,690
Rym: People seem to like the conversational style.

197
00:12:09,451 --> 00:12:09,632
Scott: Yeah.

198
00:12:10,176 --> 00:12:18,219
Scott: I just think what you should do is you should have, like, you know, four or five different -- you know, because if it's just talk about whatever, then it's just the lounge.

199
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,030
Scott: That's sort of we're stuck in the same place.

200
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:23,470
Rym: We got to be like -- Well, see, not so much, because talk about whatever.

201
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:28,309
Rym: No, when I say the lounge, I mean it's more that we don't follow the format of news and then a main bit.

202
00:12:28,472 --> 00:12:28,825
Scott: No, no, no.

203
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:33,550
Rym: We might still have a topic, but we might just talk about the topic the whole time.

204
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:39,910
Rym: Or we might talk about the topic for the first half, and then for the second half, we Skype someone in, and then all of us talk about the topic.

205
00:12:40,332 --> 00:12:40,996
Scott: We could do that.

206
00:12:41,378 --> 00:12:49,419
Scott: I'm thinking, though, if we sort of, like, had -- you know, we could do, like, GeekNights Thursday movies, or GeekNights Thursday, right?

207
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,610
Scott: Or GeekNights Thursday book club, right?

208
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:55,869
Scott: Like, people have always wanted us to do regular old book club of normal non-comic books.

209
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:56,675
Rym: You want a book club?

210
00:12:56,796 --> 00:12:58,990
Rym: Read The Darkness That Comes Before.

211
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:00,729
Scott: Yeah, that should be our first one.

212
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,700
Rym: Good God, read those books.

213
00:13:02,721 --> 00:13:04,250
Rym: The Prince of Nothing, R. Scott Bakker.

214
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:08,950
Scott: We could sort of, like, you know, we could do each one of them, like, once a month or every other month.

215
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:19,060
Rym: So it's like Thursday would actually be, like, a bunch of different -- See, at the same time, my only problem with doing them all, like, once a month like that is, now we're suddenly back into the, "Well, it's the third week of the month.

216
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,468
Rym: We got to do the book

217
00:13:20,488 --> 00:13:20,709
Rym: bit.".

218
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:31,910
Scott: Well, no, we could just do is we could have, you know, we come up with, you know, we have Thursday books, we have Thursday Skype someone, we have Thursday, you know, movie, we have Thursday something else, right?

219
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:34,309
Scott: And then we just sort of come in on Thursday and pick one of them.

220
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:39,369
Rym: Yeah, and we can also get to the point where some Thursdays, we just choose four bits.

221
00:13:39,834 --> 00:13:40,507
Scott: We could do that, too.

222
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:43,010
Rym: But I think that's all still long-term.

223
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:48,270
Rym: Right now, all we're going to do is change the style of Thursday, so we're still going to have a topic.

224
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:54,069
Rym: Like, every show will have a topic, but basically, cosmetically, all we're doing is getting rid of the news.

225
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:55,909
Scott: I guess for now.

226
00:13:56,070 --> 00:14:03,710
Rym: But it's more that I think we'll have a more conversational style, and I think GeekNights' Thursdays, over the next few months, is going to evolve rapidly.

227
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:08,769
Rym: And I think you and us will both all kind of know when we hit the sweet spot.

228
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:09,550
Scott: Yeah, probably.

229
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:11,650
Rym: Like, we'll know when it's good, we'll know what works and what doesn't.

230
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:15,229
Scott: You can tell, we can tell when we make a show whether it's a good show or not.

231
00:14:15,571 --> 00:14:19,049
Scott: Like, Monday and Tuesday this week, we're a little eh, but yesterday was really good.

232
00:14:19,591 --> 00:14:21,749
Rym: Even though yesterday was, "Oh, my God.

233
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:23,810
Rym: "Escaflowne is so awesome, Scott.

234
00:14:24,012 --> 00:14:26,070
Rym: "Yeah, Rym, Escaflowne is so awesome.

235
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,883
Rym: "You know why it's so awesome?

236
00:14:27,903 --> 00:14:28,448
Rym: Maybe because it's

237
00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:28,730
Rym: awesome.".

238
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:32,589
Scott: But you could tell, we could tell when we make a show, whether it's good or not.

239
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:33,675
Rym: Sometimes.

240
00:14:33,756 --> 00:14:35,986
Rym: Every now and then, we think, like, "Wow, that was a crap

241
00:14:36,027 --> 00:14:36,230
Rym: show.".

242
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:39,707
Rym: And then people in the forum are like, "Man, that was, like, the best show you guys have done in a

243
00:14:39,768 --> 00:14:40,050
Rym: while.".

244
00:14:40,071 --> 00:14:40,850
Scott: Yeah, I don't know what's up with that.

245
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:41,670
Rym: I think you're all lying.

246
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,606
Rym: I think it's some sort of, "You're trying to bring us

247
00:14:43,646 --> 00:14:43,928
Rym: down.".

248
00:14:44,733 --> 00:14:46,270
Scott: I don't trust the people in the forum, say.

249
00:14:48,832 --> 00:14:51,229
Rym: It is kind of scary how crazy the forums are, but we'll get to that.

250
00:14:52,151 --> 00:15:03,809
Rym: But seriously, I think Thursdays are just going to become this kind of evolving thing, and we debated whether or not we should do this kind of experimentation in the experimental feed, but the decision, and you'll probably see...

251
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:08,810
Scott: There's still going to be experimentation in the experimental feed, but it's going to be more crazy experimentation.

252
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:10,450
Rym: There hasn't been a lot in that feed.

253
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:15,490
Rym: There's been almost nothing in there, because we have been very busy, but we've actually recorded a lot that's going to go in there.

254
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:20,107
Rym: I just have to kind of parse through it and figure out what's worthwhile, and some things we recorded...

255
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:21,930
Scott: Stuff doesn't have to be worthwhile.

256
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,690
Scott: It just has to be worth the Libsyn quota.

257
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,910
Rym: Yeah, some of them aren't even worth that yet.

258
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:26,100
Rym: Yeah.

259
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:33,748
Rym: Like, we recorded a commentary on some Penn and Teller bullshit episodes, but now I know a lot more about the logistics of doing that, so...

260
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:38,466
Scott: Yeah, plus now that I got the video editing, we can actually maybe put those on YouTube instead of...

261
00:15:39,373 --> 00:15:41,230
Rym: Yeah, maybe not the Penn and Teller bullshits.

262
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:42,847
Scott: No, no, no, no, no.

263
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:48,430
Rym: But for now, experimentation with the format is going to be in Thursday.

264
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:54,288
Rym: Experimentation with, you know, "What if Rym and Scott just yell into a microphone for ten

265
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:54,590
Rym: minutes?"

266
00:15:54,711 --> 00:15:56,149
Rym: is going to be in the experimental feed.

267
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:56,646
Scott: Pretty much.

268
00:15:56,991 --> 00:16:01,289
Rym: And also, you might have seen in the forums, there's the GeekNights select feed.

269
00:16:01,571 --> 00:16:04,670
Rym: That's not going to be public for, like, a month, because I've got to figure out how I'm going to do that.

270
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:05,910
Scott: Yeah, I don't know exactly.

271
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:14,708
Scott: You're basically just, you know, trying to aggregate multiple RSS feeds into one and sort of select episodes and...

272
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:18,170
Rym: Well, my idea, my main idea, let's look at anime for an example.

273
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,670
Rym: GeekNights Wednesdays is anime/manga comics.

274
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:26,307
Rym: What if we made a feed that was out there, that was just the anime episodes only of GeekNights...

275
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,090
Scott: Yeah, see, we could do that really easily.

276
00:16:28,171 --> 00:16:36,470
Rym: Yeah, and the anime episodes of Dave and Joel, which I could parse out pretty easily and automatically, and Anime World Order, because they're anime.

277
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:55,710
Rym: And then you've got this feed for people who just care about the anime, because, I mean, we broke up early on, we decided to have these four different feeds for GeekNights, and then, you know, the fifth kind of omnibus feed, and I'm still working on archival feeds, and once we get the new, new, new GeekNights website, which is still a ways out, there's going to be a ton of different feeds.

278
00:16:55,811 --> 00:16:58,830
Rym: You can pretty much pick and choose exactly what GeekNights you want here.

279
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:09,229
Scott: Yeah, when the new website is up, there's going to be like a zillion feeds going on, because right now we've got five, but there'll be just like a whole bunch to be able to, like, sort of subscribe to exactly what you want, and not anything else.

280
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:22,249
Rym: And I feel like some of those feeds are going to, like, this kind of GeekNights Select is just testing for what works and what doesn't, so when we have that new website, I'll know what works and what doesn't, and we can include non-GeekNights content in some of those feeds.

281
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:23,669
Scott: Very possibly.

282
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:25,469
Rym: Because I think a lot of people would like that.

283
00:17:25,675 --> 00:17:25,969
Rym: Maybe.

284
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:27,050
Rym: I don't know.

285
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,148
Rym: I mean, the interest I've gotten...

286
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:31,570
Scott: It's hard to tell, like, how podcast subscriber people work, you know?

287
00:17:32,274 --> 00:17:34,370
Scott: Do they like to subscribe to the thing separately?

288
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:39,026
Rym: Well, considering more than half our downloads are still from people clicking directly on the website...

289
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,230
Scott: Yeah, I know, right?

290
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,610
Scott: So really, how much is it going to matter?

291
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:52,830
Rym: Well, it might, because with the new website, it might be a lot easier to push people into understanding how subscribing works, and also, a lot of those clicks are because a lot of people go through our archives.

292
00:17:53,333 --> 00:18:03,530
Rym: But at most, if you pick the individual feeds, you'll get 100 episodes back per night, so you'll get about 400 episodes back, which already doesn't cover all of GeekNights.

293
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:05,429
Scott: No, it does not.

294
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,330
Scott: No, it does not, sadly.

295
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:19,790
Scott: Yeah, it's just impossible to make an RSS feed sort of big enough to... I guess it's not technically impossible, but, you know, a lot of... A lot of it sucks to put too many episodes in the feed, so... But yeah.

296
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:21,010
Scott: You gotta work around that somehow.

297
00:18:21,251 --> 00:18:30,490
Rym: But also, kind of the drive, just so you all get kind of a perspective here, the drive behind all this is that in the last, I don't know, three or four months, we've kind of hit a threshold.

298
00:18:30,831 --> 00:18:33,106
Rym: Not a plateau, I don't think, but more a threshold.

299
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:37,890
Rym: in terms of we've gotten as good as we can be technically, pretty much.

300
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:42,390
Rym: There's no reason to get better technically at this time, other than website changes and cosmetic things.

301
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:54,090
Rym: And content-wise, I feel like we need to switch it up and kind of kick it up to the next level, because we're scarily edging toward becoming professionals in the actual definition sense of the word.

302
00:18:54,210 --> 00:19:03,110
Scott: I think we just really need to make some changes to keep it more interesting, because it's been sort of getting a little... You know, it's not bad, but it's sort of like the same thing over and over.

303
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:06,349
Scott: We gotta do something a little different to get the spice action going on.

304
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:20,669
Rym: Yeah, and I feel like there's gonna be a lot of changes in the coming couple of years, because, I mean, I really can't talk about the details, but we've got some kind of professional things very, very closer on the horizon than they were, say, a year ago.

305
00:19:21,153 --> 00:19:22,168
Scott: Yeah, we'll see what comes then.

306
00:19:22,631 --> 00:19:25,790
Rym: Yeah, I'm kind of excited about some of these things, but we seriously can't talk about it.

307
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,309
Scott: I don't get excited till shit happens.

308
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,210
Rym: You don't get excited about anything ever.

309
00:19:30,413 --> 00:19:32,050
Scott: I just don't set myself up for disappointment.

310
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:58,330
Rym: See, the thing is, I don't either, because, you know, people always talk about the key to happiness is low expectations, but I think the key to happiness is having very, very rational expectations, because you're not underestimating all the time, you're not just pessimistic and blah, but you're not overestimating and being constantly disappointed, and I think my expectations of where GeekNights is gonna be a year from now are very spot on, and I would be quite surprised if we don't hit at least what I expect.

311
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:04,790
Scott: Alright, so we're still gonna do Things of the Day in every show no matter what.

312
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:05,575
Rym: Yeah, I was 50/50.

313
00:20:05,575 --> 00:20:06,040
Rym: I wasn't sure.

314
00:20:07,212 --> 00:20:08,907
Rym: I was like, "Alright, should we keep Things of the Day or

315
00:20:08,948 --> 00:20:09,109
Rym: not?".

316
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:11,710
Scott: I think we should keep Things of the Day, because that's, like, the thing.

317
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:17,750
Scott: You know, it's like GeekNights, every episode is a Thing of the Day, so it's something to latch onto in every GeekNights show.

318
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:19,381
Scott: It's like, "Thing of the Day time,

319
00:20:19,462 --> 00:20:20,268
Scott: omens!".

320
00:20:20,611 --> 00:20:22,729
Rym: Plus, people seem to really like that music we use.

321
00:20:23,171 --> 00:20:23,594
Scott: I don't know.

322
00:20:23,614 --> 00:20:24,722
Scott: I guess.

323
00:20:24,742 --> 00:20:25,890
Scott: The music's not that great.

324
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:30,070
Rym: Way back when we had guest hosts, we had Movies You Should See guest hosting.

325
00:20:30,431 --> 00:20:32,770
Rym: Actually, there's gonna be a lot more guest hosting this summer.

326
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:36,910
Scott: Yeah, we're gonna start Skyping it up more and more and interviewing and all that.

327
00:20:37,011 --> 00:20:42,670
Rym: The month of August is going to be GeekNights guest hosts, because we're going to conventions, like, three out of the five weekends.

328
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:43,546
Scott: Something like that.

329
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:52,910
Rym: But when Movies You Should See, which you should listen to, they guest hosted, and that was super awesome, and we want to do that more.

330
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:57,110
Rym: But I remember Richard went on and on about that music.

331
00:20:57,231 --> 00:20:57,815
Rym: I just love it.

332
00:20:57,876 --> 00:20:59,648
Rym: I can't do a British accent, but he really liked it.

333
00:21:00,412 --> 00:21:01,088
Scott: Yeah, I guess.

334
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:02,497
Rym: He emailed me twice.

335
00:21:02,537 --> 00:21:04,669
Rym: He was like, "So what was that music, and where can I get

336
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:04,730
Rym: it?".

337
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,146
Rym: And I was like, "Oh, I'll totally send you the

338
00:21:06,186 --> 00:21:06,429
Rym: song.".

339
00:21:07,153 --> 00:21:10,370
Rym: I don't know if I actually sent it to him, or if I just said I would, and then I didn't.

340
00:21:11,793 --> 00:21:12,683
Scott: It's a secret anyway.

341
00:21:12,703 --> 00:21:13,290
Scott: A secret to everybody.

342
00:21:14,632 --> 00:21:16,209
Rym: It's dangerous to go alone and use this.

343
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:18,610
Scott: It's dangerous to go alone and use the secret to everybody.

344
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:30,340
Rym: So anyway, I guess that music was good, but things of the day.

345
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:35,895
Rym: Now, this is all from Michigan, and Scott even asked me when I showed it to him, "Is this some Michigan

346
00:21:35,936 --> 00:21:36,160
Rym: thing?".

347
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:43,580
Rym: I don't think so, but the fact that there's more than one of these in Michigan, I don't know if I just was out of the loop.

348
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:54,040
Rym: Maybe this is from the other parts of the hand that I never went to so much, but the idea behind this video is great, and the video itself is great, so I feel like this is good thing-of-the-day quality.

349
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,219
Rym: Also, it is from neither Dig nor Kaleghumor.

350
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:58,576
Scott: Kaleghumor?

351
00:21:59,140 --> 00:21:59,435
Rym: Kaleghumor.

352
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:00,420
Scott: Kaleghumor.

353
00:22:00,901 --> 00:22:02,640
Rym: I feel like that's a boon, a plus.

354
00:22:03,601 --> 00:22:05,539
Rym: So there's this shoe tree in northern Michigan.

355
00:22:05,701 --> 00:22:08,016
Rym: Basically, this guy was driving on M33.

356
00:22:09,267 --> 00:22:10,020
Rym: Now, a little aside.

357
00:22:10,721 --> 00:22:19,880
Rym: When I moved to New York, I was always confused, because when people said the name of a freeway or a highway or whatever, when they said the name of a highway, they'd use a word name.

358
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,499
Rym: Like, they'd call highways names.

359
00:22:21,681 --> 00:22:24,240
Rym: Like, it's the blah-blah-blah highway or blah-blah-blah street.

360
00:22:24,661 --> 00:22:25,146
Scott: The Taconic.

361
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:26,300
Scott: The Van Wyk.

362
00:22:26,821 --> 00:22:27,769
Rym: Well, those are parkways.

363
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:28,920
Rym: That's special.

364
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,078
Scott: You know, the Merritt.

365
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,507
Rym: But there are no park--.

366
00:22:31,547 --> 00:22:35,820
Rym: Well, I guess there's the Metro Parkway, but that's a different kind of thing in Michigan.

367
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:43,180
Rym: But when people referred to Interstate 90 in New York, and in most of America, they said 90.

368
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,339
Rym: And that always confused me.

369
00:22:45,022 --> 00:22:59,160
Rym: And I realize why now, because outside of the Midwest, the majority of roads that you use with a number are either windy roads, where they often have local names, or they're not super useful or referred to like that, or they're freeways.

370
00:22:59,321 --> 00:23:06,160
Rym: And there aren't a lot of these state and county roads that are major enough to warrant that kind of nomenclature.

371
00:23:07,183 --> 00:23:10,460
Rym: But in Michigan, and in Ohio, and in Indiana, there's interstates.

372
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,799
Scott: You know, like I-- 90 is an interstate.

373
00:23:13,342 --> 00:23:13,687
Rym: I know.

374
00:23:13,728 --> 00:23:14,459
Rym: I'm getting to that.

375
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,212
Rym: But there's interstates, right?

376
00:23:16,313 --> 00:23:17,020
Rym: Like everywhere else.

377
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,147
Rym: There's Interstate 75, I-75.

378
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,266
Rym: There's I-96, I-696, and I-94.

379
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:38,860
Rym: But whenever you refer to a freeway in the Midwest, you always prefix it with the I. And the reason is because there's also M's or the other letters, because like M-33 or M-59 are super major roads.

380
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,779
Rym: They're gigantic freeways.

381
00:23:41,221 --> 00:23:44,660
Rym: They just happen to be state roads instead of interstates.

382
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:48,436
Rym: So M-33 is distinct from if there were an I-33.

383
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:52,152
Rym: So if you go to Michigan, people always say I-95, I-94, M-33.

384
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:54,939
Rym: They say the letter and the number.

385
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,240
Scott: We say I here sometimes, just not always.

386
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,100
Rym: Very rarely.

387
00:23:59,202 --> 00:24:03,640
Rym: Remember that big soda versus pop website study from when you were in college?

388
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,180
Rym: They also had a bunch of other things on there.

389
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,730
Rym: Like they asked about all these sorts of-- Like what do you call this?

390
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,459
Rym: What do you call that?

391
00:24:10,962 --> 00:24:15,600
Rym: And the majority of people who always say like I-90 or whatever are from the Midwest.

392
00:24:16,101 --> 00:24:18,240
Scott: We say I, but not often.

393
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:24,819
Rym: And I feel like I should say it again, because it still sounds weird to me to this day when someone just says a number referring to a road.

394
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,279
Scott: Yeah, well there aren't that many numbered roads.

395
00:24:27,442 --> 00:24:28,478
Scott: Most of the roads have names.

396
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,579
Rym: Well, around here they all have numbers.

397
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:31,716
Scott: Yeah, all some of them.

398
00:24:32,641 --> 00:24:33,813
Rym: Actually, all of them.

399
00:24:33,874 --> 00:24:34,500
Rym: All the real roads.

400
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,699
Rym: All the state and county roads.

401
00:24:36,983 --> 00:24:38,159
Scott: Yeah, those are big roads.

402
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:43,066
Rym: Well, I think part of it is that you never really drove out in the east where-- Like I used to take-- What do you mean?

403
00:24:43,086 --> 00:24:43,879
Scott: I only drove in the east?

404
00:24:44,461 --> 00:24:46,040
Rym: No, like in this state around here.

405
00:24:47,241 --> 00:24:55,523
Rym: My commute to IBM was I would take 55 to 216 to 33 to 35.

406
00:24:55,523 --> 00:24:58,540
Rym: And the roads all had names, but only the old people knew them and no one else did.

407
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,098
Scott: But anyway, that's-- Post office knows them.

408
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,067
Rym: Of course they do.

409
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:03,320
Rym: That's an aside.

410
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,920
Rym: On M33, this guy was driving and he stopped because he saw a tree that was full of shoes.

411
00:25:12,042 --> 00:25:13,759
Rym: Like they were just hanging from it, hundreds of them.

412
00:25:14,241 --> 00:25:14,563
Scott: Now,

413
00:25:14,603 --> 00:25:26,240
Rym: you know all those times in your life where you're driving somewhere, you're out somewhere, or like Scott and I, you're driving in the road and you see something weird and there's no one around and you keep going or you stop and look at it, but there's no one there.

414
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:30,540
Scott: Or you see something just even walking and you know that's a weird thing.

415
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:36,099
Scott: There's a story behind that weird thing, but there's no way for me to find out what that story is.

416
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:46,779
Rym: You're walking down the street, like alone in your hometown, and suddenly a naked guy with his hair on fire rides a bicycle past you screaming and goes around the corner and no one else saw it.

417
00:25:47,281 --> 00:25:49,618
Rym: You're going to be wondering, "What the fuck was up with

418
00:25:49,659 --> 00:25:49,840
Rym: that?".

419
00:25:50,621 --> 00:25:59,944
Rym: But unless you happen, like it happens to be big enough to make the news, or you happen to run into someone else who saw it, but even then they might say, "Hey, did you see that thing?

420
00:25:59,984 --> 00:26:00,969
Rym: Yeah, what was up with that?

421
00:26:01,009 --> 00:26:01,753
Rym: Damn, if I know.

422
00:26:01,773 --> 00:26:02,537
Rym: Oh,

423
00:26:02,597 --> 00:26:02,838
Rym: great.".

424
00:26:03,504 --> 00:26:04,520
Rym: And if it wasn't for that horse.

425
00:26:05,381 --> 00:26:06,085
Scott: Yeah, it's weird.

426
00:26:06,105 --> 00:26:12,699
Scott: It's like you can walk around the world and you can see things which basically say, "A story happened

427
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:12,880
Scott: here.".

428
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:20,431
Scott: It might have been lame, it might have been funny, but it's sort of, you know, how that got that way.

429
00:26:20,451 --> 00:26:25,100
Scott: There had to be a story behind it, and there's often no way to find out that story.

430
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:34,729
Rym: So this guy, being brilliant, stopped, pulled out his camera, filmed a tree, and then he made a little video that he put on YouTube, basically saying, "Hey, I'm this guy.

431
00:26:35,532 --> 00:26:37,360
Rym: What's up with this shoe tree?

432
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,986
Rym: It's on M33.

433
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:40,230
Rym: Look at it.

434
00:26:40,551 --> 00:26:42,740
Rym: There's all these shoes, all different kinds.

435
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,466
Rym: Seriously, what's the deal?

436
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:46,115
Rym: Will someone please tell

437
00:26:46,155 --> 00:26:46,256
Rym: me?".

438
00:26:47,221 --> 00:26:51,340
Rym: And I think that this concept needs to catch on in a big way.

439
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:59,718
Rym: I want everyone who sees something weird to make a blog post or a YouTube or something and ask about it, because hopefully we can start answering these mysteries.

440
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:00,101
Rym: Yeah,

441
00:27:00,121 --> 00:27:05,516
Scott: I mean, every time something, you know, you go, "Hey," every time you think, "What's the story behind that weird

442
00:27:05,556 --> 00:27:05,818
Scott: thing?"

443
00:27:06,341 --> 00:27:14,740
Scott: make a YouTube or take a picture or something and put it on the internet and ask people what the story behind it is, and eventually we'll start to get answers.

444
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:20,679
Scott: The problem is, most of the time you get these bullshit answers that are obviously like Snopes.com territory.

445
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:28,620
Rym: Yeah, but the thing is you can tell, because the only people who would be able to make up a quality bullshit answer are locals who know enough about the area.

446
00:27:29,422 --> 00:27:29,899
Rym: That's true.

447
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:30,664
Rym: For the most part.

448
00:27:30,684 --> 00:27:42,677
Rym: I mean, you can usually sniff them out by subtle details and whatever, but I point out that one of the responses he got was, "There was a shoe tree in Northville on 9 Mile Road west of Beck,".

449
00:27:44,102 --> 00:27:46,198
Rym: to which Scott asked, "What, are shoe trees a thing in

450
00:27:46,238 --> 00:27:46,440
Rym: Michigan?".

451
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:51,998
Rym: because I'm wondering now, because actually the person who wrote that comment is from Sterling Heights, where I grew up.

452
00:27:52,522 --> 00:27:52,720
Rym: All right.

453
00:27:53,180 --> 00:28:00,620
Rym: So there you go, but one guy kind of gave an answer, but he's not sure if it's the real answer, but I don't know.

454
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,412
Rym: This is kind of cool.

455
00:28:01,452 --> 00:28:01,879
Rym: Check it out.

456
00:28:03,364 --> 00:28:03,444
Scott: Yeah.

457
00:28:03,464 --> 00:28:07,220
Scott: All right, so, you know, Google has lots of stuff that they do, right?

458
00:28:07,401 --> 00:28:08,429
Scott: Like a billion things.

459
00:28:08,449 --> 00:28:11,580
Scott: You don't even know half of the stuff, services that Google offers, right?

460
00:28:12,043 --> 00:28:13,492
Rym: That was a nice global statement.

461
00:28:13,532 --> 00:28:14,740
Rym: Are you going to bring it down to a thesis?

462
00:28:15,166 --> 00:28:15,518
Scott: Oh, yeah.

463
00:28:16,221 --> 00:28:23,479
Scott: I discovered a Google service recently that I was not previously aware of, even though now I think it's kind of an old one, but I didn't know about it.

464
00:28:24,101 --> 00:28:25,519
Rym: They have this search engine?

465
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,552
Scott: Yeah, the Google search engine.

466
00:28:27,592 --> 00:28:28,520
Scott: It's like the greatest thing.

467
00:28:28,701 --> 00:28:32,113
Scott: I didn't know how to do this mail and maps, but do you know how they did?

468
00:28:32,153 --> 00:28:32,719
Scott: a search engine?

469
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:36,700
Scott: Anyway, no, so Google does this chart thing.

470
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:37,589
Scott: Google charts.

471
00:28:37,609 --> 00:28:38,239
Scott: You ever hear of that?

472
00:28:38,947 --> 00:28:39,199
Scott: Never.

473
00:28:39,421 --> 00:28:39,723
Scott: Never.

474
00:28:39,803 --> 00:28:48,678
Scott: So, you know, when you're doing computing, right, you know, one of the hardest things to do on a computer for some weird reason is make charts, you know, pie charts.

475
00:28:49,701 --> 00:28:50,780
Rym: Excel or OpenOffice.

476
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,100
Rym: Yeah, Excel or OpenOffice.

477
00:28:52,881 --> 00:28:53,488
Rym: Or Gnuplot.

478
00:28:53,751 --> 00:28:54,560
Rym: It's super easy.

479
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,580
Scott: No, Gnuplot's kind of lame.

480
00:28:57,501 --> 00:29:01,180
Rym: I've been using Gnuplot and I think Ploticus was the other one I was using.

481
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,180
Scott: I never even heard of Ploticus.

482
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,640
Rym: Oh, I've actually been making a lot of fancy charts at work lately.

483
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:06,318
Rym: But anyway.

484
00:29:06,521 --> 00:29:13,440
Rym: I've been writing awesome scripts, like Python scripts that just make fancy looking charts and then I copy them to other people and update them in real time.

485
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,079
Rym: And charts are not difficult to make.

486
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:18,160
Scott: Well, charts are, you know, charts are problematic.

487
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,540
Scott: I mean, okay, so I make a chart in Excel, right?

488
00:29:20,923 --> 00:29:21,880
Scott: How good does it look?

489
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,960
Scott: You know, how do I get it, you know, to look exactly the way I want?

490
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,459
Scott: It's not super easy.

491
00:29:27,701 --> 00:29:29,773
Scott: And then I want to like put it on a webpage.

492
00:29:29,853 --> 00:29:34,580
Scott: maybe, you know, or maybe I want to dynamically generate charts on my webpage.

493
00:29:34,761 --> 00:29:38,680
Scott: Now I need to go and get some like PHP library that does charting.

494
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,960
Rym: Python script plus like Gnuplot or Ploticus.

495
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,560
Scott: There's a lot of, it's not as good as it could be.

496
00:29:44,601 --> 00:29:45,098
Rym: Or MRTG.

497
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:45,880
Scott: No.

498
00:29:47,303 --> 00:29:49,600
Scott: And I want the charts to look good too, right?

499
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:57,060
Scott: Google charts makes this like a billion times better than all those other solutions that we just rattled off there.

500
00:29:57,781 --> 00:29:59,660
Scott: The way Google charts works is very easy.

501
00:30:00,283 --> 00:30:10,140
Scott: You type in a URL to Google charts, then you type slash, then you type in all the parameters for the charts, like the data and the labels and they know the type of chart you want.

502
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:11,600
Scott: And then you push enter.

503
00:30:12,301 --> 00:30:15,856
Scott: And what will happen is an image file like a ping will load.

504
00:30:16,077 --> 00:30:16,800
Scott: that is your chart.

505
00:30:17,164 --> 00:30:18,600
Scott: And it will load pretty much immediately.

506
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,380
Scott: So you make say a web application, right?

507
00:30:23,223 --> 00:30:25,039
Scott: And you want to put a chart in the middle of the page.

508
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:27,320
Scott: So let's say you want to chart like some numbers.

509
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:34,680
Scott: So you would, you know, get the numbers from wherever you got them from, say maybe count some things in your database and sum them some things in your database.

510
00:30:35,143 --> 00:30:36,959
Rym: One batty, batty, batty, batty.

511
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:42,819
Scott: So take those counts and those sums, put them inside a URL, put the URL in an IMG tag.

512
00:30:43,301 --> 00:30:47,900
Scott: Boom, you have a beautiful, wonderful, amazing chart on your web page.

513
00:30:47,981 --> 00:30:49,000
Scott: that's just an image.

514
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,740
Scott: People can right click on the image and save it.

515
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,520
Scott: It's just an image.

516
00:30:51,561 --> 00:30:52,380
Scott: It's not anything weird.

517
00:30:52,661 --> 00:30:54,400
Scott: No flash, no bullshit.

518
00:30:54,965 --> 00:30:55,819
Scott: And it just works.

519
00:30:56,485 --> 00:30:58,320
Scott: And you can make really cool charts.

520
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:04,300
Scott: And this is even useful even if you're not making a web page because, OK, I want to make a cool like radar chart.

521
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:07,300
Scott: So I type in the URL for a radar chart.

522
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:09,100
Scott: I push enter the chart loads.

523
00:31:09,426 --> 00:31:09,978
Scott: I save it.

524
00:31:10,282 --> 00:31:12,320
Scott: Then I put it in like a word document or something.

525
00:31:12,402 --> 00:31:13,298
Scott: You know, it's just an image.

526
00:31:14,002 --> 00:31:17,619
Scott: It just Google generated the image for you based on the URL you typed in.

527
00:31:18,342 --> 00:31:21,820
Scott: So Google charts is super useful and super awesome.

528
00:31:21,901 --> 00:31:27,399
Scott: And I can't believe I never discovered it before, but I'm totally using it for all charts for now on.

529
00:31:28,864 --> 00:31:29,779
Scott: You got to see this, man.

530
00:31:30,041 --> 00:31:31,599
Scott: It can make some crazy kind of charts.

531
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:32,498
Rym: All right.

532
00:31:32,822 --> 00:31:33,096
Scott: All right.

533
00:31:33,361 --> 00:31:35,880
Rym: So we want to describe someone in and do that for fun.

534
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:41,638
Rym: But while I was digging out the cables to hook all that back up, Scott discovered that no one wanted to talk to us.

535
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,839
Scott: Well, some people did want to, but it was going to be more trouble than it was worth.

536
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,776
Scott: And, you know, you didn't get the cables out and we was getting late and I want to eat.

537
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,760
Scott: So we didn't get anyone to, you know, basically go for it quick enough.

538
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,559
Scott: We needed someone basically to just jump on.

539
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,719
Rym: But luckily a funny thing happened on the way to the farm.

540
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:03,700
Scott: That joke is really not funny.

541
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:04,860
Rym: It's not funny.

542
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,499
Rym: It's not a joke.

543
00:32:05,581 --> 00:32:06,100
Rym: It's a reference.

544
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:06,820
Rym: It's a big difference.

545
00:32:07,768 --> 00:32:08,580
Scott: It's a little grating.

546
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,760
Rym: A joke was when you called me a weeper yesterday.

547
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,720
Scott: That was a good joke.

548
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:12,496
Rym: That was really good.

549
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:13,460
Scott: Anyway.

550
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,640
Scott: So, yeah, we've only done this, I think, once before.

551
00:32:16,741 --> 00:32:19,100
Scott: So I don't feel too bad about doing it again.

552
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:25,720
Scott: We're just going to go through the forum and hopefully looking at the forum will spur discussions.

553
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:29,380
Scott: And that will basically kill time for the rest of the episode.

554
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:33,199
Rym: One thing I can say, though, is our forums are really rocking, like kind of scary.

555
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,340
Scott: They're too rocking.

556
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,400
Rym: I can't keep up with them.

557
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:39,719
Rym: I'm four pages back and there's like 50 topics on the right that I haven't even looked at.

558
00:32:40,251 --> 00:32:40,440
Scott: Yeah.

559
00:32:40,581 --> 00:32:44,840
Scott: I like I'll, you know, sort of middle click on every unread thing by habit.

560
00:32:45,062 --> 00:32:46,620
Scott: But most of them, I just end up closing.

561
00:32:46,941 --> 00:32:52,520
Scott: I'll be like, open, open, open, open, open, close, close, close, close, read, close, read, close, close, close.

562
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:56,420
Rym: I'm thinking what we're going to have to do is we might maybe have more categories or something.

563
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:07,400
Rym: But in the end, what we really need to do is I think people are going to have to start using the categories as their default view, because otherwise there's more things said than fit on the front page all the time now.

564
00:33:08,001 --> 00:33:11,100
Rym: And our forum is almost a chat room in some regards.

565
00:33:11,181 --> 00:33:19,600
Rym: And while that's a good view and it's fun to do that, I feel like you're better served by just having, I don't know, categories open and kind of using it like a traditional forum more.

566
00:33:19,861 --> 00:33:20,123
Scott: Yeah.

567
00:33:20,163 --> 00:33:28,180
Scott: The thing is I like vanilla mostly because it didn't do the categories and it sort of put them in the background that I like the, just the full on discussion more than the category.

568
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:28,501
Rym: Yeah.

569
00:33:28,522 --> 00:33:29,499
Rym: It's just, it's getting crazy.

570
00:33:30,282 --> 00:33:30,990
Scott: I'm fine with it.

571
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:32,000
Scott: Whatever.

572
00:33:32,704 --> 00:33:33,559
Rym: I can't say one thing.

573
00:33:34,061 --> 00:33:39,620
Rym: It's funny to see all the political threads because Scott seems to make a point of coming in and talking about how little he cares about politics.

574
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,225
Scott: That's right.

575
00:33:40,266 --> 00:33:41,379
Scott: That's, that's the best thing to do.

576
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:46,660
Rym: Quote Scott, I was happier about politics when I was a kid and didn't know or care about the difference between a liberal and a conservative.

577
00:33:46,861 --> 00:33:47,123
Scott: Yep.

578
00:33:47,183 --> 00:33:48,130
Scott: Those are good times.

579
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:49,620
Scott: Good times.

580
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,177
Rym: Well, you see.

581
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:56,315
Scott: When I was in first grade and I, and they pass out little pieces of paper and said, "Vote for," was it Bush or Dukakis, I think, right?

582
00:33:56,395 --> 00:33:56,777
Scott: Was that it?

583
00:33:57,741 --> 00:33:58,980
Scott: And I forget.

584
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:02,800
Scott: And I was like Bush because his name is funny.

585
00:34:03,182 --> 00:34:04,049
Scott: Those are good times.

586
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,319
Scott: Things are much happier then.

587
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:11,120
Rym: I campaigned on behalf of Clinton in my elementary school's kind of mock election.

588
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:12,121
Scott: Yeah.

589
00:34:12,141 --> 00:34:17,260
Scott: By the, when it was, when we got around to Clinton times, I still didn't know the difference between left and right.

590
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:23,320
Scott: All I knew is that every, every politician on TV was a bullshit liar piece of shit and I hated all of them.

591
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,460
Scott: And I couldn't trust anyone and everyone sucked.

592
00:34:26,801 --> 00:34:27,929
Rym: It was actually kind of sad.

593
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:32,860
Rym: I remember I was in 10th grade and I knew about politics largely from reading Bloom County when I was younger.

594
00:34:33,223 --> 00:34:34,719
Rym: So I knew a lot about eighties politics.

595
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:56,359
Rym: But we, you know, I was first day of my 10th grade of high school and I'm in this world kind of government social studies history class and the teacher who later on I found out was a dyed in the wool communist, not like Soviet, but like he was like, he lent me books and he like me and the other like three kids who we thought were smart and he thought he could trust.

596
00:34:56,942 --> 00:34:57,967
Rym: He kept lending us books.

597
00:34:58,349 --> 00:35:02,660
Rym: Like I remember he lent me Marx and Soho, which is actually a pretty good play, but that's not a bad gun.

598
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:06,959
Rym: I like it a lot, but it got more and more hammer and sickle.

599
00:35:08,382 --> 00:35:10,739
Scott: And finally I was like, I like hammer and sickle.

600
00:35:12,182 --> 00:35:13,340
Scott: Hammers and sickles are cool.

601
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:20,860
Rym: I really like Soviet propaganda and Soviet style and music and all these things, but not so much the Soviet system of government.

602
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,119
Scott: No, we're ignoring mostly the economic system.

603
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,340
Rym: Yeah, but the economic system in theory would have been cool.

604
00:35:26,841 --> 00:35:33,480
Scott: A lot of things in theory are cool, but you know, it's very rare that something in theory actually works in reality except for memristors.

605
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,070
Rym: Ah, memristors.

606
00:35:36,232 --> 00:35:37,400
Rym: Where was I going with this?

607
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:37,965
Rym: I was going somewhere.

608
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,559
Scott: You're talking about the, you know, politics threads.

609
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:42,984
Rym: Oh yeah.

610
00:35:43,468 --> 00:35:44,960
Rym: Oh yeah, but what was I going to say?

611
00:35:45,661 --> 00:35:46,500
Rym: But it wasn't communism.

612
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,325
Scott: Well, you were done.

613
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:49,500
Scott: You want to go, let's move around in the forum some more.

614
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,544
Rym: Oh, right, right, right.

615
00:35:50,644 --> 00:35:51,147
Rym: 10th grade.

616
00:35:52,152 --> 00:35:53,880
Rym: Man, I opened up that communist thread.

617
00:35:54,743 --> 00:35:57,120
Rym: But anyway, so we're in there and he opens the class.

618
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:02,757
Rym: He's like, so how has America changed in the last 30 years?

619
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:10,560
Rym: And I raised my hand and everyone else raised their hand and someone else gets called on and they said something stupid.

620
00:36:11,322 --> 00:36:12,399
Scott: How stupid could it be?

621
00:36:13,401 --> 00:36:15,178
Rym: It was like, people are older now.

622
00:36:16,202 --> 00:36:16,445
Scott: I know.

623
00:36:17,154 --> 00:36:17,498
Scott: Try again.

624
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,288
Rym: And the thing is, it wasn't like they were being funny.

625
00:36:19,308 --> 00:36:25,979
Rym: Anyway, but then I said, well, it seems like in a lot of ways we've kind of moved toward the left.

626
00:36:27,803 --> 00:36:29,580
Rym: And the teacher's like, oh, that's an interesting observation.

627
00:36:29,741 --> 00:36:34,640
Rym: I would argue this move more towards the right, but it depends on whether we're talking about economics or politics.

628
00:36:36,123 --> 00:36:38,160
Rym: And then the rest of the class is like, what?

629
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:45,600
Rym: And then the same girl, the girl who was famous for asking at one point, so do we still have troops in Vietnam?

630
00:36:46,781 --> 00:36:51,220
Rym: And wait a minute, we used a nuclear weapon?

631
00:36:53,167 --> 00:36:53,778
Rym: Did it work?

632
00:36:55,642 --> 00:36:56,179
Scott: Good God.

633
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:00,960
Rym: This girl was not the, but she asks, like, what do you mean to the left?

634
00:37:02,325 --> 00:37:03,939
Rym: And I looked at her like, wow.

635
00:37:04,361 --> 00:37:06,737
Rym: But then the rest of the class was like, yeah, what do you mean left?

636
00:37:07,662 --> 00:37:09,600
Scott: See, I knew that there was left and right.

637
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:13,480
Scott: And I knew that Democrats are one and Republicans are the other.

638
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:21,220
Scott: But it wasn't until like the late 90s that I actually bothered to care and sort it all out because I just really didn't care.

639
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:33,160
Rym: I learned when I was a kid, mostly from Bloom County, I remember a joke where someone accused Opus of being a left winger and he's flapping his left wing and I kind of associated liberalism with left and conservatism with right and I was correct.

640
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:34,872
Rym: So I guess I had a 50/50 shot.

641
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,877
Scott: Yeah, it was always a 50/50 shot, but it's one of those things like, uh.

642
00:37:40,161 --> 00:37:51,660
Scott: And, you know, I basically had no, it was like in those days, you know, I mostly viewed, my political opinion was always like a political science opinion.

643
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:55,840
Scott: You know, like I wouldn't stand for, you know, left or right.

644
00:37:55,961 --> 00:38:04,876
Scott: I would stand for, say, something like, you know, well, the Constitution says this, you know, and I would always be a very academic opinion when I had one, you know, something like that.

645
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:21,488
Scott: And, you know, if you look, that's one reason where even when the Supreme Court is filled with a bunch of crazies, like it sometimes is, you know, they always seem to make their decisions based on the raw political science as opposed to bullshit.

646
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:24,280
Scott: That's only sometimes, you know, sometimes they don't do that.

647
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:24,863
Rym: Well, it's tricky.

648
00:38:24,883 --> 00:38:37,660
Rym: I think what a lot of people need to do that I definitely do, like I do this to a degree that often irks a lot of people I try to debate politics with, but I have two completely separate set of political ideals.

649
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:52,939
Rym: I, on one hand, I will take everything from the political science, like not necessarily policies or issues, but like political theory, like not what should we do about X, but how should the government decide what to do about X?

650
00:38:53,382 --> 00:38:58,229
Rym: And I'll take an agnostic stance in terms of what they actually will do, what they should do, morals, whatever.

651
00:38:58,269 --> 00:39:02,419
Rym: I just talk, I think about politically, how should we determine this?

652
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:02,781
Rym: Yep.

653
00:39:03,022 --> 00:39:11,160
Scott: Well, I mean, the classic example, right, is let's say New York state makes a law and that law says something good, something I like, right?

654
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:15,440
Rym: It's like when we ban smoking, which is like the best thing to ever happen in New York state.

655
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:15,962
Scott: All right.

656
00:39:15,982 --> 00:39:16,524
Scott: So, all right.

657
00:39:16,564 --> 00:39:18,916
Scott: So let's say New York state bans smoking.

658
00:39:18,996 --> 00:39:19,257
Scott: Okay.

659
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:19,780
Scott: That's fine.

660
00:39:20,522 --> 00:39:21,365
Scott: You know, okay.

661
00:39:21,606 --> 00:39:23,091
Scott: I agree with that entirely.

662
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:25,459
Scott: I am very happy with that decision.

663
00:39:25,479 --> 00:39:27,199
Rym: However- Just from a personal issue standpoint.

664
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:27,841
Scott: Right.

665
00:39:27,881 --> 00:39:35,960
Scott: But the question is, is New York state, do they, does the state have the right to pass that law?

666
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:44,309
Scott: Is that something that is within the realm of the state's rights, or is that something that is within the realm of the federal government's rights, according to the constitution.

667
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:48,739
Scott: and, you know, even if it isn't right, according to the constitution, or if it is, should it be?

668
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,720
Scott: So, you know, a lot of times, right, like there'll be a law like that.

669
00:39:52,941 --> 00:39:57,620
Scott: And the people who agree with the law will say, oh, no, no, don't overturn it, whatever.

670
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:01,920
Scott: And if it gets overturned, they're like, oh, you guys suck your evil blah, right?

671
00:40:02,801 --> 00:40:14,660
Scott: And even if, you know, I'll agree that I like the law, sometimes I'll still say we should overturn it because it's, you know, an issue of, you know, the deeper political science of, yes, I agree.

672
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,324
Scott: I like that.

673
00:40:15,404 --> 00:40:17,779
Scott: I would like it if there were a law like that, but you know what?

674
00:40:18,446 --> 00:40:19,759
Scott: The state doesn't have the right to do that.

675
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,810
Rym: Or like a really good example is Roe vs.

676
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:27,476
Rym: Wade because I can't stress to you enough how much I agree with the Roe vs.

677
00:40:27,516 --> 00:40:28,020
Rym: Wade decision.

678
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,537
Scott: I agree with that women should have the right to everything.

679
00:40:31,598 --> 00:40:32,080
Scott: It's awesome.

680
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,745
Scott: But Roe vs.

681
00:40:33,866 --> 00:40:37,580
Scott: Wade itself, it's not constitutional.

682
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:42,340
Rym: Well, the thing is, it technically is because the Supreme Court gets to interpret the Constitution.

683
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,059
Scott: That's correct, but in my opinion, it's not constitutional.

684
00:40:46,521 --> 00:40:47,887
Rym: It's not unconstitutional.

685
00:40:48,329 --> 00:40:50,739
Rym: It was a really crappy way to go about it.

686
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:55,860
Scott: But at the same time, I think they should have used my favorite amendment instead of using the.

687
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:01,080
Rym: Well, but at the same time, I feel as though the Supreme Court in the end did the right thing.

688
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:08,680
Rym: It was kind of a situation where the political climate at the time was going to was very hostile to this sort of thing.

689
00:41:09,122 --> 00:41:11,140
Rym: And a bad thing would have been done.

690
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:17,100
Rym: Like if people if abortions had been banned and all sorts of bad things happen, I think it would have been terrible for this country.

691
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:28,519
Rym: And the fact that the Supreme Court exercised its adversarial balances, balance of powers, you know, ability to do something and to take it to say we're going to do this.

692
00:41:29,424 --> 00:41:30,760
Rym: I think in the end it was the right decision.

693
00:41:31,001 --> 00:41:34,360
Scott: Yeah, they could have made a lot worse decisions, that's for sure.

694
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:47,300
Rym: But to go back to the problematic decision, from an issue standpoint, I am for pretty much all restrictions on smoking on a personal, nonpolitical level because I really don't respect people who smoke in general because it smells bad.

695
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,498
Rym: I don't like to be around them.

696
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,520
Rym: And just the smell of it really, really bothers me.

697
00:41:51,641 --> 00:41:53,279
Rym: And I'm totally cool with banning it.

698
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:58,580
Scott: And how can you respect how can it's really hard to respect someone who like poisons themselves knowingly.

699
00:41:59,446 --> 00:42:00,200
Scott: Like if you want.

700
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,799
Rym: However, I've got a corona in my hand half finished.

701
00:42:04,361 --> 00:42:04,903
Scott: Yeah, that's it.

702
00:42:04,923 --> 00:42:09,500
Scott: You know, but even so, I mean, like imagine if, you know, someone came up and they're like a really smart doctor.

703
00:42:09,581 --> 00:42:11,340
Scott: Then we're going to give a speech at TED, right?

704
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:16,040
Scott: And right before, right, they give the speech, they're like, see this?

705
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:21,720
Scott: This is enough cyanide to kill someone minus a little bit so I'm not actually going to die.

706
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:25,400
Scott: And then they drink it and you're like, uh, what's wrong with this crazy guy?

707
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:26,506
Rym: I don't care what people do.

708
00:42:26,828 --> 00:42:28,660
Rym: I don't care if they're poisoning themselves or anything.

709
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,362
Scott: No, I don't care.

710
00:42:30,025 --> 00:42:32,433
Scott: But it's kind of like, huh, you're crazy.

711
00:42:32,453 --> 00:42:34,320
Scott: I'm not going to respect you.

712
00:42:34,561 --> 00:42:39,620
Rym: My personal nonpolitical issue is simply that I dislike cigarette smoke.

713
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:46,600
Rym: So in an adversarial kind of governmental system, a democracy, I fight to get what I want.

714
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,520
Rym: And other people fight to get what they want.

715
00:42:48,640 --> 00:43:00,920
Rym: And hopefully the political process balances the needs of the many with the rights of the few in order to come up with the best possible workable solution between all the different wants, needs, desires, and et cetera of all the people.

716
00:43:01,581 --> 00:43:03,584
Rym: So my issue stance is ban it all.

717
00:43:04,025 --> 00:43:13,380
Rym: My political stance is New York state has the right to do it and the constituency, by and large, the vast majority of New Yorkers wanted this ban.

718
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:15,887
Rym: So I feel as though politically it was justified.

719
00:43:16,168 --> 00:43:19,420
Rym: And I feel as though it's more of a state issue than a federal issue.

720
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:30,580
Rym: Now, if we got to the point where a city in the state wanted to override it or overrule it, I'm not really sure how I feel, but that's a state constitutional issue, not a federal issue.

721
00:43:30,801 --> 00:43:32,959
Scott: Yeah, we should read the state constitution of New York.

722
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:34,162
Rym: It's interesting.

723
00:43:34,202 --> 00:43:39,400
Rym: I haven't read all of it, but I've read certain passages that have been very relevant to issues I've been concerned about.

724
00:43:40,861 --> 00:43:52,958
Rym: I don't know about whether or not a city or a municipality or county should have the right to overturn smoking legislation, but I definitely feel that the state of New York is well within its rights to regulate smoking.

725
00:43:52,999 --> 00:43:53,960
Rym: however it will see fit.

726
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:54,481
Scott: Oh yeah.

727
00:43:54,944 --> 00:43:56,855
Scott: Alright, let's move around the forum a little bit more.

728
00:43:56,875 --> 00:43:57,700
Scott: See what else is in here.

729
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:58,138
Scott: Alright.

730
00:43:58,601 --> 00:43:58,902
Scott: Okay.

731
00:43:58,922 --> 00:44:02,092
Scott: Here's some basically, uh, you know, things dragged up from the past.

732
00:44:02,132 --> 00:44:04,940
Scott: Someone says they're starting a retro gaming collection right now.

733
00:44:05,781 --> 00:44:10,518
Scott: I've gone on a rant about collecting before and collecting is a geekery.

734
00:44:10,538 --> 00:44:11,120
Scott: Alright.

735
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:13,919
Rym: But Scott's a little more vitriolic than I'm going to be.

736
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:18,628
Scott: Yeah, but collecting is a waste of time and money pretty much.

737
00:44:18,708 --> 00:44:20,631
Scott: You know, why are you going to?

738
00:44:20,671 --> 00:44:25,700
Scott: basically, collecting is basically enjoying having things.

739
00:44:27,123 --> 00:44:28,487
Scott: Why do you want to have things?

740
00:44:28,527 --> 00:44:30,552
Scott: Having things doesn't do anything for you.

741
00:44:30,612 --> 00:44:33,840
Scott: I mean, if you like to, if you like video games, right?

742
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:38,732
Rym: Alright Scott, I don't think you need to go into your stupid rant again, but like, Dune.

743
00:44:39,053 --> 00:44:41,480
Rym: On one hand, I wanted Dune because I wanted to play it.

744
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:48,080
Rym: On the other hand, I do, I'll admit that I enjoy the fact that I have this old out of print rare board game and I can be like, check this out.

745
00:44:48,723 --> 00:44:49,358
Scott: Eh, not really.

746
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:51,205
Rym: I can be like, check it out.

747
00:44:51,526 --> 00:44:55,317
Rym: We have emulators, but let's totally play the Atari on the Atari.

748
00:44:55,477 --> 00:44:56,320
Rym: Oh man, this is fun.

749
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:59,410
Rym: I mean, when we brought that Atari to Katsucon.

750
00:44:59,511 --> 00:45:01,820
Scott: Right, for playing it, not for collecting.

751
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,916
Rym: But if you just look at them, people walked over and they're like, wow, an Atari.

752
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:12,340
Scott: Well, that's, that's the, I mean, if you had, there's nothing wrong with having old things, right?

753
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:21,620
Scott: And there's nothing wrong with, in fact, it's better to share your old things that might be rare with other people to, you know, that's the purpose of the things is to be enjoyed, right?

754
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:29,340
Scott: The kind of collecting that bothers me is like, you know, comic books, they have like the, these slabs where you take your comic book, you give it to these people.

755
00:45:29,661 --> 00:45:38,080
Scott: They'll grade the condition of it on a scale from one to 10 with a decimal point, even they'll put it in an unopenable, like plastic thing.

756
00:45:38,582 --> 00:45:40,769
Scott: And then it's like, oh, this isn't going to be read anymore.

757
00:45:40,789 --> 00:45:44,020
Scott: It's, it's now an item to be bought and sold and, and blah.

758
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:47,378
Scott: And they're doing the same thing with video games now too, like museums.

759
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:53,560
Scott: Yeah, but the point of a museum is that people come and enjoy the thing, right?

760
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:54,760
Rym: By looking at it, but you got to preserve it.

761
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:59,859
Scott: Well, no, but if there was a video game museum, the video games would be playable in the museum.

762
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:00,882
Rym: No, not necessarily.

763
00:46:00,922 --> 00:46:07,340
Rym: I mean, like, look, that Game Boy that was blowed up in the first Iraq war and still works, you don't let people touch that.

764
00:46:07,641 --> 00:46:14,180
Scott: No, but yeah, well, I mean, yeah, but I mean, if you had a video game museum, you would have to have playable video games.

765
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:23,340
Rym: Yes, but you might also have a lot of rare items or like rare video games like that Atlantis cartridge, probably like behind glass and you just look at them and enjoy them.

766
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:27,719
Scott: Yeah, but you would also have some that were available for playing as well.

767
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:31,140
Rym: Yeah, but some and not all doesn't really agree with your argument.

768
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:39,540
Scott: You would take the destroyed in war Game Boy sitting there and then you would have a normal Game Boy sitting next to it for playing.

769
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:44,220
Rym: Well, if you could, but the fact that you also have things under glass that people don't touch to preserve them.

770
00:46:44,621 --> 00:46:46,019
Scott: Yeah, yeah, but the point is...

771
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:47,386
Rym: Someone's got to preserve it.

772
00:46:47,426 --> 00:46:50,800
Rym: At least one person has to preserve the original whatever.

773
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:58,340
Scott: The point is that you're sharing them and you're not just hoarding these things and, you know, sealing them for your sake of obsessive compulsive disorder.

774
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:01,599
Rym: Most people who have collections love nothing more than showing them off.

775
00:47:02,561 --> 00:47:07,760
Scott: Yeah, but a lot of people, they just keep these things in their houses and I think they love nothing more than organizing.

776
00:47:07,921 --> 00:47:09,580
Rym: I think you're making a lot of assumptions.

777
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,996
Scott: And a lot of them, they're in it because they talk about, "Oh, it's an

778
00:47:13,017 --> 00:47:13,600
Scott: investment.".

779
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:15,240
Rym: That's just a completely separate argument.

780
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:15,589
Rym: Yeah.

781
00:47:16,901 --> 00:47:20,900
Rym: You're projecting a lot of your thinking onto other people who might collect for other reasons.

782
00:47:24,022 --> 00:47:28,839
Scott: If you're collecting and you aren't opening a museum and you're not playing...

783
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,364
Rym: Whatever, Scott.

784
00:47:30,385 --> 00:47:32,095
Rym: I think your stance on this is kind of sad.

785
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:33,920
Scott: Collecting is not cool.

786
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:34,619
Rym: Whatever.

787
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:37,140
Scott: Collecting is obsessive compulsive and stupid.

788
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:39,960
Rym: I disagree with you pretty much almost all the way.

789
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:46,900
Rym: The only collecting I think is kind of dumb are people who collect for a profit because there's so much better ways to invest your money.

790
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:47,743
Rym: And you know what?

791
00:47:48,204 --> 00:47:52,137
Rym: I can't give you a specific example, but I work on Wall Street.

792
00:47:52,217 --> 00:47:52,498
Rym: I know.

793
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:56,020
Rym: There are better ways to invest your money than collecting crap.

794
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:58,860
Scott: Yeah, collecting stuff is not a good investment.

795
00:47:59,441 --> 00:48:03,560
Rym: But there's nothing wrong with collecting something because you think it's cool and then showing it off to people.

796
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:09,380
Rym: Like, check out my collection of old Atari games or check out my collection of these old ass records.

797
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:10,191
Rym: Look at these things.

798
00:48:10,231 --> 00:48:10,700
Rym: They're ancient.

799
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:13,240
Scott: Well, I mean, if you're going to sit around listening to records, it's cool.

800
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:14,819
Scott: If you just have records on the wall...

801
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:17,159
Rym: If you can't listen to those records, you'll destroy them.

802
00:48:18,285 --> 00:48:18,386
Scott: No.

803
00:48:18,427 --> 00:48:19,419
Scott: What's the point of having them?

804
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:21,120
Rym: A historical artifact?

805
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:22,466
Scott: Then put it in a museum.

806
00:48:22,707 --> 00:48:23,754
Scott: if it's a historical artifact.

807
00:48:23,774 --> 00:48:24,700
Scott: Why are you keeping it in your house?

808
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:25,363
Rym: Why not?

809
00:48:25,504 --> 00:48:28,220
Rym: The museum probably... One, the museum might not even care.

810
00:48:28,321 --> 00:48:29,120
Scott: Or start a museum.

811
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:31,940
Rym: That's beyond the resources of most people.

812
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:33,220
Scott: You can just turn your house into a museum.

813
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:37,340
Rym: I think your stance is really, really silly and I think you protect way too much.

814
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:40,880
Scott: People who are collecting are getting enjoyment from the owning of things.

815
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:41,205
Scott: So?

816
00:48:42,281 --> 00:48:46,260
Scott: That's the definition of, like, consumerism and materialism and everything that's wrong with the world.

817
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:47,022
Rym: Actually, no.

818
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:48,731
Rym: It's not the definition of consumerism.

819
00:48:48,771 --> 00:48:50,560
Rym: It's only the definition of materialism.

820
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:51,339
Scott: It's the same shit.

821
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:52,999
Rym: There's not that... Okay.

822
00:48:53,842 --> 00:48:58,220
Scott: It's the same thing within people's psyche that gives them enjoyment from getting things and continuing to own things.

823
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:01,640
Rym: Do you have anything else to say other than bitching about people collecting things?

824
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:07,280
Scott: I hate people collecting things and I hate it even more when they put them in boxes so they can never be played or read.

825
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:08,999
Rym: You bring this up all the time.

826
00:49:09,266 --> 00:49:09,413
Scott: Yeah.

827
00:49:09,762 --> 00:49:11,160
Rym: I disagree with you and I don't care.

828
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:12,018
Scott: Yeah, you're stupid.

829
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,980
Rym: Alright, so talk about something else.

830
00:49:14,462 --> 00:49:15,739
Scott: Alright, let's see what else we got here.

831
00:49:16,002 --> 00:49:16,818
Rym: This is all you now.

832
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:18,313
Scott: Oh, it's all me now all of a sudden?

833
00:49:18,353 --> 00:49:18,959
Scott: Why, you giving up?

834
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:21,660
Rym: Well, no, it's just why you turned into a crazy rat.

835
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:24,048
Scott: Yeah, 'cause I had to bring that crazy rat back.

836
00:49:24,068 --> 00:49:27,020
Scott: I've only done it once before and I think it's been getting worse lately.

837
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,780
Rym: Once before, you brought this up like a dozen times.

838
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:37,740
Scott: No, I've only really gone full on of it once before and I gotta bring it back again because they're putting video games in sealable boxes that can never be played now.

839
00:49:37,861 --> 00:49:38,585
Scott: What the fuck?

840
00:49:39,088 --> 00:49:39,753
Scott: What the fuck?

841
00:49:39,813 --> 00:49:40,799
Scott: I mean, come on.

842
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:41,317
Rym: Okay.

843
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:42,264
Scott: That's not cool.

844
00:49:42,285 --> 00:49:44,360
Scott: Alright.

845
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:44,871
Scott: Alright.

846
00:49:45,501 --> 00:49:45,651
Scott: Alright.

847
00:49:47,341 --> 00:49:48,900
Rym: I got nothing to say after your crazy rant.

848
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,525
Scott: You got nothing to say after my crazy rant?

849
00:49:50,545 --> 00:49:52,613
Scott: You don't wanna pick like a different forum thing here?

850
00:49:52,653 --> 00:49:54,320
Scott: That was your idea to go through the forums?

851
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:55,960
Rym: Yeah, no, we bought a vacuum cleaner.

852
00:49:56,421 --> 00:49:57,580
Scott: Oh, you wanna talk about the vacuum cleaner?

853
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:58,160
Rym: We could.

854
00:49:58,481 --> 00:49:58,653
Rym: Alright.

855
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,652
Rym: I don't think we need to matter everything we talk about.

856
00:50:00,672 --> 00:50:01,276
Rym: You wanna talk about this?

857
00:50:01,296 --> 00:50:01,860
Rym: Let's talk about this.

858
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:02,283
Scott: No.

859
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:03,687
Rym: Well, we bought a vacuum cleaner.

860
00:50:03,707 --> 00:50:05,540
Rym: We bought a normal cheapo vacuum cleaner.

861
00:50:05,722 --> 00:50:06,185
Scott: It wasn't that.

862
00:50:06,206 --> 00:50:07,174
Scott: It was relatively cheap.

863
00:50:07,274 --> 00:50:08,120
Scott: It was $2.50.

864
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:08,699
Rym: That's pretty cheap.

865
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:10,588
Scott: I think it'll last us quite a while.

866
00:50:10,628 --> 00:50:13,140
Scott: You know, if it only lasts us like a few years, it'll be pretty sad.

867
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:19,579
Scott: But, yeah, basically I went with the canister instead of the upright because it's easier to clean the stairs.

868
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,340
Rym: The thing is, that's the only thing that's easier to clean, sadly.

869
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:27,253
Scott: Well, it's also lighter because you don't have to move the whole vacuum, right, when you're vacuuming.

870
00:50:27,273 --> 00:50:29,940
Scott: So you only have to move around the accessory part, really.

871
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:30,213
Scott: Oh, yeah.

872
00:50:30,581 --> 00:50:32,040
Scott: It's a lot easier on the arms.

873
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:32,581
Rym: For now.

874
00:50:32,741 --> 00:50:33,763
Rym: Well, that's just because you're weak.

875
00:50:33,863 --> 00:50:35,326
Rym: But there is one problem.

876
00:50:35,386 --> 00:50:43,220
Rym: If we get a much bigger house, if we have any house with large carpeted rooms, a push vacuum is much easier and you can vacuum a lot faster.

877
00:50:43,901 --> 00:50:44,703
Scott: Oh, yeah, kind of.

878
00:50:44,763 --> 00:50:49,554
Scott: But if I have a large carpeted room, the Roomba is the way to go suddenly.

879
00:50:49,814 --> 00:50:52,160
Scott: You know, as long as there aren't a lot of obstacles in the room.

880
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:58,832
Rym: Actually, actually, I've read that the Roombas aren't, they're great from a vacuuming perspective in terms of they do it for you.

881
00:50:58,852 --> 00:51:02,478
Rym: But at the same time, they don't do that good a job of vacuuming.

882
00:51:02,498 --> 00:51:03,640
Rym: They don't have quite the suction.

883
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:08,955
Scott: Well, it doesn't matter if they don't have quite the suction because it vacuums around like every day or two, right?

884
00:51:09,276 --> 00:51:10,380
Scott: It's like constantly vacuuming.

885
00:51:11,041 --> 00:51:12,439
Rym: Yeah, but there's a lot of stuff that leaves.

886
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:13,699
Scott: That's just as good as vacuuming.

887
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:29,180
Rym: One thing, while Kirby vacuums are crap, the guy did a nice demo where you show different levels of suction, different kinds of vacuums and pretty much stuff that isn't picked up by one level of suction will never be picked up, no matter how many times you vacuum at that level.

888
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:33,217
Scott: Yeah, but I'm sure if you had a Roomba, your room wouldn't be, it wouldn't be dirty.

889
00:51:33,358 --> 00:51:33,720
Scott: It would be fine.

890
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:36,671
Rym: I wouldn't be dirty, but I don't think I'd get a Roomba.

891
00:51:36,952 --> 00:51:38,960
Rym: It takes so little time to vacuum.

892
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,808
Scott: Yeah, yeah, but I guess I don't have time to vacuum often enough.

893
00:51:42,848 --> 00:51:47,900
Scott: It's like two vacuum doesn't take long, but I don't actually vacuum like, you know, every week.

894
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:50,180
Rym: The only reason you don't vacuum is because there's always stuff all over the floor.

895
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:50,983
Scott: That too.

896
00:51:51,506 --> 00:51:53,359
Scott: I guess that would hurt the Roomba, wouldn't it?

897
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:57,340
Rym: Yeah, the only reason you don't vacuum is the same reason the Roomba won't vacuum.

898
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:09,675
Scott: Yeah, but I mean, at the, at the store, at the Sears, right where they had the vacuums, first of all, I got to tell you, if you buy a vacuum or something at Sears that's, you know, light enough to carry, don't bother with the like, you know, front of the store.

899
00:52:09,715 --> 00:52:10,536
Scott: pickup bullshit.

900
00:52:10,656 --> 00:52:13,740
Scott: It's much slower than actually just carrying the thing out of the store yourself.

901
00:52:14,021 --> 00:52:19,794
Rym: Man, I remember as a kid going to service merchandise, which is kind of, I don't know if they still exist, but they were a store kind of like Sears.

902
00:52:19,814 --> 00:52:22,420
Rym: You could buy pretty much any consumer item.

903
00:52:22,662 --> 00:52:23,298
Scott: Yeah, I've heard of them.

904
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:30,700
Rym: But the deal was anything on the floor, you pick up a ticket, then you put the ticket into the front, and then they bring you all your stuff.

905
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:33,720
Scott: Sort of like buying NES games at Toys R Us back in the day.

906
00:52:34,184 --> 00:52:34,494
Rym: Oh, man.

907
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:44,000
Scott: You take a piece of paper to like the magic box, and then the guy in the magic box, he would bring the game out to you, and it was crazy because there was like every Nintendo game in the universe in this box.

908
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:51,002
Rym: So I'd stand there for four hours with my brother, I remember very clearly, do we buy Mario 3 or Zelda 2?

909
00:52:51,002 --> 00:52:51,997
Rym: Yeah, we had those.

910
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:54,720
Rym: We had Zelda 2, and my brother wanted to buy Mario 3.

911
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:55,320
Scott: Your brother is smarter.

912
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,900
Rym: And they were both $65.

913
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:58,006
Scott: Yeah.

914
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,826
Rym: And I remember my dad was like, "Just

915
00:53:00,866 --> 00:53:01,167
Rym: pick!".

916
00:53:01,568 --> 00:53:06,240
Rym: And I think what we were hoping is that he would give up and buy both, just so we could go home.

917
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:10,340
Rym: But no, he was willing to stand there for four hours until we had to pick one.

918
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:14,775
Scott: Yeah, kids these days, they don't have the dilemma of picking NES games at Toys R Us.

919
00:53:14,836 --> 00:53:15,920
Scott: Those are good times.

920
00:53:16,841 --> 00:53:19,220
Rym: Yeah, well kids just get every video game they want, I guess.

921
00:53:19,526 --> 00:53:19,797
Scott: I don't know.

922
00:53:20,002 --> 00:53:20,899
Rym: It seems to be what happens.

923
00:53:21,101 --> 00:53:22,029
Scott: I don't know how it goes.

924
00:53:22,049 --> 00:53:22,957
Scott: I don't know.

925
00:53:23,686 --> 00:53:24,220
Rym: Well, it's weird.

926
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:27,340
Scott: It's also easier to pick nowadays because there's a lot more information out there.

927
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:31,840
Scott: We had to judge a lot by the covers of games and what games our friends had.

928
00:53:32,402 --> 00:53:33,539
Rym: I bought Hydlide from New.

929
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:34,979
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

930
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,260
Rym: Because that game looked awesome from the cover.

931
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:37,340
Scott: That wouldn't happen nowadays.

932
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:39,194
Rym: Or Nobunga's Ambition and Dr.

933
00:53:39,396 --> 00:53:39,880
Rym: Chayos.

934
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:40,483
Scott: Dr.

935
00:53:40,563 --> 00:53:41,673
Scott: Chayos, I played Dr.

936
00:53:41,693 --> 00:53:42,500
Scott: Chayos at a friend's house.

937
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:50,820
Rym: But I'm going through the forum, you can kind of tell who succeeds and who fails at making threads because it's like one thread has three comments.

938
00:53:51,185 --> 00:53:52,080
Rym: One thread has one.

939
00:53:52,481 --> 00:53:53,860
Rym: One thread has a thousand.

940
00:53:55,641 --> 00:54:00,080
Rym: Though I got to admit, this is definitely a meta-forum thing that non-forum people won't care about.

941
00:54:00,922 --> 00:54:05,500
Rym: But, alright Lord Yupa, you don't need to make a million super generic threads.

942
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:06,598
Rym: You can let that be.

943
00:54:07,346 --> 00:54:07,559
Scott: Yeah.

944
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:10,860
Rym: You're better off posting in an existing thread than making a new thread.

945
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:13,500
Rym: That's a general kind of advice to all of you out there.

946
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:18,480
Scott: Yeah, I think that's true on pretty much every web forums and news group and such.

947
00:54:19,905 --> 00:54:20,798
Scott: Anything else going on?

948
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:21,747
Rym: I don't know.

949
00:54:21,808 --> 00:54:22,900
Rym: I feel like we're winding down.

950
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,300
Rym: I feel my hunger rising.

951
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:25,224
Rym: I'm going back.

952
00:54:25,264 --> 00:54:27,480
Rym: I'm trying to find some old ass thread.

953
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:31,780
Scott: There's a thread about the shaving has sort of come back.

954
00:54:32,583 --> 00:54:34,660
Scott: One of our earliest episodes was about shaving.

955
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:36,260
Rym: I think Emily was even on that episode.

956
00:54:36,621 --> 00:54:37,060
Scott: I don't remember.

957
00:54:37,561 --> 00:54:39,480
Rym: Because I think the title was Emily and Shaving.

958
00:54:41,041 --> 00:54:46,460
Scott: We talked about using the multi-blade Gillette bullshit.

959
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:49,740
Scott: It sucks and you should use a brush and do it the real deal way.

960
00:54:50,181 --> 00:54:51,880
Scott: I think people need to be reminded of that.

961
00:54:53,022 --> 00:54:56,580
Scott: Should we redo the episode or should we just tell people to go back and listen to it or what?

962
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:58,700
Rym: Maybe we should do it as a news bit or a front bit.

963
00:54:58,942 --> 00:55:00,335
Scott: I think we'll do a shaving video.

964
00:55:00,375 --> 00:55:00,819
Scott: is what we'll do.

965
00:55:01,966 --> 00:55:03,320
Rym: Ah, I can do the video on how to shave.

966
00:55:04,184 --> 00:55:05,620
Scott: I think I'll do the video on how to shave.

967
00:55:06,401 --> 00:55:09,420
Rym: Well, I think you should film it and I'll be the one doing the shaving.

968
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:12,640
Scott: I think I'll be doing the shaving and I'll just have the camera sitting there on a tripod.

969
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,239
Rym: That'll be awful, but that's all you.

970
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:14,960
Rym: That's alright.

971
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:18,160
Scott: Maybe we should make Scott versus Rym shaving battle.

972
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,540
Rym: I think I can make a better shaving.

973
00:55:20,125 --> 00:55:20,999
Scott: I don't know about that.

974
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:22,490
Rym: Because I do the proper technique.

975
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:23,880
Rym: I do the full three passes.

976
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:25,528
Scott: Yeah, whatever.

977
00:55:25,872 --> 00:55:26,560
Scott: You and your bullshit.

978
00:55:27,484 --> 00:55:28,559
Rym: My face is real smooth.

979
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:29,320
Scott: Yeah, whatever.

980
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:30,779
Rym: Plus, unlike you, I shave every day.

981
00:55:31,062 --> 00:55:32,060
Scott: Yeah, it's not necessary.

982
00:55:32,341 --> 00:55:33,799
Rym: It's very much necessary with me.

983
00:55:34,265 --> 00:55:34,819
Rym: Yes, it is.

984
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:35,326
Scott: No, it's not.

985
00:55:35,795 --> 00:55:36,020
Rym: Anyway.

986
00:55:37,063 --> 00:55:40,480
Rym: The thing is, you always look like you have this horrible stubble that never goes away.

987
00:55:40,721 --> 00:55:42,900
Scott: Even if I shave, it doesn't go away, so what is the point?

988
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:44,680
Rym: It would go away if you did the three passes.

989
00:55:45,021 --> 00:55:45,820
Scott: No, I'm not doing no passes.

990
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:46,578
Rym: Have you ever done them?

991
00:55:46,781 --> 00:55:47,800
Scott: I'll get some ingrown hairs.

992
00:55:48,161 --> 00:55:49,860
Rym: Alright, you got the Jew face problem.

993
00:55:51,226 --> 00:55:51,859
Scott: I can't shave up.

994
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:53,139
Rym: Because Greg had the same problem.

995
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:59,140
Rym: It seems like if you have a certain kind of hair, you're kind of screwed in that you can only do the downward pass.

996
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:03,900
Rym: Because if you do the back pass and the side pass, every single hair will ingrow and you're just screwed.

997
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:04,410
Scott: Yep.

998
00:56:04,881 --> 00:56:06,139
Rym: So yeah, I guess I can't blame you then.

999
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:12,239
Rym: So I guess you can do the shaving for people with the Jew face, and I can do... Well, it's not just Jews.

1000
00:56:12,981 --> 00:56:13,442
Rym: It's common.

1001
00:56:13,463 --> 00:56:18,280
Rym: We used to joke about the Jew face, but African Americans have a similar problem with shaving sometimes.

1002
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:24,691
Scott: Anyone with sort of really thick, sort of pointy hairs, as opposed to like...

1003
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:33,540
Rym: Yeah, I have the really fat hairs that just kind of pop out no matter what.

1004
00:56:34,041 --> 00:56:34,984
Scott: The kind of beard.

1005
00:56:35,024 --> 00:56:39,980
Scott: that's like more flowing would be more of a non-ingrown hair.

1006
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:44,240
Rym: Curly hair really hurts too, but I just swang back to the bottom of the forum.

1007
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:48,360
Rym: And the bottom post here is so old.

1008
00:56:49,624 --> 00:56:50,719
Rym: I'll end on this, I think.

1009
00:56:51,481 --> 00:56:53,699
Rym: This is way back when we put in this new forum.

1010
00:56:54,600 --> 00:57:01,220
Rym: And K-Mac, who is a friend of ours, who has a different name now, posted a thread, probably to post a thread.

1011
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:05,360
Rym: "Shaney under attack and biting back," and it was just a thread about Dick Cheney.

1012
00:57:07,782 --> 00:57:11,837
Rym: And Scott responded with, "Alright, you people need to have your own blogs instead of posting this stuff

1013
00:57:11,877 --> 00:57:12,018
Rym: here.".

1014
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:13,999
Scott: Yeah, that's true.

1015
00:57:14,862 --> 00:57:18,679
Scott: I do notice that in pretty much any forum you go to, right?

1016
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:22,160
Scott: There will be people in those forums who don't have their own websites.

1017
00:57:23,341 --> 00:57:28,280
Scott: It's sort of like the forum is the only place they really create any content online.

1018
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,880
Scott: It's like they're not big online, they're just sort of small fries.

1019
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:34,200
Scott: But they'll be a member of a forum and they'll post once in a while.

1020
00:57:35,683 --> 00:57:39,200
Scott: So that's their only really outlet for anything on the net.

1021
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:57,980
Scott: So when they have something to say, whether it's really long or really short, or if it's just a link, or maybe something they made, they always post it in the forum and it's sort of like, you gotta be able to tell when something is appropriate for a forum post and when something is, you should post that on your own blog.

1022
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:06,440
Rym: Well, I think it's a sign of, I don't know, I would look at it in the scale of internet, not necessarily affection, but the pecking order.

1023
00:58:07,361 --> 00:58:10,820
Rym: I'll say it's pretty much subconscious or conscious or whatever.

1024
00:58:11,483 --> 00:58:15,380
Rym: I think there's kind of like, there are people who have the websites that they run them.

1025
00:58:15,783 --> 00:58:17,017
Rym: Like, I have a blog and I posted it.

1026
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:21,479
Rym: And then there are people who have the blog that other people comment on, that's like higher up.

1027
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:25,000
Rym: And then going down, there's the people who don't even have a blog.

1028
00:58:25,381 --> 00:58:28,600
Rym: Instead, they put their content in someone else's blog.

1029
00:58:28,921 --> 00:58:32,700
Rym: And that's kind of like the wolf baring its neck to the person who runs that blog.

1030
00:58:33,624 --> 00:58:34,398
Scott: It's not like that.

1031
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:35,361
Rym: Yeah.

1032
00:58:35,743 --> 00:58:38,639
Rym: Then, there's a thread here.

1033
00:58:38,941 --> 00:58:42,480
Scott: Just so everyone knows, blogs are free and you don't even need to pay for them.

1034
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:49,040
Scott: You sign up and you've got one, like at wordpress.com or blog or spot or any of those, live journal.

1035
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:53,600
Scott: So, there's no excuse not to have one if you want to post essays or whatever.

1036
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:56,760
Rym: So, remember episode 12, How To Not Suck?

1037
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:57,929
Scott: Was that the first?

1038
00:58:57,970 --> 00:58:58,620
Scott: How To Not Suck?

1039
00:58:58,761 --> 00:59:00,239
Rym: It was just How To Not Suck.

1040
00:59:00,882 --> 00:59:01,479
Scott: Was it really?

1041
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:01,849
Scott: Yeah.

1042
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:02,244
Scott: Wow.

1043
00:59:03,062 --> 00:59:06,836
Rym: And you were asking like, "So, what do you think of How To Not Suck

1044
00:59:07,057 --> 00:59:07,398
Rym: Schtick?".

1045
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:08,700
Rym: There's a tongue twister.

1046
00:59:09,805 --> 00:59:10,580
Rym: And people thought it was good.

1047
00:59:10,961 --> 00:59:11,111
Scott: Alright.

1048
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:12,539
Rym: People, one person.

1049
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,400
Scott: That could be one of our Thursdays.

1050
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:17,120
Scott: We could bring back the How To Not Suck Thursday and the Fables Thursday.

1051
00:59:17,622 --> 00:59:18,148
Rym: Maybe we should.

1052
00:59:18,189 --> 00:59:19,180
Rym: How To Not Suck was good.

1053
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:22,879
Scott: The thing is we need more things of what not to suck at.

1054
00:59:23,525 --> 00:59:24,599
Scott: So, help us out.

1055
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:27,100
Rym: Wow, Ken hasn't posted in the forum in a long time.

1056
00:59:27,402 --> 00:59:27,576
Scott: Nope.

1057
00:59:28,601 --> 00:59:29,451
Rym: Oh, wow, Moyterer.

1058
00:59:29,471 --> 00:59:30,240
Rym: I remember that game.

1059
00:59:30,604 --> 00:59:31,979
Scott: Yeah, well, that game's not bad.

1060
00:59:33,404 --> 00:59:34,820
Rym: We only really played it three player.

1061
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,620
Scott: Yeah, the four players as far as the period.

1062
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,760
Scott: The Farader game, I think, really needs more play.

1063
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:41,660
Rym: But the Farader was, I don't know.

1064
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:47,640
Scott: I think we just didn't give it, you didn't give enough of a shot because- Well, because we also played that three player and it was garbage three player.

1065
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:51,180
Scott: Yeah, well, but Farader has the great sort of trader mechanic.

1066
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:57,800
Scott: It's really all about tradering and we didn't get that, you know, the main core aspect of the game was not exposed.

1067
00:59:57,820 --> 01:00:04,280
Rym: Well, I think Moyterer's problem was just that it's so card based that it ends up being random and you don't have any options as your strategy.

1068
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:07,540
Scott: Well, I think it was that we sort of figured out the optimal strategy.

1069
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:13,319
Scott: But Farader, I don't think there is an optimal strategy because a little bit of psychology is going on with tradering and not tradering.

1070
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:15,519
Rym: We had an episode called the crap episode.

1071
01:00:16,188 --> 01:00:16,457
Scott: Did we?

1072
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:19,680
Scott: Yes, there was- Did we talk about poop or was it just a bad episode?

1073
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:21,620
Rym: There wasn't so much for us to talk about today.

1074
01:00:22,123 --> 01:00:23,620
Rym: And with the Daily Show, that's expected.

1075
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:24,667
Rym: What do we do?

1076
01:00:24,990 --> 01:00:25,292
Rym: Is there a?

1077
01:00:25,373 --> 01:00:25,939
Rym: what should we do?

1078
01:00:26,884 --> 01:00:27,680
Rym: Wow, that was crap.

1079
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:30,140
Scott: Yeah, there's a lot of bad ones in there.

1080
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:33,300
Scott: I mean, that's going to happen when you do so many episodes.

1081
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:34,659
Scott: Some of them are going to suck like this one.

1082
01:00:35,146 --> 01:00:35,700
Rym: I think we're done.

1083
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:36,159
Scott: We're done.

1084
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:45,100
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1085
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,680
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music.

1086

1087
01:01:00,203 --> 01:01:05,799
Rym: We say feeds plural because GeekNights airs four nights a week covering four different brands of geekery.

1088
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:07,919
Rym: Mondays are science and technology.

1089
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:10,520
Rym: Tuesdays we have video games, board games, and RPGs.

1090
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:13,140
Rym: Wednesdays are anime, manga, comic nights.

1091
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:16,419
Rym: And Thursdays are the catch-alls for various rants and tomfoolery.

1092
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:24,979
Scott: You can send us feedback by email to geeknights@frontroadcrew.com or you can send audio feedback via Odeo.

1094

1098
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:54,840
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1099
01:01:55,282 --> 01:01:58,380
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
