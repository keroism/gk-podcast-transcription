1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,156
Scott: It's Tuesday February 13th.

2
00:00:12,861 --> 00:00:15,519
Scott: I'm Scott and I'm Rym and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:16,403 --> 00:00:20,459
Scott: Tonight we review the awesome board game turn and Texas.

4
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:30,707
Rym: Let's do this So while we're sitting here in the geek house recording in the studio You'll be pleased to know that outside.

5
00:00:30,987 --> 00:00:34,457
Rym: There is currently a quivering maelstrom of snow.

6
00:00:34,477 --> 00:00:35,660
Scott: Did it actually start snowing yet?

7
00:00:35,882 --> 00:00:37,540
Rym: It's been snowing for the last hour and a half.

8
00:00:37,622 --> 00:00:38,420
Scott: Oh, I haven't looked at it.

9
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:43,900
Scott: Like I had my window open so I would see the snow start but I guess I haven't looked out the window when it started.

10
00:00:44,203 --> 00:00:50,620
Rym: In fact after we hit that salad I looked out the window like as I was finishing up and I said hey, I don't think it started snowing yet.

11
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:54,272
Rym: Then I looked and I thought oh it in fact just started snowing.

12
00:00:54,313 --> 00:01:02,380
Scott: Yeah, you know when you live across from a car dealer It's actually pretty useful because when there's gonna be a crazy storm they move all the cars into an optimal configuration.

13
00:01:03,261 --> 00:01:05,009
Rym: Yep, the thing is I had no idea.

14
00:01:05,029 --> 00:01:06,033
Rym: there was bad weather coming.

15
00:01:06,093 --> 00:01:13,657
Rym: I'm at work, you know doing my work stuff I'm planning on leaving and then someone all day people keep making references to like man.

16
00:01:13,718 --> 00:01:14,480
Rym: Is it gonna snow?

17
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:17,659
Rym: I don't know something about snow snow snow snow.

18
00:01:17,981 --> 00:01:19,126
Rym: But no one said outright.

19
00:01:19,387 --> 00:01:22,600
Rym: the weather said it's gonna snow and I don't like to make small talk.

20
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:27,356
Rym: So I blew these people off and ignored them and it didn't look like it was gonna snow.

21
00:01:27,396 --> 00:01:28,540
Rym: In fact, it was really warm.

22
00:01:29,023 --> 00:01:30,653
Rym: I took a short nap in my car.

23
00:01:30,713 --> 00:01:31,760
Scott: It was pretty warm today.

24
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,940
Scott: I mean I drove to the dentist that I found out about the snow from the dentist's office.

25
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:38,149
Rym: Oh, yeah, cuz they always get small talk at the dentist.

26
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:48,340
Rym: Yeah, I know instead of taking lunch I just took a nap in my car for the half hour 45 minutes or so and I was plenty warm without running the car or anything.

27
00:01:48,822 --> 00:01:50,470
Rym: Yeah, and it was nice and you whatever.

28
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:55,450
Rym: and then just as I'm about to leave work I look outside and suddenly it's really gray out.

29
00:01:55,491 --> 00:01:57,919
Scott: It was super gray most of the day here.

30
00:01:58,361 --> 00:02:03,460
Rym: So I go on to you know, no a dot gov and it says horrible snow next couple.

31
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,836
Scott: Yeah, they're big red letters whenever something's written in red.

32
00:02:05,856 --> 00:02:06,319
Scott: That's bad.

33
00:02:07,084 --> 00:02:10,100
Rym: So then I'm like, alright horrible snow in yawkers and then I check beacon.

34
00:02:10,321 --> 00:02:11,564
Rym: Oh horrible snow and beacon.

35
00:02:12,126 --> 00:02:15,475
Rym: and then I check DC because now I'm worried about driving to Katsu.

36
00:02:15,515 --> 00:02:16,919
Scott: Come here now more at the snow.

37
00:02:17,341 --> 00:02:17,743
Scott: I don't mind.

38
00:02:17,783 --> 00:02:22,180
Scott: if it snows tomorrow if it stays shitty bad on Thursday, that's gonna suck.

39
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,413
Scott: We're gonna have to drive to DC really slowly.

40
00:02:24,454 --> 00:02:25,500
Rym: thing is we're not leaving.

41
00:02:25,821 --> 00:02:28,071
Scott: It can't be as bad as the drive home from uber con.

42
00:02:28,432 --> 00:02:30,320
Rym: god, we should tell that story.

43
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:32,120
Scott: Did we tell this time we told the story?

44
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:32,742
Rym: I don't know.

45
00:02:32,762 --> 00:02:37,040
Scott: maybe someone go and see if we've ever done a podcast about the drive back from uber con.

46
00:02:37,281 --> 00:02:39,211
Rym: Yeah, cuz we need a special for this Thursday.

47
00:02:39,251 --> 00:02:40,920
Rym: Anyway, if we haven't done it, we'll tell that story.

48
00:02:41,221 --> 00:02:47,248
Rym: That sounds good, especially since we are going this weekend to Katsucon Which is famous for what?

49
00:02:47,308 --> 00:02:48,875
Rym: three four five years.

50
00:02:48,895 --> 00:02:51,305
Rym: I forget how many years ago was Katsucon.

51
00:02:51,445 --> 00:02:54,979
Rym: it was the year before I went so it's three years ago got snowed in.

52
00:02:55,961 --> 00:02:58,857
Scott: Getting snowed into a convention can either be awesome or terrible.

53
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:06,244
Scott: now I if I was a convention and we I got snowed in I would just keep it rolling at least the parts that didn't need me Planning.

54
00:03:06,264 --> 00:03:07,900
Scott: I mean, he's a video game open.

55
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,221
Scott: Why not?

56
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:17,994
Rym: from what I heard a lot of the people who went it sucked for them because they you know Most people can't deal with having to take extra days out of your life suddenly.

57
00:03:18,014 --> 00:03:20,280
Scott: Yeah, that does kind of something colony work.

58
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,608
Scott: I'm just lucky in that right now.

59
00:03:21,648 --> 00:03:23,440
Scott: I'm in a situation right off to work until March.

60
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:29,907
Rym: But imagine after they call a job you're like, hey, yeah, I'm down in Washington DC Snowed into a hotel.

61
00:03:30,027 --> 00:03:32,100
Rym: I can't come back until Wednesday.

62
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:38,892
Scott: Yeah, maybe that's pretty bad But you know when stuff like that happens, it's beyond your control.

63
00:03:39,394 --> 00:03:40,699
Scott: Just accept it and deal with it.

64
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,292
Scott: Yeah, that's the best way to get through with the least suffering.

65
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,900
Scott: Let's just sit there worrying about it.

66
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:47,812
Scott: It's gonna be a long two days of trapped in the hotel.

67
00:03:47,913 --> 00:03:49,057
Rym: Well, that's kind of people we are.

68
00:03:49,098 --> 00:03:51,660
Rym: but also Remember we have money.

69
00:03:52,022 --> 00:03:55,580
Rym: So whenever something like that happens we are immediately prepared to deal with it.

70
00:03:55,801 --> 00:03:58,940
Rym: The credit card can always get us out of any situation like that.

71
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:05,300
Scott: That's why you know Penn Jillette always has that thing where he won't go anywhere if he can't save his ass with money.

72
00:04:05,542 --> 00:04:07,219
Scott: It's like in the middle of the jungle in Africa.

73
00:04:07,676 --> 00:04:15,303
Scott: No even if you're carrying all of Bill Gates fortune in a briefcase that won't save you if like a snake bites you or a Guerrilla attacks you.

74
00:04:15,724 --> 00:04:16,546
Scott: so he won't go there.

75
00:04:16,927 --> 00:04:21,700
Scott: He only goes places where money can save his ass no matter what happens.

76
00:04:22,182 --> 00:04:23,288
Rym: Yes, I think is a good plan.

77
00:04:23,308 --> 00:04:25,639
Rym: He also steals cars, but you know, that's not.

78
00:04:27,742 --> 00:04:33,660
Scott: Yep, hopefully this bad weather will not affect our Katsucon plan and hopefully you will get to Katsucon despite weather.

79
00:04:34,142 --> 00:04:37,900
Rym: Yes, Katsucon is this weekend in Washington DC at the Omni Shoreham Hotel.

80
00:04:38,101 --> 00:04:40,916
Rym: You can find out all the information at I believe Katsucon.com.

81
00:04:42,201 --> 00:04:46,191
Scott: Go to Google and type in K A T S U C O N.

82
00:04:46,332 --> 00:04:49,460
Rym: Yes as in our friend katsu and then khan all one word.

83
00:04:49,741 --> 00:04:49,963
Scott: Yes.

84
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:52,980
Rym: Yeah, we're gonna be staff in the video game room.

85
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:58,236
Rym: We're gonna be doing all sorts of crazy stuff live shows various tournaments anime match game.

86
00:04:58,356 --> 00:05:00,101
Rym: It's gonna be awesome way Awesome.

87
00:05:00,403 --> 00:05:05,059
Rym: Also, we're gonna have our DS's and we just got Diddy Kong Racings and we'll probably want to play that a little bit.

88
00:05:05,561 --> 00:05:06,724
Scott: Yep Diddy Kong Racing.

89
00:05:07,646 --> 00:05:13,320
Scott: it didn't meet my original expectations, but it beat my secondary very much lowered expectations.

90
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,951
Scott: So we'll talk about that in a couple weeks probably.

91
00:05:16,092 --> 00:05:17,779
Rym: Yep, but a lot of gaming a lot of fun.

92
00:05:18,643 --> 00:05:23,340
Rym: We'll have some things to give away but not things that any of you will probably want.

93
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,717
Rym: They're mostly things for people who don't listen to the show yet.

94
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:29,853
Scott: Yep Oh, and I think in the future of GeekNights, I don't want to.

95
00:05:29,933 --> 00:05:41,989
Scott: I don't want to be a hundred percent sure on this But there's a possibility that I might be acquiring something for free which I will give away that is worth Substantial but not incredibly large amounts of money.

96
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:42,772
Rym: Oh, really?

97
00:05:42,892 --> 00:05:43,574
Rym: Yep.

98
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:44,437
Rym: This is news to me.

99
00:05:44,698 --> 00:05:45,180
Scott: I know it is.

100
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:45,944
Scott: I forgot to tell you.

101
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:46,628
Rym: Well, what is it?

102
00:05:46,648 --> 00:05:47,372
Rym: Are you not gonna say

103
00:05:47,934 --> 00:06:02,409
Scott: I might as well just say it All right I'm probably gonna buy this laptop because you know I had to give my old one back to my job and it's going to come with a perfectly free Creative Zen 512 megabyte mp3 player and I don't need it.

104
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:05,880
Rym: We're gonna have to have one hell of a fucking contest for that.

105
00:06:06,022 --> 00:06:10,832
Scott: yeah, the other thing is if I The reason I'm buying this laptop is there's a chance that it.

106
00:06:10,993 --> 00:06:16,120
Scott: the only thing that could be wrong with it where I would be Dissatisfied would be if it's too slow and I was lucky.

107
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:24,427
Scott: I read the return the official return policy the fine print if I don't like it and I return it within 15 days Which I will do if it is too slow.

108
00:06:24,447 --> 00:06:26,735
Scott: I have to return the mp3 player.

109
00:06:26,775 --> 00:06:27,980
Scott: Also, we're all set to pay for it?

110
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,380
Rym: No, well in that case, we'll just give away my Carcassonne instead.

111
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,030
Scott: Yeah, we're gonna give that away no matter what.

112
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,458
Scott: we're gonna give that away katsukan.

113
00:06:34,963 --> 00:06:46,681
Rym: Yeah for that Carcassonne I was thinking about setting up a little booth in the video game room a little table kind of like those three card money guys That you see out on the street and really poor towns Ronnie and you know I'll just.

114
00:06:46,982 --> 00:06:55,600
Rym: you can come up and if you wish you can challenge me to a two-player game of Carcassonne and if you win I will give you a brand new unopened copy of Carcassonne.

115
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,520
Rym: But if you lose you have to buy me another copy of Carcassonne.

116
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,968
Scott: Yeah, we got that copy of Carcassonne real cheap.

117
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:03,853
Scott: So why not buy another one?

118
00:07:03,874 --> 00:07:04,375
Scott: Yeah.

119
00:07:04,736 --> 00:07:09,260
Rym: Hey, I don't know what we'll do But we'll give it away at some point either at the con or in the future.

120
00:07:09,641 --> 00:07:14,100
Rym: We'll probably bring a couple of board games to katsukan since we'll be in the gaming room, which is mostly video.

121
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,149
Scott: But I'm sure we might bring maybe third in taxes.

122
00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:18,071
Scott: Maybe something smaller.

123
00:07:18,452 --> 00:07:20,900
Scott: Who knows maybe Dracula for the night time.

124
00:07:21,502 --> 00:07:24,598
Rym: Ooh, that might be a good con game at night at night time.

125
00:07:24,638 --> 00:07:24,819
Scott: Hells.

126
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:29,440
Rym: Yeah That's the kind of game where you get in big enough crowd and some people would be happy just to hang around and watch.

127
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,529
Scott: Yeah, the thing is it takes a little bit too long.

128
00:07:31,971 --> 00:07:32,574
Scott: if it was shorter.

129
00:07:32,614 --> 00:07:33,519
Scott: You could really get it going.

130
00:07:33,881 --> 00:07:34,899
Scott: Maybe Scotland Yard, you know.

131
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,580
Rym: Yeah, well as long as one of us was Dracula and then one of us was teaching people as we went instead of team.

132
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,476
Rym: Yeah, we'll figure it out.

133
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:40,787
Scott: Yeah.

134
00:07:41,281 --> 00:07:50,290
Rym: Anyway in the news the virtual console has been as it is always doing having more and more games put on it in order to Trick Scott and I into spending money on games.

135
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:58,084
Rym: We already own in multiple copies And the three latest games are two Absolutely.

136
00:07:58,124 --> 00:07:59,513
Rym: Fantastic games though.

137
00:07:59,554 --> 00:08:05,855
Rym: That is a very Weighted statement and one game that is not worth five bucks, but it's definitely an important game.

138
00:08:06,016 --> 00:08:08,952
Rym: Yep ice climber I don't think I need to say anything about it.

139
00:08:09,053 --> 00:08:11,887
Rym: It's an old classic Nice climbers fun.

140
00:08:12,028 --> 00:08:14,060
Scott: It's a classic but it's not worth five bucks.

141
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,500
Scott: It's worth maybe one buck because it's a simple old game.

142
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:23,522
Rym: I'd wager that most people who play Nintendo systems today have never even seen ice climbers because this game is an old Game.

143
00:08:23,723 --> 00:08:24,668
Scott: it is real old.

144
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:25,251
Scott: it came out.

145
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:26,940
Scott: It was one of the first Nintendo releases.

146
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,088
Scott: It wasn't you know, the old style box and everything.

147
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:32,419
Rym: Yep ice climber was before the NES was really that popular.

148
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:39,408
Scott: Yeah, I put ice climber in there with say like Galaxian, you know, it's a great old game But it's so at such.

149
00:08:39,587 --> 00:08:44,346
Scott: it's so old and minimalist that it's not really worth paying for Pac-man on there.

150
00:08:44,387 --> 00:08:45,271
Scott: pac-man is great.

151
00:08:45,332 --> 00:08:46,116
Scott: I love pac-man.

152
00:08:46,217 --> 00:08:46,860
Scott: dig-dug is great.

153
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:51,939
Scott: I love dig-dug but not paying five bucks for it because it's so simple, you know, there's not much to it.

154
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,404
Rym: But I'll bet.

155
00:08:53,424 --> 00:08:57,841
Rym: the only reason anyone knows about this game is because they put the characters in the game Keeps.

156
00:08:57,941 --> 00:09:00,289
Scott: I knew about ice climbers way before we did.

157
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:03,880
Scott: because yeah, most people I imagine heard about the ice climbers.

158
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:10,540
Scott: So Smash Brothers Melee and perhaps some other games recently they've made appearances in because remember we don't know what game they're actually from.

159
00:09:10,781 --> 00:09:13,208
Rym: We were pretty much the forefront of the Nintendo generation.

160
00:09:13,248 --> 00:09:16,960
Rym: I grew up on Nintendo to the exclusion of all other activity.

161
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:27,385
Scott: So if you actually if you have extra money like you don't care and you have never played ice climbers That would be the only time I would recommend you pay five bucks for it or you know Emulate it because it's not worth.

162
00:09:27,465 --> 00:09:30,316
Scott: Yes on the yeah, if you can just emulate.

163
00:09:30,376 --> 00:09:34,920
Scott: once you've played it twice You'll be done playing it unless you want to master it which you might want to do.

164
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,366
Scott: No, you know that would be pretty impressive.

165
00:09:36,427 --> 00:09:37,853
Scott: Someone mastered ice climber?

166
00:09:38,295 --> 00:09:39,220
Scott: little ice climber speedrun.

167
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,310
Rym: It's not that hard to master ice climber.

168
00:09:41,531 --> 00:09:42,254
Scott: I don't know somebody.

169
00:09:42,576 --> 00:09:46,952
Scott: at the early levels I can just whip them out, but later levels get pretty tricky.

170
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,100
Rym: ice climber is easier than bubble bobble.

171
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:53,957
Rym: It is easier than bubble bob and I fucking beat bubble bobble all the way through is it?

172
00:09:53,997 --> 00:09:54,800
Scott: you're a crazy man?

173
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,208
Rym: Yeah, me and my brother played that game forever.

174
00:09:58,131 --> 00:10:00,720
Scott: I eventually just got tired of going through all those levels.

175
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,549
Rym: Oh, you know who does know about ice climbers?

176
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:03,594
Rym: Yeah, it is VG cats.

177
00:10:03,976 --> 00:10:04,619
Scott: Oh, does he really?

178
00:10:04,699 --> 00:10:06,549
Rym: yeah There was nice climber joke a while ago.

179
00:10:06,569 --> 00:10:07,976
Scott: One of the games came out.

180
00:10:08,037 --> 00:10:08,941
Scott: the two big ones All right.

181
00:10:08,981 --> 00:10:11,834
Rym: Well number one Kirby's adventure, which is probably the best Kirby game.

182
00:10:11,854 --> 00:10:15,969
Scott: Kirby's adventure is a game I had for the NES and I beat the hell out of that game.

183
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:19,240
Scott: I got every single secret a hundred percent completion.

184
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,806
Scott: I beat everything.

185
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:21,770
Scott: I got everything.

186
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:29,986
Scott: there was nothing left for me in that game and I did that on the NES The original release of this game and it is without a doubt the best Kirby game ever.

187
00:10:30,086 --> 00:10:33,520
Scott: every Kirby game that came after took from Kirby's adventure.

188
00:10:33,641 --> 00:10:38,140
Scott: I mean there was Kirby's dreamland, which is the original Kirby platform game for the Gameboy.

189
00:10:38,802 --> 00:10:44,420
Scott: But Kirby's adventure was really made Kirby, you know, he swallows something and then he gets a power.

190
00:10:44,681 --> 00:10:46,752
Scott: You couldn't get powers in Kirby's dreamland.

191
00:10:47,455 --> 00:10:52,215
Scott: only in Kirby's adventure Could you get powers from eating different guys and that's what made Kirby awesome.

192
00:10:52,315 --> 00:10:53,500
Rym: See I never owned Kirby's adventure.

193
00:10:53,581 --> 00:11:07,517
Rym: I rented it once I liked it I gave it back and ever bought it and I didn't really realize how great it actually was until when I was living alone in the mountains on co-op and I had nothing to entertain me, but Read or die TV that was already on my hard drive.

194
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:12,740
Rym: Oh gunslinger girls And a bunch of NES ROM.

195
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:17,620
Rym: so I started playing pretty much every NES ROM one by one as far as I could stand to.

196
00:11:18,162 --> 00:11:21,976
Rym: When I hit Kirby's adventure, I played through that entire game.

197
00:11:22,076 --> 00:11:23,180
Scott: Did you get all the secrets though?

198
00:11:23,441 --> 00:11:23,984
Rym: I think I did.

199
00:11:24,608 --> 00:11:27,224
Scott: there's a lot of them and they're really cool secrets I play.

200
00:11:27,245 --> 00:11:35,400
Scott: some of them are really tricky like this one level We have to swallow two fireball bad guys to get a hammer and then get somewhere without getting hit and then use it.

201
00:11:35,601 --> 00:11:36,747
Scott: It's all really good stuff.

202
00:11:36,928 --> 00:11:39,060
Rym: I played it every day for like three weeks.

203
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:42,589
Scott: Yeah the bosses are also really fun and of course is awesome.

204
00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:49,191
Rym: the last game that is on the virtual console a game that a Lot of people hate or had a lot of difficulty with it.

205
00:11:49,312 --> 00:11:59,634
Rym: Even I I had mad difficulty with it even though I like I never ever ever ever legitimately beat this game or In fact got past the second level without cheating.

206
00:11:59,714 --> 00:12:01,220
Scott: I never got past second level without cheating.

207
00:12:01,341 --> 00:12:04,380
Scott: I barely can get past the first level like if I tried to play it today.

208
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,008
Scott: I can't beat the first level most times.

209
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:11,130
Rym: kid Icarus, which I owned And sold and then bought again.

210
00:12:11,571 --> 00:12:12,334
Scott: my cousin owned it.

211
00:12:12,374 --> 00:12:13,318
Scott: I played it a few times.

212
00:12:13,338 --> 00:12:21,137
Scott: other than that I never really played it just because I was so hard at his house There was no way that I was gonna pay money for a game that I would never get anywhere in.

213
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:25,419
Rym: I mean kid Icarus is very similar to Metroid except it's a thousand times harder.

214
00:12:26,302 --> 00:12:28,974
Scott: And it's not doesn't have really the exploring of Metroid.

215
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:30,200
Scott: It's sort of like just go forth.

216
00:12:31,703 --> 00:12:32,770
Rym: It's two types of games.

217
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,260
Rym: remember you didn't play it far enough.

218
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,835
Rym: That is true because well there's three types of games.

219
00:12:37,076 --> 00:12:39,065
Rym: you start off And it's an up scrolling.

220
00:12:39,165 --> 00:12:42,879
Rym: if you fall down you die game platformer up scrolling platformer.

221
00:12:43,461 --> 00:12:46,450
Rym: Then it's a side scrolling platformer.

222
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:54,278
Rym: Yeah, and it's an up scrolling platformer again and Littered throughout are the labyrinths which are basically a Metroid.

223
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:59,574
Scott: yep And it's just there's also isn't there side-scrolling shooting later on on the very very end of the game.

224
00:12:59,674 --> 00:13:00,737
Rym: Yeah, it becomes a shmup.

225
00:13:01,179 --> 00:13:03,627
Scott: yep It's a lot of games in one.

226
00:13:03,647 --> 00:13:08,932
Scott: or you're this guy named Pitt who's sort of like an angel type of thing Cherub something like that.

227
00:13:08,993 --> 00:13:09,720
Rym: yeah, you're a little angel.

228
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,323
Rym: I mean I could go.

229
00:13:10,383 --> 00:13:15,124
Rym: the plot of kid Icarus if you read the instruction book is actually more than a lot of anime I've seen.

230
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:15,929
Rym: well.

231
00:13:15,949 --> 00:13:17,560
Scott: Yeah, it's it's really good.

232
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,878
Scott: It's a game that's been forgotten and never got any sequels or anything.

233
00:13:22,024 --> 00:13:26,385
Scott: Pitt the main character is gonna be in Smash Brothers brawl So you should get familiar with him.

234
00:13:26,466 --> 00:13:28,815
Scott: now the thing about this virtual console release.

235
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:32,095
Scott: if you've never played kid Icarus It might be worth five bucks.

236
00:13:32,156 --> 00:13:34,044
Rym: however Icarus fights Medusa.

237
00:13:34,164 --> 00:13:36,190
Rym: angel packing packing packing packing.

238
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:39,719
Rym: eight followed by as many lowercase use as you can fit.

239
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,379
Scott: yeah Well if you didn't know back in the day?

240
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:48,586
Scott: Not you know Zelda 1 was like one of the first games to have a battery in it where you could save Your game on the cartridge.

241
00:13:48,606 --> 00:13:50,397
Scott: well in the u.s.. In the u.s.. That's right.

242
00:13:51,901 --> 00:13:58,200
Scott: Every other game like Metroid or what are the games Fex Antidoo, Pitt Icarus, you know Metal Gear?

243
00:13:58,583 --> 00:13:59,731
Scott: Yeah, all these games.

244
00:13:59,771 --> 00:14:00,940
Scott: you couldn't save your game.

245
00:14:01,261 --> 00:14:04,214
Scott: You got a password and you would type the password in.

246
00:14:04,274 --> 00:14:13,360
Scott: you would write the password down on paper And then you would type it into the game And it would bring you back to where you left off or to where you got the now usually the way the passwords actually worked.

247
00:14:13,844 --> 00:14:27,203
Rym: Basically they turned your piece of paper into a very small memory card where the password was actually all the data of what stuff you had and what level you were on and what your score was or whatever data They needed to save.

248
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:32,274
Rym: when you typed it in you were just telling the game to give me all of this stuff and start me At this point.

249
00:14:32,397 --> 00:14:35,884
Scott: yeah And you would buy books or magazines just to learn Passwords.

250
00:14:35,904 --> 00:14:38,279
Scott: that would bring you to the end of the game with everything like punch out.

251
00:14:38,823 --> 00:14:40,091
Scott: You know the Mike Tyson password.

252
00:14:40,111 --> 00:14:43,300
Rym: some games like one Megaman game I forget which one where you have the dot passwords.

253
00:14:43,501 --> 00:14:54,674
Rym: I figured out how the passwords worked a little bit by experimenting like I get an energy tank and I'd save the game and see what the password was and I think I figured out how to always give myself another energy tank.

254
00:14:55,116 --> 00:14:55,880
Scott: Well, that's pretty cool.

255
00:14:56,443 --> 00:14:58,998
Rym: Well, that's cuz that game didn't have so rigorous checksum.

256
00:14:59,581 --> 00:15:02,900
Scott: Yeah, later Megaman said much more difficult password systems.

257
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:11,955
Scott: But yeah, anyway in this virtual console release of kid Icarus They have taken out the password system so you can only play the game straight through.

258
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:15,027
Scott: you can't just go to the end with All the weapons or anything like that.

259
00:15:15,369 --> 00:15:16,795
Rym: Well, how do they do it?

260
00:15:16,836 --> 00:15:17,700
Rym: Can you save your game?

261
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,529
Scott: I think I don't know if you you might be able.

262
00:15:19,609 --> 00:15:21,298
Rym: I don't know because this might be interesting.

263
00:15:21,479 --> 00:15:22,404
Rym: if Cuz I mean.

264
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:26,120
Rym: obviously we don't know the full details if we didn't buy it, but I got to read up more.

265
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:40,080
Rym: But if they give you they wanted they might have done is given us instead of the NES version Which was kind of gimps they might have given us the FTS version from Japan, which not only had Battery save games it had better music like all those FTS games did.

266
00:15:40,441 --> 00:15:45,600
Scott: Yeah, the only thing I can say though is for gaming purists possibly like us.

267
00:15:46,061 --> 00:15:50,540
Scott: This is sort of sad because now all our passwords and our retro cool is no longer there.

268
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,949
Rym: Yeah, I mean Icarus fights Medusa angel is engraved.

269
00:15:54,029 --> 00:15:57,498
Rym: Those sacred words are ingrained into my head for all eternity.

270
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:02,214
Scott: However Nintendo was wise and good enough to that.

271
00:16:02,334 --> 00:16:12,800
Scott: when you go into the Nintendo we store to buy this game It says in text before you pay money the passwords in the original are not in this game.

272
00:16:13,281 --> 00:16:15,870
Scott: So, you know what you're buying before you buy it.

273
00:16:15,911 --> 00:16:17,095
Scott: So it's not like a surprise.

274
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:18,620
Scott: you bought it without the passwords.

275
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,088
Scott: Hahaha, it's this doesn't have the passwords.

276
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:22,051
Scott: Are you still gonna buy it?

277
00:16:22,171 --> 00:16:24,780
Scott: and that's cool that they actually bother to tell you good on them.

278
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:32,580
Rym: Yep, so I did I defy any of you out there to legitimately beat kid Icarus in any reasonable span of time.

279
00:16:33,042 --> 00:16:33,827
Scott: Someone's gonna do it.

280
00:16:34,008 --> 00:16:36,120
Scott: I'm sure this speed runs, but whatever.

281
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:46,740
Rym: Hey I was a hard core Nintendo gamer as a kid and kid Icarus that that's one of the few games where I would Halfway through playing just start yelling obscenities and pull the game out and throw it across the room.

282
00:16:46,921 --> 00:16:49,440
Scott: I just died and gave up and played something else one time.

283
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,096
Rym: I got the credit card in the game not as hard as silver sir and the credit card.

284
00:16:53,157 --> 00:16:55,931
Rym: I was so happy He's like I can finally afford something.

285
00:16:55,952 --> 00:17:01,013
Rym: cuz I could never afford dick, you know I'd be fighting monsters and getting a million hearts and I thought I was doing great.

286
00:17:01,415 --> 00:17:06,171
Rym: and then I'd get to a store like the First store in the game and I'd have like a hundred hearts.

287
00:17:06,211 --> 00:17:07,556
Rym: and that took me an hour to get.

288
00:17:08,017 --> 00:17:13,071
Rym: I go into that door And the cheapest thing the guys selling is like 800 hearts.

289
00:17:13,173 --> 00:17:14,637
Scott: Yeah, how are you supposed to get 800 hearts by then?

290
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,750
Rym: You want to know how you're supposed to do that one.

291
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:22,400
Rym: you have to do all those challenge rooms, you know There's rooms you went into that was full of monsters that killed you immediately.

292
00:17:22,845 --> 00:17:26,211
Scott: No, I just remember rooms I would go in that were full of monsters and I couldn't.

293
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:29,446
Scott: I knew that I was supposed to do something in there But I had no idea what the hell to do.

294
00:17:29,467 --> 00:17:31,115
Rym: Yeah, you know what kill them all.

295
00:17:31,296 --> 00:17:32,160
Rym: they're worth a lot of money.

296
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:34,299
Scott: I would kill them all and it still wouldn't do anything for me.

297
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,839
Rym: Well, no, they all drop the big hearts which are worth more than one heart.

298
00:17:38,561 --> 00:17:40,772
Rym: And also you can sometimes get bonuses and all that.

299
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:42,380
Rym: but what you're supposed to go to the rooms?

300
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,639
Scott: They'd be like empty like what the hell am I supposed to do in here?

301
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:48,678
Rym: Well, sometimes you could stand in the middle and jump up and down and stuff would happen.

302
00:17:48,758 --> 00:17:50,504
Rym: really There's a lot of secrets.

303
00:17:50,585 --> 00:17:55,360
Scott: there's a lot of weird shit like that that that that makes the game kind of arbitrarily more difficult.

304
00:17:55,641 --> 00:18:02,162
Rym: I mean part of it was that the game was glitchy like Metroid and part of it more glitchy and part was glitchy in the Same way.

305
00:18:02,343 --> 00:18:10,956
Rym: Yes more glitchy in was that the game put a lot more complexity than a game of that Caliber warranted and it didn't really document any of it.

306
00:18:11,318 --> 00:18:13,599
Rym: Yeah Yeah But no, you know how you made all that money.

307
00:18:14,162 --> 00:18:22,859
Rym: You sit there at the beginning of the game where those five cute little snakes will fall down and you shoot them all and They give you a few hearts and then five more fall down and you shoot them all.

308
00:18:23,281 --> 00:18:25,268
Rym: five more fall down and you shoot them all.

309
00:18:25,308 --> 00:18:33,409
Scott: if anyone sits there shooting the first five snakes in the game until you get like a thousand hearts Why didn't you just play World of Warcraft?

310
00:18:33,429 --> 00:18:35,480
Scott: you've been better off so I got to cover for me.

311
00:18:35,761 --> 00:18:40,800
Rym: So I got the credit card and I got it and it lets you buy something if you don't have enough money.

312
00:18:40,902 --> 00:18:48,720
Rym: I'm like hot diggity Damn, and I bought something and a credit card went into debt and now I couldn't buy anything until I pay it off the debt.

313
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:54,216
Rym: And like two hours later, I wasn't even close to paying off the debt and the item was long since useless.

314
00:18:54,277 --> 00:18:56,524
Rym: Oh God, yeah.

315
00:18:56,745 --> 00:18:56,945
Scott: Yeah.

316
00:18:57,628 --> 00:19:01,240
Scott: All right, so there have been some rumors going around lately.

317
00:19:01,321 --> 00:19:02,412
Scott: So I wanted to be clear.

318
00:19:02,453 --> 00:19:03,140
Rym: go and run.

319
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:08,017
Scott: I wanted to be very clear that everything I'm gonna say is completely rumored and could be just bullshit.

320
00:19:08,077 --> 00:19:08,439
Scott: Whatever.

321
00:19:08,659 --> 00:19:10,880
Rym: Yep For example Scott is intelligent.

322
00:19:11,747 --> 00:19:19,844
Scott: Yeah anyway, the rumors all concern the possibility of Dungeons & Dragons fourth edition.

323
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:23,112
Rym: now, I have one response to that.

324
00:19:23,232 --> 00:19:33,020
Rym: if it's true and that is me standing in front of Hasbro going You expect me to pay money to you again, you know, I have all my money.

325
00:19:33,683 --> 00:19:35,954
Scott: Yeah, well, no, we didn't give them that much money.

326
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:38,344
Rym: when you really think about it We can start in turn.

327
00:19:38,364 --> 00:19:39,368
Rym: I'm back in the day.

328
00:19:39,388 --> 00:19:42,398
Rym: I bought a lot of second edition D&D books.

329
00:19:42,418 --> 00:19:42,980
Rym: That's true.

330
00:19:43,241 --> 00:19:49,120
Rym: I have probably eight hundred dollars worth of various books for Dungeons & Dragons.

331
00:19:49,501 --> 00:19:53,655
Rym: Yeah, anyway, here's some of the especially if you count all the back issues of Dragon magazine.

332
00:19:53,695 --> 00:19:54,940
Rym: I bought and didn't read.

333
00:19:55,435 --> 00:20:00,080
Scott: Yeah One rumor says it'll be announced this year and released next year.

334
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,534
Scott: Another rumor says will be announced this year and released in 2009 or like 2011 or something crazy like that.

335
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:10,658
Rym: Well, the thing is D&D third ed is good in a lot of ways and bad in a lot of ways.

336
00:20:10,718 --> 00:20:17,217
Rym: Whatever D&D 3.5 ed was it felt mostly like a money grab and it annoyed me.

337
00:20:17,237 --> 00:20:23,773
Rym: and the only reason I have a 3.5 edition book is Because my current players handbook is falling apart to the point of look.

338
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:28,710
Scott: if you don't know how to take care of your D&D Phbs, I think you'd like harass them on purpose.

339
00:20:28,871 --> 00:20:35,171
Rym: See Scott you say that except I only had one PHP That looked like that ever and in fact all my second ed books are pristine.

340
00:20:35,452 --> 00:20:40,434
Rym: for some reason the cover of that book Just fell off right away through no fault of my own.

341
00:20:40,454 --> 00:20:41,259
Scott: It's cause you removed the CD.

342
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:45,128
Rym: What do you mean that cursed seal?

343
00:20:45,288 --> 00:21:04,927
Scott: Yes, anyway another rumor says that Wizards slash Hasbro might spin off like get drop the D&D product like the whole D&D thing from them and Some people are saying oh they're gonna keep third ed going and they're gonna bring fourth ed Alongside and not get rid of third ed.

344
00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:10,240
Scott: some people say fourth ed is gonna replace third ed over time And all sorts of crazy stuff.

345
00:21:10,801 --> 00:21:13,127
Rym: I submit that it doesn't matter anymore.

346
00:21:13,709 --> 00:21:22,777
Rym: and with the advent of the Internet once someone knows the rules to a role-playing system Yeah, you don't need to buy anything from the company anymore at all.

347
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:24,755
Rym: Yep I mean there was no internet.

348
00:21:24,775 --> 00:21:33,060
Rym: back in the day I bought D&D books cuz that was the only way to get all these rules and all this material And I wasn't about to write it on my own and I didn't have the wealth of the Internet.

349
00:21:33,241 --> 00:21:37,140
Scott: I think it's like with a board game or something like that or the video game.

350
00:21:37,521 --> 00:21:41,773
Scott: You need to have a physical thing to play the game with a role-playing game.

351
00:21:42,274 --> 00:21:44,420
Scott: All you need is knowledge of the rules.

352
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:47,680
Scott: I mean like, you know, cuz all they're really selling you is a rule book.

353
00:21:47,821 --> 00:21:51,520
Scott: Imagine if monopoly didn't need a board pieces or paper money or anything.

354
00:21:51,862 --> 00:21:53,870
Scott: All you needed to know is the rules of monopoly.

355
00:21:53,951 --> 00:21:55,879
Scott: you could read the rule book of monopoly once.

356
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:59,169
Scott: Get rid of it and you can play monopoly whenever.

357
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:03,706
Rym: I've run into some poor people who when they like German games But they can't afford them.

358
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:06,120
Rym: They'll find out the rules recreate them and play them.

359
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:08,250
Rym: And actually we did that once with liar's dice.

360
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:08,993
Scott: We did do that.

361
00:22:09,114 --> 00:22:10,480
Scott: liar's dice is not really German.

362
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,564
Scott: It's not a complicated game.

363
00:22:11,584 --> 00:22:13,250
Scott: You're supposed to make liar's dice.

364
00:22:13,431 --> 00:22:15,840
Rym: Yeah, but that our making was so ghetto.

365
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:20,034
Scott: It was a ghetto making but anyway, you know with it rather RPG.

366
00:22:20,415 --> 00:22:25,180
Scott: once you know the rules There's no reason to really buy anything.

367
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,168
Scott: All you need is paper pencils and dice.

368
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:32,528
Rym: now then again what you can buy and what there's a good market for are Supplements and story ideas.

369
00:22:32,568 --> 00:22:33,171
Scott: That's what they make.

370
00:22:33,211 --> 00:22:35,140
Scott: all their money is a book of spells.

371
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,472
Scott: They're like, there's no way you can know all these spells.

372
00:22:37,492 --> 00:22:38,437
Scott: You need to buy the book.

373
00:22:38,477 --> 00:22:39,642
Rym: Hahaha Well, no I'm to see.

374
00:22:39,662 --> 00:22:41,429
Rym: the thing is what they what they used to do.

375
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:57,359
Rym: a lot of the D&D books I have that I actually bought from back in the day include almost zero Actual rules from the game and they were mostly back story story ideas character stuff things to help you as a dungeon master or a player flesh out your game.

376
00:22:57,379 --> 00:23:03,095
Rym: and All those books are just as useful in third ed as they were in second ed because I'm smart.

377
00:23:03,376 --> 00:23:08,757
Rym: if I need to come up With what this second ed character would look like in third ed I can do it.

378
00:23:08,878 --> 00:23:09,199
Scott: and about.

379
00:23:09,219 --> 00:23:18,960
Rym: yeah Like less than 10 minutes, you can change all the numbers without difficulty So I don't need to buy another book telling me about Elminster or race Lynn or whoever.

380
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:28,458
Scott: Yep Now that actually brings us to the last rumor that I remember is that D&D fourth ed might be more miniatures centric.

381
00:23:29,105 --> 00:23:32,270
Scott: So it's like huh, you know they I guess they realize.

382
00:23:32,612 --> 00:23:42,268
Scott: if this rumor is true if They realize that selling the rules doesn't really work now because people get the PDF learn the rules and they don't need to give you Any money making it more miniatures centric.

383
00:23:42,649 --> 00:23:47,908
Scott: They can make money selling more miniatures to people, you know that D&D miniatures I guess has been pretty successful.

384
00:23:47,969 --> 00:23:54,979
Scott: I mean, yeah, I don't play it But I know some people who bought the miniatures and I see people who playing normal D&D.

385
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,519
Scott: You just have the miniatures, you know, and I guess they're making some money off of them.

386
00:24:00,182 --> 00:24:04,120
Scott: So hey, they're making more money off of them that they made off of chain mail or anything.

387
00:24:04,562 --> 00:24:10,698
Rym: Yeah, but I mean what if I bought from them in the past several years other than a new players handbook Nothing by me.

388
00:24:10,864 --> 00:24:27,780
Rym: in fact The last thing I bought for Dungeons & Dragons and I regret it to this day was the book that was supposed to have the blade Singer in it because I played this long campaign way way back in high school Where I played a blade singer and it was a great campaign and I we didn't have rules for a blade singer in third ed.

389
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,584
Rym: So we made something up.

390
00:24:28,644 --> 00:24:28,906
Rym: it worked.

391
00:24:28,966 --> 00:24:31,640
Rym: Okay, and I was kind of excited about the official thing.

392
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,587
Rym: I was gonna remake the character and see how it worked.

393
00:24:34,249 --> 00:24:42,820
Rym: So I bought the book on my way home Like I got home and I opened the book the blade singer in the book was broken.

394
00:24:43,344 --> 00:24:45,480
Rym: It was full of typos and missing all the information.

395
00:24:47,264 --> 00:24:49,554
Rym: Nah, I I was flabbergasted.

396
00:24:49,594 --> 00:24:50,900
Rym: The store wouldn't take the book back.

397
00:24:51,221 --> 00:24:54,455
Rym: They published for free online the corrected blade singer.

398
00:24:54,535 --> 00:25:01,760
Rym: like a week later And pretty much from that day forth I just wouldn't buy anything from them anymore.

399
00:25:01,981 --> 00:25:04,590
Scott: Yeah, well, here's my is my personal suggestion to people.

400
00:25:04,791 --> 00:25:08,724
Scott: if all these rumors are BS then whatever just keep Role-playing however you want.

401
00:25:09,246 --> 00:25:16,636
Scott: if the rumor if any of these rumors are true and fourth edition D&D starts to rear its ugly head Buy burning wheel and pretend it's fourth edition.

402
00:25:16,796 --> 00:25:21,376
Rym: Yeah Okay, cool or I don't know.

403
00:25:21,416 --> 00:25:24,377
Scott: inspectors Inspectors, I don't think it's a replacement for D&D.

404
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,167
Scott: That's sort of a you know, if you.

405
00:25:26,287 --> 00:25:30,484
Scott: but if you have inspectors and you have burning wheel You don't really.

406
00:25:30,504 --> 00:25:34,315
Scott: I couldn't see many other role-playing systems that you would need to have.

407
00:25:34,355 --> 00:25:43,767
Rym: the only thing burning wheel lacks Currently for us and we haven't bought more recent books is high magic like burning wheel doesn't work for the realm said I don't think the magic burner is available.

408
00:25:43,787 --> 00:25:46,620
Scott: There's also burning empires, which is the sci-fi instead of the fantasy.

409
00:25:46,808 --> 00:25:54,767
Rym: Oh, yeah But I'm just saying the only thing we can't do with burning wheel easily right now is a forgotten realms kind of high Magic setting without a lot of tweaking.

410
00:25:55,068 --> 00:25:55,329
Scott: Yeah.

411
00:25:55,991 --> 00:25:56,232
Scott: Oh, well.

412
00:25:56,533 --> 00:25:58,420
Rym: Yeah, but we've talked about burning wheel.

413
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,925
Rym: We'll talk about it again in the future.

414
00:25:59,985 --> 00:26:00,366
Rym: Someday.

415
00:26:00,426 --> 00:26:04,600
Rym: We'll actually play it on our own more than once shittily at 3 in the morning.

416
00:26:04,621 --> 00:26:07,247
Scott: Yeah We're also gonna play.

417
00:26:07,267 --> 00:26:09,400
Scott: it will probably play more inspectors sooner.

418
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,247
Scott: We could probably do an episode on that eventually.

419
00:26:11,749 --> 00:26:13,114
Scott: Maybe I can get that guy on the show.

420
00:26:13,134 --> 00:26:22,312
Rym: He's really awesome things of the day.

421
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:25,960
Rym: I Had some video game thing, but I had to talk about this.

422
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:34,724
Rym: Apparently this company is putting out a product called horn tones FX 550 the what?

423
00:26:35,085 --> 00:26:43,340
Rym: now what this does is a little box that you put in your car and you hook it up to a bunch Of other things and it has a spot for a USB flash drive.

424
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,604
Rym: You can get files off of it.

425
00:26:44,985 --> 00:26:51,630
Rym: All right, and it allows you to save up to eight files Audio files on it of any set.

426
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:54,080
Scott: Oh, I guess as much as you can fit on the USB flash drive.

427
00:26:54,864 --> 00:26:55,889
Rym: Well, you take the flash drive out.

428
00:26:55,909 --> 00:26:56,813
Rym: That's just to put them on.

429
00:26:56,853 --> 00:26:58,541
Rym: it doesn't say how long they can be Uh-huh.

430
00:26:58,923 --> 00:27:03,180
Rym: Now what it does is it ties this into your car's horn?

431
00:27:03,981 --> 00:27:06,732
Rym: and now you can tell your horn to when you honk it.

432
00:27:06,873 --> 00:27:11,848
Rym: either honk or I don't know play a funny wav file.

433
00:27:11,888 --> 00:27:15,718
Scott: Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo?

434
00:27:16,861 --> 00:27:19,152
Rym: Aside from the fact that this is illegal in most states.

435
00:27:19,213 --> 00:27:30,899
Rym: Yeah for obvious reasons I mean, I mean I we live in New York and I don't know how many people who listen to this show considering how many Australian and British well albionic listeners we have.

436
00:27:31,862 --> 00:27:38,247
Rym: But in New York City, there are a lot of places where there's a three hundred and fifty to five hundred dollar fine if you honk your horn.

437
00:27:38,287 --> 00:27:42,976
Scott: well if you honk your horn when you you know you're not supposed to I mean yeah someone's about to hit you and you honk the horn.

438
00:27:42,996 --> 00:27:45,309
Scott: that's the cops not gonna give you a ticket.

439
00:27:45,489 --> 00:27:46,655
Rym: yeah but legally the.

440
00:27:46,856 --> 00:27:48,747
Rym: the rules for honking horns in the u.s.

441
00:27:48,787 --> 00:27:50,880
Rym: especially in urban areas are actually really strict.

442
00:27:51,181 --> 00:27:54,776
Scott: yeah let alone written law is much stricter than the enforced law.

443
00:27:54,877 --> 00:27:58,508
Rym: let alone modifying your horn to play an mp3.

444
00:27:58,528 --> 00:28:01,900
Scott: no modifying your horn or not having a horn.

445
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,953
Scott: you won't pass inspection with a modified horn.

446
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:10,264
Rym: there's no way you realize that when they inspected my car they didn't check the horn a real full inspection.

447
00:28:10,345 --> 00:28:11,231
Scott: it was theoretically.

448
00:28:11,271 --> 00:28:12,519
Rym: they actually checked everything else.

449
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:15,210
Rym: they found my broken front control arm.

450
00:28:15,351 --> 00:28:18,828
Rym: yeah yeah which I knew about because the car wasn't turning so well.

451
00:28:18,848 --> 00:28:20,459
Scott: it reminds me I need an inspection pretty soon.

452
00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:21,122
Scott: I'll go next week.

453
00:28:22,225 --> 00:28:26,159
Scott: but anyway yeah I could see some funny uses for that one like.

454
00:28:26,179 --> 00:28:29,269
Scott: I don't know the sound of an ambulance.

455
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:32,538
Rym: yeah that's not illegal all right.

456
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:37,174
Scott: maybe likes you know a gangster going coppers never catch me alive.

457
00:28:37,194 --> 00:28:39,483
Rym: something like that I don't know.

458
00:28:39,543 --> 00:28:47,723
Rym: I'd probably have something along the lines of put down that cell phone and pay attention or turn on your goddamn head low turn on your goddamn headlights.

459
00:28:47,784 --> 00:28:48,428
Scott: I would put that right.

460
00:28:48,489 --> 00:28:48,811
Scott: I was right.

461
00:28:48,891 --> 00:28:51,505
Rym: yeah I was driving home from work today and I passed.

462
00:28:52,088 --> 00:29:05,348
Rym: probably see I could exaggerate and say like a hundred people but instead I'll say the actual number like 99 people who just didn't have their headlights on or had their parking lights on despite the fact that it died that it was dark.

463
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:08,482
Scott: if you're not in a parking lot do not turn on your parking lights.

464
00:29:09,003 --> 00:29:12,110
Scott: god alright.

465
00:29:12,651 --> 00:29:16,720
Rym: anyway this product has bad idea written all over.

466
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:20,035
Scott: it also has awesome entertainment for Scott written all over it.

467
00:29:20,277 --> 00:29:23,173
Rym: I'll bet in the end it's gonna have videos on YouTube written.

468
00:29:23,234 --> 00:29:28,760
Scott: all I bet you in the end is gonna be a local news story about these things saying oh danger on the highway.

469
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:29,442
Scott: something son.

470
00:29:30,866 --> 00:29:46,539
Scott: anyway I got a little theme going this week and I started off yesterday with some old awesome jazz and I was gonna continue it today with some more old awesome jazz but instead I got some sort of modernish jazz if you will.

471
00:29:47,862 --> 00:29:58,019
Scott: this video just came up out of nowhere almost of an idea that I've had for a long time which was make a robot that plays an actual music instrument.

472
00:29:58,039 --> 00:30:07,103
Scott: I mean we've had MIDI instruments for a while where a computer sends digital information to a digital instrument and the digital instrument is then played like a player.

473
00:30:07,143 --> 00:30:18,881
Scott: piano is played but no one's really made like a robot that you attach to say an actual acoustic guitar and then the robot strums it and fingers it.

474
00:30:19,082 --> 00:30:23,319
Rym: see the difficulty here comes down to how you interface with the instrument.

475
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,666
Rym: I mean a piano.

476
00:30:24,687 --> 00:30:26,637
Rym: a robot that plays the piano would be easy.

477
00:30:26,697 --> 00:30:29,456
Rym: all you have to do is hit the keys hard or soft and manipulate the.

478
00:30:29,476 --> 00:30:32,692
Scott: yeah I think there probably were piano playing robots but that's not the.

479
00:30:32,733 --> 00:30:35,789
Rym: yeah but like a trumpet playing robots real hard cuz.

480
00:30:35,829 --> 00:30:39,769
Rym: not only do you have to do the keys and everything but you've got to simulate human lips.

481
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:42,359
Rym: yeah not easy not easy at all.

482
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:48,667
Rym: I mean I have enough trouble simulating good trumpet playing human lips with my actual trumpet playing human lips.

483
00:30:48,807 --> 00:30:55,491
Scott: yeah anyway we have here's a video of a robot that plays a saxophone.

484
00:30:55,933 --> 00:30:57,780
Rym: it's pretty impressive and a little scary looking.

485
00:30:58,101 --> 00:31:08,416
Scott: yeah I mean obviously the music that comes out of the saxophone is sort of emotionless because it's the same exact blowing for every note.

486
00:31:08,938 --> 00:31:11,546
Scott: so it's very mechanical sounding.

487
00:31:11,587 --> 00:31:13,373
Rym: yeah there's no vibrato or anything.

488
00:31:13,433 --> 00:31:23,592
Scott: yeah however it's a real saxophone being played by a robot and it's playing a John Coltrane solo like to the T like as the music is written.

489
00:31:23,613 --> 00:31:28,458
Scott: yeah doesn't sound so great because it's a robot playing it but that'll get better in time.

490
00:31:28,478 --> 00:31:31,878
Scott: there's no reason the robot couldn't play in a way that sounds good to people.

491
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:34,791
Rym: I look forward to the day where you can record.

492
00:31:35,354 --> 00:31:36,097
Rym: I mean like we do now.

493
00:31:36,138 --> 00:31:53,132
Rym: you set up a system somehow to record a great musician playing a thing and then instead of playing an audio file or you know some sort of recording of this band playing you have a stage with all these robots and they just perfectly recreate whatever the band played with actual instruments.

494
00:31:53,675 --> 00:31:59,679
Scott: yeah I mean no matter what kind of recorded audio you have recording is lossy by definition.

495
00:31:59,699 --> 00:32:12,519
Scott: you know if you put a microphone right up next to like a violin and record the violin master playing on the best violin you can get it to sound good enough to where someone couldn't tell the difference but it's still not the same.

496
00:32:12,841 --> 00:32:14,086
Rym: it's not absolutely perfect.

497
00:32:14,106 --> 00:32:17,499
Rym: just by the fact that a lot goes on in audio.

498
00:32:17,539 --> 00:32:29,719
Rym: I mean subtle vibrations here and there and audio files like to BS about all that stuff but the fact remains that it's very difficult to argue that people couldn't tell the difference between a live performance and a recording.

499
00:32:29,779 --> 00:32:43,693
Scott: yeah if I got you a super audio CD which is just about as goddamn good a recording as you can get of an orchestra at doing a whole symphony and I played it for you on like a $30,000 sound system that would sound damn good.

500
00:32:44,135 --> 00:32:47,270
Scott: but then if I took you to the orchestra it would still be better.

501
00:32:47,451 --> 00:32:50,848
Rym: well hopefully it could be worse if the acoustics of the theater were bad.

502
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:52,074
Scott: I guess I guess it.

503
00:32:52,094 --> 00:32:56,152
Scott: yeah I'd hope that the orchestra would be better at least the way it feels.

504
00:32:56,614 --> 00:33:18,990
Scott: but if you just had the instruments and you somehow recorded the actual movements of the people in the orchestra like how they move their arms and their lips and how much they blow and you had robots copy what they did you could actually recreate the symphony as it was played in the orchestra in your house if you had enough room for all those robots and that's pretty cool.

505
00:33:19,613 --> 00:33:22,827
Scott: just one of Scott's crazy ideas that I actually came to fruition somehow.

506
00:33:23,048 --> 00:33:23,330
Rym: yeah.

507
00:33:24,134 --> 00:33:27,087
Rym: so as long as we don't get the power to stop time everything's still okay.

508
00:33:27,488 --> 00:33:28,834
Rym: yep all right.

509
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:38,751
Rym: so we haven't talked about board games in a while because we've been playing a lot of other games mostly DS and Wii games though we have been playing a lot of board games just not board games we really needed to review though.

510
00:33:38,811 --> 00:33:45,146
Rym: now just before this we busted out a bunch of old board games forgot how much we liked it but yeah it is definitely DS season though.

511
00:33:45,427 --> 00:33:52,658
Rym: up until very recently however I had been on a far longer than should have been winning streak at German board games.

512
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:56,515
Rym: I was winning a sickly disproportionate number.

513
00:33:56,536 --> 00:33:59,029
Scott: that might have something to do with us playing a lot of Carcassonne.

514
00:33:59,049 --> 00:34:00,819
Rym: well not just Carcassonne but also Antecker.

515
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:04,475
Rym: we're playing tile laying games where there's my undisputed domain.

516
00:34:04,676 --> 00:34:05,460
Scott: yeah Rym likes the.

517
00:34:06,723 --> 00:34:10,750
Rym: Yeah I don't like them so much I'm just good at them kind of like how you're good at Web of Power even though you hate it.

518
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:12,340
Scott: well you don't hate Carcassonne.

519
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,987
Scott: no like I don't like Web of Power.

520
00:34:14,027 --> 00:34:24,052
Rym: true true true but finally it was brought to a bitter end where we brought out El Grande a game that I'm pretty good at and Alex won and then we busted out.

521
00:34:24,293 --> 00:34:31,311
Rym: uh what else did we play the game we're gonna talk about all right the game we're gonna review because it's GeekNights and we review board games occasionally.

522
00:34:31,331 --> 00:34:35,089
Scott: the game we're gonna talk about today is Thurn and Texas.

523
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:48,438
Scott: now Thurn and Texas has been pretty hot stuff lately and this is why first of all it won the spiel des Jahres in 2006. now for anyone who doesn't know what the spiel des Jahres is it's litter.

524
00:34:48,498 --> 00:34:54,882
Scott: it's German for game of the year and they give it out every year to the game of the year.

525
00:34:55,043 --> 00:34:57,759
Rym: think it's like the equivalent of the Oscar for Best Picture.

526
00:34:57,799 --> 00:34:58,884
Scott: that's pretty much what it is.

527
00:34:58,964 --> 00:35:02,900
Scott: if a board game wins spiel des Jahres that's holy shit.

528
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,085
Scott: that's the fucking game.

529
00:35:04,126 --> 00:35:07,782
Rym: this year we own most of the spiel des Jahres in recent memory.

530
00:35:07,882 --> 00:35:17,555
Scott: well yeah except for that weird Towery one with yeah pieces but yeah now the game is designed by Andreas Seyfarth.

531
00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:19,040
Scott: I'm pretty sure that's how you say it.

532
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:23,033
Scott: yeah he's one of our men yeah and his wife Karen Seyfarth.

533
00:35:23,113 --> 00:35:29,977
Scott: really yes now another game by Andreas Seyfarth also won the spiel des Jahres.

534
00:35:30,017 --> 00:35:33,587
Scott: that game would be Puerto Rico the best board game ever.

535
00:35:33,728 --> 00:35:44,406
Scott: yes so the fact that Andreas Seyfarth wins another spiel des Jahres means that this game is probably hot stuff and you know what it is.

536
00:35:44,426 --> 00:35:46,496
Rym: I mean it's not the best game in the world.

537
00:35:46,516 --> 00:35:47,601
Scott: it's not the best game in the world.

538
00:35:47,661 --> 00:35:50,194
Rym: is he really Tigers and Euphrates and Puerto Rico?

539
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:55,160
Rym: for the longest time nothing has unseated those two in terms of best game and most fun game.

540
00:35:55,501 --> 00:36:06,715
Scott: but this game sort of combines like all the hot trends in recent German board game design night very perfectly into just one game.

541
00:36:06,736 --> 00:36:16,794
Rym: yes it did very specifically adds and takes elements that I like that you never really see these elements in the same game and here they are very elegantly done.

542
00:36:16,814 --> 00:36:19,686
Scott: yep all right now how did I get this game?

543
00:36:20,369 --> 00:36:28,122
Scott: I was in the city and there's a store there called complete strategist C O M P L E A T strategist and I always knew it was there.

544
00:36:28,182 --> 00:36:30,435
Scott: but I didn't know exactly physically where it was.

545
00:36:30,717 --> 00:36:32,384
Scott: but I wrote down the address and I went there.

546
00:36:32,545 --> 00:36:37,004
Scott: now I expected it to be holy crap a game store in New York City.

547
00:36:37,024 --> 00:36:38,612
Scott: this must be the greatest game store ever.

548
00:36:39,195 --> 00:36:46,423
Scott: well I got went in there and it looks with my eyeballs like the typical Scuzzy game store and I'm like.

549
00:36:46,805 --> 00:36:47,969
Rym: you know what those stores are.

550
00:36:48,009 --> 00:36:49,976
Rym: they're all smelly yeah but staying.

551
00:36:49,996 --> 00:36:54,215
Scott: the reason I didn't leave immediately was it actually didn't smell.

552
00:36:54,235 --> 00:37:00,904
Scott: I was quite surprised Wow because my eyes told me this store would smell but my nose didn't smell anything.

553
00:37:01,165 --> 00:37:07,311
Scott: maybe it's because the street outside smells so the inside does not I don't know but it didn't smell.

554
00:37:08,013 --> 00:37:11,023
Scott: and the employees were nerdy but intelligent and helpful.

555
00:37:12,046 --> 00:37:20,459
Scott: and I must say though for as small and kind of really crammed in this store is I mean physical space was at a loss in this store.

556
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,272
Scott: there were no tables to play games or anything like that that I saw.

557
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:28,210
Scott: but the stock of this store was phenomenal.

558
00:37:28,531 --> 00:37:30,777
Scott: they had games up to the ceiling.

559
00:37:30,918 --> 00:37:39,854
Scott: every game you could think of was there from like the oldest to the newest and games that other stores have like zero or maybe one copy of.

560
00:37:39,954 --> 00:37:42,744
Scott: if you're lucky they had like 10 copies of or more.

561
00:37:42,845 --> 00:37:50,877
Scott: it was crazy out of control and most of the games were sold not at super low prices but not overpriced either.

562
00:37:50,917 --> 00:37:53,149
Scott: I mean I got third in taxes for 30 something bucks.

563
00:37:53,249 --> 00:37:59,082
Scott: it's you know it's only a few dollars more than I would have paid online and after shipping it was probably like a dollar cheaper.

564
00:37:59,263 --> 00:38:01,175
Rym: yeah plus I mean that's what board games cost.

565
00:38:01,215 --> 00:38:06,426
Rym: you can't get him cheap unless you have a friend who buys games on impulse and then decides he doesn't like our friend who makes games.

566
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:13,655
Scott: so the American release of this game is by Rigo Grand who is quite a good bringer of board games to America.

567
00:38:13,876 --> 00:38:16,830
Rym: yep pieces are all high-quality boxes nice.

568
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:17,412
Rym: what can I say?

569
00:38:17,693 --> 00:38:18,758
Scott: yeah the box is like.

570
00:38:18,798 --> 00:38:20,586
Rym: there's good panning across the center channel.

571
00:38:21,369 --> 00:38:28,566
Scott: there's a lot of extra room in the box for like more stuff and I think that as expansions come that might be good because you can fit it in there.

572
00:38:28,586 --> 00:38:39,578
Scott: the only really complaints I have about the physical miss of this board game are that there's these cards that they're kind of small and they're not super durable and you use them a lot.

573
00:38:39,678 --> 00:38:43,059
Scott: so over time they might get kind of worn out but they're pretty much the whole game.

574
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:47,923
Scott: it's not really a big deal when you when you get right down to it and the price is right for what you get.

575
00:38:47,943 --> 00:38:50,011
Scott: the wooden houses I also like they're very nice.

576
00:38:51,317 --> 00:38:53,868
Scott: so what kind of game is thrown in Texas?

577
00:38:54,189 --> 00:38:55,556
Rym: it's kind of like ticket to ride.

578
00:38:56,018 --> 00:39:05,400
Scott: yeah ticket to ride has the card drawing mechanism where there are face-up cards and also a face-down deck and on your turn you can take face-up cards or face-down car.

579
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,006
Scott: you know you take from those cards.

580
00:39:07,529 --> 00:39:15,243
Scott: and third and taxes the same way there will be six face-up cards and a face-down deck and you can take cards from the face-up or from the deck.

581
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:20,108
Rym: now it also has this element of you're trying to make paths among all these cities on the board.

582
00:39:20,148 --> 00:39:21,616
Rym: the board is basically a map of Germany.

583
00:39:21,636 --> 00:39:26,944
Rym: all these cities and the cities are different zones of different colors and they'll have names.

584
00:39:27,387 --> 00:39:29,197
Rym: and you're trying to make routes along.

585
00:39:29,217 --> 00:39:34,383
Rym: you know contiguous routes from city to city to city point to point along the roads to accomplish various goals.

586
00:39:35,668 --> 00:39:39,464
Scott: I can't even begin to count how many games involved connecting nodes on a map.

587
00:39:39,745 --> 00:39:51,209
Rym: yep but one one primary difference that in this game you make the routes with cards that you lay in front of you instead of on the mat and you can't block other players.

588
00:39:51,249 --> 00:39:55,591
Rym: so another player moving around the board does not directly influence you moving around on the board.

589
00:39:55,611 --> 00:40:00,960
Scott: yeah now this playing cards in front of you to make a set reminded me a lot of Mario Nostrum that we played.

590
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:01,886
Scott: didn't we do a show on it?

591
00:40:02,188 --> 00:40:03,113
Rym: I don't know if we actually did.

592
00:40:03,133 --> 00:40:15,505
Scott: now we played it one set uber con so I don't know if we know enough about it to play a show on it but that's what it reminded me a lot of because in Mario Nostrum has the same thing where you get cards and you kind of make sets of cards in front of you by playing them in sequence.

593
00:40:15,847 --> 00:40:21,556
Rym: so I'll have a card of one city and then I look on them and I have you know a card of a city that on the board is next to it.

594
00:40:21,878 --> 00:40:27,868
Rym: so on my turn when I play the next city I can just play it on either side like next to the card that would be on the board.

595
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:33,315
Rym: so in the end I'll have a chain in front of me that if I follow that chain on the board it makes a continuous line.

596
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:40,908
Scott: yep now the other thing about this game is that there are four guys right and the guys are basically special powers.

597
00:40:41,109 --> 00:40:54,794
Scott: one guy lets you draw more cards one guy lets you play more cards one guy lets you score more when you score and one guy lets you take the six cards that are face up and flush them down the drain and draw six new ones which is he's the fun guy.

598
00:40:54,874 --> 00:41:04,428
Rym: yeah that's an interesting part of the game where especially if you're playing with a bunch of people and you know someone's planning ahead like they alright I need this card and oh yeah that card came up on Scott's turn.

599
00:41:04,449 --> 00:41:09,529
Rym: in two turns it's mine and then on Alex's turn he says you know what fuck this I'm flushing it.

600
00:41:09,931 --> 00:41:16,984
Scott: no you basically just can't look at the what's going on until it's your turn except you have to because you do have.

601
00:41:17,105 --> 00:41:22,130
Rym: another trick of this game is that you know you play these cards from the deck in order to go around on the board.

602
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:26,568
Rym: there are only three cards for each city on the board.

603
00:41:26,649 --> 00:41:26,990
Rym: that's right.

604
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:28,296
Rym: so I get one game.

605
00:41:28,316 --> 00:41:29,582
Rym: we were playing in one city.

606
00:41:30,085 --> 00:41:33,483
Rym: all three of them came up right away and no one picked him up and then they got flushed.

607
00:41:33,805 --> 00:41:41,425
Rym: so all of us now while we're playing the game we know that until the deck runs out and gets reshuffled there is no way to build anything in that city.

608
00:41:41,646 --> 00:41:46,328
Scott: that's right yeah and especially if you play with more players that gets kind of.

609
00:41:46,449 --> 00:41:52,519
Scott: it gets even more tricky because then people will be drawing more cars that are face down and thus you'll have less information.

610
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:58,632
Scott: you have imperfect information about what cities are out there but at the same time people's hands a decal cycle faster.

611
00:41:58,692 --> 00:42:00,721
Rym: so you're getting the cards you need.

612
00:42:00,822 --> 00:42:01,425
Scott: that is true.

613
00:42:01,526 --> 00:42:02,371
Scott: I did notice that.

614
00:42:02,632 --> 00:42:11,433
Scott: that's something great about this game actually is that if you you can play it with two three or four players and no matter what you don't have to change the rules at all.

615
00:42:11,674 --> 00:42:12,699
Rym: that's a rare game.

616
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:17,402
Scott: most games require some modification yeah and that's why I think this game is so perfect.

617
00:42:17,422 --> 00:42:23,480
Scott: when you look at tickets a ride you know and it's got the drawing mechanism and you look at Mario's dream is the card playing in a row mechanism.

618
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:27,696
Scott: but all those games are sort of they're not a hundred percent clean.

619
00:42:28,078 --> 00:42:35,269
Scott: yet somehow this game takes all those mechanisms and combines them into one game and it's perfectly clean across the board.

620
00:42:35,289 --> 00:42:38,952
Scott: you don't have to change a damn thing whether you're playing with two three or four players.

621
00:42:39,012 --> 00:42:39,977
Scott: that is phenomenal.

622
00:42:39,997 --> 00:42:43,899
Scott: I mean you don't have to change the amount of starting money because there isn't money.

623
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,717
Scott: you know you have to change how many cards people start with.

624
00:42:46,757 --> 00:42:48,104
Scott: everyone starts with no cards.

625
00:42:48,605 --> 00:42:50,412
Scott: you know it's just there it is.

626
00:42:51,055 --> 00:42:56,545
Rym: and the turn order aside from the special abilities which really simple there's the four of them and you just pick one every turn.

627
00:42:56,565 --> 00:43:00,583
Rym: yep and whichever one you pick then whenever you do that thing you get the bonus.

628
00:43:01,004 --> 00:43:07,749
Scott: basically it's draw a card play a card and then if you want score what you've already played.

629
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:10,705
Rym: total yep and there's a lot of nice tricks about that too.

630
00:43:10,745 --> 00:43:17,119
Rym: I mean you play a card you play a card once you've got at least three cards in a route at any point once you've made three.

631
00:43:17,139 --> 00:43:23,614
Rym: well technically once you've made two because you make the third one and then you can score it when you play a card on that turn.

632
00:43:23,655 --> 00:43:33,355
Rym: you can then say after you play that card I now choose to score this score it and then those cards flush out you discard your hand down to three and you begin again.

633
00:43:33,636 --> 00:43:35,585
Scott: so now here's the thing I really like about this game.

634
00:43:35,866 --> 00:43:43,530
Scott: you on your turn you must draw one and you must play one and you may score right.

635
00:43:43,932 --> 00:43:49,312
Scott: so if you don't score then the route you're currently building just kind of stays in front of you.

636
00:43:49,955 --> 00:43:51,382
Scott: then the next turn comes around.

637
00:43:51,543 --> 00:43:53,995
Scott: you must draw will drawings never a problem.

638
00:43:54,015 --> 00:43:55,401
Scott: there's always cards for you to take.

639
00:43:56,304 --> 00:43:57,348
Scott: you must play.

640
00:43:57,669 --> 00:43:57,830
Scott: now.

641
00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:04,215
Scott: you can add a city to the right side of your route or the left side cuz all your cards are played in a horizontal row.

642
00:44:04,697 --> 00:44:12,015
Scott: so whatever card is right most in your route you have to put something adjacent to that or whatever card is left most yet to place it adjacent to that.

643
00:44:12,497 --> 00:44:13,281
Rym: you can build up.

644
00:44:13,382 --> 00:44:14,247
Rym: you can't build down.

645
00:44:14,288 --> 00:44:16,200
Rym: it has to be one non branching line.

646
00:44:16,842 --> 00:44:21,974
Scott: now what if you must play you must play a card.

647
00:44:22,515 --> 00:44:27,633
Scott: if you can't play a card that adds to your route you have to get rid of that route.

648
00:44:27,653 --> 00:44:27,773
Scott: it's.

649
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:29,882
Scott: and then you put another cart.

650
00:44:29,922 --> 00:44:31,891
Scott: you start a new one by putting a card down.

651
00:44:32,453 --> 00:44:39,763
Scott: so if you decided not to score the route last turn you get to the next turn and you can't add anything to it.

652
00:44:40,125 --> 00:44:42,276
Rym: you lose it which is good and bad.

653
00:44:42,296 --> 00:44:47,285
Rym: I mean on one hand you thought yourself if that happens to you probably lose this game depending on how big the route you lose.

654
00:44:47,305 --> 00:44:49,537
Scott: I mean you might lose one card you put down one.

655
00:44:49,557 --> 00:44:51,408
Scott: the next turn comes around you get rid of it.

656
00:44:51,428 --> 00:44:53,218
Rym: but that also it's a nice mechanic.

657
00:44:53,299 --> 00:44:56,072
Rym: or if you've built a dead end route that's not going anywhere.

658
00:44:56,192 --> 00:44:59,398
Rym: it forces you to cut and run and get back into the game.

659
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:06,519
Scott: yep it's also adds this sort of building risk as your routes get longer.

660
00:45:06,539 --> 00:45:18,142
Scott: you know it's like unless you have the cards you need already in your hand you can choose to gamble and sort of try to flush the cards to see more of them to try to get the card.

661
00:45:18,162 --> 00:45:22,242
Scott: you need to make your route that little bit longer but that's a big risk.

662
00:45:22,283 --> 00:45:26,004
Scott: if you don't get the card you might lose the whole route if you don't have it in your hand already.

663
00:45:26,606 --> 00:45:32,146
Scott: so it sort of gives you this chance to maybe win with incredible luck you know.

664
00:45:32,426 --> 00:45:39,217
Scott: or play it safe and only continue a route if you know you can keep it going because you've got the cards in your hand already.

665
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:44,809
Rym: now nicely and this is something I really like about the game to just because it's so different from all the games I'm used to.

666
00:45:44,829 --> 00:45:47,644
Rym: I mean the error of board games that we play.

667
00:45:47,664 --> 00:45:49,799
Rym: the most are the ones were around the edge of the board.

668
00:45:49,819 --> 00:45:54,332
Rym: there's some sort of victory track thing yeah and you count up victory points going across.

669
00:45:55,015 --> 00:45:58,732
Rym: this is one of those other kinds of games where you count up to get at the end.

670
00:45:59,073 --> 00:46:02,751
Rym: the end of the game you score all the stuff in front of you but you know.

671
00:46:02,791 --> 00:46:06,859
Scott: what I really like though is that scoring this game takes like two seconds.

672
00:46:07,242 --> 00:46:08,166
Scott: yep it's like other.

673
00:46:08,207 --> 00:46:09,151
Rym: granted granted I'd.

674
00:46:09,252 --> 00:46:12,107
Rym: sometimes there are some games where I love the suspense of.

675
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:14,803
Rym: I don't know if I won or not that's true.

676
00:46:14,844 --> 00:46:16,433
Scott: but this game still has the suspense.

677
00:46:16,514 --> 00:46:30,385
Scott: the suspension doesn't last very long because everyone counts and like less than 30 seconds you know as opposed to spending a minute counting which I was actually kind of found annoying having to count and then recount if you're not sure you know what kind of game has that?

678
00:46:30,466 --> 00:46:32,295
Scott: Puerto Rico actually kind of has that.

679
00:46:32,315 --> 00:46:42,036
Rym: just as a rule whenever I no matter how simple a board game is pretty much actually not just in board games my entire life if I ever have to count anything I always count it twice.

680
00:46:42,201 --> 00:46:44,111
Rym: yep just automatically by instinct.

681
00:46:44,131 --> 00:46:44,573
Scott: but you know what?

682
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:47,760
Scott: in third and taxes I only have to count it once because it's just so simple.

683
00:46:47,941 --> 00:46:49,249
Rym: oh no but I count twice anyway.

684
00:46:49,269 --> 00:46:50,859
Scott: it's kind of like I've counted twice once.

685
00:46:50,939 --> 00:47:01,140
Rym: it's like my own internal error checking where up because if by chance I don't get the same result then oh yeah something's wrong with my brain or something's wrong with this counting.

686
00:47:01,522 --> 00:47:05,015
Scott: yeah but anyway the way you score in third and taxes is well.

687
00:47:05,096 --> 00:47:10,520
Scott: first there are these chits on the board that you can get for attaining certain goals.

688
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:17,940
Rym: it's kind of like in through the desert where when you do certain things you take a chit with a number of points on it right away and put it in front of you.

689
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:20,633
Scott: for example there are three purple cities on the board.

690
00:47:20,975 --> 00:47:24,614
Scott: if you get a house in every one of the purple cities there's a chit.

691
00:47:24,634 --> 00:47:28,755
Scott: there's a stack of chits and each of them is worth a certain number of points.

692
00:47:28,855 --> 00:47:30,986
Scott: the one on top of the stack is worth three points.

693
00:47:31,488 --> 00:47:35,308
Scott: so if you get a house in every purple city you take the top chit from the stack.

694
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:36,614
Scott: that's worth three points.

695
00:47:37,157 --> 00:47:39,549
Scott: now the top chit on the stack is worth two points.

696
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:53,466
Scott: so if you're the second person in the game to get a house in every one of the purple cities you get two points and you just collect these little chits as you achieve these goals throughout the game and they're actually worth a lot of points and you add them up.

697
00:47:53,727 --> 00:47:59,399
Rym: yeah one point is a big deal in this game yes but the thing is also because I mean there's the diminishing returns of.

698
00:47:59,922 --> 00:48:05,750
Rym: if someone else gets something it's now worth less to everyone else but the difference is only one point in each one.

699
00:48:06,092 --> 00:48:09,670
Rym: so being the first one to everything is really not a feasible goal.

700
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:13,690
Scott: it's really more about getting more stuff and not always getting it first.

701
00:48:13,911 --> 00:48:14,876
Rym: yeah so you like.

702
00:48:14,896 --> 00:48:20,794
Rym: you want to get some things first in order to get the five points instead of the four and you want to get all the rest of the stuff.

703
00:48:20,834 --> 00:48:26,488
Rym: like you pick a few things you're going to get first everything else you plan on getting before the end of the game just to get some points.

704
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:29,145
Rym: yep it's like I get the thing that's worth five points.

705
00:48:29,205 --> 00:48:34,438
Scott: it's like I won the most recent game by picking up something at the last second that was pretty small like three points.

706
00:48:34,518 --> 00:48:36,009
Rym: yeah and you won by just that little bit.

707
00:48:36,029 --> 00:48:37,360
Rym: if you hadn't gotten that I would have won.

708
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:37,865
Scott: that's right.

709
00:48:37,986 --> 00:48:39,380
Rym: but you did it and you did it well.

710
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,415
Rym: but say scott gets the five point thing.

711
00:48:42,898 --> 00:48:44,728
Rym: now my goal is not.

712
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:48,205
Rym: maybe I want to get the four or the three point thing to mitigate.

713
00:48:48,326 --> 00:48:51,460
Rym: so now he doesn't get as many points in the differential.

714
00:48:52,161 --> 00:48:53,587
Rym: yep so he gets the five.

715
00:48:54,109 --> 00:48:56,844
Rym: I squeak by with the three at the end to mitigate some of his five.

716
00:48:56,884 --> 00:48:58,499
Rym: so effectively his thing was only worth two.

717
00:48:58,982 --> 00:49:03,827
Rym: so if you were able to do something that other players aren't able to do you're hugely ahead.

718
00:49:04,229 --> 00:49:09,073
Rym: or if you are unable to do something that all the other players dead did you're hugely behind.

719
00:49:09,335 --> 00:49:12,392
Scott: yep now here's the other way is to get points.

720
00:49:12,754 --> 00:49:16,218
Scott: there are these carriages a three four five a six and a seven carriage.

721
00:49:16,339 --> 00:49:23,037
Scott: now that looks when you first read the rules of the game you think that these carriages are where the game is at.

722
00:49:23,278 --> 00:49:27,120
Scott: you know because if you make a route you start out the game with no carriages.

723
00:49:28,142 --> 00:49:33,450
Scott: if you make a route that is at least three cities large you can take the three carriage.

724
00:49:34,153 --> 00:49:35,900
Scott: then you have to get the four carriage.

725
00:49:36,242 --> 00:49:38,755
Scott: you can't jump to the five or to the seven right away.

726
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:38,996
Scott: yeah.

727
00:49:39,016 --> 00:49:45,626
Rym: so if you build seven routes that have seven cards each you get the three the four the five the six the seven.

728
00:49:45,828 --> 00:49:46,980
Rym: each time you build one in order.

729
00:49:47,201 --> 00:49:49,131
Scott: yeah you can't just get the seven right away.

730
00:49:49,172 --> 00:49:51,425
Scott: if your first route is seven cards you get the three.

731
00:49:51,747 --> 00:49:54,385
Scott: if your next route is eight cards you get the four.

732
00:49:54,546 --> 00:49:59,815
Rym: yep now some of the bonus chips are things like make a route that's six long so you can get.

733
00:49:59,835 --> 00:50:11,879
Rym: yeah you can get more points but yeah and the game ends when either you have put all your houses on the board which we'll get to the cool mechanic about that but basically you put houses along all the routes you've made.

734
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:22,500
Scott: and if someone gets the seven card yeah see it looks at first like hey i want to build bigger routes and i want to build them faster than anyone else.

735
00:50:22,882 --> 00:50:26,963
Scott: that way i can get all the carriages and get the seven carriages is worth the most points.

736
00:50:27,565 --> 00:50:37,059
Scott: but really when you actually play the game you realize that the carriages are more of a timer than they are a scoring mechanism.

737
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:46,482
Rym: yeah like if you everyone's gonna get the five maybe even the six carriage unless you're stupid yeah so you don't really need to blitz the carriages unless you're trying to end the game and even then that's hard to do.

738
00:50:46,603 --> 00:50:48,539
Rym: yeah what you what people tend to do is it?

739
00:50:49,442 --> 00:50:55,639
Rym: it's like a when you're doing a standardized test and you look over at someone's paper not to see what their answers are.

740
00:50:55,659 --> 00:51:00,487
Rym: you're not trying to cheat but to see how far along they are as a gauge of how far along you should be.

741
00:51:00,788 --> 00:51:14,908
Scott: yep it's like you know if someone if other people are multiple carriages ahead of you that means the game is close to an end and you haven't been making that many routes or you've been making way too many small routes and not really doing anything productive you know.

742
00:51:15,370 --> 00:51:25,483
Scott: so the game will punish you for lagging behind everyone else but it won't really punish you for not getting the seven because only your biggest carriage counts.

743
00:51:25,985 --> 00:51:31,430
Scott: so if you get the six carriage and someone else gets the seven you get seven points and they get ten.

744
00:51:31,471 --> 00:51:35,959
Scott: it's only a three point difference and the game will come down to all those chits.

745
00:51:38,222 --> 00:51:41,156
Scott: now the final bit of score is the houses.

746
00:51:41,196 --> 00:51:49,907
Scott: you have all these houses and you want to get these houses on the board and every house you don't get on the board when the game is over is minus one point.

747
00:51:50,268 --> 00:51:55,918
Rym: now usually this only comes down to being like two or three points by the end because everyone will generally have all their houses out.

748
00:51:55,999 --> 00:52:08,157
Rym: but in the most recent game one of the things that fucked me was i made a great route at the end and it brought me right within an inch of beating scott but then i had a couple more houses than him.

749
00:52:08,518 --> 00:52:08,819
Rym: yeah

750
00:52:08,839 --> 00:52:10,607
Scott: i had one house left at the end just one

751
00:52:10,748 --> 00:52:21,485
Rym: yep and i had three because the route i made at the end was perfect except that it overlapped one of my other routes and i got to put one less house than i should have and all together it just

752
00:52:21,707 --> 00:52:23,396
Scott: ah yeah this is how the houses work right.

753
00:52:23,456 --> 00:52:28,767
Scott: let's say i make a route and the route contains three gray cities and an orange.

754
00:52:28,847 --> 00:52:35,306
Rym: see the cities are all different colors and like if you get all the how all your houses have a certain color on the board you get chits for those colors and all that.

755
00:52:35,367 --> 00:52:37,080
Scott: yeah there are ways to get points with the colors.

756
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:39,230
Scott: anyway i make a route.

757
00:52:39,411 --> 00:52:45,323
Scott: all the cities had to be adjacent and all the cities have colors and all the cities of the same color are near each other.

758
00:52:45,343 --> 00:52:47,499
Scott: so all the purple cities are adjacent and such right.

759
00:52:48,042 --> 00:52:55,859
Scott: so let's say i make a route that is three gray cities and an orange city and i score the route in addition to doing all the other stuff you do.

760
00:52:55,880 --> 00:53:08,301
Scott: when you score a route you can decide to put houses either on all cities in the route of one color which means i would so in this case i would put a house on every gray city but not the orange.

761
00:53:08,421 --> 00:53:16,550
Scott: one or one city one city for one house for each city of a color in the route.

762
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:24,250
Scott: so i would do one house in orange and one in gray and you get to pick which one and you get to pick one which one of the gray cities you put the house in.

763
00:53:24,833 --> 00:53:29,700
Scott: so usually i would pick to do gray because that's three houses versus two.

764
00:53:30,062 --> 00:53:34,550
Rym: but maybe you're not gonna get the great shit anyway it's near the end of the game.

765
00:53:34,852 --> 00:53:39,440
Rym: and getting that orange how the house on that orange city is gonna get you the orange chit?

766
00:53:39,742 --> 00:53:41,836
Rym: yep that's worth far more points than nothing.

767
00:53:42,419 --> 00:53:48,368
Scott: or maybe i've already got houses in some of those gray cities and i don't need anymore you know.

768
00:53:48,408 --> 00:53:51,408
Scott: so you can't put more than one house per city.

769
00:53:51,971 --> 00:53:55,916
Scott: so if you've already got a house somewhere then you don't need to put a house there anymore.

770
00:53:55,997 --> 00:53:58,771
Scott: so if that you can use the city as part of a new route.

771
00:53:59,454 --> 00:54:03,292
Scott: but it won't help you put a house there because you've got one so there's no point.

772
00:54:04,297 --> 00:54:05,463
Scott: so yeah it's pretty cool.

773
00:54:05,826 --> 00:54:11,581
Scott: you're trying to get as many houses on the board as you can but sometimes you make routes where you know.

774
00:54:11,601 --> 00:54:16,110
Scott: you make a route of six cities in a row but you can only put down maybe three houses.

775
00:54:17,054 --> 00:54:17,616
Scott: so not it's.

776
00:54:17,737 --> 00:54:19,365
Scott: it's pretty easy to make big routes.

777
00:54:19,888 --> 00:54:24,697
Scott: it's difficult to make big routes where you can put down houses on every city in the route

778
00:54:25,019 --> 00:54:33,207
Rym: and while there is a lot of randomness at first like when you first start playing the game it's like you'll have a master stroke and like oh i'm getting all the cards i want.

779
00:54:33,308 --> 00:54:35,600
Rym: or uh i didn't get the cards i needed at all.

780
00:54:35,982 --> 00:54:40,383
Rym: but the randomness really is mitigated by the fact that the game is the perfect length.

781
00:54:40,584 --> 00:54:47,322
Rym: like i've never seen someone in all the times we've played it so far including myself have bad luck or good luck.

782
00:54:47,523 --> 00:54:52,490
Rym: that was not evened out by opposite luck before the end of the game and it really comes down to skill.

783
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:54,502
Rym: it's not really a random game as far as we can tell.

784
00:54:54,522 --> 00:54:58,729
Scott: i mean there was one game we played that had a big asterisk on it because we messed up a bunch of rules.

785
00:54:58,809 --> 00:54:59,494
Scott: but that doesn't count.

786
00:54:59,514 --> 00:55:01,367
Rym: yeah you and alex messed up a bunch of rules.

787
00:55:01,407 --> 00:55:03,319
Rym: yeah i was sipping wine in another room.

788
00:55:03,541 --> 00:55:06,015
Scott: yeah but every you know later on.

789
00:55:06,518 --> 00:55:07,624
Scott: it's like at first.

790
00:55:07,825 --> 00:55:14,458
Scott: i when we started playing the game and i wasn't really too good at it i kind of felt like oh i'm not getting the cards i want i lose.

791
00:55:14,639 --> 00:55:16,452
Scott: or aha i got all the cards i want.

792
00:55:16,512 --> 00:55:17,480
Scott: watch this and i would win.

793
00:55:18,261 --> 00:55:34,103
Scott: but now that we've had more experience after playing five or six games you know at one point i felt like i wasn't getting what i wanted but i still managed to pull something out that scored enough houses and points and when i did feel like i was getting everything i wanted i did.

794
00:55:34,304 --> 00:55:36,776
Scott: but it wasn't a complete blowout amazing thing.

795
00:55:36,836 --> 00:55:38,624
Scott: it was just as good as what everyone else was doing.

796
00:55:39,348 --> 00:55:41,196
Scott: so you know you might it might.

797
00:55:41,478 --> 00:55:54,920
Scott: at first when you're inexperienced luck might have a larger factor but once you know when to flush the cards down the toilet when to draw two when to draw an unknown card you know what to keep in your hand and what to play.

798
00:55:55,442 --> 00:55:58,457
Scott: the luck really kind of goes out of it and it's all about what you know.

799
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:01,830
Rym: overall it's a really good game.

800
00:56:02,313 --> 00:56:03,520
Rym: i'd recommend it as always.

801
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:08,988
Rym: it's fairly abstract and it's one of those games that isn't extremely cut and dry.

802
00:56:09,008 --> 00:56:11,022
Rym: to people who aren't used to german board games i don't think.

803
00:56:11,766 --> 00:56:12,851
Scott: yeah i don't know.

804
00:56:13,514 --> 00:56:21,284
Scott: if you're not a german board gamer you might want to still stick with like ticket to ride or something like that as an intro or settlers as the introductory.

805
00:56:21,304 --> 00:56:25,589
Rym: yeah i mean i hate to sound like one of those people like oh this is an advanced board game.

806
00:56:25,629 --> 00:56:32,659
Scott: it's not not for you it is not as advanced as you know Tigris and Euphrates or Puerto Rico or any of those really heavy games.

807
00:56:32,679 --> 00:56:40,684
Scott: so it does fill sort of that niche of the in-between like you've played the beginning german board games like Carcassonne and settlers and ticket to ride.

808
00:56:41,307 --> 00:56:42,897
Scott: but those are still.

809
00:56:43,018 --> 00:56:45,680
Scott: you know you're losing interest in them and you want something a little harder.

810
00:56:46,002 --> 00:56:47,650
Scott: but you don't need to jump off the deep end.

811
00:56:47,671 --> 00:56:50,608
Scott: i think that this game is like right in the sweet spot right

812
00:56:50,649 --> 00:57:01,279
Rym: there in fact maybe just because we played it again recently but it feels like it's at the same level of El Grande and all those because i remember we started with settlers and that was our first game and we loved it and loved it and loved it.

813
00:57:01,299 --> 00:57:12,508
Rym: and then when we when we cut our teeth and we started you know looking for better board games we moved toward Entecker and El Grande and all those games and then eventually we ended up at Puerto Rico and Tigris and Euphrates.

814
00:57:13,352 --> 00:57:29,438
Scott: something else i really like about Thurn in Texas is that not only is it two three and four player without changing any rules but if everyone is experienced setting up is really fast playing is really fast and cleaning up is really fast you can just whip this thing out like wow

815
00:57:29,518 --> 00:57:32,820
Rym: yep i mean Ra has the same advantage but Ra's not nearly as good a game.

816
00:57:32,941 --> 00:57:33,785
Scott: no Ra is more.

817
00:57:33,926 --> 00:57:34,811
Scott: Ra is fun.

818
00:57:34,831 --> 00:57:38,229
Scott: i don't know if it's as fun but Ra is much more random.

819
00:57:38,249 --> 00:57:44,560
Scott: you know this is more fun than Ra less random and you get sat you're satisfied playing it.

820
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:50,455
Scott: you know it's not too heavy not too light and it takes like a half hour.

821
00:57:50,495 --> 00:57:53,231
Scott: if everyone knows what the hell they're doing that's really cool.

822
00:57:54,176 --> 00:57:57,093
Scott: oh there are some misprints in the uh instruction book.

823
00:57:57,475 --> 00:58:00,170
Scott: not misprints like broken rules misprints like typos.

824
00:58:00,672 --> 00:58:02,885
Rym: yeah whatever i mean that's the first edition printing.

825
00:58:02,925 --> 00:58:03,288
Scott: what do you?

826
00:58:03,308 --> 00:58:16,479
Rym: yeah well also if you look at the game while the rules are printed in english the board the game itself is obviously set up to be bilingual english and german and i think that the german board gaming market in the us is strong enough now.

827
00:58:16,499 --> 00:58:21,835
Rym: i mean obviously germany's known because more and more these games are coming over here for by various means.

828
00:58:22,479 --> 00:58:36,259
Rym: but they know this game was going to be sold here and they sold it here real quick compared to how games used to come over in the past and i'll bet that they made it bilingual and all the only thing they had to reprint between the two editions now was the actual rule book.

829
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,152
Rym: yeah they saved a bunch of money the board.

830
00:58:38,394 --> 00:58:42,907
Scott: they didn't have to change the cards they didn't have to change like the rule summary card thingies.

831
00:58:43,349 --> 00:58:51,897
Scott: all they changed was the actual rule book and they designed the box and they didn't really change anything else and thus they were able to bring the game over really quickly.

832
00:58:51,958 --> 00:58:57,834
Scott: of course in the rush there are some typos in the rule book but big deal the rules are still fine as written.

833
00:58:57,854 --> 00:58:59,142
Scott: it doesn't cause a problem yep.

834
00:58:59,282 --> 00:59:06,617
Rym: and of course last and certainly least this game is one of the few german board games ever that's actually set in germany.

835
00:59:06,959 --> 00:59:12,920
Scott: yeah i was gonna mention that because it's about the german post office and how it was created and all that stuff.

836
00:59:13,061 --> 00:59:14,308
Rym: yeah we could talk about the.

837
00:59:14,449 --> 00:59:17,207
Rym: you know the the theme of the game but you guys have wikipedia.

838
00:59:17,227 --> 00:59:24,347
Scott: yeah the only real theme that the game has built in is that each city has sort of a building attached to the city.

839
00:59:24,387 --> 00:59:33,899
Scott: that is the post that you know it's like in this town the post office is in a castle and there's a picture of the castle and then there's a little guide that tells you about all the buildings.

840
00:59:33,919 --> 00:59:35,368
Scott: you know it's like oh in that city.

841
00:59:35,669 --> 00:59:47,512
Rym: yeah the post office is in the town hall you know yeah the the that part of the theme is definitely hacked on in the same way that in uh railroad tycoon they hack out all that stuff to teach you about locomotives.

842
00:59:47,673 --> 01:00:02,068
Scott: yeah there's also like uh one like page worth of information about like thurn and taxis and the people who you know the people in the olden days who actually started all this stuff and the history and it's semi interesting.

843
01:00:02,128 --> 01:00:08,500
Scott: i guess it's not like a big history lesson unless you're super interested in german post offices.

844
01:00:09,802 --> 01:00:11,469
Scott: but uh there it is all right.

845
01:00:11,770 --> 01:00:23,447
Rym: so if this snowstorm doesn't kill us all uh expect only one more normal GeekNights this week tomorrow where we'll review some form of anime manga or comic and darryl starrett will beg the question.

846
01:00:23,467 --> 01:00:26,780
Rym: oh actually i think it was gerald oh pun.

847
01:00:27,483 --> 01:00:28,989
Rym: and uh we'll have a special thursday.

848
01:00:29,230 --> 01:00:33,312
Rym: don't forget if we didn't tell the story about us trying to get home from ubercon.

849
01:00:33,332 --> 01:00:34,680
Rym: we'll make that the special on thursday.

850
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:39,890
Rym: so let us know before tomorrow because a special doesn't get recorded the day it gets put up.

851
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:42,847
Rym: a special gets recorded in advance because we're out of town.

852
01:00:42,867 --> 01:00:46,890
Scott: hey you know maybe if it actually snows tomorrow we can record everything during the day.

853
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:48,358
Scott: yeah won't that be weird?

854
01:00:48,378 --> 01:00:49,908
Scott: we won't actually be recorded at night.
