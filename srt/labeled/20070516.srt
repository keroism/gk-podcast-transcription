1
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,409
Rym: It's Wednesday May 16th.

2
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:13,532
Scott: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,873 --> 00:00:16,079
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:17,441 --> 00:00:22,360
Rym: Tonight we talk a bit about ghost in the shell standalone complex first and second gig.

5
00:00:23,903 --> 00:00:24,937
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:26,661 --> 00:00:38,219
Rym: We're running a little late tonight mostly due to the fact that there was a sudden and very intense thunderstorm Which in a very freak occurrence because this almost never happens here the trains were delayed a little bit.

7
00:00:38,883 --> 00:00:42,060
Scott: Yeah, it seems like there was some stuff that fell onto the tracks.

8
00:00:42,682 --> 00:00:44,670
Scott: So they closed all the tracks, but one.

9
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,380
Scott: so you know there's trains going north trains going south.

10
00:00:47,761 --> 00:00:59,340
Scott: They have to switch the trains onto the track that you know is okay, and then they let one train Go south and then when no trains going north can do anything and they had to stop all these trains.

11
00:00:59,501 --> 00:01:03,718
Scott: And I sat in Ossining for like a half hour around.

12
00:01:03,758 --> 00:01:09,460
Rym: yeah luckily I was out of the train and I sat at Croton Harman in a very comfortable train station for a half hour.

13
00:01:09,863 --> 00:01:12,020
Scott: I sat in a train, and I got tired.

14
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,269
Scott: I took a little nap and stopped playing my phone.

15
00:01:14,309 --> 00:01:20,060
Rym: now the best part was I didn't really care because I have my dragon book That I've been reading that Emily gave me and I was rather enjoying it.

16
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,720
Rym: So I just sat down and kept reading.

17
00:01:22,121 --> 00:01:23,063
Rym: But you could tell

18
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:23,905
Scott: people

19
00:01:23,945 --> 00:01:29,258
Rym: who commute often or commute into the city on a regular basis or who are in generally

20
00:01:29,278 --> 00:01:29,358
Scott: cool

21
00:01:30,281 --> 00:01:44,260
Rym: Affairs people who can deal with difficulty as Opposed to the people who can't because half the people who were sitting around waiting We're just sitting around waiting reading their papers whatever calling people like hey Can you pick me up in Croton Harman whatever?

22
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:51,506
Rym: But the other half of the people were either complaining loudly a train people who are just saying What do you want me to do?

23
00:01:51,526 --> 00:01:54,560
Rym: or sitting there not complaining but going?

24
00:01:57,822 --> 00:01:59,288
Scott: I just watch every five minutes.

25
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:02,579
Rym: Yeah, I'm just huffing and puffing and generally annoying me.

26
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:04,555
Scott: Yep, those people can go.

27
00:02:05,841 --> 00:02:07,607
Scott: Well, they can go do something.

28
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:11,060
Rym: Yeah now the funny thing is we were only actually delayed a half hour.

29
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,248
Rym: No big deal, but we had to get groceries tonight.

30
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:13,871
Rym: Also.

31
00:02:13,931 --> 00:02:21,171
Rym: No big deal, so we think all right Let's go to that good sushi place right next to the grocery store Get some quick sushi rolls and then get.

32
00:02:21,211 --> 00:02:21,995
Rym: take care of our business.

33
00:02:22,035 --> 00:02:23,100
Rym: come home do the show go to bed.

34
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,445
Scott: Yeah, that'll save us some time.

35
00:02:24,465 --> 00:02:25,007
Scott: No cooking.

36
00:02:25,048 --> 00:02:26,795
Scott: We'll just get some sushi rolls while we're here.

37
00:02:27,036 --> 00:02:30,200
Rym: well sadly I guess sadly for us not for the sushi place.

38
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,171
Rym: It was really crowded and it took forever for us to get our sushi.

39
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:35,560
Scott: Yeah, I didn't think it would take that long.

40
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:44,119
Scott: I thought I would sit down at the little thing and I would say give me one of those and one of those and the Guy would go And I would eat and then walk out, but that was not to be yep.

41
00:02:44,661 --> 00:02:50,880
Rym: And then we took forever grocery shopping and Scott needed a sponge for some reason as my other sponge died.

42
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:52,064
Scott: So I bought a new one.

43
00:02:52,365 --> 00:02:57,853
Rym: yeah, yeah, so now it's 10, and we're just starting the show And I'm already kind of tired.

44
00:02:57,914 --> 00:03:00,646
Rym: I'm real tired So I will see where this goes.

45
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:01,872
Scott: yeah, all right.

46
00:03:02,534 --> 00:03:05,760
Scott: There's not too much anime Comic news this week.

47
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:12,346
Scott: I mean there were these Eagle awards which are this comic awards that aren't as important as the Eisner awards And they were handed out.

48
00:03:12,446 --> 00:03:16,560
Scott: you can just go look online and see who won and determine if you agree or not whatever.

49
00:03:16,962 --> 00:03:19,333
Rym: Wow that was the laziest ass news I've ever heard.

50
00:03:19,353 --> 00:03:20,740
Scott: no no no no that's not my news.

51
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,805
Scott: That's like a sub news.

52
00:03:22,046 --> 00:03:23,573
Scott: That's why it's not the main news.

53
00:03:23,694 --> 00:03:25,722
Rym: You didn't actually say anything I know.

54
00:03:26,104 --> 00:03:30,219
Scott: I just wanted to let people know the Eagle Awards exist, and they were just awarded uh-huh.

55
00:03:31,021 --> 00:03:40,420
Scott: Anyway, my real news is that last week, or was it two weeks ago May 5th, so it was 11 days ago It's a week and a half ago was free comic book day.

56
00:03:40,983 --> 00:03:43,860
Scott: And if you were awesome you went and got free comic books.

57
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:48,598
Scott: And if you're not awesome or perhaps unlucky you did not get free comic books.

58
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:55,540
Rym: granted Not every store or comic book place has free comic book day Which we used to complain about until we realized well?

59
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,739
Rym: I guess learned that it cost the stores money to have free comic book.

60
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:06,520
Scott: yeah But when you go to a comic book store And they have free comp books they have to pay like 25 cents for each issue that they get there.

61
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:12,959
Scott: So when they have limits like two per person or when they don't carry every single one of the free comic books that are you?

62
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,565
Scott: Know on the list on the website.

63
00:04:15,007 --> 00:04:16,593
Scott: don't blame the store heck.

64
00:04:16,653 --> 00:04:19,928
Scott: if the store doesn't have any free comp books Don't blame them because I mean

65
00:04:19,947 --> 00:04:37,200
Rym: if anything free comic book day is almost like this Situation where the people who make the comic books and the publishers are almost extorting the comic book stores saying hey in Order to make our product sell better in your stores We're going to charge you money to basically pay for our promotion.

66
00:04:37,785 --> 00:04:42,228
Scott: Yeah, I don't want to get into that rant again But it seems like a large one of the.

67
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:53,040
Scott: the problem of the comic book industry in American can be summed up in that the Publishers have put all the onus onto the retailers for responsibility of sales and the retailers are not up to the challenge.

68
00:04:54,180 --> 00:05:02,811
Scott: Regardless last year we did a whole episode on the free comp books and that we got and I don't think that's necessary this year Because most of them were a yep in fact.

69
00:05:02,891 --> 00:05:06,378
Rym: I read about half of them, and I was so unimpressed I honestly just gave up.

70
00:05:06,832 --> 00:05:21,920
Scott: Yeah As far as I'm concerned if you're gonna read any of the free comp books from free comic book day The only ones really worth reading are the Mickey Mouse one which is awesome because well Mickey Mouse is awesome and the spider-man Which is surprisingly awesome?

71
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,444
Rym: I didn't read that one yet yet.

72
00:05:23,504 --> 00:05:27,578
Scott: the thing about the spider-man one that you got to understand is written by Dan slot who I?

73
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:35,422
Scott: Never heard of this guy and then someone started pimping the fact that he wrote this miniseries about the thing you know the thing for Fantastic Four.

74
00:05:35,763 --> 00:05:42,700
Scott: so I bought the trade of that miniseries, and it was so funny like it wasn't a serious superhero comic or whatever.

75
00:05:43,164 --> 00:05:45,060
Scott: It was just completely hilarious.

76
00:05:45,642 --> 00:05:58,080
Scott: so he wrote this spider-man, and I'm beginning to think that Dan slot is the Possibly one of the less than five people living who can write an enjoyable superhero comic an underwear perfect comic.

77
00:05:58,221 --> 00:06:00,149
Scott: That is funny and not crap.

78
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:05,589
Scott: so if you see a comic book written by Dan slot Easy, I think he works for Marvel, so you're not probably not gonna.

79
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:07,095
Scott: See me Dan slot DC comics.

80
00:06:07,616 --> 00:06:08,500
Scott: You should buy it.

81
00:06:08,921 --> 00:06:12,657
Scott: I'm gonna pretty much buy anything with his name on it until he proves that I shouldn't.

82
00:06:13,299 --> 00:06:17,477
Rym: yeah I. I would just like to point out the one that stood out as being particularly crap.

83
00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:21,889
Rym: Oh The transformers won the transformers one.

84
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:24,158
Rym: one was well Archie DC one.

85
00:06:24,178 --> 00:06:26,109
Rym: see Archie I don't expect anything from.

86
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:27,820
Rym: I really don't care about Archie.

87
00:06:27,961 --> 00:06:32,805
Rym: But I read the transformers one because I kind of like transformers And I figure all right.

88
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:35,260
Rym: There's the movie coming out and everything this might be cool.

89
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,780
Scott: Yeah, the transformers come because a movie prequel.

90
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:45,260
Rym: It's so lame and poorly written and poorly executed and just it's everything I hate in a comic book.

91
00:06:45,523 --> 00:06:52,471
Rym: It's trying to take itself seriously But yet at the same time the premise is pretty weak and the characters Okay, if the movie is gonna be like this.

92
00:06:52,572 --> 00:06:53,860
Scott: I don't think I want to go see it now.

93
00:06:54,262 --> 00:06:56,090
Rym: I really have almost no hope for the movie.

94
00:06:56,251 --> 00:07:01,388
Scott: my only hope for the movie was that hey It's gonna be pretty cool to see Transforming action on screen except.

95
00:07:01,428 --> 00:07:02,513
Rym: It's not cuz you know what.

96
00:07:02,854 --> 00:07:05,125
Rym: it's just gonna be the same CG We see all the time.

97
00:07:05,145 --> 00:07:07,880
Rym: We're just gonna happen to have some cachet from our childhood.

98
00:07:07,901 --> 00:07:18,820
Scott: Yeah this I just want to point out that this kind of comic this transformers comic is a lot of Independent comic publishers in America like the Battlestar Galactica comic is the same deal.

99
00:07:19,221 --> 00:07:24,677
Scott: What they're doing is in order to get people to notice them because you know they're not Marvel or DC's.

100
00:07:24,697 --> 00:07:25,800
Scott: and who buys their comics?

101
00:07:26,081 --> 00:07:26,824
Scott: Not many people.

102
00:07:27,205 --> 00:07:31,140
Scott: they go and they license properties like Battlestar Galactica.

103
00:07:31,301 --> 00:07:34,320
Scott: Oh, it's for firefly or firefly or something like that.

104
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:38,253
Scott: They get a licensed property and that way they can put their comic on the shelf.

105
00:07:38,574 --> 00:07:41,288
Scott: and even if people go who the hell is This publisher?

106
00:07:41,713 --> 00:07:46,937
Scott: they say ooh Transformers and they'll buy it anyway, and that's the way that these small comic publishers can get sales.

107
00:07:47,017 --> 00:07:50,151
Scott: the problem is They don't back it up by writing a good comic.

108
00:07:50,171 --> 00:07:52,320
Scott: They just say hey, you know it's transformers.

109
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,979
Scott: It'll sell to whoever likes transformers and no one else.

110
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,286
Scott: I mean matter how good we write.

111
00:07:56,346 --> 00:08:02,373
Rym: the firefly comic sold really well the prequel to the movie But the comic was garbage and had not nothing.

112
00:08:02,413 --> 00:08:12,920
Rym: that made firefly good was in it Yeah And the Battlestar Galactica free comic book day was garbage And it was also drawn in that muscly big-breasted women's style that I hate so much.

113
00:08:13,582 --> 00:08:16,752
Scott: The only other comic that I think is worth mentioning is the Wolfman one.

114
00:08:16,812 --> 00:08:23,980
Scott: now the thing about the Wolfman one is it's written By Robert Kirkman and Robert Kirkman is sort of this strange comic writer.

115
00:08:24,422 --> 00:08:29,300
Scott: He's written a few things and it seems like sometimes you write something, and I love it.

116
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,063
Scott: It's awesome.

117
00:08:30,303 --> 00:08:32,611
Scott: sometimes you write something and it's crap.

118
00:08:33,033 --> 00:08:33,214
Scott: like.

119
00:08:33,274 --> 00:08:46,140
Scott: he wrote the mark the recently Canceled Marvel team-up series which is awesome, and he writes walking dead which is awesome Which is the like the current number one zombie comic that keeps selling more and more copies every single month.

120
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,187
Scott: You should read walking dead.

121
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,335
Scott: if you're not reading walking dead.

122
00:08:48,356 --> 00:08:48,899
Scott: You're a fool.

123
00:08:49,465 --> 00:08:58,527
Scott: But he also writes invincible Which is a kind of crappy generic superhero comic for image this kind of bleh, and he wrote this wolf man Which is bleh.

124
00:08:58,829 --> 00:08:59,813
Rym: Yeah, it was just.

125
00:09:00,194 --> 00:09:01,460
Rym: I hate to use a word like this.

126
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:06,980
Rym: It's kind of like calling something pretentious on the internet, but I found wolf man to be very pedestrian.

127
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,600
Scott: Wolfman was indeed quite pedestrian.

128
00:09:12,081 --> 00:09:15,432
Scott: Yes, so pre comic book day, they're free.

129
00:09:15,733 --> 00:09:16,676
Scott: so who gives a shit?

130
00:09:16,977 --> 00:09:17,960
Scott: you might as well get him.

131
00:09:18,361 --> 00:09:22,835
Scott: But if you're thinking about you know purchasing any comics based upon.

132
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:29,420
Scott: You know the free ones I recommend purchasing all Mickey Mouse comics and all Dan slot comics.

133
00:09:30,243 --> 00:09:34,300
Rym: So we haven't had a lot of convention news lately even though there has been a lot of convention news.

134
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,022
Scott: Well, you know why?

135
00:09:35,082 --> 00:09:40,298
Scott: because unlike last year where we had a convention in June conventions in July convention in August.

136
00:09:40,659 --> 00:09:42,885
Scott: this year We have nothing in June.

137
00:09:43,226 --> 00:09:43,928
Scott: nothing in August.

138
00:09:44,189 --> 00:09:45,633
Scott: three conventions in July.

139
00:09:45,753 --> 00:09:47,940
Rym: Yeah one two three at least three.

140
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:52,134
Scott: If we were going to the San Diego comic-con it would be one two three four God.

141
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:52,415
Rym: and when?

142
00:09:52,435 --> 00:09:52,997
Rym: his packs?

143
00:09:53,098 --> 00:09:53,419
Rym: luckily.

144
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,650
Scott: well I guess I think the first week in August.

145
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:56,454
Scott: I'm not sure let me.

146
00:09:56,494 --> 00:09:57,680
Rym: sadly we're not going to pack.

147
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,176
Scott: Yeah, we vowed we would we vowed we would go to packs, and we vowed incorrectly.

148
00:10:02,216 --> 00:10:02,959
Scott: we were shit talkers.

149
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,909
Scott: someday It's actually gonna be August 24th.

150
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,980
Rym: Oh, I guess we could go through 2607.

151
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:12,952
Scott: Oh wow if you go to the packs website, which is penny arcade expo calm.

152
00:10:13,394 --> 00:10:20,960
Scott: There's a countdown to packs There's a live clock ticking down, and I gotta say I really like anime conventions.

153
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,190
Rym: I mean I've been going to Otakon for a long fucking time.

154
00:10:24,411 --> 00:10:25,735
Scott: God is this gonna be Otakon?

155
00:10:25,896 --> 00:10:28,910
Rym: six five Yeah, five or six for us.

156
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,317
Rym: I mean so many?

157
00:10:30,398 --> 00:10:41,580
Rym: okay I mean I went to gaming con since I was a little kid, but anime cons I never really went to him until when he were at RIT And I suddenly went to a whole bunch and I realized that I liked them.

158
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,453
Rym: I liked them a lot, and I love going to Otakon.

159
00:10:44,695 --> 00:10:45,820
Rym: I love going to Katsucon.

160
00:10:46,141 --> 00:10:52,674
Rym: I love all these anime cons, but oh with one exception Never has one of these cons said.

161
00:10:53,016 --> 00:11:03,176
Rym: by the way We're getting so and so musical act or so and so guest and I said anything other than oh cool I mean when Otakon got Laru ku I was like oh shit Wow.

162
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:07,078
Rym: but other than that I like the cons, but I never get excited about the guests.

163
00:11:08,663 --> 00:11:15,798
Scott: A couple times I might be excited about a guest like when Otakon Almost had the penny arcade guys, and then they copped out or when they had mr.

164
00:11:15,838 --> 00:11:16,240
Rym: Try gun.

165
00:11:16,764 --> 00:11:22,334
Scott: Oh, yeah, when they're the try gun guy that was pretty damn cool You know, but that's mostly because I had never really been to Otakon before.

166
00:11:22,374 --> 00:11:23,057
Scott: so what did I know?

167
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:23,760
Rym: yeah?

168
00:11:24,061 --> 00:11:26,425
Rym: But even then like the musical acts I never really care about cuz.

169
00:11:26,445 --> 00:11:29,136
Scott: I mean I like the music bar was I was all about that.

170
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:31,064
Rym: TMR was awesome But I wasn't like.

171
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:31,807
Rym: I freaked out.

172
00:11:32,088 --> 00:11:35,080
Scott: I didn't freak out, but I was pretty excited.

173
00:11:35,401 --> 00:11:44,600
Rym: But when it comes to packs they have without fail as long as packs has existed Always had musical acts to where I would have paid quite a bit of money to see them.

174
00:11:44,942 --> 00:11:45,666
Scott: Well, I think it's cuz.

175
00:11:45,686 --> 00:11:50,740
Rym: they have some of the same musical acts every year Yeah, but they're musical acts that I really would like to say.

176
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,198
Scott: You know they get your mini bosses and your MC front the lots and your MC Chris's.

177
00:11:56,278 --> 00:11:57,984
Rym: and yeah Well, I've seen MC Chris.

178
00:11:58,064 --> 00:11:59,830
Rym: Yeah, at least I've seen one down.

179
00:12:00,091 --> 00:12:03,783
Scott: Yeah, and they this year they have frickin What's the name?

180
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:04,507
Scott: freeze pop.

181
00:12:04,729 --> 00:12:12,588
Scott: you know you might know them from Guitar Hero, you know God it's a good thing.

182
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:13,373
Rym: We don't have Guitar Heroes.

183
00:12:13,394 --> 00:12:17,634
Rym: Yeah We might just have to take a week hiatus whenever we get it man.

184
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,888
Scott: I can see this gonna be crazy Oh god.

185
00:12:19,908 --> 00:12:20,674
Scott: I want to go to pack.

186
00:12:20,775 --> 00:12:21,360
Scott: so bad.

187
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,468
Scott: I feel bad that I've missed all the past.

188
00:12:23,528 --> 00:12:32,079
Scott: packs is like I was there at those concerts in spirit But at the same time I missed out on those concerts, and I can never go experience them again.

189
00:12:32,628 --> 00:12:33,160
Rym: I mean packs.

190
00:12:33,441 --> 00:12:36,051
Rym: We'll have to do a show about packs before we even go to it.

191
00:12:36,232 --> 00:12:37,095
Rym: before we go to it.

192
00:12:37,155 --> 00:12:38,440
Scott: what we expect from packs?

193
00:12:38,741 --> 00:12:40,046
Scott: We go to packs we come back.

194
00:12:40,428 --> 00:12:43,400
Scott: how we were disappointed at packs did not live up to our fantasy.

195
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,612
Scott: Dissipation is always better than the reality.

196
00:12:46,652 --> 00:12:53,095
Rym: people remember that Sometimes I've had a few cases where the opposite was true very few.

197
00:12:53,436 --> 00:12:56,285
Rym: the first anime central I went to was the exact opposite.

198
00:12:56,646 --> 00:13:02,805
Rym: my expectation was mighty low and what that con actually was was one of my greatest con Experiences ever.

199
00:13:02,946 --> 00:13:05,320
Rym: Yeah, but I digress way back.

200
00:13:05,581 --> 00:13:13,852
Rym: We got a hint ahead of time that you know Otakon's guess we're gonna be say you and they were gonna be big name say you and We just didn't get around to talking about it a lot.

201
00:13:13,872 --> 00:13:18,495
Rym: and then they announced the say you And I didn't recognize the names too much so I didn't really pay attention to it.

202
00:13:18,917 --> 00:13:29,718
Rym: and on a lark I was looking at the site and I saw that one of the guest is Tomokazu Seki a voice actor and I saw that the list of things he has done is very long.

203
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:37,118
Rym: and Then I noticed that he's in initial D and he's in eska flown a and he's in this giant list of anime.

204
00:13:37,499 --> 00:13:51,220
Rym: that Reminded me very much of another certain voice actors list and I thought for a second Oh shit Is this the man that guy whose name I always forget my second favorite voice actor in the world the guy who plays?

205
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:57,679
Rym: Takahashi Ryosuke in initial D who plays every suave cool guy in every anime ever.

206
00:13:58,343 --> 00:14:00,620
Rym: No, that man is Takahito Koyasu.

207
00:14:01,601 --> 00:14:13,076
Rym: But Tomokazu Seki is none other than the voice of Takahashi Keisuke Ryosuke's brother Oh snaps and he's a voice actor of equal caliber.

208
00:14:13,397 --> 00:14:19,920
Rym: and just as The former guy plays all those cool suave hip to the ladies be shown in characters.

209
00:14:20,361 --> 00:14:26,980
Rym: This guy plays the punk kind of not necessarily young kids, but Punk spiky haired prickly character.

210
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,630
Scott: Yeah, all the blonde spiky haired guys, like he plays Nobu and Nana.

211
00:14:32,731 --> 00:14:36,367
Scott: Yeah, and he plays Isaac in Gundam C.

212
00:14:36,467 --> 00:14:39,435
Rym: Yeah, and while Vaughn isn't a while Vaughn isn't blonde.

213
00:14:39,475 --> 00:14:41,579
Rym: He's definitely spiky haired and prickly Yep.

214
00:14:42,303 --> 00:14:51,540
Scott: So I think that if you had both of these guys together at one Convention like the world would implode at the double combination of voice acting awesomeness.

215
00:14:51,721 --> 00:15:04,820
Rym: It's amazing how the more I pay attention to voice actors I think back to characters that I thought were voice acted really well and I start to notice that all the characters I liked were all done by a relatively small number of people.

216
00:15:05,562 --> 00:15:10,780
Scott: Yeah, there's only like five less than ten people out there who do all the awesome voice acting most of it.

217
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,084
Scott: Anyway, at least in anime.

218
00:15:12,525 --> 00:15:14,251
Rym: Well in anime in Japan.

219
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:14,652
Rym: Yes.

220
00:15:14,752 --> 00:15:19,240
Rym: Yes, cuz if we're talking about English voice acting I guess you're assuming that there's good voice acting.

221
00:15:20,782 --> 00:15:22,207
Scott: I hope no voice actors listening.

222
00:15:22,227 --> 00:15:23,813
Scott: They're gonna be like, oh that was cold.

223
00:15:23,953 --> 00:15:25,519
Rym: You know what it should be cold.

224
00:15:25,699 --> 00:15:33,179
Rym: granted I don't actually blame them because as Emily pointed out we were talking about this one day and She kind of I mean, we don't obviously know how they do it.

225
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:37,980
Rym: But she said that we could probably blame the ADR people a lot more than the actual actors.

226
00:15:38,251 --> 00:15:51,680
Scott: Yeah We could probably blame the ADR people a lot more than the actors and also it seems that there are depending on which Studio is hired to do the dubbing like the expensive and fancy dubbing studios Like there's a few of them out there that seem to always do a good job.

227
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,959
Scott: You know the people who do the ghost in the shell and the cowboy bebop and all that's like the same.

228
00:15:56,442 --> 00:15:59,280
Scott: Say that's that one studio doing all those good ones.

229
00:15:59,341 --> 00:16:00,659
Scott: Why don't they do everything else?

230
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:06,549
Scott: Because they cost a lot of money and they actually take their time to do a good job instead of doing a rush job to Get it done.

231
00:16:06,915 --> 00:16:19,386
Rym: God I mean while with the whole anime industry people always talk about we want to pay less to get more I would actually pay more to get actual good dubs If everything was done was a dub.

232
00:16:19,407 --> 00:16:30,140
Scott: if you made a dub that I could prefer to the subs You know like the cowboy bebop dub Which I prefer to the sub or I would pay five bucks more per disc to get a dub that I preferred to the subs.

233
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:30,602
Scott: It's gonna be.

234
00:16:30,924 --> 00:16:33,617
Scott: I could not have to pay so much attention when I watch it.

235
00:16:33,939 --> 00:16:36,713
Rym: Yep I mean you can't play Pokemon while you're watching a fan sub.

236
00:16:36,773 --> 00:16:37,336
Rym: That's right.

237
00:16:37,618 --> 00:16:38,020
Scott: That's right.

238
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:54,740
Rym: And also since we're talking a little bit about convention news This is all I mean not set in stone But I'd just like to mention it that if any of you want to see us live and you want to see us do Awesome things at a convention you want to see us do panels you want to see us run game shows you want to see us?

239
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,985
Rym: BMC's or whatever.

240
00:16:56,468 --> 00:17:05,348
Rym: well if you go to ConnectiCon this year Or if you go to the New York anime festival this year And there's a decent chance if you go to Otakon this year.

241
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:08,540
Rym: You're gonna see us do quite a bit.

242
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:16,574
Scott: We're gonna be you like if you thought it was good last year when we you know We had a video a game show here or a panel there.

243
00:17:17,156 --> 00:17:18,039
Scott: You ain't seen nothing.

244
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,180
Scott: yet.

245
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:22,880
Scott: You're gonna see us lose our voices Friday night after doing like 10 panels or whatever.

246
00:17:22,944 --> 00:17:32,225
Rym: Yeah Cuz I basically I mean we break up the duties of GeekNights And I'm effectively like the producer and like the PR guy and Scott does a lot of the computer stuff And he's like our art director or whatever.

247
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:38,385
Rym: so uh I spent the last several weeks working with various conventions and doing my annual You know.

248
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:40,156
Rym: hey conventions blah blah blah.

249
00:17:40,196 --> 00:17:40,820
Rym: Here's my resume.

250
00:17:41,022 --> 00:17:41,586
Rym: What do we do?

251
00:17:41,606 --> 00:17:43,340
Rym: we work stuff out and this year?

252
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:57,198
Rym: I was going over all the things we've been confirmed to do and all the things cons have asked us to do and I Realized that we're going to have to probably at some cons Not talk outside of our events because we will not have voices.

253
00:17:57,258 --> 00:18:03,679
Scott: otherwise We'll be sitting our artist alley table with like pictochats like waving at you like we're really.

254
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:08,420
Rym: basically We're going to a lot fewer cons this year, but we're hitting those cons a hundred times harder.

255
00:18:08,761 --> 00:18:10,710
Scott: We are hitting them like a hundred times harder.

256
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:13,140
Scott: There is no doubt, but I don't think we're going to a lot fewer.

257
00:18:13,241 --> 00:18:18,731
Scott: I think we're going to like one or two fewer and Because three of them are squished into one month.

258
00:18:18,811 --> 00:18:20,519
Scott: It feels like we're going to allow you.

259
00:18:20,539 --> 00:18:20,942
Rym: well Let's see.

260
00:18:20,982 --> 00:18:23,940
Rym: I mean I backed out of an amazement because I'm overworked.

261
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,964
Rym: I spent a lot of money.

262
00:18:25,024 --> 00:18:25,686
Scott: one convention.

263
00:18:25,867 --> 00:18:30,546
Scott: You didn't go to torque on that's - one can there was no ubercon It's - two three.

264
00:18:30,606 --> 00:18:32,855
Rym: We're not going back to Philly wizard world.

265
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:33,940
Scott: that doesn't really count.

266
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,782
Rym: We went though.

267
00:18:35,103 --> 00:18:37,070
Rym: we went and those six hours.

268
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:38,434
Rym: I could have spent on the beach.

269
00:18:38,915 --> 00:18:40,460
Rym: Yeah, those are beach hours.

270
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,224
Rym: I won't get back.

271
00:18:41,244 --> 00:18:42,449
Scott: It was a learning experience.

272
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:42,791
Rym: Yes.

273
00:18:42,851 --> 00:18:43,193
Rym: It was.

274
00:18:43,253 --> 00:18:44,700
Rym: don't go to Philly wizard world.

275
00:18:45,122 --> 00:18:47,392
Scott: Actually, there's a funny thing happening this year.

276
00:18:47,412 --> 00:18:49,962
Scott: whether you realize it or not you probably don't care Which is why I don't know.

277
00:18:50,323 --> 00:19:04,916
Scott: but Philly wizard world a comic convention right and heroes con another comic convention, which are Relatively in in close proximity are being held on the same weekend And they're having sort of this battle to see which one it holds up.

278
00:19:05,257 --> 00:19:08,025
Rym: That's Crazy and stupid.

279
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:17,100
Scott: I don't know which con set their date when but neither one of them is changing and comic fans everywhere deciding Am I gonna go to heroes con or am I gonna go to Philly wizard world?

280
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,063
Scott: Which one's it gonna be?

281
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:23,020
Scott: and I have a feeling that one of these cards might not do so well as the other.

282
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:38,499
Rym: Well, the thing is that's not what you want to do to your fan community because especially when comic books in America I mean non-manga, but like a straight-up superhero kind of comic books, even if you like them It's not as though they're doing very well.

283
00:19:39,013 --> 00:19:49,604
Rym: Yep I mean not compared to pretty much any other printed media in the US and the last thing you want to do is Cripple one of the conventions you've got left Yep.

284
00:19:49,985 --> 00:19:59,036
Scott: Yeah, the Philly wizard world is June 15th through 17th And of course Philly and heroes con is June 15th through 17th in Charlotte, North Carolina.

285
00:19:59,197 --> 00:20:00,240
Scott: Not too far apart.

286
00:20:00,842 --> 00:20:02,347
Rym: It's further apart than I expected.

287
00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:03,993
Rym: I was getting the impression.

288
00:20:04,013 --> 00:20:10,678
Scott: It was like once in East Philly once in West Philly No, but like I I know comic fans in Philly who are like we're going to heroes con bitches.

289
00:20:10,698 --> 00:20:12,985
Scott: Wow Cuz they're.

290
00:20:13,025 --> 00:20:15,380
Scott: they're supporting that instead of the crap Philly wizard world.

291
00:20:15,661 --> 00:20:19,440
Rym: But the point is we'll have more details once we work them out.

292
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:25,740
Rym: But if you go to the anime cons that we go to this year, you can expect us to be doing a lot.

293
00:20:26,501 --> 00:20:35,780
Rym: Yep, bring your friends things of the day.

294
00:20:36,243 --> 00:20:38,440
Rym: Well, I was pining looking for a thing of the day.

295
00:20:38,841 --> 00:20:51,123
Rym: I noticed that our friend I do had emailed me a bunch of cool things and one of these things I Could not pass up because I had not seen it and I believe she found it by accident while researching something else and it's pretty Damn, cool.

296
00:20:51,405 --> 00:20:54,500
Rym: It also happens to be subtitled so you can watch it straight up.

297
00:20:55,040 --> 00:21:03,472
Rym: Apparently in the 80s someone made a comic called Valhalla And it is a Danish comic about if you couldn't guess the Norse gods.

298
00:21:03,854 --> 00:21:05,459
Scott: Oh Danish comic you say.

299
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:10,440
Rym: well Someone has or at least it was the Danish comic or Danish cartoon adaptation of the comics.

300
00:21:10,521 --> 00:21:17,760
Scott: They might both be Danish See I likes me some European comics like some tin tins and some asterix is but they're pretty hard to get in English.

301
00:21:18,081 --> 00:21:28,349
Rym: well, very simply my thing of the day is a link to the video on YouTube of this Adaptation of this comic and it's pretty damn cool.

302
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:30,757
Rym: And I really like Loki.

303
00:21:31,158 --> 00:21:31,820
Rym: What can I say?

304
00:21:32,441 --> 00:21:38,458
Scott: Yeah, I watched this for like a minute or two and it was pretty weird seeing an animation with I guess

305
00:21:38,879 --> 00:21:39,160
Rym: Dutch

306
00:21:39,744 --> 00:21:51,281
Scott: Being spoken because it's not a language I hear often like when I first started watching anime with subtitles like hearing Japanese is weird But now hearing Japanese is natural, but hearing Dutch was weird I

307
00:21:51,722 --> 00:21:51,963
Rym: don't know.

308
00:21:52,003 --> 00:21:57,162
Scott: to me it fit really well because it felt like it did fit but it stood out to me like I was It would.

309
00:21:57,283 --> 00:22:03,140
Scott: it was like sticking out and I noticed it and I would have had to watch probably the whole thing before I wouldn't notice it anymore.

310
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:05,520
Scott: But yeah, it definitely looked really cool.

311
00:22:05,701 --> 00:22:09,580
Scott: And if I had some time to watch things like that, I would totally watch this dude.

312
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,285
Rym: The first half is like 10 minutes long.

313
00:22:11,326 --> 00:22:11,927
Rym: Just watch it.

314
00:22:11,948 --> 00:22:13,713
Scott: I might I might.

315
00:22:14,095 --> 00:22:16,543
Scott: it depends five time All right.

316
00:22:17,265 --> 00:22:18,610
Scott: So what's GeekNights.

317
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:21,118
Scott: GeekNights is a late show, but for geeks.

318
00:22:21,178 --> 00:22:27,778
Scott: well There are other late shows out there where you know, we got our late show ideas from but not geek ideas from.

319
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:32,594
Rym: not Terribly much so not really because I've lost.

320
00:22:32,634 --> 00:22:34,280
Scott: see what we have in common is that we're late.

321
00:22:34,802 --> 00:22:38,240
Rym: I've watched a lot of late shows and I don't find them funny at all.

322
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,339
Rym: No late shows are mostly David Letterman just isn't funny.

323
00:22:41,589 --> 00:22:43,411
Rym: No And he's not all those other.

324
00:22:43,753 --> 00:22:47,249
Rym: none of them are funny at all Like their jokes are so predictable and crap.

325
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:53,091
Rym: and even you know, this is probably blast me to a lot of people But people always talk about yeah, Johnny Carson.

326
00:22:53,132 --> 00:22:54,598
Rym: He was the best entertainer ever.

327
00:22:54,738 --> 00:22:55,120
Rym: It's great.

328
00:22:55,541 --> 00:23:06,374
Rym: The show with Johnny Carson was like this amazing thing and I've watched a ton of episodes of Johnny Carson's show And uh, I don't think I laughed more than once or twice at all.

329
00:23:06,695 --> 00:23:07,960
Rym: I just didn't really find it funny.

330
00:23:08,281 --> 00:23:09,726
Rym: Yeah, I like Johnny Carson.

331
00:23:09,746 --> 00:23:13,700
Rym: I like the things he says and does but I don't like his show.

332
00:23:14,162 --> 00:23:31,160
Scott: I think the thing about a lot of those late night shows is that they're sort of like the only sort of thing that we have that can be called say a variety show and Usually if anything's gonna be funny on the show It's when some you know, someone trying to break into the entertainment business comes on the show and they're actually good.

333
00:23:31,491 --> 00:23:31,820
Scott: You know like.

334
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:41,248
Scott: you'll always watch clips of people who are super famous now and how they got their start on like The Tonight Show or something and That original thing they did was really funny.

335
00:23:41,268 --> 00:23:44,398
Rym: I wish we could just have variety shows without David Letterman.

336
00:23:44,418 --> 00:23:57,712
Scott: in my way yeah, but regardless David Letterman did a little bit here and Basically he sent his crew out into the city because he's in New York City and They got a bunch of people in spider-man costumes to sort of flash mob.

337
00:23:57,772 --> 00:24:03,071
Scott: this Jamba Juice Jamba Juice is a chain of Basically juice stores in the city where you get juice.

338
00:24:03,292 --> 00:24:04,015
Rym: They're pretty cool.

339
00:24:04,055 --> 00:24:05,160
Rym: I really like they're okay.

340
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:09,458
Scott: the only thing I don't like about them is that the juices are sometimes a little thick and I can't finish them.

341
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:16,825
Scott: and Also, they put these BS like booster herbal crap thingies in your juice And I always tell them not to put that in there.

342
00:24:17,006 --> 00:24:18,390
Rym: RIT always had that too.

343
00:24:18,631 --> 00:24:20,798
Scott: Yeah, like the medRx whatever like.

344
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:25,132
Scott: yeah I'm sure that that powder you're gonna put in my juice is gonna make my memory better.

345
00:24:25,152 --> 00:24:25,815
Scott: Yeah.

346
00:24:25,995 --> 00:24:26,396
Scott: Okay.

347
00:24:26,537 --> 00:24:27,500
Scott: Keep it to yourself, man.

348
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,480
Scott: But it's pretty funny because see all these people dressed up as spider-man go into the Jamba Juice.

349
00:24:33,164 --> 00:24:38,509
Scott: But I don't want to talk about the people dressed as spider-man going to the Jamba Juice That's that's not really, you know that funny.

350
00:24:38,589 --> 00:24:41,280
Scott: I mean we see stuff like that on the internet every goddamn day.

351
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,286
Scott: Maybe it's a normal people.

352
00:24:42,306 --> 00:24:50,564
Scott: that's funny, but to us whatever He does send in like a Superman later in the video and like a Moses or something But whatever.

353
00:24:50,986 --> 00:24:54,660
Scott: but I want to point out is that they got a camera pointed at a Jamba Juice.

354
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,545
Scott: They got the costume.

355
00:24:55,565 --> 00:24:58,059
Scott: people going in the Jamba Juice, but it's New York City.

356
00:24:58,281 --> 00:25:02,360
Scott: It's a sidewalk and normal people are still walking down the street as normal.

357
00:25:02,922 --> 00:25:09,492
Scott: And I want you to look at the way New Yorkers react to seeing a bunch of spider-men in a Jamba Juice They sent up.

358
00:25:09,512 --> 00:25:15,400
Scott: they look at it Definitely they turn their heads and notice it but they keep walking and going about their business.

359
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:21,585
Scott: No one stops and stares like one guy in the Jamba Juice takes a few pictures of the cell cam But that's about it.

360
00:25:22,207 --> 00:25:24,095
Rym: And you know, all that guy did was when he got home.

361
00:25:24,135 --> 00:25:26,979
Rym: He said hey check it out There's a bunch of spider-man at my Jamba Juice.

362
00:25:27,562 --> 00:25:29,689
Scott: Yeah, that's the way New Yorkers are.

363
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:30,953
Scott: shit doesn't phase them.

364
00:25:30,973 --> 00:25:37,420
Rym: Compare that to whenever there's a flash mob I don't know almost anywhere else in America where usually the police show up right away.

365
00:25:37,501 --> 00:25:44,739
Scott: There's a giant crowd and people are yelling Yeah Imagine if this happened in a place in like a suburban town and like the grocery store.

366
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,284
Scott: People be freaking out.

367
00:25:46,304 --> 00:25:47,208
Scott: it'd be like holy shit.

368
00:25:47,228 --> 00:25:47,629
Scott: Look at that.

369
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:50,038
Scott: Oh, but just spider-man in the grocery store.

370
00:25:50,078 --> 00:25:53,130
Rym: Holy crap I guess part of it's that in New York City.

371
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:55,460
Rym: I walk past stuff like that every day and I don't even blink.

372
00:25:55,771 --> 00:26:07,431
Rym: Yeah I mean the one time that we were given pause was that time in Chinatown where there were people selling questionable meat out of a Obviously blood-soaked cardboard box in an alley.

373
00:26:07,692 --> 00:26:15,540
Scott: I saw when I was at the Chipotle like last week We saw a guy carrying two bags of what was obviously meat into the Chinese restaurant across the way.

374
00:26:16,304 --> 00:26:19,480
Rym: I once was walking with Emily in Manhattan and it was night.

375
00:26:19,641 --> 00:26:20,987
Rym: I tried to take a picture but I couldn't.

376
00:26:21,389 --> 00:26:32,956
Rym: there was a guy riding a bicycle and While riding the bicycle he was holding not one but two garbage cans on wheels Kind of tied together like next to him kind of pushing him along in the street.

377
00:26:33,538 --> 00:26:37,737
Rym: Wow I was so expecting that man to die in front of me, but no he didn't.

378
00:26:37,757 --> 00:26:41,119
Rym: he just kept going Good for him through a red light and then he was off.

379
00:26:42,681 --> 00:26:47,647
Scott: So for all of those of you who are sheltered and such Behold, New York.

380
00:26:47,707 --> 00:26:48,291
Scott: It exists.

381
00:26:48,352 --> 00:26:49,419
Scott: This is what the people are like.

382
00:26:49,801 --> 00:26:52,710
Rym: I guess the answer is no one cares about you in New York.

383
00:26:53,332 --> 00:26:54,416
Scott: That's exactly right.

384
00:26:54,576 --> 00:26:55,560
Scott: Even if you're spider-man.

385
00:26:56,321 --> 00:26:58,819
Rym: So, uh ghost in the shell standalone complex.

386
00:26:59,602 --> 00:27:00,866
Scott: Yeah, we talked.

387
00:27:00,886 --> 00:27:01,789
Scott: see I looked cuz.

388
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:05,380
Scott: I thought we talked about this before on the show and that is technically true.

389
00:27:05,601 --> 00:27:13,690
Scott: I searched the archives for ghost in the shell and apparently in 2005 we talked about ghost in the shell second gig.

390
00:27:14,111 --> 00:27:15,215
Rym: Yes, which we?

391
00:27:15,316 --> 00:27:16,560
Rym: when did we finish watching it?

392
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,062
Rym: I don't know.

393
00:27:17,445 --> 00:27:19,559
Rym: just now not too long ago.

394
00:27:19,801 --> 00:27:24,440
Scott: So it takes us two hours to watch it 22 years to watch a 26 episode anime.

395
00:27:25,441 --> 00:27:26,485
Rym: Well, I think part of it was.

396
00:27:26,525 --> 00:27:39,119
Rym: we got the first DVD and we watched it up to the kind of cliffhanger at the End of the DVD and then we realized that the not only did the rest of the DVDs not even have dates yet But the second DVD was nowhere near coming out Yep.

397
00:27:39,321 --> 00:27:46,113
Scott: So it took two years for the rest of the show to come out and for us to watch to watch it all and then Make an episode about it's kind of like my thing of the day yesterday.

398
00:27:46,435 --> 00:27:54,280
Scott: Rym weights Rym does wait but in this case Rym no longer has to wait and your patience was rewarded with the great anime.

399
00:27:54,741 --> 00:28:07,537
Rym: now I don't really want to talk about the plot of ghost in the shell standalone complex and I don't really want to bother Distinguishing too much between first gig and second gig or the Tajikamatic days, which aren't really a separate show.

400
00:28:07,577 --> 00:28:10,102
Rym: They're just awesome Yep but I think more.

401
00:28:10,122 --> 00:28:24,608
Rym: I'd like to talk about why I like ghost in the shell standalone complex because what it is is Really good, and I also would highly recommend that anyone regardless of whether or not you like anime Check out ghost in the shell standalone complex.

402
00:28:24,648 --> 00:28:26,394
Rym: just watch first gig and then second gig.

403
00:28:26,695 --> 00:28:30,186
Scott: you should also whether you like comics or not the first manga.

404
00:28:30,267 --> 00:28:40,510
Scott: you should read not so much the other ones, but definitely read the first manga and See the first movie, but the second movie is good But you might not enjoy it if you don't enjoy this sort of thing.

405
00:28:40,671 --> 00:28:46,760
Rym: now a funny little bit that I would like to point Out because I talked to anime world order about this and Scott laughed at me.

406
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:59,820
Rym: It was a while ago, but while we were starting to watch second gig I made some comment like Man, you know, I love oshi and all this but I gotta say I think he's doing standalone complex differently.

407
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:05,077
Rym: Look, it's not like he normally does stuff and Scott says that's cuz he didn't do standalone complex.

408
00:29:05,518 --> 00:29:06,160
Scott: That's right.

409
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:11,696
Rym: Yeah, ghost in the shell standalone complex is done by Kenji Kamiyama and not Mamoru.

410
00:29:11,856 --> 00:29:24,320
Scott: Oh, she yep Yeah, basically ghost in the shell has manga movies and TV shows and there's two TV shows And the first one is standalone complex and the second one is standalone complex.

411
00:29:24,841 --> 00:29:25,382
Scott: second gig.

412
00:29:25,763 --> 00:29:34,206
Rym: now the general way to put all this together because the world is kind of contiguous and kind of in order but not Officially.

413
00:29:34,227 --> 00:29:35,799
Rym: all can and linked together.

414
00:29:36,222 --> 00:29:44,509
Rym: But basically the manga is like the real deal in terms of story Like the manga is beginning to end the ghost in the shell story like the core.

415
00:29:44,769 --> 00:29:52,508
Rym: Mm-hmm What were these people doing for the many years before?

416
00:29:52,949 --> 00:30:03,300
Rym: and it goes right up through until the end of second gig is Pretty much right at the beginning of the manga as far as plot would go as far as continuity would go.

417
00:30:03,681 --> 00:30:07,995
Scott: Yep, I mean think about any police movie you've ever seen right?

418
00:30:08,477 --> 00:30:26,919
Scott: Just pick a police movie I don't care which one and it's always like some amazing incredible crime that the police have to solve, you know Over the course of a career of police people a police station that only happens a few times and All the other years and years where they're just working being normal police go by.

419
00:30:26,979 --> 00:30:34,300
Scott: well This the standalone complex the standalone complex second gig are sort of like hey, what did section 9?

420
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:39,280
Scott: You know the police group that is the focus of the ghost and most of the ghost in the shell stories.

421
00:30:39,968 --> 00:30:40,939
Scott: What were they doing?

422
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,539
Scott: Most of those normal years they were just doing police work.

423
00:30:44,961 --> 00:30:46,365
Scott: Of course, these are.

424
00:30:46,385 --> 00:30:51,480
Scott: there are specific cases that they get into that are slightly larger than you know.

425
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,524
Scott: The day-to-day stuff.

426
00:30:52,585 --> 00:30:55,999
Scott: but most of the episodes are day-to-day police action.

427
00:30:56,581 --> 00:31:07,020
Rym: Granted it's day-to-day police action of a semi secret reports to the Prime Minister Semi militarized it's like this paramilitary super secret double police.

428
00:31:07,802 --> 00:31:10,190
Rym: So they really go only go after the big things to begin with.

429
00:31:10,251 --> 00:31:21,200
Rym: but I mean their equivalent of a mugger is yeah We just stopped a multinational terrorist network from attacking Again, no biggie now in terms of how they actually flow.

430
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:33,448
Rym: I mean, we're not gonna turn this into the ghost in the shell episode But if you rank them in terms of seriousness and cerebral miss versus just fun and action and humor There is a distinct line because

431
00:31:33,849 --> 00:31:34,009
Scott: at the

432
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:41,280
Rym: bottom would be the manga which while it's very serious and cerebral It's also really kind of goony and funny and has some slapstick in it.

433
00:31:41,762 --> 00:31:45,340
Scott: The manga is actually well, it's very shirotastic in that way.

434
00:31:45,701 --> 00:31:47,127
Rym: Oh, it's sure which has him.

435
00:31:47,348 --> 00:31:49,396
Rym: we could do a whole episode explaining exactly what that.

436
00:31:49,416 --> 00:31:53,853
Scott: it's also very Tezuka ish in that you have this serious story that you are telling.

437
00:31:53,893 --> 00:32:07,467
Scott: but even at the most serious moments You're like up wacky SD character saying something funny or OMG, something cute randomly like when they put the car bomb in Aramaki's car.

438
00:32:07,528 --> 00:32:10,647
Rym: I Don't remember that in the manga.

439
00:32:10,667 --> 00:32:11,590
Rym: I don't remember.

440
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:14,901
Rym: they get mad at him and they blow up his car and then I don't remember That.

441
00:32:14,981 --> 00:32:15,644
Scott: well, okay.

442
00:32:15,765 --> 00:32:17,332
Scott: Yeah, I could I could imagine it.

443
00:32:17,754 --> 00:32:25,000
Scott: I had to read manga again, I guess Meanwhile, the movies are like dead serious without any humor whatsoever.

444
00:32:25,273 --> 00:32:47,640
Rym: Yeah I mean actually a lot of people sadly didn't really like the second ghost in the shell movie innocence because it was primarily People just talking philosophy and quoting old books while they walked around and there wasn't a lot of action and there wasn't all the stuff that people expect from ghost in the shell of guns and boobs and things exploding and procedural crime drama.

445
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,166
Rym: It was just quote.

446
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:54,459
Rym: that's meaningful quote that's meaningful Funny quote that's meaningful.

447
00:32:55,024 --> 00:32:59,387
Rym: slow scene of Bato walking Incredible CG imagery.

448
00:32:59,488 --> 00:33:00,452
Scott: that is meaningful.

449
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:01,155
Rym: Yes.

450
00:33:01,456 --> 00:33:06,340
Rym: It was a very intellectual exercise and not very much a visceral exercise.

451
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:08,350
Scott: So standalone complex.

452
00:33:08,391 --> 00:33:26,820
Scott: the two TV shows are basically if you took the ghost in the shell universe and everything that fans really like about it and you boil it down and can use it in such a way to Basically tickle the fans and it's not fans service in the way that you know.

453
00:33:28,043 --> 00:33:28,444
Scott: I don't know.

454
00:33:28,545 --> 00:33:37,298
Scott: having a Gundam fight Voltron is fan service But it is very in service to the fans without being fan service.

455
00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:56,655
Rym: Yep I mean basically it doesn't alter the world too much but what it does is you get to see all these characters interacting with each other a lot more than you see in the movies or even in the manga and Even independent of that because while that's interesting the characters themselves don't matter nearly so much as the plots they are unraveling

456
00:33:57,016 --> 00:33:57,257
Scott: and it's

457
00:33:57,317 --> 00:34:01,159
Rym: primarily an Action mystery kind of show.

458
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:08,600
Scott: Yep, you've got it's got all the elements that basically create entertainment without being too cerebral or too corny.

459
00:34:09,042 --> 00:34:14,141
Scott: You've got you know, you got the tachikomas to bring in some comedy relief, you know You've got.

460
00:34:14,181 --> 00:34:20,580
Rym: yet at the same time the cut tachikomas provide probably the greatest drama in all of standalone complex.

461
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:25,797
Scott: You've got a great varied and interesting cast of characters for you to identify with and love.

462
00:34:26,318 --> 00:34:30,094
Scott: you've got Incredible action scenes of super awesomeness.

463
00:34:30,618 --> 00:34:32,927
Rym: You've got Absolutely amazing music.

464
00:34:33,188 --> 00:34:33,429
Scott: Yep.

465
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:48,900
Scott: You've got a lot a a in-depth and complicated mysterious plot with things to be revealed that is very Interesting and is all sorts of good stuff going on and you get a piece here and a piece there and it drags you long.

466
00:34:49,382 --> 00:34:53,860
Scott: You've got police procedural action, you know, you see police investigating things.

467
00:34:54,641 --> 00:34:59,338
Scott: You've also got the cerebral stuff like oh, what's this weird thing going on in this episode?

468
00:34:59,458 --> 00:34:59,900
Scott: I don't know.

469
00:35:00,961 --> 00:35:02,766
Scott: Yeah, oh, it's supposed to mean something.

470
00:35:02,806 --> 00:35:07,680
Scott: Look at that symbolism there with those paper crane granted in second gig.

471
00:35:08,001 --> 00:35:14,360
Rym: There is one scene where normally the symbolism and when things like that happened was generally very subtle and well done.

472
00:35:14,701 --> 00:35:22,469
Rym: But there is one scene and those of you who've seen all of standalone complex will know exactly what I'm talking about Where Bob someone is talking to some

473
00:35:22,549 --> 00:35:23,212
Scott: of that one

474
00:35:23,352 --> 00:35:37,734
Rym: and they mentioned bottles name and then it cuts to bottle and he is holding a piece of wreckage from a building on his shoulder and it is exactly in the shape of a cross and He's screaming.

475
00:35:37,795 --> 00:35:42,920
Scott: So That's like the only time that the show used the symbolisms like heavy-handedly.

476
00:35:43,202 --> 00:35:44,027
Rym: It was so.

477
00:35:44,047 --> 00:35:49,579
Rym: it was almost painful the way it hit you But yet it was beautifully animated and that almost made up for it.

478
00:35:49,941 --> 00:35:53,820
Rym: But it reminded me a lot of way back when I was bored and let working for IBM.

479
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:57,820
Rym: I drove back to Rochester a lot to hang out with like my friend Kate my friend amber and all these people.

480
00:35:58,381 --> 00:36:00,186
Rym: So we I swear this is related.

481
00:36:00,547 --> 00:36:10,080
Rym: So we watched this god-awful movie called boxing Helena or boxing Helena All right, and I'm pretty sure it was a fetish softcore pornography flick.

482
00:36:10,562 --> 00:36:15,280
Rym: But we didn't realize that at the time and it was really creepy and it's a messed up movie.

483
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:16,416
Rym: I don't recommend watching it.

484
00:36:17,001 --> 00:36:38,295
Rym: but there is a scene where something's happening and basically a character is being trapped by society by herself and Physically because the dude cut off your arms and legs huh, and it flashes for a second to a birdcage and there's a bird in the cage freaking out and then it Flashes back to the girl and me and amber simultaneously turned each other and go.

485
00:36:41,108 --> 00:36:44,850
Scott: Symbolism Wow, that's equally heavy-handed right there.

486
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:47,659
Scott: I need to see it to recognize it was hilarious.

487
00:36:49,584 --> 00:37:00,910
Rym: But yeah other than that one moment The shows are really really good and even that moment the animation and the story and the emotion really kind of offset that One minor drop into cheesiness.

488
00:37:01,512 --> 00:37:08,094
Scott: I think the other thing about ghost in the shell Especially standalone conflicts is that it it seems to have something for everyone.

489
00:37:08,174 --> 00:37:11,906
Scott: unless you want, you know Wow, I guess it even does have that.

490
00:37:11,946 --> 00:37:13,311
Scott: it's like if you're a pervert.

491
00:37:13,411 --> 00:37:15,539
Scott: Well, some of the female characters are hot.

492
00:37:15,559 --> 00:37:20,094
Scott: if You want to see lots of shooting and guns you're gonna see that too.

493
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:24,322
Scott: If you want funny robots You're gonna see that - you want science fiction You're gonna see that.

494
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:34,480
Rym: - if you want political drama like straight-up hardcore political drama and political theory if you want Sci-fi about the nature of consciousness and the internet you want philosophical debates.

495
00:37:34,801 --> 00:37:42,697
Rym: It's all in there and each bit is done well enough to where if you don't like that thing You're still drawn on by the rest of it and it doesn't detract.

496
00:37:43,019 --> 00:37:50,683
Scott: Yeah I just happen to like like a human interest story as human interest stories and like in some of the episodes It's it.

497
00:37:50,744 --> 00:37:54,020
Scott: Wow, it really is sort of like the everyone show when you think about it.

498
00:37:54,180 --> 00:38:00,364
Rym: Now one thing that I really find interesting is that now I'm not gonna say I'm gonna call him get sack instead of ghost in The shell standalone complex.

499
00:38:00,464 --> 00:38:01,247
Rym: Yeah from now on.

500
00:38:01,628 --> 00:38:18,440
Rym: but in the first one, you know first gig the first get sack The plot basically was broken up into two kinds of episodes and they'd have these standalone episodes that were just a standalone Unrelated story in this world where the team busts something up or something happened.

501
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:24,480
Scott: Yeah Like there'd be an episode like Bato catches a bad guy and it would have nothing to do with the plot whatsoever.

502
00:38:25,001 --> 00:38:34,909
Rym: And it was a lot like cowboy bebop where at the same time occasionally there would be the complex episodes that all strung together form the overarching plot.

503
00:38:34,929 --> 00:38:40,706
Scott: and So like how in cowboy bebop if you watch episodes 5 I think 13 14 25 26 and maybe another one a few others.

504
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:49,060
Scott: Yeah, that's the plot of cowboy bebop and every other episode has nothing to do with the plot.

505
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:55,520
Rym: It's just character building and character development and emotional attachment and also awesome standalone action.

506
00:38:55,770 --> 00:39:04,552
Rym: Yep but second gig went one step further and they broke it up into like three different kinds of episodes like the Individual the divisual the whatever.

507
00:39:05,035 --> 00:39:13,720
Scott: don't even worry about it Yes, but needless to say like there's one kind of episode in second gig that has nothing to do with the plot But there's very few of those episodes.

508
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:20,880
Scott: Most of the episodes are either individual or divisual or whatever they're called and they relate to the plot in different ways.

509
00:39:21,201 --> 00:39:22,364
Rym: Now here's the part.

510
00:39:22,424 --> 00:39:25,291
Rym: I was getting it in first gig the.

511
00:39:25,512 --> 00:39:28,880
Rym: there's an overarching plot, but the plot is a mystery.

512
00:39:29,182 --> 00:39:36,796
Rym: There's the laughing man, you know, you've seen that Spirally kind of face that has the quote from catcher-in-the-rye on it spinning around.

513
00:39:37,017 --> 00:39:37,920
Rym: It's like the happy face.

514
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:44,759
Rym: Yeah A lot of people cosplay as it at conventions because it's a funny simple clever cosplay to do and you see it around a lot.

515
00:39:45,381 --> 00:39:53,013
Rym: It's from that show and the plot of figuring out what the laughing man is and how all these events related to it all come together.

516
00:39:53,033 --> 00:39:58,340
Rym: and it's kind of this mystery and That's kind of how first gig goes and it's really awesome and really well done.

517
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:07,533
Rym: Second gig goes in a completely different direction and unlike first gig where not only did you not know what was going on But you didn't actually know who was behind it.

518
00:40:07,895 --> 00:40:11,060
Rym: There was no villain There was just events and you were trying to piece it together.

519
00:40:11,361 --> 00:40:18,535
Scott: Yeah, and you knew that certain people are on different sides and fighting for different things but you weren't quite sure because everyone was all secretive.

520
00:40:18,576 --> 00:40:25,334
Scott: you it's like And it is basically difficult situations lots of people on different sides.

521
00:40:25,374 --> 00:40:32,754
Scott: You don't know what anyone's trying to do and Somehow section 9 has to decide if they should do anything at all.

522
00:40:33,276 --> 00:40:35,186
Scott: if they're gonna do something What should they do?

523
00:40:35,649 --> 00:40:36,635
Scott: How should they do it?

524
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:42,020
Scott: And It's kind of a lot like sanctuary in a way and where it's like, oh, we're in a situation.

525
00:40:42,562 --> 00:40:43,224
Scott: What do we do?

526
00:40:43,665 --> 00:40:46,174
Rym: Yeah more more so second gig I think

527
00:40:46,595 --> 00:40:46,816
Scott: yeah,

528
00:40:47,037 --> 00:40:56,197
Rym: but yeah first gig, you know It's this whole mystery and you're trying to piece it together and you can't really figure it out on your own and you kind of Figure it out as the characters do or particularly as togasa does.

529
00:40:56,418 --> 00:41:03,540
Rym: Yeah In second gig they do something really interesting that I didn't expect cuz I wondered how could they have more standalone complex.

530
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,684
Rym: It's just gonna be the same thing.

531
00:41:05,306 --> 00:41:09,020
Rym: They show you a villain right away and there they make no bones about it.

532
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,754
Rym: They're like this guy is the bad guy.

533
00:41:11,774 --> 00:41:12,719
Scott: Well, they don't say it.

534
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,510
Scott: Oh, they said there's some doubt but it's obvious.

535
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:18,120
Scott: cuz they who else no one looks like that.

536
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,187
Scott: Who isn't the bad guy?

537
00:41:19,327 --> 00:41:30,212
Rym: and while there might be some doubt It's the same level of doubt as to whether or not the guy in the red coat was actually Vashta stampede or not exactly, you know, it's the bad guy.

538
00:41:30,493 --> 00:41:33,765
Rym: and you might second-guess yourself and think no They're just setting me up.

539
00:41:33,805 --> 00:41:35,613
Rym: No it they totally.

540
00:41:35,653 --> 00:41:37,120
Rym: there's no way he's not the bad guy.

541
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:42,314
Rym: So the show is still interesting because now it's not what's going on.

542
00:41:42,595 --> 00:41:43,597
Rym: who's behind this?

543
00:41:43,858 --> 00:41:44,580
Rym: What's the plot?

544
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:46,000
Rym: It's all right.

545
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:49,547
Rym: If that's the bad guy What's he trying to do?

546
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:50,793
Rym: and how is he gonna pull it off?

547
00:41:50,833 --> 00:41:52,260
Rym: because they know he's the bad guy.

548
00:41:52,745 --> 00:41:53,839
Rym: I know he's the bad guy.

549
00:41:54,303 --> 00:42:00,211
Rym: everyone knows he's the bad guy and Yet he still pulls things off and you wonder hide it.

550
00:42:00,792 --> 00:42:03,120
Rym: It's this totally different vibe and yet it's equally good.

551
00:42:03,581 --> 00:42:13,620
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty awesome mostly because it while you know who the bad guy is You're not quite sure what he wants or what he's doing or how he's doing things.

552
00:42:14,102 --> 00:42:17,196
Scott: There are other players besides just section 9 and the bad guy.

553
00:42:17,216 --> 00:42:20,688
Scott: it's not a one-on-one It's like a three or four way go around here.

554
00:42:20,708 --> 00:42:20,768
Scott: And

555
00:42:21,551 --> 00:42:32,410
Rym: also another thing that both series do extremely well, is that the pace of the plot and the pace of what's going on kind of Increases episode by episode along with the plot

556
00:42:32,912 --> 00:42:33,513
Scott: and then both

557
00:42:33,554 --> 00:42:46,100
Rym: of them the last several episodes Just kind of rush at this frantic Awesome pace of just it pulls you along with cliffhangers Just keeps going and going and going to go and then everything explodes in a moment of awesome.

558
00:42:46,482 --> 00:42:48,050
Rym: And then it's over and you feel Spence.

559
00:42:48,271 --> 00:42:55,702
Scott: Yeah, it's definitely exponential Which is why I recommend watching the episodes pretty close to each other and not not like, you know One every.

560
00:42:55,762 --> 00:42:58,269
Rym: you know another show that did that really well Gundam seed.

561
00:42:58,791 --> 00:43:02,000
Scott: Yeah, it's like the show starts off introducing things.

562
00:43:02,181 --> 00:43:03,007
Scott: Get the ball roll.

563
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:07,031
Scott: It's a snowball, you know, it starts out small It's big and big and big and big and that's awesome.

564
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:08,800
Scott: And then it hits the wall and the snow everywhere.

565
00:43:09,282 --> 00:43:12,517
Rym: Actually vision of escaflowne is another show that did that really really well.

566
00:43:12,858 --> 00:43:19,400
Rym: granted Escaflowne did it by accident because the show was supposed to be 39 episodes and they had to cut it short.

567
00:43:19,762 --> 00:43:24,282
Rym: So they crammed 26 episodes into the last 13.

568
00:43:24,282 --> 00:43:26,133
Rym: Granted that worked out really well.

569
00:43:26,294 --> 00:43:32,957
Rym: another case for Sometimes things are good because the limitations instead of because you got what you wanted, but I digress.

570
00:43:33,419 --> 00:43:36,000
Rym: Yep Obviously this wasn't a straight-up review.

571
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:40,375
Rym: We just kind of wanted to talk about these shows because they really need to be talked about.

572
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:41,840
Rym: they're fantastic anime.

573
00:43:42,201 --> 00:43:43,345
Rym: They're really accessible.

574
00:43:43,365 --> 00:43:45,291
Rym: I highly recommend you.

575
00:43:45,652 --> 00:43:46,374
Rym: Yes, there is.

576
00:43:46,755 --> 00:43:48,220
Rym: they're beautifully animated.

577
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:51,009
Rym: The music is absolutely amazing.

578
00:43:51,029 --> 00:43:54,380
Scott: right for anyone doesn't realize like if you were in jet in Japan.

579
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:59,380
Scott: Let's say you're a Japanese person living in Japan and you want to watch standalone complex second gig, right?

580
00:43:59,781 --> 00:44:00,679
Scott: You know how you watch it?

581
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,839
Scott: Well first you can buy expensive as DVDs because now the show is finally out out.

582
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,087
Scott: But who can afford those DVDs?

583
00:44:07,127 --> 00:44:07,769
Scott: not many people?

584
00:44:07,809 --> 00:44:10,860
Rym: Yeah DVDs are like $10,000 in Japan and they have one episode.

585
00:44:11,141 --> 00:44:12,367
Scott: But of course you're in Japan.

586
00:44:12,387 --> 00:44:14,275
Scott: So you watched it when it was on TV, right?

587
00:44:14,335 --> 00:44:14,697
Scott: Didn't you?

588
00:44:14,898 --> 00:44:15,239
Scott: didn't you?

589
00:44:16,283 --> 00:44:17,979
Scott: No, because it's pay-per-view.

590
00:44:18,684 --> 00:44:20,013
Scott: It's pay-per-view for this.

591
00:44:20,053 --> 00:44:20,939
Scott: That's how good it is.

592
00:44:21,226 --> 00:44:29,321
Scott: Yeah The fact that you're getting these shows on normal DVDs at normal prices as long as you don't buy the crazy special editions in America.

593
00:44:29,663 --> 00:44:31,349
Scott: you're basically ripping them off.

594
00:44:31,972 --> 00:44:34,020
Scott: Hey, they had to pay-per-view to watch this.

595
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:39,140
Scott: It's that good and you can watch it on a cheap DVD or Netflix it and it's so worth it.

596
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:46,393
Scott: Don't miss the opportunity to basically rip off the production IG and watch their amazing show for all.

597
00:44:46,474 --> 00:44:47,900
Scott: basically what's basically free?

598
00:44:48,422 --> 00:44:51,391
Rym: Yeah, watch these shows and remember I said they're accessible.

599
00:44:51,853 --> 00:44:54,040
Rym: You don't need to know anything about ghost in the shell.

600
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:57,891
Rym: I know a lot of anime fans when they talk about things.

601
00:44:57,932 --> 00:45:05,400
Rym: there was like oh, yeah the major major Kusanagi Yeah, the major Bato the major and they know all about the ghost in the shell universe and all of them.

602
00:45:05,923 --> 00:45:08,700
Rym: You don't need to know anything coming in to ghost.

603
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,997
Scott: You can watch second gig without having seen first gig and you'll be all good.

604
00:45:13,459 --> 00:45:17,222
Rym: Yep and I'm not gonna spoil anything but Another.

605
00:45:17,283 --> 00:45:22,560
Rym: I just want to point out that first gig does something that brought a tear to my eye.

606
00:45:22,821 --> 00:45:32,506
Rym: there is a very touching and extremely emotional and well done scene near the end and Something almost identical Happens in second gig.

607
00:45:32,686 --> 00:45:36,700
Scott: it's like they pulled the same trick twice and I was like you can't do the same thing twice.

608
00:45:36,801 --> 00:45:38,977
Rym: It won't work this and I knew they were doing like crap.

609
00:45:39,219 --> 00:45:41,339
Rym: now They're gonna do the thing and they think I'm gonna cry.

610
00:45:41,581 --> 00:45:44,813
Scott: They just like they did this last season how they gonna do it again this season.

611
00:45:44,933 --> 00:45:46,680
Scott: I do it again and it works again.

612
00:45:47,322 --> 00:45:49,190
Rym: I was thinking I'm not gonna cry.

613
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:50,635
Rym: I saw this already.

614
00:45:50,655 --> 00:45:51,800
Rym: They're doing the exact same thing.

615
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:52,807
Rym: They're not fooling anyone.

616
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:54,560
Rym: and then the exact same thing happened.

617
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:57,539
Rym: But the way they did it a tear came to my eye.

618
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:01,011
Scott: Bastards, how could they pull off the same thing twice?

619
00:46:01,072 --> 00:46:02,960
Scott: Well, we know they can't pull it off a third time.

620
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:03,985
Scott: That's just not gonna happen.

621
00:46:04,427 --> 00:46:05,130
Rym: You know, they will.

622
00:46:05,552 --> 00:46:06,415
Scott: now there's no way.

623
00:46:06,556 --> 00:46:07,420
Scott: well, it's not fast.

624
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:08,485
Rym: I don't think there's gonna be more.

625
00:46:08,545 --> 00:46:11,540
Rym: I don't think there's other unless they do like super super double.

626
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:21,127
Scott: well, the only ghost in the shell that I have not experienced is the solid state society movie and also the Ghost in the shell 1.5.

627
00:46:21,127 --> 00:46:28,838
Scott: Manga because they've read goes in the show one and two manga, but not the 1.5 Manga, but I have pre-ordered the 1.5 manga, so I'm gonna get it and read it.

628
00:46:29,481 --> 00:46:33,660
Rym: So we'll probably do an episode some kind of final thoughts thing or a straight-up review.

629
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,619
Scott: We'll actually talk about what the plots are.

630
00:46:35,951 --> 00:46:49,160
Rym: Yeah Because actually the one thing I like about ghost in the shell the movies the manga the manga Especially when it comes to not just science fiction But real concerns that are actually going to matter probably in our lifetimes.

631
00:46:49,781 --> 00:46:57,564
Rym: Yeah in terms of what consciousness really is especially if you can start mapping out how brains function that It's really like.

632
00:46:57,584 --> 00:47:01,277
Scott: if I made a computer that did everything that a brain did would it be a brain?

633
00:47:01,377 --> 00:47:02,240
Scott: would it be a person?

634
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:03,021
Scott: You know

635
00:47:03,523 --> 00:47:03,663
Rym: all

636
00:47:03,703 --> 00:47:04,646
Scott: those sorts of questions,

637
00:47:04,827 --> 00:47:20,720
Rym: but ghost in the shell and even standalone complex despite its more actiony Accessible roots brings up a lot of interesting issues and While it gets a little bit hard to follow in second gig I actually got lost a couple times had to rewind.

638
00:47:20,941 --> 00:47:26,360
Rym: I was lost a few times as part of it because I had to read subtitles that were and normally subtitles aren't a problem.

639
00:47:26,421 --> 00:47:27,696
Rym: I'm so used to reading subtitles.

640
00:47:27,756 --> 00:47:34,868
Rym: in fact I kind of get startled when even if I'm watching something in English, and there's not subtitles there I'm so used to watching subtitles.

641
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:39,549
Rym: Yeah, but in fact in RIT We always watch your ratio hornblower with the subtitles on.

642
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:43,100
Scott: yeah, well, that's so you could you know yell and scream yep?

643
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:49,360
Scott: Yeah, you could yell and scream and then still beyond know what's going on even though everyone's yelling louder than the characters are talking.

644
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:53,311
Rym: But the political and the social social.

645
00:47:53,893 --> 00:47:57,748
Rym: I think I was gonna gay sociopolitical, but I already said political so I'll just say social issues.

646
00:47:58,271 --> 00:48:02,740
Rym: that second gig raises are Fascinating to say the least yes.

647
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:19,100
Scott: But what ends up happening is the characters when discussing things will say these really long complicated sentences with lots of things about politics economics and society and It's kind of hard to follow in subtitles everything that they're saying and keep it in your brain.

648
00:48:19,661 --> 00:48:21,748
Rym: It's also hard because what like?

649
00:48:22,009 --> 00:48:37,216
Rym: they'll have this huge monologue where the majors explaining some social phenomenon And I started thinking about it because it's really interesting and it's not something I'd considered before and then There's a gunfight, and I totally forget what the major was talking about because now batos shooting some guy

650
00:48:37,296 --> 00:48:51,420
Scott: and then in the next episode it's like I don't really bring over any of the things they talked about in the last episode and It's sort of like I get little pieces as I go along instead of getting the whole picture because I'm reading it doing the subtitles And the dub is an okay dub.

651
00:48:51,560 --> 00:49:01,098
Scott: So I think it might actually even if the dub isn't as good as the Japanese voice acting it might be worth it to watch Just so you can get enough of the show into your brain.

652
00:49:01,159 --> 00:49:05,957
Rym: yes It is definitely one of the far and away superior dubs of modern anime.

653
00:49:06,178 --> 00:49:09,153
Scott: yep All right, I think we're done, and I have to go to bed.

654
00:49:09,193 --> 00:49:09,515
Scott: cuz good.
