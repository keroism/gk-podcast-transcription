1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,317
Rym: Hey, it's Monday, May 4th.

2
00:00:11,558 --> 00:00:11,999
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:15,670
Rym: I'm Scott and this is geek nides tonight's typing.

4
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:26,917
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:31,024 --> 00:00:36,830
Rym: So I realized the other day kind of shockingly that 90s nostalgia is soon going to be the thing.

6
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,560
Rym: and I realized this when I saw Fern Gully.

7
00:00:40,382 --> 00:00:44,628
Rym: Suddenly everyone on the internet was talking about Fern Gully I think because it was on the Netflix on demand.

8
00:00:44,668 --> 00:00:47,159
Rym: all of a sudden and we all remember Fern Gully is 90s.

9
00:00:48,044 --> 00:00:49,879
Rym: I thought I'm pretty sure that was a 90s movie.

10
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:50,883
Rym: Scott I'm just gonna check.

11
00:00:50,983 --> 00:00:55,119
Rym: it had a surfer guy named Zach and it was about the rainforests.

12
00:00:55,841 --> 00:00:56,202
Scott: Uh-huh.

13
00:00:56,604 --> 00:00:58,750
Rym: There is no way that movie wasn't made in the 90s.

14
00:00:58,911 --> 00:00:59,152
Rym: Wow.

15
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:01,038
Scott: I can't find it on IMDb.

16
00:01:01,078 --> 00:01:01,600
Scott: What the fuck?

17
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,785
Rym: There's no way it's not an IMDb.

18
00:01:04,307 --> 00:01:05,731
Rym: Not that it was a good movie.

19
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:06,855
Scott: Oh, there it is.

20
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:08,460
Scott: It's always was one word.

21
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:09,567
Scott: That's why I couldn't get it.

22
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:17,759
Scott: Okay, Fern Gully 1 92 Gully 2 The magical rescue.

23
00:01:20,521 --> 00:01:22,251
Scott: Wow, oh there's a trailer.

24
00:01:22,573 --> 00:01:23,780
Rym: we don't need to watch the trailer.

25
00:01:24,483 --> 00:01:26,471
Rym: I mean, I saw the land before time seven.

26
00:01:26,512 --> 00:01:28,440
Scott: I don't you saw the land before time seven.

27
00:01:29,561 --> 00:01:31,550
Scott: I'm gonna find out how many land before times there are here.

28
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,425
Rym: I go to Wikipedia, but it just I Wasn't that long ago.

29
00:01:35,505 --> 00:01:38,700
Rym: someone was someone in the crew brought up something about the nostalgia culture.

30
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:44,240
Rym: How come how come it was all 80s nostalgia or is the next generation not gonna be full of nostalgia?

31
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:48,160
Rym: And then we all kind of pointed out that we're right about that time.

32
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:58,639
Rym: We're just gonna turn into 90s nostalgia because our generation, you know The late 80s early 90s are getting to the age where the 80s nostalgia came out when those people hit our age.

33
00:01:59,442 --> 00:02:09,596
Scott: Okay, according to Wikipedia on the land before time series page because if you just go to land before time It talks about the first movie, but there's a land before time series page on Wikipedia.

34
00:02:09,656 --> 00:02:10,580
Rym: What's it say about Petrie?

35
00:02:10,982 --> 00:02:11,565
Rym: Here's the man.

36
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:12,348
Scott: it doesn't say anything.

37
00:02:12,388 --> 00:02:18,252
Scott: it says says it says that there were ahem done done done done.

38
00:02:18,453 --> 00:02:24,538
Scott: in current existence There are 13 lands before time Jesus and next year.

39
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,711
Scott: Well in 2009 land before time 14 will exist.

40
00:02:29,972 --> 00:02:32,297
Rym: It's not like they could avert the apocalypse.

41
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:42,000
Scott: I Think it might be something that's like someone is paying to keep going in order to like, you know Train animators or something like, you know, I just I don't know.

42
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,426
Scott: I mean, it's like you can break.

43
00:02:43,486 --> 00:02:46,760
Scott: I think that's my guess is you can break into the animation industry.

44
00:02:47,121 --> 00:02:50,938
Scott: It's like you get on the land before time and then you can work on something else.

45
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:59,326
Rym: as you know Maybe the land before time is like hentai in Japan because half the great voice actors We know started out in hentai.

46
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,333
Scott: Oh, it could be something in.

47
00:03:01,573 --> 00:03:05,103
Rym: ever since I found out who the rape man really was I've just been disillusioned Mm-hmm.

48
00:03:07,101 --> 00:03:09,448
Scott: Anyway, so I started a new work today.

49
00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:11,756
Rym: Yeah, Scott's gainfully employed.

50
00:03:11,877 --> 00:03:14,447
Scott: It's a I was Just a month ago.

51
00:03:14,487 --> 00:03:17,680
Scott: This isn't in fact, it's more rare for me to not be gainfully.

52
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:19,840
Rym: Yes, but you it has been a change of state.

53
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:24,719
Rym: I mean, it's kind of like Manchester differential where we only update when there is a change.

54
00:03:26,062 --> 00:03:30,506
Scott: You mean like it anyway, it only writes down the changes It doesn't make copies of the whole.

55
00:03:30,526 --> 00:03:33,800
Rym: well actually Manchester differential also has an automatic mid-bit transition.

56
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:38,358
Rym: Technically you have a fake update every second, but then right anyway.

57
00:03:40,381 --> 00:03:45,074
Scott: So, you know, there are things to say about the new work, but you know pertaining to the work itself.

58
00:03:45,135 --> 00:03:46,579
Scott: I can't really say anything.

59
00:03:47,980 --> 00:04:08,600
Scott: But pertaining to the meta of the work You know, they didn't give me too much choice in Machinery, so my choices are pretty much Desktop Dell which was you know, which I would have gone with because I had an Optiplex in my last job and it was fantastic Except for the fact that there might be some working from home action going on.

60
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:20,000
Scott: So it has to be some sort of laptop action right with some sort of docking situation like there was at my two jobs ago You know, so I wanted a Lenovo x300 but that probably wasn't gonna happen.

61
00:04:20,401 --> 00:04:24,513
Scott: So my choices are pretty much like Dell laptop or MacBook, right?

62
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:27,965
Scott: So I'm like, well, you know, whatever It's for work only.

63
00:04:28,025 --> 00:04:29,431
Scott: I'm not using it for my shit.

64
00:04:29,571 --> 00:04:33,238
Scott: So as long as it, you know is good for the work It doesn't bother me, you know.

65
00:04:33,922 --> 00:04:40,464
Scott: So the other guy was using the MacBook and apparently the MacBook Pro doesn't come in 13-inch It only comes in 15 or 17.

66
00:04:40,464 --> 00:04:43,596
Scott: Yeah, so I was like well fuck that.

67
00:04:43,757 --> 00:04:47,959
Scott: so I got the 13 You know and I could probably do a whole show.

68
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:54,440
Scott: I just talking about it cuz I've never really used a ma an OS X as a desktop for an extended usage.

69
00:04:54,621 --> 00:05:03,700
Rym: I mean I can say way way back, you know in the kind of early days of GeekNights Remember when I still work to that hospital and I bought that Mac mini and I was like, yeah fuck Linux fuck windows.

70
00:05:03,821 --> 00:05:09,120
Rym: I'm going Mac and Wallet could not podcast and it could not play games.

71
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:12,810
Rym: It was really pretty and slick for everything else.

72
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:16,120
Scott: I was yeah, I mean it seems like you know for everything that there is.

73
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,026
Scott: That's bad about it.

74
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,119
Scott: There's something else good like for example, right?

75
00:05:19,761 --> 00:05:21,006
Scott: They have done the new ones.

76
00:05:21,046 --> 00:05:22,673
Scott: They got this giant touchpad.

77
00:05:22,734 --> 00:05:24,220
Scott: That is a button, right?

78
00:05:24,885 --> 00:05:26,760
Scott: And there are some things I don't like about it.

79
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:39,985
Scott: Like pushing it in is a little harder than pushing in like a separate button, you know, like on my other my laptop You know, so that's annoying and it doesn't have two buttons, but it does have ways that you can you know Like I set it up.

80
00:05:40,025 --> 00:05:43,280
Scott: So if you push the bottom right corner of it, it is a right button.

81
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:47,842
Scott: Click you see stuff like that, but for every bad thing like that There's a good thing.

82
00:05:47,902 --> 00:05:53,760
Scott: for example, if you put two fingers on it and slide around you can scroll up and down.

83
00:05:54,802 --> 00:06:00,205
Scott: And if you put four fingers on it, you can do the expose by going up or down, you know I'm gonna follow Luke here.

84
00:06:00,668 --> 00:06:02,840
Rym: There is a sexual joke that could be made.

85
00:06:03,021 --> 00:06:03,927
Rym: Yeah, I'm not going to make.

86
00:06:04,008 --> 00:06:05,860
Scott: there is a lot this you know, so that's pretty cool.

87
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,099
Rym: Yeah, what happens if you do the shocker to it?

88
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:08,971
Rym: I don't know.

89
00:06:09,461 --> 00:06:15,900
Scott: But there are actually little videos in the preferences in the control panel showing you like the control panel for configuring.

90
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,257
Scott: It has video showing you how to use it.

91
00:06:18,861 --> 00:06:27,906
Scott: Anyway, the one there is one the one annoyance that is like the annoyance I cannot beat and it is like this incredible Constant annoyance and I want to.

92
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:33,905
Scott: I want to call out and see if anyone can help me with this because it's not the kind Of thing that's easy to search for.

93
00:06:33,986 --> 00:06:36,454
Rym: I swear to God if you say it's a Mac.

94
00:06:36,675 --> 00:06:37,478
Rym: How do I change that?

95
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:39,342
Scott: No Okay.

96
00:06:39,362 --> 00:06:40,525
Scott: So here's the problem, right?

97
00:06:40,546 --> 00:06:40,826
Scott: All right.

98
00:06:41,027 --> 00:06:42,852
Scott: Okay caps lock key is useless.

99
00:06:42,912 --> 00:06:44,477
Scott: Everyone knows this right.

100
00:06:44,597 --> 00:06:49,608
Scott: if you use caps lock key You're stupid Except for very very rare circumstances.

101
00:06:49,748 --> 00:06:51,374
Rym: simple data entry, right?

102
00:06:51,675 --> 00:07:02,820
Scott: So because it's you know Even though you should you know, you might have an occasional legitimate use for it There's no reason for it to be right there in an incredibly easy to hit position.

103
00:07:03,362 --> 00:07:14,160
Scott: You want the keys you use the most often to be in the incredibly easy to hit positions, you know Right next to your home row, you know, you want the rarely placed keys to be far away.

104
00:07:14,842 --> 00:07:19,920
Scott: So I always and you should do convert caps lock into control.

105
00:07:20,101 --> 00:07:22,411
Rym: I found four programs you can pay for to do that.

106
00:07:22,652 --> 00:07:24,520
Scott: No, no, no, no, no what that's just.

107
00:07:25,461 --> 00:07:26,203
Rym: I'm just.

108
00:07:26,303 --> 00:07:26,744
Rym: I just did.

109
00:07:26,945 --> 00:07:34,108
Scott: Uh, anyway, you can turn caps lock into control in the Mac OS X control panel, there's an option.

110
00:07:34,168 --> 00:07:34,489
Scott: I did it.

111
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:35,171
Scott: Okay.

112
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,077
Rym: All right, obviously, there's something wrong.

113
00:07:37,238 --> 00:07:37,619
Scott: Obviously.

114
00:07:37,679 --> 00:07:39,671
Scott: Yes I'm just explaining the situation.

115
00:07:39,691 --> 00:07:40,435
Scott: is it sticky?

116
00:07:40,455 --> 00:07:44,530
Scott: No Get me it's a complicated situation.

117
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:45,674
Scott: It's not something stupid.

118
00:07:45,734 --> 00:07:46,096
Scott: All right.

119
00:07:46,136 --> 00:07:46,397
Scott: Okay.

120
00:07:46,617 --> 00:08:00,100
Scott: Okay, so In Firefox right on Windows and Linux all the keyboard Shortcuts are like ctrl T for a new tab or ctrl N for a new window or ctrl tab to change tabs, right?

121
00:08:00,765 --> 00:08:01,411
Scott: That's awesome.

122
00:08:01,734 --> 00:08:10,682
Scott: Right in Mac all the keyboard shortcuts in Firefox are command T command tab command N Right.

123
00:08:10,742 --> 00:08:13,313
Scott: replace control with the command key, right?

124
00:08:14,016 --> 00:08:14,760
Scott: Not a big deal.

125
00:08:15,081 --> 00:08:21,017
Scott: So I changed the caps the can caps lock into command instead of changing it into control, right?

126
00:08:21,619 --> 00:08:22,080
Scott: That's cool.

127
00:08:23,023 --> 00:08:30,329
Scott: the problem is on the Mac and say the terminal application or Vim or just about anywhere else.

128
00:08:30,871 --> 00:08:32,155
Scott: It's still control.

129
00:08:32,256 --> 00:08:33,179
Scott: It's not command.

130
00:08:33,741 --> 00:08:37,880
Scott: So I have to constantly freaking go into the menu like for Firefox.

131
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:46,165
Scott: I need it to the caps lock key to be command but everywhere else I need the caps lock key to be control and There's no way to do that.

132
00:08:46,265 --> 00:08:49,640
Scott: So either I have to use like this command key.

133
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:55,800
Scott: That's in a weird position for all the Firefox shortcuts or I have to use like the control key.

134
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,520
Scott: That's in a weird position from the everything else shortcut.

135
00:08:58,661 --> 00:09:03,440
Rym: Okay, so I found this farm post or someone has the same quick problem.

136
00:09:04,382 --> 00:09:06,989
Rym: They ask it in a very different way, uh-huh.

137
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:11,621
Rym: I installed Firefox on my Mac my new Mac, by the way It's awesome.

138
00:09:11,721 --> 00:09:12,403
Rym: I really like it.

139
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:17,702
Rym: But for some reason all the control shortcuts don't work Hmm.

140
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,006
Rym: Why can't I hit?

141
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:21,032
Rym: why don't my control something shortcuts work?

142
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:21,875
Scott: Uh-huh.

143
00:09:22,417 --> 00:09:24,464
Rym: I don't think he realizes Right.

144
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,868
Scott: I knew that they were command.

145
00:09:25,888 --> 00:09:28,516
Rym: I don't think he realizes the first response works.

146
00:09:28,557 --> 00:09:29,219
Rym: fine for me.

147
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:31,391
Rym: Yes Reply, what are you using?

148
00:09:31,773 --> 00:09:32,820
Rym: reply windows?

149
00:09:34,598 --> 00:09:35,763
Rym: I Don't know.

150
00:09:36,064 --> 00:09:42,709
Scott: did see this wasn't a problem in the living room where we have a Mac already because I only ever used Firefox in the living room.

151
00:09:42,729 --> 00:09:44,240
Scott: I don't use anything else down there.

152
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:49,840
Scott: So turning the caps lock in living room into the command key is great because I never need the control key.

153
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,253
Scott: I don't use anything but Firefox in the living room.

154
00:09:52,515 --> 00:09:59,179
Scott: I don't use the terminal I don't and the worst right is that I've got parallels with Ubuntu and Windows running in it.

155
00:10:00,302 --> 00:10:02,889
Scott: Right, so what I'm what I'm focused on?

156
00:10:02,929 --> 00:10:13,380
Scott: like this virtual machine running Ubuntu and I've got a terminal and I want to push ctrl L to clear the terminal right or ctrl T to open a tab in the Firefox in the virtual machine.

157
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:15,519
Scott: I got this command key there.

158
00:10:16,342 --> 00:10:25,040
Scott: So I think the optimal solution would be to set the key to be control because in everything but Firefox I want it to be control, right?

159
00:10:25,361 --> 00:10:35,700
Scott: So then wouldn't just I need to find I need to find some way to Screw with a Mac Firefox so that control works instead of command for all the shortcuts.

160
00:10:36,162 --> 00:10:42,006
Scott: So if anyone knows how to do that, or if anyone knows of any other solution to this problem I need this.

161
00:10:42,067 --> 00:10:44,319
Scott: this is like a serious problem here.

162
00:10:45,843 --> 00:10:46,346
Rym: Yeah, you're right.

163
00:10:46,366 --> 00:10:47,876
Rym: That's kind of hard to Google for.

164
00:10:48,138 --> 00:10:49,024
Scott: yeah How do I change?

165
00:10:51,624 --> 00:10:52,159
Rym: Control?

166
00:10:53,241 --> 00:10:58,820
Scott: Yeah, how to modify Mac Firefox keyboard shortcuts from command to control?

167
00:10:58,921 --> 00:11:01,580
Scott: I don't think that's gonna come up with the right answer.

168
00:11:02,122 --> 00:11:05,775
Rym: I'm kind of curious too because that would I would run into this problem if I tried.

169
00:11:05,835 --> 00:11:09,487
Scott: it's it's incredibly frustrating You know, especially since right?

170
00:11:09,868 --> 00:11:18,420
Scott: I mean while this is gonna be my work computer and Hours wise I will spend more time using it than other computers.

171
00:11:19,143 --> 00:11:23,300
Scott: I still use Windows and Linux just about everywhere and I've got this virtual machine and you know.

172
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:33,215
Scott: So I'm not really, you know while I'm using a Mac hardware machine like, you know, eight hours a day at least probably You know for the you know foreseeable future.

173
00:11:33,235 --> 00:12:00,360
Scott: I You know, I'm not really using Mac OS, you know that many hours and So I getting used to like using the command key instead of the control key is probably just gonna be incredibly frustrating Because I'd have to keep switching back and forth, you know I've sort of unified the keyboard shortcuts across everything because I'm using you know Vim and the terminal and Firefox everywhere and they're all the same shortcuts except on the stupid Mac where it's a different shortcut.

174
00:12:00,462 --> 00:12:00,935
Scott: It's like die.

175
00:12:02,442 --> 00:12:03,548
Scott: So that's help me out.

176
00:12:04,192 --> 00:12:05,720
Scott: Yeah, so my pinky doesn't break off.

177
00:12:07,162 --> 00:12:11,318
Rym: We won't give you anything other than fame and Internet glory, but that's it.

178
00:12:11,941 --> 00:12:13,149
Rym: So you got any I don't know.

179
00:12:13,209 --> 00:12:17,851
Rym: tech news a tech news Well speaking of I got a bunch of little stuff.

180
00:12:18,273 --> 00:12:20,140
Scott: well speaking of the the apples, right?

181
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:29,715
Scott: There are some stories going around relatively recently less than a week ago that Well, actually it's sort of like there were murmurs way back like months ago.

182
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:31,320
Scott: And now there's more murmurs, right?

183
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:43,460
Scott: The murmur way back was that Apple bought like these chip making chip designing companies like companies that design microchips Right and more recently they've started to hire, you know microchip designer people.

184
00:12:44,103 --> 00:12:46,859
Scott: So everyone's like Apple's gonna make their own chips, you know.

185
00:12:47,782 --> 00:12:50,912
Scott: And the murmurs that are going around are ludicrous.

186
00:12:51,212 --> 00:13:06,780
Scott: I say cuz what people are saying is like Apple's gonna make you know their own CPUs instead of using Intel that way, you know You can't install OS X on fucking anything But Apple hardware because Apple hard will be the only way to get Apple chips and that's gonna be it.

187
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,726
Rym: No, they don't even need that.

188
00:13:09,167 --> 00:13:25,220
Scott: while Apple would probably like the DRM aspect of that There is no way that any chip Apple can design is ever ever ever going to Match with Intel or Nvidia in the performance power usage efficiency departments.

189
00:13:25,783 --> 00:13:29,640
Scott: It would cost so much money and require so much talent.

190
00:13:30,022 --> 00:13:33,400
Scott: There is absolutely no way they can ever catch up to that right, you know, it's kind of sad.

191
00:13:33,501 --> 00:13:37,323
Rym: I used to work in a place where I could find out more about this But yeah, I don't.

192
00:13:37,363 --> 00:13:49,620
Scott: but what Apple is doing I can almost guarantee is they're looking for ways To develop more specialized chips for the smaller devices, you know, that's actually what I was just about to suggest.

193
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,339
Rym: It's also a way to really really reduce the cost of production for things like iPod.

194
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,791
Scott: Yeah, I mean it's not necessarily the CPUs either right?

195
00:13:57,871 --> 00:13:59,276
Scott: I mean look at an iPod.

196
00:13:59,337 --> 00:14:02,730
Scott: right in an iPod You have all different functionality, right?

197
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:13,633
Scott: You need a display chip for the screen You need audio processing for the output, you know hole to your headphones You need input processing because they all iPods all have.

198
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:14,576
Scott: you know audio input.

199
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:22,899
Scott: you need, you know I guess some sort of I/O chip for you know, the buttons I guess and stuff like that, right and you know You only need certain functions, right?

200
00:14:23,681 --> 00:14:27,236
Scott: So you can you know put a CPU in the iPod, right.

201
00:14:27,417 --> 00:14:30,659
Scott: and then you know Put some software and some firmware on there and you're good to go.

202
00:14:31,243 --> 00:14:44,797
Scott: But if you can somehow manage to make a chip You know that in hardware does the things the iPod does and doesn't do anything else and is incredibly Specialized to those functions, you know mp3 decoding video decoding, etc.

203
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:44,998
Scott: Etc.

204
00:14:45,038 --> 00:14:45,138
Scott: Etc.

205
00:14:46,683 --> 00:14:49,460
Scott: You can make the iPod a fuck lot smaller.

206
00:14:50,761 --> 00:14:56,619
Rym: I don't think miniaturization itself is gonna be the concern because if you I mean if you actually touched the newest shuffle.

207
00:14:57,545 --> 00:15:06,040
Scott: Well, they're not snow not just smaller But also more efficient in the electricity and battery life and I think we're pretty much every department.

208
00:15:06,201 --> 00:15:08,740
Rym: I think we're gonna see a lot more battery life if they make their own gym.

209
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:13,870
Rym: Yes, the iPhone battery life, you know, it's the other thing, you know I did see a lot of rumors about.

210
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,920
Rym: you know, where is Apple gonna build their fab?

211
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:24,000
Rym: They're very clearly going to whatever and I don't know what company they'll go with but they might design a chip But then they'll send it to someone like Charlie.

212
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,029
Scott: Yeah, almost nobody owns fabs.

213
00:15:28,491 --> 00:15:34,694
Scott: almost everyone who designs chips sends them to a fab Puts an order in and gets the chips back in the mail.

214
00:15:34,774 --> 00:15:35,980
Scott: That's that's how it works.

215
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:41,380
Scott: I mean, I mean all the iPods are what they're built by like Foxconn or some, you know, Chinese place, right?

216
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:46,380
Scott: But if you buy an Apple product, it says designed by Apple in California made in China.

217
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:50,280
Rym: Well, like as I recall remember the the cell processor the ps3 the IBM baby.

218
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:54,260
Rym: Yeah, that was made by IBM, but it was also made by chartered and all these other people.

219
00:15:54,542 --> 00:15:59,451
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know this fabs all over Taiwan Southeast Asia in the u.s.

220
00:15:59,471 --> 00:16:09,940
Scott: This fab some of them not that The biggest fabs in the country is right down the road from us used to work at it But there's you know, there's lots of fabs around and very few company.

221
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:13,699
Scott: There's a lot more companies designing chips than you know, actually making them.

222
00:16:14,163 --> 00:16:16,340
Scott: I mean, it's the same thing with electronics in general, right?

223
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:22,300
Scott: I mean a lot of people design gadgets, but they don't own a gadget factory, right?

224
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:28,520
Scott: I mean just because you design gadgets and sell gadgets with your brand name on them doesn't mean you own a gadget factory.

225
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:32,423
Scott: You probably just pay someone else to use their gadget factory Usually China.

226
00:16:32,764 --> 00:16:43,640
Rym: more to the point if they actually are going to be designing chips and you know those these rumors are going around We're not going to see any products using these chips for years at least because the does the process of making a chip.

227
00:16:43,801 --> 00:16:44,243
Scott: Well, they did.

228
00:16:44,263 --> 00:16:47,600
Scott: they bought a company that already had a bunch of work done and now they hired people.

229
00:16:47,982 --> 00:16:49,251
Scott: So they're probably well on their way.

230
00:16:49,272 --> 00:16:51,584
Scott: I think within a year or two You'll see the problem.

231
00:16:51,785 --> 00:16:56,180
Rym: maybe because the once the chip is designed like you've got a solid design down.

232
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:00,719
Rym: That's when all the problems actually begin because that's when you do like the test runs you have.

233
00:17:00,739 --> 00:17:03,636
Rym: you know The really poor yields you have to go through this specialized kind of.

234
00:17:04,098 --> 00:17:04,962
Scott: yeah But they're not doing.

235
00:17:05,022 --> 00:17:07,771
Scott: yeah, but the chips that they're probably making right are.

236
00:17:07,811 --> 00:17:10,079
Scott: they're not making like these high-performance CPUs.

237
00:17:10,201 --> 00:17:13,040
Scott: They're making like, you know chips that are much simpler.

238
00:17:13,354 --> 00:17:20,940
Rym: No But if they're making simpler chips or they're using commodity Manufacturing methods then they're not gonna get that much benefit because they probably can't get much more.

239
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,119
Scott: I mean, they're gonna use modern manufacturing methods, but they're gonna make like, you know an mp3 decoder chip.

240
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,910
Scott: You know that has some other stuff on it.

241
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,720
Scott: It's not, you know, too complicated.

242
00:17:29,901 --> 00:17:37,404
Scott: So it's you know, it's it's gonna be a lot less difficult than if you were gonna make, you know From actual manufacturing.

243
00:17:37,484 --> 00:17:47,280
Rym: it's an incredibly complicated process and the real issue is that if you make anything new it Takes ages to figure out how to make it efficiently enough for it not to just lose money.

244
00:17:48,181 --> 00:17:50,428
Scott: Yeah, but you're not making it, you know, calm.

245
00:17:50,488 --> 00:17:52,795
Scott: It's not like, you know a core to do.

246
00:17:52,876 --> 00:17:55,219
Scott: All right, it's it's you know It's an iPod chip.

247
00:17:57,563 --> 00:18:04,110
Rym: What I'm saying is that if they use kind of the tried-and-true Manufacturing methods such that they could start rolling this out more quickly.

248
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:04,973
Rym: Then there are.

249
00:18:05,013 --> 00:18:11,413
Rym: they very likely can't do anything Particularly advanced and as in I don't see them doing anything.

250
00:18:11,433 --> 00:18:13,160
Rym: That would be a noticeable improvement.

251
00:18:13,381 --> 00:18:20,120
Scott: Well, it's a noticeable improvement because what they'll be doing is what Apple has always done right ever since the Apple - which was come.

252
00:18:20,241 --> 00:18:22,959
Scott: Right now, you know, the iPod will have three chips in it.

253
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:30,413
Scott: In the next iPod will have one that does the work of all those three, you know That's that's really all Steve Wozniak did on the original Apple was.

254
00:18:30,433 --> 00:18:37,440
Scott: he just looked at existing computers And he said and there are all these new chips coming out all the time that you can get in Radio Shack or wherever.

255
00:18:37,922 --> 00:18:41,700
Scott: And he's like, hey this new chip that just came out does the work of those three chips.

256
00:18:42,001 --> 00:18:46,500
Scott: And he just kept doing that over and over again and the result was the first Apple computer.

257
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,215
Scott: So I think that you know, there aren't these new chips coming out.

258
00:18:50,255 --> 00:19:00,751
Scott: that does the work of you know The three anymore at least not as rapidly because people have sort of settled into just getting a CPU and doing everything in software With very few specialized hardware chips.

259
00:19:01,393 --> 00:19:10,060
Scott: So what they're gonna do is they're gonna do it Steve Wozniak did way back in the early 80s is You know make a chip that does the work of three or four chips that are already in the iPod.

260
00:19:10,241 --> 00:19:16,860
Rym: I guess if they're gonna if they do something like that I don't think we're actually gonna see any major improvements in their technology.

261
00:19:16,981 --> 00:19:22,092
Rym: All we're gonna see is they charge the same amount of money for the iPod But it cost them a lot less to make it.

262
00:19:22,253 --> 00:19:23,159
Scott: they could be that too.

263
00:19:23,582 --> 00:19:29,730
Scott: I'm pretty sure that they're pretty much by making their own chips They're pretty much getting all of the benefits that we have described.

264
00:19:29,971 --> 00:19:33,040
Scott: at the only cost to them is the cost of designing the chips.

265
00:19:33,321 --> 00:19:41,198
Rym: Well, you know, this is kind of the common thing for any time the economy is slow Especially now where Apple, you know their sales in a recession and this sort of thing people won't buy.

266
00:19:41,218 --> 00:19:44,570
Scott: the $400 I think is Apple's doing better than they are.

267
00:19:44,691 --> 00:19:49,754
Rym: but but now is the time to invest in R&D Especially when it's cheaper to get our and absolutely is.

268
00:19:49,774 --> 00:19:50,900
Scott: this is the R&D time.

269
00:19:51,061 --> 00:19:51,342
Scott: Yes,

270
00:19:51,643 --> 00:20:07,395
Rym: so Apple's looking forward and I'll bet they're just trying to lower their costs and I don't think Anything of note is going to come of this Except for the fact that Apple profits will increase in the long run at least for two years and maybe after that time They might have some sort of advanced chip that does something cool.

271
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:09,644
Scott: Hmm Plus, you know any?

272
00:20:10,286 --> 00:20:14,579
Scott: you know when they do make the like these chips, you know, they don't really advertise like.

273
00:20:14,619 --> 00:20:16,800
Scott: hey This is what chips are in the iPod, right?

274
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:24,596
Scott: You're only gonna find out like if they've done something like after in gadget busts an iPod open and says hey There's only like one chip in this thing.

275
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:25,080
Scott: What the fuck?

276
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,367
Rym: Well, see that's the initial stage.

277
00:20:26,428 --> 00:20:33,380
Rym: my bet stage one is just you know Have a cheaper manufacturing process sell the $400 iPods, but make a lot more money off of them.

278
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,463
Scott: Which is that'd be funny.

279
00:20:34,563 --> 00:20:42,175
Scott: open up an iPod and it's literally a headphone jack a screen a chip a battery and a flash Thing and that's it.

280
00:20:43,102 --> 00:20:53,613
Rym: But then maybe if I were Apple my long-term strategy would be that two three years from now I Suddenly have you know, the Intel brand a little logo the AMD little logo.

281
00:20:53,633 --> 00:20:55,520
Rym: I would have the Apple chip logo.

282
00:20:55,622 --> 00:20:56,639
Rym: I'd call it something cool.

283
00:20:57,062 --> 00:21:01,299
Rym: I would put that sticker on all the stuff that used it and just charge twice as much for those things.

284
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:04,690
Rym: Not bad regardless of whether or not the chip was actually different.

285
00:21:05,292 --> 00:21:05,693
Scott: Mmm.

286
00:21:06,536 --> 00:21:07,860
Rym: I can't rely on Apple too much though.

287
00:21:08,861 --> 00:21:11,030
Scott: Someone else also said that you know make is like.

288
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:16,069
Scott: right now a lot of the chips in the Apple Products are made by you know competitors.

289
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:20,185
Scott: Like I think like Samsung makes them like flash that they use It's like.

290
00:21:20,306 --> 00:21:22,380
Scott: but Samsung also makes mp3 players.

291
00:21:22,921 --> 00:21:30,240
Scott: So by making their own chips, maybe even making their own flash and you know and such they can avoid some of that.

292
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:42,779
Scott: you know conflict of interest in that department and also, you know, sometimes Apple like wants to order stuff and You know, they're sort of held back and their supplies are limited or whatever because you know, people can't keep up.

293
00:21:43,181 --> 00:21:45,429
Rym: Well, it's not just maybe but it did the.

294
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:53,984
Rym: there are two basic paradigms of manufacturing for chips And this applies generally to industrial stuff not just chips thing, you know flash and other parts Like I just said.

295
00:21:54,004 --> 00:21:57,340
Rym: this also applies broadly to general industrial manufacturing.

296
00:21:58,105 --> 00:22:17,817
Rym: but there's either the kind of Commodity you create a whole bunch stored in warehouses and ship it out or the so-called Just-in-time manufacturing where you are manufacturing things to be shipped directly to the people who use them and you never carry an inventory which of Course is much higher risk for the people downstream much lower risk for the people upstream.

297
00:22:18,258 --> 00:22:24,000
Scott: Mm-hmm Yeah, I think you know Apple might be doing something there to you know help its flow.

298
00:22:24,361 --> 00:22:36,760
Rym: but speaking of a conflict of interest remember way back we I forget what show it was but we talked a lot about how Cabled providers are in this conundrum where on one hand they provide TV and on the other hand they provide internet.

299
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:43,920
Rym: So they have this automatic conflict of interest between two competing media that they have an interest in both of them.

300
00:22:44,261 --> 00:22:44,964
Rym: You know, what do they do?

301
00:22:44,984 --> 00:22:49,400
Rym: They're kind of screwing water screwing the other and they're working to the contrary aims of all the consumers.

302
00:22:49,521 --> 00:22:56,980
Scott: Yeah, it's like if you were simultaneously I don't know an ISP and a newspaper at the same time.

303
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:04,860
Scott: It's like, you know, how well by letting people go to news.google.com We're also making our newspaper business go down.

304
00:23:05,121 --> 00:23:10,460
Rym: Well, there's an article on slash shot talking about just that before so we broke the news first.

305
00:23:11,243 --> 00:23:12,869
Rym: I think everyone smart already realized that.

306
00:23:12,909 --> 00:23:15,378
Rym: but it is an interesting article because they the.

307
00:23:16,121 --> 00:23:34,140
Rym: The supposition here is that cable networks that are also is PS most of their infrastructure costs and most of the money and Expenses that are that are happening now that are causing them to say oh we need to raise prices are from HD TV Content and have nothing to do with their ISP internet side.

308
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,995
Scott: Well, but I thought that you know TV like cable TV, you know doesn't use the same.

309
00:23:39,035 --> 00:23:40,118
Scott: I mean it uses bandwidth.

310
00:23:40,239 --> 00:23:44,773
Scott: obviously That's you know technological reality, but it's not IP bandwidth.

311
00:23:44,853 --> 00:23:46,257
Scott: It's you know broadcast it out.

312
00:23:46,337 --> 00:23:47,902
Scott: It's not packet So it's got.

313
00:23:47,922 --> 00:24:04,399
Rym: but so I said infrastructures the infrastructure and cost on the back end of distributing this high-definition signal all this Data everywhere storing it relaying it Uh-huh, keeping up with it Don't forget all the licensing fees and the the complicated relationship of how our cable network gets television and then gives it to you

314
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:04,922
Scott: Yep.

315
00:24:04,962 --> 00:24:05,203
Scott: Yep.

316
00:24:05,223 --> 00:24:05,424
Scott: Yep.

317
00:24:06,026 --> 00:24:09,240
Scott: Well, then again, not all is PS are also cable companies.

318
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:19,740
Scott: You know, some of the ones are you know that are you know, sort of hurting net neutrality are not all you know cable They're you know, giving you, you know t1s and DSLs and phone companies and shit like that.

319
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,225
Rym: Well, they're talking just about cable.

320
00:24:21,486 --> 00:24:21,727
Scott: Uh-huh.

321
00:24:21,928 --> 00:24:22,229
Scott: All right.

322
00:24:23,032 --> 00:24:23,915
Rym: It's an interesting article.

323
00:24:23,955 --> 00:24:24,919
Rym: I recommend everyone read it.

324
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,283
Scott: Yeah, I mean it is.

325
00:24:26,303 --> 00:24:40,900
Scott: it is sort of true that you know you look and you know cable channels do use bandwidth And if they remove say a cable channel, they could fill that space Theoretically, you know with packets instead, you know, they could do that.

326
00:24:41,101 --> 00:24:45,478
Rym: Well, I think it's more that there's gonna be a lot of pressure and a lot of people are supposing this.

327
00:24:45,518 --> 00:24:53,525
Rym: at least You don't remember the whole a la carte cable pricing thing the thing that the that FCC supposedly demanded but never happened.

328
00:24:54,287 --> 00:24:57,696
Rym: if that actually happens that might just be the absolute end of TV.

329
00:24:57,836 --> 00:25:08,080
Rym: because think about this that Like the domino effect would be massive because you've got a lot of TV channels like sippy That no one would actually pay for in enough quantity.

330
00:25:08,123 --> 00:25:20,409
Scott: Yeah if you get if I gave you a list of every cable channel there that exists in the entire world and You would circle the ones you're willing to pay for and the more you circle the more you pay How many are you gonna circle?

331
00:25:20,549 --> 00:25:21,252
Scott: I would circle.

332
00:25:21,292 --> 00:25:24,477
Rym: imagine cable TV would become ESPN TV.

333
00:25:25,121 --> 00:25:31,580
Scott: Yeah, I would circle pretty much any live sports network that carries a New York team that I care about right?

334
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,852
Scott: I would circle one of the mate one of each of the major networks just because You know Cartoon Network ain't what it used to be.

335
00:25:37,892 --> 00:25:39,380
Scott: So fuck them, right?

336
00:25:40,945 --> 00:25:41,369
Scott: I don't know what.

337
00:25:41,389 --> 00:25:42,299
Scott: I circle anything else.

338
00:25:43,285 --> 00:25:43,989
Rym: What about sippy?

339
00:25:44,653 --> 00:25:45,176
Scott: No, no, no.

340
00:25:47,582 --> 00:25:49,308
Rym: What about the anime network?

341
00:25:49,328 --> 00:25:49,930
Rym: does that even still?

342
00:25:49,971 --> 00:25:51,777
Scott: that's an on-demand thing and it sucks.

343
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:53,786
Rym: Yeah, it does suck I just point out.

344
00:25:54,047 --> 00:25:54,369
Scott: I don't know.

345
00:25:54,389 --> 00:25:55,394
Scott: What else would I circle?

346
00:25:55,414 --> 00:25:57,202
Scott: I Don't know.

347
00:25:57,222 --> 00:26:02,380
Rym: What would you circle thing is if if the internet provided live sports for free?

348
00:26:02,741 --> 00:26:04,165
Scott: I don't even need all live sports.

349
00:26:04,245 --> 00:26:09,100
Scott: I just need you know, the incredibly major live sports that I just need hockey.

350
00:26:10,052 --> 00:26:14,100
Rym: All I need is I'm willing to pay a lot of money to just get hockey on my computer.

351
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,534
Scott: You can you can pay you can but it's they black out New York, which you don't care about.

352
00:26:18,614 --> 00:26:19,818
Rym: So I kind of care.

353
00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:22,444
Scott: well Because that's the thing.

354
00:26:22,504 --> 00:26:23,708
Scott: It's like the baseball.

355
00:26:23,728 --> 00:26:24,450
Scott: look at this, right?

356
00:26:24,832 --> 00:26:27,320
Scott: You can go to MLB TV baseball, right?

357
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:33,199
Scott: You can pay like a lot of money to get the audio of all baseball games live, right?

358
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:36,779
Scott: But they black out your local teams.

359
00:26:37,422 --> 00:26:43,680
Scott: But with an iPhone you can pay ten bucks a year and get the audio live of all games including your local teams.

360
00:26:45,101 --> 00:26:45,763
Scott: So what the fuck?

361
00:26:46,706 --> 00:26:48,712
Scott: it's from the same company Major League Baseball.

362
00:26:48,752 --> 00:26:49,975
Scott: It's not like a different company.

363
00:26:49,995 --> 00:26:51,179
Scott: It's the same people.

364
00:26:52,183 --> 00:26:56,020
Rym: See, I don't know what sports is thinking because they haven't embraced the internet yet.

365
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:58,350
Rym: But at the same time I feel like they could make a lot more.

366
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:00,780
Scott: It's like they've been there have done internet stuff.

367
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:06,540
Scott: I mean they put Sunday Night Football live streaming on NBC sports.com last year, but they haven't gone all the way.

368
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,504
Scott: They haven't gone all the way.

369
00:27:07,524 --> 00:27:12,404
Scott: I mean like the Masters golf tournament was partially on Streaming live.

370
00:27:12,444 --> 00:27:19,440
Rym: it's like you could watch like oh my god the stupid masters killed because you know We only we have like these three t1s for like useless internet.

371
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,510
Rym: So everyone was watching the master route anything that doesn't matter.

372
00:27:22,611 --> 00:27:28,133
Rym: over these three t1s and during the stupid masters They were completely utilized for the entirety.

373
00:27:28,193 --> 00:27:28,856
Scott: Everyone wants to tie.

374
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:29,600
Scott: watch Tiger Woods.

375
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,685
Scott: I mean even me.

376
00:27:30,806 --> 00:27:33,760
Scott: I don't care about golf, but it's like you see Tiger Woods.

377
00:27:34,462 --> 00:27:38,660
Rym: But plus look if I can watch that different sports have embraced it to different degrees, too.

378
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,614
Rym: And it's it's this complicated give-and-take, but and see double-a basketball.

379
00:27:42,634 --> 00:27:44,200
Scott: They put the whole tournament live streaming.

380
00:27:44,381 --> 00:27:53,860
Rym: I think the bellwether is going to if we start seeing a shift toward Ubiquitous sports coverage that is easy for people to get to and not too expensive on the internet.

381
00:27:53,981 --> 00:27:55,492
Scott: It makes sports a lot more popular.

382
00:27:55,896 --> 00:28:02,420
Rym: more to the point I think a lot of sub popular sports know them the less, you know, like hockey and f1 and all those things.

383
00:28:02,761 --> 00:28:05,153
Scott: Oh f1 f1 is streaming on the internets.

384
00:28:05,676 --> 00:28:06,319
Scott: Oh my gosh.

385
00:28:06,681 --> 00:28:12,137
Rym: Not only would they get a big boost, but I think that is the canary for the absolute end of broadcast television.

386
00:28:12,418 --> 00:28:14,203
Scott: Oh, definitely Absolutely, like.

387
00:28:14,243 --> 00:28:17,090
Rym: I think that would just destroy it because everyone wants a CSPN.

388
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:19,918
Scott: the thing is the one thing about sports though, right?

389
00:28:20,419 --> 00:28:20,720
Scott: Is that?

390
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:31,495
Scott: simultaneously with what we just said Sports are like the only thing that really needs to be in HD Like the difference between HD hockey and non HD hockey.

391
00:28:31,516 --> 00:28:39,000
Scott: if you if you look I mean Normally like people look at like an HD movie in a non HD movie and they're like think sometimes they can't even tell the difference.

392
00:28:39,442 --> 00:28:45,388
Scott: But in HD hockey, you can see more of the ice You can eat it's easier to see the puck.

393
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:49,300
Scott: There is a dramatic difference like ludicrously dramatic.

394
00:28:49,982 --> 00:28:58,972
Scott: So if you want to put it over the Internet's, you know with a packet switched You know type of situation rather than a cables kind of situation.

395
00:28:59,473 --> 00:29:01,238
Scott: You're using even more bandwidth.

396
00:29:01,619 --> 00:29:03,958
Scott: So You know for the HD.

397
00:29:04,765 --> 00:29:05,108
Rym: so see.

398
00:29:05,128 --> 00:29:17,480
Rym: at the same time if There were some sort of course cable TV could benefit from this if they use IP v6 into the multicast Even with if we just used a multicast type of infrastructure To stream live media.

399
00:29:18,126 --> 00:29:24,462
Rym: Because the live stream, you know The everyone watching it at once is the only real bandwidth problem We have left.

400
00:29:24,723 --> 00:29:33,618
Rym: if it's not a live stream if it's just you know, after the fact time shifted anything like that Peer-to-peer torrent style media distribution works beautifully.

401
00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:37,336
Rym: Yep The only thing that doesn't handle is a live stream and multicast handles that perfectly.

402
00:29:37,357 --> 00:29:40,749
Rym: Mm-hmm You can just assume that everyone no one uses multicast.

403
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:43,278
Rym: Well multicast is very difficult to use.

404
00:29:43,399 --> 00:29:51,082
Scott: Yes We should do a show on multicast technology, that's good because I don't only know, you know, the surface level things I've learned.

405
00:29:51,323 --> 00:29:55,196
Rym: we use it extensively at work and I I thought I knew a lot about it and I did.

406
00:29:55,578 --> 00:29:56,742
Rym: but I've learned a Lot more.

407
00:29:56,922 --> 00:29:57,504
Rym: that's good.

408
00:29:58,146 --> 00:29:59,611
Scott: Yeah Postgres is hard by the way.

409
00:29:59,872 --> 00:30:01,096
Rym: Yeah hard, but awesome.

410
00:30:01,256 --> 00:30:02,200
Scott: Well, it's also very hard.

411
00:30:08,924 --> 00:30:13,408
Rym: But speaking of hard things of the day Oh Thing of the day you got a thing of the day.

412
00:30:13,589 --> 00:30:15,319
Scott: Well, do you remember a while ago?

413
00:30:15,821 --> 00:30:17,927
Scott: There was this manga guide to databases.

414
00:30:18,489 --> 00:30:23,910
Rym: I do in fact, it was on slash dot or recently again real again There was something to it.

415
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:31,980
Scott: I saw it just a little while ago to remind It's been around for a few months now But it's um, basically someone made a little manga book and it was a guide to databases.

416
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:35,812
Scott: so as an educational manga about Databases and it was cute.

417
00:30:36,859 --> 00:30:40,392
Scott: I discovered something called Ubuntu.

418
00:30:40,412 --> 00:30:46,258
Scott: it is a manga guide to Ubuntu Ubuntu.

419
00:30:47,101 --> 00:30:48,506
Scott: So, how can that not be?

420
00:30:48,827 --> 00:30:51,034
Scott: how can that not be the thing of the day?

421
00:30:51,135 --> 00:30:55,560
Scott: Wow, there's an inside joke that disappeared I know right and the thing is I'm looking at like the arts.

422
00:30:56,281 --> 00:31:07,120
Scott: Pretty good for something that it's like educational whatever and it was, you know Originally done in Japanese for Japanese people and is now translated to English and it's like totally awesome.

423
00:31:07,241 --> 00:31:08,588
Rym: I think there's a big market for this.

424
00:31:08,608 --> 00:31:10,660
Scott: I hope there's a lot of Japanese people use Ubuntu.

425
00:31:11,222 --> 00:31:15,379
Rym: I hope artists get together with their tech friends and make more stuff like this.

426
00:31:16,501 --> 00:31:24,265
Scott: It's funny because I'm looking at this drawing of like some girls sitting at a desk with the computer and she sort of got this like Look and like.

427
00:31:24,325 --> 00:31:34,003
Scott: if you look at the her speech, it's all like, you know Japanese characters, but there's words like gooey Unixer Windows OS Slackware.

428
00:31:34,426 --> 00:31:35,738
Scott: open Solaris question mark.

429
00:31:37,266 --> 00:31:40,283
Scott: It's kind of funny By the way.

430
00:31:40,424 --> 00:31:42,253
Scott: open Solaris while I don't really.

431
00:31:42,273 --> 00:31:47,731
Scott: I mean Solaris is good for stuff But the main thing going on right now with open Solaris is they have.

432
00:31:47,771 --> 00:31:52,829
Scott: ZFS is by default and ZFS is like the best file System to ever exist in the history of the universe.

433
00:31:53,391 --> 00:31:58,600
Scott: and if you're running like a NAS or something Open Solaris is the win for the file servers right now.

434
00:32:00,722 --> 00:32:01,184
Rym: So I'm not.

435
00:32:01,224 --> 00:32:04,418
Rym: this isn't my thing of the day, but I just have to point it out on CollegeHumor.

436
00:32:04,438 --> 00:32:10,300
Rym: right now There's a CollegeHumor tribute to Guy Ritchie and if you don't know who that is just go to CollegeHumor and find the video.

437
00:32:11,502 --> 00:32:24,943
Rym: But no my thing of the day is that there was a man in Texas Bill Waters who for whatever reason he bought this old ledger book and he's flipping through it and it was from some pharmacy somewhere and Inside of it.

438
00:32:25,364 --> 00:32:30,160
Rym: It happened to have these interesting old formulas for a whole bunch of weird stuff.

439
00:32:30,968 --> 00:32:33,067
Rym: One of them was entitled Dr.

440
00:32:33,108 --> 00:32:35,862
Rym: Pepper's peps and bitters Mm-hmm.

441
00:32:36,022 --> 00:32:39,293
Rym: He may or may not have found one of the original formulas for either.

442
00:32:39,353 --> 00:32:39,674
Rym: Dr.

443
00:32:39,715 --> 00:32:41,785
Rym: Pepper or a Dr.

444
00:32:41,866 --> 00:32:44,221
Rym: Pepper derived Digestive.

445
00:32:45,043 --> 00:32:46,568
Scott: Well, you don't want the second one.

446
00:32:46,829 --> 00:32:47,972
Rym: You might you might.

447
00:32:48,815 --> 00:32:54,083
Scott: I think we have better digestives nowadays than they did in the olden days But I recommend.

448
00:32:54,103 --> 00:33:00,322
Rym: this is an interesting article because a lot of people don't realize that like the formula for coca-cola Dr.

449
00:33:00,362 --> 00:33:04,919
Rym: Pepper or any of these kind of old soft drinks and even a lot of new food are not patented.

450
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:13,380
Rym: and The reason they're not patented because it's when you apply for a patent You have to say what you're doing and give it to the world and then when the patent expires, it's free reign.

451
00:33:13,621 --> 00:33:16,089
Scott: Yeah, so that's the thing the difference between a patent and a copyright.

452
00:33:16,109 --> 00:33:17,553
Scott: at least practically speaking.

453
00:33:17,614 --> 00:33:19,620
Scott: right you copyright something.

454
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,205
Scott: Well, there's also trade seeker right?

455
00:33:21,225 --> 00:33:25,037
Scott: So trade secret is where you don't tell anybody anything.

456
00:33:25,077 --> 00:33:26,670
Scott: You don't copyright it You don't patent it.

457
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:27,299
Scott: You don't do shit.

458
00:33:27,701 --> 00:33:28,845
Scott: You just keep it a secret.

459
00:33:29,247 --> 00:33:32,620
Scott: and if anyone steals the secret you can be like, hey, they stole our secret, right?

460
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:33,560
Scott: Patent.

461
00:33:33,621 --> 00:33:36,008
Scott: when you patent something you say I invented this.

462
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:37,653
Scott: here are diagrams of it.

463
00:33:37,713 --> 00:33:38,896
Scott: Here's descriptions of it.

464
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:40,160
Scott: Here's the whole thing.

465
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,040
Scott: Here's my invention.

466
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:46,440
Scott: You show it to the government and the government shows it to the whole world and everyone can look it up in the patent database.

467
00:33:46,921 --> 00:33:50,051
Scott: But everyone can see it, but no one's allowed to copy it.

468
00:33:50,071 --> 00:33:50,673
Scott: for what?

469
00:33:50,673 --> 00:33:50,954
Scott: 14 years.

470
00:33:50,974 --> 00:33:53,040
Scott: I think some number of years.

471
00:33:53,141 --> 00:33:55,313
Scott: No one can copy it, but everyone can see it.

472
00:33:55,634 --> 00:33:58,145
Scott: But when the years run out Everyone can copy it.

473
00:33:58,646 --> 00:34:03,040
Scott: That's what a patent does and a copyright while we all know what a copyright does.

474
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:06,779
Scott: So, you know, they patented a lot of these things back in the day.

475
00:34:07,381 --> 00:34:15,385
Scott: so any old inventions you can copy but usually you don't want to copy an old invention unless you're steampunk in it because You got something better.

476
00:34:15,445 --> 00:34:20,587
Scott: nowadays, you know who wants to copy, you know an apple - unless you you know Really want to make one?

477
00:34:20,627 --> 00:34:22,139
Rym: Well plus I mean think I'm back then.

478
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,850
Rym: This was the you know, the early days of soda.

479
00:34:23,891 --> 00:34:28,491
Rym: when suddenly people are making soda There's soda fountains and soda juice, but those were good days.

480
00:34:28,572 --> 00:34:30,559
Scott: food never goes out of style.

481
00:34:30,579 --> 00:34:35,839
Rym: So When was the last time anyone drank moxie?

482
00:34:36,661 --> 00:34:38,389
Scott: Most food never goes out of style.

483
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:40,940
Scott: So old food is totally awesome.

484
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:46,067
Rym: Actually, you know, you know, as long as it's not the coca-cola with actual cocaine in it, you know It's big in Costa Rica.

485
00:34:46,549 --> 00:34:48,235
Rym: What tab really?

486
00:34:48,255 --> 00:34:52,456
Scott: Yeah Until you got to try that Pepsi throwback and tell me what the deal is.

487
00:34:52,658 --> 00:34:53,020
Rym: I'll try it.

488
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,246
Rym: We got to do a double-blind though.

489
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,636
Scott: Oh, you want me to do it that way?

490
00:34:55,696 --> 00:34:58,420
Scott: Yeah, we should All right, so go buy some cans or whatever.

491
00:34:58,661 --> 00:35:03,720
Scott: I'll get some throwback and then get some and then get some Pepsi also and I could regular old Pepsi.

492
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,225
Rym: I could tell the difference between the dr.

493
00:35:05,265 --> 00:35:06,650
Rym: Peppers, but I the dr.

494
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:08,215
Scott: Pepper and then we should also.

495
00:35:08,275 --> 00:35:09,660
Scott: they think it Mountain Dew throwback.

496
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,283
Scott: So we'll do both.

497
00:35:10,604 --> 00:35:13,920
Rym: but there was I don't know because Mountain Dew I don't think was ever made with sugar.

498
00:35:14,302 --> 00:35:15,889
Scott: Yeah, so they're throwing back to nothing.

499
00:35:15,909 --> 00:35:17,939
Scott: They're throwing back to what Mountain Dew would have been like.

500
00:35:19,623 --> 00:35:19,985
Scott: I don't know.

501
00:35:20,186 --> 00:35:21,072
Scott: It's a. that's all you.

502
00:35:21,132 --> 00:35:21,575
Scott: I don't.

503
00:35:21,655 --> 00:35:25,269
Scott: I don't drink the soda But I do enjoy the idea of the sugar soda.

504
00:35:25,329 --> 00:35:29,604
Rym: Mountain Dew was this weird thing because I can't stand it now It's not a good drink.

505
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:33,099
Rym: But when I was young I drank it all the time, but I didn't even really like it.

506
00:35:33,139 --> 00:35:39,631
Rym: then I drank it because it was the most caffeinated soda I knew about Not more than you didn't know about Joel.

507
00:35:39,973 --> 00:35:41,340
Scott: Well back then I know about Joel.

508
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:46,300
Rym: Joel was hard to get only the bodega was hard to get and even then my parents wouldn't let me go to the bodega.

509
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:50,200
Scott: I was like middle school and it say it was great cuz it said like 2x on it like they were bragging.

510
00:35:50,901 --> 00:35:53,980
Scott: Yeah, now where's Joel Red Bolt own them, but it was weird.

511
00:35:54,060 --> 00:36:03,411
Rym: I remember there was this culture in middle school of those kids what were hopped up on caffeine all the time and Mountain Dew was the drink of choice never would carry around like their 2-liter.

512
00:36:03,492 --> 00:36:04,114
Rym: and like.

513
00:36:04,154 --> 00:36:07,968
Rym: we made a big deal about caffeine and altoids Mmm, I guess that's what we were into.

514
00:36:08,048 --> 00:36:14,760
Rym: I don't know altoids are a big deal in high school But then we discovered kick and we thought that it had more caffeine in it.

515
00:36:15,143 --> 00:36:16,071
Rym: It tasted like ass.

516
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,084
Scott: Why don't you do penguin mints?

517
00:36:18,145 --> 00:36:19,811
Rym: There weren't penguin mints back then.

518
00:36:19,831 --> 00:36:21,920
Rym: Yeah, there were when we were in middle school.

519
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:22,682
Scott: Oh in high school.

520
00:36:22,702 --> 00:36:23,284
Scott: We had penguin mints.

521
00:36:23,304 --> 00:36:24,367
Rym: Yeah, I'm talking middle school.

522
00:36:24,508 --> 00:36:25,511
Rym: Okay high school.

523
00:36:25,812 --> 00:36:27,056
Rym: I learned about coffee.

524
00:36:27,076 --> 00:36:33,233
Scott: Uh-huh Anyway, anyway, so we're gonna do show about typing as promised.

525
00:36:33,594 --> 00:36:34,276
Rym: Yes, I sing.

526
00:36:34,516 --> 00:36:35,920
Scott: All right, so the dead?

527
00:36:36,143 --> 00:36:37,160
Rym: So if zombies attack?

528
00:36:38,105 --> 00:36:38,937
Rym: First thing you got to do

529
00:36:40,125 --> 00:36:50,355
Scott: I want to talk about learning to type first because you know Like a lot of people have a hard time learning to type and I had you know It was hard for me to learn to type, you know, I used a computer since kindergarten.

530
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:51,280
Scott: I used a computer, right?

531
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,684
Rym: How did you learn how to type.

532
00:36:52,764 --> 00:36:56,940
Rym: wait what first when did you transition from you know, trying to type to?

533
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,825
Rym: Actually typing correctly.

534
00:36:59,166 --> 00:37:02,580
Scott: Well, I mean, you know, I was hunted and pecking since kindergarten, right?

535
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,365
Scott: But I got kind of fast ish because I did it so much But it wasn't.

536
00:37:06,526 --> 00:37:14,540
Scott: I wasn't typing properly and I knew I should type properly But I just didn't and I tried to use a couple typing programs, but I never stuck to it really, you know.

537
00:37:15,302 --> 00:37:24,520
Scott: And then in high school, there was a typing class and I eventually got around to taking it I don't know if I've told the story in the show before and the teacher was this old lady.

538
00:37:24,902 --> 00:37:38,674
Scott: She was so old and she was sort of crazy Right, but and it was this computer lab full of IBM xt's like the oldest possible IBM's in the universe and they're these giant clickety clickety keyboards.

539
00:37:38,895 --> 00:37:43,109
Scott: and like I was I Took the last time that class was ever given.

540
00:37:43,129 --> 00:37:45,597
Scott: the lady retired and they got rid of the computer lab.

541
00:37:45,657 --> 00:37:47,571
Scott: right after I took that Class I was like, whoo?

542
00:37:48,620 --> 00:38:05,880
Scott: But I took that class and we went in and they had you know a silly little typing program, you know Where you would you know, it's like there'd be like a little race car, you know on some five and a quarter inch floppy disk And you'd type in the race car would go and we had like it is incredibly incredibly old Microsoft Word.

543
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:10,617
Scott: we would type in you know in this incredibly blocky font and you know stuff like that.

544
00:38:10,718 --> 00:38:21,695
Scott: and just Doing it going to that class every day, you know five days a week and sticking to it Like suddenly I didn't even realize you know that I was like, oh shit.

545
00:38:21,735 --> 00:38:22,257
Scott: I'm typing.

546
00:38:22,418 --> 00:38:24,123
Scott: Oh shit Yes, I got it.

547
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:34,960
Scott: You know, it's like I was thinking hard about it, you know for a while like, okay that letters over here That letter this finger in that direction and I still don't type a hundred percent properly.

548
00:38:35,141 --> 00:38:37,569
Scott: I mean, I never used the right shift ever.

549
00:38:37,589 --> 00:38:38,873
Scott: I know I'm supposed to.

550
00:38:38,933 --> 00:38:39,857
Scott: I just don't really.

551
00:38:39,877 --> 00:38:40,880
Scott: I never use right shift.

552
00:38:40,961 --> 00:38:42,460
Scott: I always use left shift for everything.

553
00:38:43,022 --> 00:38:54,640
Scott: So if I'm like gonna type an uppercase a I'll move my ring finger all the way over to the a. you know Also like up in the middle area up in the top in the middle where the index fingers go like in the TU area.

554
00:38:55,242 --> 00:39:00,420
Scott: You know, I always like sometimes my fingers will cross over to the other side.

555
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:06,580
Scott: It's like I'll use the left index and I should use the right index and vice versa sometimes and also the numbers above.

556
00:39:07,183 --> 00:39:11,140
Scott: You know the the numpad numbers I can type, you know, I take my hand to put on the numpad.

557
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,165
Scott: I can type like crazy.

558
00:39:12,608 --> 00:39:18,888
Scott: but the numbers above the letters I have to look sometimes or feel around or I'll hit the wrong one sometimes.

559
00:39:19,389 --> 00:39:20,752
Scott: but other than that I type, you know.

560
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:32,160
Rym: See I never really took typing classes like they had it in my school and when I was in like fifth grade We had to do these kind of exercises.

561
00:39:32,702 --> 00:39:41,880
Rym: They they had this thing called computer class and I think that was when I realized that pretty much no one Anywhere near me in the world at that time knew anything about computers.

562
00:39:42,161 --> 00:39:47,980
Scott: I learned that in kindergarten when you know, I could play word but the teacher didn't know how to play word much.

563
00:39:48,402 --> 00:39:54,848
Rym: I never owned a computer of my own and I found the word much is debug menu until my 486 SX to 486 DX.

564
00:39:55,009 --> 00:39:57,400
Rym: for but well, I guess it felt my Atari.

565
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,773
Scott: But anyway, but I remember tired 7800 is not a computer.

566
00:40:00,853 --> 00:40:04,555
Rym: They would take technically it is I guess Yeah, they would take me my time.

567
00:40:04,615 --> 00:40:05,180
Rym: X was a computer.

568
00:40:05,281 --> 00:40:08,419
Rym: I'll go into this room and it had all these old computers on the wall.

569
00:40:08,841 --> 00:40:15,968
Rym: I never would set a computer and log in by typing your name But if my name was screwed up because there's a space in my name so I would only type the first two letters.

570
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:20,849
Rym: if I typed anything else it would crash and Then it would ask us questions.

571
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:22,919
Rym: Like what's four plus five?

572
00:40:23,848 --> 00:40:24,879
Rym: What color is this?

573
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,605
Rym: What color is that?

574
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:34,400
Rym: and every now and then it'd be this typing exercise Which was just type the sentence you're looking at and if you don't type the right letter nothing happens.

575
00:40:35,082 --> 00:40:36,848
Rym: Mm-hmm, and it was awful.

576
00:40:36,868 --> 00:40:38,012
Rym: I don't learn how to type.

577
00:40:38,032 --> 00:40:40,000
Scott: that's not gonna help you learn to type not at all.

578
00:40:40,744 --> 00:40:43,500
Rym: When I really learned how to type was when I finally got my computer.

579
00:40:43,701 --> 00:40:47,940
Rym: I got online and I was hanging out in prodigy chat room No shit.

580
00:40:48,141 --> 00:40:52,820
Rym: And I wanted to say stuff to people and I had to say stuff quickly or I'd be get left behind.

581
00:40:53,603 --> 00:40:58,560
Rym: I learned how to type very very rapidly just by actually having to type to do other things.

582
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:02,073
Rym: It's the I find my whole life and I think this applies to all technology.

583
00:41:02,475 --> 00:41:05,586
Rym: if you want to learn a technology Don't try to learn that technology.

584
00:41:05,887 --> 00:41:09,440
Rym: try to do something with that technology and you'll learn it as a course.

585
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,337
Rym: I'm just doing it.

586
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:16,987
Scott: But the other thing is, you know, if you you know, a lot of people like, you know They'll say I want to learn Python or something, right?

587
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:20,640
Scott: So they'll be like, okay, and they'll go about learning it.

588
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,548
Scott: It's like no, no, no, that doesn't that doesn't work.

589
00:41:22,588 --> 00:41:25,440
Scott: You need to have a need for it to learn, you know.

590
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:27,480
Scott: It's like I want to learn how to swing a hammer.

591
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:39,700
Scott: Well, I hope you have something you're gonna make that needs hammering and it has to be something you actually want to make and not Just you know some board with a bunch of nails in it for the purpose of hammering, you know It has to be a real thing that you want.

592
00:41:40,102 --> 00:41:42,411
Scott: So that requires you to learn the skill.

593
00:41:42,431 --> 00:41:47,000
Scott: if you're not required to learn the skill It's gonna be very difficult to learn the skill for reals.

594
00:41:48,043 --> 00:41:55,720
Scott: And now the other thing something I've realized right is That you know, it's funny that you talk about how you learn to type from a chat room, right?

595
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,511
Scott: But if you look around the world today majority people don't.

596
00:41:59,832 --> 00:42:09,740
Scott: well, I think what it is is that You know, we talk about like AOL speaks, you know, like lol, you know They're tech speak or whatever the fuck you want to call it.

597
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:15,619
Scott: Basically, you know not typing properly not spelling things using like the letter U instead of you

598
00:42:16,324 --> 00:42:23,800
Rym: I always felt even when I was a young kid I always felt like people who typed like that were just solving a problem in the wrong way like the price of the problem.

599
00:42:24,202 --> 00:42:28,700
Rym: I cannot type fast enough to say what I want to say quickly solution type shittier.

600
00:42:29,041 --> 00:42:36,400
Scott: Yeah, I mean I sort of realized like, you know people sort of get this idea that that text speak AOL speak kind of typing.

601
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:44,802
Scott: You know where you leave out all these vowels and use the letter R instead of ARE is because of bad grammar or lack of Intelligence?

602
00:42:45,284 --> 00:42:45,826
Scott: it's not.

603
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:49,280
Scott: it's simply because of bad typing skills.

604
00:42:49,481 --> 00:42:51,628
Scott: All right, and it has nothing to do with age either.

605
00:42:51,708 --> 00:42:53,675
Scott: I mean my grandma right?

606
00:42:54,097 --> 00:42:55,020
Scott: She doesn't know how to type.

607
00:42:55,221 --> 00:42:56,547
Scott: She can't type for hilla beans.

608
00:42:56,608 --> 00:43:00,465
Scott: And the only thing she really knows how to use is, you know GM or pigeon to.

609
00:43:00,585 --> 00:43:01,207
Scott: I am people.

610
00:43:01,488 --> 00:43:05,160
Scott: that's all she knows how to do right and she refuses to learn anything else.

611
00:43:05,501 --> 00:43:08,656
Scott: so we just sort of given up on her and she's stubborn and impatient.

612
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:20,679
Scott: but When she types she'll type like the letter U and it's not because she's some 13 year old kid it's because she wants to send you the message quickly and she can't type.

613
00:43:20,699 --> 00:43:28,440
Scott: and You know, even an old person will naturally arrive at that solution without, you know hearing of that solution from anyone else.

614
00:43:28,781 --> 00:43:34,280
Scott: She wasn't influenced by anyone else typing like that to her or seeing anyone else talk like that.

615
00:43:34,621 --> 00:43:39,180
Scott: She arrived there on her own, you know, and you're typing on like a cell phone, you know.

616
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:43,814
Scott: And it doesn't have a full keyboard like a blackberry or even if it does it's hard to type.

617
00:43:44,456 --> 00:43:55,650
Scott: and that's why people you know When they're texting not just because of the character limit, but also because of that but because About that about why it's the number of characters that it is.

618
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:56,452
Rym: It's fascinating.

619
00:43:56,472 --> 00:43:56,632
Scott: Yeah.

620
00:43:56,672 --> 00:43:59,260
Scott: Well, it's because texts go on like this sideband.

621
00:43:59,441 --> 00:44:01,560
Scott: It's like it's it's in the routing protocol.

622
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:07,978
Rym: No, it talks about the magic number of you know, how many characters you need on average to form complete sentences?

623
00:44:07,998 --> 00:44:09,427
Rym: Oh Yeah, there's.

624
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:16,879
Scott: there's an interesting article You see because the other thing the other interesting technological thing is that text messages aren't actually sent on their own.

625
00:44:16,899 --> 00:44:25,178
Rym: Yes That's why that's why the article is so fascinating because it talks about how they it would have just been 128 characters because that was perfect for the sideband they had.

626
00:44:25,198 --> 00:44:29,833
Rym: yeah But it turned out that the magic number for typing sentences.

627
00:44:29,853 --> 00:44:42,217
Rym: a guy just sat down and wrote all these random Sentences whatever he was thinking of and he counted the characters and he decided that 128 characters Prevents you from saying anything meaningful, but a hundred and sixty was this magic number.

628
00:44:42,237 --> 00:44:45,794
Rym: Uh-huh Yeah, but yet the I didn't read the whole article.

629
00:44:45,834 --> 00:44:46,920
Rym: So I'm going based on slash.

630
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,253
Scott: We'll talk about text messages themselves.

631
00:44:49,273 --> 00:44:49,816
Scott: We should do a show.

632
00:44:49,876 --> 00:44:50,158
Scott: I don't know.

633
00:44:50,198 --> 00:44:51,220
Rym: effort show Yeah, whatever.

634
00:44:51,381 --> 00:44:58,707
Rym: But one thing I really find interesting is that when I first got online like really not prodigy, you know and all those chat rooms the BBS is.

635
00:44:58,767 --> 00:45:09,965
Rym: but when I got ICQ back in the day when While they're probably were shit cockers there weren't nearly as many because there was a barrier to entry and I'm not saying the barrier to Entries you'd come back.

636
00:45:10,468 --> 00:45:11,716
Rym: It's just you know, it was different time.

637
00:45:11,736 --> 00:45:19,964
Rym: you understand 1987 88 like 1997 98 that's more likely but nobody typed like that.

638
00:45:20,204 --> 00:45:31,240
Rym: the only people who typed in that kind of halting lead speak any of that stuff were the idiots and Everyone like when I was online, you know talking to people in ICQ just going into random chat rooms.

639
00:45:31,702 --> 00:45:37,273
Rym: It was, you know begin sentences with uppercase letters end them with punctuation semicolons.

640
00:45:38,462 --> 00:45:42,422
Scott: Yeah, I mean it's simply a matter of typing skill, you know It's like.

641
00:45:42,522 --> 00:45:44,551
Scott: I knew plenty of people that are actually like.

642
00:45:44,751 --> 00:45:54,759
Scott: you'll see executives type, you know Like emailing really stupidly and it's not because they're stupid It's because they can't type for shit and they can't be bothered to sit there.

643
00:45:55,081 --> 00:46:03,399
Scott: You know doing the one finger jabs to write this gigantic essay, you know There for days kind of randomly faster than to write with a pen.

644
00:46:03,862 --> 00:46:11,687
Rym: I was I was writing documentation for our internal wiki and I use the acronym WYSIWYG a bunch of times and I realized that I can type.

645
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:14,280
Rym: what you see is what you get faster than I can type WYSIWYG.

646
00:46:15,081 --> 00:46:15,804
Scott: It's about the same.

647
00:46:15,824 --> 00:46:19,620
Rym: I cuz I have to stop and think about what letters are in WYSIWYG because it's not.

648
00:46:20,306 --> 00:46:27,280
Rym: Yeah, it's not an acronym WYSIWYG It's not an acronym that works for the letters in my brain.

649
00:46:27,381 --> 00:46:30,420
Rym: It works as like this one phenom like this word WYSIWYG.

650
00:46:30,802 --> 00:46:33,115
Rym: So when I have to type it, it's a lot easier to type.

651
00:46:33,155 --> 00:46:33,960
Rym: what you see is what you get.

652
00:46:34,321 --> 00:46:36,309
Rym: Yep, exactly, and it bothered me.

653
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:36,991
Scott: Mm-hmm.

654
00:46:37,393 --> 00:46:39,260
Scott: now something else about typing, right?

655
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:41,334
Scott: I mean we've done shows on keyboards before.

656
00:46:41,676 --> 00:46:57,009
Scott: but like I said I learned on the IBM XT and I actually think that if you're going to learn to type You should try to find an IBM XT keyboard Which it is possible to make an IBM XT keyboard work With a modern computer.

657
00:46:57,029 --> 00:46:58,255
Rym: I mean, I have the DOS keyboard.

658
00:46:58,476 --> 00:46:59,180
Scott: That's pretty close.

659
00:46:59,725 --> 00:47:00,898
Rym: I love this thing so much.

660
00:47:01,361 --> 00:47:07,860
Scott: Then the main thing about the reasons the XT or a similar keyboard are good for learning to type on is number one.

661
00:47:08,323 --> 00:47:10,420
Scott: The buttons are hard to push down.

662
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:13,692
Scott: Relatively speaking they have a lot of tactile feedback.

663
00:47:13,712 --> 00:47:17,190
Scott: They click they snap, you know There's a lot of space between.

664
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:20,020
Rym: the tactile feedback is key If you want to be a touch typist, right?

665
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:24,720
Rym: I mean, have you ever tried to type on a non feedback keyboard at all?

666
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:27,067
Rym: Like one of those solid surfaces with capacitance.

667
00:47:27,448 --> 00:47:30,036
Scott: Yeah, like you type, you know, like on a table.

668
00:47:30,117 --> 00:47:31,180
Scott: you ever seen that like keyboard?

669
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:34,517
Scott: That's like a laser thing that you know draws a keyboard on the table.

670
00:47:34,538 --> 00:47:34,940
Scott: with a laser.

671
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:44,908
Rym: I mean the thing where for like 10 years every on the internet you kept seeing pictures of a company saying Yeah, we know you can buy it But it's now you can but for a long time you couldn't.

672
00:47:45,069 --> 00:47:50,398
Rym: but even like these pictures of it and people saying yes We made it it's coming out next week and then it never.

673
00:47:50,418 --> 00:47:54,540
Scott: yeah But I try to learn like, you know how to type on a laptop keyboard, right?

674
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:56,970
Scott: It's hard to feel your way around.

675
00:47:57,010 --> 00:47:58,074
Scott: the whole thing is flat.

676
00:47:58,135 --> 00:47:59,400
Scott: It's not at an angle, right?

677
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:04,040
Scott: I mean if you learn how to type already you can type on a laptop keyboard.

678
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:10,220
Scott: But learning to type on a laptop keyboard is asking for trouble because you're not getting all this help.

679
00:48:10,702 --> 00:48:19,680
Scott: You know in in, you know that teaches your fingers, you know an initial D. They talk about the hachi roku is the car that teaches you how to race because the car gives you all this feedback.

680
00:48:19,841 --> 00:48:20,784
Scott: It's an old piece of junk.

681
00:48:20,804 --> 00:48:31,691
Scott: All right, but the old piece of junk, you know by just by driving it You can sort of feel things out and learn things where if you started by driving a Ferrari You wouldn't be able to learn those things.

682
00:48:31,711 --> 00:48:33,060
Scott: you would just die, right?

683
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:50,180
Scott: So if you're learning to type you should type on like a really really standard keyboard with you know big You know keys that are far apart standard size, you know Hopefully very springy and clicky if possible, you know, not mushy and comfortable.

684
00:48:50,381 --> 00:48:52,779
Rym: But then again, I learned how to type without any of that.

685
00:48:53,341 --> 00:48:58,415
Scott: Yeah, and that's why you don't but you don't type properly according to the correct typing way.

686
00:48:58,515 --> 00:49:00,360
Rym: actually type with perfect home row now.

687
00:49:00,661 --> 00:49:01,082
Scott: Oh really?

688
00:49:01,143 --> 00:49:05,399
Scott: Cuz you used to you know, give you some bullshit like oh I typed with some made-up met that I made up.

689
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:06,520
Rym: now I didn't make up a method.

690
00:49:07,203 --> 00:49:14,160
Rym: I noticed that when I used to type partly because the way I would always sit because you know, no lessons I learned to type just because I was in chat room.

691
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:19,360
Scott: Yeah, you didn't you didn't learn, you know, according to the you know The rules of typing you just learned a natural method of your hand.

692
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:21,448
Rym: but my natural method was fast.

693
00:49:21,508 --> 00:49:27,520
Rym: and the real point I want to make is that if you want to learn how to type the Most foolproof way is to never take shortcuts

694
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:28,622
Scott: Mm-hmm

695
00:49:28,702 --> 00:49:33,260
Rym: because I always typed in complete sentences and I typed with perfect grammar and I thought a lot about what I was saying.

696
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:41,120
Rym: So as a result, I was forced to either type very very slowly and be frustrated all the time or get faster very quickly.

697
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:46,620
Scott: Yep, you know, I mean if you type in complete sentences the correct grammar, right and all these things.

698
00:49:46,961 --> 00:49:50,754
Scott: You're actually gonna force yourselves to use all the keys on the keyboard.

699
00:49:50,815 --> 00:49:51,738
Scott: Not just a few of them.

700
00:49:51,778 --> 00:49:56,520
Scott: more often You know, so you're gonna be forced to use, you know, the shift key to capitalize.

701
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:03,226
Scott: You're gonna be forced to use like the periods and the commas down low and the question marks and you know if you code that's even better.

702
00:50:03,246 --> 00:50:09,449
Scott: because you're gonna be forced to use the curly braces and the back slashes and the Asterisks and the who knows what right.

703
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:17,940
Scott: and by forcing yourself to use more of the keys You'll be better at typing if you only if the less keys you use the less typing skill you'll have.

704
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:20,133
Rym: But what I used to do, you know, you you said I had a method.

705
00:50:20,153 --> 00:50:20,395
Rym: I didn't.

706
00:50:20,415 --> 00:50:29,340
Rym: it was just that I Tended to always be at this angle from the keyboard just because I sat like I Just kind of as slouched as possible like sideways in the chair.

707
00:50:29,902 --> 00:50:31,690
Rym: So the keyboard was at an angle to my hands.

708
00:50:32,092 --> 00:50:34,080
Rym: So my hands kind of just read an angle to the keyboard.

709
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:39,298
Rym: I always typed with the keyboard at like a 30-degree angle counterclockwise Mm-hmm.

710
00:50:39,441 --> 00:50:41,140
Rym: So as a result my hands like floated.

711
00:50:41,642 --> 00:50:48,537
Rym: But I realized later that this is why I respect home row printing or piping so much And why I think you should learn home row if you can.

712
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:58,520
Rym: Naturally while my hands kind of floated and I was at this angle my two index fingers Naturally always ended up hovering over where they should have been in the home row.

713
00:50:58,982 --> 00:51:04,909
Rym: It's just that my whole hand pivoted left and right with the pinky finger on the other end Mm-hmm, but it's still like.

714
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:10,120
Rym: completely naturally and without instruction I gravitated toward the home row because it is the most efficient way to type.

715
00:51:10,381 --> 00:51:13,060
Scott: Yeah, and the other thing is you know the home row, right?

716
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:21,299
Scott: You know this little nubs on the F and the J usually some keyboards like maybe the D and the K But mostly the F and the J for you to you know.

717
00:51:21,601 --> 00:51:25,620
Scott: So that way without looking you can feel where to put your hands.

718
00:51:25,841 --> 00:51:28,080
Scott: You know because you feel these little nubs on two of the keys.

719
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:40,016
Scott: That's where you put your index fingers And I think that's a big thing is not looking and if you have to get a keyboard that doesn't have any letters on it So you can't look and I think that will really help you.

720
00:51:40,076 --> 00:51:50,379
Scott: if you have a you know I mean it takes some willpower if you're especially if you're used to looking to not look You know and it took me like a couple weeks to like you know stop looking you know.

721
00:51:52,082 --> 00:52:04,049
Scott: So if you're having trouble learning you know because you keep looking Get a blank keyboard and that goes and force yourself to use it and throw and block up all your other Keyboards in a closet or something or very easily.

722
00:52:04,069 --> 00:52:06,800
Rym: if you can't get a blank keyboard just get a Dvorak keyboard.

723
00:52:07,948 --> 00:52:09,645
Scott: Oh, yeah, yeah Get a Dvorak keyboard.

724
00:52:09,665 --> 00:52:15,167
Scott: or like pluck the keys off your keyboard and move them all around Because you can take keys off most keyboards

725
00:52:15,267 --> 00:52:18,678
Rym: on most keyboards not for a long time the old IBM ones you could

726
00:52:18,999 --> 00:52:23,414
Scott: yeah But I don't know Normal the kind of keyboard that I suggested you should be learning on.

727
00:52:23,835 --> 00:52:26,254
Rym: you can take the keys off But those keyboards aren't that common.

728
00:52:26,538 --> 00:52:27,605
Scott: yeah But take the key.

729
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:30,300
Scott: if you can take the keys off and shuffle them around.

730
00:52:30,702 --> 00:52:32,511
Scott: That way you can't look because looking won't

731
00:52:32,552 --> 00:52:42,893
Rym: help you see but at the same time Looking works just fine for me early on learning because I kind of I was trying to type quickly so I'd stare at the T keyboard and I kind of watch what my hands were doing and think about what they were doing.

732
00:52:42,913 --> 00:52:52,578
Scott: see something else that actually helps is If you keep looking down right because the idea is you don't just get efficiency from being able to type quickly.

733
00:52:52,598 --> 00:52:57,954
Scott: you get Efficiency from being able to look at the screen while typing right.

734
00:52:58,195 --> 00:53:03,320
Scott: let's say you know how to type real fast But you have to look right so you'll look down at your hands.

735
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:04,399
Scott: You know type a whole sentence.

736
00:53:04,801 --> 00:53:07,131
Scott: Then you'll look up and then see the typo.

737
00:53:07,312 --> 00:53:09,100
Scott: then you have to go back and edit the typo.

738
00:53:09,542 --> 00:53:20,120
Scott: But if you're looking while typing you'll see the typo when it appears and you'll Backspace it real quick with your typing skills and the sentence will be correct in a much faster amount of time.

739
00:53:20,722 --> 00:53:25,820
Scott: So what you can do if you're having trouble looking and you can't shuffle the keys or get a blank keyboard?

740
00:53:26,561 --> 00:53:30,411
Scott: Get an on-screen just like a graphic of the keyboard on the screen.

741
00:53:30,892 --> 00:53:33,620
Scott: that way your eyes will at least be on the screen.

742
00:53:34,222 --> 00:53:38,539
Scott: You won't have to look down at the keyboard because you have a reminder on the screen of where the keys are.

743
00:53:38,941 --> 00:53:41,956
Rym: That is an absolutely fantastic way to learn how to type.

744
00:53:42,037 --> 00:53:42,680
Scott: It's very good.

745
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:44,086
Scott: That's most typing programs.

746
00:53:44,126 --> 00:53:48,123
Scott: have a picture of the keyboard on the screen in the early phases You know.

747
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:51,959
Rym: for that very reason actually I have one other really important hint.

748
00:53:52,840 --> 00:54:02,860
Rym: Don't you at least when you're trying to learn how to type for computer stuff as much as possible early on Don't use the numbers at the top use your right hand only on the numpad and learn ten key typing?

749
00:54:03,001 --> 00:54:03,948
Scott: Yes, you should be.

750
00:54:03,988 --> 00:54:05,540
Rym: typing will save your ass.

751
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:17,965
Scott: You definitely want to learn how to type on the numpad to do like a whole bunch of numbers Like I use it all the time for example like I use list all right and I buy get a bunch of books in the mail and then I want to enter them all in With the ISBN numbers.

752
00:54:18,548 --> 00:54:22,299
Scott: if I wasn't using the numpad, you know, how long that would take like forever.

753
00:54:23,122 --> 00:54:24,092
Scott: So but I use the numpad.

754
00:54:24,153 --> 00:54:24,800
Scott: He says like did it?

755
00:54:25,361 --> 00:54:25,943
Rym: That's the one thing.

756
00:54:25,983 --> 00:54:30,320
Rym: I was actually trained in ten key because my first job was for the US Census doing payroll.

757
00:54:31,023 --> 00:54:35,200
Scott: So I would type in everyone's time sheets, yeah, I mean a lot of keyboards today don't have the numpad.

758
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:47,480
Scott: I mean, I don't have a numpad on my keyboard, but I have a separate numpad because Sometimes you just have to enter in a bunch of numbers, you know And if you're gonna enter in a bunch of numbers a spreadsheet or something.

759
00:54:48,143 --> 00:54:58,080
Scott: the numpad is just so much faster like times a bajillion and It's something you know, you might not use it often, but when you're using it, it's so helpful.

760
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:04,235
Scott: You really numpad typing is almost as important as the regular keyboard typing and you should learn that too.

761
00:55:04,295 --> 00:55:04,916
Scott: Don't neglect it.

762
00:55:04,936 --> 00:55:07,848
Rym: I Really don't recommend typing games.

763
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:11,389
Rym: They diving typing in the dead is fun But at the same time you're gonna be.

764
00:55:11,409 --> 00:55:13,340
Rym: you know, I've seen there seems well, they're good.

765
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:15,307
Scott: They're not good for learning to type.

766
00:55:15,568 --> 00:55:18,760
Scott: they're good for you know, maintaining your typing skills.

767
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:27,940
Rym: But at the same time I feel like I see two different kinds of good typists and they're the people who type like 110 words a minute, but they make a mistake every other word.

768
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,700
Rym: They're just so fast that they make up for all the mistakes constantly by backspacing.

769
00:55:32,342 --> 00:55:36,954
Rym: And then there are people who type like 70 words a minute, but they never make mistakes ever.

770
00:55:37,234 --> 00:55:37,455
Scott: Yep.

771
00:55:38,297 --> 00:55:39,340
Rym: I'm in the former category.

772
00:55:39,421 --> 00:55:45,175
Rym: I'll type like 120 words a minute But you'll see me like backspacing like at least once in every word.

773
00:55:45,597 --> 00:55:47,343
Scott: mine sort of you know My with me.

774
00:55:47,403 --> 00:55:54,879
Scott: it varies like if I'm typing something that's not too long like, you know Maybe I am or a tweet or a forum post.

775
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:56,666
Scott: 99% of the time.

776
00:55:56,686 --> 00:56:02,020
Scott: it'll be a hundred percent correct and it won't be so fast But it'll be you know fast real fast.

777
00:56:02,721 --> 00:56:08,501
Scott: But I go on typing something big like a blog post or an essay or something Like.

778
00:56:08,522 --> 00:56:12,800
Scott: I'll type as fast or even faster than the ideas come into my brain.

779
00:56:13,281 --> 00:56:17,938
Scott: But when I go back over it, they'll be miss, you know, four or five mistakes, you know every.

780
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:18,139
Scott: you know.

781
00:56:18,701 --> 00:56:21,048
Scott: Mistake per paragraph you wanted.

782
00:56:21,129 --> 00:56:25,272
Rym: as long as you can type faster than you can think of what you want to type You're good to go.

783
00:56:25,293 --> 00:56:29,537
Scott: Yeah Then you're not limited in any way, you know, you know 120 words a minute.

784
00:56:30,241 --> 00:56:33,900
Rym: I'm not going to be thinking of a hundred and twenty useful words to type in a minute.

785
00:56:34,282 --> 00:56:37,200
Rym: That's only useful if you're doing something like transcribing.

786
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:44,512
Scott: Yeah transcribing and that's the reason a lot of people have Transcribers still like lawyers and like old lawyers and people like.

787
00:56:44,532 --> 00:56:46,680
Scott: that is because you know, they're from the olden days.

788
00:56:47,101 --> 00:56:53,360
Scott: They never typed they need to get lots of words onto paper, but they don't have any typing skills and they have.

789
00:56:54,222 --> 00:56:54,925
Rym: You know that dr.

790
00:56:54,945 --> 00:56:56,209
Rym: Pepper thing I was talking about.

791
00:56:56,349 --> 00:56:59,900
Rym: Yeah, the biggest trouble they're having is that no one can read the handwriting in the ledger.

792
00:57:00,801 --> 00:57:02,709
Rym: It's all in cursive and no one can read it.

793
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:19,879
Scott: Damn, we can read ancient tablets of stone with Sanskrit on them, but we can't read the dr Pepper, you know the way you said that I expected you to say ancient spirits of evil Transform this decade form into legible handwriting.

794
00:57:24,462 --> 00:57:26,451
Rym: Okay, I don't know what else we can say about typing.

795
00:57:26,511 --> 00:57:27,154
Rym: learn to type.

796
00:57:27,496 --> 00:57:29,786
Scott: yeah everyone, you know You should really learn to type.

797
00:57:30,028 --> 00:57:35,971
Scott: and you know, I think actually here Here's an incentive to learn to type right if you think about it in our forum.

798
00:57:36,413 --> 00:57:44,640
Scott: We demand you know Excellent grammar and spelling, you know, we're not super perfect demanding, but it's got to be good.

799
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:48,135
Scott: You know, none of this, you know normal internet crap, right?

800
00:57:48,617 --> 00:58:02,296
Scott: The thing is the reason that we demand that is not because we you know want excellent grammar and spelling but because if you're forced to have excellent grammar and spelling you'll be forced to think about what you're typing and thus you'll make better posts.

801
00:58:02,718 --> 00:58:10,679
Scott: and if a post is Poopy and crappy you won't even bother and thus the overall, you know signal-to-noise ratio of quality on the forum will be up.

802
00:58:11,301 --> 00:58:17,720
Scott: But if you learn to type right you won't have to think so much about typing a whole bunch of stuff in the forum.

803
00:58:17,882 --> 00:58:27,760
Scott: so If you learn to type you can post a bunch of crap and probably get away with it Because you're gonna have great grammar and spelling and a big long post and type a bunch of bullshit.

804
00:58:28,301 --> 00:58:30,809
Scott: But if you're typing in space for typing is bad.

805
00:58:31,451 --> 00:58:34,240
Scott: You're gonna and it's gonna take you forever to type a bunch of bullshit.

806
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:40,344
Scott: So it's getting much more difficult for you to make low quality posts Especially fanboy pose.

807
00:58:40,364 --> 00:58:49,155
Scott: Yeah, so being a fanboy with typing skills you have you have this Incredible dangerous power to spread stupidity at greater speeds.

808
00:58:49,376 --> 00:59:03,644
Rym: actually some of the greatest fun I had was that back in the day with ICQ you could you can either type and people would see what you were typing in real time, which was the default or You could have it to where you could type your message and then hit enter and then it would go or alt enter in my case.

809
00:59:03,685 --> 00:59:04,029
Rym: Mm-hmm.

810
00:59:04,556 --> 00:59:10,470
Rym: So Everyone I knew had it set to where I could see what they were typing, but they didn't realize that was what was going on.

811
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:19,930
Rym: so both a lot of people typed so slowly that they would start to like say something like ask a question and I would Answer the question before they sent it.

812
00:59:19,950 --> 00:59:25,271
Rym: Mm-hmm You would not believe the amount of mayhem I could cause.

813
00:59:25,391 --> 00:59:28,219
Rym: I convinced a large number of people that I had psychic powers.

814
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:41,860
Scott: Wow a large number is four or five but still Yeah You know, I think the other thing to say is that you know keyboards, right?

815
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,120
Scott: I mean computers have been around for a while and just about every aspect of them is improved.

816
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,126
Scott: We invented the mouse.

817
00:59:47,427 --> 00:59:49,640
Scott: we upgraded to the optical mouse the laser mouse.

818
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:50,865
Scott: We put more buttons on the mouse.

819
00:59:51,146 --> 00:59:52,150
Scott: the mouse is evolving.

820
00:59:52,472 --> 00:59:56,264
Scott: The keyboard is evolving a little bit, you know They're moving the keys around.

821
00:59:56,525 --> 01:00:02,298
Scott: some of the keyboards are getting stupid, you know, but really the keyboard is not going anywhere.

822
01:00:02,318 --> 01:00:04,044
Scott: and You know, it's.

823
01:00:04,144 --> 01:00:06,754
Scott: it's like the mouse doesn't take much learning to.

824
01:00:06,895 --> 01:00:09,717
Scott: you know master, you know It's sort of intuitive in a way.

825
01:00:10,522 --> 01:00:13,712
Scott: The keyboard needs mastery and it's not going anywhere.

826
01:00:13,913 --> 01:00:16,220
Scott: The keyboard is gonna be around for a long.

827
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:18,927
Rym: Longevity is evidence of its efficiency.

828
01:00:18,987 --> 01:00:19,288
Scott: Yes.

829
01:00:19,730 --> 01:00:21,094
Scott: The keyboard is not going anywhere.

830
01:00:21,134 --> 01:00:22,800
Scott: It's been around since the typewriter.

831
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:29,893
Scott: It's gonna be around for at least another decade or two though I do have to say all the it's not more almost every improvement.

832
01:00:29,913 --> 01:00:30,154
Rym: I've said.

833
01:00:30,174 --> 01:00:31,560
Rym: well quote unquote improvement.

834
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:32,605
Rym: I've seen two keyboards.

835
01:00:33,408 --> 01:00:35,036
Rym: It's not actually improvement in my opinion.

836
01:00:35,056 --> 01:00:37,006
Rym: like those split keyboards I feel like no good.

837
01:00:37,349 --> 01:00:39,020
Rym: All they do is slow you down and hurt your wrist.

838
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:52,820
Scott: You know I have the happy hacking keyboard and the improvements it makes are the escape key is closer because I hit it very often because I Use vim which is not useful for most people who barely ever hit escape escape colon right percent sign.

839
01:00:53,701 --> 01:00:56,975
Scott: There's a control instead of a caps lock, which is nice.

840
01:00:57,498 --> 01:01:01,320
Rym: Yeah Of course, do we really need pause anymore?

841
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:03,649
Scott: No, but we don't.

842
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:06,000
Rym: and who in the world types in insert mode?

843
01:01:07,563 --> 01:01:13,536
Rym: Well, the insert key is useful for other things Yes, but in many things that I do like if I'm in Word, I accidentally hit that key.

844
01:01:13,556 --> 01:01:14,620
Rym: I'm fucked.

845
01:01:15,164 --> 01:01:23,520
Rym: Yeah, that has never been useful to me No, but like shift insert like is paste in something and whatever the other thing I really need to get out here.

846
01:01:24,202 --> 01:01:27,716
Rym: I had arguments at work about this and one because I'm on the right side.

847
01:01:27,796 --> 01:01:28,559
Rym: Scott agrees with me.

848
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:34,080
Rym: Don't learn anything but QWERTY unless you speak a foreign language and have to use a foreign keyboard.

849
01:01:34,341 --> 01:01:36,026
Rym: QWERTY is the only worthwhile keyboard.

850
01:01:36,046 --> 01:01:38,193
Rym: Dvorak is absolute gibberish.

851
01:01:38,575 --> 01:01:39,197
Rym: It's useless.

852
01:01:39,457 --> 01:01:40,180
Rym: It's not better.

853
01:01:40,502 --> 01:01:42,453
Rym: Anyone says it's better ask them for evidence.

854
01:01:42,635 --> 01:01:43,520
Rym: There's no evidence.

855
01:01:43,881 --> 01:01:49,320
Rym: It's this minority thing the only people who use two people who think it's cool or rationalize some bullshit reason for using it.

856
01:01:49,701 --> 01:02:00,030
Scott: They just want to be different and they think it's better because they're like, oh look They took the most frequently used things and put them right near the index finger To be different, but they don't want to admit that.

857
01:02:00,110 --> 01:02:02,397
Rym: so they rationalize why they're different.

858
01:02:02,478 --> 01:02:03,180
Scott: that's correct.

859
01:02:03,361 --> 01:02:08,579
Scott: But the rationalization has no basis in science or ergonomics or anything.

860
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:13,600
Rym: learning Dvorak is just gonna slow you down in QWERTY and make you generally incompatible with almost the entire world.

861
01:02:13,761 --> 01:02:16,260
Scott: And there are people who say that they can just switch back and forth.

862
01:02:16,742 --> 01:02:26,639
Scott: But they say I've seen people who have said they can switch back and forth sit at a QWERTY and go And mess up right and go oops just like I sit at a Dvorak and go oops.

863
01:02:26,941 --> 01:02:28,269
Rym: Well, if I sit at a Dvorak I go.

864
01:02:28,329 --> 01:02:29,516
Rym: what the fuck is this?

865
01:02:29,536 --> 01:02:30,140
Scott: That's right.

866
01:02:30,641 --> 01:02:34,652
Scott: So don't learn any other layout besides QWERTY.

867
01:02:35,233 --> 01:02:36,477
Scott: It's not worth it.

868
01:02:36,657 --> 01:02:37,660
Scott: It's just stupid.

869
01:02:38,001 --> 01:02:41,491
Rym: Maybe a zerty but only if that's you know, the style of your area.

870
01:02:41,511 --> 01:02:57,580
Scott: Yeah, you know learn your local keyboard and you know because I mean most people listening to this podcast know English because we're speaking in English and English is sort of becoming the language up to internets, you know, I mean most programming languages are in English.

871
01:02:57,881 --> 01:03:05,340
Scott: You know, it's just the sad reality that you know, the not so great language I mean, it's not the worst language, but there are better languages.

872
01:03:05,862 --> 01:03:09,860
Scott: But this is the one that won because the United States has the most money and the most guns.

873
01:03:10,081 --> 01:03:10,584
Rym: I am curious.

874
01:03:10,624 --> 01:03:12,535
Rym: What is a better language than English?

875
01:03:12,595 --> 01:03:23,709
Scott: Yeah Loge bond Loge bond Esperanto not Esperanto.

876
01:03:24,231 --> 01:03:29,237
