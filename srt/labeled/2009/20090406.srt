1
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,187
Rym: Hey, it's Monday April 6th.

2
00:00:11,447 --> 00:00:11,868
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:11,888 --> 00:00:14,115
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:14,155 --> 00:00:15,820
Rym: We have a bunch of different topics in tech.

5
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:26,917
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,932 --> 00:00:32,459
Rym: So this morning I went to a place.

7
00:00:32,519 --> 00:00:34,889
Rym: I very rarely enter these days.

8
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:38,785
Rym: I uh, I went into the Dunkin Donuts outside of my work.

9
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,253
Scott: Oh That one the place that's combined that right next to the TGI Fridays Yeah, the one that said.

10
00:00:44,274 --> 00:00:50,411
Scott: so that's like the tiniest and worst Dunkin Donuts the one that is also a KFC Space.

11
00:00:50,834 --> 00:00:53,190
Rym: I went in because you know, there's a big roll out of work.

12
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:58,910
Rym: So a bunch of people were showing up early from the sales team and the customer support team and I'm the morning guy anyway.

13
00:00:59,131 --> 00:01:00,960
Rym: So I wasn't actually gonna show up early.

14
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,166
Rym: I told all them.

15
00:01:02,206 --> 00:01:05,528
Rym: Yeah, I'll be here early I'll help you out, but I'm always there that early they could they don't know.

16
00:01:06,273 --> 00:01:08,769
Rym: So I even said you know what and I'll bring in some doughnuts.

17
00:01:09,131 --> 00:01:13,646
Rym: So I went in and usually I stop it like Starbucks, but instead well Starbucks can't give you done.

18
00:01:13,686 --> 00:01:23,840
Rym: It's in quantity like So normally I go to Starbucks and get coffee But instead I went to Dunkin Donuts just to get like a bunch of Timbits, you know There's gonna be like a million people in that Dunkin Donuts.

19
00:01:23,961 --> 00:01:25,367
Rym: It's it's 7 in the morning.

20
00:01:25,387 --> 00:01:27,074
Rym: Well like 645 There's no one there.

21
00:01:27,134 --> 00:01:27,355
Rym: There was.

22
00:01:27,455 --> 00:01:30,487
Rym: there were like two people in front of me in line and one guy walked in after.

23
00:01:30,508 --> 00:01:39,990
Rym: so Normally when I stand in line at the Starbucks I mean What's the stereotype of a Starbucks coffee buyer versus like a Dunkin Donuts or McDonald's coffee buyer?

24
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:49,130
Rym: The Starbucks guys the one who walks in they're like, yeah I want a double soy light latte with that extra this and not enough this and all this sort.

25
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,803
Rym: They have these really weird donuts.

26
00:01:50,823 --> 00:01:51,710
Scott: you get coffee.

27
00:01:52,691 --> 00:01:54,457
Rym: It's actually the exact opposite.

28
00:01:54,999 --> 00:01:56,123
Rym: every time I go to Starbucks.

29
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:57,488
Rym: It's just one after another.

30
00:01:57,508 --> 00:01:57,990
Rym: people walk up.

31
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:00,859
Rym: They're like tall black coffee or latte.

32
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:03,166
Rym: like they order very simple quick specific things.

33
00:02:03,387 --> 00:02:04,310
Rym: They're prepared immediately.

34
00:02:04,571 --> 00:02:06,659
Rym: They're not fussy if they get the wrong thing.

35
00:02:06,679 --> 00:02:08,969
Rym: They're usually like whatever and they just kind of deal with it.

36
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:17,110
Rym: Meanwhile at the Dunkin Donuts press a where it's like an order of magnitude cheaper like the coffee cost nothing.

37
00:02:17,592 --> 00:02:26,850
Rym: Mm-hmm, every single person in that line was giving these outrageous orders like hey Could you only fill the cup three quarters the way full and then fill the rest with like half-and-half?

38
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:29,081
Rym: But then at the top put a little bit of vanilla from that thing.

39
00:02:29,101 --> 00:02:30,971
Rym: you got over there and then stir it with one ice Cube.

40
00:02:31,212 --> 00:02:34,650
Scott: maybe they were like Starbucks II people but they were at the Dunkin Donuts.

41
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:39,210
Rym: No, no because the the guy says, you know the usual.

42
00:02:41,153 --> 00:02:43,730
Rym: And the next guy left and the clerks talked to him.

43
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:45,779
Rym: They go to that Dunkin Donuts every day.

44
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:54,849
Rym: And as I stood there waiting for my donuts apparently Shoveling donuts from the donut dispenser into my bin took longer than getting like 10 people coffee.

45
00:02:55,852 --> 00:02:59,603
Rym: Every single person in this Dunkin Donuts ordered like this like everyone had this.

46
00:02:59,623 --> 00:03:02,973
Rym: I would use the word outrageous order Like the.

47
00:03:03,094 --> 00:03:10,178
Rym: the level of fussiness and the level of expectation for their 98 cent coffee There should really just be like.

48
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,821
Scott: you should go in the restaurant and be like, you know We don't do anything.

49
00:03:13,862 --> 00:03:14,730
Scott: that isn't on the menu.

50
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,923
Scott: So if you want coffee say coffee you have no, you know, you mean like.

51
00:03:18,184 --> 00:03:21,359
Scott: you can tell me, you know Dark or not so dark.

52
00:03:21,399 --> 00:03:26,929
Scott: You can tell me yes milk or no milk You can tell me right but you can't tell me how much you can't tell me.

53
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:30,450
Scott: You know if you want it you do it yourself, you know, fuck we don't do that.

54
00:03:31,072 --> 00:03:41,385
Rym: What amazed me was that the stereotype was kind of reversed that the P the people getting the crappy coffee were the most Demanding and the people getting the more expensive coffee were generally less caring.

55
00:03:41,506 --> 00:03:42,770
Scott: It's all anecdotal anyway.

56
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,370
Scott: Well, the problem is it is something that could be studied.

57
00:03:45,651 --> 00:03:54,307
Rym: It's a weird situation because it is the Dunkin Donuts on 42nd Street But at the same time there are eight Starbucks within a two-minute walk of that place.

58
00:03:54,447 --> 00:03:59,310
Scott: Yeah The thing is, you know, they could be people trying to save money but are also fussy.

59
00:04:00,052 --> 00:04:04,886
Rym: Yeah, yeah, but I I have this general feeling I'm going solely on nothing here.

60
00:04:05,187 --> 00:04:06,230
Rym: I'm pulling this out of nowhere.

61
00:04:06,952 --> 00:04:18,305
Rym: I feel like if you did study this the less on average the less people pay For things the more not necessarily expectations, but the more demands they may make.

62
00:04:18,446 --> 00:04:19,750
Rym: and I'll bet it's a cultural thing.

63
00:04:20,151 --> 00:04:20,512
Scott: I don't know.

64
00:04:21,014 --> 00:04:21,454
Scott: You got a.

65
00:04:21,635 --> 00:04:25,186
Rym: I'm basing this entirely on my experiences at this Dunkin Donuts.

66
00:04:25,226 --> 00:04:26,470
Scott: Yeah, this one is one morning.

67
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:27,938
Scott: Why don't you go to Dunkin Donuts next to us?

68
00:04:27,978 --> 00:04:30,030
Scott: That's actually nice for a Dunkin Donuts.

69
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:33,585
Rym: Actually, the same thing happens at that Dunkin Donuts if you ever go into it.

70
00:04:33,826 --> 00:04:34,650
Scott: I never went into it.

71
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:35,453
Scott: Well often that much.

72
00:04:35,534 --> 00:04:39,719
Rym: I'll often stop there when I go for a run and grab like a doughnut just to get some sugar before I go.

73
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,795
Rym: hmm Anyway, that was my morning.

74
00:04:43,836 --> 00:04:44,919
Rym: That's that's what I got.

75
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:46,042
Scott: Oh, it's so exciting.

76
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:46,965
Scott: Yeah, it's thrilling.

77
00:04:47,627 --> 00:04:52,625
Scott: Oh Hi, do you have any I guess technology news of some sort?

78
00:04:52,806 --> 00:04:53,930
Rym: Oh, I gotta go into news a bit.

79
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:59,666
Rym: Well, I've realized more and more that in terms of commuting New Yorkers really have it better than everyone else.

80
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:05,970
Rym: our our commuter Infrastructure is amazing compared to pretty much everywhere else in America, America.

81
00:05:07,091 --> 00:05:08,319
Rym: That's an important qualification.

82
00:05:08,359 --> 00:05:09,245
Rym: forget the rest of the world.

83
00:05:09,285 --> 00:05:12,884
Rym: We got nothing on that Of course, uh, I think we beat those Indian trains.

84
00:05:13,266 --> 00:05:17,827
Rym: No, yeah What was that video where the people are jumping onto the moving train just to get a seat?

85
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:22,790
Rym: Yep But I didn't realize, you know, I've never been to Boston.

86
00:05:23,132 --> 00:05:26,710
Rym: I'm gonna go to Boston for the first time for anime Boston and then again for PAX East.

87
00:05:26,851 --> 00:05:29,270
Scott: But I've been to Boston so many times just not in a while.

88
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,419
Rym: But yeah, well, I mean what I grew up in the Midwest.

89
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:40,010
Rym: my vacations were like down to Florida or to see your point of Florida also or to Chicago, but I think we didn't go out east to those eastern places the good places.

90
00:05:41,253 --> 00:05:42,522
Rym: Is really that good in Boston.

91
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:43,530
Scott: Boston's pretty nice.

92
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:44,754
Scott: It's also.

93
00:05:44,774 --> 00:05:48,949
Scott: it's also real colonial except like you think it's colonial like around here.

94
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:50,998
Scott: You go to Boston.

95
00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:53,530
Rym: Yeah, but you know, it's not so nice in Boston the MTBA.

96
00:05:54,112 --> 00:06:09,250
Rym: I'm gonna read an excerpt from the beginning of this article because it's kind of interesting and I Think this illustrates more than anything Why commuter rail or generally a lot of publicly funded things have issues quote?

97
00:06:10,172 --> 00:06:11,255
Rym: It's been documented before.

98
00:06:11,315 --> 00:06:17,175
Rym: the commuter rail service in Massachusetts is among the tardiest in the country with trains showing up late more than 20% of the time.

99
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:24,465
Rym: hmm, but the official NT MTBA numbers tell only part of the sad commuting story.

100
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:32,005
Rym: according to a globe analysis the rush-hour trains the ones most people take are actually late 6% more often.

101
00:06:32,105 --> 00:06:37,902
Scott: that are indicated by the official statistics Because the other the non rush-hour trains show up on time enough.

102
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:40,190
Scott: well, so they only look at the total numbers.

103
00:06:41,014 --> 00:06:41,618
Rym: That's the thing.

104
00:06:42,141 --> 00:06:43,790
Scott: They should do it by person.

105
00:06:44,851 --> 00:06:46,315
Scott: People get on a late train.

106
00:06:46,355 --> 00:06:47,498
Scott: That's how you figure it out,

107
00:06:47,799 --> 00:07:01,947
Rym: but it turns out that they very pointedly and specifically aggregate the numbers from the entire day for their statistics and in fact They make a point of not tracking commuter versus non commuter so that no one can use those statistics to do anything.

108
00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:14,337
Rym: Mm-hmm They obfuscate the data and I think what bothers me the most if there's a quote an official quote from the one of the guys like the head of all this and the MTBA and he says From a service perspective.

109
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:22,797
Rym: I don't want to be saying that one train is more important than another Which either Belies his intelligence or

110
00:07:23,058 --> 00:07:23,861
Scott: I think that yeah

111
00:07:24,684 --> 00:07:33,875
Rym: or or more more likely It proves that he realizes that numbers would make him and his department look bad and thus covers them up The most expedient way possible.

112
00:07:34,217 --> 00:07:37,610
Scott: Well, what they should do is really I mean Metro North does the same thing, right?

113
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:42,730
Scott: They just give you the total lateness numbers They don't give you the you know times really do the same time.

114
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:43,816
Rym: But one thing I can point.

115
00:07:44,098 --> 00:07:46,211
Scott: I think they might actually split peak and off peak I don't.

116
00:07:46,331 --> 00:07:51,894
Rym: one thing I can point out about Metro North is that in all my years of commuting on it It's mostly on time.

117
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:54,524
Rym: The rush hour trains are pretty much never late.

118
00:07:54,564 --> 00:07:57,064
Rym: And if anything is late, it's the off-peak trains No one cares about.

119
00:07:57,084 --> 00:08:01,964
Scott: yeah What they should do is they shouldn't say how many trains are late.

120
00:08:02,144 --> 00:08:07,397
Scott: they should say how many passengers Arrived at their destination late.

121
00:08:07,717 --> 00:08:12,050
Scott: Well, that's what they should calculate is what percentage of passengers or when you know what they could do.

122
00:08:12,131 --> 00:08:13,443
Scott: Here's the most accurate number.

123
00:08:13,484 --> 00:08:16,729
Scott: you could use Total passenger late minutes.

124
00:08:17,292 --> 00:08:24,476
Scott: So if I miss if I'm late for my stop for five minutes and there are a hundred people on that train that adds 500 late minutes.

125
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,184
Scott: you see and that's how they should figure it out.

126
00:08:26,224 --> 00:08:27,350
Scott: Just total late minutes.

127
00:08:27,734 --> 00:08:29,149
Rym: But no, here's the more important point.

128
00:08:30,531 --> 00:08:31,133
Rym: Think about this.

129
00:08:31,434 --> 00:08:35,485
Rym: How come the trains that are used the most are so much more late.

130
00:08:35,505 --> 00:08:41,230
Rym: There's clearly yeah, either These schedules are bad and because the train has to stop at the station longer.

131
00:08:42,352 --> 00:08:43,736
Rym: No, that's not the problem.

132
00:08:43,777 --> 00:08:45,201
Rym: That's that doesn't even factor into this.

133
00:08:46,204 --> 00:08:50,456
Rym: if the rush hour trains are consistently that late What jackass is making?

134
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:54,107
Rym: the schedules say that they'll make it at these times that they clearly can't make?

135
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:55,150
Scott: that's also true.

136
00:08:55,471 --> 00:09:03,453
Rym: That is the fundamental problem that they're holding themselves to a standard that they clearly can't make and then they're making that standard by lying Mm-hmm.

137
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:06,364
Rym: Now the other thing is they really it's.

138
00:09:06,465 --> 00:09:12,048
Rym: it seems like they haven't actually investigated what the specific causes are because it it does break down pretty simply either.

139
00:09:12,108 --> 00:09:15,270
Rym: it's People getting out and getting off because you see this Metro North trains.

140
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:22,049
Rym: it takes like five sometimes six or seven minutes for the beacon train to fill out just because Everyone's stupid and they all get into the front car.

141
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:24,577
Scott: Yeah, it takes them all this time.

142
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:27,589
Scott: just get off the train you're just sitting there and well people get off.

143
00:09:28,031 --> 00:09:31,907
Rym: Yeah, but also maybe there's something to do with you know cascade effects.

144
00:09:32,007 --> 00:09:36,310
Rym: one train is late And then all the other trains don't have any leeway that there could be a million things.

145
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:43,470
Rym: But it seems like very trivially if they just track to this data instead of trying to lie about it or cover it up.

146
00:09:43,611 --> 00:09:45,128
Scott: But that require doing actual work.

147
00:09:45,832 --> 00:09:55,290
Rym: but they're already tracking the trains but then they aggregate the data and get rid of the Specific data, all they would have to do is add that data is like, you know, not even like correctly.

148
00:09:56,314 --> 00:09:57,068
Rym: What's even worse?

149
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:07,344
Rym: apparently their policy the way it works internally is that they find the train operator if his train is late and it wasn't due to something he had control or it was due to something he had control over.

150
00:10:07,364 --> 00:10:11,482
Rym: but When would a train operator ever make a train late?

151
00:10:11,582 --> 00:10:13,410
Rym: on purpose or within their control?

152
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:21,919
Scott: I guess you could mess up right like you could you know mess up going through the signals or you know Something sudden along those lines, you know, you could.

153
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,565
Scott: you know, not you could like, you know not mess up something I don't know.

154
00:10:25,831 --> 00:10:25,891
Scott: It

155
00:10:25,971 --> 00:10:40,649
Rym: seems like that is not the best way to go about fixing this Because one that only encourages people to lie or cover up when they've made a mistake or say if they're late due to an error Maybe they'll speed to catch up and turn off the safeties because they don't want to get.

156
00:10:40,669 --> 00:10:40,990
Rym: fine.

157
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,078
Scott: It's also that's a tear.

158
00:10:42,098 --> 00:10:43,769
Rym: I mean there was even a TED talk about that.

159
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:48,246
Rym: That's the exact wrong way to incentivize people to do their job better.

160
00:10:48,407 --> 00:11:01,466
Rym: Yeah, that's right but it's such a simple solution, but I don't think there's any way to force a Proper because anyone who's smart enough to manage the trains right is this remember?

161
00:11:01,486 --> 00:11:02,630
Scott: This is like a government job.

162
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:08,130
Scott: This is like a job that's all union e and seniority, right and not meritocracy.

163
00:11:08,551 --> 00:11:17,303
Scott: Someone who's smart enough to manage the trains is never gonna have that job and that job will never pay enough or be pleasant enough For someone who is that smart to ever want that job.

164
00:11:17,946 --> 00:11:18,649
Scott: So there you go.

165
00:11:19,232 --> 00:11:19,895
Rym: The best part is.

166
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:26,827
Rym: apparently they just had a big rate hike and a lot of that money went into Putting in new turnstiles and stuff that don't work as opposed to fixing the trains.

167
00:11:27,128 --> 00:11:27,490
Scott: Oh, really?

168
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,217
Rym: Yeah, at least the MTA.

169
00:11:29,257 --> 00:11:31,770
Rym: every time they get a bunch of money suddenly everything gets a lot nicer.

170
00:11:32,352 --> 00:11:36,850
Scott: I mean, you know, there's a problem with doing a meritocracy as your government.

171
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:49,590
Scott: We haven't figured that one out yet, but there is no problem doing a meritocracy And a place of employment because we have very real rubrics and metrics for measuring someone's job performance and a lot of these.

172
00:11:51,192 --> 00:11:56,090
Rym: Interestingly enough because I'm Randomly, I've been reading a lot about the napoleonic error again.

173
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:59,847
Rym: I got all these books from when I was gonna run this burning wheel game that I never got around to.

174
00:11:59,908 --> 00:12:01,093
Rym: it's so far Down in the hopper.

175
00:12:01,274 --> 00:12:02,419
Scott: She's talking so much.

176
00:12:02,841 --> 00:12:03,504
Rym: It's in the hopper.

177
00:12:03,846 --> 00:12:05,934
Scott: Uh-huh Yeah, it's a deep hopper.

178
00:12:06,195 --> 00:12:41,550
Rym: My hopper is deeper than you can possibly imagine, but I was reading this stuff again and I Lot of historians have made the very interesting point that two Surprising meritocracies that did exist and did work functionally and properly to a large degree where the British Navy during that whole era and the military of France during the early part of the napoleonic era Mm-hmm, and there was a. there's a whole chapter in one of these books on why these like why these were meritocracies And why they worked and then at the same time why eventually they broke down and we're no longer meritocracies.

179
00:12:42,792 --> 00:12:45,569
Rym: But I feel like we can apply a lot of those policies to things we have now.

180
00:12:45,751 --> 00:12:48,706
Scott: Well, we got to watch out for that why they broke down part.

181
00:12:48,826 --> 00:12:49,148
Rym: Yes.

182
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:53,189
Rym: Yes Yes, we also have to watch out for captain laudanum who invariably makes his way in.

183
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,514
Scott: Yeah, it's a problem.

184
00:12:55,895 --> 00:13:04,718
Scott: Well, I think most remember those are both militaries which has sort of like the the sort of side Factor of people without merit.

185
00:13:04,758 --> 00:13:05,982
Scott: just there's lots of death.

186
00:13:06,544 --> 00:13:08,370
Scott: So you just lose lots of people that way.

187
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:17,129
Rym: Yeah, well like if you're a bad ship captain either you're gonna get course mark cart marshal and hung or hanged I guess is the technical term or your ship's gonna get stumped.

188
00:13:18,452 --> 00:13:21,270
Scott: Yeah, it says, you know, but that doesn't really happen so much.

189
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:30,870
Scott: I mean unless you're a really really really really bad train operator Your trains not gonna crash like the guy who crashed the train because he was busy playing with teenagers and text messaging everyone.

190
00:13:31,071 --> 00:13:32,398
Scott: Yeah, that's that's super rare.

191
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:38,425
Rym: So here's where this gets really interesting our Chan Fung and I think that's one of the coolest names.

192
00:13:38,466 --> 00:13:40,071
Rym: I've ever seen a Quote.

193
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:54,158
Rym: political scientist who is part of Harvard's transparency policy project Argues that the T and other public organizations should make all of their data available to the public over the internet in raw form Of course, so customers can quote him.

194
00:13:54,479 --> 00:13:55,663
Rym: Well, I guess I'm quoting again.

195
00:13:55,683 --> 00:13:56,446
Rym: There's a meta quote here.

196
00:13:56,928 --> 00:13:57,449
Rym: mash it up.

197
00:13:57,911 --> 00:14:09,341
Rym: He thinks that in general if you just take like if instead of aggregating the data and publishing this specific data that you know Like these are our times or whatever What if they just made an API and just put out

198
00:14:10,063 --> 00:14:12,170
Scott: all they're not smart enough to fix a train schedule.

199
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:15,562
Scott: You think they're smart enough to make like a cool web API.

200
00:14:15,702 --> 00:14:16,184
Rym: Here's the thing.

201
00:14:16,224 --> 00:14:17,268
Rym: even know what that is.

202
00:14:17,308 --> 00:14:18,820
Rym: Here's the thing I'm pretty sure.

203
00:14:18,961 --> 00:14:28,610
Rym: if they said sure That Harvard could put together a team of IT people and CS people to make it So in like a couple weeks, yeah, they could do it.

204
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:31,330
Scott: But the thing is they'd need to basically get full access.

205
00:14:31,451 --> 00:14:33,260
Scott: Otherwise, they wouldn't be able to be.

206
00:14:33,341 --> 00:14:40,233
Scott: it'd be that situation where you're sitting there Just waiting for the stupid person to give you what you're asking for and then they give it to you and it's not what you Asked for.

207
00:14:40,253 --> 00:14:43,470
Scott: yeah, but and you're sitting there waiting for this email and you're not doing anything.

208
00:14:43,731 --> 00:14:51,890
Rym: I think it could be done pretty readily if only Politicians could force the MTBA to open up their data.

209
00:14:52,573 --> 00:14:56,189
Rym: Yeah, it would take a law and be and they had a bunch of grad students.

210
00:14:57,252 --> 00:14:58,419
Scott: It would take a lie.

211
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,828
Scott: There's so much stupidity in the way.

212
00:15:00,732 --> 00:15:04,347
Rym: All it would take is one law and like ten grad student.

213
00:15:04,387 --> 00:15:05,110
Scott: Oh, yeah, it's a lot.

214
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:06,510
Scott: You know a law is a lot to ask.

215
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:11,770
Scott: I know I know I know and then you actually think that people are gonna execute the law like properly.

216
00:15:12,432 --> 00:15:25,350
Rym: But I do like the idea, you know politics aside that any public organization unless the data they have is Politically like is sensitive in a way that could cause direct harm to people should just be completely open to.

217
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:34,930
Rym: Even if they can't make a web API I Should be able to mail them and pay some nominal pittance and just get it all in text format on like a CD.

218
00:15:35,131 --> 00:15:38,144
Scott: That's what the FOI is supposed to be for except half the time.

219
00:15:38,184 --> 00:15:38,826
Rym: It's all secret.

220
00:15:38,887 --> 00:15:41,898
Scott: Anyway, yeah It's you know, and they're trying to work on it.

221
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:45,490
Scott: I think but that it's really the results so far have been unimpressive.

222
00:15:45,992 --> 00:15:50,407
Rym: Of course the thing is scarily, you know, who's some of the biggest pushers of the FOI?

223
00:15:50,467 --> 00:15:57,048
Rym: a stuff are UFO people of course and then they always claim it's not working because the government's like fine.

224
00:15:57,108 --> 00:15:57,650
Rym: Here's the data.

225
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:03,508
Scott: We didn't find any stupid UFO like, you know, FYA when I was in high school or whatever to get whatever.

226
00:16:03,528 --> 00:16:04,030
Scott: they sent me.

227
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:10,819
Scott: Yeah, and I read it all and it was basically a whole bunch of nothing and there was some stuff blacked out But it was barely anything.

228
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:13,674
Scott: and like, okay There was some stuff blacked out.

229
00:16:13,714 --> 00:16:26,578
Scott: right if I if I anything that could possibly have fit where those words were Would not have met their aliens actually remember that there was nothing you could have written That would have made sense in those black spaces.

230
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,750
Scott: that would have you know blown the lid off the roof.

231
00:16:29,851 --> 00:16:32,770
Scott: It was probably most of the stuff was probably like people's names.

232
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:34,675
Rym: Remember way back.

233
00:16:34,775 --> 00:16:47,427
Rym: not not the thing where you could just turn off the redactions in Adobe documents But that guy who made the statistical analysis program where you could figure out with a reasonable degree of certainty What was redacted just by the context of the sentences?

234
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:52,890
Scott: Yep And also, you know the stuff where it was printed but then gone over with a marker.

235
00:16:53,251 --> 00:16:55,059
Scott: They would use a scanner to see it again.

236
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,224
Rym: Yeah, it's pretty trivial.

237
00:16:56,284 --> 00:16:57,349
Rym: Actually we could do that at home.

238
00:16:57,751 --> 00:17:02,230
Scott: Yep, you can actually do it just like a shiny light and your eyeballs sometimes anyway.

239
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:10,660
Rym: I think I think this is an interesting article because it raises a lot of issues that are interesting And it proposes all the solutions we need.

240
00:17:11,301 --> 00:17:19,589
Rym: but it's one of those things where we know the problem We know the solution we have the means to put forth the solution, but it will never happen.

241
00:17:20,452 --> 00:17:26,470
Rym: And I I don't know what to do about the same problem as everything else.

242
00:17:26,651 --> 00:17:29,022
Rym: But but again, I don't know what to do about it.

243
00:17:29,263 --> 00:17:32,133
Scott: You got to kill all the stupid people You could do.

244
00:17:32,334 --> 00:17:33,658
Rym: I don't think that's a solution either.

245
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:39,140
Scott: Well, you know get rid not killed literally, you know, just get you know It's it's the battle against stupidity.

246
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,788
Scott: It is never-ending and give up.

247
00:17:42,651 --> 00:17:47,689
Scott: So this is a this is sort of a sad story, but it sort of got my mind on a tangent, right?

248
00:17:48,510 --> 00:18:00,050
Scott: You know when you install adblock plus it asks you to choose to subscribe to a filter Yeah, and there's different filters for different countries, you know and such and you always pick the the easy list, right?

249
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:00,700
Scott: Cuz it's the u.s.

250
00:18:00,842 --> 00:18:02,190
Scott: One right.

251
00:18:03,151 --> 00:18:04,595
Rym: Yes, yeah, yeah, I do.

252
00:18:04,615 --> 00:18:11,157
Scott: I have to keep backing you yeah, so the the guy who maintained the easy list He died.

253
00:18:11,177 --> 00:18:17,547
Scott: Oh Yeah, well, so, you know, that's that's sad that this guy died.

254
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:22,526
Scott: and You know some people were saying oh no is the easy list still gonna be around.

255
00:18:22,607 --> 00:18:22,848
Scott: Oh, no.

256
00:18:22,888 --> 00:18:23,008
Scott: Yeah.

257
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:24,321
Scott: Well, yeah It's gonna be fine.

258
00:18:24,361 --> 00:18:29,370
Scott: Don't don't worry You know worry more about the guy dying than worrying about the ad block continuing to work, right?

259
00:18:29,671 --> 00:18:30,654
Rym: That's all people worry about.

260
00:18:30,675 --> 00:18:31,538
Rym: right riser.

261
00:18:31,638 --> 00:18:33,284
Rym: What did anyone talk about on slashdot?

262
00:18:33,585 --> 00:18:35,150
Rym: So what's happening to the file system, right?

263
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:35,551
Scott: All right.

264
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:44,209
Scott: So the thing is that that I thought was interesting as I started thinking Hey, you know even adblock plus the greatest ad block system in the world, right?

265
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,130
Scott: Basically has a human maintainer.

266
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:52,409
Scott: There's a guy who goes out there and finds ads and then comes up with the regular expressions that block them.

267
00:18:53,352 --> 00:18:55,589
Scott: It's it's not automatic, you know.

268
00:18:56,411 --> 00:18:59,143
Scott: Look like blocking ads like a DVR here.

269
00:18:59,284 --> 00:19:02,841
Scott: I mean sure sometimes It can sort of like oh, aha.

270
00:19:02,881 --> 00:19:04,150
Scott: There was a fade-out and a fade-in.

271
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:08,829
Scott: I'll skip that but sometimes there's a show with a fade-out or in a faded or a movie or something in it.

272
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:17,530
Scott: You know, it's an or it's not precise and you need a person to actually fast forward and you know Or cut the ad out in some video editor to put it on bit toward her.

273
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:20,362
Rym: Well South Park did it pretty well where they did by accident.

274
00:19:20,402 --> 00:19:22,370
Rym: Yeah, we forgot to put the ads into that episode.

275
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,134
Scott: Yeah, that was pretty good.

276
00:19:24,415 --> 00:19:30,270
Rym: so literally we're watching South Park commercial break comes and there's just a minute and 30 seconds of a blank screen.

277
00:19:30,953 --> 00:19:32,842
Rym: Yep, it was actually kind of pleasant.

278
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:34,370
Rym: It was a nice intermission.

279
00:19:34,672 --> 00:19:35,437
Scott: I kind of like that.

280
00:19:35,477 --> 00:19:37,450
Scott: tell you they gotta bring intermission back to the movie theaters.

281
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:44,530
Scott: But anyway, I just you know, it got me started thinking about like how all these adblock systems are still human systems.

282
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:48,109
Scott: It's and there is no automatic ad blocking really so much.

283
00:19:48,792 --> 00:19:48,932
Scott: It's.

284
00:19:49,073 --> 00:19:52,985
Scott: it's always people, you know deciding what are ads and what are not ads.

285
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,309
Scott: and this really, you know.

286
00:19:54,490 --> 00:20:06,290
Scott: And it's it's sort of a subjective thing there and it's also sort of there's no no There's no way it could possibly be done, you know Like what could you possibly do to have a computer at the same time?

287
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:15,610
Rym: This is almost the same issue as the MBTA thing where by we have we have People's brains who are very smart and able to do crazy things.

288
00:20:15,771 --> 00:20:17,969
Rym: Computers are nowhere near and won't be for a long time.

289
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:30,830
Rym: crowdsourcing can solve amazing problems in amazing amounts of time But at the same time very few people who like the people who need this the most don't leverage it.

290
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:39,241
Rym: so we only get it for things like ad blocking and things where geeks are the ones who care about the problem and Geeks are the ones who can implement the solution.

291
00:20:39,582 --> 00:20:39,763
Rym: Mm-hmm.

292
00:20:39,944 --> 00:20:41,090
Rym: We never get it for anything else.

293
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:41,913
Scott: That's why we're just.

294
00:20:42,234 --> 00:20:55,377
Scott: that's why it's gotten to the point where the geek world is just another world from you know because all the things that geeks care about and geeks have control over are basically in the future and everything else is Really no different than it used to be.

295
00:20:55,417 --> 00:20:59,310
Scott: because you know, there hasn't been you know, any sort of geek action there.

296
00:20:59,711 --> 00:21:09,069
Rym: I mean look normal people Hulu is like this cool thing that they use on their computer to watch some TV with ads But they still watch cable geeks computer hooked up to the TV and a hacked boxy.

297
00:21:09,109 --> 00:21:10,937
Rym: Yep They don't like they don't even think about it.

298
00:21:11,117 --> 00:21:13,628
Rym: Nope, but yet normal people have no access to that.

299
00:21:14,069 --> 00:21:17,036
Rym: Nope So what do we do about this?

300
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:21,450
Rym: Do we just continue to break away further and further from the society around us?

301
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:22,895
Scott: Oh, what are you gonna go and give up?

302
00:21:22,915 --> 00:21:24,421
Scott: Why are you geekiness and live slowly?

303
00:21:24,441 --> 00:21:29,290
Rym: I can be like that Neo primitivist that Emily knew in college.

304
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,621
Scott: Yeah, you're gonna be like that the guy who get.

305
00:21:31,661 --> 00:21:36,417
Rym: he got rid of all his furniture in his dorm room Clothes and he kept his Mac book.

306
00:21:36,737 --> 00:21:39,905
Rym: Yeah, cuz he had to blog about his a neo-primitivist lifestyle.

307
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:40,566
Scott: I know right?

308
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:42,291
Rym: I Don't know.

309
00:21:42,331 --> 00:21:47,190
Rym: Well, I wonder if maybe I feel like some speculation is due as to what?

310
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:52,495
Rym: Problems this schism is going to cause ten years from now Ten years from now.

311
00:21:52,515 --> 00:21:55,003
Scott: I mean the same problems you have now only worse.

312
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:58,598
Scott: cuz what's gonna happen is, you know You're already seeing it now.

313
00:21:58,879 --> 00:22:01,410
Scott: It's the situation of oh, no, the newspapers are going to add business.

314
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:08,010
Scott: What's the normal person gonna do who doesn't know how to use a computer and it's like, you know, you had your transition period.

315
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:10,258
Scott: It's been over a decade since the Internet's.

316
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,490
Scott: you've had a long time to get you know to move ahead.

317
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:17,289
Scott: If you still haven't moved ahead, there's not a newspaper anymore.

318
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:18,694
Scott: You have no choice.

319
00:22:19,035 --> 00:22:21,924
Scott: if you don't like ebooks, you know or computer.

320
00:22:21,964 --> 00:22:23,890
Rym: I think it's going to be reading on a screen.

321
00:22:24,091 --> 00:22:31,870
Rym: I think it's going to be far more sinister than that because as long as there are people who can't use these technologies There will be a market in catering to them.

322
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:35,025
Rym: But at the same time these are the people who will just buy.

323
00:22:35,065 --> 00:22:40,498
Rym: the nature of the media They consume and the way they consume it will have the least control over what they get.

324
00:22:40,858 --> 00:22:50,070
Rym: so they'll be more and more Scarily controlled by the very people who use the technology to give them their information in their old methods.

325
00:22:50,753 --> 00:22:53,870
Scott: Yeah, but their numbers will be so small that they won't be able to do anything.

326
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:56,340
Scott: It'll just be a very, you know, they'll be the crazies.

327
00:22:56,681 --> 00:22:57,926
Rym: Will they really though?

328
00:22:58,026 --> 00:22:58,990
Rym: How small will they be?

329
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:03,330
Rym: I mean, I don't know big at first and then decreasing over time at the same time.

330
00:23:03,471 --> 00:23:06,790
Scott: I don't know if the person also mostly be old people who go away.

331
00:23:07,072 --> 00:23:08,301
Scott: You know the first ones to go.

332
00:23:08,462 --> 00:23:09,630
Rym: for every 4chan kid.

333
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:13,647
Rym: There are still 10 kids who don't really use the internet and still read newspapers either.

334
00:23:13,667 --> 00:23:14,210
Rym: They don't read.

335
00:23:14,691 --> 00:23:16,397
Scott: Yeah, but kids don't read.

336
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:16,819
Scott: we don't wear.

337
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:19,588
Scott: the old people don't worry about they read.

338
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:21,609
Rym: now I'm not I'm more worried about the kids.

339
00:23:22,312 --> 00:23:27,856
Scott: Well that kids not reading is a different problem than old people reading paper But I think it's getting.

340
00:23:27,876 --> 00:23:34,110
Rym: it's getting to the point more and more where I have very little ways to Communicate with the people around me like in my neighborhood.

341
00:23:34,633 --> 00:23:42,025
Rym: I would have almost no way to communicate with anyone in my neighborhood Like I if I found their first and last name, I'd have to go find a phone book, I guess.

342
00:23:42,567 --> 00:23:44,899
Scott: Yeah He's Google phone book.

343
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,730
Rym: Yeah, but that doesn't always work so well.

344
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:50,630
Scott: Maybe I could just shout into the street going to someone's door and knocking on it.

345
00:23:50,851 --> 00:23:51,857
Scott: It's like the olden days.

346
00:23:51,877 --> 00:23:52,883
Scott: he could do that nowadays.

347
00:23:52,923 --> 00:23:54,050
Scott: He can't do that so much.

348
00:23:54,311 --> 00:23:59,668
Rym: I guess you could but I have not knocked on a stranger's door in almost a decade.

349
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,943
Rym: Yeah I mean, you know, nope, nope one not that long ago.

350
00:24:03,043 --> 00:24:04,270
Rym: I knocked on the wrong door.

351
00:24:04,673 --> 00:24:26,088
Scott: People will think you're a Jehovah's Witness or something You know, you're only knock at a door if you have actual business, you know I'm a UPS guy or I'm I'm coming to fix your water heater or I'm your friend or you know You know a stranger knocking on the door to talk about something that a is not a business Transaction and B is not a sales pitch from a religious person.

352
00:24:26,108 --> 00:24:31,046
Rym: that Knocking on my door is the equivalent of pinging my secure ports.

353
00:24:31,066 --> 00:24:31,850
Rym: It's like what are you doing?

354
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,559
Rym: Why are you trying that that ports not for you?

355
00:24:33,841 --> 00:24:34,766
Scott: Yeah, it's so.

356
00:24:34,826 --> 00:24:37,455
Rym: it's like There's an API right?

357
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:38,660
Rym: There's that mailbox.

358
00:24:38,841 --> 00:24:41,150
Scott: I mean, maybe we could you know, I mean there's nothing wrong with it.

359
00:24:41,371 --> 00:24:43,240
Scott: But it just you know, it's not.

360
00:24:43,462 --> 00:24:46,478
Scott: it's not what it used to be This old gray mare.

361
00:24:46,498 --> 00:24:52,912
Rym: It's a you know, like remember that Hitchcock We were watching where those two guys just walk into the guy's house and hang out in his living room waiting for him to come Home.

362
00:24:53,195 --> 00:24:54,830
Scott: Yeah, that used to be totally cool.

363
00:24:55,213 --> 00:24:58,469
Scott: I'd like to live in a place where that was totally cool But that's not the way it is.

364
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:58,630
Scott: But

365
00:24:58,751 --> 00:25:17,912
Rym: I think the schism like even at my work like I work in an incredibly high-powered IT and CS environment Like I really honestly think I work in one of the most technologically proficient companies in America like I Don't want to brag but the like people are smart to the point that I often feel very dumb and very inadequate at the place I work.

366
00:25:18,575 --> 00:25:20,604
Rym: and for someone with my ego, I think that says something.

367
00:25:21,106 --> 00:25:24,222
Rym: and yet at the same time There was a conversation today at one of our big meetings.

368
00:25:24,805 --> 00:25:32,470
Rym: I am the only person Possibly in the company who uses Twitter at all and I barely use it because I'm a curmudgeon.

369
00:25:34,292 --> 00:25:35,136
Rym: Think about that.

370
00:25:35,297 --> 00:25:39,417
Scott: So you're not working at a very high-powered Technologically advanced place.

371
00:25:39,899 --> 00:25:40,742
Rym: I think I am though.

372
00:25:41,064 --> 00:25:42,389
Scott: No, but no one uses Twitter.

373
00:25:43,531 --> 00:25:48,376
Scott: Compare yourself to the company where everyone uses Twitter already that you go you got but at the same time What are they doing?

374
00:25:48,396 --> 00:25:49,850
Rym: What kind of big iron do they have running?

375
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:53,159
Scott: There are places that you all use Twitter and have big iron.

376
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,685
Scott: dig digs got big iron.

377
00:25:54,705 --> 00:25:56,090
Rym: Do you even know what big iron means?

378
00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:06,026
Rym: Yeah But anyway, I got.

379
00:26:06,066 --> 00:26:07,272
Rym: I got a good thing of the day here.

380
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:10,744
Rym: I found this out of nowhere Like it was oh shit.

381
00:26:10,785 --> 00:26:11,607
Scott: I forgot my thing today.

382
00:26:11,628 --> 00:26:12,109
Scott: What was that?

383
00:26:12,189 --> 00:26:24,719
Rym: But I'll talk about mine and maybe you'll remember yours, but Out of the blue we were talking about peeing because I think I had a. I had a particularly long Pee session the other day to the point that it woke Scott up in his room.

384
00:26:25,801 --> 00:26:27,068
Rym: So, you know, he comes to me the next day.

385
00:26:27,088 --> 00:26:27,611
Rym: He's like Rym.

386
00:26:27,631 --> 00:26:29,119
Rym: That was quite a pee ahead this morning.

387
00:26:29,701 --> 00:26:38,560
Rym: You shouldn't pee that loud and then my response as I often do I kind of respond in the real world The way I would respond to someone if I were on FARC.

388
00:26:39,102 --> 00:26:42,560
Rym: Is that just went to my computer went on YouTube and search for that scene?

389
00:26:42,942 --> 00:26:45,720
Rym: From a league of their own where Tom Hanks just pees forever.

390
00:26:47,321 --> 00:26:48,244
Rym: And I found it.

391
00:26:48,726 --> 00:26:54,804
Rym: but then there are all these other scenes and I realized that this video was a collection of All the times.

392
00:26:54,884 --> 00:26:59,680
Rym: Tom Hanks has had an extended peeing scene in a movie and you know what?

393
00:27:00,361 --> 00:27:04,063
Rym: there are a lot of them like a Surprising number.

394
00:27:04,103 --> 00:27:09,580
Rym: Tom Hanks is now typecast as the guy what pees on screen for longer than is comfortable.

395
00:27:09,984 --> 00:27:11,678
Rym: Yeah, I mean a league of their own.

396
00:27:12,766 --> 00:27:17,040
Rym: the Green Mile Apollo 13 the castaway movie.

397
00:27:17,823 --> 00:27:18,793
Rym: There were like four more.

398
00:27:18,894 --> 00:27:19,500
Rym: it was crazy.

399
00:27:20,265 --> 00:27:21,299
Scott: He does a lot of peeing.

400
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:27,167
Scott: I mean if I me if I'm making a movie which I'm probably never gonna do really but And I need someone to pee.

401
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:28,333
Scott: I know who to call.

402
00:27:28,353 --> 00:27:31,548
Rym: I Think a league of their own has the longest one.

403
00:27:31,688 --> 00:27:36,969
Scott: But yeah, so I forgot my thing of the day But I remembered an alternative thing of the day.

404
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,696
Scott: So I don't have to get up and pause the show.

405
00:27:38,836 --> 00:27:47,060
Scott: All right, so You know that there's a webcomic that's pretty old and actually hasn't been updated in a long time called Shabbat six thousand.

406
00:27:47,526 --> 00:27:51,065
Rym: Oh, I love Shabbat Shabot dot com.

407
00:27:51,125 --> 00:27:52,248
Scott: six thousand dot com.

408
00:27:52,509 --> 00:27:54,535
Rym: get a link to that flash of the one.

409
00:27:54,555 --> 00:27:55,960
Rym: I forget what holiday it is.

410
00:27:56,181 --> 00:27:57,314
Scott: Well, he's got a few flashes.

411
00:27:57,375 --> 00:28:17,280
Scott: But anyway Basically, it's a funny comic where you have a robot living with a rabbi and the robot learns about Jewishness And he's always being like, you know misbehaving You know, at least Jewish misbehaving, you know, it's like, you know on Yom Kippur, you know to help me get through the fast.

412
00:28:17,663 --> 00:28:19,719
Scott: You know, sometimes I eat a little.

413
00:28:22,431 --> 00:28:35,379
Scott: So That guy apparently a year ago made this video 20 things to do with matzah and that thing sort of became popular on the Internet's this year.

414
00:28:36,244 --> 00:28:38,600
Scott: Took a year, you know that to the next Passover.

415
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:45,476
Scott: so it's a fun video of this guy and a girl singing a song about 20 things to do with matzah.

416
00:28:45,536 --> 00:28:49,650
Scott: and Passover is a Wednesday, so it's relevant.

417
00:28:50,372 --> 00:28:59,391
Scott: There's another flash video where It's a. it's a the rabbi the robot and 50 cent are Rapping about the ten players.

418
00:28:59,733 --> 00:29:00,838
Scott: That's a good one, too.

419
00:29:02,082 --> 00:29:02,504
Rym: All right.

420
00:29:02,806 --> 00:29:03,188
Scott: All right.

421
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:04,976
Rym: So, uh, what were we doing?

422
00:29:04,997 --> 00:29:05,600
Rym: this show on?

423
00:29:06,441 --> 00:29:06,762
Scott: I don't know.

424
00:29:06,782 --> 00:29:10,035
Scott: a whole bunch of stuff got it all written down.

425
00:29:10,658 --> 00:29:14,993
Scott: some of it I mean basically what happened was is people started giving us ideas for the show

426
00:29:15,013 --> 00:29:15,073
Rym: and

427
00:29:15,514 --> 00:29:24,740
Scott: all of the ideas either a required preparation right and the problem with a preparation show is not that we have to do preparation because we have time to do some preparation.

428
00:29:25,121 --> 00:29:39,907
Scott: Reparation is that if we do a show about something we don't know about like and have an actual experience with then our preparation Consists of internet research and the show becomes read Wikipedia Or effectively read Wikipedia.

429
00:29:39,927 --> 00:29:42,256
Scott: in which case what's the point of us doing a show right?

430
00:29:42,657 --> 00:29:43,380
Scott: We're gonna do a show?

431
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:52,800
Scott: It's either it's because we have personal experience with something and we can provide Knowledge or insight that is not available on the Internet's already with your Google searches, right?

432
00:29:54,143 --> 00:30:00,797
Scott: So the other problem is sometimes we get a show topic But the show topic is so minimal that it would only be like five minutes of talking.

433
00:30:00,818 --> 00:30:04,100
Scott: and that's it You know, oh we talked about it and well, we're done.

434
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:10,383
Scott: There's nothing else to say about that topic so that we can't really use that for a show because we need like 20 minutes At least of talking.

435
00:30:11,225 --> 00:30:17,060
Scott: so we decided hey, what if we combine a bunch of those five-minute shows into a 20-minute show and?

436
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,905
Scott: That might work.

437
00:30:19,306 --> 00:30:20,993
Scott: So it's not a tech news roundup.

438
00:30:21,033 --> 00:30:22,599
Scott: It's like a tech show roundup.

439
00:30:25,421 --> 00:30:33,131
Rym: I'll kick it right off with a short one because I think I mentioned this a little bit earlier but we had our live stream and it went really well.

440
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:37,106
Rym: the audio for that will be up this Thursday because we're gonna try to Do a full week of shows this week.

441
00:30:37,167 --> 00:30:40,080
Rym: try because you know Scott's going out of town Wednesday stuff.

442
00:30:40,201 --> 00:30:43,940
Rym: But I'll probably put about Olivia a bunch of extra stuff up in the feed this week.

443
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:47,740
Rym: But you know we recorded this and we did it on you stream and things were going fine.

444
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:56,252
Rym: And then a little way through suddenly the shit cockery began Suddenly and like a lot more than I would have expected.

445
00:30:56,272 --> 00:31:06,939
Scott: Well, I think what it really started happening I mean you know there were some people who were sort of you know GeekNights fans or a little bit shit cocky You know, but they were you know sort of relevantly shit cocky.

446
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,431
Rym: But then we got featured on the front page.

447
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:19,181
Scott: yes if you get enough people in your channel You'll get to the front page of you stream And then random people who just come to you stream TV will click on you or just get thrown into your channel You know.

448
00:31:19,201 --> 00:31:23,679
Scott: so you get those people and those people the shit cockers.

449
00:31:23,779 --> 00:31:34,420
Rym: now I have to preface this because I mean we're both technological people Scott and I are both aware fully of the nature of the legion of like the hordes of the Internet.

450
00:31:34,501 --> 00:31:37,459
Scott: The John Gabriel's internet fuckwad theory is not news to us.

451
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,784
Scott: Yeah, we have been playing the.

452
00:31:38,804 --> 00:31:41,050
Scott: you know the FPS is on the Internet's.

453
00:31:41,291 --> 00:31:55,159
Rym: for since you know last century millennium I mean I remember when I would play quake one I would log on to a server and I would be killed by a man named fuck Jesus who is saying your mother Repeatedly in the chat faster than he was shooting me.

454
00:31:55,722 --> 00:32:04,453
Scott: And then would you know after he killed everyone on the map would go to your corpse and crouch many times Man good times and anyway draw a giant penis and that you know.

455
00:32:04,493 --> 00:32:05,637
Scott: who knows what else would happen.

456
00:32:05,938 --> 00:32:07,042
Rym: or like you know look I'd

457
00:32:07,062 --> 00:32:13,519
Scott: go into an AOL chat room and someone would put in an ASCII art of like naked something and Like fuck fuck motherfuck

458
00:32:13,944 --> 00:32:22,653
Rym: I mean or the idea that It's kind of like in a city if there's any space where you can write something on it and no one can stop you The word fuck appears yeah,

459
00:32:22,714 --> 00:32:23,379
Scott: and it's anonymous.

460
00:32:24,521 --> 00:32:28,231
Scott: Yes, I mean you know we know the theory anonymity plus.

461
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:30,537
Scott: you know audience equals shit.

462
00:32:30,557 --> 00:32:31,380
Scott: cuck right yep.

463
00:32:31,701 --> 00:32:33,668
Rym: But our YouTube comments, they're just.

464
00:32:33,688 --> 00:32:37,100
Rym: they're a place people can scribble so they scribble horrifying things.

465
00:32:37,663 --> 00:32:38,326
Rym: And I knew this.

466
00:32:38,446 --> 00:32:39,894
Rym: I knew this on an intellectual level.

467
00:32:39,994 --> 00:32:41,120
Rym: I knew it on a practical level.

468
00:32:41,561 --> 00:32:46,778
Rym: I used filters like slashdot and Farken places to where I don't interact with these things.

469
00:32:46,858 --> 00:32:47,560
Rym: It's just noise.

470
00:32:47,701 --> 00:32:50,540
Rym: It's no more than static to me like I don't even recognize it.

471
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,969
Scott: I mean sometimes you encounter it, but it doesn't.

472
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:54,194
Scott: you know it doesn't get it through.

473
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:57,369
Scott: cuz you know we know it's there We knows the problem, and we know how to deal with.

474
00:32:57,389 --> 00:32:59,280
Scott: we've dealt with it for a decade.

475
00:32:59,701 --> 00:33:04,575
Rym: I mean the internet is the Wild West and I carry a gun and I shoot anyone who looks at me cross-eyed.

476
00:33:04,715 --> 00:33:08,753
Rym: yep, but I Guess I didn't really know it.

477
00:33:08,934 --> 00:33:13,016
Rym: on a visceral level it's one of those things where you knew it, but at the same time you didn't really.

478
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:19,603
Scott: because Suddenly like like imagine if you just said you lived in a coastal town And you had a bat.

479
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:20,567
Scott: you weren't like New Orleans.

480
00:33:20,587 --> 00:33:27,619
Scott: you actually had a real levee that worked and you just after a century You forgot that there were floods and then the levee broke.

481
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:43,717
Rym: the rapidity with which the Not just the rapidity the rapidity and the numerousness of the people who came into this chat room Spouting the most vile garbage imaginable at the drop of a hat to like.

482
00:33:44,138 --> 00:33:49,036
Rym: there is no Explanation other than the fact that they went to ustream continuously.

483
00:33:49,076 --> 00:34:02,247
Rym: there was a sea of people Constantly hitting the front page of ustream being immediately directed into whatever was featured there no matter what it was With just everything ready to go Like they were it it.

484
00:34:02,969 --> 00:34:06,140
Rym: it gets to the point where it's a matter of premeditation.

485
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:13,460
Rym: It's not like someone just sees a message board and thinks hey, and they go in and type shit fuck fuck fuck fuck shit shit shit shit fuck.

486
00:34:15,382 --> 00:34:21,020
Rym: It was that these people are like going to these sites with the specific intent of doing this.

487
00:34:21,181 --> 00:34:23,094
Scott: Yeah, I don't know if it's intent right.

488
00:34:23,174 --> 00:34:23,980
Scott: I think what it is.

489
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:34,074
Scott: this is a box to type in and they got to type in something right and Basically the third their minds are just so shit cock that that's just.

490
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:35,739
Scott: that's just what just sort of comes out.

491
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,065
Scott: It's a completely unthinking.

492
00:34:37,106 --> 00:34:40,320
Scott: It's completely, but think it's as reflexive as a drunken guy going.

493
00:34:41,665 --> 00:34:42,860
Rym: But think of this as a chat room.

494
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,748
Scott: It's like I fuck fuck fuck get within negative.

495
00:34:45,869 --> 00:34:53,000
Rym: ten seconds of us being on the front page like 10/15 of these people just start appearing one by one spouting it off.

496
00:34:53,482 --> 00:35:02,634
Rym: That means that for no matter what as long as anything is on the front page of that There's a constant stream of people being directed into it saying these things.

497
00:35:02,875 --> 00:35:07,418
Rym: There's a constant stream of people constantly trying to get into places to shit cock.

498
00:35:07,459 --> 00:35:10,103
Rym: I I Wonder.

499
00:35:10,163 --> 00:35:11,867
Rym: I want to write like a treatise on this.

500
00:35:11,927 --> 00:35:16,980
Rym: I want to figure out really why we know what we don't really know why.

501
00:35:18,141 --> 00:35:21,051
Scott: Yeah, we don't know why in a psychology sense.

502
00:35:21,071 --> 00:35:23,620
Scott: There should be like an actual book about it.

503
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,100
Scott: I mean we know we have so far.

504
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,279
Scott: We have a webcomic that explains it really well.

505
00:35:27,661 --> 00:35:34,760
Scott: But we don't know the real brain working because I'll and societal workings that result in this and you'll admit to you feel that urge.

506
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:35,884
Rym: Everyone feels it.

507
00:35:35,944 --> 00:35:54,537
Rym: every now and then that little that little tinge is kind of like you're walking down the street and you see like Someone drops their wallet and you think for a second I could just grab it and you don't you don't you like you don't even consider grabbing it, but part of your brain says you could and Sorry already started weighing the odds of getting away with it, but you don't do it.

508
00:35:54,557 --> 00:36:01,872
Rym: You're a good person You don't even think about it, but on the internet with things like this, you know I don't really think about taking the wallet as much as I think about like.

509
00:36:02,213 --> 00:36:03,980
Scott: should I ignore it or should I give it back?

510
00:36:05,021 --> 00:36:05,625
Scott: I don't even think.

511
00:36:05,645 --> 00:36:06,309
Scott: should I take it?

512
00:36:06,429 --> 00:36:08,260
Scott: It's should I ignore it or should I give it back?

513
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:08,761
Rym: I don't think.

514
00:36:08,782 --> 00:36:09,284
Rym: should I take it?

515
00:36:09,324 --> 00:36:15,893
Rym: but there's definitely that that the part of the brain I think is always Calculating whether or not you can get away with things.

516
00:36:16,194 --> 00:36:21,335
Rym: but on the internet There's no moral ambiguity because you're not you're not.

517
00:36:21,415 --> 00:36:23,883
Rym: all you're doing is saying something You're not doing anything.

518
00:36:24,485 --> 00:36:29,880
Rym: and I'll admit when I was in that the anonymous your chat with a stranger and Scott was over my shoulder.

519
00:36:29,961 --> 00:36:32,620
Rym: We're in there and we're typing and I talked to the stranger.

520
00:36:33,041 --> 00:36:38,097
Rym: I type two lines and I immediately feel this slight urge to just type your mom.

521
00:36:38,117 --> 00:36:39,000
Scott: I don't have that.

522
00:36:39,101 --> 00:36:45,248
Scott: Oh, no, your mom is sort of just become a reflexive say So it wasn't it wasn't a shit cocking urge.

523
00:36:45,268 --> 00:36:46,071
Scott: I don't really have that.

524
00:36:46,151 --> 00:36:49,366
Rym: but is if your mom is still a lesser degree of Shit cocking.

525
00:36:49,568 --> 00:36:52,203
Rym: I don't know Talking to a stranger.

526
00:36:52,223 --> 00:36:53,948
Rym: Hi, how are you your mom?

527
00:36:54,249 --> 00:36:58,583
Scott: Well that you know the content of it, but with knowing that who we are It's not.

528
00:36:58,624 --> 00:37:00,740
Scott: maybe maybe we knew who those people were.

529
00:37:01,121 --> 00:37:03,611
Scott: Maybe they're shit cocking is actually the same way.

530
00:37:03,631 --> 00:37:04,535
Scott: Your mom is for us.

531
00:37:05,057 --> 00:37:05,780
Rym: Is it really though?

532
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:06,622
Rym: Which would I?

533
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:11,719
Rym: join a chat with you and type a racial slur hundreds of times per second until you banned me?

534
00:37:12,841 --> 00:37:22,786
Scott: No only to come in with a different name and type a different racial slur But I mean like, you know I used to hang out with some Jews back in the day and we'd be like what up my kikes Yo, and it would be.

535
00:37:22,846 --> 00:37:23,790
Scott: you know, it's a funny thing.

536
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:34,052
Scott: But if you said that someone else it'd be like, oh shit You know, but like if I say it online I could go into a chat room and I'm like, you know A Jewish chat room like what up my kikes.

537
00:37:34,112 --> 00:37:40,100
Scott: it would be like shit cocking But if they would have known me and known our friends and had the context it wouldn't have been shit cocking.

538
00:37:40,401 --> 00:37:45,937
Scott: So there is I think I'm not gonna say that, you know, all shit cocking is just out of context.

539
00:37:45,977 --> 00:38:10,568
Scott: non shit cocking but what I will say is I think there is a portion of shit cocking of People who have things that they say in the context of their friends and closer social groups Set that are bringing those things, you know sort of out of bounds, you know They're taking their in jokes taking them out into the chat rooms of public world where they are Taken out of context and those viewed as shit cocking.

540
00:38:10,589 --> 00:38:15,545
Scott: and that is a portion of shit cocking perhaps a very small portion But it is but it is there.

541
00:38:15,746 --> 00:38:18,354
Rym: it does exist, but at least in those cases, it's still.

542
00:38:18,374 --> 00:38:20,400
Rym: there's an expectation of communication.

543
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,551
Scott: Yeah, it's not a hundred racial slurs in a flood.

544
00:38:23,631 --> 00:38:25,377
Scott: It's like one-liner plus.

545
00:38:25,417 --> 00:38:27,765
Rym: even then there's an Expectation of a response.

546
00:38:28,126 --> 00:38:28,587
Rym: notice how.

547
00:38:28,607 --> 00:38:36,051
Rym: I think that the real line between shit cock and not not in shit cock Specifically is whether or not you actually expect a response.

548
00:38:36,572 --> 00:38:41,879
Scott: Yeah, cuz flamers expect a response Response, you know trolls expect a response.

549
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:47,231
Scott: Shitcockers are just putting bad words in a flood and that's it.

550
00:38:47,411 --> 00:38:48,795
Scott: They don't expect a response.

551
00:38:48,815 --> 00:38:49,977
Scott: They're not gonna talk to you.

552
00:38:49,997 --> 00:38:52,979
Scott: They're just Spitting out lots of bad words.

553
00:38:53,321 --> 00:38:53,622
Scott: Maybe

554
00:38:53,782 --> 00:38:54,585
Rym: I wonder some

555
00:38:54,625 --> 00:39:00,260
Scott: of it is is definitely like, you know, the same way as like the little kid is not allowed to say bad Words, it's like oh my god, I can say bad words

556
00:39:00,801 --> 00:39:05,115
Rym: But there are so many of them and there are so many other places they could do this.

557
00:39:05,155 --> 00:39:09,373
Rym: the fact that they're doing it everywhere Simultaneously in real time 24/7 all the time.

558
00:39:09,654 --> 00:39:10,338
Scott: I don't know what they're doing.

559
00:39:10,338 --> 00:39:10,780
Scott: 24.

560
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,045
Rym: I think that we have to try this.

561
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:18,374
Rym: we have if we did a GeekNights you stream or and got enough people in on Christmas no, is it the same person all day?

562
00:39:18,475 --> 00:39:19,320
Scott: I mean, it's a rotating.

563
00:39:19,501 --> 00:39:25,840
Rym: I'm saying that at any second there is like in any public space that is big enough to warrant notice.

564
00:39:26,101 --> 00:39:28,190
Rym: There are people trying to shit cock there.

565
00:39:29,281 --> 00:39:35,200
Rym: Mmm, kind of like how on the internet if you have a cable modem and no net someone is hitting all your ports all the time.

566
00:39:35,481 --> 00:39:41,480
Rym: Yep, except on the internet, you know, literally it's just people typing fuck at all your ports all the time, right?

567
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:42,782
Scott: All right.

568
00:39:43,023 --> 00:39:43,826
Scott: So moving on.

569
00:39:43,846 --> 00:39:45,934
Scott: Oh, so let's you want to talk about.

570
00:39:45,954 --> 00:39:47,440
Scott: I had this problem today, right?

571
00:39:47,986 --> 00:39:48,653
Scott: What I wanted to do?

572
00:39:49,561 --> 00:39:54,280
Scott: As I'm on you stream, right and I'm sitting there and I want to teach some people some computer stuff, right?

573
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,003
Scott: So what could I do?

574
00:39:55,024 --> 00:39:57,356
Scott: I could point my webcam at my screen.

575
00:39:57,517 --> 00:39:57,960
Scott: not good.

576
00:39:58,442 --> 00:40:01,298
Scott: I could get a big whiteboard but Rym didn't order it yet, right?

577
00:40:01,319 --> 00:40:03,439
Rym: Yeah I got a big Amazon order in the queue.

578
00:40:03,941 --> 00:40:12,121
Scott: I could or I could go and find something that would basically take my screen and stream what's on my screen, right and their decks Huh?

579
00:40:12,302 --> 00:40:13,205
Rym: Webex does it really?

580
00:40:13,225 --> 00:40:15,794
Scott: Well, well, but see the thing is a commercial product though.

581
00:40:15,834 --> 00:40:17,340
Scott: Yeah, it's a commercial product, right?

582
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,852
Scott: There's something else webcam max also commercial product.

583
00:40:21,093 --> 00:40:22,197
Scott: There are a bunch of free ones.

584
00:40:22,498 --> 00:40:23,120
Scott: They all suck.

585
00:40:23,501 --> 00:40:29,520
Scott: There are some that do it like, you know a go-to meeting or something like or like a VNC kind of thing.

586
00:40:30,504 --> 00:40:30,785
Scott: You know.

587
00:40:30,805 --> 00:40:33,738
Scott: the problem with those is that they're not.

588
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:37,580
Scott: you know They're not like web-based video streams like YouTube like you stream.

589
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,389
Scott: They're like, you know, you connect to my computer kind of.

590
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:42,495
Scott: you know remote desktop things.

591
00:40:42,796 --> 00:40:48,010
Scott: It's completely different and Really there wasn't a solution there.

592
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:50,478
Scott: just there just wasn't like everything out there like.

593
00:40:50,518 --> 00:40:54,451
Scott: there were some Some almost solutions, but everything was pooped.

594
00:40:54,471 --> 00:41:00,220
Scott: There was like no way to take what was on my screen Stream it over streaming video in a web page.

595
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:16,100
Scott: I'll allow you stream with good enough resolution for people to see what was in my terminal Right and have it be really accessible to the viewer so that lots of people could watch but also have the communication Mechanisms integrate, you know the chat room and me talking to them and the whole right.

596
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,880
Scott: It's like I could have done this separate from the you stream.

597
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:23,380
Scott: But then people would I join the you stream and then also join that and also get a piece of software.

598
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,260
Scott: It was like so much work, you know just to make this happen where it should have been really easy.

599
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:42,624
Scott: And I think the best solution that I came up with was get a webcam Bust it open take out the camera Get some sort of device that has a VGA cable in one end and then connects to the camera spot on the webcam on the Other end.

600
00:41:42,906 --> 00:41:44,399
Scott: so it's basically VGA to USB.

601
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:59,664
Scott: So if it coming out of your video card into a device into your USB hole and thus it your computer treats Um, you know You duplicate the monitors using clone and then your computer would think the second monitor was also a webcam and would thus be able To stream it.

602
00:42:00,006 --> 00:42:01,939
Scott: Yeah, I couldn't find anything better than that.

603
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,992
Rym: See now I feel like the the market here right now.

604
00:42:05,032 --> 00:42:15,500
Rym: in the short term if you stream just had an option to Share a desktop they do but it's it's you have to get the stupid program that caused money If you stream could just do it without doing that.

605
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:20,013
Scott: Yeah The problem is on Windows right because the way Windows works the only that.

606
00:42:20,033 --> 00:42:24,227
Rym: what I was about to say is that if you just Share it as video that's still.

607
00:42:24,327 --> 00:42:27,999
Rym: that's a lot of bandwidth and it's gonna be really lossy and terrible compared to doing it.

608
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:38,438
Rym: You know like with the MSTC exactly but MSTC is not set up by default - like you can't just use that through something like ustream Yep an x-forwarding.

609
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:42,261
Scott: But yeah It's like.

610
00:42:42,301 --> 00:42:48,200
Scott: the way to do it right with the video part is you have to basically put a driver in Windows in between.

611
00:42:48,341 --> 00:42:51,818
Scott: You're like the mod is to be a webcam driver that picks up on.

612
00:42:51,939 --> 00:42:55,360
Scott: you know The video out and that's totally the wrong way to do it.

613
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,740
Scott: But because of the architecture of Windows that's the way it has to be done.

614
00:42:59,561 --> 00:43:02,574
Scott: Yeah, there was something called like webcam studio for Linux.

615
00:43:02,614 --> 00:43:03,900
Scott: I couldn't even get it to work on Ubuntu.

616
00:43:04,001 --> 00:43:06,599
Scott: It just didn't install and I didn't have time for that shit.

617
00:43:06,821 --> 00:43:10,680
Scott: There are a lot of solutions that required a lot of work and I wasn't about to deal with them.

618
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:16,320
Rym: I had that problem just looking for a screen scraper for my own desktop just to make some a way back.

619
00:43:16,501 --> 00:43:18,960
Scott: There's plenty of solutions to record your desk.

620
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:25,000
Rym: Oh there are but even then in Linux many of them either don't work or are really shitty.

621
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:26,707
Scott: Well xvidcap is fine.

622
00:43:26,767 --> 00:43:29,538
Scott: It's okay, but just the thing is you have to do the encoding yourself.

623
00:43:29,659 --> 00:43:31,938
Scott: afterwards It makes a gigantic full res AVI.

624
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:38,440
Scott: Yeah You know, but at least it doesn't destroy your performance like some of the other ones do that cuz they encode while they're going along.

625
00:43:38,842 --> 00:43:41,534
Scott: So it's like your performance goes to shit and you can't work.

626
00:43:41,875 --> 00:43:42,900
Rym: Yeah, of course, I got two cores.

627
00:43:43,001 --> 00:43:43,524
Rym: I could live with that.

628
00:43:43,544 --> 00:43:46,420
Rym: but now xvidcap worked pretty well, but it wasn't optimal.

629
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,966
Rym: It was just the best one and it doesn't.

630
00:43:48,047 --> 00:43:48,328
Scott: dogs.

631
00:43:48,368 --> 00:43:49,493
Scott: vidcap also, right?

632
00:43:49,553 --> 00:43:51,200
Scott: It might record the your screen.

633
00:43:51,823 --> 00:43:53,833
Scott: It doesn't record the audio so you have to do.

634
00:43:53,853 --> 00:44:01,154
Scott: you have to dub it later Yeah, or I mean or you push record in audacity at the same time Yeah, but that's nice still gets out of sync.

635
00:44:01,195 --> 00:44:01,880
Rym: You're gonna have trouble.

636
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:02,665
Scott: Yeah You need to.

637
00:44:02,908 --> 00:44:08,174
Scott: you need to record that Audio dub it in a program that also takes the video into account.

638
00:44:08,194 --> 00:44:09,920
Scott: so the dubbing is you know timed properly?

639
00:44:10,201 --> 00:44:14,140
Rym: Maybe our answer is just to have a big whiteboard and a camera.

640
00:44:14,461 --> 00:44:31,320
Scott: Yeah, but I also think having a computer where the VGA cable goes into you know Like a capture card or something would also Be like the correct solution that would work properly, you know It's still it just it really sucks because you shouldn't need hardware to do it, but I think we do

641
00:44:34,062 --> 00:44:34,866
Rym: All right, you got more.

642
00:44:34,966 --> 00:44:37,256
Rym: I I only remember the one I brought up.

643
00:44:37,337 --> 00:44:45,000
Scott: so, okay Someone wanted us to do a show about regular expressions and I was sort of like, you know Why should we do a show on regular expressions?

644
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,910
Scott: I mean first of all regular expressions are a very visual thing.

645
00:44:47,930 --> 00:45:00,147
Scott: if you're gonna teach them to someone you need like terminals and things, you know open and text editors that you can, you know, visually show what's all about and Also everything I've learned about regular expressions.

646
00:45:00,187 --> 00:45:01,131
Scott: I've learned from the internet.

647
00:45:01,211 --> 00:45:03,017
Scott: So this is also a web.

648
00:45:03,057 --> 00:45:03,820
Scott: There's one website.

649
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:04,824
Scott: You'll know if you find it.

650
00:45:04,904 --> 00:45:07,634
Scott: It's very high up on Google if you do searches for regular expressions.

651
00:45:07,694 --> 00:45:13,280
Scott: It's sort of orange ish and Yep, I've used that because that website has really everything you need to know.

652
00:45:13,561 --> 00:45:17,300
Rym: Yeah, because even you know, I use I use them on a daily basis constantly.

653
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:22,198
Rym: But every now all the time I'll forget some obscure syntax or I'll try to think of a like.

654
00:45:22,258 --> 00:45:23,464
Rym: I do something But it's kind of it.

655
00:45:23,524 --> 00:45:26,340
Scott: I pretty much need them as the need like a reference all the time.

656
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,280
Scott: Cuz I don't remember hardly any of the syntax.

657
00:45:28,521 --> 00:45:29,524
Rym: I remember all the more like.

658
00:45:29,604 --> 00:45:32,073
Scott: I'll come up with a regular expression, but I'll need.

659
00:45:32,213 --> 00:45:34,100
Scott: I'll hate it because it's not perfectly optimal.

660
00:45:34,261 --> 00:45:50,099
Rym: So I'll have to go search around like get it optimized or half the time I'll end up I'll use like a reg X. that gets the job half done and Then my output gets pipe set off something to get my real output or Grant pipe grant pipe grab when I could have done it with one red egg reg X.

661
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:52,454
Scott: Yep, just cuz you're not that good with the right.

662
00:45:52,474 --> 00:45:55,586
Scott: You're not a reg X wizard You just sort of know enough to get them to go.

663
00:45:55,887 --> 00:45:59,778
Scott: few people are few people are indeed mostly pearl people.

664
00:45:59,838 --> 00:46:00,620
Scott: are reg X wizards.

665
00:46:00,701 --> 00:46:03,220
Rym: Yeah, I mean I stare at command lines all day.

666
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:11,786
Rym: All I do is parse logs and other logs and track stuff through logs and I use reg X is constantly like I don't know About 50 an hour.

667
00:46:12,067 --> 00:46:13,472
Rym: Maybe I'm trying to come up with a met.

668
00:46:13,532 --> 00:46:15,278
Scott: I mean Django is in.

669
00:46:15,559 --> 00:46:16,924
Scott: you know you're doing web stuff.

670
00:46:17,185 --> 00:46:19,194
Scott: URL is all about URLs.

671
00:46:19,254 --> 00:46:24,260
Scott: parsing URLs and Verifying form fields is all regular expressions.

672
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:24,601
Scott: but

673
00:46:24,721 --> 00:46:41,715
Rym: for the layman if you're wondering what we're talking about if you a regular expression is a way to is a syntactical way to Parse text and generate an output that is transformed based on your rules so you can search through text Find what you're looking for in a very specific order.

674
00:46:41,755 --> 00:46:42,940
Scott: So so there's two parts.

675
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,775
Scott: There's the matching right of text and there's also the parsing of text, right?

676
00:46:47,795 --> 00:46:59,336
Scott: So the matching goes something like this Let's say I have a regular expression that is like, you know You know, I I'm not gonna actually speak in the syntax of regular expressions cuz that won't.

677
00:46:59,477 --> 00:47:00,400
Scott: it'll just confuse the hell.

678
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,166
Rym: It'll sound like DCS.

679
00:47:02,186 --> 00:47:05,036
Scott: But let's say let's say I'm looking for a phone number, right?

680
00:47:05,136 --> 00:47:06,180
Scott: I'm looking for a phone number.

681
00:47:06,261 --> 00:47:08,580
Scott: I want to know what the person typed in is a phone number.

682
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:16,600
Scott: So we've I say three digits followed by a hyphen followed by three digits followed by a hyphen followed by four digits, right?

683
00:47:17,002 --> 00:47:19,213
Scott: So there's a language where I can type in.

684
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:33,413
Scott: it would be something like, you know Backslash D curly brace 3 - backslash D curly brace 3 - backslash D curly brace 4 Right and what that would say is three digits followed by - Bob, right?

685
00:47:33,835 --> 00:47:38,520
Scott: So then I can tell the computer Here's my regular expression the shit with all the curly braces.

686
00:47:39,002 --> 00:47:42,038
Scott: Here's here's the part the thing the person typed in.

687
00:47:42,601 --> 00:47:43,343
Scott: Does it match?

688
00:47:43,423 --> 00:47:48,140
Scott: and if the person typed in a phone number meaning three digits followed by a hyphen and so on?

689
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:50,078
Scott: It'll give me a yes thumbs up.

690
00:47:50,561 --> 00:47:58,398
Scott: And if what they typed in has like letters in it or has four digits followed by three digits followed by a slash It'll say thumbs down.

691
00:47:58,881 --> 00:48:01,290
Scott: So that's the first thing you can do with regular expressions.

692
00:48:01,632 --> 00:48:03,820
Scott: is you say does this match thus?

693
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:12,377
Scott: You can take some unknown input that is text right or numbers and symbols and Determine if it matches this format that you're looking for.

694
00:48:12,497 --> 00:48:13,000
Rym: now to it.

695
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:15,371
Rym: Just just to give you an idea of how powerful this is.

696
00:48:15,994 --> 00:48:40,792
Rym: just on this front part You could trivially write a rule that also, you know It could look for this three digits that may or may not be surrounded by parentheses followed by either a space or a hyphen or the parentheses from before and then four digits and Actually and then three more digits and then four digits with or without that whole first section so you could Find out like you could look for almost any format.

697
00:48:40,832 --> 00:48:42,199
Rym: Someone could type a phone number in.

698
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:44,209
Scott: Yeah go online and look for something.

699
00:48:44,391 --> 00:49:02,540
Scott: go do searches for like Email address regular expressions and they'll people will have all these different crazy regular expressions that match like they match anything that could possibly be an email address and Don't match things that are not email addresses and it gets pretty crazy.

700
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:07,960
Scott: But it's it's ridiculously powerful and it you know, it has lots and lots of applications.

701
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:15,512
Scott: Like I said, let's say you're making a website and you have people typing things into the boxes on the website And you want to make sure that what they typed in is correct.

702
00:49:15,954 --> 00:49:17,120
Scott: You could use the regular expression.

703
00:49:17,542 --> 00:49:26,720
Scott: Let's say you've got a big file full of I don't know Like like data right and you want to look and it's just a text file.

704
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,840
Scott: It's not in a nice spreadsheet or anything and you want to look for people who live in New York.

705
00:49:31,241 --> 00:49:37,360
Scott: So you can you know do a regular expression looking for and why capital with spaces around it?

706
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:46,520
Scott: You know all sorts of you know different combinations of things that that will result in that being a you know And you could say give me any line in this file.

707
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:48,286
Scott: This is what grep the program grep does.

708
00:49:48,326 --> 00:49:56,440
Scott: you'd be like give me any line in this file where you see the letters NY And it will only spit out those lines in the file and not spit out the other lines.

709
00:49:56,581 --> 00:50:03,712
Rym: Yep, and they're great for looking through log files, you know I want to see every message that were sent to or from this list of three clients.

710
00:50:04,033 --> 00:50:06,540
Rym: that involves a timeout on this thing.

711
00:50:06,741 --> 00:50:11,900
Scott: Yeah, I've got this big old file full of all the logs everything that the web server has done for the past hour.

712
00:50:12,482 --> 00:50:21,780
Scott: Give me every line in this file that has the word error in it so I can just see the errors Or you can use them programmatically for things like log channels like say you write complex programs or demons.

713
00:50:22,382 --> 00:50:28,280
Rym: So say you have every log line start with an integer from 1 to 9 and then a space and then the line.

714
00:50:28,744 --> 00:50:49,760
Rym: so you could designate say that Channel 1 is major errors channel 2 is minor errors channel 4 is debug channel 9 is like infer events No one cares about and you can have a log Masker that uses regular expressions that will basically say if the log line I'm about to write is in channel 4, you know, it begins with an integer for then write it.

715
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:51,887
Rym: Otherwise don't unless I change the log mask.

716
00:50:52,148 --> 00:50:52,269
Rym: Yep.

717
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:57,589
Scott: So there are lots and lots of ways to just use the matching Capabilities of regular expressions.

718
00:50:57,609 --> 00:50:59,520
Scott: We haven't even scratched the surface on that, right?

719
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:01,166
Scott: I mean you use something like awk.

720
00:51:01,267 --> 00:51:02,451
Scott: you're going way you can.

721
00:51:02,552 --> 00:51:06,846
Scott: it's crazy powerful crazy powerful But you think that's powerful.

722
00:51:06,906 --> 00:51:13,363
Scott: regular expressions have one other function and that is the you know the parsing Functionality.

723
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:16,579
Scott: so what you can do is you can say let's say I'm do I'll use the phone number again, right?

724
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,949
Scott: So I'm doing the phone number and the phone number.

725
00:51:18,989 --> 00:51:21,240
Scott: has you know that area code at the beginning, right?

726
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:28,220
Scott: So I can say match a phone number three digits followed by whatever followed by three digits followed by four right four digits.

727
00:51:28,803 --> 00:51:32,260
Scott: But I put some parentheses around those first three digits.

728
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:45,280
Scott: Now I can say all right look at this whole big file Find anything that matches a phone number and then spit out just the just the area code part.

729
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:50,497
Scott: Give me that area code part so you can extract parts of what you have matched, right?

730
00:51:50,517 --> 00:52:03,540
Scott: It's like I could match Email addresses and I can just pull out just the domain part, you know I could like just give me all the domains and I could see like how many Yahoo.com email addresses are in here how many gmail.com email addresses are in here?

731
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:11,129
Scott: You know, I could go in and you could you know, so by pulling out different parts You can actually start to do some really crazy stuff.

732
00:52:11,209 --> 00:52:14,220
Scott: Like I have a script I wrote that will rename.

733
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:19,760
Scott: You know, you download an anime fan sub right and the file name is this crazy fucked up thing, right?

734
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,945
Scott: You've got and people do it all different ways You know and they've got.

735
00:52:22,986 --> 00:52:24,940
Scott: they put in like the name of the fan sub are in there.

736
00:52:25,161 --> 00:52:26,649
Scott: You got the episode number in there.

737
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:28,800
Scott: You got the file extension in there, right?

738
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,244
Scott: You got all this junk in there.

739
00:52:30,725 --> 00:52:37,646
Scott: So I'll wrote this program that basically it checks to see if you know This, you know file.

740
00:52:37,706 --> 00:52:41,400
Scott: it looks at all the file names in the folder and it says does this file name match?

741
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:44,649
Scott: You know, is it a anime fan sub?

742
00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:48,360
Scott: All right, so it mostly looks for like an MKV or a VI file extension.

743
00:52:48,521 --> 00:52:57,540
Scott: Right, then it says if it is Extract out right the name of the show and extract out the episode number, right?

744
00:52:57,802 --> 00:53:05,140
Scott: Get rid of the rest of the shit and rename it to Name of show space - space episode number dot file extension.

745
00:53:05,442 --> 00:53:07,090
Rym: You could even really set it up to where.

746
00:53:07,492 --> 00:53:10,608
Rym: if you can't parse it properly Like you can set up the expression to where.

747
00:53:11,231 --> 00:53:17,620
Rym: if it doesn't fit any of your cases Flag it with like, you know four X's at the beginning and then I'll go through and sort those manual.

748
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:19,380
Scott: Yeah, you could you know and then I can you know.

749
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:25,460
Scott: Once I see that that case didn't match I can then go back and modify my regular expression to match that case in the future.

750
00:53:26,122 --> 00:53:32,040
Scott: So, you know, it's the regular expressions are you know an evolving thing sometimes when you don't have, you know consistency.

751
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:35,540
Scott: It's like when you have some consistently structured textual data.

752
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:40,580
Scott: They're very useful because you can process large quantities very easily and very reliably.

753
00:53:41,001 --> 00:53:52,080
Scott: But when you have small amounts of inconsistent data or even large amounts of inconsistent data They're equally powerful because it's the only thing you can do to search inconsistent data is a regular expression.

754
00:53:52,421 --> 00:54:04,408
Scott: There's no way to search something that's all fucked up, you know with an with an actual search function because you know something that's more straightforward because you're not gonna find anything and That's that's what regular expressions are all about.

755
00:54:04,489 --> 00:54:23,380
Scott: And if you have to deal, you know with text or matching or searching or finding and replacing or Renaming or verifying or anything along those lines, you know in computers regular expressions is something you should learn And I think as you know, there really isn't going to be a replacement for them.

756
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:27,053
Scott: They're pretty much it, you know, and they're gonna be it for quite a long time.

757
00:54:27,214 --> 00:54:34,720
Scott: I mean, we'll still be using regular expressions probably 10 if not 20 years from now that there's really nothing else we can do about it.

758
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:37,172
Rym: We'll be using them until we have semantic computing.

759
00:54:37,293 --> 00:54:38,600
Scott: Yeah, pretty much so.

760
00:54:39,561 --> 00:54:46,440
Scott: It's worth your while to learn them and to learn how to use them and to learn to write simple scripty programs that utilize them.

761
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:47,826
Scott: Because that you know.

762
00:54:47,866 --> 00:54:54,240
Scott: learn, you know, there are two the main things you have to learn, you know You can learn said which is like this straightforward regular expression tool.

763
00:54:54,521 --> 00:54:58,140
Scott: Yeah, you can learn auk which is a super powerful regular expression tool.

764
00:54:58,742 --> 00:55:03,540
Rym: You can and you can learn simple way to remember say grant is a stream editor.

765
00:55:03,841 --> 00:55:10,360
Rym: So you can basically take a file pipe it into said and then the output will be transformed by whatever expression you build.

766
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:16,060
Rym: So you could say replace the letter a with the letter F on every file on my hard drive.

767
00:55:16,422 --> 00:55:17,830
Scott: yep, said can do that right.

768
00:55:18,555 --> 00:55:20,144
Scott: auk is basically.

769
00:55:20,225 --> 00:55:25,717
Scott: you put something into auk and you give auk a bunch of expressions and you say auk whenever you see this expression.

770
00:55:25,758 --> 00:55:33,846
Scott: do this So it can go through a file or whatever you give to it and whenever it sees a certain expression that it's looking for It does something right.

771
00:55:34,568 --> 00:55:36,816
Scott: so you that's in ridiculously powerful.

772
00:55:36,897 --> 00:55:40,840
Scott: Once you learn how to use it You can use grep which is pretty much search for something.

773
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:44,700
Scott: So you got a folder full of files and you want to look, you know through those files.

774
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:51,700
Scott: Let's say you're working on a program and there's a function called fubar and you don't know which file the fubar function is in.

775
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:52,843
Scott: Well grep is the winner.

776
00:55:53,746 --> 00:56:13,093
Scott: and lastly, you know in your programming language of choice Python Ruby Perl bash Whatever you can learn how to use the regular expression tools Provided by that programming language to write full-on programs that can use regular expressions for searching replacing verifying matching whatever PHP whatever.

777
00:56:13,396 --> 00:56:13,819
Scott: it's all good.

778
00:56:14,942 --> 00:56:18,100
Rym: All right, we've actually gone on pretty well and maybe we can end there.

779
00:56:18,261 --> 00:56:18,683
Scott: You don't want to.

780
00:56:18,723 --> 00:56:20,151
Scott: you want to do another one or that's it.

781
00:56:20,271 --> 00:56:20,915
Rym: It's been a while.

782
00:56:20,955 --> 00:56:21,840
Rym: I think we can stop for now.

783
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:24,531
Rym: I think I think it was a good proof of concept and it killed a Monday.

784
00:56:24,551 --> 00:56:25,234
Scott: All right.

785
00:56:25,636 --> 00:56:25,957
Scott: All right.

786
00:56:25,998 --> 00:56:35,791
Rym: Yes This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

787
00:56:35,811 --> 00:56:37,940
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music.

788
00:56:38,646 --> 00:56:49,840
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at www.frontroadcrew.com Where you'll find show notes links our awesome forum a link to our frapper map and links to all the RSS feeds.

789
00:56:50,421 --> 00:56:56,060
Rym: We say feeds plural because GeekNights airs four nights a week covering four different brands of geekery.

790
00:56:56,622 --> 00:56:58,791
Rym: Mondays are science and technology Tuesdays.

791
00:56:58,831 --> 00:57:00,880
Rym: We have video games board games and RPGs.

792
00:57:01,301 --> 00:57:06,720
Rym: Wednesdays are anime manga comic nights and Thursdays are the catch-alls for various rants and tomfoolery.

793
00:57:07,161 --> 00:57:15,140
Scott: You can send us feedback by email to GeekNights at front row crew comm Or you can send audio feedback via audio.

794
00:57:15,602 --> 00:57:18,820
Scott: Just click the link that says send me an audio on the right side of our website.

795
00:57:19,163 --> 00:57:24,330
Rym: If you like what you hear you can catch the last 100 episodes in iTunes or in your favorite podcatcher.

796
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:27,660

799
00:57:36,888 --> 00:57:45,091
Scott: As long as you give us credit don't make money and share it in kind GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

800
00:57:45,492 --> 00:57:47,016
Scott: But unlike those other late shows.

801
00:57:47,317 --> 00:57:48,620
Scott: It's actually recorded at night.
