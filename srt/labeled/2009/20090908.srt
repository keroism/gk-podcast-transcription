00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,298
Scott: It's Tuesday September 8th.

2
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:12,021
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,282 --> 00:00:14,650
Scott: I'm Rym, and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:15,312 --> 00:00:18,436
Scott: packs 2009 in your face.

5
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,942
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:31,148 --> 00:00:34,900
Rym: and we are back from packs 2009. it was it was like the best packs ever.

7
00:00:35,482 --> 00:00:37,670
Scott: Why are you spoiling it like that spoilers?

8
00:00:38,251 --> 00:00:39,700
Scott: Yes, I mean we.

9
00:00:40,163 --> 00:00:44,443
Scott: we went to packs last year And we were like oh my gosh the best card in the universe.

10
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:51,250
Scott: and then I was going again this year And I'm like well, I wonder was it actually the best card in the universe?

11
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,821
Scott: I mean was I just like real excited?

12
00:00:54,464 --> 00:00:55,508
Scott: was I hallucinating?

13
00:00:56,352 --> 00:00:56,855
Scott: Are they you know?

14
00:00:56,895 --> 00:00:58,102
Scott: was it a one-time deal?

15
00:00:58,142 --> 00:00:59,409
Scott: is it gonna be that good again?

16
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,604
Rym: I mean I remember you know our first Otakon and we were like amazed by it.

17
00:01:02,624 --> 00:01:12,482
Rym: as time went on we got more and more Jaded and also you know only the two of us went last year so the rest of the crew Basically had to listen to us every day for the next six months.

18
00:01:12,522 --> 00:01:13,726
Rym: talk about how great packs was.

19
00:01:13,767 --> 00:01:18,250
Rym: no every other com sucks To the point that I don't think anyone believed any anything.

20
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:18,752
Scott: We.

21
00:01:18,772 --> 00:01:25,225
Scott: I began to not believe myself much like when I watched Evangelion then didn't watch it for many years Then watched it again.

22
00:01:25,871 --> 00:01:28,721
Scott: packs is the same way and of course the same exact result.

23
00:01:28,762 --> 00:01:34,808
Scott: I watch it again the second time and I say What the fuck was I thinking this is better than I even thought it was the first time I?

24
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,342
Rym: It was such a great convention, and it was.

25
00:01:38,563 --> 00:01:39,790
Rym: it was better than last year part.

26
00:01:39,911 --> 00:01:41,649
Rym: I mean the mystique was gone.

27
00:01:41,971 --> 00:01:43,917
Rym: But at the same time what replaced it was?

28
00:01:43,977 --> 00:01:48,667
Rym: I left before knowledge and the ability to plan and for like I knew what to expect.

29
00:01:49,671 --> 00:01:51,439
Scott: Mm-hmm yep that helped a lot plus.

30
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:54,235
Rym: I played a lot more games this year as definitely You know that's.

31
00:01:54,376 --> 00:01:55,830
Scott: one thing is a gaming convention.

32
00:01:56,912 --> 00:01:58,020
Scott: Play fucking games.

33
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:58,624
Scott: It's you know.

34
00:01:58,664 --> 00:02:01,058
Scott: I mean like last year I didn't play nearly enough games.

35
00:02:01,139 --> 00:02:01,561
Scott: you know what?

36
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,516
Scott: some of the most fun times at a gaming convention They're just playing games.

37
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:08,014
Scott: so any time I didn't have something I forget.

38
00:02:08,054 --> 00:02:17,658
Rym: just bam playing games first before we continue into the full review of facts And hopefully we'll be able to get through all of this tonight without having to extend into Thursday But we'll just make a real long one.

39
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,150
Rym: welcome all of you new listeners to GeekNights.

40
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:21,575
Scott: It's a hope you exist.

41
00:02:21,816 --> 00:02:24,828
Rym: there are four different nights of GeekNights, so this is Tuesday night.

42
00:02:24,848 --> 00:02:25,410
Rym: You know gaming.

43
00:02:25,551 --> 00:02:29,930
Rym: I apologize to our regular listeners that we're doing another Tuesday's show too soon.

44
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,010
Rym: We should have been doing a Monday show, but we were still in Seattle.

45
00:02:33,171 --> 00:02:38,068
Scott: I think it'll make a much better packs show because we are doing it so quickly.

46
00:02:38,128 --> 00:02:38,690
Scott: after the packs.

47
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:42,306
Scott: We won't forget everything and I have a bunch of notes here too, but you can all relax.

48
00:02:42,487 --> 00:02:46,590
Rym: unlike last year We will not do three hour and a half long shows about packs.

49
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,994
Scott: No We'll just do this show.

50
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:51,830
Rym: and that's it though that might let you in on how excited we were after last packs.

51
00:02:51,951 --> 00:02:56,530
Rym: But you know the story of packs we wanted to go since the first pack since we heard there.

52
00:02:56,811 --> 00:02:58,982
Scott: This is only I think packs number six or seven.

53
00:02:59,002 --> 00:03:00,510
Scott: so yeah, we haven't missed too many.

54
00:03:00,773 --> 00:03:02,090
Rym: We could have gone to all of them.

55
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,155
Rym: We just didn't want it enough.

56
00:03:03,175 --> 00:03:06,070
Scott: we'll go on all the PAX East's and hopefully they won't be bad.

57
00:03:06,411 --> 00:03:08,679
Rym: Oh my god, but we came back.

58
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:10,887
Rym: We went back to packs, and it was the best thing ever.

59
00:03:10,947 --> 00:03:15,197
Rym: so new listeners Gaming is just one quarter of what we do.

60
00:03:15,238 --> 00:03:22,790
Rym: so Mondays are science and tech and Wednesdays are anime and manga and comics and all That stuff and Thursdays are things that sometimes get us in trouble and weird stuff.

61
00:03:23,394 --> 00:03:28,958
Scott: And although this will be the last this would be the only Packs episode I can see in the future.

62
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:33,350
Scott: the near future at least all the Tuesday episodes are probably gonna be packs related things.

63
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:36,843
Rym: We've probably planned the next two months worth of Tuesday episodes.

64
00:03:37,144 --> 00:03:47,262
Scott: Yeah, like well like next year's Another packs will happen at least next six months, and then it'll be PAX East And that'll give us the next six months and so and so on so forth.

65
00:03:47,543 --> 00:03:48,306
Rym: so blah blah blah.

66
00:03:48,326 --> 00:03:49,530
Rym: if you're new join the forums.

67
00:03:49,631 --> 00:03:50,867
Rym: They're great yada yada, whatever.

68
00:03:52,014 --> 00:04:02,729
Rym: That aside before we get into facts I want to say this and we say this all the time and everyone if hack says this But the enforcers you guys made that can't happen and like it's not just you know we're saying this

69
00:04:03,391 --> 00:04:03,892
Scott: Individual

70
00:04:03,932 --> 00:04:11,270
Rym: enforcers very specifically and directly made our personal packs better for being cool and helping us out more than once.

71
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:14,620
Scott: Yeah, I wanna let's see which which enforcer is totally awesome.

72
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,914
Scott: all the enforcers managing the Raven theater Ah the Raven.

73
00:04:19,255 --> 00:04:22,510
Scott: all the enforcers in the Wolfman theater equally awesome.

74
00:04:22,671 --> 00:04:23,095
Rym: I'm still.

75
00:04:23,176 --> 00:04:24,749
Rym: I'm so sad that we stole.

76
00:04:25,931 --> 00:04:28,882
Rym: We'll tell that when we get to all the enforcers at the.

77
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:30,287
Scott: bring your own computer area.

78
00:04:30,448 --> 00:04:32,775
Rym: Oh my god For some dudes.

79
00:04:32,996 --> 00:04:35,970
Rym: I forgot all your names, but I gave you business cards if you were cool.

80
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:43,810
Scott: There's who handled the main events all the enforcers who are giving out the badges.

81
00:04:44,091 --> 00:04:49,250
Rym: Seriously the enforcers at packs are like a breed above and beyond the staff of any other convention.

82
00:04:49,371 --> 00:05:04,127
Rym: It is telling that more than one packs enforcer said had a disparaging comment to make about soccer account the local anime con out there and They basically express everything that we always say that anime cons have terrible staff and packs has solved the.

83
00:05:04,348 --> 00:05:05,150
Rym: how do you have good staff?

84
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,398
Scott: Problem all the enforcers of the tabletop check-in check-out.

85
00:05:08,999 --> 00:05:13,510
Scott: all the enforcers at the retro game and all the enforcers in the DS lounge.

86
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:19,425
Scott: Uh all the other enforcers I didn't really hang out with anyone in a utility any.

87
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:20,990
Scott: all the enforcers around utility kilts.

88
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:30,398
Rym: Okay, what says it best is that at the very end when gave and taiko come out for the omega-thon finale And they thank all the enforcers.

89
00:05:30,418 --> 00:05:31,725
Rym: He doesn't just say you know.

90
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:32,690
Rym: Thank you enforcers.

91
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:38,209
Rym: He says basically thanks to all the people who are dedicated enough to take on the black this year.

92
00:05:38,531 --> 00:05:42,490
Rym: Yeah, that is the level that the packs enforcer is at one pack.

93
00:05:42,811 --> 00:05:52,710
Rym: It's kind of like the old saying one riot one Texas Ranger One packs enforcer is worth like 20 Otakon gophers and at least like five or six Otakon staff.

94
00:05:52,931 --> 00:05:55,697
Rym: Sorry Otakon, but seriously yeah, that's right.

95
00:05:56,359 --> 00:05:58,705
Scott: Okay, so let's do our chronology.

96
00:05:58,725 --> 00:05:59,647
Scott: So we don't forget things.

97
00:05:59,687 --> 00:06:00,670
Rym: Let's jump right in now.

98
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:03,440
Scott: We got in the train.

99
00:06:03,461 --> 00:06:04,368
Scott: it was a train in New York.

100
00:06:04,911 --> 00:06:10,547
Rym: Well, we basically we had to drive to Scott's to Emily's and Alex's apartment walk to the train to the train station.

101
00:06:10,567 --> 00:06:14,630
Scott: so car feet Took the trains in New York train car feet train.

102
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:18,670
Scott: We had to take a bus bus to the airport car feet train bus and a plane.

103
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:27,730
Rym: Carfeet train bus plane and a taxi taxi, and then we were a pax and because we stayed at the Sheraton We were basically like a hundred feet away from back.

104
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,220
Scott: It was pretty much the closest possible hotel, which is awesome.

105
00:06:30,401 --> 00:06:36,665
Rym: Not as good of a hotel as the red lion though I'm going back to the red line the red lines only a block farther away, and it's better.

106
00:06:36,685 --> 00:06:38,090
Rym: It was just so much better.

107
00:06:38,452 --> 00:06:40,943
Scott: Yeah, no the closeness was really really nice.

108
00:06:41,405 --> 00:06:45,744
Rym: Yeah, I was always kind of surprised I'd stagger out of packs at like 3 a.m.. And you know and suddenly.

109
00:06:45,784 --> 00:06:46,990
Rym: I'm already like in my hotel.

110
00:06:47,171 --> 00:06:50,042
Scott: Yeah, I'm definitely getting the Hilton for Otakon cuz it's just so worth it.

111
00:06:50,142 --> 00:06:57,018
Scott: like you don't even realize how far the Renaissance is Until you've been closer Anyway, so yeah, uh let's see what.

112
00:06:57,339 --> 00:07:00,950
Scott: Oh JetBlue right JetBlue's new terminal at JFK is totally awesome.

113
00:07:01,594 --> 00:07:02,560
Scott: It has a Muji store.

114
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,058
Scott: if you're flying somewhere Go JetBlue at JFK.

115
00:07:06,138 --> 00:07:08,990
Rym: if we're not chills for JetBlue Scott is just a JetBlue fanboy.

116
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:09,953
Scott: You see that terminal.

117
00:07:10,435 --> 00:07:12,020
Scott: you seem to terminal like that your last terminal.

118
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:20,206
Rym: however it helped us out because you know one trouble I always have at conventions is not remembering to carry business cards around and when people give me business cards.

119
00:07:20,627 --> 00:07:26,170
Rym: I lose them In the Muji store of all things we're looking and Scott says hey business card holders.

120
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,443
Scott: well I was I was just in the store looking around.

121
00:07:28,503 --> 00:07:35,250
Scott: then it came to my mind a Business card holder would probably be something this store has and it's something I need and they had a selection of three.

122
00:07:35,513 --> 00:07:36,670
Rym: Well, here's the thing Scott was looking.

123
00:07:36,711 --> 00:07:37,932
Rym: He's like check this out We should get it.

124
00:07:38,253 --> 00:07:43,717
Rym: and I point out that now the one you're looking at is inferior because the one I'm holding has two Separate sections.

125
00:07:43,737 --> 00:07:50,250
Scott: well I had seen that one already And I dismissed it because it was ludicrously expensive compared to the other one and I'm like who the fuck needs two slots?

126
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:51,373
Rym: Ah two slots.

127
00:07:51,674 --> 00:07:57,110
Rym: the magic is that one slot is for your business cards and the other is for everyone else's business card.

128
00:07:57,351 --> 00:08:03,569
Scott: And once I realized this key piece of information we purchased the double slot business card holders on the Muji store.

129
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:06,110
Rym: of course I've got these stack of business cards in front of me.

130
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,399
Rym: I have to email everyone that I talked to at the con.

131
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:13,249
Scott: all right so moving on very quickly cuz we don't have a lot Of time we got to get right up to the pack stuff.

132
00:08:13,671 --> 00:08:15,719
Scott: Oh, I mean guy crow was on our airplane.

133
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,204
Scott: We didn't talk to him though until later.

134
00:08:17,224 --> 00:08:19,754
Rym: Yep, not that much later I mean Friday morning.

135
00:08:19,835 --> 00:08:22,527
Scott: Yeah, I know right, but yeah, I was like is that a guy crow?

136
00:08:22,648 --> 00:08:29,919
Scott: and then yes It was but I don't really have much to say to him because I all I know is that he's a famous game reviewer But I don't really read his reviews or know anything honest.

137
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,289
Rym: all I know about him is that David Riley is a fanboy for him.

138
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:35,035
Rym: He is almost gar for him.

139
00:08:35,116 --> 00:08:35,938
Rym: It's kind of funny.

140
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:41,575
Scott: Yeah, I mean if say Yahtzee who wasn't there or James Rolfe was there.

141
00:08:41,635 --> 00:08:44,087
Scott: I would add something to say to them, but I didn't have anything to say.

142
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:51,750
Rym: to end guy crawl Say we got our badges Thursday, so one cool thing this year They kind of they pushed the badge pickup over to the Grand Hyatt.

143
00:08:52,051 --> 00:08:54,238
Rym: They had this whole separate like function area set up.

144
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:58,412
Rym: one little room over there was taken up by this LSU thing that we'll talk About later.

145
00:08:58,452 --> 00:09:01,906
Scott: that was oh, yeah, basically, it's the start of college football season.

146
00:09:01,946 --> 00:09:02,890
Rym: We'll talk about it right now.

147
00:09:03,115 --> 00:09:11,712
Scott: Okay So Louisiana State University people were all over Seattle because their first game was an away game against I guess WSU.

148
00:09:11,893 --> 00:09:13,197
Rym: I will say one thing over there.

149
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:19,295
Rym: anyone who thinks gamers are immature those LSU people were Thousand times more annoying.

150
00:09:19,436 --> 00:09:23,869
Scott: basically the whole city of Seattle was occupied by Paxers and LSU people.

151
00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:25,455
Rym: yes But I know Pax people did not.

152
00:09:25,576 --> 00:09:29,914
Rym: at restaurants while everyone's trying to eat start shouting slogans as loud as they can and banging on The tables.

153
00:09:30,156 --> 00:09:31,648
Scott: yeah, you only do that at the game guys.

154
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,195
Scott: Keep you know at the game.

155
00:09:33,255 --> 00:09:37,429
Scott: totally awesome at the at the dinner at the restaurant not totally awesome.

156
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:48,350
Rym: now The great thing is and this is still my Karthago Delendim S for all of the stupid anime conventions that don't do this Pax mails out the badges so we literally showed up and Emily had to pick up her badge.

157
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:50,478
Rym: She didn't pre-reg in time to get it mailed to her.

158
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:58,530
Rym: so we walk in and the enforcer who knows what's up is like All right, you go that way, and oh you guys special go this way, so we walk two different ways.

159
00:09:59,052 --> 00:10:03,210
Rym: We both end up in the same room the same empty room except for some enforcers.

160
00:10:03,692 --> 00:10:07,108
Rym: There are more enforcers in that room than there were people needing badges.

161
00:10:07,248 --> 00:10:12,024
Scott: yep And then we just got our badges immediately because it was no line.

162
00:10:12,284 --> 00:10:13,990
Scott: cuz everyone got the mail to them.

163
00:10:14,311 --> 00:10:15,157
Rym: You know it's so great.

164
00:10:15,177 --> 00:10:20,644
Rym: You know I go to Pax, and it's like guy I am Rym from GeekNights, and they're like shall I warm says crack pipe.

165
00:10:20,985 --> 00:10:23,232
Rym: here says badge Warmed.

166
00:10:23,252 --> 00:10:26,862
Rym: I got an account of like who you again We lost your thing.

167
00:10:26,902 --> 00:10:27,749
Rym: go to this other line.

168
00:10:28,092 --> 00:10:29,543
Rym: Exactly right.

169
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:30,570
Scott: so we got our badges.

170
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:32,789
Scott: It was a wonderful experience getting our badges.

171
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:37,990
Scott: Then we went and did because last year me and Rym spent the whole Labor Day in Seattle.

172
00:10:38,091 --> 00:10:40,428
Scott: So we did all the Seattle touristy stuff like the Space Needle.

173
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:44,850
Scott: But we weren't staying Monday this year and Emily and Alex were there who had never been to Seattle.

174
00:10:45,272 --> 00:10:54,805
Scott: So we quickly after getting our badges did a whole bunch of Seattle touristy stuff such as Seeing the chocolate pasta down at the market and eating some buns of the Chinese bakery.

175
00:10:54,886 --> 00:10:55,367
Rym: Oh my god.

176
00:10:55,407 --> 00:10:56,150
Rym: That's sticky rice.

177
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:57,375
Scott: Yeah, I was good.

178
00:10:57,395 --> 00:10:58,259
Scott: Tell about the sticky rice.

179
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,665
Rym: It was it was his magic.

180
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:00,770
Scott: I just had a normal bean bun.

181
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,319
Rym: It was this mystical sticky rice.

182
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,110
Rym: It looked like just sticky rice, so I got it.

183
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:10,350
Rym: But as I'm eating it I come across a little pocket of chicken curry a little pocket of sausage a little pocket of squash.

184
00:11:10,973 --> 00:11:11,676
Rym: It was beautiful.

185
00:11:11,696 --> 00:11:13,425
Scott: It was if I would have known that that I see.

186
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:14,490
Scott: I didn't notice the sticky rice.

187
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,036
Scott: I had already bought my bean bun.

188
00:11:16,097 --> 00:11:16,860
Scott: I was too slow.

189
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,788
Scott: I could have gotten that sticky rice.

190
00:11:18,848 --> 00:11:19,350
Rym: I missed out.

191
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,644
Rym: That was that was one of the better sticky rice as I've eaten.

192
00:11:22,087 --> 00:11:22,510
Scott: all right.

193
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:30,302
Rym: So the only real thing I have to point out is that one they knew they were gonna sell out Gigantic pre-made banners saying we are out of badges.

194
00:11:30,342 --> 00:11:34,741
Rym: do not even try yep with a little sad Hey signs all over the convention center.

195
00:11:34,842 --> 00:11:35,506
Scott: No badges.

196
00:11:35,566 --> 00:11:36,230
Scott: No badges.

197
00:11:37,251 --> 00:11:39,462
Scott: Anyway, all right, so we also.

198
00:11:39,522 --> 00:11:40,245
Rym: we hung out with.

199
00:11:40,286 --> 00:11:41,230
Rym: you know our PAX friends.

200
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,230
Rym: We have the Azen posse and the West Coast crew.

201
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:48,987
Rym: But the head of that is basically row and Jeremy who are two awesome listeners and friends that they're there.

202
00:11:49,088 --> 00:11:50,212
Scott: as far as I'm concerned They have.

203
00:11:50,313 --> 00:11:52,123
Scott: they're now at the top of the listener chart.

204
00:11:52,163 --> 00:11:53,410
Scott: They're number one listeners.

205
00:11:53,692 --> 00:12:00,003
Rym: I gotta give a shout out to robe largely because she made these GeekNights buttons and Went around doing the PAX forum button ear thing.

206
00:12:00,084 --> 00:12:01,150
Scott: Oh, yeah, there's a button ear thing.

207
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:04,650
Scott: Basically, you know what Otakon like if you make buttons, you'll sell them in artist alley.

208
00:12:04,811 --> 00:12:11,450
Scott: well, it packs everyone makes buttons or at least a lot of people do and Then you basically trade buttons with everyone else who's also a button person.

209
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:16,350
Scott: So it's like hey, I've got a thousand buttons that are mine that identify me and then you got buttons.

210
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:23,909
Scott: So I'll trade with you and I'll trade and then hopefully if everyone makes the same number and everyone has one for everyone Everyone will end up with the same button set at the end.

211
00:12:24,171 --> 00:12:27,225
Rym: Well, except that a lot of industry people make buttons too and they'll have limited.

212
00:12:27,245 --> 00:12:29,716
Rym: like one guy was like I got 700 come and get him.

213
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:31,141
Scott: Yeah, we got the Ninja Turtles buttons.

214
00:12:31,162 --> 00:12:31,744
Scott: We're so cool.

215
00:12:31,965 --> 00:12:32,306
Scott: Anyway.

216
00:12:32,346 --> 00:12:32,607
Scott: Yeah.

217
00:12:32,828 --> 00:12:37,452
Scott: All right, so Okay, so we went to bed Thursday.

218
00:12:37,693 --> 00:12:53,867
Rym: one thing I'll note, you know, we hung around we went through this GameStop because I had not pre-ordered Leighton and I needed something to do in the downtime and There is nothing sadder than seeing the people who work at the GameStop Next to packs who have to work at the GameStop during packs.

219
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:54,609
Scott: I know right?

220
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:54,770
Scott: what?

221
00:12:55,773 --> 00:13:01,601
Scott: To work for the entirety of packs, you know Cuz they only have to work eight hours and packs goes late so they could have gone to concerts But still I got a hit.

222
00:13:01,621 --> 00:13:02,390
Scott: that sucks ass.

223
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,558
Rym: You work at GameStop and you live near packs.

224
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:09,804
Rym: make call your sick day in for next year now So but everyone else already called the sick day in.

225
00:13:09,925 --> 00:13:10,790
Rym: you don't know the dates yet.

226
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:11,252
Rym: I don't think.

227
00:13:11,473 --> 00:13:14,749
Scott: as soon as they announce the dates be like just those are the dates you quit the game stuff.

228
00:13:17,012 --> 00:13:20,122
Scott: Anyway, oh, oh we ate dinner that was totally awesome at this.

229
00:13:20,523 --> 00:13:22,470
Scott: basically it was a buffet and it was expensive.

230
00:13:22,671 --> 00:13:27,509
Scott: It was like $25 all you can eat, but it was all you could eat sushi's and awesomeness.

231
00:13:28,032 --> 00:13:31,265
Scott: So Scott Johnson's dad would have been very happy with infinite crab.

232
00:13:31,285 --> 00:13:32,330
Rym: There's this one packs guy.

233
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:39,224
Rym: He was definitely a packs guy and he walks up and he literally just fills a plate over a foot high with crab legs And then he goes back to his table.

234
00:13:39,264 --> 00:13:41,111
Scott: you'd grab 83.

235
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:44,686
Rym: all right enough about us and our personal BS before packs.

236
00:13:44,706 --> 00:13:45,570
Rym: We're talking about packs.

237
00:13:45,971 --> 00:13:50,590
Rym: So Friday morning we had you know, we're speakers in this year's speakers got a special privilege.

238
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:55,524
Rym: We got to walk into the expo room an hour and a half before the mobs got in.

239
00:13:56,206 --> 00:14:04,132
Rym: that that alone practically made my packs because I was able to do everything I wanted to do except play left for dead or Starcraft 2 because They're it.

240
00:14:04,152 --> 00:14:16,150
Rym: despite the early entry and these small number of people There were lines for both of those that I was not when I couldn't play Diablo 3 Starcraft 2 or left 4 dead 2 because it was basically early entry for media people and speakers.

241
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:17,358
Scott: so we got into this room.

242
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:31,566
Scott: we had 90 minutes to see this room and All the media people were doing all that and we couldn't so and not that I you know thing is any of those games I'm probably you know either not either gonna buy like left 4 dead 2 no matter what

243
00:14:32,409 --> 00:14:32,469
Rym: or

244
00:14:33,192 --> 00:14:35,701
Scott: Probably not gonna like the Blizzard games, so

245
00:14:35,922 --> 00:14:40,880
Rym: what amazed me was that for so few people in the room I would had to wait like 15 minutes to play left 4 dead.

246
00:14:41,282 --> 00:14:44,595
Scott: I know actually I was considering buying Diablo 3 Even though it's a click fest.

247
00:14:44,876 --> 00:14:45,981
Scott: I don't know why though why?

248
00:14:46,001 --> 00:14:47,849
Rym: I don't know I can click faster than you.

249
00:14:48,553 --> 00:14:50,021
Scott: I just wanted to check it out anyway.

250
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:54,566
Scott: the so yeah We saw a ton of awesome shit in this room.

251
00:14:54,847 --> 00:14:59,370
Rym: first off You know the biggest thing that stood out was the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles turtle van.

252
00:14:59,912 --> 00:15:02,422
Rym: It is like a personal Ninja Turtles turtle van.

253
00:15:02,503 --> 00:15:03,507
Scott: it actually drives.

254
00:15:03,547 --> 00:15:04,210
Scott: They drove it there.

255
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,950
Rym: Yeah, we talked to the guys who were running it.

256
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:12,897
Rym: They couldn't answer many questions, and we seem to ask all these weird questions that caught them off guard But they're like uh yet drives.

257
00:15:13,358 --> 00:15:14,761
Rym: I guess we drove it here.

258
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:17,208
Scott: Yeah, it was full of all sorts of Ninja Turtles.

259
00:15:17,669 --> 00:15:20,474
Scott: you know Memorabilia's and merchandise is.

260
00:15:20,494 --> 00:15:25,690
Rym: they had like a signed cell and like all the original toys some old like pewter miniatures of the turtles.

261
00:15:25,811 --> 00:15:27,749
Rym: I don't know if those were direct or bootleg or what.

262
00:15:27,809 --> 00:15:29,420
Scott: no I think those are front for like.

263
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,245
Scott: they were video game.

264
00:15:30,325 --> 00:15:32,837
Scott: They were a Tabletop miniature related weren't they?

265
00:15:32,917 --> 00:15:33,419
Rym: well they were.

266
00:15:33,439 --> 00:15:34,323
Scott: they were like reaper minis.

267
00:15:34,363 --> 00:15:35,608
Rym: right they were but they died.

268
00:15:35,648 --> 00:15:36,030
Rym: they didn't.

269
00:15:36,612 --> 00:15:37,316
Rym: I wasn't sure.

270
00:15:37,356 --> 00:15:42,382
Rym: it looks like they may or may not have been at least initially Fully licensed because they're kind of blob.

271
00:15:42,422 --> 00:15:43,588
Rym: you couldn't even really tell what they were.

272
00:15:43,608 --> 00:15:45,335
Scott: well They were just poorly made.

273
00:15:45,395 --> 00:15:48,467
Scott: and back that you know they were based off of the comic book art and such.

274
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:52,584
Scott: and anyway Yeah, awesome Ninja Turtles action going on over in the new turtles van.

275
00:15:52,624 --> 00:15:54,070
Scott: I think they were promoting a new turtles game.

276
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:57,829
Scott: I don't even know Ninja Turtles were awesome and that they had a van.

277
00:15:58,372 --> 00:16:01,566
Rym: But behind that you know walking further in what stood out more than anything.

278
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:02,470
Rym: and we talked to this guy.

279
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:08,010
Rym: We used up like half of our time in this early like check out just talking to this guy.

280
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:15,867
Scott: There's this company geek chic, and they basically make Heirloom guys like with a you know with a camel the other kind of chic.

281
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:20,004
Rym: Yes Yes, they make heirloom quality geek furniture like you're a gamer.

282
00:16:20,386 --> 00:16:26,100
Rym: They make like an $11,000 custom like Tables a lot cheaper than $11,000.

283
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,872
Rym: Yeah, I didn't say they didn't know okay But they like.

284
00:16:28,892 --> 00:16:32,365
Rym: they make these amazing custom for you gamer tables like.

285
00:16:32,746 --> 00:16:34,457
Rym: basically you talk to them And you say things like.

286
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:35,870
Rym: you know I am this kind of gamer.

287
00:16:36,232 --> 00:16:43,482
Rym: These are the things I would like a table to be able to do to accommodate my gaming And they'll make it for you, and this is some high quality stuff.

288
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,406
Rym: They're not carpenters.

289
00:16:44,426 --> 00:16:45,410
Rym: They're cabinet makers.

290
00:16:45,511 --> 00:16:46,792
Scott: Yeah, I learned that that was very good They.

291
00:16:46,812 --> 00:16:50,278
Scott: I learned a lot of stuff from these guys But you know the best thing about this right?

292
00:16:50,298 --> 00:17:01,837
Scott: how many times you go online and you see like someone made a gaming table And it's got secret message compartments Or it's got little drawers or it's got a little place like the DM to put his screen Or it's got like a piece of plastic.

293
00:17:01,858 --> 00:17:04,709
Scott: you can move the minis around you know and put the maps under it.

294
00:17:05,211 --> 00:17:10,347
Scott: Basically these guys they had it all and it's basically for reals.

295
00:17:10,387 --> 00:17:25,230
Scott: get your gaming table Not some shoddy thing made by you and your you know garage And the prices are very reasonable and the From what I could tell the amount of service they provide and the quality level were extremely high And like they had a table you could get for like less than $2,000.

296
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:28,905
Scott: It was crazy and like goddamn a dining room table usually cost more than that.

297
00:17:28,926 --> 00:17:33,947
Scott: so never dining room table That is more than just a table cost about the same as dining room table.

298
00:17:33,967 --> 00:17:36,772
Rym: fuck Yeah, you got to check out the pictures I uploaded one.

299
00:17:36,832 --> 00:17:43,734
Rym: this guy was really dapper Robert Gifford the guy the degree his title that he gave himself for the company is Instigator.

300
00:17:43,754 --> 00:17:49,079
Rym: nah excellent Robert Gifford was very dapper Lee dressed And he gave a like the.

301
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:53,829
Rym: it wasn't really a sales pitch because we were just talking to him And we're going to interview him soonish.

302
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:57,043
Scott: Yes, we won't go too long about but these tables fucking amazing.

303
00:17:57,063 --> 00:17:58,750
Scott: gonna get one as soon as I have a place to put one.

304
00:17:58,991 --> 00:17:59,232
Rym: I just.

305
00:17:59,252 --> 00:18:01,622
Rym: I have so such a vision of the table.

306
00:18:01,742 --> 00:18:03,590
Rym: I want and I'm willing to pay almost anything for it.

307
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:06,950
Rym: I mean that like the glass over it like underneath you can.

308
00:18:07,993 --> 00:18:10,281
Scott: So you got these eat leaves right.

309
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,525
Scott: so it's a dining room table.

310
00:18:11,786 --> 00:18:15,863
Scott: if you flip the leaves over It's felt surface, so it's like I. you can play some nice games on there.

311
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,975
Scott: if you remove the leaves now You have a pit.

312
00:18:18,277 --> 00:18:20,150
Scott: at the bottom of the pit is a whiteboard.

313
00:18:20,491 --> 00:18:30,490
Scott: Then if you don't want to use the whiteboard you can put some pieces of paper maps over the whiteboard and then a piece of Plastic on top of that to hold the maps down and play like battle tech or your war hammer.

314
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:31,841
Scott: It's all whatever salted.

315
00:18:31,882 --> 00:18:42,516
Rym: all the tables have cool names But the Sultan line of this one is basically the maximum table They had like this system where every every spot where a player would sit you can fold down the top to your own Personal little cubicle.

316
00:18:42,556 --> 00:18:42,958
Rym: basically.

317
00:18:42,978 --> 00:18:48,981
Scott: so you have like a screen built in and you have like three card Filing drawers and and the game master set up.

318
00:18:49,001 --> 00:18:51,310
Scott: there are dice pits with like rubber bumpers in them.

319
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,436
Rym: It's not a GM screen.

320
00:18:52,476 --> 00:18:55,149
Rym: It's like a GM module that slides out and opens up.

321
00:18:56,113 --> 00:18:57,369
Rym: These tables were so cool.

322
00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:06,183
Scott: The only thing is with these tables basically I kind of actually it'd be great if we got the table because it would force us To play RPGs that had five or fewer players in a GM.

323
00:19:06,565 --> 00:19:07,930
Scott: You couldn't play a bigger game with it.

324
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:08,472
Rym: Yeah, you can't.

325
00:19:08,492 --> 00:19:13,070
Rym: the maximum Sultan they had listed was a seven player plus GM table seven players.

326
00:19:13,393 --> 00:19:14,567
Scott: We have stuff more than that though.

327
00:19:15,831 --> 00:19:20,705
Scott: Anyway, well for our one game right exactly all right, so geek tables up.

328
00:19:20,805 --> 00:19:26,570
Scott: so then over next the geek tables There's this company steel series with mice and keyboards and that sort of stuff.

329
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:35,310
Scott: And I was like you know usually you'd look at those companies like razor or whatever who make like the gaming peripherals And you're like oh, whatever you know that's kind of silly.

330
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:35,912
Scott: I mean last year.

331
00:19:35,932 --> 00:19:37,759
Scott: remember the gun mouse that some company had.

332
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:42,057
Rym: the thing is all these things are usually cool But not worth the money exactly.

333
00:19:42,077 --> 00:19:44,026
Rym: that gun mouse was surprising.

334
00:19:44,086 --> 00:19:44,930
Rym: like we thought it was stupid.

335
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:49,050
Rym: We scoffed at him, then I tried it playing some counter-strike, and hey this is actually pretty good.

336
00:19:49,691 --> 00:19:50,093
Scott: So I went.

337
00:19:50,133 --> 00:19:55,779
Scott: so you checked out what steel series had just sort of while I was standing there And actually what they had was pretty great.

338
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,867
Scott: I mean they had this mouse called.

339
00:19:57,887 --> 00:20:00,556
Scott: I think it was the Forget the name of it.

340
00:20:01,078 --> 00:20:01,541
Rym: regardless.

341
00:20:01,561 --> 00:20:03,290
Rym: what Scott pointed out is that this mouse?

342
00:20:03,813 --> 00:20:06,910
Rym: Was designed with me in mind because Scott doesn't care as much about this sort of thing.

343
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:07,595
Rym: But I am like.

344
00:20:07,655 --> 00:20:14,135
Rym: so like I'm so picky about my mouse And I will diddle with the tiniest adjustments to the sensitivity This mouse.

345
00:20:14,536 --> 00:20:17,167
Rym: you save the sensitivity settings in the mouse.

346
00:20:17,267 --> 00:20:20,983
Scott: you can also Like set like different key bindings in the mouse.

347
00:20:21,023 --> 00:20:22,650
Scott: you can make those buttons on the side.

348
00:20:22,912 --> 00:20:27,120
Scott: You could set like the button on the side to be Semicolon or three or whatever.

349
00:20:27,181 --> 00:20:29,210
Scott: just all the settings are in the mouse itself.

350
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:32,565
Scott: So you don't need any special drivers or software to set the mouse up.

351
00:20:32,886 --> 00:20:33,690
Scott: you just spin week.

352
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:40,250
Scott: There's an LCD screen on the bottom of the mouse And you can spin the mouse wheel and push the buttons on the mouse to change the settings.

353
00:20:40,631 --> 00:20:45,229
Rym: It's totally crazy, so he showed me you can change the sensitivity down to a single individual CPI.

354
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:52,470
Scott: It was I got to get plus and then you can set the polling rate exactly equal to your vertical refresh of your monitor.

355
00:20:53,373 --> 00:21:00,218
Scott: That that's a really good at 70 like yeah 75 Hertz monitor 75 Hertz mouse plus the coolest thing You know it doesn't have a hump.

356
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:02,070
Rym: It's a normal sized and shaped.

357
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:05,090
Scott: Yeah, it's like a lot of the gaming mice like especially the razor ones.

358
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:05,933
Scott: They look all weird.

359
00:21:06,315 --> 00:21:09,910
Scott: this mouse just a totally normal looking mouse the thing I like most about it.

360
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:12,381
Scott: You know as I mean those settings were cool, but I don't really need them.

361
00:21:12,823 --> 00:21:15,310
Scott: well first of all the mouse is reasonably priced Like only 90 bucks.

362
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:20,544
Scott: I think right was that the mouse was just so smooth on the mousepad like did the.

363
00:21:20,965 --> 00:21:23,453
Scott: the level of friction was just oh So luxurious.

364
00:21:23,493 --> 00:21:29,870
Scott: I think I might buy the mousepad even though the mousepad was and he is a ludicrous $35 for that particular mousepad.

365
00:21:30,511 --> 00:21:34,070
Scott: That's something I'm gonna use every single day of my life for a long long period of time.

366
00:21:34,131 --> 00:21:40,088
Scott: I think it's worth the $35 for that good feeling in my hands much in the same vein as the air on chairs we bought.

367
00:21:40,108 --> 00:21:40,650
Rym: it's just I got.

368
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,343
Rym: Well, I got an error as I value freedom.

369
00:21:43,645 --> 00:21:44,388
Rym: I value air.

370
00:21:46,391 --> 00:21:48,996
Scott: Anyway What else was awesome in there?

371
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,922
Rym: I forget what game they were promoting it.

372
00:21:51,203 --> 00:21:54,457
Rym: sadly their promotion must not work that well I didn't pay attention to what it was.

373
00:21:54,477 --> 00:22:07,470
Rym: there was this gigantic, and I mean Some sort of like action RPG walk around hit things with the sword game Pneumatic horse and supposedly the guy who was running it and who made it was like he did this for Jurassic Park.

374
00:22:07,731 --> 00:22:11,408
Rym: Yeah, he was one of those animatronic types, and this thing I've been on like bar.

375
00:22:11,951 --> 00:22:13,539
Rym: you know stay on the rocking bull before.

376
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:18,436
Rym: this was that times a thousand and Basically, I'm looking at it I was like can I ride it?

377
00:22:18,576 --> 00:22:19,981
Rym: and he's like that guy's about to ride it.

378
00:22:20,021 --> 00:22:20,885
Rym: just sign this waiver.

379
00:22:21,005 --> 00:22:26,625
Scott: the waiver was basically waiver Was like riding mechanical horses is an extreme sport.

380
00:22:26,826 --> 00:22:27,689
Rym: you may die.

381
00:22:28,634 --> 00:22:31,150
Scott: Of course the thing wasn't surrounded by like inflatable.

382
00:22:31,535 --> 00:22:32,669
Scott: You know big like back.

383
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:33,855
Scott: It was necessary.

384
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:39,801
Rym: the thing is it's funny because you couldn't eat like you had to be pretty Skilled even to get on that thing because there's no like stirrup.

385
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:42,090
Scott: a fat guy went before him and had a trouble getting on.

386
00:22:42,676 --> 00:22:47,730
Rym: Yep, but when I got there I basically had to like jump and then bounce and then like haul myself up.

387
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:50,460
Scott: But I would have gotten on from the back cowboy style.

388
00:22:50,862 --> 00:22:53,030
Rym: I held on for 30 seconds.

389
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:54,355
Rym: I'm very proud of myself.

390
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:55,922
Scott: that guy got two guys before.

391
00:22:55,962 --> 00:22:56,705
Scott: you was like a pro.

392
00:22:56,765 --> 00:22:57,790
Scott: He stayed on for a long time.

393
00:22:58,131 --> 00:22:59,376
Rym: Yeah, the thing is this thing.

394
00:23:00,018 --> 00:23:06,100
Rym: it threw me off with an amount of force that was unexpected Shall we say so I get thrown off.

395
00:23:06,381 --> 00:23:06,964
Rym: I'm laying there.

396
00:23:07,024 --> 00:23:13,170
Rym: I throw up the horns like yeah And then the guy controlling it has the horse look at me because I'm still laying there.

397
00:23:13,572 --> 00:23:17,299
Scott: It was like a demonic horse too with like glowing eyes And they had like a smoke machine.

398
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:20,794
Scott: so smoke is coming out from under it You know as a horse from hell Right

399
00:23:21,036 --> 00:23:29,070
Rym: and the horse comes and looks at me in the crowd like oh And I look up and I see the horse looking at me and then a second later right in the mean bean machine.

400
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:29,753
Rym: Yeah, imagine.

401
00:23:29,773 --> 00:23:34,109
Scott: It's like imagine the mechanical bull strikes back like you're like you already threw you off and out head butts you.

402
00:23:36,232 --> 00:23:37,196
Scott: The thing is I was stupid.

403
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:40,389
Scott: I just stopped playing the video as soon as Rym fell off so I didn't catch that part.

404
00:23:40,409 --> 00:23:44,104
Scott: I Gotta learn for now on whenever I video something video over.

405
00:23:44,124 --> 00:23:45,028
Scott: That's my lesson.

406
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:45,370
Scott: I learned.

407
00:23:51,871 --> 00:23:58,390
Rym: So speaking of that things of the day my thing of the day is the video Scott took of me riding the horse.

408
00:23:59,091 --> 00:24:02,630
Rym: I'm still sad you didn't get the shot of the horse getting me in the mean bean machine.

409
00:24:02,831 --> 00:24:04,538
Scott: Yeah, my I hope this.

410
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:07,630
Scott: I haven't uploaded the video yet, so this might be a fail thing of the day.

411
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:07,972
Scott: We'll see.

412
00:24:08,012 --> 00:24:08,957
Scott: I'm pretty sure it'll work though.

413
00:24:08,977 --> 00:24:09,480
Rym: Just worst case.

414
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,486
Rym: We'll get it up like tomorrow.

415
00:24:10,546 --> 00:24:11,190
Scott: Yeah, I'll get it up.

416
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:13,160
Scott: Don't worry my thing today is something.

417
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,990
Scott: I'll talk about later in this episode.

418
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:19,303
Scott: Basically there was some awesome case modding action and the bet the winner.

419
00:24:19,364 --> 00:24:23,557
Scott: the best case modder was this guy from NFC Systems so his website is my thing of the day.

420
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:25,142
Rym: That was pretty cool.

421
00:24:25,423 --> 00:24:26,627
Rym: Oh, yeah, all right.

422
00:24:26,667 --> 00:24:27,835
Rym: so back to the expo Hall.

423
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:31,939
Scott: I played Miles Edgeworth investigations for like 30 seconds.

424
00:24:31,959 --> 00:24:35,030
Rym: you basically hit the stylus against the screen a couple times and walked away.

425
00:24:35,231 --> 00:24:40,433
Scott: Yeah, I just checked and to see what kind of thing it was and it was freaking Edgeworth investigations I didn't.

426
00:24:40,453 --> 00:24:40,674
Scott: you know.

427
00:24:40,694 --> 00:24:43,390
Scott: I'm gonna play it for reals and buy it so what do I need to play it there?

428
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:46,984
Rym: We played Super Mario Brothers week, which was about.

429
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:48,290
Rym: it was exactly what I expected.

430
00:24:48,371 --> 00:24:49,842
Rym: It was as fun as I expected the can.

431
00:24:50,084 --> 00:24:52,895
Scott: the only complaint Controls are a little not smooth.

432
00:24:52,976 --> 00:24:54,801
Rym: the control more and more Nintendo.

433
00:24:54,841 --> 00:24:58,250
Rym: like all the Mario games the controls are a little more loose.

434
00:24:58,732 --> 00:24:59,516
Rym: Then you know they.

435
00:24:59,536 --> 00:25:02,270
Scott: basically I want the controls to be tight like Mario 3 or Mario.

436
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:02,973
Rym: That's what I was about to say.

437
00:25:03,013 --> 00:25:07,130
Rym: ever since Mario 3 every game after that has been slightly more loose.

438
00:25:07,571 --> 00:25:15,177
Rym: Yeah, Mario 3 was perhaps the most precisely controlled Mario game ever made and then Mario Super Mario world was only slightly less Precisely controlled.

439
00:25:15,297 --> 00:25:17,670
Rym: this game was real loose, but otherwise it's super fun.

440
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:18,396
Rym: We're just gonna buy it.

441
00:25:18,437 --> 00:25:19,850
Rym: I don't need to review it any further than that.

442
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:22,399
Rym: It's exactly what it looks like Tatsunoko vs.

443
00:25:22,419 --> 00:25:22,900
Scott: Capcom.

444
00:25:23,041 --> 00:25:23,623
Scott: I looked at it.

445
00:25:23,884 --> 00:25:24,766
Scott: It was Tatsunoko vs.

446
00:25:24,787 --> 00:25:25,248
Scott: Capcom.

447
00:25:25,529 --> 00:25:28,725
Rym: Yep We saw Suro that game.

448
00:25:28,886 --> 00:25:32,150
Scott: we talked about Episode about Suro and we said it was out of print.

449
00:25:32,331 --> 00:25:33,036
Rym: It's back in print.

450
00:25:33,057 --> 00:25:34,850
Rym: the company picked it up so you can just go buy it.

451
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:36,321
Rym: They had a whole thing a display about it.

452
00:25:36,341 --> 00:25:36,764
Scott: I don't buy it yet.

453
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:40,490
Scott: They were selling it there, but they said the release date was coming soon.

454
00:25:40,951 --> 00:25:41,333
Rym: I think they.

455
00:25:41,353 --> 00:25:45,870
Rym: I don't know if they were selling overstock from before or if they're selling reprints or what but it's bad.

456
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:46,916
Scott: Did we add the business card?

457
00:25:46,936 --> 00:25:48,102
Scott: I forget what the company was.

458
00:25:48,143 --> 00:25:48,485
Scott: I feel bad.

459
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:49,430
Rym: I got it laying in my pile.

460
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:53,066
Rym: I've only gone through the pile of people that I have to email back in a timely manner.

461
00:25:53,307 --> 00:25:55,436
Scott: Yeah, we'll make In the.

462
00:25:55,517 --> 00:25:57,290
Scott: we'll put a bunch of show notes for this episode.

463
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:00,765
Rym: Basically Scott played Forza 3 and then I played Forza 3.

464
00:26:00,765 --> 00:26:02,030
Scott: Was that actually Forza 3?

465
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:03,275
Scott: I'm not sure which Forza it was.

466
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:04,057
Rym: Pretty sure it was 3.

467
00:26:04,057 --> 00:26:09,558
Scott: It had 3 screens and a steering wheel and a surround sound And a seat and pedals and the whole thing.

468
00:26:09,618 --> 00:26:14,450
Rym: It was basically the maximum setup for that game, which it's cool You know, we talked to the guy who was running the thing.

469
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:24,389
Rym: He basically pointed out that with the Forza series they have this feature that if you're hardcore and you have three Xboxes Three copies of the game and three screens you can do this three screen thing.

470
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:28,021
Rym: But they basically it's not designed to sell the game.

471
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:30,229
Rym: He admitted that no one buys that game because it hasn't.

472
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:39,010
Rym: They only do it as a gift to the fans of their series of racing games Mmm, because they know that a lot of their fans will go hardcore and make like rigs with three Xboxes.

473
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:41,210
Scott: And the thing is I played it with the three screens.

474
00:26:41,431 --> 00:26:46,290
Scott: I realized after getting off and watching Rym play that I never looked at the left or right screen ever.

475
00:26:46,792 --> 00:26:50,709
Scott: Right and two there was a rear-view mirror on the right screen that I never looked at.

476
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:55,532
Scott: Yeah, but once I looked at it while Rym was playing it was a damn good-looking rear-view mirror Let me tell you.

477
00:26:56,154 --> 00:27:00,649
Scott: but yet Forza 3 if you like realistic racing games, that seems like a winner to me.

478
00:27:00,972 --> 00:27:02,450
Scott: Oh, so I'm not a big fan of them.

479
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:10,510
Rym: So at the Activision arcade racers at the Activision booth And I'm pretty sure I didn't see anyone talking about them remaking these this might be one of the originals from back in the day.

480
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:11,714
Scott: That wasn't the Activision booth.

481
00:27:11,754 --> 00:27:13,561
Scott: It was the retro merch booth.

482
00:27:13,802 --> 00:27:16,050
Rym: I it to me in my life is the Activision booth?

483
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:29,437
Rym: Okay, because they had among the Atari 5200 and Commodore's for sale The Activision bucket brigade patch the one that if you took a picture of your screen with a high enough score from kaboom on the Atari And mailed it to them.

484
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,129
Rym: They would send you this badge.

485
00:27:31,779 --> 00:27:32,952
Scott: Yep, but yeah There's a booth.

486
00:27:33,012 --> 00:27:40,580
Scott: that's all that was at PAX last year and this year that sells all sorts of wicked retro shit Like holy shit retro stuff and it's for sale.

487
00:27:40,641 --> 00:27:42,488
Scott: It's not like yeah, we're just a little museum.

488
00:27:42,528 --> 00:27:43,150
Scott: It's like holy shit.

489
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:45,489
Scott: They're selling this crap and they got a lot of it.

490
00:27:45,912 --> 00:27:49,570
Scott: So I try not to spend too much time at that booth because I could be there all fucking day.

491
00:27:50,133 --> 00:27:52,549
Scott: But it's always good to just stop by it real quick.

492
00:27:52,891 --> 00:27:54,116
Scott: See like a few amazing things.

493
00:27:54,156 --> 00:27:54,758
Scott: that way it'll be.

494
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:59,519
Scott: that booth will be amazing year after year after year because I doubt they're gonna Get more retro shit, right?

495
00:28:00,122 --> 00:28:01,429
Scott: They sort of have all of it already.

496
00:28:02,631 --> 00:28:04,179
Rym: We very much wandered around everything else.

497
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:16,936
Scott: Oh, we played this an R-type co-op That's coming to the Xbox Right bringing you can push a button to switch it from 3d mode to retro mode graphics wise like Instantly all you want.

498
00:28:17,397 --> 00:28:22,124
Scott: and it was R-type and it was co-op and we me and Rym played it and we sucked ass But we had infinite lives.

499
00:28:22,165 --> 00:28:22,550
Rym: That's the thing.

500
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:28,090
Rym: It was hard as balls, but one of the co-op modes is how many lives does it take you which is super fun?

501
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,238
Scott: Yeah much more fun than you die.

502
00:28:30,338 --> 00:28:31,925
Scott: play the first level a million times.

503
00:28:31,985 --> 00:28:39,909
Rym: never play level 3 because That's the best way to get better is to be forced to play again, yep We played some of the packs 10 games.

504
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:43,659
Scott: Osmose was a one that I played the most time.

505
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,164
Rym: Osmose is my favorite.

506
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:47,090
Scott: I didn't play at the closure one.

507
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:48,635
Scott: I wanted to play that I didn't get to.

508
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:53,715
Scott: but yeah, we're gonna have to play those on our own time and You know.

509
00:28:53,796 --> 00:28:55,810
Scott: then maybe do another episode on them or something.

510
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:57,980
Scott: But you can go online and fight.

511
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,950
Scott: get the list of what the packs 10 games were.

512
00:29:01,332 --> 00:29:02,946
Scott: They were all looking pretty good to me.

513
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:06,089
Scott: Let's see anything else going on and out of the glove.

514
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:08,396
Rym: But oh, yeah This company use the gloves company.

515
00:29:08,416 --> 00:29:11,509
Rym: Peregrine had a glove and people there was a line to use it and I just didn't.

516
00:29:11,569 --> 00:29:12,092
Rym: I didn't Have time.

517
00:29:12,132 --> 00:29:14,930
Rym: we spent all our time talking to the geek cheek guy and riding that horse.

518
00:29:15,252 --> 00:29:20,310
Rym: Yeah, but I'm not sure what it was But it looked like it was working pretty well and people seem to be digging it.

519
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:23,550
Rym: But I have a feeling it's cool in the way that that gun mouse was cool.

520
00:29:23,671 --> 00:29:25,017
Rym: I don't know how applicable it is.

521
00:29:25,078 --> 00:29:27,370
Rym: So if anyone tried that out, let us know how it was.

522
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:29,458
Scott: Basically the what it looked like to me is you could.

523
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:42,490
Scott: yet you put on this glove that was sort of had like, you know a motion-capture rig kind of stuff, you know the same thing they use for that and You would bind different gestures physical hand gestures to different keys on the keyboard like they opened up.

524
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:45,553
Scott: I saw during a demo someone was doing Like.

525
00:29:45,573 --> 00:29:50,550
Scott: they opened up notepad and a guy was basically moving his fingers and all sorts of letters were appearing on the screen.

526
00:29:50,710 --> 00:30:00,429
Scott: So like you would go you would take this and you would go into a game and you would like bind like index finger You shoot and middle finger is jump or you know, whatever you are wave your hand back and forth, you know.

527
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:02,459
Scott: So I wonder how well it works.

528
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:04,770
Scott: I didn't get to use it myself, but it existed.

529
00:30:06,131 --> 00:30:08,640
Scott: And I noticed no one was trying to sell stupid VR goggles.

530
00:30:08,981 --> 00:30:09,182
Rym: Yep.

531
00:30:09,885 --> 00:30:13,099
Rym: We got to wait on it every year There's some VR goggle that's better.

532
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,989
Rym: But is there not at the point where they're great yet?

533
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:21,044
Scott: Yep, and I my guess would be that the glove is in the same sort of position But we had a little bit of time before our first panel.

534
00:30:21,064 --> 00:30:27,868
Rym: So we wandered around, you know Like the console freeplay the tabletop area the console freeplay was completely empty, you know kind of just started a

535
00:30:27,888 --> 00:30:29,455
Scott: brand new You know opening of the con

536
00:30:29,918 --> 00:30:35,030
Rym: and the cool enforcers were doing the same kind of thing We used to do when we ran like the Picasso con gaming area.

537
00:30:35,491 --> 00:30:36,997
Rym: They were just setting up random challenges.

538
00:30:37,037 --> 00:30:41,954
Rym: guy was like if you can beat quick man's level and get to quick man Don't even have to beat quick man.

539
00:30:42,135 --> 00:30:43,500
Rym: You win Scott.

540
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,082
Scott: I was dying.

541
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:46,350
Rym: Scott was unable to get to quick man.

542
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,220
Scott: You know that I can do it right?

543
00:30:48,301 --> 00:30:52,949
Rym: Of course, we stumped him when we pointed out Hey, can I go to flash man's level first beat him?

544
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:57,170
Scott: And then the thing is you try to beat flash man without dying without any weapons.

545
00:30:57,772 --> 00:31:04,658
Rym: Well, what you do is you beat everyone in the order to get to quick man and then you beat quick man's level Right with flash man exactly.

546
00:31:05,059 --> 00:31:07,430
Rym: actually flash man is pretty easy to beat with the standard gun.

547
00:31:07,831 --> 00:31:08,534
Scott: Yep, he is.

548
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:11,990
Scott: but the problem is you got to get to him and then beat him without dying.

549
00:31:12,131 --> 00:31:20,049
Scott: I mean usually what will happen if you try to beat flash man right away is you can beat him right away But you'll die at him and then beat him with your next life.

550
00:31:20,631 --> 00:31:27,853
Scott: So to do it without dying is something special especially on difficult mode as opposed to well real regular mode as opposed to easy mode Right.

551
00:31:28,296 --> 00:31:33,442
Scott: Yeah, it was basically get to quick man Which means the only real dangerous stuff is the lasers that instantly kill you.

552
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:35,430
Scott: and you know, I can do it.

553
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:38,622
Scott: I'm the Mega Man 2 guy, but I didn't concentrate very much.

554
00:31:38,642 --> 00:31:39,505
Scott: We're chatting it up.

555
00:31:40,007 --> 00:31:40,910
Scott: I had to go to a panel.

556
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:42,498
Scott: I took two tries at it.

557
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,684
Scott: I got pretty close.

558
00:31:43,926 --> 00:31:44,489
Scott: I didn't make it.

559
00:31:44,931 --> 00:31:46,945
Scott: I probably could have done if I went back later, but I could do it.

560
00:31:46,985 --> 00:31:49,809
Scott: I just don't want to Want me to do it after?

561
00:31:51,031 --> 00:31:52,818
Scott: You know the show I don't know.

562
00:31:52,838 --> 00:31:53,280
Rym: we'll save it.

563
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,987
Rym: We'll do some event with quick man.

564
00:31:55,027 --> 00:31:56,775
Scott: Maybe in the future I could definitely do it.

565
00:31:56,795 --> 00:31:59,890
Rym: There's no question about but this was all just lead up.

566
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:01,255
Rym: You know extra time before.

567
00:32:01,275 --> 00:32:05,730
Rym: you know, our first panel beyond Candyland in the Raven theater Friday morning.

568
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:18,993
Rym: So we got there early and the bonus round was there before us and we actually Because the bonus round wanted to film some bonus round in the con with their backdrop before you know They left the room.

569
00:32:19,515 --> 00:32:22,507
Rym: They basically made our panel beyond Candyland 15 minutes late.

570
00:32:22,929 --> 00:32:27,810
Scott: Yep That's alright because our panel was full and it was great as awesome panel.

571
00:32:28,011 --> 00:32:31,495
Rym: I was so amazed when we get to the room and we see you know They're like the route.

572
00:32:31,515 --> 00:32:37,790
Rym: there are a lot of people in the in the bonus round thing But there are a lot of people lined up way early to see beyond Candyland.

573
00:32:38,172 --> 00:32:44,830
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know there wasn't much else going on at the con at the time and you know Our panel was had a good name people like board games.

574
00:32:45,231 --> 00:32:51,110
Scott: I noticed that even though there was a lot of tabletop action going at the con a big watsy presence big tabletop area.

575
00:32:51,573 --> 00:32:54,469
Scott: You know all the tabletop tables are busy constantly full the whole con.

576
00:32:55,411 --> 00:33:02,404
Scott: There wasn't that much tabletop panel action, you know Relatively speaking to the amount of tabletop gaming that there was.

577
00:33:02,926 --> 00:33:07,609
Scott: so, you know The fact that we were one of the few tabletop panels with beyond Candyland, I think helped us out.

578
00:33:08,092 --> 00:33:08,696
Rym: One cool thing though.

579
00:33:08,716 --> 00:33:14,410
Rym: We finally, you know, and guy crow was on our plane So we actually we talked to him because he was on this panel and we're all hanging out.

580
00:33:14,731 --> 00:33:16,638
Scott: He was on the you know, the bonus round.

581
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:19,770
Scott: So when the bonus round was leaving, we're like, hey you ain't guy crow.

582
00:33:19,911 --> 00:33:20,977
Scott: Yeah, I saw you on the plane.

583
00:33:21,178 --> 00:33:21,682
Scott: What's up?

584
00:33:21,903 --> 00:33:22,949
Scott: Yeah, that was it.

585
00:33:23,131 --> 00:33:32,844
Rym: The funny thing was though that they you know quiet in the room they filmed the what the the segment for bonus round with the backdrop of bonus round and It took me back to us trying to do stage things.

586
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:38,130
Rym: as opposed to the kind of live GeekNights We do where they do like ten takes and keep the guy to do three takes.

587
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:41,247
Scott: He flubbed it, you know, and it was like, oh everyone does that.

588
00:33:41,508 --> 00:33:49,130
Scott: Okay Even the semi this real professional guy flubs it so we're all good, but the panel went crazy.

589
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:52,140
Rym: Well, like people freaking loved it people loved it so much.

590
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,789
Scott: They came to our other panels because our first was great.

591
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:57,336
Rym: You know the first panel, you know We're like who here knows who we are.

592
00:33:57,396 --> 00:33:58,702
Rym: and like four people raise their hands.

593
00:33:59,104 --> 00:34:00,250
Rym: our second panel on Saturday.

594
00:34:00,612 --> 00:34:04,590
Rym: Who here came here because they saw our other panel and like half the room raised their hands.

595
00:34:04,944 --> 00:34:13,741
Rym: Yep and beyond D&D as far as I can tell was like 75% people who came because of our other panels and 25% people who missed beyond D&D attacks last year.

596
00:34:13,841 --> 00:34:14,022
Rym: Yep.

597
00:34:14,402 --> 00:34:14,965
Scott: That's very good.

598
00:34:15,648 --> 00:34:16,330
Rym: It was great.

599
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:24,809
Scott: I mean it would have been better though to have completely different people fill up the room three times because then we get the widest Coverage but then that also means our first panel sucked and no one wanted to come back.

600
00:34:25,091 --> 00:34:33,043
Rym: But I will call beyond candy land a huge success because for the entire rest of the con Like numerous times like every time we're in a panel room.

601
00:34:33,083 --> 00:34:34,429
Rym: We are in a tabletop gaming room.

602
00:34:34,451 --> 00:34:49,197
Rym: Sorry We'd see people playing like learning how to play like settlers or Puerto Rico or teeny or curricular or something and almost every time They were people who weren't really tabletop gamers who went to the panel and then because of us played one of the games We recommended at PAX.

603
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,090
Rym: Yep, that made me so happy.

604
00:34:51,531 --> 00:34:55,625
Scott: In fact during our beyond candy land right this guy from joystick was in the audience.

605
00:34:56,308 --> 00:34:57,030
Rym: Oh, yeah, Kevin.

606
00:34:57,231 --> 00:34:58,357
Rym: Yeah, Kevin was pretty cool.

607
00:34:58,397 --> 00:35:04,560
Rym: And the saddest thing was he gave me the business card and we're like, hey Let's do something cuz joysticks trying to do this this segment.

608
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,970
Scott: Apparently joystick has some column that's like about tabletop games.

609
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:09,759
Scott: So he's like, hey, I'll interview you for this column.

610
00:35:09,779 --> 00:35:12,010
Rym: We're like, okay sure whatever and Kevin's pretty cool.

611
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:18,110
Rym: The problem was he was busy and we were busy and basically the entire rest of packs was hey you want to do this thing?

612
00:35:18,512 --> 00:35:19,337
Rym: No, I gotta do this.

613
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:20,221
Rym: Hey, you ready now?

614
00:35:20,362 --> 00:35:21,810
Rym: Oh, no, I gotta do this back and forth.

615
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:23,316
Rym: It's basically neither.

616
00:35:23,396 --> 00:35:26,147
Rym: we were never both free at the same time for the entirety of the con.

617
00:35:26,268 --> 00:35:26,709
Scott: That's all right.

618
00:35:27,071 --> 00:35:30,644
Scott: But basically he he bought Puerto Rico because we said it was so awesome.

619
00:35:30,905 --> 00:35:32,110
Scott: So that was that was pretty cool.

620
00:35:32,371 --> 00:35:34,162
Rym: Yep, so we'll let you know what comes of that.

621
00:35:34,182 --> 00:35:36,723
Rym: We're gonna try to do the phone interview Maybe tomorrow.

622
00:35:36,763 --> 00:35:41,787
Scott: sometime this week We also met up with him at dinner on Sunday and he gave us a copy of risk.

623
00:35:41,928 --> 00:35:44,245
Scott: Halo Wars We'll see about that risk.

624
00:35:44,286 --> 00:35:45,792
Rym: Halo Wars The.

625
00:35:45,932 --> 00:35:51,070
Rym: you look at the box and all I could think was this looks like a joke from something awful Photoshop contest.

626
00:35:51,331 --> 00:35:53,778
Scott: Oh my god, it's so true, but it isn't.

627
00:35:53,978 --> 00:35:55,302
Rym: it is so dead serious.

628
00:35:55,382 --> 00:35:56,385
Rym: It's an actual game.

629
00:35:56,405 --> 00:35:57,148
Rym: It's real.

630
00:35:57,248 --> 00:35:57,669
Rym: I have it.

631
00:35:59,151 --> 00:35:59,833
Rym: We're gonna play it.

632
00:35:59,853 --> 00:36:00,575
Rym: We're gonna review it.

633
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:01,438
Rym: We have to.

634
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:03,504
Scott: so, you know, we the one.

635
00:36:03,524 --> 00:36:04,486
Scott: the thing is right.

636
00:36:04,547 --> 00:36:05,710
Scott: we scheduled our panels.

637
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:08,383
Scott: We told them we don't want to miss any of the concerts.

638
00:36:08,463 --> 00:36:09,750
Scott: We don't want to miss the keynote.

639
00:36:09,992 --> 00:36:11,670
Scott: We don't want to miss the mega strip panel.

640
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:14,843
Rym: We don't want to miss right and amber and everyone we worked with.

641
00:36:14,924 --> 00:36:18,289
Rym: setting these panels up was super cool And they basically were like, yeah, whatever you want.

642
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:26,009
Scott: So we had to run from beyond candy land to the keynote and we get to the keynote and they're like well We can't promise you'll get in and we're like fuck.

643
00:36:26,632 --> 00:36:33,876
Rym: Ah, so I have my speaker back and I'm planning like if I don't get in I'm going to pull rank something I never want to do it packs.

644
00:36:34,237 --> 00:36:38,466
Rym: I'll do that like anime cons, but I would never want to be that guy Who's like, you know who I am?

645
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:44,914
Rym: Let me in right but I was preparing like what I was going to do to get into the keynote No matter what.

646
00:36:45,417 --> 00:36:50,256
Scott: so we get at the end of the line and realize like We're like, let's get in line.

647
00:36:50,296 --> 00:36:51,080
Rym: Anyway, what do we?

648
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,990
Scott: what else we gonna do expecting line to get cut off?

649
00:36:53,271 --> 00:36:58,110
Rym: The funny thing was we met all these punk kids in line who saw like our panel and then had gone to the line.

650
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:04,308
Rym: We had to do stuff before we went and they were like, wow you guys have to stand in line, too Like yeah, yeah.

651
00:37:05,897 --> 00:37:08,754
Scott: and then Miracle came down.

652
00:37:08,975 --> 00:37:11,363
Rym: We're getting scarily close to being let in.

653
00:37:11,383 --> 00:37:12,206
Rym: we're like we're gonna make it.

654
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,641
Rym: we're gonna make it We're gonna get into this room.

655
00:37:14,662 --> 00:37:15,470
Rym: Oh my god.

656
00:37:18,051 --> 00:37:19,275
Scott: Yes, it was a miracle.

657
00:37:19,315 --> 00:37:22,788
Scott: the thing is the reason we got in the room is because they rotated the room 90 degrees.

658
00:37:23,593 --> 00:37:24,790
Scott: They didn't rotate the actual room.

659
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:31,864
Scott: They rotated the chairs and they moved the stage to the other side of the room Which means right that they fit a ton more chairs in there.

660
00:37:31,924 --> 00:37:37,430
Rym: First of all, plus the room was Horizontally vertical as opposed to horizontally horizontal.

661
00:37:37,995 --> 00:37:46,010
Rym: So as a result instead of having you know The why is deep instead of wide they had two screens up on the side of the stage and then they had two more screens.

662
00:37:46,855 --> 00:37:49,170
Scott: It was like they're four screens hanging for the ceiling.

663
00:37:49,311 --> 00:37:53,910
Rym: It was insane and while sitting near the front for pretty much everything we did was really cool.

664
00:37:54,456 --> 00:38:01,730
Rym: If you sat way in the back You had this great spectacle of the stage in the middle and then these four screens splayed out in your peripheral vision.

665
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:04,090
Scott: It was awesome no matter where you were in the room.

666
00:38:04,311 --> 00:38:08,969
Scott: I could not imagine a better layout for a main event short of an actual auditorium.

667
00:38:09,512 --> 00:38:13,489
Rym: Ron Gilbert for the keynote gave an amazing keynote up to par with last year.

668
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:19,190
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty much covered the same topic as last year too of hey, we grew up doing all this old shit.

669
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:21,542
Scott: I mean last year right it was Ken Levine talking about.

670
00:38:21,602 --> 00:38:24,876
Scott: I grew up with Logan's run comics Yeah, and it's in this year.

671
00:38:24,916 --> 00:38:28,930
Scott: He's like I grew up on programming for the Atari and an old TI calculator.

672
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:36,742
Rym: Yep, Ron Gilbert though he get these the two keynotes I've seen at Pax's are just so inspirational every year by the end.

673
00:38:37,104 --> 00:38:38,668
Rym: I'm sitting there thinking man.

674
00:38:38,689 --> 00:38:39,110
Rym: This is it.

675
00:38:39,374 --> 00:38:40,229
Rym: This is what I want to do.

676
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:45,447
Rym: This is why we're here, and I'm just like super inspired and I want to like make stuff And just like it drives me crazy every year.

677
00:38:45,467 --> 00:38:53,209
Scott: yep immediately following the keynote there was some hustling and Gabe and Tyco came out for their Q's and A's.

678
00:38:53,953 --> 00:39:03,888
Rym: It wasn't as epic for us as last year because you know last year We went up, and we asked a pretty epic question, and I remember we were like I'm Rym I'm Scott and then Jerry's like wow it's like you guys have a show and we're like well

679
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:04,129
Scott: we do

680
00:39:05,391 --> 00:39:05,794
Rym: This year.

681
00:39:05,814 --> 00:39:06,518
Rym: I was.

682
00:39:06,538 --> 00:39:07,785
Rym: I was like let's ask a question.

683
00:39:07,805 --> 00:39:08,710
Rym: Scott totally wussed out.

684
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:10,445
Scott: So I was like what are we gonna ask?

685
00:39:10,465 --> 00:39:11,009
Scott: you got nothing?

686
00:39:11,552 --> 00:39:12,984
Rym: I know okay question you had nothing.

687
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:13,810
Rym: I had a good question.

688
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:14,232
Rym: I asked him.

689
00:39:14,474 --> 00:39:16,163
Scott: you know I guess your question was good.

690
00:39:16,243 --> 00:39:20,570
Scott: relative to some of the other questions It wasn't like a yeah, fuck yeah question.

691
00:39:20,731 --> 00:39:26,277
Rym: but what I wanted to know was about because I found out they got someone to do art for the Panel rooms this year.

692
00:39:26,317 --> 00:39:35,130
Rym: because remember you know Jerry kind of randomly was like Let's name them and name the panel rooms the wolf man theater the the Raven theater the unicorn theater.

693
00:39:35,412 --> 00:39:37,247
Scott: So serpent is the big was yep.

694
00:39:37,307 --> 00:39:39,721
Rym: this year They had little crests on every panel room.

695
00:39:40,143 --> 00:39:41,330
Rym: very cool for its theme.

696
00:39:41,772 --> 00:39:46,567
Rym: So I was wondering if I could find out what they were gonna name the PAX East rooms And they haven't even thought about that yet.

697
00:39:47,631 --> 00:39:48,577
Scott: Hopefully I can name them.

698
00:39:49,222 --> 00:39:52,240
Scott: I'll name them the Dragon theater.

699
00:39:52,261 --> 00:40:01,556
Rym: no I Mera I would go with a completely different theme like something way out there in the completely off the wall From the ones before now.

700
00:40:01,696 --> 00:40:03,142
Scott: I would continue with the magical beasts.

701
00:40:03,403 --> 00:40:17,209
Rym: No I would go out like name them all adjectives Like the burning theater the intense theater the angry theaters something crazy, okay, it's okay But I would still go with the magical beasts, but why you already made that you get four more magical beasts.

702
00:40:18,411 --> 00:40:24,090
Rym: Magical beasts a completely separate theme that is just so separate all aquatic beasts.

703
00:40:25,792 --> 00:40:26,815
Rym: So what the aboleth?

704
00:40:27,297 --> 00:40:28,120
Rym: yeah, that's a good one.

705
00:40:28,201 --> 00:40:29,264
Rym: That's the best name for theater.

706
00:40:29,285 --> 00:40:35,988
Rym: yet the belay wait Maybe maybe you combine them because how do you name an inn in any Dungeons & Dragons game?

707
00:40:36,008 --> 00:40:36,068
Rym: the?

708
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:40,622
Rym: Adjective in verb or the adverb the adjective animal anything like that adjective.

709
00:40:40,722 --> 00:40:41,405
Scott: animal theaters.

710
00:40:41,485 --> 00:40:45,375
Rym: so a grunting bore rusting codpiece codpiece.

711
00:40:46,229 --> 00:40:52,169
Scott: oh Man what if you actually themed up like you actually like decorated them like inns and taverns?

712
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:55,605
Rym: You know packs could do that because of their philosophy of having like.

713
00:40:56,168 --> 00:40:58,490
Rym: you know Anime cons have like the one staff.

714
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:02,970
Scott: You know you can make one like a tavern one like a space cantina like a Star Wars.

715
00:41:03,492 --> 00:41:05,320
Scott: Actually, there was a Star Wars cantina.

716
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:07,007
Scott: It was like a LucasArts sponsored room.

717
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:07,650
Scott: That was just a bit.

718
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:10,790
Rym: It was very well put together, and yeah, this is the big Star Wars promotion.

719
00:41:11,011 --> 00:41:12,296
Rym: It was very well put together.

720
00:41:12,336 --> 00:41:15,168
Rym: that good music playing and you could get a sith smoothie for a couple bucks.

721
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:17,587
Scott: Yeah I did not get a system with me.

722
00:41:18,533 --> 00:41:21,305
Rym: They were also taking green-screen pictures of people who are in costume.

723
00:41:21,325 --> 00:41:22,470
Rym: They're actually pretty good-looking.

724
00:41:22,833 --> 00:41:27,821
Scott: Yes, another the Q&A questions were particularly Amazing like oh man epic lols.

725
00:41:27,861 --> 00:41:28,585
Scott: at least the thing is.

726
00:41:28,645 --> 00:41:29,470
Scott: we left early.

727
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:32,810
Rym: We didn't hang around because it went on way too long.

728
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:37,283
Scott: Yeah, they really should limit the Q&A lines or something.

729
00:41:37,324 --> 00:41:38,186
Scott: I don't know what they should do.

730
00:41:38,347 --> 00:41:39,490
Rym: not because it's really enjoyable.

731
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:40,776
Rym: I just it was okay.

732
00:41:40,856 --> 00:41:42,002
Scott: It only wasn't as good as last.

733
00:41:42,102 --> 00:41:43,750
Rym: It only went on way too long because I was hungry.

734
00:41:44,091 --> 00:41:45,901
Scott: Yeah, I was also very not been hungry.

735
00:41:45,921 --> 00:41:47,308
Rym: They wouldn't have not have been too long.

736
00:41:47,549 --> 00:41:53,016
Rym: yep Okay, the other trouble is that they it's great that is democratic But it's tough to screen.

737
00:41:53,117 --> 00:41:56,130
Rym: people are gonna ask a good question versus people are going to be really annoying.

738
00:41:56,491 --> 00:42:00,664
Scott: Yeah, this very relative to the questions you would get at say an anime convention.

739
00:42:01,186 --> 00:42:02,530
Scott: the questions are pretty damn good.

740
00:42:02,611 --> 00:42:05,833
Scott: The thing is they just none of them were like oh my god amazing questions You know.

741
00:42:05,853 --> 00:42:08,150
Scott: and it most of it is like not even questions.

742
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:09,898
Scott: It's people coming up and telling their story.

743
00:42:09,958 --> 00:42:12,490
Scott: like you know I came here from all the way across the country.

744
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:15,202
Scott: Oh, man's I'm selling the cookies cookie Brigade.

745
00:42:15,322 --> 00:42:17,170
Scott: Oh, man's and you know those things.

746
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:22,470
Scott: It's basically everyone make your packs announcements is what it really is the guys who their friend couldn't make it.

747
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:29,090
Rym: So they made a cardboard stand Awesome, and then they Dave and Tyco let the standee come up on stage, and they look a picture with it.

748
00:42:29,572 --> 00:42:33,110
Rym: I saw that standee all around the con like playing games hanging out with people.

749
00:42:33,773 --> 00:42:36,727
Scott: I feel bad for the guy who was in the picture of the sandy who didn't get to come see.

750
00:42:36,767 --> 00:42:48,379
Rym: now what I would do If I were them is I would have made a standee a fake one or maybe one of myself and just use it as an excuse to get to do all this stuff on the Illusion that I'm doing it for my friend who couldn't make it

751
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:49,964
Scott: exactly because that standee

752
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,830
Rym: was like a free pass to do anything cool.

753
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:55,183
Rym: You wanted to do with that kind yep next year sadly.

754
00:42:55,263 --> 00:42:56,929
Rym: I expect to see like a hundred standees.

755
00:42:58,191 --> 00:43:01,285
Scott: So there was a panel on Friday, and it was a Friday night.

756
00:43:01,667 --> 00:43:02,290
Rym: Yes, it was Friday.

757
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:03,690
Scott: Yep, the winning sucks panel.

758
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:06,926
Scott: It was so weird because we looked at the schedule before packs and we put a panel in.

759
00:43:06,966 --> 00:43:10,090
Scott: losing should be fun And we see on the schedule a panel winning sucks.

760
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:11,738
Rym: Well, no it was designing for failure.

761
00:43:11,859 --> 00:43:16,421
Rym: Why winning sucks, and it was done by Jason booth Who's the senior technical designer at Bioware?

762
00:43:16,441 --> 00:43:18,170
Rym: right so big guns kind of guy?

763
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:22,386
Scott: So we look at this right before looking at who what the name was of the person we're like.

764
00:43:22,406 --> 00:43:23,430
Scott: did they rename our panel?

765
00:43:23,751 --> 00:43:24,273
Scott: We're like no.

766
00:43:24,313 --> 00:43:26,201
Scott: They just put two panels with the same idea.

767
00:43:26,281 --> 00:43:28,370
Rym: what whoa think is there's nothing one.

768
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:30,767
Rym: There are a ton of panels that basically cover the same topic.

769
00:43:30,807 --> 00:43:31,170
Rym: impacts.

770
00:43:31,394 --> 00:43:33,556
Scott: I know I know But so we're like whoa.

771
00:43:33,596 --> 00:43:36,749
Scott: so of course we had to check out this other panel that did the same exact thing.

772
00:43:36,769 --> 00:43:38,296
Rym: we did Yep, and it was pretty good.

773
00:43:38,316 --> 00:43:42,374
Scott: the guy definitely took a more a lot of good informations But he was he.

774
00:43:42,615 --> 00:43:46,085
Scott: he just sort of spoke monotone Lee you know and read his.

775
00:43:46,286 --> 00:43:47,610
Scott: you know stuff that he had to say.

776
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:50,650
Scott: Well even from that then when he was doing the Q&A he got a lot more dynamic.

777
00:43:50,891 --> 00:43:54,203
Rym: He took a very textbook approach to it, and he talked a lot.

778
00:43:54,464 --> 00:44:00,987
Rym: He basically covered in a half-hour The like the kinds of topics that if you're already working with games at all you already know all this.

779
00:44:01,268 --> 00:44:05,504
Scott: yep But it was you know it's the kind of stuff that someone with his job has to think about.

780
00:44:05,685 --> 00:44:15,270
Scott: you know like you know You go to a company, and you know you're making a video game, and you're gonna say yeah look We're gonna make it so that you know if you get shot the player lays on the ground and can't do anything.

781
00:44:15,833 --> 00:44:19,029
Scott: And you know you had to sell that to the person you're making this game for.

782
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:21,038
Scott: It's like.

783
00:44:21,299 --> 00:44:22,949
Scott: do you really want to let you make a game like that?

784
00:44:24,252 --> 00:44:24,594
Scott: So it was.

785
00:44:24,795 --> 00:44:26,264
Scott: it was pretty interesting stuff going on.

786
00:44:26,345 --> 00:44:35,173
Rym: so along his lines They reminded me back to the keynote of the whole theme that Look at the people who did the keynotes and a lot of the people who are the big developers at these games now these game Studios and making games.

787
00:44:35,675 --> 00:44:52,029
Rym: they're by and large people who like tinkered and had programming skill and like we're forced to Push themselves and create early on and I don't know what I see this trend where they're like now There's so many people who want to work in video games, but a lot of these people do not have computer skills like.

788
00:44:52,049 --> 00:44:53,235
Rym: they're not Hacking nerds.

789
00:44:53,255 --> 00:44:54,079
Rym: They're just gamers.

790
00:44:54,361 --> 00:44:56,050
Rym: They're people who play games who want to make games.

791
00:44:56,411 --> 00:45:00,670
Rym: It's almost the exact same thing that happened to anime after the first couple of generations of anime directors.

792
00:45:01,134 --> 00:45:02,267
Scott: It's definitely all interesting.

793
00:45:02,388 --> 00:45:06,108
Scott: also I noticed in the keynote and it's some of the other panels and such there was like.

794
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:08,480
Scott: People were really really like they.

795
00:45:08,681 --> 00:45:14,651
Scott: a lot of these game professional people just couldn't get over the fact that Roger Ebert says he doesn't think games are art and Like.

796
00:45:14,691 --> 00:45:17,482
Scott: they just kept bitching about it and obviously everyone disagreed with it.

797
00:45:17,502 --> 00:45:23,910
Scott: and obviously Roger Ebert is wrong though He may be right about many other things and his columns are usually very entertaining if you read them online.

798
00:45:24,391 --> 00:45:30,390
Scott: But it's like the game like professional people just like couldn't get over that and they mentioned it like at a bunch of battles.

799
00:45:30,952 --> 00:45:36,882
Scott: And I thought that that was interesting because he said it's so long ago and it's still like, you know Killing these people that this dude said this.

800
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:37,848
Scott: it's like come on get over it.

801
00:45:38,793 --> 00:45:51,279
Rym: And I was still like Scott pointed out kind of sad that almost all the panels were either like meta panels about game journalism or like meetups and things like that or they were primarily about the video game industry and almost Nothing about any other like other than us.

802
00:45:51,299 --> 00:45:53,290
Rym: There was almost nothing about any other kind of game.

803
00:45:53,391 --> 00:46:00,747
Scott: There was a GM a game a GM panel Art of the Dungeon Master aka the art of being the eye in a World of Warcraft raid.

804
00:46:01,089 --> 00:46:08,697
Scott: Yeah You know, there were a lot of panels that were like, you know, hey, you know, you know this group, you know Like we do this show.

805
00:46:08,797 --> 00:46:09,502
Scott: Here's our panel.

806
00:46:09,542 --> 00:46:10,145
Scott: We do this show.

807
00:46:10,186 --> 00:46:10,870
Scott: Here's our panel.

808
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:11,673
Rym: There was also the.

809
00:46:11,733 --> 00:46:12,356
Rym: I got laid off.

810
00:46:12,396 --> 00:46:14,786
Rym: now what panel that Alex went?

811
00:46:14,826 --> 00:46:15,790
Scott: said he went to this panel.

812
00:46:16,812 --> 00:46:18,730
Scott: That was a strategic game design.

813
00:46:19,172 --> 00:46:27,783
Scott: But actually what he said what it was about was a guy had actually had all these really really interesting Statistics about like, you know games that have a trailer sell this much.

814
00:46:27,843 --> 00:46:29,428
Scott: games with a demo sell this much.

815
00:46:29,468 --> 00:46:34,123
Scott: game with a trailer and A demo sell this much times with no trailer and no demo sell this much.

816
00:46:34,143 --> 00:46:34,284
Scott: now.

817
00:46:34,304 --> 00:46:36,110
Rym: this that data was fascinating.

818
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:41,367
Rym: It was also horrifying because the games that sell the most are the ones with a good trailer and no demo.

819
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:44,799
Rym: if you have a demo Your games probably not gonna sell that.

820
00:46:44,819 --> 00:46:49,230
Scott: a lot of people get all they want from your game out of the demo and they never Need to play your game anymore.

821
00:46:49,354 --> 00:46:54,830
Rym: Think about it If you make a game that is a novel concept like it has a concept and that is what is selling the game like it?

822
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:56,182
Rym: does this new mechanic or something?

823
00:46:56,202 --> 00:47:03,210
Rym: a Gamer type person once they have played that mechanic unless it is a mechanic of death will have no need to ever play it again.

824
00:47:03,391 --> 00:47:04,936
Scott: Here's a perfect example trying.

825
00:47:05,338 --> 00:47:08,469
Scott: if I saw the trailer if there was no demo, I would have just bought it.

826
00:47:08,891 --> 00:47:09,777
Scott: But there was a demo.

827
00:47:09,818 --> 00:47:10,724
Scott: I still haven't bought it yet.

828
00:47:11,409 --> 00:47:15,490
Scott: Yeah Well, you know I might buy it when three people want to play it, but I haven't bought it.

829
00:47:16,411 --> 00:47:19,430
Rym: Pointed out about that explosion game, you know the guy who blows himself up to do stuff.

830
00:47:19,851 --> 00:47:22,661
Scott: It's a great awesome one of the pecs 10.

831
00:47:22,661 --> 00:47:23,183
Rym: I don't think so.

832
00:47:23,504 --> 00:47:24,187
Scott: I think it might have been.

833
00:47:24,548 --> 00:47:25,050
Rym: I don't think so.

834
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:25,439
Rym: I'll look through.

835
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:31,225
Rym: but anyway He pointed out that it's a great and novel mechanic for 25 levels and then it's 25 levels of.

836
00:47:31,245 --> 00:47:32,188
Rym: they ran out of ideas.

837
00:47:32,609 --> 00:47:34,412
Scott: Yep All right.

838
00:47:34,633 --> 00:47:36,138
Scott: So let's see.

839
00:47:36,198 --> 00:47:36,961
Scott: What else happened?

840
00:47:37,021 --> 00:47:38,044
Scott: Is that all for Friday?

841
00:47:38,245 --> 00:47:38,927
Rym: keep petering out?

842
00:47:38,947 --> 00:47:39,670
Rym: I thought you had notes.

843
00:47:39,911 --> 00:47:41,519
Scott: I do but I lose my space in the notes.

844
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:45,109
Scott: cuz I don't have a marker cuz I'm idea screen iPhone screen.

845
00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:50,909
Rym: So after that we're hanging out in the DS lounge lounge to none of those other sissy lounges and one thing.

846
00:47:51,471 --> 00:47:58,439
Rym: Pax was trying to break the world record of the most DS is played in one space at the same time because The world record was like 300 and something.

847
00:47:58,459 --> 00:48:08,250
Scott: Yeah, I figured they would get up to a thousand something, but they only got what 900 I think they blew it away by - you know by getting like 300% more but they still it wasn't.

848
00:48:08,331 --> 00:48:09,259
Scott: I thought it was gonna be thousand.

849
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,695
Rym: I didn't think it would be because People didn't care.

850
00:48:11,755 --> 00:48:14,586
Rym: I didn't want to bother like getting my DS out going up there waiting.

851
00:48:15,289 --> 00:48:21,834
Rym: Yeah Oh, well, but that night the concerts that you know, the Monday concert this year They really a concerts won.

852
00:48:21,894 --> 00:48:36,166
Rym: on Friday concert the problem this year wasn't really a problem per se but they the concerts were definitely led toward Saturday like Saturday was the big Concert and Friday was a lot more laid-back and a lot less looked forward to by a lot of people.

853
00:48:36,186 --> 00:48:47,230
Scott: a lot of people seem To leave the Friday concert early, even though it ended with MC front a lot I mean a Friday had on a Monoguchi who they're okay I mean, I'm not like a huge fan of them, but they put on an okay show.

854
00:48:47,652 --> 00:48:50,870
Rym: I guess I like them but I like their music in the background or while I'm playing games.

855
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:53,581
Rym: They don't like it so much like as an active concert.

856
00:48:53,661 --> 00:48:54,946
Scott: Yeah, then those Metroid metal.

857
00:48:55,147 --> 00:49:01,942
Scott: They were pretty cool You know, it was like it's sort of a combination of a bunch of different guys from like, you know arm cannon and some other.

858
00:49:02,546 --> 00:49:07,595
Scott: you know video game metal bands and They played Metroid metal they were.

859
00:49:07,656 --> 00:49:12,790
Scott: their name was not false advertising and it was Metroid songs in metal and there was okay.

860
00:49:13,032 --> 00:49:15,110
Scott: But it wasn't like, you know, oh my god is the greatest.

861
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:18,670
Rym: But by then the front came out and did his usual front set and it was awesome.

862
00:49:18,972 --> 00:49:20,262
Scott: I'm see front a lot like the house.

863
00:49:20,302 --> 00:49:20,685
Rym: I love em.

864
00:49:20,705 --> 00:49:27,858
Rym: see front a lot Oh shit even though it Definitely a lot of people like the place was barely Crowded at all by the end when we left.

865
00:49:27,878 --> 00:49:29,928
Rym: like a lot of people walked out after the first.

866
00:49:30,028 --> 00:49:39,410
Rym: it was Very late, in fact, I brought my pit boy puppet to the Friday concert and Early on there's a whole bunch of other pit boys.

867
00:49:39,450 --> 00:49:43,824
Rym: So we all get together almost everyone with one left before Metroid metal even came out.

868
00:49:43,904 --> 00:49:44,927
Rym: I was like the last one there.

869
00:49:45,228 --> 00:49:49,041
Scott: Yeah Anyway, that was pretty much it for Friday.

870
00:49:49,081 --> 00:49:50,686
Scott: We went to bed after those concerts.

871
00:49:50,726 --> 00:49:51,067
Rym: I was just.

872
00:49:51,108 --> 00:49:55,090
Scott: I was so wrecked I was wrecked and then we woke up on Saturday.

873
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:59,938
Rym: Luckily Our Saturday panel on Saturday was not until like 1130.

874
00:49:59,938 --> 00:50:03,897
Rym: So we had plenty of time Or no, I think it was a 1030 regardless.

875
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:05,844
Rym: It was not as early as the Sunday panel.

876
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:07,590
Rym: So losing should be fun.

877
00:50:07,651 --> 00:50:09,029
Rym: We had to move up to the Wolfman theater.

878
00:50:09,069 --> 00:50:16,389
Rym: now I know for the Friday panel beyond Candyland We had asked if we could get two wireless mics and they pulled some shenanigans and got one.

879
00:50:17,072 --> 00:50:20,204
Rym: So Saturday we go to the Wolfman theater and we're like, can we get wireless mics?

880
00:50:20,224 --> 00:50:21,530
Rym: and they're like, we don't have any.

881
00:50:21,931 --> 00:50:27,653
Rym: Yeah, some other theater took him yesterday for some panel that asked for him and I was like, ah, damn it That was us.

882
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:29,362
Scott: We started from our future selves.

883
00:50:29,382 --> 00:50:30,508
Scott: Damn it, damn it, damn it.

884
00:50:30,911 --> 00:50:39,450
Scott: we stole from The the Wolfman theater to the Raven theater and then we went from the Wolfman theater the Raven theater to the Wolfman theater.

885
00:50:39,891 --> 00:50:42,821
Scott: Thus we didn't have wireless mics for losing should be fun.

886
00:50:42,901 --> 00:50:43,423
Rym: losing should be.

887
00:50:43,463 --> 00:50:51,685
Rym: fun though was in a bigger theater the Wolfman theater Yeah, and there are crazy ton of people 100% but it felt like 90% and it was definitely more.

888
00:50:51,745 --> 00:50:58,590
Scott: it was actually the most Attended panel because it was a bigger room and it was 90% and also people kept trickling in as the panel went on.

889
00:50:58,650 --> 00:50:59,737
Rym: I think it was full by the end.

890
00:50:59,898 --> 00:51:03,034
Rym: Yeah, it might have been and like one guy walked out But his cell phone was going.

891
00:51:03,074 --> 00:51:03,395
Rym: so

892
00:51:03,495 --> 00:51:14,101
Scott: it was really weird because basically I had to hold this mic that was intended only for people Sitting at the table and I was holding it up in the air so I could stand and if I would have sat down No one would have seen me because I would have been behind this table.

893
00:51:14,382 --> 00:51:17,777
Scott: Meanwhile not on a raised platform I cleverly took the podium.

894
00:51:17,857 --> 00:51:18,841
Scott: There's only one podium.

895
00:51:18,902 --> 00:51:20,930
Scott: It was not very not fair at all.

896
00:51:21,091 --> 00:51:21,980
Rym: Well, you could have taken it.

897
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:22,990
Rym: You just didn't want it enough.

898
00:51:23,072 --> 00:51:28,570
Scott: I took it first But it was he was sitting on the podium was a sort of in a bad position all the way on the right wall.

899
00:51:28,994 --> 00:51:30,208
Scott: Much better to be in the middle of the room.

900
00:51:30,691 --> 00:51:32,940
Rym: Losing should be fun when really well people seem to really dig it.

901
00:51:33,322 --> 00:51:38,724
Rym: the the moment in that panel the two times I've run it that is the moment I wait for is when I put up that slide of that.

902
00:51:38,764 --> 00:51:44,018
Rym: choose your own adventure book UFO 5440. yeah, cuz that's when like everything clicks for the audience.

903
00:51:44,058 --> 00:51:48,247
Scott: Apparently that book changed Jared Sorensen's life in some way.

904
00:51:49,850 --> 00:51:58,850
Rym: I Readed that book from like my elementary school library Yeah, and I didn't realize it was broken because I just like read the book chrono like page by page just to see all the endings.

905
00:52:00,131 --> 00:52:02,782
Scott: Yeah, it was a good panel panel.

906
00:52:02,822 --> 00:52:04,870
Scott: also we got really good questions at the end of that panel.

907
00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:07,330
Scott: Yeah, I didn't do too many, but they were all like really great question.

908
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:12,113
Rym: I left like 10 minutes at the end for questions and and even afterward people ask great questions And it was just.

909
00:52:12,516 --> 00:52:14,690
Rym: overall it was a great panel, and I was glad we did it.

910
00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:15,053
Rym: I'm gonna.

911
00:52:15,497 --> 00:52:27,150
Rym: we're not gonna do this panel again But what I'm going to do is break it up into two or three separate panels and do them over the years Like I want to do a panel just about victory conditions, and then a separate panel about losing in role-playing games.

912
00:52:27,612 --> 00:52:30,645
Scott: Yep, so is this one who went into the PC area or not?

913
00:52:30,726 --> 00:52:31,670
Scott: I don't remember well.

914
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:35,330
Rym: The thing is I want to point out that when we walked out of this panel You know Jared was there at the panel.

915
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:40,030
Rym: I think Luke was in the audience to Lou Crane and Jared was like that was a great panel too bad.

916
00:52:40,110 --> 00:52:41,194
Rym: Everything you said was wrong.

917
00:52:41,476 --> 00:52:43,965
Rym: Yep, but no all his point was and he's right.

918
00:52:44,065 --> 00:52:45,230
Rym: I just didn't make this clear enough.

919
00:52:45,671 --> 00:52:52,010
Rym: He said that if the future of all game if the future of gaming and losing is you know the dwarf fortress style enriching the?

920
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:55,625
Rym: World procedural content generation, then there will be no more narrative.

921
00:52:55,645 --> 00:53:00,121
Rym: and he had this whole like Question and response and this whole like criticism of my panel.

922
00:53:00,743 --> 00:53:05,650
Rym: and the only response I had was yeah I didn't make it clear that it's not the end of all of gaming.

923
00:53:05,971 --> 00:53:10,770
Rym: It's just that procedural content like that will fill in the gaps and the background for the narrative.

924
00:53:11,072 --> 00:53:17,029
Scott: Yeah, that's you know there's a lot to be said there And you know you can't say everything there is to say in a 60-minute panel.

925
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:17,775
Rym: Well, that's the.

926
00:53:17,816 --> 00:53:18,664
Rym: that's the thing with all.

927
00:53:18,704 --> 00:53:24,250
Rym: three of the panels We did at PAX were not the kind of specific detailed like very in-depth panel.

928
00:53:24,310 --> 00:53:33,509
Scott: They were very much the low-hanging fruit of you guys gaming panels the kind of the kind of panels We do or the kind of things to get you thinking not to make a big statement or anything.

929
00:53:33,589 --> 00:53:39,341
Rym: yep But we're gonna now that we've gotten the low-hanging fruit out of the way We've got to do the crazy specific like awesome.

930
00:53:39,401 --> 00:53:44,218
Scott: I want to do some panels like about real like Individual games like this is natural selection.

931
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,766
Scott: You know or this is Puerto Rico.

932
00:53:46,826 --> 00:53:48,777
Scott: I want to do that kind of stuff You know.

933
00:53:48,797 --> 00:53:51,134
Scott: I wonder how many people want to see it though It's hard to say.

934
00:53:51,194 --> 00:53:54,250
Rym: I'm gauging that we gained a following by the end of packs.

935
00:53:54,371 --> 00:53:57,869
Rym: So I think next year and impacts East we're going to be able to.

936
00:53:58,351 --> 00:54:01,728
Rym: People will come to our panels just because we're running them regardless of what the title is.

937
00:54:01,748 --> 00:54:05,889
Rym: hopefully So we'll get like this following half and hopefully the other half will be random people walking in.

938
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:06,988
Scott: Yeah, it sounds like about that.

939
00:54:07,291 --> 00:54:11,290
Scott: I don't remember if this is when we went there, but it's like about the PC gaming and we didn't go there till later.

940
00:54:11,593 --> 00:54:13,009
Scott: Yeah, I just want to talk about it now.

941
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:19,296
Rym: Just cuz I remember it because right after this we went to the tabletop gaming area, and we played that little Tile game.

942
00:54:19,356 --> 00:54:21,070
Scott: hive all right the hive game.

943
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:21,936
Rym: It was a fun little game.

944
00:54:21,956 --> 00:54:22,439
Rym: you have these like.

945
00:54:22,459 --> 00:54:25,095
Rym: you have little hive and you place all your pieces Then you jump them around.

946
00:54:25,115 --> 00:54:35,490
Rym: you try to surround the other person's queen and while it's a game That's fiddly and feels like it go on forever You it is a game where a clever player can force equip a mate effectively, and I liked it.

947
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:36,173
Rym: I might just buy it.

948
00:54:36,454 --> 00:54:37,881
Scott: you know that where you gonna find it.

949
00:54:38,062 --> 00:54:39,810
Rym: I'll find it somewhere eBay if I have to.

950
00:54:40,232 --> 00:54:40,976
Scott: That's not the kind of game.

951
00:54:40,996 --> 00:54:43,510
Scott: It looks like it's easy to get but yeah, it's interesting game.

952
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:47,033
Scott: We had little bugs, and you you put them out and you position them And you you know.

953
00:54:47,194 --> 00:54:49,221
Rym: Scott thought he had me because he went for the quick victory.

954
00:54:49,583 --> 00:54:51,450
Rym: the problem was for the direct room.

955
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:54,450
Rym: He's quick direct victory, so he you know he's almost surrounded my guy.

956
00:54:54,812 --> 00:54:58,030
Rym: But then I basically just locked in all his guys who were surrounding my guy.

957
00:54:58,432 --> 00:55:01,650
Rym: He couldn't finish it, and they're just leisurely surrounded his queen and ended the game.

958
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:03,128
Rym: He couldn't stop me yeah.

959
00:55:03,310 --> 00:55:06,728
Rym: Well the only way to stop me was to put take all of his pressure off of my queen.

960
00:55:06,768 --> 00:55:10,669
Rym: it was great Yep, it was okay And we didn't actually play.

961
00:55:11,051 --> 00:55:15,889
Rym: But we taught these cool people who were inspired by our panel to play Puerto Rico.

962
00:55:16,030 --> 00:55:17,959
Scott: well No first he played blackest with some people.

963
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:21,517
Rym: Oh, yeah, we ran into those people who played block is with him And then we played Puerto Rico.

964
00:55:21,577 --> 00:55:23,990
Scott: yep, well we taught the same people how to play Puerto Rico.

965
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:26,923
Rym: Yep But we didn't actually play it and we didn't get to play all the way through.

966
00:55:26,964 --> 00:55:32,685
Rym: we played a couple of rounds and Definitely it is so much better to have someone else teach you a game than to learn it yourself.

967
00:55:33,026 --> 00:55:40,629
Rym: Yeah, yeah definitely I feel like we should run panels that are basically learn out like an hour-long panel learn how to play Puerto Rico and teeny.

968
00:55:41,191 --> 00:55:48,498
Scott: Well, that's why I'm sort of excited to get some gaming space at PAX East as opposed to you know some panel space because I Can just basically teach people games all day.

969
00:55:48,839 --> 00:55:50,485
Scott: and the best thing is you go to a gaming con.

970
00:55:50,525 --> 00:56:00,459
Scott: right it'll take you a long Time to learn how to play a game for the instruction book like possibly an hour if it's a complicated game worth playing and then You basically lost an hour of your convention.

971
00:56:00,539 --> 00:56:03,048
Scott: if someone taught you how to play the game you could have saved 45 convention minutes.

972
00:56:03,811 --> 00:56:05,690
Scott: That's a big freaking deal all right?

973
00:56:05,790 --> 00:56:09,990
Scott: So it's all about teaching people how to play games and then learning how to play games from other people.

974
00:56:10,632 --> 00:56:20,722
Rym: so pretty much right after that though the reason we had to bail is that we had to go line up for the make a strip and then you know go get some food and The make a strip did not actually happen at that point.

975
00:56:20,883 --> 00:56:26,278
Rym: and after basically we get there And we line up we get it really good seats And it's delayed a little bit.

976
00:56:26,459 --> 00:56:28,930
Rym: so basically we sat there, and they did a Q&A again.

977
00:56:29,211 --> 00:56:35,184
Rym: They didn't even have Jerry there because he he formed babby yep, so it's Scott Kurtz and Gabe.

978
00:56:35,344 --> 00:56:35,625
Scott: right.

979
00:56:36,046 --> 00:56:41,325
Scott: well Mike Krahulik and Basically, they're trying to get his you know computer to work at the Photoshop.

980
00:56:41,346 --> 00:56:47,575
Rym: I'll sum this up greens We sat there for 45 minutes while he clicked on the same resolution over and over again And it didn't work.

981
00:56:47,937 --> 00:56:56,050
Rym: and meanwhile people ask questions, but I got to say They were answering the questions pretty funnily, but Gabe and Tycho together is where the magic happens.

982
00:56:56,110 --> 00:57:02,097
Rym: They just like the answers were classy in the wide well sense, but they were not Full-on classy.

983
00:57:02,118 --> 00:57:02,620
Rym: they were not.

984
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,409
Rym: they were not as classy as they could have been.

985
00:57:04,449 --> 00:57:08,647
Scott: yeah I wasn't lining up for more Q&A I was lining up to see make a strip, and I did not happen.

986
00:57:08,767 --> 00:57:11,650
Rym: so eventually We just bailed and got some food at that awesome.

987
00:57:12,731 --> 00:57:14,958
Scott: Kurtz did mention Kate Beaton so he gets points.

988
00:57:15,019 --> 00:57:17,628
Rym: he did and we wooed with a few other people that would.

989
00:57:17,648 --> 00:57:19,143
Scott: yep That was pretty you know.

990
00:57:20,093 --> 00:57:23,433
Rym: Anyway, yep, so if you went back to tabletop hanging out There's some more.

991
00:57:23,453 --> 00:57:31,064
Rym: a Luke Crane was running a whole bunch of burning wheel on Some burning wheel with some sort of like court of undead something something.

992
00:57:31,104 --> 00:57:31,867
Scott: I want to play that.

993
00:57:31,907 --> 00:57:32,870
Scott: what the hell was that yeah?

994
00:57:32,970 --> 00:57:40,498
Rym: I walked in one before and one player was pleading his case before the court, and I heard the words your honor I did not know with the time that they were vampires.

995
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:42,365
Rym: Yeah, it was so great.

996
00:57:42,526 --> 00:57:44,355
Scott: whatever that game was Luke I want get.

997
00:57:44,375 --> 00:57:46,190
Scott: send me a copy and a PDF also.

998
00:57:46,210 --> 00:57:46,993
Scott: I want to play it now.

999
00:57:47,033 --> 00:57:48,498
Rym: apparently Luke is running like.

1000
00:57:48,518 --> 00:57:49,160
Rym: he ran this campaign.

1001
00:57:50,032 --> 00:57:52,546
Rym: There was a continuation of a campaign he ran at PAX last year.

1002
00:57:52,566 --> 00:58:00,470
Rym: I didn't know this I didn't hear this and also Jared Sorenson of all people had never until that time played the sword.

1003
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:01,628
Scott: Oh my gosh.

1004
00:58:02,273 --> 00:58:04,909
Rym: so he was kind of geeking about it and he was the elf.

1005
00:58:04,969 --> 00:58:09,629
Rym: and It's hard to be the elf because you feel like you can just kill everyone and take the sword But that never works out.

1006
00:58:09,778 --> 00:58:10,352
Scott: No It doesn't.

1007
00:58:11,015 --> 00:58:16,236
Rym: but we grind into some other people later who played the sword and they loved it and people People are really diggin.

1008
00:58:16,276 --> 00:58:17,261
Scott: It's a mouse guard demos.

1009
00:58:17,301 --> 00:58:19,855
Rym: I saw yeah, and later I was happy.

1010
00:58:19,875 --> 00:58:27,910
Rym: you know I got to talk to taiko for a brief moment And he recognized me enough to be like yeah, I heard some people were playing this playing mouse guard at this con.

1011
00:58:28,051 --> 00:58:29,544
Rym: I was like yeah, it was yesterday.

1012
00:58:29,584 --> 00:58:29,967
Rym: You missed it.

1013
00:58:29,987 --> 00:58:30,250
Rym: He was like.

1014
00:58:31,251 --> 00:58:33,601
Scott: The thing is I think he's just really good like what he.

1015
00:58:33,621 --> 00:58:39,370
Scott: you know the way he ties like you go up to him and Say hey, how about the game summer flange, but yeah, I heard about that summer flange.

1016
00:58:39,551 --> 00:58:42,043
Rym: No, no because he mentioned mouse guard unprompted to me.

1017
00:58:42,264 --> 00:58:43,509
Scott: really yes, huh?

1018
00:58:43,913 --> 00:58:45,330
Rym: I'll talk about that later when it happened.

1019
00:58:45,390 --> 00:58:58,193
Scott: But basically where we played a bunch of Dominion with row and Jeremy and where you know we saw all the people playing Dominion Dominion is a game like if the game got really popular on board game geek, and I checked it out and basically It's a game.

1020
00:58:58,213 --> 00:59:00,601
Scott: That's a collectible card game, but it's not collectible right.

1021
00:59:00,862 --> 00:59:02,950
Scott: so that makes me excited because that's what I always wanted.

1022
00:59:03,392 --> 00:59:04,497
Scott: But then an anime Boston.

1023
00:59:04,537 --> 00:59:10,037
Scott: we opened it up, and I read the rules and I was like These rules don't look so good.

1024
00:59:10,057 --> 00:59:13,730
Rym: from reading the rules the game looked a bit shit, and I guess here's the deal.

1025
00:59:13,810 --> 00:59:14,493
Rym: We didn't back it.

1026
00:59:14,674 --> 00:59:16,784
Scott: the game was hyped up big time, so you know what.

1027
00:59:16,844 --> 00:59:18,110
Scott: I don't knock it without trying it.

1028
00:59:18,552 --> 00:59:19,196
Scott: So it packs.

1029
00:59:19,497 --> 00:59:20,463
Scott: someone knew how to play.

1030
00:59:20,503 --> 00:59:21,670
Scott: we didn't have to teach it to ourselves.

1031
00:59:22,794 --> 00:59:27,668
Scott: It's fucking awesome, I bought Dominion and Dominion intrigue online today, it's already shipped.

1032
00:59:27,708 --> 00:59:28,090
Scott: It's coming.

1033
00:59:28,311 --> 00:59:30,859
Rym: It's not a hardcore game in the old sense like.

1034
00:59:30,899 --> 00:59:34,110
Rym: it's not a Puerto Rico or a teeny, but it plays quick.

1035
00:59:34,592 --> 00:59:35,415
Rym: It's real fun.

1036
00:59:35,916 --> 00:59:39,650
Rym: It's just it has these novel mechanics that I want to pull into other games.

1037
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:46,510
Scott: Oh, yeah, the whole making your deck while you're playing as a new set coming out Dominion seaside with some water cards.

1038
00:59:47,072 --> 00:59:48,937
Scott: So I'm all about Dominion.

1039
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:56,250
Rym: get as much Dominion as you can and the game is so different every time you play because you Kind of create the world in which you're going to make the game basically.

1040
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:57,074
Scott: Yeah, it's like you bought.

1041
00:59:57,094 --> 01:00:03,850
Scott: you get this box of cards, and there's like all kinds of different cards in there But you pick ten different ones every time you play and if you get multiple boxes.

1042
01:00:04,251 --> 01:00:09,506
Scott: There's just so many exponentially more combinations of ten cards you can pick to play the game with.

1043
01:00:09,968 --> 01:00:10,770
Scott: so it's like oh fuck.

1044
01:00:10,810 --> 01:00:13,178
Scott: Yes, you can play this game forever like with three sets.

1045
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:15,788
Scott: You're never gonna run out of combinations ever.

1046
01:00:16,189 --> 01:00:21,794
Rym: right This game will entertain you for a long time, but like one game like this the final scores are like I think row one with I can't.

1047
01:00:21,815 --> 01:00:22,839
Scott: the first not 23 the first game.

1048
01:00:22,859 --> 01:00:29,042
Scott: I won by one 28 over your 27 yeah, and the second game.

1049
01:00:29,082 --> 01:00:30,468
Scott: my final score was negative one.

1050
01:00:30,849 --> 01:00:31,752
Scott: yes I got hose.

1051
01:00:31,833 --> 01:00:40,150
Rym: Scott score was negative one in the curse game where basically we went through the entire curse deck in like Like almost nothing is everyone kept getting cursed constantly.

1052
01:00:40,150 --> 01:00:48,530
Scott: I and I won the first game because I managed to get rid of a lot of my curses But in the second game I was just burdened with too many curses.

1053
01:00:48,734 --> 01:00:49,510
Scott: I couldn't do anything.

1054
01:00:49,590 --> 01:00:58,979
Rym: But then we had a really nice game was like the opposite of the bastard game where it was mostly constructive stuff and everyone else Tried to do some cool combinations Doing look what felt good of playing like.

1055
01:00:58,999 --> 01:01:01,730
Scott: I got like a whole bunch of markets and they played him success.

1056
01:01:01,851 --> 01:01:03,037
Rym: I'm playing all these combos.

1057
01:01:03,058 --> 01:01:04,586
Rym: He's like market market market market market.

1058
01:01:04,989 --> 01:01:11,290
Rym: meanwhile I just bought silver and I bought provinces silver provinces silver provinces And I just won the game with a million points.

1059
01:01:12,372 --> 01:01:19,510
Scott: Silver is definitely the way to go for reals And gold and a lot of gold - gold is okay gold is great gold is you kidding?

1060
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:20,132
Scott: I like gold.

Scott: you got to get rid of your copper.

1062
01:01:21,619 --> 01:01:23,750
Scott: That's the thing that's getting rid of the copper and the curse.

1063
01:01:23,830 --> 01:01:25,116
Rym: I was trashing copper.

1064
01:01:25,237 --> 01:01:26,422
Scott: Yeah, you make more room.

1065
01:01:26,663 --> 01:01:27,145
Scott: That's right.

1066
01:01:27,486 --> 01:01:27,687

1076
01:01:54,790 --> 01:01:59,310
Rym: We ran into a guy who had nothing to do with Pax But he's just like some guy who works in the area like he owns a business.

1077
01:01:59,391 --> 01:02:02,389
Scott: I mean, you know, I think he worked at a steakhouse as a waiter and he was like, you know what?

1078
01:02:03,310 --> 01:02:05,017
Rym: Pax is like the best thing to happen to Seattle.

1079
01:02:05,057 --> 01:02:06,221
Rym: you guys spend so much money.

1080
01:02:06,322 --> 01:02:06,924
Rym: Seriously.

01:02:09,795 --> 01:02:13,810
Rym: Yeah, people didn't have as many good things to say about certain other unnamed cons that happen in Seattle.

1083
01:02:13,951 --> 01:02:16,262
Scott: Yeah, we played this game called a quarto.

1084
01:02:16,282 --> 01:02:17,127
Rym: It sucks.

1085
01:02:17,348 --> 01:02:18,595
Scott: It sucks It's just.

1086
01:02:18,836 --> 01:02:23,890
Scott: it looked like some sort of abstract strategy game But really it's just the left-right game and there's nothing to it.

1087
01:02:23,950 --> 01:02:27,490
Rym: Yep Scott won it like all of the three times we played it and then we put it away and that was the end of that.

1088
01:02:27,551 --> 01:02:28,116
Scott: That's the end of that.

1089
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:29,490
Rym: but there was this game.

1090
01:02:29,570 --> 01:02:37,650
Rym: We're walking out to the bodega and we see these guys these people playing this game With all these plastic dog figures really big ones and they had them all lined up like in a row.

1091
01:02:38,272 --> 01:02:41,685
Rym: So we're like man does the game play that where you guys just bored.

1092
01:02:41,725 --> 01:02:42,970
Rym: but they're like now the game plays this way.

1093
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:47,610
Rym: And I was like this game looks like it sucks and they're like, yeah, but we're gonna try it.

1094
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:48,515
Rym: So I gave him my business card.

1095
01:02:48,535 --> 01:02:50,829
Rym: I was like, alright, I do a radio show.

1096
01:02:51,271 --> 01:02:54,946
Rym: Let me know how bad this game sucks when I forgot about it.

1097
01:02:55,347 --> 01:03:01,808
Rym: like two hours later I get this phone call from number I don't recognize and this guy's just like that dog game sucks ass and that's it.

1098
01:03:01,868 --> 01:03:02,410

Rym: Yeah.

1100
01:03:03,132 --> 01:03:05,291

01:03:05,331 --> 01:03:07,278
Scott: there's a lot of people played this game wasabi.

1102
01:03:07,298 --> 01:03:08,684

Scott: I mean I get to play it.

1106
01:03:14,465 --> 01:03:20,930
Scott: but you know What are the games that I see people playing as primarily I saw people playing munchkin and Dominion and one point.

1107
01:03:21,051 --> 01:03:23,264
Scott: I taught like 10 people how to play a curricula at once.

1108
01:03:23,747 --> 01:03:24,290
Scott: That was pretty good.

1109
01:03:24,310 --> 01:03:25,778
Rym: That was actually on this day you.

1110
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:31,347
Rym: basically we saw these people playing a curricula Learning how to play and we're like they're like, yeah, we were inspired by your panels.

1111
01:03:31,367 --> 01:03:31,930
Rym: We just got the game.

1112
01:03:31,930 --> 01:03:32,461
Rym: We're gonna play it.

1113
01:03:32,930 --> 01:03:40,002
Rym: So Scott's about to teach them how to play and I noticed next to them is another group of people and I thought they were Playing a curricula, but no they were trying to learn.

1114
01:03:40,022 --> 01:03:42,374
Rym: so I was like Listen to that guy.

1115
01:03:42,415 --> 01:03:43,219
Rym: He'll teach you how to play.

1116
01:03:43,782 --> 01:03:45,290
Scott: So I taught everyone how to play a curricula laser.

1117
01:03:45,391 --> 01:03:56,870
Rym: I met one of the guys who played a curricula in the bathroom and he's like, yeah, I totally won Hahaha, so at this moment, you know We realized there's this big Steve Jackson area and we see of all people Steve Jackson.

1118
01:03:57,332 --> 01:04:00,423
Scott: I saw it on the Twitter's like Steve Jackson signing under the escalator.

1119
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:02,229
Scott: and behold there he is under the escalator.

1120
01:04:02,572 --> 01:04:04,949
Scott: Yeah, I we saw seen him in like five years.

1121
01:04:05,411 --> 01:04:08,744
Rym: So we we went up to him and Philip Reed was there too is another.

1122
01:04:08,785 --> 01:04:11,695
Rym: he's the CEO of Steve Jackson games.

1123
01:04:11,995 --> 01:04:16,830
Scott: they're making man Steve Jackson games like the munchkin must be making them so much fucking money.

1124
01:04:17,192 --> 01:04:26,851
Rym: Oh my god, especially, you know munchkin is kind of cool the way they've got it like, you know while we're talking some guy comes up who's a fan of Steve Jackson and games and they gave him this coin and It.

1125
01:04:27,152 --> 01:04:31,349
Rym: they have the rule for the coin changes like whenever Steve Jackson game feels like it.

1126
01:04:31,813 --> 01:04:32,459
Rym: So you go online.

1127
01:04:32,479 --> 01:04:33,590
Rym: you can find out what the rule is.

1128
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:37,207
Rym: If you've got that coin, it changes the game of munchkin with everyone else you're playing.

1129
01:04:37,227 --> 01:04:37,669
Scott: I am.

1130
01:04:38,491 --> 01:04:45,503
Rym: So the munchkin wasn't that good early on because it was just kind of this Okay card game, but now that it is nothing more than a meta game.

1131
01:04:45,904 --> 01:04:47,490
Rym: It's like it's cooler in my eyes.

1132
01:04:47,831 --> 01:04:48,354
Rym: It's a game.

1133
01:04:48,374 --> 01:04:51,850
Rym: it has that magic of what magic the gathering had before the internet.

1134
01:04:52,292 --> 01:04:55,470
Rym: You'd show up at a game and someone whiffs out this crazy card and you're like, oh shit.

1135
01:04:56,038 --> 01:05:01,590
Scott: Well, I mean, you know It's a non collectible game that plays like a collectible card game sort of which what I like about?

1136
01:05:01,710 --> 01:05:05,190
Scott: You know Dominion, but it's not actually a good game.

1137
01:05:05,331 --> 01:05:09,410
Rym: Oh, it has desire to play but it has all these meta rules and it encourages meta gaming.

1138
01:05:09,510 --> 01:05:11,826
Rym: I mean if you wear munchkin merchandise you get a bonus.

1139
01:05:12,128 --> 01:05:15,447
Rym: Yeah So what if a guy comes with like a hundred munchkin t-shirts on?

1140
01:05:15,628 --> 01:05:20,170
Rym: yeah Oh, man, so we go up to Steve Jackson and we won't tell the whole story again.

1141
01:05:20,210 --> 01:05:24,264
Rym: But we got closure on the previous Steve Jackson story.

1142
01:05:24,284 --> 01:05:27,676
Rym: the last time we had talked to Steve Jackson There were unresolved issues.

1143
01:05:27,716 --> 01:05:29,242
Rym: We got closure on all of them.

1144
01:05:29,402 --> 01:05:30,506
Scott: Yeah, it was very good time.

1145
01:05:30,526 --> 01:05:31,530
Scott: Steve Jackson was awesome.

1146
01:05:31,811 --> 01:05:33,438
Rym: We're gonna try to like get an interview with him.

1147
01:05:33,498 --> 01:05:36,794
Rym: or actually I'd really like to talk to Phillip Reed because that guy seemed really Really cool.

1148
01:05:36,996 --> 01:05:38,890
Scott: Yeah, definitely seemed like he knows going on But

1149
01:05:38,930 --> 01:05:44,996
Rym: apparently the Steve Jackson story at PAX was that he personally did not go to the last packs But people in his organization did

1150
01:05:45,578 --> 01:05:49,634
Scott: and he had all these like guys who had shirts that were like, you know Like they're like.

1151
01:05:49,955 --> 01:05:53,090
Scott: they're like Steve Jackson games secret crew or whatever.

1152
01:05:53,411 --> 01:05:57,910
Rym: So he basically he was forced to go to PAX and he was like PAX was super awesome.

1153
01:05:57,990 --> 01:05:59,339
Rym: But there is more Steve Jackson.

1154
01:05:59,359 --> 01:06:00,205
Rym: We'll get back to that.

1155
01:06:00,225 --> 01:06:00,829
Rym: Mm-hmm.

1156
01:06:01,371 --> 01:06:12,170
Rym: so after all that we're walking around looking for stuff to do before the lineup for the crazy awesome Saturday night concerts and We see the bring your own computer area and Scott's like, why don't we just see if we can get in there?

1157
01:06:12,370 --> 01:06:13,916

1158
01:06:13,956 --> 01:06:19,906
Scott: We went into the you know, use a computer they provide for you area Which is all these Dell machines like hundreds of them.

1159
01:06:19,926 --> 01:06:20,590
Scott: It's crazy.

1160
01:06:20,711 --> 01:06:21,197
Rym: I'll say this.

1161
01:06:21,319 --> 01:06:27,790
Rym: it would have been cool Except that steam and valve are assholes when it comes to land gaming and they basically fucked packs.

1162
01:06:28,062 --> 01:06:37,490
Scott: Yeah Well, I mean the thing was if you wanted to play a game that was installed like if you wanted to play counter-strike or tf2 You were in business like it was you know, the thing is you want to play some NS?

1163
01:06:38,270 --> 01:06:39,073
Scott: Sorry, no go.

1164
01:06:39,294 --> 01:06:42,828
Rym: not only that you couldn't even log into your own steam account because of the way valve runs.

1165
01:06:42,868 --> 01:06:45,036
Rym: these things Yeah, tags had no control over that.

1166
01:06:45,076 --> 01:06:46,040
Rym: those like what can I say?

1167
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:53,117
Scott: Yeah, it's basically all those machines are provided by sponsors I'm pretty sure like Intel Dell Steam whoever, you know, whoever provides them.

1168
01:06:53,158 --> 01:06:54,021
Scott: I don't even know right?

1169
01:06:54,423 --> 01:06:55,930
Scott: so it's not something to see.

1170
01:06:56,071 --> 01:07:01,600
Scott: You know packs has a lot of control over but you know they basically install games on there and that's what you can play.

1171
01:07:01,901 --> 01:07:08,390
Scott: and if case you didn't bring your own computer and a lot of People go in there and play because a lot of people want to play Team Fortress 2 or Left 4 Dead or whatever.

1172
01:07:08,531 --> 01:07:09,296
Scott: So there you go.

1173
01:07:09,457 --> 01:07:09,597
Rym: Yep.

1174
01:07:09,678 --> 01:07:11,630
Rym: It was okay and a lot of people were playing Left 4 Dead.

1175
01:07:11,710 --> 01:07:13,479
Rym: But then you know, we wanted to go into.

1176
01:07:13,499 --> 01:07:15,650
Rym: bring your own computer area, but you need a special badge.

1177
01:07:15,993 --> 01:07:17,710
Rym: Look at penny arcade and Pax's brilliance.

1178
01:07:18,731 --> 01:07:20,801
Rym: The best way to stop theft is just you.

1179
01:07:20,841 --> 01:07:22,730
Rym: you can only go in if you brought a computer.

1180
01:07:22,972 --> 01:07:24,622
Rym: Yep, so it already limits it to.

1181
01:07:24,642 --> 01:07:25,849
Rym: the people are into that sort of thing.

1182
01:07:26,091 --> 01:07:29,210
Scott: So I go up to the guy, you know, there's like foreign forces at the door.

1183
01:07:29,290 --> 01:07:41,452
Scott: There's no way you're getting in that room unless you brought your own computer, right and I'm like, hey, listen, I'm a speaker I didn't bring my own computer But I just want to go around and look at the sweet modded rigs in there and the guys just like come on I'll show

1184
01:07:41,472 --> 01:07:41,874
Rym: you around.

1185
01:07:41,915 --> 01:07:42,700
Rym: Well, no first he's like.

1186
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:44,009
Rym: no, I can't let it just let you in.

1187
01:07:44,753 --> 01:07:45,940
Rym: He's like but you know what.

1188
01:07:46,021 --> 01:07:47,590
Rym: just follow me I'll take you around man.

1189
01:07:47,932 --> 01:07:50,950
Rym: So he takes us in and we got to look at like all the awesome cases.

1190
01:07:51,475 --> 01:07:52,565
Scott: Yeah, and that was where I saw.

1191
01:07:52,585 --> 01:07:59,130
Scott: the winner You know of the mod case contest was the NFC systems guy and is it was a deserve to be the winner.

1192
01:07:59,251 --> 01:08:00,055
Scott: It was so fucking awesome.

1193
01:08:00,095 --> 01:08:10,100
Rym: I gotta say though that that case with the vacuum tubes on it I thought it was cool and while the judges gave them a bad criticism for the external power supply I thought the external power supply was awesome.

1194
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:12,330
Scott: I think I think the external power supply was awesome.

1195
01:08:12,350 --> 01:08:16,590
Scott: I think he just needed to style up the external power supply for some extra awesomes.

1196
01:08:17,330 --> 01:08:19,910
Scott: Yeah, it was basically just an external power supply.

1197
01:08:20,131 --> 01:08:23,130
Rym: The cool thing is it was like an entirely different con in that room.

1198
01:08:23,170 --> 01:08:25,162
Rym: It reminded me of the land part as they used to go to.

1199
01:08:25,183 --> 01:08:26,370
Scott: when I mean basically, right?

1200
01:08:26,450 --> 01:08:30,973
Scott: You look at the way Pax goes and there are a lot of enforcers who stay in one area Like the like.

1201
01:08:31,374 --> 01:08:36,689
Scott: if you look at like the console area at Pax was basically the equivalent of all of game katsu.

1202
01:08:37,091 --> 01:08:38,942
Scott: Right as they say game katsu in there.

1203
01:08:38,962 --> 01:08:48,670
Scott: if you went in that room and didn't leave it It was no different than being a game in the game area of katsu kata not leaving it All right minus the arcade machines going in the PC land area.

1204
01:08:49,091 --> 01:08:56,443
Scott: It's basically like going to any old land party and you just don't leave and a lot of people just went to that land party And that's that was their con the land party.

1205
01:08:56,785 --> 01:08:57,569
Scott: It's totally awesome.

1206
01:08:57,711 --> 01:08:58,715
Rym: I'm thinking for Pax East.

1207
01:08:58,875 --> 01:09:01,848
Scott: if I can swing it with ax East everyone bring your own computer.

1208
01:09:01,868 --> 01:09:05,279
Rym: It's NS2 tribes - I don't know because we're viable.

1209
01:09:05,319 --> 01:09:05,881
Scott: we called it.

1210
01:09:06,162 --> 01:09:11,325
Rym: we still have to talk to Khalil and all we have to set up what we're doing for Pax East.

1211
01:09:11,385 --> 01:09:14,300
Rym: we might be doing Too much stuff at Pax East.

1212
01:09:14,340 --> 01:09:20,029
Rym: we might be much like Gabe and Tycho ghosts at Pax as in we're only doing events and then we disappear.

1213
01:09:20,151 --> 01:09:23,470
Scott: This is like we're gonna have people do arrange some of this stuff in our name.

1214
01:09:23,731 --> 01:09:24,854
Scott: We're gonna make it happen.

1215
01:09:24,953 --> 01:09:27,001
Scott: Even if we're not physically they're making it happen.

1216
01:09:27,301 --> 01:09:33,145
Rym: Yes, but Pax East we can't talk about Pax East But bring your own computer to Pax East trust me.

1217
01:09:33,165 --> 01:09:34,189
Scott: I'm gonna bring in mine.

1218
01:09:34,189 --> 01:09:35,979
Rym: I'm gonna have to upgrade mine before I bring it.

1219
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,127
Rym: I'm not hardcore enough.

1220
01:09:37,689 --> 01:09:39,528
Scott: I just need to get one of those carrying straps for mine.

1221
01:09:40,372 --> 01:09:47,184
Rym: So the Saturday night concert freeze-pop had new songs Totally awesome, even though the dude retired.

1222
01:09:47,203 --> 01:09:49,209
Rym: Yeah, that was sad But you know what?

1223
01:09:49,710 --> 01:09:49,911
Rym: It was.

1224
01:09:50,011 --> 01:09:50,533
Rym: it was very.

1225
01:09:50,573 --> 01:09:58,180
Rym: it was a very touching moment when he announced his retirement and then as like this final like the big Song for him they did for his spot forever.

1226
01:09:58,200 --> 01:09:58,702
Rym: Yep.

1227
01:09:59,023 --> 01:10:00,247
Rym: It almost brought a tear to my eye.

1228
01:10:00,268 --> 01:10:00,890
Rym: It was really cute.

1229
01:10:01,890 --> 01:10:03,957
Rym: But Paul and storm I was surprised.

1230
01:10:03,997 --> 01:10:07,407
Scott: like how many freeze-pop songs I knew it's like.

1231
01:10:07,487 --> 01:10:08,330
Scott: oh I know all these songs.

1232
01:10:08,410 --> 01:10:15,650
Rym: It's funny because freeze-pop was a band that was basically catapulted to newfound success like a re success because of these games.

1233
01:10:15,730 --> 01:10:16,434
Scott: But they know it.

1234
01:10:16,756 --> 01:10:18,726
Scott: It's not like it was like, you know, oh, we're not.

1235
01:10:18,746 --> 01:10:19,550
Scott: we're trying to avoid it.

1236
01:10:19,570 --> 01:10:21,101
Scott: It's like they know it and they embrace it.

1237
01:10:21,121 --> 01:10:22,370
Scott: They're like, yeah, we know that we're.

1238
01:10:23,895 --> 01:10:24,216
Rym: They like.

1239
01:10:24,497 --> 01:10:28,090
Rym: it was very heartfelt when they pointed out that look you guys had packs like people like you.

1240
01:10:28,795 --> 01:10:34,350
Rym: You made us happen Mm-hmm, but now I'm glad people know who they were.

1241
01:10:34,891 --> 01:10:38,321
Rym: You know early on like like I'd say six months before packs.

1242
01:10:38,722 --> 01:10:41,470
Rym: I only knew freeze-bop as that band that did.

1243
01:10:45,872 --> 01:10:49,310
Scott: Alex said he didn't know who they were until they played that song which of course is the last one they played.

1244
01:10:51,391 --> 01:11:03,007
Scott: But anyway, yeah, so Paul and storm come out and I didn't really know who they were at all But I knew that they were obviously Some sort of geeky and awesome people because they they sang with emcee front lot a little bit.

1245
01:11:03,147 --> 01:11:04,090
Scott: Yeah the previous night.

1246
01:11:04,170 --> 01:11:04,733
Scott: So I'm like, huh?

1247
01:11:05,114 --> 01:11:06,419
Scott: I wonder what how those people do.

1248
01:11:06,479 --> 01:11:07,785
Scott: I don't know any of their songs.

1249
01:11:07,905 --> 01:11:09,130
Rym: I enjoyed them thoroughly.

1250
01:11:09,331 --> 01:11:10,615
Scott: They were like the best.

1251
01:11:10,675 --> 01:11:12,219
Scott: I mean like Jonathan Colton was awesome.

1252
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:13,463
Scott: But like I knew his stuff.

1253
01:11:13,925 --> 01:11:16,654
Scott: so like Paul and storm I didn't know their stuff.

1254
01:11:17,016 --> 01:11:18,060
Scott: So it was like oh shit.

1255
01:11:18,081 --> 01:11:18,804
Scott: This is fucking great.

1256
01:11:19,286 --> 01:11:20,250
Rym: I'm gonna do everything.

1257
01:11:20,311 --> 01:11:21,689
Rym: I want to see if they'll do an anime con.

1258
01:11:21,971 --> 01:11:26,590
Scott: They're gonna be in New Haven with Jonathan Colton in the relatively near future.

1259
01:11:26,610 --> 01:11:29,930
Rym: No, I'm going to do everything in my power to get them to come to Connecticut.

1260
01:11:30,970 --> 01:11:32,055
Rym: Imagine that fuck.

1261
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:34,546
Rym: Yeah, that would be like the biggest thing ever.

1262
01:11:34,607 --> 01:11:36,113
Rym: Yes I don't know.

1263
01:11:36,213 --> 01:11:36,775
Rym: I gotta try.

1264
01:11:36,835 --> 01:11:39,184
Scott: but Joe Cohen and Paul storm in Connecticut.

1265
01:11:39,224 --> 01:11:40,850
Rym: Joe would probably like Connecticut.

1266
01:11:40,951 --> 01:11:42,499
Scott: He's it lives in Brooklyn.

1267
01:11:42,519 --> 01:11:42,881
Scott: Why doesn't he?

1268
01:11:42,901 --> 01:11:43,706
Scott: you know, he'd come on over.

1269
01:11:43,826 --> 01:11:44,430
Scott: We'll work on it.

1270
01:11:44,510 --> 01:11:49,210
Rym: Yeah, but the thing is with Paul and storm is like some of their bits were funnier than other bits.

1271
01:11:49,712 --> 01:11:54,670
Rym: But the bit where they were doing like they were basically doing impressions of other musicians.

1272
01:11:56,214 --> 01:11:57,558
Rym: That was like the funniest thing they did.

1273
01:11:57,698 --> 01:11:58,520
Scott: song was awesome.

1274
01:11:58,641 --> 01:12:07,550
Rym: Oh, there's also every time they did something for the ladies They definitely combine the filthy kind of songs with the stagemanship.

1275
01:12:07,630 --> 01:12:11,810
Scott: Well, I mean, that's the thing is the most problem with filk is that filk usually means no talent.

1276
01:12:11,810 --> 01:12:14,755
Scott: You know one thing that I realized That was a burn.

1277
01:12:14,855 --> 01:12:33,650
Scott: one thing I realized is that all the musicians that they had at PAX this year We're like like I didn't really fully realize like the at the crazy high levels of musical talent that were present on the stage Like the dude like emcee front lots bassist like also played guitar also played the kazoo very very well.

1278
01:12:34,095 --> 01:12:34,824
Scott: you know, it's like.

1279
01:12:35,873 --> 01:12:38,745
Scott: Paul and storm are obviously incredibly musically talented.

1280
01:12:38,785 --> 01:12:39,929
Scott: They could play all sorts of stuff.

1281
01:12:40,472 --> 01:12:43,950
Scott: You know, it was just sort of like, you know how talented all these people were.

1282
01:12:44,139 --> 01:12:45,276
Scott: You know You could tell.

1283
01:12:45,336 --> 01:12:47,530
Scott: I could tell like I I'm not musically talented.

1284
01:12:47,892 --> 01:12:50,828
Scott: I can tell by the pics, but I can tell musical talent when I see it.

1285
01:12:51,371 --> 01:12:54,870
Rym: But the thing about Paul and storm, you know what they really remind me of Dana Carvey.

1286
01:12:54,990 --> 01:12:57,056
Rym: It's the musical stand-up act you think.

1287
01:12:57,096 --> 01:13:02,270
Rym: so musical stand-up is so wonderful because I think a Dana Carvey plus Simon and Garfunkel.

1288
01:13:02,310 --> 01:13:06,530
Rym: How rare is it to have someone who is both musically talented and comedically talented?

1289
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:07,873
Scott: Yeah, kinda.

1290
01:13:08,395 --> 01:13:10,081
Rym: I mean Paul and storm.

1291
01:13:10,342 --> 01:13:11,848
Rym: I look forward to seeing you guys in the future.

1292
01:13:11,868 --> 01:13:21,153
Rym: You guys were great And I got download all their musics and of course Joko the fact that Paul and storm sang backup vocals for Joko like Joko Turned together.

1293
01:13:21,214 --> 01:13:29,321
Rym: So it's sort of like, you know, Joko basically does the same set and like every year Like it was the exact same thing - the Rick roll Yep, and he didn't got Rick rolled by the audience instead.

1294
01:13:29,381 --> 01:13:30,205
Rym: That was so beautiful.

1295
01:13:30,225 --> 01:13:31,310
Scott: Then he's like, yeah, I deserve this.

1296
01:13:31,390 --> 01:13:33,297
Rym: He comes out everyone share the car gets quiet.

1297
01:13:33,518 --> 01:13:37,941
Scott: One thing is that last year it seemed like John, you know, obviously, you know This is probably not true.

1298
01:13:37,962 --> 01:13:44,074
Scott: But at least Jonathan Coulton's presence on stage last year was sort of like, you know, yeah, I'm doing the concert All right this year.

1299
01:13:44,114 --> 01:13:47,230
Scott: He was like smiling and he couldn't like contain himself this year.

1300
01:13:47,391 --> 01:13:49,529
Scott: So, you know that was a much awesome.

1301
01:13:49,751 --> 01:13:50,272
Rym: But what you know?

1302
01:13:50,292 --> 01:13:57,250
Rym: the audience gets quiet and before he can start singing and suddenly you're all these people yelling in the background And then you realize that they're all in unison.

1303
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:05,950
Rym: It was beautiful Yeah, but he basically did the same set he did last year and I have a feeling that he does the same set at every.

1304
01:14:06,834 --> 01:14:08,341
Scott: You know, when is he had a new song?

1305
01:14:08,401 --> 01:14:09,024
Scott: that's a reason.

1306
01:14:09,064 --> 01:14:11,035
Rym: come on Joe co-writers new songs But he's probably right.

1307
01:14:11,075 --> 01:14:22,195
Rym: him now while it was basically the same set He had Paul and storm singing backup vocals with him And that made it like was like all the songs over again because it added so much I had Molly the girl do.

1308
01:14:22,215 --> 01:14:23,661
Rym: clearly that was really good.

1309
01:14:23,721 --> 01:14:25,909
Rym: Ooh lay lay ooh, coo lay lay.

1310
01:14:27,573 --> 01:14:29,110
Rym: Does anyone get that joke, maybe?

1311
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:41,209
Rym: I All started when I drink 40 glasses of money as a side packs is great because I can make inside Baseball jokes about gaming and like three quarters the audience will get it.

1312
01:14:41,731 --> 01:14:46,028
Rym: I make anime jokes about recent anime at Otakon and no one has any idea what I'm talking about.

1313
01:14:46,269 --> 01:14:47,332
Scott: Yep Let's see.

1314
01:14:47,372 --> 01:14:48,074
Scott: What are we?

1315
01:14:48,134 --> 01:14:51,362
Scott: are we winding down here pretty much on Saturday at least.

1316
01:14:51,562 --> 01:14:54,470
Rym: Yeah, so Sunday Sunday we couldn't Seattle.

1317
01:14:54,871 --> 01:14:58,990
Rym: I love you, but you do not have the breakfast that you we can get in New York.

1318
01:14:59,110 --> 01:15:04,766
Scott: Yeah, you have crepes, but you don't have like fucking bagels or there's like one bagel place.

1319
01:15:04,787 --> 01:15:05,990
Scott: That's like down by the water.

1320
01:15:06,070 --> 01:15:08,359
Scott: That's hard to get to and wasn't open when we needed to be open.

1321
01:15:08,479 --> 01:15:09,904
Rym: However, what Seattle does?

1322
01:15:10,125 --> 01:15:11,450
Scott: where the fucking breakfast sandwiches?

1323
01:15:11,710 --> 01:15:13,690
Scott: Yeah, basically need a bacon egg and cheese on a croissant.

1324
01:15:13,790 --> 01:15:16,400
Rym: The only quick breakfast we could get was at the bodega.

1325
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:18,648
Rym: I had a can of Red Bull and a KitKat for breakfast.

1326
01:15:18,708 --> 01:15:23,090
Scott: on morning I went to a deli and I got three pancakes for three dollars is fucking awesome.

1327
01:15:23,110 --> 01:15:28,584
Rym: You know what I can say in New York while it was a KitKat and Red Bull breakfast It was a white chocolate KitKat.

1328
01:15:28,604 --> 01:15:29,249
Rym: We don't get that shit.

1329
01:15:29,351 --> 01:15:29,809
Scott: You know what?

1330
01:15:29,950 --> 01:15:34,230
Scott: We went to that the Mexican place in the mall and we got an orange juice and a quesadilla for breakfast.

1331
01:15:34,310 --> 01:15:35,555
Scott: That was actually a really good breakfast.

1332
01:15:35,595 --> 01:15:36,579
Scott: that totally revived me.

1333
01:15:36,739 --> 01:15:39,590
Rym: However, why does that place not have breakfast burritos?

1334
01:15:40,050 --> 01:15:41,420
Scott: He could have gotten a burrito burrito.

1335
01:15:41,441 --> 01:15:42,589
Rym: That was too much.

1336
01:15:42,750 --> 01:15:48,290
Scott: Yeah, I needed like the egg salsa burrito with some cheese and some peppers and onion.

1337
01:15:48,290 --> 01:15:49,277
Scott: That would have been a fucking.

1338
01:15:49,298 --> 01:15:56,490
Rym: but we get into the convention Early with our badges to go set up for beyond D&D because this is 10 fucking a.m People are already lined up.

1339
01:15:56,551 --> 01:15:57,604
Scott: I don't know how the hell they got in there.

1340
01:15:57,625 --> 01:16:09,690
Rym: people snuck into the con before they were supposed to and got in line for beyond D&D with normal attendee badges and the Enforcers to their credit who were at the room did not kick them out did not say hey, how'd you get in?

1341
01:16:09,810 --> 01:16:11,107
Scott: They were like, all right.

1342
01:16:13,339 --> 01:16:14,789
Scott: Yeah, the room did not fill.

1343
01:16:15,754 --> 01:16:21,030
Scott: But the room, you know It started out about half full and then the rest sort of filled in as the panel went on.

1344
01:16:21,130 --> 01:16:22,960
Scott: I can't blame people for not showing up.

1345
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:24,227
Scott: It was about 10 a.m.

1346
01:16:24,347 --> 01:16:24,870
Scott: On Sunday.

1347
01:16:24,950 --> 01:16:29,387
Rym: It was about 75% full when we started and it was about 90% full by the time we ended.

1348
01:16:29,628 --> 01:16:30,130
Scott: Yeah, it was good.

1349
01:16:30,693 --> 01:16:31,276
Scott: It wasn't a bet.

1350
01:16:31,336 --> 01:16:38,309
Rym: None of our panels had a bad turnout, you know, yeah I mean it was we had more people there than we got at anything in Connecticut, but we ran beyond D&D.

1351
01:16:38,911 --> 01:16:41,000
Scott: It was a pretty difficult running of the end.

1352
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:41,823
Rym: I was a little tired.

1353
01:16:41,884 --> 01:16:42,124
Rym: I got.

1354
01:16:42,165 --> 01:16:43,450
Rym: I got sidetracked once or twice.

1355
01:16:43,530 --> 01:16:46,923
Rym: We were definitely not fully on game, but Scott was on fire with the jokes.

1356
01:16:47,244 --> 01:16:48,690
Rym: He made up for me being so tired.

1357
01:16:48,932 --> 01:16:50,470
Scott: Hey, we let's see.

1358
01:16:50,751 --> 01:16:51,737
Scott: And then right.

1359
01:16:51,757 --> 01:17:01,370
Scott: so here's the awesome thing is that we noticed when we arrived To the beyond D&D that one of the panels in the room They basically have black tape and they tape over panels when they're done

1360
01:17:02,033 --> 01:17:02,114
Rym: We

1361
01:17:02,174 --> 01:17:07,640
Scott: noticed that one of the panels in the middle of the day like 1 p.m On Sunday was taped over even though it didn't happen yet.

1362
01:17:07,881 --> 01:17:10,490
Scott: I don't even know a panel it was so it was cancelled.

1363
01:17:10,591 --> 01:17:12,030
Rym: I'm like, okay, so we're in the room.

1364
01:17:12,050 --> 01:17:16,790
Scott: We got our awesome enforcer in the room and Jared Sorensen is like I want to do action castle.

1365
01:17:16,911 --> 01:17:20,186
Scott: So suddenly I'm like one of the panels in this room is canceled.

1366
01:17:20,206 --> 01:17:21,170
Rym: Yep, so we go to the enforcer.

1367
01:17:21,170 --> 01:17:23,804
Rym: We're like, hey, is there really nothing in this room at one o'clock?

1368
01:17:23,824 --> 01:17:24,930
Rym: and he's like as far as we know.

1369
01:17:25,010 --> 01:17:26,760
Rym: No, we're like we have something crazy.

1370
01:17:26,860 --> 01:17:27,061
Rym: Awesome.

1371
01:17:27,081 --> 01:17:28,046
Rym: You could run just trust us.

1372
01:17:28,107 --> 01:17:28,589
Rym: Give us the room.

1373
01:17:29,111 --> 01:17:30,114
Scott: So they call up.

1374
01:17:30,254 --> 01:17:35,448
Scott: Khalil white is someone we've interacted with frequently, but never actually met and he shows up.

1375
01:17:35,589 --> 01:17:39,944
Rym: finally Yeah, because they're like, yeah, it's no this would never happen at any other con.

1376
01:17:40,406 --> 01:17:41,530
Rym: This is why Pax is awesome.

1377
01:17:41,913 --> 01:17:44,069
Scott: Of course, he shows up and he's the awesomest dude.

1378
01:17:45,172 --> 01:17:47,019
Rym: So basically the enforcers are like this is totally cool.

1379
01:17:47,039 --> 01:17:48,626
Rym: we just have to make sure that mr.

1380
01:17:48,666 --> 01:17:49,570
Rym: White is okay with it.

1381
01:17:49,953 --> 01:17:54,030
Rym: so he shows up just for the panel and I'm very pleased to meet him in person.

1382
01:17:54,091 --> 01:17:55,249
Rym: But he basically said you know what?

1383
01:17:55,930 --> 01:18:02,734
Rym: It's really stupid that we haven't talked in person before this and we're gonna be talking to him about Pax East Very shortly.

1384
01:18:02,754 --> 01:18:09,090
Rym: He works for read exhibitions managing the Pax East and West and yes Apparently his office is like right next to Pete to Tara who we work with.

1385
01:18:10,750 --> 01:18:13,319
Rym: Yeah, so Pax East is gonna be crazy.

1386
01:18:13,459 --> 01:18:21,548
Rym: awesome because we like we have some insight into things They're planning on doing and we have avenues to get people to do them better and cheaper.

1387
01:18:21,829 --> 01:18:24,178
Rym: Yeah So anyway, that was awesome.

1388
01:18:24,198 --> 01:18:25,061
Rym: And of course we had Jerry.

1389
01:18:25,081 --> 01:18:28,605
Scott: of course, he let us have the room at 1 p.m For the action castle.

1390
01:18:28,808 --> 01:18:35,817
Rym: Yep So we had Jared and Luke in the room and they stood up and waved and then we told every basically This panel that was not in the schedule.

1391
01:18:36,139 --> 01:18:39,710
Rym: we managed to get a lot of people to show up for this panel.

1392
01:18:39,770 --> 01:18:40,657
Rym: That was not scheduled.

1393
01:18:40,757 --> 01:18:41,825
Scott: Yeah, we did the tweets.

1394
01:18:41,945 --> 01:18:42,590
Scott: everyone tweeted.

1395
01:18:42,871 --> 01:18:48,930
Rym: I walked into every tabletop room and I was like, alright guys this game come play a game with us in the theater.

1396
01:18:49,492 --> 01:18:53,664
Rym: Yep, and we had a lot of people to show up and Jared ran action castle.

1397
01:18:53,704 --> 01:18:56,474
Rym: now while we were waiting for this to happen There was some downtime.

1398
01:18:56,494 --> 01:18:58,603
Rym: So between the two we played Citadel's.

1399
01:18:58,644 --> 01:19:00,030
Rym: we taught some people how to play this game.

1400
01:19:00,050 --> 01:19:01,135
Scott: We didn't finish that game though.

1401
01:19:01,697 --> 01:19:04,570
Rym: while that game was going on I randomly ran into gave in Tyco.

1402
01:19:05,051 --> 01:19:11,157
Rym: Yeah, Scott was in the room and I was on my way to the bodega and someone tasked me on the shoulder and they're like Hey, can you take a picture for us?

1403
01:19:11,177 --> 01:19:11,519
Rym: I'm like up.

1404
01:19:11,700 --> 01:19:13,190
Rym: Okay, and then I turn around.

1405
01:19:13,271 --> 01:19:15,169
Rym: I realized that standing in front of me or gave in Tyco.

1406
01:19:16,212 --> 01:19:24,230
Rym: So I took a picture of gave in Tyco and some guy Alright, and then you know, I talked to him for a little bit and Tyco, you know, Jerry unsolicited is you know, I'm like.

1407
01:19:24,511 --> 01:19:29,812
Rym: Oh, yeah, I ran the beyond D&D last year and we're running stuff this year and he's like, oh, yeah You know what?

1408
01:19:30,133 --> 01:19:35,638
Rym: I heard there was some mouse guard going on on at this con and I was like, yeah It happened on Saturday.

1409
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:35,981
Rym: Sadly.

1410
01:19:36,001 --> 01:19:36,928
Rym: He's like, ah, damn.

1411
01:19:38,252 --> 01:19:40,623
Rym: But then you know, I couldn't bother them.

1412
01:19:40,643 --> 01:19:41,950
Rym: They're obviously on their way somewhere.

1413
01:19:42,010 --> 01:19:49,384
Rym: so I congratulated him on forming babby and then I let him get on his way and Luke and Jared kind of bump in and Luke's like blah blah blah blah blah and invite.

1414
01:19:49,404 --> 01:19:54,869
Rym: they invite those two guys to come to Action castle and to their credit Jerry pulls out a schedule.

1415
01:19:55,191 --> 01:19:57,343
Rym: They probably the schedule that Robert coup gave to him.

1416
01:19:57,383 --> 01:19:58,630
Rym: He's like don't deviate from this.

1417
01:19:58,810 --> 01:20:02,990
Scott: Yeah, actually no Robert coup looks like now cuz I actually saw him a few times at the convention.

1418
01:20:03,111 --> 01:20:09,949
Rym: Yeah, I can't stop him though because he was a busy man I kept running into him and every time I was like I want to bother you but just go on your way.

1419
01:20:11,330 --> 01:20:15,950
Rym: But he pulls out his schedule and he looks at it and he has something circled at one o'clock.

1420
01:20:15,990 --> 01:20:16,895
Rym: She's like, ah, I can't go.

1421
01:20:16,915 --> 01:20:19,065
Rym: Yeah, but I see later.

1422
01:20:19,105 --> 01:20:20,030
Rym: Hey Steve Jackson's back.

1423
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:20,892
Rym: So I go to Jared.

1424
01:20:20,912 --> 01:20:23,901
Rym: on the Jared go invite Steve Jackson to your action castle.

1425
01:20:24,303 --> 01:20:24,744
Rym: and he did.

1426
01:20:24,764 --> 01:20:28,967
Rym: and Steve Jackson came to Action castle, uh, what did he come to?

1427
01:20:30,158 --> 01:20:32,396
Rym: Action Castle, that's correct.

1428
01:20:32,898 --> 01:20:34,062
Scott: He came to the action castle.

1429
01:20:34,223 --> 01:20:36,090
Rym: Oh my god action castle was so crazy.

1430
01:20:36,170 --> 01:20:40,146
Scott: And again, you know, my plan was to grief the action castle and Jared's like.

1431
01:20:40,166 --> 01:20:41,110
Scott: you can't grief it right?

1432
01:20:41,290 --> 01:20:42,355
Scott: All you get is like one move.

1433
01:20:42,576 --> 01:20:43,581
Scott: What's the worst you can do?

1434
01:20:43,621 --> 01:20:45,470
Scott: like go up the tree and down the tree again?

1435
01:20:45,530 --> 01:20:50,209
Scott: It's like, you know go backwards, you know, you can kill self you can restart but you can't really.

1436
01:20:50,229 --> 01:20:51,616
Scott: you know You can't do that much damage.

1437
01:20:52,198 --> 01:20:54,690
Rym: So I see Scott, you know, I didn't play I just took pictures of the audience.

1438
01:20:54,951 --> 01:21:00,810
Rym: I see Scott like standing there like on a mission and he gets up there and he's like drop lamp, right?

1439
01:21:00,990 --> 01:21:03,118
Scott: So the thing is from playing action castle.

1440
01:21:03,158 --> 01:21:06,110
Scott: before I knew that you start with a lamp in your inventory.

1441
01:21:06,650 --> 01:21:10,153
Scott: Nobody in the whole game had checked the inventory yet So no one else knew.

1442
01:21:10,173 --> 01:21:15,808
Scott: so I go up there and I drop lamp and Jared makes a face and he's just like he says You drop the lamp.

1443
01:21:16,770 --> 01:21:20,986
Scott: Nobody picked up the lamp and they went all the way to action gasps.

1444
01:21:21,026 --> 01:21:23,790
Rym: In fact, they got so far They saved the game without the lamp.

1445
01:21:23,850 --> 01:21:26,083
Scott: They saved the game in the princesses chambers.

1446
01:21:26,385 --> 01:21:27,270
Scott: They didn't have the lamp.

1447
01:21:27,792 --> 01:21:32,130
Scott: They had to go all the way back and get the lamp and then all the way back again.

1448
01:21:32,310 --> 01:21:35,664
Scott: And then when I got my I only had two turns because there were a lot of people in line.

1449
01:21:36,226 --> 01:21:38,739
Scott: on my second turn I climbed the tree.

1450
01:21:38,759 --> 01:21:45,895
Scott: It took a long time Just because I could and we had to go up the tree and down the tree Though the cool thing was.

1451
01:21:45,915 --> 01:21:47,180
Rym: this is why Pax is so great.

1452
01:21:47,220 --> 01:21:49,568
Rym: Why the enforcers are so great the dude.

1453
01:21:49,629 --> 01:21:50,813
Rym: I'm sorry I forgot your name.

1454
01:21:50,833 --> 01:21:55,490
Rym: You're like my best friend who was like right like all these people running the Raven the Raven theater managers.

1455
01:21:55,932 --> 01:21:57,236
Scott: Yeah, those guys are the best.

1456
01:21:57,296 --> 01:21:58,079
Rym: He was like, okay.

1457
01:21:58,200 --> 01:21:59,665
Rym: What does action castle entail?

1458
01:22:00,046 --> 01:22:01,050
Rym: We told we explained it to him.

1459
01:22:01,050 --> 01:22:12,093
Rym: We didn't you know normally wait like if we're at Otakon and we need like something special We basically have to like explicitly explain like this then this then this then this then this forever and even then they'll still cock it Up here.

1460
01:22:12,535 --> 01:22:16,590
Rym: All we did was explain what action castle was and he was like, so they'll line up in front of the mic.

1461
01:22:16,731 --> 01:22:17,275
Rym: We're like, yep.

1462
01:22:17,517 --> 01:22:19,190
Rym: He's like got it and he walks away.

1463
01:22:20,014 --> 01:22:20,296
Scott: He

1464
01:22:20,417 --> 01:22:34,889
Rym: took the line turn style style Through the chairs lined up at the back of the room and formed the entire line inside the room and he had everyone who already Did their turn walk out the exit at the front and get in line at the back of the room again?

1465
01:22:35,632 --> 01:22:42,327
Rym: He came up with this on his own Immediately and all the other enforcers made it happen and he didn't need to ask anyone for permission either.

1466
01:22:42,367 --> 01:22:42,949
Scott: He just did it.

1467
01:22:43,371 --> 01:22:44,356
Rym: Oh my god packs.

1468
01:22:44,376 --> 01:22:46,144
Rym: You're like you guys seriously.

1469
01:22:46,224 --> 01:22:47,490
Rym: I cannot give you enough props.

1470
01:22:47,590 --> 01:22:57,466
Scott: Enforcers are like something so simple but yet compared to the others such a big deal and it's all that little simple shit That makes the con 10,000 times the awesome you who take up the black.

1471
01:22:57,607 --> 01:23:01,770
Rym: I salute you But we've got the line and I see Steve Jackson in line.

1472
01:23:01,871 --> 01:23:05,546
Rym: He came he's in line and he is clearly having a great time Yep.

1473
01:23:05,991 --> 01:23:18,178
Rym: So he is one person away from taking his turn and the dude in front of him walks up with that grief Look and says reset game resetting and Welcome to action.

1474
01:23:18,218 --> 01:23:20,550
Rym: gas and Jared looks at Steve Jackson.

1475
01:23:20,710 --> 01:23:27,430
Rym: She actually looks at him and they both shake their heads and Steve Jackson says load save slot one now loading.

1476
01:23:29,312 --> 01:23:30,036
Rym: And then he did.

1477
01:23:30,056 --> 01:23:32,850
Rym: I wonder how many people in the room realized that was Steve Jackson.

1478
01:23:33,372 --> 01:23:34,337
Scott: I don't know.

1479
01:23:34,457 --> 01:23:40,926
Rym: people even know Steve Jackson is one thing I can say Steve Jackson But he tweeted later and he was like action castle was amazing.

1480
01:23:40,946 --> 01:23:43,577
Scott: Yep Totally awesome.

1481
01:23:43,718 --> 01:23:45,370
Scott: No, it's like super wicked awesome.

1482
01:23:45,470 --> 01:23:49,926
Rym: It was really interesting to run action castle or to see it run for a group of gamers.

1483
01:23:49,966 --> 01:24:03,961
Rym: cuz you know Jared ran it for us at Connecticut, which was mostly non gamers and Like the crowd was in one way worse at action castle because they didn't understand text adventures But in many ways much better because they weren't jerk griefers.

1484
01:24:04,002 --> 01:24:06,750
Scott: They didn't even think just they were just playing it straightforwardly.

1485
01:24:06,790 --> 01:24:08,782
Scott: They didn't know any text adventure stuff.

1486
01:24:08,803 --> 01:24:09,990
Scott: They didn't know to save and load.

1487
01:24:10,271 --> 01:24:12,545
Scott: They only knew to save because Pete told them that.

1488
01:24:12,585 --> 01:24:13,490
Scott: you know, Pete gave it away.

1489
01:24:13,611 --> 01:24:24,089
Rym: It's interesting how the people who had played a lot of games were proud like their prior experience hurt them in action castle because they they had these preconceived notions and it was really interesting.

1490
01:24:24,470 --> 01:24:26,759
Rym: and Jared and I talked about that a lot after action castle.

1491
01:24:26,819 --> 01:24:29,088
Rym: Yes, very very interesting, but it took 30 minutes.

1492
01:24:29,168 --> 01:24:29,710
Rym: the game ended.

1493
01:24:29,771 --> 01:24:34,082
Rym: They won with the score I believe 98 out of 100 because they didn't give the rose to the princess.

1494
01:24:34,223 --> 01:24:38,985
Scott: after they they gave her the rose to the princess But they didn't do it again after loading the game.

1495
01:24:39,005 --> 01:24:47,416
Rym: So yeah yep, but and After it all, you know, we had a half hour left in the room and instead of you know Kicking us out or whatever.

1496
01:24:47,476 --> 01:24:50,330
Rym: The enforcer was like you guys got the room for a half hour.

1497
01:24:50,451 --> 01:24:51,558
Rym: Got it want to do anything cool.

1498
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:53,389
Scott: So we just took questions for half hour.

1499
01:24:53,631 --> 01:25:00,330
Rym: So me Jared and Scott we sat down and we had by then, you know Other people were like don't stay unless you have nothing better to do seriously.

1500
01:25:00,490 --> 01:25:06,930
Rym: So only about 60 people stayed and we're like, alright, we can take like three or four questions.

1501
01:25:07,613 --> 01:25:09,501
Rym: Do not use semi-colons in your question.

1502
01:25:09,541 --> 01:25:11,248
Rym: don't make a statement to ask a good question.

1503
01:25:11,288 --> 01:25:13,490
Rym: Seriously We'll totally get all great questions.

1504
01:25:13,791 --> 01:25:15,376
Scott: The greatest question was the guy who was like.

1505
01:25:15,738 --> 01:25:21,259
Scott: you play all this wide variety of games and I'm like I'm about to explain Oh how I play this wide variety of guy.

1506
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:21,982
Scott: He's like no.

1507
01:25:22,042 --> 01:25:23,127
Scott: No, my question is right.

1508
01:25:23,850 --> 01:25:30,001
Scott: So I was answering the wrong question first of all and then he's like, you know where is there still room for gaming to grow?

1509
01:25:30,062 --> 01:25:31,709
Scott: and I was like, oh man, what a great question.

1510
01:25:31,729 --> 01:25:35,118
Scott: and Actually, we talked about the unfulfilled potential.

1511
01:25:35,139 --> 01:25:38,090
Rym: Yep, and it gave me a bunch of ideas for panels, too.

1512
01:25:38,190 --> 01:25:44,853
Rym: So dude, if you're listening email us and tell us who you were because you realize you inspired three brand new panels that we're gonna Do at cons?

1513
01:25:44,954 --> 01:25:46,180
Scott: Yeah, it's a very good question.

1514
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:48,350
Rym: Like the unresolved potential is going to be a whole panel.

1515
01:25:48,390 --> 01:25:50,799
Rym: That's basically going to be why Nintendo build potential.

1516
01:25:50,879 --> 01:25:51,160
Rym: Yes.

1517
01:25:51,180 --> 01:25:53,830
Rym: Yep, but we did this panel.

1518
01:25:53,850 --> 01:25:56,390
Rym: It was really fun and I got to say I want to do one.

1519
01:25:56,450 --> 01:25:59,130
Rym: I want to get Jared and Luke to do like their own panels at cons.

1520
01:26:00,355 --> 01:26:07,130
Rym: Doing a Q&A roundtable with Jared Sorenson was really cool because He has insights that we do not see and we agree.

1521
01:26:07,130 --> 01:26:12,621
Rym: You know We disagree on a lot of big points in gaming But it amazes me how much we agree on.

1522
01:26:12,661 --> 01:26:19,246
Rym: that doesn't come up when we normally talk because we don't talk about the things we Agree on but then someone asks us a question and we all like have the same answer.

1523
01:26:19,266 --> 01:26:20,130
Scott: I know right?

1524
01:26:21,490 --> 01:26:21,792
Scott: Let's see.

1525
01:26:21,812 --> 01:26:24,208
Scott: Let's talk about a bunch of little shit that's going on.

1526
01:26:24,268 --> 01:26:24,490
Scott: Let's see.

1527
01:26:24,550 --> 01:26:26,901
Scott: Oh, we bought some PAX merch before they sold out.

1528
01:26:27,001 --> 01:26:27,162
Rym: Yep.

1529
01:26:27,202 --> 01:26:28,006
Rym: We got the PAX 2009 t-shirt.

1530
01:26:29,591 --> 01:26:41,910
Rym: I'll say this again, you know way before we asked for I still I owe the two people who sent me those pit boy puppets Crazy prizes and someday I'll get them to you and I'll prop you again on the show and you'll probably you forgot all about it.

1531
01:26:41,970 --> 01:26:44,479
Rym: But we got paxo 9 t-shirts.

1532
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:47,610
Rym: We were unable to get packs away t-shirts because they sold out like right away.

1533
01:26:48,391 --> 01:26:52,229
Rym: I don't think I'm going to ask for a PAX t-shirt though because it would have been a pre-worn one.

1534
01:26:52,634 --> 01:26:53,404
Scott: Yeah, I don't want that.

1535
01:26:53,546 --> 01:27:03,986
Scott: Nah I See there were like famous people there like like Bill Amand had a table that the Foxtrot guy We didn't talk to him because you know, there was no line because he was like I was like in it.

1536
01:27:04,107 --> 01:27:06,730
Rym: say to him though I will I know we stood there.

1537
01:27:06,750 --> 01:27:06,971
Rym: We're like.

1538
01:27:06,992 --> 01:27:09,607
Rym: does anyone have anything to say them other than other than like fan stuff?

1539
01:27:09,627 --> 01:27:10,592
Rym: and we're like no So we own away.

1540
01:27:10,632 --> 01:27:15,630
Rym: but one thing dude looks almost exactly like the way he draws Jason if you look at him from the side.

1541
01:27:15,814 --> 01:27:20,644
Scott: Oh for reals Like Jonan Vasquez is there but I don't know what he looks like.

1542
01:27:20,765 --> 01:27:21,166
Scott: and he wasn't.

1543
01:27:21,186 --> 01:27:22,050
Scott: he was just an attendee.

1544
01:27:22,110 --> 01:27:24,429
Scott: He wasn't like as far as I could tell doing anything special.

1545
01:27:24,872 --> 01:27:25,153
Scott: So it's like.

1546
01:27:25,193 --> 01:27:31,136
Scott: how would I even know I could've been playing a game with him and not even know one thing and I'm gonna I got it If I don't get a hold of him.

1547
01:27:31,316 --> 01:27:34,949
Rym: everyone everyone talked to Jonathan Colton in whatever way you can.

1548
01:27:35,771 --> 01:27:40,870
Rym: One of our things the day from the long time from a long time ago was called a story from North America.

1549
01:27:41,193 --> 01:27:43,151
Rym: Yeah, we were going to show it to him Like.

1550
01:27:43,171 --> 01:27:45,218
Rym: I wanted to show it to him on my pre and be like.

1551
01:27:45,980 --> 01:27:48,810
Rym: you can do something cool with this you if anyone.

1552
01:27:49,733 --> 01:27:53,530
Rym: But you know he was gone on Sunday And I didn't get a chance to talk to him before the concert on Saturday.

1553
01:27:53,651 --> 01:27:56,310
Rym: So I want him to see this and do something cool with it.

1554
01:27:56,350 --> 01:27:57,776
Rym: So help me out people out there.

1555
01:27:58,016 --> 01:28:01,530
Scott: the NS guys from unknown worlds are supposed to have a booth totally bailed.

1556
01:28:01,711 --> 01:28:05,807
Scott: They didn't and that sucked because that was something I was looking forward to and it wasn't there.

1557
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:06,430
Scott: so fuck though.

1558
01:28:06,671 --> 01:28:07,254
Scott: No, fuck them.

1559
01:28:07,294 --> 01:28:08,038
Scott: No, not great.

1560
01:28:08,078 --> 01:28:09,566
Scott: But come on guys.

1561
01:28:09,646 --> 01:28:10,149
Scott: What the hell?

1562
01:28:11,210 --> 01:28:13,560
Scott: Seriously, I wanted to see you then again.

1563
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:14,985
Rym: Hopefully they'll be at PAX East.

1564
01:28:15,146 --> 01:28:32,750
Scott: Hopefully we'll see Oh before one of our panels these guys who are making a mod like an expansion or something for dawn of war 2 were there and Basically dawn of war 2 is that Warhammer RTS that I had a hard time with because it was basically just a million times rock-paper-scissors.

1565
01:28:33,811 --> 01:28:38,047
Scott: But apparently what these guys have made is they made a defense mode.

1566
01:28:38,287 --> 01:28:38,970
Scott: That's co-op.

1567
01:28:39,070 --> 01:28:42,309
Scott: So it's like co-op defense dawn of war and I thought that was pretty cool.

1568
01:28:42,892 --> 01:28:47,710
Scott: So that's like wow if the game was that from the get-go, I probably would have played it a lot more All right.

1569
01:28:47,750 --> 01:28:54,496
Rym: So after beyond D&D we met this guy on Matt Youngmark and we talked to him a little bit and he writes choose your own Adventure books.

1570
01:28:54,979 --> 01:28:56,510
Scott: Oh, yeah that guy totally awesome.

1571
01:28:56,611 --> 01:29:02,249
Rym: I was reading though when he gave us a free copy of zombocalypse now Which is one of them and I gotta say it's pretty great.

1572
01:29:02,621 --> 01:29:09,161
Rym: Yeah Like it brings back all that fun and choose your own adventures in a big way and he's also like a cool gamer guy Like we talked to him for a while.

1573
01:29:09,181 --> 01:29:12,178
Scott: Mm-hmm Pretty much everyone we talked to.

1574
01:29:12,198 --> 01:29:19,657
Scott: like I just walk up to random people and start talking to him Like I would just like I'd see people in the game room and I just go up to him Like there are two people playing.

1575
01:29:19,677 --> 01:29:24,102
Scott: block is like we sat down to play that hive game And I saw the two people across through him were playing.

1576
01:29:24,123 --> 01:29:25,510
Scott: block is and I just sort of looked at him.

1577
01:29:25,510 --> 01:29:29,169
Scott: I'm like, ah block is and they're like they picked their head up like, huh?

1578
01:29:29,550 --> 01:29:32,328
Scott: Then after he finished the hive game, I just walk over like I'm like block is.

1579
01:29:32,348 --> 01:29:35,959
Rym: let's go In general like packs far in a way.

1580
01:29:36,039 --> 01:29:39,150
Rym: I did not run into anyone scary anyone douchey anyone jerky.

1581
01:29:39,231 --> 01:29:40,947
Rym: no one was like a fanboy wouldn't leave me alone.

1582
01:29:40,968 --> 01:29:48,070
Scott: and The scariest person that I saw who at packs that I can remember right Jackson?

1583
01:29:49,036 --> 01:29:55,406
Scott: No, no the in the Wolfman theater.

1584
01:29:56,274 --> 01:30:01,569
Scott: So they what some of the enforcers in there must have had Dolphies because there were Dolphies at the enforcer desk.

1585
01:30:01,790 --> 01:30:09,702
Scott: However, they don't know who they belong to but all of the enforcers in that room were totally chill and not scary Dolphie people even though there were Dolphies there.

1586
01:30:09,722 --> 01:30:18,170
Rym: so But it said it says some serious part of acts about Dolphies on a desk that even like Otakon anime.

1587
01:30:18,250 --> 01:30:20,698
Rym: But any anime can we go to I'll be.

1588
01:30:20,758 --> 01:30:36,305
Rym: basically when we're not doing panels have to largely hide not not necessarily from like listeners or fans or people but just we have to hide in general because Otherwise, we'll have like these mobs that won't go away and like I would know if I was out getting dinner at Otakon I would never tweet where I was.

1589
01:30:36,346 --> 01:30:38,818
Rym: good God I need time away at packs.

1590
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:40,686
Rym: I tweeted where I was all the time.

1591
01:30:40,967 --> 01:30:45,790
Rym: I'd like tweet like hey We're eating dinner here and like cool people would come and say hi Everyone was cool.

1592
01:30:45,912 --> 01:30:47,109
Rym: Everyone we played a game with was cool.

1593
01:30:47,573 --> 01:30:54,829
Rym: If you played a game with us just email me because one thing too I gave my business card out to a lot of people that I just like played one game with and hung out with.

1594
01:30:54,849 --> 01:31:00,690
Rym: I Would not give my phone number out and my direct email out that liberally at any other convention.

1595
01:31:01,032 --> 01:31:04,594
Scott: Yeah, the Noxonator showed up when you're eating dinner on Sunday.

1596
01:31:04,634 --> 01:31:09,532
Rym: yeah, because I tweeted out I was like hey anyone cool We talked to you saw our panels come say hi And he came.

1597
01:31:09,612 --> 01:31:13,571
Scott: so we were just sort of eating a dinner at the elephant and castle which is pretty good I think.

1598
01:31:14,033 --> 01:31:21,530
Scott: and then you know you know we're sort of going in not the most exciting dinner conversation But then this fan shows up, but it was totally awesome.

1599
01:31:21,631 --> 01:31:24,029
Scott: We got someone cool to talk to you for an hour about good stuff.

1600
01:31:24,371 --> 01:31:27,363
Rym: Yeah, we actually met a decent number of fans and people out there.

1601
01:31:27,603 --> 01:31:29,069
Rym: I can't give shout outs to all of you.

1602
01:31:29,491 --> 01:31:30,536
Scott: I don't even remember.

1603
01:31:30,576 --> 01:31:32,827
Scott: there are hundreds of people that were like oh, yeah, fuck.

1604
01:31:32,847 --> 01:31:36,127
Rym: Yeah, yep We spent a lot of our time hanging out with Rowan Jeremy.

1605
01:31:36,328 --> 01:31:36,530
Rym: yep.

1606
01:31:36,730 --> 01:31:47,699
Scott: So in the line for the end of packs right which we were very close to the front of that line we've played Zeus on the loose with Jeremy and Which is an okay little silly game.

1607
01:31:47,719 --> 01:31:49,770
Rym: You know one aside for the the lineup.

1608
01:31:49,850 --> 01:31:58,010
Rym: They got these people to do like line entertainment where you could text in and like vote for memes And like and then they'd show the meme and vote for stuff and play these games.

1609
01:31:58,090 --> 01:32:01,650
Rym: And they generally packs as always does a really good job of entertaining the line.

1610
01:32:01,932 --> 01:32:04,350
Scott: They know there's a line and no waiting in line sucks.

1611
01:32:04,410 --> 01:32:07,907
Scott: So they always just try different things to sort of entertain the people in line.

1612
01:32:07,987 --> 01:32:15,455
Rym: what amazes me Is that you know a long time ago our friends Yuko and Conrad and Ananth showed us power thirst Bear blast.

1613
01:32:15,515 --> 01:32:18,250
Scott: I don't even remember power thirst until you showed it to me the other day.

1614
01:32:18,431 --> 01:32:22,636
Rym: Oh, I remembered it because I always found it funny and every now And then it's relevant to things.

1615
01:32:23,218 --> 01:32:25,689
Rym: and just like I I don't know I found that mean really funny.

1616
01:32:25,709 --> 01:32:26,593
Rym: power There's run into.

1617
01:32:26,954 --> 01:32:29,043
Rym: so I showed it to Scott randomly for some reason.

1618
01:32:29,083 --> 01:32:33,054
Rym: then I showed it to like Emily randomly and then Not that long later.

1619
01:32:33,134 --> 01:32:35,260
Rym: It had this resurgence like at PAX.

1620
01:32:35,662 --> 01:32:38,028
Rym: It was voted up like twice, so they kept showing it.

1621
01:32:38,068 --> 01:32:49,579
Rym: I Don't know why like power thirst suddenly came to the front of the mean, but be mean pool Mm-hmm Alright, so then they had the beach balls.

1622
01:32:49,620 --> 01:32:53,289
Rym: people are on penises on him because the logo on the beach ball kind of looked like a penis.

1623
01:32:54,291 --> 01:32:55,014
Scott: He did kinda.

1624
01:32:55,657 --> 01:32:59,110
Scott: Oh, I forgot to talk about the swag bags and such right so and the wristbands and all that.

1625
01:32:59,211 --> 01:33:01,530
Scott: So like you get your badge in the mail, right?

1626
01:33:01,610 --> 01:33:04,424
Scott: So how do you get your swag bag or your wristband for the concert?

1627
01:33:04,464 --> 01:33:05,770
Scott: well in the line in the morning?

1628
01:33:05,890 --> 01:33:07,250
Scott: You just give them out like crazy.

1629
01:33:07,732 --> 01:33:14,898
Scott: the swag bag had like a freaking t-shirt in it and a video game in it Lord of the Rings online like it hold like The actual game was in there of course.

1630
01:33:14,958 --> 01:33:15,963
Scott: It's an online game right.

1631
01:33:15,983 --> 01:33:20,527
Scott: so they're making their money from the subscriptions And there was just all sorts of crazy shit in there.

1632
01:33:21,332 --> 01:33:24,343
Scott: I managed to pick one up on Saturday cuz I didn't pick one up on Friday.

1633
01:33:24,363 --> 01:33:26,350
Scott: I got my concert wristband also.

1634
01:33:27,234 --> 01:33:27,477
Scott: You know.

1635
01:33:27,518 --> 01:33:28,228
Scott: that's how that goes.

1636
01:33:29,671 --> 01:33:35,534
Scott: So yeah the end of packs the omega-thon final Dun-dun-dun.

1637
01:33:35,554 --> 01:33:39,790
Rym: the only bad thing I have to say about packs is every year the omega-thon final starts crazy late.

1638
01:33:40,052 --> 01:33:41,058
Scott: Yeah, they're really good reason.

1639
01:33:41,119 --> 01:33:42,850
Scott: They got to work on making it start on time.

1640
01:33:42,870 --> 01:33:44,676
Rym: No here's my idea on how to resolve it.

1641
01:33:45,037 --> 01:33:52,582
Rym: assume it's going to start late and schedule the start time an hour before it's actually going to start and But in front of the curtain.

1642
01:33:52,663 --> 01:33:56,649
Rym: here's what I will do What I would do if I can get all the stars in line.

1643
01:33:57,172 --> 01:34:00,050
Rym: Obviously, I'm not speaking on behalf of packs or super art fight.

1644
01:34:00,592 --> 01:34:06,110
Rym: But what if super art fight just ran in front of the curtains while like in the room before they did the omega-thon finale?

1645
01:34:06,232 --> 01:34:07,309
Scott: I also have another idea.

1646
01:34:08,271 --> 01:34:08,793
Scott: You should.

1647
01:34:09,054 --> 01:34:14,492
Scott: they should have both the the semi-final and the final rounds of the omega-thon Concurrently.

1648
01:34:14,994 --> 01:34:23,042
Scott: you know the four then the two then the one all at once instead of having the two rounds be separate Concurrently wouldn't work when I at the same time.

1649
01:34:23,082 --> 01:34:24,430
Rym: How do you know who won the first round?

1650
01:34:25,192 --> 01:34:26,838
Scott: I mean at the same time slot.

1651
01:34:26,978 --> 01:34:30,029
Scott: Yes, they would right so they would do the both rounds together.

1652
01:34:30,069 --> 01:34:36,175
Scott: that way It would sort of build you have the added excitement of the tournament effect because a lot of people don't go to every round of The omega-thon you know.

1653
01:34:36,637 --> 01:34:38,867
Scott: so put both both the final rounds together.

1654
01:34:39,308 --> 01:34:40,494
Scott: that way It's like whoo.

1655
01:34:40,614 --> 01:34:44,030
Scott: you know it's a bigger thing rather than just okay play game good go home.

1656
01:34:44,471 --> 01:34:47,060
Scott: You know which is sort of what it is regardless.

1657
01:34:47,080 --> 01:34:54,524
Scott: the reveal of what the final game is is always epic and I Could have guessed it had I thought about it more, but I didn't.

1658
01:34:54,644 --> 01:34:55,910
Scott: I'm not gonna say I did when I didn't.

1659
01:34:56,810 --> 01:34:59,469
Scott: The final game was epic as always.

1660
01:35:00,450 --> 01:35:01,794
Scott: Fucking skee-ball.

1661
01:35:01,975 --> 01:35:04,804
Rym: ah that I got to say one thing excellent excellent choice.

1662
01:35:05,185 --> 01:35:07,655
Rym: everybody up there sucked at skee-ball That's true.

1663
01:35:07,836 --> 01:35:08,700
Rym: I could have eaten all of them.

1664
01:35:08,821 --> 01:35:12,858
Scott: That's right of course Gabe all it beats I go at skee-ball as always man.

1665
01:35:12,919 --> 01:35:15,910
Rym: You know Jerry talks a big talk, but he's not good at video.

1666
01:35:16,171 --> 01:35:19,968
Rym: Dude you look like a little like he had all this majesty and stage presence.

1667
01:35:19,988 --> 01:35:20,530
Rym: like he's big.

1668
01:35:20,570 --> 01:35:25,161
Rym: He's larger than life when he's on stage As soon as he went to throw that first skee-ball.

1669
01:35:25,181 --> 01:35:27,755
Rym: It's like he shrunk into a little old lady Yeah, and he's like.

1670
01:35:27,915 --> 01:35:29,241
Scott: he's like he's trying to like everyone.

1671
01:35:29,302 --> 01:35:29,704
Scott: come on.

1672
01:35:29,724 --> 01:35:31,050
Scott: Let's get loud, and then he sucked.

1673
01:35:31,212 --> 01:35:33,133
Scott: He's like everyone quiet quiet You know.

1674
01:35:33,153 --> 01:35:37,529
Scott: he's like you couldn't make up his mind, and he I don't think he tried very hard either man thing is they?

1675
01:35:38,210 --> 01:35:39,274
Rym: Look at the first round.

1676
01:35:39,334 --> 01:35:45,806
Rym: told all where you know the one guy gets a score and the second guy realizes that all he has To do is get all 20s to beat that score, so he just got all 20s.

1677
01:35:46,470 --> 01:35:48,017
Rym: Yeah, played super conservatively.

1678
01:35:48,197 --> 01:35:48,619
Scott: no one what.

1679
01:35:48,679 --> 01:35:49,603
Scott: no one got a hundred.

1680
01:35:49,724 --> 01:35:51,110
Scott: I think there was like one or two fifties.

1681
01:35:51,191 --> 01:35:51,783
Scott: That was about it.

1682
01:35:52,211 --> 01:35:54,750
Scott: You know it's very bad skee-ball playing by everybody.

1683
01:35:54,991 --> 01:36:01,470
Scott: But you know it was kind of interesting because it was the runner-up from last year against someone else the someone-else ones.

1684
01:36:01,550 --> 01:36:04,420
Scott: The guy's been the omega-thon runner-up twice in a row.

1685
01:36:04,460 --> 01:36:06,668
Rym: he's going to be an omega not next year.

1686
01:36:06,688 --> 01:36:12,113
Scott: third Dude if this guy if he I think he might have a secret strategy of Like.

1687
01:36:12,213 --> 01:36:16,150
Scott: he has skills, and he's gonna be the runner-up in the omega-thon forever plus.

1688
01:36:16,250 --> 01:36:17,981
Scott: I would not want to play that dude in video games.

1689
01:36:18,001 --> 01:36:26,715
Scott: He's probably incredibly badass Like omega-thon semi you know non-winner like runner-up twice in a row or three times in a row I didn't even know anymore.

1690
01:36:26,735 --> 01:36:28,806
Scott: That's a dangerous gamer right there.

1691
01:36:28,846 --> 01:36:29,490
Scott: watch the fuck out.

1692
01:36:30,771 --> 01:36:34,970
Rym: But overall like other than the line for the end packs was just like perfect and awesome.

1693
01:36:35,432 --> 01:36:37,118
Rym: Everything about it was great everyone.

1694
01:36:37,138 --> 01:36:37,801
Rym: We met was cool.

1696
01:36:42,702 --> 01:36:44,309
Rym: don't don't feel like we're just gonna ignore you.

1697
01:36:44,570 --> 01:36:46,196
Rym: Yeah, I gave you that business card for a reason.

1698
01:36:46,558 --> 01:36:49,830
Scott: so anything that I can remember about the packs that we did not mention

1699
01:36:49,930 --> 01:36:54,011
Rym: I'm sure there's a ton of stuff left to talk about in like a brief follow-up on Thursday There'll

1700
01:36:54,031 --> 01:37:01,143
Scott: be many details of reviewing individual games and talking with specific Interviews with people and all that sort of stuff in the future.

1701
01:37:01,163 --> 01:37:02,950
Scott: this episode has gone on long enough.

1702
01:37:03,452 --> 01:37:06,267
Scott: I gotta upload and yep, I hope the Chinese restaurants still open.

1703
01:37:06,387 --> 01:37:07,698
Rym: one last thing I will point out.

1704
01:37:07,778 --> 01:37:08,324
Rym: there was a con.

1705
01:37:08,344 --> 01:37:12,323
Rym: there was a Pax Flu a con SARS as happens at cons like it was the.

1706
01:37:12,424 --> 01:37:13,488
Scott: it was the swine flu.

1707
01:37:13,508 --> 01:37:13,910
Scott: apparently

1708
01:37:13,930 --> 01:37:33,470
Rym: yes So far Robert Koo is tweeting out and pointing out that there has been at least one straight-up confirmed case of h1n1 You know flu at packs And they're asking anyone who tests positive After they get home to email him with your flight numbers and all this information so they can track what's going on and probably work with the CDC, but Emily and Alex both have it.

1709
01:37:33,490 --> 01:37:36,464
Rym: They're probably gonna get tested tomorrow to find out if they had the h1n1.

1710
01:37:36,846 --> 01:37:48,161
Scott: somehow Scott And I came out unscathed, but well I was really dry and scratchy in the throat area and I thought that was just the usual really you know Dehumidifying air conditioning of staying at a convention center all day.

1711
01:37:48,222 --> 01:37:50,330
Rym: I think we've got silly was and fought it off.

1712
01:37:50,451 --> 01:37:52,100
Rym: I really think I got it and fought it off.

1713
01:37:52,482 --> 01:37:53,729
Scott: I might have it's tough call.

1714
01:37:53,869 --> 01:37:58,466
Rym: well I was exposed to it up like several months ago, and I got sick, but I didn't get sick.

1715
01:37:58,506 --> 01:38:06,790
Rym: water is poison survived it Yeah, so so as our friend Lisa who is an expert in these sort of things points out Yeah, she's going for a doctorate and everything.

1716
01:38:06,851 --> 01:38:07,577
Rym: She's super smart.

1717
01:38:08,263 --> 01:38:12,621
Rym: if you get it now And it doesn't kill you You're probably in a great position because this might.

1718
01:38:12,661 --> 01:38:19,090
Rym: this is the beginning of probably the second wave of it And if you know it probably won't turn into a deadly like crazy deadly thing.

1719
01:38:19,130 --> 01:38:25,030
Rym: But if it does and you get it now you have a good chance of being pretty okay when it comes through in force.

1720
01:38:25,492 --> 01:38:27,723
Rym: Yep, so don't feel too bad as like.

1721
01:38:27,743 --> 01:38:35,567
Rym: just make sure you you know Get treated, but seriously if you're sick And you went to PAX and you're listening to this and you didn't go to a doctor go to a doctor.

1722
01:38:35,748 --> 01:38:36,270
Rym: go to a doctor.

1723
01:38:36,350 --> 01:38:43,929
Rym: You might have the swine flu, and if you do have the swine flu email Robert Koo and tell him yes And tell him your flight number.

1724
01:38:45,211 --> 01:38:49,105

01:38:53,580 --> 01:38:56,530
Scott: I can't remember a single non awesome part of PAX.

1729
01:38:56,751 --> 01:39:08,070
Rym: I cannot think of any not having breakfast and the NS guys not being there with the possible exception of the party that I ran At a send 2002 a long time ago, and even then that is that is rose-colored glasses.

1730
01:39:08,814 --> 01:39:14,682
Rym: No convention has ever been better than PAX 2009. for me No convention other than that has ever been better than PAX 2008 for me.

Rym: Yeah, and PAX East is coming.

Scott: It was not an illusion.

1733
01:39:20,311 --> 01:39:23,603
Scott: PAX we remembered it being awesome much like Evangelion.

1734
01:39:23,624 --> 01:39:31,170
Scott: It was awesomer than we remembered Either because it was awesomer this year than last year, or it's just you know that much more awesome.

1735
01:39:31,712 --> 01:39:32,515
Scott: PAX is the win.
