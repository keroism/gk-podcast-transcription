1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,709
Rym: Hey, it's Tuesday, September 22nd, I'm Rym.

2
00:00:12,749 --> 00:00:13,230
Rym: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:13,351 --> 00:00:17,180
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight, the new hotness from PAX, Dominion.

4
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:26,928
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:31,529
Rym: Yeah!

6
00:00:31,975 --> 00:00:32,259
Rym: Yeah!

7
00:00:33,641 --> 00:00:35,027
Rym: I've been playing a lot of NS.

8
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:35,630
Scott: Really?

9
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,020
Scott: I played some NS, but then I stopped a little bit.

10
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,508
Rym: Like I suddenly, I was sitting at home, you know, because I was working the night shift for like that whole week, and I was working from home.

11
00:00:44,993 --> 00:00:49,040
Rym: So over lunch, I couldn't sleep because I was all wired up on caffeine to stay awake over the night.

12
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,600
Rym: So I'd play like an hour of NS with all the like European people who were playing.

13
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,120
Scott: Ah, Europeans, much better NS than Americans.

14
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,527
Rym: Oh my god, they're so much better.

15
00:00:56,547 --> 00:00:58,235
Rym: They're so polite and organized.

16
00:00:58,496 --> 00:00:59,240
Rym: And you think I'm joking.

17
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,284
Rym: No, I'm dead serious.

18
00:01:00,324 --> 00:01:08,500
Rym: Like the Marines, like everyone listened to what the commander had to say, though we had this epic moment where we're supposed to go to waste, you know, the waste hive.

19
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,280
Scott: Waste handling.

20
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:14,520
Rym: We're basically, we're losing the game, but we can take the waste hive and then we got a good shot.

21
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,940
Rym: We got a lot of rez, like more rez than we should have.

22
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,966
Rym: So he spends all the last rez.

23
00:01:18,986 --> 00:01:23,682
Rym: we've got on all these shotguns and jetpacks and everything, and he's like go to waste, go to waste, go to waste.

24
00:01:24,304 --> 00:01:32,940
Rym: And like two guys go to waste, and one jackass starts walking toward cargo, and everyone starts following him, just not paying attention, and the team splits up and everybody dies.

25
00:01:34,243 --> 00:01:34,303
Rym: Yep.

26
00:01:34,584 --> 00:01:38,660
Rym: And basically 10 seconds after this happens, the commander's like, why didn't you go to waste?

27
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,271
Rym: No, he's like, what the fuck you guys doing?

28
00:01:41,934 --> 00:01:42,857
Rym: You've ruined everything.

29
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:43,500
Rym: Never mind.

30
00:01:43,581 --> 00:01:44,509
Rym: He just like leaves the command chair.

31
00:01:44,529 --> 00:01:45,054
Rym: He's like, fuck it.

32
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:56,709
Rym: But I got to say, yeah, that guy, that guy formed, the man formerly known as alien commander, brain dude, in every single game I played like for the last week.

33
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:58,299
Rym: Yeah, and it's not just him.

34
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,960
Rym: Everyone is emulating him now.

35
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:07,220
Rym: I don't know if suddenly like he's taken off in our culture, but I was playing and some other guy's like, yeah, got him.

36
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,479
Rym: Yeah, and then that guy's like, yeah, yeah.

37
00:02:11,704 --> 00:02:14,040
Rym: And the whole Marine team is, yeah, because we rush the hive.

38
00:02:15,485 --> 00:02:16,478
Rym: I love NS so much.

39
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:21,420
Scott: You know what, we're going to mod NS2, me and water is poison, we decided.

40
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,280
Scott: We're going to yaw mod.

41
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,580
Scott: I'm making, because you know, there's the chuckle, right?

42
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:25,982
Rym: Yeah.

43
00:02:26,002 --> 00:02:29,035
Scott: And there's the, you know, don't see that every day.

44
00:02:29,055 --> 00:02:30,180
Rym: Thank God.

45
00:02:30,606 --> 00:02:31,379
Scott: And what's the other one?

46
00:02:31,865 --> 00:02:32,378
Rym: There's a few.

47
00:02:33,182 --> 00:02:34,030
Scott: Yeah.

48
00:02:34,292 --> 00:02:35,100
Scott: But anyway, I'm going to add one.

49
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,330
Scott: It's just like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

50
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,559
Rym: See, you got to actually record that guy.

51
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,720
Scott: Of course, I'm going to call him up, man.

52
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,080
Rym: I didn't even I didn't talk to him because I was playing the game.

53
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,580
Rym: But every time after I play, I'm like, man, I should talk to that guy.

54
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,860
Rym: I want to interview him on the show to be like, what's your deal, dude?

55
00:02:50,301 --> 00:02:51,579
Scott: Yeah, he's just a cool dude.

56
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:52,590
Rym: I believe you mean.

57
00:02:52,712 --> 00:02:53,199
Rym: Yeah.

58
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:58,220
Scott: One one time I was playing and he was talking about how you have to do LSD once in your life.

59
00:02:58,622 --> 00:02:59,599
Scott: That's what he's talking about.

60
00:03:01,843 --> 00:03:05,200
Rym: Anyway, you know, I kind of agree, having read most of Steppenwolf.

61
00:03:05,641 --> 00:03:07,440
Scott: Yeah, I think I'll wait till I'm an old man, though.

62
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:11,180
Scott: I don't want to take any chance of ruining the young years.

63
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:11,684
Rym: It depends.

64
00:03:11,704 --> 00:03:12,940
Rym: Did you finish Steppenwolf yet?

65
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,840
Rym: No, you might want to take the LSD soon.

66
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,784
Scott: I'm about halfway through.

67
00:03:16,045 --> 00:03:19,200
Scott: Yeah, I won't be able to finish the book.

68
00:03:22,065 --> 00:03:24,480
Scott: If you take the LSD and then read the book, the whole thing changes.

69
00:03:26,281 --> 00:03:26,884
Rym: It's like the bonus.

70
00:03:26,944 --> 00:03:30,720
Scott: Actually, there's another book that would be a hilarious thing to put in this conversation.

71
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,909
Scott: Did you read about that?

72
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,079
Scott: The red book in The New York Times?

73
00:03:33,703 --> 00:03:35,200
Rym: I have no idea what you're talking about.

74
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,220
Scott: OK, then I won't talk about it any further in this show.

75
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:37,905
Rym: The red book.

76
00:03:37,925 --> 00:03:39,639
Scott: Yeah, we'll talk about after the show.

77
00:03:40,021 --> 00:03:40,262
Rym: All right.

78
00:03:40,745 --> 00:03:43,099
Rym: But so, yeah, I've pretty much just been playing NS.

79
00:03:43,921 --> 00:03:44,302
Scott: All right.

80
00:03:45,346 --> 00:03:49,480
Scott: So, yeah, I have been playing and this transfers into the news.

81
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,057
Rym: Oh, well, well, well, well, well, well.

82
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:58,320
Rym: We've been playing other games, but we're saving that for a show that we've been actually been playing a shit ton of games.

83
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,980
Scott: There is no doubt it is fucking game season.

84
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:01,723
Rym: You put it this way.

85
00:04:01,804 --> 00:04:04,720
Scott: Anime season was like, you know, back a few weeks ago.

86
00:04:04,882 --> 00:04:06,220
Scott: It is now game season.

87
00:04:07,401 --> 00:04:12,138
Rym: I'm only playing right now two good games, but I'm playing like 11 games.

88
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,599
Scott: I've been playing tons of games.

89
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,911
Scott: It is game season 100 percent.

90
00:04:17,101 --> 00:04:18,180
Scott: Sorry, other seasons.

91
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,860
Scott: You'll come again in a month or two, but it is game season right now.

92
00:04:22,022 --> 00:04:22,999
Scott: I can't repeat that enough.

93
00:04:23,201 --> 00:04:25,100
Rym: I keep getting that quote from so far in my head.

94
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,580
Rym: There's a time for every season.

95
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,166
Scott: So the thing is, there is.

96
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:31,180
Scott: I didn't find any gaming news as I wanted to talk about.

97
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:40,080
Scott: So but one game I have been playing is the Scribblenauts, which I got yesterday in the mail, and I played it last night and this morning and this afternoon.

98
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:45,200
Scott: And, you know, there's not really enough in that game to do a whole show about.

99
00:04:46,081 --> 00:04:50,279
Scott: So I'll do a geek bite on Scribblenauts instead of the news, and then we won't need to talk about it ever again.

100
00:04:51,301 --> 00:04:57,640
Scott: So the Scribblenauts is very popular and very well known because they did very, very, very, very, very good marketing.

101
00:04:58,581 --> 00:05:06,640
Scott: They're like, hey, we have a DS game and it's a puzzle game and you write something in and then it appears whenever you write in and you can type in all sorts of crazy stuff.

102
00:05:07,021 --> 00:05:12,520
Scott: And they showed that you could bring like Cthulhu and all sorts of weird things and also all sorts of mundane things.

103
00:05:12,961 --> 00:05:18,760
Scott: And the idea of a game where you solve puzzles with anything you can think of, that's like totally awesome.

104
00:05:18,941 --> 00:05:19,203
Scott: Right.

105
00:05:19,304 --> 00:05:21,119
Scott: So everyone was like psyched up for this game.

106
00:05:21,681 --> 00:05:26,140
Scott: And my initial reaction before playing it was, yeah, you know what this game is going to be?

107
00:05:26,561 --> 00:05:30,920
Scott: It's going to be like really, really all about the novelty of making weird shit appear.

108
00:05:31,301 --> 00:05:38,440
Scott: And as soon as you've tried a whole bunch of different things that are all funky, you're going to be bored with this game and it's going to be a very, very low replay value.

109
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:45,700
Rym: Now, the thing is, I will just note ahead of time that it would have been possible for this to have been a much greater game, irrespective of all that.

110
00:05:47,001 --> 00:05:48,699
Rym: But it wasn't, they didn't do it.

111
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:52,700
Scott: Well, basically, that's what I expected, right, was this, you know, short term novelty.

112
00:05:53,601 --> 00:05:59,317
Scott: What I got right now that I've played it for over, you know, basically a day and change is.

113
00:05:59,337 --> 00:06:00,320
Rym: I was wrong.

114
00:06:00,762 --> 00:06:02,620
Scott: It's not a game where novelty runs out.

115
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:03,041
Scott: Right.

116
00:06:03,082 --> 00:06:08,200
Scott: There's actually just so many things you can type in that the novelty is is really does last a very long time.

117
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:13,560
Scott: The problem is, is that, A, the controls are really, really, really bad.

118
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,988
Rym: Wait, are they on the level of ass?

119
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,976
Scott: They're pretty ass like something like you'll have to like.

120
00:06:20,317 --> 00:06:20,720
Scott: I'll try.

121
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:21,142
Scott: Let's.

122
00:06:21,203 --> 00:06:22,056
Scott: here's an example.

123
00:06:22,117 --> 00:06:22,299
Scott: Right.

124
00:06:22,744 --> 00:06:23,877
Scott: So there'll be a block of ice.

125
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,360
Scott: So I make a flamethrower, the flamethrower.

126
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,080
Scott: I sort of have to get it with the stylus and it's sort of small.

127
00:06:29,161 --> 00:06:29,504
Scott: So I got to.

128
00:06:29,908 --> 00:06:31,200
Scott: So I give my guy the flamethrower.

129
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,419
Scott: But my guy is standing in front of another guy.

130
00:06:33,742 --> 00:06:36,559
Scott: So I accidentally gave the flamethrower to the guy I'm standing in front of.

131
00:06:36,801 --> 00:06:38,839
Scott: So I have to steal it from him and give it back to my guy.

132
00:06:39,281 --> 00:06:44,700
Scott: And then wherever you touch on the screen, your guy walks to where you touched, not in the direction of your touching.

133
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,261
Scott: Right.

134
00:06:45,683 --> 00:06:50,220
Scott: So it's basically you touch somewhere and then your guy walks all the way to the spot you touched, which is annoying.

135
00:06:50,641 --> 00:06:52,120
Scott: So let's say there's a block of ice.

136
00:06:52,281 --> 00:06:52,967
Scott: I want to melt it.

137
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:54,360
Scott: So I'm holding the flamethrower.

138
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,518
Scott: I tap the block of ice.

139
00:06:56,063 --> 00:06:57,460
Scott: The guy walks to the block of ice.

140
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:59,820
Scott: I'm like, no, I wanted you to shoot the flame at the block of ice.

141
00:07:00,241 --> 00:07:03,720
Scott: It's like the game doesn't know if you want to walk there, if you want to shoot the flamethrower there.

142
00:07:04,101 --> 00:07:07,700
Scott: Like I made an iceberg as a bridge once because it's really big iceberg.

143
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:14,100
Scott: And I touched it and my guy shot the iceberg instead of walking onto the iceberg because it's the same spot.

144
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:21,300
Scott: You know, and it's just that you can't get any precision movement and there'll be levels where you have a good solution and it's going to work.

145
00:07:21,661 --> 00:07:27,080
Scott: But you just touch the wrong thing or you can't possibly react quick enough, like there's a level where there's a dinosaur.

146
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:34,620
Scott: So my my strategy is go over to the dinosaur until he chases you, run away, then turn around and shoot him.

147
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:35,322
Scott: Right.

148
00:07:35,643 --> 00:07:40,580
Scott: The thing is, it's so fast and the controls are so unresponsive, I can't possibly execute that.

149
00:07:40,902 --> 00:07:42,999
Scott: So I need to do something else, which is very annoying.

150
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:58,720
Scott: Regardless of the bad controls, the real problem with the game, right, I could get past these bad controls because I did manage to control it well enough to get by just frustratingly, is that objects don't really work the way that they work.

151
00:07:59,182 --> 00:07:59,443
Scott: Right.

152
00:07:59,523 --> 00:08:02,498
Scott: Is that you can't solve problems with any cleverness.

153
00:08:03,141 --> 00:08:03,321
Scott: Right.

154
00:08:03,342 --> 00:08:07,540
Scott: That's what I really want from the game is to be able to solve the puzzles by being clever.

155
00:08:07,661 --> 00:08:11,100
Scott: But really, all the objects are basically all the same.

156
00:08:11,441 --> 00:08:11,661
Scott: Right.

157
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:18,300
Scott: An object either A moves you, B moves something else, C does damage to something.

158
00:08:18,882 --> 00:08:19,224
Scott: Right.

159
00:08:19,746 --> 00:08:23,280
Scott: It's like all the you know, all the objects do sort of the same thing.

160
00:08:23,381 --> 00:08:25,760
Scott: And it doesn't matter whether you choose like rope or chain.

161
00:08:26,143 --> 00:08:27,940
Scott: They look different, but they do the same thing.

162
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,634
Scott: Baseball, basketball, football, you can.

163
00:08:30,735 --> 00:08:31,680
Scott: they all do the same thing.

164
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,346
Scott: You can throw them.

165
00:08:32,527 --> 00:08:34,000
Scott: There's no difference whatsoever.

166
00:08:34,621 --> 00:08:38,535
Scott: And objects don't really have any sort of clever or unique properties.

167
00:08:38,557 --> 00:08:39,419
Scott: like there was a tornado.

168
00:08:39,982 --> 00:08:42,059
Scott: So I made the sun come out thinking I'll be clever.

169
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,837
Scott: The tornado will go away if the sun comes out.

170
00:08:44,181 --> 00:08:45,126
Scott: No, that didn't matter.

171
00:08:45,668 --> 00:08:47,920
Scott: Well, maybe a gust of wind will cancel the tornado.

172
00:08:48,244 --> 00:08:49,380
Scott: No, I know.

173
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,140
Scott: I'll drive a tank through the tornado.

174
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,139
Scott: A tank is so heavy, a tornado couldn't possibly pick it up.

175
00:08:54,682 --> 00:08:56,420
Scott: The tank was bigger than the tornado.

176
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,660
Scott: The tornado just blew the tank away.

177
00:08:59,361 --> 00:08:59,663
Scott: All right.

178
00:08:59,964 --> 00:09:03,260
Scott: The way I eventually solved it was I went on the Internet and I looked at what people suggested.

179
00:09:04,521 --> 00:09:06,719
Scott: And one guy suggested riding a cow.

180
00:09:07,222 --> 00:09:08,007
Scott: So I rode a cow.

181
00:09:08,067 --> 00:09:10,200
Scott: I got on the cow and I tried to ride it through the tornado.

182
00:09:10,961 --> 00:09:12,240
Scott: The cow got bounced around.

183
00:09:12,401 --> 00:09:21,199
Scott: But it just so happened that the weight of the cow was such and the size of the cow were such that if you just kept going, you would eventually get over the tornado if you're riding a cow.

184
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,100
Rym: Now, that could at least make sense.

185
00:09:23,702 --> 00:09:26,860
Rym: I mean, if there are like four other solutions that are more intuitive.

186
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:36,499
Scott: I think the correct solution actually was to tie a rope to the object on the other side of the tornado, then have the rope get caught in the tornado and then the object would get flung over to you.

187
00:09:37,082 --> 00:09:39,160
Scott: That was the solution I saw elsewhere on the Internet.

188
00:09:39,521 --> 00:09:42,760
Rym: Or you just make like a shelter or something and then let the tornado go over you.

189
00:09:42,941 --> 00:09:44,099
Scott: It doesn't work like that.

190
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,700
Rym: Someone said that works just fine.

191
00:09:45,861 --> 00:09:46,185
Rym: Really?

192
00:09:46,649 --> 00:09:47,700
Scott: I tried to do something like that.

193
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,431
Scott: It didn't really work.

194
00:09:48,533 --> 00:09:48,878
Rym: I don't know.

195
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:51,300
Scott: Yeah, but basically that's just one example.

196
00:09:51,441 --> 00:09:51,581
Scott: Right.

197
00:09:51,601 --> 00:09:54,674
Scott: There are many, many other examples I can give like the.

198
00:09:54,875 --> 00:10:01,220
Scott: there's one annoying level where basically there's a button and there's the object you're trying to get and there's a spike.

199
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,260
Scott: So as soon as you hit the button, the object falls on the spike and disappears.

200
00:10:04,822 --> 00:10:08,080
Scott: You have to get up there to get the object when the buttons hit.

201
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:14,321
Scott: So basically the only solution is was like I made like a ramp or a slide to get the object to land on that.

202
00:10:14,341 --> 00:10:21,739
Scott: And it's like I had to position it real careful, like so the object would fall the right way and then it falls down in the water where there's a shark.

203
00:10:22,441 --> 00:10:23,265
Scott: And so you got to kill this.

204
00:10:23,325 --> 00:10:25,453
Scott: You know, it's you can't like.

205
00:10:25,493 --> 00:10:32,760
Scott: I wanted to solve the puzzles and like, you know, I always tried like clever things that sort of make sense and they never work.

206
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,580
Scott: The only things that ever work are like use a jet pack, use a rope, use a net, use a gun.

207
00:10:38,044 --> 00:10:38,998
Scott: Those are the things that work.

208
00:10:39,481 --> 00:10:42,139
Scott: You know, things that are clever don't work.

209
00:10:42,521 --> 00:10:44,168
Scott: You know, nothing that makes sense works.

210
00:10:44,188 --> 00:10:48,105
Scott: like I like there was a sheep, so I got an air horn and I blew the air horn.

211
00:10:48,266 --> 00:10:50,480
Scott: The sheep didn't like start running like I wanted it to.

212
00:10:51,101 --> 00:10:55,279
Scott: I think that's another problem is the game doesn't let you push or pull things with your character's hands.

213
00:10:55,741 --> 00:10:58,660
Scott: If I could do that, a lot of the game would make a lot more sense.

214
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:09,165
Rym: Well, I think part of it is that what they were going for is they had the right idea in one regard that the game would have been completely useless if they didn't have like a surprising number of things like.

215
00:11:09,727 --> 00:11:12,360
Rym: the fact that the list is so exhaustive is the selling point.

216
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,772
Rym: But clearly all they did was put all their time into.

217
00:11:15,812 --> 00:11:23,400
Rym: they made like a list of parameters and then they just spent all their time making as many different novel objects as possible fit into those parameters.

218
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,537
Rym: But the parameters are simple enough to where the majority of objects all functioned in the same way.

219
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,965
Scott: Yeah.

220
00:11:28,985 --> 00:11:32,141
Rym: And as a result, they didn't spend much time on the puzzles or really any other part of the game.

221
00:11:32,543 --> 00:11:42,480
Rym: What bothers me more, this really harkens back to that panel that Alex went to at where they talked about how pretty much games that have demos don't sell as well.

222
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,840
Scott: That wasn't what the panel was about.

223
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,824
Scott: It was just one point of.

224
00:11:44,985 --> 00:11:50,480
Rym: that was the most disturbing point that they had all this data about what makes games really sell and all that.

225
00:11:50,941 --> 00:11:55,664
Rym: And the data shows that if you have a demo, your game will sell far less than if you don't have a demo.

226
00:11:56,106 --> 00:11:58,560
Rym: And if you have a good trailer, your game will sell like crazy.

227
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:02,139
Rym: The best way to sell a game is to have a great concept and no demo at all.

228
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:02,681
Rym: Yep.

229
00:12:03,326 --> 00:12:05,240
Rym: And I think Scribblenauts is the best example of that.

230
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,019
Rym: They marketed it up.

231
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,740
Rym: This game is going to make crazy money, but it's kind of a shit game.

232
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:09,400
Scott: Yeah.

233
00:12:09,601 --> 00:12:11,670
Scott: I mean, I would not lend it to you.

234
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,181
Scott: now that I'm you know, I really I don't feel like playing.

235
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:20,720
Rym: I mean, I guess it's partly that they literally just put as many objects in as possible, but didn't make the objects distinct enough to where the game was interesting.

236
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:21,803
Scott: Well, think about it.

237
00:12:21,823 --> 00:12:22,486
Scott: You know, it's not.

238
00:12:22,647 --> 00:12:26,422
Scott: it wasn't really a monument of programming task, right.

239
00:12:26,502 --> 00:12:36,480
Scott: To, you know, just create basically for each object, you need like a sprite and you've already sort of programmed like, you know, all they did, they sort of have categories of objects, like all the foods work the same way.

240
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,363
Scott: Like if you there's an animal that's hungry, any food you come up with will work because they're all foods.

241
00:12:41,664 --> 00:12:41,905
Scott: Right.

242
00:12:41,986 --> 00:12:45,584
Scott: It's not like a cake will make it sick and a steak will make it happy.

243
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:47,180
Scott: You know, it's just any food is good.

244
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:53,040
Rym: This is again, though, a situation remember in the with that panel we did losing should be fun, where I talked a lot about procedural content generation.

245
00:12:53,321 --> 00:12:53,542
Rym: Yeah.

246
00:12:53,683 --> 00:12:56,920
Rym: And now in the end, that will facilitate like this whole new era of gaming.

247
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:03,680
Rym: Imagine a Scribblenauts where the objects were very, very precisely defined with parameters that wouldn't necessarily matter.

248
00:13:04,321 --> 00:13:08,520
Rym: But the game kind of procedurally with a physics engine or something did everything.

249
00:13:09,201 --> 00:13:09,482
Scott: Yeah.

250
00:13:09,542 --> 00:13:13,720
Scott: The thing is, it says to really make the game be what I would like it to be.

251
00:13:14,441 --> 00:13:20,644
Scott: You'd really have to have someone actually program really specific and unique things for each object.

252
00:13:20,705 --> 00:13:26,260
Scott: You know, like you would have to like the objects would have to have a lot more complex behaviors specific to themselves.

253
00:13:26,702 --> 00:13:27,613
Scott: You know, like the sun.

254
00:13:27,633 --> 00:13:27,734
Scott: Right.

255
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:32,560
Scott: All the sun was programmed to do is show up in the background and make the sky bright.

256
00:13:32,661 --> 00:13:33,244
Scott: That's all it did.

257
00:13:33,586 --> 00:13:35,698
Scott: It didn't remove it didn't change any weathers.

258
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:36,261
Scott: It did.

259
00:13:36,301 --> 00:13:41,800
Scott: You know, you had you'd have to program manually all these complex interactions between specific objects.

260
00:13:42,702 --> 00:13:54,479
Scott: And because the game doesn't have that, the game feels really unrewarding because I'm trying all these really clever things and none of them work, the only the brain dead things or completely nonsensical things work.

261
00:13:54,901 --> 00:14:04,686
Scott: So I feel like, you know, I'm trying to be smart and the game is just rewarding me for it at all from a lot of people is that you can you said this to you basically just jetpack through most of the game.

262
00:14:04,746 --> 00:14:04,968
Scott: Oh, yeah.

263
00:14:04,988 --> 00:14:06,660
Scott: And that's the other thing is I want to try.

264
00:14:06,881 --> 00:14:07,042
Scott: Right.

265
00:14:07,082 --> 00:14:08,980
Scott: I want to use all sorts of different objects.

266
00:14:09,121 --> 00:14:09,383
Scott: Right.

267
00:14:09,908 --> 00:14:11,140
Scott: And it's like I just can't.

268
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,560
Scott: Anything I come up with either just is useless.

269
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:15,501
Scott: Right.

270
00:14:15,843 --> 00:14:18,480
Scott: And the few things that I've already come up with are useful.

271
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,160
Scott: It's like what's really useful.

272
00:14:20,441 --> 00:14:27,599
Scott: The rope, the grappling hook, the fishing rod, the jet pack, you know, a trampoline, the ladder, the crate.

273
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,440
Scott: You know, there's just a few things.

274
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,140
Scott: The iceberg is pretty useful that are really useful chains.

275
00:14:34,682 --> 00:14:37,359
Scott: And they're so I can solve almost any problem with just those.

276
00:14:38,182 --> 00:14:40,279
Scott: And when I try to come up with other things, they never work.

277
00:14:40,561 --> 00:14:43,240
Scott: So I feel I don't even bother trying to come up with other things anymore.

278
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,660
Scott: I just use the same things over and over if they made the game.

279
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:51,259
Rym: Imagine if they made the game where instead of, you know, what you're doing now, you had to solve the same puzzle like eight times.

280
00:14:51,721 --> 00:14:56,204
Rym: And the way it worked was every time you used an object to solve it, you couldn't use that again.

281
00:14:56,264 --> 00:14:57,672
Rym: And you had to keep solving.

282
00:14:57,712 --> 00:14:59,040
Rym: a thing is that would be good.

283
00:14:59,381 --> 00:15:05,022
Scott: But the puzzles are are basically so like if you look online at some of the strategy guides.

284
00:15:05,244 --> 00:15:05,465
Scott: Right.

285
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:07,878
Scott: Which you assume that like, you know, this is actually a site.

286
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,879
Scott: It's like Scribblenauts guide, I think.

287
00:15:10,481 --> 00:15:14,725
Scott: And it's sort of a wiki site where people are like, you know, typing in all the information.

288
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:16,320
Scott: And it's like collaborative.

289
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:24,160
Scott: And you look at some of the puzzles and some of the puzzles, there's like maybe four solutions that people have posted and they're all very, very similar.

290
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,362
Scott: There aren't.

291
00:15:25,483 --> 00:15:29,201
Scott: the puzzles are not such that there are so many different ways to solve them.

292
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:32,964
Scott: It's like, yeah, you could solve it with a rope or you could solve it with a chain.

293
00:15:33,146 --> 00:15:34,539
Scott: You could solve it with the fishing rod.

294
00:15:35,002 --> 00:15:37,839
Scott: You know, it's like there aren't a lot of different things you can do.

295
00:15:38,984 --> 00:15:40,320
Scott: It's pretty much only one way.

296
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:45,000
Rym: The important question is, though, before I spoil the game and just read game facts, can you type Rick Astley?

297
00:15:45,443 --> 00:15:46,107
Scott: I haven't tried it.

298
00:15:46,228 --> 00:15:48,040
Rym: That would have made the game says like no cop.

299
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,527
Scott: It says at the beginning of the game, like, you know, no copyrighted things, et cetera, et cetera.

300
00:15:52,587 --> 00:15:54,200
Scott: So, you know, it's no vulgarity.

301
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,720
Rym: If I were them, I would have made a deal with Rick Astley.

302
00:15:58,523 --> 00:16:00,279
Scott: I haven't tried Rick Astley, so I don't know.

303
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,040
Rym: But I know they didn't.

304
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,436
Rym: They should have, but I know they didn't.

305
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,001
Scott: Yeah.

306
00:16:04,504 --> 00:16:14,840
Rym: So back in actual gaming news, I just want to point out, you know, everyone was super pissed off when they announced Left 4 Dead 2 so soon after Left 4 Dead when they really should have just made it as a sequel.

307
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,980
Rym: But, you know, as well, not really a sequel, but as like continuing content.

308
00:16:18,641 --> 00:16:23,501
Rym: But they swore that Left 4 Dead would have continued to be continually supported for a while.

309
00:16:24,445 --> 00:16:30,219
Rym: And they've kind of proven that there's another like course, like another way of playing called Crash Course supposedly coming out.

310
00:16:30,401 --> 00:16:30,785
Rym: Oh, really?

311
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,300
Rym: Actually, it's supposedly coming out tomorrow.

312
00:16:32,581 --> 00:16:33,067
Rym: Oh, shit.

313
00:16:33,087 --> 00:16:34,140
Scott: I guess know what I'm doing tomorrow.

314
00:16:34,683 --> 00:16:36,020
Rym: And they've made a bunch of updates.

315
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,540
Rym: So they added a bunch of achievements, whatever.

316
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:38,242
Rym: But whatever.

317
00:16:38,463 --> 00:16:44,720
Rym: They made an obvious improvement that is so obvious and yet is going to make the game so much more fun for the infected.

318
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:45,262
Scott: What is it?

319
00:16:45,342 --> 00:16:47,959
Rym: And so much less fun for the non-infected in multiplayer.

320
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:48,761
Scott: What is it?

321
00:16:49,284 --> 00:16:56,900
Rym: So if you're infected, your HUD will not only show the recharge of your special attack, but the recharge of all of the other infected special attacks.

322
00:16:57,404 --> 00:16:58,440
Scott: So obvious.

323
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,507
Rym: Yeah, duh.

324
00:16:59,568 --> 00:17:00,539
Rym: But I didn't think of that.

325
00:17:00,941 --> 00:17:02,360
Scott: No, I didn't think of that either.

326
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:16,771
Scott: That's, you know, that reminds me, I was reading an article on Kotaku, I just say this real quick, where they're interviewing the Metroid Prime developers and they had really, really fascinating stuff with talking about how they got Metroid jumping in Metroid Prime to not suck.

327
00:17:16,893 --> 00:17:17,560
Rym: I was reading that.

328
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,726
Scott: That was really fascinating.

329
00:17:18,807 --> 00:17:22,003
Rym: Yeah, because I got to say jumping in 3D games like that sucks ass.

330
00:17:22,023 --> 00:17:26,067
Scott: They're basically like, hey, you made this first person shooter where jumping actually works.

331
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:27,700
Scott: You know, no one else had done that before.

332
00:17:28,141 --> 00:17:28,845
Scott: How did you do it?

333
00:17:28,865 --> 00:17:32,707
Scott: And they were like, well, we experimented with all these things and yada, yada, yada.

334
00:17:32,727 --> 00:17:33,796
Scott: And it was like, oh, wow, they're wow.

335
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:34,846
Scott: They're good.

336
00:17:35,313 --> 00:17:35,638
Scott: Real good.

337
00:17:36,162 --> 00:17:36,303
Rym: Yeah.

338
00:17:36,323 --> 00:17:41,938
Rym: You know, for all the shitty games we play, it's always refreshing to see a game that does something well and then listen to the smart people say why it did so.

339
00:17:41,998 --> 00:17:42,160
Rym: well.

340
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:42,701
Scott: Yeah.

341
00:17:42,802 --> 00:17:44,679
Scott: Other people who make games take heed.

342
00:17:45,462 --> 00:17:45,623
Rym: Yeah.

343
00:17:45,703 --> 00:17:48,060
Rym: But all that aside, you know, Left 4 Dead is still great.

344
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:48,682
Rym: I got to play.

345
00:17:48,702 --> 00:17:51,860
Rym: I haven't played it as much as I should have played in a long time.

346
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:58,738
Scott: But you know what I kind of like about Left 4 Dead is it's sort of like a lot of the FPS I play, like a Counter Strike or an NS.

347
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,640
Scott: You know, you don't really shoot a lot.

348
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,700
Scott: You know, that's why people like Siege mode in NS, because you get to shoot a lot.

349
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:05,061
Rym: Yep.

350
00:18:05,121 --> 00:18:08,220
Rym: Siege mode is one I can go fade a hundred times.

351
00:18:08,341 --> 00:18:08,663
Rym: Right.

352
00:18:09,025 --> 00:18:11,160
Scott: Or, you know, get an HMG and just hold the button down.

353
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:15,547
Scott: So Left 4 Dead is that game where you get to freakin go doom, doom, doom, doom with a shotgun.

354
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:16,379
Scott: And I kind of like that.

355
00:18:16,921 --> 00:18:18,218
Scott: And sometimes you need that kind of FPS.

356
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,300
Rym: Plus, I still have such a game hard.

357
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,200
Rym: I mean, what are the things that give me a hard on in gaming?

358
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,239
Rym: Asymmetry and co-op.

359
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:25,044
Scott: There you go.

360
00:18:25,306 --> 00:18:27,000
Rym: And this game is asymmetric co-op.

361
00:18:27,261 --> 00:18:28,500
Rym: Like, oh, my God.

362
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:31,120
Rym: And I'm so excited about Left 4 Dead 2.

363
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,040
Rym: Like, I'm just going to like, I'm going to get the take.

364
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:33,625
Scott: I'll preorder.

365
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:35,060
Rym: Yeah, I'll reload on Steam.

366
00:18:35,241 --> 00:18:35,381
Rym: Yeah.

367
00:18:35,422 --> 00:18:39,666
Rym: Well, I think as GeekNights, we should probably have like a so-called release party.

368
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:40,440
Scott: Well, you don't even need.

369
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,520
Scott: You know that as soon as the game comes out, everyone's going to install it immediately.

370
00:18:43,942 --> 00:18:49,900
Scott: And that night you're going to go on Steam and the friends list is going to be like completely full of people all playing Left 4 Dead 2 all the way down.

371
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:50,142
Rym: Yeah.

372
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:51,480
Rym: But I only want to play with the good people.

373
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,364
Scott: That's all right.

374
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:57,840
Rym: But I do have to give a tiny shout out because, you know, at PAX, we did the Losing Should Be Fun panel.

375
00:18:58,582 --> 00:19:03,223
Rym: And I told that anecdote at the very end of the panel, tell my story that like Left 4 Dead anecdote.

376
00:19:03,745 --> 00:19:06,679
Rym: And I totally just stole that directly from one of my co-workers.

377
00:19:06,699 --> 00:19:07,899
Rym: that happened to him and not me.

378
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:08,568
Rym: Anthony.

379
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:09,100
Rym: All right.

380
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:14,060
Rym: I got to give him a shout out because I I just want to see the show kind of off and on.

381
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,079
Rym: I'll know if he listens now because he'll say something at work.

382
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:20,816
Scott: Hey, dude, if you're listening, don't say anything that way.

383
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,096
Scott: It's like ha ha ha.

384
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:28,720
Rym: Or you could say something and then I'll act like you didn't back here.

385
00:19:29,182 --> 00:19:33,364
Scott: Oh, I just came up with like one more example from Scribblenauts is something that really bothered me.

386
00:19:33,886 --> 00:19:36,520
Scott: There was a nasty wolf and I needed to get around him.

387
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,021
Scott: Right.

388
00:19:37,102 --> 00:19:39,000
Rym: Did you type Little Red Riding Hood in feeder to him?

389
00:19:39,181 --> 00:19:41,339
Scott: No, I mean, I made a steak.

390
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:45,240
Scott: He ate it and then I walked over to him and he was still pissed off.

391
00:19:45,761 --> 00:19:50,084
Scott: So I then I gave myself I was holding a steak and I walked over and I fed it to him and petted him.

392
00:19:50,286 --> 00:19:50,507
Scott: Didn't?

393
00:19:50,548 --> 00:19:52,040
Scott: he still pissed off and still ate me.

394
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:52,727
Scott: It's like, come on.

395
00:19:52,768 --> 00:19:53,819
Scott: This doesn't make any sense.

396
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,497
Rym: Just keep giving him steak.

397
00:19:56,221 --> 00:19:57,040
Rym: It didn't matter.

398
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,700
Scott: It's like you can give him a million steaks.

399
00:19:58,821 --> 00:20:00,459
Scott: So to shoot him, then that's what I did.

400
00:20:00,762 --> 00:20:02,079
Scott: And that's the thing is like the game.

401
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,699
Scott: It's like it didn't want to shoot him.

402
00:20:04,062 --> 00:20:06,254
Scott: But the game was pretty much like, yeah, you're not.

403
00:20:06,335 --> 00:20:07,280
Scott: you pretty much had to shoot him.

404
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,079
Scott: So I got my shotgun and it blew his brains out.

405
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:11,719
Scott: You know, it's like the game didn't give me another choice.

406
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:12,887
Rym: You know what?

407
00:20:12,928 --> 00:20:13,920
Rym: You know what I think needs to happen?

408
00:20:14,542 --> 00:20:15,908
Rym: I think it's very obvious.

409
00:20:16,009 --> 00:20:19,760
Scott: I put a cage around it, but then I couldn't climb over the cage without making another object.

410
00:20:20,062 --> 00:20:22,720
Scott: And the idea is to solve it with as few objects as possible.

411
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,359
Rym: Someone should just make a complete knock off flash game.

412
00:20:28,184 --> 00:20:29,200
Rym: Just call it something else.

413
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:31,100
Scott: Yeah, I mean, we made flash portal.

414
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,104
Scott: Why not scribble nuts?

415
00:20:32,145 --> 00:20:40,560
Scott: How easy would it be to I mean, just make it a better game and crowdsource the objects, let people program the objects with all sorts of behaviors.

416
00:20:42,062 --> 00:20:42,627
Rym: Oh, well, we'll see.

417
00:20:42,949 --> 00:20:44,280
Rym: But I do want to talk a little bit, too.

418
00:20:44,561 --> 00:20:48,836
Rym: There's other news, all the cars, you know, this console generation, like.

419
00:20:49,338 --> 00:20:51,999
Rym: it's weird how we get so used to the way gaming works.

420
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:58,540
Rym: Like when I was young, I remember there's the Atari and the NES came out and the SNES and the N64 and the GameCube.

421
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,680
Rym: And like there was this very specific chronology.

422
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:06,720
Rym: And like I always everyone in the gaming world, like you felt when the next set of consoles was coming before it was even announced or anything.

423
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,960
Rym: And there was this like unspoken cycle.

424
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:13,560
Scott: Well, it's because all the gaming magazines would show all these like, you know, they'd be like, oh, man, Ultra 64.

425
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,360
Scott: And they'd show all this stuff that like barely even existed yet.

426
00:21:16,741 --> 00:21:29,423
Scott: You know, notice that's one thing is like back in the day you would look and like, you know, the game pros or whatever, and you see all these like crazy, crazy, crazy previews of like consoles that like were like in development, like a couple of years in advance.

427
00:21:29,564 --> 00:21:32,340
Rym: Yeah, I remember looking at like Project Dolphin and being wild.

428
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,024
Scott: Exactly.

429
00:21:33,045 --> 00:21:33,940
Scott: Exactly what I'm talking about.

430
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:39,321
Scott: But nowadays, everyone keeps every all the cards wicked close to the chest until it's done.

431
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:42,239
Rym: And then they show it to, of course, back then, who is Nintendo competing against?

432
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,442
Rym: No one.

433
00:21:43,784 --> 00:21:51,699
Scott: No, but even that, you know, Sony would see stuff and, you know, no one plays the cards, you know, as far away from the chest as they used to.

434
00:21:51,921 --> 00:21:53,119
Rym: I think there are a lot of reasons for that.

435
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,689
Rym: But you got to admit that right around.

436
00:21:55,749 --> 00:22:03,978
Rym: now is when I would expect in the old world to be seeing like the rumblings of the PlayStation for the Xbox 980 or whatever.

437
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:11,680
Scott: Apparently, like, you know, like I heard some talk from, you know, big people in the industry, like, you know, retailers and GameStop guys and whatever.

438
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:19,320
Scott: And usually the way it would work is like if a new console was coming, they would tell like the GameStop people and such like two years in advance, you know.

439
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:24,623
Scott: So apparently they say they haven't heard anything yet, which tells me this console cycle is going to last.

440
00:22:24,783 --> 00:22:29,662
Scott: I think don't hesitate to buy like a slim PS3 or a 360 or a Wii if you want one.

441
00:22:29,742 --> 00:22:35,640
Rym: The thing is, it's weird because I still I feel viscerally like buying an Xbox now would be a waste because the next one is going to come.

442
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,279
Rym: But at the same time, it's not going to come.

443
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,900
Rym: This console is like like I think everything's changing now.

444
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,320
Rym: And part of it's the tech.

445
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,840
Rym: I mean, what technology has changed?

446
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:44,884
Rym: What's going to be better?

447
00:22:44,965 --> 00:22:48,464
Rym: Like if they made the new Xbox now, what could it really do differently?

448
00:22:48,806 --> 00:22:50,620
Rym: Yeah, it's not going to do anything different.

449
00:22:50,982 --> 00:22:51,979
Rym: And what's Nintendo going to do?

450
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:52,584
Rym: They're going to wait.

451
00:22:52,624 --> 00:22:53,007
Rym: They're not.

452
00:22:53,028 --> 00:22:54,560
Rym: they don't care about making a next gen console.

453
00:22:54,721 --> 00:22:56,560
Rym: The Wii is making money hand over fucking fist.

454
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:56,901
Scott: Yeah.

455
00:22:56,921 --> 00:22:59,100
Scott: And it's like they could just keep making accessories for the Wii.

456
00:22:59,180 --> 00:22:59,932
Scott: They don't give a shit.

457
00:23:00,216 --> 00:23:00,399
Rym: Yeah.

458
00:23:00,721 --> 00:23:03,120
Rym: And Sony, that was supposed to be the 10 year console anyway.

459
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:03,443
Rym: They're not.

460
00:23:03,463 --> 00:23:04,840
Rym: they can't make a new PlayStation.

461
00:23:05,102 --> 00:23:06,377
Scott: Now they're not at all.

462
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:09,300
Rym: So we're not going to see consoles for a while.

463
00:23:09,402 --> 00:23:10,600
Rym: And now we're getting to that point.

464
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,600
Rym: Look, we're getting all the price drops, the Wii, the Xbox, the PlayStation.

465
00:23:13,961 --> 00:23:17,140
Scott: If you're thinking about getting some more consoles than you got, now's the time.

466
00:23:17,261 --> 00:23:18,560
Rym: They're all dropping in price now.

467
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:23,708
Rym: But in the past, that was like the last hurrah before the new console started appearing on the horizon.

468
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:25,020
Rym: Yeah, I don't think it is.

469
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:30,780
Rym: I think this is just all of them jockeying that even more market share and make more money now that their hardware is more commodity.

470
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,374
Scott: And you know, I think, you know, I was my plan was I'm not.

471
00:23:33,555 --> 00:23:35,106
Scott: you know, why should I get a 360?

472
00:23:35,106 --> 00:23:36,660
Scott: Because I don't have an HDTV.

473
00:23:36,781 --> 00:23:37,484
Scott: So what's the point?

474
00:23:38,027 --> 00:23:40,260
Scott: But now there's a deal going down.

475
00:23:40,581 --> 00:23:46,986
Scott: You can get an elite 360, the best possible one for only 250 with a fifty dollar mail in rebate.

476
00:23:47,067 --> 00:23:48,499
Scott: I'm just going to do it probably after the show.

477
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:53,041
Rym: The thing is, I mean, come on that the only reason I won't because I don't have an HDTV yet.

478
00:23:53,242 --> 00:23:57,443
Rym: And if I get that house, I'm going to spend more money building the new GeekNights studio.

479
00:23:57,463 --> 00:24:00,180
Rym: I'm not going to have money to spend like an Xbox just right away.

480
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:06,480
Scott: And it's like I've already got two wireless 360 controllers for my computer and an Xbox 360 wireless headset for my computer.

481
00:24:06,884 --> 00:24:08,160
Scott: And they work with the 360.

482
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,640
Scott: So it's like I've already spent the money on the controllers.

483
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:13,259
Scott: I'll just be enhancing stuff I've already got.

484
00:24:13,782 --> 00:24:19,580
Scott: And there's already like a mostly I just want to play like the arcade games, like there aren't really that many 360.

485
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,880
Rym: There are those little things that the Xbox does really well.

486
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,218
Rym: Like there's that Netflix on demand thing where you can watch Netflix and set up a chat with one of your friends and watch the same movie synced up.

487
00:24:28,601 --> 00:24:29,167
Scott: That's all right.

488
00:24:29,207 --> 00:24:30,359
Rym: Just weird little things like that.

489
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,820
Rym: Plus, you know, Adam's got his Xbox.

490
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,938
Rym: You can play those co-op games.

491
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,780
Scott: Yeah, that's all right.

492
00:24:35,081 --> 00:24:37,000
Scott: I'd rather play the local co-op type games.

493
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:37,662
Scott: Yeah.

494
00:24:37,682 --> 00:24:40,320
Rym: The thing is, I'm sorry.

495
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,640
Rym: Split screen is bullshit.

496
00:24:43,066 --> 00:24:43,898
Scott: Well, you get two TVs.

497
00:24:44,642 --> 00:24:45,011
Rym: You have one.

498
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,180
Rym: Are you going to have two HDTVs in your house?

499
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,318
Scott: I got a monitor is HD.

500
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:52,938
Rym: So you can have someone's going to play on your little monitor and you're going to play on the big HDTV.

501
00:24:53,883 --> 00:24:54,694
Scott: You know, whatever.

502
00:24:54,734 --> 00:24:55,140
Scott: It's all right.

503
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,980
Scott: It's like I. mostly I want it for the arcade games and stuff.

504
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:58,823
Scott: You know, I don't really.

505
00:24:58,843 --> 00:25:02,985
Scott: I don't really actually see myself buying that many 360 games on disk, if any.

506
00:25:03,469 --> 00:25:04,960
Scott: Like I'm not going to buy any halos.

507
00:25:05,441 --> 00:25:07,318
Scott: I'm not going to buy any Gears of War's.

508
00:25:07,921 --> 00:25:08,899
Scott: You know, what am I going to buy?

509
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:10,920
Rym: I could buy a few games like that just to play.

510
00:25:11,061 --> 00:25:13,420
Rym: I would definitely the Soul Calibur, the new Soul Calibur.

511
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:14,499
Scott: Yeah, I wouldn't buy that.

512
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,145
Rym: Why not?

513
00:25:15,246 --> 00:25:16,840
Rym: It's the best fighting game in the world right now.

514
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:17,705
Scott: No, it's not.

515
00:25:17,826 --> 00:25:19,340
Rym: Name a better fighting game.

516
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:25,286
Scott: I would actually rather have like the Street Fighter for our name or the Tatsunoko versus Capcom.

517
00:25:25,447 --> 00:25:26,879
Rym: That's cool, but I don't think it's better.

518
00:25:27,722 --> 00:25:29,559
Rym: That's my not from a fighting game perspective.

519
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,545
Scott: I like Soul Calibur.

520
00:25:30,565 --> 00:25:31,190
Scott: I mean, is there any?

521
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:32,600
Scott: I don't need a newer one.

522
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,240
Rym: I think you're just a curmudgeon here because it's on the GameCube.

523
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,460
Rym: I mean, three GameCube controllers.

524
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,589
Scott: Much better for it anyway.

525
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:38,840
Rym: I agree on that point.

526
00:25:39,201 --> 00:25:44,564
Rym: And I agree that Soul Calibur three was not better than two in any way before is just better.

527
00:25:45,456 --> 00:25:45,800
Scott: Whatever.

528
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,123
Scott: Whatever.

529
00:25:47,183 --> 00:25:51,144
Scott: I'm mostly getting the arcade games that don't exist for the you know, because that's the other thing is like.

530
00:25:51,184 --> 00:25:56,260
Scott: I played Braid recently on the PC, you know, and I got stuff to say about that game later.

531
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:02,380
Rym: Yeah, I got to play it enough to talk about it, but I think I know I got it because it was five bucks on Steam.

532
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,978
Rym: I think I know what I have to say, but I got to play through it to to fully.

533
00:26:06,058 --> 00:26:07,359
Scott: you can play through my room if you want.

534
00:26:07,561 --> 00:26:07,964
Rym: Yeah, I could.

535
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:10,620
Rym: I might just buy five bucks, but I don't think it's five bucks anymore.

536
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,598
Scott: I got a steam sale.

537
00:26:11,961 --> 00:26:15,040
Rym: Oh, well, check it will trade because I got some steam games you don't have.

538
00:26:15,383 --> 00:26:16,840
Rym: We can like log into each other's steam account.

539
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,230
Scott: What do you got?

540
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,238
Rym: I got to have live source.

541
00:26:21,062 --> 00:26:21,606
Scott: That's the only.

542
00:26:21,647 --> 00:26:23,300
Scott: that's the only valve game I don't have.

543
00:26:23,521 --> 00:26:25,840
Rym: Yeah, I guess what I just happened to buy.

544
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:32,239
Scott: It's preloaded because I have like mods for it that do work like, you know, like I think I have day of defeat source or something.

545
00:26:32,961 --> 00:26:33,562
Scott: I don't even know.

546
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:42,400
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

547
00:26:42,781 --> 00:26:46,919
Rym: So if you go to Kotaku, you've definitely already seen this, but I got to talk about it.

548
00:26:47,441 --> 00:26:53,200
Rym: There's a concept in Japan, the the upending of the tea table or the Chabudai Geishi.

549
00:26:54,022 --> 00:26:54,769
Rym: And that is the.

550
00:26:55,012 --> 00:26:55,819
Rym: you're pissed off.

551
00:26:56,121 --> 00:26:58,117
Rym: You flip over the little tea table and run away in anger.

552
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,340
Rym: You know, you hit it, you flip it over.

553
00:27:00,781 --> 00:27:04,440
Scott: It is known in the United States, especially in New York, as the Ukraine is weak.

554
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:05,998
Rym: Ah, the Ukraine.

555
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:16,909
Rym: So Japan loves to make arcade games that are basically just one concept like, you know, those are the money games in America like DDR was big for a while and then it wasn't popular anymore.

556
00:27:16,949 --> 00:27:18,060
Rym: And then there are all the knockoffs.

557
00:27:19,062 --> 00:27:23,356
Rym: And in Japan, they make so many of these like tactile games like.

558
00:27:23,396 --> 00:27:32,740
Rym: that is the one area that an arcade will always win out of our consoles is having the very specific durable peripheral designed specifically for one game.

559
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,938
Rym: And that's the only thing it's for.

560
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:37,100
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you go to the Japanese arcade, they got gun games.

561
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,300
Scott: We have gun games, but they've also got like games where he's like a camera and you're taking pictures.

562
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,259
Rym: Pokemon Snap.

563
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,162
Scott: Yeah, they got.

564
00:27:43,202 --> 00:27:48,960
Scott: well, they got games like you got collectible cards that you put down on a surface and then like you move them around.

565
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:52,860
Rym: They've also got all these weird games like the poke the guy in the butt game.

566
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,538
Scott: Yeah, the Bunga Bunga, whatever it is.

567
00:27:54,820 --> 00:28:00,480
Rym: Well, the slipping over the tea table on games is possibly my favorite one of these.

568
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:04,925
Rym: I mean, so far that you've there's definitely a line like some of these games are just a novelty.

569
00:28:04,945 --> 00:28:05,859
Rym: Like you play it once.

570
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,238
Rym: Maybe you play it one more time to your friend and that's it.

571
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,520
Rym: And they only make money for the novelty like it's there.

572
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,539
Rym: Everyone plays at once.

573
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,083
Rym: And that's it.

574
00:28:13,769 --> 00:28:14,999
Rym: Or, you know, people will walk in.

575
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:15,723
Rym: They may be played.

576
00:28:15,783 --> 00:28:24,740
Rym: But then there are the actual games like DDR or Tyco Drum Master, where it is a game you can practice and get better at this pissed off tea table game.

577
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:30,379
Rym: You basically sit there and they're like other people on the screen sitting around the table and you have this actual table.

578
00:28:31,281 --> 00:28:36,766
Rym: And as these people piss you off, you bang on the table at the right times, you know, as though you're angry.

579
00:28:36,887 --> 00:28:38,727
Scott: Yeah, it's a game about getting the high score.

580
00:28:38,767 --> 00:28:39,500
Scott: It's one of those kinds.

581
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:39,721
Scott: Yes.

582
00:28:39,741 --> 00:28:42,000
Rym: You bang on the table in different regard.

583
00:28:42,401 --> 00:28:46,380
Rym: And then when you're fed up, you flip the table over and it actually flips over.

584
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,428
Rym: There's a table and you flip the controller.

585
00:28:48,569 --> 00:28:54,440
Scott: is this table like it's a little table that's in front of you and you bang on it and then you flip it over and that's the game.

586
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,200
Rym: I got to say, I watched the video of this dude playing in Japan.

587
00:28:57,802 --> 00:29:00,019
Rym: And for one, there are a lot of these machines.

588
00:29:00,381 --> 00:29:03,559
Scott: Well, they were at the Tokyo Arcade Game Show.

589
00:29:04,122 --> 00:29:10,880
Rym: But to the guy playing it, he had the look of one of those kids who's really good at DDR walking around the DVR machine.

590
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:16,679
Rym: You know, that look like they walk up, they kind of stand behind the machine like, all right, I'm going to go, I'm going to go.

591
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,120
Rym: They like they put their hand on their face like, all right, let's do this.

592
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:23,638
Rym: Like they're psyching themselves up and he stands there and he like does a little finger thing like he's ready to go.

593
00:29:24,141 --> 00:29:28,602
Rym: And he's totally like timing it and like totally rocking out on this pissed off tea table game.

594
00:29:29,023 --> 00:29:30,329
Scott: Yeah, no, that was at the.

595
00:29:30,409 --> 00:29:31,313
Scott: I get the name of the.

596
00:29:31,454 --> 00:29:34,000
Scott: it's basically the trade show for arcade games in Japan.

597
00:29:34,081 --> 00:29:35,939
Scott: So that's why you see so many of the machines there.

598
00:29:36,201 --> 00:29:40,223
Rym: Yeah, the game center doesn't have that many machines, but you look at the pictures of the game centers.

599
00:29:40,283 --> 00:29:44,959
Rym: I see the same thing, like a wall of one kind of game, then a wall of pachinko, then a wall of another kind of game.

600
00:29:45,662 --> 00:29:46,245
Scott: I got arcades.

601
00:29:46,286 --> 00:29:48,479
Scott: probably could have one of those, not a whole wall of them.

602
00:29:49,281 --> 00:29:52,339
Rym: They have a host club, a wedding party, an office and a living room.

603
00:29:52,841 --> 00:29:55,260
Scott: Oh, man, the host club's got to be fun in the home stage.

604
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,659
Scott: You get pissed off in the host club.

605
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,280
Rym: You host your family members get more.

606
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,100
Rym: They complain and get more and more annoying.

607
00:30:01,181 --> 00:30:02,259
Rym: So you bang on the table.

608
00:30:03,863 --> 00:30:05,059
Rym: So Japanese, I know.

609
00:30:05,502 --> 00:30:06,212
Rym: Good God.

610
00:30:06,232 --> 00:30:06,800
Rym: So Japanese.

611
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:07,904
Rym: I want to play.

612
00:30:08,024 --> 00:30:08,808
Scott: I mean, that's like.

613
00:30:08,928 --> 00:30:16,580
Scott: I mean, it's one thing to be stereotypically racist against some other, you know, ethnicity or whatever, but Japan against yourself.

614
00:30:16,742 --> 00:30:17,740
Scott: I mean, come on, Japan.

615
00:30:18,261 --> 00:30:24,965
Rym: Japan is a wonderful felicity for making like self referentially humorous games like this.

616
00:30:25,047 --> 00:30:25,699
Rym: I mean, look at it.

617
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:32,920
Scott: It's like, look at Japanese people saying, you know, it's like if we were Americans, we'd be like, haha, look at fat, stupid American way.

618
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:33,503
Scott: That is us.

619
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:35,478
Scott: The Japanese like, haha.

620
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,000
Scott: Look at sad salary man with angry family.

621
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:38,923
Scott: Oh, wait, that is me.

622
00:30:42,557 --> 00:30:43,359
Rym: So what do you got for me?

623
00:30:43,841 --> 00:30:48,807
Scott: So, you know, one thing that, you know, people sort of have a hard time understanding with technologies.

624
00:30:48,827 --> 00:30:50,340
Scott: and yes, it's Tuesday, but you know what?

625
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,679
Scott: Technology Monday, people already know this kind of thing.

626
00:30:52,880 --> 00:31:00,020
Scott: And it is gaming related, you know, is exactly like, you know, where the line is between software and hardware.

627
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:00,321
Scott: Right.

628
00:31:00,341 --> 00:31:06,163
Scott: It's like I type things in on the screen and somehow it makes metal chips talk with electricity.

629
00:31:06,223 --> 00:31:13,640
Scott: And it's like how the actual spot at where those two things meet is sort of very, very hard to conceptualize in your brain.

630
00:31:13,741 --> 00:31:15,059
Scott: Like, how does it work?

631
00:31:15,281 --> 00:31:15,863
Scott: Like, really?

632
00:31:16,004 --> 00:31:19,860
Scott: And like a lot of people just can't get their head around it.

633
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,312
Scott: It took me a very long time to finally understand.

634
00:31:22,332 --> 00:31:27,479
Scott: that is one of the things that I paid a very large amount of money to learn in college and eventually did learn.

635
00:31:28,342 --> 00:31:29,880
Scott: But here I have a video for you.

636
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:36,139
Scott: It's very long, right, is from Google and it is from NAND to Tetris in 12 steps.

637
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:51,140
Scott: And this guy basically gives a big, fancy lecture and he explains to you how you get from NAND gates, which is like this very simple electronic component that is the basis of modern computing, all the way up to a game of Tetris and every step in between.

638
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:58,500
Rym: It is the most simple, not from the logical perspective, but from the actually making it out of electronics is the simplest one.

639
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:58,920
Scott: Yes.

640
00:31:59,403 --> 00:32:04,740
Scott: So, you know, this is going to show you pretty much in a way that I hope you can understand if you watch it and pay attention.

641
00:32:05,321 --> 00:32:17,340
Scott: You know, a lot of the things that I tried to teach people when we had those how to computers work episodes, you know, how do you get all the way from electrons going right all the way up to a game of Tetris?

642
00:32:18,022 --> 00:32:19,619
Scott: And, you know, what's going on?

643
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,260
Scott: How where is software?

644
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,150
Scott: Where is hardware?

645
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:22,819
Scott: How do they talk?

646
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:29,424
Scott: How does programs actually run on CPUs, instructions, assembly language, all those layers there?

647
00:32:29,645 --> 00:32:42,200
Scott: And so if you are interested in technology, you know, or anything along these lines, this is a very, very, very, very good thing that you should watch, even though it is considerably long, you know, long for an Internet thing.

648
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,900
Scott: But I mean, for a lecture, I mean, it's like sitting in one college lecture.

649
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:45,423
Scott: Big deal.

650
00:32:46,348 --> 00:32:48,139
Rym: I didn't really sit through many college lectures.

651
00:32:48,544 --> 00:32:49,860
Rym: Oh, all right.

652
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:53,760
Rym: So it is time for that new bit we've added, the meta minute.

653
00:32:54,302 --> 00:32:54,725
Scott: Meta minute.

654
00:32:54,826 --> 00:32:55,955
Scott: OK, meta moment.

655
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,040
Scott: Meta moment number one this weekend.

656
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,099
Scott: What's this weekend's dates?

657
00:33:02,121 --> 00:33:04,020
Rym: The 20 I don't have already.

658
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:13,643
Rym: OK, anyway, what days there are this weekend, 26th and 27th New York Anime Festival 2009.

659
00:33:13,643 --> 00:33:14,932
Rym: Yes, the 25th and 26th Friday and Saturday.

660
00:33:16,181 --> 00:33:17,914
Rym: We will be there both nights doing anime.

661
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,596
Rym: Everyone should see Colin cover your bases and know your creators.

662
00:33:22,656 --> 00:33:23,480
Rym: do anime panels.

663
00:33:24,141 --> 00:33:30,120
Scott: There's also Yoshiki Tomino, the director of Gundam, creator of Gundam, period.

664
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,580
Scott: Like Gundam period.

665
00:33:31,822 --> 00:33:32,285
Scott: He made it.

666
00:33:32,507 --> 00:33:34,139
Scott: That guy is going to be there.

667
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,131
Rym: Wouldn't that be just motor?

668
00:33:35,212 --> 00:33:35,800
Rym: OK, sorry.

669
00:33:36,302 --> 00:33:37,275
Rym: No, never mind.

670
00:33:37,295 --> 00:33:37,478
Rym: Right.

671
00:33:38,041 --> 00:33:41,600
Scott: He has a pan keynote on Friday.

672
00:33:41,701 --> 00:33:42,590
Scott: That's a five ish.

673
00:33:42,691 --> 00:33:43,580
Scott: I'm going to try to see that.

674
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:45,100
Scott: And I think he's got a Q&A Saturday.

675
00:33:45,321 --> 00:33:48,639
Scott: I didn't look at the whole schedule very carefully, but I saw that at least.

676
00:33:49,381 --> 00:33:51,919
Scott: So I would recommend trying to hit those events up.

677
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,480
Scott: Also, we'll probably be spending some time there on Saturday.

678
00:33:54,942 --> 00:33:58,479
Scott: You know, besides our panel, you know, to hang out, meet people, whatever.

679
00:33:58,761 --> 00:33:58,963
Rym: Yep.

680
00:33:59,003 --> 00:34:00,620
Rym: So post in the forum or tweet or whatever.

681
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,678
Rym: Just let us know you'll be there.

682
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:07,000
Scott: And if you're at the place, you know, come to our panels or look for us walking around.

683
00:34:07,461 --> 00:34:08,920
Scott: Look for pictures of us on the Internet.

684
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:16,098
Rym: But yes, seven thirty on Friday, Friday, seven thirty, panel three and Saturday seven forty five, panel three.

685
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,230
Scott: There you go.

686
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:18,080
Scott: Panel three, both time.

687
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,920
Rym: We're not going to be there Sunday.

688
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:24,080
Rym: Some we can't say yet, but something we might be doing something really, really cool.

689
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,618
Scott: And I have a lot of shit to do.

690
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,799
Scott: I haven't had a free week.

691
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:27,844
Scott: Pax.

692
00:34:28,085 --> 00:34:30,219
Scott: What was the weekend after Pax game?

693
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:31,760
Scott: I had you had family.

694
00:34:32,121 --> 00:34:33,820
Rym: You had families, family shit.

695
00:34:33,982 --> 00:34:35,580
Rym: And everyone else was sick with the swine flu.

696
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,699
Scott: Everyone else is like a sign flu.

697
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:40,860
Scott: The weekend after that we had it was a game weekend and we had like picnics and everything.

698
00:34:40,981 --> 00:34:43,639
Rym: And you had to go home and I went and it was Rosh Hashanah.

699
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:44,223
Scott: Right.

700
00:34:44,264 --> 00:34:46,100
Scott: This weekend, New York and a festival.

701
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:50,639
Scott: I have not had a fucking free weekend and I'm not going to have one for like fuck ever.

702
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,839
Scott: There's like weddings coming up and gotten up.

703
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,540
Scott: But seriously, we need a weekend at home to do nothing.

704
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:56,264
Scott: Get away from me.

705
00:34:56,445 --> 00:34:58,860
Rym: We might be doing something really cool on Sunday.

706
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,680
Rym: And if it happens, we'll tell you all about it.

707
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:01,304
Rym: It'll be video.

708
00:35:01,485 --> 00:35:01,726
Scott: Yeah.

709
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:03,700
Scott: But if it doesn't happen, we'll never speak of this again.

710
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:07,000
Scott: I just pretended, you know, we don't want to speak about something that doesn't happen.

711
00:35:07,201 --> 00:35:08,280
Scott: You know, that would be shit talking.

712
00:35:09,501 --> 00:35:20,399
Rym: And, you know, going forward, just kind of a long term metabid, as you know, the New York Comic-Con, New York Anime Festival, we talked about this on the last Wednesday show, are combined in 2010, the next, you know, set of this.

713
00:35:21,241 --> 00:35:24,040
Rym: And the New York Comic-Con has been really extending its gaming content.

714
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:32,540
Rym: So we can't tell you what we'll be doing yet, but there is going to be a lot of gaming stuff at the New York Comic-Con and we will probably be a big part of it.

715
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:38,700
Scott: Oh, and the ad contest, I guess I'll get no one's really entered the ad contest, even though, you know, since I've been mentioning on the show.

716
00:35:38,821 --> 00:35:40,299
Scott: So I think it's pretty much over with.

717
00:35:41,061 --> 00:35:48,279
Scott: If I don't get any applications by the end of the week, then I will announce the winner on next week's Wednesday show.

718
00:35:49,124 --> 00:35:49,368
Scott: Right.

719
00:35:49,408 --> 00:35:49,632
Scott: Yeah.

720
00:35:49,652 --> 00:35:50,200
Scott: It's Tuesday.

721
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,500
Scott: So this week's Tuesday, Thursday.

722
00:35:52,182 --> 00:35:52,423
Scott: Yeah.

723
00:35:52,443 --> 00:35:55,840
Scott: So next week's Wednesday show, I will announce the winner of the ad contest.

724
00:35:56,201 --> 00:36:05,300
Scott: So you have until I guess next Tuesday to send in a submission and just go to the website and you will see all about that in the forum.

725
00:36:05,582 --> 00:36:08,260
Scott: There's a thread about it in the news section on our website.

726
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,392
Scott: There's talk about it.

727
00:36:09,494 --> 00:36:09,919
Scott: It's all good.

728
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:16,380
Rym: And also PAX East is coming up next March, right around the same time as Anime Boston.

729
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,300
Scott: Let's stick with the nearby conventions.

730
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,460
Scott: Not the meta, you know, millennium, the meta-millennium.

731
00:36:23,604 --> 00:36:23,946
Scott: All right.

732
00:36:24,187 --> 00:36:26,460
Rym: So add PAX, the most recent PAX.

733
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,660
Scott: Well, I think the story actually begins before that.

734
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,820
Rym: You want to begin at the very beginning.

735
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:30,803
Scott: Yes.

736
00:36:30,823 --> 00:36:35,804
Scott: So back when I was, you know, a kid, I played Magic the Gathering, right, in middle school mostly.

737
00:36:36,448 --> 00:36:38,280
Scott: And I realized, man, this is stupid.

738
00:36:38,524 --> 00:36:39,620
Scott: It's all this collectible crap.

739
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:43,802
Scott: I hate it, you know, and I sort of got over the collectible crap in college once and for all.

740
00:36:44,105 --> 00:36:45,760
Scott: Thanks to that Mac or your miniature crap.

741
00:36:46,123 --> 00:36:46,487
Scott: All right.

742
00:36:46,852 --> 00:36:47,580
Scott: Which is a big mistake.

743
00:36:47,923 --> 00:36:49,900
Scott: And I realized, yeah, collectible games are crap.

744
00:36:50,401 --> 00:36:57,380
Scott: But the thing is, Magic the Gathering, if money to wasting, if it were not collectible, could be a pretty good game.

745
00:36:57,521 --> 00:37:01,200
Scott: And but the thing is, all the games like that were collectible.

746
00:37:01,461 --> 00:37:06,966
Scott: And I said, man, wouldn't it be cool if there was some sort of customizable card game that was not collectible?

747
00:37:07,449 --> 00:37:09,120
Scott: And I waited for this game to come along.

748
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:14,280
Scott: More recently, someone said, hey, the game has come along, it's called Dominion.

749
00:37:14,923 --> 00:37:16,580
Scott: And I said, oh, wow, it's come along.

750
00:37:16,681 --> 00:37:20,200
Scott: And then I saw on BoardGameGeek, this game Dominion just rose through the charts.

751
00:37:20,301 --> 00:37:21,799
Scott: And I'm like, oh, look at that.

752
00:37:22,442 --> 00:37:23,839
Scott: I'll have to get my hands on some of that.

753
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:24,401
Rym: Yep.

754
00:37:24,422 --> 00:37:26,559
Rym: So we had the opportunity to, you know, we're at a con.

755
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,459
Scott: We're at Anime Boston.

756
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,447
Rym: Yeah, we grab in.

757
00:37:28,468 --> 00:37:29,600
Rym: We're like, let's learn how to play it.

758
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,279
Rym: So we went through the rules and we're looking at this deck.

759
00:37:32,382 --> 00:37:33,780
Rym: And Scott, like, he finished reading the rules.

760
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:34,879
Rym: He's like, this looks kind of shitty.

761
00:37:35,122 --> 00:37:35,751
Rym: So I'm like, all right.

762
00:37:35,772 --> 00:37:36,320
Rym: So I read through.

763
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:37,780
Scott: It's like, you know, we were in Anime Boston.

764
00:37:37,961 --> 00:37:42,479
Scott: We didn't have a lot of time to really sit and be quiet and careful and really try it.

765
00:37:42,921 --> 00:37:45,960
Scott: You know, so I sort of read the rules and they were kind of bland.

766
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:48,440
Scott: I was like, I don't know if this is a good game.

767
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:55,300
Scott: I don't know what is this one of those, you know, mistakes like everyone loves Ra, you know, but it's like way up on BoardGameGeek.

768
00:37:55,421 --> 00:38:00,720
Rym: But we know it's just the Egyptian slot machine or Twilight Struggle, which is a pretty good game, but it takes so much investment.

769
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:01,837
Rym: It's almost not worth it.

770
00:38:04,142 --> 00:38:05,480
Rym: And Battlelore, which is just shit.

771
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:06,067
Rym: I'm sorry.

772
00:38:06,107 --> 00:38:06,900
Rym: That game is terrible.

773
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:10,960
Scott: Yeah, there's a lot of games that are way high in BoardGameGeek that are not good.

774
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,360
Rym: Just, you know, the BoardGameGeek top 10 is still mostly rock solid.

775
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:21,059
Scott: So I didn't pass final judgment on Dominion, but I wasn't going to play it, you know, like rush out to play it.

776
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:21,463
Scott: I was good.

777
00:38:21,564 --> 00:38:23,339
Scott: I sort of was like lukewarm on it.

778
00:38:23,621 --> 00:38:26,020
Scott: I wasn't in a rush to check it out anymore because I read the rules.

779
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:26,522
Rym: Oh, wow.

780
00:38:26,543 --> 00:38:32,780
Rym: Someone calculated that with the current set of Dominion out there, it is impossible for any human to ever play every possible combination.

781
00:38:35,162 --> 00:38:36,359
Scott: We'll explain that in a little bit.

782
00:38:36,841 --> 00:38:42,592
Rym: So, yes, but, you know, we basically going through this game, we decided it just looked like a crappy game and we just didn't.

783
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:43,700
Rym: even we were like, all right, forget this.

784
00:38:43,861 --> 00:38:44,777
Rym: We just forgot about it.

785
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:48,019
Scott: So Pax West, everyone's playing it.

786
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,400
Scott: Everyone is playing Dominion.

787
00:38:49,701 --> 00:38:51,540
Scott: Even Gabe mentioned Dominion.

788
00:38:51,960 --> 00:39:04,960
Scott: The people you would walk around looking at board gaming and just Dominion was by far it was like Dominion and Agricola, I think were the most played game, like walking out of the gaming area and then around and upstairs to the room to do our last panel.

789
00:39:05,421 --> 00:39:09,140
Rym: I saw five separate games of this game going on at the same time.

790
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,220
Scott: Another very popular game was that sushi game.

791
00:39:11,341 --> 00:39:14,319
Scott: But I think there were only a couple sets of it, but I think they were in constant use.

792
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:14,780
Rym: Yeah.

793
00:39:14,801 --> 00:39:15,827
Rym: Jared was really like.

794
00:39:15,847 --> 00:39:20,600
Rym: we were both looking at that and we didn't have time to play it, but we were to look that up on BoardGameGeek after the show anyway.

795
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,800
Scott: So Dominion is being played like crazy.

796
00:39:23,262 --> 00:39:27,546
Scott: And our friend, awesome friend Ro, when she got the Dominion set and they knew how to play.

797
00:39:27,566 --> 00:39:28,380
Scott: So that's perfect.

798
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,382
Scott: You know, nothing better than being at a convention and someone else showing you how to play.

799
00:39:32,402 --> 00:39:36,023
Scott: So you don't have to, you know, read the instructions and waste precious convention time.

800
00:39:36,628 --> 00:39:37,940
Scott: So she showed us how to play.

801
00:39:38,502 --> 00:39:41,980
Scott: And we were like, oh, we were wrong.

802
00:39:42,302 --> 00:39:43,353
Scott: This game is the shit.

803
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:43,879
Scott: And you know what?

804
00:39:44,041 --> 00:39:44,867
Scott: The game is the shit.

805
00:39:45,431 --> 00:39:46,580
Scott: That's pretty much all there is to it.

806
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,082
Scott: End of the show.

807
00:39:47,584 --> 00:39:54,880
Rym: It's basically it's cool because what it is is it's a drafting kind of game where like you'll construct a deck and play with the deck.

808
00:39:55,361 --> 00:40:01,880
Rym: But instead of making your deck ahead of time or following some like rule for making your deck, the deck is made in the course of playing.

809
00:40:01,961 --> 00:40:04,540
Rym: And you're like you're making the deck every round with your actions.

810
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:09,224
Rym: Like you play your money and you get your stuff and you put them in your discard deck and you keep reshuffling.

811
00:40:09,686 --> 00:40:21,458
Rym: So it's not just making the optimal deck, it's making the optimal deck as you go, because the final optimal deck, you might not be able to make that deck because to get to that final optimal state along the way, you'll have every suboptimal deck.

812
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:25,544
Scott: Yeah, it's like in the beginning of the game, you have what, seven dollars and three points, right?

813
00:40:25,845 --> 00:40:29,503
Scott: Points don't do anything, but you want points in your deck because that's how you win.

814
00:40:29,523 --> 00:40:33,699
Scott: That's the only thing that matters is getting point cards in your deck, but they don't do anything.

815
00:40:34,041 --> 00:40:38,796
Scott: So if you just fill your deck with point cards, basically like let's say you do nothing but buy point cards.

816
00:40:38,877 --> 00:40:39,080
Scott: Right.

817
00:40:39,641 --> 00:40:43,981
Scott: OK, so you can't really afford very expensive ones because you only draw five cards at a time.

818
00:40:44,503 --> 00:40:48,179
Scott: So the best case scenario, you draw five dollars, you get a duchy.

819
00:40:48,421 --> 00:40:48,662
Scott: Right.

820
00:40:49,064 --> 00:40:52,240
Scott: So now you've got four, four points and seven dollars.

821
00:40:52,563 --> 00:40:54,380
Scott: Then you got five points and seven dollars.

822
00:40:54,681 --> 00:40:54,821
Scott: Then.

823
00:40:55,082 --> 00:40:55,243
Scott: Right.

824
00:40:55,304 --> 00:40:58,720
Scott: Eventually you're going to be drawing a fistful of useless points.

825
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:04,203
Scott: Meanwhile, someone else who didn't buy points right away is getting lots of money and other stuff.

826
00:41:04,645 --> 00:41:08,940
Scott: And then later in the game, when they have tons of money, they buy even more points in fewer cards.

827
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:12,960
Scott: They buy like the six point cards that is one card worth six points.

828
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,880
Scott: You see how it's all about the proportions of things in your deck.

829
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:21,138
Scott: Like when you make a Magic the Gathering deck, it's like, how many land do I put in and how many other cards do I put in?

830
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:21,581
Scott: Right.

831
00:41:21,642 --> 00:41:33,094
Scott: What's the proportion that you got to have so that you won't draw no land right away and you'll draw enough land as you're going that you'll always have some, you know, it's that kind of thinking only throughout the course of a game.

832
00:41:33,215 --> 00:41:45,893
Scott: early in the game, you got to get more monies and then you got to build up a machine of cards that work together in a combo and you keep reshuffling your deck and drawing the same cards over and over again as the proportions change and you get.

833
00:41:45,993 --> 00:41:50,639
Scott: you make your deck more efficient and more efficient and then you fill it up with point cards and then the game's over.

834
00:41:51,522 --> 00:41:53,360
Rym: Well, let's go all the novel mechanics.

835
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,520
Rym: I mean, one, there's this whole, you know, you victory points.

836
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,939
Rym: The only way to win is with them.

837
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:59,319
Rym: But as you pull them into your deck, you're like diluting your deck.

838
00:41:59,601 --> 00:41:59,822
Rym: Yeah.

839
00:41:59,923 --> 00:42:02,600
Rym: So it's it's a very subtle and nice ketchup mechanism.

840
00:42:03,182 --> 00:42:04,670
Rym: But at the same time, you have the almost the St.

841
00:42:04,711 --> 00:42:14,358
Rym: Petersburg situation where it's a game of whoever switches from money action to victory point first wins unless they switch too soon, in which case they lose.

842
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:14,960
Scott: Yep.

843
00:42:15,844 --> 00:42:20,939
Rym: And you've got this mechanic where every round you draw five cards and you might draw more to other stuff in the course of your turn.

844
00:42:21,502 --> 00:42:25,565
Rym: But no matter what, at the end of every turn, you've discarded everything and you draw five new cards.

845
00:42:26,272 --> 00:42:27,000
Rym: That is huge.

846
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:32,059
Rym: I mean, every card game like this from San Juan Magic and everything grows.

847
00:42:32,099 --> 00:42:35,700
Rym: in the situation where you draw a card, you can't play right away.

848
00:42:36,081 --> 00:42:36,823
Rym: You want it.

849
00:42:37,405 --> 00:42:39,392
Rym: So you hold onto it in your hand.

850
00:42:39,874 --> 00:42:44,980
Rym: or you're in the situation where you have two cards in your hand and you want to play one, but you want to save one.

851
00:42:45,341 --> 00:42:51,460
Rym: And you're in a situation where like there are cool things you could do, but you're held back and you never feel like you really bust out with your whole hand.

852
00:42:51,721 --> 00:42:51,982
Scott: Yeah.

853
00:42:52,042 --> 00:42:57,217
Scott: This is like, you know, it's not so much on your turn about like deciding what to do with your hand.

854
00:42:57,237 --> 00:42:57,400
Scott: Right.

855
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:00,960
Scott: There's very rarely is it actually a difficult decision of what to do with your hand.

856
00:43:01,301 --> 00:43:06,563
Scott: You generally just lay out all your cards and you do the maximum you can do with those five cards.

857
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:10,200
Scott: And the real decision is what do you buy with the money that you have?

858
00:43:10,682 --> 00:43:16,719
Scott: And if you somehow, you know, in the rare occasion where you can't play all your action cards, which ones do you play?

859
00:43:17,203 --> 00:43:19,339
Scott: And then you throw everything out and draw five more cards.

860
00:43:20,021 --> 00:43:23,240
Scott: So, you know, there's a little bit less decision making going on there.

861
00:43:23,401 --> 00:43:28,522
Scott: But the decision of what to buy is ludicrously important, as you will figure out if you play the game.

862
00:43:28,864 --> 00:43:31,556
Scott: So the other thing about this game right is that you buy this.

863
00:43:31,636 --> 00:43:37,884
Scott: to the first of all, I want to say Dominion won this field this year, which is like guaranteed awesome game.

864
00:43:38,167 --> 00:43:39,178
Rym: So just buy it.

865
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:39,922
Scott: All right.

866
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:48,720
Scott: So currently there are two sets, Dominion and Dominion Intrigue, and they're both full sets, which means you don't need the other set to play.

867
00:43:48,981 --> 00:43:49,142
Scott: Right.

868
00:43:49,162 --> 00:43:55,460
Scott: You can play just Dominion Intrigue or just Dominion, but you can also mix them together because it's the same game, just different cards.

869
00:43:55,621 --> 00:43:55,844
Scott: Right.

870
00:43:56,288 --> 00:43:57,319
Scott: Whatever you can mix them up.

871
00:43:57,763 --> 00:43:59,700
Scott: They're coming out with Dominion Seaside.

872
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,300
Scott: I think they're calling it Seaport.

873
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:01,821
Scott: I don't know.

874
00:44:02,364 --> 00:44:07,091
Rym: I have this feeling they're going to be like tons and tons of expansions forever for this game.

875
00:44:07,192 --> 00:44:07,879
Scott: Yeah, that's fine.

876
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:15,920
Scott: But with the Dominion Seaside, you're going to need to either have Dominion or Dominion Intrigue to play with the seaside one.

877
00:44:16,465 --> 00:44:17,478
Scott: But anyway, that's not out yet.

878
00:44:18,342 --> 00:44:21,560
Scott: The way it works is there's there's some cards that you use in every game.

879
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:28,039
Scott: You always use the money in the victory cards and you always use the curses, even though they might not come into play.

880
00:44:29,641 --> 00:44:34,040
Scott: But the rest of the cards, right, you pick 10 and that's what you play with.

881
00:44:34,381 --> 00:44:34,642
Scott: Right.

882
00:44:35,545 --> 00:44:41,640
Scott: There's a lot more than 10 types of cards in the Dominion box, so every time you play the game is different.

883
00:44:42,061 --> 00:44:45,239
Scott: You know, you're picking 10 different cards to play with every time.

884
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:54,000
Scott: Imagine if like you decide to play Magic the Gathering and, you know, you pick 10 magic cards, you know, say, I don't know, 10 different creatures.

885
00:44:54,723 --> 00:44:56,399
Scott: And that was all you played with that whole game.

886
00:44:56,662 --> 00:44:57,408
Scott: And, you know, that was it.

887
00:44:57,468 --> 00:44:58,779
Scott: No other cards came into it.

888
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:00,025
Scott: That's what it's like.

889
00:45:00,066 --> 00:45:04,900
Scott: And every time you play Dominion, you pick 10 different ones and you mix together the intrigue and the Dominion.

890
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:09,040
Scott: There are so many different possible 10 card combinations.

891
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:19,284
Rym: Someone calculated on BoardGameGeek, it is impossible for any human in their entire life to spend the entire life playing multiple simultaneous games of Dominion to play every possible combination.

892
00:45:19,365 --> 00:45:20,892
Scott: And they're coming out with more cards.

893
00:45:21,273 --> 00:45:25,360
Scott: that exponentially increases the possible combinations that you could play.

894
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,360
Rym: Now, the cool thing is the replay value is insane.

895
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:32,382
Rym: It's also since it's simple, you know, these 10 cards, you lay them out from the from the boxes.

896
00:45:33,125 --> 00:45:36,220
Rym: If you find a really good set, it's kind of like a free sale.

897
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:39,320
Rym: You can say like, oh, play with these 10 and get all your friends to play the same set.

898
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:46,820
Scott: Again, in the instruction book, it says, you know, if it's your first time playing, play with these 10 cards, you know, and it's actually a pretty good suggestion.

899
00:45:46,982 --> 00:45:48,539
Scott: And they also have like themed sets.

900
00:45:48,961 --> 00:45:54,122
Rym: A lot of people are naming their sets like the Demustulator or the Demolisher or the Destructor.

901
00:45:54,223 --> 00:45:55,610
Scott: Yeah, it's like play with these like.

902
00:45:55,912 --> 00:45:59,900
Scott: and the thing is, depending on which 10 cards you get, the game can be drastically different.

903
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,868
Scott: For example, we played a game at PAX where there are all sorts of nasty curse cards like the witch.

904
00:46:05,113 --> 00:46:05,500
Rym: Oh, my God.

905
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:12,440
Rym: The witch basically proves to anyone in the world that everyone in the world is an asshole and given half a chance would destroy the world.

906
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:13,021
Scott: Right.

907
00:46:13,142 --> 00:46:18,805
Scott: So what happened in that game is everyone had really, really low scores and tons of curses.

908
00:46:19,128 --> 00:46:20,780
Scott: My final score was negative one.

909
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:24,360
Rym: And the game took forever and everyone rushed the witch, of course.

910
00:46:24,922 --> 00:46:26,857
Rym: We ran out of curses right away.

911
00:46:27,521 --> 00:46:27,963
Scott: The game.

912
00:46:28,003 --> 00:46:28,265
Scott: Right.

913
00:46:28,566 --> 00:46:34,480
Scott: But another game we played, like we played a game with the beginner set and basically everyone got a ton of points and a ton of cards.

914
00:46:34,521 --> 00:46:35,819
Scott: And the game was relatively quick.

915
00:46:36,401 --> 00:46:38,740
Scott: And, you know, the game was completely different with 10 different cards.

916
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,739
Scott: We just played a game just now before the show.

917
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:41,681
Scott: Right.

918
00:46:42,143 --> 00:46:45,112
Scott: Where basically, you know, it was?

919
00:46:45,413 --> 00:46:48,263
Scott: there weren't any cards out that were worth five dollars.

920
00:46:48,605 --> 00:46:51,260
Scott: There were only cards that most of the cards are worth four dollars.

921
00:46:51,361 --> 00:46:55,200
Scott: And the only things that were worth six dollars were the gold and the adventure.

922
00:46:56,561 --> 00:47:01,583
Scott: So it was like I kept getting five dollars and then we bought all the duchies, which are five dollars.

923
00:47:01,603 --> 00:47:06,820
Scott: And basically, you know, the game just dragged out and out and out and out.

924
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:10,960
Scott: And I wasn't able to keep up and I didn't get enough victory point.

925
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:12,700
Rym: Well, one problem I've noticed the game is good.

926
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,900
Rym: It's not great in that it's no Puerto Rico.

927
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:18,199
Scott: No, it's not a Puerto Rico or a teeny.

928
00:47:18,481 --> 00:47:19,606
Scott: Not at all.

929
00:47:19,626 --> 00:47:26,481
Rym: A lot of people on BoardGameGeek are talking about all these really like intense strategies and people like arguing about the different strategies for different loadouts.

930
00:47:27,705 --> 00:47:36,894
Rym: I've found that pretty much there's only one real strategy and you only deviate from this if you very specifically must build a machine.

931
00:47:37,416 --> 00:47:48,779
Rym: probabilistic probabilistically that will generate money, eight dollars a round to buy provinces, buy provinces to run out the deck, only deviate if someone else is going to buy more provinces than you.

932
00:47:49,223 --> 00:47:49,465
Scott: Yep.

933
00:47:50,193 --> 00:47:50,780
Rym: That's the whole game.

934
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:51,570
Rym: That's all strategy.

935
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:52,320
Rym: And it works perfectly.

936
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:55,080
Rym: And I've never found any evidence that anything else is a good idea.

937
00:47:55,720 --> 00:48:06,260
Scott: I think there might be a better idea if, you know, somehow there you find some way to generate like more points, you know, and maybe in a future set.

938
00:48:06,361 --> 00:48:06,643
Scott: Right.

939
00:48:07,065 --> 00:48:09,180
Scott: There will be better cards than the province.

940
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,680
Rym: Well, no, it depends more on what sets are out there.

941
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:17,699
Rym: Like the real decisions you're making are when do you buy militia versus some other attack card, even bother with attack cards?

942
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:18,042
Rym: Yeah.

943
00:48:18,283 --> 00:48:21,971
Rym: Like do you bother with militia in a many player game when other people might be militiaing everyone?

944
00:48:21,991 --> 00:48:22,539
Rym: What do you care?

945
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:24,270
Scott: Yep.

946
00:48:24,472 --> 00:48:25,280
Scott: It's that kind of thing.

947
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,163
Rym: It's a good game, though.

948
00:48:26,183 --> 00:48:30,402
Rym: I mean, it's the thing is, don't think it's kind of like Agricola.

949
00:48:30,724 --> 00:48:34,120
Rym: The game of Agricola is not optimizing your farm.

950
00:48:34,201 --> 00:48:35,840
Rym: That's the obvious trivial problem.

951
00:48:36,201 --> 00:48:40,530
Rym: Anyone with half a brain, like if you're good at the game, your farm is perfectly optimal.

952
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:41,180
Rym: A hundred percent.

953
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,400
Rym: You know exactly what to do in Dominion.

954
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:47,708
Rym: If you even have half a brain and you're good at board games, you'll know exactly what to do with every hand.

955
00:48:47,728 --> 00:48:48,619
Rym: You won't even think about it.

956
00:48:49,121 --> 00:48:57,300
Rym: The whole game is figuring out what to do with all the ancillary actions on your way to the provinces to prevent other people from getting the provinces.

957
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:03,339
Rym: Just like in Agricola, all you're really trying to do is prevent other people from getting the resources they need to get more people in their family.

958
00:49:04,967 --> 00:49:05,028
Scott: Yep.

959
00:49:05,048 --> 00:49:06,478
Scott: But yeah, the other the what's really great...

960
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:07,428
Rym: Obvious players won't see that.

961
00:49:07,448 --> 00:49:08,419
Rym: So if you see that, you'll beat them.

962
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:09,766
Rym: There's a lot of.

963
00:49:09,786 --> 00:49:11,260
Scott: I could give a lot of Dominion strategies.

964
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:12,003
Scott: Maybe we will.

965
00:49:12,063 --> 00:49:19,340
Scott: But the thing that's really great about Dominion is, OK, it's not as great as a T&E or a Puerto Rico, you know, from a from a game perspective.

966
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:20,680
Scott: You know, it's not some masterpiece.

967
00:49:20,821 --> 00:49:21,585
Scott: It's just really great.

968
00:49:22,953 --> 00:49:24,180
Scott: So why play it?

969
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:27,000
Scott: Well, the reason is, number one, it's really fast.

970
00:49:27,242 --> 00:49:28,700
Scott: You can just whip it out and play it.

971
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,020
Scott: And the setup is pretty easy.

972
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:37,520
Scott: And if you've set it up already, you can play a whole bunch of games, you know, very quickly, you know, because you won't have to reset up a lot of the games.

973
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,459
Scott: You just pick 10 new cards and you're good to go.

974
00:49:40,022 --> 00:49:41,659
Scott: And it's just shuffle, draw, go.

975
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:42,659
Scott: It's so quick.

976
00:49:43,022 --> 00:49:46,160
Scott: You know, other games like have a lot of set up, lots of pieces, lots.

977
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:46,361
Scott: Right.

978
00:49:46,401 --> 00:49:47,247
Scott: It's just cards.

979
00:49:47,529 --> 00:49:48,960
Scott: They're well organized in the box.

980
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,079
Scott: You can just whip them out and play.

981
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:57,140
Rym: Actually, the cool thing about it is that especially if you're playing with, you know, a bunch of really skilled gamers, one, I'd recommend learning how to shuffle cards.

982
00:49:57,643 --> 00:49:58,391
Rym: And you might laugh.

983
00:49:58,512 --> 00:49:59,159
Rym: It's not easy.

984
00:50:00,282 --> 00:50:04,479
Scott: As many people who played with us, like I didn't even think about it because I've been shuffling cards since I was young.

985
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:11,180
Scott: But there is like multiple people that we've played with, you know, because I know I don't want any of them to feel bad because we played with a lot of people.

986
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,780
Scott: They just can't shuffle cards, which is understandable.

987
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:15,620
Rym: It's not an easy skill and you have to learn it.

988
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:16,204
Rym: It's not intuitive.

989
00:50:16,284 --> 00:50:21,560
Scott: I only know it because I, you know, it's like I sort of take it for granted, but I only can do it really well because I've been doing it since I was three.

990
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:28,680
Scott: Most people go to like, you know, card dealing school to become like casino dealers, you know, to learn it later in life if they don't know it.

991
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:29,042
Scott: All right.

992
00:50:29,062 --> 00:50:29,203
Scott: Yeah.

993
00:50:29,344 --> 00:50:44,760
Rym: But that aside, like if you've got a bunch of people who are like dexterous with their hands and with cards, they're used to playing card games, you like there's such a visceral and active feeling playing the game because you like you draw five cards, you throw them all down, you do all this stuff, you grab them all, you discard everything, you throw it back out.

994
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:46,900
Scott: Like I can literally take my turn in like two seconds.

995
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:54,221
Scott: If four Scott Rubins are playing Dominion, it'd be like, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, you know, like doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, insane.

996
00:50:54,261 --> 00:51:00,260
Rym: But it makes this vibe where you're all like every round, you're constantly picking up cards, throwing cards down, tossing cards around.

997
00:51:00,321 --> 00:51:01,980
Rym: It it's a really lively game.

998
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:07,786
Rym: But yet as a result, it's a very like social game, much more so than many other games we play.

999
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:10,640
Rym: I'm not socializing when we're playing T&E on my turn.

1000
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:16,520
Scott: I'm going, huh, it's also a game that works really well with two, three, four players.

1001
00:51:16,701 --> 00:51:21,639
Scott: And if you have two sets, you know, if you have Dominion and Dominion Intrigue, I think you can play with five or six players.

1002
00:51:22,242 --> 00:51:24,460
Rym: I want to make the Dominion Tank Police expansion.

1003
00:51:24,802 --> 00:51:26,440
Scott: I know that's the joke that we always make.

1004
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:27,280
Scott: Let's play Tank Police.

1005
00:51:27,722 --> 00:51:29,600
Rym: All right, please.

1006
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:31,205
Scott: Now, the one thing is the.

1007
00:51:31,325 --> 00:51:35,980
Scott: I think the cards that are in the regular Dominion set are just a lot better than the ones in the Intrigue set.

1008
00:51:36,161 --> 00:51:36,563
Rym: I agree.

1009
00:51:36,623 --> 00:51:40,480
Scott: The Intrigue set is more sort of like these slightly weird cards.

1010
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:41,578
Scott: They're a lot more dickish.

1011
00:51:42,101 --> 00:51:47,260
Scott: You know, they do a lot more funky, weird stuff and a lot less of the simple and straightforward stuff.

1012
00:51:47,801 --> 00:51:55,880
Scott: And, you know, that stuff can be cool, but it's like too much of it is just sort of makes the game a little finicky and flaky, you know, but, you know, Intrigue is still good.

1013
00:51:56,223 --> 00:51:57,400
Scott: It's good to have more Dominion.

1014
00:51:57,580 --> 00:52:04,740
Scott: If you just had the only, you know, just the Dominion set, it eventually would get kind of stale and use the Intrigue set to spice it up.

1015
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:07,619
Scott: But I think that's why I'm going to get the Seaside set to spice it up even more.

1016
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:17,787
Scott: The thing is, if you haven't played it at all yet, I would recommend just getting the plain old Dominion and starting with that and don't get the Intrigue set to your board with the regular one.

1017
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:19,930
Rym: But just make, you know, actually learn the game.

1018
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:23,510
Rym: Don't just read the rules and go, actually, you know, play it if possible.

1019
00:52:23,590 --> 00:52:24,890
Rym: Get someone to teach you how to play it.

1020
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:25,969
Rym: Who knows how to play already?

1021
00:52:26,231 --> 00:52:27,710
Rym: Yeah, that'll make it go so much faster.

1022
00:52:28,090 --> 00:52:28,171
Scott: Yeah.

1023
00:52:28,475 --> 00:52:29,590
Rym: There are some minor gripes, though.

1024
00:52:30,232 --> 00:52:32,490
Rym: One copper, silver and gold are all the same color.

1025
00:52:32,953 --> 00:52:33,767
Scott: Yeah, that's annoying.

1026
00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:35,450
Rym: That bothers a lot of people.

1027
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:37,510
Scott: Another thing that bothers me is you look at like a copper.

1028
00:52:37,791 --> 00:52:38,053
Scott: Right.

1029
00:52:38,133 --> 00:52:38,577
Scott: And it has.

1030
00:52:38,617 --> 00:52:40,530
Scott: the number of copper is worth one dollar.

1031
00:52:40,631 --> 00:52:40,772
Scott: Right.

1032
00:52:40,792 --> 00:52:43,130
Scott: But it costs zero dollars at the top.

1033
00:52:43,291 --> 00:52:47,490
Scott: It has two ones in the corners and a big one in the middle and a zero in the bottom left.

1034
00:52:47,671 --> 00:52:54,609
Scott: And it's sort of like, you know, you could have made it look a little different, maybe, you know, so I keep looking at my go.

1035
00:52:54,830 --> 00:52:55,790
Scott: This costs one other way.

1036
00:52:55,830 --> 00:52:56,197
Scott: No, it doesn't.

1037
00:52:56,218 --> 00:52:56,789
Scott: It costs zero.

1038
00:52:57,390 --> 00:53:05,370
Scott: You know, some of the other problems I have is basically the seven dollar problem, which pretty sure is intentional.

1039
00:53:06,090 --> 00:53:08,850
Scott: Basically, nothing is worth seven dollars in the game.

1040
00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:12,651
Rym: Well, the way to get around that is to get a buy action and then buy like a five and a two.

1041
00:53:13,402 --> 00:53:13,869
Scott: That's true.

1042
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:16,310
Scott: But sometimes there is no way to get a buy.

1043
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:18,710
Scott: I mean, the game we just played, there were no extra buys whatsoever.

1044
00:53:18,850 --> 00:53:20,770
Rym: Well, it depends on what kind of game you're playing.

1045
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:28,213
Rym: I mean, every combination is different and you have to every different combination will have these ruts where like that amount of money is a suboptimal amount of money to have in your hand.

1046
00:53:28,394 --> 00:53:37,030
Scott: I know it's like, you know, if everything on the table is either four dollars, six dollars or eight dollars and you draw five dollars, it's like, ah, I wasted a whole dollar.

1047
00:53:37,152 --> 00:53:38,428
Scott: You know, there's nothing I can do with it.

1048
00:53:39,031 --> 00:53:40,077
Scott: I drew seven dollars.

1049
00:53:40,137 --> 00:53:42,450
Scott: Fuck, if I only had one more, he'd get the eight dollar card.

1050
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:42,973
Scott: Much better.

1051
00:53:43,517 --> 00:53:45,130
Scott: It's like eternally frustrating.

1052
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:49,210
Scott: You just keep drawing seven dollars every turn and all you want is eight dollars.

1053
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:50,093
Scott: You can get the province.

1054
00:53:50,535 --> 00:53:59,728
Rym: One problem with the game is that having it in the boxes kind of sucks, but there aren't really a lot of good ways to handle this game because you need to keep all the sets separate and easy to get to.

1055
00:54:00,252 --> 00:54:06,910
Scott: I think what I'm going to do is I'm going to get, you know, the long boxes that like baseball card guys put cards in the kind of have under my bed from when I was a kid.

1056
00:54:07,671 --> 00:54:10,827
Scott: And I'm just going to put little pieces of paper between those pieces of paper.

1057
00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:13,807
Rym: Use actual cardboard dividers with the tab at the top.

1058
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:15,035
Scott: We can use whatever.

1059
00:54:15,116 --> 00:54:18,214
Scott: But, you know, the point is just I'll just put them all in the box in one row.

1060
00:54:18,234 --> 00:54:21,309
Scott: So it takes up a lot less space than the gigantic Dominion box.

1061
00:54:21,852 --> 00:54:24,429
Scott: But then I'll put little dividers in of some kind.

1062
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:34,930
Rym: What I really don't get, though, is a lot of people are buying sleeves for every one of these individual cards because they're worried about the game like wearing out seriously for the pain in the ass.

1063
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:35,432
Rym: That is.

1064
00:54:35,492 --> 00:54:38,569
Rym: And the cost just by the game again, like five years from now.

1065
00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:39,173
Scott: Yeah, I know.

1066
00:54:39,213 --> 00:54:39,334
Scott: Right.

1067
00:54:39,354 --> 00:54:41,893
Scott: The other thing is that, you know, what does that really protect you from?

1068
00:54:41,933 --> 00:54:44,150
Scott: It protects you from maybe a spill.

1069
00:54:44,511 --> 00:54:44,713
Scott: Right.

1070
00:54:44,773 --> 00:54:47,170
Scott: If someone spills something, here's the here's one worry.

1071
00:54:47,430 --> 00:54:48,095
Rym: The thing is, right.

1072
00:54:48,115 --> 00:54:50,090
Scott: No one spilled anything over any board games.

1073
00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:50,490
Rym: No.

1074
00:54:50,531 --> 00:54:56,110
Rym: The worry is that, all right, as more expansions come out, the expansion cards will be obviously expansion cards.

1075
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:58,830
Rym: They'll be less worn, less tattered, less frayed.

1076
00:54:58,850 --> 00:55:00,728
Rym: They'll be newer looking in the deck.

1077
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:02,337
Scott: That's possible.

1078
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:03,369
Rym: That's going to happen.

1079
00:55:03,491 --> 00:55:04,810
Rym: But I don't feel like it's worth it.

1080
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:09,961
Rym: I mean, my magic cards, you could tell my beta cards from my unlimited cards, from my revised cards.

1081
00:55:10,123 --> 00:55:10,590
Rym: That's true.

1082
00:55:10,810 --> 00:55:11,769
Rym: And we just dealt with it.

1083
00:55:12,490 --> 00:55:12,992
Rym: People did.

1084
00:55:13,414 --> 00:55:17,733
Rym: People didn't spend that much effort trying to figure out what was coming up in people's decks.

1085
00:55:18,155 --> 00:55:20,768
Rym: I would, but I don't think anyone else will know.

1086
00:55:21,251 --> 00:55:23,690
Rym: I mean, seriously, sleeves are a pain in the ass.

1087
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:24,603
Rym: How are you going to shuffle?

1088
00:55:24,847 --> 00:55:25,010
Scott: Yeah.

1089
00:55:25,110 --> 00:55:28,593
Scott: Shuffling is a huge pain in the ass when your cards are covered with like a piece of plastic.

1090
00:55:28,633 --> 00:55:30,910
Scott: It's also it's a lot harder to store the cards.

1091
00:55:31,050 --> 00:55:32,608
Scott: You can't store them in the regular Old Dominion box.

1092
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:37,749
Rym: There's a whole thread on BoardGameGeek where they pointed out that if you sleeve them, they will not fit back in the box.

1093
00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:38,250
Scott: Right.

1094
00:55:38,271 --> 00:55:42,730
Scott: So it's like you got to find a kind of box that can hold sleeved cards, you know.

1095
00:55:43,070 --> 00:55:49,770
Scott: And the thing is, sleeves were designed for games like Magic the Gathering and they cut remember like the Penny Arcade game came with those little plastic boxes.

1096
00:55:50,431 --> 00:55:57,050
Scott: That's the kind of little, you know, it's a box designed to hold like one deck of like 60 cards, you know, for a game of magic.

1097
00:55:57,352 --> 00:56:00,150
Scott: That's the kind of box you can get that will hold sleeved cards.

1098
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:04,590
Scott: Good luck finding a box that will hold, you know, a thousand sleeve Dominion cards.

1099
00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:12,410
Rym: One thing I'm amazed about, a lot of people are pointing out how they periodically replace the sleeves on their cardi games because they get so greasy and sticky.

1100
00:56:13,574 --> 00:56:15,090
Rym: What kind of gamers are they?

1101
00:56:15,370 --> 00:56:19,129
Scott: Like, wash your hands, wash your hands.

1102
00:56:19,330 --> 00:56:22,230
Rym: I mean, Jesus Christ, there's no grease on our Puerto Rico side.

1103
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:22,892
Scott: Yeah, I know.

1104
00:56:22,953 --> 00:56:25,990
Scott: It's like, do I put plastic sleeves over like any other board game?

1105
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:28,550
Scott: I mean, dude, it's got a curricula, has a bunch of cards in it.

1106
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:29,755
Scott: You don't see us leaving.

1107
00:56:29,796 --> 00:56:34,029
Rym: those people are suggesting the same sleeves that they're all using for their curricula sets.

1108
00:56:35,872 --> 00:56:36,462
Scott: Yeah.

1109
00:56:36,624 --> 00:56:36,889
Scott: Wow.

1110
00:56:37,291 --> 00:56:38,236
Rym: We need to take a picture.

1111
00:56:38,257 --> 00:56:40,712
Rym: We got to put sleeves on all those little brown men in Puerto Rico.

1112
00:56:40,732 --> 00:56:42,569
Rym: I mean, it's like I take a picture of that.

1113
00:56:43,093 --> 00:56:43,194
Scott: Yeah.

1114
00:56:43,214 --> 00:56:44,910
Scott: It's like I put sleeves on my comic books.

1115
00:56:45,211 --> 00:56:45,432
Scott: Right.

1116
00:56:45,532 --> 00:56:55,235
Scott: But that's not because, you know, I'm like afraid of like anyone damaging them with a spill or something is because have you seen a comic book, you know, from like 30 years ago?

1117
00:56:55,459 --> 00:56:56,210
Scott: It's like unreadable.

1118
00:56:56,430 --> 00:56:57,969
Scott: It turns yellow and it turns into dust.

1119
00:56:58,851 --> 00:57:03,291
Scott: So and the thing is, if I'm not going to read a comic book ever again, I just get rid of it.

1120
00:57:03,752 --> 00:57:08,291
Scott: And if I'm going to keep it, it's because I want to read it like for the rest of my life.

1121
00:57:08,352 --> 00:57:12,210
Scott: Maybe I don't really expect my dominion set to last the rest of my life.

1122
00:57:12,693 --> 00:57:14,350
Scott: You know, it's not really necessary.

1123
00:57:15,293 --> 00:57:17,050
Scott: You know, it's like it'll still be playable.

1124
00:57:17,270 --> 00:57:20,990
Scott: I mean, my magic cards are already from middle school and they're still just fine.

1125
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:22,350
Scott: They're the same exact as they were.

1126
00:57:22,370 --> 00:57:23,449
Scott: And they're not in any sleeves.

1127
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:24,810
Scott: Completely unnecessary.

1128
00:57:25,030 --> 00:57:27,790
Rym: Well, no, my magic cards are all definitely worn out.

1129
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:31,050
Rym: The ones that I used a lot and they obviously stand out as being worn out.

1130
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:31,534
Scott: They're not greasy.

1131
00:57:31,554 --> 00:57:33,290
Scott: They're slightly worn, but they're not.

1132
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:35,630
Rym: No, they're worn enough to where it's obvious what set they're from.

1133
00:57:35,872 --> 00:57:37,050
Rym: Like it is kind of a problem.

1134
00:57:37,832 --> 00:57:38,598
Scott: I don't notice that.

1135
00:57:38,638 --> 00:57:40,190
Rym: In fact, I had a couple of tournaments.

1136
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:46,110
Rym: I was I had to replace cards because they were worn enough to where the person I was playing against complained.

1137
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:50,229
Rym: And as a result, I had to remove those cards from my deck or use proxy cards.

1138
00:57:50,432 --> 00:57:50,858
Scott: Ah, yes.

1139
00:57:52,030 --> 00:57:52,272
Rym: Yeah.

1140
00:57:52,815 --> 00:57:55,330
Rym: Anyway, of course, I also used to cheat.

1141
00:57:56,092 --> 00:58:01,929
Rym: I would lick I put them in sleeves, but I'd lick the sleeves of cards that comboed well together so they'd stick when I shuffled because you can't shuffle sleeves.

1142
00:58:02,331 --> 00:58:12,495
Scott: Yeah, that's another thing is that I think it's sleeves actually can enable some forms of cheating because you can like put things in the sleeves besides the cards, you know, and what like?

1143
00:58:12,961 --> 00:58:13,590
Rym: we're playing divinity.

1144
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:15,549
Rym: I'm like Blackjack, Yahtzee.

1145
00:58:16,151 --> 00:58:16,855
Rym: What am I going to do?

1146
00:58:16,895 --> 00:58:20,290
Scott: You could put like a secret message and then, you know, pass it or something like that.

1147
00:58:20,371 --> 00:58:20,533
Rym: What?

1148
00:58:20,554 --> 00:58:21,609
Rym: How's that going to help me?

1149
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:22,416
Rym: It's not Euchre.

1150
00:58:22,678 --> 00:58:24,090
Scott: I didn't mean in dominion specifically.

1151
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:25,100
Scott: I meant in general.

1152
00:58:25,161 --> 00:58:25,810
Rym: What in magic?

1153
00:58:26,190 --> 00:58:28,689
Rym: I tell my opponent I'm going to beat you now.

1154
00:58:31,692 --> 00:58:33,489
Scott: Maybe in multiplayer magic.

1155
00:58:33,870 --> 00:58:35,890
Rym: But in multiplayer magic, the goals are obvious.

1156
00:58:36,530 --> 00:58:38,970
Rym: You just want to beat the two, you know, opposite colored people across from you.

1157
00:58:39,611 --> 00:58:41,930
Scott: The point is, is that I don't like sleeves.

1158
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:44,150
Rym: I don't like sleeves either, but not for that reason.

1159
00:58:44,571 --> 00:58:45,235
Rym: It's an OK reason.

1160
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:47,429
Rym: There are better ways to cheat than secret messages.

1161
00:58:48,075 --> 00:58:49,950
Scott: Secret messages are the ultimate cheating method.

1162
00:58:50,310 --> 00:58:50,876
Rym: Dominion's great.

1163
00:58:51,017 --> 00:58:52,290
Rym: Seriously, if you're a gamer at all.

1164
00:58:52,430 --> 00:58:56,253
Scott: And also, if you're not, it's also the new hotness, get it while it's still hot and people are playing it.

1165
00:58:56,333 --> 00:59:07,890
Rym: If you're not super into board games, I'd recommend Dominion as not necessarily a starter game, but a one of the early games you buy after you get into definitely like, you know, it's like you get your settlers and your carcass.

1166
00:59:08,030 --> 00:59:10,069
Scott: So like Dominion is next on the list after that.

1167
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:15,790
Rym: It's also a great game if you're into games to get non gamers in because you can teach them how to play pretty quickly.

1168
00:59:15,911 --> 00:59:20,034
Rym: And the game is so quick that you're not going to have people balking about sitting there for four hours.

1169
00:59:20,255 --> 00:59:28,013
Scott: It's also great, you know, if you've got like a Magic the Gathering card, Pokemon card game type of person and you want to bring them over to the German board games.

1170
00:59:28,033 --> 00:59:33,089
Scott: like this is the transfer game, you know, haven't played Dominion, then the settlers, if they're that kind of person.

1171
00:59:34,450 --> 00:59:38,649
Rym: All right, I think that's about it and I want to go to bed, so let's go to bed.

1172
00:59:45,261 --> 00:59:47,340
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1173
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,960
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music.

1176
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:10,219
Rym: Mondays are science and technology.

1177

Rym: Tuesdays we have video games, board games and RPGs.

1178

Rym: Wednesdays are anime, manga, comic nights and Thursdays are the catch alls for various rants and tomfoolery.

1186
