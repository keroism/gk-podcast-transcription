1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,726
Rym: It's Tuesday January 13th.

2
00:00:11,966 --> 00:00:12,388
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,548 --> 00:00:15,035
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:15,055 --> 00:00:25,901
Rym: We talk a bit about fallout 3.

5
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:26,917
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,961 --> 00:00:39,917
Rym: So uh over the xmas holiday one of the things I did is I bought gifts for some people and I got Emily a copy of chrono trigger on the DS.

7
00:00:41,261 --> 00:00:44,331
Rym: It's weird how I didn't really have any desire to play that game again.

8
00:00:44,372 --> 00:00:46,419
Rym: I mean I played that game like 40 times.

9
00:00:47,621 --> 00:00:52,757
Scott: I didn't play it 40 times more like four times and mostly the only.

10
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:55,792
Rym: I'll put it this way I play even though I knew there were zillion endings.

11
00:00:55,852 --> 00:00:59,872
Scott: the only one of the only reasons I was actually able to play it again was because of plus mode.

12
00:01:00,013 --> 00:01:00,495
Scott: yeah plus.

13
00:01:00,535 --> 00:01:01,520
Rym: well what I was about to say?

14
00:01:01,622 --> 00:01:12,430
Rym: I played through the whole game Maybe three or four times in my life one time when I was living alone and I had nothing to do and I had an emulator, but I Played plus mode 36 times.

15
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:16,006
Rym: yeah plus mode because I would just go around like hey I'll go beat that boss.

16
00:01:16,067 --> 00:01:18,379
Rym: Just because it'll take me like five minutes to get there.

17
00:01:18,962 --> 00:01:19,785
Scott: Yeah, it's you know.

18
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:23,400
Scott: I think that they should just have the option of just starting the game plus mode.

19
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:28,500
Scott: That way you know you can get all the goodness without having you know the bet cuz chrono trigger.

20
00:01:29,021 --> 00:01:35,540
Scott: While it's probably what the best Japanese RPG game you have to beat the game as JRPG BS.

21
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,680
Rym: You have to beat the game at least once the real way or else plus mode is just stupid.

22
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,480
Scott: Yeah, cuz then you just go into the bucket right away and win a game over in plus mode like WTF mate.

23
00:01:44,701 --> 00:01:46,911
Scott: Yeah, if you play in real mode then you just.

24
00:01:46,971 --> 00:01:52,593
Rym: one thing I can say that I didn't expect was Watching because we have another friend Jess who hadn't really played this game before.

25
00:01:53,014 --> 00:01:59,600
Rym: so I'm watching the two of them Play this game, and I'm seeing it again from those kind of virgin eyes.

26
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:20,944
Rym: I mean I think back to the game, and I remember being good and awesome and enjoying it but Seeing someone else play it and starting to remember the sort of all the first like the first time I encountered certain things like I Think the iconic moment for me was when I got back from saving the girl in the past and I go to the courtroom thing and That guy walks out.

27
00:02:20,984 --> 00:02:21,646
Rym: that guy what?

28
00:02:21,706 --> 00:02:25,356
Rym: whose lunch I ate, and I remember thinking what the fuck.

29
00:02:25,838 --> 00:02:26,640
Rym: What's he doing here?

30
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,202
Rym: Oh shit.

31
00:02:27,302 --> 00:02:28,025
Rym: I can't believe it.

32
00:02:28,086 --> 00:02:29,472
Scott: damn it damn it damn it damn it.

33
00:02:29,552 --> 00:02:30,356
Scott: I can't believe eating.

34
00:02:30,396 --> 00:02:31,200
Scott: the lunch mattered.

35
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:35,640
Rym: Ah, I can't believe it or uh, but you're still hungry.

36
00:02:36,481 --> 00:02:37,164
Scott: You're still hungry.

37
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:38,509
Scott: How about that guy who raises you?

38
00:02:38,529 --> 00:02:40,597
Rym: Oh my god with the mode seven.

39
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:42,403
Scott: yep I love that.

40
00:02:42,945 --> 00:02:43,827
Scott: also gato.

41
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:45,712
Rym: He has metal joints.

42
00:02:45,752 --> 00:02:47,036
Scott: You put the gato song in.

43
00:02:47,337 --> 00:02:47,838
Rym: oh my god.

44
00:02:47,979 --> 00:02:48,440
Rym: I'll find it.

45
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,609
Rym: I got it even though apparently I was.

46
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:55,027
Rym: I was catching up on old fast karate and Apparently Dave downloaded the entire.

47
00:02:55,047 --> 00:02:58,699
Rym: I mean I downloaded the entire OC remix collection in like.

48
00:03:01,261 --> 00:03:04,071
Rym: So I haven't updated my OC remix collection since then.

49
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:10,379
Rym: apparently he downloaded the current collection And he's going through every song trying to find the good ones.

50
00:03:11,341 --> 00:03:15,298
Rym: Apparently the ratio of good to bad has only decreased over time, huh?

51
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,202
Rym: Duly noted.

52
00:03:17,222 --> 00:03:18,968
Rym: I'm giving up any plan.

53
00:03:18,988 --> 00:03:19,951
Rym: I'm open when he finishes.

54
00:03:19,971 --> 00:03:22,780
Rym: I can ask him for his complete perfect collection.

55
00:03:23,442 --> 00:03:24,687
Scott: Oh, it's not a bad idea.

56
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:25,570
Rym: That's what I got to do.

57
00:03:25,911 --> 00:03:27,637
Rym: so godspeed David Riley.

58
00:03:27,838 --> 00:03:30,658
Rym: Godspeed alrighty.

59
00:03:31,182 --> 00:03:31,786
Rym: That's all I got.

60
00:03:32,027 --> 00:03:34,540
Rym: you can play any games other than I've been playing NS.

61
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:38,176
Scott: I finished playing Fallout 3. no desire to play it anymore.

62
00:03:38,196 --> 00:03:42,048
Scott: Yeah, and I'm playing that alchemy flash game.

63
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:45,580
Rym: Oh my god that alchemy flash game was like a breath of fresh air.

64
00:03:45,881 --> 00:03:46,505
Scott: It's a good game.

65
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:54,134
Rym: It is even though it builds upon trends We've been seeing in gaming anyway, but it executes it better than many of those games have.

66
00:03:54,455 --> 00:03:56,280
Scott: it's a good game for learning the programming.

67
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:03,736
Rym: Let me tell you yeah god if I was teaching like elementary or middle school kids about computers I would totally make them play this game in class.

68
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:04,299
Scott: mm-hmm.

69
00:04:04,821 --> 00:04:13,528
Scott: Well really it's not gonna teach you a lot about some aspects of computing, but it will help you with things like You know Pipelining and stuff like that.

70
00:04:13,548 --> 00:04:15,514
Rym: It'll teach you about the logics.

71
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:16,478
Scott: Yeah, it's it.

72
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:23,545
Scott: I mean It's hard to think about it sort of as functions even though they're there, but yeah It doesn't.

73
00:04:23,645 --> 00:04:23,826
Scott: you know.

74
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:27,440
Scott: it's like there are functions here, but it's hard to see them unless you know.

75
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:33,178
Rym: But ideas like race conditions are very apparent to even someone who's never heard of a race condition before.

76
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:34,322
Scott: oh indeed They won't.

77
00:04:34,342 --> 00:04:36,594
Scott: they won't know to call it a race condition, but they will know.

78
00:04:36,614 --> 00:04:37,740
Rym: but they'll know what that thing is.

79
00:04:37,841 --> 00:04:44,148
Scott: I know throw in some weights Actually would probably help you with some quake scripting to play this game.

80
00:04:44,991 --> 00:04:45,573
Rym: Oh my god.

81
00:04:46,275 --> 00:04:47,760
Rym: I'm done with quake scripting.

82
00:04:47,881 --> 00:04:49,893
Rym: I remember I wrote a function.

83
00:04:49,913 --> 00:04:51,140
Scott: wait wait wait wait wait wait wait.

84
00:04:51,401 --> 00:04:55,897
Rym: I wrote a function in quake that was just a loop of 20 weights.

85
00:04:57,701 --> 00:05:05,540
Scott: Well a lot of people do right is the fastest way to do it is you do You just type five weights real quick like we're right and then you call that weight five.

86
00:05:06,203 --> 00:05:09,456
Scott: And then you do like five weight fives and now you have 25 weight.

87
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,620
Rym: yep I had all different.

88
00:05:12,262 --> 00:05:14,952
Scott: And then you could do 425 weights to get a hundred weight.

89
00:05:15,113 --> 00:05:17,000
Rym: you realize I had two different keys.

90
00:05:17,622 --> 00:05:29,400
Rym: One was bound to my low ping bastard offhand grenade script because it gave you offhand grenades and quick to a game Which famously did not have offhand grenades, but what game nowadays has offhand grenades?

91
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,634
Rym: Nothing that's right, but back then it was famous.

92
00:05:33,694 --> 00:05:34,558
Rym: It was a big deal.

93
00:05:34,618 --> 00:05:37,120
Scott: I remember I think actually halo has offhand grenades.

94
00:05:37,301 --> 00:05:49,397
Rym: I remember like the first thing I heard about quake - like when my friends were all buzzing about it because we were all in the Clan communities back then and it was like oh my god quake - has a date and oh my god.

95
00:05:49,457 --> 00:05:50,460
Rym: No offhand grenades.

96
00:05:52,741 --> 00:05:57,908
Rym: But so I had the script that would give you offhand grenades And I had the low ping version.

97
00:05:57,988 --> 00:06:01,200
Scott: and the high ping version is basically switch weapon throw grenade switch weapon.

98
00:06:01,501 --> 00:06:08,020
Rym: Yes, because I there was a previous weapon Command and so I would use that to get back to whatever weapon I was using before.

99
00:06:08,642 --> 00:06:12,900
Rym: It was pretty elegant for someone in high school who had never really written anything other than Q basic.

100
00:06:13,061 --> 00:06:15,426
Scott: Yeah And you know that's a huge advantage.

101
00:06:15,486 --> 00:06:25,399
Rym: being able to push a button to throw a grenade while still using your other weapon Bonus points for giving it to an entire clan does making them dominate for a short while before other people also get it.

102
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,927
Rym: But anyway, you got any.

103
00:06:27,088 --> 00:06:27,409
Rym: I don't know.

104
00:06:27,469 --> 00:06:28,434
Rym: video game news.

105
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:30,946
Scott: Oh Video game news.

106
00:06:30,986 --> 00:06:31,730
Scott: what's going on?

107
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:32,855
Scott: Apparently, I don't know.

108
00:06:32,895 --> 00:06:33,919
Scott: Sony's losing money.

109
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,479
Scott: Nintendo's making money even though I don't know what games that are coming out with.

110
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:38,583
Rym: well You know what?

111
00:06:38,603 --> 00:06:42,575
Rym: They're making money off of Wii Sports sold more than Mario Brothers.

112
00:06:42,756 --> 00:06:45,304
Rym: Well Super Mario Brothers Actually, there's a.

113
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:50,140
Scott: there's an EA game coming out for the DS called like Henry has worth or something like that.

114
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,706
Scott: It's a little puzzle II platform run gonna.

115
00:06:51,827 --> 00:06:53,373
Scott: I'm gonna take a look at that when it comes out.

116
00:06:54,237 --> 00:06:59,860
Scott: in the meantime This is a clothing store on the corner from my work the Uniqlo or whatever.

117
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:07,180
Scott: It's basically Japanese Old Navy, but you know it in you know, it's like there's probably like one Old Navy in Japan.

118
00:07:07,341 --> 00:07:11,075
Scott: So there's one Uniqlo and I don't know there might be more than one Uniqlo in the u.s.

119
00:07:11,115 --> 00:07:12,220
Scott: But there's one in New York City.

120
00:07:12,563 --> 00:07:20,360
Scott: It's probably not one near your house And they tend to have you know nerdy clothes because even though it's Japanese Old Navy, right?

121
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:26,237
Scott: I mean if you walk into Old Navy or I guess like Kohl's or whatever in the u.s You'll see clothes that have like u.s.

122
00:07:27,101 --> 00:07:33,079
Scott: You know properties licensed properties on them like you can go get like Superman underwear for your kid or whatever, right?

123
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,860
Scott: So of course and yes for your kid in quotes, right?

124
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:47,133
Scott: so and you know a Japanese Old Navy you're gonna see like they had all sorts of like Tezuka style and shirts and Gogo 13 shirts, you know, and this is sort of for us.

125
00:07:47,193 --> 00:07:53,133
Scott: It's like all man's hot merchandise Japanese licensed properties on them, but for them is class for them.

126
00:07:53,233 --> 00:07:59,199
Scott: It's like oh, there's some licensed property shirts Just like the way you would look at like like a spongebob shirt at Kohl's.

127
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:05,220
Rym: But nothing's classier than wearing some good jeans a nice gray blazer and a Duke Togo face right underneath that business.

128
00:08:05,941 --> 00:08:10,143
Scott: So, you know, they did all the manga style in a while back, you know which I guess they do.

129
00:08:10,163 --> 00:08:11,791
Scott: I always see people have the.

130
00:08:11,831 --> 00:08:26,540
Scott: the bags from the store always have like Going to guy characters on them, but now apparently in the spring It's gonna be all video game actions gonna be Sega Capcom Taito Sony Bandai Hudson.

131
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,767
Rym: We've got to get in on this.

132
00:08:28,828 --> 00:08:30,453
Scott: We're looking at some Sonic the Hedgehog.

133
00:08:30,473 --> 00:08:34,863
Scott: We're looking at some Megaman looking some breakout Prap of the rapper.

134
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:43,505
Rym: I'm glad we're seeing like the biggest increase in my wardrobe the biggest purging and then rebuilding that I've had Since I got to RIT.

135
00:08:43,866 --> 00:08:50,565
Scott: Yeah, so we're gonna have to go, you know, we'll head over there and like March or whatever Shopping.

136
00:08:50,746 --> 00:08:51,630
Rym: Oh my gosh shoes.

137
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:57,920
Scott: Yeah a little little Megaman shirt going on But a high-class Megaman shirt not some crap ass Megaman.

138
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:08,720
Rym: it's always like with anime stuff and even a lot of video game stuff the difference between the Big square print of the red dragon versus the classy stylized red dragon or the big square print of all.

139
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:14,980
Scott: Strange how you can have like, you know, you can have like a like a shirt has Megaman on it But then you have a shirt with Megaman on it.

140
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:18,200
Scott: That is like actually not lame and it's hard to tell with the differences.

141
00:09:18,421 --> 00:09:28,622
Rym: But the extra part is if you go too far into the lame spectrum It gets into that kind of hipster retro or ironic territory and suddenly it's cool again Like if it's.

142
00:09:28,923 --> 00:09:33,442
Rym: if it's a really really lame shirt, it's totally awesome Uh-huh.

143
00:09:33,724 --> 00:09:37,180
Rym: So I'm not sure where the line is because you know, there's a bottom of that trend.

144
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:43,460
Rym: There's a point at which it's the worst possible shirt and then and then it becomes iconic like that red dragon shirt.

145
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,977
Rym: You all know which one I'm talking about.

146
00:09:46,102 --> 00:09:48,392
Scott: We should find a picture of that red dragon shirt.

147
00:09:48,412 --> 00:09:51,973
Scott: be like if you are wearing this shirt You are that guy.

148
00:09:51,993 --> 00:09:54,266
Scott: if You own this shirt.

149
00:09:54,306 --> 00:09:55,189
Scott: You are that guy.

150
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:58,020
Rym: do not wear this shirt, but a lot of us owned that shirt.

151
00:09:58,141 --> 00:10:00,704
Scott: I oh I never owned that shirt Although I did see it.

152
00:10:01,286 --> 00:10:05,339
Rym: I did in fact own that shirt in middle school, but I did not wear it that often.

153
00:10:06,082 --> 00:10:06,765
Rym: That often.

154
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:19,408
Rym: well the thing is when I was in middle school in the Midwest The fashion was the thing that guys were allowed to wear was somewhat raggedy jeans Or corduroys again with cords

155
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,855
Scott: and red dragon shirts some

156
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:30,433
Rym: sort of dumb t-shirt Like a lot of people would wear like their dare t-shirt But totally ironically and then a flannel shirt over that unbuttoned.

157
00:10:31,175 --> 00:10:32,740
Rym: That was like the prescribed style.

158
00:10:32,881 --> 00:10:34,467
Rym: No one was allowed to deviate from what.

159
00:10:34,487 --> 00:10:36,113
Rym: if you did I don't know but ever.

160
00:10:36,134 --> 00:10:37,037
Rym: that's what everyone dressed like.

161
00:10:37,077 --> 00:10:37,640
Rym: it was middle school.

162
00:10:38,282 --> 00:10:39,846
Rym: Yeah, I dressed like that.

163
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:44,279
Rym: I'd alternate between the red dragon and the dare and the nondescript black.

164
00:10:45,986 --> 00:10:48,146
Scott: Anyway Yeah, this is pretty.

165
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:49,494
Scott: this is pretty good news right here.

166
00:10:49,514 --> 00:10:50,540
Scott: I got a. I don't know.

167
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,730
Scott: I got a lot of t-shirts and it's like the oldest ones.

168
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:58,806
Scott: I can't get rid of for whatever reason some of the you know and it's like Now.

169
00:10:58,847 --> 00:11:06,819
Scott: it's like I've got like three tiers of t-shirt And it's like I keep adding a newer better tier and then somehow the slightly the what used to be the top tier moves down.

170
00:11:07,763 --> 00:11:09,179
Scott: But I can't get rid of any of them.

171
00:11:10,282 --> 00:11:11,490
Rym: The worst thing is I have the product.

172
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:14,016
Rym: I gotta buy new socks like every sock I own has a hole in it.

173
00:11:14,421 --> 00:11:24,512
Rym: But I feel like if I buy new socks without destroying the old socks And I put these new socks in my drawer with the old socks the next time I open it It'll still all be old socks.

174
00:11:25,155 --> 00:11:26,160
Rym: It seems to happen to me.

175
00:11:26,421 --> 00:11:26,722
Rym: I don't know.

176
00:11:26,882 --> 00:11:27,164
Rym: I don't know.

177
00:11:27,204 --> 00:11:29,593
Rym: if they convert maybe the old socks eat him.

178
00:11:29,714 --> 00:11:30,136
Rym: I don't know.

179
00:11:30,316 --> 00:11:30,778
Scott: no it's.

180
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:31,240
Scott: it's true.

181
00:11:31,602 --> 00:11:34,280
Scott: I got rid of all my old socks and bought all new ones a couple years ago.

182
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,686
Scott: I'll probably do it in another year, too.

183
00:11:35,706 --> 00:11:36,610
Scott: It's.

184
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:37,614
Scott: it's a very good idea.

185
00:11:37,755 --> 00:11:47,580
Rym: doesn't help that to this day I can't figure out which Visigoth it is but one of our friends Invariably will leave like the worst most stretched out crew socks ever.

186
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:50,250
Scott: I don't know how people wear such thin useless socks.

187
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:52,920
Scott: It's like you're better off wearing no socks, but they're so stretched out.

188
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,026
Rym: They've got to be either.

189
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,479
Rym: They must either have club feet, and we don't know about.

190
00:11:56,499 --> 00:11:57,326
Rym: yeah That's another thing.

191
00:11:57,346 --> 00:12:01,674
Scott: like such stretched out socks It's like a sock needs to be like you know.

192
00:12:01,694 --> 00:12:02,800
Rym: you could buy it one size.

193
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:07,600
Scott: Yeah, like if the sock is stretched out, then it must be like falling down around the ankle.

194
00:12:07,721 --> 00:12:11,860
Scott: It's like first of all I get socks that don't go very high up except in the winter, right?

195
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,851
Rym: Oh come on you gotta rock the knee socks, and if they do go up.

196
00:12:15,172 --> 00:12:16,538
Scott: They got to stay up.

197
00:12:17,261 --> 00:12:18,809
Scott: They can't be flopping down.

198
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,338
Rym: Do you remember the the Seinfeld about?

199
00:12:20,358 --> 00:12:20,479
Rym: yes?

200
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,919
Scott: I was referring to the Seinfeld about that.

201
00:12:24,842 --> 00:12:29,596
Rym: Well, then but but moving on back to video games a bit it finally happened.

202
00:12:29,676 --> 00:12:31,120
Rym: No one didn't see this coming.

203
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:36,499
Rym: There were rumblings about this in like July of last year that this would happen mm-hmm.

204
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,024
Rym: But uh wrath of the Lich King is coming to fallout 3.

205
00:12:41,024 --> 00:12:42,592
Rym: There's doubt there is an expansion.

206
00:12:42,612 --> 00:12:48,054
Rym: well actually multiple expansions Pay downloadable content for the single-player game.

207
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:49,559
Rym: fallout 3. it is here.

208
00:12:50,182 --> 00:12:52,911
Rym: You're going to have it well depending on the price.

209
00:12:52,951 --> 00:12:55,198
Scott: I mean is that really any different from an expansion pack?

210
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,563
Rym: well It's tricky.

211
00:12:56,603 --> 00:12:59,053
Scott: It seems like it's an ok DLC right.

212
00:12:59,213 --> 00:13:00,880
Scott: I mean it's like 10 bucks or something like that.

213
00:13:01,321 --> 00:13:08,409
Rym: The interesting part is that there's a lot of strong feelings on both sides of the issue And I think on the negative side the biggest fears.

214
00:13:08,449 --> 00:13:10,214
Rym: I always see people bringing up or that one.

215
00:13:10,676 --> 00:13:21,258
Rym: what if developers start Making games, but then purposefully Removing things that they would have just put in the game Knowing that the game will sell anyway, and then they can sell it as DLC for five more bucks later?

216
00:13:21,941 --> 00:13:24,790
Scott: see that's the thing is like a get a video game right.

217
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:32,140
Scott: you pay 50 bucks for it and some you know and Usually pay 50 bucks for like a retail console or PC game.

218
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:39,460
Scott: Maybe 60 bucks right and there is no sort of accepted standard for like how much content that should be.

219
00:13:40,263 --> 00:13:41,950
Scott: So it's like you go to see the movies.

220
00:13:42,252 --> 00:13:48,818
Scott: you expect at least a 90 minute movie Right and if a movie was like a half hour people wouldn't be paying full price to see it.

221
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:49,240
Scott: right?

222
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,092
Scott: It's sort of like there's an accepted length for these things right?

223
00:13:52,533 --> 00:13:54,080
Scott: so you go to the bookstore right?

224
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,267
Scott: Smaller books are cheaper than the bigger books.

225
00:13:57,348 --> 00:13:59,734
Scott: hardcover is more expensive than softcover.

226
00:13:59,754 --> 00:14:08,992
Scott: You know there's sort of this accepted pricing scale in relation to what you're getting and You know up until you know a while back.

227
00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:10,980
Scott: You know even in the NES days, right?

228
00:14:11,381 --> 00:14:14,069
Scott: You sort of paid the same price for any video game.

229
00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:17,157
Scott: yet some video games gave you more and some gave you less.

230
00:14:17,819 --> 00:14:28,744
Scott: so Now basically the companies are taking advantage of this lack of a standard accepted game content size To make lots of money.

231
00:14:28,824 --> 00:14:35,106
Scott: right they're making like portable games for the cell phone charge in 10 bucks for which probably should be $1.

232
00:14:35,106 --> 00:14:38,848
Scott: Right they're taking Really big games and selling them.

233
00:14:39,048 --> 00:14:43,803
Scott: you know cuz you can't charge a lot more than 50 bucks for any game No matter how big.

234
00:14:44,064 --> 00:14:53,860
Rym: I think back in the day Zelda to Mario 3 and worst were 70 bucks And that was like a crazy outline like you would go to the store the Toys R Us or the Children's Palace.

235
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,190
Rym: I just stand there staring at it.

236
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,038
Rym: That was more money than you could imagine.

237
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:07,030
Scott: yep So it's like you can't sell any game any game no matter how big or how crazy for more than like 50 60 bucks At least that once.

238
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:12,840
Scott: right you could do a subscription But you can't charge a one-time fee if it's one of those boutique games.

239
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:21,042
Rym: I mean I remember back in the day when I was playing like the realm and all those old MMOs Someone made a small yeah like fancy flight simulators can be like a hundred bucks You know.

240
00:15:21,082 --> 00:15:34,080
Rym: like that there were a few like clothes mugs and clothes like little MMOs Where you paid like what caught a hundred bucks or so and then you still paid a monthly fee, but they were like these Walled garden private like awesome communities.

241
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,560
Scott: Yeah, but I'm talking about it for a normal video game for PC or console.

242
00:15:38,002 --> 00:15:40,937
Scott: You know it's gonna be 50 60 bucks is the most you're gonna get away with.

243
00:15:41,038 --> 00:15:49,060
Scott: I definitely When people want to make a game that's bigger than 50 or 60 bucks right because I mean fallout 3 is really big.

244
00:15:49,141 --> 00:15:57,096
Scott: I mean a lot of stuff in that game repeats itself You know But it's a really big game, and it's like a long time and a lot of money to make.

245
00:15:57,176 --> 00:15:58,453
Scott: so they want to make more money.

246
00:15:59,383 --> 00:16:03,040
Scott: They can't charge more than 50 or 60 bucks at once because no one's gonna pay.

247
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:12,197
Scott: so they've got to sell sort of 50 bucks worth and Then sort of sell you more later in order to get more than the 50 bucks.

248
00:16:12,397 --> 00:16:13,623
Scott: Yep, otherwise They're just.

249
00:16:13,683 --> 00:16:14,286
Scott: they're not gonna be.

250
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,614
Scott: they're gonna have to make the game smaller.

251
00:16:15,855 --> 00:16:19,652
Rym: of course it also Really depends on what it is that they're selling.

252
00:16:19,773 --> 00:16:37,680
Scott: at the same time though some other people Right are gonna make some $20 game and sell it for 50 bucks because 50 bucks is what you can get away with and there's Standard for it, and I really think we sort of need to Have some sort of market pressure that pushes You know the games that you know to lower in price and higher in price based on what you're getting.

253
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,140
Rym: You know it's kind of like the issue they have on the iTunes store where?

254
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:50,048
Rym: Everything is priced at these few like there's few price points and actually this really relates to the stock market Because I just did a whole bunch of training on this.

255
00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:51,435
Rym: we were talking about decimalization.

256
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:56,460
Rym: now that was when Regulations change and it used to be that you could only trade at certain price points.

257
00:16:56,962 --> 00:17:01,345
Rym: So like every say I'm not gonna get to the details But say every eighth of a cent.

258
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:04,034
Rym: those are like the minimum intervals you could jump.

259
00:17:04,054 --> 00:17:05,880
Rym: a lot of board games have the same thing.

260
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:12,782
Rym: Like I'm on ray you can bid but the bidding chain like if you want to outbid someone you have to outbid them by a Certain amount.

261
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,232
Rym: you can't say you can't.

262
00:17:14,271 --> 00:17:15,599
Scott: you can't bid like a half dollar.

263
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,569
Scott: It's the one dollar is the least you can bid.

264
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:21,165
Rym: yes, but when they introduced decimalization They said you could bid down to the penny.

265
00:17:21,587 --> 00:17:29,534
Rym: so instead of the price is being forced to fall into these Categories of like for video games the $5 game the $20 game the $50 game the $60 game.

266
00:17:31,983 --> 00:17:32,486
Rym: There are $5 games.

267
00:17:32,506 --> 00:17:33,070
Rym: there are $20 games.

268
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:37,883
Rym: there are $45 games it But it's not like.

269
00:17:37,903 --> 00:17:40,029
Rym: there's regulation forcing video games to be this way.

270
00:17:40,089 --> 00:17:52,656
Rym: the market is kind of enforcing it with these semi unrealistic expectations where people expect games to cost $50 and include X or Cost $10 and include why like?

271
00:17:52,817 --> 00:18:09,138
Rym: and that's part I think what's holding back a lot of like Nintendo downloadable content like that or the Xbox Live stuff even is that you could make a really awesome game in there But you can't sell the game for more than a certain amount or people will just not even look at it even though it might Be well worth the money.

272
00:18:09,982 --> 00:18:16,940
Scott: Yeah, that's why you see something like Wario shake Which is pretty good, but it came out for 50 bucks on the Wii when it probably could have come out for 30.

273
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:17,201
Scott: It's like.

274
00:18:17,282 --> 00:18:25,536
Scott: you know it didn't cost them 50 bucks because I mean like it cost the same exact price as Twilight Princess Which obviously cost a zillion more dollars to make than Wario shake it.

275
00:18:25,957 --> 00:18:28,028
Scott: yeah, it's the same You know for the same console.

276
00:18:28,048 --> 00:18:28,974
Scott: It's like come on.

277
00:18:29,014 --> 00:18:29,798
Scott: Give me a break here.

278
00:18:30,483 --> 00:18:36,594
Rym: Personally for me when it comes to this sort of thing these expansions It really depends on how much it costs and what it is.

279
00:18:36,654 --> 00:18:42,053
Rym: I mean remember wasn't it oblivion That had those the downloadable content that lets you look different.

280
00:18:42,314 --> 00:18:42,716
Scott: I don't know.

281
00:18:42,756 --> 00:18:43,880
Scott: I never I don't know anything about it.

282
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,548
Rym: We talked about it.

283
00:18:44,609 --> 00:18:58,275
Rym: I think way back They were like yeah for if you pay whatever dollar amount You get these extra set of hats in this single-player game that no one in the world will ever see, but you Great, it's like buying virtual clothes for your virtual doll.

284
00:18:59,299 --> 00:19:00,160
Rym: I Don't think I'm down.

285
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:01,946
Scott: I mean I can.

286
00:19:02,046 --> 00:19:08,539
Scott: actually I can respect a game more if it makes you push like you know grind To get a new hat in a single-player game.

287
00:19:08,821 --> 00:19:17,126
Rym: Then if it makes you pay money to get a new hat is I mean at least in a multiplayer game like if I pay five bucks for the Black Baldrick I can show it to other people.

288
00:19:17,146 --> 00:19:21,440
Scott: Yeah, that's still sad, but at least it's a little bit better than the single-player game.

289
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,239
Rym: It's less sad.

290
00:19:23,461 --> 00:19:25,633
Rym: There's a long continuum of sadness.

291
00:19:25,694 --> 00:19:26,096
Scott: there is.

292
00:19:26,116 --> 00:19:29,851
Scott: it's all sad But that's less said but like or say they're like.

293
00:19:30,052 --> 00:19:34,974
Rym: one of the things that I don't like is that one of the expansions Gives you it ups the level cap in Fallout.

294
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:35,477
Rym: It's like.

295
00:19:35,638 --> 00:19:36,020
Rym: why?

296
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,140
Scott: Well, I guess it makes the game.

297
00:19:38,361 --> 00:19:39,705
Scott: I mean I I got.

298
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:44,865
Scott: you know I got level 20 shortly before beating the game and stopping playing you know and I didn't try To level up.

299
00:19:44,946 --> 00:19:46,220
Scott: I just sort of got level.

300
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:46,561
Rym: That was.

301
00:19:46,582 --> 00:19:49,815
Rym: the biggest complain people had about the game was that it was too easy to level up.

302
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:50,860
Rym: They wanted more grind.

303
00:19:51,701 --> 00:19:52,244
Scott: They're stupid.

304
00:19:52,264 --> 00:19:54,374
Rym: seriously that is like the biggest complaint.

305
00:19:54,434 --> 00:19:55,720
Rym: I've seen going through forums.

306
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:00,040
Scott: No, they're stupid, but I mean I didn't have maxed out all the skills.

307
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:04,227
Scott: I mean there was still some things that I could Could not do.

308
00:20:04,247 --> 00:20:06,580
Rym: I guess the intent couldn't get any more levels.

309
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:14,130
Scott: So if I decided to you know I could load up my save game from before I actually beat the game and got the ending and I could.

310
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:17,200
Scott: I got the thing that lets me see every place on the map.

311
00:20:17,882 --> 00:20:26,400
Scott: I could go around and go to all the places on the map and do everything if I wanted to and maybe I you know Maybe I would want to do that right, but I could never get more levels.

312
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:33,879
Scott: So like I've mostly concentrated in guns and such to make you know to make it easier to kill things So I can get through the game without with less stress.

313
00:20:34,582 --> 00:20:38,033
Scott: But as a result I was unable to hack like a whole bunch of computers.

314
00:20:38,374 --> 00:20:40,380
Scott: like I wasn't able to do anything cool with robots.

315
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:49,559
Scott: They always killed me right, but if I you raise the level cap to 30 Then I would have been able to go back and try to do some of those other things that I couldn't do.

316
00:20:49,579 --> 00:20:59,692
Scott: you know I could lock pick some of those 100 lock pick doors and stuff like that and You know the thing is why does that cost money?

317
00:20:59,752 --> 00:21:01,759
Scott: all you do is change a number in the game.

318
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:04,120
Scott: literally I think now I can go to level 30.

319
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:15,410
Rym: I think the original intent of this was that you're supposed to play through the game like an old fallout Multiple times kind of being a different person like I'll be the heckery guy and go through the whole game like a heckery guy Or I'll be the evil badass.

320
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:16,335
Rym: I'll go through the whole game.

321
00:21:16,395 --> 00:21:17,260
Rym: is the evil badass?

322
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,630
Scott: I see the thing is I watched all the game endings.

323
00:21:19,691 --> 00:21:25,016
Scott: cuz this you know when you end unlike other fallouts I've heard that you after you beat the game you keep playing and this fallout.

324
00:21:25,056 --> 00:21:27,287
Scott: when you beat the game It's done, and you have to.

325
00:21:27,447 --> 00:21:31,630
Scott: if you want to keep playing you have to load a save game from before Depending on what you choose.

326
00:21:31,671 --> 00:21:32,436
Rym: that makes sense.

327
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,895
Scott: well Yeah, but so I got.

328
00:21:34,936 --> 00:21:36,789
Scott: I beat the game And I got the goody-goody ending.

329
00:21:36,809 --> 00:21:43,999
Scott: cuz I was a goody-goody guy, right I was like the best goody-goody you could be and even though I freaking blew everyone's brains out who was bad?

330
00:21:45,442 --> 00:21:46,167
Rym: That makes you good.

331
00:21:46,227 --> 00:21:47,776
Rym: It's pummel empathy exactly?

332
00:21:47,896 --> 00:21:54,480
Scott: um well I guess it's bullet empathy, and I went on YouTube to watch the other endings, and they were not significantly different.

333
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,839
Scott: They were definitely not worth playing the entire game again.

334
00:21:58,565 --> 00:22:00,060
Scott: Not we're not even close.

335
00:22:00,501 --> 00:22:11,786
Scott: So I would never under any circumstance want to start the game over even though I might You know want to say load up the game before the ending and go Explore some unexplored areas.

336
00:22:11,806 --> 00:22:15,718
Scott: cuz really the good part about the game is the exploring and all the other parts of kind of play.

337
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:19,164
Rym: now the interesting one is Operation anchorage.

338
00:22:19,245 --> 00:22:20,348
Rym: now that did you?

339
00:22:20,368 --> 00:22:22,153
Rym: do you know anything about the Battle of Anchorage?

340
00:22:22,354 --> 00:22:22,715
Scott: Yes?

341
00:22:23,076 --> 00:22:23,297
Rym: Yeah?

342
00:22:23,317 --> 00:22:24,240
Rym: Do you know a lot about it?

343
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,331
Scott: I know what I learned playing the game once.

344
00:22:26,572 --> 00:22:32,220
Rym: well what they've added What they're going to add is there's a point where you can go to a VR simulation in the game.

345
00:22:32,462 --> 00:22:36,556
Scott: Yeah, that was actually a part of the game I was impressed with because it was the it sort of felt.

346
00:22:36,576 --> 00:22:38,639
Scott: when I got there I was like wow this is the end of the game.

347
00:22:39,243 --> 00:22:42,619
Scott: And it totally wasn't even though in like in other games that would have been the end.

348
00:22:43,121 --> 00:22:49,757
Rym: So but what you can do is they want you to be able to play that battle in a tactical like.

349
00:22:49,777 --> 00:22:53,500
Rym: it's not because fallout is Not an FPS, and there's very little.

350
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:55,585
Scott: I sort of wish it was.

351
00:22:55,645 --> 00:23:02,551
Scott: I wish like someone could like hack the game and make it an actual FPS and remove the RPG from the.

352
00:23:02,713 --> 00:23:05,848
Rym: oh my god Don't get me started cuz that would be fucking awesome.

353
00:23:06,089 --> 00:23:12,240
Rym: because the thing the problem with the game for me not for everyone I mean everyone has different taste in games, but it's not an FPS.

354
00:23:12,826 --> 00:23:16,884
Rym: Fallout 3 requires Zero really skill.

355
00:23:16,985 --> 00:23:27,880
Rym: It's just a game of do like you do the right basic options fight things and level up in the right way Manage your ammo right and you won't lose or die unless you do something really stupid.

356
00:23:28,422 --> 00:23:36,760
Scott: So yeah unless he goes somewhere where there happens to be extreme danger like a lot of times I'll speed walk somewhere, and they'll be really dangerous guys, and then you can't escape and you die.

357
00:23:36,861 --> 00:23:38,236
Scott: But nothing you could do about that.

358
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:42,060
Rym: yep But as a result the game doesn't require any skill.

359
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:42,683
Rym: You don't really.

360
00:23:42,884 --> 00:23:46,520
Rym: you're not better at the game by the end of it than you were when you started.

361
00:23:47,082 --> 00:23:49,752
Rym: But what this is other than having more goodies?

362
00:23:50,253 --> 00:23:52,040
Rym: what this is added is a an actual?

363
00:23:52,381 --> 00:23:57,982
Rym: Tactical game where you make a squad and you pick your team members like snipers heavy weapons guys Whatever.

364
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:05,869
Rym: you give them orders or tactics and you play this kind of strategy tactical Simulate the battle game.

365
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:07,840
Scott: Yeah, I don't know about strategy or tactile.

366
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,407
Scott: It's gonna be.

367
00:24:08,427 --> 00:24:09,440
Rym: I don't think so either.

368
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,666
Rym: But what's interesting?

369
00:24:10,686 --> 00:24:21,127
Rym: that they're basically if this is to be believed fully Adding a real-time first-person strategy fighting game To fallout which is otherwise.

370
00:24:21,187 --> 00:24:24,137
Scott: and our thing is it's not yeah, but it's not a strategy.

371
00:24:24,177 --> 00:24:27,140
Rym: if it's all RPG Well, I don't think it's all RPG.

372
00:24:27,401 --> 00:24:28,043
Rym: I mean it's kind of.

373
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:30,150
Rym: I think it's gonna take place in the simulator.

374
00:24:30,451 --> 00:24:31,434
Scott: the simulator was.

375
00:24:31,675 --> 00:24:33,701
Scott: it was no different than the outside of The game.

376
00:24:33,942 --> 00:24:35,467
Rym: yes except that it'll.

377
00:24:35,487 --> 00:24:39,660
Rym: maybe it'll give you the weapons and things that fit for that fit world.

378
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,366
Rym: So you have the same loadout.

379
00:24:41,406 --> 00:24:45,399
Rym: what will make the difference is what points you attack or where you go and teammates you choose?

380
00:24:46,183 --> 00:24:48,819
Rym: Quotes the player will be able to choose from a limited resource pool.

381
00:24:49,201 --> 00:24:52,939
Rym: See that's why types of team members will accompany him on several missions within the simulations.

382
00:24:53,744 --> 00:24:56,100
Rym: Choices include different troop types like snipers every weapons.

383
00:24:56,421 --> 00:25:00,180
Rym: They'll also be able to make tactical decisions on how to deploy these troops in certain situations.

384
00:25:00,623 --> 00:25:03,560
Scott: That sounds to me like a lot of you know games these days.

385
00:25:04,001 --> 00:25:06,226
Scott: They do things that for tip.

386
00:25:06,266 --> 00:25:13,549
Scott: for most lay people appear to be strategy and tactics and they'll even you know They'll say oh the game's so strategic.

387
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:19,073
Scott: normal people will say that but from a Actual game perspective, which few people understand it.

388
00:25:19,615 --> 00:25:28,420
Scott: There's actually no strategy Like someone will make a really complex rock-paper-scissors and somebody like all this game so strategic not realizing It's actually just a complex rock-paper-scissors.

389
00:25:28,821 --> 00:25:40,220
Rym: well, actually it's funny because about I'm I'm crying about three-quarters of way through an article on Stratego for an upcoming project And which is really just a complex rock-paper-scissors.

390
00:25:40,561 --> 00:25:56,024
Rym: No, actually what I'm writing a lot about how when in suboptimal play and this is true across many games in suboptimal play There is emergent behavior and emergent tactical thought and emergent options that don't exist Among skilled players.

391
00:25:56,084 --> 00:26:16,259
Rym: so by playing games that are above your level by playing games where you're a novice or you're not strategically optimal the game is Probably more fun and the end result is that you should play games that are above your mental level Because you'll have more options more tactics more thought and the game will generally be more interesting for you.

392
00:26:16,947 --> 00:26:17,720
Scott: Yeah, that's true.

393
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:24,077
Scott: If you play a game that you're perfect at there's no thinking about strategies because you already know what there's.

394
00:26:24,117 --> 00:26:25,924
Rym: there's no strategy The other way around.

395
00:26:25,944 --> 00:26:29,360
Rym: like Stratego the game is strategic at the high level of play.

396
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,160
Rym: The problem is there's no tactics.

397
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:36,840
Rym: You'd might as well just set up your two boards and then everyone just turn their pieces around and you can figure out who.

398
00:26:37,161 --> 00:26:38,646
Scott: Well playing the game is.

399
00:26:38,686 --> 00:26:42,661
Scott: sorry because there's no way to figure out by looking at how you set up the board who was gonna Win.

400
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:45,394
Rym: you'd have to actually I would argue that mathematically.

401
00:26:45,434 --> 00:26:47,375
Scott: there is mathematically But you don't it's.

402
00:26:47,436 --> 00:26:47,781
Scott: you know It's.

403
00:26:47,841 --> 00:26:49,668
Scott: it's not an easy thing to just to do like.

404
00:26:49,709 --> 00:26:57,057
Scott: you can't like if I just set up the board and flipped it over Could you just say oh so and so one maybe for some configurations, but not all.

405
00:26:57,298 --> 00:27:00,337
Scott: yes playing It is sort of figuring out who set theirs up better.

406
00:27:00,417 --> 00:27:04,708
Rym: Yes, it is But the thing is you're not when you're playing Stratego You're not when you're an optimal player.

407
00:27:04,728 --> 00:27:07,139
Rym: the playing of it is not a game.

408
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:07,420
Scott: now.

409
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:12,078
Rym: It's not just following the algorithm that will tell you which original starting setup won the game.

410
00:27:12,118 --> 00:27:12,660
Scott: That is correct.

411
00:27:12,861 --> 00:27:13,583
Rym: That is all it is.

412
00:27:13,603 --> 00:27:14,868
Scott: That is correct.

413
00:27:14,888 --> 00:27:17,800
Rym: So once I write a program that does that we've solved Stratego.

414
00:27:18,282 --> 00:27:19,668
Scott: Yes, that is also correct.

415
00:27:20,029 --> 00:27:27,073
Scott: But anyway, it's a lot sort of like Like NFL football versus college football, you know, it's like in college football.

416
00:27:27,093 --> 00:27:29,060
Scott: There's all sorts of crazy shit going on.

417
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,705
Scott: It's real interesting for spectators.

418
00:27:30,765 --> 00:27:32,009
Scott: It's real interesting for players.

419
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:33,654
Scott: You have a lot of different options.

420
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:35,700
Scott: a lot of different plays become feasible.

421
00:27:36,022 --> 00:27:50,567
Scott: I actually made the NFL where the players are far superior Right and everyone knows all you can't pull these shenanigans because the other team is too smart Unless they're like, you know the Chiefs or something analogy I make you can't use.

422
00:27:50,667 --> 00:27:52,737
Scott: so your options are far far fewer.

423
00:27:52,898 --> 00:28:00,480
Rym: the analogies I make are one like a child playing chess for you Like you put your queen in a spot that'll get something and you hope the guy doesn't notice.

424
00:28:00,841 --> 00:28:03,310
Rym: Yeah, that's a strategy that works when two kids are playing chess.

425
00:28:03,611 --> 00:28:05,859
Rym: It doesn't work if you're playing chess against an adult.

426
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:06,421
Rym: No It's.

427
00:28:06,521 --> 00:28:09,049
Rym: or like in Little League the trick plays.

428
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:10,033
Scott: Yeah in lit, right?

429
00:28:10,053 --> 00:28:12,260
Scott: That's a perfect example in Little League baseball, right?

430
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,749
Scott: Well, they're in any baseball right?

431
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:15,754
Scott: It is perfectly legal.

432
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:17,100
Scott: Let's say you get a walk, right?

433
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,546
Scott: So someone throws four balls.

434
00:28:18,848 --> 00:28:23,169
Scott: you walk to first base and then just start running to second Oh my god, and then just start running to second.

435
00:28:23,189 --> 00:28:23,712
Scott: you can do that.

436
00:28:23,872 --> 00:28:25,480
Scott: There's no reason you can't do that, right?

437
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:30,520
Scott: You just you have a free walk to first base, but you're like you can try to keep going a second.

438
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:36,987
Rym: They can't balk but at the same time what if you did some sleight of hand and the pitcher's standing there But he don't have the ball?

439
00:28:37,289 --> 00:28:38,879
Rym: the guy at second base has the ball.

440
00:28:39,683 --> 00:28:40,707
Scott: Yeah, right.

441
00:28:40,767 --> 00:28:42,856
Scott: So that shit doesn't fly in the major leagues notice.

442
00:28:42,876 --> 00:28:54,640
Scott: in Major League Baseball Everyone walks to first base slowly and calmly but in Little League baseball They run to first base and a lot of times they'll just keep running a second because the Little League kids it works on them.

443
00:28:55,181 --> 00:28:55,883
Scott: so that's it's.

444
00:28:56,024 --> 00:28:57,850
Scott: these extra options are available.

445
00:28:58,171 --> 00:29:04,993
Scott: when you play an amateur, you know play with amateurs and Professionals are playing and smart people are playing.

446
00:29:05,013 --> 00:29:06,920
Scott: these options are not there.

447
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,810
Rym: However, I feel like wall fallout 3 is not going to do this.

448
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:12,420
Rym: There is potential for that sort of game.

449
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:21,490
Rym: It's like a meld between the Marines of NS but with a more single-player Commanding from the front lines perspective.

450
00:29:21,932 --> 00:29:24,180
Rym: I got a lot of vague ideas about it, but nothing concrete yet.

451
00:29:24,441 --> 00:29:29,600
Scott: See, I'm not really interested in like some an expansion pack like that that gives you like this battle to do.

452
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:33,620
Rym: I would be but I would be more interested in the history of the world.

453
00:29:33,902 --> 00:29:52,559
Scott: I would be interested in the other expansion pack maybe that sort of lets you keep playing after the game and adds a whole bunch more quests and hope maybe even adds more land to The map like more just more stuff that that might be worth as long as it's cheap like five ten bucks Depending on how much they give and how much I feel like it.

454
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:58,366
Scott: You know that and if I can load up my old character and I have to start again stuff like that Maybe I'll be interested.

455
00:29:58,406 --> 00:30:05,668
Rym: It looks like it's gonna be 800 Microsoft points or Pounds or nine point six euros.

456
00:30:06,431 --> 00:30:07,635
Scott: It's like 20 bucks.

457
00:30:07,635 --> 00:30:09,340
Scott: 18 bucks something like that.

458
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,982
Rym: Well, it depends if that could all change any day.

459
00:30:12,482 --> 00:30:12,803
Scott: Yeah.

460
00:30:12,943 --> 00:30:13,643
Scott: Yeah what to see.

461
00:30:20,248 --> 00:30:22,210
Rym: but anyway things of the day.

462
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:25,105
Rym: This is a machinima.

463
00:30:26,731 --> 00:30:34,800
Rym: What I can say about it primarily is that the voice acting is surprisingly good and it beats Expectations by a large margin.

464
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,107
Rym: I mean way back.

465
00:30:36,147 --> 00:30:36,710
Rym: we used that old.

466
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:39,041
Rym: There was that pyro machinima for Team Fortress 2 and it was.

467
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:50,354
Rym: it was really good for the first half but then it really just kind of petered out and I think the the Overwhelming consensus was that that machinima was one of those zero-day businesses And there was.

468
00:30:50,635 --> 00:30:51,580
Rym: it was just hey, let's make one.

469
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,565
Rym: Oh my god were the first ones.

470
00:30:52,605 --> 00:30:53,268
Rym: everyone's watching it.

471
00:30:54,391 --> 00:30:59,749
Rym: This is pretty funny and every time you think you see where it's going with the jokes it pulls one on you.

472
00:31:00,991 --> 00:31:04,124
Scott: Yeah, some of the jokes are obvious, but some of them are pretty clever.

473
00:31:04,406 --> 00:31:10,370
Rym: Yeah, I don't know I really like the the the thing that the blue team has built because they're bored.

474
00:31:10,691 --> 00:31:13,579
Scott: Yeah, that is classic and that's what FPS is are all about.

475
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:21,934
Scott: Oh my god That and all the only that's what I'm saying is why they really need to get the the physics the half-life 2 physics stuff going On in the multiplayer.

476
00:31:21,954 --> 00:31:22,958
Scott: so shit like that can happen.

477
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:30,256
Rym: as we said if left for dead had half-life 2 physics That might have been a game for all time Maybe as opposed to just a six-month.

478
00:31:30,276 --> 00:31:34,170
Scott: mean the only one that really has is the half-life 2 deathmatch for everyone's got gravity guns.

479
00:31:34,251 --> 00:31:38,255
Scott: Throwing shit at each other is setting people on fire Exploding barrels, right?

480
00:31:38,576 --> 00:31:40,281
Scott: Why isn't that in left for dead?

481
00:31:40,321 --> 00:31:42,949
Scott: Why isn't that in tf2 or even imagine NS?

482
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:44,816
Rym: Yeah, man.

483
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:52,701
Scott: Yeah, it could be okay someday someday Alright, so, you know how people always talk about villains being stupid right?

484
00:31:52,741 --> 00:31:54,706
Scott: Like why doesn't like?

485
00:31:54,786 --> 00:31:56,290
Rym: obviously none of them are rezo.

486
00:31:56,975 --> 00:32:02,024
Scott: Well, yeah, it's true except for rezo Maybe chevron egg dough and maybe no chevron egg though.

487
00:32:02,044 --> 00:32:03,510
Scott: Well, I guess yeah, he wasn't stupid.

488
00:32:03,711 --> 00:32:05,101
Rym: He was like, well, here it is.

489
00:32:05,121 --> 00:32:08,439
Rym: There's the thing that can be strong Like Koopa, right?

490
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,388
Scott: Why doesn't he just send like all?

491
00:32:12,551 --> 00:32:14,918
Scott: The like spiky beetles all at once.

492
00:32:15,018 --> 00:32:15,941
Scott: so why does?

493
00:32:16,282 --> 00:32:17,987
Scott: why does he just make a pit so big?

494
00:32:18,027 --> 00:32:19,030
Scott: Mario can't jump over.

495
00:32:19,293 --> 00:32:23,510
Rym: I have the answer to that Because if he made it it's a 2d world, right?

496
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,278
Scott: I just send ten hammer brothers at once.

497
00:32:25,358 --> 00:32:26,845
Scott: Mario can't possibly beat them all.

498
00:32:26,985 --> 00:32:27,447
Rym: it's a 2d world.

499
00:32:28,952 --> 00:32:31,650
Rym: If he made a pit bigger than he could anyone could jump across.

500
00:32:32,711 --> 00:32:35,543
Rym: He's basically made a pit in the world that no one can cross.

501
00:32:35,603 --> 00:32:38,454
Rym: cutting off that part of the world forever That's fine.

502
00:32:38,655 --> 00:32:39,901
Scott: make two big pits.

503
00:32:39,941 --> 00:32:41,610
Scott: no one can cross with Mario in the middle.

504
00:32:41,711 --> 00:32:43,670
Rym: But how does he get food from the 2d farms?

505
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:45,850
Rym: I mean you got a thing a real world like one thing.

506
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:48,881
Scott: Mario is on this tiny spit of land.

507
00:32:48,901 --> 00:32:50,830
Scott: on both sides of him are pits.

508
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:52,034
Rym: He cannot build it.

509
00:32:52,155 --> 00:32:55,867
Scott: Mario's there and Luigi's there too if the world even that the world is 2d.

510
00:32:55,948 --> 00:32:56,590
Scott: It's still round.

511
00:32:56,851 --> 00:32:58,618
Rym: Did you see the Mario Opera?

512
00:32:58,839 --> 00:33:01,630
Rym: Mario and Luigi will fuck you up if you get anywhere near them?

513
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:03,959
Scott: No, Mario is coming at you, right?

514
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:04,984
Scott: So you're way ahead of him.

515
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,993
Scott: You build a giant pit He can't cross.

516
00:33:07,375 --> 00:33:08,720
Scott: you run around the world.

517
00:33:08,961 --> 00:33:11,070
Scott: He's still heading towards your giant pit.

518
00:33:11,391 --> 00:33:13,176
Rym: What he sends Luigi in the other direction.

519
00:33:13,336 --> 00:33:14,760
Scott: Luigi can't go backwards.

520
00:33:15,262 --> 00:33:16,204
Scott: You can't go backwards.

521
00:33:16,806 --> 00:33:19,908
Rym: Maybe you can no Maybe no.

522
00:33:20,372 --> 00:33:23,866
Rym: Anyway, the thing I always hear people say is why don't you just send booze after him?

523
00:33:23,886 --> 00:33:27,102
Rym: cuz you can't kill booze Let's get a hammer exactly two booze at once right?

524
00:33:27,122 --> 00:33:27,866
Scott: He's trapped in the middle.

525
00:33:27,947 --> 00:33:28,530
Rym: the reason for that?

526
00:33:29,431 --> 00:33:30,619
Rym: Bowser can't control booze.

527
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:31,303
Rym: for crap all that.

528
00:33:31,323 --> 00:33:32,310
Rym: Bowser is afraid of booze.

529
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:34,746
Rym: That's the reason you only find scary stuff in those mansions.

530
00:33:34,787 --> 00:33:35,270
Scott: That's right.

531
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:36,875
Rym: But anyway, there was that.

532
00:33:36,895 --> 00:33:41,250
Scott: remember that flash video that was like all the Koopa underlings were like fuck you Bowser.

533
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:43,762
Scott: We're doing it our way and they freaking tear Mario a new hole.

534
00:33:43,822 --> 00:33:44,124
Scott: Yeah.

535
00:33:44,285 --> 00:33:45,048
Scott: Yeah, that was a good one.

536
00:33:45,129 --> 00:33:47,776
Scott: So Someone was saying hey, why doesn't dr.

537
00:33:47,816 --> 00:33:51,750
Scott: Wily just send all the robot masters at Mega Man all at once, right?

538
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:57,067
Rym: It makes sense because the doors holding them in can only be opened by jumping into them.

539
00:33:57,247 --> 00:33:59,354
Scott: Well, yes, that's true But you know the.

540
00:33:59,655 --> 00:34:01,643
Scott: why doesn't he send all the robot masters at once?

541
00:34:01,683 --> 00:34:03,630
Scott: then how would Mega Man possibly beat them, right?

542
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:04,172
Scott: It's like sure.

543
00:34:04,433 --> 00:34:12,784
Scott: he could try to like shoot the metal blades a whole bunch and bubble man might get axed but It's not gonna do much against you know, some of the other guys.

544
00:34:12,804 --> 00:34:14,210
Rym: Well, apparently we have the answer.

545
00:34:14,532 --> 00:34:16,708
Scott: Well, not only do we have the answer, right?

546
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:26,559
Scott: instead of doing a flash video with some stupid lame joke like that Mario flash video this guy actually Hacked the ROM so that you fight all.

547
00:34:26,619 --> 00:34:29,065
Scott: it's called Megaman - Rockman -.

548
00:34:29,145 --> 00:34:39,909
Scott: Netta a Japanese guy did it, of course and It's a ROM hack that lets you as Megaman in Megaman to fight every single robot master for Megaman - all at once.

549
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:41,337
Scott: They all appear all at once.

550
00:34:41,437 --> 00:34:42,442
Scott: you fight them all at once.

551
00:34:42,483 --> 00:34:43,949
Scott: you have all the weapons though, right?

552
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:47,166
Scott: Which is sort of like wrong because they're still alive.

553
00:34:47,206 --> 00:34:48,030
Scott: So how do you have their weapons?

554
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:52,274
Scott: I don't know, but you fight them all at once and The thing about it.

555
00:34:52,313 --> 00:34:53,157
Scott: That's pretty funny.

556
00:34:53,757 --> 00:34:53,998
Scott: Is that?

557
00:34:54,099 --> 00:34:55,443
Scott: it is actually beatable.

558
00:34:56,145 --> 00:34:58,010
Scott: It's like you think oh you would just die instantly.

559
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:02,269
Scott: It's like a. you know, fire would come at you quick boomerangs would come at you flash man would jump on you.

560
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:04,947
Rym: but no what happens is remember it's Megaman.

561
00:35:04,967 --> 00:35:13,839
Rym: and Especially if you play the Megaman X games one of the biggest strategies you'll use and a lot of things is you get hit by Something now you're invulnerable for a few seconds.

562
00:35:13,999 --> 00:35:17,170
Rym: Yeah, so you're basically invulnerable for the majority of this fight.

563
00:35:17,504 --> 00:35:25,909
Scott: Yeah because it's like you shoot but you like kill bubble man right with your metal blades and then you get hit and Then you're invincible long enough to like dole out a lot of damage.

564
00:35:26,413 --> 00:35:27,761
Scott: They're all in the same spot.

565
00:35:27,801 --> 00:35:29,129
Scott: you can sort of hit them all at once.

566
00:35:29,772 --> 00:35:35,071
Rym: so I just have to go through the list of all the different weapons that destroy the people and Spoilers.

567
00:35:35,472 --> 00:35:37,800
Rym: metal man totally gets punked by his own metal blades.

568
00:35:37,981 --> 00:35:38,623
Scott: Yeah, it's true.

569
00:35:38,904 --> 00:35:40,490
Rym: Well, I remember when I figured that out as a kid.

570
00:35:40,658 --> 00:35:47,502
Scott: Yeah so in this there's a little video here that shows you someone beating it and Also, you can get the ROM and try it yourself.

571
00:35:47,643 --> 00:35:58,269
Scott: Of course, you'll probably just die Pretty quickly if you try but if you're the master and maybe you watch the video closely Maybe you too can beat all the robot masters all at once.

572
00:35:59,951 --> 00:36:05,930
Rym: So to continue our discussion of fallout 3 since we both played a quite large bit of it.

573
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:09,850
Scott: Well, I played the whole fight and played the whole thing, but I beat it.

574
00:36:10,272 --> 00:36:11,096
Scott: I got to the ending.

575
00:36:11,117 --> 00:36:13,470
Scott: that did not go everywhere and do everything.

576
00:36:13,811 --> 00:36:17,729
Rym: I know the ending but I did not get to it yet because I've been going around doing everything.

577
00:36:18,111 --> 00:36:19,228
Scott: Well, what part were you at?

578
00:36:20,391 --> 00:36:24,888
Rym: The part I was at at the moment was I had gone and done the whole mr.

579
00:36:24,928 --> 00:36:25,490
Rym: Tenpenny thing.

580
00:36:25,671 --> 00:36:26,194
Rym: You didn't do that.

581
00:36:26,214 --> 00:36:29,190
Scott: Did you but I went up there eventually, but I didn't really do anything up there.

582
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:32,126
Scott: I just went up and I was like, oh, here's that place for him was talking about.

583
00:36:32,147 --> 00:36:32,750
Scott: All right, I'm leaving.

584
00:36:33,277 --> 00:36:34,190
Rym: I like that place a lot.

585
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:46,045
Rym: And even though I think I agree with Scott Johnson that these story there is bullshit Even though it teaches you a valuable lesson about not being a nice guy and not being tolerant Let me let me sum up my thoughts in this game, right?

586
00:36:46,105 --> 00:36:48,498
Scott: First of all fallout one and two.

587
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:52,750
Scott: I've tried to play those and I've never had success.

588
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:59,169
Scott: I tried to play them back in the day and I tried to play them recently and while playing them recently I had a slightly larger measure of success.

589
00:37:00,413 --> 00:37:00,837
Scott: It wasn't.

590
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:09,399
Scott: I was just too Frustrated with that crap to deal with it, you know, it's like a lot of people really like those games And they're like, oh, they're classics.

591
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,384
Scott: Oh, they're so great.

592
00:37:10,806 --> 00:37:13,056
Scott: They're not you know They don't.

593
00:37:13,096 --> 00:37:14,046
Scott: they don't do it for me.

594
00:37:14,167 --> 00:37:26,130
Scott: So Fallout 3 the only reason I was sort of giving it a chance was because it was like all FPS in and I sort of felt like actually Exploring the world, you know by walking around.

595
00:37:26,675 --> 00:37:28,190
Scott: That was what was gonna do it for me.

596
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:30,770
Rym: That was I mean that was the biggest plus for this game.

597
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:35,270
Rym: That was the reason I thought Scott might enjoy actually was that he played for the original fallout.

598
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:36,520
Rym: You know, everybody's yelp bugging him.

599
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:42,968
Rym: So he downloaded it He played it and the first thing I remember him saying was wait, so I can't just walk around the world.

600
00:37:42,988 --> 00:37:43,550
Rym: That's bullshit.

601
00:37:44,214 --> 00:37:47,090
Scott: Yeah, it's like I got a click on the town and then you click on another town.

602
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:52,308
Scott: You just sort of quickly teleport from one town to another but sometimes it's random encounters.

603
00:37:52,348 --> 00:37:57,710
Scott: in the middle It's like ah, well, I guess it's better, you know, at least in Final Fantasy, right?

604
00:37:57,790 --> 00:38:18,930
Scott: There might be random encounters as you walk from here to there but you're having the fun of exploring a map and picking up treasure chests and you sort of seeing things for yourself in this game, it's like But and there's a lot more, you know in the older fallout It was a lot more RPG grinding, you know, cuz he's like click on the rat click on the rat again.

605
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:24,030
Scott: It was like slow Diablo really, you know, and that sort of was annoying.

606
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,401
Rym: Yeah That's one thing that I was a little disappointed.

607
00:38:26,421 --> 00:38:33,210
Rym: the FPS thing of this game Mattered a lot less than I mean, I didn't expect it to matter much, but it didn't matter at all.

608
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,910
Rym: It was basically just turn-based combat.

609
00:38:36,566 --> 00:38:38,054
Scott: Yeah Yeah, that that did annoy me.

610
00:38:38,094 --> 00:38:40,903
Scott: cuz like if I'm I felt like I was as FPS.

611
00:38:40,923 --> 00:38:43,210
Scott: he controls like an FPS, right?

612
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:51,310
Scott: But like there's a difference between cone fire and you know, I mean Counter-Strike has cone fire Your bullet is going to be in this area, right?

613
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:57,093
Scott: This game basically aiming at someone's head and clicking on their head It would.

614
00:38:57,213 --> 00:39:02,110
Scott: the game would then do the RPG calculation saying, okay, you're using small arms.

615
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:05,270
Scott: Your small arm skill is this he's this far away.

616
00:39:05,892 --> 00:39:10,310
Scott: So the percent chance of you hitting his head is this let's roll the dice.

617
00:39:10,731 --> 00:39:16,030
Scott: You did not hit and then after it did all that the bullet would fly off into the middle of nowhere, right?

618
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:26,590
Scott: There are instances where I was Crouching and aim perfectly at someone's head who wasn't paying attention With a missile and like it would just like fly right past him like way off into the sky.

619
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:28,019
Scott: He's just like what the fuck.

620
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,610
Scott: my aim doesn't matter for shit.

621
00:39:30,116 --> 00:39:31,249
Rym: But I guess I mean for me.

622
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:38,470
Rym: I enjoyed the game a lot because of the exploration at first like when I first walked out of that vault and Start and realize I go in any direction.

623
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:43,370
Rym: I see that elevated highway going off in the distance and the first thing I thought was hot shit.

624
00:39:43,491 --> 00:39:45,581
Rym: I got to get up there and walk along that thing.

625
00:39:45,903 --> 00:39:46,425
Rym: I look to the right.

626
00:39:46,445 --> 00:39:47,350
Rym: I see this big tower.

627
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:49,310
Rym: I'm like, oh man, I'm totally gonna check that out.

628
00:39:50,171 --> 00:40:03,458
Rym: But I guess what disappointed me was it wasn't as bad as games like Oblivion in that there was a lot of stuff to do But the majority the vast majority of anything any feature on the train anywhere out there was 100% non interactive.

629
00:40:05,372 --> 00:40:06,559
Scott: Yeah that you know.

630
00:40:06,619 --> 00:40:08,290
Rym: and I spent an hour exploring.

631
00:40:09,053 --> 00:40:18,910
Rym: I didn't explore anything really for the rest of the game except for plot stuff because it was all Like other unless I found a computer that told me something or a person that told me something or an item that did something.

632
00:40:19,594 --> 00:40:21,990
Rym: The world itself was just cookie cutter all over the place.

633
00:40:22,692 --> 00:40:32,090
Scott: I think that's the one major problem I have with the game other than all the RPG bullshit You know, basically the thing is the game has lots of RPG bullshit, which I hate right?

634
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:39,510
Scott: but the thing is Mostly ignore all that and the explore e part of the game sort of makes up for it.

635
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:41,089
Scott: Now the thing that bothers me, right?

636
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:47,050
Scott: I think the one way the game could really improve the most is that you have this big world, right?

637
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:51,057
Scott: but the world really is Static.

638
00:40:51,158 --> 00:40:52,289
Scott: it doesn't change.

639
00:40:52,774 --> 00:40:58,503
Scott: it is as it is and the only way the world can change is if you change it.

640
00:40:58,583 --> 00:41:07,445
Scott: and you literally all you do in this game is go to different parts of the world and Decide how and if you are going to change that part of the world.

641
00:41:07,485 --> 00:41:14,270
Scott: and sometimes, you know You don't actually know what the result will be of your actions in terms of changing the world.

642
00:41:14,792 --> 00:41:18,690
Scott: But you're making a decision, you know change the world for the better or the worse.

643
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:21,100
Scott: You know, what action are you going to take now?

644
00:41:21,522 --> 00:41:24,376
Scott: and the world is non living.

645
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:30,534
Scott: it's like Other characters in the world are not making decisions and changing the world in any way Like I can go to.

646
00:41:30,575 --> 00:41:32,970
Scott: it's like a I can go into like a random cave, right?

647
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:36,610
Scott: It can be full of bad guys, but they're not right in this spot at the moment, right?

648
00:41:37,131 --> 00:41:52,943
Scott: I could take all my goodies like a whole pile of bottle caps a thousand bottle caps and put them in an unlocked locker And come back to the game like literally like I can just say wait in game time and like wait weeks and weeks and weeks And travel around the whole game world and come back.

649
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:55,955
Scott: It'll be in that locker Because there's the game.

650
00:41:56,116 --> 00:41:58,205
Scott: There's no characters exploring things like me.

651
00:41:58,245 --> 00:41:59,290
Scott: There's no one doing anything.

652
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:08,750
Rym: well, I have two things to say to that but first I would like to Remind you about a game that came out a long freaking time ago the Blade Runner game for the PC.

653
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:09,634
Rym: Do you remember that game?

654
00:42:09,654 --> 00:42:12,470
Scott: I remember the trailer for it because it's on a CD for another game.

655
00:42:13,132 --> 00:42:15,298
Rym: But you don't remember the game because the game schtick.

656
00:42:15,318 --> 00:42:20,554
Rym: the big deal about the game was that the plot was Determined.

657
00:42:20,574 --> 00:42:24,170
Rym: when you start like the what the truths about the game world?

658
00:42:24,591 --> 00:42:29,950
Rym: We're not static and you might or might not be a replicant and other people may or may not be replicants.

659
00:42:30,211 --> 00:42:30,552
Scott: I'm in.

660
00:42:31,034 --> 00:42:31,878
Rym: so that's the first thing.

661
00:42:31,898 --> 00:42:34,690
Rym: so the game theoretically would have near infinite replayability.

662
00:42:35,402 --> 00:42:35,626
Rym: but to.

663
00:42:36,691 --> 00:42:48,630
Rym: The game was played in real time and while you were walking around and talking to people and doing stuff the other Protagonist or antagonist the other active characters were also doing stuff.

664
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:56,657
Rym: So if you find out that so-and-so is gonna meet so-and-so in the alley at night and you go there They're gonna be there.

665
00:42:57,502 --> 00:43:00,782
Rym: or if you don't go there They're gonna be there and conduct their business.

666
00:43:00,883 --> 00:43:01,950
Rym: and now that changes the world.

667
00:43:02,231 --> 00:43:12,310
Scott: I mean some of the stuff in the game is time sensitive, but it's like it doesn't matter what day it is Like this day and this night and some stuff is at night and some stuff is a day.

668
00:43:12,391 --> 00:43:13,369
Scott: But other than that it no.

669
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:21,277
Rym: But this was more like if you go to the person's house when there's before they go out to meet the guy You'll meet them like outside of the place.

670
00:43:21,317 --> 00:43:25,270
Rym: They were at like they go through the game world in real time.

671
00:43:25,331 --> 00:43:26,789
Rym: It's tracking what everyone's doing.

672
00:43:27,251 --> 00:43:37,310
Rym: So your goals are constantly fluid and it was a really really really ambitious game and a lot of those mechanics I don't think are really possible yet on a real scale.

673
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:37,653
Rym: The game was.

674
00:43:37,673 --> 00:43:41,799
Rym: there is a way that game was ass But that was just because of the limitations of the tech.

675
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:43,385
Scott: there is a way that that's possible.

676
00:43:43,445 --> 00:43:44,630
Scott: It's called multiplayer.

677
00:43:45,032 --> 00:43:45,474
Rym: No, you know what?

678
00:43:45,494 --> 00:43:46,056
Rym: It's called.

679
00:43:46,377 --> 00:43:49,290
Rym: It's called a massively multiplayer online role-playing game.

680
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:52,126
Rym: The problem is what we know an MMO to be.

681
00:43:52,166 --> 00:43:52,589
Rym: is not that?

682
00:43:52,629 --> 00:44:07,353
Rym: in fact There was just that article on slashdot talking about like server optimization for MMOs and they made a really really telling point That I think they said something like 95 percent to 90 like the vast majority of Player.

683
00:44:07,514 --> 00:44:12,714
Rym: interaction with the game world in World of Warcraft for example is a hundred percent parallel.

684
00:44:13,174 --> 00:44:19,640
Rym: very few people are interacting with very few other people at any given time and While the game has a lot of people in it.

685
00:44:20,404 --> 00:44:24,039
Rym: There's no actual Massively multiplayer part going on.

686
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,830
Rym: No P. It isn't really massively interactive.

687
00:44:27,192 --> 00:44:30,990
Rym: It's just a lot of players playing much smaller games next to each other.

688
00:44:31,551 --> 00:44:38,774
Scott: I think something else right that sort of differentiates at least a fallout MMO compared to say a World of Warcraft MMO.

689
00:44:38,955 --> 00:44:46,830
Scott: right would be that in Fallout Player the the player right modifies at least the game world, right?

690
00:44:47,311 --> 00:44:55,930
Scott: So if you at least had a fallout MMO It would be a little bit better than a Warcraft World of Warcraft because in World of Warcraft the world is static, right?

691
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:58,458
Scott: We all beat the same boss over and over again, right?

692
00:44:58,859 --> 00:45:02,510
Scott: Everyone beats the boss hundreds and hundreds of times and fallout.

693
00:45:03,132 --> 00:45:05,059
Scott: So there's a big monster somewhere in a cave.

694
00:45:05,099 --> 00:45:10,116
Scott: Let's say right someone goes and kills the monster in the cave Someone else shows up.

695
00:45:10,377 --> 00:45:13,810
Scott: There's a dead monster in the cave and all the loot is gone.

696
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:14,251
Rym: It's got.

697
00:45:14,271 --> 00:45:18,506
Rym: people have been putting forth that idea since the beginning of MMOs and even since mods.

698
00:45:18,546 --> 00:45:28,709
Rym: the problem is It doesn't scale well and the cost of creating that much content is so prohibitive compared to that's why the content has to be The other players, right?

699
00:45:30,271 --> 00:45:33,100
Rym: Somebody that is the fundamental problem.

700
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:42,128
Rym: if you make an MMO like that remember the rule like 95% of people will consume 4% will interact and 1% will contribute.

701
00:45:42,369 --> 00:45:42,510
Scott: man.

702
00:45:42,551 --> 00:45:44,936
Scott: If there was an MMO like that I could I would like sign in.

703
00:45:44,976 --> 00:45:49,660
Scott: I'd be like I want to be the cave troll today and I'd go and I'd find a bridge And I'd be like, I'm the cave troll.

704
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:51,550
Scott: I'm gonna harass anyone that comes over this bridge.

705
00:45:51,871 --> 00:45:58,118
Scott: So I'm like, I'm sort of just deciding like a role for myself and I could you know That's you know, someone else logs in like today.

706
00:45:58,138 --> 00:46:00,207
Scott: I'm gonna be the king like I'm the king today.

707
00:46:00,227 --> 00:46:00,970
Scott: They'll be all kingly.

708
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:10,090
Rym: I think one way to do that would be if you had us a large set of NPCs that were NPCs all the time unless a player took charge of them or another way.

709
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:10,531
Scott: That was it.

710
00:46:11,073 --> 00:46:25,088
Rym: another way would be if you had a world that was still massively parallelized like World of Warcraft But it was parallelized into discrete game worlds or discrete game areas that themselves were a hundred percent.

711
00:46:25,289 --> 00:46:35,510
Rym: either player created emergent content or World, you know were in world changed in the context of the world irrevocably by players content.

712
00:46:36,011 --> 00:46:46,501
Rym: So 50 different groups of a hundred people each could all play the same World of Warcraft storyline world through But each one the events are a hundred percent can.

713
00:46:47,123 --> 00:46:49,690
Rym: nothing is done except by the drive of players themselves.

714
00:46:50,611 --> 00:46:55,790
Rym: But all those things don't make a lot of money compared to a game like wow, so that we're not there yet?

715
00:46:55,970 --> 00:46:57,877
Scott: No, so then I also want to talk about right.

716
00:46:57,897 --> 00:47:01,650
Scott: whenever people talk about Fallout they talk about oh you can do anything, right?

717
00:47:01,670 --> 00:47:02,274
Scott: It's so great.

718
00:47:02,334 --> 00:47:04,730
Scott: It's like you can just go in there and kill everyone.

719
00:47:04,810 --> 00:47:05,513
Scott: You don't have to.

720
00:47:05,774 --> 00:47:07,642
Scott: you know, go like on the railroads.

721
00:47:07,662 --> 00:47:09,510
Scott: that compared to say Final Fantasy, right?

722
00:47:09,972 --> 00:47:13,630
Scott: And compared to Final Fantasy that is true right Final Fantasy.

723
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:16,079
Scott: This is the story we deliver you the story.

724
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,327
Scott: you just get through it in Fallout.

725
00:47:18,367 --> 00:47:22,799
Scott: You do have Choices, right, but you can't do anything.

726
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:25,004
Scott: That is that is BS, right?

727
00:47:25,526 --> 00:47:32,988
Scott: I mean there the choices are Sometimes interesting sometimes not interesting, but there is always choice, right?

728
00:47:33,048 --> 00:47:41,086
Scott: For example There was a mission with like a tree I had to deal with right and I could kill the tree nicely like it wanted me to.

729
00:47:41,106 --> 00:47:42,250
Scott: I could kill it painfully.

730
00:47:43,131 --> 00:47:46,688
Scott: There was an old lady who wanted me to like rub something on the tree instead of killing it.

731
00:47:48,432 --> 00:47:52,829
Scott: There was an old man who wanted me to rub something different on the tree instead of killing it, right?

732
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:53,372
Scott: it's like.

733
00:47:53,392 --> 00:48:00,466
Scott: I know I had these choices, but There really weren't any Choices that weren't scripted by the game.

734
00:48:01,351 --> 00:48:04,390
Scott: It's like, you know, like killing things is always an option.

735
00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:16,513
Scott: So the game sort of always has a way of dealing with that because you have weapons but you don't really have any way to interact with the world besides shooting things or dialogue, so Really?

736
00:48:16,534 --> 00:48:29,160
Scott: The game is just a scripted like tree of events Not this sort of unscripted freeform thing because all your options are defined by the dialogue choices Or by shooting things.

737
00:48:29,582 --> 00:48:33,117
Scott: is what other way, you know I guess there's hacking and lock picking.

738
00:48:33,178 --> 00:48:37,090
Scott: sometimes can like or science can sometimes let you do something differently.

739
00:48:37,874 --> 00:48:40,550
Scott: But those are also defined tracks.

740
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:43,310
Rym: So those really they're no different than you know.

741
00:48:43,330 --> 00:48:57,495
Rym: the old quest for glory games where you have the same game world you can play as a fighter a thief a mage or a Paladin and depending on which one you choose and what skills you have There is a. there are four different ways to solve every possible problem in the game And they're also.

742
00:48:58,037 --> 00:49:05,929
Rym: each class has a subset of things they can get at or do that are cool That no one else can get at because they don't have the relevant skills or abilities or anything like that.

743
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:08,917
Rym: So it kind of creates replayability.

744
00:49:08,957 --> 00:49:13,790
Rym: but fallout doesn't add anything to that like fallout just reimplements that old game mechanic.

745
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:15,335
Rym: That's been largely forgotten.

746
00:49:15,515 --> 00:49:18,143
Scott: Yeah, it's not a do anything you want game.

747
00:49:18,324 --> 00:49:24,190
Scott: It's just a game that makes you feel More free because there are multiple choices.

748
00:49:24,411 --> 00:49:29,470
Scott: There are multiple pat different paths to the same end and there are multiple different ends.

749
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:30,251
Scott: You can choose.

750
00:49:30,311 --> 00:49:35,118
Scott: but the thing is most of the choices are sort of inconsequential.

751
00:49:35,198 --> 00:49:46,908
Scott: All they do is sort of modify a small area of the game world or change a few statistics or change what items you're gonna get or change something sort of Small and insignificant B?

752
00:49:47,171 --> 00:49:48,450
Rym: Well, that was what Yahtzee kept saying.

753
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:49,634
Scott: There's the end of the game.

754
00:49:49,895 --> 00:49:57,010
Scott: only like two or three choices you make actually change the ending and the ending is a small video That you can watch all the different ones on YouTube.

755
00:49:57,110 --> 00:49:58,376
Scott: So who cares which one you get?

756
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:00,627
Rym: but like Yahtzee was pointing out and I tend to agree.

757
00:50:00,667 --> 00:50:08,429
Rym: There's no Permanence or feeling that you're accomplishing anything because almost everything you do in the game Like you said changes a small part of the world.

758
00:50:08,811 --> 00:50:12,000
Rym: so like this area either has trees or doesn't or whatever.

759
00:50:12,441 --> 00:50:21,430
Rym: or these people these slaves are either free or they're not or The ghouls or the people in Tenpenny's Tower, but you know little things like that and the radio will say like oh, he's the same.

760
00:50:22,332 --> 00:50:32,430
Scott: They're really good at doing a lot of Atmospheric things and sort of things that make you go like hey cool It's sort of the same thing you get when you like get superhero comic books, right?

761
00:50:32,731 --> 00:50:37,594
Scott: It's like you read a superhero comic book or say spider-man beats up I don't know the lizard.

762
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:39,742
Scott: right lizard man, right the guy with the lab coat.

763
00:50:40,364 --> 00:50:50,178
Scott: and then you're reading say I don't know daredevil right and in the newspaper and daredevil you see like the Picture of the spider-man beating up the lizard.

764
00:50:50,259 --> 00:50:53,190
Scott: and because you read the spider-man comic you're like, oh cool, right?

765
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:54,947
Rym: This has been going back for a long time.

766
00:50:54,967 --> 00:50:58,159
Rym: Scott Paperboy calls it quits exactly.

767
00:50:58,199 --> 00:51:00,690
Scott: It's the same thing in Fallout 3, right?

768
00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:05,450
Scott: I said there was this kid early in the game and his parents got killed by nasty fire ants.

769
00:51:05,932 --> 00:51:08,101
Scott: So I rescued him and found him a new home.

770
00:51:08,121 --> 00:51:11,981
Scott: and then the radio guy was like Isn't the guy from vault 101?

771
00:51:11,981 --> 00:51:12,222
Scott: great.

772
00:51:12,262 --> 00:51:13,510
Scott: he found this kid a new home.

773
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:18,294
Scott: He's the best and it's like hey cool, but it doesn't really change Anything.

774
00:51:18,315 --> 00:51:19,382
Rym: like I was saying what I mean.

775
00:51:19,402 --> 00:51:20,610
Scott: I can go to the kid.

776
00:51:20,851 --> 00:51:24,430
Scott: It's like now the kid is in his new home instead of being in his old home.

777
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:29,464
Rym: But it doesn't matter really like I was saying as Yahtzee also pointed out.

778
00:51:29,484 --> 00:51:30,888
Rym: There's no sense of permanence.

779
00:51:30,948 --> 00:51:32,354
Rym: or change you.

780
00:51:32,777 --> 00:51:38,249
Rym: what you get when you defeat these quests really is Some more bottle caps and ammo and maybe a new weapon.

781
00:51:38,734 --> 00:51:40,549
Rym: Yep, and that gets real quick.

782
00:51:40,711 --> 00:51:45,830
Scott: There really aren't a lot of different weapons And you don't have enough skill points to be good with all of them.

783
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:49,222
Scott: And it's like if you're not good with the weapon why have it you know?

784
00:51:49,303 --> 00:51:51,290
Scott: and it just more bottle caps.

785
00:51:51,350 --> 00:51:52,214
Scott: It's like all right listen.

786
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:54,545
Scott: I've got a missile launcher and like 50 missiles.

787
00:51:54,946 --> 00:51:55,730
Scott: I've got a minigun.

788
00:51:56,631 --> 00:51:59,719
Scott: I've got laser rifles and plasma rifles and gatling lasers.

789
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,483
Scott: really I don't need.

790
00:52:01,503 --> 00:52:04,230
Scott: I can already hose anything down.

791
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:08,062
Scott: Nothing can stop me anything that I have a mini nukes.

792
00:52:08,624 --> 00:52:09,868
Scott: I only used one mini nuke.

793
00:52:09,909 --> 00:52:10,310
Scott: the whole game.

794
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:12,018
Scott: I had like four right.

795
00:52:12,259 --> 00:52:13,404
Scott: there was nothing to use them on.

796
00:52:13,424 --> 00:52:16,898
Scott: there was actually one cool part Where there's a gigantic gigantic super mutant.

797
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:20,330
Scott: why didn't they throw something and that was not even near the end of the game?

798
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:25,810
Scott: They should have thrown something even bigger at me towards the end of the game.

799
00:52:26,171 --> 00:52:30,166
Scott: Yeah, instead there's something really big on your side at the end of the game.

800
00:52:30,186 --> 00:52:31,130
Scott: Which is way cool.

801
00:52:32,091 --> 00:52:34,239
Scott: But I'd rather would have had a bigger opponent.

802
00:52:34,782 --> 00:52:41,110
Rym: yeah, I guess it's just that the the story Doesn't grab me that much because the interaction isn't enough.

803
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:49,050
Rym: I mean the story of the Fallout world is great and a lot of the things you do in this game are really cool ideas But they don't grab me enough because I don't have enough interaction.

804
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:51,137
Rym: We might be asking too much of games like this.

805
00:52:51,157 --> 00:52:57,139
Rym: the technology just might not be there yet to make them in a cost-effective manner To where they could actually make money off of a game.

806
00:52:58,164 --> 00:52:58,545
Rym: I don't know.

807
00:52:58,566 --> 00:53:07,281
Scott: yeah The game I mean I did play the game the whole way through despite not liking Fallout 1 & 2 and I really liked exploring the world.

808
00:53:07,743 --> 00:53:13,670
Scott: even though like the little side quests were like Inconsequential I still sort of enjoyed like exploring them.

809
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:18,150
Scott: They were almost like little games in and of themselves and some of them were better than others.

810
00:53:18,210 --> 00:53:25,553
Scott: You know some of them I cared more about than others, but like if I didn't care about one I could just leave it you know or Like.

811
00:53:25,875 --> 00:53:29,590
Scott: I could just sort of you know go and just kill people if I felt like it.

812
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:33,590
Scott: You know it's sort of a little cathartic FPS thing even though it wasn't FPS thing.

813
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:39,247
Scott: I tried to FPS and not use the stupid auto-aim thing is my pretty much never use those things.

814
00:53:39,689 --> 00:53:43,217
Scott: yeah You know I mean some of that.

815
00:53:43,257 --> 00:53:43,659
Scott: they were like.

816
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:47,841
Scott: you know the game had lots of sort of art in it That was worth enjoying like this.

817
00:53:47,901 --> 00:53:54,210
Scott: good music on the radio There's you know really good sort of short stories to experience.

818
00:53:54,310 --> 00:53:54,672
Scott: I sort of.

819
00:53:54,973 --> 00:54:03,594
Scott: that's the way I sort of viewed the game, and why it was worth playing despite the mechanics of it not being too exciting or Leveling up.

820
00:54:03,675 --> 00:54:05,989
Rym: choose your own adventure book with really good art.

821
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:07,173
Scott: Yeah, it's like this.

822
00:54:07,273 --> 00:54:14,439
Scott: you know good things to look at good stories to be told good things to hear well funny jokes.

823
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:17,854
Rym: at the time the voice acting was Hit or miss.

824
00:54:17,894 --> 00:54:21,809
Rym: it was really good in some parts and like abominable in others.

825
00:54:21,829 --> 00:54:23,948
Scott: well Yeah, it was but you know it.

826
00:54:25,072 --> 00:54:27,302
Scott: I mostly didn't pay attention to voice acting a lot of times.

827
00:54:27,343 --> 00:54:28,830
Scott: Just sort of skipped and read the text.

828
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:40,186
Scott: I think the what another area the game should have improved was that sort of You I did sort of I guess things out of order and then things happen that don't make sense.

829
00:54:40,647 --> 00:54:53,430
Scott: you know for example There's like a mission go to galaxy news radio to find out what happened to your dad right, so I'm like okay So I can't figure out how to get there right, so I'm trying to get there.

830
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:54,538
Scott: I can't make it right.

831
00:54:54,579 --> 00:54:55,909
Scott: It's really dangerous over there.

832
00:54:56,552 --> 00:55:00,770
Scott: So I've got like three other missions to do and they all say go to Rivet town.

833
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:02,521
Scott: So I'm like you know what I'm fucking going to Rivet town.

834
00:55:03,125 --> 00:55:03,668
Scott: I go there.

835
00:55:04,391 --> 00:55:07,301
Scott: Suddenly that whole galaxy news radio thing like disappears.

836
00:55:07,802 --> 00:55:09,427
Scott: and now because I went to Rivet town.

837
00:55:09,447 --> 00:55:10,330
Scott: I must have jumped ahead.

838
00:55:10,471 --> 00:55:13,522
Scott: I must assume that if I would have gone to galaxy news radio.

839
00:55:13,542 --> 00:55:21,930
Scott: They would have told me to go to Rivet town also and There's a scientist lady, and I'm talking to her and all the dialogue options.

840
00:55:22,332 --> 00:55:24,701
Scott: It's like I can sort of figure it out because I'm smart.

841
00:55:24,841 --> 00:55:26,990
Scott: right now any human could sort of figure it out.

842
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:28,916
Scott: You know what they missed like.

843
00:55:29,337 --> 00:55:30,601
Scott: oh, I guess I skipped over this.

844
00:55:30,621 --> 00:55:36,453
Scott: you know your mind can fill in the blanks because you know What's going on, but it's still Discontiguous.

845
00:55:36,473 --> 00:55:39,523
Scott: suddenly I'm talking to this person like I know them.

846
00:55:39,844 --> 00:55:43,070
Scott: like I know that I was looking for them even though I've never heard of them before.

847
00:55:43,830 --> 00:55:50,450
Scott: Right and even though I can put it together in my mind because I have this you know ability to recognize things.

848
00:55:51,070 --> 00:55:57,876
Scott: It's way choppy, and if like you did that in like a movie people would be way confused Like I.

849
00:55:57,936 --> 00:56:06,670
Rym: like that time we watched a certain unnamed movie But because of the DVD we skipped the first like 15 minutes of the movie, so it didn't make any sense exactly.

850
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:16,145
Rym: Exactly, I remember watching the first half of the movie at the end going oh Okay, yeah It's exactly like that.

851
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:21,100
Scott: so I mean I guess I feel like the game should have been like is another example.

852
00:56:21,241 --> 00:56:26,003
Scott: Right though in the beginning early in the game as a sheriff right as a guy in town Who's bad?

853
00:56:26,023 --> 00:56:27,651
Scott: so you tell the sheriff about the bad guy.

854
00:56:27,953 --> 00:56:29,380
Scott: the sheriff goes take care of the bad guy?

855
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:36,666
Scott: But then the bad guy shoots the sheriff down, so then you shoot the bad guy down all right Later like I just like okay.

856
00:56:36,867 --> 00:56:37,870
Scott: I guess that's over with.

857
00:56:38,372 --> 00:56:44,953
Scott: so I leave and I come back like a few days later And like the sheriff's kid is talking to me, but the dialogue.

858
00:56:44,973 --> 00:56:46,880
Scott: He's talking to me as if he knows me.

859
00:56:47,402 --> 00:56:48,568
Scott: I've never met him before.

860
00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:50,840
Scott: I never didn't even know the sheriff had a kid.

861
00:56:51,663 --> 00:56:57,571
Scott: I guess I was supposed to meet him earlier and missed him, so it's way It's very startling.

862
00:56:57,611 --> 00:57:00,365
Scott: it takes you way out of it You know and stuff like that happens.

863
00:57:00,405 --> 00:57:00,907
Scott: they need to.

864
00:57:01,348 --> 00:57:07,810
Scott: the game should have sort of known that I hadn't met the sheriff's kid yet And thus the dialogue should have been like hey.

865
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:08,693
Scott: I'm the sheriff's kid.

866
00:57:08,713 --> 00:57:10,800
Scott: You didn't meet me before you know?

867
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,345
Scott: Thanks for help.

868
00:57:12,485 --> 00:57:17,320
Scott: You know killing the guy who killed my dad instead of you know yeah, now the dad's gone.

869
00:57:17,481 --> 00:57:18,223
Scott: How are you doing?

870
00:57:18,243 --> 00:57:19,708
Scott: It's like what I don't even know you well.

871
00:57:19,889 --> 00:57:24,243
Rym: at the same time are we asking too much of this genre yet, you know if you're?

872
00:57:24,263 --> 00:57:28,014
Scott: if you're you know it, I don't ask you know.

873
00:57:28,034 --> 00:57:41,900
Scott: I guess I Ask what for people to achieve what they aimed at and the game was definitely Aiming for that and fell short of what they themselves aimed for but not by that much not by that much.

874
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:47,940
Scott: But I mean you know it's like I expect people to achieve what they expected themselves to achieve.

875
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:49,588
Rym: You know maybe this is what they expected.

876
00:57:49,628 --> 00:57:51,518
Rym: I mean the game made money as far as I can tell.

877
00:57:51,538 --> 00:57:52,662
Scott: yeah Definitely mate.

878
00:57:52,743 --> 00:57:52,943
Scott: It was.

879
00:57:52,963 --> 00:57:54,067
Scott: it was a good deal for them.

880
00:57:54,087 --> 00:57:57,198
Scott: No doubt, but you know I mean it's cuz.

881
00:57:57,238 --> 00:57:57,780
Scott: I mean it's like hard.

882
00:57:57,881 --> 00:58:00,600
Scott: I mean someone makes like you know a Tetris clone.

883
00:58:01,223 --> 00:58:04,918
Scott: You're a Tetris clone isn't a flow isn't a freeform MMO world.

884
00:58:04,938 --> 00:58:05,259
Scott: you suck.

885
00:58:05,822 --> 00:58:09,439
Scott: It's like well now that they they set out to make Tetris and they made Tetris.

886
00:58:09,499 --> 00:58:13,716
Scott: well They set out to make a game where you know you have this sort of.

887
00:58:13,956 --> 00:58:20,620
Scott: you know free Decision-making going on and there were parts that they did not make it all the way, and it was a little choppy.

888
00:58:22,005 --> 00:58:22,371
Scott: There you go.

889
00:58:23,904 --> 00:58:25,380
Rym: So can we say anything else about fallout?

890
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:26,865
Rym: I mean we could go through all.

891
00:58:27,166 --> 00:58:30,500
Rym: it was awesome when such-and-such happened, and so it's not necessary.

892
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:32,138
Scott: There's plenty of those.

893
00:58:33,521 --> 00:58:35,251

894
00:58:35,371 --> 00:58:36,779
Scott: You know I don't know.

895
00:58:37,981 --> 00:58:39,025
Scott: All right, I think the game.

896
00:58:39,125 --> 00:59:00,500
Scott: I think the biggest thing is that the that I have left to say is that the game Only has artificial replay value you know and that if you play it again You can like be a hacker instead of a. you know solve your problems with the computers instead of with the guns or solve it With lock picking instead of computers or something like that, but I have no desire to play it again.

897
00:59:01,682 --> 00:59:02,930
Scott: That none whatsoever.

898
00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:04,539
Scott: It's it's you know.

899
00:59:05,401 --> 00:59:08,491
Scott: But if it was a true, you know what a fully free thing.

Scott: I'd probably play it forever.

00:59:10,036 --> 00:59:10,738
Rym: I guess it was just.

902
00:59:10,778 --> 00:59:15,260
Rym: it was more Oblivion II than I expected and that's just kind of a big turn.

903
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,931
Scott: I don't know what this you know this oblivion game you keep talking about.
