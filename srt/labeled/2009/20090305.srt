1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,364
Rym: It's Thursday March 5th.

2
00:00:11,605 --> 00:00:12,146
Scott: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,226 --> 00:00:14,512
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:14,532 --> 00:00:17,520
Rym: the laser tag the airsoft the paintball.

5
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:31,845
Scott: Let's do this Stupid economy.

6
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:36,707
Rym: I got this letter, you know, I don't really check my mail but I got this letter from Geico cuz.

7
00:00:36,727 --> 00:00:41,912
Rym: I have a Geico credit card because they give me like a ton off my car insurance and Back when I used to drive a lot.

8
00:00:41,932 --> 00:00:42,819
Rym: I got three percent off gas.

9
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:49,060
Scott: I mean, you know all credit cards that don't have some sort of annual fee, you know are relatively equal.

10
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,380
Scott: You know because we're not stupid where we're carrying a balance and you're only gonna carry a balance of in an emergency.

11
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,030
Scott: And in that case, do you really care what the interest rate is?

12
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:58,776
Scott: I mean, no one's gonna give you a 99% industry.

13
00:00:59,821 --> 00:01:02,620
Scott: It's always gonna be some reasonable or relatively reasonable number.

14
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:08,040
Rym: Well, yeah, unless you get a quote unquote credit card from well Joe Joe down on the car, of course.

15
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,720
Scott: But the vast majority of credit cards are relatively equal.

16
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,750
Scott: So in most sit in the vast majority of situations.

17
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:19,369
Scott: this thing that separates them from one another is first of all Is it visa American Express or MasterCard?

18
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:22,160
Scott: or discover because that determines where it will be accepted.

19
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,667
Rym: I'm gonna lecture on credit cards there.

20
00:01:23,868 --> 00:01:26,320
Scott: Well, no, I don't know but the other thing is the rewards.

21
00:01:26,621 --> 00:01:32,340
Scott: So you chose the Geico credit card because they gave you huge rewards because auto insurance is a pretty big expense.

22
00:01:32,461 --> 00:01:34,760
Scott: Well using that card except that saves you a lot of money.

23
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:42,710
Rym: My auto insurance has been for a while like $20 a month because I drive What what is apparently junk barely classified as a car?

24
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,220
Rym: what what I would have called in my younger days in Michigan a beater?

25
00:01:46,421 --> 00:01:48,127
Scott: Yeah, I'm about to pay off my car.

26
00:01:48,147 --> 00:01:52,444
Scott: So then I will own it fully and then I will decrease the insurance and get a higher Deductible.

27
00:01:52,464 --> 00:01:52,726
Rym: Yep.

28
00:01:52,766 --> 00:01:54,215
Scott: Yep, and it will be much better.

29
00:01:54,235 --> 00:01:59,072
Rym: I have like a $5,000 deductible on a car that's worth about five hundred dollars.

30
00:01:59,153 --> 00:02:01,560
Scott: I've got a $500 deductible, which sucks.

31
00:02:01,641 --> 00:02:08,538
Scott: I'd much rather have a one or two thousand dollar deductible But the owner of the car or part owner of the car will not let me.

32
00:02:08,558 --> 00:02:13,475
Scott: Wow I need to buy the car from them into to to change the deductible.

33
00:02:13,936 --> 00:02:18,320
Rym: Yeah, but anyway, you know I use this credit card, even though like I don't drive that much anymore.

34
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:24,820
Rym: So the benefits weren't so great, but whatever it had a high limit and they reduced my limit by an order of magnitude.

35
00:02:25,702 --> 00:02:25,903
Rym: Huh.

36
00:02:26,124 --> 00:02:34,739
Rym: and they sent this email basically saying hey We're lowering every single Geico credit card person's limit down to some piddly amount.

37
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:35,461
Rym: It's like $1,400.

38
00:02:35,461 --> 00:02:41,600
Scott: Whoa, even if you had a big limit before they said that they're doing it across the board.

39
00:02:42,082 --> 00:02:43,006
Rym: They have they're not.

40
00:02:43,026 --> 00:02:44,472
Rym: they didn't even check anyone's credit.

41
00:02:44,512 --> 00:02:50,960
Rym: They just dropped everyone across the board and I gotta get a new credit card now because I spend more than that every month.

42
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,424
Rym: So, you know, I can't I mean use my credit card I've got.

43
00:02:54,565 --> 00:02:56,918
Scott: I've got a visa which is the Sony card from.

44
00:02:56,999 --> 00:02:58,829
Scott: you know Which is the first credit card ever got.

45
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,900
Scott: and I recently got an American Express.

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,379
Scott: That's a cash back thingy and that's you know, pretty much, you know, it's the you can't get.

47
00:03:05,399 --> 00:03:11,240
Scott: I mean I could get a gold or platinum or whatever American Express, but they all have annual fees big ones.

48
00:03:11,342 --> 00:03:12,099
Scott: It's a big scam.

49
00:03:12,561 --> 00:03:19,204
Scott: so I stick with the one that just gives me cash back right and I basically use the American Express for everything except for places that don't accept it.

50
00:03:19,425 --> 00:03:26,330
Scott: and then I have visa which everyone fucking accepts and that you know, They both have limits of like three to four thousand or even more.

51
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:30,763
Scott: So it's like whatever I spend like I charge like $1,000 a month So it's no big deal.

52
00:03:31,285 --> 00:03:33,774
Rym: Yeah, but I charge a little more than that.

53
00:03:33,794 --> 00:03:35,339
Scott: So you're buying too much.

54
00:03:36,962 --> 00:03:37,666
Rym: Buy a lot of stuff.

55
00:03:37,686 --> 00:03:38,149
Rym: What do you want?

56
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:38,471
Rym: Plus it.

57
00:03:38,532 --> 00:03:38,794
Rym: I've been.

58
00:03:39,357 --> 00:03:43,600
Rym: it's weird now The economy's gone down, but I haven't really changed my spending habits.

59
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,087
Scott: Well, I haven't either because I was frugal before.

60
00:03:46,148 --> 00:03:50,280
Scott: so I can't really get more frugal without starting to actually make sacrifices.

61
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,616
Scott: But I don't need to because I've been frugal and my bank account even I'm still employed.

62
00:03:54,676 --> 00:03:55,640
Scott: I still make the same money.

63
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,520
Scott: Yeah, so I still am getting a profit.

64
00:03:58,661 --> 00:04:06,772
Scott: The only reason I'm not actually seeing the actual number go way up is so that I keep Shoving thousands of dollars to pay off the car sooner than I'm supposed to.

65
00:04:06,993 --> 00:04:09,180
Rym: it was just weird to have something like that happen.

66
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,595
Rym: It was one of those kind of secondary effects of a shrinking economy.

67
00:04:12,616 --> 00:04:13,500
Scott: Can you just cancel the card?

68
00:04:14,401 --> 00:04:17,800
Scott: Yeah, see the thing is you have to go around to all the automatic places.

69
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:20,454
Scott: You're automatically paying stuff with the card and switch it up.

70
00:04:20,535 --> 00:04:21,519
Rym: I know and that totally sucks.

71
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,893
Rym: I mean, I'm having enough trouble switching banks.

72
00:04:23,994 --> 00:04:30,400
Scott: I know it's like if you switch banks I've got like five or six places that automatically take money out of my bank account automatically put money in plus.

73
00:04:30,822 --> 00:04:34,700
Scott: I gotta go and refill out all these forms to just to switch a bank if I want bank.

74
00:04:35,262 --> 00:04:36,447
Rym: I was thinking of switching to.

75
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,298
Rym: isn't doing so well now, so I don't know what to do.

76
00:04:40,142 --> 00:04:43,300
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know and even the Swiss banks are having trouble now.

77
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,650
Scott: They're getting forced to cough up their info as you can.

78
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:46,012
Scott: you can't.

79
00:04:46,032 --> 00:04:47,960
Scott: even you're not even safe in a Swiss bank anymore.

80
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,359
Scott: I mean, what what's the world coming to?

81
00:04:50,543 --> 00:04:52,320
Rym: Well, that's where you keep all your legal money, obviously.

82
00:04:53,381 --> 00:04:54,264
Scott: Well, yeah, duh.

83
00:04:54,404 --> 00:04:55,307
Scott: That's what they're for.

84
00:04:55,327 --> 00:05:04,608
Scott: I mean, I guess you know, there's still I mean my bank is you know a savings and loan from Connecticut and it's FDIC insured for you know what that's worth these things.

85
00:05:04,628 --> 00:05:11,580
Rym: My bank was a bank in Michigan a tiny little bank that got bought out By a bigger bank and bought out by a bigger bank and bought out by a bigger bank and bought out by a bigger bank.

86
00:05:11,982 --> 00:05:14,777
Rym: My routing number means nothing to anyone at this point.

87
00:05:14,797 --> 00:05:15,340
Scott: I mean, it's weird.

88
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:22,723
Scott: It's like I was in Connecticut right and when I was a kid There were basically two banks still two banks that sort of had a lot of branches and you know There were always.

89
00:05:22,744 --> 00:05:25,200
Scott: you know, there would be a Chase Bank like one branch of it.

90
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,620
Scott: You know, there'd be one HSBC branch, right?

91
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:28,069
Scott: But there was.

92
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:39,679
Scott: you know There are a whole bunch of people's bank branches and a whole bunch of these like it was like Connecticut something Bank right and the Connecticut something Brank one day got bought by this other bank Shawmut and it was a big deal.

93
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:44,680
Scott: and Then with like in no time at all Shawmut got bought by something else and got bought by something else.

94
00:05:45,061 --> 00:05:48,012
Scott: And now it's like a Wachovia owns whatever that used to be right?

95
00:05:48,052 --> 00:05:50,000
Scott: It's like the fifth time has been bought out.

96
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,472
Scott: Yep, but people's bank is still there.

97
00:05:52,492 --> 00:05:53,979
Scott: It's still people's bank.

98
00:05:53,999 --> 00:06:02,380
Scott: and Back when you know things are starting to get bad I went to their website because that's where all my money is and they say it was like right on the front page.

99
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:09,860
Scott: People's Bank largely untouched by you know lack of money in bad mortgages not too bad.

100
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:13,371
Scott: Oh, it's like they're just carry, you know, it's a savings alone Bank.

101
00:06:13,431 --> 00:06:16,140
Scott: It's perfectly normal and mundane in every way.

102
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:21,375
Scott: It's it's pretty much only in Connecticut and I think Massachusetts and it's.

103
00:06:21,576 --> 00:06:22,498
Scott: it's just fine.

104
00:06:22,598 --> 00:06:26,091
Rym: the real trouble I had those that I never really wrote checks.

105
00:06:26,312 --> 00:06:28,540
Rym: So I got a book of checks when I opened this account.

106
00:06:28,901 --> 00:06:33,900
Rym: So my book of checks not only says the name of a bank that doesn't exist anymore.

107
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,549
Rym: That is four generations removed from the bank.

108
00:06:36,609 --> 00:06:37,191
Rym: I use now.

109
00:06:37,211 --> 00:06:39,458
Rym: Yeah, but it has my mom's name.

110
00:06:40,341 --> 00:06:44,940
Rym: My checks have my mom's name and they have an address that no one in my family has lived at.

111
00:06:45,622 --> 00:06:46,966
Scott: That's a problem a decade.

112
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:47,167
Scott: Yeah.

113
00:06:47,347 --> 00:06:49,574
Scott: Well, I mean I got an account at.

114
00:06:49,715 --> 00:06:51,280
Scott: you know that whatever other bank, right?

115
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,400
Scott: But then when I left to go to college I had it, you know, I'm checking account and like, you know way early.

116
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:03,160
Scott: but then when I left to go to college, I switched to the People's Bank because The People's Bank had a special college deal that let me get you know.

117
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,118
Scott: All the no ATM fees and all that other business I got going on.

118
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:15,260
Scott: That's you know, so I switched the account over and I had basically when I was in high school I had these Dilbert checks and then I had like a whole box of checks, right?

119
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:22,171
Scott: and then I barely used any of them and I switched accounts and then I got the superhero checks and I still have The superhero checks.

120
00:07:22,211 --> 00:07:22,917
Scott: That's how few I use.

121
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:23,762
Rym: I ran into.

122
00:07:23,802 --> 00:07:28,819
Scott: these checks are literally like I've had them for over a debt for a decade or more.

123
00:07:29,442 --> 00:07:41,524
Rym: My well, I have this box of HSBC checks because I opened an account there when I was at RIT But then I didn't use it because almost right away like my bank got bought out again and then a local bank in Rochester Turned into my bank.

124
00:07:42,047 --> 00:07:43,472
Rym: No, so I just gave up on HSBC.

125
00:07:43,492 --> 00:07:45,320
Rym: I was like pull all my money out and left it.

126
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,560
Scott: So no, maybe maybe you could go to HSBC.

127
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:52,876
Scott: I mean, they're not, you know, no one's doing well, but they're an okay International Bank.

128
00:07:52,896 --> 00:07:56,710
Rym: We're up relatively solid yeah, but my real trouble is when I got.

129
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:05,636
Rym: part of the reason I want to shift banks is because my routing number and everything is so old that Getting new checks because I actually use my last personal check the only because I only ever got one.

130
00:08:05,656 --> 00:08:08,820
Scott: when you get a new bank Account usually they give you one book of checks.

131
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:16,706
Rym: Yes for free But I can't get checks with my current account because the routing numbers and all this stuff Associated with it is so old.

132
00:08:16,786 --> 00:08:22,760
Rym: and it's been I'm sure if you went to the bag I did and they like couldn't figure it Out and they wanted to charge me all this money.

133
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:33,440
Scott: Well, yeah, that's the thing is when you get checks from some online check printing place They're wicked cheap, but when you buy them at the bank They always charge you an arm and a leg, but you know, what sucked when I got the superhero checks?

134
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,868
Scott: You know why I got the superhero checks.

135
00:08:34,888 --> 00:08:36,880
Scott: Why'd you get the super super cheap, right?

136
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:39,809
Scott: Yeah, the the actual bank the old they.

137
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:48,260
Scott: they had a partnership with this company called like deluxe Right that printed checks and they charge like ten times the amount that everyone else charged for printing check.

138
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:53,654
Rym: Actually what I learned because you know, I reprint stuff for GeekNights Like we got our new business cards and all that stuff we do and I print it.

139
00:08:53,855 --> 00:09:00,560
Rym: I do a lot of printing Mm-hmm, but I've discovered that now a lot of places and many of them didn't do it until recently.

140
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,390
Rym: But you can just make whatever kind of check you want.

141
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,313
Scott: Yeah, you can make whatever you want.

142
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:04,895
Scott: It's no big deal.

143
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:09,959
Rym: and But thinking about making some kind of awesome checks, right?

144
00:09:10,201 --> 00:09:18,540
Scott: But this this place that partnered with the bank You know that you know is the official check provider for the bank that you know charged arm and a leg more than anyone else.

145
00:09:19,661 --> 00:09:22,910
Scott: They offered Star Wars checks that no one else offered.

146
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:30,011
Scott: It was like, ah, I Could get and they were way more awesome than any of the checks you could.

147
00:09:30,031 --> 00:09:31,174
Scott: I mean there's literally.

148
00:09:31,255 --> 00:09:31,977
Scott: I looked around.

149
00:09:32,218 --> 00:09:34,649
Scott: there was nowhere To get Star Wars checks.

150
00:09:34,689 --> 00:09:36,600
Scott: They added the like the exclusive license.

151
00:09:36,781 --> 00:09:42,180
Rym: Maybe we should make the GeekNights checkbook and then you know, you would get GeekNights checks besides us.

152
00:09:42,421 --> 00:09:42,762
Rym: I don't know.

153
00:09:42,822 --> 00:09:46,659
Rym: I mean if if one of the checks already home today, I mean the thing is right.

154
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:52,820
Scott: I had one box of checks for a decade and I haven't even used up half of it.

155
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,792
Scott: Yeah that and checks are going.

156
00:09:54,812 --> 00:09:57,405
Scott: the way of the dodo bird Going there's.

157
00:09:57,866 --> 00:10:01,640
Rym: I basically only write checks to interface with people who don't use modern.

158
00:10:01,741 --> 00:10:04,100
Scott: I only write checks and I want to buy dodo birds.

159
00:10:05,503 --> 00:10:12,978
Scott: They're kind of hard to come by yeah But Odio, alright, so we did book club last Thursday, right?

160
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:25,880
Scott: But One thing that people mentioned that is was absolutely right is that we didn't do Well, not not only did we not do a good job of selling the next book We didn't do any job of selling the next book.

161
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,479
Scott: I pretty much said the next book is gonna be this the end?

162
00:10:29,781 --> 00:10:37,906
Rym: Well, I guess I assumed that people knew who Ernest Hemingway was and that I wouldn't need to sell Ernest Hemingway to people.

163
00:10:38,348 --> 00:10:41,960
Scott: Well, no, we're talking about the book that I was selling after we were done with the Ernest Hemingway.

164
00:10:42,201 --> 00:10:46,437
Rym: Oh, yeah, well considering how few people listen to the Hemingway episode.

165
00:10:46,778 --> 00:10:49,352
Rym: It's true I think many people even know what book we're doing next.

166
00:10:49,694 --> 00:10:50,600
Scott: Yeah, it's also true.

167
00:10:50,801 --> 00:10:52,450
Scott: But anyway, so I think I don't know.

168
00:10:52,591 --> 00:10:56,420
Scott: maybe you know Mix up the book club a little bit more.

169
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:01,080
Scott: Like should we do the selling of the next book and the reviewing of the previous book?

170
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,451
Scott: Like, you know, some people suggested we do the half-and-half.

171
00:11:03,874 --> 00:11:05,080
Scott: I think that's not a bad idea.

172
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:15,823
Scott: Yeah And actually maybe if we do the selling of the next book in the first half That might actually work better for people who didn't read, you know, if they listen to the episode right away They get them.

173
00:11:16,003 --> 00:11:17,531
Scott: they get the selling because that's what they need.

174
00:11:17,592 --> 00:11:23,300
Scott: if you haven't read the book You know you you want the selling right away rather than you know the review of the book.

175
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,459
Rym: You didn't read right away, but I think for now we're just gonna kind of play it by ear and just kind of.

176
00:11:27,882 --> 00:11:34,237
Rym: we're just gonna do the book club stuff as it comes up and as it makes sense because Overthinking it is just gonna cause trouble exactly.

177
00:11:34,297 --> 00:11:39,820
Scott: So Anyway, I want to spend you know a few minutes here to sell you on the next book.

178
00:11:40,141 --> 00:11:43,533
Scott: Right, because if you haven't read this book the Sun, you know you you.

179
00:11:43,835 --> 00:11:45,260
Scott: this is sort of one of those books.

180
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:50,020
Scott: It's a little bit more the of the then some of the other books we've done in the book club.

181
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,920
Scott: In fact, this is probably like my new favorite book since I read it.

182
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,486
Scott: But anyway, that's a heady claim.

183
00:11:55,967 --> 00:12:01,665
Scott: The book is the amazing adventures of cavalier and clay Written by Michael Chabon.

184
00:12:01,786 --> 00:12:04,252
Scott: it won the Pulitzer Prize.

185
00:12:04,332 --> 00:12:07,700
Scott: You cannot win a better prize than that for writing things.

186
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,604
Scott: It's not possible.

187
00:12:08,725 --> 00:12:11,840
Rym: What if you win the Nobel Peace Prize because you wrote a book that fostered?

188
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,053
Scott: It's not a book for we discussed this already.

189
00:12:14,073 --> 00:12:15,280
Scott: That's not a book for writing.

190
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,998
Scott: You could win the Nobel Prize for literature.

191
00:12:17,281 --> 00:12:23,132
Scott: You could win the Nobel Prize for literature But that is not as good as the Pulitzer Prize.

192
00:12:23,212 --> 00:12:30,080
Scott: It is one step below and in the book of Scott Alright, so when a book wins the Pulitzer Prize, that's serious business.

193
00:12:30,161 --> 00:12:37,132
Scott: I mean we've done some books that are like, you know, pretty great I mean Scott Hemingway and such not Pulitzer Prize winner.

194
00:12:37,192 --> 00:12:38,817
Rym: What won the last Pulitzer Prize?

195
00:12:39,097 --> 00:12:39,900
Scott: I don't know.

196
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:42,053
Rym: Can you name any other books that won Pulitzer Prizes?

197
00:12:42,797 --> 00:12:53,467
Scott: I could I. Actually, I saw someone who had the newest Pulitzer Prize winning thing on the train the other day and I forgot what it was But I meant to go and add it to my Amazon.

198
00:12:53,487 --> 00:12:53,848
Rym: whatever.

199
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:55,634
Rym: I can point out that this book.

200
00:12:56,296 --> 00:12:57,339
Rym: I have not read it.

201
00:12:57,842 --> 00:13:00,397
Rym: I'm the only person in the world who hasn't read it.

202
00:13:00,417 --> 00:13:01,121
Scott: I don't know I don't.

203
00:13:01,182 --> 00:13:02,792
Scott: I don't know how much of the crew has read it.

204
00:13:03,013 --> 00:13:05,599
Scott: I think I don't know if Alex I mean, I know me and Emily have read it.

205
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,605
Scott: I don't know anyone else though.

206
00:13:06,665 --> 00:13:09,820
Rym: now the thing is because Emily knows that we're doing this as the next book.

207
00:13:10,302 --> 00:13:12,994
Rym: She's reading it again and I get to read it again.

208
00:13:13,014 --> 00:13:15,165
Rym: Yeah, but you know this crew I've only read it once.

209
00:13:15,387 --> 00:13:21,540
Rym: this crew is not a crew that will often Reconsume media unless that media is of the highest quality.

210
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:25,595
Scott: Yeah, so let me let me just tell you what this book is about a little bit, right?

211
00:13:25,655 --> 00:13:31,780
Scott: So it's a novel it's a. it's a fictional story of These two cousins, right?

212
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,451
Scott: Cavalier and Clay I forget what their.

213
00:13:36,551 --> 00:13:42,080
Scott: I think it was a Joe Cavalier and what's Forget the first name of the other guy, but it doesn't really matter so much.

214
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:50,662
Scott: Anyway, you know, they're like Jewish cousins and one guy is you know a Jew living in I think Brooklyn right and the other guy Cavalier.

215
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:59,640
Scott: so clay lives in Brooklyn right and Cavalier was in Europe during you know The Holocaust and such and his family sent him away to go live with the cousins in America, right?

216
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,869
Scott: So you have that sort of Holocaust story, right?

217
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:21,980
Scott: You've also got this, you know sort of Retelling mishmash of the history of comic books in America right as he basically tells all these stories that are obviously just Riffs on the true stories of Eisner and Eiger and Simon and Schuster and all these famous American comic artists, right?

218
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:28,000
Scott: He retells their stories with Cavalier and clay as you know, the artist and writer of the comics, right?

219
00:14:28,602 --> 00:14:31,980
Scott: You've also got adventure stories going on, right?

220
00:14:32,261 --> 00:14:37,155
Scott: You've also got escapist like, you know, Houdini kind of action going on.

221
00:14:37,657 --> 00:14:43,320
Scott: You've also got The golem, you know going on the whole story of the golem of Prague.

222
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:47,656
Scott: I like golems great and that ties in with the Houdini parts, right?

223
00:14:47,917 --> 00:14:55,940
Scott: You've also Got, you know sort of like, you know, this love story and dealing, you know with like, you know art and a lot.

224
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,891
Scott: It there's a lot of New York in this book.

225
00:14:57,952 --> 00:14:58,998
Scott: a whole bunch of New York.

226
00:14:59,521 --> 00:15:05,447
Scott: Empire State Building plays a huge part in this book And they turned the Empire State Building into a golem.

227
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:07,753
Scott: No, okay, not it's not ridiculous.

228
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:09,518
Scott: It's it's there's nothing in here.

229
00:15:09,578 --> 00:15:12,265
Scott: That is Magical or unbelievable.

230
00:15:12,285 --> 00:15:13,690
Scott: you got war story in here.

231
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:16,299
Scott: There's a whole, you know war action going on.

232
00:15:16,621 --> 00:15:26,717
Scott: That's part of the adventure, you know, and you've also got You know lots of you know, it's it's just all these things right that seem like they would be separate books.

233
00:15:27,158 --> 00:15:34,178
Scott: yet somehow They're all in this one story with these, you know, two characters sort of at the center of.

234
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:45,434
Scott: you know the vast majority of it and It's really pretty thrilling and pretty much It doesn't hurt that all of those things like right down the alley of Scott Rubin.

235
00:15:45,454 --> 00:16:00,452
Scott: It's like comic books Jews You know Houdini Adventure, you know all the all in one in one book and it's you know It's one of the best books I've ever read and I could.

236
00:16:00,472 --> 00:16:02,260
Scott: I could probably read it like ten more times.

237
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,350
Scott: I mean, it's like it's Watchmen.

238
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:04,691
Scott: good.

239
00:16:04,852 --> 00:16:05,897
Scott: That's how good this book is.

240
00:16:06,218 --> 00:16:10,273
Scott: So If you're gonna read one book club, I'm not.

241
00:16:10,293 --> 00:16:11,800
Scott: I promise I won't say this ever again.

242
00:16:12,001 --> 00:16:16,236
Scott: If you catch me saying this about any other book club book ever again Call me out.

243
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:28,021
Scott: Right, if you read if you're ever gonna do the book club even once and you're if you're only gonna do the book club once This should be the one time that you do it for this book and it's not an expensive book Let's see.

244
00:16:28,483 --> 00:16:31,131
Scott: The cover price is $15 for the softcover.

245
00:16:31,432 --> 00:16:33,940
Scott: So on Amazon, it's probably less than that.

246
00:16:34,684 --> 00:16:35,630
Scott: It's got to be less than that.

247
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:37,060
Scott: It's got to be like eight or something like that.

248
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,978
Scott: I'm just guessing I don't have a computer in front of me.

249
00:16:39,641 --> 00:16:42,530
Scott: So the amazing adventures of cavalier and clay.

250
00:16:43,091 --> 00:16:47,724
Scott: cavalier is spelt with a K clay is spelt with the C Willing to it.

00:17:00,267 --> 00:17:00,669
Scott: This isn't?

259
00:17:01,252 --> 00:17:12,257
Scott: this isn't like a sissy book Away, I think it's so.

00:17:28,252 --> 00:17:29,716
Rym: All right, there's something about nutters.

263
00:17:30,398 --> 00:17:31,120
Scott: What's cat jazz?

264
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,004

Rym: Oh Titli ist is in here.

00:17:41,048 --> 00:17:41,650
Rym: or titleist?

270
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,636
Rym: but it looks like they interpreted as titli.

271
00:17:43,736 --> 00:17:45,945
Scott: is Oh titleist Like the golf ball?

272
00:17:46,247 --> 00:17:49,930
Scott: or titli is as in the most hits Bungle hater.

273
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:59,780
Rym: Oh geeked up Okay, so I found this list of all the license plates that were rejected by the state of Ohio.

274
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:02,787
Scott: See, I mean New York, right?

275
00:18:02,907 --> 00:18:06,418
Scott: I got fear and Rym got Oh Tory and they didn't reject right?

276
00:18:06,438 --> 00:18:06,960
Scott: They were cool.

277
00:18:07,362 --> 00:18:07,804
Scott: They were told.

278
00:18:07,844 --> 00:18:08,848
Scott: and I see you know what.

279
00:18:08,949 --> 00:18:13,779
Scott: I drive around New York and I see license plates And I see a lot of cool ones out there.

280
00:18:14,001 --> 00:18:25,200
Scott: So I know that someone whoever is approving and disapproving the vanity plates in New York I mean, they're obviously not gonna let like fuck you through but they're letting cool stuff through and they gotta let the ass man through.

281
00:18:25,582 --> 00:18:26,770
Scott: I know right ass man.

282
00:18:26,831 --> 00:18:29,362
Scott: I'm pretty sure that's real ass, man Right.

283
00:18:29,663 --> 00:18:32,694
Scott: So Ohio must just be fucking sticklers.

284
00:18:33,497 --> 00:18:37,623
Rym: No fact Penina, okay.

285
00:18:37,964 --> 00:18:42,016
Rym: All right con man con man one con man to con man three.

286
00:18:42,036 --> 00:18:59,822
Scott: I think someone was trying to get Right, but it's like, you know, I could understand, you know I mean first of all, right if I was in charge pretty much anything would be approved except for like 001 I 1 I 0.

287
00:18:59,822 --> 00:19:03,320
Rym: That was always my plan though because the cops wouldn't know what to do and I couldn't get my ticket.

288
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:09,059
Scott: Yeah the cops would have to look real close to get your correct license plate and if they they typed it in wrong they get.

289
00:19:09,099 --> 00:19:10,991
Scott: so that is obviously a license plate.

290
00:19:11,011 --> 00:19:13,343
Scott: that's not okay, but It's some.

291
00:19:13,363 --> 00:19:27,871
Scott: you know, I would be fine with fuck you but okay even if poop on you po up Oh and you yeah things even if you wanted to weed out profane license plates, okay Even by a pretty strict judgment.

292
00:19:28,313 --> 00:19:29,740
Scott: What's wrong with geeked up?

293
00:19:30,701 --> 00:19:33,149
Scott: I mean, how is that profane in any way?

294
00:19:33,189 --> 00:19:35,014
Rym: Well biting the heads off chickens.

295
00:19:35,315 --> 00:19:36,218
Rym: It's it's horrible.

296
00:19:36,379 --> 00:19:37,244
Scott: I know right I mean what?

297
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:37,707
Scott: what are the?

298
00:19:37,828 --> 00:19:39,180
Scott: there's a whole bunch of them on there?

299
00:19:39,461 --> 00:19:39,602
Scott: Like.

300
00:19:40,065 --> 00:19:49,131
Scott: I can understand rejecting some of these, you know Like maybe you maybe even the poop and the ass ones and the bitch wall Even though I feel like they should allow.

301
00:19:49,192 --> 00:19:49,815
Rym: they should allow.

302
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:50,538
Scott: I think they don't.

303
00:19:50,659 --> 00:19:56,980
Scott: you know I would like them to allow it but I can understand at least if they don't allow like dumb bitch, right?

304
00:19:57,322 --> 00:20:01,471
Rym: Well, I can understand that Rinzel, I can't think of anything bad exactly.

305
00:20:01,511 --> 00:20:02,855
Scott: What's wrong with Rinzel?

306
00:20:03,116 --> 00:20:04,180
Rym: Someone tried to get you think?

307
00:20:05,564 --> 00:20:07,199
Scott: See, I guess they knew what you think was.

308
00:20:07,986 --> 00:20:16,778
Scott: Maybe they just go to Urban Dictionary Maybe they search for every single thing on Google and find and that's why some of the ones are rejected because maybe just bad Search results come up.

309
00:20:18,081 --> 00:20:19,526
Rym: Related I hate Ohio.

310
00:20:19,546 --> 00:20:20,509
Scott: Oh, yeah, they got anything.

311
00:20:20,529 --> 00:20:21,212
Scott: This is sucks.

312
00:20:21,252 --> 00:20:23,640
Scott: They don't allow which it's pretty consistent.

313
00:20:24,021 --> 00:20:27,010
Rym: Yeah, but fuck I can't figure out what wife up.

314
00:20:27,191 --> 00:20:29,517
Scott: I guess it's just you know, fuck you people.

315
00:20:29,598 --> 00:20:32,672
Rym: I don't know I don't know but fuck it's kind of too classy.

316
00:20:32,692 --> 00:20:33,194
Rym: I like fuck.

317
00:20:33,516 --> 00:20:34,280
Scott: Yeah, what's I can fuck?

318
00:20:34,341 --> 00:20:35,400
Scott: I don't see anything wrong with that.

319
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:35,882
Scott: But I don't know.

320
00:20:36,323 --> 00:20:40,900
Scott: a lot of these seem like they were rejected even though they weren't profane and I think there might be room.

321
00:20:41,061 --> 00:20:42,891
Scott: I'm not a lawyer, but here's what.

322
00:20:42,912 --> 00:20:43,857
Rym: here's what bothers me.

323
00:20:44,038 --> 00:20:48,053
Rym: one Profane is very different from obscene.

324
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:48,696
Scott: That's true.

325
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:53,449
Rym: And Here are the guidelines that Ohio uses from the article.

326
00:20:53,469 --> 00:20:56,218
Rym: All right, they will block any license plate.

327
00:20:56,258 --> 00:20:58,600
Rym: that quote advocates lawlessness.

328
00:20:59,162 --> 00:21:06,903
Rym: Okay quote could reasonably be expected to provoke a violent response without additional comments Mm-hmm.

329
00:21:07,164 --> 00:21:11,620
Rym: So apparently geeked up either promotes lawlessness or will provoke a violent response.

330
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,645
Scott: Oh those the only two.

331
00:21:13,207 --> 00:21:19,205
Rym: or our quote profane obscene sexually explicit or Scatological.

332
00:21:19,226 --> 00:21:27,748
Scott: No, that's explains the poop ones Logical but P is okay Apparently unless it's obscene or profane.

333
00:21:27,768 --> 00:21:28,651
Rym: now here's what bothers me.

334
00:21:29,534 --> 00:21:33,683
Rym: obscene means one thing but profane There shouldn't.

335
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:38,640
Rym: you shouldn't be able to restrict profanity because profanity has religious connotations.

336
00:21:39,841 --> 00:21:40,604
Rym: You shouldn't I don't.

337
00:21:40,624 --> 00:21:46,120
Rym: I think that someone in Ohio could sue on the grounds that the state cannot restrict profane license plates.

338
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:52,140
Rym: They can restrict obscene ones and all these other things, but I don't think I think you'd have a good case against profane.

339
00:21:52,241 --> 00:21:54,606
Scott: it is a question for Thades.

340
00:21:54,667 --> 00:22:04,101
Rym: friend ray the First Amendment lawyer from Ohio Of course I also feel like could reasonably be expected to provoke a violent response doesn't fit with pretty much any of these unless yeah It's like.

341
00:22:04,221 --> 00:22:07,472
Scott: what license plate could you make that would elicit?

342
00:22:07,753 --> 00:22:10,000
Rym: or what kind of people are living in, Ohio?

343
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:14,460
Scott: Examine like me, you know what I you know, it could evoke a violent response.

344
00:22:15,061 --> 00:22:15,884
Scott: Fuck the cops.

345
00:22:15,944 --> 00:22:21,500
Scott: that would have listed a violent response from the cops, right or like kill police or kill cops.

346
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,022
Scott: That would.

347
00:22:22,042 --> 00:22:26,515
Scott: that would be you know, not work out, but I mean geeked up.

348
00:22:26,736 --> 00:22:27,056
Rym: Okay.

349
00:22:27,197 --> 00:22:28,842
Rym: Okay kill yourself I don't know.

350
00:22:28,862 --> 00:22:32,053
Rym: I can find that kind of funny and naked Dave and beetle bomb.

351
00:22:32,655 --> 00:22:33,920
Scott: Yeah, what's wrong with those?

352
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,418
Scott: I don't know ultra pimp.

353
00:22:36,881 --> 00:22:45,393
Scott: I think even by those rules a lot of a lot of these license plates are not obscene profane They don't have vocal violent response.

354
00:22:45,434 --> 00:22:46,420
Scott: They're not scat illogical.

355
00:22:46,762 --> 00:22:50,540
Scott: You know some of them are but a lot of them aren't and it's sort of fucked up.

356
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,875
Rym: But I feel like scat illogical should be a requirement.

357
00:22:53,278 --> 00:23:00,665
Scott: Yeah just Ohio the poop state I Mean we already know that it is.

358
00:23:00,685 --> 00:23:03,596
Scott: we might as well, you know, just say okay proud.

359
00:23:03,656 --> 00:23:04,780
Rym: Okay eat poo.

360
00:23:11,082 --> 00:23:14,600
Scott: It is scat illogical though, so it is against law, but it's kind of funny.

361
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:18,896
Rym: I don't know if I saw if I was driving and I saw a license plate that said eat poo.

362
00:23:18,916 --> 00:23:24,189
Rym: I Would not be driven to this mad enraged act of violence.

363
00:23:24,329 --> 00:23:26,594
Scott: I would drive next to the person to give him a high-five.

364
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,260
Rym: Oh Well, I've had vanity place my whole life.

365
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:38,344
Rym: I will have vanity place for the rest of my life because the the minor cost involved is worth it for the fact that a Lot of people see that.

366
00:23:38,805 --> 00:23:39,046
Scott: Yeah.

367
00:23:39,528 --> 00:23:46,419
Scott: Anyway, so a long time ago on the show I did a thing of the day about a patent that is owned by?

368
00:23:46,499 --> 00:24:03,692
Scott: well I don't know if you own a patent but a patent that was issued to mr Penn Gillette of Penn & Teller and his patent was for the Jill jet, which is a a device that you have in a hot tub that shoots a jet of water for pleasuring women and You know, he uses it quite often.

369
00:24:03,913 --> 00:24:10,217
Scott: I can I can tell you that But I discovered more recently another patent owned by a mr.

370
00:24:10,397 --> 00:24:11,200
Scott: Michael Jackson.

371
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:17,860
Scott: Yes, the white scary guy of thrillers isn't like Michael Jackson like a micro and his micro of software.

372
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:27,630
Scott: No This is actually a patent that was issued to a US patent issued to be Michael Jackson who by the way is a Selling a bunch of his stuff on auction including.

373
00:24:27,871 --> 00:24:29,937
Scott: He has really good taste in arcade games.

374
00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:37,200
Scott: So If you want some of his really good and pristine arcade machines, they are up for auction.

375
00:24:38,204 --> 00:24:39,678
Scott: Some of them are really really hot too.

376
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:47,480
Scott: Secondly he's I just read in the news today that like he's going to do live concerts and that's sort of fucked up.

377
00:24:47,641 --> 00:24:47,922
Scott: How's he?

378
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:49,472
Scott: can he still do a live concert?

379
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:50,700
Rym: I saw some article though.

380
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,256
Rym: He went to the doctor to find out if he can still do concerts.

381
00:24:53,538 --> 00:24:55,911
Scott: really Yeah, he said he's gonna do ten shows.

382
00:24:55,971 --> 00:25:01,659
Rym: So it's like, huh, you know If he he'll probably do one in New York, I would consider I think he was doing it.

383
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:08,780
Rym: I just it was like an England didn't say about the u.s Cuz I I would probably go see him just so I could say in my life that I saw Michael Jackson.

384
00:25:08,921 --> 00:25:17,429
Scott: Well, I mean, that's the thing right even if he's a scary dude Even if he's like yeah It's like there's like one of the greatest albums ever made.

385
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:22,868
Scott: if he can still perform the music in the same way It's like it's I was.

386
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:25,960
Scott: go see a Mike Tyson fight, you know cherries a piece of shit.

387
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,551
Scott: But you go on YouTube and watch him beat the shit out of someone.

388
00:25:29,591 --> 00:25:31,135
Scott: It's so fucking amazing.

389
00:25:31,256 --> 00:25:32,740
Rym: I don't make a license plate about it.

390
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:33,523
Scott: Oh, yeah, that's right.

391
00:25:33,663 --> 00:25:37,015
Scott: Um, but anyway, so this is a patent owned by Michael Jackson.

392
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:43,427
Scott: what the patent is for If you know, Michael Jackson is is sort of like oh That's all right.

393
00:25:43,911 --> 00:25:45,020
Scott: So do you remember?

394
00:25:45,980 --> 00:26:01,700
Scott: When Michael Jackson would dance and he would lean over and he would lean so far over yet Somehow he would not fall down even though he was leaning Impossibly far and possibly beyond the point where his center of gravity would tip now.

395
00:26:01,921 --> 00:26:03,992
Rym: I just always assumed he was awesome.

396
00:26:04,052 --> 00:26:05,058
Rym: I would try to do that.

397
00:26:05,118 --> 00:26:08,479
Scott: as a kid I thought that he just really strong leg muscles or that there was.

398
00:26:08,499 --> 00:26:14,860
Scott: you know I never even thought about like, you know what the trick was or what but he always did that dance where he leaned really far.

399
00:26:15,822 --> 00:26:23,060
Scott: So this patent is for the thing that lets him lean really far and I'll let you Look at the patent yourself and go oh and feel stupid like the rest of us.

400
00:26:27,745 --> 00:26:29,879
Rym: Yeah, so where my lasers at?

401
00:26:36,341 --> 00:26:40,196
Scott: So we we took us a while to come up with what to do the show on but we finally settled.

402
00:26:40,477 --> 00:26:46,645
Scott: we're gonna talk about laser crabs laser crab paint balls and airsofts.

403
00:26:46,685 --> 00:26:54,000
Rym: all the sort of real-world FPS is Cuz I'll admit, you know when I was a kid we're thinking about it.

404
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,523
Rym: I was a kid.

405
00:26:54,604 --> 00:26:55,328
Rym: you're all kids.

406
00:26:55,449 --> 00:27:01,659
Rym: at some point a lot of you still are kids and You had guns like fake guns water guns super soakers.

407
00:27:02,141 --> 00:27:03,144
Rym: The lowest level is.

408
00:27:03,164 --> 00:27:07,540
Rym: the lowest level is like the P the object that is shaped like a gun.

409
00:27:07,941 --> 00:27:09,287
Rym: That does not work in any way.

410
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:09,467
Rym: Like.

411
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:11,194
Scott: I used it as a trigger and it goes click.

412
00:27:11,536 --> 00:27:11,757
Rym: No.

413
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:13,525
Rym: No, that's the step up I'm talking about like.

414
00:27:13,827 --> 00:27:17,385
Rym: I took some waffle blocks and made a gun Oh carried it around.

415
00:27:17,405 --> 00:27:22,267
Scott: then you just took some Legos and you made a right angle where one side was longer than the other side Or like I'm.

416
00:27:22,287 --> 00:27:26,578
Rym: when I was a kid I remember I knew a lot of friends whose parents like wouldn't let their kids play with guns.

417
00:27:26,962 --> 00:27:40,760
Scott: Those kids As a tangent I want to say right I found it so strange that Kids who were like, you know, hick, you know Hicks or maybe you know actually had real guns.

418
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:59,140
Scott: You know like you would go to summer camp right and they have Riflery and people would actually fire real guns in the rifle range and you would have like eight-year-old kids on the rifle range of 22s and They were very you know, I mean these weren't mature kids They were eight years old but on the rifle range they handled themselves very maturely.

419
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,473
Scott: They would never point the gun at anyone else.

420
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:02,820
Scott: They would never do anything stupid.

421
00:28:03,302 --> 00:28:07,317
Scott: You know everyone was there and taking things very seriously and and such and such.

422
00:28:07,357 --> 00:28:12,559
Scott: and you know No one had sort of like this unsafe fascination with guns or anything like that.

423
00:28:13,342 --> 00:28:23,480
Scott: but when you're you know, when you I would go to like a kid's house, right or A kid would come over and it was some kid who wasn't allowed to have any toy guns by his parents.

424
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,474
Scott: Those kids who weren't allowed any, you know exposure to guns at all.

425
00:28:28,775 --> 00:28:32,666
Scott: We're just sort of Dangerously fascinated with toy guns.

426
00:28:32,686 --> 00:28:47,840
Scott: and if you took them like I would go to a birthday party and you like at someone's house you had a toy gun or two and you could tell that like Some of the kids at the party would just be like so fascinated with the toy guns They would just play with them and ignore everything else and the rest of us would be like what the fuck's wrong with you guys.

427
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,225
Scott: Why are you playing with the toy guns?

428
00:28:49,265 --> 00:28:56,320
Scott: We got like freaking, you know, gigantic transformer here who makes noise And lights up and is like, you know two feet long.

429
00:28:57,482 --> 00:28:58,406
Scott: What are you guys doing?

430
00:28:59,088 --> 00:29:04,141
Scott: You know, and they were just you know in credit and I Think that you know We.

431
00:29:04,522 --> 00:29:15,920
Scott: a better way or something that we could do to have better gun safety is to have you know Proper, you know 22 rifle marksmanship as you know in school.

432
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,351
Rym: Of course the the beg to question if you want.

433
00:29:18,371 --> 00:29:20,059
Rym: we're not gonna debate gun ownership right now.

434
00:29:21,367 --> 00:29:22,039
Rym: Is that?

435
00:29:22,923 --> 00:29:27,079
Rym: Why do we live in a society where we have to make sure everyone is super cool with guns?

436
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,566
Scott: Exactly, but that's that's neither here.

437
00:29:29,586 --> 00:29:29,647
Rym: But

438
00:29:29,747 --> 00:29:50,704
Scott: anyway, the point is is that I think it's related to laser tag, you know paintball airsoft because These are sort of ways in which you can sort of you know Learn about guns and weapons and sort of aiming and using them and and such in a very safe and risk-free Environment.

439
00:29:50,764 --> 00:29:53,300
Scott: and also, you know, they're it's sort of weird.

440
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:56,231
Scott: It's like you can play an FPS but an FPS is not.

441
00:29:56,251 --> 00:30:07,315
Scott: this is like, you know a totally other level We're talking about here, you know, even laser tag is like a way way more than an FPS is Yep, and I just I love it and I want to do more of it.

442
00:30:07,335 --> 00:30:08,240
Rym: cuz I remember when I was a kid.

443
00:30:08,381 --> 00:30:10,699
Rym: You know first it was just we had to play with like whatever we had.

444
00:30:11,201 --> 00:30:16,978
Rym: But then the nerf revolution happened and so therefore for Kevin suddenly you could prove there's no more.

445
00:30:16,998 --> 00:30:17,520
Rym: I shot you.

446
00:30:18,143 --> 00:30:20,393
Rym: No, you didn't it was hit you in the face.

447
00:30:20,413 --> 00:30:21,780
Rym: I gotcha you're done.

448
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:24,279
Scott: Then you put thumb tacks on the end of him and you know, and you hit somebody.

449
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,242
Rym: No, I went.

450
00:30:26,463 --> 00:30:28,328
Rym: I really I went on a different tack.

451
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:29,773
Rym: I modified my nerf guns.

452
00:30:30,174 --> 00:30:34,550
Rym: I remember one time Greg an old FRC person we haven't talked to in a while.

453
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:37,682
Rym: They kind of went off on their own way, but we Even.

454
00:30:37,722 --> 00:30:42,060
Rym: he came out with me to Michigan to go to Cedar Point and we were hanging out in my parents house.

455
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:45,293
Scott: It was like after freshman year of uni and you had your modified bow and arrow is there.

456
00:30:45,313 --> 00:30:48,419
Rym: I had my modified nerf gun That I'd modified when I was a kid.

457
00:30:48,781 --> 00:30:53,640
Rym: So we walked down and in the basement and I turn around he's coming down the stairs and I say check out my nerf gun.

458
00:30:53,941 --> 00:30:55,164
Rym: And he goes, yeah, what of it?

459
00:30:55,746 --> 00:30:59,577
Rym: and I shot it at him and he goes holy shit followed by fuck.

460
00:31:03,341 --> 00:31:04,325
Rym: It was most excellent.

461
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:05,609
Scott: that's good stuff.

462
00:31:06,091 --> 00:31:06,974
Rym: that thing hurt you.

463
00:31:06,994 --> 00:31:07,736
Scott: just what had you do?

464
00:31:07,796 --> 00:31:08,840
Scott: rubber bands now?

465
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,662
Rym: Well, all I did.

466
00:31:09,683 --> 00:31:12,873
Rym: I took the that six shot that shot regular nerf arrows.

467
00:31:12,893 --> 00:31:14,177
Rym: Yeah from a six shooter.

468
00:31:14,297 --> 00:31:15,923
Rym: Yeah, I put a Arrow storm.

469
00:31:15,964 --> 00:31:16,064
Scott: Yes.

470
00:31:16,084 --> 00:31:28,080
Rym: Yes, I put a Gigantic spring in it and instead of shooting the big arrows I shot the little orange suction darts from the nerf like Razorback.

471
00:31:29,823 --> 00:31:32,434
Scott: So you put the arrows inside the holes instead of around.

472
00:31:32,715 --> 00:31:34,020
Rym: yep shit be crazy.

473
00:31:34,422 --> 00:31:38,138
Scott: Yeah, that then there's no friction of its sliding off the plastic shaft or any.

474
00:31:38,178 --> 00:31:38,419
Scott: yeah

475
00:31:38,741 --> 00:31:49,097
Rym: But I mean that still it wasn't really fun enough because while you can play the awesome nerf bow and arrow and everything Well, I need to go pick up all those arrows afterward and the neighbor kid would always like lose all your arrows and

476
00:31:49,639 --> 00:31:50,162
Scott: tell me About it.

477
00:31:50,324 --> 00:31:52,079
Rym: You could always dodge those things.

478
00:31:52,441 --> 00:31:57,160
Scott: Oh even for you know, if you were anywhere with any sort of range and you saw it coming it wasn't gonna hit you.

479
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:59,120
Rym: I mean, they're not like night arrows, right?

480
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,746
Scott: So, you know really it's like you want to have.

481
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:20,124
Scott: you know, sort of the thrill and fun of having some sort of you know gun combat simulation, but you don't actually want anyone to get hurt right and You know, you just you just sort of want to and but you actually want to use you know Your physical abilities as opposed to say just your hands with an FPS.

482
00:32:20,144 --> 00:32:24,961
Scott: you actually want to walk around Actually duck actually crawl actually climb things.

483
00:32:25,022 --> 00:32:30,465
Rym: I still actually hide I feel like competition and fighting and things are still.

484
00:32:30,486 --> 00:32:46,110
Rym: you know humans are animals and I think There are a lot of things in humanity that harken back to our older days our more primitive days And I feel like there is this drive to fight and nothing is better than taking that drive and making an awesome game about it.

485
00:32:46,511 --> 00:32:48,136
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you're what are they?

486
00:32:48,176 --> 00:32:58,210
Scott: What else can you really do in terms of like, you know, satisfying this urge to fight But also doing it, you know for real soccer Lee right soccer that that work for Europe.

487
00:32:58,732 --> 00:33:12,044
Scott: Yeah, doing it physically and not simulating it right but also not getting hurt I mean even if you do martial arts or boxing or something along those lines I mean, you're not gonna get killed but you're it.

488
00:33:12,245 --> 00:33:16,948
Scott: you hurt sometimes, you know You get whacked with a stick or you get punched in the face and you go shit, you know.

489
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:20,970
Scott: Plus there's something about boxing, you know, I mean you're gonna get brain damage.

490
00:33:21,131 --> 00:33:34,304
Rym: It's it's gonna have the same reason why like boffin weapons are so much fun but I think there's it's different with gun because it's a lot more tactical and strategic and Reflexes and a lot less of all the other factors.

491
00:33:34,807 --> 00:33:35,470
Scott: Yeah, definitely.

492
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:40,870
Scott: Well, I mean, you know, you could do like, you know act like some of the real quote real sword fighting stuff.

493
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:41,974
Scott: You can sort of get that.

494
00:33:41,994 --> 00:33:46,310
Rym: Yeah, I've done fencing and I was hurt once by katsu doing kendo.

495
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:53,035
Scott: Yeah, but I mean the thing with sword fighting is I think it's more, you know, like Maneuvers and things like that.

496
00:33:53,076 --> 00:33:57,326
Scott: You're very close with the other person but with guns, you know, you're sort of you're.

497
00:33:57,446 --> 00:33:58,810
Scott: it's more about the environment.

498
00:33:59,011 --> 00:34:03,330
Scott: Right, you know you're jumping on things running away from things, you know dodging.

499
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:08,726
Scott: It's more of an extended thing as opposed to a quick reflexes thing like aha.

500
00:34:08,808 --> 00:34:09,429
Scott: Okay, it's over.

501
00:34:10,371 --> 00:34:14,683
Scott: You know guns is more like it's an extended engagement.

502
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:16,629
Scott: I think that's the best way of putting it.

503
00:34:18,091 --> 00:34:20,442
Scott: But anyway, you know, I've done paintball a few times.

504
00:34:20,482 --> 00:34:22,310
Scott: How many times you done paintball paintball?

505
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:23,697
Rym: I don't like three or four times.

506
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:25,168
Rym: I think max not that many.

507
00:34:25,812 --> 00:34:28,862
Rym: Yeah, two of those times were at RIT and two were in high school.

508
00:34:29,163 --> 00:34:29,364
Scott: Yeah.

509
00:34:29,966 --> 00:34:31,150
Scott: I only did it once at RIT.

510
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:33,339
Scott: I think I did it two or three times before then.

511
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,347
Rym: I think we did it didn't we go with like?

512
00:34:35,487 --> 00:34:35,929
Scott: yeah, we went.

513
00:34:37,072 --> 00:34:38,058
Scott: No in freshman year.

514
00:34:38,078 --> 00:34:40,210
Scott: We went with your floor.

515
00:34:41,051 --> 00:34:42,897
Scott: Yeah, we went laser tag with hello.

516
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:43,559
Rym: Yes, we did.

517
00:34:44,141 --> 00:34:51,310
Scott: Yeah when we went to laser tag, I complete it's like Scott dominated everyone like to a degree that was frightening.

518
00:34:51,471 --> 00:34:55,895
Scott: I say we went into this laser tag and it was a pretty good laser tag, basically You know, they had all these guns.

519
00:34:55,915 --> 00:34:56,879
Rym: Well, it was laser quest.

520
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,466
Rym: That's like the standard generic.

521
00:34:58,567 --> 00:35:01,037
Scott: Yeah for all laser Yeah, all the guns work right.

522
00:35:01,078 --> 00:35:03,488
Scott: you can shoot someone in the front or the back or the gun.

523
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:17,350
Scott: I think You can shoot as many times as you want right and every time you hit someone They're sort of they can't fight, you know They're sort of dead for a few seconds like what like five to ten seconds something like that And then when they come back to life then they can shoot again.

524
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:22,430
Scott: So it's basically when you shoot someone their gun gets turned off for a short time and then they're back in the game.

525
00:35:23,012 --> 00:35:28,910
Scott: So you want to get hit as little times as possible because that also enables you to hit others as many times as possible.

526
00:35:29,435 --> 00:35:32,012
Scott: And the rules I think were no running All right.

527
00:35:32,032 --> 00:35:34,682
Scott: I think that was it, you know, no running and no hitting people.

528
00:35:34,762 --> 00:35:39,423
Rym: and see now that's that's why I mean I love laser tag, but the way.

529
00:35:39,463 --> 00:35:40,690
Rym: well one laser tag is dead.

530
00:35:41,111 --> 00:35:42,996
Rym: Laser tag is like the deadest freaking.

531
00:35:43,056 --> 00:35:48,008
Scott: well outdoor laser tag still has something because they know but it's not where it doesn't.

532
00:35:48,269 --> 00:35:48,831
Rym: there are Two.

533
00:35:48,872 --> 00:35:50,301
Scott: there are a couple places.

534
00:35:50,321 --> 00:35:51,649
Scott: They're like two places to do it.

535
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:55,730
Rym: It's got the nearest laser tag place to us is like 40 miles away.

536
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:59,869
Scott: Oh, yeah, there's so few of them but you know, they're about as common as you know.

537
00:36:00,512 --> 00:36:02,961
Scott: Go-kart tracks, you know, there are a lot more go-karts.

538
00:36:03,021 --> 00:36:03,583
Scott: You think so?

539
00:36:03,644 --> 00:36:05,992
Scott: Yeah, I'm talking about real go-karts though Not the fake ones.

540
00:36:06,052 --> 00:36:11,733
Rym: plus remember laser tag like has had this long decline and a lot of the companies that make the equipment have Gone out of business.

541
00:36:11,834 --> 00:36:12,256
Scott: It's true.

542
00:36:12,316 --> 00:36:15,190
Rym: It's true and there's not that much demand for it.

543
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:17,009
Scott: I mean paintball and airsoft pushed him out.

544
00:36:17,231 --> 00:36:27,390
Rym: Well, the real problem was that all the ways to play laser tag that were fun for people like us We're not fun for the primary demographic which was nine-year-old birthday parties.

545
00:36:27,512 --> 00:36:28,048
Scott: That's true.

546
00:36:28,471 --> 00:36:41,071
Rym: so laser take like laser quest was always super lame like laser quest was the weakest laser tag for me because it's always like Every man for himself free-for-all and there's actually every man for himself free-for-all is better than some of the other ones I've done.

547
00:36:41,392 --> 00:36:57,843
Scott: I did a laser tag once that basically was like there's two bases on each side quote bases and you had to basically Get across the map without dying Right and if you know well map right room without dying and if you did die you had to go all the way back to your side to this one spot.

548
00:36:57,863 --> 00:36:59,249
Scott: that would bring you back to life right.

549
00:36:59,269 --> 00:37:20,590
Scott: and Once you got to the other side You got into one of these two corners and in the corners these tiny bases and you would sit in the tiny base shooting the little like target a tiny target constantly as much as you could to rack up as many points as you could for your Team until someone eventually came into your little, you know enemy base and shot you and he had to run all the way back here.

550
00:37:20,851 --> 00:37:24,167
Scott: So it was pretty much a whole lot of running back and forth and not a whole lot of shooting.

551
00:37:24,187 --> 00:37:25,593
Rym: people see But I like it.

552
00:37:25,613 --> 00:37:30,550
Rym: like cues are I like the fact that you had lives and the fact that the game cues?

553
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:32,746
Scott: I was more like an actual multiplayer.

554
00:37:32,766 --> 00:37:35,015
Rym: Yes yes, but that's what I'm talking about.

555
00:37:35,035 --> 00:37:42,302
Rym: the good the really good laser tag was few and far between because usually it was laser tag where It's a bunch of people kind of playing half-assed Lee.

556
00:37:42,544 --> 00:37:44,830
Rym: You're not allowed to run You're not allowed to climb.

557
00:37:45,111 --> 00:37:53,349
Rym: There's like people everywhere making sure you don't break the rules and you've got the six-year-old kid like holding his hand over his sensor Just like walking behind you shooting you in the back.

558
00:37:53,651 --> 00:37:56,203
Scott: Yeah, well, I mean, you know, that's the thing is whenever you.

559
00:37:56,545 --> 00:37:57,690
Scott: I think that's part of the problem.

560
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:58,615
Scott: Is that that the?

561
00:37:58,635 --> 00:38:01,410
Scott: I don't want a tangent here, right because we're go.

562
00:38:02,332 --> 00:38:10,050
Scott: but the part of the reason why the arcade failed in the US is because The people who would really keep an arcade going are serious gamers.

563
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:18,649
Scott: but most of the people who went to the arcade were non serious gamers, you know, like just kids having a birthday party or whatever and They did not mix.

564
00:38:18,836 --> 00:38:26,137
Scott: well it's like the serious gamer isn't gonna play laser tag when it's full of kids who aren't taking it seriously and are just Ruining it and sort of making it stupid

565
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:31,378
Rym: plus the fact that they dumb the game down to accommodate the fact that you know every 20 Minutes, they run a 15-minute game.

566
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,228
Rym: Yeah, so it's always like the 15-minute.

567
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:37,263
Rym: You can never die free-for-all as opposed to like the awesome cues are.

568
00:38:37,745 --> 00:38:38,528
Rym: All right, let's go.

569
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:42,696
Rym: two teams You know green and orange Bases six lives.

570
00:38:42,796 --> 00:38:45,187
Rym: if you run out of lives, you're fucking done.

571
00:38:45,287 --> 00:38:45,769
Scott: Go home.

572
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:50,116
Scott: Yeah, I mean when you can when you do that, right you're gonna get you know The birthday party crowd.

573
00:38:50,176 --> 00:38:55,945
Scott: but the birthday party crowd is gonna get bored of that eventually, you know They'll do laser tag for one birthday and that's it.

574
00:38:55,965 --> 00:38:58,662
Scott: They're never gonna do it again Not even that they won't even want to keep.

575
00:38:58,682 --> 00:38:59,730
Scott: you want to make a lot of money.

576
00:38:59,871 --> 00:39:03,870
Scott: You need to make it serious so that you have acts like a league and you have people coming constantly.

577
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:11,299
Scott: This is the bowling alleys, right bowling alleys are the only people that have sort of figured out this Physical space entertainment thing.

578
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:13,850
Scott: right you have the sit, you know the boat.

579
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:18,506
Scott: Yeah, the birthday party situation covered but you also have the league situation.

580
00:39:18,567 --> 00:39:19,530
Scott: serious people covered.

581
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:22,047
Scott: You've got to cover both and laser tag covered.

582
00:39:22,128 --> 00:39:26,770
Rym: neither There are laser tag places that do and those are the ones that have like these awesome thriving communities.

583
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:30,070
Rym: They're just aren't any anywhere near us or we would totally be a part of that.

584
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:33,183
Scott: I mean there are definitely some but they are very few and far between.

585
00:39:33,243 --> 00:39:33,424
Rym: Yes.

586
00:39:33,444 --> 00:39:34,890
Rym: They're not near us, right?

587
00:39:36,351 --> 00:39:38,401
Scott: Yeah, so that's that's the deal with.

588
00:39:38,421 --> 00:39:40,430
Scott: laser tag got ruined by the birthday party crowd.

589
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:49,021
Scott: Yeah, ball paintball never got really ruined by the birthday party crowd because it's sort of a thing that you wouldn't do unless you were Serious, you know, you're sort of afraid it's gonna hurt.

590
00:39:49,362 --> 00:39:56,210
Scott: or you know, it's not something kids do It's something that people who are sorta at least semi serious go and do you know?

591
00:39:56,210 --> 00:40:00,510
Scott: I guess there might be some sort of corporate paintball outings going on, you know stuff like that.

592
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:08,216
Scott: But you know people don't generally do paintball unless they actually want to do sort of a gun Combat kind of thing.

593
00:40:08,738 --> 00:40:11,489
Rym: but even then I mean every time I've done paintball like it's really fun.

594
00:40:12,312 --> 00:40:16,185
Rym: But I don't like the rules of paintball as most people play it.

595
00:40:16,305 --> 00:40:27,281
Rym: Yeah, most of the games of paintball I've seen or played they play like the very like all the very specific kinds of games that are in no way Reminiscent of combat or a simulation of combat or any.

596
00:40:27,321 --> 00:40:32,805
Rym: they're just basically this completely separate Specific game that happens to use paintball equipment.

597
00:40:33,489 --> 00:40:39,610
Scott: Mm-hmm Yeah, it's like they'll do say capture the flag, but you shoot people to get them out or speedball and all that.

598
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:45,490
Scott: Yeah, you know, they'll come up with some sort of rules or you know something along and then they're just using paintball gun.

599
00:40:45,671 --> 00:40:50,106
Rym: I remember specifically when I played paintball at RIT and I tried to use some tactics.

600
00:40:50,146 --> 00:40:51,190
Rym: I go to that guy next to me.

601
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:54,304
Rym: I'm like, alright you rush forward to that fortification.

602
00:40:54,324 --> 00:40:55,349
Rym: I will cover you.

603
00:40:55,891 --> 00:41:02,410
Rym: So he's like I'm like ready and I stick my gun over the barrier without looking and start just peppering the field.

604
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:04,600
Rym: You know, that's what military cover fire is in some cases.

605
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,730
Scott: Your balls are just landing in the grass not doing anything.

606
00:41:07,101 --> 00:41:18,072
Rym: Well, no I because it forces feet basically cover fire Forces the whatever is trying to shoot you to back down long enough for the person you were covering to get to the next place to hide Mm-hmm.

607
00:41:18,332 --> 00:41:28,245
Rym: and immediately the giraffe blows the whistle and stops the game and comes over and sights me for the fact that you're not allowed To shoot around a barrier without seeing around the barrier while you're shooting because you might hurt someone.

608
00:41:28,606 --> 00:41:31,670
Scott: Yeah Yeah, that's that's the problem.

609
00:41:32,052 --> 00:41:33,277
Rym: And then what that that would like?

610
00:41:33,297 --> 00:41:37,482
Rym: that was the beginning of it and the more I played like there were so many fiddly rules That it wasn't that fun.

611
00:41:37,887 --> 00:41:47,440
Scott: Yeah I mean the other thing is that you know If you're not serious about paintball if you just go to a paintball place and just you know Start playing rent some equipment go with all your friends or whatever.

612
00:41:48,002 --> 00:41:50,110
Scott: They don't crank the guns up all the way.

613
00:41:50,391 --> 00:41:51,338
Scott: You know, they're they're pretty.

614
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:54,516
Scott: they power them down, you know And that sort of makes it so.

615
00:41:54,537 --> 00:41:57,048
Scott: they won't hurt people or get your eye out or any, you know.

616
00:41:57,712 --> 00:42:00,870
Scott: But and they won't you know leave big welts on you or anything.

617
00:42:01,211 --> 00:42:09,026
Scott: But the fact is then you power it down the balls don't go very far and they're very inaccurate So you can't really aim very well over any sort of distance.

618
00:42:09,589 --> 00:42:20,269
Scott: So It's sort of like it's like what the fuck, you know I only have a limited number of balls here and I basically just wasted them all shooting at you even all the way over there Where it was impossible for me to hit you.

619
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:26,557
Rym: but it just seems like if there's a lot of spray and pray going on and the good guns just fire a lot faster and A lot better and I don't know.

620
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:27,542
Rym: paintballs cool.

621
00:42:27,562 --> 00:42:28,146
Rym: Don't get us wrong.

622
00:42:28,186 --> 00:42:30,376
Rym: I'm not like Disparaging your sport.

623
00:42:30,437 --> 00:42:32,529
Rym: I know we have paintball people who are like about to kill us.

624
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:34,394
Rym: Yeah, but I don't know.

625
00:42:34,715 --> 00:42:35,838
Rym: I feel like more and more.

626
00:42:36,259 --> 00:42:40,570
Rym: what I want is just counter-strike in the real world.

627
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:42,958
Scott: Well, I mean that's really what the thing is right.

628
00:42:42,998 --> 00:42:46,450
Scott: It's like FPS is you know have real guns and things right?

629
00:42:46,611 --> 00:43:06,690
Scott: Well simulations of real guns and Thus, they actually do a pretty good job of simulating, you know, the sort of combat situations that you you know What a what they're like fantasies that you want to fulfill right and that that satisfies, you know The the urge to have a combat situation, you know without actual risk, right?

630
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:08,179
Scott: Cuz no one actually wants real combat.

631
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:08,743
Scott: That's terrible.

632
00:43:09,588 --> 00:43:19,529
Scott: So If you want that sort of scenario Without the risk but by doing it with paintball you're sort of you're failing to fulfill the scenario.

633
00:43:19,549 --> 00:43:25,869
Rym: plus I've seen some paintball places that do objective based stuff like that But it there aren't that many of them as far as I can tell.

634
00:43:26,472 --> 00:43:31,850
Rym: Yeah, if you people know about more let me know but my ideal I feel like more and more.

635
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:36,170
Rym: I've just got to get into airsoft because I feel like that's the only place where I can get exactly what I want.

636
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:41,490
Scott: Yeah, so basically it people don't know right cuz not it's surprising how many people don't know airsoft.

637
00:43:42,131 --> 00:43:51,190
Scott: Airsoft is basically It's sort of like paintball and that you have guns and you shoot each other right and you you know Generate some sort of sport around that that idea.

638
00:43:52,152 --> 00:43:53,599
Scott: And of course, it's not real weapons.

639
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:57,579
Scott: They won't kill you or anything and you know, there's no bull It's not even it's less than BBs, right?

640
00:43:57,659 --> 00:43:59,809
Scott: But basically what it is is plastic BBs.

641
00:44:00,171 --> 00:44:11,350
Scott: They're about the size of a BB But they're made of plastic and they shoot pretty fast Like you could shoot through like a cardboard box of these things, but you can't shoot through someone's skin with them, right?

642
00:44:11,751 --> 00:44:15,365
Scott: If I shot you and it hit your skin, you would just go out fuck.

643
00:44:15,747 --> 00:44:16,590
Rym: Well, it depends.

644
00:44:16,711 --> 00:44:17,173
Rym: I mean you can.

645
00:44:17,434 --> 00:44:21,975
Rym: you can make an airsoft gun that will will hurt people about as much as Almost as much as a 22.

646
00:44:21,975 --> 00:44:24,124
Scott: you you could crank up the power.

647
00:44:24,144 --> 00:44:25,530
Scott: Well, no a 22 can kill someone.

648
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:37,479
Rym: This is not gonna make an airsoft gun that would kill some if you hit someone in the unprotected Eyeball or if you if you shot straight up the nose Going like 800 FPS or something, I guess.

649
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:38,603
Scott: but no it really.

650
00:44:38,623 --> 00:44:40,509
Scott: but you know, they're not gonna hurt.

651
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:44,570
Scott: You know, they will hurt but they it's very very difficult.

652
00:44:44,731 --> 00:44:55,644
Scott: If you are following basic and very simple you basically have to go out of your way to permanently injure someone You know in normal play with even, you know, read any sort of basic safety.

653
00:44:56,146 --> 00:45:02,289
Scott: No one's gonna get actually hurt they'll just they might feel pain when they get hit but they won't get hurt right.

654
00:45:02,309 --> 00:45:05,650
Scott: and The things you know, they're little plastic BBs.

655
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:10,348
Scott: they shoot straight sort of like the way real, you know, almost like the way real bullets shoot.

656
00:45:10,368 --> 00:45:15,624
Scott: and all the guns or most of the guns are actually modeled after real-world guns.

657
00:45:15,644 --> 00:45:28,447
Scott: so you can go and get like an airsoft mp5 and Except for the orange tip on the front, you know, which identifies it as not a real weapon It looks like an mp5 and fires about the same rate as an mp5.

658
00:45:28,487 --> 00:45:29,410
Scott: and they have the same thing.

659
00:45:29,410 --> 00:45:35,650
Scott: You can get an ak-47 or an m4, you know deagle or you know, whatever you want and you know.

660
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:49,514
Scott: Thus it is, you know, very good at fulfilling the simulation of combat cuz like you could go in with like You know a pistol at the hip and a shotgun on the back and a rifle in the hands and the ammo is small You know, it's like paintball.

661
00:45:49,534 --> 00:45:54,030
Scott: or you get this big bucket of balls that you know can you know get jammed all the time?

662
00:45:54,270 --> 00:45:56,300
Scott: And so, you know, it's just little plastic pellets.

663
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:58,250
Scott: You can just you know have a whole bunch of them.

664
00:45:58,331 --> 00:45:59,028
Scott: It's no problem.

665
00:45:59,191 --> 00:46:04,490
Rym: It just generally looks like a lot of fun and we always that we haven't done it But we always have this idea of buying a bunch of cheap airsoft gun.

666
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:06,861
Scott: I mean, it's really not as expensive as you would think.

667
00:46:07,464 --> 00:46:12,910
Rym: like what we can we're thinking We'll just buy like the cheapest crap like a bunch of pistols all around low velocity.

668
00:46:13,031 --> 00:46:16,090
Rym: So we don't have to get like armor or anything and just get basic safety equipment.

669
00:46:16,151 --> 00:46:18,170
Scott: Yeah, you need you basically need a face mask, you know.

670
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:20,570
Scott: So you don't get your eyes or your face or anything, right?

671
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:25,294
Scott: And you just need to have some amount of clothing covering your body Maybe some gloves.

672
00:46:25,575 --> 00:46:31,019
Scott: that way, you know, if you get hit in the leg instead of hitting your bare leg It hits some jeans and then you know, you're alright.

673
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:33,410
Rym: Yeah, but I figure we can just get these.

674
00:46:33,772 --> 00:46:36,330
Rym: There's a million like abandoned factories around.

675
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:41,590
Scott: Well, you really want to go to an actual airsoft place because I find any really near us.

676
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:43,567
Rym: There's that one lame paintball place near us.

677
00:46:43,809 --> 00:46:50,562
Scott: Yeah Well, I mean the thing is, you know, you don't have to go there all the time But you want to go there at least once because you'll learn a lot about.

678
00:46:50,602 --> 00:46:57,470
Scott: if you don't know about the airsoft or the paintball Or whatever you will learn a lot of the things you need to know from the people there who basically do it for a living.

679
00:46:57,876 --> 00:47:05,150
Scott: And once you learn it Then you can sort of go and find Abandoned factory, whatever and do it with your friends as long as there's no one there, you know

680
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:12,070
Rym: I can just imagine the police like coming into this warehouse and finding like 18 members of the front row crew having a shootout.

681
00:47:12,533 --> 00:47:20,929
Scott: Yeah with like mp5s and m4s and AKs We would be spending at least a night in jail.

682
00:47:22,171 --> 00:47:22,994
Rym: That might be worth it.

683
00:47:23,576 --> 00:47:28,953
Scott: Maybe you know, the thing is if you find it truly out of the way abandoned place They're never gonna.

684
00:47:29,113 --> 00:47:37,041
Scott: you know, one's gonna know it's not a problem, you know, your worst worry is like some, you know Stranger will come along and be like what the fuck.

685
00:47:37,081 --> 00:47:39,410
Scott: or maybe they'll you know, they'll get hit and you'll be like, oh shit.

686
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:41,660
Scott: Oh, yeah, that's something to worry about.

687
00:47:41,781 --> 00:47:43,770
Rym: Well, then you just got to make sure there are no witnesses.

688
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:48,170
Scott: Yeah, well, it's hard to get rid of witnesses and all you've got is guns the shoot plastic.

689
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:49,615
Scott: You pew-pew-pew-pew-pew-pew.

690
00:47:49,836 --> 00:47:50,819
Rym: Ah, stop it.

691
00:47:51,100 --> 00:48:01,177
Scott: You'll never tell the coppers pew-pew It hurts my ass He's broke the butt, all right, I

692
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:07,805
Rym: don't know I'm I'm feeling this more and more But maybe it's partly because right now I'm really stir-crazy because it's near the end of winter and

693
00:48:08,146 --> 00:48:08,307
Scott: I want

694
00:48:08,327 --> 00:48:09,814
Rym: to get outside and move Around again.

695
00:48:09,834 --> 00:48:11,122
Scott: I'll tell you what, let's this is summer.

696
00:48:11,142 --> 00:48:11,484
Scott: Let's do it.

697
00:48:11,524 --> 00:48:19,045
Rym: No matter what let's do it We'll find a place and all right The front row crew is getting into airsoft that it is hereby declared.

698
00:48:19,065 --> 00:48:20,730
Rym: there can be no shit talking.

699
00:48:21,254 --> 00:48:23,370
Rym: All right, all right we committed.

700
00:48:23,370 --> 00:48:26,382
Scott: Yeah, the thing is right that the one thing about airsoft right is.

701
00:48:26,422 --> 00:48:32,090
Scott: I know I don't know enough about it But I do know that they have electric guns that you know going battery power.

702
00:48:32,171 --> 00:48:40,856
Scott: Everyone says you want like the gas blowback gun yeah, and they also have ones that you know have like gas cartridges and it's like Which way should you go?

703
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:41,278
Scott: Really?

704
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:44,110
Rym: It's like everyone's told me just go with gas blowback.

705
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:49,810
Scott: Yeah, but I've also heard that like, you know, the gas is better, but I've also heard you know, the electric freaking works.

706
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:51,922
Scott: It's not you know, it's not like total crap.

707
00:48:51,982 --> 00:48:53,330
Scott: Well you so and it's way cheap.

708
00:48:53,490 --> 00:48:58,070
Scott: So if you're just you know, testing it out having a good, you know, get the electric you'll save a ton of money.

709
00:48:58,211 --> 00:49:01,270
Rym: Well to start I imagine we're gonna buy like the cheapest craft.

710
00:49:01,752 --> 00:49:03,380
Scott: I think we should rent then buy.

711
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,330
Scott: then, you know, it's like we should step it up.

712
00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:06,716
Scott: You know go to the place and rent.

713
00:49:07,018 --> 00:49:08,866
Scott: go to the place with our bought stuff.

714
00:49:09,308 --> 00:49:13,684
Scott: then You know keep using the shitty bought stuff until where we know better.

715
00:49:14,005 --> 00:49:15,270
Scott: then buy good stuff.

716
00:49:15,651 --> 00:49:21,315
Scott: Then keep using the good stuff and then you know, see if we get serious and such, you know Yeah, I'm standard progression.
