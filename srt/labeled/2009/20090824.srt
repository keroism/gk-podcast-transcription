1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,526
Scott: It's Monday, August 24th.

2
00:00:11,666 --> 00:00:12,168
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,348 --> 00:00:12,889
Rym: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:14,513
Scott: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,573 --> 00:00:17,300
Scott: Tonight, what if it was open-sourced?

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,917
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:33,009
Rym: Nothing beats a weekend at the beach.

8
00:00:35,331 --> 00:00:37,149
Scott: Uh... two weekends at the beach.

9
00:00:39,836 --> 00:00:40,862
Rym: I had a good weekend in Wildwood.

10
00:00:40,882 --> 00:00:42,070
Rym: It was just me and Emily and uh...

11
00:00:42,233 --> 00:00:42,970
Scott: Wasn't it a little bit rainy?

12
00:00:43,331 --> 00:00:44,181
Rym: No, it wasn't really.

13
00:00:44,201 --> 00:00:44,565
Rym: Not at all.

14
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:45,950
Scott: It was pretty rainy elsewhere.

15
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:51,290
Rym: The only problem was that we couldn't really swim so much when the lifeguards were on duty.

16
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:52,690
Scott: Because they kept kicking you out?

17
00:00:53,211 --> 00:00:55,929
Rym: They wouldn't let anyone into the water because there were like crazy waves.

18
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:58,970
Scott: So basically the lifeguards job was to keep everyone out of the water?

19
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:02,150
Rym: But the thing is, when the lifeguards weren't on duty, you could swim.

20
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,566
Rym: So we'd get there before the lifeguards came out and go swimming.

21
00:01:05,627 --> 00:01:06,310
Rym: And it was awesome.

22
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:08,077
Rym: Lifeguards come and make us stop.

23
00:01:08,398 --> 00:01:09,766
Rym: But then at five, the lifeguards leave.

24
00:01:09,806 --> 00:01:10,450
Rym: We go swimming again.

25
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,670
Rym: But Saturday, we go swimming for a while after the lifeguards leave.

26
00:01:13,831 --> 00:01:14,930
Scott: And then the beach patrol comes?

27
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:18,590
Rym: Well no, then a lifeguard comes along and they start yelling at everyone to get out of the water.

28
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:23,783
Rym: And the guy is announcing, "The ocean is closed for the evening.

29
00:01:24,605 --> 00:01:26,069
Rym: Do not swim in the

30
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:26,410
Rym: ocean.".

31
00:01:26,451 --> 00:01:27,410
Rym: So we get out of the water.

32
00:01:27,691 --> 00:01:29,650
Scott: And you wait until he leaves and go back in the water?

33
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:30,634
Rym: Yes, and everyone does.

34
00:01:30,654 --> 00:01:34,610
Rym: So all along the beach you see this wave of people coming out of the water as he yells at them.

35
00:01:34,951 --> 00:01:38,010
Rym: And going right back in as soon as he drives ten feet further down the beach.

36
00:01:38,831 --> 00:01:40,399
Rym: He went back and forth for a while.

37
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:42,770
Rym: And eventually we gave up and went home to get dinner.

38
00:01:43,152 --> 00:01:45,062
Scott: Well, you can't stay in the water forever.

39
00:01:45,082 --> 00:01:46,490
Scott: Especially when it gets dark and cold.

40
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:47,413
Rym: It wasn't dark yet.

41
00:01:47,473 --> 00:01:48,357
Rym: It never got cold.

42
00:01:48,397 --> 00:01:51,570
Rym: It was so hot, Scott Johnson's dad turned on the AC.

43
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:53,510
Scott: Holy shit!

44
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:54,396
Rym: Oh my God.

45
00:01:54,436 --> 00:01:56,008
Rym: I got in and I was like, "Why are all the windows

46
00:01:56,109 --> 00:01:56,210
Rym: shut?".

47
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:57,454
Scott: That was a mad powerful Eric.

48
00:01:57,514 --> 00:02:01,188
Scott: He has this crazy, it obviously looks crazy powerful.

49
00:02:01,228 --> 00:02:01,890
Scott: Is it crazy powerful?

50
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,317
Rym: Well, he turned it on at the bare minimum.

51
00:02:04,378 --> 00:02:05,863
Rym: And inside he didn't notice.

52
00:02:05,903 --> 00:02:07,068
Rym: He's like, "It doesn't feel like the AC is

53
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:07,248
Rym: on.".

54
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:11,050
Rym: Then you walk outside and realize it's 25 degrees warmer out there.

55
00:02:11,171 --> 00:02:12,830
Scott: The front porch was even intolerable.

56
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,349
Rym: The front porch was a little too hot to hang out on.

57
00:02:15,671 --> 00:02:17,742
Scott: Damn, that front porch even has a ceiling fan.

58
00:02:17,822 --> 00:02:18,908
Scott: It's such a great front porch.

59
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:19,210
Scott: Anyway.

60
00:02:19,711 --> 00:02:20,862
Rym: There were some surfers out there.

61
00:02:20,882 --> 00:02:21,589
Rym: It was good times.

62
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:25,799
Scott: Alright, so I got a little thing that is not personal.

63
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:30,790
Scott: But then I have a large personal revelation that was saved for the show.

64
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:31,331
Rym: A person?

65
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:32,176
Rym: Yeah, Scott wouldn't tell me.

66
00:02:32,237 --> 00:02:34,189
Rym: All he kept telling me was he's got something to say.

67
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,176
Scott: Well, first of all, so I walk out.

68
00:02:35,237 --> 00:02:36,103
Scott: There's a new guy at work.

69
00:02:36,143 --> 00:02:37,030
Scott: Whatever, he's a new guy at work.

70
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:42,925
Scott: So, I walk out of the office and I work like a few blocks north of Times Square.

71
00:02:42,945 --> 00:02:44,810
Scott: Basically, traffic is stopped.

72
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,478
Scott: And it's just people everywhere going, "Oh, no, no, no,

73
00:02:47,498 --> 00:02:47,618
Scott: no.".

74
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,810
Scott: Obviously, there's a famous person in the street.

75
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:53,779
Scott: So, I'm just like, "Oh, fuck.

76
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:54,281
Scott: Tourists.

77
00:02:54,301 --> 00:02:55,024
Scott: Get out of my way.

78
00:02:55,044 --> 00:02:55,867
Scott: Get out of my way.

79
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:56,369
Scott: God damn

80
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:56,430
Scott: it.".

81
00:02:56,834 --> 00:02:58,070
Rym: Did it end up being someone cool?

82
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:01,237
Scott: No, someone said that later.

83
00:03:01,317 --> 00:03:06,009
Scott: I was told on the tweets that Britney Spears is on the top of one of the tourist buses.

84
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:07,989
Scott: Uh-huh.

85
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:08,834
Scott: So, I'm just like,

86
00:03:08,894 --> 00:03:09,096
Scott: "Oh.".

87
00:03:09,176 --> 00:03:11,130
Scott: I looked and there were some people on top of one of the tourist buses.

88
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:11,849
Scott: Is she still even famous?

89
00:03:12,391 --> 00:03:13,275
Scott: I don't fucking know.

90
00:03:13,395 --> 00:03:14,721
Scott: All I know is I'm like, "Whatever.

91
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:15,986
Scott: These stupid, all these tourists.

92
00:03:16,026 --> 00:03:16,569
Scott: Everyone's just going

93
00:03:16,609 --> 00:03:16,750
Scott: woo.".

94
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:18,683
Scott: I'm like, "Do you even like Britney Spears?

95
00:03:18,743 --> 00:03:19,287
Scott: Why are you going

96
00:03:19,328 --> 00:03:19,408
Scott: woo?".

97
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:22,720
Scott: I mean, if I would have known it was her, I would have been like, "Bitch, you can't sing.

98
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,542
Scott: Everyone go home.

99
00:03:23,562 --> 00:03:23,823
Rym: Bitch can't

100
00:03:23,843 --> 00:03:23,923
Rym: sing.".

101
00:03:26,111 --> 00:03:29,150
Rym: Scott, I would wager that the majority of people in the crowd didn't know who was there either.

102
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,830
Rym: They were just going woo because other people were going woo.

103
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,370
Scott: Yeah, it was just really, it was incredibly annoying.

104
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,530
Rym: It's the real world woo game.

105
00:03:34,671 --> 00:03:36,220
Scott: So, here's the revelation.

106
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:36,884
Scott: Are you ready for this?

107
00:03:36,985 --> 00:03:37,830
Scott: This is a killer.

108
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:48,170
Rym: Is this, on the scale of, let's see, zero to ten, zero being, I don't know, Mars attacks, and ten being Steppenwolf, how much of a revelation was this?

109
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:49,430
Scott: I know, it's maybe nine.

110
00:03:49,975 --> 00:03:50,270
Scott: Really?

111
00:03:50,492 --> 00:03:51,170
Scott: Yeah, you ready for this?

112
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:51,597
Rym: I'm ready.

113
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:51,963
Rym: This is it.

114
00:03:53,351 --> 00:03:55,342
Scott: So, Emily will enjoy this as well.

115
00:03:55,362 --> 00:04:00,050
Rym: So, Rym- Is this like when you realized what the Beatles stood for?

116
00:04:00,251 --> 00:04:01,135
Scott: No, this is more than that.

117
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,768
Scott: This is personal and not otherwise, right?

118
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:04,930
Scott: All right.

119
00:04:05,171 --> 00:04:08,190
Scott: So, why does Scott not do any exercising?

120
00:04:08,812 --> 00:04:09,529
Rym: Because it hurts.

121
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:10,332
Scott: Because it hurts.

122
00:04:11,256 --> 00:04:15,055
Scott: But there are some exercises I can do like- I don't know.

123
00:04:15,075 --> 00:04:16,529
Rym: I've never seen you exert yourself.

124
00:04:16,951 --> 00:04:17,510
Scott: Well, swimming.

125
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:18,909
Rym: You can kind of swim.

126
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:22,610
Scott: And also, remember I said I could bicycle forever as long as it's flat?

127
00:04:22,871 --> 00:04:24,290
Rym: At like one mile an hour, but yeah.

128
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:25,733
Scott: Okay, anyway.

129
00:04:26,254 --> 00:04:31,550
Scott: So, I parked my car up on top of the hill on the street where I don't have to pay.

130
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:34,689
Scott: Well, you technically do have to pay, but I haven't been able to pay.

131
00:04:35,171 --> 00:04:37,709
Scott: But the train was coming, so I ran down the hill.

132
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,650
Scott: And you know, I don't have any asthma, right?

133
00:04:41,151 --> 00:04:45,370
Scott: And I don't have any other sorts of problems in that department, right?

134
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:50,070
Scott: But, you know, it hurts when I do any sort of exertions, right?

135
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:55,009
Scott: And no doctor has been able to tell me why forever.

136
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:59,410
Scott: Even though I think they probably would have if they would have put me on the treadmill with the sticky bits and such.

137
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:02,230
Rym: Because I did the treadmill sticky bit once in my childhood.

138
00:05:02,411 --> 00:05:04,370
Scott: I wanted to do it, but they never let me do it.

139
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:08,270
Scott: And I think they would have figured out why I could not do any exercising.

140
00:05:08,652 --> 00:05:09,036
Rym: All right.

141
00:05:09,258 --> 00:05:10,609
Rym: I'm really curious to hear.

142
00:05:11,091 --> 00:05:13,529
Scott: It took me 27 years to figure it out.

143
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:17,650
Rym: Because I'll point out that a lot of exercises, especially early on, does hurt a lot.

144
00:05:17,941 --> 00:05:18,109
Scott: No.

145
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:19,509
Rym: And it turns into not hurting.

146
00:05:19,672 --> 00:05:19,957
Scott: No.

147
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:20,589
Scott: You know why?

148
00:05:22,171 --> 00:05:27,450
Scott: I have a involuntary reflex when I exert myself, I hold my breath.

149
00:05:28,293 --> 00:05:29,889
Scott: And I went online to see if this was...

150
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:30,910
Rym: A lot of people have that.

151
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:34,270
Scott: I went online to see what it was called and I couldn't find what it was called.

152
00:05:34,672 --> 00:05:35,889
Scott: I just saw that people have it.

153
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:41,589
Scott: And basically I saw like, you know, martial arts people mostly saying, "Hey, don't hold your

154
00:05:41,609 --> 00:05:41,850
Scott: breath.".

155
00:05:41,971 --> 00:05:43,707
Scott: And it's like, "Well, that's not really helping

156
00:05:43,748 --> 00:05:43,869
Scott: me.".

157
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:44,660
Scott: Because then I'm like,

158
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:45,086
Scott: "Okay.".

159
00:05:45,552 --> 00:05:47,509
Scott: So as soon as I realized it, I was like, "Oh my

160
00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:47,670
Scott: God.".

161
00:05:47,892 --> 00:05:50,150
Scott: Because that totally, like, I can swim.

162
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:50,516
Scott: Why?

163
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,650
Scott: Because when you swim, you're supposed to hold your breath.

164
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:56,670
Rym: Well, because I think you have the weird instinct, like the broken instinct of hold breath.

165
00:05:56,791 --> 00:06:00,150
Rym: But in the water, there's the contrary instinct of don't drown.

166
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:00,669
Scott: That's the thing.

167
00:06:00,931 --> 00:06:06,469
Scott: Like if I run a long way, like when he ran with James and that little around the RIT thing.

168
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,050
Rym: Oh yeah, the Chase corporate challenge.

169
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:09,170
Scott: The Chase corporate challenge, right?

170
00:06:10,011 --> 00:06:17,149
Scott: I hold my breath, but you know, because, you know, and then eventually when I'm going to die, it's just your body makes you breathe, right?

171
00:06:17,492 --> 00:06:22,730
Scott: But basically because you held your breath and then ran a bunch, you're now wrecked and you can't do anything and you fall over.

172
00:06:23,312 --> 00:06:26,270
Scott: And that's why, you know, if I'm biking flat, I'm not exerting.

173
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:27,583
Scott: It's not, I'm not stressing, right?

174
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:31,110
Scott: But if I go up the hill, then I just fall over and die.

175
00:06:31,231 --> 00:06:35,030
Scott: Because as soon as I start going up the hill and I have to push hard, I start holding my breath.

176
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:37,930
Rym: See, because the thing is there are points where you hold your breath when you're exercising.

177
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:41,430
Rym: Like when you're lifting weights, there's points where you hold, points where you breathe out, breathe in.

178
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:42,841
Scott: I can't do a pushup.

179
00:06:42,921 --> 00:06:44,050
Scott: That's just because my arms are weak.

180
00:06:44,231 --> 00:06:47,404
Scott: But I can only try like once or twice before.

181
00:06:47,444 --> 00:06:51,370
Scott: I'm just like lying on the floor because while I'm pushing, I'm not breathing.

182
00:06:52,313 --> 00:06:56,366
Rym: So I tried to... You want to take some weights and while you're lifting, I'll just keep yelling,

183
00:06:56,467 --> 00:06:56,890
Rym: "Breathe!".

184
00:06:57,131 --> 00:06:59,810
Scott: I tried to consciously like breathe.

185
00:07:00,412 --> 00:07:01,306
Rym: Don't breathe.

186
00:07:01,327 --> 00:07:01,550
Scott: No more.

187
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:07,710
Scott: I was like, OK, I stopped on the hill on the way down and I'm like, OK, consciously breathe now that you've realized this, right?

188
00:07:08,451 --> 00:07:09,677
Scott: So I'm like, OK, I can.

189
00:07:09,777 --> 00:07:11,064
Scott: So I breathe in.

190
00:07:11,144 --> 00:07:11,727
Scott: I start running.

191
00:07:11,767 --> 00:07:12,350
Scott: I didn't breathe out.

192
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:12,925
Scott: I was like, fuck!

193
00:07:14,491 --> 00:07:16,381
Scott: So I don't, I don't know.

194
00:07:16,984 --> 00:07:18,690
Scott: I need some like... Here's what you need.

195
00:07:19,212 --> 00:07:22,690
Scott: A doctor couldn't diagnose me, but I need a doctor solution.

196
00:07:23,311 --> 00:07:26,270
Scott: I think that there has not been enough study in this area.

197
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:28,950
Rym: I think there's a fairly simple solution, but it would hurt at first.

198
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:36,598
Rym: You should take a martial art because in kung fu, you realize he would basically make us punch ourselves in the stomach and do all these hard exercises.

199
00:07:37,121 --> 00:07:38,329
Rym: And the whole time he would yell at us...

200
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:39,780
Scott: I can't punch myself in the stomach.

201
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,110
Scott: I'll get like an appendix explosion.

202
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:43,749
Rym: Well, that comes after you make the muscle a little stronger than nothing.

203
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:46,728
Scott: That's like halfway through the class.

204
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:47,697
Scott: I also have stomach problems.

205
00:07:47,778 --> 00:07:49,189
Scott: I need a non-stomach exercise.

206
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,982
Rym: But half of what he would do is force you.

207
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:58,290
Rym: He'd make you do exercises where you breathe in and breathe out in very specific rhythms based on what you're doing.

208
00:07:58,731 --> 00:08:01,970
Rym: And he would hit you if you weren't breathing in or breathing out at the right time.

209
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:04,590
Scott: I need, I need to hire the non-breather hitter.

210
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:05,512
Scott: Yeah.

211
00:08:05,532 --> 00:08:06,437
Rym: You know, you want me to hit you?

212
00:08:06,457 --> 00:08:07,120
Rym: I'll hit you.

213
00:08:10,932 --> 00:08:15,530
Scott: I also read, this is also very dangerous apparently because when I was searching for it, I didn't know what to search for.

214
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:17,710
Scott: I couldn't find any scientific word to describe it.

215
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:24,050
Scott: I'm searching for like not breathing while exerting or not breathing while exercising or not breathing while running.

216
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:30,230
Scott: And I couldn't, I found some people and I found people who had it and people who told you just basically the only advice is fucking breathe.

217
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,299
Scott: There wasn't any other helpful advice.

218
00:08:32,341 --> 00:08:33,486
Scott: And it's like, I tried that already.

219
00:08:33,506 --> 00:08:33,929
Scott: It didn't work.

220
00:08:34,552 --> 00:08:36,018
Scott: So I need something else.

221
00:08:36,118 --> 00:08:36,600
Scott: I don't know.

222
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,948
Scott: Or a word, you know, some, I don't know.

223
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:48,129
Rym: Well, there's definitely an instinct when you're not terribly, or you're doing something that's more exertion than your body's ready for to hold your breath during the exertion.

224
00:08:48,891 --> 00:08:51,970
Rym: So if you're continually exerting and you're not used to it.

225
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:59,590
Scott: Basically, if I try to do any exercise at all, I involuntarily hold my breath, use up all the oxygen in my body and then fall over and then breathe the whole bunch.

226
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:00,714
Rym: So you should come around.

227
00:09:00,975 --> 00:09:02,200
Rym: I'll pace you will run.

228
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,670
Rym: And every 10 seconds I'll say, Scott, breathe.

229
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,617
Scott: That's I need more than like 10 seconds.

230
00:09:06,637 --> 00:09:09,830
Scott: I need to like, you know, consciously breathe before I start moving.

231
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:11,115
Rym: Do you want me to make you an audio file?

232
00:09:11,155 --> 00:09:14,909
Rym: Just I need you to say, breathe in, breathe out.

233
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,194
Scott: I don't know.

234
00:09:17,118 --> 00:09:19,448
Scott: It didn't work because I told myself to breathe in and out.

235
00:09:19,468 --> 00:09:19,749
Scott: I didn't.

236
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:21,910
Rym: What if you have an audio tape telling you that?

237
00:09:22,031 --> 00:09:22,457
Scott: I don't know.

238
00:09:22,518 --> 00:09:23,228
Scott: I had to try it.

239
00:09:23,531 --> 00:09:24,236
Rym: I could follow you.

240
00:09:24,538 --> 00:09:26,350
Rym: I could follow you with like a 10 foot stick.

241
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,475
Rym: I just want to know why.

242
00:09:27,656 --> 00:09:31,010
Scott: I want to know why a doctor couldn't tell me this right.

243
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:35,970
Scott: You know, the doctor was like checking for like, you know, what's it called when your nose is bent out of shape?

244
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:37,370
Scott: Deviated septum?

245
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:37,511
Scott: Yeah.

246
00:09:37,531 --> 00:09:38,377
Scott: He's checking for that.

247
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:39,908
Scott: And he's checking for all this other stuff.

248
00:09:39,928 --> 00:09:40,130
Scott: Right.

249
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,599
Scott: No, they're checking for the asthma.

250
00:09:41,619 --> 00:09:42,486
Scott: I don't have any of that shit.

251
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:42,870
Scott: Right.

252
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,274
Scott: And he's like, I don't know.

253
00:09:44,675 --> 00:09:44,936
Scott: Right.

254
00:09:44,997 --> 00:09:48,830
Scott: But apparently this is common enough that I could find it on the Internet that a bunch of people have it.

255
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,034
Scott: But there's no word for it.

256
00:09:50,415 --> 00:09:54,530
Scott: A doctor can't tell you when it's you have the problem, I guess, without really investigating.

257
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:54,691
Scott: Right.

258
00:09:55,514 --> 00:09:58,465
Scott: And I don't think there's been enough study in this area at all.

259
00:09:58,525 --> 00:09:59,629
Scott: It could be a neurological thing.

260
00:09:59,649 --> 00:09:59,950
Scott: I don't know.

261
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:10,890
Scott: But it's apparently really dangerous because I was reading an article came up about like deep sea diver people and how they get wicked brain damage because they, you know, exert themselves like swimming while holding their breath for far too long.

262
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:14,630
Rym: Well, part of that is because of it's very different breathing scuba.

263
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,491
Scott: They also.

264
00:10:15,552 --> 00:10:15,692
Scott: Yeah.

265
00:10:15,712 --> 00:10:17,056
Scott: Well, well, no, no, no.

266
00:10:17,097 --> 00:10:20,668
Scott: I mean, deep sea divers like pearl diver types, not scuba.

267
00:10:20,688 --> 00:10:21,290
Scott: scuba is fine.

268
00:10:22,253 --> 00:10:23,597
Rym: Well, the thing about here's the thing.

269
00:10:23,617 --> 00:10:28,170
Rym: When your body passes out or you hold your breath for too long, the body forces you to breathe.

270
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:28,711
Scott: Yeah.

271
00:10:28,872 --> 00:10:31,057
Rym: If you're deep sea diving, you can breathe in.

272
00:10:31,739 --> 00:10:36,250
Scott: So you're talking about like deep sea divers like to hold their breath for like really long.

273
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:39,121
Scott: And it's, you know, getting Dane Brahmage.

274
00:10:39,382 --> 00:10:41,009
Scott: So I don't I don't think that's that's me.

275
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:46,710
Rym: Well, the thing is, sir, if you hold your breath for too long, your body will start breathing unless you're underwater.

276
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:47,552
Scott: Yeah.

277
00:10:47,753 --> 00:10:47,914
Rym: Yeah.

278
00:10:48,015 --> 00:10:50,230
Rym: The key is to not go underwater until you figure this out.

279
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:52,077
Scott: I like swimming more than anyway.

280
00:10:52,158 --> 00:10:52,660
Scott: But I have to.

281
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,970
Scott: I now I have to go and experiment and see what I can do.

282
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:59,510
Scott: But I would I think I don't know how much I can do because I tried that and it didn't work now.

283
00:11:00,011 --> 00:11:04,910
Scott: So I have to get some sort of help now that I at least think I know what the problem is.

284
00:11:05,151 --> 00:11:05,754
Scott: I don't know.

285
00:11:05,774 --> 00:11:06,960
Rym: No, I did at work at least.

286
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,930
Rym: I finally got knocked out of the ping pong tournament.

287
00:11:09,591 --> 00:11:12,390
Scott: And you've got back into the winner's bracket or you're losing the loser's bracket.

288
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,593
Rym: I made it a little bit further.

289
00:11:13,733 --> 00:11:20,090
Rym: And then I eventually lost in the loser's bracket to to someone who was really good, who was knocked out by the guy who knocked me out right away.

290
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:20,990
Scott: OK.

291
00:11:21,452 --> 00:11:28,470
Rym: And those two was a close match in the loser's bracket, though the loser's bracket finals, at least I got pretty far in the loser's bracket.

292
00:11:29,353 --> 00:11:32,867
Rym: But then the one I finally fought was basically like the second best person.

293
00:11:33,189 --> 00:11:33,390
Scott: OK.

294
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:34,293
Rym: So I lost by.

295
00:11:34,313 --> 00:11:36,923
Scott: you're not you're not the second best or the first.

296
00:11:36,983 --> 00:11:38,630
Rym: No, but I'm definitely in the top 10.

297
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:41,470
Rym: And there are like 30 people who play ping pong regularly in the company.

298
00:11:41,831 --> 00:11:42,495
Rym: Oh, OK.

299
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,117
Rym: I'm doing OK.

300
00:11:43,138 --> 00:11:45,308
Scott: But I played again as a friend.

301
00:11:45,328 --> 00:11:45,790
Scott: It's pretty big.

302
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:46,452
Scott: Thirty people.

303
00:11:46,492 --> 00:11:48,259
Scott: I mean, I played against my floor.

304
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:51,029
Rym: Boss's boss and I beat him.

305
00:11:51,531 --> 00:11:53,037
Scott: Was that the boss of all bosses?

306
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:54,463
Rym: No, he's just the boss's boss.

307
00:11:54,563 --> 00:11:56,250
Scott: So there's a boss's boss's boss.

308
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:57,316
Rym: Well, yeah, he's a V.P.

309
00:11:57,457 --> 00:12:01,257
Rym: So there's only one level above the V.P So you're so you played one.

310
00:12:01,317 --> 00:12:04,170
Scott: You played someone who was one level below the top boss.

311
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:04,531
Scott: Yes.

312
00:12:04,712 --> 00:12:04,993
Scott: OK.

313
00:12:05,073 --> 00:12:07,180
Rym: And I beat him by using tricky English.

314
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:10,150
Rym: He was trash talking up a motherfucking storm.

315
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:12,062
Scott: Let me tell you, that's how that's how he gets to be.

316
00:12:12,123 --> 00:12:12,888
Rym: where he comes in.

317
00:12:13,552 --> 00:12:14,756
Rym: He puts on a headband.

318
00:12:15,138 --> 00:12:16,162
Rym: He starts swearing.

319
00:12:16,222 --> 00:12:16,965
Scott: He's ready to go.

320
00:12:16,985 --> 00:12:18,230
Scott: It's like, fuck you.

321
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,053
Scott: I'm going to fuck you up.

322
00:12:19,675 --> 00:12:19,956
Rym: Yeah.

323
00:12:20,237 --> 00:12:23,650
Rym: And so all I did was just backspin, backspin, backspin, backspin, backspin, backspin.

324
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:24,131
Rym: And I won.

325
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,963
Scott: Yeah, that's good stuff.

326
00:12:27,123 --> 00:12:28,790
Scott: You know, that's a good boss when he's back.

327
00:12:30,111 --> 00:12:34,446
Rym: Trash talk is pretty much one of the few indicators of a solid human being.

328
00:12:34,646 --> 00:12:34,867
Rym: Yes.

329
00:12:35,108 --> 00:12:35,750
Rym: Or an asshole.

330
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:36,971
Scott: Same thing.

331
00:12:37,012 --> 00:12:37,293
Scott: Yeah.

332
00:12:37,635 --> 00:12:39,584
Rym: It's already gotten the news.

333
00:12:40,086 --> 00:12:40,468
Scott: Oh, shit.

334
00:12:40,508 --> 00:12:40,890
Scott: What was it?

335
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:41,611
Scott: All right.

336
00:12:41,651 --> 00:12:42,613
Scott: So Wikipedia.

337
00:12:42,874 --> 00:12:43,154
Scott: Right.

338
00:12:43,235 --> 00:12:49,470
Scott: Is actually, believe it or not, they're going to exert some editorial control on Wikipedia.

339
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:53,130
Rym: Well, they've done a few things like that in the past.

340
00:12:53,210 --> 00:13:00,590
Scott: So what they're doing basically is if there is any modification to a page of a famous person on the English site.

341
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,294
Rym: Oh, they've already had policies like that.

342
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:02,655
Rym: No, no.

343
00:13:03,055 --> 00:13:09,470
Scott: The change has to be approved by a certain change will not show up on the site at all.

344
00:13:09,751 --> 00:13:10,031
Scott: Right.

345
00:13:10,091 --> 00:13:16,710
Scott: Until it'll until a like Wikipedia approved person goes and like puts the OK on.

346
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:26,068
Scott: It's like if you go to a famous person's page and put in like, you know, this person, I don't know, raves baby was in Times Square today making Scott's life slightly difficult.

347
00:13:26,289 --> 00:13:26,530
Scott: Right.

348
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:27,596
Rym: Same as raping baby.

349
00:13:27,696 --> 00:13:27,938
Scott: Right.

350
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,850
Scott: Then that won't appear on Wikipedia.

351
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:43,535
Scott: Everyone will see the old unedited page and then a good Wikipedia approved person will come in, see that and sort of click the green checkbox if it's good or click the red checkbox or the red X. About time, you know, no good.

352
00:13:43,555 --> 00:13:54,970
Rym: I was thinking in general Wikipedia should have for certain kinds of scientific articles and things that are pretty objective, have a way to have the kind of certified version of the page and then updates, updates, updates, updates.

353
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:57,683
Rym: But you can look at the current version or the certified version.

354
00:13:57,823 --> 00:13:57,984
Scott: Yeah.

355
00:13:58,024 --> 00:13:59,230
Scott: Like the dev and the stable.

356
00:13:59,410 --> 00:13:59,490
Rym: Yeah.

357
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:03,366
Rym: Like certified by some expert in the field, maybe a consortium, something like that.

358
00:14:03,547 --> 00:14:03,748
Scott: Yeah.

359
00:14:03,788 --> 00:14:04,210
Scott: Something long.

360
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,814
Scott: You know, it's not it's not the worst.

361
00:14:06,075 --> 00:14:10,510
Scott: The thing is, I wonder, I wonder if trade ideals for pragmatism.

362
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:10,791
Rym: Yeah.

363
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:18,890
Scott: I wonder if the the people who, though, are doing the green check in the red X flags, you know, know enough for this.

364
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,415
Scott: Like, are they going to pay these people?

365
00:14:20,455 --> 00:14:24,410
Scott: What if, you know, I make a change to a famous person's page, but they're not that famous.

366
00:14:24,812 --> 00:14:27,650
Scott: And no one ever comes to give me the green check, even though it's true.

367
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:34,030
Rym: There was another article a while ago about how the Wikipedia community, now that all the trivial additions are done, has really slowed down.

368
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:39,230
Rym: And there is a very small core of very dedicated professionals and almost no one else contributes anymore.

369
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:41,395
Scott: Because it's very difficult to find something to contribute.

370
00:14:41,455 --> 00:14:47,169
Scott: I mean, if there's a news art, if there's a news item, it gets immediately like immediately someone dies book page updated.

371
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:47,390
Scott: Right.

372
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:59,070
Rym: So it's like, what can you possibly do unless, you know, talk about stuff that you're like the expert on or do what I do, which more people need to do, which is just go through every time you find a grammar or like typo mistake, anything like that.

373
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,653
Rym: Just fix it anonymously.

374
00:15:00,873 --> 00:15:01,074
Rym: Yeah.

375
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:01,795
Scott: That's what I most.

376
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:08,350
Scott: the only big changes I ever make to Wikipedia are like when I go read an article about something and I see something blatantly wrong.

377
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,860
Scott: And I just go and, you know, fix do the little fixes.

378
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,024
Scott: I can't write a whole article.

379
00:15:12,065 --> 00:15:13,370
Scott: There's no whole article for me to write.

380
00:15:14,011 --> 00:15:19,923
Rym: I used to go out and attack certain pseudoscientific articles and basically it's not worth the effort.

381
00:15:20,404 --> 00:15:21,146
Rym: I won.

382
00:15:21,727 --> 00:15:23,110
Rym: I won some of my battles.

383
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:27,823
Rym: But the baby one last I checked the Indigo Children article was OK.

384
00:15:27,883 --> 00:15:29,448
Rym: Thanks largely to me.

385
00:15:29,468 --> 00:15:30,130
Rym: Good job.

386
00:15:30,731 --> 00:15:32,757
Rym: Basically, I went in to save some indigo.

387
00:15:32,837 --> 00:15:37,250
Rym: I went in every couple of weeks and added the word allegedly in front of almost every sentence.

388
00:15:41,251 --> 00:15:42,814
Scott: OK, so any news over there?

389
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:50,050
Rym: Of course, I want to point out that part of the reason they're probably doing this and they used to have a similar policy, not with the holding back the.

390
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:53,459
Scott: Because you can get slandered, liable for this kind of stuff.

391
00:15:53,499 --> 00:15:57,590
Rym: They have a very strong policy about articles about individual people who are still alive.

392
00:15:57,871 --> 00:15:58,111
Scott: Yeah.

393
00:15:58,653 --> 00:15:58,853
Scott: Yeah.

394
00:15:59,154 --> 00:16:04,730
Rym: But I want to talk a little bit about parking meters in Chicago because this is a really bad story.

395
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:12,607
Rym: Basically, the city of Chicago purchased a 75 year lease on so-called smart, user friendly parking machine.

396
00:16:12,627 --> 00:16:13,849
Scott: Same kind of have in New York City.

397
00:16:14,851 --> 00:16:16,817
Rym: Kind of from Morgan Stanley.

398
00:16:17,078 --> 00:16:17,379
Scott: All right.

399
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,202
Scott: Morgan Stanley.

400
00:16:18,242 --> 00:16:19,024
Scott: Isn't that a financial.

401
00:16:19,265 --> 00:16:20,710
Rym: Well, a Morgan Stanley consortium.

402
00:16:21,111 --> 00:16:24,699
Scott: OK, so basically they bought this to be a better choice.

403
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:28,326
Rym: They bought the 75 year lease on these parking machines that everyone.

404
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:29,910
Scott: they leased the machines.

405
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:30,792
Rym: That's common.

406
00:16:31,093 --> 00:16:37,610
Rym: OK, but basically the machines suck and everyone agrees that they're terrible and they're a waste of money.

407
00:16:37,971 --> 00:16:39,575
Rym: They're like there's a gigantic scandal.

408
00:16:39,595 --> 00:16:40,297
Rym: They didn't check out.

409
00:16:40,358 --> 00:16:44,670
Scott: So that probably it was probably a lowest bidder situation where they didn't check the, you know, the quality.

410
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:45,011
Scott: Well, no.

411
00:16:45,051 --> 00:16:46,936
Rym: Part of the problem is that the machines get this.

412
00:16:46,997 --> 00:16:51,670
Rym: So now if you want to park in these areas where they use these machines in Chicago, you have to park on the street.

413
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:52,151
Rym: OK.

414
00:16:52,332 --> 00:16:55,580
Rym: Walk like four blocks over to these little boxes.

415
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,202
Rym: That's too far.

416
00:16:56,242 --> 00:16:57,084
Scott: You need one in every block.

417
00:16:57,104 --> 00:16:58,027
Rym: There aren't that many of them.

418
00:16:58,328 --> 00:16:58,949
Scott: That's not enough.

419
00:16:59,009 --> 00:16:59,110
Scott: OK.

420
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,957
Rym: Some of them are only a half a block away.

421
00:17:00,977 --> 00:17:01,781
Rym: It's still a ways though.

422
00:17:01,801 --> 00:17:02,484
Scott: It depends where you park.

423
00:17:02,504 --> 00:17:03,649
Scott: I mean, you could park right next to it.

424
00:17:03,669 --> 00:17:03,830
Scott: Right.

425
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:12,109
Rym: And then you've got to, you know, type in your stuff and put your money in, get a receipt, put it in your window, go back to your car and put it in the window.

426
00:17:12,371 --> 00:17:12,531
Scott: Yeah.

427
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:13,734
Scott: That's what the New York City knew.

428
00:17:13,836 --> 00:17:14,979
Scott: the ones in New York City.

429
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:15,903
Scott: They do the same thing.

430
00:17:15,943 --> 00:17:18,089
Scott: The thing is, this box is all over the place.

431
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:22,219
Rym: The ones you want on the same block, the ones in New York City are a lot older.

432
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:26,270
Rym: And I note that in smart cities that old, there are old compared to these brand new ones.

433
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:26,810
Scott: OK.

434
00:17:27,132 --> 00:17:29,339
Rym: Plus, New York's had the system for a while, a little while.

435
00:17:29,379 --> 00:17:32,710
Scott: But I mean, New York had just plain old quarter in the meter for like fucking ever.

436
00:17:33,331 --> 00:17:33,492
Rym: Yeah.

437
00:17:33,512 --> 00:17:36,583
Rym: A long time ago, they moved into those boxes less than like a decade ago.

438
00:17:36,603 --> 00:17:38,250
Rym: That's a long time in this sort of thing.

439
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:38,731
Rym: Yeah.

440
00:17:38,972 --> 00:17:44,710
Rym: Anyway, what a lot of smart cities do is just have machines where you type in the space number.

441
00:17:45,371 --> 00:17:45,611
Scott: Yeah.

442
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,016
Scott: That's how the train station here does it.

443
00:17:47,256 --> 00:17:49,724
Scott: But I think that what they should do is not the space number.

444
00:17:50,005 --> 00:17:51,610
Scott: You should type in your license plate.

445
00:17:52,031 --> 00:17:55,581
Rym: Actually, that is what every other civilized country does on your cell phone.

446
00:17:55,601 --> 00:17:58,870
Rym: You text in you make an account and you text in like your license plate.

447
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,857
Scott: What if I don't have a cell phone?

448
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:01,721
Rym: You know what?

449
00:18:01,741 --> 00:18:02,162
Rym: Screw you.

450
00:18:02,383 --> 00:18:02,885
Scott: That's right.

451
00:18:03,608 --> 00:18:04,090
Scott: We need to start.

452
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:09,410
Scott: You know, we need to start if we want people to adapt to modern technology, that is that will help them.

453
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:15,230
Scott: You know, it's like people have this thing where they won't get a technology until they need it.

454
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:15,551
Scott: Right.

455
00:18:15,611 --> 00:18:18,342
Scott: But at the same time, they don't need it until they have it.

456
00:18:18,402 --> 00:18:20,390
Scott: Like, for example, you know, I always use the same example.

457
00:18:20,711 --> 00:18:23,424
Scott: Someone lives in a small town and they say, I don't need a car.

458
00:18:23,484 --> 00:18:24,710
Scott: Everything is in the walking distance.

459
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:25,091
Scott: Right.

460
00:18:25,331 --> 00:18:27,838
Scott: But if they had a car, they would leave town.

461
00:18:28,198 --> 00:18:34,616
Scott: And if they left town, then after seeing what was outside the town that they never left before, they would want to leave the town.

462
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:38,370
Scott: And thus now they only need the car after they've had the car.

463
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:38,711
Scott: Right.

464
00:18:38,912 --> 00:18:41,781
Scott: It's like you only need the cell phone after you've had it.

465
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:44,570
Scott: You have to have it first before you realize that you need it.

466
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:50,950
Scott: And so I think we need to find any way possible to make people need technology that they don't think they need.

467
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:54,463
Rym: But at the same time, if their lives are working fine, do we need to change them?

468
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:55,728
Rym: Yeah.

469
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:56,190
Rym: Why?

470
00:18:56,691 --> 00:18:58,990
Scott: Because it's better for them and they just don't know better is bad medicine.

471
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:06,350
Rym: But at the same time, by having these magic wizard powers that not everyone has, we're basically in this separate, wonderful world.

472
00:19:06,692 --> 00:19:09,204
Rym: And by keeping people out of it, we just maintain our lives.

473
00:19:09,224 --> 00:19:10,510
Scott: You don't want to help the people.

474
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:11,756
Scott: You just want to dominate the people.

475
00:19:11,937 --> 00:19:12,319
Rym: I don't know.

476
00:19:12,379 --> 00:19:14,370
Scott: I'm just putting this difference in you and me.

477
00:19:14,631 --> 00:19:15,354
Rym: I'm putting forward.

478
00:19:15,374 --> 00:19:18,810
Scott: I want to empower all the peoples because that makes it you know, the more people using it.

479
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:26,090
Rym: The more fundamental problem here with these parking to reach the critical mass in general is that there is a huge problem in like upstate New York.

480
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:33,130
Rym: And by upstate, I mean like the 30 miles north of Yonkers where these all these little small towns along the Hudson and they don't have enough parking.

481
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:35,119
Rym: And a lot of small towns don't have enough parking.

482
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:35,863
Scott: A lot of places.

483
00:19:36,024 --> 00:19:37,290
Scott: Boston doesn't have enough parking.

484
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:40,618
Rym: Well, I'm not only talking about small towns right now, but they have.

485
00:19:40,698 --> 00:19:43,386
Rym: they don't have enough parking and they want to like.

486
00:19:43,406 --> 00:19:44,990
Rym: the root problem is not enough parking.

487
00:19:45,191 --> 00:19:52,670
Rym: And they want to encourage people from out of town to come in, park for like a couple hours, shop, put money in the community and then leave.

488
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,281
Rym: They don't want residents parking there.

489
00:19:55,321 --> 00:19:57,270
Rym: They don't want anyone in the town parking there.

490
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:01,050
Rym: And they don't want anyone parking there because they have an apartment nearby or parking long term.

491
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:10,350
Rym: So they make they're making ever increasingly technological hurdles to using the parking spaces, things like pressure plates that determine.

492
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,395
Rym: All right, I've parked here.

493
00:20:11,616 --> 00:20:14,230
Rym: I pay for like my four hours, which is the minimum I can pay for.

494
00:20:15,432 --> 00:20:18,570
Rym: I'm not allowed to put more money in without moving my car.

495
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:21,020
Rym: And if I move my car for hours and it will.

496
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,170
Rym: But if I move my car, the meter resets to zero.

497
00:20:23,451 --> 00:20:23,712
Scott: Yeah.

498
00:20:24,013 --> 00:20:27,410
Rym: So if I park for 15 minutes just to go to the dry cleaner, I got to pay for four hours.

499
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:30,443
Rym: The person who comes after me can't use the rest of my time.

500
00:20:30,503 --> 00:20:30,925
Rym: It's gone.

501
00:20:30,946 --> 00:20:31,730
Rym: And the city gets the money.

502
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:32,331
Scott: Yeah.

503
00:20:33,172 --> 00:20:45,130
Rym: And there are a ton of small towns that are basically using technology with parking meters and more and more advanced technology to solve the wrong problem or to generate revenue streams.

504
00:20:45,431 --> 00:20:47,939
Rym: And only in the end make things worse for everyone living in.

505
00:20:47,959 --> 00:20:49,163
Scott: this is this is true.

506
00:20:49,183 --> 00:20:51,330
Scott: However, I recently read this article.

507
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:52,073
Scott: I got to read more.

508
00:20:52,093 --> 00:20:53,380
Rym: You bring this article up all the time.

509
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,184
Rym: I can actually read it.

510
00:20:54,225 --> 00:20:55,150
Scott: What do you mean all the time?

511
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:56,093
Rym: You've brought this up a lot.

512
00:20:56,113 --> 00:21:01,050
Rym: The article about how parking if we actually took into account what parking spaces cost.

513
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:04,383
Scott: Yeah, I think there's actually a book about it called like parking isn't?

514
00:21:04,503 --> 00:21:04,885
Scott: I forget what?

515
00:21:04,905 --> 00:21:06,170
Scott: I'm going to find the link and show it to you.

516
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:14,790
Scott: But basically this guy, he said his whole thesis is that the actual cost of parking is like ludicrous.

517
00:21:15,031 --> 00:21:16,254
Rym: It depends on where you are.

518
00:21:16,294 --> 00:21:21,890
Rym: You realize, of course, it depends where you are in the Midwest or in towns that are made new recently.

519
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:24,690
Rym: Parking is effectively free because that line wouldn't be used for anything anyway.

520
00:21:25,531 --> 00:21:32,190
Scott: But he just talks about the actual cost of a parking space, you know, and I'm sure it's very detailed if you wrote a whole book about it.

521
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:40,050
Scott: And you know how even when people charge for parking, they're not charging anywhere even remotely close to the actual cost of the space.

522
00:21:40,431 --> 00:21:47,690
Scott: And it's actually, it turns out that when you look at the math, there's actually this gigantic government subsidy on parking because of the way it works out.

523
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:48,834
Rym: Well, Scott, here's the question though.

524
00:21:49,095 --> 00:21:52,830
Rym: If they're not charging enough, how come parking garages make crazy tons of money?

525
00:21:53,311 --> 00:21:55,570
Scott: I'm just saying is that that's what this guy says.

526
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:56,830
Rym: But how do they make so much money?

527
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:59,390
Scott: He says it's effectively a government subsidy on parking.

528
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:02,636
Scott: I'm curious how though because- I'm just saying what he says.

529
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:03,840
Scott: I'm not saying I agree with it.

530
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,523
Scott: What are you asking me?

531
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:06,510
Scott: I just read like a synopsis of his thing.

532
00:22:06,719 --> 00:22:06,909
Scott: I know.

533
00:22:07,131 --> 00:22:08,418
Scott: I didn't read the whole thing.

534
00:22:08,438 --> 00:22:10,470
Scott: You're attacking me like I'm the guy.

535
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,150
Rym: Well, because you brought this article up more than once.

536
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,273
Scott: I'm just bringing it up.

537
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:15,961
Scott: I'm not saying I agree with it or that I know about it.

538
00:22:16,042 --> 00:22:18,830
Scott: I'm just saying that this guy's out there and this is what he says.

539
00:22:19,311 --> 00:22:28,934
Rym: I'm just pointing out that the fact that I can come up with a couple of I think pretty smart refutations immediately and out of nothing means that- I'm not disagreeing with your refutations.

540
00:22:28,994 --> 00:22:33,485
Scott: I'm just saying there's a whole book and I'm sure that there are things in that book because I didn't read it.

541
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:35,410
Scott: that said probably answer your questions.

542
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,710
Scott: Or at least are bad answers to your questions.

543
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:46,750
Rym: The point I wanted to really bring up with this article is that, and we see this a lot, that people will seek technological solutions to the wrong problems.

544
00:22:47,430 --> 00:23:02,230
Rym: And when those solutions do not solve what they're actually trying to solve and they solve some other problem, they will continue to invest in the sunk cost of the wrong solution to the wrong problem trying to fix the root problem they could never possibly fix.

545
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:06,963
Rym: It's like trying to make a line, like a wire between two poles, be perfectly horizontal.

546
00:23:07,284 --> 00:23:09,210
Rym: It is 100% mathematically and physically impossible.

547
00:23:10,011 --> 00:23:12,729
Rym: But yet they keep pulling harder and harder and harder on those poles.

548
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:15,110
Rym: And I don't know what to do about it.

549
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:16,856
Scott: Well, you know how you could do it though.

550
00:23:17,277 --> 00:23:21,530
Scott: You could have a third, taller pole that sort of lifts the wire up- But then it's not horizontal.

551
00:23:22,054 --> 00:23:22,389
Scott: What do you mean?

552
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:23,472
Rym: Alright, Scott.

553
00:23:23,492 --> 00:23:27,810
Rym: So now you've got two horizontal wires that are each bowing slightly in the center.

554
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:30,093
Rym: Ah.

555
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:32,749
Scott: You know what you could do though?

556
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:33,609
Rym: Ten poles.

557
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:34,652
Scott: No, no, no, no.

558
00:23:34,692 --> 00:23:41,010
Scott: You could have just, you know, you could do like a suspension bridge and basically the wire that you want to be horizontal will be like the suspension bridge.

559
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:46,770
Scott: You want to have a- You'd have all these cables just suspending tiny segments of the actual cable itself.

560
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:48,056
Rym: Scott, you know what the real answer is?

561
00:23:48,338 --> 00:23:49,605
Rym: It's okay to let it dip in the middle.

562
00:23:49,626 --> 00:23:50,390
Rym: It doesn't hurt anything.

563
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:51,815
Scott: Here's another solution.

564
00:23:52,137 --> 00:23:52,881
Scott: Don't use a cable.

565
00:23:52,941 --> 00:23:54,067
Scott: Use like a steel beam.

566
00:23:54,107 --> 00:23:54,690
Scott: that's straight.

567
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:56,730
Rym: Those dip a little bit in the center.

568
00:23:57,075 --> 00:23:57,286
Rym: No.

569
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:58,024
Scott: Yeah, they do.

570
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,530
Scott: You got a big old I-beam and just lay it down across two poles.

571
00:24:01,793 --> 00:24:02,809
Rym: Some minuscule amount.

572
00:24:03,536 --> 00:24:04,147
Scott: Oh, come on.

573
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:05,428
Rym: Technically, yeah?

574
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,208
Scott: Yeah, okay, whatever.

575
00:24:06,614 --> 00:24:06,870
Rym: Tiny bit.

576
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:07,967
Rym: Microns.

577
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:09,150
Rym: Sub-microns.

578
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,235
Scott: Yeah, okay, yeah, okay.

579
00:24:10,255 --> 00:24:11,159
Scott: You want to play that game?

580
00:24:11,179 --> 00:24:12,003
Scott: You want to play that game?

581
00:24:12,365 --> 00:24:13,310
Scott: Poop just went in your mouth.

582
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:14,772
Rym: Well, no.

583
00:24:14,812 --> 00:24:18,790
Rym: You see, there were two XK CDs about that and two wonder marks about that.

584
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:19,816
Scott: Yeah, okay.

585
00:24:19,856 --> 00:24:21,469
Scott: So let's continue with this show.

586
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:28,630
Rym: But it's more that people will engage in futile behavior and they'll blame the technology as opposed to their poor use of the technology.

587
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:29,069
Rym: That's true.

588
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:36,490
Rym: And aside from that, the only reason we can't have nice parking meters is because not everyone has nice phones in America.

589
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,710
Rym: And even people who do don't know how to use their phones.

590
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:46,670
Rym: And it's kind of like how we can assume that any adult who is a productive member of society has a credit card and a bank account.

591
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:47,768
Rym: You can just assume that.

592
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:56,450
Rym: And anyone who doesn't have both of those things kind of exists in this pseudo-economy that's underneath the main economy and usually doesn't interact with it directly.

593
00:24:56,831 --> 00:25:00,138
Scott: Funny story, my brother's car, he was driving, he got hit.

594
00:25:00,178 --> 00:25:01,140
Scott: You know what it was?

595
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,827
Scott: A guy with no license, not a U.S.

596
00:25:04,867 --> 00:25:06,130
Scott: citizen, no insurance.

597
00:25:06,835 --> 00:25:07,829
Rym: It happens a lot.

598
00:25:08,771 --> 00:25:13,670
Scott: And the guy's brother who spoke English offered to just fix it and make it go away, but my brother just called the police.

599
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:14,287
Rym: That's what I would do.

600
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:15,389
Scott: Just had to take care, you know.

601
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:19,070
Rym: That's why I pay for supplemental, you know, I don't even have collision on my car.

602
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:21,309
Scott: Oh, collision's like the one that you're probably going to use.

603
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,689
Rym: No, but I don't pay for it because I'm not going to hit anyone and I'll assume.

604
00:25:25,092 --> 00:25:26,588
Scott: You don't care about your piece of shit car.

605
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:28,530
Scott: If you had a new car, you'd get the collision.

606
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:31,470
Rym: What I do pay for is supplementary uninsured motorists.

607
00:25:32,413 --> 00:25:33,650
Scott: That's the most important.

608
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:37,290
Rym: If anyone uninsured hits my car, they're fucked and I'm covered.

609
00:25:37,572 --> 00:25:37,826
Scott: That's right.

610
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:39,450
Rym: Alright.

611
00:25:40,231 --> 00:25:41,708
Rym: But there's this whole problem where...

612
00:25:41,991 --> 00:25:43,209
Scott: You're saying the same thing over and over again.

613
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:45,050
Rym: No, the whole bank account thing.

614
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:51,869
Rym: Because we can assume the majority of people who are productive and in the economy have bank accounts or credit cards, things like that.

615
00:25:52,771 --> 00:25:57,730
Rym: Every business can just make these assumptions and we can have this higher level of business, this higher level of economic discourse.

616
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:03,130
Rym: But with technology, you can't assume that any given person has an email address yet.

617
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:04,749
Rym: Sad but true, you just can't.

618
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:09,530
Rym: Businesses, if they need an email address, they're going to run into a lot of people who just don't have one.

619
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:13,950
Scott: Well, people also, the email addresses change frequently and they're unreliable and people don't check them.

620
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:16,510
Rym: Exactly, but technological people don't have these problems.

621
00:26:17,252 --> 00:26:20,970
Rym: Or with cell phones, I mean, you can't assume that everyone has a cell phone.

622
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:27,370
Rym: There are still pay phones all over the place and there are a lot of people who rely on them in the case of emergency because they just don't have cell phones.

623
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:32,230
Rym: So we can't make large civil structures reliant upon cell phones.

624
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:35,130
Rym: We still need this back port technology.

625
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,109
Rym: But in economics, we've gotten to the point to where...

626
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:37,869
Scott: I think it's easy to solve it.

627
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:39,942
Scott: We can do is we can just say, "Alright, listen up.

628
00:26:40,002 --> 00:26:40,545
Scott: This is what's going to

629
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:40,747
Scott: happen.".

630
00:26:41,691 --> 00:26:46,768
Scott: Anyone who has a plain old telephone line, anyone who doesn't have a plain old telephone line or a cell phone, neither one.

631
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:55,310
Rym: The people who don't have a cell phone, a number of some kind, landline or whatever, are in the same class of people who don't have bank accounts.

632
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:55,990
Scott: Exactly.

633
00:26:56,050 --> 00:27:04,606
Scott: So anyone who has a landline telephone will just give them a free piece of shit cell phone that doesn't do anything but make calls and be like, "Here you go.

634
00:27:04,787 --> 00:27:06,370
Scott: This comes with your local telephone

635
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:06,570
Scott: line.".

636
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:09,670
Rym: And what do you do when they never charge it because they don't know they have to?

637
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:16,970
Scott: Well, that's just tough shit, but at least when you ask them for their cell phone number on a form, they'll have something that they can type in and complete the form.

638
00:27:17,252 --> 00:27:19,269
Scott: You can make it a required field because they have one.

639
00:27:19,852 --> 00:27:21,303
Rym: It's annoying to me in general that I...

640
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:26,364
Scott: And if they don't bring it with them and then it causes them trouble because they don't have it, that's tough shit.

641
00:27:26,384 --> 00:27:27,989
Scott: because they can't say, "I didn't have

642
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:28,190
Scott: one.".

643
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:29,582
Scott: You can say, "Yes, you did have one.

644
00:27:29,603 --> 00:27:30,168
Scott: You didn't bring

645
00:27:30,208 --> 00:27:30,248
Scott: it.".

646
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:36,550
Rym: There are a lot of things I could be doing that would make my life a lot better like at RIT when I could order all my pizza online just like that.

647
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:38,055
Scott: I could order Chipotle online.

648
00:27:38,095 --> 00:27:40,724
Scott: It's in the same block as my office.

649
00:27:40,745 --> 00:27:42,310
Scott: I don't have to cross any streets to get to it.

650
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:43,718
Rym: But at RIT, it was all integrated.

651
00:27:43,739 --> 00:27:45,610
Rym: You could go to the same site to order them all those places.

652
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:46,617
Scott: Like at 2 a.m.

653
00:27:46,657 --> 00:27:48,570
Scott: when the pita pit would just walk up to the door.

654
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:49,115
Scott: Oh my God.

655
00:27:50,003 --> 00:27:50,850
Rym: I miss that so much.

656
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:56,590
Scott: Imagine if we could punch some numbers while we're doing the show and pita pit shows up at the door when the show is done.

657
00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:00,563
Scott: That is like... Who needs a mansion or a Ferrari?

658
00:28:00,623 --> 00:28:02,430
Scott: I want pita pit online delivery.

659
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:08,186
Rym: But no, instead, if I want to order pizza, I got to call the guy on the phone and the pizza places around here suck.

660
00:28:08,226 --> 00:28:09,530
Rym: Some of them just don't even answer.

661
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:11,783
Rym: The last time I called the guy, I didn't have the menu.

662
00:28:11,843 --> 00:28:15,316
Rym: As for Hawaiian pizza... He didn't know what Hawaiian pizza was.

663
00:28:15,336 --> 00:28:18,847
Rym: So I was like, fine, how about a margarita pizza?

664
00:28:18,867 --> 00:28:19,670
Rym: He didn't know what that was.

665
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:22,059
Rym: So I told him what it was and then he made it.

666
00:28:22,541 --> 00:28:24,690
Rym: He was like, so what, you want pepperoni?

667
00:28:26,091 --> 00:28:27,567
Scott: You should have just said yes, pepperoni.

668
00:28:27,588 --> 00:28:27,810
Scott: Fine.

669
00:28:36,311 --> 00:28:38,235
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

670
00:28:38,596 --> 00:28:44,190
Rym: So I'm sure many of you already read XKCD, but just in case, it's just too relevant.

671
00:28:44,331 --> 00:28:45,394
Rym: It's not even a joke.

672
00:28:45,836 --> 00:28:48,867
Rym: This isn't actually funny because it is 100 percent true.

673
00:28:50,151 --> 00:28:55,310
Rym: It's kind of like when I read some Dilberts from back in the day and I look at my job at IBM and all I can think is, you know what?

674
00:28:56,091 --> 00:28:57,679
Rym: That is in no way an exaggeration.

675
00:28:58,142 --> 00:28:59,570
Rym: That's exactly what my job is like.

676
00:29:00,091 --> 00:29:09,590
Scott: There is one thing that was recently modified on this chart, though, is you got to add... In addition to the Google aspect of the flow chart, you need to add the Stack Overflow trilogy is right past the Google part.

677
00:29:09,931 --> 00:29:10,956
Scott: It's like Google doesn't work.

678
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:12,423
Scott: Stack Overflow trilogy.

679
00:29:12,483 --> 00:29:13,146
Scott: That doesn't work.

680
00:29:13,267 --> 00:29:13,910
Scott: Then go back.

681
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:14,633
Rym: Well, here's the thing.

682
00:29:15,035 --> 00:29:17,910
Rym: Stack Overflow is when you're looking for an answer and you're going to ask it.

683
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:20,389
Rym: I wouldn't ask it in this situation because I wouldn't care.

684
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:22,043
Scott: I guess.

685
00:29:22,104 --> 00:29:22,470
Scott: But yeah.

686
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:26,310
Rym: And also Google, if the answer was already on Stack Overflow, it would find it.

687
00:29:26,494 --> 00:29:26,808
Rym: That's true.

688
00:29:27,931 --> 00:29:34,070
Rym: But it is the flow chart of literally how to be the local computer expert pretty much anywhere in the world.

689
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:35,882
Rym: And I am so...

690
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:38,570
Scott: It's how to be the anything expert.

691
00:29:39,033 --> 00:29:41,007
Rym: I am so dead serious when I say...

692
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:42,130
Scott: Almost anything expert.

693
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:48,470
Rym: When I say that this is all that... This is literally all that I do when anyone asks me a computer question.

694
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:48,990
Scott: Yeah.

695
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:50,756
Rym: There is no other thing I do.

696
00:29:50,776 --> 00:29:51,940
Rym: I have no special knowledge.

697
00:29:52,001 --> 00:29:54,530
Rym: I don't know... I don't even know a lot about consumer computers anymore.

698
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:55,996
Rym: This is how we learn the computer.

699
00:29:56,016 --> 00:29:59,530
Scott: shit is we just did this so many times that eventually we remember some of them.

700
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:08,670
Rym: But even then, like my work is so divorced from normal computers that if someone asks me like an Outlook question or like a Microsoft Word question or even a Windows question.

701
00:30:08,832 --> 00:30:09,189
Scott: You have no idea.

702
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:09,989
Rym: I don't know.

703
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:10,596
Scott: I don't know.

704
00:30:10,698 --> 00:30:11,389
Scott: I don't even know what to do.

705
00:30:11,731 --> 00:30:15,910
Scott: I don't know how to use Outlook or telephones, but I know how to like make websites.

706
00:30:16,412 --> 00:30:16,594
Scott: Yeah.

707
00:30:16,816 --> 00:30:17,848
Rym: I learned how to use some stupid...

708
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:24,610
Scott: I know how to do like some crazy embedded Linux shit, but I don't know anything about fucking, you know, like Microsoft PowerPoint.

709
00:30:25,351 --> 00:30:28,430
Scott: How to get a video to actually fucking work if it's possible.

710
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:35,550
Rym: But this is 100% straight up absolutely literally exactly what computer people do when you ask them a stupid question.

711
00:30:36,332 --> 00:30:38,750
Rym: So you could use this flowchart and do it yourself.

712
00:30:38,892 --> 00:30:39,490
Rym: And I'm not kidding.

713
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:40,746
Rym: It'll work every time.

714
00:30:41,253 --> 00:30:41,925
Scott: Unless you're moron.

715
00:30:43,671 --> 00:30:45,829
Scott: OK, so this is actually pretty cool.

716
00:30:46,691 --> 00:30:51,790
Scott: You know, when people are programming things right there, often the hacky last minute solutions, right?

717
00:30:52,431 --> 00:30:57,670
Scott: So, you know, often, you know, the hacky last minute solution is something that the programmer dreads.

718
00:30:57,891 --> 00:30:59,890
Scott: It's like, do I really want to do this?

719
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:01,047
Scott: It's sort of painful to do it.

720
00:31:01,491 --> 00:31:06,190
Scott: But often it is humorous, especially when it is related to video games.

721
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:13,610
Scott: So there here are 10 actual real world examples of hacky bullshit that was put into video games.

722
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:14,449
Scott: Right.

723
00:31:14,811 --> 00:31:18,710
Scott: So my favorite example is one where basically they were playing.

724
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:19,890
Scott: They're making this game right.

725
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:25,070
Scott: And in like level 10, like one of the objects needed to be invisible, but they couldn't make it.

726
00:31:25,351 --> 00:31:28,870
Scott: They wanted it to be hidden, but it just wouldn't work like in the map editor.

727
00:31:29,352 --> 00:31:37,283
Scott: So rather than redo the whole map, they went into the game engine and they basically put in like, if level equals 10 and object ID equals 58, object ID 58 is hidden.

728
00:31:39,551 --> 00:31:39,677
Rym: Wow.

729
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:45,050
Scott: And what happened was is they, you know, they later had other people using the game engine to make other games.

730
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:46,390
Scott: You know, they sold it out like unreal.

731
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:47,969
Rym: No one can figure out how to make something hidden.

732
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:49,008
Scott: No, no, no, no, no.

733
00:31:49,270 --> 00:32:02,950
Scott: It's somebody was making a game and they're like, they made in level 10, the 58th object they made, and they called them up with like, you know, cause with this for the support and they're like, Hey, I'll come to this object keeps disappearing.

734
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:03,443
Scott: What do we do?

735
00:32:04,754 --> 00:32:05,484
Scott: Uh, just make a 59th object.

736
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:14,090
Scott: You know, but yeah, that was a, you know, that's just one of the examples in this funny, funny, uh, website.

737
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:18,150
Rym: That is very close to why I enjoy negative worlds and things so much in video games.

738
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:25,310
Scott: So you should, you should read this for more similar humorous anecdotes and that particular humorous anecdote as well.

739
00:32:25,731 --> 00:32:31,270
Rym: So we were debating some sort of what if show tonight, we won't go super long on this, but I think it's a good concept.

740
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:35,550
Rym: We could explore in much more detail, but we were thinking about what if something crazy happened?

741
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:38,670
Rym: Like what if windows went open source?

742
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:44,190
Scott: Well, I mean, it's, I started thinking of like, you know, the, the question of like, what would you do if you were in charge of Apple?

743
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:47,149
Scott: Well, the answer is always I'd open source everything and be the good guy.

744
00:32:47,651 --> 00:32:51,790
Scott: I don't, you know, and I'd live a life of luxury with all the monies, you know, and it's the same situations.

745
00:32:51,871 --> 00:32:53,370
Scott: Like what if you were in charge of the phone companies?

746
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:54,710
Scott: I'd stop being a Dick.

747
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:58,390
Scott: I'd give everyone unlimited everything for a low, low price and I'd make the network not suck.

748
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:05,190
Scott: And I'd let you use any phone with any app and you know, and it's like, okay, there's nothing really exciting to talk about in that question.

749
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:12,529
Scott: So I was like, the more interesting question is like, if the shit was open source, what awesome thing would you do?

750
00:33:13,452 --> 00:33:16,449
Scott: You know, it's, it's like, you know, cause what would you do?

751
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:18,990
Scott: You know, like if the iPhone, it's like, okay, sure.

752
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,429
Scott: The iPhone's open source now.

753
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,570
Scott: What are you going to do?

754
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:22,390
Scott: That's so awesome.

755
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:26,470
Scott: Now, uh, podcasts sinking over the airwaves.

756
00:33:26,994 --> 00:33:27,690
Rym: That's a good one.

757
00:33:27,912 --> 00:33:28,507
Rym: And Google voice.

758
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:30,849
Scott: That's a good one too.

759
00:33:31,133 --> 00:33:31,328
Rym: That's it.

760
00:33:31,532 --> 00:33:32,230
Rym: That and multitasking.

761
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:42,510
Scott: Yeah, no, I would do, um, wifi, Bluetooth, uh, uh, exchanging of, of, uh, music and video that was completely uninhibited in any way whatsoever.

762
00:33:43,051 --> 00:33:46,570
Scott: So like you could just go to your, you know, connect from your iPhone to your friend's iPhone.

763
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:47,424
Scott: You're just like, here's my MP3.

764
00:33:47,812 --> 00:33:48,509
Scott: Just sends it to him.

765
00:33:48,753 --> 00:33:49,670
Scott: And now it's on his iPod.

766
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:50,269
Scott: No problem.

767
00:33:51,453 --> 00:33:53,149
Scott: Why doesn't the zoom fricking do this?

768
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:54,810
Scott: Why doesn't anyone do this?

769
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:57,809
Scott: It's no, there's no technological problem preventing this.

770
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:59,410
Rym: Well, the media companies might sue them.

771
00:33:59,594 --> 00:34:00,129
Scott: It's tough shit.

772
00:34:00,212 --> 00:34:00,670
Scott: We didn't do it.

773
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:01,668
Scott: It's not illegal to do that.

774
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:06,730
Scott: People are exchanging their files that they, that they, you know, they have legitimately.

775
00:34:07,116 --> 00:34:07,266
Scott: Yeah.

776
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:15,730
Rym: So the thing is all the companies who are in a position to do it are too enmeshed in the media companies and all the stuff to do it.

777
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:17,350
Scott: I would totally do that so quickly.

778
00:34:17,751 --> 00:34:24,070
Rym: Um, so Scott, the question on the show that is, what would you do if Linux were open source?

779
00:34:24,672 --> 00:34:26,469
Scott: Ah, everything I'm already notice.

780
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:27,630
Scott: Isn't it so weird, right?

781
00:34:27,911 --> 00:34:30,630
Scott: It's like if Linux are open source, which it is, what would you do?

782
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:39,650
Scott: And it's like, well, I don't really do anything because you know, part of it is because a Linux is an operating system kernel and I'm not really a kernel kind of programming guys.

783
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:45,610
Scott: There's not much I can do in that area without lots of work, but it's also be sort of because it's been done.

784
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,889
Scott: It's like everyone's fucking doing it.

785
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:48,357
Scott: They jump on it before you can even get.

786
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:50,850
Rym: well, except for media support and sound.

787
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:51,788
Scott: People are working on it.

788
00:34:51,949 --> 00:34:53,029
Scott: There's actually some big head.

789
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:53,829
Scott: Did you see?

790
00:34:54,011 --> 00:34:55,069
Scott: Oh my God, there's a thing.

791
00:34:55,391 --> 00:34:56,368
Scott: Uh, you're going to love this.

792
00:34:57,013 --> 00:34:58,930
Scott: Uh, Ubuntu is coming out with this thing called quickly.

793
00:34:59,798 --> 00:35:00,430
Rym: I was looking at that.

794
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:01,127
Scott: Did you see that?

795
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:02,008
Scott: I sent you the link.

796
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:03,610
Rym: My coworker was looking at it actually.

797
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:04,768
Rym: He's more developer than I am.

798
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:05,119
Scott: Yeah.

799
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:06,632
Scott: It's basically what they did.

800
00:35:06,673 --> 00:35:14,990
Scott: is we come up with all these web frameworks to help you like rails and Django that, you know, to make web pages, you know, with a nice, you know, model and everything, right?

801
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:19,050
Scott: Jenga Ubuntu just basically came out with the same thing for desktop apps.

802
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:20,790
Scott: So it's like, yeah, just use this.

803
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:23,190
Scott: And it's real easy to make Ubuntu desktop applications.

804
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:24,430
Scott: I'm like, holy shit.

805
00:35:24,711 --> 00:35:26,830
Scott: That's like way ahead of Microsoft right there.

806
00:35:27,273 --> 00:35:27,768
Scott: Way ahead.

807
00:35:28,211 --> 00:35:31,110
Scott: It's like, it's like XNA for like desktop applications.

808
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:32,168
Scott: That's like, that's a big deal.

809
00:35:32,731 --> 00:35:35,570
Scott: And I think it's gonna, I think I might actually, I might learn it and make something.

810
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:36,769
Scott: I mean, who knows?

811
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:39,669
Rym: Make me a, uh, a resound that doesn't crash.

812
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:42,990
Scott: Well, the joke kosher was sorta gonna be that.

813
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:44,379
Rym: Do anything and audacity.

814
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:46,850
Rym: They keep talking.

815
00:35:47,111 --> 00:35:49,510
Rym: The thing is he's going to go somewhere, but it's not.

816
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:55,810
Scott: If you get me, I need to get like a book of like audio algorithms and then I need to get a book about like wave files.

817
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:55,958
Scott: Right.

818
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:59,410
Scott: And then I can just get all the open source decoders and encoders.

819
00:35:59,679 --> 00:35:59,890
Scott: Right.

820
00:36:00,292 --> 00:36:02,365
Scott: And I can convert everything to wave format.

821
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:03,070
Rym: thing is lads.

822
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:05,830
Scott: And then I can get an open source fast for your transform.

823
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:12,730
Scott: And then once I have all those pieces that I don't have to reinvent those wheels, I just have to implement the algorithms as they are in the.

824
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:15,750
Rym: The thing is with lads, but there are a lot of plugins that do all those things.

825
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:17,209
Rym: All I really need is the good interface.

826
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:18,610
Scott: Oh, you just need the interface.

827
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:20,054
Rym: The interface is all you can do.

828
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:25,470
Scott: the interface because it uses Glade, which basically is just a drag and drop, draw your interface.

829
00:36:25,611 --> 00:36:28,070
Scott: And then it makes an XML file that defines the interface.

830
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:29,108
Scott: You can do all that.

831
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:32,589
Scott: Then you just bind the interface to the methods in the, in the thing.

832
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:35,570
Rym: The thing is what I need is all the rest of the code under the interface.

833
00:36:35,951 --> 00:36:40,770
Scott: It comes with, you can just steal it from, you know, reusable libraries and such like and such and such.

834
00:36:40,912 --> 00:36:41,909
Rym: It's already too much work.

835
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:42,488
Rym: I don't have time.

836
00:36:42,991 --> 00:36:43,141
Scott: Yeah.

837
00:36:43,391 --> 00:36:45,490
Scott: Well, you know, it would take you longer than it would take me.

838
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:47,150
Rym: What would I do if anything was open source?

839
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:48,790
Rym: The answer is nothing because I'm too busy.

840
00:36:49,171 --> 00:36:49,385
Scott: Yeah.

841
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:49,907
Scott: Yeah.

842
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:58,930
Scott: But I guess it's more about, I mean, like I would do all that kind of shit for the iPhone if I didn't have to do it in like Objective C with, and they didn't, you know, there's no app approval process crap.

843
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:09,430
Scott: You know, I do the same shit for like, you know, any portable device, you know, just freely transfer files between the devices, you know, run any app, you know, do all that stuff.

844
00:37:09,612 --> 00:37:10,650
Scott: Maybe it had like a video edit.

845
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:12,289
Scott: They need some video editing on there.

846
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:13,037
Scott: There's just, there's.

847
00:37:13,057 --> 00:37:13,970
Scott: no, you know, it's like nothing.

848
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:17,550
Scott: A lot of them let you take videos, but they don't let you edit the videos.

849
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:26,570
Scott: It's like, you know, even like, like the iPhone, actually, I took some pictures with the iPhone like yesterday, but again, and when I pushed the picture button, it looked fine.

850
00:37:27,112 --> 00:37:29,410
Scott: And then later when I uploaded to Flickr, they're blurry.

851
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:30,370
Scott: I was like, what the hell?

852
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:35,310
Scott: It didn't give me like this usable picture preview and get like lied to me.

853
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:36,489
Scott: It told me the picture was fine.

854
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,190
Rym: The pre is like perfect.

855
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:39,830
Scott: The pre is a lot better with the pictures.

856
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:40,928
Scott: There's no doubt about that.

857
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:43,590
Scott: What would you do if like the windows were open source?

858
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:44,869
Scott: That's like the notorious one.

859
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:46,416
Rym: The thing is, I think there's the, you know, like.

860
00:37:46,436 --> 00:37:50,330
Rym: what would I do personally if I were, if I had the time to code and everything?

861
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:53,030
Scott: Yeah, we're assuming that you can do it and you have time to do it.

862
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:54,670
Rym: Because I would look more at Apple.

863
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:56,410
Rym: Apple is what I really want to be open source.

864
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:57,270
Scott: Yeah, it's mad close.

865
00:37:57,490 --> 00:38:04,050
Rym: Because what I would do is I would add goddamn refresh buttons to every single window and dialogue and all of fucking OS X.

866
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:04,788
Scott: All the finder.

867
00:38:04,932 --> 00:38:05,670
Rym: Oh my God.

868
00:38:05,872 --> 00:38:06,769
Rym: Everything would refresh.

869
00:38:07,356 --> 00:38:08,750
Rym: I could refresh it manually.

870
00:38:09,232 --> 00:38:10,950
Scott: I'd fix all the stupid keyboard shortcuts.

871
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:11,728
Scott: That's what I would do.

872
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:15,189
Rym: I would remove the Apple key entirely and use the windows key.

873
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:19,570
Scott: Yeah, well, the command key is the windows key, right?

874
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,950
Scott: That's the secret that people don't realize.

875
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:22,649
Rym: But I would make it act like the windows key.

876
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,029
Rym: There'd be no like Apple key.

877
00:38:24,751 --> 00:38:27,870
Scott: Everything would be control and all and not, you know, command.

878
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:32,870
Scott: Command would not be used for keyboard shortcuts unless the windows key were also used for those keys.

879
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:42,329
Rym: I would also figure out all the contexts of all the different things in OS X. And I would then make a banner added to the bottom of every window and every program telling you what context you were in.

880
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:42,781
Scott: Yep.

881
00:38:43,536 --> 00:38:43,989
Scott: That's it.

882
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:44,525
Scott: That's good.

883
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:45,461
Scott: Yeah.

884
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:50,890
Scott: I would also make it so that you could like, you know, maximize a window and it would actually perfectly and nicely maximize.

885
00:38:51,672 --> 00:38:54,510
Scott: It wouldn't be like, yeah, we'll sort of stretch out a bit here.

886
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:55,948
Scott: We won't really, you know.

887
00:38:56,635 --> 00:38:57,430
Rym: It always bothers me.

888
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:59,710
Rym: I hit maximize the window that gets like 10 pixels bigger.

889
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:00,649
Rym: I'm like, what the fuck?

890
00:39:00,911 --> 00:39:04,970
Scott: It's like I want to actually, you know, let me lay out these windows in a nice grid.

891
00:39:05,351 --> 00:39:11,050
Scott: You know, why are you making me sort of, you know, waste all this desktop space just so I can, you know, force me to be fast and loose.

892
00:39:11,733 --> 00:39:12,348
Scott: Screw that shit.

893
00:39:14,322 --> 00:39:14,490
Rym: Yeah.

894
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:15,063
Rym: Yeah.

895
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:17,030
Rym: With windows is tough because there's not a lot.

896
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:23,130
Scott: Because I think the problem with windows is that, you know, even though it's closed source, everything already exists for windows.

897
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:29,510
Scott: You know, it's like maybe what I would do for windows, right, is I would sort of rewrite like, you know, the front ends of it.

898
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:33,370
Scott: Like I would take the windows kernel and so that it could run any windows application.

899
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:35,670
Scott: You know, I'd get all the libraries and all that stuff.

900
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:35,850
Scott: Right.

901
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:36,969
Scott: All the under the hood parts.

902
00:39:37,481 --> 00:39:37,670
Scott: Maybe.

903
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:40,050
Scott: Well, I guess, you know, you could do if windows is open source.

904
00:39:40,479 --> 00:39:40,690
Scott: Right.

905
00:39:41,071 --> 00:39:44,130
Scott: It would be really like wine would basically be gangbusters.

906
00:39:44,378 --> 00:39:44,569
Scott: Right.

907
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:56,410
Scott: So what you could do is you could basically take it and fork it and make a perfect implementation of the windows API such that you could run any windows application on a machine that's not running windows.

908
00:39:57,114 --> 00:39:59,530
Scott: And it would work perfectly, you know, as if it was windows.

909
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:01,067
Scott: And I guess you could do the same thing with Mac.

910
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:07,530
Scott: Like if OS X was completely open source, every part of it, then you could just re implement the entire API.

911
00:40:08,232 --> 00:40:11,770
Scott: You know, you could just take the code and, you know, just use it, reuse it.

912
00:40:12,091 --> 00:40:21,610
Scott: And you can make like this wicked crazy fast, you know, machine that could run any Linux, windows or Mac application just natively with no virtual machines whatsoever.

913
00:40:21,811 --> 00:40:25,650
Rym: Well, if I'm going wish list wise, I would just make the windows kernel para virtualized.

914
00:40:26,833 --> 00:40:28,770
Rym: Well, isn't it able to be virtualized?

915
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:31,390
Scott: You can use Microsoft's virtually that they bought.

916
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:32,049
Scott: What's it called?

917
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:34,710
Rym: But you can't use it just like straight up with VMware or Zen yet.

918
00:40:35,074 --> 00:40:35,650
Scott: Yeah, it's true.

919
00:40:35,791 --> 00:40:36,106
Scott: It's true.

920
00:40:36,655 --> 00:40:37,128
Scott: Yeah, that is.

921
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:38,024
Scott: Yeah, you can't.

922
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:38,464
Scott: Yes.

923
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:39,609
Scott: And it only works with mixes.

924
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,489
Scott: It doesn't work with OS X or.

925
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:42,243
Scott: Yeah.

926
00:40:43,211 --> 00:40:44,290
Scott: Yeah, that's something else, right?

927
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:52,550
Scott: Is like if you're on a Mac and you use a virtual machine thing like virtual box or parallels, you can run Linux's, of course, in any virtual environment.

928
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:55,510
Scott: But you can also run Windows's on Windows.

929
00:40:56,591 --> 00:41:02,030
Scott: You can run Windows's and Linux's in your VMware, but you can't run OS X in your VMware on Windows.

930
00:41:02,412 --> 00:41:04,329
Scott: You can't run OS X on anything but a Mac.

931
00:41:04,715 --> 00:41:05,589
Scott: But it was open source.

932
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:09,669
Scott: You could run your OS X, you know, on your PC that you bought built from Newegg.

933
00:41:10,072 --> 00:41:12,310
Scott: You could run it in your virtual machine on your Linux box.

934
00:41:12,674 --> 00:41:13,949
Scott: You could run it just freaking anywhere.

935
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:19,290
Scott: So I think I really think if OS X is open source, there would be a lot less Mac purchasing.

936
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:23,430
Scott: I think there'll be a lot of people running OS X and all sorts of other devices.

937
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:30,870
Rym: But at the same time, I feel like Apple could still make money in that world in the long run with with their good industrial design.

938
00:41:31,413 --> 00:41:33,010
Rym: They'd have to cut their profit margins.

939
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:41,350
Rym: But if they just made different styles of embedded or small purpose specific, like, you know, think about the wonderful industrial design of the Mac Mini right now.

940
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:42,549
Rym: That thing is a beauty to behold.

941
00:41:42,671 --> 00:41:43,208
Scott: Well, the thing.

942
00:41:43,531 --> 00:41:49,450
Rym: What if they made like 10 different computers that were like that for different purposes, like the car computer and the house computer?

943
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:51,009
Scott: Yeah, well, the car computer you don't see.

944
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:56,370
Scott: But I think Apple's big thing is that their business model is cell hardware and everything else.

945
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:59,690
Scott: iTunes, you know, OS X, whatever.

946
00:42:00,332 --> 00:42:03,090
Scott: All those things are just there because they sell hardware.

947
00:42:03,171 --> 00:42:04,910
Scott: That's why the Snow Leopard is only thirty dollars.

948
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:09,650
Scott: It's coming out Friday, by the way, is because they're not trying to sell you Snow Leopard.

949
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:14,590
Scott: Snow Leopard only exists because it's so awesome and it only runs on the Mac hardware.

950
00:42:14,711 --> 00:42:18,050
Scott: So it makes you buy the Mac hardware, which they overcharge you for.

951
00:42:18,232 --> 00:42:18,435
Scott: Right.

952
00:42:18,476 --> 00:42:19,330
Scott: And they make all their money.

953
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:38,110
Scott: If you could get all the Apple shinies on other platforms besides Apple hardware, they would actually have to make their money on non hardware or they'd have to make their or they would basically lose all their profit margin because their hardware would not have to compete with the other hardware on a level playing field.

954
00:42:38,733 --> 00:42:41,490
Scott: And Apple would basically just go, well, they have no business.

955
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:42,073
Scott: They'd have to.

956
00:42:42,194 --> 00:42:42,739
Scott: What would they do?

957
00:42:42,759 --> 00:42:43,969
Scott: What would their business model be?

958
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:48,910
Rym: The thing is, right now, for certain kinds of industrial design, no one even comes close to Apple.

959
00:42:49,391 --> 00:42:56,290
Scott: Some have this better industrial design, but they can only charge so much more for it if OS X runs on other devices.

960
00:42:56,550 --> 00:43:02,530
Rym: But if they dropped all of their development teams, except for the iPhone stuff, they'd probably be fine.

961
00:43:03,172 --> 00:43:08,690
Scott: No, because then no one would because then the no one would use the OS X, everyone use Windows, and then no one would use a Mac.

962
00:43:08,931 --> 00:43:11,069
Scott: Now, because they'd have to start selling Macs with Windows on.

963
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:19,950
Scott: They'd probably just let the open source community make OS OS, whatever, because if they don't control the whole experience, the whole thing falls apart because Apple.

964
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:25,970
Scott: The reason that Apple stuff get gives you the experience it does is because they unify the hardware in the.

965
00:43:26,231 --> 00:43:27,570
Scott: You know, it's like look at Android.

966
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,630
Scott: Android is designed for any sort of phone.

967
00:43:29,753 --> 00:43:29,938
Scott: Right.

968
00:43:29,979 --> 00:43:30,370
Scott: So what do you get?

969
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:34,210
Scott: You get these funky ass devices that don't have like a headphone hole and shit like that.

970
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:34,491
Scott: Right.

971
00:43:34,812 --> 00:43:39,870
Scott: But the iPhone software is built assuming you have an iPhone with this one button.

972
00:43:40,211 --> 00:43:40,713
Scott: And right.

973
00:43:40,974 --> 00:43:44,470
Scott: It's the hardware software unity that makes the stuff work that way.

974
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:50,810
Scott: And if the saw if the OS X is done in an open source way just to make it as good as possible, it would be awesome.

975
00:43:51,271 --> 00:43:51,551
Scott: Right.

976
00:43:51,872 --> 00:43:58,230
Scott: But you wouldn't have that crate that, you know, Apple unified experience where the hardware and the software go together.

977
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:03,450
Scott: Like you have that eject button in the top right of the keyboard and the OS, you know, ejects when you hold it down.

978
00:44:03,771 --> 00:44:09,550
Rym: But at the same time, there would probably be among all the forks of OS X and OS 11.

979
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:12,750
Scott: You wouldn't have like the multi finger gestures and the giant touch pad.

980
00:44:13,071 --> 00:44:16,570
Rym: But it's got all the different force and things that the craziness that would happen.

981
00:44:17,231 --> 00:44:24,130
Rym: I am sure I expect that there would be one fork that was predominantly controlled by Apple fanboys.

982
00:44:24,991 --> 00:44:25,292
Scott: Yeah.

983
00:44:25,352 --> 00:44:29,226
Scott: But Apple fanboys are much, you know, the problem with that right is.

984
00:44:29,266 --> 00:44:30,230
Scott: I know that sounds good.

985
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:31,736
Rym: I'm not saying it sounds good.

986
00:44:31,776 --> 00:44:34,170
Rym: I'm saying that they might keep the spirit alive.

987
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:34,631
Scott: No.

988
00:44:35,575 --> 00:44:38,790
Scott: Something I've learned is that fanboys ruin the spirit.

989
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:39,974
Scott: I mean, think about this.

990
00:44:40,015 --> 00:44:42,970
Scott: That's like letting people in the tribes forums write tribes.

991
00:44:43,891 --> 00:44:44,594
Scott: It's not going to work.

992
00:44:45,197 --> 00:44:45,638
Scott: Not at all.

993
00:44:45,819 --> 00:44:48,510
Scott: It's you can't let the people who play the game write the game.

994
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:49,494
Scott: It's just a mess.

995
00:44:49,655 --> 00:44:52,930
Scott: Or Scott letting Magic the Gathering players write Magic the Gathering cards.

996
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:54,333
Rym: I guess let me put it in this perspective.

997
00:44:54,373 --> 00:45:02,890
Rym: What if it was open source and Steve Jobs and over the Steve Jobs fork, just like there's the whoever he delegated.

998
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:08,684
Rym: You know, he would bless one fork and he would like approve different releases of that fork.

999
00:45:08,864 --> 00:45:11,150
Rym: as you know, you can use whatever one you want.

1000
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:12,174
Rym: It's all open source.

1001
00:45:12,556 --> 00:45:15,529
Rym: But this is the one that Apple says is the good one.

1002
00:45:16,952 --> 00:45:20,170
Scott: Somehow, I don't think he would like any of them as soon as he got open source.

1003
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:22,237
Scott: And he'd like start saying, do this, do that.

1004
00:45:22,278 --> 00:45:25,650
Scott: And people who said is, you know, he'd have to start dealing with this kind of shit.

1005
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:28,390
Scott: Linus Torvalds deals with where people actually tell him he's wrong.

1006
00:45:29,053 --> 00:45:32,370
Rym: But the thing is, I love the man, but he's an asshole.

1007
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:33,572
Scott: I didn't say he wasn't an asshole.

1008
00:45:33,592 --> 00:45:35,055
Scott: I'm saying, you know, people can't.

1009
00:45:35,276 --> 00:45:41,330
Scott: people in the open source world have to deal with, you know, people arguing with them and telling them they're wrong and actually having debates over decisions.

1010
00:45:42,171 --> 00:45:47,470
Scott: Steve Jobs just says it's my way or the highway, and I don't think he could deal with someone telling him no.

1011
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:53,610
Scott: And if it's open source, even if there's the Steve Jobs blessed version and maybe he has some fanboys who do his bidding.

1012
00:45:54,111 --> 00:45:55,570
Rym: Enough people would do his bidding, sadly.

1013
00:45:55,910 --> 00:46:01,810
Scott: The thing is someone would eventually come and be like, Steve Jobs, this is a bad, dumb ass idea.

1014
00:46:01,931 --> 00:46:03,158
Scott: You should do it this way instead.

1015
00:46:03,178 --> 00:46:05,070
Scott: And he'd be like, no, no, no, no, no.

1016
00:46:05,191 --> 00:46:06,569
Scott: It's like, you know, you get forks.

1017
00:46:07,051 --> 00:46:09,689
Rym: But Scott, that wouldn't be any different than it is now.

1018
00:46:10,332 --> 00:46:13,306
Scott: Steve Jobs would basically have a heart attack to go with his liver action.

1019
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:16,890
Rym: The thing is, none of that's going to happen.

1020
00:46:17,571 --> 00:46:24,930
Rym: And the more interesting question is what would like, what would be the actual ramifications of if like Microsoft, just like Bill Gates, like, you know what?

1021
00:46:25,312 --> 00:46:25,735
Rym: It's over.

1022
00:46:25,795 --> 00:46:27,850
Rym: And everything was just like Windows is open source.

1023
00:46:28,014 --> 00:46:28,446
Rym: And that was it.

1024
00:46:28,711 --> 00:46:30,068
Scott: Well, Microsoft make a lot less money.

1025
00:46:30,851 --> 00:46:33,110
Scott: I mean, Microsoft really doesn't have a way to make money.

1026
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:34,723
Scott: They're not like Apple selling hardware.

1027
00:46:34,763 --> 00:46:35,530
Scott: They sell Windows.

1028
00:46:36,073 --> 00:46:37,339
Scott: Windows is open source, right?

1029
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:38,103
Scott: Because think about this.

1030
00:46:38,284 --> 00:46:39,510
Scott: This has been a hot topic lately.

1031
00:46:40,133 --> 00:46:41,329
Scott: When you're a Linux guy, right?

1032
00:46:42,712 --> 00:46:43,376
Scott: Linux is free.

1033
00:46:43,417 --> 00:46:44,705
Scott: You can install it a billion times.

1034
00:46:44,745 --> 00:46:45,269
Scott: No problem.

1035
00:46:45,329 --> 00:46:45,490
Scott: Right.

1036
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:48,650
Scott: So when you say you want to set up like a cluster, it's no big deal.

1037
00:46:48,731 --> 00:46:51,070
Scott: It's like, oh, we'll get a bunch of hardware, a bunch of machines.

1038
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,466
Scott: It was all Linux on all of them.

1039
00:46:52,527 --> 00:46:52,709
Scott: Right.

1040
00:46:53,230 --> 00:47:00,730
Scott: When you're a Windows guy, setting up one gigantic, crazy, powerful computer instead of a cluster is a good idea.

1041
00:47:00,931 --> 00:47:02,318
Scott: And it's like, what are you crazy?

1042
00:47:02,379 --> 00:47:04,309
Scott: No one does the one giant machine anymore.

1043
00:47:04,892 --> 00:47:06,743
Scott: Everyone does the bunch of cheap machines.

1044
00:47:06,783 --> 00:47:07,649
Scott: That's the way to do it.

1045
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:13,590
Scott: But with Windows, a bunch of cheap machines, you have to buy a copy of Windows for each machine.

1046
00:47:13,851 --> 00:47:18,030
Scott: Now, the machines aren't cheap anymore because you're buying a two hundred dollar copy of Windows for all the machines.

1047
00:47:18,272 --> 00:47:19,279
Scott: You got five machines.

1048
00:47:19,299 --> 00:47:20,730
Scott: That's an extra thousand dollars.

1049
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:23,190
Scott: You're paying six machines worth of money for five machines.

1050
00:47:23,652 --> 00:47:26,627
Scott: If you need 10 machines, it's a two thousand dollars.

1051
00:47:26,687 --> 00:47:27,170
Scott: It's crazy.

1052
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:34,210
Scott: So Windows people, it's actually sort of good idea to get the one big machine and install Windows on it once.

1053
00:47:34,291 --> 00:47:35,262
Scott: You know, and think about it.

1054
00:47:35,282 --> 00:47:36,010
Scott: That's only Windows.

1055
00:47:36,331 --> 00:47:39,845
Scott: If you're doing a Microsoft platform, you've got to buy SQL Server.

1056
00:47:40,046 --> 00:47:41,150
Scott: You've got to buy maybe Office.

1057
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:42,500
Scott: You've got to buy Exchange Server.

1058
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:43,890
Scott: Who knows what you're putting on there.

1059
00:47:44,251 --> 00:47:48,130
Scott: All the Microsoft server stuff costs money, lots of money, tons of money, you know.

1060
00:47:48,531 --> 00:47:51,110
Scott: So one big machine is a good idea with Microsoft.

1061
00:47:51,411 --> 00:47:57,910
Scott: If it was open source and people would just get, there was no Windows licenses and no, you know, licenses for any of the Microsoft software.

1062
00:47:58,433 --> 00:48:01,570
Scott: People would start installing Windows and everything, tons, you know, machines.

1063
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:06,770
Scott: And Microsoft wouldn't get any money from that and they wouldn't get money from anything.

1064
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:08,235
Scott: And that's it.

1065
00:48:08,296 --> 00:48:10,245
Scott: They would get money for supporting like Red Hat.

1066
00:48:10,285 --> 00:48:11,210
Scott: They'd be in the poorhouse.

1067
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:16,630
Scott: Microsoft would turn from like this giant world conquering company into like a one building situation.

1068
00:48:16,751 --> 00:48:17,800
Rym: But that's pretty much expected.

1069
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:18,930
Rym: What would happen in the community?

1070
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:20,236
Rym: I mean, there would be.

1071
00:48:20,256 --> 00:48:20,719
Scott: there would be.

1072
00:48:20,759 --> 00:48:22,650
Scott: there would be crazy action with Windows.

1073
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:36,390
Rym: I think with Windows specifically, just because of the way the architecture is and the way people, it would take at least a couple of years for the community to grasp the code enough to make meaningful and safe changes to it.

1074
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:38,610
Scott: No, I don't think it would be about making safety.

1075
00:48:38,810 --> 00:48:40,001
Rym: No, I think what it would be is people would.

1076
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:40,910
Rym: what would really happen.

1077
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:51,450
Rym: People would go in and find the good, like the specific bits that they needed to know how they work, like different APIs or different functions under the covers and port them elsewhere.

1078
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:51,792
Rym: Absolutely.

1079
00:48:51,833 --> 00:48:52,659
Scott: It would be a raid.

1080
00:48:52,779 --> 00:48:54,270
Scott: It'd be like, holy shit.

1081
00:48:54,611 --> 00:48:55,317
Scott: You know, it's like.

1082
00:48:55,337 --> 00:48:56,950
Scott: what if Photoshop was open source, right?

1083
00:48:57,110 --> 00:48:58,950
Rym: Like we just get any of this on Linux like that.

1084
00:48:59,251 --> 00:49:00,400
Scott: And I think if Photoshop.

1085
00:49:00,441 --> 00:49:01,630
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty solid.

1086
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:04,229
Scott: I mean, if Photoshop was open source, people might modify it.

1087
00:49:04,530 --> 00:49:09,470
Scott: But I think mostly the GIMP would just have a field day and raid it for all the filtering algorithms and stuff.

1088
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:11,729
Scott: They'd be like, well, Photoshop plugins work in the GIMP now.

1089
00:49:12,152 --> 00:49:14,829
Scott: You know, they just be raiding it, stealing all the good out.

1090
00:49:15,031 --> 00:49:17,010
Scott: What if the Nvidia driver was open source?

1091
00:49:17,152 --> 00:49:17,374
Scott: Right.

1092
00:49:17,616 --> 00:49:18,829
Scott: They would be a raid.

1093
00:49:19,131 --> 00:49:20,950
Scott: They would take that shit and put it right in the kernel.

1094
00:49:21,071 --> 00:49:22,949
Scott: Like it would take a day, if not less.

1095
00:49:23,451 --> 00:49:26,089
Scott: You know, they just like, here's all those algorithms that we didn't know.

1096
00:49:26,471 --> 00:49:29,430
Scott: You know, here's all the secrets of how that hardware works.

1097
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:30,849
Scott: Let's steal all that shit.

1098
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:40,390
Scott: Well, it wouldn't be stealing because we open source, but you just take all the good stuff and they would use it elsewhere as opposed to fixing it in its, you know, its current place.

1099
00:49:41,371 --> 00:49:45,910
Scott: You get like, you know, the GIMP would be doing like all this stuff that Photoshop does that everyone complains about.

1100
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:53,510
Scott: You'd get like support for, you know, all those weird webcams and stuff and Linux just suddenly, you know, all that kind of stuff.

1101
00:49:54,571 --> 00:50:03,150
Scott: It wouldn't be there wouldn't be that much modifying of windows to do other things, because if you start doing that, you'd actually break more than you fixed.

1102
00:50:03,671 --> 00:50:03,912
Scott: Right.

1103
00:50:03,932 --> 00:50:07,670
Scott: Because I mean, windows, all these things are built to work on windows in a certain way.

1104
00:50:07,931 --> 00:50:09,058
Scott: You know what someone might do?

1105
00:50:09,099 --> 00:50:10,829
Scott: They might do the no registry windows fork.

1106
00:50:11,971 --> 00:50:17,310
Scott: I can see that someone make a fork of windows that doesn't have a registry that has like a couch DB instead.

1107
00:50:19,573 --> 00:50:21,089
Rym: The thing is, it would serve the same purpose.

1108
00:50:21,793 --> 00:50:23,330
Scott: No, but a couch DB would outperform.

1109
00:50:24,272 --> 00:50:26,770
Scott: Well, the real problem with the registry is a file system situation.

1110
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:33,310
Rym: The real problem with the registry is partly that windows has no real capability to refresh without rebooting.

1111
00:50:33,711 --> 00:50:37,690
Scott: Yeah, that someone making no reboot windows unless you update the windows kernel.

1112
00:50:39,331 --> 00:50:52,190
Scott: You get all sorts of stuff like that, maybe, but mostly if stuff became open source, like if apples, if OS X became open source, the next day, Linux and gnome would have like the most beautiful font rendering in the universe.

1113
00:50:52,673 --> 00:50:55,290
Scott: You know, they would just steal OS X font rendering in the drop shadows.

1114
00:50:55,690 --> 00:50:56,082
Scott: Like, thank you.

1115
00:50:56,830 --> 00:51:04,350
Rym: So the moral here is that OS 10 and Microsoft windows will never, ever, ever be open source because it would destroy both companies.

1116
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:05,233
Scott: Probably not.

1117
00:51:05,334 --> 00:51:09,730
Scott: No, I mean, it might happen if like someone with a ton of money just buys them out.

1118
00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:13,090
Scott: It might happen if say, see, it's something I don't understand, right?

1119
00:51:14,091 --> 00:51:21,030
Scott: They should, what they should do to sort of get the most because they're not, they're not maximizing their, what they're doing, right?

1120
00:51:21,570 --> 00:51:22,993
Scott: What they should do is they should follow in.

1121
00:51:23,033 --> 00:51:31,730
Scott: software model is when, like when windows seven comes out, open source XP, you don't need to open source Vista, but open source the XP, right?

1122
00:51:32,071 --> 00:51:36,164
Scott: No one's for, you know, I mean, or at least open source, like windows 2000 or NT or 3.1 is so old.

1123
00:51:38,312 --> 00:51:38,979
Scott: There's nothing.

1124
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:40,009
Scott: What is in there?

1125
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:45,890
Rym: Well, well, you need to, I mean, maybe something in there, but, but I can say there's two reasons.

1126
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:48,030
Rym: One, there's probably some code in there.

1127
00:51:48,070 --> 00:51:48,707
Rym: They don't want out.

1128
00:51:49,051 --> 00:51:52,630
Rym: They're worried that people might find exploits that made their way into more modern versions.

1129
00:51:52,811 --> 00:51:53,348
Scott: I mean, oh no.

1130
00:51:53,651 --> 00:51:56,871
Scott: I mean, the wine can already run any windows 3.1.

1131
00:51:56,871 --> 00:52:01,170
Rym: More importantly, there are probably patent and cross.

1132
00:52:01,652 --> 00:52:02,870
Scott: That's a legal situation.

1133
00:52:03,010 --> 00:52:03,828
Scott: I'm talking about business.

1134
00:52:04,271 --> 00:52:07,630
Rym: I'm ignoring the legal, the legal situation is the primary reason.

1135
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:10,549
Rym: I mean, uh, was to warp.

1136
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:12,009
Rym: We finished using it.

1137
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:12,776
Rym: We had version 4.5 at IBM.

1138
00:52:14,494 --> 00:52:15,070
Rym: We used it.

1139
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:18,170
Rym: And yet we know it'll never be open source.

1140
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:22,370
Rym: And I have, uh, uh, OS two warp for my first computer.

1141
00:52:22,590 --> 00:52:24,790
Scott: There are so many owned in my house that I was to work.

1142
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:31,650
Rym: There's so many IP owned by all these different companies and so many patents and so much stuff on the inside.

1143
00:52:31,770 --> 00:52:32,929
Rym: That'll never be open source.

1144
00:52:33,031 --> 00:52:34,129
Rym: Now it's lost to the world.

1145
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:43,349
Scott: But I mean, like why doesn't Apple open source like, Oh, S nine, you know, cause then people could do all this awesome OS nine shit and it would be cool.

1146
00:52:43,731 --> 00:52:50,470
Scott: And you know, who need, you know, OS 10, you know, keep it your closed source obviously, but you know, open source, the OS nine, it would be awesome.

1147
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:57,090
Scott: And everyone would do all this, you know, you'd be able to run OS nine apps, you know, or one through nine apps on, uh, Linux.

1148
00:52:57,270 --> 00:52:57,888
Scott: It would be totally cool.

1149
00:52:58,190 --> 00:53:03,730
Scott: And everyone would get all like these old Mac games and it'd be sweet and you wouldn't need to get like a Mac plus like I have in my closet.

1150
00:53:04,311 --> 00:53:04,610
Rym: All right.

1151
00:53:04,812 --> 00:53:05,349
Rym: I think we're done.

1152
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:06,206
Scott: We are done.

1153
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:15,069
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1154
00:53:15,330 --> 00:53:17,690
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music.

1155

1157
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:35,869
Rym: We say feeds plural because GeekNights airs four nights a week covering four different brands of geekery.

1158
00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:37,949
Rym: Mondays are science and technology.

1159
00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:40,530
Rym: Tuesdays we have video games, board games, and RPGs.

1160
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:46,470
Rym: Wednesdays are anime, manga, comic nights, and Thursdays are the catch alls for various rants and tomfoolery.

1161
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:54,909
Scott: You can send us feedback by email to GeekNights at frontrowcrew.com or you can send audio feedback via audio.

1162
00:53:55,430 --> 00:53:58,550
Scott: Just click the link that says send me an audio on the right side of our website.

1163
