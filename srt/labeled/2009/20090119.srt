1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,486
Scott: It's Monday January 19th.

2
00:00:11,787 --> 00:00:12,329
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:16,720
Scott: I'm Rym and this is GeekNights tonight the overclocking.

4
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:26,927
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:30,843 --> 00:00:34,475
Rym: Well, I duly celebrated the day of the dr.

6
00:00:34,555 --> 00:00:53,444
Rym: Reverend Martin Luther King jr By going skiing which as a guy at the ski resort said to me when they were celebrating MLK day Celebrate the blackest day in the world in a good way because he was this awesome black guy By doing the whitest thing in the world This big black dude.

7
00:00:53,464 --> 00:01:00,303
Scott: apparently that this awesome like I'm the only kind of guy because at the same time right it's like Skeeto is good.

8
00:01:00,323 --> 00:01:04,275
Scott: Dad's got the double meaning of skiing snow white.

9
00:01:04,878 --> 00:01:18,949
Scott: but also Stereotypically white people are way more skiing than black Even though obviously that is not a hundred percent true because there was a black guy at the ski resort This guy was one of those like his face.

10
00:01:18,969 --> 00:01:20,094
Scott: It wasn't a resort as a mountain.

11
00:01:20,436 --> 00:01:21,240
Rym: No, it's also a resort.

12
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:21,803
Scott: Oh, really?

13
00:01:21,823 --> 00:01:22,446
Scott: Can you stay there?

14
00:01:22,546 --> 00:01:23,289
Scott: Yeah in the cabin.

15
00:01:23,691 --> 00:01:28,480
Rym: In fact it because of the economy It's you can get a nice condo like on the slopes.

16
00:01:28,581 --> 00:01:33,774
Rym: I don't want a condo on a log cabin for like the weekend Log cabin for the weekend is like a hundred bucks a person.

17
00:01:33,955 --> 00:01:34,700
Rym: really her night.

18
00:01:35,021 --> 00:01:35,866
Scott: Oh a per person.

19
00:01:35,886 --> 00:01:39,780
Scott: so ten people in one cabin is the same as ten people If you go in the normal ones.

20
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,067
Rym: You can also rent just a cabin and it's not that much like maybe For four or five hundred bucks total.

21
00:01:45,127 --> 00:01:48,340
Rym: we can have it for as many people as we can cram in for like a whole weekend.

22
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,152
Scott: See if you're all shushing, but I was sitting in the cabin going.

23
00:01:52,172 --> 00:01:53,215
Scott: I like having.

24
00:01:53,436 --> 00:01:54,620
Rym: actually they got this big.

25
00:01:55,322 --> 00:01:56,477
Scott: There's not much that I like.

26
00:01:56,517 --> 00:02:00,480
Rym: better They got all these like indoor pool.

27
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:04,259
Scott: I don't trust that because it might tip me out and spill me down the mountain while I'm sitting on the toilet.

28
00:02:06,142 --> 00:02:09,359
Rym: They also have for people who don't want to ski tubing with lifts.

29
00:02:10,661 --> 00:02:11,283
Scott: That's not too bad.

30
00:02:11,303 --> 00:02:14,314
Rym: you can like sled in two, but it's not even more dangerous though.

31
00:02:14,595 --> 00:02:15,960
Rym: It's on this tiny little like.

32
00:02:17,422 --> 00:02:18,728
Rym: You can't hurt yourself on that thing.

33
00:02:19,231 --> 00:02:21,220
Rym: That's me like the kids are there while the day.

34
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,417
Scott: It's like if you do that on a ski hill you're gonna die.

35
00:02:25,602 --> 00:02:27,026
Scott: I like sitting in log cabins going.

36
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:30,958
Scott: ah and I you know put on my little top hat pretend to be Abraham Lincoln.

37
00:02:31,118 --> 00:02:44,900
Rym: nope But this dude was like one of those old-school skiers like he had non-shaped skis But he had like these old like non-shaped skis which like I can't deal with those anymore.

38
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,978
Rym: Like I don't even understand how people can ski on them.

39
00:02:47,804 --> 00:02:50,800
Rym: And he there was this crowd like they had this cool event last night about it.

40
00:02:50,820 --> 00:03:03,698
Rym: They had fireworks on the slopes right after and then today at 4 I left before you know the slopes closed But then they had a rail jam which was basically come and show off in the terrain park on your snowboards.

41
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:14,740
Rym: Oh They have the halfpipe finished and all the awesome stuff, uh-huh yeah But I came home because I didn't want to be there all night especially in the dark in the cold outside.

42
00:03:14,882 --> 00:03:19,038
Rym: Well when I was a kid I never got to ski during the day because my parents didn't want to pay the 50 bucks.

43
00:03:19,761 --> 00:03:24,460
Rym: So they'd send me at night, and I'd ski from like 5 p.m.. To 10 p.m.. In the dark.

44
00:03:25,184 --> 00:03:27,559
Rym: I had a full face mask.

45
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:38,780
Rym: What it's cold, but skiing was a little easier this time since actually People were saying that it was like the nicest day of skiing Hunter Mountain has had in like five years.

46
00:03:39,543 --> 00:03:50,470
Scott: It was like it did like it snowed like a bunch, and then it snowed a little bit and then yeah The snow is so powdery that the shovel guys used Leaf blowers instead of shovels.

47
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:53,425
Rym: cuz I gotta tell you that when I got there You know I got there early.

48
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:59,492
Rym: people don't usually show up to ski into like 10, so it was me like 15 other people in that first half hour.

49
00:03:59,512 --> 00:04:01,480
Rym: it was virgin powder.

50
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,589
Rym: There was about three inches of that powder.

51
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:04,453
Rym: It was beautiful.

52
00:04:05,096 --> 00:04:06,000
Scott: Yeah, I understand.

53
00:04:06,181 --> 00:04:09,420
Rym: I really understand now why people are like all the powder all the powder.

54
00:04:10,161 --> 00:04:22,140
Scott: Thing is I watched a video of skiing in Iran and that is it was like a dollar and it was like He's just like mountain with like a crappy old lift and like a shit ton of snow.

55
00:04:22,682 --> 00:04:28,040
Rym: Well the cool thing was it sucked because it was a holiday technically so I had to pay the extra couple bucks.

56
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:35,007
Rym: It was like 65 bucks for my lift ticket mmm, but I could about a video game But good about two video games.

57
00:04:35,087 --> 00:04:39,700
Rym: it was MLK day like hardly anyone gets it off So there weren't that many people.

58
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:44,600
Scott: Okay, the thing is the train station was like empty and they ran a weekend schedule and the trains were empty.

59
00:04:45,302 --> 00:04:46,997
Scott: So someone must have had the day off.

60
00:04:47,098 --> 00:04:51,219
Rym: yeah Well like a lot of people in urban areas get the day off, but like not everyone does I?

61
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,135
Rym: Met like four different people today who all work in the stock market.

62
00:04:56,155 --> 00:04:57,420
Rym: They're like yeah stock holiday here.

63
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,875
Rym: Yeah, they all drove up from New York like well two of these people.

64
00:05:01,915 --> 00:05:03,200
Rym: they work down the street for me.

65
00:05:03,602 --> 00:05:04,428
Scott: Yeah, there you go.

66
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:05,717
Rym: Yeah, that was cool.

67
00:05:05,758 --> 00:05:09,329
Rym: But I Heard the same shoulder that I heard last time.

68
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:10,533
Rym: I just healed it.

69
00:05:10,794 --> 00:05:12,140
Scott: Maybe you should get a soldier surgery.

70
00:05:12,621 --> 00:05:14,327
Scott: No, get the baseball shoulder surgery.

71
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,010
Scott: It'll be stronger.

72
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:15,250
Scott: There's.

73
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:15,672
Rym: no it's.

74
00:05:15,913 --> 00:05:20,991
Rym: it's not the same thing, but you know, what's dumb I was doing like the Black Diamonds and I did.

75
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:26,960
Rym: I got in over my head a little bit But I never fell once and all the crazy hard slopes because I was trying real hard.

76
00:05:27,362 --> 00:05:28,406
Rym: I was real careful.

77
00:05:28,446 --> 00:05:31,480
Scott: Then you went on the bunny hill and you fell over during a lot of these hard slopes.

78
00:05:31,601 --> 00:05:34,277
Rym: I was thinking the whole time don't fall don't fall don't fall.

79
00:05:34,397 --> 00:05:38,920
Rym: Oh shit Once I came around on a it looked like it was an easy one.

80
00:05:39,061 --> 00:05:45,530
Rym: It was this Black Diamond, but like goes around this nice gentle like around the corner There's moguls, but I can just kind of avoid the moguls.

81
00:05:46,132 --> 00:05:53,215
Rym: and then I come around the corner like around this sharp Like hairpin turn and I turn and it's like straight down and I couldn't stop in time.

82
00:05:53,235 --> 00:05:54,720
Rym: So I went straight down.

83
00:05:55,245 --> 00:06:02,303
Rym: I must have been going like 50 miles an hour and then at the end there was a bump and I jumped like six feet in the air and In the air.

84
00:06:02,544 --> 00:06:04,594
Rym: my brain thought like like time slowed down.

85
00:06:04,634 --> 00:06:13,347
Rym: It was like heartbeat fuck heartbeat fuck Heartbeat, I think I'm gonna make it heartbeat.

86
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:14,029
Rym: Oh shit.

87
00:06:14,049 --> 00:06:15,673
Rym: There's another bump heartbeat.

88
00:06:15,814 --> 00:06:16,857
Rym: I'm in the air again.

89
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:22,748
Rym: I totally made it and I thought alright that was that was too much.

90
00:06:22,809 --> 00:06:23,752
Rym: That was I risked it.

91
00:06:23,772 --> 00:06:24,494
Rym: I made it.

92
00:06:25,377 --> 00:06:26,400
Rym: I'm gonna go eat some lunch.

93
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:33,731
Rym: so I go past the ski lift and I take like the easy bunny trail down and Then I totally fall out of my ass and hurt my shoulder.

94
00:06:33,751 --> 00:06:38,427
Rym: I'm like the bunny is bunny trail I told you because I wasn't paying attention.

95
00:06:38,487 --> 00:06:45,005
Rym: I was like, oh man, I'm such an awesome ski up BAM No one even saw it.

96
00:06:45,025 --> 00:06:48,180
Rym: I was all alone like in this little bunny trail like off by the side.

97
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,597
Rym: There's like the go slow family skiing area there.

98
00:06:51,697 --> 00:06:52,240
Rym: It's like man.

99
00:06:52,281 --> 00:07:00,389
Scott: That's something though If you're up on the mountain with not a lot of other people The ski patrol might not notice if you hurt yourself Because someone's gonna patrol will notice.

100
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:06,480
Rym: in fact because they patrol all the slopes like on a regular Basis and they spend a lot of time in the places where people tend to hurt themselves.

101
00:07:07,144 --> 00:07:09,320
Rym: And actually I was riding up with the ski patrol guy.

102
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,340
Rym: It was funny because the whole time like someone got hurt real bad actually.

103
00:07:13,763 --> 00:07:18,636
Rym: But I got to listen to his radio and he was like, yeah I can ignore it until I get to the top because what am I gonna do?

104
00:07:18,656 --> 00:07:19,219
Rym: I'm on the lift.

105
00:07:19,764 --> 00:07:21,599
Scott: Yeah, so that's the fastest way to the top.

106
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:25,399
Scott: It was constantly was like should have like an emergency button though that makes the lift go fast.

107
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:29,554
Rym: like Well, there is one lift that goes real fast.

108
00:07:29,614 --> 00:07:35,623
Rym: All the other ones go kind of slow but the whole time it was like Level whatever.

109
00:07:35,723 --> 00:07:38,751
Rym: someone reported hurt on this trail on this trail.

110
00:07:38,811 --> 00:07:40,075
Rym: send one guy send two guys.

111
00:07:40,456 --> 00:07:42,040
Rym: people got hurt like every two minutes.

112
00:07:42,741 --> 00:07:46,420
Scott: Yeah, that's that's how it's a dangerous thing shushing on the van.

113
00:07:46,701 --> 00:07:49,780
Rym: But I feel like if I had needed help on that bunny trail.

114
00:07:50,443 --> 00:07:54,480
Rym: I don't think they're patrolling that bunny trail because you can't hurt yourself on the bunny trail.

115
00:07:54,502 --> 00:07:59,540
Scott: Yeah I mean you could have landed face first in the snow and like just twisted your neck the wrong way by random chance.

116
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,660
Scott: I'm like maybe a hidden rock and then your face would have been in the snow.

117
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,949
Scott: You've been suffocating and bleeding and your teeth falling out.

118
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,956
Rym: There's no hidden rocks on the bunny.

119
00:08:06,976 --> 00:08:07,820
Scott: There's a hidden rock.

120
00:08:08,381 --> 00:08:08,903
Rym: There's nobody.

121
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:13,035
Rym: I put it there but yeah as a result, you know skiing.

122
00:08:13,115 --> 00:08:14,780
Rym: I've only skied a couple times this winter.

123
00:08:16,554 --> 00:08:22,600
Rym: I'm 27 now and I feel like that's old and I feel like my body I don't recover as quick like when I was a kid.

124
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,049
Rym: Like I would go skiing like from 5 p.m.

125
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:25,692
Rym: To 10 p.m.

126
00:08:25,732 --> 00:08:32,054
Rym: Like I'd fall over like a hundred times Like I would push myself to the limit and be on cartilage first bone.

127
00:08:32,073 --> 00:08:33,258
Scott: Yeah, we know about this.

128
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:34,845
Rym: the next day I'd feel great.

129
00:08:35,107 --> 00:08:40,288
Rym: In fact when I got home at like midnight, I'd feel great And then I'd stay out playing like the realm or something.

130
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,573
Rym: I don't feel so high right now.

131
00:08:42,835 --> 00:08:43,777
Rym: I gotta get some sleep.

132
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,732

00:08:49,676 --> 00:08:50,800
Rym: what do you have to be ill in about?

135
00:08:52,122 --> 00:08:54,600
Scott: Got in the train to go home, but I was just so tired.

136
00:08:57,382 --> 00:08:58,556
Rym: Maybe we should do a quick show.

137
00:09:00,521 --> 00:09:02,528
Rym: No, so, uh, it's tech day.

138
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:04,114

00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,835
Scott: I don't know if it's not it's not really a news, but I don't give a shit, right?

141
00:09:09,518 --> 00:09:13,484
Scott: So there's a guy and Let's see.

142
00:09:13,564 --> 00:09:14,511
Scott: Oh, it has his name here.

143
00:09:14,572 --> 00:09:22,700
Scott: His name is Matt Knox right like Fort Knox, but Matt and he is a quote talented Ruby instructor and coder.

144
00:09:23,501 --> 00:09:27,092
Scott: But in his early days, he worked for direct revenue.

145
00:09:27,132 --> 00:09:33,860
Scott: direct revenue was an adware company The one that got sued by Elliot Spitzer when he was still Attorney General of New York.

146
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,468

Scott: Yeah back when he was doing awesome before he started doing poop, right?

148
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:49,760
Scott: So this interview with this adware guy is like one of the most fascinating Articles that I've read in a long time because this guy is clearly a high quality computer scientist, right?

149
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:58,519
Scott: He talks about like and the way I can tell is because apparently he deployed scheme With the adware and he's pretty sure that's the largest scheme deployment ever.

150
00:09:59,801 --> 00:10:17,205
Scott: But he talks about how the adware worked and how they avoided removal and detection and how they were able to remove the other adwares and how Their adware was actually a little bit, you know still shady but a little bit more legitimate than the other adware Which is just blatantly hacking you.

151
00:10:17,225 --> 00:10:26,698
Scott: this would basically install when you installed it and uninstall when you uninstalled it It's just when it was installed it, you know kicked your ass and filled you with ads and shit.

152
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:30,336
Rym: Wow So there's a tiny amount of honor among thieves the funniest.

153
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:37,810
Scott: the funniest thing He talks about actually that I thought was the most interesting was how when he on when you uninstalled Right, which you could only do through their uninstall process.

154
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:40,460
Scott: No adware removers didn't do the trick, right?

155
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,848
Scott: They would put a registry key in.

156
00:10:43,189 --> 00:10:54,880
Scott: they had registry keys while it was installed But when they uninstalled they removed all the registry keys But they put one behind they left one behind and that one was so that their program would never install again.

157
00:10:55,603 --> 00:11:01,819
Scott: You know because if someone you know, so let's say you uninstalled and then you try to install again It would see that registry key and you'd be safe.

158
00:11:02,201 --> 00:11:07,819
Scott: Uh-huh, right, but adware removers were stupid and the adware removers would remove that registry key.

159
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:16,000
Scott: Thus if you would uninstall it by the normal means then use an adware remover and then it would install again.

160
00:11:16,671 --> 00:11:21,917
Rym: Wow Yeah, I can still only blame the spyware and not the adware removal software.

161
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:25,774
Scott: Of course, of course But you know, it's weird how the world went from.

162
00:11:25,794 --> 00:11:32,060
Rym: adware removal Didn't need to exist - it existed in works - it really just doesn't work anymore.

163
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:42,040
Scott: Like if you really get if you get any virus or any adware or anything You can use a tool to remove it and you might be pretty sure that it's removed.

164
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:46,840
Scott: You can do a lot of things to look and see if it's removed, you know, you can do some Wireshark.

165
00:11:46,981 --> 00:11:50,980
Scott: I guess it's called to look at you know, your network traffic to see if any spyware is going out.

166
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,860
Rym: Yes, Ethereal was renamed to Wireshark due to a - I should tell that story on a Monday show sometime.

167
00:11:56,021 --> 00:12:03,430
Scott: Yeah, you know, but you know, you can do all sorts of things to check if the adware was removed But you can't be a hundred percent sure.

168
00:12:03,631 --> 00:12:11,320
Scott: you could be a hundred percent sure you've got it But no matter how many cleaners you run you can never be a hundred percent sure you've gotten rid of it.

169
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:16,640
Scott: You can be like 90% sure like hey, I ran three adware removal tools and two virus tools.

170
00:12:17,442 --> 00:12:18,548
Scott: They don't detect anything.

171
00:12:18,829 --> 00:12:20,901
Scott: You can be 90% sure you got rid of it 100%.

172
00:12:20,901 --> 00:12:29,816
Rym: the ways to be 100% sure are ways that involve external checking that are also 100% impractical.

173
00:12:29,997 --> 00:12:43,587
Scott: Yes so if you get any virus or any malware any adware my recommendation to you is to just erase your entire hard drive and then reinstall your operating system and You should have backups right because they.

174
00:12:44,028 --> 00:12:46,956
Scott: installing an operating system like takes 20 minutes.

175
00:12:47,237 --> 00:12:48,260
Scott: It takes no time at all.

176
00:12:48,402 --> 00:12:49,580
Scott: It's really really easy.

177
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:58,280
Scott: I mean Windows 7 actually like it still is not as easy as Ubuntu because you have to restart a few times But the it was really easy.

178
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:07,375
Scott: It was like they definitely learned from Ubuntu's installer and it's just as good as the Ubuntu installer despite having a couple extra Restarts and take it a little bit longer.

179
00:13:07,415 --> 00:13:08,140
Scott: That's the only difference.

180
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:08,501
Scott: so

181
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:23,134
Rym: people one thing to keep in mind if you've got a Windows box, I've said this before ever everyone smart says this but Install Windows on the C partition and give it enough space and always give it a bunch of extra because it's gonna need more Space and like temp files and things.

182
00:13:23,174 --> 00:13:24,000
Rym: you don't want to mess with that.

183
00:13:24,282 --> 00:13:25,212
Rym: There are ways around that.

184
00:13:25,253 --> 00:13:33,360
Rym: but don't bother Make another partition and put all your other data like your mp3s and crap there.

185
00:13:34,143 --> 00:13:42,463
Rym: Yep, that way you can reinstall without losing any of that And as long as nothing on that drive is executables or even if they are Executables.

186
00:13:42,483 --> 00:13:46,100
Rym: if they don't get run again, then you can just reinstall the OS and not lose anything.

187
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,770
Rym: But you know all the application stuff you've got to reinstall.

188
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:51,720
Scott: Yeah, and it's reinstalling applications is cake.

189
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,675
Scott: I mean, what do you really have to install like Firefox an instant message clients?

190
00:13:55,695 --> 00:13:57,020
Scott: Let's say pigeon, right?

191
00:13:57,862 --> 00:14:03,649
Scott: You know some Firefox extensions flash Maybe a bit torrent client right.

192
00:14:03,669 --> 00:14:05,258
Scott: that takes what like 20 minutes?

193
00:14:06,202 --> 00:14:09,969
Rym: Well, you might have some specialized stuff But even then even then you don't install it.

194
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:16,830
Scott: see people make the mistake when they reinstall their OS They sit there for hours and hours reinstalling every single program.

195
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:17,311
Scott: Don't do that.

196
00:14:17,853 --> 00:14:20,660
Scott: Just reinstall the programs as you use them.

197
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,786
Scott: So you're sitting at your computer.

198
00:14:21,806 --> 00:14:23,213
Scott: It's a brand new Windows, right?

199
00:14:23,555 --> 00:14:27,010
Scott: First thing you got to do I got to go to the web install Firefox.

200
00:14:27,632 --> 00:14:29,580
Scott: Oh, man, this ads install adblock.

201
00:14:29,963 --> 00:14:32,239
Scott: I got to talk to my friend now install aim.

202
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:38,817
Rym: I want to sync my iPod now install it and automatically make sure that you and it's kind of like.

203
00:14:39,118 --> 00:14:46,126
Rym: one of the main reasons reinstalling Windows always makes it fast like people say Vista or you know The new Windows 7 beta are super fast.

204
00:14:46,627 --> 00:14:50,700
Rym: take Windows 2000 and install it fresh and it's real fast.

205
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,849
Scott: Yeah, any windows is real fast - it's a fresh install.

206
00:14:53,909 --> 00:14:55,454
Scott: It just slows down over time.

207
00:14:55,674 --> 00:14:57,520
Rym: any NT based window, right?

208
00:14:57,941 --> 00:15:02,778
Scott: I mean Windows 7 if you actually used it for a long time might get slow might?

209
00:15:02,838 --> 00:15:05,974
Scott: we don't know I mean, but every other Windows has.

210
00:15:05,994 --> 00:15:08,825
Rym: yeah, but It's kind of like.

211
00:15:08,966 --> 00:15:11,260
Rym: part of what reinstalling does is you start with the clean slate.

212
00:15:11,602 --> 00:15:15,120
Rym: So why not always try to keep your computer as clean slate as possible?

213
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,689
Scott: Oh the one thing you should yeah The one thing you shouldn't wait on is Windows updates.

214
00:15:18,729 --> 00:15:21,540
Scott: do every single Windows update immediately all the time.

215
00:15:21,862 --> 00:15:23,620
Rym: Yeah, it's pretty much when I install a computer.

216
00:15:24,144 --> 00:15:26,300
Rym: It's all the windows updates and you know.

217
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:36,640
Rym: Well first if they're you know, the motherboard driver if you have a motherboard driver or any of those things Yeah, and then well Windows update now actually takes care of your drivers like it takes care of like from my computer.

218
00:15:37,021 --> 00:15:38,846
Scott: It does the real Nvidia driver.

219
00:15:38,866 --> 00:15:41,975
Scott: It does like the real network card driver.

220
00:15:42,036 --> 00:15:42,577
Scott: It does like.

221
00:15:42,657 --> 00:15:43,580
Scott: it takes care of that shit.

222
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,145
Scott: It's pretty good.

223
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:47,489
Rym: But yeah, anyway This is a real.

224
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:48,519
Rym: I actually read this too.

225
00:15:49,081 --> 00:16:08,207
Scott: The computer science parts of the article are just really fascinating like how the like the windows process security flaws and All these, you know file system tricks where he's like using Unicode in the registries that the keys can't be seen and it's While he's doing evil things.

226
00:16:08,528 --> 00:16:12,300
Scott: the techniques that he's using are like like really amazing.

227
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:18,784
Rym: It's just really cool to see it from this perspective where it's not like reverse engineering or speculating or you know Figuring out what they did.

228
00:16:18,824 --> 00:16:22,478
Rym: It's someone saying this is what we did and why check it out.

229
00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:31,372
Rym: Yep but in other news this I don't want to talk about this in super depth because the issues that would be brought up are many.

230
00:16:31,432 --> 00:16:45,970
Rym: I mean we could do a whole show about this, but There is a a problem that Barack Obama is Running into whereby due to the way our government works and the way technology is and the way politics are He has a blackberry.

231
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,680
Rym: he's a hip tech guy like he's.

232
00:16:49,722 --> 00:16:58,000
Scott: Yes, people I mean he's probably not a computer science genius, but I think he has some Smart tech people working for him and he knows enough.

233
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:58,481
Scott: He's not.

234
00:16:58,582 --> 00:17:10,579
Scott: he doesn't know as much as us but he knows more than any president ever and possibly and significantly more than most other Federal elected officials, he knows more than most of the congressman and he knows a lot.

235
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,150
Rym: I'm pretty sure I would call him computer literate.

236
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:13,732
Scott: Definitely.

237
00:17:13,752 --> 00:17:15,780
Rym: In fact, he's probably above average in that regard.

238
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,446
Scott: But yeah, he can rock the face.

239
00:17:17,487 --> 00:17:18,570
Scott: He can make a podcast.

240
00:17:18,852 --> 00:17:20,900
Scott: He can rock a Facebook and he can send a blackberry.

241
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,638
Scott: That's more than George Bush with his AOL's.

242
00:17:25,221 --> 00:17:25,983
Rym: That's the problem.

243
00:17:26,022 --> 00:17:34,013
Rym: He uses a blackberry and the Secret Service and the government and everyone are basically saying Barack You can't keep using the blackberry.

244
00:17:34,395 --> 00:17:40,759
Rym: for all these reasons Security is a concern and data retention is a concern and privacy is a concern.

245
00:17:40,779 --> 00:17:47,540
Rym: and He got a bunch of lawyers together and he was trying to fight to say look how can we get around this?

246
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,967
Rym: I really want my blackberry.

247
00:17:49,048 --> 00:17:51,160
Scott: I like to see the thing was he got a bunch of lawyers.

248
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,987
Scott: He should have gotten a bunch of computer scientists.

249
00:17:53,629 --> 00:17:54,633
Scott: They would have figured it out.

250
00:17:55,095 --> 00:17:56,560
Rym: No, it's not a matter of figuring it out.

251
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,950
Rym: It's not a matter of having a technological solution.

252
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,215
Rym: This is the root problem here.

253
00:18:00,236 --> 00:18:04,540
Rym: No Technological solution is even on the table.

254
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:16,592
Rym: The problem is the politics and the bureaucracy and the fact that our government is a government of Luddites, I mean Congress is so technologically archaic.

255
00:18:17,174 --> 00:18:17,997
Rym: It's not laughable.

256
00:18:18,037 --> 00:18:22,431
Rym: It's frightening and What bothers me and this just kind of brings it all to light.

257
00:18:22,472 --> 00:18:22,713
Rym: is that?

258
00:18:23,316 --> 00:18:24,240
Rym: why isn't there?

259
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:29,040
Rym: Why do people need to use a blackberry if you're the president or you're in Congress?

260
00:18:29,881 --> 00:18:42,800
Rym: Shouldn't there be a blackberry equivalent that is just for people in the federal government in that is Encrypted and controlled by the government and everything's archived and you know keeps it forever super secure?

261
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:49,780
Scott: Yeah, I mean every even the crappiest offices in you know, like just just normal offices have exchange servers, right?

262
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,892
Scott: Why doesn't Congress at least have an exchange server?

263
00:18:53,193 --> 00:18:53,796
Rym: But what no?

264
00:18:53,836 --> 00:18:54,680
Rym: go one step further?

265
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,340
Rym: Why don't they at least at least I'm talking about portable.

266
00:18:57,821 --> 00:19:09,475
Rym: Imagine if and this wouldn't even cost that much to do the government designed or hired people to design a Blackberry like device that was only to be used by high government officials.

267
00:19:09,495 --> 00:19:10,860
Scott: You wouldn't even need a different device.

268
00:19:11,282 --> 00:19:16,206
Rym: No, no make up make a new device, you know that way it meets all though There's a lot of weird standards and things.

269
00:19:16,828 --> 00:19:24,695
Rym: you just put different software on an existing device you could but then they always worry about Who makes the devices and they could be compromised at the hardware firmware level.

270
00:19:24,756 --> 00:19:25,619
Scott: and oh, it's BS.

271
00:19:26,101 --> 00:19:27,549
Rym: No stuff like that has happened before.

272
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:28,635
Scott: let's get the palm free.

273
00:19:28,696 --> 00:19:29,460
Scott: No one knows about it.

274
00:19:29,821 --> 00:19:36,800
Rym: Yeah, but anyway, the idea is what if every member of Congress had a special blackberry like device that was super RSA style.

275
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,455
Rym: Whatever encryption, you know three-factor authentication, you know thumbprint pin.

276
00:19:41,676 --> 00:19:43,000
Scott: No Congress people would know how to use it.

277
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,259
Scott: It'd be like that doctor who threw his printer in the garbage.

278
00:19:45,562 --> 00:19:51,859
Rym: Well, you force them to use it and you make it anyway Even if they don't use it eventually they'll all die and there will be people who will use it.

279
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,245
Rym: Yeah, I mean think of this.

280
00:19:53,386 --> 00:19:54,591
Scott: by then though.

281
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:55,717
Scott: We won't have that anymore.

282
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:56,460
Scott: We'll have something better.

283
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,282
Scott: So it would have been a waste?

284
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:08,814
Rym: no wouldn't because then that member Congress will still be a whole technological generation behind and having this Even in a primitive form in the future is better than what they'll have.

285
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:09,878
Rym: Otherwise in the future.

286
00:20:09,898 --> 00:20:19,720
Rym: Yeah But I mean imagine if right now if Congress is out of session and there's an emergency What the president can do something but it's gonna take a while to get Congress together.

287
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,336
Rym: What if they all got paged on a little blackberry?

288
00:20:22,557 --> 00:20:28,898
Rym: they open it They can read these super secret important thing and then they can like vote on the emergency thing right then and there

289
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:30,038
Scott: because we wouldn't be on c-span

290
00:20:31,081 --> 00:20:38,816
Rym: Doesn't matter it's archived and then have the semi live redacted RSS and Twitter feed of what's going on in Congress.

291
00:20:39,177 --> 00:20:48,733
Rym: Yeah Just this the fact that this is an issue Opens up a whole bunch of problems that are just.

292
00:20:48,853 --> 00:20:53,719
Rym: our government does not use technology efficiently and if it did we could solve all of these problems trivially.

293
00:20:53,739 --> 00:20:58,957
Rym: and I don't want to talk about this news anymore because I really think we just need to have a computer.

294
00:20:59,017 --> 00:20:59,680
Scott: be the government.

295
00:21:00,322 --> 00:21:11,072
Scott: You know like in every bad sci-fi where eventually the computer decides to kill everyone like paranoia or you know, Phoenix future It'll take it a while before it tries to kill everyone.

296
00:21:11,293 --> 00:21:11,534
Rym: Yeah.

297
00:21:11,694 --> 00:21:11,915
Scott: Yeah.

298
00:21:11,935 --> 00:21:12,960
Scott: So in the meantime, it's great.

299
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,120
Scott: I mean, how do you think those places end up like that?

300
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,547
Scott: You know, how do you end up in Logan's run?

301
00:21:16,728 --> 00:21:21,350
Scott: because the computer is great for a long time So everyone loves it and then eventually it turns evil.

302
00:21:21,451 --> 00:21:23,660
Rym: Are you are you implying that the computer is evil?

303
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,607
Rym: Do you not trust the computer?

304
00:21:25,988 --> 00:21:27,213
Rym: Are you not a happy citizen?

305
00:21:27,233 --> 00:21:29,782
Scott: No, because by the time the computer turns evil I'll be dead.

306
00:21:29,903 --> 00:21:31,047
Scott: So it's all good.

307
00:21:31,127 --> 00:21:33,294
Rym: But implying that the computer could turn evil.

308
00:21:33,956 --> 00:21:35,020
Rym: Are you a communist?

309
00:21:37,478 --> 00:21:43,306
Rym: No I Deny the fact that they're communist.

310
00:21:43,326 --> 00:21:43,908
Scott: Well, I like.

311
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:45,753
Scott: I like free market computing.

312
00:21:45,974 --> 00:21:47,820
Scott: you like equal opportunity computing.

313
00:21:50,347 --> 00:21:59,480
Rym: But yeah I want to do a show about this sometime in the future because I have like six points That each of which will take me a while to get out related to this article.

314
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:04,140
Rym: But suffice to say read this article and read all the concerns that they have pointed out.

315
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:33,700
Rym: I mean, there are a lot of concerns rain and the one that bothers me is they're worried that If the president uses something like a blackberry then everything he does personal would be recorded somewhere and then later Maybe that could all be dug up in case he was doing shady stuff to which I say good Transparency, I feel like if you're a government official There should be a certain expectation that you give up a lot of your privacy as long as you are Something like a president or a member of Congress.

316
00:22:33,861 --> 00:22:39,360
Rym: Like I feel like one of the prices of doing the job is think about a lot of your rights while you're doing the job.

317
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,767
Scott: Yeah, well, I mean think about this right?

318
00:22:40,908 --> 00:22:43,060
Scott: I work for my boss, right?

319
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,053
Scott: Well while I work for you know, my boss my boss can look at my work email.

320
00:22:48,073 --> 00:22:50,200
Scott: All right, and whatever right?

321
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,585
Scott: now if You're the president Everyone is your boss.

322
00:22:57,067 --> 00:23:00,740
Scott: So everyone should be able to see your work email.

323
00:23:00,961 --> 00:23:01,765
Scott: Now you do have.

324
00:23:02,106 --> 00:23:05,020
Scott: there are no email for example outside of work.

325
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:16,640
Rym: There are other exceptions to for example the email that you send saying effectively So the agents that are stationed in X are doing Y for Z right now, correct?

326
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,993
Rym: We got to hold off on that until that situation is resolved.

327
00:23:20,114 --> 00:23:21,560
Rym: Yeah, I'm okay with that.

328
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,312
Scott: You don't need to show it to everyone.

329
00:23:23,412 --> 00:23:25,784
Scott: You just need to Put it somewhere.

330
00:23:26,065 --> 00:23:29,558
Rym: Yes on a hard drive and then wait until you know, it doesn't matter anymore.

331
00:23:29,598 --> 00:23:30,240
Rym: then reveal it all.

332
00:23:31,121 --> 00:23:35,114
Scott: Our government in general is just terrible about waiting and then showing.

333
00:23:35,154 --> 00:23:36,438
Scott: it's like they just wait forever.

334
00:23:36,518 --> 00:23:37,080
Scott: They never show.

335
00:23:37,321 --> 00:23:38,465
Scott: There's like World War one shit.

336
00:23:38,485 --> 00:23:39,028
Scott: They haven't shown.

337
00:23:39,048 --> 00:23:40,614
Scott: it's like what the fuck guys is.

338
00:23:40,634 --> 00:23:41,940
Scott: it doesn't matter anymore.

339
00:23:42,121 --> 00:23:43,485
Scott: Yes cough it the fuck up.

340
00:23:43,726 --> 00:23:45,311
Scott: It's of historical significance.

341
00:23:45,351 --> 00:23:46,375
Rym: what so we betrayed?

342
00:23:46,435 --> 00:23:48,000
Scott: it's not historically significant.

343
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,344
Scott: What's your reason to hide it?

344
00:23:50,086 --> 00:23:51,471
Rym: So we betrayed the Prussians.

345
00:23:51,651 --> 00:23:54,400
Rym: so under whoopty freakin do there's no more Prussia.

346
00:23:54,922 --> 00:23:57,512
Scott: Yeah, what are they gonna do about it once something's old?

347
00:23:57,573 --> 00:23:58,818
Scott: I don't care how secret it is.

348
00:23:58,878 --> 00:23:59,340
Scott: cough it up.

349
00:23:59,641 --> 00:24:03,780
Rym: But anyway read the articles and sometime in the future we're gonna talk about this in more depth.

350
00:24:10,206 --> 00:24:12,020
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

351
00:24:12,101 --> 00:24:14,960
Rym: We'll see how long we go in this episode since we're both kind of fading fast.

352
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,531
Scott: Well speaking of government not doing so well with technology FCC.

353
00:24:18,873 --> 00:24:24,206
Rym: Ah the FCC You should be disbanded and remade.

354
00:24:24,607 --> 00:24:26,211
Scott: Yeah, did I use this already?

355
00:24:26,291 --> 00:24:26,773
Scott: Oh crap.

356
00:24:27,274 --> 00:24:28,016
Rym: Ah, good job.

357
00:24:28,116 --> 00:24:28,698
Scott: Let me go check.

358
00:24:28,718 --> 00:24:29,600
Scott: good game.

359
00:24:30,042 --> 00:24:31,167
Rym: Alright, I'll talk about mine.

360
00:24:31,248 --> 00:24:32,935
Rym: So this is just a picture.

361
00:24:32,956 --> 00:24:33,860
Rym: That's all it is.

362
00:24:34,522 --> 00:24:37,411
Rym: It's I'm pretty sure it's World War one vintage.

363
00:24:38,093 --> 00:24:40,440
Rym: I'd imagine it's in Britain.

364
00:24:41,243 --> 00:24:41,605
Rym: Just this.

365
00:24:41,685 --> 00:24:45,020
Rym: I'm guessing that it's in Britain, but it could theoretically be somewhere else.

366
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:58,980
Rym: I'm gonna go with Britain and it's a whole bunch of kids and a few soldiers and things all wearing gas masks Doing a parade and they've got a little like machine gun and a bunch of flags and a little armored car.

367
00:24:59,822 --> 00:25:00,849
Scott: I'm not an armored car.

368
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,340
Rym: I'm not really sure of the context.

369
00:25:03,103 --> 00:25:04,480
Rym: I'm not really sure what's going on.

370
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:11,519
Rym: If this is a demonstration a photo op a drill what but it is one of the creepiest pictures I've ever seen.

371
00:25:12,081 --> 00:25:23,394
Rym: Mm-hmm World War one gas masks are one of the few things that creep me out just a little bit Like it's very scary like it may if I woke up, you know Just like I woke up in the morning and I saw a World War one gas mask.

372
00:25:23,976 --> 00:25:26,511
Rym: I might yell At least a little.

373
00:25:26,612 --> 00:25:31,535
Scott: I should get one Hanging on the ceiling in your room or wear it in the morning.

374
00:25:31,856 --> 00:25:32,279
Scott: wake you up.

375
00:25:32,604 --> 00:25:33,118
Rym: Well, it's like that.

376
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:47,279
Rym: We had a friend at RIT was afraid of clowns and we always had this sinister idea of getting a little chip with a speaker That would play very quietly And just leave it somewhere in his bedroom to activate like a week later.

377
00:25:48,681 --> 00:25:53,219
Rym: Yeah, that's very much like truck one of those things that's funny, but you never actually do it because it doesn't actually work.

378
00:25:53,581 --> 00:25:54,225
Scott: It could work.

379
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,359
Rym: I've never seen truck work.

380
00:25:56,641 --> 00:25:59,838
Scott: Anyway, so the FCC if I did this already, fuck you.

381
00:25:59,898 --> 00:26:00,220
Scott: I'm tired.

382
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:12,319
Scott: Basically we complain about the FCC now because of stupid shit like, you know Censorship of radio and broadcast television, which is I say not their area.

383
00:26:12,701 --> 00:26:14,159
Scott: But they should not be dealing with that.

384
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,547
Scott: All right, they should only be concerned with.

385
00:26:16,588 --> 00:26:31,395
Scott: you know, two people on the same frequency fucking each other up, you know They also have a lot of other problems, you know allowing cable television cartels Not doing net neutrality and making you know, ISPs utility.

386
00:26:31,495 --> 00:26:33,000
Scott: Oh, they're they're not so great.

387
00:26:33,361 --> 00:26:52,860
Scott: Right a lot of problems, but apparently most of these problems we see in the context of you know, the now apparently way back in 1974 as Former FCC general counsel Henry Geller did a paper called a modest proposal to reform the Federal Communications Commission.

388
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:57,675
Scott: So this shit has been fucked up for a long time like before cassette tapes.

389
00:26:57,815 --> 00:26:59,360
Scott: a long time, right?

390
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,873
Scott: 1974 man, that's ancient.

391
00:27:02,517 --> 00:27:04,065
Scott: It's like Disco.

392
00:27:04,165 --> 00:27:10,800
Scott: and he was saying man FCC's fucked up when all they had was radio Speaking of which though disco needs to come back in a big way anyway.

393
00:27:11,282 --> 00:27:18,859
Scott: Well, the FCC can take care of that cuz they'll just regulate the radio and say no music except this But all this music can be yours.

394
00:27:19,764 --> 00:27:27,033
Scott: Anyway, only disco No, so there's this website called FCC dash reform org.

395
00:27:27,074 --> 00:27:45,350
Scott: that has this paper from 1974 which is just revealed as well as a lot of other videos and papers by prominent people of you know former FCC people intellectuals professors lawyers all kinds of people and they all say Basically FCC's corrupt got to fix it.

396
00:27:45,571 --> 00:27:46,595
Rym: Yeah, what's wrong?

397
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:47,619
Scott: Come on, let's go.

398
00:27:48,471 --> 00:27:55,305
Scott: So you know if you ever want to argue with someone or you know or want to have a discussion about the FCC and why it Needs to be reformed.

399
00:27:55,386 --> 00:27:57,980
Rym: point out that in our world have a discussion means argue.

400
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:05,637
Scott: Yeah, if you if you will thinking about writing a letter to like the FCC or your congressman to talk about reforming the FCC Cuz you know, there's a new Congress right now.

401
00:28:06,503 --> 00:28:07,228
Scott: Go to this site.

402
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:07,932
Scott: Do your research.

403
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:08,536
Scott: write a little letter.

404
00:28:08,556 --> 00:28:14,879
Scott: You're all good All right All right, so I'm pretty sure we didn't do a show on this already.

405
00:28:15,664 --> 00:28:21,800
Rym: We're not gonna talk that long about it either because we're fading fast But we'll probably do another show along similar lines in the future.

406
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:27,294
Rym: But got to talk a little bit about the OC the OC the overclock.

407
00:28:27,314 --> 00:28:37,586
Rym: You see I could make a graph of it's a graph that shows usefulness on one on the X Y axis and Year on the X axis.

408
00:28:38,087 --> 00:28:47,520
Scott: Yeah, see a lot of people out there, you know, they like computer hardware They like buying parts on Newegg putting a computer together, right and they like to overclock.

409
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,785
Scott: They overclock the video card.

410
00:28:48,825 --> 00:28:49,709
Scott: They overclock the CPU.

411
00:28:49,729 --> 00:28:52,560
Scott: They do a little RAM clock, right?

412
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:59,720
Scott: You know and I did that back in the day and I understand, you know how it could be sort of interesting and maybe fun.

413
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:22,419
Scott: But from a practical perspective if you are in the current day 2009 if you want to build a personal computer on the x86 platform All right, pretty much any plan actually any common personal computer architecture And you want to actually use that computer for a long time and get your money's worth.

414
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,040
Scott: Overclocking is really stupid.

415
00:29:26,722 --> 00:29:31,138
Rym: Now before anyone gets, you know, I'll get their pennies in a wad or any of that.

416
00:29:31,419 --> 00:29:34,474
Rym: just Hobbyist overclocking is cool.

417
00:29:34,494 --> 00:29:35,018
Rym: Like any other.

418
00:29:35,058 --> 00:29:43,540
Scott: Yeah I mean when you see like, you know new egg guys doing a Demonstration where they get like the liquid nitrogen out and they get the CPU up to like eight gigahertz.

419
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,005
Scott: So some crazy shit going on.

420
00:29:45,426 --> 00:29:49,640
Scott: That's cool, but they never intended that computer to actually be used.

421
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:58,940
Scott: They just did it for you know, the demonstration purposes, you know That wasn't a computer that you saved up fifteen hundred dollars for and bought and now plan to play games on for five years.

422
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:05,040
Scott: All right, that was a computer for a cool demonstration in which case overclocking is a pretty neat demonstration.

423
00:30:05,882 --> 00:30:09,813
Rym: Now the reason overclocking isn't really why it's not useful anymore.

424
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:12,300
Rym: Is that one for most purposes?

425
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:25,191
Rym: Computers are a lot faster than you need them to be and for gaming It's so cheap to upgrade like the time it takes to overclock and set up the cooling and then the risk Versus buying a new component like a good example is.

426
00:30:25,271 --> 00:30:28,120
Rym: I did try overclocking my video card my current video card.

427
00:30:28,461 --> 00:30:30,709
Rym: I have a g4 7900 whatever.

428
00:30:30,729 --> 00:30:33,900
Rym: No, and it's it's not really fast enough.

429
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:47,117
Rym: like if I play left for dead every now and then my frame rate will drop and And like fallout 3 the frame rate drops in like four different places where it really gets to me Like four parts of the game like in the tree plays like I can't walk around in there.

430
00:30:47,197 --> 00:30:47,920
Rym: It's really bad.

431
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:51,593
Rym: You can turn the settings down, you know, yeah, but I didn't really want to do that.

432
00:30:51,693 --> 00:30:53,580
Scott: So that's what they're there for.

433
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:59,786
Rym: So for on a lark I use the utility and I overclock my video card and I got about 10 more frames a second.

434
00:31:00,388 --> 00:31:07,759
Rym: and then I looked online and I can buy a video card that will get me Way more than 10 more frames a second for like 80 bucks.

435
00:31:08,271 --> 00:31:14,880
Rym: Yep See like back in the day and while it was overclocked my case overheated an hour later.

436
00:31:15,201 --> 00:31:20,022
Scott: Yeah, while right back in the day like a quality video card was $300.

437
00:31:20,022 --> 00:31:22,729
Scott: But right now you can go and buy an Nvidia 9800 GT for like 120 bucks.

438
00:31:22,749 --> 00:31:24,293
Scott: That's pretty much.

439
00:31:24,313 --> 00:31:36,440
Scott: I have an 8800 GT with my 8800 GT and my middle-of-the-road core to duo I think three gigahertz core to duo no overclocking whatsoever.

440
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,089
Scott: Completely standard retail cooling equipment, right?

441
00:31:40,971 --> 00:31:44,100
Scott: I can play the crisis demo the infamous crisis.

442
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:53,187
Scott: I played the demo with everything turned all the way up at 1680 by 1050 at Vertical sync with no drop-offs.

443
00:31:53,268 --> 00:31:58,226
Scott: if I would have had a 9800 GT instead of the 8800 GT It would only be better than that.

444
00:31:58,246 --> 00:32:02,902
Scott: And this is also on the infamous Vista, which is less performance Right.

445
00:32:03,244 --> 00:32:07,459
Scott: So why would I overclock if I can get you know max?

446
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:14,372
Scott: Basically performance in what I'm gonna do with Standard equipment in this case.

447
00:32:14,413 --> 00:32:20,798
Rym: There is one Situation where overclocking might be somewhat useful But then again, it's a calculated risk and you really got to think about it.

448
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:31,094
Rym: Say you're in late high school or early college and you all your gamer Gaming PC's a little old and you're real poor like right now for us.

449
00:32:31,455 --> 00:32:32,940
Rym: We have plenty of money in no time.

450
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:38,440
Rym: So overclocking is completely dumb because for the time it takes to overclock I could make enough money in my job.

451
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,166
Rym: You just buy all the components.

452
00:32:40,828 --> 00:32:42,935
Scott: and I mean if I bought nothing but computers.

453
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:47,210
Scott: Oh My god, I could buy like five computers a month.

454
00:32:47,451 --> 00:32:49,860
Rym: and I remember like one thing I did at RIT a couple times.

455
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:52,680
Rym: I just sat down and thought and they would all be the god of God.

456
00:32:52,761 --> 00:32:55,967
Rym: I thought if money were no object What kind of computer would I build?

457
00:32:55,987 --> 00:33:00,820
Rym: I would build like an $8,000 computer online and just look at it nowadays.

458
00:33:02,128 --> 00:33:05,067
Rym: even then $4,000 is a supercomputer.

459
00:33:05,148 --> 00:33:10,785
Scott: I bought an $800 desktop and I bought it about a $2,000 laptop But it's not $2,000 anymore.

460
00:33:10,885 --> 00:33:14,297
Rym: My current computer is $1,200 including the widescreen.

461
00:33:14,317 --> 00:33:15,240
Scott: Yeah, I guess that's tough.

462
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:23,513
Scott: Yeah If I'm not counting my monitor or my speakers or any of my other equipment that I brought over from the past plus I went Real high-end on this computer when I bought it.

463
00:33:23,593 --> 00:33:27,573
Rym: so not on the video card though No, but at the time this computer is real old.

464
00:33:27,694 --> 00:33:29,803
Rym: actually now, it's over a year old You should just buy the 9800 GT.

465
00:33:29,843 --> 00:33:31,549
Scott: I was talking about I'm going to.

466
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:34,600
Rym: actually I bought this computer the one I'm using now.

467
00:33:34,701 --> 00:33:40,253
Rym: That's still stupidly fast When I still work to that hospital, it's been way over a year.

468
00:33:40,274 --> 00:33:42,000
Rym: Mm-hmm, and it's doing fine.

469
00:33:42,060 --> 00:34:02,339
Rym: but yet if you if you have a lot more money than time and You're willing to either spend the time to research and make sure that your cooling is set up, right and you're willing to risk possibly having to reinstall windows after you screw it up and You are willing to risk the fact that you may screw up your hardware

470
00:34:03,321 --> 00:34:04,928
Scott: And have to buy a new computer then.

471
00:34:05,029 --> 00:34:14,947
Rym: Yeah overclocking isn't that bad of an idea But really only if you have more money than time or you're a hobbyist and you're doing it for the sake of doing it As opposed to for a practical reason, I

472
00:34:14,987 --> 00:34:25,960
Scott: guess there's also the case right where let's say you're poor right and but you have a computer, but it's not fast enough and You're willing to lose the computer, right?

473
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,485
Scott: So it's an old computer.

474
00:34:28,927 --> 00:34:33,620
Scott: you can overclock that beast and maybe try to make it more useful than it currently is.

475
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:36,280
Scott: You know, it's already old, you know.

476
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,570
Scott: But I guess you just have to be willing to recognize.

477
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:47,179
Rym: you might break it and have to buy a new one like old Athlon Like, you know the k7s the 800 megahertz the the durons and all those you can overclock the hell out of them.

478
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:47,783
Scott: I'll see that's the.

479
00:34:47,803 --> 00:34:51,300
Scott: that's the thing right back in our day in the earlier part of the decade.

480
00:34:51,481 --> 00:34:54,940
Scott: Right the Athlon era the Pentium 4 era, right?

481
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,587
Scott: It was like getting a chip.

482
00:34:57,627 --> 00:35:00,840
Scott: That was one step faster was a lot of money.

483
00:35:01,181 --> 00:35:03,411
Scott: Oh, and it wasn't just because we were poor in those days.

484
00:35:03,471 --> 00:35:04,917
Scott: It actually was a lot more money.

485
00:35:05,419 --> 00:35:19,180
Scott: So Overclocking, you know, if you looked at the price and performance and the risk of things and then that time in history Overclocking was a great idea because more likely than not it was gonna work, right?

486
00:35:19,509 --> 00:35:31,440
Rym: Yeah I mean think you're gonna get a huge performance increase in a time where software was a lot more demanding than Hardware could put up and you could hope like there were avenues of overclocking that don't matter as much now like back then.

487
00:35:32,022 --> 00:35:37,118
Rym: There were like the front side bus was like the biggest bottleneck in the world.

488
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,947
Rym: now It's not as much of a yeah.

489
00:35:38,987 --> 00:35:42,503
Scott: now with DDR like DDR3 It's not really a problem.

490
00:35:42,584 --> 00:35:51,491
Scott: so much the RAM speed, you know, but now with PCI x16 and you know instead of oh You know AGP 2x that's not really a problem either.

491
00:35:51,671 --> 00:35:51,932
Rym: Yep.

492
00:35:52,334 --> 00:35:52,595
Rym: Plus.

493
00:35:52,635 --> 00:35:56,830
Rym: I mean, I remember very specifically I had an Athlon 800 megahertz.

494
00:35:57,452 --> 00:36:03,210
Rym: the Athlon like gigahertz Was more than twice as much money at the time.

495
00:36:03,491 --> 00:36:11,934
Rym: so I could buy two of the chip I got and Wreck one of them and still be still and I could overclock it to be faster than the chip I didn't buy because it was too expensive.

496
00:36:12,319 --> 00:36:12,984
Rym: Yep So I did.

497
00:36:13,044 --> 00:36:15,603
Rym: I overclocked my 800 to about 933.

498
00:36:15,603 --> 00:36:27,954
Scott: but nowadays unless you're doing like Pixar type work or running Maya or something crazy or deck of like a giant painting in Photoshop or something like You like to play the benchmark game though only if you're playing it as a game.

499
00:36:27,994 --> 00:36:29,700
Rym: benchmarks are basically useless.

500
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:36,479
Scott: Yeah, unless you're doing something like that, right like a core 2 duo is gonna do everything you need hardware.

501
00:36:36,519 --> 00:36:38,387
Scott: these days It's way ahead of the software.

502
00:36:38,407 --> 00:36:45,754
Scott: That's why we're seeing this netbook surgeons because 90% of what people do can be accomplished with really low horsepower.

503
00:36:45,814 --> 00:36:52,473
Scott: So getting more horsepower Especially at the risk of having to spend more money is really bad idea.

504
00:36:52,513 --> 00:37:02,318
Scott: when you don't need the extra horsepower is suddenly Applications started getting more demanding again and suddenly, you know The chips weren't fast enough to do everyday things like they.

505
00:37:02,419 --> 00:37:07,460
Scott: you know They weren't fast enough in the olden days right where you'd get skipping just like watching a video or something.

506
00:37:08,062 --> 00:37:12,915
Scott: Then maybe overclock would become a good idea again, but it's not so it's not.

507
00:37:13,256 --> 00:37:13,577
Rym: of course.

508
00:37:13,678 --> 00:37:18,180
Rym: remember to I Like I did the crazy air cooling and like I set my case up awesome.

509
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:21,149
Rym: It sounded like a jet engine and I overclocked my AMD quite a bit.

510
00:37:21,711 --> 00:37:32,273
Rym: I also overclocked my video card quite a bit and that computer crash About twice a week when it was overclocked and it didn't.

511
00:37:32,373 --> 00:37:44,085
Rym: when it wasn't overclocked it also My windows installation due to these crashes would become corrupt to the point that I would have to reinstall About once every four months.

512
00:37:44,586 --> 00:37:47,072
Rym: Yep, and it was clearly due to the overclocking.

513
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:57,649
Rym: and in fact the overclocking and the heat Accelerated the death of my motherboard when eventually the capacitors exploded due to the Unrelated Chinese bootleg problem back in the day.

514
00:37:57,669 --> 00:38:05,680
Scott: Yeah nowadays if you get a motherboard with the solid-state capacitors That specific problem will be less but the unreliability is still a major issue.

515
00:38:07,022 --> 00:38:09,614
Scott: the other thing you got to worry about when the overclocking is the cooling.

516
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:14,173
Scott: the cooling is big because You know when you overclock something it's gonna make more heat.

517
00:38:14,233 --> 00:38:15,900
Scott: That's the reality of physics, right?

518
00:38:16,081 --> 00:38:18,748
Scott: So you want to make sure you have more cooling.

519
00:38:18,809 --> 00:38:22,720
Scott: if you overclock that way, you know, you got that extra safety there.

520
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,683
Scott: Maybe it'll even be a hundred percent reliable.

521
00:38:24,783 --> 00:38:25,605
Scott: Maybe right.

522
00:38:25,985 --> 00:38:31,367
Scott: The thing is if you buy say a Quad-core right it comes.

523
00:38:31,467 --> 00:38:33,676
Scott: if you buy a retail one it comes with this heatsink.

524
00:38:34,298 --> 00:38:37,256
Scott: that heatsink It comes with that has the Intel sticker on it.

525
00:38:37,336 --> 00:38:37,920
Scott: It's the Intel.

526
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:38,342
Scott: I guess it's.

527
00:38:38,362 --> 00:38:40,954
Scott: I don't know if Intel makes those things but it's Intel brand.

528
00:38:40,974 --> 00:38:46,500
Scott: heatsink is Super-quiet and can cool the chip perfectly if you don't overclock.

529
00:38:47,522 --> 00:38:50,579
Scott: So there's no reason to use anything else unless you overclock.

530
00:38:51,581 --> 00:39:02,280
Scott: Anything else is gonna be bigger and louder Unless you get water cooling in which case it will be quieter But it'll be a pain in the ass.

531
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:06,936
Scott: You're gonna risk getting water everywhere if you don't know what you're doing and it's gonna be real expensive.

532
00:39:07,437 --> 00:39:19,680
Scott: and you know Even with water cooling right water cooling might, you know be quieter and cooler But you have used more electricity on the stupid condenser thingy that cools the water.

533
00:39:20,502 --> 00:39:32,400
Rym: Well, the main reason I ever had for water cooling when I really thought about doing I ended up not doing it Was that I wanted a computer that was quiet so I could use it as a media PC, but now a Mac Mini is silent

534
00:39:32,922 --> 00:39:41,394
Scott: yeah, but even so if you have a computer in your room in the same room that you sleep in or even a different room than You sleep in it's still really like people don't you know?

535
00:39:41,434 --> 00:39:46,138
Scott: know until they have a quiet computer It's real nice to have a computer that doesn't make a lot of noise.

536
00:39:46,198 --> 00:40:08,020
Scott: I mean If you start like when I start playing a game, you know like when I play Fallout 3 the video card fans start going faster and faster and faster and they start to make a little bit of noise and it is Bothers them because like I hear them and they sort of interfere with the game I'm playing where I want to hear what's in the game, you know, so a quieter computer is always better.

537
00:40:08,763 --> 00:40:13,620
Scott: Oh, unless it's like a server rack kind of computer in which case, you know, it could be fucking loud as you want.

538
00:40:13,901 --> 00:40:17,235
Scott: Oh my god, every rack about computer is loud as all work.

539
00:40:17,275 --> 00:40:18,400
Rym: They were setting up some switches.

540
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:21,840
Scott: They're like new Cisco things and you turn them on and they're just so fucking loud.

541
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:26,622
Rym: Well when you turn them on at first because they have variable fan speed depending on the environment So they'll.

542
00:40:27,023 --> 00:40:31,636
Scott: they'll when they have variable span fan speed between jet engine and Concorde.

543
00:40:31,656 --> 00:40:32,900
Rym: No, they're actually pretty quiet.

544
00:40:33,462 --> 00:40:38,200
Rym: But when you turn them on before you can figure them they default to the fastest.

545
00:40:38,581 --> 00:40:44,239
Rym: So literally I hear this jet engine take off and everyone the whole office is looking like what the fuck is that?

546
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:51,208
Scott: Yeah, my computer when you turn it on like for a few seconds It goes full speed but then it comes back down.

547
00:40:51,288 --> 00:40:54,778
Scott: once the BIOS gets going, you know back to normal manage speed.

548
00:40:54,918 --> 00:40:56,949
Scott: Yep Yeah, I'll see.

549
00:40:56,969 --> 00:41:02,720
Scott: you gotta remember, you know your power supply Your video card and your CPU fan are the sources of most of the noise.

550
00:41:03,142 --> 00:41:06,279
Scott: So you really want to get quiet power supply quiet video card?

551
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:18,797
Scott: standard retail comes with the chip CPU fan for the maximum quietness and if Overclocking gets you like five frames a second, but as a result, everything's louder or more expensive.

552
00:41:19,178 --> 00:41:20,020
Scott: Was it really worth it?

553
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:29,191
Scott: I mean you could pay $50 for you know a water cooling kit or you could pay $50 For one chip faster than what you got.

554
00:41:29,773 --> 00:41:30,094
Scott: so what?

555
00:41:30,335 --> 00:41:31,700
Scott: why did you buy the water cool?

556
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,999
Scott: Okay, you could have just gotten a faster chip in the first place.

557
00:41:35,964 --> 00:41:40,139
Scott: Now water Overclocking for practical purposes is now dead.

558
00:41:40,842 --> 00:41:46,340
Scott: There's really no reason to do it anymore except for you know fun and not for actual computer use.

559
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:57,337
Scott: Yeah, and I see a lot of people buy new computers buy an extra heatsinks You know talking about how they're gonna overclock and these people do not have enough money to buy five computers a month.

560
00:41:57,959 --> 00:42:02,811
Rym: so The danger is not as much as it used to be.

561
00:42:02,931 --> 00:42:04,760
Rym: actually you're not it's not yes likely.

562
00:42:05,824 --> 00:42:07,069
Scott: Why take the risk?

563
00:42:07,169 --> 00:42:07,591
Scott: It's on.

564
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:10,000
Scott: it's like risk for no reason, you know.

565
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,146
Scott: It's might not be a big risk in some cases.

566
00:42:12,206 --> 00:42:15,416
Scott: It might only be a little risk, but it's greater than zero.

567
00:42:15,998 --> 00:42:16,660
Scott: Why bother?

568
00:42:17,141 --> 00:42:18,285
Scott: Why what is?

569
00:42:18,385 --> 00:42:20,531
Scott: what are you getting for it, you know, nothing.

570
00:42:20,612 --> 00:42:21,274
Scott: it's not worth it.

571
00:42:21,595 --> 00:42:24,702
Rym: but on that note going to bed I'm going immediately to bed.

572
00:42:31,112 --> 00:42:33,696
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

573
00:42:33,737 --> 00:42:35,840
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music.
