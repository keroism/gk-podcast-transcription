1
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,346
Rym: Hey, it's Monday July 27th.

2
00:00:11,626 --> 00:00:12,488
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,508 --> 00:00:14,693
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:14,794 --> 00:00:17,420
Rym: privacy security SSL and private keys.

5
00:00:25,874 --> 00:00:26,604
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,894 --> 00:00:31,396
Scott: You know what?

7
00:00:31,938 --> 00:00:34,530
Scott: what Scott was warm today?

8
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,283
Rym: about froze.

9
00:00:36,323 --> 00:00:40,542
Scott: mom Actually was warmer yesterday.

10
00:00:40,562 --> 00:00:51,621
Scott: Yes, it was so warm about melted my Today slightly less warm Still you know is the words today like work was just blah.

11
00:00:51,661 --> 00:00:52,704
Scott: everything sucked right.

12
00:00:52,784 --> 00:00:54,790
Rym: sudden random thunderstorm around lunchtime.

13
00:00:55,098 --> 00:01:01,110
Scott: No, no I like actually that part lunch was cool because they felt sorry for us at work being all Blair.

14
00:01:01,531 --> 00:01:05,163
Scott: So someone went out and got us some lunch with company monies, and they got me some.

15
00:01:05,203 --> 00:01:07,874
Scott: pancake is very nice pancake Yeah, lunch.

16
00:01:07,915 --> 00:01:08,781
Rym: Yeah, huh?

17
00:01:09,043 --> 00:01:13,388
Scott: Yeah it were really good pancakes - came with butter and syrup and everything.

18
00:01:13,508 --> 00:01:18,766
Scott: but No, and then you know I left work at 6 instead of a 5.

19
00:01:18,766 --> 00:01:19,710
Scott: I walk outside.

20
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:21,629
Scott: I didn't think it was gonna rain today.

21
00:01:22,231 --> 00:01:27,110
Scott: Right it was warm And it started drizzling a bit when I walked out the door and I didn't have an umbrella or a hood.

22
00:01:27,251 --> 00:01:29,946
Scott: Usually I have one of the other you know and as long as I had the umbrella.

23
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:33,644
Scott: I'm totally cool But if I have the hoodie it's like a but I'm least I'm alright.

24
00:01:33,785 --> 00:01:35,934
Rym: that didn't run in any rain But I was basically.

25
00:01:35,954 --> 00:01:38,725
Scott: the office is immediately started raining, and then it rained harder and harder.

26
00:01:38,786 --> 00:01:41,639
Scott: as I walk towards the train I was just like fuck man.

27
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,222
Rym: I was already.

28
00:01:42,242 --> 00:01:43,549
Scott: they work late, and then you rain on me.

29
00:01:43,832 --> 00:01:44,983
Rym: I was already like home by then.

30
00:01:45,024 --> 00:01:45,609
Rym: there was no rain.

31
00:01:45,851 --> 00:01:46,473
Scott: I know right.

32
00:01:46,554 --> 00:01:49,144
Rym: the funny thing is that crazy thunderstorm rolled through the city right.

33
00:01:49,626 --> 00:01:50,610
Rym: so I have my phone out.

34
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,190
Rym: Everyone's looking out the window cuz the lightning like struck near our buildings or super loud.

35
00:01:55,071 --> 00:02:02,008
Rym: So I look on like the weather radar And there's basically this tiny dot of red over New York City and nothing anywhere else.

36
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:06,389
Scott: yep Alright, I guess that's it for today's BS.

37
00:02:06,851 --> 00:02:13,783
Rym: But you know for anyone who is wondering what's going on here You know you might have seen us at Otakon where he did some amazing panels.

38
00:02:14,305 --> 00:02:15,490
Rym: GeekNights is four nights a week.

39
00:02:15,612 --> 00:02:19,559
Rym: This is Monday night Which is science and tech and neck beards and links and all that stuff.

40
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:27,757
Rym: so if you're looking for our coverage of Otakon or our Upcoming coverage of ConnectiCon or upcoming coverage of packs Otakon will be this Wednesday.

41
00:02:27,877 --> 00:02:33,637
Rym: packs will be some Tuesday in the future after you know after packs happens and You can listen if you want to.

42
00:02:33,677 --> 00:02:34,623
Rym: but this is Monday night.

43
00:02:34,663 --> 00:02:35,930
Rym: We talked about neck beards and Linux.

44
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:41,290
Scott: I'm curious as to where the neck beard meme started because you know did Darryl Surratt actually start that?

45
00:02:42,033 --> 00:02:43,218
Rym: The thing is that wasn't me.

46
00:02:43,238 --> 00:02:44,945
Scott: was it some or did he get it from somewhere?

47
00:02:45,006 --> 00:02:45,990
Rym: that was definitely.

48
00:02:47,115 --> 00:02:49,183
Scott: I heard neck beards on twit recently.

49
00:02:49,464 --> 00:02:50,870
Rym: really I wonder if it's spreading again.

50
00:02:50,991 --> 00:02:55,402
Scott: Yeah, yeah, actually John C Dvorak said throat beard and then switched it up to neck beard broke beard.

51
00:02:55,663 --> 00:02:58,512
Rym: that is clearly someone who heard it Didn't know?

52
00:02:58,532 --> 00:03:03,670
Scott: apparently people in the chat room in the Twitter chat room during the Twitter show or telling them throat beard neck beard.

53
00:03:04,176 --> 00:03:08,008
Scott: So, huh Yeah, I definitely some you know.

54
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,975
Scott: Awo GeekNights listeners.

55
00:03:10,135 --> 00:03:15,229
Rym: I recall very distinctly hearing the term at RIT long before GeekNights.

56
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:16,393
Scott: really I never did.

57
00:03:16,413 --> 00:03:17,978
Rym: I heard it more than once.

58
00:03:18,018 --> 00:03:24,080
Rym: in fact someone pointed out to me that I had grown a neck beard because I Had in fact yeah, I'm talking about in relation to Linux users.

59
00:03:24,362 --> 00:03:24,522
Rym: Well.

60
00:03:24,602 --> 00:03:26,510
Rym: I was at RIT, and I was the Linux user.

61
00:03:27,192 --> 00:03:33,650
Scott: Well my headphones just started working a lot more than they were a second ago, that's strange all right.

62
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:37,446
Rym: So you're gonna just throw that in there where I can't easily edit it out.

63
00:03:37,606 --> 00:03:40,318
Scott: Yeah, that's fine Okay, it's good for the show, but anyway.

64
00:03:40,398 --> 00:03:41,563
Scott: Oh, it's not protecting us.

65
00:03:41,623 --> 00:03:46,714
Scott: It's tech news tech stuff, but So long since we did any shows There's like just a bajillion.

66
00:03:46,754 --> 00:03:47,839
Scott: news is about everything.

67
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:56,824
Rym: a very interesting anecdote from work actually of all things all right relation to tech because you know when you get back from a long vacation and you know we haven't done a GeekNights in like a week and a half.

68
00:03:56,905 --> 00:04:03,470
Rym: but Yeah, I show back up at work And you always have that kind of conversation with the co-workers of yeah, so were there any disasters while I was gone?

69
00:04:04,616 --> 00:04:13,448
Rym: And there was but I can't get in all the details But the kind of thing that only happens in like a lab practical in college happened at my work while I was gone.

70
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:15,662
Rym: Wow Imagine a situation.

71
00:04:15,682 --> 00:04:20,459
Rym: we have three environments You know like a UAT environment a research environment and a production environment.

72
00:04:21,101 --> 00:04:48,289
Rym: the exact same problem the same symptom Happens in all three environments simultaneously, and the end result is that all three were Unrelated to one another despite the fact that at the level one and level two analysis They appeared to be the exact same problem and in fact there was an unrelated fourth error that was non Impacting in two of the three environments that was unrelated to either of the problems, huh?

73
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:51,850
Rym: This was like the kind of thing like in a class on the exam.

74
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:56,126
Rym: They'd be like what if blah happens and blah happens.

75
00:04:56,507 --> 00:04:57,150
Rym: What do you do?

76
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:01,810
Rym: What could it possibly be, but it was in the real world to see you investigate and eventually figure it out.

77
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:08,500
Rym: Well, they did well yes, because we're very smart, but this was one of those situations to where well I don't think most people could have solved it.

78
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,009
Scott: It was solved it with enough time.

79
00:05:10,512 --> 00:05:13,770
Rym: Yeah, we had to solve it before the market opens better than our problem at work.

80
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:14,051
Scott: We're.

81
00:05:14,071 --> 00:05:15,075
Scott: basically it's like well.

82
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:18,530
Scott: This is fixable with lots and lots and lots of working.

83
00:05:19,851 --> 00:05:21,922
Scott: There's no like answer that we can't solve.

84
00:05:21,962 --> 00:05:23,370
Scott: it's like we know exactly what's wrong.

85
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:27,150
Scott: It would just take incredible amounts of time and work to fix it, but this is what we do.

86
00:05:27,392 --> 00:05:40,750
Rym: This is like the equivalent of Imagine if images stopped working on like your outbound webs like your web server to the public on all your websites And it turned out that every website you run had its images broken independently by an unrelated problem.

87
00:05:40,891 --> 00:05:43,743
Rym: Yep, that was basically the equivalent of what we had to deal with.

88
00:05:43,783 --> 00:05:46,475
Scott: it's like you think it must be you But it's not you.

89
00:05:46,776 --> 00:05:48,704
Scott: every website out there had its images broke.

90
00:05:48,845 --> 00:05:53,580
Scott: Yes, all right, so Tech news right I guess we should talk about.

91
00:05:53,881 --> 00:05:56,950
Scott: you know there's like a bit of bajillion tech news over the past week or whatever.

92
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:07,145
Scott: But I think an actual one of the most pressing ones is very recent and that is the most obviously the flame war rific AT&T blocking a 4chan.

93
00:06:07,165 --> 00:06:10,090
Rym: now I don't know who said it first.

94
00:06:10,332 --> 00:06:18,790
Rym: I think it actually might have come from fast karate But someone equated AT&T fighting with 4chan as a t-rex fighting a massive bacterial infection.

95
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,788
Scott: Yeah, someone wrote that somewhere on the Internet's.

96
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:30,710
Scott: Basically the situation it seems like now that all the information is out it goes something like this right AT&T is an internet service provider.

97
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:40,304
Scott: Apparently there was a DDoS tech coming from within from AT&T ISP Subscribers to one particular 4chan server.

98
00:06:40,766 --> 00:06:45,084
Rym: I think it was the image server Which is as far as I can tell it's B, and I don't know what else.

99
00:06:45,285 --> 00:06:47,476
Scott: yeah bad stuff It's you know B.

100
00:06:47,537 --> 00:06:48,703
Rym: Definitely stands for bad.

101
00:06:48,723 --> 00:06:54,964
Scott: Yes, so AT&T saw this DDoS attack emerging from their network, so they blocked that.

102
00:06:55,084 --> 00:07:08,850
Rym: right of course what they blocked was you know I guess HTTP gets outgoing to that 4chan server or something like that now as far as I can tell it's more likely that they blocked that IP which just hosted the images for a couple of the boards on fortune.

103
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:14,450
Scott: Yeah, so anyone people are trying to go to 4chan who used AT&T as their ISP, and they couldn't get there.

104
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:17,970
Scott: It wouldn't work, and you know brings up all sorts of net neutrality.

105
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:21,072
Scott: It's like hey AT&T is not up to you to decide what sites I go to.

106
00:07:21,092 --> 00:07:26,790
Scott: and it's like even if there was a DDoS is it really up to AT&T to protect 4chan server?

107
00:07:26,911 --> 00:07:28,830
Scott: I mean it's 4chans problem.

108
00:07:29,312 --> 00:07:35,716
Rym: Well that more likely say they saw a DDoS arising from this and maybe just to protect their network They blocked it at the pairing level.

109
00:07:36,018 --> 00:07:36,621
Scott: That's true.

110
00:07:37,043 --> 00:07:38,590
Scott: It's true, but you know it's like.

111
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:39,633
Rym: I mean, what do you do?

112
00:07:39,673 --> 00:07:42,382
Rym: you you're caught between a brick and another.

113
00:07:42,402 --> 00:07:44,710
Scott: you couldn't you block it in another way?

114
00:07:44,811 --> 00:07:47,689
Scott: That would not prevent regular legitimate users from going to 4chan.

115
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:56,670
Rym: That's the nature of DDoS that because of the fact basically a proper like well-executed DDoS is indistinguishable from popularity.

116
00:07:57,434 --> 00:07:59,785
Scott: It's true absolutely 100% indistinguishable.

117
00:07:59,805 --> 00:08:00,650
Rym: There is no way to know.

118
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:04,490
Scott: I mean remember Google said when they go to the Michael Jackson searches they thought it was DDoS.

119
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:24,990
Rym: Yes And this is becoming more and more of a problem as the use of the internet and the use of media Democratizes and people become more tech savvy but sources of information are still confined to a very relatively small number of web sites and Data flows are confined to relatively small number of peers and small number of IPs and small number of aggregation points.

120
00:08:25,473 --> 00:08:32,630
Rym: People think that the internet is like this you know end to end But really it's very tiny endpoints connecting to very large endpoints through very small pipes.

121
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,193
Scott: Yeah, now the thing is though.

122
00:08:34,395 --> 00:08:51,075
Scott: even though it is true that a very well properly executed DDoS is indistinguishable from popularity The reality I think is that most DDoS is are not very well done And if you actually spend some time and closely inspect them you know like you look at the packet You know below just the destination.

123
00:08:51,096 --> 00:08:54,186
Scott: You know that the head on deep packet inspection is incredibly costly.

124
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:55,249
Scott: It is incredibly costly.

125
00:08:55,289 --> 00:09:03,250
Scott: however Even like I'm not talking about actual deep packet inspection by the server I'm talking about by a human being just look at it in your you know your Wireshark or whatever.

126
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:10,090
Rym: That's the thing is that the amount of time that adds to your response Basically makes you already a non actor in the situation.

127
00:09:11,952 --> 00:09:15,963
Scott: I mean you could look and you can see aha everything this DDoS is sending out.

128
00:09:16,003 --> 00:09:22,424
Scott: the packets all look exactly like this right and These normal people sending out packets look you know different.

129
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:25,516
Rym: so even most often That's not the case because what are they sending?

130
00:09:25,597 --> 00:09:31,261
Rym: a get well you know who knows what they could be sending plus I mean even on like a local level.

131
00:09:31,281 --> 00:09:35,700
Rym: I mean within a corporate internet or something Let's say like someone's using up all your internet.

132
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,270
Rym: It's not that trivial to figure out right away.

133
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:42,230
Rym: I mean you might have some sort of proxy that logs stuff, but that gives you a huge performance hit.

134
00:09:42,654 --> 00:09:43,017
Rym: So what?

135
00:09:43,058 --> 00:09:44,310
Rym: maybe you turn on IP accounting?

136
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:48,169
Rym: That's also a huge performance hit just to see who's talking the most and then figuring out what's going on.

137
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,636
Scott: Yeah, you could also just sort of have.

138
00:09:49,676 --> 00:09:51,323
Scott: you know just generic throttling.

139
00:09:51,344 --> 00:09:52,810
Scott: you know slow it down.

140
00:09:52,911 --> 00:09:54,624
Scott: So it doesn't kill you, but still let it go.

141
00:09:54,645 --> 00:09:55,128
Rym: slow it down.

142
00:09:55,149 --> 00:09:55,812
Rym: slow What down.

143
00:09:55,832 --> 00:09:58,123
Rym: and does slowing down mean queuing up pack?

144
00:09:58,183 --> 00:09:59,750
Rym: that means it means a QoS type?

145
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:03,722
Rym: Yes, QoS Scott basically means drop packets randomly.

146
00:10:03,902 --> 00:10:06,229
Rym: Yeah, that doesn't often doesn't end.

147
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:08,360
Scott: well Yeah, be good like QoS.

148
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,586
Scott: Just the 4chan packets.

149
00:10:09,606 --> 00:10:11,936
Scott: You know something like that Yeah, but even then that's not so easy.

150
00:10:12,157 --> 00:10:15,870
Rym: and when you're an ISP 4chan is no less legitimate.

151
00:10:16,091 --> 00:10:18,847
Rym: Then I don't know my porn dot org net.

152
00:10:19,109 --> 00:10:23,886
Scott: yeah But if I was an ISP I would definitely have advanced tools and people to deal with that.

153
00:10:23,906 --> 00:10:24,890
Rym: what advanced tools though?

154
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,861
Rym: There's nothing terribly good for that.

155
00:10:26,941 --> 00:10:36,719
Rym: and my giant brain I mean it basically comes down to these kind of fuzzy statistical analysis and no matter what you do You're gonna piss someone off and as attacks to get more sophisticated.

156
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,350
Rym: There's absolutely no way to determine a DDoS versus legitimate use.

157
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:43,981
Scott: Yep, at the very least you know that this you know the.

158
00:10:44,141 --> 00:10:47,111
Scott: you could do like you could like call 4chan and like talk to Him.

159
00:10:47,211 --> 00:10:58,470
Scott: you know like if I saw DDoS going at someone's server, and I was an ISP Regardless of how I dealt with it on my network You know whatever decision I made I would call the person with the server and notify them.

160
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:02,335
Scott: I'd be like you know if I notice it was yours like Google I would call Google on the phone.

161
00:11:02,355 --> 00:11:03,099
Scott: be like hey Google.

162
00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:04,665
Scott: Yeah, this is ISP number three.

163
00:11:04,686 --> 00:11:05,308
Scott: all right point.

164
00:11:05,328 --> 00:11:07,267
Rym: the first point to the first Scott.

165
00:11:08,152 --> 00:11:10,962
Rym: Have you ever tried calling someone based on like some company?

166
00:11:11,023 --> 00:11:12,066
Rym: you know there should be no.

167
00:11:12,147 --> 00:11:13,030
Rym: try calling Google.

168
00:11:13,091 --> 00:11:14,446
Rym: There's no red phone.

169
00:11:15,492 --> 00:11:19,224
Scott: There should be you know a place to call for that specific problem.

170
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:21,010
Rym: It's per service all right Google.

171
00:11:21,091 --> 00:11:23,130
Rym: Maybe Google has a red phone one.

172
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,869
Rym: Yeah, how many people are gonna be calling that for BS?

173
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,234
Scott: I know, but I think you know.

174
00:11:26,254 --> 00:11:28,021
Scott: the fact is everyone has sort of like.

175
00:11:28,061 --> 00:11:32,210
Scott: there is sort of like these standards a little bit Right and that you're supposed to have like an email address.

176
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,381
Scott: That's like abuse at and another one you know.

177
00:11:34,723 --> 00:11:35,749
Scott: so I think we need Scott.

178
00:11:36,051 --> 00:11:36,590
Rym: Here's the problem.

179
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:45,549
Rym: They're sort of standard for I don't think we can because the signal-to-noise ratio is so high already That if you have a standard people will just hit it with their BS all the time.

180
00:11:46,051 --> 00:11:47,055
Scott: No, we just need a standard.

181
00:11:47,115 --> 00:11:52,957
Scott: you know in between network people's not for normal people's just for network people's to You know contact each other all right.

182
00:11:52,977 --> 00:11:55,405
Rym: so the Internet, so who would AT&T have contacted?

183
00:11:55,425 --> 00:11:56,850
Rym: because it's not another network?

184
00:11:56,971 --> 00:11:59,284
Rym: I mean, I guess they could contact what the ISP.

185
00:11:59,325 --> 00:12:00,129
Scott: Google is a network.

186
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,661
Scott: All right, I guess they would probably call someone at Akamai.

187
00:12:02,782 --> 00:12:07,890
Rym: actually because Google's all Akamai Yes, so then what they have so much to deal with anyway, or what about this 4chan situation?

188
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:08,833
Rym: Who do you call?

189
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,104
Rym: the ISP that hosts them.

190
00:12:11,124 --> 00:12:12,270
Rym: you got to figure out who that is?

191
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:13,896
Scott: Yeah, you probably just call their hosting company.

192
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:14,579
Rym: all right.

193
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,745
Rym: You got to figure out who that is.

194
00:12:15,785 --> 00:12:16,910
Rym: you called their generic number.

195
00:12:17,274 --> 00:12:18,225
Rym: It's like an 800 number.

196
00:12:18,266 --> 00:12:18,549
Rym: now what?

197
00:12:19,391 --> 00:12:23,149
Scott: Well they should have a number for calling with network problems with the network people all right.

198
00:12:23,169 --> 00:12:25,309
Rym: now Now they have to staff that number with humans.

199
00:12:25,731 --> 00:12:28,140
Scott: Yeah, it's it's you know in the Network Operations Center.

200
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,786
Scott: where then they already have for telephone?

201
00:12:29,927 --> 00:12:30,870
Rym: is that cost money?

202
00:12:30,932 --> 00:12:31,670
Rym: It costs a lot of money.

203
00:12:31,691 --> 00:12:32,204
Rym: They have to pass.

204
00:12:32,245 --> 00:12:35,850
Scott: yeah But everyone it'll be an equal cost for everyone because everyone will have you know the phone.

205
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:36,735
Rym: It's got that reason.

206
00:12:36,775 --> 00:12:38,082
Rym: that raises the cost of everyone.

207
00:12:38,123 --> 00:12:42,300
Rym: so then I offer an eye But it'll make everything better for everyone also because it's got.

208
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:43,806
Rym: it's the tragedy of the comments.

209
00:12:43,946 --> 00:12:46,335
Rym: everyone offers it great I make an ISP.

210
00:12:46,737 --> 00:12:47,620
Rym: I don't offer it.

211
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:53,089
Scott: I'm now cheaper than everyone else and therefore better And make it a require you should regulate it.

212
00:12:53,451 --> 00:12:59,207
Rym: Oh wait regulation now that opens a whole extra can of worms in favor of that one regulation that it's got.

213
00:12:59,228 --> 00:13:00,050
Rym: so what I mean?

214
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,014
Rym: Where do you draw the line?

215
00:13:01,054 --> 00:13:03,886
Rym: I mean, what if the problem is coming from 4chan itself?

216
00:13:03,966 --> 00:13:04,810
Rym: whose responsibility?

217
00:13:05,192 --> 00:13:06,559
Rym: Is it to cut off that server.

218
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,590
Scott: whoever owns a server all right?

219
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,497
Rym: So how do I determine?

220
00:13:09,698 --> 00:13:11,130
Rym: so anyone who owns a server?

221
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:17,803
Rym: That is in any way on the internet in any capacity has to pay to have a 24 by 7 hotline For people to call.

222
00:13:17,843 --> 00:13:18,429
Rym: that is public.

223
00:13:19,191 --> 00:13:21,118
Rym: Yeah, so we've got to have a hotline.

224
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:24,050
Scott: someone can call your cell phone line out owns our our server.

225
00:13:24,231 --> 00:13:25,878
Scott: We don't own it line ode.

226
00:13:25,918 --> 00:13:27,405
Rym: so the colo company has to do it.

227
00:13:27,626 --> 00:13:29,254
Scott: They're not a colo company They're hosting company.

228
00:13:29,535 --> 00:13:30,861
Rym: alright, so hosting companies.

229
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,850
Rym: Yeah, what defines hosting company?

230
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:37,010
Rym: I mean I can have a web server through our dynamic DNS out to the internet.

231
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,502
Rym: Yeah, so now do I have to do this?

232
00:13:39,562 --> 00:13:39,843
Rym: How do I?

233
00:13:40,065 --> 00:13:40,869
Rym: how do I regulate that?

234
00:13:41,931 --> 00:13:44,158
Scott: If there's a problem and someone looks up your phone number.

235
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:47,630
Scott: They can't find you then you know you gotta maintain this look-up.

236
00:13:47,871 --> 00:13:48,835
Scott: It's in who is put in.

237
00:13:48,855 --> 00:13:51,626
Scott: the who is do where the abuse and all the other email addresses are the thing.

238
00:13:51,646 --> 00:13:54,336
Rym: that's basically completely Useless and unreliable as it stands.

239
00:13:54,356 --> 00:13:54,979
Scott: I think the who is.

240
00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:55,360
Scott: I should.

241
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,950
Scott: I think the I can should be more better about enforcing.

242
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:00,480
Scott: Who's gonna pay for that who were already paying for the.

243
00:14:00,561 --> 00:14:01,786
Scott: I can might as well pay more.

244
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:02,850
Scott: it sucks as it is.

245
00:14:03,011 --> 00:14:04,538
Rym: I don't think regulation is the answer.

246
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:07,230
Scott: I think I think there's a small amount of regulation would be good.

247
00:14:08,191 --> 00:14:14,510
Scott: People on the Internet's major network players need to have some way of just communicating with each other when shit goes down.

248
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:18,910
Rym: Yes, and defining who a major network player is is already effectively impossible.

249
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:20,276
Rym: There's a lot of obvious.

250
00:14:20,356 --> 00:14:26,822
Rym: look at how many times even at the high level where the to to like level two ISPs will stop pairing with each other over some bullshit.

251
00:14:27,022 --> 00:14:27,263
Scott: Yep.

252
00:14:27,725 --> 00:14:29,150
Rym: How are you going to regulate that?

253
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:32,265
Rym: What if they just hang up on you, and then they say yeah the phone didn't work?

254
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:33,009
Rym: or what if they just?

255
00:14:33,794 --> 00:14:34,862
Rym: They say you know all right.

256
00:14:35,225 --> 00:14:35,850
Rym: Here's the situation.

257
00:14:36,211 --> 00:14:41,710
Rym: Let's say I as like you know a company call level three or cogent or someone because I have a problem.

258
00:14:42,032 --> 00:14:44,149
Rym: I'm singing DDoS and it's coming from their network.

259
00:14:44,974 --> 00:14:51,290
Rym: You know how long it's going to take me to get through Them to show them what the problem is such that they can deal with it.

260
00:14:51,531 --> 00:14:57,130
Rym: It is much faster for me to simply block it thus saving myself the problem and by acting in my own self-interest.

261
00:14:57,612 --> 00:15:00,970
Rym: It is not in my interest to work with anyone in any good faith.

262
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:03,058
Rym: It is in my interest to cut them the fuck off.

263
00:15:03,579 --> 00:15:05,968
Scott: Yeah, but blocking is it's.

264
00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:08,670
Scott: you know It's bad for all sorts of other reasons is it?

265
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:23,609
Rym: But what if you identified something that is coming through your network that is substantially degrading the entirety of your network And you have reason to believe may be substantially degrading the behavior of other people's networks And you have the capability right now to temporarily stop it and sort it out?

266
00:15:24,172 --> 00:15:27,749
Scott: Yeah, but what if you were wrong and it was actually people searching for Michael Jackson after he died?

267
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:30,399
Rym: well Here's the other problem, you know, there's the whole simulac.

268
00:15:30,439 --> 00:15:31,884
Scott: I think it's better safe than sorry.

269
00:15:31,944 --> 00:15:33,670
Rym: No safe than sorry in what direction?

270
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,336
Rym: Here's the other simulac or situation.

271
00:15:35,878 --> 00:15:48,030
Rym: if you cannot tell the difference between legitimate traffic and a DDoS They are effectively the same thing and blocking them has the same effect because legitimate traffic and illegitimate traffic are basically indistinguishable.

272
00:15:49,211 --> 00:15:54,189
Rym: So the Michael Jackson searches are equally useless and causing an equal problem to the 4chan DDoS.

273
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:58,290
Scott: Well, one of them is censorship and one of them is you know protection.

274
00:15:58,972 --> 00:16:04,467
Rym: But is it censorship to block something that is basically preventing your network from functioning properly?

275
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:11,950
Scott: if your network isn't Functioning when there is legitimate activity occurring then your network is just not capable of doing what needs to do.

276
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:12,251
Rym: It's got.

277
00:16:12,311 --> 00:16:20,809
Rym: no network is capable because we've gotten to the point to where there is more data people want to send than there will Ever be capacity and the fundamental problem is exposed.

278
00:16:21,091 --> 00:16:30,709
Rym: Well, the fundamental problem is that there's no way to distinguish there's no regulatory way to solve it And currently there's no technological way to solve it other than being very very very very very smart.

279
00:16:31,452 --> 00:16:37,170
Scott: Well, you know the thing is despite all those things you just said there aren't DDoS is just going around killing everyone.

280
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,779
Scott: Everything's got to work still.

281
00:16:38,981 --> 00:16:40,309
Rym: part of that is because people are.

282
00:16:40,831 --> 00:16:44,104
Rym: Networks are actually fairly proactive and stopping these sorts of things.

283
00:16:44,485 --> 00:16:44,746
Scott: Yeah.

284
00:16:45,549 --> 00:16:52,236
Scott: Oh Let us let us continue to another news and let us hope that the 4chan people You know don't ruin the Internet's.

285
00:16:52,998 --> 00:16:54,041
Rym: so remember a while ago.

286
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:56,989
Rym: There was that whole brouhaha where oh shit, huh?

287
00:16:58,013 --> 00:17:02,650
Rym: Yes They deleted all these books from people's Kindles remotely.

288
00:17:02,991 --> 00:17:07,527
Rym: Oh, you want to talk about this BS like George Arwell's 1984 over the horror the irony.

289
00:17:08,411 --> 00:17:11,790
Scott: I think it would have been more ironic though if they deleted Fahrenheit 451.

290
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:15,262
Rym: I believe someone reported that they also deleted that.

291
00:17:15,463 --> 00:17:16,507
Scott: that was just some.

292
00:17:16,547 --> 00:17:17,430
Scott: probably gotta be a joke.

293
00:17:17,671 --> 00:17:21,026
Scott: Well, the whole situation is that would have been the headline over the 1984 headline.

294
00:17:22,132 --> 00:17:30,970
Rym: Well, here's the deal as far as I can tell basically One people are angry about the fact that they have the ability to delete content that you bought.

295
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:31,653
Rym: This is kind of.

296
00:17:32,196 --> 00:17:35,170
Rym: this is the thing that people who are advocating their own has it?

297
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:40,767
Rym: This is the thing people were advocating DRM said would never happen.

298
00:17:40,847 --> 00:17:41,409
Rym: and here it is.

299
00:17:42,412 --> 00:17:44,539
Rym: This is like the like the most egregious.

300
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,324
Rym: here it is you bought something.

301
00:17:46,385 --> 00:17:57,509
Rym: they just delete it with a big fuck you Mm-hmm, but it's a little more complicated than that because what they deleted was 1984 which was being sold through their store by someone who had no legal right to sell it.

302
00:17:58,152 --> 00:18:03,510
Scott: Well, actually it's kind of weird because that book is in the public domain elsewhere in the world But it's not in the public domain in the US.

303
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:08,390
Rym: Well, thus the other problem of the public domain and we've talked a lot about this in our forum.

304
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:12,130
Rym: We haven't really brought it up in the show, but I'm pretty sure we have not in any great detail.

305
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:26,029
Rym: We're getting to this point to where I feel like the public domain as an institution is Almost over broad and inconsistent and I feel like usually I am of the mind that we need to reduce Creators rights in order for the public good.

306
00:18:26,775 --> 00:18:32,848
Rym: This is one situation where I feel like we need to increase Creators rights and I think the public domain really needs to be replaced by some sort of you.

307
00:18:33,873 --> 00:18:39,040
Rym: I think an artist has a perpetual right to Notability and a perpetual right to attribution.

308
00:18:39,542 --> 00:18:41,650
Scott: Well, no one's come no one's complaining about attribution.

309
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:45,346
Scott: People are complaining about you know, the ability to just use the frickin.

310
00:18:45,386 --> 00:18:53,615
Scott: Yes, but the fact that the Okay, they don't want to change the name on the book to say 1984 by Scott Reuben They just read it they can.

311
00:18:53,655 --> 00:19:04,890
Rym: but the problem is that the public domain is both over broad in one way and yet So far out into the future and so inconsistent that it's useless anyway.

312
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,475
Rym: So the whole thing's moot to begin with.

313
00:19:06,776 --> 00:19:09,565
Scott: yeah, well, I think one interesting thing about the situation right?

314
00:19:09,646 --> 00:19:12,566
Scott: is we usually you know We talk about you know.

315
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:17,804
Scott: Aha, well, you know a regular book, you know, just you know photo.

316
00:19:17,885 --> 00:19:20,674
Scott: if I steal a regular book from you now You don't have the book right?

317
00:19:20,694 --> 00:19:24,750
Scott: We're always comparing the digital reality to the physical, you know manufactured reality.

318
00:19:24,971 --> 00:19:26,196
Rym: But then there's the meta argument.

319
00:19:26,217 --> 00:19:29,250
Scott: The thing is right with the physical book, right?

320
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:38,230
Scott: Let's say I illegally printed up copies of 1984 and sold one to you Right, and then I go to jail or I get sued or whatever happens to me for my illegal, right?

321
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,949
Scott: They're never gonna come and take the book away.

322
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:45,330
Rym: Well you and they perfectly legally can because the receipt of stolen property is itself something that can be remedied.

323
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:49,310
Rym: So if you get stolen property, the police can just take it from you with no compensation.

324
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:50,154
Scott: They never will.

325
00:19:50,175 --> 00:19:52,929
Scott: they're gonna have that book, you know, how many you get bootleg CD?

326
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:54,454
Scott: They're not gonna come and get it.

327
00:19:54,554 --> 00:19:55,298
Rym: is they can.

328
00:19:55,318 --> 00:19:58,859
Rym: and in a lot of cases like if you buy a car and it turns Out the car was stolen.

329
00:19:58,879 --> 00:20:11,010
Rym: You're just out of luck Uh-huh, so then if that is the person who sold it to you, but they're probably in jail and indigent at this point Anyway, so if that's the case, right the you know, the the stolen property, right?

330
00:20:11,491 --> 00:20:18,684
Scott: Then this is a situation where if you want to if you want to talk about it that way Then these people got off easy by getting a refund and having the book taken away.

331
00:20:18,745 --> 00:20:19,246
Rym: Here's the thing.

332
00:20:19,266 --> 00:20:24,580
Rym: I Have my take is that they were technically in the right.

333
00:20:25,022 --> 00:20:32,163
Rym: They were technically correct the best kind of correct, but There was probably a better way to go about it.

334
00:20:32,363 --> 00:20:35,647
Rym: that wouldn't have generated all this bad Press and would have made everyone happier.

335
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:41,359
Scott: Yeah well, I mean they were first of all, they were negligent in making sure that people who selling books on the Kindle had the right to it right.

336
00:20:42,147 --> 00:20:51,817
Scott: and Second of all, right now this is what happens when you have a closed platform Right is you look at something like, you know The Kindle or the Apple Store right?

337
00:20:52,239 --> 00:20:55,350
Scott: if you actually want to have some sort of control over what?

338
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:58,721
Scott: Content shows up in your you know, what books are on Kindle.

339
00:20:59,102 --> 00:21:01,610
Scott: then you're now responsible for a books are on Kindle.

340
00:21:01,731 --> 00:21:04,230
Scott: Amazon was responsible for that book being there.

341
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,414
Scott: That wasn't supposed to be there.

342
00:21:05,976 --> 00:21:19,430
Scott: if they would just be cool and let anyone put whatever the fuck book they want on the Kindle Right without interfering or anything then Amazon would have no responsibility And it would be up to that person who illegally put the book there to go get in trouble.

343
00:21:19,651 --> 00:21:24,170
Rym: Well, that is I would still have responsibility if someone bamboozled them and sold something through their store.

344
00:21:24,812 --> 00:21:35,529
Scott: But yes, but no it's not Amazon's responsive if Amazon just let anyone put any book on the Kindle right without You know making a yes or no decision then Amazon's got nothing to do with it.

345
00:21:36,355 --> 00:21:36,998
Rym: No, because what if?

346
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:37,179
Rym: what?

347
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:42,029
Rym: if they set up for Amazon, you know You can put whatever book you want on the Kindle trivially and it'll just work.

348
00:21:42,451 --> 00:21:46,589
Rym: But they also have their store which you pay for them to get a book from it.

349
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:50,809
Scott: No No, I'm talking about there's a store and anyone can put anything in the store and that's it.

350
00:21:51,452 --> 00:21:52,155
Scott: I'm talking about that.

351
00:21:52,215 --> 00:21:55,630
Rym: you still run into legal trouble in that situation by facilitating the sale.

352
00:21:56,031 --> 00:21:57,756
Scott: No, cuz that's what the DMCA does.

353
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:04,201
Scott: the DMCA says if you're making a platform for distribution and you're not, you know Controlling it editorially got the damage.

354
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:10,566
Rym: You're not responsible for you know To a degree as far as I've read the DMCA only protects you in certain specific situations.

355
00:22:10,586 --> 00:22:11,790
Rym: You're still confronted to trouble.

356
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:12,112
Rym: I think.

357
00:22:12,293 --> 00:22:13,237
Scott: no actually that's.

358
00:22:13,418 --> 00:22:14,825
Scott: it's a specific thing.

359
00:22:14,886 --> 00:22:15,690
Scott: is that it's that you know.

360
00:22:16,511 --> 00:22:21,250
Rym: Situation where the law encourages something that in the end is actually in more bad faith toward the authors.

361
00:22:21,651 --> 00:22:25,429
Scott: Yeah, but no that's you know, why Google was so genius with YouTube, right?

362
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:27,419
Scott: Google doesn't say this can go on YouTube.

363
00:22:27,459 --> 00:22:29,290
Scott: this can unless it's you know illegal child.

364
00:22:29,993 --> 00:22:31,661
Rym: Notice how they still have to take things down.

365
00:22:31,802 --> 00:22:33,550
Scott: Oh, they don't take it down, right?

366
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:34,913
Scott: Google doesn't take it down.

367
00:22:34,993 --> 00:22:44,275
Rym: the copyright holders are doing the police copyright order holder does all the policing but once the copyright holder makes A legitimate request Google has to follow her and take it down Doesn't take it down?

368
00:22:44,295 --> 00:22:47,550
Scott: the copyright holders have an interface through which they do the taking down.

369
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,880
Rym: Yes, but Google created that to comply with the law.

370
00:22:50,181 --> 00:22:52,110
Scott: No, they didn't do to complain with the law.

371
00:22:52,210 --> 00:23:01,396
Rym: They did it to you know, keep those copyright holders from you know Bitching and mode Oh Scott because if Google had not created that interface for them to do it directly Then Google would have had to do it.

372
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,967
Rym: No, they wouldn't have in response to a complaint.

373
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:06,130
Scott: They would have No in respite.

374
00:23:06,293 --> 00:23:07,993
Scott: Oh if they yeah then the DMCA.

375
00:23:08,033 --> 00:23:10,763
Rym: if someone makes a complaint to them then they would have to respond.

376
00:23:10,824 --> 00:23:15,240
Rym: their genius was making a system to where They don't have to actually ever Themselves deal with the complaints.

377
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,410
Rym: the complaints are dealt with directly.

378
00:23:17,032 --> 00:23:21,910
Scott: Yeah, the thing is you don't have to you know respond to the complaints unless someone actually comes and you know sues you or whatever.

379
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:27,909
Rym: Well, no if someone responds the safe harbor thing is basically that if someone makes a complaint then you have.

380
00:23:27,949 --> 00:23:29,129
Rym: you know You have to take it down.

381
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:32,582
Scott: You don't have to take it down until they you know prove just making it take.

382
00:23:32,622 --> 00:23:35,010
Scott: sending a takedown notice isn't enough unless you know.

383
00:23:35,191 --> 00:23:37,218
Scott: That's basically the nice thing you can do.

384
00:23:37,338 --> 00:23:38,724
Scott: is you know, take it down.

385
00:23:38,804 --> 00:23:41,454
Scott: if you know someone sends you a takedown notice They still have to go to.

386
00:23:41,515 --> 00:23:44,990
Scott: you know, if you say no, they have to go to court and prove that they actually own it.

387
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,693
Rym: Well, here's the thing you don't want.

388
00:23:46,773 --> 00:23:58,646
Rym: as far as I'm aware and I'm pretty sure I'm more right on this than you if someone issues you a takedown out of the DMCA and You don't there's certain things you have to do in good faith or else you lose the safe harbor provision.

389
00:23:58,907 --> 00:23:59,670
Scott: No, I'm pretty.

390
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:09,290
Scott: no They have to go You know, you can just be like whatever and completely ignore it and they have to go and prove that they actually own it You know to make you take it down, but the takedown notice just sort of an a nice thing.

391
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:12,210
Scott: It's like hey before you know, we go to court.

392
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:18,636
Scott: Yeah I just want to let you know and if you're pretty sure that you know you they own it and you don't want to deal With that bullshit, then you take it down.

393
00:24:19,078 --> 00:24:21,347
Rym: So 30 seconds of googling proves that I'm right.

394
00:24:21,588 --> 00:24:23,293
Scott: No, it doesn't Doesn't?

395
00:24:23,374 --> 00:24:23,636
Rym: alright?

396
00:24:24,281 --> 00:24:43,374
Rym: in order to have an allegedly Infringing website removed from a service providers network or to have access to an allegedly infringing website Disabled the copyright owner must provide and then they give this list of things you have to provide Which is you know the name and address of the complaint the material in question a statement under penalty of perjury that you're accurate in Your claim and all that stuff.

397
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:53,490
Rym: now once notice is given to a service provider or the service provider discovers them infringing material itself They are required to expeditiously remove or disable access to the material.

398
00:24:54,296 --> 00:24:56,190
Scott: Yeah, but the point is is that you you know.

399
00:24:56,311 --> 00:25:02,285
Scott: The original point was that if you you know If you are not editing your content, even just letting people post whatever they want.

400
00:25:02,686 --> 00:25:04,235
Scott: You have a safe harbor Still says that.

401
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:11,090
Rym: and remember It gets tricky when their commercial interests involved, especially if you facilitate the transaction.

402
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:18,760
Rym: But when it comes to the safe harbor specifically if you're given a takedown notice, you have to take it down Immediately and then the person that's.

403
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:21,252
Scott: if the takedown notice is legitimate what it you know It says.

404
00:25:21,855 --> 00:25:27,161
Scott: if they have to you know say that they're definitely the people who oh, yes It's not difficult to make a legitimate one.

405
00:25:27,181 --> 00:25:28,447
Rym: There are very few criteria.

406
00:25:28,467 --> 00:25:28,929
Rym: You have to meet.

407
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:33,710
Scott: Yeah, but you know there's plenty you know, well I could just make up takedown notices for nothing and send them in.

408
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:35,457
Rym: Yes, you can and if you do you know what.

409
00:25:35,497 --> 00:25:38,490
Rym: the people you send them to have to take the stuff down at first.

410
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:40,040
Scott: But what am I sending stuff for?

411
00:25:40,061 --> 00:25:41,289
Scott: like someone else's shit, you know?

412
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:50,675
Rym: However, you doing that is illegal and then the person who stuff was taken down can file a counterclaim and then they could basically sue You for perjury, but it's basically more.

413
00:25:50,775 --> 00:25:51,738
Scott: it's basically they've made.

414
00:25:51,778 --> 00:25:55,950
Scott: it's a situation where it's less work to just take all the shit down.

415
00:25:57,052 --> 00:25:58,070
Rym: It's not just less work.

416
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:04,605
Rym: It's that if if the ISP the person who is providing the place where the stuff is Does not immediately respond and take it down.

417
00:26:04,926 --> 00:26:12,409
Rym: They're responsible So they'll just take it down no matter what and then it is your responsibility As the person who put the stuff up in the first place to file a counterclaim and get it back.

418
00:26:12,952 --> 00:26:21,950
Scott: The point is that if they just let anyone who wanted to post books to Amazon They would still have to take down things based on infringement notices immediately.

419
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:26,931
Scott: Perhaps they would have to take it down, but there is nothing in there that says they would have to remove it from all the Kindles.

420
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:31,784
Rym: Well, the thing is that I could see situation because remember safe harbor.

421
00:26:31,944 --> 00:26:38,550
Rym: All it does is protect you from being sued Mm-hmm, but you still at the same time distributed what could be classified as stolen materials.

422
00:26:39,212 --> 00:26:39,976
Scott: I didn't distribute it.

423
00:26:39,996 --> 00:26:43,510
Scott: the responsibility for that distribution goes to the person who posted it.

424
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:49,510
Rym: I said me but I'm safe only if you don't have the means to remove it Because if you do have the means then you're not safe.

425
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:52,000
Rym: Harbor doesn't give you protection from that sort of thing or from remedies.

426
00:26:52,441 --> 00:26:54,610
Rym: It only protects you from monetary damages.

427
00:26:55,751 --> 00:26:56,994
Scott: Yeah, you can't sue me.

428
00:26:57,195 --> 00:27:01,669
Scott: someone else puts that you know copyright infringing video on YouTube and then it was taken down.

429
00:27:01,709 --> 00:27:09,447
Scott: and now Um, you know, even though someone out there might have downloaded that video from YouTube and saved it and kept it around We don't make them from their computer.

430
00:27:09,468 --> 00:27:14,369
Rym: right now I can show in a court of law that you have the ability to trivially remove it from everyone's computers who download.

431
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:15,495
Scott: well See that see that's the thing is.

432
00:27:15,535 --> 00:27:30,522
Scott: I think it was a big mistake was even putting that ability in in the first place By using the same DRM, right that you were attempting to use to you know, prevent copy protection You know to prevent, you know copyright infringing activities.

433
00:27:30,844 --> 00:27:32,629
Scott: You've actually sort of screwed yourself.

434
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:41,226
Rym: well Scott is it's a cash 22 because I have a feeling that very few publishers would have agreed to even be on the Kindle in The first place or through their store at all if they didn't have this ability.

435
00:27:41,287 --> 00:27:42,191
Rym: and this DRM It's.

436
00:27:42,211 --> 00:27:43,515
Scott: so I can't believe it's.

437
00:27:43,535 --> 00:27:45,420
Scott: it's one thing that astonishes me right?

438
00:27:45,481 --> 00:27:48,650
Scott: is that you think about this right copyright copyright copy.

439
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:52,344
Scott: We've been talking about this for how long over a decade.

440
00:27:52,364 --> 00:27:52,906
Scott: It's the year 2009 Scott.

441
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:56,827
Scott: This is an issue since the late 90s.

442
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,321
Scott: I know where you're going.

443
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:00,616
Rym: there's a trivial answers to why one.

444
00:28:00,998 --> 00:28:03,227
Rym: the majority of the population of the world doesn't care.

445
00:28:03,247 --> 00:28:08,330
Rym: a very small subset of people even know it's an issue and That's it No one cares.

446
00:28:08,391 --> 00:28:09,165
Rym: so it'll never get changed.

447
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:18,659
Scott: and Even after over a decade the record companies have figured out that DRM is completely stupid and their sales Really haven't gone down since getting rid of DRM.

448
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,630
Scott: and in fact recently an RA person was like DRM is dead.

449
00:28:22,011 --> 00:28:24,942
Scott: Hello, welcome to you know, 2009.

450
00:28:24,942 --> 00:28:25,905
Scott: It's like I'm like hello.

451
00:28:25,966 --> 00:28:27,891
Scott: Welcome to 1999.

452
00:28:27,891 --> 00:28:37,664
Scott: Yet the people with books the people with movies They still haven't learned the same exact lesson in over a decade because I'm pretty much like well If you're that slow to learn your lesson just fuck you.

453
00:28:37,704 --> 00:28:38,469
Scott: I'm just gonna steal all your.

454
00:28:38,489 --> 00:28:39,295
Rym: well No, it's got part of it.

455
00:28:39,315 --> 00:28:41,210
Rym: I think is that with music they were basically damned.

456
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:45,650
Rym: They didn't end if they didn't so they went with the damned if they didn't but I don't think they're really any better off.

457
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:48,830
Rym: Either way, and when it comes to everything else, there's no incentive.

458
00:28:49,011 --> 00:28:53,050
Rym: There's absolutely no incentive to drop it because it's one of those tragedy of the common situations.

459
00:28:54,134 --> 00:28:57,909
Rym: If one person drops it Then all the publishers will go to the people who still have it.

460
00:28:58,291 --> 00:29:03,290
Rym: Everyone has to drop it at the same time or the people who drop it lose out from the publishers and the publishers don't care.

461
00:29:03,691 --> 00:29:04,594
Rym: And the people don't care.

462
00:29:04,615 --> 00:29:05,277
Rym: so nothing changes.

463
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:09,070
Scott: I think I think the thing is they underestimate how much the people do care.

464
00:29:09,311 --> 00:29:11,258
Rym: And no, I think it's an echo chamber.

465
00:29:11,318 --> 00:29:11,881
Rym: nerds care.

466
00:29:11,921 --> 00:29:12,563
Rym: No one else does.

467
00:29:12,985 --> 00:29:15,074
Rym: no one else even realizes There's a problem.

468
00:29:15,095 --> 00:29:28,123
Scott: well see that's the thing is I think people don't realize there's a problem But then as soon as until it gets in their face people don't realize didn't realize iTunes DRM was a problem until they tried to You know authorize that fifth computer, or you know they.

469
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:29,670
Scott: they tried to redownload something.

470
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,317
Scott: They got deleted when their hard drive crashed.

471
00:29:31,337 --> 00:29:34,150
Scott: people don't realize the Kindle DRM is even there at all.

472
00:29:34,331 --> 00:29:37,390
Scott: It's not an issue to them until the book they paid for gets deleted.

473
00:29:37,632 --> 00:29:39,628
Scott: Then suddenly they wake up to DRM.

474
00:29:39,991 --> 00:29:43,407
Scott: And I think over time more and more people wake up to DRM.

475
00:29:43,487 --> 00:29:48,830
Scott: and in each Individual arena in music it already enough people woke up in music to get rid of it.

476
00:29:48,991 --> 00:29:54,270
Scott: I think it's only a matter of time before Enough people wake up to it in movies and wake up to it in ebooks.

477
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:57,286
Scott: And now you have to get rid of it too, and it's just you know.

478
00:29:57,326 --> 00:29:58,010
Scott: you wait for these people.

479
00:29:59,291 --> 00:30:01,781
Rym: It's a matter of time, but the fact is that right now.

480
00:30:01,842 --> 00:30:02,826
Rym: We're nowhere near that.

481
00:30:02,866 --> 00:30:03,850
Rym: so nothing's going to change.

482
00:30:04,437 --> 00:30:05,409
Scott: I think it's gonna change.

483
00:30:05,672 --> 00:30:08,048
Rym: I don't think it is because one how few people own kindles.

484
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:09,537
Rym: anyway It's a relatively small.

485
00:30:09,618 --> 00:30:20,928
Scott: and the other thing that there's so retard is that look Anyone who's gonna buy books is gonna You know for you there kindle is gonna buy them whether this DRM or not and anyone who's gonna Pirate them is gonna pirate them whether this DRM or not.

486
00:30:21,411 --> 00:30:28,070
Rym: It's just no because there isn't as nearly as wide of a piracy network for books because only nerds care.

487
00:30:28,211 --> 00:30:29,516
Rym: No one else does think about it.

488
00:30:29,576 --> 00:30:34,194
Rym: most people don't even like things like kindles because they have the stigma against reading things on a Piece of paper.

489
00:30:34,435 --> 00:30:37,770
Scott: yeah, the kindles actually sound really well though, so it is selling really well.

490
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:40,448
Scott: But I do want to point out that they had to drop the price on it.

491
00:30:40,469 --> 00:30:42,210
Scott: perhaps It's not selling as well as they expect.

492
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,775
Rym: It's got wallet selling really well.

493
00:30:43,855 --> 00:30:45,681
Rym: the majority of people don't care.

494
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:47,125
Rym: don't want any device like this.

495
00:30:47,165 --> 00:30:50,638
Scott: story is all over the news so It's already out of the news.

496
00:30:50,879 --> 00:30:51,984
Rym: It's only in the tech news now.

497
00:30:52,025 --> 00:30:53,050
Rym: No one cares anymore.

498
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:54,195
Scott: It was on the regular news.

499
00:30:54,295 --> 00:30:56,263
Rym: yeah for a brief flash and people have already got.

500
00:30:56,303 --> 00:30:58,515
Rym: people care more about New Jersey than they ever Will about this.

501
00:30:58,817 --> 00:31:00,410
Scott: oh, New Jersey, that's something to talk about.

502
00:31:07,044 --> 00:31:08,819
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

503
00:31:09,281 --> 00:31:23,718
Rym: So you know that apocryphal tale about how when NASA was trying to figure out a way that's to write In space on the space shuttle in the Apollo program They came up with a multi-million dollar program to make the space pen and the Russians just use a pencil and how.

504
00:31:23,738 --> 00:31:27,272
Rym: that was completely Apocryphal and not true, but it's a very resonant story.

505
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:28,919
Scott: It is an apocryphal story.

506
00:31:28,979 --> 00:31:31,428
Scott: however I do want to point out this space pen does exist.

507
00:31:31,649 --> 00:31:34,660
Rym: it does, but we did invent that well for that reason.

508
00:31:34,961 --> 00:31:36,366
Rym: But it has its uses.

509
00:31:36,406 --> 00:31:38,634
Rym: I can write upside down continuously great.

510
00:31:39,136 --> 00:31:40,280
Rym: Yeah, it is great.

511
00:31:40,942 --> 00:31:46,624
Rym: Not really that is okay, but anyway here is basically the same story But it's not apocryphal.

512
00:31:46,664 --> 00:31:50,134
Rym: so if you want that sort of story to tell us an anecdote here.

513
00:31:50,175 --> 00:31:51,258
Rym: We go in China.

514
00:31:52,684 --> 00:31:59,753
Rym: There was some regulation saying that buses have to have Devices to allow you to break a window in the event of an emergency and escape.

515
00:32:00,195 --> 00:32:03,939
Rym: and you've seen these things are like a specialized Little hammer with like the pointy bit.

516
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:08,360
Scott: Why don't they just have the removable windows where you like pull the clamp off the side of the window and push it out?

517
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:12,140
Rym: Well one those are a lot more expensive than you know what is on existing buses.

518
00:32:12,361 --> 00:32:14,820
Rym: Yeah, okay, yeah, and to even in the u.s.

519
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,580
Rym: A lot of buses that have those windows also have the hammers somewhere.

520
00:32:17,841 --> 00:32:20,711
Rym: Uh-huh because you know the window might be in the wrong place.

521
00:32:20,752 --> 00:32:22,277
Rym: They can't make all the windows that way.

522
00:32:22,297 --> 00:32:24,847
Rym: yeah Yeah, and also, it's China.

523
00:32:24,867 --> 00:32:25,630
Rym: You know not everybody.

524
00:32:25,651 --> 00:32:27,699
Scott: they have the school bus rear exit action.

525
00:32:28,324 --> 00:32:29,660
Rym: You can but that's not enough.

526
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,684
Scott: I mean US school buses.

527
00:32:30,704 --> 00:32:31,186
Scott: they have the.

528
00:32:31,467 --> 00:32:32,771
Scott: you can push out the window also.

529
00:32:33,012 --> 00:32:40,760
Rym: you basically need the rear exit the side exit the Top exit yep, so they have this regulation to save lives because obviously there's a lot of crappy old buses.

530
00:32:41,061 --> 00:32:42,690
Scott: Oh wait lots of crappy old buzz.

531
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,112
Rym: think about it.

532
00:32:43,172 --> 00:32:48,960
Rym: a simple solution is to Require that all buses have means of egress in the case of an emergency.

533
00:32:49,502 --> 00:32:54,519
Rym: And you could have kind of the last resort regulatory option of the special little hammer to break the window and get out.

534
00:32:55,222 --> 00:32:58,940
Rym: Well it turns out those little hammers are being stolen in every single bus.

535
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,106
Rym: They put him in because you steal a hammer.

536
00:33:01,507 --> 00:33:01,888
Rym: Why not?

537
00:33:01,988 --> 00:33:02,449
Rym: it's there.

538
00:33:02,891 --> 00:33:03,974
Rym: It's trivial to grab.

539
00:33:04,495 --> 00:33:06,300
Rym: It's a relatively useful tool.

540
00:33:06,461 --> 00:33:09,660
Rym: It's basically like this pick and China's relatively poor especially in the more rural.

541
00:33:09,881 --> 00:33:12,400
Scott: Why don't you put the hammer in like you know the little glass case?

542
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,948
Scott: This is breaking case of emergency.

543
00:33:13,968 --> 00:33:16,140
Rym: just break it and take the hammer and also that's more expensive.

544
00:33:16,421 --> 00:33:19,236
Rym: Yeah, and think all right someone breaks it and take the camera.

545
00:33:19,296 --> 00:33:24,119
Rym: great now I have to replace the hammer and the glass but the alarm goes off and you arrest them for stealing.

546
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:25,859
Rym: now I also have to pay for an alarm.

547
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,557
Scott: It's just a little teeny teeny teeny.

548
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:29,483
Rym: Yeah, it's got that.

549
00:33:29,604 --> 00:33:30,971
Rym: that that's a lot said.

550
00:33:31,012 --> 00:33:36,830
Scott: when you multiply it by number Maybe China can buy their own crappy You know bell ringy things instead of selling them to us.

551
00:33:37,111 --> 00:33:39,320
Rym: so it's got multiply that by number of buses in China.

552
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,384
Rym: You have a problem.

553
00:33:40,986 --> 00:33:55,248
Rym: so some enterprising bus companies took bricks painted them yellow put the Chinese characters on them to be you know in case of emergency and These 100% met the regulatory requirement.

554
00:33:55,669 --> 00:33:59,039
Rym: and as the bus company said no one's going to steal a brick.

555
00:33:59,059 --> 00:34:01,326
Scott: I Would it would be cool brick?

556
00:34:01,366 --> 00:34:01,869
Scott: I would take one.

557
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:03,557
Rym: Are you gonna carry this brick around?

558
00:34:03,577 --> 00:34:04,060
Rym: We're gonna do it.

559
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,239
Rym: We stole a brick at RIT.

560
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:05,743
Rym: You know what.

561
00:34:05,984 --> 00:34:06,869
Rym: we put it back.

562
00:34:07,151 --> 00:34:08,800
Rym: that brick was more of a pain in the ass.

563
00:34:09,001 --> 00:34:11,380
Scott: But this brick is yellow and his cool Chinese writing on it.

564
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:18,308
Rym: That would be like a souvenir when I got back to the old Chinese writing in China is the equivalent of stealing a brick that Says like BD on it.

565
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:24,031
Scott: Yeah BD is cool No, but when if I'm not Chinese, I'd steal it.

566
00:34:24,071 --> 00:34:26,500
Scott: Chinese people don't want the bricks, but US people would watch.

567
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:30,152
Rym: Yes, and how many US people are gonna ride some podunk bus in the middle of China?

568
00:34:30,274 --> 00:34:32,020
Scott: I would well why else go to China?

569
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,085
Scott: I want to get the real experience.

570
00:34:35,185 --> 00:34:40,855
Rym: anyway if you want that tail, and you don't want it to be apocryphal here you go And there's a good picture of the brick.

571
00:34:41,058 --> 00:34:42,967
Scott: well You know how you were just talking about.

572
00:34:43,288 --> 00:34:44,592
Scott: you know Russians using a pencil.

573
00:34:44,793 --> 00:34:45,456
Scott: yep, you know.

574
00:34:45,496 --> 00:34:48,335
Scott: and we made a space pen Which isn't true, but anyway right.

575
00:34:48,578 --> 00:34:51,574
Scott: well You know we made you know IBM computers.

576
00:34:51,594 --> 00:34:55,552
Scott: You know Russians made BIM computers, I don't know what they.

577
00:34:55,712 --> 00:34:57,020
Scott: you know they made Russian computers.

578
00:34:57,362 --> 00:35:00,619
Rym: And if you know China tried to make computers to that the dragon project back in the day.

579
00:35:00,901 --> 00:35:01,385
Scott: You know that was.

580
00:35:01,425 --> 00:35:03,380
Scott: that was more recently that was a while ago.

581
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,908
Rym: They tried to make their own chips not X.

582
00:35:05,008 --> 00:35:06,254
Scott: it was less than a decade ago.

583
00:35:06,315 --> 00:35:12,113
Scott: these Russian computers Let's talk decade a decade less than a decade even less than a decade.

584
00:35:12,555 --> 00:35:14,300
Rym: What was the world like in?

585
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,463
Rym: 2002?

586
00:35:16,463 --> 00:35:21,359
Scott: not bad these computers by the Russians are made in the 50s and mostly the 60s.

587
00:35:24,763 --> 00:35:26,511
Scott: I mean you think about it right and it's it.

588
00:35:26,652 --> 00:35:30,630
Scott: there's this whole thing that goes on with Soviet stuff because they were cut off from the world.

589
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,635
Scott: so it's like they didn't have.

590
00:35:31,675 --> 00:35:42,840
Scott: you know it's like you look around the world Today right it's like okay if I go to say Japan or China or Australia or Europe right we generally have a lot of the same stuff.

591
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:45,920
Scott: You know maybe their exact model of DVD player be a little different.

592
00:35:46,342 --> 00:35:49,032
Scott: Maybe there's some you know unique local stylings, but in general.

593
00:35:49,092 --> 00:35:49,373
Scott: It's like.

594
00:35:49,533 --> 00:35:51,179
Scott: Oh look a Sony TV.

595
00:35:51,862 --> 00:35:54,191
Scott: You know it does not a lot of it's not that kind of.

596
00:35:54,251 --> 00:35:54,974
Scott: you know like.

597
00:35:54,994 --> 00:35:58,389
Scott: there's not some electronics company That is exclusive to say France.

598
00:35:58,409 --> 00:36:00,700
Scott: You know you can't see that stuff anywhere.

599
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:06,180
Scott: You know maybe there's you know car models that are only sold in other countries, but you know it's it's getting very globalized.

600
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:13,479
Scott: But when the world was cut by the Cold War Russia had all this shit that no one else had and we had all this shit that Russia didn't have.

601
00:36:13,539 --> 00:36:22,414
Scott: so When you look at the Russian computers like wow you know they didn't have no univacs or anything like that, so They got all this cool stuff.

602
00:36:22,434 --> 00:36:23,180
Scott: and one interesting.

603
00:36:23,582 --> 00:36:25,309
Scott: There's a big article here with a few pictures.

604
00:36:25,811 --> 00:36:31,368
Scott: one interesting thing from the article was that you know Early on of course they were trying to you know basically out.

605
00:36:31,448 --> 00:36:44,577
Scott: invent the United States in terms of computer technology right, but eventually They just told the Russian computer scientists like give up just copy everything IBM does and then try to improve on it.

606
00:36:44,597 --> 00:36:46,970
Scott: stop trying to beat them by developing from scratch.

607
00:36:47,979 --> 00:36:49,486
Scott: I Thought that was that was pretty humorous.

608
00:36:49,747 --> 00:36:49,948
Scott: well.

609
00:36:50,370 --> 00:37:02,589
Rym: I recall way back in the day playing Aerobiz and Aerobiz supersonic on the SNES and I always play like a European country or America or something And I'd always see that I can the Eastern Bloc.

610
00:37:02,709 --> 00:37:09,233
Rym: there'd be these plane companies other than Boeing and Airbus and such McDonnell Douglas, but I can never buy the planes.

611
00:37:09,253 --> 00:37:13,300
Rym: whenever I tried to send a representative there They'd be like we can't buy Eastern Bloc planes.

612
00:37:13,441 --> 00:37:14,891
Rym: I was there was always this mystique about them.

613
00:37:15,516 --> 00:37:20,060
Rym: so one day I played as the Russians and said and I could buy Eastern Bloc planes.

614
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:24,520
Rym: Let me tell you those Tupolev and Ilyushin planes were the biggest pieces of shit.

615
00:37:25,644 --> 00:37:26,999
Rym: They were more expensive and worse.

616
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,999
Scott: Yeah, that's totally how it works over there.

617
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:36,723
Scott: so if you want to see some more expensive and worse computers from Russia from the 60s the likes of which you've probably Never seen.

618
00:37:36,743 --> 00:37:40,100
Scott: this is a good article for reading and looking at the pictures.

619
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:50,840
Rym: It's weird though how as much as you know the Soviet Union was basically this economic disaster But the styling of the Eastern Bloc in my opinion for whatever reason was pretty damn cool.

620
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:54,300
Scott: I know you look at these things right and I mean univax pretty cool.

621
00:37:54,380 --> 00:38:01,263
Scott: But these things they look like they belong in like some awesome like sci-fi movie like Soviet Bloc apartments and Soviet car There's.

622
00:38:01,444 --> 00:38:03,199
Rym: there's this mystique about cool.

623
00:38:04,404 --> 00:38:05,047
Scott: They have right.

624
00:38:05,067 --> 00:38:11,220
Scott: the ones where it's like just vacuum tubes and the vacuum tubes have numbers in them And it looks like some sort of crazy Frankenstein thing love those things.

625
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:15,260
Scott: Yeah, I got to get one of those, but you know they just had like this great style to it.

626
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,469
Scott: I don't know like why the style is great.

627
00:38:17,489 --> 00:38:17,650
Scott: like.

628
00:38:17,771 --> 00:38:19,960
Scott: is it as the aesthetics of the stuff itself?

629
00:38:20,121 --> 00:38:23,580
Scott: Or is it the fact that you know we didn't see stuff like that in this side of the world?

630
00:38:23,815 --> 00:38:25,648
Scott: Yeah I wish I could figure out what it is about it.

631
00:38:25,668 --> 00:38:27,878
Scott: that makes it so awesome in the way it looks.

632
00:38:27,959 --> 00:38:31,112
Scott: at least It's like the fact that it came from a terrible situation.

633
00:38:32,475 --> 00:38:40,306
Rym: So SSL there was an article about self-signed certificate and all that stuff on Is it?

634
00:38:40,507 --> 00:38:42,479
Scott: will we get in trouble if I just call it a racket?

635
00:38:42,499 --> 00:38:42,539
Scott: ah?

636
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,785
Rym: Racketeering is a word.

637
00:38:44,865 --> 00:38:45,970
Rym: I may or may not have used.

638
00:38:46,211 --> 00:38:48,180
Scott: let me let me explain the situation here.

639
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,170
Scott: So people know what this is about.

640
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:51,034
Scott: right you know how.

641
00:38:51,074 --> 00:38:53,470
Scott: sometimes you go to a website And you want to buy something.

642
00:38:53,631 --> 00:39:05,303
Scott: usually when you're buying something But also for other situations, and you know this lock appears in your web browser Or maybe your web browser turns green and it says you know you are secure and safe right you know That's.

643
00:39:05,486 --> 00:39:06,538
Scott: that's what SSL is.

644
00:39:06,579 --> 00:39:07,723
Scott: now What SSL does?

645
00:39:07,743 --> 00:39:09,247
Scott: is it does two things.

646
00:39:09,348 --> 00:39:12,697
Scott: probably does a lot of things but does primarily two things.

647
00:39:13,058 --> 00:39:13,580
Scott: the first thing?

648
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:18,540
Scott: It does is it guarantees that the website you think you're at is the website you are.

649
00:39:21,381 --> 00:39:24,549
Scott: So let's say I'm at amazon.com, and it turns green.

650
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:37,940
Scott: that means I know I am at amazon.com and none of this information I'm typing in to the form on the website is going to say Google or Who knows who else unless Amazon gives it to them on the back end right the?

651
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:42,060
Scott: Communications between me and that web server are just between me and that web server.

652
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:45,812
Scott: There's no one snooping on it or anything like that and the number two thing.

653
00:39:45,853 --> 00:39:47,097
Scott: so it's anti-phishing right.

654
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:50,829
Scott: the number two thing It does is it has some sort of symmetric encryption right.

655
00:39:51,211 --> 00:39:56,952
Scott: so if someone is just like snooping the packets They just see this garbledy garbledy garbledy, and they can't see.

656
00:39:56,972 --> 00:39:58,820
Scott: you know what I'm typing in and spy on it.

657
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:01,347
Scott: Right and that's what SSL is supposed to do.

658
00:40:01,447 --> 00:40:16,780
Scott: and that's why if you are engaging in a secure transaction online You know typing in your credit card number your social security number anything along those lines You want to make sure that you send a little lock up in the you know location bar of your web browser.

659
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:22,419
Scott: But also you want to make sure that the URL in the location bar is the website you think you're dealing with.

660
00:40:22,439 --> 00:40:23,706
Scott: you know Even if it's secure.

661
00:40:23,967 --> 00:40:30,417
Scott: if you send your shit to some shady site well You know I mean I could give a secret encoded message to some.

662
00:40:30,517 --> 00:40:34,069
Scott: you know Criminal on the street, and I still gave it to.

663
00:40:34,089 --> 00:40:35,292
Scott: you know it doesn't help me.

664
00:40:35,653 --> 00:40:39,844
Scott: No one else got it, but the criminal, but hey That's how things go.

665
00:40:40,025 --> 00:40:43,295
Rym: so here's the problem with the way SSL really works.

666
00:40:43,356 --> 00:40:50,359
Rym: is that to get that certificate You basically just have to pay some arbitrary person enough money, and then they give it to you.

667
00:40:50,459 --> 00:40:55,540
Scott: yep See let's say I mean there's nothing preventing me from just making a certificate and setting it up.

668
00:40:55,822 --> 00:40:57,600
Rym: They're called self-signed certificates.

669
00:40:57,741 --> 00:40:59,735
Rym: I make the certificate and I sign.

670
00:40:59,776 --> 00:41:00,400
Rym: that is legitimate.

671
00:41:00,521 --> 00:41:07,212
Rym: But web browsers because of the way the internet is Basically like you know those locks are the special things that they'll show.

672
00:41:07,293 --> 00:41:14,340
Rym: like Firefox now has that nice like blue Bar that appears next to the URL to show they have a lock and they have an extra special lock.

673
00:41:14,601 --> 00:41:15,645
Scott: It's like the double lock.

674
00:41:15,946 --> 00:41:22,170
Rym: basically you can't get that unless you pay one of these companies for their Certificate or get them to sign your certificate.

675
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:24,860
Scott: Yes, basically it doesn't cause them any money to do it all they do.

676
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:38,891
Scott: It's just like you're paying for a rubber stamp a lot of money for a rubber stamp And you have to pay for it over and over again because your rubber stamp expires And they charge a lot for it now And it's technologically No Different at all from your own rubber stamp that you can.

677
00:41:38,912 --> 00:41:42,163
Scott: just I could spit out like a million of these things in a second With like a shell script.

678
00:41:42,644 --> 00:41:44,790
Scott: right now the thing is right.

679
00:41:45,151 --> 00:41:47,719
Scott: if I rubber stamp my own certificate right.

680
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:50,450
Scott: well How do you know that you know it's really me.

681
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:52,458
Scott: I could just use it on whatever freaking website.

682
00:41:52,518 --> 00:41:58,500
Scott: I want Right there's no guarantee that you know the certificate is actually for reals.

683
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,463
Scott: It is totally safe.

684
00:41:59,965 --> 00:42:03,578
Scott: You're basically these rubber stamps from these companies are basically you know okay?

685
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:10,620
Scott: We are Verisign and we guarantee that this is really Scott Rubin, and it's really front row crew calm stamp.

686
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:16,216
Scott: So it's basically you know if you see a certificate of my site that I side is.

687
00:42:16,236 --> 00:42:17,460
Scott: basically you have to decide.

688
00:42:17,864 --> 00:42:18,490
Scott: Do you trust me?

689
00:42:19,842 --> 00:42:28,760
Scott: But you know if you trust Verisign this company with rubber stamps Then you don't need to worry about whether you trust me or not because you know the Verisign is trustworthy.

690
00:42:28,902 --> 00:42:33,966
Scott: So really it's sort of like this trust in Economic network.

691
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:38,739
Scott: in a way you're paying for trust and you're trusting people who pay money.

692
00:42:39,362 --> 00:42:40,124
Rym: Now the real.

693
00:42:40,305 --> 00:42:51,660
Rym: this wasn't a problem until relatively recently in general because pretty much It was the kind of this cost of doing business and the only people who really use this sort of thing were Businesses that had we're collecting credit card information or something like that

694
00:42:52,521 --> 00:43:00,326
Scott: And the only people doing real e-commerce cared about it and anyone who's doing real e-commerce is making money because they're selling stuff And they could afford to have

695
00:43:00,346 --> 00:43:08,839
Rym: this dual problem of people using shoddy certificates and bad Urls to get people or you know fall you know spurious domains like amazon dot

696
00:43:08,939 --> 00:43:09,100
Scott: com.

697
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:13,500
Scott: You know you ever go to a website, and it says like the certificate has expired the certificate may be fake.

698
00:43:13,621 --> 00:43:16,560
Scott: That's because someone doesn't want to pay up, or they're legit.

699
00:43:16,661 --> 00:43:19,440
Scott: They're actually you know crooks, and they're trying to or they're incompetent.

700
00:43:19,481 --> 00:43:20,360
Rym: There's all sorts of reasons.

701
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:21,444
Scott: There's all sorts of reasons.

702
00:43:21,504 --> 00:43:27,691
Rym: the problem really is that one there's so many issues that this is kind of just like This show is basically just.

703
00:43:27,711 --> 00:43:29,300
Rym: I was kind of getting all the issues out there.

704
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:34,117
Rym: We can't really talk about any of them in super depth because each one deserves an entire Monday show in and of itself.

705
00:43:34,137 --> 00:43:35,585
Scott: basically also Just you know.

706
00:43:35,605 --> 00:43:41,960
Scott: to sum up the episode in case you don't listen anymore We're pissed because we have to pay a whole fucking ton of money if we want to have one of these things.

707
00:43:42,021 --> 00:43:42,969
Rym: It's not that much money.

708
00:43:43,373 --> 00:43:44,140
Scott: It's a lot of money.

709
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:45,144
Scott: It's like hundreds of dollars.

710
00:43:45,506 --> 00:43:48,438
Rym: There are a place like anything start SSL, which will actually give you one for free.

711
00:43:48,679 --> 00:43:51,695
Scott: really That's nice, and they're just really work in all the browsers.

712
00:43:51,715 --> 00:43:52,680
Rym: it works in most browsers.

713
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:53,904
Rym: They're pretty well trusted.

714
00:43:54,206 --> 00:43:56,815
Scott: and can I get the double plus lock or just the regular lock?

715
00:43:57,056 --> 00:43:58,160
Rym: probably just the regular lock.

716
00:43:58,180 --> 00:43:59,372
Scott: Yeah, I want the double plus lock.

717
00:43:59,392 --> 00:44:00,098
Rym: that one cost more.

718
00:44:00,681 --> 00:44:13,460
Rym: Because and they're always like that to pay money to make a symbol appear in a web browser at the same time It's only it's this kind of barrier to entry the old keep the riffraff out to where only legitimate kind of legitimate businesses can get them.

719
00:44:13,981 --> 00:44:19,040
Scott: But yeah think about the cost of this to Amazon is basically zero compared to what they add the money they actually have.

720
00:44:19,401 --> 00:44:26,489
Scott: but the cost of it to someone like me who's you know just running a little old website is Enormous compared to my hosting cost now.

721
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:27,755
Rym: It's tricky because on one hand.

722
00:44:27,815 --> 00:44:37,579
Rym: It's a little anti-competitive It's kind of this downward pressure against startups but the other hand it really stops a lot of the very trivial attacks that would bring the whole system down.

723
00:44:37,639 --> 00:44:47,057
Rym: because To get that lock cost so much money that if you're making a million spoofers spam domains You can't afford to do that because the margins on scamming already so low.

724
00:44:47,077 --> 00:44:54,260
Rym: yep So but the one of the real issues here is that because it's kind of this You know it's not a scarce supply anymore.

725
00:44:55,124 --> 00:45:02,537
Rym: I feel like the solution is that don't registrar should basically give Certificates to whoever buys a domain from them, and that's the end of it.

726
00:45:02,919 --> 00:45:03,702
Scott: yes I agree.

727
00:45:03,762 --> 00:45:08,239
Scott: however the problem is you know if a domain changes hands or if a domain expires they have to revoke.

728
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:15,345
Rym: the Certificate should automatically expire at the intervals of the domain expiring yep And they issue new ones.

729
00:45:15,466 --> 00:45:16,855
Rym: as they are they should expire.

730
00:45:16,935 --> 00:45:17,720
Scott: I completely agree.

731
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:28,200
Scott: You should just get a perfect SSL certificate with the domain And then it's up to you the person who runs the website not to like share the certificate around or do it the wrong way.

732
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:30,589
Rym: But there's this whole extra problem on the side of that.

733
00:45:31,432 --> 00:45:35,774
Rym: in the old days if the certificate was self-signed either It would just accept it or pop up a little warning.

734
00:45:35,835 --> 00:45:36,298
Rym: you click ok.

735
00:45:37,236 --> 00:45:54,717
Rym: But Most of the time a self-signed certificate or a shoddy certificate means either you're at Amazon instead of Amazon Or you're on a corporate internet that didn't want to pay for a certificate And or you're on some guy's website who just wanted to have like e-commerce now.

736
00:45:54,737 --> 00:45:55,320
Scott: Here's the thing though.

737
00:45:55,340 --> 00:46:01,825
Scott: Let's say we give a certificate to everyone right couldn't we just make the whole web as is L Like everything.

738
00:46:02,025 --> 00:46:03,109
Rym: there is a performance hit.

739
00:46:03,189 --> 00:46:05,416
Scott: there is a performance hit and there's no reason to.

740
00:46:05,497 --> 00:46:10,660
Scott: the other problem with it I think is that let's say everyone gets one of these and everyone makes everything secure, right?

741
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:13,590
Scott: Well, then it's like well the lock is always locked.

742
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:14,152
Scott: So how do I?

743
00:46:14,172 --> 00:46:16,600
Scott: there's no safe and unsafe situation?

744
00:46:16,981 --> 00:46:20,254
Rym: Well, it also gets a lot of the power down to the point of.

745
00:46:20,555 --> 00:46:21,800
Rym: did I type the URL, right?

746
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:22,402
Rym: I don't know.

747
00:46:22,583 --> 00:46:29,040
Scott: Yeah, there's a lot of power in the SSL now and that most of the time you're browsing the web It's not there, but it's not so when you're safe.

748
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:39,000
Rym: It's like aha there's the law but the root problem is it's never gonna actually be security because doing this Will always end up being security through credit card as opposed to security through obscurity.

749
00:46:39,261 --> 00:46:41,531
Scott: Yeah, well, you don't want security through obscurity or credit card.

750
00:46:41,551 --> 00:46:43,660
Scott: You want security through fucking real security.

751
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:46,795
Rym: The thing is security through credit card works pretty well in this situation.

752
00:46:46,856 --> 00:46:47,740
Rym: It really does work.

753
00:46:48,963 --> 00:46:49,907
Scott: It works better than nothing.

754
00:46:49,927 --> 00:46:50,349
Scott: That's for sure.

755
00:46:50,369 --> 00:46:52,479
Rym: The problem is this whole separate problem.

756
00:46:53,282 --> 00:47:01,856
Rym: There's an article in slash shot that this study shows that pretty much everyone just fucking ignores This and like they don't even know what that lock means.

757
00:47:01,876 --> 00:47:02,600
Rym: They just ignore it.

758
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,958
Scott: Yeah, I mean web browsers, you know have been trying to do a better job of.

759
00:47:05,999 --> 00:47:12,580
Scott: you know Changing the user interface of the security like ie if there's a bad ticket will like make the whole location bar red.

760
00:47:13,064 --> 00:47:14,960
Scott: You know like Firefox is a lot bigger.

761
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,955
Scott: Firefox is like I mean Netscape used to be this little tiny lock icon in the bottom right.

762
00:47:18,975 --> 00:47:20,665
Scott: that would appear and disappear and now It's nice.

763
00:47:20,705 --> 00:47:21,900
Rym: now will be your face.

764
00:47:22,333 --> 00:47:29,719
Rym: Hey This movie is bad and it gives you an error and you have to click on like four different things That are in different places to get past it.

765
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:30,101
Scott: Yep,

766
00:47:30,342 --> 00:47:36,107
Rym: and it seems like the majority of people will just click on anything they can and keep clicking and keep clicking until they get Through because

767
00:47:36,147 --> 00:47:41,655
Scott: that goes back to something that we talked about all the time Which is that most people use computers don't read, you know, there's.

768
00:47:41,695 --> 00:47:44,507
Scott: if there's words on the screen They will not read them whatsoever.

769
00:47:44,527 --> 00:47:45,571
Scott: No matter what the words are.

770
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:46,716
Scott: It could say warning.

771
00:47:46,736 --> 00:47:47,580
Scott: You're going to die.

772
00:47:47,681 --> 00:47:48,553
Scott: The computer will explode.

773
00:47:48,573 --> 00:47:49,059
Scott: they don't read it.

774
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:51,680
Scott: All they do is if anything pops up at all.

775
00:47:52,122 --> 00:47:54,894
Scott: All they do is click and click and click and click until it goes away.

776
00:47:55,196 --> 00:47:57,394
Scott: They don't read anything They don't think about right.

777
00:47:57,698 --> 00:48:03,420
Scott: so No amount of popping up or visual cues or anything is ever going to get through to people who don't read.

778
00:48:03,861 --> 00:48:04,323
Scott: See you what?

779
00:48:04,483 --> 00:48:09,460
Scott: the only way to actually make SSL work would be to actively say this website is insecure.

780
00:48:09,641 --> 00:48:13,719
Scott: Sorry, you can't go here no matter what by and just not let them go no matter what they do.

781
00:48:14,161 --> 00:48:18,140
Rym: But then that basically prevents your web browser from being used on most corporate internets.

782
00:48:18,381 --> 00:48:20,535
Scott: Well, what I would do actually is that's a good.

783
00:48:20,555 --> 00:48:21,340
Scott: that's a good point.

784
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:24,131
Scott: You brought up about the corporate internets right for a home user.

785
00:48:24,392 --> 00:48:35,082
Scott: maybe doing that is not so necessary but if I had a company I would set up the computers such that no one would be able to visit any site that had an expired or That.

786
00:48:35,423 --> 00:48:38,693
Rym: that basically unsolved the problem of how do I?

787
00:48:38,713 --> 00:48:40,960
Scott: well it keeps my company safe for my employees.

788
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:42,259
Rym: You don't read but you don't need that.

789
00:48:42,721 --> 00:48:47,760
Rym: The problem here is that normal people in their normal homes need to know whether or not they're actually on Amazon.

790
00:48:48,461 --> 00:48:50,692
Scott: Well, they don't pay attention anyway, so does it really matter?

791
00:48:50,752 --> 00:48:52,199
Scott: they're gonna get fucked no matter what we set up.

792
00:48:52,882 --> 00:48:56,700
Rym: Well, I don't know what to do about it because here's the situation where - if you give them the information.

793
00:48:56,801 --> 00:49:02,952
Rym: Even if they read the pop-up with stuff like certificate They have no idea what it means and there's no way to really explain it.

794
00:49:03,012 --> 00:49:08,211
Rym: because if you give the actual explanation No one's gonna understand what a certificate is or what it means.

795
00:49:08,572 --> 00:49:10,500
Rym: and if you give a dumb explanation you dumb it down.

796
00:49:11,141 --> 00:49:12,670
Rym: They'll just say what do you mean?

797
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:13,334
Rym: I can't go here.

798
00:49:13,354 --> 00:49:13,917
Rym: It's Amazon.

799
00:49:13,958 --> 00:49:16,560
Scott: Fuck you What I would do is I would put up a series of questions.

800
00:49:16,741 --> 00:49:21,037
Scott: Right and the questions would be like are you a hundred percent sure that you're actually Firefox?

801
00:49:21,077 --> 00:49:21,780
Rym: basically does that?

802
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:22,444
Rym: It doesn't work.

803
00:49:22,645 --> 00:49:23,752
Scott: people just keep the way it words.

804
00:49:23,833 --> 00:49:24,840
Scott: It is not that plain.

805
00:49:25,241 --> 00:49:26,666
Rym: It says there is an error.

806
00:49:26,807 --> 00:49:27,730
Rym: do not continue.

807
00:49:27,991 --> 00:49:40,740
Rym: and if you and if you just look and you click on like the nice-looking Answer, it doesn't let you go You have to go back and click on the scary-looking X and even then you have to go then it you have to say yes I understand you have to get the certificate.

808
00:49:40,881 --> 00:49:46,706
Scott: So you say are you saying that since people will go through the trouble of visiting the site even with a bad certificate We don't need to pay for the thing.

809
00:49:46,726 --> 00:49:48,453
Scott: We can just use the signed one the self-signed.

810
00:49:48,775 --> 00:49:49,799
Rym: We probably could.

811
00:49:50,942 --> 00:49:54,900
Scott: The problem is it's unprofessional and it is it is very unprofessional.

812
00:49:54,900 --> 00:50:08,260
Rym: It's also a situation where it's your website the system works well enough to where security through credit card Is still pretty viable and if you're gonna do e-commerce today, you should pay for one of these certificates.

813
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:19,060
Scott: Well, I do think though that Well, you know while what we have is okay, and even though we should still try to find a better solution I think that there should be sort of an iron monkey pricing system.

814
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:27,954
Scott: You remember an iron monkey when he's sitting there right and as a rich man who comes to get some medicine and as a homeless Poor man, right and he gives the poor man the free medicine.

815
00:50:27,975 --> 00:50:30,849
Scott: and there he tells the rich man It's like 30 tells or whatever.

816
00:50:30,869 --> 00:50:33,682
Scott: right and he's like he got the same medicine for free What the fuck.

817
00:50:34,004 --> 00:50:36,615
Scott: and he's like, you know, hey rich man, maybe you can't afford it.

818
00:50:36,916 --> 00:50:40,519
Scott: and he's like, oh shit He was too proud not to be you know, so he paid him up.

819
00:50:41,142 --> 00:50:44,820
Scott: I think that you know, the SSL should cost more for Amazon than it cost for me.

820
00:50:45,081 --> 00:50:49,800
Rym: But then do we differentiate on the user side the difference on the user side?

821
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,688
Rym: Because if you do we're in the same boat.

822
00:50:51,708 --> 00:50:52,492
Rym: We're in now doesn't matter.

823
00:50:52,512 --> 00:50:59,760
Rym: This is exactly the same as it is now And if we don't differentiate then I pay zero because I have this, you know, I don't make any money.

824
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:04,920
Rym: I'm just some guy for Amazon and then I proceed proceed to scan people and make all this money.

825
00:51:05,201 --> 00:51:14,366
Rym: Yeah, so we're in this situation to where the system still works now and is going to continue to work for the foreseeable future and Relatively few people are affected by this.

826
00:51:14,587 --> 00:51:18,038
Scott: It's basically a big old glass house, but the system is someday going to.

827
00:51:18,299 --> 00:51:20,270
Scott: it's a big old Tower made of cars someday.

828
00:51:20,351 --> 00:51:24,759
Rym: This is basically going to break down Catastrophically balsa wood bridge and I don't know what to do about it.

829
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:25,662
Scott: What do you know?

830
00:51:25,843 --> 00:51:31,320
Rym: also independently aside from all that it is not trivial to set this shit up in Apache.

831
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:36,180
Scott: It's moderately Troublesome, I mean, it's only a little bit difficult.

832
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:42,840
Rym: I know how to do it, but even I have run into problems like I had to set up a chain certificate Which I didn't know even know.

833
00:51:44,642 --> 00:51:50,643
Rym: So I had to basically set up our certificate this root certificate and then a chain of authority that went all the way down to my certificates.

834
00:51:50,663 --> 00:51:52,129
Rym: I had these multiple certificates to set up and

835
00:51:52,651 --> 00:52:04,484
Scott: though that's the worst thing is if you got subdomains It's like sometimes you need to get more certificates sometimes you need to get like broader certificates and like if we want to have a different certificate for like forum dot front recruit calm and front row crew calm.

836
00:52:04,524 --> 00:52:06,170
Rym: and also the situation of some.

837
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:07,796
Scott: we gotta pay again and again and again.

838
00:52:07,856 --> 00:52:14,220
Rym: some people who sell certificates are More or less reliable and maybe a browser will stop trusting one certificate authority because they're bad.

839
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:17,040
Scott: And yeah, like, you know fire for the people you and that's the thing.

840
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:19,509
Scott: It's like the browsers really need to do something about it.

841
00:52:19,549 --> 00:52:22,460
Scott: Like, you know, if the browser let's say I'm Mozilla, right?

842
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,040
Scott: I decide the Verisign is trustworthy, right?

843
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:30,640
Scott: So any certificates that are signed by Verisign are gonna get the green flag in Firefox, right?

844
00:52:31,041 --> 00:52:36,040
Scott: Well, you know, why can't me Scott Rubin why can't I write a letter to Mozilla?

845
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,589
Scott: They should have someone whose job this is right to handle this.

846
00:52:39,131 --> 00:52:41,280
Scott: and I can be like, hey go look at my website.

847
00:52:41,601 --> 00:52:48,417
Scott: Here's my certificate that I made, you know and trust me because you see my website and you approve it even though I didn't pay Verisign any money.

848
00:52:48,477 --> 00:53:01,740
Scott: and they should have a person if they want to be deciding who to trust and who not to in place of the user then I should be able to apply for trust as A person with the website and a certificate to the browser as opposed to to this, you know.

849
00:53:02,761 --> 00:53:20,458
Rym: What would be nice is if a certificate authority basically like did all this investigation and hired like private investigators and basically what they did is verify based on P eyes and like spying on you and all sorts of craziness that yes, I certified that the person I gave this certificate to is the person they say they are.

850
00:53:21,141 --> 00:53:26,500
Scott: But then once they do you are now trusted and inside and then you can make as many certificates as you want.

851
00:53:27,201 --> 00:53:31,050
Rym: They have to continue to watch you Revoke that certificate.

852
00:53:31,090 --> 00:53:32,319
Rym: the second you fuck up, right?

853
00:53:32,841 --> 00:53:36,135
Scott: You'll have a private key that you can use the sign all your certificates.

854
00:53:36,155 --> 00:53:37,440
Rym: that would cost a lot of money.

855
00:53:37,581 --> 00:53:39,791
Rym: And again, no one can pay for that but the rich people.

856
00:53:40,012 --> 00:53:42,762
Scott: that's something else to think about right is Right.

857
00:53:42,862 --> 00:53:44,630
Scott: Imagine if you know, I saw it.

858
00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:46,900
Scott: Let's pretend it's like some magical fantasy land, right?

859
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:48,570
Scott: I sign all my certificates.

860
00:53:48,590 --> 00:53:49,576
Scott: you sign all yours.

861
00:53:49,677 --> 00:53:50,160
Scott: Joe signs.

862
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:52,209
Rym: Oh the way PGP is supposed to work, right?

863
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:54,600
Scott: Everyone signs their own certificates, right?

864
00:53:55,002 --> 00:53:58,860
Scott: And you know, everyone is sort of individually trusted now, right?

865
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:03,220
Scott: So that means let's say something crazy happens and someone breaks my private key.

866
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:07,532
Scott: Well only my certificates are in trouble right now.

867
00:54:07,633 --> 00:54:12,760
Scott: if I get like the Verisign private key I can fucking make certificates or fucking at all.

868
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:20,060
Scott: The internet is fucked totally fucked and it's only one private key just one Right for like a lot a lot of certificates.

869
00:54:20,321 --> 00:54:29,166
Scott: It would be much more secure if we had lots of different private keys for lots of different certificates from everybody in terms of encryption You know side of the thing.

870
00:54:29,186 --> 00:54:30,189
Rym: Well, here's another.

871
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:38,091
Rym: what if we had trust through consensus to where everyone has their own private key and You can sign or trust other people's keys.

872
00:54:38,131 --> 00:54:41,440
Rym: So my private key, I trust the real Amazon certificate.

873
00:54:41,802 --> 00:54:45,158
Rym: So the real Amazon certificate has you know, 10 million people have trusted it.

874
00:54:45,781 --> 00:54:49,279
Rym: Amazon has the 500 people in the small botnet trusting it.

875
00:54:49,581 --> 00:54:53,640
Scott: Oh, that wouldn't be bad like because most people, you know, most internet people wouldn't bother it, right?

876
00:54:53,760 --> 00:55:02,139
Scott: But all of the web people would go around Trusting certificates like they'd be like walking around with petitions like hey dude from this other website.

877
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,189
Scott: I know you know, trust me.

878
00:55:04,209 --> 00:55:06,720
Scott: Hey all my listeners to this podcast.

879
00:55:06,902 --> 00:55:15,260
Rym: Now you need you to sign our certificate and trust us System to where you signing has weight depending on how many people have signed yours in this kind of clusterfuck.

880
00:55:15,446 --> 00:55:19,660
Rym: Yeah The problem with that is that who where do my root certificates come from?

881
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:22,493
Scott: Basically, whoever has the most Twitter followers against the most security?

882
00:55:22,554 --> 00:55:23,780
Rym: not only that but alright.

883
00:55:23,921 --> 00:55:28,580
Rym: So I write a spam bot that just generates a billion certificates that all sign each other.

884
00:55:29,127 --> 00:55:29,879
Rym: So that doesn't yeah.

885
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:33,000
Scott: But the thing is that wouldn't be attached to anyone in your web of trust.

886
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:37,740
Scott: So your trust level for it would be zero because you had have no connections to that insular network.

887
00:55:38,324 --> 00:55:40,420
Scott: See, it's it's a whole trust network situation.

888
00:55:40,501 --> 00:55:42,700
Rym: The thing is they we can't really get into it.

889
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:48,620
Rym: But the logistics of that and then math of that is I could I could make that in my laboratory.

890
00:55:49,342 --> 00:55:51,200
Scott: Don't ask me to make it for the Internet.

891
00:55:51,361 --> 00:55:54,820
Rym: So that would be one of those like everyone bands together for peace and prosperity.

892
00:55:54,981 --> 00:55:57,633
Scott: I can make it in my laboratory and it would be like.

893
00:55:57,653 --> 00:56:01,066
Scott: that would be the kind of thing you would give someone is Like a CS project in college.

894
00:56:01,146 --> 00:56:05,220
Scott: It would not be something that you would actually be able to make happen in the world.

895
00:56:06,221 --> 00:56:09,152
Scott: It'd be like, you know, it'd be a good like question like here's the web of trust.

896
00:56:09,494 --> 00:56:11,120
Scott: how much should Joe trust Jake?

897
00:56:11,501 --> 00:56:15,520
Scott: You know, he's like, well Joe should just shake three three trust three trust.

898
00:56:17,981 --> 00:56:19,285
Scott: Much you know Mary.

899
00:56:19,365 --> 00:56:20,588
Scott: trust, you know Jake.

900
00:56:20,649 --> 00:56:24,880
Scott: now that Jay, you know, Joe doesn't trust Jake anymore zero trust.

901
00:56:25,001 --> 00:56:26,599
Scott: Yeah, it's like one other way.

902
00:56:27,422 --> 00:56:28,144
Rym: The you know.

903
00:56:28,285 --> 00:56:30,652
Rym: again what this really comes down to is identity.

904
00:56:31,053 --> 00:56:32,578
Rym: and way back and open everything.

905
00:56:32,618 --> 00:56:33,220
Rym: New York City.

906
00:56:35,427 --> 00:56:38,060
Rym: Was it 2008 was 2009?

907
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:39,568
Rym: It was eight because it was still warm out.

908
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:41,800
Rym: was it or was it not that long ago?

909
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:42,402
Rym: And I'm just.

910
00:56:42,462 --> 00:56:43,386
Rym: and maybe it was spring.

911
00:56:43,406 --> 00:56:44,690
Scott: I think it was spring.

912
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:46,437
Rym: I don't already don't remember.

913
00:56:46,477 --> 00:56:47,320
Scott: I think it was spring.

914
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,024
Scott: I'll say all nine.

915
00:56:48,104 --> 00:56:49,230
Rym: I was wearing the shirt like yesterday.

916
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:51,020
Rym: Anyway, the first open everything, New York City.

917
00:56:52,122 --> 00:57:12,568
Rym: one of the things that I brought up and talked about a great deal was the idea that In the future going forward the most important thing to solve on the internet and in the world is identity and the most important commodity in the world is being able to prove reliably who you are and What it really comes down to is when everyone is born.

918
00:57:12,608 --> 00:57:16,260
Rym: They need to be given a USB key that has their private key.

919
00:57:16,401 --> 00:57:17,849
Scott: What about are you doing USBs done?

920
00:57:18,211 --> 00:57:20,706
Rym: Well, you know when I say USB key I mean whatever technology.

921
00:57:20,726 --> 00:57:22,376
Rym: at the time we implant a chip in you out.

922
00:57:22,396 --> 00:57:23,020
Rym: It doesn't matter.

923
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:27,120
Rym: You have to have scaling technology to where everyone is issued a private key.

924
00:57:27,562 --> 00:57:33,670
Rym: That is used the way social security numbers are now and you sign things with that And if you lose it you have to report it to the government.

925
00:57:33,690 --> 00:57:36,442
Rym: then they revoke it and then they give you a new One.

926
00:57:36,904 --> 00:57:40,783
Rym: maybe you have to reapply for it every ten years the same way to your driver's license And it expires.

927
00:57:40,803 --> 00:57:41,807
Rym: and all that sort of business.

928
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:50,480
Rym: and until we have some sort of thing like that There's basically no way to solve this or a thousand other internet problems, you know.

929
00:57:50,540 --> 00:58:06,439
Scott: And in fact, actually if you think about it, right if the government set up some sort of private key system for every citizen You know, it had all the public keys in this giant database and everyone had their own private key in some secure fashion The government a lot of the government's other work would go away

930
00:58:07,163 --> 00:58:07,524
Rym: You know

931
00:58:07,565 --> 00:58:12,250
Scott: like to be a lot of things these wouldn't have to do if they could set that up and make it work Like a lot of other things.

932
00:58:12,291 --> 00:58:13,339
Scott: they wouldn't have to do so much.

933
00:58:13,842 --> 00:58:17,720
Scott: They would just be really easy because you just use the private keys and public keys for it like the mail.

934
00:58:18,421 --> 00:58:18,802
Scott: He's just.

935
00:58:18,842 --> 00:58:19,103
Scott: you know.

936
00:58:19,183 --> 00:58:22,154
Scott: private keys send mail, you know, Oh driver's licenses.

937
00:58:22,174 --> 00:58:27,872
Scott: Yeah, you don't need a driver's license ID You know, oh, you know, you know everyone, you know signing things.

938
00:58:27,953 --> 00:58:28,895
Scott: notaries wouldn't need.

939
00:58:28,916 --> 00:58:30,420
Scott: him wouldn't need the whole notary thing at all.

940
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:32,980
Scott: I forget his notarize everything themselves by digitally signing it.

941
00:58:33,602 --> 00:58:38,517
Rym: If you did it with an issued private key that was hashed with some security wouldn't need some biometric.

942
00:58:39,864 --> 00:58:43,126
Rym: Then you eliminate pretty much every Bay, oh great.

943
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:44,111
Rym: We've solved everything.

944
00:58:44,272 --> 00:58:46,404
Scott: Yeah, don't need some security cards We don't.

945
00:58:46,444 --> 00:58:48,600
Scott: you know taxes got to fill out all these tax forms.

946
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:53,440
Scott: I mean when you fill out taxes today, you still need to write down name address, right?

947
00:58:53,661 --> 00:59:01,294
Scott: Imagine you just did your taxes and you just you know, signed it with your private key and then the you know The IRS, you know took a public key and set up.

948
00:59:01,334 --> 00:59:01,515
Scott: Yep.

949
00:59:01,555 --> 00:59:02,520
Scott: This was definitely written.

950
00:59:04,182 --> 00:59:13,779
Rym: How bullshit is it that I signed something with my pen and Fax it and it's more reliable than like a PGP signature because people in court don't understand signatures and contracts.

951
00:59:14,444 --> 00:59:24,640
Scott: Everything would be easy because if you signed a contract Provable that you signed it and I was digging around in my trash They found some mail that was thrown away and they applied for a credit card in my name.

952
00:59:25,223 --> 00:59:27,114
Scott: If they don't have my private key, how could they sign it?

953
00:59:27,838 --> 00:59:32,896
Scott: They can't Right, you know all these problems just go away if they would do this one thing.

954
00:59:32,916 --> 00:59:33,599
Scott: That's it.

955
00:59:34,081 --> 00:59:38,280
Scott: However, then people worried about like, you know government ID systems and all that sort of stuff.

956
00:59:39,321 --> 00:59:47,553
Scott: Basically, all we're doing is give everyone everyone a number that you hold on to and never have to show to anyone In fact never should show to anyone and should never be.

957
00:59:47,814 --> 00:59:52,451
Scott: well under no circumstances Ever be forced to show it to anyone.

958
00:59:52,752 --> 00:59:57,500
Scott: court judge police government official Nobody will you ever have to show that number?

959
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:07,014
Scott: All you will ever be required to do is sign things with the number then hand over the signed Thing which can then be verified with the public key.

960
01:00:07,256 --> 01:00:16,470
Scott: you will and you know And in fact, you'll be strongly encouraged never to show the private key to anyone not even family members Not even your own mother and nobody zero

961
01:00:17,293 --> 01:00:17,855
Rym: and in fact,

962
01:00:17,936 --> 01:00:18,960
Scott: so it's not like, you know

963
01:00:21,004 --> 01:00:25,180
Rym: Obviously, we can't have the midwife every time a cat child is born give them their key and then kill them.

964
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:25,422
Rym: So

965
01:00:25,462 --> 01:00:51,480
Scott: now you'd have to have some sort of system where like, you know Eventually, you're not gonna need this number when you're in say elementary school, you know, maybe right We'll have some sort of system where you know, you go into a booth and it you know It's a sealed booth and the machine generates the key puts the private public key in a database Prints out the private key somehow to give to you onto a device or a Piece of paper who knows what and then erases it from its memory and then you step out of the booth.

966
01:00:51,988 --> 01:00:52,579
Scott: It's that simple.

967
01:00:53,403 --> 01:01:01,720
Scott: There you go done And you could use that to sign your SSL search on your website and people would know, you know That was definitely signed by this person.

968
01:01:01,901 --> 01:01:05,219
Scott: If there's a discrepancy they could look up in the government and you know.

969
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:06,163
Scott: Well, you are.

970
01:01:06,344 --> 01:01:08,635
Rym: we've solved the problem that for the first time on GeekNights.

971
01:01:08,656 --> 01:01:09,138
Rym: We solved it.

972
01:01:09,218 --> 01:01:09,520
Rym: It's done.

973
01:01:10,663 --> 01:01:12,334
Rym: Thanks, yeah, thanks for listening.

974
01:01:12,354 --> 01:01:13,160
Scott: there's never gonna happen.
