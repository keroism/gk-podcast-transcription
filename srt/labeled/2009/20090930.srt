1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:15,580
Rym: Hey, it's Wednesday September 30th, and this is GeekNights tonight the rewatching of anime.

2
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:26,927
Scott: Let's do this.

3
00:00:31,273 --> 00:00:33,241
Rym: Gave a co-worker cowboy bebop.

4
00:00:33,281 --> 00:00:35,570
Scott: today you give that to a lot of co-workers.

5
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:36,072
Rym: I do.

6
00:00:36,293 --> 00:00:39,628
Scott: you also give them gonorrhea often what yeah?

7
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:40,892
Rym: Kind of joke.

8
00:00:40,932 --> 00:00:46,741
Rym: is that just you know something else you give the co-workers all the time came out of nowhere And at least make a syphilis joke.

9
00:00:46,782 --> 00:00:47,990
Rym: you could bring it into sci-fi.

10
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:51,685
Scott: Well, I was gonna say got a sip of herpes aids, but people don't get that.

11
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:53,576
Scott: I Think they would have got.

12
00:00:53,616 --> 00:00:57,337
Rym: I think they would have gotten the joke though They wouldn't have gotten the deeper meaning of the gym.

13
00:00:57,438 --> 00:00:57,739
Rym: Yes.

14
00:00:57,799 --> 00:00:59,948
Scott: There's a far deeper meaning to the gun.

15
00:00:59,988 --> 00:01:00,570
Scott: is it for herpes?

16
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:03,322
Rym: Seriously gonorrhea, that's what you come up with.

17
00:01:03,502 --> 00:01:05,349
Scott: it was the first part of the goddess of herpes.

18
00:01:05,531 --> 00:01:07,359
Scott: So I just I went right into it.

19
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:13,577
Rym: usually when someone makes that joke they just say like AIDS Gonorrhea a little too specific there.

20
00:01:13,597 --> 00:01:14,259
Rym: Well.

21
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,567
Scott: It's funnier when you're specifically regardless.

22
00:01:16,828 --> 00:01:18,136
Rym: this dude You know my co-worker.

23
00:01:18,176 --> 00:01:19,204
Rym: He plays Left 4 Dead.

24
00:01:19,264 --> 00:01:23,350
Rym: He's kind of geeky He's he's getting into heroes right now, and he's really liking it.

25
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,326
Rym: But I know he's gonna go through the same thing.

26
00:01:25,366 --> 00:01:25,810
Rym: everyone goes.

27
00:01:25,972 --> 00:01:30,202
Scott: I'm not a fan of the television obviously But I've heard people talk about that television.

28
00:01:30,282 --> 00:01:31,990
Rym: everyone smart agrees here.

29
00:01:32,111 --> 00:01:40,290
Rym: They say that like one season was good and all the other seasons Yeah, the first season is basically it's as good as like an average like pretty good anime like it's kind of like that.

30
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:44,527
Rym: And then they do what they do at every show in America as they water it down and span it out.

31
00:01:44,547 --> 00:01:50,650
Rym: a bunch more crap Seasons mm-hmm, so you know he was complaining about that like yeah, I hear the show's gonna be crap after the first season.

32
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:51,530
Rym: Why do they water it down?

33
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:57,984
Rym: And I was like I got a show that doesn't get watered down and the dude already likes Guy Ritchie movies and stuff like that.

34
00:01:58,004 --> 00:02:02,199
Rym: so There's no way he's not gonna like cowboy bebop.

35
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,030
Scott: There's no way any human being would not like.

36
00:02:05,572 --> 00:02:07,078
Rym: It's not a no true Scotsman.

37
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:09,407
Scott: It's a. it's a perfect alien detector.

38
00:02:09,548 --> 00:02:13,048
Rym: you see Most aliens like it, so it doesn't really help you out.

39
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:14,257
Scott: well No, but it's it's.

40
00:02:14,681 --> 00:02:17,899
Scott: it's like it has False negatives, but never.

41
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,549
Scott: I mean you know what I'm saying.

42
00:02:20,491 --> 00:02:21,454
Scott: It gets sometimes.

43
00:02:21,554 --> 00:02:27,070
Scott: it won't detect an alien when there is one, but if it detects an alien you know it detected an alien.

44
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:32,223
Rym: Well, I'll say this I mean like when we talk about Evangelion a lot of people say they don't like it, and there's debate about it.

45
00:02:32,283 --> 00:02:33,930
Rym: while I think those people are all wrong.

46
00:02:34,593 --> 00:02:36,402
Scott: No, that doesn't detect aliens.

47
00:02:36,463 --> 00:02:37,609
Scott: It takes stupid people.

48
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:41,036
Rym: I Think he's gonna watch.

49
00:02:41,096 --> 00:02:44,552
Rym: I told him you know cuz just to be sure I was like watch episode 5.

50
00:02:44,552 --> 00:02:46,490
Scott: Just you gotta watch episode 1 first.

51
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:46,973
Scott: It's far.

52
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:49,449
Scott: I mean episode 5 is clearly a superior episode.

53
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:50,755
Rym: I will say this and we did.

54
00:02:50,815 --> 00:02:52,783
Scott: we did watch episode 5 first.

55
00:02:52,823 --> 00:02:56,418
Scott: however we watched episode 5 Already being anime type people.

56
00:02:56,478 --> 00:02:59,290
Scott: I think episode 1 is far more accessible to the general.

57
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:01,186
Rym: I would argue that it depends.

58
00:03:01,468 --> 00:03:01,670
Rym: you can.

59
00:03:02,252 --> 00:03:07,570
Rym: Every different person has to watch a different episode of cowboy bebop first if you were getting them into anime from nothing.

60
00:03:08,173 --> 00:03:10,364
Rym: Some people are episode 5 kinds of people.

61
00:03:10,665 --> 00:03:11,670
Rym: some people are episode 1.

62
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,758
Scott: I think most people are episode 1 kind of people.

63
00:03:13,778 --> 00:03:15,545
Rym: some people are episode 2 kinds of people.

64
00:03:15,685 --> 00:03:20,539
Scott: no kids mostly Yeah, but episode 1 I think is the as the widest appeal thing is.

65
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:27,010
Scott: I think you know pretty much straight-up action western adventure that Everyone can dig with guns and fighting.

66
00:03:27,972 --> 00:03:30,630
Rym: There's not so much gun in the first episode as there is good kung-fu.

67
00:03:30,951 --> 00:03:34,005
Scott: No, there's a good gun in the in the in the bar.

68
00:03:34,286 --> 00:03:35,050
Rym: there is it's okay.

69
00:03:35,512 --> 00:03:37,742
Scott: And then there's the kung-fu outside in the.

70
00:03:38,024 --> 00:03:39,310
Rym: regardless, I know what's gonna happen.

71
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,263
Rym: He's gonna watch episode 5 and go holy shit.

72
00:03:41,283 --> 00:03:42,189
Rym: He's gonna watch the rest of the DVD.

73
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:47,761
Rym: I'm gonna give him the box set and then I'm gonna give him standalone complex And then we're gonna go down this room have standalone complex.

74
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:48,324
Rym: I ordered it.

75
00:03:48,806 --> 00:03:50,755
Rym: I'm cheap on Amazon And you know what cheap was it.

76
00:03:51,076 --> 00:03:51,457
Rym: it was $55.

77
00:03:51,457 --> 00:03:52,622
Rym: That's a lot.

78
00:03:52,763 --> 00:03:53,606
Rym: You know what it's worth it.

79
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:54,550
Rym: That shows just too great.

80
00:03:54,691 --> 00:03:55,516
Scott: I know I gotta watch it again.

81
00:03:55,677 --> 00:03:57,910
Rym: I know we'll watch it again together with the wine cellar.

82
00:03:58,051 --> 00:04:03,950
Scott: Oh, I forgot to tell you when we were at that Italian restaurant in the city Downstairs was like the fanciest fans.

83
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:09,690
Rym: You did tell me and I said when you went down there Did you think about that fan service the episode with Arimaki in the wine cellar?

84
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:10,253
Scott: Did you go?

85
00:04:10,273 --> 00:04:11,502
Scott: you should have gone down to see the wine cellar?

86
00:04:11,522 --> 00:04:12,670
Rym: I should have anyway.

87
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,775
Rym: Yeah, oh my god.

88
00:04:14,258 --> 00:04:15,986
Rym: You know I say this a lot, but I gotta say it again.

89
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:16,829
Rym: I like anime.

90
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:17,708
Rym: There's a lot of good anime.

91
00:04:18,331 --> 00:04:21,906
Rym: I've seen most of the good anime and or I've seen.

92
00:04:21,966 --> 00:04:26,990
Scott: if I haven't seen an anime I've seen one like it, but I mean that you know getting different moods different kinds of anime.

93
00:04:27,091 --> 00:04:33,007
Scott: Sometimes you're in the mood for that late night Always in the mood for another ghost in the shell standalone complex type show and there aren't enough of them.

94
00:04:33,268 --> 00:04:41,844
Rym: the other day You know I was working on something And I just in the on-demand put on like a random episode of standalone complex And it was even the dub and it was just some random episode.

95
00:04:41,884 --> 00:04:43,050
Rym: wasn't even that good of an episode.

96
00:04:43,911 --> 00:04:46,099
Rym: That is the show I want to watch right now.

97
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,107
Scott: I want to watch the boxing episode anyway.

98
00:04:48,508 --> 00:04:50,554
Scott: Ah let's That's.

99
00:04:50,594 --> 00:04:51,949
Rym: he got any got any news?

100
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:55,946
Scott: Well you see it's been a while since we did a Wednesday show or we forgot this news.

101
00:04:56,006 --> 00:05:06,610
Scott: on the last Wednesday show I'm not sure, but there was a gigantic Wednesday news Epic proportions Wednesday news that the Walt Disney corporation purchased the Marvel corporation.

102
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,097
Rym: I don't even know what to do about that.

103
00:05:08,137 --> 00:05:08,258
Rym: like.

104
00:05:08,499 --> 00:05:10,870
Rym: it is one of those things where I heard about it.

105
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,757
Rym: I heard rumors, but I hear rumors about everything.

106
00:05:12,777 --> 00:05:15,266
Rym: I ignored them when it actually happened.

107
00:05:15,286 --> 00:05:22,950
Rym: all the first thing I thought was that's a joke and then the second I thought someone's obviously hoaxed everybody and the third was really.

108
00:05:23,911 --> 00:05:24,954
Scott: Yeah, you know it's like.

109
00:05:25,015 --> 00:05:25,817
Scott: the thing is.

110
00:05:25,838 --> 00:05:27,223
Scott: it's like I don't.

111
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,210
Scott: there's just so much going on there.

112
00:05:29,732 --> 00:05:31,239
Scott: It's like I don't know what to say about it.

113
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:31,862
Scott: really.

114
00:05:31,902 --> 00:05:35,096
Rym: we have to do like a whole show on it But we got to wait and see what happens.

115
00:05:35,157 --> 00:05:39,535
Scott: right the thing is is that first of all I don't think anything is gonna Happen in the short term.

116
00:05:39,696 --> 00:05:42,587
Scott: It's gonna be just same business as usual in the short term right.

117
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:45,789
Scott: the only thing It's gonna happen the short term is stock market shit, right?

118
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:47,994
Scott: In the long term.

119
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:51,410
Scott: I know a lot of nerds out there are worried about the Marvel comics.

120
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,740
Scott: It's gonna happen in the Marvel comics.

121
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,668
Scott: I don't think they're gonna do anything with the Marvel come.

122
00:05:55,688 --> 00:06:05,509
Rym: not yet I think I see I have this vague idea of what I think they're going to do really is Poached bit by bit all the intellectual property of Marvel to make like feature films.

123
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:12,944
Scott: well No, they're just gonna continue the Marvel filmmaking as it is and just get all the money out of it Which is how they do?

124
00:06:14,311 --> 00:06:19,710
Scott: The same way that Pixar just keeps going about its business making its hot y'all movies and Disney just gets all the money.

125
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:37,592
Rym: I think the biggest change is going to be that's gonna come out of this is I think They're going to use like the infrastructure of Marvel like all that stuff, and they're going to have Lots and lots of comics made about Disney stuff that are really just promotional material because doesn't cost them that much to make it in House.

126
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,409
Scott: I don't think they'll do that.

127
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,435
Rym: I think they already have.

128
00:06:40,535 --> 00:06:43,390
Scott: you know the Disney comics are currently being done by boom studios.

129
00:06:43,551 --> 00:06:56,233
Scott: They'll probably just wait for the boom studios contract to run out eventually when it does and then they'll move all You know the duck whatever comics to just have Marvel print them instead, but the same people doing them You know I don't.

130
00:06:56,354 --> 00:06:59,544
Scott: I don't really foresee like a big any big moves.

131
00:06:59,564 --> 00:06:59,905
Scott: They're not.

132
00:06:59,946 --> 00:07:01,290
Scott: they're too big a corporation.

133
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:04,018
Scott: They're too dumb and unwieldy.

134
00:07:04,038 --> 00:07:05,622
Rym: They're not gonna do anything.

135
00:07:05,682 --> 00:07:08,430
Scott: That's agile or clever or a big chain.

136
00:07:08,571 --> 00:07:10,430
Rym: It's sad too because they're a big enough company.

137
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:11,475
Rym: They have so much money.

138
00:07:11,495 --> 00:07:17,569
Rym: basically the amount of money Marvel makes as far as I can gather is Like not even a blip on the radar of Disney over.

139
00:07:17,609 --> 00:07:19,274
Scott: well Here's something real interesting right?

140
00:07:19,495 --> 00:07:20,196
Scott: think about this.

141
00:07:20,798 --> 00:07:23,285
Scott: they bought Marvel for like four billion dollars right?

142
00:07:24,107 --> 00:07:30,219
Scott: I read recently that Adobe bought this company Omniture Which is a web stat company for two billion dollars.

143
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:41,241
Scott: that means if that Omniture guy who sold Omniture could have bought half of Marvel right Spider-man is pretty big, but spider-man is like maybe 40% of Marvel.

144
00:07:41,281 --> 00:07:47,481
Scott: that means he could have traded his web stat company for Spider-man, what would you do with spider-man?

145
00:07:47,521 --> 00:07:49,770
Scott: I would rather have spider-man than a web stat company.

146
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:52,102
Rym: I tell you that much, but what are you gonna do with spider-man?

147
00:07:52,142 --> 00:07:53,650
Rym: make some comics well first?

148
00:07:53,810 --> 00:08:00,128
Scott: I would like you know I would take all the Merchandise right - I would start the comic over from zero.

149
00:08:00,148 --> 00:08:02,930
Rym: now I would do the same one pissed off all the fanboys.

150
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:07,989
Rym: I would milk the merchandise to a degree that would make grown men cry absolutely.

151
00:08:08,591 --> 00:08:20,888
Scott: I would also make a lot more clever merchandise than they have made in the past, so I would make a spider-man Everything oh yeah, and I would make sure that there was quality Spider-man on TV around the world.

152
00:08:20,929 --> 00:08:30,760
Rym: first I would like have this plot like I'd commissioned internally some secret plot that led up to spider-man like dying and like and then After I made enough money to you know make it worth it.

153
00:08:31,482 --> 00:08:36,620
Rym: I would public domain spider-man see now I would be much more of a creative commons spider-man.

154
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,626
Scott: something like that be awesome of a jerk about it.

155
00:08:38,988 --> 00:08:43,116
Rym: to make money I would definitely definitely Compromise on open-source.

156
00:08:43,499 --> 00:08:46,212
Rym: you know whatever to make money I would.

157
00:08:46,273 --> 00:08:48,362
Scott: but the thing is I've already made two billion dollars.

158
00:08:48,784 --> 00:08:50,070
Scott: I saved enough left over.

159
00:08:50,111 --> 00:08:51,210
Scott: I don't need to make more money.

160
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:55,110
Rym: I'd make more money and I humor all the world's problems that my own space program.

161
00:08:55,170 --> 00:09:01,090
Scott: The thing is if I was gonna solve the world's problems I wouldn't use the two billion dollars from selling my web stack company to buy spider-man.

162
00:09:01,572 --> 00:09:05,005
Rym: I'm just saying spider-man could generate more than two billion dollars pretty handily.

163
00:09:05,126 --> 00:09:05,768
Scott: I don't think so.

164
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,869
Scott: I think I bought all of Marvel for four.

165
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,817
Rym: So yeah, I mean what you know.

166
00:09:11,837 --> 00:09:20,450
Rym: all the merchandising all that I have the crazy like the gigantic like oh my god They killed spider-man for serious, and then I make the further like big new all this press.

167
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:21,961
Rym: Just I'd make all the spider-man price.

168
00:09:22,001 --> 00:09:26,458
Rym: the next thing I do after that is Publicly like fire, but I wouldn't really fire like it.

169
00:09:26,478 --> 00:09:30,755
Rym: he paying him under the covers fire everyone involved in spider-man and act like yeah He's dead.

170
00:09:30,796 --> 00:09:31,789
Rym: Why would we make more comics?

171
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:42,366
Rym: Yeah, and I'd wait like six months, and then I'd be like you know what we're bringing him back with a 100% reboot, and it is no longer tied to Marvel in any way.

172
00:09:42,406 --> 00:09:43,590
Rym: there is no continuity.

173
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:53,460
Rym: This is a completely separate brand new fuck all you fanboys universe which again would generate crazy Bad press which means good press because this thing is bad press.

174
00:09:53,741 --> 00:09:56,890
Rym: yep, and then I make like a thousand spider-man movies.

175
00:09:57,273 --> 00:09:58,782
Scott: That's what ultimate spider-man is.

176
00:09:58,883 --> 00:09:59,910
Scott: is they started it over again.

177
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:05,650
Scott: The thing is they started it over again a long time ago already was years ago already, so they built up cruft again.

178
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,097
Scott: Yeah, it's like it's not it is.

179
00:10:07,177 --> 00:10:07,599
Rym: It's weird.

180
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:09,890
Rym: superheroes are like ships at sea.

181
00:10:10,311 --> 00:10:11,797
Rym: They know if they're out there too long.

182
00:10:11,837 --> 00:10:15,873
Rym: they get barnacles all over their asses, and you got a periodically I don't know.

183
00:10:15,933 --> 00:10:18,201
Rym: kill him and get all the barnacles up.

184
00:10:18,482 --> 00:10:19,786
Rym: my analogy breaks down there.

185
00:10:19,947 --> 00:10:20,549
Scott: Yeah, it's all right.

186
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:25,233
Scott: anyway This is too much to say Right now.

187
00:10:25,814 --> 00:10:27,018
Scott: it's too much to say about this.

188
00:10:27,118 --> 00:10:27,800
Scott: It's crazy.

189
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:29,745
Scott: really nothing's gonna happen.

190
00:10:30,206 --> 00:10:31,390
Scott: nothing super big.

191
00:10:31,894 --> 00:10:33,850
Scott: It's nothing that anyone any Disney or Marvel.

192
00:10:35,071 --> 00:10:35,533
Rym: We've made.

193
00:10:35,553 --> 00:10:42,989
Rym: our you know our wild claims what we would do and we Cannot really make any good predictions other than nothing's gonna happen.

194
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:44,577
Rym: Everything's gonna happen.

195
00:10:44,597 --> 00:10:46,010
Scott: I don't know nothing's gonna happen.

196
00:10:46,131 --> 00:10:47,310
Scott: I think not for years and years.

197
00:10:47,451 --> 00:10:51,427
Rym: I think we would be in a better position if we wait it until something happens and then talk about.

198
00:10:51,508 --> 00:10:54,197
Scott: I think that is The way to go, but it's gonna be years many years.

199
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:55,442
Rym: We'll see we'll see what happens.

200
00:10:55,562 --> 00:11:00,453
Rym: Yep it the thing is I Don't care Necessarily.

201
00:11:00,533 --> 00:11:02,063
Scott: oh, you know what's gonna happen in the short term.

202
00:11:02,103 --> 00:11:08,410
Scott: all the Marvel employees again I've like changed their insurance and do all this HR paperwork, and it depends depends on what kind of redundancy.

203
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:09,514
Scott: No, I'm sure there are.

204
00:11:09,554 --> 00:11:11,361
Scott: cuz I saw some tweets from some Marvel people.

205
00:11:11,381 --> 00:11:15,134
Scott: They're like moving offices, and you know It's that kind of thing.

206
00:11:15,496 --> 00:11:18,410
Rym: so we were at the New York anime festival over the weekend.

207
00:11:18,451 --> 00:11:23,163
Rym: We're not gonna do a whole show on it But there are newsworthy noteworthy items from it.

208
00:11:23,485 --> 00:11:24,690
Scott: a lot of mangas were licensed.

209
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:30,010
Rym: Yeah, we should start with the the bad first because I always hate to talk about just the bad stuff in a convention.

210
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:38,062
Rym: But there was one really really bad thing at the New York anime festival And you said thing is it came out of a really good thing.

211
00:11:38,142 --> 00:11:41,576
Rym: I won't dignify that with comment, so They got to me.

212
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:43,270
Rym: No you know kill them all to me.

213
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,053
Rym: No Gundam to me.

214
00:11:45,113 --> 00:11:50,489
Scott: no the creator of Gundam period the guy areas and they obviously wouldn't say that he was.

215
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:51,323
Scott: you know He said he did it.

216
00:11:51,364 --> 00:11:54,182
Scott: of course He did it with help, but I know a lot of people involved in New York.

217
00:11:54,202 --> 00:11:59,467
Rym: anime festival is nuts and independently of that I know a lot of them are very smart, and they did like the right thing.

218
00:11:59,507 --> 00:12:04,949
Rym: they got to me No, and they made him the keynote speaker very good a keynote.

219
00:12:05,109 --> 00:12:07,294
Scott: yay Well attended.

220
00:12:07,314 --> 00:12:08,639
Rym: They made a big deal about it.

221
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:13,697
Rym: more people showed up to that keynote then showed up to like Ishiguro anything at Otakon.

222
00:12:13,737 --> 00:12:16,826
Rym: yeah very good job anime festival, and it was all set.

223
00:12:16,886 --> 00:12:21,241
Rym: it was super like and you know They had a problem were like a lot more people lined up than even they expected.

224
00:12:21,643 --> 00:12:24,112
Rym: so they moved it into the biggest room They had like.

225
00:12:24,132 --> 00:12:26,260
Rym: they did everything they could do to deal with the situation.

226
00:12:26,722 --> 00:12:35,430
Rym: all these people come in they got the cameras and everything And I don't know who the guy was that they had to translate for him, but the dude did not speak Japanese.

227
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:39,801
Scott: Yeah, they had a translator who basically couldn't translate at all.

228
00:12:39,821 --> 00:12:42,790
Scott: like it started out like he was going to have a professional translator.

229
00:12:42,911 --> 00:12:48,700
Rym: People like the dude was doing pretty badly and Emily's sitting with us And she's like that's not what Tamino said.

230
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,473
Rym: and so she starts like whispering in our ears into the real Translation.

231
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:57,838
Rym: and like as this is going on the audience is grumbling more and more because Tamino We can tell that he didn't know what he was doing.

232
00:12:57,858 --> 00:13:00,930
Rym: because Tamino would say like this very long thing and Emily would translate it.

233
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:07,550
Rym: It was this really insightful like comment and the translator would translate in like this one Kurt sentence Yeah.

234
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:11,770
Rym: And at one point like Tamino said a bunch and the translator paused for a while and said something really Kurt.

235
00:13:12,513 --> 00:13:16,390
Rym: And then Tamino like looks at him with these eyes of you didn't translate me for shade.

236
00:13:16,912 --> 00:13:21,847
Scott: Yeah like Tamino didn't speak English, but you don't need to speak English to know when the translator is fail.

237
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:30,637
Rym: so finally I you know he had all his staff up there and finally one of his staffers this lady and While it may have been slightly unprofessional.

238
00:13:30,697 --> 00:13:31,661
Rym: I think it was warranted.

239
00:13:32,243 --> 00:13:34,150
Rym: She basically just said in English to the crowd.

240
00:13:35,091 --> 00:13:40,027
Rym: I would just like to note that we will have the proper translation online and available for everyone later.

241
00:13:40,047 --> 00:13:41,612
Scott: Oh Snap.

242
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:46,150
Rym: and then the translator guy gets all pissy and starts arguing with her and I couldn't see the conversation.

243
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:49,728
Rym: but he's like me me me me me and she smacks him the fuck down.

244
00:13:49,748 --> 00:14:03,696
Rym: and Basically, eventually they just had him shut up and he sat there quietly not talking for the rest of the keynote While all of the staff up there who obviously were not ready to translate and are not professional translator Did the best they could.

245
00:14:03,937 --> 00:14:10,240
Scott: thing is they had this guy up there who wrote some book and lived in Japan And you know he lived in like Tokyo and New York or something.

246
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:12,428
Scott: and I'm like why did that guy translate like?

247
00:14:12,448 --> 00:14:13,211
Scott: he was acting Like?

248
00:14:13,251 --> 00:14:20,570
Scott: he was like the emcee even though no one cared about him whatsoever and he was sorta a. but If he lives in Japan, shouldn't he know Japanese?

249
00:14:21,771 --> 00:14:22,194
Rym: Pointed out.

250
00:14:22,214 --> 00:14:28,871
Rym: I mean, it's one thing to be able to translate It's another thing to be able to translate on the spot in front of an audience, you know It's not.

251
00:14:28,891 --> 00:14:31,967
Scott: even if he did it slowly if it was correct, it would have been better.

252
00:14:32,068 --> 00:14:35,657
Scott: secondly He would Tamina was giving a prepared speech.

253
00:14:35,998 --> 00:14:37,563
Scott: when someone's giving a prepared speech.

254
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:41,897
Scott: You can have the translation already done in advance Yes, and someone can just read it.

255
00:14:42,038 --> 00:14:43,584
Scott: hint all of you need a translator.

256
00:14:43,604 --> 00:14:46,159
Rym: when we we've done this sort of though It's very good to have one.

257
00:14:46,381 --> 00:14:46,845
Rym: We've done it.

258
00:14:46,946 --> 00:14:47,450
Rym: I mean it depends.

259
00:14:47,551 --> 00:15:01,225
Rym: I don't know how prepared his speech was and how much he gave them at a time But it is a common trick if you're doing a very staged event where you know Someone's giving a so-called impromptu speech, but really like you've prepared everything ahead of time.

260
00:15:01,245 --> 00:15:01,626
Rym: Mm-hmm.

261
00:15:01,806 --> 00:15:03,110
Rym: You just translate everything ahead of time.

262
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:06,029
Rym: That's how the whole industry does it and then you still need a translator.

263
00:15:06,069 --> 00:15:09,481
Scott: though If you know people any if he says something that's not in the script or what?

264
00:15:09,522 --> 00:15:15,896
Rym: Yeah, but the worst thing was you know Emily was just translating for us and What he was saying was great.

265
00:15:16,116 --> 00:15:19,065
Rym: His message was basically look you fanboys.

266
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:28,310
Rym: I'm not gonna talk about your fanboy stuff I'm gonna talk about like what it really takes and it was really insightful and he yeah I was surprised like you expect Tamino to be one of those crazy dudes, right?

267
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:32,202
Scott: But really he was just like all you know, some of the other anime creators were.

268
00:15:32,604 --> 00:15:34,570
Scott: really all he cared about was film, right?

269
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:40,604
Scott: He's a big film guy like all the bit, you know Like Miyazaki is like Oh tomorrow is and like Satoshi khan is.

270
00:15:40,644 --> 00:15:43,417
Rym: but it was really telling when someone asked him Like how'd you get into all this?

271
00:15:43,457 --> 00:15:47,122
Rym: Like how did you and he was basically like, you know They paid me a lot of money.

272
00:15:47,143 --> 00:15:49,233
Scott: Yeah It's like he.

273
00:15:49,413 --> 00:15:54,290
Scott: he's been in the industry so long and he's like so locked in he's got like tenure.

274
00:15:54,812 --> 00:15:58,926
Scott: So he was like just willing to just be completely honest and scathing.

275
00:15:58,966 --> 00:16:01,215
Scott: He just came out with it Like they're like.

276
00:16:01,255 --> 00:16:04,045
Scott: why did you go back to Zeta Gundam again for the money?

277
00:16:04,266 --> 00:16:04,587
Rym: there's like.

278
00:16:04,707 --> 00:16:05,370
Rym: what was it like to work with?

279
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:06,052
Rym: Tezuka he's like.

280
00:16:06,072 --> 00:16:08,141
Rym: I won't comment because I'd make a lot of people mad.

281
00:16:08,362 --> 00:16:13,029
Scott: Yeah, it's like he dissed Tezuka He was like, yeah, I was like, oh shit doesn't does.

282
00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:16,630
Rym: no I think part of it too was that you know, he obviously he had a lot to say.

283
00:16:16,751 --> 00:16:19,006
Scott: He said the Gundam design was like a mega design.

284
00:16:19,026 --> 00:16:19,529
Scott: He didn't like it.

285
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,191
Rym: Yeah, he's like.

286
00:16:20,292 --> 00:16:29,143
Rym: I had great disagreements over the designs of the Gundams and we came to a compromise but I wasn't too happy Yeah, but part of it I think was that.

287
00:16:29,465 --> 00:16:36,985
Rym: I think honestly I believe he cut his speech short because of the translation problems because obviously the nuance was not getting across and there was a lot of nuance.

288
00:16:37,005 --> 00:16:46,604
Rym: there was indeed and He talked a lot about Star Wars, which is interesting because every keynote I've heard recently had pegs everywhere like everyone was inspired by Star Wars.

289
00:16:46,644 --> 00:16:53,130
Rym: then we showed the Daikon for animation at the New York Anime Festival and of course, there's all those Star Wars references in it.

290
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:57,910
Scott: Yeah, it's just lately like this just constant emphasis at least as you know in my its way.

291
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:58,933
Scott: It's what's it called?

292
00:16:58,953 --> 00:16:59,616
Scott: What's the name for that?

293
00:16:59,636 --> 00:17:01,362
Scott: where you keep the confirmation bias?

294
00:17:01,422 --> 00:17:11,067
Scott: Yes, definite recent confirmation bias Towards, you know seeing Star Wars everywhere and having it continually emphasized to me that like Star Wars changed everything.

295
00:17:11,268 --> 00:17:12,672
Scott: Star Wars Star Wars Star Wars.

296
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:16,143
Scott: Oh my god Star Wars from anime to video games everything.

297
00:17:16,204 --> 00:17:17,367
Rym: It was all Star Wars.

298
00:17:17,488 --> 00:17:22,650
Rym: guy at work I'm showing cowboy bebop has never seen a Star Wars movie all the way through.

299
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:23,655
Rym: He's seen little bits.

300
00:17:23,896 --> 00:17:25,021
Rym: He does not know the plot.

301
00:17:25,464 --> 00:17:26,589
Scott: I know there's people like that.

302
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:27,575
Scott: I know they exist.

303
00:17:27,695 --> 00:17:34,383
Scott: jeez when I worked at the dry cleaners and I was in high school The no people there who work there had seen Star Wars.

304
00:17:34,403 --> 00:17:37,374
Rym: the next time we run the animation see panel Can you just do the thing?

305
00:17:37,394 --> 00:17:49,510
Rym: We're like, you know, everyone in the audience is like, ah You know don't tell us the obvious stuff and we're like, alright guys Anyone who's not seen cowboy bebop raise your hand and like half the room will raise the hands and the other half the room goes.

306
00:17:49,595 --> 00:17:49,806
Rym: What?

307
00:17:51,452 --> 00:17:54,845
Rym: We got to do the same thing for Star Wars just to make the broad point that everybody's.

308
00:17:55,026 --> 00:18:01,170
Rym: uh, yep The sad thing is more people have seen Star Wars than have ever read like any Shakespeare.

309
00:18:02,451 --> 00:18:09,187
Scott: That's just because there's more people now and because they could if they could distribute the Shakespeare in the olden days And there was many people to distribute it to and they were literate.

310
00:18:10,052 --> 00:18:11,275
Scott: Then maybe yeah.

311
00:18:11,355 --> 00:18:20,568
Scott: Yeah and style the times anyway, but that aside also You know Star Wars is much more accessible whereas Shakespeare not so much.

312
00:18:20,929 --> 00:18:28,422
Rym: anyway I think that in addition to cutting his speech short he gave very Kurt Funny aphorism answers as opposed to long.

313
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:29,285
Rym: Yeah when anyone?

314
00:18:29,305 --> 00:18:40,387
Scott: yeah when anyone asked him questions He always gave this short like searing answer as opposed to an elaborate answer and also Shot the fanboys down like one guy was like.

315
00:18:40,749 --> 00:18:40,890
Rym: what?

316
00:18:40,973 --> 00:18:41,369
Rym: Would win?

317
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:44,115
Scott: Like?

318
00:18:44,155 --> 00:18:46,530
Rym: he looked and he was like and they just asked another question.

319
00:18:47,554 --> 00:18:59,514
Rym: yep, he clearly does not want to bother with fanboy crap anymore and It was so refreshing and great and I I just I'm so sad that the translator fucked it all up because I'm sure he had A lot more cool stuff to say.

320
00:18:59,695 --> 00:18:59,916
Scott: Yep.

321
00:18:59,976 --> 00:19:02,485
Scott: The only other thing I got to say about the nyaf that's negative.

322
00:19:02,545 --> 00:19:06,430
Scott: Is that it's sort of disorganized ish like just walking around?

323
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:15,730
Scott: You sort of get this feeling like you had a Children's Palace when it was going out of business like, you know Children's Palace by the way is a toy store that when it went out of business like everything was ultra discounted.

324
00:19:15,991 --> 00:19:19,590
Scott: It was and they basically got rid of all the employees except for the checkout employees.

325
00:19:19,911 --> 00:19:26,894
Scott: So basically it's like imagine giant giant shelves of toys and just all over the floor and all the hall Shelves knocked over.

326
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:30,370
Rym: I found like a Super Nintendo game under a pile of stuff and bought it for like five bucks.

327
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:33,070
Scott: Yeah, so I mean walking around the New York anime festival.

328
00:19:33,491 --> 00:19:38,370
Scott: It just sort of feels like like some moe like vomited all over the whole jab.

329
00:19:38,591 --> 00:19:39,514
Rym: It's the same time.

330
00:19:39,594 --> 00:19:43,990
Rym: I've realized like, you know, a lot of the problems with the New York anime festival.

331
00:19:44,131 --> 00:19:45,516
Scott: I really have its fault.

332
00:19:45,697 --> 00:19:51,265
Rym: They have nothing to do because the the people who run the New York anime festival They obviously are doing all the right things.

333
00:19:51,326 --> 00:19:51,829
Rym: They're doing it.

334
00:19:52,412 --> 00:19:57,167
Scott: It's plainly obvious that someone out there is listening to our show and taking our advice directly.

335
00:19:57,188 --> 00:19:58,735
Scott: They made a keynote They put.

336
00:19:58,937 --> 00:20:00,870
Scott: they called change the volunteers to heroes.

337
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:04,722
Rym: Yes, and the volunteers like it showed the volunteers were like really trying.

338
00:20:04,762 --> 00:20:07,350
Scott: Yeah, they were doing a lot better than previous years.

339
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:08,090
Scott: It was pretty cool.

340
00:20:08,155 --> 00:20:14,392
Rym: Yeah They spaced all the panels out like there was just a 15-minute gap between each panel which was just enough time to clear the room Sort everything out.

341
00:20:14,834 --> 00:20:20,330
Rym: They had the volunteers going around like holding up the 10-minute 5-minute signs making sure the panels ended on time.

342
00:20:20,651 --> 00:20:21,976
Rym: All the tech people were great.

343
00:20:22,197 --> 00:20:22,478
Scott: Yep.

344
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,505
Scott: Well the tech people are the union guys.

345
00:20:24,545 --> 00:20:30,350
Scott: for some reason they're great But the other perhaps the union guys who did the loading and unloading not so great depends on what union.

346
00:20:30,432 --> 00:20:33,579
Scott: I think I don't know Who knows what the situation is with that.

347
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,870
Scott: but the tech union at the Javits is good.

348
00:20:36,271 --> 00:20:41,935
Rym: But like every like they did everything right and I realized the biggest problem really just is that the Javits Sucks like.

349
00:20:41,975 --> 00:20:44,788
Rym: it is a terrible convention center for this kind of convention.

350
00:20:44,928 --> 00:20:45,290
Scott: Absolutely.

351
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:55,470
Rym: And also, you know where they put the NAF this year, you know in the bottom part of the Javits It's just the atmosphere of the building is kind of oppressive because it's really high but it's really like dark and dreary.

352
00:20:55,631 --> 00:21:05,130
Scott: So it really it feels like the ceiling is low like an Otakon Like the cement rooms like the artists alley like everything is bright white, you know, even the ceiling is bright white.

353
00:21:05,372 --> 00:21:12,847
Scott: It's it's you know, even though you're basically in a basement with no windows it's like you might as well the Sun might be might as well be shining in there and the ceiling is very high.

354
00:21:13,329 --> 00:21:19,297
Scott: and the Javits the ceiling is kind of high not as high as the Otakon ceiling but it feels very low Like it's right on top of you.

355
00:21:19,699 --> 00:21:20,644
Scott: It feels crowded.

356
00:21:20,664 --> 00:21:21,689
Scott: It's sort of dark.

357
00:21:21,931 --> 00:21:23,830
Scott: It's not bright and white and awesome in there.

358
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:26,518
Scott: So it just sort of makes this feel to the show.

359
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:29,266
Rym: that's sort of yeah plus the space like they.

360
00:21:29,286 --> 00:21:34,244
Rym: just they can't isolate sound And it's really just one big room with partitions and that's the biggest problem with anime.

361
00:21:34,284 --> 00:21:37,849
Rym: next the last time we went to that Much of the space was in that big like open area.

362
00:21:38,051 --> 00:21:41,569
Scott: It's just one room with partitions and you can hear everything all the time.

363
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:45,969
Scott: But there's like the sound is a mess in addition to sort of like the feeling of a physical mess.

364
00:21:46,692 --> 00:21:50,690
Rym: But there's nothing you can do about that and I don't move, you know where?

365
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:55,430
Rym: I Mean do what Beth did spread out all over the city.

366
00:21:56,334 --> 00:21:57,659
Scott: I sort of like the idea.

367
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:58,824
Scott: I sort of like that.

368
00:21:58,844 --> 00:22:00,290
Scott: They're gonna combine with the New York Comic Con.

369
00:22:00,351 --> 00:22:01,428
Scott: I think that's gonna work well.

370
00:22:01,591 --> 00:22:05,086
Rym: Oh really especially if they do the combined show floor and they put it in the good part of the Javits.

371
00:22:05,126 --> 00:22:10,885
Rym: because if they take All the show flooring stuff out of that downstairs area and just put like the panel rooms down there.

372
00:22:11,407 --> 00:22:12,410
Rym: It'll work a lot better.

373
00:22:12,553 --> 00:22:13,229
Scott: I think so, too.

374
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:21,870
Scott: Also, if you notice when you go to the Javits for like a convention in the upstairs part like some conventions It feels dark like the New York Comic Con actually feels sort of dark, right?

375
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:31,730
Scott: But in the artists alley it actually feels bright and like if you go to the car show It's like the brightness or darkness will vary totally by like which card your company you're next to, you know.

376
00:22:32,331 --> 00:22:40,537
Scott: So it's really all about what you bring to the space and the space itself is really flexible and you just really have to try Hard to make it right.

377
00:22:40,617 --> 00:22:43,087
Rym: Yep, but in the end, I mean why I can't come.

378
00:22:43,107 --> 00:22:47,427
Rym: it's one of those things You can't complain about like yeah, the staff of the BCC or crap for Otakon.

379
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:48,050
Rym: Yeah, what are you gonna do?

380
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:52,314
Rym: you can't get rid of them all that stuff, but The combined one.

381
00:22:52,354 --> 00:22:54,603
Rym: I'm really looking forward to the combined comic-con anime.

382
00:22:54,864 --> 00:22:56,350
Scott: Oh, I'm gonna be there all three days.

383
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,295
Rym: We're gonna stay all three days.

384
00:22:57,315 --> 00:22:58,883
Rym: We're gonna do crazy programming for it.

385
00:22:58,903 --> 00:22:59,747
Rym: Like I'm awesome.

386
00:22:59,827 --> 00:23:00,912
Rym: I'm excited But I am.

387
00:23:00,953 --> 00:23:02,881
Scott: it's like, you know, it's like the New York Comic Con.

388
00:23:02,901 --> 00:23:06,134
Scott: I was like, okay one day New York Anime Festival Okay, one day combine them.

389
00:23:06,174 --> 00:23:07,498
Scott: It's like oh shit.

390
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:10,247
Scott: That is like big level plus, you know.

391
00:23:10,508 --> 00:23:13,761
Rym: all that aside Everyone seemed to be having by and large a really good time.

392
00:23:13,781 --> 00:23:15,990
Rym: Like the kid the show was doing really well.

393
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:16,896
Rym: There were a lot of people there.

394
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:19,010
Rym: Yep, and you know, we did our panel anime.

395
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:19,532
Rym: You should see.

396
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,597
Rym: you know, I'm Saturday night.

397
00:23:20,637 --> 00:23:21,722
Rym: Like that was our big panel at it.

398
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:23,410
Rym: a ton of people came.

399
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:24,676
Rym: There was a gigantic line.

400
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:25,942
Rym: They almost had to clear the room out.

401
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:29,733
Rym: It was like standing room only and It went really great.

402
00:23:29,753 --> 00:23:32,020
Rym: The audience was really cool if a bit unruly.

403
00:23:32,321 --> 00:23:33,304
Rym: seriously people.

404
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:36,617
Scott: Yeah calm the fuck down I think I really think it's.

405
00:23:36,657 --> 00:23:39,170
Scott: you know, we just talked about how I've sort of felt like a children's palace.

406
00:23:39,291 --> 00:23:45,082
Scott: I think the psychology of the space Affects the behavior of the people and sadly very significant way.

407
00:23:45,282 --> 00:23:50,946
Rym: like we have advice like when conventions have problems Usually we know like do this do this to fix it and it usually works.

408
00:23:50,966 --> 00:23:59,380
Scott: to fix this problem You're gonna need like those people who design casinos and shopping malls to like arrange the space in a way that is Psychologically conducive to be.

409
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,753
Rym: I don't know the psychology of it But I do know this.

410
00:24:02,214 --> 00:24:06,830
Rym: anime Boston unlike Otakon is a much more subdued like overall feeling.

411
00:24:06,931 --> 00:24:07,316
Scott: I think it's.

412
00:24:07,356 --> 00:24:13,190
Scott: the building is just brighter No Look and has a mall attached has the same thing and both packs.

413
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:14,997
Rym: Similar buildings are similar buildings.

414
00:24:15,017 --> 00:24:17,908
Rym: They're very vertical as opposed to horizontal and they have malls attached.

415
00:24:18,109 --> 00:24:19,077
Rym: Yep I don't know.

416
00:24:19,138 --> 00:24:28,799
Rym: Maybe there's something there but So things of the day.

417
00:24:28,819 --> 00:24:31,210
Rym: I found this and I just thought it was really cool.

418
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,899
Rym: It's a picture gallery not a video.

419
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:34,870
Rym: for once Oh college humor.

420
00:24:35,831 --> 00:24:42,050
Rym: It is a picture gallery of a scarecrow a scarecrow called the Tin Man and I don't really want to.

421
00:24:43,933 --> 00:24:45,238
Rym: I don't want to spoil it at all.

422
00:24:45,439 --> 00:24:45,640
Rym: I don't?

423
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,544
Rym: I just go look at it.

424
00:24:47,026 --> 00:24:51,641
Rym: It is a creepy Motherfucking scarecrow, let me tell you but I don't know.

425
00:24:51,661 --> 00:24:52,404
Rym: I really like this.

426
00:24:52,504 --> 00:24:53,287
Rym: and the coolest thing.

427
00:24:53,307 --> 00:24:54,733
Rym: at the bottom You'll see the sign.

428
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:55,576
Rym: It's like Tin Man.

429
00:24:55,957 --> 00:24:59,189
Rym: Please do not oil and you'll see why.

430
00:24:59,871 --> 00:25:01,435
Rym: Man, it's pretty cool.

431
00:25:01,495 --> 00:25:01,816
Rym: That's it.

432
00:25:02,117 --> 00:25:06,608
Rym: I mean, I guess I could there's a quote again into the October Halloween season here.

433
00:25:06,688 --> 00:25:11,902
Rym: It is The men were broken wooden buckets metal pails pistols and rifles all empty.

434
00:25:12,404 --> 00:25:14,830
Rym: only a quarter of the original mob remained alive.

435
00:25:14,871 --> 00:25:17,393
Scott: You know Halloween will be the fourth anniversary of GeekNights.

436
00:25:17,855 --> 00:25:21,265
Rym: the Tin Man beta GeekNights was finished half his body.

437
00:25:21,305 --> 00:25:32,764
Rym: now one solid rusted joint Dragged by the other slowing half with a low creaking mode of metal and rusty froze His axe finally at rest above his head a drop of blood the last movement to come from.

438
00:25:32,884 --> 00:25:34,710
Scott: All right, whatever this thing's pretty cool.

439
00:25:35,596 --> 00:25:38,694
Scott: so Yeah, what was my thing today?

440
00:25:38,754 --> 00:25:39,135
Scott: All right.

441
00:25:39,617 --> 00:25:42,165
Scott: It is the Halloween season as I was just mentioning.

442
00:25:42,205 --> 00:25:43,108
Rym: This is Halloween.

443
00:25:43,148 --> 00:25:47,102
Scott: This is Halloween Yes, and angry video game nerd James.

444
00:25:47,483 --> 00:25:48,105
Rym: Oh crap.

445
00:25:48,125 --> 00:25:50,595
Scott: Yeah, he's awesome, dude He does awesome stuff.

446
00:25:50,736 --> 00:26:12,788
Scott: It starts tomorrow and every day in the month of October He is going to do a video just like he did the year before and the year before it is Monster Madness 3 Monster Madness 1. he basically reviewed a horror movie every day in the month of October Monster Madness 2 Movie every day in the month of October and this year, I guess he's going back to horror movies.

447
00:26:12,808 --> 00:26:18,950
Scott: We'll find out Starting tomorrow or I guess today depending on where you listen to this or maybe even a long time ago.

448
00:26:19,171 --> 00:26:20,034
Scott: Anybody listen to this.

449
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:24,692
Scott: October 1st 2009 is the first day of Monster Madness 3.

450
00:26:24,692 --> 00:26:30,430
Scott: James Rolf the angry video game nerd will make a video every single day relating to horror in the month of October.

451
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:40,650
Scott: Whoo All right, one thing I wanted to mention about the nyaf that we didn't mention is that The attendance numbers are actually kind of low.

452
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:45,050
Scott: It's like they put out a number where that's like 20,000 or something like that, right?

453
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:53,330
Scott: But the thing is they're counting the turnstile unlike Otakon who counts, you know, the straight-up people Right, so you divide that number by about three.

454
00:26:53,732 --> 00:27:00,441
Rym: Maybe not three because I know a little bit less than three like two in a fraction Even more or less because I saw a lot of Saturday only bad.

455
00:27:00,462 --> 00:27:04,914
Scott: Yeah, there are a lot of one-day badges, but regardless It's not anywhere near 20,000.

456
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:09,310
Rym: It's like it's hard to say what it is though because it was like crazy crowd.

457
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:14,990
Scott: It was crowded, but it wasn't a very expansive space either, you know in terms of you know floor space.

458
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:29,443
Scott: So how many people were actually there is is difficult to say and you'd have to have them count it But regardless is nowhere near 20,000 Yep, and the thing is I just want to say I'm really surprised that you know There's a lot of industry announcements at the New York Anime Festival.

459
00:27:29,503 --> 00:27:37,210
Scott: compared to other cons like it's sort of become You know, it's like Anime Expo and New York Anime Festival is where the remaining anime manga industry makes its announcements.

460
00:27:37,411 --> 00:27:38,293
Rym: I'm really interested.

461
00:27:38,313 --> 00:27:41,061
Scott: Yeah, it's a relatively small con.

462
00:27:41,182 --> 00:27:43,810
Rym: I'm really interested to know why not Otakon, right?

463
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:48,604
Scott: I think it's because Otakon is eschewing the industry or what's left of it.

464
00:27:49,206 --> 00:27:50,210
Rym: I don't know if they are though.

465
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:54,574
Rym: I mean, I don't have a lot of insight, you know, we've theoretically joined the Otakon staff But I still don't know anything about.

466
00:27:54,815 --> 00:28:00,367
Rym: apparently Otakon doesn't really start any planning or anything big until after the you know First of the year in other words until it's too late.

467
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:08,224
Rym: It's just kind of weird, you know We're trying to get stuff ready for Otakon and yet like we've already scheduled some panels for Kinetic Con.

468
00:28:08,525 --> 00:28:09,027
Scott: I know right?

469
00:28:09,047 --> 00:28:15,295
Rym: Oh Well, so I've seen I don't know Eska Flonay Three and a half times.

470
00:28:15,857 --> 00:28:17,684
Rym: I've watched Cowboy Bebop three times.

471
00:28:17,844 --> 00:28:19,330
Rym: I've seen Utena four times.

472
00:28:20,411 --> 00:28:23,825
Rym: I'm gonna watch ghost in the cell chandelier standalone complex a second time.

473
00:28:23,845 --> 00:28:26,256
Scott: I Don't even know I could die.

474
00:28:26,357 --> 00:28:27,904
Scott: I'd be here all night trying to figure out.

475
00:28:27,945 --> 00:28:29,050
Rym: we've seen Trigon twice.

476
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:31,399
Rym: I've seen beautiful dreamer like seven times.

477
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,170
Scott: Yeah, I've seen a lot of things a lot more than one.

478
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,635
Rym: Take the gas station.

479
00:28:36,655 --> 00:28:40,748
Scott: I've read the Akira manga like three or four times Star Wars.

480
00:28:40,909 --> 00:28:40,969
Scott: it.

481
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:43,741
Scott: I've realized I forgot the meta moment.

482
00:28:43,881 --> 00:28:49,339
Rym: Oh, well, I've realized with all the Media I consume with anime more so than anything.

483
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:50,864
Rym: There's this rewatching happening.

484
00:28:51,164 --> 00:28:58,370
Rym: Yeah, I mean I reread books But not nearly with the frequency that I rewatch anime and it's almost like it becomes this ritual.

485
00:28:58,613 --> 00:29:00,210
Rym: It's not just us a lot of people.

486
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:06,480
Rym: I remember I was having a discussion with someone in the crew and they said something like yeah It's about that time to watch Eska Flonay again.

487
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:11,707
Scott: Yeah, I Replay some video games like I played Zelda 1. how many times?

488
00:29:11,848 --> 00:29:21,690
Scott: Yep So we were thinking about it and we tried to figure and let's do a show on it, I guess yeah I mean like why is it the first of all, you know, there's a few questions that to answer here.

489
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:26,330
Scott: Why are we rewatching anime, you know, why are we doing it?

490
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:30,224
Scott: You know if we're doing it more so than we are for other mediums of entertainment.

491
00:29:30,385 --> 00:29:31,550
Scott: What's the reason for that?

492
00:29:32,151 --> 00:29:33,581
Scott: Should you even rewatch anime?

493
00:29:33,642 --> 00:29:34,690
Scott: Is that a waste of time?

494
00:29:35,411 --> 00:29:36,093
Scott: You know, what?

495
00:29:36,214 --> 00:29:36,515
Scott: why?

496
00:29:36,635 --> 00:29:38,120
Scott: why do you enjoy rewatching it?

497
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:43,298
Scott: Like if you know what's gonna happen already, it's like you already seen it Double dip it when I think about it.

498
00:29:43,378 --> 00:29:48,137
Rym: It's really just the TV shows because we're watching a movie whatever I mean that happens every watched movies a lot.

499
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,530
Rym: So if I'm saying whatever it's not like it's not as novel of a thing.

500
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:54,461
Rym: But how many TV shows do you watch?

501
00:29:54,482 --> 00:30:01,105
Rym: Maybe it's just that anime is the only place where there are Really these kind of story in a TV show from start to finish.

502
00:30:01,587 --> 00:30:02,350
Scott: Yeah, I think it's good.

503
00:30:02,471 --> 00:30:03,817
Scott: It's not only that start to finish.

504
00:30:03,897 --> 00:30:06,730
Scott: It's that it's you know, usually not incredibly long.

505
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:12,339
Scott: I mean, you're not gonna rewatch all of Dragon Ball Z. Well, maybe some people will but most people won't.

506
00:30:12,841 --> 00:30:20,386
Scott: but you can rewatch like a 26 episode TV series as a beginning middle and an end, you know, and it's sort of like the same.

507
00:30:20,406 --> 00:30:21,450
Scott: mean you rewatch Star Wars.

508
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:25,750
Scott: You don't even think of that, you know, it's just rewatch Star Wars whatever cuz it's you know a couple hours.

509
00:30:26,771 --> 00:30:28,758
Scott: But it's sort of like rewatching an anime.

510
00:30:28,818 --> 00:30:29,641
Scott: It's sort of in between.

511
00:30:29,681 --> 00:30:31,729
Scott: It's like it's it's there's an.

512
00:30:31,749 --> 00:30:34,981
Scott: it's Difficult enough that it feels like rewatching.

513
00:30:35,021 --> 00:30:36,930
Scott: It feels like a significant activity.

514
00:30:37,612 --> 00:30:54,320
Scott: But then again, it's not so daunting and large like rereading a long difficult book or rewatch or you know Something or rewatching like a gigantic TV series, you know rewatching a 26 or 13 episode series Isn't big enough that you're not gonna do it.

515
00:30:54,501 --> 00:30:56,249
Rym: I mean what at most 12 hours or so.

516
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:57,128
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

517
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:03,370
Scott: So it's like you're gonna do it because it's not so big but doing it is more than just watching a movie.

518
00:31:03,852 --> 00:31:05,919
Scott: So it feels it feels big.

519
00:31:06,019 --> 00:31:15,690
Scott: so it's it's like of note when you and you don't know dad You know how many times you watch Star Wars But you note how many times you rewatch cow Viva because it's it's it takes you a while.

520
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:16,835
Rym: Well, I think really it's almost.

521
00:31:17,377 --> 00:31:22,290
Rym: it's partly has to do with the format and notice how we only obviously Rewatch the good stuff.

522
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:33,480
Rym: but really when you look at it, you know, the only shows that get rewatched in their entirety are the ones that are a Succinct story like a story that is compact.

523
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,663
Rym: There isn't really filler.

524
00:31:35,004 --> 00:31:36,107
Rym: It's just a really long movie.

525
00:31:36,148 --> 00:31:36,248
Rym: Yep,

526
00:31:36,468 --> 00:31:54,450
Scott: and The other thing about rewatching right is that it's like you Get more the second time around, you know If it's a good thing like when you read a book if you read the book the second time if it's a good book There's always gonna be stuff that you see in the next go-around even comic books like Watchmen.

527
00:31:54,811 --> 00:31:58,824
Scott: Watchmen is the perfect example of when you reread and reread and reread.

528
00:31:58,844 --> 00:32:00,610
Scott: There's just more and more every single time.

529
00:32:01,012 --> 00:32:03,689
Scott: So when you have a good anime series, right?

530
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:11,190
Scott: Let's say you have a good movie like Star Wars you watch it again and again and there's more every single time But there's only like an hour or two of material.

531
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:17,788
Rym: So eventually like I know everything that however, however, the last time I watched Star Wars, which wasn't that long ago.

532
00:32:17,808 --> 00:32:26,857
Rym: I noticed something I'd never noticed before and remember we were sitting there and we realized how great of an actor obi-wan Kenobi was when he Just raises that eyebrow so subtly.

533
00:32:26,877 --> 00:32:28,383
Rym: Yeah, that's mention of Luke's father.

534
00:32:28,403 --> 00:32:30,290
Rym: Yeah, and I just never caught that before.

535
00:32:30,912 --> 00:32:32,258
Rym: The subtlety of his acting.

536
00:32:32,318 --> 00:32:32,820
Scott: that was a good.

537
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,547
Scott: I thought I was like really what did we notice?

538
00:32:34,587 --> 00:32:35,330
Scott: and you said the eyebrow?

539
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:41,674
Scott: I was like, oh, yeah, we didn't notice the ever but anyway, yeah, but when you rewatch something like how to be Bob It's so big.

540
00:32:41,774 --> 00:32:46,128
Scott: It's you know, like 13 hours big that you are going to.

541
00:32:46,229 --> 00:32:56,909
Scott: you know Re-watching you're gonna dig up you're gonna be able to dig up stuff over and over and over and even if you watch it ten Times you'll still be digging up stuff just because it's such a bigger field to dig in.

542
00:32:56,929 --> 00:32:58,295
Rym: one Look at cowboy bebop.

543
00:32:58,757 --> 00:33:08,050
Rym: It is paced such that if you watch it It never like it is as plot and comedy and action dense as a movie.

544
00:33:08,672 --> 00:33:10,998
Rym: The entire series just non-stop great.

545
00:33:11,018 --> 00:33:14,247
Rym: There's no like lol no middle filler episodes.

546
00:33:14,307 --> 00:33:14,648
Rym: Nothing.

547
00:33:15,049 --> 00:33:20,330
Rym: So Think about the intensity of watching Star Wars like the kind of the build-up and everything all the way through.

548
00:33:20,852 --> 00:33:23,179
Rym: You get that for the entirety of a show like cowboy bebop.

549
00:33:23,661 --> 00:33:24,463
Scott: Yeah, it's also.

550
00:33:24,564 --> 00:33:27,898
Scott: you don't have to watch the whole thing at once You don't have to do a marathon.

551
00:33:27,978 --> 00:33:33,810
Scott: You can do the one episode at a time Like I had seen Robo tech when it was on Cartoon Network, right?

552
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:38,619
Scott: but then I got the Matt cross box set that I pre-ordered and You know for $300 way back in the day.

553
00:33:38,639 --> 00:33:44,428
Scott: if you you know If you didn't pay $300 for your original Matt cross box set you didn't buy the right one.

554
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:44,970
Scott: You're not cool.

555
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:55,009
Scott: I Met a guy in New York and a festival who bought that same set and paid the same amount of money and pre-ordered like two Years in advance just like me and I was like, yeah real macro.

556
00:33:55,029 --> 00:34:05,710
Scott: Yeah so Yeah, I when I was at RIT I watched it one episode a day until it was over and I think I'm gonna rewatch it again soon one episode a day.

557
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:08,370
Scott: Cuz he can't watch 50 something episodes all at once.

558
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:09,273
Scott: It's just the same time.

559
00:34:09,293 --> 00:34:09,655
Rym: Look at that.

560
00:34:09,695 --> 00:34:11,542
Rym: that does that break a little bit with?

561
00:34:11,562 --> 00:34:13,449
Rym: you know, that's a very long show.

562
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:15,822
Rym: It's very drawn out that long.

563
00:34:16,045 --> 00:34:16,989
Rym: It's still pretty long.

564
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:20,042
Scott: I watched an RIT like a quarter or less than a quarter even.

565
00:34:20,603 --> 00:34:21,969
Rym: well, how about go to the extreme?

566
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:24,136
Rym: Are you gonna rewatch Galaxy Express 39?

567
00:34:24,136 --> 00:34:25,841
Scott: That's a hundred and seventeen episodes.

568
00:34:25,922 --> 00:34:28,530
Scott: probably not but I will rewatch the movies a bunch of times.

569
00:34:28,772 --> 00:34:40,286
Rym: Well, I noticed it's weird If a show gets beyond a certain length you do the sort of selective rewatch like I watched all of Sailor Moon once I've seen Every single episode of Sailor Moon which I point out is longer than Galaxy Express.

570
00:34:40,728 --> 00:34:42,636
Scott: Wow 200 episodes damn.

571
00:34:43,158 --> 00:34:46,330
Rym: and for movies not too much in Amish on Natsuko.

572
00:34:46,731 --> 00:34:47,913
Scott: Well, I mean, I'm not.

573
00:34:47,973 --> 00:34:51,418
Scott: I'm only talking about the original Galaxy Express 70s 80s TV series.

574
00:34:51,438 --> 00:34:56,022
Scott: I'm not talking about Galaxy railways or any of those.

575
00:34:56,342 --> 00:34:57,850
Rym: the entire Legimashimoto verse.

576
00:34:58,392 --> 00:34:59,597
Scott: Yeah, but is that?

577
00:34:59,617 --> 00:35:00,762
Scott: where's the Sailor Moon verse?

578
00:35:00,842 --> 00:35:02,388
Scott: it ends with those 200 something episodes.

579
00:35:02,429 --> 00:35:03,693
Scott: That's it I did watch.

580
00:35:03,733 --> 00:35:04,535
Scott: remember that Sailor Moon.

581
00:35:04,575 --> 00:35:05,839
Scott: you're saying it's 200 episodes.

582
00:35:05,879 --> 00:35:09,790
Scott: It's actually Sailor Moon Sailor Stars Sailor, whatever.

583
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:20,170
Rym: As super s are Sailor Moon are one thing I can say those I I rewatched it, but I skipped most of it.

584
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:24,470
Rym: I basically watched like the 20 like episodes that matter in great.

585
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:27,570
Scott: That's like watching the six that the cow would be about the episodes that are the real plot.

586
00:35:27,771 --> 00:35:30,530
Rym: But even with a good show like I'm not gonna watch all of master Keaton again.

587
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:32,036
Rym: I got everything out of master Keaton.

588
00:35:32,056 --> 00:35:34,666
Scott: I've seen all of my stuff to watch master Keaton one time.

589
00:35:35,148 --> 00:35:35,650
Rym: Oh my god.

590
00:35:36,451 --> 00:35:39,539
Rym: Yeah, but I will watch certain.

591
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:43,210
Rym: I've know like I remember showing people and this is actually a big part of rewatching.

592
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:51,850
Rym: It's not so much necessarily watching it yourself But there's a certain joy in watching someone else who has not yet watched a show watch it.

593
00:35:51,951 --> 00:35:53,590
Scott: Well, that's what I did with Gundam seed, right?

594
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:59,284
Scott: I had watched all of Gundam seen on my own and then I watched it again with like Riven Emily and it was like Oh snaps.

595
00:35:59,325 --> 00:36:03,744
Scott: Yep And it really helped that I had forgotten pretty much a lot of what happened.

596
00:36:03,764 --> 00:36:04,546
Scott: like especially like.

597
00:36:04,948 --> 00:36:08,930
Scott: I knew the ending There was like the giant thing, but I forgot like the details.

598
00:36:09,312 --> 00:36:12,850
Scott: It's like all right, though that dude gets killed like this and yada yada.

599
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:14,315
Rym: It was like the whole thing at the end.

600
00:36:14,356 --> 00:36:23,127
Rym: not no spoiler here, but it's just some guy who does it I know right that made the entire series really forgot that like, you know entirely.

601
00:36:23,187 --> 00:36:26,117
Scott: so when I saw it again It was still oh snap It wasn't even just me and Emily.

602
00:36:26,157 --> 00:36:28,026
Rym: a lot of it was just you and me and you'd seen it all.

603
00:36:28,067 --> 00:36:39,490
Scott: you did not watch Every episode with me while I watched it but like you came in and watched like I remember watching every episode I'm pretty sure I think I skipped the recap episodes that I knew were recap episodes like with Emily.

604
00:36:39,571 --> 00:36:46,610
Rym: She watched some of it without me But like I was there watching her watch all the like big episodes namely all the ones with the different music plays.

605
00:36:46,911 --> 00:36:47,795
Rym: Yes, the good.

606
00:36:47,855 --> 00:36:48,378
Rym: Oh my god.

607
00:36:48,398 --> 00:36:49,724
Rym: the Opera House or on the island.

608
00:36:49,764 --> 00:36:50,950
Scott: It's like attack the gas station.

609
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:55,790
Scott: We've seen it so many times not because we it's you know, so so great.

610
00:36:55,891 --> 00:36:57,038
Scott: I mean, it's great, but it's not so.

611
00:36:57,078 --> 00:36:58,810
Rym: so I wouldn't just like watch it right now.

612
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:06,020
Scott: But we watch attack the gas station because whenever there's someone who hasn't seen it already So we can a indoctrinate them into our inside attack the gas.

613
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:14,723
Rym: It is difficult to impress upon you all of you listeners out there how Important to front row culture attack the gas station is.

614
00:37:14,763 --> 00:37:16,730
Rym: like every inside joke is from that movie, right?

615
00:37:17,391 --> 00:37:18,113
Scott: And we got it.

616
00:37:18,274 --> 00:37:22,387
Scott: So it's to indoctrinate them into the inside jokes, but it's also just a watch.

617
00:37:22,648 --> 00:37:23,491
Scott: and you know It's like.

618
00:37:23,651 --> 00:37:28,400
Scott: I don't know why it is that people are like, why do we enjoy watching other people?

619
00:37:29,181 --> 00:37:33,604
Scott: Laugh at something that we no longer find funny, but once found funny I think there's is.

620
00:37:33,624 --> 00:37:36,093
Scott: it's like prove to ourselves that yes, it was funny.

621
00:37:36,194 --> 00:37:37,177
Scott: I wasn't just stupid.

622
00:37:37,238 --> 00:37:37,880
Scott: There are two aspects.

623
00:37:40,082 --> 00:37:41,915
Rym: All I can think about now is cooking master pot.

624
00:37:42,056 --> 00:37:44,107
Scott: Yeah Perfect example of that.

625
00:37:44,127 --> 00:37:47,180
Scott: and you know, it's like we saw that geeky got here and it was so awesome.

626
00:37:47,501 --> 00:37:55,060
Scott: So it's like now you just want to see someone else like discover that get he got to your awesomeness that you know Oh my god when assumes them on his eye, but no there are two aspects.

627
00:37:59,221 --> 00:38:10,636
Rym: That's right, but aspect the first Is that when you watch someone else watch it you already know what's going to happen.

628
00:38:10,696 --> 00:38:21,175
Rym: so you have this kind of anticipation of the moment and you get excited like oh Man, the totally awesome thing that comes out of nowhere is about to come out of nowhere and they don't know.

629
00:38:21,255 --> 00:38:25,690
Scott: it's coming in many ways Isn't it like telling someone about your D&D character?

630
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:27,276
Rym: in a way, but you're not.

631
00:38:27,497 --> 00:38:30,386
Scott: it's almost as though Showing them your D&D character.

632
00:38:30,426 --> 00:38:37,548
Rym: No, your D&D character is real and is doing the cool thing again And you're just watching someone else.

633
00:38:37,588 --> 00:38:38,090
Rym: Enjoy it.

634
00:38:38,311 --> 00:38:40,560
Rym: Yeah, but to the second aspect.

635
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:48,319
Scott: This is why I like sort of you know want to do more showings at conventions because like you show someone awesome stuff You know and then you see them laugh at it.

636
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,400
Scott: It's like nothing you show like the daikon.

637
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,534
Rym: Nothing has done that more for me than a kinetic.

638
00:38:53,674 --> 00:38:53,795
Rym: on.

639
00:38:53,835 --> 00:39:02,748
Rym: and then the New York Anime Festival We showed people the daikon animation after explaining just what the big deal was and It's so inspiring to like watch it in one.

640
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:04,314
Rym: I'm inspired just watching it.

641
00:39:04,354 --> 00:39:07,689
Rym: like every time every single time You just get this feeling in your heart.

642
00:39:07,729 --> 00:39:09,720
Rym: Like wow, what am I doing with my life?

643
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,876
Rym: Look at that and that music and ah that song gets stuck in my head.

644
00:39:12,916 --> 00:39:13,640
Scott: and do the music.

645
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,446
Rym: No, but the music so fits it.

646
00:39:15,526 --> 00:39:22,468
Rym: like they picked the perfect song, but every time we show it to people at a con like They get it you can see they get it.

647
00:39:22,548 --> 00:39:36,316
Rym: and like showing someone one episode of it's all about how you present it to showing one episode of princess tutu to a crowd of people does more than like an hour of talking about princess to show in some DMC some Damaka dobutsu.

648
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:47,115
Rym: No one trusts us on Damaka dobutsu, but then we show it to them and they're like Animals are no good, but the second watch some after the show I can pass the show I can rewatch over and over again.

649
00:39:47,884 --> 00:39:49,160
Scott: Not maybe not over and over again.

650
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,770
Rym: But partly it's that it's that there's so little commitment.

651
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:56,109
Rym: cuz it's your short and partly again cuz only when I'm showing it to Other people, you know, it's you know, it's weird.

652
00:39:56,129 --> 00:39:58,360
Scott: It's like whenever there's a new anime, right?

653
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:02,133
Scott: I'll end up watching like the first episode a ton of times right.

654
00:40:02,294 --> 00:40:04,000
Scott: isn't that it happens to me with so many shows?

655
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:06,340
Rym: I think it's partly because we have such a wide friend group.

656
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:11,646
Scott: It's like I've seen like if you like there are some shows where I've only seen the first episode But I've seen it like five times.

657
00:40:12,128 --> 00:40:13,996
Scott: just cuz I keep showing it to people.

658
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:15,000
Rym: it's because of our friend group.

659
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:17,771
Rym: We have such a large friend group nearby and we don't.

660
00:40:17,791 --> 00:40:24,599
Rym: we all get together different parts at different times And if some show like we think it's awesome We're gonna want to get all the other people into it.

661
00:40:24,961 --> 00:40:27,470
Rym: So we keep showing the first episode all these different groups of people.

662
00:40:27,811 --> 00:40:31,466
Scott: Yeah, and it's like I know I'd be later episodes I barely even remember.

663
00:40:31,526 --> 00:40:31,887
Scott: It's like you.

664
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:33,354
Scott: you show me a show.

665
00:40:33,374 --> 00:40:34,900
Scott: It's like I'll remember the first episode.

666
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,228
Scott: I won't remember any of the later episodes at all.

667
00:40:37,288 --> 00:40:38,392
Scott: Maybe I'll remember the ending.

668
00:40:38,613 --> 00:40:42,083
Rym: it creates this weird situation though to where I'll almost Watch it.

669
00:40:42,163 --> 00:40:46,940
Rym: so because then I'll remember it as I rewatch, but I'll be like tired of a show like I've like cowboy bebop.

670
00:40:47,342 --> 00:40:50,460
Rym: I saw the first five episodes like a bajillion times.

671
00:40:51,261 --> 00:40:54,720
Rym: A bajillion is to the point that when I watch the first five episodes.

672
00:40:55,141 --> 00:40:57,488
Rym: I can almost feel impatient like am I doing this?

673
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:00,979
Rym: but then I see episode six is like, oh right this show shit.

674
00:41:01,099 --> 00:41:09,493
Scott: Awesome Yep, but the second aspect that I keep doing even jelly and I've seen the first episode of evangelical like ten times But I've seen evangelical like two or three times.

675
00:41:09,513 --> 00:41:10,419
Rym: I want to talk about Ava separate.

676
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:12,380
Rym: I have a whole thing to say about Ava and rewatching.

677
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:22,180
Rym: Yeah But the second aspect is the you can't ever see a show again Unless you have memory problems the first time you see cowboy bebop.

678
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:29,864
Rym: There's that feeling when the show ends and you've seen it all that that there's that that sense that you can only get once from any experience.

679
00:41:30,407 --> 00:41:38,780
Rym: but while you can never ever reclaim that Watching someone else have the same experience lets you almost vicariously through them relive it just a little bit.

680
00:41:39,081 --> 00:41:41,486
Rym: You get a little bit of that glimmer of what it was like to see.

681
00:41:41,506 --> 00:41:45,816
Scott: you're basically using other people to To channel your nostalgia.

682
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:50,922
Rym: Yes I remember when we showed Pete all of cowboy bebop because he hadn't seen it and Watch.

683
00:41:51,023 --> 00:41:52,714
Rym: I didn't even look at the screen.

684
00:41:52,755 --> 00:41:58,215
Rym: during the end I watched Pete and I relived that feeling just by seeing him go.

685
00:41:58,235 --> 00:42:03,736
Rym: Whoa Yeah, like at the end he literally he sat there and the credits roll.

686
00:42:03,776 --> 00:42:07,661
Rym: at the end he just goes Was it Alex or Pete?

687
00:42:07,681 --> 00:42:12,259
Rym: I don't remember might have been Alex But that's that's another thing about rewatching.

688
00:42:12,299 --> 00:42:14,930
Rym: is that especially, you know separately the whole topic of marathoning?

689
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,619
Rym: It can come out of nowhere.

690
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:22,323
Rym: that time whether it was Pete or Alex We did not intend to watch all of cowboy bebop.

691
00:42:22,664 --> 00:42:24,110
Rym: I did not intend to watch any of it.

692
00:42:24,351 --> 00:42:25,174
Rym: He was just over.

693
00:42:25,275 --> 00:42:27,665
Rym: we'd moved back into our IT like no one else was around.

694
00:42:27,686 --> 00:42:28,690
Rym: So we're like here.

695
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:29,694
Rym: We'll put on cowboy bebop.

696
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:31,261
Scott: The TV was still on the opposite wall.

697
00:42:31,422 --> 00:42:32,627
Scott: Yeah on the left.

698
00:42:32,767 --> 00:42:39,329
Rym: Yeah weird we're like you watch this while we like, you know clean the apartment up and move back in and do all our stuff.

699
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:41,640
Rym: and You know, he turns it on.

700
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:58,227
Rym: in the first couple episodes plan I keep like walking into the room like watching all the good scenes while he's watching them and We just kind of kept watching and then after about ten episodes Me him and Scott are just sitting in the room like watching every episode in order without stopping and then the whole show was done And we there was nothing we could have done to prevent that from happening.

701
00:42:58,529 --> 00:43:01,238
Rym: Nope And it's the same thing with some shows.

702
00:43:01,298 --> 00:43:10,249
Rym: force you like eska flown a. you better be ready to marathon that whole show If you watch one episode, yep, any of those cliffhanger II shows Gundam seed kind of does that too?

703
00:43:11,073 --> 00:43:18,728
Rym: They break it up with the recap episodes and things But towards the end you get those episodes every episode ends and you just you're gonna kill someone if you don't watch the next one.

704
00:43:20,952 --> 00:43:24,890
Rym: It can force you into the show is just making me want to rewatch all the great shows.

705
00:43:25,291 --> 00:43:28,001
Scott: Yeah, the thing is it's like I can't be rewatching the stuff.

706
00:43:28,041 --> 00:43:29,245
Scott: I got new stuff to do.

707
00:43:29,426 --> 00:43:34,478
Rym: but at the same time I Think a lot, you know I've seen like eska flown a and cut like.

708
00:43:34,518 --> 00:43:41,083
Rym: I've seen like this set of like 15 different anime a bunch of times and they happen to be some of the anime I respect the most.

709
00:43:41,123 --> 00:43:46,859
Rym: I think are the greatest the best the most worthwhile and I'll sometimes give myself the argument that Rym.

710
00:43:46,879 --> 00:43:47,642
Rym: you only like these shows.

711
00:43:47,662 --> 00:43:50,031
Rym: you've seen them a million times and you're like partial to Them.

712
00:43:50,313 --> 00:43:53,650
Rym: you keep rewatching them and it's all just bias and nostalgia.

713
00:43:54,551 --> 00:44:05,419
Rym: But and this brings back the Ava point we watched Evangelion again recently and all it did was remind me that no Objectively and independently of all the rewatching is everything.

714
00:44:05,921 --> 00:44:08,530
Rym: The reason I keep rewatching these shows is because they're brilliant.

715
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:10,436
Rym: It's the same reason I keep rereading Hamlet.

716
00:44:10,777 --> 00:44:12,222
Rym: It's just it's brilliant.

717
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:13,707
Rym: Evangelion is a brilliant.

718
00:44:13,887 --> 00:44:16,115
Scott: It's like I you know And it wasn't biased right?

719
00:44:16,176 --> 00:44:16,497
Scott: It's like.

720
00:44:16,597 --> 00:44:17,240
Scott: I watched it.

721
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:17,782
Scott: I liked it.

722
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:20,453
Scott: when I watched it then over time I doubted.

723
00:44:20,955 --> 00:44:33,382
Scott: I doubted that it was as great as I remembered and I was you know I was sort of approaching it with sort of like, you know Oh this time I'm gonna watch it again and all these years later and I'm gonna see why everyone's complaining about it.

724
00:44:33,884 --> 00:44:38,200
Scott: and then I watched like two episodes and I'm like Everyone's a moron is the best thing ever right?

725
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:44,803
Scott: So even when I approached it with the negative attitude You know, I saw it for what it really was and you know.

726
00:44:44,823 --> 00:44:47,995
Scott: that proves that you know people say Oh, you didn't want to like it.

727
00:44:48,055 --> 00:44:49,802
Scott: So you weren't gonna after you wash it.

728
00:44:49,822 --> 00:44:52,050
Scott: Well, no, look here's the counter example.

729
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:55,140
Scott: I I thought it was gonna be bad and it wasn't.

730
00:44:55,501 --> 00:45:02,070
Scott: and so rewatching allowed me to you know Refresh and you don't remember the truth that I had forgotten.

731
00:45:04,552 --> 00:45:09,208
Rym: I just want to rewatch all these shows But it also you know kind of not enough hours in the day.

732
00:45:09,288 --> 00:45:12,723
Rym: to me It comes back to the whole like the anime industry because I look at every.

733
00:45:12,743 --> 00:45:14,370
Scott: take a day off of work and we didn't sleep.

734
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:21,614
Scott: There's 20. we could get over 24 hours in I think and you could rewatch a show and maybe nine hours of 26.

735
00:45:21,614 --> 00:45:23,889
Scott: We could probably watch three whole shows.

736
00:45:24,914 --> 00:45:30,814
Scott: We could probably at least watch kawaii bop and Evangelion definitely with night Day off work.

737
00:45:30,934 --> 00:45:39,027
Rym: would we just watch like 12 hours of anime with like a group of people too often Oh my god, not often enough.

738
00:45:39,873 --> 00:45:44,655
Rym: back when time was our one of our most We had more time than we had.

739
00:45:44,735 --> 00:45:45,076
Rym: anything.

740
00:45:45,237 --> 00:45:45,638
Rym: that's right.

741
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:48,148
Rym: time was like the biggest resource we had.

742
00:45:48,168 --> 00:45:48,750
Rym: we could waste it.

743
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:49,393
Rym: However, we wanted.

744
00:45:49,875 --> 00:45:50,136
Rym: now.

745
00:45:50,217 --> 00:45:52,266
Rym: time is precious like hamburgers.

746
00:45:52,548 --> 00:45:52,688
Scott: Mr.

747
00:45:52,729 --> 00:45:53,010
Scott: Cherish.

748
00:45:57,314 --> 00:46:00,235
Rym: But it's not just that it's on a more You know general scale.

749
00:46:00,697 --> 00:46:03,990
Rym: look at the great shows the shows that are great or the shows that stand the test of time.

750
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:09,510
Rym: I mean Galaxy Express is still a relevant and good show today that you know.

751
00:46:09,671 --> 00:46:10,657
Rym: Endures the test of time.

752
00:46:10,758 --> 00:46:21,640
Rym: Ava endured the test of time and The lens of time is the only real way to filter the objectively good and the objectively noteworthy From the momentarily awesome.

753
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,350
Rym: I mean Fullmetal Alchemist was totally awesome when I watched it.

754
00:46:24,535 --> 00:46:25,593
Scott: Yeah Like we were like.

755
00:46:25,613 --> 00:46:27,118
Scott: basically you're desperate.

756
00:46:27,198 --> 00:46:30,770
Scott: every time a new episode came out and everyone got together and watched it like that night.

757
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:33,078
Scott: Immediately you're in a big rush to watch it.

758
00:46:33,158 --> 00:46:33,780
Scott: It was huge.

759
00:46:34,262 --> 00:46:35,346
Rym: Everyone was all over it.

760
00:46:35,406 --> 00:46:42,994
Scott: now rewatching that again Now I'm probably never gonna rewatch Fullmetal Alchemist, you know, I mean it's like it was good at the time, but there's no Rewatching action.

761
00:46:43,035 --> 00:46:44,643
Scott: It didn't really have the quality.

762
00:46:44,683 --> 00:46:47,453
Scott: It had this sort of momentary Entertainment value.

763
00:46:47,894 --> 00:46:50,182
Rym: It's a rare show that has the rewatch ability.

764
00:46:50,202 --> 00:46:52,550
Scott: I mean, that's how you know, something is really good.

765
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:54,597
Scott: You can watch Star Wars a hundred times.

766
00:46:54,618 --> 00:46:56,404
Scott: You can watch Indiana Jones a hundred times.

767
00:46:56,444 --> 00:47:02,170
Scott: You can watch I don't know Another great movie a hundred times.

768
00:47:02,872 --> 00:47:04,898
Scott: You can reread Watchmen a hundred times.

769
00:47:04,938 --> 00:47:09,050
Scott: you can rewatch Ava a hundred times, but you can't rewatch Fullmetal Alchemist.

770
00:47:09,271 --> 00:47:10,216
Scott: You can't rewatch.

771
00:47:10,679 --> 00:47:12,630
Rym: I don't know what else but I think that's so great.

772
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:24,710
Rym: That is in the end a big reason why the anime industry and the DVD industry in America really collapsed so much is that All the anime that they seem to be really have pushed and tried to market and get people to watch and out there like it's not

773
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:25,651
Scott: Watchable

774
00:47:25,972 --> 00:47:26,836
Rym: Naruto and all that.

775
00:47:27,197 --> 00:47:30,090
Rym: These are not shows where you're gonna go buy the entire box set.

776
00:47:30,371 --> 00:47:33,490
Rym: It's not like every Naruto fan is gonna buy all of Naruto.

777
00:47:33,691 --> 00:47:38,667
Scott: Yeah, the only people who are gonna buy those things are like collectors and uber fans, right?

778
00:47:38,728 --> 00:47:39,470
Scott: It's like with movies.

779
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:43,030
Scott: There's some people who are like movie buffs and they get like a huge collection of DVDs.

780
00:47:43,692 --> 00:47:49,770
Scott: But most people just buy the DVDs that they're like gonna rewatch a bunch.

781
00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:51,804
Scott: They're really really into.

782
00:47:51,945 --> 00:47:53,854
Rym: look at the anime I own or Scott owns.

783
00:47:53,874 --> 00:47:54,596
Rym: most of the crew own.

784
00:47:54,938 --> 00:47:56,101
Rym: we'd only own anime.

785
00:47:56,141 --> 00:48:02,549
Rym: not even that will rewatch because a lot of anime that I Would rewatch I don't own but that will shut we want to show to other people.

786
00:48:02,569 --> 00:48:07,824
Rym: Yes I only buy anime that I will pointedly be lending to other people like you.

787
00:48:07,844 --> 00:48:09,950
Scott: just let the common bebop to the co-workers today.

788
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:14,988
Rym: Yes with the with the packaged in syphilis, but think about what that does to the anime industry.

789
00:48:15,008 --> 00:48:15,510
Rym: Just look at it.

790
00:48:15,610 --> 00:48:21,850
Rym: Alright, so one people really people are only gonna buy the greatest anime that they're going to show to other people.

791
00:48:22,351 --> 00:48:25,722
Rym: So one dude at the center of a social circle buys cowboy bebop.

792
00:48:26,304 --> 00:48:28,070
Rym: He lends it to everyone else in his group.

793
00:48:29,331 --> 00:48:31,118
Rym: Yep, how they gonna sell DVDs.

794
00:48:31,138 --> 00:48:31,921
Rym: The answer is they're not.

795
00:48:32,142 --> 00:48:33,527
Scott: no they got to do something else.

796
00:48:33,828 --> 00:48:36,134
Rym: Yeah, I Don't know what to do about that.

797
00:48:36,154 --> 00:48:37,038
Rym: There's no way back.

798
00:48:37,078 --> 00:48:39,127
Rym: It's not like I'm gonna not lend animated people.

799
00:48:39,147 --> 00:48:41,031
Rym: Yeah, I Got it.

800
00:48:41,071 --> 00:48:42,014
Rym: That's quite a hiccup there.

801
00:48:42,034 --> 00:48:43,358
Scott: That was a big one.

802
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:46,649
Scott: Yeah, I wish I could not redo the hiccups every time.

803
00:48:48,351 --> 00:48:50,221
Scott: So you want to end the show before my hiccups take it over?

804
00:48:50,361 --> 00:48:53,311
Rym: Yeah, we should probably just end but I Don't know.

805
00:48:53,371 --> 00:49:06,656
Rym: I don't want to go through a list of anime every watch but I have a really like striking example because I always used to say, you know, like shoujo kakame utenna is my like pretty much one of my favorite anime ever But really like my favorite

806
00:49:06,696 --> 00:49:08,461
Scott: only watch that all the way through once.

807
00:49:08,782 --> 00:49:11,350
Rym: I've seen it all the way through four times that show.

808
00:49:11,952 --> 00:49:13,520
Rym: Every time you watch it, you notice something.

809
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:14,223
Rym: That's a watchman.

810
00:49:14,264 --> 00:49:15,489
Scott: I'll have to watch it again again.

811
00:49:16,372 --> 00:49:16,662
Rym: Yeah

812
00:49:16,683 --> 00:49:17,251
Scott: soon I think

813
00:49:17,572 --> 00:49:27,880
Rym: because I'm feeling like it's time to watch it again because I just got a bunch of other people to watch it and They're coming back and like oh man when such-and-such happened and all I can think is aw, man I want to watch that again.

814
00:49:27,921 --> 00:49:35,590
Rym: That was so good But irresponsible captain Tyler like I used to always say like that show influenced my life more than any media I had ever consumed.

815
00:49:36,173 --> 00:49:44,627
Rym: but I watched like the first two like VHS tapes subbed and then I watched like spread like I'd only seen maybe 75% of the show.

816
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:53,789
Scott: Yeah, I watched the first four episodes, but then I watched like up to episode maybe nine or ten But I was only barely paying attention and it was a tiny TV.

817
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:55,536
Scott: Yeah, and that's all I ever saw.

818
00:49:55,677 --> 00:50:07,410
Rym: like all that I'd seen like I saw a lot of bad fan subs I watched like one raw episode and Like some of it like someone were just unwatchable or stuff would skip and I wasn't really sure what episodes I'd seen and hadn't.

819
00:50:08,211 --> 00:50:16,269
Rym: But like the show had made such an impression on me and recently, you know I finally just got the DVD box that cuz it was reprinted I didn't have to buy that stupid expensive out of print box.

820
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:18,303
Scott: So you didn't get the tea the movie or the.

821
00:50:18,343 --> 00:50:19,290
Scott: when are there OAVs?

822
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:21,262
Rym: Yeah, the OAVs are really good, but they're easy to get.

823
00:50:21,282 --> 00:50:22,570
Rym: and there's the movie.

824
00:50:22,670 --> 00:50:24,762
Rym: But I I saw I watched that in like a 320 by 200 RM.

825
00:50:26,521 --> 00:50:28,916
Rym: Yeah But the show like.

826
00:50:28,996 --> 00:50:34,050
Rym: I remembered it as being like this life-changing show like this amazing show that I just loved and loved and loved.

827
00:50:34,572 --> 00:50:38,826
Rym: But it'd been so long and I'd seen it in such a shady and dodgy way that I wasn't really.

828
00:50:38,846 --> 00:50:49,547
Rym: I was kind of worried Going into it, you know watching it again especially being older and wiser and seeing How my views of shows like utenna and Ava and hokuto no Ken changed with age and wisdom.

829
00:50:49,568 --> 00:50:53,918
Rym: Yeah But I watching it again and I watch it like halfway through.

830
00:50:53,958 --> 00:50:56,146
Rym: then I watch it again again with Emily cuz.

831
00:50:56,166 --> 00:50:56,788
Rym: she'd never seen it.

832
00:50:56,808 --> 00:51:06,563
Rym: and One there is this one episode that I had never actually seen that was so great Like I don't know how I can't imagine that I hadn't like.

833
00:51:06,603 --> 00:51:10,901
Rym: it's amazing to me that a great episode I'd never seen but to the show was fucking amazing.

834
00:51:11,182 --> 00:51:12,507
Rym: It's so great.

835
00:51:12,788 --> 00:51:14,655
Scott: Yeah rewind I was like I'd stepped in.

836
00:51:14,715 --> 00:51:20,747
Scott: I was like I saw part of an episode and like it all came back to me and I was Like, oh, yeah, this show is freaking amazing.

837
00:51:20,787 --> 00:51:21,790
Scott: I forgot Yeah.

838
00:51:22,171 --> 00:51:37,176
Rym: And the weird thing is I think about how much an influence that show had on me having watched it in such like a poor Format and having missed so much of it I don't know what my life would have been like if I had seen all of the show when I was younger because it probably Would have influenced me even more.

839
00:51:37,216 --> 00:51:37,940
Rym: it is it.

840
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:51,086
Rym: I'll put it this way there are episodes that are basically It looks like Oh Rym is this way because he saw this anime in this episode when he was younger But their episodes I hadn't actually seen.

841
00:51:51,368 --> 00:51:53,957
Rym: yeah It was kind of weird.

842
00:51:53,997 --> 00:51:58,170
Rym: Like it was it was very strange to be watching this but the show is brilliant.

843
00:51:58,511 --> 00:52:08,707
Rym: So watch irresponsible captain Tyler and I guess if you have anime and you feel like rewatching it It's probably because it's great and you should probably get a friend over and just rewatch it.

844
00:52:09,149 --> 00:52:10,334
Scott: Yeah All right, you want to.

845
00:52:10,435 --> 00:52:12,985
Scott: I want to do the meta moment that we forgot the meta minute.

846
00:52:13,166 --> 00:52:15,750
Scott: you met a minute whatever It's metamucil, right?

847
00:52:17,252 --> 00:52:18,278
Scott: The ad contest.

848
00:52:18,459 --> 00:52:20,230
Scott: I think I'm just gonna pick a winner at this point.

849
00:52:20,471 --> 00:52:24,510
Scott: No winner because nobody is entering but I forget the name of the winner.

850
00:52:24,972 --> 00:52:27,624
Scott: So I'm going to go and the next episode.

851
00:52:27,664 --> 00:52:40,700
Scott: I will announce the already selected selected Winner who will receive the full set of Akira manga all six volumes yep, and Also, what other meta do we have?

852
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:41,645
Scott: they don't really have any.

853
00:52:41,725 --> 00:52:42,670
Scott: oh we do have some meta.

854
00:52:42,971 --> 00:52:43,794
Scott: Uh, let's see.

855
00:52:43,954 --> 00:52:48,690
Scott: I'm moving and rims got house house buy-in and who knows what is going on here.

856
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:54,510
Rym: Yeah, there may be in the neck in the coming weeks a short hiatus of GeekNights But yeah, do not fear GeekNights just going nowhere.

857
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:56,275
Rym: And in fact the you know, we're not.

858
00:52:56,295 --> 00:53:01,150
Scott: maybe some service disruptions and then we will return to your regularly scheduled programming.

859
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:06,046
Scott: So if like we miss an episode don't you know coming question us out.

860
00:53:06,107 --> 00:53:08,677
Rym: just I'll say this though We miss the last we're gonna miss some.

861
00:53:08,778 --> 00:53:10,164
Rym: we miss the previous Thursday episode.

862
00:53:10,184 --> 00:53:11,430
Rym: That was just me totally bailing.

863
00:53:11,510 --> 00:53:12,976
Rym: That wasn't any interruptions there.

864
00:53:12,996 --> 00:53:15,185
Scott: We're gonna you know for the next month or two.

865
00:53:15,325 --> 00:53:16,490
Scott: things are gonna be a little shaky.

866
00:53:16,912 --> 00:53:20,730
Scott: We'll still try to get episodes out when we have time, but you know, we can't.

867
00:53:22,653 --> 00:53:25,125
Scott: And then we'll be back to the scheduled programming.

868
00:53:25,165 --> 00:53:35,214
Rym: as soon as everyone is Resettled and I realize especially I feel like around Halloween We should do a kind of state of the podcast show because you know that we've four years since 2005 since October 31st.

869
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:41,710
Scott: It's older than that, but that was the first publicly released episode little-known fact.

870
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:56,650
Rym: The first publicly released episode was actually November 1st or 2nd 2005. we then retroactively like a week later took an episode We'd recorded but not released and put it up for Halloween because we thought it was good enough.

871
00:53:57,394 --> 00:54:02,358
Rym: There are two weeks of shows before that the none of you will ever hear Or maybe they will dun dun dun.

872
00:54:02,458 --> 00:54:05,850
Rym: as I've said in the past they are on the internet if you know where to look.

873
00:54:06,261 --> 00:54:08,529
Rym: Yep Someone found them a while ago.

874
00:54:09,092 --> 00:54:10,236
