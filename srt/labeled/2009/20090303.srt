1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,096
Rym: It's Tuesday, March 3rd, I'm Rym.

2
00:00:12,277 --> 00:00:12,700
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:13,141 --> 00:00:14,226
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:14,286 --> 00:00:17,040
Rym: Tonight, a little bit of Mouseguard and then Quake Live.

5
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,918
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:31,051 --> 00:00:35,030
Rym: As I said this morning about the weather, I tire of this bullshit.

7
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:40,335
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I just, uh... It is so cold.

8
00:00:40,355 --> 00:00:42,463
Rym: I mean, I did the Rochester walk this morning.

9
00:00:42,483 --> 00:00:44,270
Rym: I have not done the Rochester walk in a while.

10
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:46,030
Rym: And I do not want to have to do it again.

11
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,145
Scott: I see the thermometer in my car every morning, and this morning it only said -11C.

12
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:52,241
Scott: And there was another time this year where it was less than that.

13
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:52,643
Scott: It was like -13 or 14C.

14
00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:58,070
Scott: So it wasn't the cold as it's been all year, but it was starting to get warm.

15
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,570
Scott: It was like 40-something degrees for a little while.

16
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:08,670
Scott: So the fact that it got cold again is just like... I'm really not too happy, and I just feel like total shit.

17
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:15,182
Scott: And if it doesn't get spring-sued, I'm just gonna quit and get in a plane, and I'm gonna go buy like a $5,000 house in the desert.

18
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:20,410
Scott: Because, you know, houses are cheap, deserts are warm.

19
00:01:20,972 --> 00:01:22,168
Scott: Why would I stay here?

20
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:24,070
Rym: Just quit your job, live off your savings.

21
00:01:24,911 --> 00:01:37,330
Scott: I could just take all my money and I could afford to live in the desert and pay for only an internet connection and electricity and food and own a little desert house and live there for like quite a few years.

22
00:01:37,714 --> 00:01:38,729
Scott: I feel like maybe I should.

23
00:01:38,931 --> 00:01:41,110
Rym: You could go one step further and just squat somewhere.

24
00:01:41,733 --> 00:01:44,690
Scott: Yeah, but I want to live in a nice desert house.

25
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:46,549
Rym: No, buy a really nice Winnebago.

26
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,610
Scott: Winnebago costs more than a desert shack.

27
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,190
Rym: Fine, buy a really crappy Winnebago.

28
00:01:53,851 --> 00:01:55,229
Scott: Rather, a desert shack is nice.

29
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:56,174
Rym: I don't know.

30
00:01:56,194 --> 00:01:57,044
Rym: It wouldn't be that nice.

31
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:57,449
Rym: Depends.

32
00:01:58,313 --> 00:01:59,162
Scott: I'd make it myself.

33
00:01:59,182 --> 00:01:59,829
Scott: It'd be very nice.

34
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:04,810
Rym: So you're gonna play Quake on that high-latency satellite internet connection?

35
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,157
Scott: No, no, no.

36
00:02:07,197 --> 00:02:10,529
Scott: Because a desert shack is so cheap, I could afford to have a T1 brought out.

37
00:02:12,292 --> 00:02:14,408
Scott: There's telephone pretty much anywhere, so why not?

38
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,530
Scott: I'm not talking about the middle of Death Valley.

39
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:20,022
Scott: I'm talking about that tiny little Nevada town or something.

40
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,429
Scott: Somewhere between Vegas and Reno.

41
00:02:24,571 --> 00:02:35,870
Rym: But not that long ago, we were at the New York Comic-Con and we did a bunch of stuff there and we have a few things still pending from that, but one thing I did was I talked to Luke Crane a bit about the mouse card role-playing game.

42
00:02:37,176 --> 00:02:38,890
Rym: Now, Mouse Guard, we played it a little bit.

43
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:44,670
Rym: We're gonna do a show on it once we've fully grokked all that it is and really pushed it to its limits.

44
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:48,229
Rym: So we're really trying to avoid our commentary on it just yet.

45
00:02:49,691 --> 00:02:57,249
Scott: But yeah, basically, Mouse Guard is a comic book made by David Peterson that I was a huge fan of and had been reading for a very long time.

46
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:02,149
Scott: Luke Crane, you probably know, is the creator of Burning Wheel and I like his RPGs.

47
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:14,787
Scott: And way back, when we did that first Luke Crane interview, right before that interview, like literally one minute before we started that interview, I was sitting in the lobby of, what was that hotel?

48
00:03:16,952 --> 00:03:18,229
Rym: Wherever UberCon was.

49
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:23,649
Scott: Yeah, it was near the Meadowlands in some hotel at UberCon, whatever number it was.

50
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,090
Scott: And it was me, Luke Crane, Drunken Rym, right?

51
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,329
Rym: I wasn't drunk yet.

52
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:33,310
Scott: No, Tor Olavsrud and these guys from Arcana Studio Press.

53
00:03:33,592 --> 00:03:35,670
Scott: And we were sitting there and they were talking.

54
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:39,870
Scott: And once I realized who they were, I was like, oh, because Mouse Guard was brand new back then.

55
00:03:40,051 --> 00:03:42,858
Scott: And Scott and I were not... Makes you realize how old Mouse Guard is.

56
00:03:42,939 --> 00:03:44,830
Scott: It's only in its second series.

57
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:48,130
Rym: We were not yet the epic podcasters that we are.

58
00:03:48,472 --> 00:03:48,849
Scott: No, we're not.

59
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,690
Rym: Basically, we had badgered Luke Crane.

60
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,270
Scott: That's where we left the power supply to the compressor.

61
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,530
Rym: Yeah, the old compressor.

62
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,590
Rym: But we had badgered Luke Crane, this whole con.

63
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,320
Rym: Like, can we interview?

64
00:03:59,361 --> 00:03:59,930
Rym: Can we interview?

65
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:04,510
Rym: And finally, he was like, all right, after the con, you can interview me before I go home.

66
00:04:04,993 --> 00:04:06,910
Scott: No, I think he liked being able to.

67
00:04:07,132 --> 00:04:07,495
Scott: He did.

68
00:04:07,536 --> 00:04:07,819
Rym: He did.

69
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:08,626
Rym: But he was definitely...

70
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:14,390
Scott: And that interview is definitely, you know, he's definitely very pleased with the attention that we have managed to attract for him.

71
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:19,410
Rym: But it was definitely a, we're some punk kids who bothered him to get an interview for something.

72
00:04:20,391 --> 00:04:23,947
Scott: Yeah, but, you know, so that was like the burning empires had just come out.

73
00:04:23,987 --> 00:04:24,510
Scott: then, you know.

74
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:32,749
Scott: And he was talking to the Arcana Studio Press guys and he was like, hey, Mouse Guard RPG, you know, if, you know, if you guys want me to do it, I'll do it.

75
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,879
Scott: And then, you know, sure enough, here it is.

76
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:36,762
Scott: How many years later?

77
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:38,126
Scott: There it is.

78
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:39,029
Scott: Mouse Guard RPG.

79
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,420
Rym: But Luke Crane had quite a bit to say about it.

80
00:04:42,501 --> 00:04:44,450
Rym: I recorded this just at the New York Comic Con.

81
00:04:44,591 --> 00:04:48,449
Rym: So there's some background noise, but I'm pretty sure you can understand what he's got to say.

82
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:49,849
Guest: Hey, Mouse fans.

83
00:04:51,390 --> 00:05:02,410
Guest: Mouse Guard Role Playing Game is a, it's meant to be a simple, instructive role playing game that does not ignore complexity and fighting.

84
00:05:02,972 --> 00:05:09,010
Guest: And the things that we liked about D&D were the things that we ignored about D&D when we played it when we were kids.

85
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:21,770
Guest: The mechanic for the game, I mean, aside from all the color about, you know, what your fur color is and your cloak color and all that cool stuff, the mechanic for the game that really locks it in nice and tight is called nature.

86
00:05:23,372 --> 00:05:29,170
Guest: And your nature determines how mousy you are or how not mousy you are.

87
00:05:29,391 --> 00:05:30,856
Guest: And your nature ranges from zero to seven.

88
00:05:31,317 --> 00:05:34,930
Guest: And the higher your nature is, the better off you are.

89
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,463
Guest: You can power your nature into doing all sorts of things.

90
00:05:37,745 --> 00:05:38,710
Guest: A normal mouse could not.

91
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:43,643
Guest: But if your nature gets too high, you become too mousy, too mouse-like.

92
00:05:43,984 --> 00:05:45,950
Guest: You embody the animal too much, right?

93
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,315
Guest: So you can, you know, the wolf will never catch you.

94
00:05:48,355 --> 00:05:49,338
Guest: You'll always outrun the wolf.

95
00:05:49,719 --> 00:05:54,050
Guest: You know, you'll always dig your burrow better, but you become too mouse-like.

96
00:05:55,415 --> 00:05:56,298
Guest: And so that gets you a trait.

97
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,924
Guest: Basically, your nature hits seven.

98
00:05:58,406 --> 00:05:59,510
Guest: That gets you a crazy mousy trait.

99
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:03,649
Guest: When your nature hits zero, you become too un-mouse-like and you get a trait.

100
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:07,830
Guest: Like, Kelina is the best example, the old dude, you know, the black axe, whatever.

101
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:12,810
Guest: He, at some point in that character's past, he hit nature zero and he retired.

102
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:18,608
Guest: He became un-mouse-like and became kind of, he got the old fur trait, basically, when he hit zero.

103
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,621
Guest: Because he's just like, "Ah, forget it.

104
00:06:20,661 --> 00:06:21,186
Guest: I don't want to do this

105
00:06:21,226 --> 00:06:21,529
Guest: anymore.".

106
00:06:21,751 --> 00:06:22,997
Guest: And that's how he's introduced.

107
00:06:23,017 --> 00:06:24,926
Guest: He's like, "I don't want to be in the mouse guard anymore.

108
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:25,549
Guest: I'm something else

109
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:25,670
Guest: now.".

110
00:06:26,613 --> 00:06:28,907
Guest: And we were like, "Wait, how do we make that into a mechanic in the

111
00:06:28,947 --> 00:06:29,148
Guest: game?".

112
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:33,970
Guest: And Kelina, interestingly enough, isn't a sample character because he's the guy you have to play toward.

113
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,736
Guest: You can't make him at the start.

114
00:06:36,017 --> 00:06:38,750
Guest: You have to gun toward playing him and make that history in play.

115
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,633
Guest: Character creation is questionnaire-based.

116
00:06:40,894 --> 00:06:52,970
Guest: You answer questions about your mouse, you know, where he was born, who his parents were, what they did, what his mentor did in the guard, what skills he picked up in the guard, what skills he picked up on the road in the guard, and any kind of natural talents he has.

117
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:54,658
Guest: And that's pretty much it.

118
00:06:54,678 --> 00:06:55,965
Guest: So that's for your skills.

119
00:06:55,985 --> 00:06:56,850
Guest: And then you do the same thing.

120
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,075
Guest: What traits did your parents have?

121
00:06:58,095 --> 00:06:59,079
Guest: What did you inherit from them?

122
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,625
Guest: What didn't you inherit from them?

123
00:07:00,806 --> 00:07:01,630
Guest: What did you get on your own?

124
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,374
Guest: So it's a questionnaire.

125
00:07:03,495 --> 00:07:08,310
Guest: We try to, like all Burning Wheel games, we try to give you a sense of the history of the character in character creation.

126
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:14,850
Guest: We worked really hard to make sure that the mouse guard game, out of the box, without any effort from the players, plays out the comics.

127
00:07:15,411 --> 00:07:16,673
Guest: Fall and winter, right?

128
00:07:16,714 --> 00:07:24,790
Guest: Where you're scraping and scrapping to survive, you're fighting against insane animals, owls and snakes and badgers.

129
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:33,270
Guest: You're, you know, you're the representatives of this organization on which the safety of all mousekind, you know, rests, right?

130
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:36,123
Guest: And so there's a lot of pressure and, you know, your missions are all high stakes.

131
00:07:36,384 --> 00:07:37,710
Guest: Your life is always on the line.

132
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:42,350
Guest: When you open that book and you start reading that book, you are going to play a mouse guard story, period.

133
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:50,470
Guest: So one of the ways, one of the mechanics that we built into the game, rather, to reinforce the mousiness of it was something called the natural order.

134
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:56,202
Guest: And we have this beautiful little chart that David Peterson, the artist and author, designed for us.

135
00:07:56,603 --> 00:08:08,930
Guest: that shows, you know, all the way from insects and, you know, and mice and snakes and bats and birds and badgers and wolves and foxes and bears and moose, like this great scale chart, which honestly is an homage to Call of Cthulhu.

136
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,570
Guest: Anybody who knows what I'm talking about knows what I'm talking about.

137
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:20,270
Guest: And there's that great chart of, like, you go all the way from, like, Bayaki to men all the way up to Cthulhu and they show you the size comparison.

138
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:24,510
Guest: Well, one of the problems in that, for me, is that Cthulhu just has a set number of hit points.

139
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:29,369
Guest: Yeah, he's got special powers, blah, blah, blah, but he's got hit points, which means he can be dealt with.

140
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:30,872
Guest: Not in mouse guard.

141
00:08:31,112 --> 00:08:38,549
Guest: So you can only affect, like, you can only fight with creatures that are, like, one higher step than you or lower.

142
00:08:39,491 --> 00:08:40,195
Guest: On the natural order.

143
00:08:40,255 --> 00:08:42,525
Guest: So mice can fight with snakes and weasels, right?

144
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:43,650
Guest: And, you know, and have a chance.

145
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:49,570
Guest: But beyond that, you know, foxes and wolves and bears, mice run.

146
00:08:51,171 --> 00:08:52,254
Guest: That's what you do.

147
00:08:52,335 --> 00:08:56,850
Guest: when you fight a fox or a weasel or whatever, or a fox or rather a wolverine, you run.

148
00:08:59,313 --> 00:09:02,604
Guest: And if you want to confront those creatures, you have to use science.

149
00:09:03,005 --> 00:09:04,510
Guest: You have to use warfare, right?

150
00:09:04,831 --> 00:09:06,139
Guest: No stabby stabby for them.

151
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:07,247
Guest: You have to use your smarts.

152
00:09:08,011 --> 00:09:17,570
Guest: So by doing this, by creating this natural order and saying this is how it is and these rules are immutable and unbreakable, you know, we've given shape to the universe.

153
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:25,770
Guest: You know, we've planted the poles of the mouse guard world and said, like, okay, this is how they live and this is what they can deal with and this is what they can.

154
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,382
Guest: And it just, it immediately sets players' wheels spinning.

155
00:09:29,744 --> 00:09:31,310
Guest: It's really, really effective.

156
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,894
Guest: Animals in mouse guard are animals.

157
00:09:34,696 --> 00:09:36,039
Guest: Mice are special, right?

158
00:09:36,781 --> 00:09:38,264
Guest: They have their foil, right?

159
00:09:38,485 --> 00:09:40,730
Guest: You know, mice are special and they have their darker cousin.

160
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:45,550
Guest: They have weasels, which they're not really cousins, but mostelids and rodents are two different things.

161
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,093
Guest: I researched all this.

162
00:09:47,574 --> 00:09:54,130
Guest: Anyway, but so, but you basically have your, you know, you have your protagonist peoples and then you have your antagonist peoples.

163
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,255
Guest: You have your orcs, right?

164
00:09:55,556 --> 00:09:56,199
Guest: Weasels are the orcs.

165
00:09:56,219 --> 00:09:58,670
Guest: So they're also smart, but they're smart for evil.

166
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:02,418
Guest: But everything else in the mouse guard world are animals.

167
00:10:02,619 --> 00:10:03,842
Guest: They don't have any intelligence.

168
00:10:04,122 --> 00:10:06,027
Guest: They don't have any goals, any aims.

169
00:10:06,047 --> 00:10:07,470
Guest: They have no civilization, no society.

170
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:15,109
Guest: And this creates a great sense of horror when you realize that the raccoon doesn't want to talk to you, it wants to eat you.

171
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:19,978
Guest: And there's like no amount of negotiation or communication.

172
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:24,870
Guest: Like, you know, a lot of players want to talk to the raccoons and you can, there's a little talk to animal skill.

173
00:10:25,131 --> 00:10:26,978
Guest: And that's fine because, you know, we're all animals, whatever.

174
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:30,190
Guest: But the raccoons pretty much going like, I talked to David Peterson about this.

175
00:10:30,531 --> 00:10:36,390
Guest: He was like, I was like, all right, if Liam and the snake from fall, if they could talk, what would the snake be saying?

176
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:39,308
Guest: And Dave was like, yeah, pretty much be saying, I'm going to eat you.

177
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:47,270
Guest: So you're like right in the game, the animals don't have stats for negotiation or anything like that.

178
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:50,441
Guest: Animals have their nature and they obey the laws of their nature period.

179
00:10:50,462 --> 00:10:52,590
Guest: And that's that's because they're animals.

180
00:10:53,072 --> 00:10:53,473
Guest: And it's great.

181
00:10:53,895 --> 00:10:57,290
Guest: Weasels are David Peterson's orcs, essentially, for this setting.

182
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,238
Guest: They're the generic bad guys.

183
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:01,670
Guest: But the cool thing is, is that one weasel versus one mouse.

184
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,353
Guest: It's no contest.

185
00:11:03,393 --> 00:11:05,379
Guest: The weasel is a mouse killer, you know.

186
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,610
Guest: And there there's lots of weasels, not as many weasels as mice.

187
00:11:10,271 --> 00:11:14,564
Guest: But there are, you know, they're a genocidal threat to all of mouse kind.

188
00:11:15,025 --> 00:11:16,630
Guest: And so I was OK with them as villains.

189
00:11:16,671 --> 00:11:18,089
Guest: I'm like, OK, these guys are kind of badass.

190
00:11:19,731 --> 00:11:24,629
Guest: So we did a whole like, you know, we started out just about every like weasel we could think of.

191
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,656
Guest: So I think comes to like eight different weasels.

192
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:30,130
Guest: So but they have stats and skills like mice have stats and skills.

193
00:11:31,611 --> 00:11:33,945
Guest: So unlike animals, animals don't have skills, stat skills.

194
00:11:33,966 --> 00:11:34,690
Guest: They just have nature.

195
00:11:35,171 --> 00:11:39,950
Guest: If I if I had my druthers, I would want gamer families to play mouse card.

196
00:11:40,731 --> 00:11:47,450
Guest: I want mom or dad to come home to their seven, eight, nine year old kids and be like, all right, we've been waiting.

197
00:11:47,772 --> 00:11:48,658
Guest: We wait for you to get old enough.

198
00:11:48,678 --> 00:11:50,330
Guest: We've been waiting for a game to be good enough.

199
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:51,033
Guest: And here we go.

200
00:11:51,395 --> 00:11:52,722
Guest: You are going to be role playing gamers.

201
00:11:53,044 --> 00:11:54,210
Guest: That would be my ideal.

202
00:11:54,710 --> 00:12:02,170
Guest: As far as I've played, you know, with kids, burning wheel and mouse guard and whatnot, they've never had any trouble rocking the rules.

203
00:12:02,771 --> 00:12:05,830
Guest: Only people have trouble rocking the rules for mouse guard or hardcore gamers.

204
00:12:12,701 --> 00:12:14,630
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

205
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,600
Rym: We play games a lot.

206
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:23,880
Rym: And the one problem with playing games a lot, like really being into gaming, is that you'll often demystify games for yourself.

207
00:12:24,021 --> 00:12:28,800
Rym: Like I used to be like I used to be very excited when I found glitchy parts of like Simon's Quest.

208
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,876
Rym: Like I find a weird area and I'd be all excited and exploring it.

209
00:12:31,936 --> 00:12:32,740
Rym: It was this crazy thing.

210
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,612
Rym: But now I know exactly why that happens.

211
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,300
Rym: And it's no longer interesting to me.

212
00:12:37,561 --> 00:12:42,540
Scott: I remember one time I think there was a babysitter at my house and I was playing Mega Man two and I was fighting Bubble Man.

213
00:12:42,884 --> 00:12:44,440
Rym: Oh, I remember the Bubble Man story.

214
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:51,860
Scott: And then the door that, you know, I was jumping up to shoot Bubble Man and the door opened and I went backwards and the game totally fucked up.

215
00:12:52,261 --> 00:12:56,400
Scott: So I went back through the door and I was in Bubble Man's room, but everything was screwed up and invisible.

216
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,952
Scott: And I basically messed around in that room to figure out what the fuck.

217
00:13:00,992 --> 00:13:04,020
Scott: I thought I had found some amazing secret for like, you know, a long time.

218
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:04,381
Rym: Yeah.

219
00:13:04,422 --> 00:13:06,400
Rym: Didn't you find like every invisible block?

220
00:13:06,881 --> 00:13:06,981
Scott: Yeah.

221
00:13:07,062 --> 00:13:09,012
Scott: It was just, you know, basically it was just a glitch.

222
00:13:09,072 --> 00:13:10,680
Scott: It wasn't actually some crazy secret.

223
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:16,360
Scott: But, you know, it was a glitch that happened to appear like a secret, sort of like Metroid only in Metroid.

224
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:23,700
Scott: The glitches become secrets because you glitch them so much that you actually get from one place in the map to another place in the map.

225
00:13:23,901 --> 00:13:24,061
Rym: Yeah.

226
00:13:24,101 --> 00:13:28,380
Rym: Of course, more often than not, you just end up somewhere unsavable and then you die.

227
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:28,961
Scott: Yeah.

228
00:13:28,981 --> 00:13:38,520
Scott: Pretty, you know, but people who are good at doing the, you know, the secret, you know, Metroid, you know, glitch jump wall jump tricks, they can pretty much get anywhere they want.

229
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:43,420
Scott: They know where all the spots are and they can like go right to the end of the game and all sorts of shit.

230
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,000
Scott: So.

231
00:13:44,661 --> 00:13:54,600
Rym: But anyway, if you want to talk about demystification to the absolute extreme, right here is a website that diagrams everything you could possibly want to know, not just that.

232
00:13:55,081 --> 00:14:01,860
Rym: It diagrams everything about Pac-Man, the exact logic the ghosts use, exactly how they move every single thing.

233
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,420
Scott: Well, that only applies to the original arcade Pac-Man, right?

234
00:14:05,701 --> 00:14:05,942
Rym: Yes.

235
00:14:05,982 --> 00:14:10,400
Scott: That doesn't apply to like Pac-Man verse or, you know, any other releases.

236
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:11,384
Rym: Well, I mean, we don't know.

237
00:14:11,404 --> 00:14:14,060
Rym: We'd have to analyze them in similar detail to find out.

238
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,380
Scott: But he's just analyzing the original real deal arcade one, right?

239
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:24,040
Rym: But this is right down to like the speed of Pac-Man and the ghosts and how it changes over time based on how many pellets you've taken.

240
00:14:24,981 --> 00:14:27,600
Rym: The logic the ghosts use to figure out where to go is pretty cool.

241
00:14:27,781 --> 00:14:31,239
Rym: And in case you were a gamer who always suspected but could never prove it.

242
00:14:31,901 --> 00:14:34,171
Rym: Yes, the ghosts did have different personalities.

243
00:14:34,211 --> 00:14:35,959
Rym: They all had completely different logic.

244
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:41,620
Rym: And because it made sense that the red guy was always coming after you and that sort of thing.

245
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,003
Rym: But you can see their paths.

246
00:14:43,064 --> 00:14:49,300
Rym: And the cool thing is what they would always do is every second they would be calculating a spot and they're trying to get to that spot.

247
00:14:49,662 --> 00:14:52,699
Rym: But the spot they're trying to get to is changing all the time based on where Pac-Man is.

248
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:59,100
Rym: So someone made him out of the game where you can see the dots that show where the ghosts are trying to get to.

249
00:14:59,723 --> 00:15:02,240
Scott: That must make it really easy to win because you just...

250
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:08,960
Rym: But remember they're reacting to you in real time so you know where they're trying to get but that dot is jumping all over the place as you move.

251
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:16,220
Scott: Yeah, but I mean it still would make it a lot easier to win because you'd know like you'd be going one way and you'd realize you were going to be trapped.

252
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:20,839
Scott: You know sometimes you'd be going down a hallway and like a ghost will look like he's going to hit you.

253
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,740
Scott: So you turn around and you end up dying but actually that ghost turned a different way.

254
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,020
Scott: You know and you could have made it if you would have gone that way.

255
00:15:27,161 --> 00:15:30,840
Rym: If you read this you can figure out which ghost is almost always going to turn away.

256
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,600
Scott: Oh, that's good stuff.

257
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,519
Scott: It is good stuff.

258
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,232
Scott: Yeah the thing is even so.

259
00:15:35,252 --> 00:15:36,280
Scott: you'd have to think fast.

260
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:41,320
Scott: You'd have to be like orange ghost keep going or blue ghost turn around and you know that kind of stuff.

261
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,758
Rym: But it's interesting that a game that appears so simple when you play it.

262
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,914
Rym: And a lot of times people will think it's very random because they don't understand how games work.

263
00:15:50,954 --> 00:15:52,680
Rym: or they're not good at them or they're a kid or something.

264
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:57,460
Rym: But the game as simple as it is had a lot of really interesting emergent behavior that appeared.

265
00:15:58,101 --> 00:16:03,500
Rym: But if you actually analyze it fully it's all still completely 100 percent deterministic.

266
00:16:03,981 --> 00:16:05,166
Scott: No, well it's a computer.

267
00:16:05,267 --> 00:16:08,420
Scott: It can't be non-deterministic unless it's broken.

268
00:16:08,981 --> 00:16:12,540
Rym: Well I mean you could use random numbers to see behavior and that sort of thing.

269
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,951
Scott: Yes but the random numbers are deterministic.

270
00:16:15,032 --> 00:16:16,700
Scott: They're not real random numbers.

271
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:17,999
Rym: Well Scott what if you used a true...

272
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,600
Scott: Especially not in a weak ass old arcade machine.

273
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:25,660
Rym: What if you used a true or semi-true random number generator like say a thermal delta switch.

274
00:16:26,442 --> 00:16:27,720
Scott: Well you know that's a different story.

275
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:37,700
Scott: But that would create possibly... You could actually... That would be really interesting if you had a true random number generator or something like that and you used it in some sort of game.

276
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,480
Scott: You could perhaps make a game that is unwinnable.

277
00:16:42,202 --> 00:16:44,320
Rym: Well it's not that hard to make a game that's unwinnable.

278
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,720
Rym: Mario starts, there's no floor.

279
00:16:47,741 --> 00:16:48,178
Rym: That's it.

280
00:16:49,741 --> 00:16:53,820
Scott: I mean you know an interesting unwinnable game.

281
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,278
Rym: So it's like that cat Mario mod game.

282
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:01,176
Scott: Basically it would be a game where there is no optimal strategy because you're going against true randomness.

283
00:17:01,257 --> 00:17:01,819
Scott: but you know...

284
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,387
Rym: But Scott you can effectively get true randomness.

285
00:17:04,489 --> 00:17:06,214
Rym: I say effectively with dice.

286
00:17:06,757 --> 00:17:07,440
Rym: We have that.

287
00:17:08,101 --> 00:17:09,260
Scott: Yeah dice are pretty random.

288
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,079
Rym: Actually you know in World War II how they generated one-time pads in Britain for the military to use?

289
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:19,619
Rym: Old ladies rolling bingo things basically.

290
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:20,400
Scott: Oh bingo balls?

291
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,579
Scott: No that's not bad.

292
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,880
Rym: They'd roll something, pull out a number, write the number down, roll something, pull out another number, write the number down.

293
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:26,537
Scott: Uh huh.

294
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,079
Scott: Yeah.

295
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:27,692
Scott: That works.

296
00:17:29,302 --> 00:17:30,459
Rym: So do you have a thing of the day?

297
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,535
Scott: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

298
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:36,720
Scott: So I was poking around looking at you know game engines right?

299
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,740
Scott: Because you know I was talking like water is poison.

300
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,540
Scott: We're like hey let's make like a Half-Life mod.

301
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,540
Scott: All these punk kids do it.

302
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,318
Scott: We can do it too right?

303
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,120
Scott: We're professionals.

304
00:17:43,883 --> 00:17:48,900
Scott: And of course there's a long story behind that but that wasn't going to work out.

305
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:53,556
Scott: So I started poking around and I'm like there has to be some sort of open source game engine.

306
00:17:53,576 --> 00:17:54,600
Scott: that's all awesome like.

307
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,040
Rym: Well see I was about to say there are plenty but then you just said awesome.

308
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:58,928
Scott: Yeah.

309
00:17:59,881 --> 00:18:04,620
Scott: So every game engine out there seems to either be limited, not awesome.

310
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,860
Scott: I mean there's zillions of them out there right?

311
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,440
Scott: But they're either crap, limited, cost money.

312
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:12,560
Scott: Pretty much all of them are flawed in some way.

313
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,979
Scott: They're in a bad language that no one wants to use.

314
00:18:15,449 --> 00:18:15,738
Scott: You know?

315
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:19,440
Scott: Like there's one that's actually kind of okay called Joker, J Ogre.

316
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,360
Scott: It's a Java thing that like gives you a pretty standard.

317
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:23,104
Rym: Java.

318
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,940
Scott: Yeah it gives you a pretty standard MVC framework for you know making sort of simple multiplayer games.

319
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:33,120
Scott: Like if you want to make board games like this handles like already you don't have to do any work.

320
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,163
Scott: It does like.

321
00:18:34,464 --> 00:18:37,660
Scott: you know the lobbies and the joining and the whole thing and it just works.

322
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:38,239
Scott: I tried it.

323
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:38,736
Scott: It totally works.

324
00:18:39,422 --> 00:18:43,860
Scott: But the thing is you can't make anything that looks nice because it's all swing gooeys.

325
00:18:44,282 --> 00:18:50,277
Scott: So you'd have to basically do a whole shit ton of work to make anything that looks cool or it just looks like you know Java gooeys.

326
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:56,800
Scott: But anyway in the course of that I found this thing called love right?

327
00:18:57,449 --> 00:18:57,620
Rym: And that.

328
00:18:59,007 --> 00:18:59,760
Rym: You found love.

329
00:19:00,261 --> 00:19:05,520
Scott: Not love as in the emotion but love as in the game engine called love.

330
00:19:05,882 --> 00:19:09,035
Scott: And love the game engine isn't really.

331
00:19:09,276 --> 00:19:10,340
Scott: it's pretty limited right?

332
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,860
Scott: It falls into the limited category.

333
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,900
Scott: You can't make a multiplayer game with this right?

334
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:15,824
Scott: You can't make.

335
00:19:16,306 --> 00:19:19,199
Scott: you know a lot of you can't make like really fancy games with this.

336
00:19:19,782 --> 00:19:24,700
Scott: But what it is is you can make games using a language called Lua.

337
00:19:24,861 --> 00:19:25,295
Scott: L-U-A.

338
00:19:26,381 --> 00:19:30,940
Scott: And for people who don't know Lua is like this really sort of simple programming language.

339
00:19:31,061 --> 00:19:35,080
Scott: And a lot of like a lot of things will use it as the configuration.

340
00:19:35,301 --> 00:19:39,912
Scott: Like if you use lighty the web server like all the configuration files are written in Lua.

341
00:19:40,201 --> 00:19:43,679
Scott: So it's it's meant to be very human readable and very easy to do.

342
00:19:44,501 --> 00:19:50,700
Scott: And if you use love you can very easily make sort of simple 2D games.

343
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:51,303
Scott: You know like.

344
00:19:51,343 --> 00:19:58,757
Scott: if you want to make you know something like you know just something one of those like little indie demo kind of things like something like passage.

345
00:19:58,777 --> 00:19:59,908
Scott: you can make passage in love.

346
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:04,538
Scott: You could make what's the one with the chandelier and the.

347
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,080
Rym: I have no idea what you're talking about.

348
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,980
Scott: Remember the one where you drop the chandelier and the monster.

349
00:20:09,323 --> 00:20:10,639
Scott: It's just it's just to fight the boss.

350
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,880
Scott: There was like the little quirky little indie game.

351
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,000
Rym: I remember it vaguely.

352
00:20:15,442 --> 00:20:15,695
Scott: Yeah.

353
00:20:16,681 --> 00:20:17,726
Scott: But anyway you can make that.

354
00:20:17,907 --> 00:20:18,992
Scott: you know anything like that.

355
00:20:19,032 --> 00:20:22,159
Scott: you know a cute small game you can make in love really really easy.

356
00:20:22,561 --> 00:20:25,080
Rym: So when are we going to see the first Scott production.

357
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:25,877
Scott: I don't know.

358
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:39,240
Scott: But the point is is that if you have a get an idea for some like sort of cute little 2D game you could crack you could smack that thing out in love and like you know less than a day like pretty easily depending on how you know real quick.

359
00:20:40,241 --> 00:20:48,497
Scott: So you know if someone wants to make like a platform game that's like you know just one screen something like line right or you could probably make you know anything along those lines.

360
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,900
Scott: You can probably make a tower defense but it'd be it'd be a little difficult.

361
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:52,320
Rym: I don't know.

362
00:20:52,361 --> 00:20:53,420
Rym: Tower Defense right.

363
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:57,640
Rym: It seems like it had this high rise and I feel like it's a dying genre already.

364
00:20:58,401 --> 00:21:05,699
Rym: Yeah I mean I played like the last 10 that I've seen just briefly and they were all like exactly the same if not worse.

365
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,526
Scott: Well you know it's pretty much.

366
00:21:07,587 --> 00:21:12,999
Scott: they sort of try to differentiate themselves by changing superficial things without changing any fundamental things.

367
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,839
Rym: Yeah so you shoot like a zombie or you shoot.

368
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,463
Scott: Well it's like that.

369
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:37,737
Scott: some of them are like OK you can upgrade these things with gems and another one is like OK you can combine the gems together and another one is like all right you don't actually upgrade anything you just put towers next to each other and which towers are adjacent to each other determines changes the towers themselves and they do stuff like that.

370
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:46,580
Rym: Maybe I think that's part of the reason why I like the old desktop tower defense so much was that it kind of did away with scanning and theme really and it was just a tower defense.

371
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,499
Scott: The theme was it's your desk.

372
00:21:48,881 --> 00:21:52,440
Rym: But none of the things made much sense in that regard.

373
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,780
Scott: There were things you were drawing on your desk with a pencil.

374
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,238
Rym: That was the theme?

375
00:21:56,861 --> 00:21:58,440
Scott: You can see it's desktop tower defense.

376
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,059
Scott: The background is a desk.

377
00:22:00,701 --> 00:22:03,180
Rym: But the structures were basically just little blobs.

378
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,660
Scott: Well that's what you're doodling.

379
00:22:05,121 --> 00:22:06,580
Rym: OK yeah that's kind of weak.

380
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,151
Scott: Well that's that's the theme of desktop tower defense.

381
00:22:09,211 --> 00:22:10,920
Scott: it's literally desktop tower defense.

382
00:22:11,241 --> 00:22:14,940
Rym: But what I'm saying is that the theme was like barely there and didn't affect the game.

383
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:15,345
Scott: You're talking about.

384
00:22:15,365 --> 00:22:16,619
Scott: the theme was incredibly strong.

385
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,158
Scott: It's everything's drawn all pencil-y right.

386
00:22:20,384 --> 00:22:22,440
Scott: The background is a picture of the top of a desk.

387
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,849
Rym: OK so it had a background.

388
00:22:23,889 --> 00:22:25,340
Rym: the rest it wasn't really drawn sketchily.

389
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,618
Rym: Do I have to pull up screenshots of it again?

390
00:22:27,061 --> 00:22:27,719
Scott: Go look at it.

391
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,276
Scott: You'll see it.

392
00:22:28,581 --> 00:22:29,739
Scott: I can't believe you didn't know this.

393
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,634
Scott: This is like it was obvious for the moment.

394
00:22:31,674 --> 00:22:32,339
Scott: I first played it.

395
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,440
Scott: The theme is very strong anyway.

396
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,419
Rym: Alright I argue that the theme is weak but we digress.

397
00:22:39,141 --> 00:22:42,360
Scott: Anyway so yeah if you want to make a little tiny game you can you can get some love.

398
00:22:43,186 --> 00:22:45,080
Scott: It's free and open source and all that and whatnot.

399
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:50,820
Rym: So for the last many years there's been this kind of FPS's event in a state.

400
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:58,700
Rym: You hear us complain about FPS's all the time but just recently this gigantic monolith has been dropped amidst the Halo players.

401
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:05,024
Scott: Yeah I mean basically what happened is you know there were FPS's were pretty much all in software.

402
00:23:05,064 --> 00:23:09,280
Scott: you know is Wolfenstein, Doom, Doom, Quake, Quake, Quake, Quake right.

403
00:23:11,484 --> 00:23:13,294
Scott: And that was what the FPS was.

404
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,620
Scott: And then you know other FPS's came around.

405
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:20,220
Scott: You had the GoldenEye, Half-Life, and Halo were pretty much like the big three.

406
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,860
Scott: That sort of an unreal tournament not so much.

407
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,300
Scott: It was sort of off to the side.

408
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,620
Scott: It was always like a second fiddle.

409
00:23:28,081 --> 00:23:30,300
Scott: But those three came along and sort of changed FPS's.

410
00:23:30,921 --> 00:23:32,260
Scott: You know Counter-Strike especially.

411
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,191
Scott: You know it's like okay no more of the.

412
00:23:34,533 --> 00:23:35,560
Scott: you know deathmatch.

413
00:23:36,143 --> 00:23:39,520
Scott: No more of the really fast Twitch gameplay.

414
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,039
Scott: Now we're going to have a slow game.

415
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:46,520
Scott: You know it's all about being slow and crafty and it's all you got to reload your weapons.

416
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,140
Scott: You know and it's not about Twitch.

417
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:53,080
Scott: It's about which path you're taking and can you aim and all that sort of stuff.

418
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,200
Rym: Well I would argue more that it's much simpler than that.

419
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:58,960
Rym: It was just that consoles became the primary means of gameplay.

420
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,360
Scott: Well that was later though.

421
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:04,760
Scott: I mean I think that the old school FPS died before the console.

422
00:24:05,122 --> 00:24:08,239
Scott: You know because Counter-Strike was there for a few years.

423
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,940
Scott: You know killing off Quake before Halo came along.

424
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,280
Rym: But at the same time Counter-Strike is still pretty old school.

425
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,939
Rym: I mean it's still a difficult awesome FPS.

426
00:24:18,143 --> 00:24:22,840
Rym: If you don't have the raw aiming and maneuvering FPS skills you can't play Counter-Strike.

427
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:23,615
Scott: That's true.

428
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,080
Scott: But I guess Counter-Strike is sort of the in between.

429
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,780
Scott: It's sort of like you know but it's definitely not.

430
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:29,540
Scott: It's not Quake.

431
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:30,920
Scott: It's not the same.

432
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,000
Scott: It's not old school.

433
00:24:33,142 --> 00:24:34,179
Scott: It's semi old school.

434
00:24:34,301 --> 00:24:35,320
Rym: I don't know it's not that.

435
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:43,739
Rym: I mean the only difference between it and say like action Quake team play was that action Quake team play was well I don't know three or four times faster.

436
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:44,760
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

437
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,046
Scott: The speed makes it.

438
00:24:46,147 --> 00:24:47,192
Scott: you know it's just what you think.

439
00:24:47,212 --> 00:24:48,560
Scott: it's just one factor the speed.

440
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,700
Scott: But no that one factor makes like this entire world of difference.

441
00:24:51,720 --> 00:25:03,869
Rym: But just to simplify there was this combination of one consoles which have very weak controls compared to a PC for FPS's and two this drive toward realism and trying to make games FPS's at least very realistic and gritty.

442
00:25:03,929 --> 00:25:09,360
Rym: and the more realistic you make an FPS it's kind of like the difference between Soul Calibur and Bushido Blade.

443
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,678
Rym: Bushido Blade's a lot more realistic in one regard but it makes it a completely different game as a result.

444
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:14,639
Scott: Bad game.

445
00:25:15,161 --> 00:25:19,059
Rym: And for a long time we really wanted to bring back the old school FPS's.

446
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:22,099
Rym: I mean I love natural selection and it's doing okay.

447
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,920
Rym: I mean the community is still pretty strong.

448
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:28,500
Rym: And I love tribes too but there's just no way to make the tribes 2 community come back again.

449
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,060
Rym: It's just impossible.

450
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,969
Scott: I mean they they're trying recently.

451
00:25:31,009 --> 00:25:33,683
Scott: they do it like the tribes revival or whatever but it's not.

452
00:25:34,187 --> 00:25:36,060
Scott: it's not coming on as strong as it needs to.

453
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:46,137
Scott: And the major problem there is that tribes is a game that needs you know servers that have like 40 people on them and you know it's just a game that doesn't work unless a shit ton of people are playing it.

454
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:55,269
Scott: So basically we're sitting here and we got some FPS's to play but we're missing the old school flavor and it's sort of like.

455
00:25:55,289 --> 00:25:59,684
Scott: you know you have this genre FPS and within the genre there are flavors.

456
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:14,812
Scott: you know the slow tactical and the the military and the the team based one with vehicles right and you got all these you know sub-genres but the sub-genre of really fast twitch just fucking kill.

457
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,780
Scott: everyone sort of died out.

458
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,980
Scott: I mean there was Quake 4 but no one who plays Quake 4.

459
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:21,920
Rym: No one plays Quake 4.

460
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,300
Scott: No one plays Quake 4 right.

461
00:26:23,761 --> 00:26:28,675
Scott: So much to our surprise right Quake Live comes.

462
00:26:29,356 --> 00:26:30,078
Scott: you know it's been.

463
00:26:30,118 --> 00:26:33,854
Scott: it's been around for you know a while but the beta opened up like a week ago.

464
00:26:33,894 --> 00:26:35,180
Scott: I think something like that.

465
00:26:35,441 --> 00:26:36,224
Scott: not too long ago.

466
00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:40,097
Scott: the Quake Live beta opened up and I was you know I was curious.

467
00:26:40,739 --> 00:26:43,493
Scott: so we go in and it's like okay Quake in the web browser.

468
00:26:43,553 --> 00:26:44,177
Scott: what's you know?

469
00:26:44,217 --> 00:26:44,599
Scott: what are they?

470
00:26:44,619 --> 00:26:45,557
Scott: what are they going to do here.

471
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,624
Rym: And it's not even.

472
00:26:46,684 --> 00:26:48,172
Rym: I mean you can't say it's a web plug.

473
00:26:48,213 --> 00:26:53,780
Rym: it's basically just you download Quake and then it interfaces through the web browser to like set up your game.

474
00:26:53,960 --> 00:27:02,258
Scott: Yeah basically instead of installing Quake as its own application it's just installs as a browser plug-in but you're still just installing Quake it's not you know?

475
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:11,180
Scott: I mean you can if you want to keep the quake window inside your browser window thus making it really hard to see instead of playing full screen.

476
00:27:11,861 --> 00:27:14,590
Rym: Now the end result is that this is brilliant.

477
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:22,844
Rym: I mean it's Quake 3. it's an old game and they brought it back in this capacity but all they've really done is solved the problem I've been having for years of.

478
00:27:23,226 --> 00:27:24,590
Rym: I like old school FPSs.

479
00:27:24,651 --> 00:27:25,935
Rym: I like difficult FPSs.

480
00:27:26,377 --> 00:27:37,279
Rym: I want other people to play these FPSs but those games are so inaccessible and even if they are accessible as a game on the meta perspective there's no way to get a game of it going.

481
00:27:37,299 --> 00:27:45,460
Rym: do you know how hard it is to like get a bunch of Halo kids to download Quake 3 install it connect to my server with an IP address and then play a deathmatch.

482
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,204
Rym: Yeah I mean people.

483
00:27:46,224 --> 00:27:51,512
Scott: you know you're used to playing Halo and you're used to playing games on Steam right where you have sort of easy it's.

484
00:27:51,552 --> 00:27:56,495
Scott: you know there's a list of servers and you just click on one and you're playing and they handle that for you.

485
00:27:56,736 --> 00:28:06,667
Scott: you don't realize that Quake 1, 2, 3 all those old games even Quake 3 there was no really good server match up thing.

486
00:28:06,687 --> 00:28:07,920
Scott: there was no list of servers.

487
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,211
Rym: I used to have literally this text file I saved to my desktop and it listed all the.

488
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:22,903
Scott: Yeah people would use things like you know GameSpy and Kali in order to you know get server lists.

489
00:28:22,984 --> 00:28:26,700
Scott: it was sort of like they would have separate programs to list the servers.

490
00:28:27,022 --> 00:28:30,520
Scott: then they would double click on one in the list and I would launch the game separately.

491
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,598
Rym: Well if you were smart you just use the CLQ.

492
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,365
Scott: Yes but you know you get.

493
00:28:34,385 --> 00:28:38,502
Scott: my point is that it wasn't easy to get a game of these things going.

494
00:28:38,642 --> 00:28:43,844
Scott: you know you had to find a server you had to be in the know it was and normal people couldn't do it.

495
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:46,901
Scott: I mean normal people could go to the store buy Quake 3 install it and play.

496
00:28:46,921 --> 00:28:49,290
Scott: they get a LAN game going on pretty easily.

497
00:28:49,611 --> 00:28:53,779
Scott: but to play an internet game required you know effort now extra effort.

498
00:28:54,160 --> 00:29:02,478
Rym: For a long time up to this point there have been a lot of arguments all over the internet I won't say our forums because it's everywhere people like us who play these old FPS's.

499
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:05,473
Rym: and then kids who say yeah they're not so different they're not so hard.

500
00:29:05,654 --> 00:29:22,680
Rym: my games are fine Halo's great and I mean those games are good games but they never really seem to understand just how difficult these old games are and how difficult it is to be good at them and not even good how difficult it is to kill a single person.

501
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:30,059
Scott: How difficult it is to get a weapon even though they're lying around all over the place and how difficult it is to not get killed.

502
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,450
Rym: Let alone how fast they go.

503
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:34,178
Rym: and Quake 3 is not even the fastest.

504
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,365
Rym: Quake 3 is slow it's just.

505
00:29:37,007 --> 00:29:38,694
Rym: we're never gonna get Quake 2 back.

506
00:29:39,256 --> 00:29:42,087
Rym: I've given up on playing like Mega TF with people again.

507
00:29:42,107 --> 00:29:45,240
Rym: yeah I think those games they're dinosaurs they're extinct.

508
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:45,640
Rym: I admit that.

509
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:56,704
Scott: When you kids go to play Quake Live and you see how fast it is right remember that that was actually when Quake 3 came out everyone who had played Quake 1 and 2 was like wow why is Quake 3 all slow?

510
00:29:56,724 --> 00:30:00,394
Scott: and so Quake Live is Quake 3 it's slow.

511
00:30:00,815 --> 00:30:05,929
Scott: Quake 1 and 2 are crazy fast like well correct speed.

512
00:30:07,153 --> 00:30:08,638
Scott: Quake 3 is slow but yeah.

513
00:30:09,481 --> 00:30:21,816
Rym: This has finally been solved because all over the internet now we have seen people Halo kids modern FPSers posting in forums and saying things to the effect of what the fuck I can't get any kills what's going on.

514
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:33,588
Scott: Yeah and the thing I sort of realized you know because I haven't played you know Quake like for more than five minutes in a very long time is that you know how simple the game is compared to a lot of other FPS is.

515
00:30:33,628 --> 00:30:36,941
Scott: I mean not even tribes 2 or NS but say Counter Strike.

516
00:30:36,981 --> 00:30:42,941
Scott: right and Counter Strike you've got buy menus you've got reload you've got crouch right.

517
00:30:43,122 --> 00:30:44,265
Scott: you know what Quake has.

518
00:30:44,606 --> 00:30:49,979
Scott: it's got change weapon shoot jump move and zoom in.

519
00:30:49,999 --> 00:30:51,325
Scott: that's pretty much all it has.

520
00:30:51,385 --> 00:30:53,234
Rym: yeah I mean those are all the controls.

521
00:30:53,274 --> 00:30:58,232
Scott: there are a couple of items but yeah there's a use button that you that you push.

522
00:30:58,272 --> 00:31:04,975
Rym: maybe like once a century you don't even have to click anything to open doors doors just open.

523
00:31:05,156 --> 00:31:09,291
Scott: yeah there is literally like the controls are so primitive.

524
00:31:09,351 --> 00:31:10,938
Scott: I mean I guess oh you move the mouse to aim.

525
00:31:10,978 --> 00:31:12,543
Scott: of course right but that's it.

526
00:31:12,724 --> 00:31:20,251
Scott: that's all the controls of Quake 3. yet the game is so incredibly difficult compared to games with other controls.

527
00:31:20,291 --> 00:31:20,412
Scott: like.

528
00:31:20,432 --> 00:31:33,392
Scott: you can learn how to play in like a minute you know because the controls are so few but if you play against anyone who knows what they're doing at all you're just going to get killed instantly because the game is so fast and requires such reflexes and such.

529
00:31:33,713 --> 00:31:33,914
Scott: you know.

530
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:39,098
Scott: I guess this is a little bit of learning curve and learning what all the weapons do and learning what all the items do.

531
00:31:39,118 --> 00:31:45,372
Scott: you know like you got to know that green health lets you go above a hundred and yellow health doesn't and red armor is better than yellow armor.

532
00:31:45,392 --> 00:31:47,883
Rym: yeah the thing is you don't even need to know that stuff too well.

533
00:31:47,924 --> 00:31:53,363
Rym: you're pretty much just have to be able to move shoot and react quickly to things.

534
00:31:53,905 --> 00:31:57,983
Scott: yeah that'll that'll get you you know far enough to actually pick up some of these items.

535
00:31:58,204 --> 00:31:59,811
Rym: yeah but I mean I think like it.

536
00:32:00,072 --> 00:32:06,016
Rym: this made me though playing this again because I'd played Quake 3 and Quake 2 and all these games recently a whole bunch.

537
00:32:06,076 --> 00:32:19,228
Rym: but now that I'm playing them for real with other people on a regular basis I mean I have played Quake almost every day for the past week for like hours and I'm starting to remember all the things about all these old FPS.

538
00:32:19,248 --> 00:32:20,533
Rym: is that just don't happen anymore?

539
00:32:20,613 --> 00:32:21,437
Rym: like the?

540
00:32:21,537 --> 00:32:26,271
Rym: the precision required to aim is ludicrous for most kids.

541
00:32:26,312 --> 00:32:28,117
Scott: now I mean this is the railgun.

542
00:32:28,177 --> 00:32:31,369
Scott: right the railgun pretty much kills most people in one hit.

543
00:32:31,469 --> 00:32:35,165
Scott: if you hit them in the head yeah I mean it's it's really dangerous.

544
00:32:35,226 --> 00:32:40,795
Scott: I mean and the thing is most of the people you're fighting are you know it's rare that you come across someone with full health right.

545
00:32:41,077 --> 00:32:45,877
Scott: so if you hit them with it they're probably gonna die right and it actually goes through people.

546
00:32:45,917 --> 00:32:51,244
Scott: so if everyone lines up and you shoot it you can shoot it straight through them and kill like three or four people in one shot.

547
00:32:52,168 --> 00:32:55,258
Scott: you have to pretty much aim exactly on them you know.

548
00:32:55,339 --> 00:33:00,421
Scott: or it's a laser that pretty much as soon as you push the button it fires and that one spot and that's it.

549
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:06,818
Scott: it's a railgun yeah and it's really really hard to hit anyone with it.

550
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:16,466
Rym: if they're unless they're standing still like a doofus plus if you're playing a duel I mean these guys are moving three or four times faster than like Team Fortress and they're further away and the spaces are bigger.

551
00:33:17,168 --> 00:33:22,891
Rym: and if it's a full health like duel you've got to hit him in the head yeah his tiny little head.

552
00:33:22,971 --> 00:33:26,748
Scott: and if it's a duel right and there's less people on the map right.

553
00:33:26,808 --> 00:33:31,408
Scott: so if it's like a 16 player deathmatch all right everyone's running around getting shot at constantly.

554
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:39,519
Scott: if it's a duel one-on-one people have time to go around and get armor and get all kinds of weapons before you bump into them.

555
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:43,621
Rym: right unless you play one of the old school duel maps but none of those seem to be in here yet.

556
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:43,942
Rym: yeah.

557
00:33:44,363 --> 00:33:53,436
Scott: so if they got time to go run around and grab all this stuff by the time you meet them you're gonna need to hit them a whole lot before they hit you a whole lot.

558
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:55,929
Rym: of course you should have picked all this stuff up too.

559
00:33:56,231 --> 00:33:58,002
Scott: yeah but you know there's only one red arm.

560
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:00,817
Scott: so if one guy gets the red you're probably only gonna get the yellow now.

561
00:34:00,837 --> 00:34:02,970
Rym: you can avoid him until it comes and you can grab it too.

562
00:34:03,071 --> 00:34:08,563
Rym: I guess you know depending on the map and such plus if you're playing one-on-one you should be playing on a duel map where that's all taken care of.

563
00:34:08,905 --> 00:34:09,748
Scott: yeah that's true.

564
00:34:09,809 --> 00:34:11,215
Scott: also you know if it's a good duel map.

565
00:34:11,777 --> 00:34:13,123
Scott: I haven't actually played any duels.

566
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:14,772
Scott: I've been mostly playing deathmatches.

567
00:34:15,234 --> 00:34:15,775
Rym: yeah there's.

568
00:34:15,897 --> 00:34:18,447
Rym: there's just some sort of visceral fun about a death.

569
00:34:18,467 --> 00:34:20,618
Rym: I mean I forgot almost actually won one.

570
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:22,646
Rym: it was crazy about this time in my life.

571
00:34:22,987 --> 00:34:26,902
Rym: I've won like 10. it's not that of course I've played more than you.

572
00:34:26,963 --> 00:34:27,505
Scott: I only won.

573
00:34:27,525 --> 00:34:29,150
Scott: I almost won one just now.

574
00:34:29,391 --> 00:34:30,175
Scott: I was down by like two.

575
00:34:30,195 --> 00:34:30,676
Rym: it's amazing.

576
00:34:30,697 --> 00:34:39,139
Rym: you see the skill cab difference in a game like team fortress where once you get good enough like no one can be better than you because everyone's pretty much at this equal level.

577
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:43,373
Rym: but in quake you'll see someone where five minutes have gone by.

578
00:34:43,614 --> 00:34:52,931
Rym: they've got 40 frags the next person out of them has 39 person out of them has seven then there's a whole bunch of sevens and then everyone else has like negative two.

579
00:34:53,694 --> 00:34:57,191
Scott: yeah I mean you can always sort of tell if someone's really good.

580
00:34:57,231 --> 00:34:59,443
Scott: I mean like if there's someone on the server who's really good.

581
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:04,184
Scott: right they're just gonna win because they'll get the rail gunning and hit everyone with every single shot.

582
00:35:04,244 --> 00:35:04,485
Scott: right.

583
00:35:05,267 --> 00:35:10,989
Scott: but if everyone's sort of equal I remember the game really comes down to the fight over the quad damage.

584
00:35:11,009 --> 00:35:21,134
Scott: because you get the quad damage then that gives you the the upper hand you know for like about 30 seconds to hose enough people down to get like five or six frags and that's what's gonna give you the win.

585
00:35:21,294 --> 00:35:21,696
Rym: but I'm just.

586
00:35:21,736 --> 00:35:26,231
Rym: I'm having such visceral simple fun from playing an FPS.

587
00:35:26,251 --> 00:35:26,653
Rym: we're all.

588
00:35:26,693 --> 00:35:27,916
Rym: it's a it's a deathmatch.

589
00:35:28,277 --> 00:35:31,249
Rym: deathmatch is almost gone and now it's back a straight-up deathmatch.

590
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:34,643
Scott: yeah all they had to do right was they took the same exact game.

591
00:35:34,683 --> 00:35:35,806
Scott: they barely changed it.

592
00:35:35,847 --> 00:35:42,569
Scott: they sort of it's just pure quake right and they made it so that you can get at it easily.

593
00:35:42,589 --> 00:35:46,763
Scott: you don't need IP addresses you don't need any sort of funky user interface right.

594
00:35:47,024 --> 00:35:55,954
Scott: they put all the server matchups and all the you know user profiles and all the friend system and the whole thing in the web browser.

595
00:35:56,336 --> 00:36:02,901
Scott: and then as soon as you click you know join game it opens up and goes full screen or whatever with the plug-in and that's that's it.

596
00:36:03,422 --> 00:36:07,291
Rym: it's a game where you're trying to get frags and not get gibbed.

597
00:36:08,173 --> 00:36:26,319
Rym: yep though honestly the best thing I haven't been able to play FPS is like this for a long time but you know back in the day like playing in clans and being really like into this sort of thing and like practicing and these are FPS is where if you want to be good you've got to sit down with people and practice.

598
00:36:27,162 --> 00:36:29,049
Rym: let me do like shooting drill.

599
00:36:29,069 --> 00:36:34,449
Scott: yeah well look at a dude like fatality right that dude freaking practiced like almost all day every day.

600
00:36:34,469 --> 00:36:34,971
Scott: you know.

601
00:36:35,011 --> 00:36:36,899
Scott: he like he like trained like he was an athlete.

602
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:37,361
Scott: you know.

603
00:36:37,521 --> 00:36:37,942
Scott: that's how.

604
00:36:38,023 --> 00:36:39,989
Scott: that's why he was as good as he is.

605
00:36:40,571 --> 00:36:41,494
Rym: but this is I mean.

606
00:36:41,775 --> 00:36:45,789
Rym: I used to do anything I could that was within the rules to get an edge.

607
00:36:45,909 --> 00:36:53,655
Rym: and back in the quake two days I always played with an FOV of 120. so in a normal FPS by default you have a field of view of 90 degrees.

608
00:36:53,675 --> 00:36:58,374
Rym: so you see this 90 degree chunk out from the eyes of your model and that's what you see.

609
00:36:58,394 --> 00:37:02,694
Rym: now you don't have any peripheral vision or anything and that's just kind of the way FPS is were.

610
00:37:03,257 --> 00:37:10,563
Rym: but a lot of really hardcore people in the quake two days would turn off all the textures or weaken all the textures or change the textures.

611
00:37:10,623 --> 00:37:12,029
Rym: everything was kind of bland.

612
00:37:12,049 --> 00:37:28,646
Rym: you get a higher frame rate and then they'd widen the FOV to like 110 120 130 hmm this basically if you watch someone play like that or now with quake live you can just do it and see the whole world looks like a fishbowl and it's incredibly disorienting if you're not used to it.

613
00:37:29,068 --> 00:37:35,494
Rym: but if you can get used to it it gives you this gigantic edge over everyone else you can see people behind you and turn and shoot them.

614
00:37:36,016 --> 00:37:39,754
Rym: it becomes a game of click on all the heads that are floating around the screen before they click on yours.

615
00:37:40,196 --> 00:37:45,597
Scott: yeah well if you've you know got a railgun I mean if you don't you can't just click on the heads.

616
00:37:45,617 --> 00:37:45,978
Scott: you got it.

617
00:37:46,299 --> 00:37:49,250
Scott: yeah you got to maybe shoot a rocket at the feet you know.

618
00:37:49,511 --> 00:37:53,426
Scott: maybe throw some you know lead them with the plasma rifle a bit huh.

619
00:37:53,627 --> 00:37:58,610
Rym: the only thing that I'm missing that I feel like I should have are my offhand grenades but I can live without that.

620
00:37:59,012 --> 00:38:02,527
Scott: yeah well I mean you know you can get the grenade launcher if you really want to say there's.

621
00:38:02,628 --> 00:38:10,721
Rym: there was something about throwing a grenade at a guy's feet shooting a rocket throwing another grenade bouncing him off of the second grenade into the rocket.

622
00:38:11,444 --> 00:38:12,126
Scott: yeah I think you know.

623
00:38:12,668 --> 00:38:14,254
Scott: I guess they could put grenades in it.

624
00:38:14,314 --> 00:38:17,949
Scott: but yeah I guess there were grenades in quake 3 right so why should that?

625
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:19,256
Rym: I feel like they should leave it as is.

626
00:38:19,858 --> 00:38:26,380
Scott: I could foresee I'll bet that we that sort of gets rid of the the fact that it's this pure and simple game.

627
00:38:26,882 --> 00:38:29,312
Scott: you know in terms of you know the act the game itself.

628
00:38:29,533 --> 00:38:30,437
Rym: well what they could do?

629
00:38:30,457 --> 00:38:34,175
Rym: I it'd be really interesting if they open this platform up to more games than just quite three.

630
00:38:34,235 --> 00:38:36,466
Rym: like what if they put quite you and quick one on there?

631
00:38:36,486 --> 00:38:37,470
Rym: there's no reason not to.

632
00:38:37,872 --> 00:38:40,444
Scott: well I think this technically isn't quake 3 it's quake live.

633
00:38:40,524 --> 00:38:42,311
Scott: right they don't want to call it quake 3.

634
00:38:42,311 --> 00:38:43,355
Rym: well yeah but it's quite 3.

635
00:38:43,355 --> 00:38:47,713
Scott: yeah I there was an interview with Carmack and he talked about.

636
00:38:47,894 --> 00:38:48,837
Scott: you know stuff like.

637
00:38:48,878 --> 00:38:53,697
Scott: you know if there were gonna be mods on there and stuff like that and I think they were talking about like.

638
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:58,942
Scott: you know if they found maps from people that were really awesome they would put them in there and stuff like that.

639
00:38:59,042 --> 00:39:03,495
Scott: so there's there's definitely gonna be more content in there.

640
00:39:03,576 --> 00:39:04,318
Scott: at the very least.

641
00:39:04,779 --> 00:39:10,124
Scott: you know maybe more game modes because right now they got a few game modes and then they got CTF they got clan arena.

642
00:39:10,144 --> 00:39:14,222
Rym: yeah but they're all the like quake 3 modes and I'll admit I don't like any of those modes.

643
00:39:15,245 --> 00:39:17,051
Rym: back when they came out everyone hated him.

644
00:39:17,071 --> 00:39:17,833
Rym: they were terrible.

645
00:39:18,475 --> 00:39:22,652
Scott: yeah yeah well I mean that's the thing is you know it's like they're keeping it simple right.

646
00:39:22,813 --> 00:39:33,973
Scott: this isn't about you know revolutionizing FPS even though I think it will in a small way because well because it's taking the pure FPS and making it accessible to the masses.

647
00:39:34,053 --> 00:39:41,177
Rym: they took an FPS that I played in high school and just re-released it without doing much to it and it's already really popular.

648
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:53,036
Rym: it's in beta and it's in many ways it feels fresher than a lot of new FPS is because it's so different from most games that people play today even though it's a game from when I was in high school.

649
00:39:53,478 --> 00:39:57,012
Rym: I know right I bought quake 3 when I was in high school.

650
00:39:57,153 --> 00:39:58,317
Scott: I mean you could do the same thing.

651
00:39:58,337 --> 00:40:07,927
Scott: I mean think about right if you want to look for originality in video games right the old PC games is where you know there were no genres in those olden days.

652
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:08,850
Scott: you know things like.

653
00:40:09,111 --> 00:40:15,715
Scott: you know mule and Starcraft and you know all these sorts of things totally defy genre completely like there's.

654
00:40:15,756 --> 00:40:17,623
Scott: no those are the only games like those.

655
00:40:17,663 --> 00:40:18,806
Scott: that's it right.

656
00:40:19,308 --> 00:40:25,969
Scott: so if you get games like those from the early PC days and bring them back it's totally you know.

657
00:40:25,989 --> 00:40:26,470
Scott: it's.

658
00:40:26,671 --> 00:40:28,035
Scott: it's super fresh because this.

659
00:40:28,738 --> 00:40:38,712
Scott: you haven't played anything like that since the olden days and it's the same you know even though FPS is as a whole are not fresh right this style of FPS is fresh.

660
00:40:38,752 --> 00:40:53,910
Scott: I mean I could come out with like a Wolfenstein like game today right which is an FPS that primarily concentrates on you know mazes and secrets and that sort of thing as opposed to you know and down plays the shooting element and it would be totally fresh if you like that sort of thing you know.

661
00:40:54,773 --> 00:40:57,463
Rym: so maybe we should get the forum together and play some games.

662
00:40:57,503 --> 00:40:59,090
Rym: find one of those empty servers on there.

663
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,155
Scott: well you know the.

664
00:41:00,175 --> 00:41:01,761
Scott: it's got a friend system right.

665
00:41:01,781 --> 00:41:03,526
Scott: so just find out.

666
00:41:03,566 --> 00:41:05,492
Scott: you know who everyone else's name is.

667
00:41:05,853 --> 00:41:07,096
Rym: my name is Rym.

668
00:41:07,116 --> 00:41:08,782
Scott: yeah you can guess what my name is.

669
00:41:09,243 --> 00:41:11,633
Scott: and then you know add people to your friends list.

670
00:41:11,693 --> 00:41:12,436
Scott: it's pretty easy.

671
00:41:12,717 --> 00:41:17,295
Scott: and then when you're online fight look in their friends for you know who's playing.

672
00:41:17,315 --> 00:41:17,677
Scott: enjoy.

673
00:41:17,717 --> 00:41:22,876
Scott: now the thing is is a skill matching system and the skill matching system is pretty good.

674
00:41:23,076 --> 00:41:26,629
Scott: you know it's not like super perfect but it's in the beginning.

675
00:41:26,669 --> 00:41:32,573
Rym: it pretty much puts you in and says like get as far as you can get and then enter the and it doesn't even tell you anything.

676
00:41:32,934 --> 00:41:37,896
Scott: it's just like get as far as you can get in this room and then it when you can't get any further go in the door.

677
00:41:37,977 --> 00:41:38,539
Rym: it's great cuz.

678
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:43,660
Rym: first is like you know jump over this thing and then rocket jump over this thing and then bunny hop.

679
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:48,238
Rym: now bunny hopping again is something that has been like it's been taken out of.

680
00:41:48,278 --> 00:41:53,577
Rym: a lot of FPS is and all that kind of jumping fiddly almost glitchy stuff was taken out of.

681
00:41:53,637 --> 00:41:55,244
Rym: modern FPS is for a lot of reasons.

682
00:41:55,626 --> 00:41:59,322
Rym: but you know in quake one it was clearly a glitch but people used it was part of the game.

683
00:41:59,784 --> 00:42:01,933
Rym: quake two it was less of a glitch but it was still there.

684
00:42:02,234 --> 00:42:05,345
Rym: quake three they coded it in because they knew people wanted it.

685
00:42:05,365 --> 00:42:06,991
Rym: it was there on purpose.

686
00:42:07,392 --> 00:42:08,978
Rym: yep that think.

687
00:42:09,078 --> 00:42:18,491
Rym: think about how much the culture of FPS thing has changed from the glitch that was popular is coded into the game to the sterile ultra realistic games we have today.

688
00:42:18,511 --> 00:42:19,856
Scott: yeah I did the rocket jump.

689
00:42:19,896 --> 00:42:21,523
Scott: I didn't I couldn't I didn't do the be hop.

690
00:42:22,066 --> 00:42:25,723
Rym: well the thing is I think to fully do the be hop you got to start with a rocket.

691
00:42:25,903 --> 00:42:31,927
Scott: yeah I try to do the Rockets right and what happened was is I actually ran out of rocket and then I also kill.

692
00:42:31,947 --> 00:42:37,189
Scott: you know you're invincible so you couldn't kill yourself but you know I just ran out of rockets and I said fuck it and I went in the door.

693
00:42:37,932 --> 00:42:38,875
Scott: so yeah.

694
00:42:38,896 --> 00:42:43,695
Scott: and then you sort of fight this bot and I guess they sort of gauge how well you do against the bot.

695
00:42:43,796 --> 00:42:48,334
Scott: you know based on the bots difficulty which I think also changes a lot of people can't beat the bot.

696
00:42:48,696 --> 00:42:51,067
Scott: yeah it's it's weird that people didn't beat the bot.

697
00:42:51,087 --> 00:42:51,449
Scott: I mean like.

698
00:42:51,991 --> 00:42:54,744
Scott: I started fighting the bot and it killed me a little bit and I was like oh crap.

699
00:42:54,764 --> 00:42:56,190
Scott: and then I came back and beat it.

700
00:42:56,371 --> 00:43:02,094
Scott: but it was weird that people were like yeah the bot kicked my ass and I was like oh that's that's too bad.

701
00:43:02,295 --> 00:43:07,474
Rym: but pretty much anyone out there if you have a Windows PC quake 3 came out when I was in high school.

702
00:43:07,555 --> 00:43:09,663
Rym: you can probably run quake 3.

703
00:43:09,663 --> 00:43:13,036
Scott: you can definitely run quake 3. you could probably run this on a netbook most.

704
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:24,150
Scott: so if it has any sort of 3d at all like an integrated cheap ass you know graphics chip an Intel even an Intel integrated thing will play quake 3.

705
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:27,262
Rym: there is absolutely no reason not to download quake live and play it.

706
00:43:27,302 --> 00:43:34,247
Rym: at least try even if you don't like FPS is or even if you don't like this kind of twitchy deathmatch gibbon FPS.

707
00:43:34,688 --> 00:43:38,240
Rym: you should play it at least once to to see where we're coming from.

708
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:44,759
Rym: this is this game is like the midpoint between my perfect FPS and a modern Halo FPS mm-hmm.

709
00:43:44,939 --> 00:43:45,421
Scott: and I'm just.

710
00:43:45,521 --> 00:43:50,600
Scott: I'm just glad that you know there is a type of game that was that was lost and now is found.

711
00:43:50,901 --> 00:43:52,527
Scott: and you know people can.

712
00:43:52,607 --> 00:43:59,736
Scott: actually you know when when I say oh man you don't know old-school FPS is I can't say oh well yeah you're not actually gonna be able to play any of them.

713
00:43:59,777 --> 00:44:00,339
Scott: to find out.

714
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,660
Scott: now I can say here you can at least go play quake live and then you'll know what I'm talking about.

715
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,915
Rym: yeah because nothing was worse than nah man quick - was so much better.

716
00:44:08,015 --> 00:44:09,603
Rym: yeah well how do I play it all right?

717
00:44:09,623 --> 00:44:12,376
Rym: well first you got a pirate a copy of quake - I already got that.

718
00:44:12,436 --> 00:44:13,240
Scott: no it's open source.

719
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:16,350
Scott: but even so you got a pirate that the now the data file.

720
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:18,196
Rym: now edit this text file.

721
00:44:18,437 --> 00:44:20,063
Scott: yeah it's like already.

722
00:44:20,243 --> 00:44:26,668
Scott: they're not gonna do it you know you know even if you did it for them it they think you know when they I want to configure their controls.

723
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:30,384
Scott: and there were controls that configure that weren't in the control configuration menu.

724
00:44:30,404 --> 00:44:32,489
Scott: yeah that'd be the end of it.

725
00:44:33,091 --> 00:44:39,429
Scott: so but now you know it's accessible and it's gonna be eventually out on the Mac.

726
00:44:39,449 --> 00:44:46,266
Scott: and you know the Linux supposedly and it's it people everywhere are gonna be able to play quick together and happy times.

727
