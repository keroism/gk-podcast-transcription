1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,357
Rym: It's Thursday June 25th.

2
00:00:11,517 --> 00:00:12,300
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,381 --> 00:00:14,329
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:17,929
Rym: tonight We talk about the realization that all our heroes will eventually die.

5
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:26,917
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,961 --> 00:00:37,239
Rym: So I came home today to box on the porch and in that box were 20 smaller boxes.

7
00:00:40,144 --> 00:00:42,059
Scott: Why was there a box of boxes on the floor?

8
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:48,607
Rym: I needed boxes to pack up a lot of my books and stuff to get them off the floor since I wasn't about to buy a bookshelf for a Temporary house.

9
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:52,459
Rym: I'm not gonna buy like a No more half measures in my life.

10
00:00:52,921 --> 00:00:55,930
Scott: So so why didn't you just get some free boxes?

11
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:04,140
Rym: because free boxes are usually not a consistent size and shape And I have moved enough times to know that I'm willing to pay a premium to not have any difficulty whatsoever.

12
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,679
Scott: Uh-huh Well, you could have made you know you could have done is you could have bought like some sort of cardboard bookshelf?

13
00:01:12,769 --> 00:01:16,750
Rym: No Yeah, cuz you can't pack books in that you can't.

14
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:16,890
Scott: cuz.

15
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,720
Scott: then what you do is you slide the cardboard bookshelf into a box.

16
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:23,569
Scott: That is exactly the shape and width of the cardboard Something.

17
00:01:23,629 --> 00:01:24,780
Scott: and then there you go.

18
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,285
Rym: I realized something like that would cost a lot more money and not be that nice there when you get to the other end you Just owe a slide it out.

19
00:01:30,526 --> 00:01:33,399
Rym: Tada cuz I'm gonna get a real bookshelf at the other end.

20
00:01:34,601 --> 00:01:37,050
Scott: Yeah, but you could have the temporary cardboard bookshelf.

21
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:37,933
Rym: I don't need that.

22
00:01:37,953 --> 00:01:39,057
Scott: It's gonna be good.

23
00:01:39,077 --> 00:01:48,920
Rym: plus I mean I was looking online and buying New boxes was cheaper in most cases than buying used boxes or recycled boxes.

24
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:52,080
Scott: You don't buy used boxes you go and get them for like the supermarket.

25
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:58,445
Rym: Well, no if you want them in a consistent size and shape without any possibility of strange smells What's wrong with strange smells?

26
00:01:58,506 --> 00:02:03,185
Scott: Yeah, go to the UPS store and just go in the back Don't you know?

27
00:02:03,225 --> 00:02:04,758
Scott: don't take him from the front take him from the back.

28
00:02:05,563 --> 00:02:08,520
Rym: You mean steal them because you've got to buy them from the UPS store.

29
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,620
Scott: They haven't for you got to be buddy buddy with the people work there.

30
00:02:10,821 --> 00:02:11,987
Rym: Yeah, now you got.

31
00:02:12,028 --> 00:02:14,683
Rym: I mean, I'm gonna go to grocery stores and stuff to get a lot of the boxes I need.

32
00:02:14,723 --> 00:02:28,660
Rym: but for books you want to get small Consistently sized boxes that are guaranteed to hold the weight of a box full of books a zillion pounds Because the other mistake I made in the past was trying to put a whole bunch of books in one box.

33
00:02:29,962 --> 00:02:32,653
Rym: No, you need tiny little square boxes for books.

34
00:02:32,934 --> 00:02:34,480
Scott: Yep, because they are heavy.

35
00:02:35,841 --> 00:02:36,243
Rym: Plus.

36
00:02:36,363 --> 00:02:39,279
Rym: actually if you want free boxes supermarkets are so passÃ©.

37
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,485
Rym: That's not where you really want to go.

38
00:02:40,505 --> 00:02:43,619
Rym: You know where you really want to go the liquor store.

39
00:02:44,401 --> 00:02:47,160
Rym: Liquor stores have more boxes than grocery stores.

40
00:02:47,441 --> 00:02:55,640
Rym: there's nothing spilled on those boxes unless a bottle broke which is unlikely and You can also get partitions in the boxes to hold like kitchen stuff.

41
00:02:55,981 --> 00:02:58,669
Scott: Well, yeah, but but I mean, you know those partitions.

42
00:02:58,729 --> 00:03:00,294
Scott: it'd be nicer if the partitions are smaller.

43
00:03:00,715 --> 00:03:01,437
Rym: the pretty bigger.

44
00:03:01,457 --> 00:03:04,399
Rym: Scott those partitions Just come out if you don't want to use them.

45
00:03:04,721 --> 00:03:08,398
Scott: I know but I'm saying if you could modify the size of the partitions it'd be much better.

46
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,146
Rym: smaller Do you need?

47
00:03:09,167 --> 00:03:09,818
Rym: what are you gonna put like?

48
00:03:10,822 --> 00:03:15,638
Rym: bigger bigger because it's Like one pencil for not smaller.

49
00:03:15,698 --> 00:03:15,940
Scott: bigger.

50
00:03:17,382 --> 00:03:20,319
Rym: If you need bigger just get a smaller box and use more of them.

51
00:03:21,163 --> 00:03:25,400
Scott: Oh, maybe you can get one of those like ba boxes that came with like magnums of wine in it.

52
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,579
Scott: That would have bigger partitions.

53
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:34,800
Rym: Anyway, yeah, the other thing that came earlier was the RAM for the Mac mini.

54
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,784
Rym: Mac mini.

55
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:39,874
Rym: has you know, I bought the Mac mini early on in the Mac many days.

56
00:03:39,975 --> 00:03:41,500
Rym: I bought the slowest cheapest Mac.

57
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:42,364
Scott: Well, it wasn't.

58
00:03:42,424 --> 00:03:43,670
Scott: there was a g4 Mac mini.

59
00:03:43,731 --> 00:03:45,620
Scott: people don't remember that that I don't count that.

60
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:49,920
Scott: We have the very first core solo Mac mini and I got the minimum.

61
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:51,748
Rym: I didn't spend the 200 bucks for this.

62
00:03:51,929 --> 00:03:55,207
Scott: We did not realize that it only had like 512 meg of RAM.

63
00:03:56,261 --> 00:04:01,859
Rym: I realized that when I bought it and I didn't care because it was like four hundred dollars to get more RAM.

64
00:04:01,899 --> 00:04:03,404
Scott: Well Apple charge.

65
00:04:03,424 --> 00:04:06,416
Rym: Yeah, and back then the RAM that went into it was pretty expensive.

66
00:04:06,477 --> 00:04:08,187
Rym: So I figured screw it I got the cheapest one.

67
00:04:08,752 --> 00:04:13,680
Rym: you all remember the night I tried to record and then edit GeekNights on that thing with garage band.

68
00:04:14,581 --> 00:04:15,906
Scott: That was that's an old episode.

69
00:04:15,946 --> 00:04:19,459
Rym: that night is in the top 20 of worst nights of my life.

70
00:04:19,701 --> 00:04:21,346
Rym: Well, I was up until like 3 a.m.

71
00:04:21,367 --> 00:04:24,680
Rym: Because remember I had burned every bridge.

72
00:04:25,101 --> 00:04:28,836
Rym: I when I plug that Mac in on my desk into that CRT that 19 inch CRT.

73
00:04:30,481 --> 00:04:34,552
Rym: It was so beautiful and I had unplugged my computer and like moved it aside.

74
00:04:34,592 --> 00:04:36,216
Rym: It was completely dismantled effectively.

75
00:04:36,236 --> 00:04:38,923
Rym: Mm-hmm and Around.

76
00:04:38,943 --> 00:04:41,377
Scott: the thing is realizing now, right?

77
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:50,300
Scott: Even if you had liked OS X and I like garage band and liked all that stuff That Mac Mini was not powerful enough to be your computer.

78
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:57,140
Rym: Well by any stretch it would have been had I never ventured into video and had I never wanted to play a computer game again.

79
00:04:57,883 --> 00:05:00,236
Rym: Yeah, cuz back then what computer game was gonna play?

80
00:05:00,738 --> 00:05:00,939
Rym: what?

81
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:02,622
Scott: Now?

82
00:05:02,924 --> 00:05:04,452
Rym: now yeah, and s2 is coming.

83
00:05:04,653 --> 00:05:05,397
Scott: you would have been l4d lists.

84
00:05:06,281 --> 00:05:12,100
Rym: But I remember around midnight when I gave up plug my old computer back in spend an hour setting it up.

85
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,269
Rym: It was about 4 a.m.

86
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:14,156
Rym: When I uploaded that.

87
00:05:14,196 --> 00:05:16,367
Scott: show Was a good times though.

88
00:05:16,387 --> 00:05:18,035
Rym: No, it was a terrible times.

89
00:05:18,296 --> 00:05:19,240
Rym: It was a terrible night.

90
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:25,964
Rym: I rue that day, but the Mac Mini served a much better purpose not as a primary computer But as a media PC.

91
00:05:26,004 --> 00:05:30,700
Rym: because whatever you want to say about Apple their industrial design is some of the best in the world.

92
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:31,800
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty much.

93
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,533
Scott: It's pretty much the only thing they've actually had to sell Mac Mini.

94
00:05:35,714 --> 00:05:39,727
Rym: all the iterations of it are The perfect size the perfect weight.

95
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,572
Rym: They are completely silence.

96
00:05:42,074 --> 00:05:43,960
Rym: They're tiny and they're beautiful.

97
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:47,570
Rym: yeah, and We bought RAM for it.

98
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:47,851
Rym: Now.

99
00:05:47,892 --> 00:05:50,205
Rym: It has two gigs of RAM We had.

100
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:51,513
Scott: it's much less painful.

101
00:05:51,554 --> 00:05:52,137
Scott: watch movies.

102
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:56,880
Rym: We had a living room jam a putty knife and pry the top off to get into it.

103
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,760
Scott: Yeah, getting that opening it up and fiddling with it was not a pleasure.

104
00:06:00,901 --> 00:06:02,912
Scott: It's not something you're supposed to do.

105
00:06:02,992 --> 00:06:06,488
Scott: So I didn't expect it to be a pleasure But I do it and it works.

106
00:06:06,549 --> 00:06:07,733
Scott: So fuck you Steve Jobs.

107
00:06:07,793 --> 00:06:08,597
Scott: I opened your box.

108
00:06:08,637 --> 00:06:09,420
Scott: What you gonna do about it?

109
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:19,979
Rym: Yeah, the other thing that came is I have my hands a 1 terabyte external drive that I'm finally properly backing up all of GeekNights' on - But that wasn't my reason for buying it.

110
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:27,301
Rym: I bought it because I got a. basically I'm giving up on Linux for now and I'm gonna have a Windows 7 computers my primary Computer.

111
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:37,274
Scott: Yeah, I mean I pretty much you know, I I use Linux pretty much all the time every day all over the place But it's always in a virtual machine or on a server or actually also on my laptop.

112
00:06:37,454 --> 00:06:39,160
Scott: But yeah, that's pretty much it.

113
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:39,804
Rym: That's the direction.

114
00:06:39,844 --> 00:06:40,186
Rym: I'm going.

115
00:06:40,206 --> 00:06:44,933
Rym: I'm gonna have a Windows box with a one Virtualized Linux image in it.

116
00:06:45,457 --> 00:06:53,500
Rym: Hmm I mean my laptops could be up Linux except for the fact that Windows seems to still have better power management and better support for the weird.

117
00:06:53,500 --> 00:07:01,736
Scott: Well, I mean if I wasn't doing all this gaming and other stuff, you know I would probably still I would run Linux on my desktop also, but I am doing that stuff.

118
00:07:01,837 --> 00:07:02,740
Rym: Yeah, I mean, what do I do?

119
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:07,737
Rym: I do gaming and multimedia Development which are the two things Linux can't do.

120
00:07:07,758 --> 00:07:14,164
Scott: Yeah Well, actually, you know, there's some things happening in Linux department that are Scott's coming up from behind.

121
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:18,536
Rym: will dual head work without me having to go through arbitrary bullshit.

122
00:07:19,158 --> 00:07:19,980
Scott: You mean two monitors?

123
00:07:20,261 --> 00:07:22,429
Scott: Yes, that's worked for a long time perfectly.

124
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:25,040
Rym: Yeah, absolutely perfectly as good as Windows.

125
00:07:25,301 --> 00:07:27,869
Rym: Yeah without any problem ever of any kind.

126
00:07:27,929 --> 00:07:30,116
Rym: What's no no possible problem in Ubuntu.

127
00:07:30,136 --> 00:07:31,440
Scott: Yeah, this works.

128
00:07:31,862 --> 00:07:34,980
Scott: You've never had a just works for like three versions of Ubuntu.

129
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:39,040
Rym: Never had a dialog box pop up in the middle between two monitors ever.

130
00:07:40,061 --> 00:07:41,004
Rym: That's a deal-breaker for me.

131
00:07:41,024 --> 00:07:41,867
Rym: If that happens, I'm done.

132
00:07:41,887 --> 00:07:44,957
Scott: happens if you use some like shady ass programs in Iran.

133
00:07:44,977 --> 00:07:49,290
Rym: Yeah That was the last time I tried dual head on a Linux box.

134
00:07:49,451 --> 00:07:50,775
Rym: Yeah, I use cinerama.

135
00:07:50,996 --> 00:07:51,980
Scott: Yeah, that was a long time ago.

136
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,385
Scott: Yeah, no, that's that's fake.

137
00:07:53,405 --> 00:08:03,880
Scott: the problems you have now or so are more basic things like There is no real video editing software except cinellara, which is shit, but they're working on something new, but it's not ready yet.

138
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:11,891
Rym: But to get back to the boxes I was pleased that my box of boxes arrived and there was a note in the box of boxes saying Don't forget you can use the box.

139
00:08:11,911 --> 00:08:13,480
Rym: the boxes came in to pack something.

140
00:08:15,323 --> 00:08:16,137
Rym: Don't throw it away.

141
00:08:17,523 --> 00:08:21,739
Rym: It's great for paintings and stuff And it is it's kind of in that shape.

142
00:08:22,582 --> 00:08:22,943
Scott: All right.

143
00:08:22,963 --> 00:08:25,470
Rym: The other thing is this box of boxes.

144
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:26,693
Scott: How much was the box of boxes?

145
00:08:26,894 --> 00:08:28,157
Rym: It was 40 bucks for 20 box.

146
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,085
Scott: That's a lot of money.

147
00:08:30,528 --> 00:08:30,931
Rym: No tax.

148
00:08:30,951 --> 00:08:31,394
Rym: No shipping.

149
00:08:31,575 --> 00:08:32,280
Scott: That's a lot of money.

150
00:08:32,481 --> 00:08:35,873
Rym: Not really look at the UPS store or you haul.

151
00:08:35,914 --> 00:08:36,837
Rym: buying them in person.

152
00:08:36,857 --> 00:08:39,347
Scott: cause more than that I know but I'm still saying it's a lot of money.

153
00:08:39,448 --> 00:08:41,840
Scott: That's how much the liquor store for free.

154
00:08:42,302 --> 00:08:43,730
Rym: Yeah, but those aren't the right kind of boxes.

155
00:08:43,831 --> 00:08:45,420
Rym: I am getting boxes from the liquor store.

156
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:45,904
Rym: They're not.

157
00:08:46,045 --> 00:08:51,319
Rym: do not believe that I will not be getting Primarily to hold all of my liquor.

158
00:08:54,425 --> 00:08:56,166
Rym: great, I Don't know I. what am I gonna say?

159
00:08:56,186 --> 00:08:58,840
Rym: I couldn't top the alligator head story from Tuesday.

160
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,500
Scott: That's why we should have just you know, if you can't beat it just don't say anything gotta say something.

161
00:09:03,741 --> 00:09:04,182
Scott: No, you don't.

162
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:05,146
Rym: All right.

163
00:09:05,367 --> 00:09:06,973
Rym: So, uh, you got anything to say.

164
00:09:07,454 --> 00:09:08,137
Rym: no nothing.

165
00:09:08,579 --> 00:09:12,739
Rym: No Did you say beat it on purpose or is that just what I came out?

166
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:13,462
Scott: I didn't.

167
00:09:13,522 --> 00:09:15,216
Scott: I wasn't even thinking about that till you just said it.

168
00:09:15,397 --> 00:09:26,778
Rym: All right Well, I have one announcement not really a news, but we finished the previous book club of cavalier and clay Which is an amazing book and you should listen to both the preview and the final thoughts and read that book.

169
00:09:26,898 --> 00:09:27,380
Rym: It's amazing.

170
00:09:27,964 --> 00:09:46,817
Scott: Also, you know book club people I mean if you are not listening to the book clubs or not participating in the book club at least tell us Why and your thoughts and such because our goal with the book club is to increase reading of books without pictures Among the listenership

171
00:09:47,883 --> 00:09:52,660
Rym: While a lot of the people in the forum are pretty erudite and they seem to know their stuff.

172
00:09:53,525 --> 00:09:58,505
Rym: I got to tell you guys a lot of the emails we get Bali One's literacy.

173
00:09:58,747 --> 00:10:01,280
Scott: Yeah, so, you know, that's sort of our goal here.

174
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:04,494
Scott: So, you know if you're not liking the books we pick.

175
00:10:04,715 --> 00:10:09,360
Scott: if you think they're too long You don't you want us to change the format of the book?

176
00:10:10,302 --> 00:10:11,365
Scott: The frequency of it?

177
00:10:11,606 --> 00:10:14,776
Rym: if you don't like the books were suggesting you're wrong.

178
00:10:14,796 --> 00:10:15,900
Scott: Well, that's also true.

179
00:10:16,061 --> 00:10:17,546
Rym: We haven't suggested a bad book yet.

180
00:10:17,988 --> 00:10:18,952
Rym: Yeah, we're going to.

181
00:10:19,012 --> 00:10:20,679
Rym: don't worry, but a long time.

182
00:10:20,719 --> 00:10:20,960
Scott: for that.

183
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:26,400
Scott: We'll warn you when we do, you know, so let us you know, give us some feedback about yon book club.

184
00:10:26,841 --> 00:10:32,260
Rym: So I really really still wanted to pick the Odyssey, but I know none of you assholes are gonna read it.

185
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,023
Scott: I wouldn't even read it.

186
00:10:33,204 --> 00:10:33,967
Rym: Have you ever read it?

187
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,594
Scott: No, really?

188
00:10:35,614 --> 00:10:36,739
Rym: I never read it.

189
00:10:37,201 --> 00:10:39,653
Scott: I mean, I know the way never read it.

190
00:10:39,814 --> 00:10:41,040
Rym: what like you've seen it perform.

191
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:46,657
Scott: Well, I saw you know, like adaptations of it like Odyssey the you know, the cartoon or the Ducktales episode.

192
00:10:46,677 --> 00:10:47,460
Scott: That was the Odyssey.

193
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:50,544
Scott: So Claymation the Odyssey.

194
00:10:50,644 --> 00:10:54,760
Scott: actually I remember and I don't know there was a claymation that is it just made that up very much.

195
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,009
Rym: Enjoy that Ducktales one.

196
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,218
Scott: Yeah, I had that on a VHS.

197
00:10:57,641 --> 00:10:59,529
Rym: I'm just I'm really feeling I gotta watch magic.

198
00:10:59,549 --> 00:11:02,160
Scott: a dispel played the the role of Cersei.

199
00:11:03,522 --> 00:11:09,794
Rym: but anyway, and I wanted to do Historical nonfiction, but again you assholes won't read that.

200
00:11:10,316 --> 00:11:11,140
Rym: I know you won't read it.

201
00:11:11,461 --> 00:11:14,680
Rym: So I was gonna try to make some sort of like nonfiction.

202
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:23,959
Rym: But it's all pop or relevant or pot, you know, something like guns germs and steel or collapse or history of the world and whatever glass, you know that sort of thing.

203
00:11:23,979 --> 00:11:39,800
Rym: and While I really want to do that I feel like that would be better served as doing a show talking about the topics they raise as Opposed to the book because you can get this information from anywhere Mmm, and the book itself doesn't add anything other than a pop culture easy to digest version of that information.

204
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:44,179
Rym: But I wanted to do something at least literate.

205
00:11:44,446 --> 00:11:58,294
Rym: so Randomly today Scott quoted some Hess at me from Steppenwolf and I realized in that moment that while I am a fan of Hess I have never in fact read Steppenwolf and I feel stupid as a result.

206
00:11:58,514 --> 00:12:00,380
Scott: Well, it's like you can't listen.

207
00:12:00,641 --> 00:12:02,028
Rym: That's like yeah Shakespeare.

208
00:12:02,048 --> 00:12:02,993
Rym: I know all about Shakespeare.

209
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:03,415
Rym: I love him.

210
00:12:03,435 --> 00:12:03,957
Rym: Yeah, Macbeth.

211
00:12:03,978 --> 00:12:04,460
Rym: That was great.

212
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,210
Scott: You know, I've only read like three Shakespeare's maybe two.

213
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:12,300
Rym: Let me guess because everyone knows Macbeth Hamlet and maybe Richard the third.

214
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,920
Scott: No, I don't really know the story of Macbeth other than those witches.

215
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:22,460
Rym: Wow, yeah, so I take you've never seen or read all the the king ones none of them not even Richard the third.

216
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,950
Rym: You know like, you know, like even the tempest.

217
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:27,019
Scott: I don't know what the story is, but I really like the name the tempest.

218
00:12:27,523 --> 00:12:29,963
Scott: I just picture this tornado That is.

219
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:31,130
Scott: I don't know what it's about though.

220
00:12:31,231 --> 00:12:32,720
Rym: That is exactly what it's about.

221
00:12:32,861 --> 00:12:35,010
Rym: It's about a tornado that comes to town and kills everybody.

222
00:12:35,312 --> 00:12:36,316
Scott: Oh, I gotta read that right.

223
00:12:36,376 --> 00:12:37,660
Rym: taming of the shrew That's good.

224
00:12:38,242 --> 00:12:42,865
Rym: They basically going to the top of the queue they catch the shrew in the woods and they try to tame it to perform in a circus.

225
00:12:42,885 --> 00:12:45,820
Scott: I Know that's not what that's about.

226
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:49,861
Rym: Hamlet.

227
00:12:50,464 --> 00:12:53,880
Scott: I know I know Hamlet and I know the Hamlet was remade recently.

228
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,990
Rym: There is a new not the because there's a Patrick Stewart Hamlet.

229
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:57,552
Rym: That's awesome.

230
00:12:58,054 --> 00:13:00,688
Rym: But there was actually remade as a movie You might have heard of.

231
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:03,094
Rym: it was called babe Hamlet.

232
00:13:04,782 --> 00:13:10,154
Rym: So The book I'm choosing is a book that I have not read but I know is good.

233
00:13:10,174 --> 00:13:14,751
Rym: it is Steppenwolf Not the band.

234
00:13:14,771 --> 00:13:16,545
Scott: Oh Damn it.

235
00:13:16,727 --> 00:13:20,330
Rym: I Was disappointed that I. I have a bet.

236
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:20,912
Rym: I'm curious.

237
00:13:21,153 --> 00:13:21,896
Rym: I think I'll make a poll.

238
00:13:21,957 --> 00:13:28,616
Rym: I want to know Do you know Steppenwolf primarily as the book or as the band the band?

239
00:13:28,817 --> 00:13:29,900
Rym: they are both important.

240
00:13:30,882 --> 00:13:41,845
Scott: No, so I would even almost argue similarly No, I had this pile of books many of which are thanks to fade sending us too many books For Viennese too awesome.

241
00:13:41,925 --> 00:13:53,740
Scott: So, you know, I had this large unread pile and I told myself look I'm what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take all my books that are just books of words and not comic books and I'm gonna Read all of them that are unread.

242
00:13:53,800 --> 00:14:03,880
Scott: I'm not gonna buy any new ones and after that I will buy an e-book reader of some kind probably the open B-book, which can just read PDFs and is not a closed-ass Kindle type thing.

243
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:15,749
Scott: So rest recently, I just started reading and last over the past few days I read make room make room which is the book that soylent green comes from even though Soylent green is nothing.

244
00:14:15,951 --> 00:14:24,150
Rym: There's no soylent green in the book Although there is soylent in the book as the whole time Scott's reading it because I kept asking every day So is soylent green?

245
00:14:24,171 --> 00:14:29,812
Scott: people know so in that book There's no soylent green and nothing that anyone eats as people.

246
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:32,240
Scott: there's absolutely no cannibalism accidental or intentional.

247
00:14:33,866 --> 00:14:37,140
Scott: But if you read it, you'll understand why soylent green is people in the movie.

248
00:14:37,241 --> 00:14:39,100
Scott: Anyway, so the next book in the queue.

249
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:43,600
Scott: I finished that the next book in the queue is Steppenwolf and I've read like 30 pages on the train home today.

250
00:14:44,202 --> 00:14:48,039
Scott: And then there are some interesting choice bits like, you know an interesting paragraph here.

251
00:14:48,059 --> 00:15:01,020
Rym: there They were relevant to a discussion Scott and I just I just quoted them at Rym and then he was like, alright Long time listeners know that we eat that shit up anytime like that's why ghost in the shell innocence was such a great movie.

252
00:15:01,081 --> 00:15:04,676
Rym: Cuz it's just two people Quoting at each other for almost the entire movie.

253
00:15:04,797 --> 00:15:07,117
Rym: Yeah, I Love that sort of thing.

254
00:15:07,681 --> 00:15:12,880
Rym: But you know you quoted at me and suddenly the realization that I had not actually read Steppenwolf.

255
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,952
Rym: In fact, I did not even know what it was about.

256
00:15:16,474 --> 00:15:16,896
Scott: You know what?

257
00:15:17,037 --> 00:15:19,244
Scott: I've only read One point.

258
00:15:19,806 --> 00:15:24,880
Scott: one books by Hermann Hesse, which is Siddhartha and Steppenwolf is the point one, right?

259
00:15:25,621 --> 00:15:27,286
Scott: I can't name a single other thing.

260
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:28,590
Scott: that he is written Demian.

261
00:15:29,272 --> 00:15:29,934
Scott: Don't know what that is.

262
00:15:30,456 --> 00:15:37,100
Rym: Actually Demian is Nominally either the basis for or heavily influenced utenna the anime.

263
00:15:37,482 --> 00:15:43,850
Rym: You know that the whole if a chick cracks a shell that whole thing a Braxis That I've heard the word a Braxis.

264
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:44,875
Scott: Is that where that comes from?

265
00:15:44,955 --> 00:15:45,940
Rym: It's a Gnostic thing.

266
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,300
Rym: Yeah, but that that whole speech if the chick does not break its egg shell it'll die without being born.

267
00:15:51,741 --> 00:15:52,564
Rym: You know, we're the chick.

268
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:59,709
Rym: the world all that stuff is a paraphrase of something from Demian, which is a story of Adolescence, you know this.

269
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:00,474
Scott: this brings me.

270
00:16:00,494 --> 00:16:02,505
Scott: this is a great bridge If we didn't have things of the day.

271
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:05,100
Scott: in between I could make a really great connection.

272
00:16:05,502 --> 00:16:09,117
Rym: Well, let's do things of the day and then go back to that bridge before we burn it.

273
00:16:09,217 --> 00:16:09,499
Rym: All right.

274
00:16:16,463 --> 00:16:28,482
Rym: So then briefly things of the day, I'm sure many of you have seen this But in case you haven't go watch John Hodgman in his speech with Barack Obama and about Barack Obama and to Barack Obama Because

275
00:16:28,602 --> 00:16:30,348
Scott: at the correspondence dinner

276
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:43,797
Rym: it is not only hilarious and well done and you know Just right on par with what I expect from John Hodgman who I love because he more so than anyone I've seen in recent memory is the master of the straight man.

277
00:16:43,817 --> 00:16:48,454
Rym: delivery Someone actually I saw someone is difficult to tell when he is kidding.

278
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:58,812
Scott: I saw somebody ask him You know if he ever has trouble like laughing at his own stuff because he's so, you know Not laughing at his own stuff and he says he was talking about like.

279
00:16:59,133 --> 00:17:14,771
Scott: there are a few things like he has trouble not laughing And he has like hold it in because you know to keep it up, but funniness aside it is very poignant and very Biting and very relevant and it is one of those things.

280
00:17:14,872 --> 00:17:17,720
Rym: It is a barb that cannot prick the numb fingers.

281
00:17:23,681 --> 00:17:24,823
Rym: You still have to read that book.

282
00:17:25,925 --> 00:17:27,008
Scott: is that still the judging eye?

283
00:17:27,127 --> 00:17:28,210
Rym: Yes, it's still the judging eye.

284
00:17:31,821 --> 00:17:35,996
Rym: Yes, numb fingers will not be will not get this and we'll just find it funny but alright.

285
00:17:36,036 --> 00:17:37,341
Scott: so my thing is they have go ahead.

286
00:17:37,582 --> 00:17:47,168
Scott: so here is a It's just little photos of Train stations because train stations are some of the awesomest buildings in the world, especially United States.

287
00:17:47,228 --> 00:17:49,940
Rym: train stations You mean like a Penn Station in New York City?

288
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:51,086
Scott: Yes, not around anymore.

289
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:54,789
Rym: Well, yeah Well, there is a Penn Station that doesn't mean anything.

290
00:17:56,433 --> 00:17:58,710
Scott: You know, of course, that's the first one on the list, right?

291
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:09,910
Scott: and basically what it is is pictures of train stations that no longer exist and then immediately followed by a Picture of what's in the place where the train station used to exist, you know what?

292
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:10,993
Rym: you know what's really said.

293
00:18:11,374 --> 00:18:21,323
Rym: the things that are where they used to be boil down to either an empty lot a windowless 1970s era brick building usually a post office of some kind.

294
00:18:21,343 --> 00:18:23,330
Rym: Yeah, or a freeway.

295
00:18:24,352 --> 00:18:27,476
Scott: Yep See what's very place.

296
00:18:27,516 --> 00:18:28,861
Scott: good shit with bad shit.

297
00:18:28,881 --> 00:18:31,310
Rym: Well, it's down great sad on a number of levels.

298
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,230
Scott: It's like we got all this failing infrastructure.

299
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:37,590
Scott: We can upgrade but when we had quality infrastructure we downgraded.

300
00:18:37,691 --> 00:18:38,959
Rym: Well, it's sad on multiple levels.

301
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:46,090
Rym: because look in places like New York City You know, they demolished Penn Station and built another train station because they still needed a train station.

302
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:55,589
Rym: Yeah, but they bought it underground and it wasn't really that aside though But they replaced beautiful architecture with theoretically efficient architecture, even though it ended up not being efficient, but that's beside the point.

303
00:18:56,571 --> 00:18:58,469
Rym: outside of like New York City.

304
00:18:59,132 --> 00:19:04,669
Rym: Most of these examples are a train station replaced with nothing because there aren't trains anywhere else.

305
00:19:05,331 --> 00:19:14,157
Rym: Yep, that was the saddest part like all those beautiful train stations down south and out west replaced with empty lot because there are no trains Yep, or no need.

306
00:19:14,198 --> 00:19:16,570
Rym: like Rochester had an amazing train station.

307
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:17,795
Rym: It was replaced with.

308
00:19:17,996 --> 00:19:21,390
Scott: it looked a lot like the Poughkeepsie train station, which hasn't been knocked down.

309
00:19:21,691 --> 00:19:24,400
Rym: Yeah, because it's used by Metro North and Amtrak.

310
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:27,210
Rym: Yep, but I mean you've seen the Amtrak station in Rochester.

311
00:19:27,331 --> 00:19:29,540
Rym: It's basically just a low like.

312
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,303
Scott: well see that's the thing.

313
00:19:30,344 --> 00:19:31,087
Scott: I don't get right.

314
00:19:31,127 --> 00:19:31,830
Scott: is that in Rochester?

315
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:35,370
Scott: Why do they knock that one down if they replaced it with an Amtrak station?

316
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:39,510
Scott: It's like you would rather have that dank ass like Amtrak station.

317
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:45,510
Scott: That might as well be a Greyhound stop lower maintenance as opposed to the fancy awesome station that you had already.

318
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:50,330
Rym: The saddest one is still for me the Grand Central Station in Michigan, Michigan.

319
00:19:50,611 --> 00:19:56,071
Rym: So there though it is but if there's no way that there's no way that's gonna be kept in detour There's.

320
00:19:56,996 --> 00:19:59,268
Rym: I am almost certain that it will not last.

321
00:19:59,288 --> 00:20:02,880
Rym: yeah Less I I saw it once.

322
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,870
Rym: well now I've only actually seen it in big.

323
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:13,290
Scott: This is why I should be a rich person with enough money because I would make all my buildings as awesome as old train stations I would never make like the boring-ass buildings people make today.

324
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:16,177
Rym: Well, the thing is what I didn't realize.

325
00:20:16,237 --> 00:20:21,210
Rym: Michigan Central Station was designed by the same people who made Grand Central in New York.

326
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,722
Scott: Well, there aren't too many train station designers really.

327
00:20:24,145 --> 00:20:24,748
Scott: I mean there's not.

328
00:20:24,768 --> 00:20:33,941
Rym: it's not like Grand Central and then they use like the same design principles in Michigan Because that used to be a very maintain the constellation theme.

329
00:20:35,065 --> 00:20:35,426
Rym: I don't know.

330
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:36,710
Scott: Yeah, that's that's key.

331
00:20:37,692 --> 00:20:38,477
Rym: It said yeah.

332
00:20:38,497 --> 00:20:40,569
Rym: All right, so resume your bridge.

333
00:20:41,511 --> 00:20:42,817
Scott: What was my bridge right?

334
00:20:42,837 --> 00:20:45,609
Scott: So recently, you know, we were talking about like a Braxis.

335
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,410
Scott: now I said I didn't know what that meant, right?

336
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:53,390
Scott: Well recently, I've sort of been getting on a kick of sort of whenever something comes up that I don't know what it is.

337
00:20:53,791 --> 00:21:00,735
Scott: I've been taking double diligence in going to research it on the Internet's, you know, just like, you know learn about Whatever like.

338
00:21:00,755 --> 00:21:02,926
Scott: because you know, someone mentions a famous person.

339
00:21:02,987 --> 00:21:03,610
Scott: I don't know who it is.

340
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:08,697
Scott: I look it up now instead of just going out on who that is, you know I mean like some famous person.

341
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:09,481
Scott: I work at Broadway.

342
00:21:09,722 --> 00:21:11,670
Scott: calm now some famous person came in the office.

343
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:16,630
Scott: I didn't know who it was, you know that people were making a hubbub and I was like, oh, but I looked them up.

344
00:21:16,891 --> 00:21:19,244
Scott: That didn't really help me understand why they were famous.

345
00:21:19,305 --> 00:21:19,787
Scott: But you know.

346
00:21:21,491 --> 00:21:24,359
Scott: But anyway, so, you know some people in the office.

347
00:21:24,379 --> 00:21:38,510
Scott: they were talking about some, you know reality shows something something's you know how they do and You know I sort of remembered this old show that was like is one of those shows Back in the day where you'd be watching the show you cared about.

348
00:21:38,912 --> 00:21:42,330
Scott: It would be over then this other show would come on and then you would turn it off.

349
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:48,149
Scott: But you would always see the beginning of that show or maybe you'd see the end of it because he was on before the show That you actually wanted to watch.

350
00:21:48,298 --> 00:21:54,110
Rym: Yep I would always see the end or beginning of Friends because they sandwich the shows I liked with friends when I was in high school.

351
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:56,397
Scott: So I'm like earlier this week, right?

352
00:21:56,477 --> 00:22:01,010
Scott: I was you know, I remembered I like hey wasn't there that show like star search?

353
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:04,743
Scott: That was a talent show and I was like these new reality shows.

354
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:06,630
Scott: a lot of them are just like that show.

355
00:22:06,991 --> 00:22:08,118
Scott: Are they just ripping that off?

356
00:22:08,701 --> 00:22:10,249
Scott: Let me go find out about that show.

357
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:14,765
Scott: So I went to find out about that show and it was hosted by Ed McMahon.

358
00:22:14,805 --> 00:22:15,247
Scott: so I went.

359
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,810
Scott: I'm like, oh, yeah There's all these guys named McMahon.

360
00:22:18,373 --> 00:22:20,905
Scott: Let me sort all them out because I don't know which one is which.

361
00:22:20,925 --> 00:22:26,690
Scott: and I found out you know Like Vince McMahon was the wrestling guy and Ed McMahon was the guy in the Johnny Carson show and star search, you know.

362
00:22:27,391 --> 00:22:32,394
Scott: And then the next day Ed McMahon died and I was like, whoa Gotta call Randy Scott.

363
00:22:32,575 --> 00:22:34,019
Rym: You'd better stop looking people up.

364
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:35,543
Rym: Don't go to your own Wikipedia page.

365
00:22:35,764 --> 00:22:36,065
Scott: Fuck.

366
00:22:36,586 --> 00:22:39,749
Scott: I know right good thing I don't have a Wikipedia page for Scott Rubin.

367
00:22:41,054 --> 00:22:45,519
Scott: Now you could But yeah, that was uh, that was a little bit weird.

368
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:52,758
Scott: Obviously, it is not psychic or any way supernatural It is mere coincidence But well part of it is freaky regardless.

369
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:56,950
Rym: part of it in general is that every generation goes through the phase where?

370
00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:02,030
Rym: Their heroes and the institutions in their lives disappear because the world changes.

371
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,255
Rym: I mean when you're young.

372
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:08,779
Rym: most of the people you look up to most of people you see in the media that sort of thing Are a lot older than you.

373
00:23:08,819 --> 00:23:10,530
Rym: they're like the current successful generation.

374
00:23:11,152 --> 00:23:12,136
Rym: They start dying.

375
00:23:12,156 --> 00:23:14,505
Scott: if you're like a little kid like three years old, right?

376
00:23:14,545 --> 00:23:15,408
Scott: Let's say you're watching.

377
00:23:15,569 --> 00:23:18,455
Scott: I don't know The busy town right.

378
00:23:18,676 --> 00:23:22,488
Scott: the girl with the pink hair is a lot old easy town lazy time.

379
00:23:22,548 --> 00:23:23,070
Rym: No one's busy.

380
00:23:23,311 --> 00:23:26,029
Scott: Oh, no, Richard scary is is busy town is there you go?

381
00:23:26,251 --> 00:23:31,143
Scott: I don't know anyway, but if you're watching lazy town right that girl with the pink hair She's older than you.

382
00:23:31,163 --> 00:23:39,590
Rym: if you're in preschool So, you know, but right when you hit your like late 20s early 30s is when all the institutions of your life start dying.

383
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:44,809
Rym: Yep, either physically dying or disappearing from the media landscape.

384
00:23:45,191 --> 00:23:46,797
Rym: Mm-hmm, and both are.

385
00:23:47,339 --> 00:23:47,902
Rym: it's kind of this.

386
00:23:48,243 --> 00:24:04,129
Rym: I don't want to say coming of age, you know We were just talking about Stefan wolf and Herman s and all that But it's definitely a one of those rights that all Generations go through is your heroes all start dying and you reach the age where you realize that All my heroes are dying and then I'm going to die.

387
00:24:04,532 --> 00:24:07,970
Scott: Well, it's sort of weird because it's almost like this is it's almost three parts, right?

388
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:14,570
Scott: The first part is you're born and you have all these sort of people that are already dead.

389
00:24:15,234 --> 00:24:16,140
Scott: You know like Elvis.

390
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,629
Scott: Elvis was dead before I was born.

391
00:24:18,111 --> 00:24:21,121
Scott: So, you know the it was sort of like Elvis.

392
00:24:21,662 --> 00:24:24,130
Scott: then it's almost like he's not even a real person.

393
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:38,307
Scott: He's almost like, you know a mythical and legendary Type figure effectively no different than you know Gandalf or You know Luke Skywalker really, you know because he was never alive at the same time.

394
00:24:38,408 --> 00:24:39,030
Scott: I was alive.

395
00:24:39,231 --> 00:24:40,454
Scott: So it's just he's a legend.

396
00:24:41,076 --> 00:24:45,169
Scott: and then you have the people who you know, like Michael Jackson who you know.

397
00:24:45,752 --> 00:24:47,781
Scott: I was a fan of Michael Jackson when I was young.

398
00:24:47,801 --> 00:24:52,398
Scott: and now that I'm old, you know He's dead and it's it's kind of weird.

399
00:24:52,438 --> 00:25:05,155
Scott: and then there's the people who are like they come up You know after you and you're like you're like who the fuck are these people trying to be someone else's, you know famous person Stupid kids who they looking

400
00:25:05,235 --> 00:25:28,463
Rym: at because I think that's another component of people grow old and you know to people who grew up in the 80s and the early 90s, you know, you look back and you remember Michael Jackson primarily as Possibly one of the greatest entertainers to have ever lived One of the biggest stars ever and you think thriller people not that much younger than you will look and think oh That's that crazy pedophile guy, right?

401
00:25:28,948 --> 00:25:31,843
Scott: Yep If you you know, cuz when do they see thriller?

402
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:32,988
Scott: maybe on YouTube once?

403
00:25:33,129 --> 00:25:34,597
Rym: Yeah But what do they see all the time?

404
00:25:34,617 --> 00:25:36,710
Rym: the current fat Elvis in the media?

405
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:37,772
Scott: Yeah, isn't that?

406
00:25:37,972 --> 00:25:45,155
Scott: there's a lot of parallels and weird connections, you know, I'm not getting all conspiracy not in this episode You know me But I mean look at it right.

407
00:25:45,195 --> 00:25:49,250
Scott: first of all Michael Jackson for a time married Elvis Presley's daughter, right?

408
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,229
Scott: weird enough.

409
00:25:51,297 --> 00:26:01,039
Scott: number two Michael Jackson and Elvis were both like the two kings of music in the United States Pretty much one and two, you know time for first

410
00:26:01,139 --> 00:26:04,610
Rym: Kennedy had a secretary named Lincoln and right and had a secretary named

411
00:26:05,851 --> 00:26:17,210
Scott: anyway, and they both died early relatively early early and they were supposed to and they both had sort of this dual career of the Early part where they were awesome in the later part where they were less awesome.

412
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:24,420
Scott: You know, there's always young Elvis and fat Elvis and there's young Michael Jackson Who is the king of pop and there's old Michael Jackson?

413
00:26:24,441 --> 00:26:34,755
Scott: It was a scary pedophile and it's like wow Alleged yes, the estate can still sue that's true alleged pedophile But even so it's.

414
00:26:34,875 --> 00:26:45,030
Scott: you know, those parallels are very weird and you wonder if there is you know Something behind that like if there is a third king of music will that person also follow a similar pattern?

415
00:26:45,591 --> 00:26:48,338
Rym: Well, I think it's tricky that it's very.

416
00:26:48,418 --> 00:26:57,163
Rym: it's almost impossible for someone who has a high level of output to maintain a High level of consistently good output for the entirety of their life.

417
00:26:57,203 --> 00:26:57,986
Rym: people live 60 70 80 90 years.

418
00:26:59,170 --> 00:26:59,452
Scott: You know what?

419
00:26:59,472 --> 00:27:01,245
Scott: I realized just the other day.

420
00:27:01,285 --> 00:27:01,910
Rym: What'd you realize?

421
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:09,030
Scott: Well, Tezuka probably had the highest quantity of output right above just about any crater I can think of almost right.

422
00:27:09,393 --> 00:27:10,769
Scott: But he had some duds.

423
00:27:11,733 --> 00:27:18,097
Scott: We know this Cleopatra queen of sex, you know ambassador magma All right, so Tezuka is not perfect.

424
00:27:18,739 --> 00:27:22,190
Scott: Hayao Miyazaki has not had the prolific miss of Tezuka.

425
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:25,561
Scott: He has never done anything bad Ever.

426
00:27:25,702 --> 00:27:26,249
Scott: he's perfect.

427
00:27:26,934 --> 00:27:29,650
Rym: You know, there's this tiny conspiracy not chance, right?

428
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:34,870
Rym: That he has made like five other movies and he shows him to the rest of the studio.

429
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:38,363
Rym: They knock him out they burn them and they pretend.

430
00:27:38,403 --> 00:27:44,263
Scott: I discussed I discussed this with Daryl Surratt and other people and we have decided that there are two possibilities.

431
00:27:44,303 --> 00:27:46,550
Scott: number one Miyazaki truly is perfect.

432
00:27:47,436 --> 00:27:49,634
Scott: number two He actually knows.

433
00:27:49,654 --> 00:27:52,081
Scott: he can tell what's good and what's bad after he makes it.

434
00:27:52,442 --> 00:27:57,754
Scott: and there's a secret trove of all the unreleased not so good Miyazaki's that we need to go.

435
00:27:57,774 --> 00:27:58,316
Rym: number three.

436
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:02,070
Rym: He is also going a guy and that is how he releases everything else.

437
00:28:05,611 --> 00:28:12,410
Scott: No, but I mean, you know Miyazaki's an old dude, he'll be you know dead in 30 years or less probably most likely.

438
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:15,685
Rym: I really feel like he is destined to die in the midst of his latest work.

439
00:28:15,946 --> 00:28:16,850
Scott: Oh, probably he's keen.

440
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:17,271
Scott: Oh, he's the.

441
00:28:17,291 --> 00:28:18,094
Scott: he's one of those guys.

442
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:18,516
Scott: He's like.

443
00:28:18,556 --> 00:28:19,419
Scott: he's like Brett Favre.

444
00:28:19,659 --> 00:28:20,402
Scott: I'm retiring.

445
00:28:20,663 --> 00:28:21,285
Scott: Just kidding.

446
00:28:21,526 --> 00:28:22,248
Scott: I'm retiring.

447
00:28:22,288 --> 00:28:24,017
Scott: Just kidding I'm gonna play another season.

448
00:28:24,561 --> 00:28:25,769
Scott: That's Miyazaki right there.

449
00:28:27,157 --> 00:28:32,063
Rym: so Yeah, so Farrah Fawcett and Michael Jackson and Ava Gota died.

450
00:28:32,504 --> 00:28:34,994
Scott: not Ava Gota Ed McMahon Does anyone?

451
00:28:35,035 --> 00:28:38,010
Rym: even the Ava Gota joke is old enough to where I know this.

452
00:28:38,291 --> 00:28:43,832
Scott: I know the Ava Gota is a famous guy and I know that there's a joke about him being dead and he's not dead You don't know.

453
00:28:43,892 --> 00:28:46,960
Rym: famous for a famous for not being dead.

454
00:28:47,161 --> 00:28:47,622
Scott: That's it.

455
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:49,787
Rym: He was famous for something.

456
00:28:50,088 --> 00:28:51,332
Rym: It was the 70s I don't know.

457
00:28:51,352 --> 00:28:52,797
Rym: All right, maybe even the late 60s.

458
00:28:52,937 --> 00:28:56,810
Rym: All I know is that someone reported that he was dead.

459
00:28:57,052 --> 00:29:07,009
Rym: They basically they had some news story and you know His career faded at this point and some guy on TV some talk show said something to the effect of bla bla bla bla the late Ava Gota.

460
00:29:08,131 --> 00:29:09,336
Scott: Were they joking?

461
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:10,419
Rym: They just they thought he was dead.

462
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,290
Rym: Yeah, he wasn't perfectly fine.

463
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:16,117
Scott: But hey, I'm zombie.

464
00:29:16,178 --> 00:29:16,639
Scott: Ava Gota.

465
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:25,157
Rym: based on the image based on the comments on FARC I don't think anyone who posted a picture of Ava Gota Even knows that much.

466
00:29:25,719 --> 00:29:30,194
Rym: I think they just know to post a picture of Ava Gota every time someone dies Really?

467
00:29:30,555 --> 00:29:37,566
Rym: I don't think they know in any capacity and I'm not kidding All right putting that on a list after show Wikipedia Ava Gota.

468
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:42,405
Rym: All right All right, luckily at least I knew who Farrah Fawcett and Michael Jackson were.

469
00:29:42,425 --> 00:29:43,850
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

470
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:48,330
Scott: It's always strange when a famous person dies because it's you know, you have that sort of situation.

471
00:29:48,491 --> 00:29:58,512
Scott: I mean, I've sort of seen a microcosm of this situation with our fans and that you know and also being a fan of other internet peoples in that you Consume.

472
00:29:58,652 --> 00:30:06,750
Scott: so, you know you you consume someone's works or you know You listen to them or you see them a great deal and thus you sort of feel like you know them.

473
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:07,554
Scott: You don't really know them.

474
00:30:07,594 --> 00:30:11,994
Scott: You know, they're this show of them, you know, this this Of them.

475
00:30:12,336 --> 00:30:18,542
Rym: even though it's one-way communication for the most part you still you generate this Feeling like you know the person.

476
00:30:18,562 --> 00:30:24,050
Rym: I mean, I'll admit I've done that I've listened to enough of the penny arcade podcast that I feel like I'm in the room hanging out with them.

477
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:24,979
Rym: But they don't know who I am.

478
00:30:24,999 --> 00:30:25,929
Scott: They don't know who you are at all.

479
00:30:28,572 --> 00:30:31,370
Scott: Maybe twice for ten seconds each if you say saw you on the street.

480
00:30:32,534 --> 00:30:34,982
Rym: Everyone who runs PAX knows us, but they don't.

481
00:30:35,463 --> 00:30:37,510
Scott: yeah, but anyway, they don't let on that they do.

482
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:40,324
Scott: Maybe that maybe they got this elaborate elaborate scheme.

483
00:30:40,364 --> 00:30:41,510
Scott: It's conspiracy theory night here.

484
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:45,605
Rym: Well, one thing I can say is that they like D&D for all the wrong reasons.

485
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:46,589
Scott: That's for sure.

486
00:30:47,432 --> 00:30:48,283
Scott: question about it.

487
00:30:49,891 --> 00:30:52,479
Scott: Yeah, but it's like someone like a famous person dies.

488
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,401
Scott: It's so weird.

489
00:30:53,461 --> 00:30:56,270
Scott: It's like I don't know this person but I care.

490
00:30:56,773 --> 00:30:58,645
Scott: But really I don't know them at all.

491
00:30:58,685 --> 00:30:59,470
Scott: Why do I care?

492
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:01,496
Scott: And it's it's sort of I don't know.

493
00:31:01,556 --> 00:31:02,541
Scott: at least that's what I feel.

494
00:31:02,601 --> 00:31:04,350
Scott: It's like it's sort of strange.

495
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:08,425
Scott: It's like I shouldn't care but I should and there's plenty of people dying who aren't famous.

496
00:31:08,465 --> 00:31:14,585
Scott: that I don't know and I probably should Care more about them because they're probably actually more important in the actual scheme of the world.

497
00:31:14,605 --> 00:31:15,869
Scott: I don't know.

498
00:31:16,871 --> 00:31:17,694
Scott: it's sort of fucked up.

499
00:31:18,196 --> 00:31:34,603
Rym: one thing I do wonder though is how because I feel like the internet and the democratization of Publishing is gonna change this as time goes on because the internet is a weird situation and that Anything like something large enough like penny arcade you would find out.

500
00:31:34,663 --> 00:31:48,142
Rym: but for smaller things like a medium-sized webcomic Or like gig nights, you know that sort of thing if something happens and the person making that content dies Very it's very likely that you might never find out what happened.

501
00:31:48,182 --> 00:31:51,654
Rym: It just stops updating the website goes away and The fans.

502
00:31:52,215 --> 00:32:02,890
Scott: I don't know about that because if you look at what's been happening on the internet's right even like people who are just members of Communities, you know like so they're on some forum and that's their internet presence.

503
00:32:03,031 --> 00:32:04,220
Scott: Is there a member of this forum?

504
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,388
Scott: and they post kind of often?

505
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:09,261
Scott: When they die people find out and call and everything is.

506
00:32:09,361 --> 00:32:17,950
Rym: the thing is though it's this it's more diffuse in that There's no way to find out directly usually but then indirect sources will come out, but there will never be news coverage.

507
00:32:18,132 --> 00:32:25,770
Rym: It's just word-of-mouth mmm, and That sort of thing also just in terms of you know, how rapidly the news comes out.

508
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:32,210
Rym: I remember way back when I was hanging out in the computer club in sixth or seventh grade in my middle school.

509
00:32:32,552 --> 00:32:33,781
Rym: You know, I didn't have a computer at home yet.

510
00:32:33,821 --> 00:32:35,010
Rym: I was not a good computer.

511
00:32:35,311 --> 00:32:39,310
Rym: So I'm hanging out there playing scorch and the guy who ran the computer lab was this kind of techie guy.

512
00:32:39,411 --> 00:32:52,863
Rym: he read FARC all the time and that sort of thing and Well the FARC equivalents of that time at least yeah, and he just kind of pipes up and says Wow, John Candy just died and There wasn't a news story about that for another day.

513
00:32:52,884 --> 00:32:59,770
Rym: Wow Or when Princess Diana died in that car accident you told the story Yeah, but my parents did not believe me.

514
00:32:59,971 --> 00:33:03,404
Rym: They thought I was making stuff up because how could I know how could I have possibly known that?

515
00:33:03,525 --> 00:33:04,830
Scott: well times are definitely changing?

516
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:11,325
Scott: because I was on the train home and People were saying up my Jackson's head is that on the train.

517
00:33:11,365 --> 00:33:16,910
Scott: so people on the train They all knew what the score was on their cell phones or whatever.

518
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:21,970
Rym: So because it's no longer just the people who go to places like FARC find out now, it's you know Twitter.

519
00:33:22,772 --> 00:33:29,530
Scott: Yeah, I mean basically I saw on Twitter that it was like, you know heart attack something coma something dead.

520
00:33:29,651 --> 00:33:30,415
Scott: No, not dead.

521
00:33:30,455 --> 00:33:31,702
Scott: Yes dead not dead.

522
00:33:31,742 --> 00:33:36,082
Scott: And then by the time I got home It was like, you know on the radio they were like dead dead.

523
00:33:36,444 --> 00:33:37,167
Scott: So that was that.

524
00:33:37,187 --> 00:33:43,749
Rym: Yep It was interesting how it was one of those things that came out of nowhere as opposed to the kind of expected celebrity death.

525
00:33:44,512 --> 00:33:46,680
Rym: Mmm, I mean that it was not what I expected at all.

526
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,282
Rym: Farrah Fawcett.

527
00:33:47,322 --> 00:33:49,430
Rym: Everyone knew was kind of she wasn't doing well.

528
00:33:50,152 --> 00:33:51,858
Scott: Yeah, there's another weird thing right?

529
00:33:51,898 --> 00:33:55,610
Scott: It's like people have been talking about, you know, okay, so Michael Jackson died.

530
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:57,257
Scott: Well, sorry for Farrah Fawcett.

531
00:33:57,318 --> 00:34:04,350
Scott: No one's gonna pay attention to her now and it really shows you that Really the attention economy is becoming more and more important.

532
00:34:04,491 --> 00:34:05,033
Scott: It's like didn't?

533
00:34:05,113 --> 00:34:05,696
Rym: didn't?

534
00:34:05,756 --> 00:34:07,665
Rym: John Henson and Jim Henson?

535
00:34:07,685 --> 00:34:09,232
Rym: Jim Henson a god I don't know who.

536
00:34:09,272 --> 00:34:11,801
Rym: John Henson and Sammy Davis jr.

537
00:34:11,821 --> 00:34:12,583
Rym: Die in the same day.

538
00:34:12,704 --> 00:34:14,210
Scott: Someone said that I don't know if it's true.

539
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:14,713
Scott: I had to look it up.

540
00:34:14,773 --> 00:34:17,085
Rym: Multiple people said that it's been said a bunch today.

541
00:34:17,126 --> 00:34:19,534
Rym: I saw it on FARC I saw it on Wikipedia.

542
00:34:19,856 --> 00:34:21,321
Rym: I saw it in our forums.

543
00:34:21,341 --> 00:34:23,969
Rym: All right, I can't verify the veracity of that at all.

544
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,661
Scott: But yeah, you know what?

545
00:34:25,702 --> 00:34:26,306
Rym: I'll verify.

546
00:34:26,347 --> 00:34:33,330
Scott: right now It's like look something happens right and there's a certain amount of you know interest and talk discussion about it, right?

547
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:52,879
Scott: But if something else happens at the same time Right and thought and if that means that the other thing is gonna get less discussion or it's gonna be less Spread or less paid attention to I mean that means that we sort of you know our new limited resource in the world of today the Internet's world is attention.

548
00:34:52,899 --> 00:35:00,396
Scott: and You know, I mean people sort of knew this and people have been talking about you know the the attention economy and these sorts of things.

549
00:35:00,436 --> 00:35:06,958
Scott: but really it's I think it's gonna be a lot bigger deal than people really really expect at all.

550
00:35:07,419 --> 00:35:14,700
Scott: and You know how much attention people give to various things is really what's gonna make a difference in the long run.

551
00:35:15,462 --> 00:35:20,260
Rym: Well, I mean if you go fully out, you know the maximum fully extended scenario.

552
00:35:20,844 --> 00:35:26,019
Rym: Eventually humanity if it doesn't get wiped out We'll have basically infinite energy resources and that sort of.

553
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:27,042
Rym: you know Diamond Age stuff.

554
00:35:27,824 --> 00:35:36,679
Rym: if all physical desires can be provided trivially the only commodity left on earth is fame Mmm, I guess.

555
00:35:37,643 --> 00:35:40,179
Scott: But even then, you know, even that could dissolve.

556
00:35:41,341 --> 00:35:47,613
Rym: Well, it could if we had changed some sort of super sentience to the point where we're omnisciently aware of all Communication at all times.

557
00:35:47,996 --> 00:35:55,796
Scott: and well Fame is a product of our culture of you know, people being social with each other.

558
00:35:55,877 --> 00:36:01,693
Scott: and if we could have some sort of You know post social society, it would be all fucked up.

559
00:36:01,933 --> 00:36:04,060
Scott: Then, you know, there would be no fame.

560
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:13,089
Rym: Well, I fame or immortality or that sort of desire is definitely something that is deeply ingrained in humanity Definitely a biological thing, you know.

561
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:15,679
Scott: right next to you know, just the desire to have friends.

562
00:36:17,081 --> 00:36:19,468
Scott: But you know, well Maslow's pyramid.

563
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:34,770
Scott: Yeah, but you know many other biological things You know are being you know in conflict with our society and you know Eventually, all of them will be or you know, just a matter of time All right.

564
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:43,518
Rym: Yep, so That can be summed up as in the long run things will change everything will change It's no matter what.

565
00:36:45,361 --> 00:36:49,454
Scott: Yeah, no, but something, you know specific about the Michael Jackson death.

566
00:36:49,514 --> 00:37:04,100
Scott: that's sort of weird is that you know You've got this huge Variety of comments about it because Michael Jackson was sort of you know, these multiple people I mean Elvis, you know, I said there was young Elvis and fat Elvis, but you know people liked old fat Elvis, too.

567
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,813
Scott: He wasn't a bad guy, you know, even though he liked to eat a lot and such.

568
00:37:08,234 --> 00:37:14,654
Rym: Well Park was this mix of sadness praise Gallows humor and too soon humor.

569
00:37:14,955 --> 00:37:19,013
Scott: Yeah, and Well, yeah too soon is I think there.

570
00:37:19,053 --> 00:37:20,560
Scott: I don't think there's a too soon anymore.

571
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:25,031
Scott: Everything's that FDR's everything from now on from here to eternity.

572
00:37:25,091 --> 00:37:25,973
Scott: Everything is immediate.

573
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:32,260
Scott: There's no too soon anymore, but the You know Michael Jackson, he was like these multiple people, right?

574
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:32,686
Scott: It was.

575
00:37:32,828 --> 00:37:42,411
Scott: it was you know He was a kid who a performer who everyone sort of loved even though he had some troubles in those days in the family and such He was you know, the king of pop.

576
00:37:42,491 --> 00:37:51,858
Scott: and then he was a alleged You know sort of scary freaky dude who people really didn't like and you know didn't really entertain nearly at all.

577
00:37:53,496 --> 00:37:59,262
Scott: and You know that most recently he was the not so good and not so well-loved Person.

578
00:37:59,764 --> 00:38:06,787
Scott: so, you know when people think of that person being dead, you know, some of them are kind of like oh well You know, maybe you could say good.

579
00:38:07,008 --> 00:38:18,519
Scott: maybe if you could say good about you know Someone, you know, if he really was a nasty pedophile as was alleged then you you know, some people might Think that that was a good thing.

580
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,329
Scott: That's such a person was no longer around.

581
00:38:20,389 --> 00:38:22,600
Scott: but you know you think about the king of pop died.

582
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:26,570
Scott: You know if he had died in like the 80s It would have been like the worst thing in the entire universe.

583
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:29,020
Scott: It would be like no one would have said anything bad whatsoever.

584
00:38:29,701 --> 00:38:32,273
Scott: Everyone would have been like, oh my god is the worst thing ever.

585
00:38:32,313 --> 00:38:33,660
Scott: So you think about that person dying?

586
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:37,455
Rym: It's like ah, but in a way well, that would have been more like John Lennon's death.

587
00:38:37,555 --> 00:38:42,958
Scott: Yeah, but in a way Did not that person die, you know sort of in the 90s.

588
00:38:44,241 --> 00:38:45,645
Scott: Well, you can think about it that way.

589
00:38:45,665 --> 00:38:53,915
Rym: that's that's the real crux of this that celebrities on any level from you know The you know D list celebrities like us all the way up to real celebrities.

590
00:38:53,935 --> 00:38:54,879
Scott: I think we're on the cue list.

591
00:38:55,382 --> 00:38:57,533
Rym: We're at least F at this point.

592
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:58,619
Scott: I don't know about that.

593
00:39:00,082 --> 00:39:09,527
Rym: We're still a couple of steps under I think the F list or the big podcast not the little ones, but there's the Persona of the celebrity.

594
00:39:09,949 --> 00:39:13,298
Rym: that is in and of itself and it's a real entity.

595
00:39:13,378 --> 00:39:13,880
Rym: It's out there.

596
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,363
Rym: Yeah, well, that's.

597
00:39:14,625 --> 00:39:19,860
Scott: that's why you can be like an Elvis fan Even though he died before you were born because his persona is alive.

598
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:26,159
Rym: But it if he isn't but like in perfect blue or like in super dimensional space fortress macross.

599
00:39:26,279 --> 00:39:32,173
Rym: Oh shit Yeah The media persona is as real as a real person.

600
00:39:32,213 --> 00:39:40,939
Rym: for the majority of people it effectively is a real person But yet it's not a real person that it can have a life completely independent of the person who created it.

601
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:52,186
Rym: Mmm, and we're going to see a much more interesting dichotomy there when you know, the Hatsune Miku's start becoming Good enough to where they are pop culture mainstream.

602
00:39:52,246 --> 00:39:56,523
Scott: How'd you make who came out with the new album and It's like on the charts.

603
00:39:56,965 --> 00:39:57,225
Rym: Yeah.

604
00:39:57,245 --> 00:39:58,589
Rym: Well think about that.

605
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:02,560
Rym: We're going to get to the point to where there are celebrities who cannot die.

606
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:04,002
Scott: That's true.

607
00:40:04,644 --> 00:40:05,567
Rym: what will that do?

608
00:40:05,647 --> 00:40:06,810
Scott: Well, we also right.

609
00:40:07,031 --> 00:40:13,000
Rym: I think that that moment when we get to the point to where Institutions and celebrities do not die.

610
00:40:13,642 --> 00:40:34,960
Rym: we are going to have a fundamental subtle but profound shift in society because a Right of passage that we have had from the dawn of civilization of your heroes dying will disappear and you will be able to if you were a fan of Michael Jackson imagine if you could Continually listen to Michael Jackson making the pop and lock music and everything that you loved for your entire life.

611
00:40:35,562 --> 00:40:37,670
Rym: It's very easy for people to get stuck in ruts then.

612
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:38,432
Rym: Mmm.

613
00:40:38,493 --> 00:40:52,033
Rym: I think the deaths of celebrities either spiritually philosophically physically it doesn't matter how but the the changing of that persona the loss of one thing and the Forcibly you have to forcibly move on to some other thing.

614
00:40:52,053 --> 00:40:54,240
Rym: I think losing that is gonna change society.

615
00:40:54,781 --> 00:40:56,146
Scott: Also think about this right.

616
00:40:56,246 --> 00:41:03,650
Scott: we talked about how like on the internet like you're not actually on the internet your biology You know biological entities is in the real world.

617
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,095
Rym: Well, the internet is just the surrogate.

618
00:41:05,115 --> 00:41:06,280
Rym: so it's not physical, right?

619
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:12,360
Scott: But there's like, you know, there's this data this set of data the set of information that is you it's it's you know.

620
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,880
Scott: That data combined is your identity in a way, right?

621
00:41:16,301 --> 00:41:20,660
Scott: So even if you die, that's all still there now if you think about this, right?

622
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:31,439
Scott: Compared to say, you know, John Lennon who you know had a great deal of content produced of him and about him in his day compared to other people of his day.

623
00:41:32,263 --> 00:41:40,255
Scott: Even so there is probably a greater quantity of data That is me on the internet than there is, you know unique stuff.

624
00:41:40,295 --> 00:41:41,500
Scott: That is John Lennon.

625
00:41:41,721 --> 00:41:49,800
Scott: Yeah, I mean sure there's more pages about him But in terms of just you know, he total information that is him, you know, like videos of him.

626
00:41:50,101 --> 00:41:51,746
Scott: So there's only so much so here.

627
00:41:51,766 --> 00:42:02,163
Rym: to consider this with the whole virtual performers thing and the media kind of I'm trying to come up with a new word other than just avatar or you know Surrogate.

628
00:42:02,243 --> 00:42:03,369
Rym: have you read I doru?

629
00:42:03,389 --> 00:42:05,038
Rym: you don't know you should read it.

630
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:05,924
Rym: It talks about.

631
00:42:05,945 --> 00:42:07,840
Scott: I have a feeling that book is very relevant to this guy.

632
00:42:08,201 --> 00:42:16,158
Rym: But that extent information of you the performer and and by performer, I mean just the things you did on the internet.

633
00:42:16,258 --> 00:42:28,940
Rym: Mm-hmm The technology will exist to take that and Emulate your persona as it was on the internet and basically allow you to live forever on the internet without any.

634
00:42:29,484 --> 00:42:31,602
Scott: Yeah, I mean it's it's a second If you want.

635
00:42:31,622 --> 00:42:34,352
Rym: it is straight up a second-order simulacrum ghost in the shell.

636
00:42:34,412 --> 00:42:37,673
Rym: It is a it is a self replicating Pointer.

637
00:42:37,917 --> 00:42:41,348
Scott: Yes If you wanted to make me right?

638
00:42:41,368 --> 00:42:42,712
Scott: Well, you probably couldn't make me.

639
00:42:42,732 --> 00:42:45,820
Rym: I would make a bot that post anger into a farm.

640
00:42:47,301 --> 00:42:49,528
Scott: If you wanted to make me right you probably couldn't.

641
00:42:49,809 --> 00:43:14,506
Scott: but if you wanted to make me the host of GeekNights right, you could take every GeekNights episode as sort of your data for the machine to learn from and With that data you could you know get a program that would learn it to be Scott the host of GeekNights and that that is a very very real and probably could even be done in a very near future Technological possibility.

642
00:43:14,546 --> 00:43:23,660
Rym: we're going to live in a world to where media personas Independent of the people that created them can outlive the people who created them and live forever.

643
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:27,813
Rym: hmm That is going to destroy things.

644
00:43:28,496 --> 00:43:29,340
Rym: I don't know what that's gonna do.

645
00:43:29,601 --> 00:43:39,612
Scott: I really do you think that you know, this sort of goes back into like, you know the fact that you know People are you know, not so caring about the celebrity deaths.

646
00:43:39,632 --> 00:43:46,838
Scott: Do you think that might be because you know, there's just so much You know material left over by the celebrities that it's like they're not really gone?

647
00:43:47,401 --> 00:43:50,292
Scott: You know, I mean like, you know, you'd be more upset.

648
00:43:50,312 --> 00:43:52,200
Rym: there isn't new material being created.

649
00:43:52,260 --> 00:44:01,788
Rym: I mean there aren't more thrillers exactly, but we will live in a world where there will be more thrillers forever Mm-hmm to where it won't even take effort.

650
00:44:01,849 --> 00:44:02,711
Rym: It will just happen.

651
00:44:03,313 --> 00:44:05,480
Scott: So does that contribute to the people caring less?

652
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:10,325
Scott: I mean, you know, it seems you know, like back in the day You know a lot more people.

653
00:44:10,646 --> 00:44:27,900
Rym: or will the rumbling of society and just the information we create on the internet in the course of our lives and the course of striving for Consuming and creating media as a whole converge into the perfect Idol the perfect celebrity that is the aspirations of every human on earth simultaneously?

654
00:44:29,521 --> 00:44:36,552
Rym: That's a problem which is you know, again super dimensional space fortress macross Not really, but similar.

655
00:44:36,693 --> 00:44:37,939
Rym: I think it leads to the same end.

656
00:44:39,083 --> 00:44:43,265
Scott: Plus it's completely different Yet also the same.

657
00:44:43,406 --> 00:44:44,490
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

658
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:50,704
