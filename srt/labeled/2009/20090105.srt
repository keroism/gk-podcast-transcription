1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,505
Rym: It's Monday January 5th.

2
00:00:11,706 --> 00:00:12,288
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,428 --> 00:00:16,338
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight the humble netbook.

4
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,962
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:30,911 --> 00:00:33,938
Rym: I can't believe there's only one more year of the knots.

6
00:00:34,379 --> 00:00:34,640
Rym: I guess.

7
00:00:36,682 --> 00:00:38,609
Scott: What do they call like you know?

8
00:00:38,689 --> 00:00:41,400
Scott: thing is you don't have anything for them to call the nod.

9
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,570
Rym: Yeah, they called it on eight back in the day.

10
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,480
Scott: Yeah, what do you call the tens?

11
00:00:46,582 --> 00:00:49,560
Rym: We were not gonna worry about that teens that they're not all teens.

12
00:00:49,781 --> 00:00:50,991
Rym: We're not gonna worry about that.

13
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:52,120
Scott: that's even harder to name.

14
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,721
Scott: But then we get to the 20s will be all good for the rest of our lives like ah you know what I think it'll Happen.

15
00:00:56,741 --> 00:01:13,662
Rym: because when I listen to old people talk they say aught up to 19 aught 9 or aught 9 And then they say for all the tens they just say like 1911 1919 and then we hit 20. they say the 20s Mmm.

16
00:01:14,004 --> 00:01:15,431
Rym: I think that's what we have to do.

17
00:01:15,491 --> 00:01:17,059
Rym: There is no other reasonable option.

18
00:01:17,842 --> 00:01:21,512
Scott: Let's just change English so that they're all teens.

19
00:01:21,592 --> 00:01:22,996
Scott: It's 10 teen 11 teen 12 teen 13 teen.

20
00:01:27,062 --> 00:01:27,484
Scott: We'll be good.

21
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:28,248
Scott: we'll come the teens.

22
00:01:28,831 --> 00:01:30,580
Rym: I was an advocate of that curse when I was a little kid.

23
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:40,320
Rym: I remember I used to argue very much that English originally used base 12 because 11 and 12 were such weird numbers, and it made so much sense.

24
00:01:40,942 --> 00:01:49,862
Rym: Good job, and then when I was an omology when I was like seventh grade my teacher was like that's clever, but wrong Of course.

25
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:53,434
Rym: then he went on to agree with me that base 12 is much more useful, and we should have used that.

26
00:01:53,454 --> 00:02:00,999
Scott: I Guess if you like four three two and six you got so many factors in there.

27
00:02:02,301 --> 00:02:02,662
Scott: What do you need?

28
00:02:02,682 --> 00:02:07,376
Scott: the factors for most people can't factor for anything so I don't know.

29
00:02:07,577 --> 00:02:10,146
Rym: you know it's more useful For people like me.

30
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:12,760
Rym: maybe less useful for people who can't read or write.

31
00:02:12,901 --> 00:02:14,335
Scott: I don't know who know.

32
00:02:14,355 --> 00:02:25,839
Rym: I don't care But we'll probably do a show about the the New Year's extravaganza because we basically had the front row crew Up in beacon or down in beacon depending on you know which people for about a week.

33
00:02:27,103 --> 00:02:27,970
Scott: It was a good time.

34
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:31,166
Rym: It was kind of awesome though we actually had by all.

35
00:02:31,286 --> 00:02:45,282
Rym: we almost missed the new year because Scott and a bunch of people were upstairs playing Agricola and The game was running long, and I walked upstairs, and I'm looking at them And I'm counting up like who's gonna win, and I walk downstairs, and I look and it's like 1158

36
00:02:45,282 --> 00:02:45,422
Scott: yeah,

37
00:02:46,405 --> 00:02:53,411
Rym: and I'm like popping the champagne and trying to pour and all the I'm trying to make like 25 glasses of champagne And get everything ready.

38
00:02:53,713 --> 00:02:54,740
Rym: we all run downstairs.

39
00:02:55,302 --> 00:02:58,072
Rym: I couldn't even get the NIST clock up in time.

40
00:02:58,092 --> 00:02:59,517
Scott: you suck you going for the NIST clock.

41
00:02:59,537 --> 00:03:01,489
Scott: you got to go for time Gov it's much faster.

42
00:03:01,992 --> 00:03:04,483
Rym: Yeah, but I went for the NIST clock I use at work because you're stupid.

43
00:03:04,804 --> 00:03:05,005
Scott: time.

44
00:03:05,225 --> 00:03:10,979
Rym: gov has been trusty every year, but luckily we made it because of that extra leap.

45
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:13,847
Rym: second Not really we made it.

46
00:03:13,967 --> 00:03:16,959
Scott: we said no people like looking at the cell phones like oh, we missed it.

47
00:03:19,103 --> 00:03:21,056
Scott: It's not really that important.

48
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:28,649
Scott:  oh yes It is at some exact an arbitrary moment in time Which is no different than this exact moment in time.

49
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:32,040
Rym: I point out that I'm a person who celebrated the millennium on the proper year.

50
00:03:33,642 --> 00:03:35,070
Rym: All right, I did.

51
00:03:35,693 --> 00:03:40,396
Scott: Oh no an arbitrary You know calendar thing whoo you know what.

52
00:03:40,476 --> 00:03:44,734
Scott: if it wasn't for Gregor it would be a totally different date that you would do this.

53
00:03:45,116 --> 00:03:50,616
Rym: okay, but anyway We sang all Lang sign, and then it odd yesterday the last of the stragglers left our house.

54
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,787
Scott: Oh Wow, it was yesterday.

55
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:53,331
Rym: Yes.

56
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,640
Rym: It was yesterday.

57
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:01,060
Scott: Ah Well the house is like we cleaned it up surprisingly well.

58
00:04:01,281 --> 00:04:04,280
Rym: We clean the house up faster than we used to after some D&D games.

59
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:07,979
Scott: Yeah, it's still got some cleaning to do, but it's not too bad.

60
00:04:08,553 --> 00:04:20,899
Rym: Yeah I think part of it was that in the New Year's party because so much like people went out of their way to pick up after themselves as opposed to D&D where I would find like a Half full glass of something under the couch undisturbed.

61
00:04:21,482 --> 00:04:24,555
Scott: Yeah, also a lot of people were at other people's houses for sleeping.

62
00:04:24,595 --> 00:04:25,017
Scott: that helped.

63
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:27,406
Rym: Oh my god Did that help including me?

64
00:04:27,466 --> 00:04:31,058
Rym: I actually just kind of slept somewhere else and let people use my bed the whole week.

65
00:04:31,078 --> 00:04:33,725
Scott: Yeah Yeah, I wasn't about to do that.

66
00:04:33,745 --> 00:04:34,950
Scott: I need my bed.

67
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,400
Rym: Yeah, the nice thing was I could wake up to quietude.

68
00:04:37,943 --> 00:04:42,648
Rym: I could take a shower immediately Without having to worry about anyone else taking showers.

69
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:46,460
Scott: I just showered it weird at different times that way to be hot water.

70
00:04:47,522 --> 00:04:48,990
Rym: I kind of like a shower right away.

71
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,080
Scott: Yeah, I'd like to but it's not necessary.

72
00:04:51,261 --> 00:04:53,711
Rym: But anyway, we'll talk about all that some Thursday.

73
00:04:53,751 --> 00:05:06,496
Rym: I'm sure you're interested because if nothing else Saturday night Really felt like college suddenly like we'd all been around long enough to where we all Slipped back into the college lifestyle and that was one hell of a night as a result.

74
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:11,035
Rym: All right So so not enthusiastic.

75
00:05:11,076 --> 00:05:11,660
Rym: what's up with you?

76
00:05:13,001 --> 00:05:13,503
Scott: I'm tired.

77
00:05:13,644 --> 00:05:13,845
Rym: Mr.

78
00:05:13,885 --> 00:05:14,728
Rym: How could you be tired?

79
00:05:14,768 --> 00:05:16,816
Rym: We went to bed at like 8 yesterday.

80
00:05:16,836 --> 00:05:18,102
Scott: I want to bed at 10.

81
00:05:18,102 --> 00:05:18,565
Scott: Why?

82
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:20,360
Rym: because what were you doing?

83
00:05:22,841 --> 00:05:24,247
Rym: Were you just surfing the internet?

84
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:25,713
Rym: no, it's no better than playing.

85
00:05:25,753 --> 00:05:27,580
Scott: Wow, I wasn't doing that either.

86
00:05:27,721 --> 00:05:29,409
Rym: You're playing Fallout a single-player.

87
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:33,484
Scott: I stopped playing that at like 7 or 8.

88
00:05:33,484 --> 00:05:34,720
Rym: Good game anyway.

89
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:36,767
Rym: Tech news Monday, whatever.

90
00:05:36,807 --> 00:05:37,631
Rym: We're back new year.

91
00:05:37,711 --> 00:05:38,414
Rym: Oh my god.

92
00:05:38,455 --> 00:05:39,600
Rym: What do you got in the news?

93
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:44,241
Scott: All right, so, you know Amazon s3, right I May.

94
00:05:44,522 --> 00:05:46,028
Scott: basically it's Amazon's.

95
00:05:46,329 --> 00:05:47,776
Scott: is it simple storage solution?

96
00:05:47,796 --> 00:05:48,418
Scott: I think they call it.

97
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:48,780
Rym: I don't know.

98
00:05:48,961 --> 00:05:50,579
Rym: We're thinking about switching to it already.

99
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,420
Scott: I'm already using it for a bunch of stuff.

100
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:58,240
Rym: I'm gonna use it even more after we learn that Libsyn is just using that and then charging us more than they charge them.

101
00:05:58,802 --> 00:06:01,592
Scott: Well, it may or may not be charging us more than they charge them.

102
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:03,840
Scott: right but check this is how this works, right?

103
00:06:04,502 --> 00:06:10,440
Scott: Let's say, you know you get some hosting right from some company for I don't know a website, right?

104
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,651
Scott: Okay, so then they usually give you a bandwidth limit.

105
00:06:14,691 --> 00:06:14,832
Scott: Like.

106
00:06:14,852 --> 00:06:16,797
Scott: for example, our hosting is 200 gigabits a month.

107
00:06:18,362 --> 00:06:41,679
Scott: So if I put a 1 gigabyte video file 1 gigabit video file so it's 2 billion 1 billion bits of video and 200 people download that video then they cut me off and the website will be down until The next month right when it will come back up or I can pay them extra money on a per gigabit basis Which is expensive.

108
00:06:43,381 --> 00:06:58,380
Scott: so if you have things that are high in bandwidth that people are downloading or Maybe you just want to like have a safe place on the internet to put stuff You know, like you want to back up your computer But you don't want to back it up to just a hard drive in your house.

109
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:01,199
Scott: You want to back it up somewhere serious where you know, it's safe.

110
00:07:01,982 --> 00:07:19,336
Scott: You can just store stuff on Amazon's very very trusty servers and your stuff there is very safe and you can make it encrypted and secure if you want to and If you want you can give other people access to it so that you know I could put a video up there and then everyone in the world could download it.

111
00:07:19,456 --> 00:07:19,738
Scott: and it's.

112
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:27,499
Scott: you know it's not the fastest thing in the universe, but it'll work because it's Amazon servers and It's not free though, you know.

113
00:07:27,821 --> 00:07:34,014
Scott: They charge you based on how much you upload and how much is downloaded even if someone else is doing the downloading That's not you.

114
00:07:35,063 --> 00:07:43,920
Scott: So the result of that, you know Is that I get like a bill from Amazon every month for like a dollar and change because that's really how cheap it is.

115
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:58,900
Scott: now What they did is they just added a feature Which is a very interesting feature in that Let's say I put some files up there and I make them publicly accessible or at least accessible to the other people besides myself.

116
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,899
Scott: Now I can charge those people the cost of them getting the file.

117
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:14,780
Scott: So So if it cost two cents if it would have cost me two cents for them to download the video I can now charge them two cents.

118
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:27,296
Scott: In fact, I can also charge them more than two cents if I want to and you can actually now very easily set up Some stuff where you put data online and then charge people for downloading it.

119
00:08:27,556 --> 00:08:28,880
Rym: I wonder very very easily.

120
00:08:29,201 --> 00:08:34,260
Rym: I wonder if all those shady for-profit podcasts and things are gonna move to this.

121
00:08:34,885 --> 00:08:35,349
Scott: I don't know.

122
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:36,398
Scott: you might see some of that.

123
00:08:36,921 --> 00:08:41,578
Scott: You might see like some people putting like wares and then you have to pay them like a dollar to get it.

124
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:45,620
Rym: I don't know about that because you're pretty easily tracked to yourself.

125
00:08:46,283 --> 00:08:47,549
Scott: Yeah, but who's looking at these?

126
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:52,254
Scott: and you know, it could be just some encrypted file Mmm, you know that has a key along with it.

127
00:08:52,455 --> 00:08:55,478
Scott: No one knows Could put all kinds of crazy shit up there.

128
00:08:56,501 --> 00:08:57,002
Scott: It's gonna be.

129
00:08:57,022 --> 00:08:59,991
Scott: it's gonna be very interesting the result of this.

130
00:09:00,032 --> 00:09:04,279
Scott: but the question that it mostly raises is you know Who is supposed to pay?

131
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,852
Scott: Right because it's like right now the way the internet works.

132
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:09,560
Scott: as long as things are net neutral.

133
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:15,780
Scott: It's like everyone just pays for a connection that has some speed and then they use as much as they want.

134
00:09:16,243 --> 00:09:16,546
Rym: You know what?

135
00:09:16,566 --> 00:09:22,559
Rym: It's kind of like look at anime conventions versus comic conventions.

136
00:09:23,384 --> 00:09:24,760
Rym: Like it's exactly the same thing.

137
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:31,450
Rym: I mean if you go to an anime con you pay, you know You're 50 bucks or whatever to get in But then everything in the con is covered by that.

138
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:47,440
Rym: like you want to go to a concert go to the cosplay Go to the panels watch show whatever you want to do you pay for a badge and then that badge gets you into everything Everything in the world, but you go to comic cons and it's like alright I paid my 50 bucks to get in and I can walk around this little room in this little room.

139
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,588
Rym: But hey, I want to go see Kevin Smith up.

140
00:09:49,628 --> 00:09:50,813
Rym: That's another five bucks.

141
00:09:51,114 --> 00:09:52,760
Rym: Want to go get something signed by Stan Lee?

142
00:09:52,862 --> 00:09:54,943
Rym: That's another 50.

143
00:09:54,943 --> 00:10:04,619
Scott: Yeah, kind of like that I guess I. just the question is like if you're hosting some files on the internet, right and you want people to you know Look at those things.

144
00:10:05,302 --> 00:10:12,500
Scott: It's like who is supposed to pair you supposed to pay or it's like it caused Google money every time I go to google.com.

145
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,533
Scott: That's why they make that site as low bandwidth as possible.

146
00:10:15,593 --> 00:10:17,220
Scott: It's like this tiny piece of HTML.

147
00:10:17,461 --> 00:10:23,223
Scott: That's why it says privacy instead of privacy policy because it would cost them that much more Right.

148
00:10:23,805 --> 00:10:27,280
Scott: So right now Google pays when I visit google.com.

149
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:32,300
Scott: But should I pay because I'm the one who's benefiting by visiting google.com?

150
00:10:32,741 --> 00:10:44,154
Rym: I think no because if if we get into that world where it's pay for content and not just paying for bandwidth But also paying for the contents bandwidth not just your own bandwidth.

151
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:57,064
Rym: I One I feel like bandwidth is so cheap that anything that actually What makes you pay for the bandwidth you spend to get it will immediately be subverted by something free Mm-hmm.

152
00:10:57,707 --> 00:10:58,090
Rym: I mean one.

153
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,041
Rym: I would never pay for bandwidth for crap I would.

154
00:11:00,543 --> 00:11:05,340
Rym: I can't conceive of a situation where I would pay for the privilege of looking at something.

155
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,925
Rym: I would just pirate it at that point.

156
00:11:07,687 --> 00:11:23,239
Scott: I think what we should really happen right is when you look at it Everyone is sort of it's even all around, you know, sure I caused Google a lot of money But I have a website and people visit that and it sort of evens out in the end on all sides.

157
00:11:24,181 --> 00:11:32,800
Scott: See, so the only people who really should have to spend a lot of money I think are the people who have a a huge disparity of you know one side or the other.

158
00:11:33,322 --> 00:11:41,391
Rym: Well, the thing is if you look at most people, I mean what 90% of people just consume they don't have a website Mmm, maybe they have a myspace but they're not paying for that.

159
00:11:41,832 --> 00:11:42,976
Scott: No, they're not paying for that.

160
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:45,027
Scott: Oh Whatever.

161
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:45,430
Scott: It's.

162
00:11:45,511 --> 00:12:00,061
Scott: it's interesting though It is maybe people at least like because one thing is people don't realize it's very difficult even today to set up like quality e-commerce, especially if you have any sort of special needs or If you want it to be shiny and cool, you know It's.

163
00:12:00,081 --> 00:12:05,484
Scott: you're either going to pay a lot of money or you're going to do a lot of hard work Or you're going to have something crappy.

164
00:12:05,505 --> 00:12:08,975
Scott: You really can't get a high-quality thing for free.

165
00:12:09,015 --> 00:12:10,118
Scott: That's exactly what you want.

166
00:12:10,138 --> 00:12:10,860
Scott: That's also good.

167
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,200
Scott: It's just it does doesn't exist.

168
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:28,360
Scott: but you know things like this and Amazon checkout or Amazon payments Google checkout and stuff and It's gonna make it real easy for people to make like, you know, say a site where you know They you download videos and pay for them or something because YouTube doesn't offer that shit.

169
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,135
Rym: It definitely pays the way for micro payments.

170
00:12:31,296 --> 00:12:35,394
Rym: Like it's the first Viable does everyone will it be able to use Amazon?

171
00:12:35,414 --> 00:12:36,600
Rym: It'll just work automatically.

172
00:12:37,082 --> 00:12:42,380
Scott: Yep, basically sign it to Amazon download a bunch of stuff and then at the end of the month they charge you like three bucks.

173
00:12:42,861 --> 00:12:44,343
Rym: Yep, so, I don't know.

174
00:12:44,384 --> 00:12:49,152
Rym: Will this be the beginning of like webcomics and videos and things be having micro payments.

175
00:12:50,835 --> 00:12:58,397
Scott: I Was gonna be real interesting just to see like who uses this and for what.

176
00:12:58,879 --> 00:12:59,763
Scott: yes I'm very.

177
00:12:59,803 --> 00:13:01,472
Scott: I'm very curious to see what happens.

178
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:02,798
Rym: I've got a guess.

179
00:13:04,443 --> 00:13:05,412
Rym: I've got a hard.

180
00:13:05,715 --> 00:13:12,380
Rym: maybe The thing is it's difficult to say because pornography is pretty much free on the internet.

181
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:18,180
Rym: But then again, that's because it's all pirated and the porn people fight to ought to get their stuff off the pirate network.

182
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,047
Scott: That's a big problem with the porn right?

183
00:13:20,127 --> 00:13:25,420
Scott: Is that like, you know, you got a porn site and you charge money for the porn But you want people to come to it.

184
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,713
Scott: So you take some porn and you put it out there for free.

185
00:13:27,733 --> 00:13:31,992
Rym: that has your logo all over it But that's probably enough for that says enough for most people.

186
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:33,277
Scott: so they never come and pay.

187
00:13:33,297 --> 00:13:37,169
Rym: so Scott they come they just don't pay.

188
00:13:37,812 --> 00:13:42,560
Scott: if you don't put any porn out there for free No one will ever come to your site to pay for anything because they won't even know it exists.

189
00:13:43,062 --> 00:13:44,949
Rym: I can't believe I'm at a cum joke on the air.

190
00:13:45,009 --> 00:13:45,531
Scott: Hey great.

191
00:13:45,832 --> 00:13:47,960
Scott: Yeah, we're not on any air or on wires.

192
00:13:48,301 --> 00:13:48,964
Rym: No, we're on air.

193
00:13:48,984 --> 00:13:50,349
Rym: Okay, we can be on air.

194
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:51,574
Rym: There's wireless routers of me.

195
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:57,424
Rym: You have to pay for them anyway, so apparently Twitter is dead.

196
00:13:57,444 --> 00:13:59,309
Rym: It is no longer innocent.

197
00:13:59,350 --> 00:13:59,751
Scott: live Twitter.

198
00:14:00,092 --> 00:14:01,235
Rym: It's the end of the internet.

199
00:14:01,376 --> 00:14:02,680
Rym: It's the end of micro blogs.

200
00:14:03,163 --> 00:14:07,794
Rym: They've destroyed it because someone fished on Twitter.

201
00:14:09,301 --> 00:14:15,886
Rym: Yes, I'm gonna quote from the person who put this on slashdot Culture crash blogger blah blah.

202
00:14:15,906 --> 00:14:18,112
Rym: blah says this is the end of Twitter's innocence.

203
00:14:18,453 --> 00:14:22,540
Rym: will tweets become like email with two out of every three just worthless spam?

204
00:14:23,326 --> 00:14:26,882
Rym: wait a minute on One hand.

205
00:14:27,644 --> 00:14:38,100
Rym: no Twitter and things like Twitter can't become like that for one simple reason You only see the tweets that you subscribe to the people you were friends with.

206
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:43,440
Rym: It's a white list by default system as opposed to email, which is a blacklist by default system.

207
00:14:43,942 --> 00:14:50,429
Scott: Yep, so even if there are mad spammers on Twitter if you don't follow them You will never see their spam ever.

208
00:14:50,569 --> 00:14:55,976
Rym: only get spammed on Twitter if you follow idiots Follow spammers or are an idiot.

209
00:14:56,338 --> 00:15:06,800
Rym: Yep So in this guy mean basically all that happened here was someone Started compromised someone's account and started sending, you know private tweets to a whole bunch of people and a private, you know.

210
00:15:06,941 --> 00:15:08,020
Scott: Yeah, that's a good way to do it.

211
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:12,233
Rym: those tweets looked legitimate even though I don't think I could be fooled by.

212
00:15:12,433 --> 00:15:22,958
Rym: why would someone send me a tweet with a link to The login to Twitter and why would I follow that login which has clearly the wrong URL Type in my credentials and then not worry about it when it doesn't work?

213
00:15:23,466 --> 00:15:32,760
Rym: hmm but apparently a bunch of people did and those people's accounts got compromised and It spread all over the place and people are losing their shit over this and one.

214
00:15:33,443 --> 00:15:35,773
Rym: The internet was not terribly innocent to begin with.

215
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,320
Rym: it was just that in the old day.

216
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,409
Rym: It's kind of like in the early days of the internet.

217
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:41,760
Rym: There was the AOL like walled garden.

218
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,816
Rym: That was kind of like the Byzantine Empire with their walls around them hiding from the bar.

219
00:15:45,836 --> 00:15:46,780
Rym: Dark Ages around them.

220
00:15:47,182 --> 00:15:48,147
Rym: Except was the opposite.

221
00:15:48,207 --> 00:15:50,359
Rym: They'd walled the Dark Ages in and wouldn't let him out.

222
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:57,600
Rym: But then everyone in the real internet was like the Wild West in the early days.

223
00:15:57,922 --> 00:16:01,040
Rym: They all had guns and didn't trust each other for shit.

224
00:16:02,283 --> 00:16:14,048
Rym: It's still how it is Except now a lot of people are wandering out into the Wild West with their little carpet bags And they're going into the saloon and they give a put $100 in on the bar And they're like how much for a whiskey partner.

225
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:16,740
Scott: and then someone comes and blows their brains out and takes their money.

226
00:16:17,061 --> 00:16:20,500
Rym: Yeah, so the internet was never innocent and Twitter was never innocent.

227
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:25,740
Scott: But if you want to walk around in this wasteland, you better know Hokuto no Ken or know somebody does.

228
00:16:26,322 --> 00:16:28,709
Rym: But or else I don't see how this is news.

229
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,913
Rym: anyone could have done this.

230
00:16:30,013 --> 00:16:37,758
Rym: It's it's not you know, this is only news Because it happened over Twitter, which I notice and the internet cares about.

231
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:41,436
Scott: that's something I've noticed a lot in just in tech news lately.

232
00:16:41,456 --> 00:16:41,838
Scott: Is that?

233
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,404
Scott: What is actually news?

234
00:16:44,464 --> 00:16:45,528
Scott: doesn't make the news.

235
00:16:45,548 --> 00:17:02,640
Scott: the only things that make news are if you have an important word for example, like Something that is like the stupidest story in the universe But has the word Apple in it will be like at the top or has the word Google in it or the word Microsoft in it or if it has a big word in it then it gets to the top even if it's a worthless news.

236
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,380
Scott: Meanwhile, very very important news that does not have any of those big words and it will not rise to the top.

237
00:17:08,521 --> 00:17:10,674
Scott: And so basically this is a piece of crap.

238
00:17:10,714 --> 00:17:10,996
Scott: news.

239
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:13,165
Scott: fishing Fishing isn't news.

240
00:17:13,226 --> 00:17:19,940
Scott: fishing has been around everything is being fished banks are being fished Everything in the world is being fished and idiots still fall for it.

241
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,656
Scott: It's not news, but the word Twitter's in it's always at the top of the news.

242
00:17:24,098 --> 00:17:25,122
Rym: big deal Oh my god.

243
00:17:25,282 --> 00:17:26,909
Rym: Twitter Apple tweet Apple.

244
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:28,836
Rym: Twitter jobs to it tweet Twitter.

245
00:17:29,218 --> 00:17:44,042
Rym: Yep Of course this brings up another issue that I Guess Twitter is starting to become more mainstream Because I've never met a competent technologist who could ever be fooled by fishing Like it.

246
00:17:44,062 --> 00:17:48,897
Rym: just you can't be fooled unless the site you were going to is already compromised directly.

247
00:17:49,258 --> 00:17:53,112
Rym: You really Really have to go out of your way to get fished.

248
00:17:53,534 --> 00:17:56,224
Scott: Yeah, it's it's pretty hard It's sort of like.

249
00:17:56,786 --> 00:18:06,040
Scott: I mean I could sort of understand, you know people falling for fake medicine You know because a lot of them are really deceptive with their you know, fake medicine ads that are just outright.

250
00:18:06,121 --> 00:18:09,450
Rym: But if I go to Geico dot co.

251
00:18:09,511 --> 00:18:15,755
Rym: dot uz And it has a green Geico logo and like a red misspelled login.

252
00:18:15,775 --> 00:18:17,320
Rym: I don't think that's gonna get me.

253
00:18:17,621 --> 00:18:20,952
Scott: No, besides why would someone want to log into your car insurance?

254
00:18:21,093 --> 00:18:23,060
Rym: Well, my car insurance is also my credit card.

255
00:18:23,523 --> 00:18:25,535
Rym: Yeah, even though it's actually on a separate site.

256
00:18:25,575 --> 00:18:26,380
Rym: but yeah.

257
00:18:26,881 --> 00:18:30,511
Rym: But anyway, actually plus it's trivial to prevent fishing.

258
00:18:30,551 --> 00:18:37,288
Rym: if you're a big institution like all my banks and my credit cards and everything When I log in one it asks me for my username.

259
00:18:37,348 --> 00:18:41,620
Rym: All right, I type that in and then it prompts me for something.

260
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,071
Rym: It's not just something I know, you know.

261
00:18:44,091 --> 00:18:47,025
Rym: get the factors of security something I have something I know something I am.

262
00:18:47,045 --> 00:18:57,320
Rym: it also has something, you know You know, I log into my bank and first it shows me a picture of something I'm not gonna tell you what it is clearly and then it asks me a question.

263
00:18:57,661 --> 00:19:04,271
Rym: So not only does the bank make me prove who I am before it lets me in but it makes itself prove to me Who it is.

264
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:13,586
Scott: Yep So it's like, you know You're going a fishing is when you go to a website and you think that website is your bank's website But it's not your bank's website.

265
00:19:13,626 --> 00:19:14,630
Scott: It's some other website.

266
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:17,620
Scott: So how do you prove to your bank that you're you?

267
00:19:17,801 --> 00:19:19,070
Scott: That's how you get into your account.

268
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:20,460
Scott: is you give them your name and password?

269
00:19:21,123 --> 00:19:24,900
Scott: But your bank has to prove to you that it's your bank and isn't some fake website.

270
00:19:25,101 --> 00:19:29,498
Scott: So it shows you this picture and stuff and websites need to do this.

271
00:19:29,899 --> 00:19:36,880
Rym: Yeah I mean the only other option is like a secure ID open ID kind of thing all those RSA style keys.

272
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,446
Rym: That's pretty much unbreakable.

273
00:19:38,486 --> 00:19:40,855
Rym: But again, all those things can be brought around.

274
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,120
Scott: I got to order those YubiKey thing.

275
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:42,563
Scott: Yes, you do.

276
00:19:42,623 --> 00:19:43,488
Scott: So I got away with it.

277
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,119
Rym: And I kind of I kind of want to.

278
00:19:46,042 --> 00:19:47,460
Rym: I'm trying to convince my work.

279
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:52,640
Rym: Basically, they said if I get it working for like local stuff and I show to them they might be willing to dump the RSA.

280
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:57,094
Scott: You might have to code something for it, but you don't have to pay for the RSA server anymore.

281
00:19:57,114 --> 00:20:04,020
Rym: Yeah the cost of RSA Minus the cost of all the development time it would take to set up everything to use this instead.

282
00:20:04,781 --> 00:20:10,592
Rym: I mean, I even have this crazy idea of giving it to clients like they can get premium secure service.

283
00:20:11,534 --> 00:20:17,440
Rym: Oh Crazy idea, but I got a. I got to sell it to people.

284
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:25,410
Rym: So I got a. I got to get YubiKeys and make sure they actually no one will log into your pipeline and trade stock in your name Even though it's pretty much impossible to do that.

285
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:28,963
Scott: Anyway, so I know I know But you know people.

286
00:20:29,264 --> 00:20:34,925
Scott: if you charge like a small fee for people but will pay for it World of Warcraft did it and it Works brilliantly.

287
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,634
Scott: Yeah, those are RSA keys, aren't they?

288
00:20:37,097 --> 00:20:38,824
Rym: I think so I don't know pretty sure.

289
00:20:38,865 --> 00:20:41,274
Rym: while made a deal well blizzard made a deal with RSA.

290
00:20:41,294 --> 00:20:42,860
Scott: I don't know who's RSA or someone else?

291
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:50,759
Rym: Yeah, all I know is that the people who buy them are people whose accounts were actually Compromised usually due to no shady action on their part.

292
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,522
Scott: Right makes.

293
00:20:51,562 --> 00:21:02,160
Scott: the vast majority of compromised accounts on things like myspace or Facebook or Wow are people who have stupid Guessable passwords and their friends guess them or they tell someone their path.

294
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:11,399
Rym: Oh the other I think the other half equally valid are people who use the same login ID and password for everything that too and Then they make an account on something shady or poorly maintained.

295
00:21:12,001 --> 00:21:14,465
Rym: Mmm, you compromise that you've compromised everything.

296
00:21:14,826 --> 00:21:27,683
Rym: Yep, but I feel like if Blizzard has such an easily breakable system I mean, it depends on how they're being compromised and then Blizzard offers you the ability to pay Protection money.

297
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,509
Rym: No, that's kind of shady.

298
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:30,471
Scott: Yeah.

299
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,033
Scott: Yeah.

300
00:21:31,675 --> 00:21:33,923
Rym: But anyway, I got one more quick news I want to.

301
00:21:33,943 --> 00:21:34,971
Rym: I want to point this out.

302
00:21:35,234 --> 00:21:36,000
Rym: I'd like to do a whole.

303
00:21:36,362 --> 00:21:50,117
Rym: I realize this should be turned in kind of a whole show about electricity power grids not the game internet and all this sort of stuff, but There's this article on slashdot about distributed nuclear batteries as the new like electrical grid infrastructure.

304
00:21:50,157 --> 00:21:53,940
Rym: The idea is that you bury Nuclear batteries in quotes.

305
00:21:54,060 --> 00:22:00,760
Rym: I'll get to that in like every little neighborhood and then have all these like small entry points into the grid.

306
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:03,140
Scott: Wouldn't it be more efficient to just have nuclear power plants?

307
00:22:05,149 --> 00:22:14,791
Scott: Yes, I Mean centralized is always more efficient than distributed as long as you're not losing more over the power lines than you're gaining by Being more efficient at the generation.

308
00:22:15,112 --> 00:22:15,273
Rym: Yeah.

309
00:22:15,314 --> 00:22:18,208
Rym: Well, I didn't read the whole article yet But they test the man you have to do there.

310
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,520
Rym: The real issue here is that they say batteries.

311
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:23,651
Rym: But if you read the article, they're not actually nuclear batteries.

312
00:22:23,671 --> 00:22:25,055
Rym: Those are a real thing that exists.

313
00:22:25,517 --> 00:22:26,480
Rym: They're kind of awesome.

314
00:22:26,922 --> 00:22:28,848
Rym: I wish civilians could get their hands on them.

315
00:22:29,109 --> 00:22:31,137
Rym: I would kill for a nuclear power laptop.

316
00:22:31,177 --> 00:22:31,960
Scott: They're really heavy.

317
00:22:32,401 --> 00:22:37,918
Rym: They are really heavy, but you know what if my laptop weighed 10 pounds, but I only had to charge it once every 10 years?

318
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:47,920
Scott: Okay, I'd rather have it weigh five pounds in five years, you know what I'd be happy with a year.

319
00:22:50,501 --> 00:22:53,012
Rym: But these aren't actually nuclear batteries.

320
00:22:53,313 --> 00:22:59,673
Rym: they're basically small Self-contained nuclear reactors much like the kinds we're trying to use in Africa.

321
00:23:00,215 --> 00:23:01,960
Scott: Yeah, they're pretty cool for that purpose.

322
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:09,120
Rym: They are but I don't feel like this is a good idea yet because we haven't even got Yucca Mountain up and running.

323
00:23:09,501 --> 00:23:18,948
Rym: So we're still gonna have to do something with these things and there's a lot of issues with transporting nuclear quote-unquote waste across state Lines, I said there's something about nuclear waste.

324
00:23:18,968 --> 00:23:20,092
Scott: I still understand right.

325
00:23:20,413 --> 00:23:24,430
Scott: if it's if it's dangerous That means it's still radioactive right?

326
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:28,545
Scott: There's this nasty shit coming out of it Nasty shit coming out of it.

327
00:23:29,167 --> 00:23:33,000
Scott: then it can generate electricity somehow because there's energy being released.

328
00:23:33,302 --> 00:23:41,960
Scott: Let me make this even more confusing because all right If there is no energy being released of it from it in the form of radio radioactivity, then it's not dangerous.

329
00:23:42,242 --> 00:23:44,738
Rym: Let me make this even more confusing for you.

330
00:23:45,221 --> 00:23:53,466
Rym: Think about it this way the more radioactive something is the more alpha beta or gamma or whatever radiation Photon something are coming out of it.

331
00:23:53,646 --> 00:24:02,319
Rym: Yep, the more and so more energy and or mass is being emitted from it Mm-hmm, the faster it's giving that up the shorter its half-life is.

332
00:24:03,263 --> 00:24:07,358
Rym: The shorter its half-life is the less time it spends being dangerous.

333
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:16,760
Rym: Yep So nuclear radiation and nuclear waste is kind of a self-limiting thing and You can also usually get power out of it and you know what?

334
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:22,060
Rym: The answer is in France and in civilized countries where they continue to build nuclear power plants.

335
00:24:22,662 --> 00:24:29,599
Rym: They have power plants that are designed to use refined nuclear waste to generate further energy and make less dangerous ways.

336
00:24:30,601 --> 00:24:32,347
Scott: Yes modern technology.

337
00:24:32,547 --> 00:24:34,795
Scott: Well, we won't see that for 50 years even better.

338
00:24:35,477 --> 00:24:39,172
Scott: for anyone who's unaware I mean look how long it took us to get the cell phone from the Japanese.

339
00:24:39,292 --> 00:24:44,880
Rym: the majority of nuclear waste is Generated by a nuclear facility is what's termed low-grade nuclear waste.

340
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:56,252
Rym: you know things like gloves and suits and detectors and construction materials and those things are Barely radioactive and it doesn't even take them that long to be no longer dangerous.

341
00:24:56,974 --> 00:24:58,940
Scott: So then it's just goop and rocks.

342
00:25:00,222 --> 00:25:02,379
Rym: Well, no, it's mostly gloves and things.

343
00:25:03,781 --> 00:25:08,445
Rym: It's basically the stuff that you have to store for you know, 10 20 years and then dump it in a landfill or recycle it Or whatever.

344
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:09,054
Scott: Mm-hmm

345
00:25:10,563 --> 00:25:25,740
Rym: I think this is an interesting article because one thing I could see is that this would be a good kind of backup solution or a kind of intermediary solution for you know We do have the problem now that there are a small number of very big points of failure in the US power grid.

346
00:25:26,245 --> 00:25:27,620
Rym: I mean remember the Northeast blackout.

347
00:25:28,042 --> 00:25:35,353
Scott: I think it would just be cool to just we should just make a bunch of them just have them on hand and then you Know if there's an emergency or something just drive the trucks out.

348
00:25:35,776 --> 00:25:40,419
Scott: or even better Take them or put one in a truck and drive it somewhere then plug it in.

349
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,677
Rym: Yeah, or why don't we use these this technology more widely in places like Africa?

350
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,065
Scott: that well We are I guess trying.

351
00:25:48,086 --> 00:25:48,708
Scott: someone's trying.

352
00:25:48,728 --> 00:25:51,057
Rym: Yeah, we should do it more instead of using them here.

353
00:25:51,077 --> 00:25:53,305
Rym: Yeah, I Don't know.

354
00:25:53,325 --> 00:25:54,963
Rym: It's an interesting article I didn't I?

355
00:25:55,566 --> 00:25:58,540
Rym: I would have a lot more to say about it than I can fit into a little news bit.

356
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,107
Rym: So I wanted to point it out.

357
00:26:00,147 --> 00:26:04,200
Rym: I want you all to read about this stuff and some Monday We'll do a show about the power grid.

358
00:26:04,522 --> 00:26:06,814
Rym: I'm gonna try to find some expert to correct us when we're wrong.

359
00:26:07,216 --> 00:26:07,779
Scott: Good luck with that.

360
00:26:14,305 --> 00:26:26,580
Rym: but anyway things of the day and speaking of electronics or electricity or the power grid Have you ever when I was a kid like one thing my parents gave me was this giant set of electrical components.

361
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:33,540
Rym: It was like transformers and plugs like extension cords and light bulbs and adapters and fuses and it wasn't ever intended.

362
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,330
Rym: I could never make anything out of it because I wasn't allowed to plug it all in.

363
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:39,100
Rym: but I had all these things.

364
00:26:39,842 --> 00:26:49,239
Rym: And when I was really really young what I was obsessed with Was plugging something into an outlet and then plugging the other end of that somehow into another outlet.

365
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:51,572
Rym: really I didn't know what it would do.

366
00:26:51,592 --> 00:26:58,100
Rym: I was like five But I thought it would be a cool idea and this was like the goal of many of my young experiment.

367
00:26:58,161 --> 00:26:59,479
Scott: I never thought that was a good idea.

368
00:27:00,381 --> 00:27:00,883
Rym: So I would like.

369
00:27:00,943 --> 00:27:18,188
Rym: I was trying to make like little adapters and I was trying to do all this stuff and of course because I didn't have a soldering iron, you know, I was five there was no configuration I could put together that would allow this to come to pass Which was lucky because I would often plug my things in when no one was looking And then my parents would come and unplug it and tell me not to do that.

370
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:29,943
Rym: Mm-hmm, but it turns out I as a five-year-old was about as smart as a lot of 30 40 year olds because apparently a Certain department store.

371
00:27:29,963 --> 00:27:37,687
Rym: Well, not a department store hardware store got so many requests for a dual headed Power-card or power adapter.

372
00:27:37,767 --> 00:27:40,073
Scott: What would you possibly need one for that?

373
00:27:40,113 --> 00:27:46,464
Rym: They put up a sign saying hey assholes No There's a picture of this.

374
00:27:46,484 --> 00:27:47,267
Rym: you got to see this thing.

375
00:27:47,307 --> 00:28:04,800
Rym: apparently the primary reason people want these is that They have poorly thought-out their Christmas light plans and have ended up with two Backends of Christmas light strands facing each other and want a nice easy adapter to plug them in.

376
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,081
Scott: What?

377
00:28:06,422 --> 00:28:08,770
Scott: wait a minute now, that's not possible.

378
00:28:09,151 --> 00:28:10,857
Rym: Oh, it is possible, but I will say this.

379
00:28:10,957 --> 00:28:11,900
Scott: How is it possible?

380
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:12,742
Rym: What do you mean?

381
00:28:12,762 --> 00:28:13,284
Rym: How is that possible?

382
00:28:13,345 --> 00:28:14,270
Rym: How is that not possible?

383
00:28:15,013 --> 00:28:19,386
Scott: I mean Christmas light All Christmas light.

384
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:22,120
Rym: well most Christmas lives except for the triple long strands.

385
00:28:22,865 --> 00:28:28,440
Rym: We'll have that Shoddy looking thing that plugs into the wall that has the adapter in the front of it to plug something else into the outlet

386
00:28:28,701 --> 00:28:28,963
Scott: yeah,

387
00:28:29,365 --> 00:28:35,917
Rym: and at the other end of the strand will have the Female adapter into which to plug in a second strand of lights,

388
00:28:36,138 --> 00:28:36,440
Scott: correct?

389
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,845
Rym: so people would plug this male adapter in.

390
00:28:40,105 --> 00:28:45,127
Rym: now I point out that if they plug the male adapter in and They've already got the Christmas lights plugged in.

391
00:28:45,589 --> 00:28:47,296
Rym: They just made a deadly weapon right there.

392
00:28:47,316 --> 00:28:50,154
Rym: if they survive this They've already made it further than I would expect.

393
00:28:50,174 --> 00:28:55,794
Rym: Yeah But then they could plug that end into the next strand of Christmas lights and power them from the rear.

394
00:28:55,814 --> 00:28:55,874
Rym: Yep.

395
00:28:56,376 --> 00:29:09,699
Rym: I Just want to point out if you end up plugging, you know You haven't died yet and you plug the other end of this into another outlet somehow or if the other end of this Which is also a lethal weapon touches anything?

396
00:29:10,502 --> 00:29:11,746
Rym: Well, uh not gonna end.

397
00:29:11,766 --> 00:29:15,056
Rym: Well, I can't believe this sign was necessary.

398
00:29:15,717 --> 00:29:18,593
Rym: I feel like basic electronics much like.

399
00:29:18,633 --> 00:29:24,291
Scott: I don't know Electronics here, we're not even at electricity here.

400
00:29:24,311 --> 00:29:26,039
Scott: We're at plugging something in.

401
00:29:26,923 --> 00:29:28,208
Scott: You don't know how to plug things in.

402
00:29:28,288 --> 00:29:31,460
Scott: but the holes Jerry the holes, I don't know.

403
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,520
Rym: I feel more and more like public high schools.

404
00:29:33,944 --> 00:29:37,099
Rym: You should be able to opt out of these classes Like if you take a test.

405
00:29:37,601 --> 00:29:48,660
Rym: But if you can't pass a test, I feel like there should be a class in high school called how to not suck at Life after high school and it should teach you this should be elementary school how to plug things.

406
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,002
Scott: No,

407
00:29:49,142 --> 00:29:52,399
Rym: it's got to be high school because otherwise people will forget

408
00:29:53,012 --> 00:29:53,238
Scott: Yeah

409
00:29:54,341 --> 00:30:04,519
Rym: It's got to be like how to plug stuff in what a checkbook is and how to use it What a savings account is not to use it what a credit card is and why you shouldn't have one if you're in this class.

410
00:30:05,321 --> 00:30:08,656
Rym: No, I'm gonna turn on a gas stove without killing yourself.

411
00:30:08,957 --> 00:30:13,497
Scott: Yeah Man, I had to put that like class in a bunker somewhere.

412
00:30:13,658 --> 00:30:17,567
Scott: That's safe You know people go turn on the gas stove.

413
00:30:17,707 --> 00:30:20,115
Rym: Oh, I just imagine the practicum at the onion.

414
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:24,393
Rym: before you graduate your senior Water they lock you in a room.

415
00:30:24,434 --> 00:30:25,300
Rym: They shut the door.

416
00:30:25,721 --> 00:30:32,020
Rym: There is a Bunsen burner a lighter and a beaker and if you can boil the water without dying you get to go to college.

417
00:30:32,342 --> 00:30:37,370
Scott: All right, you get to go to community college Hall Road high.

418
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:38,157
Rym: So what do you have for me?

419
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:43,780
Scott: It's just a funny song by one of our favorite funny song bands the arrogant worms.

420
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,666
Scott: But someone made a little animated video to it.

421
00:30:45,727 --> 00:30:46,208
Scott: It's funny.

422
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:47,332
Rym: Which one is this?

423
00:30:47,352 --> 00:30:49,560
Scott: This is the the song of assumptions.

424
00:30:50,243 --> 00:30:53,496
Rym: Oh, I almost used that as my thing of the day before I saw this gem.

425
00:30:53,516 --> 00:30:54,520
Rym: That was my thing at the day.

426
00:30:55,201 --> 00:30:56,224
Scott: Yeah, the song.

427
00:30:56,966 --> 00:31:01,720
Scott: you get a lot of assumptions when you listen to the song, but your assumptions are not correct.

428
00:31:03,281 --> 00:31:05,086
Rym: Ra Ra Ri kick him in the knee.

429
00:31:05,106 --> 00:31:09,478
Scott: Ra Ra Ras kick him in the other knee in the ass.

430
00:31:09,778 --> 00:31:15,620
Rym: No, I Just remember that one RT hockey game.

431
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:21,809
Rym: We're doing the Ra Ra Ri dead thing and a guy was like Ra Ra Ri Kick him in the knee and the whole crowd's yelling.

432
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:24,660
Rym: and there was Ra Ra Ras and the really loud guy.

433
00:31:24,901 --> 00:31:29,200
Rym: You know just kick him in the and the loud guy yells as loud and long as possible.

434
00:31:36,123 --> 00:31:36,608
Scott: It's a good one.

435
00:31:37,032 --> 00:31:40,134
Rym: so uh We couldn't come up with what to do the show on.

436
00:31:40,395 --> 00:31:41,100
Scott: No, we suck.

437
00:31:41,601 --> 00:31:48,023
Rym: We had like ten ideas, but they're all like think about it a little bit have a have a plan and then do the show Episode ideas.

438
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:55,079
Scott: Yeah, so even though I guess a lot of people have discussed this already We've discussed it in the forums a whole bunch.

439
00:31:55,923 --> 00:31:58,274
Scott: It's a kind of a hot topic lately.

440
00:31:58,314 --> 00:32:01,353
Scott: Maybe we should talk about the netbooks Kind at least somewhat.

441
00:32:01,373 --> 00:32:09,400
Rym: it Amazes me to this day that it took as long as it did for a product like that to be made and sold in quantity.

442
00:32:09,781 --> 00:32:11,004
Scott: Yeah, I mean well think about this.

443
00:32:11,064 --> 00:32:21,543
Scott: right you had computers and computers kept getting faster and better and stronger with more see faster CPUs more RAM more hard drive space more everything Right.

444
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:24,614
Scott: and every aspect of computing got more powerful.

445
00:32:24,654 --> 00:32:26,400
Scott: and you know the prices kept going down.

446
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,170
Scott: So you can always get more power for the same amount of money.

447
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:37,194
Scott: and as that went on consumer level Applications because you know real applications always need more power.

448
00:32:37,234 --> 00:32:53,285
Scott: but consumer level applications Always needed more, you know, these games are too slow, you know these 3d games It's you know, even just saving this Word document takes a while, you know, it just everything, you know It need to get faster.

449
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:54,248
Scott: the Internet's too slow.

450
00:32:54,288 --> 00:32:56,978
Scott: Look it takes me like 10 minutes to sign into AOL.

451
00:32:56,998 --> 00:33:01,438
Scott: This sucks and things got better and better and better.

452
00:33:01,458 --> 00:33:14,748
Scott: and Then eventually sometime like, you know a couple years ago ish maybe two or three years ago, you know cable modems DSL We're everywhere, you know, we had Pentium fours AMD Use around that time.

453
00:33:14,848 --> 00:33:17,400
Rym: like Wi-Fi started to become completely ubiquitous.

454
00:33:17,661 --> 00:33:21,051
Rym: I mean right now they're like six access points within range of our house.

455
00:33:21,071 --> 00:33:23,680
Scott: Yeah, everyone's got laptops with Wi-Fi, right?

456
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:28,848
Scott: people didn't really need More horsepower than they had.

457
00:33:28,908 --> 00:33:29,390
Scott: I mean people.

458
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:29,812
Scott: what do they do?

459
00:33:29,852 --> 00:33:33,045
Scott: They go to YouTube they go to Facebook They go to myspace.

460
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:33,828
Scott: they brought.

461
00:33:34,089 --> 00:33:36,860
Scott: most of the stuff people do is in the web browser.

462
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:43,867
Scott: So if you were computer can run Firefox or Internet Explorer Can run flash right in the web browser.

463
00:33:43,887 --> 00:33:46,394
Rym: I use links and can play.

464
00:33:46,715 --> 00:33:48,179
Scott: it can play videos and music.

465
00:33:48,199 --> 00:33:53,420
Scott: and You know PC games, you know, everyone talks about the crisis, right?

466
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:59,367
Scott: But no one really plays that most people play, you know Even Wow has barely any system requirements.

467
00:33:59,407 --> 00:34:03,859
Scott: half-life 2 portal these sorts of games have barely any system requirements.

468
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:13,500
Scott: So Even if you're a gamer if you're not super crazy into the very high You know system requirement games, you don't even need that much horsepower.

469
00:34:13,701 --> 00:34:23,540
Scott: So most people the vast majority of people using computers no longer need Faster computers than what they've got and they won't for a while

470
00:34:24,021 --> 00:34:35,150
Rym: but not even just that look specifically at portable devices because the the scope of what people will do on the go is Far lower far smaller than what they will do at home.

471
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:37,780
Rym: I mean when you're in Starbucks, what are you gonna do?

472
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,620
Rym: You want to check your email go to Google Maps and find a restaurant?

473
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:45,998
Rym: Email, you know get on Twitter and tell people that you're about to go take a shit and all that stuff.

474
00:34:46,482 --> 00:34:50,500
Scott: You're not gonna sit down and play, you know NS in a Starbucks.

475
00:34:51,042 --> 00:34:51,643
Rym: I did that.

476
00:34:51,704 --> 00:34:58,090
Scott: some people play like that recently, you know, you might play like Wow for a minute or two But even then system requirements not too high.

477
00:34:58,191 --> 00:35:00,120
Rym: Well Wow doesn't run so well on the netbooks.

478
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:00,864
Scott: No, it doesn't.

479
00:35:01,125 --> 00:35:02,231
Rym: but but there's.

480
00:35:02,271 --> 00:35:02,854
Rym: they're kind of like.

481
00:35:02,874 --> 00:35:03,960
Scott: this depends on the netbook.

482
00:35:04,142 --> 00:35:05,780
Scott: Actually, you might get it to go for a little bit.

483
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:11,260
Scott: You won't be able to do like a. you know a huge thing, but maybe you can sign in and yeah, they're Wow mail.

484
00:35:12,601 --> 00:35:17,307
Rym: Anyway, yeah the time as time went on and as time is going on there's been more and more like the.

485
00:35:17,609 --> 00:35:32,440
Rym: the technology gap between high-end on-the-go use and average on-the-go use has broadened to the point that we have $400 little Netbooks that have three hour batteries and do everything the average person will ever want to do in Starbucks.

486
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,066
Scott: Yeah, because see here's what happened right.

487
00:35:34,167 --> 00:35:42,182
Scott: there were always well almost always tiny laptops But they were ultra portables like the ones we have or like the ones you know Cool people have.

488
00:35:42,202 --> 00:35:44,007
Scott: and what an ultra portable is.

489
00:35:44,027 --> 00:35:51,540
Scott: it's when you take an incredibly powerful laptop like a full power laptop We're talking core to duo full-on, right?

490
00:35:52,081 --> 00:36:01,240
Scott: But you shrink all the parts you should make everything really small and you put it in a tiny package and You put like two batteries in there.

491
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:06,096
Scott: So the battery lasts forever and the screen is small but the screen is very high resolution.

492
00:36:06,116 --> 00:36:07,260
Scott: It's a high quality screen.

493
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:12,159
Scott: So basically you get the best stuff in the world and you make it real in this but also the smallest stuff.

494
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:16,060
Scott: So you get a long battery life high horsepower?

495
00:36:16,761 --> 00:36:24,361
Scott: Low weight laptop and the result is something that costs like $2,000 and maybe even $3,000.

496
00:36:24,361 --> 00:36:30,420
Scott: The other way you can go is you can just get some piece-of-shit computer parts and don't even bother miniaturizing them.

497
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:33,775
Scott: They're so shitty that it doesn't take any effort to put them in a tiny package.

498
00:36:33,795 --> 00:36:34,880
Scott: and they're so shitty and slow.

499
00:36:35,222 --> 00:36:36,630
Scott: They don't use that much electricity.

500
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:38,159
Scott: So you don't need to put two batteries in there.

501
00:36:38,521 --> 00:36:44,765
Scott: just put one normal shitty battery in there to last forever because it's barely using the battery and You know who cares.

502
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:48,660
Scott: the screen is high resolution, it's like 800 by 600. that's good enough for freaking people.

503
00:36:48,741 --> 00:36:50,778
Scott: they don't you know, no high resolution from what.

504
00:36:50,798 --> 00:36:56,914
Scott: and You know people bought into it and it does what most people do.

505
00:36:56,934 --> 00:36:58,840
Scott: and it's surprising because I look at a netbook.

506
00:36:58,961 --> 00:37:03,122
Scott: It's like I couldn't live off of one but a lot of people can plus.

507
00:37:03,182 --> 00:37:10,959
Rym: honestly if I hadn't bought an ultra portable like if I if I didn't make as much money as I do and I wasn't And I wasn't doing the things on the computer that I do.

508
00:37:11,503 --> 00:37:13,273
Rym: But I needed more than a netbook like.

509
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:14,340
Rym: I needed a real computer.

510
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:33,720
Rym: I'd either have like the super powerful Desktop and the netbook what I carry on the train and around the city in my pocket basically in my tiny little bag Yeah, or I'd have you know, my PC at home I'd have the you know moderately priced powerful laptop that I bring like on trips or like when I'm going somewhere big.

511
00:37:34,424 --> 00:37:36,818
Rym: But then I'd have the netbook that I carry with me everywhere.

512
00:37:37,582 --> 00:37:42,726
Rym: Yeah, because the normal laptop plus netbook is far cheaper than Actual.

513
00:37:42,867 --> 00:37:45,744
Rym: good small, you know ultra portable I mean you can get.

514
00:37:45,824 --> 00:37:52,220
Scott: I bought my parents like a Dell 15-inch full-on laptop as good as it You know a full desktop computer basically.

515
00:37:52,280 --> 00:38:00,526
Scott: But in a laptop and it was like $800 and a netbook is like $200 and my laptop That's an ultra portable is $2,000.

516
00:38:00,526 --> 00:38:05,140
Scott: so I can get for two netbooks and two normal laptops or one ultra portable.

517
00:38:05,521 --> 00:38:18,740
Rym: Yep, now, of course the ultra portable really does serve all the purposes like it is the best possible laptop Unless you were one of those people who travels all the time and needs to do complex 3d rendering on the go.

518
00:38:19,341 --> 00:38:25,539
Rym: Then you need one of those big, you know, like 17 inch honking laptops, which I really don't see too many people doing.

519
00:38:25,579 --> 00:38:27,259
Scott: that I mean Really?

520
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:37,650
Rym: I do For the like the game 3 or 3d rendering when you were at home I can see the use for the gaming laptop.

521
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:40,520
Rym: to what if I went to a whole ton of land parties.

522
00:38:40,721 --> 00:38:42,380
Scott: You know, it's a whole ton of land parties.

523
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:47,780
Scott: But even then if I went to that many land parties like you buy a dedicated land box exactly.

524
00:38:47,941 --> 00:38:52,440
Scott: I would get like a high-powered box in a high-powered desktop.

525
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:56,139
Scott: But in this very small box like micro ATX or something, you got to carry the screen.

526
00:38:56,782 --> 00:39:06,740
Scott: Yeah, but I want that screen because see the main thing about a lot for gaming right is the fact that when you have a Laptop, even a gaming laptop the screen is attached to the computer.

527
00:39:06,861 --> 00:39:08,388
Scott: So you can't have the keyboard.

528
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,740
Scott: when you move the keyboard you're moving the monitor.

529
00:39:11,181 --> 00:39:17,080
Scott: You say I don't move the keyboard when I'm playing a game, but you're forced to have it in this particular orientation.

530
00:39:17,301 --> 00:39:19,514
Scott: Also a laptop keyboard is really bad.

531
00:39:19,554 --> 00:39:20,520
Rym: You know what I can say this.

532
00:39:20,681 --> 00:39:24,920
Rym: I did actually play NS in a Starbucks not that long ago because it runs just fine on my ultra portable.

533
00:39:25,341 --> 00:39:26,485
Rym: Yeah, and you know what?

534
00:39:27,348 --> 00:39:27,890
Rym: It was great.

535
00:39:28,492 --> 00:39:29,215
Scott: Did you have a big?

536
00:39:29,235 --> 00:39:30,419
Scott: did you plug the mouse into it?

537
00:39:30,499 --> 00:39:31,825
Rym: Yes I plugged a mouse into it.

538
00:39:31,845 --> 00:39:33,714
Rym: Yeah, you guys you got it.

539
00:39:33,734 --> 00:39:34,879
Rym: I've been using the GeekNights' mouse.

540
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:38,497
Scott: Yeah, you also, you know a set an external keyboard would help a lot too.

541
00:39:38,919 --> 00:39:43,191
Rym: Yeah Yeah I'm thinking about buying a little Bluetooth mouse just for my laptop for when I'm on the go.

542
00:39:43,251 --> 00:39:47,099
Rym: but at the same time when I'm on the go and I need A mouse I just bring the GeekNights' mouse.

543
00:39:47,380 --> 00:40:04,775
Scott: Yeah, even so the thing is that they do make like computers that are sort of you know The in-between desk like you can go buy from Dell like these things that like sort of fold up computers that are like their desktops Yeah, but then like the monitor comes out and separates a bit and they make things like that.

544
00:40:04,795 --> 00:40:05,799
Scott: I think Sony makes one, too.

545
00:40:07,021 --> 00:40:09,189
Rym: But I mean there there are some uses for those things.

546
00:40:09,209 --> 00:40:17,999
Rym: but in the end I see like most techie people I know They need an ultra portable and they either can't afford one or aren't or real or will not spend the money on one.

547
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:18,854
Rym: even they Can't afford it.

548
00:40:19,407 --> 00:40:24,495
Rym: But otherwise Like netbooks are awesome and I feel like more and more people are gonna buy them.

549
00:40:24,535 --> 00:40:30,580
Rym: and I don't think the argument I've been seeing in the media that netbooks are taking off because the economy is poor is true.

550
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:36,480
Scott: No, it's not because if you look, you know things like the XO PC and that stuff, right?

551
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:44,699
Scott: That was they were trying to make laptops, you know for like, you know the poor parts of the world where there are countries that do not have high quality economies to begin with.

552
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:49,777
Scott: and Then they sort of realized in doing that that regular old people want this too.

553
00:40:49,857 --> 00:40:51,645
Scott: and it was actually They.

554
00:40:51,686 --> 00:40:53,100
Scott: people have wanted this kind of thing.

555
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:55,409
Scott: It's one of those things or people want it, but they didn't know.

556
00:40:55,449 --> 00:40:58,180
Scott: they wanted it right because they were ultra portables.

557
00:40:58,562 --> 00:41:01,135
Scott: But no one except nerds bought ultra portables.

558
00:41:01,195 --> 00:41:02,080
Scott: No one even knew about them.

559
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:07,620
Scott: They'd see your laptop and go holy shit that small because they never seen anything so small because it was never marketed to them.

560
00:41:08,162 --> 00:41:14,687
Scott: and the idea of having an incredibly small laptop didn't even occur to people because they just sort of Laptops are about 15 inches.

561
00:41:14,707 --> 00:41:15,310
Scott: That's the size.

562
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:17,980
Scott: They are, you know, they didn't think about these things.

563
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,920
Scott: They didn't realize that they really wanted a small, you know laptop that was light and had long battery life.

564
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,809
Scott: They you know, so when they went to the store and they looked they were like, well, these are all big That one's got a big ol impressive screen.

565
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:32,160
Scott: I'll get that one not really thinking about it.

566
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:36,080
Rym: Well think if you don't know it's not obvious that ultra portables exist.

567
00:41:36,503 --> 00:41:39,060
Rym: Yeah, because I mean like how did I buy my Fujitsu?

568
00:41:39,181 --> 00:41:43,419
Rym: I had to go to the Fujitsu website and buy it from them.

569
00:41:44,441 --> 00:41:55,392
Scott: Yeah, I mean the only ultra portables you're gonna see are like it may be a Dell maybe The MacBook Air which is still a little big inches wise even though it's thin.

570
00:41:55,413 --> 00:41:56,756
Rym: It's also really heavy.

571
00:41:57,258 --> 00:41:58,020
Scott: Is it really that heavy?

572
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:58,946
Rym: Yeah, we got one at work.

573
00:41:59,289 --> 00:42:00,619
Scott: I thought it was supposed to be light.

574
00:42:01,723 --> 00:42:03,801
Rym: It's really heavy for how small it is Like.

575
00:42:04,403 --> 00:42:08,940
Scott: ah, I think my laptop weighs less and you'll see some Sony ones, which are not so great.

576
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:12,780
Scott: But you know, you're not gonna and the prices are gonna be way high.

577
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:22,660
Scott: you're not gonna consider them and they don't look impressive next to the other ones because You have to actually know what you're doing to realize that it's fucking awesome because it's a whole lot of power in a little package.

578
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:28,240
Scott: So the fact that now right you got the netbooks, right?

579
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:33,819
Scott: Not only the netbooks cheap which draws anyone's eye no matter what the economy is, right?

580
00:42:35,642 --> 00:42:37,950
Scott: But they put them in the stores where everyone can see them.

581
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:42,126
Scott: they market the hell out of them and they're actually like Cheaper than any desktop.

582
00:42:42,146 --> 00:42:44,737
Scott: You're gonna see that the cheapest computer you can get period.

583
00:42:45,279 --> 00:42:49,439
Scott: you know It's like if they can make a netbook for two hundred three and three hundred dollars.

584
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,347
Scott: Where's the $100 desktop, right?

585
00:42:52,709 --> 00:42:55,298
Rym: Yeah, the MacBook Air weighs a little over three pounds.

586
00:42:55,519 --> 00:43:01,600
Scott: Oh, wow Yeah, so I'm still wondering like the hundred dollar desktops are because I think that a lot of people would go for those as well.

587
00:43:01,681 --> 00:43:06,630
Rym: I think the reason there are no hundred dollar desktops it's the same reason why hard drives don't really get cheaper.

588
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:14,970
Rym: because if people always think hey if I can buy a 500 gigabyte drive for a hundred bucks How come I can't buy a hundred gigabyte drive for five bucks?

589
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:17,479
Rym: is it's still made of metal because it costs this?

590
00:43:17,539 --> 00:43:19,480
Rym: like Physically, it's pretty much the same.

591
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:26,017
Rym: So once they make a process to make bigger drives if I make a 500 gigabyte drive It doesn't cost any more to make than a 100 gigabyte.

592
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:38,200
Scott: Yeah, it's like even a. you know, the cheapest shittiest desktop computer still comes in a case Right with a motherboard and manufacturing time on a factory line and metal and soldering and all that business.

593
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:40,687
Scott: Oh that business that the price is not really.

594
00:43:41,409 --> 00:43:45,380
Scott: you can't push it down that much just because using you know cheapo parts.

595
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:45,821
Scott: That's also

596
00:43:45,842 --> 00:44:01,113
Rym: the reason why used computers never really come down in price so much because used computers are either unreliable Or take more time to make reasonably reliable then like the time it takes to put them back together by someone who knows Costs more than just buying a new cheap computer.

597
00:44:01,153 --> 00:44:02,580
Scott: That's why you see already faster.

598
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:16,866
Scott: Yeah That's why you see a lot of these places that you just bring your old computers to and then they take the working parts build new working computers of all the spare parts from broken old ones and then install Linux on them and given to poor people because There's really nothing else you could do with them.

599
00:44:17,548 --> 00:44:18,331
Rym: Do we have anything else?

600
00:44:18,833 --> 00:44:19,715
Rym: We have anything at all?

601
00:44:19,736 --> 00:44:21,320
Scott: I Don't know.

602
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:31,260
Scott: I think that it's just kind of weird how it took so long for netbooks to come around and it's strange that you know For the first time we don't have software pushing hardware as much.

603
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:37,160
Scott: I mean even in like the console gaming department right where it's always been this race and race and race.

604
00:44:37,481 --> 00:44:43,920
Scott: We're now gonna see we're probably gonna see a lot longer lifecycle on the current generation than any previous gaming generation.

605
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:54,820
Rym: and well because we're kind of hitting a lot of limits where things Like a lot of gameplay things got to the point where more technology does not really make for more game experience.

606
00:44:55,042 --> 00:44:56,674
Scott: It's like you have a 4d game.

607
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:58,805
Scott: not really It's like right.

608
00:44:59,167 --> 00:45:04,842
Scott: It's it's really hard to push things farther than we've got them at least software wise You know.

609
00:45:04,862 --> 00:45:06,005
Scott: and it's it's.

610
00:45:06,186 --> 00:45:11,500
Scott: and even so it doesn't make a significant difference when you do audio software like audition.

611
00:45:12,083 --> 00:45:14,574
Rym: Audition doesn't really do much more than cool.

612
00:45:14,614 --> 00:45:16,861
Rym: Edit did in the year 2000.

613
00:45:16,861 --> 00:45:19,173
Rym: Yeah, like 2000 2001 like it does more.

614
00:45:19,474 --> 00:45:28,380
Rym: this technology has advanced But it's advanced so little that you're never gonna have like audio applications for editing audio that are pushing the limit of computers.

615
00:45:29,401 --> 00:45:29,843
Rym: That's true.

616
00:45:29,863 --> 00:45:36,540
Rym: I mean it's got to the point where I can do like real-time Britney Spears a fine And all right, what am I gonna do beyond that with audio?

617
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:38,571
Scott: Yeah, it's kind.

618
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:41,399
Scott: It's like You reach a limit where it's like any.

619
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:43,646
Scott: Our imaginations are.

620
00:45:43,666 --> 00:45:46,299
Scott: what's limiting us, you know, we can't think of another thing to do.

621
00:45:46,862 --> 00:45:47,886
Scott: It's not that we can't do.

622
00:45:47,926 --> 00:45:58,660
Scott: it is we don't know what to do and the only things that we can think to do Right are like supercomputer things that supercomputers are doing, you know, like simulating all the weather on the entire earth.

623
00:45:59,302 --> 00:45:59,945
Scott: It's like all right.

624
00:45:59,985 --> 00:46:01,853
Scott: What next simulate the entire universe?

625
00:46:01,914 --> 00:46:02,155
Scott: All right.

626
00:46:02,195 --> 00:46:04,590
Scott: Well, we're sort of done then What are you gonna do beyond that?

627
00:46:04,731 --> 00:46:11,658
Rym: Uh, well, well I don't want to get into the simulation argument because if it's possible to simulate the entire universe, did you create the another universe?

628
00:46:11,938 --> 00:46:27,720
Rym: Yes Haha Luckily though the way out of that paradox for anyone who knows, you know Really like thinks about that paradox The way out is that it is possible that to simulate the entire universe Takes the amount of energy that it takes to run the entire universe.

629
00:46:28,241 --> 00:46:33,600
Scott: Also in simulating an entire universe you'd have to simulate a simulation of the entire universe which would fail.

630
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:37,046
Rym: Maybe anyway, I think we're done.

631
00:46:37,066 --> 00:46:42,985
Rym: I Was thinking of leaving the hospital.

632
00:46:43,065 --> 00:46:49,311
Rym: I I applied to a whole bunch of jobs and I was like I looked at different things and I even considered just like getting out of IT entirely.

633
00:46:49,331 --> 00:47:05,433
Rym: and I started looking at a lot of Tech journalism and I like I started sending my resume to newspapers and people like that and for a lot of places They would ask me to send a writing sample on the condition that I would relinquish my rights to the writing sample And then they could publish it if they wanted.

634
00:47:05,453 --> 00:47:16,090
Rym: Yeah Actually a little over a year ago wrote an article for and a certain I can't reveal who Outfit about how netbooks are the future.

635
00:47:16,351 --> 00:47:19,624
Rym: the first person to make one is gonna be so freaking rich like that.

636
00:47:19,644 --> 00:47:19,925
Rym: is it?

637
00:47:20,247 --> 00:47:27,680
Rym: netbooks are everything and they're coming and I'm gonna look after the show and see if I can find if someone actually ever published that.

638
00:47:28,581 --> 00:47:29,887
Scott: Yeah, that'd be pretty cool.

639
00:47:29,948 --> 00:47:31,776
Rym: They never even called me back after I sent it in.

640
00:47:31,796 --> 00:47:34,086
Scott: now They're probably just looking for some free stuff.

641
00:47:34,146 --> 00:47:34,869
Rym: Yeah, they were.

642
00:47:34,889 --> 00:47:37,600
Rym: they were kind of kind of shady and low-end anyway.

643
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:42,736
Rym: Yeah, like most tech journalism is if it's not on I guess the one or two sites.

644
00:47:42,756 --> 00:47:45,064
Rym: I actually go to yeah Yeah, all right.

645
00:47:45,104 --> 00:47:46,109
Rym: I think we're done.

646
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:46,912
Scott: Yeah, we got nothing.

647
00:47:46,933 --> 00:47:48,540
Scott: Let's go to bed go to bed.

648
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:54,020
Rym: But but shouldn't we be all arrested from our week and a half of vacation and New Year's and Xmas and all that?

649
00:47:59,284 --> 00:48:12,831
Rym: No This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
