1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:09,320
Scott:

2
00:00:09,281 --> 00:00:12,009
Rym: Hey, it's Tuesday, November 24th.

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:12,831
Scott: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:13,092 --> 00:00:15,659
Rym: I'm Scott over Skype, and this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:33,295
Rym: tonight We talked about ping and latency and I think bastards Let's do this That it feels like it's been forever since we did a Tuesday show.

6
00:00:33,396 --> 00:00:33,778
Rym: cuz like.

7
00:00:34,422 --> 00:00:35,632
Rym: Yeah, it has been forever.

8
00:00:35,692 --> 00:00:36,600
Scott: since we did a Tuesday.

9
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,960
Rym: I've been playing Left 4 Dead 2 a whole bunch.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,587
Rym: I don't think I've really talked about it.

11
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:43,500
Scott: on the show the last time we did a show it wasn't out yet.

12
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,272
Scott: I mean let me if I click to the archive and click on Tuesday.

13
00:00:46,332 --> 00:00:49,584
Scott: Let's see the last one was November 10th So it's been 15 days.

14
00:00:49,684 --> 00:00:52,532
Scott: wow it's a Tuesday show and a Tuesday show.

15
00:00:52,592 --> 00:01:02,612
Scott: before that was October 6th So it was like a month between Tuesday shows In between the Castle Crashers show and the D&D online show.

16
00:01:03,013 --> 00:01:05,160
Rym: lately has been practically impossible to do a show.

17
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:10,049
Rym: So we'll see how many we get out before the new year But we'll get out as many as we can.

18
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:12,980
Scott: these skype probably squirt out more poops than shoes.

19
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,811
Rym: Skyping days are definitely coming close to an end.

20
00:01:15,831 --> 00:01:17,419
Rym: There's no worry about that punk kids.

21
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,798
Scott: Yeah, you know we'll see how that goes.

22
00:01:21,767 --> 00:01:22,798
Rym: Hey, we'll see how that goes.

23
00:01:23,442 --> 00:01:27,459
Scott: You know it's Thanksgiving so I'm gonna be all full not gonna be ready to do any podcasting.

24
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,691
Rym: Well, I said I'm talking like next year the skype is gonna end.

25
00:01:31,952 --> 00:01:33,216
Rym: I'm talking like January.

26
00:01:33,456 --> 00:01:34,519
Scott: you like it escape to end.

27
00:01:37,561 --> 00:01:38,284
Scott: You're looking at you.

28
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:44,213
Rym: so I mean I for a while when I first we're gonna do the sky thing I was like you know what I could make Scott sound a lot better.

29
00:01:44,253 --> 00:01:45,680
Rym: I could do some post-badass napping.

30
00:01:46,164 --> 00:01:47,840
Rym: I haven't even changed the filters.

31
00:01:48,861 --> 00:01:49,584
Scott: Well, you know it.

32
00:01:49,986 --> 00:01:53,479
Scott: I got a slightly better microphone headset thing, but it's still.

33
00:01:55,021 --> 00:01:57,371
Scott: It's very difficult to get you know something like that.

34
00:01:57,472 --> 00:01:59,862
Scott: cuz even if I get like some awesome I've been.

35
00:01:59,882 --> 00:02:07,573
Scott: I had a bajillion dollars, and I got a giant awesome Amplify preamp and microphone and everything and then I swear can I do?

36
00:02:07,593 --> 00:02:07,853
Scott: I get?

37
00:02:08,074 --> 00:02:19,520
Scott: I get an optical input into my sound card And then my sound card as you know sends it over the PCI Express bus into the computer And then it compresses it and sends it over the network hole over Skype.

38
00:02:20,042 --> 00:02:24,300
Rym: Well if we were doing this super long-term, we'd probably just do the record on both sides thing.

39
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:24,843
Rym: But we're not.

40
00:02:24,883 --> 00:02:26,169
Rym: this is you guys are lucky.

41
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:27,154
Rym: We're doing any shows at all.

42
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:28,440
Rym: It's been kind of crazy up here.

43
00:02:29,681 --> 00:02:39,244
Scott: Yeah, between holidays moving more moving Jobbing left for dead Playing video games lots of left dead Live in.

44
00:02:39,907 --> 00:02:46,020
Rym: there's not that much time for podcasting, but god damn is left for dead like We'll do a full review of it later.

45
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:53,551
Rym: But I mean left for dead - it is different enough from left for dead one that I do not in any way I feel bad about having to have paid for it.

46
00:02:54,296 --> 00:02:54,436
Scott: Well.

47
00:02:54,477 --> 00:02:55,685
Scott: No I Wasn't.

48
00:02:55,745 --> 00:02:57,698
Scott: I never felt bad about paying for it.

49
00:02:58,941 --> 00:03:05,164
Rym: Before I played it I was kind of worried that it was too soon to have a new game as opposed to just Updates or extra.

50
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:07,934
Scott: that's the thing that I was upset about.

51
00:03:08,034 --> 00:03:09,780
Scott: right is I'm still upset about it.

52
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,342
Scott: Actually.

53
00:03:10,442 --> 00:03:12,931
Scott: is that why did they make it a separate game?

54
00:03:12,971 --> 00:03:15,540
Scott: what they could have done right is what did they add?

55
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,589
Scott: They added four new characters right.

56
00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:19,900
Scott: they added five new campaigns and melee.

57
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:25,429
Scott: they added like a Lot of different new special undeads.

58
00:03:25,449 --> 00:03:29,943
Scott: you got the the jockey the charger the spitter The.

59
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:30,424
Scott: is that it?

60
00:03:31,087 --> 00:03:34,119
Rym: the director is pretty much completely different in terms of how it like.

61
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,051
Rym: The whole game mechanic is different.

62
00:03:38,071 --> 00:03:42,065
Rym: the AI is bad, but like the actual zombie AI and all that stuff I think yeah, they also.

63
00:03:42,105 --> 00:03:44,675
Scott: they have the semi-special zombies like in each level.

64
00:03:44,696 --> 00:03:45,760
Scott: There's one kind of zombie.

65
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,833
Scott: That's not a special zombie, but it's not a normal zombie either.

66
00:03:48,873 --> 00:03:50,380
Scott: It's sort of like the in-between zombie.

67
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:57,545
Scott: Yeah, like the one with armor or the one in a hazmat Has mad suit Right or the clown right.

68
00:03:58,167 --> 00:04:02,240
Rym: um we had a man in a hazmat suit, but look what happens if we expose him to pay.

69
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:12,899
Scott: Anyway the The thing that bothered me wasn't that oh I don't want to pay for more left for dead because I knew it was gonna be just fine and worth the money.

70
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:13,561
Rym: well Me too.

71
00:04:13,642 --> 00:04:14,765
Scott: Oh, they was that.

72
00:04:14,866 --> 00:04:18,538
Scott: why didn't they add all that stuff to the original game?

73
00:04:18,577 --> 00:04:19,260
Scott: because I want us.

74
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:32,818
Scott: I still want to be able to play the original left for dead with the melee weapons and the Special zombies, and I want to use the old characters on the new maps and the new characters and the old maps and the melee Weapons on both and the special zombies on both, but they didn't do that.

75
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:40,140
Scott: so now It's like if you play the old left for dead maps with the old characters You don't get no melee weapons you only get melee weapons on the new map.

76
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,767
Rym: See that's why because you know play.

77
00:04:41,827 --> 00:05:00,420
Rym: I played left for dead one again after I'd played to a whole bunch to try to compare To figure out like what exactly is different when I'm playing and I realized that one Left for dead one really like the optimal strategy was basically for humans Clipping on top of each other walking as a unit with guns pointed in four directions

78
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:06,256
Scott: Yes, and what I'm saying is they could have sort of at the same time as putting out left for dead two.

79
00:05:06,316 --> 00:05:15,486
Scott: they could have reinvigorated Left for dead one because if it had the special zombies and the melee weapons and all that business in the old game it that Game suddenly would have this.

80
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:17,774
Scott: it would have been improved, but why bother?

81
00:05:17,814 --> 00:05:19,059
Rym: I mean really why bother?

82
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:19,440
Rym: why not?

83
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,168
Scott: It doesn't take that much work to do that.

84
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:23,177
Rym: It probably would have compared to how much money.

85
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:24,680
Rym: It's gonna make you I mean, it's still a business.

86
00:05:24,781 --> 00:05:27,020
Rym: It's not like they can do this completely out of the goodness of their art.

87
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,919
Scott: They would have made the same amount of money either way.

88
00:05:30,302 --> 00:05:32,079
Rym: No, it costs less to do what they did.

89
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:33,035
Rym: now There's no reason to do that.

90
00:05:33,137 --> 00:05:41,824
Rym: plus I'm sure there will be either updates or expansions that maybe they'll even sell DLC like all of left 4 dead 1 with the left 4 dead 2 stuff.

91
00:05:41,844 --> 00:05:43,510
Scott: I've noticed that valve.

92
00:05:43,711 --> 00:05:46,000
Scott: you know they really like to just not charge.

93
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:52,180
Scott: You know they just all the updates on the PC are totally free, and they only you know give the shaft to the Xbox.

94
00:05:52,422 --> 00:05:54,884
Scott: Yeah, yes three people plus I guess.

95
00:05:55,005 --> 00:06:02,040
Rym: semantically I can kind of see like the difference between two and one Because the gameplay in effect is almost completely different.

96
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:05,592
Rym: I mean look at left 4 dead 1. you're like however characters like hunkered together.

97
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:10,420
Rym: the strategies are pretty solid like yes Because there aren't any special zombies.

98
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,123
Rym: No, it's not.

99
00:06:11,384 --> 00:06:15,700
Rym: it's not just that it's that the the way hordes come in and the way zombies attack.

100
00:06:16,222 --> 00:06:20,260
Rym: You can get away with splitting up the group a lot more even on the harder.

101
00:06:20,441 --> 00:06:23,651
Scott: They could have added the better zombie AI to the old game too.

102
00:06:23,671 --> 00:06:26,400
Rym: Yeah, but I'm saying because semantically not games not.

103
00:06:27,701 --> 00:06:39,619
Rym: I'm saying that semantically like it's a different enough game and different of experience that it could warrant calling it a 2 instead of a 1. now whether or not they should have put that stuff back into left 4 dead 1 there's absolutely no economic reason to do so.

104
00:06:41,124 --> 00:06:41,750
Scott: It doesn't matter.

105
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:42,436
Scott: They should have done it.

106
00:06:42,497 --> 00:06:42,719
Rym: Why?

107
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:47,218
Scott: Just because it would be so much more playing action going on now.

108
00:06:47,861 --> 00:06:50,875
Rym: I think people because the thing is no one cares ever just playing left 4 dead 2 because it's great.

109
00:06:51,216 --> 00:06:53,967
Rym: hardly anyone's playing left 4 Dead 1 anymore except the people who can't afford to.

110
00:06:54,448 --> 00:06:57,679
Scott: yeah, but people would play left 4 dead 2 even more if they could.

111
00:06:58,161 --> 00:07:03,920
Rym: You know if they took left 4 if they added all of the left 4 dead 1 stuff into 2 I could see that.

112
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,619
Rym: But there's no reason to have like if you had left 4 dead 1 they add stuff to it.

113
00:07:08,282 --> 00:07:10,452
Scott: No, what I mean is not like that.

114
00:07:10,512 --> 00:07:14,700
Scott: what it should have just been is you know Call it left 4 dead to call it whatever you want.

115
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,845
Scott: But there's only.

116
00:07:15,865 --> 00:07:24,440
Scott: you only have one game in your steam list and you double-click on it And it has all the campaigns all the zombies all the characters all the maps all the everything in one game.

117
00:07:24,741 --> 00:07:25,464
Scott: That's what I want.

118
00:07:25,925 --> 00:07:27,712
Rym: Yeah, but it probably would have cost more to do that.

119
00:07:27,773 --> 00:07:28,295
Rym: So I bother.

120
00:07:29,078 --> 00:07:29,620
Rym: I mean the man.

121
00:07:30,121 --> 00:07:35,800
Scott: How much more difficult is it to make a separate game on the exact same engine than to just take those Scott Scott?

122
00:07:36,643 --> 00:07:38,032
Rym: You never think about this.

123
00:07:38,052 --> 00:07:39,200
Rym: from the practical perspective.

124
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,180
Rym: It would cost more than zero dollars and they would not make more than zero dollars more money.

125
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:52,230
Rym: I don't think it makes a who would have bought and as to because of that that wouldn't have all that I mean who would have bought it that didn't already buy it.

126
00:07:52,491 --> 00:07:54,680
Scott: because of that there were some people boycotting.

127
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,587
Scott: So I don't.

128
00:07:56,091 --> 00:07:57,240
Rym: I don't think those people would have bought it.

129
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,333
Rym: Anyway, they were only boycotting because left 4 dead 2 came out too soon and they were.

130
00:08:01,353 --> 00:08:03,460
Scott: they were boycotting for exactly what I'm telling you.

131
00:08:04,581 --> 00:08:07,330
Scott: I wanted an expansion and not a sequel.

132
00:08:07,912 --> 00:08:08,313
Rym: That's just cuz.

133
00:08:08,353 --> 00:08:10,179
Rym: I didn't want to pay for a full game pretty much.

134
00:08:11,001 --> 00:08:11,543
Scott: No, they were.

135
00:08:11,603 --> 00:08:15,036
Scott: I would have paid the same price if it was an expansion, but you bought it.

136
00:08:15,117 --> 00:08:17,627
Rym: you bought left 4 dead 2 So you're not about it.

137
00:08:17,687 --> 00:08:19,656
Scott: I would have bought it no matter what it's still great.

138
00:08:19,757 --> 00:08:24,510
Rym: Yeah, but Scott You're gonna buy it no matter what is the price or timing.

139
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:25,654
Rym: you're gonna buy it no matter what.

140
00:08:25,754 --> 00:08:29,127
Rym: I highly highly doubt that there Was any abs at all?

141
00:08:29,227 --> 00:08:32,399
Rym: No economic incentive whatsoever for them to have done what you wanted them to do.

142
00:08:34,725 --> 00:08:35,190
Scott: Whatever.

143
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:38,679
Rym: I Disagree, I just think it's a business move.

144
00:08:39,044 --> 00:08:46,978
Scott: The point is that you said originally Right that the reason that people were upset is because of timing or pricing and that is not why people are upset.

145
00:08:47,018 --> 00:08:50,980
Scott: people are upset Because it was a you know separate thing and not an addition.

146
00:08:52,806 --> 00:08:55,656
Scott: Jay would have been practically no effort to make it an addition.

147
00:08:55,696 --> 00:08:57,003
Scott: It's the exact same engine I think.

148
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:58,354
Rym: one you underestimate the effort.

149
00:08:58,677 --> 00:09:00,488
Rym: and two I mean look at the old maps like the.

150
00:09:00,508 --> 00:09:02,540
Rym: the new AI wouldn't have worked well with the old map.

151
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,970
Rym: They would have to restructure everything.

152
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:11,060
Rym: I Don't I highly doubt it would have been a problem Alright, but they didn't do it and there was no reason to so they didn't.

153
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:18,180
Rym: Plus, I mean most of the people I see complaining online were complaining about the fact that why are they making a whole new game?

154
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:18,803
Rym: So soon?

155
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:20,600
Rym: because they didn't want to pay for a whole new game.

156
00:09:20,882 --> 00:09:22,900
Rym: They didn't really dwell on any minutia.

157
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:26,439
Scott: But on that feeling they're gonna come out with left 4 dead 3 about a year from now.

158
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,329
Rym: Yeah, they proved that this is an economically viable.

159
00:09:29,429 --> 00:09:31,175
Scott: Hopefully they will make left 4 dead 3 add-on.

160
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,531
Rym: Definitely not.

161
00:09:34,653 --> 00:09:44,000
Rym: I would in fact I would bet you a large sum of money that if they're probably gonna follow the trend of Every X whatever just make a new left 4 dead game and I'll keep making them till they don't sell the new ones anymore.

162
00:09:44,101 --> 00:09:51,920
Rym: so how would you like it right if you're playing counter-strike beta 7 and Then counter-strike beta 8 came out and then beta 7 disappeared because it was the new game?

163
00:09:52,482 --> 00:09:58,560
Scott: Right and not only that but all of the maps in counter-strike beta 7 were gone forever and they're all new maps every single version.

164
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,838
Scott: and you can never play the old maps again because they were dead.

165
00:10:00,858 --> 00:10:04,733
Rym: and They're all new weapons, but you can you just go play them.

166
00:10:05,196 --> 00:10:05,899
Rym: you can just play them.

167
00:10:07,664 --> 00:10:09,839
Rym: You just play them in left 4 dead 1 if you want to.

168
00:10:10,636 --> 00:10:12,508
Scott: Yeah But that no one playing it anymore.

169
00:10:12,549 --> 00:10:18,050
Scott: the server is all shut down because they're separate dedicated Servers and people stop playing it and the game just disappears.

170
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:21,080
Scott: So it's the same way that you can't play tribes 2 anymore.

171
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:24,480
Rym: So would you just not played counter-strike if that were the case?

172
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,679
Rym: Would you have probably?

173
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:33,340
Rym: Yes, so because all I was sick of dust I would have been great if every version of the beta they had all new maps.

174
00:10:33,701 --> 00:10:38,620
Rym: Yeah, but you're still pining for Thunder only because it was actually that map was kind of broken.

175
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:42,356
Rym: I only pine for it because it existed for such a short span of time.

176
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:43,280
Rym: I never really got to play it.

177
00:10:44,341 --> 00:10:48,481
Rym: Same with left for 10, but it's still there in left 4 dead 1.

178
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,151
Scott: Yeah, but that one's going away eventually you're not.

179
00:10:51,171 --> 00:11:03,469
Scott: you can't get a versus game of left 4 dead 1 eventually You know, so if you feel like you want to go back to that multiplayer like the verses of left 4 dead is really Not like people get sick of the campaigns.

180
00:11:03,489 --> 00:11:09,712
Rym: There's much more incentive to want entirely new campaigns all the time Plus I'm sure later on.

181
00:11:09,733 --> 00:11:10,980
Rym: I mean think about the brilliance of valve.

182
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,202
Rym: You know.

183
00:11:11,282 --> 00:11:13,280
Scott: now we have ten campaigns and you know.

184
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,271
Scott: So if you get bored of the five that are in the current version Sure, it's gonna be good.

185
00:11:17,292 --> 00:11:21,380
Scott: when the next version comes out You're gonna get five more but maybe you'll get some more excitement.

186
00:11:21,562 --> 00:11:34,350
Rym: You know a year from now if you could go back to the original You have to always think about everything a gaming industry does from the economic business perspective and what's gonna make more money if they keep Making new versions, you know, it's gonna make more money.

187
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:43,900
Scott: I'll tell you what's gonna make more money right think about it this Here's how it makes more money comes along right now, right and they they haven't bought either game, right?

188
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:49,880
Scott: They're gonna buy just left 4 dead 2. but yeah, if it was an expansion they would buy both games.

189
00:11:50,462 --> 00:11:56,404
Scott: So they're actually selling less left 4 dead ones because left 4 dead 2 is not an expansion They've probably.

190
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,880
Rym: they're probably assuming they can just drop left 4 dead 1 at this point.

191
00:12:00,681 --> 00:12:02,528
Scott: What's the economic incentive for that?

192
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:03,652
Rym: because it done.

193
00:12:03,853 --> 00:12:09,080
Rym: why if you're not selling more copies of it There's no reason to keep the servers online unless you'll take off enough fans.

194
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,089
Scott: Servers are run by normal people not by them.

195
00:12:12,169 --> 00:12:13,635
Scott: Remember it's dedicated servers.

196
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,820
Scott: It's not valve servers.

197
00:12:15,181 --> 00:12:17,189
Rym: Actually initially valve host is a lot of the servers.

198
00:12:17,731 --> 00:12:20,040
Scott: I've never seen a valve hosted server in my life.

199
00:12:20,401 --> 00:12:27,037
Scott: Uh-huh, not since the one have I seen a company hosted server regardless.

200
00:12:27,058 --> 00:12:28,040
Rym: They're not gonna do what you want.

201
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,419
Rym: They never will and they're probably gonna release.

202
00:12:29,903 --> 00:12:32,339
Rym: In fact, they're probably at some point gonna start releasing DLC.

203
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:37,160
Rym: That is hey all the campaigns from left 4 dead 1 for 15 bucks and left 4 dead.

204
00:12:37,662 --> 00:12:38,687
Scott: They wouldn't charge money for it.

205
00:12:38,707 --> 00:12:39,551
Scott: They just do it for free.

206
00:12:39,571 --> 00:12:40,636
Rym: Yeah, they charge money for it.

207
00:12:42,002 --> 00:12:46,319
Scott: No, they've never charged money for any additional maps or anything on the PC.

208
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:51,477
Scott: They've given almost a hundred updates to Team Fortress 2 all of which have been free.

209
00:12:51,658 --> 00:12:56,956
Scott: Yep for now Yeah, so they're never gonna charge for DLC on the PC on Steam.

210
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:58,180
Rym: I'll bet they will at some point.

211
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,948
Scott: I mean not for a valve product.

212
00:13:00,169 --> 00:13:01,334
Rym: I'll bet at some point they will.

213
00:13:01,394 --> 00:13:02,580
Rym: money is a powerful lure.

214
00:13:03,446 --> 00:13:04,675
Scott: I do not see it happening.

215
00:13:04,836 --> 00:13:06,880
Scott: All right anyway.

216
00:13:08,001 --> 00:13:10,669
Scott: So let's talk about some other gaming news.

217
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:19,479
Scott: NS2 is actually gonna come out I guarantee it at this point because a map maker for NS2 came out.

218
00:13:20,001 --> 00:13:21,145
Scott: They actually released it.

219
00:13:21,246 --> 00:13:27,989
Scott: if you have pre-ordered NS2 either the deluxe version or the regular version You can go and download the NS map making.

220
00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:31,660
Scott: the NS2 map making program that they you know.

221
00:13:31,741 --> 00:13:32,899
Scott: I guess it's the beta of it.

222
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:33,587
Scott: I don't know if it's the.

223
00:13:33,668 --> 00:13:44,621
Scott: it's not the final version But it's it's good enough to make maps and there's plenty of screenshots of maps people have made and video tutorials and all this stuff and you know what This It's.

224
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:51,219
Scott: it's a bit might be early to call this and also I personally don't have that much experience with game map making.

225
00:13:51,379 --> 00:13:53,079
Scott: at least You know FPS game map making.

226
00:13:54,342 --> 00:14:01,392
Scott: But I'm pretty confident to say that this is the greatest game map maker that has ever existed For two reasons.

227
00:14:01,453 --> 00:14:16,987
Scott: number one It's usable like if you've ever tried to use like the original like the world craft Which is the half-life map making thing or if you've tried to use the unreal level editor, they are not easy They are a huge pain in the ass.

228
00:14:17,167 --> 00:14:18,070
Scott: They are not fun.

229
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:19,395
Scott: They are not intuitive.

230
00:14:19,556 --> 00:14:20,640
Scott: They're just a mess.

231
00:14:21,382 --> 00:14:42,040
Scott: This is actually something that a normal human being can figure out how to use and make maps with and it's actually you know I my experience is with AutoCAD and I was able to just like sit at this and be like Oh I know exactly what half these buttons do and I only needed tutorial for the other half and I was just yep looked at it Drawing walls drawing good ground put textures on things.

232
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:55,838
Rym: well part of it is this is the whole situation where whenever you're trying to make something the best way to make a great product is to have some other idea in mind and just make the tools that are useful to make your real idea and the tools themselves will Usually be better than whatever your idea was.

233
00:14:56,542 --> 00:14:57,586
Scott: Is that happens often?

234
00:14:57,888 --> 00:14:59,293
Rym: and and part of it with this?

235
00:14:59,353 --> 00:15:00,237
Rym: I mean, they're a small team.

236
00:15:00,257 --> 00:15:00,980
Rym: They have to be efficient.

237
00:15:01,421 --> 00:15:09,285
Rym: They basically made the editor do all the intelligent defaults for the for anything you wanted to do to make like a map For a FPS.

238
00:15:09,747 --> 00:15:12,358
Rym: it does everything just exactly the default.

239
00:15:12,398 --> 00:15:12,820
Rym: if you want it.

240
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,920
Rym: I mean, alright, I put a texture or something on the top.

241
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,974
Rym: It assumes it to ceiling makes it point and connect all the walls automatically.

242
00:15:20,576 --> 00:15:20,757
Scott: Yep.

243
00:15:20,777 --> 00:15:27,720
Scott: The other thing is that Apparently when you can't test this because you don't have the actual NS2 game yet You only have the map maker.

244
00:15:28,222 --> 00:15:38,520
Scott: But apparently if you have the game and the map maker you can have them open at the same time and you can edit the map Right in the map editor and then it will be edited in the game in real time.

245
00:15:39,641 --> 00:15:50,456
Scott: So, you know so it's not one of those situations like now where it's like you make a map you compile your render You go to the game you play you exit the game you render.

246
00:15:50,536 --> 00:15:50,656
Scott: you.

247
00:15:50,696 --> 00:15:51,560
Scott: could you know edit, right?

248
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,271
Scott: It's you edit the the map while you're in the game to get.

249
00:15:55,291 --> 00:16:03,971
Scott: you can get it just right like immediately and oh my god I can't wait to see that in action because That'll be so sweet, you know you move to the left window.

250
00:16:03,991 --> 00:16:05,295
Scott: you got two monitors.

251
00:16:05,436 --> 00:16:06,680
Scott: one monitor you go in the game.

252
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,563
Scott: We're walking around.

253
00:16:08,105 --> 00:16:09,611
Scott: you see that the hallways too short.

254
00:16:09,691 --> 00:16:11,980
Scott: So you extend it a little bit, you know, you go.

255
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,164
Scott: Okay, the hallways long enough.

256
00:16:13,225 --> 00:16:15,654
Scott: now the skulk doesn't you know, you're?

257
00:16:15,694 --> 00:16:17,240
Scott: you get a skulk in there you see up.

258
00:16:17,381 --> 00:16:20,599
Scott: I can see the skulk hiding but he's not completely concealed in the dark.

259
00:16:20,941 --> 00:16:27,070
Scott: So you make the ceiling a little higher and now the skulk is concealed and you're like, okay That's a good, you know size cranny above the door.

260
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:29,760
Scott: You know that that's gonna make some pretty good maps right there.

261
00:16:30,061 --> 00:16:34,119
Rym: I think I'm gonna focus right away on some sort of marine race.

262
00:16:34,862 --> 00:16:36,809
Scott: You're working on your gorge race map, right?

263
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:37,632
Scott: You have a gorge.

264
00:16:37,652 --> 00:16:39,860
Scott: he jumps and he makes it onto the platform.

265
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:44,094
Rym: Well, then clearly if he can make it it's way a little further away.

266
00:16:44,114 --> 00:16:45,839
Scott: He did have the gorge jump again.

267
00:16:45,859 --> 00:16:53,340
Rym: He Best part about gorge race is the fact that it takes like an hour for anyone to get past the first couple of rooms.

268
00:16:54,223 --> 00:17:02,391
Scott: Well people have gotten kind of good at it now So they usually don't start fucking up to like room thing is even if you're good at it There's a thousand fuckheads preventing you from completing it.

269
00:17:02,492 --> 00:17:04,219
Rym: Anyway, that is true.

270
00:17:04,721 --> 00:17:14,279
Rym: I mean when there are 40 gorges trying to make the jump that you have to be exactly perfectly time for Doesn't matter how good you are 40 gorges bring you down with the knee that breaks pulls ten men down.

271
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,434
Scott: Yes, that is correct.

272
00:17:16,555 --> 00:17:23,696
Scott: So yeah If you haven't already pre-ordered ns2 and there's something wrong with you go and pre-order it.

273
00:17:23,717 --> 00:17:36,366
Scott: if you can even pre-order 95% of people apparently have pre-ordered the deluxe version But you can pre-order the non deluxe version for like 20 bucks and you'll get access to this map maker and the map maker Alone is worth a lot more than 20 bucks.

274
00:17:36,667 --> 00:17:38,973
Scott: So sweet sweet deal right there.

275
00:17:39,495 --> 00:17:41,480
Rym: So speaking of games you can pre-order.

276
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,114
Rym: Apparently within the beta for heroes of new earth.

277
00:17:45,657 --> 00:17:48,989
Rym: you can Pre-order the game heroes of new earth.

278
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:53,688
Scott: I want to talk about a lot of I think a lot of betas do that You know, it's like hey, you're in the beta.

279
00:17:53,729 --> 00:17:55,480
Scott: You must care about this game, please pre-order.

280
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:01,240
Rym: Yeah I just I needed a lame segue to get into that game because we got beta keys and some formats are talking about it.

281
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:05,016
Rym: I played dota a bit back in the day and basically here's a new work.

282
00:18:05,056 --> 00:18:05,739
Rym: I have three ever.

283
00:18:06,563 --> 00:18:07,367
Rym: When I was a kid, I'd work.

284
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:08,433
Rym: I have one and two as well.

285
00:18:08,453 --> 00:18:10,102
Scott: I Don't know.

286
00:18:10,162 --> 00:18:11,530
Scott: I never saw you had Warcraft 3 ever.

287
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:14,218
Rym: I Have a lot of games.

288
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:23,064
Rym: Anyway, anyway, dota was this mod and basically it was kind of like a tower defense But not really.

289
00:18:23,084 --> 00:18:28,420
Rym: you control like one dude and you like run down a couple different areas and fight guys.

290
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,377
Rym: and it was kind of fun back in the day.

291
00:18:30,397 --> 00:18:42,800
Rym: and It's one of those games kind of like a we always pine for like tribes 2 or doom 2 or like these certain old like gaming Experiences like ah if only games they were exactly like a weapons factory back in the day.

292
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:56,100
Rym: well, the people who play dota have been saying the same thing about dota that we've been saying about our games and The shit talking stuff and some people long story short are making the spiritual successor to dota called heroes of new earth.

293
00:18:56,563 --> 00:19:02,880
Scott: There's actually a few games that are basically You know taking the same model of this, you know, pretty easy model.

294
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,150
Rym: I mean think it's basically everyone controls some sort of hero.

295
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:09,200
Rym: You have kind of World of Warcraft style fighting.

296
00:19:09,542 --> 00:19:11,475
Scott: It's an RTS where you control one guy.

297
00:19:11,516 --> 00:19:18,600
Rym: pretty much It's an RTS control one guy But it's also at both ends is basically gauntlet because you've got monster generators on both sides.

298
00:19:20,164 --> 00:19:23,954
Scott: The first dota was released in 2003 when we were at RIT.

299
00:19:23,994 --> 00:19:25,357
Scott: you never played it ever.

300
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:26,320
Rym: I played it.

301
00:19:27,104 --> 00:19:27,909
Scott: When did you play it?

302
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:28,534
Scott: I tried it.

303
00:19:28,554 --> 00:19:29,359
Rym: I didn't like it.

304
00:19:31,107 --> 00:19:36,272
Scott: I Remember I don't believe you've ever played the original defense of the agents.

305
00:19:36,493 --> 00:19:37,236
Rym: Have you ever played it?

306
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,285
Scott: I Saw my brother play it.

307
00:19:40,089 --> 00:19:42,280
Scott: He was big on the Warcraft 3, but I never played.

308
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:46,637
Rym: I was never good at Warcraft 3 or 2 or 1 or Starcraft.

309
00:19:46,717 --> 00:19:47,360
Scott: I was good.

310
00:19:47,842 --> 00:19:49,729
Scott: I was never good at Warcraft.

311
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,360
Rym: I'm not even talking good on the like among good players.

312
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:58,466
Rym: I'm talking like I would get trounced by pretty much anyone If I try to place.

313
00:19:58,486 --> 00:20:07,776
Scott: I could play Starcraft right and I open it up and I say new skirmish Which is just you know Basically a multiplayer game against the computer one-on-one against the AI on the basic map.

314
00:20:08,198 --> 00:20:15,620
Scott: no matter which class race I pick, you know protoss zerg or Terran I die pretty much immediately.

315
00:20:15,821 --> 00:20:16,683
Scott: There is nothing I have.

316
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:22,300
Scott: no I can play the single-player Starcraft and you know, eventually beat it, you know, that's weird.

317
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,608
Scott: It's like a single-player RTS, you know the campaign.

318
00:20:24,628 --> 00:20:28,020
Scott: I can sort of eventually win any one of them if I just keep playing.

319
00:20:28,841 --> 00:20:35,440
Scott: But the like actual multiplayer thing where two guys start blank, you know, and you just go I just die.

320
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,307
Scott: I can't do anything.

321
00:20:36,388 --> 00:20:40,860
Rym: the game was that the RTS like that I was the best at was actually command and conquer and red alert.

322
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,492
Scott: I was slightly better at command and conquer but not by.

323
00:20:43,513 --> 00:20:45,467
Rym: but even then my the only craft one I was.

324
00:20:45,488 --> 00:20:46,120
Scott: I was okay.

325
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:52,083
Rym: My only strategy was basically most of the people I played against were the kind of people who would like try to build this whole Base,

326
00:20:52,588 --> 00:20:54,623
Scott: so I just wanted to do I

327
00:20:54,844 --> 00:20:59,843
Rym: would just wait a little bit and then just send tanks and tanks and tanks and tanks and just destroy all their shit And win.

328
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:00,206
Rym: and that was it.

329
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:01,336
Scott: That's my problem, right?

330
00:21:01,396 --> 00:21:01,860
Scott: It's okay.

331
00:21:02,001 --> 00:21:03,430
Scott: I either you know, I'm trying to.

332
00:21:03,511 --> 00:21:04,900
Scott: I tried to build a base, right?

333
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,032
Scott: Well, the other guy sends units after me and I can't defend myself.

334
00:21:08,173 --> 00:21:09,980
Scott: Okay, so this time I'm gonna defend myself.

335
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:13,680
Scott: So I build some guys and then I start building my base, but the tanks just keep coming.

336
00:21:14,601 --> 00:21:18,060
Scott: They just keep coming and I'm like, how is he building so quickly?

337
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,502
Scott: It's like I built.

338
00:21:19,522 --> 00:21:25,180
Scott: so I'm like, okay, I'm gonna build as quickly as I possibly can and I try just one resource collector.

339
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,607
Scott: I'll try to resource collectors.

340
00:21:26,647 --> 00:21:27,270
Scott: I'll try three.

341
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:27,732
Scott: I'll try.

342
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:28,436
Rym: every reason.

343
00:21:28,596 --> 00:21:29,260
Rym: bad idea.

344
00:21:30,103 --> 00:21:34,480
Scott: One tank factory two tank factories one barracks two barracks three barracks.

345
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:45,284
Scott: I'll try every possible combination to get quicker building of units and None of them are anywhere even half as fast as the other thing is The AI.

346
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:47,590
Scott: the AI is faster than me and I'm like what.

347
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:51,060
Rym: I would say that maybe you're not clicking fast enough.

348
00:21:51,342 --> 00:21:51,845
Scott: It's done.

349
00:21:51,865 --> 00:21:54,200
Rym: I would say that maybe you're not clicking fast enough.

350
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:54,884
Rym: Like maybe you don't.

351
00:21:54,924 --> 00:21:57,600
Rym: you didn't memorize like exactly the timing of everything.

352
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:01,993
Rym: But I point out in advance Wars, which is turn-based.

353
00:22:02,394 --> 00:22:03,478
Rym: You have the same problem.

354
00:22:03,498 --> 00:22:09,014
Rym: You'll be like, yeah I got my two tanks Let's roll and I've already got like mega tanks on every city on the map.

355
00:22:09,054 --> 00:22:11,387
Rym: and I'm like pick is so long Starcraft.

356
00:22:11,427 --> 00:22:12,700
Scott: you can cue up the units.

357
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:17,762
Scott: You can be like build three of these and one of those and when that's done immediately start building this and I'll cue it All up.

358
00:22:17,943 --> 00:22:19,310
Scott: and it's still not fast.

359
00:22:19,331 --> 00:22:19,974
Scott: I'm like what.

360
00:22:20,336 --> 00:22:22,284
Scott: I have no clue What is good?

361
00:22:22,404 --> 00:22:25,555
Scott: I even watched like some Korean guys, you know videos on YouTube.

362
00:22:26,016 --> 00:22:26,458
Scott: No clue.

363
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:27,020
Scott: What's going on?

364
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,886
Rym: it's completely Right, but I don't want to.

365
00:22:31,287 --> 00:22:35,705
Rym: I don't want to really get into heroes the new earth because it's a beta and we played it a whole bunch.

366
00:22:35,745 --> 00:22:41,632
Rym: I'm still playing it every now and then but Regardless of the game which is basically to sum it up.

367
00:22:41,732 --> 00:22:44,200
Rym: I feel like they got all the wrong things, right?

368
00:22:44,761 --> 00:22:52,031
Rym: It's like they're trying to be so true to the origin to dota That they're like bringing all these old bad game mechanics forward.

369
00:22:52,072 --> 00:22:54,620
Rym: It's like they've forgotten what made games like that fun.

370
00:22:55,284 --> 00:23:02,078
Rym: It'd be like if I was making a new FPS like Team Fortress 2 styling and I bet wanted to base it on like mega TF.

371
00:23:02,199 --> 00:23:07,634
Rym: and What I took from mega TF was like bad graphics and broken controls.

372
00:23:07,674 --> 00:23:09,199
Rym: I was like, that's what made it a good game.

373
00:23:10,581 --> 00:23:19,330
Scott: yeah, I think the people in general they just don't when they're they're making games that are sequels or You know Homages or anything like.

374
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:24,616
Scott: if someone made an xcom now They wouldn't put less things in it than the original xcom had.

375
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:25,540
Scott: they would always add more.

376
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,551
Scott: It's like oh we got to add, you know more different weapons.

377
00:23:28,591 --> 00:23:30,940
Scott: We got to add more different units or they boil it down.

378
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,260
Rym: They're like, what if we just make it an FPS?

379
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,322
Rym: Yeah, right.

380
00:23:35,603 --> 00:23:38,011
Rym: Let me look at two examples Actraiser Actraiser one.

381
00:23:38,232 --> 00:23:40,740
Rym: There was the pretty crappy side-scroller.

382
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:49,780
Rym: It wasn't that bad compared to other side-scrollers and the fun but kind of mindless town part But everyone kind of liked the town part and people were like wow Actraiser was really popular.

383
00:23:50,242 --> 00:23:51,085
Rym: Let's make a sequel.

384
00:23:51,647 --> 00:23:52,893
Rym: Oh, but we got to get rid of something.

385
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:54,097
Rym: Yeah, get rid of that town part.

386
00:23:54,138 --> 00:23:56,786
Rym: No one liked that We wanted.

387
00:23:56,947 --> 00:23:57,592
Scott: we wanted a game.

388
00:23:57,632 --> 00:23:58,559
Scott: That was only the town.

389
00:24:00,863 --> 00:24:07,792
Rym: Oh my god, imagine versus Actraiser with versus platforming - oh Man, I want that both.

390
00:24:08,215 --> 00:24:17,539
Scott: Yeah versus Actraiser straight up, you know, but it's like when you make a Modern, you know remake of a game like you're gonna make a mule today, right?

391
00:24:18,305 --> 00:24:20,039
Scott: Mule was pretty great and there was you know.

392
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:28,820
Scott: But you remove you don't add you remove the bad and you polish the good You don't add and you really have to consider what made the game good.

393
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:50,168
Rym: I mean the bidding mechanic in mule was really really good But the choosing land mechanic was really really really bad and it's not even like we can say Oh well like the kids or the amateurs or like the anime situation where When the fans who grew up in consuming the media are the ones making the media they like lose perspective Because Nintendo even is guilty of this.

394
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:54,160
Rym: Wario ware on the GameCube was like one of the greatest games ever.

395
00:24:54,241 --> 00:24:55,414
Rym: It was crazy popular.

396
00:24:55,455 --> 00:24:55,758
Rym: It was like.

397
00:24:56,781 --> 00:24:59,039
Rym: People loved that game as a party game.

398
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:10,500
Rym: Yeah, but I'm not sure how many other people I see a lot of other people really liked it in the same way that a lot Of people like Mario Party like I think was a similar vibe, but then they're like, yeah, that game was really popular.

399
00:25:10,921 --> 00:25:16,280
Rym: Let's take out all the parts that people actually like and put it all this bullshit that we thought they liked.

400
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:19,635
Rym: It's like they didn't have any clue why people like the original game.

401
00:25:19,655 --> 00:25:26,271
Rym: Yeah Anyway, yeah, but that all that aside I mean dota either and it will HON.

402
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:27,296
Rym: you're there like it or don't?

403
00:25:27,316 --> 00:25:27,980
Rym: is that kind of game?

404
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:42,160
Rym: But any of those kinds of games I have to I have to warn everyone out there regardless of any factor in the game itself a Game is shaped by and shapes the community of people who play it and every game has a different community.

405
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:52,975
Rym: I mean you look at Counter-Strike kids with their faggotry and you look at NS people, yeah, the NS people with their gorg cheese jumping.

406
00:25:53,216 --> 00:25:54,920
Rym: Yeah, every community is different.

407
00:25:55,925 --> 00:26:02,774
Rym: I've never in my entire life Run into a more shit-headed gaming community than that that is.

408
00:26:02,815 --> 00:26:10,960
Rym: within the HON beta These people made Counter-Strike look like a paragon of ivory tower righteousness and politeness.

409
00:26:11,911 --> 00:26:15,180
Rym: Yeah a Good fucking god.

410
00:26:15,641 --> 00:26:21,280
Rym: I I've never been sworn at so much over a voice chat that barely worked ever.

411
00:26:21,761 --> 00:26:23,747
Rym: Then in the fly time I played.

412
00:26:23,827 --> 00:26:30,557
Scott: I think the problem the problem is is basically right is that this is a game that's you know five on five right.

413
00:26:30,577 --> 00:26:35,390
Scott: and You know in NS Let's say someone on your team is stupid and they're an alien.

414
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:36,734
Scott: they don't spend their resources.

415
00:26:36,775 --> 00:26:40,979
Scott: that hurts your team pretty bad But it doesn't completely ruin your team.

416
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,582
Scott: Completely right.

417
00:26:42,682 --> 00:26:44,968
Scott: it's not ultra devastating in this game.

418
00:26:45,028 --> 00:26:51,227
Scott: the dota and the dota's like games if it's five on five or even worse Like three on three or two on two.

419
00:26:51,951 --> 00:26:53,979
Scott: if you're really good, right?

420
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,362
Scott: You can't.

421
00:26:55,382 --> 00:26:57,330
Scott: there's nothing you can do to carry the team.

422
00:26:57,511 --> 00:26:59,700
Scott: you need everyone on your team to be good.

423
00:26:59,861 --> 00:27:02,299
Scott: So if one person sucks, right?

424
00:27:03,101 --> 00:27:04,911
Scott: You basically lose no matter what you do.

425
00:27:04,931 --> 00:27:12,300
Scott: It's kind of like Left 4 Dead Sort of yeah, so if they suck you're gonna kick them, right?

426
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:19,050
Scott: So noobs have a hard time getting into the game because anytime they try to join a game to get kicked All right, but it's goes so much worse than that.

427
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,677
Rym: I mean the first time I play another problem.

428
00:27:20,697 --> 00:27:22,359
Rym: I was like, all right I've never played before.

429
00:27:23,401 --> 00:27:24,906
Rym: So I joined a noob.

430
00:27:25,207 --> 00:27:29,279
Rym: only it was like first timers noob only four on four.

431
00:27:30,302 --> 00:27:35,939
Rym: So I join it the game starts I get sworn at and kicked within 30 seconds.

432
00:27:37,377 --> 00:27:45,389
Rym: I because I Walk like basically I walked around a little bit and someone was like, oh my god He's not buying something something something.

433
00:27:45,449 --> 00:27:46,795
Rym: and then they swore at me and then they kicked me.

434
00:27:47,639 --> 00:27:53,660
Scott: Yep Also, I played a bunch of games against people I knew who were also noobs, right?

435
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,458
Scott: So I actually won a lot of games, you know.

436
00:27:57,337 --> 00:28:03,541
Scott: and Then I tried to go find some noob games against internet people and I got kicked out of a game that I was too noobish for.

437
00:28:04,163 --> 00:28:08,258
Scott: and then I found a server that was like noobs only but if they had a number there's like a score.

438
00:28:08,278 --> 00:28:09,904
Scott: you have that Like rates how good you are.

439
00:28:10,566 --> 00:28:16,440
Scott: and my score was kind of high because I had won a bunch of games against people even though They were against noobs, right?

440
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:23,735
Scott: so my score was like 1500 something and they were like Everyone at the title of the server or like the game was like 1400, you know or less.

441
00:28:25,501 --> 00:28:34,390
Scott: So anyone who had a score higher than 1400 they automatically kicked them before they even started the game and I was like I joined 1500 but I'm like, dude, I'm a total noob.

442
00:28:34,771 --> 00:28:37,583
Scott: Do not kick me, you know, and they So I was.

443
00:28:37,884 --> 00:28:39,151
Rym: I was a noob.

444
00:28:40,901 --> 00:28:47,043
Scott: But because they put so much value in this little ranking number that you have That's the whole problem The community like.

445
00:28:47,083 --> 00:28:52,760
Rym: if they're so focused on these stats and like the win/loss ratios that people are just the shit.

446
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,730
Rym: Cockery knows no bounds.

447
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:56,459
Rym: YouTube comments are more civil.

448
00:28:57,282 --> 00:29:04,465
Scott: I mean Blood Bowl has also has like a score right but the score in Blood Bowl is not a how good you are score It's a house.

449
00:29:04,605 --> 00:29:07,700
Scott: It's like a how many points in your Warhammer army score, you know.

450
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:10,359
Scott: It's like I've got you know, super awesome players on my team.

451
00:29:10,942 --> 00:29:15,300
Scott: So you don't want to play against me if your team isn't leveled up yet, you know, that's what that score is.

452
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,026
Scott: So that makes sense, you know.

453
00:29:17,428 --> 00:29:20,500
Scott: and people could just start a new army whenever they want in blood war a new team.

454
00:29:20,681 --> 00:29:23,884
Scott: So you could just if you want to play with people who have you know Leveled up guys.

455
00:29:23,904 --> 00:29:36,777
Scott: You just make a new team every time you play and you'll always have a basic Football team with no levels or skills special crap or anything like that, you know, and some people do that They're like, hey, you know a thousand point army, you know teams only and that's all they do.

456
00:29:37,621 --> 00:29:42,039
Scott: But other people level up their teams and they're like three thousand point teams, you know.

457
00:29:42,901 --> 00:29:45,005
Scott: So whatever but doesn't it?

458
00:29:45,466 --> 00:29:48,995
Rym: the community in that game is Almost enough to make it.

459
00:29:49,155 --> 00:29:51,663
Rym: unless you play with friends like straight-up friends.

460
00:29:52,145 --> 00:29:53,168
Rym: It is impossible to play.

461
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:53,810
Rym: don't even try.

462
00:29:55,854 --> 00:29:56,943
Scott: Well, it's a closed beta.

463
00:29:57,023 --> 00:30:01,645
Scott: so, you know There are other games in that you can get Warcraft 3 and then get the original dota.

464
00:30:02,107 --> 00:30:07,940
Scott: I think there's also Some a mod like this for the dawn of war games.

465
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:08,601
Scott: I'm not sure.

466
00:30:08,621 --> 00:30:17,356
Rym: and I find my Warcraft 3 and play it again that you don't have yeah, and then There's All the way back.

467
00:30:17,396 --> 00:30:18,786
Rym: you just straight up like command-and-conquer.

468
00:30:19,711 --> 00:30:21,797
Rym: Wanna play some versus command-and-conquer a DOS box.

469
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,708
Scott: I get we could but I have no skills.

470
00:30:25,728 --> 00:30:31,569
Scott: that I was thinking maybe we should buy, you know, the What's it called the new red alert?

471
00:30:32,411 --> 00:30:37,389
Scott: Yeah, like the new red alert game, but I played the demo of it and it was a fast clicking, you know.

472
00:30:37,731 --> 00:30:38,152
Scott: Maybe we should.

473
00:30:38,232 --> 00:30:38,814
Rym: you know, it's not.

474
00:30:38,854 --> 00:30:43,229
Rym: you got a master turn-based strategy games before we move into the RTS is with you.

475
00:30:44,091 --> 00:30:50,216
Scott: Maybe we should just play like, you know Starcraft just plain old Starcraft and I could just somehow Figure it the fuck out.

476
00:30:50,397 --> 00:30:56,401
Rym: I pretty much just throw zerglings and if you can overcome my strategy Which is throw zerglings as fast as I can.

477
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:57,546
Rym: I got nothing.

478
00:30:57,566 --> 00:30:58,229
Rym: That's all I do.

479
00:30:59,171 --> 00:30:59,980
Rym: It's the same thing.

480
00:31:00,001 --> 00:31:00,830
Rym: You know, what was that game?

481
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:07,433
Rym: Were you like you throw the bases from the bases and then like they're all connected by chains We play that.

482
00:31:07,613 --> 00:31:11,310
Scott: Oh moon base commander that games actually really good because it's like scorched earth.

483
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:15,690
Rym: But the problem with that game was all I would do is there's a little like creeper mines.

484
00:31:16,011 --> 00:31:21,550
Rym: I would basically just send them constantly because a lot of people couldn't deal with them because they couldn't aim their little shops.

485
00:31:21,933 --> 00:31:23,929
Rym: So anyone who wasn't actually good at the game that would be.

486
00:31:26,311 --> 00:31:27,576
Rym: That was my only strategy.

487
00:31:27,877 --> 00:31:31,070
Rym: if you could defeat that that you could just like march over and destroy my base.

488
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:32,118
Rym: There's nothing I could do about it.

489
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,610
Rym: I couldn't hit anything.

490
00:31:34,652 --> 00:31:41,330
Scott: Yeah, there's basically another game that's in this same genre But it's it's one of those games where it's free.

491
00:31:41,491 --> 00:31:45,750
Scott: But if you pay money, you just get better guy you get better heroes for paying real money.

492
00:31:46,011 --> 00:31:47,096
Scott: So it's not.

493
00:31:47,116 --> 00:31:48,683
Scott: I don't think that's one you want to play now.

494
00:31:48,763 --> 00:31:50,370
Scott: probably I forget what it's called though.

495
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:54,188
Rym: So if you want to play a game like this, I feel like yours of new earth is the best.

496
00:31:54,289 --> 00:31:57,722
Rym: but That's like saying that World of Warcraft is the best MMO.

497
00:31:57,822 --> 00:32:11,757
Rym: It is 100% true Okay But anyway things of the day.

498
00:32:12,058 --> 00:32:14,144
Rym: do not watch my thing of the day.

499
00:32:14,204 --> 00:32:19,885
Rym: if you have not yet seen the Ultimate sci-fi classic total recall with Arnold Schwarzenegger.

500
00:32:19,905 --> 00:32:22,977
Rym: It is It is a great movie.

501
00:32:23,198 --> 00:32:24,965
Scott: Instead you should get your ass to Mars.

502
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:27,910
Rym: Get your ass to Mars Start the reactor.

503
00:32:29,112 --> 00:32:29,875
Rym: God that movie.

504
00:32:30,478 --> 00:32:33,210
Rym: This is one of those videos of every blank from blank.

505
00:32:33,752 --> 00:32:37,649
Rym: It's every death in total recall including those goldfish.

506
00:32:39,693 --> 00:32:40,778
Rym: It is so great.

507
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:47,982
Rym: I and you know, I like this movie but it totally reeks of early 90s action movie gunfights.

508
00:32:48,524 --> 00:32:52,969
Rym: a lot of people die a Lot more than I remembered dying.

509
00:32:54,191 --> 00:32:56,178
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know the movie is like.

510
00:32:56,238 --> 00:33:00,905
Scott: it's actually separate from the action parts, you know It's it's.

511
00:33:01,208 --> 00:33:09,410
Scott: you know You seem to remember like all the sort of highbrow sci-fi stuff that goes on in it because it's probably the highest brow Schwarzenegger sci-fi action movie there is.

512
00:33:10,251 --> 00:33:13,743
Scott: But see you remember that because that's the part that really hits you emotionally.

513
00:33:13,763 --> 00:33:15,630
Rym: forget when he's got the the movie.

514
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:19,681
Scott: It basically is discovered in action scenes and bullets flying everywhere.

515
00:33:19,701 --> 00:33:23,835
Rym: He stabs that dude with that thing near the end right to the face Yep.

516
00:33:24,297 --> 00:33:25,784
Rym: Yeah, and then that guy explodes.

517
00:33:26,086 --> 00:33:26,930
Rym: It's good movie.

518
00:33:27,492 --> 00:33:31,685
Rym: But if you've seen total recall, this is every death in total recall.

519
00:33:31,705 --> 00:33:34,889
Rym: the movie is some minutes long In fact, it's almost four minutes long

520
00:33:35,554 --> 00:33:51,723
Scott: Yep, so despite, you know The awesomeness that is like I don't know the mouse guard RPG and despite the awesomeness that is burning wheel It is still my opinion that the greatest role-playing Game book ever created is the second edition Monster Manual.

521
00:33:51,883 --> 00:33:53,808
Rym: There's something beautiful about that book.

522
00:33:53,928 --> 00:33:54,430
Rym: regardless

523
00:33:54,891 --> 00:34:11,097
Scott: Regardless of you know the game second edition Dungeons and Dragons and what you might think about that game that Monster manual just as a work of art and a book on its own regardless, you know, even if you take all the gameplay mechanics out of it is Such an amazing book.

524
00:34:11,157 --> 00:34:15,938
Scott: not only does have a ton of monsters in it one per page By the way, you'd learn a lesson.

525
00:34:16,078 --> 00:34:21,414
Scott: third edition Monster Manuals and fourth edition Monster Manuals One monster per page.

526
00:34:21,896 --> 00:34:30,627
Scott: an amazing really cool piece of fantasy artwork for each monster Right now not for some of the monsters all of the monsters every single one.

527
00:34:30,726 --> 00:34:53,022
Rym: I also point out I just want to point out that a lot of the monsters were kind of risque in this weird way like I was thumbing through because I have my second had Monster Manual and like the level of detail it goes into as to like what kelpies do to you and Like some of those like weird plants and something there.

528
00:34:53,042 --> 00:34:53,583
Rym: I don't know.

529
00:34:53,603 --> 00:34:55,389
Rym: There's some weird stuff going on in that book.

530
00:34:55,469 --> 00:35:10,106
Rym: I gotta look up some of the people who wrote the actual text with the sheer number quantity the variety of the monsters and the you know, the the non Game related details about yeah, like all the ecology and everything.

531
00:35:10,267 --> 00:35:19,119
Scott: It's like the most imaginative Like a bestiary I think to ever exist on the entire history of.

532
00:35:19,539 --> 00:35:29,362
Scott: you know Fictional bestiary to ever exist, you know, and so it's such a great book, you know I I don't know why I don't have a copy of it.

533
00:35:29,422 --> 00:35:30,247
Scott: I probably should get one.

534
00:35:30,267 --> 00:35:32,869
Rym: I Daddy two copies.

535
00:35:34,992 --> 00:35:37,383
Rym: I think I do have to actually because I have.

536
00:35:37,403 --> 00:35:38,690
Rym: I have like one that was busted.

537
00:35:41,351 --> 00:35:43,420
Rym: I've won this in slightly less bad condition.

538
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,710
Scott: I'll try to find like a really good condition one.

539
00:35:45,931 --> 00:35:48,819
Rym: I also have the old binder with all the inserts.

540
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,407
Scott: I'm in sort of a. I don't like the binder.

541
00:35:51,427 --> 00:35:53,253
Scott: I like the book Plus.

542
00:35:53,273 --> 00:35:54,476
Scott: the binder is too many months.

543
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:59,270
Rym: Yeah, I realized all my second at D&D books will not fit in a single book box.

544
00:36:00,334 --> 00:36:04,250
Rym: Now many book boxes stupid skills and powers and all that bullshit.

545
00:36:04,671 --> 00:36:12,236
Scott: so some guy named Dan meth at least that's his name on Vimeo and it said yeah, he's He made a music video.

546
00:36:12,276 --> 00:36:19,396
Scott: He made a song and an accompanying music video called monster manual, which is a You know, it's.

547
00:36:19,717 --> 00:36:23,606
Scott: it's a send-up for this amazing book and the song.

548
00:36:23,706 --> 00:36:25,310
Scott: honestly, I'm not a big fan of the song.

549
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:29,330
Scott: It's not the greatest song at musically speaking, but it's fun.

550
00:36:29,651 --> 00:36:41,157
Scott: and it talks about the monster manual and they have cute artwork in the video and The lyrics are pretty good too because you know, he talks about how the monster can see in both, you know Aerial planes and he.

551
00:36:41,278 --> 00:36:45,390
Scott: you know how the the beholder lives mostly underground and such-and-such.

552
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:49,425
Rym: I put it on the same level as that Super Mario RPG video.

553
00:36:49,445 --> 00:36:50,449
Rym: We use way back in the day.

554
00:36:51,393 --> 00:36:52,136
Scott: I don't remember that one.

555
00:36:52,378 --> 00:36:54,246
Rym: You don't remember that one here in the forest.

556
00:36:54,346 --> 00:36:55,150
Rym: It's very scary.

557
00:36:55,431 --> 00:36:59,690
Rym: Okay, yeah that one I feel like it's on the same level of quality.

558
00:37:00,571 --> 00:37:04,950
Scott: Let's see how much the monster manual is gonna find one on the Amazons or the eBay's.

559
00:37:05,811 --> 00:37:08,082
Scott: I'm coming up with all the third and fourth edition ones.

560
00:37:08,223 --> 00:37:09,931
Scott: Ah, I Got it.

561
00:37:09,971 --> 00:37:11,496
Scott: I got to do some better searching.

562
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:20,970
Rym: So while all Scott's doing that the meta minute GeekNights is odd super bonus double secret probation hiatus for a while.

563
00:37:21,452 --> 00:37:39,209
Rym: So we're doing shows whenever we feel like it and Scott's coming in over Skype and the studio over here is a mess as I'm slowly packing up the house to give it up and probably by January sometime GeekNights is gonna be back to normal scheduled normal audio quality normal everything.

564
00:37:39,229 --> 00:37:45,910
Rym: and Actually, I think the show is going to improve in quality quite a bit because I'm gonna get an extra two hours of sleep every night.

565
00:37:47,371 --> 00:37:51,003
Scott: Oh, this guy has a used like new copy on Amazon for $16.

566
00:37:51,003 --> 00:37:52,789
Rym: that might be worth it.

567
00:37:53,691 --> 00:37:53,992
Scott: Let's see.

568
00:37:54,052 --> 00:37:55,035
Scott: Oh, there's new ones.

569
00:37:55,376 --> 00:37:57,341
Scott: Oh from the new ones.

570
00:37:57,542 --> 00:37:59,106
Scott: The cheapest new one is $34 and 18 cents.

571
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,241
Rym: You probably want the slightly used one.

572
00:38:02,281 --> 00:38:04,835
Rym: as long as it does not like that Used ones.

573
00:38:04,855 --> 00:38:06,401
Scott: you can get used ones for eight bucks.

574
00:38:06,783 --> 00:38:08,630
Scott: used good condition seven dollars and eight.

575
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:11,689
Rym: Well, watch out I bought that used Prince of Nothing book.

576
00:38:12,632 --> 00:38:18,730
Rym: And it said like pretty used what used good used very good used except it said like used acceptable something like that.

577
00:38:18,851 --> 00:38:24,169
Rym: But it was perfectly fine Except that it smelled like fried fish.

578
00:38:24,811 --> 00:38:32,390
Rym: Like really really really strongly of fried fish to the point that I eventually threw it away because it smelled so much like fried fish.

579
00:38:32,791 --> 00:38:36,064
Rym: I didn't want it stinking up the rest of my books as it was funny.

580
00:38:36,084 --> 00:38:37,770
Scott: There's plenty of used copies in Amazon.

581
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:38,393
Scott: I'm sure I'll.

582
00:38:38,755 --> 00:38:43,758
Scott: maybe I could pick up a cup, you know, I'm in a no money spending mode So, I don't know if I should buy one now.

583
00:38:43,798 --> 00:38:44,722
Scott: I don't really eat it.

584
00:38:45,324 --> 00:38:45,605
Rym: meta.

585
00:38:45,686 --> 00:38:51,044
Rym: a minute aside What else do we have in the meta shows gonna be back on track in January?

586
00:38:51,064 --> 00:38:52,750
Rym: We don't have any contests going on.

587
00:38:54,694 --> 00:38:58,046
Scott: Well, we don't have any contest but Scott really likes cornucopia.

588
00:38:58,086 --> 00:38:59,250
Rym: is gonna spoil that right now.

589
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:11,713
Scott: Cornucopia is a totally awesome and it was a couple years ago that I said Hey everybody make some geeky cornucopias for Thanksgiving and I know it's the day before Thanksgiving and in fact you this will probably go You'll if you're.

590
00:39:11,834 --> 00:39:15,190
Scott: you're probably not downloading this late at night unless you're a super fan.

591
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:23,870
Scott: So you're probably getting this on Thanksgiving or afterwards, but regardless If you make a geeky cornucopia, that would be totally awesome.

592
00:39:24,251 --> 00:39:25,537
Scott: Send a picture a video.

593
00:39:25,778 --> 00:39:28,810
Scott: you could just make a picture instead of actually making an actual cornucopia.

594
00:39:28,931 --> 00:39:33,295
Scott: also, you know just Photoshop something and It would be totally awesome.

595
00:39:33,515 --> 00:39:37,929
Scott: Nobody has even come close to the quality of the boo cornucopia, which is the best.

596
00:39:38,873 --> 00:39:41,482
Scott: But yeah, yeah cornucopias are totally sweet.

597
00:39:41,702 --> 00:39:42,224
Scott: I like them.

598
00:39:42,325 --> 00:39:43,689
Scott: send me one I'll be happy.

599
00:39:44,392 --> 00:39:47,040
Rym: Once again, we are in charge of panels for ConnectiCon.

600
00:39:47,361 --> 00:39:53,658
Rym: there's going to be a lot more gaming content at ConnectiCon next summer And panel submissions are open for ConnectiCon.

601
00:39:53,698 --> 00:39:56,404
Rym: so send us your panel ideas and the.

602
00:39:56,685 --> 00:40:03,710
Scott: the current book club selection is The hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy by Douglas Adams.

603
00:40:04,439 --> 00:40:05,209
Scott: Just the first book.

604
00:40:06,833 --> 00:40:09,410
Rym: I'm surprised you paused that long and did you say Douglas?

605
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:13,364
Rym: Douglas, I don't think anyone gets that.

606
00:40:13,485 --> 00:40:14,149
Rym: I think that's too.

607
00:40:15,132 --> 00:40:18,061
Scott: I think that some of the listeners get Douglas.

608
00:40:18,181 --> 00:40:20,508
Rym: Hi kids if you get that email us.

609
00:40:20,548 --> 00:40:21,070
Rym: I'm curious.

610
00:40:21,933 --> 00:40:28,379
Rym: I'm sure someone gets email us and explain why we say Douglas the way that we do That's not easily Google a bull.

611
00:40:28,942 --> 00:40:30,598
Scott: So that's not Google Google.

612
00:40:33,051 --> 00:40:44,930
Rym: So back in the day right long long time ago the day when I had quake one and A dial-up connection and then I switched to a cable modem.

613
00:40:45,673 --> 00:40:53,749
Rym: So I have quake one and a cable modem and I had never played quake one online before Because previously with the dial-up I couldn't make that shit work.

614
00:40:54,372 --> 00:40:57,266
Scott: You want you could dial your friend directly and play against each other.

615
00:40:57,286 --> 00:41:01,479
Rym: I did that with doom - I did that with command and conquer.

616
00:41:01,499 --> 00:41:03,988
Scott: I did it with like heretic and hexen.

617
00:41:04,289 --> 00:41:07,990
Rym: actually I have kind of a funny anecdote about that because I used to also play a lot.

618
00:41:08,454 --> 00:41:10,110
Rym: Where you could do this serialized thing?

619
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:15,346
Rym: We're like you connect to one person Locally with a serial cable and use the server thing and then you dial to someone else.

620
00:41:15,386 --> 00:41:16,350
Rym: you could play with like three people.

621
00:41:17,631 --> 00:41:21,270
Rym: But yeah, it barely worked, but a lot of the null modem cable.

622
00:41:21,795 --> 00:41:24,475
Rym: I had a null modem cable and in fact we had two computers now.

623
00:41:24,516 --> 00:41:37,775
Rym: so very often my brother and I would play either command and conquer or Doom against each other but we always had they gotta bring that option back where you can just take a USB cable connect two computers and Directly and then you know.

624
00:41:38,377 --> 00:41:49,604
Scott: because right now because think about it, right if you have two laptops in a in like a Starbucks crossover cable people don't have a crossover cable What I do in fact, I carry one in my bag.

625
00:41:49,644 --> 00:41:51,739
Rym: It's one foot long Everywhere with you.

626
00:41:51,840 --> 00:42:00,737
Scott: Yeah, this is one foot long More than once all right, so even if you had the crossover cable and you connect the two laptops the network cards It's not trivial.

627
00:42:00,757 --> 00:42:05,254
Scott: It doesn't just automatically go doodoo and just work you have to do Wait, wait, wait, wait.

628
00:42:05,274 --> 00:42:07,982
Rym: Scott you think a null modem just fucking worked.

629
00:42:08,664 --> 00:42:14,581
Scott: No, what I'm saying is if they made USB cables they would they could make it with a driver.

630
00:42:14,701 --> 00:42:16,728
Scott: just work, you know for game.

631
00:42:17,049 --> 00:42:19,136
Rym: anyway I've got command and conquer.

632
00:42:19,156 --> 00:42:20,341
Rym: We always had to like take turns.

633
00:42:20,581 --> 00:42:22,910
Rym: who use the 486 and who use the Pentium Pro?

634
00:42:23,862 --> 00:42:29,010
Rym: so My brother was on the Pentium Pro Or the 486 and I'm on the Pentium Pro.

635
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:35,463
Rym: We're playing command and conquer and every now and then the Pentium Pro would screw up and like the mouse driver would just like go Whack and sometimes the 486 would too.

636
00:42:36,677 --> 00:42:44,286
Rym: but in this case the 486 like while we're playing his mouse drivers went whack and the mouse is like going all over the place and he couldn't click on anything anymore in the middle of this game.

637
00:42:44,306 --> 00:42:47,526
Rym: and He's like this command and conquer game sucks.

638
00:42:47,546 --> 00:42:48,050
Rym: We got to stop.

639
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:59,485
Rym: I can't click on anything anymore, and I was like so I guess it's just Conquer She's there was no more command And he was like, yeah, whatever and then he turned off the game.

640
00:42:59,525 --> 00:43:00,129
Rym: That was the end of that.

641
00:43:01,691 --> 00:43:15,970
Rym: But I was playing quick one online For the first time ever and I found the IP address of a server On a website on a website and I connected to it and I ran around immediately.

642
00:43:16,112 --> 00:43:23,030
Rym: Well, no, I ran around just fine But my guy kept like stuttering and staggering and then there was no good netcode back in the day.

643
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:29,540
Rym: So I clicked shoot to shoot a rocket and like two seconds later a rocket came out of my guy.

644
00:43:31,311 --> 00:43:33,538
Scott: Man the first time I tried to play a game online.

645
00:43:33,558 --> 00:43:37,873
Scott: See I didn't have a cable modem until I didn't have good internet That wasn't.

646
00:43:37,974 --> 00:43:40,590
Scott: that was faster than 56k until I got to RIT.

647
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:44,093
Scott: I mean I had used faster internet at school But not in my house.

648
00:43:44,535 --> 00:43:48,210
Scott: and it wasn't until after I'd been to college that my parents got some DSLs, you know.

649
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:51,730
Scott: But I did have my very own 56k modem on my very own phone line.

650
00:43:52,071 --> 00:43:57,206
Scott: So the house, you know, the modem downstairs did not interfere with me before the cable modem.

651
00:43:57,226 --> 00:44:02,676
Rym: We had two phone lines, but 336 modem That sucked.

652
00:44:03,442 --> 00:44:06,180
Scott: Yeah, so I had my very own K-modem actually still have.

653
00:44:06,402 --> 00:44:07,549
Scott: or did I give it to Scott Johnson?

654
00:44:09,392 --> 00:44:14,929
Rym: I don't know if you gave if he wanted it or if you just put it in a box He was taking to his house, but I think he's got it.

655
00:44:15,592 --> 00:44:15,973
Scott: I don't know.

656
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:18,842
Scott: but that was my modem and I could.

657
00:44:19,103 --> 00:44:21,250
Scott: I couldn't really play that many games online.

658
00:44:21,331 --> 00:44:27,992
Scott: I could play Diablo 2 online because that didn't really Pretty much.

659
00:44:28,434 --> 00:44:37,669
Scott: I tried to play half-life online and basically what would happen is you would I would start up and I would appear Right, and then I would just be standing still and I couldn't move at all.

660
00:44:38,111 --> 00:44:40,562
Scott: Right, and I didn't realize what the hell was wrong.

661
00:44:40,602 --> 00:44:49,350
Scott: I thought my thing was broken, you know Cuz Diablo 2 worked online for the 60 modem tribes to actually surprisingly worked with the 16 modem.

662
00:44:49,491 --> 00:44:53,770
Rym: Surprisingly well, it was kind of like scary really good netcode.

663
00:44:53,890 --> 00:45:03,008
Rym: But at RIT I realized oh is just because my you know, yeah you see you guys all forget We're like highly paid New York City computer professionals.

664
00:45:03,049 --> 00:45:11,749
Rym: now there was a time my friends when we were Stupid because you see the Rockets came out of my quick guy like two seconds after I hit the button and everything was all stuttery.

665
00:45:12,351 --> 00:45:22,564
Rym: So I went to the forum that I got the server IP address from and I was like what the F I'm trying to play online but the Rockets come out of me like two seconds after.

666
00:45:22,584 --> 00:45:24,390
Rym: is something wrong with the server?

667
00:45:24,492 --> 00:45:25,406
Rym: Why is it doing this?

668
00:45:26,892 --> 00:45:31,454
Rym: And someone else responded they're like, yeah the same thing happens to me, but that happens on every server I play on.

669
00:45:31,756 --> 00:45:33,488
Rym: I think you have to change something in your game.

670
00:45:33,508 --> 00:45:41,230
Rym: and This thread goes on for a little while and then this guy posts and he basically says oh my fucking god Are you guys serious or you're just trolling?

671
00:45:44,139 --> 00:45:46,253
Rym: And Long story short.

672
00:45:46,414 --> 00:45:56,666
Rym: I learned about the word ping and then I used Alta Vista and I learned about latency And I learned about hops and I learned about IPs and I learned

673
00:45:57,027 --> 00:45:57,930
Scott: that ping

674
00:45:58,371 --> 00:45:59,956
Rym: Sucked and I decided

675
00:45:59,976 --> 00:46:00,357
Scott: that

676
00:46:00,417 --> 00:46:05,030
Rym: I would never ever in my life accept a ping greater than a hundred.

677
00:46:06,234 --> 00:46:09,639
Rym: Yeah, I mean basically Ping greater than one.

678
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:11,325
Rym: you had fucking problems with quake one.

679
00:46:11,365 --> 00:46:12,510
Rym: that netcode was useless.

680
00:46:13,112 --> 00:46:18,288
Scott: Yeah, I mean for those of you who are not familiar with the technical details, right and many people are not.

681
00:46:18,489 --> 00:46:21,549
Scott: you know Is that when it comes to internet speed?

682
00:46:21,991 --> 00:46:24,117
Scott: Right, there are actually two different factors.

683
00:46:24,137 --> 00:46:24,879
Scott: You have to worry about.

684
00:46:24,899 --> 00:46:26,543
Scott: there is bandwidth and latency.

685
00:46:26,624 --> 00:46:26,804
Scott: right.

686
00:46:26,904 --> 00:46:31,870
Scott: bandwidth is how fast you know How much data can you get in a unit of time?

687
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:38,650
Scott: So if you have a bandwidth of five megabits per second, you can download 10 megabits of data in two seconds, right?

688
00:46:38,731 --> 00:46:39,462
Scott: It's simple math.

689
00:46:40,271 --> 00:46:49,549
Scott: Latency is the time it takes for a packet to go all the way from your computer to the destination And for the response to come all the way back, right?

690
00:46:50,012 --> 00:46:51,076
Scott: So let's say I'm gonna.

691
00:46:51,357 --> 00:46:54,390
Scott: I want to download 10 megabits from Rym, right?

692
00:46:54,890 --> 00:47:02,870
Scott: I send him a message like, you know It goes all the way across the internet to his computer and says give Scott the 10 megabit file.

693
00:47:02,991 --> 00:47:14,669
Scott: Then he sends over the 10 megabit file And as soon as the you know from the time the 10 megabit file the beginning of it touches my computer It'll come in really fast because I have lots of bandwidth, you know.

694
00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:18,002
Rym: I hope that to most people are rolling their eyes at this.

695
00:47:18,163 --> 00:47:18,745
Rym: I really hope

696
00:47:19,347 --> 00:47:33,504
Scott: I hope but That message the amount of time it might take to get to Rym and for the file You know for the front of the file to get all the way back to me could actually be a really long time So it actually won't start downloading for like a second.

697
00:47:33,624 --> 00:47:35,713
Rym: Maybe now here's an interesting thing I realize.

698
00:47:35,774 --> 00:47:47,270
Rym: now, you know, I went I keep by the time I went to RIT I already had a pretty wide knowledge of computing and like network stuff and Almost all of that came from trying to play games.

699
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:50,125
Rym: I mean all I learned about IPS and something

700
00:47:50,185 --> 00:47:53,203
Scott: pretty much everything I know about computers and trying to make games work

701
00:47:53,304 --> 00:48:02,689
Rym: on old DOS PCs yep, and even in Windows like IP addresses and networking and connecting to servers and like a latency and hops and packet loss and

702
00:48:03,232 --> 00:48:08,723
Scott: the desire to play a game Motivates the gate the PC gamer to learn about how computers work.

703
00:48:08,763 --> 00:48:14,230
Rym: and I think I'm gonna say Motivated because you really don't have to know a lot of that stuff anymore.

704
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:15,153
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

705
00:48:15,194 --> 00:48:19,290
Scott: Is that now with console gaming and PC gaming that quote just works.

706
00:48:19,811 --> 00:48:25,990
Scott: There is a lot less things to motivate kids, you know, who are gamers to learn how computers.

707
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:27,618
Rym: I'm not saying it's a bad thing.

708
00:48:27,698 --> 00:48:29,306
Rym: I do not want to go back to those days.

709
00:48:29,366 --> 00:48:32,982
Rym: those days sucked But no, but as a kid think about it.

710
00:48:33,042 --> 00:48:33,745
Rym: I was just a kid.

711
00:48:33,825 --> 00:48:41,269
Rym: I wanted to play quake After about a week of learning all this stuff to try to figure out why my rockets came out two seconds after I fired.

712
00:48:41,289 --> 00:48:49,696
Rym: I Was like doing trace routes to count how many hops it was to servers and I decided to only play on servers that were less Than three hops from my house.

713
00:48:50,399 --> 00:48:55,480
Rym: and like I compiled this list of like good servers I posted to my local forums and got like communities together.

714
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:58,570
Rym: I learned all I learned so much networking.

715
00:48:58,610 --> 00:49:01,105
Rym: It was crazy and it mattered a lot more.

716
00:49:01,185 --> 00:49:08,050
Rym: back then like nowadays Like I can play NS with like a ping between 70 and about 200 with no serious issue.

717
00:49:08,592 --> 00:49:12,590
Rym: Back then like the ping just killed you like you couldn't even play.

718
00:49:13,792 --> 00:49:17,010
Scott: Yeah, cuz think about it, right if the ping is milliseconds, right?

719
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:24,110
Scott: Which is one thousandth of a second, right and you don't think that's that's very long at all But it's actually forever in computing time, right?

720
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:32,986
Scott: So if you're paying is 200 milliseconds, that means that you know Let's see one fifth of every second right is basically lost.

721
00:49:33,006 --> 00:49:36,657
Scott: you're playing at a delay So you see someone else move.

722
00:49:36,998 --> 00:49:40,950
Scott: they're actually like way behind where you thought, you know or ahead of where you thought they were.

723
00:49:41,131 --> 00:49:44,490
Rym: You know, they're not where you see them because now it's a delay and it gets even worse.

724
00:49:44,490 --> 00:49:44,891
Rym: I mean thing.

725
00:49:44,992 --> 00:49:50,050
Scott: and if it's like if it's a slow paced game like a turn like chess that doesn't mean anything.

726
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:54,070
Scott: It just means you their move will show up, you know, not noticeably later.

727
00:49:54,150 --> 00:50:00,010
Scott: But if it's a real-time game, like if it's a shooting game It's a fast game really fast.

728
00:50:00,231 --> 00:50:05,770
Rym: So a slight delay makes a big big difference and I mean old games didn't handle it very gracefully.

729
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:08,462
Rym: I mean think about all the how complicated would be to handle it gracefully.

730
00:50:08,482 --> 00:50:10,290
Rym: ten different people on the server.

731
00:50:10,693 --> 00:50:12,490
Rym: They all have different ping times.

732
00:50:12,831 --> 00:50:15,382
Rym: Do you just make the server like where does it?

733
00:50:15,563 --> 00:50:16,829
Rym: where does this computer show me?

734
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:26,130
Rym: Where you are if my ping is 180 and your pings 400 because you're reacting to things Later than I'm reacting to the same events?

735
00:50:26,753 --> 00:50:37,397
Scott: Yeah, if I shoot into the middle of nowhere on my screen I shot into the middle of nowhere, but maybe by the time that bullet information gets to the server Someone else is standing there now.

736
00:50:37,779 --> 00:50:38,963
Scott: So does it kill them?

737
00:50:39,223 --> 00:50:41,190
Scott: or because on my screen no one was there?

738
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:42,810
Scott: Does it not kill them nowadays?

739
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:50,928
Rym: Are very good at being predictive and just kind of handling that well I mean back in the day like in quake 1 and quake 2 and all those games and even RTS.

740
00:50:50,968 --> 00:50:52,233
Rym: is You like?

741
00:50:52,635 --> 00:50:56,170
Rym: it was weird how sometimes people would be mad at the high ping bastards.

742
00:50:56,551 --> 00:50:58,338
Rym: You know, oh you high ping bastards.

743
00:50:58,618 --> 00:51:00,043
Rym: You always disappear around corners.

744
00:51:00,104 --> 00:51:05,808
Rym: You're all jaggy because some netcode Basically gave high pingers kind of an advantage in a boy also.

745
00:51:06,011 --> 00:51:14,830
Scott: Well, they would complain about high ping bastards because if you had a 56 game modem and someone else had a cable modem They were playing the game on basically almost no delay for the server.

746
00:51:14,971 --> 00:51:16,649
Scott: So it was a smooth experience for them.

747
00:51:17,011 --> 00:51:22,330
Scott: Thus it was pretty easy for them to actually play effectively and you were playing a shaky jaggy game.

748
00:51:22,732 --> 00:51:25,750
Scott: So a high ping bastard was like damn you the game is actually working for you.

749
00:51:25,831 --> 00:51:26,679
Scott: I can't play for shit.

750
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:29,520
Scott: It's all jaggy Alright, but a low ping bastard.

751
00:51:29,641 --> 00:51:34,260
Scott: you see if you had the low ping Sometimes it was an advantage because even though the game sucked for you.

752
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,905
Rym: Well, you always wanted the low ping.

753
00:51:35,925 --> 00:51:38,135
Scott: I Mean, yeah.

754
00:51:38,336 --> 00:51:40,789
Rym: Yeah, but some games give an advantage to my pig.

755
00:51:41,531 --> 00:51:47,203
Scott: right if you had the high ping then everything was all shaky and jaggy and You couldn't.

756
00:51:47,223 --> 00:51:47,589
Scott: you know?

757
00:51:47,831 --> 00:51:48,735
Scott: It's so you could play.

758
00:51:48,795 --> 00:51:53,374
Rym: you could pull tricks in some games like getting around people because they just couldn't shoot you you were jumping On the screen so much.

759
00:51:53,996 --> 00:51:57,169
Scott: Yeah, but in like Halo, I know that people like my cable modem.

760
00:51:57,189 --> 00:51:58,416
Scott: now This is the first game modem.

761
00:51:58,436 --> 00:51:59,603
Scott: I've had that actually has this.

762
00:51:59,945 --> 00:52:00,730
Scott: there's a button on it.

763
00:52:00,770 --> 00:52:01,575
Scott: It's the hold button.

764
00:52:01,615 --> 00:52:03,749
Scott: It basically turns off the internet when you hold the button down.

765
00:52:04,171 --> 00:52:21,990
Scott: I don't know who decided to put those buttons on cable modems, but they're there and Apparently there are people who would like put their foot on this button Right next to their TV playing halo on the Xbox and they would tap the button to sort of lag themselves out a little bit When they were gonna die and it would mean that they wouldn't get hit.

766
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:26,567
Scott: It was like this they could cheat with it, you know by adjust by basically turning off the internet for a second.

767
00:52:26,808 --> 00:52:34,881
Rym: Awesome I used to shoot like that at the realm because if I was about to die in combat before they fix that I would totally just pull my network cable out.

768
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:39,050
Scott: Oh And it logged you out instead of dying.

769
00:52:39,271 --> 00:52:40,500
Rym: Yeah, good because I didn't want to.

770
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:41,910
Scott: you know, I'm even in the middle of a fight.

771
00:52:42,271 --> 00:52:44,961
Rym: Do you know how much fucking experience you lost.

772
00:52:45,041 --> 00:52:49,169
Rym: if you died and if you lost an item well shit That's 80 hours of your life gone.

773
00:52:50,491 --> 00:52:52,138
Scott: Why did you waste 80 hours of your life?

774
00:52:52,198 --> 00:52:53,062
Rym: I was stupid.

775
00:52:53,102 --> 00:52:54,508
Rym: that was back when I played MMOs.

776
00:52:54,609 --> 00:52:59,857
Rym: a lot Mmo a lot the only em of the first MMO.

777
00:52:59,878 --> 00:53:02,204
Scott: Well the first 3d mmm.

778
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:05,935
Rym: Nope the first graphical MMO It was 3d.

779
00:53:06,196 --> 00:53:13,641
Rym: Nah kinda kinda anyway All right, yeah, so so where were you going with this?

780
00:53:13,661 --> 00:53:15,609
Rym: cuz you're mixing mixing up high ping and low ping quite a bit.

781
00:53:16,272 --> 00:53:22,270
Scott: I was low paying is the guys who were the playing is nice and high ping is the guys where everything is slow and she.

782
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:32,730
Scott: Sometimes you hate the low guys because they're they're getting good games and sometimes they hate the high guys because Their game is all shaky and it's making it hard to hit them and they're basically cheating.

783
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:39,558
Rym: Well nowadays, I really not only do I only hate the high guys just cuz I don't want to deal with them But I've been spoiled my whole life.

784
00:53:39,638 --> 00:54:01,310
Rym: I mean even in the quake one days once I learned network stuff I played on bunnies server, which was 26 ping 26 about and that's pretty good for you know, the quake one era on a cable modem And then I got to RIT Where I would have single digit pings to a lot of those servers on campus.

785
00:54:01,351 --> 00:54:09,490
Scott: Well, first of all We were playing in a lot of servers that were on the RIT campus and second of all Even when we played on servers that weren't on the RIT campus, we had an OC 3 connection.

786
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:13,524
Scott: Basically, the ping was never above 10. if the ping was above 10.

787
00:54:13,524 --> 00:54:14,648
Scott: I wouldn't play on that server.

788
00:54:14,789 --> 00:54:16,539
Rym: Yeah But it's weird.

789
00:54:16,579 --> 00:54:34,045
Rym: I got so spoiled by that That I actually have a little bit of trouble now playing a game like NS outside of RIT because my ping will be like 50 or 60 and I don't know if it's just psychological but I can kind of feel it like Like I'll play and I like I'll keep missing like what the fuck's going on.

790
00:54:34,065 --> 00:54:39,480
Rym: and I look at the ping is like WTF but there's not enough NS servers.

791
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,369
Rym: I look at that's like the best ping and server from here.

792
00:54:42,052 --> 00:54:44,002
Scott: You know, I mean that's the thing is in beacon.

793
00:54:44,142 --> 00:54:48,106
Scott: the pings were actually, you know I've when I first got to beacon with the cable modem.

794
00:54:48,146 --> 00:54:53,224
Scott: I was sort of like This isn't good, but actually beacon the internet we have there.

795
00:54:53,284 --> 00:54:54,710
Scott: The cable vision is pretty good.

796
00:54:54,810 --> 00:54:56,377
Scott: The the pings are not too high.

797
00:54:56,417 --> 00:55:00,654
Scott: you can play on NS servers like a ping of 30 ping of 40 You know, you can.

798
00:55:00,674 --> 00:55:02,180
Scott: you can get a good game on over there.

799
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:03,223
Scott: It's not RIT.

800
00:55:03,384 --> 00:55:07,350
Scott: It's not college, but it's good Here with the Time Warner.

801
00:55:07,872 --> 00:55:13,232
Scott: I mean I had I was having some problems and I tried to play Left 4 Dead 2 and I was like what the hell Is this.

802
00:55:13,332 --> 00:55:14,497
Scott: but I solved those problems.

803
00:55:14,517 --> 00:55:18,897
Scott: They were not what I thought they were but regardless of that I mean I have it working now.

804
00:55:19,078 --> 00:55:24,650
Scott: It's not unplayable like it was when I had the problems But the pings are still ludicrously high.

805
00:55:24,991 --> 00:55:32,462
Scott: I mean, I'm surprised that Left 4 Dead 2 is so playable with like a ping of a hundred something It's actually it works Like I'm not noticing.

806
00:55:32,502 --> 00:55:43,370
Scott: the ping is too high but it is too high and I can't really get a lower one without like running the server myself or something like that because I Think it's really bad on this internet connection to this day.

807
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:46,018
Rym: I mean we were at RIT and it was just like that.

808
00:55:46,098 --> 00:55:56,470
Rym: the infrastructure and the internet is so important to my life like the internet is Possibly the most important like utility in my life after electricity because I can buy water.

809
00:55:57,915 --> 00:56:02,190
Rym: You can't shower and water you can buy it off I can put it in a tank buy bottles of it.

810
00:56:03,872 --> 00:56:08,402
Rym: But like the internet is just like the kind of life I lead without the internet I'd lead a completely different life.

811
00:56:09,269 --> 00:56:15,630
Rym: and Yet the internet at RIT was so many orders of magnitude more reliable and faster and stronger.

812
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:16,775
Scott: It's even faster now.

813
00:56:16,835 --> 00:56:17,820
Scott: who knows what they've done to it.

814
00:56:18,001 --> 00:56:18,784
Rym: Oh my god.

815
00:56:18,804 --> 00:56:20,070
Rym: I just can't even imagine.

816
00:56:20,391 --> 00:56:22,096
Scott: Maybe they've got three OC3s.

817
00:56:22,498 --> 00:56:22,799
Rym: Daddy.

818
00:56:22,819 --> 00:56:23,742
Scott: They got an OC48.

819
00:56:24,243 --> 00:56:25,808
Rym: Maybe they daddy to OC3.

820
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:28,241
Scott: Well, yeah, RIT to OC3.

821
00:56:28,261 --> 00:56:33,770
Rym: Yeah Well, we had that one on internet to where half the game servers were too, which was even better.

822
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:35,070
Rym: That was like our private internet.

823
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:41,210
Scott: It was nothing but pirated software and games and it automatically routed you over internet to whenever possible.

824
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:44,154
Scott: You didn't even have to know about it or do anything So it just worked.

825
00:56:44,716 --> 00:56:52,850
Rym: but it's so hard to leave that environment and this is why I still feel that Someday, we would we could be able to make like a geeky apartment complex.

826
00:56:53,151 --> 00:56:59,290
Rym: We're like everyone together gets an OC3 and it's basically only nerds live there who care about nerdy things.

827
00:56:59,653 --> 00:57:06,910
Rym: And it's somehow we can get an internet to also If we make it an educational institution of some kind and pay whatever we got to pay.

828
00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:08,294
Scott: That's fine by me.

829
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:13,330
Rym: I'd be willing to give up internet - I just want a ping of one like I used to have.

830
00:57:13,874 --> 00:57:16,030
Scott: I want a ping of negative one like I used to have.

831
00:57:18,090 --> 00:57:28,090
Scott: Basically it was really a ping of zero because I would you know The server was right next to me on a stupid fast network But it was so fast that that the old FPS is didn't know what to do.

832
00:57:28,230 --> 00:57:30,461
Scott: So they calculated is negative one then.

833
00:57:30,481 --> 00:57:36,643
Rym: I mean it's such a different world though Like like my work now my non gaming life my working day job life, right?

834
00:57:37,305 --> 00:57:52,071
Rym: We worry about latency to the point that calculating the speed of Electrons based on the physical distance between data centers We use that as a benchmark for the lowest like cutting your ethernet cable shorter and like it's the minimum length just to you Know.

835
00:57:52,492 --> 00:57:55,725
Rym: basically we use that measure as a kind of objective measure of.

836
00:57:55,785 --> 00:58:04,490
Rym: this is the floor of latency We can get between these two sites and then we get real close to that latency that we measure based on the speed of electrons.

837
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:09,689
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know, it's it's actually latency is not just.

838
00:58:09,749 --> 00:58:11,790
Scott: you know I don't want to get techie on the game day.

839
00:58:11,951 --> 00:58:17,040
Scott: But you know, it's an issue for a lot of things like Synchronizing clocks and synchronize, you know, it's.

840
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:32,738
Scott: and the thing is right is a lot of people nowadays they're coming with internet connections like like on your phone and you know the for the you know, the F dues on your laptop like the little cards and things and Those internet connections on your phone and such.

841
00:58:32,778 --> 00:58:37,834
Scott: they have a lot of bandwidth, but the latency on those is horrible Absolutely the worst.

842
00:58:38,055 --> 00:58:44,338
Scott: if you try to play like counter-strike on with your cell phone Your ping is gonna be like a thousand.

843
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:50,978
Scott: so people are tell you know acting like the future is gonna be all this wireless Internet but really that wireless internet.

844
00:58:51,118 --> 00:59:04,250
Scott: even if the bandwidth goes way up and we get the coverage and we fix a lot of the Problems of the congestion and all that the pings are still so high that a lot of internet Applications are just not going to work with that kind of latency.

845
00:59:04,370 --> 00:59:07,530
Scott: You can't play games with that kind of latency no matter what the bandwidth is.

846
00:59:07,912 --> 00:59:10,270
Scott: You can't synchronize clocks with that kind of latency.

847
00:59:10,314 --> 00:59:11,513
Rym: No Well, actually you can.

848
00:59:11,554 --> 00:59:17,175
Rym: synchronizing clocks even with high latency is really easy so long as the latency is symmetric Asymmetric.

849
00:59:17,295 --> 00:59:19,349
Scott: as the thing is the latency is constantly changing.

850
00:59:20,092 --> 00:59:25,969
Rym: It can change as much as it wants as long as it's symmetric for given sets of routes on average then it works.

851
00:59:26,876 --> 00:59:29,293
Scott: See like the way the phones do it I think is they just keep

852
00:59:29,755 --> 00:59:30,417
Rym: updating you

853
00:59:30,598 --> 00:59:37,250
Scott: and like the clock isn't actually synchronizing with a proper NTP It's just sort of updating the time on it, you know to the minute

854
00:59:37,310 --> 00:59:40,605
Rym: Actually, I've been looking more and more into PTP the precision time protocol.

855
00:59:41,609 --> 00:59:53,343
Scott: Oh Very interesting anyway, but yeah gaming wise it's sort of like we're moving to this future of netbooks with you know Build connecting to the cell phone network, you know, Google Chrome OS, whatever.

856
00:59:53,363 --> 00:59:55,770
Scott: This is really really gonna hurt gaming.

857
00:59:55,790 --> 00:59:59,630
Rym: Well, it's only going to hurt real-time gaming where reactions matter.

858
00:59:59,732 --> 01:00:00,890
Rym: I mean, that's true.

859
01:00:01,171 --> 01:00:02,980
Rym: a lot of gaming does not require that.

860
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:04,346
Rym: sieve for does not require that.

861
01:00:04,688 --> 01:00:07,982
Rym: even a lot of RTS's don't require that because you don't need to.

862
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:09,950
Rym: the game reacts slower than you're clicking.

863
01:00:10,452 --> 01:00:16,050
Rym: All the clicking is is the command interface, but the game itself is following those commands on the server.

864
01:00:16,151 --> 01:00:19,889
Rym: So even if you have high latency all that means that you're reacting more slowly.

865
01:00:20,414 --> 01:00:29,896
Rym: but if you don't have to worry so much about Like who can see what and when the server just handles that and also predictive stuff is really really made this a lot less of an issue than it used to be.

866
01:00:29,916 --> 01:00:37,148
Scott: yeah, but if you look at like You know even Wi-Fi just regular old Wi-Fi adds a significant amount to your ping.

867
01:00:37,248 --> 01:00:43,610
Scott: and you know People are like getting their Xboxes and Wiis, you know, they don't have internet near wired internet near the TV most people.

868
01:00:43,650 --> 01:00:50,740
Scott: So they're getting those on the Wi-Fi and latency not so good, you know when you do that I mean, it's playable, but it's it's not great.

869
01:00:51,041 --> 01:00:53,150
Rym: Yep, but the netcode is kind of covered it.

870
01:00:53,210 --> 01:00:58,110
Rym: But I think we're getting to the point to where netcode will not be able to cover it up any further than it already has.

871
01:00:58,210 --> 01:01:02,010
Rym: I mean we've gotten to the point where for a lot of games a hundred ping is manageable.

872
01:01:02,110 --> 01:01:06,004
Rym: I mean back in the quake one days hundred ping was on fucking playable.

873
01:01:06,325 --> 01:01:07,850
Rym: You just might as well not even bother.

874
01:01:09,531 --> 01:01:14,570
Scott: It's also gotten to the point where people are just like, you know games are just automatically matching you up.

875
01:01:14,650 --> 01:01:24,350
Scott: They're not even letting you showing you the list of servers or the fact that there is even a ping at all You know, which is somewhat annoying to me because like I want to see and pick the low ping server.

876
01:01:24,832 --> 01:01:30,319
Scott: But on the other hand, I think it's you know, if you just hide it from most people They're not gonna know the difference.

877
01:01:30,843 --> 01:01:31,770
Rym: Yeah, it's tricky.

878
01:01:31,810 --> 01:01:43,470
Rym: I mean I still feel that having like the dedicated servers there and you look at the list of servers is a better way to foster a Long-term community, but at the same time a lot of the people playing don't want community and that would just confuse them.

879
01:01:44,351 --> 01:01:47,870
Scott: Yeah, I think I think it what it needs to be is an option like in Left 4 Dead 2.

880
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:50,522
Scott: It's not an option, but they should have it there.

881
01:01:50,582 --> 01:01:52,350
Scott: Just put it in a hidden menu for the cool people

882
01:01:52,591 --> 01:02:04,446
Rym: Yeah, but even I mean I guess my advice to all you punk kids is learn a little bit about networking in the very least learn how to trace route and Count how many hops and figure out how to turn on the net graphs in like half-life so you can see.

883
01:02:04,507 --> 01:02:09,485
Rym: I mean if you're Getting choppy gameplay a lot of people will say or complain like I did back in the day.

884
01:02:09,826 --> 01:02:10,990
Rym: Why is my game so choppy?

885
01:02:11,170 --> 01:02:12,108
Rym: I got a great video card.

886
01:02:12,814 --> 01:02:15,550
Rym: Check your ping check your packet loss check all that stuff.

887
01:02:15,610 --> 01:02:20,210
Scott: You might know if the game is not choppy and single-player and it is choppy and multiplayer.

888
01:02:20,336 --> 01:02:25,387
Rym: Well Well most likely you might have a weird bug, but it might be.
