00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,605
Rym: Hey, it's Wednesday, November 4th.

2
00:00:11,967 --> 00:00:21,086
Rym: I'm Rym Scott over Skype and this is GeekNights tonight a rambling review of giant robo the animation.

3
00:00:25,866 --> 00:00:26,614
Rym: Let's do this.

4
00:00:30,883 --> 00:00:32,149
Rym: Well, it's Wednesday.

5
00:00:32,168 --> 00:00:37,268
Scott: Oh Man I just I need it to be Friday.

6
00:00:37,388 --> 00:00:39,335
Scott: Oh, no, I don't we're going to a convention.

7
00:00:39,435 --> 00:00:39,836
Rym: Are we?

8
00:00:39,876 --> 00:00:40,799
Rym: that's gonna be fun, though?

9
00:00:41,503 --> 00:00:44,040
Scott: Yeah, but it's like I. really it's a bad timing.

10
00:00:46,542 --> 00:00:49,700
Rym: What do you possibly have to do that needs that weekend?

11
00:00:50,242 --> 00:00:55,800
Scott: I still don't even have any freaking curtains or rugs or couch or I got so much shit going on.

12
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:56,858
Rym: I thought you ordered a couch.

13
00:00:57,722 --> 00:00:59,679
Scott: Yeah, it's not waiting for it to show up.

14
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,459
Scott: I got you know, maybe it could have been delivered on Saturday, but no now it can't be delivered Saturday.

15
00:01:06,881 --> 00:01:10,353
Rym: Are you least gonna be free by the time anime Boston comes around and PAX East?

16
00:01:10,854 --> 00:01:12,460
Scott: Yeah, I think I'll be okay by that.

17
00:01:13,585 --> 00:01:16,799
Scott: I just need you know, like a couple months to you know get sorted in.

18
00:01:16,839 --> 00:01:25,500
Scott: such I still have boxes on the floor, but only a few of actually Surprisingly unpacked a great deal of things because I'm working on all our anime Boston stuff.

19
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,260
Rym: That's the one kind we haven't planned a lot yet because it kind of just works out.

20
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,904
Rym: Yeah That's.

21
00:01:31,944 --> 00:01:34,775
Scott: uh, I don't even I haven't been thinking about conventions at all.

22
00:01:34,835 --> 00:01:36,260
Rym: This is why I'm here to handle all this.

23
00:01:36,461 --> 00:01:39,800
Rym: I'm already putting in all our stuff for every con that'll take stuff.

24
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:42,934
Scott: I have been working on the website though.

25
00:01:42,954 --> 00:01:44,000
Scott: I made a big progress.

26
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:57,855
Scott: So it like I think what I my strategy now is pretty much, you know, I've been I've been so perfectionist, I mean, you know not absolute perfectionist, but it's like I Twiddle and twiddle and tool till it's just right and I put it out there.

27
00:01:58,358 --> 00:02:03,866
Scott: for now I think what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make a few improvements and as soon as I get you know I basically need like one or two more.

28
00:02:03,886 --> 00:02:08,607
Scott: then I'm gonna put it out there and then I'm gonna make you know I'm gonna follow the release.

29
00:02:08,747 --> 00:02:11,160
Scott: early release often cult of done.

30
00:02:11,481 --> 00:02:15,614
Rym: Well, I was about to say at work right one of my guys who developed stuff like he's.

31
00:02:15,734 --> 00:02:17,700
Rym: he was complaining about not getting stuff done.

32
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,887
Scott: I'm not because releasing is a feature, you know.

33
00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:20,670
Scott: Yes.

34
00:02:20,971 --> 00:02:21,994
Rym: That's exactly what I said.

35
00:02:22,215 --> 00:02:23,640
Rym: He's like he's having all these problems.

36
00:02:23,741 --> 00:02:24,205
Rym: I looked at him.

37
00:02:24,266 --> 00:02:32,920
Rym: I was like, you know Getting the product out is in and of itself a feature and he looks at me and he's like that's really wise.

38
00:02:34,004 --> 00:02:35,460
Rym: And then he was like all inspired.

39
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:38,660
Scott: Yes, we stole all our wisdom from the Internet.

40
00:02:39,462 --> 00:02:42,800
Rym: I see a lot of my wisdom from the Greeks to Greeks and the Internet.

41
00:02:43,402 --> 00:02:55,329
Scott: You know what that where I live is a very Greek neighborhood and actually if you get off my subway station There's one of those parks there, you know, it's typical New York Park with the playground and you know Wall ball and some benches and that's all man.

42
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:56,393
Rym: I want to play some wall ball.

43
00:02:56,895 --> 00:02:58,240
Scott: Yeah, but you know what it is.

44
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:04,478
Scott: it's actually it's Athens Park and there's a zoo statue and there's an Aristotle statue and there's some pillars.

45
00:03:04,839 --> 00:03:09,100
Rym: and What kinds of pillars, you know, like Parthenon kinds?

46
00:03:10,383 --> 00:03:14,956
Scott: and then there's a. there's a. this is like a plaque on the zoo statue.

47
00:03:14,996 --> 00:03:20,800
Scott: that's sort of like, you know, Donated by like, you know president of Greece or whatever or something like that.

48
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,740
Scott: So it's like oh it is very cool to go hang out in the Athens Park.

49
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:29,669
Rym: you know what you should do because it's the kind of prank I like is Make a little tiny fake plaque.

50
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:30,995
Rym: You just kind of sit on top of it.

51
00:03:31,015 --> 00:03:32,120
Rym: That just says look you mighty.

52
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:36,973
Scott: The thing is it's everything's in good condition there so it doesn't.

53
00:03:37,415 --> 00:03:38,319
Rym: so let's look you might lose.

54
00:03:38,924 --> 00:03:40,880
Scott: The pillars are actually in perfect condition.

55
00:03:41,001 --> 00:03:41,805
Scott: But the thing is there.

56
00:03:41,986 --> 00:03:44,440
Scott: it's sort of like these three pillars of the thing on top and that's it.

57
00:03:44,621 --> 00:03:48,980
Scott: It's sort of it's sort of made to look like a ruin, you know, so I guess you could put look you mighty on that.

58
00:03:50,881 --> 00:03:52,285
Scott: Yeah, that's pretty cool.

59
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:53,048
Scott: It's cool park.

60
00:03:53,349 --> 00:04:02,499
Rym: Anyway, I talked about anime news, you know, we try to do that but The anime news now we're like nothing happens anymore at all.

61
00:04:03,342 --> 00:04:06,369
Scott: Well, cuz there's no the only news you can really get right.

62
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:10,760
Scott: you realize most news sites even like Kotaku or a joystick or or?

63
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,655
Scott: Anything all they really do is regurgitate press releases.

64
00:04:13,775 --> 00:04:19,113
Scott: Yeah And they're not doing business or a lot of business.

65
00:04:19,415 --> 00:04:21,019
Scott: there aren't a lot of press releases.

66
00:04:22,806 --> 00:04:34,500
Rym: The secondary news about conventions and things like that, but even the conventions, you know We're kind of we're a convention season has been done for a while And now that I'm working we're working more with like Otakon and all these other cons and staff.

67
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,340
Rym: I'm learning that more and more these cons don't do anything until not that long before the cons happen.

68
00:04:41,062 --> 00:04:42,245
Rym: So we're like between.

69
00:04:42,646 --> 00:04:48,380
Rym: the only time where there's news is when all the secondary like meta news about anime cons and stuff happens.

70
00:04:49,121 --> 00:04:50,746
Scott: Network is like now.

71
00:04:50,806 --> 00:04:52,892
Scott: it's not really the anime news network anymore.

72
00:04:53,033 --> 00:04:53,574
Scott: Instead.

73
00:04:53,755 --> 00:04:54,678
Scott: It's really like.

74
00:04:54,938 --> 00:04:58,208
Scott: it's the you know news about.

75
00:04:58,408 --> 00:05:04,479
Scott: you know, it's just generic stuff that happens to people who may be associated with anime.

76
00:05:04,982 --> 00:05:08,800
Scott: It is like someone who wrote a manga got sick to me.

77
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,620
Rym: It's the anime news Nina site that happens to have news on it and a nice encyclopedia.

78
00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:14,236
Scott: You know this.

79
00:05:14,318 --> 00:05:15,757
Scott: yeah I think definitely they need to.

80
00:05:16,241 --> 00:05:22,177
Scott: They need to start pushing their like columns out into the front more because that's really most of their content now.

81
00:05:22,898 --> 00:05:25,914
Scott: and you know I guess we could talk about anime news network for a whole bunch.

82
00:05:26,015 --> 00:05:28,490
Scott: But yeah, it's Anime news anymore.

83
00:05:28,571 --> 00:05:29,779
Scott: So you got to do something else.

84
00:05:30,302 --> 00:05:34,420
Rym: Yep, but there is a tiny bit of news, but I actually didn't find it on the anime news network.

85
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,377
Rym: I found it on the Scott news network.

86
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,767
Rym: You know, we join the Otakon staff.

87
00:05:40,787 --> 00:05:46,085
Rym: we would join the panels department and they have as far as I can tell they haven't really Done anything yet.

88
00:05:46,105 --> 00:05:49,959
Rym: like Otakon is not gearing up to do anything yet until the new year starts.

89
00:05:50,742 --> 00:05:53,774
Rym: Meanwhile the comic-con the San Diego comic-con.

90
00:05:53,814 --> 00:05:59,519
Rym: that happens like comic-con Maybe a month before Otakon actually less than a month before Otakon.

91
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:03,512
Rym: this time I think their preview night badges are already sold out.

92
00:06:03,573 --> 00:06:10,118
Rym: the four days plus the special day and The regular four day membership badge is almost sold out already.

93
00:06:11,502 --> 00:06:15,480
Rym: The con isn't until the end of July and it's basically sold out.

94
00:06:16,623 --> 00:06:17,996
Scott: They're already on the move.

95
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:25,700
Scott: meanwhile This one convention is one four and a half four day one night X, you know four day five night event.

96
00:06:26,442 --> 00:06:28,249
Scott: It's basically a year-round job.

97
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:31,460
Rym: Meanwhile, I email, you know, our staff contacts know to count.

98
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:38,020
Rym: I'm like we want to get these people to do a cool like lecture at Otakon and they're like email us back in January.

99
00:06:38,983 --> 00:06:39,628
Scott: Yeah, good job.

100
00:06:39,668 --> 00:06:40,333
Rym: I'm like great.

101
00:06:40,393 --> 00:06:45,993
Scott: Thanks Like Otakon is always talking, you know, we were volunteer run.

102
00:06:46,034 --> 00:06:47,920
Scott: we work so hard we don't get paid.

103
00:06:47,980 --> 00:07:00,435
Scott: Well, look, you're not really, you know, you know say all you want, you know I I put up so I can I don't have to shut up and you know what you guys do not work hard enough Not as hard as people work at other conventions.

104
00:07:00,495 --> 00:07:05,015
Scott: paid or unpaid Enforcers work harder and better than the Otakon staffers.

105
00:07:05,055 --> 00:07:06,179
Scott: a step the fuck up.

106
00:07:06,866 --> 00:07:07,372
Rym: I hate to.

107
00:07:07,696 --> 00:07:08,784
Rym: you know Do that?

108
00:07:08,844 --> 00:07:11,740
Rym: I hate to wrang on Otakon because I do like Otakon and I do enjoy it.

109
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,583
Rym: Oh, it's great.

110
00:07:12,704 --> 00:07:15,294
Scott: But I'm just saying it's like you need to step up the game.

111
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:16,620
Scott: That's you know the game.

112
00:07:16,661 --> 00:07:26,892
Scott: They've been playing the same game They've been playing for years and everyone else is getting ahead of them and you know doing a better job then and they're doing the same Job, they did five years ago, which is still a damn good job.

113
00:07:26,912 --> 00:07:29,240
Scott: It's just the competition is getting fierce.

114
00:07:30,842 --> 00:07:36,042
Scott: It's what I used to go to Otakon and you go to some other con and it was clear Otakon was just a million times better.

115
00:07:36,102 --> 00:07:43,504
Scott: but now other cons are getting better than Otakon and Otakon is staying at the same level of quality and Relatively speaking.

116
00:07:43,624 --> 00:07:46,293
Scott: It doesn't you know measure up someone like case in point.

117
00:07:46,314 --> 00:07:47,477
Rym: Look at anime Boston.

118
00:07:47,558 --> 00:07:48,904
Rym: anime, Boston Like it.

119
00:07:48,924 --> 00:07:51,820
Rym: just it grew so suddenly that I had all these problems.

120
00:07:51,981 --> 00:07:53,967
Scott: But they keep stepping up their game.

121
00:07:54,127 --> 00:07:58,040
Rym: the last anime Boston I'd say was equivalent to Otakon and everything but scale.

122
00:07:58,763 --> 00:08:05,558
Rym: Yep, in fact as a from the meta perspective it was better because anime Boston It's a lot of stuff for us.

123
00:08:06,442 --> 00:08:07,826
Scott: Yeah, they paid us money.

124
00:08:07,967 --> 00:08:09,592
Rym: Yeah, they covered our expenses.

125
00:08:10,013 --> 00:08:12,060
Rym: Otakon's like yeah, there's a badge.

126
00:08:12,887 --> 00:08:19,700
Rym: Yeah, all right, but We've gone on that rant like yes, but there is one convention beyond the San Diego comic-con.

127
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,910
Rym: That's already got us act together.

128
00:08:20,931 --> 00:08:22,020
Rym: So I got I got a point out.

129
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:28,040
Rym: Connecticut is already accepting panel submissions because we're the heads of panels and look at us.

130
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:32,520
Rym: We've already gotten some panel submissions a decent number in fact, and we're already working on stuff.

131
00:08:32,681 --> 00:08:44,559
Rym: so if you want to present at Connecticut follow the link and send us a panel submission and you'll get an email back and we'll probably be able to give you a scheduled time a lot sooner than you'd expect.

132
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:54,377
Scott: So I don't really have a news because you know There isn't one but I will continue my sort of tradition of doing like geek bites on Wednesday.

133
00:08:54,478 --> 00:08:56,966
Scott: as long as you know There's no anime manga news.

134
00:08:57,126 --> 00:09:05,120
Scott: So I actually I don't have a new thing to talk about though I could probably think of one if I had to but I want to walk in Tetsuwan birdie.

135
00:09:06,021 --> 00:09:08,029
Scott: Yeah, I do want to talk about though.

136
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,398
Scott: 20th century boys volume 5, right?

137
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:15,451
Scott: So I'm reading 20th century boys, of course and volume 5.

138
00:09:15,451 --> 00:09:31,380
Scott: I got it yesterday, right and I read it last night and you know, I never thought that I would like have a negative thing to say about a Salva book but really like just like it's such a fucking tease.

139
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:37,975
Scott: It's like dude you cannot just keep dragging it out like this.

140
00:09:38,015 --> 00:09:38,978
Scott: you have to.

141
00:09:39,099 --> 00:09:56,340
Scott: you know Spill the beans at some point, you know, it just doesn't work, you know, and I mean there's a. you know You talk to these, you know, if you're gonna talk about suspense, it's like sure you got to lead people along but you can't like just never have The moment and just keep skipping over it forever.

142
00:09:56,521 --> 00:09:59,055
Scott: there has to be a point at which you let it go.

143
00:09:59,156 --> 00:10:03,759
Scott: and if you're it's like you know in comedy even if your joke is perfect if the timing is off it doesn't work.

144
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:09,900
Scott: and In 20th century boys volume 5 he messes up the timing of the suspense release.

145
00:10:10,121 --> 00:10:12,552
Scott: He should have released and he just didn't.

146
00:10:12,592 --> 00:10:13,958
Scott: he just keeps holding on to it.

147
00:10:15,524 --> 00:10:20,140
Scott: You know, it's like it just sort of falls on the floor, but it rather than being released.

148
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,974
Scott: So you still don't know what it is, but now you're just like I'll fuck it.

149
00:10:23,014 --> 00:10:24,180
Scott: I don't give a shit anymore.

150
00:10:25,341 --> 00:10:26,284
Scott: I mean imagine this.

151
00:10:26,304 --> 00:10:26,765
Scott: imagine.

152
00:10:26,805 --> 00:10:29,052
Scott: here's the perfect example right here.

153
00:10:29,072 --> 00:10:30,897
Scott: This is the best analogy I can think of.

154
00:10:31,037 --> 00:10:36,846
Scott: Okay, so you're watching You're watching The Empire Strikes Back.

155
00:10:37,006 --> 00:10:37,548
Rym: All right.

156
00:10:37,568 --> 00:10:49,036
Scott: Okay, and you're watching it and you're watching it and You know Luke is talking to Yoda and he's like I gotta go help them, you know, and Yoda is like you shouldn't go help them right.

157
00:10:49,116 --> 00:10:59,486
Scott: and then it stops and It cuts to the beginning of the return of the Jedi and he's like, you know Luke is like knocking on Jabba the Hutt's door.

158
00:11:00,168 --> 00:11:01,331
Scott: That is what this is.

159
00:11:01,412 --> 00:11:10,583
Scott: And then they start teasing you like, you know, oh You know, they don't actually tell you what happened at the end of Empire Strikes Back But they sorta.

160
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:12,308
Scott: you could you start to infer it.

161
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:15,920
Scott: but he purposefully keeps hints very very small.

162
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,686
Scott: So it's like, you know, so it like you see.

163
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:23,245
Rym: so you see Luke and he's got like a black arm and you don't know why exactly.

164
00:11:23,326 --> 00:11:25,643
Scott: that is right and They're gonna.

165
00:11:25,663 --> 00:11:29,919
Scott: basically it's like this multi imagine like a whole series of movies, right?

166
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:45,300
Scott: But they take the climaxes off the end of them the the revealing awesome epic climax moments chop them all off and stick them all at the very very ends you have to watch like 10 movies and Then you get like a climb.

167
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,300
Scott: However, I don't even know if there's a climax at the end because I haven't gotten to the end.

168
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:49,862
Scott: You know what?

169
00:11:49,882 --> 00:11:52,430
Rym: This is possibly do when you read the last volume.

170
00:11:52,871 --> 00:11:54,677
Rym: It's basically going to be 200 pages of orgasm.

171
00:11:57,163 --> 00:11:57,768
Scott: It's no good.

172
00:11:57,809 --> 00:12:05,940
Scott: You've got to give it to me You that point in the middle right the scene with the with the speech and the gun and the whole thing, right?

173
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,027
Scott: yeah, 20th century boys needs that.

174
00:12:08,108 --> 00:12:12,645
Scott: it needs that scene in the middle of the series and It didn't.

175
00:12:12,827 --> 00:12:14,600
Scott: I didn't get the scene in the middle of the series.

176
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,666
Scott: He's just like fuck you.

177
00:12:15,806 --> 00:12:18,260
Scott: This is where you should have put that scene right here and he didn't do it.

178
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:38,159
Rym: You know, it's very interesting cuz it's kind of Wagnerian because if you watch like got her dammer on or any of those Wagner operas the kind of music he uses like it it grows and builds intention like the chords like But they'll never like resolve into the chord that finalizes it.

179
00:12:38,641 --> 00:12:46,156
Rym: The cadence just kind of keeps building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building and building forever And you don't get any release for like four hours.

180
00:12:46,196 --> 00:12:48,793
Scott: then you fall asleep You know, you're sitting there.

181
00:12:48,813 --> 00:12:50,744
Scott: You're like build build build Where's the release?

182
00:12:50,825 --> 00:12:53,460
Scott: and then eventually you're not getting a release long enough and you're just like, huh?

183
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:57,113
Scott: Whatever and I'm all whatever now with 20th century boys.

184
00:12:57,153 --> 00:13:01,909
Scott: So volume six is not have That scene that I need then.

185
00:13:01,929 --> 00:13:02,792
Scott: I don't know.

186
00:13:02,853 --> 00:13:04,700
Scott: I'll probably still buy the whole damn thing.

187
00:13:04,903 --> 00:13:19,040
Scott: You Know I definitely already that that fact It's like Pluto is just like, you know I I was like having a hard time determining like Pluto or 20th century boys.

188
00:13:19,361 --> 00:13:21,368
Scott: But now it's Pluto by like a landslide.

189
00:13:21,408 --> 00:13:32,810
Rym: see it's way it's hard for me to say because Pluto is satisfying My deep-rooted desire for more ghost in the shell a little bit which kind of gives it this Artificial boost in my liking of it.

190
00:13:33,151 --> 00:13:33,733
Rym: That's true.

191
00:13:33,954 --> 00:13:34,436
Rym: And it's it's.

192
00:13:34,637 --> 00:13:35,520
Rym: it's not good in a way.

193
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:39,779
Rym: It's kind of like that penny arcade where he's like, well, there's no substitute for the original tribes, too.

194
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:45,432
Rym: But I can prescribe some of this and some of this Like onslaught or whatever.

195
00:13:45,472 --> 00:13:45,856
Rym: that was.

196
00:13:47,142 --> 00:13:47,924
Scott: What is that thing?

197
00:13:47,944 --> 00:13:51,252
Rym: that the instant action doesn't matter was a poor simulacrum?

198
00:13:51,893 --> 00:13:54,419
Rym: Yeah, it's like methadone to my heroin addiction.

199
00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:04,120
Rym: But It is interesting you bring that up because giant robo which we're gonna talk about the other half of the show Kinda, it does that same thing.

200
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:11,350
Rym: It'll keep like leading you on to something like blah blah blah blah blah the trash Eventually, but they keep.

201
00:14:11,471 --> 00:14:17,740
Scott: I've watched two The first disc of giant robo, which is the first two, I guess I'll call them movies because they're pretty long.

202
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,972
Scott: Yeah, the first episodes.

203
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:26,299
Rym: and they tell you shit But at the same time they keep hint it like there's a lot that's left unsaid.

204
00:14:26,319 --> 00:14:35,928
Scott: oh But I mean 20th century boys basically says nothing Nothing At least giant robo will.

205
00:14:36,249 --> 00:14:42,639
Rym: it doesn't actually say as much as you think but every time you think wait What about suddenly there's a giant robot and you forget about all that?

206
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:48,820
Rym: Yeah, like you get all these you get all these like other kinds of releases then you forget that wait a minute.

207
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,940
Rym: What the fuck is Vogler up to anyway?

208
00:14:51,842 --> 00:14:54,095
Scott: I'll save my giant robo talk for the other part of the show.

209
00:14:54,115 --> 00:14:54,336
Rym: Yeah.

210
00:14:54,437 --> 00:15:03,489
Rym: Yeah So things of the day.

211
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:06,520
Rym: I bring to you something very very sad.

212
00:15:06,601 --> 00:15:12,637
Rym: There's no video or anything But it's an end of an era and this reminded me of so much of my childhood.

213
00:15:12,657 --> 00:15:23,878
Rym: you kids today You have like Red Bull and amp and rock star and balls And Bronco and power thirst and like you have energy drinks and you don't even think about it.

214
00:15:23,898 --> 00:15:24,700
Rym: They're just there.

215
00:15:25,343 --> 00:15:29,500
Rym: When we were kids in the 80s and 90s there weren't energy drinks.

216
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:29,963
Rym: There was.

217
00:15:29,983 --> 00:15:42,240
Scott: yeah, I mean it was like this coveted thing Like we knew that out there somewhere like I didn't drink them, of course, but other kids, you know There was like this these mythical like drinks like Joel Joel and kicks.

218
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,263
Rym: They're the only two.

219
00:15:43,564 --> 00:15:45,269
Rym: surge wasn't an energy drink.

220
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,776
Rym: surge was just a like Mountain Dew.

221
00:15:47,836 --> 00:15:49,040
Rym: that kind of tasted weird.

222
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:54,120
Scott: Yeah, anyway, there was like these mythical drinks that like you couldn't just get at any grocery store.

223
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,007
Scott: You could only get them in certain special.

224
00:15:56,047 --> 00:15:56,951
Rym: Yeah, you know where I get.

225
00:15:57,071 --> 00:15:59,279
Rym: they had like they had like 2x caffeine.

226
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:06,687
Rym: There was the Michigan equivalent of a bodega and there's one bodega head kick and we used to buy it like Secretly.

227
00:16:06,727 --> 00:16:07,819
Rym: our parents wouldn't let us drink it.

228
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,580
Rym: I mean kids weren't allowed to drink coffee back then and most of us didn't even like coffee and there was nothing else.

229
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:18,340
Rym: So we'd all drink Mountain Dew and like it hopped up on caffeine from Mountain Dew and the piddly amount of caffeine in it.

230
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,323
Scott: And isn't it weird?

231
00:16:19,484 --> 00:16:21,913
Scott: like kids back then you weren't allowed to drink an energy drink.

232
00:16:21,993 --> 00:16:26,076
Scott: now kids could drink over energy drinks They want but they can't walk down the street at night.

233
00:16:26,217 --> 00:16:35,186
Rym: Yeah but Jolt Cola was like this big deal whenever anyone got some like if someone got a case of jolt We'd have a party with it.

234
00:16:35,206 --> 00:16:37,719
Rym: We'd stay up all night playing video games drinking jolt.

235
00:16:38,641 --> 00:16:41,556
Scott: Yeah, it was like holy if someone had like a bottle of jolt in school.

236
00:16:41,616 --> 00:16:49,140
Scott: It was like, holy shit They might even get in trouble even at RIT when we were there like Red Bull's like 10 jolts Red Bull back.

237
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:53,434
Rym: That was still not that commonly available and like Red Bull didn't even exist.

238
00:16:53,514 --> 00:17:00,295
Rym: the closest thing to an energy energy drink We had was like that dragon berry like sobe stuff with the taurine in it.

239
00:17:00,315 --> 00:17:01,720
Scott: Yeah, I didn't drink that.

240
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,688
Rym: I drank that but this is an end of an era.

241
00:17:04,909 --> 00:17:08,680
Rym: and I didn't realize that Jolt Cola was based out of Pittsburgh by RIT.

242
00:17:10,001 --> 00:17:12,287
Rym: Interesting, they filed chapter 11 bankruptcy.

243
00:17:12,426 --> 00:17:14,090
Rym: They're like five million dollars and dead.

244
00:17:14,132 --> 00:17:17,319
Scott: It's all over, you know, there's no reason that had to happen.

245
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:23,520
Scott: They could have easily Remarketed themselves with all the energy drinks and you know the fact that people remembered the name Jolt.

246
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,042
Scott: What are they?

247
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:26,880
Rym: could you know, they would have been very very careful.

248
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:33,362
Rym: They would have had to market it basically to people born between 1981 and 1989.

249
00:17:33,362 --> 00:17:41,519
Scott: I think also that you know if they I don't know what it tastes like But I'm sure that if they could have worked on the flavor a lot and they could have you know Yeah, Joel tasted like fucking ass.

250
00:17:41,983 --> 00:17:43,215
Rym: Oh my god.

251
00:17:44,142 --> 00:17:49,620
Scott: To make an energy drink that tasted good and that I think really because the energy drinks they don't taste good.

252
00:17:49,941 --> 00:17:52,858
Rym: I mean, yeah, the Red Bull is great and balls is awesome.

253
00:17:53,923 --> 00:17:54,665
Scott: I'm sure they can.

254
00:17:54,685 --> 00:17:58,620
Rym: power service has all new flavors like chocolate and gun.

255
00:18:01,001 --> 00:18:05,293
Rym: But I just I want to point out it's just the disparity of the ages.

256
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:10,240
Rym: Jolt's catchphrase was quote twice the caffeine.

257
00:18:11,042 --> 00:18:14,579
Scott: Yeah, nowadays it's like caffeine free lots of other shit though.

258
00:18:15,062 --> 00:18:16,229
Rym: Well, I mean kind of like.

259
00:18:16,249 --> 00:18:18,100
Rym: there was this peak and then it kind of leveled out.

260
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,163
Rym: I mean there's like Red Bull.

261
00:18:19,524 --> 00:18:26,487
Rym: and then it all ramped up to calf or cocaine and then everyone tried cocaine and was like wow This is just poison.

262
00:18:26,527 --> 00:18:31,729
Rym: and then they ramped it back down to Red Bull and nothing really went beyond Red Bull All right.

263
00:18:31,769 --> 00:18:37,637
Scott: So You know how if you read like the old comic books from like the 50s and the 60s I hit you.

264
00:18:37,677 --> 00:18:41,320
Scott: you little guy Know a little bit before that era, right?

265
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:49,301
Scott: There were always those ones that like, you know, like tales to astonish or strange tales or tales of suspense or stuff like that You know

266
00:18:49,863 --> 00:18:51,068
Rym: and they usually

267
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:57,617
Scott: they a lot of them would involve like some monster, you know They'd always make up a monster and the monster would be in that one comic book.

268
00:18:57,657 --> 00:19:02,420
Scott: and that was it Right, and so here's a blog the monster blog, right?

269
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:06,178
Scott: Which is a tribute to the monster comics of Jack Kirby.

270
00:19:06,198 --> 00:19:11,512
Scott: and Basically, this tells you about all the different monsters of that category.

271
00:19:11,572 --> 00:19:18,449
Scott: So there's the imaginary monsters alien conquerors Aliens disguised as humans atomic freaks.

272
00:19:19,051 --> 00:19:34,099
Scott: atomic freaks slash possible deviant mutates Mutate yeah benevolent aliens dragon creatures freaks of nature freaks of nature that are possible deviant mutates Hoaxes humans that are you know in disguise or something like that?

273
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:57,073
Scott: human mutants lab experiment gone wild miscellaneous mythological creatures sea monsters sentient plant life strange places subterranean creatures supernatural beings technology gone wild transformed humans and unusual objects, so Just to give you you know examples of what we're talking about here.

274
00:19:57,094 --> 00:20:00,946
Scott: We're talking about monsters like Dragoon the flaming invader.

275
00:20:01,046 --> 00:20:01,668
Scott: Yeah.

276
00:20:02,029 --> 00:20:02,551
Rym: Yeah.

277
00:20:02,571 --> 00:20:03,513
Scott: Okay, goo.

278
00:20:03,553 --> 00:20:04,175
Scott: Damn.

279
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:22,057
Scott: like father like son Mumba the wicked wooden statue or Rambu his very name made mankind tremble, you know, I think we need an anime that is like that Sprag the living hill.

280
00:20:23,282 --> 00:20:23,824
Rym: What's it do?

281
00:20:24,005 --> 00:20:25,471
Rym: feed people who walk on it?

282
00:20:25,793 --> 00:20:29,907
Rym: It's not so much a hill can do Sprag conquer of the human race.

283
00:20:29,948 --> 00:20:30,810
Scott: Here's the planet.

284
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:32,054
Scott: Let's see original appearance.

Scott: Wow, he's actually also appeared in sensational she-hulk 31.

287
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:48,940
Rym: Yeah, it's a giant hill that is alive with the sound of murder, I don't know.

288
00:20:50,781 --> 00:21:01,588
Scott: Let's see in Something fear the villagers watched is from the great yawning chasm there emerged the most fantastic Most incredible sight ever seen by mortal man.

289
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,796
Scott: Look for the love of heaven.

290
00:21:03,836 --> 00:21:04,719
Scott: That thing is is alive.

291
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,624
Scott: it's Throbbing breathing.

292
00:21:10,065 --> 00:21:11,649
Scott: keep back don't go near it.

293
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:15,840
Rym: I somehow imagine all of these monsters looking vaguely like the claw.

294
00:21:16,761 --> 00:21:20,071
Rym: No, they actually as big as a flying battleship.

295
00:21:20,251 --> 00:21:21,274
Rym: it's a flying battleship.

296
00:21:21,294 --> 00:21:23,140
Rym: Jack Kirby monsters lying battleship.

297
00:21:23,903 --> 00:21:32,257
Scott: You know, the thing is like, you know, I'm not the biggest Jack Kirby fan in the universe But I mean this style of monster is totally freakin sweet.

298
00:21:32,619 --> 00:21:43,066
Rym: Yeah It's the kind of thing that you either have to do so unironically That you just have to go with it kind of like giant robo or a read or die Or you have to just completely make fun of it.

299
00:21:43,547 --> 00:21:46,817
Rym: if you fall anywhere between those two extremes you're done.

300
00:21:46,837 --> 00:21:52,292
Scott: Yeah Yeah, here's a blog about all about those monsters and not much else.

301
00:21:52,613 --> 00:21:53,636
Scott: So check it out.

302
00:21:53,877 --> 00:21:54,740
Rym: Sounds like a pretty good blog.

303
00:21:55,344 --> 00:21:56,393
Rym: It's a good blood.

304
00:21:56,413 --> 00:21:59,651
Rym: So the meta Musil minute here.

305
00:21:59,671 --> 00:22:01,463
Scott: Ah Very good.

Scott: We remembered.

307
00:22:02,128 --> 00:22:03,639
Rym: Okay, I can't panel submit them.

308
00:22:05,723 --> 00:22:07,560
Rym: Zen kai khan this weekend.

309
00:22:08,403 --> 00:22:10,220
Scott: King of Prussia, Pennsylvania.

310
00:22:10,581 --> 00:22:12,790
Rym: Yep, November 6th, or is it?

311
00:22:12,871 --> 00:22:15,240
Rym: does it start on Friday or just Saturday Saturday and Sunday?

312
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,847
Rym: Yes, so November 7th and 8th, not 6th.

313
00:22:18,047 --> 00:22:19,952
Rym: There's nothing going on on Friday.

314
00:22:20,193 --> 00:22:21,777
Rym: We're not even getting into town until late.

315
00:22:22,439 --> 00:22:36,240
Scott: Yes Also the book club Selection is the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy by Douglas Adam Douglas Only the first one not any of the restaurants or salmon or anything.

316
00:22:36,502 --> 00:22:38,319
Rym: I got to think about what to pick for my book.

317
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,449
Scott: Yeah, are you gonna use the same criteria?

318
00:22:41,529 --> 00:22:49,767
Rym: I did or I'm thinking the monster at the end of the book We got to get these kids to read.

319
00:22:49,787 --> 00:22:55,566
Scott: I mean maybe if we did like a whole collection of kids books, you know Maybe hop on pop like the hats.

320
00:22:56,248 --> 00:22:57,713
Scott: Yeah, we did like 10 or 20 of them.

321
00:22:58,074 --> 00:23:01,198
Scott: Yeah, I don't know Any other.

322
00:23:02,402 --> 00:23:06,514
Rym: Yes, we're still using Skype and GeekNights is all kind of fast and loose.

323
00:23:06,555 --> 00:23:08,240
Rym: And so we situate all our.

324
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:09,909
Scott: It's a little bit better.

325
00:23:10,292 --> 00:23:10,494
Rym: Yep.

326
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:11,139
Rym: It's a little bit better.

327
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:26,276
Rym: eventually, we'll do the dual recording and record ahead and all that and I got to figure out what I'm doing with buying a House or whatever because the dude I was gonna buy this house from apparently skip town and didn't pay the property Taxes and the bank like doesn't know what to do and the house is abandoned.

328
00:23:26,296 --> 00:23:27,120
Rym: They cut off the gas.

329
00:23:27,786 --> 00:23:32,392
Scott: I went over to the house and it's like Maybe they could demolish the house and you could just buy the land.

330
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:33,035
Rym: No, dude.

331
00:23:33,155 --> 00:23:33,838
Rym: So here's the thing.

332
00:23:33,918 --> 00:23:34,500
Rym: land, right?

333
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,170
Rym: You know mountain beacon.

334
00:23:36,311 --> 00:23:41,276
Rym: and out to the left of it There's this gigantic two-acre lot with like a driveway going through it and nothing in it.

335
00:23:41,939 --> 00:23:45,000
Rym: Yep That's for sale for like a hundred and forty thousand dollars.

336
00:23:45,961 --> 00:23:46,503
Scott: Just buy it.

337
00:23:46,644 --> 00:23:50,140
Rym: I'm thinking about just buying it and just like put a shack on it.

338
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:57,827
Rym: No I'll just buy it and then like live with Emily and pay rent there or something for like a year until I pay off the You know measly hundred and forty thousand dollar mortgage.

339
00:23:58,328 --> 00:24:02,580
Rym: and then I own two acres of like prime land next to the mountain with light.

340
00:24:02,681 --> 00:24:11,067
Scott: You know what you could do is right you get you buy it Right, and then what you do is you build like a little house like, you know, just you know something That's not very big buying a building.

341
00:24:11,107 --> 00:24:15,182
Rym: A little house is not substantially cheaper than building a big house Really?

342
00:24:15,343 --> 00:24:21,080
Scott: I mean not even like a house almost like like an in-law thing like a garage a kitchen a living room.

343
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:33,715
Rym: No, I was looking you realize for for like 300 grand I can build like a five-bedroom three-bathroom like Monster house with a gallery and a balcony.

344
00:24:33,735 --> 00:24:36,067
Scott: Yeah, I'm talking about like $50,000.

345
00:24:36,067 --> 00:24:41,899
Rym: build like a little time Scotty would cost me more than $50,000 to get the architect and the contractor and the sewer connections.

346
00:24:44,703 --> 00:24:45,005
Rym: Yeah,

347
00:24:45,045 --> 00:24:55,986
Scott: I was like if you could just get like, you know, basically an apartment there Right, then you basically just live in it and then eventually build a big old house like it like a half a million dollar house And then

348
00:24:56,006 --> 00:25:02,486
Rym: you have this little apartment Basically cost the same no matter how big the house I build is within a certain scale.

349
00:25:02,586 --> 00:25:07,064
Rym: and as my grandpa said because my grandpa built his own party house a long time Little old for that.

350
00:25:07,084 --> 00:25:19,637
Rym: now He turned 80 recently Yeah, but yeah You know, he could at least talk and tell you what what he basically told me a long time ago was.

351
00:25:19,737 --> 00:25:22,286
Rym: if you're building your Own house build a mansion.

352
00:25:22,306 --> 00:25:29,875
Rym: There's no reason not to and all I can picture now is courage wolf saying that to me There's no reason not to.

353
00:25:33,325 --> 00:25:33,748
Rym: So we'll see.

354
00:25:33,789 --> 00:25:34,837
Rym: I'm sorting all that shit out.

355
00:25:34,877 --> 00:25:43,380
Rym: however If I don't do that I'm thinking about renting space either in the city or in Beacon like commercial space just to have a studio.

356
00:25:45,241 --> 00:25:46,630
Rym: I got all this money to like.

357
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:53,819
Rym: if I don't buy this house right now I've got money to do something with like a lot of those I know some places in the city that would be good for that.

358
00:25:54,041 --> 00:26:01,873
Rym: I'm also seriously trying to find out what it would cost to license the translation and distribution and whatever rights to sanctuary.

359
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:06,170
Scott: Oh Really you want to get the public really seriously.

360
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:10,252
Rym: if I fits like if I can get it for like under 80 grand or so I'm just doing it.

361
00:26:10,616 --> 00:26:12,124
Rym: Jesus Really.

362
00:26:12,184 --> 00:26:14,000
Rym: Wow think about think about sanctuary.

363
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,210
Rym: right?

364
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:21,366
Rym: If you took that did a treatment of it to get like a screenplay and tried to sell that as like a 24 style TV show In America, I don't know if we get.

365
00:26:21,828 --> 00:26:23,255
Scott: I don't know how much rights we get.

366
00:26:23,275 --> 00:26:24,100
Scott: you'd have to get you know.

367
00:26:24,281 --> 00:26:27,040
Rym: Well, yeah, that's why I'm sorting all that out and that's taking a lot of my time.

368
00:26:27,261 --> 00:26:32,219
Scott: Like even if we bought the rights would be allowed to just put it out online for free like we'd want to.

369
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:32,600
Scott: you know.

370
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,143
Scott: Would we be?

371
00:26:33,163 --> 00:26:35,800
Scott: you know, how much you'd be allowed to do would be able to just?

372
00:26:37,141 --> 00:26:39,511
Rym: That's exactly what I have to figure out.

373
00:26:39,551 --> 00:26:43,529
Rym: I have to find the rights and figure it all out And that's that's what I'm spending my time on right now.

374
00:26:44,373 --> 00:26:45,096
Rym: I'll be sweet.

375
00:26:45,277 --> 00:26:49,060
Rym: Oh my god If nothing else I could just be like yeah sanctuary by Rym.

376
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:51,812
Scott: Yeah, I don't think you can do that.

377
00:26:51,993 --> 00:26:53,200
Rym: It depends on what rights I get.

378
00:26:58,402 --> 00:27:03,300
Scott: The rights to that sort of thing never leave the creator, you know only the only the copy rights.

379
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:05,586
Rym: We can see what I can do.

380
00:27:06,369 --> 00:27:06,569
Rym: Yeah.

381
00:27:06,669 --> 00:27:15,346
Rym: Anyway anyway, so giant robo Giant robo watch the whole thing.

382
00:27:15,386 --> 00:27:17,875
Scott: I've only watched it's weird cuz it's all it's like.

383
00:27:17,935 --> 00:27:18,076
Scott: it's.

384
00:27:18,276 --> 00:27:19,300
Scott: it's an OAV, right?

385
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,547
Scott: It's only a few episodes.

386
00:27:20,568 --> 00:27:21,433
Scott: How many episodes is it?

387
00:27:21,694 --> 00:27:26,692
Scott: Ah eight, I believe Alright, so I've watched disc one which had two episodes, but they were long.

388
00:27:26,733 --> 00:27:27,234
Scott: I think it's like.

389
00:27:27,295 --> 00:27:31,644
Scott: it's like movies almost, you know TV miniseries, it's.

390
00:27:31,865 --> 00:27:35,600
Scott: it feels like it's a TV miniseries where each episode is like one of those one-hour deals.

391
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,042
Rym: Well, it's got.

392
00:27:36,082 --> 00:27:44,640
Scott: it was a high production value OAV with like seven episodes Yeah, and the other thing is the thing is that second episode though?

393
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:50,620
Scott: Like the first half of it was like recap of the first episode, you know, yeah, which is like really it's an OAV.

394
00:27:50,861 --> 00:27:51,927
Scott: Why are you recapping?

395
00:27:52,169 --> 00:27:53,175
Rym: Well, there's a part of.

396
00:27:53,195 --> 00:27:53,920
Rym: there's a reason for that.

397
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,259
Rym: Let me tell you all the story of giant robo before we talk about what it's about.

398
00:27:57,941 --> 00:28:08,626
Rym: Giant robo was originally a manga and a terrible live-action TV show from the late 60s Called giant robo.

399
00:28:09,027 --> 00:28:12,135
Rym: that has almost nothing to do with giant robo.

400
00:28:12,155 --> 00:28:12,797
Rym: the animation.

401
00:28:12,817 --> 00:28:14,803
Rym: Ah It's weird.

402
00:28:14,883 --> 00:28:17,091
Rym: I can't even there's so much to say about that.

403
00:28:17,171 --> 00:28:37,669
Rym: I was watching clips of it on YouTube and good God Suffice the generic old crappy robot show that happens to have this robot in it Kinda but it was by a guy named Mitsuteru Yokoyama and this is from like late 60s early 70s, so The anime giant robo.

404
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:41,220
Rym: the animation was directed by Yoshihiro Imagawa.

405
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,708
Rym: You know G Gundam Imagawa.

406
00:28:43,749 --> 00:28:44,411
Scott: I think it's isn't it?

407
00:28:44,451 --> 00:28:45,595
Scott: Yasuhiro Imagawa.

408
00:28:45,615 --> 00:28:46,598
Rym: Yasuhiro Imagawa.

409
00:28:46,618 --> 00:28:47,100
Rym: What did I say?

410
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:47,564
Scott: I don't know.

411
00:28:47,645 --> 00:28:51,432
Rym: I gotta look it up But he is the G Gundam guy.

412
00:28:51,452 --> 00:28:58,036
Scott: Oh The G Gundam guy really that explains, you know, it's not really like G Gundam that much at all.

413
00:28:58,077 --> 00:29:06,580
Rym: So, yeah But he's the G Gundam guy and I think he wrote like the script for berserk And a couple other weird random shows.

414
00:29:08,461 --> 00:29:12,840
Scott: hmm Anyway, yeah, so yeah, he's Yasuhiro Imagawa.

415
00:29:13,028 --> 00:29:13,154
Scott: Yep.

416
00:29:13,701 --> 00:29:29,100
Rym: So basically what happened was the producer of such great works as Urochika Doji and ninja resurrection Went to Imagawa and was like I want you to make an anime based on giant robo.

417
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:34,977
Rym: And Imagawa was like I'm totally a fan of Yokoyama because you know Tetsujin 28 was awesome.

418
00:29:36,303 --> 00:29:38,012
Rym: So I'm gonna make it.

419
00:29:38,173 --> 00:29:39,239
Rym: I'm gonna go all for it.

420
00:29:39,642 --> 00:29:51,642
Rym: But as they got all the deal together They basically discovered that they only had the rights to giant robo and not to any other character from the giant robo manga or TV show Really?

421
00:29:51,782 --> 00:29:52,845
Rym: So what they did?

422
00:29:52,926 --> 00:29:53,929
Scott: so they were originally.

423
00:29:53,969 --> 00:29:54,390
Scott: we're going.

424
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:57,640
Scott: we're going to just do a remake of the original giant robo.

425
00:29:57,801 --> 00:29:59,579
Rym: I'm not a hundred percent sure on that.

426
00:30:00,001 --> 00:30:16,273
Rym: All I know is that because they did not have the rights to any character, but giant robo They basically took all these random characters from all of Yokoyama's other works and use them as characters in giant robo.

427
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,138
Rym: Okay, so also notice how the opener to giant robo has all those robots that are not in the show.

428
00:30:23,198 --> 00:30:24,663
Rym: and I'm gonna tell you They're not in the show.

429
00:30:24,683 --> 00:30:25,786
Rym: There are.

430
00:30:25,886 --> 00:30:27,511
Scott: it's a Nintendo horse situation.

431
00:30:27,531 --> 00:30:30,340
Rym: There aren't even that many giant robots in the show.

432
00:30:30,943 --> 00:30:34,280
Scott: Yeah, I've only seen like two so far besides giant robo himself.

433
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,651
Rym: Yeah, there are also very few actual giant robot fights.

434
00:30:37,791 --> 00:30:39,958
Rym: And in fact, I'd say there are more people versus.

435
00:30:39,979 --> 00:30:40,400
Rym: they're incorrect.

436
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,709
Scott: They're really reminiscent of big O fights.

437
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:45,179
Scott: Well or big O is reminiscent of giant robo.

438
00:30:45,219 --> 00:30:47,625
Rym: Yeah Well, there's more to the story.

439
00:30:47,706 --> 00:30:52,661
Rym: so giant robo was begun and first released in 1992.

440
00:30:52,661 --> 00:30:54,689
Rym: The last episode was not released until 1998.

441
00:30:54,689 --> 00:31:00,960
Scott: Oh It's one of those big long OAVs where they take forever to come out with the next.

442
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,532
Rym: Yeah, and they made a bunch of episodes.

443
00:31:02,572 --> 00:31:03,600
Rym: then there was a long delay.

444
00:31:03,741 --> 00:31:07,278
Rym: then they made the gin race special and then they came back and made the end.

445
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:22,560
Rym: and apparently in the interim between like the last and the second last episode and all during that period a Bunch of the staff who were working on giant robo Worked on other stuff and a lot of the same people did big O. that did giant robo.

446
00:31:23,641 --> 00:31:24,886
Scott: Wasn't big O made later?

447
00:31:24,906 --> 00:31:34,320
Rym: Yeah, but like the people went on to work on big O And they worked out a bunch of other weird projects like in the interim when giant robo was working on and not working on.

448
00:31:36,741 --> 00:31:42,500
Scott: Very interesting, so there's always there is a gigantic list of like animators on the anime news network.

449
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:43,362
Rym: Yes, there's this.

450
00:31:43,543 --> 00:31:47,493
Rym: so there's this gigantic crazy story of how giant robo happened.

451
00:31:47,914 --> 00:31:57,020
Rym: and there's a manga that was made in like 2007 and there was like a remake TV anime that I don't know anyone who's seen from the same time.

452
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,606
Rym: and There's all this stuff around giant robo.

453
00:31:59,686 --> 00:32:05,240
Scott: and yeah, there's something on here about giant robo 40th anniversary here on the anime news network.

454
00:32:05,541 --> 00:32:07,108
Scott: So it says it came out in 2007 13 episodes.

455
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,112
Scott: Oh, yeah, so here's the thing.

456
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:13,793
Rym: So people worked on giant robo also worked on get a robo Armageddon.

457
00:32:13,813 --> 00:32:19,407
Rym: All right, so Basically, I'm gonna have to skip all that.

458
00:32:19,467 --> 00:32:27,003
Rym: We're just talking about giant robo the animation the 90s Oav7 episodes.

459
00:32:27,263 --> 00:32:30,873
Rym: we're not talking about any other part of it because other than a couple of YouTube clips.

460
00:32:31,695 --> 00:32:33,560
Rym: I know nothing about it.

461
00:32:34,382 --> 00:32:41,006
Scott: Yeah, and we're really only talking about the first two episodes because that's all I've seen so far and we'll talk about it again After I've seen.

462
00:32:41,046 --> 00:32:42,816
Rym: this is not a final thoughts.

463
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:43,540
Rym: This is a review.

464
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:49,964
Rym: We were reviewing giant robo because I think you should all watch giant robo and I'm trying to convince you to watch Giant robo.

465
00:32:50,365 --> 00:32:54,380
Rym: if you want the history of it or you know, attention 28 and how that led to this.

466
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,043
Rym: I'll bow up.

467
00:32:55,686 --> 00:33:02,400
Rym: I guess you should go to anime world order because as Daryl Surratt points out commonly We are nothing but rank amateurs in the face of his majesty.

468
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:08,420
Scott: Perhaps, you know, the thing is is like we watched giant robo for the first time.

469
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:11,933
Scott: We watched the first episode of it anyway, and the RIT anime closed way back.

470
00:33:11,953 --> 00:33:13,700
Rym: And we walked out before it even ended.

471
00:33:14,441 --> 00:33:16,610
Scott: Yeah, well, no, I think we finished that first episode.

472
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:18,116
Rym: No, we walked out and played some games.

473
00:33:18,176 --> 00:33:21,328
Scott: I'm pretty sure I Remember watching the whole first episode.

474
00:33:21,388 --> 00:33:23,840
Rym: I think I walked out and played Carcassonne or something.

475
00:33:23,961 --> 00:33:24,689
Rym: You stayed till the end.

476
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:25,539
Rym: then you met with us later.

477
00:33:26,481 --> 00:33:30,680
Scott: Anyway, you know and back then, you know, we weren't particularly thrilled with it.

478
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,680
Scott: We didn't feel a strong need to see any more of it and we didn't see any more.

479
00:33:35,748 --> 00:33:43,415
Rym: It was so weird how I Watch it now and I'm really surprised I didn't catch on to or like the show as much as I didn't back then.

480
00:33:43,857 --> 00:33:46,228
Rym: back then I was like, yeah Whatever some stupid robot show.

481
00:33:46,248 --> 00:33:47,996
Rym: Why does everyone have superpowers?

482
00:33:48,036 --> 00:33:48,719
Rym: This is dumb.

483
00:33:50,122 --> 00:33:54,269
Scott: Well, you know, I don't think it's dumb now Like I guess I did then but I don't.

484
00:33:54,349 --> 00:33:57,220
Scott: I'm not it's still not as like thrilled with it as you are.

485
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,404
Rym: I love this show.

486
00:33:58,625 --> 00:34:06,012
Rym: This is this is becoming like every time I watch parts of it again It becomes one of my favorite anime like it's rising in the list.

487
00:34:06,052 --> 00:34:08,119
Rym: It's in like my top 25 favorite anime.

488
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:10,326
Scott: now Yeah, this is not my.

489
00:34:10,386 --> 00:34:12,391
Scott: what am I top 25 favorite anime?

490
00:34:12,512 --> 00:34:14,217
Scott: I mean, it's alright, but it's not like.

491
00:34:14,237 --> 00:34:16,844
Scott: oh, yeah It's just it's okay.

492
00:34:16,886 --> 00:34:21,139
Scott: It's you know, it's it's got some parts to it that I can appreciate but it's not like.

493
00:34:21,621 --> 00:34:24,540
Scott: Incredibly thrilling and amazing and epic and whatever.

494
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:31,620
Rym: It's difficult to describe the plot of giant Robo because it it's a show that begins in media res and ends in media res.

495
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:42,849
Rym: it was actually described by a lot of the people working on it as it was intended to be the penultimate battle between the good and evil in this world Not the ultimate battle.

496
00:34:42,889 --> 00:34:44,540
Rym: It is basically the penultimate that battle.

497
00:34:45,022 --> 00:34:53,920
Rym: It starts at the beginning of like the conflict before the final conflict But they never intended to show you the final conflict.

498
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:54,641
Rym: They did.

499
00:34:54,723 --> 00:34:59,660
Rym: actually there's all this stuff where they release like the names of the follow-on series.

500
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:08,340
Rym: There's supposed to be like a prequel and then like a three-day like the end and end that were never made And I don't know if they were even actually intended to be made.

501
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:20,180
Rym: it was kind of like Star Wars where Star Wars starts in the middle of this gigantic Galactic Civil War and Ends kind of after one like big climax, but doesn't resolve the overarching story.

502
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:23,420
Rym: It's like one tiny piece of this ongoing intergalactic story.

503
00:35:24,601 --> 00:35:26,210
Rym: Giant Robo is kind of the exact same thing.

504
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:28,200
Rym: It starts with this crazy

505
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,323
Scott: retrain

506
00:35:29,483 --> 00:35:47,220
Rym: like battle where there's a guy with a briefcase and he's on a train and he's trying to get away from this other guy with a giant robot and then bad guys appear and good guys appear and they're all superheroes and it's just this beautifully animated gigantic running fight scene through this new futurist world.

507
00:35:48,024 --> 00:35:50,154
Scott: Yeah, the animation is pretty good.

508
00:35:50,174 --> 00:35:54,692
Scott: You know the music I mean, I guess the sound is good, but I mean the music.

509
00:35:54,732 --> 00:35:56,860
Scott: I couldn't even like recognize the song from it.

510
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:02,953
Rym: It's not like memorable music Straight up like classical style custom soundtrack.

511
00:36:03,415 --> 00:36:05,583
Scott: I don't even like notice it at all Are you kidding?

512
00:36:05,603 --> 00:36:09,059
Rym: The music is like the best part of giant Robo other than the cell animation.

513
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:10,463
Scott: No, it's it.

514
00:36:10,884 --> 00:36:12,873
Scott: good music is like the kind of music like you.

515
00:36:12,913 --> 00:36:14,580
Scott: remember it and you recognize it.

516
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,348
Scott: I couldn't you know, it's just it's.

517
00:36:16,529 --> 00:36:17,433
Scott: it's serviceable.

518
00:36:17,553 --> 00:36:18,919
Scott: It's you know, I don't notice it.

519
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,560
Scott: You know, I'm sure it, you know works at the mood, but it's not music.

520
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:28,030
Scott: I could if you played for me a song from the giant Robo soundtrack I couldn't tell you that it was some giant robo really like.

521
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:32,843
Rym: really that's very surprising to me because to me the soundtrack is Amazing.

522
00:36:33,185 --> 00:36:36,195
Rym: It's very I don't want to necessarily say operatic.

523
00:36:36,215 --> 00:36:37,720
Rym: But have you ever actually seen an opera?

524
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,704
Rym: Yeah, what opera?

525
00:36:40,527 --> 00:36:41,470
Scott: I saw?

526
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:46,362
Scott: Romeo and Juliet at the Met and I saw Something else.

527
00:36:46,402 --> 00:36:46,984
Scott: I forget

528
00:36:47,265 --> 00:36:59,120
Rym: because one common thing in a lot of opera especially later opera is the like the leitmotif There's like the theme or the melody of a different character and giant Robo has his own very specific leitmotif

529
00:36:59,603 --> 00:36:59,804
Scott: And the

530
00:36:59,864 --> 00:37:04,587
Rym: music is very like almost Too big for the show.

531
00:37:04,647 --> 00:37:11,380
Rym: like the show can barely contain the music and it really to me sets up this Almost too epic to be believed premise.

532
00:37:11,725 --> 00:37:23,875
Rym: it's it's kind of Gurren Lagann esque in that the music is bigger than the show could possibly be and you're forced to either think the show is stupid or Ignore the soundtrack or just take it at face value.

533
00:37:23,895 --> 00:37:25,020
Rym: and this is the most epic thing ever.

534
00:37:27,444 --> 00:37:28,221
Scott: hmm, I Don't know.

535
00:37:28,241 --> 00:37:28,884
Scott: It's to me.

536
00:37:28,924 --> 00:37:30,170
Scott: You know, I mean it's like I don't.

537
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:34,286
Scott: there's no like, you know, like memorable Melodies or anything like that.

538
00:37:34,307 --> 00:37:35,614
Scott: It doesn't stand out.

539
00:37:35,714 --> 00:37:36,096
Scott: It's just.

540
00:37:36,116 --> 00:37:42,640
Rym: you know, there's Not that that giant robo theme that they play every time giant robo is about to do something.

541
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,510
Scott: No, like I couldn't if you played it for me.

542
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:48,610
Scott: I like, you know, if you played three things for me I couldn't tell you which one it was.

543
00:37:48,631 --> 00:37:48,691
Scott: Wow.

544
00:37:48,832 --> 00:37:52,780
Rym: I That really amazes me like it really does surprise me.

545
00:37:53,601 --> 00:37:56,751
Scott: Yeah, and they you know, what else is going on in the show?

546
00:37:56,771 --> 00:37:57,754
Scott: I mean the characters.

547
00:37:57,995 --> 00:37:59,921
Scott: it seems like, you know Like.

548
00:38:00,683 --> 00:38:06,540
Scott: the characters don't really have like, you know, they're not very complex, you know, it's pretty much like he's the fat guy.

549
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:17,040
Scott: He she's the hot girl who has awesome powers, but won't use them because of some reason, you know He's the kid with a bunch of responsibility on his shoulders, you know, I mean, I've only watched two episodes.

550
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,105
Scott: But you know the characters.

551
00:38:18,687 --> 00:38:19,370
Scott: it's sort of like.

552
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:20,314
Scott: they're just these.

553
00:38:20,535 --> 00:38:21,580
Scott: like, you know archetypes.

554
00:38:22,186 --> 00:38:23,199
Rym: That's exactly what they are.

555
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,264
Rym: They're larger than life.

556
00:38:24,324 --> 00:38:35,099
Rym: the music the style everything in the show is so larger than life both directly and I guess on the meta perspective that the characters are all like the embodiment of some idea or something.

557
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:35,400
Rym: and they're.

558
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,857
Rym: They're bigger than a real character could possibly be but they're more complex than you'll give them credit for.

559
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:46,240
Rym: you see the rest of the Show, they're not as simple as they appear right away except for Tetsukyo a big stupid axe guy.

560
00:38:46,341 --> 00:38:55,720
Scott: He is exactly what he appears to be, you know I mean like some of them, you know I mean they're cool in their style and such like the guy with the inner pole guy with the red coat.

561
00:38:55,881 --> 00:38:56,744
Scott: He's got a good style.

562
00:38:56,764 --> 00:38:59,213
Rym: Oh, you don't even have any idea his character.

563
00:38:59,595 --> 00:39:00,739
Rym: There's stuff about him.

564
00:39:01,544 --> 00:39:03,518
Scott: yeah, I'm sure there is you know, and it's like the.

565
00:39:04,721 --> 00:39:05,545
Scott: You know sort of like this.

566
00:39:05,625 --> 00:39:06,188
Scott: there's always those.

567
00:39:06,208 --> 00:39:08,920
Scott: there's a lot of those characters who sort of like they don't do too much.

568
00:39:09,161 --> 00:39:10,084
Scott: You know, they've always got that.

569
00:39:10,104 --> 00:39:13,558
Scott: that's like it's the old Simpsons guy in the white suit just standing there.

570
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:17,819
Rym: Exactly There's a whole lot of that going on.

571
00:39:18,703 --> 00:39:23,980
Rym: The way I will put it is that every character is kind of set up to be too big like the show can't contain them.

572
00:39:24,901 --> 00:39:38,599
Rym: every single one of them is going to have their Final Fantasy 4 moments the moment where they just like bust out in the most of like crazy possible way and fulfill everything they could possibly be.

573
00:39:38,619 --> 00:39:45,320
Rym: and Like it's like every character has a scene like in Read or Die when they take that paper airplane and jump off the roof.

574
00:39:46,661 --> 00:39:47,966
Scott: Yeah, I guess kind of.

575
00:39:48,027 --> 00:39:49,292
Scott: but you know, it's like it's all.

576
00:39:49,312 --> 00:39:51,120
Scott: that's all like action kind of stuff.

577
00:39:51,301 --> 00:39:54,171
Rym: Yeah, it is actually it's action and just I don't know.

578
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:56,118
Rym: I don't know why this isn't resonating with you so much.

579
00:39:56,138 --> 00:40:08,119
Rym: the show is just Everything is larger than life and over the top but it's balanced by this kind of very serious treatment and very Serious and poignant use of music and theme at the same time.

580
00:40:08,802 --> 00:40:13,559
Scott: The other thing that gets me is like you've got this sort of you know mystery going on right about.

581
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:21,557
Scott: you know Oh, what was best darl and then you find that out, but then there's still other mysteries, you know Like the guy's like I'll tell you the truth and then he doesn't because he dies.

582
00:40:21,638 --> 00:40:23,166
Scott: and you know It's like all this kind of stuff.

583
00:40:23,628 --> 00:40:25,660
Scott: and you want to know like what is really going on.

584
00:40:25,981 --> 00:40:28,113
Scott: What is you know, how does this thing really work?

585
00:40:28,214 --> 00:40:29,280
Scott: Why is it this way?

586
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:34,140
Scott: This is a point of what happened in the past and the thing, you know, I mean, it's it's you know, it's a mystery.

587
00:40:34,302 --> 00:40:38,620
Scott: I want to know what happens, you know I'm intrigued to discover the secrets.

588
00:40:39,001 --> 00:40:51,810
Scott: The thing is it seems like they just sort of like repeat a lot of things over and over again Like they show like I've watched two so far Vogler and they're like, oh don't turn on the thing.

589
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:52,754
Rym: He's like fuck you.

590
00:40:52,794 --> 00:40:54,160
Rym: Haha, and he turns down the thing.

591
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,608
Scott: I've seen that flashback like ten times.

592
00:40:56,668 --> 00:40:56,969
Scott: All right.

593
00:40:57,089 --> 00:41:06,860
Rym: All right, I'm playing I'm not there is no spoiler here But that is very very intentional and done to great effect in this show.

594
00:41:07,421 --> 00:41:13,219
Scott: Yeah, I mean it's you know, sometimes they you know, they flashback they show a little more a little less than you know.

595
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,072
Rym: No, no, really pretty much show you don't be the same thing.

596
00:41:16,112 --> 00:41:16,856
Scott: I've seen this before.

597
00:41:16,896 --> 00:41:17,620
Scott: show me something new.

598
00:41:18,102 --> 00:41:22,920
Rym: They do it on purpose because it's a show that kind of presents to you a reality of the world.

599
00:41:23,381 --> 00:41:24,626
Rym: These are the good guys.

600
00:41:24,987 --> 00:41:26,151
Rym: These are the bad guys.

601
00:41:26,572 --> 00:41:29,000
Rym: This guy is doing evil this dies doing good.

602
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:29,924
Rym: These people want this.

603
00:41:29,944 --> 00:41:30,668
Rym: these people want this.

604
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:31,532
Rym: these people want this.

605
00:41:32,135 --> 00:41:33,300
Rym: This is what happened in the past.

606
00:41:33,401 --> 00:41:42,883
Rym: we don't know what's gonna happen in the future and they They kind of the show like a big climax of the show near the end is they show you you know The.

607
00:41:43,164 --> 00:41:44,814
Rym: the flashbacks are always very consistent.

608
00:41:44,834 --> 00:41:45,840
Rym: It's like nothing changes them.

609
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:52,684
Rym: It's not like you Tana where like you see things differently as people learn different things and this it's exactly In this.

610
00:41:52,725 --> 00:42:09,196
Rym: what'll happen is at some point near the end of the show You see a flashback to like two minutes before the flashback you kept seeing and It changes everything but not in like a dumb dares ex mocking away, but in a oh shit.

611
00:42:09,296 --> 00:42:13,833
Scott: Really kind of way Yeah, but it's I can already sort of figure out.

612
00:42:13,973 --> 00:42:15,419
Rym: Can you what do you think the deal is?

613
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,367
Rym: I'm curious because this can't be a spoiler.

614
00:42:17,388 --> 00:42:18,533
Rym: You're guessing you don't know.

615
00:42:18,553 --> 00:42:20,019
Scott: What do I think the deal is?

616
00:42:20,059 --> 00:42:21,256
Rym: Yes What do you think the deal is?

617
00:42:21,882 --> 00:42:25,276
Scott: Well, first of all, right they make vulgar to be out like this like this.

618
00:42:25,316 --> 00:42:26,160
Scott: bad, dude, right.

619
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:35,860
Scott: Yeah, you know there was an experiment and he purposefully, you know did the experiment got real wrong and he knew it You know, there was a big risk and of course the big badness happened.

620
00:42:35,981 --> 00:42:41,624
Scott: right and all the other scientists try to stop him, but the Shizuma, right?

621
00:42:42,025 --> 00:42:43,490
Scott: He's basically the whole time.

622
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:44,975
Scott: He's like, oh forgive me.

623
00:42:45,276 --> 00:42:46,560
Scott: Oh, I have penance, right?

624
00:42:46,941 --> 00:42:54,723
Scott: So it is obvious that he actually did something horrible, right if there's no question about that whatsoever Right.

625
00:42:54,763 --> 00:42:57,611
Scott: So what horrible thing did he do?

626
00:42:57,752 --> 00:43:07,216
Scott: and it's probably something along the lines of you know When they were working on that technology, you know, maybe it's actually Babies or you know, it's something like that.

627
00:43:07,277 --> 00:43:14,904
Scott: is you know like he's the one who actually did something that was wrong and there was a reason that Vogler did what he did.

628
00:43:14,985 --> 00:43:22,184
Scott: that makes sense in the context of you know, some evil thing that Shizuma perpetrated and you know They betrayed Vogler.

629
00:43:22,204 --> 00:43:28,100
Scott: That's why they were all famous and he was like presumed dead and you know forgotten intentionally and something like that.

630
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:39,955
Rym: what I will say is that you know you pointed out that you didn't think the characters were terribly complex and There's definitely the implication that the plot is not terribly complex other than the I guess artificial complexity of the Baphomet ads.

631
00:43:40,035 --> 00:43:42,184
Rym: I'm gonna call him the Technology the.

632
00:43:42,325 --> 00:43:48,147
Rym: oh, she's gonna drive something something I a Vogler something something but That I oh my god.

633
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:58,739
Rym: There's a scene near the end where a character says to another character words to the effect of what did you expect me to do?

634
00:44:00,882 --> 00:44:06,139
Rym: And that is possibly the saddest moment in it like of all anime I've ever seen.

635
00:44:07,124 --> 00:44:14,038
Rym: That ranks in the top 10 of the saddest Moments ever just when the characters like what did you expect me to do?

636
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:18,013
Rym: But is it?

637
00:44:18,153 --> 00:44:24,930
Rym: I guess the show like there's the tragedy of our star and all these mysteries and they kind of reveal them all And you start to like there's like 20th century.

638
00:44:25,694 --> 00:44:29,880
Rym: They're trying to figure out too Like what is the deal with the special samples?

639
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:36,001
Rym: and they got the bad guys have two and the good guys have one and oh Shit, the baby all three to really make shit.

640
00:44:36,202 --> 00:44:38,210
Rym: Oh shit if the bad guys get all three.

641
00:44:38,835 --> 00:44:53,460
Rym: But they actually you know The characters kind of smartly are experimenting and they try to figure it out and stuff happens and I guess Everything is completely self referentially consistent In a seven episode OAV.

642
00:44:53,501 --> 00:44:56,253
Scott: if you're not self, you know consistent That's a big.

643
00:44:56,334 --> 00:45:03,603
Rym: but it's also consistent in a. it's not just a technobabble answer at the end Like it's not just a oh the blah blah blah and we save the day.

644
00:45:03,623 --> 00:45:05,148
Rym: It's a lot more complex than that.

645
00:45:06,034 --> 00:45:09,570
Rym: mm-hmm really sad - Lot of people guys.

646
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:24,077
Rym: Yeah This is a show for you guys out there where the tragedy of the past that no one will talk about Killed like two-thirds the world's population.

647
00:45:24,097 --> 00:45:27,808
Rym: Yeah, and what they're fighting now is far worse than that.

648
00:45:28,692 --> 00:45:34,969
Scott: The one thing that like it's weird because there are other there, you know that main mystery They pay a lot of attention to you know.

649
00:45:35,471 --> 00:45:58,309
Scott: Which is weird because usually what other shows do is they'll have like this core mystery But they'll spend a lot of attention to other things and they'll only get back to the core at the very end right, whereas giant robo is basically constantly focusing on this core mystery and They're pretty much ignoring like all these other things that are out there Like for example giant robo himself, right the kids dad made giant robo,

650
00:45:58,329 --> 00:45:58,630
Rym: right?

651
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:00,718
Scott: And you know that you know is whatever.

652
00:46:01,321 --> 00:46:03,310
Scott: but like they don't like who is the kids dad?

653
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:04,876
Scott: They don't even talk about that at all.

654
00:46:04,936 --> 00:46:08,790
Scott: Like, you know, the it barely gets any screen time, you know that question.

655
00:46:08,931 --> 00:46:09,757
Rym: Well, I mean part of that.

656
00:46:09,777 --> 00:46:11,410
Rym: look it throws you in in media res.

657
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:17,090
Rym: So you have no idea who the experts of justice are or who big fire is.

658
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:18,377
Rym: We'll talk about big fire in a minute.

659
00:46:18,397 --> 00:46:20,347
Rym: We got a. we have to talk about that.

660
00:46:20,367 --> 00:46:22,237
Rym: Especially What do they want?

661
00:46:22,297 --> 00:46:24,329
Scott: big if I out how many?

662
00:46:24,349 --> 00:46:27,996
Rym: ah Basically I love big fire.

663
00:46:28,277 --> 00:46:31,990
Rym: They're possibly my there's something about a name like big fire.

664
00:46:33,259 --> 00:46:42,830
Rym: It's a good name And the way they drive the fact that you know, they're like yes big fire But in the context of the anime, they're like the BF a group.

665
00:46:46,853 --> 00:47:00,510
Rym: So did you get to the point not really spoiler where the the eye of frankenpfon fogler Activates and like everything starts shutting down and it cuts to all the big fire bases all around the world having trouble?

666
00:47:01,831 --> 00:47:02,594
Scott: No, it's just so.

667
00:47:02,635 --> 00:47:03,779
Scott: I mean it's floating around.

668
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:08,450
Rym: so there's there's the scene where you kind of learn It didn't activate that much only activate a little bit.

669
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:16,894
Rym: Well, you kind of learned I guess the the extent of big fires evil network where like stuff starts shutting down all over the place It's even hurting big fire.

670
00:47:17,395 --> 00:47:22,590
Rym: So suddenly in the main big fire headquarters, you see like big fire Antarctica calling in.

671
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:24,296
Rym: They're like everyone's freezing to death.

672
00:47:24,357 --> 00:47:24,939
Rym: What do we do?

673
00:47:25,441 --> 00:47:27,930
Rym: and then like big fire the moon calls in?

674
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:29,381
Rym: Everything's fine here.

675
00:47:29,824 --> 00:47:30,449
Rym: Fuck you all.

676
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:38,309
Rym: But then you see like this hint there's a big fire base that is under the White House just waiting to invade.

677
00:47:38,329 --> 00:47:43,526
Rym: it Like that like big fire has bases in like everybody's closet.

678
00:47:43,586 --> 00:47:49,041
Scott: as far as I can tell How many people if two-thirds of the world population died.

679
00:47:49,081 --> 00:47:49,984
Scott: how many people can?

680
00:47:50,064 --> 00:47:51,910
Scott: it's like half the world must be in big fire.

681
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:53,736
Rym: That's that's what's great about this show.

682
00:47:53,777 --> 00:48:13,747
Rym: Like you've only seen the beginning it just gets more and more over the top like It's as though big O in the first episode punch someone with that punch and in the next episode Like grew another piston on that punch and by the end of the episode like use the entire earth as the piston to punch another evil earth.

683
00:48:15,813 --> 00:48:18,009
Rym: That's kind of what happens in John and Gurren Lagann.

684
00:48:19,494 --> 00:48:28,236
Rym: Giant Robo doesn't quite go that far But I guess ideologically it does because really notice how like even in the first couple episodes like giant Robo Doesn't really do too much.

685
00:48:28,256 --> 00:48:31,530
Rym: The giant robot fights are basically big O punch and it's done.

686
00:48:32,294 --> 00:48:40,050
Scott: But the characters fight like giant robots Like the characters are like they fight like street fighter people with more superpowers.

687
00:48:40,110 --> 00:48:54,885
Rym: yeah, let it go a little bit further where a guy gets shot the way a giant robot would get shot and basically his whole torso is missing the same as if a giant Robo had been shot and he's basically standing there and he's like Well, you may have destroyed me but blah blah blah

688
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:57,090
Scott: Yeah.

689
00:48:58,354 --> 00:49:01,244
Rym: So at least you got to see my favorite villain in all anime ever.

690
00:49:01,284 --> 00:49:03,070
Rym: now Albert to the impact.

691
00:49:04,335 --> 00:49:05,309
Scott: Did I see I guess?

692
00:49:06,993 --> 00:49:08,507
Rym: The steampunk kind of thing on his eye?

693
00:49:09,103 --> 00:49:16,880
Rym: Yeah so that guy that guy gets more and more and more awesome as the show goes on and he's Seems like the people he's with.

694
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:24,410
Rym: they're sort of incompetent though Yeah, but at the same time you haven't met all of the magnificent ten because there's kind of there's no right there like magnificent ten.

695
00:49:24,491 --> 00:49:30,276
Scott: It's like I've only seen two or three of them And when you meet the rest of them you've only got seven episodes.

696
00:49:30,517 --> 00:49:37,570
Rym: like the experts of justice are all great and later in the show you meet like Ten more experts of justice basically.

697
00:49:38,052 --> 00:49:43,450
Rym: But then there's magnificent ten and there's so much cooler and more badass than the experts of justice.

698
00:49:44,534 --> 00:49:47,516
Scott: Yeah, I mean, there's that one Magnificent ten guy with the.

699
00:49:47,556 --> 00:49:50,786
Scott: he's not like the oni mask and he just doesn't say cool.

700
00:49:50,826 --> 00:49:51,327
Rym: What's his name?

701
00:49:51,368 --> 00:49:52,130
Rym: That guy's scary.

702
00:49:52,231 --> 00:49:53,969
Rym: He's like he's the scariest dude.

703
00:49:54,090 --> 00:49:54,833
Rym: You see you feel like.

704
00:49:54,853 --> 00:49:57,964
Scott: I always like that kind of character that guy who doesn't say anything.

705
00:49:58,085 --> 00:49:59,450
Scott: He's obviously mysteriously.

706
00:50:00,194 --> 00:50:01,641
Scott: You don't know what his powers are.

707
00:50:01,701 --> 00:50:03,310
Scott: He's just quiet and off to the side.

708
00:50:03,390 --> 00:50:10,498
Rym: Yeah when Albert the impacts flunky is like you fucker when they have that evil meeting and then co just kind of Shows up behind him.

709
00:50:10,518 --> 00:50:11,303
Rym: He's like, I'll kill you.

710
00:50:11,323 --> 00:50:16,023
Rym: I don't even blink Like I can kill you without expanding any effort.

711
00:50:16,043 --> 00:50:27,358
Scott: and Albert's like, all right, so then guys I Was like that kind of guy, you know, I basically if I was Mama, Roshi, I wouldn't have a dog.

712
00:50:27,378 --> 00:50:32,970
Scott: I would have a you know, a quiet guy who's mysteriously and incredibly powerful.

713
00:50:33,518 --> 00:50:36,904
Scott: Or you know It seems like he's incredibly powerful.

714
00:50:36,924 --> 00:50:37,929
Scott: He just doesn't do anything.

715
00:50:38,712 --> 00:50:48,826
Rym: So I got to talk a little bit too about the head of you know, the guy who's obviously the chief the boss He he's been gatekeepers basically had the same guy in charge.

716
00:50:48,866 --> 00:50:49,730
Rym: as far as I can say.

717
00:50:50,511 --> 00:50:54,690
Scott: Yeah, I mean well big fire the generic big fire guys are very similar to the geeky.

718
00:50:54,730 --> 00:51:02,410
Rym: You know, there's a lot of gatekeepers parallels just in general I guess I kind of realize I guess I like the gatekeepers when I first saw the same sort of thing.

719
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:08,450
Scott: There's a team, you know of good guys, you know, they're all different archetype characters, right?

720
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:17,530
Scott: and there's a. there's a bad organization that has a bunch of identical henchmen and You know, it's they have this really sort of dramatic like go get him.

721
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:19,356
Scott: Yes, beat the bad guy kind of.

722
00:51:19,516 --> 00:51:23,830
Scott: you know mood about them, you know, it there's a lot of it's sort of.

723
00:51:25,374 --> 00:51:32,455
Scott: You know, it's it's common in a lot of Japanese things, you know, like the giant robot shows the old, you know They have the same.

724
00:51:32,536 --> 00:51:34,750
Rym: I guess I guess what I was saying is the gatekeepers.

725
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:40,110
Rym: I liked it when I first saw it and now I saw it long after I gave up on giant robo.

726
00:51:40,912 --> 00:51:51,290
Rym: Now that I see giant robo and I'm older I realize Everything I liked about gatekeepers was something that was basically either homage or parody or stolen from giant robo like that.

727
00:51:51,572 --> 00:51:55,230
Rym: I don't know if it came from giant robo Or at least from that kind of show.

728
00:51:55,230 --> 00:52:03,810
Rym: These are long, these are old tropes At least from that kind of show, but you've got to admit the commander is they're basically the same guy.

729
00:52:04,332 --> 00:52:08,044
Scott: Yeah, I mean, of course, you know every the commanders are.

730
00:52:08,124 --> 00:52:09,409
Scott: there's pretty much three kind.

731
00:52:09,449 --> 00:52:14,306
Scott: two kind Most commanders in anime like ship captains, right?

732
00:52:14,346 --> 00:52:19,270
Rym: They're You know, there's always exceptions, but a lot of them are acting global.

733
00:52:19,992 --> 00:52:23,403
Scott: Yeah, the captain global kind where they sit there quietly and they're real smart.

734
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:28,177
Scott: Yeah, and then there's and then there's the Kind which is like attack.

735
00:52:28,659 --> 00:52:29,723
Rym: This kind is not just attack.

736
00:52:29,744 --> 00:52:31,250
Rym: This kind is the attack.

737
00:52:32,193 --> 00:52:34,741
Rym: I have a full power that I am NOT using.

738
00:52:35,302 --> 00:52:37,670
Rym: I will only intervene if all else is lost.

739
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:40,121
Rym: It's like he's just waiting there with his fists.

740
00:52:40,201 --> 00:52:42,010
Rym: Like eventually I'm gonna punch someone.

741
00:52:42,512 --> 00:52:46,430
Scott: Yeah, there's a whole lot of that, you know, don't use yours, you know full power.

742
00:52:46,792 --> 00:52:49,550
Scott: You know only use the amount of power you have to like in ray.

743
00:52:49,711 --> 00:52:53,346
Scott: It's like you don't don't use your power again ray ever, you know, you shouldn't have.

744
00:52:53,707 --> 00:52:57,409
Rym: you know in Japan It's an insult to use your full power at any course.

745
00:52:58,373 --> 00:52:58,834
Scott: You know you.

746
00:52:58,874 --> 00:53:03,430
Scott: only you have to slowly amplify your power and use stronger and stronger attacks.

747
00:53:04,353 --> 00:53:06,800
Rym: Like I'm gonna spoil you never have to.

748
00:53:07,302 --> 00:53:11,033
Rym: I'm gonna spoil one small thing the chief because you know everyone's a superpower.

749
00:53:11,094 --> 00:53:11,354
Rym: notice

750
00:53:11,374 --> 00:53:11,936
Scott: how I don't

751
00:53:11,956 --> 00:53:29,465
Rym: know if you saw when the Greta Garbo best name for a ship ever gets attacked and Albert is like busting in and you see like all the normal dudes Attacking like they're superheroes basically like minor superheroes Like everybody has powers in this show at one point a bunch of normal.

752
00:53:29,585 --> 00:53:30,770
Scott: That's part of the plot, too.

753
00:53:30,850 --> 00:53:37,550
Scott: You know, maybe that's you know, something about the Shizuma Drive something something has to do with the fact that everyone has freakin superpowers.

754
00:53:37,791 --> 00:53:44,557
Rym: But there's a point at which a bunch of normal dudes form up like they're forming a combining robot Just like gatekeepers.

755
00:53:44,758 --> 00:53:47,232
Rym: Yeah, they all like form together just like that It's it's.

756
00:53:47,694 --> 00:53:51,249
Rym: it's only for a second like you might even miss it cuz it's so quick, but it's totally there.

757
00:53:52,550 --> 00:54:07,614
Rym: but the chief his power cuz everyone has a power is Basically that he can charge up this punch like he can just be like I'm gonna punch you now You little guy and if he punches something whatever it is, he could punch the earth.

758
00:54:07,895 --> 00:54:09,479
Rym: earth is dead earth is gone.

759
00:54:10,663 --> 00:54:12,636

Rym: No But I don't know this show especially.

779
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:59,380
Rym: I'm curious to hear what you have to say when you've seen the whole show because they kind of reveal Everything and the I guess, you know, depending what the reveals are Determines a lot about what I'm gonna think about.

780
00:56:00,701 --> 00:56:02,989
Scott: It's revealed and it's like oh, yeah, whatever.

781
00:56:03,009 --> 00:56:04,254
Scott: I saw that coming.

782
00:56:04,274 --> 00:56:05,036
Scott: then it's like, okay.

783
00:56:05,097 --> 00:56:06,060
Rym: This is the show.

784
00:56:06,783 --> 00:56:09,874
Scott: I never would have thought of that and what I didn't think of is awesome.

785
00:56:10,155 --> 00:56:20,970
Rym: Remember way way back We saw this try gun AMV and in the beginning of the AMV It shows a scene from giant Robo where a dude is like talking to the main character and then he just shoots himself in the head.

786
00:56:22,824 --> 00:56:23,796
Rym: No, you don't remember that.

787
00:56:24,902 --> 00:56:25,807
Rym: I'll show it to you after the show.

788
00:56:25,848 --> 00:56:42,998
Rym: This is basically it's the scene where a Character it from giant Robo who you will recognize is talking to the kid who pilots giant Robo and he stands there And he says a bunch of stuff on top of a like mountain of discarded shoes image drives and then while smiling He just shoots himself in the head.

789
00:56:43,883 --> 00:56:45,890
Rym: All right, that's that's from giant Robo.

790
00:56:46,011 --> 00:56:48,520
Rym: That's that's kind of to give you an idea where the show goes.

791
00:56:49,761 --> 00:56:51,350
Scott: Someone's gonna all right.

792
00:56:51,390 --> 00:56:52,094
Scott: That's interesting.

793
00:56:52,235 --> 00:56:56,162
Rym: Yeah All right, I Don't know.

794
00:56:56,182 --> 00:56:58,079
Rym: we just we talked about this off the show.

795
00:56:58,764 --> 00:57:01,320
Rym: I think is great and Scott doesn't think it's that great.

796
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:15,778
Rym: But I'll say this if you consider yourself an anime fan at all You should watch at least one episode of giant Robo because one I think a lot of people who think they won't like a show Like this will probably really really like it

797
00:57:17,042 --> 00:57:19,600
Scott: Say well, I don't think it's you know, so amazing.

798
00:57:19,801 --> 00:57:33,240
Rym: I can definitely tell that I a lot of people most people looking at this will think it's totally awesome But also anime fan type people even if you don't like it You have to have seen it so you can at least talk about it or shows like it.

799
00:57:33,724 --> 00:57:37,247
Rym: I mean if you've never seen a show like this How do you know you don't like them?

800
00:57:37,568 --> 00:57:38,853
Rym: and how do you know they're bad?

801
00:57:38,893 --> 00:57:40,600
Rym: and how can you even say they're bad?

802
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:42,059
Rym: How can you say anything about anime?

803
00:57:45,442 --> 00:57:46,286
Rym: The show is great.

804
00:57:46,306 --> 00:57:47,552
Rym: I want to watch it again.

805
00:57:47,592 --> 00:57:49,140
Rym: I'm watching it with Emily actually right now.

806
00:57:50,244 --> 00:57:52,508
Scott: Uh-huh How can you watch it?

807
00:57:52,549 --> 00:57:53,436
Scott: You gave me the discs?

808
00:57:53,739 --> 00:57:57,979
Rym: Yeah Well, we temporarily stopped watching it so you can watch it and then we're gonna continue watching it.

809
00:57:58,743 --> 00:58:02,420
Rym: All right, plus I still have the third disc and the Gin Ray special which you should not watch.

810
00:58:04,263 --> 00:58:10,978
Rym: It's just kind of funny and dumb but it It's kind of a travesty if you already know how giant Robo ends to watch the Gin Ray special.

811
00:58:12,741 --> 00:58:20,120
Rym: Imagine if cowboy bebop had be like spike and vicious and Julia go to the beach episode like after the show.

812
00:58:22,623 --> 00:58:23,939
Rym: That's what that's like to watch.
