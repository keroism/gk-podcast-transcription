00:00:15,499 --> 00:00:18,859
Rym: ha Sienna That was stupid.

6
00:00:25,911 --> 00:00:26,927
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:35,534
Rym: We're back from Connecticut, and we finally have a break at least a little bit of a break also.

8
00:00:35,555 --> 00:00:36,738
Scott: We live beware.

9
00:00:38,921 --> 00:00:41,630
Rym: Yes, you could say something like that along those lines.

10
00:00:41,871 --> 00:00:43,858
Rym: We didn't really miss any episodes because we.

11
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:52,524
Scott: Thankfully much as I think the reason we didn't miss episodes is because I'm not sure if last week was actually supposed to be A Monday Wednesday week.

12
00:00:52,544 --> 00:00:54,872
Scott: we sort of did that for convenience sake.

13
00:00:55,374 --> 00:00:56,980
Rym: it was but we've messed it up previously.

14
00:00:57,021 --> 00:00:58,219
Rym: It doesn't really matter yeah.

15
00:00:58,682 --> 00:01:04,290
Rym: But I'm very glad that despite the fact that I really wanted to go as I always do that We didn't go to SDCC.

16
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:09,470
Rym: that just would have been too much No, but we will go eventually maybe next year.

17
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:10,634
Scott: Maybe the year after.

18
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:13,903
Scott: you know the thing is it's so Hollywood.

19
00:01:14,145 --> 00:01:15,839
Scott: I'm not really in a big rush.

20
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:26,200
Scott: You know it's like and if I did go like I wouldn't actually You know because I would just refuse like if I go into San Diego right I'm not gonna waste my time waiting in lines.

21
00:01:27,201 --> 00:01:30,957
Scott: So if I do go to that I'm only gonna go to stuff that doesn't have big lines.

22
00:01:30,977 --> 00:01:33,800
Rym: if you don't want to wait in Lines you're not gonna get to see any of the cool stuff.

23
00:01:33,942 --> 00:01:41,280
Scott: Well, I get to see all the stuff on the floor But I wouldn't get to see any event type stuff unless I got in line way early, but luckily it does have four days.

24
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:45,152
Scott: So You sort of do have time to see.

25
00:01:45,332 --> 00:01:46,720
Scott: you know to wait in a couple lines.

26
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:53,260
Scott: But yeah, if I plus if I went there it also just want to spend some time in San Diego someplace.

27
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:57,438
Scott: I've never been where I hear the weather is perfect every day, so yeah, yeah.

28
00:01:58,282 --> 00:02:00,399
Rym: But anyway had a more personal note before we get into this.

29
00:02:01,381 --> 00:02:03,409
Rym: My bike got stolen.

30
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:09,275
Rym: Oh shit now the worst thing is my whole life I've been biking like basically for as long as I could walk.

31
00:02:09,294 --> 00:02:10,120
Rym: I've always had a bike.

32
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,550
Scott: I've had two bikes stone.

33
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,020
Rym: I always carried a little bike lock.

34
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,493
Rym: I've never had a bike stolen in my life and while I always locked my bike.

35
00:02:17,176 --> 00:02:22,466
Rym: I never worried about it I always just thought you know what no one would steal my bike, and I locked it just because you know I kind of did.

36
00:02:22,526 --> 00:02:26,390
Rym: it was just this thing and One day you know a couple days ago.

37
00:02:26,671 --> 00:02:28,280
Rym: I rode my bike to the train station in a hurry.

38
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,060
Rym: You know I was almost gonna miss my train, and I forgot my bike lock, so I thought you know what?

39
00:02:33,842 --> 00:02:35,699
Rym: I'm just gonna leave it here with all the other bikes.

40
00:02:36,302 --> 00:02:37,045
Rym: What are the odds?

41
00:02:37,105 --> 00:02:37,567
Rym: and you know what?

42
00:02:37,587 --> 00:02:40,960
Rym: a hundred percent the one time in my life that I ever don't like my bike up.

43
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:45,158
Scott: It is stolen immediately, so I got some bike stealing stories, right?

44
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,668
Rym: Well the thing is though.

45
00:02:46,991 --> 00:02:49,207
Rym: I'm Beacons not that big.

46
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,660
Rym: unless some kid just stole it and ditched it in the woods.

47
00:02:52,182 --> 00:02:58,669
Rym: I'm gonna see some punk kid biking around on my very obviously mine bike Possibly, but here.

48
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:00,639
Scott: I got two bike stealing stories, right?

49
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,500
Scott: I'll tell the less interesting one first even though that's reverse chronological order.

50
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,779
Rym: All right, I was uh I had a bike right let me guess and then it got stolen.

51
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:10,684
Scott: now it was.

52
00:03:10,785 --> 00:03:12,757
Scott: it was at my house, and I was at summer camp.

53
00:03:12,837 --> 00:03:18,560
Scott: right and I was at summer camp, and then we summer camp went on a field trip to Dorney Park.

54
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,824
Scott: I think so.

55
00:03:19,844 --> 00:03:25,700
Scott: whenever you're on a field trip at summer camp you always use the payphone to call your parents collect right in those non cell phone days.

56
00:03:26,262 --> 00:03:26,543
Scott: Right.

57
00:03:27,145 --> 00:03:33,528
Scott: so I did and that's when I found out my bike was stolen while I wasn't there And I had left it locked up.

58
00:03:33,568 --> 00:03:39,771
Scott: so that means when I was away somebody else You know did something not so good.

59
00:03:39,951 --> 00:03:40,052
Rym: Well.

60
00:03:40,072 --> 00:03:40,694
Rym: We had locked up.

61
00:03:40,714 --> 00:03:41,637
Rym: We're like at your house.

62
00:03:41,677 --> 00:03:42,359
Scott: Yeah my house.

63
00:03:43,002 --> 00:03:46,054
Rym: I can't imagine a bike being stolen from someone's house.

64
00:03:46,074 --> 00:03:46,395
Rym: Perhaps.

65
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:50,694
Scott: I should ask my parents again Maybe now they will admit that like they were poor and I don't know they're not.

66
00:03:50,815 --> 00:03:56,038
Scott: they were never poor But you know they sold it needed money or gave it away, or who knows what anyway?

67
00:03:57,922 --> 00:04:09,260
Scott: Here's the more interesting story right You Know back in the olden days when he's to hang out with the kids on the block We all rode the bikes around like a bicycle gang, but there was no other gang.

68
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,831
Scott: It was just us and just three streets, and that was it.

69
00:04:11,911 --> 00:04:13,880
Rym: we had a rival gang and we had like eight streets.

70
00:04:14,303 --> 00:04:27,353
Scott: Oh, yeah, that's suburbia, so We you know I dropped the bike on the lawn, and I went in the house was playing some video games Heard some noise outside looked out the window saw some people biking past.

71
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:31,300
Scott: that were not anyone we knew But I didn't pay much attention to it.

72
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:35,660
Scott: I just sort of noticed it cuz you know it was a quiet weekend day nice and sunny out right.

73
00:04:36,601 --> 00:04:40,100
Scott: Then we sort of realized bike was missing and my friend's bike was missing, too.

74
00:04:40,161 --> 00:04:46,360
Scott: He also left his on his lawn And it was like what the hell some kids must have come down our street and took all our bikes and then biked away.

75
00:04:47,842 --> 00:04:50,680
Scott: So you know I guess you know there was some police call-in action.

76
00:04:50,941 --> 00:04:54,778
Scott: Whatever it was like in the days that were police would actually respond to a stolen bike.

77
00:04:54,798 --> 00:04:55,260
Rym: they respond.

78
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:56,773
Rym: I went to the beacon police station.

79
00:04:56,793 --> 00:05:04,887
Scott: I filed a report Like this was like you know respond as in a bunch of cops getting cars and start driving around Response looking for him.

80
00:05:05,128 --> 00:05:11,360
Rym: I'll bet if I'd been a kid as opposed to me I could have gotten the police and beacon to do that, but my dad also drove around.

81
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,890
Rym: Dad beat up some kid get your bike back.

82
00:05:14,493 --> 00:05:14,633
Scott: Well.

83
00:05:14,653 --> 00:05:15,979
Scott: He definitely got the bikes back.

84
00:05:16,581 --> 00:05:17,806
Scott: Bet my handlebars.

85
00:05:17,826 --> 00:05:25,840
Scott: I don't know if he beat anyone up, but I think he was like chasing them And then like the cops came from the other direction and the kids like jumped into the woods.

86
00:05:26,161 --> 00:05:28,892
Scott: You know it was a situation Wow.

87
00:05:29,153 --> 00:05:38,239
Scott: so even living in Detroit I never had anything like that, but well That's the thing is that it was such a non-crime place that you know a stolen bike was like cops are like hell's.

88
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:41,894
Rym: yeah I work to do, but bike never gets stolen in like Detroit.

89
00:05:41,914 --> 00:05:45,774
Rym: You know leaving it outside like the One wants a freaking bicycle.

90
00:05:45,835 --> 00:05:46,700
Rym: Are you kidding one day?

91
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,854
Rym: I was riding my bike to work and a gang of kids Attacked this other kid across the street beat him up and took his bike.

92
00:05:52,095 --> 00:05:55,939
Scott: wow yeah They must just not like the kid, why would they want the bicycle?

93
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:56,743
Scott: I mean they give.

94
00:05:56,763 --> 00:05:57,428
Scott: they're gonna do that.

95
00:05:57,488 --> 00:06:01,278
Scott: you can beat up someone to take a motorcycle Right if you're willing to beat someone up.

96
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:05,783
Rym: So well the thing is the kid was like seven and the kids have beat him up or like 14.

97
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:08,059
Rym: They're not gonna be beating anyone up who owns the motorcycle.

98
00:06:08,321 --> 00:06:13,521
Scott: Yes, yes, I don't understand though is like if you're willing to beat someone up to take something right you're already gonna be.

99
00:06:13,601 --> 00:06:28,206
Scott: you're already basically guilty of you know assault and robbery and such and such right and That that assault charge doesn't change depending on what you steal only the stealing burglary robbery large Changes based on what you steal.

100
00:06:28,527 --> 00:06:30,172
Rym: well it depends.

101
00:06:30,192 --> 00:06:31,837
Scott: so at least as far as I know.

102
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:34,106
Scott: not being a lawyer It's got any way shape or form.

103
00:06:34,187 --> 00:06:38,169
Rym: I've always you know when I think about committing crimes all the time It's the engineer's mind.

104
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:43,240
Rym: you look at the armored car And you know all geeks look at it and think I could take that I wanted out.

105
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,129
Scott: You know an armored car heist is like.

106
00:06:45,611 --> 00:06:46,857
Scott: I just want to do it to prove.

107
00:06:46,897 --> 00:06:47,400
Scott: I could do it.

108
00:06:48,023 --> 00:06:50,700
Rym: See that is that is the edge of the line.

109
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,464
Rym: You know it's like.

110
00:06:51,484 --> 00:06:54,460
Scott: I just want to be in the armored car and have them open the door and be like I dude it.

111
00:06:54,822 --> 00:06:56,435
Rym: It's just like that scene in Dominion tank.

112
00:06:56,455 --> 00:06:57,803
Scott: I don't want the money I just want to prove.

113
00:06:57,863 --> 00:06:59,772
Rym: I dude it where the head of the tank police like.

114
00:06:59,812 --> 00:07:01,540
Rym: what kind of world is this for the criminals?

115
00:07:01,841 --> 00:07:02,936
Rym: Blah blah, you know what?

116
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:04,763
Rym: Why don't we just run?

117
00:07:04,783 --> 00:07:06,391
Rym: I mean let you look around a bank.

118
00:07:06,652 --> 00:07:07,616
Rym: I've always wanted to.

119
00:07:07,676 --> 00:07:08,440
Rym: I've just been keeping myself.

120
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,991
Scott: I mean you look at that armored car.

121
00:07:10,051 --> 00:07:14,553
Scott: It's this big metal box That's meant to keep you out, and you're like I can fucking get in there.

122
00:07:14,613 --> 00:07:14,874
Scott: Hells.

123
00:07:14,914 --> 00:07:21,855
Scott: Yeah, that would be so fucking awesome You're not so they do everything they possibly can to keep you from getting in there.

124
00:07:22,136 --> 00:07:24,767
Scott: if you can get in there What's more badass than that?

125
00:07:25,209 --> 00:07:27,400
Rym: It's like a rabbit that lives with a lion.

126
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,804
Rym: Exactly anyway I just I can't believe.

127
00:07:30,844 --> 00:07:32,569
Rym: you know faith in humanity mine is.

128
00:07:32,609 --> 00:07:35,017
Rym: mine is that my whole life bike never gets stolen.

129
00:07:35,057 --> 00:07:40,220
Rym: the one time ever I leave it unlocked for like nine hours amidst a bunch of other bikes.

130
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,896
Rym: So that means that someone went up there and was looking for an unlocked bike.

131
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:52,498
Rym: Yep Oh Well, but ConnectiCon we were there last weekend, and we're not really gonna talk about it tonight because you know what.

132
00:07:52,678 --> 00:07:54,887
Rym: it's not a gaming Con it's not an anime con.

133
00:07:55,329 --> 00:07:56,233
Rym: It's a generic on.

134
00:07:56,253 --> 00:07:57,780
Rym: so we're going to talk about it on Thursday.

135
00:07:58,202 --> 00:08:02,600
Scott: Oh great excuse to fill up a Thursday episode for which we are sorely lacking ideas.

136
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,030
Rym: I got a ton of ideas.

137
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,500
Rym: you just never want to talk about him.

138
00:08:05,701 --> 00:08:09,838
Scott: It's a cop-out, but it is a totally valid cop-out, and it fills a Thursday episode.

139
00:08:09,878 --> 00:08:15,700
Rym: hooray We got to cover ConnectiCon right away, but yeah anyone who was in panel five that was our room.

Scott: you know how to call us.

152
00:09:04,936 --> 00:09:07,466
Scott: so We're waiting for you.

153
00:09:07,587 --> 00:09:10,280
Rym: Wow you trailed off and made that sound very unexciting.

154
00:09:10,561 --> 00:09:11,725
Scott: No, it's you know.

155
00:09:11,745 --> 00:09:14,094
Rym: ConnectiCon is great though for one reason one reason alone.

156
00:09:14,435 --> 00:09:14,897
Rym: We're there.

157
00:09:14,917 --> 00:09:19,880
Rym: and second reason I'm there Action Castle.

158
00:09:21,403 --> 00:09:24,711
Rym: I think Action Castle was the second most popular thing at the con after art fight.

159
00:09:24,892 --> 00:09:29,924
Rym: It's pretty popular all things considered alright, but anyway Gaming news.

160
00:09:29,964 --> 00:09:31,209
Rym: we got a little bit of gaming news.

161
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,113
Rym: Let's talk about packs.

162
00:09:32,133 --> 00:09:33,740
Scott: It's strangely light on gaming news.

163
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,788
Scott: I think everyone's saving for packs.

164
00:09:35,948 --> 00:09:38,940
Scott: in fact that is my my guess, but anyway packs.

165
00:09:40,021 --> 00:09:43,134
Scott: Due to the fact that there's still a little gaming news everyone saving it for packs.

166
00:09:43,676 --> 00:09:53,080
Rym: Let's just talk about packs Penny arcade expo which is pretty much the best gaming convention in the world in Seattle every year over Labor Day weekend.

167
00:09:53,262 --> 00:09:54,157
Scott: You know what I did today?

168
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,562
Rym: Thought about packs.

169
00:09:55,602 --> 00:10:00,257
Scott: well and my little tweets on my iPhone right I can have columns for tweet searches right.

170
00:10:00,297 --> 00:10:05,220
Scott: so I had a tweet search For Otakon so I would see everyone talking about Otakon even if I wasn't following.

171
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:10,982
Rym: You know as far as I can tell more people have tweeted about packs in the last month and tweeted about Otakon while Otakon was Going on.

172
00:10:11,163 --> 00:10:14,656
Scott: so then I you know I deleted that column and I created ConnectiCon column.

173
00:10:15,018 --> 00:10:18,040
Scott: then I today I deleted the ConnectiCon column and made a packs column.

174
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:21,950
Scott: So you know when I'm making a column for it that it's coming up.

175
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:28,227
Scott: so at packs we me and Rym are doing three Three five is right out.

176
00:10:28,308 --> 00:10:30,154
Scott: three panels three.

177
00:10:30,736 --> 00:10:34,711
Scott: they are beyond D&D Which is the same exact thing that we ran yes last year.

178
00:10:34,852 --> 00:10:36,880
Scott: only we are more practiced at it.

179
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,217
Scott: So it is slightly better, but it is the same material.

180
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,645
Rym: Captains you're making this your news.

181
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:42,790
Rym: What are these things scheduled?

182
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:43,412
Rym: What rooms?

183
00:10:43,975 --> 00:10:44,457
Scott: I don't know.

184
00:10:44,517 --> 00:10:45,280
Scott: you don't know all right.

185
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,951
Scott: It doesn't really matter beyond dungeons and dragons.

186
00:10:47,991 --> 00:10:51,647
Rym: We're reprising it on Sunday Sunday up.

187
00:10:51,687 --> 00:10:53,715
Rym: don't get sued in the Raven theater.

188
00:10:54,037 --> 00:10:57,106
Rym: Raven did One day back on Saturday.

189
00:10:57,146 --> 00:10:58,110
Rym: We're doing our new panel.

190
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,760
Rym: losing should be fun at 1030 in the Wolfman theater.

191
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,928
Scott: Yeah, we practice that at ConnectiCon pretty good and beyond.

192
00:11:03,968 --> 00:11:08,260
Rym: Candyland is Friday at 1130 a.m.. In the Raven theater again.

193
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:10,710
Scott: I wonder about that Friday 1130.

194
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,055
Scott: I hope it does not conflict.

195
00:11:12,095 --> 00:11:17,740
Scott: wait 1130 a.m Yeah, Wow packs didn't even start until like like what two or three last year, right?

196
00:11:18,162 --> 00:11:21,000
Rym: This is the tentative schedule, and they have not published the official schedule.

197
00:11:22,247 --> 00:11:23,714
Scott: They might be starting earlier this year.

198
00:11:23,755 --> 00:11:29,924
Scott: That's interesting, but anyway I hope that does not conflict with any of the things I would like to see such as Keynote etc.

199
00:11:29,944 --> 00:11:30,386
Scott: etc.

200
00:11:30,506 --> 00:11:31,672
Rym: thing is other than the keynote.

201
00:11:32,114 --> 00:11:40,540
Rym: I go to the concerts because they're awesome But the who what could someone possibly ask in the Q&A that will top last year's Q&A only really need to see that one?

202
00:11:40,581 --> 00:11:41,140
Scott: No, I don't know.

203
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:44,206
Scott: It's the only thing I'm concerned with Conflicting with is the keynote.

204
00:11:44,226 --> 00:11:44,387
Scott: like.

205
00:11:44,768 --> 00:11:48,987
Scott: I'd like to go to many of the other main events and things But I won't be like.

206
00:11:49,007 --> 00:11:49,509
Scott: you know.

207
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:56,800
Scott: I'd rather do my panel than do say I you know gave and taiko Q&A or the draw a comic panel which I missed last year.

208
00:11:57,001 --> 00:12:01,120
Rym: I do want to go to the Q&A just to continue the trend that we started last year.

209
00:12:01,501 --> 00:12:06,579
Scott: Yeah, but I do not want to miss the keynote for anything, so I hope that we do not conflict with it.

210
00:12:07,262 --> 00:12:12,380
Rym: But that aside don't forget that the penny arcade Expo East Coast is going to be in March in Boston.

211
00:12:12,822 --> 00:12:15,112
Scott: Is it the week before or the week after anime, but I don't know.

212
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:16,920
Rym: I haven't even figured out our schedule for panels yet.

213
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,560
Scott: Yeah, I got to figure out how I can stay in Boston for a whole week.

214
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,470
Scott: Hello friends who live in Boston get a couch ready.

215
00:12:22,931 --> 00:12:24,456
Rym: I'll probably just stay in a hotel.

216
00:12:24,797 --> 00:12:26,204
Scott: Maybe for a whole week I got money.

217
00:12:26,224 --> 00:12:27,513
Scott: It's a lot of money.

218
00:12:27,534 --> 00:12:28,360
Rym: It's not that much.

219
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:38,244
Scott: Maybe we can stay in a hotel during the con you know like right next to the convention center But then like the Monday through Thursday in between staying like a motel like a little bit out of the ways Mad cheap.

220
00:12:39,883 --> 00:12:44,365
Scott: It's a possibility some free internet as opposed to the expensive hotels Which usually don't have.

221
00:12:44,405 --> 00:12:47,398
Rym: my only debate is whether or not to take an entire week of vacation or?

222
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,189
Rym: To see if I can work quote unquote from home.

223
00:12:50,229 --> 00:12:52,539
Scott: That was my plan to work from quote unquote.

224
00:12:53,121 --> 00:12:54,005
Scott: Boston thing is.

225
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,958
Rym: I'd rather just not work and just have a vacation on the West Coast.

226
00:12:57,239 --> 00:12:59,648
Scott: I Mean I it's on the East Coast.

227
00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:00,431
Scott: Oh, yeah, Boston.

228
00:13:00,672 --> 00:13:03,263
Rym: I want to take a week off on the West Coast - yeah I liked it.

229
00:13:03,303 --> 00:13:10,539
Scott: well if I can get my work to let me go to Django con which is the week after packs then maybe I get to stay on the West Coast after packs.

230
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:15,472
Rym: and Except you already bought your plane ticket non-refundable back after packs didn't you?

231
00:13:16,294 --> 00:13:16,875
Scott: That's fun.

232
00:13:16,956 --> 00:13:18,821
Scott: Yeah, I can deal with that Can you?

233
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,248
Scott: hey I can cancel.

234
00:13:20,268 --> 00:13:21,976
Rym: it gotta pay a hundred bucks to cancel it now.

235
00:13:22,016 --> 00:13:22,739
Scott: You know how you do?

236
00:13:23,081 --> 00:13:24,325
Scott: No, it's not that bad.

237
00:13:24,787 --> 00:13:25,549
Rym: It's a hundred bucks though.

238
00:13:26,292 --> 00:13:26,975
Scott: It's not that bad.

239
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,460
Rym: It's not that bad, but it's a hundred bucks.

240
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,654
Scott: I don't know if it's a hundred bucks.

241
00:13:29,735 --> 00:13:31,785
Rym: It's a hot It's they're not jet blue.

242
00:13:31,826 --> 00:13:35,980
Rym: tickets like that are non-refundable, but it is a hundred dollars to change which includes the cancellation.

243
00:13:36,605 --> 00:13:39,012
Scott: Uh-huh Whatever doesn't matter.

244
00:13:39,032 --> 00:13:39,799
Rym: That's how it works.

245
00:13:40,582 --> 00:13:44,493
Scott: Hey my company if I thing is I'm staying out there as soon as PAX is over.

246
00:13:44,534 --> 00:13:45,697
Scott: It's my company's dime.

247
00:13:45,777 --> 00:13:48,945
Scott: So yeah I'll pay a hundred bucks.

248
00:13:49,025 --> 00:13:57,476
Scott: if that means I'm gonna basically they'll get me a rented car and they'll get me a You know hotel in Portland where I'm gonna have to stay for the Django con.

249
00:13:57,516 --> 00:13:58,460
Scott: and you know plus.

250
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:06,596
Rym: We'll see if this even happens right anyway, so in actual gaming news outside of conventions Namco Bandai or Bandai.

251
00:14:06,636 --> 00:14:11,823
Rym: Namco's Sales figures are out, and they're this longer part of all these things No one cares about.

252
00:14:11,883 --> 00:14:14,051
Rym: but for a quarter 1 2010 you know what.

253
00:14:14,092 --> 00:14:19,248
Rym: the top selling game that they made was Far and away almost double anything else.

254
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:22,980
Scott: I'm guessing like Pac Man iPhone or something afro samurai.

255
00:14:23,881 --> 00:14:24,825
Scott: Wow, they're not doing too.

256
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:25,146
Scott: Well.

257
00:14:25,387 --> 00:14:26,652
Scott: How many how many sales was it?

258
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:27,635
Rym: half a million?

259
00:14:27,655 --> 00:14:28,760
Scott: That's not good.

260
00:14:29,789 --> 00:14:30,860
Scott: I mean usually games.

261
00:14:30,961 --> 00:14:32,619
Scott: You know they need like a million sellers.

262
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:38,137
Rym: But third down on the list is Dragon Ball Z Attack of the Saiyans in Japan only on the DS.

263
00:14:38,819 --> 00:14:41,547
Scott: Wow That's and that was less than a half million.

264
00:14:41,567 --> 00:14:48,728
Rym: Yeah, and the other two big games were we ski and snowboard and we ski I Didn't even know there was were two different games.

265
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:49,331
Rym: No.

266
00:14:49,592 --> 00:14:51,863
Scott: I hope we ski is like free ski, though Then I'll buy it.

267
00:14:52,566 --> 00:14:55,600
Scott: Will you is there an abominable snowman who eats you at the bottom inevitably?

268
00:14:56,942 --> 00:14:59,345
Rym: You know he won't eat you if you're good You can.

269
00:14:59,486 --> 00:14:59,968
Scott: I've died.

270
00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:02,140
Scott: how many times have you dodged him in a row you know?

271
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:02,683
Rym: I don't even know.

272
00:15:02,743 --> 00:15:05,640
Rym: I just remember that I got that get way back when I didn't know how stuff worked.

273
00:15:06,282 --> 00:15:19,300
Rym: I basically thought games were free and then when I realized the games weren't free and my friends were just pirating them and giving me Copies yeah, I went to the store, and I bought what ended up being actually a bootleg collection that was sold semi legitimately.

274
00:15:20,482 --> 00:15:23,538
Scott: We actually had a legitimate Microsoft best of entertainment pack.

275
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:29,020
Rym: no I had this like 35 games pack that we bought at like electronics boutique got chat with chat.

276
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:30,899
Scott: I have a legitimate copy of chips challenge.

277
00:15:31,241 --> 00:15:35,916
Rym: I have a bootleg copy of chips challenge, and I bought at an EB, and you know what.

278
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:37,320
Scott: we can't possibly tell the difference.

279
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,288
Scott: It's just ones and zeros that are exactly the same.

280
00:15:39,308 --> 00:15:41,438
Rym: of course nothing ever be just ball.

281
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,080
Rym: no I just ball also legitimately But more and more we haven't talked about this.

282
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,410
Rym: I do want to bring it up at least a little bit that you know.

283
00:15:48,491 --> 00:15:56,469
Rym: the boy and his blob game is coming that the remake of a boy and his blob and It's looking more and more fantastic.

284
00:15:56,549 --> 00:15:57,974
Scott: Yeah, I've seen everything I've seen.

285
00:15:58,014 --> 00:15:58,636
Scott: if it tells me.

286
00:15:58,677 --> 00:16:02,043
Scott: That's the awesome win I mean it really looks like Co-op though.

287
00:16:02,063 --> 00:16:04,392
Scott: or one person can be the blob and one person can be the bull.

288
00:16:04,432 --> 00:16:13,977
Rym: all they did was take the concept and then Just fix every bad game academy because the boy in his blob was an unbeatable impossible Horrifying game back in the day.

289
00:16:13,997 --> 00:16:17,880
Scott: yeah But the idea of having a blob follow you and give it a jellybeans is a great idea.

290
00:16:18,201 --> 00:16:22,360
Rym: The only thing they kind of took away that I'm a little bit sad about is that they made the game cartoony and cute.

291
00:16:22,601 --> 00:16:24,878
Scott: They made it not more Indiana Jones like it used to be.

292
00:16:24,898 --> 00:16:25,722
Rym: well No, it's just.

293
00:16:25,762 --> 00:16:28,129
Scott: it used to be all Indiana Jones pitfall night.

294
00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:34,491
Rym: It's cool cool and cute, but the original styling of the game was Vaguely just disturbing and dark.

295
00:16:34,892 --> 00:16:36,760
Scott: We it was Indiana Jones pitfall.

296
00:16:37,342 --> 00:16:39,571
Rym: No, look at the graphic design of the original game.

297
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:40,354
Rym: It's just very.

298
00:16:40,414 --> 00:16:44,220
Rym: the whole thing was dark and absurd and kind of frightening.

299
00:16:45,821 --> 00:16:49,595
Rym: It was Indiana Jones and pitfall and you realize only a tiny bit of it was that.

300
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,000
Rym: and then the rest was our candy corn.

301
00:16:51,603 --> 00:16:53,033
Scott: Well the candy corn was something else.

302
00:16:53,234 --> 00:16:54,120
Rym: that was the real game.

303
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,637
Rym: The first part of the game was just get the treasure to buy the vitamins to get to the real game.

304
00:16:57,918 --> 00:17:02,533
Rym: Yeah That was that was it and I don't recall Indiana Jones swimming with bubbles.

305
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:05,625
Scott: He's fine with the barber spikes Within the snakes.

306
00:17:06,407 --> 00:17:07,392
Rym: there weren't so many snakes.

307
00:17:08,013 --> 00:17:08,536
Scott: Hey snakes.

308
00:17:08,837 --> 00:17:09,137
Rym: I know.

309
00:17:09,358 --> 00:17:13,289
Scott: okay Yeah, I'm looking forward to this and I'm actually hoping that we see.

310
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:13,569
Scott: you know.

311
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:19,499
Scott: firstly the body commando rearmed right which is basically a Remake of the original bionic commando.

312
00:17:19,781 --> 00:17:25,359
Scott: But this is taking an old concept and from a game that didn't have a lot of polish.

313
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,670
Scott: I'm so sad again with modern polish.

314
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:33,919
Rym: the original remake of the original game was great But the new game they made based on the concept the actual 3d bionic commando.

315
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,470
Rym: It was pretty weak sauce as far as anyone could tell.

316
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:38,097
Rym: it was just sold so poorly.

317
00:17:38,137 --> 00:17:38,820
Scott: No one's buying it.

318
00:17:39,345 --> 00:17:40,619
Rym: It was a terrible game.

319
00:17:40,802 --> 00:17:52,115
Rym: It is a terrible game But it says something for the game industry that if they just take is some old game That was known to be good or at least had a good concept and just remake it with modern technology But still make it a 2d.

320
00:17:52,640 --> 00:18:01,049
Scott: There are a lot of things out in this world right that only failed not just in video games But in general there are a lot of failures out there.

321
00:18:01,089 --> 00:18:08,160
Scott: that only failed because they lacked the necessary Surface polish and they have some valuable good meats on the inside.

322
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:09,003
Rym: What are you talking about?

323
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,706
Rym: the bionic commando?

324
00:18:09,726 --> 00:18:11,653
Rym: that game was hugely popular in the u.s..

325
00:18:12,235 --> 00:18:18,407
Scott: Well, I'm not talking about bionic commando I'm just talking about the remake of that, but you know You know the boy in his blob right.

326
00:18:18,427 --> 00:18:21,597
Rym: they took these old good night game was actually also pretty popular.

327
00:18:21,638 --> 00:18:23,268
Rym: as far as I recall It sold really well.

328
00:18:23,288 --> 00:18:24,659
Scott: I don't know how well it sold.

329
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:30,296
Rym: Anyway consider how much of an enduring legacy it has that people remembered that game and talked about it.

330
00:18:30,517 --> 00:18:31,580
Scott: people remember a lot of things.

331
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,987
Rym: It didn't sell at all So but they remember it and liked it.

332
00:18:34,047 --> 00:18:36,740
Scott: plus people remember Zelda CDI just as much as they remember.

333
00:18:36,901 --> 00:18:42,883
Rym: Actually as far as I can tell the vast majority of people didn't even know Zelda CDI Existed.

334
00:18:42,923 --> 00:18:44,672
Scott: the vast majority of people don't even know.

335
00:18:44,733 --> 00:18:48,340
Scott: the point is blob exists now But I think game you don't even know earthbound exists.

336
00:18:48,481 --> 00:18:52,540
Rym: I think gamers more knew more about earth down in a boy in his blob than they did about the Zelda games.

337
00:18:54,581 --> 00:18:55,243
Scott: It's hard to tell.

338
00:18:55,323 --> 00:18:55,644
Scott: anyway.

339
00:18:55,684 --> 00:19:02,282
Scott: the point is is that I hope there are more remakes of old good yet unpolished Game.

340
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:09,551
Rym: I point out that there was basically zero buzz about the CDI games on the internet Until the AVGN covered them.

341
00:19:09,832 --> 00:19:10,918
Scott: no he wasn't.

342
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,370
Scott: There were buzz about them way before.

343
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:16,324
Rym: he covered them occasional tiny buzz But it never got out there.

344
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:17,167
Rym: most people didn't know.

345
00:19:17,368 --> 00:19:22,500
Rym: hardly anyone in our friend group had ever heard of these games and our friends Are gamers and I knew about them for so long.

346
00:19:22,562 --> 00:19:26,113
Rym: Yes But everyone knew boy is blob and everyone knew bionic man.

347
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:27,980
Scott: the point is is a ton of games out there.

348
00:19:28,181 --> 00:19:30,448
Scott: I can come up with a whole bunch like monster party.

349
00:19:30,468 --> 00:19:32,655
Rym: I wasn't a game monster party.

350
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,157
Scott: Oh come on.

351
00:19:33,177 --> 00:19:34,421
Rym: That was a terrible game Dr..

352
00:19:34,461 --> 00:19:37,291
Scott: Chaos, okay silver surfer terrible game.

353
00:19:37,371 --> 00:19:42,129
Scott: right these games if they just repolish them They'd be great silver surfer.

354
00:19:42,149 --> 00:19:43,697
Rym: That's just saying make a shmup.

355
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:45,485
Scott: now It's got to be the silver surfer.

356
00:19:45,545 --> 00:19:46,770
Rym: why the core concept?

357
00:19:47,292 --> 00:19:49,039
Rym: silver surfer is better off not being a shmup?

358
00:19:49,401 --> 00:19:51,450
Scott: No, it's better the silver surfer has got to be a shmup.

359
00:19:51,711 --> 00:19:52,394
Scott: What else could it be?

360
00:19:52,897 --> 00:19:56,774
Rym: besides you're forgetting There's only one game that really needs to be remade other than tie fighter.

361
00:19:56,795 --> 00:20:00,472
Rym: There's an already being remade Well actually and that is metal marines for the s.

362
00:20:00,512 --> 00:20:02,120
Scott: Oh metal marines the other good choice?

363
00:20:02,984 --> 00:20:06,723
Scott: No, actually you know lucas arts is starting to do a lot of remakes They're doing.

364
00:20:06,743 --> 00:20:09,239
Scott: they did the monkey island doing some other action, right?

365
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:17,620
Scott: Somebody asked them about the tie fighter and the x-wing and the lucas arts person said I can't say anything yet.

366
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:20,813
Scott: Just wait dot dot dot something something.

367
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:23,483
Scott: maybe the problem is that wink nudge That is all.

368
00:20:23,603 --> 00:20:31,892
Rym: that is equally code in marketing for we have something, but we can't announce it yet, and We haven't done anything, but we're pretending.

369
00:20:31,932 --> 00:20:33,539
Rym: We might have to gauge interests.

370
00:20:34,763 --> 00:20:36,318
Rym: Either way is good by me.

371
00:20:37,082 --> 00:20:38,246
Rym: I don't know how much interest there is.

372
00:20:38,306 --> 00:20:45,855
Rym: it's a chicken and egg situation where there's there's just now that flight stick Which is weird because that basically a coincidence.

373
00:20:45,956 --> 00:20:47,704
Rym: a chicken appears Conspiracy.

374
00:20:47,885 --> 00:20:49,654
Rym: a chicken appeared, but there was no eggs.

375
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:50,719
Rym: suddenly there was a chicken.

376
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,700
Scott: There's a but there's a chicken and there's a wink for an egg.

377
00:20:53,720 --> 00:21:01,351
Scott: There's a wink and a nod suggesting that there's the hens gonna lay an egg Which is which is more than we've had in since.

378
00:21:01,472 --> 00:21:01,732
Scott: Lizzie.

379
00:21:01,772 --> 00:21:04,260
Scott: when did tie fighter come out over a decade?

380
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:08,732
Rym: No, there was x-wing alliance was it was a fantastic come out.

381
00:21:08,853 --> 00:21:19,640
Rym: I don't even know but after tie fighter And to be a long time ago and after x-wing versus tie fighter, which I can only describe in one word abortion.

382
00:21:21,204 --> 00:21:29,671
Scott: It doesn't matter I have Actually, I don't really care because even if this game comes out by the time it comes out I'll just be playing ns2, and we'll give a shit.

383
00:21:29,811 --> 00:21:31,199
Rym: That's the only game that matters right?

384
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:31,400
Scott: so?

385
00:21:38,092 --> 00:21:39,863
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

386
00:21:39,884 --> 00:21:40,588
Rym: What do you got for me?

387
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:43,158
Scott: So you know people like to do versus right.

388
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:43,720
Scott: they do like.

389
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,243
Scott: I don't know.

390
00:21:44,604 --> 00:21:47,996
Rym: Voltron versus Messenger like a fanboy.

391
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:50,725
Scott: see Star Wars very Star Trek or Superman vs.

392
00:21:50,745 --> 00:21:52,210
Rym: Batman right all right.

393
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,938
Scott: Are you ready for the ultimate versus?

394
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:56,430
Rym: I've already seen Megaman versus Donkey Kong.

395
00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:00,467
Scott: Henry Rollins all right versus techno.

396
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:04,857
Rym: Viking Rollins Definitely Rollins.

397
00:22:04,998 --> 00:22:07,170
Scott: well no, but there's basically this is video.

398
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:11,400
Scott: They mashed up Rollins complaining about techno music and techno Viking.

399
00:22:11,441 --> 00:22:20,989
Scott: they took the two videos and put them together in a funny way in fact in a way that creates a techno song And I enjoy this very much.

400
00:22:21,815 --> 00:22:24,030
Scott: So I hope you enjoy it very much.

401
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:24,953
Rym: So who would win then?

402
00:22:25,314 --> 00:22:29,730
Rym: Rollins in a Cosby sweater or Bruce Campbell in a Cosby sweater?

403
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:31,378
Scott: What's what's the competition?

404
00:22:31,438 --> 00:22:33,290
Scott: I mean is it chess chess boxing?

405
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:39,175
Rym: shooting eating Puddin pops Puddin pops We'll talk about.

406
00:22:39,216 --> 00:22:42,530
Scott: we know that when you wear a Cosby sweater you have infinite Puddin pop eating powers.

407
00:22:43,531 --> 00:22:48,710
Rym: We'll talk about that on a Thursday, but suffice it to say Cosby sweaters were a big part of a ConnectiCon.

408
00:22:49,914 --> 00:22:58,269
Rym: So oh yeah You know in old Cartoons when like there'd be a mouse or something talking really quickly like in Tom and Jerry and everything

409
00:23:00,113 --> 00:23:05,176
Scott: Or in like peanuts or like the teacher Particularly

410
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:12,915
Rym: with Chip and Dale and Apparently with Popeye all they would do is get someone to say something and then speed it up And then use that as the audio.

411
00:23:13,496 --> 00:23:14,600
Scott: well good idea.

412
00:23:14,921 --> 00:23:23,110
Rym: one thing you can do that is very clever because you know the way audio works Is slow it down, and you can hear what they're actually saying and usually it's something lame.

413
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:26,421
Rym: But what I have here from College Humor is a gem.

414
00:23:26,983 --> 00:23:29,733
Rym: This is a 1952 Popeye Shut-eye.

415
00:23:29,773 --> 00:23:30,455
Rym: Popeye.

416
00:23:30,856 --> 00:23:31,959
Rym: Popeye is trying to sleep.

417
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:33,263
Scott: I like me some Popeye.

418
00:23:33,303 --> 00:23:35,470
Scott: I was actually thinking about getting this Popeye box set.

419
00:23:35,611 --> 00:23:38,570
Rym: I only like the old racist black-and-white Popeye.

420
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:40,676
Scott: What are the Popeye would you watch?

421
00:23:40,837 --> 00:23:41,960
Rym: like Popeye Aladdin?

422
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,424
Rym: just him basically be.

423
00:23:44,066 --> 00:23:45,470
Scott: what other kind of Popeye is there?

424
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:58,795
Rym: It's just this scary saddled sailor with Tourette's beating people up exactly, but Popeye He's trying to sleep in his garbage can And the mouse.

425
00:23:58,835 --> 00:24:01,025
Rym: you know the mouse wants to sleep and Popeye snores.

426
00:24:01,045 --> 00:24:01,869
Rym: the mouse yells at him.

427
00:24:02,391 --> 00:24:10,328
Rym: But if you slow it down it as far as I can tell it's this voice actor saying Yeah, give me some lines to say I can't really read this goddamn.

428
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:16,148
Rym: Whatever No, it's just some guy saying that kind of pissed off, and that's the audio they used.

429
00:24:16,209 --> 00:24:19,604
Rym: apparently Maybe they got some bum off the street handed him a script.

430
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:20,227
Rym: That was it.

431
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:25,972
Scott: Yeah, that's pretty interesting though to like uncover like these hidden data It's sort of like.

432
00:24:25,992 --> 00:24:26,916
Scott: remember how they were.

433
00:24:26,976 --> 00:24:38,616
Rym: you know what it's sort of like the that infamous picture on eBay of someone selling a teapot and in the reflection of the teapot if you use a Photoshop filter to Deprospective it from the teapot surface.

434
00:24:39,017 --> 00:24:40,683
Rym: There's a naked guy holding a camera.

435
00:24:41,044 --> 00:24:41,265
Scott: Yep.

436
00:24:41,666 --> 00:24:41,867
Scott: Well.

437
00:24:41,907 --> 00:24:42,830
Scott: No it's sort of like.

438
00:24:43,211 --> 00:24:44,756
Scott: Remember they were doing those studies.

439
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:51,541
Scott: or if you take old pottery and sort of run like a record needle across it You know because of the pseudoscience mostly Scott.

440
00:24:51,702 --> 00:24:53,750
Rym: I know almost entirely pseudoscience.

441
00:24:53,871 --> 00:24:56,745
Rym: I don't think anyone legitimate has ever read anything into that.

442
00:24:57,006 --> 00:25:03,145
Rym: I know but Like it's like the same idea it is except one idea is made up and one idea works.

443
00:25:03,426 --> 00:25:04,570
Scott: Yeah, that's the same idea?

444
00:25:05,235 --> 00:25:10,900
Scott: Yeah, yeah, that's it alright, so We got to do a show on gaming.

445
00:25:10,921 --> 00:25:12,810
Scott: No one's been playing any video games.

446
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:14,901
Scott: We definitely haven't been playing the same video games.

447
00:25:14,961 --> 00:25:27,779
Scott: I mean, I don't think you played any blood Bowl, but Despite being at Connecticut and basically you know running 20 like 38 hours worth of panels We did manage to play one board game.

448
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:29,203
Rym: we played two games.

449
00:25:29,504 --> 00:25:31,409
Rym: we played one all right.

450
00:25:31,469 --> 00:25:32,998
Scott: wow We should talk about you once about both of them.

451
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:34,124
Scott: I forgot about the other one.

452
00:25:34,185 --> 00:25:36,054
Rym: we played well We played the sword.

453
00:25:36,074 --> 00:25:37,158
Rym: well, okay.

454
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,924
Scott: Yeah, that's not a board game.

455
00:25:39,265 --> 00:25:39,968
Rym: I didn't say board game.

456
00:25:40,008 --> 00:25:40,510
Rym: I said game.

457
00:25:40,653 --> 00:25:41,250
Scott: Yeah, that's true.

458
00:25:41,451 --> 00:25:47,387
Rym: We played the sword and pretty epically mostly because I won and you lost your strategy that you've been telling me.

459
00:25:47,668 --> 00:25:50,798
Scott: basically Scott I didn't get to use the full extent of my strategy.

460
00:25:50,818 --> 00:25:54,130
Rym: Scott told me this strategy a long long long time ago.

461
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:55,135
Rym: He's like I can win the sword.

462
00:25:55,155 --> 00:25:57,850
Rym: I just have to be the elf and I punked him as the rat.

463
00:25:58,771 --> 00:25:59,254
Scott: That's all right.

464
00:25:59,677 --> 00:26:03,621
Rym: partly because Luke crane told me how to win as the rat I just did exactly what he said and do anything.

465
00:26:03,641 --> 00:26:09,802
Rym: you just sat there while I got stabbed Basically, I took whoever's side was winning at all and I waited until everyone was.

466
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:10,484
Rym: I made a.

467
00:26:10,645 --> 00:26:17,162
Scott: I made one flaw in In in trying to appeal to you and not appealing to the human.

468
00:26:17,182 --> 00:26:19,610
Rym: I paid me, so I didn't give a shit anymore.

469
00:26:20,172 --> 00:26:22,963
Scott: Yeah, but I had to get you out of the way so that the only one.

470
00:26:23,003 --> 00:26:30,862
Scott: cuz if I if I can't get at The team no no no no no strong against the door, but the rat is in the way I have to move the rat aside to get the door.

471
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:31,083
Rym: No.

472
00:26:31,124 --> 00:26:32,169
Rym: There's a better way.

473
00:26:32,653 --> 00:26:33,679
Rym: Uh-huh tell the dwarf.

474
00:26:33,699 --> 00:26:34,465
Rym: You know what fine.

475
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:35,189
Rym: You can have it.

476
00:26:35,551 --> 00:26:36,918
Rym: I give up my claim to the sword.

477
00:26:37,239 --> 00:26:39,430
Rym: let him and the rat fight and then take the sword.

478
00:26:40,253 --> 00:26:41,303
Scott: Yeah, it's not so good.

479
00:26:41,323 --> 00:26:43,354
Rym: That'll work Every time.

480
00:26:43,415 --> 00:26:44,839
Scott: no because the elf has the.

481
00:26:45,481 --> 00:26:46,906
Scott: you know when someone is hurt.

482
00:26:47,006 --> 00:26:47,949
Scott: You know sue them.

483
00:26:48,191 --> 00:26:50,348
Rym: Yes, sue them with a sword.

484
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,701
Scott: I don't know how soothing the sword is anyway.

485
00:26:54,023 --> 00:26:55,270
Scott: We did play two board games.

486
00:26:55,371 --> 00:26:56,461
Scott: I got both or just one.

487
00:26:56,482 --> 00:27:01,410
Rym: talk about both But we should talk about hacienda in a little bit of depth though the thing is it's a board game.

488
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:02,697
Rym: That's simple enough to where.

489
00:27:02,737 --> 00:27:03,823
Rym: don't have a lot to say about it.

490
00:27:03,863 --> 00:27:05,029
Rym: Just it's a good game right.

491
00:27:05,069 --> 00:27:08,121
Scott: well Hacienda, let's talk about that first cuz it's fresh in the mind right.

492
00:27:08,281 --> 00:27:13,270
Scott: I knew how to play hacienda from back in the day because of the website spiel by web.com.

493
00:27:13,511 --> 00:27:16,499
Scott: S-P-I-E-L-B-Y-W-E-B.com.

494
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:22,296
Scott: you know you can play by web in German where you can play Hacienda online for free.

495
00:27:22,336 --> 00:27:28,770
Scott: and they have a bunch of other games too like reef encounter and Santiago which I don't know how to play and a few others.

496
00:27:28,971 --> 00:27:34,709
Scott: I'm an ray right which I do know how to play and I used to go on this website a whole bunch and I'd always Be playing it back in the day.

497
00:27:35,272 --> 00:27:39,410
Scott: But I sort of stopped after a while just because they didn't add me new games, and I was sort of eh.

498
00:27:40,251 --> 00:27:43,250
Scott: But then I knew that you know Rym never played these games.

499
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:46,510
Scott: You know pretty much no one else, but me had ever gone to spiel by web and played there.

500
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,810
Scott: I think Alex might have anyway.

501
00:27:48,796 --> 00:27:53,950
Scott: We were at Connecticut and we finally had a chance to play a board game, and I saw Hacienda there, and I was like all right.

502
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:57,821
Scott: Actually, that's a great choice because I kind of know how to play.

503
00:27:58,463 --> 00:28:09,438
Scott: and the thing is when you're at a convention like this If you pick up a board game You've never played before and you're good to take like two hours or an hour just to read the rules and figure it out And set it up and teach everyone how to play.

504
00:28:09,458 --> 00:28:12,450
Scott: and you don't have a lot of time at a convention time is you know?

505
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:13,012
Scott: Precious.

506
00:28:13,555 --> 00:28:18,579
Scott: so a game that I knew how to play from playing it online already And I only had to review the rules quickly.

507
00:28:19,082 --> 00:28:20,970
Scott: that was a very good choice.

508
00:28:21,131 --> 00:28:26,110
Scott: So we played Hacienda and then me and Rym started an online game of Hacienda today.

509
00:28:26,733 --> 00:28:28,624
Rym: So Hacienda is pretty much this game it up.

510
00:28:28,925 --> 00:28:32,361
Scott: it has a theme nominally of the theme is not a it doesn't go.

511
00:28:32,421 --> 00:28:51,257
Rym: so it has a theme nominally of Haciendas basically out in the prairie build you know taking land getting the famous giant bone getting animals out in the land Driving them to the market, but the game mechanics backing up this theme are so So shallow pretty much.

512
00:28:51,297 --> 00:28:53,021
Scott: the game is a combination of two things.

513
00:28:53,082 --> 00:28:53,683
Scott: number one.

514
00:28:53,824 --> 00:28:56,230
Scott: It's Tron like through the desert right.

515
00:28:56,331 --> 00:29:03,024
Scott: It's that game plus Resource management sort of like to call where you have action points and also resources.

516
00:29:03,084 --> 00:29:05,090
Scott: right and that is Hacienda.

517
00:29:05,311 --> 00:29:19,313
Scott: It's all you do is you have resources you have every turn you have three actions and you have money and you have cards and you can buy cards the money gets turned into cards cards turn into stuff stuff turns into money and Victory points.

518
00:29:19,795 --> 00:29:24,289
Scott: and then you use the money to buy more cards to get more stuff to get more money and victory points.

519
00:29:24,349 --> 00:29:28,002
Scott: and you Get this cycle going on and the stuff goes on the board.

520
00:29:28,022 --> 00:29:31,635
Scott: and when you put the stuff on the board you try to put It out Tron style.

521
00:29:31,655 --> 00:29:40,030
Scott: you're blocking the other guy off and surrounding things And you know you're trying to get really good layouts to to get in the other guy's way.

522
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:47,934
Scott: You're competing over the territories to get you know big long strings of land or strings of Animals and herds.

523
00:29:48,275 --> 00:29:49,619
Scott: you know that without getting them blocked.

524
00:29:49,699 --> 00:29:50,641
Scott: It's longer the better.

525
00:29:50,982 --> 00:29:53,610
Rym: It's a game of getting you know physical combos.

526
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:57,223
Rym: There's restrictions where you can put stuff, so it's it's through the desert.

527
00:29:57,484 --> 00:30:03,507
Rym: Which is camel Tron, but with Almost less of a theme, but more mechanics to beef it up.

528
00:30:03,849 --> 00:30:07,813
Scott: Yep The thing about this game I sort of it's.

529
00:30:07,913 --> 00:30:10,422
Scott: it's sort of weird because it's like the the.

530
00:30:10,502 --> 00:30:12,067
Scott: it's not that complicated right?

531
00:30:12,087 --> 00:30:16,844
Scott: you look at like a lot more Complex games like Puerto Rico's more complicated teeny right.

532
00:30:17,185 --> 00:30:18,490
Scott: this really isn't that complex.

533
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:21,390
Scott: It's in fact is less complex than even like El Grande.

534
00:30:22,133 --> 00:30:34,338
Scott: Maybe I'd say it's slightly more complex than Carcassonne right yet You know it's also so straightforward, and it's pretty much get action points Spend you know get stuff.

535
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,911
Scott: It's just your decisions are so Distinct.

536
00:30:38,573 --> 00:30:41,723
Scott: you think oh, I should be able to solve this and just have a perfect play.

537
00:30:41,964 --> 00:30:43,870
Scott: right, but it's actually for some.

538
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:44,593
Scott: You know it's it's.

539
00:30:44,834 --> 00:30:46,380
Scott: it's not easy to get a perfect play.

540
00:30:46,581 --> 00:30:46,943
Rym: well now.

541
00:30:47,023 --> 00:30:50,062
Rym: I would disagree that in a vacuum It's kind of like it's an Agricola.

542
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:50,870
Rym: sit in a vacuum.

543
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:52,093
Rym: Yes, well as in.

544
00:30:52,194 --> 00:31:01,367
Rym: it's the same thing with Agricola where the first couple of plays you're figuring out kind of the optimal means of Generating victory points the optimal means of controlling things you need to control.

545
00:31:01,427 --> 00:31:06,263
Rym: but Much like an Agricola the real game is not making the factory work.

546
00:31:06,584 --> 00:31:08,650
Rym: the factory working is the trivial solution.

547
00:31:09,172 --> 00:31:16,221
Rym: The problem is interacting with the other players such that you get what you need and you can make your machine work within the construct Of their machines.

548
00:31:16,281 --> 00:31:26,890
Scott: that's one thing I think is very good about this game is that there are multiple ways to get victory points and they balance each other out quite Nicely like let's say you try to connect to a bunch of different markets.

549
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:29,097
Scott: that's one way to get a lot of victory points right.

550
00:31:29,518 --> 00:31:40,779
Scott: if you're cut off from that you can still get just as much points doing say haciendas or water or strings of land Or any of the other victory point.

551
00:31:40,819 --> 00:31:47,242
Scott: machines are equally fruitful if you milk them enough And you can never milk all of them equally unless it's like a two-player game.

552
00:31:47,263 --> 00:31:52,723
Scott: There's basically no fighting over resources whatsoever In a three four or five player game.

553
00:31:52,863 --> 00:31:54,090
Scott: It's two to five right.

554
00:31:54,271 --> 00:32:01,190
Scott: there's a lot more competition for the resources on the map and You're not gonna be able to get the victory points in all the different categories.

555
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:07,527
Scott: So you're just gonna have to pick a few of them and go all out and it's a good idea To go for ones that other people are not going for.

556
00:32:07,607 --> 00:32:08,672
Scott: so there's less Competition.

557
00:32:09,255 --> 00:32:15,152
Scott: if you try to go for a big string of land and someone else is going for a big string of land Good luck with that You know.

558
00:32:15,192 --> 00:32:24,200
Scott: if you try to go for you know just connect to a lot of different Markets all over the place and someone else goes for a string of land You're probably both gonna be able to make it happen.

559
00:32:24,341 --> 00:32:29,002
Rym: kind of the two-player game is fun And it definitely won't run out on us now.

560
00:32:29,022 --> 00:32:31,854
Rym: We're playing it halfway through and it's a pretty Even match.

561
00:32:31,874 --> 00:32:37,032
Rym: we're both using different strategies, but I'm enjoying it, but it has the same I don't know.

562
00:32:37,433 --> 00:32:43,076
Rym: little effort needed to jump in and play not that much setup and yet Enough variation.

563
00:32:43,096 --> 00:32:44,281
Rym: the two-player doesn't get stagnant.

564
00:32:44,301 --> 00:32:46,510
Rym: that I think it's the same reason I like tempest so much.

565
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,005
Rym: I can just sit down and play tempest.

566
00:32:48,288 --> 00:32:51,283
Scott: yep It's also another game where you can vary the map a lot.

567
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:53,774
Scott: the default map is the dog bone But you can.

568
00:32:53,794 --> 00:32:58,702
Scott: there's a map on the reverse side and if you play online There's a ton of maps you can play on.

569
00:32:58,742 --> 00:33:08,350
Scott: I'm sure some of them are stupid But you know in case you really do get bored with the bone map and you sort of figure it out You can try all sorts of different stuff which might be a lot more interesting.

570
00:33:09,052 --> 00:33:10,336
Scott: You know at least to mix it up some.

571
00:33:10,858 --> 00:33:21,337
Scott: the other thing is the game does have that sort of lots of little decisions Mechanic the same thing that ticket to ride has where instead of people having very long turns We do a lot of things.

572
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,250
Scott: everyone has little tiny turns.

573
00:33:23,571 --> 00:33:32,479
Scott: So you're always doing something and you're always making very small decisions that all add up to each add up in the long run Which makes for you know a more fun play.

574
00:33:32,579 --> 00:33:35,087
Scott: as you know it's your turn more often.

575
00:33:35,368 --> 00:33:39,025
Scott: turns are quick You don't have to think about a whole lot to get your turn done.

576
00:33:39,266 --> 00:33:40,010
Scott: people bevagon.

577
00:33:40,171 --> 00:33:44,729
Rym: Well it has a very important, you know it has that I love the mechanic the end of a gun.

578
00:33:44,769 --> 00:33:47,570
Rym: sorry Yeah, it has two really cool mechanics.

579
00:33:47,710 --> 00:34:00,450
Rym: One is the end decker of risk management and that you can basically always you'll buy a known Animal or a known land like a known card for one amount of money or buy one unknown from the top of the stack.

580
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:02,398
Scott: Well, yeah, that's the same thing.

581
00:34:02,438 --> 00:34:05,190
Scott: you see and take it to ride and also turn in taxes.

582
00:34:05,371 --> 00:34:05,913
Scott: Right is the?

583
00:34:06,013 --> 00:34:10,690
Scott: is the the draft where there are face-up cards and also you can also get the face-down card.

584
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:14,125
Scott: So it's like do you want to get the face-up card and know what you're getting?

585
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:14,908
Scott: or do you want to?

586
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:18,545
Scott: Risk it and get the face-down card in which case you don't know what kind you're gonna get.

587
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:19,650
Rym: it's a great mechanic.

588
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:20,638
Rym: I just I love it.

589
00:34:20,819 --> 00:34:21,947
Rym: I absolutely love it.

590
00:34:22,373 --> 00:34:23,510
Scott: It's really I think a lot.

591
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:28,996
Scott: I think you know a lot of other games that have draw from card We can't draw from a deck.

592
00:34:29,158 --> 00:34:31,270
Scott: mechanics would do well to incorporate this.

593
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:31,773
Scott: I mean magic.

594
00:34:31,813 --> 00:34:34,369
Scott: the gathering would even do well to incorporate something like this.

595
00:34:34,992 --> 00:34:36,819
Scott: You know, but you know, that's never gonna happen.

596
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,730
Rym: And the other part is has a really cool ebb and flow.

597
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:43,062
Rym: It's that that's something that actually isn't in a lot of games and it's not.

598
00:34:43,523 --> 00:34:43,864
Rym: it's almost.

599
00:34:43,905 --> 00:34:49,684
Rym: it's not really a mechanism design thing It's just the way the rules will the way people will play will come.

600
00:34:49,945 --> 00:34:58,399
Rym: you can move between Building victory points or building money or something like that where you have two or three different directions to go but going in any one direction.

601
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,164
Rym: the more you go in.

602
00:34:59,224 --> 00:35:04,270
Rym: it kind of Forces you to need the thing in the opposite direction more and more and more and more.

603
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:06,806
Scott: Yeah It's like if you start building a ton of stuff right.

604
00:35:06,887 --> 00:35:11,030
Scott: first of all You want to build faster than the other people because you're fighting over this territory.

605
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:13,570
Rym: But you can't build faster than you run out of cards.

606
00:35:14,053 --> 00:35:16,090
Rym: No, because everyone has the same constraint.

607
00:35:16,171 --> 00:35:23,270
Rym: So no matter how much you pull in one direction You can't get ahead in an absolute sense not counting victory points of anyone else.

608
00:35:23,571 --> 00:35:25,679
Rym: It's just a matter of when do you build?

609
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,823
Rym: when do you save?

610
00:35:26,963 --> 00:35:28,147
Rym: when do you harvest all the?

611
00:35:28,208 --> 00:35:28,850
Rym: it's all the way.

612
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:33,090
Scott: You got to build before the other people but if you build before then you run out of cards.

613
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:34,763
Scott: That means you're gonna be you know one.

614
00:35:34,803 --> 00:35:39,550
Scott: you'll be like, yeah Yeah, yeah, you're building stuff and you're like surrounding something the other guys getting blocked off.

615
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:40,597
Scott: You're like fuck you I win.

616
00:35:40,617 --> 00:35:42,690
Scott: Yeah, and then you run out of cards.

617
00:35:43,011 --> 00:35:48,938
Scott: So you spend a few turns spending your money to buy some cards and during those turns The other guy starts playing all the cards.

618
00:35:48,979 --> 00:35:50,304
Scott: He was buying when you were building.

619
00:35:50,325 --> 00:35:54,710
Scott: You're like no no, no No, no, no, and then he runs out of cards.

620
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:58,049
Scott: You start building with the cards you just bought and it goes back and forth like that.

621
00:35:58,671 --> 00:36:02,644
Scott: Sometimes you're building at the same time and sometimes you're mixing up the building.

622
00:36:02,664 --> 00:36:04,670
Rym: Well, that's especially with the three and four player game.

623
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:07,390
Rym: It's the ebb and flow of knowing when to capitalize.

624
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:11,228
Rym: It adds a lot of tactical elements to the game that would otherwise be lacking.

625
00:36:11,409 --> 00:36:18,950
Scott: one thing I definitely learned though is you don't want to do like, you know, I mean you think okay Why don't I just every turn buy a little bit and build a little bit?

626
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:29,665
Scott: well Because then sometimes you need to build like two or three things at a time in order to get a lock and if you build One piece of land then the other guy knows where you're going and he'll cut you off over there.

627
00:36:29,706 --> 00:36:31,834
Scott: and now you wasted that build Right where.

628
00:36:31,854 --> 00:36:39,989
Scott: if you would have built land animal animal you would have gotten your mood You would have gotten in there all at once and you wouldn't have foreshadowed your move before you executed it.

629
00:36:40,471 --> 00:36:43,066
Scott: So it's sort of the game sort of forces you to.

630
00:36:43,086 --> 00:36:48,050
Scott: you know Do the big moves instead of doing lots of little ones in terms of building?

631
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:49,393
Scott: So you tend to.

632
00:36:49,514 --> 00:36:56,409
Scott: you tend to do lots of similar actions, you know, bye-bye-bye build build build take card Take card take card all at once.

633
00:36:57,312 --> 00:36:58,215
Rym: I also really like.

634
00:36:58,235 --> 00:37:07,099
Rym: I like the fact that you have all these different mechanisms to get money and mechanisms to get victory points and They feel like unfair combos the first time you play.

635
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:13,890
Rym: like you look at how scoring works to get money from animals And you think well, what if I just like build all the way around that market?

636
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:17,063
Rym: I'll score it every time but everything in the game is like that.

637
00:37:17,243 --> 00:37:17,464
Scott: Yep.

638
00:37:17,906 --> 00:37:22,723
Scott: The other thing is that You know, it's I forgot what I was gonna say, right?

639
00:37:22,964 --> 00:37:23,205
Rym: All right.

640
00:37:23,225 --> 00:37:24,109
Rym: Well here are two other things.

641
00:37:24,249 --> 00:37:32,290
Rym: one Most games, you know older German games tended to have these scoring rounds mechanic as opposed to continuous I was gonna say or in-game scoring.

642
00:37:32,852 --> 00:37:38,110
Rym: Like I remember Al Grande had the neat you go turn turn scoring around turn turn scoring around turn turn scoring around.

643
00:37:38,992 --> 00:37:43,039
Rym: This is basically the college class Semester version of that.

644
00:37:43,381 --> 00:37:48,966
Rym: there are two scoring rounds Once when the animal deck is depleted the first time and once when the animal deck is depleted the second.

645
00:37:48,986 --> 00:37:52,560
Scott: you basically cut the animal Deck in half and when it runs out you score.

646
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:56,460
Scott: and when it runs out again you score on the game's over and you score The same way both times.

647
00:37:56,843 --> 00:37:57,247
Rym: It's amazing.

648
00:37:57,891 --> 00:38:04,682
Rym: You have to either I just count how many victory points I have and how many victory points the other person has Every round and just keep it in my head.

649
00:38:04,903 --> 00:38:08,120
Rym: Yep, but You have to be ready.

650
00:38:08,201 --> 00:38:09,510
Rym: Like right now we're playing the game.

651
00:38:09,792 --> 00:38:11,609
Rym: There are four animal cards left in the deck.

652
00:38:12,392 --> 00:38:17,906
Rym: If anyone buys an animal card, the other person has the ability to force scoring immediately.

653
00:38:17,926 --> 00:38:23,970
Rym: Yep, and The ebb and that's why I did not buy an animal card my last turn because I want to leave it at four.

654
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:28,489
Rym: We're in an interesting situation to where Scott has no cards left at all.

655
00:38:28,911 --> 00:38:30,097
Rym: None, no animals.

656
00:38:30,197 --> 00:38:31,785
Scott: No thing, but I have a shit ton of money.

657
00:38:31,865 --> 00:38:34,339
Rym: you do so you can buy stuff But then I can force the scoring ground.

658
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,010
Rym: Yep, and I go second.

659
00:38:36,332 --> 00:38:38,530
Rym: So as soon as I force it you don't get to do anything.

660
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:42,433
Scott: The thing is instead of you know buying cards on my turn I can buy water.

661
00:38:43,316 --> 00:38:46,447
Rym: You can buy water, but I can buy animals.

662
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:50,862
Scott: That's true Anyway, so yeah, the thing is with this game right is?

663
00:38:50,902 --> 00:38:52,850
Scott: it's sort of easy to get a lot of money?

664
00:38:53,413 --> 00:38:56,730
Scott: Right, but getting a lot of money doesn't necessarily get you a lot of victory points.

665
00:38:56,730 --> 00:39:04,570
Scott: Like you could just surround a market with animals and you get a pile of money But you won't really get a lot of victory points for that because it's only one market.

666
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:06,355
Rym: Well, here's the unique part of this game.

667
00:39:06,897 --> 00:39:11,170
Rym: It is possible to remove yourself effectively from the game.

668
00:39:11,372 --> 00:39:12,746
Rym: Yeah, it is also it.

669
00:39:12,948 --> 00:39:14,115
Rym: well Here's an example.

670
00:39:14,155 --> 00:39:21,030
Rym: you can basically if you are stupid or if you're trying Put yourself in a situation where you don't have enough money to buy any cards.

671
00:39:21,433 --> 00:39:31,281
Rym: You have already played all of your cards And you cannot use any of the existing mechanics in the game to get any more money Mm-hmm, and there there's no way in the rules to recover from that.

672
00:39:31,683 --> 00:39:32,827
Scott: not that I know of there's.

673
00:39:33,268 --> 00:39:33,830
Rym: I read the rules.

674
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:34,738
Rym: There's no way to recover.

675
00:39:34,758 --> 00:39:36,090
Rym: It's just you're done.

676
00:39:36,673 --> 00:39:37,197
Scott: The other thing.

677
00:39:37,237 --> 00:39:39,290
Rym: I think rare to see a game like that like in Puerto Rico.

678
00:39:39,932 --> 00:39:44,209
Rym: There is no way to make yourself 100% destitute because there's the prospector.

679
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:46,738
Rym: Yes, there isn't even a prospector.

680
00:39:46,758 --> 00:39:50,550
Rym: if you've harvested you're like one plantation and then you spend all that money.

681
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:57,097
Scott: Even if you're playing Puerto Rico without a prospector the balloons will pile up on the thing nobody wants and you can take that thing.

682
00:39:57,117 --> 00:39:57,478
Scott: the

683
00:39:57,498 --> 00:40:13,450
Rym: thing is it's interesting that this trap is here because it's the equivalent of the Platform that you can't jump off of in a Mario game where the only way off is to wait for the time it'll run out Or to jump in the pit Mmm, and usually that is the hallmark of poorly thought-out design.

684
00:40:13,571 --> 00:40:17,610
Rym: I wonder if they anticipated it or they just assume that no one would be stupid enough to do it.

685
00:40:17,717 --> 00:40:23,757
Scott: I mean It's so easy to get money and they start you off with so many so much stuff That it's kind of it's.

686
00:40:23,898 --> 00:40:25,385
Scott: it's kind of hard for it to ever happen.

687
00:40:25,466 --> 00:40:26,310
Scott: It's you're really dumb.

688
00:40:26,431 --> 00:40:29,449
Rym: It's trivial if you go for it, though It is true that you go for it.

689
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,170
Rym: You can go for it and just be out of the game.

690
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:37,575
Scott: the other thing about the game though, is that it's trivial to get money right but It's you.

691
00:40:37,716 --> 00:40:38,037
Scott: actually.

692
00:40:38,078 --> 00:40:40,470
Scott: the actions are a scarcer resource than the money.

693
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:45,534
Scott: It's like you can't spend all your money unless you spend it all on Haciendas and water.

694
00:40:45,554 --> 00:40:53,784
Scott: if you spend all your money on cards and actually use the cards to get more money You're just gonna have so much money that you're not gonna know you can't spend it all.

695
00:40:53,824 --> 00:40:55,570
Scott: so it's like money isn't really a limitation.

696
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:57,700
Scott: But even so you're still.

697
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,830
Scott: you think money isn't a limit, right?

698
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:05,951
Scott: So I should just concern myself with my actions and not worry about how much money I have and that's true to an extent.

699
00:41:06,452 --> 00:41:15,984
Scott: but more money is more victory points because every ten dollars is a victory point and while money means more I You know, if you have a big lineup, you can get ten dollars.

700
00:41:16,004 --> 00:41:19,146
Scott: with like one card play Like you play one animal you get ten bucks.

701
00:41:19,367 --> 00:41:24,849
Scott: So That's a whole victory point, which is kind of a big deal when they add up turn after turn.

702
00:41:25,392 --> 00:41:30,757
Scott: That's the other interesting thing, you know, so even though you don't need more money You're still gonna be trying to get more.

703
00:41:30,777 --> 00:41:33,045
Rym: be difficult to fall into trap of.

704
00:41:33,406 --> 00:41:34,390
Rym: I'm out of the game is there.

705
00:41:34,751 --> 00:41:36,176
Rym: There's also the subtler trap of.

706
00:41:36,478 --> 00:41:43,160
Rym: it's very easy to for a novice player to get focused on Generating money and kind of forget to generate victory points.

707
00:41:43,381 --> 00:41:46,210
Scott: Yeah, a novice player would definitely make that mistake.

708
00:41:46,794 --> 00:41:52,761
Rym: I feel like what would add to the game is to Have a scoring chart and just keep your score up to date all the time.

709
00:41:52,821 --> 00:41:56,315
Scott: like the online version has a checkbox You can check.

710
00:41:56,356 --> 00:41:57,545
Scott: that will keep score every turn.

711
00:41:57,928 --> 00:42:00,058
Scott: Yep So if you want to do you can also.

712
00:42:00,359 --> 00:42:02,910
Scott: there's nothing stopping you from doing that.

713
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:08,598
Scott: I mean the game, you know has the standard scoring track around the board, you know You can just move your guys every turn.

714
00:42:08,618 --> 00:42:10,830
Scott: if you really want to know nothing stopping you from doing it.

715
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:11,996
Rym: Yeah, and I feel like you should.

716
00:42:12,056 --> 00:42:12,740
Rym: I think it would make it.

717
00:42:13,042 --> 00:42:14,148
Rym: otherwise it just adds the.

718
00:42:14,168 --> 00:42:20,110
Rym: you know A lot of earlier German board games will have the memory mechanic where things aren't hidden from the players.

719
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:24,755
Rym: but you have to remember it all and I Like Tigers and Euphrates.

720
00:42:24,916 --> 00:42:29,110
Rym: once I started counting who needed what color I did a lot better in the game.

721
00:42:29,692 --> 00:42:31,520
Rym: And it like is in El Grande.

722
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:36,923
Rym: if I just counted how many stupid people are in the Castille It's almost trivial to win if no one else is counting.

723
00:42:37,123 --> 00:42:38,630
Rym: Yep, and other people never count.

724
00:42:38,932 --> 00:42:53,330
Scott: yeah, and the thing is I do kind of like the The halfway through scoring because it sort of makes you think about like, you know, okay You know if I do something in the first half of the game, it'll get scored twice, right?

725
00:42:53,871 --> 00:43:01,770
Scott: so but if I do something in the The second half of the game, it'll only get scored once right?

726
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:02,893
Scott: It's like save your hacienda.

727
00:43:03,014 --> 00:43:06,726
Scott: right that hacienda will count double if you buy it early enough in the game.

728
00:43:07,127 --> 00:43:11,943
Scott: So it's sort of Scoring twice makes you sort of.

729
00:43:12,244 --> 00:43:18,210
Scott: but you know, it's like ah shit I gotta buy the hacienda now early in the game to get more points instead of later in the game.

730
00:43:19,621 --> 00:43:19,747
Scott: Yeah.

731
00:43:20,551 --> 00:43:30,924
Scott: So it's sort of it adjusts your purchasing patterns based on how if the animal decks about to run out and stuff Wouldn't happen if you scored every turn how's the end is it?

732
00:43:31,065 --> 00:43:32,010
Rym: You know, it's a pretty good game.

733
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:34,503
Rym: It's worth the money if you're a German boarding fan, and I'll just buy it.

734
00:43:34,684 --> 00:43:35,489
Scott: Yeah, I mean, it's it's.

735
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:36,734
Scott: you know It's a normal.

736
00:43:36,754 --> 00:43:39,646
Scott: I think it comes in the same style box as Attica, right?

737
00:43:39,666 --> 00:43:40,570
Scott: I think yeah same company.

738
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:43,530
Rym: I feel like it has the same level of staying power as like.

739
00:43:44,971 --> 00:43:50,430
Rym: It's better than a game like to call that's for sure our Maya or Mexico or all those games.

740
00:43:52,151 --> 00:43:53,315
Scott: Yeah, it's sort of like a night.

741
00:43:53,355 --> 00:43:54,761
Scott: It's not like an a-plus game.

742
00:43:54,801 --> 00:43:56,910
Scott: It's like a solid b-plus a-minus game.

743
00:43:57,552 --> 00:43:58,818
Scott: You know that you'll keep on your shelf.

744
00:43:58,858 --> 00:44:00,185
Scott: You'll bust it out once in a while.

745
00:44:00,627 --> 00:44:01,612
Scott: really good It's.

746
00:44:01,712 --> 00:44:19,368
Scott: it's really good for people who are not like super German board gamers and they'll learn a lot of basic German board game mechanics like, you know buying resources using action points Drafting from a from a draw pile and positioning on a board Tron style, you know,

747
00:44:19,629 --> 00:44:20,010
Rym: you know what?

748
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:21,274
Rym: I don't know why it's it.

749
00:44:21,435 --> 00:44:25,350
Rym: I can't really articulate why I feel this way, but I realized it.

750
00:44:26,072 --> 00:44:35,159
Rym: It reminds me a little bit of Lachita, but not game mechanic wise just in terms of I think it has the exact same Staying power before we'll get sick of it that Lachita does.

751
00:44:35,179 --> 00:44:43,971
Scott: it has some similarities to Lachita in terms of the positioning on the board with the hex tiles So and also the politics cards draw Drafting.

752
00:44:44,031 --> 00:44:50,110
Rym: but at the same time Lachita is so much more limiting and it has the influence factors and all the completely separate different game.

753
00:44:50,371 --> 00:44:57,160
Scott: I think what I like about Hacienda is that it just sort of takes all these like extremely Fundamental and basic German board game mechanics.

754
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:58,143
Scott: It doesn't have a stick.

755
00:44:58,544 --> 00:45:00,130
Scott: It doesn't have anything fancy, you know.

756
00:45:00,211 --> 00:45:02,309
Scott: It's totally just bread and butter.

757
00:45:02,671 --> 00:45:05,784
Scott: But it's like that really good bread and butter you get when you sit at when you.

758
00:45:05,825 --> 00:45:11,530
Scott: they serve you before you eat a meal At a fancy restaurant, you know, nothing special, but it's just solid.

759
00:45:12,092 --> 00:45:17,690
Scott: Does the basics really really well with really nice polish, you know, and it comes out a very nice game.

760
00:45:18,712 --> 00:45:19,918
Scott: Very happy with the haciendas.

761
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:22,550
Rym: So should we even bother talking about another game at this point?

762
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:22,971
Rym: I don't know.

00:45:22,991 --> 00:45:23,615
