1
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:10,946
Rym: It's Thursday, February 19th.

2
00:00:11,086 --> 00:00:12,171
Scott: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,251 --> 00:00:12,753
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:14,540
Rym: And this is the GeekNights Book Club.

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,563
Rym: Tonight, Ernest Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms.

6
00:00:25,872 --> 00:00:26,954
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:31,038 --> 00:00:33,703
Rym: So I've got the judging eye.

8
00:00:33,723 --> 00:00:35,668
Rym: To eyeballs.

9
00:00:35,688 --> 00:00:38,837
Rym: It's uh, so far, there's a lot of judging going on.

10
00:00:38,857 --> 00:00:40,060
Scott: A lot of eyes?

11
00:00:40,421 --> 00:00:42,329
Rym: Not so many eyes, but lots of judging.

12
00:00:42,349 --> 00:00:44,317
Scott: Well, I mean, it only does mention one eye.

13
00:00:44,337 --> 00:00:46,284
Scott: It's not the judging eyeballs.

14
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:49,254
Scott: It's not the judging, uh, you know.

15
00:00:49,274 --> 00:00:50,358
Rym: There are quite a few.

16
00:00:50,378 --> 00:00:52,507
Rym: This is a book and Alex said something.

17
00:00:52,527 --> 00:00:53,311
Scott: Is there a Cyclops in it?

18
00:00:53,793 --> 00:00:57,006
Rym: Not yet, but he said something like this in the forums.

19
00:00:57,026 --> 00:01:05,075
Rym: and now that I've read quite a bit of the book already, but the first few pages pretty much let you in on how awesome it is.

20
00:01:05,114 --> 00:01:10,445
Rym: I mean, if you've read the Prince of Nothing trilogy and you were waiting for the next book, you're kind of, you had expectations.

21
00:01:10,465 --> 00:01:15,285
Rym: I mean, we all knew it's about, Drusus had came in 20 years after the last books ended.

22
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:21,554
Rym: and that's not a spoiler because throughout the entire Prince of Nothing series, you keep getting quotes from a book that it came in and wrote in the future.

23
00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:30,062
Rym: There's no way that could be a spoiler unless it's an unreliable text, except that that's never been the case.

24
00:01:30,383 --> 00:01:32,430
Rym: No, not in this book at least these books.

25
00:01:32,831 --> 00:01:41,407
Rym: But anyway, it starts out, it hits you right over the head with something pretty awesome and then it just gets better and better and better and all right away.

26
00:01:41,448 --> 00:01:46,226
Rym: It starts out with like the Persian run up to the invasion of Greece.

27
00:01:47,491 --> 00:01:49,859
Rym: You know, but the first books were kind of like crusade.

28
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,923
Rym: This one is like Persia.

29
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:51,766
Rym: It's pretty cool.

30
00:01:52,830 --> 00:02:00,778
Rym: But more importantly, the part that I feel is very noteworthy is that our Scott Vacker has done something unprecedented.

31
00:02:00,858 --> 00:02:04,587
Rym: He has made a strong female character.

32
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:05,670
Scott: What?

33
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:07,635
Rym: She, she comes in right away.

34
00:02:08,015 --> 00:02:09,118
Rym: She's got a sword.

35
00:02:09,138 --> 00:02:10,904
Rym: She's out in the wilderness.

36
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:11,989
Rym: She's bad ass.

37
00:02:12,009 --> 00:02:14,359
Rym: She's the kind of person Luke Crane would hate.

38
00:02:18,101 --> 00:02:23,625
Scott: I think actually that reminds me in the, in the, um, in the mouse guard RPG, it's like, are you the troubled loner?

39
00:02:24,187 --> 00:02:30,388
Rym: If so, minus one, not just that, the troubled loner who's cool and collected and doesn't rely on anyone.

40
00:02:30,409 --> 00:02:30,870
Rym: Yup.

41
00:02:31,573 --> 00:02:32,817
Scott: It's like minus one to you.

42
00:02:33,259 --> 00:02:35,004
Scott: It's basically the, I don't like you.

43
00:02:36,107 --> 00:02:40,260
Rym: Uh, but I expect to be done with this book, I don't know, by Sunday.

44
00:02:40,801 --> 00:02:42,510
Scott: One thing about the book, I didn't read it yet.

45
00:02:42,691 --> 00:02:42,972
Scott: Right.

46
00:02:43,174 --> 00:02:45,505
Scott: Uh, and I'm glad it has the same graphic design as the other one.

47
00:02:45,525 --> 00:02:46,208
Scott: So it fits in.

48
00:02:46,328 --> 00:02:50,346
Scott: But, um, it's, I guess it'd be a spoiler to say what, what.

49
00:02:50,507 --> 00:02:51,330
Scott: it's a new trilogy.

50
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,483
Scott: It's not Prince of nothing book forward, something else book one.

51
00:02:55,045 --> 00:03:02,336
Scott: And I think that's not really the best idea because if you didn't read Prince of nothing one, two, three, I don't think this book is going to work.

52
00:03:02,597 --> 00:03:09,346
Rym: See at the same time it kind of does because it starts out with the same level of what the fuck that the original Prince of nothing did.

53
00:03:09,366 --> 00:03:10,290
Rym: Yeah.

54
00:03:10,431 --> 00:03:19,545
Rym: And it gives you the history and it does the same kind of referencing things with proper nouns consistently in such a way that if you're smart, you figure it all out.

55
00:03:20,268 --> 00:03:20,650
Scott: Yeah.

56
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:26,293
Scott: But I just don't, you know, I can't imagine how the book could be if it was the first one you read.

57
00:03:26,735 --> 00:03:27,679
Rym: Plus got a lot of things.

58
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:27,980
Rym: do that.

59
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,575
Rym: I mean, Hyperion and Demian, you couldn't read.

60
00:03:31,615 --> 00:03:34,911
Scott: I don't think you could read fall of Hyperion without reading Hyperion first.

61
00:03:35,091 --> 00:03:39,465
Rym: I don't get the impression that you're supposed to.

62
00:03:40,228 --> 00:03:42,093
Scott: Yeah, it just seems, it seems wrong.

63
00:03:42,614 --> 00:03:43,377
Rym: How does it seem wrong?

64
00:03:43,397 --> 00:03:54,258
Rym: It's, it's, it basically picks up 20 years later and tells it, it's kind of like death note two and the second half of death note, which also makes no sense if you didn't read the first day.

65
00:03:54,398 --> 00:03:54,619
Rym: Yeah.

66
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,144
Rym: But that they called that death note too.

67
00:03:58,410 --> 00:03:58,770
Scott: Okay.

68
00:03:58,791 --> 00:03:59,352
Scott: Yeah.

69
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:07,724
Rym: But uh, there's some similarities that are surprising and I don't think they were intended, but they kind of stand out because I've read both of these things.

70
00:04:10,472 --> 00:04:12,277
Rym: But uh, yeah, strong female character.

71
00:04:12,378 --> 00:04:13,100
Rym: Kind of surprising.

72
00:04:13,441 --> 00:04:13,962
Rym: Kind of cool.

73
00:04:14,043 --> 00:04:14,905
Rym: Mine is one of the circles.

74
00:04:15,969 --> 00:04:16,230
Scott: Yeah.

75
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:27,752
Scott: So, um, we've decided if you haven't noticed to sort of change the book club episode schedule, I think the original schedule was supposed to be like every fourth Thursday episode.

76
00:04:27,812 --> 00:04:30,945
Scott: So book club Thursday, Thursday, Thursday book club, right?

77
00:04:31,026 --> 00:04:32,633
Rym: Primarily we just didn't keep track.

78
00:04:32,934 --> 00:04:33,195
Scott: Yeah.

79
00:04:33,396 --> 00:04:35,204
Scott: Well not only did, well I kept track.

80
00:04:35,244 --> 00:04:41,537
Scott: We actually kept to that schedule for until right now and I'm, maybe we, I don't even, I could check, maybe we did keep to the schedule.

81
00:04:41,557 --> 00:04:42,562
Scott: I don't, I don't think so though.

82
00:04:42,602 --> 00:04:49,005
Scott: But um, basically we decided that that was too long because now we're doing only two episodes a week.

83
00:04:49,026 --> 00:04:50,753
Scott: So there's half as many Thursdays.

84
00:04:51,155 --> 00:04:52,521
Scott: So there were half as many books.

85
00:04:52,561 --> 00:04:55,111
Scott: I mean, that would be like one book.

86
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:57,140
Scott: It'd be like six books a year at the most.

87
00:04:57,521 --> 00:04:57,702
Scott: Right.

88
00:04:57,742 --> 00:04:59,368
Scott: That's not, that wasn't going to work out.

89
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:04,045
Scott: And so, um, the new schedule, we're not doing it every Thursday.

90
00:05:04,065 --> 00:05:04,507
Scott: Right.

91
00:05:04,527 --> 00:05:07,900
Scott: But the new schedule is when we finish reading the book.

92
00:05:08,301 --> 00:05:15,246
Rym: So I want to preface that by pointing out that we didn't actually get the book until a little while ago.

93
00:05:15,266 --> 00:05:19,706
Scott: So that doesn't mean, you know, I mean, we read fast, faster than a lot of people out there.

94
00:05:19,746 --> 00:05:26,736
Scott: So it'd be sort of unfair if we like, you know, announced the next book, started reading, we'd be doing every Thursday.

95
00:05:27,017 --> 00:05:27,900
Rym: We have these train commutes.

96
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,776
Rym: I mean, I get a novel and I just read it every day until I'm done with it.

97
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:31,158
Rym: I know.

98
00:05:31,239 --> 00:05:31,400
Scott: Right.

99
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:38,587
Scott: So you know, we do, we take our sweet time getting the book, we take our sweet time, you know, starting to read it.

100
00:05:38,869 --> 00:05:41,200
Scott: But once we start to read it, you know, it gets done.

101
00:05:41,762 --> 00:05:46,639
Rym: You're trying to make excuses almost like you're trying to try to make excuses.

102
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:51,523
Scott: I'm trying to not frighten the listeners away and have them pissed off because they can't, they read slowly.

103
00:05:52,046 --> 00:05:54,436
Rym: But that's still, that's very much the rationalization.

104
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:55,460
Rym: I'll paraphrase.

105
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,165
Scott: That's actually what I'm trying to do.

106
00:05:57,185 --> 00:06:02,323
Rym: I will paraphrase what you said into the terms that a non callous would hear.

107
00:06:03,967 --> 00:06:11,469
Rym: I'm so awesome that I apologize to you for the fact that I am in fact so much more awesome than you are.

108
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:19,162
Rym: I will enumerate the ways in which I am awesome while all the same while making sure that you feel bad about not being nearly so awesome as I am.

109
00:06:19,644 --> 00:06:21,731
Rym: Allow me to reiterate how awesome I am.

110
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,220
Scott: Well, your translation is so accurate.

111
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:26,727
Scott: It was in fact 100% accurate.

112
00:06:28,132 --> 00:06:35,803
Scott: But basically that's, I think that's the ongoing problem with the book club is that the goal is to make people read, read a book, read a book, right?

113
00:06:36,184 --> 00:06:36,926
Scott: But people don't.

114
00:06:37,388 --> 00:06:46,704
Scott: So we could, if we just did, you know, sort of threw them in the pool, you know, just like tossed them off the high dive, you know, and said, well, you don't read at all.

115
00:06:46,765 --> 00:06:47,387
Scott: Do you?

116
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:55,867
Scott: No, you don't start reading exactly the way we read, read real quickly and read really hard books and get everything and comprehend them one and almost 100% on the first go.

117
00:06:56,711 --> 00:06:59,402
Scott: People wouldn't be able to do it and they wouldn't like these episodes.

118
00:06:59,442 --> 00:07:01,449
Scott: They wouldn't get anything out of them and they wouldn't read the books.

119
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:16,600
Scott: You know, that's why we want to give people enough time to read, to not be scared away, but we also don't want to read so slowly that, you know, the episodes just never come out ever.

120
00:07:17,421 --> 00:07:19,629
Scott: So the new schedule is we finish.

121
00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:22,721
Scott: the books are, you know, we will read the book and finish it.

122
00:07:22,781 --> 00:07:25,653
Scott: And then the next Thursday after that, we will do the episode.

123
00:07:26,657 --> 00:07:27,039
Scott: All right.

124
00:07:27,059 --> 00:07:32,417
Scott: But there will be at least one, uh, non book club Thursday in between each.

125
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,568
Scott: So you'll never get two book club episodes in a row.

126
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:35,353
Scott: That's not going to happen.

127
00:07:35,595 --> 00:07:35,736
Rym: Yeah.

128
00:07:35,776 --> 00:07:39,077
Rym: Of course, Thursdays are kind of up in the air anyway, so we can do whatever on a Thursday.

129
00:07:39,097 --> 00:07:41,427
Scott: We're also having trouble with Thursday episodes lately.

130
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:42,753
Rym: I got plenty.

131
00:07:42,893 --> 00:07:43,917
Rym: I got a lot in the hopper.

132
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:45,300
Scott: All right, Mr Hopper.

133
00:07:45,341 --> 00:07:46,802
Rym: I got a hopper, Mr Hooper.

134
00:07:54,468 --> 00:07:56,832
Rym: But anyway, let's just get right into this with things of the day.

135
00:07:56,932 --> 00:08:02,568
Rym: So, uh, way back at RIT, I can't recall exactly when.

136
00:08:02,808 --> 00:08:16,754
Rym: I can't recall if it was a telecaster or a Stratocaster, but I do remember that at one point, Scott made a joke that apparently it revealed the fact that only myself, you're making that your thing of the day.

137
00:08:17,136 --> 00:08:18,604
Rym: Yes, I'm making that my thing of the day.

138
00:08:18,725 --> 00:08:20,133
Scott: It's news, not a thing of the day.

139
00:08:20,213 --> 00:08:32,200
Rym: No, the thing it's, it's worth being the thing of the day, but it revealed to me that only myself and the two Scotts, the Rubin and the Johnson had actually seen 2010 the movie or read the book.

140
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,327
Scott: A lot of people don't even know it exists.

141
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:38,807
Scott: They don't realize, like people know if you say 2001 is space out as they go.

142
00:08:38,827 --> 00:08:45,666
Rym: Yeah, that movie would go and the monolith and how 9,000 famous Zarathustra.

143
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:46,167
Scott: Yeah.

144
00:08:46,207 --> 00:08:47,149
Scott: Famous movie, right?

145
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,073
Scott: But they don't know.

146
00:08:48,133 --> 00:08:51,768
Scott: it had like a sequel 2010 and another was sequel with like 20.

147
00:08:51,768 --> 00:08:55,444
Scott: There's some other number that was bigger than 2010.

148
00:08:55,444 --> 00:08:59,999
Scott: But you know, the thing is I've never read the books, but I've seen the first two movies, 2001 and 2010.

149
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:05,576
Scott: And at the end of 2010, it says, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

150
00:09:05,617 --> 00:09:10,111
Rym: So we're sitting around, I believe it was over a Krispy cream.

151
00:09:10,573 --> 00:09:12,100
Rym: I believe that is when the comment was made.

152
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:18,727
Rym: Because as I recall, someone said something like, take anyone you want, but don't take the Boston cream.

153
00:09:18,747 --> 00:09:19,410
Rym: That one's mine.

154
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:24,604
Rym: And Scott looks up and says, all these can be yours, except Europa.

155
00:09:25,767 --> 00:09:29,422
Rym: And the other Scott and I crack up and everyone else looks at him like, what the fuck?

156
00:09:30,025 --> 00:09:31,311
Scott: No, no one got my joke.

157
00:09:31,934 --> 00:09:32,958
Scott: And I thought it was brilliant.

158
00:09:32,978 --> 00:09:46,405
Scott: It, it, it became a meme in the crew pretty much to me in the pretty much any, any time anyone ever said, you know, pick any one of these or, you know, take anyone you want, you know, or anything like that.

159
00:09:46,887 --> 00:09:48,373
Scott: I always, I made the Europa joke.

160
00:09:48,453 --> 00:09:49,518
Scott: I was like, except Europa.

161
00:09:49,538 --> 00:09:58,452
Scott: And then I even made a Photoshop, well, a gimp of, uh, you know, I took the old man from Zelda one, you know, says, he says, take anyone you want.

162
00:09:58,492 --> 00:10:01,184
Scott: Is it the heart container and the red potion and Europa?

163
00:10:01,325 --> 00:10:04,758
Scott: And I just added in Europa and I wrote, except Europa.

164
00:10:05,682 --> 00:10:09,696
Rym: Now, of course, if you haven't seen the movie, you might be, yes, this is a joke.

165
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:15,659
Scott: At the end of 2010, basically the message is at the end of the movie and you'll understand why.

166
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:25,872
Scott: there's a message if you watch the movie, but the message is, you know, all these planets are yours, uh, except Europa attempt, no landing there.

167
00:10:26,253 --> 00:10:26,474
Rym: Yep.

168
00:10:26,635 --> 00:10:27,318
Rym: Use them together.

169
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:28,081
Rym: Use them in peace.

170
00:10:28,141 --> 00:10:31,694
Rym: It's, it's a very uplifting, if slightly cheesy ending to that movie.

171
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:32,035
Rym: Yeah.

172
00:10:32,236 --> 00:10:42,243
Rym: But anyway, so it turns out that humanity has doomed itself because we are now sending a mission to Europa.

173
00:10:42,524 --> 00:10:45,553
Scott: Well, we're not going, we're not attempting landing.

174
00:10:46,015 --> 00:10:46,296
Rym: Yes.

175
00:10:46,456 --> 00:10:48,404
Rym: So I guess we'll talk on a technicality.

176
00:10:48,424 --> 00:10:53,081
Scott: We got to hope that the all intelligent alien thing is in reality, Europa is a big ball of ice.

177
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:57,637
Scott: So, uh, really, I'm not worried, honestly, really.

178
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,744
Scott: It's not, it's not troubling.

179
00:10:59,885 --> 00:11:08,495
Rym: So this article was posted on slash dot, which I go to more and more because it's slash dot is becoming the Byzantium of the internet.

180
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:09,218
Scott: It's strange.

181
00:11:09,238 --> 00:11:13,759
Scott: It's like all the people who are just filling slash that with crap left and went to dig in other places.

182
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,081
Scott: Right.

183
00:11:14,402 --> 00:11:17,456
Scott: And slash dot is gets the news a lot slower than he used to.

184
00:11:17,557 --> 00:11:21,575
Scott: And it's not what it used to be, but it's still, you know, it's still big enough.

185
00:11:21,615 --> 00:11:23,683
Rym: She ain't what she used to be.

186
00:11:23,723 --> 00:11:27,255
Scott: She used to be, it's still big enough to carry on with momentum.

187
00:11:27,636 --> 00:11:30,125
Scott: But the thing is the comment sections.

188
00:11:30,727 --> 00:11:40,363
Scott: it's actually, you know, because if you think about it, other sites have comment moderation, like dig and such and bark kinda, but it's not like slash dot slash dots.

189
00:11:40,403 --> 00:11:42,610
Scott: Moderation is still where it's at.

190
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:46,244
Scott: And because a lot of the people have left slash, I don't care about it anymore.

191
00:11:46,264 --> 00:11:52,424
Scott: The news is old, but the comments are like the best comments ever.

192
00:11:52,564 --> 00:11:57,220
Rym: But it really is for me now in terms of posting on the internet, like Byzantium.

193
00:11:57,662 --> 00:12:13,988
Rym: And I guess our forum is like, I don't know, I'm not going to extend that metaphor any further, but it, it lost some of its former glory, but it's still there, still plugging and all these other States sprung up around it like dig, but they're all crap and full of barbarians and they collapse.

194
00:12:14,048 --> 00:12:15,556
Rym: I mean, dig collapsed under its own weight.

195
00:12:15,616 --> 00:12:20,738
Scott: It's a useless garbage site now as far as I'm having been to dig and like it's a long time.

196
00:12:20,758 --> 00:12:24,570
Rym: It is dig at this point, in my opinion, is worthless.

197
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,356
Rym: It is absolute garbage.

198
00:12:26,657 --> 00:12:28,644
Rym: It provides nothing new, nothing interesting.

199
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:35,568
Rym: There is, I'd rather read YouTube comments than read the comments on dig, but slash dot has maintained.

200
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:37,196
Rym: It's like this walled garden.

201
00:12:37,316 --> 00:12:37,980
Rym: And that's,

202
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:44,765
Scott: if you're looking to read comics, you know, if you're looking for comments, if you're looking for the actual news, you know, well,

203
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,590
Rym: FARC still reliably

204
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:50,564
Scott: Google news in gadget sites like that can give you the news news

205
00:12:50,966 --> 00:12:55,863
Rym: and Kotaku will give you the funny and BB spot surprisingly still has good a thing of the day.

206
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:56,445
Rym: ish things.

207
00:12:56,505 --> 00:13:03,273
Rym: But I want to point out that on slash dot, this was announced Europa targeted as selected as target of next flagship mission.

208
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:10,538
Rym: And of course the first comment is something about the first post is all these worlds are yours except Europa.

209
00:13:10,699 --> 00:13:10,860
Rym: Yeah.

210
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,445
Rym: Attempt no landing there.

211
00:13:12,465 --> 00:13:13,047
Scott: There you go.

212
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:20,644
Rym: The second post, which made me laugh out loud, first post together, first post in peace.

213
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,550
Rym: I'm so proud of you.

214
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:24,213
Rym: Slash dot.

215
00:13:24,614 --> 00:13:26,140
Scott: Yeah, see, that's a, that's quality.

216
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:34,022
Rym: The first post on dig would just be like some gibberish about chiropractic conspiracies from the other side of Ron Paul's ass.

217
00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:38,352
Rym: Attempt no landing there.

218
00:13:39,896 --> 00:13:44,465
Scott: I plan not to attempt landing perhaps with a boots.

219
00:13:46,248 --> 00:13:47,230
Scott: That wouldn't be a landing.

220
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:50,381
Scott: That would be more of a crash and impact to some kind.

221
00:13:50,401 --> 00:13:50,742
Scott: Yes.

222
00:13:51,405 --> 00:13:51,645
Rym: All right.

223
00:13:51,686 --> 00:13:52,508
Rym: That's all I've got.

224
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:53,613
Rym: That's my thing of the day.

225
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:54,958
Scott: All right, so check this out.

226
00:13:55,078 --> 00:13:59,375
Scott: Somebody is making a, um, an independent movie, right?

227
00:13:59,716 --> 00:14:05,237
Scott: And, um, it's going to be in theaters and on DVD and the whole thing, it's a real deal film production.

228
00:14:05,318 --> 00:14:06,803
Scott: You know, it's not some joke.

229
00:14:07,104 --> 00:14:09,714
Scott: It's not some, you know, amateur YouTube thing.

230
00:14:09,754 --> 00:14:11,381
Scott: This is a real deal indie movie.

231
00:14:11,401 --> 00:14:14,714
Scott: It's not a real deal blockbuster, but it's a real deal indie movie, right?

232
00:14:15,476 --> 00:14:18,485
Scott: And you can contribute to this movie.

233
00:14:18,966 --> 00:14:27,239
Scott: You, yes, you who was listening to the show, you can, if you want to contribute to this movie in some way, all you have to do is go to the website and read.

234
00:14:27,881 --> 00:14:31,677
Scott: And, um, I don't really need to tell you what the movie's about.

235
00:14:32,058 --> 00:14:39,449
Scott: Cause if I tell you the title of the movie, which has already been decided, and by the way, it's a documentary, um, you will know everything you need to know.

236
00:14:40,371 --> 00:14:44,244
Scott: The name of the movie is the people versus George Lucas.

237
00:14:44,525 --> 00:14:47,356
Scott: And, uh, the website I think is like people versus.

238
00:14:47,496 --> 00:14:49,445
Scott: just give me a link to the website on our site.

239
00:14:49,566 --> 00:14:50,671
Scott: So you're all set.

240
00:14:50,771 --> 00:14:50,992
Rym: Yes.

241
00:14:51,775 --> 00:15:01,220
Rym: Once a long time ago, we got an email from a listener who, you know, it was one of those long emails, like the email that's like, you know, long time listener, first time emailer, you know, all that rigmarole.

242
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:02,025
Scott: It's like, really?

243
00:15:02,065 --> 00:15:02,749
Scott: I didn't know that.

244
00:15:02,909 --> 00:15:12,060
Rym: But I remember very clearly that this person pointed out to us that it was often difficult to hear the names of websites and URLs in the podcast.

245
00:15:12,642 --> 00:15:15,512
Rym: And I was like, have you ever been to our website?

246
00:15:17,037 --> 00:15:20,931
Rym: And they responded with the best response I've ever gotten from someone like that.

247
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:22,133
Rym: Three characters.

248
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:23,977
Rym: Oh, H period.

249
00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:28,005
Scott: Oh, yeah.

250
00:15:28,045 --> 00:15:37,164
Scott: If you're someone who like found, uh, you know, this podcast through iTunes and you subscribe to an iTunes and you've never been to our website, it's a, it's a crappy WordPress.

251
00:15:37,184 --> 00:15:40,036
Rym: That's going to be replaced by the awesome beta site that isn't out yet.

252
00:15:40,077 --> 00:15:40,297
Scott: Yeah.

253
00:15:40,378 --> 00:15:43,509
Scott: But go to frontrowcrew.com.

254
00:15:43,549 --> 00:15:47,605
Scott: Oh, look, I said a URL in the show while talking about saying URLs in the show.

255
00:15:47,886 --> 00:15:50,178
Rym: Actually, I, I, I surprised someone at work the other day.

256
00:15:50,198 --> 00:15:52,955
Rym: I was on the phone with some guy from like Verizon, you know, circuit thing.

257
00:15:53,015 --> 00:15:54,885
Rym: And he wanted the circuit ID.

258
00:15:54,905 --> 00:15:56,632
Rym: So I just gave it to him in the NATO phonetic.

259
00:15:57,214 --> 00:15:57,435
Scott: Yeah.

260
00:15:58,017 --> 00:16:01,930
Rym: He, he was taken aback one by the fact that I did it so quickly.

261
00:16:02,331 --> 00:16:04,379
Rym: And two, by the fact that he couldn't keep up with it.

262
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:06,146
Scott: Yeah.

263
00:16:06,246 --> 00:16:07,451
Rym: I was kind of saddened by that.

264
00:16:07,732 --> 00:16:13,915
Scott: The, uh, the IT guy at my, uh, who they got rid of, you know, big Mike at my work, he used to eat Mike.

265
00:16:14,297 --> 00:16:14,538
Scott: Yeah.

266
00:16:14,719 --> 00:16:15,121
Scott: Big Mike.

267
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:15,864
Rym: Is that like Mitch?

268
00:16:15,884 --> 00:16:22,497
Scott: You know how many mics there were at my, actually he was sort of a similar guy to Mitch and some, he had some similarities to Mitch, but not too many.

269
00:16:22,597 --> 00:16:25,792
Scott: Um, there were a lot, there were like five or six mics at my work.

270
00:16:26,174 --> 00:16:26,455
Rym: Wow.

271
00:16:26,836 --> 00:16:29,086
Scott: So he was one of the mics, but he's not there with us.

272
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:29,728
Rym: It's Jeff's.

273
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,504
Rym: We have a million Jeffs and they all work in the development side.

274
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:32,987
Rym: So it's tough.

275
00:16:33,027 --> 00:16:36,225
Rym: Cause we, it's like, you know, it's funny at my worst thing is two of them are in QA.

276
00:16:36,265 --> 00:16:38,556
Rym: So it's like, it used to be, I'd be like, so who do you want?

277
00:16:38,576 --> 00:16:39,822
Rym: Dev Jeff or QA Jeff.

278
00:16:39,922 --> 00:16:42,554
Rym: And then he's like, there's two QA Jeffs.

279
00:16:42,595 --> 00:16:43,037
Rym: Which one?

280
00:16:43,137 --> 00:16:52,017
Scott: I think I said this before, but if you don't count the people that acquired us, if you only count, you know, our part of the company, you know, when I got there, there were like 20 something people there.

281
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:58,524
Scott: There are only five people who've been at our part of the company longer than me at this point.

282
00:16:58,564 --> 00:17:01,517
Scott: I've only been there two years and four of those five people are named Mike.

283
00:17:01,718 --> 00:17:04,549
Rym: You've got a, you're, I don't know.

284
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:05,935
Rym: I could go in a lot of directions with that.

285
00:17:05,954 --> 00:17:06,676
Rym: I'm just going to let it be.

286
00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:07,461
Scott: Yeah.

287
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:09,750
Rym: So we read a book.

288
00:17:10,192 --> 00:17:10,795
Rym: I hope you're right.

289
00:17:10,815 --> 00:17:11,377
Scott: But anyway, yeah.

290
00:17:11,417 --> 00:17:16,403
Scott: The it guy, Mike, he used to always do, you know, the NATO phonetic because he used to, he was in the military.

291
00:17:16,584 --> 00:17:18,535
Rym: Do you know what the NATO phonetic, do you know it?

292
00:17:19,157 --> 00:17:21,412
Rym: Do you know the old world war II phonetic, the Abel Baker one?

293
00:17:21,753 --> 00:17:23,060
Scott: I don't know the Abel Baker one.

294
00:17:23,101 --> 00:17:23,763
Rym: I don't know what either.

295
00:17:23,885 --> 00:17:25,070
Scott: It's not that usually it's a lot.

296
00:17:25,131 --> 00:17:27,842
Scott: Mostly you do a Greek letters like alpha Bravo.

297
00:17:27,943 --> 00:17:33,097
Rym: It's alpha Bravo, Charlie Delta, echo Foxtrot, ghost hotel.

298
00:17:33,277 --> 00:17:36,765
Scott: I only know some of them.

299
00:17:36,785 --> 00:17:37,467
Scott: I know some of them.

300
00:17:37,728 --> 00:17:46,679
Rym: Thing is I only know like inherently and correctly all the letters that tend to be in circuit IDs with major like internet service providers.

301
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:48,789
Scott: All you really need to know is abcdef cause.

302
00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:50,898
Scott: then you can do hex codes and you're all, you can do anything.

303
00:17:52,564 --> 00:17:53,728
Rym: But anyway, we read a book.

304
00:17:53,749 --> 00:17:54,812
Rym: I hope you did.

305
00:17:55,835 --> 00:17:56,317
Scott: I read the book.

306
00:17:56,517 --> 00:18:03,235
Rym: now as we always do with these book clubs, we're going to assume that you have read Ernest Hemingway's a farewell to arms.

307
00:18:03,295 --> 00:18:06,782
Rym: So my arms, if you have time, I'm making that joke.

308
00:18:06,822 --> 00:18:10,380
Rym: The whole episode is not, I would recommend, I mean you could listen.

309
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:20,746
Scott: We're going to spoil a book where the statute of limitations ran out before I was born, but we're also going to be very careful just in case someone assigns you this book for your class in high school or whatever.

310
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:25,606
Scott: This episode we're going to make sure it does not substitute for reading the book.

311
00:18:25,706 --> 00:18:29,946
Scott: And in fact we should say some things that are wrong just to throw people off.

312
00:18:29,966 --> 00:18:32,902
Scott: So they'll get bad grades on their tests that they try to listen instead of reading.

313
00:18:33,805 --> 00:18:37,899
Rym: A farewell to arms is a sequel to a book called old man in the sea.

314
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,606
Rym: It's about a man who was a fisherman.

315
00:18:39,888 --> 00:18:44,344
Rym: Now he loses his arms in a horrible fishing accident and then gets sent to world war one.

316
00:18:44,685 --> 00:18:46,871
Rym: And now this proves difficult because he has no arms.

317
00:18:47,332 --> 00:18:51,404
Scott: Okay, that was a little too extreme.

318
00:18:51,424 --> 00:18:53,551
Scott: Too obvious.

319
00:18:54,354 --> 00:18:58,171
Rym: It's bad that I saw that episode of south park as I was reading this book again.

320
00:18:58,211 --> 00:19:05,723
Rym: So all I can think when I think of Hemingway is there is an old man and he goes out into the sea to get some fish, but he cannot get the fish.

321
00:19:06,165 --> 00:19:07,090
Scott: No, he cannot get the fish.

322
00:19:07,151 --> 00:19:10,465
Rym: And then he gets the fish, but then the shark gets the fish and he has no fish.

323
00:19:10,786 --> 00:19:13,696
Scott: So how many Hemingways have you read?

324
00:19:13,716 --> 00:19:19,662
Rym: I have read, well I've read most of his short stories and I've read a farewell to arms and at least the sun rises.

325
00:19:19,863 --> 00:19:21,811
Scott: I read, well you mean the sun also rises.

326
00:19:22,313 --> 00:19:23,237
Rym: Yes, I made my joke.

327
00:19:23,337 --> 00:19:24,261
Rym: The joke I always made.

328
00:19:25,104 --> 00:19:28,155
Scott: I read a, I read old man in the sea and sun also rises.

329
00:19:28,175 --> 00:19:30,162
Scott: This is my number three Hemingway.

330
00:19:30,222 --> 00:19:30,443
Scott: Wow.

331
00:19:30,543 --> 00:19:32,651
Rym: This was actually my first Hemingway.

332
00:19:33,955 --> 00:19:34,577
Rym: It's interesting.

333
00:19:34,677 --> 00:19:36,163
Scott: I read, I never read this before.

334
00:19:36,525 --> 00:19:38,836
Scott: I've only read it once and I finished it like last night.

335
00:19:39,158 --> 00:19:39,680
Rym: It's interesting.

336
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:45,786
Rym: I read it when I was pretty young and like I thought I got it and I liked it and then I was assigned it in school.

337
00:19:45,846 --> 00:19:49,180
Rym: It was like, Oh, once again, a book I've already read.

338
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,306
Rym: How, uh, how wonderful.

339
00:19:50,567 --> 00:19:53,100
Scott: But you know, just to talk about Hemingway in general, right?

340
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,126
Scott: First of all, the obviousness, right?

341
00:19:55,186 --> 00:19:58,898
Scott: Is that he has very simple pros.

342
00:19:58,918 --> 00:20:00,605
Scott: You know, he doesn't use lots of big words.

343
00:20:00,846 --> 00:20:02,876
Scott: He doesn't use lots of complex sentences.

344
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:05,245
Rym: It's a very distinct style that I like.

345
00:20:05,647 --> 00:20:07,233
Scott: He doesn't use lots of punctuation.

346
00:20:07,253 --> 00:20:14,804
Rym: Now coming from captain semi-colon, you might be surprised that I like Hemingway's pros, but it's, I wouldn't say, I mean, you know, it's functional.

347
00:20:14,824 --> 00:20:15,246
Scott: It works.

348
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:22,900
Rym: Not only that, but I would say it really, it puts you in a different mindset when you read a Hemingway versus like the Prince of nothing or Hawthorne.

349
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,544
Rym: I mean, Hawthorne is just, you know, four paragraphs of illusion to describe the color of the letter.

350
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:35,313
Scott: It also really helps because that's part of the reason I was able to burn through the book so fast and get it done for in time for the episode.

351
00:20:35,494 --> 00:20:35,735
Rym: Yup.

352
00:20:36,417 --> 00:20:40,990
Scott: Um, the other thing about Hemingway is that it's very, uh, manly,

353
00:20:42,013 --> 00:20:48,284
Rym: you know, I know in high school, if you're in high school, they're going to make you read farewell to arms or I expect they will because it's like,

354
00:20:48,365 --> 00:20:51,722
Scott: or something along one of the Hemingway, you read Hemingway at some point.

355
00:20:51,903 --> 00:20:52,144
Rym: Yes.

356
00:20:52,244 --> 00:20:54,956
Rym: But most people I know read farewell to arms in high school.

357
00:20:55,618 --> 00:20:57,165
Rym: I ended up my high school actually assigned.

358
00:20:57,285 --> 00:21:04,296
Rym: the sun also rises, but they always will talk about the code hero, you know, the Hemingway code hero in this book.

359
00:21:04,316 --> 00:21:08,092
Rym: They always talk about how, well, the main character wasn't the code hero this time.

360
00:21:08,152 --> 00:21:17,777
Rym: He wanted to be, he like, he was on the cusp of it, but he wasn't truly, and the girl was the code hero and this is a big upstart and she's more modern progressive and they always say code hero code hero.

361
00:21:18,139 --> 00:21:25,612
Rym: And if you read the cliff's notes, they'll probably say something like the code hero was and name a character and then the list, like the bullet points of what a code hero was.

362
00:21:26,937 --> 00:21:30,870
Rym: I prefer to call them the Hemingway hero, much like the gecky guy hero.

363
00:21:31,893 --> 00:21:35,502
Scott: Now Hemingway, how does that relate to, um, what's it called?

364
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:41,635
Scott: That manga, the, the ikigami manga, which one is that?

365
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:46,670
Rym: I just, I really want Hemingway hero has good alliteration.

366
00:21:47,132 --> 00:21:52,951
Rym: I feel like it's a much better way to put forth the idea than the code hero, but I digress.

367
00:21:53,874 --> 00:22:02,139
Rym: It is interesting though, you know, high school aside that Catherine was the Hemingway hero of this and the main character wasn't at all.

368
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:06,093
Rym: He was sentimental and he cared and he couldn't really deal with it.

369
00:22:06,415 --> 00:22:08,262
Rym: And he, of course he did drink a lot.

370
00:22:09,426 --> 00:22:15,647
Scott: Well, I mean, that was actually surprised because you know, in a sun also rises, they fucking drink.

371
00:22:15,828 --> 00:22:19,159
Scott: It's like they're in Spain drinking wine by the bottle.

372
00:22:19,199 --> 00:22:19,460
Scott: Right?

373
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:19,721
Scott: Yeah.

374
00:22:19,741 --> 00:22:27,133
Rym: I remember I didn't notice like the extent of that until it was in high school and a teacher pointed out, you know, she diagrammed all that they had drunk.

375
00:22:27,154 --> 00:22:37,900
Scott: But I remember very distinctly when I read that I read sun also rises for school and I was like, it, I was reading it like one of the early chapters, like they went to a bar and it was like, yeah, it's like, you know, X bottles.

376
00:22:38,001 --> 00:22:40,573
Scott: And I'm like, well, did they just call it bottles or something?

377
00:22:40,674 --> 00:22:41,679
Scott: And it's like, no, really?

378
00:22:41,699 --> 00:22:44,853
Scott: They're actually drinking entire bottles instead of glass.

379
00:22:44,913 --> 00:22:48,047
Scott: You know, where normal people would drink a glass, they drink an entire bottle per person.

380
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:50,779
Scott: I'm like, yeah, there's something going on here.

381
00:22:52,061 --> 00:22:53,746
Scott: He's getting wasted.

382
00:22:54,488 --> 00:22:55,512
Rym: But farewell to arms.

383
00:22:55,913 --> 00:22:58,663
Rym: It's more, the drinking kind of accelerates throughout the book.

384
00:22:58,703 --> 00:23:08,824
Rym: I mean, the point where he gets jaundice and I point out that that is right after he finds out Catherine's pregnant and it, it kind of, it kind of subtly implies, implies a lot.

385
00:23:09,185 --> 00:23:15,907
Rym: And there are implications that perhaps he is drinking more because of the fact that she is pregnant and he can't deal with it.

386
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:16,690
Scott: Yeah.

387
00:23:16,711 --> 00:23:28,696
Scott: It's like, you never really see like what the people are thinking, you know, all you see is what they're doing and what they're saying kind of, and you know, the, the, you know, the, everything else is implied,

388
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:40,683
Rym: you know, and that like some of my favorite scene, like the scene, there's a couple of times, especially early on where Catherine and Henry have sex and it has never stated there is no, and then he had sex with her sentence.

389
00:23:41,064 --> 00:23:42,469
Rym: There's no like description.

390
00:23:42,529 --> 00:23:43,231
Rym: There's no anything.

391
00:23:43,271 --> 00:23:50,177
Rym: There is just a series of dialogue between the two characters and everything else is implied a hundred percent.

392
00:23:50,217 --> 00:23:57,001
Rym: There is, there is nothing to tell you what is going on in a lot of scenes other than the fact that the dialogue hints at it.

393
00:23:57,824 --> 00:24:02,742
Rym: And that, that really puts you in a different mindset from the typical novel that you're reading.

394
00:24:02,802 --> 00:24:05,233
Rym: I mean, there's no scene, there's no nothing.

395
00:24:05,273 --> 00:24:12,600
Rym: There's just two characters kind of having this pretty realistic, not like terse conversation while they are doing something.

396
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:12,801
Rym: Yep.

397
00:24:13,223 --> 00:24:19,306
Scott: And actually I think because, you know, the only way you really get to know any of the characters is through their dialogue.

398
00:24:19,406 --> 00:24:19,667
Scott: Right.

399
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:29,743
Scott: And I think that actually, I think that this, the number one strength of the book is that how, you know, the, how deep and how fleshed out the characters are.

400
00:24:29,783 --> 00:24:37,439
Scott: Like they feel like real people, like people, you know, or you know, someone like that, or you, you can really imagine what the people are like, especially like Rinaldi.

401
00:24:37,459 --> 00:24:38,604
Scott: He's a, he's a big character.

402
00:24:38,624 --> 00:24:39,146
Scott: Yeah.

403
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:39,387
Scott: Right.

404
00:24:39,428 --> 00:24:40,010
Scott: The funny guy.

405
00:24:40,171 --> 00:24:41,819
Rym: He's like almost a Hemingway hero.

406
00:24:41,899 --> 00:24:42,120
Rym: Yeah.

407
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:42,802
Scott: But it's like.

408
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:47,761
Scott: the only way you can, you know, tell what the people are like is because you see them talk.

409
00:24:47,801 --> 00:24:52,137
Scott: like the way Rinaldi talks is how, you know, he's like the foodie guy.

410
00:24:52,197 --> 00:24:53,703
Rym: Come on, have a drink with me, baby.

411
00:24:53,723 --> 00:24:54,527
Scott: Are you all right?

412
00:24:54,768 --> 00:24:55,110
Scott: Yes.

413
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:56,416
Scott: He's a funny Italian guy.

414
00:24:56,436 --> 00:24:57,360
Scott: He's having a good time.

415
00:24:58,281 --> 00:24:59,565
Rym: He's having a good time.

416
00:24:59,766 --> 00:25:03,760
Scott: Well, you know, like, you know, it's that stereotypical Italian guy way.

417
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:06,227
Rym: It's like, he's got his own masculinity.

418
00:25:06,669 --> 00:25:06,889
Scott: Yep.

419
00:25:07,431 --> 00:25:22,182
Scott: But, uh, you know, and it's sort of like you get to know the characters in the book, not through some description, like, Oh, this guy, you know, he was, uh, you know, some sort of third party saying, Oh yeah, that guy loved to get drunk and, uh, get with the women.

420
00:25:22,363 --> 00:25:27,944
Scott: And he was, you know, real loose, but inside he was, no, it's, you get to know them by what they say.

421
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:34,473
Scott: And it says, if you met them in real life and you get to know them the way you get to know a person in real life, you know, you talk to them.

422
00:25:34,674 --> 00:25:34,774
Scott: It's

423
00:25:34,855 --> 00:25:53,713
Rym: weird how you get this kind of duality where on one hand, Hemingway, he like, he pulls you into this first person perspective at times where you're, if you imagine yourself as the character you're experiencing, because it'll shift between long sequences of just dialogue, character, a dialogue, character B or long sequences of dialogue where you can't even always tell who is saying what.

424
00:25:53,753 --> 00:25:53,974
Scott: Yeah.

425
00:25:54,015 --> 00:25:57,729
Scott: Sometimes, because usually, you know, the, the, what's it called?

426
00:25:57,769 --> 00:26:03,711
Scott: The, um, the way you're supposed to do it is you put a carriage return when you change people who are talking, right.

427
00:26:04,133 --> 00:26:05,719
Scott: But sometimes it'll throw you off.

428
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:10,219
Scott: Like, there'll be a paragraph and then there'll be some talking and it's like, wait, which one is who?

429
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:14,257
Scott: And then you have to figure it out and then go back and look at the alternation.

430
00:26:14,317 --> 00:26:15,985
Rym: And, but you don't usually have to figure it out.

431
00:26:16,005 --> 00:26:18,919
Rym: Cause it's almost always obvious or it didn't matter.

432
00:26:18,979 --> 00:26:24,609
Rym: Like, yeah, like it's a whole bunch of soldiers talking and you are like, you know, there, you, someone says something, he's making fun of the priest.

433
00:26:24,871 --> 00:26:25,716
Rym: The priest says something.

434
00:26:25,756 --> 00:26:26,239
Rym: It's obvious.

435
00:26:26,299 --> 00:26:27,323
Rym: It's the priest saying something.

436
00:26:27,705 --> 00:26:33,790
Rym: And then every time it comes back to your man talking, you know him because he's the only character you have a different perspective on.

437
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:39,574
Rym: You get his autobiographical discussion of himself, but you still don't get his thoughts.

438
00:26:39,614 --> 00:26:40,437
Rym: You don't get into his head.

439
00:26:40,538 --> 00:26:44,880
Scott: All you get when you get, you get basically some, you know, you get some things that he's thinking, right?

440
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,651
Scott: Like he'll say, uh, I wished something, something.

441
00:26:47,771 --> 00:26:48,896
Rym: Yes, but it's indirect.

442
00:26:48,976 --> 00:26:50,181
Rym: It's not what's in his head.

443
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:53,793
Rym: It's what he is telling you about what was in his head.

444
00:26:54,435 --> 00:26:55,900
Rym: Everything is filtered through him.

445
00:26:56,942 --> 00:27:02,263
Rym: And that is what really makes these, but like, that's what I love about Hemingway and especially about farewell to arms.

446
00:27:03,687 --> 00:27:04,048
Scott: All right.

447
00:27:04,088 --> 00:27:06,555
Scott: So what's it actually about?

448
00:27:06,615 --> 00:27:10,928
Scott: Well, you got this guy, he's a British American.

449
00:27:10,968 --> 00:27:16,025
Scott: So he's, he's, he's a United States citizen, but he's of, you know, he's a Hemingway expat.

450
00:27:16,185 --> 00:27:17,428
Rym: Yes.

451
00:27:17,448 --> 00:27:21,880
Scott: He is in Italy during world war one in the Italian army.

452
00:27:22,562 --> 00:27:24,390
Scott: It doesn't explain how that happened.

453
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:25,113
Scott: It just did.

454
00:27:25,153 --> 00:27:26,640
Rym: I love his answer is something like it.

455
00:27:27,001 --> 00:27:27,503
Rym: I got here.

456
00:27:27,523 --> 00:27:28,747
Rym: I'm here yet.

457
00:27:28,787 --> 00:27:29,329
Scott: He's there.

458
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:29,892
Rym: It happens.

459
00:27:29,932 --> 00:27:32,140
Scott: He's in the Italian army and he's a Lieutenant.

460
00:27:32,441 --> 00:27:32,642
Scott: Right.

461
00:27:32,682 --> 00:27:33,848
Scott: But they call him tenant date.

462
00:27:33,888 --> 00:27:37,866
Scott: Actually took me like, you know, like a minute to realize that today was an tenant.

463
00:27:37,886 --> 00:27:38,167
Scott: Yeah.

464
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:44,575
Scott: Cause they, all the other, you know, uh, ranks, they actually say major or Colonel, but for Lieutenant, they say tenant day.

465
00:27:44,776 --> 00:27:50,982
Rym: They use the Italian word, but the way they use the Italian word too, you get, you always feel like it's being used with affection.

466
00:27:52,006 --> 00:28:00,382
Rym: But part of that is because everyone likes him because he's a pretty likable guy and he can't, he's, he's stoic and he cares about his, he puts himself in danger to help the people around him.

467
00:28:00,442 --> 00:28:00,643
Rym: Yep.

468
00:28:01,024 --> 00:28:06,164
Scott: Basically he's not like a Lieutenant of, you know, infantry or bombers or anything like that.

469
00:28:06,525 --> 00:28:10,503
Rym: Do we really need to, I mean, I'm just summarizing, but we're assuming everyone read it.

470
00:28:10,704 --> 00:28:13,958
Scott: Yeah, no, but, uh, I just want to, you know, for the sake of it.

471
00:28:14,179 --> 00:28:14,420
Rym: Okay.

472
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,243
Rym: Summarize away.

473
00:28:15,363 --> 00:28:22,816
Scott: So, you know, he's the Lieutenant of the ambulance, one group of ambulances, you know, they drive out, they bring back a bunch of wounded people.

474
00:28:22,836 --> 00:28:23,299
Scott: That's what they do.

475
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:38,248
Scott: And, uh, you know, war of course is test sock and, uh, you know, things get crappy, but he gets to this woman, uh, that, you know, this British, uh, nurse basically, who's in one of the hospitals nearby.

476
00:28:38,268 --> 00:28:47,223
Scott: And then he gets injured and he's able to spend a lot of time with her and, you know, Hey, Hey, Hey, spend a lot of time with her while in bed, pretty much all day.

477
00:28:47,945 --> 00:28:51,735
Scott: And then he has to go back to war and everything sucks.

478
00:28:52,618 --> 00:28:55,026
Scott: And then he escapes and then the book is over.

479
00:28:55,768 --> 00:29:00,667
Scott: I got to admit when I, when I was a kid, I'm giving you the, uh, South Park old man in the sea summary.

480
00:29:00,988 --> 00:29:06,049
Rym: There was a Ming and he went out, there was a man, he went to the war, he drove the ambulance.

481
00:29:06,391 --> 00:29:07,778
Scott: He met the lady, he got injured.

482
00:29:07,818 --> 00:29:09,183
Scott: He met the lady a whole lot more.

483
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:14,684
Scott: Then he went back to the war, no lady, but then he ran away from the war and back with the lady.

484
00:29:14,865 --> 00:29:16,232
Scott: And then the lady, she died.

485
00:29:16,413 --> 00:29:16,754
Scott: The end.

486
00:29:17,036 --> 00:29:23,886
Rym: I got to admit that like when I was reading the book the first time, I, I appreciate this book a lot more, just being older and having more perspective.

487
00:29:23,926 --> 00:29:26,078
Scott: I could definitely, when I was reading it, I was like, wow.

488
00:29:26,118 --> 00:29:30,877
Scott: If I had read this, like when I was younger, I wouldn't have gotten anything out of it.

489
00:29:31,138 --> 00:29:41,121
Scott: I got a lot, sort of, if you're one of those people, like maybe when you were young, you read Hemingway or you were assigned it in school and you hated it, maybe, you know, don't discount reading it again.

490
00:29:41,141 --> 00:29:47,600
Scott: Now that you're older and wiser because it takes an adult to sort of get this book.

491
00:29:48,181 --> 00:29:53,889
Rym: But I still remember distinctly as a kid, I'm reading this book and it was interesting and it was Hemingway and I knew the deal with Hemingways.

492
00:29:53,949 --> 00:29:54,732
Rym: I'm going through it.

493
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:59,952
Rym: And the point where the carbonary come out and they're going to shoot him.

494
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:01,178
Rym: And suddenly he runs away.

495
00:30:01,219 --> 00:30:03,574
Rym: Like I remember I read past that part and I got to the end of the chapter.

496
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,384
Rym: I stopped and I was like, wait a minute.

497
00:30:05,444 --> 00:30:06,007
Rym: What the fuck?

498
00:30:06,047 --> 00:30:06,529
Rym: And I went back.

499
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:07,856
Rym: He's like, no, he ran away.

500
00:30:07,937 --> 00:30:08,500
Rym: Oh my God.

501
00:30:08,741 --> 00:30:08,881
Scott: Yeah.

502
00:30:08,901 --> 00:30:10,932
Scott: It's like he, cause it was so quick.

503
00:30:10,992 --> 00:30:19,287
Scott: It was like in one sentence was like, he ran out the door, he jumped in the water and I was trying to imagine like, how could he possibly jump in the water and make it?

504
00:30:19,809 --> 00:30:28,748
Scott: And they're like, it was some sort of river, but it was, it wasn't, I was like, what the, I didn't get it, but he escaped in the river by, you know, staying underwater as much as he could.

505
00:30:28,788 --> 00:30:31,340
Scott: And I guess they shot at him, but it didn't hit him.

506
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,932
Scott: It was, I was trying to imagine that action scene.

507
00:30:33,952 --> 00:30:40,299
Rym: It didn't really work, but you know, he got away one guns back then, especially pistols, not that accurate.

508
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:48,751
Rym: In fact, that's kind of four, not really foreshadowed, but it is noted several times up to this point that pistols are not that accurate.

509
00:30:48,872 --> 00:30:49,093
Scott: Yeah.

510
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:51,165
Scott: Pretty much any time, you know, they're talking about pistols.

511
00:30:51,245 --> 00:30:53,316
Scott: It's like, I want one that's actually going to work.

512
00:30:53,396 --> 00:30:55,929
Scott: I want one that can actually hit something.

513
00:30:56,070 --> 00:31:00,171
Rym: It's weird because on one hand, he like, I love how Rinaldi didn't even want to carry a pistol.

514
00:31:00,433 --> 00:31:00,573
Rym: Yeah.

515
00:31:00,614 --> 00:31:03,528
Scott: And he, he was practicing with the pistol and it took him a while.

516
00:31:03,649 --> 00:31:05,900
Scott: Cause it was very, you know, it's not easy to shoot.

517
00:31:06,341 --> 00:31:07,004
Rym: What was the line?

518
00:31:07,024 --> 00:31:07,305
Rym: I forget.

519
00:31:07,345 --> 00:31:10,720
Rym: It's something like actually using the pistol, remove any illusion.

520
00:31:12,846 --> 00:31:13,448
Scott: What was it called?

521
00:31:13,468 --> 00:31:19,514
Scott: There was a, it was, they talked about a guy who carried a rifle, even though his, he was a higher ranking officer.

522
00:31:19,554 --> 00:31:23,895
Scott: And the reason he carried the rifle was that he wouldn't look like an officer to the enemy.

523
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:24,860
Scott: So they wouldn't go after him.

524
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:29,480
Scott: Well, the thing is also he could actually shoot people with it and he did and it saved his life.

525
00:31:29,781 --> 00:31:37,890
Rym: It's a, I really, I'm going to assume that you all know the basic history of world war one, but in case you don't, it was a rough war.

526
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:39,615
Rym: Yeah.

527
00:31:40,016 --> 00:31:41,019
Rym: Rough is the word.

528
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:42,948
Scott: I mean, most people think about world war one.

529
00:31:43,008 --> 00:31:50,297
Scott: They think about, you know, like the Western front with the, you know, the, um, you know, the, the trenches and France and Germany, right.

530
00:31:50,337 --> 00:31:53,632
Scott: That whole area, but they don't really know a lot about the other parts.

531
00:31:53,672 --> 00:31:56,265
Scott: Like people don't know about Gallipoli and shit.

532
00:31:56,526 --> 00:31:56,767
Scott: Right.

533
00:31:56,867 --> 00:31:58,233
Scott: It's not something most people know.

534
00:31:58,253 --> 00:32:00,985
Rym: Well, most people don't really even know world war one at all.

535
00:32:01,045 --> 00:32:02,471
Rym: Like they, they know, yeah.

536
00:32:02,531 --> 00:32:06,508
Scott: Archduke Ferdinand assassinated world war one and then it was over.

537
00:32:06,689 --> 00:32:06,910
Scott: Right.

538
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:10,927
Scott: It's, and the thing is, you know, there aren't really world war one veterans left.

539
00:32:10,968 --> 00:32:13,278
Scott: I mean, if there are any, there's like a handful and that's it.

540
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:18,060
Rym: So actually Fark, every time a world war one veteran dies, they whip out the hero tag.

541
00:32:18,541 --> 00:32:20,948
Rym: I don't recall if the last one died or not.

542
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:23,697
Scott: I remember I went to a museum.

543
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:31,691
Scott: There was a temporary exhibit, I think in new Haven about with some world war one stuff and they had some audio interviews with world war one veterans.

544
00:32:32,052 --> 00:32:35,587
Rym: Actually the most fascinating thing I've, I spent, this is a couple of weeks ago.

545
00:32:35,627 --> 00:32:44,037
Rym: I was randomly looking around and I found this archive of photos from world war one that were colorized by experts basically too.

546
00:32:44,097 --> 00:32:45,180
Rym: So you could really see it.

547
00:32:45,221 --> 00:32:50,642
Rym: because it's weird looking at a war like world war one, you always kind of picture it in black and white.

548
00:32:50,662 --> 00:32:52,027
Rym: Same thing with world war two to a degree.

549
00:32:52,127 --> 00:32:57,086
Rym: And it almost feels like history, but not real history.

550
00:32:57,126 --> 00:32:57,487
Rym: It's weird.

551
00:32:57,528 --> 00:33:01,361
Rym: Like you don't get that visceral reality that real people were there.

552
00:33:01,401 --> 00:33:04,835
Rym: that hits you until you see it in color, like real color.

553
00:33:04,875 --> 00:33:07,266
Scott: Even if I think about like seventies and eighties history.

554
00:33:07,286 --> 00:33:20,760
Scott: I mean, I was alive in the eighties, but I sort of remember the eighties and sort of like, you know, that sort of grainy washed out color of like a Polaroid or bad, you know, analog is either that ultra saturated or that kind of technique color.

555
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:21,582
Scott: Yeah.

556
00:33:22,043 --> 00:33:34,482
Scott: It's like you remember things in the color of the recording media that we have and not in full real life color, but seriously seeing photos of world war one in color is a, is a visceral experience.

557
00:33:34,543 --> 00:33:36,891
Rym: It really puts you in the, in the, these kids places.

558
00:33:37,252 --> 00:33:46,490
Rym: And this book in particular, if you don't know much about world war one, it really, really like shows you and gives you a good sense of what it was like to be on that front.

559
00:33:46,511 --> 00:33:47,717
Rym: I mean, it's Hemingway.

560
00:33:47,757 --> 00:33:52,515
Rym: It spends a lot of time talking about just the harsh reality of walking down a clogged road.

561
00:33:52,536 --> 00:33:53,278
Rym: Yeah.

562
00:33:53,318 --> 00:33:58,023
Scott: It's like a lot of the stuff in the book isn't really, it doesn't have anything to do with like the main story.

563
00:33:58,063 --> 00:33:59,069
Scott: It's like you read the main story.

564
00:33:59,089 --> 00:33:59,854
Rym: It's just the love story.

565
00:33:59,874 --> 00:34:02,147
Scott: You read something like, I don't know, Lord of the rings.

566
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:02,388
Scott: Right.

567
00:34:02,408 --> 00:34:05,785
Scott: And pretty much all the words in the book are either poetry.

568
00:34:06,106 --> 00:34:13,556
Scott: I guess maybe Lord of the rings wasn't the best example, but they're serving the purpose of telling you the story of, you know, bringing the rings of Mount.

569
00:34:13,596 --> 00:34:15,241
Scott: do most of the words, Tom Vomitel.

570
00:34:15,882 --> 00:34:16,063
Scott: Yes.

571
00:34:16,204 --> 00:34:16,886
Scott: Right.

572
00:34:17,308 --> 00:34:22,161
Scott: But, uh, in this book, most of the words are not serving to tell you the story.

573
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:29,023
Scott: they're serving to just show you the world or make tangential points and to show you the war.

574
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:34,222
Scott: And they're just, you know, illustrating these scenes to deliver them to you to make you feel them.

575
00:34:34,503 --> 00:34:37,873
Rym: But at the same time, it's, these scenes aren't separate.

576
00:34:37,893 --> 00:34:39,038
Rym: Like there's the base.

577
00:34:39,379 --> 00:34:44,096
Rym: loves the story of the book, you know, the love story guy meets girl has baby and all that stuff.

578
00:34:44,578 --> 00:34:50,158
Rym: But there is the separate, I think equally prominent story of a man who fought in a war.

579
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:54,904
Rym: and you know, there's all that talk, all the different people, you know, the people who fight in the war because they don't know better.

580
00:34:55,246 --> 00:35:01,839
Rym: The people who don't find a fight in the war, but they're forced to by the people who know better, the people who want to fight the war, but they get other people to do it for them.

581
00:35:01,859 --> 00:35:04,890
Rym: And the fact that no one really wants to actually be in this war.

582
00:35:05,472 --> 00:35:05,974
Scott: Yeah.

583
00:35:05,994 --> 00:35:12,717
Scott: They definitely concentrate on the idea of, you know, if everyone just went home, it would be cool.

584
00:35:12,737 --> 00:35:14,766
Scott: And then the guy's like, no, you don't want to be invaded.

585
00:35:14,806 --> 00:35:15,329
Scott: He's like, what?

586
00:35:15,369 --> 00:35:15,912
Scott: I don't care.

587
00:35:15,932 --> 00:35:18,245
Rym: It can't be worse than what I'm going through right now.

588
00:35:18,567 --> 00:35:18,828
Scott: Yeah.

589
00:35:18,868 --> 00:35:20,698
Scott: Just he's like, why doesn't everyone just go home?

590
00:35:20,758 --> 00:35:24,494
Scott: And then at some point everyone does just go home, but it doesn't quite work out that way.

591
00:35:24,936 --> 00:35:25,197
Scott: Yeah.

592
00:35:25,257 --> 00:35:30,295
Rym: But the fact that he, despite the, I mean, he, he doesn't really talk big.

593
00:35:30,315 --> 00:35:34,774
Rym: Like he accepts the grumbling of his care of the people working with him and he tries to help them out.

594
00:35:34,794 --> 00:35:39,072
Rym: And he, you know, he works hard, but he still continues to fight the war.

595
00:35:39,132 --> 00:35:41,985
Rym: You can see, I mean, he even shoots those, that guy who tried to run away.

596
00:35:42,226 --> 00:35:42,547
Rym: Yeah.

597
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:42,990
Rym: Right.

598
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,075
Scott: But that was kind of weird.

599
00:35:44,095 --> 00:35:45,944
Scott: It was like, whoa, why are you doing that for?

600
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:47,852
Rym: Because he hadn't given up on it yet.

601
00:35:47,872 --> 00:35:48,635
Rym: He wasn't free of it.

602
00:35:48,695 --> 00:35:50,803
Rym: He was still his farewell to arms.

603
00:35:51,084 --> 00:35:53,674
Rym: He didn't actually give up until he was forced to.

604
00:35:53,694 --> 00:35:53,774
Rym: Yeah.

605
00:35:54,617 --> 00:35:56,344
Rym: He was just going to go back and keep doing it.

606
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,412
Rym: And he didn't really have a revelation.

607
00:35:58,593 --> 00:36:03,775
Rym: He just kind of realized suddenly that if he didn't try to get away from the war, he was going to die.

608
00:36:03,835 --> 00:36:07,490
Scott: Well, it wasn't, it wasn't until the carbonary guys were going to shoot him.

609
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:10,884
Rym: that, you know, he, but he didn't have any personal revelation.

610
00:36:10,924 --> 00:36:12,309
Rym: He just didn't want to die.

611
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:12,891
Scott: Yeah.

612
00:36:13,052 --> 00:36:14,678
Scott: It's like, he was just doing his job.

613
00:36:14,698 --> 00:36:20,832
Scott: You know, he didn't really, you know, he would like hang out with people who are like against the war and he'd be like, yeah, the war sucks, but keep it quiet.

614
00:36:20,852 --> 00:36:22,300
Scott: And then the BV would be super for the war.

615
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,230
Scott: And he'd be like, he was very, you know, it was like.

616
00:36:24,291 --> 00:36:42,084
Scott: all these people around him were very, you know, strong characters in one direction or another, but he was just sort of going along, just stay in the course, pretty neutral on most things, you know, just doing his job until event, you know, the point at which they were actually going to kill him is when he said, Oh, that's the end of this.

617
00:36:42,406 --> 00:36:52,864
Rym: But just the juxtaposition of him killing someone for the sake of a war that he doesn't even care about to him abandoning that war for almost the same reason, basically.

618
00:36:53,506 --> 00:36:53,747
Scott: Yeah.

619
00:36:54,208 --> 00:36:54,369
Scott: Yeah.

620
00:36:55,111 --> 00:36:56,757
Rym: And he never even like things back to that.

621
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:58,001
Rym: He never worries about that.

622
00:36:58,041 --> 00:36:58,946
Rym: That never bothers him.

623
00:36:58,966 --> 00:36:59,368
Rym: Yeah.

624
00:36:59,388 --> 00:37:03,065
Scott: It's like, he doesn't think, you know, he's not really bothered that much by a lot of things.

625
00:37:03,125 --> 00:37:10,112
Scott: All the only things he was really bothered by in the end were like, whether Rinaldi had syphilis, he thought about that.

626
00:37:10,533 --> 00:37:16,282
Scott: And he thought about the priest like a little bit, but no one else, like you didn't talk about like the major didn't think about him anymore.

627
00:37:16,463 --> 00:37:17,508
Rym: I felt bad for that priest.

628
00:37:17,528 --> 00:37:21,668
Rym: I mean, I'm an atheist, but I felt really bad for him because soldiers gave him a rough time.

629
00:37:21,708 --> 00:37:23,798
Scott: The thing is, he seemed to not mind being a priest.

630
00:37:23,899 --> 00:37:24,120
Scott: Right.

631
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:31,950
Scott: But the thing that I felt bad for him was, you know, uh, the main character, you know, he was at the beginning of the book, he gets leave.

632
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:32,291
Scott: Right.

633
00:37:32,372 --> 00:37:35,425
Scott: And he goes all around Italy, having a good time and all these places.

634
00:37:35,506 --> 00:37:35,707
Scott: Right.

635
00:37:35,767 --> 00:37:36,972
Rym: But he doesn't go to a bruise.

636
00:37:36,992 --> 00:37:39,683
Scott: He goes everywhere except a bruise.

637
00:37:40,004 --> 00:37:40,285
Scott: Right.

638
00:37:40,927 --> 00:37:41,208
Scott: Yeah.

639
00:37:41,288 --> 00:37:41,489
Scott: Right.

640
00:37:42,031 --> 00:37:47,112
Scott: He doesn't go to the plate, you know, the priest's house, he went to visit everyone else's town, except for the priest town.

641
00:37:47,132 --> 00:37:49,403
Scott: And the priest was like, I told my parents he were coming.

642
00:37:49,846 --> 00:37:52,278
Scott: They were even, they were ready for you to show up and you didn't show up.

643
00:37:52,318 --> 00:38:01,420
Scott: And I, I, I, I, I, that to me, I thought it was foreshadowing for later in the book, he would go to a bruise and sort of hide out with the priest family or something like that.

644
00:38:01,961 --> 00:38:05,178
Scott: You know, that's sort of what I expected, but that didn't happen at all.

645
00:38:05,218 --> 00:38:09,459
Scott: In fact, we didn't hear much about the priest again after like the first part of the book.

646
00:38:10,561 --> 00:38:12,129
Scott: So that was, that was a surprise.

647
00:38:12,773 --> 00:38:19,520
Rym: The one thing I have to say, I, the scenes at the end, the way this book ends, like, you know, everyone, it's a Hemingway book.

648
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,863
Rym: It's going to end on a downer.

649
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:23,973
Rym: That's expected.

650
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,858
Scott: And it's an Astro Boy episode.

651
00:38:25,918 --> 00:38:27,062
Rym: It's going to end on a downer.

652
00:38:27,744 --> 00:38:28,225
Rym: Oh my God.

653
00:38:28,245 --> 00:38:29,008
Rym: That last one.

654
00:38:30,592 --> 00:38:32,418
Rym: Astro Boy just gets worse and worse.

655
00:38:32,458 --> 00:38:35,527
Rym: I'm way, like, I don't know where it's going to end.

656
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:39,639
Rym: Well, Astro Boy doesn't drink, but daddy Walvers does.

657
00:38:40,422 --> 00:38:41,063
Scott: Oh, God.

658
00:38:42,627 --> 00:38:46,959
Rym: But when I was a kid, like I, I, the end was sad and I felt it.

659
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:56,937
Rym: and it was, it was a visceral and heart wrenching scene, but I don't know if it's age, but reading the end of that book again was a lot more gut wrenching than it was when I was young.

660
00:38:57,038 --> 00:38:59,350
Rym: Even when I, when I was young, I was reading it for the first time.

661
00:38:59,371 --> 00:39:00,739
Rym: I didn't know how it was going to end.

662
00:39:01,121 --> 00:39:02,729
Rym: And I didn't even know a lot about Hemingway.

663
00:39:02,749 --> 00:39:04,839
Rym: So I didn't really expect it to end badly.

664
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,456
Scott: Well, I think the reason that the ending is so gut wrenching, right?

665
00:39:07,517 --> 00:39:13,000
Scott: It's like, look, first in the end of the book, the big book, the whole book is separated into books.

666
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:16,259
Scott: And you'll be reading, you'll read a few chapters and then it'll be like book two.

667
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,728
Scott: You read a few chapters, say book three, right?

668
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,455
Rym: I like books that do that well.

669
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:20,817
Scott: Yeah.

670
00:39:21,118 --> 00:39:26,760
Scott: So at the end of, I think the second to last book is where they actually finally escaped to Switzerland.

671
00:39:26,921 --> 00:39:27,202
Scott: Right.

672
00:39:27,644 --> 00:39:29,170
Scott: And it's like, I was like, holy shit.

673
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:31,299
Scott: They actually escaped to Switzerland.

674
00:39:31,319 --> 00:39:36,156
Scott: They had this big suspenseful, like nighttime boat escape and it actually works.

675
00:39:36,196 --> 00:39:37,220
Scott: They actually make it.

676
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,472
Scott: And they're actually escaped from the war and safe.

677
00:39:39,512 --> 00:39:40,900
Scott: And I was like, wow, that's sort of crazy.

678
00:39:41,402 --> 00:39:55,188
Scott: I thought that for sure that, you know, he would like Switzerland would turn them over or they'd have, you know, cause you think every story like that is always like, you get to the customs and then you're fucked or, you know, you had to run away and you know that kind of, but it wasn't, they actually got away.

679
00:39:55,650 --> 00:40:02,894
Scott: So then book five was the final book was just so many chapters of having a good time in Switzerland.

680
00:40:02,974 --> 00:40:15,866
Scott: And all it was was having a good time in Switzerland, having a good time, having a good time, having a good time and all that, having a good time is just setting you up to knock you over with the very final chapter, which is where all the bad things happen.

681
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:21,829
Rym: And it's just, that is a heart wrenching scene because again, there is no description.

682
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:25,948
Rym: There is no point at which what the doctor is doing is displaying what anyone's seeing.

683
00:40:25,968 --> 00:40:28,620
Scott: I actually, I actually missed it a little bit, right?

684
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:35,753
Scott: Cause it's like the, when the doctor's like smacking the baby around, it's like, I think there was like one sentence that sort of escaped me.

685
00:40:35,773 --> 00:40:41,935
Scott: I had to go back to catch it where it's like, but the baby didn't cry or move or anything.

686
00:40:42,116 --> 00:40:46,496
Scott: And that, that was like one tiny, tiny sentence in like this, you know, at the end of a paragraph.

687
00:40:46,537 --> 00:40:57,863
Scott: So it was like, if you don't read it slowly and carefully, you miss that even though it's really simple sentence, but the fact that the exchanges, and then they tell you on the next page and then you go back and like, Oh fuck.

688
00:40:58,184 --> 00:41:00,913
Rym: We're just the dialogue of Catherine and him.

689
00:41:01,736 --> 00:41:14,585
Rym: And the dialogue is just, it hits hard, especially because Catherine is, I mean, she's the Hemingway hero and she, even to the end, the fact that she really is not afraid of death and it's not even that it's affected, she really is not.

690
00:41:15,086 --> 00:41:17,495
Scott: Well, she was also hopped up on gas.

691
00:41:17,736 --> 00:41:17,957
Rym: Yes.

692
00:41:17,977 --> 00:41:24,057
Rym: But even for that, I mean, she's in pain, but the whole book she's, she's aloof from life to a degree.

693
00:41:24,418 --> 00:41:52,195
Scott: Well, you know, it was all, I was, I had a hard time a little bit, like actually trying to figure out like what the exact deal was because there was a part earlier, way early in the book when they were, I think it was like just when they, he first got injured somewhere around that part of the book and they were talking to each other and it seemed as if like they weren't actually in love that they sort of both agreed to like pretend to be in love for each other

694
00:41:52,456 --> 00:41:52,657
Rym: more.

695
00:41:52,697 --> 00:41:57,543
Rym: What it was was that originally, I mean, remember he was going out horn and he didn't care and he thought of her as just a piece of tail.

696
00:41:58,145 --> 00:42:01,920
Rym: And the problem was she was a strong woman and she wasn't like women.

697
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:03,185
Rym: I mean, look how untraditional she is.

698
00:42:03,205 --> 00:42:07,987
Rym: The fact that he wants to marry her and she doesn't care about any of the formality or the church.

699
00:42:08,007 --> 00:42:08,811
Rym: She's an atheist.

700
00:42:09,112 --> 00:42:12,226
Rym: Like none of the societal constraints of the time mattered to her at all.

701
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:14,194
Rym: She's very progressive.

702
00:42:14,275 --> 00:42:20,294
Rym: She's kind of an independent woman and the fact that he thinks he's just having an affair with her right away.

703
00:42:20,314 --> 00:42:24,128
Rym: And she basically lets out, remember he's in the game in his head.

704
00:42:24,168 --> 00:42:26,176
Rym: He's like, he says, I love you.

705
00:42:26,276 --> 00:42:28,908
Rym: And he in his head, he's like, yeah, whatever.

706
00:42:29,189 --> 00:42:30,716
Rym: And then later he says it again.

707
00:42:30,736 --> 00:42:31,941
Rym: She's like, you don't have to lie now.

708
00:42:31,961 --> 00:42:32,804
Rym: We're not having sex.

709
00:42:32,844 --> 00:42:33,787
Rym: And he was like, what?

710
00:42:34,449 --> 00:42:34,770
Scott: Yeah.

711
00:42:35,392 --> 00:42:41,452
Scott: That's why it was like, you know, are they really, you know, or are they just watch the progression?

712
00:42:41,874 --> 00:42:43,560
Rym: She didn't really care at first.

713
00:42:43,741 --> 00:42:45,807
Rym: And he was kind of taken aback by this.

714
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:50,162
Rym: And because of that, he starts to earnestly fall in love with her.

715
00:42:51,707 --> 00:42:53,935
Rym: I mean, yeah, I just noticed how he didn't care.

716
00:42:54,055 --> 00:42:56,929
Rym: And then after this, like later on, he starts to miss her.

717
00:42:56,969 --> 00:42:58,016
Rym: And then he really wants to see her.

718
00:42:58,036 --> 00:42:59,624
Rym: He tries to see her every chance he gets.

719
00:43:00,005 --> 00:43:00,327
Scott: Yeah.

720
00:43:00,367 --> 00:43:00,608
Scott: Yeah.

721
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:06,533
Scott: Well, it's really, you know, over the course of staying in the hospital injured, it went from, you know, one to the other.

722
00:43:06,553 --> 00:43:17,647
Scott: And then when he was out at the war, you know, there's that, there's that part where he's like, you know, I can't, it was like, he's like, I can't, I can, you know, he needs to think about something, but he's like, no, I can't think about her.

723
00:43:17,707 --> 00:43:18,996
Scott: That's like the worst thing I can think about.

724
00:43:19,016 --> 00:43:20,022
Scott: I'll just be torturing myself.

725
00:43:20,403 --> 00:43:22,351
Scott: And then the rest of the paragraph is him thinking about her.

726
00:43:22,371 --> 00:43:26,993
Scott: And I was like, I was like, wait, you just said, don't think about her.

727
00:43:27,054 --> 00:43:29,347
Scott: And then the rest of the, and then he, oh, it's all he does.

728
00:43:29,669 --> 00:43:31,699
Scott: So it's like, well, that's, that's it then, isn't it?

729
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:35,320
Rym: Now, one thing I do want to point out too, in case any of you miss a lot of this.

730
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:49,399
Scott: And then it's like, he could have, after he, when he's escaping from the war, he could have escaped a lot easier than the Switzerland escape, but he decides, you know, like he knows that one guy who was going to help him in the bar, but he's like, nope, I've got to go and find, you know, Catherine, I can't be sitting around here.

731
00:43:50,181 --> 00:43:56,100
Rym: But there's this, there are a lot of literary references that I hope you all will catch.

732
00:43:56,641 --> 00:44:10,079
Rym: I worry that you won't, but any, basically my advice to you is anytime through the book where you thought something sounded like prose or like someone was quoting something they probably were, they were the characters quote stuff in character all the time throughout this whole book.

733
00:44:10,962 --> 00:44:19,419
Rym: Like the one that stood out, particularly because I actually had to arrange the poem into music as the midterm in music theory two at RIT.

734
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:26,207
Rym: But there's one point where he's laying and he's, he's cold and he's, he's tired and he's wounded and he just wants to get away.

735
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:31,571
Rym: And he's thinking about Catherine and in his head, he's thinking like Western wind blow blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

736
00:44:31,772 --> 00:44:32,234
Rym: And he keeps it.

737
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:35,549
Rym: He basically intersperses the old Western wind poem, you know, Western wind.

738
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:39,425
Rym: when will style blow the cold rain down will rain crisis, all that stuff.

739
00:44:39,926 --> 00:44:44,882
Rym: And he's interposing that with basically woman spaces, one cold motherfucker.

740
00:44:44,902 --> 00:44:45,444
Rym: God damn it.

741
00:44:45,484 --> 00:44:46,347
Rym: I just want to be back.

742
00:44:47,933 --> 00:44:51,025
Rym: But they quote poetry at each other more often than you might catch.

743
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:54,583
Scott: I mean, they're, they're very, you know, the it's, they're very smart people.

744
00:44:54,623 --> 00:44:58,417
Scott: You know, a lot of the other people around them are like, obviously not as smart.

745
00:45:00,401 --> 00:45:04,120
Scott: And it's like, you know, they're like, he's reading all the newspapers all the time.

746
00:45:04,321 --> 00:45:05,668
Scott: Other people don't read, you know, he reads.

747
00:45:05,989 --> 00:45:09,649
Scott: when he talks to that, uh, the old man, like way at the end of the book, that was actually a cool scene.

748
00:45:09,669 --> 00:45:12,686
Scott: Replies billiards with a really old man is one of my favorite.

749
00:45:12,706 --> 00:45:14,033
Scott: That old man was so awesome.

750
00:45:14,314 --> 00:45:15,701
Scott: Even though he's in the book for like a second.

751
00:45:15,802 --> 00:45:16,043
Scott: Right.

752
00:45:16,203 --> 00:45:18,412
Rym: But you know, you know, yup, you do know.

753
00:45:18,573 --> 00:45:21,668
Scott: And, uh, you know, the old man's like, well, have you read anything recently?

754
00:45:21,708 --> 00:45:23,680
Scott: He's like, well, I don't even know what's been out recently.

755
00:45:23,761 --> 00:45:24,788
Scott: I've been at this stupid ward.

756
00:45:24,808 --> 00:45:25,633
Scott: He's like, well, you read this.

757
00:45:25,674 --> 00:45:26,902
Scott: He's like, no, I don't know what that is.

758
00:45:26,922 --> 00:45:28,130
Scott: And he's like, did you read this?

759
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:32,653
Scott: And he's like, oh yeah, I read that something, it's cause he read it when he was, you know, sick, injured.

760
00:45:33,315 --> 00:45:44,376
Scott: And you know, it's like, ah, not too many other people are, are, you know, look, you look at all these people in the war and others and they're, they're not, you know, knowledgeable in those areas.

761
00:45:44,557 --> 00:45:53,187
Rym: It's out, you know, but I guess, I mean, what else can I say other than I used to say that the sun also rises was my favorite Hemingway like novel.

762
00:45:54,050 --> 00:46:04,204
Rym: And part of that was just because I read that when I was much older and I read farewell to arms when I was much younger, I think I actually find this to be my favorite Hemingway now.

763
00:46:04,224 --> 00:46:06,435
Rym: Of course I'll have to read sun also rises again to be sure.

764
00:46:06,455 --> 00:46:06,535
Rym: Yeah.

765
00:46:07,018 --> 00:46:09,891
Scott: I mean, I'm, you know, I sorta, Hemingway is weird.

766
00:46:09,931 --> 00:46:12,020
Scott: Like half of it is like, it's totally awesome.

767
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:14,969
Scott: And half of it is sorta on me.

768
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:20,850
Rym: I mean, you really, I don't know, it draws you in, in this way that other styles of pros really can't do.

769
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:22,496
Rym: It's a different experience of reading.

770
00:46:22,516 --> 00:46:23,379
Rym: Yeah.

771
00:46:23,459 --> 00:46:27,418
Scott: I mean, you know, it's just like when I read it, it's like, some of it is like, you know, like.

772
00:46:27,518 --> 00:46:36,988
Scott: I didn't feel like, you know, I read it and I wanted to keep reading, but at no point did I feel like, you know, like really excited about it.

773
00:46:37,028 --> 00:46:37,671
Scott: Like, yeah.

774
00:46:37,791 --> 00:46:38,675
Scott: Oh, this is awesome.

775
00:46:38,856 --> 00:46:41,527
Rym: Or I guess I did when I read it both the first time and again.

776
00:46:41,547 --> 00:46:41,989
Rym: Yeah.

777
00:46:42,009 --> 00:46:45,002
Scott: It's like, I don't, I don't feel really strongly about it.

778
00:46:45,082 --> 00:46:48,855
Scott: I just, you know, like I feel it, but it's never a strong feeling, you know?

779
00:46:48,875 --> 00:46:51,585
Scott: So it's like, I'm going along with it.

780
00:46:51,726 --> 00:46:56,223
Scott: I get it and I kind of like it, but I'm not like, it's not my favorite thing ever.

781
00:46:56,785 --> 00:47:09,468
Rym: Part of it's that for certain kinds of characters, Hemingway is able to express them and put them on paper and amazingly like he like ideas, like a character who is disconnected from the world or a character who is alcoholic.

782
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:14,424
Rym: Very few authors have put that on paper as well as he has, I think.

783
00:47:14,726 --> 00:47:18,726
Scott: I mean, that's definitely like, you know, the best part about the book is looking at all the characters.

784
00:47:18,766 --> 00:47:27,097
Scott: The thing is when I read them, I end up just sort of, you know, cause I'm used to books and stories where like, you know, everything actually matters.

785
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:37,378
Scott: So I'm constantly thinking about all the things that were in the book, all the people, all the characters, all the other plot points when really they don't, they're not coming back into it.

786
00:47:37,439 --> 00:47:38,624
Scott: That was, that was just it.

787
00:47:38,664 --> 00:47:40,132
Scott: That was just some flavor back there.

788
00:47:40,152 --> 00:47:46,803
Scott: And I'm still thinking about the priest and his town and his parents that, you know, didn't have the visitor that they were expecting and everything.

789
00:47:47,405 --> 00:47:49,695
Scott: That's totally out of the book, but I'm still thinking about it.

790
00:47:49,715 --> 00:47:55,964
Scott: So, you know, I don't know if I'm supposed to be thinking about it or not, but it's sort of, you know, the sign that a book was good.

791
00:47:55,984 --> 00:48:11,523
Rym: It, it, it, it affects you beyond the reading in some way, even if you didn't enjoy it, even if a book is dangerous to your ideas or frightening or disturbing, if you're continuing to think about it after you've read it, that is the mark of a well-written and good book.

792
00:48:11,985 --> 00:48:12,125
Rym: Yep.

793
00:48:12,527 --> 00:48:13,951
Rym: Unless it's just so bad.

794
00:48:13,971 --> 00:48:16,981
Scott: You were just thinking about how bad it was.

795
00:48:17,001 --> 00:48:20,274
Scott: You just can't stop thinking about how Tara is just so painful.

796
00:48:20,596 --> 00:48:21,439
Scott: It's like a bad deal.

797
00:48:21,459 --> 00:48:23,995
Scott: Like you tasted something real bad and you can't get the flavor out of your mouth.

798
00:48:24,055 --> 00:48:24,800
Scott: It was so terrible.

799
00:48:25,541 --> 00:48:25,762
Rym: All right.

800
00:48:25,803 --> 00:48:28,440
Rym: But on that note, let's stop because I don't want to analyze the book.

801
00:48:28,801 --> 00:48:30,309
Rym: Any high school teacher can do that for you.

802
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:34,328
Rym: And if you're trying to crib off of this for a book report, just read the book.

803
00:48:34,589 --> 00:48:35,934
Scott: It's not, it's an easy book.

804
00:48:36,195 --> 00:48:39,771
Scott: It's not, it's, I mean, it's not as easy as the RC, but it's, it's Hemingway.

805
00:48:39,811 --> 00:48:42,021
Scott: This is not a difficult and it's short.

806
00:48:42,081 --> 00:48:44,149
Scott: I read it in like three days, the equivalent of three days.

807
00:48:45,434 --> 00:48:46,859
Scott: So let's, we get to the next book.

808
00:48:48,161 --> 00:48:48,462
Rym: All right.

809
00:48:48,482 --> 00:48:48,945
Rym: I guess we do.

810
00:48:49,487 --> 00:48:49,748
Scott: Yeah.

811
00:48:49,809 --> 00:48:51,155
Scott: Do you want it for the next book?

812
00:48:51,175 --> 00:48:56,795
Scott: Do you want to continue a alternating pick or do you want to do some other system?

813
00:48:56,875 --> 00:48:57,960
Rym: or do you have a pick in place?

814
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,870
Scott: Oh, I can, I got, I got a boatload of picks.

815
00:49:01,774 --> 00:49:02,296
Rym: I'll let you pick.

816
00:49:02,316 --> 00:49:07,435
Rym: Cause I got to pick this one, but I warn you, my next pick will rely heavily upon what you pick now.

817
00:49:07,897 --> 00:49:08,238
Scott: All right.

818
00:49:08,379 --> 00:49:11,027
Rym: I'm going to pick, what are you going to pick?

819
00:49:11,127 --> 00:49:13,273
Rym: I'll pick going to go back to fantasy.

820
00:49:13,333 --> 00:49:16,664
Rym: And then my last choice was an Earthsea, right?

821
00:49:17,387 --> 00:49:17,688
Scott: Yeah.

822
00:49:17,728 --> 00:49:19,856
Scott: So that was the, that was the easy for the listeners.

823
00:49:19,916 --> 00:49:20,980
Scott: pick, right?

824
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:24,294
Scott: This time I will think I'll do the force room to read it.

825
00:49:24,334 --> 00:49:25,519
Scott: Pick don't pick Hawthorne.

826
00:49:25,539 --> 00:49:26,624
Rym: I swear to fucking God.

827
00:49:26,684 --> 00:49:28,592
Scott: I don't do, I don't think I've ever read any Hawthorne.

828
00:49:29,335 --> 00:49:29,636
Rym: Really?

829
00:49:29,656 --> 00:49:30,640
Rym: I don't know.

830
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:31,544
Scott: What is Hawthorne written?

831
00:49:31,564 --> 00:49:32,609
Scott: Nathaniel Hawthorne, right?

832
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:33,112
Scott: Yes.

833
00:49:33,413 --> 00:49:33,614
Scott: Yeah.

834
00:49:33,634 --> 00:49:34,760
Scott: What, what do you write Scott?

835
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:35,721
Rym: Go on.

836
00:49:35,741 --> 00:49:38,163
Scott: I think I will pick.

837
00:49:41,926 --> 00:49:44,788
Scott: we'll do cavalier and clay cavalier and clay.

838
00:49:45,369 --> 00:49:45,909
Rym: All right.

839
00:49:46,129 --> 00:49:46,770
Rym: Emily approves.

840
00:49:47,611 --> 00:49:50,135
Rym: And on that note, I think we'll leave it.

841
00:49:56,506 --> 00:49:59,030
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
