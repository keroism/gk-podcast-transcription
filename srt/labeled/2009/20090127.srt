1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,207
Rym: It's Tuesday, January 27th.

2
00:00:12,408 --> 00:00:12,829
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,849 --> 00:00:13,330
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:14,734
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,794 --> 00:00:26,928
Rym: Tonight, the little engine that could kill Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,932 --> 00:00:33,010
Rym: My DS hadn't been getting a lot of love lately.

7
00:00:33,115 --> 00:00:44,900
Rym: I mean I actually took it out of my bag like a month ago And I just I stopped bringing it around with me because the only game I owned that I hadn't already played that I wanted to Play was Castlevania, and I don't know.

8
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:51,241
Rym: I got about halfway through and then I suddenly got Intensely Intensely full of apathy toward the game like it was weird.

9
00:00:51,262 --> 00:00:52,809
Rym: I was playing I was enjoying it.

10
00:00:53,213 --> 00:00:58,805
Rym: I beat like this one really hard boss this big tall guy who punches things and I got a little bit further than suddenly.

11
00:00:58,845 --> 00:01:03,884
Rym: I was fighting the next boss and I just Like put the game down and didn't pick it up for like three weeks.

12
00:01:04,045 --> 00:01:07,090
Scott: that happened to me with You know Bioshock.

13
00:01:07,271 --> 00:01:10,779
Scott: I got to a certain point where everything was like covered in plants And I was just like.

14
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:11,669
Scott: I don't care anymore.

15
00:01:12,071 --> 00:01:13,116
Scott: It also happened to me with.

16
00:01:13,357 --> 00:01:20,650
Scott: I was playing Symphony tonight in a PlayStation emulator on the PC And I got to the upside-down castle and then I beat like a couple bosses, and I was like I'm done.

17
00:01:21,412 --> 00:01:23,090
Scott: Well, I didn't actually say I'm done.

18
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:27,610
Scott: I just sort of stopped playing and didn't feel like I wanted to keep playing.

19
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,229
Scott: Yeah, I know when I played it was it was pretty great.

20
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:31,354
Rym: It's weird more and more.

21
00:01:31,514 --> 00:01:34,104
Rym: like I feel like my gaming tastes are.

22
00:01:34,445 --> 00:01:41,996
Rym: I don't know if I want to say maturing But when I was a kid Maybe it was just because I had more free time and I had like you know at any given time I had like 10 Nintendo games.

23
00:01:42,037 --> 00:01:50,689
Rym: I hadn't beaten that I owned and I was willing to Continue to play them all oftentimes playing the same level over and over and over again for months at a time.

24
00:01:51,012 --> 00:01:52,330
Rym: Yeah until I beat them.

25
00:01:52,370 --> 00:02:01,661
Rym: But now like I'll play a game And if I don't get enough novelty out of it in a certain amount of time like this Meter of fatigue is constantly going up the longer.

26
00:02:01,701 --> 00:02:11,902
Rym: I'm playing, but there's also this novelty meter That's going up, and if the novelty meter doesn't get high enough before the fatigue meter maxes out I suddenly don't care about the game anymore, and I quit.

27
00:02:12,142 --> 00:02:14,290
Scott: I mean it's like you're playing Mario right, okay?

28
00:02:14,431 --> 00:02:26,478
Scott: So there's all the things Mario does all the mechanics of the game right jump get big firepower star bad guys vines right but after Level four right.

29
00:02:26,538 --> 00:02:27,963
Scott: you've seen everything there is to see.

30
00:02:28,003 --> 00:02:29,027
Scott: you've seen the flying fishes.

31
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:30,010
Scott: You've seen night time.

32
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,849
Scott: You've seen locky - you've seen Koopa.

33
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:32,252
Scott: You've seen.

34
00:02:32,272 --> 00:02:33,440
Scott: you've seen hammer brothers.

35
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:33,681
Scott: see.

36
00:02:33,722 --> 00:02:43,319
Rym: now at that point the game Especially a simple game or a platformer has to kind of escalate to the next level which is we have given you all of the tools You need to succeed now.

37
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:49,062
Rym: We are going to test your mastery of these tools Increasingly until eventually you either fail or beat us.

38
00:02:49,263 --> 00:02:50,669
Scott: right now the thing is right.

39
00:02:51,653 --> 00:03:01,645
Scott: When like for example look at the Castlevania right it's like in when you're in the upside right castle You're getting all this stuff new weapons new abilities like turn into a bat and shit like that.

40
00:03:01,685 --> 00:03:10,215
Scott: right when you get to the upside Down castle you don't really I mean there must be new stuff somewhere, but really it's just using the stuff You've got.

41
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:18,510
Scott: so eventually it's like The level is just more and more of the same even though it's harder and the mechanics are there aren't really new ones.

42
00:03:18,711 --> 00:03:20,763
Scott: So it's sort of like even though.

43
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:22,010
Scott: There's a lot more game left.

44
00:03:22,171 --> 00:03:25,430
Scott: It's like you know and the game that is is a fun game.

45
00:03:25,711 --> 00:03:30,530
Scott: I've done it enough to where I don't really want to do it anymore because it's not a different it.

46
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:35,721
Rym: I've noticed something kind of interesting that this is rarely happened to me.

47
00:03:35,761 --> 00:03:54,072
Rym: when I'm playing more than three or four games simultaneously Like if I've got four or five games that I'm actively playing I never get tired of them because I'll play one and if I get a little bit of fatigue I'll just play NS instead of tribes, or I'll just play counter-strike instead of Civ 3.

48
00:03:54,072 --> 00:03:58,696
Rym: You know for example, but now especially on the DS I've only really got this one game that I'm playing.

49
00:03:59,137 --> 00:04:06,908
Rym: so if the fatigue's up my choices are either continue to play or Not use my DS and do something unrelated to gaming.

50
00:04:06,928 --> 00:04:11,470
Scott: well I ordered I pre-ordered the Fire Emblem DS, which is finally coming out early next month.

51
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:15,470
Rym: Yeah, and I've been just pre-order it too, so we can play it quickly and then talk about it.

52
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:18,423
Scott: I've been doing the Japanese coach on the DS, which is pretty good.

53
00:04:18,442 --> 00:04:21,777
Rym: Yeah, I gotta borrow that when you're done with it I don't know if I'm gonna be done with it.

54
00:04:21,797 --> 00:04:22,580
Scott: I mean it has.

55
00:04:22,681 --> 00:04:24,690
Scott: they can teach you like thousands of kanjis.

56
00:04:25,071 --> 00:04:26,235
Rym: So you think it's worthwhile?

57
00:04:27,098 --> 00:04:27,740
Scott: I don't know.

58
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:32,552
Scott: It's not the greatest thing in the world, but there isn't another DS.

59
00:04:32,893 --> 00:04:38,210
Scott: I mean if you could find something else that does the same thing maybe not for the DS it might be better.

60
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,661
Rym: There's some really bad JavaScript web pages.

61
00:04:41,464 --> 00:04:48,970
Scott: I mean it's pretty sad But it you know it's like it does teach you to mean I'm learning the katas.

62
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:51,402
Scott: It works You know.

63
00:04:51,685 --> 00:04:57,270
Rym: but anyway I'll skip to this because we have news and stuff and we really got to talk about what we're talking about tonight.

64
00:04:58,111 --> 00:04:58,796
Rym: It's people.

65
00:04:58,836 --> 00:05:00,609
Scott: people saw it in the in the show title.

66
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:05,129
Rym: yes I know, but we have to talk about it in that they do not know what we have to say about it.

67
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:28,703
Rym: but anyway what I realized while I was playing this was that despite I The one thing that this Castlevania has the current one the newest one on the DS right now But the runes and the girl and everything is that I think it is the most perfectly put together Side-scrolling Modern since symphony the night Castlevania game ever made however.

68
00:05:29,465 --> 00:05:33,917
Rym: They've pretty much removed Exploration from the game a hundred percent.

69
00:05:33,977 --> 00:05:43,802
Rym: It is basically a fighting puzzle game not as in your fighting and solving puzzles but as in is a series of encounters fights which themselves are minor puzzles.

70
00:05:43,822 --> 00:05:56,982
Rym: you have to figure out the best way through each encounter and It kind of removed like all the leveling up bullshit And it really kind of pared down to where every item you get is useful And there's a lot less of that really lame secret BS.

71
00:05:57,022 --> 00:06:03,990
Rym: like there's a thing with numbers on it And if the last three digits of your gold match the numbers the door opens, and you get a kajigger.

72
00:06:04,315 --> 00:06:07,035
Scott: God yeah Hated that shit.

73
00:06:07,637 --> 00:06:12,450
Rym: so but at the same time I kind of liked the exploration like I want.

74
00:06:12,571 --> 00:06:16,830
Scott: I like the Metroid style exploration, but I don't like the stupid secrets.

75
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:21,329
Scott: I like the cool secrets like whip the wall that is obviously has a crack in it.

76
00:06:21,711 --> 00:06:25,730
Rym: Yes, not like find obscure secret from game facts and then implement.

77
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,288
Rym: But it's a great game, and I love it.

78
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:35,408
Rym: But at the same time the it's a. it's a tight race between the fatigue meter and the completed game meter.

79
00:06:35,448 --> 00:06:39,839
Rym: right now I hope I beat it because I kind I don't know.

80
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,203
Scott: I'll play it when you're done.

81
00:06:41,223 --> 00:06:42,166
Scott: I guess I don't know.

82
00:06:42,387 --> 00:06:42,768
Scott: we'll see.

83
00:06:42,788 --> 00:06:45,973
Rym: yeah Yeah, we'll talk about it eventually I don't know.

84
00:06:45,993 --> 00:06:53,336
Rym: lately I've you know we have these moods these trends and right now the trend in my life is really Anime role-playing games.

85
00:06:53,998 --> 00:06:57,870
Rym: Yeah, that's what I'm into right now, and you know we've had these it comes in and out.

86
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:01,790
Rym: I mean we'll have times where it's board games and nothing but board games for a month straight.

87
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:06,868
Rym: Yeah, I'm doing some board games lately, and then suddenly we're watching movies again, and it just jumps around.

88
00:07:07,028 --> 00:07:10,390
Rym: right now I'm all about the role-playing games in a big way.

89
00:07:10,651 --> 00:07:12,939
Rym: That's why I'm kind of looking forward to the New York Comic Con.

90
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:14,785
Rym: mm-hmm cuz I one.

91
00:07:14,805 --> 00:07:16,210
Rym: we're gonna hang out with Luke Crane again.

92
00:07:16,571 --> 00:07:19,884
Rym: We're gonna pester the PA guys, but anyway you got any news.

93
00:07:20,526 --> 00:07:23,660
Scott: news, okay, so Games for Windows.

94
00:07:23,761 --> 00:07:24,588
Scott: right you know about this.

95
00:07:25,811 --> 00:07:26,575
Rym: What in particular?

96
00:07:26,996 --> 00:07:28,503
Scott: well you know what games for Windows is?

97
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:30,250
Rym: it's games or Windows?

98
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:33,710
Scott: No, that's not what it now no, but but nominative determinism.

99
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,995
Rym: That's what it must be.

100
00:07:35,016 --> 00:07:37,507
Rym: it can be no more or less than so.

101
00:07:37,647 --> 00:07:41,524
Scott: so Microsoft You know they they label games certain games with games for Windows.

102
00:07:41,584 --> 00:07:47,290
Scott: right they have games for Windows Live Which is basically use your live account which is also an Xbox Live account right?

103
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:53,292
Scott: And it's basically sort of Xbox Live features on the PC and a few games Support this.

104
00:07:53,353 --> 00:07:57,344
Scott: every other game uses Steve because you know it's basically Microsoft.

105
00:07:57,364 --> 00:08:01,550
Rym: steam is really what it is now if steam Integrated with this or it integrated with steam.

106
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:04,899
Scott: I mean fallout 3 uses it.

107
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:08,570
Scott: so I launch fallout 3 in steam, but steam only acts as a launcher.

108
00:08:08,992 --> 00:08:12,652
Scott: But it also does its tech you know overlay on top of fallout 3.

109
00:08:12,652 --> 00:08:17,610
Scott: But then also in fallout 3 I can push the live button to go open up the games or Windows Live.

110
00:08:17,692 --> 00:08:18,690
Scott: So it's not an integration.

111
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:26,569
Rym: Yeah But I feel like if steam just integrated like I like the features of Xbox Live like I look at what it does And I would enjoy it.

112
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:28,097
Scott: Thing is right.

113
00:08:28,157 --> 00:08:36,078
Scott: games for Windows Live is like this pale imitation that barely implements any of the features of Xbox Live.

114
00:08:36,198 --> 00:08:37,210
Rym: well thus the problem.

115
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:44,430
Scott: It's like it's basically a complete failure on every level and in fact in Microsoft's recent layoffs They laid off the guy who was in charge of games or Windows.

116
00:08:44,571 --> 00:08:48,950
Rym: So so I guess the news is this isn't gonna get any better anytime soon.

117
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:54,961
Scott: Well, it's a. it's a question of is it going to get better if they're gonna get a new guy and try again and do it properly?

118
00:08:54,981 --> 00:08:57,155
Scott: or Are they?

119
00:08:57,275 --> 00:08:57,496
Scott: is it?

120
00:08:57,596 --> 00:08:58,077
Scott: is it dead?

121
00:08:58,278 --> 00:09:00,765
Scott: and is his team just now the king right?

122
00:09:00,825 --> 00:09:02,570
Scott: and that's that's sort of where we're going here.

123
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:07,185
Scott: And really I'd sort of like to see you know games for Windows.

124
00:09:07,426 --> 00:09:08,630
Scott: I don't know why they did that.

125
00:09:08,691 --> 00:09:09,849
Scott: They should have just called it.

126
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,251
Scott: You know.

127
00:09:10,271 --> 00:09:15,527
Scott: basically what they should do is they should just let you buy a thing for like a hundred and fifty bucks.

128
00:09:15,928 --> 00:09:20,210
Scott: that basically Turns your PC into an Xbox if it's powerful enough.

129
00:09:20,411 --> 00:09:27,209
Scott: I mean when you write a game for the Xbox you program with this Microsoft XNA platform You know DirectX and some other things.

130
00:09:28,012 --> 00:09:38,321
Scott: So you program a game and then you basically push a button and barely change any code, and if you did it the Microsoft way You'll have your game working on the 360 and also the PC.

131
00:09:38,823 --> 00:09:40,428
Scott: obviously you have to put in some changes.

132
00:09:40,468 --> 00:09:50,344
Rym: you know for Controllers and stuff like that, but you know it's not significant, but I honestly in the long run I really do foresee Microsoft going in a direction like that.

133
00:09:50,404 --> 00:09:56,830
Scott: like my vision my idea Microsoft has always wanted you know the the open gaming platform.

134
00:09:56,951 --> 00:10:02,644
Scott: We're just you know and every but every time anyone has ever tried to make an open gaming platform It has been a complete failure.

135
00:10:02,805 --> 00:10:09,210
Rym: part of it I think is that the gaming community has always reacted with immediate and violent disapproval.

136
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:23,541
Rym: I mean I remember way way back before the Xbox actually came out when the original Xbox was kind of Microsoft's making a game kind of like back in the day when we were all Nintendo gamers and the news was like Sony's trying to make a game console.

137
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:24,284
Rym: isn't that cute?

138
00:10:24,304 --> 00:10:27,108
Rym: yeah, but Little did we know.

139
00:10:27,972 --> 00:10:31,179
Rym: But the thing is back then even Microsoft was like.

140
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,427
Rym: consoles shouldn't be the way they are.

141
00:10:34,507 --> 00:10:41,250
Rym: they should be a commodity That is generic and uniform and just anyone makes them, and then everyone makes games for the one platform.

142
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:45,289
Rym: I think I said, but we live in a castle made of money.

143
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,581
Rym: Why would we open the door to our castle?

144
00:10:47,843 --> 00:10:49,090
Rym: and Sega said well?

145
00:10:49,593 --> 00:10:54,819
Rym: Our cast our money castle kind of burned down, but well I think the two problems here are thus right.

146
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:03,900
Scott: number one if you look at like the Phillips CDI or I don't know the 3do right those are open platforms.

147
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,830
Scott: anyone could make a 3do anyone could make a Phillips CDI right.

148
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:08,509
Scott: That's why there's so many different ones right.

149
00:11:10,094 --> 00:11:11,566
Scott: What happens is number one?

150
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:17,847
Scott: The people who you know like Phillips right would charge a license fee to anyone who made a CDI.

151
00:11:19,352 --> 00:11:24,690
Scott: So what reason is there to make a CDI machine if you're gonna have to pay this license fee?

152
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:32,786
Scott: You're just gonna have to make yours expensive and more expensive than Phillips's one And no one's gonna buy because everyone's gonna buy the cheapest one.

153
00:11:32,866 --> 00:11:51,690
Rym: in the case of Phillips I mean what one thing that Nintendo has always done very well And it was like they were part of the reason why video games came out of that crash of the Atari era Was that they they really nurtured and took care of what games were available on their system And they made sure that there were enough high quality.

154
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:58,350
Rym: You know Nintendo seal of quality good games to make it a success to where there would always be some good games on the system.

155
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:01,949
Rym: But Phillips basically said yeah, yeah bums make some games.

156
00:12:03,331 --> 00:12:07,182
Scott: Also, you know when you dig the big money.

157
00:12:07,222 --> 00:12:09,589
Scott: I mean most of the consoles right except for the week.

158
00:12:11,211 --> 00:12:11,914
Scott: What's wrong with you?

159
00:12:11,954 --> 00:12:13,961
Scott: They are sold at a loss.

160
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:15,907
Scott: You know they sell the Xbox 360 at a loss.

161
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:17,334
Scott: They don't profit.

162
00:12:17,355 --> 00:12:19,610
Scott: when they sell that the ps3 is sold at a huge loss.

163
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:22,321
Scott: So not as huge as it used to be but still you know.

164
00:12:22,381 --> 00:12:36,024
Scott: so if you know you're a company That's getting license fees from the games Right then you can sell your console at a loss a low price that everyone will buy it at and then when people buy games You make all your money back because anyone who makes a game has to give you money.

165
00:12:36,044 --> 00:12:38,577
Scott: if you make a PlayStation game You got to give Sony money.

166
00:12:38,597 --> 00:12:41,090
Scott: if you make a Nintendo game you got to give a Nintendo money, right?

167
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:52,362
Rym: Here's the thing with modern consoles the the hardware that is able to be used effectively by developers is Becoming more and more affordable because we're hitting a lot of limits of game development.

168
00:12:52,403 --> 00:13:04,770
Rym: where to really utilize the hardware That like the cutting-edge hardware that was in these consoles when they came out the next couple of generations Might not get you monetary returns in terms of making money from games.

169
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:16,785
Scott: Well, I think what it is is that if you have an open platform right for example the PC when you make a PC You don't have to give a license fee to anyone not to Microsoft not to you know anybody right.

170
00:13:17,146 --> 00:13:21,545
Scott: so an open gaming platform means more expensive consoles.

171
00:13:21,907 --> 00:13:26,349
Scott: right and Nobody makes money from the games except for the game makers.

172
00:13:27,214 --> 00:13:30,410
Scott: You know the cut the person who designs the consoles or makes them.

173
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:35,170
Scott: You know it doesn't make them so that doesn't get money from the software unless they also make software.

174
00:13:35,993 --> 00:13:38,723
Scott: So really it just can't compete with.

175
00:13:38,863 --> 00:13:49,909
Scott: you know the the closed Console platform where the console is such a low price sold at a loss You know and anyone who makes a game for the console has to pay a license fee to the person who makes it.

176
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:52,448
Rym: well I guess I could really see Microsoft pushing for.

177
00:13:52,951 --> 00:13:58,429
Rym: Eventually they sell an updated Xbox every five years or six years or whatever I mean.

178
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:03,990
Rym: well We don't even know how long this console generation is going to last and probably at least five years from when it started.

179
00:14:04,153 --> 00:14:04,930
Rym: I feel like it.

180
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:10,508
Rym: I feel like the drop-dead date at the end of this generation keeps getting pushed back by a lot of things.

181
00:14:10,568 --> 00:14:22,909
Rym: I'm thinking like 11 12 you know maybe 13 even yeah because the gamecube generation was Like when the gamecube came out like people were already rumbling about what was gonna come next.

182
00:14:23,873 --> 00:14:42,870
Rym: This time there wasn't as much rumbling other than there's gonna be a PlayStation 4 OMG, but I feel like what Microsoft would like to do is every five years ten years whatever release This is the reference Xbox and then at the same time release a thing where if you've got a Windows computer above these Requirements it is also an Xbox.

183
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:49,970
Scott: I know that's what I'm saying right people even though the PC right has the problem of it's an open platform.

184
00:14:50,131 --> 00:14:50,855
Scott: See they don't you know?

185
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:52,766
Scott: you don't make money from the games and whatever.

186
00:14:52,827 --> 00:15:06,150
Scott: right if They put out a thing that lets your Windows just any Windows computer play Xbox games first of all They'll get a lot of people back into Windows away from the Mac and the Linux that are eaten up at them.

187
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:08,890
Rym: Right, but they don't lose the non PC gamer.

188
00:15:09,131 --> 00:15:18,905
Scott: I just want a console that I plug into my TV market at all and people are willing to pay more a bigger price For a computer that also does other things than they would be willing to pay for.

189
00:15:18,925 --> 00:15:30,765
Rym: you know a non Sold at a lost console and Microsoft could get a lot of PC Part manufacturers on board because then they can start selling their crazy video card.

190
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:32,952
Scott: Yeah, if you get games faster It's like well.

191
00:15:32,972 --> 00:15:36,203
Scott: It's like this video card guaranteed to play Xbox games.

192
00:15:36,224 --> 00:15:37,970
Scott: You know that sort of shit all right.

193
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:42,490
Scott: So yeah, and you know they've already got the Xbox controllers and the games for Windows Live.

194
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:46,530
Scott: It's just they really bombed at it, and they could have gone all the way.

195
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:49,158
Scott: Just had your computer do Xbox Live.

196
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,241
Scott: the thing is like.

197
00:15:50,281 --> 00:15:54,910
Scott: Tycho was actually talking about how he asked some Microsoft people like what the Fuck right cuz he had a problem.

198
00:15:55,191 --> 00:16:05,029
Scott: He signed into games for Windows Live and then his Xbox which his kid was watching like Netflix streaming on Signed out cuz you can't be signed in in two places brilliant.

199
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:08,083
Scott: So Microsoft was like what are we supposed to do about that?

200
00:16:08,103 --> 00:16:08,545
Scott: and Tycho's like.

201
00:16:08,565 --> 00:16:09,350
Scott: that's not my problem.

202
00:16:09,976 --> 00:16:11,230
Scott: It's like your shit sucks.

203
00:16:11,474 --> 00:16:12,208
Scott: You need to fix that.

204
00:16:12,912 --> 00:16:15,623
Rym: Think about the power that man wields that.

205
00:16:15,744 --> 00:16:19,918
Rym: all he has to do is Mention briefly a minor issue.

206
00:16:19,978 --> 00:16:24,073
Rym: He had with something related to video gaming and the world has listened I think.

207
00:16:24,114 --> 00:16:29,890
Scott: he called them and said hey Oh, that's the fact that they would as as what an you know what you or I would do.

208
00:16:30,331 --> 00:16:36,809
Scott: But if I called Microsoft he called you know the customer support and complained the same as you or I would.

209
00:16:37,069 --> 00:16:38,455
Rym: oh You're bursting my.

210
00:16:38,535 --> 00:16:42,130
Rym: I was gonna make this really grandiose point, but never mind because clearly it's not true.

211
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,529
Scott: Yeah, it's not.

212
00:16:44,891 --> 00:16:45,574
Scott: It's in his post.

213
00:16:45,614 --> 00:16:52,421
Rym: you can read it though speaking of which if you if you live on the East Coast And you've always wanted to see gave in Tycho.

214
00:16:52,481 --> 00:16:58,901
Rym: You know the penny arcade guys in person They're actually going to be at the New York Comic Con this year.

215
00:16:58,921 --> 00:17:00,666
Rym: Yep doing panels and stuff.

216
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:01,308
Rym: They'll have a table.

217
00:17:01,328 --> 00:17:01,830
Rym: They'll be there.

218
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:05,000
Rym: So we're going to be there too, but before you get your hopes up.

219
00:17:05,421 --> 00:17:08,250
Rym: We're not actually doing any panels or events.

220
00:17:09,054 --> 00:17:12,970
Scott: We're just walking around Walking around looking to be there.

221
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,460
Rym: I'm not even sure which days will be there.

222
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,910
Rym: Scott and I might be there on different days.

223
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:19,829
Scott: It's hard to say, but I think maybe you know I think I'll be there Sunday cuz it's the quiet day.

224
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:23,785
Scott: It's like at first I was gonna go Saturday, but Saturday was my grandma's birthday party.

225
00:17:23,865 --> 00:17:27,603
Scott: so and also Saturday I kind of realized that's the crazy stupid day.

226
00:17:27,623 --> 00:17:28,790
Scott: Why do I want to go on Saturday?

227
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,590
Scott: Yeah, but I definitely want to go on Sunday.

228
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:35,130
Scott: But maybe because I have a press pass I could go on Thursday to the ICV to act.

229
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:37,330
Rym: I'm kind of thinking about taking that Thursday off work.

230
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:41,470
Rym: I kind of want to go to that because we get in yeah, and I can also go Friday.

Rym: I want especially because here's the deal.

236
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:58,516
Rym: the only reason I'm talking about the New York Comic Con on a Tuesday night is that one We're going to be there even though We're not going to be there doing panels.

237
00:17:58,657 --> 00:18:01,366
Rym: and there's actually a funny story as to why we're not.

238
00:18:01,426 --> 00:18:04,544
Rym: because you see every year We just go as press to the New York Comic Con.

239
00:18:04,564 --> 00:18:06,596
Rym: You'll walk around Interview some people.

240
00:18:06,717 --> 00:18:11,469
Rym: last year we played the wild card game and Discovered that it was terrible.

241
00:18:12,332 --> 00:18:14,537
Rym: Yeah, but the thing is this year.

242
00:18:14,557 --> 00:18:20,370
Rym: They emailed me not that long ago, and we're like hey, so uh people were talking about you.

243

Rym: so they were like Do you want to come to the New York Comic Con big?

248
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:38,473
Rym: I don't think they realize.

249
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:49,490
Rym: the guy who emailed me that we perform like eight panels every year at the New York anime festival and We're already pressed at the New York Comic Con mm-hmm, so I respond and I'm like oh you want us to do panels.

00:18:57,418 --> 00:19:01,110
Rym: He's like oh, uh I didn't realize you guys were professionals.

255
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:04,244
Rym: I'm sorry you want to do stuff next year.

256
00:19:04,284 --> 00:19:05,169
Rym: It's a little late this year.

257
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:07,117
Rym: Please come and be pressed.

258
00:19:07,157 --> 00:19:07,841
Scott: and why table.

259
00:19:08,002 --> 00:19:09,149
Scott: Why did you email us?

260
00:19:10,312 --> 00:19:11,548
Scott: It's like what did you want us to do?

261
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:15,589
Rym: Oh, they wanted to put us in the podcasting alley which with the table we could do that.

262
00:19:16,092 --> 00:19:17,922
Rym: Yeah, but I didn't really want basically.

263
00:19:17,942 --> 00:19:20,113
Scott: I don't want to sit there all three days though That's the thing.

264
00:19:20,896 --> 00:19:26,861
Rym: if we took one of those tables some smaller Podcast that really really wants to be there wouldn't be able to be there.

265
00:19:26,941 --> 00:19:27,282
Scott: actually.

266
00:19:27,343 --> 00:19:28,968
Scott: no they don't have as many people.

267
00:19:29,008 --> 00:19:31,016
Scott: they got more Tables than people in that area.

268
00:19:31,297 --> 00:19:31,840
Rym: it depends.

269
00:19:32,101 --> 00:19:34,290
Scott: they might know they definitely do have more tables than pot.

270
00:19:34,431 --> 00:19:35,457
Rym: Actually, he gave me a list.

271
00:19:35,477 --> 00:19:37,108
Rym: They got a lot of podcasts.

272
00:19:37,148 --> 00:19:41,150
Rym: really I saw the list was pretty short, but maybe people maybe the list he gave.

273
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,635
Scott: I guess we'll find out if we go.

274
00:19:42,655 --> 00:19:48,681
Rym: look at the map you know, but anyway the the result is Next year the New York Comic Con.

275
00:19:48,701 --> 00:19:50,390
Rym: We're probably going to be doing the same kind.

276
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:52,048
Rym: I just do it packs every one.

277
00:19:52,069 --> 00:19:54,781
Scott: thing I think was interesting is we were gonna do a panel that was sort of like.

278
00:19:54,821 --> 00:19:57,873
Scott: you know comics for the manga reader and Manga for the con.

279
00:19:57,893 --> 00:20:17,514
Scott: you know non manga comics reader right, but I find it funny that on the schedule Wizard you know wizard magazine and also because they also do an anime magazine anime insider or something like that They're doing that exact panel from both sides, and I was like huh is that a coincidence or Or what?

280
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:19,363
Rym: well we'll see how well they do it.

281
00:20:19,403 --> 00:20:20,167
Rym: Maybe we'll attend.

282
00:20:20,508 --> 00:20:33,390
Rym: nah I don't know if I'll be there that day But regardless the reason the main reason I bring it up since you probably won't find us at the con unless you Either know what we look like or more importantly if you just walk around listening for us.

283
00:20:33,831 --> 00:20:41,690
Rym: Yeah, that's how most people seem to find us at conventions, but at the New York Comic Con They're making a big deal about expanding their gaming content.

284
00:20:42,011 --> 00:20:51,824
Rym: There's gonna be a lot of video games stuff and a lot of gaming stuff and Luke cranes gonna be there with the mouse guard The mouse guard RPG table and with David Peterson.

285
00:20:52,226 --> 00:20:56,209
Rym: if you're thinking about going I'd say go for at least one day to check out the gaming con.

286
00:20:56,310 --> 00:21:00,589
Scott: It's definitely a one-day con unless you're a crazy comics superhero nerd.

287
00:21:00,629 --> 00:21:05,850
Scott: yes If you were really into color unless you're really into like you know nerdy TV shows.

288
00:21:06,091 --> 00:21:08,320
Rym: Yeah, but we got or you live.

289
00:21:08,361 --> 00:21:09,485
Rym: You know like in New York City.

290
00:21:09,526 --> 00:21:10,490
Rym: You can just pop over there.

291
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:22,283
Rym: Yeah, why not, but February 6th through 8th, so not this weekend But next weekend at the Jacob Javits Center in New York City Which is basically on the far west side of town in the middle of nowhere.

292
00:21:22,585 --> 00:21:23,930
Rym: there aren't even hobos over there.

293
00:21:23,971 --> 00:21:24,542
Rym: There's no food.

294
00:21:25,292 --> 00:21:27,890
Scott: You do the street meat and there's expensive food in the convention center.

295
00:21:28,193 --> 00:21:36,432
Scott: I suggest if you need food Get in a cab or a bus or something and get away from the convention center because otherwise you're gonna be there right you're gonna Be hungry.

296
00:21:36,452 --> 00:21:46,710
Rym: the only food is either a fake Starbucks the street meat outside Or there's gonna be like this waffle guy making waffles the closest thing you can get the closest.

297
00:21:47,415 --> 00:21:50,234
Scott: Not you know thing to the convention center That's not in it.

298
00:21:50,515 --> 00:21:52,043
Scott: or a street meat is a McDonald's.

299
00:21:52,063 --> 00:21:53,189
Scott: so you need to go pretty far.

300
00:21:53,531 --> 00:22:04,155
Rym: No, no no the problem is those waffles because you'll be hungry And you'll smell these waffles and they will smell the longer you were there like the best food You have ever smelled in your life.

301
00:22:04,536 --> 00:22:07,927
Rym: They pump that smell around like we know a guy who's vegan.

302
00:22:08,007 --> 00:22:08,770
Rym: He's a comic artist.

303
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:13,262
Rym: He was sitting across from the waffle stand one year, and he's vegan.

304
00:22:13,282 --> 00:22:14,104
Rym: He can't eat that stuff.

305
00:22:14,184 --> 00:22:15,628
Scott: Why can't eat a waffle?

306
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:16,130
Rym: milking eggs?

307
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:19,098
Rym: Okay, so by the end of the con.

308
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,485
Rym: He almost bought one.

309
00:22:20,545 --> 00:22:21,349
Rym: It smelled so good.

310
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:25,910
Rym: Yeah, but the thing is they're like eight bucks, and they're just a waffle.

311
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:29,827
Scott: Yeah, you know great that a con had like great prices on the concessions.

312
00:22:29,867 --> 00:22:33,727
Scott: remember that It's like I got the chicken fingers and fries and they were like they're like four dollars.

313
00:22:33,747 --> 00:22:34,210
Scott: I was like hells.

314
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,082
Rym: Yes, yeah, and even Otakon despite.

315
00:22:36,103 --> 00:22:39,438
Rym: You know it is still kind of a rip Ripoff but not as much as the Javits.

316
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:42,690
Rym: well Otakon has cut the prices like in half over the years.

317
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:43,876
Rym: They did a good job of that.

318
00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:46,150
Scott: They pushed it down, but not down far enough.

319
00:22:47,272 --> 00:22:49,749
Rym: But anyway, New York Comic Con will be there.

320
00:22:50,131 --> 00:22:56,996
Rym: Well if you don't go you'll hear a lot about it since we'll have those press things and we'll walk around Doing the press thing.

321
00:22:57,096 --> 00:22:59,525
Rym: maybe we'll record and or film things.

322
00:22:59,907 --> 00:23:00,770
Scott: maybe we'll see.

323
00:23:07,332 --> 00:23:09,207
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

324
00:23:09,368 --> 00:23:17,050
Rym: now There's a lot of buzz about how those Final Fantasy legend games at least some of them are gonna be coming out in the u.s.. At some point.

325
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:23,719
Scott: I think they've only mentioned number two which is sad because I like number one and three more even though no one else seems To agree with me because two was the best.

326
00:23:23,879 --> 00:23:26,912
Rym: one one was broken and three one Bullshit.

327
00:23:27,052 --> 00:23:30,463
Scott: one had an awesome tower right and three had.

328
00:23:30,503 --> 00:23:33,815
Scott: your dad is a stealth bomber spoilers But she's.

329
00:23:33,856 --> 00:23:34,881
Scott: how awesome is that?

330
00:23:35,042 --> 00:23:36,510
Scott: your dad is a stealth bomber.

331
00:23:36,891 --> 00:23:37,594
Scott: That's the best.

332
00:23:37,815 --> 00:23:38,819
Scott: what beats that then?

333
00:23:38,859 --> 00:23:40,726
Scott: nothing could possibly be more Japanese.

334
00:23:40,746 --> 00:23:41,509
Rym: You know what beats that?

335
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:44,290
Scott: Anything everything anything?

336
00:23:45,112 --> 00:23:45,981
Rym: Everything I see.

337
00:23:46,022 --> 00:23:47,910
Rym: we're in a chord everything.

338
00:23:49,374 --> 00:23:53,437
Rym: My thing of the day in case you have never seen this is The first bit.

339
00:23:53,497 --> 00:24:02,618
Rym: enough to see what the deal was with the original Final Fantasy legend - now There's a lot more to this story than meets the eye And I want to kind of bring this up.

340
00:24:02,658 --> 00:24:12,664
Rym: you can do all the reading on your own if you're Really interested in the history, but when I was a kid Final Fantasy came out on the NES, and I thought it was like the best game.

341
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:20,596
Rym: I had ever played like I. I Loved the ever living hell out of that game mm-hmm, and I beat it like four times I optimized.

342
00:24:20,656 --> 00:24:22,630
Rym: I figured like I would go with all these different parties.

343
00:24:23,112 --> 00:24:25,041
Rym: I tried to beat the game with four white mages found.

344
00:24:25,061 --> 00:24:26,568
Rym: That's actually not that hard.

345
00:24:29,251 --> 00:24:31,420
Scott: It's hard in the beginning for black mages.

346
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,910
Scott: nah, not happy because you can't heal for shit.

347
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,740
Scott: Yeah, these are the white mages.

348
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,470
Scott: you might not do as much damage right away.

349
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:40,210
Scott: Not only that you can heal up, and then you could do my damage later.

350
00:24:40,451 --> 00:24:45,657
Rym: It's not that you can't heal for shit so much as the fact that in the early game You can't do damage.

351
00:24:45,838 --> 00:24:48,910
Rym: you can cast fire only so many times, and then you're left with a knife.

352
00:24:49,372 --> 00:24:50,335
Scott: Yeah, that does nothing.

353
00:24:50,596 --> 00:24:54,049
Scott: it takes more like at least the white mage has like the hammer that does something.

354
00:24:54,752 --> 00:24:56,237
Rym: Hammers not that bad plus.

355
00:24:56,558 --> 00:24:57,220
Scott: It doesn't do.

356
00:24:57,261 --> 00:24:59,829
Scott: it doesn't do as much damage as like Silver Sword, but it works.

357
00:25:01,212 --> 00:25:03,442
Rym: Well the Thor's hammer, but anyway there you go.

358
00:25:03,462 --> 00:25:03,663
Scott: so

359
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:19,840
Rym: Final Fantasy was great and then a long long time later Final Fantasy 2 came out on the SNES and then 3 and Then 7 and then I found out oh wait a minute there was a real 2 3 4 5 6 And you know all that business that you should already know.

360
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,242
Rym: if you're.

361
00:25:20,282 --> 00:25:25,690
Scott: all these games have been remade Plenty of times for the PlayStation DS and GBA and everything.

362
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:30,510
Scott: But there was played them all by now, but in the tradition of messing with American gamers.

363
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:34,343
Rym: You know they took sick or they took four called it - they skipped five.

364
00:25:34,543 --> 00:25:35,486
Rym: they skipped two and three.

365
00:25:35,747 --> 00:25:39,825
Rym: they took six called it Three then they called seven seven for whatever inexplicable reason.

366
00:25:39,845 --> 00:25:40,830
Rym: they couldn't hide it anymore.

367
00:25:41,492 --> 00:25:42,033
Rym: But there were this.

368
00:25:42,294 --> 00:25:43,377
Rym: there were all these other games.

369
00:25:43,818 --> 00:25:49,435
Rym: there were Final Fantasy legend games on the Gameboy and Final Fantasy Adventure games.

370
00:25:49,475 --> 00:25:54,881
Rym: I think there were five in total legend 1 legend 2 legend 3 Adventure 1 adventure 2 and adventure 1.

371
00:25:54,881 --> 00:26:00,270
Scott: and adventure 2 were actually Saiken Densetsu games, which is Secret of Mana series.

372
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:01,756
Rym: See that's what I'm getting into.

373
00:26:01,836 --> 00:26:11,510
Rym: these games were called Final Fantasy in the US, but they were actually popular series from Japan Rebranded to sell to the American audience that knew and loved Final Fantasy.

374
00:26:11,851 --> 00:26:14,582
Scott: Yeah, we didn't have Secret of Mana yet, and they actually called it.

375
00:26:14,682 --> 00:26:18,609
Scott: You know they gave us Secret of Mana, which is They didn't call it Saiken Densetsu.

376
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:29,230
Rym: so they also reskinned a little bit to make the games look like Final Fantasy games, but Final Fantasy legend 2 and 1 and 3 were actually from a series saga.

377
00:26:29,752 --> 00:26:33,549
Rym: So Final Fantasy legend 2 is actually saga 2 the treasure legend?

378
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:34,895
Scott: well See this is something right.

379
00:26:34,935 --> 00:26:37,346
Scott: is that you look at say the GBA?

380
00:26:37,446 --> 00:26:43,850
Scott: right and the GBA Was sort of really good at doing NES games and sort of okay at doing Super Nintendo games, right?

381
00:26:44,432 --> 00:26:45,154
Scott: So what do they do?

382
00:26:45,495 --> 00:26:48,445
Scott: they didn't really make a lot of new games to the GBA.

383
00:26:48,465 --> 00:26:52,015
Scott: that did a lot of SNES Remakes and the DS.

384
00:26:52,036 --> 00:26:57,150
Scott: they're doing like n64 and SNES remakes and only a few new games, right?

385
00:26:57,270 --> 00:27:03,150
Scott: But for the original Gameboy it was sort of behind so they couldn't remake anything it for it.

386
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:15,096
Scott: So a lot of the GBA games were originals And there are a lot more originals in the original Gameboy than there are on any of the future portable systems that came after it because those got remakes of console games,

387
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:19,895
Rym: but Final Fantasy legend 2 is Memorable for many reasons.

388
00:27:20,116 --> 00:27:20,658
Rym: I mean one.

389
00:27:20,678 --> 00:27:23,850
Rym: it is a game where you know you have your theme music.

390
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:24,355
Rym: It's a fight.

391
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:25,770
Rym: It's a Final Fantasy ish game.

392
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,521
Rym: So your characters have a theme song the music.

393
00:27:27,601 --> 00:27:30,903
Scott: I just I hadn't heard it in so long But as soon as it started playing I was like oh fuck.

394
00:27:30,943 --> 00:27:31,970
Rym: Yeah, who did the music?

395
00:27:33,271 --> 00:27:34,054
Rym: No, no, boo.

396
00:27:34,195 --> 00:27:37,529
Rym: No, boo the same man who did the music for Final Fantasy.

397
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:55,825
Rym: so But this was a game where the bad guys are in a room plotting and I am eavesdropping and suddenly I'll start hearing my music like I'm the heroes and I think all right I'm gonna bust in the door and here we go We're gonna kick the bad guys asses and suddenly they look up and go what's that music?

398
00:27:56,226 --> 00:28:00,769
Rym: Oh shit the heroes are here Let's get the hell out and they empty the three treasure chests and leave.

399
00:28:01,852 --> 00:28:02,236
Rym: Damn it.

400
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,796
Rym: The game is hilarious I don't know.

401
00:28:05,098 --> 00:28:12,347
Rym: Maybe it won't stand up when I play it again But feast your eyes upon the first bits of this game and I point out that the mutants are sexy.

402
00:28:12,367 --> 00:28:13,310
Rym: The robots are awesome.

403
00:28:14,171 --> 00:28:17,388
Rym: Monsters are awesome, but not actually useful to play.

404
00:28:17,408 --> 00:28:17,770
Scott: I like them.

405
00:28:17,911 --> 00:28:21,330
Scott: I like all the Final Fantasy Gameboy games and I love the monsters.

406
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:26,670
Rym: The monsters are cool, but legend 2 has a special place in my heart and Apollo is a bastard.

407
00:28:27,633 --> 00:28:29,870
Scott: Oh and I like the boss of legend 3 Zagor.

408
00:28:31,432 --> 00:28:32,417
Scott: He's very Cthulhuoid.

409
00:28:32,438 --> 00:28:37,334
Scott: He's a big blob with a bunch of mouths Tentacles but a lot.

410
00:28:37,394 --> 00:28:42,970
Rym: I mean almost every square boss in the early Final Fantasy games was either some amorphous blob or something weird.

411
00:28:43,011 --> 00:28:43,456
Rym: He was a big

412
00:28:43,477 --> 00:28:53,530
Scott: blob with a bunch of tentacles right and like an eyeball and then you cut him up a bunch and when you like beat him up halfway like he would change And all these mouths would appear and then you would beat him up and then he would die

413
00:28:54,152 --> 00:28:55,990
Rym: Alright, so what do you got for me captain coffee?

414
00:28:56,975 --> 00:29:11,070
Scott: so This is game that's been you know Getting a lot of press around the the blogs and such called gravity bone and I saw it and I said I'm gonna play that Eventually, so I played it and it's an FPS little indie FPS, you know independently made.

415
00:29:11,892 --> 00:29:21,290
Scott: It takes about 10 minutes to play if you have any FPS skills, but actually even though it is very small It is so slick and so well designed.

416
00:29:21,351 --> 00:29:23,189
Scott: They're only like two minor flaws in it.

417
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:26,641
Scott: But one thing about the game is that it is executed.

418
00:29:26,662 --> 00:29:30,375
Scott: the chase scene like no other game I think I've ever played.

419
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:45,450
Scott: it actually has like an amazingly high quality chase scene and I Realized not a lot of other games just either completely bomb The chase scene or don't have them and I think a chase scene is something that gay would be really awesome in games.

420
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:48,239
Scott: It's really awesome in this one and this game is 10 minutes long.

421
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:54,760
Rym: I haven't played it yet, but on a scale of dino run Dino run dino runs a game.

422
00:29:54,961 --> 00:29:56,890
Scott: Well, I mean, it's not as long as dino run.

423
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:01,792
Scott: So you're gonna be done with this in like 10 minutes, but it's it's better than dino run I just want.

424
00:30:01,832 --> 00:30:04,020
Scott: but this isn't a chase where you're being chases.

425
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,325
Scott: chase where you're chasing something.

426
00:30:05,365 --> 00:30:05,907
Scott: It's completely.

427
00:30:05,967 --> 00:30:06,830
Scott: it's completely different.

428
00:30:07,432 --> 00:30:12,891
Scott: You know being chased by something a lot of games do actually but chasing after something else right.

429
00:30:13,293 --> 00:30:20,439
Scott: most games that do that either a the thing that you're chasing is sort of Programmed to stay a certain distance ahead of you.

430
00:30:20,459 --> 00:30:22,788
Scott: So it's sort of scripted right.

431
00:30:23,049 --> 00:30:29,027
Scott: or The thing just gets away from you unless you like do some incredible time run and it's annoying.

432
00:30:29,207 --> 00:30:36,390
Rym: or it's like a One of the a lot of 3d games will have where you have to chase an object or a guy But there's kind of the arrow and you just kind of follow the arrow, right?

433
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:37,635
Rym: It's not really a fun.

434
00:30:37,675 --> 00:30:37,816
Rym: what

435
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:55,286
Scott: this game does is it actually does do this scripted chase but you don't realize it because it's so well paced and such and You really feel like you're chasing it and trying to keep up with it and and you're you know It's not doesn't feel like a time trial, but it doesn't feel like a stupid scripted thing either.

436
00:30:55,467 --> 00:30:56,169
Scott: It's it's pretty good.

437
00:30:57,555 --> 00:30:58,650
Scott: So anyway, it's free play.

438
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:05,934
Rym: We over the weekend got together with the front row crew and we engaged in a gaming experiment.

439
00:31:06,356 --> 00:31:12,870
Scott: right so I was on Boeing Boeing and I saw this link to a Role-playing game an indie a free indie role-playing game.

440
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:21,530
Scott: a lot of people do these nowadays where you just download a PDF print it out and Congratulations, you've got a role-playing game right because a role-playing game just is just a book, right?

441
00:31:21,971 --> 00:31:27,370
Scott: You don't need you know, if you need stuff It's usually dice and pencils and character sheets all of which you can print.

442
00:31:27,491 --> 00:31:33,119
Scott: So there's no reason to actually need anything physical for a tabletop role-playing game As long as you got dice already.

443
00:31:33,582 --> 00:31:34,810
Scott: and this game didn't even need dice.

444
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:37,062
Scott: It needs nothing except the paper that you print out.

445
00:31:37,143 --> 00:31:41,020
Scott: So I'm like, hey This game looks pretty interesting.

446
00:31:41,542 --> 00:31:42,266
Scott: I'll print it out.

447
00:31:42,307 --> 00:31:42,870
Scott: Let's try it.

448
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:45,799
Scott: We need exactly eight people and we can only play it once.

449
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:49,590
Rym: now the title if nothing else get implied to me.

450
00:31:49,791 --> 00:31:51,769
Scott: I really like the time that this would be awesome.

451
00:31:51,911 --> 00:32:00,970
Scott: I mean the little engine that could Kill the little engine that could kill and I mean, I like the little engine that could so little engine that could kill.

452
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:01,833
Rym: I think I can.

453
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:02,615
Rym: I think I can.

454
00:32:02,635 --> 00:32:03,458
Rym: I think I can.

455
00:32:03,879 --> 00:32:14,364
Rym: yeah, it's like one of the best parts in Dumbo anyway, so But the deal with this game was that now don't worry if you're worried about spoilers There'll be a spoiler line in the show.

456
00:32:14,546 --> 00:32:14,727
Scott: Yeah.

457
00:32:14,747 --> 00:32:14,888
Scott: Yeah.

458
00:32:14,908 --> 00:32:14,989
Scott: Yeah.

459
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:21,990
Rym: So in case you actually want to play this yourself But don't we'll review it so you can make an informed decision as to whether or not you want this game.

460
00:32:22,331 --> 00:32:27,123
Scott: So the deal is it's a railroad murder mystery, you know Orient Express type action.

461
00:32:27,163 --> 00:32:29,610
Scott: So that's that's already plus points, right?

462
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:30,514
Scott: I love that action.

463
00:32:30,534 --> 00:32:31,860
Scott: who doesn't love that action.

464
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:33,568
Scott: I don't know anybody who doesn't.

465
00:32:33,749 --> 00:32:40,409
Rym: anyway I don't know anyone cool who doesn't like that Agatha Christie style all the way crazy elaborate murder mystery.

466
00:32:40,449 --> 00:32:45,146
Scott: Let's go Yep, so the way the game worked see I. the thing is you had.

467
00:32:45,206 --> 00:32:49,864
Scott: the game works like this There are eight characters and there are eight packets.

468
00:32:49,904 --> 00:33:05,190
Scott: you print out the eight packets right and you give a packet to each player and then everyone reads their packet and then When you're done reading the packet You're supposed to just know what to do and you'll roleplay and then come to the conclusion, right?

469
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:06,377
Rym: Think about that.

470
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:08,630
Rym: that isn't a very interesting idea.

471
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:14,166
Rym: This is something that games like Final Fantasy crystal chronicles used to.

472
00:33:14,307 --> 00:33:20,830
Rym: I mean to minor effect But the idea that you have a bunch of players who may have different information from one another.

473
00:33:21,211 --> 00:33:26,210
Rym: This takes it one step further in that all information is given individually to players.

474
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:29,930
Rym: So for all you know, the rules could have been different for different players.

475
00:33:30,211 --> 00:33:33,210
Rym: Yeah, you know your piece of paper might have said you're the murderer.

476
00:33:33,792 --> 00:33:35,037
Rym: Here are the things to lie about.

477
00:33:35,358 --> 00:33:36,001
Rym: here's the deal.

478
00:33:36,342 --> 00:33:38,330
Rym: it could have said everyone's the murderer.

479
00:33:39,176 --> 00:33:40,305
Rym: It could have told all the players.

480
00:33:40,325 --> 00:33:40,890
Rym: They're the murderer.

481
00:33:41,059 --> 00:33:42,229
Rym: Yeah Cuz I'm something crazy.

482
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:46,510
Scott: So the first the first page in the book is a cover that sort of hides everything from everyone else.

483
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:49,220
Scott: The second page is your rules right your personal rules.

484
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:52,030
Scott: So I got the rules for the conductor here, right?

485
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:52,956
Scott: And this is what they.

486
00:33:53,117 --> 00:33:54,627
Scott: I'm just gonna summarize them, right?

487
00:33:55,771 --> 00:33:57,588
Scott: Don't show your packet to anyone else.

488
00:33:58,531 --> 00:34:01,143
Scott: Don't read directly from your packet, you know.

489
00:34:01,264 --> 00:34:06,529
Scott: roleplay your character You know say I don't say my conductor my character, right?

490
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:12,827
Scott: If someone asks you a question and you and the answer isn't in the packet just make something up.

491
00:34:12,867 --> 00:34:13,549
Scott: that makes sense.

492
00:34:14,293 --> 00:34:16,382
Scott: This might be science fiction in the story.

493
00:34:16,625 --> 00:34:17,368
Scott: Just let it go.

494
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:24,590
Scott: Lie with caution because someone will catch you because a lot of the packets have you know corresponding information.

495
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:30,981
Scott: You may not lie about something you heard someone else, you know Some things you may not lie about and some things you may lie about.

496
00:34:31,021 --> 00:34:33,895
Scott: so the only thing there is you know You you.

497
00:34:33,915 --> 00:34:35,429
Scott: there's no GM for this game.

498
00:34:35,952 --> 00:34:42,522
Scott: So you have to sort of police yourself about the lying and the not lying, you know Because you don't know you have.

499
00:34:42,542 --> 00:34:43,830
Scott: these are your personal rule sheet.

500
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:46,924
Scott: Maybe someone else is allowed to lie about things or isn't?

501
00:34:46,964 --> 00:34:48,129
Scott: so no one else can police you.

502
00:34:48,693 --> 00:34:50,987
Scott: So you just had to sort of follow this rule sheet on your own.

503
00:34:51,772 --> 00:34:55,804
Rym: Plus I just like the idea that you have these eight secret pieces of information.

504
00:34:56,185 --> 00:35:02,590
Rym: you give them to eight people gaga And then theoretically at the end of that a game will emerge.

505
00:35:02,811 --> 00:35:06,770
Rym: I feel like this mechanic could be used to make a really really interesting game.

506
00:35:06,891 --> 00:35:10,190
Scott: It's like I didn't want to spoil the game cuz like if I hadn't read it in advance.

507
00:35:10,332 --> 00:35:11,768
Scott: I felt like that would sort of ruin it.

508
00:35:12,292 --> 00:35:15,710
Scott: So I sort of didn't read anything and I hand that out all the packets.

509
00:35:15,851 --> 00:35:20,649
Scott: I told everyone the the very minor amount of information I knew about the game and I said, alright, let's go.

510
00:35:21,151 --> 00:35:22,756
Scott: So everyone started reading right?

511
00:35:22,796 --> 00:35:26,307
Rym: So I'll kind of paraphrase my experience here again.

512
00:35:26,347 --> 00:35:26,909
Rym: No spoilers.

513
00:35:26,929 --> 00:35:27,290
Rym: Don't worry.

514
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:33,390
Scott: Well, the first problem right I think was that people read at different speeds and not all the packets were the same length.

515
00:35:33,691 --> 00:35:38,570
Rym: Yeah, so one packet was like 15 pages longer than mine was 12 pages, right?

516
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:44,150
Scott: So some people who read slow and got bigger packets didn't finish when we all started at the same time.

517
00:35:44,271 --> 00:35:51,349
Scott: So I guess that could be solved by everyone reading in advance And I guess that that could be good if you gave more lead time on it.

518
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:55,210
Scott: But I sort of like the everyone reading it at the same time thing that you know.

519
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:57,640
Scott: I think that really adds to the experience in a way.

520
00:35:57,841 --> 00:36:00,150
Rym: it did in a way because you see what happened.

521
00:36:00,632 --> 00:36:16,867
Scott: We're all sitting there reading our packets and after about 45 seconds someone in the room goes, huh, and then people would you know people just started having Reactions like they would giggle or they would go like what the fuck see that was.

522
00:36:16,927 --> 00:36:17,750
Rym: I was worried when?

523
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:22,669
Rym: After about a minute an unnamed person said what the fuck?

524
00:36:23,412 --> 00:36:27,876
Rym: Yeah, and then I look up and I'm like, all right and of course Having read mine.

525
00:36:27,996 --> 00:36:32,041
Scott: I was trying not to react but yes I didn't want to give anything away.

526
00:36:32,101 --> 00:36:33,169
Scott: that was on my secret sheet.

527
00:36:33,812 --> 00:36:34,756
Scott: I was trying not to.

528
00:36:34,896 --> 00:36:48,848
Rym: you know as other people started reacting it became impossible not to react Because I started to get the impression that perhaps the experience that everyone else was having Reading their packet was similar to my own.

529
00:36:48,868 --> 00:37:00,630
Scott: Yeah See everyone giggling was sort of making me not be able to focus so much so I went upstairs to read mine and That you know, I was able to actually pay attention to what I was reading more and that that didn't help.

530
00:37:01,105 --> 00:37:15,570
Rym: Yeah you see it got to a point where I looked up and I looked at everyone the crew and I said I Am NOT going to try to spoil anything for anyone But the word penis has appeared for the third time on the first page of my packet.

531
00:37:16,212 --> 00:37:17,717
Rym: How does anyone else feel about this?

532
00:37:17,898 --> 00:37:21,430
Scott: see mine had some nasty shit, but it didn't actually have the word penis.

533
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:26,025
Scott: So I was just like wow, I guess I don't have the worst one.

534
00:37:26,065 --> 00:37:27,630
Scott: The thing is mine was pretty bad.

535
00:37:27,911 --> 00:37:31,443
Rym: This is when someone suggested and I'm paraphrasing here Scott.

536
00:37:31,824 --> 00:37:33,470
Rym: Are you sure this is a game?

537
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:36,242
Rym: Are you sure this is not just a collective goatse?

538
00:37:36,262 --> 00:37:37,730
Rym: see that we have all been tricked into.

539
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:45,030
Scott: See that's the thing is at the one hand right you this is a game that sort of defies the demo, right?

540
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:46,737
Scott: It's like you have to just go for it.

541
00:37:46,857 --> 00:37:49,910
Scott: You can't, you know, test it before you try it, right?

542
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:51,436
Scott: Well, you can't try before you buy.

543
00:37:51,456 --> 00:37:53,545
Scott: you just got to buy otherwise you ruin it.

544
00:37:53,967 --> 00:37:57,550
Scott: if it was good I would have ruined it by reading the packets beforehand.

545
00:37:58,291 --> 00:38:03,948
Scott: But by not reading the packs beforehand I read them and then find out that they're all fucked up and crazy.

546
00:38:04,812 --> 00:38:07,230
Rym: So we're we're about to spoil.

547
00:38:07,571 --> 00:38:12,950
Rym: So if you really care you can stop listening in a second, but I will say this if you listen no further.

548
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:20,050
Rym: This game Terrible is not a word because it does not do how bad this is justice.

549
00:38:20,633 --> 00:38:24,130
Rym: This is an abomination to man and god.

550
00:38:24,331 --> 00:38:29,609
Scott: So basically the first problem I had right was that every character was despicable.

551
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:33,973
Scott: now There's nothing wrong with having a good end to a degree Disgusting.

552
00:38:34,033 --> 00:38:34,274
Scott: Yes.

553
00:38:34,314 --> 00:38:37,307
Scott: I mean there's nothing wrong with having a despicable disgusting character.

554
00:38:37,367 --> 00:38:38,412
Scott: in an RPG They can.

555
00:38:38,633 --> 00:38:46,663
Scott: they can be quite good right and in a murder mystery The murderer being despicable pretty good or in fact having a despicable person who's not the murderer?

556
00:38:47,064 --> 00:38:48,849
Scott: very good because that throws you off, right?

557
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:53,900
Scott: but Everyone hated their characters with a passion just about.

558
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:56,508
Scott: so I really my guy was a piece of shit.

559
00:38:56,588 --> 00:38:57,250
Scott: I was the conductor.

560
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:59,739
Scott: I was like, wow, this guy is terrible.

561
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,265
Scott: He's like the worst person.

562
00:39:01,285 --> 00:39:02,690
Scott: He's just disgusting.

563
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:05,370
Scott: It sounds like I don't really don't want to be this guy.

564
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:09,950
Scott: It made me feel bad reading about this guy because I was supposed to be him.

565
00:39:10,392 --> 00:39:13,649
Scott: Every time I put myself in his shoes, I was like, oh fuck get the hell away from me.

566
00:39:14,031 --> 00:39:21,693
Rym: So, I mean the best way to take you through my experience was I opened my packet and it starts out really strong because I was The violinist.

567
00:39:21,733 --> 00:39:25,104
Rym: it says you are the violinist and it gives me this basic information.

568
00:39:25,706 --> 00:39:34,870
Rym: on Wednesday, August 5th 1932 you and eight other passengers boarded a three-day express train from Bombay India to Lisbon, Portugal, Portugal.

569
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:38,596
Rym: Unfortunately One did not survive the journey.

570
00:39:39,038 --> 00:39:45,140
Rym: It is now up to you and the seven passengers left even though that's wrong To decide there are you and seven passengers?

571
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,670
Rym: Oh, yeah to decide who killed the eighth.

572
00:39:47,892 --> 00:39:54,328
Rym: No, you killed the ninth And then it tells me to read my backstory and all this and the next page is a map of the train.

573
00:39:54,428 --> 00:39:54,770
Rym: and I look.

574
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:56,697
Rym: And oh, I have my own quarters.

575
00:39:56,818 --> 00:39:59,970
Rym: All right, there's a peasant I see the Lord and the tennis star.

576
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:01,316
Rym: I see the staircases.

577
00:40:01,356 --> 00:40:02,239
Rym: There's the bar car.

578
00:40:02,259 --> 00:40:03,324
Rym: There's the cigar car.

579
00:40:03,645 --> 00:40:04,850
Rym: Here's where all the doors are.

580
00:40:05,512 --> 00:40:06,155
Rym: Alright, cool.

581
00:40:06,275 --> 00:40:10,510
Rym: I can dig this and I didn't know if I was a man or a woman or anything.

582
00:40:10,772 --> 00:40:11,879
Rym: I didn't know if that even mattered.

583
00:40:12,644 --> 00:40:21,169
Rym: I'm going to read the the first bit of my backstory and You will see right away where my problem begins.

584
00:40:22,431 --> 00:40:27,330
Rym: The leather of his shoe feels cold and wet likely due to too much shoe shine.

585
00:40:28,014 --> 00:40:30,450
Rym: You hate a man who uses too much shoe shine, but you smile.

586
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:45,285
Rym: Anyway, he rubs a shoe a little higher on your leg Alright and attempts to show you his pearly whites except they aren't pearly white and they barely make it out of these several layers Of chins that line the lower half of his face.

587
00:40:45,808 --> 00:40:54,569
Rym: Ah You shuffle your bar stool a few inches away leaving his shoe to drop despondently and disappear beneath the seam of his finely tailored chalk-striped slacks.

588
00:40:55,496 --> 00:40:57,630
Rym: He doesn't so much as break eye contact.

589
00:40:58,333 --> 00:41:03,847
Rym: You hate it when men look at you like that as if you were a prize to be purchased in one of their gala London auctions.

590
00:41:04,911 --> 00:41:05,455
Rym: Skip a bit.

591
00:41:05,495 --> 00:41:05,978
Rym: Skip a bit.

592
00:41:06,018 --> 00:41:06,541
Rym: Skip a bit.

593
00:41:06,561 --> 00:41:07,024
Rym: Skip a bit.

594
00:41:07,044 --> 00:41:07,467
Rym: Skip a bit.

595
00:41:07,487 --> 00:41:07,910
Rym: Skip a bit.

596
00:41:09,192 --> 00:41:12,489
Rym: You hate men, but you need money to get off this train.

597
00:41:13,294 --> 00:41:22,329
Rym: You let the businessman buy you a total of 11 martinis The minimum number required to numb your senses enough to tolerate a night in bed with an ogre like him.

598
00:41:22,449 --> 00:41:29,930
Rym: now You would think that it was going to skip past the night in bed with an ogre like him to the next morning when I murder him or whatever.

599
00:41:30,633 --> 00:41:34,770
Rym: But no, I know exactly how big this man's penis is.

600
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:43,976
Rym: In fact, it uses several analogies relating to avalanches of flesh surrounding tiny mine shafts with barely any silver to plumb It.

601
00:41:44,017 --> 00:41:54,664
Rym: the page informs me in no uncertain terms That I don't feel bad about the fact that he doesn't pay me in the end Because his penis was so small that I barely even felt it.

602
00:41:54,725 --> 00:41:56,029
Rym: It was hardly even any work.

603
00:41:58,292 --> 00:42:00,622
Rym: There are like 15 more pages of this.

604
00:42:01,184 --> 00:42:02,590
Scott: It's it's just disgusting.

605
00:42:03,172 --> 00:42:03,634
Rym: It was terrible.

606
00:42:03,694 --> 00:42:05,801
Scott: And the thing is right is my?

607
00:42:05,902 --> 00:42:07,166
Scott: my guy was the conductor right.

608
00:42:07,226 --> 00:42:09,093
Scott: basically it starts out We're like aha.

609
00:42:09,133 --> 00:42:11,020
Scott: He's secretly working for Scotland Yard.

610
00:42:11,302 --> 00:42:11,683
Scott: All right.

611
00:42:12,145 --> 00:42:13,470
Scott: He's a stickler for the law.

612
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:18,328
Scott: So he notices all these small legal infractions or pretty much anyone doing anything that's illegal.

613
00:42:18,348 --> 00:42:21,709
Scott: He's like, aha Alright, I'm like, okay, he's a little weirdo like that.

614
00:42:22,475 --> 00:42:34,366
Scott: The tennis star is like, you know super hottie with a giant rack and this guy is totally a perverted voyeur like sneaking in and taking photos of her and Shit, and then he like he wants to get rid of.

615
00:42:34,386 --> 00:42:44,569
Scott: you know he's pretty sure she's doing it with everyone on the train and she is except him and He wants to get rid of all those people so he can have the tennis star all to himself.

616
00:42:45,453 --> 00:42:46,175
Scott: It's just like.

617
00:42:46,557 --> 00:42:48,163
Scott: yes, he has no problem.

618
00:42:48,424 --> 00:42:51,095
Scott: Yeah, he's like, you know, you're like, aha He's an adulterer.

619
00:42:51,135 --> 00:42:51,839
Scott: So I'll get him.

620
00:42:52,121 --> 00:42:58,469
Scott: but he has no problem like Getting rid of these people in order to be perverted and lecherous.

621
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:07,182
Rym: but like my character the violinist is actually a sex slave in control of the peasant and the barman being sold at the end of this train ride.

622
00:43:07,202 --> 00:43:08,876
Rym: and The peasant.

623
00:43:09,198 --> 00:43:17,498
Rym: let me tell you about the peasant That like the description of his penis and Multiple characters get descriptions of his penis.

624
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:32,690
Rym: I believe the words were slug-like smelled like a mushroom that the smell of him is like a combination of urine and death and The smell is described in to the point that it is almost a ninth character, right?

625
00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:44,330
Scott: So I read the story and it's you know, it's just sort of perverted shit Right, and then eventually it gets to a point where the writing just like Collapses to where it makes no sense.

626
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:49,528
Scott: They all kind of do that every single care every single person complained of the same thing in their packet.

627
00:43:49,568 --> 00:43:59,226
Scott: Basically Everything just starts everything sort of going along sequentially and slowly right and then suddenly everything just collapses into an incomprehensible heap.

628
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:06,990
Scott: it's like you had hit over the head and then you're in a closet and then you see something and then you smell something and Something else and then there's no transitions.

629
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:13,589
Scott: everything is rapid fire and nonsensical and you have to just read it incredibly slowly and even then it doesn't make sense.

630
00:44:13,789 --> 00:44:26,470
Scott: and You know, I guess the point of the game is that everyone is supposed to take these rapid-fire nonsensical bits at the end of their packet and sort of combine them to figure out who the murderer was.

631
00:44:27,052 --> 00:44:29,300
Scott: You know like oh, well, you smelled that thing.

632
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:31,830
Scott: Well, I saw that thing and smelled it.

633
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:34,577
Rym: Details of you, you know, I had sex.

634
00:44:34,657 --> 00:44:36,684
Rym: I look up the clock said 445.

635
00:44:36,684 --> 00:44:37,768
Rym: I walk outside.

636
00:44:37,848 --> 00:44:38,410
Rym: I hear a noise.

637
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:41,362
Rym: I see this I do that description of the peasants penis again.

638
00:44:41,382 --> 00:44:42,205
Rym: I go here.

639
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:43,450
Rym: I see these people I look up.

640
00:44:43,731 --> 00:44:44,192
Rym: It's now 515.

641
00:44:44,192 --> 00:44:45,477
Rym: I walk over here.

642
00:44:45,558 --> 00:44:56,156
Rym: I do this and the writing just got like crazier and crazier and There were gems throughout mind like eventually I find the abortion pills Which I also found the abortion bill.

643
00:44:56,236 --> 00:45:02,658
Rym: everyone finds the abortion pills or steals them or whatever and it just so happens that if you take One you get an abortion.

644
00:45:02,698 --> 00:45:04,065
Rym: if you take two you die.

645
00:45:05,672 --> 00:45:06,254
Scott: That's great.

646
00:45:06,555 --> 00:45:16,066
Rym: And they're described in mine as quote the candy of the feminist movements unquote awesome brilliant brilliant.

647
00:45:18,054 --> 00:45:28,585
Rym: It turns that basically the barman the guy behind this sex slave selling business And the bags all Catholic who's working with them.

648
00:45:29,027 --> 00:45:29,730
Rym: it all comes together.

649
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:42,816
Rym: I really felt bad for Adam who played the Lord because apparently the Lord is Crazy and has like a war flashback and like the last eight pages of his is a nonsensical acid trip.

650
00:45:42,916 --> 00:45:44,909
Rym: flashback through the war.

651
00:45:45,732 --> 00:45:48,139
Rym: Great, it has nothing to do with well know that it.

652
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:51,830
Scott: obviously it has parallels to the same trips that everyone else is having.

653
00:45:52,912 --> 00:45:58,251
Rym: And then at the end you were presented as a player with the most contrived Situation.

654
00:45:58,533 --> 00:46:00,281
Scott: this is this is what really ruined it.

655
00:46:00,301 --> 00:46:02,210
Scott: when I read I mean it was already ruined.

656
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:07,930
Scott: But when I read this I was like, oh wow That is it's like I knew that somehow and we got to the end of the packets.

657
00:46:08,253 --> 00:46:09,361
Scott: We would know what to do.

658
00:46:09,422 --> 00:46:10,329
Scott: because think about it, right?

659
00:46:10,951 --> 00:46:11,815
Scott: It's a murder mystery.

660
00:46:11,856 --> 00:46:14,530
Scott: now think about other murder mysteries like say clue, right?

661
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:16,878
Scott: There's a little envelope that has the answer in it.

662
00:46:16,918 --> 00:46:17,721
Scott: Well in this game.

663
00:46:18,002 --> 00:46:18,986
Scott: There is no answer.

664
00:46:19,047 --> 00:46:20,633
Scott: There is no GM There's no nothing.

665
00:46:20,673 --> 00:46:24,710
Scott: It's just eight people with packets and the answer is supposed to come out somehow.

666
00:46:24,871 --> 00:46:28,888
Scott: So there has to be some rules for when is it over etc, etc.

667
00:46:29,571 --> 00:46:32,210
Scott: So I figured that would be at the end of the packet and I was right.

668
00:46:32,691 --> 00:46:37,026
Scott: But what it was at the end of the packet was like the topper.

669
00:46:37,086 --> 00:46:41,400
Scott: it was like it was already poop But this was like poop on the poop eyes.

670
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:44,450
Scott: It was the cherry on the diarrhea on the dog.

671
00:46:44,612 --> 00:46:46,290
Rym: I really have to read this to you verbatim.

672
00:46:46,491 --> 00:46:47,213
Rym: Yeah, you do.

673
00:46:47,293 --> 00:46:48,717
Rym: it is so contrived.

674
00:46:48,777 --> 00:46:54,430
Rym: and the worst part is I thought I was the murderer because I'd looked like I killed the Guy, well, you got to read the final page.

675
00:46:54,871 --> 00:47:00,528
Rym: A lot of people thought they were the murderer except the magician whose package said you are the murderer.

676
00:47:00,548 --> 00:47:01,070
Scott: did it really?

677
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:06,187
Rym: Yeah, basically, okay, but finally basically the gender arms of France appear.

678
00:47:06,548 --> 00:47:06,970
Rym: eventually.

679
00:47:07,111 --> 00:47:08,014
Scott: Those are French police.

680
00:47:08,054 --> 00:47:09,018
Scott: Someone actually didn't know.

681
00:47:09,439 --> 00:47:09,881
Rym: I forget who.

682
00:47:10,142 --> 00:47:11,226
Rym: actually a few people didn't know.

683
00:47:11,406 --> 00:47:17,018
Rym: Okay, I was surprised But you get around and they say all right They arrest everyone and they pull the dead body out.

684
00:47:17,098 --> 00:47:20,030
Rym: and they it says the following the gender arm speaks.

685
00:47:20,592 --> 00:47:24,930
Rym: He says that France has found judges to be corrupt and juries to be inept.

686
00:47:25,573 --> 00:47:32,584
Rym: Justice is becoming through the French as impossible ideal to on it unable to be implemented from the crooked benches of its more crooked courts.

687
00:47:32,885 --> 00:47:35,634
Rym: the writing by the way is Awful to see you now.

688
00:47:35,895 --> 00:47:40,330
Rym: if you haven't noticed the country has loved justice in the hands of you eight passengers.

689
00:47:40,955 --> 00:47:42,890
Rym: It is your duty to reach a verdict.

690
00:47:43,595 --> 00:47:45,629
Rym: It is your duty to make France proud again.

691
00:47:46,313 --> 00:47:49,409
Rym: a vote can be taken at any time in secret or by a show of hands.

692
00:47:49,429 --> 00:47:54,949
Rym: in Order to reach a verdict the voter conviction must be no more than one shy of unanimity.

693
00:47:55,611 --> 00:48:02,750
Rym: France will only accept one guilty party and that guilty party must be sitting at this table right now must be alive.

694
00:48:03,433 --> 00:48:06,609
Rym: Anything less will reflect shame and dishonor upon the good people of France.

695
00:48:07,492 --> 00:48:18,304
Rym: Upon the arrival of an acceptable verdict the murderer will be swiftly and the gender arms assure you Brutally disposed of the decision before each of you is a simple interrogative.

696
00:48:18,806 --> 00:48:20,089
Rym: who killed the barman?

697
00:48:22,071 --> 00:48:23,115
Rym: Now here's the thing.

698
00:48:23,215 --> 00:48:29,597
Scott: how contrived is that it's so good and we Didn't even roleplay.

699
00:48:29,818 --> 00:48:31,586
Rym: We all looked at you were like just like fuck this.

700
00:48:31,607 --> 00:48:32,290
Scott: We're not role-playing.

701
00:48:32,611 --> 00:48:36,802
Rym: Proposed the following the peasant is a piece of shit.

702
00:48:37,043 --> 00:48:38,386
Rym: who sells women as sex?

703
00:48:38,547 --> 00:48:39,710
Scott: everyone is a piece of shit.

704
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:47,170
Rym: But the peasant was the biggest piece of shit regardless of guilt I knew particularly because my character was the least piece of shit.

705
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:53,523
Rym: the worst I did was try to murder the barman who deserved it and I kicked the magician in the balls twice.

706
00:48:53,563 --> 00:49:00,568
Scott: my guy was a piece of shit but not a bigger piece of shit as say the businessman or Oh my god the business then.

707
00:49:01,454 --> 00:49:04,550
Rym: Okay, it was hilarious cuz apparently he is crazy.

708
00:49:04,951 --> 00:49:11,150
Rym: He just he thinks like capitalism is the rule of the world and he's just thinking about capitalism all the time.

709
00:49:11,311 --> 00:49:13,385
Scott: Yeah, he's just like oh you got me there.

710
00:49:13,425 --> 00:49:14,190
Scott: He's like the computer.

711
00:49:15,113 --> 00:49:17,028
Rym: It's so crazy like oh my god.

712
00:49:17,531 --> 00:49:21,710
Rym: But I proposed the peasant is the biggest piece piece of shit of everyone.

713
00:49:22,433 --> 00:49:22,734
Rym: I vote.

714
00:49:22,754 --> 00:49:24,401
Rym: we all just say he did it and that's the end.

715
00:49:24,863 --> 00:49:29,098
Scott: and everyone said yes Mostly because they wanted the game to end.

716
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:30,803
Rym: it wasn't even a game.

717
00:49:31,084 --> 00:49:31,585
Rym: It's not like.

718
00:49:31,625 --> 00:49:33,130
Rym: it set up a role-playing situation.

719
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:45,230
Rym: It was basically a bunch of gibberish that gave you a bunch of information and then a really really weak Logic puzzle at the end where theoretically you would like try to trip other players off because you know information and lie

720
00:49:45,411 --> 00:49:48,130
Scott: Because you theoretically right it's got the the fear.

721
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:56,780
Scott: You know the idea was that on the one hand you're trying to share information to figure out who the real murderer is and solve The puzzle but on the other hand you never.

722
00:49:56,961 --> 00:50:02,114
Scott: if people are starting to decide that maybe it's you You don't want that to be true Even if it is true.

723
00:50:02,516 --> 00:50:06,090
Scott: and the actual Mert, you know, you can lie about some things and not others.

724
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:06,411
Scott: I don't.

725
00:50:06,431 --> 00:50:07,175
Scott: you know and such.

726
00:50:07,737 --> 00:50:10,429
Scott: so you're you this tripping up other people as well.

727
00:50:11,192 --> 00:50:16,250
Rym: But it was so poorly written so contrived so poorly implemented.

728
00:50:16,391 --> 00:50:17,414
Rym: The writing was like.

729
00:50:17,816 --> 00:50:21,469
Rym: I don't think you understand how bad the writing is.

730
00:50:22,032 --> 00:50:22,373
Scott: Worst.

731
00:50:22,554 --> 00:50:26,369
Rym: I've seen fanfics that were much more well-written than this.

732
00:50:28,131 --> 00:50:32,650
Scott: This is one of the worst fanfics ever basically, but it's not a fan of anything.

733
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:34,016
Rym: I don't think it was actually a game.

734
00:50:34,076 --> 00:50:38,814
Rym: I think whoever made it just wanted to trick eight people into reading the Pornography.

735
00:50:38,995 --> 00:50:40,806
Scott: the price is too high.

736
00:50:41,067 --> 00:50:41,530
Scott: It's free.

737
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:46,170
Rym: They should have paid people to play it because even then my time is worth more than that.

738
00:50:46,351 --> 00:50:51,630
Scott: I've noticed this though, right the problem this game has I've noticed with some other indie games, right?

739
00:50:51,891 --> 00:50:56,050
Scott: It's that it has some clever idea at the core, right?

740
00:50:56,130 --> 00:51:02,970
Scott: The actual premise is everyone reads something and then everyone role-plays and it could be that could work that mechanic, right?

741
00:51:03,592 --> 00:51:10,874
Scott: But the actual fundamentals, you know good writing Non-contrived Situation etc.

742
00:51:10,895 --> 00:51:11,357
Scott: Etc.

743
00:51:11,698 --> 00:51:12,924
Scott: They fail on all of those.

744
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:14,150
Scott: look at dwarf fortress, right?

745
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:28,469
Scott: Really clever core idea dwarf sim with emergent, you know story Problem all the fundamentals of user interface and playability and all those things Complete fail, right?

746
00:51:29,852 --> 00:51:38,141
Scott: You know and there's lots and lots of other indie games, you know of all sorts tabletop You know and video that sort of have the same problem.

747
00:51:38,181 --> 00:51:39,625
Rym: Well, that's multi winia.

748
00:51:40,027 --> 00:51:41,110
Rym: The concept was great.

749
00:51:41,391 --> 00:51:45,689
Rym: yeah game looked cool, but you can't change your controls and some of the networking doesn't work.

750
00:51:45,709 --> 00:51:48,603
Rym: and Alright games already ruined.

751
00:51:48,644 --> 00:51:49,430
Rym: I can't change the control.

752
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:56,438
Scott: It's like they made this RTS with the idea of the RTS was good, but they failed to do something that Fundamentally every PC game needs.

753
00:51:56,519 --> 00:52:12,919
Scott: I can't change configurable controls And networking that works and even if the networking it worked the controls Yeah, two fundamental basic things and you know, if you look at like professionally made games Professionally made games aren't perfect.

754
00:52:12,939 --> 00:52:18,326
Scott: They also often fail at the fundamentals But they fail at the fundamentals.

755
00:52:18,407 --> 00:52:24,227
Scott: less and Usually most professionally made games have all the fundamentals just right.

756
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:25,090
Scott: the games work.

757
00:52:25,411 --> 00:52:27,236
Scott: They're bug free for the most part.

758
00:52:27,277 --> 00:52:30,166
Scott: They have configurable controls for the most part, right?

759
00:52:30,607 --> 00:52:33,576
Scott: Not so many glitches But they have no core concept.

760
00:52:33,596 --> 00:52:34,198
Scott: That's any good.

761
00:52:34,238 --> 00:52:35,682
Scott: They're like cookie cutter crap.

762
00:52:35,783 --> 00:52:38,049
Scott: It's just just another FPS just another RTS.

763
00:52:38,591 --> 00:52:40,501
Scott: No clever idea nothing interesting.

764
00:52:40,822 --> 00:52:42,450
Scott: just you know a cookie cutter.

765
00:52:42,932 --> 00:52:44,861
Scott: We have the basics right, but we don't have anything else.

766
00:52:44,881 --> 00:52:50,210
Rym: but then in a situation like this or with multi win Yeah, or of course exceptions on all sides, you know, but yes.

767
00:52:50,471 --> 00:52:53,078
Rym: But we have a lot of indie games where it's the exact opposite.

768
00:52:53,118 --> 00:52:56,889
Rym: great idea terrible implementation still not worthwhile as a result.

769
00:52:57,129 --> 00:52:58,676
Rym: Yep Yep, but like.

770
00:52:58,796 --> 00:53:06,490
Rym: if you wanted me to go into these specifics as to why this game was bad I mean the characters had no like if you really role-played it out Really?

771
00:53:07,171 --> 00:53:17,950
Rym: It's just going to come down to the peasant being executed in the end because no player has any Motivation other than to not be implicated and they'll all just gang up on someone in the peasants.

772
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:18,875
Rym: The easiest one to game up.

773
00:53:18,895 --> 00:53:21,548
Rym: gang up on because he was friends with the bar man.

774
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:23,634
Rym: Yep, who is dead?

775
00:53:24,016 --> 00:53:26,104
Rym: Yep, and you don't have to prove they did it.

776
00:53:26,164 --> 00:53:26,907
Rym: You just have to vote.

777
00:53:27,228 --> 00:53:27,790
Rym: That's the rule.

778
00:53:27,931 --> 00:53:28,493
Rym: So that's that.

779
00:53:28,754 --> 00:53:29,356
Rym: that's what we did.

780
00:53:29,396 --> 00:53:30,420
Scott: Yeah, who cares?

781
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,005
Scott: who cares who really did it?

782
00:53:32,066 --> 00:53:34,113
Scott: That's you know, I mean Theoretically.

783
00:53:34,193 --> 00:53:40,053
Scott: my guy cares who really did it because he's also from Scotland Yard and is you know pretending to be a conductor You know.

784
00:53:41,333 --> 00:53:45,416
Scott: But it's such a blur that out of you know The meta fails to.

785
00:53:45,978 --> 00:53:49,630
Rym: most of the interesting role-playing that could have happened would have been in playing out the scenario.

786
00:53:50,052 --> 00:53:54,470
Rym: Instead the whole scenario already played out and you're just analyzing it.

787
00:53:54,490 --> 00:54:00,427
Scott: There's very little left to do and what you're analyzing right is such a mess that you just don't.

788
00:54:00,587 --> 00:54:01,490
Scott: it's just a chore.

789
00:54:01,851 --> 00:54:02,635
Rym: The writing was bad.

790
00:54:02,695 --> 00:54:06,150
Rym: The details were too numerous and too useless and even a little inconsistent.

791
00:54:06,712 --> 00:54:08,959
Rym: There was no like bullet-pointed list of.

792
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:12,130
Rym: you know, these people, you know these facts.

793
00:54:12,932 --> 00:54:14,710
Rym: You know, it was just like this.

794
00:54:14,810 --> 00:54:14,911
Rym: but

795
00:54:14,931 --> 00:54:27,723
Scott: thing is I feel like if you did that the bullet-pointed list that it would be too simple to figure out who did it and You would just you would you know rapidly maybe within 10-15 minutes Figure out who did it based on all those bullet points and then it'll be over.

796
00:54:28,044 --> 00:54:29,690
Rym: but at the same time the bullet points.

797
00:54:30,352 --> 00:54:38,581
Rym: If you made the game to where there you had motivations other than something so simple and pathetic at the end The character is definitely not much motivation going on.

798
00:54:38,601 --> 00:54:40,530
Scott: I mean my character's main motivation, right?

799
00:54:40,870 --> 00:54:42,710
Scott: It started out where he had dual motivations.

800
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:46,664
Scott: He had the hots for the tennis star, but also he was working for Scotland Yard.

801
00:54:46,684 --> 00:54:49,834
Scott: He was investigating something for reals Very quickly.

802
00:54:49,895 --> 00:54:53,350
Scott: as I read on he mostly just cared about getting in the pants of the tennis star.

803
00:54:54,193 --> 00:54:57,627
Scott: I was not motivated to do that and that really didn't play into.

804
00:54:57,647 --> 00:55:10,930
Scott: you know Choosing who was gonna get it except for maybe I wouldn't vote for the tennis star because I want her to live and maybe I Would definitely vote for people who you know She was getting with that way I'd get them out of the way and make it easier for me to get with her.

805
00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:13,941
Scott: But other than that the motivation didn't play into it at all.

806
00:55:14,182 --> 00:55:24,157
Rym: The characters were so one-dimensional It was painful like a bird an NPC and burning wheel that I roll up for one session is More multi-dimensional than these characters.

807
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:26,745
Rym: Yeah, I mean no beliefs.

808
00:55:27,046 --> 00:55:27,648
Rym: No instincts.

809
00:55:27,749 --> 00:55:29,294
Rym: No traits No driving forces.

810
00:55:29,635 --> 00:55:30,639
Rym: so simplistic.

811
00:55:30,899 --> 00:55:33,910
Rym: and again the writing the writing the writing.

812
00:55:34,111 --> 00:55:38,390
Scott: I feel like if you got a good writer, like let's say, you know Neil Gaiman made one of these.

813
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:41,819
Scott: It could be wicked awesome, but this this one is ass.

814
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,805
Scott: This is the title was wasted on.

815
00:55:43,925 --> 00:55:53,075
Rym: it takes one of those like do the murder mystery over dinner boxes that you can buy in like gaming stores and Removes everything fun about.

816
00:55:53,136 --> 00:56:02,326
Rym: it removes the play out the murder part has a trivial Contrived piece of crap at the end and it takes so much investment in reading that it's pathetic.

817
00:56:02,547 --> 00:56:03,670
Rym: This needs to be burned.

818
00:56:03,891 --> 00:56:05,677
Rym: I'm sorry, whoever it is who wrote it.

819
00:56:05,798 --> 00:56:07,183
Scott: It's a free PDF though.

820
00:56:07,203 --> 00:56:09,190
Scott: So I mean really but can we complain?

821
00:56:09,291 --> 00:56:13,077
Scott: Yes, because he wasted time on it But you should not waste time on this.

822
00:56:13,117 --> 00:56:17,110
Rym: do not play this download it and read it to see how bad it is.

823
00:56:17,351 --> 00:56:19,188
Rym: But seriously do not play it.

824
00:56:19,370 --> 00:56:19,892
Scott: Yeah, I don't.

825
00:56:19,932 --> 00:56:24,710
Scott: a lot of people out there have trouble getting RPG groups just to play like D&D, you know.

826
00:56:24,770 --> 00:56:28,692
Scott: So I don't think too many people out there can get eight, you know people together for this I got.

827
00:56:28,732 --> 00:56:33,049
Rym: I mean everybody is inside everyone else's wife fucking everybody and everybody's room.

828
00:56:33,655 --> 00:56:35,353
Rym: Okay, back door fucking fish I think.

829
00:56:35,474 --> 00:56:44,221
Scott: I think though I am gonna try to you know Play like a one shot of a different RPG every month or so And I think next time I'm gonna do the the mouse guard RPG.

830
00:56:44,281 --> 00:56:45,847
Rym: So, you know what we're reading them.

831
00:56:45,928 --> 00:56:47,212
Rym: from now on I don't care.

832
00:56:47,955 --> 00:56:52,170
Scott: Well, you're not I'm not gonna do any more that are secret like this.

833
00:56:52,190 --> 00:57:02,089
Scott: You know, the mouse guard RPG is just burning wheel with mouse guard on it So that shouldn't be a problem, but this needs to be burned and I think we can end on that.

834
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:11,452
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
