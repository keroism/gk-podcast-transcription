1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,168
Rym: It's Monday April 20th.

2
00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:11,791
Scott: I'm ready.

3
00:00:11,831 --> 00:00:13,599
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:16,860
Rym: tonight We have kind of a long show about to open everything, New York City.

5
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:26,927
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,861 --> 00:00:33,232
Rym: Well, I'm back down to one Red Bull a day.

7
00:00:33,252 --> 00:00:43,031
Scott: I think that's still possibly Not one too many, but perhaps like one 7 like 6/7 too many.

8
00:00:43,051 --> 00:00:44,980
Scott: like what a week is maybe okay, really?

9
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:55,531
Rym: I'm averaging like five a week, and then my other caffeinated beverages are coffee in as opposed to I don't know a chemical a Performance enhancing chemical you know you can.

10
00:00:55,792 --> 00:00:57,840
Scott: you know what I would do if I had like an an office?

11
00:00:58,402 --> 00:01:07,112
Scott: Right what I would do is I would get like some caffeine like in a you know like just you know powdered caffeine and like A little you know like a spice jar or whatever.

12
00:01:07,132 --> 00:01:08,800
Scott: right and then I would make decaf.

13
00:01:08,921 --> 00:01:10,900
Scott: You know there'd be a coffee maker in the office.

14
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,320
Scott: You sort of have to have one and I would get caffeine free right?

15
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:18,827
Scott: But I would put it in a not in a caffeine box So people wouldn't think it was caffeine free.

16
00:01:18,847 --> 00:01:24,814
Scott: and then I what I would do is I would put the caffeine in there from the Little medicine you know from the spice box, so it would.

17
00:01:24,874 --> 00:01:25,960
Scott: there would be caffeine in there.

18
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:33,118
Scott: So you know every every week your employees every week I would put in less and less and less until we had this bot.

19
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:41,898
Scott: You know that we would have a can of you know caffeinated coffee that had caffeine free coffee in it And then no one in the office would get any caffeine, but they wouldn't know it.

20
00:01:42,807 --> 00:01:43,718
Rym: Why would you do that?

21
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,287
Scott: Get my office off caffeine, but why?

22
00:01:46,347 --> 00:01:47,572
Rym: caffeine is good for you?

23
00:01:47,592 --> 00:01:49,379
Rym: all those slashdot articles have been pointing that out.

24
00:01:49,419 --> 00:01:54,909
Scott: it It's like alcohol alcohol, it's like yeah heart disease.

25
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:56,414
Scott: this was like all cancer.

26
00:01:56,474 --> 00:02:00,344
Rym: that it's all I think Is in terms of.

27
00:02:00,405 --> 00:02:02,794
Rym: you have to have intelligent moderation in all things.

28
00:02:03,215 --> 00:02:04,360
Rym: yeah, and few people do that.

29
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,312
Scott: I mean I mean if you drink too much water you die.

30
00:02:07,332 --> 00:02:14,797
Rym: don't eat too much bread you die, but I mean All right, there's a strong correlation between drinking red wine and not having a heart attack.

31
00:02:15,238 --> 00:02:21,485
Rym: at the same time There's a strong correlation from drinking red wine and being a wino The mad dog.

32
00:02:21,646 --> 00:02:27,308
Scott: I think the thing my night train the thing is I'm saying is that You know there are some things out there.

33
00:02:27,508 --> 00:02:28,853
Scott: We're a little bit is too much.

34
00:02:29,374 --> 00:02:31,180
Rym: You know like a heroin crack.

35
00:02:31,381 --> 00:02:34,475
Scott: We all agree yeah, right, but there's nothing out there.

36
00:02:34,636 --> 00:02:42,299
Scott: Where zero is Not is no good Except you know just food in general your regular food zero food is bad.

37
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:44,110
Rym: wait You're saying there's nothing out there.

38
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,459
Scott: was your water is also bad.

39
00:02:49,164 --> 00:02:59,818
Rym: But at least the thing I was trying to do this was it wasn't like oh I should not drink caffeine or anything because I drink caffeine and all these sorts of things all the time and I use them for runs and energy and all that.

40
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:03,391
Rym: but My thinking was more that the more tolerance.

41
00:03:03,471 --> 00:03:10,040
Rym: I build up much like I've already done with alcohol The less effective it is and the more I have to drink which increases.

42
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:14,000
Rym: You know it's like the drug addict - he does his cocaine or whatever and he's fine.

43
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:18,766
Rym: But then he has to keep using more and more of it to get the same effect And he has more and more of the side effects.

44
00:03:18,847 --> 00:03:20,534
Rym: and about a month ago.

45
00:03:20,554 --> 00:03:25,145
Rym: I was starting to get that with my caffeine Mm-hmm, and I Got down.

46
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:27,197
Rym: until now it is one caffeinated bet.

47
00:03:27,237 --> 00:03:30,730
Rym: well one Substantially caffeinated beverage per day.

48
00:03:31,031 --> 00:03:32,419
Rym: I don't count like a can of coke.

49
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,311
Scott: Yeah, I guess isn't there technically caffeine.

50
00:03:36,331 --> 00:03:38,700
Scott: and just like regular old chocolate yes, yeah.

51
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,812
Scott: So it's like I get caffeine in there.

52
00:03:40,993 --> 00:03:45,593
Rym: I guess cuz I eat chocolate But you know yeah, but I remember when I first drank Red Bull.

53
00:03:45,613 --> 00:03:53,759
Rym: you drink it and get this rush and all right I gotta go do stuff go go go puff puff puff 180 miles an hour And it got to the point where I drink a Red Bull just to not fall asleep.

54
00:03:55,404 --> 00:04:01,720
Scott: The main thing I think about Red Bull though It's like they have like this great great marketing where they like they advertise.

55
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,428
Scott: I'm like all this awesome shit, and it's never like.

56
00:04:04,448 --> 00:04:20,017
Scott: it's always like awesome sports stuff like f1 car f1 cars, right They got like four f1 cars Video of like the greatest Skydiving base jump guy in the world and pretty much Red Bull sponsored everything he did.

57
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,787
Rym: yep Well plus look at how they got everything started.

58
00:04:22,807 --> 00:04:32,480
Rym: their early marketing campaigns was they go to colleges and trendy places and be like All the Red Bull you want have go nuts yeah, or the beach, or you know surfing and you know anything cool like that.

59
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:38,727
Rym: And of course the first frat boy thinks huh new thing caffeinated Makes it with vodka.

60
00:04:38,948 --> 00:04:39,490
Scott: Oh, yeah, baby.

61
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:42,099
Scott: It's like regardless of the beverage itself, right?

62
00:04:42,881 --> 00:04:48,720
Scott: It's all the money that is paid for that makes all these awesome things happen cuz you know when you're wait wait wait.

63
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,293
Rym: So are you saying that drinking Red Bull is basically charity for extreme sports?

64
00:04:53,353 --> 00:04:55,780
Scott: Yes, it is right cuz you think about it, right?

65
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,411
Scott: I mean those things like thanks skydiving.

66
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,520
Scott: dude right he needs like all this equipment.

67
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,586
Scott: He needs planes.

68
00:05:01,647 --> 00:05:02,190
Scott: you need you know.

69
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:02,955
Scott: think about how much shit.

70
00:05:02,975 --> 00:05:03,277
Scott: He needs.

71
00:05:03,297 --> 00:05:06,186
Rym: you're not gonna get Stanley to back him.

72
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:13,559
Scott: no one would ever pay for that right, but the thing is look at other people out there Who get ever like coca-cola advertising right when you buy a can of coke?

73
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,969
Scott: They spend their money on a billboard a TV ad.

74
00:05:16,989 --> 00:05:19,016
Scott: that doesn't really you know.

75
00:05:19,116 --> 00:05:20,400
Scott: do anything at least you know.

76
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,469
Scott: I mean they could use the money to like.

77
00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:22,810
Scott: you know.

78
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:25,020
Scott: maybe do some chair real charitable work.

79
00:05:25,221 --> 00:05:26,606
Scott: You know saving starving people.

80
00:05:26,647 --> 00:05:29,439
Scott: they do yeah, well, but you know it.

81
00:05:30,562 --> 00:05:36,500
Scott: Paying for a guy to do awesome Skydiving is better than paying for a billboard in Times Square McDonald's and Burger King and all those things.

82
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:40,540
Rym: I mean there's always those logos all over f1 cars or all their different things.

83
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,815
Rym: But Red Bull I feel like kind of goes out of its way to go after the more awesome stuff.

84
00:05:45,177 --> 00:05:46,140
Scott: Yeah anyway.

85
00:05:46,803 --> 00:05:49,699
Rym: So so I'm performing a charitable world service here.

86
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,385
Scott: Somewhat charitable.

87
00:05:51,525 --> 00:05:58,900
Scott: it has it as charitable intent, but it is not going to the Greatest charitable cause there is no no it's not.

88
00:05:59,482 --> 00:06:08,880
Rym: But you know yeah that kind of comes in stark contrast after our weekend because we kind of we didn't even really announce it on the show because we went Suddenly, and we've registered at the last minute.

89
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:16,656
Rym: But we went to open everything New York City 2009 over the weekend and part of the reason this whole caffeine thing came up Was that I was very like?

90
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:24,175
Rym: Methodically Reducing my caffeine and energy drink input And I was like planning and getting down to the one drink a day.

91
00:06:24,195 --> 00:06:28,700
Rym: and we're at this thing And I'm giving all these talks, and I'm kind of tired and I want some caffeine.

92
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,760
Rym: I go get my one latte, and it was like that went to a non Starbucks over by the UN.

93
00:06:33,921 --> 00:06:34,964
Rym: It was like the best latte.

94
00:06:34,984 --> 00:06:38,396
Rym: I've ever had in my life, so I went and got another gigantic one.

95
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:38,456
Scott: No.

96
00:06:38,837 --> 00:06:47,686
Rym: That's a good job But we'll talk about that in the second half of the show because what The right before like.

97
00:06:47,706 --> 00:06:49,934
Rym: we're both going out of town for an extended period.

98
00:06:49,974 --> 00:06:51,760
Rym: we weren't even gonna do a show today.

99
00:06:51,961 --> 00:06:55,673
Scott: Well, we were gonna do a show today because originally right I was gonna drive you.

100
00:06:56,095 --> 00:07:00,099
Scott: you're going to Costa Rica tomorrow And I was gonna drive you to the airport tomorrow.

101
00:07:00,763 --> 00:07:06,899
Scott: Mom calls me yesterday right and I was sort of planning to go to Florida But we didn't know when and we were kind of like we'll go.

102
00:07:07,821 --> 00:07:09,688
Rym: She's like we're going tomorrow.

103
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,274
Scott: It's like Tuesday, and I'm like Tuesday.

104
00:07:11,314 --> 00:07:12,740
Scott: I'm driving them to the airport Tuesday.

105
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,703
Scott: How about Wednesday?

106
00:07:13,723 --> 00:07:15,590
Scott: how about late on Tuesday?

107
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:16,814
Scott: How about you know?

108
00:07:17,014 --> 00:07:18,640
Scott: and she's like no it's got to be this one.

109
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,086
Rym: She was intractable.

110
00:07:20,287 --> 00:07:22,638
Scott: It's like it would not move and I was like come on.

111
00:07:22,738 --> 00:07:26,630
Rym: so Emily And I just relieved Scott of his chauffeur duty, and we're gonna.

112
00:07:27,272 --> 00:07:30,020
Rym: I debated taking the helicopter, but we're in no rush.

113
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:34,358
Rym: So we're just gonna take the train down and then take the path over to like the those helicopter to Newark.

114
00:07:34,499 --> 00:07:38,173
Scott: yes Oh, I thought the helicopter was only to JFK.

115
00:07:38,213 --> 00:07:38,574
Rym: There's a hell.

116
00:07:38,595 --> 00:07:39,980
Rym: There's helicopters to all three.

117
00:07:40,462 --> 00:07:41,870
Scott: I would have taken the helicopter to Newark.

118
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,860
Rym: the one to Newark is a hundred and seventy bucks a purse.

119
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:44,417
Scott: That's worth it.

120
00:07:44,701 --> 00:07:45,886
Rym: It is it's it's I think.

121
00:07:45,906 --> 00:07:46,910
Scott: think about how much.

122
00:07:47,372 --> 00:07:49,279
Scott: think about how much trouble is gonna be right.

123
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:56,529
Scott: I think how long it would it take for me to drive you right and how you know the gas would have been like you Know 20 bucks something like that.

124
00:07:56,569 --> 00:07:59,040
Rym: You know no if only if only I was looking.

125
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:04,760
Rym: It's not that expensive to fly from Stewart Airport next to our house to Newark.

126
00:08:04,961 --> 00:08:07,047
Scott: Flight at your convenient time.

127
00:08:07,308 --> 00:08:08,010
Rym: well there are little.

128
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,116
Scott: your flight out of Newark at like 11 a.m..

129
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:11,540
Rym: Yeah, it's like 1145.

130
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,352
Scott: Yeah, so you got a. you had to take off from like steward.

131
00:08:14,413 --> 00:08:23,720
Rym: it like you know like When I flew to Raleigh for that convention a while ago I Basically I was gonna fly out of LaGuardia.

132
00:08:23,821 --> 00:08:32,124
Rym: I think I flew out of LaGuardia But it was easier and faster and not any more expensive to take a flight from Stewart Airport.

133
00:08:32,284 --> 00:08:35,679
Rym: that connected with that flight at LaGuardia mmm, so I did that.

134
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,633
Scott: It's actually you know what my mom figured out.

135
00:08:37,674 --> 00:08:38,419
Scott: that was really smart.

136
00:08:39,001 --> 00:08:43,174
Scott: Is that usually every time I go into Florida I go to JFK to get on a jet blue.

137
00:08:43,235 --> 00:08:44,820
Rym: right because you're obsessed with the?

138
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,230
Scott: Jet blue, but why would I?

139
00:08:46,512 --> 00:08:47,560
Scott: why would it go on any other shitty?

140
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,443
Rym: I kind of see why.

141
00:08:48,503 --> 00:08:58,114
Rym: because every time lately I've flown with a jet blue a couple of times but I've flown with other airlines a lot because I go places where jet blue doesn't go and Every night every time I've flown non jet blue.

142
00:08:58,155 --> 00:08:59,100
Rym: It has been a disaster.

143
00:08:59,502 --> 00:09:03,703
Scott: Yeah, pretty much every single time jet blue has all new planes They all just work.

144
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,526
Scott: it all just goes.

145
00:09:04,707 --> 00:09:08,742
Rym: of course when we were flying to PAX remember we get there we get in line We're like yeah.

146
00:09:08,903 --> 00:09:09,725
Rym: Yeah, let's go.

147
00:09:09,765 --> 00:09:12,915
Rym: and then all the computers that the jet blue terminal stopped working.

148
00:09:12,955 --> 00:09:13,196
Scott: Well.

149
00:09:13,256 --> 00:09:14,420
Scott: It's the computer situation.

150
00:09:14,501 --> 00:09:17,790
Scott: That's not a it's not an airplane situation But I like how it.

151
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:25,780
Rym: basically it affected everyone But us because everyone else had a flight in like an hour and but apparently three hours, but apparently jet blue flies.

152
00:09:25,961 --> 00:09:30,640
Scott: You know usually like jet blue doesn't have a lot of like direct flights.

153
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,330
Scott: You'll have to go to like JFK.

154
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:36,929
Scott: like if you want to go from Rochester to Florida You have to go to JFK first and then Florida.

155
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:37,772
Scott: right you can't?

156
00:09:37,992 --> 00:09:40,380
Scott: you know there's not a lot of direct action going on.

157
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,205
Rym: It's like aerobiz.

158
00:09:41,467 --> 00:09:43,017
Rym: JFK is like their hub, right?

159
00:09:43,681 --> 00:09:56,357
Scott: But apparently there's so many big Jews in white planes going to Florida that you can fly from white planes to Florida direct And then that's that's great because the white plans Airport is a lot less crowded.

160
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:57,000
Scott: it is.

161
00:09:58,402 --> 00:10:01,079
Rym: It depends on when you go because you've driven in white planes.

162
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,731
Rym: That's other than that area around Terrytown and 287.

163
00:10:04,731 --> 00:10:07,040
Rym: That's like the worst place in the world.

164
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,027
Scott: You just go down 684 you get off.

165
00:10:09,068 --> 00:10:09,730
Scott: It's not big deal.

166
00:10:10,312 --> 00:10:14,480
Rym: See the thing is I was always driving around there rush hour Because you know I worked over there.

167
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:24,240
Rym: So if I if I was working at that one hospital I would have to take 684 up and home in the middle of rush hour and I would sit for an hour on a four-mile stretch of freeway.

168
00:10:24,463 --> 00:10:25,940
Scott: Yeah, it's not the situation.

169
00:10:26,822 --> 00:10:28,513
Scott: But yeah, there's a the white planes Airport.

170
00:10:28,533 --> 00:10:32,794
Scott: you can go direct to Florida which is very nice much better than you know.

171
00:10:32,814 --> 00:10:34,200
Scott: I mean you know I like JFK.

172
00:10:34,441 --> 00:10:35,307
Scott: I know my way around.

173
00:10:35,327 --> 00:10:36,254
Scott: they got a new terminal.

174
00:10:36,294 --> 00:10:37,120
Scott: everything's happy there.

175
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:41,693
Scott: But you know if you go to a small It's always better to go to smaller airports because you can.

176
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:46,754
Scott: there's shorter lines And you can breeze through more easily if you can avoid the big airport.

177
00:10:46,794 --> 00:10:48,300
Scott: It's better for your time management.

178
00:10:48,461 --> 00:10:50,919
Rym: Yeah, plus small Airport the Wi-Fi always works.

179
00:10:52,101 --> 00:10:52,744
Rym: JK the wife.

180
00:10:52,764 --> 00:10:54,028
Rym: well we were in that like annex.

181
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:56,317
Rym: Yeah, so there were like 400 feet now.

182
00:10:56,337 --> 00:10:57,100
Scott: They have a new terminal.

183
00:10:57,201 --> 00:10:58,833
Scott: I'm pretty sure the Wi-Fi is better over there.

184
00:10:58,953 --> 00:10:59,437
Rym: I hope so.

185
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,628
Rym: yeah Alright, but this week.

186
00:11:01,668 --> 00:11:02,252
Rym: We're like alright.

187
00:11:02,272 --> 00:11:03,420
Rym: This is gonna be an easy short week.

188
00:11:03,761 --> 00:11:05,971
Rym: We decide to go to this can this convention.

189
00:11:06,011 --> 00:11:10,818
Rym: We're gonna put up all these pre-recorded shows And then like everything hits the fan all at once.

190
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:15,281
Rym: now I'm going out of the country and Scott's going to Florida, and we went to this thing over the weekend, so here We are.

191
00:11:15,824 --> 00:11:16,908
Scott: yep, so we're gonna record.

192
00:11:16,928 --> 00:11:18,354
Scott: This is actually not night.

193
00:11:18,695 --> 00:11:22,791
Scott: I'm sorry plus It's like what time is how come 10 11 in the morning?

194
00:11:22,911 --> 00:11:28,150
Rym: right at this moment right as all these things are happening We think we'll just knock off a quick show or not even do a show.

195
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:33,827
Rym: and then there's like the most gigantic Technology news in a long time.

196
00:11:33,847 --> 00:11:36,595
Scott: yeah, so let's see gigantic technology news.

197
00:11:36,636 --> 00:11:37,298
Scott: number one.

198
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:41,023
Scott: right Adobe is Going to play.

199
00:11:41,043 --> 00:11:41,646
Scott: what was that?

200
00:11:42,047 --> 00:11:42,769
Scott: It's Adobe.

201
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:43,612
Scott: That's the company.

202
00:11:43,773 --> 00:11:45,077
Rym: what is that?

203
00:11:45,218 --> 00:11:45,800
Rym: an inside joke?

204
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:46,624
Rym: I don't know about it.

205
00:11:46,685 --> 00:11:47,530
Scott: It's from high school.

206
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:49,846
Scott: this kid used to always say whatever He said.

207
00:11:49,886 --> 00:11:51,099
Scott: Adobe used to be like Adobe.

208
00:11:51,601 --> 00:11:54,029
Scott: That's kind of a because he transferred it cuz.

209
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:59,345
Scott: he used to say cuz apparently when he was like you know in Elementary middle school.

210
00:11:59,405 --> 00:12:06,675
Scott: right it's like you learn about like pueblo Indians who make houses out of Adobe And then they transferred that joke over to the company.

211
00:12:06,997 --> 00:12:10,371
Rym: uh-huh Anyway, kind of like you're all Wikipedia.

212
00:12:10,532 --> 00:12:12,059
Scott: Yeah, Wikipedia same kind of thing.

213
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:26,673
Scott: So Adobe decided that they're going to put flash Directly into televisions, which means you know Netflix Hulu YouTube whatever just in your TV.

214
00:12:27,315 --> 00:12:32,078
Scott: now this I Might wait to buy a TV until like.

215
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:42,113
Rym: well it's strange because one according to I was reading through the comments in the slashdot article a lot of people pointed out that So far only the crappy television manufacturers are on board with this.

216
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:43,838
Scott: yeah cuz that way it's like.

217
00:12:43,878 --> 00:12:47,140
Scott: hey our TV Doesn't have a as awesome a display as yours.

218
00:12:47,502 --> 00:12:49,920
Scott: It's not as the doesn't have the greatest contrast ratio.

219
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:50,785
Scott: But hey you know what.

220
00:12:51,106 --> 00:12:52,353
Scott: people don't give a shit about that.

221
00:12:52,414 --> 00:12:54,042
Scott: people give a shit about features But even like.

222
00:12:54,062 --> 00:12:57,915
Scott: that's why they can sell so many like shitty TVs of the VCR built in cuz.

223
00:12:57,935 --> 00:13:05,497
Rym: you got more features than a TV without but like as of our press time I guess I think Samsung is not on board and that sort of thing.

224
00:13:05,558 --> 00:13:16,597
Rym: but I Feel like this is just this is the final piece to this giant like swirling conundrum of What's going to happen to television because in the last six months?

225
00:13:16,678 --> 00:13:19,512
Rym: I feel like Everything is pointing at television.

226
00:13:19,552 --> 00:13:20,800
Rym: Just like suddenly imploding.

227
00:13:21,524 --> 00:13:24,000
Scott: Yeah, but I think what's actually happening here, right?

228
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:31,040
Scott: Is that people they've always want they've always wanted to apply and size the computer right so they couldn't do that.

229
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:37,557
Scott: So they tried to get web TV and stuff like that You know to make you know to sort of apply and size the internet and it didn't.

230
00:13:37,637 --> 00:13:38,120
Scott: it didn't work.

231
00:13:38,823 --> 00:14:04,266
Scott: So now but what they can do and I think what they figured out now is if you take multimedia things entertainment video right audio and Apply in size not the whole internet, but the specific functions specific sites specific things Right and put it directly into the television where people are comfortable with multimedia and video That that's gonna work really well.

232
00:14:04,768 --> 00:14:09,920
Scott: the problem is of course, you know, it's it's very non open which is well.

233
00:14:10,341 --> 00:14:19,836
Rym: I think we need to look at all the players involved here because I'm not really sure in the end Who this is going to benefit and what the ramifications really will.

234
00:14:19,856 --> 00:14:20,660
Scott: it benefits the TV?

235
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,866
Scott: Manufacture because they sell more TVs.

236
00:14:22,906 --> 00:14:26,839
Scott: it benefits the person because now they can watch you on their TV without plugging a computer.

237
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:32,720
Rym: I mean on one hand We've got the actual providers like the Comcast who they're the ones who have the wire.

238
00:14:32,901 --> 00:14:33,703
Scott: They're unhappy.

239
00:14:33,884 --> 00:14:34,787
Rym: that goes to my house.

240
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:35,830
Scott: They're the losers.

241
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:57,208
Rym: But the thing is their steak is that they basically have two businesses that use the same infrastructure that until recently did not compete with one another and only nerds Understood that they always competed with each other that they gave, you know broadcast television cable TV and they gave internet And originally two separate things and internet.

242
00:14:57,228 --> 00:14:58,472
Scott: the same thing with VoIP right.

243
00:14:58,512 --> 00:15:08,488
Scott: is that you know, we had we had specific, you know data to location services right and Different data needed different physical infrastructure.

244
00:15:08,528 --> 00:15:17,500
Scott: because you know a phone audio to the house needed a special thing video to the house Needed a different special thing and we had all these hacks like our technology data over the phone line.

245
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,383
Rym: So we use modem.

246
00:15:18,403 --> 00:15:23,540
Scott: Yeah, our technology was so weak that we needed specialized hardware for specialized functionality.

247
00:15:24,001 --> 00:15:43,474
Scott: now the same exact hardware can provide all data any data functionality same thing and they have to give up on the you know, specialized hardware over specialized tasks and realize Everyone's just gonna have one unified pipe to their house So that as all anything that can be digitized will go through that.

248
00:15:43,574 --> 00:15:44,820
Rym: and then look at these distributors.

249
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:49,418
Rym: now they they have cable TV, which is massively profitable and doesn't take much for them to do.

250
00:15:49,438 --> 00:15:51,567
Rym: and They have the internet thing.

251
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:58,992
Rym: and suddenly now all the hip people realize that One of those encompasses everything that the other one can provide.

252
00:15:59,614 --> 00:16:01,300
Scott: and also they also do phone.

253
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,726
Scott: It's internet TV and phone.

254
00:16:02,746 --> 00:16:02,926
Scott: to be.

255
00:16:03,007 --> 00:16:05,035
Scott: internet does TV and phone.

256
00:16:05,055 --> 00:16:06,400
Scott: so why pay you know?

257
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:12,419
Scott: It's like I could pay $90 and I would get internet TV and phone and you know And that's 30 bucks each if you divide it out.

258
00:16:12,821 --> 00:16:15,027
Scott: But I instead I pay $50 for internet.

259
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:16,952
Scott: and internet provides TV.

260
00:16:16,992 --> 00:16:19,078
Rym: and but here's the problem why it's also interconnected.

261
00:16:19,138 --> 00:16:27,304
Rym: these providers they make all their money from like cable TV primarily and suddenly as more and more people are using the data side and Realizing wait a minute.

262
00:16:27,766 --> 00:16:29,192
Rym: I get everything I need from the internet.

263
00:16:29,654 --> 00:16:30,819
Rym: Why do I even pay for cable TV?

264
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,100
Scott: Yeah, they don't their advertisements, but the advertisements are directly on the content.

265
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:39,720
Scott: So the publishers get that money whereas when you have cable TV, right?

266
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,146
Scott: There's those cable TV ads.

267
00:16:41,447 --> 00:16:46,086
Scott: so the cable company is getting some money in there and this you know Cuts the cable company out.

268
00:16:46,126 --> 00:16:49,480
Scott: pretty much everything the internet does is cut out middlemen.

269
00:16:49,881 --> 00:16:54,195
Scott: Anyone who's a middleman gets cut out because everyone can now directly connect to everyone else.

270
00:16:54,536 --> 00:16:56,784
Scott: so you don't need a middleman You don't need a distributor.

271
00:16:56,824 --> 00:17:01,340
Scott: You don't need someone in between to get your stuff between a publisher and a consumer.

272
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:07,377
Scott: It's just direct from crater to eater, you know, the farmer directly to your mouth.

273
00:17:07,397 --> 00:17:09,304
Scott: No more supermarket No more, you know.

274
00:17:09,444 --> 00:17:10,468
Scott: now normally it's going on.

275
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:10,829
Rym: normally.

276
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:12,336
Rym: this wouldn't be that big of a deal.

277
00:17:12,356 --> 00:17:19,160
Rym: It would basically be one Industry one segment of an industry that kind of gets obviated by technology and has to adapt and that's fine.

278
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:24,200
Rym: But the real issue here is that they're so interconnected and so incestuous that we look at well.

279
00:17:24,642 --> 00:17:31,434
Rym: I felt like I was turning into a rant like captain steel who we'll talk about later Because I just the word interconnected.

280
00:17:31,454 --> 00:17:34,984
Rym: Yeah I'll talk about that sometime.

281
00:17:35,004 --> 00:17:53,906
Rym: But anyway, so the cable companies they rely on one subscriptions to cable TV Which is really expensive but to they rely on the fact that there's this whole industry that kind of supports their cable in that they're the different networks that either pay to be carried or Pay based on number of subscribers.

282
00:17:54,347 --> 00:17:58,900
Rym: I think cable companies care a lot more about how many people they can say are subscribed.

283
00:17:59,283 --> 00:18:01,300
Rym: Then how many people are paying them to subscribe?

284
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:07,080
Rym: Because in the end remember television is not a product that is sold to you the consumer.

285
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:17,380
Rym: Television is a product that is sold by One entity to another entity for the purpose of getting eyeballs and then putting advertisements at those eyeballs.

286
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:22,060
Scott: Yeah, one guy collects eyeballs, which is you and sells them to someone else, right?

287
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,892
Scott: But now if you just you will sell your own eyeballs.

288
00:18:25,952 --> 00:18:28,480
Scott: you you have one eyeball and you will sell it on its own.

289
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:30,310
Rym: Well, no one will collect them.

290
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,179
Rym: I have to one pair.

291
00:18:32,762 --> 00:18:43,200
Rym: Well for now, I mean, you know with 4chan kids getting more and more I don't know internet II and multitasking Are we gonna get to the part where there are punk kids who have different screens on each eyeball possibly?

292
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:49,584
Rym: but the It's not a joke.

293
00:18:49,986 --> 00:18:51,110
Scott: it is because you're talking about eyes.

294
00:18:51,211 --> 00:18:52,135
Rym: no, that's not a joke.

295
00:18:52,175 --> 00:18:53,279
Rym: that was barely even a pun.

296
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:56,579
Rym: Good job captain.

297
00:18:58,362 --> 00:19:05,040
Rym: So the cable companies are screwed by this because they can't make the money They expected to make off of data and there's all the other concerns about data.

298
00:19:05,702 --> 00:19:13,362
Rym: But the content providers are just as bad off because their whole business model is make a show sell it to advertisers Mm-hmm.

299
00:19:13,984 --> 00:19:19,260
Rym: I think what they should do, but they can't capitalize off of the advertising on the internet the same way.

300
00:19:19,641 --> 00:19:21,248
Rym: I mean look at Hulu.

301
00:19:21,288 --> 00:19:27,960
Rym: they have like they show the one ad and the one ad and I think they Realized that all the internet has shown them is that people don't watch their ads anyway.

302
00:19:28,563 --> 00:19:39,768
Scott: I think what the cable company needs to do right is just Give up and realize that you are just a dumb pipe, you know, you're just gonna be a. you know a data Just data for anything.

303
00:19:39,788 --> 00:19:40,632
Scott: That's all you are.

304
00:19:40,873 --> 00:19:42,440
Scott: You're not gonna be able to do anything else.

305
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:49,720
Scott: So give up and go for it and then just charge what it actually costs plus a reasonable margin.

306
00:19:49,841 --> 00:19:53,380
Rym: And I think that's not going to happen without government regulation.

307
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:53,902
Rym: I don't think.

308
00:19:54,363 --> 00:19:59,740
Scott: well because the problem is is that makes enough money, you know, you're charging cost plus a reasonable margin.

309
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,191
Scott: You're gonna make a reasonable margin.

310
00:20:01,211 --> 00:20:02,319
Scott: people will pay for it, right?

311
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:07,354
Scott: Yeah, the problem is it's less money than they're making now, but it's profitable.

312
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,240
Scott: it'll be able to live forever with that.

313
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:09,664
Scott: You know what?

314
00:20:09,745 --> 00:20:11,219
Scott: It's less than they're making now.

315
00:20:11,521 --> 00:20:11,942
Rym: We need to.

316
00:20:11,982 --> 00:20:19,340
Scott: we really need and I you know, I bet especially if all the cable companies do it There'll be price wars on it and the margins will get shoved down.

317
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:22,133
Scott: But I bend because that'll be the only differentiating factor.

318
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:38,388
Rym: I bend very often toward you know deregulate regulation in certain sectors and I Generally want to avoid, you know, giant beer bureaucratic clusterfucks of government controlling industries, but at the same time We regulate utilities the government just.

319
00:20:38,568 --> 00:20:39,110
Rym: I mean you're not.

320
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:45,600
Rym: you don't have water companies that are in this sort of growth market Trying to capitalize on the fact that they're pumping water into my pot.

321
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,849
Scott: Yeah, the thing is the water company was never private.

322
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:52,940
Scott: what happens when somebody has a private company, right?

323
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,815
Scott: Let's say, you know, you know and then it becomes a commodity.

324
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:00,135
Rym: You just you take it if it's something that's necessary.

325
00:21:00,155 --> 00:21:07,977
Rym: and I feel that the Internet There's no as necessary as any other utility now, it is electricity and water now, it's data.

326
00:21:08,037 --> 00:21:09,000
Rym: We have these three things.

327
00:21:10,382 --> 00:21:14,080
Rym: We need some sort of eminent domain that isn't just for physical property.

328
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:21,460
Rym: I mean we're talking about this the other day Scott and I because the MLK Foundation is going su crazy again Because people are using Martin Luther King speeches.

329
00:21:22,641 --> 00:21:26,874
Rym: We need eminent domain for intellectual property and we need an eminent domain equivalent.

330
00:21:26,894 --> 00:21:30,575
Rym: the government just needs to take regulate Data and make it a.

331
00:21:30,897 --> 00:21:37,060
Scott: yeah Right now we talk about you know, like the government buying banks, right?

332
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,170
Scott: Why does the government have to buy the bank?

333
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:41,160
Scott: if the government is eminent domain the bank?

334
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:47,659
Scott: We wouldn't have to pay, you know, how much money would that is saved if the government could just say, okay So this bank is worth a million dollars.

335
00:21:48,404 --> 00:21:50,175
Scott: Why do it's got all this banks got?

336
00:21:50,195 --> 00:21:50,980
Scott: just take the bank.

337
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,548
Rym: Um, because the bank is not owned by the bank.

338
00:21:53,588 --> 00:21:55,033
Rym: The bank is owned by all the shareholders.

339
00:21:55,073 --> 00:21:58,341
Scott: Yeah, eminent domain they lose that.

340
00:21:58,422 --> 00:22:08,132
Rym: the problem with that is that if you do it that way you basically undermine all of the kind of Expected integrity of the stock market and you would cause an economic disaster.

341
00:22:08,233 --> 00:22:10,299
Scott: Well, it's no different than you eminent domain someone's house.

342
00:22:11,301 --> 00:22:11,783
Rym: No, it's not.

343
00:22:11,823 --> 00:22:14,152
Rym: That's the equivalent of eminent domain in everyone's houses.

344
00:22:14,453 --> 00:22:18,879
Rym: Yeah, that's not good You know, no, it's got.

345
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,174
Rym: Practicality always overrides ideology in the end.

346
00:22:22,435 --> 00:22:24,226
Scott: I'm just saying you know We need some more.

347
00:22:24,307 --> 00:22:28,387
Scott: we need eminent domain to be used in a good way Yes, but not in the way that you just suggested.

348
00:22:28,427 --> 00:22:29,069
Rym: That's crazy.

349
00:22:29,169 --> 00:22:29,530
Scott: Why not?

350
00:22:30,654 --> 00:22:41,928
Rym: I just think we need the government to regulate Data infrastructure as a utility as opposed to now where it's this kind of Wild West private enterprise craziness,

351
00:22:41,949 --> 00:22:54,320
Scott: mmm Maybe someone should just start a company that is Internet utility and then see how you can compete with the cable guys because your price your price is gonna be way lower Than the 50 bucks a month that we have to pay for out to one line.

352
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:57,008
Rym: That's basically impossible because of all the last mile concerns.

353
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,673
Scott: Yeah, but you can get in on that.

354
00:22:59,175 --> 00:23:00,539
Rym: how how are you gonna afford to?

355
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:07,720
Scott: You start in a city and you know, I that's probably there's a lot of people doing like last mile Ethernet and stuff.

356
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,538
Scott: You can get in on that.

357
00:23:09,743 --> 00:23:11,800
Rym: I don't think it's quite as simple as you're making it out to me.

358
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,269
Rym: I don't think it's ever going to happen without government intervention.

359
00:23:14,289 --> 00:23:17,020
Scott: No, you know, it's still someone should try.

360
00:23:18,081 --> 00:23:23,340
Rym: But try what I mean, okay, I make an ISP and what I just try not to make as much money as everyone else.

361
00:23:23,721 --> 00:23:29,620
Scott: No, you provide, you know, you just provide internet services and you don't charge as much as the cable company.

362
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,844
Rym: I just have lower prices.

363
00:23:31,385 --> 00:23:36,060
Rym: Yeah, you're saying yeah, and I if there were a space for that someone would have done it.

364
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,328
Rym: There's clearly no space for it.

365
00:23:37,408 --> 00:23:38,475
Scott: I think this space for it.

366
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:44,380
Scott: I Disagree if we could get internet that was just as good as what we have now and was cost less money.

367
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:55,909
Rym: Yes, and Scott I don't think that can happen because if the prices are out of whack then people would definitely see a business opportunity there and the Fact that no one is really doing this Indicates to me that there isn't enough money available.

368
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:56,993
Rym: It's not profitable.

369
00:23:57,755 --> 00:23:59,340
Scott: I think it's just not as profitable.

370
00:23:59,501 --> 00:24:00,787
Rym: No, I just don't think it's profitable.

371
00:24:00,847 --> 00:24:01,068
Scott: Yeah.

372
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:05,465
Scott: Anyway, so there was another Gigantamous tech news today.

373
00:24:06,066 --> 00:24:11,183
Scott: kind of word was that yeah, I know you hate words that are incorrect So I use it on purpose.

374
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:13,130
Rym: I don't mind cromulant words.

375
00:24:13,933 --> 00:24:18,310
Rym: I live my life in full cromulants But ginormous is just a stupid word.

376
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:19,073
Rym: that sounds stupid.

377
00:24:19,093 --> 00:24:20,840
Scott: Yeah, so I said gigantamous instead.

378
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,734
Rym: Derivative of ginormous is even worse.

379
00:24:23,975 --> 00:24:25,952
Rym: I know It's even worse.

380
00:24:25,992 --> 00:24:29,625
Scott: Maybe I should keep going Ginormous that doesn't?

381
00:24:29,686 --> 00:24:31,413
Scott: that sounds more like anal related.

382
00:24:31,533 --> 00:24:33,079
Scott: then what anyway?

383
00:24:35,143 --> 00:24:37,412
Scott: So there were rumors are going around.

384
00:24:37,432 --> 00:24:39,139
Rym: we didn't even talk about the flash thing.

385
00:24:40,105 --> 00:24:40,528
Rym: Yeah, we did.

386
00:24:40,568 --> 00:24:42,220
Rym: We basically just talked about isp.

387
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,692
Scott: Well, because that's what the flash thing really means in the end.

388
00:24:45,712 --> 00:24:46,314
Scott: There is.

389
00:24:46,334 --> 00:24:48,160
Rym: we won't talk about it now, but I think there's.

390
00:24:49,242 --> 00:24:51,149
Rym: That was the first point I was going to.

391
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:55,679
Scott: I do think the one other thing I could say about the flash thing though Is that I think it might?

392
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:01,040
Scott: Cut off less technologically inclined people from the fullness of the internet.

393
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,445
Scott: You know some you know, they might.

394
00:25:02,525 --> 00:25:14,760
Scott: just if they experience the Internet's only through you know These applications in the television then they're cut off from the whole thing It's like, you know, so like the AOL is ation where you can't see the whole internet.

395
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:18,340
Scott: You can only see this part that has been crafted for you by some company.

396
00:25:18,481 --> 00:25:18,601
Scott: well,

397
00:25:18,621 --> 00:25:37,159
Rym: what I think is that the reason this is a concern that you know, the second point I was gonna get to is that The content providers so far seem to be For whatever reason fully on the side of the cable TV industry and they're trying to keep Broadcast television going and they're trying like remember the boxy debacle Hulu and all that.

398
00:25:37,922 --> 00:25:45,290
Rym: They desperately don't want people to stop watching TV and they desperately want them to continue to use push media as opposed to pull media.

399
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:53,700
Rym: and I feel like What they really need to do is look at this and say why don't we just give up on the cable companies?

400
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,007
Rym: Let them steward their own juices.

401
00:25:55,027 --> 00:25:56,434
Rym: I just go internet full-on.

402
00:25:56,454 --> 00:25:58,538
Scott: Mm-hmm All right.

403
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:10,800
Scott: So there were rumors going around last week that IBM would buy Sun microsystems and that you know It seemed at least slightly reasonable because Sun, you know Sun is sort of important.

404
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,904
Scott: They do a lot of stuff.

405
00:26:11,984 --> 00:26:14,935
Scott: but you know, they run Java and they make.

406
00:26:14,955 --> 00:26:22,819
Scott: they actually still make computers I'm pretty sure Big servers and things and Sun actually has a lot of really awesome open source stuff going on.

407
00:26:23,322 --> 00:26:25,959
Scott: Most notably they got the virtual box, which is pretty great.

408
00:26:26,802 --> 00:26:30,674
Scott: They got they got an open SSO, which is a single sign-on solution.

409
00:26:30,694 --> 00:26:31,477
Scott: That's really great.

410
00:26:31,517 --> 00:26:37,260
Scott: They got an open Directory service which goes along with the single sign-on which is like an open LDAP kind of thing.

411
00:26:37,742 --> 00:26:40,634
Scott: They do lots of awesome open source stuff over down at Sun.

412
00:26:40,654 --> 00:26:43,624
Scott: they open Solaris, you know They got the Solaris operating system.

413
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:44,346
Scott: that's closed.

414
00:26:44,607 --> 00:26:45,790
Scott: They bought MySQL.

415
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:47,735
Rym: right now the this.

416
00:26:48,056 --> 00:27:00,114
Rym: the rumors came and there's a lot of talk and then it all broke down and there are a lot of Speculation and rumors and ideas as to why IBM decided not to jump in on this and then out of nowhere Oracle says you know what we'll buy him.

417
00:27:00,456 --> 00:27:02,384
Scott: Yep today It's Oracle bought Sun.

418
00:27:02,505 --> 00:27:02,886
Scott: they bought him.

419
00:27:03,548 --> 00:27:04,090
Rym: now this.

420
00:27:04,772 --> 00:27:15,853
Rym: we could talk a lot about all the different ramifications of this but I think the primary one for people like us is that Now Oracle and my SQL are owned by the same company.

421
00:27:16,315 --> 00:27:20,028
Scott: Those are like the two biggest Relational databases there are.

422
00:27:20,048 --> 00:27:21,232
Rym: I mean, what else do we have?

423
00:27:21,252 --> 00:27:22,838
Rym: There's DB to IBM's.

424
00:27:22,858 --> 00:27:23,500
Scott: that doesn't count.

425
00:27:23,761 --> 00:27:24,523
Scott: That's nothing.

426
00:27:24,965 --> 00:27:25,226
Rym: Actually.

427
00:27:25,246 --> 00:27:25,587
Rym: That's not.

428
00:27:25,607 --> 00:27:28,698
Rym: that's widely deployed and widely used and big iron.

429
00:27:28,738 --> 00:27:29,280
Scott: That's scary.

430
00:27:29,641 --> 00:27:34,240
Rym: I actually we you didn't go in the open New York City thing that we had to talk about enterprise stuff.

431
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,384
Rym: Yeah, almost everyone.

432
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:37,832
Rym: there was a DB to admin really.

433
00:27:37,852 --> 00:27:39,919
Rym: Yeah, I used to be a DB to admin.

434
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:44,048
Scott: Wow And wasn't there also stuff like cybase and shit, right?

435
00:27:44,149 --> 00:27:47,198
Rym: Well, the other the other big one is Postgres.

436
00:27:47,438 --> 00:27:50,725
Rym: Yep, and The problem is my SQL.

437
00:27:50,825 --> 00:27:55,940
Rym: I've been dubious of my SQL almost forever because it worked pretty well and it scaled pretty well.

438
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:56,789
Rym: It performed pretty well.

439
00:27:56,809 --> 00:27:57,779
Rym: There are a lot of tools for it.

440
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,420
Rym: It was easy, but at the same time it was kind of this weird.

441
00:28:01,882 --> 00:28:07,380
Rym: I never trusted it because at any time like all the good features were always kind of pulled into the enterprise version.

442
00:28:08,542 --> 00:28:09,286
Scott: Son bought them.

443
00:28:09,627 --> 00:28:11,496
Rym: Yeah as opposed to the community version.

444
00:28:11,516 --> 00:28:16,074
Scott: that's free Yeah, but my SQL is just it's sort of you know, it's that fit is just.

445
00:28:16,135 --> 00:28:19,580
Scott: it goes so well with PHP Which is I think why they're so often put together.

446
00:28:20,103 --> 00:28:22,540
Scott: It's sort of that technology that works.

447
00:28:22,961 --> 00:28:27,800
Scott: But the architecture is sort of fundamentally flawed and it has a lot of these problems.

448
00:28:28,241 --> 00:28:30,990
Scott: But you can make it work you'll get by.

449
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:34,240
Scott: it won't be pretty and a lot of companies just work on that.

450
00:28:34,361 --> 00:28:40,209
Scott: you know, they they got everything duct-taped together and It's got enough juice to keep the keep it going.

451
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:41,714
Scott: and that's how they go.

452
00:28:41,734 --> 00:28:48,940
Scott: All right, and that's My SQL is and Oracle is you know, sort of the real deal.

453
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:54,420
Scott: It's got every feature in the known universe any time I've ever had like a database problem and I want to do something easily.

454
00:28:55,062 --> 00:28:58,780
Scott: Oracle always just has the feature and it's so, you know, perfect and wonderful.

455
00:28:59,182 --> 00:29:01,920
Scott: The thing is it costs a fortune to get Oracle.

456
00:29:02,101 --> 00:29:05,620
Scott: It's like a bajillion dollars and you need like a bajillion dollars in hardware to run it.

457
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,626
Scott: You can't just run it on your laptop.

458
00:29:07,666 --> 00:29:09,271
Scott: Like you can run MySQL on your laptop.

459
00:29:09,512 --> 00:29:11,398
Rym: Oh, don't forget to MS SQL.

460
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:13,867
Rym: All right Yeah, that's a widely deployed.

461
00:29:13,947 --> 00:29:14,208
Scott: It is.

462
00:29:14,228 --> 00:29:16,980
Rym: Yeah, I forgot about that one very easy to use performs pretty well.

463
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,051
Scott: Yeah, it's Microsoft SQL is okay, but it has.

464
00:29:20,352 --> 00:29:22,700
Scott: you know, it it's a typical Microsoft product.

465
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:25,575
Scott: Yeah, which is you know, so that's the only thing wrong with that.

466
00:29:25,776 --> 00:29:26,580
Rym: all that that entails.

467
00:29:26,661 --> 00:29:30,371
Rym: Yes, but I feel like suddenly They like.

468
00:29:30,412 --> 00:29:40,960
Rym: for a long time I've kind of realized that a lot of smarter people have realized that We're more and more at least web 2.0 style people Relying on my SQL because everything kind of uses that by default.

469
00:29:41,341 --> 00:29:51,257
Rym: But at the same time my SQL seemed like it was getting less and less open and less and less Reliable and more and more limiting like as you expand what you're doing, right?

470
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,491
Scott: It's like my SQL becomes more and more problematic for you.

471
00:29:55,531 --> 00:29:58,219
Scott: Like for example, you can use the my isaam.

472
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,752
Scott: You know, what's it called for?

473
00:30:00,792 --> 00:30:01,817
Scott: your tables, right?

474
00:30:01,857 --> 00:30:02,440
Rym: That's what I use.

475
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:09,040
Scott: But if you use my isaam, you don't get like all these nice, you know quality sort of more enterprises features of the InnoDB.

476
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:14,660
Scott: But the InnoDB right doesn't have like the full text searching of the my isaam.

477
00:30:15,201 --> 00:30:17,126
Scott: So it's like it doesn't have both.

478
00:30:17,187 --> 00:30:24,106
Rym: you can't do both at once and there I mean the technical details of the problems I've always had with my SQL are numerous.

479
00:30:24,327 --> 00:30:28,060
Rym: I don't want to get into them, but if you take nothing away from this.

480
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:33,731
Rym: But what I'm about to say now Postgres is suddenly the future and it's always been the future.

481
00:30:33,751 --> 00:30:36,760
Rym: Postgres is like the open source big iron date.

482
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,628
Scott: It's hard a thing is it's harder to use.

483
00:30:38,648 --> 00:30:40,396
Scott: You gotta it's more learning is required.

484
00:30:40,436 --> 00:30:53,279
Rym: I haven't even learned it yet Yeah but in the last few years actually in the last like year there have been giant leaps and bounds in Postgres support by various things like there's a PHP my admin equivalent for Postgres and all these sorts of things.

485
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:55,420
Rym: but You know we use Postgres at work.

486
00:30:55,601 --> 00:31:00,061
Rym: I really didn't know anything about Postgres until I got to the company I work at now and we use it for a lot of stuff.

487
00:31:00,141 --> 00:31:10,740
Scott: I knew that it was the other open source database and I knew that it was more difficult than my SQL and I Knew that you know a lot of things out there like say WordPress and stuff sort of sort of need.

488
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:17,245
Scott: I mean, I'm sure there's a way to make WordPress work on Postgres, but these things were designed to work on my SQL Which is just what everyone used.

489
00:31:17,285 --> 00:31:17,848
Scott: It's so easy.

490
00:31:17,868 --> 00:31:22,284
Scott: You just you know, you push a few buttons and there you go Database and everything goes.

491
00:31:22,605 --> 00:31:29,868
Scott: so I've always used my SQL because I'm using things that just work so easily on it and Trying to use Postgres instead would have been very difficult.

492
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:31,935
Rym: But even though it performs better.

493
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:32,838
Rym: It's more reliable.

494
00:31:32,898 --> 00:31:33,460
Rym: It's more robust.

495
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:41,420
Rym: It's pretty much better in every way except for the learning curve of getting into it and using it and the support natively by applications.

496
00:31:42,202 --> 00:31:42,965
Rym: It was always better.

497
00:31:43,205 --> 00:31:44,590
Rym: It's still better and it's yet it.

498
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:51,851
Scott: in terms of you know under the hood enterprise features Replication reliability security, but performance.

499
00:31:52,112 --> 00:31:55,100
Rym: one really used it except for really hardcore people.

500
00:31:55,221 --> 00:32:06,681
Rym: And I feel like as of today with this Oracle buying Sun I think a lot of the kind of hardcore open source developers are going to look at this and say we can't trust my SQL For shit.

501
00:32:06,741 --> 00:32:12,980
Scott: Yeah, it's like we sort of went in when Sun bought my SQL, but Sun was a good open source citizen.

502
00:32:13,182 --> 00:32:14,880
Rym: Yeah, they like Sun played a lot.

503
00:32:15,081 --> 00:32:19,576
Scott: I just talked about all the great open source stuff that Sun does more so than anyone expected.

504
00:32:19,637 --> 00:32:20,560
Rym: Sun played nice.

505
00:32:21,363 --> 00:32:22,568
Rym: They came into the sandbox.

506
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:25,200
Rym: They took over one of the sandcastles and they didn't step on it.

507
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,046
Scott: Yeah, they made Java open source, right?

508
00:32:27,106 --> 00:32:31,060
Scott: I mean, come on, you know, they kept Java closed for how long before open sourcing it.

509
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:31,842
Scott: They were all good.

510
00:32:32,464 --> 00:32:36,254
Scott: But now I wonder you know, how how nice is it?

511
00:32:36,334 --> 00:32:38,480
Scott: The open source Sun stuff gonna be now?

512
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:42,567
Scott: I mean, I think it does stuff that's already been open sourced Is they can't?

513
00:32:42,728 --> 00:32:45,060
Scott: Oracle can't lock it up because people just fork it out.

514
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:52,955
Scott: You know if they lock up Java and the next Java vert release is closed source We'll just fork the previous Java release into the open source Java and that'll be that.

515
00:32:53,376 --> 00:32:57,113
Scott: but you know I wonder what Oracle is gonna do and it could.

516
00:32:57,233 --> 00:32:58,560
Rym: if you know, I don't think it matters.

517
00:32:58,841 --> 00:33:07,640
Rym: I I think that regardless of what happens from this day forward I think there's going to a be a massive shift toward postgres in open source development.

518
00:33:07,781 --> 00:33:10,860
Scott: But I think in the enterprise realm there's going to be.

519
00:33:11,861 --> 00:33:17,656
Scott: There's a lot of people out there who use like the J2EE, you know stack, right?

520
00:33:17,756 --> 00:33:23,420
Scott: And I think that the Java Solaris Oracle stack is going to get a big boost in the enterprise world.

521
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:34,173
Rym: I feel I think enterprise web stuff and enterprise, you know database driven web stuff is really going to suddenly dichotomize into either IBM web sphere or some sort of thing.

522
00:33:34,213 --> 00:33:35,400
Scott: is it'll go to IBM web sphere.

523
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:41,471
Rym: It already is not too many Yeah a lot more than you think yeah, but I feel like it.

524
00:33:41,773 --> 00:33:43,740
Rym: IBM web sphere is gonna be the big player.

525
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:46,875
Scott: No, but the big players gonna be Oracle and Microsoft.

526
00:33:46,976 --> 00:33:47,820
Rym: You didn't even let me finish.

527
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:53,518
Rym: I don't think you understand how widely deployed web sphere is and how many like big iron enterprise people use it.

528
00:33:53,638 --> 00:33:53,999
Rym: I hate it.

529
00:33:54,361 --> 00:33:59,080
Rym: I administered it for years and it was a disaster, but it's like again at that conference.

530
00:33:59,761 --> 00:34:01,188
Rym: Everyone knew it everyone used it.

531
00:34:01,228 --> 00:34:02,835
Rym: Everyone supported all the big firms like.

532
00:34:02,856 --> 00:34:03,780
Rym: that was their backbone.

533
00:34:04,222 --> 00:34:09,984
Scott: I'm looking at all the I haven't seen webs here appear in like a single job listing and I've been looking at job listings for Weeks now, you know why?

534
00:34:10,284 --> 00:34:14,219
Rym: because there are an infinite number of web sphere developers and admins available.

535
00:34:14,541 --> 00:34:25,203
Rym: Yeah, so many people know it that if in fact half the people, you know We're looking to hire at our company almost everyone who applied was a web sphere Java Tomcat kind of guy Uh-huh.

536
00:34:25,364 --> 00:34:27,980
Rym: So if you need someone like that, there are a hundred people.

537
00:34:28,061 --> 00:34:30,179
Rym: You can snap your fingers and they'll work for you for almost nothing.

538
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:34,235
Scott: I see a lot of people doing Java powered sites, but not on web sphere.

539
00:34:34,275 --> 00:34:34,958
Scott: They're doing it on.

540
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,679
Rym: Well web sphere is one of those big iron enterprise things.

541
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:42,981
Rym: I mean a little hundred person company is probably not gonna use it but a lot of big places use it in a lot of Ways.

542
00:34:43,001 --> 00:34:45,311
Rym: they probably shouldn't anyway, but I feel like that.

543
00:34:45,652 --> 00:34:49,606
Scott: but his web sphere relational database Web sphere is like Tomcat.

544
00:34:50,027 --> 00:34:50,228
Scott: Yes.

545
00:34:50,248 --> 00:34:51,774
Scott: That's a Java application server.

546
00:34:51,793 --> 00:34:56,739
Rym: That's not a that's not a Database it isn't but under the hood what databases they use.

547
00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:06,414
Rym: I'm just saying that I feel like the big competition for the web sphere paradigm which often uses db2 on the back end will be Appliances that'll just be sold by Oracle.

548
00:35:06,434 --> 00:35:07,280
Rym: that'll do everything.

549
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:11,959
Rym: It'll be Java and their database and like everything you need all-in-one appliance buy it turn it out.

550
00:35:11,979 --> 00:35:12,280
Rym: It works.

551
00:35:12,581 --> 00:35:14,590
Rym: Yeah, well, I think that's what they're gonna push.

552
00:35:14,932 --> 00:35:16,740
Scott: Well, I guess the Sun does the hardware, right?

553
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:29,274
Rym: So yeah I just I feel like this acquisition gives them all these little pieces that now they can trivially integrate together Into some sort of unified platform that goes way beyond any Existing unified platform.

554
00:35:29,638 --> 00:35:34,495
Rym: Mmm For enterprise II stuff, you know, not the things that we do the things that companies do.

555
00:35:34,535 --> 00:35:40,095
Scott: Yeah, cuz even look Microsoft They'll sell you SQL Server right and with is and such but they don't.

556
00:35:40,315 --> 00:35:41,640
Scott: they won't sell it to you on a machine.

557
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:47,620
Scott: You have to buy a machine with like from Dell and get that stuff pre-installed and then configure it yourself or whatever.

558
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:48,304
Scott: You know.

559
00:35:48,365 --> 00:35:55,559
Scott: now Oracle can sell you a piece of hardware With Oracle running on it with everything already running already configured etc.

560
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,750
Scott: That's sudden that no, I don't think anyone else sells that except IBM.

561
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:02,560
Rym: Maybe yeah, IBM has similar offering.

562
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:05,653
Scott: yeah, they'll sell you a piece of hardware with a web sphere on it and such.

563
00:36:05,733 --> 00:36:10,355
Rym: but yeah, I just Postgres is the only part I care about.

564
00:36:10,658 --> 00:36:22,020
Scott: Yeah And I if you are I'm also worried about some of the other Sun open source II stuff like, you know I don't use like the single sign-on but I use the virtual box and you know the single side and I'd like to use.

565
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,886
Scott: You know, I don't know.

566
00:36:23,987 --> 00:36:26,154
Scott: It'd be nice if that stuff just sort of kept up.

567
00:36:26,676 --> 00:36:37,427
Rym: but like I you know I just used something called likewise and that gives you perfect single sign-on with any Linux Unix or whatever Through just Active Directory.

568
00:36:37,748 --> 00:36:38,049
Scott: Mmm.

569
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:41,320
Scott: So as long as you have an Active Directory, so but that's that's the client side.

570
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:43,330
Scott: Yeah, but Sun gives you the server.

571
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:43,671
Rym: Oh, yeah.

572
00:36:43,691 --> 00:36:45,420
Rym: I know you gotta have the Microsoft Active Directory.

573
00:36:45,942 --> 00:36:48,189
Scott: This replaces the Microsoft Active Directory server.

574
00:36:48,209 --> 00:36:52,102
Scott: so you can run one of these and then have all your Macs Windows and Linux is Sign in.

575
00:36:52,363 --> 00:36:52,523
Rym: Yeah.

576
00:36:52,584 --> 00:36:53,246
Rym: Well, we can do that.

577
00:36:53,327 --> 00:36:54,090
Rym: Anyway, just you got it.

578
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:55,977
Rym: You know client side stuff has to be done.

579
00:36:55,997 --> 00:37:05,336
Rym: Yeah that work Yep, but anyway things of the day.

580
00:37:05,376 --> 00:37:06,678
Rym: So do you have a thing?

581
00:37:06,698 --> 00:37:07,740
Scott: So check this out?

582
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,209
Scott: You got a. there's a website geek stuff for you.

583
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:15,228
Scott: Number four letter you will link will link and I've bought some stuff from there.

584
00:37:15,269 --> 00:37:17,140
Scott: I think I bought a happy hacking keyboard from there.

585
00:37:17,521 --> 00:37:31,459
Scott: They sell sort of that, you know, the Japanese sort of peripherals accessories stuff That's not so easy to get, you know sort of a think geek but not quite it's it's think geek but actual Like computer hardware you can use, you know.

586
00:37:33,181 --> 00:37:37,377
Scott: And on their website, I saw something the acrylic cowboy now acrylic cowboy.

587
00:37:37,397 --> 00:37:38,180
Scott: I think is a company.

588
00:37:38,321 --> 00:37:41,412
Scott: I just that makes a whole bunch of sounds vaguely like a sex toy.

589
00:37:42,014 --> 00:37:43,580
Scott: Yeah, it does but it's not.

590
00:37:44,764 --> 00:37:49,400
Scott: What they do is they make computer cases that are made of acrylic which is kind of cool.

591
00:37:50,062 --> 00:37:53,433
Scott: But the acrylic cowboy like this specific one is way awesome.

592
00:37:53,453 --> 00:37:55,963
Scott: What it is is the flat P. It's just.

593
00:37:56,084 --> 00:37:57,939
Scott: it's a computer case, but it's not a box.

594
00:37:58,201 --> 00:38:06,760
Scott: it's just a flat piece of acrylic with some holes in it and You just screw your computer into and it supports ATX and micro ATX and your computer is open to the air.

595
00:38:06,861 --> 00:38:14,195
Scott: You've got the drives Mounted under the piece of plastic and you've got the motherboard and the power supply on top of the piece of plastic.

596
00:38:14,816 --> 00:38:15,257
Scott: and that's it.

597
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:18,579
Scott: and You know your computer is open to the air.

598
00:38:18,801 --> 00:38:23,000
Scott: So I wouldn't you know, I wouldn't use this in like an environment where something might splash onto it.

599
00:38:23,241 --> 00:38:24,024
Scott: It's not so good.

600
00:38:24,647 --> 00:38:30,087
Scott: But let's say you're testing a whole bunch of computer parts or You know something along those lines.

601
00:38:30,188 --> 00:38:33,460
Scott: or you just got a new computer and you want to sort of make sure all the parts work.

602
00:38:33,961 --> 00:38:39,297
Scott: And without having to put it into a case, this is totally awesome and totally useful and it's only what like 7,500 yen.

603
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:42,640
Rym: I think it's basically free 7,500 yen's.

604
00:38:42,701 --> 00:38:43,382
Scott: I think it's $75.

605
00:38:43,382 --> 00:38:44,024
Scott: That's that's like a hoji.

606
00:38:44,064 --> 00:38:45,308
Rym: Yeah, $75 is still is still it's not free, right?

607
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:56,620
Scott: But yeah, I mean if you're considering I paid $150 for my case, which is still suboptimal and that's the other thing right?

608
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:02,140
Scott: It's like I keep you know Like you keep like a computer case around cuz like what if I get some computer parts?

609
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:02,943
Scott: To test them out.

610
00:39:03,404 --> 00:39:05,130
Scott: with this you can get one of these.

611
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:09,832
Scott: it takes up almost no space and you can just get rid of All your junky computer cases.

612
00:39:09,872 --> 00:39:10,899
Scott: just have one of these guys.

613
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:22,565
Scott: So Scott Johnson, you know, I know that you're most of your computer stuff is like old and sort of the idea is to you know Not buy new stuff, but it's probably worth it to get this acrylic cowboy At least one of them.

614
00:39:22,666 --> 00:39:25,620
Rym: just yeah, you know one computer at a time testing all the components.

615
00:39:25,681 --> 00:39:30,380
Scott: Yeah, just get one of them put like a you know Good drives under it and then put a motherboard.

616
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:30,601
Scott: You

617
00:39:30,621 --> 00:39:49,100
Rym: know what I would do if I worked in like a computer donation place or anywhere where I dealt with a lot of old Computers, I'd have one of those for every basic like motherboard Layout like every you know socket a whatever DDRM whatever and I'd have each one just exist as a tester of RAM and CPUs and peripherals.

618
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:55,760
Scott: These are also really good right if you want to do like teach some computer hardware stuff to people You know teach people how to put computers together.

619
00:39:56,382 --> 00:40:05,900
Scott: It'd be way easier to get like You know acrylic cowboys around the room then to like actually have people with like these cases going on You know with dealing with the mounting brackets and all that other bullshit.

620
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,928
Scott: Yeah, you know, so this is actually.

621
00:40:07,948 --> 00:40:09,494
Scott: this is a pretty awesome thing right here.

622
00:40:09,675 --> 00:40:11,837
Scott: And when I get a job again I might just buy one.

623
00:40:12,702 --> 00:40:15,220
Rym: So, uh real quick you can just watch these videos.

624
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:20,468
Rym: But you know, we talked a lot on Tuesday or at least we used to about the angry video game nerd And he's a really cool guy.

625
00:40:20,488 --> 00:40:23,000
Rym: He's really into film his whole life and he's really talented.

626
00:40:23,281 --> 00:40:27,180
Rym: He started doing these videos a long time ago about bad old video games.

627
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:30,839
Rym: So the Tuesday GeekNights people all know about him, but Monday people might not.

628
00:40:30,859 --> 00:40:36,185
Rym: I know There's people who are only into one or two things and they don't listen to all of the the fullness of what we have to offer.

629
00:40:36,876 --> 00:40:44,180
Rym: but He independent of being the angry video game nerd is like one of the biggest film buff guys I've ever seen.

630
00:40:44,601 --> 00:40:45,304
Scott: Well, he's not.

631
00:40:45,685 --> 00:40:47,673
Scott: he's pretty vague, but he's not the biggest I seen.

632
00:40:47,834 --> 00:40:49,380
Rym: well, he's one of the biggest I've seen.

633
00:40:49,681 --> 00:40:52,292
Scott: You know what he has is actually he's the biggest I've seen.

634
00:40:52,613 --> 00:41:00,885
Rym: that's not stupid and pretentious Uh-huh, but he did this great series of two videos Reviewing Star Wars.

635
00:41:00,966 --> 00:41:03,012
Rym: now that might seem pointless.

636
00:41:03,173 --> 00:41:05,540
Rym: I mean, we've all seen Star Wars a million times.

637
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,382
Rym: They're for.

638
00:41:06,423 --> 00:41:25,039
Rym: Star Wars has possibly been reviewed and discussed more than any movie ever, especially among geeks, but It amazed me that he was able to make these videos where all he does is review Star Wars from his own personal perspective And not only enlighten me but informed me there were some things I did not realize that he pointed out.

639
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:25,541
Rym: Mm-hmm.

640
00:41:25,561 --> 00:41:27,508
Scott: I mean there are some things I did realize.

641
00:41:27,528 --> 00:41:30,037
Scott: it's some things I forgot and then were reminded of.

642
00:41:30,177 --> 00:41:32,699
Scott: but yeah He's there's some a lot of good stuff going on.

643
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,041
Scott: He.

644
00:41:33,381 --> 00:41:40,720
Rym: all he did was remind me one how much I love those movies and to how bad the Phantom Menace really was.

645
00:41:41,961 --> 00:41:43,990
Rym: Because he always think maybe it wasn't that bad.

646
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:45,617
Rym: I didn't see it through the eyes of a kid.

647
00:41:45,657 --> 00:41:46,420
Rym: I saw it later.

648
00:41:47,562 --> 00:41:48,485
Rym: No that movie sucks.

649
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:51,114
Rym: that movie is awful, it's pretty bad.

650
00:41:51,496 --> 00:41:52,620
Scott: Phantom Edit not so bad.

651
00:41:54,166 --> 00:41:58,600
Scott: Yeah Phantom Ed, it's been just sort of coming to my mind a lot lately.

652
00:41:58,841 --> 00:42:04,780
Rym: Well because it illustrates everything that's wrong with intellectual property laws today and everything that was wrong with episode one.

653
00:42:05,123 --> 00:42:06,660
Rym: Yeah, the Phantom Menace, okay.

654
00:42:07,502 --> 00:42:18,173
Rym: So this weekend as I kept pointing out we went to we attended kind of suddenly open everything, New York City 2009 which was held in the UNICEF building, you know at the UN.

655
00:42:18,474 --> 00:42:20,620
Rym: it took us a little while to find the UNICEF building.

656
00:42:20,981 --> 00:42:24,856
Rym: Yeah, we got to see a cool UN security guard with his awesome dog sniffing for bombs.

657
00:42:25,297 --> 00:42:25,739
Rym: We found it.

658
00:42:26,201 --> 00:42:27,145
Scott: Yeah, he helped us out.

659
00:42:27,265 --> 00:42:27,707
Scott: He was cool.

660
00:42:27,928 --> 00:42:30,460
Scott: Yeah, but yeah, basically open everything.

661
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,450
Scott: It was sort of like this conference, you know, it's sort of.

662
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:39,612
Scott: they ran it like a bar camp right and just quickly Basically O'Reilly, you know of O'Reilly books.

663
00:42:39,873 --> 00:42:49,305
Scott: He ran a thing called Alright food camp, which is friends of O'Reilly camp, right and it was sort of a tech conference But it was like invitation only.

664
00:42:49,766 --> 00:42:52,212
Scott: so, you know someone else decided.

665
00:42:52,253 --> 00:42:54,980
Scott: Hey, let's run bar camp, you know food bar quucks, right?

666
00:42:55,821 --> 00:43:00,924
Scott: So bar camp was just anyone can show up we don't even have a freaking schedule right.

667
00:43:01,004 --> 00:43:09,390
Scott: and then what we do is at the beginning everyone gets together and We make the schedule and if you want to say you want to have a session You make a session.

668
00:43:09,571 --> 00:43:14,804
Scott: and if you don't want, you know if you want to just go you can go to whatever session you want and You know you.

669
00:43:14,924 --> 00:43:21,996
Scott: if you you know, you just you're supposed to move around to whatever, you know Move your feet to wherever is, you know best for you to be and it's totally.

670
00:43:22,036 --> 00:43:23,863
Scott: it's like an open Convention right?

671
00:43:23,903 --> 00:43:32,458
Scott: Imagine if you got to an anime convention and they didn't have a schedule and everyone just got together and was like You know, let's watch this at nine o'clock.

672
00:43:32,538 --> 00:43:36,013
Scott: All right Yeah, and then people who wanted to watch that at nine o'clock went and watched it.

673
00:43:36,254 --> 00:43:39,389
Scott: That's that's what a bar camp is Of course the anime con.

674
00:43:39,409 --> 00:43:40,897
Rym: it would just devolve into 400 fortune.

675
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:44,899
Scott: There's too many people at an anime con for it to for it to work, right?

676
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:57,499
Scott: But anyway at a technology booth bar camp was specifically technology related, you know It's all like open-source people talking about code and and you know hardware tech stuff.

677
00:43:58,221 --> 00:44:02,495
Scott: Open everything was about open everything, you know, I mean most of the people.

678
00:44:02,535 --> 00:44:04,080
Scott: they were technologically inclined.

679
00:44:04,462 --> 00:44:20,720
Scott: But there are also many people who are artistically inclined, you know open Movies open books Creative Commons podcast, you know everything that is open whether it is Technology or art or other information or otherwise, I mean there was even open relationships, which was kind of fun.

680
00:44:20,947 --> 00:44:21,200
Scott: Yeah.

681
00:44:21,621 --> 00:44:31,200
Scott: So it was basically anything that is open was going on here and they ran it like a bar camp where you know You make the schedule when you get there and everyone's hanging out and chillin.

682
00:44:32,122 --> 00:44:34,060
Rym: Yep, so we decided to go kind of out of nowhere.

683
00:44:34,161 --> 00:44:36,700
Rym: We didn't really know what to expect and we're not doing this.

684
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,749
Rym: You know that we're both going out of town kind of shortly.

685
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:42,057
Rym: Like I still haven't packed for my tomorrow flight.

686
00:44:42,157 --> 00:44:46,210
Rym: Yeah, but We're kind of just gonna give you our perspective.

687
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:48,320
Rym: and how much fun like what we did and our fun.

688
00:44:48,421 --> 00:44:50,940
Rym: We're not gonna do this kind of objective press thing.

689
00:44:51,981 --> 00:44:53,546
Scott: Not as we didn't really attend as press.

690
00:44:53,566 --> 00:44:54,950
Rym: we attended as people.

691
00:44:55,071 --> 00:44:57,900
Scott: Yeah, there were actually people from the Wikimedia Foundation.

692
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:59,224
Scott: I think that we're documenting.

693
00:44:59,304 --> 00:45:04,458
Rym: if you want objective press go go find the Wikimedia stuff that they filmed and the inner like.

694
00:45:04,839 --> 00:45:07,700
Rym: they will Have all the kind of legitimate information.

695
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:12,913
Scott: Yeah There's also an open an open everything NYC wiki that has info on it.

696
00:45:13,093 --> 00:45:15,860
Scott: people were documenting like all the different talks and stuff.

697
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:17,927
Rym: Yeah, I've actually got to go back in and add to that.

698
00:45:18,108 --> 00:45:19,513
Rym: Yeah, it's missing a lot, right?

699
00:45:19,533 --> 00:45:29,992
Scott: But anyway, so we get there and first they have like this little open e bit right and the guy who ran the thing talked a little bit and Then the lady from UNICEF talked and she was pretty cool.

700
00:45:30,013 --> 00:45:35,734
Scott: and then this dude Skylar something talked and he was awesome.

701
00:45:35,794 --> 00:45:36,799
Scott: He was really awesome.

702
00:45:38,062 --> 00:45:44,082
Scott: The guy was like so insightful about like the history and of all an evolution of like web Applications.

703
00:45:44,564 --> 00:45:49,940
Scott: and he ran he runs like a consultancy in Brooklyn or something like something LLC, right?

704
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:59,060
Scott: But apparently he worked with UNICEF to make like this rapid SMS thing Which is basically a web application with an SMS interface.

705
00:45:59,563 --> 00:46:04,425
Scott: So that and basically they they deploy it to places you know that need help.

706
00:46:04,606 --> 00:46:14,896
Rym: and basically what the main thing he pointed out with it isn't always obvious to people is that Africa in Particular does not have an internet infrastructure like we do.

707
00:46:14,977 --> 00:46:23,746
Rym: and I mean they have internet I mean you get Nigerian spam, but they don't have the infrastructure to where basically SMS and cell service Covers most of the continent.

708
00:46:23,987 --> 00:46:27,519
Scott: Yeah, but it's crappy old cell service, but you know, it works.

709
00:46:27,579 --> 00:46:35,824
Rym: but you know We have all these solutions for disaster relief and you know tracking information in the civil not in the like Industrialized world.

710
00:46:36,206 --> 00:46:39,700
Rym: that just the infrastructure we take for granted and our solutions kind of rely on that.

711
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:49,176
Rym: But you really need to look at what already exists in the poor places in Africa to figure out how to help these people and how to build infrastructure.

712
00:46:49,196 --> 00:46:57,784
Rym: so SMS, you know text messages on cell phones are The most reliable most pervasive infrastructure there.

713
00:46:58,245 --> 00:47:02,779
Rym: and he talked about how why don't we use that to help and why don't we use this to coordinate?

714
00:47:02,879 --> 00:47:10,096
Rym: and It's been successful to do an amazing degree and his talk was amazing And actually the slideshow he used is available on the website now.

715
00:47:10,358 --> 00:47:11,886
Scott: Yeah Yeah, I mean it's so.

716
00:47:11,906 --> 00:47:14,499
Scott: there's a lot of awesome stuff going on with rapid SMS.

717
00:47:14,861 --> 00:47:17,256
Scott: It's worth your time to to check it out.

718
00:47:17,397 --> 00:47:29,310
Scott: one thing though I sort of sort of fully realized while he was talking was you know Like the United States and the United States what we're sort of doing here is you know We're building things when we want more right.

719
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:32,300
Scott: we build things to be bigger and to have more right.

720
00:47:32,861 --> 00:47:55,211
Scott: But you know what hackers and have always been about sort of is doing more with less getting the most out of the littlest Bit, so it's sort of like in Africa, even though they have less in general It's like people are all finding ways to do more with that less and I feel like at some point Right us doing less with more and then doing more with less.

721
00:47:55,893 --> 00:47:58,958
Scott: if it keeps progressing eventually We'll both have the same amount.

722
00:47:59,422 --> 00:47:59,663
Scott: It's just.

723
00:47:59,683 --> 00:48:03,219
Scott: they'll have the same amount with less and we'll have the same amount with more.

724
00:48:03,762 --> 00:48:10,939
Scott: But if we combine the two we'll be able to do more with less, of course Yes, I think there needs to be a lot more work on doing more with less.

725
00:48:11,501 --> 00:48:19,564
Rym: But I guess the whole gist of this conference was and he the guy who ran it Britain gave a really John Britton.

726
00:48:19,604 --> 00:48:20,650
Rym: Yeah, he's.

727
00:48:20,771 --> 00:48:24,967
Rym: he summed it up very simply that Open everything is not like.

728
00:48:25,548 --> 00:48:27,774
Rym: you should read that as an imperative statement.

729
00:48:27,974 --> 00:48:45,600
Rym: open everything that in general Opening things up will always solve more problems than it will create as opposed to closing everything And that when in doubt or when there's you know, all things being equal You should have things open and you should work on things openly and collaborate openly and solve problems together in an open manner.

730
00:48:45,741 --> 00:48:49,240
Scott: Yeah as opposed to you know I mean because it's it can go two ways.

731
00:48:49,300 --> 00:49:00,408
Scott: You can go open everything as in we're going to talk about all the things that are open like open source open creative commons Right, or I can say hey Rym Yeah, you go and open everything.

732
00:49:00,568 --> 00:49:01,331
Scott: go right now.

733
00:49:01,391 --> 00:49:07,856
Scott: Go open it go like a verb a command And that's that's was like ah the tricky dual meaning.

734
00:49:07,876 --> 00:49:12,980
Rym: we are so smart Yep, and that was the kind of focus and all these initial speeches were you know.

735
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:16,013
Rym: Hey, look at all the things we did because rapid SMS and all this stuff.

736
00:49:16,535 --> 00:49:17,720
Rym: It's all open source software.

737
00:49:18,623 --> 00:49:19,269
Rym: It has to be.

738
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:20,500
Scott: it's just how well it's good.

739
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:27,525
Scott: How else could you get out and these people with no money but getting volunteers and people together and just openly solving problems?

740
00:49:27,565 --> 00:49:34,191
Rym: and they solve the problem of how do you track the distribution of DDT laced bed nets prevent malaria in Africa?

741
00:49:34,211 --> 00:49:36,600
Rym: and the answer was have people who are tracking them.

742
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:39,067
Rym: Just you send text messages back to a database.

743
00:49:39,127 --> 00:49:43,300
Scott: Yeah, like delivered three bed nets text, you know delivered five text.

744
00:49:44,102 --> 00:49:45,266
Scott: This house doesn't have one.

745
00:49:45,326 --> 00:49:49,419
Scott: send more text, you know, and then people somewhere else know what to do.

746
00:49:50,003 --> 00:49:51,050
Scott: you know you think they also.

747
00:49:51,090 --> 00:50:03,080
Scott: another cool one was the testing of kids for malnutrition malnutrition and they found that like the the like the circumference of your upper arm was like Directly related to malnutrition.

748
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:08,860
Scott: So they made a little measuring device that had red yellow and green and you would just wrap it around a kid's arm.

749
00:50:09,442 --> 00:50:14,080
Scott: See what the color, you know, what number it showed up on what the color was, you know and sent a text message.

750
00:50:14,402 --> 00:50:24,779
Scott: Kid in such-and-such village, you know Number 100 yellow and then they would message you back like, you know Cuz you don't have a doctor going to the village right a normal person.

751
00:50:25,402 --> 00:50:28,713
Scott: They would just you know get a message like, you know, give emergency rations.

752
00:50:28,813 --> 00:50:30,760
Rym: Okay, and it was all interlinked with the database.

753
00:50:30,841 --> 00:50:37,940
Rym: So the idea was that an untrained person All they need to be trained to do is send a text message and wrap a bracelet around a kid's arm.

754
00:50:38,282 --> 00:50:48,437
Rym: Yep, and then not only would they get instructions back But now the database can immediately for example say it determines, you know A percentage of children in this particular village are severely malnourished.

755
00:50:48,899 --> 00:50:56,480
Rym: now They know all right We need to send food aid to this village immediately and it gets there as fast as it can get there and you can you can.

756
00:50:57,401 --> 00:50:59,680
Scott: It's like imagine if you got a big boat full of food.

757
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:02,173
Scott: You got all these people around the world gave charity.

758
00:51:02,193 --> 00:51:03,560
Scott: You got a whole boat full of food.

759
00:51:03,862 --> 00:51:06,019
Scott: Somali pirates didn't get you you land, right?

760
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:08,696
Scott: Okay, how much food do we send?

761
00:51:08,797 --> 00:51:09,120
Scott: where?

762
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:10,623
Scott: It's not like.

763
00:51:10,664 --> 00:51:13,520
Scott: you know, the growth with his grocery stores everywhere sending in orders.

764
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:19,362
Scott: Yeah, it's it's difficult to figure out where to send and how much to send where but anyway We're.

765
00:51:19,745 --> 00:51:21,900
Rym: I don't want to get because we could do a whole show just about this.

766
00:51:22,141 --> 00:51:24,495
Rym: Oh, yeah, I really want to try to get this guy on GeekNights.

767
00:51:24,555 --> 00:51:25,340
Rym: I'd love to talk to him.

768
00:51:25,762 --> 00:51:26,405
Scott: He was really great.

769
00:51:26,726 --> 00:51:33,028
Scott: So then, you know, he sort of made the schedule and we started going a few sessions with this idea in mind.

770
00:51:33,068 --> 00:51:42,082
Rym: everyone put up their little index card of what you wanted to talk about and We had this kind of group discussions and some of them were more like lectures and some of them were more like open Discussions.

771
00:51:42,143 --> 00:51:46,120
Rym: some of them were just you know, a question was posed and everyone brought their answers to the table.

772
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:47,065
Scott: They're very they're a lot.

773
00:51:47,105 --> 00:51:53,083
Scott: They're very much more discussion II than panel II, you know When you go to like an anime convention It's a panel.

774
00:51:53,103 --> 00:52:00,571
Scott: the people at the top talk the people sitting there shut up and then or they you know But they also go woo and then at the end you ask some questions.

775
00:52:00,631 --> 00:52:01,293
Scott: maybe right?

776
00:52:01,634 --> 00:52:08,380
Scott: This is like, you know someone You know who put up the index card starts the discussion and then people start talking.

777
00:52:08,762 --> 00:52:14,108
Rym: It was very much like a salon in the classic sense Not not like a hair salon.

778
00:52:14,610 --> 00:52:17,923
Rym: If you don't know what I mean Wikipedia will tell you one thing I feel bad about.

779
00:52:17,943 --> 00:52:22,711
Scott: the very first one I went to was some guy was like write code now That's what you put on a card.

780
00:52:22,893 --> 00:52:25,950
Rym: Oh, and he didn't Was wearing an EFF shirt.

781
00:52:26,332 --> 00:52:27,075
Rym: Oh that guy was cool.

782
00:52:27,136 --> 00:52:31,035
Scott: He was he was a cool, dude It was weird cuz it was like you could tell who was cool and who wasn't cool.

783
00:52:31,096 --> 00:52:34,366
Rym: I will say this right now Almost everyone there.

784
00:52:34,386 --> 00:52:40,649
Scott: It was like 99% of the people were cool and Well, I have nothing really bad to say about anyone.

785
00:52:40,669 --> 00:52:42,415
Rym: I met there except for one person.

786
00:52:42,435 --> 00:52:43,660
Rym: We're going to talk about.

787
00:52:43,881 --> 00:52:45,411
Rym: Yeah, we're saving him for the end here.

788
00:52:45,451 --> 00:52:46,357
Scott: We are gonna save him.

789
00:52:48,264 --> 00:52:56,440
Scott: But yeah, he was you know, we tried to figure out like something to code, you know Cuz he had apparently at PyCon he had coded something cool, but it just didn't happen.

790
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,067
Scott: I sort of felt bad that it didn't happen.

791
00:52:58,107 --> 00:53:01,060
Rym: But everyone was more in a discussion mode at this point this year.

792
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:12,942
Rym: Luckily the result of all this at the end we all talked and got together and John Britton and everyone we realized that we can definitely make this a Recurring real thing in New York City.

793
00:53:13,405 --> 00:53:24,290
Scott: Oh, yeah for sure We might not get the same turnout on a more regular basis because we have more meetings You get less people at each, but I think it definitely would get enough critical mass to be something worthwhile.

794
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:26,727
Rym: Yes, but we're gonna talk about all these details later.

795
00:53:26,807 --> 00:53:29,418
Rym: I mean We're just from our perspective.

796
00:53:29,438 --> 00:53:30,945
Rym: We showed up not knowing what to expect.

797
00:53:31,327 --> 00:53:34,810
Rym: we get there You know at the early time and almost no one was there yet.

798
00:53:34,810 --> 00:53:38,230
Rym: It was all just the organizers and one of the keynote speakers was sitting there.

799
00:53:38,330 --> 00:53:43,290
Rym: So we all kind of sat around with the laptops chatting meeting people and just kind of hanging out and relaxing.

800
00:53:45,611 --> 00:53:48,080
Rym: We met one of the keynote speakers right away.

801
00:53:48,301 --> 00:53:50,670
Scott: Robert Steele you want to talk about him though?

802
00:53:51,072 --> 00:53:59,734
Rym: Uh, all I will say is that met him He was sitting there and he seemed really cool at first and he was gonna talk about open-source intelligence And I was excited about that.

803
00:53:59,815 --> 00:54:03,668
Scott: Well read read the description from the like, you know, the the.

804
00:54:03,889 --> 00:54:07,940
Rym: oh, yeah So open-source intelligence, oh, I lost my thing Robert David Steele.

805
00:54:08,461 --> 00:54:37,250
Rym: Robert David Steele the foremost proponent for open-source intelligence OSI and OS int and public intelligence in the public interest will introduce quote the other open source in combination free open source software and OS in empower the public as never before information asymmetries and data Pathologies that have been used to concentrate wealth and perpetuate poverty disease and the externalization of environmental costs as well as to promote wars That benefit the few with the expense of the many will be explained.

806
00:54:37,792 --> 00:54:42,070
Rym: Each person will receive a book yada yada yada and it seems like the whole idea here.

807
00:54:42,231 --> 00:54:42,713
Rym: There's a lot of.

808
00:54:42,834 --> 00:54:44,986
Scott: it says the guy's like a former spy, right?

809
00:54:45,207 --> 00:55:01,930
Rym: Yes It's like an actual real-deal spy is a former US spy co-founder of the US Marine Corps Intelligence Center and CEO of open-source Solutions Network as well as a pro bono CEO and angel founder of the earth intelligence network And there's a lot of charity and stuff.

810
00:55:02,151 --> 00:55:03,053
Scott: It's like this.

811
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:06,102
Scott: this totally from the description it's like man is awesome.

812
00:55:06,142 --> 00:55:13,704
Scott: this spy a real spy is gonna talk about Open-source intelligence, which is like, ooh, that's that's something I'd want to see.

813
00:55:13,884 --> 00:55:23,482
Rym: and the guy is sitting right there like he's just sitting at the table and I'm sitting at the table Scott's sitting at the table and John Britton is going around and They're like setting up the tables and all the stuff.

814
00:55:24,185 --> 00:55:27,104
Rym: and he seemed really cool And he said something and I said something.

815
00:55:27,225 --> 00:55:27,890
Rym: Scott said something.

816
00:55:27,970 --> 00:55:38,682
Rym: We're kind of having this, you know get to know each other conversation and I was really looking forward to his talk and then Like things went downhill so fast.

817
00:55:39,645 --> 00:55:42,678
Rym: I guess what I want to say is that Open everything.

818
00:55:42,699 --> 00:55:44,410
Rym: New York City was an amazing event.

819
00:55:44,551 --> 00:55:51,160
Rym: We're going to talk about the like some of the specifics in Great detail in future show and things that we discussed and learn.

820
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:51,963
Scott: there will be.

821
00:55:51,983 --> 00:55:58,542
Scott: you know things that we will you know Effect our opinions and discussions for quite some time.

822
00:55:58,722 --> 00:56:01,210
Rym: the event was amazing, but we're not really covering the event.

823
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:13,819
Rym: We're covering our experience at the event and Robert Steele in the middle of talking about You know politics and the world and so far seemed pretty intelligent In out of nowhere says and I quote.

824
00:56:14,442 --> 00:56:16,972
Rym: but as we all agree Obama He said.

825
00:56:16,992 --> 00:56:25,439
Rym: I hope everyone realizes by now that Obama is just bush in blackface and we're like and everyone Everyone at this table kind of looks at each other.

826
00:56:25,479 --> 00:56:28,390
Rym: Like did he just say what I think he just said?

827
00:56:28,992 --> 00:56:29,916
Scott: It's like what the fuck?

828
00:56:30,358 --> 00:56:36,385
Scott: and uh, he went on this tag for a little while Yeah, and basically it turned out he was one of those people where it's like.

829
00:56:36,445 --> 00:56:45,230
Scott: no matter what you say Like if I would have said, you know How as the baseball team doing he would have kept going on what he was talking about.

830
00:56:45,270 --> 00:56:49,010
Scott: He would have responded like yeah baseball team open intelligence Bush blah.

831
00:56:49,412 --> 00:56:49,915
Scott: It's like what.

832
00:56:49,955 --> 00:56:52,690
Scott: that has nothing to do with what I just said and it's like one of those people who?

833
00:56:53,251 --> 00:57:00,349
Scott: Says the thing that is their thing and can't say anything about anything else, but then I was thinking all right Maybe he's just crass.

834
00:57:00,731 --> 00:57:06,370
Rym: Maybe this point was just that you know left right the two-party system the same thing always happens in the end.

835
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:09,422
Rym: Yeah, which is I'm gonna I'm gonna let that go.

836
00:57:09,442 --> 00:57:09,824
Scott: you let.

837
00:57:09,844 --> 00:57:10,768
Scott: that guy didn't let it go.

838
00:57:10,788 --> 00:57:11,350
Scott: That was already.

839
00:57:11,711 --> 00:57:15,826
Rym: I'm going to let that go and not antagonize him.

840
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:22,476
Scott: and just oh dad I didn't want to antagonize him cuz I I was pretty sure it's crazy and I Attagonizing crazy person is a waste of.

841
00:57:22,817 --> 00:57:27,457
Rym: I was going to let him continue and see if he continued to dig the hole that he Started digging.

842
00:57:27,942 --> 00:57:28,670
Scott: Oh, yeah, he dug.

843
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:31,122
Rym: 30 seconds later the the.

844
00:57:31,383 --> 00:57:32,630
Rym: this is an exact quote.

845
00:57:33,393 --> 00:57:41,026
Rym: This will affect poor people even white people Uh-huh, two racist things out of nowhere.

846
00:57:41,046 --> 00:57:43,656
Rym: Yeah Yeah, and it good God.

847
00:57:43,676 --> 00:57:47,690
Rym: and this was one of the keynote speakers and even John Britain was kind of like yeah.

848
00:57:47,831 --> 00:57:56,134
Scott: Well afterwards John Britain told us, you know Yeah, I wasn't sure if I actually wanted to let this guy talk is apparently the guy had talked Like hope.

849
00:57:56,234 --> 00:58:00,850
Scott: right and hope is hackers on planet earth, which is sort of like the Def Con of New York.

850
00:58:00,971 --> 00:58:07,496
Scott: It's run by you know, it's sort of spawned out of 2600 magazine and such, you know, it's hope is is very respectable.

851
00:58:07,877 --> 00:58:15,746
Scott: But apparently they let this guy talk at hope and You know and John Britain had seen him there and apparently he swore a lot.

852
00:58:16,027 --> 00:58:22,139
Scott: so John was Apprehensive about letting him speak at open everything, but he did let him.

853
00:58:22,159 --> 00:58:25,749
Scott: and Yeah, good God.

854
00:58:26,231 --> 00:58:29,220
Rym: but we that aside every more people start showing up.

855
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:33,875
Rym: Alex and Jess our friends show up and the group start Farming and coalescing.

856
00:58:33,896 --> 00:58:37,450
Rym: we went to that open talk and I was real inspired by the UNICEF lady.

857
00:58:37,450 --> 00:58:39,359
Rym: Did you just like quit my job and work for UNICEF?

858
00:58:39,761 --> 00:58:48,010
Rym: Maybe I will maybe I'll email them up like It suddenly reminded me of how much I want to do stuff like that and how good of an organization UNICEF is.

859
00:58:48,313 --> 00:58:49,168
Scott: Yeah, they're pretty good.

860
00:58:49,572 --> 00:58:52,130
Rym: It's one of those things where everyone knows UNICEF does good works.

861
00:58:52,210 --> 00:59:00,218
Scott: But when you when you start to realize specifically what they do it Well, I mean you compare them to like some of the you know Not every charitable organization is equals like you.

862
00:59:00,238 --> 00:59:10,192
Scott: look around and it's like, you know, some of them are like, you know Salvation Army and then some of them are like goodwill and then some of them are like UNICEF.

863
00:59:10,212 --> 00:59:18,750
Rym: it's like oh one is clearly not like the other but we Kind of take our leave of Robert Steele and avoid him for the rest of the day.

864
00:59:18,953 --> 00:59:20,010
Scott: Oh, yes very much So.

865
00:59:20,151 --> 00:59:23,262
Rym: and then you know, we're the first round of talks and which one did you sit in on?

866
00:59:23,563 --> 00:59:25,470
Scott: I went to write code now.

867
00:59:26,096 --> 00:59:26,602
Scott: then we did

868
00:59:26,886 --> 00:59:26,967
Rym: our

869
00:59:28,371 --> 00:59:29,214
Scott: Open is inevitable

870
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:40,930
Rym: in the first round because I went to like open education and it was this like 17 year old high school punk Who was obviously really really nervous but had an interesting idea and the discussion that came out of that was really cool and the.

871
00:59:41,494 --> 00:59:43,530
Rym: This is the amazingness about these sorts of events.

872
00:59:44,272 --> 00:59:59,309
Rym: This 17 year old gives a brief talk about how like how to make high school curriculum open such that we can spread in spread education to people that can't afford it and spread it around the world and kind of give people more access to education.

873
00:59:59,509 --> 01:00:06,110
Rym: and From that and over the course of the day a Bunch of people kept like going to the same talk over and over again.

874
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:10,450
Rym: They kind of monopolized the one table all day and they ended up forming an organization.

875
01:00:10,570 --> 01:00:16,929
Rym: I forget what they called it and they're going to try to make this a real organization and try to influence curriculum in New York.

876
01:00:16,969 --> 01:00:19,457
Rym: now Yeah, so something came out of it.

877
01:00:19,517 --> 01:00:20,119
Rym: It was pretty cool.

878
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:20,882
Scott: That's pretty cool.

879
01:00:20,902 --> 01:00:30,115
Rym: I didn't notice that because I was that was separate from me Yep, but then you know after that Scott and I wanted to do something called openness is inevitable No, and we gave a little.

880
01:00:30,135 --> 01:00:34,510
Rym: we gave a little talk and then it turned into a discussion and I linked in the forums.

881
01:00:34,570 --> 01:00:39,850
Rym: They're actually surprisingly a lot of pictures of that discussion as opposed to many of the other discussions.

882
01:00:41,490 --> 01:00:50,381
Rym: Okay, like if you look at the flicker, there are a lot of pictures of that particular talk around that particular table Mm-hmm, but like in that discussion, you know certain analogies kept.

883
01:00:50,401 --> 01:00:51,866
Scott: people kept using analogies a lot.

884
01:00:51,966 --> 01:00:53,390
Scott: one analogy involved wizards.

885
01:00:53,490 --> 01:01:03,930
Rym: Yeah, we talked about how wizard like people who understand internet technology and code are fast becoming wizards And an open society will only make them more like it unto wizards.

886
01:01:04,471 --> 01:01:17,250
Scott: So this and our current society, you know, the law cannot contain, you know, it doesn't account for people with magical powers You know, so this one of the guys was really cool and was at this talk thought is really really good idea.

887
01:01:17,370 --> 01:01:20,586
Rym: So he's scheduled later in the day who will wash the wizards.

888
01:01:21,108 --> 01:01:30,434
Scott: Yeah Yeah, I think that was part of that thing that was actually good because I have a feeling that at bar camps like the schedule Gets filled right away.

889
01:01:30,454 --> 01:01:39,990
Scott: And I think it was cool that we didn't fill the whole schedule immediately that we were able to You know have empty slots and those things that we discussed right away.

890
01:01:40,070 --> 01:01:45,408
Scott: We were able to add new sessions to sort of continue those later, you know, which sort of made it.

891
01:01:46,051 --> 01:01:56,427
Scott: You know, it would have been nicer if like, you know, we could rearrange the schedule like, you know Some things down to sort of keep things together, you know Continue one session longer as opposed to end it and started again later.

892
01:01:56,447 --> 01:02:10,850
Rym: the suggestion I made that people seem to be on board with was that Instead of having just this straight-up grade with all these tables being equal We need like four different tracks One of which is like the rapid-fire 30 40 minute talks 30 40 minute talks and one of them is the like lecture hall.

893
01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:20,689
Rym: You want to do a straight-up lecture and one of them is the workshop where everyone's gonna like code something and we need to kind Of differentiate the different kinds of talks and kinds of things people want to do.

894
01:02:20,991 --> 01:02:24,830
Scott: Yep, also, I think it'd be cool if instead of break we broke it down by sessions.

895
01:02:24,910 --> 01:02:26,257
Scott: They always said these are 40 minutes.

896
01:02:26,639 --> 01:02:28,730
Scott: We need to break it down by time, you know.

897
01:02:28,810 --> 01:02:34,430
Scott: So if like I want to give a one-hour lecture, so I put in one hours of lecture another guy needs like a five-minute lecture.

898
01:02:34,530 --> 01:02:37,766
Scott: So put in a five minute, you know and just schedule it at a time.

899
01:02:37,806 --> 01:02:38,288
Scott: That's you know.

900
01:02:38,369 --> 01:02:49,202
Scott: open Why you know, there's no reason that we should have this, you know structured, you know blocks, you know We could have the the times just lined up, but it in the end it worked really well and I went to a lot of amazing talks.

901
01:02:49,262 --> 01:02:57,030
Rym: and I Look, I I was confronted with contrary opinions that were intelligently formed something that does not happen often on the internet.

902
01:02:57,333 --> 01:03:03,130
Rym: no, it does not and We're gonna have to spend a lot of shows talking about all the details of that.

903
01:03:03,210 --> 01:03:10,870
Scott: but I think mostly what it was right is we went to a place that had People who are smart like us and know about and care about the same things.

904
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:13,590
Scott: We know and care about but they're strangers.

905
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:18,570
Scott: They're people we hadn't met before and thus they had different ideas than the same old ideas.

906
01:03:18,691 --> 01:03:33,350
Scott: They keep circling around when you stay, you know in the same communities Like you stay in the front row crew you stay in the GeekNights forum community You don't really you know, you stay on slash dot you don't get you know new ideas Coming into the communities like that so often.

907
01:03:33,390 --> 01:03:38,330
Scott: But if you sit down with like ten complete strangers and talk about you all have this common interest.

908
01:03:39,353 --> 01:03:40,216
Scott: You don't know each other.

909
01:03:40,437 --> 01:03:43,346
Rym: all these strangers were all on the same basic level.

910
01:03:43,386 --> 01:03:44,490
Rym: everyone already understood.

911
01:03:44,633 --> 01:03:54,062
Scott: That's what I'm saying We're all we're all on the same page But we all had different ideas because we were from separate places and thus, you know There's a lot of valuable things that go on.

912
01:03:54,444 --> 01:04:00,130
Rym: so then cross pollination They provided a free pizza lunch and everyone kind of went outside and it was so nice.

913
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:01,600
Scott: The weather was the greatest weather.

914
01:04:01,781 --> 01:04:03,090
Scott: It should just be that weather every day.

915
01:04:03,271 --> 01:04:05,670
Rym: It was so nice that we proposed for the second half.

916
01:04:05,710 --> 01:04:08,004
Rym: Why don't we have the rest of these discussions outside?

917
01:04:08,044 --> 01:04:09,813
Rym: and everyone was like, yes There were a little.

918
01:04:09,853 --> 01:04:19,530
Scott: there are a few problems with the outside such as wind blowing things around and buses Buses and but the weather was so great that those slight inconveniences didn't matter.

919
01:04:19,891 --> 01:04:24,310
Rym: But we got a big lunch and everyone kind of mingled and talked and exchanged business cards and it was super awesome.

920
01:04:24,370 --> 01:04:29,067
Rym: And then we all went back in and Robert Steele got to give his talk.

921
01:04:29,147 --> 01:04:31,979
Scott: and I want to point I think we went outside after Robert Steele.

922
01:04:32,561 --> 01:04:32,863
Scott: did we?

923
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:34,450
Rym: yeah, I don't recall.

924
01:04:34,691 --> 01:04:36,217
Scott: It was Robert Steele then outside.

925
01:04:36,237 --> 01:04:38,326
Rym: I think it's hard to say.

926
01:04:38,346 --> 01:04:38,828
Rym: I don't remember.

927
01:04:38,848 --> 01:04:39,330
Rym: I don't remember.

928
01:04:39,791 --> 01:04:44,366
Rym: I'm pretty sure we ate then we went inside had Robert Steele and then we had the lectures outside.

929
01:04:44,386 --> 01:04:51,450
Scott: I Feel like we went down to Robert Steele then went outside and then the pizza showed up and then I don't remember.

930
01:04:51,811 --> 01:04:55,306
Rym: Regardless Robert Steele, I'm gonna be open.

931
01:04:55,326 --> 01:04:59,990
Scott: This guy is crazy Like he's a crazy crazy conspiracy nut job.

932
01:05:00,151 --> 01:05:07,018
Rym: We all go back in and we have this we sit around in the big lecture hall where the UNICEF lady talked And Shayler talked and Skyler Skyler.

933
01:05:07,258 --> 01:05:08,743
Rym: It's spelled not like Skyler.

934
01:05:08,823 --> 01:05:09,345
Scott: I know right?

935
01:05:09,385 --> 01:05:10,468
Rym: Yeah, it messes me up.

936
01:05:10,528 --> 01:05:23,844
Scott: It does and He says blackface again within 30 seconds and no sentence He said had anything to do with any other sentence He said and his graphic design of his slides were that crazy conspiracy.

937
01:05:23,864 --> 01:05:24,647
Scott: graphic design

938
01:05:24,727 --> 01:05:42,079
Rym: some sort of research It might have already been done needs to be put into the fact that Conspiracy theory crazy people all use the same graphic design those Really dense graphs that don't make any sense at all and all these lines like pointing at each other and all these arbitrary Distinctions between two different things that don't make sense.

939
01:05:42,781 --> 01:05:42,941
Rym: Mm-hmm.

940
01:05:43,102 --> 01:05:53,295
Rym: Maybe there's something with a paranoid mind, but Basically, we're sitting in the front row, you know front row crew and I have my laptop and I'm furiously taking notes as to how Crazy, this guy is.

941
01:05:53,676 --> 01:06:00,714
Rym: and periodically Scott will I grab my hand and like type something on my laptop At one point because he didn't want to say anything out loud, you know And we didn't want to.

942
01:06:00,915 --> 01:06:03,787
Scott: we didn't want to like antagonize him because he ever you're this crazy guy.

943
01:06:03,807 --> 01:06:04,550
Scott: He's already crazy.

944
01:06:04,891 --> 01:06:07,380
Scott: It's like, you know, it's really.

945
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:08,685
Scott: there's nothing I could say to him.

946
01:06:08,725 --> 01:06:09,970
Scott: That would be productive in any way.

947
01:06:10,231 --> 01:06:12,299
Scott: All it would do is make him crazier and go.

948
01:06:12,319 --> 01:06:15,392
Scott: it would just make everything bad and I don't want to do that There's.

949
01:06:15,452 --> 01:06:19,310
Scott: no it's like I just I just want him to go away and be quiet and that be the end of it.

950
01:06:19,410 --> 01:06:21,150
Scott: You know, I buy this crazy person away.

951
01:06:22,051 --> 01:06:23,258
Scott: So he didn't want to say anything.

952
01:06:23,278 --> 01:06:24,224
Scott: We don't ask a question.

953
01:06:24,244 --> 01:06:25,190
Scott: We don't want to make a comment.

954
01:06:25,230 --> 01:06:26,314
Scott: We didn't want to start a debate.

955
01:06:26,414 --> 01:06:29,143
Rym: So after his third crazy graph came up.

956
01:06:29,744 --> 01:06:31,309
Rym: I type time cube.

957
01:06:31,832 --> 01:06:32,816
Rym: I'm sure you all know how.

958
01:06:32,856 --> 01:06:35,890
Rym: time cube and I showed to Scott and Scott's like, oh my god.

959
01:06:35,990 --> 01:06:38,865
Rym: We showed to Alex and Jess and we're all on the same page there.

960
01:06:39,167 --> 01:06:51,396
Rym: We realize Independently of us in the other like section of seats Someone else had a piece of paper who's taking notes and he just wrote time cube on it and held it up for everyone behind it.

961
01:06:53,210 --> 01:06:58,475
Rym: So the whole time we're thinking like praying is Everyone on the same page?

962
01:06:58,495 --> 01:07:01,505
Scott: because I mean we're sitting there and we talked to each other and we're like.

963
01:07:01,526 --> 01:07:05,784
Scott: I hope Everyone else in this room thinks he's a crazy conspiracy nut.

964
01:07:05,845 --> 01:07:09,599
Scott: right like no one's like I'm one cuz there are you know, crazy conspiracy people.

965
01:07:09,659 --> 01:07:12,770
Scott: someone who is seemingly intelligent might be a conspiracy nut.

966
01:07:12,850 --> 01:07:13,854
Rym: No one's challenging him.

967
01:07:13,894 --> 01:07:15,119
Rym: Everyone's just kind of letting him talk.

968
01:07:15,159 --> 01:07:17,910
Rym: People are laughing politely when he you know says something funny.

969
01:07:17,910 --> 01:07:18,895
Rym: He said a few funny things.

970
01:07:18,956 --> 01:07:19,478
Scott: He did he did.

971
01:07:19,498 --> 01:07:23,596
Rym: he had a few couple funny jokes, but uh At the end we're all walking out.

972
01:07:23,797 --> 01:07:27,570
Rym: Of course, and I remember I walk out and I turned to the cool lady.

973
01:07:27,630 --> 01:07:28,635
Rym: I forget everyone's names.

974
01:07:28,716 --> 01:07:36,550
Rym: I'm sorry, but cool girl like number four Yep, and I look at her and she looks at me and I was like are we on the same page?

975
01:07:36,730 --> 01:07:39,280
Rym: And she says I think we're on the same page.

976
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:43,615
Rym: and then she turns the guy she was walking out with and he's like That guy was crazy.

977
01:07:43,635 --> 01:07:46,984
Scott: Yeah, and like there was there was one guy there.

978
01:07:47,064 --> 01:07:49,230
Scott: He was cool, but he definitely had one of those.

979
01:07:50,322 --> 01:07:53,117
Scott: You know Situations, you know, what's it called?

980
01:07:53,137 --> 01:07:54,161
Scott: Like one of the syndromes?

981
01:07:54,201 --> 01:07:55,485
Scott: I don't know which one but didn't matter.

982
01:07:55,987 --> 01:07:57,554
Scott: and you know Even that guy.

983
01:07:57,635 --> 01:08:02,861
Scott: he was like nothing that guy said Made any sense whatsoever.

984
01:08:02,881 --> 01:08:17,990
Rym: the best the dude who was taking notes specifically for the wiki is Standing there after with his laptop and he's holding it and he's looking at it and he looks up and just kind of says to The room there is no possible way to summarize anything that that man said.

985
01:08:21,794 --> 01:08:23,255
Scott: Yeah, I Mean I was like.

986
01:08:23,274 --> 01:08:25,990
Scott: there are people that I sort of got to know a little bit, you know.

987
01:08:26,171 --> 01:08:29,970
Scott: But you know you hang out with someone for a few hours, you know and people stand out.

988
01:08:30,029 --> 01:08:30,453
Scott: So I like.

989
01:08:30,514 --> 01:08:38,828
Scott: I sort of looked at everyone who I sort of you know came to recognize over the course of the morning and I was like I was like mmm and they were like.

990
01:08:40,572 --> 01:08:40,995
Scott: I'm sort of like.

991
01:08:41,095 --> 01:08:42,183
Scott: I like are we cool?

992
01:08:42,203 --> 01:08:42,807
Scott: He's like we're cool.

993
01:08:44,693 --> 01:08:46,127
Scott: Just try to make sure who's cool.

994
01:08:47,103 --> 01:08:59,904
Rym: But It was amazing Like to give you an example at one point like after the ninth crazy graph comes up I stopped writing crazy graph because I kept noting crazy graph crazy graph.

995
01:08:59,944 --> 01:09:02,069
Rym: eventually, you know, alright, there's no more.

996
01:09:02,511 --> 01:09:07,165
Rym: I can't even begin to describe these graphs, but he has the graph.

997
01:09:07,185 --> 01:09:14,193
Rym: that's talking about the differences between harmonized giving and And Organized giving.

998
01:09:14,493 --> 01:09:23,350
Rym: and there was a heart on one of them and like an ex on one of them and the lines were pointing past Each other and there was a pig and uh, but then he stops and he talks to me.

999
01:09:23,612 --> 01:09:25,670
Rym: He's up 9/11 and I put I'm like, huh?

1000
01:09:25,790 --> 01:09:28,259
Rym: And I pull up his Wikipedia page and then the discussion.

1001
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:37,526
Rym: someone's like this guy is a crazy 9/11 conspiracy nut and I'm like Oh boy, here we go and he says and a sentence that in and of itself is relatively benign.

1002
01:09:38,209 --> 01:09:46,010
Rym: in the Best case scenario the September 11th attacks and the 9/11 Commission were a gross oversight and gross negligence.

1003
01:09:46,310 --> 01:09:48,055
Scott: No, yeah gross and confidence.

1004
01:09:48,095 --> 01:09:50,843
Scott: I think he said and that that that's alright.

1005
01:09:51,344 --> 01:09:52,506
Scott: That's about you know,

1006
01:09:52,747 --> 01:10:08,564
Rym: and then in the span of 45 seconds he reminds us that Kennedy was murdered by the Cubans in revenge for the Bay of Pigs and this is documented by the way and that Martin Luther King was killed by an FBI sniper as we all know.

1007
01:10:08,584 --> 01:10:17,430
Rym: and of course then Good guy Like he went off the often like he was already off the deep end and he found another deep end to go off the deeper.

1008
01:10:18,033 --> 01:10:21,309
Scott: And that's like if you were already in the bottom of a swimming pool, right?

1009
01:10:21,650 --> 01:10:28,252
Scott: But the swimming pool was right next to the the fault in the bottom of the ocean and there was a diving board Underwater.

1010
01:10:28,272 --> 01:10:32,685
Scott: and he jumped on the underwater diving board and dove deeper under the water.

1011
01:10:32,906 --> 01:10:39,095
Rym: and then he said and I quote World War three began in 1988 Uh-huh, and then that was.

1012
01:10:39,155 --> 01:10:40,520
Rym: that was when Scott grabbed my laptop.

1013
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:41,945
Rym: He had something to type any types.

1014
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:46,989
Rym: I have to pee Because we stopped paying attention to this guy at this point.

1015
01:10:47,402 --> 01:10:53,750
Rym: Yeah And the only other thing I really want to point out is that then he pulls out his beret for the earth rescue circle.

1016
01:10:54,011 --> 01:10:54,794
Scott: That was funny though.

1017
01:10:55,055 --> 01:10:58,387
Rym: It was a pretty cool beret, but oh my god.

1018
01:10:58,407 --> 01:11:03,186
Rym: Yeah Oh my god, and of course one planet one God one way.

1019
01:11:03,226 --> 01:11:04,170
Rym: He's kind of religious, too.

1020
01:11:04,272 --> 01:11:06,182
Scott: Yeah anyway, the.

1021
01:11:07,592 --> 01:11:12,734
Scott: The one thing though is I started to read his crazy book, which was free by the way I didn't even take a copy.

1022
01:11:12,794 --> 01:11:13,377
Scott: Rym took a cop.

1023
01:11:13,397 --> 01:11:15,365
Rym: He gave us all a copy of his hardcover book.

1024
01:11:15,606 --> 01:11:23,064
Scott: Yeah, okay You know and I think that you know, of course, he's a crazy conspiracy nut, right?

1025
01:11:23,485 --> 01:11:36,930
Scott: But there is sort of this one idea maybe buried that he's just Incapable of Communicating properly because he's crazy and that you know really is that you know right now.

1026
01:11:37,110 --> 01:11:40,043
Scott: Intelligence in terms of you know government intelligence, right?

1027
01:11:40,083 --> 01:11:41,830
Scott: It's all about like keeping secrets, right?

1028
01:11:42,030 --> 01:11:42,914
Scott: Oh the CIA knows that.

1029
01:11:42,955 --> 01:11:43,638
Scott: no one else knows.

1030
01:11:43,698 --> 01:11:45,910
Scott: that way they can get ahead right in the in.

1031
01:11:45,990 --> 01:11:47,587
Scott: You know the games the government's play.

1032
01:11:48,851 --> 01:11:54,870
Scott: And he's saying really what you need is, you know, all the raw information is open, right?

1033
01:11:55,271 --> 01:11:58,583
Scott: It's no longer about the secrets you have that someone else doesn't have.

1034
01:11:58,964 --> 01:12:17,570
Scott: it's now about you know Your ability to analyze the information to collect it and aggregate it and analyze it and all that You know, he's like, you know in in one of the chapters in the book I read barely any of it but he talks about how like how come we haven't translated all these documents in Arabic and I don't know what documents he's talking about.

1035
01:12:17,611 --> 01:12:20,095
Scott: he's probably crazy but It's true.

1036
01:12:20,116 --> 01:12:22,170
Scott: It's like why haven't we translated everything?

1037
01:12:22,250 --> 01:12:23,575
Scott: You know, it's we need to.

1038
01:12:23,736 --> 01:12:31,825
Scott: you know, if we're gonna have open all this open information then Intelligence is no longer going to be about spying and uncovering secrets.

1039
01:12:32,227 --> 01:12:46,109
Scott: It's gonna be about waiting in this big pool of you know information that everyone has access to and figuring it out and making the sense of it and creating the intelligence from that data.

1040
01:12:46,129 --> 01:12:49,067
Scott: and you know, that's sort of right.

1041
01:12:49,088 --> 01:12:56,690
Scott: and And Yeah, I don't know But he and all the other thing that he's sort of right about be still being crazy.

1042
01:12:57,071 --> 01:12:57,372
Scott: Is that

1043
01:12:58,054 --> 01:12:58,155
Rym: if

1044
01:12:58,255 --> 01:13:11,290
Scott: all that raw data is completely open and you fight for it to be that way and it is that way Then that can somehow Restore the integrity of the government because you know people can say hey you're wrong because you know the government right now, right?

1045
01:13:11,450 --> 01:13:16,533
Scott: Look, they come around and say oh we're doing this and they say we have to do this because of something secret We can't tell you.

1046
01:13:16,573 --> 01:13:20,128
Scott: Well, if there are no secrets the government can't get away with that anymore.

1047
01:13:20,529 --> 01:13:31,180
Rym: now I have one tiny hope that I'm I'm so sure is not the case, but it would be amazing If this guy were just nanny Kaufman, that would be amazing.

1048
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:35,050
Rym: Like if he were just pulling all of our legs.

1049
01:13:35,451 --> 01:13:38,602
Rym: I know that's probably not the case, but it's almost definitely not the case.

1050
01:13:38,642 --> 01:13:43,770
Scott: and look at how many books he's done and such he's This man Robert Steele.

1051
01:13:44,412 --> 01:13:49,247
Rym: Do not let him speak at any event that you ever run because he's he will.

1052
01:13:49,267 --> 01:13:52,938
Rym: he will talk about Speaking at your event as though you endorsed him.

1053
01:13:52,978 --> 01:13:56,630
Scott: now here allow me to become a conspiracy nut myself for a mere moment.

1054
01:13:57,159 --> 01:14:00,626
Scott: what if When this he was a CIA spy right or something like?

1055
01:14:00,646 --> 01:14:01,349
Rym: what if he knew stuff?

1056
01:14:01,830 --> 01:14:02,753
Scott: What if he knew stuff?

1057
01:14:02,833 --> 01:14:15,405
Scott: and the CIA has a way of turning people into crazy conspiracy nuts where they will tell the truth But their minds are fucked up in some way to where they make crazy graphs and say things in a crazy way So no one believes them.

1058
01:14:16,892 --> 01:14:25,348
Scott: See, I've explained his crazy conspiracy nuttiness with a further crazy conspiracy That I don't think it's true in any way.

1059
01:14:26,571 --> 01:14:31,490
Scott: Cuz I'm not a crazy conspiracy nut, but do not let him talk.

1060
01:14:31,912 --> 01:14:33,057
Rym: He is crazy.

1061
01:14:33,117 --> 01:14:38,942
Scott: unless you want some epic lolz stay far away Yes, but the thing is he was well-meaning.

1062
01:14:39,182 --> 01:14:46,330
Rym: that's the one thing we can say from the guy clearly Really cares about the world and really cares about people and wants to make the world a better place.

1063
01:14:46,491 --> 01:14:46,954
Scott: And he's like.

1064
01:14:46,974 --> 01:14:49,230
Scott: he doesn't want war he wants peace.

1065
01:14:49,330 --> 01:14:50,515
Scott: He wants to you know help.

1066
01:14:50,555 --> 01:14:55,350
Rym: he's just trying to make the world a better place with crazy graphs exactly.

1067
01:14:56,451 --> 01:15:04,570
Rym: But after that and after everyone collectively went outside and went wow Wow This weather is great and that guy's crazy.

1068
01:15:05,132 --> 01:15:08,670
Rym: Then we went back in we had our afternoon of sessions, and it was super awesome.

1069
01:15:09,272 --> 01:15:13,590
Rym: And then we had the final talk Leslie Hawthorne who is pretty cool.

1070
01:15:13,731 --> 01:15:16,126
Rym: She's the Google summer of code person.

1071
01:15:16,328 --> 01:15:17,873
Rym: yep She talked.

1072
01:15:18,134 --> 01:15:30,514
Rym: she gave a really short concise talk about how this kind of open source software Stuff can be used to make people respond to problems, and I don't really want to summarize our whole talk But it was really cool.

1073
01:15:30,615 --> 01:15:31,319
Rym: She was really cool.

1074
01:15:31,521 --> 01:15:37,786
Scott: Yep, and she didn't have any slides Which is kind of crazy cuz like we had the most slide II person you could ever have.

1075
01:15:37,806 --> 01:15:41,243
Rym: I like his delivery I wanted and then someone who was anti slide.

1076
01:15:41,444 --> 01:15:49,625
Rym: cuz we're so used to the TED talk like we're trying to make all of our panels be like TED talks you have like the few I'm not talking about I'm talking about steel was slide.

1077
01:15:49,686 --> 01:15:51,773
Rym: I was talking about Rapid SMS.

1078
01:15:52,054 --> 01:15:54,562
Scott: Skylar had good slides, but he had that rapid fire.

1079
01:15:54,803 --> 01:15:59,680
Rym: slide slide slide slide slide slide slide slide Really makes this cool kind of narrative.

1080
01:15:59,881 --> 01:16:02,089
Scott: yeah, it helps with the low attention span.

1081
01:16:02,129 --> 01:16:04,597
Rym: also It's a different kind of talk.

1082
01:16:04,677 --> 01:16:09,665
Rym: I think and I think they both have their place, but no Leslie was like you know what fucks lives Let's go.

1083
01:16:10,553 --> 01:16:26,730
Scott: Yeah, but I do think Actually because I was talking to this cool guy who doesn't who runs the e-book company right and basically what he does is he takes He'll like take all the ebooks related to medicine put him together into an e-book library and sell it to doctors.

1084
01:16:27,132 --> 01:16:29,810
Scott: Or he'll make an e-book law library and sell it to lawyers.

1085
01:16:30,151 --> 01:16:33,823
Scott: And he says now you can have the law in the palm of your hand.

1086
01:16:33,843 --> 01:16:35,649
Scott: You know it's sort of like a ha ha ha ha.

1087
01:16:36,156 --> 01:16:44,350
Scott: You know So anyway what that guy was talking about was I sort of lost my train of thought a little bit here.

1088
01:16:46,072 --> 01:16:51,525
Scott: Yeah He talked about how you know if you're learning right trying to learn something.

1089
01:16:51,545 --> 01:16:55,057
Scott: if you read something Once you remember X percent.

1090
01:16:55,177 --> 01:16:58,710
Scott: if you if you have something read to you you remember X percent.

1091
01:16:59,091 --> 01:17:04,612
Scott: But if you read and have it read to you at the same time you remember like 80%.

1092
01:17:04,612 --> 01:17:09,110
Scott: And I think what Schuyler did in his slideshow right by having the rapid-fire slides.

1093
01:17:09,693 --> 01:17:12,610
Scott: It's like when he would list like you know four things.

1094
01:17:12,891 --> 01:17:16,930
Scott: He had four slides with one word each and as he said them he showed the slides.

1095
01:17:16,930 --> 01:17:19,590
Scott: It was like word slide word slide word slide.

1096
01:17:20,051 --> 01:17:23,844
Scott: You get the reading to you and the reading of your own at the same time.

1097
01:17:24,205 --> 01:17:26,937
Scott: for that 80% learning You know all right.

1098
01:17:26,977 --> 01:17:28,787
Rym: We've gone on way too long.

1099
01:17:28,807 --> 01:17:29,290
Rym: That's all right.

1100
01:17:29,290 --> 01:17:30,098
Scott: We need a long show.

1101
01:17:30,118 --> 01:17:32,133
Scott: if we're not gonna do shows the rest of the week We're gonna wrap this up.

1102
01:17:32,213 --> 01:17:37,880
Rym: suffice it to say we will be talking about open everything and some of these specific Topics and talks that happened.

1103
01:17:38,866 --> 01:17:43,830
Rym: in the future We're going to try to become a big part of this going forward because it was super awesome.

1104
01:17:43,870 --> 01:17:49,150
Scott: Yeah, we definitely need to make some more inroads into the the tech openness communities.

1105
01:17:49,794 --> 01:17:51,403
Rym: Everyone there was super awesome.

1106

Rym: the ideas that were tossed around were great.

1108
01:17:55,720 --> 01:18:10,415
Rym: Everyone's really gung-ho to make the world a better place and afterward we all like totally hung out and while the after party had some trouble because the Proprietor of McFadden's bar is a luddite as far as I can tell yeah, I just failed at everything Ever.

1109
01:18:10,557 --> 01:18:18,033
Rym: everyone I talked to Was super awesome and all of you out there who are probably listening to this because you got one of my flyers or met me Or we talked.
