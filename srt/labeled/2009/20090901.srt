Rym: packs is coming all week.

13
00:00:42,761 --> 00:00:43,966
Rym: I'm just not doing anything to work.

14
00:00:44,006 --> 00:00:45,050
Rym: I'm just thinking about packs.

15
00:00:45,331 --> 00:00:47,056
Scott: It's so weird like other conventions.

16
00:00:47,137 --> 00:00:50,487
Scott: It's like you know a kind of excited about him leading up to it.

17
00:00:50,568 --> 00:00:51,250
Scott: It's like packs.

18
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:56,106
Scott: I've been like yeah, fuck their packs is coming like weeks ago, and I think it's a different.

19
00:00:56,146 --> 00:00:57,350
Rym: like two three days.

20
00:00:57,693 --> 00:01:13,265
Rym: I'm excited about packs the way I used to be excited about things like Otakon you know in the early days of cons when Like every like being an attendee and nothing more was just crazy and amazing and like walk into a dealer's room and oh my god There's 26,000 nerds, but you know anime cons for us are about 75% work.

21
00:01:13,286 --> 00:01:13,346
Rym: now.

22
00:01:15,351 --> 00:01:19,765
Scott: Well packs is work too, but you know what packs is just so great.

23
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:21,170
Scott: I would the greatest of the greats.

24
00:01:22,272 --> 00:01:28,770
Rym: One of the only regrets and now we have two in my entire life Is that I did not go to a pack sooner?

25
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:36,318
Scott: I would have had to suffer to go to those packs as we we considered it is when they announced that first packs We're like let's go no matter what.

26
00:01:36,418 --> 00:01:42,782
Scott: but we didn't yeah because we didn't have enough money, and then the next year We're like let's go no matter what and eventually we went no matter what.

27
00:01:43,084 --> 00:01:44,650
Scott: last year far too late.

28
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,398
Scott: We should have gone no matter what much much earlier.

29
00:01:47,418 --> 00:01:49,063
Rym: It's very few things.

30
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:51,269
Scott: how things have turned out then.

31
00:01:52,034 --> 00:01:53,706
Scott: Otakon might be mailing badges already.

32
00:01:53,928 --> 00:02:00,863
Rym: Yep Just imagine going to that early packs is only what like 3,000 feet.

33
00:02:00,884 --> 00:02:02,088
Scott: yeah the early packs is.

34
00:02:02,108 --> 00:02:07,328
Scott: people don't realize We're not that large, but this packs Sold the fuck out.

35
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:12,410
Scott: Zero back no badges for sale at the door game over.

36
00:02:12,951 --> 00:02:14,917
Scott: You're either going or you're not.

37
00:02:14,977 --> 00:02:16,762
Scott: if you're not going you suck.

38
00:02:16,962 --> 00:02:18,907
Rym: you do need those stinking badges.

39
00:02:19,609 --> 00:02:27,207
Rym: of course you know I'm not to make fun of people but If you don't know Jared emailed us today, and he's like yeah, I forgot to pre-reg.

40
00:02:27,428 --> 00:02:27,970
Rym: he sucks.

41
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:36,006
Scott: I mean if you edge if you wanted to go you're planning on going and now you're not going because you don't have a badge You suck.

42
00:02:36,912 --> 00:02:37,755
Rym: In

43
00:02:37,775 --> 00:02:48,830
Scott: a situation like you live in the middle of Kansas, and you wanted to go if you have no money well You know that you don't suck, but if you wanted to go and the only reason you're not going is cuz you waited too long To pre-reg hope you learn your lesson.

44
00:02:49,751 --> 00:02:52,785
Scott: What do you edge the day the badges go on sale.

45
00:02:53,046 --> 00:02:53,890
Scott: do not hesitate?

46
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:59,560
Scott: Well unless you're like us we will save money And you won't be a chump like how many people go.

47
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,286
Scott: look on Twitter see how many chumps there are.

48
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:04,795
Scott: go to the packs forums For like Want badges.

49
00:03:04,815 --> 00:03:05,700
Rym: then there are badges.

50
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:09,215
Rym: They're going to be jumps no matter what.

51
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:15,529
Rym: people could have all registered on day one and then hour to day one It'd be the same number of jumps.

52
00:03:15,937 --> 00:03:17,373
Scott: That's right You got it.

53
00:03:17,413 --> 00:03:30,346
Scott: if you don't want to be a chump if someone told me that they were there as soon as the announcement was made Constantly refreshing the page and trying to buy a badge immediately And they sold out and they weren't able to get one then they are not a chump.

54
00:03:30,527 --> 00:03:31,611
Rym: the thing is it's funny How it.

55
00:03:31,631 --> 00:03:34,743
Rym: other cons like on the artist alley registration is like that.

56
00:03:34,783 --> 00:03:39,550
Rym: there are people who refresh that thing Register within like a minute, and you know what it's like.

57
00:03:39,751 --> 00:03:40,694
Scott: It's like back in the day.

58
00:03:40,774 --> 00:03:41,899
Scott: try two things I can.

59
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,990
Scott: I can equate it to number one registering for classes at RIT.

60
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:47,930
Rym: When you're a measly freshman, you know I never had to go through that.

61
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,119
Rym: That's one of the few other than my first.

62
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:53,019
Rym: I only had to do it like a couple times at RIT when I didn't know better.

63
00:03:53,732 --> 00:03:54,574
Rym: Remember I I was.

64
00:03:54,594 --> 00:03:55,597
Rym: I was like uh-huh.

65
00:03:55,778 --> 00:03:58,265
Scott: anyway the number two thing I can relate it to.

66
00:03:58,626 --> 00:04:04,089
Scott: the number two thing is Trying to get the newest version to counter-strike the day it comes out.

67
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:04,857
Rym: You know what.

68
00:04:04,998 --> 00:04:06,150
Rym: I never had to deal with that either.

69
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:11,350
Rym: You just waited till the next day because you would always get it And then I would just take it off like your windows share.

70
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:14,163
Scott: I don't remember ever giving it to you, and I didn't have a windows share.

71
00:04:14,183 --> 00:04:15,550
Rym: I would get it from you.

72
00:04:15,851 --> 00:04:20,168
Rym: I don't usually because you'd be like hey you want to play counter-strike, and I'd be like I didn't download the patch.

73
00:04:20,189 --> 00:04:20,329
Rym: yet.

74
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:22,239
Scott: I don't remember ever giving you a counter-strike.

75
00:04:22,299 --> 00:04:24,229
Scott: I remember everyone waiting in line, okay?

76
00:04:24,652 --> 00:04:26,250
Scott: I think in random mirrors until it worked.

77
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,978
Rym: I usually wait until someone else got it then just so people.

78
00:04:29,059 --> 00:04:32,670
Scott: people don't appreciate how great steam is just automatically updating your shit.

79
00:04:32,832 --> 00:04:34,050
Scott: You know with no bullshit.

80
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:40,290
Scott: You don't remember the days of counter-strike updates like you know trying to get beta 9 and when beta 8 was your current version.

81
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:40,792
Scott: You know what.

82
00:04:40,812 --> 00:04:41,816
Rym: that wasn't the problem.

83
00:04:41,836 --> 00:04:45,370
Rym: that wasn't the part that bothered me because like I said I never waited those stupid lines.

84
00:04:45,491 --> 00:04:47,969
Rym: I just waited for some other chump to get it for me.

85
00:04:48,351 --> 00:04:49,820
Scott: I didn't you wasn't me Greg.

86
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,650
Rym: I always got someone to do it anyway.

87
00:04:52,032 --> 00:04:55,050
Rym: But the plus RIT you could get it off a direct connect.

88
00:04:55,653 --> 00:04:58,307
Rym: Yeah, like within an hour not freshman year directing.

89
00:04:58,327 --> 00:04:58,870
Scott: that came later.

90
00:04:59,612 --> 00:05:01,901
Scott: The problem was by that time steam was out.

91
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:12,458
Rym: the problem was that RIT that once they release an update like half the servers be running different versions and half the servers wouldn't work in the server side would be A mess for like a week after the update.

92
00:05:12,518 --> 00:05:13,020
Scott: that was true.

93
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:23,189
Rym: Everyone would jump on to like the three servers that I had At the right very but at the same time as it moved you'd see the servers that didn't move getting more and more full as People who didn't have the update yet had to move to them.

94
00:05:23,581 --> 00:05:27,102
Scott: Yeah As they had to play while they're waiting the update to download plus half the servers.

95
00:05:27,142 --> 00:05:31,137
Rym: then like the admin mods wouldn't work anymore And you couldn't kick people.

96
00:05:31,157 --> 00:05:33,566
Rym: you'd have admins like breaking into patches.

97
00:05:33,787 --> 00:05:34,670
Rym: It was it was crazy.

98
00:05:35,132 --> 00:05:37,481
Scott: Alright, so check out some video game news.

99
00:05:37,501 --> 00:05:39,429
Rym: you ready for this, and I'm ready alright.

100
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:45,448
Scott: So Rym when you go to the arcade right and you're playing the what there's no such thing as arcades.

101
00:05:45,508 --> 00:05:50,949
Scott: when you go to fun Spot or the the you mean when I go to a video or you go to video topia.

102
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,095
Scott: Yes, it is video.

103
00:05:52,135 --> 00:05:55,070
Scott: topia by the way is in the Rochester strong music?

104
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,677
Scott: I think is it the strong museum of fun?

105
00:05:56,757 --> 00:06:02,940
Rym: so like I was about to say if I go to a museum Fun spots not a museum anyway effectively it is anyway.

106
00:06:03,341 --> 00:06:09,643
Scott: if you go to an arcade with the old-school games What are your old-school games that you play?

107
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:09,683
Scott: I?

108
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,555
Rym: Don't know all of them.

109
00:06:12,595 --> 00:06:12,796
Scott: Well.

110
00:06:12,836 --> 00:06:16,210
Scott: No like the games that are rims games like root beer tappers.

111
00:06:16,872 --> 00:06:19,020
Scott: And you know cinestar is not your game.

112
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:19,943
Rym: I like cinestar.

113
00:06:20,204 --> 00:06:21,690
Scott: You know, but it's not your game root beer.

114
00:06:21,911 --> 00:06:23,344
Scott: I think your games are root beer tapper.

115
00:06:23,364 --> 00:06:24,050
Rym: Here's the difference.

116
00:06:24,271 --> 00:06:27,787
Rym: Do you mean my game as in the games that I was transcendently good at?

117
00:06:27,908 --> 00:06:28,410
Rym: yeah somehow?

118
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:31,321
Scott: Yes, root beer tapper root beer tapper miss pac-man.

119
00:06:31,341 --> 00:06:32,405
Rym: That's pretty much it right.

120
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:33,650
Rym: well ramparts later.

121
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:34,956
Rym: I don't even consider that old-school.

122
00:06:35,056 --> 00:06:36,744
Scott: I consider rampart old-school.

123
00:06:36,885 --> 00:06:37,930
Rym: I don't know what to consider it.

124
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,608
Rym: It's so middle school Horton to my life.

125
00:06:41,294 --> 00:06:43,149
Scott: Anyway, so what are my games?

126
00:06:44,594 --> 00:06:45,802
Rym: Uh, what are your games?

127
00:06:46,264 --> 00:06:49,877
Scott: mega man to Arcade games of the old-school flavor.

128
00:06:49,897 --> 00:06:51,140
Rym: I don't know.

129
00:06:52,172 --> 00:06:56,430
Scott: I consider my game to be Galaga even though I'm not a master of Scott likes.

130
00:06:56,551 --> 00:06:59,207
Rym: Oh, yeah, so there's that the new champion of Galaga.

131
00:06:59,227 --> 00:06:59,859
Scott: That's correct Yeah.

132
00:07:00,612 --> 00:07:05,846
Scott: So previously the champion of Galaga was Andrew Laidlaw from the United States with 2.7 million points.

133
00:07:07,992 --> 00:07:16,642
Scott: Some dude in Australia named Phil day has three point forty four million points Holy craps, and basically all he did.

134
00:07:16,662 --> 00:07:18,450
Scott: he's been playing it since he was seven years old.

135
00:07:18,937 --> 00:07:31,289
Scott: He had a machine He trained like intensely for six months out in the you know who knows middle of nowhere and the outback right and then He put up the video camera because people don't know right.

136
00:07:32,712 --> 00:07:48,730
Scott: Twin galaxies is the like official video game high score keeping organization And you can either register your high score in the presence of a twin galaxies referee or You can do it via video tape where you basically videotape your machine to prove that it's the real deal.

137
00:07:49,031 --> 00:08:05,154
Scott: Then videotape your entire play session and you know the whole and then mail your videotape to twin galaxies for them to verify that You didn't like photoshop it and such and so he chose the videotape method and he did it like just all on his own and his house with his machine and You know.

138
00:08:05,175 --> 00:08:07,321
Rym: basically I wonder how many attempts that took.

139
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:11,613
Rym: like you wonder you know eight hours into his fourth session Fuck the.

140
00:08:11,814 --> 00:08:25,522
Scott: the interesting thing that they said about it was that you know when he crossed the high score point He just kept going and he was just sort of in a daze and he was real exhausted so that you didn't have he didn't Like celebrate or go like yeah when he passed the point He just kept going until he died and then he was like who?

141
00:08:26,386 --> 00:08:28,255
Scott: I haven't seen the video though But that's what they.

142
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:31,310
Rym: that's what there's something about that zone and every gamer has it.

143
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,366
Rym: I mean even playing DDR.

144
00:08:32,711 --> 00:08:36,568
Rym: You know you'll be playing and you get to a point to where you realize that you're not even looking at the arrows.

145
00:08:36,609 --> 00:08:39,380
Rym: your feet Are just kind of moving yep, and you're getting them all.

146
00:08:39,621 --> 00:08:43,356
Scott: one thing that really interested me though is like you know You know what a Galaga machine looks like.

147
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:53,095
Scott: right apparently if you want to register a high score for Galaga You can only do it on an unaltered 1981 Japanese Galaga machine.

148
00:08:53,135 --> 00:08:57,408
Scott: with this you can't like if you use like you know the new Galaga pack miss pac-man combo machine.

149
00:08:57,649 --> 00:08:57,950
Scott: that don't.

150
00:08:58,931 --> 00:09:00,436
Rym: Why is there that different?

151
00:09:00,577 --> 00:09:01,440
Scott: that's what they said.

152
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,095
Scott: you have to play it on the original Japanese 1981 Galaga tournament machine.

153
00:09:06,116 --> 00:09:06,918
Scott: that's the only machine.

154
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,041
Scott: you get the high score this.

155
00:09:08,142 --> 00:09:10,810
Rym: so this raises some very important questions.

156
00:09:11,435 --> 00:09:12,625
Rym: For example it raises the.

157
00:09:12,645 --> 00:09:16,563
Scott: I've never played I've never even I saw a picture of that machine online today, and I'm like.

158
00:09:16,603 --> 00:09:18,210
Scott: I've never seen a Galaga like that before.

159
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,757
Scott: That's the original Galaga.

160
00:09:19,798 --> 00:09:20,420
Rym: Here's the problem.

161
00:09:20,441 --> 00:09:29,672
Rym: this raises the ship of Theseus question How what percentage of the components can I have replaced over the years as they broke to have it still count as an original Machine?

162
00:09:29,934 --> 00:09:31,140
Scott: I think it just has to be.

163
00:09:31,482 --> 00:09:33,090
Scott: you know the the exact same.

164
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:43,634
Scott: You know I'm sure if you like Manufactured the exact same thing with the exact same code with the exact same parts even if it wasn't all original parts You know they would be okay.

165
00:09:43,654 --> 00:09:48,410
Rym: that might be unfair though because you have an advantage of all new workings all new perfect controller.

166
00:09:48,894 --> 00:09:50,930
Scott: But I mean you know they just have to be the same exact.

167
00:09:51,111 --> 00:09:55,327
Scott: It would be the same as if you had scored the high score in 1981, and what's the difference.

168
00:09:55,608 --> 00:09:56,190
Scott: that's legitimate?

169
00:09:56,651 --> 00:09:58,338
Scott: You know when all the parts of the machines were brand.

170
00:09:58,358 --> 00:10:04,950
Rym: but at the same time that limits the scope of people have access to The best technology and it over time it'll be harder and harder to get these machines.

171
00:10:05,424 --> 00:10:06,460
Scott: Yeah You know it is.

172
00:10:06,784 --> 00:10:07,350
Scott: it is a question.

173
00:10:07,531 --> 00:10:11,310
Scott: I thought it was interesting and the question is are some of the questions that I was also raised?

174
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:14,002
Scott: I'm also very supposed to score a high scoring Galaga.

175
00:10:14,022 --> 00:10:15,770
Scott: I've never even fucking seen that machine.

176
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:17,296
Scott: I'm also only ever seen normal.

177
00:10:17,397 --> 00:10:25,390
Rym: I'm also curious as to why I mean it sounds like this is just I'm gonna go straight up petty fanboy rules, and I think partially.

178
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:39,659
Scott: But also I do know for a fact that some other Galaga machines especially newer ones have various like difficulty setting switches And there's like some Galaga's let you shoot two bullets at a time and some let you shoot like infinity bullets as fast as you Can push the button and some let you know.

179
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:43,575
Scott: so there's many different settings plus Hardware.

180
00:10:43,636 --> 00:10:45,249
Rym: hack my original machine.

181
00:10:45,571 --> 00:10:49,369
Scott: They would then you wouldn't be valid because they yet to when you see if you send in your videotape.

182
00:10:49,711 --> 00:10:54,970
Scott: Yet to video the like the whole machine so they can see it and inspect it And then they know what it's supposed to be all right.

183
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:58,576
Scott: And if you have a referee the referee inspects the machine And they know what the fuck's going on.

184
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,405
Rym: so if I don't have a referee when does the video start?

185
00:11:00,445 --> 00:11:01,330
Rym: when I start playing it?

186
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,876
Rym: Shows me and the machine and my screen.

187
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:03,238
Scott: you have to.

188
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:10,710
Scott: if you if they're not satisfied with your videotape They just reject it and don't count your score, so it's completely up to twin galaxies whether your video counts or not.

189
00:11:11,002 --> 00:11:12,014
Rym: Yeah so I'm curious.

190
00:11:12,175 --> 00:11:20,310
Rym: I I think it would be fairly easy to hack the machine with a couple of Subtle bits here and there that wouldn't be noticed by someone watching or eight-hour video you are.

191
00:11:20,451 --> 00:11:29,377
Scott: But I mean if they're they're they're real experts And they're examining every detail like if they notice like your ship like skip to the left ones You know which you know or something like that to be like.

192
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:32,306
Scott: hey he died and then re-edited the video.

193
00:11:32,326 --> 00:11:33,550
Scott: That's bullshit and fail.

194
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:45,378
Rym: while that is true I Very much doubt the competence of humans to detect very subtle changes in a long and tedious Video of someone playing an arcade game.

195
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:48,831
Scott: I agree, but they they they're the experts on it I don't.

196
00:11:49,091 --> 00:11:55,751
Scott: I'd be very interested to hear what their actual method for you know verifying videos submissions is but you know I don't know.

197
00:11:55,772 --> 00:11:56,033
Rym: I'm just.

198
00:11:56,093 --> 00:12:00,511
Rym: I'm less and less impressed with these sort of things as time goes on especially after having watched the King of Kong.

199
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,058
Scott: yeah, I didn't watch the King of Kong.

200
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,123
Rym: Yeah, I wouldn't.

201
00:12:03,143 --> 00:12:04,087
Rym: it wasn't that good.

202
00:12:04,107 --> 00:12:06,921
Scott: I'll be honest I thought it was just about like some jerks playing Donkey Kong.

203
00:12:07,122 --> 00:12:07,926
Rym: it basically was.

204
00:12:08,086 --> 00:12:09,431
Rym: it was kind of tedious And it just.

205
00:12:09,832 --> 00:12:10,112
Rym: I don't know.

206
00:12:10,133 --> 00:12:25,379
Rym: the games like this where the difficulty does not necessarily Grow beyond a certain point But at the same like a good example is WarioWare the difficulty keeps going up until it's effectively impossible So that it's going to eliminate people fairly quickly.

207
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,887
Rym: these old-school arcade games if you're the expert at it.

208
00:12:27,927 --> 00:12:28,770
Rym: You're the world champion.

209
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:30,998
Rym: It's just a test of endurance.

210
00:12:31,339 --> 00:12:34,650
Scott: Yeah, that's pretty much what it is especially these sorts of high score games.

211
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:35,380
Scott: It's endurance.

212
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:42,070
Scott: a game like Pitfall though is I think is the much more interesting game for the high score because it's not about right.

213
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:54,969
Scott: There's a bunch of guys out there who can get perfect scores on Atari Pitfall on the 2600 But they're basically racing for the best possible time, and it's like some guys go left some guys go right some guys get.

214
00:12:55,069 --> 00:12:56,158
Scott: you know It's it's totally.

215
00:12:56,319 --> 00:12:56,521
Scott: you know.

216
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:58,734
Scott: they mix it up all the time And it's like you know.

217
00:12:58,834 --> 00:13:00,560
Scott: there's actual competition there.

218
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,490
Rym: well to a degree that remember that is still just a memorization game.

219
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:04,792
Scott: Endurance.

220
00:13:04,912 --> 00:13:05,354
Scott: it's perfect.

221
00:13:05,374 --> 00:13:06,337
Scott: It's about perfection.

222
00:13:06,377 --> 00:13:06,839
Rym: It is well.

223
00:13:06,859 --> 00:13:10,150
Rym: It's a performance art kind of like those Mario 1 racing guys exactly.

224
00:13:10,517 --> 00:13:15,062
Scott: Oh my god High score is a lot better than the you know say the pac-man's.

225
00:13:15,102 --> 00:13:16,327
Rym: what about doggy car?

226
00:13:16,347 --> 00:13:17,070
Rym: what about super pitfall?

227
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:21,810
Scott: Super pitfall just sucks All right, what's your news there?

228
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:33,350
Scott: So you a punk kid who wants to make games and you're probably in college or don't otherwise have a job Don't do what I did and spend your college doing nothing and then regret later not making something while you're in college.

229
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,904
Rym: You mustn't kill time boys.

230
00:13:34,944 --> 00:13:35,650
Rym: He was cherished.

231
00:13:36,045 --> 00:13:36,694
Scott: Yeah Be like.

232
00:13:36,754 --> 00:13:43,750
Scott: you know all those other guys who made some awesome Software while they were in college and then didn't have to get jobs when they got out because their software was their job.

233
00:13:44,572 --> 00:13:49,547
Rym: It's it feels almost very old to be saying this but looking back at college.

234
00:13:49,567 --> 00:13:55,205
Rym: I wasted 99% of the time I had in college.

235
00:13:55,245 --> 00:13:58,657
Rym: now at the same time It's tricky because I enjoyed that wasting.

236
00:13:58,697 --> 00:14:06,139
Rym: and could I have been the person I am today had I not wasted all that time Playing counter-strike and taking around.

237
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:12,890
Scott: the thing is I would have be happier now if I had done something differently But I would not have been happier then if I had done something differently.

238
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,759
Scott: So it's just you know, it's it evens out.

239
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:20,973
Rym: Yes, because remember had we done something in college We would not have had quote those days Exactly.

240
00:14:21,033 --> 00:14:35,930
Rym: So kids either do something or cherish those days and by those days I mean days where you're in college in your little dorm or apartment and You don't have any homework to do and you don't have any classes to go to and you don't have a job yet And you have like three days of nothing.

241
00:14:36,613 --> 00:14:40,469
Rym: Those are the best days you will ever have and the weather's nice and the weather's not.

242
00:14:45,475 --> 00:14:53,627
Scott: Or college guys if you're a girl Or if you're you know, if you swing that way, you know, whatever doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.

243
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:54,530
Scott: Let's continue.

244
00:14:54,932 --> 00:14:59,593
Rym: So if you don't want to have those days and you want to do something You can win.

245
00:14:59,694 --> 00:15:06,175
Rym: actually the company Emily and Alex work for muse games is doing a $10,000 contest and all you have to do a lot of monies.

246
00:15:06,377 --> 00:15:14,628
Rym: all you have to do is make a Prototype of the game you want to make with the unity engine which is this 3d browser based platform.

247
00:15:14,648 --> 00:15:16,854
Rym: That's actually Surprisingly slick.

248
00:15:17,155 --> 00:15:20,050
Scott: So you how do you how do you enter this contest?

249
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,297
Rym: Well, we're gonna link to it.

250
00:15:21,317 --> 00:15:23,090
Rym: basically check out this link and you'll see all the rules.

251
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:29,088
Rym: But you have to make a very simple prototype of your game and tell them you know This is what I want the game to be.

252
00:15:29,491 --> 00:15:36,310
Rym: Here's the working super simple basic prototype and they're gonna go through all these rounds and everything and eventually they're gonna pick a winner.

253
00:15:36,812 --> 00:15:42,613
Rym: The winner gets 10 grand and help from them to make the game and then they'll help you publish it straight up Mm-hmm.

254
00:15:43,116 --> 00:15:49,190
Rym: So if you're in college and you want to make games This is pretty much what you should be doing 10 grand in college.

255
00:15:49,511 --> 00:15:50,817
Rym: That would have changed my entire life.

256
00:15:50,978 --> 00:15:53,650
Scott: and you know what if you make a game and it doesn't win?

257
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:57,670
Scott: I know that the unity engine allows you to make iPhone things.

258
00:15:58,092 --> 00:16:04,081
Scott: So if you're gave you spend time making a game and it doesn't win Turn it into an iPhone game and you'll make some bank.

259
00:16:04,141 --> 00:16:04,744
Scott: I guarantee it.

260
00:16:04,885 --> 00:16:05,950
Rym: now remember I mean think about this.

261
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:06,634
Rym: What do we always see?

262
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:08,970
Rym: you're not wasting your time, especially on the Monday shows?

263
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,783
Rym: You can't learn something by trying to learn it.

264
00:16:11,803 --> 00:16:13,330
Rym: You can only learn something by doing it.

265
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:17,086
Rym: So if you think you want to be a game programmer, you're thinking I should learn game programming.

266
00:16:17,527 --> 00:16:18,070
Rym: No, just do it.

267
00:16:18,191 --> 00:16:19,164
Rym: Just enter this contest.

268
00:16:19,205 --> 00:16:24,025
Scott: exactly Like if you want to learn how to like use a table saw You can't be like I want to learn how to use a table saw.

269
00:16:24,065 --> 00:16:24,790
Scott: just get some wood.

270
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:36,121
Scott: Yeah, you have to be like I want to make a birdhouse or I want to make a cabinet and then in the course of Making cabinet you're gonna need that table saw and once you need the table saw You're gonna use it and learn how to use it.

271
00:16:36,181 --> 00:16:42,550
Rym: aside if you're using a bandsaw Don't think that you can sand wood with the flat side of the blade.

272
00:16:43,186 --> 00:16:43,712
Scott: Yeah That'll.

273
00:16:43,912 --> 00:16:48,290
Rym: I'm gonna point that out because I've seen people do this and I've seen fingers get cut the fuck off.

274
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,455
Scott: Always use proper safety.

275
00:16:51,716 --> 00:16:58,201
Rym: when in a wood or metal shop any sort of workshop scenario also a game shop I did not actually see the finger get cut off.

276
00:16:58,241 --> 00:16:58,966
Scott: make and remember.

277
00:16:59,046 --> 00:17:01,976
Rym: I heard ah And it's funny and there was a finger cut.

278
00:17:01,996 --> 00:17:04,285
Scott: funny as it is in that kind of situation.

279
00:17:04,325 --> 00:17:05,790
Scott: The goggles do not do nothing.

280
00:17:07,135 --> 00:17:11,253
Scott: You need the goggles Okay, but you can.

281
00:17:11,273 --> 00:17:14,586
Scott: they will stop the flying splinter of wood from stabbing you in the eye.

282
00:17:14,626 --> 00:17:18,036
Rym: submissions go until October 15.

283
00:17:18,036 --> 00:17:18,839
Scott: that's a lot of time.

284
00:17:18,901 --> 00:17:19,665
Rym: Yeah, it's only.

285
00:17:19,685 --> 00:17:20,510
Scott: it's a beginning of September.

286
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:29,225
Scott: That's like a whole month Man, if you got a whole month and you're a college kid and all you need to do is make a prototype of a game You know I think back to college you crank that shit out.

287
00:17:29,285 --> 00:17:32,422
Scott: a month was Especially with like an easy engine that helps you out.

288
00:17:32,763 --> 00:17:38,607
Rym: a month was effectively forever Like I think back and the time between like April and May was infinity time.

289
00:17:38,647 --> 00:17:39,651
Rym: That was the entire life I.

290
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:40,779
Scott: now months are like yet.

291
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,484
Scott: Just another rent.

292
00:17:41,504 --> 00:17:44,296
Scott: check out the door My god all the time, but they'll announce.

293
00:17:44,336 --> 00:17:49,351
Rym: the winners are the winner at the unite unity conference in San Francisco at the end of October.

294
00:17:49,552 --> 00:17:51,999
Scott: ooh, they're gonna go to San Francisco our friends.

295
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:52,621
Rym: I think so.

296
00:17:52,802 --> 00:17:54,186
Scott: Oh shits quote.

297
00:17:54,286 --> 00:17:57,820
Rym: as indie developers ourselves We strongly believe that the Indian in the Indian community.

298
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,890
Rym: We want to reward developers for making great games.

299
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:05,670
Rym: Hopefully we're gonna make this a model of successful one for the future and ultimately raise the stakes on browser-based indie development.

300
00:18:06,012 --> 00:18:06,313
Rym: All right.

301
00:18:06,474 --> 00:18:07,057
Rym: We'll have a link.

302
00:18:07,137 --> 00:18:07,580
Rym: check it out.

303
00:18:07,801 --> 00:18:08,605

00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:12,127
Scott: I Contest be like ten grand Rupel's.

305
00:18:19,781 --> 00:18:21,165
Rym: So anyway things of the day.

306
00:18:21,506 --> 00:18:22,448
Rym: I thought this was cute.

307
00:18:22,749 --> 00:18:23,451
Rym: I just straight-up.

308
00:18:23,672 --> 00:18:24,795
Rym: there's nothing else I can say.

309
00:18:25,216 --> 00:18:28,898
Rym: this is a Venn diagram of mystical beasts.

310
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:35,232
Rym: So it's not like these human Eagle horse Narwhal dog and bull.

311
00:18:35,713 --> 00:18:39,910
Rym: and every intersection of all these circles is One or other various mythical beasts.

312
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:48,239
Rym: for example horse and narwhal Unicorn yeah snake and eagle cockatrice lion and man trees cockatrice magic.

313
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,419
Scott: are I like a manticore bull and mermaid?

314
00:18:53,782 --> 00:18:56,960
Scott: What's a bull in a room it gets up there, but I like a hippo canvas.

315
00:18:57,201 --> 00:19:01,636
Rym: I think my favorite part is there's dog dog and dog and in the middle of these three is Cerberus.

316
00:19:01,917 --> 00:19:02,680
Scott: Yeah, it's about right.

317
00:19:03,562 --> 00:19:04,629
Rym: This thing's just cute and funny.

318
00:19:04,689 --> 00:19:05,253
Rym: I don't know what's like.

319
00:19:05,313 --> 00:19:06,259
Scott: is there human and goat?

320
00:19:06,982 --> 00:19:11,360
Rym: They didn't add goat because if they had added goat along with lion they could have gotten like Samara.

321
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:16,580
Scott: They could have had Seder and chimera, and yeah, they didn't have any of that, but those are magical beasts.

322
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,784
Scott: What the fuck they've got.

323
00:19:17,844 --> 00:19:21,076
Rym: centaur Pegasus unicorn echidna harpy manticore sound.

324
00:19:21,156 --> 00:19:22,340
Scott: I don't know what's up with this echidna.

325
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,911
Scott: I thought echidna was like knuckles from Sonic the head clearly knuckles.

326
00:19:25,951 --> 00:19:27,776
Scott: the echidna know anything about Greek myth.

327
00:19:28,237 --> 00:19:29,100
Scott: It should be a Lamia.

328
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:35,289
Rym: Lamia is a type of monster Action is a specific monster.

329
00:19:35,309 --> 00:19:40,451
Rym: Scott is very into hot Lamia action as I discovered during final Action is a huge inside joke.

330
00:19:40,732 --> 00:19:42,400
Rym: There's the thing about hot Lamia action.

331
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:47,315
Rym: It is difficult to deny the hotness of that Lamia as we all could agree.

332
00:19:47,355 --> 00:19:49,000
Scott: actually that Lamia was not that hot.

333
00:19:49,443 --> 00:19:51,898
Rym: I don't know it for it was actually sort of a bitch Lamia.

334
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:59,540
Rym: well It's really big do she wasn't that much of a bitch considering that we murdered all of her chefs and then her husband.

335
00:20:00,263 --> 00:20:03,737
Scott: We murdered her before we murdered her as we murdered them both at about the same time.

336
00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:06,948
Rym: in fact We tried to murder him first until she started healing him.

337
00:20:06,968 --> 00:20:10,579
Rym: we had to back up and kill her, but yeah, that's anyway poor mr.

338
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,747
Scott: Mashant for Lamia's.

339
00:20:12,907 --> 00:20:14,654
Scott: okay, so what do you got for me?

340
00:20:15,136 --> 00:20:20,209
Scott: Oh right thing of the day, so The the old Lucasarts adventure games are getting popular again.

Scott: There's a lot of people out there who are just making adventure games on these engines scum VM or whatever right and You know in the style of monkey island or Indiana Jones and Atlantis or whatever.

343
00:20:39,594 --> 00:20:41,500
Scott: they're making adventure games in these styles.

344
00:20:42,045 --> 00:20:45,566
Rym: That are not actually I know what you're talking about.

345
00:20:45,687 --> 00:20:46,629
Rym: I want to play this.

346
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:50,200
Scott: so there is out there someone made another Indiana Jones adventure game.

347
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,685
Scott: That's just another Indiana Jones adventure game But that's not what you're talking about.

348
00:20:53,926 --> 00:20:59,046
Scott: somebody else so is in the process of making Han Solo adventures.

349
00:20:59,066 --> 00:21:00,390
Rym: I watch the video.

350
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:03,600
Rym: that was basically the the guy clicked on shoot first.

351
00:21:04,182 --> 00:21:04,464
Rym: It was.

352
00:21:04,725 --> 00:21:06,111
Rym: it was just so.

353
00:21:06,171 --> 00:21:08,020
Scott: check out this video is the thing of the day.

354
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,319
Scott: but eventually this game will be released and playable supposedly.

00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:13,399
Scott: and Yeah, you check it out.

356
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:24,820
Rym: If you're an adventure game type person so if you are going or Star Wars type person if you're going to go to PAX Which hopefully you are then you should do certain things at PAX like go to our panels.

357
00:21:25,101 --> 00:21:31,958
Scott: That's right, so if you're not going to PAX, and you don't have a badge already your SOL Just stay home.

358
00:21:32,742 --> 00:21:40,383
Rym: So on Friday in the Raven Theatre at 1130 in the morning We're doing beyond Candyland.

359
00:21:40,443 --> 00:21:43,331
Rym: that is the OMG German board games are the shit.

360
00:21:43,351 --> 00:21:46,178
Rym: you should play them panel yep on Saturday morning.

361
00:21:46,218 --> 00:21:52,838
Rym: We're doing on Saturday at 1030 a.m.. In the Wolfman theater.

362
00:21:52,859 --> 00:21:57,851
Rym: oh I wondered if you were going to make a sound effect or not We are going to be doing.

363
00:21:57,911 --> 00:21:59,060
Rym: losing should be fun.

364
00:21:59,181 --> 00:22:02,060
Rym: Which is the panel about how losing should be fun.

365
00:22:02,723 --> 00:22:04,791
Scott: Also, I just want to point out that packs.

366
00:22:04,951 --> 00:22:07,120
Scott: I don't think they like looked at their whole panel list.

367
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,126
Rym: We already talked about this.

368
00:22:08,589 --> 00:22:09,253
Scott: I'll talk about it again.

369
00:22:09,273 --> 00:22:09,776
Scott: Just quickly.

370
00:22:09,856 --> 00:22:20,019
Scott: on Friday I think night someone's doing a panel winning sucks Which is basically someone who seems to at least by judging by the panel description completely agree with us.

371
00:22:20,601 --> 00:22:24,674
Scott: So they have basically two redundant panels, and I want to go to that other guy's panel.

372
00:22:24,714 --> 00:22:28,679
Scott: so we can you know heckle Yeah, you know make nice.

373
00:22:29,401 --> 00:22:30,165
Rym: Hopefully we agree.

374
00:22:30,185 --> 00:22:37,640
Scott: I mean maybe you know I'm pretty sure he's like winning sucks And he's like losing sucks even worse, and we're like losing should be fun and winning should be even more fun.

375
00:22:39,264 --> 00:22:40,249
Scott: No, but I think he agrees.

376
00:22:40,289 --> 00:22:42,400
Scott: it's someone who agrees with us, and they have the same panel twice.

377
00:22:42,781 --> 00:22:45,390
Rym: Oh, well, so I don't think it's a popular idea.

378
00:22:45,591 --> 00:22:49,748
Rym: I don't think it's the same panel twice necessarily because remember It's not like they're trying to get like.

379
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,920
Rym: we need a panel on this and a panel on this.

380
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:55,937
Scott: No, no, but I mean they didn't notice that two panels had basically the same exact.

381
00:22:56,077 --> 00:22:56,700
Scott: I don't area.

382
00:22:56,861 --> 00:23:01,100
Rym: I don't think it's a matter of not noticing at all because talking to them They seem to have vetted the panels out very well.

383
00:23:01,161 --> 00:23:05,940
Rym: I think it's that They picked people who they think have interesting things to say and just put them in rooms.

384
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:06,985
Rym: And I think that's it.

385
00:23:07,226 --> 00:23:08,090
Scott: and we have the.

386
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,019
Scott: we happen to have the same thing to say someone else.

387
00:23:10,403 --> 00:23:12,000
Rym: I don't think that's that far out there.

388
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,499
Rym: I mean look Luke Crane and Jared Sorenson also have this thing to say and if they were more together They would probably have done a panel like this.

389
00:23:18,381 --> 00:23:33,954
Scott: And on Sunday morning if you didn't notice all our panels are basically morning panels one panel Friday morning one panel Saturday morning one panel Sunday morning at 10 a.m We are doing yet again a reprise at PAX Beyond Dungeons & Dragons last time ever at PAX West.

390
00:23:34,015 --> 00:23:36,828
Rym: most likely however We are going to be doing it at PAX East.

391
00:23:36,888 --> 00:23:39,320
Rym: we're going to be doing it possibly at the New York Comic Con.

392
00:23:39,883 --> 00:23:46,067
Rym: This panel will never die because people it's gonna die by 2011. see maybe what.

393
00:23:46,087 --> 00:23:48,115
Rym: what if PAX just keeps wanting us to do it every year?

394
00:23:48,216 --> 00:23:48,698
Scott: Well.

395
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:50,144
Scott: I'll say no We're doing something different.

396
00:23:50,164 --> 00:23:50,546
Rym: I'll do it.

397
00:23:50,646 --> 00:23:51,651
Scott: Let's come up with something different.

398
00:23:51,732 --> 00:23:53,158
Rym: Yeah, I'll do something different and I'll do it.

399
00:23:54,222 --> 00:23:55,305
Scott: No, we should replace it.

400
00:23:55,445 --> 00:24:03,009
Rym: why if new people keep wanting to see it until we have a definitive films at least remix it With what it's perfect.

401
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:03,291
Scott: No.

402
00:24:03,351 --> 00:24:04,477
Scott: It's we could do sudden.

403
00:24:04,537 --> 00:24:07,415
Scott: That's you know Crook slightly, so why?

404
00:24:07,476 --> 00:24:07,880
Rym: why bother?

405
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:14,580
Rym: Megato Megatie until we just film it and put the definitive version online we might have to keep doing it.

406
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:23,610
Rym: But Sunday 10 a.m.. In the Raven theater Beyond Dungeons & Dragons Yes beyond that don't come to see that.

407
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,040

00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:44,299

00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:10,699
Rym: I don't know how this is gonna work.

452
00:26:10,739 --> 00:26:12,779
Scott: well We'll check it out at con.

453
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,767
Rym: We'll check out the details.

454
00:26:13,807 --> 00:26:18,696
Rym: if it is not too much of a hassle I might just enter that because I think I can win.

455
00:26:18,716 --> 00:26:19,440
Rym: I can win.

456
00:26:19,721 --> 00:26:21,567
Rym: I think I'm a pretty optimal.

457
00:26:21,607 --> 00:26:27,338
Scott: maybe maybe we'll play against each other in the first round and then one of us will just be Out and it'll be real easy.

458
00:26:28,266 --> 00:26:35,037
Rym: You know maybe it'll be a round-robin situation I might have to brush up because I don't remember the exact method to get the factory going well.

459
00:26:35,097 --> 00:26:37,077
Scott: Let's play when.

460
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:46,356
Scott: Okay, so yeah if you're going to PAX do all those things also the game works outside of.

461
00:26:46,397 --> 00:26:48,900
Scott: PAX is a good place to Play some games and PAX is closed.

462
00:26:49,021 --> 00:26:53,098
Rym: I was thinking about renting the whole place out and having a party, but then I don't have the.

463
00:26:53,499 --> 00:26:55,791
Rym: yeah I just couldn't deal with that this year.

464
00:26:55,871 --> 00:26:56,655
Rym: Yeah, I called them.

465
00:26:56,736 --> 00:26:57,500
Rym: I had it all set up.

466
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,369
Rym: I just had to like give them money, and I just didn't.

467
00:26:59,831 --> 00:27:03,190
Scott: so last year at PAX We ate at a bunch of different restaurants.

468
00:27:03,411 --> 00:27:04,820
Scott: Von's was the best restaurant.

469
00:27:05,705 --> 00:27:07,456
Rym: No, this is a terrible restaurant.

470
00:27:07,496 --> 00:27:11,566
Scott: You shouldn't eat that If you've never been to Seattle before.

471
00:27:11,586 --> 00:27:14,576
Scott: the sci-fi museum is worth like an hour of your time.

472
00:27:14,617 --> 00:27:16,587
Rym: the Space Needle is mini But it's worth seeing.

473
00:27:16,627 --> 00:27:17,554
Rym: just don't ride the monorail.

474
00:27:17,574 --> 00:27:18,239
Rym: It's not worth it.

475
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:23,119
Scott: But actually I found out there's a monorail that goes from the airport to the the city.

476
00:27:23,199 --> 00:27:27,380
Scott: yes But it was not built yet, but now it is built so we can use it to get to the city.

477
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:28,346
Scott: Is it built yeah?

478
00:27:28,648 --> 00:27:30,279
Rym: Oh cuz I went as we could use it.

479
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:33,513
Rym: I went to a website and it didn't say it worked yet, and I'm pretty sure.

480
00:27:33,653 --> 00:27:36,024
Scott: well if we if it's not working if we get There it's not working.

481
00:27:36,105 --> 00:27:42,994
Scott: We'll take a car so it's not a big deal, but yeah There's a. we use the monorail to get from the airport to Seattle on a rail.

482
00:27:43,175 --> 00:27:47,678
Scott: I didn't check to see if there's any Football or baseball game, so I don't know about that.

483
00:27:48,442 --> 00:27:51,517
Rym: However, do not ride the monorail in Seattle it goes.

484
00:27:51,537 --> 00:27:52,080
Scott: Oh, it's lame.

485
00:27:52,201 --> 00:27:54,430
Rym: I'll tell you this it goes about 15 feet.

486
00:27:54,731 --> 00:27:56,720
Scott: do try to find the secret donut place.

487
00:27:56,983 --> 00:27:58,016
Rym: I'm not gonna tell you where it is.

488
00:27:58,077 --> 00:28:02,931
Rym: however It is between The ma isn't in a tree in between packs and the Space Needle.

489
00:28:02,971 --> 00:28:06,603
Rym: it is somewhere in a triangle between the two monorail stops And packs.

490
00:28:06,924 --> 00:28:09,514
Scott: there is also this music festival.

491
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:12,863
Scott: You know Woodstock style Yeah, the bumper chute.

492
00:28:12,883 --> 00:28:18,560
Scott: That's going all weekend including Monday and Pat Monday is Labor Day and packs is not going on Monday.

493
00:28:18,843 --> 00:28:20,640
Scott: This is Friday Saturday Sunday.

494
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:28,860
Scott: So you could go to the bumper chute Monday if you're still in Seattle you know and if you are Loser none of a packs badge you can just go to the bumper chute all weekend.

495
00:28:28,983 --> 00:28:33,880
Rym: I think next year I'm just gonna take like Tuesday off or Wednesday off and stay in Seattle longer and go to the bumper chute.

496
00:28:34,021 --> 00:28:36,072
Scott: Yeah, I mean we walked around it last year.

497
00:28:36,092 --> 00:28:36,716
Scott: We didn't go into it.

498
00:28:36,877 --> 00:28:47,000
Rym: also guys Just let us know because you know I really seriously considered just renting out game works for like Sunday night after packs Because last year it was like some girls about Mitzvah.

499
00:28:47,662 --> 00:28:57,416
Rym: So if you guys will attend and you guys want me to do that just email us and for next facts I'll just do it because it wasn't that much money like I could have just paid for it.

500
00:28:57,436 --> 00:29:01,415
Scott: Mm-hmm In the exhibition hall.

501
00:29:01,455 --> 00:29:02,602
Scott: there are two things You know.

502
00:29:02,783 --> 00:29:05,557
Scott: of course there's gonna be a million awesome things in there for you to check out.

503
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,200
Rym: unknown worlds.

504
00:29:06,522 --> 00:29:09,700
Scott: Yes, the two things that you should check out just go and give them money.

505
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,145
Rym: Don't even just throw it at them.

506
00:29:11,225 --> 00:29:17,866
Scott: unknown worlds creators of natural selection will be there with natural selection to Most likely almost definitely.

507
00:29:18,348 --> 00:29:24,126
Scott: just go there and just give them your wallet and take you know whatever they're giving out Unknown worlds.

508
00:29:24,428 --> 00:29:32,000
Scott: and number two in the exhibition hall Our friend Eric Marshak the guy who does all of the chalks at the conventions.

509
00:29:33,082 --> 00:29:34,989
Scott: He didn't say what chalk he's doing.

510
00:29:35,009 --> 00:29:37,840
Scott: He's being paid by a company to do a chalk a spot He's.

511
00:29:37,881 --> 00:29:42,320
Scott: so it's a paid advertising chalks at PAX, and he didn't say what it was.

512
00:29:42,421 --> 00:29:49,720
Scott: He has an NDA but on his website He posted a section of an image that included a pointy drill.

513
00:29:50,183 --> 00:29:54,445
Scott: So I would wager it is either a Gurren Lagann not likely.

514
00:29:54,465 --> 00:29:57,212
Scott: it's probably a Bioshock to chalk.

515
00:29:57,252 --> 00:29:58,074
Scott: that is my guess.

516
00:29:58,414 --> 00:29:59,657
Scott: I guess only so.

517
00:29:59,878 --> 00:30:02,587
Scott: don't sue him Whoever makes Bioshock.

518
00:30:02,607 --> 00:30:05,557
Scott:  so yeah, but there's gonna be awesome chalk going on.

519
00:30:05,638 --> 00:30:06,220
Scott: say hi to him.

520
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:12,404
Scott: he likes to be interrupted and so he has you know time to stand up and stretch and Such man.

521
00:30:12,464 --> 00:30:14,892
Rym: I didn't look at like anything that's going on.

522
00:30:14,933 --> 00:30:18,872
Rym: in terms of the like omega-thon Yeah, it's an omega-thon.

523
00:30:18,972 --> 00:30:20,140
Scott: You'll watch the final round.

524
00:30:20,321 --> 00:30:22,571
Rym: I found that the best way to deal with the omega-thon

525
00:30:22,652 --> 00:30:24,661
Scott: is to do music videos at an anime convention If you

526
00:30:24,761 --> 00:30:30,238
Rym: happen to wander into an area where a contest is going on watch it because it's usually great

527
00:30:30,298 --> 00:30:30,860
Scott: most definitely

528
00:30:31,102 --> 00:30:39,347
Rym: But it's really doesn't seem to be worth it to stand in line to wait And you'll see the end at the end, and I don't know if they're gonna be able to top What they did last year.

529
00:30:39,447 --> 00:30:47,576
Scott: Excitebike - yep also at PAX our Amazing listener row she has printed up There's this PAX button near thing that goes on.

530

Scott: So she printed out all these packs GeekNights buttons.

534
00:30:56,762 --> 00:31:03,899
Scott: So if you are at PAX and you're a GeekNights listener You should definitely make sure you get one of those buttons.

00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:23,659
Scott: All right.

602
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:28,915
Scott: So anyway, if you're not at packs, what other games should you be playing?

603
00:34:29,054 --> 00:34:30,800
Rym: should you really be playing games?

604
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,992
Rym: Because clearly you did not want packs enough.

605
00:34:34,313 --> 00:34:36,139
Scott: Well, I mean, it's Labor Day weekend.

606
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:39,089
Scott: So the first game you should play is barbecue.

607
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:44,039
Scott: Otherwise Will Smith's gonna say I could have been at a barbecue I could have been at packs.

608
00:34:44,321 --> 00:34:47,248
Scott: Drag your ass to the burden desert.

609
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:48,150
Scott: who's a man?

610
00:34:48,652 --> 00:34:50,438
Scott: So be sure to barbecue.

611
00:34:50,498 --> 00:34:58,836
Scott: if you're not a pack Weekend go out in the United States and it's not Labor Day where you are Barbecue anyway, it's still Saturday and Sunday.

612
00:34:58,916 --> 00:35:00,906
Rym: You could barbecue You know what as I've learned.

613
00:35:01,127 --> 00:35:09,297
Scott: and if you're in the southern hemisphere where it's cold Barbecue anyway, if you ever have a design in your house to barbecue just do it.

614
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:09,960
Scott: just do it.

615
00:35:10,101 --> 00:35:12,560
Scott: Don't ever hesitate its barbecue weekend around the world.

616
00:35:12,881 --> 00:35:14,907
Rym: But anyway, you know you should be doing.

617
00:35:14,928 --> 00:35:18,619
Rym: if you're not a packs watch some TED Talks and enter this game contest.

618
00:35:19,202 --> 00:35:20,727
Rym: And I don't know edify yourself.

619
00:35:20,828 --> 00:35:24,140
Scott: well one game you should play is a free game.

620
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:31,659
Scott: This Warsaw is basically is basically this open-source FPS But it got really polished and it's a lot like quake.

621
00:35:32,181 --> 00:35:46,499
Scott: Only you have this special movement button that makes it really basically it's like quake but bunny hopping is really easy Jumping off of walls is really easy And it's slick and polished and open-source and free for Mac Linux Windows and you can just get it.

622
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,804
Scott: It's WARS.

623
00:35:47,864 --> 00:35:52,460
Scott: Oh W just search for it on Google and it's not the greatest game in the universe, but you know what?

624
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,543
Scott: It's real fast.

625
00:35:53,603 --> 00:35:54,286
Scott: It's an FPS.

626
00:35:54,346 --> 00:35:55,229
Scott: It's a lot like quake.

627
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:56,493
Scott: It's real colorful.

628
00:35:56,614 --> 00:35:57,256
Scott: It looks good.

629
00:35:57,276 --> 00:35:58,440
Scott: I played it a little bit.

630
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,003
Scott: It's nice.

631
00:35:59,546 --> 00:36:01,376
Scott: Just get it and it's free.

632
00:36:01,416 --> 00:36:01,798
Scott: What the hell?

633
00:36:02,963 --> 00:36:08,900
Scott: Another game you should be playing Because you're not gonna be able to see unknown worlds in the exhibition hall at PAX.

634
00:36:09,462 --> 00:36:12,976
Scott: You're just going to play NS one like a sad sack, but you know NS one.

635
00:36:13,016 --> 00:36:13,860
Scott: I've been playing it lately.

636
00:36:14,483 --> 00:36:15,991
Rym: One is still one of my favorite.

637
00:36:16,031 --> 00:36:20,485
Rym: I pretty much play natural selection Civ for quake live.

638
00:36:20,686 --> 00:36:21,889
Scott: so make this.

639
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:31,095
Scott: if you're not going to PAX make this your weekend to play NS one and if You don't know how to play NS one Make this your weekend to learn how to play NS one in preparation for NS to.

640
00:36:31,175 --> 00:36:32,360
Rym: you want to know how to learn to play?

641
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:32,943
Rym: NS one.

642
00:36:33,425 --> 00:36:37,845
Rym: read the dot read the documentation on the website, which is out of date But still mostly accurate.

643
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:40,456
Rym: and then because that you know back in the day, you know with FPS is I?

644
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:48,340
Rym: Used to like read the website and it would tell me how to play and then I would play and I'd know what to do And people today don't seem to read the website.

645
00:36:48,521 --> 00:36:53,840
Scott: Well, a lot of times the website doesn't have an instruction counter strike, especially for obscure mods.

646
00:36:53,920 --> 00:37:04,187
Rym: They don't have the instructions on the site and as does however But as does just join any NS game that isn't combat join a team and then ask the team in the chat What do I do?

647
00:37:04,287 --> 00:37:06,299
Rym: and someone will tell you to do something and just do it?

648
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,590
Scott: Make sure you join Marines.

649
00:37:07,812 --> 00:37:09,484
Scott: if you join aliens You're probably just gonna.

650
00:37:09,825 --> 00:37:17,820
Scott: you have a lot more potential to hurt your team very badly and also You're just gonna be a lot harder to be aliens because it requires a lot more FPS skills.

651
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:23,099
Rym: Yeah, one bad marine is basically just gonna die alone crying and scared in the dark But he's not gonna bring his team down with it.

652
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:29,017
Scott: Yeah one Die one shitty alien is gonna basically get a whole bunch of res and not use them for shit and then die.

653
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:29,880
Scott: and it's gonna Be.

654
00:37:29,921 --> 00:37:30,523
Scott: it's gonna suck.

655
00:37:30,563 --> 00:37:31,466
Rym: Hey guys, don't worry.

656
00:37:31,988 --> 00:37:34,176

713
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:28,537
Scott: So pay attention to our feeds to get the latest packs goody goodies from the packs.

714
00:40:28,939 --> 00:40:29,440
Rym: Yeah, what else?

715
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:29,862
Rym: You know what?

716
00:40:30,384 --> 00:40:34,420
Rym: if you're you know, you're listening to this cuz you're into some other type of game or you don't play at play.

717
00:40:34,521 --> 00:40:36,456
Rym: FPS is just go on Steam right now.

718
00:40:37,081 --> 00:40:41,593
Rym: Buy half-life 1. put it on easy mode half-life 1 source.

719
00:40:41,654 --> 00:40:42,275
Scott: It's a little bit.

720
00:40:42,295 --> 00:40:43,880
Scott: Yeah, it's a little bit doesn't matter.

721
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:46,169
Rym: Just put it on easy mode and just play it.

722
00:40:46,531 --> 00:40:53,130
Rym: You will realize that FPS is can be fun If you've never played a real FPS multiplayer deathmatch.

723
00:40:53,611 --> 00:40:57,140
Rym: and or you think that team fortress 2 is an awesome game play some quake live.

724
00:40:58,345 --> 00:41:00,935
Scott: Quake live is available now for Linux Mac Windows.

725
00:41:00,995 --> 00:41:09,276
Rym: So if you haven't played it yet Any time you think we're too harsh on modern FPS is or you think that we're you know, we're not.

726
00:41:09,297 --> 00:41:11,364
Rym: just go play quake live You'll see what we mean.

727
00:41:11,765 --> 00:41:17,210
Rym: and here Warsaw if you don't set your FOV to at least 120 You're not hardcore Warsaw.

728
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:18,255
Scott: Let's change the FOV.

729
00:41:18,537 --> 00:41:19,220
Rym: You know, what's bad?

730
00:41:20,182 --> 00:41:24,123
Scott: There's an option in the options menu to just change FOV and worse NS.

731
00:41:24,163 --> 00:41:27,220
Rym: it works because NS is a special kind of game but ricochet.

732
00:41:28,042 --> 00:41:32,240
Rym: I had a lot of trouble playing ricochet because I'm so used to an FOV of 129.

733
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,327
Scott: Yeah, ricochet cannot change the FOV.

734
00:41:34,347 --> 00:41:36,494
Scott: I it's not gonna work.

735
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:40,106
Rym: 129 was necessary and I've gotten to the point You gotta be 90 degrees in ricochet.

736
00:41:40,126 --> 00:41:41,390
Scott: I figure out the angles properly.

737
00:41:41,431 --> 00:41:43,959
Rym: No, no, no, I don't know if I can change it.

738
00:41:44,482 --> 00:41:45,512
Rym: I don't know if I'm allowed to.

739
00:41:45,532 --> 00:41:49,008
Rym: oh But I can't play with a 90 anymore.

740
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:52,520
Scott: I forgot that when I play goes and I'll chop your head off with my you will.

741
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,301
Rym: Chainsaw blade is back in the day Like.

742
00:41:54,341 --> 00:42:00,480
Rym: it took me over a year when I started playing counter-strike to learn to play with a low FOV again.

743
00:42:01,042 --> 00:42:07,212
Rym: Well, because I used to play like with all the dynamic lighting, you know last year's packs We didn't actually go into the the.

744
00:42:07,352 --> 00:42:08,660
Scott: bring your own PC area.

745
00:42:08,761 --> 00:42:11,779
Scott: The thing is we can't bring our PCs obviously because you need to register to do that.

746
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,800
Scott: But half the room was just filled with Dells that were already set up and it was a big room.

747
00:42:16,262 --> 00:42:17,166
Scott: So this year I want to.

748
00:42:17,267 --> 00:42:21,271
Scott: I want to definitely go in that room a little bit more than last year Maybe get some PC game and go.

749
00:42:21,332 --> 00:42:22,420
Rym: I have very fond memories.

750
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:32,800
Rym: I forget what con it was but me and Scott Johnson were doing like the anime programming for some gaming con in Rochester Mm-hmm as we did very often and they had a land gaming area.

751
00:42:33,061 --> 00:42:36,478
Rym: So we wandered over there late at night and kind of drunk and played games.

752
00:42:36,519 --> 00:42:36,700
Scott: tax.

753
00:42:36,941 --> 00:42:45,611
Scott: I wish packs was just overnight because I would go to that land gaming area Friday night after the concerts and I would go to The tabletop gaming area Saturday night after the concerts.

754
00:42:45,651 --> 00:42:46,214
Scott: Well funny.

755
00:42:46,254 --> 00:42:47,640
Scott: You should say that I just wouldn't go to bed.

756
00:42:48,382 --> 00:42:49,389
Rym: Funny you should say that.

757
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:52,704
Rym: let me get back to the packs website Because there was a news.

758
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:54,589
Rym: our item of interest.

759
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:55,271
Rym: blah blah blah.

760
00:42:55,351 --> 00:42:56,615
Rym: Okay from 830.

761
00:42:56,615 --> 00:43:00,085
Rym: I First want to clear up a common question.

762
00:43:00,105 --> 00:43:01,008
Rym: We've been getting this week.

763
00:43:01,309 --> 00:43:01,610
Rym: Yes.

764
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:05,060
Rym: We are sold out three-day Friday and Saturday badges.

765
00:43:05,481 --> 00:43:10,539
Rym: Yes, this includes walk-up purchases given that we will sell out of Sunday badges in the next day or two.

766
00:43:11,081 --> 00:43:12,547
Scott: They're sold out of Sunday badges already.

767
00:43:13,008 --> 00:43:16,120
Rym: If you have not purchased a badge online, you will not get into packs.

768
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:18,089
Rym: Please do not try to buy a badge on site.

769
00:43:18,310 --> 00:43:20,380
Rym: We have no badges to sell again.

770
00:43:20,782 --> 00:43:22,088
Rym: We have no valid badges to sell.

771
00:43:22,108 --> 00:43:22,831
Rym: we apologize.

772
00:43:23,073 --> 00:43:23,173
Rym: Now.

773
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:23,756
Rym: Here's the quote.

774
00:43:23,776 --> 00:43:26,162
Rym: that's interesting Quote.

775
00:43:26,183 --> 00:43:32,161
Rym: we are trying to secure more space for 2010 Mm-hmm.

776
00:43:32,603 --> 00:43:33,907
Rym: I don't know what they're gonna get.

777
00:43:33,967 --> 00:43:35,592
Scott: Well another interesting remember last year.

778
00:43:35,612 --> 00:43:36,916
Scott: The tabletop was in the annex.

779
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:38,080
Scott: this year.

780
00:43:38,181 --> 00:43:40,053
Scott: They got the top floor of the main building.

781
00:43:40,094 --> 00:43:40,879
Scott: They don't have the annex.

782
00:43:41,441 --> 00:43:53,299
Scott: So what happened is they're moving all of the console gaming up top and all the a lot of the panel rooms up top and The tabletop is going down where the console and the panel rooms used to be down low.

783
00:43:54,064 --> 00:43:54,648
Scott: So that's gonna be.

784
00:43:54,829 --> 00:44:00,197
Scott: it's gonna be a lot more like, you know The other kind of tabletop gaming cons we go to where there's like lots of small rooms.

785
00:44:00,257 --> 00:44:05,360
Rym: I think Connecticut I think the tabletop is gonna get a lot more walk-in traffic as a result, which I think will do very well for Luke Crane.

786
00:44:05,481 --> 00:44:10,148
Scott: I think you'll do very well for Luke Crane who is again Saturday in tabletop areas.

787
00:44:10,168 --> 00:44:12,698
Scott: look for Luke Crane to play the burning wheels and such.

788
00:44:13,039 --> 00:44:15,246
Rym: Yes We will tweet his exact location.

789
00:44:15,346 --> 00:44:18,174
Rym: Once we sort all that business follow the tweets in memory.

790
00:44:18,334 --> 00:44:18,956
Scott: There's a it's.

791
00:44:19,076 --> 00:44:26,600
Scott: it's hard to do a Search on Twitter for packs because you'll basically find a bunch of searches about peace not anymore.

792
00:44:26,881 --> 00:44:28,289
Rym: You're basically just gonna find packs.

793
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:32,873
Scott: Well, I searched for pound Pax and that is how you will find the good.

794
00:44:32,893 --> 00:44:33,940
Rym: Well, that's how Twitter works.

795
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,560
Scott: Well, some people just search for you know, just packs on its own.

796
00:44:36,881 --> 00:44:40,474
Rym: I only do that if I'm searching for something obscure like I don't know GeekNights.

797
00:44:40,515 --> 00:44:40,936
Scott: Yeah.

798
00:44:41,097 --> 00:44:41,920
Scott: Yeah, it's all good.

799
00:44:42,542 --> 00:44:44,350
Scott: It's real hard to search for so it's really hard to like.

800
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:44,912
Scott: have I search?

801
00:44:45,053 --> 00:44:46,680
Scott: I do a Twitter search like Python.

802
00:44:47,041 --> 00:44:48,646
Scott: It's like you see all these snakes posts.

803
00:44:49,147 --> 00:44:52,597
Rym: How much can people be posting about herpetology on a regular basis?

804
00:44:52,798 --> 00:45:02,895
Rym: be surprised Anyway, but I wonder what they're gonna do and maybe I think the solution for packs would be to either move out of Seattle But that wouldn't really work.

805
00:45:02,976 --> 00:45:03,964
Scott: now It's not gonna happen.

806
00:45:04,205 --> 00:45:09,511
Rym: PAX East has a better proposition is if they fill up Boston Which they're definitely gonna do in a few years pretty quickly.

807
00:45:10,274 --> 00:45:11,460
Rym: They could just move it to Baltimore.

808
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:14,588
Scott: Yeah, yeah, it's not the best place.

809
00:45:14,669 --> 00:45:16,878
Rym: I think the BCC can handle packs.

810
00:45:16,979 --> 00:45:19,084
Scott: East Building is fine.

811
00:45:19,104 --> 00:45:20,388
Scott: The city is no.

812
00:45:20,448 --> 00:45:22,054
Scott: I think they'd be better off.

813
00:45:22,716 --> 00:45:23,057
Scott: I don't know.

814
00:45:23,077 --> 00:45:23,920
Scott: I don't know.

815
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:25,540
Rym: There aren't enough hotels in Boston.

816
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:38,032
Scott: I don't think in the what I would do if I was packs though if he needed to expand as I basically get a Ballroom in every hotel because you know like one inches that you know CES right the consumer electronics show in Vegas the way it works Right.

817
00:45:38,073 --> 00:45:40,170
Scott: Is this the main floor in the Convention Center?

818
00:45:40,731 --> 00:45:45,270
Scott: But then in all the hotels all like the companies get rooms and stuff.

819
00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:48,492
Scott: So it's like yes come to this hotel to check out I don't know.

820
00:45:48,533 --> 00:45:54,409
Scott: like company X's TV lineup and they'll have like a you know They'll bring all like reporters over there showing their TVs and stuff.

821
00:45:55,192 --> 00:46:07,383
Scott: If Pax is more like that where suddenly you get like companies or people like getting all the ballrooms and all the hotels to basically Effectively expand packs so that like there's a route everyone in your hotel.

822
00:46:07,423 --> 00:46:09,789
Scott: The ballroom has game and go hood on, you know.

823
00:46:10,571 --> 00:46:13,478
Scott: Oh also a Pax badge pickup is at the Hyatt.

824
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:15,122
Scott: It's not at the Convention Center.

825
00:46:15,142 --> 00:46:15,684
Scott: It's at the Hyatt.

826
00:46:15,985 --> 00:46:16,726
Scott: Don't mess that up.

827
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:18,533
Scott: I Think that's it.

828
00:46:19,299 --> 00:46:25,916
Rym: Yep, pretty much but I Feel like Pax is gonna have in the long run Hopefully 24/7 content.

829
00:46:25,956 --> 00:46:28,104
Rym: if they don't maybe we'll try to make that happen.

830
00:46:28,204 --> 00:46:31,870
Scott: Maybe we will but Pax Whoa, whoa, that's an idea.

831
00:46:32,272 --> 00:46:37,051
Rym: But you know we keep saying we want to make the GeekNights like a gaming con like a little thing and be just make It.

832
00:46:37,071 --> 00:46:39,563
Scott: just make it night at Pax instead geeky nights.

833
00:46:39,985 --> 00:46:41,090
Scott: It just be night at Pax.

834
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:42,529
Rym: It's so trivial to do.

835
00:46:42,731 --> 00:46:52,725
Rym: All we have to do is rent a hotel ballroom after between the hours of Pax closing and tax opening Just pick one of the hotels in Seattle and rent the rooms and sort it all out.

836
00:46:52,946 --> 00:46:54,551
Scott: and then we got to promote it big Time.

837
00:46:54,651 --> 00:46:55,795
Rym: Yeah, that wouldn't be hard to do.

838
00:46:55,876 --> 00:46:56,939
Rym: I'm sure we could work something out.

839
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,083
Rym: That's GeekNights.

840
00:46:58,304 --> 00:46:59,950
Rym: that that might happen.

841
00:47:00,352 --> 00:47:02,744
Rym: Yeah, that that's gonna be worked on.

842
00:47:02,824 --> 00:47:07,845
Scott: we could do that at Otakon too Like hey Otakon after the doors closed everyone come to this hotel ballroom.

843
00:47:08,026 --> 00:47:09,050
Rym: I would rather do it for Pax.

844
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:10,173
Scott: Yeah, me too.

845
00:47:10,855 --> 00:47:15,109
Scott: And basically if you have a Pax badge, we'll let you in and that'll be our policy, huh?

846
00:47:18,173 --> 00:47:19,533
Rym: This is Going to.

847
00:47:19,915 --> 00:47:22,527
Rym: you will hear news on this fairly quickly.

848
00:47:22,588 --> 00:47:24,958
Rym: after pack We get some sponsors as I sort.

849
00:47:24,978 --> 00:47:29,600
Scott: hopefully sumo will sponsor us so we can fill the room with bean bags And won't have to pay to rent tables and chairs.

850
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,270
Rym: All they have to do is pay me in bean bags.

851
00:47:31,611 --> 00:47:32,093
Scott: I know right.

852
00:47:32,133 --> 00:47:34,964
Scott: I'll say they got a. sumo has a green bean bag.

853
00:47:35,004 --> 00:47:39,083
Scott: now when I move a green bag Yes, when I move them getting one, I'm getting probably getting like three.

854
00:47:39,123 --> 00:47:42,138
Scott: I think I might get red green blue Even though they're expensive.

855
00:47:42,461 --> 00:47:42,904
Scott: It's worth it.

856
00:47:42,924 --> 00:47:50,656
Rym: All right I think we're done because I want to pack for packs and play games and packs Fuck.

Rym: What did you actually say?

00:47:59,405 --> 00:48:06,270
Rym: I forgot to say the word for You know this harkens back to when I was a little kid and I got in more trouble than Ida.

863
00:48:06,572 --> 00:48:26,325
Rym: I was really young and I meant I Honestly meant to call my little brother a name, and I did not mean to call him a scum fucker But I was gonna call him a scum bucket and I was gonna call him a scum sucker and I kind of didn't decide which one and I ended up calling him a scum bucker and I got in trouble.

864
00:48:27,172 --> 00:48:29,298
