1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,375
Rym: It's Monday February 9th.

2
00:00:11,655 --> 00:00:12,097
Scott: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,257 --> 00:00:14,363
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:14,724 --> 00:00:17,010
Rym: GPS's location and privacy.

5
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:26,916
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:33,489
Rym: Friday is a big day if you're a total nerd.

7
00:00:33,711 --> 00:00:39,050
Rym: I mean, I think things like this are neat, but I don't celebrate these holidays like I do other geekly holidays.

8
00:00:39,492 --> 00:00:43,086
Scott: Yeah, I don't really celebrate so many the hell geekly holidays.

9
00:00:43,146 --> 00:00:44,170
Scott: I sort of recognize them.

10
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,290
Scott: I have them on my Google Calendar, but I you know most of them.

11
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,787
Scott: I just give like a nod and that's my celebration.

12
00:00:49,867 --> 00:01:02,770
Rym: except for Well, I think the thing for me is that I Celebrate the holidays that are interesting to celebrate But I tend not to celebrate any of the geek holidays that involve big round numbers.

13
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:08,250
Rym: Yeah, like pi day mold a mold a I celebrated when I cared about organic chemistry.

14
00:01:08,912 --> 00:01:11,199
Rym: I no longer care about organic chemistry.

15
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,102
Scott: You know moles are not.

16
00:01:12,323 --> 00:01:19,750
Rym: moles are for any kind of chemistry not just organic Yes, but organic chemistry is what destroyed my love and interest in chemistry for the rest of forever.

17
00:01:20,312 --> 00:01:24,626
Scott: I kind of like you know like simple chemistries, but I don't like the complex chemistry.

18
00:01:24,686 --> 00:01:25,950
Rym: Yes, organic chemistry.

19
00:01:26,151 --> 00:01:33,889
Rym: I was cool with it until I realized that every lab Basically involved me taking naphthalene and making bad smelling things.

20
00:01:35,953 --> 00:01:39,265
Rym: At that point I decided that I didn't like bad smelling things.

21
00:01:39,606 --> 00:01:46,270
Scott: see my main problem with chemistry Is that it always involved like boiling something right and boil it like you would boil hydrochloric acid.

22
00:01:46,714 --> 00:01:53,190
Scott: I'd always just be like oh fuck shit Worried about spilling the acid on myself.

23
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:56,358
Scott: Okay, sure yeah, that's the thing right.

24
00:01:56,378 --> 00:01:57,661
Scott: you worried about spilling the acid.

25
00:01:57,681 --> 00:01:57,982
Scott: You know what.

26
00:01:58,022 --> 00:02:04,404
Scott: I'm twice as worried about spilling boiling acid Because you can't even like with the regular acid like in a beaker.

27
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:05,990
Scott: I can hold the beaker with my hand.

28
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,597
Scott: It's very sturdy grip.

29
00:02:07,617 --> 00:02:08,520
Scott: I'm not gonna spill it.

30
00:02:08,602 --> 00:02:14,947
Scott: You know with the boiling acid I have to pick up a big heavy beaker with like you know half a liter of acid with tongs.

31
00:02:15,428 --> 00:02:15,730
Scott: Oh, yeah

32
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:28,950
Rym: Actually what I was always kind of worried about wasn't so much the chemicals in the end But it was mostly the physical manipulation like we had to whenever we needed like glass pipettes or anything We had to make them ourselves like we had to go through full lab procedures.

33
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:45,556
Rym: So I'd have to take like this 10-foot piece of glass Score it in a couple of places kind of break it on the table and then you know oh take the Bunsen burner Melt the end so it kind of rounds out and do all this manipulation and more than one kid in my high school Totally shoved one of those things through their hand.

34
00:02:46,037 --> 00:02:53,906
Scott: Yeah, I was worried about like you know someone tripping and falling over like you know Like a power cord to a hot plate or something like that.

35
00:02:54,107 --> 00:03:00,170
Scott: Yeah Yeah, it was a lot scarier when I mean a good all the good labs and the power outlets up on the table.

36
00:03:00,531 --> 00:03:03,725
Scott: But even then yeah, of course luckily.

37
00:03:03,765 --> 00:03:04,830
Rym: I didn't realize until later.

38
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:08,909
Rym: I was always kind of worried that someone released like leave the gas out and just you know blow us all up.

39
00:03:09,197 --> 00:03:15,850
Rym: Yep I actually found out that none of the gas lines worked except in the senior labs because they never really used him.

40
00:03:16,177 --> 00:03:26,347
Scott: But yeah That's what I was worried about too is like because I'd sit in a lot of just like lecture classes that right have gas right In front of me and all I could think was the kids in this school aren't that smart.

41
00:03:26,467 --> 00:03:30,610
Scott: the thing is All the gases have central controls.

42
00:03:30,992 --> 00:03:37,529
Scott: It's like if the gas is turned on as soon as you smell it There's a big button to push that says turn it the fuck off even no matter which you know knob it is.

43
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:45,238
Scott: Yeah, that way you don't have to go searching for the knob while you asphyxiate right and they keep them off all the time Unless you're supposed to be using them right then.

44
00:03:45,438 --> 00:03:48,250
Rym: but Orgo was really scary partly because I didn't take it in high school.

45
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,356
Rym: I actually took night classes.

46
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,970
Rym: So I went to the local college and I took Orgo there.

47
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:53,437
Rym: So, you know, I'd like to really quit.

48
00:03:53,457 --> 00:03:54,481
Scott: How do we get to this topic?

49
00:03:54,963 --> 00:03:59,427
Scott: I don't know all day, right all day So Friday, but Friday is the day where?

50
00:04:01,335 --> 00:04:02,370
Rym: This is kind of arcane.

51
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:03,870
Scott: Oh, yeah, I should explain this right.

52
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:09,709
Scott: Well, so a computer a Unix computer a real computer pretty much anything but a Windows computer, right?

53
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:11,616
Scott: Keeps track of the time.

54
00:04:11,657 --> 00:04:12,340
Scott: It has a clock.

55
00:04:12,641 --> 00:04:14,410
Scott: Yeah, it wants to know what time it is, right?

56
00:04:15,031 --> 00:04:16,959
Scott: So how does the computer know what time it is?

57
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:27,179
Scott: Well, it has a number in it, right now It doesn't just have a number for hours and another number for minutes and another number for seconds and another number For date and another number for time.

58
00:04:27,219 --> 00:04:31,372
Rym: the reason for that is because that's a whole bunch of separate numbers not just that.

59
00:04:31,573 --> 00:04:40,702
Rym: math in regards to time sucks because time as we counted was invented by Barbarians from days long ago, right?

60
00:04:40,762 --> 00:04:42,730
Scott: So, how do they keep track of time?

61
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,686
Rym: I mean thing mod 31, but then it changes to mod 30, right?

62
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:49,920
Scott: Basil Unix was invented like in the 70s, right?

63
00:04:50,542 --> 00:04:58,952
Scott: So for the time in the computer It's the number of seconds that have passed since what midnight 1970?

64
00:04:58,952 --> 00:05:01,741
Scott: I think it's like something like that first way.

65
00:05:01,841 --> 00:05:03,065
Rym: I forget exactly what it is.

66
00:05:03,206 --> 00:05:03,748
Rym: It doesn't matter.

67
00:05:03,768 --> 00:05:04,410
Scott: It doesn't matter.

68
00:05:04,691 --> 00:05:08,170
Scott: So what you do is you look at that number of seconds, right?

69
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:13,030
Scott: And how many seconds are in a year - the new seconds for the leap days, you know.

70
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,055
Scott: I mean you can figure out.

71
00:05:14,396 --> 00:05:16,808
Scott: you know by math how many days have passed.

72
00:05:16,828 --> 00:05:21,109
Scott: for example I have the time now and I have the time five hours from now.

73
00:05:21,752 --> 00:05:22,515
Scott: It's going to be.

74
00:05:22,635 --> 00:05:24,382
Scott: if I subtract it's going to be.

75
00:05:24,904 --> 00:05:26,450
Scott: you know, five hours is what I said.

76
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:31,690
Scott: Right five times 60 times 60. right five hours times 60 minutes times 60 seconds.

77
00:05:32,111 --> 00:05:34,260
Rym: But anyway, this number just counts up now.

78
00:05:34,321 --> 00:05:40,505
Scott: eventually this number is gonna max out But you can just make it bigger and bigger with modern computers.

79
00:05:40,525 --> 00:05:44,984
Scott: We have 64-bit computers We can make 64-bit number will be good for the rest of our lives.

80
00:05:45,024 --> 00:05:47,495
Rym: Yeah, but you could talk well It depends.

81
00:05:47,655 --> 00:05:48,378
Rym: final question.

82
00:05:48,398 --> 00:05:50,024
Rym: I mean the last question.

83
00:05:50,064 --> 00:05:50,305
Scott: Yes.

84
00:05:50,345 --> 00:05:51,409
Rym: This is one of those.

85
00:05:51,711 --> 00:05:54,561
Scott: I think that the last I think we can ask it late.

86
00:05:54,601 --> 00:05:56,930
Scott: if we use a 64-bit number for the time.

87
00:05:57,593 --> 00:06:00,710
Scott: The last question will be a problem before we run out of time.

88
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,449
Rym: There's a quote in the slash shot article.

89
00:06:03,051 --> 00:06:13,517
Rym: Alan Cox does assure us that Linux is now working on 64-bit time and the Unix epoch rollover will happen Sometime around when the Sun burns out exactly.

90
00:06:13,537 --> 00:06:15,362
Scott: It's not like IPv6.

91
00:06:15,402 --> 00:06:18,670
Scott: It's a billion IPS per like square millimeter.

92
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:22,890
Scott: It's like we're not gonna run out on Friday the 13th 2009.

93
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,315
Scott: Oh snaps at 11 31 30 p.m Get your conspiracy theories.

94
00:06:29,012 --> 00:06:31,739
Rym: Unix time is going to reach 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0.

95
00:06:31,739 --> 00:06:32,922
Rym: Oh my god conspiracy.

96
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:36,595
Scott: It's the end of the world.

97
00:06:36,676 --> 00:06:37,301
Rym: Oh my god.

98
00:06:37,321 --> 00:06:40,600
Rym: So if you do a Numerologies, I don't know sir.

99
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,082
Scott: Davis.

100
00:06:41,243 --> 00:06:42,870
Rym: I don't know why they used Perl here.

101
00:06:42,931 --> 00:06:44,090
Rym: There are better ways to do this.

102
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:55,597
Rym: But if you do a Perl - e and then you just print scale our local time 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 9 0 It'll tell you, you know, you can just do date percent s. Yeah Anyway, this is you can do.

103
00:06:55,757 --> 00:07:00,230
Rym: you can do watch date percent s watch but watch only updates every two seconds.

104
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,190
Scott: You could tell it to update every one second.

105
00:07:02,443 --> 00:07:03,954
Rym: Yeah But only every one seconds.

106
00:07:03,994 --> 00:07:06,642
Rym: you could be up to point nine seconds off.

107
00:07:06,822 --> 00:07:09,510
Scott: you could write you could take an alarm clock program.

108
00:07:09,732 --> 00:07:10,761
Scott: Set it for that time.

109
00:07:11,124 --> 00:07:13,618
Rym: tada How do you know what?

110
00:07:13,658 --> 00:07:14,345
Rym: it doesn't really matter.

111
00:07:14,425 --> 00:07:14,950
Scott: it doesn't matter.

112
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:21,433
Scott: It's just an arbitrary number is sort of like, you know, oh my god the year 2000 was just an arbitrary number on the year You know, but it's big.

113
00:07:21,734 --> 00:07:24,142
Scott: it is big and round arbitrary and round.

114
00:07:24,162 --> 00:07:30,753
Scott: people love those round numbers in symmetries except for 2012.

115
00:07:30,753 --> 00:07:32,243
Rym: That one kind of came out of nowhere.

116
00:07:32,806 --> 00:07:35,605
Rym: All right That's how you know, it's legit.

117
00:07:36,613 --> 00:07:39,225
Scott: Do I talk about news or should I talk about work business?

118
00:07:39,586 --> 00:07:40,350
Rym: you got work business?

119
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,097
Rym: Yeah, I heard rumblings in the forum.

120
00:07:42,157 --> 00:07:43,123
Scott: There are some rumblings.

121
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:50,290
Scott: basically, you know This has been something in my work for some time and you know, they I sort of stroll into work.

122
00:07:50,631 --> 00:07:51,294
Scott: You know what?

123
00:07:51,314 --> 00:07:52,679
Scott: I want to and leave.

124
00:07:53,302 --> 00:07:54,125
Rym: what I want to.

125
00:07:54,206 --> 00:08:00,590
Scott: it was my life at IBM Which is you know enough time to get the show done and get on the train and do the commute and the whole thing.

126
00:08:00,671 --> 00:08:02,264
Scott: Right, you know, I'm not gonna give you know.

127
00:08:02,284 --> 00:08:11,069
Scott: with this commute I'm not about to spend extra hours at work because it means I get home like an hour and a half later and that it's Like, you know, it's it's terrible, you know, it's not good.

128
00:08:11,573 --> 00:08:22,405
Scott: And then if I stay at work too long and I do the show I don't get enough sleep and then even if I go to work at the right time I'm sleeping on the desk and not eating three meals because I don't get home time for dinner.

129
00:08:22,726 --> 00:08:25,009
Scott: and if I could buy dinner But it's too much money, right?

130
00:08:26,591 --> 00:08:35,809
Scott: So basically I you know my we never had these before because I've been working there for two years And it was just sort of laid-back, but we got acquired recently, which I think I talked about.

131
00:08:36,613 --> 00:08:38,388
Scott: so now it's much more corporate and such.

132
00:08:38,408 --> 00:08:46,386
Scott: and Basically, you know, I had a yearly review And I had been told that they wanted me to stay there for longer hours and I'd be like, uh-huh.

133
00:08:46,587 --> 00:08:47,390
Scott: Yeah, it's not gonna happen.

134
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:55,349
Scott: So today was that the review which is all formal and office space kind of shit, right?

135
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:55,670
Scott: It's weird.

136
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:59,110
Rym: I I've never really worked at a company where I had to go through anything like that.

137
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:03,809
Rym: Views have always been like we go out to lunch and we just kind of chat and then that's it.

138
00:09:04,832 --> 00:09:10,234
Scott: So the review is pretty much instead of I thought I was I walked in and I'm like Are you letting me go?

139
00:09:10,254 --> 00:09:12,725
Scott: and they're like, you know, do you want to be let go?

140
00:09:12,765 --> 00:09:17,849
Scott: and I'm like kind of It would have just been easier that way.

141
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:19,776
Rym: But that's the office space answer.

142
00:09:19,796 --> 00:09:23,247
Rym: because remember in office space the less he cared the more they wanted to keep it.

143
00:09:23,548 --> 00:09:27,140
Scott: I know right No, but basically they wanted me.

144
00:09:27,743 --> 00:09:29,270
Scott: they basically wanted more from me.

145
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:33,022
Scott: They're like, they think I'm a brilliant technological genius.

146
00:09:33,102 --> 00:09:35,390
Scott: That is just not working hard enough.

147
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,181
Scott: They're like we need you to work more hours.

148
00:09:38,282 --> 00:09:41,982
Scott: Like if there's a problem at like 11 at night We need to be able to call you and fix it.

149
00:09:42,022 --> 00:09:46,244
Rym: I'm like, uh-huh Now what you could have done it because there is a price.

150
00:09:46,264 --> 00:09:47,730
Rym: there's always a price.

151
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:50,701
Rym: You could have said what the price is for that from you.

152
00:09:50,822 --> 00:09:52,950
Scott: The thing is I am incredibly honest, you know.

153
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:59,103
Scott: So I'm like look, all right, I Care more about stuff outside of work than I care about work.

154
00:09:59,143 --> 00:10:00,990
Scott: And in fact, I really don't care about this work.

155
00:10:01,432 --> 00:10:06,033
Scott: I only care about it because a the money pays for what I do that I do care about.

156
00:10:06,434 --> 00:10:08,341
Scott: and be you know, you people are cool.

157
00:10:08,401 --> 00:10:13,990
Scott: I like you people, you know, I just this work I don't give a shit about right, you know, I don't care about the company.

158
00:10:14,131 --> 00:10:15,800
Scott: I just you know, it's sort of like.

159
00:10:16,243 --> 00:10:21,450
Scott: the only reason I'm still here Is that if I leave it's sort of like giving you guys, you know the dick move, right?

160
00:10:21,932 --> 00:10:36,559
Scott: Because I mean if I leave the other guy is all you know, the other developer guy he already Sort of, you know works incredibly crazy hours, and I think he's crazy, you know, but you know from their perspective They think it's unfair, you know, which is completely understandable.

161
00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:38,023
Scott: It's like they're working the hours.

162
00:10:38,044 --> 00:10:40,170
Scott: They're supposed to they see me strolling out.

163
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:41,575
Scott: They're like, oh, it's not fair.

164
00:10:41,635 --> 00:10:45,870
Scott: He's leaving but of course the at the same time I look at them and I go they're crazy.

165
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:50,962
Rym: they're Better ways to handle this than your company is handling it.

166
00:10:50,982 --> 00:10:52,006
Rym: I mean like what do we do?

167
00:10:52,047 --> 00:10:52,830
Rym: my company we need?

168
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:56,302
Rym: People to support the production environment from 7 a.m.

169
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,909
Rym: To 6 p.m So what do we do?

170
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,738
Rym: We don't hire someone to sit there from 7 a.m.

171
00:11:00,758 --> 00:11:02,544
Rym: To 6 p.m We have me.

172
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,431
Rym: I come in from I work 7 to 4.

173
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:06,939
Rym: We have someone else who works 9 to 6.

174
00:11:06,939 --> 00:11:16,739
Scott: Yeah, the thing is even 6 is like too late, you know and You know, there's the 7 to 4 guy and you know the company I mean, they they're only right.

175
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,282
Scott: I went.

176
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:19,390
Scott: I started working there two years ago, right?

177
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:24,409
Scott: And if you don't count the people who work for the company that acquired us you only count for people who work for.

178
00:11:24,569 --> 00:11:25,714
Scott: you know Our part.

179
00:11:26,296 --> 00:11:29,269
Scott: there are only five people there who have been there longer than me.

180
00:11:29,329 --> 00:11:31,329
Scott: now It's kind of four of them are named Mike.

181
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:32,514
Rym: It's got two of them.

182
00:11:32,855 --> 00:11:38,737
Scott: two of them work outside of the you know away from the office most of the time because you know They work from their homes most of the time.

183
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:44,870
Rym: Well, of course remember when I worked at the hospital I went through four and a half managers because they kept quitting.

184
00:11:46,571 --> 00:11:54,149
Scott: So it's I'm sort of in a situation though because like I've looked at some other jobs I've applied around right and it seems like, you know, I could get another job.

185
00:11:54,892 --> 00:11:59,546
Scott: But a lot of those other places it's like they also want someone to work crazy hours.

186
00:11:59,646 --> 00:12:02,294
Scott: and I'm like, you know, look That's just.

187
00:12:02,475 --> 00:12:08,790
Scott: it's probably not gonna happen unless you know Your company is like way awesome and I own it or something like that.

188
00:12:09,293 --> 00:12:11,730
Rym: Or they pay enough to where then you quit after a year.

189
00:12:12,911 --> 00:12:14,056
Scott: That's the other problem.

190
00:12:14,117 --> 00:12:17,754
Scott: right is if anyone pays me enough money Right.

191
00:12:18,136 --> 00:12:21,250
Scott: I might like let's say someone paid me two hundred thousand dollars a year, right?

192
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:24,585
Scott: It's some crazy amount of money right and that's pretty crazy for me, right?

193
00:12:24,605 --> 00:12:27,741
Scott: I Would work for one year.

194
00:12:27,761 --> 00:12:29,349
Scott: I would work crazy for one year.

195
00:12:29,369 --> 00:12:33,910
Scott: hell I'd put off GeekNights and everything else for exactly one year, maybe two years.

196
00:12:33,971 --> 00:12:36,692
Rym: I mean then you have twice as much at 400,000 Cuz.

197
00:12:36,712 --> 00:12:40,082
Scott: that's a slippery slope, you know, it would be about a year basically cuz.

198
00:12:40,102 --> 00:12:41,748
Scott: that way I'd make sure I get any 401k rollovers.

199
00:12:42,571 --> 00:12:43,819
Scott: I do the taxes, right?

200
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,529
Scott: I Would probably have after that year was over.

201
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:54,582
Scott: I would have a hundred thousand dollars in the bank in cash because my cost of living is so low and I wouldn't go and buy extra luxuries.

202
00:12:55,513 --> 00:12:57,610
Scott: Then I would just run away to Europe or something crazy.

203
00:12:57,671 --> 00:12:59,630
Scott: You know have a hundred thousand dollars in cash.

204
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:03,209
Scott: I could live for like three years or four years on that without having to work.

205
00:13:03,832 --> 00:13:10,129
Scott: So no one can afford to pay me that much money cuz I'll just leave You know, so I and I don't know what I could do.

206
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:14,908
Scott: But I if I can either a I can find a job that doesn't want me to work.

207
00:13:14,948 --> 00:13:17,747
Scott: crazy Be find a job that'll pay me a shit ton of money.

208
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,779
Scott: Or see I get rich some by some miracle.

209
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,650
Rym: lottery on FARC sees usually the option that ends with you in jail.

210
00:13:26,551 --> 00:13:27,675
Scott: Jail is an option.

211
00:13:27,756 --> 00:13:30,266
Scott: At least at least I don't have to work so hard in jail.

212
00:13:30,487 --> 00:13:31,090
Rym: It is an option.

213
00:13:32,195 --> 00:13:42,470
Rym: Make license plates nice nice and comfortable, you know If you're an open-source guy and you're you really want to learn something that you can learn from slightly out-of-date books.

214
00:13:43,453 --> 00:13:50,244
Rym: You could go to jail for a year Lift weights read books someone pay if I just had a computer with the internet in jail.

215
00:13:50,264 --> 00:13:53,927
Scott: I could be like, you know be great.

216
00:13:55,332 --> 00:14:01,069
Scott: Well, except for I mean, I'm not allowed to make money while I'm in jail But basically I would work for you.

217
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:07,499
Scott: You would collect all this money into a company and then when I came out of jail You would give me my half of the company.

218
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,449
Rym: So is this the plan now?

219
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,183
Scott: The plan is you to go to jail for me to do the company.

220
00:14:13,384 --> 00:14:14,730
Rym: I'm more of a front man.

221
00:14:14,811 --> 00:14:15,905
Rym: I'll set all this up for you.

222
00:14:15,925 --> 00:14:20,401
Scott: And then Yeah, come out of jail and you're like, hey Scott.

223
00:14:20,441 --> 00:14:21,645
Scott: Yeah, it's a nice hobo beard.

224
00:14:21,665 --> 00:14:22,950
Scott: You guys what half company?

225
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:23,615
Scott: What what's good?

226
00:14:23,635 --> 00:14:24,788
Scott: I don't even know who this guy is.

227
00:14:25,351 --> 00:14:27,237
Scott: So I'm not hiring ex-con.

228
00:14:27,257 --> 00:14:28,360
Scott: the investors wouldn't like that.

229
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:31,549
Rym: I finally get out of the joint and you pick me up.

230
00:14:39,053 --> 00:14:41,866
Scott: Maybe I should go to jail if something like that'll happen.

231
00:14:41,886 --> 00:14:42,609
Scott: It'd be totally worth it.

232
00:14:45,371 --> 00:14:47,619
Rym: Anyway, so what are you on the news captain McNews?

233
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,450
Scott: Okay, so people may know I have an iPhone, right?

234
00:14:51,215 --> 00:14:53,229
Scott: But I don't use mobile me, you know.

235
00:14:53,511 --> 00:14:59,710
Scott: So I have the problem in that there's some Google stuff on the iPhone, but most of it is not so great, right?

236
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:03,403
Scott: It's like I can't use the integrated calendar on the iPhone.

237
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:06,435
Scott: I have to like go to the Google Calendar website I can't use.

238
00:15:06,797 --> 00:15:09,470
Scott: you know, I can't get my Gmail push to the iPhone.

239
00:15:09,611 --> 00:15:13,850
Scott: I have to use IMAP and like, you know, it automatically checks it every 15 minutes or so.

240
00:15:14,492 --> 00:15:21,698
Scott: I can't get my Gmail contacts onto the iPhone, but I really care about contacts, you know It's mostly the calendar that I care about.

241
00:15:21,739 --> 00:15:30,174
Scott: I want to use the iPhone calendar application But I want it to be my Google Calendar and the ways to do that existed but they sucked.

242
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:37,257
Scott: the easiest way to do it would have been a I have to buy a copy of Outlook and Be I have to sync with a wire.

243
00:15:37,598 --> 00:15:43,738
Scott: right my iPhone to iTunes iTunes syncs with Outlook Outlook syncs with this tool.

244
00:15:43,999 --> 00:15:46,770
Scott: the tool syncs with Google and Google makes the tool part, right?

245
00:15:48,092 --> 00:15:56,484
Scott: See I'm only syncing my calendar when I'm at home and going through all those different applications Basically removing the point of even having the kind of moving the point of even right.

246
00:15:56,785 --> 00:15:58,150
Scott: so Google came out today.

247
00:15:58,932 --> 00:16:00,396
Scott: They paid Microsoft.

248
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:05,290
Scott: This is the first time that Google or Microsoft has ever licensed the others intellectual property ever.

249
00:16:05,934 --> 00:16:07,929
Scott: They licensed Microsoft's active sync.

250
00:16:08,855 --> 00:16:13,719
Scott: Active sync is the thing that lets phones Synchronize with exchange servers, right?

251
00:16:14,301 --> 00:16:20,504
Scott: So if your work has an exchange server and You got your Windows mobile phone and you synchronize with it.

252
00:16:20,524 --> 00:16:22,070
Scott: You're using active sync, right?

253
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:26,786
Scott: It's the same thing that you know, the iPhone uses to sync with exchange servers and such and such.

254
00:16:26,806 --> 00:16:29,093
Scott: right blackberries Don't use active sync.

255
00:16:29,394 --> 00:16:31,139
Scott: You have to get a blackberry server.

256
00:16:31,179 --> 00:16:33,988
Scott: That is a separate add-on to the exchange server, right?

257
00:16:34,549 --> 00:16:39,490
Scott: Anyway So Google licensed active sync from Microsoft.

258
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:58,780
Scott: They paid Microsoft money and now you can synchronize your iPhone or a bunch of other phones Blackberries and all sorts of things with your Google, you know stuff your Google account Over the air with pushy with push everything right synchronize both ways don't have to plug it in.

259
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:02,864
Scott: The problem number always a problem.

260
00:17:03,005 --> 00:17:10,589
Scott: number one problem The iPhone specifically can only synchronize with one exchange server at a time.

261
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,638
Rym: now I've said this before but I need to say it again.

262
00:17:12,659 --> 00:17:16,609
Rym: This is that's like the most ludicrous Restriction is completely retarded.

263
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:24,976
Scott: So this means if you let's say you have an iPhone and you use it to synchronize with your work email You cannot use Google sync.

264
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:29,709
Scott: you can't because you would have to basically stop syncing with your work and sync with Google.

265
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:30,030
Scott: instead.

266
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,435
Scott: You can't do both at the same time.

267
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:32,941
Scott: I can do like a hundred.

268
00:17:33,081 --> 00:17:40,396
Scott: I'm at mail servers killed you one Active sync, it's like really Honestly, honestly, really?

269
00:17:40,596 --> 00:17:42,806
Scott: Seriously, there's no reason for that.

270
00:17:42,866 --> 00:17:43,669
Scott: It's completely stupid.

271
00:17:45,111 --> 00:17:48,521
Scott: Problem number two, and this is really really stupid.

272
00:17:49,063 --> 00:17:51,510
Scott: It only synchronizes your contacts and your calendar.

273
00:17:51,751 --> 00:17:53,056
Scott: It doesn't synchronize mail yet.

274
00:17:53,357 --> 00:17:55,284
Rym: So basically it does nothing.

275
00:17:55,525 --> 00:17:56,750
Scott: basically does nothing, right?

276
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,842
Scott: It's it's beta still but I mean come on.

277
00:17:58,882 --> 00:18:00,110
Scott: It doesn't synchronize the mail.

278
00:18:00,451 --> 00:18:11,550
Scott: So if I wanted to use this I would have to synchronize with my company's email by IMAP synchronize with my gmail by IMAP and Synchronize with my calendar and contacts only by push.

279
00:18:12,611 --> 00:18:13,374
Scott: That's not worth.

280
00:18:13,836 --> 00:18:17,189
Rym: They have basically released the goggles and nothing more, right?

281
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:31,510
Scott: I mean If you only use Google stuff, maybe it'll be worth it to use the push because you can't get the Gmail by push Anyway, so you might as well do it with IMAP and then synchronize the other stuff with the push because you're not using it.

282
00:18:32,572 --> 00:18:37,330
Scott: But I mean, come on see I guess push it's still not a real solution.

283
00:18:37,711 --> 00:18:39,579
Scott: It's the one thing I can say in their favor.

284
00:18:40,061 --> 00:18:42,270
Scott: They did release it for Google apps right away.

285
00:18:42,713 --> 00:18:45,030
Scott: They're not giving Google apps people to stick anymore.

286
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:48,421
Rym: Finally, we've been living on like the second class citizen island for a while.

287
00:18:48,441 --> 00:18:51,070
Scott: Anyone who is a front row crew Google apps.

288
00:18:51,492 --> 00:18:52,235
Scott: You can.

289
00:18:52,496 --> 00:18:53,681
Scott: you can use this if you want.

290
00:18:54,465 --> 00:18:58,250
Rym: I guess at least luckily one I'm still using like the original razor.

291
00:18:58,955 --> 00:19:00,890
Scott: No my cell phone because you only make calls.

292
00:19:00,972 --> 00:19:07,550
Rym: I mean Well, I have the word blackberry which I use as my blackberry and I I don't really care about push because work.

293
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:14,030
Rym: I need push because I'll be on call for things sometimes but for my real life, I don't really need push.

294
00:19:14,532 --> 00:19:16,099
Rym: Yeah, I understand how it can be useful.

295
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:18,047
Rym: It's not like I'm gonna be you punk kids.

296
00:19:18,087 --> 00:19:18,770
Rym: Why do you need push?

297
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,635
Rym: I understand why some people would need push.

298
00:19:21,357 --> 00:19:22,279
Rym: I only need pull.

299
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,970
Rym: In fact, I dislike anytime media is pushed upon me.

300
00:19:26,391 --> 00:19:30,730
Scott: I like well, I kind of like, you know being notified of like a new email or something.

301
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:34,001
Rym: yeah, only if I'm at a con where it would matter.

302
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:39,670
Rym: like say I email Luke crane and I'm like Yeah at the con blah blah blah and I want him to email me back.

303
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:48,041
Rym: The only way for him to get my attention is to call me or send me a text message and text messages suck And I don't like answering my phone to push emails.

304
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,767
Rym: great for that, but that's the only time.

305
00:19:50,449 --> 00:19:52,797
Scott: so Hmm I like.

306
00:19:52,978 --> 00:19:53,861
Scott: I like pushing big.

307
00:19:53,921 --> 00:19:54,242
Scott: I guess it.

308
00:19:54,323 --> 00:19:56,330
Scott: what it is is that you're the pusher robot.

309
00:19:56,531 --> 00:19:57,594
Scott: I don't have that.

310
00:19:57,714 --> 00:20:02,990
Scott: I mean if if I have the thing constantly buzzing with shit, it's like fuck that right?

311
00:20:03,571 --> 00:20:15,248
Scott: But if every push is something significant, you know like I'd recently went through and I've just been unsubscribing like crazy from all these bullshit newsletters that you sort of accidentally sign up for even though you try not to.

312
00:20:15,528 --> 00:20:27,309
Rym: when you like Websites and things one thing it does do that I can see is if every email you get is significant or you have good filters In place is that it removes the desire to go and check your email exactly.

313
00:20:27,329 --> 00:20:27,630
Scott: That's right.

314
00:20:27,831 --> 00:20:36,250
Scott: I mean not only have I unsubscribe from all these bullshit newsletters But I have filters in place that move all sort of like the automatic emails into a separate folder.

315
00:20:36,411 --> 00:20:43,610
Scott: So like if someone follows me on Twitter, I don't I get an email but it goes into a separate folder So that I you know, it's just sort of hidden.

316
00:20:44,112 --> 00:20:48,950
Scott: So every email that actually ends up in my inbox is a real email.

317
00:20:49,131 --> 00:20:53,630
Scott: That's like the real deal for me and I you know, that's something that is seriously want to read.

318
00:20:54,072 --> 00:20:59,810
Rym: yeah, well I the thing is I get more and more because I tend to do more of the producer side of GeekNights.

319
00:21:00,649 --> 00:21:06,170
Rym: I Get a lot of email from various press outlets and it's not easy to filter it because it comes from a lot of different sources.

320
00:21:06,652 --> 00:21:09,482
Rym: Like I'm on these lists where I'll get.

321
00:21:09,542 --> 00:21:16,524
Scott: you could always they'll filter out the the GeekNights emails from you know, the ones that are to GeekNights I don't know.

322
00:21:16,831 --> 00:21:18,388
Rym: I'm talking about the ones that go to me.

323
00:21:19,272 --> 00:21:24,328
Rym: My personal email is also on all these lists because I'm like I'm the point of contact for all.

324
00:21:24,348 --> 00:21:30,384
Scott: you could do stuff Like if the email, you know There's filters that you can do that say like if I am the sole recipient do this.

325
00:21:30,465 --> 00:21:32,595
Scott: if I am NOT the sole recipient Do something else.

326
00:21:32,636 --> 00:21:34,610
Scott: that way you can get off lists and things.

327
00:21:34,871 --> 00:21:39,342
Rym: I think what I need to do is eventually just make another email alias.

328
00:21:39,402 --> 00:21:40,184
Rym: That is just.

329
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:42,250
Rym: you know personal personal personal.

330
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,695
Scott: Yeah, we could do that too.

331
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:45,883
Rym: And then you know Rym at frontrowcrew.com.

332
00:21:45,903 --> 00:21:46,887
Rym: basically is the.

333
00:21:47,248 --> 00:21:50,800
Scott: you know Exeter sucks though that Rym isn't the personal one.

334
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,670
Scott: It's like you'd want that to be the real one because it's the stage name.

335
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:54,995
Rym: I mean, it can't be the real one.

336
00:21:55,517 --> 00:21:57,905
Scott: There's no way you can use like Brandon the coster.

337
00:21:57,925 --> 00:21:59,230
Scott: I think you have that anyway.

338
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:01,649
Rym: Yeah, I do but no one in the world owes me by that name.

339
00:22:02,273 --> 00:22:05,549
Rym: Like people I work with and even them they kind of they kind of know the deal.

340
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:06,554
Rym: All right, like.

341
00:22:07,096 --> 00:22:10,249
Rym: no one calls me that but I like it met like gave in taiko, right?

342
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:15,569
Rym: There is no way either of them could ever even check Gabe or taiko at penny arcade.

343
00:22:15,589 --> 00:22:18,056
Rym: calm Yeah, the same deal.

344
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:20,750
Rym: Yeah, I mean any listener can figure out my email address.

345
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:21,493
Rym: I have to have the.

346
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:25,690
Rym: you know Rym - you're actually my friend at front row crew.

347
00:22:27,117 --> 00:22:27,318
Scott: I can.

348
00:22:27,338 --> 00:22:28,403
Scott: may I just tell me what you want.

349
00:22:28,443 --> 00:22:28,825
Scott: I'll make it.

350
00:22:28,966 --> 00:22:29,689
Rym: Yeah, I'll figure it out.

351
00:22:30,631 --> 00:22:34,220
Rym: Well, yeah, anyway along those lines actually not along those lines at all.

352
00:22:34,822 --> 00:22:37,730
Rym: the the Kindle was announced actually like it.

353
00:22:37,912 --> 00:22:38,790
Rym: It was leaked already.

354
00:22:38,851 --> 00:22:44,670
Rym: You could have found most of this stuff out already But the Kindle 2 is out and you can read all the business and there's a million videos.

355
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:45,654
Scott: You're not gonna break it down.

356
00:22:45,674 --> 00:22:46,919
Rym: I am gonna break it down.

357
00:22:46,979 --> 00:22:47,642
Scott: All right, break it down.

358
00:22:47,883 --> 00:22:50,391
Rym: Basically, it's $360.

359
00:22:50,391 --> 00:22:53,001
Rym: Mm-hmm, which is I'm gonna wait.

360
00:22:53,162 --> 00:22:53,804
Rym: That's too much money.

361
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:55,732
Rym: I Really?

362
00:22:55,813 --> 00:23:00,277
Scott: I'll tell you what I think of it when you when you're done Like I really really want one.

363
00:23:00,317 --> 00:23:09,390
Rym: and I gotta say like they were talking about how it's a lot thinner than the original which I Found hard to believe when I heard that rumor because the original was already pretty freakin thin.

364
00:23:09,991 --> 00:23:12,699
Rym: This thing is thinner than the iPhone like it's tiny.

365
00:23:12,739 --> 00:23:24,709
Rym: It's like a. it like it's smaller than anything I carry around But it's $360 and you still can't just put PDFs on it.

366
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:25,776
Rym: Like.

367
00:23:25,816 --> 00:23:27,246
Rym: those are the two things that really bugged me.

368
00:23:27,266 --> 00:23:27,830
Rym: but I mean otherwise.

369
00:23:28,472 --> 00:23:29,635
Rym: The screen is a lot better.

370
00:23:29,695 --> 00:23:30,979
Rym: Like it's a lot more contrast.

371
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:37,237
Rym: It changes pages a lot faster, which might sound dumb, but Using the old Kindle like it took it.

372
00:23:37,538 --> 00:23:41,550
Scott: Yeah, you listen to our episode about you know, ebook readers and the screens and whatever.

373
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:44,619
Rym: I'm trying to avoid talking about anything that we covered there.

374
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:49,843
Rym: Yes, like general needs but it took it a Noticeable amount of time to flip pages.

375
00:23:49,923 --> 00:23:54,447
Rym: It wasn't a deal-breaker But like you noticed and you kind of went and it sped up.

376
00:23:54,487 --> 00:23:55,010
Scott: now to the point.

377
00:23:55,191 --> 00:24:05,950
Scott: I'm sure though that when they make a the Kindle 3 or the Kindle Nana or whatever that it will flip pages even faster And that the car the new one will seem slow, you know, but I was watching videos of the difference.

378
00:24:06,593 --> 00:24:11,134
Rym: It is fast enough now to where it is no longer a concern of mine Like it is.

379
00:24:11,557 --> 00:24:12,743
Rym: I no longer care about that.

380
00:24:12,783 --> 00:24:16,899
Rym: It already flips fast enough Yeah, but the battery lasts a whole bunch longer.

381
00:24:17,421 --> 00:24:18,484
Rym: the screens a lot sharp.

382
00:24:18,524 --> 00:24:20,330
Scott: battery lasts for fucking ever apparently.

383
00:24:20,451 --> 00:24:27,506
Rym: Yeah, they it lasts officially 25% longer, but I'm hearing reports that it basically is now like the Nintendo DS.

384
00:24:27,546 --> 00:24:38,818
Rym: You just never charge it Yeah, and the other thing that was interesting was that they Sorry Basically, they made the screen like actually sharper.

385
00:24:38,858 --> 00:24:42,510
Rym: There are more levels of darkness that it can display.

386
00:24:42,651 --> 00:24:44,881
Scott: There's 16 colors of gray something like that.

387
00:24:44,982 --> 00:24:46,770
Rym: Yeah, and I can't verify that in person.

388
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:47,754
Rym: I haven't touched one yet.

389
00:24:47,814 --> 00:24:52,030
Rym: But as far as the internet has said it really stands out as being different.

390
00:24:52,392 --> 00:24:56,390
Rym: Mmm, and other than that, they haven't really changed anything.

391
00:24:56,531 --> 00:24:57,976
Scott: Yeah, here's is the thing.

392
00:24:58,036 --> 00:25:00,846
Scott: is I really wanted to want a Kindle right?

393
00:25:00,906 --> 00:25:01,890
Scott: What do I like about it?

394
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:02,732
Rym: Oh, no thing.

395
00:25:03,033 --> 00:25:04,958
Rym: They added text-to-speech again.

396
00:25:05,178 --> 00:25:05,499
Rym: Why?

397
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,344
Scott: well, that's good for people who can't.

398
00:25:07,524 --> 00:25:14,110
Rym: you know see but there are better ways You know if you can't see you don't really need a Kindle.

399
00:25:14,291 --> 00:25:17,708
Rym: You need a purpose device for people who can't see.

400
00:25:17,848 --> 00:25:25,656
Scott: I know Yeah, if you can also you can listen to audible audiobooks on it, but I can do that on my you know I thought right which is smaller.

401
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:27,982
Scott: Um, so I wanted to want the Kindle.

402
00:25:28,022 --> 00:25:29,145
Scott: Why did I want to want it?

403
00:25:29,165 --> 00:25:31,252
Scott: Well, I Had.

404
00:25:31,895 --> 00:25:32,317
Scott: I hate.

405
00:25:32,438 --> 00:25:33,944
Scott: I like reading to want me.

406
00:25:34,105 --> 00:25:35,150
Scott: I like reading a lot.

407
00:25:36,331 --> 00:25:36,953
Scott: You can stop.

408
00:25:37,114 --> 00:25:38,619
Scott: I want lots of books.

409
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,769
Scott: I want to pay less for those lots of books, right?

410
00:25:41,809 --> 00:25:47,390
Scott: So Sometimes Kindle books are more expensive than actual books and sometimes they're less expensive, right?

411
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:58,227
Rym: I don't even like care about that because basically even if Kindle books cost more Well carrying around physical books if it's just text like if I'm reading, you know, farewell to arms or something.

412
00:25:58,247 --> 00:26:00,616
Rym: I Just want the words.

413
00:26:00,717 --> 00:26:01,922
Rym: I don't care about anything else.

414
00:26:02,163 --> 00:26:04,439
Rym: now if I'm carrying around the mouse guard book I don't want the Kindle.

415
00:26:04,459 --> 00:26:07,496
Rym: I want the mouse guard book Yeah, but I'd only.

416
00:26:07,597 --> 00:26:11,730
Rym: I want a device where I can just read what I want without having to buy and carry around physical books.

417
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:13,999
Scott: Yeah, but the thing is here's the problems right.

418
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:14,622
Scott: number one.

419
00:26:15,164 --> 00:26:24,370
Scott: when I buy physical books I mean book lending happens a lot, you know, it's not like with other things like with music or movies, right?

420
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,309
Scott: There's not a lot of lending going on.

421
00:26:26,491 --> 00:26:32,729
Scott: Usually, you know you watch a movie together with all your friends and then you know Maybe you rent it or what you'll stream it or something like that.

422
00:26:33,132 --> 00:26:34,662
Scott: So you don't need to have it and lend it.

423
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:35,729
Scott: but books.

424
00:26:36,651 --> 00:26:39,038
Scott: There's a lot of lending especially like comic books.

425
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:40,583
Scott: I lend them like crazy, right.

426
00:26:40,663 --> 00:26:42,930
Scott: so well basically the DRM to ebook.

427
00:26:43,252 --> 00:26:44,399
Scott: There's no lending going on.

428
00:26:44,439 --> 00:26:46,370
Rym: It's not even just that it's a more fundamental issue.

429
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:48,618
Scott: So why am I paying this price?

430
00:26:48,939 --> 00:26:52,150
Scott: that could possibly be more than the cost of the paper bag?

431
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:59,480
Scott: Clearly it's for the convenience of having the yeah, but I'm losing the lending ability Which I care about much more than the space taking ability.

432
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,743
Rym: Well, I care more about.

433
00:27:00,764 --> 00:27:04,963
Rym: well in for me personally I care more about the space and the convenience.

434
00:27:04,983 --> 00:27:08,179
Scott: I care about the space a lot But not as much as a lending.

435
00:27:08,219 --> 00:27:09,445
Rym: but the lending is not the issue.

436
00:27:09,526 --> 00:27:19,277
Rym: It's much deeper than that And I've realized this and I've mentioned it before but it really hit home when I actually went from yeah ebook readers to will I buy this?

437
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:26,059
Rym: and I realized that I can't buy the Kindle because I can't support The erosion of first sale rights.

438
00:27:26,882 --> 00:27:36,270
Rym: I have a right to first sale the fact that DRM and we saw this in video games with downloadable content and we're seeing this now with ebook readers and with Netflix and these things.

439
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:42,397
Rym: But I think it's going to be a serious issue that is going to affect lower income classes of

440
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:43,181
Scott: people

441
00:27:43,664 --> 00:28:00,416
Rym: as time goes on that because secondary sales are increasing and Pete there's so much media that People will they're more willing to buy use things or borrow or lend not even pirate but perfectly legally get used DVDs You know rent in return these sorts of things.

442
00:28:00,577 --> 00:28:01,600
Scott: I just saw it speak.

443
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,906
Scott: I I just sold right the.

444
00:28:04,046 --> 00:28:05,390
Scott: I sold four things on Amazon.

445
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,974
Scott: I just mailed the last one today.

446
00:28:07,375 --> 00:28:08,097
Scott: They all sold.

447
00:28:08,658 --> 00:28:10,242
Scott: someone bought Gundam f91.

448
00:28:10,262 --> 00:28:13,490
Rym: Haven't helped them losing the right of first sale?

449
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:23,942
Rym: well, I think is going to have far-reaching societal implications that I am not comfortable with mm-hmm and That coupled with the fact that because it is DRM.

450
00:28:24,022 --> 00:28:25,929
Rym: I'm basically renting these books not buying them.

451
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:37,010
Rym: I've decided in the end that just philosophically and morally I cannot support the Kindle as long as It is set up in such a way that I lose the right to first.

452
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:42,373
Scott: Yeah, I mean if I buy a paperback book I can sell it again on Amazon Kindle book.

453
00:28:42,694 --> 00:28:44,038
Scott: you're stuck with that book forever.

454
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:45,282
Rym: Well, not even forever.

455
00:28:45,442 --> 00:28:46,345
Rym: Never say forever.

456
00:28:46,405 --> 00:28:47,127
Rym: It's DRM.

457
00:28:47,568 --> 00:28:48,270
Rym: It's not forever.

458
00:28:48,391 --> 00:28:49,747
Rym: It's you know a number of years.

459
00:28:49,827 --> 00:28:52,502
Scott: maybe You know, it's stuck on your Kindle.

460
00:28:52,542 --> 00:28:54,130
Scott: It can't be removed from the Kindle.

461
00:28:54,331 --> 00:28:55,117
Rym: Well, no, it's an account.

462
00:28:55,157 --> 00:29:06,649
Rym: like you can download it to another Kindle in and all that stuff, but You were reliant upon that DRM and you could you know at some point we're probably going to lose our access to these works.

463
00:29:07,951 --> 00:29:10,244
Scott: They did one thing they did that was nice.

464
00:29:10,364 --> 00:29:21,607
Scott: on the new Kindle is now It actually connects with USB and you can like send text files over and such Not PDF because PDFs need to be converted which is an understandable to convert PDFs.

465
00:29:21,627 --> 00:29:22,530
Rym: You can't just convert them.

466
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:30,790
Rym: You have to basically email them to Amazon and they convert them and then they email them back to you And then you put them on the Kindle or they email them to the Kindle.

467
00:29:30,951 --> 00:29:33,270
Rym: Oh Scott you email them back to you and you put them on.

468
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:33,854
Rym: I'm pretty sure.

469
00:29:33,874 --> 00:29:36,290
Scott: the I'm pretty sure they email them directly to the Kindle.

470
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:42,270
Rym: You've got to let me finish because I read all the articles and I know I read the thing on amazon.com.

471
00:29:42,431 --> 00:29:45,190
Scott: It says your kindle has an email address.

472
00:29:45,511 --> 00:29:49,382
Rym: Yes, you realize there are two ways to do this and they're important caveats to both.

473
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:50,124
Rym: Uh-huh.

474
00:29:50,164 --> 00:30:00,855
Rym: You either email it to Amazon they email it back to you and then you sync it to the Kindle for free over the USB or You email it to Amazon.

475
00:30:01,276 --> 00:30:06,170
Rym: They email it via the 3g to the Kindle and you pay ten cents.

476
00:30:06,735 --> 00:30:08,008
Scott: Oh, I didn't know you had to pay ten cents.

477
00:30:08,028 --> 00:30:10,780
Rym: Yes It says that straight up very clearly.

478
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,804
Rym: Uh-huh.

479
00:30:11,965 --> 00:30:16,717
Rym: These are two ways to go about it Uh-huh, but the part that bothers me is you have to email it to them.

480
00:30:16,757 --> 00:30:17,799
Rym: Why don't they just give me the?

481
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:18,421
Scott: why don't they?

482
00:30:23,051 --> 00:30:30,709
Rym: The official answer that it kind of makes sense is that it's still beta and because of the way PDFs are a Lot of PDFs just get totally fucked up.

483
00:30:30,891 --> 00:30:39,379
Rym: So by emailing them to them they kind of get to test the converter and continuously update it on their side without having to constantly update everyone else.

484
00:30:39,399 --> 00:30:44,950
Rym: and Theoretically someday they'll have a converter that works pretty reliably and then we'll get it.

485
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:48,910
Scott: The problem is it's only gonna work on a PDF that is predominantly text.

486
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:53,370
Scott: It's not gonna work on a PDF that has like you're like if I had a PDF of the mouse guard book.

487
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:54,398
Scott: That was all scans.

488
00:30:54,760 --> 00:31:02,090
Scott: you like the mouse guard RPG Even if the text was in time with all those pictures and shit, but I'm fine with that because it's just a text reader.

489
00:31:02,452 --> 00:31:06,509
Rym: It's clearly not an image or video or color or anything like that.

490
00:31:06,811 --> 00:31:12,030
Rym: But in the end we lose the right to first sale wide reaching societal implications.

491
00:31:12,272 --> 00:31:14,486
Scott: Like far the price is too high.

492
00:31:14,566 --> 00:31:19,436
Scott: the amount of money I'll save on the books isn't enough to make Like zero concern.

493
00:31:19,456 --> 00:31:20,379
Rym: Yeah, I can.

494
00:31:20,459 --> 00:31:23,650
Rym: I'm concerned with societal implications and personal use.

495
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:29,750
Scott: Yeah, anyway, and oh the one other thing that I don't like about the Kindle that it kind of bothers me, right?

496
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:33,760
Scott: It has his keyboard on it, which is you know, it's.

497
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,444
Scott: it's a fine keyboard, right?

498
00:31:35,545 --> 00:31:37,330
Scott: And the device is still pretty small.

499
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:40,928
Scott: but How much type am I gonna do on it?

500
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:47,610
Rym: Realize people who own Kindles now from what I see they just surf the web on it and like check their email.

501
00:31:47,751 --> 00:31:49,077
Rym: The thing is I have I found it.

502
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:51,690
Scott: Oh, I only want to use it for reading books.

503
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:53,097
Scott: I don't want to use it for any of that stuff.

504
00:31:53,117 --> 00:31:53,800
Scott: I have an iPhone.

505
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,770
Scott: That's way better as a color screen.

506
00:31:56,111 --> 00:31:58,519
Rym: Other people want they wanted enough, right?

507
00:31:58,539 --> 00:32:00,284
Rym: They're willing that they want it like that is a.

508
00:32:00,445 --> 00:32:02,070
Scott: that's fine for those people.

509
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,421
Scott: But for me, I don't want that.

510
00:32:04,481 --> 00:32:12,450
Scott: In fact, I specifically don't want that Something that doesn't have that keyboard in the way and is actually much smaller and just reads books.

511
00:32:12,691 --> 00:32:14,376
Rym: But Scott, you know, give me the Kindle Nano.

512
00:32:14,396 --> 00:32:15,199
Scott: You're forgetting the point.

513
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:18,430
Rym: You're probably never going to be the demographic for the Kindle.

514
00:32:18,832 --> 00:32:19,133
Scott: I mean.

515
00:32:19,214 --> 00:32:21,264
Scott: the thing is I really want to want one.

516
00:32:21,304 --> 00:32:24,578
Scott: I just did just I get caught up in the specifics.

517
00:32:24,618 --> 00:32:25,361
Scott: Just fuck it over.

518
00:32:25,742 --> 00:32:26,947
Rym: But the thing is the technology.

519
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:27,690
Rym: the Kindle is fine.

520
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:28,756
Rym: I'm okay with that screen.

521
00:32:28,776 --> 00:32:29,762
Rym: I'm okay with everything.

522
00:32:29,983 --> 00:32:31,150
Scott: Oh, yeah, I'm okay with the screen.

523
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:31,612
Rym: I'm even.

524
00:32:31,893 --> 00:32:55,416
Rym: I'm okay with the price to the point that if the DRM were not a concern or if Instead of this model because the reason why I'm okay with Netflix on demand or even Netflix in general but I'm not okay with this DRM or you know, the old iTunes DRM is that DRM that pretends you're buying something when an actuality you're renting it is BS DRM.

525
00:32:55,476 --> 00:32:56,281
Rym: that is straight up.

526
00:32:56,321 --> 00:32:57,769
Rym: you are renting it is fine.

527
00:32:58,452 --> 00:33:03,830
Rym: And if the Kindle here's if the Kindle cost the same it does now and I had to pay 20 bucks a month on top of.

528
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:12,230
Rym: But that 20 bucks a month got me access to Any ebook on Amazon like maybe 10 at a time for as long as I kept paying?

529
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:15,710
Rym: Like I wouldn't even can I would have already bought it.

530
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:20,070
Scott: There is one difference though that I do agree with that mostly about the renting.

531
00:33:20,171 --> 00:33:30,250
Scott: there's one difference though between renting of a physical medium and Renting of like a streaming thing, right and Netflix is okay because they still send you the physical thing if you want, right?

532
00:33:30,311 --> 00:33:31,420
Scott: But you can also get the streaming.

533
00:33:31,461 --> 00:33:32,881
Rym: I don't care about the physical thing Amazon.

534
00:33:35,854 --> 00:33:40,490
Scott: Well, the difference is right and this is this, you know, you might not care about it, right?

535
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:44,890
Scott: But I think it's very important is let's say Netflix is only streaming right, you know.

536
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:47,900
Scott: And you say compare it to Blockbuster where you rent DVDs, right?

537
00:33:48,382 --> 00:33:50,650
Scott: And let's say they were the same price, whatever, right?

538
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:51,776
Scott: Just get all those other things.

539
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:52,077
Scott: I don't know.

540
00:33:52,218 --> 00:33:54,250
Rym: I'm curious where you've got that thing.

541
00:33:54,712 --> 00:33:57,122
Scott: That will be a problem of everyone.

542
00:33:57,162 --> 00:34:06,170
Scott: switching to the streaming is now We can't like take those streamed Netflix's and make YouTube mashups or we can't you know remix them or any of that.

543
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:09,804
Rym: That's a good thing for the industry in the end.

544
00:34:09,824 --> 00:34:11,934
Scott: because look I don't care about the industry We're caring about us.

545
00:34:12,034 --> 00:34:12,817
Scott: We care about the industry.

546
00:34:12,837 --> 00:34:16,728
Rym: You should buy the Kindle Scott and for us, I mean, that's not a concern I mean your rights, right?

547
00:34:17,012 --> 00:34:18,730
Rym: You're renting the media just to watch it.

548
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:18,850
Rym: Like.

549
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:19,733
Rym: that's what you're paying for.

550
00:34:20,375 --> 00:34:27,704
Rym: if you want the actual media in an open format to deal with personally for you know Remixes or whatever just buy the DVD.

551
00:34:27,724 --> 00:34:28,650
Rym: they sell it in the store.

552
00:34:28,991 --> 00:34:30,014
Scott: Yeah, but they have to.

553
00:34:30,094 --> 00:34:35,034
Scott: you know, the thing is if I rent from Netflix on DVD I can do that You know with only renting.

554
00:34:35,135 --> 00:34:38,570
Rym: but that's just because they give you this extra thing that most people don't want.

555
00:34:39,072 --> 00:34:40,561
Scott: Yeah, but that's you know, I'm still.

556
00:34:40,581 --> 00:34:41,344
Scott: that needs to be.

557
00:34:41,364 --> 00:34:44,344
Scott: you know That's just because I can see.

558
00:34:44,364 --> 00:34:50,750
Scott: I you know If the streaming and it's not it access becomes the norm and ownership goes away.

559
00:34:50,991 --> 00:34:57,270
Scott: I mean you can't you know copy and paste from a from Amazon book and you I've never said that ownership will go away.

560
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:58,536
Rym: The thing is that it's.

561
00:34:58,556 --> 00:35:01,309
Scott: the thing is I can see ownership going away in favor of these.

562
00:35:01,491 --> 00:35:03,689
Scott: You know street just giving access.

563
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:09,368
Rym: But Scott ownership only goes away if the majority of people don't care about the rest of it and the majority people don't.

564
00:35:09,589 --> 00:35:10,734
Scott: I know That's a problem.

565
00:35:11,396 --> 00:35:14,750
Scott: It's it's a severe detriment to to art and creativity.

566
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:30,589
Rym: I don't think it's nearly that much of a detriment because even with the streaming people just hack it and I'm pretty sure that the ownership media will still be there because the the average people at least for the foreseeable generation of people They still like to own these things.

567
00:35:31,232 --> 00:35:40,702
Scott: Yeah, I don't know but if we start moving to lot to access and you know Ways to own things become incredibly expensive or impossible.

568
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:42,748
Scott: It's gonna be problematic.

569
00:35:42,788 --> 00:35:47,223
Rym: from that standpoint I think that is a much weaker concern than the much more pressing concern.

570
00:35:47,283 --> 00:35:49,150
Scott: I still think it is a very strong concern.

571
00:35:49,571 --> 00:35:49,953
Rym: I think it's.

572
00:35:50,495 --> 00:35:54,810
Rym: I think it's weaker because it's much deferred by the fact that culture changes much more slowly.

573
00:35:54,951 --> 00:35:59,781
Rym: I'm more concerned with DRM Rapidly removing our immediate first sale.

574
00:35:59,841 --> 00:36:01,068
Rym: right then I am with DRM.

575
00:36:01,633 --> 00:36:03,050
Scott: Yeah, I'm more concerned with that.

576
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:06,309
Scott: But I'm concerned about both and I don't want to give up either one.

577
00:36:06,751 --> 00:36:09,419
Rym: You're basically the concern that the rental model will destroy.

578
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:15,922
Rym: the buyers model has been a concern since blockbuster first existed And that is not panned out yet.

579
00:36:15,982 --> 00:36:26,843
Scott: Meanwhile DRM getting rid of first sale Yeah, but what's happening is renting is become is because is expanding and not just rental but into an Access to anything you want at any time.

580
00:36:26,883 --> 00:36:27,909
Scott: but access only.

581
00:36:28,592 --> 00:36:33,504
Rym: But but Scott everything that has that the physical media and the ownership has gone.

582
00:36:33,564 --> 00:36:41,835
Rym: Nowhere is still right there in a van Yeah, but I could you know, give me any example of something that became on-demand only Yeah in a few years.

583
00:36:41,855 --> 00:36:44,505
Rym: Do you really because so far there's zero examples?

584
00:36:44,826 --> 00:36:45,910
Scott: Yeah, it's not happen.

585
00:36:46,131 --> 00:36:48,001
Rym: But but there's no trend at all.

586
00:36:48,082 --> 00:36:49,449
Rym: It hasn't happened at all.

587
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:50,376
Scott: It's gonna have.

588
00:36:50,437 --> 00:36:53,594
Scott: DVD sales are going down the shitter Is going up.

589
00:36:53,915 --> 00:36:56,964
Rym: DVD sales are going down for a lot more reasons than that.

590
00:36:57,125 --> 00:36:58,850
Scott: I'm just saying, you know, it's it's coming.

591
00:37:00,091 --> 00:37:01,617
Rym: But Scott, like I said, it's coming.

592
00:37:01,778 --> 00:37:04,570
Scott: We got so we were gonna wait until it happens and then worry about it.

593
00:37:04,951 --> 00:37:06,738
Rym: No, I'm saying that you have to prioritize.

594
00:37:06,899 --> 00:37:07,822
Rym: No, nothing is.

595
00:37:08,003 --> 00:37:09,027
Scott: I'm saying both we can.

596
00:37:09,047 --> 00:37:09,870
Scott: why can't we do both?

597
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:11,549
Scott: Why do we have to stick with just one Scott?

598
00:37:12,931 --> 00:37:16,724
Rym: In the world no priority is ever equal to another priority.

599
00:37:16,924 --> 00:37:18,710
Rym: there is always a point of decision.

600
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:23,449
Scott: So therefore there is always a matrix of my point of decision after both of those.

601
00:37:24,419 --> 00:37:32,436
Rym: Okay All I'm saying is that I think it's a much less immediate concern than the loss of first sale because is a less of a concern But it is still a great concern.

602
00:37:32,476 --> 00:37:34,323
Scott: The other one is a greater concern.

603
00:37:34,584 --> 00:37:36,310
Scott: Okay, I'm both great concerns.

604
00:37:36,651 --> 00:37:40,928
Rym: I still feel that the loss to first sale is a much greater and more immediate concern.

605
00:37:41,068 --> 00:37:41,550
Scott: That's fine.

606
00:37:41,691 --> 00:37:43,924
Scott: That doesn't mean the other one is not a great concern.

607
00:37:43,965 --> 00:37:45,532
Scott: That is also great I don't.

608
00:37:45,753 --> 00:37:49,728
Rym: I think it's a concern that can be deferred for at least five years if not a decade.

609
00:37:49,888 --> 00:37:58,190
Rym: not even Okay, but the thing is we already have evidence of DRM and first sale like being taken away by downloadable content.

610
00:37:59,033 --> 00:38:03,630
Rym: There is already zero precedent for losing access to original ownable media.

611
00:38:11,425 --> 00:38:19,449
Rym: but anyway things of the day, uh I found this a long time ago and I ignored it because it looked like one of those really dumb things like this.

612
00:38:19,509 --> 00:38:23,564
Rym: looked like The kind of video that wouldn't even be worth clicking on in one night.

613
00:38:23,825 --> 00:38:25,050
Rym: I'm sitting around with Emily and Scott.

614
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,234
Rym: You know, we got the computer open.

615
00:38:26,675 --> 00:38:29,383
Rym: We're looking at funny internet videos in my room.

616
00:38:29,423 --> 00:38:33,476
Rym: Just you know, hang it like you do and We've run out as we do there.

617
00:38:33,496 --> 00:38:37,269
Rym: There aren't that many worthwhile things on the internet anymore.

618
00:38:38,391 --> 00:38:42,067
Rym: Kind of it's hard to find something that's so novel or so new in.

619
00:38:43,373 --> 00:38:46,858
Scott: Actually good That is also quick and new.

620
00:38:47,681 --> 00:38:49,086
Rym: I mean, alright some guy getting in the nuts.

621
00:38:49,126 --> 00:38:50,110
Rym: I've seen a hundred videos.

622
00:38:50,512 --> 00:38:51,355
Rym: What do you have new?

623
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:52,921
Rym: does it get hit in the nuts twice?

624
00:38:52,961 --> 00:38:54,306
Rym: I've seen that three times.

625
00:38:54,386 --> 00:38:56,838
Scott: seen that I We're so jaded.

626
00:38:56,878 --> 00:38:58,410
Scott: We need to see something new and amazing.

627
00:38:58,731 --> 00:39:03,670
Rym: So we run out and I do the thing that always happens where I click on like one last video.

628
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:18,742
Rym: it's like I'm going to bed after this and I click on this video of the counts from Sesame Street, you know batty batty batty One of my favorite Sesame Street's if not my number one favorite.

629
00:39:18,862 --> 00:39:19,906
Rym: now all this video does.

630
00:39:19,926 --> 00:39:29,890
Rym: is it a run for it with the Cookie Monster is censor out one and Exactly one word the word count and it is just bleeped out.

631
00:39:29,971 --> 00:39:30,615
Rym: That is all they do.

632
00:39:30,635 --> 00:39:32,850
Rym: is they bleep out the word count for this entire song.

633
00:39:33,191 --> 00:39:41,228
Scott: Well, actually they don't bleep it out when he's referring to himself by name saying I am the count But they bleep it out whenever he uses it in any of its other meaning.

634
00:39:41,268 --> 00:39:46,124
Rym: Yes So basically they bleep out the verb but not the proper noun exactly.

635
00:39:46,786 --> 00:39:52,390
Rym: The end result is Funnier than you would have I think expected.

636
00:39:52,611 --> 00:39:56,990
Scott: I think they did it on purpose back then the Sesame Street makers Jim Henson and whatnot.

637
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:58,175
Scott: I think they did it on purpose.

638
00:39:58,597 --> 00:40:09,796
Rym: I wouldn't be surprised because you listen to this and It goes beyond you know, like Pink Floyd matching up with Lord or not Lord of the Rings Though someone did that too to prove that is BS.

639
00:40:10,057 --> 00:40:44,310
Scott: Yeah, but it goes beyond Pink Floyd matching up with something and goes into like Because I really love Sometimes I sit and all day But sometimes I get carried away.

640
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:51,746
Rym: Hi slowly slowly slowly getting faster.

641
00:40:52,208 --> 00:40:59,948
Scott: once I start It's very hard to stop Faster faster, it is so exciting.

642
00:41:00,068 --> 00:41:35,919
Scott: I could One two three four one two three four one two three four one two One two three four One two three four one two, that's a song of the count Like the spiders on the wall Like the cobwebs in the hall The candles on the shelf.

643
00:41:41,652 --> 00:41:50,408
Rym: I That's what I got Scott.

644
00:41:50,771 --> 00:41:55,710
Rym: It's funny like every time Scott was gonna try to steal this from me and do it on Thursday because it was so good.

645
00:41:55,791 --> 00:41:56,799
Rym: So I had to preempt him.

646
00:41:56,819 --> 00:41:58,029
Scott: No, what could I do?

647
00:41:58,311 --> 00:42:00,159
Scott: I can't I can't steal I stolen.

648
00:42:00,199 --> 00:42:04,749
Scott: like every good thing in the day whenever there's a battle over it He has and so I have to let one go.

649
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:09,309
Rym: I have lost at least five or six good things of the day and to my power of dibs.

650
00:42:11,131 --> 00:42:17,110
Scott: So back when I was in RIT and in times before right, you know, you go to a college.

651
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:18,875
Scott: You have these old computer science teachers.

652
00:42:18,895 --> 00:42:29,485
Scott: They've been teaching computer science like forever since before, you know modern computers And there's always this one Computer that's always sort of mentioned, you know as like.

653
00:42:29,606 --> 00:42:34,108
Scott: ah back in the day We used this machine and the machine is the pdp-11.

654
00:42:35,432 --> 00:42:42,370
Scott: It's sort of a really famous old computer that you know sort of a generation or two of computer scientists before me.

655
00:42:43,012 --> 00:42:49,357
Scott: That's what they use, you know people in the 80s and such Pdp-11s were what they learned to program on.

656
00:42:49,397 --> 00:42:50,500
Scott: that was the mainframe.

657
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:50,981
Scott: that was.

658
00:42:51,382 --> 00:42:56,417
Scott: you know what all the sort of you know jobs Wozniak gates type people.

659
00:42:56,457 --> 00:42:58,785
Scott: if they went to college, you know, it didn't drop out.

660
00:42:58,865 --> 00:43:00,390
Scott: That's what was there, right?

661
00:43:00,792 --> 00:43:01,394
Rym: It's one of those.

662
00:43:01,494 --> 00:43:05,852
Rym: if you don't even know anything about computers, you'll just you'll hear that now It's a.

663
00:43:05,932 --> 00:43:09,104
Scott: it's a historic famous computer the pdp-11, right?

664
00:43:09,124 --> 00:43:09,927
Scott: There's also a pdp-10.

665
00:43:12,692 --> 00:43:24,210
Scott: This is a pdp-11 simulator and as a guy He's got this whole how-to and a whole bunch of tutorials and you can learn to program the pdp-11 which I Think is pretty awesome.

666
00:43:24,291 --> 00:43:30,648
Scott: If you got some free time You can learn the real deal computer science just like you're a computer science student in the 80s.

667
00:43:31,452 --> 00:43:34,167
Rym: This is one of those things where if you want think of something

668
00:43:34,228 --> 00:43:35,514
Scott: or the same I don't know what you're just

669
00:43:35,535 --> 00:43:43,284
Rym: thinking something cool and simple and try to do it here and You'll learn a lot more than you might from just taking Python writing if you

670
00:43:43,324 --> 00:43:44,950
Scott: can if you can make this happen.

671
00:43:45,231 --> 00:43:53,395
Scott: This is only for people who really really want to be programmers not for people who just want to learn some programming To do normal everyday stuff.

672
00:43:53,676 --> 00:43:55,121
Scott: This is something only computer science.

673
00:43:55,141 --> 00:43:59,939
Scott: people really need to know but it is You know, you'll learn a fuck ton.

674
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:03,570
Scott: if you can understand what this shit is going on You will be a master.

675
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:19,460
Rym: so we're not really gonna talk about the direct news of this because the news is you know, Google has this cool thing, but there are a lot of issues related to this and we have to explore at least the beginning of this because It's a topic that I've been thinking about ever since.

676
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:27,044
Rym: a long time ago when Penn Jillette of all people brought it up He posited on his old, you know, Penn Radio this hey, wouldn't it be cool?

677
00:44:27,184 --> 00:44:29,029
Rym: if oh, but what if the government's?

678
00:44:30,671 --> 00:44:40,250
Rym: And I remember back then thinking Like I immediately I thought of like a hundred cool things I could do with it And then I thought of a thousand bad things other people could do with it.

679
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:59,317
Scott: So basically just to sum up the news Google has a thing called latitude And basically what they do is if you have a phone or some sort of GPS device It will you basically let Google know where you are as you move around town and then it will update a Google map and People can see you on it, you know But only people you allow.

680
00:44:59,357 --> 00:45:02,610
Scott: so like I would let Rym follow me and then Rym could know where I was.

681
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:07,162
Scott: So let's say I was coming to meet him at I don't know the train station.

682
00:45:07,644 --> 00:45:09,388
Scott: He could see aha Scott's on 27th Street.

683
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:13,084
Scott: He's a little far away, but I'm not gonna lies around the corner.

684
00:45:13,406 --> 00:45:19,401
Rym: I'm not gonna let Petto bear 978 at AOL see where I'm going.

685
00:45:19,682 --> 00:45:21,589
Scott: Well, you're not to let him see where your little kids ago.

686
00:45:21,811 --> 00:45:23,250
Rym: No, I'm not gonna see where I'm going.

687
00:45:23,551 --> 00:45:38,608
Scott: Alright, and the fundamental problem here is on the one hand you want to take information about yourself Record it digitize it and share it with people you trust because that is incredibly useful right.

688
00:45:38,628 --> 00:45:41,670
Rym: secondarily Analyze it for your own purposes.

689
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:53,575
Rym: I mean imagine if every day you could go home and look at a heat map of like where you went every day and like what watch your walking paths and where you slow down and where you sped up and the Work and all

690
00:45:53,595 --> 00:45:58,010
Scott: this data about you is useful in a million ways and you know.

691
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:09,069
Scott: In fact, it's even good to share some of it depending on what data it is with the entire world because I mean like, you know Maybe I only want the people I trust to know where I am right now.

692
00:46:09,632 --> 00:46:36,630
Scott: But I might trust the whole world to know what book I bought and that's totally useful to like, you know listeners whoever what you know, they want to know what books I bought and it's it's helpful to them if they think I'm a good judge Of taste and such, you know The problem is is any information you release about yourself can also be used for nefarious purposes and specifically location data is some of the most sensitive because it can be used for stocking.

693
00:46:38,071 --> 00:46:41,870
Scott: Now and if you're a hot lady that is doubly troublesome.

694
00:46:43,032 --> 00:46:54,090
Scott: Or if you're an internet person in general, I mean or any sort of famous person like even if you're like You know a mayor or a senator or you know anything not even famous because famous is too broad a term.

695
00:46:54,090 --> 00:47:01,810
Rym: But I would say have brought the attention in famous Have brought attention to yourself on any level.

696
00:47:01,890 --> 00:47:09,955
Rym: I mean anyone whose name is mentioned on the internet in places where a lot of people go is immediately Subject to it.

697
00:47:09,995 --> 00:47:11,910
Scott: could even it could even be local fame.

698
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:18,070
Scott: I mean if you're just like the popular girl in school or the really unpopular person at school.

699
00:47:18,371 --> 00:47:29,210
Scott: Or maybe you have like a book club, but like they don't like you or you know or some anything even a small group You know, it could be anyone in that group, you know if you got troubles.

700
00:47:30,155 --> 00:47:32,749
Rym: So, let's talk first about the fun side of this.

701
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:34,898
Rym: Pretend for a moment.

702
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:36,709
Rym: We're in a magical world where?

703
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:42,810
Rym: Every possible negative concern has been magically addressed by the Flying Spaghetti Monster.

704
00:47:43,852 --> 00:47:47,206
Scott: So if only that could happen, please Flying Spaghetti Monster save us.

705
00:47:47,346 --> 00:47:53,389
Rym: There is a God He's made of ramen because because you posture farians can burn in the everlasting pasta hell.

706
00:47:56,192 --> 00:48:00,300
Rym: I Sorry, so there are no privacy concerns whatsoever.

707
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,463
Scott: worship the kitchen era.

708
00:48:02,105 --> 00:48:03,569
Rym: the government never looks at it.

709
00:48:04,836 --> 00:48:06,890
Rym: What are the cool things we could do like this here?

710
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:10,748
Rym: This is the kind of the we could optimize walking paths.

711
00:48:10,768 --> 00:48:17,351
Rym: one this is kind of the fantasy baseball side of man wouldn't be cool if I could do X Y & Z and Two.

712
00:48:17,874 --> 00:48:21,390
Rym: this is why geeks like us are so excited about the possibilities.

713
00:48:21,511 --> 00:48:30,426
Rym: I mean if there weren't cool possibilities like this Like if you could only do a few cool things with it Then the privacy concerns would far outweigh to the point that we wouldn't even bother.

714
00:48:30,466 --> 00:48:33,041
Rym: but example Hanging out with the front row crew.

715
00:48:33,283 --> 00:48:42,777
Rym: one of the biggest thing problems we have is on a weekend where we're all hanging out like we're all gonna play some burning wheel or some mouse guard or something and No one really says when they're gonna show up.

716
00:48:42,817 --> 00:48:44,644
Rym: or like someone gets delayed and we're sitting around.

717
00:48:44,684 --> 00:48:46,470
Rym: It's like noon on Saturday.

718
00:48:46,611 --> 00:48:49,644
Rym: We're wondering who's showing up when we're trying to like call people.

719
00:48:49,925 --> 00:48:50,850
Rym: Hey, did you leave yet?

720
00:48:51,171 --> 00:48:53,459
Rym: Well, I just saw Pete posted something in the forum.

721
00:48:53,499 --> 00:48:56,269
Rym: So he's probably still in the Albany and blah blah blah.

722
00:48:57,132 --> 00:49:03,070
Rym: What if I could just go to the heat map or the Google map and I see a dot for everyone?

723
00:49:03,271 --> 00:49:04,275
Rym: I know dude.

724
00:49:04,355 --> 00:49:06,162
Scott: I just had a. that gave me a greatest idea.

725
00:49:06,564 --> 00:49:08,150
Scott: You could use these with a road rally.

726
00:49:08,813 --> 00:49:10,279
Scott: Oh my god, you would know.

727
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:12,590
Scott: like if you know, you could just see where everyone is.

728
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:27,950
Scott: So even though you say you could do any kind either rally you could do you know The long-distance sort of rally with the checkpoints or you could do the actual downhill rally Right where you just see the cars go around the turn you're standing at, you know But you can see who's winning there.

729
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:36,965
Scott: You know how fast he's going down the mountain by looking at your little Google map or even the annual you know GeekNights road rally raced from Baltimore to Wildwood.

730
00:49:37,166 --> 00:49:38,330
Scott: Yes, something like that, right?

731
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:43,569
Scott: You could you know and if the GPS is precise enough you could like if we're at Otakon, huh?

732
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:45,096
Scott: Where I wonder where Pete is.

733
00:49:45,116 --> 00:49:46,301
Scott: Oh, he's in the dealer's room.

734
00:49:46,321 --> 00:49:48,130
Scott: Oh, I wonder where a Rym is.

735
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:51,845
Scott: Oh, he's at the artist alley table, you know you or like.

736
00:49:51,886 --> 00:49:52,890
Scott: hey, I'll meet you someone.

737
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,114
Scott: So let's meet in the middle.

738
00:49:54,194 --> 00:50:02,154
Scott: So you're walking towards someone and sometimes you know, you're trying to meet someone in the middle You'll pass each other not seeing each other in a crowd This way.

739
00:50:02,194 --> 00:50:03,379
Scott: that can't possibly happen.

740
00:50:03,701 --> 00:50:10,008
Rym: that happened Emily and I. once next to Brian Park We were trying to meet and we were walking toward each other on the same side of the street on 42nd Street.

741
00:50:10,912 --> 00:50:12,826
Rym: We passed each other three times.

742
00:50:13,108 --> 00:50:16,180
Scott: Wow Yeah, I mean, you know one step further.

743
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:18,590
Scott: I think about New York Comic Con yesterday, right?

744
00:50:18,953 --> 00:50:26,225
Scott: We sort of you know We tried not to split up and such we could have split up and then found each other like nothing without even picking a meeting spot.

745
00:50:26,245 --> 00:50:33,609
Rym: go one step further and do the Outlook thing where there's a function where you can tell outlook to schedule a meeting when five people are free.

746
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:35,177
Rym: You're right now.

747
00:50:35,478 --> 00:50:37,709
Rym: combine this with Twitter or something like it.

748
00:50:38,512 --> 00:50:43,574
Rym: I hit the need to meet up button with my defined group of people I need to meet up with.

749
00:50:44,117 --> 00:50:45,684
Rym: it pings everyone.

750
00:50:45,725 --> 00:50:55,399
Rym: I want to meet up with Immediately and says Rym wants to meet up and it calculates a meet-up space based on who all accepts the meet-up.

751
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:59,756
Rym: that is the optimal location for all the people who agreed to Distance wise.

752
00:50:59,816 --> 00:51:01,545
Scott: so everyone has the shortest walk to meet us.

753
00:51:01,605 --> 00:51:07,650
Rym: Yes Yes, or you define like ten meeting places like the bar downtown.

754
00:51:07,811 --> 00:51:10,018
Rym: We hang out at the bar uptown.

755
00:51:10,058 --> 00:51:12,567
Rym: we hang out at the bar cross town like.

756
00:51:12,587 --> 00:51:13,430
Scott: how about this?

757
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:14,916
Scott: We're in a giant dealer's room, right?

758
00:51:14,976 --> 00:51:16,322
Scott: It's wicked crowded, right?

759
00:51:16,443 --> 00:51:23,350
Scott: I see something way awesome Right, so I just go and I type let's say I see I don't know what'd be really awesome.

760
00:51:24,454 --> 00:51:29,344
Rym: You see a hot today Miku Holograph generator that will act out and sing the site.

761
00:51:29,384 --> 00:51:30,830
Scott: So I see Hatsune Miku, right?

762
00:51:31,151 --> 00:51:34,588
Scott: I take a little video of the Hatsune Miku with my phone and then there's.

763
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:41,110
Scott: It sends it out to all my friends who are also at the con and they know exactly where that video was.

764
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:45,930
Scott: They can see it right then and they can see where I am when I was taking the whole thing.

765
00:51:45,950 --> 00:51:52,884
Scott: So then if they want to see the Hatsune Miku, they can go right there During the con or alright, I'm skiing me and Scott Johnson.

766
00:51:52,904 --> 00:51:54,390
Rym: We you know, we go skiing together that way.

767
00:51:54,490 --> 00:51:57,904
Scott: You know if we get like I'll be like, oh, where was that Hatsune Miku?

768
00:51:57,944 --> 00:51:59,370
Scott: I forget we're in the dealer's room.

769
00:51:59,471 --> 00:52:00,597
Scott: It was oh shit.

770
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:01,382
Scott: We lost it.

771
00:52:01,764 --> 00:52:02,770
Scott: Uh, that won't happen.

772
00:52:03,011 --> 00:52:08,429
Rym: But one of the problems I often had was that all right I'm at the bottom of the hill or you know, he's waiting at the bottom of the hill.

773
00:52:09,552 --> 00:52:10,175
Rym: How do I like?

774
00:52:10,195 --> 00:52:10,920
Rym: how long do I wait?

775
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,650
Rym: do I just go back up and ski down again?

776
00:52:12,850 --> 00:52:18,312
Rym: Like maybe I can just look on the GPS on my iPhone and be like, oh he's going down way out All right.

777
00:52:18,352 --> 00:52:22,490
Rym: Well, I'll go up and I'll ski down the backcountry trail and I'll meet him at the bottom of the z-lift.

778
00:52:22,711 --> 00:52:23,936
Scott: Oh, we're in the grocery store.

779
00:52:24,017 --> 00:52:25,564
Scott: I'm already done with all my groceries.

780
00:52:25,624 --> 00:52:26,910
Scott: Where's Rym in the grocery store?

781
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:28,838
Scott: Do I have to run back and forth down every aisle?

782
00:52:28,918 --> 00:52:31,710
Scott: Maybe he checked out already and is outside at the car waiting.

783
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:32,867
Scott: I'll just know.

784
00:52:34,153 --> 00:52:34,797
Rym: Or even you know.

785
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:40,782
Rym: privacy concerns aside, obviously The police can find me when I want them to find me.

786
00:52:41,224 --> 00:52:44,496
Scott: Yeah, I mean, oh no So I broke my leg in the woods.

787
00:52:44,838 --> 00:52:45,881
Rym: help help.

788
00:52:46,002 --> 00:52:46,945
Scott: I am right here help.

789
00:52:47,045 --> 00:52:47,507
Scott: Oh god.

790
00:52:47,708 --> 00:52:58,665
Rym: or even better I can see like the rescuers are coming after me can ping and so I can see where they are in the woods and they Can see where I am so we can move toward each other instead of the.

791
00:52:58,746 --> 00:53:06,417
Rym: if you can move Yeah, but if I can as opposed to the old standby of when in doubt you have to wait because you don't know where the Rescuers are or actually you.

792
00:53:06,437 --> 00:53:09,930
Scott: just you know, I mean regular GPS can do this already, right?

793
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:17,721
Scott: But you know, you could let your kids just got into the woods and then know where they are and then go get them Yeah, or you know, you're a parent.

794
00:53:18,084 --> 00:53:19,272
Rym: if your kids agree to it You can.

795
00:53:19,292 --> 00:53:21,505
Rym: just you can see where your kids are all the time.

796
00:53:21,867 --> 00:53:25,016
Rym: Yeah And I can think of like like.

797
00:53:25,177 --> 00:53:30,155
Scott: I can think of so many things that you don't need to call and embarrass them while they're Friends basement or whatever.

798
00:53:30,336 --> 00:53:38,007
Rym: there are things I could do with this sort of technology the being able to share location data with friends in real time in real time.

799
00:53:38,047 --> 00:53:39,233
Rym: that would Revolution.

800
00:53:39,253 --> 00:53:42,870
Scott: the real time is what gives it an advantage over just like buying a GPS in your car.

801
00:53:43,171 --> 00:53:50,930
Rym: But it would I could revolutionize my life and resolute revolutionize my social interactions to an unprecedented degree.

802
00:53:51,252 --> 00:53:55,710
Rym: Mm-hmm Of course, it's not a fantasy world.

803
00:53:55,995 --> 00:54:02,850
Rym: You really want Governments that you may or may not agree with being able to track semi secretly all their citizens all the time.

804
00:54:03,072 --> 00:54:05,209
Rym: Do you want your boss to be able to see?

805
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:09,469
Rym: That you took an hour and ten minutes for lunch because you went all the way across town to a bar?

806
00:54:10,032 --> 00:54:14,150
Scott: Do you want you know your boss to see that you went to like the porn shop?

807
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:17,630
Rym: Do you trust Google to know where you are?

808
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:21,503
Rym: Yeah, Google already knows everything else about you.

809
00:54:21,523 --> 00:54:23,190
Rym: Do you want them to know where you are all the time?

810
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:33,130
Scott: I mean we trust Google now and basically I figure trust is something better where you put your all your eggs in one basket because When you're trusting your data, right?

811
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:39,697
Scott: I mean if I trust it all to Facebook and Google then it's sort of like there's a two Chances of me getting fucked this way.

812
00:54:39,757 --> 00:54:44,151
Scott: the only chance of me getting fuck because you're completely fucked if one of them goes away Right.

813
00:54:44,393 --> 00:54:46,080
Scott: So the fewer the better right.

814
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:47,326
Scott: does that make sense?

815
00:54:47,828 --> 00:54:49,596
Scott: It does Yeah, so I figure out.

816
00:54:49,616 --> 00:54:52,850
Scott: trust Google because they have been proven the most trustworthy.

817
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:55,097
Scott: They're not gonna stay trustworthy forever.

818
00:54:55,137 --> 00:55:07,127
Rym: probably the only reason I trust Google now is a very calculated game theory as Basically what my benefit of trusting them far outweighs the damage?

819
00:55:07,690 --> 00:55:16,015
Rym: No My logic is thus if Google turns evil the odds of them turning evil against me in Particular are very low.

820
00:55:16,195 --> 00:55:19,163
Scott: I also the one thing another reason I want to trust Google.

821
00:55:19,745 --> 00:55:22,112
Scott: if Google decides to fuck everyone They're also.

822
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:23,236
Scott: they're probably gonna fuck everyone.

823
00:55:23,256 --> 00:55:24,963
Scott: They're not gonna fuck just me, right?

824
00:55:25,143 --> 00:55:26,007
Scott: They're gonna fuck everyone.

825
00:55:26,027 --> 00:55:29,780
Scott: at the same time There'll be a very giant lawsuit happening.

826
00:55:30,021 --> 00:55:31,085
Rym: No, I don't forget lawsuit.

827
00:55:31,105 --> 00:55:32,590
Rym: You got to think on the Mad Max scale.

828
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:33,720
Rym: You've got to think in absolutes.

829
00:55:34,306 --> 00:55:37,680
Scott: Yeah Yeah, it'll be Mad Max when Google fucks everyone.

830
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:43,175
Rym: it might be right but no In in a board game.

831
00:55:43,195 --> 00:55:44,359
Scott: I have to search on Google for.

832
00:55:44,379 --> 00:55:48,877
Rym: look in a board game if There are option.

833
00:55:48,897 --> 00:55:51,350
Rym: you have nuclear options you have brinksmanship and all these things.

834
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:56,750
Rym: But you don't just weigh how much an individual decision helps or hurts you.

835
00:55:57,452 --> 00:56:02,530
Rym: You also weigh how much it helps or hurts or has the potential to help and hurt other people.

836
00:56:02,791 --> 00:56:08,874
Rym: You may or may not be competing with and if a decision hurts everyone equally.

837
00:56:09,556 --> 00:56:22,483
Rym: as in you know, there are 10 people playing the game if we all Choose to accept the help from the mysterious power and then at the end of the game we flip over the mysterious power card and it says minus 10 points.

838
00:56:23,169 --> 00:56:27,256
Rym: if Everyone chose to trust the card Everyone loses the same.

839
00:56:27,276 --> 00:56:31,590
Rym: I am no better or worse off because alright Google knows all my secrets.

840
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:37,839
Scott: You're no better worse off relative to the other people who are also on Google But you're still worse off compared to people weren't on Google.

841
00:56:37,859 --> 00:56:46,810
Rym: But this is the thing the almost everyone who is Functional in the modern world Basically is trusting Google to a large degree.

842
00:56:47,011 --> 00:56:50,545
Scott: So basically you're just betting along with everyone else like a game of craps.

843
00:56:50,646 --> 00:56:51,670
Scott: Everyone's betting to win.

844
00:56:52,071 --> 00:56:59,735
Rym: You know, it's that the more Google decides to be evil the more the wider their damage is the less damage They're doing individually.

845
00:56:59,755 --> 00:57:03,959
Rym: because alright, they know everything about me They know everything about everyone.

846
00:57:04,502 --> 00:57:24,306
Rym: if they go after everyone The what they can do to me compared to what they can do to everyone else Becomes a drop in the bucket because the information they have on me becomes more and more like an unto noise if they try to Break into everyone's bank accounts at the same time and steal everyone's money The the response from the world is violent.

847
00:57:24,326 --> 00:57:28,990
Scott: Yeah Alright, so forget about Google being evil for a second.

848
00:57:29,151 --> 00:57:34,110
Scott: What if you know other people are being evil, you know someone who looks and sees where I am is a stalker.

849
00:57:34,431 --> 00:57:38,306
Scott: They're going to stab me and great me this great.

850
00:57:38,808 --> 00:57:46,830
Rym: Yes grape This sucks because our IT there was a big problem with the IT and CS labs and that people needed to use them.

851
00:57:47,637 --> 00:57:48,829
Rym: They weren't open all the time.

852
00:57:49,211 --> 00:57:58,610
Rym: there wasn't enough space in the labs for everyone who needed them to use them at the same time and The you know pretty much on the weekends, you know, you couldn't sign up for lab time.

853
00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:04,130
Rym: It was like first come first serve and they were debating all these different ways to make it work better.

854
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:09,090
Rym: Like maybe you can reserve time or maybe you can look and see you know, if the labs free and then reserve a spot.

855
00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:19,855
Rym: but the reason they didn't implement a lot of these things the primary reason was that stalking was a big problem on our IT's campus like Stalkers were not that uncommon.

856
00:58:19,875 --> 00:58:24,550
Scott: In fact, I mean I've heard of a couple but I didn't think it was a big problem.

857
00:58:24,611 --> 00:58:25,430
Rym: It was a big enough.

858
00:58:25,450 --> 00:58:30,110
Scott: I mean, I heard of a few that it was a problem definitely, you know with some of the scary nerd types.

859
00:58:30,432 --> 00:58:32,143
Scott: But I didn't think it was like oh my god.

860
00:58:32,184 --> 00:58:33,090
Scott: It's all over the place.

861
00:58:33,230 --> 00:58:33,371
Scott: no,

862
00:58:33,431 --> 00:58:51,750
Rym: it was a big enough problem to where it was a concern a specific concern here in that if they set up a System where you could check into a lab and then you could look at the computer, you know in real time and see If there is a spot in the lab, like I could see there are two tables free in the sysadmin lab.

863
00:58:52,051 --> 00:58:53,716
Rym: I'm gonna reserve one and head over there.

864
00:58:53,836 --> 00:58:54,378
Rym: Oh my god.

865
00:58:54,398 --> 00:59:05,104
Rym: Mm-hmm creepy people can look and say alright, it's 11 o'clock There's only one person using the lab right now Someone is alone in the IT building.

866
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:10,530
Rym: Mm-hmm And that was enough of a concern to veto several of these cool options.

867
00:59:11,691 --> 00:59:12,774
Rym: It's not just our IT.

868
00:59:12,834 --> 00:59:39,318
Rym: stalking and I've read some reports on this when I worked in a capacity to see the academic papers being written by professors or that were being funded by grants and studies on students and everything and stalking a low-level Non-violent stalking or low-level stalking that causes non-deadly or non-violent but still important concerns is a growing and huge problem on college campuses because Kids be creepy.

869
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:40,223
Rym: internet-leds.

870
00:59:40,283 --> 00:59:43,864
Scott: creepy kids, especially Especially nerdy kids be creepy.

871
00:59:44,347 --> 00:59:52,667
Rym: Yes We're not talking about geeky kids thing about nerdy kids And I don't know what to do about this because every time we enable to I mean even get them all girlfriends.

872
00:59:53,209 --> 00:59:55,987
Rym: Yeah It's our boyfriends.

873
00:59:56,892 --> 01:00:02,304
Rym: Even if we secure this technology like alright only your friends can access this.

874
01:00:03,367 --> 01:00:06,869
Rym: if the system gets compromised Someone can access your data now you're fucked.

875
01:00:08,172 --> 01:00:08,918
Scott: Yeah, it's true.

876
01:00:09,241 --> 01:00:10,149
Rym: So what do we do about that?

877
01:00:10,470 --> 01:00:15,750
Scott: Yeah, I mean look even with the Google system, right you choose who can follow you and who can't and all that stuff, right?

878
01:00:16,470 --> 01:00:21,670
Scott: But someone could like maybe they could hack into Google or maybe what if someone like takes rims phone now?

879
01:00:21,730 --> 01:00:25,630
Scott: They know where I am, you know It's a. it's a rough situation.

880
01:00:26,292 --> 01:00:39,970
Rym: The problem is the first half of this was pretty much I could revolutionize my life in a way that would be far-reaching and like Difficult to determine the end result but definitely positive in manifold ways.

881
01:00:40,832 --> 01:00:47,550
Rym: But when it comes to the caveats and problem side, I have nothing but concerns and zero answers.

882
01:00:47,953 --> 01:00:48,537
Scott: Yeah, I know right.

883
01:00:48,558 --> 01:00:49,909
Scott: It's like what can we do about this?

884
01:00:52,311 --> 01:00:58,130
Scott: It's just we just do a risk-benefit analysis for each thing and put as many safeguards in as we can.

885
01:00:58,250 --> 01:01:06,550
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I guess we could like require a password every time but then that Reduces a lot of the utility as any security reduces utility.

886
01:01:06,570 --> 01:01:13,162
Scott: I mean think about it putting a lock on your front door doesn't seem like a big deal It does it me you have yet to.

887
01:01:13,182 --> 01:01:19,729
Scott: now every time you want to go in your house You have to have a thing turn an extra knob, you know, it's like extra work.

888
01:01:20,152 --> 01:01:21,785
Scott: Right, you want to have a fence around your house.

889
01:01:21,845 --> 01:01:22,450
Scott: It's extra work.

890
01:01:22,510 --> 01:01:23,594
Scott: You have to open this fence.

891
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:28,230
Scott: every piece of security that I have ever seen adds extra effort.

892
01:01:28,371 --> 01:01:29,335
Scott: You know a password.

893
01:01:29,938 --> 01:01:31,626
Scott: I have to actually type in a password.

894
01:01:31,646 --> 01:01:32,469
Scott: you have to do more work.

895
01:01:32,971 --> 01:01:34,997
Scott: So I need to have a security.

896
01:01:35,037 --> 01:01:42,278
Scott: you put on this adds extra work and in something like location data Where like, you know, it changes constantly.

897
01:01:42,298 --> 01:01:52,317
Scott: that few seconds of typing in a password or doing something like that Really decreases the utility very very significantly Compared to the security that it provides.

898
01:01:52,618 --> 01:02:01,410
Scott: to the point at which it's sort of like putting 20 locks on your front door It's like well fuck this isn't even worth it at this point, you know better off not having a door

899
01:02:02,013 --> 01:02:18,770
Rym: I guess for me personally, I am because I'm generally Confident and capable and I feel as though I can deal with the majority of situations I would be put into and I'm generally not risk-averse and I am generally unafraid of well just about anything.

900
01:02:18,850 --> 01:02:23,133
Scott: Yeah, if any if any cute girls want to stalk me That would be welcome.

901
01:02:23,775 --> 01:02:26,262
Scott: I as long as you're not the scary knife stalker.

902
01:02:26,282 --> 01:02:27,265
Scott: That is not cool.

903
01:02:27,305 --> 01:02:27,766
Scott: Stay away.

904
01:02:27,907 --> 01:02:39,790
Rym: I would be kind of okay, like to the point that I might just be willing to If I had a GPS device publish my location data almost all the time and just see what happens.

905
01:02:40,392 --> 01:02:51,250
Scott: My problem with it would be not so much that I care about my location data It's that there it wouldn't be useful to me unless my friends also did it, you know, it's like unless everyone does it.

906
01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:52,154
Scott: What's the point right?

907
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:55,550
Scott: It's like let's say we use it to arrange meetings at Otakon, right?

908
01:02:55,910 --> 01:02:59,185
Scott: Well, what if two of our friends don't do it because they are afraid of stalkers.

909
01:02:59,386 --> 01:03:00,150
Scott: Well now it's useless.

910
01:03:00,251 --> 01:03:02,350
Scott: We need to fall back to another system, right?

911
01:03:02,610 --> 01:03:08,750
Rym: Yes, so even if so the solution is pretty simple only for very technological people.

912
01:03:08,810 --> 01:03:23,850
Rym: The solution is to as a group of friends Develop our own system that integrates with all of our technology and not give it to anyone else Mmm, but you know, basically the answer to a lot of these problems is slowly big.

913
01:03:23,870 --> 01:03:27,421
Scott: you know all these cloud computing type problems is slowly becoming.

914
01:03:27,923 --> 01:03:32,836
Scott: everyone make your own private cloud and That is not you know.

915
01:03:32,856 --> 01:03:36,187
Scott: for us we can achieve that but many people cannot.

916
01:03:36,327 --> 01:03:42,013
Rym: well in the long run Maybe the answer is open source clouds that like open source cloud device I mean we sorta.

917
01:03:42,053 --> 01:03:45,330
Scott: I mean think about it's like we set up a laconica server instead of using Twitter.

918
01:03:46,552 --> 01:03:47,475
Rym: Take that to the extreme.

919
01:03:47,515 --> 01:03:59,634
Rym: eventually you buy a cloud computing self-contained open source device bring it home Plug it in buy all the associated dongles like sync them all together and now you have your private cloud Mm-hmm.

920
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:01,610
Rym: I think that's the future in the deck.

921
01:04:01,670 --> 01:04:01,710
Rym: I

922
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:15,760
Scott: mean they do have like the Microsoft home server, but most of those things are for like Low land stuff, you know like in my house all the computers in my house The whole family can share photos and videos and watch movies on the Xbox and those sorts of things, right?

923
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:24,450
Scott: And that's a. you got to just expand that out past the router somehow and let people get at it from no matter where they are Without having to deal with network bullshit.

924
01:04:25,054 --> 01:04:27,823
Scott: and then you've got that All right.

925
01:04:28,144 --> 01:04:28,505
Rym: I don't know.

926
01:04:28,546 --> 01:04:30,995
Rym: I think we've got a lot of topics we could talk about.

927
01:04:31,075 --> 01:04:32,280
Rym: any one of these related.

928
01:04:32,541 --> 01:04:35,692
Scott: I think we can talk about privacy more in general at some future.

929
01:04:35,732 --> 01:04:38,040
Rym: Yeah, but for this point, I think we're done.

930
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:39,081
Scott: I also think we're done.

931
01:04:45,748 --> 01:04:48,270
