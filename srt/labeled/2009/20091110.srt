Rym: It's totally awesome.

51
00:02:31,596 --> 00:02:34,090
Rym: and even the smart co-workers who play video games they are.

52
00:02:35,412 --> 00:02:39,730
Rym: They all play Left 4 Dead on the stupid Xbox, they're like you want to play it.

53
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,357
Rym: I'm like on the Xbox.

54
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:44,270
Rym: is that even that even really a game?

55
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,807
Scott: Yeah, I'm gonna try the demo on the Xbox.

56
00:02:47,848 --> 00:02:53,860
Scott: of course I've already got it on the PC to preload it But I'll try to Xbox one and see how it goes.

57
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,428
Scott: you know just to see what the experience is of these that these other people are having.

58
00:02:59,652 --> 00:03:01,379
Scott: But yeah, if something's on Steam.

59
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:03,810
Scott: Why would you ever I mean the only games?

60
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:14,830
Scott: I would get on the Xbox are either a games not available on Steam or B Games that are optimally played with game pads on a large screen like a castle crashers that you might as well.

61
00:03:16,592 --> 00:03:18,118
Scott: You know what I wish.

62
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:21,249
Scott: that shrine game was on the Xbox instead of on the PC.

63
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:26,909
Scott: glad I'm glad I didn't buy it on the PC yet cuz I'm still holding out Hope that it shows up on something else.

64
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:30,402
Rym: Yeah, like bionic commando would have been good on the Xbox had I had an Xbox.

65
00:03:31,004 --> 00:03:38,384
Scott: actually this X this new excite game just came out for the Wii and But I'm not buying it yet cuz I'm not buying anything cuz I have no monies.

66
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:40,479
Rym: ah No monies.

67
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,410
Rym: I have plenty of monies.

68
00:03:42,252 --> 00:03:43,463
Scott: You want to buy me some excite bike?

69
00:03:43,705 --> 00:03:44,310
Rym: not particularly.

70
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:53,509
Rym: I'm trying to figure out what to do with my monies other than do everything I want to do because I Don't want to know by the apartment directly under my apartment on this show.

71
00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:56,250
Rym: lately We've been talking a lot about all this meta stuff before the show.

72
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:00,047
Rym: I'm trying to at least hold off a little bit because like Scott's got his apartment all worked out.

73
00:04:00,067 --> 00:04:05,930
Rym: It's nice, but Dude, I'm trying to buy a house from seems to have skipped town and things are getting crazy And I think I'm gonna have to pay.

74
00:04:08,131 --> 00:04:08,975
Rym: No, I'm not.

75
00:04:09,196 --> 00:04:10,501
Rym: the bank doesn't own it yet.

76
00:04:10,521 --> 00:04:12,227
Rym: I it's so complicated.

77
00:04:12,267 --> 00:04:12,890
Rym: What's going on?

78
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:17,142
Rym: Apparently the bank wants to sell it to me desperately,

79
00:04:17,463 --> 00:04:18,466
Scott: but they

80
00:04:18,567 --> 00:04:18,728
Rym: they

81
00:04:18,788 --> 00:04:19,168
Scott: can't

82
00:04:19,971 --> 00:04:33,233
Rym: until they Foreclose on the dude who disappeared but for closing cost so much money And is such a pain in the ass and it's gonna take so long That the banks like yeah, I don't know what to do and my lawyers like I don't know what to do And I'm like damn

83
00:04:33,253 --> 00:04:34,459
Scott: it after the guy.

84
00:04:34,821 --> 00:04:35,604
Rym: so get this.

85
00:04:35,665 --> 00:04:41,873
Rym: I started looking at other houses And you just take the house like yoink guys not here abandonment yoink No, it takes a while.

86
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:43,038
Rym: foreclosure takes a long time.

87
00:04:43,078 --> 00:04:46,070
Rym: remember our friends landlords and everyone talking about a heart.

88
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,548
Rym: It is to actually evict someone.

89
00:04:49,251 --> 00:05:03,149
Rym: So even worse I find like five other houses that are even nicer than this one and a few from McMansions And they're all you know pretty reasonably priced like under 500 K. So I go to the realtor, and I'm like yeah, can I see these four houses, and she's like.

90
00:05:04,092 --> 00:05:05,858
Rym: One of those is an abandoned foreclosure.

91
00:05:06,219 --> 00:05:10,681
Rym: the other three are short sales that are pretty much in the same boat that the house you're trying to buy now is.

92
00:05:13,211 --> 00:05:24,409
Rym: I'm like are there any non foreclosure short sale houses in Beacon, and she's like Not really Except this one everyone who can afford their houses just living in it going.

93
00:05:24,429 --> 00:05:27,961
Rym: ah Pretty much yeah because the markets so bad that no one said

94
00:05:27,981 --> 00:05:32,972
Scott: about those houses that we looked at before like the one around the Corner or the one that just like the one around the corner Oh, yeah,

95
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:36,850
Rym: all the all the crazy man like the big McMansions are still for sale.

96
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:40,081
Rym: But while as much as I'd like to live in one of those things.

97
00:05:40,603 --> 00:05:59,903
Scott: I can't really justify Just two people living in like a 6,000 square foot house And while I can you see someone posted in the forum of someone that Hampton's mansion The most that's like the most like expansive residential property in the country.

98
00:05:59,963 --> 00:06:01,747
Scott: I think or perhaps the world I forget.

99
00:06:02,369 --> 00:06:04,744
Rym: yeah I don't know what to do at this time.

100
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:11,569
Rym: you owns it Because I'll hold on to my bonuses are but yeah, so I'm still in this house right now.

101
00:06:12,434 --> 00:06:16,417
Scott: So so back in the day there was this Warcraft 3 mod.

102
00:06:16,597 --> 00:06:18,885
Scott: you know my brother actually played a lot of Warcraft 3.

103
00:06:18,885 --> 00:06:23,380
Scott: I didn't but I watched him a bit You know and never good at Warcraft 3.

104
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,262
Scott: I was never good at any.

105
00:06:24,363 --> 00:06:25,827
Scott: RTS is beyond Warcraft 1.

106
00:06:25,827 --> 00:06:32,929
Rym: yeah You saying never good is kind of a misnomer because that's like saying I was never good at the bagpipes.

107
00:06:34,112 --> 00:06:37,165
Rym: You you were terrible at RTS is I've seen you play.

108
00:06:37,266 --> 00:06:39,829
Scott: RTS is Yeah, I suck so.

109
00:06:41,031 --> 00:06:48,759
Scott: But Warcraft 3 had an expansive mod community and one of the most popular mods was what people called dota Which is defense of the ancients.

110
00:06:49,021 --> 00:06:50,690
Rym: it was basically a tower defense game.

111
00:06:51,355 --> 00:06:57,583
Scott: Well, it was somewhat of a tower defense game But not really because you didn't actually like build the towers or control the towers.

112
00:06:58,045 --> 00:06:59,710
Scott: what you did is you controlled one guy.

113
00:07:00,131 --> 00:07:05,232
Scott: It was like you're playing an RTS, but you're one guy, but that one guy has a lot of different stuff You can do.

114
00:07:06,095 --> 00:07:06,356
Scott: you know.

115
00:07:06,436 --> 00:07:07,520
Scott: it's like imagine.

116
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:10,330
Scott: You know it's it's sort of like member in command and conquer.

117
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:16,930
Scott: It was the Tanya unit that could like you know is that's the super commando chick that was I believe red alert.

118
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,259
Scott: Yeah, she was totally awesome right.

119
00:07:19,299 --> 00:07:19,802
Rym: Yeah, that was.

120
00:07:20,144 --> 00:07:21,370
Rym: I remember when rental her came out.

121
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,174
Rym: I was like man.

122
00:07:22,214 --> 00:07:24,023
Rym: this game was kind of new school or in Starcraft.

123
00:07:24,063 --> 00:07:27,020
Scott: There was the ghost unit right so You could.

124
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:40,565
Scott: it was basically Defense of the ancients is basically there's a tower defense game going on right But you are just one guy and the tower defense game is automatic And you got to level up this guy and also attack the other.

125
00:07:40,686 --> 00:07:47,730
Scott: you know properly And this one guy can do like ten times as more things and is like way more powerful than that Tanya unit.

126
00:07:48,374 --> 00:07:51,352
Scott: You know you're controlling it in an RTS fashion It's you know.

127
00:07:51,372 --> 00:07:54,163
Scott: you attack retreat attack the left attack on the right.

128
00:07:54,283 --> 00:07:59,186
Scott: use this ability use that ability You know buy this item you know that sort of thing.

129
00:07:59,789 --> 00:08:06,550
Scott: so That game was pretty popular back in the day and the guys who made it have a new game come in called towers of Neuwirth.

130
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:14,389
Scott: Neuwirth, I don't know how it's supposed to be pronounced, but it's People in the forum giving out the demo keys or the beta keys their beta keys.

131
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:18,590
Scott: yeah I got one I played it last night, and I'm sort of unsure about this game.

132
00:08:18,672 --> 00:08:32,010
Scott: It's like okay It is a game of leveling up And I can see with my eyeballs some rock-paper-scissors elements to it And it's it's incredibly suspicious like ah you could well remember all games have those elements.

133
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:39,549
Scott: I mean you look at this game on the surface from our perspective, and you're like This is not looking like a good game to me.

134
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:42,690
Scott: This is look at every hallmark of a bad game, right?

135
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:53,946
Scott: But I actually played it and I played it a couple times and learned how to play and learned how it works And it was actually like an incredibly at least that instance of playing was incredibly good.

136
00:08:54,086 --> 00:09:02,230
Scott: like at first We were getting crushed it was two versus two We were getting crushed and then somehow we like pulled it out in the end in dramatic fashion.

137
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:09,810
Scott: It was incredibly close to me had a big comeback, and it was like whoa Something going on in this game even though it has all these hallmarks of bad games.

138
00:09:10,613 --> 00:09:12,401
Scott: Well, remember good game happened.

139
00:09:12,481 --> 00:09:13,445
Rym: I don't know where I can remember.

140
00:09:13,546 --> 00:09:22,433
Rym: also even Ostensibly bad games can be good in the sense that they're made in such a way that they're fun regardless of how bad they actually Are.

141
00:09:22,474 --> 00:09:23,689
Scott: I mean no so I'm gonna.

142
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:27,890
Scott: I'm gonna play it a few more times to be sure probably beginning after when we're done with this show.

143
00:09:28,451 --> 00:09:38,881
Scott: but if you if you are interested in this kind of game you should come to the forum dot front recruiter calm or Elsewhere and you should get beta keys for heroes of net worth.

144
00:09:38,961 --> 00:09:44,142
Scott: and then if you pay $30 only $30 They you can basically get the full game.

145
00:09:44,162 --> 00:09:52,050
Rym: You know with a pre-order God, so if you pre-purchase Left 4 Dead 2, you know you get.

146
00:09:53,172 --> 00:09:57,832
Rym: You get the hat that the military guy wore in the original Left 4 Dead Mm-hmm.

147
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:01,310
Scott: well you were the one who pre-purchases you get the hat or do I?

148
00:10:02,693 --> 00:10:02,893
Rym: I was.

149
00:10:03,014 --> 00:10:04,758
Rym: I did not yet finish that sentence.

150
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:10,090
Rym: you get the hat for your Team Fortress 2 guy.

151
00:10:13,292 --> 00:10:18,499
Rym: Get a special hat in Team Fortress 2 So they're not mailing you a hat.

152
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:24,530
Rym: so if I go play Team Fortress 2 right now I can put on that hat and wear it around the game while I'm playing.

153
00:10:24,992 --> 00:10:26,921
Scott: Who gives a shit that that?

154
00:10:27,443 --> 00:10:28,709
Rym: I have a feeling that I don't know.

155
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:44,110
Rym: I'm worried because they've already gotten so much leveling and so much achievement like game affecting stuff in Team Fortress 2 and I'm worried that in the long run Any like valve games are gonna start having this stuff all over the place.

156
00:10:44,993 --> 00:10:47,722
Scott: I think that the world has realized something right.

157
00:10:47,742 --> 00:10:49,910
Scott: you know how we look at things like fake medicine.

158
00:10:50,031 --> 00:10:51,458
Scott: We're like ah these assholes.

159
00:10:51,478 --> 00:10:53,870
Scott: They're making all this money off fake medicine those bastards.

160
00:10:53,930 --> 00:11:02,198
Scott: They can go to hell and die right, but look at what's going on like like Zynga and valve and World of Warcraft And all these other companies out there.

161
00:11:02,218 --> 00:11:02,781
Scott: There are a lot of them.

162
00:11:02,921 --> 00:11:07,937
Scott: Those aren't even the worst offenders right and You know a guy online right.

163
00:11:07,997 --> 00:11:15,525
Scott: they're basically taking people's money in exchange for nothing Just like a hat a virtual hat on the Xbox.

164
00:11:15,585 --> 00:11:26,383
Scott: right there was a thing I could have gotten like a Giants New York Giants You know Jersey for my avatar, but they wanted to charge me real American dollars for that.

165
00:11:26,403 --> 00:11:27,128
Scott: so I'm like fuck.

166
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:33,791
Scott: no Why would I spend money on that if it was free sure but at the same time it were like even one penny is not worth It.

167
00:11:33,891 --> 00:11:37,126
Scott: yet all these people are making money by selling nothing.

168
00:11:37,226 --> 00:11:45,269
Scott: I think Either a we have to decide that that's morally offensive Almost as morally offensive as fake medicine and that we shouldn't do it.

169
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:49,204
Rym: I don't think that's because it's definitely be be.

170
00:11:49,485 --> 00:11:52,678
Scott: we should start selling fake shit So we can get some fucking money now.

171
00:11:52,738 --> 00:11:57,822
Rym: the problem with that is that we're getting very close I think to a gluts and then there's going to be a decline.

172
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,650
Scott: you think there's gonna be a decline.

173
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:10,590
Scott: You don't think that using basic psychology to just get people to fork over real money for virtual goods will always work Not always in a vacuum because it's not just usually most of the people who buy this stuff.

174
00:12:10,953 --> 00:12:13,050
Rym: They get it work better in the foreseeable future.

175
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:18,250
Rym: They get it within The context of some other thing that they're paying for that they actually for whatever reason enjoy.

176
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:18,953
Rym: now That might be a thing.

177
00:12:18,973 --> 00:12:22,450
Scott: you have to make the thing that they enjoy and then sell them the virtual goods in it.

178
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:23,408
Scott: That's that's how it works.

179
00:12:23,753 --> 00:12:24,520
Rym: But not only that.

180
00:12:24,601 --> 00:12:30,188
Rym: some people only Actually, I mean some people do it for the prestige like the people had those badges in NS back in the day.

181
00:12:30,269 --> 00:12:30,610
Rym: the people who?

182
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,137
Rym: Get this tf2 hat or whatever.

183
00:12:32,157 --> 00:12:34,890
Scott: You can use the black armor in all the time.

184
00:12:38,893 --> 00:12:42,143
Rym: Thing is I would have paid the $40 anyway because that is basically.

185
00:12:42,163 --> 00:12:44,570
Rym: I remember when I donated money to Obama's primary.

186
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:49,110
Scott: Can you want to hear a surprise a somewhat surprising but also not surprising thing?

187
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:55,968
Scott: Something like 95% old news and it's two pre-orders are 40 or the $40 one and almost nobody bought the $20 one.

188
00:12:56,952 --> 00:13:06,310
Rym: But kind of like how I've donated money to Obama's primary just because it was like alright I'm basically putting my money in the lottery that maybe something cool will happen.

189
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:09,602
Rym: It was the same thing with NS - it's like alright my extra $20.

190
00:13:09,602 --> 00:13:11,850
Scott: Yeah, how did that work out for you?

191
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:17,054
Scott: Yeah, yeah, but but Anything cool happen.

192
00:13:17,495 --> 00:13:18,639
Rym: Oh, yes, it's happening.

193
00:13:19,441 --> 00:13:19,682
Scott: Uh-huh.

194
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:20,143
Scott: Yeah.

195
00:13:20,164 --> 00:13:20,545
Scott: Okay.

196
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:22,250
Rym: Anyway, I don't want to get into politics.

197
00:13:22,371 --> 00:13:22,632
Rym: Mr.

198
00:13:22,673 --> 00:13:25,390
Rym: Doesn't pay attention doesn't know anything about what's going on in the world at all.

199
00:13:25,952 --> 00:13:39,289
Rym: But that aside aren't exactly paying my extra $20 to NS is basically me saying look If there's even a tiny chance of NS to happening I have to give the money to make sure that that chance goes up by a tiny percent.

200
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:43,184
Scott: Yeah, but I'm you know, the black armor part is yeah.

201
00:13:43,204 --> 00:13:44,770
Rym: Well, the black armor was just a nice thing.

202
00:13:45,912 --> 00:13:47,824
Rym: If it had been say, I don't know the

203
00:13:47,844 --> 00:13:51,121
Scott: black armor is nice But the at the team fortress hat is not nice

204
00:13:51,563 --> 00:14:00,768
Rym: because the team I don't care about Team Fortress 2 is not going to be made better or worse by that and left 4 dead is coming out Regardless of whether or not I get that hat.

205
00:14:01,251 --> 00:14:05,910
Scott: So, you know what they should have done is they should have let you use Team Fortress 2 guys in left 4 dead.

206
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:09,790
Scott: So it's like I'll pick Engineer and play left 4 dead and set up a turn.

207
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:13,463
Scott: Oh my god, I might say funny things that they always do.

208
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:15,090
Rym: I might pay a small amount of money.

209
00:14:15,656 --> 00:14:18,563
Rym: We just make that a mod dude, yeah.

210
00:14:21,817 --> 00:14:27,370
Scott: But the Team Fortress Pick four of them and put them in left 4 dead and don't change anything left 4 dead except for that.

211
00:14:27,912 --> 00:14:31,570
Rym: But I want to even have their powers and just have heavy weapons guys standing there.

212
00:14:36,892 --> 00:14:38,758
Scott: I'm saying it'll be exactly the same as you'll be.

213
00:14:38,798 --> 00:14:44,697
Scott: it'll feel like you're playing Team Fortress 2 only the map and the Objectives and the bad guys will be.

214
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:45,942
Scott: you know, left 4 dead.

215
00:14:45,962 --> 00:14:57,145
Scott: So it'd be like, you know, oh it's a witch Thing is you need some voice acting cuz you need like the heavy to be like Oh which do not go scare her That's the best you could do.

216
00:15:04,213 --> 00:15:05,382
Scott: So maybe she's news.

217
00:15:06,128 --> 00:15:16,869
Rym: so Super Mario Brothers we it's coming out, you know, I know it's coming out because Out for a while and like all the news is talking about how it's gonna know.

218
00:15:17,131 --> 00:15:19,309
Scott: But I mean I walked past the Nintendo store the other day.

219
00:15:20,472 --> 00:15:26,450
Scott: It was just all the windows had a gigantic Mario in them like it was just the craziest Mario setup ever.

220
00:15:26,633 --> 00:15:28,414
Rym: It was just well It's gonna have the.

221
00:15:28,675 --> 00:15:30,282
Rym: it's in that red case and they make it.

222
00:15:30,302 --> 00:15:34,401
Rym: a lot of people are making a big deal about the red Case and Reggie was going on and on about it.

223
00:15:34,421 --> 00:15:36,470
Rym: This game is gonna sell more than modern warfare.

224
00:15:38,131 --> 00:15:38,976
Scott: It's gonna be a tough.

225
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,383
Scott: It's gonna be a close race.

226
00:15:40,463 --> 00:15:43,290
Scott: I think yeah How about that modern warfare game?

227
00:15:44,052 --> 00:15:48,950
Scott: Like I never I barely even heard of that game and then suddenly I just keep seeing people talk about it a little bit.

228
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,819
Scott: Well, why is exploded suddenly?

229
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,830
Scott: It's like it's fucking like taking over the world.

230
00:15:53,312 --> 00:16:02,330
Rym: I've I knew I saw it on the horizon for a long time because there was all this weird meta news about it And I thought people to go in mw2 and I was like is mech warrior to make it a comeback?

231
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:14,938
Rym: Yeah, but that kind of culminated in the fact that if you buy the bonus box, it comes with a bust of some dudes face and an actual night-vision goggles set like for real.

232
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,887
Rym: like actually how much is that set there?

233
00:16:17,907 --> 00:16:21,800
Rym: Uh, Over a hundred and fifty dollars.

234
00:16:22,202 --> 00:16:23,490
Scott: How much is night vision goggle?

235
00:16:24,051 --> 00:16:28,124
Rym: I have no idea but it's only ninety dollars more than buying the game by itself.

236
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:31,639
Rym: and it comes with this guy's face and Night vision goggles.

237
00:16:31,901 --> 00:16:32,709
Rym: and I watched a video.

238
00:16:35,132 --> 00:16:36,215
Rym: They are well I watched.

239
00:16:36,236 --> 00:16:40,530
Rym: the thing is they're kind of ungainly but I watched bleep-bloop of all people they had.

240
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:42,038
Rym: They didn't review the game.

241
00:16:42,058 --> 00:16:50,568
Rym: They're like whatever on the game, but they reviewed the night vision goggles And he like goes into the closet and he's like I see a broom and stuff.

242
00:16:50,689 --> 00:16:50,990
Rym: they work.

243
00:16:58,177 --> 00:16:59,500
Rym: Yeah, so night vision goggles?

244
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,282
Scott: I don't.

245
00:17:01,322 --> 00:17:02,827
Rym: even the bust of the guy's head is like.

246
00:17:03,308 --> 00:17:05,954
Rym: I think it's to hold the night vision goggles when you're not wearing them.

247
00:17:05,976 --> 00:17:10,892
Rym: Oh That makes sense, but it's kind of a silly mw2.

248
00:17:10,912 --> 00:17:12,759
Scott: This is a Call of Duty game, right?

249
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,240
Rym: Yeah It's like the sequel to mw1, which was Call of Duty 4.

250
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:21,980
Rym: Anyway, those games were so under my radar that I basically I know it's so weird.

251
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:27,815
Scott: It's like everyone was playing quake Counter-Strike, you know tribes all those unreal tournament right all these.

252
00:17:27,855 --> 00:17:33,992
Scott: the real FPS is Yeah, I said it and then it's sort of like they started coming out with these.

253
00:17:34,092 --> 00:17:42,526
Scott: war FPS is for like the PlayStation 1 era You know, they came up with a Call of Duty or what were some of the other ones like men at war I don't even know.

254
00:17:42,566 --> 00:17:43,552
Scott: just make it up name man.

255
00:17:43,612 --> 00:17:44,780
Scott: It was like it seemed.

256
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:50,068
Scott: Yeah It seemed like there were a whole bunch of like just generic war FPS's that were coming out of the PlayStation.

257
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,493
Scott: the PlayStation 2.

258
00:17:51,493 --> 00:17:54,839
Rym: does a Wolfenstein count Castle Einstein?

259
00:17:55,704 --> 00:17:56,519
Scott: No, it's a war.

260
00:17:57,382 --> 00:17:59,823
Scott: Yeah, I guess you know the Xbox 360 This is.

261
00:17:59,843 --> 00:18:15,660
Scott: they kept coming out with a whole bunch of these generic war FPS's one after the other and he just kept coming out with them and coming out with them and I don't recall them really ever being that Popular like you didn't see you know, I didn't see a lot of people playing them or talking about him.

262
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:25,940
Scott: but it's like just more recently like they've just like the popularity of these things is going like Like like exponentially up and it's like where the hell did these things come from?

263
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:29,975
Scott: It's like, you know, it's at all like the halo people switch over to them or something.

264
00:18:30,035 --> 00:18:31,140
Scott: It's like, I don't know.

265
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:41,689
Rym: But the thing about this is one I wonder what's gonna happen to release dates in the future because Apparently GameStop just started selling the game early.

266
00:18:41,709 --> 00:18:44,820
Scott: I think they just said that they said that it was on purpose.

267
00:18:44,962 --> 00:18:46,259
Rym: They know they admitted straight up.

268
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,132
Rym: They said it was on purpose and they talked to Activision about it.

269
00:18:49,454 --> 00:18:54,759
Rym: and they were doing it because other Retailers in the same areas had already started selling it earlier.

270
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,372
Scott: Yeah, well, I think that's because if you're a tiny retailer, right?

271
00:18:58,413 --> 00:19:01,911
Scott: Like let's say your dragon's dead, you know You could order like five copies of it.

272
00:19:02,535 --> 00:19:03,259
Scott: sell them early.

273
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:08,116
Scott: Get some business, you know, not only that if I were them I would not have otherwise got.

274
00:19:08,217 --> 00:19:10,946
Rym: I would sell them early For more money.

275
00:19:10,966 --> 00:19:13,936
Rym: Oh, of course, I'd be like extra 50 bucks.

276
00:19:14,076 --> 00:19:15,060
Rym: get it today.

277
00:19:15,906 --> 00:19:17,479
Scott: Yeah, of course, they would totally do that.

278
00:19:17,721 --> 00:19:18,543
Rym: But the thing is so.

279
00:19:18,944 --> 00:19:22,656
Rym: I think these things only matter now for physical media distribution.

280
00:19:22,957 --> 00:19:28,499
Rym: any I mean in Steam left for dead just activates at the same time for everyone in the world at the same time and that's it.

281
00:19:28,904 --> 00:19:29,919
Rym: There's none of this BS.

282
00:19:31,262 --> 00:19:50,499
Scott: No, but I think what it is is that with physical media distribution Basically, you just have to accept the fact that if you send product to a retailer They can sell it immediately and it's only like the very large and punishable Retailers like Best Buy that you're actually going to be able to like put a leash on them and force them to do what you

283
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:50,680
Rym: know.

284
00:19:50,862 --> 00:19:51,320
Rym: No, no, no.

285
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,745
Rym: I think there's another problem there.

286
00:19:52,806 --> 00:19:57,928
Rym: the bigger a retailer is for your business the more clout they have to say Yeah, we sold it early.

287
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:01,604
Rym: What you're not gonna ship us your next game Right.

288
00:20:01,804 --> 00:20:01,965
Scott: No.

289
00:20:02,005 --> 00:20:04,455
Scott: Well, yeah, it depends on what you're selling right.

290
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:07,064
Scott: cuz look with Apple It's the exact opposite.

291
00:20:07,546 --> 00:20:11,880
Scott: Apple basically says if you sell iPods, you will not discount them one penny.

292
00:20:12,201 --> 00:20:18,900
Scott: In fact, you will not discount any Apple product even one penny ever under any circumstances even when they're doing like clearance.

293
00:20:19,102 --> 00:20:21,120
Scott: You know, we're going out of business at Circuit City.

294
00:20:21,481 --> 00:20:28,100
Scott: The iPods are the same price because if you you know Apple has everyone by the goddamn balls.

295
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:32,480
Scott: So, you know, it just depends on who you are how much you can push them around or not.

296
00:20:32,781 --> 00:20:41,078
Rym: but look we're getting into the point to where until the collapse of physical media is complete and At that point Walmart's gonna be pretty much the sole retailer of anything like that.

297
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:55,239
Scott: GameStop I think still has enough cloud to say fuck you Yeah, but I think also in a way it's sort of like You know GameStop does have the clout because you know GameStop makes a lot of money for now game.

298
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:02,498
Scott: But at the same time right GameStop also really needed it cuz it's like they're losing to.

299
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:05,580
Scott: you know Amazon and there's a lot of pressure coming down on them.

300
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:09,094
Rym: Well at this by the say at the same time give them a slight advantage.

301
00:21:09,215 --> 00:21:12,496
Rym: at the same time yet again GameStop because they're basically pawn shops.

302
00:21:12,516 --> 00:21:16,674
Rym: at this point They don't even need the first runs anymore.

303
00:21:16,755 --> 00:21:25,772
Rym: people will buy stuff on Amazon Anyway, and they should just if they ever get new stuff sell it early because that's the only way they'll sell it and just give the big flying finger to everyone.

304
00:21:25,792 --> 00:21:31,560
Rym: and When people buy stuff on Amazon, they'll sell it back to GameStop.

305
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:35,800
Rym: But then they can sell it in the cycle because Amazon's doing sellbacks now.

306
00:21:36,001 --> 00:21:37,149
Scott: So it's like we'll see.

307
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,680
Rym: the thing is it's game design for that?

308
00:21:38,845 --> 00:21:41,687
Scott: No Amazon sellback best buy was starting to do.

309
00:21:41,807 --> 00:21:43,853
Scott: use games in some places to Amazon.

310
00:21:43,893 --> 00:21:46,180
Rym: sellback only works for the people with credit cards.

311
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:49,500
Rym: the Primary demographic of sellbacks is punk kids with no credit card.

312
00:21:50,623 --> 00:21:57,472
Rym: Once we get to the point of punk kids having a credit card equivalent Entire spheres of the economy will disappear overnight.

313
00:21:57,934 --> 00:21:59,500
Scott: Yeah, I remember one gigantic.

314
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,085
Scott: You know kids are.

315
00:22:01,265 --> 00:22:06,420
Scott: the major limitation of kids buying things is not that they are completely broke because they got money.

316
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,706
Scott: They don't have a lot but they got money.

317
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:10,540
Scott: They got enough to buy a video game in once in a while, right?

318
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,697
Scott: The thing is is a they don't have a credit card and B They don't have a car.

319
00:22:15,101 --> 00:22:21,580
Scott: So even they can't buy anything unless it's in a physical store or their parents buy it for them Which is ha ha ha right not gonna happen.

320
00:22:22,522 --> 00:22:27,279
Scott: And B even if they got the money and they want to spend it They have to wait for their parents to take them to the store.

321
00:22:28,081 --> 00:22:40,584
Scott: Even today in this modern world unless your parents are totally awesome, you know, so Even if you give your kid one of those kids credit cards that I discovered You know, it's like It's not enough.

322
00:22:41,186 --> 00:22:42,110
Scott: You know, they got it.

323
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:44,600
Scott: They got to be able to get there to get the stuff or whatever.

324
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,652
Rym: Okay update here the.

325
00:22:48,054 --> 00:22:51,730
Rym: I did some investigation I found another link a better link that I'll use for my news link.

326
00:22:52,152 --> 00:23:02,313
Rym: the night-vision goggles that come with the game are made by and suspiciously similar to The same company that makes some crappy like I clops toy.

327
00:23:02,374 --> 00:23:10,407
Rym: That's 50 bucks at Toys R Us And that I clops toy is a night-vision goggle thing Yep, and I was looking online for like 200 bucks.

328
00:23:10,428 --> 00:23:13,296
Rym: You can get actual like Soviet military grade.

329
00:23:13,397 --> 00:23:16,715
Scott: I like night-vision But I don't want shitty Soviet ones.

330
00:23:16,775 --> 00:23:22,475
Rym: I want yeah Us ones or something for under five hundred for under five hundred dollars.

331
00:23:22,515 --> 00:23:23,860
Rym: You can get badass night vision.

332
00:23:24,283 --> 00:23:24,827
Scott: I want the cut.

333
00:23:24,847 --> 00:23:25,995
Scott: I want the counter-strike kind of one.

334
00:23:26,015 --> 00:23:26,679
Scott: So everything's green.

335
00:23:27,221 --> 00:23:30,332
Rym: They're all like that because green is the color that's the most sensitive to our eyes.

336
00:23:30,372 --> 00:23:32,078
Scott: Basically very good.

337
00:23:32,258 --> 00:23:40,560
Rym: Yes Yes, you can also detect if someone's using night vision pretty easily because they just at least this kind of night vision is a use a flashbang and they go.

338
00:23:41,204 --> 00:23:46,600
Rym: No Because this is the kind that illuminates the area with IR then has a camera.

339
00:23:47,161 --> 00:23:53,360
Rym: So if you just if you just look for IR, you'll see like this basically a flashlight coming out of the dude's face.

340
00:23:58,821 --> 00:23:59,604
Rym: You basically have to.

341
00:23:59,644 --> 00:24:18,430
Rym: there's either active night vision or there's passive night vision a passive night vision as far as I know is not That great because you basically have to rely on the extent light In some form Doesn't matter because the most militaries in the world people don't even have the Toys R Us night vision.

342
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,732
Rym: Sadly that's very true.

343
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:23,354
Scott: Yeah, very sad.

344
00:24:23,374 --> 00:24:26,859
Rym: Okay, but this modern warfare thing really look what's happening here.

345
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:27,640
Rym: I've realized it.

346
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:35,740
Rym: all These kids who grew up playing the console FPS is are going through the same evolution that the computer FPS is went through.

347
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:41,964
Rym: we started with you know after doom and Crappy Wolfenstein 3d after he got past the initial steps.

348
00:24:42,305 --> 00:24:43,430
Rym: What was popular at first?

349
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:51,089
Rym: It was the FPS is that were like quake deathmatch II kind of stuff like the original halo like that's our like golden eye that kind of stuff that they were playing.

350
00:24:51,109 --> 00:24:56,390
Rym: and Then as it moved on they started getting more and more about the series business war realistic kind of things.

351
00:24:56,974 --> 00:24:58,830
Rym: You know the all these World War two, whatever.

352
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:01,599
Rym: that's basically when we found out about action quake and counter-strike.

353
00:25:02,381 --> 00:25:07,530
Rym: and I guess the next step is they're gonna move into the Tribe Z area.

354
00:25:08,811 --> 00:25:15,230
Scott: Yeah, I don't see that happening because the tribe Z area games are far too complex to even do with the expo.

355
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:26,790
Rym: I'll have to because while the games are pretty bad all things considered still just because of the you know, the sheer limitation of the controllers Eventually, these kids are gonna realize the limitations and get sick of playing on the console.

356
00:25:28,831 --> 00:25:31,496
Rym: One would hope I got a lot of confidence.

357
00:25:31,516 --> 00:25:41,397
Rym: That's the only hope I've got left because NS two And a little bit of leopard ed 2 are some of the last games on the horizon that I care about at all.

358
00:25:41,417 --> 00:25:48,240
Scott: I Think we'll be alright Enough games for us to play and enough people playing them that we will be safe.

359
00:25:48,541 --> 00:25:50,588
Rym: It's a poor simulacrum, but there's really.

360
00:25:50,608 --> 00:25:54,522
Rym: there's nothing that can replace tribes - No, not really.

361
00:25:54,924 --> 00:25:58,136
Rym: Nothing not even tribes - it's too much of a pain in the ass to play it anywhere.

362
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,909
Scott: Yeah, there is a. there's a remake of mech warrior 2 out there that I'm gonna The real mw2.

363
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:17,909
Rym: Yeah But anyway things of the day.

364
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:26,416
Rym: so Emily and Alex work from use games and we had the trailer for their new game guns vicarous and It's finally actually out.

365
00:26:26,958 --> 00:26:28,623
Rym: So it's my thing of the day for one.

366
00:26:28,663 --> 00:26:36,356
Rym: You can just buy it and play the demo but - I bitched to Alex because there was a Feature that was sorely lacking.

367
00:26:36,397 --> 00:26:39,389
Rym: that only as far as I can tell me and Scott Johnson care about.

368
00:26:40,634 --> 00:26:42,490
Scott: A lot of people care about the inverted mouse.

369
00:26:43,073 --> 00:26:45,766
Rym: So I went I got I played the demo and I was like Alex.

370
00:26:45,786 --> 00:26:46,650
Rym: There's no inverted mouse.

371
00:26:46,751 --> 00:26:47,696
Rym: I can't buy this game.

372
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:49,486
Rym: and Alex was like damn it.

373
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:56,781
Rym: And then two days later He's like I coded you stupid inverted mouse and Scott Johnson You know if checkbox negative one.

374
00:26:56,801 --> 00:26:58,405
Rym: Yeah, you had to do a little bit.

375
00:26:58,446 --> 00:26:59,790
Rym: It was more than it wasn't trivial.

376
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:01,935
Scott: It's it's not hard.

377
00:27:02,136 --> 00:27:05,469
Rym: No, it's not hard and non-trivial or two entirely different things.

378
00:27:06,551 --> 00:27:12,756
Rym: Anyway, but he did it the games like eight bucks and I bought it because it was fun and It's really hard.

379
00:27:12,856 --> 00:27:15,690
Rym: Yeah, well then you got to play it with actual other people.

380
00:27:15,831 --> 00:27:18,269
Scott: If you try to play it alone, you're only gonna beat one level.

381
00:27:18,571 --> 00:27:29,183
Rym: Yeah, if you need other people to get more than one level but playing it with other people like with some voice chat I'm feeling this Confluence like it's a proof of concept for a kind of game.

382
00:27:29,223 --> 00:27:33,390
Rym: Like if you go to the next step with this game It's like you've got almost a tower.

383
00:27:34,014 --> 00:27:42,010
Scott: If I was them what I would do is I would work on a new game But I would keep polishing this one because with enough polish it could it could be something good.

384
00:27:42,251 --> 00:27:48,030
Scott: It's so close to like you as polish also gives you know more incentive for people to pay for it as well.

385
00:27:48,191 --> 00:27:56,835
Rym: Cuz yeah knowing that they're gonna get more polish in the future You know, it's just I'll admit like honestly and this isn't just me saying it because you know We know the people who made the game.

386
00:27:56,976 --> 00:28:05,652
Rym: It's different from a lot of games out there and anything That's different makes me very happy unless it's different in a bad way Mm-hmm.

387
00:28:06,374 --> 00:28:07,719
Scott: Yeah, it definitely is unique.

388
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:15,649
Scott: All right, so there's a Sun micro systems, you know, they do a lot of open source stuff actually a ton of it.

389
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:26,341
Scott: Yeah one one thing that they did Ways back that I forgot the name of then remember the name of that forgot the name of then remember the name of then lost Then found again is the thing called project dark star.

390
00:28:26,742 --> 00:28:30,875
Scott: and basically Sun made this Server, you know, it's it's.

391
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:36,650
Scott: it's just sort of a server that you can use as a server for any multiplayer online game.

392
00:28:37,071 --> 00:28:45,862
Scott: So if you want to make a multiplayer online game and need a server you can use project dark star and it's like, you know Making an MMO use this, you know making a counter-strike.

393
00:28:45,982 --> 00:28:48,230
Scott: use this and it's you know.

394
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:49,736
Scott: I never actually used it.

395
00:28:50,398 --> 00:29:12,838
Scott: But what I have found here is a Lab 55 62 project snowman developing a 3d multiplayer game using project dark star and this is a 7-step tutorial that from start to finish you will make a multiplayer online game in Pro in project dark star.

396
00:29:13,581 --> 00:29:15,530
Scott: so and it's all free stuff here.

397
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:22,327
Scott: so, you know and this tells you everything and gives you absolutely everything you need and You don't need any.

398
00:29:23,232 --> 00:29:25,298
Scott: You know, you don't need any spend any money.

399
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:26,542
Scott: You don't need to.

400
00:29:26,622 --> 00:29:28,307
Scott: you know know anything about.

401
00:29:28,487 --> 00:29:34,950
Scott: you know programming But some Java would help you out quite a bit, you know, and you can follow these instructions.

402
00:29:35,437 --> 00:29:36,046
Scott: It takes about.

403
00:29:36,067 --> 00:29:39,053
Scott: let's see It tells you that it takes about two hours But who knows how long?

404
00:29:39,073 --> 00:29:44,229
Scott: you know that may vary and you can make a multiplayer 3d online game.

405
00:29:45,257 --> 00:29:46,348
Scott: So that's that's pretty cool.

406
00:29:47,812 --> 00:29:51,229
Scott: I'm gonna try it out so I can learn and see if this engine is any good or not.

407
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:52,915
Scott: It's the competition.

408
00:29:53,577 --> 00:29:57,670
Rym: So very briefly the meta minutes just to point out Scott's coming.

409
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,202
Scott: I met a minute Scott's coming in over Skype.

410
00:30:00,523 --> 00:30:01,930
Rym: We're totally fast and loose.

411
00:30:02,131 --> 00:30:03,959
Rym: We're not editing like we normally do at all.

412
00:30:03,999 --> 00:30:05,888
Rym: GeekNights is almost fast karate.

413
00:30:05,928 --> 00:30:09,970
Rym: at this point We'll be back to normal.

414
00:30:11,051 --> 00:30:12,157
Scott: We'll be back to normal.

415
00:30:12,217 --> 00:30:13,484
Scott: it's it's slow I do.

416
00:30:13,825 --> 00:30:14,690
Rym: it's space karate.

417
00:30:15,672 --> 00:30:17,809
Rym: It's like regular karate, but it's half as powerful.

418
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:23,505
Rym: Yeah, need like a thousand regular karate is to get one space karate or no the opposite of that.

419
00:30:23,545 --> 00:30:24,930
Rym: In fact, yeah.

420
00:30:25,655 --> 00:30:32,484
Rym: Anyway, the only thing I want to point out is that one Connecticut next summer where the heads of panels panel registration is open.

421
00:30:32,504 --> 00:30:36,680
Rym: if you have a panel and you want to submit it for consideration Send us your panel.

422
00:30:36,862 --> 00:30:43,289
Rym: We're looking for Panels other than anime panels particularly gaming and other cool stuff.

423
00:30:44,173 --> 00:30:45,358
Scott: Anime is also good though.

424
00:30:45,398 --> 00:30:47,266
Scott: We do need some animes and mangas.

425
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:48,190
Scott: Mangas are better.

426
00:30:48,592 --> 00:30:48,853
Scott: You know.

427
00:30:48,894 --> 00:30:50,603
Scott: if you got some mangas bring that on.

428
00:30:50,824 --> 00:30:56,030
Scott: Yeah But yet we also do you want to announce the other thing about Connecticut?

429
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:56,834
Scott: You would hold back.

430
00:30:57,075 --> 00:31:00,275
Rym: we got a hold back because I got to show you all the details We had to give it.

431
00:31:00,476 --> 00:31:06,610
Rym: we had to give it a. it's not actually a silly name But it looks like a silly name if you don't know the history of Connecticut.

432
00:31:07,479 --> 00:31:14,737
Scott: Yeah, anyway The previous Weekend, we were at Zenkai con.

433
00:31:14,917 --> 00:31:19,269
Scott: a good time was had if you discovered us at Zenkai con.

434
00:31:19,309 --> 00:31:26,930
Rym: Hello Yep I'd recommend listening to other episodes from I don't know a month ago or earlier because we're in this weird transitional state right now.

435
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:30,530
Rym: We move all our stuff around so GeekNights is almost on hiatus.

436
00:31:31,272 --> 00:31:37,410
Scott: Yes, the current book club selection is the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy by Douglas Adams.

437
00:31:38,054 --> 00:31:45,245
Scott: only the original none of the you know Prequels or sequels or any other books other than the original book.

438
00:31:45,626 --> 00:31:54,629
Scott: you're probably if you buy it You're probably gonna end up buying like, you know, five or six volumes in one but only the first one will be discussed on the book club episode.

439
00:31:54,649 --> 00:32:01,062
Scott: and Is there anything else we have to discuss in the minute here, I think that's enough.

440
00:32:01,584 --> 00:32:03,949
Rym: that's enough for now back to the the actual show.

441
00:32:04,892 --> 00:32:18,250
Rym: You know, we always diss on the memorpica as being shit and people always used to say I remember Scott You don't even give these games a chance You haven't played World of Warcraft and we've been semi secretly for a while now playing a whole bunch of MMOs.

442
00:32:18,991 --> 00:32:22,888
Scott: Well, I mean the thing is we had played, you know, our defense was that we had played.

443
00:32:22,969 --> 00:32:29,309
Scott: Oh, yeah I played World of Warcraft once for a little bit and I we had always played, you know muds.

444
00:32:29,409 --> 00:32:37,585
Rym: Yep I had played for many years the first MMO Which is still to this day and I now that I've played a whole bunch of other my MMOs.

445
00:32:38,147 --> 00:32:40,474
Rym: There's no Significant difference.

446
00:32:40,534 --> 00:32:44,290
Rym: In fact, there are some ways that modern MMOs are worse than the right.

447
00:32:45,071 --> 00:32:45,998
Scott: Let's wait on that.

448
00:32:46,099 --> 00:32:58,890
Scott: Yeah, so we You know, but people are like, hey you haven't actually Seriously played like all these games, you know, and there are actually surprisingly a lot of MMOs out there a ton of them.

449
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:01,499
Scott: It's like you think they cost so much money to run.

450
00:33:01,539 --> 00:33:04,410
Scott: you got to keep the servers up and the whole thing, right?

451
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:14,250
Scott: It's like you think there wouldn't be that many that are active at once but you know in that World of Warcraft would Obviously that's gonna stick around forever or for incredibly incredibly long time.

452
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:19,542
Scott: But you think the other ones, you know And the thing is actually a lot of them have bled like.

453
00:33:19,562 --> 00:33:23,989
Scott: there are a lot of MMOs that have just they you know a professionally produced published game.

454
00:33:25,171 --> 00:33:27,118
Scott: Not enough people play it and it shuts down.

455
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:30,935
Rym: or even then some of the ones I tried to play like I'd get a demo Just didn't work.

456
00:33:31,459 --> 00:33:32,909
Rym: Yeah, we couldn't even get it to go.

457
00:33:33,992 --> 00:33:35,099
Scott: There was one that I played.

458
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:36,749
Scott: I forget which one it was but it was free.

459
00:33:37,312 --> 00:33:42,032
Scott: But basically the interface on it was so bad that after like 10 seconds It was just on.

460
00:33:42,373 --> 00:33:46,627
Scott: oh there were two that were like that dungeon runners and something else.

461
00:33:46,928 --> 00:33:51,261
Scott: something realms I forget but basically they were just within 30 seconds.

462
00:33:51,722 --> 00:33:52,605
Scott: They were unplayable.

463
00:33:52,625 --> 00:33:54,751
Scott: You see the thing that's really freaked me out Right.

464
00:33:54,852 --> 00:33:57,202
Scott: It's like in a way people were right.

465
00:33:57,262 --> 00:33:59,050
Scott: It's like who are you to talk about MMOs?

466
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,412
Scott: You didn't play it You're not playing them.

467
00:34:00,573 --> 00:34:05,690
Scott: and the thing is I wasn't playing them and I was complaining that oh, they're all these grindy games.

468
00:34:05,851 --> 00:34:11,152
Scott: All you do is click click click click click level up level up level up get to the max level And then there's not.

469
00:34:11,213 --> 00:34:11,695
Scott: what do you do?

470
00:34:11,855 --> 00:34:13,659
Scott: Right and it's there's not.

471
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:16,870
Scott: the actual combat is just rock-paper-scissors BS.

472
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:23,839
Scott: It's not actually very good and you know, it's just the psychological trap and that whole thing I'm not even gonna get into right.

473
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:25,688
Scott: and that's our complaint with MMOs.

474
00:34:26,996 --> 00:34:30,029
Scott: the thing is That may or may not be true.

475
00:34:30,753 --> 00:34:45,850
Scott: I didn't get far enough in any MMO to find out because They were just so bad in these other ways that I did not Except I didn't even get to the point of grinding except surprisingly, you know, we'll talk about this more.

476
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:51,810
Rym: we're gonna do a separate show on like all these MMOs, but People are right World of Warcraft is the best one.

477
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:56,210
Rym: I mean I got to the grind pretty quick and I was able to grind efficiently.

478
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:59,463
Rym: It's like I. we both thought the grind would be the rising Lee.

479
00:34:59,503 --> 00:35:02,405
Scott: I mean I predict I knew that I'm you know that World of Warcraft.

480
00:35:02,426 --> 00:35:09,997
Scott: I Had always said that it's the same as the other ones only it's polished and actually, you know, it's polished well beyond.

481
00:35:10,218 --> 00:35:17,510
Rym: so I guess my point is that we both Expected like the grind to be the bad part and the fact that the games are too shitty to even get to the grind.

482
00:35:17,851 --> 00:35:20,963
Rym: And then Wow selling point is that it gets you right to the grinding.

483
00:35:20,983 --> 00:35:22,690
Rym: It was kind of amazing.

484
00:35:22,831 --> 00:35:27,410
Scott: I mean like every other game that I played so far and I've still got a few more on the list.

485
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:38,422
Scott: I stopped playing because of some other reason but Wow, I stopped playing because well, I had to pay money to continue and More prominently because it was basically kill 10 skeletons.

486
00:35:38,863 --> 00:35:40,568
Scott: now kill 15 skeletons.

487
00:35:40,648 --> 00:35:46,779
Scott: I was like game over But is I could actually kill the 15 skeletons?

488
00:35:46,859 --> 00:35:55,150
Scott: it was doable the controls worked which is you know I mean like that is why Wow is the king, you know, I still gonna make fun of Wow.

489
00:35:55,231 --> 00:35:59,879
Scott: I still don't think it's a good game but It's better than all the other ones.

490
00:35:59,919 --> 00:36:07,215
Scott: and if you're gonna play one, you know Despite any problems that may have if you're not playing Wow Why not?

491
00:36:07,235 --> 00:36:09,169
Scott: because the other ones are just horrendous.

492
00:36:09,229 --> 00:36:11,010
Rym: though I did discover something kind of interesting.

493
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:17,115
Rym: You know I was playing Eve online for a while trying to get into that and then people used to make a joke that like Eve online It's just Excel.

494
00:36:17,135 --> 00:36:18,622
Scott: Yeah, I was gonna make that joke.

495
00:36:18,662 --> 00:36:23,249
Rym: I was about to be like, yeah It's it's more Excel than I thought it was scary.

496
00:36:24,074 --> 00:36:25,542
Rym: What I was about to say I have.

497
00:36:25,582 --> 00:36:28,247
Rym: I'll pretend you didn't ruin my joke Yeah, but then I was.

498
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:37,400
Rym: you know I was at work and someone had installed it on my PC and then I looked around and actually someone went around my company installing Eve online on every computer in my office.

499
00:36:37,621 --> 00:36:40,450
Rym: They called it Excel for some reason, but it's the same game.

500
00:36:42,191 --> 00:36:44,443
Rym: That's what I was about to say, but you totally ruined it.

501
00:36:44,966 --> 00:36:52,149
Scott: That's fine It's so true though Like I didn't realize how true it was until I really spent like a good 20 minutes.

502
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:53,614
Rym: I blame the escapist.

503
00:36:53,855 --> 00:37:01,186
Rym: when we used to read the escapist every other story was like the drama of Eve and reading those I was like wow, that must be the best game ever.

504
00:37:02,372 --> 00:37:06,446
Rym: And then I'd play it and I see that that it's literally just a spreadsheet.

505
00:37:06,507 --> 00:37:08,952
Rym: It's so Nothing.

506
00:37:08,972 --> 00:37:13,345
Scott: Yeah, it's like they would always have these stories about like to be corporations and intrigue.

507
00:37:13,385 --> 00:37:17,301
Scott: and you know, like traitorous ness See any avatars.

508
00:37:17,664 --> 00:37:18,510
Scott: I see spaceships.

509
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:20,441
Scott: How can you have traitorous ness if I don't even see the?

510
00:37:20,481 --> 00:37:22,110
Rym: here's how I would explain it with Eve.

511
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:27,330
Scott: It's like like someone would see some numbers go down in this spreadsheet and they'd be like, oh my god traitorous ness.

512
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:30,962
Scott: It's like imagine at least chose you the dwarves.

513
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:33,070
Rym: imagine if you're playing monopoly or no.

514
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:33,955
Rym: No, let's get even worse.

515
00:37:33,976 --> 00:37:35,888
Rym: You're playing Uno online, right?

516
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:40,242
Rym: But you're playing Uno with like 10,000 people, but it's just Uno.

517
00:37:40,423 --> 00:37:52,970
Rym: It's just Uno and You're all in the same chat room Yelling at each other and you have all this drama that's completely unrelated to the actual game you're playing.

518
00:37:53,893 --> 00:37:55,730
Rym: That's where all that drama comes from an Eve.

519
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:57,377
Rym: It's all this meta clan drama.

520
00:37:57,437 --> 00:38:04,309
Rym: the game itself has about all the drama of me Summing a hundred columns and then dividing them by the number of columns.

521
00:38:06,391 --> 00:38:16,375
Scott: Anyway, so the game that you know Mostly in this episode because we're gonna have to do more episodes about all these MMOs are playing right but mostly I want to talk About the turbine engine.

522
00:38:16,435 --> 00:38:23,147
Scott: apparently there's an MMO engine out there called the turbine engine and apparently a lot of different MMOs use the same exact engine.

523
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:29,948
Scott: and Two games that I played on this engine were Lord of the Rings online which came in our packs goodie bag for free.

524
00:38:30,129 --> 00:38:33,862
Rym: Yeah That game wasn't worth playing tell you a lot.

525
00:38:34,405 --> 00:38:40,725
Scott: and the recently Free to play Dungeons & Dragons online Eberron, whatever right.

526
00:38:40,745 --> 00:38:43,890
Scott: so the Dungeons & Dragons one is free The Lord of the Rings one is not free.

527
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:46,222
Scott: You have to you get a trial and then you have to pay money.

528
00:38:46,644 --> 00:38:47,810
Scott: and but they're on the same engine.

529
00:38:48,151 --> 00:38:52,690
Scott: But I think the Lord of the Rings one is on a newer version of the engine or at least you know.

530
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,577
Scott: It seemed like it was a newer version of the engine.

531
00:38:54,657 --> 00:38:58,190
Scott: Anyway, I couldn't really you know, it was it felt more polished.

532
00:38:58,692 --> 00:39:01,630
Scott: So I assumed it was newer, you know, but it could you know.

533
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:08,381
Scott: But I mean, it's just basically the two games are basically mods on the same engine the same way counter-strike and NS Are on the same engine.

534
00:39:08,907 --> 00:39:12,540
Scott: So Anyway, this engine is turbine engine ought to talk about it.

535
00:39:12,741 --> 00:39:13,202
Scott: Generally.

536
00:39:13,283 --> 00:39:33,035
Scott: first the user interfaces It has like all the menus and stuff are horrendously and needlessly complicated Like you push like F something to bring up a menu and it has like a million widgets and buttons and things and they're not Actually wanted to do what.

537
00:39:33,075 --> 00:39:37,410
Scott: I had to be hidden or I couldn't find it or like I need to manage my inventory.

538
00:39:37,511 --> 00:39:48,686
Scott: I basically had to stand still pull up a whole bunch of screens Drag-and-drop and fiddle and click and fiddle and push buttons the only reasons you get them all off the screen again so I can actually see what was going on.

539
00:39:48,927 --> 00:39:58,962
Rym: none of this got in My way because once I equipped some stuff and it was so tedious to do it all I never bothered again, even with all the items and stuff I was getting because you won every raid no matter what.

540
00:39:59,304 --> 00:40:01,672
Rym: so I didn't even bother equipping the new stuff I was getting.

541
00:40:02,535 --> 00:40:05,344
Scott: so the other major problem I have in this engine, right?

542
00:40:05,364 --> 00:40:06,970
Scott: I mean, I guess, you know, the graphics are fine.

543
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:20,210
Scott: I mean things look like they look, you know, however, the people who made the game made it look It's that the controls are like not Good, because I played Wow first for a while and it was like, alright it controlled the way I expected.

544
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:22,121
Rym: I'm walking around I can zoom the camera in and out.

545
00:40:22,161 --> 00:40:22,825
Rym: Everything's fine.

546
00:40:22,845 --> 00:40:29,950
Rym: I Played D&D online and like I could not walk like I just I could not move around.

547
00:40:30,091 --> 00:40:31,177
Rym: It was so difficult.

548
00:40:31,438 --> 00:40:33,550
Rym: The camera is like the worst camera in the world.

549
00:40:33,993 --> 00:40:36,570
Scott: The worst thing isn't even that because those are bad.

550
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:41,167
Scott: But the worst thing is like trying to pick something up for example in D&D online.

551
00:40:41,267 --> 00:40:42,010
Scott: I hit a bad guy.

552
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:42,533
Scott: He dies.

553
00:40:42,875 --> 00:40:44,224
Scott: He dropped some gold on the ground.

554
00:40:44,345 --> 00:40:44,989
Rym: No, he drops.

555
00:40:45,751 --> 00:40:46,634
Rym: No, no, no.

556
00:40:46,775 --> 00:40:49,225
Rym: No, he drops some fucking copper.

557
00:40:49,506 --> 00:40:51,412
Rym: You don't get gold Right.

558
00:40:51,673 --> 00:40:54,505
Scott: So I have to move the camera so that I can see the copper.

559
00:40:55,007 --> 00:40:55,810
Scott: then I have to click.

560
00:40:55,970 --> 00:41:02,933
Scott: I have to move the mouse like I'm just this tiny spot and click to pick up the copper and it's barely any copper at All.

561
00:41:02,974 --> 00:41:06,160
Scott: it's not enough to do anything You know and I have to keep doing this.

562
00:41:06,361 --> 00:41:08,290
Scott: every time I freakin get a pile of copper.

563
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:09,779
Rym: See at least in Lego games.

564
00:41:09,799 --> 00:41:11,287
Rym: you just walk over it and you get it.

565
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:22,065
Scott: Yeah So the Lord of the Rings Online game was a little bit better in that I was a dwarf and it gave me a quest like pig berries from eight Bushes, so the bushes were glowing which helped a lot.

566
00:41:22,085 --> 00:41:22,970
Scott: It was like, oh, there's a bush.

567
00:41:23,654 --> 00:41:33,827
Scott: So I walk over to the bush and then I click on it and I was actually able to click on the bush because it was kind of big a lot bigger than a pile of copper pieces on The ground and it was like you're not close enough to the bush.

568
00:41:34,371 --> 00:41:40,701
Scott: So I have to move my guy like into the bush and then it's like now It's hard to click on the bush because my guys in the way it's

569
00:41:40,761 --> 00:41:47,290
Rym: feeling like that in general like in combat I'd lose I'd attack and it just wouldn't hit the guy because I wasn't facing him perfectly.

570
00:41:47,712 --> 00:41:52,349
Rym: I'd like back up and like swivel the camera like swivel into him and then hit my attack again.

571
00:41:53,436 --> 00:41:54,168
Scott: Yeah, it's like dude.

572
00:41:54,451 --> 00:42:09,026
Scott: They should just have freaking you know Like the turn-based combat because this you know, if you're gonna have real-time combat, you know Cuz the combat is real time in these games, you know If you're gonna have real-time combat, you need to make it like an action RPG.

573
00:42:09,166 --> 00:42:10,009
Scott: make it freakin.

574
00:42:10,452 --> 00:42:11,821
Scott: You know River City Ransom.

575
00:42:12,083 --> 00:42:12,465
Scott: make it.

576
00:42:12,848 --> 00:42:18,330
Scott: you know Kingdom Hearts where I push the button and I swing and I can use a gamepad and it's just I beat them up.

577
00:42:18,732 --> 00:42:19,214
Scott: You know that?

578
00:42:19,275 --> 00:42:21,990
Scott: give me that kind of real-time combat if that's what you want.

579
00:42:22,334 --> 00:42:28,646
Scott: If you're not gonna do that Don't make like this crappy pain-in-the-ass real-time combat with shitty controls.

580
00:42:28,706 --> 00:42:29,710
Scott: Just go turn base.

581
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:32,830
Scott: Well, the worst thing is make it Baldur's Gate where you pause the game.

582
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:34,702
Rym: It's so obvious what they're doing.

583
00:42:34,944 --> 00:42:35,870
Rym: you look at the interface.

584
00:42:36,232 --> 00:42:39,630
Rym: It looks exactly like a shitty version of World of Warcraft interface.

585
00:42:39,991 --> 00:42:46,209
Rym: The combat is basically identical to Wow except harder to control more pain in the ass and what you do matters less.

586
00:42:46,812 --> 00:43:09,570
Scott: Yep, every single one of these games, you know a lot a surprising number of games Were just straight-up Unabashed World of Warcraft clones and I was like, okay, you know, I guess you know If you're if you're out to make money, you know, you see the World of Warcraft works, you know You're gonna just you know steal from the non-forgotten masters, you know, that's not a bad move But you have to do better than them.

587
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:12,360
Scott: It's the same thing that we see in like the cell phone industry.

588
00:43:12,501 --> 00:43:13,906
Scott: people look at the iPhone and they go.

589
00:43:14,348 --> 00:43:16,540
Scott: Ah That iPhones doing real low.

590
00:43:16,581 --> 00:43:17,365
Scott: We should copy that.

591
00:43:17,406 --> 00:43:17,969
Scott: So what do they do?

592
00:43:18,331 --> 00:43:26,743
Scott: They make a touchscreen phone with square icons on the front that Misses out on all the actually important things that the iPhone does better.

593
00:43:26,803 --> 00:43:28,630
Scott: It's like no you have to actually be better.

594
00:43:28,932 --> 00:43:30,902
Scott: You can't just sort of make a shitty copy.

595
00:43:31,123 --> 00:43:32,310
Scott: That's nowhere near as good.

596
00:43:32,611 --> 00:43:34,536
Scott: You actually need to be better than that.

597
00:43:34,596 --> 00:43:39,290
Scott: people can tell they're not stupid and they're doing the same exact thing.

598
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:40,255
Scott: And it's like really?

599
00:43:40,637 --> 00:43:41,361
Scott: Yes, really?

600
00:43:41,402 --> 00:43:42,910
Scott: That's how the world is.

601
00:43:43,011 --> 00:43:46,050
Scott: I guess people just copy the thing that's great and don't do a good job.

602
00:43:46,513 --> 00:43:48,247
Rym: So the worst thing is, you know, we get into the game.

603
00:43:48,307 --> 00:43:48,590
Rym: It's free.

604
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:56,120
Rym: I make my character and the first thing I notice is that half the classes and Races and stuff aren't available to me.

605
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:57,967
Rym: and it's like for four bucks.

606
00:43:58,007 --> 00:44:06,474
Rym: You can be a monk For another dollar you can be a warforged monk whoo-dee-doo-dee-doo and Like.

607
00:44:06,996 --> 00:44:11,430
Rym: it's one thing that they went to the model of make the game free and charge people for in-game stuff.

608
00:44:12,052 --> 00:44:16,330
Rym: But it's way out of hand like it's worse than gun bound.

609
00:44:19,412 --> 00:44:24,497
Rym: Yeah, but I mean it's just the point to where I went to the website Where and to see what I could buy.

610
00:44:24,517 --> 00:44:27,130
Rym: and it's like you want to want a magic missiles.

611
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:28,555
Rym: You want a wand of healing.

612
00:44:29,016 --> 00:44:33,290
Rym: you want a bauble that gives you plus 50% XP for four hours after you break it.

613
00:44:34,651 --> 00:44:38,725
Rym: Any item in the game anything in the world you could possibly want you can just buy with money.

614
00:44:38,745 --> 00:44:40,009
Rym: you can buy extra levels.

615
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:41,873
Scott: It's ridiculous.

616
00:44:42,174 --> 00:44:42,917
Rym: I didn't even look.

617
00:44:43,017 --> 00:44:46,669
Rym: everything was like five to fifteen dollars as far as I could tell.

618
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:51,181
Scott: Wow, wait five dollars for just like a wand of magic missiles.

619
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:51,944
Rym: one class.

620
00:44:52,024 --> 00:44:53,830
Rym: I wanted to buy was eight bucks.

621
00:44:54,554 --> 00:44:57,570
Rym: You wanted to buy a class as in I would have played it if it was free.

622
00:44:57,651 --> 00:44:58,589
Rym: I would have played that class.

623
00:44:58,851 --> 00:45:00,136
Rym: But the worst thing is like.

624
00:45:00,236 --> 00:45:02,806
Rym: I saw people in the game talking about it and they're like man.

625
00:45:02,846 --> 00:45:03,609
Rym: don't buy that class.

626
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:04,353
Rym: yet I got it.

627
00:45:04,434 --> 00:45:05,821
Rym: It's not that powerful.

628
00:45:05,902 --> 00:45:17,530
Scott: It's not worth the eight bucks Which is interesting because as far as I can tell The stats of the classes made at least public knowledge before you spend your money on them.

629
00:45:17,771 --> 00:45:19,335
Rym: I guess I don't even know.

630
00:45:19,436 --> 00:45:20,359
Rym: it's just stupid.

631
00:45:20,379 --> 00:45:28,066
Rym: and the thing is it more powerful doesn't matter because every raid I played you're just one kind of automatically even on the hard mode.

632
00:45:28,146 --> 00:45:29,150
Scott: It's not the hard mode.

633
00:45:29,311 --> 00:45:30,398
Scott: I know that was surprising.

634
00:45:30,418 --> 00:45:38,069
Scott: Like I thought the hard mode is gonna be grueling But we basically walked in and it was basically shitty gauntlet shitty 3d god.

635
00:45:38,129 --> 00:45:40,564
Rym: Yep I mean I play a fight like a paladin straight up.

636
00:45:40,604 --> 00:45:52,321
Rym: I'm an elven paladin Literally, I stand there the enemies all come at me and I'm just like sword other sword sword other sword sword other sword sword Other sword and they all just die in one hit.

637
00:45:52,985 --> 00:45:53,990
Scott: I was actually a wizard.

638
00:45:53,990 --> 00:46:00,810
Scott: I wanted to actually try to do something tricky, you know Cuz if you're a fighter all you do is stand there hold down the attack button and don't do anything.

639
00:46:01,151 --> 00:46:03,098
Scott: And I was like why even bother?

640
00:46:03,459 --> 00:46:04,402
Scott: so I was a wizard.

641
00:46:04,422 --> 00:46:05,145
Scott: So, you know what I did.

642
00:46:05,607 --> 00:46:06,590
Scott: I stood far away.

643
00:46:06,811 --> 00:46:14,189
Scott: I kind of moved the camera to keep the bad guys on screen and I Kept pushing the magic missile button over and over again and the magic missiles hit the bad guys.

644
00:46:15,051 --> 00:46:15,836
Rym: It's so bad.

645
00:46:15,876 --> 00:46:17,930
Rym: Like it drops you in the bad guys got close to me.

646
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:18,553
Scott: What did I do?

647
00:46:18,573 --> 00:46:24,209
Rym: even though I'm a wizard I held down the regular melee attack button and it killed him Just the same as my sword as far as I could tell.

648
00:46:24,831 --> 00:46:31,430
Rym: Yeah, but it's like it drops you into whatever quest and it's like the evil lord of the Forgotten Land.

649
00:46:32,072 --> 00:46:34,278
Rym: The plot plot plot plot plot.

650
00:46:34,739 --> 00:46:42,661
Rym: you hear the creaking of dange and bones in the distance and Then it drops you into the thing and it's literally like walk by.

651
00:46:42,701 --> 00:46:45,570
Rym: there are a thousand identical sarcophagi if you smile.

652
00:46:45,791 --> 00:46:46,394
Scott: That's right.

653
00:46:46,474 --> 00:46:54,010
Scott: If you're gonna make like a scary, you know dungeon instance kind of thing Why don't you actually like sort of you know design some interesting levels?

654
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:56,559
Scott: These are like it looked like someone was using the.

655
00:46:57,321 --> 00:47:05,230
Scott: you know, like the mage master whatever they're called D&D thingies like you walk around together the same map with the same different maps with the same pieces.

656
00:47:05,351 --> 00:47:07,370
Rym: It's like a thousand barrels in the storehouse.

657
00:47:07,651 --> 00:47:11,780
Rym: Everyone you smash has like two copper pieces that come out that you have to click on to pick up.

658
00:47:12,635 --> 00:47:14,933
Rym: Yeah So we won't.

659
00:47:14,953 --> 00:47:17,464
Rym: we play a bunch and we find even a tedious grind.

660
00:47:17,524 --> 00:47:19,030
Scott: It's like a tedious clean up the level.

661
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:26,960
Scott: I mean Lego Star Wars is better than this because at least Lego Star Wars is Sort of you know easier and you could just walk over the golds to pick them up, you know.

662
00:47:27,703 --> 00:47:46,819
Rym: So the worst thing is Scott, you know We both play it on our own for a while and I keep saying the worst thing because they keep getting worse And it played like it has this kind of initial, you know Here's how the game starts introduce some characters get you to a town and at the end of the quest It drops you in the world and you get the choice of like a fire sword like basically get a weapon on fire.

663
00:47:48,161 --> 00:47:52,820
Rym: So then you go into the town where everybody starts the beginner town and everyone has a sword on fire.

664
00:47:52,880 --> 00:48:04,179
Rym: Literally, there are just like hundreds of people wearing various amounts of like newbie rags Carrying flaming swords running around not interacting in any way clipping through each other.

665
00:48:05,142 --> 00:48:14,718
Scott: Yeah, so this is one thing that I didn't quite grasp until I started playing a bunch of these is that the MMOs are Not massive at all.

666
00:48:15,061 --> 00:48:16,666
Scott: Like they are in no way massive.

667
00:48:16,866 --> 00:48:20,940
Scott: all they are even World of Warcraft even though slightly less so than the others.

668
00:48:21,566 --> 00:48:35,560
Scott: What they do is It's actually just no different than say Counter-strike, right you have a game lobby where people sort of you know Chat while they're waiting to get into a game and when you get into a game, it's just a game.

669
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:36,444
Scott: That's not massive.

670
00:48:36,464 --> 00:48:39,337
Scott: You know, you go to an instance and even you might go to an instance with 30 guys.

671
00:48:39,981 --> 00:48:47,780
Scott: You know if it's a if it's a big, you know I know World of Warcraft has big instances where you bring in a lot of people but it's not massive.

672
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:56,479
Scott: You know, I mean you could play a game of tribes - with that's 40 on 40 or 50 on 50 And that's more massive than that and tribes - doesn't claim to be a massive game.

673
00:48:57,121 --> 00:49:02,880
Scott: So the only massive parts are the lobbies and you know what in a any other game online?

674
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:14,757
Rym: Sure the chat lobby probably has like thousands of people the thing is in D&D online at least the the ways to Interact with people you run into are so minimal and unusable and chat with them.

675
00:49:14,817 --> 00:49:27,560
Scott: You can trade with them The chat and even trade with them because half your items all your good ones Anyway are stuck to you and you can't possibly give them to anyone else because they're bound to only your character and no other character.

676
00:49:27,822 --> 00:49:30,180
Rym: Well even worse I keep saying worse.

677
00:49:30,922 --> 00:49:36,905
Rym: You try to like interact with people and you get this tiny little chat box and you can't read anything That's going on in it.

678
00:49:37,227 --> 00:49:39,360
Rym: And even if you talk to people no one ever responds.

679
00:49:39,701 --> 00:49:41,591
Scott: It's basically only people you can really talk to.

680
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:46,899
Scott: are the people that you friend or in your clan Which is like why does it even matter if these other people are here or not?

681
00:49:47,321 --> 00:49:48,145
Rym: Yeah, it doesn't at all.

682
00:49:48,165 --> 00:49:49,591
Rym: You don't interact with these people in any way.

683
00:49:49,612 --> 00:49:51,420
Rym: you go into like the inn expecting some flavor.

684
00:49:51,461 --> 00:49:53,000
Scott: There's just decorations in the town.

685
00:49:53,221 --> 00:49:59,129
Rym: I went into the inn to seek you don't mind the thing I used to do a lot and old MMOs was like hang out In places with cool people.

686
00:49:59,249 --> 00:50:01,359
Scott: I would do that all the time even in tiny muds.

687
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:05,893
Scott: You could go to like a tavern sit down, you know, have a drink, you know.

688
00:50:05,933 --> 00:50:08,080
Scott: sit in a chair talk to the bartender.

689
00:50:08,241 --> 00:50:09,164
Scott: He would say funny things.

690
00:50:09,184 --> 00:50:10,107
Scott: I walk into the inn.

691
00:50:10,368 --> 00:50:13,439
Scott: people would come in sit down have a drink and talk to you.

692
00:50:13,821 --> 00:50:18,400
Scott: You could play like cards while you talked about, you know in character kind of stuff.

693
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:28,271
Rym: I go into the inn in D&D online and there are literally like a hundred newbies in newbie rags with flaming swords Jumping up and down on the tables and behind the bar.

694
00:50:28,632 --> 00:50:29,535
Rym: You can't sit down.

695
00:50:29,836 --> 00:50:30,960
Rym: You can't do anything special.

696
00:50:31,381 --> 00:50:36,820
Rym: It's just a room with idiot shit cocking newbies jumping up and down with flaming swords.

697
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:43,460
Scott: 90% of the people are just basically crowding around the bartender who gives you quests and he's saying the same exact thing.

698
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:44,143
Scott: He's not moving.

699
00:50:44,184 --> 00:50:45,832
Scott: He's saying the same exact thing to everyone.

700
00:50:46,154 --> 00:50:47,199
Scott: He's not even really an NPC.

701
00:50:47,641 --> 00:50:50,637
Scott: He's basically just a button you click on to get a quest.

702
00:50:50,657 --> 00:50:53,359
Rym: He's like those dispensers in Bioshock.

703
00:50:54,284 --> 00:50:55,188
Scott: Yeah, basically he's.

704
00:50:55,208 --> 00:50:55,470
Scott: he's.

705
00:50:55,671 --> 00:50:57,479
Scott: uh, you know, he's a circus of value.

706
00:51:00,761 --> 00:51:15,783
Rym: It's so ludicrous and laughable that the situations I ran into playing this game were on the level of what I would say about like if I was making fun of an MMO that didn't exist like if I was parodying how bad an MMO could be.

707
00:51:15,883 --> 00:51:22,489
Scott: but so it's like all I have to do to make what game caught an MMO and get people to pay a monthly fee for it and pay real money for it.

708
00:51:22,589 --> 00:51:34,235
Scott: instead of just making my game a one-time fee game is Instead of the chat team, you know matchup Lobby being a chat room I make it like a place to 3d avatar chat room and suddenly I can charge money for it.

709
00:51:34,316 --> 00:51:37,299
Scott: Holy crap, you know What is Yahoo doing with their backgammon?

710
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:44,845
Scott: There's like a thousands of people playing Yahoo backgammon in any one moment if they just made the matchup chat Lobby Have avatars.

711
00:51:44,865 --> 00:51:46,269
Rym: I have to do one thing further.

712
00:51:46,309 --> 00:51:47,112
Rym: You have to level up.

713
00:51:47,393 --> 00:51:48,295
Rym: Yeah, I'm level eight.

714
00:51:48,456 --> 00:51:52,780
Rym: I get to roll three Leveling in backgammon on Yahoo.

715
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:58,280
Scott: You basically you start off with like some number of points and when you lose you lose points and when you win you get points.

716
00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:03,716
Rym: No, no, I'm talking about leveling in the bunging style of I'm level 80.

717
00:52:03,716 --> 00:52:04,037
Rym: I roll 3d6.

718
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:07,485
Scott: Ahh, 3d6 in backgammon.

719
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:17,489
Rym: I get flaming sword In backgammon?

720
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:20,225
Scott: Yeah, in backgammon You're playing hearts.

721
00:52:20,386 --> 00:52:22,734
Scott: You're just like yeah, I can throw out any heart I want.

722
00:52:22,754 --> 00:52:23,456
Rym: No playing hearts.

723
00:52:23,476 --> 00:52:24,600
Rym: I'm like Siobhan dragon.

724
00:52:25,563 --> 00:52:27,096
Rym: Yeah, follow that suit bitches.

725
00:52:31,463 --> 00:52:33,020
Rym: That's basically what's going on though.

726
00:52:33,341 --> 00:52:38,240
Scott: So the worst part like at least I was you know, I was bashing the MMOs for the grindy parts.

727
00:52:38,381 --> 00:52:42,180
Scott: I didn't realize there were all these other horrible parts to them, you know.

728
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:49,512
Scott: And the thing is World of Warcraft to its credit does not have half of these horrible other things But it does have the other.

729
00:52:49,573 --> 00:53:03,265
Rym: In D&D Online We both leveled up a bit and tried to like play on our own and after I failed to have like No one I talked to in that game who was a real PC passed the Turing test Like they did.

730
00:53:03,466 --> 00:53:04,028
Rym: I'm not kid.

731
00:53:04,068 --> 00:53:05,254
Rym: they did not pass the Turing test.

732
00:53:05,274 --> 00:53:06,640
Rym: I was not convinced they were real people.

733
00:53:07,104 --> 00:53:11,106
Rym: So finally Scott and I were like, all right Let's play on the same round.

734
00:53:11,327 --> 00:53:12,712
Rym: and we made sure we're in the same round.

735
00:53:13,074 --> 00:53:15,694
Rym: and I'm like, I'm hanging out by the docks Come find me.

736
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:22,060
Rym: We'll join up a former party and it will go kick some ass multiplayer.

737
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:28,160
Rym: So I'm standing on the docks and Scott has to make an all-new character because it won't let him like join my realm.

738
00:53:28,261 --> 00:53:29,340
Rym: He can't transfer his character.

739
00:53:29,988 --> 00:53:35,199
Rym: So he makes a character And goes through the bullshit starter quest again that you can't die in.

740
00:53:35,561 --> 00:53:42,760
Rym: Literally, but the priest is like I cast a spell on you that makes you immune to death until you leave this dungeon.

741
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:43,522
Rym: It's like great.

742
00:53:44,064 --> 00:53:45,529
Scott: Why did you cast that on everyone?

743
00:53:45,569 --> 00:53:48,960
Scott: and then let's just you know, sort of walk through here lazily.

744
00:53:50,164 --> 00:53:51,560
Rym: Why don't I just learn that spell?

745
00:53:52,421 --> 00:53:56,910
Rym: Yeah, right Anyway, so I'm by the docks and Scott's like.

746
00:53:57,251 --> 00:53:57,692
Rym: I'm here.

747
00:53:57,792 --> 00:53:58,334
Rym: Where are you?

748
00:53:58,394 --> 00:53:59,398
Rym: and I'm like, I'm here.

749
00:53:59,478 --> 00:53:59,960
Rym: Where are you?

750
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:06,462
Rym: I'm the elf in the chain mail with the flaming sword jumping up and down on the barrel next to the other elf with the Flaming sword.

751
00:54:07,084 --> 00:54:10,374
Scott: I'm next to NPC so-and-so jumping up and down.

752
00:54:10,394 --> 00:54:13,304
Rym: I'm next to NPC so-and-so I'm jumping up and down.

753
00:54:13,585 --> 00:54:14,850
Rym: You sure we're at the same dock.

754
00:54:15,151 --> 00:54:26,099
Rym: So I don't see you fast forward 20 fucking minutes later Cuz I like logged out and logged back in and make sure we were in the same realm.

755
00:54:26,881 --> 00:54:27,905
Scott: Definitely in the same realm.

756
00:54:28,026 --> 00:54:31,200
Rym: I went around looking for like another doc cuz I thought you were stupid.

757
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,860
Rym: I thought you were like at some other doc that I didn't know about like way off somewhere.

758
00:54:35,364 --> 00:54:37,420
Rym: So I was like, this is bullshit Scott's an idiot.

759
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:47,746
Rym: Finally in the upper left hand corner, if you click on something, it's like which instance of This town are you in?

760
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:48,569
Rym: and there are three.

761
00:54:48,589 --> 00:54:50,114
Rym: and it's not only.

762
00:54:50,134 --> 00:54:58,400
Scott: not only is the game not actually Massive and the only massive part is a chat lobby that happens to be 3d with avatars, right?

763
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:11,559
Scott: But that chat lobby isn't even that massive because there's multiples of the same exact town and you know There's basically ten copies of the same town and you pick which of the ten copies of the town that you're in.

764
00:55:13,027 --> 00:55:17,569
Rym: Seriously Never mind you have to pay for.

765
00:55:18,152 --> 00:55:22,888
Rym: D&D online is Unplayable at least the reason it's free.

766
00:55:22,908 --> 00:55:28,630
Rym: All right, at least gun bound was fun as a game That's true.

767
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:29,860
Rym: That's true.

768
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:31,505
Rym: I mean I could punish people.

769
00:55:31,565 --> 00:55:32,830
Rym: that's that's more than I can save.

770
00:55:33,271 --> 00:55:38,387
Rym: and the clipping like the game you like it lets you jump But it doesn't let you jump on anything.

771
00:55:38,447 --> 00:55:45,578
Rym: because if you jump on something either it has no effect on the game or They don't actually jump on it because it would break the game.

772
00:55:46,281 --> 00:55:46,863
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

773
00:55:46,883 --> 00:55:52,700
Scott: why even give the ability to jump if there is no platforming aspect to this game whatsoever?

774
00:55:53,182 --> 00:55:57,099
Rym: I mean I would jump and I'd see like a low fence and I couldn't jump over it.

775
00:55:57,722 --> 00:56:07,040
Scott: Yeah, also if the game, you know, it's like you look at the way the game mechanics are right in the way You know, it's sort of like this sort of real-time but poor kind of you know thing.

776
00:56:07,841 --> 00:56:08,484
Scott: It's sort of like.

777
00:56:08,504 --> 00:56:11,780
Scott: well, why do you why are you limiting me in these ways for no reason?

778
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:15,660
Scott: Like for example, like, you know, you know when you play hero quest, right?

779
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:19,120
Scott: You know, we sort of realized like why bother rolling the dice to walk around?

780
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:28,180
Rym: That was the day when we're playing hero quest and Alex was the game master and he was you know He was beating us a little bit partly because the first time we played Scott ran around opening all the doors.

781
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:30,374
Rym: So the cast nights came out in mass.

782
00:56:30,837 --> 00:56:31,280
Scott: It's more fun.

783
00:56:32,742 --> 00:56:36,520
Rym: So then we're like, let's play again and Alex is like, alright and we get it.

784
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:53,914
Rym: We're like, we're gonna open a door and then I turn to Alex and I'm like we stand here and take no action Until all of us roll six for our movement in the same round Mm-hmm, and he's like Fuck.

785
00:56:57,462 --> 00:57:06,074
Scott: His choices were either a force us to go with our first roll Right be force us to actually keep rolling until we got what we wanted

786
00:57:06,094 --> 00:57:07,939
Rym: which I was I was totally willing to do

787
00:57:08,602 --> 00:57:17,399
Scott: yeah, which is technically I think what is required by the rules or be given and Allow us to proceed which of course also ruined the game but in a different way.

788
00:57:18,466 --> 00:57:22,058
Rym: But D&D online comes pre ruined That's true.

789
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:23,182
Rym: There's.

790
00:57:23,243 --> 00:57:26,720
Rym: there was no at any point an element of gameplay.

791
00:57:27,202 --> 00:57:40,593
Rym: You couldn't even say like Wow, you can at least explore the landscape because there's stuff out there and while you can't Wow to its credit, you know The number one thing of all the comparisons to make between Wow and the other MMOs.

792
00:57:41,215 --> 00:57:42,740
Scott: Wow had colors.

793
00:57:43,362 --> 00:57:47,260
Scott: Wow was really colorful and had way better art than any of these.

794
00:57:47,461 --> 00:57:48,284
Scott: I mean the Lord of the Rings.

795
00:57:48,405 --> 00:57:51,358
Scott: one was basically had some colors, but it wasn't great.

796
00:57:51,379 --> 00:58:10,116
Scott: and D&D online is just Bright a brown and gray screen and that's it except for the flaming swords and The high-level characters had colors like the ones that you know The NPCs in the noob quest that you know, the base of the tutorial quest.

797
00:58:10,357 --> 00:58:14,291
Scott: they had colors But there were no other colors in the game whatsoever.

798
00:58:14,452 --> 00:58:18,892
Scott: It was just brown and gray and it's like wow You know World of Warcraft has lots of colors.

799
00:58:18,953 --> 00:58:20,159
Scott: It's at least fun to look at.

800
00:58:20,905 --> 00:58:24,340
Rym: But D&D online is so shit.

801
00:58:25,122 --> 00:58:32,219
Rym: But there's so many people playing it and I think it just proves that punk kids if something's free will do it.

802
00:58:33,043 --> 00:58:35,480
Scott: Well, no, it's not just that it's free that they'll do it.

803
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:47,200
Scott: It's free and it has this psychological thing where they're leveling up in the whole business Right and they have plenty of free time on their hands and nothing to do and they are bored out of there.

804
00:58:47,301 --> 00:58:48,570
Rym: Yeah, some guy came up to me.

805
00:58:48,590 --> 00:58:56,818
Rym: He was like level 18 And he was like, I want to grind the blah blah blah quest on expert mode a bunch of times today.

806
00:58:56,878 --> 00:58:57,519
Rym: Who's with me?

807
00:58:59,401 --> 00:59:03,011
Rym: And I was like, I'm level 7 and he's like, that's fine.

808
00:59:03,071 --> 00:59:15,052
Rym: I'll power level you you blah blah blah and As far as I can tell that dude was sitting there all day Playing the same quest over and over again the quest by the way consisted of Holding down a button and walking.

809
00:59:15,133 --> 00:59:16,521
Rym: Oh, this was the one quest We did.

810
00:59:16,561 --> 00:59:17,123
Rym: we're literally.

811
00:59:17,143 --> 00:59:21,839
Rym: you walk into one room and then these specters just keep coming out of the walls until you kill them all.

812
00:59:22,762 --> 00:59:23,344
Scott: Oh that one.

813
00:59:23,364 --> 00:59:24,108
Rym: Yeah that one.

814
00:59:24,610 --> 00:59:30,140
Scott: Yeah, I guess if you're gonna do some power leveling That's a good one to do because I could have beaten that one with the drinking bird.

815
00:59:36,962 --> 00:59:38,989
Scott: That's like the can of coke the place you give.

816
00:59:39,170 --> 00:59:41,699
Rym: oh Mike no to be fair that kind of coke.

817
00:59:42,262 --> 00:59:44,634
Rym: Yeah, while it won the tournament it was vanilla coke.

818
00:59:44,694 --> 00:59:45,759
Rym: I mean I couldn't even beat that.

819
00:59:46,381 --> 00:59:46,763
Scott: I don't think.

820
00:59:46,783 --> 00:59:48,029
Scott: did it actually win the tournament.

821
00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:49,295
Rym: It came in second place.

822
00:59:49,355 --> 00:59:50,480
Rym: I recall or something like that.

823
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:51,364
Rym: So people know

824
00:59:51,524 --> 01:00:05,720
Scott: right to prove Yu-Gi-Oh the card game right to prove that this game Like, you know in Magic the Gathering if I just take some Magic the Gathering cards and I get the best cards in the world Right the most expensive best cards and I play but I have no clue what I'm doing

825
01:00:06,243 --> 01:00:07,168
Rym: I could lose, you

826
01:00:07,530 --> 01:00:09,460
Scott: know, I might not play any land at all.

827
01:00:09,581 --> 01:00:14,120
Scott: I might just go doo doo doo doo doo, you know and lose in Yu-Gi-Oh, right?

828
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:18,813
Scott: They basically proved that it only matters what cards you have.

829
01:00:19,114 --> 01:00:21,460
Scott: the decisions you make in the game don't mean anything.

830
01:00:21,561 --> 01:00:23,720
Rym: Yep, there's our friend Luke and they were a millennium for a tournament.

831
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:28,040
Rym: So they got the store to provide basically all the absolute best most expensive cards.

832
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:37,937
Rym: They made the best egg you can make and they gave the cat the 20 ounce or 20 Yeah, 20 ounce bottle of vanilla coke the rule that every round it would draw card and play the card and drew.

833
01:00:37,957 --> 01:00:38,379
Rym: and that was it.

834
01:00:39,041 --> 01:00:43,440
Scott: Yep, so I mean they had the best Yu-Gi-Oh cards in the world because the store it's a game store.

835
01:00:43,481 --> 01:00:44,880
Scott: They have every Yu-Gi-Oh card, right?

836
01:00:45,341 --> 01:00:49,540
Scott: So every turn it drew a card and played it and it had the best cards in the world.

837
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:53,623
Scott: It just won and it was a can of coke Vanilla coke.

838
01:00:54,226 --> 01:00:56,840
Scott: vanilla coke beat a whole bunch of people at Yu-Gi-Oh.

839
01:00:56,860 --> 01:00:58,920
Scott: I don't know if it won but it beat a whole bunch of people at you.

840
01:00:59,021 --> 01:01:01,620
Scott: I have to imagine D&D online is the same thing.

841
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:07,639
Scott: You have a drinking bird that just pecks at your attack button and if you're on that quest with the ghosts, you're gonna win.

842
01:01:09,161 --> 01:01:14,567
Rym: I don't even know like I want to make fun of the game, but it's so literally What game?

843
01:01:14,648 --> 01:01:15,579
Scott: What game are you making fun of?

844
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:23,619
Rym: A bunch of identical gray characters with flaming swords jumping up and down in the inn yelling at each other about.

845
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:25,213
Rym: I don't even know what they're yelling.

846
01:01:25,233 --> 01:01:27,343
Rym: They're just typing Gibberish.

847
01:01:27,403 --> 01:01:30,015
Rym: the talking in that game is on the level of a YouTube comment.

848
01:01:30,356 --> 01:01:31,100
Rym: There's nothing there.

849
01:01:31,281 --> 01:01:32,266
Scott: I have a prediction though.

850
01:01:32,286 --> 01:01:33,633
Scott: I have a prediction here and I want to.

851
01:01:33,714 --> 01:01:34,800
Scott: I want to sort of you know.

852
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:37,134
Scott: Get people off our backs preemptively right.

853
01:01:37,174 --> 01:01:42,093
Scott: people are gonna say You were just playing the beginning part of the game where the nubs are.

854
01:01:42,594 --> 01:01:46,460
Scott: if you go to and they're gonna say this for all The MMO is not just D&D online, right?

855
01:01:46,981 --> 01:01:51,838
Scott: If you level up and you go to the later parts of the game where the better content is, right?

856
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:53,424
Scott: It's not like that.

857
01:01:53,464 --> 01:01:55,271
Scott: this good stuff elsewhere in the game.

858
01:01:55,331 --> 01:01:57,520
Scott: You just didn't get there yet, you know.

859
01:01:57,781 --> 01:01:59,808
Scott: So the game isn't crap.

860
01:01:59,848 --> 01:02:01,756
Scott: this good stuff is just not where you were.

861
01:02:01,816 --> 01:02:02,840
Scott: you didn't go to the good stuff.

862
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:05,188
Rym: Well, there's one way around that in D&D online.

863
01:02:05,228 --> 01:02:09,080
Rym: You can just buy your way to the quote-unquote good part.

864
01:02:10,005 --> 01:02:10,909
Scott: Yes, sorry.

865
01:02:10,969 --> 01:02:13,160
Rym: No, but it cuts it with real money.

866
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:16,120
Rym: You can just buy all the levels you want by the class you want and you're good to go.

867
01:02:16,321 --> 01:02:19,279
Scott: If I could just pick my level for free, that would be okay.

868
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:22,379
Scott: But paying real money not okay.

869
01:02:24,161 --> 01:02:25,925
Rym: But everything is work aft right.

870
01:02:26,025 --> 01:02:27,208
Scott: people make the same argument.

871
01:02:27,228 --> 01:02:30,035
Scott: They're like someone told me like yeah, they haven't.

872
01:02:30,456 --> 01:02:33,202
Scott: you know that that content You know.

873
01:02:33,403 --> 01:02:37,220
Scott: at the at the you know, the noob content basically hasn't changed ever.

874
01:02:37,461 --> 01:02:38,688
Scott: That's at least if they're like.

875
01:02:38,769 --> 01:02:52,000
Rym: all the new content is like, you know in the end of the there is a valid argument for Wow that at least there is evidence that The content in the later game is probably objectively better because it's much newer and they haven't revamped the beginning of the game.

876
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:53,325
Rym: But that is possible.

877
01:02:53,405 --> 01:02:56,898
Rym: However, well, let's just talk about D&D online D&D online.

878
01:02:56,918 --> 01:03:02,796
Rym: there The beginning content is not that much older than whatever new content they have.

879
01:03:02,857 --> 01:03:09,497
Rym: if there even is new content There is no indication at all that the game is in any way different at any point in the game ever.

880
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:10,500
Scott: That's true.

881
01:03:11,502 --> 01:03:20,280
Scott: The thing is regardless of whether the content that is later in the game is good or not You know if they get content at the beginning of the game is bad, right?

882
01:03:21,283 --> 01:03:22,199
Scott: Then the game is bad.

883
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:30,815
Scott: I mean if you're playing Mario 1, right and Basically, the only good levels in Mario 1 is world 8 and worlds 1 through 7 or shit.

884
01:03:30,896 --> 01:03:40,600
Scott: or even if worlds 1 through 4 Are bad and worlds 5 through 8 are good Is it worth suffering worlds 1 through 4 just to play worlds 5 through 8?

885
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:50,500
Scott: When there are other games that exist where worlds 1 through 8 are all good Why would I ever play the game that is half bad or has a bad part in the beginning or has any badness?

886
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:50,620
Scott: that?

887
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:52,568
Scott: Requires me to suffer through it whatsoever.

888
01:03:52,669 --> 01:03:54,356
Scott: Even if it was just world 1 - 1 was bad.

889
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:59,975
Scott: See at least at least with why would I suffer when I can just play?

890
01:04:00,055 --> 01:04:06,037
Scott: I don't know new Super Mario Brothers We that's coming out this week where the whole thing is probably gonna be kind of fun at least with Wow.

891
01:04:06,117 --> 01:04:08,645
Rym: in the early content There's a lot more to be said.

892
01:04:08,685 --> 01:04:08,966
Rym: like there.

893
01:04:09,147 --> 01:04:13,280
Rym: there is a I. we can actually review it because there is a game that happens.

894
01:04:13,883 --> 01:04:14,647
Scott: But yes, it's.

895
01:04:14,727 --> 01:04:16,115
Rym: it is far better than the other.

896
01:04:16,275 --> 01:04:22,140
Rym: but D&D online No, I'm saying D&D online There's like nothing.

897
01:04:22,521 --> 01:04:31,948
Rym: It's kind of like when they were trying and penny arcade to make fun of doom 3 and doom 3 had like the art Like the upside down flaming skull And it's like.

898
01:04:31,968 --> 01:04:32,999
Rym: what do you say about that?

899
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:39,720
Scott: Yeah, it's like it's like if I was gonna score these games on a score of 0 to 10, right?

900
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:40,663
Scott: It's like the D&D online.

901
01:04:40,683 --> 01:04:50,430
Scott: we get a 0 because it's just poop all the way through and the World of Warcraft would get like A3 or three and a half, you know, it's like it's still not good But you know, there's far.

902
01:04:50,531 --> 01:04:52,039
Scott: it's pretty much the best of all the MMOs.

903
01:04:52,961 --> 01:05:00,195
Scott: Yeah, and if you were putting it if you're in ranking only MMOs so the best MMO in the world was 10 and the worst MMO in the world was 0.

904
01:05:00,195 --> 01:05:04,621
Scott: World of Warcraft would be 10 and All these other things would be 0.

905
01:05:04,621 --> 01:05:09,357
Scott: Well, I guess even then D&D online wouldn't be 0 because I was actually able to complete some quests.

906
01:05:09,678 --> 01:05:14,040
Scott: Yes Runners would be 0 because it was absolutely unplayable.

907
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:19,991
Rym: You know, it can't be 0 because I was able to log into it And that's already more than many of the games.

908
01:05:20,011 --> 01:05:20,734
Rym: I tried to play.

909
01:05:20,754 --> 01:05:21,820
Rym: That's true.

910
01:05:24,163 --> 01:05:27,400
Rym: The thing is it's all okay because there'll be a constant stream of MMOs.

911
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:30,274
Rym: I mean actually there's a sequel to Eve online coming.

912
01:05:30,314 --> 01:05:31,178
Rym: that might be good.

913
01:05:31,701 --> 01:05:38,236
Scott: Are they gonna get rid of Eve online and go with the sequel only know Microsoft's making and it's called office 2010.

914
01:05:38,236 --> 01:05:44,929
Rym: Oh It's all moot.

915
01:05:45,171 --> 01:05:54,500
Rym: one of my co-workers totally I'm not even kidding took the day after left 4 dead comes out off work to play it all day with his friend.

916
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:56,862
Scott: thought About doing that for Team Fortress 2. good thing We did.

917
01:05:56,943 --> 01:06:04,180
Rym: Oh my if I had done that for Team Fortress 2 I would have been the saddest panda that had ever especially since you didn't come out like most of the day.

918
01:06:04,361 --> 01:06:06,060
Rym: I know you have to take the next day off.

919
01:06:07,321 --> 01:06:08,787
Rym: Left 4 Dead 2 might have been worth it.

920
01:06:09,470 --> 01:06:11,900
Rym: NS is definitely gonna be worth it the day that game comes out.

921
01:06:11,941 --> 01:06:13,861
Rym: I'm not going to work Really?

922
01:06:13,921 --> 01:06:14,363
Rym: Wow.

923
01:06:14,663 --> 01:06:16,609
Rym: Yeah, cuz this is my last hope.

924
01:06:16,930 --> 01:06:20,600
Rym: I waited like a decade for Team Fortress 2 and it fucked me.

925
01:06:21,304 --> 01:06:27,282
Rym: NS is the last thing I got Mmm, and if it fails come out on a weekend We won't have to take.

926
01:06:27,423 --> 01:06:34,788
Rym: if NS 2 fails like basically will make the NS 1 mod and if that fails We'll just play NS 1.

927
01:06:34,788 --> 01:06:41,272
Rym: Forever Will be the mode will be the worst gaming podcast ever like the year 2040 look.

928
01:06:41,312 --> 01:06:41,573
Rym: Yep.

929
01:06:42,074 --> 01:06:43,177
Rym: I was playing some NS 1 today.

930
01:06:45,781 --> 01:06:48,231
Rym: Yep, maybe we'll start even going more retro.

931
01:06:48,252 --> 01:06:55,503
Rym: We'll be playing like NS 1 version 1 point whatever with babblers instead of 3.2.

932
01:06:55,503 --> 01:06:57,111
Scott: You know, well, you like the babblers.

933
01:06:57,311 --> 01:06:58,296
Scott: It's not actually good.

934
01:06:58,316 --> 01:06:59,079
Rym: They weren't good.

935
01:06:59,361 --> 01:07:03,040
Rym: Hey more than once I killed myself or my own hive with those things.

936
01:07:04,101 --> 01:07:06,934
Scott: More than once most of the time I used a babbler.

937
01:07:07,035 --> 01:07:09,324
Rym: if you drop the babbler I suppose to an enemy.

938
01:07:09,444 --> 01:07:15,783
Rym: if you were like running forward too quickly and you throw a babbler it just sat in you and ate you Yep.

939
01:07:16,308 --> 01:07:17,359
Rym: Oh, those were good times.

940
01:07:18,383 --> 01:07:18,848
Scott: We should make.

941
01:07:18,989 --> 01:07:23,109
Scott: put the babblers in the MMOs And I don't mean like you're in the MMO.

942
01:07:23,170 --> 01:07:25,480
Scott: You're playing the game and you click a button and babblers come out.

943
01:07:25,580 --> 01:07:30,160
Scott: I mean like, you know, we take babblers and we put them in the offices of all the people who make the MMOs.

944
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:34,696
