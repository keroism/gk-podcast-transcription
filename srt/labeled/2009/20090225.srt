Scott: late July August is ConnectiCon.

21
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,659
Rym: It's hard to tell because kinetic ons website is broken again.

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,784
Scott: No, but no.

23
00:01:23,824 --> 00:01:24,526
Scott: so it's like.

24
00:01:24,566 --> 00:01:25,831
Scott: that's the con season.

25
00:01:25,851 --> 00:01:28,620
Scott: now the thing is there are cons all year.

26
00:01:28,802 --> 00:01:35,859
Scott: They're always con somewhere in the world Somewhere in the u.s.. There's a con pretty much every month at least probably more than one every month.

27
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:44,526
Rym: yes But in the Northeast in the summer is when most of the anime cons are that are big for geek Conventions all in the u.s..

28
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:44,787
Scott: It's.

29
00:01:44,968 --> 00:01:48,339
Scott: but from late July to early September is when all the cons are.

30
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:48,700
Rym: yes.

31
00:01:49,382 --> 00:01:51,710
Rym: So there is a con season, and it's rapidly approaching.

32
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:52,734
Scott: I don't know.

33
00:01:52,774 --> 00:01:58,476
Rym: July is a little bit away It's already a lot away and come May we have to start going to these cons.

34
00:01:59,038 --> 00:02:01,668
Scott: Yeah It's not con season though in May.

35
00:02:01,809 --> 00:02:04,640
Scott: It's just a con in May - maybe more cons.

36
00:02:04,881 --> 00:02:07,549
Scott: Two cons in May, I don't know if I can do two in May.

37
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:09,741
Rym: I Don't know.

38
00:02:09,761 --> 00:02:13,359
Rym: I'm pretty much looking at a B. Oh - con ConnectiCon fax.

39
00:02:14,521 --> 00:02:15,484
Scott: All right sure.

40
00:02:15,504 --> 00:02:17,612
Rym: wow you're so enthusiastic.

41
00:02:17,632 --> 00:02:18,394
Rym: Maybe we shouldn't bother.

42
00:02:18,595 --> 00:02:19,799
Rym: all right sure okay?

43
00:02:20,942 --> 00:02:21,448
Scott: We don't go.

44
00:02:21,468 --> 00:02:22,258
Scott: I'll do something else.

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,611
Rym: Regardless we are actually.

46
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:31,758
Rym: I figure I'll announce it now even though It's a little early because there have been many rumors about whether or not we will ever appear at anime, Boston.

47
00:02:31,798 --> 00:02:34,768
Rym: people have been asking Us for like the last four years every year.

48
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:35,531
Rym: They're like hey.

49
00:02:35,953 --> 00:02:37,177
Rym: Are you going to anime, Boston?

50
00:02:37,378 --> 00:02:37,980
Rym: and every year?

51
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,208
Rym: It's like yeah, oh wait.

52
00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:39,430
Rym: No.

53
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:48,413
Rym: It's the same time as some other con We go to or or they remind us like right before the con is about to happen like hey You guys doing a panel in anime, Boston.

54
00:02:48,453 --> 00:02:49,400
Rym: Yeah, what is it see?

55
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:56,349
Scott: I mean if you're deciding whether you're gonna go to a convention or not as an attendee You can decide like a week or two in advance.

56
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,900
Scott: well unless you don't need that much advance notice.

57
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,199
Rym: Well you do for a lot of the big East cons because the hotels sell out and the tickets sell out.

58
00:03:03,279 --> 00:03:13,324
Scott: well Yeah, yeah, but you know really I mean Otakon you need the hotel But you know you can take it just to point out kids if you don't already have your hotel room for Otakon You're probably screwed.

59
00:03:13,705 --> 00:03:13,866
Rym: No

60
00:03:13,886 --> 00:03:17,597
Scott: you could probably get one now, but it'd be rough, and you'd be shitty

61
00:03:17,818 --> 00:03:18,119
Rym: yeah,

62
00:03:18,279 --> 00:03:33,320
Scott: but anyway the No, but if you are actually gonna do something at a convention Maybe artists alley maybe a dealer room Maybe some panels that kind of thing you basically need like almost a year advance notice.

63
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:40,395
Scott: So if you come up to us like a few weeks in advance like hey go to anime, Boston in a few weeks It's like too late to remind us.

64
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:45,497
Rym: guys You know we could obviate that problem by simply remembering when cons are

65
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:47,123
Scott: yeah Yeah, the real

66
00:03:47,163 --> 00:03:56,039
Rym: problem with anime, Boston was that literally every year for the past like seven years when I thought man I'd love to go to anime, Boston something was on that same weekend every time.

67
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:56,863
Scott: I don't know.

68
00:03:56,883 --> 00:03:59,353
Scott: I don't remember something being on the weekend last time.

69
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:00,478
Rym: I had stuff on the weekend.

70
00:04:00,498 --> 00:04:01,722
Rym: It wasn't cons It was just stuff.

71
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:05,637
Rym: just places did things like every year something came up sometimes.

72
00:04:05,697 --> 00:04:06,199
Rym: It was con.

73
00:04:06,219 --> 00:04:07,694
Rym: sometimes It was other stuff mm-hmm.

74
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,528
Rym: But the stars are in alignment this year.

75
00:04:10,588 --> 00:04:14,320
Rym: because you might remember last year anime, Boston had some trouble with the registration.

76
00:04:14,581 --> 00:04:28,777
Rym: It made all the news and we commented on it, and it just so happens that a good friend of ours Works with the anime Boston panels and programming staff And he was like hey you guys should come to anime, Boston, and I was like you know what.

77
00:04:29,219 --> 00:04:31,475
Rym: yeah Let's fucking do it this time all right.

78
00:04:31,536 --> 00:04:34,914
Scott: Yeah, I mean well We didn't go to Katsucon so to maintain the quota.

79
00:04:35,196 --> 00:04:35,920
Scott: why the fuck not?

80
00:04:37,582 --> 00:04:38,670
Rym: We're still nowhere near.

81
00:04:39,194 --> 00:04:40,000
Rym: we set some records.

82
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,779
Scott: It's also a lot easier for us to get to Boston than it is for us to get to DC.

83
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:48,000
Scott: I don't know, but we know people in DC is like a five-hour drive from here.

84
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,904
Rym: It's really not that bad.

85
00:04:49,005 --> 00:04:51,114
Scott: Boston is a straight shot in 84 East.

86
00:04:51,536 --> 00:04:52,300
Scott: It's real easy.

87
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,309
Rym: He sees a straight shot on 95 south.

88
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,599
Scott: like think about how long it takes us to get to Connecticut.

89
00:04:57,581 --> 00:04:59,388
Scott: It's like two and a half times that.

90
00:04:59,408 --> 00:05:04,063
Rym: so almost as long as it takes to get to DC.

91
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:07,845
Scott: no like slightly longer than half the time It takes to get to DC.

92
00:05:07,885 --> 00:05:11,260
Rym: point out that every year Connecticut takes us almost two hours to get there.

93
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,893
Rym: No, not really it has for the last several years because you remember every year.

94
00:05:14,913 --> 00:05:15,797
Rym: We're like yeah, let's go.

95
00:05:15,817 --> 00:05:17,986
Scott: yeah It doesn't feel that long.

96
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:21,520
Rym: there's no traffic on 84 around 684. this takes like an hour.

97
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,093
Scott: No, there's not gonna be that traffic, but it's been there every year.

98
00:05:25,154 --> 00:05:26,740
Rym: Why is it not gonna be there this time?

99
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,339
Scott: They're gonna leave at a different hour.

100
00:05:28,672 --> 00:05:29,979
Rym: Yeah We're probably went to Connecticut.

101
00:05:30,321 --> 00:05:33,091
Scott: We would always do is be driving on 84 like.

102
00:05:33,111 --> 00:05:34,556
Scott: well other people were getting home from work.

103
00:05:34,597 --> 00:05:39,520
Scott: as we come home early Get in the car and go and thus be on 84 in the going home rush hour.

104
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,086
Rym: That is one thing we go to animate.

105
00:05:41,106 --> 00:05:44,237
Scott: Boston will probably leave on like a Friday morning Thursday night.

106
00:05:44,298 --> 00:05:49,205
Rym: most likely We're gonna head there Thursday during the day, okay We'll see what the situation is.

107
00:05:49,446 --> 00:05:49,606
Rym: well.

108
00:05:49,646 --> 00:05:50,368
Rym: That's what I'm going.

109
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:50,649
Rym: I mean.

110
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,113
Rym: I have vacation days.

111
00:05:52,755 --> 00:05:57,407
Scott: I see I got to see about the days But yes, just quit.

112
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:00,040
Rym: we are most definitely attending anime Boston.

113
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,637
Rym: We're gonna be there guestie whatever and we're at least gonna do anime.

114
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,820
Rym: You should see and know your creators.

115
00:06:07,386 --> 00:06:16,818
Rym: You know all our kind of typical fare And we're gonna do the late show again since we offer that way back to Katsucon is like the Katsucon Exclusive, and you know we didn't go to Katsucon this year.

116
00:06:17,442 --> 00:06:20,615
Rym: So we're gonna see if this is gonna become the anime Boston exclusive.

117
00:06:21,157 --> 00:06:23,470
Scott: all right well We'll keep shopping it around.

118
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,020
Scott: see if anyone's buying.

119
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,613
Scott: Alright that that's all we got for that.

120
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:29,560
Rym: That's all I've got.

121
00:06:30,804 --> 00:06:32,008
Rym: You have anything exciting to say?

122
00:06:32,028 --> 00:06:32,751
Scott: I don't know.

123
00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:35,400
Scott: I thought we were gonna do some more stuff there, but is that not confirmed yet?

124
00:06:35,741 --> 00:06:48,775
Rym: Well, it's not confirmed yet, so I don't want to say anything, but we there may be Two or three other events we do and I should also point out that we Will very likely have the illustrious Daryl Surratt on at least one of our panels.

125
00:06:49,277 --> 00:06:51,102
Scott: if he if he shows up He'll be there.

126
00:06:51,222 --> 00:06:57,360
Scott: Yeah, they're there many possibilities of things in store, but anime Boston is looking extremely likely.

127
00:06:57,662 --> 00:06:58,668
Rym: I already got the hotel room.

128
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:00,319
Rym: We're going alrighty there.

129
00:07:01,381 --> 00:07:02,849
Scott: So is it a nice hotel?

130
00:07:03,211 --> 00:07:03,855
Rym: I have no idea.

131
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:04,800
Rym: I've never been to Boston.

132
00:07:05,563 --> 00:07:09,020
Scott: Great alright, so what's going on in the news world here?

133
00:07:09,622 --> 00:07:13,479
Rym: Low talk of someone who wasn't quite sure what he was gonna say and he was trying to finish out the sentence.

134
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:14,627
Rym: and well He came up with it.

135
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:19,610
Scott: That's right, so Yeah, is that asteroid movie is coming out right?

136
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,296
Scott: the CG one the head little trailer.

137
00:07:21,437 --> 00:07:22,300
Scott: that was looking alright.

138
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,730
Rym: It was delayed in the not delay delayed.

139
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,040
Scott: They got some money not delayed got some money.

140
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,527
Scott: I don't know where the money's coming from.

141
00:07:28,547 --> 00:07:31,140
Scott: I don't know how many people are gonna see it in the bad economy.

142
00:07:31,922 --> 00:07:37,126
Scott: You know I mean there are people who know asteroid, but in the US Really he's got the bad economy.

143
00:07:37,146 --> 00:07:39,875
Rym: from what I've seen movie ticket sales are actually going up.

144
00:07:40,116 --> 00:07:41,059
Scott: That's because the movies are 3d.

145
00:07:42,281 --> 00:07:45,232
Rym: It's not just that it's because it the Oscars was just now.

146
00:07:45,633 --> 00:07:47,460
Rym: the same thing happened during the Great Depression.

147
00:07:47,822 --> 00:07:50,496
Scott: Really, yes, I get to go study that entertainment.

148
00:07:50,918 --> 00:07:55,154
Scott: alright But other forms of entertainment are going down the shitter outside of New York City.

149
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:56,359
Rym: movie theaters are pretty cheap.

150
00:07:57,081 --> 00:07:58,145
Scott: No, it's that's true.

151
00:07:58,165 --> 00:08:00,754
Rym: I mean not everyone pays like 25 bucks to see a movie.

152
00:08:01,115 --> 00:08:02,560
Scott: Yeah, that's that's true alright.

153
00:08:02,942 --> 00:08:09,928
Scott: But anyway Astro Boy movie alright looking pretty likely and IDW is a comic publisher.

154
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,480
Scott: right they publish the Dick Tracy books that I buy.

155
00:08:13,082 --> 00:08:18,380
Scott: They're gonna publish that Bloom County reprint the rims gonna buy cuz he you know he can't get enough of that.

156
00:08:18,561 --> 00:08:20,391
Rym: Well, I already have the first printing.

157
00:08:20,451 --> 00:08:22,000
Rym: I might as well buy the last print.

158
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,640
Scott: Well, it's probably gonna be all fancy like the Dick Tracy one, too.

159
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,631
Scott: It's not gonna be like.

160
00:08:25,691 --> 00:08:31,239
Rym: you know the old one Which is just like my old one is so old like it has stains from my childhood all over it.

161
00:08:32,424 --> 00:08:33,399
Scott: Good reason to buy new.

162
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:38,640
Scott: They also do like Transformers comics and that sort of stuff right there.

163
00:08:38,941 --> 00:08:43,176
Scott: They're pretty high quality comics publisher, and they are gonna do a four at issue.

164
00:08:44,781 --> 00:08:52,340
Scott: Astro Boy miniseries, so it's it's a comic was turned into a movie and other movies turning being back turned back into a comic again.

165
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:58,756
Scott: So I think that's that's gonna be pretty interesting considering IDW is high quality.

166
00:08:58,776 --> 00:09:05,443
Scott: the movie Maybe Astro Boy is high quality, so It.

167
00:09:05,524 --> 00:09:06,830
Scott: I think I'll get the first issue.

168
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,036
Scott: You know or maybe get the tray.

169
00:09:08,076 --> 00:09:08,780
Scott: who knows what I'll do?

170
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,400
Scott: But I'm gonna check it out in some some fat.

171
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,078
Rym: I would definitely say there's a good shot of this coming together in the right way for once.

172
00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:17,892
Scott: yeah The thing is if it's just a comic of the movie.

173
00:09:17,912 --> 00:09:19,540
Scott: Do you really need it if you see the movie?

174
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:32,116
Scott: It's like a lot of times that happens is like they'll make for example right you'll get x-men comics right then We'll make like an x-men movie Okay, and then they'll make x-men comics that are like the movie afterwards.

175
00:09:32,577 --> 00:09:33,981
Scott: at you know after the fact It's like.

176
00:09:34,724 --> 00:09:37,533
Scott: is that really like anyone who reads comics?

177
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,460
Scott: read the x-men comics the movie.

178
00:09:40,144 --> 00:09:42,659
Rym: forget those comics are not meant to be bought by fans.

179
00:09:42,699 --> 00:09:44,686
Rym: the Movie you know.

180
00:09:44,706 --> 00:09:45,468
Rym: those are bought by.

181
00:09:45,909 --> 00:09:47,133
Rym: those are bought by grandma.

182
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:49,440
Rym: who knows that Billy likes the x-man.

183
00:09:49,801 --> 00:09:54,820
Scott: No, that's not possible because these things are only sold in comic book stores or grandma would never be able to go.

184
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:58,392
Rym: They're also bought by collectors who buy them to collect them.

185
00:09:58,673 --> 00:10:01,704
Rym: yeah collectors don't even like that shit All right, then who buys them?

186
00:10:01,745 --> 00:10:02,949
Rym: cuz they clearly make enough money.

187
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:04,656
Scott: I have no idea who buys them.

188
00:10:04,676 --> 00:10:05,560
Scott: That's what I'm asking.

189
00:10:07,022 --> 00:10:08,690
Rym: It's definitely not those people Scott.

190
00:10:08,771 --> 00:10:17,640
Rym: I do see those things in bookstores Maybe but I saw a bookstore on the end cap has like all the comics of popular movies and all that crap together.

191
00:10:17,981 --> 00:10:25,143
Scott: Yeah, I mean at least wing anime and manga section at least with things like Watchmen and 300 or whatever.

192
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:28,132
Scott: right they don't make a comic from the movie from the comic.

193
00:10:28,152 --> 00:10:36,180
Scott: they just the original comic starts selling like crazy and Watchmen is selling stupid crazy like so stupid.

194
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:37,083
Scott: It's like.

195
00:10:37,143 --> 00:10:43,306
Scott: I was looking at some of the numbers just in like the direct market whatever I think was no.

196
00:10:43,346 --> 00:10:44,170
Scott: I think it was just.

197
00:10:45,033 --> 00:10:46,520
Scott: I think that oh, I remember what the number was.

198
00:10:46,600 --> 00:11:00,811
Scott: I think it was in this year if you only count 65% of bookstores that report to book scan which doesn't include Walmart even right it was like Multiple hundreds of thousands.

199
00:11:00,831 --> 00:11:02,320
Scott: I think maybe like six hundred thousand.

200
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:09,100
Scott: It's something the ridiculous number of copies of Watchmen and this thing has been like up high on the list ever since it's been a trade.

201
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:22,819
Scott: so there are millions and millions and millions of copies of Watchmen sold which is like way more than any comic like It's approaching like Dragon Ball shonen jump levels in terms of how many people are buying this thing.

202
00:11:23,181 --> 00:11:26,035
Scott: I don't know how many individual copies one person is buying.

203
00:11:26,075 --> 00:11:27,804
Scott: I bought to See.

204
00:11:28,648 --> 00:11:29,534
Scott: I buy another one.

205
00:11:29,715 --> 00:11:30,519
Rym: I have bought zero.

206
00:11:30,862 --> 00:11:32,233
Rym: Surprisingly enough you know.

207
00:11:32,253 --> 00:11:32,999
Scott: I think you bought one.

208
00:11:33,301 --> 00:11:34,266
Rym: I might have you bought.

209
00:11:34,306 --> 00:11:36,899
Scott: you got the trade that we have is you you bought I did I?

210
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,467
Rym: Have no idea who owns that.

211
00:11:38,627 --> 00:11:39,855
Rym: nor do I know where it is.

212
00:11:40,036 --> 00:11:40,720
Scott: I don't know where it is either.

213
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,115
Scott: That's why I was thinking I buy another one.

214
00:11:44,021 --> 00:11:45,767
Scott: It's good to have because I got the.

215
00:11:45,887 --> 00:11:52,396
Scott: I got about the fancy hardcover one recently not the big absolute stupid one You know just the new regular old hardcover one.

216
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:53,060
Scott: that one's mine.

217
00:11:53,161 --> 00:11:58,397
Scott: But I get a. I get a softcover one You know hand it out pass it around beat it up that sort of thing.

218
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:01,019
Scott: plus It has different colors than the hardcover one.

219
00:12:01,501 --> 00:12:07,579
Scott: So it's good to compare because sometimes colors have some meaning in there, so it's not gonna be just the washed-out dr.

220
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,222
Rym: Manhattan.

221
00:12:08,242 --> 00:12:09,688
Rym: you're gonna get the bright dark blue dr.

222
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:14,726
Scott: Manhattan exactly with his giant giant.

223
00:12:14,766 --> 00:12:16,459
Rym: giant something yeah giant something.

224
00:12:19,223 --> 00:12:22,140
Rym: But on the opposite side of things you know things not doing so well.

225
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:33,000
Rym: I'm sure if you're an anime fan You've seen all the hubbub on the internet that ranges from best buy is dropping their anime selection to best buy dug up Osamu Tezuka, and then stabbed his carbs.

226
00:12:33,526 --> 00:12:34,458
Scott: I doubt either one of them.

227
00:12:34,981 --> 00:12:40,816
Rym: But basically the deal here is that Best Buy is doing what a lot of stars are in this economy.

228
00:12:40,856 --> 00:12:53,149
Rym: It's ours stars Shops in this economy and just in general that if something isn't selling well the agents they restructure How what kind of merchandise their stores carry?

229
00:12:53,169 --> 00:12:59,538
Rym: I mean you think every media play well media plays gone every Circuit City Circuit City's gone.

230
00:13:03,702 --> 00:13:06,574
Rym: But you think like back in the day you'd think every media play was the same.

231
00:13:06,595 --> 00:13:07,398
Rym: you look at a media play.

232
00:13:07,418 --> 00:13:09,185
Rym: you assume That is a media play.

233
00:13:09,385 --> 00:13:13,680
Rym: there are many like it and mine is exactly like all of them, but that wasn't the case.

234
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:22,719
Rym: I mean if you went to the media play near RIT in Rochester They had an anime section that was almost as big as like their cheapo book section in the.

235
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:24,063
Scott: yeah Well, I mean think about it.

236
00:13:24,124 --> 00:13:34,472
Scott: right if you've got say a Best Buy right in I don't know Tennessee Right it's gonna be a lot more country music in the music section.

237
00:13:34,792 --> 00:13:44,800
Scott: right if you got if you got a Best Buy in I don't know Tampa is gonna be a lot more metal in the music section.

238
00:13:45,261 --> 00:13:48,395
Rym: What Best Buy is doing really is they're just.

239
00:13:48,435 --> 00:13:55,660
Rym: they're dividing up Anime into basically titles that sell and titles that only sell to a small number of nerds.

240
00:13:56,242 --> 00:14:03,431
Rym: And they're only going to sell the titles that sell to a small number of nerds in the stores where they know the nerds are And they're not gonna sell them in the rest.

241
00:14:03,471 --> 00:14:04,900
Scott: so in other words smart business.

242
00:14:05,425 --> 00:14:06,435
Rym: Yeah, pretty much so.

243
00:14:06,496 --> 00:14:21,474
Rym: as a result They're actually going to cut anime from from a lot of their stores not cut it entirely But drastically cut down to where you'll only see like the big selling top a titles And you won't see anything else there, and they'll get rid of all the overstock.

244
00:14:21,514 --> 00:14:22,640
Scott: in other words common sense.

245
00:14:23,503 --> 00:14:24,506
Rym: Yeah pretty much see.

246
00:14:24,526 --> 00:14:26,011
Scott: I actually think this is good.

247
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:31,740
Scott: It's sort of a good medicine You know well, it's a bad painful medicine for the anime industry.

248
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,995
Scott: But it's sort of forcing them to do to fix their stupid ways right.

249
00:14:36,055 --> 00:14:37,841
Scott: and that's you know We all.

250
00:14:37,921 --> 00:14:40,008
Scott: everyone always talks about the crap factor right.

251
00:14:40,349 --> 00:14:42,476
Scott: they get all these fucking end right.

252
00:14:42,637 --> 00:14:47,859
Scott: when there weren't enough Anime being brought over to the u.s.. We complained Oh, there's not enough anime over here.

253
00:14:48,181 --> 00:14:52,058
Scott: Then they brought every freaking anime in the known universe over here, and we're like whoa whoa whoa.

254
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,166
Scott: Why are you bringing all the crap over?

255
00:14:54,307 --> 00:14:55,852
Scott: just bring the good stuff.

256
00:14:56,274 --> 00:14:57,719
Scott: leave the crap in Japan?

257
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,531
Rym: I belong like Odine and Crystal Triangle exactly.

258
00:15:01,591 --> 00:15:07,580
Scott: so the thing that's happening and the thing that hurt You know look at this the anime companies bring all this crap over right now.

259
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:17,474
Scott: The thing is when you're a publisher like an anime company Your goal is not to sell DVDs to people But to sell DVDs to media plays and best buys and circuit cities and Amazons.

260
00:15:17,735 --> 00:15:20,211
Scott: as soon as you sell to the retailer You're good now.

261
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,863
Scott: They can Return it.

262
00:15:21,984 --> 00:15:24,392
Scott: it's possible for them to return it to you of course.

263
00:15:24,453 --> 00:15:26,460
Rym: It's not so good that all depends on the agreement.

264
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:31,529
Scott: I mean you can't return all things But usually that stuff is returnable to some degree right.

265
00:15:31,569 --> 00:15:36,140
Scott: it's not like comic bookstores where direct market diamond where it's absolutely non returnable.

266
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:36,501
Scott: Right.

267
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:40,675
Scott: so they can return it somehow, but usually they don't.

268
00:15:40,876 --> 00:15:42,060
Scott: usually go to a Best Buy.

269
00:15:42,201 --> 00:15:49,426
Scott: they got this big shelf right depending on your Best Buy full of everything and They don't really return anything.

270
00:15:49,446 --> 00:15:55,268
Scott: cuz stuff sells new stuff comes in and the only reason to return stuff is if you can't fit All the new stuff on the shelf right.

271
00:15:55,710 --> 00:16:04,891
Scott: so even if like all the DVDs I you know even if you keep selling out of the popular stuff and restocking it and the Non-popular stuff just sits there taking up space.

272
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:11,620
Scott: right you don't really notice until There's a bad economy, and you're really really starting to try to push your profits up.

273
00:16:11,803 --> 00:16:20,119
Rym: You know of course I guess I've noticed going into bookstores and things recently that like in general the manga section and almost every bookstore Has the same?

274
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,710
Rym: Physical stock that it had a year ago.

275
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,459
Rym: like I don't see many new titles.

276
00:16:25,146 --> 00:16:30,549
Rym: I see just the same like Set of whatever sitting there And it just grazed through by the manga cows.

277
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:33,782
Rym: all that like ones are missing and the rest are all sitting there You know.

278
00:16:33,842 --> 00:16:35,150
Scott: because what sells right?

279
00:16:35,331 --> 00:16:36,759
Scott: Naruto bleach?

280
00:16:38,482 --> 00:16:39,046
Scott: What's the?

281
00:16:39,067 --> 00:16:40,378
Scott: what's the one with the?

282
00:16:42,463 --> 00:16:44,690
Rym: I forget it doesn't matter if you can't remember.

283
00:16:45,493 --> 00:16:50,442
Scott: You know you know the Full Metal Alchemist sells Regardless.

284
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,228
Scott: right yeah, you know.

285
00:16:52,288 --> 00:16:55,539
Scott: so why had the other stuff barely sells?

286
00:16:55,599 --> 00:17:03,355
Scott: now I like some of the stuff that barely sells You know but you can always get it from say an Amazon or something like that.

287
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:14,750
Scott: right if you're a retail store Carrying that you know and like the off chance it might sell is Really not good for you even though you know Fans would like you to carry it.

288
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:21,473
Scott: they'd like it to become popular But if it's not you're not making money And you're actually the anime companies are sort of.

289
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:26,099
Scott: you're sort of helping them be Stupid by buying all their crap and putting it on the shelves.

290
00:17:26,601 --> 00:17:37,997
Scott: You're basically making it at least a little bit profitable for them to license crap that no one wants and thus they continue to license Crap that no one wants and sort of dig themselves into the hole that they're in.

291
00:17:38,037 --> 00:17:38,720
Rym: well even band.

292
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,584
Rym: I had this to say.

293
00:17:39,705 --> 00:17:45,539
Rym: quote translated this will be good for the business But it will make it a little harder to sell the less popular titles.

294
00:17:46,303 --> 00:17:49,320
Scott: So just don't do the less popular titles at all.

295
00:17:49,521 --> 00:17:50,385
Rym: But here's the problem.

296
00:17:50,405 --> 00:17:53,560
Rym: even be the internal conundrum of the anime industry in America.

297
00:17:54,303 --> 00:18:08,776
Rym: The more popular a title is in its raw form The less likely the fans are to buy it because popularity tends to come from fan subs and piracy and Then most of the people will watch their bleach or their whatever and that's it.

298
00:18:08,816 --> 00:18:09,700
Rym: They're never gonna buy it.

299
00:18:10,061 --> 00:18:14,500
Scott: It's obviously not true because you know this crazy Naruto scans lations.

300
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,212
Scott: But meanwhile Naruto is the number one selling manga.

301
00:18:17,272 --> 00:18:19,160
Rym: it is, but you look at the comic selling list.

302
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,026
Scott: It's like Watchmen.

303
00:18:20,429 --> 00:18:21,879
Scott: Naruto Naruto Naruto Naruto.

304
00:18:22,281 --> 00:18:24,752
Rym: Yes, but even still the raw numbers are not that high.

305
00:18:24,772 --> 00:18:26,400
Rym: if you look at the you know the book industry.

306
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:27,231
Scott: They're pretty high.

307
00:18:29,122 --> 00:18:31,133
Rym: They're not that high and recently they've been dropping.

308
00:18:31,394 --> 00:18:37,638
Scott: no actually Naruto I think has been on the actual like book list for like every single month all year.

309
00:18:37,718 --> 00:18:39,407
Scott: which list You know like?

310
00:18:39,468 --> 00:18:41,280
Scott: I guess like the book scan whatever whatever?

311
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,307
Scott: I don't you know the Nielsen thing that they.

312
00:18:43,648 --> 00:18:46,277
Scott: so it's the same list that says a bajillion Watchmen's were sold.

313
00:18:46,639 --> 00:18:46,960
Rym: all right.

314
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,466
Rym: So that list the list you can't name.

315
00:18:48,787 --> 00:18:52,300
Scott: yeah, okay, but yet trust me it sells crazy.

316
00:18:52,782 --> 00:18:53,584
Scott: They make shit money.

317
00:18:53,605 --> 00:18:55,210
Scott: you know crazy shit money off it.

318
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:57,157
Scott: not bad good money, but that's the manga.

319
00:18:57,197 --> 00:18:57,960
Rym: what about the anime?

320
00:18:59,182 --> 00:19:00,329
Scott: Anime just doesn't make money.

321
00:19:00,812 --> 00:19:07,615
Rym: That's what I was talking about Because the real issue here is that people especially a show like that.

322
00:19:07,695 --> 00:19:08,759
Rym: It's almost a throwaway show.

323
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,759
Rym: I mean you watch it an episode once you're not gonna watch it again.

324
00:19:12,161 --> 00:19:13,325
Rym: So there's no point in buying it.

325
00:19:13,626 --> 00:19:17,459
Rym: the revenue model in Japan is primarily ads on TV coupled with merchandise.

326
00:19:17,479 --> 00:19:25,739
Rym: in America the merchandise is all crappy secondhand only available to anime cons Especially since media play is gone, and they used to be the ones who really sold all that stuff.

327
00:19:26,284 --> 00:19:40,069
Rym: Yeah, Chris I remember during the anime boom media play had this giant section of like Japanese candy and Japanese toys And they had all the same stuff that was in the dealers rooms at cons and now that they're gone I don't see that in retail stores so much.

328
00:19:40,109 --> 00:19:41,876
Rym: They all have like this tiny selection, and that's it.

329
00:19:42,358 --> 00:19:44,916
Rym: yeah, I Don't know what to do about it.

330
00:19:45,781 --> 00:19:47,148
Scott: Well, it's you know any.

331
00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:50,103
Scott: it's the problem of any niche Interest.

332
00:19:50,163 --> 00:19:55,460
Scott: right if a small number of people really like something right they want it to be available.

333
00:19:55,622 --> 00:19:58,788
Scott: You know they want to be able to get it And they want to be able to you know.

334
00:19:58,949 --> 00:20:02,768
Rym: but at the same time the majority of fans It's not profitable to provide it.

335
00:20:02,848 --> 00:20:04,434
Rym: well the only reason it's not profitable?

336
00:20:04,514 --> 00:20:06,079
Rym: because the majority of the fans who?

337
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:10,136
Rym: Consume most of this media and anime is just one example.

338
00:20:10,156 --> 00:20:11,040
Rym: There are a lot of things like this.

339
00:20:11,784 --> 00:20:20,295
Rym: They like it they enjoy watching it they seek it out They'll spend a little bit of effort getting it But it's not worth paying for or putting any undue effort toward.

340
00:20:20,395 --> 00:20:21,700
Scott: I mean yeah, that's exactly it.

341
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,512
Scott: It's like if you like something right all right.

342
00:20:24,612 --> 00:20:26,500
Scott: You know how much do you like it right?

343
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,769
Scott: It's not just do you like it?

344
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:28,959
Scott: It's how much do you like it?

345
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,104
Scott: You know I mean like.

346
00:20:30,546 --> 00:20:35,989
Scott: if I like something a whole lot like it's my favorite thing in the universe And I want it really badly.

347
00:20:36,571 --> 00:20:37,315
Scott: I'll do a lot.

348
00:20:37,355 --> 00:20:39,858
Scott: I'll pay a lot of money I'll do a lot of work.

349
00:20:40,401 --> 00:20:41,646
Scott: You know just try to get it.

350
00:20:42,128 --> 00:20:45,340
Scott: if I kind of like something like a little bit like yeah, I'd watch that.

351
00:20:46,143 --> 00:20:47,529
Scott: You know I'm not gonna.

352
00:20:48,012 --> 00:20:49,820
Scott: You know that doesn't mean I'm gonna pay money for it.

353
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,644
Scott: I only like it.

354
00:20:50,704 --> 00:20:52,815
Scott: Maybe maybe I'd pay ten cents for it.

355
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:55,561
Scott: You know it's like yeah I like it, but not so much You know.

356
00:20:55,622 --> 00:21:01,589
Scott: and if it wasn't available for ten cents if the only way I could get it was ten bucks I just would go without it.

357
00:21:02,172 --> 00:21:03,338
Scott: You know I don't need it.

358
00:21:04,042 --> 00:21:04,785
Scott: And that's that's.

359
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:11,969
Scott: the thing with anime is that there are very few people who need it bad Right need it bad enough to pay the price that they're charging.

360
00:21:11,989 --> 00:21:15,539
Scott: and that's why you know bandai visual was so in the crapper.

361
00:21:15,579 --> 00:21:22,046
Scott: because They're basically like yeah, let's go for the people who really want it bad want it so bad They'll pay $50.

362
00:21:22,046 --> 00:21:24,240
Scott: the thing is there aren't enough of those people.

363
00:21:24,601 --> 00:21:29,760
Rym: I mean I wanted everything they had to offer but even I wasn't willing to pay that I didn't want everything they had to.

364
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:32,078
Rym: Well, I wanted a lot of what they had to offer.

365
00:21:32,118 --> 00:21:37,440
Rym: yes I would have paid quite a bit more than you'd expect, but still not even close to what they were asking.

366
00:21:37,661 --> 00:21:43,840
Scott: I would have paid you know 15 20 bucks for some of those things they had again Not even close to what they were asking exactly.

367
00:21:44,643 --> 00:21:49,320
Rym: But I honestly I it's interesting because the anime industry can really go in two directions.

368
00:21:49,461 --> 00:21:58,396
Rym: And I feel like after there were this boom for a while and now that it's kind of fading I feel like this isn't going to affect the long-term industry.

369
00:21:58,757 --> 00:22:10,474
Rym: in fact in General the drying up of anime stuff in stores isn't going to affect the long-term industry because the fan base is primarily Online now and technologically savvy at least to a minor degree.

370
00:22:11,036 --> 00:22:29,340
Rym: so unless anime communities anime culture anime fandom and the industry Actually reach out and get the mainstream audience that they're recording and then they kind of abandoned Then retail presence won't mean anything And they've really got to focus on online business models and read like I don't merchandise at cons fan stuff.

371
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,540
Rym: They have to really go for the secondary streams of revenue.

372
00:22:31,881 --> 00:22:40,348
Scott: I think the one thing that's gonna be key for the future of anime in the United States right is What's gonna be on TV cuz you look right?

373
00:22:40,368 --> 00:22:48,246
Scott: We've got this generation of like you know teenagers right now who are into it right, but are Will the next generation be into it?

374
00:22:48,286 --> 00:22:53,427
Scott: and even though they're watching lots of videos on the Internet's you know so some of them Are gonna be into it.

375
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:54,938
Scott: you know really you?

376
00:22:55,842 --> 00:23:03,026
Scott: Ask people how they got into anime even us is because we saw something on TV even if it was an off-hour even if you know.

377
00:23:03,367 --> 00:23:10,352
Scott: so I think the future of anime at least for the next decade or so is What is on TV?

378
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:11,439
Scott: What gets on TV?

379
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,985
Scott: And there's no anime on TV.

380
00:23:14,325 --> 00:23:20,320
Scott: you can guarantee you that two or three generations behind this anime is gonna get less popular.

381
00:23:20,562 --> 00:23:22,560
Rym: Well like I said there are two futures either.

382
00:23:22,721 --> 00:23:25,580
Rym: They have to court the mainstream audience like they did to us.

383
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:30,016
Rym: I mean I saw a vampire hunter D And all I could think was this is the greatest thing I've ever seen.

384
00:23:30,036 --> 00:23:34,723
Rym: I Have to see more things like this for the but it wasn't the greatest thing you've ever seen Back then.

385
00:23:34,764 --> 00:23:35,567
Rym: it was like that.

386
00:23:35,607 --> 00:23:40,326
Rym: I saw a vampire hunter D and for a fourth grader That was the best thing in the world.

387
00:23:40,547 --> 00:23:41,611
Scott: yes for a fourth grade.

388
00:23:42,073 --> 00:23:44,000
Rym: That's that's about what I think the target audience is.

389
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:51,691
Scott: I still like vampire Vampire hunter D is good, but it's not the best thing ever.

390
00:23:51,872 --> 00:23:57,714
Rym: no, but it it's up there partly due to nostalgia But you know I saw it on TV partly due to hand the mouth.

391
00:23:57,975 --> 00:23:59,140
Rym: the hand was so snarky.

392
00:23:59,241 --> 00:24:23,824
Rym: Yeah but if They don't court the mainstream audience like they used to and if they don't do the obvious awesome thing like putting Golf manga in the golf magazine or just showing cowboy bebop and HBO and making a big deal about it Then they're pretty much gonna have to go with the secondary root of secondary income Internet fans their children kind of the completely side Demographic

393
00:24:23,924 --> 00:24:26,274
Scott: the putting the golf manga in the golf magazine.

394
00:24:26,314 --> 00:24:32,434
Scott: that when the economy was good We were asking for that because that's the big risk big reward move right instead.

395
00:24:32,494 --> 00:24:36,026
Scott: They were sort of taking the just Spread out.

396
00:24:36,247 --> 00:24:44,880
Scott: real thin low risk low reward Move, but the thing is it was low risk, but it wasn't like a smart move.

397
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,382
Scott: You know it was.

398
00:24:45,462 --> 00:24:50,080
Scott: it was low risk if things stayed the same, so it was like it was a deceptively low.

399
00:24:50,341 --> 00:24:53,435
Rym: I think the real problem was that the industry especially the anime side.

400
00:24:53,636 --> 00:24:55,663
Rym: the manga side had it But in for different reasons.

401
00:24:56,405 --> 00:25:01,620
Rym: they went into this like licensing frenzy, and they licensed everything because anime was selling like crazy.

402
00:25:01,922 --> 00:25:09,586
Rym: Yeah, I mean I was buying a ton of anime for a long time And then I realized that I already had seen almost everything I liked and there wasn't much new coming out that I liked.

403
00:25:09,666 --> 00:25:12,654
Rym: and then fan subs and everything went to crap.

404
00:25:12,694 --> 00:25:22,186
Scott: and now I But yeah the Yeah, I forgot.

405
00:25:22,206 --> 00:25:23,349
Scott: I was gonna say it doesn't matter.

406
00:25:23,369 --> 00:25:27,426
Scott: we've talked about how anime is you know not doing so great for a very long time.

407
00:25:27,467 --> 00:25:33,580
Scott: it's an Ongoing discussion that doesn't change very much at all, but don't worry because there is actually some upbeat news.

408
00:25:33,661 --> 00:25:36,200
Rym: It turns out that Viz is laying people off and restructuring.

409
00:25:36,442 --> 00:25:38,339
Rym: Maybe that's not it.

410
00:25:40,381 --> 00:25:45,680
Scott: Yeah, basically I think what's gonna happen right now at least in the short term is during the bad economy.

411
00:25:46,181 --> 00:25:56,448
Scott: There's very small anime companies are basically either going to die or do a CPM thing where they sit and do nothing and The bigger companies are gonna hold back.

412
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:57,892
Scott: You know Tokyo pops doing it.

413
00:25:57,952 --> 00:26:00,580
Scott: You know it making its releases less frequent.

414
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,293
Scott: So you're getting you know one volume every four or six months.

415
00:26:03,354 --> 00:26:04,620
Scott: is that every one or two months?

416
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:13,697
Scott: You know stuff like that They're gonna hold back and only do the bigger titles cut the lower titles or delay them Or you know get rid of them or whatever.

417
00:26:13,718 --> 00:26:20,529
Scott: well I think anyone who's smart and they're just gonna be real conservative and then when the economy gets better They'll be able to try to make another move.

418
00:26:20,649 --> 00:26:29,217
Scott: or maybe they'll get lucky and some other Naruto crazy big property will come out and they'll get it on TV, and it'll be Pokemon all over again.

419
00:26:29,578 --> 00:26:29,738
Rym: see.

420
00:26:29,778 --> 00:26:31,282
Rym: but actually What?

421
00:26:31,363 --> 00:26:52,835
Rym: the way to the smart way right now to act is to look at the anime conventions and the fact that their attendance is Only growing and they're getting bigger and bigger, but at the same time from what I've heard Total this is just like based on rumors and hearsay, but I have heard that dealers and anime cons are having a real rough Mmm, and part of that is due to saturation and all sorts of reasons.

422
00:26:52,875 --> 00:27:02,800
Rym: I could I could think of a few offhand But I think the main reason the fact that most of the dealers are selling the same crap You got like ten booths have the exact same Gundam model and the exact same pins.

423
00:27:03,201 --> 00:27:08,000
Scott: Yeah, I mean the first time I went to that Otakon dealers room even that Ohio con dealers room, right?

424
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,465
Scott: It's like holy shit.

425
00:27:09,485 --> 00:27:10,769
Scott: look at this stuff right.

426
00:27:10,809 --> 00:27:15,083
Scott: and even that Ohio con dealers room was small real small But you know what.

427
00:27:15,123 --> 00:27:20,680
Scott: they had stuff in there that looking back even now that was stuff that you don't see in dealers rooms nowadays.

428
00:27:21,062 --> 00:27:24,743
Rym: They had you know some but it's not just the dealers doing this It's everyone.

429
00:27:24,844 --> 00:27:27,338
Rym: every anime con is stagnated into the same thing.

430
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,440
Rym: They'll have the cosplay they'll have the same set of lame fan panels.

431
00:27:30,662 --> 00:27:32,880
Rym: They all have the same set of pathetic industry panels.

432
00:27:33,341 --> 00:27:48,800
Rym: Then they'll have like like everything they do is so rote and so set in stone that the fan base is kind of changing in this really generic way when what the industry should be doing is Actually doing something different at the cons.

433
00:27:49,104 --> 00:27:58,060
Rym: I'm not gonna get into the details But if they did something different at the conventions They could spark interest in the terror in the properties that aren't well known.

434
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,628
Rym: But yet if known would sell like crazy.

435
00:28:00,689 --> 00:28:04,120
Rym: in other words existing anime fan in other words intelligent marketing.

436
00:28:04,922 --> 00:28:05,945
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

437
00:28:06,005 --> 00:28:09,616
Scott: Yeah that you know, but hey people they don't have that like.

438
00:28:09,676 --> 00:28:11,120
Rym: imagine if this they've never had.

439
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:16,620
Rym: Remember when we did that gecky goth panel at Otakon the the infamous rated Gerald gecky goth panel.

440
00:28:16,869 --> 00:28:28,379
Rym: Yeah Imagine if the next day in the dealers room There had been one dealer that had just piles of sanctuary and eagle and the tree manga And just all of that stuff.

441
00:28:28,561 --> 00:28:32,140
Scott: Well, there would have been a hundred people that were in that room who would have bought it.

442
00:28:32,341 --> 00:28:33,819
Rym: There are more than a hundred people in that room.

443
00:28:34,041 --> 00:28:37,839
Rym: I think I actually have the count on my little spreadsheet of every panel we've ever done.

444
00:28:38,442 --> 00:28:40,450
Scott: Well, it was you know, the room was full.

445
00:28:40,711 --> 00:28:43,080
Scott: everyone in that room probably would have bought at least something.

446
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,340
Scott: You know at least like one volume is actually now.

447
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:59,788
Rym: Imagine if instead of just Rym and Scott doing a panel about gecky guy that talks Somewhat about a few of these titles the industry put together a professional pack style thing about that manga Mm-hmm on the main event stage.

448
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:01,837
Rym: Mm-hmm, but it's not gonna happen.

449
00:29:02,138 --> 00:29:02,640
Scott: No, I'm not gonna.

450
00:29:04,244 --> 00:29:06,460
Rym: But there is one more thing that I do have to talk about.

451
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,125
Rym: This is very important anime news.

452
00:29:08,166 --> 00:29:10,694
Rym: Like this is the most important anime news.

453
00:29:10,734 --> 00:29:12,520
Rym: You're gonna hear in it for a while.

454
00:29:12,701 --> 00:29:18,020
Rym: Alright, they have added Krauser sama to Street Fighter online.

455
00:29:18,702 --> 00:29:21,290
Scott: Is Street Fighter online an actual thing made by Capcom?

456
00:29:21,391 --> 00:29:24,260
Scott: or is it like something that they just call it's like a flash game?

457
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,280
Rym: Japanese software developer daletto is added the Johan's Krauser the second character.

458
00:29:29,602 --> 00:29:32,580
Scott: I think that's one of those right metal city rock parody manga.

459
00:29:32,941 --> 00:29:38,680
Rym: Apparently this anime news network article said glam rock and then they were forced to change it by someone who was angry.

460
00:29:39,003 --> 00:29:40,579
Scott: Yeah, I guess it's one of those.

461
00:29:41,021 --> 00:29:47,585
Scott: I think it's one of those online flash games where the guy just puts every freaking character in the universe You know so you could fight.

462
00:29:48,048 --> 00:29:49,153
Scott: it's one of those things I think.

463
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:53,263
Scott: well, he looks 3d ish I don't know that though, but you know That's all I have.

464
00:29:53,644 --> 00:29:53,844
Scott: Okay.

465
00:29:54,065 --> 00:29:56,230
Scott: Yeah Krauser is probably like the most powerful character.

466
00:29:57,112 --> 00:29:59,679
Scott: I can't really imagine anyone who could beat him except Voltron.

467
00:30:06,923 --> 00:30:16,020
Rym: But anyway things of the day, you know, it's not an anime thing But I feel like it gets stagnant if you only use things of the day related to the topic at hand.

468
00:30:16,121 --> 00:30:18,824
Scott: Well, I don't know if it gets stagnant But I think it's actually.

469
00:30:18,844 --> 00:30:23,960
Scott: there haven't been a lot of anime comic things of the day lately to use.

470
00:30:24,081 --> 00:30:27,660
Scott: So it's sort of like you got to dig into the other bins or else you're gonna come up dry.

471
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:31,699
Rym: Well primarily I I just had to use this because it's too good.

472
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:35,210
Scott: Yeah, I would have used it on Tuesday if you didn't steal it.

473
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:39,559
Rym: This is pretty much the best text adventure I've played in a while.

474
00:30:40,681 --> 00:30:41,203
Scott: I've played.

475
00:30:41,223 --> 00:30:41,525
Scott: well.

476
00:30:42,087 --> 00:30:50,960
Scott: if you want to talk about, you know actual like quality I mean, I've played some good text adventures lately, but this is pretty humorous.

477
00:30:51,442 --> 00:30:52,626
Rym: well, it's up there because it.

478
00:30:53,047 --> 00:30:59,940
Rym: it illustrates a lot of interesting points about game design and Goals and goal-making and all that sort of stuff.

479
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,073
Rym: but the name of the game will tell you everything you need to know need to know about it.

480
00:31:04,134 --> 00:31:10,365
Rym: the game is entitled don't shit your pants and You just take it from there.

481
00:31:10,746 --> 00:31:11,890
Rym: It's I.

482
00:31:14,981 --> 00:31:23,579
Scott: Only thing you have to do to win is not shit your pants Yep, but in fact, um, you know losing is also a part of winning.

483
00:31:27,263 --> 00:31:28,466
Scott: All right, so check this out.

484
00:31:28,506 --> 00:31:33,480
Scott: this isn't anime comic related but it's somewhat Japan related.

485
00:31:33,601 --> 00:31:36,443
Scott: It's because it's a lady in Tokyo.

486
00:31:36,543 --> 00:31:38,229
Scott: she's a Japanese lady.

487
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:49,642
Scott: Yeah, and she knows how to play the ukulele And She made a ukulele And it's a cake Ukulele.

488
00:31:49,702 --> 00:31:51,307
Scott: she made it like cake and she's like.

489
00:31:51,909 --> 00:31:52,812
Scott: see the frosting.

490
00:31:52,872 --> 00:31:53,875
Scott: it is imitation.

491
00:31:54,096 --> 00:31:58,655
Scott: see this, you know Like ball of you know, this flower.

492
00:31:58,675 --> 00:31:59,800
Scott: it is clay.

493
00:32:00,523 --> 00:32:03,395
Scott: Now I'll play a song on the cake ukulele and then that's it.

494
00:32:03,415 --> 00:32:04,921
Scott: I Like.

495
00:32:05,061 --> 00:32:05,984
Scott: I like ukuleles.

496
00:32:06,646 --> 00:32:07,329
Scott: I like cake.

497
00:32:07,429 --> 00:32:08,412
Rym: Why don't you learn how to play one?

498
00:32:09,034 --> 00:32:09,716
Scott: It's not easy.

499
00:32:09,997 --> 00:32:10,820
Rym: It's not that hard.

500
00:32:11,521 --> 00:32:14,960
Rym: I've known a lot of people who learned how to play the ukulele in a hurry.

501
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,053
Scott: Yeah, but if I'm gonna do that, I might as well go play the guitar cuz.

502
00:32:19,134 --> 00:32:21,324
Scott: actually the thing is, you know Remember I will.

503
00:32:21,384 --> 00:32:23,919
Rym: if you're gonna do that you might as well play the harmonica.

504
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:28,797
Scott: Well, see the thing I realized seeing this is all the the eternal problem, right?

505
00:32:28,877 --> 00:32:34,518
Scott: It's like, okay I said this is sort of a tangent for Wednesday, but whatever right?

506
00:32:34,699 --> 00:32:43,732
Scott: Yeah I said, alright if I can prove to myself that I will actually practice this harmonica, which is $10 Right who gives a shit if I don't actually practice.

507
00:32:44,094 --> 00:32:45,020
Scott: It's not a big loss.

508
00:32:45,602 --> 00:32:51,380
Scott: Then that means I have the you know, the will to practice something that is more expensive.

509
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:59,127
Scott: Right now the problem with the harmonica, right is that of course it did not practice So much at all.

510
00:32:59,589 --> 00:32:59,830
Scott: Yeah.

511
00:33:00,091 --> 00:33:02,340
Scott: No, so that sort of sealed the deal.

512
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,992
Scott: It's like well, apparently I am NOT a practicer and I will not learn any instrument.

513
00:33:06,012 --> 00:33:10,969
Scott: So do not buy any more instruments They're because you will not practice them.

514
00:33:11,592 --> 00:33:13,017
Scott: The thing is right.

515
00:33:13,218 --> 00:33:16,149
Rym: Is that You got the DS 10 Korg thing.

516
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:21,072
Scott: Well, the DS 10 Korg thing is is pretty good Yeah, but that has nothing to do with it that I get.

517
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:22,600
Scott: haven't learned any piano from it.

518
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,964
Scott: All I've learned is synthesizer.

519
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:32,388
Scott: its synthesizer is not I guess it's an instrument technically speaking, but you know No, but the thing is who they to play.

520
00:33:32,428 --> 00:33:44,940
Scott: harmonica involves like learning all these skills of like, you know mouth dexterity Right, and while I played the clarinet and I have skills of woodwind It's not really the same mouth skill at all.

521
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:48,719
Scott: You don't have to like you only when you're playing a woodwind you just a YouTube video.

522
00:33:49,224 --> 00:33:56,720
Scott: Anyone can learn to play the harmonica I know but you know in it was more of that sort of learning was necessary.

523
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:03,500
Rym: Whereas if I got say a guitar, I would argue that the guitar takes a lot more dexterity.

524
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:11,788
Rym: and But it's manual dexterity, which is much easier than mouth Dirty, I would argue the opposite.

525
00:34:11,808 --> 00:34:13,013
Scott: I don't know.

526
00:34:13,132 --> 00:34:14,036
Scott: It's just it's a.

527
00:34:14,277 --> 00:34:18,360
Rym: it's a poor Justification - so are you gonna buy a guitar?

528
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:21,389
Scott: Probably not but I recently learned that you could get one.

529
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:22,795
Scott: That's like only like a hundred bucks.

530
00:34:22,855 --> 00:34:25,705
Scott: Yeah, so They were like 400.

531
00:34:25,705 --> 00:34:28,592
Rym: but you can just buy a guitar on Amazon.

532
00:34:28,853 --> 00:34:30,498
Rym: you can buy a used one on eBay.

533
00:34:30,538 --> 00:34:32,606
Rym: if you're learning It doesn't matter at guitars a guitar.

534
00:34:32,646 --> 00:34:35,034
Rym: My brother had like an $80 electric guitar.

535
00:34:35,054 --> 00:34:36,300
Rym: And you know what it worked just fine.

536
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,927
Scott: Is this like $100 USB?

537
00:34:38,087 --> 00:34:38,790
Scott: one on thinking?

538
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:40,879
Scott: Yeah, it's like oh wow USB, huh?

539
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,523
Scott: So it's like.

540
00:34:42,563 --> 00:34:47,460
Scott: I was thinking there are $400, which is why I was like getting the harmonica first, you know.

541
00:34:47,641 --> 00:34:50,820
Scott: And I mean I did play the guitar when I was in fifth grade, you know.

542
00:34:51,121 --> 00:35:01,217
Scott: And the only reason I stopped which was because I started doing band in sixth grade and I was like if I if I could Have changed one thing I would have not joined the band and would have kept playing guitar instead.

543
00:35:01,257 --> 00:35:05,331
Scott: because imagine If I had kept playing the guitar since fifth grade, let's see.

544
00:35:05,432 --> 00:35:12,897
Scott: I was 10 and now I'm 26 so I would have have 16 years of guitar experience.

545
00:35:12,978 --> 00:35:13,700
Scott: I'll be rocking.

546
00:35:14,685 --> 00:35:15,639
Scott: My whole life would be different.

547
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:21,988
Scott: Maybe instead I played the clarinet for Four years and then stop because it sucked.

548
00:35:22,249 --> 00:35:23,392
Rym: see it doesn't suck.

549
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:25,820
Rym: You should have switched up to the soprano sax.

550
00:35:27,022 --> 00:35:27,787
Rym: No, why not?

551
00:35:27,807 --> 00:35:29,680
Rym: That's actually an awesome jazz instrument.

552
00:35:30,861 --> 00:35:32,050
Rym: Because cuz why?

553
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,340
Rym: what's wrong with the saxophone?

554
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,215
Scott: Basically, it was nothing to do with the instrument.

555
00:35:36,255 --> 00:35:37,060
Scott: That was the problem.

556
00:35:37,562 --> 00:35:41,220
Scott: It was the fact that you know, I was happy in the sit-down band.

557
00:35:41,482 --> 00:35:44,847
Scott: But then when you get to high school It's pretty much marching band or nothing.

558
00:35:44,888 --> 00:35:46,475
Scott: and I was like fuck this marching band.

559
00:35:46,595 --> 00:35:51,180
Rym: and then that doesn't have to be At least in most high schools I saw you could just join like the wind ensemble.

560
00:35:51,702 --> 00:35:56,999
Scott: They did not have a wind ensemble and pretty much all they did have other bands, you know that to do.

561
00:35:57,882 --> 00:36:06,495
Scott: But all of them were basically like marching band offshoots Like the jazz band was like a bunch of people from the marching band.

562
00:36:06,515 --> 00:36:08,000
Scott: You couldn't just join the jazz band.

563
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,294
Scott: It was like everyone's in the marching band.

564
00:36:10,354 --> 00:36:15,864
Scott: and then you know They sort of split up into the other bands and in the winter when it's cold They are the.

565
00:36:16,206 --> 00:36:18,136
Scott: you know, the marching band is the symphonic band.

566
00:36:18,156 --> 00:36:18,859
Scott: They just sit down.

567
00:36:19,683 --> 00:36:21,732
Scott: So it's like you couldn't do one without the other.

568
00:36:21,873 --> 00:36:23,239
Scott: the way it was set up there, huh?

569
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:31,413
Scott: And I was not, you know, very pleased with the the marching band situation and thus I don't understand why marching band is the business.

570
00:36:31,474 --> 00:36:34,826
Rym: No, it is not is Most definitely the business.

571
00:36:34,846 --> 00:36:35,548
Rym: I was.

572
00:36:35,669 --> 00:36:36,090
Scott: it was to.

573
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:39,580
Scott: you know, the problem with marching band is that you know regular is too awesome.

574
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,548
Scott: You know, it's too terrible.

575
00:36:41,568 --> 00:36:42,411
Scott: I mean it was.

576
00:36:42,632 --> 00:36:45,263
Scott: it really was just too militaristic, you know It's like in.

577
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:49,040
Scott: that's what makes it go makes it terrible because you know think about it.

578
00:36:49,281 --> 00:36:56,460
Scott: I even if I did it right they'd be like, you know, like I had friends in the marching band and they'd be like You know, uh, you know, I messed up and they made me do push-ups.

579
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:02,570
Scott: It's like yeah, if anyone told me to do push-ups, I'd give him the finger I'd be like fuck you Scott and then that'll be the end of that.

580
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:02,911
Scott: when

581
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:08,760
Rym: punk freshman showed up late to my trumpet rehearsals At band camp they were running laps around the football field while I watch

582
00:37:08,901 --> 00:37:14,280
Scott: I would have said no and if you would have made me I would have kicked you in the nuts Which is why I would not have fit into marching band.

583
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:18,240
Scott: I was fine with the sit-down band because the sit-down band you walk in you sit down.

584
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,950
Scott: Everyone's hanging out having a good time.

585
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:29,300
Rym: the conductor, you know Scott I want to point out a good sit-down band is As the same amount of yelling and and the equivalent mental exercise of pushing.

586
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:32,400
Scott: Well, the sit-down band that I was in did not have this problem.

587
00:37:32,581 --> 00:37:40,540
Scott: It was pretty much just like everyone having a good time playing music, you know I mean the conductor might point at you and if you're not doing something, right and you know.

588
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:51,436
Rym: But they wouldn't be yelling at you or I got yelled at or making you do anything, you know He's got you should watch no Damaic on table because that is pretty much a 100% doctor yelling at people.

589
00:37:51,577 --> 00:37:56,418
Rym: a 100% Accurate view of what it's like to be in a band is the conductor yelling at people.

590
00:37:56,498 --> 00:37:59,249
Scott: Yes Yeah, see that's that's why I wasn't gonna go for that.

591
00:37:59,931 --> 00:38:00,393
Scott: I'm too.

592
00:38:00,794 --> 00:38:09,267
Scott: I'm not taking orders Fragile of a flower for the marching band apparently, but no You're not talking about marching band.

593
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:09,969
Scott: You can't.

594
00:38:10,049 --> 00:38:11,775
Scott: you can't because you see I will spike you.

595
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:18,432
Rym: almost 30 years ago Osamu Tezuka's Astro Boy got its second anime.

596
00:38:18,753 --> 00:38:20,940
Scott: Well, yeah, cuz it was you know, it was so good.

597
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:27,643
Scott: It was you know, the first dish not the absolute first of course, but the first dish and bestest Anime in the 60s.

598
00:38:27,663 --> 00:38:37,691
Scott: It is effectively the first anime effectively modern animation from Japan Yep, and you know, it was so popular and awesome and amazing and so was the manga.

599
00:38:37,791 --> 00:38:52,287
Scott: but you know after the 70s and you know It came around to the 80s There was a whole new generation of children in Japan and the 60s Astro Boy was a little dated, you know They weren't watching black and white anymore.

600
00:38:52,387 --> 00:38:58,574
Scott: Everyone had to color TVs now, so they needed a color Astro Boy And that's what they did now.

601
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:10,146
Rym: I do want to point out that it says on the anime news network that the 1980s Astro Boy is rated all ages and quotes nothing Objectionable, well,

602
00:39:10,934 --> 00:39:34,820
Scott: there's nothing Objectionable, but if you compare it, you know people right now if you go to the store They actually recently put out DVDs of early Sesame Street, right like 70 Sesame Street and it says on those DVDs This isn't actually appropriate for children, you know These are for old people to have nostalgia not for children to actually watch in place of modern Sesame Street.

603
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:41,960
Scott: And you know, there's some good stuff on there like learning to count and such right slowly slowly slowly getting faster, right?

604
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:59,389
Scott: But if you actually watch them like there is some stuff in there That's like oh and you remember the world was a different place in the 70s And Stuff that was appropriate then is not really appropriate now You know, I mean not all of it is timeless.

605
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:04,270
Rym: if I had one word to describe the 1980s Astro Boy It is rough.

606
00:40:04,794 --> 00:40:05,540
Scott: It is really rough.

607
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,470
Scott: I mean basically what it is is there they are.

608
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:11,640
Scott: there's not really an objectional content, you know, it's it's cartoon.

609
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,969
Scott: You know blow stuff up violence.

610
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:16,980
Scott: It's you know, there's no sex at all.

611
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:21,538
Scott: No, you know, no, you know and you know, the thing is is the morals of this.

612
00:40:21,698 --> 00:40:26,940
Scott: every, you know Every episode of course has a moral right just like the manga and in the old show and everything.

613
00:40:27,363 --> 00:40:42,155
Scott: but the morals are Very sort of serious and adult a lot more serious than the morals you'll get in like the GI Joe Episode streak where the moral of every episode was basically Astro Boy crying.

614
00:40:42,435 --> 00:40:44,380
Rym: Why did humans make us this way the end?

615
00:40:44,921 --> 00:40:53,396
Scott: Pretty much the what every episode has sort of a temporary character who will die who will die Tragically, you know or something terrible happened.

616
00:40:53,416 --> 00:40:53,737
Scott: It's like.

617
00:40:54,039 --> 00:41:02,860
Scott: and so for example There was an episode where the there was a robot who wanted to be president of some small country, right?

618
00:41:03,421 --> 00:41:06,959
Scott: And there was an evil guy who hated robots who wanted to stop him.

619
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:12,100
Scott: But actually it turned out that evil guy was the guy who made the robot president and he died.

620
00:41:13,123 --> 00:41:13,304
Rym: Who?

621
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:14,675
Rym: the robot president or the guy?

622
00:41:14,695 --> 00:41:21,180
Rym: the guy See, I think what Astro Boy 1980s first off is fantastic.

623
00:41:21,602 --> 00:41:26,400
Rym: I highly recommend if you're an anime fan watch it with a group of other anime fans.

624
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,024
Rym: Yeah, I mean it is.

625
00:41:27,105 --> 00:41:28,595
Rym: it's a children's show and you'll watch it.

626
00:41:28,655 --> 00:41:33,680
Rym: It's obvious It is a children's show and if you're watching it alone, you probably wouldn't get that much out of it.

627
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:43,020
Rym: But there's something about giving the over/under on How long it's gonna take for the character they show you to die horribly at Astro Boy's hands.

628
00:41:43,261 --> 00:41:49,180
Scott: Yeah, actually I sort of think you know, there are a lot of Astro Boys you could watch including the yet-to-be-released CG movie.

629
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:49,541
Scott: Right.

630
00:41:50,002 --> 00:42:02,239
Scott: So the thing is here, let me do the manga right, you know while you should read some of the manga I mean Dark Horse recently combined volumes one and two into a single book, you know I have that but I don't have any other volumes.

631
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:07,453
Scott: That's actually like, you know, you should read that to get the history of it.

632
00:42:07,934 --> 00:42:12,530
Scott: but reading the old Astro Boy manga It's not Tezuka's like, you know mad.

633
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:22,040
Scott: He didn't have his full skills, especially early on You know, so it's it's not Must walk as mortal men at first until they attain their god, of course.

634
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:25,512
Scott: So it's not really like the most polished amazing thing.

635
00:42:25,532 --> 00:42:27,620
Scott: You know, you're getting the seas gets the stories across.

636
00:42:28,063 --> 00:42:33,672
Scott: There's some good artworks in there But really it's not you know gonna give you the full effect.

637
00:42:33,873 --> 00:42:41,820
Scott: right you can watch the old 60s show Which is also I recommend you do that at least a little bit right, but it is horrendously dated.

638
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,267
Scott: It's like watching like, you know, mr.

639
00:42:44,307 --> 00:42:48,520
Scott: Magoo or some other incredibly old, you know, even older to that cartoons.

640
00:42:48,681 --> 00:42:57,352
Scott: You know, it's just so old and and so cheaply animated and choppy that you know It's not really gonna give you the full experience.

641
00:42:57,413 --> 00:43:00,748
Scott: It's just giving you this sort of Historical experience.

642
00:43:00,928 --> 00:43:01,812
Rym: but Astro Boy 1980 is.

643
00:43:01,852 --> 00:43:07,820
Rym: I mean We're not going to talk about the newer Astro Boys because a lot of people what I hear from most people is that?

644
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,407
Rym: The new Astro Boy TV is really good.

645
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:13,980
Rym: But the dub is like painful to the point of agony.

646
00:43:14,241 --> 00:43:18,101
Scott: Yes, and the thing is is you the new Astro Boy 2004?

647
00:43:18,101 --> 00:43:23,400
Scott: I think you can get the whole thing on DVD in the US for like 20 bucks, but it's dub only.

648
00:43:24,121 --> 00:43:26,151
Scott: So and I heard the dub is terrible.

649
00:43:26,775 --> 00:43:27,760
Scott: So what are you supposed to do?

650
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:34,964
Scott: This is great new Astro Boy from 2004, but you can't watch it because it's only dubbed and the dub is terrible There's no subs.

651
00:43:35,124 --> 00:43:37,817
Rym: So the answer is to watch the 1980s Astro Boy.

652
00:43:37,857 --> 00:43:38,420
Scott: That is correct.

653
00:43:38,962 --> 00:43:39,765
Rym: It's one thing.

654
00:43:39,985 --> 00:43:45,567
Rym: you'll look at it and it looks better than American cartoons from the late 80s Even the early 90s even the mid 90s.

655
00:43:45,587 --> 00:43:49,803
Scott: Yeah, I mean think about it Super Mario Brothers Super Show, right 90s Guess what.

656
00:43:50,465 --> 00:43:55,064
Scott: this 80s Astro Boy from 1980 looks a lot better than that Whole lot better.

657
00:43:55,104 --> 00:44:08,770
Rym: and if you don't if you don't remember the Super Mario Brothers Super Show and you think that if you have any respect for it, I commend I recommend that you go and Experience what it is to see that through the eyes of an adult.

658
00:44:09,171 --> 00:44:16,899
Scott: I mean this thing has the animation quality of like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which is like, you know middle 90s ish, right?

659
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,764
Scott: So and this is for 1980 eight zero.

660
00:44:18,784 --> 00:44:19,246
Scott: Yeah, not 80s 80.

661
00:44:19,246 --> 00:44:27,455
Scott: Yeah, so That's pretty damn good right there considering it's a you know, a TV show.

662
00:44:27,495 --> 00:44:28,640
Scott: but now it's Astro Boy.

663
00:44:28,701 --> 00:44:29,875
Scott: So they give it the full effort.

664
00:44:30,138 --> 00:44:32,086
Rym: now It is a reimagining like a reset.

665
00:44:32,126 --> 00:44:33,530
Rym: so it starts off at the very beginning.

666
00:44:33,611 --> 00:44:37,498
Rym: and the thing about the 1980s Astro Boy because I said before it's rough.

667
00:44:38,523 --> 00:44:45,820
Rym: the overview is thus a Scientist a robot scientist has a son that he neglects because he's so engrossed in his work.

668
00:44:46,321 --> 00:44:51,220
Rym: The son after having a fight with his dad dies in a car accident alone and angry.

669
00:44:52,124 --> 00:45:01,299
Rym: The dad so distraught remakes this job this killing robot he was making into a replica of his child and tries to raise it as though his son had never died.

670
00:45:01,319 --> 00:45:04,849
Rym: and Then as the robot does not act exactly like his son.

671
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:07,940
Rym: He comes to hate it and eventually cast it away from his sight.

672
00:45:08,921 --> 00:45:10,710
Rym: That is how Astro Boy begins.

673
00:45:11,092 --> 00:45:12,620
Scott: Yeah, I mean, it's sort of weird, right?

674
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:22,320
Scott: It's it's that usually you see a story and it'll be like a scientist and an accompanying robot or monster Whatever it is, right and the scientist is usually the maker, right?

675
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:27,876
Scott: But meanwhile an Astro Boy asteroids maker like add to the first few episodes.

676
00:45:28,237 --> 00:45:29,300
Scott: He's not there anymore.

677
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:32,369
Scott: It's like he made Astro Boy and cast him out and dr.

678
00:45:32,469 --> 00:45:36,180
Scott: Elephant slash Oh China Mizzou, whatever his real name is, right?

679
00:45:36,621 --> 00:45:38,280
Scott: He's the one taking care of Astro Boy.

680
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,760
Scott: He's the head of the Ministry of Science.

681
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:45,560
Scott: But if he if someone told him hey make a new make a copy of Astro, but he can't make a robot that good.

682
00:45:46,084 --> 00:45:47,580
Rym: Yeah, I mean your rain she's nothing.

683
00:45:48,441 --> 00:45:49,385
Scott: Yeah, he made your rain.

684
00:45:49,425 --> 00:45:51,956
Scott: Your rain is not as you know, he made Astro Boy's family.

685
00:45:51,996 --> 00:45:53,642
Scott: They're pretty stock They're not.

686
00:45:53,783 --> 00:45:55,348
Scott: they're not Astro Boy quality.

687
00:45:55,890 --> 00:45:57,034
Rym: Astro Boy's got some rice.

688
00:45:57,075 --> 00:45:57,918
Rym: He's got some rims.

689
00:45:58,138 --> 00:46:01,310
Scott: Yeah He's got a turbo and a supercharger.

690
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:02,876
Rym: and well, he's got a butt gun.

691
00:46:02,896 --> 00:46:06,256
Scott: Yeah, but good That's the hardest part is the butt gun.

692
00:46:07,248 --> 00:46:08,079
Scott: But don't shit your pants.

693
00:46:10,243 --> 00:46:16,640
Rym: But and taking it from there Here at the trope, you know We used to watch Horatio hornblower as a group when we were in college.

694
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:21,200
Rym: Like we all get around and we turn on Horatio hornblower and yell and scream.

695
00:46:21,501 --> 00:46:26,900
Rym: You want to watch her as your hornblower kinda after the show and take odds on who's gonna die and who's not gonna die.

696
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:28,025
Rym: And that's the bad guy.

697
00:46:28,065 --> 00:46:28,829
Rym: That's the good guy.

698
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:30,416
Rym: explosions and we get all into it.

699
00:46:30,436 --> 00:46:40,375
Rym: and Astro Boy is the same thing because every episode they introduce a sympathetic character and they are either going to die Tragically before or after learning their lesson.

700
00:46:40,395 --> 00:46:41,119
Rym: Mm-hmm.

701
00:46:42,002 --> 00:46:46,397
Rym: And then Asher was just left to stand there wondering why humans made them this way.

702
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:47,159
Rym: and that's the end.

703
00:46:47,681 --> 00:46:49,606
Scott: yep, it is some things that right.

704
00:46:49,646 --> 00:47:14,720
Scott: first of all a lot of the stories in this are pretty much the majority of the stories if Not all of them are actually retellings of stories from the manga or the older the 60s anime but they're retold in a Easier to watch way that doesn't feel dated, you know, it holds up over time Whereas the 60s one sort of doesn't hold up so much, you know.

705
00:47:15,962 --> 00:47:20,919
Scott: but the 80s one, you know, it tells these stories in a watchable comprehensible in modern fashion.

706
00:47:20,939 --> 00:47:23,915
Scott: and Here are some things that I really like.

707
00:47:23,976 --> 00:47:32,820
Scott: number one Whenever there's like a problem, you know you watch say, you know, I don't know any American cartoon in most anime.

708
00:47:33,082 --> 00:47:33,829
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

709
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:39,580
Scott: and when there's a problem They'll always like they'll be an easy solution, but everyone just stands around like an idiot.

710
00:47:40,122 --> 00:47:43,092
Rym: It's like Resident Evil 4 every time the big bad guy appears.

711
00:47:43,413 --> 00:47:44,115
Rym: You don't shoot him.

712
00:47:44,135 --> 00:47:46,442
Rym: You stand there during a cutscene Exactly.

713
00:47:46,603 --> 00:47:54,283
Scott: Astor boy like he was pinned down and immediately like punches through the wall and flies away like So many.

714
00:47:54,544 --> 00:47:56,189
Rym: the solution to every problem.

715
00:47:56,269 --> 00:47:59,840
Rym: I have learned from Astro boy is to punch it in the stomach until it dies.

716
00:48:00,234 --> 00:48:06,239
Scott: Yeah I mean and thing is Astro boy like doesn't hesitate ever like he was like, oh this danger whoo.

717
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:13,087
Scott: She flies right out the house, you know flies right to where the danger is punches it right in the face And he think you know, it's like.

718
00:48:13,107 --> 00:48:14,011
Scott: he doesn't hesitate.

719
00:48:14,051 --> 00:48:15,960
Scott: He goes straight for it and fixes it right away.

720
00:48:16,341 --> 00:48:18,088
Scott: It's like oh the aliens are bad.

721
00:48:18,309 --> 00:48:18,610
Scott: Boom.

722
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:25,592
Scott: He starts punching the UFOs and blowing the hell out of him And he starts just murdering other robots when they come to.

723
00:48:25,632 --> 00:48:25,773
Rym: like.

724
00:48:25,793 --> 00:48:27,800
Rym: the only person he doesn't murder is skunk.

725
00:48:28,041 --> 00:48:30,940
Rym: That bothers me because skunk deserves it more than everyone else in this.

726
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:35,173
Scott: Yeah, it's like there's all these people that he you know, he sort of reluctantly murders like.

727
00:48:35,213 --> 00:48:39,989
Scott: he's like, oh, you're a robot you're misbehaving You know, but you know and you're.

728
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:49,260
Scott: we need you to stop and you won't agree, but you're not evil You're sort of sympathetic But we can't let you continue and astro boy ends up murdering them or they end up dying.

729
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,860
Scott: Or even though I asked her boy didn't want him to die.

730
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:52,946
Scott: I just wanted him to stop.

731
00:48:53,388 --> 00:49:03,605
Scott: but meanwhile the skunk who is like You know an evil mobster who continues to just do bad thing after bad thing after bad thing Astor boy doesn't kill him.

732
00:49:03,645 --> 00:49:05,453
Scott: He just like lets him go all the time.

733
00:49:05,673 --> 00:49:07,320
Rym: Well, no, they always arrest him.

734
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:08,344
Rym: I figured that out later.

735
00:49:08,384 --> 00:49:09,829
Rym: They did every time they kept skunk.

736
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:13,378
Rym: They always put him in jail, but then in the next episode He's out again.

737
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:20,120
Scott: Yeah, and Atlas is like the best villain ever because it's like he's the bad guy, but he's not totally the bad guy.

738
00:49:20,682 --> 00:49:30,020
Scott: It's like he's not evil like skunk, but he's you know, he's sort of like Magneto almost, you know where he's bad, but he just so different and not really straight-up evil.

739
00:49:30,664 --> 00:49:32,840
Scott: But like that's the way magneto supposed to be.

740
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:37,147
Scott: I mean people have written magneto as Straight up bad and those people don't know how to write.

741
00:49:37,328 --> 00:49:41,020
Rym: what is the equivalent of watching something involving Star Wars and thinking why don't they?

742
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:44,420
Rym: Just lightsaber the fuck out of whatever it is that's causing them trouble.

743
00:49:44,733 --> 00:49:47,167
Scott: Yeah You never have to answer that question with astro boy cuz.

744
00:49:47,669 --> 00:49:50,899
Scott: if there's a problem can be solved by punching and shooting.

745
00:49:51,501 --> 00:50:00,140
Rym: Asteroid punches and shoots immediately with like if there's a big bad monster like a big machine appears like there's one episode where a giant Robot comes to kick everybody's ass.

746
00:50:00,682 --> 00:50:06,118
Rym: He just immediately punches its arm off punches inside of it and then punches all its guts until it dies.

747
00:50:06,138 --> 00:50:09,227
Scott: Yep It's good stuff real good stuff.

748
00:50:09,488 --> 00:50:13,660
Scott: I mean the thing is when you remember that this is like a cartoon for kids, right?

749
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:18,020
Scott: It's like okay, you know punching and exploding robots is okay for kids, right?

750
00:50:18,421 --> 00:50:26,446
Scott: But like there'll be a robot who's effectively a human character and he punches a hole right through its chest and it like It dies.

751
00:50:26,527 --> 00:50:35,387
Scott: and then you see astro by crying or you know Looking like he's gonna cry and the episodes over and it's like whoa This is a kids cartoon.

752
00:50:35,648 --> 00:50:37,957
Rym: Don't forget humans get it just as often.

753
00:50:37,977 --> 00:50:42,119
Scott:  yes The thing is humans technically don't die in the show.

754
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:48,800
Scott: But really like you'll see a manned like fighter jet explode and you won't see any parachutes.

755
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:51,189
Rym: Yeah, there's none of that GI Joe BS in this.

756
00:50:51,409 --> 00:50:56,086
Scott: Yeah, so there are people who die But you just have to you don't notice.

757
00:50:56,146 --> 00:51:01,184
Scott: unless you look closely and you realize oh shit like a hundred people just got Brutally murdered.

758
00:51:01,245 --> 00:51:05,219
Rym: Well except for the episode where astro boys the captain of that ship.

759
00:51:05,963 --> 00:51:09,276
Rym: Oh, that was a great ever see a lot of people die on screen in that one.

760
00:51:09,638 --> 00:51:12,310
Rym: Yeah That still is my favorite episode.

761
00:51:12,330 --> 00:51:17,410
Rym: basically that was a really good one because you know The whole thing is Astro boy takes the immediate direct action.

762
00:51:17,851 --> 00:51:19,116
Rym: He's always right.

763
00:51:19,357 --> 00:51:20,240
Rym: He never lies.

764
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,129
Rym: He's pretty much perfect in every way.

765
00:51:22,149 --> 00:51:24,520
Rym: That's kind of the moral of the show, you know, he's made to be good.

766
00:51:24,963 --> 00:51:26,979
Rym: So he's good and he can't be but good.

767
00:51:27,882 --> 00:51:41,620
Rym: but in that episode he's appointed captain of this expedition to Mars and Right away someone in the crew is like a damn robot Can't be the boss of me and astro boys responses basically shut your human face and do what I say.

768
00:51:42,024 --> 00:51:43,420
Scott: Oh, yeah, that was that was great.

769
00:51:44,162 --> 00:51:47,731
Rym: But astro I've checked the thingy a thousand times and it's flying.

770
00:51:48,012 --> 00:51:48,553
Rym: check it again.

771
00:51:48,674 --> 00:51:49,716
Rym: But sir, there's no need.

772
00:51:49,877 --> 00:51:52,036
Rym: I said check it again That's right.

773
00:51:53,061 --> 00:51:54,205
Scott: What gives them the business?

774
00:51:54,365 --> 00:51:57,697
Rym: but then the guy tries to murder astro boy and that doesn't work.

775
00:51:58,158 --> 00:52:00,428
Rym: No Right just comes back face.

776
00:52:00,709 --> 00:52:01,634
Rym: That's what the best scene.

777
00:52:01,654 --> 00:52:05,958
Rym: when astro boy makes it back to the ship He's like, I need to see you in my office right now.

778
00:52:07,481 --> 00:52:12,560
Scott: It's like you're getting told what to do by what appears to be a little kid and is effectively a little kid.

779
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,809
Scott: I mean, he's a relatively new robot.

780
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:15,633
Scott: I mean, what's he?

781
00:52:15,834 --> 00:52:18,663
Scott: not even a few years old Right.

782
00:52:19,186 --> 00:52:21,360
Scott: He's just wicked powerful and he's a robot.

783
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:29,995
Scott: So he's wicked smart and he's in a body that looks like a kid robot, you know Really astro boys parents are younger than astro boy.

784
00:52:30,316 --> 00:52:35,420
Rym: Think about that Plus just the fact that his parents kind of nominally control him.

785
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:47,723
Scott: But anytime something serious goes on he just punches a hole in the wall and leaves well, cuz really, you know, his parents are just there to sort of you know, if you think about it on sort of a meta level.

786
00:52:47,783 --> 00:53:01,800
Scott: right what the show doesn't say is that the reason astro boy has a family is that he can Sort of live a simulated human life and be more empathetic with the human race and such and such and thus He won't be no turn out to be one of those robots.

787
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:06,069
Scott: He goes crazy and kills everyone and that's why you know He's all he likes humans.

788
00:53:06,109 --> 00:53:17,162
Scott: if you didn't have a family and he was just living with you know The doctor and being a robot of science He'd be a lot more like some of the other robots you see in the show like, you know, who are just assistants And

789
00:53:17,323 --> 00:53:19,316
Rym: daddy walrus would have straightened him out.

790
00:53:19,517 --> 00:53:23,860
Scott: Yeah Yeah, that's you know, that's why he sent to school and such like that.

791
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:24,442
Scott: You know where you don't?

792
00:53:24,482 --> 00:53:26,089
Scott: you don't see other robots doing these things.

793
00:53:26,109 --> 00:53:28,720
Scott: you only see astro boy doing these things so much.

794
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:40,400
Rym: but I guess the real joy of this show is to watch it with a group of people who are in anime in some fashion and To just revel in what is good about the show and what is bad or doesn't make sense.

795
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,548
Scott: Yeah, I mean we're watching the dub on Netflix.

796
00:53:42,568 --> 00:53:43,752
Scott: I haven't watched a sub.

797
00:53:43,853 --> 00:53:45,900
Rym: if there is one the dub works just fine.

798
00:53:46,141 --> 00:53:46,683
Scott: Yeah, the dub.

799
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:49,653
Scott: I mean there are some parts in the dub that are sort of ungood.

800
00:53:49,955 --> 00:53:51,299
Rym: What is wrong with you?

801
00:53:51,500 --> 00:54:00,487
Scott: Astro a lot of it is when someone's obviously trying to match lip flaps or there's a temporary character Who has a bad actor.

802
00:54:01,069 --> 00:54:03,077
Scott: but astro boys voice is really good.

803
00:54:03,097 --> 00:54:07,689
Scott: you get you know After a couple episodes whoever's voice acting him is doing a great job.

804
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:18,418
Scott: You know, the professor is due as a great voice, you know Rain has sort of a bad voice needs to work on that kind of works because she's kind of messed up.

805
00:54:18,679 --> 00:54:26,180
Scott: Yeah Yeah, I mean, you know The voices are alright, you know, it's it's a. it's a good as dub as you're gonna get for that kind of thing.

806
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:33,684
Scott: You know, it's not quite as good as a cow bebop dub, but it's better than much better than the average dub and It's just fine.

807
00:54:34,206 --> 00:54:40,498
Scott: If that's you know, if you're gonna Netflix stream it go for it, you know No reason to buy DVDs just to get the subtitles if you don't have to.

808
00:54:40,719 --> 00:54:42,264
Rym: Yep I mean I'd highly recommend it.

809
00:54:42,284 --> 00:54:46,400
Rym: if you're an anime fan at least watch like the first ten episodes of this to see what we're talking about.

810
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:52,680
Scott: And the key to getting the full enjoyment is just really think about exactly what you're watching.

811
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:57,880
Scott: You know notice like when something like heart and then think this is a kids show, right?

812
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:11,819
Scott: so when they go in to arrest the guy who with it in the death balloon episode and he points a gun at his head and Then they have to start that asteroids like run and grab the gun or whatever to keep him from killing himself Remember that was a show for like little kids.

813
00:55:12,502 --> 00:55:14,147
Rym: Even better is the man.

814
00:55:14,167 --> 00:55:16,494
Scott: the entertainment value goes way up when you think about that.

815
00:55:16,675 --> 00:55:29,660
Rym: if you take everything at face value I mean a lot of times the show the show is weird and that much of the time It makes a lot more sense than other Anime or other TV shows in general at face value because there's a problem.

816
00:55:30,102 --> 00:55:32,859
Rym: Astro boy like say he finds out where the bad guy is.

817
00:55:33,221 --> 00:55:40,580
Rym: The next scene is him flying into their hideout and punching all of them Like immediately just cuts right to him busting into the ceiling.

818
00:55:41,143 --> 00:55:50,712
Rym: He does takes the immediate direct action all the time But at the same time they'll just take all the kids in the elementary school class and send him on a field trip Unguarded into space.

819
00:55:51,297 --> 00:55:57,580
Rym: Yep And then they lose contact with it and they don't have any like plan or means to save them whatsoever.

820
00:55:57,922 --> 00:56:01,100
Scott: Well, Astro boys up there, but other than that they got nothing.

821
00:56:02,402 --> 00:56:05,239
Rym: Those kids almost died in the cold vacuum of space like four times.

822
00:56:05,259 --> 00:56:06,824
Rym: Yeah Yeah, there's a lot of.

823
00:56:06,924 --> 00:56:07,586
Scott: there's a lot of.

824
00:56:07,807 --> 00:56:16,554
Scott: you know, sort of sometimes the premises of the episodes are a little screwed up But what happens within the context of the screwed up premise is never screwed up.

825
00:56:17,437 --> 00:56:21,431
Rym: if that makes any sense I guess I enjoy the show and I expect you would too.

826
00:56:21,451 --> 00:56:23,760
Rym: and even if you don't it's a part of anime history.

827
00:56:24,081 --> 00:56:26,330
Rym: You should at least have seen some of all the Astro.

828
00:56:26,370 --> 00:56:35,695
Scott: if you're gonna watch an Astro Boy TV show You know like a lot, you know watch a little bit of the 60s one So you get your history read, you know, some of the manga.

829
00:56:35,715 --> 00:56:36,920
Scott: so you get the deal with that.

830
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:39,030
Scott: You don't need to read all the volumes plus.

831
00:56:39,051 --> 00:56:40,759
Scott: there's way too many of them and they're hard to get.

832
00:56:41,241 --> 00:56:42,507
Scott: You know relatively hard to get.

833
00:56:42,527 --> 00:56:45,320
Scott: the newer series like we said terrible dub.

834
00:56:45,781 --> 00:56:49,754
Scott: So, you know, it's if you can get it subtitled by all means watch that.

835
00:56:49,774 --> 00:56:51,700
Scott: it's supposedly awesome even though I've never seen it.

836
00:56:52,001 --> 00:56:53,187
Scott: But I've heard the dub was terrible.

837
00:56:53,649 --> 00:56:58,839
Scott: But if you're gonna watch a whole Astro Boy This 80s one is where it's at.

838
00:57:00,521 --> 00:57:02,147
Rym: On that note we could watch another episode.

839
00:57:02,188 --> 00:57:03,452
Rym: We're actually only about.

840
00:57:03,733 --> 00:57:05,400
Rym: we're a little over halfway through it right now.

841
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:06,851
Rym: There's 52 episodes of it.

842
00:57:06,911 --> 00:57:07,193
Rym: That's it.

843
00:57:07,213 --> 00:57:08,802
Scott: That's a pretty good number I think because it's.

844
00:57:08,903 --> 00:57:17,317
Scott: it's like a limited series, but it's not too short and since it's you know, very episodic But there are some sort of you know, continuing plot threads.

845
00:57:17,377 --> 00:57:20,030
Scott: It's like Like think about Voltron.

846
00:57:20,090 --> 00:57:33,220
Scott: right when you watch Voltron Every single episode of Voltron is pretty much they're always fighting You know row beasts that come from the biggest bet, you know, the only bet only villain is only one villain.

847
00:57:33,401 --> 00:57:39,360
Rym: They always happen to solve the problem just before the end of the episode right in Astro Boy, right?

848
00:57:40,002 --> 00:57:52,660
Scott: Every episode is sort of its own thing, but like there are so many episodes with Atlas in them So Atlas you'll get like an Atlas episode like once every five episodes or once every ten or something, you know, they're interspersed.

849
00:57:53,002 --> 00:57:55,138
Scott: So it's like there's this Atlas storyline.

850
00:57:55,178 --> 00:58:03,220
Scott: now Usually in like modern shonen stuff when you have a storyline with a villain all the episodes will be clumped up like so in Naruto.

851
00:58:03,381 --> 00:58:06,480
Scott: It's like first ten episodes fight the guy with the big sword.

852
00:58:07,042 --> 00:58:09,733
Scott: Next ten episodes fight the guy with the ninja stars, you know.

853
00:58:09,793 --> 00:58:13,355
Scott: next ten episodes fight, you know It's like that or like one piece right.

854
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:21,347
Scott: first We fight the clown, you know in this arc and then we fight this right in Astro Boy The arc is spread out.

855
00:58:21,508 --> 00:58:24,940
Scott: So there's the Atlas arc, but the Atlas arc isn't all at once.

856
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:27,428
Scott: It's not like ten episodes in a row of Atlas.

857
00:58:27,609 --> 00:58:31,140
Scott: It's ten episodes spread out over the series of Atlas.

858
00:58:31,281 --> 00:58:32,687
Scott: You know, it's like he comes and he goes.

859
00:58:32,767 --> 00:58:35,780
Scott: it's ten episodes spread out over the series of skunk.

860
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:39,120
Scott: You know, he comes and he goes and I kind of like it more that way.

861
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:41,008
Scott: It's more like a cowboy bebop kind of thing.

862
00:58:41,028 --> 00:58:43,680
Scott: You know, it's like vicious is spread out over the series.

863
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:49,076
Scott: It's not all at once and I think that actually gives a lot more power to.

864
00:58:49,517 --> 00:58:56,707
Scott: you know, the character You know, that is the the villain in the in the series then putting them all together does plus It's just one thing it.

865
00:58:56,869 --> 00:59:12,383
Rym: that really strikes me if nothing else and I hope it strikes you too that you watch this and you compare it to American television aimed at a similar audience in America, you know children of that age at that time and You can just.

866
00:59:12,463 --> 00:59:21,310
Rym: it's so much more mature and real and kids learn a lot more from Astro Boy than they will for most of The cartoons that were on in 1980 in America.

867
00:59:21,651 --> 00:59:22,393
Scott: Yeah Astro Boy.

868
00:59:22,413 --> 00:59:23,436
Scott: It just you know, it's got.

869
00:59:23,536 --> 00:59:28,755
Scott: basically it's got you know Three elements going on, you know, it's got the element of quality animation, right?

870
00:59:28,796 --> 00:59:39,479
Scott: It's got the element of Science fiction and it's got the element of Non-simplistic morality and that's those are the three things Astro Boy has.
